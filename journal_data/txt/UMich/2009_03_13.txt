In Big Ten opener, 'M'routs Iowa
Led by strong, inside presence
of forward DeShawn Sims,
Blue all but seals NCAA bid
By JASON KOHLER
Daily Sports Writer
INDIANAPOLIS - Standing by a locker in Conseco
Fieldhouse, redshirt freshman Laval Lucas-Perry
radiated the confidence of Michigan fans throughout
the country:
"I think we've already made it to the NCAA Tour-
nament," Lucas-Perry said.
Junior forward DeShawn Sims scored Michigan's
first 14 points on 7-of-7 shooting to lead the seventh-
seeded Wolverines to a 73-45 win over No. 10 seed
Iowa in the first round of the Big Ten Tournament
yesterday afternoon.
The victory all but cements Michigan's spot in the
NCAA Tournament, its first tournament bid in 10
years. The Wolverines will
learn if they made the tour- IOWA 45
nament, their tournament MICHIGAN 73
seed and where they'll be
headed for NCAA first-round play on Sunday. -
Although the Wolverines tried not to think about
the Big Dance, they knew they could ill afford to drop
a game to a team with a sub-.500 record.
"We didn't want to put too much stress on it and
stress it too much to where we felt like we had pres-
sure on us," sophomore forward Manny Harris said.
"But it was definitely a goal. We thought about it."
Sims used the pressure as motivation early. Hes
exploded for 27 points - 18 of them in the first half - ------
and hit 12 of16 shots.
"You can tell from the start, even from the hotel
room, you know when you're ready to go," Harris said.
"He talks about it. He says something about it. His
whole body language is different.",
And Michigan (9-9 Big Ten, 20-12 overall) didn't
shy away from feeding the hot hand.
"You feel like when you give it to him, he's going
to score," Harris said. "You sometimes don't even go
rebound, which we got to do. But that's how our team
builds off him scoring and him getting into it." ;
No other Wolverine scored until redshirt freshman
guard Laval Lucas-Perry drained a 3-pointer eight SAM WOLSON/Daly
minutes into the first half. Manny Harris soars past owa defenders during Michigan's 73-45 victory over Iowa in the first round of

upperclassmen
By VERONICA MENALDI
Daily StaffReporter
Many upperclassmen on cam-
pus might shy away from resi-
dence hall life after their first
years of sharing rooms and halls
mostly filled with freshmen. But
University Housing is trying to
change that.
Stockwell Residence Hall, a
former all-female dorm current-
ly undergoing renovations, will
reopen in Fall 2009 as a coedu-
cational residence hall geared
toward sophomores and upper
classmen.
University Housingspokesman
Peter Logan said the residence
hall will not house any freshmen
and will feature programming to
enhance the second-year experi-
ence.
"It will be unique among any of
the residence halls," he said..
Logan said the prevalence of
single rooms in Stockwell was one
of the main reasons Housing offi-
cials chose to gear the residence

hall toward sophomores.
"Since returning students
tend to prefer single rooms, we
made a decision to create more
of a second-year and older com-
munity for Stockwell," Logan
said.
Ashley Londy, president of
the Residence Halls Association,
said Stockwell has a majority of
single rooms available in a rela-
tively central location, making it
a desirable option for returning
students.
"Stockwell has a lot of single
rooms, and it's interesting to see
more single rooms available to
both men and women," Londy
said. "That way they areboth able
to enjoy having that option that's
a limited commodity."
Londy said she hopes the
uniquely sophomore experience
offered in Stockwell will at least
draw more students into consid-
ering continued living in the resi-
dence halls after their freshman
year.
"I hope it attracts more people
to stay in the residence halls,"
she said. "I really hope people
recognize that the University is
responding to the needs of the
.students to make sure the stu-
dents have whatthey want, which
is amazing."

Assembly officials
report increase in
funding requests
By AMY MUNSLOW
Daily StaffReporter
Few organizations have found
sufficient cover from the fallout of
the nation's economic downturn
and student groups on campus are

no different.
With students forced to bud-
get more carefully, some campus
organizations are facing decreased
recruitment and alack of funds.
LisaAverill, the treasurer for the
Michigan Student Assembly, said
rising numbers of funding requests
from various student organizations
are overwhelming MSA's Budget
Priorities Coinmittee and Com-
munity Service Commission, the
two MSA committees that allocate
funds for organizations on campus.
"Right now, we absolutely have

had to explore where we could pull
money from to fund the massive
influx of legitimate, well-filled out
BPC/CSC applications," she wrote
in an e-mail.
Averill, an LSA junior, added that
the primary reason for this flood of
funding applications is decreased
participation in campus groups,
especially those with membership
fees.
"With lower recruitment, these
organizations have to reach out
even more to fund their events,

country's problems
By MALLORY JONES

Three anthropologists said
yesterday that the solution to the
increasing violence in Afghani-
stan might just be to put the Tali-
ban back in power.

In a panel discussion hosted by
the Center for Russian and East
European Studies yesterday, the
experts discussed their solutions
to the conflict in Afghanistan.
David Edwards, professor of
social sciences in the anthropol-
ogy and sociology at Williams
College, Nazif Shahrani, profes-
sor of anthropology at Indiana
University and Alessandro Mon-
sutti, a social anthropologist and
postdoctoral fellow at Yale Uni-
versity, spoke to a room of about
60 people. The event was also
broadcast to two other locations

on campus.
Douglas Northrop, director of
the Center for Russian and East
European Studies, said the depart-
ment decided to host the event
after students expressed interest
in the complex country.
"(These speakers) spent years
livingthere, learningits languages,
and understanding its cultures,"
Northrop wrote in an e-mail.
"Given that the USA is now send-
ing tens of thousands of troops into

TAMID connects business

Organization
educates members
on economic matters,

By MALLORY BEBERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
Sometimes a person's best ideas
are generated around 3 a.m., while
hanging out with friends in your
freshman residence hall.
At least this was the case for
Sasha Gribov and Eitan Ingall,

the co-founders of TAMID Israel
Investment Group, a student-led
nonprofit organization aiming to
bridge the gap between American
business students and the Israeli
economy.
"We've started something that
we think could revolutionize the
connection between our genera-
tion of business students and the
state of Israel," said Gribov, a Busi-
ness junior. Ingall is an LSA junior
concentrating in organizational
studies.
Gribov added that the group's
members were motivated to create
this opportunity for students, out of

their lovefor Israel.
"Israel is a huge part of our iden-
tity and who we are as young peo-
ple, as Americans and as Jews and
we wanted to create somethingthat
would facilitate that connection for
other members of our generation,"
he said.
At thebeginning of this semester,
20 freshmen and sophomores with
a shared interest in business and
Israel joined forces with TAMID's
15-member executive board to cre-
ate the group's first membership
class.

NEW YORK
Bernie Madoff
pleads guilty to
ponzi scheme
Bernard Madoff's victims got
what they wanted to see, but not
what they wanted to hear.
Saying he was "deeply sorry and
ashamed," the disgraced financier
pleaded guilty yesterday to perhaps
the biggest swindle in Wall Street
history and was led off in handcuffs
to begin serving a sentence expect-
ed to be up to 150 years in prison.
While some bilked investors
were delighted by the spectacle, the
bigger questions were left unan-
swered: What happened to all the
money, people's life savings, their
college tuition, as much as $65 bil-
lion in all? Who helped him pull
off the fraud that turned a well-
respected investment professional
into a symbol of Wall Street greed
amid the economic meltdown?
"So he spends the rest of his life
in jail - is that justice? People's
lives are ruined," said Adriane
Biondo of Los Angeles, one of five
members of her family who lost
money with Madoff. "Where's the
money, Bernie?"
LANSING
State Senate passes
bill to help ailing
automobile sales
People would pay less sales tax
when they trade in an old vehicle and
buy a new or used one under legisla-
tion passed yesterday that's designed
to boost auto sales in Michigan.
Gov. Jennifer Granholm opposes
the bill approved 30-7 in the Repub-
lican-led state Senate and sent to
the Democratic-controlled House.
The measure would make Mich-
igan like 38 other states and apply
the trade-in value of a car to the cal-
culation of the 6 percent sales tax
when a new or used car is bought.
The legislation also would apply
to RVs, boats, snowmobiles and
heavy earth-moving equipment.
Vehicle buyers now pay sales tax
on the full price of a new or used car
even if they usually owe less than
the sales price because of a trade-in.
"We're one of six crazy states
that does it this way," Sen. Alan
Sanborn,R-Richmond, said."We've
got to change our mind-set."
WASHINGTON
Obama says
economy is "not as
bad as we think"
Confronting misgivings, even
in his own party, President Barack
Obama mounted a stout defense of
his blueprint to overhaul the econo-
my yesterday, declaring the nation-
al crisis is "not as bad as we think"
and his plans will speed recovery.
Challenged to provide encour-
agement as the nation's "confi-
dence builder in chief," Obama said
Americans shouldn't be whipsawed
by bursts of either bad or good
news and he was "highly optimis-

tic" about the long term.
The president's proposals for
major health care, energy and edu-
cation changes in the midst of eco-
nomic hard times faced skepticism
from both Democrats and Repub-
licans on Capitol Hill, as senators
questioned his budget outlook and
the deficits it envisions in the mid-
dle of the next decade.
But Obama, speaking to top exec-
utives of the Business Roundtable,
expressed an optimistic vision and
r called for patience.
VATICAN CITY, ITALY
Pope acknowledges
church mistakes
Pope Benedict XVI has made an
unusual public acknowledgment
of Vatican mistakes and turmoil
in his church over an outreach to
ultraconservatives that led to his
lifting the excommunication of a
Holocaust-denying bishop.
In an attempt to end one of the
mostserious crises ofhis papacy, he
said in a letter released Thursday
that the Vatican must make greater
use of the Internet to prevent other
controversies.
The Vatican took the rare step of
releasing the German-born pope's
personal account of the incident
addressed to Catholic bishops
around the world.
Vatican spokesman the Rev.
Federico Lombardi said the letter
- released in six languages - was
"really unusual and deserving of
maximum attention."

Yesterdayafternoon,thePendle-
ton Room in the Union was filled to
capacity with students and faculty
as Nobel Prize-winning economist
James Heckman lectured about
the role that early life investments,
both material and emotional, plays
in human development.
Heckman, who is the Henry
Schultz Distinguished Service
Professor of Economics at the
University of Chicago, spoke about
ongoing studies in the economics,
psychology and sociology fields
examining the role that gaps in
cognitive and noncognitive abili-
ties play in children's growth.

But the Indian American Stu-
dent Association, which doesn't

also been feeling the effects of the
struggling economy in other ways,
according to Ross School of Busi-
ness junior Anuj Lal, the group's
logistics coordinator.
"We have a 3-on-3 basketball
tournament comingup in April and
the cost for renting the IM Build-
ing went up by almost $300 from
lastcyear," he said. "When we asked
them aboutthe price increase, they
said it was the economy."

American Movement for Israel,

brook, a member of TAMID's
executive board, said the orga-
nization helps fill a vacuum on
campus.
"We looked around campus
and saw that if you wanted to
connect to Israel you could do
so politically, you could do so
religiously, but there was never
a channel to connect with Israel
economically from a business
stand point," Levenbrook said.
Members of TAMID partici-
pate in a three-part program that
includes education, fund man-
agement and fellowship.
Business junior Elianna Starr,
another member of TAMID's
executive board, said members
are currently involved in the
educational program. Students
attend weekly seminars led by
University professors and Israeli
professionals to learn about basic
investing skills and the structure
of the Israeli economy. Students
also participate in debriefing ses-
sions that emphasize Israeli cul-

interventions and family dynam-
ics play a key role in children's
cognitive development.
He said parents must invest
in their children early because it
is significantly harder for them
to experience greater growth in
development, by the time they are
adolescents.
"We know that cognitive ability
plays a verybig role, and that these
gaps are opening up very early,"
he said. "If you condition cogni-
tive ability you are more likely to
be goingto college. Those gaps are
largely there by age three."
He added that those born into
disadvantaged environments strug-
gle to achieve a successful level of
development. These disadvantages
can range from a lack of resources
to decreased parental involvement.
LSA senior Elizabeth Kirk
said she agreed with Heckman's
claims about the importance of
early childhood development.

before the economic crisis hit.
"So far, things havebeen ok," she
said. "But it's possible that we will
feel the effects next semester."
Goldstein added that the group
will have to "think out of thebox" to
continue to fund its programming.
Encompass, an organization
that aims to bring together mul-
ticultural performance groups,
has been hit especially hard by the
struggling economy.
Ani Toumajan, one of the
group's executive board members,
said ticket sales for the group's
main event - a charity perfor-
mance that took place last Sunday
- fell far below previous years.
"It was barely enough to pay for
the venue," she said. "We are lucky
to have funds that we have saved
in order to pay for other costs."
Toumajan said she attributed

we've actually talked to business

interesting to hear what they
think about business,"he said.

tant to me," said Kirk. "But I think
it's a failure of school systems to
facilitate ways for families to be
part of their children's academic
experience rather than a failure
of the families and I think that is
one of the failures of our educa-
tional system. But I do agree with
his point that those are skills you
can't make up for later."
Public Policy Prof. Bob Schoeni
said Heckman was chosen as the
keynote speaker for this year's
conference because of his cutting-
edge research in the field.
Though Heckman's research
is incomplete, Schoeni said he
believes the findings will support
the growing interest in the effects
of early life investment in children.
"My guess is that within the
next three to 10 years we are going
to have better data and ideas and
methods to answer the questions
that we can't answer yet," he said.
"I think there is a growing appre-
ciation for the fact that early life
investments are very important.
I believe the policy community is
beginning to realize this."

raise and advertise for next year's
show in order to stay afloat.
"Next year, however, there is
definitely going to be a change,"
she said. "We have to fundraise
or apply for grants from different
University organizations and pro-
grams."
Though many groups have been
forced to cut back, the University's
chapter of Relay For Life hasn't
been affected, banking more
fundraising dollars and recruiting
more participants than last year,
said co-chair Chris Britten, an
LSA senior.
"Despite the economy, we set
our goals for this year's fundrais-
ing at the highest point they have
ever been so our event can keep
growing," Britten said. "I think we
may still reach those numbers."

Levenbrook said students'
involvement in the group doesn't
end after they go abroad. Once
they return from Israel, students
have the opportunity to further
build their leadership skills.
"They are given the chance to
come onto the executive board
and manage the future pools of
applicants," he said.
At the moment, TAMID is in
the process of raising capital.
Gribov said they aspire to raise $1
million in the next year through
donations and private investors.
The money raised will help to
sustain TAMID's presence at the
University and will be used pri-
marily as scholarship money to
send members abroad.
Gribov said he hopes TAMID
will become a national network
of young American business lead-
ers with a vested commitment to
Israel.
"We expect in the next five
years we are going to have chap-
ters sprouting up all over the
nation," Gribov said.

FIRST ROUND
From Page 1
Harris, a first-team All-Big Ten
selection, got hot later. But his
passing, uthit shots, fueled Mich-
igan. Harris dished out five of his
team-high eight assists in the first
half. He also scored 18 points.
"We've strived for balance on
the team all year long," Beilein said.
"Sometimes,youjust can't do it.And
this year, we've been able to have a
good balance as the season went on.
I think it's been a key to our success
right now in February and March."
The contrast in 3-point shooting
percentage between the teams was
glaring.
Like Michigan, Iowa's suc-
cess rides on 3-pointers. But the
Hawkeyes (5-13, 15-17) hit just four
of their 17 shots from beyond the
are. Iowa shot a dismal 33.3 per-
cent from the field.
The Wolverines shot59.2 percent
and were 10-of-22 from downtown.
But it wasn't just the high shoot-
ing percentage that pleased Beilein.
When he looked at the stat sheet, he
couldn'thelp butsmile whentalking
about how the Wolverines notched
assists on 22 of their 29 baskets.
Since Iowa's defense closes down
on players who dribble drive, the
pass is critical for opening scoring
opportunities. Michigan's offense
quickly rotated the ball and often
hit Sims open in the paint.

Logan said while Housing

While thespeakers disagreed on
some specifics, all three were cer-
tain that the United States failed in
its effort in Afghanistan under the
Bush administration. They all said
they are hopeful for the opportu-
nities of the future.
"We have to start acknowledg-
ing that what has been done since
2001 is a disaster," Monsutti said.
"First we have to agree on that."
Accordingto Shahrani, the Unit-
ed States went wrong by trying to
impose governance on the people
of Afghanistan. To move forward,
he said the strategy should allow
the people in the country to elect
their own local government in line
with their cultural values, even if
it means giving the Taliban limited
government power.
"We have to accept the principle
of community self-governance
based on community values,"

five games, scored just 10p pints.
Fifth-year senior C.J. Lee, five
inches shorter than Kelly, tightly
defended the Iowa guard when
Michigan used its man-to-moao
defense.
Just two players finished in dou-
ble figures for the Hawkeyes, who
looked nothing like the team that
beat the Wolverines 70-60 in over-
time Feb. 22 in Iowa City.
Michigan led by 21 at the half,
tying its largest halftime lead of
the season. The Wolverines' other
21-point halftime lead came against
Florida Gulf Coast on Dec 22, an
eventual 76-59 Michigan win.
The Wolverines will face No. 2
seed Illinois (11-7, 23-8) Friday at
6:30 p.m. in the second round of
the conference tournament. Mich-
igan split its season series with
the Fighting Illini, but the teams
haven't played each other since
Jan.14.
Sims hopes to carry the same
swagger he had yesterday into
today's contest. And he thinks
Illinois should be a little scared to
face his Michigan team that might
have just played its best game of
the season.
"I think if we were sitting, and
we had the upper seed, and seeing
a team compete like we competed
against Iowa, it would bother me
and I would want to have played a
game first," Sims said. "It's hard to
play in tournaments when a team
has already played and they're
already loose."
In November, Housing offi-
cials announced that the for-
merly all-female residence hall
would become co-ed, a change
that members of RHA had been
requesting for a while.
"We had over twice as many
rooms in all female houses as
opposed to the requests," Logan
said. "A number of women were
assigned to an all-female housing
even though they hadn't requested
it."
In addition to providing sopho-
mores with a new type of living
experience, the residence hall will
also feature upgraded amenities
like new community spaces, cen-
tral air conditioning and wireless
Internet, Logan said.
Shahrani said.
Monsutti added that Americans

"Let's reverse the situation and

most. Schrock, who attended the
event, is in the Navy ROTC pro-
gram atthe Universityandbelieves
he will eventually be deployed to
Afghanistan. He said in order to
implement the ideas presented in
the talk, a major shift in thinking
would be necessary.
"It's interesting to think about
putting the Taliban in power
when we came in to topple them
basically," Schrock said. "There's
so much negative connotation
with the Taliban its interesting to

Spending for the future
The federal stimulus must invest in long-term solutions
L ately, public attentionhasbeen focused on PresidentBarack
Obama's budget, fresh out of a much-debated stay in Con-
gress. As the Congressional drama unfolded, the debate
over the $787 billion economic stimulus package that Congress
passed last month seemed to be fading from the national con-
sciousness. According to The New York Times, the stimulus will
be the single biggest expenditure of the U.S. government since
World War II. Government intervention is appropriate to help
heal the limping economy. Rather than indiscriminately throw-
ing money everywhere, the government is right to concentrate
on several key areas. The stimulus package must be used where

it's needed most - the future.
It's no secret that the U.S. economy is in
trouble. The failure of the housing market
has left Americans with less money to spend
and businesses with less people to serve. As
a result, the economy has struggled to stay
afloat in recent months. While there is no
overnight solution, a responsible increase
in government spending could contribute to
economic recovery. That means the funds
need to go to opportunities that will give
the country future returns.
Obama has designated health care,
sustainable energy and education as the
major recipients of the stimulus. But in
the tradition of President Franklin D.
Roosevelt, who negotiated the country
through the Great Depression by making
difficult spending decisions, Obama could
also direct some of the stimulus money to
infrastructure improvements. The "2009
Infrastructure Report Card," published by
the American Society of Civil Engineers,
gave the United States a D. On Feb.14, CNN
reported that $48 billion of the stimulus is
already dedicated to infrastructure, but
that's far from the $2.2 trillion in repairs
the ASCE claimed is needed to reach "ade-
quate conditions." Funding these upgrades
would create jobs and improve the quality
of our transportation systems, communi-
ties and environmental structures.
To find other long-term solutions to
invest in, the federal government should
look to Michigan. In our state, Gov. Jenni-
fer Granholm is working to revitalize the
failing economy by advocating the expan-
sion of alternative energy, which could be
a vital new industry. She has been cam-
paigning for an implementation of green

energy options, most notably wind energy.
Nationally, a "green economy" will create
jobs and more environmentally friendly
energy options for consumers, ushering
in a new generation of energy technology.
Investments in green energy may seem
expensive in the short term, but they end
up saving money in the long run.
But to realize the goals of more economi-
cally and environmentally sound energy
practices, a college-educated workforce is
essential. To make that happen, every stu-
dent who is interested in going to college
should have the opportunity. While the
recent increase in federal funding for Pell
Grants is helpful, universities are desperate-
ly in need of funds to keep tuition affordable
for their students. And while the federal gov-
ernment needs to place an emphasis on mak-
ing college a cost-effective opportunity for
students, primary education can't be left out
of this plan. Public schools across the nation
must be adequately funded to ensure that
students have a solid foundation for college.
Of all institutions that need health care,
Obama has declared the health care system
to be the most deserving. He couldn't be
more right - we need a health care system
that guarantees every person the right to
proper medical treatment. But in addition to
saving the nation's ailing health care system,
infrastructure, alternative energy and edu-
cation are absolutely vital.
At the same time, it would be naive to
assume that the stimulus could fix all of our
problems in one fell swoop. But regardless of
its limitations, the stimulus can have a posi-
tive effect if the federal government invests
it with the future in mind.

With the recession only get-
ting worse, politicians are
starting to consider the
unthinkable: let-
ting the auto indus-
try go bankrupt.
Economists and
politicians are con-1
sidering the future ;
of the car in the
United States and
who needs to shoul-
der its burdens. BEN
The short-term
answer may not lie CALECA
with hybrid cars,- - __
as many Americans
might expect, but with smarter, more
economical designs that use readily
available engine technologies.
If you're looking for a car that would
make even a Prius blush with envy in
terms of fuel efficiency, the best place to
start is Europe. Cars overseas are gen-
erally much smaller and are designed
to be just enough for a person to get
around. The lineup of Opel cars, a Ger-
man manufacturer owned by General
Motors, has a significantly better aver-
age gas mileage across the board than
GM's domestic lineup. Much of the
savings in gas mileage simply because
companies manufacture lighter cars
abroad than in the U.S.
Another difference in Europe is the
prominence of diesel-powered cars.
Diesel engines, once hated for being
excessively dirty and loud, are now
commonplace in Europe. They excel-
lently power small cars and even take
into account the high cost of diesel
fuel in comparison to gasoline. Mile-
age for small hatchbacks easily tops
that of any hybrid. A diesel-powered
BMW S Series, a fairly sizeable luxury
car, boasts a competitive fuel economy

in comparison to existing hybrids due
to good aerodynamics and an efficient
diesel engine. These engines are also
more sustainable through the use of
biodiesel, which is far less energy-
intensive to produce than bio-fuels for
gasoline cars.
The reason we don't see many of
these cars in the U.S. is because the
U.S. has different regulations. Euro-
pean countries ease nitrogen oxide
emissions regulations for these small
diesels because overall, they are more
efficient. These nitrogen compounds
formphotochemicalsmogandcontrib-
ute to global warming. Furthermore,
safety test standards for European
cars are run on an almost incompat-
ible rubric to U.S. safety standards,
making many European models illegal
due to safety technicalities.
The good news is that there are
solutions to these problems. The
appearance of a few diesels like
those on the market in the U.S. - the
Mercedes-Benz E320 Bluetec sedan,
for example - shows that there are
ways to reduce the emissions of diesel
vehicles to levels about the same as a
gasoline car - or better. One of the
more novel approaches is a urea tank
that nearly eliminates nitrogen oxide
emissions. Better catalytic converters,
part of the exhaust system to remove
emissions, are another option. With
increased focus on developing these
technologies, diesels could become
a viable engine in this country, even
under strict emissions controls.
On the matter of safety standards,
there are a number of fundamental
differences in the automobile culture
of the U.S. that need to be considered.
First aid, car maintenance and even
economical driving instruction are
often required to obtain a license in

Europe. Europeans also base their
crash test regulations on the assump-
tion that occupants use their seat belts.
Safety standards in the U.S. consider
both belted and unbelted occupants,
resulting in more emphasis on air bags
and heavier designs thatmay or maynot
be necessarily safer for belted drivers.
The U.S. should
look overseas to
improve its cars.
For car companies to have compati-
ble standards, compromises need to be
made. Focusing more on accident pre-
vention and making motorists more
responsible for theirown safetywould
go a long way toward allowing auto-
makers to introduce street-legal, fuel-
efficient cars in America. And where a
change in driver culture won't make
up for safety differences, automakers
should invest in lighter materials that
don't hinder fuel economy.
Of course, there is no greater moti-
vation for a smarter fleet of cars than
a public that isn't wary of smaller cars.
The days of owning a big SUV are
rightfully over, and Americans need to
take the initiative to warm up to small-
er, lighter cars. As long as the public
is afraid of driving something smaller
than the large plodding symbols of a
languishing auto industry that we cur-
rently drive, there won't be an automo-
tive revolution anytime soon.

negative conclusions. Even when the
pictures of a terribly bruised Rihanna
were released, it is possible that tmz.
com received digitally altered pho-
tos (Rihanna - The Face of a Battered
Woman, 2/22/2009) that "enhanced"
Rihanna's swelling. Nevertheless,
with the reports and the pictures all
pointing to physical abuse, I couldn't
help but be reminded of the black com-
munity's association with patriarchal
violence.
In her book, "Feminism is for Every-
body" feminist and social activist bell
hooks asserts that patriarchal violence
in the home "is based on the belief that
it is acceptable for a more powerful
individual to control others through
various forms of coercive force." She
uses the term patriarchal violence as
opposed to domestic violence because
unlike domestic violence, patriarchal
violence reminds us of its connection
to male domination. Regardless of
Brown's actions, it was acceptance of
this male domination that led some to
defend his actions.
According to msnbc.com (Kanye
West defends Chris .Brown, 3/2/2009),
Kanye West told a VHt "Storytell-
ers" audience, "Can't we give Chris a
break?" He likened Brown's alleged
mistake to O.J. Simpson and Michael
Jackson's infamous alleged mistakes.

Latimes.com quoted one Brown
defender (Readers defend Chris Brown
in the Rihanna incident, 2/13/2009)
saying, "I'm still going to support
Chris Brown until the end... Obviously,
she provoked him and everyone makes
mistakes so I'm not going to down talk
him nor try to bring him down like the
white media." Itseems there are mixed
responses from the black community.
The media has posed some impor-
tant questions. Is Brown's "mistake" a
one-time thing? Is something Rihanna
did to Brown grounds for the alleged
pummeling? Is the "white media" con-
juringnegative images against Brown?
These questions must not be ignored,
but accurate answers can't be found
in the simplistic context of domestic
or patriarchal violence. Only a racial
lens can give clarity to the profound
nature of patriarchal violence within
the black community and how whites
respond.
Transforming the conversation
of domestic abuse into one of black
patriarchal violence, as Frank Rob-
erts of thedailyvoice.com claims
(Why We Can't Support Chris Brown,
2/24/2009), immediately roots the
discussion "to a longer history of sex-
ism and misogyny; to a history which
has systematically preconditioned us
to believe that physical violence is a
sane and natural way to put a woman
'in her place'." In other words, when
blacks are a part of patriarchal vio-
lence, they are instantly connected
with certain representations of blacks
that, while representing a minority,
still predominate many impressions
and stereotypes of the "violent nature"
of blacks. The so-called "white media"
did not hesitate to pathologize Brown's
actions as such. Mtv.com published an
article days after the incident claim-
ing that Chris Brown was haunted
by his family's history of domestic
violence. Instead of this analysis, we
could simply condemn patriarchal
violence and those who endorse it. If
it is implied that Brown's violence was
passed down, then by the same logic,
Brown, black men and their progeny
are doomed to a legacy of violence.
Many media outlets glorify the
black pimp, a lifestyle that includes, as
a requisite, patriarchal violence - or as
self-proclaimed pimp Ice Tea puts it,

"Bitches get smacked". In bell hooks'
book "We Real Cool", she documents
these historical and current images of
patriarchal violence. While she holds
blacks responsible for the images they
personify, she holds whites respon-
sible for endorsing these images and
helping to make violent representa-
tions as opposed to more positive ones.
The more these prominent, negative
images are endorsed and personi-
fied, the more they seem to take form,
enforcing the illusion that black men
are particularly violent.
Racial prejudices
affect perceptions
of Chris Brown.
The above context is necessary to
understand the depth of Chris Brown's
alleged actions, Brown and Rihanna's
subsequent alleged reconciliation and
the black community's responsibility
to respond to these issues. If Brown
is guilty of assault and violent threats,
we must not give him a break. But we
must not pathologize him and other
black men as if he is a part of a legacy
of black patriarchal violence. If we
learn that Rihanna did "provoke" him,
we must strongly question the implica-
tions of justifying brutal violence as an
appropriate response to an annoyance.
Strife as a result of patriarchal violence
could, as bell hooks puts it, "ignite the
flames of a gender war so intense that
it has practically consumed the his-
torical memory of black males and
females, working together equally for
liberation, creating love and family
and community."
This memory is the image that
should dominate impressions of the
black community. But instead, black
patriarchal violence and an appropri-
ate response still troubles the black
community, and many whites still
endorse the most negative historical
image of blacks.

A poignant love triangle

Phoenix shines in his
best role since
'Walk the Line'
By EMILY BOUDREAU
DailyArts Writer
"Two Lovers" opens with a
shot of Leonard Kraditor (Joaquin
Phoenix, "Walk the Line") walking
down a boardwalk in slow motion
before taking a
suicidal plunge *
into an icy bay.
Since his fian- Two LOVers
cee left him,
Leonard has At the
struggled with Michigan
depression. He 2929
lives with his
parents who, in an attempt to help
both their retirement plans and
their son, introduce him to Sandra
(Vinessa Shaw, "3:10 to Yuma"), the
daughter of a business partner who
obviously likes him more than he
likes her.
It's not until he meets Michelle
(Gwyneth Paltrow, "The Good
Night"), however, that he begins to
start feeling emotions again. Unfor-
tunately, Michelle is the mistress of
a married lawyer and sees Leonard
as a brotherly best friend. Leonard
soon finds himself tangled between
the unattainable girl he loves and
the girl who loves him.
But "Two Lovers" does not come
across as a typical romantic movie.
While the film plays with the idea of
love, it carries an unexpected emp-

see Leonard's struggle as he waits
for Michelle under the disapprov-
ing eyes in the black and white pho-
tos of his relatives.
Despite Phoenix's new "career"
in the hip-hop industry and antics
on "The Late Show," he gives a great
showing. It's not at all the sort of
thing someone would expect from
an actor-turned-rapper. And Pal-
trow and Shaw are solid as doomed,
trapped girls in love with men who
don't love them back.
Leonard's mother Ruth (Isabella
Rossellini, "Infamous") is one of the
most compelling characters in the
film; she is overbearing but manages
to attract empathy as she presses her
ear to walls and peeks under doors
to listen in on her son.
Director James Gray ("The,
Yards") seeks to extricate the
masked emotions of the characters
through subtleties in the camera
work. He incorporates a shot of a.
single eye turned to a blank wall
as Leonard makes the choice that
will seal his destiny. Shots like this
are contrasted with disgustingly
humorous images of the food at an
awkward dinner party. Gray is able
to insinuate that perhaps love does
not truly exist at times in the film.
When Sandra presents Leonard
with a pair of gloves while they're at
a restaurant, Leonard simply nods
to the waiter and asks for the check.
While the basic schematic ele-
ments of the plot are the same over-
used formula found in any other
romantic movie, the romantic trian-
gle works in "Two Lovers" to create
something fresh and poignant.

to increase with Dead Oceans
every release,
and with its music appearing in TV
shows like ABC's "Greek" and in the
2008 film"Nick and Norah's Infinite
Playlist," the band has seen a major
boost recently.
Bishop Allen's latest studio effort
Grr... is the band's third studio
release. on the whole, it's a quiet,
relaxing LP more suited for passive
than active listening, but the band
throws in a few punchy songs that
give the record variety and praise-
worthiness.
"Don't Hide Away" is the most
fetching song on the album, which is
quite a feat considering the record's
consistent level of addictiveness. It

begins with piano and, compellingly
enough, maracas. The piano chords
are unusually rhythmic, keeping
perfect time with the drumbeat as
a tape organ-sounding keyboard
plays in the background. During the
chorus, vocalist Justin Rice sings,
"Don't hide away / too high or low
/ I'd really like to see you / don't
you know" to a background of beat-
matching, syllabic chanting.
"Cue the Elephants" showcases
Grr...'s more rambunctious side.
Guitarist Christian Rudder uses
a tremolo technique at the begin-
ning of the song before diving into
rapid strumming during the verse.
The drumming sounds like a tick-
ing clock awaiting the cue for the
impending elephants the title prom-
ises. Then the song breaks into a
smooth, flowing chorus and it's as if
the cue sounded. The song's inten-
sity climbs with a powerful drum-
fill near its close before the track
finishes abruptly.
Most of the songs on Grr... are
charismatic compositions, but
"Shanghaied" is by far the most
intriguing. Although its title con-
jures stereotypical images of kung-

fu or Ch

ina, the song itself embodies majority of the song. Rice's vocals,
an Old-West feel with its while fitting to Bishop Allen's indie-
-western influenced guitars. folk-rock sound, aren't always the
erse gets going, the guitars most intriguing, and the female
a Spanish flavor, and the voice is a welcome change. Rudder's
use of arpeggios and damping on an
acoustic guitar, along with excited
horns, creates a slightly tropical feel
hop Allen has that hints of summer and beaches,
teasing any Michigan college stu-
ver been this dent who might hear the track.
"The Magpie," the final song on
the album, is an eerie lullaby, and
Rice's use of end rhyme contrib-
utes to the nursery-song feeling. He
ound like hooves pounding whispers rather than sings, but the
mpacting sand. The chorus instrumentation - a quiet accordion
dibly twee-poppy, with Rice and xylophone in the background

dances, you'll cringe at the occa-
sional line-botching and you'll
breathe a sigh of relief after he
clears each hurdle. In short, tak-
ing in Fallon on a nightly basis is
truly like raising a child in fast-
motion.
Right before our eyes, Fallon,
after a somewhat shaky start, is
maturing into a competent and
extremely likable host. He has
mounted an impressive campaign
to win America's affection since
taking over the reigns of "Late
Night" from Conan O'Brien.
To describe Fallon, and by
extension, his show, just one word
is needed: fresh. His face is fresh,
his attitude is fresh, his studio is
fresh, the way he interacts with
his audience is fresh and, hell, his
house band (The Roots) is as fresh
as it goddamn gets. For a late night
scene that has remained relatively
stagnant in recent memory, Fallon
brings a much-needed jolt of
youthful vigor.
Accordingly, Fallon channels
his technological prowess to con-
nect with the younger, hipper
crowd - a demographic that's up
to its ears in iPhones and other
digital-age doohickeys. On air, he
has framed audience members'
heads in phony Facebook profiles,
asked celebrity guests questions
he received from fans via Twit-
ter and started a segment called
"Online Video of the Week."
Fallon unquestionably owns the
title of late night techie. (Big
money says Jay Leno can't even
send an e-mail.)
And that's not the only ele-
ment differentiating Fallon's
"Late Night" from his compe-
tition. He's obsessed with get-

ting people to share in his fun,
whether that entails challenging
celebrity guests like Cameron
Diaz to dance-offs, coaxing audi-
ence members to lick random
objects (like lawnmowers) for $10
or picking one lucky person from
the peanut gallery to serenade Jon
Bon Jovi.
The name of Fallon's game is
participation - everyone from the
guest's chair to the cheap seats
must feel the love. His interactive
intent is even perceptible in the
setup he uses for musical guests'
performances: Audience mem-
bers can shuffle onto two porches
overlooking the stage, where they
can tap, clap or dance along with
the action below.
Still, praising Fallon so early
might seem odd to some - his pal-
pable rawness and inexperience
can't be easily overlooked and
his magnetic boyish charm isn't
An unexpected
rising star of
late-night talk.
enough tonullifyall hisshortcom-
ings. It's true that Fallonrarelyhits
one out of the park during opening
monologues, despite all his years
of "SNL Weekend Update" expe-
rience. It's also true that Fallon's
interviewing skills aren't yet up
to par - his first interview fell
just short of a train wreck (though
that's partially Robert De Niro's
fault, who is an abysmal intervie-
wee). But it's hard to fault Fallon
for not being perfect right out of
the gate. In fact, it's almost better
that he's not.
In times when Americans pre-
fer to knock back culture as a
shot rather than slowly relishing
it like a fine wine, it's easy to dis-
miss Fallon because he has a lot to
learn as a host. It's also easy, for
the same reason, to fly into the
open arms of one of Fallon's more
proven competitors, like Craig
Ferguson or Jimmy Kimmel. Yet
sticking with Fallon in his earliest
of days promises to afford quite a
view; here is a man coming into
his own; here is the next big thing.
Here is the genesis of Jimmy
Fallon. Now that's something you
don't see every night.

Wolverines head south seeking NCAA glory

Championships will
showcase Blue's top
individual efforts
By ROGER SAUERHAFT
Daily Sports Writer
Despite 32 years of coaching
track and field, Michigan coach
Fred LaPlante doesn't pretend to
have a standard training plan for
this time of year.
LaPlante is preparing athletes
for the NCAA Indoor Champion-
ships, but after months of heavy
training, he said it's extremely dif-
ficult to draw the line between too
much and too little exercise.
Seniors Adam Harris and Justin
Switzer and redshirt junior Sean
Pruitt are preparing for this week-
end's trip to the NCAA Indoor
Championships in College Station,
Texas.
"It's different for each guy,"
LaPlante said. "It's a psychological
thing. It's an art of having a guy
fresh for the race. It's how much
can you do where they still have
confidence, but they're not doing
so much that they're exhausted."
ADAM HARRIS: 60-METER DASH
LaPlante emphasized how
important it was for Harris to
stay mentally fresh at the Big Ten
Championships, where he won the
60-meter (6.62) and 200-meter
(20.99) dashes to cap off his late-
season surge.
Itwas asharpcontrasttohispre-
vious meet at the Nebraska Husker
Invitational. In the 60-meter dash,
the event he is running at nation-
als, Harris ran a time of 6.76 sec-
onds.
"At Nebraska, his mind was
so'mewhere else," LaPlante said.

"But at the Big Ten meet, you knew
it was going to be a long day for
everyone else, because he was in
that zone, and if you were going to
beat him, it was going to be pretty
unbelievable."
But LaPlante could tell well
before the Big Ten meet that Har-
ris would be successful. Harris
was named Big Ten Track Athlete
of the Year and Track Athlete of
the Championships.
"You could just sense it from
about 10 days out from how he
was approaching his business,"
LaPlante said. "I just couldn't see
him getting denied at the Big Ten
meet. He was just focused and
wasn't uptight, either."
LaPlante said he also sees the
same focus in Harris for the NCAA
meet. It also helps that Harris has
been at this stage before, finishing
fourth (6.62 seconds) in last year's
national meet to claim his first All-
American honor.
"When the lights go on, Adam
always knows what to do," LaPlan-
te said. "He can get focused the
right way. He doesn't get overly up
or down."
Harris said that with his linger-
ing lower back problems mostly
cleared up and off his mind, he's
readyto unleash his speed in away
that he hasn't often done this year.
Although Clemson sophomore
Jacoby Ford holds the nation's top
time at 6.51 seconds, Harris said
winning a national championship
from the fifth seed was a possibil-
ity.
JUSTIN SWITZER: MILE RUN
Fellow senior Justin Switzer
also goes to the NCAA Champion-
ship meet to top off his decorated
career on the indoor track.
Switzer qualified for the NCAA
meet as a sophomore, where he

'took All-American honors in the
distance medley relay and won the
conference title in the 1,500-meter
run. According to distance coach
Ron Warhurst, Switzer's meet two
years ago was mostly a learning
experience. Warhurst said this
time around, Switzer has a differ-
ent game plan going into College
Station.
"He's got to be able to put him-
self in position where he can use
his speed," Warhurst said. "Every-
body is going to be quick. Every-
one will be fast. It's the national
championship."
Switzer just won the Big Ten
title in the mile run two weeks ago
and has changed up his normal
routine of running 65 miles per
week. He's now running just 42
miles per week as he tries to stay
fresh before facing the nation's top
runners.
"It's all mental. You have a men-
tal approach and a plan and you
have to execute it," said Warhurst,
adding that Switzer plans to keep
pace with the front four runners
going into the final stretch. "I
have no question he's got the con-
fidence. It's about executing the
plan we have."
Switzer's 3:58.86 mile time, run
on Feb. 6, makes him the eighth
seed of 14 runners. He is just a
second and a half behind the top
seed, Michigan State junior Shane
Knoll.
SEAN PRUITT: WEIGHT THROW
Redshirt junior thrower Sean
Pruitt will be making the trek to
College Station to participate in
the weight throw.
Pruitthas neverbefore qualified
for the NCAA Championships but
has enjoyed a spectacular indoor
season, headlined by breaking
his own Michigan record in the

A rivalry is about to be
revived.
When legendary coach Newt
Loken first re-established the
men's gymnastics program at
Michigan, the team's biggest foe
was powerhouse Illinois.
For years - 11
in a row from IllinoiS at
1950-60, to be
exact - the Wol- Michigan
verines watched Matchup:
as the Fighting lllinois 10-5;
Illini grabbed Michigan 10-4

they wanted so Saturday
badly. 7 P.M.
In recent sea- Where: Clffl
sons, the Illini Keen Arena

backseat to mgoblue.com
bigger-name
opponents like
Oklahoma and Ohio State.
But now, No. 5 Michigan and
No. 4 Illinois are the top two
teams in the Big Ten. And it's
Senior Night.
Outside of the postseason com-
petitions, there are few meets
the Wolverines want to win more
than this Saturday's.
The Illini have just two Big
Ten losses so far this season, and
both of them came courtesy of the
Wolverines. In Michigan's last
meet, the Feb. 21 Pacific Coast
Classic, it beat Illinois by nearly
five points.
"That gives us a pretty good
edge of confidence going into the
meet," said sophomore Ben Bal-
dus-Strauss, who will compete
on the floor, pommel horse, vault
and high bar.
"(But the Illini) have so much
raw talent. We definitely can't go
in there thinking that we're bet-
ter than them. We just have to
prove it."
For Michigan, it will be the
first challenging dual meet with
another Big Ten team since a nar-
row loss to Penn State on Jan.
24. The competition will be the
last at Cliff Keen Arena for most
of Michigan's seniors. All seven
of the healthy seniors are in the
starting lineup.
"They've been the leaders
since I got here," Baldus-Strauss
said. "It's going to be sad, because
we're going to lose so many of


ht features
een elite
squads
them. We definitely want to come
out with a victory for their last
meet at Keen and send them off
in style."
The Illini won't make it easy,
and neither will injuries. While
Michigan just lost freshman
Syque Caesar - who has been a
major contributor all year - to
a torn meniscus, Illinois just
regained the services of star
sophomore Paul Ruggeri, who
is coming back from the same
injury.
The duo of Ruggeri and fellow
sophomore Daniel Ribeiro can
add full points to Illinois' team
total, not just tenths. When he
hits, Ribeiro almost singlehand-
edly carries the pommel horse
squad.
And last weekend, the Illini
put up their biggest score of the
season at home on their Senior
Night.
It remains to be seen if they'll
get the same big numbers in Ann
Arbor, but the Wolverines still
aren't taking them lightly.
"They can come from not hit-
ting too many meets all season to
just nailing their sets by the end
of the season," Baldus-Strauss
said. "They really have that
worked out very well. You can
never count them out."
And with Caesar out of the
lineup, Michigan's hit percentage
will be that much more impor-
tant.
During their off weeks, the
Wolverines focused on improv-
ing their pommel horse routines
after they had to count two falls
on the event at the Pacific Coast
Classic on Feb. 21.
On Wednesday, the Wolver-
ines held a 12-man pommel horse
intrasquad, with seniors Ralph
Rosso and Ryan McCarthy lead-
ing teams of six.
The winning team wasn't the
one with the best score but the
most hits.
The gymnasts also empha-
sized perfection work, trying to
minimize all possible deductions
in their routines.
They don't want a repeat of
last year's meet in Champaign,
where despite a decent showing,
the Wolverines fell just short of a
win.
"Itwasn't like we had the worst
meet there, and we didn't do
extremely well." Baldus-Strauss
said.
"We just couldn't keep up with
the scoring. Hopefully this year
we'll be a little more even. And on
our home turf, hopefully that'll
help things out. We'll have every-
one behind us."

Wolverines see Broncos and beyond

By NICOLE AUERBACH
Daily Sports Editor
The Michigan hockey team's
road to Joe Louis Arena is clear.
Well, there's a minor roadblock
- this weekend's series against
Western Michi-
gan, a team that Westem
finished seventh
in the CCHA Michigan at

cos finished the Matchup:

forward Patrick
Galivan, who led
the CCHA in points. Not to mention
that Western Michigan goalie Riley
Gill has been hot of late, making 33
saves in a 2-1 upset win over Michi-
gan on Nov. 14 at Yost Ice.Arena.
OK, maybe the Broncos aren't
such a minor obstacle. And Wolver-
ine coach Red Berenson is making
sure his team realizes that.
"Coach was telling us (Wednes-
day), there's no limo waiting to take
us to the Joe," sophomore center
Louie Caporusso said. "We defi-

nitely can't get ahead of ourselves.
We got to make sure we take one
step at a time and understand that
we have a challenge ahead of us."
And at least for the past week,
Michigan has focused all its atten-
tion on its opponent. Last week's
practices seemed more relaxed, as
the Wolverines coasted through
their bye weekend and watched the
Broncos beat the Lakers.
"You work hard all year to get
a bye and to get home ice, and you
have to take advantage of it," Beren-
son said. "I knew last week that we
would play a good team this week,
a team with some confidence and
some momentum. It didn't matter
if it was Nebraska-Omaha or in this
case, Western. What's important
really is the focus."
Because of that extra weekend
off, Michigan must not show any
rust. Teams generally don't like to
take breaks when they're playing
well, and the Wolverines are no
exception. After closing the regu-
lar season on a 17-3 run, they admit
they didn't really need a breather.
The mini-break did help a few
players, including senior defense-
man Mark Mitera. Mitera, who
sustained a torn anterior cruciate
ligament in the season opener on
Oct. 10, returned to action on Feb.
27 in Michigan's final series of the
regular season against Ferris State.
He played in both games of that
weekend's series, and after another
two weeks of full-contact practice,
he expects to be more confident.
Confidence could be crucial in

this weekend's series with Western
Michigan (9-13-6-2 CCHA, 14-18-7 "
overall). The Broncos come into the
matchup with a pair of playoff wins
under their belt as well as momen-
tum,thanksto acome-from-behind
series win.
Michigan (20-8-0-0, 26-10-0),
on the other hand, hasn't yet faced
a do-or-die situation. And the Wol-
verines haven't played in an over-
time period that would decide the
fate of their season.
"I thinkthe changed part is now
you're in the second round of the
playoffs," Berenson said. "You're
playing against a team that's
already played three games, and
they'll have that momentum and
that playoff mode in their game.
We've got to get it in ours."
And while the Wolverines cau-
tiously say they are staying focused
on the Broncos, Berenson can'thelp
but look ahead just a little.
"Ithinkitspartofourgoalsevery
year to do as well as we can in the
league, in the playoffs to get the
bye, to get to Joe Louis, to get to the
championship game, have a chance
at winning the CCHA tournament,
getting into the NCAA tournament
and so on," Berenson said.
"It's an expectation. We've been
.fortunate. Every year that you get
there, you have to earn it. You have
to play well enough to end anoth-
er team's season. For quite a few
years, we have. But every year's a
different year. Right now, we're
focused on this weekend, but it's a
big weekend."
