ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

As Michigan gears up for the 
March 10 Democratic primary, 
University of Michigan students 
are comparing the positions 
of front-runners former Vice 
President Joe Biden and Sen. 
Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. on issues 
relating to higher education. 
Affordability 
of 
four-year 
colleges 
and 
universities 

has been an important topic 
throughout 
the 
primary. 
Both 
candidates’ 
platforms 
include measures to increase 
affordability and reduce student 
loan debt, focusing heavily on 
the expansion of Pell grants, 
a federal subsidy provided to 
students 
from 
low-income 
families. 
According 
to 
Biden’s 
published positions on higher 
education, Biden thinks college 
should be used as a pathway 
for people to move into the 

middle class. To make college 
more affordable, he promises 
to double the maximum value 
of Pell grants in order to 
offer additional financial aid 
specifically towards low-income 
and middle-class students. 
Biden’s platform also says 
he 
wants 
to 
further 
loan 
forgiveness for people working 
in public service and continue 
programs such as the Public 
Service 
Loan 
Forgiveness 
program, which forgives debt 
to students entering public-

service related careers. His 
platform 
also 
discusses 
promoting 
an 
income-based 
student loan repayment plan 
and protecting GI benefits for 
veterans and their families. 
LSA 
freshman 
Andrew 
Schaeffler, 
co-founder 
of 
Students for Biden at U-M, 
believes Biden’s policies on 
increasing Pell Grants would 
directly 
impact 
University 
students by increasing access to 
education.

With 
the 
2020 
election 
approaching, 
United 
States 
immigrants 
and 
naturalized 
citizens make up one-tenth of 
eligible voters in the United 
States. The number of U.S. 
immigrants 
and 
naturalized 
citizens eligible to vote has 
grown by 93 percent since the 
year 2000, making about 23 
million 
immigrants 
eligible 
to vote. However, more than 
5 million of those immigrants 
have 
Limited 
English 
Proficiency, making it more 
difficult for them to vote since 
ballots are often written only in 
English. 
Carolyn Chen, LSA junior and 
field director for the University 
of Michigan chapter of College 
Democrats, spoke to The Daily 
about the issue of English-only 
ballots for those with LEP. 
“English-only ballots are an 
issue because without having 
multiple languages, there is 
covert disenfranchisement by 
pushing away underrepresented 
minorities from the polls,” Chen 
said. “If people are not able to 
understand a ballot, they are 
unable to vote.”

Bernie Sanders, the Vermont 
senator hoping to win the 
Democratic 
presidential 
nomination, 
has 
made 
an 
extensive effort to reach out 
to 
the 
Muslim 
community, 
garnering large support. Arab 
American and Muslim groups on 
various social media platforms 
use

#InshallahBernie to show their 
support. Many in the Muslim 
community 
have 
taken 
to 
referring to Sanders as “Amo 
Bernie,” 
meaning 
“Uncle 
Bernie.”
At 
a 
campaign 
event 
in 
Dearborn on Saturday, Sanders 
addressed 
members 
of 
the 
area’s 
large 
Arab 
American 
and Muslim communities. He 
discussed the need to focus on 
what unifies people, rather than 
what divides them.
“Every person in this room, it 
doesn’t matter if you’re Christian, 
Muslim, Jewish, whatever you 
may be, you have the same 
dreams 
and 
aspirations,” 
Sanders said on Saturday. “Last 
I heard, everyone needs health 
care as a human right. Last I 
heard, everyone wants their kids 
to get a quality education.”

Whitmer, Booker and Harris support 
presidential hopeful at Michigan rally

Cheers of “Let’s go, Joe” filled 
the gym of Renaissance High 
School in Detroit on Monday 
night, the eve of the Democratic 
primary, as supporters gathered to 
rally for presidential hopeful Joe 
Biden. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Cal., 
Sen. Cory Booker, D-NJ, and Gov. 
Gretchen Whitmer joined Biden 
on the stage in a final push for his 
election before Tuesday. 
Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan 
opened the rally in support of 
Biden, referencing the former 
vice president’s commitment to 
helping rebuild Detroit’s economy 
following its 2014 bankruptcy. 
“He got us new buses, he got 
us housing ... When the rest of the 
country had written us off, he was 
there,” Duggan said. 
Lt. 
Gov. 
Garlin 
Gilchrist 
explained his support for Biden 
using three factors: his record, 
his results and his relationships. 
Gilchrist said he voted for Sen. 
Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., in 2016, 
receiving a mixed response from 
the crowd, but explained he 
believes these three qualities set 

Biden apart. 
“The 
difference 
is 
nobody 
with the records, results and 
relationships of Joe Biden was on 
the ballot and what we need in 
2020 is somebody who is gonna 
have a vision that includes all of 
us,” Gilchrist said. “When Joe 
Biden looks to build a coalition, 
he doesn’t look away from any 
person, he doesn’t look away from 
any community, instead, he looks 
to empower people to help make a 
difference.”
Biden’s record resonated with 
some 
University 
of 
Michigan 
students in attendance as well, 
including 
Information 
junior 
Harrison McCabe, who said he 
finds Biden the most trustworthy 
of 
the 
remaining 
Democratic 
candidates. 
“I trust Joe,” McCabe said. “He 
has a record of getting things done, 
and he’s the most ‘get-it-done’ 
person left in this race.”
LSA freshman Kenny Larson, 
who is involved with Students for 
Biden at the University, said he felt 
a sense of coalition while waiting 
in line for the doors to open to the 
rally.
“Just based on what we’ve seen 
walking through here, this rally 

reflects a really diverse coalition of 
voters, whether that be across age, 
race, ethnicity, sexuality,” Larson 
said. “I think that really speaks 
to sort of Joe Biden’s message of 
unity.”
Whitmer spoke to this coalition 
in her speech in support of Biden, 
pointing to the diversity of the 
crowd.
“What I love about Joe Biden, 
though, is he knows how to 
build a coalition,” Whitmer 
said. “I’m ridin’ with Biden and 
everyone else has a seat too. It 
takes coalitions to win. And 
this campaign looks like this 
country and it looks like this 
city.”
LSA 
freshman 
Adam 
Grimes, who is a member 
of Students for Biden and 
attended Sunday’s rally for 
Sanders, felt that the crowd 
at the Biden rally was more 
diverse and indicative of a 
stronger coalition to beat 
Trump. 
He 
pointed 
to 
Biden’s victories in Southern 
states as evidence of his 
ability to turn key states 
democratic. 

See EDUCATION, Page 3

See SANDERS, Page 3
See LANGUAGE, Page 3

“Bernie’s 
crowd 
yesterday 
actually made me a little bit nervous,” 
Grimes said. “It was just the same 
young, generally white voters that 
he’s been getting and that’s not 
what’s gonna win the election against 
Trump.” 
Booker mentioned this sense of 
unity while also appealing to Detroit 
natives, speaking about his mother’s 
roots in Detroit and his grandfather 
being a United Auto Workers 
assembly line worker.
“This party is not the party of ‘me,’ 
it’s the party of ‘we,’” Booker said. 
“It’s the party that believes in this 
radical concept — I don’t know if y’all 
ever heard of it — it’s called science.”
Booker 
listed 
other 
issues 
important to the Democratic party 
as well, such as civil rights, voting 
rights, women’s rights and worker’s 
rights. Harris, taking the stage after 
Booker, spoke more to some of these 
central party issues.
“Michigan: Justice is on the ballot 
in 2020,” Harris said. “Economic 
justice is on the ballot in 2020. 
Reproductive justice is on the ballot 
in 2020. Healthcare justice is on the 
ballot in 2020, environmental justice 
is on the ballot in 2020, racial justice 
is on the ballot in 2020, 
and Joe Biden is on the 

ballot in 2020.”
Biden came out after Kamala’s 
introduction, thanking those who 
spoke before him. He specifically 
thanked Whitmer, citing one of her 
campaign’s catchphrases.
“When I hear that great line you 
say, ‘Let’s fix the damn roads’ — let’s 
fix this country,” Biden said. 
He began his speech by talking 
about how just over a week ago, the 
press and Congress had declared 
the campaign “dead,” a ruling that, 
according to Biden, was overturned 
by South Carolina and Super Tuesday 
primary results. 
A 
few 
minutes 
into 
his 
speech, 
Biden 
was interrupted by Anti-NAFTA 

protesters, who had large banners 
and began chanting. Biden responded 
with, “This is not a Trump rally,” 
telling people in the crowd to let the 
protesters go. The protesters were 
quickly escorted outside, after which 
the crowd resumed chants of “Let’s 
go, Joe.” 
Soon after, about 25 protesters 
from Sunrise Movement, a climate 
activist group that endorses Sanders, 
and 
Black 
Youth 
Project 
100 
(BYP100), a Black youth organization 
dedicated to social justice issues, 
disrupted the rally with the chant 
“Joe must go.” They carried banners 
reading “Green New Deal Now” and 
“Green Jobs For All” as they marched 
and chanted. 
Allie Lindstrom, midwest trainer 
and co-founder Sunrise Ann Arbor 
Hub, said they hoped to interrupt the 
rally and ask Biden questions about 
his ability to appeal to youth voters. 
“My intention was to call attention 
to the fact that Joe Biden does not 
have widespread youth support and 
many of the policies that excite young 
people and excite new voters — he 
has not spoken (about), he has not 
committed to any change, and we

Engineering and Nursing students discuss 
losing credits after cross-campus transfer

Those changing schools within the University often have to take additional semesters

KRISTINA ZHENG
Daily Staff Reporter

University 
of 
Michigan 
students 
transferring 
between schools or colleges 
on the Ann Arbor campus 
struggle 
to 
bring 
their 
credits with them, leading 
many to take on additional 
semesters 
to 
fulfill 
distribution requirements.
Carmela Brown, associate 
director 
of 
the 
Newnan 
Academic Advising Center, 
detailed 
the 
policies 
for 
students undergoing cross-
campus transfer. Regardless 
of the school or college, 
students are required to 
fulfill 
the 
requirements 
implemented by the school 
or college they transfer into, 
Brown explained in an email 
to The Daily. 
“Each 
academic 
undergraduate 
unit 
determines the requirements 
and policies to uphold the 
integrity of their degree,” 
Brown 
wrote. 
“When 
a 
student moves from one 
unit to another through a 
cross-campus transfer, the 
student is required to follow 
the 
policies 
determined 
by the unit which could be 
different for each school or 
college.”
According to Brown, in the 
Fall 2019 and Winter 2020 
semesters, 
approximately 
120 
students 
transferred 
cross-campus to LSA. Most 
of these students had a 
minimum of 30 credits when 
they transferred since most 
remained in their original 
school or college for a year, 
Brown explained.
LSA 
sophomore 
Tess 
Eschebach transferred from 
the College of Engineering 
to LSA at the end of last 

semester. 
Eschebach 
told 
The Daily her decision to 
transfer to LSA was due to 
the School of Engineering’s 
highly technical curriculum.
“I 
didn’t 
want 
to 
be 
doing technical stuff full-
time,” Eschebach said. “The 
College of Engineering is 
structured in such a way that 
even with flexible technical 
electives that they have in 
the EECS department, it’s 
like you’re still taking all 
technical classes with little 
time to take any humanities. 
I wasn’t really vibing with 
that.”
Engineering 
students 
often take the same courses 
during their first two years, 
including LSA courses like 
Math 115, Chemistry 130 and 
Physics 140 and Engineering 
courses 
like 
Engineering 
100, among others. Many of 
these courses do not transfer 
to 
fulfill 
distribution 
requirements 
in 
LSA, 
according to Eschebach.
“In 
the 
College 
of 
Engineering, your schedule 
is 
basically 
planned 
out 
for you, like from day one,” 
Eschebach said. “I remember 
I was super stressed this 
semester because I could 
take anything. And I was like 
that is so stressful because, 
in Engineering, you literally 
come into Engineering with 
your first years planned 
out. And once your major 
is declared, your next two 
years are planned out … 
And none of that stuff really 
directly translates to LSA 
credit, so I guess that could 
be a big problem as well.”
Brown said Engineering 
students 
generally 
enroll 
in LSA classes in their first 
year to fulfill Engineering 
requirements. Other courses 

taken through the School 
of Engineering would be 
considered non-LSA credits, 
only 20 of which would count 
towards an LSA degree.
“Engineering 
students 
are 
usually 
taking 
LSA 
classes in their first year as 
part of their Engineering 
requirements such as math, 
physics 
and 
chemistry,” 
Brown wrote. “Therefore, 
they usually have not maxed 
out of the non-LSA credits. 
The College does recognize 
the degree requirements and 
competencies required of all 
LSA students which include 
the students who transfer to 
LSA.”
Likewise, 
transferring 
into the School of Nursing 
from LSA requires a set 
of 
prerequisite 
courses 
students must take before 
applying, including English 
125, 
Psychology 
111 
and 
Biological Chemistry 212, 
among others. If students 
choose 
to 
take 
courses 
outside of these prerequisites 
in LSA, the credits earned do 
not transfer to the Nursing 
School.
Nursing sophomore Alissa 
Elanjian 
transferred 
to 
the Nursing School after 
her freshman year in LSA. 
Elanjian 
knew 
from 
the 
start of her freshman year 
she would be applying to the 
Nursing 
School, 
allowing 
her to tailor her LSA courses.
“The Nursing School only 
accepted 30 to 35 transfer 
(students), so I did not have 
a very high chance of getting 
in,” Elanjian said. “So I did 
take a big risk by applying 
because all of my classes in 
freshman year were focused 
towards the Nursing School. 
So if I did not get into the 
Nursing School, the only 

classes that would make 
sense were the Stats 250 that 
I took in LSA and the English 
course I took in LSA.”
Another 
concern 
for 
students transferring from 
the College of Engineering 
is that many of the credits 
they’ve 
accumulated 
through 
Advanced Placement or dual 
enrollment 
credits 
only 
count toward Engineering 
distribution 
requirements. 
They do not apply to LSA 
distribution 
requirements, 
Eschebach explained.
“For 
my 
humanities 
distribution, I was able to 
knock most of it out with AP 
credit, but in LSA, it doesn’t 
count,” Eschebach said. “So, 
like, that’s a difference that 
I know no LSA students are 
getting that credit, but it’s 
really kind of jarring moving 
from Engineering, where it 
was fulfilling distribution 
requirements, and now it’s 
not. And now, I’m stuck in a 
lot of 100 level courses.”
As 
an 
Engineering 
student, Eschebach would 
have been able to graduate 
in three years with her AP 
credits and dual enrollment 
transfer credits. Now in 
LSA, she will most likely 
graduate in five years.
“I’m going to be here a 
while,” Eschebach said. “I 
was just continually pushed 
into doing Engineering, so I 
never really thought about 
doing anything else … it’s 
been a lot exploring for me, 
a lot of confusion in what I 
want to do … I’m sure I’ll 
have extra time just because 
of distribution as well.”

BIDEN 
From Page 1

He also said Biden’s plan for 
loan forgiveness would affect 
many students, especially those 
hoping to work in public service. 
“I think on a broader scale, 
just having a president that’s 
focused on these things (is 
important),” Schaeffler said. 
“Having 
a 
president 
that 
will appoint a secretary of 
education that has been on 
the front line … will do a lot in 
terms of having our concerns 
heard.” 
Sanders’ plan to increase 
affordability 
promises 
to 
guarantee 
tuition-free 
and 
debt-free 
public 
colleges, 
universities and trade schools, 
as well as to cancel all student 
loan debt, expand the Pell grant 
program and triple funding for 
work-study programs.
Porter 
Hughes, 
LSA 
freshman and co-founder of 
Students for Bernie 2020 at 
the University, views Sanders’ 
plans as a way to increase 
the amount of middle- and 
working-class people who are 
pursuing higher education. He 
said he thinks it would increase 
the amount of diversity on 
campus. 
“Cost is a huge barrier in 
terms of access to higher 
education 
and 
Bernie 
has 
the best plan going forward 

to completely eliminate that 
barrier,” Hughes said. “I feel 
like we would see much more 
diversity in terms of racial 
and 
ethnic 
diversity 
and 
socioeconomic diversity at the 
University of Michigan if this 
policy was in place.” 
According to the University’s 
Office of Diversity, Equity & 
Inclusion, 65 percent of current 
students identify as Caucasian. 
15 percent identify as Asian 
American while a combined 
12 percent identify as African 
American, Hispanic and Native 
American, with the other 10 
percent being other/unknown. 
U.S. News reported that 19 
percent of undergraduates at 
U-M Ann Arbor are receiving 
Pell Grants, with the number 
being closer to 39 percent at 
U-M Flint.
LSA 
sophomore 
Hazel 
Gordon said Sanders’ goal to 
make four-year colleges and 
universities affordable is the 
main reason she supports him. 
Gordon said she has witnessed 
how the University community 
is affected by Ann Arbor’s 
cost of living and the burdens 
of debt on college graduates 
and believes Sanders’ plan 
would alleviate the burden 
on 
students 
with 
lower 
socioeconomic statuses.
“I have a lot of friends who 
are only able to go to Michigan 
on financial aid,” Gordon said. 
“When it comes to paying rent 

in Ann Arbor and being able to 
afford food, it’s not easy. Most 
people in my generation can’t 
buy a house or have kids … 
because (of) debt.”
According 
to 
President 
Donald 
Trump’s 
campaign 
website, Trump has prioritized 
the expansion of the Pell Grant 
program by distributing the 
grants 
year-around 
rather 
than just in the fall and 
spring semesters. He has also 
publicized the changes made 
to the Federal Student Aid 
processes and says the process 
is now easier to navigate, has 
better customer service and is 
more accessible to students. 
During his time as President, 
Trump has discussed making 
funding for higher education 
more accessible but has also 
worked to cut Federal Student 
Loan funding by imposing 
caps on the number of loans 
students 
can 
receive 
for 
higher education. The Trump 
administration 
has 
reduced 
programs 
allowing 
parents 
to take out loans for a child’s 
education and wants to end 
the 
Public 
Service 
Loan 
Forgiveness program. Trump 
has also promoted for-profit 
colleges and has ended Obama-
era 
regulations 
on 
these 
institutions, making it easier 
for them to receive federal 
funds.
Nick Schuler, LSA freshman 
and freshman chair of the 

University’s chapter of College 
Republicans, 
discussed 
Trump’s 
work 
on 
higher 
education, saying he believed 
the president wants to help 
students afford college. 
“The president believes in 
the power of higher education,” 
Schuler said. “That being said, 
he and College Republicans 
believe students should pursue 
whatever 
post-high 
school 
education/training/work 
is best for them. Not every 
student is the same, so not 
every student should follow 
the same path.” 
Schuler 
also 
commented 
on the positions of Sanders 
and Biden, saying he did not 
believe their positions would 
help students. 
“The 
radical 
Democrats 
can offer free this and free 
that, 
the 
American 
people 
know better,” Schuler said. 
“If you work hard and save for 
college, you don’t need free 
college. The government and 
private 
institutions 
provide 
many tools to pursue higher 
education. 
Some 
3 
billion 
dollars of scholarship money 
goes unclaimed. It doesn’t 
make sense to tax ourselves 
into poverty in order to provide 
free higher education if there 
is 3 billion floating around.” 
Funding for Historically 
Black 
Colleges 
and 
Universities 
and 
other 
minority-serving 
institutions
The two candidates have 
also discussed the role of 
Historically 
Black 
Colleges 
and Universities and other 
minority-serving institutions. 
Biden 
promises 
to 
make 
attendance at these institutions 
more affordable by increasing 
investments 
and 
improving 
their infrastructure, making 
them more competitive among 
other four-year colleges and 
universities.
Schaeffler 
said 
he 
was 
supportive of Biden’s efforts 
to bring attention to HBCUs 
and 
other 
minority-serving 
institutions.
“Being able to put funds 
and attention to those types 
of institutions will not only 
improve 
them 
but 
bring 
that recognition to them,” 
Schaeffler 
said. 
“At 
the 
moment, there are funding 
disparities 
among 
public 
institutions and those, so I 
think that’s another problem 
that would be remedied or 
close 
to 
remedied 
under 
Biden’s plan.”
Sanders has also said he 
would support HBCUs and 
minority-serving institutions, 
saying 
he 
will 
give 
$1.3 
billion in federal funding to 
support about 200 schools. 
Hughes said he thinks funding 
for 
HBCUs 
and 
minority-
serving institutions will help 
more students attain higher 

education and provide them 
with more opportunities.
“It is important that we 
close 
the 
racial 
equality 
gap,” Hughes said. “Not only 
in general but in education. 
There’s a really big equality 
gap and achievement gap, and 
we want to be able to close 
that by funding institutions 
that help minority students, 
(especially those) who might 
otherwise not receive the help 
… (or) the same opportunities.”
In Dec. 2019, Trump signed 
a bill to provide $250 million 
per year for HBCUs and other 
minority-serving institutions. 
The bill was supported by 
members 
of 
both 
major 
political parties. 
Schuler said he believed 
the increase in funding would 
be good for the institutions 
receiving it and compared the 
president’s actions to those of 
Democratic leaders. 
“It will guarantee those 
institutions have the resources 
to provide a good education for 
their students,” Schuler said. 
“The president is a fighter for 
all students, something the 
Democrats aren’t. While I am 
not a student at a Black college, 
I would be ecstatic knowing 
the quality of my education will 
be maintained and expanded 
under the president.”
Trade 
schools 
and 
community colleges
Under 
Sanders’ 
policies, 
trade schools and community 
colleges would fall underneath 
his College for All Act, which 
will allocate at least $48 billion 
per year to eliminate all tuition 
and fees, essentially making 
higher education free for all.
A supporter of the College 
for All Act, Hughes said he 
is excited that all forms of 
education will be included in 
the act.
“I 
think 
(trade 
schools 
and 
community 
colleges) 
are equally valuable routes 
of education as a four-year 
university,” Hughes said. “it’s 
important that we fund all 
forms of education.” 
Biden hopes to provide two 
years of free community college 
or other training programs, 
create a new grant program 
to help community colleges 
support students and expand 
financial aid to be applied 
to expenses beyond tuition 
and fees. Biden also plans on 
a $50 billion investment in 
workforce training.
By bringing attention to 
community colleges and their 
needs, Schaeffler said Biden is 
taking a positive step towards 
removing the stigma around 
community colleges and trade 
schools. 
“I think (community college) 
is 
extremely 
important, 
especially for my high school,” 
Schaeffler said. “In an area 
like mine, where (for) a lot 

of students, it was almost 
expected that we were to go 
to a four-year university as 
opposed to a trade school or 
a community college. I think 
that 
by 
publicizing 
(going 
to a community college), it 
normalizes that.”
Funding educational plans
Sanders says he will fund 
his 
educational 
plans 
by 
placing a tax on Wall Street 
transactions. The tax includes 
a 0.5 percent tax on stock 
trades, a 0.1 percent fee on bond 
trades and a 0.005 percent 
fee on derivative trades. This 
speculation tax aims to raise 
$2.4 trillion in 10 years.
Hughes said placing this 
tax on Wall Street is justified 
and will help pay for student 
education.
“I 
think 
this 
is 
really 
important because it provides 
adequate 
funding,” 
Hughes 
said. “It also keeps a check and 
regulation on the same people 
who destroyed our economy 
back in the 2008 financial 
crisis.” 

According to Forbes, Biden 
will pay for his plans by 
capping itemized deductions at 
28 percent and “eliminat(ing) 
the practice of stepped-up tax 
basis.”
The 
Tax 
Foundation 
describes the step-up basis 
as “when a person leaves 
property to an heir, the cost 
basis of the bequeathed asset 
receives a ‘step-up’ in basis to 
its fair market value at the time 
of the original owner’s death.” 
In other words, people must 
pay taxes on their investments 
based on value on the date the 
investment was made and the 
value when sold. Should the 
person die and transfer their 
investments to their heirs, the 
value of when the investment 
was made becomes that of the 
current market price. Biden 
would change the current tax 
law to avoid this loophole. 
Schaeffler said one of the 
main 
reasons 
he 
supports 
Biden is because he believes 
Biden’s proposed methods are 
realistic and achievable — he 
said he thinks Sanders’ plans 
are unachievable.
“When 
you 
look 
at 
something like free college 
for all, eliminating all student 
loan debt, on the surface, that 
sounds amazing,” Schaeffler 
said. “Without a clear way of 
paying for it and a clear way for 
that to pass through the United 
States Senate and United States 
House of Representatives, at 
that point, it’s just a plan. I 
don’t think there’s a way to 
implement it.”

According to the Los Angeles 
Times, representatives from the 
Sanders campaign said they hope 
Muslims will help him win the 
upcoming 
Michigan 
primary, 
as he did in 2016. They also 
believe the campaign’s outreach, 
which includes campaign ads in 
Arabic, to the Arab American 
and Muslim communities would 
be a relevant factor if he wins. 
Sanders’s campaign released a 
digital ad on Sunday highlighting 
support for the senator among 
members of Michigan’s Arab 
American population.
U.S. 
Rep. 
Rashida 
Tlaib, 
D-Mich., backed Sanders early 
on, endorsing him in October 
2019. In the video announcing 
her support for Sanders, she 
cited his backing of her and 
other recently elected women 
of color. She spoke of Sanders’s 
commitment to implementing 
values they both share.
“For me, representing the 
third 
poorest 
Congressional 

district in the country, he is in 
many ways pushing back against 
this really painful oppression,” 
Tlaib said. “It’s been incredibly 
inspiring to see his unwavering 
support for the same ideals that 
I have.” 
His campaign manager Faiz 
Shakir is the first Muslim and 
Pakistani American campaign 
manager for a major political 
party 
presidential 
campaign. 
Sanders 
has 
also 
received 
endorsements from many leaders 
in the Muslim community. In 
addition to Tlaib, U.S. Rep. 
Ilhan Omar, D-Minn, endorsed 
Sanders in October. Tlaib and 
Omar are the first two Muslim 
women elected to Congress, 
both with widespread support 
from the Muslim community 
and throughout their districts. 
Tlaib is also the first woman of 
Palestinian descent to serve in 
that role.
Other 
prominent 
Arab 
American 
community 
leaders 
in Michigan have thrown their 
support 
behind 
Sanders 
in 
recent weeks. In a Feb. 27 press 
release, the Sanders campaign 
announced endorsements from 

four Michigan public officials, 
including 
state 
Rep. 
Yousef 
Rabhi, D-Ann Arbor, who has 
ties 
to 
the 
Arab 
American 
and 
Muslim 
communities, 
as well as Dearborn Heights 
Councilmember Dave Abdallah, 
a 
Lebanese 
immigrant, 
and 
Ann 
Arbor 
Councilmember 
Ali 
Ramlawi, 
D-Ward 
5, 
a 
Palestinian 
American 
whose 
father left the West Bank as a 
refugee in 1948. 
State Rep. Abdullah Hammoud, 
the first Arab American Muslim 
to represent Michigan’s 15th 
State House District, and former 
gubernatorial candidate Abdul 
El-Sayed have also joined the 
Sanders’s camp, speaking at a 
campaign rally in Dearborn on 
Saturday. 
On 
Twitter, 
Hammoud 
explained 
his 
reason 
for 
backing Sanders, saying the 
senator “not only sees Arab 
and Muslim Americans, he 
doubles down and organizes 
WITH us. There has never 
been a candidate for president 

However, Congress does have 
a law in place that attempts to 
help eligible voters with LEP. 
In 1975, Congress passed a 
provision to the Voting Rights 
Act, known as the Minority 
Language 
Provision 
that 
serves to help those with LEP. 
The provision states that for 
jurisdictions 
with 
single-
language minority groups of 
over 10,000 or constituting 
five percent of the community, 
assistance in electoral processes 
must be provided. Poll clerks 
and volunteers must provide 
voting notices, forms, ballots 
or assistance in the language 
spoken by the single-language 
minority group. 
The section of the Voting 
Rights Act sets out to help 
minority 
groups 
who 
have 
been historically discriminated 
against, 
including 
Spanish 
speakers, 
Asian 
immigrants, 
Native Americans and Alaskan 
natives. As of now, 263 cities, 

counties and jurisdictions were 
covered under the provision. 
Three townships in Michigan 
are covered by Section 203, 
including 
Colfax 
Township, 
Fennville and Hamtramck. 
There have been repeated 
problems 
nationally 
with 
jurisdictions 
failing 
to 
implement 
Section 
203. 
In 
the past five years, the U.S. 
Department 
of 
Justice 
has 
filed complaints against four 
jurisdictions 
for 
failing 
to 
implement the provision.
Natalie 
Treacy, 
third-year 
Law student and member of 
the Michigan Voting Project, 
an organization that allows law 
students to work with those 
facing legal barriers when trying 
to vote, spoke to The Daily about 
the problem with jurisdictions 
not implementing Section 203. 
“There is a push obviously 
to get lost or more amenable 
to people who don’t speak 
English voting,” Treacy said. 
“There is a law out there. It does 
say you have to have election 
materials in more than one 
language if enough people in 
your jurisdiction speak another 

language. And that’s not even 
followed in and of itself all 
the time. So I would just say 
overall, there’s also a focus just 
on getting current laws to be 
actually enforced.” 
Jacqueline 
Beaudry, 
city 
clerk of Ann Arbor, wrote 
in a statement to The Daily 
about how the Ann Arbor 
precincts which do not meet 
the requirements of Section 
203 plan to accommodate those 
whose 
second 
language 
is 
English on primary election day.
“I can tell you that Ann 
Arbor does not meet the 
federal 
requirements 
for 
ballots in other languages,” 
Beaudry said. “Most of our 
ESL 
speakers 
are 
fluent, 
despite English not being the 
first language. However, we 
do have a list within City Hall 
of translators when needed, 
and our northeast precinct, 
which has the City’s largest 
concentration 
of 
Chinese 
speakers, 
has 
a 
precinct 
chairperson 
who 
speaks

wanted to highlight that ahead of 
the primary,” Lindstrom said. 
However, police escorted the 
group out quickly after their 
disruption 
began. 
Lindstrom 
said the crowd also ripped up 
protesters’ posters and shoved 
them. 
Biden 
responded 
that 
the 

disruptions are indicative of the 
tension of contemporary political 
climate. 
“This is what’s wrong with 
American politics,” Biden said. 
“I’m not going to worry — this 
is a reflection of the world of 
American politics today.”
He went on to talk about some 
of his campaign’s goals regarding 
health, 
such 
as 
accessible 
healthcare, lowering drug prices 
and protecting rural hospitals.

Biden also spoke about his role 
in the Paris Agreement, saying 
he will have the U.S. rejoin the 
agreement “first thing” on day one 
of his presidency.
“We have to up the ante,” Biden 
said. “We’re 15 percent of the 
world’s problem and we will get 
to natural emission. But, the rest 
of the world, if they don’t, it won’t 
matter.”
He also talked about his plans 
for teachers and public education, 

emphasizing 
the 
importance 
of raising teachers’ salaries in 
order to make quality education 
accessible to all regardless of their 
zip code.
As a political science major, 
Larson said he hoped to hear 
Biden expand upon his stance on 
foreign policy at the rally. 
“It’s something that I’m very 
passionate about, in sort of 
understanding the way that Joe 
Biden deals with other foreign 

leaders, the sort of policies he’s 
articulated,” 
Larson 
said. 
“I 
think the United States needs 
a strong presence abroad …(not 
just) in terms of his cooperation 
with world leaders but also his 
willingness to engage with the 
countries.”
Biden spoke to the importance 
of regaining trust from America’s 
allies, 
denouncing 
Trump’s 
relationships with “thugs and 
dictators.” 

He 
concluded 
by 
urging 
attendees to remain hopeful and 
continue to fight for what they 
believe in. 
“Everybody knows who Donald 
Trump is; let’s let him know who 
we are,” Biden said. “We choose 
hope over fear; we, Americans, 
choose unity over division; we, 
Democrats, choose science over 
fiction and we choose truth over 
lies, let’s get up and let’s take this 
back now.”

Opinion
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

W

ith the Democratic 
primaries 
in 
full 
swing, 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 
campus 
is 
becoming 
dense 
with 
political 
advocacy 
— 
fliers, voter registration drives, 
candidate offices opening and 
endorsements are present at 
every corner. As people begin 
to discuss the primaries online 
and on campus, students want 
to take part in the monumental 
2020 
presidential 
election. 
Conversations 
range 
from 
preferred 
candidates 
to 
potential policies to the peculiar 
statements made in debates. 
However, 
a 
commonality 
that ties many of the topics 
together is touchy, personal and 
controversial: money. In the 
Democratic primary, the role of 
personal wealth is flagrant. Front 
runner Sen. Bernie Sanders, 
I-Vt., has made working-class 
issues the cornerstone of his 
campaign, while Mayor Michael 
Bloomberg, D-N.Y., is pouring 
his $56.1 billion net worth 
into mimicking a grassroots 
campaign 
with 
personal 
social 
media 
advertisements 
despite making condescending 
comments about blue-collar jobs.
During the 2016 election, 
President 
Donald 
Trump 
effectively utilized his personal 
wealth and experience as an 
entrepreneur to garner support. 
The narrative of being a “self-
made” 
billionaire 
paints 
an 
image of independent work ethic 
and success; despite flaunting his 
wealth, he was still able to run 
as a political outsider positioned 
to end corruption. His “drain 
the swamp” mantra has been 
satirized following his tactful 
cabinet placements. However, 
the impact of financial affluence 
in politics runs much deeper than 
the presidency and a fascination 
with billionaires. Voters who 
have firmly established opinions 
on billionaires should keep in 
mind that positions and policy 
can change, but deeply rooted 
opinions tend not to. Rather than 
having cyclical discussions on 
the merits of enormous wealth 
acquisition, we must focus on 
how the current system favors 
private interests over public 
values.
Campaign finance legislation 
protects the ability of wealth to 
be shielded from the public eye 
in local, state and nationwide 
campaigns. 
The 
state 
of 
Michigan has a deep history of 
insufficient campaign finance 
transparency and ranks last 
among the 50 states in the 
ability to analyze systems that 
enable corruption according 
to 
The 
Center 
for 
Public 
Integrity, to the detriment of 
our elections. Public access to 
information, lobbying disclosure 
and executive, legislative and 

judicial authority are the other 
glaring issues the state is failing 
to address. Donation limits are 
spotty at best, pathetic at worst. 
The Secretary of State website 
that should accessibly show 
campaign finance is convoluted. 
Critical information is buried 
by 
complex 
search 
engine 
fields and a lack of coherent 
organization to the detriment 
of 
constituents 
seeking 
to 
educate themselves on their 
options for representation. This 
particularly impacts those with 
less proficient digital literacy. 
These deeply embedded policy 
issues are being buried with 
other political discourse. They 
must be exposed, discussed and 
changed — reforming a system 
that hides dark money must be 
at the forefront of conversations 
about money in politics as 
opposed to whether a candidate 
is a billionaire.

Systemic 
failures 
are 
reinforced by electing people 
that 
directly 
benefit 
from 
that 
system. 
Independent 
organizations, like the National 
Rifle Association, invest vast 
sums of money in candidates 
that will strike down gun 
control legislation, despite the 
majority of the public claiming 
we need to combat gun violence. 
With the 2020 presidential 
election fast approaching, it is 
time to discuss these hidden 
(and not so hidden) influences.
The 
political-economic 
system 
is 
reinforced 
by 
campaigns 
powered 
by 
personal wealth. Trump used 
his self-described success as 
a tool for his campaign; as a 
businessman, he knew how 
to negotiate deals and get 
things done. This narrative 
was bolstered by the assertion 
that Trump was “self-made,” 
when in fact his “small loan of 
a million dollars” was actually 
more than $413 million, when 
factoring in inflation. This 
falsehood was not a partisan 
belief.
Both 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats 
misperceived 
Trump’s financial background 
surrounding 
his 
2016 
presidential run. Statements 
like “I built what I built myself” 
and “I did it by working long 
hours 
and 
working 
hard 
and 
working 
smart” 
evoke 

admiration and empathy from 
some constituents, veiling his 
cushioned life and access to 
an array of business ventures 
from his family’s wealth and 
network. Utilizing the “pull 
yourself up by your bootstraps” 
narrative establishes solidarity 
with working and middle-class 
voters who believe hard work 
is the main element of success. 
This tactic is unethical because 
it implies he has had similar 
life experiences when in truth 
he always had the wealth to 
fall back on. His interests lie 
in maintaining the system that 
allowed him and his family to 
accumulate immense wealth, 
not reforming it to the needs of 
the working class.
The 
crux 
of 
the 
conflicting 
narratives 
surrounding 
billionaires, 
between 
vilification 
and 
romanticization, 
lies 
within 
each 
individual’s 
unique 
perspective 
on 
how 
the 
economy works; we typically 
fall somewhere between the 
notion of rugged individualism 
and systemic assistance and 
restraint. And these values are 
not easily changed. Political 
discourse should be rooted in 
the realities of how democracy 
is 
being 
damaged 
by 
the 
influence of immense sums 
of money from both elected 
representatives 
and 
non-
government 
organizations. 
Rather than if we believe 
billionaires are good or bad, our 
discussions should be driven 
by ideas that can change, like 
positions on the specific policies 
that allows dark money to be 
shielded 
from 
constituents. 
Disguising the role of money in 
the policies politicians support 
when elected is a deliberate aim 
to deceive their constituents, 
undermining the desires of 
the people, which should be 
the focus of the narratives of 
wealth.
When politicians misguide 
the public about the source of 
their funds, the signals that 
should be flagged are muted in 
the convoluted and congested 
political narrative that tends 
to 
focus 
on 
salaciousness. 
Acknowledging the difference 
between how we conceptualize 
wealth and how money plays a 
role in democracy will be crucial 
in healing a deeply flawed and 
unrepresentative 
government. 
It is our duty as students of the 
University, and as citizens, to 
understand that some values 
cannot be debated — we must 
focus our energy on educating 
ourselves on the flawed policies 
that protect dark money and 
how to redirect the narrative of 
money in politics.

Y

ou wake up in the morning 
and switch on your light. 
With that flick of your 
index finger, you are complicit. You 
are causing the seas to rise, likely 
leading to the displacement of 
between 32 and 80 million people. 
You are responsible for the future 
death of all coral reefs, ridding 
over 500 million people of their 
livelihoods. You are responsible for 
increased water scarcity, affecting 
over 350 million people.
Is this fair? No. But that is 
what politicians, corporations 
and people in power are 
saying these days: handing 
you, 
the 
individual, 
the 
burden of ending the climate 
crisis and the guilt associated 
with not being able to.
Over 
the 
past 
several 
months, I have witnessed 
many 
examples 
of 
our 
community leaders — both at 
the University of Michigan 
and city level — shirking the 
responsibility to act on the 
current climate crisis and 
instead calling for increased 
individual 
action 
and 
behavioral change.
At the Ann Arbor City 
Council meeting last April, 
City 
Councilwoman 
Anne 
Banister, 
D-Ward 
1, 
voted 
against dedicating $880,000 
to address climate change at 
the city level, stating how “we 
can demand that the city do 
a bunch of stuff but I would 
again urge that people look at 
their own choices.” Similarly, 
during a public town hall about 
the 
President’s 
Commission 
on Carbon Neutrality (PCCN) 
that same month, University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
explained that “we really do 
as individuals share not just in 
the need to have a successful 
outcome, but in actually driving 
that success.”
At 
a 
carbon 
neutrality 
town 
hall 
in 
September, 
Stephen Forrest, co-chair of 
PCCN, stated that “this isn’t 
just the responsibility of the 
University administration. It’s 
the responsibility of all of us, 
turning off lights, unplugging 
our chargers and things like 
that. These things are actually 
really meaningful if you add 
them up.” At a similar panel 
discussion on the intersection of 
businesses and carbon `told the 

audience he walks four miles 
round-trip to work every day 
in an effort to reduce his own 
carbon footprint. Forrest said 
that “if even a small number 
of individuals adjusted their 
everyday activities to reduce 
their carbon footprint, society 
could potentially begin to take 
steps toward carbon neutrality.”
These 
recommendations 
from our leaders illustrate two 
possibilities: They are either 
knowingly parroting fossil fuel 
industry talking points or are 
showing their complete lack 
of understanding of the way in 
which systems shape individual 
action. Similarly to how the 
fossil fuel industry profits from 
our current reliance on fossil 
fuels, corporations, institutions 
and the powerful reap the 
benefits of our current systems 
— both economic and political — 
that prioritize their profit over 
our planet, and are the causes of 
the current climate crisis.

In 
other 
words, 
climate 
change is a symptom of a far-too-
long overlooked side effect of our 
current economic and political 
systems that protect money 
and power at the expense of all 
else. When those with wealth 
and power have something to 
lose from correctly addressing 
the causes of the climate crisis, 
it is easier for them to double 
down on greenwashing and 
calls for individual behavior 
change. 
We 
are 
instructed 
to unplug our chargers and 
turn 
our 
lights 
off 
while 
corporations 
go 
unchecked, 
profiting from the destruction 
of our ecosystems. Just 100 
companies are responsible for 
71 percent of global greenhouse 
gas emissions, and 20 of those 
corporations 
are 
responsible 
for a whopping 35 percent of all 
global emissions.

As Thoreau (bleh, I know) 
states 
in 
his 
essay 
“Civil 
Disobedience”: “I quarrel not 
with far-off foes, but those who, 
near at home, cooperate with, 
and do the bidding of, those far 
away, and without whom the 
latter would be harmless.” To 
be clear, I quarrel with both the 
far-off foes and those near at 
home, with names like Banister, 
Schlissel and Forrest. Forrest, 
for example, makes $344,000 
annually and can afford to live 
close enough to walk to work, 
while living in a city with such 
an extreme lack of housing 
and housing affordability that 
graduate student employees, 
who are attempting to bargain 
over more affordable housing 
and climate action, are told 
they should live in other cities 
and commute to. Forrest is by 
no means the villain of this 
story, but his actions and words 
are emblematic of a larger 
issue: It is leaders like him 
— those who have benefitted 
from current systems of power 
and are therefore reluctant to 
change them — that stand in 
our way and in the way of a 
livable planet.
When we find ourselves 
living in a society that has 
been built from the ground 
up on human exploitation, 
resource 
extraction, 

fossil fuel use and power 
accumulation, the individual 
will always be complicit, 
rendering individual action 
by itself futile. I am not 
telling you to stop reducing 
meat 
consumption, 
or 
stop 
getting 
on 
busses, 
or stop turning off lights 
and 
unplugging 
chargers. 
And I’m not saying that 
you don’t bear some of the 
responsibility for causing the 
climate crisis and carry some of 
the burdens of solving it. What 
I’m saying is that in order to 
correctly address this crisis, 
today’s systems of exploitation 
and inequality must be toppled. 
Only collective action can do 
just that.

Students exposed to hate in Ann Arbor

O

n Dec. 17, 2019, two 
of my friends and I 
were walking on East 
William 
Street. 
A 
middle-
aged white male who seemed 
intoxicated 
aggressively 
shouted 
“f***ing 
Asian 
b*tches!” at us. On Feb. 24, 
2020 two loiterers at the State 
Street entrance to Nickels 
Arcade asked me for money 
before 
telling 
each 
other 
“he doesn’t speak English.” 
In both incidents, to avoid 
confrontation, I couldn’t do 
anything but walk away.
Compared to many major 
cities in the United States 
I have visited, Ann Arbor is 
considered a relatively safe 
place. In fact, it has been 
recognized by Niche — a 
ranking and review site — as 
one of the best cities to live 
in America, in terms of both 
the 
overall 
environment 
and safety. But at the same 
time, University of Michigan 
students 
living 
in 
Ann 
Arbor are not completely 
free from the problems that 
plague the rest of America. 
University 
buildings 
are 
spread throughout the city, 
making 
the 
boundary 
of 
campus quite blurry. When it 
comes to housing, 69 percent 
of students at the University 
live off-campus. Many major 
student 
apartments 
are 
located downtown, directly 
adjacent 
to 
where 
these 
incidents took place. This 
makes 
students 
returning 
to their homes after class 
or activities late at night 
vulnerable to those types of 
unpleasant encounters.
The Ann Arbor experience 
is an implied part of the 
University 
experience. 
Although those incidents did 
not involve physical violence 
or bodily harm, those hateful 
and racist remarks offend, 
upset and discourage students 
of 
minority 
identities. 
Even 
if 
the 
University 

prioritizes diversity, equity 
and inclusion, the scope of 
student life often reaches 
beyond 
the 
University’s 
jurisdiction. Life in the city 
and at the University are 
inalienable, and the hate on 
the streets clearly affects 
student life.
In order to resolve these 
incidents, 
students, 
the 
University and the city of Ann 
Arbor should work together. 
According to the University’s 
Division 
of 
Public 
Safety 
and Security, DPSS officers 
are working with the Ann 
Arbor 
Police 
Department 
regarding campus and near-
campus 
neighborhoods’ 

safety. Since DPSS’s mission 
is to ensure the safety of 
the University community, 
it 
should 
prioritize 
protecting 
students 
from 
external 
threats, 
instead 
of 
internally 
patrolling 
students, arbitrarily making 
assumptions 
of 
drinking 
activity and authoritatively 
searching 
random 
dorm 
rooms. On March 24, 2019, 
a 
DPSS 
officer 
entered 
my dorm room and falsely 
assumed my friend and I 
were drinking. She asked us 
to show her my refrigerator 
and trash bin. After treating 
us with baseless suspicion, 
she left without apologizing. 
Compared 
to 
searching 
non-existent 
alcohol 
consumption, 
addressing 
hate incidents seems to be 

much 
more 
urgent. 
This 
suggests that DPSS should 
look outward, not inward. 
Moreover, it is imperative 
that the community recognize 
the urgency of this issue. 
Even though hate incidents 
do not necessarily involve 
physical violence or damage, 
the consequence should not 
be overlooked. As shown in 
other recent incidents nearby, 
hate 
speech 
negatively 
impacts 
the 
educational 
community and discourages 
minority students. Students 
might 
perceive 
that 
they 
do not belong to the local 
community, 
or 
develop 
a 
negative 
impression 
of 
Ann Arbor, or their college 
experience 
in 
general. 
Therefore, 
the 
city 
and 
University authorities should 
cooperate and take action, 
not 
necessarily 
through 
prosecution, 
but 
through 
proactive 
measures 
such 
as 
patrolling 
near-campus 
neighborhoods 
to 
prevent 
such fear in the first place.
Ann Arbor is home to over 
60,000 students. Regardless 
of where they come from, Ann 
Arbor is where they spend the 
majority of their time during 
their college years. In order 
for any student to feel they 
belong to this city, internally 
emphasizing diversity, equity 
and inclusion is not enough. 
These incidents especially 
target minority students and 
significantly degrade their 
experiences in Ann Arbor. 
This can negatively impact 
their university experience 
as well. Therefore, I call 
on 
the 
University 
and 
city 
authorities 
to 
work 
together to not only address 
this urgent issue but also 
prevent these instances from 
happening in the future.

Surrounded 
by 
Michigan 
paraphernalia 
in 
the 
Three 
Cats Cafe, Dan Scanlon looks 
comfortable and at home because 
he is. As someone born and raised 
in Clawson, MI, it’s no wonder 
Scanlon is eager to talk about 
“Onward,” 
Scanlon’s 
highly 
anticipated film based on his 
own childhood, in his real-life 
hometown. 
Scanlon has worked with Pixar 
for many years, taking part in many 
films such as “Cars,” “Brave” and 
“Monsters University.” “Onward,” 
however, is the first original Pixar 
film that he is directing, and what 
makes it even more special is that its 
storyline was derived from his own 
life. Scanlon, similar to the film’s 
protagonist Ian Lightfoot, voiced 
by Tom Holland (“Spider-Man: 
Homecoming”), lost his father at a 
young age and had to learn how to 
live his life without him. 
When 
it 
came 
to 
making 
“Onward,” Scanlon said he set out 
to address the nagging questions 
you have to sit with in the face of 
loss. “What would you do if you 
could meet someone you lost? What 
would you say to them that you 
didn’t say before?”
At the same time, Scanlon added, 
“You don’t get that opportunity, 
sadly … ” What you do get, though, 
is the chance to call up the people 
“who did more than they had to to 
help you become the adult you are 

today… if they’re still around and 
thank them for what they did.” 
Luckily for Scanlon, he had a 
supportive older brother, just like 
Barley Lightfoot (voiced by Chris 
Pratt, “Guardians of the Galaxy”), 
and a devoted mother, just like 
Laurel Lightfoot (voiced by Julia 
Louis-Dreyfus, “Veep”), that he 
could rely on. And, by calling on the 
experiences and memories that he 

had with those valuable people in 
his own life, he created a stunning, 
realistic and moving film meant for 
everyone, not just children. 
The beauty of “Onward” lies 
in its two central characters, Ian 
and Barley. These two brothers 
are what Scanlon refers to as “a 
different type of brother and a 
different type of man.” They are 
shamelessly unafraid of being 

genuine and heartfelt towards one 
another, while still maintaining an 
easy, teasing banter. They disregard 
any and all expectations and 
stereotypes of toxic masculinity. 
Ian and Barley have a “sincere, 
sensitive relationship” and have no 
problem being “vulnerable” with 
each other, Scanlon said. Ian’s shy 
qualities are well-matched with his 
brother Barley’s wildness, and they 
have to work together to succeed 
in their quest to spend one final 
day with the father they barely 
remember. Barley’s endless support 
of Ian is based on the support 
Scanlon received, and continues 
to receive, from his own brother 
Bill, who “has been such a fan...and 
supporter of the movie,” since he 
first saw it at the Pixar wrap party. 
While the whole film is full 
of love and sincerity, there is one 
part in particular that will be 
remembered as the most touching 
scene. In fact, when I asked Scanlon 
what he believes is the most iconic, 
“where’s my supersuit?” scene 
of the film, he didn’t hesitate in 
answering “the end.” He purposely 
styled it so that the visual aspects 
would stand out “even if you have 
the sound down.” And he’s right. 
Every image, every motion in that 
climactic scene has you holding 
your breath, even with little to no 
sound being heard. That scene 
sums up the whole movie for me. 
It makes you hug your siblings a 
little tighter and look your parents 
in the eyes when you thank them 
for everything they’ve done. It’s a 
reminder of those you have with 
you and a tribute to those you no 
longer do.

FILM INTERVIEW
FILM INTERVIEW

You probably haven’t heard of 
Brandy Clark before, but you’ve 
definitely heard one of her songs. 
Between “Follow Your Arrow” by 
Kacey Musgraves and Miranda 
Lambert’s 
“Mama’s 
Broken 
Heart,” she’s penned hits for 
some of the best in the business. 
On her third album, Your Life is a 
Record, Clark proves she saves her 
strongest songwriting for herself. 
Often, Clark’s prowess with 
words interrupts the song itself. 
The listener is forced to take 
pause, not because a verse is 
particularly weighty, but because 
it takes time to unravel a clever 
joke. Clark’s nuggets of humor are 
everywhere. In “Bad Car” Clark 
plays with a common saying to 
sing about her car’s dysfunction. 
“Yeah, there’s death and taxes, 
and the check engine light 
blinkin’ on,” she sighs.
Some 
lines 
are 
snicker-
inducing: “Can’t eat this, you can’t 
eat that / Is there anything that 
ain’t giving cancer to rats?” she 
deadpans on “Bigger Boat.” While 
she excels at one liners, Clark also 
knows how to set a scene. The 
chorus of “Long Walk,” a Kacey 
Musgraves-reminiscent 
kiss-
off to a mudslinging neighbor, 
sketches 
out 
a 
progression 
of images that run through 
your mind like a comic strip. 
Simultaneously sharp and campy, 
Clark provides her nemesis with 
a detailed set of instructions on 

how to “take a long walk off a real 
short pier.”
Zooming out, it’s clear that 
Clark takes the title of her album 
seriously. Each song dips into a 
pocket of everyday life — and the 
way Clark makes normalcy shine 
is like spinning hay into gold. In 
“Pawn Shop,” she traces the end 
of two broken dreams — a woman 
pawns off her wedding ring 
and a struggling singer pawns 
his guitar. But, Clark promises, 
when the shop opens again, the 
items “will start a new dream 
secondhand.” 

“Who You Thought I Was” 
is the record’s heartbeat. Clark 
recounts all of the things she 
used to want to do until she met 
her significant other — but there’s 
a twist. In the bridge the listener 
finds out that Clark’s relationship 
is over, so what sounds like a love 
song at first is suddenly flipped 
on its head. This bait and switch 
is emblematic of Clark’s artistry 
in general. The everyday is 
extraordinary and the expected 
isn’t what you think — you just 
have to pay attention.

The track that expands these 
snapshots into a nation-spanning 
statement 
is 
“Bigger 
Boat.” 
While recognizing the country’s 
political polarization, this song 
seems to situate Clark on the 
sidelines. 
Its 
instrumentation 
is both timeless and playful, 
resembling the Disney songs that 
Randy Newman, who is featured 
on the track, is known for. This 
makes his presence on the song a 
bit eerie. It’s discomforting to hear 
a voice of childhood’s past giving 
up on America getting along. But 
not so fast. Understanding Clark’s 
approach to songwriting suggests 
that her call for “a bigger boat” 
is sarcastic. What she’s really 
calling for is unity.
Despite writing for country 
stars, Your Life is a Record is 
categorized as singer/songwriter. 
This classification makes sense 
as most of the songs could easily 
fit into any coffee shop playlist. 
Instead of featuring banjo licks, 
the songs are stripped in a way 
that shows off Clark’s voice and 
lyrics. 
What 
does 
this 
mean 
for country music, a genre 
experiencing an endless identity 
crisis? Most likely it means that 
one of its best songwriters knew 
that she wasn’t going to get any 
airplay with a country record 
anyway, so she decided to take the 
opportunity to sonically expand. 
Clark’s 
lyrics 
speak 
for 
themselves. Your Life is a Record 
puts a magnifying glass on the 
small moments and makes it all 
feel big. If your life really is a 
record, you would be lucky if it 
was half as good as Clark’s is.

WARNER

In her collection of short 
stories, “Look How Happy I’m 
Making You,” Polly Rosenwaike 
captures 
the 
experience 
of 
motherhood from all angles. 
Rosenwaike 
cultivates 
her 
book’s appeal in the very first 
page, 
instantly 
dismissing 
any preconceptions a reader 
might have about a book on 
motherhood. It would be easy 
to write off this book as one for 
mothers — or at least for women 
— 
but 
Rosenwaike 
clarifies 
that this book is for anyone 
and everyone by starting her 
collection with the line, “We 
are all in love with the baby.” 
The book draws the reader 
in immediately, regardless of 
whether or not they have any 
special interest in motherhood. 
The 
narration 
defamiliarizes 
the experience of interacting 
with a baby, saying, “he tracks 
our shopworn, overly articulated 
faces,” effectively describing the 
silly faces we all make at babies 
in a way that is beautiful. This 
beginning, something we can 
all relate to, makes motherhood 
accessible and sets the stage 
for the arduous journey the 
book charts through the lives 
of many different versions of 
motherhood. 
In 
a 
collection 
of 
short 
stories with different narrators, 
maintaining 
a 
continuity 
of 
theme from one segment to the 

next can be difficult. Not only 
does Rosenwaike make it seem 
easy, she exploits the different 
perspectives in order to force 
the 
reader 
to 
reckon 
with 
the decisions that come with 
motherhood. Every character 
is understandable to the reader, 
from the woman grappling with 
her aunt’s death at the same time 

as her baby’s birth, to the woman 
having an affair with a younger 
man right after becoming a 
mother. 
The 
most 
poignant 
comparison 
by 
proximity, 
however, 
was 
between 
the 
stories “Grow Your Eyelashes” 
and “Field Notes.” In the first 
story, the woman at the center 
tries desperately to conceive and 
keep a baby, and her failure to do 
so is rendered in precise prose. 

In the story that directly follows 
it, the woman gets pregnant and 
decides to have an abortion. 
“Decides” is a strong word — it 
is already a foregone conclusion. 
She is sad about it, as anyone 
would be, but she never truly 
considers keeping the baby. 
Even as a staunch supporter 
of a woman’s right to choose, 
it is almost impossible not to 
feel 
accusatory 
toward 
the 
woman in the second story. 
The first story puts the reader 
in the headspace of someone 
for whom having a baby would 
be a blessing, so when it is a 
curse for the second narrator, 
we still are angry with her for 
squandering 
an 
opportunity 
the first woman would have 
cherished. It produces a strange 
feeling in the heart and mind of 
someone who has always been 
pro-choice, one that is certainly 
illuminating. For people of all 
political persuasions, however, 
it finally depoliticizes the issue 
of abortion. Choosing whether 
or not to terminate a pregnancy 
once again becomes a human 
issue, one based on the minutiae 
of each woman’s experience, 
unable to be explained away by a 
single story. 
Rosenwaike 
tactfully 
deals 
with 
another 
topic 
that is inextricably linked to 
motherhood, 
despite 
often 
going undiscussed: postpartum 
depression. 
Society 
likes 
to 
paint early motherhood as a 
rosy blossoming of the mother-
child relationship fueled by the 
joy of watching a tiny person 

experience the world for the 
first time. This is the case for 
some women — but for women 
with 
postpartum 
depression, 
that picture can feel like a slap 
in the face. Rosenwaike slips 
in a short story that deals with 
postpartum depression head-on, 
right in-between other stories 
about 
various 
tribulations 
of motherhood. This is the 
first, and perhaps most subtle, 
success in dealing with this 
topic: she does not separate 
it 
from 
the 
others, 
which 
would make it seem shameful. 
Instead, it is just another story 
among 
stories, 
effectively 
normalizing 
a 
stigmatized 
subject. Her structure is also 
notable — she formats the piece 
as a list of sorts, titled “Ten 
Warning Signs of Postpartum 
Depression,” like a WikiHow 
help piece. Her prose pinpoints 
the disgust she feels with the 
entire 
situation, 
describing 
her baby as “a disappointed 
old woman,” her birth as an 

experience that hurt so much 
“you thought something must be 
wrong,” and thoughts of hurting 
her baby that occur “within 
the realm of the horrifically 

possible.” Rosenwaike describes 
in 
excruciating 
detail 
the 
way support can sometimes 
feel inadequate, that all the 
expectations 
placed 
onto 

mothers can make one feel like 
“a manufacturing fluke.”
On a happier note, the book 
manages to capture some of the 
rosiness of pregnancy without 
sounding 
trite 
or 
clichéd. 
Rosenwaike 
reflects 
on 
the 
many wonders of witnessing a 
tiny being come into existence. 
Her 
characters 
say 
things 
like “Sometimes I thought my 
ballooning body was beautiful” 
and “I liked the way my skin 
stretched so tightly over my 
belly.” They ponder over things 
like “a brand-new face” and 
“the dawning of all kinds of 
consciousnesses.” They convince 
us so thoroughly of their reality 
and demonstrate so much resolve 
and pure awe in the face of 
struggles that have existed since 
the very beginning of humanity, 
that when Rosenwaike casually 
says that “the meaning of life” 
is “to continue it,” we do not 
even question it. Instead, it 
seems obvious, undeniable, like a 
foregone conclusion.

As “Better Call Saul” begins 
its fifth and penultimate season, 
it continues to inch closer to the 
timeline of the “Breaking Bad” 
universe. Last season saw the 
addition 
of 
undercover 
meth 
distributor-businessman Gus Fring 
(Giancarlo 
Esposito, 
“Breaking 
Bad”) and in its most recent 
episode, it appears DEA Agent 
Hank 
Schrader 
(Dean 
Norris, 
“Superstore”) will also play a major 
role in the coming seasons. With the 
recent news that “Better Call Saul” 
will end after six seasons, it makes 
it much more intriguing for fans 
of the “Breaking Bad” franchise 
to predict the series’ endgame as 
the plots of Fring, Mike (Jonathan 
Banks, “Breaking Bad”) and Nacho 
(Michael Mando, “Psych”) all head 
in the same direction. 
Part of the brilliance of “Breaking 
Bad” is the observation of Walter 
White’s moral decay from a nebbish 
science teacher to the leading meth 
chef of the Southwest. In contrast to 
gradual character transformation, 
perhaps the most clever challenge 
taken up by “Better Call Saul” is 
its utilization of similar narrative 
arcs to reveal how some of the 

most prominent characters from 
“Breaking Bad” ended up involved 
with drug cartels. “Better Call Saul” 
spends a considerable amount of 
time explaining these characters’ 
various backstories, which can be 
frustrating at times — particularly 
for viewers of “Breaking Bad” — but, 
narratively, appears to be worth the 
payoff. 

We’ve spent the better part of 
four seasons watching Mike evolve 
from working the ticket booth 
at a parking lot to becoming one 
of Fring’s most valued security 
officers. The conclusion of last 
season saw Jimmy McGill (Bob 
Odenkirk, 
“Breaking 
Bad”) 
officially register to practice law 
under the name Saul Goodman.
In these first few episodes of 
Season 5, Jimmy/Saul markets 
himself as a lawyer for those looking 

to engage in criminal activity at 
a heavily discounted price. Upon 
being recruited by Lalo Salamanca 
(Tony 
Dalton, 
“Sense8”), 
the 
following episodes find Jimmy 
at the center of the imminent 
war between the Mexican drug 
cartel run by the Salamancas and 
the hometown drug team led by 
Fring, effectively placing Jimmy 
in opposition to Mike, whom he’s 
worked closely with in the past. For 
the characters who don’t appear in 
“Breaking Bad,” a sense of danger 
looms on the horizon — even for 
Jimmy’s current girlfriend, Kim 
Wexler (Rhea Seehorn, “Veep”), a 
more accomplished lawyer.
Kim and Jimmy’s relationship 
may appear sweet, but at its center 
their codependency is toxic. In the 
past, Kim was willing to stretch 
the ethical boundaries of her 
job because Jimmy was worth 
it. Despite Kim’s best efforts to 
push Jimmy in the direction of 
becoming a responsible lawyer, he’s 
changed his name and the clients he 
represents. Now that she’s distanced 
herself from Jimmy — and his “50% 
off non-violent felonies” deal — she’s 
forced to reflect on how much of 
Jimmy’s personality she’s allowed 
to incorporate into her own.

‘Saul’ sets up an endgame

TV REVIEW
TV REVIEW

It is notable that not every 
piece of literature or media by and 
about women is feminist. The label 
gets used so frequently to mean 
“anything 
mostly 
concerning 
women, created by one” that the 
word mostly connotes, at this 
point, more of a sanguine, positive 
approach 
to 
femininity 
than 
anything else. This makes Gabrielle 
Annan’s use of the word to describe 
Fleur Jaeggy’s 1989 novella “Sweet 
Days Of Discipline” in a review in 
The New York Review of Books 
surprising. I’m willing to follow 
this association, though given how 
intensely perverse Fleur Jaeggy’s 
work is, how much it seems to resist 
any reading is not on its own terms. 
The book is pretty much entirely 
populated by women, to be sure. 
The men appear as bemused, 
slightly pathetic interlopers in 
the intensely feminine boarding 
school atmosphere. The narrator 
writes that she “got to know 
headmistresses, reverend mothers, 
mother superiors, and Mères 
préfètes.” Boarding schools are 
places of total submission, where 

every aspect of a young girl’s life is 
itemized and subject to inspection. 
The nameless narrator of Jaeggy’s 
novella 
recounts 
periodic, 
unpredictable inspections of the 
cupboards the students kept their 
linens in. The formal aspects of this 
strict regime seem almost beside 
the point, but the narrator does 

recount a school where all the girls 
kissed the hand of Mère préfète 
before bed. 
It is unsurprising, then, that the 
girls increasingly only have this 
way of relating to each other. The 
plot of the book, such as there is one 
(Jaeggy writes in a fascinatingly 
atemporal way, sentences following 

each other with little connective 
material, 
juggling 
spaces 
and 
times) involves the narrator’s 
involvement with Frédérique, a 
slightly older girl who is able to 
embody the boarding school’s ideal 
of strict discipline more completely 
than anyone else, so much so that 
she “never needed to curtsey, 
because her way of respecting 
others instilled respect.” The 
narrator starts noticing details, 
like 
someone 
close-reading 
a 
text. 
Frédérique 
never 
looks 
in the mirror. Frédérique eats 
“with her elbows pressed against 
her bust.” Frédérique speaks to 
herself occasionally, “moving her 
lips and staring at something like 
emptiness.” 
It’s unclear what the narrator 
wants of her, but there’s an 
ominousness 
baked 
into 
the 
whole process. From the get-go, 
the narrator says she wants to 
“conquer” Frédérique, something 
that in practice means a kind of 
mastery of the site of submission 
— the logic of boarding school 
miniaturized and focused on one 
person. It’s both erotic and not. 
The reproduction of this imposed 
discipline (and thus the reassertion 
of control over it) becomes the 
narrator’s way of relating to most 
everything in the world.

Adversity shaping postseason for ‘M’

Juwan Howard’s first regular 
season as the Michigan men’s 
basketball coach featured no 
shortage of adversity.
Bad news began trickling in 
before the Wolverines even took 
the court for the first time in 
November. Less than two weeks 
before the season tipped off, 
freshman wing Franz Wagner 
fractured his wrist in practice.
The injury didn’t require 
surgery, but it forced him to 
miss 
Michigan’s 
first 
four 
games. Even when he joined the 
lineup, the lingering effects on 
his shooting wrist were evident 
in 
his 
29-percent 
3-point 
shooting clip through mid-
February.
The 
recovery 
period 
was 
particularly 
difficult 
for 
Wagner, 
who 
was 
simultaneously trying to adapt 
to the American college level 
after spending last season with 
German club Alba Berlin.
“The injury in October set 
him back with his stroke,” 
associate 
head 
coach 
Phil 
Martelli said on Feb. 22. “I 
think he’s a purer shooter than 
we’re seeing.”
Since then, Wagner has found 
his jump shot. He’s shooting 
42 percent from beyond the 
arc over the Wolverines’ last 
five games — a mark that has 
allowed him to become the 
team’s leading scorer over the 
same stretch.
But as Michigan worked 
through 
the 
adversity 
of 
Wagner’s 
injury, 
a 
second 
starter 
went 
down. 
Junior 
forward Isaiah Livers missed 
six 
games 
after 
landing 
awkwardly following a dunk 
attempt against Presbyterian on 
Dec. 21, and when he returned 
a month later, he reaggravated 
his groin on a near-identical 
play. His absence stretched 
over the Wolverines’ next three 
games before an ankle injury 
forced him to sit out a fourth.

Michigan has lost six of 
10 games against conference 
opponents without a healthy 
Livers.
“At 
some 
point, 
every 
team is going to go through 
(adversity),” 
Howard 
said 
Sunday. “It happened to us. I 
think we’ve learned a lot, and 
I think we’ve gotten better 
through the adversity. We’re 
going to forge ahead. … (I’m) 
praying to the basketball gods 
that we’ll continue to have good 
health.”
Adversity has taken forms 
besides injury, particularly at 
inopportune moments. Howard 
handed 
senior 
point 
guard 
Zavier Simpson a one-game 
suspension in January following 
a 3 a.m. traffic incident on 
Jan. 26. In late December, an 
illness held sophomore forward 
Brandon Johns Jr. out of a non-
conference tune-up.
Most recently, junior guard 
Eli Brooks’s broken nose kept 
him out of last week’s loss 
to Wisconsin. Without their 
ace perimeter defender, the 
Wolverines 
surrendered 
a 
season-worst 
11 
3-pointers. 
Before returning three days 
later, he had to overcome a sinus 
infection he claimed was even 
more painful than the fractured 
nose itself.
The only starter to suit up 
for every game of the regular 
season was senior center Jon 
Teske. The sum of the adversity 
was a 10-10 Big Ten record 

and a bottom-half finish in the 
conference standings.
“Most definitely not what 
we wanted,” sophomore guard 
David DeJulius said Sunday. 
“And I think that goes back 
to the history of Michigan 
basketball, especially with the 
last few years, just with how 
much success they’ve had. We 
just talked about how even the 
(2018) national championship 
team that won the Big Ten 
Tournament, they didn’t win 
the regular season, so now 
everyone’s zero-and-zero.
“We just gotta come out there 
with a new-season mindset.”
With the regular season 
now in the books, Michigan’s 
postseason mindset is bolstered 
by the experience of regular-
season adversity. It knows what 
it’s like to play short-handed 
and lose, and it knows what it’s 
like to win with everyone in the 
fold.
The Wolverines grew from 
the adversity, learning about 
themselves in moments that 
otherwise 
would’ve 
never 
presented 
themselves. 
Even 
through a miserable January 
that saw Michigan drop five 
consecutive games for the first 
time since 2015, young players 
such as Johns and DeJulius 
proved themselves as viable 
rotational pieces.
And in the postseason, the 
silver lining of regular-season 
roadblocks could make all the 
difference.

Rauch’s dedication leads to recovery

Two-and-a-half 
weeks 
ago, 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico 
laughed as she held out her hand, 
pretending it was in an icebox. She 
was acting out sophomore guard 
Danielle Rauch’s squats as she 
tried to prevent her left hand from 
sweating while staying in shape.
Rauch broke her hand a day 
before Michigan’s Feb. 6 matchup 
against Purdue and missed the 
game because of her surgery that 
day.
Bones take six to eight weeks to 
heal.
Last 
Thursday 
against 
Nebraska, Rauch returned after 
just four.
“She says she has a plan, we’ll 
see,” Barnes Arico said after a Feb. 
19 victory over Illinois. “I don’t 
know, I’m not getting excited about 
it.”
There wasn’t a lot to be excited 
about. It was the second injury in as 
many weeks after senior forward 
Kayla Robbins tore her ACL, and 
Rauch couldn’t do any hard labor 
for two weeks. But as one of the 
emotional leaders on the team, she 
was immediately determined to get 
back in the game.
“When I got my stitches out, 
I went right into conditioning,” 

Rauch said. “I had a strength 
and conditioning plan with our 
strength coach. Every single day 
we had something, whether that’s 
on-court sprints, on the treadmill, 
in the weight room, just doing 
everything I can to keep my wind 
up.”
Her hard work kept her fit, 
but then came her shooting and 
handling.
As the backup point guard, 
she’s crucial to giving sophomore 
guard Amy Dilk rest, and her 
return would mean Dilk didn’t 
have to play 38 minutes every game 
anymore — if she could keep up her 
handles.
“I just kind of worked on it every 
day,” Rauch said. “Kept working 
on it, worked on it until I felt 
comfortable enough and was able 
to practice this week.”
Against Nebraska last Thursday, 
Rauch debuted her new look: Black 
tape around the middle of her hand, 
snaking up to wrap her middle two 
fingers. She was warming up, four 
weeks after breaking her hand and 
requiring surgery.
After spending four weeks 
sitting toward the end of the bench, 
when it came time to find her 
spot she looked to sit closer to the 
coaches, eager to tell them she was 
ready to play. Except that chair was 
now sophomore forward Emily 

Kiser’s. An awkward half second 
where both looked at the chair 
later, Rauch moved to the end of 
the bench.
She only sat for nine minutes 
before entering the game. 
Rauch played 22 minutes in the 
Big Ten Tournament, the seventh-
most on the team. She wasn’t the 
biggest contributor on the court, 
but her contributions have always 
been as an emotional voice and 
leader more than anything else.
She scored just two points 
all weekend. They came from a 
jumper at the corner of the key on 
Saturday, when Ohio State left her 
unmanned, not respecting her shot. 
She stopped her movement across 
the court, as if suddenly becoming 
aware of her space, and pulled up. 
The two points tied the game at 47 
early in the fourth quarter, capping 
off a massive comeback before the 
Buckeyes pulled back away.
“She was a kid that was playing 
30 minutes before she hurt that 
hand, and now she’s trying to 
just get back in to give us a couple 
minutes here and there to maybe 
give Amy a break,” Barnes Arico 
said. “I don’t think she’s 100 
percent.”
There are two weeks before 
Michigan plays its next game. By 
then, Rauch’s new look might be a 
bare hand.

Errors plague Wolverines in LA

In a weekend with little 
offensive 
production, 
the 
Michigan softball team looked 
toward its defense to hold 
games together, and scrape by 
with wins. For Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins, it didn’t do the 
job.
“Defense 
is 
led 
by 
the 
pitching,” 
Hutchins 
said. 
“When the pitchers are on, it 
makes our defense a lot easier. 
But I think in general we had 
opportunities a lot of times for 
outs that we didn’t make. Very 
passive and very tentative. Very 
unsure on the field.”
“I think our pitchers have 
set a really good tone. But our 
defense and offense need to pick 
up on it. Trust the pitchers, but 
have a little trust in themselves. 
I don’t think our defense was 
as good as it has been, but it’s 
definitely holding its own.”
The errors only compounded 
on the struggle the Wolverines 
faced 
at 
the 
UCLA/LBSU 
Invitational. Going 2-2 on the 
weekend, in what should’ve 
been 
a 
more 
successful 
weekend, 
the 
errors 
only 
added to the long list of things 
Michigan needs to work on.
For 
senior 
center 
fielder 
Haley Hoogenraad, the defense 
seemed fine.
“I 
think, 
personally, 
defense can win you games,” 
Hoogenraad said. “So, honestly, 
we are a pretty solid defensive 
team. There haven’t been a 
lot of times where we just fall 
apart in the field. We usually 
make good throws and good 
plays. So I think it’s important 
for us to keep up that consistent 
defensive play, but I also think 
we do a really nice job of it.”
The 
discrepancy 
between 
the two, coach and player, is 
bound to happen. Hutchins 
admitted she had spent four 
hours watching film before 
calling for her phone interview. 
It’s a different perspective, a 
different angle.
But in a weekend series 
that showcased the gaps in 
the Wolverines’ offense, the 

discrepancy 
between 
player 
and 
coach 
highlighted 
the 
importance of strong Michigan 
defense, 
something 
lacking 
over the weekend. 
As Hutchins said, defense 
starts 
with 
pitching. 
And 
starting 
against 
Boston 
University and closing against 
UCLA and Central Flordia, 
right 
hander 
Alex 
Storako 
played her typical, consistent 
game — with the exception of 
two errors.
The first came on Friday, 
against 
Boston 
University, 
when, in the top of the first, a 
ball was hit back to Storako. 
Bobbling it, she tried to flip it 
to first base, but missed and 
allowed the batter on base. 
It ended up being a minor 
error as both of the subsequent 
batters struck-out, but an error 
nonetheless.
Storako’s 
second 
error 
proved 
to 
be 
much 
more 
damaging for the Wolverines, as 
it ended Friday’s game against 
UCF, 
3-2, 
in 
extra innings. 
It 
followed 
an error from 
sophomore 
catcher 
Hannah 
Carson 
when 
she overthrew 
second 
base, 
allowing 
a 
stealing 
runner to take 
third.
The next batter up, Storako 
let go of a wild pitch, which 
forced Carson out of position 
to try and block, and provided 
UCF with a chance to score, 
which they took.
Storako had just six wild 
pitches in her 20 games last 
season. Yet, in the 17 games 
she’s played this season, she’s 
already racked up 11. But with 
her increased presence in the 
lineup comes the responsibility 
of making plays when it matters.
Carson 
also 
contributed 
another error, against UCLA 
when she overthrew junior 
first baseman, Lou Allan, on 
a dropped third strike. Again, 
her error didn’t have a major 

impact on the score of the game 
— the runner was tagged out in 
a rundown — but, like Storako, 
her increased role also demands 
an increased responsibility.
Freshman 
shortstop 
Julia 
Jimenez added another error 
on the weekend for a team total 
of five. Receiving a throw-down 
from Carson, and trying to tag a 
stealing runner out, Jimenez let 
the ball slip past her, allowing 
the runner to steal third.
All that said, errors are going 
to take place. It’s more about 
how Michigan responds to 
them than what the effect is in 
the moment they’re made. For 
the Wolverines’ benefit, their 
defense needs to remain strong 
because of their struggling 
offense. 
Without 
a 
strong 
defense, they will struggle on 
both sides of the plate. This 
could allow for more runs from 
other teams, something the 
Michigan pitchers work hard to 
contain.
Michigan needs to be able 
to find solace in 
its ability to rally 
on the defensive 
end even when 
the 
offense 
isn’t 
producing. 
Keeping 
a 
positive mindset, 
and sticking to 
the 
one-pitch 
focus — both in 
the batter’s box 
and on the field — 
is something the Wolverines are 
striving to do.
“Our biggest thing is, if you 
have a bad at-bat, it’s easy to just 
go internal with yourself and 
just kind of put yourself down 
and be distracted with that 
rather than be present in the 
moment, especially on the field,” 
Blair said. “Which, I think our 
defense has done really well 
with not letting the negatives 
in the game carry over. We 
just want to be present for our 
pitchers. Present for ourselves, 
for our team. And there’s always 
room for improvement and 
there are always opportunities 
in the game that we can take 
advantage of next time if we 
didn’t do it the first time.”

Michigan drops series to Pepperdine

Michigan’s 
high 
powered 
schedule took them to the West 
Coast yet again this weekend. But 
the California sunshine was the 
only consistent part of the trip for 
the Wolverines. 
Spotty offensive play plagued 
the No. 16 Michigan baseball team 
(8-7) as it fell to No. 24 Pepperdine 
(12-3) 2-1 in its weekend series. 
The Waves won the opening game 
14-2 and split the doubleheader 
on Saturday, with the Wolverines 
winning the first game 7-4 before 
dropping the final game, 6-1. 
In the first game of the series, a 
slow start doomed the Wolverines 
from the onset, leading to a 12-2 
loss. 
“We came up flat, didn’t have 
a lot of intensity,” freshman 
third baseman Ted Burton said. 
“They took advantage of us when 
we were down. We’ll be better 
intensity wise and playing-wise.”
The Waves have the highest 
batting average of Michigan’s 
opponents thus far and their 
heavy bats manifested themselves 
quickly. After going down in order 
in the top of the first, junior right-
hander Jeff Criswell got behind in 
the strike count in several at-bats. 
Ultimately, in the first inning 
alone he allowed three hits and 
three runs. 
“Whether it was finishing 
a hitter off with two strikes or 
putting the final out in the inning 
with two outs (we were unable to 
get out of the inning),” Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich said.
Criswell started to settle down 
and finished the day throwing five 
innings with seven strikeouts and 
not allowing another run past the 
first inning. 
The lone highlight of the 
opening 
game 
was 
junior 
shortstop 
Jack 
Blomgren’s 
production at the plate. Blomgren 
went 2-for-4 with two runs and 
an RBI, including a solo home run. 
His offensive production allowed 
Michigan to chip away at the 
deficit. 
But, the Wolverines left runners 
in scoring position multiple times. 
Blomgren’s home run may have 
cut the deficit to one run, but 
because Michigan left runners 

stranded earlier, it ultimately did 
not affect the outcome.
“We knew that their starting 
pitching is very good,” Bakich 
said. “We knew they are an older 
team. It’s a great offense that’s just 
got a lot of power. We knew we 
had to play well. Unfortunately, 
they capitalized on all of our 
mistakes.”
To begin the day Saturday, 
the 
Wolverines 
looked 
like 
a 
completely 
different 
team. 
Redshirt freshman left-hander 
Steven Hajjar threw a career-
high six innings and struck 
out a career-high 10 batters. 
Solidifying himself as the second 
pitcher in the rotation, he found 
success in his fastball and his off-
speed pitches, his curveball and 
changeup, to keep Pepperdine 
batters off balance. 
“We’re not a team that likes to 
get kicked around,” Hajjar said. 
“We go in and lose 14-2 that will 
fire anyone up. Coach Bakich 
gave us a good pregame speech 
that we need to earn this team’s 
respect and I think that fired me 
up personally.”
The 
offense 
complemented 
Hajjar’s pitching by scoring four 
runs in the third inning and taking 
advantage of walks. Lead-off 
hitter junior Jordan Nwogu went 
2-for-5 with one RBI, bouncing 
back from the first game where he 
went 0-for-4. 
“We are a team that has the 
ability to win this series and that’s 
what we showed in the second 
game,” Hajjar said. 
The final game of the weekend 
started off hot with Nwogu hitting 
the second ball he saw for a home-
run, but Michigan was unable to 

capitalize on this momentum. 
“I 
think 
the 
problem 
is 
that we didn’t use that to gain 
momentum,” Nwogu said. “We 
struggled the rest of the game to 
string quality at-bats together. I 
think sporadically we put together 
some good at-bats but not enough 
to plate runs.”
Nwogu recorded the only two 
hits of the day, but the Wolverines 
were able to get a total of 10 
baserunners via hit-by-pitch and 
walks. But they were unable to 
get many runners past second 
base and ultimately couldn’t bring 
home any of the runners. 
“We got a lot of runners to 
first and second but that’s about 
where they stopped,” Bakich said. 
“When your playing from behind 
and you’re down 4-1 and 6-1 and 
you can get the first two guys 
on, you can bunt them over. But 
a bunt at the point in the game 
when you’re down 4-1 we don’t 
really want to give up an out just 
to advance runners.”
Junior left-hander Blake Beers 
pitched five innings, allowing five 
hits and three runs. Michigan 
dipped into the bullpen three 
times, but its offensive struggles 
did nothing to help the pitchers 
out. 
“I think that we don’t have a 
problem with effort or anything 
like that we are really giving it 
our all it just didn’t happen for us 
today,” Beers said. “The biggest 
thing that we can take out of today 
is that we are giving it our all it’s 
just not happening for us right 
now. 
“It’s not a bad thing it seems 
like right now it’s just not all 
coming together.”
