University alum 

Dick Costolo 

explores successful 

leadership

By REBECCA SOLBERG

Daily Staff Reporter

It took him over 140 characters, 

but former Twitter CEO Dick 
Costolo spoke to a filled Rackham 
Graduate 
School 
auditorium 

Thursday on how he has found 
value in his liberal arts degree 

from the University throughout 
his career.

LSA Dean Andrew Martin, who 

introduced Costolo to the crowd 
of hundreds, proclaimed at the 
lecture’s start, “What a great day to 
be a Wolverine!”

Costolo said in his speech he 

aimed to inspire and highlight 
the merit of a liberal arts degree, 
which he said can be viewed as 
“impractical” in Silicon Valley. He 
disputed this opinion by explaining 
how his LSA education fueled his 
leadership skills and broadened his 
understanding of the world.

“A broad liberal arts degree, and 

deep immersion in the humanities 
is actually vital to developing 
our very best leaders and in fact 
without that education, none of 
you would develop the habits of 
mind, and frameworks for creative 
synthesis and lateral thinking, that 
really make the very best leaders in 
the world,” he said.

Costolo said he believes great 

leaders 
possess 
five 
speccific 

qualities: They make decisions 
rapidly and adapt to dynamic 
environments when there are no 
road maps or obvious choices; 
they 
creatively 
synthesize 

information and provide context 

for decisions that are to be made 
across disciplines, cultures and 
perspectives; they inspire and 
build trust in any collaborative 
environment 
by 
welcoming 

viewpoints different than their 
own; they are never in reaction; 
they are kind without being weak 
and 
confident 
without 
being 

“jerks.”

But to achieve these attributes 

of a leader, Costolo said their 
education is key.

“They need to have a few habits 

of 
mind 
uniquely 
developed 

through 
deep 
curiosity

Vocal instructor’s 

mentorship 

supported diversity 

on campus

By CAMY METWALLY

Daily Staff Reporter

Dozens gathered in the School of 

Music, Theatre & Dance’s Stamps 
Auditorium on Thursday night 
to commemorate George Shirley, 
University emeritus professor of 
voice, as the recipient of the 2016 
Shirley Verrett Award.

Established in 2011, the Women 

of Color in the Academy Project 
presents the annual award, which 
includes a $5,000 stipend, to a 
University faculty member whose 
work supports the success of 
female students and faculty in 
the arts who come from diverse 
backgrounds. 
The 
Women 
of 

Color in the Academy Project is 
a campus-wide faculty network 
that provides support for the 
development of scholars who are 
women of color.

Attendees at Thursday’s event 

included 
community 
members 

from 
Shirley’s 
hometown 
of 

Detroit and a number of current 
students and colleagues.

“Music feeds my soul,” Shirley 

said. “It feeds my spirit, and to 
share this moment with people, 
some of whom I don’t know, many 
of whom I do, it’s indescribably 
delicious.”

Opera singer Marcia Porter 

performed 
at 
the 
ceremony 

followed by a performance by 
one of Shirley’s current students, 
School of Music, Theatre & Dance 
graduate 
student 
Kaswanna 

Kanyinda. Her first piece, she 
explained, told the story of a 
person who experienced trials and 
tribulations while working toward 
a goal, and the second song was 
about how the individual became 
lost to the world after reaching 
that goal.

Kanyinda celebrated Shirley 

through song, attributing many of 
her successes and accomplishments 
to his instruction.

“He helped me to understand 

that music isn’t about perfection,” 
Kanyinda said. “It’s about sharing 
who you are, what you’ve been 
through and who you could 
be through song. I know that I 
wouldn’t be on this path, and I 
know I wouldn’t have achieved 
what I have without this man’s 
guidance.”

School of Music, Theatre & 

Dance graduate student Dorian 
Dillard II also attended the 
ceremony 
to 
honor 
Shirley’s 

mentorship. He said he met Shirley 
in 2011 when he won second place 
in the first George Shirley African 
American Art Song and Operatic 
Aria Competition. Since then, 
Dillard said, Shirley has served as 
a mentor and father figure to him 
and others.

“It’s an honor to be in the 

presence of a legend,” Dillard said.

Program strives 

to increase 

health options in 

Southeast Michigan

By DESIREE CHEW

Daily Staff Reporter

This 
summer, 
Michigan 

Forward in Enhancing Research 
and Community Equity will 
launch 
the 
Health 
Access 

Initiative, 
a 
free 
quality-

improvement program for clinics 
and health centers in Southeast 
Michigan aimed at providing 
better care for LGBTQ youth.

MFierce 
was 
founded 
in 

September 2014 with the aim 
of dealing with societal health 
disparities via a participatory, 
community-based approach of 
structural change. It is funded by 
the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention.

MFierce 
Project 
Director 

Triana Kazaleh Sirdenis said the 
organization focuses on systemic 
problems rather than individual 
interventions.

“Besides being participatory, 

the other part that makes MFierce 
different is that it is involved 

with structural change,” Sirdenis 
said. “Currently there are a lot of 
programs focused on changing 
individual behavior, for example 
how to use a condom, how to 
have safer sex negotiations — but 
these are more on the person-to-
person level.”

“So this structural change 

works to impact the bigger 
systems and policies, as well 
as take into account existing 
policies that could be affecting 
quality of care,” she added.

MFierce 
is 
a 
three-part 

coalition, according to Sirdenis. 
The first entity is the steering 
committee, composed of different 
community leaders, CEOs, AIDS 
service organizations, LGBTQ 
groups, state and county health 
departments. Also involved are 
public health researchers in the 
Center for Sexuality and Health 
Disparities, 
or 
the 
SexLab. 

The final piece is the Youth 
Advisory Board, which is made 
up of LGBTQ youth from all over 
Southeast Michigan.

Marcos 
Carrillo, 
biology 

junior at Henry Ford Community 
College, is a member of the 
Youth Advisory Board. He said 
his decision to join MFierce was 
deeply motivated by personal

Frontrunner 
candidate took 

several risks in first 

caucus state

By EMMA KINERY

Daily News Editor

In a speech before his loss 

at the Iowa caucuses Monday, 
Donald Trump said he felt 
“guilty” about not spending 

enough money in the state.

“I’m self-funding my own 

campaign, it’s my money,” 
Trump said. “So far I have 
spent very little money, very 
little. I need to start spending 
for two reasons: Number one, 
I feel guilty. Number two, I 
don’t want to take a chance.”

At the time, Trump used 

his guilt as a jab, ascribing 
it to his then-success in the 
polls over other candidates, 
namely Jeb Bush, who spent 
significant amounts of money 

in the state without seeing 
correspondingly 
large 
poll 

numbers. But, by spending 
little in Iowa Trump had 
already taken a chance — 
one that may now lead to a 
different kind of guilt down 
the road. 

The erstwhile frontrunner 

in the Republican race for 
the presidential nomination 
took several risks in Iowa, 
including not showing up to 
a debate — and for the most

Professor discusses 

Western ideals 
in relation to 
Islamophobia

By AUSTIN HIYAMA

For the Daily

History 
Prof. 
Juan 
Cole 

examined the rise of Islamophobia 
in the Western world in response 
to recent waves of anti-Muslim 
sentiment following a series of 
attacks 
attributed 
to 
Islamic 

extremists. At the event, which 
was attended by about 50 students 
and hosted by the University’s 
Muslim Students’ Association, 
Cole kicked off the talk by 
defining the “American identity.” 
The identity, he said, truly began 
with the idea of manifest destiny 
— an ideology asserting that 
Americans in the 19th century 
were destined to expand the 
United States to the Western coast 
— and the subsequent expansion 
into Western frontier. He also 
said he felt the centrality of the 
frontier in America’s identity was 
responsible for the centrality of 
the military.

immersion in the humanities and 
liberal arts,” he said.

The 
three 
habits 
Costolo 

outlined were creative synthesis, 
disciplined 
thinking 
and 

awareness beyond oneself — all of 
which can be attained through a 
liberal arts education.

To exemplify the importance 

of creative synthesis, Costolo used 
an example from his career in 
which he gave a speech that was 
streamed to the 4,000 Twitter 
employees around the world. 
It in, he showed the famous 
Michelangelo 
sculpture 
that 

depicted the biblical story of David 
and Goliath and emphasized the 
sculpture’s intense gaze to inspire 
employees and inspire mental 

toughness and focus in the face of 
external distractions.

He said this speech helped his 

team by providing “tremendously 
vivid 
context” 
for 
what 
is 

otherwise 
an 
abstraction 

for people, and it creatively 
synthesized simple but powerful 
imagery from one domain into a 
frame of reference to another one 
that was easily understandable.

In 
discussing 
disciplined 

thinking, Costolo said the poetry 
he analyzed in his LSA curriculum 
taught him to synthesize what 
was happening in environments 
that he didn’t initially understand.

“It helps me solve puzzles,” 

he said. “It helps me look for 
clues that I might not recognize 
initially from previous patterns. 
And I think poetry is an example 
of learning to understand the 
context of some peculiar or unique 

situations.”

In his experiences, he said 

he’s found that as a leader one is 
constantly navigating grey areas, 
and making hundreds of decisions 
every day that have ethical 
challenges and winners and losers 
on both sides.

“Nothing prepares you for the 

decisions of this world better 
than the ability to contextualize 
everything about an environment 
that you’re in and the people and 
cultures and psychology and 
history of everyone involved,” 
Costolo said.

Costolo also talked about the 

importance of the awareness 
beyond the self, and how studying 
the humanities allows people to 
be conscious of the biases and 
preconditions of any situation.

“You will jump to fewer 

conclusions 
without 
first 

understanding the entirety of 
the landscape, and you will be 
better equipped to communicate 
decisions that you’ve made in a way 
that transcends the boundaries of 
culture and of politics and even of 
language,” he said.

There were a wide variety of 

University faculty, alumni and 
students at the event. 

Engineering freshman Robbie 

Greenberg said he was curious 
to see how Costolo could inspire 
him, regardless of the fact that 
he is not pursuing a liberal arts 
degree.

“It is incredible to see what 

Michigan alumni have done with 
themselves,” he said. “He became 
the CEO of a major technology 
company that I use in my daily 
life. So I want to see if he can give 
me any ideas of what I want to do 
with my life.”

City sustainability panel talks 
new waste reduction practices

Businesses, University 
discuss environmental 

reforms

By MADELEINE GERSON

For the Daily

The Ann Arbor District Library 

and the city of Ann Arbor held 
their fifth annual sustainability 
forum 
Thursday 
night. 
Fifty 

members 
of 
the 
community 

gathered to listen to an array 
of speakers, including Rodger 
Bowser, the managing partner of 
Zingerman’s Delicatessen, Eileen 
Spring, president and CEO of Food 
Gatherers, a food rescue and food 
bank program serving Washtenaw 
County, Noelle Bowman, solid 
waste 
program 
specialist 
of 

Washtenaw County and Tracy 
Artley, Sustainability Programs 
coordinator 
of 
the 
University 

of Michigan Plant Building and 

Ground Services.

Matt Naud, the environmental 

coordinator of the city of Ann Arbor 
who facilitated the discussion, said 
he believes Ann Arbor has exhibited 
progress in initiating programs 
promoting sustainability. He also 
noted issues the city is working to 
address including the frequency 
of recycling, compost and the 
promotion of waste reduction.

Bowman explained the role of 

waste reduction in managing the 
city’s resources, an issue he said 
is specifically exemplified by the 
excess use of plastic bags.

“Plastic bags rank number four 

as the most common item found in 
litter surveys around the country,” 
Bowman said. “To manufacture 
these materials, about 11 barrels 
of oil are required per ton of bags 
manufactured.”

Bowman added that plastic 

bag disposal not only negatively 
impacts the appearance a city but 
also presents a threat to wildlife.

“The harm to wildlife has been 

devastating,” Bowman said. “That 
begs the question: Do we want to 
be a community that contributes to 
this negative environment?”

Artley brought the discussion 

back 
to 
campus, 
citing 
the 

University’s goal to reduce their 
waste by 40 percent from the 
numbers in 2006 by 2025.

Current 
University 
projects, 

Artley said, include a waste bin and 
labeling standardization effort, 
expansion of composting and zero-
waste events.

Bowser 
described 
a 
few 

sustainable 
practices 
used 
at 

Zingerman’s Deli, including its 
continuous push for composting 
practices as well as purchasing 
store 
supplies 
in 
bulk 
when 

possible.

“Every single disposable that we 

buy is either recyclable, reusable or 
compostable,” Bowser said.

Spring 
also 
discussed 
the 

efforts of her organization, Food 

Gatherers.

“When we started we had a 

dual mission of food rescue and 
hunger relief. We rescue food 
from retailers, primarily grocery 
stores,” said Spring.

The sustainability forum is one 

of several events in the annual 
Sustainable Ann Arbor series. 
The goal of the program was to 
join 
representatives 
from 
the 

community with the public in order 
to provide information to residents 
about how to live more sustainably.

The 
panel 
concluded 
with 

a question and answer session 
during which members of the Ann 
Arbor community presented their 
thoughts and concerns.

Clark McCall, a resident of Ann 

Arbor, suggested the city provide 
compost services throughout the 
entire year, rather than between 
December and April.

“We haven’t had compost pick-

up in the city for that long, maybe 
a couple years,” McCall said. “Ann 
Arbor is an affluent community 
with forward-thinking people. We 
have a responsibility to set the pace 
for other communities.”

Wayne Appleyard, chair of 

the city’s Energy Commission, 
attended 
the 
sustainability 

forum and shared his thoughts 
on the importance of addressing 
sustainability in Ann Arbor.

“We all need to do our part 

to reduce the impact on the 
planet,” Appleyard said. “We have 
overreached the carrying capacity 
of the planet so we need to make 
changes so our daughters and 
granddaughters can have as nice of 
a life as we do.”

MATT VAILLIENCOURT/Daily

Noelle Bowman, solid waste specialist for Washtenaw County, joined community business leaders who gave presenta-
tions and answered questions from the public on the topic of sustainability at the Ann Arbor District Library on Thursday.


part, they might not have paid 
off, as evidenced by his second 
place finish in a state he was 
projected to win. In contrast, 
his opponent, Sen. Ted Cruz 
(R–Texas) at his rally in Iowa 
City the day before spent his 
time portraying himself as 
a true conservative, evoking 
time-tested symbols like the 
Bible and the Constitution.

For Iowa though, where, 

according to NPR, 53 percent of 
voters consider religion “very 
important” and where more 
Evangelical voters participated 
than anticipated, Cruz’s morals 
emphasis was more appealing. 
The candidate won the state’s 
caucus with 27.6 percent of 
votes. 
Trump 
took 
second 

carrying 24.3 percent.

In 
addition 
to 
not 

campaigning as much as his 
opponents, 
Trump 
refused 

to attend the last Republican 
debate a mere two days before 
the caucus, following tension 
with moderator Megyn Kelly 
stemming 
from 
the 
first 

Republican debate in August 
where he said he felt she did not 
treat him fairly.

At the rally, Trump said he 

believed had he attended the 
debate, it would have had its 
highest ratings ever.

“You have to stick up for your 

rights in life,” Trump said. “I 
wanted to debate so badly the 
other night. I wanted to go back. 

But when people don’t treat you 
properly, just like when people 
don’t treat our country properly 
… We would’ve broken the 
(rating) record that night, but 
we did the right thing. Frankly, 
Fox is great. We’re back, we’re 
friends, all of that stuff, but 
I said I’m not going into that 
debate.”

Instead of debating, Trump 

held a rally for veterans that 
night and said he raised $6 
million.

At the time, Trump said 

his absence from the debate 
showed how strong of a leader 
he is, versus Cruz, whom he 
has called a “puppet” and a 
“nervous wreck.” His rally 
was 
comparatively 
more 

policy-focused than Cruz, who 
focused on building up his 
character at his rally and whose 
expressed policy platform was 
largely focused on dismantling 
Obama administration policies.

Aaron Kall, director of the 

Michigan 
Debate 
Program 

and an expert on presidential 
debates, said missing the debate 
because of his feud with Kelly 
only hurt him instead of making 
him look strong as Trump said 
it would.

“It made him look weak,” 

Kall said. “That he wouldn’t 
attend a debate because of a 
conflict with a moderator kind 
of showed that he had poor 
negotiating skills because he 
tried to get the moderator 
excluded and when Fox news 
decided to stick with her he 
basically was left with no 

choice but to skip the debate. 
And it was just disrespectful for 
the voters of Iowa.”

Kall said the small margin 

between the candidates’ polling 
numbers, and how soon the 
debate was to the caucus, made 
Trump’s choice to skip it even 
riskier.

“The debate was just a few 

days before people made their 
decision and some entrance 
poll data of people right before 
they voted revealed that those 
that decided late in the process, 
just in the last few days, he only 
won a very small percentage 
of — only about 15 percent,” 
Kall said. “Where Rubio and 
Cruz won just about half of 
the overall voters. So, I think it 
definitely hurt him with those 
late deciding voters.”

But after the loss, Trump 

didn’t express any of the guilt 
he had joked about on Sunday 
— after results came in, he 
tweeted he was taking the 
second place in stride. 

However, in a series of 

further tweets, Trump did 
associate the loss with the little 
time he spent campaigning in 
the state. 

That 
kind 
of 
rhetoric 

mirrored the confidence he 
expressed pre-caucus — and 
the kind of confidence that’s 
characterized his campaign. 
On Sunday, Trump said he 
anticipated he would win the 
race so extremely he would

experiences 
of 
stigma 
and 

inadequate 
accessibility 
to 

quality health care, which he saw 
to be outgrowths of the larger 
system.

“Imagine 
facing 
stigma 

every day with your friends and 
family, and just understanding 
that 
changing 
transgender 

perspective is not necessarily 
an individual person’s problem 
but also a structural thing,” 
Carrillo said. “Places that have 
increasing rates of sexually 
transmitted infections (STIs) 
are often the same places where 
people lack access to health 
care because they don’t know 
how to apply for Medicaid, 
or 
service 
providers 
aren’t 

creating a safe environment for 
people who seek help, or money 
isn’t 
going 
toward 
helping 

them. Accessibility is a big 
issue because it is related to a 
lot of other pressures — social, 
economic, psychological.”

Sirdenis said engaging the 

Youth Advisory Board was a 
core part of the organization’s 
programming.

“Often public health programs 

are created in isolation without 
input, 
guidance, 
leadership 

and wisdom from the people 
most impacted by it,” she said. 
“The youths are here to help 
us understand what is going 
on, what they would like to see 
in terms of STI treatment and 
access. They are our reality 
check.”

The Health Access Initiative 

is 
a 
two-part 
engagement 

with 
individual 
clinics 
and 

health centers. The first part is 

cultural humility and cultural 
responsiveness for staff — from 
medical 
personnel 
such 
as 

doctors and nurses to front desk 
and administrative staff. This 
includes equipping them with 
inclusive language and practices 
to serve LGBTQ patients more 
comprehensively.

The second component of 

the HAI is technical assistance, 
which aims to support clinics and 
health centers with creating and 
revising protocol and policies. 
This 
includes 
re-examining 

current 
practices 
and 
other 

aspects of the patient experience 
that could impact quality of 
care. All training and support is 
provided for free.

Sirdenis said conceptualizing 

the Health Access Initiative 
involved significant groundwork 
and 
community 
engagement. 

Twelve town halls throughout 
Southeast 
Michigan 
— 

encompassing Flint, Ypsilanti, 
Ann Arbor and Detroit — were 
conducted 
to 
survey 
public 

opinion 
and 
facilitate 
open 

conversations on how to best 
meet the needs of the population 
of interest.

Jack Andrzejewski, a second-

year Master’s student in the 
School of Public Health, works as 
a research assistant for MFierce. 
Part of his job involves literature 
review and data evaluation. He 
said the program development 
phase was both challenging and 
fulfilling.

“The town halls engaged 

community 
members 
via 

process-oriented activities, to 
gather their input on what they 
felt was important and salient. 
This really helped the coalition 
to 
make 
future 
decisions,” 

Andrzejewski said. “Time is 

always an issue. Community-
engaged participatory approach 
to research requires a lot of time. 
Nonetheless, outcomes are better, 
engagements are better and there 
is more buy-in from community 
members.”

Sirdenis 
emphasized 
the 

efforts devoted to ensuring the 
Health Access Initiative was 
directed at meeting the needs of 
its target population.

“We looked over the data 

gathered by SexLab and talked 
it through with the Youth 
Advisory Board; we asked them 
what they thought, and if the 
research resonated with their 
personal experience,” she said. 
“Using existing data, as well as 
everything else gathered from 
the town hall ideas, we went from 
100 ideas and whittled down to 
two ideas.”

Aside from the Health Access 

Initiative, MFierce is also working 
on the Advocacy Collective, 
aimed at providing advocacy 
and professional development 
training for the Youth Advisory 
Board so that members can go on 
to do consulting work.

Carrillo said he hoped the 

Health Access Initiative would 
ultimately 
affect 
large-scale 

change.

“I think that the cool thing 

about this project is not only 
that we’re hoping to increase 
awareness and reduce STI rates, 
we are also involving institutions 
that would otherwise not be 
involved, 
and 
challenging 

them to consider what they can 
improve, what has been working, 
what hasn’t been working, who 
is being left out and how do we 
make whatever we are doing 
more accessible to people,” he 
said.

“One thing that I always take away 
from George Shirley is to remain 
humble. And know that everybody 
is 
somebody 
and 
everybody 

matters. He’s very humble and 
beyond deserving.”

Olwyn Shirley, George Shirley’s 

daughter, attended the event as 
well. With pride, she said he has 
always had many children: his 
students. He showed the same 
attention and devotion to his 
students as he did to her and her 
brother, she said.

“His door is always open,” 

Shirley said. “They come to the 
house, he hosts parties for them, he 
encourages them, and I watch him 
and I feel so blessed to have him.”

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily following the 
ceremony, Shirley said the most 
important advice he’d like to 
impart on his students is to enjoy 
the 
challenge 
of 
expressing 

themselves through music. He 
described this gift of expression as 
a public service that should never 
be taken lightly.

“You’re serving the composer, 

you’re serving the poet, you’re 
serving the public,” Shirley said. 

“It’s a kind of public service that is 
blessed.”

Shirley 
announced 
during 

his speech that he will use his 
monetary prize to fund his George 
Shirley African American Art Song 
and Operatic Aria Competition. 
He said the competition was 
established to encourage the next 
generation of musicians and to 
acknowledge many operatic songs 
written by African American 
composers who are not as widely 
known.

“I want people to know this 

music,” Shirley said. “And the best 
way of doing that is getting young 
people interested in performing 
it, helping them to appreciate it 
and to perform it for people so 
audiences will know more of it.”

Shirley is known internationally 

as an esteemed performer, teacher 
and lecturer. In 2015, President 
Barack 
Obama 
awarded 
him 

the National Medal of Arts, the 
nation’s highest public artistic 
honor. He has performed in more 
than 80 operatic roles throughout 
his career and won a Grammy 
Award in 1968 for one of his roles.

Although 
Shirley’s 
name 

is prominent in the global art 
community, he has also remained 
loyal to his Michigan roots, as 
evidenced by the large number of 

attendees from his hometown of 
Detroit. Detroit natives Stephanie 
Donaldson and Reverend Barbara 
Kelley came in support of Shirley, 
explaining that they attended 
the same church as him in their 
youth.

While 
he 
was 
studying 

music education at Wayne State 
University, Shirley found the 
time to start and conduct the first 
chancellor choir in the People’s 
Community Church. 

“I’ve had occasion to attend 

some 
of 
his 
performances, 

operatic performances, and he’s 
just a wonderful human being,” 
Kelley said. “He’s a hero for me.”

Shirley 
said 
his 
life 
has 

revolved around music since his 
mother sang to him while she 
was pregnant. He added that 
he remembers singing with his 
parents at the age of four, noting 
that his mother had a beautiful 
voice.

“It’s my language,” Shirley 

said. “It’s a language that I believe 
everyone speaks. I’ve always 
known that my life would be 
centered on music in some way. 
So to me, it’s like the air I breathe, 
it’s the food I eat, it’s what makes 
me feel good, it’s the way I express 
myself, it’s a spiritual life force. I’m 
grateful for that.”

DELANEY RYAN/Daily

George Shirley, professor at the School of Music, Theatre and Dance, accepts the Shirley Verrett award, which is given to 
a supporter of women of color in creative arts, at the Stamps Auditorium on Thursday.

“I think there was a 19th 

century sense,” Cole said, “that 
there was turbulence out there 
on the frontier, and it was 
important to the wellbeing of 
the nation that that turbulence 
be dealt with militarily.”

The new frontier of today, 

Cole said, is no longer the 
American Southwest but the 
Middle East. He noted the 
so-called frontier has shifted 
many times in American history, 
encompassing 
groups 
such 

as Native Americans, Roman 
Catholicism, communism and 
still others at different points 
at time.

He then made a point he 

would return to throughout 
the lecture, that there are two 
ways for politicians to motivate 
voters: promising things and 
making them afraid.

Cole said following the Camp 

David Accords of 1978, which 
led to a peace treaty between 
Israel and Egypt, the next 
biggest threat to Israel was Iraq, 
he said. As a result of this threat 
— which Cole noted he felt was 
exaggerated — neoconservative 
groups put pressure on the U.S. 
government to take military 
action against Iraq, culminating 
in Operation Desert Fox, a four-
day bombing campaign in Iraq 
in 1998.

Touching 
on 
terrorist 

groups in the Middle East, 
Cole compared their tactics to 
those of American politicians. 
Groups like ISIS, Cole said, 
are “the mirror image of fear-
mongering in America.” He 
also noted that it was incorrect 
to call such groups “Islamic.” 
While they could be called 
“Muslim” because “Muslim” 
can describe any person of that 
faith, the word “Islamic,” he 
said, is used to describe a set 

of religious ideals with which 
terrorism is not consistent.

When Cole opened up the floor 

to questions, one student asked 
if he thought the prevalence of 
Muslims in professional fields 
like medicine and engineering 
was detrimental to their voice 
in the community, as opposed to 
encouraging Muslims to pursue 
careers in arenas like the media.

“Having only professionals 

is like wearing a muzzle,” Cole 
said in response. “They’re never 
going to ask a doctor about 
Islamophobia.”

LSA freshman Yasmeen Afifi
 

said she felt obligated to come to 
the talk because of her personal 
connection to it.

“I feel like I was sort of 

forced into the political realm 
because of my identity as a 
woman and as a Muslim,” Afifi
 

said. “I basically came here to 
understand more about how 
Islamophobia is manifesting in 
the West.”

I press my hands against the car 

window, watching the fog appear 
and recede along the outlines of my 
fingers.

I’m thinking — overthinking — as I 

often do. My dad glances at me.

“A penny for your thoughts?”
He always says that. I smile. I 

give the usual response: school, 
my future.

It is important to note here my 

dad is deaf, profoundly deaf. He 
proceeds to give me the usual lec-
ture of how difficult it was for him 
to get through school, telling me 
that if he could get by in a world 
that was not made for him, and still 
isn’t, I would be just fine.

He grabs my hand, like he always 

does. I look back out the window and 
begin to wonder.

I often wonder what my life 

would be like if two things had not 
happened: the death of my aunt to 
suicide, and growing up in a deaf 
household. These two things have 
shaped the lenses through which I 
see the world, and my life as it is now 
at the University of Michigan.

What it has also informed me of 

are the things that must change on 
this campus.

If I look back two years ago to my 

freshman year, I find myself failing 
to understand what depression, and 
what mental illness as a whole, is. I 
see myself entering Michigan from a 
highly competitive high school, plac-
ing on myself enormous pressure to 
keep my grades consistent.

If I look closer, despite bouts of 

anxiety, mental health was never 
something talked about in the 
classroom. Even recognizing my 
own mental health seemed wrong 
— when there is no encourage-
ment, no sustained conversation, 
no mention — naturally, these 
things become foreign, almost 
unwanted. 

To me, my anxiety and almost 

sub-human work ethic had left me 
believing that these things were 
necessary in order for me to make 
it. My model of what success was in 
this context was informed by two 
people: my father, who had made 
it against sharp odds to become 
the first deaf dentist in Michigan, 
and my aunt, a Harvard-educated, 
self-made woman teaching con-
stitutional law. Thus, nothing had 
changed my freshman year — in 
fact, things had only gotten worse 
in terms of my anxiety. But, I had 
come out with the grades. Wasn’t 
that all that mattered? I had then 
left for a summer away from Michi-
gan that would change everything.

While my job as a camp counselor 

for the summer was coming to a close, 
I received the news of the death of my 
aunt. A combination of rain and tears 
fell as I stood in the mountains of 
Pennsylvania, so too did my image of 
what I thought my aunt was. Every-
thing that I had desired to be, and 
the picture of what I thought success 
was, shattered instantaneously. For 
someone who I believed had it all to 
be struggling with severe depression 
was unthinkable.

As time continues to pass, the 

questions still remain. And I know I 
will never know the answers.

But what I did know was that men-

tal health was, up until that moment, 
something I had never thought 
about, and as I returned to Michigan 

for a particularly hard year ahead, 
mental health became the first thing 
on my mind.

When I think of mental health, 

two statistics surface. First, the fact 
that one in three college students will 
struggle with depression; second, 
that one’s mental health is the prima-
ry indicator of how we do in college, 
according to the American Psycho-
logical Association. These are statis-
tics that are not without mention due 
to the fact that I have been on Hous-
ing Staff for two years. This opportu-
nity has afforded me the space to be 
vulnerable, and to have real conver-
sations with students about mental 
health in my role as an RA.

It is incorrect to say that most stu-

dents have been given the spaces I 
have to facilitate these conversations; 
it is also incorrect to say that the Uni-
versity, as an institution, promotes 
conversations about mental health. 
When one is expected to be among 
the “leaders and best,” and we are 
valued in a capitalist society for our 
productivity, is it OK to not be on top 
of it all, all of the time?

I carry this frustration with me 

at Michigan, where there are some, 
but not enough, efforts being taken 
to create consistent and meaning-
ful conversations regarding mental 
health as a whole.

If professors announced the first 

day of class that our mental health 

will be the number-one determi-
nant of our performance at this 
University, how many of us would 
be willing to take a look into our-
selves, or into the façade we have 
created as a society, to question 
why mental health isn’t acknowl-
edged as the crucial part of our col-
lege experience that it is? If we are 
truly a campus grounded in reality, 
we must ask why mental health is 
not incorporated into our curricu-
lum? I argue that it should be — and 
one crucial aspect is utilizing the 
classroom as a space to implement 
these conversations.

A student-led initiative that is 

already taking on these and other 
hard questions and searching for 
tangible solutions is the UM Student 
Forums on Campus Climate. These 
student forums will be happen-
ing on two separate occasions this 
week, and I challenge each student 
to attend to shape what Michigan’s 
campus can be.

It is not wrong, nor is it unnec-

essary, to recognize mental health 
problems for what they are: a reality. 
Among our countless conversations 
around inclusivity, we must not for-
get to include something so vital — 
yet so infrequently talked about — on 
this campus. We must work to make 
this campus one that recognizes the 
real, lived-in experiences of all of 
us. It is time for the façade of mental 
health as something superfluous to 
address to fall.

It is time, and it is long overdue, 

that we make this campus a world of 
our own.

The UM Student Forums on Cam-

pus Climate are student-led forums 
that are aiming to address campus cli-
mate issues. This month’s forums will 
focus on issues surrounding identity 
and inclusivity in the classroom set-
ting. Attendees will be able to speak 
openly with their peers about experi-
ences they have had in class that relate 
to social issues and their impact on 
classroom dynamics. From there, stu-
dents will be able to share their ideas 
on and organize around how to make 
their classes safer and more inclu-
sive spaces, specifically for those with 
marginalized identities. Students are 
welcome to attend one (or all) of the 
forums. These events are completely 
student-organized and will be facili-
tated by students as well. The events 
will occur Friday, Feb. 5, 3 p.m. to 4 
p.m. in Couzens Residence Hall, Room 
1413; and Monday, Feb. 8, 7 p.m. to 8:30 
p.m. at Pierpont Commons in the Bou-
levard Room.

L
aast Thursday night, I received a phone call 

from my college roommate. She broke the news 
that a friend of ours who had graduated from 
Michigan with us had died while on a business 
trip. At the ripe age of 27, Adam went to sleep 
and never woke up. Upon hearing this, I was in 
total shock. My entire body went numb. I was 
completely speechless. How could this possi-
bly be true?

Only a month prior, I had seen Adam in 

Chicago. We hadn’t spoken much in the last 
few years, but shared close friends and kept in 
touch through social media. For some reason, 
I went out of my way to see him and catch up 
on this trip. I was there during the week, so I 
met him by his office for a quick coffee. Adam 
was just as upbeat, kind and delightful as I 
remembered him to be in college. He shared 
his hopes and optimism for the future. He was 
supportive of my own creative pursuits. He 
had immense energy, the sunniest disposition 
and the warmest heart. Now, I can’t help but 
replay that conversation in my head, over and 
over again. It’s as if our meeting was yesterday, 
and I can’t seem to erase his words and face 
from my mind.

After receiving the phone call, I reached 

out to other close friends, sharing the terrible 
news. All of us were stunned. How does this 
happen to someone so young? How does this 
happen to someone so great?

Later, three of us talked on the phone. No 

one knew what to say or how to feel. Most of us 
hadn’t spoken to Adam since college four and a 
half years ago. One friend said Adam, or “Alo,” 
as our friends called him in college, would 
want us to celebrate his life; he wouldn’t want 
us to be so heartbroken over his loss.

We began sharing stories and reliving funny 

and ridiculous college memories Alo was a 
part of. After all, we shared four years of frat 
parties, football pregames and some hookups 
with this or that person. Our cries mixed with 
laughter as we remembered the joyful, ambi-
tious Adam we all knew and loved.

You see, Adam wasn’t your average guy. 

With some 6,000 people in the class of 2011 at 
the University of Michigan, Adam managed 
to stand out. He was involved in more extra-
curricular activities than most of us. He was 
an LSA representative, a campus tour guide 
and even a Move-In Maker. He was presi-
dent of AEPi and started a tutoring program 
called Letters to Success, in which Greek life 
members tutored kids in Detroit. While all of 
our futures were unclear, one thing was cer-
tain: Adam was bound for a bright, successful 
adult life.

After college as an outsider looking in, it felt 

like he was the king of Chicago. I, like many of 
our peers, followed his post-grad life through 
his well-crafted Instagrams of cappuccinos at 
hip coffee shops and his well-written, thought-
provoking and insightful posts on his blog, A 
Brewing Thought, as well as ones he shared on 
Medium and The Huffington Post.

When I awoke the next morning, the harsh 

reality that this special person was really gone 
set in. I told myself it must be a joke and then 
remembered that he’s really no longer here. 

My eyes swelled up, my lips went numb and I 
forced myself to hold back tears. Since hear-
ing the news, time feels like it’s moving slower 
than a snail’s pace. Everything feels irrelevant. 
Work, dating, side projects. None of it really 
matters. Nothing seems to relieve this numb-
ness I feel.

Though I didn’t fly to Chicago for Adam’s 

funeral, it doesn’t mean I won’t miss him. It 
doesn’t mean the pain of his passing doesn’t 
hurt like hell.

How do you grieve for someone who wasn’t 

a huge part of your life? How do you make 
sense of the loss?

Since hearing the news, our friends have 

been sharing pictures with Adam from over 
the years: pictures of him as an underclassman, 
wearing maize and blue; later ones of him and 
his friends traveling the world; recent images 
of him as a young professional in his adult 
life. Just a few weeks ago, he was snapped as 
a groomsman in one college friend’s wedding. 
In all of these photos, Adam has a huge grin on 
his face. He was truly a bright light.

People I haven’t heard from since college 

have reached out to ask what’s happened, to 
express their condolences and sadness over 
this terrible loss. In a way, Adam’s death has 
brought many of us who live halfway across 
the world from each other together again. 
He’s forced some of us who haven’t talked in 
years to take the time to get in touch. Oddly 
enough, I haven’t felt so connected to the 
Michigan community since I threw up my 
cap at the Big House and bid Ann Arbor fare-
well four years ago.

We’ve also been sharing his blog posts, 

like this one about the Boston Marathon 
Bombing. In it, he said, “I suppose that the 
nature of tragedy is such that you hope that 
you’ll never truly become accustomed to 
shock, desensitized to the emotion of pro-
found loss.” We are truly, deeply shocked 
to have lost such a profound person. In the 
coming months, I hope to help organize a 
memorial for Adam, an opportunity for us 
all to get together and relish in the fond 
memories of this wonderful person.

Life is incredibly precious and short. In the 

wake of Adam’s death, let us be reminded of a 
few important things: We must be grateful for 
those, like Adam, who have shaped our lives in 
big ways, no matter the size of the friendship. 
We should strive to be as kind, selfless and 
hardworking as Alo. We should cherish the 
Michigan community, despite different time 
zones, zip codes and geographical distances. 
And as his best friend, Sam, shared on Face-
book, we must remember “…to always hold the 
ones you love a little closer than you think you 
need to.”

Thank you for touching our lives in so many 

ways, Adam. While you may no longer be here, 
we will never, ever forget you.

As he once wrote, “We need to carry on, 

through the darkness, without turning.”

Alo, thank you for reminding us to forever 

go blue.

nal World of Defense Intellectu-
als,” and describes how Cohn spent 
a year living among nuclear strate-
gists. Ahearn notes that in this com-
munity, “(Cohn) was required to 
learn a new way of speaking — lots 
of acronyms for types of missiles, 
for example, and many euphemisms 
and abstractions for describing 
nuclear war.” Like babies, Cohn 
picked up on how, through speech, 
she had become a competent mem-
ber of the group. She found this new 
way of speaking seemed to rewire 
her brain. For example, instead of 
people, weapons were most com-
monly the subjects of her sentences. 

Different languages and lan-

guage styles work in different 
ways. The problem is not learning 
something new, but what you leave 
behind.

I read on: “Cohn reports that in 

order to be taken seriously in this 
social and intellectual environ-
ment, she had to learn how to speak 
this ‘technostrategic’ discourse — 
but as soon as she did, she found 
herself at first unable to articulate 
her anti-nuclear sentiments, and 
then, frighteningly, unable even to 

think about her anti-nuclear opin-
ions.”

Here at the University of Michi-

gan, while many of us are not going 
to be in direct contact with nuclear 
technology and therefore will not 
learn that specific language, we all 
change how we speak in order to 
better fit the environment. When 
one speaks to fit a specific environ-
ment, it is called “code-switching.” 
However, when people change 
their thoughts to fit into a different 
language or style of speech, their 
thoughts are limited as Cohn’s was 
among the nuclear scientists. When 
one feels forced to express oneself 
in a way that may not even allow 
their true thoughts, something 
about that situation seems poten-
tially dangerous.

In high school, we learned there 

was one specific way to write an 
essay, an exact formula to get an 
idea across effectively. There was 
a recipe to any persuasive essay: 
introduction, evidence, evidence, 
evidence, counter-argument and 
conclusion (make sure you restate 
your thesis). College application 
essays should be done a proper way: 
Make sure you show who you are, 
but not too much of who you are. 
Make sure to use proper language, 
language that makes you seem like 
a fit candidate for academic life.

The University is no excep-

tion to the afflictions of society 
— the homogenizing of language 
undoubtedly limits the sharing of 
ideas on our own campus. We all 
begin thinking quite uniquely and 
change to fit whatever society we 
belong to — in our case, the Uni-
versity of Michigan — and so we 
cannot tell where our current ideas 
lack.

Together, the ideas of social sci-

entists Franz Boas, Edward Sapir 
and Benjamin Lee Whorf have been 
combined into a commonly known, 
though not formally recognized, 
hypothesis that states: Language, 

thought and culture are a triad 
of concepts. Language influences 
culture and culture influences lan-
guage. Both culture and language 
influence and are influenced by 
thought.

Here at the University, in par-

ticular, smaller discussions or 
seminar-oriented classes, I feel 
as if I cannot speak how I speak, 
but instead, I think over each of 
my ideas, changing them to effec-
tively fit into an “academic-wor-
thy” style. I think in long, varied 
strings, like two infinite roads 
that fork in opposite directions. 
Because of this, it takes me a while 
to form a concrete thought, an idea 
that will easily make sense to my 
peers. It doesn’t translate, and so 
I always miss my chance of being 
relevant, and am left wondering 
how what I had to say may have 
changed the conversation. How do 
we fix this learning environment 
where only one type of conversa-
tion — one that is fixed, fast-mov-
ing and loud — can thrive?

I can see where some may think 

this must be solved first by our 
country’s entire education system 
— that our educators need to teach 
us how to fix this. While I agree 
that this problem is bigger than 
us, it is also bigger than education. 
It is the cultural construct; our 
culture and society expect us to 
behave and learn and express our-
selves in a very specific way. And 
so we do.

I am tired of being afraid that 

my voice — slow, clumsy and with-
out an accent of academia — will 
not be taken seriously (not to men-
tion that my participation grades 
are paying a cost). The only sug-
gestion I can offer: Let’s just start 
talking like ourselves. In time, my 
English professor will understand.

Bloc Party’s ‘Hymns’ 
simple and soothing

By DANIELLE IMMERMAN

Daily Arts Writer

Before indie-rock Tumblr girls 

obsessed over Arctic Monkeys, 
there was Bloc Party. Effortless, 
provocative, 
innovative and 
distinct, 
Bloc 

Party 
is 
by 

far my favor-
ite indie-rock 
band. In fact, 
their 
2008 

Intimacy 
was 

my first real 
favorite album 
— they just have a way of mod-
ernizing the gloomy yet beauti-
fully poetic sound of The Smiths 
in a modern and slightly more 
electronic way. Given that my 
love for Bloc Party is still very 
much alive, you can imagine my 
disappointment when I first lis-
tened to Hymns.

I hated it. I thought it was 

basic, try-hard and vaguely remi-
niscent of something I heard 
before. However, I then realized 
that for the past hour I had been 
streaming the wrong album. I 
was, in fact, listening to their 
failed 2012 electronic mess of 
an album, Four. For a solid hour 
I was beside myself — a visible 
pile of tears may or may not have 
surrounded me in the middle 
of Espresso Royale. I couldn’t 
understand why Kele Okereke 
and the rest of Bloc Party went on 
a three-year hiatus and suffered 
through the perils of a lineup 
change, only to came back with a 
sub-par album. I was devastated. 
Confused. Heartbroken. 

Luckily, thanks to iTunes 

(Spotify, you suck), I eventually 
listened to Hymns. Compared to 
Four, Hymns is a drastic improve-

ment as a whole. Inspired by reli-
gious memorabilia found in his 
parents’ home, Okereke attempts 
to make this album a modern day 
religious gospel by masking his 
somewhat religiously fueled lyr-
ics with overpowering instru-
mentals.

Whether you like Bloc Party 

or not, it’s inarguable that their 
sound is unlike any other indie-
rock band’s — they have an ability 
to create their own genre within 
a genre. Yes, it’s indie-rock, but 
it’s more than that. Electronic 
beats overtake each track with 
underlying gospel, jazz and new 
wave elements popping up when 
you least expect it — resulting 
in a sound that, when you hear a 
song playing, can only be identi-
fied as Bloc Party.

This unique sound is pushed 

to its limits in all 15 tracks on 
Hymns. Violins are electronically 
warped, each guitar riff never 
appears to resemble the last and 
Okereke’s DJ sound mixing past 
is put on full display. The listen-
ing experience is never unenjoy-
able, you never want to press next 
and to play Hymns on a loop for 
the rest of time is a distinct pos-
sibility — but this in and of itself 
is a problem.

I can play this album non-stop, 

time and time again and never 
tire of it because it has a way of 
fading into the background. It’s 
noise, but it’s pleasant noise. 
It’s soothing yet predictable. It 
doesn’t stir any emotions in me. 
It doesn’t make me want more 
from Bloc Party.

Fundamentally, the problem 

with Hymns is that the balance 
between sound and lyrics is heav-
ily skewed in favor of sound. For 
example, “Only He Can Heal Me” 
is a catchy song — the distinct 

heartbeat rhythm that overtakes 
the song makes for a great listen, 
but you’re so caught up in the 
the sound that the lyrics easily 
lose when at battle with the beat. 
Much of the album is like this 
— the lyrics fade into the back-
ground of the noise. Only two 
songs really prove otherwise; 
“Into the Earth” and “Exes” both 
lack heavy electronic beats. 

“Into the Earth” is the most 

stripped down song on the 
album — the dominating sound 
is the distinctive guitar chords 
that fluctuate between staccato 
plucks and smooth riffs, a depar-
ture from the mostly electronic 
basis for the album. With less 
going on instrumentally, it’s eas-
ier for Okereke’s lyrics to actu-
ally be heard — the problem is 
that what we hear isn’t anything 
noteworthy.

“Exes” is similar to “Into the 

Earth” in its seemingly simplis-
tic sound — the main focus of 
the song is the lyrics with a mel-
low, smooth backdrop of sound. 
Okereke croons “To all the exes / 
That I left behind / These words 
will fall short / But I must try.” 
This would be a great chorus if it 
weren’t actually true; his words 
do fall short and he barely tries. 
This isn’t to say that this song, or 
any song for that matter, is bad. 
Each song on the album is good 
and different from what other 
bands produce.

The album, as a whole, is a 

pleasant listen, but after you listen 
to each song over and over again, 
everything blurs. Although the 
electronic beats and rhythms are 
unique, Okereke fails to vocally 
and lyrically match each song’s 
distinct instrumentals. The result 
is 15 songs that sound great but 
mean very little.

TV REVIEW
‘The Virgin’ still fun

By DANIELLE YACOBSON

Daily Arts Writer

After 
an 
unbearably 
bleak 

month of attempting to be enter-
tained by real people’s mundane 
drama, 
hear-

ing the words 
“accidentally 
artificially 
inseminated” 
has never felt 
better. “Jane the 
Virgin” is back 
with 
a 
killer 

midseason pre-
miere, 
making 

up for lost time 
with an excep-
tionally hip and 
“in with the gays” Abuela, a guest 
appearance from Glam-ma (Rita 
Moreno, “West Side Story”) and a 
college English class with giants. 
An explanation will follow.

In the telenovela world of drug 

lords and baby kidnappers, the 
badassery that exudes from Gina 
Rodriguez is the only constant. 
The second Latina woman to ever 
win the Golden Globe for Best 
Actress in a TV Comedy, Rodri-
guez (“Filly Brown”) delivers a 
consistently exceptional perfor-
mance as Jane. A single, working 
mom with dreams of a career and 
more on her mind than the next 

guy, Jane shines as one of the most 
inspirational women on television. 
Her one-of-a-kind sense of humor, 
brains and general awesomeness 
are only heightened by her acute 
sensitivity, a characteristic that is 
too often either entirely lacking 
from independent female leads 
or portrayed as their detrimental 
flaw. Instead, Jane’s vulnerability 
is a testament to her strength as 
she unapologetically embraces all 
the emotions that come with rais-
ing a child, starting a career and 
constantly reevaluating the messi-
ness of her love life.

The midseason premiere kicks 

off with the terrifying realiza-
tion that the “Great Books” litera-
ture class that Jane is teaching is 
instead coined “Books for Ballers.” 
A swarm of six-foot athletes (the 
previously 
mentioned 
giants) 

enters. Understandably, a visceral 
reaction to the word “sports” fol-
lows shortly thereafter as Jane has 
traumatic flashbacks to elementa-
ry school gym class. But, in the true 
glass-half-full spirit of Jane Glori-
ana Villanueva, she bravely sacri-
fices the home telenovela reel for 
a sports broadcast in an attempt to 
connect with her students. “Pride 
and Prejudice” is translated into 
“baller” terms as the athletically-
challenged viewers gawk at the 
millionth reason why Jane is the 

coolest person ever.

“Jane the Virgin” constantly 

delivers 
surprising 
character 

development that easily rivals 
the usual melodrama of artificial 
pregnancies and presumed-to-be-
dead-mothers-turned-drug-lords 
— yet another quality that sets the 
show apart from other network 
comedies. Season two begins to 
convince the audience that the 
now very pregnant Petra (Yael 
Grobglas, 
“Jeruzalem”) 
might 

not be the physical manifestation 
of evil after all. Her mistakes, as 
ridiculous as they may be, color the 
misguided “villain” in a weirdly 
relatable way. At the very least, the 
fiery anger sparked by the second 
not-so-accidental 
insemination 

has died into a controllable sizzle. 
For the record, there are now three 
babies, and nobody has had sex.

The midseason premiere was 

light on the Michael-Rafael-
Jane love triangle, but romance 
is inarguably on the horizon for 
the rest of the season. Michael 
might claim he has “moved on” 
with a new girlfriend, but the rest 
of us are definitely not ready to 
let go. Nevertheless, the Villan-
ueva women have a collectively 
long list of suitors, and if there’s 
anything the audience can unani-
mously agree on, it’s that we are 
all #TeamJane. 

ALBUM REVIEW
Your 3 a.m. thoughts

By SHIMA SADAGHIYANI

For the Daily

The Brooklyn-based trio known 

as Wet first turned heads with their 
self-titled, four-track EP in late 
2013. Through 
songs such as 
“Dreams,” “No 
Lie” and “You’re 
the Best,” Wet 
introduced 
a 

sound that was 
organically 
beautiful in its 
simplicity. With 
Kelly Zutrau’s enchanting vocals 
layered perfectly over the sparse 
and muted electronic background, 
it felt like this EP was the begin-
ning of even greater albums to 
come. 

Boy, what a disappointment. 
Wet’s debut 11-track album, 

Don’t You, is the physical embodi-
ment of 3 a.m. thoughts: lonely, 
ambient yet weirdly empty and 
unfocused. The most impactful 
thing this album drops is the idea 
that Kelly Zutrau doesn’t want to 
be your girl anymore (but she’s, 
like, super sad about it). Don’t You 
keeps the same unique sound Wet 
instituted with their EP: breathy 
vocals and an idiosyncratic beat, 
which worked in the short EP 
but causes the much longer Don’t 
You to sound repetitive and dis-
illusioned. All the different ways 
Wet could have developed their 
music further were pushed aside 
somewhere between the years of 
2013 and 2016, leaving Don’t You 
with a set of similar-sounding 
songs scrambling to push past 
superficiality. 

One such song is “Body.” As 

the second-to-last song in the 
album, its slow, churning beat 
would be a serene way to wrap 
up Don’t You — if the same struc-
ture wasn’t repeated at various 
points earlier in the album with 
songs “Move Me” and “Island.” 
At four minutes long, “Body” is 
just exhausting to get through. 
The other songs fare no better. 
The constantly reiterated “call 
me by my real name / say my 
name out loud” in “Move Me” 
loses all meaning in its monoto-
ny, and the slow, mournful bal-
lad “Island” weighs the album 
down with its heaviness. These 
songs, standing alone, are gen-
erally harmonious and pleasant 
to listen to for roughly three to 
four minutes; the problem arises 
when they’re put together in one 
album, as they bore the listener 
with unvaried tones.

However, songs like “Weak” 

and “Small and Silver” redeem 
the album from becoming a com-
plete failure, and they show what 
could’ve been if Wet pushed 
themselves to experiment with 
their sound just a little bit more. 
In “Weak,” the structured “oh 
baby, baby, baby / if you’re leavin’, 
leavin’, leavin’ / you would only, 
only, only / take from me, me, me” 
of the chorus contrasts nicely with 
the more organic verses, making 
the song more engaging. “Small 
and Silver” is exactly what its title 
promises: delicate and innocent, 
yet grounded through the deep 
electronic bass that remains con-
stant through the song.

The one song that has any dif-

ferentiation from the rest of the 

album is the final song, “These 
Days.” Armed with only a soft 
piano melody in the background 
(an extreme divergence from the 
rest of the album’s heavy depen-
dence on a glossy, computerized 
rhythm) Zutrau is almost naked 
as she croons, “today I scare so 
easily / these days I can’t take too 
much.” It’s a deeply personal and 
raw moment for both the band and 
the listeners. And it really shows 
how amazing Wet could be if they 
turned away from trying to make 
all songs fit a particular mold. 

Don’t You finishes with “These 

Days,” and one can only hope 
that it’s as much as a salute to 
new beginnings as it is a conclu-
sion. Even though Wet has mas-
tered creating intimate songs that 
explode with sensuality and sen-
sitivity, they have also mastered 
creating songs that explode with 
similarity. Through their EP, Wet 
had a good base to stand on while 
they augmented their music to 
explore all the different types of 
songs they could create, but they 
just didn’t take the chance. Don’t 
You is unfulfilling in the sense that 
it could have been so much more 
if Wet trusted themselves enough 
to step into unknown territory. 
Instead of an indistinguishable 
blend of homogeneity featuring 
breathy vocals and overly polished 
tempos, perhaps this new album 
would have been an adventure, full 
of spontaneous twists and turns. 

But, hey, Wet is only just get-

ting started. And “These Days” 
showed enough of a glimpse to 
be hopeful that Wet’s next album 
will be as good as what Don’t You 
could have been. 

D

ear Gillian,

It’s not that I have 

trouble making up my 

mind. It’s just that I want to know 
everything before I do. So I am 
incessantly 
reaching out 
for input. I 
have my ther-
apist once a 
week, I see my 
two academic 
advisors every 
other week 
and I com-
municate with 
the teacher 
who mentored 
me in high school almost every 
day. My sister was understanding 
when I was younger, but now she’s 
stopped taking my late night calls. 
I once hired a “life coach” and I’ve 
seen a psychic several times. OK, 
more than several times. Now I’m 
writing to “Dear Gillian.” Is there 
something wrong with wanting a 
lot of input? — Advice Addict

Dear Advice Addict,
OK, let’s embark on this meta 

journey: advice on advice. The 
first thing I did upon reading 
your letter was to consult the 
great Oracle at Delphi. 

The mystical prognostications 

of the Oracle at Delphi held great 
sway in the classical mythology 
and literature of Ancient Greece 
and early Rome. Those of the 
ancient world would come to 
Pythia, the priestess of Apollo, 
for prophecies and questions 
about the future. The Oracle 
touches the lives of towering 
literary figures from the mur-
derous and incestual prophecy 
of Oedipus, (kills his father, 
marries his mother) to the epic 
heroes Achilles and Odysseus. 
The Oracle worked herself up 
into a mystical frenzy in contact-
ing the godly realm to divine her 
prophecy for you. The Oracle 
emerged to offer simply this: “no 
one was wiser than Socrates.” 
So if the psychics weren’t doing 
it for you, maybe sit down with 
a philosophy professor or two 
in Angell Hall. But be careful, 
philosophy tends to answer ques-
tions with questions, as Socrates 
was known to do. This will either 
take your advice addiction to a 
whole ’nother level or it will cure 
you of it for good.

Religions across the globe are 

full of advisors and seers. Proph-
ets in the Abrahamic religions 
serve as middlemen between 
God and mortals, dispensing 
what amounts to advice. Joseph 
interprets his dream to prepare 
the Pharaoh and the Egyptians 
for years of drought and famine. 
For you, Ad, I chose a random 
minor Biblical prophet, figur-
ing he might have time on his 
hands to deal with your situa-
tion. Jonah was asked by God to 

go give advice to the Ninevites 
to repent or be destroyed, but 
he wants nothing to do with it. 
He tries to escape his task, gets 
swallowed by a sea monster and 
saved by God, and then grate-
fully heads to Ninevah, where 
his prophecy saves the day. 
Jonah offers to you this sugges-
tion: “Compare the advice you 
have received with the advice 
you have followed.” I’m not sure 
what this means, but if it helps, 
let me know.

In the Vedas texts and Upani-

shads of Hinduism, we see early 
references to gurus: literal and 
spiritual teachers who counsel 
people, help mold their values 
and help them find the path. In 
the Sikh tradition, Guru Nanak 
drops some hymnal knowl-
edge: “Truth before me, Truth 
throughout Time, Truth here 
and now, Truth is evermore.” Got 
that? All good?

Yoruba priests in Africa imag-

ine two parts of the cosmos: 
“aye,” the visible, tangible world 
of the living and “orun,” the spir-
itual world of the ancestors, gods 
and spirits. The priests commu-
nicate with the spiritual world as 
a source of wisdom and interpret 
the significance of the signs they 
receive for individuals or com-
munities. Listen for the rustling 
of leaves at night because there’s 
truth in the spirits that move 
them.

In the Shakespearean tradi-

tion, soothsayers predict the 
future and serve as dramatic plot 
devices. In “Julius Caesar” the 
soothsayer delivers an omen and 
speaks the badass line: “beware 
the Ides of March.” The charac-
ters don’t pay much attention, 
but the words alert the audi-
ence and raise the question of 
fate. Could it have been altered? 
To you, this same character 
soothsays to “Beware the Ides of 
April,” which is either the date of 
your Econ final or the day your 
tax returns are due — either way, 
solid advice.

By this point, the one thing 

that should be clear is that not 
everyone — and surely not Dear 
Gillian — can be trusted for good 
counsel. Oftentimes people in 
your life have their own interests 
or are so embedded in a societal 
system they can’t give objective 
advice. Your friend who’s tryna 
turn up might not be the best 
advisor on whether you stay in 
and catch up on sleep or go take 
a pickleback at Mash. In Balzac’s 
19th century novel “Le Pere 
Goriot,” Rastignac, a young law 
student from the country, tries 
to tap into Parisian high society. 
He takes advice from corrupt 
neighbors and acquaintances 
who push him toward callous 
social climbing informed by the 
ethos of the city, rather than by 
genuine concern. You ultimately 

have to mediate your intake of 
counsel. 

The early 20th century 

advice scene took a break from 
divinely sourced prophecy and 
was instead an era influenced by 
Freud’s psychoanalysis. Here, 
the objective is not prescriptive 
but analytic: you need to uncover 
repressed elements of your self 
that may help you understand 
your internal desires and deter-
mine what course of action 
suits you best. Inspired by this 
revelatory elevation of the sub-
conscious, Surrealist artists used 
various techniques to bring it 
forth. Exercises such as creating 
an “exquisite corpse” where mul-
tiple artists collaborate on a ren-
dering of a human body, like the 
one done by Yves Tanguy, Joan 
Miro, Max Morise, and Man Ray 
from 1926-27, allowed surrealists 
to transcend the rational mind. 

Martha Graham dug down to 

find the subconscious or “inner 
landscape” embodied in move-
ment. She believed emotions 
not easily expressed by words 
could be communicated through 
dance: contractions and releases. 
Her choreography in “Lamenta-
tion” is rich with emotion and 
the corporeal representation of 
grief. Sometimes your body can 
tell you more than your mind and 
will give you signals to how you 
feel about a certain situation or 
decision.

Not that there’s anything 

wrong with advice, counseling or 
therapy, from whatever trusted 
source. It is time well-spent. 
The reality is that most people 
feel overwhelmed at some point 
and need to vent the anxieties 
of our modern lives where we’re 
blessed with too many oppor-
tunities and too much time for 
self-reflection. Plus without it, 
we wouldn’t have those satiri-
cal Woody Allen scenes or New 
Yorker cartoons. The parodies 
are entertaining, but also com-
forting in a sense.

I’d love to know how your 

modern-day psychics compare 
with the oracles, priests, gurus, 
soothsayers and prophets; but 
friends, sisters, therapists and 
academic advisors can only go 
so far. As I believe the arts are 
the fountainheads of powerful 
wisdom, AA, find a book, film, 
museum exhibit or performance 
that deals in some way with your 
dilemma du jour, and you’ll be 
surprised how the same human 
heartaches recur and recur with 
creative solutions in the archives.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

By LEJLA BAJGORIC

Hip-Hop Columnist

“

Don’t do no press, but I get 
the most press kid.”

The last Michigan Daily 

hip-hop columnist, Adam 
DePollo, wrote his first piece 
on college hip hop with an 
obligatory focus on Kanye and 
the monumental moment that 
was the ’04 release of Dropout. 
Before him, columnist Jack-
son Howard recounted the hip 
hop that set the scene for the 
summer of 2013, making sure 
to include Ye’s “Bound 2” on 
his list of songs that lasted into 
the fall. So I ask, as Killa Cam 
might, who am I to fuck tradi-
tion up? Besides, Kanye just 
makes it too damn easy.

I’ll safely assume that the 

Daily’s readership is composed 
of cultured college students 
who make it a personal duty 
of theirs to stay up to date on 
the world’s current events, lat-
est political scandals and, of 
course, Twitter beefs. (Read: 
You saw the belligerence that 
was Kanye’s Twitter account 
last week, right? Or at least read 
about it before he deleted those 
embarrassing-ass messages 
chock-full of self-absorption 
and sexism? Cool, I figured.) 
Just in case, though, here’s a 
quick refresher to get us going: 
Wiz wasn’t feeling Kanye’s 
album’s name change (initially 
Swish, now Waves). If you’ve 
ever heard someone say “free 
the wave,” you can be 99% sure 
she was referring to Max B, 
the Harlem rapper currently 
serving a 75-year sentence, best 
known for creating the Wave 
sound. This is what upset Wiz: 
Everyone in the (rap) world 
knows the wavy movement is 
associated with Max B, the 
reason he’s lauded and loved, so 
why is Ye biting Biggavelli?

This set the scene, but it was 

a misinterpretation on Kanye’s 
behalf that caused the conflict; 
Wiz was tweeting about his 
weed, known as KK, or Khalifa 
Kush, but in Kanye’s mind, the 

only thing KK could possibly 
refer to is Kim Kardashian. So 
he flipped, called Wiz out for 
being corny, made observations 
about Wiz’s “cool pants” and 
asserted that he is Wiz’s “OG 
and will be respected as such.” 
But it didn’t take long for Ye to 
bring up his ex, the mother to 
Wiz’s child, socially conscious 
SlutWalk-organizer and bald-
headed baddie — Amber Rose. 
“You let a stripper trap for 
you” is point four on a 17-point-
long tirade by Ye. It makes you 
wonder if he really made that 
misinterpretation or if he was 
just looking for a reason to 
talk about Amber. He does it 
an awful lot, every time just as 
uncalled for as the last.

I’m going to refer to this spat 

between Wiz and Ye as a “rap 
beef” just for the sake of the 
argument. The use of women, 
specifically Black women, and 
even more specifically Black 
women who occupy or occu-
pied the role of ex-girlfriend/
lover/etc., as pawns in a conflict 
between two men is pretty 
common in rap. It’s actually 
something like a staple. Think: 
What’s the most famous rap 
diss of all time, and what do you 
hear within the first two sec-
onds, the line that sets the pace 
for the rest of the song, and 
cements the track’s place in rap 
diss history?

“That’s why I fucked your 

bitch, you fat motherfucker.”

Pac was never subtle about 

anything — not about his para-
noia surrounding death, not 
about his views that the gov-
ernment and police were the 
true gangs who ran the country 
and, sure as hell, not about his 
sexism. “Hit ‘Em Up” is the 
most famous track birthed dur-
ing the infamous East Coast/
West Coast rap beef. The open-
ing line is an allusion to Big-
gie Smalls’s wife at the time, 
Faith Evans. “You claim to be a 
player, but I fucked your wife,” 
spits Pac, and we’re not even 
thirty seconds into this shit yet. 
Though Pac makes multiple 

threats aimed at each and every 
member of Bad Boy, threat-
ens to cut up Cease until he’s 
deceased (clever) and “snatch” 
Lil Kim off the streets, the most 
insulting line is the one heard 
first; everything else seems 
like an afterthought. Faith is 
positioned as a pawn, reduced 
to nothing more than a tool Pac 
can use to discredit Biggie on 
all accounts. Simply put: How 
could anything Big say hold 
weight when Pac “fucked (his) 
bitch?” Though Pac claims to 
have been amorously involved 
with Faith, there’s nothing 
romantic 
about their 
supposed rela-
tionship; he 
simply used 
her sexually 
to compro-
mise Biggie’s 
reputation. 
As a means of 
asserting his 
power over 
Big, Pac places 
Faith, a sexual pawn, beneath 
the both of them.

But we don’t have to go back 

20 years to find comparisons. 
There’s a prime case from 
last summer that I know you 
haven’t forgotten yet, no mat-
ter how much we all want to: 
Drizzy vs. Meek, the feud that 
we can safely say Drake won, 
but damn, did he really say 
much outside of all those lines 
referencing Nicki Minaj? Nicki 
and Drake, longtime friends 
and Young Money family, have 
always had a flirty relationship, 
so it’s natural people would 
assume the two were at some 
point romantically involved; 
after all, he took her to a con-
venience store and bought her 
snacks that one time. That’s 
real. But on The Pinkprint’s 
“Only,” Nicki lets it be known, 
loud and clear: “I never fucked 
Wayne, I never fucked Drake 
/ On my life man, fuck’s sake.” 
Instead, she’s been cozied up 
with MMG representer Meek 
Mill for a minute now, and the 

HIP-HOP COLUMN

Women aren’t pawns 

in your beef

two are happily engaged. Know-
ing how longstanding Drake’s 
friendship with Nicki is, you’d 
assume he wouldn’t bring her 
into the beef with Meek; their 
friendship precedes Meek’s 
claims of Drake’s history of 
ghostwriting. Drake is bet-
ter than that, right? Not in the 
slightest.

“And shout out to all my boss 

bitches wifin’ n****s / Make 
sure you hit him with the pre-
nup.”

“Back to Back” was per-

formed at OVO Fest before 
thousands, a screen full of 
memes accompanying Drake’s 
performance and adding to the 
embarrassment. Many of the 
memes feminized Meek, illus-
trating him in dresses and Nicki 
in suits; Meek’s in a relationship 
with a woman who has built 
an empire around her name, 
which is to say she’s making 
more money than him. Like, a 
lot more. Like, her net worth is 
more than 20 times Meek’s. But 

the breadwin-
ner in the States 
is tradition-
ally male, as 
is the case in 
any patriarchy; 
thus, whoever is 
financially sub-
ordinate occu-
pies the “wife” 
role, regardless 
of gender, as 
is implied by 

Drake. And in a capitalist soci-
ety, if you’re financially subor-
dinate, you’re actually worth 
less — I’m speaking about your 
humanity here. Keep this point 
about class in mind. Nonethe-
less, the main point here is that 
once again the easiest and most 
hurtful way to diss a dude is 
to bring his girl into the mix, 
reduce her to a instrument and 
if you can somehow incorporate 
financial status, definitely do 
so, since cash rules everything 
around us.

“You let a stripper trap for 

you.”

Sex-shaming isn’t cool, 

never was, never will be, but 
it’s fascinating that Kanye has 
the audacity to shame Amber’s 
history as a sex worker while 
praising Kim as the Marilyn 
Monroe of our generation. Both 
figures — Kim and Marilyn — 
are regarded as sex symbols, 
Kim specifically entering main-
stream popular culture dis-
course through an appearance 
in a sex tape. I mean, the tape 

was leaked, but Kim still struts 
her stuff every chance she gets. 
And this isn’t said to shame 
Kim. I’m all for bodily autonomy 
(as I hope you are too). It’s sad 
to point out the cognitive dis-
sonance it seems Ye is dealing 
with, since he knows Kim’s suc-
cess is strongly associated with 
her sexuality: “My girl a super-
star all from a home movie.”

But there’s a difference 

between how certain acts 
or occupations, all sexual in 
nature, are understood based 
on differences in race and 
class. For example, burlesque 
vs. stripping. The two differ 
in compensation, in historical 
elements and some performance 
ones as well — burlesque being 
viewed as a performance piece 
that doesn’t necessarily involve 
direct engagement with the 
audience. But race and class 
can’t be factored out of the 
equation and are intimately 
woven into the difference in 
perception between high-
class, sophisticated burlesque 
performers and “ratchet,” 
for everybody strippers. It’s 
important to incorporate race 
and class dynamics when we 
discuss sexism, and that’s really 
the common thread here — 
the domination of women, or 
sexism.

How do we talk about sex-

ism in hip hop? There’s a few 
options here, and most suck, 
but hopefully the good one (I 
saved it for last) can help us out 
when the next rap beef ensues 
and someone’s baby mother is 
unnecessarily mentioned, gross-
ly demeaned and nonchalantly 
objectified.

Option one: adopt an anti-hip 

hop stance, because if hip hop 
goes away, then sexism in hip 
hop goes away too by default. 
My vote here is no. For one 
thing, by erasing all hip hop, 
we’re erasing the good stuff 
too — the politically charged, 
radical and rebellious, uplift-
ing and liberating stuff. And 
that’s uplifting and liberating 
for women too. “So preserve 
the Golden Age tapes and just 
get rid of contemporary rap,” 
you might be thinking. Still no. 
“Fight the Power” was more 
than a song; it was an anthem, 
I agree. But present day art-
ists have proven to have the 
same capacity to make pow-
erful music, music that calls 
for reflections on excessive 
consumption, for the sexual 
liberation of women, for the dis-

mantling of white supremacy. 
The real issue with this stance 
is that it is often tinged with 
conservative rhetoric, anti-
Black at its core, blaming rap’s 
content for societal issues at 
large and the decline in Ameri-
can society. Essentially, it uses 
hip hop as a racially charged 
scapegoat, and I hope I don’t 
have to explain why that’s 
wrong.

Option two: if the issue (sex-

ism) isn’t a product of hip hop, 
then leave it be and address it at 
its core instead. This is better, 
but still no. Sexism predates hip 
hop culture, but the issue with 
sexism, as is the issue with any 
systemic form of oppression that 
permeates all facets — media, 
government, you name it — of 
society is that any fight against 
it is “necessarily partial and 
incomplete.” Tricia Rose elabo-
rates on this in “The Hip Hop 
Wars” (I know I mentioned the 
text in my last column too, this 
is the last time I promise, I just 
really want you to read it), but 
the takeaway is we’d be doing 
ourselves a disservice. Sexism is 
everywhere, yes, but that means 
it must be fought on all fronts, 
including and especially hip hop 
— the dominant music of our 
time, a primary means through 
which we’re socialized.

Option three: come to terms 

with the fact that most sex-
ism in rap isn’t an articulation 
of what rappers observe, but 
instead is a reinforcement of 
those observations, and hold 
rappers, as you should hold 
anyone, accountable. Winner, 
winner. This attack on sexism 
must not be of the religious 
kind — encouraging women to 
dress and act modestly, submis-
sively, as a means of avoiding 
degradation. Basically “don’t 
act like a hoe and you won’t be 
called one” — inherently flawed, 
oppressive logic. And the attack 
also must not be anti-Black-
youth, pinning the plights of 
our time on the most marginal-
ized peoples. Only a progressive 
engagement that successfully 
avoids the aforementioned traps 
can do hip hop any good, and as 
sexism is found virtually every-
where, a synchronized and sim-
ilarly structured engagement in 
other arenas is the only thing 
that can do us all some good.

STYLE NOTEBOOK
The hip hijab 

By MARIAM SHEIKH

Daily Style Editor

This year Dolce & Gabbana 

joined the ranks of innovative 
fashion designers by creating a 
line of designer couture hijabs 
and abayas. Muslim girls and 
women in hijabs, including those 
in full abayas, are often the most 
stylish ones of my friends, family 
and peers so it’s great to see the 
fashion industry finally catering 
to these women, who undeniably 
make up a significant portion of 
their market from shoes, to bags, 
all the way down to jewelry. 

Other retailers, like H&M and 

DKNY, have also been notable 
in the past year for catering to 
Muslim women in their use of 
hijab-wearing models. In sum-
mer 2014, DKNY launched a 
collection specifically catered 
to 
“Muslim-friendly” 
cloth-

ing for the month of Ramadan. 
For anyone, fashion choices and 
style are a huge part in express-
ing self-identity. For women who 
choose to proudly sport a hijab 
or an abaya, it’s an intrinsic part 
of their self-expression, so why 
shouldn’t they be given as many 
options as the rest of us are when 
shopping at our favorite stores?

Debuting 
intrinsically 
pat-

terned hijabs, as well as detailed 
lace and embroidered abayas, 
Dolce & Gabbana has taken that 
step in allowing more women to 
be themselves, and to do so fash-
ionably in their own right. In fact, 
while the collection is catered 
toward women who wear hijabs 
or abayas, any woman would be 
lucky to be able to wear the rich, 
long-flowing dresses that exhibit 
both classic elegance and style.

While D&G has opened the 

gates for more high-fashion 
houses to follow in example, 

not all people can afford or are 
understandably willing to spend 
that much on any item of cloth-
ing. So what about everyone 
else? It is time that more every-
day ready-to-wear retailers start 
embracing these broader fashion 
needs. I can go to the mall tomor-
row and find an outfit for any 
type of personality, age or fash-
ion sense, so why should Muslim 
women not be catered to as well?

Taking true pride and putting 

conscious thought into what they 
wear and how they wear it, Mus-
lim women — those wearing a 
hijab, abaya or none at all — often 
find it hard to reconcile dressing 
fashionably with dressing mod-
estly. Especially in today’s soci-
ety where “less is more” seems 
to be the ongoing trend amongst 
millennials around the world.

By no means is the Dolce & Gab-

bana collection perfect; in fact, 
there have been many issues with 
the marketing of the line in gen-
eral. Debuting the designer hijabs 
with non-Muslim, white models 
definitely hovers over the line of 
cultural and religious appropria-
tion. It also leaves Muslim women 
for whom the line was tailored a bit 
excluded.

So, no, it’s not perfect, but I guess 

in the midst of a society wracked 
by Islamophobia and the ignorant 
rants of Donald Trump threaten-
ing a ban on Muslims, it’s not only 
comforting, but crucial, to see com-
panies and designers embracing 
both the hijab and the abaya.

Comforting and 

crucial.

How do we talk 
about sexism in 
hip hop? Most 
options suck.

‘Jane Got a Gun’ 
is a sappy failure

Natalie Portman’s 
romantic Western 
is shooting blanks

By MADELEINE GAUDIN

Daily Arts Writer

“Jane Got a Gun,” but she 

doesn’t really use it. Natalie 
Portman’s (“Black Swan”) lat-
est film has so 
much potential 
to be a badass 
reversal 
of 

traditional 
Western 
gen-

der roles, but 
it loses itself 
somewhere 
along the way.

Portman 

plays the titu-
lar character seeking revenge 
against the band of outlaws 
known as the Bishop Boys, who 
want her and her husband Bill 
Hammond 
(Noah 
Emmerich, 

“Pride and Glory”) dead. When 
they send Hammond home alive 
but full of bullets, she calls on the 
help of her ex-fiancé Dan Frost 
(Joel Edgerton, “Black Mass”) 
to be her “gunslinger.” The only 
catch is that Hammond thinks 
Dan is dead.

With a tangled plot of love 

triangles, betrayal and dead 

characters who come back to 
life, “Jane Got a Gun” often feels 
like a Nicholas Sparks Western. 
Dan and Jane’s love story is told 
through golden-hued flashbacks 
in which the pair laugh and run 
through various fields.

Jane starts out with peak bad 

bitch potential. She tells her hus-
band to “watch his language” as 
she pulls bullets out of his back, 
then turns around and buys an 
obscene amount of ammo to get 
her revenge. Unfortunately, it’s 
not long until Jane finds herself 
in need of saving. Dan rescues 
her from an alley attacker early 
on, and continues to save her for 
the duration of the film. It’s so 
disappointing because “Jane Got 
a Gun” ends up being more about 
the men around her than Jane 
herself.

“Jane Got a Gun” wants to be 

over just as badly as the audience 
wants it to be. The plot is rushed, 

only taking its time to flesh out 
dramatic flashbacks. Most of the 
film is spent on Jane’s property 
while she and Dan (but mostly 
Dan) fortify the house and wait 
for the impending attack. The 
few scenes of action are rushed 
and therefore insufficient to give 
“Jane Got a Gun” the excite-
ment it so desperately needs. The 
movie sacrifices drama for time 
efficiency and loses in a major 
way.

“Jane” had a rough time mak-

ing it to theaters, and perhaps 
that’s why it feels tired before 
it even begins. After losing the 
original director and a chunk of 
the male cast, Gavin O’Connor 
(“Warrior”) came in, Edgerton 
overhauled the script and the 
movie was “saved.” However, it 
still feels at times like two mov-
ies stitched together. Characters 
— especially villain John Bishop 
(Ewan McGregor, “Mortdecai”) 
— are left painfully underde-
veloped. Perhaps the result of 
too many hands on deck, “Jane 
Got a Gun” seems torn between 
wanting to be a vengeful action 
flick or a movie about the emo-
tional toll of the West. It can’t 
commit fully to either one, and 
fails to find the proper blend of 
the two.

Unfortunately for “Jane Got a 

Gun,” it seems all the action and 
excitement was had off screen.

TV NOTEBOOK
Death Wish Coffee 
super ad to watch

By HAILEY MIDDLEBROOK

Daily Arts Writer

Super Bowl 50 is on CBS this 

Sunday, which means three 
things: beer, Beyonce and bang-
ing commercials. (And Cold-
play, the Carolina Panthers and 
the Denver Broncos, if we’re 
getting technical.) For me, all 
the entertainment of the Super 
Bowl 
happens 
outside 
the 

game — the pregame and pizza; 
the gaudy halftime show; the 
advertisements that make you 
cry (Budweiser clydesdales and 
puppies, I’m looking at you) and 
split your sides (if you haven’t 
seen Anna Kendrick’s New-
castle beer commercial, watch 
it now).

Altogether, the Super Bowl 

is really just a big, fat televised 
spectacle of all things Ameri-
can, from its whooping football 
fans and celebrity shows, to 
its corporate commercials that 
cost upwards of five million 
dollars for 30 seconds of air-
time. To afford a commercial 
slot during the most-watched 
event on TV, companies must 
be very powerful — think Pepsi, 
Doritos, or State Farm Insur-
ance — because the Super Bowl 
doesn’t do small. 

There’s hope, however, for 

small businesses to be heard in 
the Super Bowl. Last August, 
Intuit QuickBooks, an account-
ing software company catered 
towards small businesses, host-
ed a competition called “Small 
Business, Big Game,” in which 
15,000 companies across the 
country entered for the chance 
to win an all-expenses paid, 
30-second 
advertisement 
to 

air during the Super Bowl. For 
inspired 
entrepreneurs 
and 

mom-and-pop shops, winning 
the ad slot would be the oppor-
tunity of a lifetime — their 
products would be broadcast in 

front some 114.4 million people, 
giving the company incredible 
exposure and a springboard for 
future sales.

And for some small business-

es, like New York-based Death 
Wish Coffee, the quirky win-
ner of this year’s competition, 
winning meant another thing: 
getting the country hyped on 
caffeine.

Though Death Wish Coffee 

founder Mike Brown has now 
hired new staff members for his 
roasting crew (for a still-tiny 
staff total of 12) and is expecting 
a huge business growth after the 
Super Bowl, his future hasn’t 
always been certain. Before 
founding Death Wish in 2012, 
Brown worked at a small coffee 
shop, Saratoga Coffee Traders, 
in Saratoga Springs, NY. Brown 
told Fortune magazine that his 
customers would often request 
“a cup of your strongest cof-
fee,” inspiring Brown to tinker 
with his roasting process, using 
robusta coffee beans instead of 
classic arabica beans.

The result? A cup of coffee 

with two times the caffeine of 
an average cup of joe. Brown 
dubbed the jitter-juice “Death 
Wish Coffee,” and the brand 
has steadily gained a cult-like 
fan base (maybe because it’s so 
addictive?), earning more five-
star reviews than any bag of cof-
fee on Amazon. Brown accredits 
to his loyal fans Death Wish’s 
victory 
in 
“Small 
Business, 

Big Game,” as the winner was 
determined by public votes. His 
roastery beat runner-up com-
panies Chubbies Shorts, official 
clothing sponsor of frat boys 
everywhere, as well as Vidler’s 
5 & 10, a family-owned general 
store.

Naturally, the commercial for 

Death Wish is just as intense 
as the brand itself. Released 
late last week, the finished ad 

looks remarkably similar to a 
“Poseidon”-esque movie trailer: 
there’s a soaking wet crew of 
Vikings rolling on a sea of black 
coffee, their fearless captain 
shouting, “The day of reckon-
ing is upon us! Row, awaken and 
welcome death!” Intense battle 
cries follow, like a real-life reen-
actment of a caffeine-induced 
energy surge. The sea turns 
dark, then pours from a mug 
into a coffee drinker’s mouth. 
Death Wish signs off with the 
slogan, “Death Wish Coffee: 
Fiercely Caffeinated.” 

“I think it’s going to be one 

of the best, if not the best ad in 
the Super Bowl,” Brown told Fox 
Business. Whether the commer-
cial stands its ground alongside 
the likes of GoDaddy.com and 
the Esurance baby is yet to be 
determined, but we can safely 
say that Death Wish will be the 
only small business on the field 
this Sunday — and that’s some-
thing to applaud.

Brown continued in his Fox 

Business interview, “Half of 
the entire workforce works for 
small businesses. The fact that 
I’m able to represent small busi-
nesses is an honor.”

Maybe Super Bowl 50 can be 

the game when we all drink a 
little more craft beer and a lit-
tle less Budweiser, the year we 
brew a little more Death Wish 
Coffee and a little less Star-
bucks. After all, what’s more 
American than rooting for, the 
underdog?

Wolverines to compete for Iron D

By KEVIN SANTO 

Daily Sports Writer

For the past 91 years, the 

Michigan hockey team has played 
for plenty of trophies against 
Michigan State.

But 
never 

before 
have 

the Wolverines 
had the chance 
to take home 
hardware quite 
like the one up 
for grabs against 
their 
in-state 

rival 
this 

weekend.

Now, with the 

Duel in the D 
on the horizon, 
Michigan (7-1-2-
1 Big Ten, 16-3-4 
overall) has the 
chance to claim 
possession of the newly crafted 
Iron D trophy.

The trophy — crafted by Erik 

and Israel Nordin — has a “made 
in Detroit feeling” according to 
Michigan coach Red Berenson.

And while Berenson praised 

the Nordin brothers’ work, he 
also emphasized that the in-state 
rivalry already has a life of its own.

“We went down to the factory 

where they made that trophy 
and watched a little bit of the 
production of it — how it’s made, 
where it’s made and why it was 
made,” Berenson said Jan. 25. “I 
think it’s good. It’s the beginning 
of another tradition between the 
two schools. We’ve had that game 
(at Joe Louis Arena) forever, but 
now you’ve got another thing to 
play for.

“It’s 
a 
goal, 
it’s 
a 
mini 

championship, if you would. It’s 
bragging rights. If the players had 
to play for a gum wrapper, they’re 
going to play hard. It’s important to 
them to win.”

The last meeting between the 

two teams came Jan. 8 and Jan. 
9, when the Wolverines handed 

Michigan 
State 
back-to-back 

losses, 9-2 and 6-3.

Though the Spartans (2-8-0-

0, 6-18-2) got on the board first 
in both matchups, they had no 
answer for the Michigan offense 
that is averaging a nation best five 
goals per game.

The 15-goal weekend was led, as 

usual, by the Wolverines’ first line. 
Freshman forward Kyle Connor 
and junior forwards Tyler Motte 
and JT Compher combined for 
seven goals in two games.

Michigan State now faces the 

task of stopping the trio that seems 
to be growing more dominant 
every time they take the ice 
together.

And that will be a tall task for 

the Spartans’ blueliners, who are 
tied for last in the Big Ten in team 
defense, allowing 4.30 goals per 
game. Part of that problem falls 
on the shoulders of goaltender 
Jake Hildebrand, whose .930 save 

percentage from last year has 
plummeted to .896.

Regardless of the approach 

Michigan State takes to stop the 
top line, the Wolverines won’t 
look to fix what isn’t broken, as 
Compher, Motte and Connor have 
combined for 75 points in 10 games.

“We’re just trying to focus on 

ourselves,” Compher said. “For my 
line, just keep playing hard, second 
efforts, two-way hockey. (We 
will be) sticking to what’s been 
working, which is moving the puck 
and get in the dirty areas.”

Michigan’s defensive unit, on 

the other hand, is coming off a 
weekend in which it allowed seven 
goals to then-No. 15 Penn State.

While 
that 
mark 
is 

unimpressive, senior goaltender 
Steve Racine recorded a .918 
save percentage on the weekend 
against the Nittany Lions, giving 
the 
Wolverines 
some 
reason 

for optimism. And coming off 

the sweep against Penn State, 
Michigan will have solid footing 
entering the matchup with the 
Spartans — standing at No. 4 in the 
PairWise Rankings.

But that ranking comes with a 

bullseye, as the Wolverines have a 
lot more than a trophy to lose this 
weekend.

A loss to the Spartans, who 

are fifth in the Big Ten, could be 
catastrophic to Michigan’s position 
in the PairWise Rankings, which 
are used to determine the NCAA 
Tournament field and seeding.

Based on the last meeting 

between the two sides, these aren’t 
games the Wolverines should lose, 
but nothing is guaranteed.

“Obviously they compete really 

hard,” Connor said. “I think it’s 
just something with the rivalry. 
When you throw out the rankings, 
you throw out the record, it doesn’t 
really matter at this point. It’s 
going to be a hard game to play in.”

‘M’ hosts Illinois

By TED JANES

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team (4-7 Big Ten, 12-10 
overall) needs to rebound — both 
metaphorically and literally.

After 
the 

Wolverines 
were 
handed 

their worst loss 
of the season 
Wednesday — a 
21-point defeat 
against No. 17 
Michigan State 
— they have 
potentially 
their 
easiest 

chance 
to 

bounce back.

Sunday, 

Michigan hosts 
Illinois (1-10 Big Ten, 8-14 overall), 
the lowest-ranked team in the Big 
Ten.

It’s likely that neither team will 

make the NCAA Tournament, 
but the game has postseason 
implications nonetheless.

The 
Big 
Ten 
Tournament 

begins in less than a month, 
and the four worst teams in the 
conference face each other to 
start the tournament. Depending 
on the outcomes of other games, 
a loss for Michigan this weekend 
could drop the team one spot 
down into the bottom four.

Michigan wants the highest 

seed it can get when it arrives in 
Indianapolis on Mar. 2. With just 
seven games left, including road 
games against No. 5 Maryland and 
Purdue — a team that scraped past 
Michigan by two points Dec. 30 — 
it will be tough for the Wolverines 
to get any higher than the No. 5 or 
No. 6 spot.

But if Michigan coach Kim 

Barnes Arico has a plan up 
her sleeve, it will start with 
rebounding this weekend against 
Illinois.

Against a strong Michigan State 

frontcourt, 
Michigan 
suffered 

on the glass and lost the rebound 
battle, 38-23.

In conference play, Michigan is 

0-5 when it loses the rebounding 
battle. For the most part, the 
Wolverines have been neck and 
neck on the glass — averaging 
35.5 rebounds, just half a rebound 
fewer than their opponents.

Michigan can’t afford to get 

blown out on the glass, but Illinois 
doesn’t have the same quality that 
Michigan State possessed.

The Fighting Illini are on a five-

game skid, bear the worst record 
in the Big Ten and are averaging 
double-digit 
losses 
against 

conference opponents.

Illinois’s worst loss of the season 

came Jan. 7, losing by 31 points to 
the Golden Gophers, a team the 
Wolverines beat twice this season.

The Illini’s match for Michigan 

freshman center Hallie Thome 
will be center Chatrice White. At 
6-foot-3, White doesn’t have the 
height advantage over Michigan’s 
star freshman, who measures at 
6-foot-5. Thome averages 14 points 
and 5.8 rebounds.

Michigan’s advantage, though, 

comes from its guards. Standout 
sophomore Katelynn Flaherty, 
who averages 22.3 points per 
game, continues to impress despite 
a struggling supporting cast.

Besides Flaherty, who scored 

18 points against the Spartans, 
freshman guard Boogie Brozoski 
put up 13 points off the bench, 
but not much else went right on 
offense in East Lansing.

“We got tight, and we just 

tried to get the ball to (Flaherty),” 
Barnes Arico said. “Instead of 
multiple people trying to do things 
for our team, their pressure really 
got to us.”

Flaherty won’t have as tough 

an opponent against Illinois, and 
it’s not unreasonable to think she 
could go for at least 20 points, but 
how the rest of the team steps up 
could be the deciding factor.

Walker’s bravado impresses

By ZACH SHAW 

Daily Sports Editor

As one of the nation’s top high 

school running backs, no one 
would be surprised at Kareem 
Walker’s high self-confidence. 
The Michigan early enrollee 
has boasted about his ability to 
recruit other prospects and didn’t 
shy away from saying he has no 
intentions of riding the bench for 
the Wolverines on Wednesday.

But Michigan running backs 

coach Tyrone Wheatley was still 
taken aback on a visit with Walker, 
when the discussion turned to 
Walker wearing Wheatley’s old 
number in the fall.

“He looked at me, and he said, 

‘So, that was your number, No. 6 
right?’ And I said, ‘Yeah, 6 was 
my number,’ ” Wheatley said to 
the Daily on Wednesday. “Then 
he looked right at me and he said, 
‘You were pretty good, huh?’ and 
I said, ‘Yeah, I was alright.’

“Then he said, ‘But I’m gonna 

show you how to rock No. 6, and 
I’m gonna show you how to rock it 
with swag. And, um, I’ll probably 
be the leading rusher when I 
leave here.’ ”

Though 
surprised 
at 
the 

audacity, Wheatley knew well 
before that moment that Walker’s 
confidence is more ambition than 
arrogance.

The 
6-foot-1, 
210-pound 

Walker finished his high school 
career with 4,563 rushing yards 
and 55 touchdowns, and enrolled 
less than a week after committing 
to the Wolverines in December.

“The thing about him is that he 

wants to work to back his words 
up,” Wheatley said. “That’s what 
I like about him, and that’s what 
you want as a coach. It’s not 
words with him, it’s work. He’s 
not afraid of it.”

If Walker wants to make 

good on his pledge to play as a 
freshman, he will need to surpass 
several 
experienced 
backs. 

Michigan returns its top three 
rushers from last season (junior 

De’Veon Smith, redshirt junior 
Drake Johnson and redshirt 
sophomore Ty Isaac) and bears 
plenty of underclassmen who 
Wheatley said should compete for 
carries.

But Wheatley also noted that 

the running back race is one 
of equal opportunity, and that 
Walker has a chance to run away 
with the job.

“He’s in it to win it,” Wheatley 

said. “He’s one of those guys that 
wants to be the best, and he’s also 
hungry to learn. He’s a sponge 
right now. He wants to be around 
the best, and that’s one of the top 
things I like about him.

“If Kareem sticks, then hell, 

we’re gonna go with Kareem.”

And though some might want 

unproven 
freshman 
running 

backs to hold back on the 
confidence, Wheatley said as long 
as the work is behind it, he doesn’t 
mind.

“It’s just one of those things 

that draws you closer to him,” 
Wheatley said. “It’s a confidence, 
not arrogance, just a confidence. 
… The first time I met him, I knew 
I liked this guy.”

Even 
if 
Walker 
takes 

Wheatley’s old number.

Johnson back on track: One of 

Walker’s competitors, Johnson, 
has temporarily taken his talents 
elsewhere, 
joining 
Michigan’s 

track team as a hurdler.

Though 
it 
detracts 
from 

Johnson’s 
football 
focus, 

Wheatley 
— 
a 
former 
All-

American 
track 
athlete 
at 

Michigan — had no hesitation 
signing off on the decision, and 
thinks it might even benefit 
Johnson.

“What it did for me was 

it refreshed me. It gave me 
a reset,” Wheatley said. “It 
gave me a chance to get away 
from 
Schembechler 
(Hall). 

Different 
group 
of 
people, 

different environment, different 

competition level. Then all of a 
sudden, what it’s time to get back 
into Schem, I can’t wait to get 
back.”

Wheatley 
also 
noted 
that 

Johnson, 
who 
was 
an 
All-

American hurdler in high school, 
could use the time to rebuild 
confidence in his speed. Johnson 
has already suffered two anterior 
cruciate ligament tears and said 
after Michigan’s Citrus Bowl win 
that his recovery took longer than 
he had hoped.

“I think he understands that 

football is a priority, and I think 
that’s part of why he’s running 
track,” 
Wheatley 
said. 
“To 

help liven his legs back up, get 
the speed back, get the agility 
back. Even though you’re racing 
against an opponent, you’re really 
racing against the time, against 
self-improvement.

“All those things that he’s 

doing (are) really to make him 
better at football.”

Freshman running back Kareem Walker figures to compete for playing time in his first season at Michigan.

Partridge wins top recruiter award

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Editor

It didn’t take long for Chris 

Partridge to prove he was ready 
to help out a college football 
program, and now he has an 
award to show for it.

Less than two years removed 

from coaching Paramus Catholic 
High School in New Jersey 
and less than one month after 
being promoted to linebacker 
and co-special teams coach for 
Michigan, Partridge took home 
Scout.com’s National Recruiter 
of the Year award.

Partridge earned the award 

after playing a key role in 
landing 
the 
nation’s 
No. 
1 

overall 
recruit 
in 
Rashan 

Gary, helping implement the 
innovative-yet-controversial 
“satellite camps,” and hosting 
dozens of recruits on campus as 
a recruiting coordinator during 
the Wolverines’ regular season.

But to Partridge, it wasn’t 

until he became a position coach 
in 
December, 
allowing 
him 

to recruit off campus, that he 
truly got to make an impact at 
Michigan.

“If 
you 
think 
about 
it,” 

Partridge said, “I spent the 
entire year talking to these kids 
and their families, and then 
finally in December, I was able 
to get out there and get in their 
home and really meet them.

“It was awesome. I got to 

know who they really are. I was 
really excited about it, and I 
was trying to get to see as many 
as I could in December and 
January.”

After two months of joining 

his fellow coaches on the road, 
Partridge’s efforts as recruiting 
coordinator 
and 
assistant 

coach came to fruition. The 
Wolverines landed Gary, five 
other highly touted recruits 
from Partridge’s home state of 
New Jersey and ended National 
Signing Day with the nation’s 
No. 6 overall recruiting class.

When reflecting on the effort, 

Partridge, 34, cited innovation 
and quick learning as traits 
that allowed him to adapt to the 
college level.

“You’ve got to be open-minded 

when you come into a job like 
this,” Partridge said. “You’ve 
really got to be a sponge.

“I feel like in the game of 

football you can never learn 
enough. You can never stop 
moving.”

One of the most significant 

ways Partridge kept moving, 
even 
when 
NCAA 
rules 

mandated he could not travel 
to visit recruits, was through 
Michigan’s “Summer Swarm” 
tour. The series of football 
clinics were based in recruiting 
hotbeds 
such 
as 
Alabama, 

California, Florida, Texas and 
Pennsylvania.

A large portion of Michigan’s 

recent 
signees 
attended 

the 
camps, 
validating 
their 

effectiveness. They were so 
effective, in fact, that both the 
Southeastern Conference and 
Atlantic Coast Conference have 
begun an effort to make them 
illegal.

When 
asked 
about 
the 

ethicality 
of 
the 
camps 

Wednesday, Partridge doubled 
down.

“It has nothing to do with 

poaching recruits,” Partridge 
said. “We’re going out, and 
we’re coaching football. If you 

came to those camps, you would 
see our coaches got off the bus, 
got out of their cars and just 
starting working and coaching. 
We 
weren’t 
evaluating, 
we 

weren’t standing there with a 
pen and paper or stopwatch, we 
were just coaching football.

“Maybe 
the 
people 

complaining about it don’t want 
to get off their butt and go do 
it. We’re willing to do it, and I 
think they should continue to let 
us do it more and more.”

With a slight post-signing 

day lull in the recruiting cycle, 
Partridge now turns his focus to 
learning his latest jobs. Though 
he was a successful head coach at 
the high school level, Partridge 
has rather large shoes to fill 
in 2016. He will replace D.J. 
Durkin — who became the head 
coach at Maryland in December 
— as linebackers coach and 
succeed John Baxter at special 
teams. The Wolverines finished 
12th last season in special teams 
efficiency under Baxter, who 
left for Southern California.

Special teams assistant and 

tight ends coach Jay Harbaugh 
and Partridge plan to travel 
the country and visit practices 
and clinics to create a scheme 

for special teams. Partridge 
listed the Baltimore Ravens and 
“whoever’s good” as current 
targets.

“It’s like anything,” Partridge 

said. “You can always learn. You 
can always get better and learn. 
Baxter’s a great coach, and, of 
course, we’ve got heavy shoes 
to fill, but we’re just going to do 
as much research as we can and 
figure out exactly what schemes 
we want, work our kids hard and 
work tirelessly at getting them 
to fit into the scheme and do 
the right thing on the field and 
hopefully be pretty good.”

Partridge 
applies 
that 

principle to Michigan as well. 
Recognizing that he has less 
experiences than most coaches 
in Schembechler Hall, Partridge 
quickly 
began 
taking 
notes 

every step of the way.

“It’s like a coaches’ clinic 

every day,” Partridge said. “You 
can carry a notebook around 
and just write down what the 
different coaches say. You can 
sit in their office and always 
learn stuff from them.”

If he keeps up the award-

winning pace, Partridge’s office 
might become a clinic of its own 
soon.

MSU’s Costello 
talks ‘M’ rivalry

By KELLY HALL

Daily Sports Editor

The No. 10 Michigan State 

basketball team (6-4 Big Ten, 
19-4 overall) is headed to Ann 
Arbor 
on 

Saturday 
hoping 
to 
extend 

its 
three-

game 
winning 
streak. 
The Wolverines (7-3, 17-6), on the 
other hand, seek redemption after 
letting No. 22 Indiana stomp all 
over them Tuesday. 

In Michigan’s worst stretch of 

the season, the Hoosiers scored 
25 straight points in nine minutes 
to give Indiana a 45-24 lead at 
halftime, then they scored the 
first three points of the second 
half, too. 

On top of the pressure that 

comes with regrouping after a 
poor 
performance, 
Michigan 

might have to play its 10th 
straight game without senior 
Caris LeVert. The guard’s status 
is still uncertain after being 
sidelined with a lower leg injury 
Jan. 2.

The Daily sat down with 

Michigan State forward Matt 
Costello at Big Ten Media Day 
in October to chat about the 
in-state rivalry, Crisler Center’s 
environment and the picture 
of Michigan football coach Jim 
Harbaugh wearing an Izzone 
T-shirt.

The Michigan Daily: How 

does growing up in Michigan play 
into your emotions for the rivalry? 
And now that you’re a senior, 
what it going to be like playing 
(Michigan) for a last time?

Matt Costello: What’s a team 

without a rival? It’s been a fun 
ride. I love playing Michigan 
every time just because everyone 
gets so hype for it — fans, players, 
coaches, everybody. I’ve really 
enjoyed the rivalry. It kinda stinks 
we only get to play Michigan once 
this year. I wish we could play 

(Michigan) twice.

TMD: What do you think of 

the Crisler Center environment?

MC: I think it’s really good. 

The thing I don’t like about it 
is how spread out everything is 
because it’s like, at the Breslin 
Center, everyone’s on top of 
you, and Crisler is a little more 
spread out. It’s a little more of a 
dimmed-out environment, but 
when the fans are rocking, it’s 
just like any other stadium. It 
gets crazy.

TMD: You’ve been playing 

against some of these guys 
for a few years now, like Spike 
(Albrecht) and Caris (LeVert). 
What is it like, getting to play 
these guys years after year?

MC: It’s a cool experience 

because you don’t get to talk to 
them that much when you’re 
playing, but just seeing faces over 
and over again, seeing film. Like, 
I probably know their games 
better than most other people 
because we’ve watched so much 
of it. It’s kind of a bond you’ll 
have forever. Not that you were 
that personal with them, but 
you’ll follow them wherever you 
go because you played them so 
much.

TMD: The Magic Johnson 

statue was vandalized not too 
long ago (in October). What do 
you think about that?

MC: I think it reflects the 

opinions of some of the fans, 
but that’s not all of the fans at 
Michigan. We know that not 
everyone is disrespectful like 
that. It is what it is. It’s a college 
campus. It’s going to happen. 
I know we did some last year. 
What it all really comes down to 
is we have a (football) game on 
Saturday, and that’s what we’re 
playing for. Fans are going to do 
what they’re going to do. It’s game 
time Saturday.

TMD: Have you seen the 

picture of Harbaugh wearing the 
Izzone T-shirt?

MC: Yeah, it’s funny. It’s crazy 

what people can dig up. It was 
really funny seeing that.

Recruiting class 
raises standards

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

Just before noon Wednesday, 

Brandon Peters heard his name 
called. He stood and walked 
onto the stage at Hill Auditorium 
during the Michigan football 
team’s “Signing of the Stars” 
ceremony.

At that point, Peters — a four-

star quarterback recruit from 
Avon, Ind. — took the microphone 
from 
New 
England 
Patriots 

quarterback Tom Brady and sat 
down next to Harbaugh on the 
stage.

If that was setting the bar too 

high for the 18-year-old Peters, he 
didn’t show it.

“It’s not easy, but I’m kind of a 

humble person, so I don’t really 
look to do that stuff that much,” 
Peters said. “I just do me.”

In his first season, Harbaugh 

exceeded 
all 
realistic 

expectations with a 10-3 season. 
Now, he has plenty more talent 
on the way — and for them, the 
expectations will be much higher 
from the get-go.

In all, the class currently 

comprises 28 players. Dytarious 
Johnson, a three-star linebacker 
from Prattville, Ala., could be 
the 29th if he signs. While the 
Wolverines’ class is bigger than 
average, the seven early enrollees’ 
scholarships can be back-dated to 
the class of 2015 to balance it out.

Michigan’s 
class 
of 
2015 

featured 
just 
14 
players, 

decimated by the program’s 
struggles during the 2014 season 
and the firing of former coach 
Brady Hoke.

But the Wolverines bounced 

back in a big way this season, 
garnering 
the 
nation’s 
fifth-

ranked class.

“From top to bottom, this 

recruiting class is youngsters that 
have a real heart for competing, a 
heart for football,” Harbaugh said. 

“They’ve got football faces. They’re 
competitive in the classroom. 
They have worked so hard to put 
themselves in a position to be here. 
I love them all.”

No discussion of Michigan’s 

recruiting 
class 
is 
complete 

without perhaps the jewel of the 
class, five-star defensive tackle 
Rashan Gary. Gary, the No. 1 
overall recruit in the nation, 
committed Wednesday toward 
the end of the “Signing of the 
Stars” ceremony.

Of the early enrollees, Peters 

has received the most publicity. He 
came to the stage first Wednesday, 
and Harbaugh compared him 
to his former quarterback at 
Stanford, Andrew Luck.

“I saw a lot of similar things in 

Brandon — a natural player, not 
over-coached, 
over-mechanic-

ed, naturally out there playing,” 
Harbaugh said. 

At 
the 
event, 
four-star 

linebacker Devin Bush shared 
a Harbaugh recruiting story. 
During his in-home visit, the 
two 
started 
playing 
spades, 

and Harbaugh lost a couple of 
games — so Bush and the ultra-
competitive Harbaugh ended up 
playing for four hours, according 
to Bush.

Another signing day highlight 

was adding top-ranked kicker 
Quinn Nordin out of Rockford, 
Mich. Nordin’s name has been 
in the headlines in recent weeks 
for a different reason: When the 
recruiting dead period ended 
last month, Harbaugh slept over 
at Nordin’s house during an 
in-home visit.

Finally able to comment on the 

sleepover, Harbaugh joked that 
the bed he stayed in at Nordin’s 
house was one of the most 
comfortable he’d ever slept in.

“Just having fun,” Harbaugh 

said. “If people criticize that, then 
so be it, but we’re enjoying the 
heck out of it.”
