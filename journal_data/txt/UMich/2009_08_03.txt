Candidates debate
issues before Aug. 4
primary election
By JASMINE ZHU and
LARA ZADE
Daily News Editors
Ann Arbor residents from
Ward 3 and Ward 5 will head to
the polls on Tuesday to vote for
their preferred candidates in the
Democratic primary City Council
election.
This year's group of five candi-
dates includes two incumbents, a
previous city council member, a
former primary candidate and a
first-year primary runner.

Ward 3
Ward 3 residents will choose
among three candidates - incum-
bent Leigh Greden (D-Ward 3),
LuAnne Bullington and Stephen
Kunselman.
All three said they hoped for
greater student turnout in the pri-
mary.
Bullington said she believes stu-
dent votes are key but that she was
concerned that the way the wards
are separated will split the student
vote.
Kunselman, a former City Coun-
cil member from 2006 to 2008 and
current University energy man-
agement liaison, has been heavily
campaigning in student neighbor-
hoods.

"I'm hoping that the student
vote on August 4 comes my way,"
Kunselman said. "I think I'm the
only candidate of the three that
recognizes the importance of our
youth."
Greden said he was disappoint-
ed in the low amount of student
voters in the past and was the least
optimistic among all three can-
didates that the student turnout
would increase this year.
"I wish students would vote
more," Greden said. "The reality
is that in the third ward in August,
we will see less than a dozen stu-
dents cast a vote ... and that's unfor-
tunate."
If elected, the candidates said
they would undertake issues per-
tinent to students including leasing

policies, the proposed city income
tax and student safety.
Bullington said the dim lighting
on South University Avenue has to
be tackled because of safety con-
cerns.
"Mainly we need to make sure
that the students are safe when
they're out and about downtown at
night," she said.
Kunselman said he was against
the proposed city income tax,
which would affect students work-
ing in Ann Arbor. The tax would
cost Ann Arbor residents 1 percent
of their annual income and non-
residents 0.5 percent of their annu-
al income.
Though Greden is a proponent of
a city income tax, he said he has a

2 graffiti draws attention

Anti-graffiti
ordinance causes
mixed reactions
By STEPHANIE STEINBERG
Daily News Editor
It's on stop signs, mailboxes and
ATMs. It's on walls, stairwells and
lampposts. Odds are you've seen it
on your way to class or walked by it
and didn't even notice.
It's the word "duck" written in
neat cursive. While some call it
graffiti and others call it art, its
presence - plastered on hundreds
of obscure locations on campus and
throughout Ann Arbor - is difficult
to ignore.
Some students have picked up on
the trend and have posted inquiries
about the artist on blogs. Others,
like University alum Preston Hart,
have taken pictures documenting
the duck tagspots.
Hart first noticed the tags on his
way to class about a year ago.
"From then on, wherever I went
I've been kind of on the lookout for
others," Hart said.
Hart began taking pictures and
posting them on his Flickr account,
which has 89 images of the graffiti
in different places around campus.
Hart estimates he has seen at least
50 more.
"I think that the average person
doesn't really notice it, and that's
one of the things that interests me

about it because (the tags) are so
ubiquitous, especially on Central
Campus," Hart said. "The aver-
age person with classes on Central
Campus probably passes dozens of
them unknowingly."
Diane Brown, Department of
Public Safety spokeswoman, said
University police have had to deal
with other graffiti sightings this
summer, but said she was not aware
of the "duck" tag.
Whether it's an individual or a
group of people drawing the signa-
ture, if caught, Brown said the sub-
ject would be charged based on the
cost of the damages.
"If they use permanent paint
then it comes down to what is the
dollar amount incurred to clean
that up and restore that - whether
it's a building or wall or sign or win-
dow or whatever it is - (we look at)
what dollar amount it would take to
restore it to its original situation,"
Brown said.
Brown said the subject would
also be charged with a misdemean-
or for destruction of property, but
the charge varies based on the dol-
lar value of the property destroyed.
But, if graffiti artists use chalk,
they cannot be fined because chalk
is not permanent.
"If someone drew chalk on the
sidewalk then technically there's
no damage, and that's considered
freedom of speech, and the rain will
wash it away," Brown said.

of the Main Street Area Associa-
tion, said he has no knowledge as
to who is producing the duck graf-
fiti, but said it's more important to
remove the work rather than find
its creator.
"What has been found is that the
best deterrent to graffiti isn't doing
all the detective work finding out
exactly who it is," Clark said. "It's
just taking care of the graffiti as
soon as possible so that other graf-
fiti artists don't see graffiti, because
once you see graffiti you know that
you can get away with it, and it kind
of self propagates itself."
In an attempt to eliminate the

graffitiscrawled around AnnArbor,
the Ann Arbor City Council voted
in January to enact an anti-graffiti
ordinance. The ordinance requires
property owners to remove graffiti
from their building within seven
days after notification from the city.
If they don't, the city will remove
the work, and owners will have to
pay the city for the expense.
While the ordinance took effect
in May, Clark said he hasn't wit-
nessed any drastic changes to the
amount of graffiti in downtown
Ann Arbor, adding that residents
have to complain in order for the

ordinance tobe effective.
"The ordinance, for better or
worse, is complaint-based, so there
is no one running around basically
issuing tickets to anybody unless
someone complains," he said.
Clark said he hopes to organize
a "graffiti walk" with the Main
Street Association in the near
future. The event would occur on
the weekend, and members would
walk around Ann Arbor, locating
graffiti and talking with building
owners to inform them of the ordi-
nance.
"(We'd) tell them, 'Hey, you
know there's an ordinance. You're
in violation. Here's some informa-
tion about the grants that theDo-
wntown Development Authority
has made available to help pay for
the clean up,"' Clark said.
Because building owners and
tenants have to pay to remove the
graffiti, the Ann Arbor DDA has
made grants available for property
owners who may not be able to
afford to remove graffiti.
"Sooner or later someone is
going to call the building owner
and say, 'You've got to clean this
up,"' Clark said. "So we're just
focusing on educating people that

this doesn't necessarily mean
you're on the hook on paying for
everything, (because) there are
resources available."
City Council member Christo-
pher Taylor (D-Ward 3), one of the
sponsors of the graffiti proposal,
said City Council has not yet evalu-
ated the effectiveness of the ordi-
nance.
"I don't know the extent to
which folks have been calling com-
munity standards and the actions
that have been taken after that - if
in fact people have been calling,"
he said.
Taylor said City Council will
review the ordinance in a report
six months to one year from now.
Dave DeVarti, an Ann Arbor
resident and co-owner of three
condominiums on 212 East Huron,
received a notice taped to the door
ofthebuildingtellinghimtoremove
the graffiti on the outside wall.
DeVarti, who likes graffiti, was
angry at City Council for forcing
him and other building owners to
cover it up.
"We're in favor of graffiti, and
we don't mind it on our building,"
he said.
For now, DeVarti complied and
painted over it, but he said he plans
on fighting the ordinance by post-
ing a sign outside that invites all
graffiti artists to paint on the wall.

"We encourage the community
to express themselves with graffiti
on our building as long as it's not
on the windows," DeVarti said.
He added that he considers
graffiti a "Constitutional right of
freedom of expression."
"If we want to put a mural on it
we should be able to put a mural
on it," DeVarti said. "If we want
to hire a graffiti artist to put some
graffiti art on the back we should
be able to do that."
DeVarti also said the city has
bigger issues like homelessness
and hunger, and energy should be
focused on fixing those problems
instead of eradicating graffiti.
"I think the council is wasting its
time onthings like this," he said.
While the graffiti in Ann Arbor
remains a debated topic, no one
seems to know who is behind the
duck tags.
Hart said he suspects it may be
an LSA student because the graf-
fiti is prominent on Central Cam-
pus, citingthe fact that he has seen
some in Angell Hall and none on
North Campus.
Whoever is behind all of the
"duck" tags, Hart doesn't mind
seeing the word scattered every-
where.
"I've always enjoyed finding
them just because I've turned it
into a little game," he said.

City Council primary gives students an opportunity get involved
Though the Ann Arbor City Council election isn't until Nov. 3,
the election that really matters is only a day away. Thanks to the
city's liberal streak, few Republican candidates enter the race,
meaning that tomorrow's Democratic primary is the real decider. But
despite the importance of voting in the primary, few students head to
the polls. While it's true that students face significant voting impedi-
ments, nothing will change until students demonstrate more interest in
city government.

demonstrated with the example a graduate student.

This time around, there are two
contested seats in the primary:
Ward 3 and Ward 5. Vying for the
Ward 3 seat are three candidates
so well qualified that determin-
ing the best option is difficult.
Challenger LuAnne Bulling-
ton is an advocate for student
voices in city government - she
opposes the current ward struc-
ture, which spreads the student
population over several wards to
prevent them from influencing
City Council. But her opposition
to important green initiatives
like LED streetlights on the basis
of cost is troubling, as is her ada-
mant support for pesky building
height caps. Some city residents
fear that high rises would dimin-
ishthecity'scharacterandcharm,
but they would actually offer stu-
dents more affordable housing
and combat urban sprawl.
Another contender, Stephen
Kunselman, was a Ward 3 City
Council member for two years
before losing his seat in last year's
election. Kunselman has earned
the Daily's endorsement in years
past because of his bold and intel-
ligent positions on important
issues, including his (somewhat
infamous) support of the ordi-
nance that allowed residents to
keep chickens on their property.

He also favorsgreen space outside
the city rather than downtown,
which would allow for space
for housing. He demonstrates
the kind of practical thinking
that City Council needs. On the
downside, he seems more eager
to defeat incumbent City Council
member Leigh Greden than to get
to work serving residents.
Greden has also enjoyed the
support of the Daily in previ-
ous elections. He has an impres-
sive record of getting things
done since being elected as a
Ward 3 representative in 2003.
One recent example is his push
for necessary improvements
to the way businesses in the
city recycle their trash. But he
also supports height caps that
hinder new development. And
while he's been involved in city
collaboration efforts with the
Michigan Student Assembly,
he doesn't seem enthusiastic
to encourage students to get
involved in city government.
While Greden has served the
city well, Kunselman is the kind
of independent thinker that
City Council needs. In Ward 3,
The Daily endorses STEPHEN
KUNSELMAN.
In Ward 5, incumbent Mike
Anglin is challenged by Scott

Rosencrans. Anglin has a long
history of community involve-
ment stretching fromWashington
D.C. to New York to Ann Arbor.
On one hand, he voices sympa-
thy for students' inability to par-
ticipate in the city. But his push
for extensive green space in the
city doesn't seem realistic given
students' ever-growing need for
more centrally located housing.
His time on City Council has pro-
duced similarly mixed results,
with principled stances on issues
like mass transit but also plenty of
votes for the status quo.
Rosencrans certainly cares
about the city, having served
on nine committees in the past
four years. And his support for
a densely populated downtown
featuring affordable housing
is encouraging. But he doesn't
seem as knowledgeable about the
needs of the city as Anglin. It also
seems likely that he would have
difficulty implementing his ideas
given his relative inexperience.
Though Anglin's vision for
the city might not be complete-
ly viable, voters should trust in
his experience working with
in communities and his attrac-
tive and progressive idealism.
In Ward 5, The Daily endorses
MIKE ANGLIN.

Smoking or non?

After strolling into my new
workplace three weeks
ago and meeting my co-
workers for
the first time, I
quickly learned
that one was a
smoker. Luck-
ily, my work- '
place was very
accommodat-
ing to non- PATRICK
smokers like ZABAWA
me. The build-_
ing we were in
looked like it had been specifi-
cally designed to keep smokers
and non-smokers separate, with
permanent overhangs outside the
building where smokers lurked
all day - overhangs far from the
main entrances that the rest of us
frequented.
But other workplaces in Michi-
gan aren't so accommodating to
non-smokers. This is especially
true for bars and restaurants.
Employees there have no choice
but to inhale the dangerous sec-
ondhand smoke permeating the
establishment's air day after day.
To protect the health of these
employees, the Michigan legisla-
ture has repeatedly tried over the
past three years to pass a state-
wide ban on smoking in all indoor
public places. But its efforts have
always failed - and rightly so.
A statewide ban would infringe
upon the rights of bar and res-
taurant owners and would be an
unnecessary extension of govern-
ment into the lives of private citi-
zens. But in the past two months,
a number of restaurants in Ann
Arbor have decided to stop smok-
ers at the door on their own. Their
decision shows that bar and res-
taurant owners can make healthy
decisions about smoking in their
establishments - and that the
state legislature should stop try-
ing to take away their ability to

do what they want with their own
establishments.
Banning smoking in bars and
restaurants statewide would be a
draconian move, taking away the
liberty of smokers - like my co-
worker - even at the establish-
ments that choose to welcome
them. It would be an example of
the state using the law to pre-
vent bar and restaurant owners
from making their own decisions
regarding their own property.
But many people believe that
the state should take this liberty
away from those owners.
It all comes down to choice.
People choose to smoke, bar and
restaurant owners choose to let
them smoke on their premises
and their restaurant employees
choose to work there. All are free
to do the opposite - smokers can
quit, bar and restaurant owners
can prevent smoking on their
premises and their employees
can seek jobs elsewhere.
But supporters of a statewide
smoking ban point out that bar
and restaurant employees often
have no option but to face smok-
ing in the workplace. If employees
want to escape their smoky work
environment, finding a new job
in Michigan is nearly impossible.
And bar and restaurants owners
have typically been afraid to ban
smoking in their establishments
because they're afraid they'll
lose customers to the place next
door - the one that still welcomes
smokers. Many bar and restaurant
owners actually support a state-
wide smoking ban - that way they
wouldn't lose customers.
But a July 22 Ann Arbor News
article listed three Ann Arbor
restaurants that have decided
this summer to ban smoking in
their establishments - The Pull
Moon, The Earle and Arbor Brew-
ing Company (Tired of waiting
for legislature to act, Ann Arbor

restaurants ban smoking in their
establishments, 07/22/2009). The
Earle did it as a result of Ann
Arbor's Restaurant Week. Arbor
Brewing Company did it for the
health of its employees.
These three Ann Arbor restau-
rants have shown that - contrary
to popular belief - many restau-
rant owners' desire to prevent
smoking ontheir premises and are
willingto do it without a statewide
ban. In fact, according to the Ann
Arbor News article, Arbor Brew-
ing Company also banned smok-
ing there because of the state's
inaction with a smoking ban.
The restaurant was tired of wait-
ing for the state to ensure that its
competitors didn't get its smoking
patrons, so it risked its business
in order to make the restaurant a
healthy environment.
A statewide
smoking ban is
unnecessary.
A smoking ban in Michigan
would infringe upon owners'
rights to do what they please with
their property. And the simple
discussion of a statewide smok-
ing ban is distracting bar and
restaurant owners from stopping
smoking in their establishments
- keeping their employees in the
very environment supporters of a
statewide ban want to take them
out of. The state should stop this
fruitless discussion and let restau-
rant owners make their own deci-
sions - decisions that are turning
out to be in everyone's interest.

"long record working closely with
students."
Greden is the current chair of the
council's Student Relations Com-
mittee. He also sponsored a 2006
leasing ordinance that gave pro-
spective renters more time to sign
leases.
"I sponsored the lease ordinance,
which was brought to my intention
by the students," Greden said. "It
was to help all renters citywide, but
particularly students, to avoid the
pressure of landlords tryingto pres-
sure them to sign leases in the early
stages."
All three candidates also agreed
that there should be more commu-
nication between the city and the
University.
"The city needs to better recog-
nize the University isa key player in
the community - a huge job creator
- but the University needs to rec-
ognize that it cannot succeed as an
employer if the city is struggling,"
Greden said.
"What'sbad for the city is bad for
the University," Greden added.
Bullington said shebelieves there

said. "Even if you come down on the
opposite side of an issue today, you
have a good relationship that you
can work from tomorrow."
He added that his experience
working on numerous city commit-
tees - such as the Ann Arbor Park
Advisory Commission and the Ann
Arbor Environmental Commission
- has enabled him to studybudgets,
infrastructure, natural area preser-
vation, recycling and a full range of
other topics that he could face as a
City Council member.
Concerns raised by the candi-
dates include city budget efficiency,
mass transit, efforts to keep the
city environmental-friendly and
increasing the student vote.
Both Anglin and Rosencrans
agreed that maintaining anefficient
city budget in the coming years
takes priority over other concerns.
Anglin said residents should have
more of a say in the city's budget
process and spending priorities.
Rosencrans said the city could
cut costs through the concept of
"regionalism" - sharing resources
and facilities with townships, the
county, public schools and the Uni-
versity to foster greater economic
efficiency and cooperation among
those bodies.

promoting the city's green initia-
tives. He said he wants to bring
recycling in the business communi-
ties up to par with the programs in
the residential communities, which
are recycling up to 50 percent. He
added that he wants better protec-
tion for the Huron River - an ini-
tiative Anglin also highly endorsed.
Mass transit within Ann Arbor
is another one of Anglin's top pri-
orities. Anglin said he's looking to
improve transportation for students
and other residents and that this
issue is one that City Council and
the University could collaborate on.
He said a coalitionbetween the two
bodies could result in more trans-
portation options and funding.
Both candidates stressed that
they would like to see greater stu-
dent turnout in the primary and
general elections. Anglin said more
student input could help City Coun-
cil members define downtown
development in terms of parking,
safety, noise ordinances and build-
ing appearance.
Rosencrans said he thinks the
student vote is important and that
students are a part of the voting
population that need to be repre-
sented.
"I think it makes for a better
public voice if we have a complete
population chiming in," Rosen-

It's a risky move on the part of Judd Apa-
tow ("Knocked Up") to
name his latest film "Funny * -**
People." After all, if the
film is colossally un-funny, Funny
then it's just going to be
embarrassing for everyone
involved. Luckily for him, At Quality16
the movie is funny. In fact, and Showcase
it's very funny. Universal
What the film's trail-
er doesn't reveal is that
there's a strong element of sadness within
"Dude... 'Click What the fuck?"

(Seth Rogen, "Observe and Report"), a strug-
gling comedian who is overly enthusiastic to
become Simmons's assistant. Soon, Wright
also becomes Simmons's confidant as Sim-
mons reveals his secret: He has a rare form
of leukemia and is slowly dying.
Can a comedy successfully combine leuke-
mia and laughs? It may sound surprising, but
Apatow's writing makes it work.
The film often veers, sometimes precari-
ously, between hearty laughter and tears.
But the effect isn't as jarring as one might
think. During the more upbeat moments
(mainly the stand-up routines of both San-
dler and Rogen), it seems a shame that
eventually the fun will have to end and the
film will have to return to its rather morose

simply can't figure out when to end his films
(admit it, most of his movies are about 20-25
minutes too long). The problem with "Funny
People" is that there are simply too many
funny people (sorry, couldn't help it) and
Apatow wants desperately to include them
all. This leads to several entertaining but
unnecessary scenes involving - and this is
just a very small sample - Andy Dick, Paul
Reiser, Norm MacDonald and Ray Romano.
But on the plus side, Romano's brief cameo
is funnier than anything he has ever done in
his own films.
At times, "Funny People" feels like sev-
eral movies thrown into one. One portion
involves the relationship Wright has with
his two roommates Leo Koenig (Jonah

to become a better man when faced with
his disease. All of these different aspects
work very well by themselves, but there
isn't nearly enough time for deep character
development.
Regardless, the relationship between
Simmons and Wright remains interesting
throughout. There's something special about
seeing two funny people (again, couldn't help
it) interact with each other, and the scenes
with the pair seem more like two friends
hanging out than actors reciting their lines.
It's this casual attitude that makes "Funny
People" seem less like a movie and more like
a well-produced viral video of comedians
riffing off of each other. This is truly anoth-
er hit for the Apatow camp.

The longest summer of all time

By KAVI PANDEY
Daily Arts Writer
One of the smash hits of the 2009 Sun-
dance Film Festival, "(500) Days of Sum-
mer," has finally made its long-awaited
release into cinemas nationwide. The film
follows greeting-card company employ-
ee Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt,
"Brick") and his relationship with the
girl of his dreams, Summer Finn (Zooey
Deschanel, "Yes Man"), to understand why
it failed.
As a decidedly unconventional roman-
tic comedy, it may seem unusual for "(500)
days" to be released among the season's
typical popcorn movies. But in an inter-
view with The Daily, the two stars of the
film affirmed that this was the perfect time
to release the film.
"This is at heart a very entertaining film
... if you're looking for something a little bit
more lighthearted," Deschanel said.
Gordon-Levitt added, "It's a really good
summer movie ... a few less timpani drums

and blood, and more Joy Division and kiss-
ing. What summer blockbuster has Joy
Division and kissing?"
Gordon-Levitt explained how easy it
was to work with fellow independent-film
mainstay Zooey Deschanel.
"I was really just playing a guy whose
modus operandi was 'I'm madly in love
with this girl,' and she's easy to play madly
in love with," said Gordon-Levitt.
"I kind of just focused on her, listened to
She & Him in the morning ... it was easy,"
he added.
Brief segments of the trailer hint at some
"larger-than-life" elements, like a cartoon
bird and an elaborate dance sequence.
But, as the actors explained, they were all
incorporated for a specific and admirable
purpose.
"It all comes from a sincere point of view,"
Gordon-Levitt said. "Even the most surreal
parts, like the dance number. It's because ...
I know how it feels when you got to finally
be with the girl you've had a crush on for so
long, and it feels like that."

While many of today's romantic com-
edies brazenly try to be "quirky" and "dif-
ferent," "(500) Days of Summer" isn't afraid
to accept some of the conventions of its
genre.
Gordon-Levitt:
'(Deschanel) is easy
to play
madly in love with.'
"I think (the film) doesn't so much avoid
clichas - it walks right up to them and has
a conversation with them," said Gordon-
Levitt. "It follows some and deviates from
other ones and that's what I like about it.
With avoiding cliches, then you just start
becoming obscure."

"Also, if your goal is to not be something,
that's not a goal that's too amorphous,"
Deschanel added. "My only goal is to not be
this ... well you're already not that. If you
aim for something - something actual -
then you're not thinking about what you
are not."
Both Deschanel and Gordon-Levitt shied
away from giving their own interpretations
of the film.
"I don't really like to tell people what
they should take away because I like to
go see a movie and be allowed to feel,"
Deschanel said. "It's a sacred relationship
the audience has with the artist."
"It's best to do my part and then hand it
over to those that are going to experience
it because it's a very personal experience,"
she added.
"I think it's a more 20th-century attitude
that watching a movie is 'I am an audience
member' and it's a passive thing," Gordon-
Levitt added. "I think that watching a
movie can be and ought to be a creative act.
You come up with what it means."

Then there's Denard Robinson,
who didn't have the pleasure of
spending the winter semester in
Ann Arbor, like Forcier. But he's
got a pretty strong arm and can
flat-out run.
Ideally, I would like to see Robin-
son become a sort of change-of-pace
guy who comes in for 10 to 15 plays
a game, because I don't think he's
going to be too ready this season.
"I haven't seen Denard yet,"
Rodriguez said at Big Ten Media
Day. "It's going to be fun to watch
(him and Forcier)."
Robinson just hasn't had the
same time to become as familiar-
ized with the playbook as Forcier.
Rodriguez hasn't even been able
to assess him and still won't until
well into August. But he can defi-
nitely make a contribution to the
team.
It's going to be very frustrating
for a team to have to prepare for
both Forcier and Robinson - even
if Robinson is only playing a few
snaps a game.
And as much as I think Sheri-
dan is a good guy and Michigan
fans should be thankful that he
stepped up last year - even though
he had his troubles - the best role
he could have in 2009 is as an
impromptu quarterbacks coach.
Key Losses - Steven Threet,
transfer to Arizona State
Projected starter - Tate Forcier
Newcomer(s) to watch - Forcier
and Denard Robinson
Overall impressions It'll be an
interesting season for the quarter-
backs, to be sure. There will be ups
and there will most certainly be
downs, but it will be fun. Michigan
fans should take pleasure in seeing
Forcier develop in front of their
eyes - because by his senior cam-
paign, he'll definitely be a star.
