UPDATE – 8 p.m. Oct. 3
No individual is in custody 

following 
a 
shooting 
threat 

against women at the University 
of Michigan, Mara Schneider, 
special agent for the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation with the 
Detroit field office, confirmed in 
a Oct. 3 7:40 p.m. email to The 
Michigan Daily.

“We are still collecting & 

reviewing evidence to determine 
whether the threat was made 
in violation of either state or 
federal law,” Schneider wrote. 
“There won’t be a referral to a 
prosecutor’s office until that 
review is complete.”

ORIGINAL STORY – 7:09 

p.m. Oct. 3

Classes and activities at the 

University of Michigan will take 
place “as scheduled” on Oct. 
4, University President Mark 
Schlissel announced the evening 
of Oct. 4 in an email addressed 
to members of the campus 
community. Many on campus 
have been shaken by the shooter 
threat against women that was 
anonymously 
posted 
on 
the 

Russian confession platform Sinn 
List, which circulated on social 
media on Oct. 2. 

According to Schlissel’s email, 

the individual who posted the 
“bigoted and misogynistic” threat 
is located on the East Coast. 

The Division of Public Safety 
and 
Security 
had 
previously 

announced that “there is nothing 
to indicate imminent harm to our 
community.”

“What we know today from 

the FBI is that the threat has been 
mitigated, and there is no current 
or pending threat based on the 
post,” Schlissel wrote.

Mara 
Schneider, 
special 

agent for the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation with the Detroit 
field office, wrote in a statement 
to The Michigan Daily that the 
FBI interviewed the individual 
determined to be responsible 
for the post and found that there 
was no threat to the University 
community. 

“Special 
agents 
from 
the 

FBI’s 
Baltimore 
Division, 

which covers the entire states 
of 
Maryland 
and 
Delaware, 

contacted the individual, who 
has 
been 
cooperative 
with 

law 
enforcement,” 
Schneider 

wrote. “During the interview, 
agents assessed the individual 
had neither the means nor the 
opportunity to carry out the 
threat.”

An update from DPSS posted 

at 6:50pm on Oct. 3 reiterated the 
FBI’s statement that there is no 
current threat to the community.

“DPSS is confident that any 

threat from the post has been 
addressed 
and 
mitigated,” 

DPSS Executive Director Eddie 
Washington said in the statement. 

University of Michigan President 

Mark Schlissel will step down from 
his presidency beginning in June 
2023, a year earlier than initially 
planned. 

In a tweet Oct. 5, Schlissel said 

his decision to announce that he was 
stepping down now would allow for 
“a smooth & thoughtful leadership 
transition.”

“The work we do matters,” 

Schlissel wrote. “It’s work that the 
president of this university has the 

immense privilege of leading and 
being a part of. Every day we heal, 
discover, teach and serve – advancing 
a public mission and strengthening 
the immutable Michigan bond of 
knowledge and values.”

Schlissel also said he decided this 

timing is appropriate after discussion 
with the Board of Regents. 

“The new horizon gives the Board 

time to consult with our community, 
think about the future and thoroughly 
plan and conduct a search for my 
successor, while allowing us to 
continue momentum on important 
and time-critical efforts that are 

underway,” Schlissel said. 

The Detroit Free Press reported 

that tensions between the regents and 
Schlissel had “reached a boiling point” 
in September 2021 after Schlissel 
failed to communicate with the board 
about the status of the failed Detroit 
Center for Innovation project. A week 
after the Free Press report, the board 
gave Schlissel a 3% pay raise for the 
upcoming year. 

Schlissel first took office in July 

2014 and was previously provost of 
Brown University. 

Schlissel’s accomplishments as 

president include creating the Go Blue 

Guarantee to make a U-M education 
free for in-state students from families 
below Michigan’s median income 
and then expanding to it the Flint 
and Dearborn campuses — with a 
controversial GPA requirement for 
those two campuses — after years of 
student activism. He also promised 
complete carbon neutrality for the 
University by 2040 after extensive 
activism by the campus community, 
which included arrests of some 
student activists.

Tensions 
ran 
high 
at 
the 

Faculty Senate meeting Oct. 4 
on as University of Michigan 
administration 
and 
faculty 

members discussed five motions 
related to the University’s sexual 
misconduct response, the absence 
of options for remote instruction 
this 
semester 
and 
COVID-19 

protocols on campus.

Discussion 
of 
the 
motions 

first started in September when 
faculty sent them to University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
and 

Provost Susan Collins. Schlissel 
responded to the motions in an 
email to Faculty Senate on Sept. 30, 
backing the University’s decision 
to return to large in-person classes 
and mentioning the new sexual 
misconduct policy introduced Sept. 
23.

The first motion calls on the 

University to reinstate COVID-19 
protections like social distancing 
and asks for greater flexibility for 
faculty to teach remotely. Currently, 
masks are required in all indoor 
University spaces. Though students 
must wear masks during classes, 
social distancing is not enforced.

Faculty 
are 
asking 
for 

greater teaching flexibility to be 
implemented through changing 
Work Connections, the University’s 
disability management program, 
to allow faculty with disabilities or 

health conditions to teach remotely.

LSA 
professor 
Silke-Maria 

Weineck spoke in favor of Motion 
1, saying that Work Connections 
currently has too much power to 
decide whether faculty have to 
teach in-person or not. Weineck 
said the University should not make 
faculty go against their physician’s 
medical advice or force them to 
teach in-person if they have a pre-
existing condition that makes them 
more vulnerable to COVID-19.

“A case management at Work 

Connections has the power to 
overrule your doctor and inform 
your dean that you must suck it 
up — there’s no appeal,” Weineck 
said. 
“Deans 
can, 
in 
theory, 

ignore the determinations, but in 
practice, they defer to them, so the 
most vulnerable amongst us have 
faced the choice to work and live 
in constant fear or to lose their 
livelihood. This includes LEO 
faculty — we don’t have a vote today 
and staff who don’t have a vote 
anywhere.”

In his email to the Faculty 

Senate, 
Schlissel 
said 
Work 

Connections 
has 
reviewed 
28 

“formal requests” to teach remotely 
“out of a total of 8,500 instructional 
faculty members across all three 
U-M campuses.” 

According 
to 
Schlissel, 
of 

those 28, 20 were rejected, 4 
were accepted as “needing some 
enhanced accommodations,” 2 are 
awaiting more information from 
the applicants, 1 was withdrawn 
and 1 was unrelated to COVID-19.

In 1972, Michigan resident 

Amy Nowland flew to New York, 
where 
the 
most 
permissive 

women’s 
reproductive 
health 

laws in the country existed at 
the time, to undergo an abortion. 
Nowland received the procedure 
a year prior to the U.S. Supreme 
Court’s ruling in Roe v. Wade, a 
1973 landmark decision declaring 
that the Consitution granted all 
women the liberty to have an 
abortion. 

Nowland, who spoke in front 

of a crowd at a Women’s March 
protest on Oct. 2, recalled her 
mother’s disapproval, saying she 
would not fly to New York with 
Nowland and instead sent a friend 
with her. When she returned to 
Michigan after the procedure, 
Nowland 
said 
her 
mother 

refused to talk to her about the 
experience.

“I did not grieve having the 

abortion,” 
Nowland 
said. 
“I 

grieved the little 17-year-old that 
had to do it on her own.”

Nowland 
was 
one 
of 
the 

hundreds gathered at the protest 

in front of the Federal Building 
in Ann Arbor, rallying for the 
protection of reproductive rights 
for women. 

The protest in Ann Arbor 

was one of over 600 Women’s 
Marches 
across 
the 
country 

on Oct. 2. These protests are 
in response to the passage of 
Texas Senate Bill 8, also known 
as the Texas Heartbeat Act, in 
September, which banned nearly 
all abortions in the state. The act 
prohibits all abortions in which 
cardiac activity is present, which 
usually occurs after six weeks of 
fetal development. 

Last 
month, 
the 
Justice 

Department sued Texas over 
the law, arguing that its intent 
was to violate the constitution. A 
federal judge heard from lawyers 
representing the State of Texas 
and the Justice Department on 
Oct. 1 debating whether or not to 
pause the ban while the courts 
determine its legality. 

In a 5-4 vote, the Supreme 

Court decided not to block the 
law last month, shortly after it 
went into effect. 

Ahead of new Supreme Court term, 
protest supports reproductive rights

Content Warning: sexual assault 
Peter Chen, former professor of 

Electrical Engineering and Com-
puter Science at the University of 
Michigan, appeared in the 22nd 
Circuit Court of Washtenaw Coun-
ty on Sept. 30 afternoon for a pre-
trial hearing. 

Chen is charged with crimi-

nal sexual misconduct of the first 
degree, a felony that could carry a 
sentence of life imprisonment. He 
will stand trial Jan. 31 at 8:30 a.m. 

At the pre-trial hearing Sept. 30, 

prosecutor Andrew Childers and 
Chen’s lawyer, Mariell Lehman, 
stated no agreements had been 
made regarding the case. They both 
thought there would be no resolu-
tion and jointly recommended to 
the court that the case proceeds to 

trial. 

Judge Darlene O’Brien, who pre-

sided over the case, said there will 
be a final pre-trial hearing on Dec. 
16. In the meantime, all of Chen’s 
bond conditions — remaining out of 
custody on personal recognizance 
and restricted access with minors 
— continue to apply.

At 
a 
preliminary 
examina-

tion in Ann Arbor’s 15th District 
Court in July, Judge Miriam Perry 
found that probable cause existed 
to believe the crime of criminal 
sexual conduct of the first degree 
occurred and that Chen committed 
the crime. The case then proceeded 
to the 22nd Circuit Court.

Allegations against Chen sur-

faced less than a year after sexual 
misconduct 
allegations 
against 

CSE professor Jason Mars, which 
triggered calls for Mars’ removal 
and an uproar from students. Chen 
became the interim chair of CSE 

following the departure of Brian 
Noble, who abruptly stepped down 
in February 2020. Chen resigned 
only six months later due to “per-
sonal reasons.”

The department has dealt with 

other allegations of sexual miscon-
duct against former CSE professor 
Walter Lasecki, whose resignation 
took effect in August.

Shannon Smith, who is listed as 

Chen’s attorney on the court dock-
et, was not present at the hearing. 
Lehman and Smith’s firm, Smith 
Lehman, represents Chen and 
specializes in criminal sexual mis-
conduct allegations. Smith will be 
present at the trial in January. 

Smith represented the now-

convicted Larry Nassar, who faced 
more than 150 sexual miscon-
duct allegations from his time as 
a professor at Michigan State Uni-
versity’s College of Osteopathic 
Medicine and USA National Gym-

nastics team doctor. 

In a January 2021 statement to 

The Daily, Lehman said that Chen 
denied the allegations against him.

“(Chen) completely denies the 

allegations and has cooperated 
fully with (AAPD) to assist them 
in their investigation,” Lehman 
wrote. “Mr. Chen is confident that 
the truth will prevail and that he 
will be exonerated fully. Mr. Chen 
thanks the numerous people who 
have reached out in support of him 
over the last few days.”

A previous version of this story 

incorrectly stated Nassar was a 
professor at Michigan State Uni-
versity’s College of Human Medi-
cine. It has been corrected to 
reflect he was a professor at Mich-
igan State University’s College of 
Osteopathic Medicine.

Content Warning: sexual assault
The Michigan House Oversight 

Committee held a hearing Sept. 30 
to discuss two new house bills to 
empower sexual assault survivors 
to file suit for damages. Victims 
of late University of Michigan 
athletic doctor Robert Anderson 
and former USA Gymnastics and 
Michigan State University doctor 
Larry Nassar spoke in testimony 
before the committee to express 
their full support for these bills. 

The 
two 
bills, 
known 
as 

Michigan’s 
Empowering 

Survivors 
legislative 
package, 

was originally introduced on 
Sept. 16, 2020 and reintroduced in 
early 2021 by Rep. Ryan Berman, 
R-Commerce 
Township, 
and 

Rep. Karen Whitsett, D-Detroit. 
It consists of two bills aimed 
at protecting victims of sexual 
assault. The legislative package 
has 
also 
received 
bipartisan 

support from legislators.

One of the two new house 

bills included in the legislative 
package, 
HB 
4307, 
prevents 

schools from claiming immunity 
when the abuse took place “under 
the guise of medical care and 
the school knew or should have 
known,” Berman said.

Berman 
spoke 
about 
the 

importance of reevaluating the 
laws to ensure they are protecting 
community members.

“We need to look again … at the 

laws we have in place,” Berman 
said. “Are they adequate? Does 
there need to be a change? If there’s 
criminal sexual conduct from a 
government agency or agent and 
someone either knew about it or 
should have known about it and 

they didn’t do anything to prevent 
it and they allowed it to continue 
occurring, then there should be 
some liability. They shouldn’t be 
able to hide behind the shield of 
governmental immunity.”

Rep. Pat Outman, R-Six Lakes, 

brought 
up 
concerns 
about 

HB 4307 being overly broad, 
especially 
pertaining 
to 
the 

section that states that a school 
“should have known” about abuse.

The other bill, HB 4360, 

proposes an amendment to the 
statute of limitations to allow 
for a one-year window for those 
abused while undergoing medical 
care to file a suit. This is similar 
to the 90-day window previously 
allowed by state law for MSU’s 
Nassar survivors.

Trinea Gonczar, director at 

Avalon Healing Center, was the 
first to testify at the hearing as 
a victim of Nassar. She spoke 
about how long it took her to 
acknowledge her assault and 
the importance of amending the 
statute of limitations.

“I had to come to terms with the 

fact that my entire childhood was 
a lie,” Gonczar said. “As a 37-year-
old woman … watching the other 
brave girls and young women 
speak their truth and sharing 
their impact statements one-by-
one with almost identical stories 
(to) mine … assault takes time to 
process. Just because someone 
was raped early as a child, they 
should not be penalized. They 
should still be protected and 
offered justice.”

Former U-M football player 

Jon Vaughn spoke on his assaults 
during 
his 
testimony 
and 

announced his support for the 
legislative package.

“We trusted our doctors, and 

especially trusted U-M doctors 

— who wouldn’t?” Vaughn said. 
“Now in 2021 as a 51-year-old 
man, I know that we were abused, 
assaulted, raped.”

Brixie spoke about the variety 

of reasons many victims do not 
initially come forward after their 
assault, 
including 
PTSD 
and 

threats from the perpetrator.

“It’s important to remember 

that prior to the 2018 reforms, 
folks who are survivors only had 
three years to come forward,” 
Brixie said. “We in the state of 
Michigan, and our laws, are partly 
to blame for serial sex abusers 
being harbored as a result of our 
laws.”

Rep. 
Steven 
Johnson, 

R-Wayland, said the committee 
should ensure that the bills include 
some degree of protections for 
those accused of misconduct. 

“It’s a tough line to walk here 

where you’re trying to make sure 
you protect the survivors while 
also the innocent,” Johnson said. 
“That’s why it’s a very difficult 
package of bills here to make sure 
that we get this right, so encourage 
the committee to be very active 
in this to make sure that we can 
thread the needle to look out for 
the victims while at the same time 
protecting the innocent.”

The University has received 

backlash for its lack of action 
against Anderson after receiving 
complaints from students..There 
have been recent demands for the 
University to take responsibility 
for Anderson’s actions, including 
at the most recent Board of 
Regents meeting.

WilmerHale, the firm hired 

by the University to investigate 
Anderson’s misconduct, found 
that complaints about Anderson 
traceback to 1966.

Gonczar 
spoke 
about 
this 

historical inaction on the part of 
the University.

“These 
institutions 
have 

shamed, 
blamed 
and 
only 

protected themselves, which in 
turn is the exact way to attract 
predatory behavior to not only 
flourish, but to be welcomed,” 
Gonczar said. “Immunity for state 
universities gives no incentive to 
change for the better.”

Vaughn explained that several 

U-M officials, including former 
football coach Bo Schembechler, 
were 
aware 
of 
Anderson’s 

misconduct and chose not to act 
on the allegations.

“They made a choice not to 

protect us,” Vaugn said. “Instead, 
the University enabled our abuse.”

Tad 
DeLuca, 
former 
U-M 

wrestler, also testified and shared 
the mental and physical effects 
that his assaults had on him. 
During his time at the University, 
DeLuca reported Anderson to his 
coach but was turned away. 

After writing an official letter to 

report Anderson, athletic director 
Don Canham suspended DeLuca 
from the wrestling program and 
took away his full-ride scholarship, 
which was paying for his out-of-
state tuition. According to DeLuca, 
since 
the 
WilmerHale 
report 

came out in May 2021, current 
University employees have denied 
the allegations and the content of 
the report, attacking victims who 
have spoken out.

“The 
lesson 
was 
clear,” 

DeLuca said. “If you try to stand 
up for yourself and do the right 
thing, Michigan will destroy 
you. They will pound you down. 
They did.”

GOVERNMENT


Having just transferred 

from 
Plekhanov 
Russian 

University of Economics in 
Moscow, Russia, LSA junior 
Veronika Volevich was look-
ing forward to attending her 
first football game in The 
Big House. She made a post 
in the “Buying and Selling 
Tickets UMich” Facebook 
group on Sept. 4 requesting 
that anyone selling tickets to 
the football games on Sept. 
11 or Sept. 18 comment or 
contact her privately.

Within a few minutes, 

Volevich said she got a mes-

sage from Facebook user 

“Elena Beretta.” Beretta told 
Volevich she had tickets for 
both games in Section 31, 
Row 10 and asked Volevich 
to make an offer. Volevich 
suggested $40 per ticket and 
said 
Beretta 
immediately 

accepted.

But an hour after Volevich 

electronically paid Beretta 
for the tickets, Volevich said 
she still had not received 
them. When Beretta stopped 
responding to her private 
messages, Volevich realized 
it had been a scam.

“Then I decided to make 

a post about (Beretta) in the 
(Buying and Selling) group,” 
Volevich said. “I received 
three or four messages from 
other people saying … she 
had used the same exact 
strategy on them.”

Associate Athletic Direc-

tor Kurt Svoboda confirmed 
in an email to The Michigan 
Daily that this is the first 
year that student football 
tickets have been solely dis-
tributed online. Ice hockey 
and basketball student tick-
ets have been virtual since 
2019.

“We do not have plans to 

return to physical tickets in 
the future but we will con-
tinue to follow best prac-
tices within the industry 
to provide security within 
the 
ticketing 
landscape,” 

Svoboda 
wrote. 
“Mobile 

ticketing is proven to be far 
more safe and effective than 
paper tickets as it relates to 
authenticity.”

Volevich is not the only 

student who has recently 
been scammed while try-
ing to buy student tickets 
through social media.

After talking to several 

other students with similar 
experiences to Volevich, The 
Michigan Daily found three 
major warning signs to look 
out for — and ways to miti-
gate the risks — when trying 
to buy student tickets online.

“I know I’ll never get my 

money back,” Volevich said. 
“I just want to warn other 
people so this doesn’t hap-
pen to them.”

Red Flag 1: Pressuring 

the buyer to pay the full 
cost before sending the 
ticket

LSA sophomore Audrey 

Beach was scammed on Aug. 
21 while trying to purchase 
an entire season of student 
tickets through the Buying 
and Selling Facebook group. 
Beach said a scammer by the 
name of “Reilly Kat” liked 
Beach’s post in the group, 
so Beach reached out to 
her to purchase the tickets. 
Once they agreed on a price, 
Beach said Kat told her to set 
up a Zelle account and trans-
fer the money immediately if 
she wanted the tickets.

“She was definitely pres-

suring me into paying right 
away, like as soon as pos-
sible, and to get a different 
payment app that was better 
for her,” Beach said.

Beach said she was out 

shopping 
with 
her 
fam-

ily at the time and told Kat 
she wanted to wait until she 
got home to set up a Zelle 
account on her laptop. Kat 
insinuated she would sell 

the tickets to someone else 
if Beach took too long, sug-
gesting she use her phone to 
transfer the payment if she 
was serious about buying.

Since there were no live 

spectators at football games 
last fall, this was Beach’s 
first time purchasing tick-
ets to a U-M football game. 
She said if she had known 
more about how tickets were 
transferred, the value of 
season tickets or the tricks 
scammers 
traditionally 

used, she would have been 
more careful.

“If I had that experience 

last year, if I had ever been 
to a football game … I defi-
nitely would have had a bet-
ter understanding of what I 
was trying to buy and how to 
do it safely,” Beach said.

To protect both buyers 

and sellers from losing the 
full value of the tickets, 
Beach and other scam vic-
tims suggested sending half 
of the cost before receiving 
the tickets and the other half 
after.

Red Flag 2: Asking that 

money be sent through 
new payment applications

All of the scam victims 

interviewed by The Daily 
said 
the 
PayPal-owned 

application Venmo — a mid-
dle ground between a pay-
ment transfer service and 
social media platform — is 
their preferred interface for 
virtual 
payments. 
Venmo 

appears frequently in lists 
of the applications college 
students use on a daily basis, 
and a third of Venmo users 
are between the ages of 18 
and 24.

Volevich 
said 
Beretta 

refused to use Venmo when 
they were discussing how 
the payment would be sent.

“(Beretta) said she would 

prefer either Zelle or Apple 
Pay,” Volevich said. “I found 
that weird since everyone 
has Venmo.”

Volevich said she consent-

ed to using Apple Pay since 
she had used it previously to 
make contactless payments 
at local businesses. When 
a pop-up warning screen 
appeared 
indicating 
that 

this particular Apple Pay 
transfer might not be safe, 
Volevich said, she assumed 
Apple Pay flagged any non-
commercial 
transfer 
and 

dismissed it.

“When 
I 
started 
the 

Apple Pay transaction, I was 
warned by Apple that this 
might be fraud,” Volevich 
said. “I assumed that since 
I’m transferring money to 
another person, Apple Pay 
might just suspect fraud, so 
I didn’t pay attention to it.”

Besides paying attention 

to explicit security messages 
from payment apps, Volev-
ich and other scam victims 
recommended 
telling 
the 

seller they are not comfort-
able using certain payment 
methods they are less famil-
iar with. They also sug-
gested that if the buyer and 
seller can arrange to meet 
in person while the trans-
action takes place, it would 
increase transparency and 
reduce scam risks.

“I would ask the (seller) 

to meet in person,” Volevich 
said. “Since all (students) 
live in Ann Arbor mostly, it’s 
not that hard to meet in per-
son.”

Red Flag 3: Facebook 

account is not active and 
person’s student status is 
unclear

If they had paid better 

attention to key details on 
the 
scammer’s 
Facebook 

pages, all of the scam vic-
tims said they might not 
have been so quick to send 
money to strangers.

2019 
University 
alum 

Zena Shunnar told The Daily 
when she was a student, she 
had never heard of scams 

involving tickets to U-M 
sporting events. But when 
she was scammed while try-
ing to buy three tickets over 
Facebook from a “fellow 
alum” to the Sept. 11 game, 
Shunnar said she found out 
the hard way that things had 
changed.

Shunnar messaged “Sim-

one Williams” who claimed 
she had tickets available. 
Williams’ profile mentioned 
she 
had 
recently 
moved 

to Paris and had studied 
at École Polytechnique de 
Milan in Milan, Italy. Shun-
nar said she thought this was 
odd, but gave Williams the 
benefit of the doubt, suppos-
ing Williams wanted to sell 
her tickets because of her 
current residence in Europe.

“I kind of made up the 

story in my head on why she 
could be selling these tickets 
and why it says she lives in 
Paris now,” Shunnar said.

LSA senior Julia Smoot 

said 
the 
individual 
who 

scammed her had very few 
Facebook friends and only 
had posted a couple of times 
— with each post receiving 
zero likes. Similar to Shun-
nar, Smoot said she had also 
purchased paper tickets sev-
eral times before and had 
never had any issues.

Both recommended taking 

more time to identify incon-
sistencies on the Facebook 
profiles of prospective sell-
ers or buyers. They also both 
suggested using MCommu-
nity to verify their student 
or alumni status.

“I 
started 
looking 
up 

(student ticket sellers) in 
MCommunity and I found at 
least two other people who 
didn’t go here,” Smoot said. 
“This one guy just kept say-
ing, ‘you’re safe with me, 
you’re safe with me.’ He did 
not go here.”

To try to make the veri-

fication process easier for 
students, LSA senior Mark 
Zubricki 
and 
Engineer-

ing senior Connor Turco 
launched SurfSeats at the 
beginning of the fall semes-
ter. With more than 500 
registered users, SurfSeats 
is an online ticket market-
place that is only accessible 
to those who sign up with a 
University-affiliated 
email 

address. 

Though 
Michigan 
Ath-

letics 
is 
partnered 
with 

Stubbhub to provide a secure 
platform 
for 
non-student 

ticket sales, Turco said there 
was a need for a student-ori-
ented marketplace.

“We noticed that there 

were a lot of people getting 
scammed in the group chats 
and we thought there was an 
opportunity to build a better 
ticket platform for students 
to sell their tickets,” Turco 
said.

SurfSeats facilitates pay-

ment 
through 
PayPal 
or 

Venmo, and all tickets are 
“insured.” If there are any 
issues with listers not trans-
ferring tickets, Truco said 
SurfSeats will replace the 
ticket or refund the buyer 
the full amount.

“(SurfSeats) 
has 
been 

pretty 
good 
so 
far, 
we 

haven’t had any scammers,” 
Truco said.

Whether students switch 

to new virtual marketplaces 
like SurfSeats or continue 
to buy and sell in Facebook 
groups, 
those 
who 
were 

scammed said they hope 
their “scam stories” will 
raise awareness about com-
mon scammer tactics. With 
mobile tickets here to stay, 
Beach said taking basic pre-
cautionary measures while 
shopping is a small price to 
pay to help ensure monetary 
security.

“I hope everyone stays 

safe if they’re trying to buy 
(tickets) off of a Facebook 
group,” Beach said.

District was among first in state to require weekly testing for 
unvaccinated staff as delta variant spread across Michigan

ANN ARBOR
Some parents ask AAPS 
to mandate vaccinations

Parents of Ann Arbor Pub-

lic Schools are calling on 
school leaders to mandate 
COVID-19 vaccination for its 
employees. AAPS was among 
the first districts in Michi-
gan to require unvaccinated 
employees to submit to week-
ly testing in July.

AAPS 
parent 
Danielle 

Stockton said she believes 
weekly testing for unvac-
cinated 
employees 
is 
not 

enough to mitigate the spread 
of 
COVID-19 
and 
thinks 

AAPS should begin requiring 
its employees to get vaccinat-
ed to continue working in the 
school system.

“If anything should remain 

open, besides businesses and 
everything else, it should be 
schools for children for in-
person learning, for those 
who need it,” Stockton said. 
“Especially special educa-
tion 
and 
special 
needsw 

where at-home learning is 
not feasible.”

The 
vaccinate-or-test 

model 
is 
consistent 
with 

the Biden administration’s 
recent 
vaccine 
mandate. 

However, some AAPS par-
ents like Stockton say this 
does not go far enough.

In a Sept. 13 email obtained 

by The Michigan Daily, AAPS 
Superintendent 
Jeanice 

Swift told an AAPS parent 
that the district is increas-
ing its support for vaccine 
uptake among its current and 
new staff, but no staff vac-
cine mandate has been put in 
place.

“Following the recent FDA 

approval of the Pfizer vac-
cine and the President’s sub-
sequent call for vaccines last 
Thursday evening, (AAPS is) 
continuing to increase our 

support to compel continu-
ing and new team members 
arriving in our system during 
back-to-school hiring season 
to ensure they are fully vac-
cinated,” Swift wrote. “At 
this time we have achieved 
extremely high rates of vac-
cination among our AAPS 
school staff.” 

Currently, the district has 

seen 56 total COVID-19 cases 
across the school system 
since the fall semester began 
on Aug. 27. However, cases 
have trended upwards in 
recent weeks, with 23 cases 
reported for the week of Sep. 
24, the highest case count for 
any week since the semester 
started. Officials at Dicken 
Elementary announced this 
past week that one class-
room would switch to remote 
learning following two posi-
tive cases.

Stockton pointed to the 

upward trend as a reason to 
pursue 
staff 
vaccinations 

more aggressively — espe-
cially in elementary schools 
where some students are 
ineligible to be vaccinated, as 
the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention currently 
recommends only children 12 
years and up to get the Pfizer 
COVID-19 vaccine. On Sept. 
28, Pfizer Inc. submitted ini-
tial trial data for vaccinating 
5-11 year olds and will submit 
a request for emergency use 
in the coming weeks, though 
approval could be stalled 
until Halloween to Thanks-
giving. 

“If cases are on the rise 

within schools, this is a per-
fect example of (asking), 
‘OK, what can we do to not 
let this happen to other ele-
mentary schools and some 
middle schools?’” Stockton 
said. “Obviously, (the ele-
mentary and middle schools) 
are probably more of the hot 
spots than the high schools, 

just because of the availabil-
ity of the vaccine for older 
kids.”

AAPS does not publish 

vaccination data from its 
employees, 
citing 
HIPAA 

protections. District officials 
did not immediately reply to 
a Michigan Daily request for 
comment.

In an email to Kate Swee-

ney, an Ann Arbor resi-
dent and Stockton’s mother, 
whose grandchild is enrolled 
in the AAPS district, Swift 
defended 
the 
district’s 

existing policy, saying it is 
among the most stringent in 
the state. Sweeney said she 
believed vaccines are the 
most effective way to protect 
the AAPS community and 
was frustrated by the dis-
trict’s decision to implement 
the vaccinate-or-test model. 

“It’s an elementary con-

cept, mandatory vaccines,” 
Sweeney said. “I just feel like 
(AAPS) should be taking the 
leadership role.”

Sweeney said it is impor-

tant for school employees to 
be vaccinated so kids who 
rely on their schools for sup-
port can continue attending 
in person.

“These 
kids 
have 
been 

through a lot with virtual 
school 
(with) 
the 
experi-

ence of learning over the past 
year,” Sweeney said. “I think 
the staff was doing the best 
that they could, but it still was 
not replacing the experience 
of face-to-face learning. And 
it’s pretty important when 
you see changes in kids now 
being back and how impor-
tant that is for their learning 
and social development.”

Some parents are asking that the Ann Arbor Public Schools require vaccinations for all employees.

To avoid scam, avoid these three main warning signs 

when buying passes through groups on Facebook


Rarely is the energy of a whole band so 

understandable in a phone call. Perhaps that is 
one of the most special parts about Tank and the 
Bangas: They can communicate their energy full 
of hope, love and strength through any medium, 
down to storytelling over the phone. Joshua 
Johnson, the group’s drummer and musical 
director, took a moment to chat with The Daily a 
few days ahead of the band’s show at The Blind Pig 
on Wednesday, Sept. 22. 

The band energy builds strongly off of the 

poetic roots of lead singer Tarriona “Tank” Ball. As 
Johnson told me, when performing live, “To me, 
it keeps her grounded in that space, that ‘I know 
what I’m doing,’ and it’s like a confidence thing. 
It comes out, no question, and it always seems to 
touch the crowd (in a) certain way, so I love seeing 
that happen.” After all, several members of the 
band met at an open mic at Blackstar, a bookstore 
and coffee shop in New Orleans, where Ball was 
reciting her poetry. 

The Blind Pig concert itself was interspersed 

with powerful moments of clarity, as Ball boomed 
spoken word poetry out over the crowd. The band 

worked as a true unit, following each other and 
the path that their songs wanted to take when 
performed live. Johnson described his “psychic 
connection” with his brother, Jonathan Johnson, 
the bass player, and another founding band 
member, Norman Spence, on bass and synth keys. 
“I can look at him, or I could just say a certain word 
that may not make sense … everybody knows 
exactly what we’re looking for, you know, it’s really 
cool,” Johnson said. But a lot of the time, he went 
on to explain, it is when that connection fails once 
every so often that they learn from each other. “A 
lot of times we find new ideas for music that way, 
honestly,” Johnson confided.

But in that small, crowded room, these ties 

were immediately obvious, never failing once. 
The way this band works live is by feeding off of 
each other’s energy and that of the crowd. They 
never play a song the same way twice. You know 
all their songs by heart, have everything off of their 
albums memorized? Great. Throw that all out of 
the window, because it’s going to sound completely 
different live. Ball’s confidence on stage was the 
kind that extends to the whole room. She held the 
hands of audience members, whooped, called and 
thrilled with humor and playful affection, allowing 
her listeners to hold her same attitude, even if just 
for two hours. 

The other band members threw their whole 

bodies into their performance (often literally). 
Albert Allenback, on flute and alto saxophone, 
drew eyes to him with his gaspingly passionate 
solos and cheerfully exaggerated energy. Johnson 
himself was clearly the anchor to which all strings 
were tied, playing with a big grin on his face but 
watchful eyes. And when asked the difference 
between playing a show and just jamming on 
their own, he answered truthfully, “They would 
say that they have the energy of the crowd. I’ll be 
honest — for me it feels the same. A lot of times 
it feels just like I’m with them, and people are 
watching now.”

This humbleness translates through to the 

band’s mentality. “Before every show we at least get 
a prayer in, and we’re thankful, you know what I’m 
saying, we have a lot to be thankful for,” Johnson 
made sure to tell me. And it was so easy to tell 
how grateful he was, just in his answers to other, 
unrelated questions. 

What makes the band unique to him is “being 

able to communicate with everybody, it’s the love 
I have for each and every one of them honestly 
… it feels like one of those bands that never break 
up and you’re like, yeah, they all have their 65th 
Anniversary World Tour.”

After about 10 years together as a band, 

however, they still haven’t found a way to define 
their sound. There’s something funk, some soul, 
some rap, some spoken word. Some have tried 
to define it, using regional terms like gumbo, but 
the band has something else in mind. “To us, it’s 
almost like magic … it touches everybody, and it 
touches everybody differently,” Johnson said. His 
description of what it is like to play aligns perfectly 
with such a fantastical genre description, telling 
The Daily, “It’s almost like (the music is) part of us, 
but it’s not like I feel like one with it … it’s us, like the 
music is us and we are the music. We are the poetry 
and the poetry is within us. And you know, it’s like 
an energy, almost.”

This grateful energy ballooned throughout 

The Blind Pig that night, emphasized in the band’s 
finale, in which Ball riffed over the band for 15 
minutes, repeating the sentence “I am strong.” 
With her arms held high, eyes open wide, the 
whole band gazing into the crowd and observing 
and learning from their looks back, it was an 
image of triumph.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com 

In 1978, Gary Vaynerchuck migrated from 

Belarus to a studio apartment in Queens. 
Soon after, the 7-year-old “entrepreneur at 
heart” opened a lemonade stand before mov-
ing on to make thousands of dollars selling 
baseball cards. 

Now, Vaynerchuck is the chairman of 

VaynerX, a communications company that 
parents several media-based properties. Most 
notably, he’s a social media mogul in the start-
up space, where he’s known as “GaryVee”: you 
might’ve seen a video of Vaynerchuck on your 
LinkedIn feed dissecting the lucrative NFT 
market or a clip on Instagram of him divulg-
ing the secrets of starting a business. In fact, 
if you haven’t heard of him or his buzzword-
infested rhetoric, I envy you. Vaynerchuck 
hosts a Q&A show, a daily video diary, a pod-
cast and even owns a signature sneaker — and 
this doesn’t include the full schedule of events 
he books. For someone who rejects the label 
of motivational speaker — claiming he doesn’t 
want to be anyone’s Tony Robbins — Vayner-
chuck acts the part exceptionally well.

Vaynerchuck preaches the “hustle,” a 

broad philosophy on work that encourages a 
gutsy expression of free will, chronic produc-
tivity and a self-starting mindset. Hustle cul-

ture oversees the startup phenomenon that 
draws young, steadfast pre-entrepreneurs 
to the Silicon Valley area code, each with an 
idea that will make them the next Mark Zuck-
erberg. It rings of meritocracy with more fes-
tive catchphrases — “the grind doesn’t stop,” 
“work smarter not harder” and anything else 
you would expect to hear from a business 
major powered by Ritalin. 

However, it’s all pretty disingenuous 

because Vaynerchuck already succeeded — 
he gets to look back at his journey and tell 
people how it happened, and how they can 
do the same. In a piece he wrote for Medium, 
“The Day I Decided to Become GaryVee,” 
Vaynerchuck credits brute force for his suc-
cess. He writes, “So you know why I’m sitting 
here right now? At the top of one of the fast-
est growing creative agencies of all time … At 
a 150M dollar annual revenue business? At a 
company that has ambitions to become worth 
billions and billions of dollars? Not because I 
got lucky but because I outworked you. I went 
for it. Think about it. I outworked you.”

Okay, Gary. You did outwork me. Unfortu-

nately, I don’t plan my days down to the min-
ute, depriving myself of any and all moments 
of relief, no matter how infinitesimal. I don’t 
book meetings from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. just to 
wake up at 5 a.m. the next morning and do 
it all over again. If Vaynerchuck is setting a 
standard for a lifestyle that guarantees suc-

cess, it’s physically impossible to accomplish 
doing anything less than a 19-hour work day. 
In Vaynerchuck’s school of thought, that’s 
why I’m unsuccessful.

Vaynerchuck is an excellent orator, 

addressing his audience with the tone of a 
mean high school coach — a little hostile, yet 
claims what he’s saying is in everyone’s best 
interest. His sentences are short; they hit 
you like slam poetry. Each carries tangible 
passion, sprinkled with expletives and vocal 
inflections. In this way, Vaynerchuck is an 
evangelist, and productivity adopts a spiri-
tual quality. If you are listening to or watching 
Vaynerchuck, you must feel inadequate — he 
addresses the plebian, the chronic wannabe, 
and tells them that their problems don’t mat-
ter, that they should simply choose optimism. 
Socioeconomic status, gender, race, sexual 
orientation — these things aren’t barriers to 
success. 

The single mother who relies on child sup-

port to feed her children, the ambitious kid 
plagued by generations of poverty, the ex-con 
who is denied employment from McDon-
ald’s: These people just aren’t working hard 
enough. Because to Vaynerchuck, circum-
stances that are out of one’s control might not 
stop them from trying to do the impossible. 
To Vaynerchuck, you are the driving force, 
not the woes of capitalism or the social bina-
ries that alienate marginalized communities, 

or the company you inherited from your par-
ents in order to bypass the latter.

But Vaynerchuck is not a normal person 

— regular people don’t say things like “I’d 
rip both my legs off, and arms, to be 25 years 
old” or “I would suffocate and die if I worked 
9:00–5:00. I wouldn’t be happy. I want to 
work.” The average GaryVee listener might 
try to be just like him, because that’s what 
he’s telling them to do. What if the average 
GaryVee listener or average worker in general 
does not derive happiness from workaholism? 
Turning something you don’t enjoy into a life-
style, especially when that lifestyle requires 
an 80-hour work week, almost guarantees 
burnout. Go and live like Vaynerchuck for a 
week, and try to come back with a brain that 
hasn’t been reduced to gray sludge.

I can understand why hustle culture is so 

seductive — it evokes our survivalist nature: 
work harder than everyone else and you will 
reach the top. The strongest deserve to tri-
umph and the weak eat their dust. Hard work, 
excessive work, makes you a valuable member 
of society.

But American work culture is already 

riddled with toxicity — 83% of American 
workers report stress and burnout negatively 
impacting their personal relationships, and 
91% report a reduced work performance due 
to these same factors. Absolute commitment 
to productivity requires sacrifices in other 

aspects of life, including mental health. There 
is no getting around the fact that well-being 
and success at work are not mutually exclu-
sive.

With Vaynerchuck as the high priest of 

workplace productivity, what happens if 
everyone who listens to him actually puts his 
advice into practice? Will these people ever 
figure out that brute force alone can’t make 
you a millionaire? To me, the Gary Vayner-
chuck story creates a sort of paradox: He must 
attribute his success to something in order to 
market himself as a motivational speaker, but 
that something isn’t going to work for every-
one. It isn’t going to work for most people. 
Corporate America doesn’t want you in the 
club unless you’re already a part of it. The 
grindstone of capitalism is not meant to be an 
accessible venue; it’s evil and devoid of empa-
thy, it pulverizes the disenfranchised and 
garnishes the CEOs and GaryVees with more 
money. What we’re looking at, in the long 
term, is a generation of people who completely 
run out of gas before they turn 25, chasing the 
1% chance of breaking through. That’s why 
his popularity feels like a bad omen.

In a perfect world, America runs on the 

4 day week — we’d be more productive, less 
stressed, and wouldn’t have to take a cold 
shower at the crack of dawn just to wake our-
selves up. And we certainly wouldn’t have to 
listen to GaryVee to be successful.

You should stop listening to GaryVee

Content warning: Mental illness, 

suicide

Despite their rise in popularity over 

the last decade, movie musicals tend 
to be incredibly hit-or-miss. There’s 
a lot to be said about the clunkiness of 
the stage-to-screen adaptation, but at 
the core of this inelegance is the fact 
that Broadway musicals depend on 
something that no one will ever be 
able to translate fully to film: a certain 
suspension of disbelief. On Broadway, 
people can dress up like cats and sing 
about something called a “Jellicle Ball,” 
and the show will run for 18 years. 
When the same thing is attempted 
on screen, the film gains a reputation 
for being one of the worst movies ever 
made. It’s true that there is a lot wrong 
with the “Cats” movie, but the story’s 
absurdity was always there — what 
changed was a wider audience’s level of 
tolerance for it.

“Dear Evan Hansen” joins the ranks 

of other movie musicals with new film 
adaptations, and it suffers deeply from 
that change in tolerance. Ben Platt 
(“The Politician”) can play a 17-year-
old on a stage that distances him from 
his audience, but if you put him in front 
of a camera lens, every feature of his 
betrays the fact that he’s in his late 20s. 
On stage, he can sing poppy, hummable 
anthems that make it easy to forget the 
fact that his character acts abhorrently 
throughout the show, and then the show 
can garner near-universal acclaim and a 
reputation as a powerful force for suicide 
awareness and prevention. This is not 
the case for the film.

In “Dear Evan Hansen,” the titular 

character is a socially anxious, severely 
depressed high school senior who 
writes letters to himself as part of an 
exercise assigned by his therapist. On 
the first day of school, Connor Murphy 
(Colton Ryan, “Uncle Frank”), an angry 
social outcast, takes one of the letters 
after becoming enraged by its mention 
of his sister Zoe (Kaitlyn Dever, 
“Booksmart”), Evan’s longtime crush.

Soon after, Connor takes his own life 

off-screen, but Evan’s letter is found in 
his pocket, leading Connor’s mother 
Cynthia (Amy Adams, “The Woman 
in the Window”) to believe that the 
two were friends. 
Sympathetic 
to 

the family, Evan 
doesn’t 
correct 

them and instead 
doubles 
down, 

even going as far 
as to write multiple 
backdated 
emails 
between 

himself 
and 

Connor and rewriting his own history 
to 
accommodate 
their 
fabricated 

friendship. He entrenches himself 
within the grieving Murphy family 
— essentially replacing Connor as a 
son figure — begins dating Zoe, and 
becomes an internet sensation after his 
speech at Connor’s memorial service 
goes viral.

As a musical, the film asks us to accept 

a certain amount of implausibility as 
soon as Evan starts singing two minutes 
in, and this might be easier to do if the 
direction didn’t suffer at the hands of 
Stephen Chbosky (“Wonder”), a first-
time movie musical director. Even for a 

musical with straightforward settings 
and 
situations, 
Chbosky’s 
almost 

static, lingering camera eliminates the 
potential for any kind of dynamism 
during the musical numbers, flattening 
them. They’re almost boring, and some 
at the beginning even feel gratuitous.

The film is also filled with little 

oddities that are hard to comprehend 
as ever being believable. There is, of 
course, the fact that the attempt to 
age Platt down by 10 years somehow 
had the opposite effect. The internet 
exploded after the trailer’s release, 
with most of the commentary making 
the same observation: Ben Platt looks 
really, really old in this movie. There’s 
also a production design that makes us 
wonder if anyone involved has stepped 
foot inside of a high school since the 
early 2000s, and a sort of hilarious 
misunderstanding of how young people 
use technology (a lingering shot on 
video entitled “His Best Friend Died … 
You Won’t Believe What He Did Next!” 
actually provoked laughs in my theater).

Most importantly, though, the shift 

in the level of acceptability between 
stage and film changes the way that we 
interpret Evan and his actions. Criticism 
for the content of “Dear Evan Hansen” is 
not new; a 2017 piece from Medium even 
calls the musical “a toxic piece of theatre, 
a morally bankrupt exploitation of the 
experience of mental illness.” Evan is a 
character whose struggle with mental 
illness makes him easy to sympathize 
with, but is that enough to forgive all 
of the hurt he causes when his lies 
unravel? Does internal struggle justify 
objectively bad actions? Is “Words Fail,” 
an admittedly powerful eleven o’clock 
number, enough to absolve Evan of all of 
his sins?

The film desperately wants us to say 

“yes,” but my answer is “no.” One of the 
most salient criticisms of the musical is 
that it’s emotionally manipulative, and 
the film’s late addition of an essential 
revelation about Evan, intercut with the 
aforementioned eleven o’clock number, 
validates that criticism. We’re supposed 
to be hearing an unconditional apology 
from the character, but the movie 
inserts raw imagery of his earlier suicide 
attempt on top of it, asking the audience 
to forgive all of his indiscretions 
because of his trauma. This completely 
undercuts the number’s intentions, 
obscures 
the 
musical’s 
ultimate 

message 
and 

leaves behind a 
bitter aftertaste. In 
trying to redeem 
Evan, 
the 
film 

reveals its blatant 
manipulation. This 
decision 
resolves 

some 
of 
the 

frustrating moral 
ambiguity of the 

source material, but not for the better.

Critically and commercially, “Dear 

Evan Hansen” is one of the most 
successful Broadway musicals of the 
last decade, but its film adaptation is 
on its way to becoming one of the most 
poorly received movie musicals of all 
time. The ineffective translation to 
the screen has a lot to do with the way 
that many of the musical’s narrative 
decisions and themes just don’t work 
on film, revealing some of them as 
clumsy, some as mildly absurd and 
others as genuinely unacceptable.

The Good, The Bad and ‘The Many Saints of Newark’

It is hard to express the influence that HBO’s 

“The Sopranos” had on the history of television. 
The show dominated the television landscape 
during its eight-year run, continuing to rack up 
praise and viewers even as shows like “Lost” 
captivated the country. People continually refer 
to “The Sopranos” as a beacon of high-quality 
storytelling and entertainment, naming creator 
and writer David Chase (“The Rockford Files”) 
as a bona fide genius, cementing the legacy of 
well-made HBO shows that continues to this day.

Maybe this is why the return into the world 

of “The Sopranos” with the recently released 
prequel film “The Many Saints of Newark” feels 
so underwhelming. 

The film marketed itself hard as the origin story 

for James Gandolfini’s (“Enough Said”) iconic 
character Tony Soprano, but in reality, Chase 
and co-writer Lawrence Konner (“Boardwalk 
Empire”) focus on Richard “Dickie” Moltisanti 
(Alessandro Nivola, “American Hustle”), the 
father of a character from the original series. 
Tony does play a part in the movie, spending 
the first hour as a child (William Ludwig, “Side 
Hustle”) before the film hops forward five years 
when Tony is a teenager (Michael Gandolfini, 
“Cherry”). Other characters from the show are 
here as well, playing parts ranging in size from 
fun easter egg to vital story characters, but make 
no mistake: This is Dickie’s story. 

Set in 1967, Dickie Moltisanti welcomes back 

his father Aldo “Hollywood Dick” Moltisanti 
(Ray Liotta, “Goodfellas”) and his new wife 
Giuseppina (Michela De Rossi, “Boys Cry”) 
from their trip to Italy. With his father back in 
town, Dickie puts pressure on Harold McBrayer 
(Leslie Odom Jr., “One Night in Miami”), a mob 
enforcer, to get debts owed to the mob. Internal 
tensions both within the mob and the Black 
community come to a head during the Newark 
Riots, causing a deeper rift between Newark’s 
two prominent communities. Five years later, 
Harold becomes hellbent on starting up his own 
gang to rival the mob, setting his sights firmly on 
Dickie and causing a turf war that ends the only 
way the criminals know how: Death. 

The plot summary above may seem convoluted 

— and it is — but it leaves out a lot of details: The 
movie haphazardly tries to also weave in story 
beats for known characters like Junior (Corey 
Stoll, “Ant Man”), and shifts focus to Tony and 
his relationship with his mother. The script 
constantly jumps from character to character, a 
buckshot of narrative that sometimes connects 
together. The film seemingly wants the core 
relationship to be between an impressionable 
Tony Soprano and his Uncle Dickie who wants 
a better life for him, but it constantly loses track 
of whose story it is trying to tell, doing a major 
disservice to both characters. Are audiences 
supposed to empathize with Tony, with the 
possible knowledge of the man he will become, 
or with Dickie, who exists solely for these 120 
minutes and remains hard to emotionally 

understand? 

Director Alan Taylor (“Game of Thrones”), 

a frequent Chase collaborator on the TV show, 
does an admirable job bringing a cinematic 
quality to the work. Scenes are often visually 
pleasing and the camera work handles a lot of the 
emotional burden for the hard-to-read Dickie. 
Taylor puts the set and prop department to 
work establishing realistic-looking locations and 
objects, even going so far as to destroy it all for 
the Riot.

The actors are all top-notch as well. The 

actors of existing characters channel the 
original performances while adding their own 
flair — special mention must be paid to Michael 
Gandolfini’s performance of the character his 
father created. He inherits the character with 
grace and crafts a more naïve, innocent character 
than the one audiences are familiar with. 

Undoubtedly though, the most interesting 

characters are the ones created for the film. 
Nivola 
conveys 
Dickie’s 
main 
struggles 

admirably: Is Dickie a violent menace damned 
for his past deeds or can he redeem himself by 
doing good things for others? Unfortunately for 
Nivola, the script simply doesn’t allow enough 
time or space to get into the depths of Dickie’s 
mind. For a series that prides itself on in-depth 
examinations of its characters — the main 
premise is literally a mobster going to therapy — 
it’s a huge missed opportunity to never allow the 
audience to see how Dickie feels.

Love On Tour was something I honestly never 

thought was going to happen. After watching con-
cert after concert get postponed and eventually 
canceled, my hopes of actually attending tapered 
off. 

This fear of cancelation was a rain cloud looming 

over me up until the concert. The excitement I used 
to get leading up to those big nights was noticeably 
absent for my first concert in over two years. It didn’t 
really hit me until I’d found my seat and the lights 
went down that I was actually there. When you’re 
staring at Harry Styles live and in the flesh it’s hard 
to maintain incredulity.

Styles’s latest album, the pop-rock hit Fine Line, 

came out in December 2019 with Love On Tour 
marking the album’s stage show debut; contribut-
ing to the majority of the setlist, Styles performed 
11 songs off the album, alongside five from his pre-
vious self-titled album and one from his One Direc-
tion career. 

Styles played a variety of songs throughout his 

show ranging from bright rock to soulful ballads 
and managing to hit everything in between. At 
times the song transitions were jarring, lacking a 
cohesive musical style to tie them together; howev-
er, Styles opted not to sing large sets of songs back 
to back, which helped minimize this effect. On 
many of his songs, he sang harmony lines or tried 
out new vocal riffs, keeping the music relatively 
new and exciting even for those intimately familiar 
with his repertoire. 

Soaring, upbeat opener “Golden” set the tone for 

the whole show. Also the first track on Fine Line, it 
was a perfect beginning that sent the crowd into a 
frenzy that did not waver for the remainder of the 
night. Other musical highlights included guitarist 
Mitch Rowland ripping through the guitar solo in 
“She,” Styles’s extended improv in “Sunflower, Vol. 
6” as well as extended outros on popular singles 
“Adore You” and “Lights Up.”

The video board effects and lighting design 

were evocative of the psychedelic sounds flow-
ing within the music, creating a cohesive experi-
ence between the visual and auditory space in the 
venue. The music wholly encompassed the space, 
immersing the listener in an experience far greater 
than just listening to a song.

Although Little Caesars Arena is a larger venue, 

the concert had the intimate air of one much small-
er. This was due in part to the stage layout, which 
was centered on the floor with fans on all four sides 
rather than pushed off to one end, as well as Styles’s 
stage presence as he joked and interacted with the 
18,000 fans in attendance. 

Through all the music and the cheers, the defin-

ing moments of the night were the ones created 
between the audience and Styles, as his charisma 
and quick wit made jokes and rapport unique to the 
night’s attendees. Despite the melancholy nature of 
much of the material, he managed to keep an over-
whelmingly positive energy throughout the course 
of the show; Styles never stopped smiling, dancing 
and interacting with his fans.

Love On Tour in Detroit was a breath of fresh 

air, despite the masks required by the venue. Styles’s 
effort to keep the concert light and entertaining 
reflected well on his skills as a performer, and it will 
be exciting to see where they take him next.

When I was 16, I walked by my old 

friend’s house on New Year’s Eve. Other 
stops on my walk were the church I grew 
up in and the forest trail where I used 
to walk my dog. I was feeling particu-
larly wistful and a little depressed. I liked 
watching older movies like “10 Things I 
Hate About You” and “13 Going 
on 30” to feel better. Rom-coms 
filmed after about 2015 are cursed 
by streaming services’ high turn-
over rate. They don’t have the 
same heart as the older ones.

“When Harry Met Sally” 

is the quintessential romantic 
comedy. I’m pretty sure I heard 
the, “I’ll have what she’s having!” 
joke long before I understood its 
context. I never thought it would 
be a movie that would make 
me cry, but seeing Billy Crystal 
(“Monsters, Inc.”) run through 
the streets of Manhattan on 
New Year’s Eve to catch up to 
Meg Ryan (“You’ve Got Mail”) 
always gets me. They just don’t 
make rom-coms like they used to. 

I’ve talked about this before, but a really 

overlooked part of the rom-com is the nar-
rative downswing: the sad, tear-jerking 
parts when the protagonist fights with her 
best friend or loses her job. You can’t have 
comedy without tragedy. “When Harry 
Met Sally” is hysterically funny, no doubt 
about it. It’s hilarious (and evocative of the 
’80s career woman) that Sally’s sexual fan-
tasy doesn’t even involve sex. But that same 
vignette is also tender.

Sally doesn’t want sex; she wants 

someone to rip her clothes off. The man 
in her dreams is “faceless.” All she wants 
is someone to look at her, without the 
masks or the wallpaper. She just wants 
to be seen. There’s an unfinished vulner-
ability in her dream, as her friendship 
with Harry for most of the film. They 
talk about their lives for 18 hours when 
they first meet, then they don’t even see 
each other again for five years. How 
heartbreaking is it to know someone so 
deeply but not feel like you can call them 
your friend?

The happy ending is where the film 

reminds you that it’s a romantic comedy. 
Still, it’s not frivolous. It’s New Year’s Eve, 
and Harry made it to the party and told 
Sally he loved her, but she either doesn’t 
believe him or doesn’t care. They’re push-
ing through the crowd — one chasing, 
one retreating — and the countdown goes 
to zero. There’s cheering and kissing all 
around them, but they’re so angry with 
each other for their missed love. 

Eventually, Sally stops running. 

There’s confetti covering the shoul-
der pads all around them. Harry says, 
“It’s not because I’m lonely, and it’s not 
because it’s New Year’s Eve. I came here 
tonight because when you realize you 
want to spend the rest of your life with 
somebody, you want the rest of your life 
to start as soon as possible.”

He didn’t say that he wasn’t lonely, 

because he was. But he feels his love for 
her more than he feels his loneliness. 

There’s an Alexi Murdoch song called 

“Through the Dark,” where he writes, “I 
love you, girl, I love you more than I can 
say / Even with my heart in the way.” His 
broken heart won’t stop him from loving 
her. Love isn’t always as much of a feel-
ing as it is an act. It’s a late-night call, an 
argument about Casablanca, a cheek-to-
cheek dance, the feeling of a cable-knit 
sweater.

It’s “Auld Lang Syne.” Harry won-

ders aloud what that song even means: 
“Should old acquaintance be forgot?’ 
Does that mean that we should forget old 

acquaintances? Or does it mean that if 
we happened to forget them, we should 
remember them, which is not possible 
because we already forgot ’em?”

And Sally says, “Well, maybe it just 

means that we should remember that we 
forgot them, or something. Anyway, it’s 
about old friends.”

I think that’s what’s missing from 

the perishable, replicable, forgettable 
romantic comedies we see getting 

churned out now. Yes, “The Kissing 
Booth” and “Someone Great” do have an 
understanding of narrative arcs. There 
is some point when the protagonist gets 
down on their luck only to be lifted up 
again, but there’s no weight to any of it. It 
doesn’t seem to mean anything. 

This isn’t to say all rom-coms that 

came out after 2000 are hollow: “Palm 
Springs” and “Love, Rosie” are a couple 
of lighthearted-ish movies that actu-
ally stick with you past the time that 
you close your web browser. I think they 
achieve that by leaning into the weight 
in their characters’ lives. Not every rom-
com has to deal with the inevitability of 
death or the futility of life, but it has to 
mean something. If it doesn’t mean any-
thing, we have no reason to remember it.

And I guess that’s what I’m getting at 

with “When Harry Met Sally.” Love is 
about remembering who we’ve forgot-
ten. I don’t know if I nailed it by watch-
ing rom-coms or walking by an old 
friend’s house, but what matters, to me, 
is that I remember them.

Brian Teare’s walking meditations for 

the Zell Visiting Writers Series

I often wonder what people do on rainy days. Ones 

where the sky is so gray that you can hardly look ahead, 
where the damp pavement makes your bike wheels skid 
a bit as you try to swerve past people on the Diag, where 
your wet clothes stick to your skin like sweat on a sum-
mer day. Personally, I stay inside, unapologetically, wher-
ever inside may be. This time I escaped the rain in the 
Stern Auditorium at the University of Michigan Museum 
of Art, listening to the rhythmic words and syncopated 
breaths of poet Brian Teare, the most recent guest of the 
Zell Visiting Writers Series. 

It felt good to be back in the auditorium, “gathered in 

poetry,” as Teare says, listening from up close and not 
through my laptop’s microphone — which was refresh-
ing. So there I was: third row, ears, eyes and heart open to 
discovering the beauty of yet another wonderful author. 

At the event, Teare, who grew up in Tuscaloosa, 

Alabama, was presenting 
his sixth book, “Doomstead 
Days,” a collection of eight 
poems within 150 pages. 
From the Bay Area to Ver-
mont to Philadelphia, the 
poems illustrate a landscape 
of things he saw and felt, and 
that we, the listeners, could 
fully embody in our minds, 
thanks to his lyrical depic-
tions and vivid descriptions.

The first piece he read 

wasn’t a part of this book, 
instead, it was an essay called 
“Tell me about your weath-
er.” It had come about as a 
response to a friend’s inquiry 
to do just what the title indi-
cates. Set in Virginia in 2019, 
where he was teaching poetry at that time, this poem 
deals with climate as “a fiction, an abstraction.” 

He talks about the wind in a personified manner: “I feel 

its touch but can’t feel I’ve touched him back.” He looks 
around and realizes things aren’t permanent as they slip 
from his grasp and control — the clouds, the sun and the 
way climate change is making the bird population decline. 
It’s the ugly truth, exposed with pretty locutions. 

The second poem, titled “Olivine, Quartz, Granite, 

Carnelian” was long. Fast. Intense. It mimicked a walk-
ing meditation, and we were walking alongside him. A 
melodic internal monologue that activated all five senses, 
I could smell the pines, see the colors of the land ahead, 
hear the sounds of nature and “sing song sing song” of 
birds. I could feel the wetness of rain on my skin and 
taste the bitterness of belonging to a race that is “making 
all natural things human.” Teare exposed our environ-
mental guilt while simultaneously deadening it; a “sort of 
ruin that seems livable until it isn’t.” 

Teare slightly swayed from side to side as the words 

left his mouth, increasing in pace as the poem went on. 

Soon, we were met with a long grocery list of ways in 
which we are doomed. Among descriptions of fungi in 
bats, of microbes, nukes and tubes, Teare inserts scien-
tific facts of climate change and global warming. These 
were hidden among held-back sighs and measured notes, 
yet clear enough to leave the auditorium thinking of the 
rain outside differently. 

After he was done with reading, Teare sat down with 

English MFA Matt Del Busto for a Q&A. When asked for 
his formula for writing long poems, he said the secret 
was syllabics 
— composing by ear and always looking to 

“make facts sing.” 

Throughout his reading, I had noticed the musicality 

of his words, the rhythm in the way he structured lines 
and the dance that he ignited in my feet — moving in a 
similar manner to when I listen to jazz manouche. Teare 
had been a musician before he was a poet. But he was 
also a walker, making the length of poems coordinated 
with the time he spent on his stroll. The walk was “the 
skeletal map, a semantic map” that was finished sitting 
on his desk at home.

When the Q&A opened to the public, I asked a ques-

tion myself. I had been curious to know if, as a teacher, he 
ever felt that he had to write as a means of educating oth-
ers. To this, he answered that the poems were a means of 
educating himself first and that teaching the reader was 
the collateral result. “I go on walks just to go on walks,” 
he said.

I left yet another Zell Visiting Writers Series want-

ing to tell everyone I encountered about it. I went home 
and took my bike — it was still raining, but I didn’t care. I 
rode my bike and began noticing how the world around 
me reacted to rain. Those who run and those who hide, 
those whose ponchos cascade water in a halo around 
their shoes and those who use an umbrella too small to 
keep them dry. 

Teare left me with a sudden urge to write about every 

living thing around me. He made me realize that we are 
vulnerable at all times and are conditioned to catastroph-
ic change. So until the time comes, I will walk, observe, 
meditate and write. I’ll make a habit of it, especially when 
it rains.

Now and then, I stumble upon a new 

hobby. I have a track record of dropping 
commitments soon after I decide I want to 
pursue them, which usually makes me doubt 
the next will stick for long. Growing up, I was 
a ballerina, a tap dancer and a cheerleader. I 
quit all of them adamant that there were 
other things that needed my time. These 
“hobbies” are just distractions, I would tell 
myself. I was partially right, though. I never 
truly looked forward to doing these things 
and I never regretted quitting. This was all 
until I began writing and playing the ukulele. 
This time around, I think these hobbies will 
stick.

I started writing again a few years 

ago after I finally rebuilt my shattered 
confidence. All throughout my childhood, 
adults in my life told me to focus on 
something other than writing — something 
I was better at. I willingly listened and 
searched for a new passion, but in the 
process, I unwillingly let go of my youthful 
love for storytelling. In March 2020, I picked 
up the pen out of boredom and wrote out 
everything that had been pressing on my 
mind. I then began writing poems, personal 
stories, and whatever else came to my mind. 
Once I fell back into the practice, I couldn’t 
believe how I had ever stopped. Writing 
brought me peace of mind at a time in my 
life when I didn’t know that it was possible 
to find peace and it continues to provide this 
for me.

Over the summer, I wrote just for myself. 

One day, I felt satisfied with what I had 

written, and when I glanced at the time I 
realized there was still so much of the day 
left to fill. I grabbed my phone and did a quick 
Google search on the easiest instrument to 
learn. A list of instruments popped up and 
the first instrument listed was a ukulele. 
Without a second thought, I opened up 
Amazon on a new tab and looked up 
ukuleles. The screen was filled with varieties 
of the small, four-string instrument. Each 
one was covered in mahogany wood and 
had thin white strings that glowed against 
the wood. I endlessly scrolled, filled with 
excitement at the possibility of being able 
to play an instrument. Eventually one in 
particular caught my eye. The engraved 
body was meant to honor Hawaiian body 
ornamentation. Throughout the summer, I 
taught myself to play with the help of videos 
on the internet. Once I was confident in my 
ability to play, I started to sing along with 
the music I was making. Day would fade into 
night as I sat in my room learning strumming 
patterns and chords for new songs. 

I reflect back on what I’ve been doing over 

the past year and I wonder whether or not 
I’m wasting my time with these hobbies. I 
think to myself, you’re just writing incomplete 
thoughts in a Notes app and calling them 
poems. There’s no one explicitly telling me 
I’m wasting my time, but a voice in the back 
of my head tells me that I could be doing 
something more productive with my time. 
I could be volunteering, or working or doing 
homework, but instead, I let my entire day 
slip away as my pinky reaches for the first 
string of the ukulele to play an E chord.

32 Come clean, with 

injured ligament 

On Sept. 22, students and faculty eagerly 

gathered in the Rackham Graduate School 
Auditorium and tuned in from home to hear 
New York Times journalist Nikole Hannah-
Jones speak about The 1619 Project 
and its profound impact on our current 
educational, social and political landscape.

Arriving at the auditorium an hour before 

the event, attendees began lining up to 
attend her talk. As they waited for the event 
to start, they introduced themselves to each 
other and began initiating relationships, 
brought here by a mutual passion for 
initiatives like those of Hannah-Jones. The 
auditorium was abuzz, and the air was that 
of unrestrained excitement. This collective 
anticipation, palpable in the large gathering 
space, was warranted; getting to listen to 
Nikole Hannah-Jones speak was no small 
event, after all.

Hannah-Jones is a staff writer for The 

New York Times and has spent her storied 
career pursuing a firm commitment to 
discussing racial inequalities and injustice 
in America. More recently, she became a 
Pulitzer Prize winner for the body of work 
of which she would be discussing with 
us: The 1619 Project, a long-form project 
through The New York Times that was 
created with the intent to examine the 
pervasive legacy of slavery in America. 
While her plethora of accolades speak to 
her excellence — she bolsters a Peabody 
Award, MacArthur Genius Grant, two 
George Polk Awards, amongst other 
impressive accomplishments — she stands 
as a revolutionary journalist, activist and 
storyteller who has boldly redefined what it 
means to confront history in America. 

Upon her introduction, the crowd burst 

into thunderous applause, only to fall into a 
reverential, entranced silence as she began 
to speak. From the start of the presentation, 
Hannah-Jones 
was 
unflinching, 
an 

unapologetic force of nature as she provided 
her honest accounts of the backlash she 
received upon The 1619 Project’s release. 
In an eloquent and unwavering recap of 
the past year, she acknowledged former 
president Donald Trump’s efforts to create 
an entire commission against the project 
while prominent senators worked tirelessly 
to pass bills prohibiting its teaching 
in schools. She continued to detail the 
frenzied response that followed The 1619 
Project, explaining its rapid progression 
into an “intense disinformation campaign” 

executed 
through 
social 
media 
and 

mainstream conservative news platforms 
who actively worked to pervert the project 
into some heinous threat to the very 
integrity of our nation. Almost in tandem, 
a new phenomenon emerged in which the 
teaching of Critical Race Theory became 
synonymous with the goals of The 1619 
Project, stoking a “faux-hysteria” that 
resulted in concentrated legislative efforts 
to ban CRT from being taught in classrooms. 
The arguments and discontent stoked by 
The 1619 Project were relentless, spawning 
adamant accusations that the initiative 
was divisive, revisionist by nature or an 
attempt to exploit racial grievances and 
further exacerbate existing polarization in 
America.

In the face of such attacks, Nikole 

Hannah-Jones 
remained 
resolute, 

identifying the claims as exactly what 
they were: efforts to preserve the ideas of 
American exceptionalism that have been 
sustained within our education system 
for generations, favoring the teaching of a 
propagandistic history as opposed to one 
that forces individuals to confront the cruel 
realities of our nation’s genesis. With the 
motivation behind the mass hysteria and 
concentrated legislative efforts illuminated 
before us, the question then remains: 
“Why?” Why, in a nation that prides itself on 
free speech and the preservation of a rich 
marketplace of ideas, had a project with this 
very same intention become the target of 
such intense opposition and disallowance?

In order to contextualize the ardent 

disapproval of The 1619 Project, Nikole 
Hannah-Jones recounts the past year: 
notably, the murder of George Floyd and the 
widespread Black Lives Matter protests that 
arose as a response. The protests garnered 
an unprecedented level of engagement, 
with 69% of Americans claiming to have 
had a discussion about race between June 4, 
2020 and June 10, 2020. This mobilization 
marked a paramount moment in American 
history: non-Black Americans were not only 
beginning to acknowledge the prominence 
of police brutality in our nation, but 
recognizing the systemic implications that 
perpetuate it.

“You’re seeing a change in the national 

lexicon in how majorities of Americans are 
understanding the racial inequality that we 
see today, and connecting the inequalities 
that we see today to the legacy of slavery 
that dates back 400 years,” Hannah-Jones 
stated.

This new shift in the collective 

understanding of systemic racism gave 
rise to the possibility that our institutions 

would be forced to confront the ways that 
their power was founded on and amassed 
through the subjugation of Black and 
Brown individuals: to understand the 
events of 2020, the collective would have 
to understand the events of 1619. Hannah-
Jones cites this daunting combination as 
the catalyst for the public’s fear. It was not 
incidental that January 2021 marked the 
incessant vilification of The 1619 Project, 
and a bizarre obsession with Critical Race 
Theory that spurred substantive legislative 
efforts to limit its presence in public schools.

Upon 
acknowledging 
this 
pattern, 

Hannah-Jones poses a question to the 
audience: “Why is it that when you feel like 
your party is losing power, history is the 
thing you go to? When I start excavating 
the past … then it becomes something that is 
dangerous and has to be legislated against?”

The answer lies in the significance of 

history: how it is managed and manipulated 
to shape our collective understanding of 
the world, and how, when threatened, 
institutions seek to preserve the version of it 
that demands the least reconciliation.

Hannah-Jones’ description of history 

is two-pronged, illustrating our nation’s 
deliberate tendency to construct and 
maintain a favorable version of the past: 
“There’s history that’s what happened, on 
what date, and who did it, and then there’s 
history that is what we are taught about 
what happened, on what date, and who did 
it, and why, and what do we collectively … 
think our history is?”

With this understanding of history’s 

profundity and its immense power to 
guide collective memory, it becomes clear 
that The 1619 Project was never a direct 
threat to America’s integrity. What is truly 
threatened by initiatives like Hannah-Jones’ 
is the sanitized, delicately curated version of 
American history that has long been upheld 
by those in power. Unfortunately, the two 
have become intimately interwoven, as the 
preservation of our “American integrity” 
has become seemingly contingent on an 
active denial of our honest history. 

Any attempt to shed light on alternative 

narratives that have been selectively 
omitted from our collective memories 
thus threatens the institutions and power 
holders that have utilized their retellings 
of history to preserve their purported 
superiority. Those individuals will call 
these efforts blasphemous, “un-American,” 
anti-patriotic — they will call it anything, 
really, but the truth.

Why I Won’t Choose

One-time conversations

I’m sitting in a booth in the East Quad 

dining hall, hunched over a small bowl of 
beans and rice, when a voice coming from 
my right asks me a question. It takes me 
a few seconds to comprehend what this 
person is asking because of the music 
blasting through my headphones and the 
empty, almost meditative state that my 
mind takes when I’m eating. 

I pull an earbud out. “I’m sorry, what 

did you say?”

“Can I sit here?”
I nod and say yes to be polite, gesturing 

towards the empty seat in front of me. 
In reality, I am a little annoyed. For me, 
lunch in the dining hall is an opportunity 
to zone out completely and take a break 
in between a long day of classes. The 
last thing I want to do is have to talk to 
a stranger while doing so. Still, I try to 
be an agreeable person, so I offer up the 
cushioned seat of the booth across from 
me. There really isn’t anywhere else to sit 
during the peak lunch hour.

The boy introduces himself to me 

and I do the same. I don’t remember his 
name. We talk about something, mostly 
small talk with nothing of substance — 
hometowns, majors, classes — and then I 
finish my lunch and go about the rest of 
my day. 

I’ve always been a pretty quiet person. 

I don’t like drawing attention to myself, 
whether that be in class or in social 
settings. Not shy exactly, because I’ll 
speak up if I absolutely have to, but in new 
situations, I prefer to keep my speaking 
with strangers to a minimum. It was 
something that was easy to accomplish 
in my small high school, where I spoke 
to only a handful of people each day and 
during freshman year of college last 
year when most social contacts were 
nonexistent. This past month has been 
the first time I’ve talked to strangers I 
never intend to meet again. 

Last year, I tried to force myself to 

talk to many strangers. The intent of 
these freshman year interactions was to 
make friends. I talked to people with the 
desire to talk to them again later, and then 
again until we had exchanged enough 
words and spent enough time together 
to call each other friends. The results of 
this were often tiring (and sometimes 
disappointing). I remember listening to 
advice from upperclassmen who said that 
the people they talked to during the first 
few weeks of college were people that 
they never spoke to again. At the time, I 
knew these words were meant to calm 

the nerves of people who hadn’t made 
friends, but they also undermined the 
value of talking to people you will never 
see again — an amazing activity that I 
only started appreciating recently. 

One-time 
conversations 
tend 
to 

be memorable for me. Even if I don’t 
remember the names of the people that 
I’ve spoken to, I do remember their 
faces and random facts about them — 
a language class they’ve taken or the 
dorm they live in or where they’re from. 
Because I’ll never see them again, there 
is less pressure to remember their names 
and we can instead have a very brief 
moment of connection before continuing 
on our separate paths. After spending 
so much time cooped up at home, alone 
with no one but my family, these little 
conversations have become so much 
more meaningful to me. They’re also 
helping me acclimate to campus, adding 
stories to the hundreds of faces I see each 
day. Even though some might find these 
conversations dry because of how routine 
the conversations are — they rarely ever 
scratch the surface of who someone is as 
a person — I like seeing and hearing the 
different responses that others have to 
the same topics, like their favorite parts 
of the University of Michigan (Alice 
loves Nichols Arboretum Arb and Aisha 
likes to study in the Michigan League) 
or their favorite bubble tea spot in Ann 
Arbor (Will likes ChaTime but Katie 
thinks it’s overpriced). I might be a little 
tired of repeating those things myself, 
but it’s worth it to hear what the other 
person has to say. The knowledge that 
I’m probably never going to meet them 
again is nice, too. It takes the pressure 
off of the conversation and I feel more 
relaxed than I do when I talk to a stranger 
in class when I know I’ll see them the 
next day. Any slip-up or awkwardness in 
these moments will probably be quickly 
forgotten and if it isn’t, at least that person 
isn’t around every day to remind you of it.

My siblings and I have been 

best friends since I can remember. 
Attending the same schools together, 
traveling back and forth between 
our mom’s and dad’s and constantly 
fighting has strongly bonded us. 
Though the three of us were born 
within a three-year period, our 
experiences of identity realization 
have been vastly different. Up until 
2010, we all went to St. Patrick’s 
Catholic School in Joliet, Illinois. 
Despite being in an area with a large 
Latinx — specifically Mexican — 
population, my siblings and I were 
some of the only Latinx students 
in 
the 
entire 
school, 
with 
the 

administration and staff calling us 
the Infamous Quintana Trio. 

My memories of the predominantly 

white school are filled with images 
of my peers and me all dressed in 
white polos and navy blue pants, 
or checkered jumpers and skirts, 
running 
around 
the 
playground, 

attending 
weekly 
morning 
mass 

and hoping that the after-school 
program snack-of-the-day would be 
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. 
As a child, I didn’t feel or understand 
the social issues surrounding such 
a setting. I enjoyed my time at the 
school and the education they offered 
me — even if I do live with Catholic 
guilt now. Looking back at those 
years, though, I realize that not being 
otherized for my identity at such a 
young age is a great privilege that not 
many children of color experience. 

Since the school was on its way 

toward closure due to a lack of funds, 
every grade had only one designated 

classroom 
and 
teacher. 
From 

preschool to the third grade, the same 
twenty-something of us would travel 
down the hall to the next classroom 
from year to year. In the process of 
writing this article, I began to think 
of the many students in my class 
throughout the years and can vividly 
remember the few students of color. 
I never felt prejudiced or oppressed 
due to my skin color, and I know 
that many other students of color 
cannot relate to the lack of identity 
awareness I experienced.

After talking to my sister about 

St. Pat’s, however, I started to 
understand the privilege associated 
with not being forced to realize you’re 
different from the white people. 
The most important developmental 
period of her life was marked by 
bullying, racism and trauma — while 
for me, this same time was marked by 
joy and naivety. When I first asked 
her if she ever faced oppression 
because of being Mexican at school, 
her immediate response was, “I was 
called a gorilla because of my arms 
in kindergarten. So yes.” After this, I 
began reevaluating these interactions 
more generally. What experiences 
force people of color at a young age 
to understand their identities as 
different or other? Whenever I am 
asked about my time at St. Pat’s, I 
honestly only think of the good times. 
Whether it’s because I didn’t attend 
the school for as long as my sister 
did, or simply don’t remember any 
instances of racism, I wanted to know 
what made my awareness of identity 
surface so much later than hers.

Since its inauguration in 1999, Sept. 23 

concludes a week of pride and awareness 
for those of us who, you know, see on 
both sides as Frank Ocean put it in his 
groundbreaking track “Chanel.” But to be 
honest, this year’s Bisexual Visibility Day 
passed by quite ordinarily — in fact, I may 
have completely missed it. The month 
of June never really held any specific 
importance to me apart from exercising 
my eager allyship to the larger LGBTQ+ 
community because I didn’t quite know 
where I fit in. That and the rampant 
commercialization of Pride deepened my 
hesitation in participating in any form of 
liberating celebration. Nevertheless, this 
past Thursday felt eerily quiet. The first 
tri-colored post appeared on my Twitter 
feed as I was getting ready to go to bed, 
and I couldn’t help but feel a sense of loss 
in letting Bi Visibility Day slip away from 
me. 

Bi 
Visibility 
Day 
was 
founded 
by 
activists 

Wendy Curry, Michael Page and Gigi 
Raven Wilbur to address marginalization 
faced by the bisexual community and to 
celebrate bi experiences. In addition to 
providing an opportunity to uplift and 
recognize members of the bi community, 
this day of pride is particularly important 
because of bi-erasure, the questioning and 
invalidating of one’s bisexuality to the 
point of de-legitimizing their existence. 
This normalized tendency is perpetuated 
by people within and outside of the 
LGBTQ+ community, and its impact has 
led to detrimental effects for individuals 
who are bisexual. It is a key factor in the 
higher rates of anxiety and depression 
present in bi people as compared to 
gay and lesbian people due to isolation 
from the community at large. Moreover, 
bi-erasure threatens the livelihoods of 
bi people when they are excluded from 
policies that are meant to protect people 
on the basis of their sexual identity. In 
combating bi-erasure, bisexual political 
activism has come a long way in not only 
promoting the LGBTQ+ movement as 
a whole, but also making headway on 
legislative positions and focused support 
systems for the community. Working 
towards bi-visibility within mainstream 
society is an arduous journey, and at the 
individual level, it comes with its own 
unique set of baggage.

LGBTQ+ discourse in the mainstream 

forces the larger community into the 
narrative of a sexual binary: homosexual 
or heterosexual orientation. Bisexual 
identities, as well as trans identities, 

threaten what is accepted as legitimate 
or appropriate queerness. When seeking 
visibility, bisexual people are accused of 
taking up too much queer space. Visibility 
seems like an inappropriate demand 
from a group of people who generally 
have “straight-passing privilege.” But as 
Hannah McCann eloquently puts it in her 
piece for Archer Magazine, “Visibility 
is not about attention, it is about the 
possibility to exist, and to have one’s 
existence recognised.” It’s about not 
feeling the need to neglect, or even hide, a 
part of one’s identity. 

Visibility is complex for those who are 

bisexual, and oftentimes, it entails the 
pressure of constantly having to prove 
our identities to others and to ourselves. 
While some feel burdened with the 
societal expectation to come out, others 
prefer to never explicitly label themselves. 
Regardless of one’s preference to be 
out, visibility is about the possibility to 
exist, and that requires a recognition 
of bisexuality as a valid identity. When 
that recognition doesn’t exist, it’s easy to 
internalize the societal discomfort that 
usually accompanies any orientation that 
is not monosexual. And at that point, 
discomfort and all, I’m not quite sure 
what I’m supposed to be celebrating. 

Am I celebrating the confusion? 

The severe internalized biphobia? The 
isolation? Being bisexual is nuanced in 
every way, and everyone has a different 
journey of discovering — and celebrating 
— who they are. 

For me, Bi Pride is a chance to reflect 

on my own personal growth and draw 
inspiration from those who came before 
me. I wouldn’t be the person I say I am 
if I didn’t take the time to learn about 
individuals 
like 
Lani 
Ka’ahumanu. 

Ka’ahumanu is a feminist writer and 
activist whose work on the bisexual 
movement was published in a national 
lesbian and gay publication for the 
very first time in 1987. Her affirmative 
words encourage me to question why 
I accept invisibility in my own life. For 
Ka’ahumanu, coming out as bisexual 
simply means “I am drawn to particular 
people regardless of gender. It doesn’t 
make 
me 
wishy-washy, 
confused, 

untrustworthy, or more sexually liberated. 
It makes me a bisexual.” Similarly, I take 
pride in Freddie Mercury’s ambiguous 
sexuality despite facing heavy public 
scrutiny. 
His 
lifelong 
commitment 

to avoiding labels entirely and doing 
exactly what he wanted liberates my own 
confusion with self-definition. Diverse in 
their lived experiences, these trailblazers 
give me possibility — I see a tiny part of 
my identity within them, and I salute 
their authenticity.

In retrospect, maybe I do have 

something to celebrate, sitting tucked 
away in my little glass closet. And maybe 
you do, too. The beauty of bisexuality 
comes from its fluidity, and however you 
choose to live that truth is entirely up to 
you. So happy bi pride — whatever that 
may mean to you.

Happy bi pride!

(whatever that means to you)

Last year on the morning of my 19th 

birthday, I walked into a tattoo parlor in 
Ypsilanti with only one idea in my mind. 
I greeted my heavily pierced, tattoo-clad 
artist at his station with a small piece of 
paper containing my desired design. He 
looked up at me with a slightly amused 
smile, asking, “Just this?” The paper only 
read four simple letters: Ctrl. A simple 
design for a professional like himself yet 
such an emotionally packed word for me. 
I confirmed the design, and he began the 
process. While casually wiping off the 
mix of blood and ink that trickled down 
my wrist, he jokingly asked me what made 
Ctrl so extraordinary to the point that I 
wanted to have it permanently etched on 
my body. I laughed, before recounting to 
him the story of how I fell in love with this 
album.

When Ctrl was released in 2017, it wasn’t 

initially on my radar. I remember hearing 
“Love Galore,” the second single on the 
album, all over the radio that summer. 
The infectious digitally produced synths 
of the song’s instrumentals coupled with 
the carefree lyrics of the verses and the 
fun syncopation that rapper Travis Scott 
adds to the song quickly made it a favorite 
for me. Still, I never bothered to listen to 
the project in full until a friend of mine 
had posted a raving review of the album 
on her Instagram page. On my first listen 
through the album, I was immediately 
impressed by the production’s brilliance. 
SZA’s ethereal vocals float over the 
electronic R&B instrumentals as she 
builds this world in which she is the main 
character, taking back control of her life 
despite setbacks and inner turmoil.

She 
incorporates 
orchestral 

arrangements and 808 drum beats to 
weave through genres and create her 
own take on the neo-soul sound. The first 
time I listened, I couldn’t relate to much 
of the profoundly personal subject matter 
that SZA had relayed on the album. The 
topics of love, angst and sexuality were 
far too complicated for my 15-year-
old self. However, I knew that I could 
admire a good album when I heard one. 
As I grew older and developed more 
complex feelings about myself and my 
interpersonal relationships, I came to 
appreciate Ctrl even more. 

The album feels almost like a sonic 

diary. There is a deep level of vulnerability 
on each and every song, which I think 
distinguishes Ctrl, her debut studio 
album, from her prior mixtape, Z. SZA 
dives even deeper with Ctrl, uncovering 
the 
uncomfortable 
truths 
about 

womanhood and facing them with a 
tone of boldness. She even goes as far as 
to include recordings from phone calls 
with her mother and late grandmother, 
which serve as interludes throughout the 
album. I find solace in songs like “Normal 
Girl,” which addresses fleeting feelings 
of inadequacy and estrangement. On the 
track, SZA longs for the normalcy that 
comes with being a girl who cleanly fits 
into societal standards. On the chorus, she 
wishes that she were just a “normal girl,” 
while simultaneously acknowledging that 
she will probably 
never 
adhere 
to 
the 
conventional 

guidelines of desirability. This song hits 
very close to home for me because, as a 
Black woman, I understand her as she 
impeccably articulates the feelings of 
frustration and insecurity that can arise 
at the intersection of these identities.

My favorite verse from “Normal Girl” 

is, “This time next year I’ll be living so 
good, won’t remember no pain, I swear.” I 
often find myself in fistfights with feelings 
of imposter syndrome. Whether it be in 
academia, where a majority of my peers 
don’t come from the same background 
as me, or even in social settings, where I 
feel like I stick out like a sore thumb, I’m 
always trying to prove to myself that I am 
where I’m supposed to be. When I hear 
this line, it feels like words of reassurance 
to a future version of myself, a promise 
that these feelings of self-doubt will fade 
with time. While imposter syndrome will 
surely return to me at some point, this 
verse reminds me that no hardship will 
last forever. 

By the end of the brief session, I had 

talked my tattoo artist’s ear off with my 
full dissertation on the beauties of Ctrl. 
As I was leaving, he promised me that 
he would give it a listen. I look forward 
to following up with him when I go back 
to the parlor to get my tattoo touched up 
later this year. I hope he was able to hear 
at least a fraction of the artistry that I do 
whenever I listen to the album. Whether 
it’s sitting in my room, having a cathartic 
cry to “Supermodel” or driving in my car 
yelling the lyrics to “Drew Barrymore” 
with my closest friends, this album is a 
piece of art that carries me through the 
highs and lows in my life. I consider Ctrl 
an extension of my own thoughts — an 
album that puts the most inexplicable 
yet visceral emotions that I feel into 
words. The same melodies and lyrics 
that I’ve heard hundreds of times still 
resonate with me just as deeply every 
time. I’ve grown with this album and my 
experiences are permanently intertwined 
with its narrative. The tattoo that now 
lives on my wrist serves as a physical 
reminder of this.

If you’ve been planning a new 

project or pondering other 

career ventures, now is the time 
to actually explore those ideas 

and get to work. You 

may find romantic interest 
and/or creative inspiration 
in your classes or travels.

You may have been thinking 
about trying new courses or 

studying abroad. Now is the time 
to take action toward those plans. 
 

You may also let go of a creative 
idea that you’ve held onto, but 
you might find that your next 
piece of inspiration turns out 

more fruitful than 

the last.

great time to meet new people and 
form both romantic and professional 

relationships.

Venus enters Sagittarius and 

your third house of communication, 
indicating a great time to socialize. 
Use this opportunity to make friends 
and have fun engaging in interesting 

and intellectual conversations.

If you’ve been considering 

pursuing love or signing a contract, 
now is the time to commit. When 
Venus enters Sagittarius and your 
sixth house, you may feel the urge to 
be creative, but you have nowhere to 

channel your energy. You should 

try to implement a creative 
outlet into your schedule.

Although you are certainly not 
lacking any charisma, Saturn’s 

direct station in your seventh house 
of partnerships indicates difficulties 

in finding romantic and/or 

professional relationships. Perhaps 
you should put yourself in others’ 
shoes and assess the best way to 

appeal to them.

When Venus enters your fourth 
house of home and family, use 
this boost in creative energy to 

redecorate your space. This is also a 
good time to talk to your family and 

reconnect with childhood friends. 
You have the power to transform 

your ideas into great pieces of 
work; just set your inhibitions 

aside and start.

You’ve been ruminating on your 

thoughts for a long time, Scorpio. You 

are much more intelligent and articulate 

than you might let on since you are so 
guarded. When your ruling planet Pluto 

stations direct in your third house of 
communication and intelligence, you’ll 

finally get the chance to showcase 
your intelligence in conversations 

and projects.

When Pluto stations direct in your 
second house of possessions, your 
creative pursuits will finally begin 

to manifest. You love to explore 

different future prospects and meet 
new people, and now is a great time 

for that.

Immense creativity and an active 

imagination are some of your 

strongest assets, and Venus’s entrance 

into Sagittarius puts those skills to 
use. With Venus in your tenth house 
of career ambitions, you can bring 
all of your wildest dreams to your 

work. However, when Saturn stations 
direct in your twelfth house you may 

struggle to manifest your creative 

ideas.

You may find creative inspiration 
in technology, social media and/or 
social justice. Aquarians are known 
to have extremely original ideas, so 
use this opportunity to get inspired 

and create something great.

You may have been planning a new 
start, and now is your time to take 

action. You have total control over your 
appearance and your leadership, so be 
confident in yourself and your abilities. 
When Venus enters your twelfth house of 
imagination, your creativity will shine. 
Now is the time to explore any ideas for 

new creative projects.

F

our weeks into the new 
school 
year, 
the 
word 

burnout may seem like 

an inappropriate term to describe 
the typical University of Michigan 
student. The transition back to 
in-person school from online classes 
and extracurriculars, however, is 
challenging. In the past year, clubs 
and classes often were less structured 
and offered much more flexibility 
with asynchronous lectures, open-
note exams and forgiving attendance 
policies. 

“Last year while everything was 

online, I decided to join a couple 
more clubs and start working in 
a research lab,” LSA junior Alexa 
Samani said. “I felt that I had enough 
time to do everything I wanted to; 
however, now that mostly everything 
is in person, I feel very overwhelmed 
with the amount of time taken up by 
classes and extracurriculars.”

Asynchronous classes allowed 

some students to create their own 
schedules and, occasionally, take 
online exams open-note. While 
asynchronous options were often 
necessary to adapt to the changing 
needs of students and professors 
during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
these classes may have caused some 
students to go over a year without 
practicing their organizational or 
study skills. Similarly, some clubs 
and other extracurriculars were less 
demanding during the pandemic 
since they often consisted of entirely 
virtual participation. While the 
return of structure and normalcy 
is a relief to many students and 
faculty, the sudden change may put 
students at higher risk of burning 
out. Taking the steps to recognize the 

challenges of returning to campus 
and preventing burnout before it 
happens can help students transition 
with much less stress. 

Burnout can be defined as “a 

negative emotional, physical and 
mental 
reaction 
to 
prolonged 

study that results in exhaustion, 
frustration, lack of motivation and 
reduced ability in school.” Once 
you reach the point of burnout, it is 
difficult to jump back into a positive 
and productive mindset. While 
it may feel as though the normal, 
busy routine of college life shouldn’t 
necessarily cause burnout, students 
need to give themselves time to 
adjust or they will risk overextending 
themselves. 

It has been over a year since 

everything was in person — as 
we transition back, every facet 
of student life feels intensified. 
“Starting summer job and internship 
recruitment in person is much more 
stressful because you are constantly 
around other people talking about 
it and comparing experiences,” 
explained 
LSA 
junior 
Hannah 

Shipley.

Some students may be more 

prone to burnout than others due to 
other compounding factors, causing 
students that do struggle to question 
the validity of their experiences. 
“The monotony of having to be on 
Zoom and my laptop for over eight 
hours a day every weekday for the 
last few semesters made me feel 
mentally fatigued and burnt out 
much quicker than I had ever felt 
before,” LSA junior Ali Abdalla said. 
“Having in-person classes forces me 
to go outside and see the sun on my 
way to class and generally motivates 
me to study or do work outside 
of my house.” It is important that 
even students who do not expect 
burnout from in-person learning 

understand the stress others may be 
experiencing. The entire University 
of Michigan community should be 
empathetic toward those who are 
struggling and take steps to prevent 
burnout. 

On the surface level, there are 

basic steps students can take to 
prevent burnout. These include 
making time for enjoyable activities 
and socializing, exercising, getting 
outside, developing relationships with 
professors, avoiding procrastination, 
improving time management and 
maintaining a work-life balance. 

More specifically, however, it is 

essential that leaders of organizations 
reevaluate the structures and systems 
that existed prior to COVID-19 to 
allow students the time to readjust. 
Continuing to offer flexibility and 
empathy for members is essential 
because it can help students find their 
proper work-life balance and manage 
their time more effectively. 

Students must also advocate for 

themselves and their own needs. 
Communicating 
with 
professors 

and student organization leaders 
about struggles instead of ignoring 
them and pushing forward allows 
for a more productive environment. 
Club leaders and professors can 
then understand what their students 
are experiencing and help students 
succeed while having their personal 
needs met. 

Burnout has always been a 

challenge for college students, and it 
is likely every person will experience 
burnout at some point in their life, 
whether in school or their career. 
However, the sudden transition from 
online to in-person life elevates the 
risk of burning out considerably. It is 
essential that all members of the U-M 
community recognize the unique 
challenges of this semester and take 
the steps to prevent burnout now. 

W

alk around campus, 
and you’ll see people 
in varying stages of 

leaving the pandemic behind. Some 
might be roaming around without 
masks, basking in the sunshine. 
Most would be heading to an 
in-person class or to a library to 
study. After sundown, they might 
trade the library for a frat party. 
Then there are Saturdays, with 
clogged streets and a Big House 
full of more than 100,000 people 
cheering on our Wolverines. Even 
the buses are going back to their 
pre-pandemic routes.

Coming into this semester, I 

wanted this. I wanted a taste of the 
normal college experience, rather 
than 
the 
pandemic-affected, 

virtual one I ended up getting. We 
weren’t usual sophomores; most of 
us were as unaware as freshmen 
about Ann Arbor. The University 
of Michigan understood that this 
might be a common sentiment 
among the class of 2024 and 
included us in many Welcome 
Week events.

It was almost intimidating to 

be around people at first. The 
pandemic had left us socially 
rusty. But apart from some initial 
awkwardness, 
we 
all 
slowly 

got used to the small social 
interactions that are part of the 
classroom experience.

Just as I started settling in, 

a 
second 
pandemic-induced 

behavior crept up: hyperalertness 
towards coughing and similar 

COVID-19 symptoms. The echoing 
sound of so many people coughing 
brought some uneasiness, but I 
brushed it aside. After all, weren’t 
we all vaccinated and masked up? 
It’s probably not COVID-19, I told 
myself.

Then people in my hall started 

getting sent to quarantine. There 
was a spike of COVID-19 cases, 
with the first two weeks of classes 
seeing 
over 
460 
documented 

positive cases. It became a part 
of my waking up routine to read a 
few COVID-19 notification emails, 
either of a COVID-19 case in my 
dorm or in one of my classes. The 
emails didn’t have much useful 
information (with no mention of 
which class, making it very vague 
if you had multiple large lectures 
on the same day), but they got 
COVID-19 back on my mind.

I started thinking about what 

I’d do if I contracted the virus. 
While vaccines certainly do a great 
job at preventing severe disease, a 
positive test result would still end 
up sidelining anyone for 10-14 days. 
I went on Canvas and checked if all 
my classes uploaded recordings. 
I was very disappointed to find 
out that almost half of mine did 
not. Additionally, some of the 
recordings that were uploaded 
had issues like the microphone not 
being turned on.

What makes this worse is that 

a lot of professors enforce lecture 
attendance. How are students who 
are quarantining supposed to stay 
in compliance? Or even stay on top 
of coursework?

Before 
the 
pandemic, 
this 

would 
be 
inconvenient 
but 

excusable. Many professors may 
lack the know-how to record their 
classes, or classrooms might not be 
equipped to do so. However, after 
two and a half remote semesters, 
this excuse doesn’t hold water. 
We’ve handled classes over Zoom 
where professors had to handle 
massive online meetings. Many 
buildings have also had equipment 
upgrades 
to 
support 
Lecture 

Capture (the lecture recording 
program connected to Canvas 
which can also simultaneously 
record the class slides) covering 
most classrooms used by LSA and 
College of Engineering courses. 
Set-up is also relatively easy 
compared to managing vast online 
meetings, with professors needing 
to request time slots for recordings 
and wearing the recorder when 
the time comes. For lecturers and 
professors who aren’t comfortable, 
training is also provided.

One might argue that putting 

in the effort to make recording 
classes more widespread might 
not be so urgent now. COVID-19 
case numbers have fallen after 
the initial spike, but I would 
counter that this is something that 
will help students long after the 
pandemic is over. Students will no 
longer feel forced to go to classes 
when feeling ill to avoid missing 
out on content.

It boils down to a choice. Do we 

try to go back to exactly how things 
were before the pandemic and 
forget everything? Or do we try to 
keep the good things we learned? 
As the semester progresses, I hope 
the University opts to go more 
often with the latter.

I

’ve never considered myself to 
be well-versed in the language 
of travel. I can remember the 

finer details, but they only leave a faint 
impression. For me, the experience is 
defined by my emotions, not the other 
way around. However, looking back 
on my childhood, I treated vacations 
as a semi-conscious experience, 
enjoyed in the moment and then 
mostly forgotten, with nothing but 
the feeling to be savored. The goal 
was to numb my mind as a means 
of escapism. And in 2014, my family 
desperately needed an escape. 

Near the end of May, my mom 

was diagnosed with stage two breast 
cancer. She wouldn’t have her first 
surgery until July and until then we 
wouldn’t know whether or not she 
needed chemotherapy (we would 
later find out she didn’t). Suddenly 
normality had an end date. In the 
meantime, we continued on with a 
sense of caution, trying not to dwell 
on the worst possible outcome. 

Myrtle Beach, S.C., was poised as 

our temporary escape. We had spent 
many weeks in the summer by the 
different lakes of Northern Michigan, 
but never had we stayed by the ocean. 
My sister and I were excited; our dad 
was afraid. We weren’t very good 
swimmers and shark sightings were 
common. But we were going with 
family friends who’d frequented the 
area. We would be safe and, most 
importantly, have time as a normal 
family before the inevitable. 

Not everything could be frozen 

in time. I was having my own 
development; I was beginning to 
grow into a woman. I had been 
getting periods for a few months 
now, I got my first bottle of tinted 
moisturizer, I graduated to bras from 
PINK. I was growing aware of my 

own sexuality, but I was still a child 
and I wanted to stay that way. It was 
a delusion, thinking I could maintain 
control. 

Myrtle Beach had a pulse unlike 

anywhere I’d ever been. Vacations for 
us were usually spent in the isolation 
of a cottage or private resort. I’d never 
seen such a wide range of experiences 
all occurring within a few feet of 
each other: strolling families with 
tiny children, college-aged friends 
stumbling drunk, adults struggling 
with addiction and homelessness. Of 
them all, I was most oblivious to the 
attitudes of young adults, mostly the 
men, but I could feel their electric 
energy as they cruised down the road 
next to the hotel. It both scared and 
excited me. 

The hotel itself was bare, but we 

didn’t mind. We spent most of our time 
by the ocean and hotel pools. The beach 
itself was expectedly remarkable. The 
saltwater stung my eyes, but I kept 
going back in until I could barely see 
and my skin burned. We drank non-
alcoholic piña coladas and pretended 
they were real. Mom and Dad floated 
with us down a circular lazy river, again 
and again for hours. 

Across 
the 
road, 
a 
green-

painted cafe with soft booths and 
air conditioning balanced out the 
excitement of the beach. Smiles and 
soft South Carolina drawls greeted 
us when we entered. We made 
conversation with the waiters and 
other customers, where we were 
from, where we were going and what 
grits are exactly. 

It was sweet. It was almost real, my 

mind subdued at last. It was the road 
around the hotel that awoke me from 
my dreamlike haze.

Night or broad daylight, it made no 

difference. We’d be walking between 
our hotel and our friends’, tankinis 
on and towels draped around our 
shoulders. 

Cars honking as they whizz by. 

Who are they honking at? 
Male passengers lean out of the car. 
Are they looking at us? 
“Hey sexy!” 
Who are they yelling at? 
“Dance for us!” 
Oh. 
“Don’t wear your bathing suits 

near here anymore,” warned our 
parents as they herded us inside. 
It happened anyway, every day, 
multiple times a day. 

I had never been sexually harassed 

before. I didn’t even know what those 
words meant. But I felt them and I was 
embarrassed and confused. Is it wrong 
to be wearing this swimsuit in public? 
Didn’t they notice that our parents 
were right next to us? Didn’t they 
know we were children, just 12 and 
14 years old? I had so many questions, 
some of which still I don’t know the 
answers to and probably never will. 

Beneath my discomfort, a sense of 

pride blossomed. I knew their words 
were not motivated by kindness, 
yet I felt almost complimented. 
I wondered if those reactions 
meant I was pretty. Insecurity 
inspired my thoughts; as a child just 
starting puberty, I relied on others 
for confidence. But as I gained 
awareness of myself and the realities 
facing me, the pride slowly melted 
away, leaving nothing but shame. 

Though lacking the vocabulary 

to describe it accurately, during that 
trip I realized the pervasiveness of 
anonymity in public spaces; the sound 
moves quickly and the source escapes 
into the crowd of people or into the air 
with a speeding bike or car. You may 
never see their face, but you’ve been 
violated. 

It would be nonsensical to blame 

Myrtle Beach as an entity or even 
as an idea. Its quick and loose 
atmosphere doesn’t cause catcalling, 
rather people abuse those qualities.

H 
 

ey you! Do you want 
to explore the world? 
Do you want to do 

interesting things with interesting 
people? Do you want to get paid to 
do it? I’d like to tell you how you can, 
all while helping out your fellow 
Americans. Our country faces many 
problems, but today, I would like 
to focus on just three of them. The 
first is polarization. We are more 
divided than we have been in recent 
memory, 
and 
this 
polarization 

seems to spread to a new sector of 
our society every day. The second is 
physical infrastructure. Our roads 
are covered with potholes, many of 
our public housing developments are 
in states of disrepair and the majesty 
of our national parks is obscured by 
decaying infrastructure. Finally, our 
young people are more aimless than 
they have been in recent history. 
There is a solution to all of these 
things, and it is a robust national 
service program. It is time that we, as 
a country, invest in one year of service 
for 18-year-olds to do work that needs 
to be done, cut down polarization and 
help millions of young people find 
their ways in life. 

What do I mean by a national 

service? I mean enlisting every 
18-year-old and sending them off 
to work in a different part of the 
country for a year. Filling potholes 
in Kentucky, giving vaccines in New 
York or killing invasive snakes in 
Florida. These are just a few of the 
things they will be doing, each new 
public servant will be given a stipend 
of around $500 a month, as well as 
food and housing to go along with it. I, 
along with many before me, propose 
that every person who graduates 
high school should be expected to 
serve, barring any major exceptions 
such as health problems or childcare 
responsibilities. 

Our country is more divided now 

than it has been in recent history. 
A smaller and smaller number of 

Americans can say they have people 
close to them with differing political 
views. Exposing young Americans 
to people with different views will 
do good for developing a more 
tolerant, less polarized society. We 
saw a similar effect occur when the 
military was desegregated in 1948. 
Units that were desegregated showed 
more tolerant behavior towards those 
different from themselves, and unit 
performance improved. For many 
historical reasons, we are a politically 
polarized 
country. 
Democrats 

and Republicans shop at different 
stores and work different jobs. We 
need a program to funnel young 
people together, even if only for 12 
months, so that the next generation 
of Americans with different social 
identities can recognize each other’s 
shared humanity.

We live in a time with sky-high 

rates of teen depression. Many 
young people are aimless, often self-
medicating the empty feeling they 
experience with drugs and alcohol. 
A national service would allow young 
people to connect with their labor 
in a way not possible throughout 
schooling. It allows them to socialize 
with other young people while 
also affirming their commitment 
to making a better world for 
their 
neighbors. 
Research 
has 

demonstrated that service for others 
is rewarding both because of the 
immediate feel-good effects of doing 
something good, but also because 
of the beneficial social relationships 
that people gain through it.

Ignoring the benefits to the 

conscripts, our country still has a lot 
of work to do. Take infrastructure 
for example. The American Society 
of Civil Engineers reports that 43% 
of our nation’s roads are in either 
poor or mediocre condition. Our 
national parks are also in states of 
disrepair, with billions of dollars 
of repairs needed to get them up 
to snuff. Rivers are polluted, the 
unhoused are suffering and forest 
fires are rampant. There is so much 
good that approximately 3.5 million 
civil service foot soldiers could do 

for a nation with problems like ours. 
A model for this sort of program can 
be found in the Civilian Conservation 
Corps of the 1930s. The CCC did 
some of the most important work of 
the 20th century, and it is our duty to 
make sure that their work does not go 
to waste by allowing our country to 
wallow in disrepair.

Some critics cite this kind of 

program’s financial cost. But the cost 
of this program, even if it reaches 
the $75 billion mark, will be worth 
it several times over. It doesn’t just 
benefit the participants; it also 
enhances the ability of the federal 
government to get things done. 
We absolutely can expect that the 
government will be able to utilize 
these millions of young people doing 
their national service to all areas of 
the government. For example, the 
price of running the CDC will go 
down because the custodian will be 
someone doing their national service, 
or the price of getting seniors their 
social security payments will fall 
because the front desk assistant at the 
social security office will be someone 
serving their country. This hopefully 
wouldn’t displace current, often 
unionized, government workers, but 
instead, would add on to the capacity 
of the government to do good.

I support a national service 

because 
we 
have 
millions 
of 

unfulfilled young people and millions 
of potholes to fill, trees to plant and 
homeless shelters to build. The cost is 
negligible compared to the desperate 
need. Many other developed nations 
have an expectation of service, like 
South Korea and Sweden, but unlike 
them, we wouldn’t require service in 
the armed forces. I know that I would 
have loved a government-mandated 
gap year between high school and 
college, and I imagine many of my 
peers would have as well. Even the 
most put-together young people 
need time to breathe, decompress 
and evaluate. And what better way 
to do it than building paths on a 
beautiful Montana mountainside 
with Americans of all colors, creeds 
and abilities.

It’s time for a national service

Fliegner highlights 

Michigan performance 

in Wolverine 
Invitational

Increased speed evident in Michigan’s first game

For years, Eddie Elinburg was the 

go-to guy. 

“If you called me at three in the 

morning, I’d be there to change your 
tire,” Elinburg said. “People counted 
on me.”

But since losing both of his legs 

in a hit-and-run vehicle accident in 
2011, things have been different for 
Elinburg. 

“Now, I have to go to others for 

help,” Elinburg said. “I just wasn’t 
used to that. There were some pretty 
hard times.”

Through 
sports, 
however, 

Elinburg was able to begin restoring 
balance to his life. Individual sports 
like pool, darts and horseshoes came 
first. Once he had mastered those, 
Elinburg began to seek out other 
adaptive sports, hoping to challenge 
himself and boost his fitness. 

Unfortunately, these opportunities 

were few and far between. Despite 
his motivation, Elinburg struggled 
to find any adaptive sports programs 
in Canton, Mich., where he lives. At 
one point, Elinburg frequently took 
days off work and to make the hour-
long trip to Lansing, just to take part 
in a few hours of adaptive sports 
programming at Michigan State. 

This summer, Michigan’s Adaptive 

Sports and Fitness (ASAF) program 
began hosting biweekly wheelchair 
basketball and tennis drop-in sessions 
open to Michigan staff, faculty, and 
students, as well as all members 
of the community. Through this 
programming, a full 10 years after 
his injury, Elinburg finally gained the 
reliable, local access to competitive 
adaptive sports programming he had 

so desired. 

“When (they) reached out, my 

head lit up like a Christmas tree,” 
Elinburg said. “I don’t know who sent 
the email, but I want to thank them 
for that, because that’s what’s keeping 
me happy.”

Elinburg 
attended 
wheelchair 

basketball 
practices 

consistently throughout the 
summer, improving markedly 
as a player with the help of 
veteran player-coaches Alex 
Saleh and Spencer Heslop. In 
fact, despite only having begun 
playing wheelchair basketball 
recently, Elinburg will suit up 
for Michigan this fall as part of 
the program’s first ever NWBA 
team. 

While Elinburg’s story is 

rounded out by a happy ending, 
his struggle to find adaptive 
sports and fitness opportunities 
is 
unfortunately 
common 

among 
individuals 
with 

disabilities. 

“I was injured just over five 

years ago and I’ve been trying 
to scope out adaptive sports 
programs ever since,” said 
Laura Stark, a fellow Canton 
resident and Elinburg’s soon-
to-be NWBA teammate. “I feel 
like they’re there, but they’re 
not advertised well.”

Stark, like Elinburg, was a 

frequent drop-in attendee this 
summer and has taken quickly to 
wheelchair basketball. While she’s 
always been active, she longed for the 
opportunity to play as part of a team.

“Wheelchair 
basketball 
is 
a 

community,” Stark said. “A lot of other 
adaptive sports I’ve played in the past 
are single player, where it’s only up 
to you. But when I play team sports, 

that’s where I feel the most value 
comes.”

For Michigan ASAF Assistant 

Director Erik Robeznieks, experiences 
like Elinburg’s and Stark’s are precisely 
why 
hosting 
consistent 
drop-in 

programming has been such an 
important goal for the program. 

“By hosting these sessions, we’re 

trying to leverage our status as part 
of a great sporting and academic 
institution like the University of 
Michigan to address the gap that 
exists in the community for people 
with physical disabilities to engage 
in recreation, leisure and competitive 
adaptive sport,” Robeznieks said. 

While providing a space for 

individuals to participate in adaptive 
sport is an important step toward 
Robeznieks’s goal, it’s not enough 
on its own to ensure that individuals 
who want to play can do so. 

For example, sport wheelchairs 

are 
shockingly 
expensive. 
This 

cost, combined with the fact that 
individuals with disabilities are 
employed at approximately one-tenth 
the rate of those without, creates an 
insurmountable financial barrier for 
many. 

To address this, with donor 

support, the ASAF program offers 
their programming completely free 

of charge while also providing sport 
wheelchairs and other equipment to 
all who need it. 

“Even if it was free to play but you 

had to bring your own equipment, 
I think the numbers would drop 
significantly,” Stark said. “I couldn’t 
play. I don’t own a sports chair. Even 

for those in the disability 
community who do have jobs, 
you have to spend so much of 
your money on medical care 
and things like that — it makes a 
world of difference to be able to 
play for free.”

Echoed Elinburg: “Right 

now, if this wasn’t free, the 
activity I’d be doing is probably 
nothing.”

The obstacles to providing 

equitable access to sports and 
fitness don’t stop with finances. 
Many without disabilities simply 
lack an understanding of why 
providing adaptive sports is such 
a vital part of any community, 
leading to a lack of motivation 
among 
organizations 
and 

institutions to really do anything 
about the problem. To that end, 
the program stresses that the 
programming is open to all, 
regardless of disability status. 

“Through drop-ins, we can 

bring adaptive sports to life 
in a sense,” Robeznieks said. 
“We can actually get people 
involved and allow them to 

form a personal connection with 
adaptive sports. That will allow them 
to … change whatever preexisting bias 
they may have, and it will allow them 
to appreciate adaptive sports for the 
sake of its skill and the athletic ability 
that is required to participate.”

Added Stark: “Bringing in people 

outside of the disability community 

is great because it shows that the 
sport is just as difficult this way as it 
is when played by able-bodied people. 
I hope that people will start to see 
that a wheelchair isn’t just a piece of 
medical equipment — anyone who 
wants to play wheelchair basketball 
needs a wheelchair. I think that will 
do a lot for awareness.”

While Robeznieks stresses that 

the most important goal of the 
drop-in programming is to provide 
equitable access to sports and fitness, 
he also hopes that by opening the 
program’s doors to all members of 
the community, they can accelerate 
the development of an elite-level 
wheelchair basketball team. 

“We’re only going to be able to 

form 
competitive 
intercollegiate 

teams if we’re able to recruit athletes,” 
Robeznieks said. “But a common 
problem that we’ve had in trying to 
recruit athletes is them telling us to 
come back when we have a team.”

By participating in the NWBA’s 

adult division, the program will be 
able to field a team of both Michigan 
students 
and 
local 
community 

members. This way, the program 
can market itself to prospective 
athletes as having an established 
squad. Eventually, after the program 
can field a team in the intercollegiate 
division, this more recreational adult-
division level team can continue 
to serve as a competitive outlet for 
community members like Elinburg 
and Stark. 

After 
the 
success 
of 
drop-

in 
programming 
this 
summer, 

Michigan ASAF plans to continue 
offering 
wheelchair 
basketball, 

wheelchair tennis and adaptive track 
and field sessions indefinitely — still 
free and still open to all, with or 
without disabilities.

After 
two 
shortened 

seasons, 
the 
Michigan 

women’s tennis team was 
finally able to make their 
long awaited return to a full 
slate of matches this fall with 
the Wolverine Invitational as 
their third event of the year.

The Wolverines hosted 

Michigan State, Ohio State, 
Notre Dame, Arizona State 
and Western Michigan at 
the three-day meet this past 
weekend. The Wolverines 
had a positive overall record 

for the event with a total of 
17 wins and nine losses. The 
event didn’t count for team 
points but remains important 
to see how each of the players 
stand before the ITA All-
American 
Championships 

next week. Potential doubles 
teams had an opportunity 
to build chemistry in a 
competitive 
environment 

and the players received one 
of their first big tests.

The team started with a 

strong first day, going 5-1 in 
doubles and 4-1 in singles. 

“We brought competitive 

teams in here and I feel like 
we got a high level of play,” 
Michigan 
coach 
Ronni 

Bernstein 
said. 
“They’ve 

been practicing hard, and it 
showed that first day”.

Michigan’s 
biggest 

bright spot was undefeated 
freshman Julia Fliegner who 
finished the weekend with a 
4-0 singles and 3-0 doubles 
record.

“She had an unbelievable 

weekend,” Bernstein said. 
“It was a great match 

against Notre Dame against 
a girl who’s going to play 
high for them. We didn’t 
see her much last year 
because of COVID, but she 
was very impressive. Really 
everybody was, I was proud 
of the whole group and how 
they competed.”

Fliegner would finish 7-0, 

but her final match was the 
most difficult of the weekend. 
Notre Dame’s Page Freeman 
jumped out to a two game 
lead to start the match, 
including a break in the first 
game. Fliegner broke back to 
make it 3-3, but later had her 
back against the wall with 

Freeman 
serving 

with a 5-4 lead. 
After 
a 
crucial 

break 
and 
hold 

from 
Fliegner, 

Freeman 
was 

down 6-5 and had 
to win her serve 
to force a seven 
point set tiebreak. 
However, at 30-40, 
she double-faulted 
to lose the set 7-5. 
The second set was 
also back and forth, 
but Fliegner never 
gave up the lead 
and cleaned up the 

match to win, 7-5, 6-3.

The 
invitational 
was 

capped off with a gritty three 
set win from junior Nicole 
Hammond against Arizona 
State’s Cali Jankowski. After 
a 6-1 first set loss, Hammond 
commanded the rest of the 
match and never again gave 
up the lead in either of the 
final two sets. The 1-6, 6-2, 
6-3, Wolverine win ended 
the event with a statement 
comeback.

Although the Wolverine 

Invitational 
was 
non-

scoring, Michigan now has 
momentum that it will look 
to carry forward into the 
rest of the season. Five of 
the Wolverine’s top players 
will travel to South Carolina 
next week and compete in 
the Michigan’s first scoring 
event of the season.

“I’m going to use this 

event as a confidence point,” 
Fliegner said. “When I’m in 
tough points in next week’s 
tournament I’m definitely 
going to think back to here 
and how I played.”

Legendary hockey coach Herb 

Brooks used to yell “legs feed the wolf” 
at his 1980 Olympic team.

In 2020, the Michigan hockey 

team’s roster featured skill on both 
ends of the ice. But still, its legs couldn’t 
deliver a feast every night against faster 
opponents like Minnesota 
and Wisconsin.

If last Saturday’s 7-1 

exhibition 
win 
over 

Bowling Green is any 
indication, though, the 
Wolverines could be a few 
strides ahead this season.

From the early minutes 

of 
the 
game, 
speed 

dominated 
Michigan’s 

game 
plan. 
When 

sophomore 
forward 

Matty 
Beniers 
found 

sophomore forward Kent 
Johnson alone at center 
ice, Johnson used his legs 
to widen the gap between 
himself and the Falcons 
defenders. 
That 
gave 

him plenty of time to fool 
Bowling Green goaltender 
Zach Rose as a quick flick 
of his stick deposited the 
first goal of the season.

The 
same 
legwork 

that led to the goal also 
extended many of the 
Wolverines’ scoring threats. As hard 
shots ricocheted off Rose, the puck 
skittered toward the boards where the 
Falcons’ defensemen had a chance to 
dump it out. Michigan’s speed often 
won out in the ensuing footraces 
and, combined with their physical 
presence, it generated plenty of shots. 

“Every team is going to be pre-

scouting our skill,” sophomore forward 
Brendan Brisson said on Friday after 
the game. “But it’s about playing hard 
in the hard areas, getting pucks deep 
when we have to and getting pucks 
back quicker so we can use our skill in 
the right moments.”

On 
Saturday, 
the 
Wolverines 

executed 
those 
offensive 
moves 

faster than they did last season. In a 

split second during the first period, 
Michigan set up a 1-3-1 power play. 
Bowling Green couldn’t account for 
the ensuing flurry of quick passes, and 
Brisson skated away with a goal.

The Wolverines’ transition game 

relied on its speed advantage. Quick 
strides down the wings opened up 

clean odd-man rushes and lagging 
defenders couldn’t break up the zone 
entries that led to long offensive 
setups. Michigan controlled the pace 
of play all game by using that speed, 
unlike last season.

Freshman 
defenseman 
Luke 

Hughes played a prominent role 
in that, lurking closer to the top of 
the faceoff circle even when the 
Falcons threatened a breakout. Many 

defensemen playing that far up would 
get burned. But Hughes’s confidence 
in his skating ability proved effective 
as he chased down anyone that 
slipped by him with ease. That kind of 
confidence — a trait Michigan coach 
Mel Pearson said reminded him of 
his brother Quinn Hughes — allows 

Hughes to make the most of his ice 
time.

The same rang true for senior 

forward Jimmy Lambert, whose 
speed looked deadly in the bottom six. 
Lambert, Hughes and junior forward 
Eric Ciccolini swarmed Rose as the 
first period waned. With a little over 
50 seconds on the clock, all three 
crashed the net as Bowling Green’s 
defenders could only watch. Before 

they could even poke 
their sticks at the loose 
puck, the red light cast a 
glowing aura on the goal. 
The Wolverines’ speed 
won again.

Speed in the bottom 

six could be an X-factor 
against tough opponents. 
As Michigan’s stars draw 
the undivided attention 
of opposing defensemen, 
speed 
like 
Lambert’s 

can bring advantages 
against 
worn-out 

players. That difference 
could lead to secondary 
scoring in close contests, 
something that didn’t 
often happen in intense 
games last year.

While 
there’s 
no 

guarantee that this speed 
will stack up against 
teams like Duluth or 
Minnesota — teams full 
of talent and conditioned 
to a T — the increase in 

speed could bode well for forcing the 
pace of play down the line. With as 
much talent as this roster boasts, the 
Wolverines can turn that speed into 
additional goals.

If Michigan can keep up its speed, 

the wolf will be eating more often than 
not.

The game was in a deadlock, 

neither 
team 
converting 
their 

chances. That is, until 21 minutes 
into the second half, when Michigan 
men’s soccer team junior defender 
Brennan Callow got called for a 
tripping foul, setting up an Indiana 
penalty 
kick. 
Forward 
Victor 

Bezerra buried the shot to make it a 
1-0 game. 

The Wolverines (5-4-1 overall, 

2-1-0 Big Ten) played the Hoosiers 
(5-3-1, 2-2-0) in Bloomington, Ind., 
on Friday night. Looking for their 
second straight Big Ten victory, 
they found themselves trailing late 
in the second half. But following a 
game-saving goal in the 81st minute, 
Michigan forced it into overtime, 
where senior forward Derick Broche 

would score to win the game, 2-1.

The first half of the game was 

controlled 
by 
Indiana, 
which 

connected on deep passes to set up 
scoring opportunities and allowed 
its forwards to create traffic in front 
of the Wolverines’ net. 

“They 
kind 
of 
worked 
our 

goalkeepers and we did not do that 
from our standpoint,” Michigan 
head coach Chaka Daley said.

Despite 
their 
abundance 
of 

chances, 
the 
Hoosiers 
couldn’t 

capitalize 
on 
any 
of 
them. 

Wolverines freshman goaltender 
Hayden Evans was up to the 
challenge, making three first-half 
saves.

With almost a minute left in the 

first half, Indiana defender Daniel 
Munie worked his way to the front 
of the net for a clean shot. Evans, 
however, made a huge stop in front 
of the net to keep the game scoreless 

heading into halftime. 

Michigan wished to have more 

scoring chances in the first half. 
Instead, it was rewarded with 
stellar play from their goaltender. 
Every time the Hoosiers made a shot 
on net, Evans came up with the save, 
finishing the game with seven total 
saves.

Nine minutes into the second 

half, Indiana moved the ball down 
the field to find forward Maouloune 
Goumballe wide open for an almost 
certain goal on the right side of the 
net. But at the last second, Evans 
deflected the ball out of bounds 
with the fingertips of his gloves. 

“Evans was strong and solid,” 

Daley said. “He gave us a chance 
when it was 0-0.”

Following 
Callow’s 
goal, 
it 

appeared as if the Hoosiers were 
going to walk away victorious. The 
momentum was heavily on their 

side, with the home crowd also 
providing energy. But Michigan 
did not fold. After booting the ball 
deep into Indiana’s defensive third, 
junior forward Evan Rasmussen 
scored a critical goal to tie the game. 

“We 
caused 
them 
some 

problems,” Daley said. “It was not 
a comfortable afternoon for their 
guys in the back.” 

The momentum carried into 

overtime as the Wolverines were 
able to get the ball into the Hoosiers’ 
zone. Rasmussen sent a corner kick 
into the box, which found the head 
of senior defender Declan Gaffney. 
Gaffney sent the ball to Broche, who 
knocked in the overtime winner, 
their first shot of overtime.

“We asked a lot of questions, we 

asked more questions than they 
could answer,” Daley said. “That 
was ultimately the difference in the 
end.”

Michigan men’s soccer completes comeback for 2-1 OT victory

MARK PATRICK

Coming out of high school, football 

fans knew Roman Wilson as a burner. 
Considering his 4.37 40-yard dash 
time, that reputation was warranted.

But during Saturday’s 38-17 win 

over Wisconsin, the sophomore wide 
receiver stood out for other reasons. 
His team-leading six catches and 81 
yards were a product of crisp route 
running and separation rather than 
pure speed. Both marks also set a 
new career-high, a testament to his 
connection with junior quarterback 
Cade McNamara.

“(Wilson) is growing leaps and 

bounds,” 
Michigan 
coach 
Jim 

Harbaugh said Saturday. “… It’s 
almost like some of those X-Men 
movies, where the little kid or the 
teenage X-Man finds their power. 
Now they know they have it, and 
they’re using it. It’s really exciting to 
watch as a coach.”

Watching Wilson’s high school 

film, it doesn’t take long to notice 
a trend. The Hawaii native made a 
name for himself as a national recruit 
by repeatedly burning defensive 
backs over the top, helping Saint Louis 
High School win four consecutive 
state titles. Wilson racked up long 
touchdowns during the fall and 
spent the spring running sprints and 
jumping for the school’s track and 
field team.

But during his first two years 

in Ann Arbor, he’s grown in ways 
beyond blazing speed. Wilson is no 
longer just a deep threat, and some 
of his most important catches for the 
Wolverines so far have come on short 
and intermediate throws.

Take Saturday, for example. With 

Michigan facing a 4th-and-two near 
midfield, McNamara hit Wilson in 
stride on a short out route to move the 
sticks. At another point, McNamara 
took a downfield shot to Wilson, who 
timed the ball perfectly for a leaping 
catch on 3rd-and-10.

“Roman Wilson, of anybody, had 

the best day,” Harbaugh said Monday. 
“Offensive player of the game, et 
cetera. Fabulous-type catches.”

Wilson no longer has to rely on 

speed alone to make an impact on 
Saturdays. After developing the 
footwork to run short routes to 
perfection and the skills to make 
contested catches against physical 
Big Ten cornerbacks, he’s proven 
himself as a versatile threat.

Senior wideout Ronnie Bell’s 

season-ending knee injury left the 
team’s receiving corps with plenty 
of questions, but Wilson’s emergence 
has provided an answer. He lacks 
Bell’s experience, but his rapid 
growth has allowed him to find 
consistency over the first half of the 
season.

“I don’t know how much you 

can really tell from just looking at 
somebody’s eyes, but the demeanor,” 
Harbaugh said. “And then he’s 
catching the ball. Getting open, 
catching the ball, blocking. His 
blocking has improved so much.”

In just five weeks, Wilson has 

already matched his reception total 
and surpassed his yardage total from 
last season. And as he comes into his 
own, the Wolverines are reaping the 
benefits of establishing yet another 
offensive weapon.

But unlike the X-Men finding 

their 
powers, 
Wilson’s 
drastic 

improvement 
isn’t 
a 
sudden 

discovery.

“Roman’s been working,” senior 

receiver 
Daylen 
Baldwin 
said 

Monday. “All the receivers, we’ve 
just been pushing each other in ways 
I don’t even think we know at the end 
of the day. I go out there and make 
a good block, that might inspire 
Roman to make a good block. Roman 
goes out there and makes a good 
catch, that might inspire me to make 
sure I catch the next couple footballs 
that come to me.

“We’re 
pushing 
each 
other 

without even noticing, and we’re 
making each other a lot better.”

Earlier this week, an SB Nation poll 

showed that the majority of Michigan 
football fans weren’t confident in 
junior Cade McNamara as the starting 
quarterback.

It’s an easy 

conclusion 
to 

draw when — 
prior 
to 
this 

week’s matchup 
— 
more 
than 

80% 
of 
the 

Wolverines’ 
touchdowns 
had 
come 
on 

the 
ground 

and especially when, other than 
an 
87-yard 
touchdown 
against 

Northern Illinois, McNamara had 
done little to show he can carry the 
offense when the run game can’t.

That changed on Saturday. Against 

Wisconsin, he showed that mistrust 
was doled out prematurely. 

It’s no secret that up until this 

point, 
Michigan 
has 
primarily 

chosen to run the ball. Coming into 
this Saturday, the Wolverines were 
averaging 290.8 rushing yards per 
game compared to just 164 in the air. 
Meanwhile, Wisconsin holds the 
nation’s top rushing defense, having 
held its first three opponents to an 
average of 23 rushing yards.

And 
Michigan 
knows 
what 

happens when a team figures 
out how to stop its run game. It 
happened last weekend: Rutgers 
held the Wolverines to a season-low 
112 rushing yards, and McNamara 
did little to pick up the slack. He 
played a decent first half, completing 
8-of-11 passes for 156 yards, but his 
performance fell off later in the game, 
completing just 1-of-5 passes for seven 
yards in the second half. Michigan 
eked out a win while relying on a 
stymied run game that kept trying to 

shove a round peg into a square hole. 
Still, the struggles did little to damper 
Michigan’s confidence in its passing 
game.

“I think throughout the season, 

our intermediate stuff has been really 
good,” McNamara said on Sept. 27. 
“We’ve thrown it deep in the game, 
(and) we’ve been able to do that really 
well, so I think we’re building. … 
When we’re in those scenarios where 
we have to throw our way back into a 
game, I think I’m more than capable 
of doing that.”

And on Saturday, McNamara and 

his receivers followed through. It 
started with a 34-yard flea-flicker 
touchdown pass to junior receiver 
Cornelius Johnson in the first 
quarter and ended with another 
aerial play to Johnson that put 
Michigan up by 21 in the fourth 
quarter. In between those highlight-
reel moments, McNamara proved 
himself with smart, consistent 
second-half plays that culminated in 
17 completed passes on 28 attempts 
for a total of 197 years — a season-
high. 

While the passing game was 

markedly improved from previous 
weeks, it still wasn’t perfect. The first 
half was riddled with juggled balls 
and missed targets. McNamara threw 
10 incomplete passes in the first two 
quarters. While some fault was on the 
receivers, McNamara’s throws were 
frequently misplaced, often lagging 
behind the route-runner. 

The offensive performance was as 

much a testament to the receivers as 
the quarterbacks themselves. With 
about 10:48 minutes left in the third 
quarter, sophomore receiver Roman 
Wilson sprung up behind a Badger 
cornerback to snag a seemingly-
uncatchable 38-yard bomb from 
McNamara on third-and-ten. Four 

plays later, J.J. McCarthy snuck the 
ball into the end zone with a one-yard 
rush. 

Often, McCarthy proved himself 

to be a valuable supplement to 
McNamara’s offense. In the fourth 
quarter, the freshman quarterback 
extended the Wolverines’ lead to 28 
with a 56-yard touchdown pass to 
senior receiver Daylen Baldwin. The 
flashes of brilliance that have come 
from McCarthy, combined with 
fits and bursts from McNamara so 
far this season, are leading some 
Michigan fans to hope for a switch in 

the starter. 

But, if the Wolverines’ coaching 

staff is to be believed, McNamara’s 
starting position has never been in 
danger. Nor should it be. 

In the season opener, McNamara 

registered 
136 
yards 
for 
two 

touchdowns. At the time, the mark 
was the second-highest in his 
Michigan career. Two weeks later 
against the Huskies, that number 
was up to 191. Two weeks later — this 
weekend against the Badgers — he 
topped it again for 197 yards. 

None of this is to say that those are 

stellar, game-changing numbers. But 
they’re going in the right direction. 

By the time the second half started, 

McNamara’s mistakes were few and 
far between. The throws and catches 
looked much cleaner in the final two 
quarters, evidenced by McNamara 
completing 6-of-7 attempts. 

“I kind of knew going into this 

game that it would be difficult to 
run the ball,” McNamara said after 
Saturday’s game. “I accepted the 
challenge, and we got the dub.” 

Why start a competition at 

quarterback after Michigan won 

on the road at Camp Randall for the 
first time since 2001? After the first 
underdog win of Jim Harbaugh’s 
tenure? After a 5-0 start to a 
season that began with bare-bones 
expectations? 

As the old saying goes, if it ain’t 

broke, don’t throw a wrench in your 
entire offensive scheme to fix it. 

Maybe McNamara won’t throw an 

85-yard-game-winning touchdown 
against Ohio State next month, but, 
for now, he’s getting the job done. 

And that’s all Michigan fans 

should ask for.

MADELINE HINKLEY/Daily 

In leading Michigan to a dominant victory in Madison, Cade McNamara continued to silence critics. 

MADISON — On Tuesday, Mazi 

Smith stood beside Schembechler 
Hall and grinned in anticipation 
of the Michigan football team’s 
pending trip to Wisconsin. 

“Going 
into 

somebody else’s 
place and trying 
to take it from 
them… it shows 
you 
who 
you 

really are,” the 
junior defensive 
tackle said. 

Early in the 

fourth 
quarter 

on Saturday, when junior receiver 
Cornelius Johnson executed a toe-
tap touchdown catch in the corner 
of the endzone, posing in front of 
an abandoned student section, who 
they are was abundantly clear. The 
5-0 Wolverines, fresh off a 38-17 
thrashing of the Badgers, are a 
legitimate contender. 

In essence, they are who they 

thought they were — it’s just a 
version of themselves that few 
others envisioned. 

“These last few years, we’ve 

done enough flinching,” junior 
defensive back Dax Hill said after 
the game. “We didn’t want to feel 
that way anymore.” 

For 
the 
past 
six 
months, 

Michigan has spoken ad nauseum 
about its culture change, rattling 
off platitudes about a revamped 
locker room and the benefits of 
a young coaching staff. From 
an outsider’s perspective, those 
buzzword-ladened refrains tend 
to sound artificial. Without any 
tangible on-field success, they 
would ring hollow. 

Through 
five 
games, 
the 

Wolverines have made good on 
their word. 

“We’ve taken control of this 

year and I think we made the 
changes that we wanted,” junior 
quarterback 
Cade 
McNamara 

said. “We know that’s not gonna 
be easy to be different, but so far 
what you’re seeing right now is 
just a reflection of everything that 
we’ve preached, everything we 
tried to make a difference for in the 
offseason.” 

Camp Randall Stadium has 

been a house of horrors for 
Michigan for the better part of 
this century. Before Saturday, 
the Wolverineswere winless in 
Madison since 2001. Often, the 
trip to Wisconsin has induced a 
sobering reality, rendering any sort 
of early season success a facade. 

This go-around had the opposite 

effect, 
solidifying 
Michigan’s 

undefeated record. The Wolverines 
both exorcised demons from past 

visits and backed up their season-
long conviction. 

McNamara spent the majority 

of September insisting that he 
was capable of leading Michigan’s 
offense through the passing game. 
The fact that he beat out 5-star 
freshman J.J. McCarthy without 
a competition and steered the 
Wolverines to a 4-0 start did little 
to stave off critics.

And yet on Saturday, playing 

in front of fans on the road for the 
first time in his collegiate career, 
McNamara threw for 197 yards and 
two touchdowns while Michigan’s 
potent rushing attack managed just 
112 yards on 44 carries. McNamara 
had his fair share of hiccups, but he 
showed poise under pressure, made 
throws on the run and executed 
on a number of critical third and 
fourth down conversions. 

The 
defensive 
line, 
which 

seems to be perpetually gashed 
by 
Wisconsin’s 
run 
game, 

wreaked havoc in the backfield, 
creating continuous pressure and 

allowing just 43 rushing yards. 
You wouldn’t be faulted for doing 
a double-take as Michigan players 
shedded blocks and flew around 
the edge with ease, demoralizing 
the Badgers’ typically dominant 
offensive line. 

“A lot of our players, it’s a pretty 

young team,” Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh said. “It’s almost 
like some of those X-Men movies 
where the little kid, the teenage 
X-Men find the power. Now they 
know they have it, and they’re 
using it. It’s really exciting to watch 
as a coach.” 

This 
sort 
of 
growth 
and 

improvement from last season’s 
disastrous 2-4 campaign wasn’t 
supposed to happen this quickly. 
Sure, Wisconsin and Washington, 
who stand as the Wolverines’ two 
marquee victories on the season, 
are programs seemingly marred in 
down years. But Michigan entered 
this season in the same boat, with 
question marks up and down the 
roster and expectations on the 
floor. 

From the very first possession, 

Michigan played with a sense 
of urgency, representative of a 
team conscious of the game’s 
importance. The Wolverines twice 
went for it on fourth down in their 
own half of the field. In total, 
they converted four out of five 
fourth down attempts, including 
a one-yard touchdown run from 
McCarthy. 

“It’s a statement, a statement 

play,” 
sophomore 
receiver 

RomanwWilson 
said 
of 
the 

fourth down aggression. “We 

want to win and we’re not gonna 
back down.” 

The game featured everything 

that Michigan fans have spent 
the last few weeks clamoring for. 
There was a more ordinary run-
pass balance, with 30 passing 
attempts compared to 44 carries; 
a blend of creativity, with a series 
of end-arounds to sophomore 
receiver A.J. Henning and even a 
34-yard flea-flicker touchdown to 
Johnson; and even semi-regular 
appearances 
from 
McCarthy, 

whose speed adds an intriguing 
layer to the offense. 

That’s not to say the win was 

perfect, but no game is going to be 
flawless. Michigan proved it can 
win in spite of its shortcomings, 
a trait of resiliency absent from 
last year’s group and one that 
Harbaugh said he felt when he 
arrived at the stadium Saturday 
morning. 

“A vibe that they weren’t gonna 

be denied,” Harbaugh said. 

The 
prevailing 
image 
of 

Saturday’s demolition occurred 
in between the third and fourth 
quarter, when “Jump Around,” 
Wisconsin’s 
adopted 
anthem, 

blared through the stadium. The 
Michigan sideline, players and 
coaches alike, spilled onto the field, 
thrusting their arms into the air 
and waving towels. Across the way, 
Wisconsin, trailing 20-10, stood 
stoic. 

It’s 
a 
scene 
that 
seemed 

inconceivable just a few weeks 
ago. And yet, in spite of the 
celebration, 
the 
Wolverines 

continue 
to 
maintain 
the 

mentality that has carried them 
this far. 

“We have big goals,” junior 

edge 
rusher 
David 
Ojabo 

said. “You can’t come in all 
complacent. It’s just day-by-day, 
week-by-week. Can’t be high-
fiving each other thinking we 
won a championship. We haven’t 
done anything yet.” 

In that context, they haven’t. 

But they have proven to be a bona 
fide contender in the Big Ten, 
something few would have thought 
a month back — except for the 
Wolverines themselves.

M

ADISON 
— 
The 
narratives 

entering Saturday’s game were 
plentiful. 

Despite 
five 
different 
opportunities, 

the Michigan football team hadn’t won 
at Camp Randall Stadium since 2001. In 
those matchups, Wisconsin outscored the 
Wolverines by a combined 75 points, and 
in the last two meetings specifically, the 
Badgers emphatically exposed Michigan’s 
greatest flaws, from its weak run defense to 
its inept rushing offense. 

Each time, it seemed, the worst version 

of the Wolverines would arrive in Madison, 
take a punch and fall helplessly to the mat. 

On Saturday, Michigan punched back. 
The Wolverines (5-0 overall, 2-0 Big 

Ten) trounced Wisconsin (1-3, 0-2), 38-17, 
earning a marquee road win for coach Jim 
Harbaugh’s rebuilding program. Unlike in 
previous years, Michigan managed to absorb 
the Badgers’ best shots while remaining in 
control the whole way. 

“They did beat us the past two years,” 

junior receiver Cornelius Johnson said. “… 

So we really wanted to make sure we put 
a special emphasis on this one, to come 
into their building and make sure we put 
something good on tape.”

Somewhat surprisingly, many of the 

Wolverines’ best strikes came through the air. 
After averaging a meager 164 passing yards 
per game going into Saturday, Michigan and 
offensive coordinator Josh Gattis recognized 
that Wisconsin would try to stop the run — it 
was best in the country in doing so. 

So, from the start, Gattis opted for a 

closer balance between the run and the 
pass. Despite some early hiccups, junior 
quarterback Cade McNamara boosted the 
offense when needed. 

He had help from sophomore receiver 

Roman Wilson, who used his speed to create 
separation where he hadn’t in previous 
games. On a 3rd-and-14 midway through 
the first quarter, McNamara hit Wilson on a 
quick out for a 12-yard gain, then found him 
again on a crossing route to convert on fourth 
down. A play later, McNamara connected 
with junior receiver Cornelius Johnson on 
a perfectly executed flea flicker to open up 
the scoring. A pair of field goals from senior 
kicker Jake Moody extended that lead.

“I think the difference in us this year is 

that, when we’re expecting to be in a fight, 
we’re confident we’re gonna win that fight,” 
McNamara said. “And I think this team 
didn’t panic at all. When the fight came to us, 
we attacked back.”

Still, the Badgers didn’t lie down. Despite 

finding practically no offense for much of the 
first two quarters, the usually unreliable arm 
of quarterback Graham Mertz led Wisconsin 
to a field goal and one touchdown drive 
that cut Michigan’s lead to three at the half. 
For the first time all game, the Wolverines 
appeared vulnerable. 

In the second half, though, Michigan 

came out swinging. After a 38-yard deep 
ball to Wilson set up a 1st-and-goal from 
the 10, freshman quarterback J.J. McCarthy 
ultimately snuck it in for the Wolverines’ 
second touchdown of the game. 

“It’s a tribute to our brotherhood, man,” 

junior edge rusher David Ojabo said. “We 
came into the locker room (at halftime), and 
we just said like, ‘Let’s not panic. We got 
each other’s back through ups and downs.’ 
We really weren’t worried.”

From there, it was Wisconsin that failed 

to recover. After a blistering sack from 
Michigan junior safety Daxton Hill knocked 
a struggling Mertz out of the game, the 

Badgers’ already poor offense slipped into 
full-on anemia, tallying two punts, a fumble 
and an interception from Hill on its next four 
drives. 

The 
Wolverines’ 
offense, 
meanwhile, 

continued to deliver blows — first with a field 
goal after the fumble recovery and then with 
a back-corner touchdown pass to Johnson 
that sealed the victory.

“They had that kind of vibe about them 

from when they first stepped in the locker 
room when we got there early this morning,” 
Harbaugh said. “The vibe was they weren’t 
gonna be denied, and they weren’t gonna 
flinch when punches were thrown.” 

Even if Wisconsin isn’t the marquee 

opponent it normally is — Mertz’s struggles 
throughout the season have mostly derailed 
the team’s offense — Michigan’s win still 
represents a turning point for the program. 
The Badgers entered this game as the 
nation’s top rushing defense; the Wolverines 
were an offense intent on keeping the ball on 
the ground. It was clear Michigan would face 
a barrage of quick hits.

For what feels like the first time in forever, 

the Wolverines dealt some knockout blows of 
their own. We’ll see how they deal with the 
heavyweights later on.

Climate change is ravaging the planet. Wildlife 

populations are diminishing rapidly around the 
world. The Earth is dying — and it’s all our fault.

This mantra cycles through my head every day, 

guiding my actions as I move through my daily 
routine.

“Can you turn off the lights?” “Did you make sure 

to shut off the TV before you left the room?” “You 
don’t need to keep the water running while you’re 
washing dishes; you only need it for rinsing.”

I have said all of these things and more to my 

roommates on a regular basis. Even the smallest 
action left undone fills me with anxiety about 
the possible negative impact it could have on the 
environment. I stopped eating red meat. I attend 
climate protests at state Capitol buildings. I walk 
or take the bus on campus. My mindset has gone 
beyond just doing what I can to promote the envi-
ronmentalist cause — my stressors have instead 
morphed into a never-ending checklist that must 
be completed or the world will fall apart. Yet, even 
if I do accomplish every task, my personal actions 
still won’t be enough to stop what’s already hap-
pening. It won’t be enough to erase what genera-
tions of human activity, industry and development 
have already done to the natural world. 

The barrage of warning signs indicating the 

planet’s Armageddon are inescapable in today’s 
world. Reports of dangerous weather events, 
species endangerment and worsening climate 
emergencies are constant reminders of the state 
of the Earth. Whether seen on the news, viewed 
on an Instagram story or learned in class, distress-
ing details of these issues flood every medium of 
communication. It was precisely the prevalence 
of these crises that inspired me to pursue a minor 
in Environment when coming to the University of 
Michigan. And despite knowing my education in 
environmental science will only make me more 
prepared to take on the challenges of climate 
change, it also reminds me of everything I’m up 
against. 

It’s hard to feel inspired to create change when 

your classes are designed to inform you about 
increasing emissions and the detrimental effects 
of the Anthropocene. 

All of these experiences force me to constantly 

ask myself: Are my individual actions pointless? 
Do we have to completely redesign our lives to 
make a “sustainable” world? Is it too late to do 
anything?

Sustainability is Trending

In an age of widespread environmental aware-

ness and activism, the concept of a sustainable 
lifestyle has become more mainstream, especially 
among members of Gen Z. Reusable water bottles, 
thrifted clothing and metal straws are staples in 
many young people’s homes. Many restaurants, 
and even U-M dining halls, have shifted to com-
postable packaging to reduce their plastic waste.

Large corporations have joined in on the trend 

to appeal to today’s environmentally conscious 
consumers. In 2018, Starbucks changed its dispos-
able cups to a design that doesn’t require the use of 
a straw. In April of this year, they launched their 
Earth Month Game: an interactive experience 

in which customers can play games of chance 
or complete Tetris-like puzzles right from their 
phones. As they complete the levels, players can 
choose which environmental initiative they’d like 
the company to support, including clean water 
and habitat rehabilitation. Participants also get 
the chance to win in-store prizes while learning 
about what drink or food substitutions they can 
make for a more sustainable diet.

On a surface level, these actions show great 

initiative. In a society where a small number 
of companies are responsible for almost three-
quarters of greenhouse gas emissions, seeing 
large corporations actively spread information on 
sustainable consumption seems like a step in the 
right direction. But there is a caveat to consider: 
Though these big-name businesses are promot-
ing sustainable practices, their approach puts all 
of the responsibility on the consumer instead of 
the producer. In turn, they fail to adapt the very 
actions they’re advocating for. And in reality, the 
“steps” they have taken to become more environ-
mentally conscious may not even truly be helping: 
less than 1% of the world’s plastic pol-
lution 

comes from disposable straws and 
the combination of their strawless 
lids and cup actually equates to a 
greater amount of plastic than their 
original design.

Starbucks is just one of many com-

panies that advertises their commit-
ment to sustainable practices while 
neglecting to examine or address 
the actions that are actually the 
most problematic. This phenom-
enon, called greenwashing, allows 
companies to market their “green” 
actions for a better public image 
without making true positive 
change.

Volkswagen and IKEA have 

also been confronted with similar 
issues of greenwashing. In 2015, 
the car company used a special-
ly designed device to pass emis-
sions tests without actually 
reducing their carbon waste. 
As for IKEA, the company has 
historically been praised for its 
sustainable practices, including 
a “buy-back” program where 
they repurchased customers’ old 
furniture for resale at a reduced 
price. Yet despite this admirable 
effort, the furniture conglomerate 
was later linked to illegal logging prac-
tices in Ukraine.

In many cases, it seems like sustain-

ability is used as a marketing ploy instead 
of an actual commitment to improvement, 
with companies putting their “best foot for-
ward” for the sake of advertising and consumer 
appeal. Dr. Stuart Kirsch, a professor of Anthro-
pology at the University, criticized the mass mar-
ket’s commodification of the term “sustainability” 
in an interview. He emphasized that those who do 
pursue eco-friendly actions will be better off in 

the long run as the government implements more 
environmental regulations.

“I have raised concerns about the ease with 

which we use the term ‘sustainability,’ to the point 
that we sometimes lose track of what it actually 
means,” Kirsch said. “Corporations benefit from 
their appropriation of the terms of their critique, 
claiming to be responsible, sustainable and trans-
parent while watering these terms down or rede-
fining them in ways that reproduce the status quo.”

But the issue of sustainability doesn’t just affect 

large corporations — small businesses feel the 
impact on a much more day-to-day scale. Due to 
their size, non-corporate companies are often left 
behind in the race for sustainability, with items 
such as compostable packaging often much more 
expensive than other standardized products.

If these large-scale corporations are doing lit-

tle, or nothing, to improve environmental condi-
tions, placing pressure on the individual to change 
their habits can feel overwhelming and almost 
impossible in a modern capitalist society with so 
many other issues to address. In her Ted Talk, 
“What to do when climate change feels unstop-

pable,” activ-

ist 

Clover Hogan 

dives into this concept of 
“eco-anxiety:” a helpless, counter-
productive and guilty feeling that 
many young people experience as 

we witness disaster after disas-

ter arise as a result of climate 

change and human activ-

ity. She specifies that eco-

anxiety has culminated 

in a surge of mental 

health issues for 

many individ-

uals around 

the 

world. 

This eco-anxiety is the root of my mindset 

as I complete my daily checklist, repeating my 
mantra in my head. But why is this mentality so 
particularly prevalent among individuals in our 
age group? Hogan perfectly articulates why 
Gen Z-ers especially feel this immense pressure 
to solve the world’s environmental problems: 
“Young people today have not created this real-
ity. We’ve inherited it. Yet we’re told we’re the 
last generation with a chance to save the fate of 
humanity … And in the war against nature, young 
minds are the collateral.”

Dominance of the Collective

In the case of sustainability, the dissonance 

between individual and collective action can 
result in fear or distress over the choices we make: 
Should we even bother playing our part in the 
push for environmentalism if we don’t make sub-
stantial change, or should we shoulder the burden 
of everyone else not advocating?

It’s an example of the collective action prob-

lem in which individuals believe that their role in 
a large scenario will not make a difference in the 
grand scope of the issue. This occurs within many 
contexts, including election voting.

C

omical threads fill websites like Reddit 
and Quora with anonymous users who 

pose questions like these: “Why do many of the 
extreme feminists have short hair or buzz cuts? 
Is it a symbol of not conforming to long hair, or do 
they just like short hair? No hate or spite started 
this. It’s just my curiosity.”

The fixation on women and short hair is by 

no means unique to the modern-day. In 1915, the 
famous ballroom dancer Irene Castle cut her hair 
just below her ears for convenience ahead of an 
appendectomy — she kept it short after the sur-
gery, creating the “Castle Bob.” Castle, a reputa-
tion trend-setter, rattled American traditionalists 
with her new look. In 1920, the Women’s Suffrage 
movement gained traction with the ratification 
of the 19th Amendment, and as more women 
joined the workforce during World War I, short 
hair took on a new meaning as an act against tra-
ditional ideas of femininity. Following suit, mid-
20th-century actresses like Audrey Hepburn and 
Joan Crawford sported bobs, pervading popular 
culture with the ethos of an independent, mod-
ern woman. The 1970s and 80s brought layers 
and texture to the hairstyle, and by the end of the 
20th century, the pixie cut saw a rise in popular-
ity. Victoria Beckham and Halle Berry, in the 
early 2000s, continued the look of short hair with 
stacked bobs and tapered cuts. 

Fictional worlds, of course, have reflected this 

trend: the unsettling Margo Tenenbaum from 
“The Royal Tenenbaums,” the odd Amélie from 
“Amélie,” troubled Susanna Kaysen from “Girl, 
Interrupted.” The alluring Mia Wallace, from 
“Pulp Fiction,” Mathilda in “Léon: The Profes-
sional,” the prodigious Beth Harmon in “The 
Queen’s Gambit.”

These characters’ short haircuts, while vary-

ing in shortness, ultimately achieve a familiar 
brand of identity: cool girl. Cool unsettling girl. 
Cool odd girl. Cool troubled girl. Cool alluring girl. 
Cool troubled troubled girl. Cool prodigy girl. So 
it seems that popular culture’s idea of a cool girl, a 
postmodern girl, is one that makes a show of her 
femininity while also rejecting it — an intriguing 

contradiction that directors tend to like. 

What exactly are we doing when we associate 

say, a haircut, with an identity, a persona? Would 
Margo Tenenbaum still be the same character, 
still have the same intrigue, if she had long hair? 
Or if she didn’t smoke cigarettes or wear a shock of 
a fur coat? Appearance as identity is a dangerous 
thing to buy into, except of course, when it makes 
for a good film. 

In our postmodern world, appearance as iden-

tity has only become more of a complex and sticky 
matrix. Anthony Giddens has a cerebral term for 
what we’ve endeavored our bodies to become: a 
“reflexive project.” In our 21st century, the pre-
sentation of the self has become more and more of 
a false narrative, a canvas onto which we project 
who we hope to become, not who we actually are. 
Who actually, then, are we? 

~
I’ve always admired girls with short hair, espe-

cially if it’s especially short, hugging the jawline or 
swirling in curlier strands near the ears. I’ve seen 
the same woman with bobbed, wind-whipped, 
honey-colored hair biking down my street every 
week, earrings wagging, all business. After a week 
of seeing this woman and thinking hard about the 
state of my own appearance, how all of my clothes 
seemed to fit having short hair anyway, I got mine 
cut. It’s like by getting my hair cut just as short 
as hers, I might also attain her confidence, and 
maybe even her bike.

I wasn’t trying to make a statement by cutting 

my hair short, at least not consciously. I was just 
trying to get a haircut, to prove to myself that I can 
still do bold things and say to myself later that night 
in the harsh mirror of my bathroom, this suits me. 

Could it be true that by walking out of the salon 

on a cool Monday, with the now exposed nape of 
my neck, I destabilized, on some level, my femi-
nine side? I certainly felt lighter, less burdened. 
The curled ends of my hair bobbed with every 
step, animating my walk with a bit more energy 
than I usually carry.

Having such short hair feels like I’m wearing a 

costume, like the formidable Joan of Arc (the 1903 

portrayal by Albert Lynch), or like the sleek Lou-
ise Brooks — like it’s not actually me, but instead 
some much cooler version, one I could never actu-
ally be. 

This haircut feels jaded or makes me look 

jaded, even when I don’t intend to. And it’s always 
when I try to look disaffected that I feel the most 
affected, a comical sort of paradox that prevents 
me from putting on a show. 

This haircut makes me feel French, and I am 

French, but French Canadian. I should’ve said: 
This haircut makes me feel French Parisian. 
This haircut feels like the vivid cool of smoking a 
cigarette for the first time, this haircut feels like 
drumming nails on countertops, this haircut feels 
like wearing gloves in painting class instead of 
not wearing them, a ladylike and cleanly thing to 
do which for so long I’ve avoided until my hands 
cracked dry from the oils.

This haircut feels like it exists between girl and 

lady, but I hate both of those words anyway. This 
haircut feels like the candied thrill of Coke in a 
glass bottle, this haircut feels like disobeying the 
grip of my ponytail holder every time I step out 
the door for a few miles at lunchtime, this haircut 
seems to accentuate my bad posture, this haircut 
feels like calling instead of texting, this haircut 
feels like the shapeless comfort of a shift dress, 
this haircut feels like the smart plunk of a chess 
piece touching down. 

This haircut feels like the only poet I’ve ever 

really loved might be Frank O’Hara, this haircut 
feels like a holiday train ride, this haircut feels 
like its curls mimic the pensive windup of an 
analog clock, this haircut feels like not taking my 
makeup off before bed, this haircut feels like the 
acrid taste of whiskey, this haircut feels, when 
straightened into submission by the force of 410 
degrees, like the unconvincing charm of a 1950s 
actress, this haircut feels like the purchase of a 
leather jacket which is somehow religious, this 
haircut feels like being late and not walking any 
faster, this haircut feels, especially when seen in 
silhouette, like I’ve become a paper doll, weight-
less and newly lovely. 

This haircut feels like not replying to what is 

intended to provoke me, this haircut feels like 
reading the lucid prose of Rachel Cusk or Rachel 
Kushner, this haircut feels like only smiling when 
I want to, not because I have to, this haircut feels 
like the unmatched bliss of noise-canceling head-
phones, this haircut feels like not deleting search 
histories, unashamed of the curiosities and check-
ins, this haircut feels like skipping school, which is 
something I can’t do without a great big stomach 
ache coming on.

This haircut feels like the estranged voice of 

Aimee Mann in her hit song “Save Me,” this hair-
cut feels like liking small talk for what it reveals 
about a person, this haircut feels like walking 
around in the rain without an umbrella, this hair-
cut feels like it deals in the business of never being 
dull, being fearful of it actually, this haircut knows 
bad things always happen on Sundays, this hair-
cut feels like dancing to “Fantastic Man” by Wil-
liam Onyeabor in spite of Sundays.

This haircut, then, feels like not caring, which 

is hard because all I’ve ever done is try to disguise 
the fact that I do indeed care. I care whether peo-
ple like me or not, or if they could look at me on the 
street and say I can tell that you’re a good person, 
I care whether people like my writing or not, this 
very sentence. I care about what people would say 
if I were to, very suddenly, stop talking altogether. 

This haircut, then, is who I feel I am but also 

who I wish I was because while I love Frank 
O’Hara, I don’t play chess and I, though I’m get-
ting better at it, find it incredibly difficult not to 
respond to what provokes me. And I’m still scared 
of Sundays no matter how many miles I run the 
morning of.

“To what extent is ‘identity’ a normative ideal 

rather than a descriptive feature of experience?” 
asked Judith Butler in her groundbreaking 1990 
book, “Gender Trouble.” After all, what really is 
our identity? Is it the choices we make? Is it the 
things we say? Is it what we believe, but don’t wish 
to discuss? Is it all of it or is it none of it?

I’ve joked around and said that I cut my hair so 

that I was more recognizable as an art major, and 
while this was mostly a joke, not all of it was. By 
cutting my hair, I may have been pushing against 
more conservative ideas about women’s appear-
ances and femininity itself, but by cutting my hair, 
I also may have been playing into what I think I 
should look like. 

I think, in fact I know, that I got my hair cut 

because I was bored of my appearance. I felt it 
lacked a certain intrigue, which is, most definitely, 
a sad belief of mine that has to do with perfor-
mance: My identity, despite the first letter of the 
word, is not for me. It is for others to watch and to 
be entertained by. 

But how, in the age we live in, could this not be 

the case? 

We’re lying to ourselves when we say that we 

do things just because we want to. We may very 
well have desires that could look like our own, but 
those desires are shaped by the desires of others, 
à la René Girad’s mimetic theory. We want things 
because other people want them. We do things 
because other people do them.

How a summer of church burnings ignited a new 
understanding of my religious identity
BY MARY ROLFES

STATEMENT CORRESPONDENT

A few years ago, as part of a summer profes-

sional development experience, I was asked for 
the first time to complete a Social Identity Wheel. 
LSA’s Inclusive Teaching website describes the 
Social Identity Wheel as “an activity that encour-
ages students to identify social identities and 
reflect on the various ways those identities become 
visible or more keenly felt at different times, and 
how those identities impact the ways others per-
ceive or treat them.” The version that LSA uses, 
and the one I completed, asks participants to iden-
tify themselves across 11 social identities (such as 
race, gender and socioeconomic status), and then 
to “categorize those identities based on which 
matter most in their self-perception and which 
matter most in others’ 
perception of them.”

Describing myself in 

terms of the 11 param-
eters was fairly straight-
forward, as was picking 
out the identities I “think 
about most often.” When 
I arrived at the second 
categorization question, 
identities I “think about 
least often,” only one of 
the 11 options jumped out 
as belonging here: “Reli-
gious or Spiritual Affili-
ation.” While I thought 
about some of my social 
identities more than oth-
ers, spirituality fell far 
behind the rest — upon 
reflection, I realized I 
rarely thought about my 
religious affiliation at all. In fact, the only times I 
consciously pondered this specific identity were 
the instances in which I was specifically asked 
to identify it, whether it be on an online survey, a 
demographic form or a Social Identity Wheel. In 
these cases, I answered “agnostic” or, more often, 
“non-religious” and moved on to the next ques-
tion. Religion simply did not feel like a part of my 
life — at least, not anymore — and nothing about 
my lack of a label seemed complicated until this 
summer.

***
In late May of this year, a mass grave containing 

the remains of 215 Indigenous children was found 
on the former grounds of the Kamloops Indian 
Residential School in British Columbia, Canada. 
The school was part of an extensive residential 
school system sponsored by the Canadian gov-
ernment and administered by churches. Under 
the guise of providing an education to Indigenous 
children, Canada’s residential school system sys-
tematically stole Indigenous children from their 
families to remove them from their culture, strip 
them of their heritage and force them to assimilate 
to the white culture of Euro-Canadian colonizers. 
This effort is described as a “cultural genocide” 
by Canada’s Truth and Reconciliation Commis-
sion. The still-unknown number of Indigenous 

children that died in residential schools, and the 
disrespect with which their deaths were treated, 
demonstrates that the Canadian government’s 
effort to destroy Indigenous culture would be car-
ried out no matter the cost, including the destruc-
tion of Indigenous lives.

At the schools, children were forbidden from 

speaking their own languages or acknowledg-
ing their heritage. They were given Anglo names 
and many were baptized against their families’ 
wishes. Their hair was cut short and they were 
dressed in Western-style uniforms. Many didn’t 
receive an education, either — the curriculum was 
focused on prayer, along with manual and domes-
tic labor.

Along with the inherent cruelty of forcibly 

separating children from their family and culture, 
conditions at the residential schools were hor-
rific. The “schools” were places of severe physi-
cal, psychological and sexual abuse. Tuberculosis 
was rampant, and Indigenous children in these 
schools died of the disease at a much higher rate 
than children in the general Canadian population. 
Conditions that contribute to the development 
and spread of tuberculosis, such as “malnutri-
tion, overcrowding and poor ventilation” were 
common in the schools. As early as 1907, the chief 
medical officer of Canada’s Department of Indian 
Affairs noted this problem and urged the federal 
government to improve conditions and to have 
tuberculosis nurses on staff. He was not only 
ignored but also prevented from conducting fur-
ther research and sharing his findings. Two pres-
ent-day tuberculosis experts, looking back, believe 
the devastating impact of the disease in residential 
schools was not an accident, but rather the “result 
of deliberate neglect and mistreatment.”

Kamloops was affiliated with the Catholic 

Church until 1969 when the federal government 
took over operations, using it as a residence for a 
day school until its closing in 1978. It was only one 
of 139 facilities identified within the residential 
school system, which an estimated 150,000 Indig-

enous children were forced to attend. And yet the 
tragedy of the residential schools is not reserved to 
the distant past — the last residential school closed 
in 1996, only 25 years ago.

The discovery of the mass grave at Kamloops 

spurred calls for further investigation, and since 
late May, more than 1,000 unmarked graves of 
Indigenous children have been found in British 
Columbia and Saskatchewan. Many of the former 
sites at which these tragedies are being uncovered 
were affiliated with the Catholic Church.

To be clear, the Catholic Church was not the 

only religious organization affiliated with these 
schools — the Anglican, Methodist and Presbyte-
rian churches also oversaw the operation of schools 

within the system. But the 
Catholic Church was the 
one whose schools were 
associated with recent 
findings 
of 
unmarked 

graves, and therefore was 
the focus of scrutiny this 
summer. In the wake of 
this discovery, 68 Catho-
lic churches across Can-
ada were subsequently 
vandalized or burned in 
“suspicious” fires, some 
of 
which 
completely 

destroyed the churches. 
While no suspects or 
official 
motives 
have 

been identified, the burn-
ings seemed to be an act 
of protest. Additionally, 
statues of Queen Victoria 
(the leader of the British 

Empire from 1837 to 1901, during which the Cana-
dian Confederation was founded) and Queen Eliz-
abeth II (Canada’s current head of state, a reminder 
of their colonialist past) were toppled as part of pro-
tests on Canada Day.

The vandalism was met with criticism from 

some, including from Prime Minister Justin 
Trudeau — who happens to be Catholic. He 
claimed that while he understood the anger, these 
acts were “actually depriving people who are in 
need of grieving and healing and mourning from 
places where they can grieve and reflect and look 
for support.” Brian Pallister, then the premier of 
Manitoba, also “strongly condemn(ed) acts of 
violence and vandalism,” calling it a “major set-
back” and urging Canadians to “come together” 
to advance “real reconciliation.”

The response among Indigenous leaders in 

Canada was more ambivalent. Arlen Dumas, 
grand chief of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, 
expressed shock at the vandalism and said he 
“personally wouldn’t have participated.” But he 
also shared that the discovery of the unmarked 
graves had been “very triggering” and the events 
were a symbol of hurt, frustration and anger. 
Greg Gabriel, chief of the Penticton Indian Band, 
said his community had “mixed feelings” about 
the burning of Sacred Heart Church on their 

land; while the memory of the Roman Catholic 
Church’s subjugation was painful, the church 
had also become an integral part of their com-
munity. Chief Clarence Louie of the Osoyoos 
Indian Band expressed similar ambivalence about 
Sacred Heart Church, saying that while he doesn’t 
believe in the Catholic church, “some of (his) peo-
ple do.” Other Indigenous leaders said the church 
burnings were “not in solidarity” with Indigenous 
peoples, worsening the strife of those in mourn-
ing and furthering the divide between Indigenous 
and non-Indigenous people.

While vandalism may not have been the most 

productive response, the burnings demonstrate 
the visceral anger and hurt that the Catholic 
Church created through its role in the residential 
schools. These feelings are only exacerbated by 
the Church’s response to its past wrongdoings. 
The Church, along with the federal government, 
has resisted sharing the records that would, 
among other things, help identify the remains 
within the uncovered graves. Pope Francis has yet 
to explicitly apologize for the Catholic Church’s 
part in this cultural genocide. The Canadian Con-
ference of Catholic Bishops did recently issue an 
official apology for their role in the residential 
school system, after years of refusal to do so.

But this isn’t nearly enough. 
When the Church resists taking full account-

ability or working cooperatively with reconcili-
ation efforts, property destruction directed at a 
destructive organization may feel like the only 
outlet. It should be mentioned that, though there 
were concerns that church burnings could add to 
already significant wildfire risk, there is no evi-
dence that anyone was killed or severely injured 
by the burnings, only that property was damaged. 
Yet some responses to the burnings seemed more 
concerned with the hypothetical lives that could 
have been lost than the Indigenous lives that were.

To be clear, Indigenous voices should have 

been prioritized in the responses to these tragic 
discoveries. While the vandalism may have gen-
erated mixed feelings for Indigenous communi-
ties, the condemnation of the church burnings on 
behalf of Indigenous leaders was clear, and their 
calls to end the violence and the further damage it 
was inflicting upon their communities should’ve 
been heeded immediately. But the destructive 
protests demonstrated that the discoveries of 
unmarked graves created anger, and perhaps felt 
personal, even to non-Indigenous people.

I am not Indigenous, nor even Canadian. But 

the events of this summer created an anger that 
felt personal for me as well. Of course, it reminded 
me that boarding schools analogous to Canada’s 
residential schools were operated in the United 
States — including three in Michigan and 16 in 
my home state of Minnesota — with the objective, 
summarized by Captain Richard H. Pratt, to “kill 
the Indian ... save the man.” But the events of this 
summer also made salient an aspect of my identity 
I hadn’t thought about in years.

If we are what we eat, we’re a generation of 

chicken nuggets. I grew up eating fun finger food 
as an after-school snack and an easy dinner, some-
times in the shape of dinosaurs and Disney char-
acters. Nuggets please even the pickiest of eaters 
(case in point: this teenager who ate chicken nug-
gets for 15 years and practically nothing else) and 
take just minutes to prepare. As an adult, I pass 
on meat for environmental reasons but I join a 
growing number of nugget-inclined consumers 
opting for meatless alternatives. We’ve created a 
demand, and top companies are battling tooth and 
nail to be our supply. With release after release of 
new imitation chicken, fall 2021 is shaping up to be 
the golden age of imitation chicken nuggets. What 
a time to be alive. 

What happens when you take chicken nuggets, 

an obscenely processed food to begin with, and 
remove the only recognizable ingredient? The 
vegan form emerges out of the shadows, a mystery 
meat sans meat … so, just a mystery. They’re not 
just fried tofu. Depending on the brand, they’re a 
concoction of protein isolate, soy protein concen-
trate, textured vegetable protein, wheat gluten 
and preservatives no one’s great-grandma would 
recognize. Chickenless chicken is a slew of para-
doxes: both earthy and artificial, highly processed 
yet classified as a healthy alternative, plant-based 
but without any recognizable plants (clearly made 
inside a plant, though). They taste eerily similar to 
the real thing, a pinnacle of food science. 

Vegan chicken nuggets also play into a nugget-

obsessed culture, for they are more than just a 
food. A generation of young people uses “chicken 
nugget” as a term of endearment and paste slo-
gans like “nugs not drugs” and “nug life” on water 
bottles and laptops. Such phrases not only signal 
an affinity for breaded chicken but also a know-
ing lameness, a message that the nugget-lover is 
down-to-earth and easy to please. 

“Even though I look like a burnt chicken nug-

get, I still love myself,” said a little kid in a 2016 
Vine.

“Chicken nuggets is like my family,” says 

another kid in another viral video, before eating 
the breaded poultry for breakfast. 

The most retweeted tweet in English is a 

17-year-old’s attempt to win free chicken nuggets 
from Wendy’s.

One of RedBubble’s chicken nugget products is 

a shirt that says “Chicky Nuggies” above an image 
of Yoda eating nuggets. There’s a sticker that says 
“26.2 (chicken nuggets eaten)” and others that 

read “Netflix and chicken nuggets.” Chicken nug-
gets have transcended sustenance and entered the 
realm of cultural obsession — similar to Trader 
Joe’s and wine, two other consumables with great 
PR. Buying nuggets brings back memories of 
childhood family dinners and play date snacks, of 
simpler times and simpler cuisines. You don’t need 
the chicken itself to get the same nostalgic expe-
rience. Like alcohol-free wine (which is surging 
in popularity), chickenless chicken is about more 
than taste: It’s about participating in culture. The 
deep-fried, faux-poultry confections, despite their 
obscure ingredients, fill a need—a cultural soft 
spot and a growing market share. 

The fake chicken wars
Fake nuggets fill my freezer. Right now, my 

roommates and I have four different brands, each 
packed in earthy green tones and labeled with law-
suit-skirting phrases like “chickenless strips” and 
“chik’n.” One brand is Boca, a stalwart vegetarian 
brand started in the late 70s (now owned by Kraft 
Heinz) that boasts “the original chick’n veggie nug-
get.” I find that their nuggets are quite similar to 
Morning Star Farm’s (owned by the Kellog Com-
pany), another decades-old company: powdery 
breading and not too greasy. In contrast, the nug-
gets from Raised and Rooted (owned by Tyson 
Foods) are a greasy nostalgia trip to McDonald’s 
play places; they waft umami flavors through the 
house and pack a deliciously huge caloric punch. 
We’ve also bought Earth Grown, Gardein, Trader 
Joe’s and Whole Foods brands. Lightlife has new 
tenders and filets, MorningStar has Incogmeato 
Chik’n, and Nestle is investing in fake meat too.

It’s a packed market, but two booming rivals 

hog a lot of recent press: Impossible and Beyond 
Meat. Like Coke and Pepsi, the Whopper and 
the Big Mac, Starbucks and Dunkin’, the big-
gest difference between the two powerhouses is 
the branding, not the products. This year, both 
Impossible and Beyond have branched out from 
fake beef and taken a highly publicized stab at rec-
reating chicken. 

The fake meat giants, which boast millions in 

seed funding, are focused on converting meat-
eaters. This month, Impossible came out with 
new vegan nuggets, and rival startup Beyond 
Meat is coming to the freezer aisle, too. After dis-
continuing its disappointing imitation chicken in 
2019, Beyond is trying again. Its fava-bean-based 
tenders, which have been at restaurants since July, 
are coming to grocery stores like Walmart as soon 
as October.

Standing beside the big rivals is the cool kid of 

fake meat startups, Simulate (formerly Nuggs), 
which is led by a 22-year-old from Australia 
named Ben Pasternak. The company is a media 
darling, and its branding is unconventional — 
unlike the earthy hues of other brands, Simulate 
is less “veggie” and more “edgy.” In a recent post, 
the brand’s official Instagram account parodied 
social justice slideshows with an absurdist story 
about Iceland. It starts with “What’s going on in 
Iceland right now and how you can help” and 
proceeds to describe a narrator’s “friend Jared” 
who said the narrator had “’mice hands,’ which 
is just so rude of him, because he knows I’m so 
sensitive about my small hands.” Later, the post 
shows a drawing of the narrator’s hand with a 
Nugg for scale. It didn’t make any sense at all, yet 
that was the point. 

Steeped in up-to-the-minute meme culture, 

and a whopping $44.99 for a pack of one hundred, 
the brand positions itself as the “Tesla of chicken 
nuggets.”

Where’s the beef? 
Vegetarians aren’t hippies anymore. Peeking 

behind the opaque walls of the meat industry can 
radicalize even the devout carnivore, and younger 
generations care more about the environmental 
impacts of what they consume. As observed in the 
rise of alternative milks, a climate-minded culture 
now invites vegan products — intentionally vegan 
products — out of health food aisles and onto end 
caps and advertisements: grocery’s prime real 
estate. 

At 15, I abruptly stopped meat after watching 

“Cowspiracy,” a documentary that unveiled the 
pernicious climate effects of the livestock indus-
try. Some of its facts and tactics were misleading, 
but its message holds up: Eating large quantities 
of meat is unsustainable. A 2018 study published 
in the journal Science found that while meat and 
dairy provide 18% of calories and 37% of the pro-
tein in our diets, they use 83% of farmland and 
produce 60% of agriculture’s greenhouse gas 
emissions. Those statistics have permanently 
changed the contents of my plate. 

Now, I am not only proud to have a climate-

conscious diet, but I am grateful that it’s easily 
attainable. It’s rare that I find a restaurant without 
a meatless option, and even fast-food giants are 
eschewing meaty menus at an astonishing rate. 
Passing on meat feels rather normal, not alterna-
tive. More than any time in recent history, the 
world caters to vegetarians. 

Why can’t the chicken cross the road? It’s too 

fat to walk

Imitation chicken is having a moment half a 

century after processed chicken itself captivated 
the world. 

If capitalism grows like a tree, the chicken nug-

get is its fruit: born out of an oversupply of poultry 
in the 50s and 60s, it took your grandma’s chicken 
dinner and returned something deboned, bat-
tered, deep-fried and packaged. Marketing efforts 
promoted a notion that true leisure wasn’t cook-
ing but consumption and nuggets allowed home 
cooks to sit back and relax. The work you once 
endured to prepare dinner had instead been done 
by an amorphous supply chain. The chicken nug-
get is, if nothing else, easy to prepare. 

Decades later, humans have a $66-billion-a-

year chicken habit. We’ve slashed their growing 
time to a third of what it once was and have bred 
birds that are nearly three times as large as birds 
a century ago. The chicken is the world’s most 
popular bird.

The chicken nugget’s ingredients, though ques-

tionable, don’t seem to phase people. Pink slime 
panic blew over, the headlines about lighter fluid 
in chicken dwindled away and the unpronounce-
able petroleum and corn derivatives weren’t 
enough to deter everyone. Celebrity chef Jamie 
Oliver showed a group of elementary schoolers 
how chicken nuggets are made, and though they 
let out groans of disgust at the liquified carcass 
and skin, they had no qualms about putting the 
finished product in their mouth. 

“Anyone want one of these?” he asked after 

his stomach-churning demonstration. When the 
kids proceeded to raise their hands and lunge at 
the plate, the camera panned to the chef’s disap-
pointed expression. 

Just like the traditional chicken nugget’s ability 

to transcend the bad press, fake chicken nuggets 
haven’t been phased by criticism of their ingredi-
ents or carbon footprint. Despite being ultra-pro-
cessed and packaged in plastic, a nugget forged out 
of soy may still seem greener than the real thing. 

Little research has evaluated the climate 

impacts of fake chicken, but there are studies 
about promising impacts of fake beef. A 2018 
report commissioned by Beyond Meat and con-
ducted by the Center for Sustainable Systems at 
the University of Michigan compared Beyond 
Meat burger with beef.
