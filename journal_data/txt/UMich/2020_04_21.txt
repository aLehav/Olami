Third-year 
Medical 
student 

Paris Rollins was in the middle 

of clinical rotations at Henry 

Ford Hospital, working 9-hour 

shifts in the Emergency Medicine 

Department, when she found out 

that the University of Michigan’s 

Medical School would be pulling 

all students out of rotations.

“I felt this dread in the pit 

of my stomach,” Rollins said. 

“(The 
announcement) 
felt 

unprecedented 
in 
what 
could 

happen next.”

Two 
days 
after 
the 

announcement, 
Rollins’ 

classmates were already looking 

for ways to get involved with the 

response to fight COVID-19. She 

received an email detailing that 

the Detroit Health Department 

would be rolling out massive 

numbers of tests through a drive-

thru at the State Fairgrounds and 

would need volunteers to call 

patients with their test results. 

“Medical students don’t like 

to be idle for very long,” Rollins 

joked. “It seemed like an awesome 

opportunity to speak with people 

when they are getting this big 

relief, 
or 
potentially 
stressful 

news and I thought that is how I 

want to be able to help people.”

Though Rollins had learned 

how to deliver bad news to patients 

in medical school, giving people 

their results was a difficult task.

Despite transitioning to online learning, campus 
organizations carry on with end-of-year projects

Virtual platforms provide space for members to hold groups meetings, plan events, execute goals

“Was supposed to” seems to have 

become one of the most commonly 

used phrases of this semester. 

The 
Prison 
Creative 
Arts 

Project was supposed to put on 

an exhibition of prisoner art from 

mid-March to early April. Shift, 

a creator space for University of 

Michigan students, was supposed 

to have a project showcase. The 

Michigan Journal of International 

Affairs was supposed to print and 

distribute their journal.

Yet in spite of a global pandemic 

and unprecedented changes to 

daily life, all three of these student 

organizations, along with other 

groups across campus, found ways 

to modify their plans to finish out 

the semester. 

PCAP Interim Director Nora 

Krinitsky oversees all of PCAP’s 

programs, which include weekly 

creative 
art 
workshops 
inside 

prisons and the final performances 

put on by those workshops, which 

range from theater performances 

to literary reviews. 

In early March, the Michigan 

Department 
of 
Corrections 

suspended all in-person volunteer 

programs. This meant the end of 

weekly workshops and forced the 

cancellation of PCAP’s annual art 

exhibition. According to Krinitsky, 

this exhibition is the largest 

curated show of prisoner art in the 

world.

Until they are able to host the 

live exhibition, PCAP created an 

online preview of the art show, 

where people can view some of the 

art slated to be in the exhibition 

and leave feedback for the artists.

“We felt that creating an online 

preview 
would 
enable 
us 
to 

fulfill our mission of community 

outreach and prisoner support and 

engagement, even though we can’t 

do our normal programming right 

now,” Krinitsky said.

Mark 
Schlissel, 
president 

of the University of Michigan, 

released a statement regarding 

the 
University’s 
financial 

situation. According to Schlissel, 

the University is expected to 

lose between $400 million and 

$1 billion due to the COVID-19 

pandemic. 

The 
University 
is 
taking 

immediate action to this expected 

loss in revenue by restricting pay in 

nonessential University business. 

These financial restrictions apply 

to all three University campuses 

and Michigan Medicine. 

“We must work to preserve 

financial resources wherever we 

can,” Schlissel said. “Some of the 

actions below are amplifications 

of previously announced plans, or 

they draw a clearer line for how 

we will proceed in the coming 

months. These actions apply to 

all three campuses and Michigan 

Medicine.”

In response to the expected 

loss of revenue, the University is 

freezing new hires, faculty and 

staff salaries and reducing hours. 

The University is also going to 

begin 
implementing 
voluntary 

furlough programs for “regular 

staff in non-critical operations.” 

Research and employment critical 

to COVID-19 relief will continue 

to be funded by the University. 

University 
leaders 
are 
also 

cutting their own salaries, with 

Schlissel, U-M Flint Chancellor 

Debasish 
Dutta 
and 
U-M 

Dearborn Chancellor Domenico 

Grasso to receive a 10 percent pay 

cut to their monthly income. Other 

members of University leadership 

are cutting their salary by 5 

percent. 

Campus construction projects 

will 
also 
be 
discontinued. 

According to Schlissel, financial 

changes 
will 
determine 
the 

continuation of these projects in 

the future. 

University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitgerald told The Daily in an email 

they had no additional information 

and urged those interested to look 

at the University’s FAQ section 

about COVID-19 for more details 

on the University’s response.

Schlissel said the University 

may 
have 
to 
take 
additional 

measures in the future to secure 

the safety of its students, faculty 

and staff, but nothing is confirmed 

as of Monday.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

At a press conference Monday 

afternoon, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer 

announced the creation of a task 

force dedicated to addressing racial 

disparities in COVID-19 related 

deaths. 40 percent of reported 

coronavirus deaths in the state 

are Black residents, though Black 

people make up only 14 percent of 

the state’s total population. 

Whitmer said while statewide 

cases are decreasing and the curve 

of cases is flattening, numbers 

are rising in rural areas that were 

previously unaffected. She also 

announced 
increased 
testing 

capabilities throughout the state 

and a more robust contact tracing 

program that will alert residents 

when they have come into contact 

with someone who tested positive 

for COVID-19.

“Statewide, 
the 
number 
of 

patients who are in the hospital 

with a suspected or confirmed 

COVID-19 has declined from a 

high point about 10 days ago,” 

Whitmer said. “In fact, we have 

seen a 15 percent reduction in the 

last 10 days … Utilization remains 

high in some places but we do see 

some decreases emerging.”

Whitmer 
spoke 
alongside 

Joneigh Khaldun, chief medical 

executive 
and 
chief 
deputy 

director for health, and Lt. Gov. 

Garlin Gilchrist. She said the task 

force will consist of politicians 

and health care experts focusing 

specifically on coronavirus risks in 

communities of color. 

“They will recommend actions 

to 
increase 
transparency 
and 

reporting data regarding the racial 

and ethnic impact of COVID-19, 

removing barriers to accessing 

physical and mental health care, 

reduce the impact of medical bias 

in treatment and testing, mitigate 

environmental and infrastructure 

factors contributing to increased 

exposure 
during 
pandemics 

resulting in mortality and develop 

improved systems for supporting 

long-term economic recovery and 

physical and mental health care 

during a pandemic,” Whitmer said. 

Khaldun 
said 
medical 

professionals across the state must 

be conscious of these disparities in 

order to reduce bias and effectively 

serve areas with large numbers of 

cases. 

“We’ve 
talked 
about 
racial 

disparities in COVID-19 deaths 

that we are seeing across the state 

with African Americans being 

disproportionately 
impacted,” 

Khaldun said. “Today, I sent a 

letter to our medical community 

to make sure they are aware of 

these disparities and giving them 

the tools they need to be able to 

appropriately address them.”

Gilchrist, who will lead the task 

force, said the disproportionate 

impact 
of 
coronavirus 
in 

communities 
of 
color 
is 
the 

result of generations of systemic 

discrimination. As a result, he said 

the task force’s work will require 

them to think of systemic solutions 

that 
address 
both 
immediate 

health risks and deeper societal 

issues.

“Despite the progress that has 

been made for generations in 

terms of bending our arcs toward 

justice, we still have to respond to 

generations of racial disparities 

and inequity that have impacted 

communities of color across our 

state and across the country,” 

Gilchrist said. “Our administration 

has put in place several measures 

and pieces of infrastructure to try 

to address these disparities.”

These same disparities in the 

impact of the COVID-19 outbreak 

are present inWashtenaw County.

In an interview with The Daily 

earlier this month, Susan Ringler-

Cerniglia, 
communications 
and 

health promotion administrator 

at 
Washtenaw 
County 
Health 

Department, said the department 

is working to help vulnerable 

communities as the virus spreads, 

which they’ve done prior to the 

pandemic as well.

“This isn’t something that we 

see only with coronavirus. So 

it’s part of what we, as a public 

health department, are striving 

to do and improve all the time,” 

Ringler-Cerniglia said. “We have 

long-standing efforts to work with 

community members and with 

organizations to identify where 

we see these types of impacts and 

work to approve that to improve 

them.” 

At the press conference, Gilchrist 

said the task force’s work and 

state’s response to the pandemic 

will not only affect infection and 

mortality rates but also the ways 

in which individuals interact with 

one another in times of crisis. 

“Once we get to the other side of 

this, I think we’re going to be more 

mindful of how we treat and spend 

time with one another,” Gilchrist 

said. “We’re gonna call a little 

more often. We’re gonna say ‘I love 

you’ a little more forcefully. We’re 

gonna 
have 
more 
meaningful 

interactions 
and 
conversations. 

And that connection, that will be 

the legacy of this pandemic. How 

we came together, how we worked 

today, how we stayed together and 

how we stand tall for one another.”

 “So what we’re able to do is educate the public 

about creative arts that are happening inside 

prisons.”

In addition, students involved in PCAP 

organized correspondence to people who are 

incarcerated, among other forms of activism and 

engagement.

Executive 
board 
members 
for 
PCAP 

also created a mutual aid fund for formerly 

incarcerated people who are dealing with crises 

amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The fund has 

raised more than $14,000 and helped more than 

30 people so far. 

“It has been so successful and other students 

have been helping to fundraise for that effort to 

get the word out about it,” Krinitsky said. “It’s just 

been a really, really positive outcome.”

LSA senior Hannah Agnew served as president 

of PCAP’s student executive committee this year. 

According to Agnew, it was difficult for her and 

other students in the organization to find out they 

could no longer run the in-person workshops.

“The point of it is bringing joy into very difficult 

and dehumanizing spaces,” Agnew said. “It’s 

definitely a struggle of feeling really helpless about 

what we can do as a student org and knowing that 

we just have to sit back while a lot of the suffering 

is happening.”

Agnew worked to advance the organization’s 

mission by trying to help improve conditions 

for incarcerated people, who are at high risk of 

contracting COVID-19.

“The goals have shifted from finding support 

for our membership more so to finding support 

for the folks that we would usually be facilitating 

with inside,” Agnew said. “Right now, because 

we can’t engage in the community, (the goal) has 

really changed to how can we spread awareness 

about this issue? How can we find ways of rallying 

folks around the release of certain incarcerated 

populations during this difficult time?”

For smaller groups that are more focused on 

the campus involvement, such as Shift, having 

regularly scheduled meetings throughout the 

semester played a big role in maintaining a sense 

of community. 

According to co-director of Shift Julia 

Averbuch, Business and Engineering freshman, 

the group has about 40 students involved. The 

organization also has a house where the members 

would gather for meetings and where projects 

from past members are on display.

“It has a really homey environment,” Averbuch 

said. “Losing that was a big deal to a lot of our 

members because it was such a space a lot of 

people felt like was a second home to them.”

To try and maintain that environment, the 

group shifted to hosting weekly virtual meetings, 

where members could discuss their personal 

projects. In addition, members created a website 

to virtually display their projects, since they could 

no longer host their regular end of year showcase.

“We thought having something static, that 

stays as similar as it could to pre-COVID, would be 

really beneficial for the organization,” Averbuch 

said. “That way, not everything’s changed. Seniors 

aren’t missing out on the last couple months of 

their experience with this organization and new 

members are getting the full experience as well.”

The MJIA, which holds weekly meetings, 

has now moved to online communications to 

complete the process of editing their journal, 

which typically publishes once a semester. 

According to Public Policy senior Brooke 

Bacigal, who is editor in chief of the publication, 

the group was still able to get a majority of their 

editing process done in-person during the first 

half of the semester. However, rather than printing 

about 1,000 copies of the journal to distribute, 

as they usually do, they are running the entire 

publication online, printing only a few copies for 

writers of the journal. 

“Fortunately, there are a lot of collaborative 

ways that you can edit remotely,” Bacigal 

said. “(It’s) a very exciting process that’s super 

dependent upon feedback and engagement, which 

was difficult to be able to transpose to online work 

… but through Google Forms, videos, recorded 

videos and chat options through Slack, we’ve been 

able to keep up communication and engagement 

with our staff writers and allow for that tutorial 

process to continue.”

Since a majority of their funds go towards the 

printing of the journal, according to Bacigal, the 

general membership unanimously voted to have 

that funding allocated to COVID-19 relief. 

“We were able to buy, I think, close to 1,000 

masks and donate to a fund that is going directly 

to Detroit-based hospitals for personal protection 

equipment,” Bacigal said. 

While Bacigal said it was disappointing not 

to be able to print and distribute the journal 

around campus, she felt that current events have 

reinforced the need for the journal.

“The 
entire 
circumstances 
surrounding 

COVID-19 have really pushed the reason why 

we have this journal, in a lot of ways,” Bacigal 

said. “It’s giving an additional challenge, but still 

allowing people to share their voice.”

“In the months ahead, we may have to 

take additional measures to address growing 

consequences of the pandemic,” Schlissel 

said. “For instance, work that is available 

now under the current conditions may not be 

available in future months. We also must keep 

in mind the operational and resource needs 

when we are able to ramp back up. This will 

depend on state orders and federal guidelines, 

and it’s important to note that it won’t be like 

flipping a switch.”

Earlier this month, U.S. Rep. Debbie 

Dingell, D-Mich., announced the University’s 

Ann Arbor campus would receive a total of 

$25,244,052 in emergency grants to cover 

“significant” financial losses due to the 

COVID-19 outbreak. Of that, a minimum of 

$12,622,026 will be allocated for emergency 

financial 
aid 
grants 
to 
students. 
The 

University of Michigan-Dearborn will receive 

$6,989,129, with minimum of $3,494,565 

going toward emergency financial aid grants 

to students.

While the status of in-person classes 

resuming in the fall semester is still unknown, 

talk of canceling on-campus instruction has 

become more frequent among university 

administrators as coronavirus infections 

grow. Schlissel noted in his email that there 

are no clear answers on the status of fall 

classes, but he hopes in-person courses will 

be able to resume.

“We’re already working to plan for a more 

gradual return to normal activity, informed 

by strong public health guidance,” Schlissel 

wrote. “I remain cautiously optimistic that we 

will be able to deliver a public health-informed 

Fall semester on our three campuses.”

Daily Staff Reporter Jasmin Lee can be 

reached at itsshlee@umich.edu

“The first few might be positive, then the next 

ones are negative,” Rollins said. “It’s really hard 

to switch emotions … these calls only last five 

minutes, so to connect with them in that time was 

definitely a challenge.”

Third-year Medical student Majd Mokbel also 

volunteers at the Detroit Health Department and 

makes some of the 800 outgoing calls informing 

people of their test results every day.

“People have a varied range of emotions 

when they’re told their results — excited, happy, 

relieved with the negative results and acceptance 

and being scared with the positive,” he said. “But 

pretty surprisingly, many people we have talked 

to have been brave about their results.”

Second-year 
Medical 
student 
Rebecca 

Goldberg, who was rotating around Henry 

Ford Hospital, has also found a way to support 

the hospital’s response to COVID-19 remotely. 

Goldberg is a lead on the patient outreach 

initiative, which involves calling Ypsilanti Health 

Center patients who are not currently enrolled 

in the online health portal and helping them 

navigate the system to access video visits online.

“For me, it was kind of a no-brainer (to help 

out),” Goldberg said. “To be able to help patients 

in trying times like these, that’s how I’d rather 

spend my time any day.”

Third-year Medical student Tom Hester was 

rotating with Dr. Theodore Iwashyna in the 

Veterans’ Affairs Center when Iwashyna realized 

that a shortage of staff to care for patients would 

become a large issue. This led to the conception of 

the role of a Respiratory Therapist Extender. 

Hester and a team of four other classmates 

have been trained to provide basic respiratory 

care like patient assessments, oxygen rounds and 

restocking equipment so that the therapists can 

focus their efforts on patients on ventilators.

“Our job is to alleviate the workload of the 

respiratory therapists, so they can focus on 

treating the critically ill,” Hester said. 

The plan moving forward is to share the 

concept with other institutions in an effort to 

crowdsource continued improvements to the 

program. 

Quintin Solano, a member of student council 

and second-year Medical student, had been 

working the Pediatrics rotation at Michigan 

Medicine from 6 a.m. to 4 p.m. and had seen the 

respiratory ICU being set up in the weeks leading 

up to the pandemic. After a discussion with 

the Student Council President Ali Hammoud, 

he realized the shortage of personal protective 

equipment had to be addressed.

“I like the idea of being able to help our 

colleagues who are going to be on the frontline, 

and help give out the equipment that they need,” 

Solano said.

After seeing Michigan Medicine’s social 

media push for personal protective equipment 

donations, Solano and a number of his fellow 

classmates began volunteering to help count, 

inventory and repackage the donations in a way 

that would allow the hospital to actually use the 

supplies.

“Donations were just flooding in from hospital 

laboratories, 
University 
laboratories, 
local 

businesses, hair salons, nail salons,” Solano said. 

“(As medical students) our hope is, you know, to 

be in the clinical environment, but if we can’t, 

then we’re gonna do everything we can outside of 

it to help everybody (in) there.”

In addition to his presidency of the Student 

Council, Hammoud is also co-director of the 

M-Response Corps, a medical student-led 

initiative to fight the COVID-19 crisis. From 

providing remote prenatal care to delivering 

groceries, students have found a multitude of 

ways to contribute. Hammoud said he sees this 

time as an opportunity to get as many students 

involved without coercion.

“We put together a survey that we sent out to 

all students before students were sent out. We just 

got so many students who are like, please don’t 

make us leave (to go home). We want to serve. We 

want to help,” Hammoud said.

Hester said he was inspired to see how his 

fellow classmates mobilized to support the health 

care system during this state of emergency.

“There are so many ways to help with the 

pandemic response that doesn’t involve patient 

care, (and) those ways are just as important,” 

Hester said.

Political campaigns balance policy, fundraising

Politicians up for re-election must decide whether to focus on outreach or legislation in the time of COVID-19

During the COVID-19 crisis, the state and 

national governments have been attempting to 

work together to provide medical supplies and 

implement shelter-in-place guidelines to slow 

the spread of the virus. Yet with the general 

election less than 200 days away and the 12th 

Congressional District primary only 106 days 

away, the congressional campaigns in the 

state of Michigan are faced with the difficult 

decision of whether to start fundraising or to 

stay focused on the coronavirus pandemic.

Campaigns have had to get creative during 

the pandemic as they move online. With 

door-to-door organizing out of the question 

and gala fundraisers unable to take place, the 

question becomes: How do candidates bring in 

donations?

In March, U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, 

D-Mich., who is facing a primary opponent in 

August, told The Daily campaigning was not 

her priority and her primary focus continues 

to be on serving Ann Arbor residents during 

the pandemic. While speaking with The Daily 

on Wednesday, she said she is still committed 

to serving and communicating with her 

constituency. 

“I am not focused on fundraising right now. 

I think we need to be focused on killing this 

virus once and for all,” Dingell said. “I’m trying 

to make sure (constituents) know about the 

issues, that we’re educating them. Reaching 

out to people. Getting people that I work with 

to do neighbor checks, to check on people in 

their community, to reach out to seniors that 

feel alone.”

Dingell acknowledged that she will need to 

get back on the campaign trail.

“At some point, I’ll have to start to campaign 

again because the primary is in August,” Dingell 

said. “But I have not felt it was appropriate or 

the right thing to do and therefore, I’m not. I 

will at some point, but I won’t right now.”

Solomon Rajput, the 27-year-old medical 

student who is challenging Dingell in the 

Democratic primaries in August, has moved 

his entire campaign online. He said it’s a 

challenging time to fundraise when the U.S. 

is experiencing a surge in unemployment and 

the economy is headed toward a recession. In 

order to keep his grassroots campaign afloat, 

the millennial progressive has taken to social 

media for fundraising. 

“We are on our Twitter, Instagram and 

Facebook regularly,” Rajput said. “We’ve been 

making fundraising ads over social media and 

posting on them just making really small, small 

dollar ads, like $5.”

Additionally, using these social platforms, 

the Rajput campaign also contacts people 

individually by sending them direct messages 

explaining his campaign platform and sending 

them a link to donate to the campaign.

W

hile 
many 
parts 

of the world are 

now 
experiencing 

emotional 
darkness 
and 

instability, 
Israeli 
occupied 

territory is uniquely vulnerable 

to a coronavirus outbreak. With 

only four hours of electricity 

available each day, the lights have 

been out in Gaza for 13 years. In 

2007, Israel and Egypt imposed 

a land, air and sea blockade of 

the Gaza Strip after Hamas 

took control of the territory, 

leaving 
Gaza’s 
approximately 

two million residents isolated 

from the rest of the world. The 

economic and social realities on 

the other side of the blockade have 

dangerous 
implications. 
More 

than 70 percent of Gazans receive 

humanitarian aid and 50 percent 

are unemployed. These statistics, 

coupled 
with 
poor 
health 

infrastructure, leave Gazans ill-

equipped to tend to the economic 

and public health consequences 

that are sure to ensue.

The first two recommendations 

from 
the 
World 
Health 

Organization regarding protective 

measures against the coronavirus 

are to wash hands frequently and 

to maintain social distancing. 

These 
recommendations 
have 

been a nuisance to all, but have 

highlighted long-standing social 

inequity for many marginalized 

communities. In Gaza, social 

distancing and hand washing may 

be some of the least accessible 

practices for residents. Less than 4 

percent of freshwater is drinkable 

and with a population of two 

million people living in a territory 

the size of Detroit, Gaza is the 

third most densely populated 

polity in the world, making it ripe 

for an outbreak.

In the wake of a global 

pandemic, it is important to 

recognize the parallels these new 

circumstances present in relation 

to pre-pandemic living for so 

many Gazans. While the wealthy 

have access to savings and health 

care, unemployment and steep 

medical care costs can be just as 

deadly as the coronavirus for the 

working class. This pandemic 

is disproportionately impacting 

underprivileged groups — and 

that’s why anyone who’s been 

monitoring 
the 
situation 
of 

Palestinians in Gaza and the West 

Bank has cause for concern.

Leaders in the Palestinian 

Authority 
have 
claimed 
that 

Israeli police purposely dropped 

off a Palestinian worker showing 

symptoms 
of 
coronavirus 

at 
a 
checkpoint, 
instead 
of 

treating them, as agreed upon. 

Furthermore, Palestinians have 

accused Israeli Defense Forces 

soldiers of spitting on them to 

infect them with the virus. There 

have also been reports of increased 

violence among settlers in the 

West Bank against Palestinians.

While Israel has succeeded in 

slowing the spread of COVID-19 

thus far, existing Israeli policies 

in the West Bank and Gaza will 

have a disastrous effect once the 

virus inevitably spreads. The 

Israeli blockade of Gaza continues 

to undermine living and economic 

conditions, which make the spread 

of coronavirus — and human 

suffering — all the more likely. For 

instance, due to the blockade and 

frequent conflicts with Israel, as 

of April 6, there were only 70 ICU 

beds for all of Gaza. Simply put, 

Gaza does not have the health 

infrastructure or supplies to deal 

with this crisis alone.

With 
the 
virus 
quickly 

spreading, it is imperative for 

authorities to take action now. As a 

longtime ally of Israel, the United 

States is in a position to exert 

some amount of influence over 

the situation. Last year, Congress 

voted to send $75 million in aid to 

Palestinians living in the occupied 

territories of Gaza and the West 

Bank. 
However, 
the 
Trump 

administration has blocked that 

aid from being delivered at a 

time when it is most needed. The 

Trump administration recently 

announced it will give $5 million 

in humanitarian assistance to 

hospitals in the West Bank. This 

is an encouraging step in the 

right direction, but it’s not nearly 

enough. Five million dollars is 

a drop in the bucket and Gaza 

continues to receive no aid from 

the U.S. despite its severe shortage 

of medical supplies.

There are other actions that 

Israel can take to combat the 

spread of the virus in Gaza 

and the West Bank. The blockade 

restricting the passage of goods 

and people into Gaza will make 

it difficult for residents to access 

much-needed medical supplies 

and personnel. For years, the 

United Nations has called the 

blockade a “denial of basic human 

rights.” Now, more than ever, Israel 

must allow Palestinians access to 

basic medical necessities. Human 

rights watchdogs — including the 

UN and Human Rights Watch 

— have also condemned Israel in 

the past for detaining thousands 

of Palestinians without access to 

legal representation, health care 

or proper sanitation. Now, those 

detainees 
pose 
an 
enormous 

health risk and must be released 

from 
detention. 
Additionally, 

Israel must address the immense 

shortage of COVID-19 test kits 

available in occupied territory.

The U.S. is not without power. 

The 
unconditional 
military 

assistance which the U.S. gives to 

Israel helps fund the continued 

occupation and oppression of 

Palestinians. 
The 
U.S. 
must 

demand 
that 
Israel 
address 

the oncoming health crisis in 

occupied territory and put an 

end to its long record of human 

rights abuses. Attaching these 

conditions to U.S. military aid, 

along with releasing the promised 

$75 million in humanitarian aid 

to Palestinians, are preliminary 

steps that our country can take to 

begin to address Israel’s human 

rights crisis. As the COVID-19 

pandemic rages on, it is of utmost 

importance that we demand our 

lawmakers move to the right side 

of history.

As Jewish people, we feel a 

shared responsibility to oppose 

the Israeli occupation and work 

toward 
a 
peaceful 
two-state 

solution to the Israeli-Palestinian 

conflict. In this frightening age of 

COVID-19, we share a heightened 

concern for Palestinians in Gaza 

and the West Bank with all who are 

concerned for the state of human 

rights in Israel. The three of us are 

members of J Street, an organization 

rooted in the American Jewish 

community and advocating against 

the occupation. You can sign the J 

Street petition to unfreeze aid to 

Palestinians at jstreet.org.

The funny thing is, oranges aren’t really 

even in season right now. Yet lately I can’t 

seem to get enough of them. My family has 

been buying sacks and sacks of oranges; I 

grab one every time I head out on a walk, the 

juice making my fingers freeze in the brisk 

Northeastern April air. Or I have one at 2 a.m., 

the orange residue working its way under my 

fingertips as I wonder why I’m still up. Or my 

sister drops one off for me when I wake up, 

the citrus bursting on my tongue, forming 

my first impression 

of the morning as I 

lie still neatly tucked 

beneath my sheets.

Oranges 
have 

always seemed like 

such a normal fruit 

to me. Orange juice 

is a staple in any 

diner and numerous 

households, 

and 
every 
shitty 

continental breakfast 

at a Marriott near 

the 
airport 
has 

some 
hardened 

oranges 
that 
you 

would need a knife 

to take apart. But 

really good oranges, 

truly 
sweet 
and 

never too soft, those 

seem 
new 
every 

time. Somehow, every orange I’ve eaten 

in quarantine seems like the perfect one. 

Reading a book of poetry in the sun, or 

listening to the midnight rain on my porch by 

candlelight, they are a taste that I can anchor 

these moments to.

Tastes have an ability to carry moments 

with them. Sometimes I ask myself, is this 

quarantine a time worth remembering? But 

these oranges allow me to contain the best 

memories of quarantine, the ones where I 

dropped whatever piles of online homework 

I was working on to pursue exactly what I 

felt like doing, accompanied by an orange. 

Oranges have the ability to save a moment. 

Their sweet citrus contains such sunniness 

within them that it’s almost impossible to 

feel sad while eating them; from the first 

fresh waft of their smell, spurting from the 

peel as it comes apart beneath my fingernails, 

the corners of my mouth start to lift. They 

uniquely recall the Floridian sun beneath 

which they emerge.

All my life, I’ve been someone who has 

taken pleasure in the little details of life, the 

extra strokes that seem especially added on. 

Admittedly, obsessing over the little things 

is not always good, sometimes making me 

overanxious. It has also been my saving grace 

in these times. I notice how the pulpy extracts 

of the orange make the sides of my fingers stick 

together with sweetness. An orange often 

doesn’t break into neat pieces; the papery skin 

splits easily, and you have to quickly shove it 

in your mouth to keep the juice from dripping 

onto your T-shirt. And yet, the slices they 

are created in make them the perfect fruit 

to share. So often, at the end of the night, my 

mother and I 

will split one 

as we lie back 

on the couch, 

pondering 

what 

quarantine 

still holds for 

us. What new 

challenges 

will make us 

weep 
from 

frustration? 

What 
new 

flower 
or 

sunny 
day 

or text from 

a friend will 

make 
us 

huff 
with 

unexpected 

laughter?

While 
I 

know this whole piece might read as some 

weird late night infomercial praising the 

virtues of The Orange (now just $1.25 a 

pound!), it’s really just a small thing that 

brings me flickers of contentment in these 

times. Quarantine leaves room for the small 

things. In place of the wild ecstasy of dancing 

at concerts, I fling myself around my room 

to angry music I listened to at 16 (and laugh 

in nervous embarrassment when a family 

member walks in on me). Instead of treating 

myself to Kosmos or Chela’s, I try my own 

hand at cooking (and bite back tears and long 

strings of expletives when the olive oil jumps 

out of the pan, burning my inattentive hand). 

Instead of spending these increasingly warm 

and sunny afternoons on long hikes with 

friends, I eat oranges and lie on the grass (and 

simply smile when I stain my sleeves with a 

clumsy peeling of the fruit). Yes, every day I 

continue to dream about what will be when 

quarantine ends. But in these instances I am 

peaceful, acknowledging that, regardless of 

quarantine, this is a good moment.

The simplicity of citrus

ROSE SOFIA KAMINSKI

A driver’s ed. instructor, a hair stylist, a 

magpie and a rock star meet in a haunted 

mansion during a Satanic ritual. This 

sounds like a bad joke, right? Wrong. It’s 

“Extra Ordinary.”

In “Extra Ordinary,” everyday people 

encounter the spirit world. There is no 

professional exorcist, no medium with a 

tortured psyche, no photon blaster-touting 

Ghostbusters. There’s just Rose. She’s a 

driver’s ed. instructor by day, spiritual 

advisor by night. Maeve Higgins’ (“The 

Rainbow Bridge Motel”) performance 

as Rose is astounding. She can fill a 

single scene with more laughs than most 

A-list stars and you’re bound to love her 

character 
from 

the start.

Rose is a bit 

out of practice 

exorcism-wise, 

though, because 

of a disastrous 

accident 
with 

her father, her 

old partner on 

the ghost beat. 

She’s pulled out 

of retirement by 

Martin, 
played 

by Barry Ward 

(“The 
Fall”), 

whose daughter 

may 
or 
may 

not have been 

selected 
for 
a 

Satanic sacrifice. 

This 
sounds 

like 
typical 

horror 
fare, 

but the story’s 

supernatural 

tropes 
are 

wrapped 
in 

deadpan comedy. 

During a Satanic prayer, Will Forte’s 

(“Booksmart”) 
Christian 
Winter, 
the 

aforementioned rock star, keeps getting 

interrupted by his wife talking about her 

Chinese food. 

The spirits are ordinary, too. They 

haunt recycling bins, potholes: even a 

toaster. Unlike most hauntings, though, 

these shades aren’t out to get anybody. 

They’re just souls who have lost their way. 

“Extra Ordinary” is more realistic than 

most horror movies, in a way. What’s a 

dead person more likely to do: spend years 

coming up with sinister ways to frighten 

people, or try their best to right wrongs, 

look after loved ones or just be plain petty?

“Extra Ordinary” is horror combined 

with realistic, utterly dry humor — 

“The 
Conjuring” 
meets 
“Curb 
Your 

Enthusiasm.” It shouldn’t work, but it 

does. The writing is stupendous, and 

always has a punchline or a plot twist up 

its sleeve, right up until the last line. When 

all is said and done, though, what will be 

remembered are these characters. It’s a 

shame when the credits roll, because you’ll 

wants to keep watching these people and 

their hilarious, ghost-filled lives. Higgens 

and Forte are scene stealers, and their 

absurd characters sing with authenticity, 

which makes their hijinks all the funnier. 

Usually, horror movies are only funny 

when they’re quite bad: think 2006’s “The 

Wicker 
Man,” 

the 
recent 

“Color 
Out 
of 

Space” or pretty 

much any time, 

come to think of 

it, that Nicholas 

Cage is involved. 

Not 
in 
this 

case, 
though. 

In 
“Extra 

Ordinary,” 
the 

two 
genres 

complement 

one 
another. 

The comedy is 

funnier 
when 

juxtaposed 

with terror, and 

the 
horror 
is 

scarier 
when 

it interrupts a 

comedic moment 

that 
lets 
your 

guard down. The 

movie 
is 
also 

unafraid to get 

brutal, 
which 

keeps 
things 

edgy and adds some insane, gore-filled 

slapstick.

“Extra Ordinary” seamlessly blends 

two of the best genres for escaping reality. 

Watching this movie is a great way to 

distract oneself from the terrifying, 

comedy-starved real world. If you don’t 

like horror movies, or thumb your nose 

at comedies, you should give this a try. 

There’s something in it for everyone. 

 There’s even a scene where Will Forte 

sings “Satan … Satannnnn,” while twirling 

around in a kimono and playing an organ. 

It’s fantastic.

and horror in ‘Ordinary’

While I know this 

whole piece might read 
as some weird late night 
infomercial praising the 
virtues of The Orange 

(now just $1.25 a pound!), 

it’s really just a small 
thing that brings me 
contentment in these 

times.


Tayarisha Poe’s debut feature film “Selah and 

the Spades” is an ancient, familiar story. It’s about 

legacy and vice. It’s about power — how you get it, 

how you keep it, how you lose it. It’s stylish and 

Shakespearean, featuring crime kingpins, bootleg 

rackets, snitches and plenty of stitches … but also 

prom, senior pranks and AP bio tests.

As it so happens, “Selah and the Spades” is a 

mob movie wearing the clothes of your standard 

high school drama. 

Set in Haldswell School for Boarding and Day 

Students — the sort of magical private school that 

only exists on TV — the titular character Selah 

Summers (Lovie Simone, “Share”) is queen bee, 

a matriarch of matriarchs. A straight-A student, 

the cheerleading captain, possessor of wicked 

style and, of course, the ice-blooded, iron-fisted 

leader of a drug-dealing racket, Selah’s got a lot on 

her plate in addition to the looming approach of 

graduation. 

As an expository narrator tells the audience at 

the beginning of the film, Selah’s drug ring, the 

Spades, peddles in “booze, pills, powders, fun,” 

but is just one among many factions that facilitate 

illicit activities for the Haldswell student body. 

The Sea provides cheating services, the Skins 

regulate gambling, the Bobbys throw parties and 

the Prefects act as middlemen with the school 

administration. If Selah doesn’t find a successor 

soon, her drug empire is wont to be absorbed by 

one of these competing factions, and her legacy 

hangs in the balance.

Remember, 
this 

is 
high 
school. 
It’s 

Shakespearean, 
but 

weirdly Shakespearen, 

like 
“Bring 
It 
On” 

meets 
“Macbeth” 

meets “The Godfather” 

meets an angstier Wes 

Anderson. It’s not like 

HBO’s “Euphoria,” a 

show 
that 
similarly 

tried 
to 
represent 

the underbelly of the 

American teen’s life, complete with an unblinking 

vision of drug-addled and sex-infused strife 

and recklessness. No, it’s an altogether different 

brand, one that’s engorged with self-seriousness 

and overdramatic to an almost laughable degree. 

Cliques have mottos and sign actual, written 

treaties with one another. Posters on the wall 

scream “FACTIONS are GANGS; GANGS are 

against SCHOOL POLICY.” In response to 

the cancellation of prom, one mousy character 

stammers, “This is insane that they’re doing 

this. I mean, this is America!” to which another 

character soberly replies, “No, it’s not America 

when you’re on school property … it’s the United 

States of Haldswell.”

I’d be lying if I didn’t say it was all a bit 

ridiculous at times. I’d also be remiss to deny the 

film’s flair and earnestness. Scenes are delicately 

shot, costumes are fun and stylish, and the prop 

department 
clearly 

had a blast designing 

the 
opulent 
campus 

and ornamented dorm 

rooms 
of 
Haldswell 

Boarding. 
Simone’s 

performance 
as 

Selah is gentle and 

yet 
commanding, 

and 
performances 

by 
her 
right-hand-

man Maxxie (Jharrel 

Jerome, “Moonlight”) 

and 
protégé 
Paloma 

(Celeste O’Connor, “Wetlands”) are equally 

believable and ooze that hallmark teenage 

commixture of angst and bravado. 

The Machiavellianism and shadow politics of 

a prep school underworld are ultimately a hard 

sell. They come off a little like that high school 

production of “Romeo and Juliet” you saw while 

visiting home last summer, where the Capulets 

and Montagues are competing coffee shops, 

Mercutio has a skateboard and Tybalt rocks a 

letterman jacket. It’s a little uneven, a bit over-

indulgent, but a decent enough way to kill a few 

hours. And considering the nature of the world at 

the moment, plenty of us have hours in — yes, I’m 

going to say it — spades.

‘Selah’ is a weirdly Shakespearean high school drama

FILM REVIEW

Before her debut, Rina Sawayama was the kind 

of low-key singer you’d come across on Spotify and 

think, Holy shit, she is going to have a career. Her 

first EP, RINA, remains one of the best musical 

projects of 2017. She burst onto the scene with a 

fresh pop sound that was in-your-face, uniquely 

undiluted and over-ornate. Her writing was 

breathtaking, her voice was sublime and her beats 

were out of this world — thanks to her producer, 

Clarence Clarity. He brought the best out of her, 

and she brought the best out of him: a musical 

match made in heaven. There was no reason 

SAWAYAMA couldn’t continue the rich aesthetic 

of RINA and still make for an unparalleled debut. 

But Rina would not settle for doing what was 

working. Her sound was destined to be built upon 

further. On SAWAYAMA, it transcends.

It was clear SAWAYAMA would be something 

different from “STFU!,” the first left hook Rina 

threw back in November. The ripping nu metal 

track was followed in January by left hook 

number two, “Comme Des Garçons (Like the 

Boys),” a sleek and sexy dance pop banger that was 

built for the club. They weren’t just different from 

Rina’s music of 2017 and 2018 — they couldn’t be 

more different from each other. Where “STFU!” 

was a simultaneously hilarious, frightening and 

enraging attack on microaggressions, “Comme 

Des Garçons” put toxic masculinity through a 

woodchipper, shredded beneath a beefy bassline 

and thumping kicks. By the time “XS” dropped — 

a critique of overconsumption — I was certain the 

rest of SAWAYAMA would consist of Rina leaning 

into her talent for satire.

I couldn’t have been more wrong. Literally 

every other track on the album is deeply personal. 

Vulnerability is nothing new to Rina, yet 

SAWAYAMA is especially intimate, a lens into 

the intricacies of Rina’s identity. Album opener 

“Dynasty” is a regretful reflection on Rina’s 

troubled childhood and her struggle to cope with 

her parents’ resentful relationship. Rina lays 

her heart bare, singing “Mother and father, you 

gave me life / I nearly gave it away for the sake 

of my sanity.” She continues to meditate on the 

role family plays in her identity throughout the 

entire record; titling it after her surname is no 

coincidence.

SAWAYAMA is the most Rina has ever grappled 

with her cultural identity over the microphone. 

She was born in Japan and moved to London 

with her family when she was five years old. On 

“Akasaka Sad,” written during a visit to Akasaka, 

Tokyo, Rina expresses feeling like she doesn’t 

belong in London or Tokyo, resonating with her 

parents’ own struggles as Japanese immigrants 

in London. Later, on “Bad Friend,” Rina sets 

the stage in Tokyo again, this time reminiscing 

about singing karaoke with a close friend during a 

fleeting summer getaway, a friend she would later 

fall out with. Rina revisits this Tokyo hotel setting 

a third time on “Tokyo Love Hotel,” a reference 

to Japanese hotels where rooms are paid by the 

hour, allowing couples a private space for sex. 

Here she compares foreigners’ blind idolization of 

Japan with a stay in a love hotel, leaving with no 

true appreciation or understanding of Japanese 

culture. But at the end of each chorus she sings, 

“I guess this is just another song ’bout Tokyo,” 

acknowledging that she herself is guilty of the 

same thing when she escapes to Tokyo in “Akasaka 

Sad” and “Bad Friend.” Her complicity in “using” 

Japan complicates her torn identity, and her wry 

self-awareness compels empathy.

Rina eschews delicacy for candor, both lyrically 

and sonically. “Paradisin’” is blatantly bubblegum 

pop, hyper-exciting, sparkly and glitzy. It’s the 

opening theme to a SAWAYAMA sitcom, or the 

soundtrack to an ’80s film montage of teen girls 

sneaking out to go shopping at the mall. Rina 

unabashedly delights in the trouble she got into 

as a teenager, the juicy electropop tune embracing 

overjoyed rebellion against her single mother. 

Rina sings, “Then you threaten to send me to / 

Boarding school for the seventh time / I know we 

can’t afford that, so I’m fine.” These lines are a gut 

punch, revealing layers of malice and immaturity 

in teenage Rina’s attitude toward her mother 

beneath the song’s bubblegum exterior. 

Two thematic cornerstones of the album are 

“Love Me 4 Me” and “Chosen Family.” The first 

track deals with Rina’s struggle to love herself. The 

second is about the solace Rina has found in her 

chosen family, emphasizing an important form 

of interpersonal support for many queer people 

whose relationships with their biological families 

become strained or broken (Rina came out as 

pansexual in 2018). Unfortunately, both songs lack 

the lyrical depth of the rest of the album. For such 

heart-wrenching topics, they’re addressed with 

unremarkable simplicity; reading the title of each 

track is enough to understand the point of each 

song. For the most part, neither track is strong 

enough instrumentally or interesting enough 

structurally to warrant such simplicity. Despite 

this, “Chosen Family” is a compelling climax to 

the album’s overarching theme of family.

The final track, “Snakeskin,” is a feverish closer, 

terrifying yet beautiful, solemn yet heartracing. 

The metaphor of a snakeskin handbag, used and 

abused and destroyed, is one of the most cryptic. 

But at the end, it returns to Rina relating to her 

mother. As Rina tells Apple Music, she samples 

Beethoven’s “Sonata Pathétique” because it is the 

only song she can remember her mom playing on 

the piano, and a quiet sample of her mother’s own 

voice says in Japanese, “I’ve realized that now I 

want to see who I want to see, do what I want to do, 

be who I want to be.” Recalling Rina’s reference to 

her father’s infidelity on “Dynasty,” her mother as 

the snakeskin — used and abused and destroyed 

— is an intriguing thought with which to close the 

album.

SAWAYAMA rolls a staggering number of 

concepts into the complicated intersection of 

Rina’s identity in its 43-minute runtime. Toxic 

masculinity, 
parental 
rebellion, 
adolescent 

depression, microaggressions, broken households 

— Rina does each of them justice through her 

music. Interspersed within the record’s family-

centric narrative is self-aware criticism of 

overconsumption and cultural objectification. 

Lyrically, there’s so much to unpack in this album 

that it’s almost overwhelming. By the time I’ve 

truly understood the depth of SAWAYAMA, the 

once little-known singer will be filling stadiums.

ZAKYI, OSMAN
From Page 8

Zakyi knows this easily could’ve 

been him. 

“I was one of the luckiest that 

went through and got selected,” 

he said. “I know there are a lot of 

talents back home that have so 

much potential. I know a lot of the 

guys that went through the tryouts, 

they all went back home and they 

go home to nothing.

“That’s why it’ll always be my 

motivation, that I’m going to give 

back no matter what.”

Before staying at Michigan for 

summer classes last year, Zakyi 

would spend his summers in Ghana. 

During his first week at home he’d 

volunteer at the Academy: talking 

with younger kids, offering up 

advice, telling tales about America, 

helping out in the classroom. He 

wanted every kid to know that he’s 

still a part of them, “part of their 

family.”

“Whether it’s with my success, 

my knowledge or my experience, I 

know I can always have an impact 

on someone’s life,” Zakyi said. “I 

want to be able to put someone in a 

better position just like I was given 

a better life, too. It’s something 

that I owe to my community, that 

I owe to people who aspire to be 

great people. I want to be a part of 

their journey. I want to help them 

achieve their dreams.”

Osman has been back once, 

the summer between his senior 

year of high school and freshman 

year of college. He called it “very 

different,” 
returning 
to 
the 

Academy and seeing all the younger 

kids in the shoes he once wore. 

“I had just won the Gatorade 

National Player of the Year, which 

was talked about at the Academy,” 

Osman said. “So when I went back, 

a lot of the kids knew of me. 

“I always value the idea of giving 

back. Right to Dream gave me 

something special, so in the future 

I hope that I’m going to go back to 

my village and help give back and 

inspire young kids to follow their 

dreams.”

As 
for 
their 
own 
dreams, 

Osman and Zakyi are living them, 

preparing to leave Michigan next 

spring with four years of collegiate 

soccer under their belt and, more 

importantly, college degrees. 

Their roots — from the clay 

streets of Tamale to the Academy 

— are with them every step of the 

way. 

“Looking back home and the 

situation my family and everyone 

is in, it just gives me motivation 

to keep pushing to get to my goal,” 

Osman said. 

“Then one day, all this hard 

work, all these sacrifices that I’ve 

made will pay.”

No. 3 Michigan survives defensive scare 
against Maryland, remains undefeated

After 
a 
lackluster 
offensive 

performance against Arkansas State 

last week, first-year coach Stanford 

Lipsey hit a crossroads in our NCAA 

14 simulation of Michigan football. 

Defenses clearly figured out how 

to slow down the “throw it to Nico 

Collins” philosophy that worked so 

well in the opener against then-No. 

4 Washington. The Wolverines will 

need to find other ways to move the 

ball, especially when the toughest part 

of the schedule arrives in November. 

Luckily for Michigan, it opens 

up Big Ten play with three of the 

conference’s 
bottom 
feeders 
— 

Northwestern, Maryland and Rutgers 

— offering ample opportunity to 

experiment with new looks and get 

the offense back on the right track. 

Game 5: No. 3 Michigan vs 

Northwestern

Over the years, this particular 

matchup has developed a special 

talent to age viewers by decades. 

What I mean is, games between the 

Wildcats and Wolverines are terrible. 

How can we ever forget the 

2014 meeting, forever enshrined 

as the M00N game because of the 

scoreboard’s endless display of 0-0? 

Or the previous year’s matchup, 

where Michigan won in overtime 

after neither team scored a single 

touchdown in regulation?

This game was no exception. It 

felt like a Michigan v. Northwestern 

game from the very first drive, when 

redshirt junior quarterback Dylan 

McCaffrey fumbled the ball on a 

scramble at the Wildcats’ 15-yard line. 

The horrors continued three minutes 

later, 
when 
Lipsey 
inexplicably 

elected to punt on a fourth-and-1 at 

Northwestern’s 40-yard line. 

But the Wolverines’ luck turned 

late in the second quarter. After 

McCaffrey found sophomore wide 

receiver 
Mike 
Sainristil 
in 
the 

endzone to open the scoring with 54 

seconds remaining, Northwestern 

coach Pat Fitzgerald decided to be 

aggressive and go for a game-tying 

touchdown, a strategy unheard of 

between these two teams. 

Sophomore cornerback Vincent 

Gray intercepted the pass and a 

touchdown pass to senior wide receiver 

Nico Collins followed moments later. It 

was the last touchdown of the day and 

Michigan won, 17-6. Stat of the day: On 

eight combined red zone trips, the two 

teams totaled two touchdowns and 

one field goal. 

Game 6: No. 2 Michigan at Maryland

The Wolverines’ offense did its job. 

Sophomore wide receiver Giles Jackson 

cut through the defense, notching 139 

yards and two touchdowns on eight 

catches. All season long, he’s been a 

huge part of a deep receiving corps 

that’s earned Michigan the second-

best passing offense in the country. 

This time, it was the Wolverines’ 

defense that prevented a blowout 

victory. Michigan won, 34-29, but the 

Terrapins’ 460 yards of offense — 360 

of which came through the air — kept 

the game close throughout. Maryland 

wide receiver Brian Cobbs torched 

defensive backs all game, pulling in 

nine catches for 141 yards and two 

touchdowns.

After 55 minutes of being straw 

men, the defense finally stepped 

up on the final drive of the game. 

Led by quarterback Josh Jackson, 

the Terrapins made their way into 

Michigan territory before a third-

down sack by senior defensive end 

Kwity Paye shut down any hopes for a 

comeback.

It was an ugly win, but the 

Wolverines 
are 
still 
undefeated 

halfway through the season. They’ll 

be fine. 

Game 7: No. 2 Michigan vs Rutgers

On the first play from scrimmage, 

McCaffrey found Collins for a 75-yard 

touchdown. The next drive, he threw 

another touchdown to Jackson. The 

drive after that, Jackson again. 

Michigan won, 52-14, on a Heisman-

level performance from McCaffrey. 

His 21-for-31 passing night resulted 

in 430 yards and five touchdowns. 

Four of those were caught by Jackson, 

tying the record for most receiving 

touchdowns in a single game in school 

history. 

Across the board, the Wolverines 

put up similarly ludicrous numbers. 

Rutgers totaled 283 total yards, but 

only 45 of them came on the ground. 

In their six trips to the red zone, 

the Scarlet Knights scored just two 

touchdowns and no field goals. Even 

Michigan’s punting was dominant — 

each of its punts went for 52 yards and 

no return. 

In the end, the No. 2 team in the 

country was playing Rutgers. You can 

fill in the rest of the equation.

Around the country

Last week, I called the situation 

around 
the 
country 
“markedly 

ordinary.” That take aged poorly.

I’ll get right to it: Indiana is ranked 

seventh. The team it replaced? Ohio 

State, which dropped to No. 13 

after losing at home to now-No. 11 

Cincinnati. Arizona State snuck up 

to No. 9 after a big win against No. 25 

Colorado, which is, in this game, still 

coached by a virtual Mel Tucker who 

follows through on his promises. LSU 

dropped out of the rankings, after 

losing three consecutive games to No. 

14 Mississippi State, No. 3 Florida and 

Tennessee. 

McCaffrey’s performance against 

Rutgers propelled him to third in the 

Heisman watch, behind Alabama 

running back Najee Harris and Boston 

College running back David Bailey. 

Michigan’s 
pretty 
happy 
with 

7-0 right now, but it can’t get too 

comfortable. Its next three games, 

against rival Michigan State, Penn 

State 
and 
the 
seventh-ranked 

Hoosiers, will be a real test of the 

team’s toughness. 

MILES MACKLIN/Daily

Sophomore wide receiver Giles Jackson caught four touchdowns against Rutgers.

Wolverines look strong 
with returning redshirts

Sean Bormet had everything 

perfectly planned out.

Three of his top wrestlers would 

redshirt the 2020 season to prepare 

for the Olympics. They’d compete 

in Tokyo this summer. Then they’d 

come back for their final season at 

Michigan, joining a team loaded with 

talent and primed to contend.

It was an arrangement that 

should’ve 
worked 
for 
everyone. 

Instead, all of it is in flux.

First, COVID-19 canceled the 

NCAA 
Championships. 
Then 
it 

pushed the Olympics back to 2021. 

Now, Bormet and the Michigan 

wrestling team must adapt again.

Fifth-year seniors Myles Amine, 

Logan Massa and Stevan Micic, all 

of whom took Olympic redshirts 

last year, plan to return to the 

Wolverines for the 2021 season while 

simultaneously training for Tokyo. 

According to Amine, the Wolverines 

haven’t received official word from 

the NCAA on whether they will 

be able to take a second Olympic 

redshirt. But all three are already 

sold on coming back.

If Amine, Micic and Massa — all 

former All-Americans — returned, 

they knew they would join a team with 

four additional 2020 All-Americans 

in junior Mason Parris (ranked No. 2 

in the country at heavyweight), fifth-

year senior Kanen Storr, redshirt 

sophomore Will Lewan and redshirt 

junior Jack Medley, as well as a 

two-time cadet world champion in 

redshirt freshman Kurt McHenry.

That’s eight top competitors of 10 

lineup spots.

For Massa, going so long without 

competition left him restless. Micic, 

who is 24 years old and was already 

on his second Olympic redshirt, is 

just ready to finish out his college 

career. And for Amine, it was already 

tough spending one year on the 

sidelines, not being able to travel or 

wear a Michigan singlet.

“I don’t want to be in college 

forever, as much as that sounds like 

everybody’s dream,” Amine said. 

“I’m going on six years this next year, 

so I’m ready to move on to the next 

stage and graduate, get that all over 

with.”

So although the circumstances 

aren’t ideal, all three are excited 

to get back to competing with the 

Wolverines. Amine, who competes 

for San Marino, and Micic, who 

competes for Serbia, have already 

qualified for the Games, taking much 

of the pressure of a pre-Olympic year 

off.

That 
isn’t 
without 
its 

complications, though.

There are just six weight classes 

in the Olympics compared to 10 in 

the NCAA. That means all three 

wrestlers have a variation in the 

weights they’ll compete at in college 

and 
international 
competition, 

leaving the question of whether some 

may move up or down weight classes 

next season.

“Part of the conversations for that 

is trying to strike the right balance for 

the right college weight and I think 

the right college weight is our No. 1 

priority and in the process of making 

those decisions,” Bormet said. “There 

are some considerations for how 

they may impact any of our athletes’ 

international weights.”

Amine previously wrestled at 174 

pounds, but with his international 

weight at 189, he knows he’ll 

realistically have to move up next 

season — though it has yet to be 

determined whether that will be 

to 184 pounds or 197. Massa plans 

to move up to 174 pounds from 

165, filling Amine’s void. Micic’s 

international weight is 125 pounds, 

but he doesn’t plan to move all the 

way down to that class at Michigan 

(Medley, the Wolverines’ starter 

there last season, was an All-

American honorable mention and 

qualified for NCAA Championships). 

Instead, Micic says he will wrestle at 

133 or 141 pounds, keeping in mind 

that the more weight he has to cut for 

the Olympics, the harder it will be on 

his body.

Micic and Amine have also 

considered 
wrestling 
a 
limited 

schedule during the regular season, 

competing in only the most important 

duals and sitting out others in order 

to keep their bodies fresh. That could 

also give some of the Wolverines’ 

younger wrestlers, who may have 

anticipated a lineup spot in 2021, a 

chance to compete.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

From Ghana to Ann Arbor, Osman and Zakyi don’t forget their past 

The ball was often makeshift, a 

few paper bags knotted together 

or a pile of folded clothes tightly 

wound 
by 
rubber 
bands. 
The 

children kicked it around with their 

bare feet, the bottoms caked with 

dust and sand. The street was their 

pitch, and the kids scurried in and 

out of oncoming traffic. 

It wasn’t perfect. But it was 

soccer. 

For junior forwards Umar Farouk 

Osman and Mohammed Zakyi, 

this was how their careers started. 

Long before being teammates at 

Michigan, they roamed the red 

clay streets of Tamale, Ghana, as 

neighbors from lower-middle class 

families who played every day until 

the sun went down. 

“Everyone knew who I was, 

everyone knew who Umar was, 

because anywhere there was a 

soccer match going on, we were 

there,” Zakyi said. “That’s how 

Umar and I knew each other, we 

were always playing soccer.”

Osman and Zakyi’s paths from 

Ghana 
to 
Ann 
Arbor 
started 

together 
and 
largely 
remained 

together. Each departed Ghana 

— Osman at 15, Zakyi at 17 — to 

attend preparatory high schools in 

Connecticut on scholarship. Before 

that, each attended the prestigious 

Right to Dream Academy in the 

country’s Eastern Region. 

Founded in 1999 by Tom Vernon, 

Right to Dream doubles as both a 

school and soccer factory, designed 

to outfit younger players with 

opportunities to advance their skills 

on a=nd off the pitch — opportunities 

they might not otherwise have. 

“I got to the Academy and it 

meant everything,” Zakyi said. “I 

was provided with soccer cleats. I 

was given food, given shelter, given 

education. Everything was provided 

for, and that’s when I started taking 

soccer more seriously.”

Spots in the Academy are both 

limited and highly coveted. Once a 

year, Right to Dream sends scouts 

to each of Ghana’s 10 regions to hold 

tryouts. Osman remembers close to 

500 kids swarming his, with each 

hopeful having only 20 minutes of 

playing time to prove himself. 

From the initial field, scouts 

chose 11 players from each region 

to move on to the second tryout. 

This pool is then narrowed down to 

one final group of 11 who compete 

against current Academy-goers, a 

test to see if they can hang with the 

tougher competition. 

Osman and Zakyi each joined 

Right to Dream in 2009, each only 

10 years old. 

“It was very stressful,” Osman 

remembered. “First the tryouts, 

then leaving your family that young 

to go to a completely different 

place. There were points when I 

got homesick, but I kept thinking 

that my institution at home wasn’t 

that great, and Right to Dream was 

giving me this great opportunity. 

So I had to overcome my fear and 

I think at that moment I became a 

man, working for myself and my 

family.”

At 
Right 
to 
Dream, 
the 

opportunities 
were 
boundless. 

Osman and Zakyi traveled the 

world, competing against other top 

academies. Zakyi spent time from 

the U12 level to the U18 training 

with Manchester United. Each 

had access to training, expertise 

and invaluable experience in a 

professional soccer environment. 

Soon, 
scouts 
took 
notice 
and 

America beckoned. 

But to get to America — to earn a 

scholarship to a preparatory school 

— prowess on the pitch wasn’t 

enough. Soccer skills had to be 

accompanied by good grades. 

“Growing up, I didn’t want to go 

to school,” Osman confessed. “My 

mom, she always wanted me to 

go to school, but we didn’t always 

have the financial support. Right 

to Dream came along and I learned 

the value in getting an education 

because soccer isn’t going to be 

there forever.”

Soccer can be a passion, but it 

can’t be life. It’s a lesson Zakyi 

learned the hard way. 

A torn meniscus suffered early on 

in his career at the Academy forced 

him to the sidelines for two years, 

stripping him of his foundation. 

“That’s when I decided to take 

school 
very 
seriously,” 
Zakyi 

said. “Because I knew if I don’t do 

anything about school and this 

happens to me in the professional 

world, my life is done. It was all 

soccer, soccer, soccer until the 

injury. But after, I started studying 

really hard, taking a lot of exams so 

I could not only come to America 

but also succeed in the classroom.”

Getting an education is a luxury 

that Zakyi’s dad, a high school 

dropout, never could afford. Same 

for a handful of Zakyi’s childhood 

friends who quit school and reverted 

to hustling and violence after their 

respective soccer careers flopped. 

None were fortunate enough to use 

soccer, a passion, as a springboard 

to greater heights in life.

Projecting Michigan’s 2020 starters in the absence of spring play

This past Saturday would have 

been Michigan’s spring game if not 

for COVID-19, but in its absence 

all that remains is speculation on 

what we might have seen. The 

biggest takeaway from spring games 

is typically getting a peek at the 

rotations and seeing who works out 

with the first team. Luckily, we’re 

not totally in the dark. The 2019 

season offered plenty of clues as to 

who could be among the Wolverines’ 

starters in 2020. The Daily’s football 

beat projected Michigan’s starting 

lineup and broke it down, position 

by position:

Quarterback: Dylan McCaffrey

This position has been a highly-

publicized battle between redshirt 

junior Dylan McCaffrey and redshirt 

sophomore Joe Milton. Both have 

their pros and cons — Milton has a 

big arm but lacks accuracy, while 

McCaffrey has more speed but less 

arm strength. Neither has had many 

in-game reps the past few years and 

without a spring season, it’s nearly 

impossible to tell where the battle 

is at. That said, the lack of spring 

practice probably gives McCaffrey, 

with his extra year of experience 

— something Michigan coach Jim 

Harbaugh values immensely — the 

edge. Still, offensive coordinator 

Josh Gattis has expressed a desire to 

use both quarterbacks extensively 

in 2020 and this position should 

continue to be one of intrigue 

throughout the season.

Running 
back: 
Zach 

Charbonnet and Hassan Haskins

Arguably 
Michigan’s 
deepest 

offensive 
position 
group, 
this 

season’s 
running 
backs 
room 

should be among the Wolverines’ 

strong suits. The run game has two 

reliable workhorses in sophomore 

Zach 
Charbonnet, 
who 
broke 

the program’s freshman rushing 

touchdown 
record 
last 
season, 

and redshirt sophomore Hassan 

Haskins, 
who 
made 
a 
strong 

impression in the second half of 2019 

after converting from linebacker. 

Beyond that, Michigan will welcome 

back senior Chris Evans from a one-

year academic suspension, while 

freshman Blake Corum and redshirt 

sophomore 
Christian 
Turner 

could factor in as well. In Gattis’s 

up-tempo offense, there’ll be plenty 

of snaps to go around.

Wide receiver: Nico Collins, 

Ronnie Bell and Giles Jackson

Michigan returns its two biggest 

producers at the position in Ronnie 

Bell and Nico Collins, making this 

one of the offense’s strongest spots 

headed into next year. We already 

know that Bell can produce at a 

high level in the college game, as he 

broke out last year to become Shea 

Patterson’s favorite target. Collins 

comes into next season as one of the 

most potent big-play threats in the 

conference, standing 6-foot-4 with 

jump-ball ability that stands out. 

Behind them, Giles Jackson figures 

to get a bulk of snaps in the slot or 

H-back positions after a freshman 

year that saw Gattis get better 

and better at leveraging Jackson’s 

unique skill set. 

Offensive line: Jaylen Mayfield, 

Chuck Filiaga, Zach Carpenter, 

Andrew Stueber and Ryan Hayes

This group is arguably Michigan’s 

biggest question mark outside of 

quarterback going into 2020. The 

unit loses four starters from a year 

ago, leaving only junior right tackle 

Jalen Mayfield. All four of those 

departures could be selected in this 

weekend’s NFL Draft, which speaks 

to the talent that the Wolverines are 

losing at the position. Fortunately 

for Harbaugh, he and his staff 

have recruited well at the position 

recently, leaving Michigan with a 

deep but unproven group for 2020. 

Ryan Hayes figures to slot in at left 

tackle, where he started in place of 

the injured Jon Runyan early last 

season. Hayes is a 6-foot-7 former 

TE, giving him a prototypical 

tackle’s body.

At guard, Stueber and Filiaga 

are the most likely starters. Stueber 

was in a battle with Mayfield for 

the starting right tackle position 

last year, before tearing his ACL in 

fall camp. Though he was playing 

tackle before the injury, his bigger 

frame means he’ll likely shift to 

guard to make way for Hayes and 

Mayfield at tackle. As for the other 

guard spot, Nolan Rumler was a 

four-star recruit in 2019, giving him 

the highest upside of Michigan’s 

potential 
options, 
but 
Filiaga’s 

additional two years of experience 

make him the most likely option. 

He’s been the Wolverines’ backup 

left guard for the past two seasons, 

seeing snaps in eight total games.

Michigan’s 
biggest 
challenge 

on the offensive line will likely 

be replacing center Cesar Ruiz, 

a potential first-round pick on 

Thursday. The top candidates seem 

to be sophomore Zach Carpenter and 

fifth-year senior Andrew Vastardis, 

who has backed up the position the 

past two years. Carpenter, though, 

received plenty of buzz last year and 

was named Michigan’s offensive 

scout team player of the year.
