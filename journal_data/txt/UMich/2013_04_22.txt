MRelay raises over$ 300K

2,000 students
come out for event
at Ferry Field
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
DailyNewsEditor
While libraries and cof-
fee shops across campus were
filled with University students
cramming for exams this past
weekend, more than 2,000 stu-
dents took a study break to raise
money for cancer research.
Against a backdrop of live
music performances, on-site
fundraisers and appearances

by members of the Michigan
football and men's basketball
teams, MRelay - the Univer-
sity's annual Relay For Life
event - was held Saturday
through Sunday at Ferry Field
outdoor track. Relay For Life is
a national 24-hour fundraising
event for the American Cancer
Society, and MRelay is the sec-
ond largest collegiate event in
the country.
Though the MRelay team.
doesn't stop counting monetary
contributions until August,
this weekend's event raised
$310,388.71 for cancer research.
By August, MRelay's goal is to
raise $372,000, $2,000 more

than the 2012 event took in.
Despite the cold tempera-
tures and new location, more
than 130 student organiza-
tions formed teams to partici-
pate activities, which included
Relay Idol, flag football, a scav-
enger hunt and the Mr. Relay
male pageant.
The teams of students
camped out around the field
from 10 a.m. Saturday until 10
a.m. Sunday. Reflecting on the
theme "Celebrate, Remem-
ber, Fight Back," there was an
opening celebratory ceremony
to empower participants, a
night-time Luminaria Cere-
mony to remember those who

lost their battles with cancer
and a Fight Back ceremony
to inspire students to take
action.
Kinesiology junior Sara
Knysh, a member of MRelay's
executive team, said she was
inspired to join the effort to
cure cancer because several
people in her family have been
affected by the disease.
"It's pretty personal for me;
it means a lot to my family,"
Knysh said. "It just means a lot
to be able to help everyone else
out."
Knysh said planning the
event was a rewarding process,

Mrs. Field's, Auntie
Anne's to depart,
Wendy's and
Subway will stay
By K.C. WASSMAN
Daily News Editor
After anticipation and spec-
ulation, including fake signs
suggesting Chick-fil-A and
McDonalds would be leasing
space, University Unions has
announced the tenant line-up
for the Michigan Union's ground
floor food court, the Michigan
Union Grill.
Ahmo's Gyros and Deli will
join current vendors Wendy's,
Subway and Panda Express in
MUG in August, while Pizza
Hut, Mrs. Fields, Freshens and
Auntie Anne's will vacate their
spaces after their leases expire
at the end of the month.
Union officials have not yet
made a decision on whether
they plan to allow Amer's
Mediterranean Deli to renew
its first-floor lease, Laura
Seagram, marketing and com-
munications specialist for Uni-
versity Unions, wrote in an
e-mail. Seagram said they hope

to have a final decision over
the summer.
After it was suggested that
Amer's would likely close, a
Facebook page was created to
rally support to keep the deli
in the Union. Though the deli's
owner said the page was created
by a customer, E. Royster Harp-
er, the University's vice presi-
dent for student affairs, accused
the owner of creating the page
himself.
Ahmo's, which currently is
a guest vendor one day a week
at Pierpont Commons, will sell
Mediterranean staples like
falafels, gyros, hummus and
pita sandwiches. Owner Majed
Issa said the restaurant's food
seems to be very popular with
the students at Pierpont. He is
currently planning for Ahmo's
to stay in the Union for at least
10 years, with two five-year
leases.
"We're looking forward to
being there," Issa said, "hope-
fully all the students are looking
forward to it too."
Issa said Ahmo's will replace
the space currently occupied
by Auntie Anne's pretzels, Mrs.
Fields cookies and Freshens
smoothies. It will be operational
by Aug. 16.

CAMPUS LIFE
NAACP hosts
Image Awards
at art museum

Ceremony honors
students for
contributions to
community
By SAM GRINGLAS
DailyStaffReporter
Beneath the University of
Michigan Museum of Art atri-
um, more than 70 University
students gathered to recognize
the achievements of their peers
during the fifth annual Nation-
al Association for the Advance-
ment of Colored People Image
Awards.
The gathering was hosted by
the University's chapter of the
NAACP, which presented 21
awards to University students
and campus groups at Sunday's
ceremony.
"We try to make sure we
recognize all the hard work
students have put in through-
out the year," said LSA junior
Michael Dalton, the chapter's
president-elect.

The University's NAACP
chapter began holding Image
Awards to mirror a ceremony
held by the national organiza-
tion since 1967. Image awards
recognize achievements in
television, literature, film and
music, as well as achievement
in social justice through cre-
ative outlets. Similarly, the
campus awards acknowledge
scholastic advancement and
social justice contributions by
University students, faculty
and administrators.
Before the event,Kinesiology
senior Dexter Mason reflected
on what he called a bittersweet
moment as he attended the
Image Awards for his fourth
and final time.
"Events like this are very
important because in the black
community I feel like there
aren't any other events that
highlight what the black com-
munity does," Mason said. "It's
a good way to have a sense of
community."

By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
Whether students were raised
here or halfway around the
world, Ann Arbor becomes their
home for their college years.
Saturday, about 100 students
picked up garbage and engaged
in service work at seven parks in
their adopted hometown as part
of the Big Thank You A2 event
organized by members of the
Central Student Government.
CSG President Manish Parikh
spent one of his last days as the
CSG executive picking up gar-
bage. He wrote in an e-mail it
was important he show apprecia-
tion to the city he called home for
the duration of his undergradu-
ate experience.
"The goal for Big Thank You
A2 is to thank the city of Ann
Arbor for being such a wonderful
and kind neighbor to U-M and its
students," Parikh wrote. "Hope-
fully in the future the number
of students volunteering will go
from 100to1,000."

Com-munity runs for Boston

Student organizes
run in solidarity
with victims
By AMRUTHA SIVAKUMAR
Daily StaffReporter
One by one, runners from
all over Ann Arbor and metro
Detroit crossed the one-mile
mark at the Diag. There were no
fists in the air, no cheers from
the crowd. Instead, there were
thoughts of those who had lost

or were fighting for their lives
after the events following the
Boston Marathon.
Wearing marathon bibs that
uniformly read "We are all Bos-
ton Marathoners at Heart," run-
ners came together Saturday
morning for a Solidarity Run -
circling a one-mile loop as many
times as they could in support
of victims of the bombings and
shootings in Boston.
Three people - including
eight-year-old Martin Richard,
29-year-old Krystle Campbell
and graduate student Lu Lingzi

- were killed and over 170 peo-
ple were wounded after a ter-
rorist attack involving several
bombs at the race's finish.
In conjunction with numer-
ous other solidarity runs being
held across the country, Public
Policy graduate student Jimmy
Schneidewind organized the
event to give an opportunity for
local runners to show Boston
runners that they stood with
them.
About 200 runners partici-
pated in the run, includingsome

Spring storms
affecting Michigan
sugar beet farmers
Heavy rainstorms this spring
have forced Michigan sugar beet
growers to postpone planting.
Michigan State University
Extension educator and sugar beet
expert Steven Poindexter says it's
not time to panic despite the delay.
He tells MLive.com that
although earlier planting of sugar
beets means more growing time
and usually larger beets, farmers
have planted them as late as June
some years and still had a success-
ful harvest.
Dave Zwerk of Tuscola County-
based Zwerk & Sons Farms says
he's hoping his 1,200 sugar beet
acres will be ready for planting in
the coming weeks.
Zwerk says if he "can get in
there in the next week or so," he
"might not lose a lot of yield."
DENVER
Snowboarders
killed in
avalanche ID'd
Authorities have released the
names of four Colorado snow-
boarders and one skier killed over
the weekend in the state's dead-
liest avalanche in more than 50
years.
Clear Creek County Sheriff Don
Krueger said search and rescue
crews recovered the men's bod-
ies from a backcountry area on
Loveland Pass several hours after
Saturday afternoon's slide, which
was estimated to be about 600 feet
wide and eight feet deep. All of
the men were equipped with ava-
lanche beacons.
The sheriff identified the vic-
tims Sunday as Christopher
Peters, 32, of Lakewood; Joseph
Timlin, 32, of Gypsum; Ryan
Novack, 33, of Boulder; Ian Lan-
phere, 36, of Crested Butte; and
Rick Gaukel, 33, of Estes Park.

Rivers crest across
Midwest; more
rain in forecast
Those fighting floods in several
communities along the Missis-
sippi River were mostly success-
ful Sunday despite the onslaught
of water, but an ominous forecast
and the growing accumulation of
snow in the upper Midwest tem-
pered any feelings of victory.
The surging Mississippi was at
or near crest at several places from
the Quad Cities south to near St.
Louis - some reaching 10-12 feet
above flood stage. Problems were
plentiful: Hundreds of thousands
of acres of swamped farmland as
planting season approaches; three

people died; roads and bridges
closed, including sections of major
highways like U.S. 61 in Iowa and
Missouri and crossings at Quincy,
Ill., and Louisiana, Mo.
NEW DELHI, India
Condition of Indian
child who was
raped improves
The condition of a 5-year-old
girl who was raped, tortured and
then left alone in a locked room
for two days has improved, a doc-
tor said, as protests continued in
India's capital over the authori-
ties' handlingof the case.
The girl was in critical condi-
tion when she was transferred
Thursday from a local hospital to
the largest government-run hospi-
tal in the country. But D.K. Shar-
ma, medical superintendent of the
state-run hospital in New Delhi
where the girl was being treated,
said Sunday that she was respond-
ing well to treatment and that her
condition had stabilized.
Police say the girl went miss-
ing April 15 and was found two
days later by neighbors who heard
her crying in a locked room in the
same New Delhi building where
she lives with her family.

Rural China rushes relief after Bombing suspects
quake kills 186, injures 11,000 planned more attacks

Earthquake with 7.0
magnitude leaves
survivors struggling
to access aid
LUSHAN, China (AP) - Luo
Shiqiang sat near chunks of con-
crete, bricks and a ripped orange
sofa and told how his grandfa-
ther was just returning from
feeding chickens when their
house collapsed and crushed
him to death in this weekend's
powerful earthquake in south-
western China.
"We lost everything in such
a short time," the 20-year-old
college student said Sunday.
He said his cousin also was
injured in the collapse, but
that other members of his fam-
ily were spared because they
were out working in the fields
of hard-hit Longmen village in
Lushan county.
Saturday's earthquake in
Sichuan province killed at least
186 people, injured more than
11,000 and left nearly two dozen
missing, mostly in the rural
communities around Ya'an city,
along the same fault line where
a devastating quake to the north
killed more than 90,000 people
in Sichuan and neighboring
areas five years ago in one of
China's worst natural disasters.
The Lushan and Baoxing
counties hardest-hit on Satur-
day had escaped the worst of
the damage in the 2008 quake,
and residents there said they
benefited little from the region's
rebuilding after the disaster,
with no special reinforcements
made or new evacuation proce-
dures introduced in their remote
communities.
Luo said he wished more had
been done to make his commu-
nity's buildings quake-resistant.
"Maybe the country's leaders
really wanted to help us, but
when it comes to the lower levels
the officials don't carry it out,"
he said.

Police say wealth
of weapons suggest
other possible hits
BOSTON (AP) - As churches
paused to mourn the dead and
console the survivors of the Bos-
ton Marathon bombing Sunday,
the city's police commissioner
said the two suspects had such
a large cache of weapons that
they were probably planning
other attacks. The survivingsus-
pect remained hospitalized and
unable to speak with a gunshot
wound to the throat.
After the two brothers
engaged in a gun battle with
police early Friday, authorities
found many unexploded home-
made bombs at the scene, along
with more than 250 rounds of
ammunition.
Police Commissioner Ed Davis
said the stockpile was "as dan-
gerous as it gets in urban polic-
ing."
"We have reason to believe,
based upon the evidence that was
found at that scene - the explo-
sions, the explosive ordnance
that was unexploded and the
firepower that they had - that
they were going to attack other
individuals. That's my belief
at this point" Davis told CBS's
"Face the Nation."
On "Fox News Sunday," he
said authorities cannot be posi-
tive there are not more explo-
sives somewhere that have not
been found. But the people of
Boston are safe, he insisted.
The suspects in the twin
bombings that killed three peo-
ple and wounded more than 180
are two ethnic Chechen brothers
from southern Russia - 19-year-
old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his
26-year-old brother, Tamerlan.
Their motive remained unclear.
The older brother was killed
during a getaway attempt. The
younger brother, Dzhokhar Tsar-
naev, was still in serious condi-
tion Sunday after his capture
Friday from a tarp-covered boat
in a suburban Boston backyard.
Authorities would not comment
on whether he had been ques-
tioned.
Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana,
a member of the Senate Intel-
ligence Committee, said Tsar-
naev's throat wound raised
questions about when he will be
able to talk again, if ever.
The wound "doesn't mean he
can't communicate, but right
now I think he's in a condition
where we can't get any informa-
tion from him at all," Coats told
ABC's "This Week."
It was not clear whether Tsar-
naev was shot by police or inflict-
ed the wound himself.
In the final standoff with
police, shots were fired from the
boat, but investigators have not

determined where the gunfire
was aimed, Davis said.
In an interview with The
Associated Press, the parents of
Tamerlan Tsarnaev insisted Sun-
day that he came to Dagestan and
Chechnya last year to visit rela-
tives and had nothing to do with
the militants operating in the
volatile part of Russia. His father
said he slept much of the time.
The younger Tsarnaev could
be charged any day. The most
serious charge available to fed-
eral prosecutors would be the
use of a weapon of mass destruc-
tion to kill people, which carries
a possible death sentence. Massa-
chusetts does not have the death
penalty.
Across the rattled streets of
Boston, churches opened their
doors to remember the dead and
ease the grief of the living.
At the Cathedral of the Holy
Cross in South Boston, photo-
graphs of the three people killed
in the attack and a Massachusetts
Institute of Technology police
officer slain Thursday were dis-
played on the altar, each face illu-
minated by a glowing white pillar
candle.
"I hope we can all heal and
move forward," said Kelly McK-
ernan, who was crying as she left
the service. "And obviously, the
Mass today was a first step for us
in that direction."
A six-block segment of
Boylston Street,where the bombs
were detonated, remained closed
Sunday. But city officials were
mapping out a plan to reopen it.
Mayor Thomas Menino said
Sunday that once the scene is
released by the FBI, the city will
follow a five-step process, includ-
ing environmental testing and a
safety assessment of buildings.
The exact timetable was uncer-
tain.
Boston's historic Trinity
Church could not host services
Sunday because it was within
the crime scene, but the congre-
gation was invited to worship at
the Temple Israel synagogue
instead. The FBI allowed
church officials a half-hour
Saturday to go inside to gather
the priests' robes, the wine and
bread for Sunday's service.
Trinity's Rev. Samuel T.
Lloyd III offered a prayer for
those who were slain "and for
those who must rebuild their
lives without the legs that they
ran and walked on last week."
"So where is God when the
terrorists do their work?" Lloyd
asked. "God is there, holding
us and sustaining us. God is in
the pain the victims are suffer-
ing, and the healing that will go
on. God is with us as we try still
to build a just world, a world
where there will not be terror-
ists doing their terrible dam-
age."

Officials say at least 185 killed in
Nigeria gun and grenade attack

Officials unable
to discern civilian
deaths from
extremist fighters
BAGA,Nigeria(AP) - Fighting
between Nigeria's military and
Islamic extremists killed at least
185peopleinafishingcommunity
in the nation's far northeast, offi-
cials said Sunday, an attack that
saw insurgents fire rocket-pro-
pelledgrenadesand soldiersspray
machine-gun fire into neighbor-
hoods filled with civilians.
The fighting in Baga began
Friday and lasted for hours,
sending people fleeing into the
arid scrublands surrounding
the community on Lake Chad.
By Sunday, when government
officials finally felt safe enough
to see the destruction, homes,
businesses and vehicles were
burned throughout the area.
The assault marks a sig-
nificant escalation in the long-
running insurgency Nigeria
faces in its predominantly Mus-
lim north, with Boko Haram
extremists mounting a coordi-
nated assault on soldiers using
military-grade weaponry. The
killings also mark one of the
deadliest incidents ever involv-
ing Boko Haram.
Authorities had found and
buried at least 185 bodies as of
Sunday afternoon, said Lawan
Kole, a local government official
in Baga. He spoke haltingly to
Borno state Gov. Kashim Shet-
tima in the Kanuri language of
Nigeria's northeast, surrounded
by still-frightened villagers.
Officials could not offer a
breakdown of civilian casual-
ties versus those of soldiers and
extremist fighters. Many of the
bodies had been burned beyond
recognition in fires that razed
whole sections of the town, resi-
dents said. Those killed were
buried as soon as possible, fol-
lowing local Muslim tradition.

Brig. Gen. Austin Edokpaye,
also on the visit, did not dispute
the casualty figures. Edokpaye
said Boko Haram extremists
used heavy machine guns and
rocket-propelled grenades in
the assault, which began after
soldiers surrounded a mosque
they believed housed members
of the radical Islamic extremist
network Boko Haram. Extrem-
ists earlier had killed a military
officer, the general said.
Edokpaye said extremists
used civilians as human shields
during the fighting - imply-
ing that soldiers opened fire
in neighborhoods where they
knew civilians lived.
"When we reinforced and
returned to the scene the ter-
rorists came out with heavy
firepower, including (rocket-
propelled grenades), which usu-
ally has a conflagration effect,"
the general said.
However, local residents who
spoke to an Associated Press
journalist who accompanied
the state officials said soldiers
purposefully set the fires during
the attack. Violence by security
forces in the northeast target-
ing civilians has been widely
documented by journalists and
human rights activists. A simi-
lar raid in Maiduguri, Borno
state's capital, in October after
extremists killed a military offi-
cer saw soldiers kill at least 30
civilians and set fires across a
neighborhood.
Sundayafternoon,the burned
bodies of cattle and goats still
filled the streets in Baga. Bullet
holes marred burned buildings.
Fearful residents of the town
had begun packingto leave with
their remaining family mem-
bers before nightfall, despite
Shettima trying to convince
some to stay.
"Everyone has been in the
bush since Friday night; we
started returning back to town
because the governor came to
town today," grocer Bashir Isa

said. "To get food to eat in the
town now is a problem because
even the markets are burnt.
We are still picking corpses of
women and children in the bush
and creeks."
The Islamic insurgency in
Nigeria grew out of a 2009 riot
led by Boko Haram members in
Maiduguri that ended in a mili-
tary and police crackdown that
killed some 700 people. The
group's leader died in police cus-
tody in an apparent execution.
From 2010 on, Islamic extrem-
ists have engaged in hit-and-run
shootings and suicide bombings,
attacks that have killed at least
1,548 people before Friday's
attack, according to an AP count.
In January 2012, Boko Haram
launched a coordinated attack in
Kano, northern Nigeria's largest
city, that killed at leastl185 people
as well. However, casualty num-
bers remain murky in Nigeria,
where security and government
officials often downplay figures.
Boko Haram, which means
"Western education is sacri-
lege" in the Hausa language of
Nigeria's north, has said it wants
its imprisoned members freed
and Nigeria to adopt strict Sha-
riah law across the multiethnic
nation of more than 160 mil-
lion people. While the admin-
istration of President Goodluck
Jonathan has started a commit-
tee to look at the idea of offering
an amnesty deal to extremist
fighters, Boko Haram's leader
Abubakar Shekau has dismissed
the ideaout of hand in messages.
The Boko Haram network,
which analysts and diplomats
say has loose links to two other
al-Qaida-aligned groups in
Africa, has splintered into other
groups as well. Its command-
and-control structure also
remains unclear. Recent Inter-
net videos featuring Shekau
have shown him with fighters
carrying military weapons he
said were stolen during attacks
on Nigeria's military.

On the wrong side of history
Public college requirements should encourage broad learning
bill filed by state Sen. Dan Patrick (R-Houston), aims to
restrict the scope of the six U.S. history credits required
to graduate from a public university in his state. If the bill
passes, students won't be able to satisfy their graduation require-
ments by taking ethnic or cultural history courses and will instead
be forced to choose a history course pertaining to "economy, poli-
tics, war and other significant events" according to a post on Pat-
rick's Facebook page. A case study by the National Association of
Scholars, titled "Recasting History: Is race, class and gender domi-
nating history?" explored the various history courses offered at the
University of Texas and Texas A&M University. Ultimately, it was
this report that motivated Patrick to file the short-sighted bill.

The English language con-
tains a host of words and
phrases meant to brand,
stereotype and
dehumanize.
Chief among
these are the
various labels
set to describe
those who
"lack sufficient
money" - but, JAMES
instead of aptly BRENNAN
describing this
group of people,
we decide to use
words that effectively dehumanize
them. We call them poor, homeless,
destitute, impoverished, in need,
in want, lower-income, lower class,
broke, bankrupt and needy. In real-
ity, "the poor" are just people, albeit
with less money.
Our language, our culture and
our institutions have led to a char-
acterization of indigent people as
not just an underclass, but as dis-
tinctly differenthumanbeings infe-
rior to other members of society.
There's a tendency to describe "the
poor" as lazy, morally bankrupt
and a detriment to society. They're
characterized as criminals, junk-
ies and moochers, looking to make
money only by panhandling or tak-
inggovernment handouts.
These stereotypes are patently
false and insulting to millions of
hard-working people who simply
live under a different set of circum-
stances than some of us. Maybe
most Americans don't overtly think
of indigent people this way, but the
somewhat subconscious, reflexive
way that society stigmatizes "the
poor" - such as the lower prop-
erty values that automatically come
when a neighborhood has several
low-income people living in it - is
extremely harmful.

The research conducted by the NAS seems
to be an overstep, as it marginalizes multicul-
turalism and ethnic studies. Proposing such a
drastic bill requires far more research. This
demonstrates a serious lack in understanding
the value of all types of history. Fundamental
to the study of history is a difference of opin-
ions, debate and case-specific research. The
teaching and learning of history would not
flourish in the restrictive environment this
bill would create.
In 2010, another bill in Texas was passed
making it mandatory for high-school students
to take two of the three social-science courses:
"United States History Studies Since 1877,"
"United States Government" and "Economics
with Emphasis on the Free Enterprise System
and Its Benefits." This structure is very broad
and adequately introduces students to Ameri-
can history before they graduate. Enforcing
Patrick's American history requirements on
college students would be counterproductive
and perhaps repetitive. Students attend col-

lege to expand their knowledge base, and they
should not be restricted to take certain history
classes while barred from others.
Furthermore, if the bill is passed, some
experienced professors who are renowned in
their field of research will be ignored. Classes
such as "History of Mexican Americans in the
U.S." and "The Black Power Movement" that,
according to the NAS report, are being taught
right now at University of Texas and Texas
A&M wouldn't count towards the American
history requirement for students to graduate.
This doesn't only avoid the study of diverse
communities, but this requirement would also
restrict students' options and limit their expo-
sure to a diverse array of topics. What Pat-
rick fails to realize is that these cultural and
ethnic topics are wide-ranging because they
surpass the borders of our nation. Ignoring
ethnic minorities and different cultures isn't
just undervaluing these groups, but denying
students the knowledge and tools they need in
such an intercultural, globalized world.

MAYA MENLO
Justice delayed 1s Justice denied

Imprisoned in aBirmingham jail cell, Mar-
tin LutherKing, Jr. reflected,"Justice too long
delayed is justice denied." Indeed, it's this
exact sentiment that we hold in our hearts
this week as we look forward to both the fifti-
eth anniversary of the March on Washington
for Jobs and Freedom in August, and the two-
year anniversary of the closure of PT Kizone,
an Indonesian factory that produced Adidas
apparel for the University of Michigan.
The Worker Rights Consortium, a labor
watchdog organization, first reported on
Adidas' refusal to pay $1.8 million in legally
owed severance to 2,700 Indonesian workers
soon after the closure of the PT Kizone fac-
tory in April 2011. For two years now, Adidas
hasn't budged on the issue of severance, even
though its contracts with various universi-
ties across the nation - including the Univer-
sity of Michigan - require that Adidas take
responsibility for paying its subcontracted
factory workers legally mandated benefits.
Adidas' intransigence is all the more alarm-
ing when compared to the actions of Nike.
Nike was also producing in PT Kizone at the
time of the factory's closure but, unlike Adi-
das, Nike complied with the WRC's recom-
mendation and agreed to pay $1.5 million in
severance to the former PT Kizone workers.
Denying workers their legally owed sever-
ance pay for two years certainly falls under
King's definition of "justice too long delayed."
With each passing day, the former PT Kizone
workers are continually denied their rights.
And this delayed justice has real consequenc-
es. In a survey conducted by the WRC, 87
percent of former PT Kizone workers report
that since the factory's closure, they have
been unable to afford food that meets their
families' basic nutritional needs. Most have
fallen behind on rent and children's school
fees. When asked how they were dealing with
health care, most workers reported that they
couldn't afford to see any kind ofmedical pro-
fessional and could only buy over-the-coun-
ter medication from a neighborhood vendor.
These are only a few of the laundry list of
hardships former PT Kizone workers face
on a daily basis as a direct result of Adidas'
refusal to pay their legally-owed severance.
Yet, fearless and unwavering workers

and students have matched Adidas' ruth-
less inhumanity with fierce determination.
This week at Adidas headquarters in Ger-
many, PT Kizone workers are delivering a
petition demanding their legally owed sev-
erance signed by nearly a thousand former
workers. This is a campaign of international
proportions; former PT Kizone workers have
joined in solidarity with other Adidas work-
ers across the world, from Honduras to Haiti
to India, to take on the company's sweatshop
supply chain. And the capacity for change is
enormous.
United Students Against Sweatshops, the
national organization spearheading this cam-
paign, knows that, based on past victories,
university actions can force Adidas to change
its ways. In 2009, 25 universities across the
country cut contracts with uniform supplier
Russell Athletic until the company agreed to
re-open a union factory and implement union
neutrality throughout its Honduran plants. In
2010, contract terminations compelled Nike
to pay more than $2 million in severance pay
to 1,800 Honduran garment workers. Today,
the University has the historic opportunity
to be a part of a global movement for brand
responsibility, human rights promotion and
worker solidarity.
United Students Against Sweatshops at
the University of Michigan is demanding
that University President Mary Sue Coleman
stand in solidarity with these workers by cut-
ting ties with Adidas due to the company's
past of worker abuse and negligence of human
rights. Ten universities have already termi-
nated their contracts with Adidas, including
big-name sports schools like the University of
Washington, Pennsylvania State University
and Georgetown University. The University
of Michigan should be next.
Each day the University waits to take
action, another' PT Kizone worker's fam-
ily falls deeper into debt and poverty. As this
week marks the two-year anniversary of Adi-
das' workers struggle for justice, USAS asks
University President Mary Sue Coleman to
recall MLK's words, and to cut ties with Adi-
das over its flagrant denial of justice.

Whenever anything note-
worthy happens in rela-
tion to the University,
someone out -
there is certain
to tweet about it
and tack on the
obligatory #the-
michigandiffer-
ence.
As of late, The
Michigan Dif-
ference's online HEMA
presence has KARUNA-
been reduced KARA
to sophomoric
tales such as "fed
a squirrel on the Diag" or "chugged
four Natty Lights before 8 a.m. on a
football Saturday." Originally start-
ed as a marketing and fundraising
campaign, the real intention of The
Michigan Difference is to highlight
the great impact that Michigan's
students, faculty and staff have in
the world.
Since the campaign was launched
in 2005, these three words have
been used (and misused) every-
where to set the bar for achieve-
ment and success among everyone
on this campus. From the moment
freshmen set foot in the Carl Milles
Fountain outside the Michigan
League during orientation, they are
expected to become a part of The
Michigan Difference. In fact, just
getting in to this University means
they already are The Michigan Dif-
ference. And every internship or
job they get where they beat out
the rest of the crowd helps them be
The Michigan Difference. And once
they graduate, they'll be a part of
the largest alumni network in the
world - that is, The Michigan Dif-
ference. And one day, they'll join
the ranks of Gerald Ford, Arthur
Miller and James Earl Jones as they
make a positive impact on soci-
ety and they'll have achieved The
Michigan Difference.
While in all fairness I feel
extremely proud and honored to be
a Wolverine whenever I hear such
great tales, I have to wonder if we
set the bar too high. The Michigan
Difference undoubtedly exists, but

especially for a cause so easy to
rally around.
"It's something where when
you're dealing with hun-
dreds of thousands of dollars
... you know the difference
that you're making," she said.
"Putting on a 24-hour event is
like nothing else, it's one-of-a-
kind."
In addition to Knysh, there
are about 70 other students on
the planning committee, includ-
ing 20 directors who have been
planning the event for more
than a year. Knysh said plans
for next year's event are already
under way.

MRelay partnered with
Kaplan Test Prep to fund the
event. Local businesses, includ-
ing Domino's, Pizza Hut and
Chipotle, also donated lunch to
the participants.
LSA sophomore Michael
Miller, Relay for Life chair
for the University's chapter
of the Sigma Chi Fraternity,
wrote in an e-mail that he
had never realized the impor-
tance of the cause before this
year, previously believing it
was only a way to raise money
and awareness about cancer.
He said his favorite part of
the event was the Luminaria
Ceremony.
"I literally was able to see the
community of the University
come together and remember

the reason we were all there,"
Miller said. "It was definitely
a moment I will remember for-
ever."
LSA sophomores Kristin
Soreide and Erin Farley, mem-
bers of University Students Act-
ing Against Cancer, said they far
exceeded their personal fun-
draising goal of $2,500 for the
event.
"My dad passed away when I
was in second grade ... so I like
to fight and be here for Relay
for Life to help other people
not lose their parents," Sore-
ide said. "It's a fun way to raise
money."
"Everybody in some way or
form is affected by cancer,"
Farley added. "It's a great
cause."

said the Image Awards provide
the opportunity to dress up and
celebrate other students as a cap-
stone to the academic year.
"This event is really impor-
tant because it celebrates our
achievements , through com-
munity service, academics and
involvement in the black com-
munity," Hemby said.
Nominated for the Ida B.
Wells sophomore award, Hemby
attended the event for the sec-
ond time Sunday. Like the other
nominated students, Hemby is
active in many organizations
including Kappa Omega Alpha
pre-law fraternity and the Big
Ten Network and serving as

secretary of the Black Student
Union.
"The other nominees are just
as involved as I am," Hemby
said. "Even if I don't win it, I'm
still proud of them."
Between award presentations
bearing the names of historic
figures such as civil rights lead-
ers Martin Luther King Jr. and
Supreme Court Justice Clarence
Thomas, musical performances
punctuated the evening. The
Black National Anthem, "Lift
Every Voice and Sing," brought
the crowd to its feet.
Interpretive dancer Devon
Jones, paused between melo-
dies - including a song by pop
artist Bruno Mars - to offer
life lessons to the audience.
Reflecting on the award night,
Jones reminded nominees that

the plaques did not represent a
culmination, but rather a begin-
ning.
"Success is not a destination,"
Jones said.
The ceremony also included
a tribute to University political
science Prof. Walton Hanes, Jr.,
who passed away earlier this
year. Elizabeth James and Ron-
ald Woods, both Afroamerican
and African Studies professors,
lauded Hanes' work in advanc-
ing the study of Civil-Rights-era
politics.
James also noted that the
University produced more
black political scientists than
any other institution in the
nation due to Hanes' mentoring
efforts.
"He was authentic, as only a
superhero can be."

Susan Pile, director of the
Michigan Union, said in a state-
ment that Ahmo's will bring
more variety and healthy options
to MUG.
"As we looked back on our
partnership with Ahmo's at
Pierpont Commons this past
year, we have been impressed
with their dedication to cus-
tomer service and healthy offer-
ings," Pile said. "We know this
long-standing Ann Arbor opera-
tor has been a popular destina-
tion and we're excited to bring
a new location to this part of
campus."
Wendy's and Subway are

Organizers of the event includ-
ed Parikh; LSA freshman Tanner
Waterstreet, the co-chair of the
CSG External Relations Commis-
sion; LSA junior Jill Clancy, the
CSG chief programming officer;
and LSA freshman Nick Swider, a
CSG intern.
Waterstreet said he would like
to see this event, as well as other
community service events, resur-
face in the future.
The future of community
service through CSG received
another boost as the incoming
CSG president and vice president,
Business junior Mike Proppe and
LSA sophomore Bobby Dishell
attended the event.
"I think service projects like

efficient service. Wendy's will
also update its food preparation
and add a Coca-Cola Freestyle
machine, a soda fountain that
allows customers to customize
their drink orders with more
than 100 soft drink flavor com-
binations.
Adam Kleven, chair of the
Michigan Union Board of rep-
resentatives, said in a statement
that Subway and Wendy's allow
students a variety of options
at reasonable prices. He added
that student feedback made it
clear that an American-style
restaurant needed to stay in the
Union.
In addition to the new res-
taurants, the release announced
renovations to MUG beginning
May 5. The renovations are
expected to update the operat-
ing spaces of the restaurants
and improve the seating area.
While the area is undergoing
renovations, guest operators
this are something that student
government should probably do a
little bit more of (and) hasn't done
a lot of in the past," Proppe said,
adding that he's already talked
with CSG's Peace and Justice
Commission about doing more
service projects.
Dishell said it's important to
be thankful for a city that does so
much for its student residents.
Parikh said several student
groups were partners in the
event, including the African Stu-
dents Association, Smile Bringer
Singers, Michigan Izzat, Michi-
gan Club Wrestling and buildOn.
All involved students were split
among the seven sites.
LSA sophomore Benjamin Far-
rell and LSA senior Chloe Prince
were two of the volunteers at Gal-
lup Park. Both said they heard of
the event through the campus-

will provide food service on the
first floor.
"I like Mediterranean food,
but it sucks that they're taking
out more than one restaurant,"
LSA freshman Saba Keramati
said.
"I like Mediterranean food,
but the pretzels are my favor-
ite," LSA freshman Ryan
McDonough said. "I'll be open
minded, but I'm not happy about
it."
LSA freshmen Nisha Gopal
has never been to Ahmo's, but
said she might try it since she
comes to the Union so often.
Gopal also said that she thinks
a lot of people would have been
upset if Panda Express was
replaced.
"I'll definitely miss Mrs.
Fields," Gopal said, "but thank
God they're keeping Subway."

wide e-mail that Parikh sent.
Prince said she likes to run
through Ann Arbor parks and
saw the opportunity as a way to
say thanks.
"For me, I'm a senior here. The
e-mail (invitation) was framed
as a way to give back to the Ann
Arbor I've enjoyed over the
last four years," Prime said. "I
thought the least I can do is help
clean up."
Farrell is an Ann Arbor native.
He used to come to Gallup Park
with his father while growing
up, but it had been years since
he'd been there last. He said he
was glad that student leaders
were supportive of keeping the
city clean.
"It's good to have people at the
school that are thinking about
things like this because someone
needs to."


BOSTON
From Page 1A
who ran in the April 15 Boston
Marathon. They logged a com-
bined 543 miles.
Schneidewind said the call for
the event was natural because
running has a feel of community
and camaraderie absent from
any other sport.
"When people run in races,
it's not a competition; typically,
you are trying to beat your own
time," Schneidewind said. "Run-
ners don't feel badly about helping
each other during a race or cheer-
ing for one another because they
just want to see everyone do well."
In Boston, runners were a part
of an inseparable community. The

community showed itself to be
tight-knit in Ann Arbor as well,
Schneidewind said.
"Part of the people that will
show up today will do so because
they saw runners in Boston going
through something difficult and
it resonated with them," he said.
"They wanted to stand up for
their running brethren."
Many University students par-
ticipated in-the run. LSA-fresh--
men Grace Carbeck - who has
family in Boston - and Mike
Lokey said they were running in
memory and support of everyone
in Boston who were victims or
witnesses of the violence.
Ann Arbor resident Lindy Alfa-
ro said as she ran, she was keep-
ing in mind friends who ran in
the Boston Marathon or lived on

the campus of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, which
was the location of a police offi-
cer's death Thursday night.
"After everything they've gone
through, we're showing that we
support them," Alfaro said with
tears in her eyes. "People who
run Boston usually work so hard
all year to train for it, and to
have such a tragic event happen
and- have people get hurt is just
unthinkable."
Schneidewind said Saturday's
event would show that, despite
the disaster in Boston, Americans
are resilient in face of terror.
"This is not going to be some-
thing that is divisive or makes
people turn on each other, but
it'll be something that brings us
together."

Presidential candidate Horacio Cartes greets supporters after election results were made official in Asuncion, Paraguay,
April 21. Cartes won a five-year term with 46 percent of the vote.
Tobacco tycoon elected as
president of Paraguay


Colorado Party
retakes power
executive office
ASUNCION, Paraguay
(AP) - Paraguayans elected a
tobacco magnate as their new
leader Sunday, returning the
conservative Colorado Party to
the presidency that it held for
61 years before former Roman
Catholic bishop Fernando Lugo
won the office in 2008.
Horacio Cartes won a five-
year term with 46 percent of
the vote over 37 percent for
Efrain Alegre of the Radical
Liberal party, the Electoral
Court announced after most
votes were counted. Five other
candidates trailed far behind.
"I'll need help from all the
Paraguayans to govern in the
next five years. Poverty, the
lack of jobs for young people
and international issues await
us," Cartes said Sunday night.
Poverty is widespread in
Paraguay, which is an agrarian
nation that is South America's
No. 3 producer of soy, corn and
sunflowers. About 1 percent
of the population controls 77
percent of the arable land. The
U.N. estimates more than half
of Paraguayans live in pover-
ty, while the country's census
bureau puts the number at 39
percent.
Alegre recognized his defeat
despite saying earlier that he
might challenge the outcome.
"The Paraguayan people have
spoken. There's nothing more
to say," he said in a brief conces-
sion speech.
Cartes, 58, is part of the tiny
elite that controls just about
everything in Paraguay. His
father represented the Cessna

airplane company in Paraguay,
which enabled Cartes to get
schooling in the U.S. state of
Oklahoma.
The president-elect owns
controlling shares in banks,
investment funds, agricultur-
al estates, a soda mtaker and
tobacco plantations. Most pre-
election polls predicted his vic-
tory, despite this being his first
run for public office. Cartes has
been well-known in Paraguay
as president of Libertad, the
club that won last year's nation-
al soccer championship.
Many Paraguayans hope
this election will encour-
age other countries to restore
full relations that were sus-
pended after last year's
impeachment of Lugo, which
neighboring nations saw as
a threat to democracy in the
region.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate
Oscar Arias led an observer
mission from the Organization
of American States, and said
Sunday that he had complete
confidence in the Electoral
Court because it had spent
months observing and support-
ing the process. There were 515
observers from the OAS, Euro-
pean Union, the Union of South
American Nations regional bloc
known as UNASUR and the
Union of Latin American Elec-
toral Organizations.
International election
observer Martin Sequeira
said voting proceeded calmly
with a high turnout. He said
there were some unconfirmed
reports of election fraud com-
plaining that some ballots had
been pre-marked.
But Arias said those were
only "some small incidents,
which you see even in the most
consolidated democracies."

The Colorados held the pres-
idency during and after Alfredo
Stroessner's 35-year-dictator-
ship, until Lugo, a leftist, san-
dal-wearing former bishop,
joined up with the Radical Lib-
erals and was swept into office
on promises of land reform. But
Lugo lacked even a handful of
supporters in congress, made
political missteps within his
own coalition and was stymied
at every turn.
The Radical Liberals finally
joined with the Colorados to
vote Lugo out of office for "poor
performance" last year. The
impeachment process is well
defined under the constitution,
but Paraguay's neighbors criti-
cized the ouster of a popularly
elected president as anti-demo-
cratic and suspended the coun-
try's membership in UNASUR,
the Mercosur trade bloc and
CELAC, which brings together
Caribbean, Latin American and
European Union countries.
Lugo's vice president, Fed-
erico Franco, a Radical Lib-
eral politician who took over
as caretaker president, said he
expects Paraguay's status to
be swiftly normalized after the
new head of state takes office
Aug.15.
Turnout was more than 68
percent among the estimated
3.5 million of Paraguay's 6.2
million citizens who are regis-
tered to vote. They elected 45
senators, 80 deputies, 17 gov-
ernors and 18 delegates to the
Mercosur parliament based in
Uruguay.
Millions more eligible voters
live outside Paraguay, but after
a poorly funded registration
process, fewer than 22,000
people were registered, most
in Argentina, Spain and the
United States.

Six police officers, three
civilians killed by Taliban

April already the
deadliest month of
year in Afghanistan
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -
Insurgents killed six police offi-
cers at a checkpoint and a suicide
bomber killed three civilians
at a shopping bazaar in sepa-
rate attacks Sunday in eastern
Afghanistan, while an indepen-
dent security group warned 2013
is on track to be one of the most
violent years of the war.
April already has been the
deadliest month this year for
security forces and Afghan and
foreign civilians as the U.S. and
other countries prepare to end
their combat mission by the end
of next year. According to an
Associated Press tally, 222 peo-
ple have been killed in violence
around the nation this month,
including Sunday's nine fatali-
ties.
The Taliban ambushed the
checkpoint in the Dayak dis-
trict of Ghazni province, killing
six police officers, wounding
one and leaving one missing,
said Col. Mohammad Hussain,
deputy provincial police chief.
The checkpoint was manned
by Afghan local police, forces
recruited at the village level that
are nominally under the control

of the Afghan Interior Ministry.
On Friday, Taliban insur-
gents attacked a local police
checkpoint in Andar, a district
of Ghazni province neighboring
Dayak. They killed 13 officers,
according to Sidiq Sidiqi, the
Interior Ministry spokesman.
The second attack on Sunday
hit Paktika province, which bor-
ders Ghazni. A suicide bomber
detonated his explosives in a
shopping bazaar around midday,
killing three people and wound-
ing five civilians and two police
officers, said Mokhlis Afghan,
the spokesman for the provincial
governor. Among the dead was
Asanullah Sadat, who stepped
down as the district's governor
two years ago.
Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokes-
man for Taliban, claimed respon-
sibility for the suicide bombing.
In an email to reporters, he said
the Taliban used the bomber to
target Sadat because of his close
relations with the Afghan gov-
ernment and the U.S.
In other violence, the Tali-
ban cut a hand and foot off each
of two villagers they accused of
helping escort coalition convoys,
a spokesman for the provincial
chief in western Herat province
said.
Noor Khan Nekzad said the
men were admitted to a hospital
in Herat city on Sunday. two days

after the amputations. The Tali-
ban have long killed government
employees and those who help
the coalition, considering them
enemy collaborators, but rarely
have they meted out punishment
by cuttingoff limbs.
Hostilities have surged in
Afghanistan as the spring fight-
ing season begins. This year is
being closely watched because
Afghan forces must operate with
less support from the interna-
tional military coalition. With
foreign forces due to hand over
combat responsibilities to the
local forces next year, the current
fighting is a test of their ability to
take on the country's insurgency.
Reflecting the rise in blood-
shed, the Afghanistan NGO
Safety Office said Sunday there
were 2,331 insurgent-initiated
attacks in the first quarter of
this year, a 47 percent increase
over the same January-March
period last year. "We assess that
the current re-escalation trend
will be preserved throughout
the entire season and that 2013
is set to become the second most.
violent year after 2011," which
suffered 2,755 such attacks in the
firstthree months oftheyear, the
report said.
The U.S.-led NATO coalition
has stopped releasing statistics
on insurgent attacks in Afghani-
stan.

He said police had no motive
for the gunfire.
Witnesses described a scene
in which a jovial atmosphere
quickly turned to one of panic
at the downtown Civic Center
Park just before 5 p.m. Several
thought firecrackers were being
set off, then a man fell bleeding,
his dog also shot.
"I saw him fall, grabbing his
leg," said Travis Craig, 28, who
was at the celebration, saw the
shooting and said he used a
belt to apply a tourniquet to the
man's leg.
"He was just screaming that
he was in pain, and wanted to
know where his girlfriend was.
She was OK. And then the cops
showed up real quick, like, less
than a minute. They put him on
ambulance and left."
The annual pot celebration
this year was expected to draw
as many as 80,000 people after
recent laws in Colorado and
Washington made marijuana
legal for recreational use.
A sizable police force on
motorcycles and horses had
been watching the celebration
since its start earlier Saturday.
But authorities, who generally
look the other way at public pot
smoking here on April 20, didn't
arrest people for smoking in
public, which is still illegal.
Police said earlier in the week
that they were focused on crowd
security in light of attacks that
killed three at the finish line of
the Boston Marathon.
"We're aware of the events
in Boston," said Denver police
spokesman Aaron Kafer, who
declined to give specifics about
security measures being taken.
"Our message to the public is
that, if you see something, say
something."
Stephanie Riedel, who trav-
eled to the pot celebration from
Pittsburgh, said she was danc-
ing with a hula hoop when she
heard pops. A man ran past her,
then she said the crowd started
screaming and running away.
She was about 20 feet from the
shooting and heard four or five
shots.
"I couldn't make sense of
what it was at first," she said.
"We were all having a good time
and I was in the mindframe of,
we're here at a peace gathering.
I thought it some guys playing."j
Rapper LUP Flip was per-1
forming when the shootings
occurred.
Aerial footage showed the
massive crowd frantically run-
ning from the park.
Ian Bay, who was skate-
boarding through Civic Center
Park when shots erupted, said
he was listening to music on his
headphones when he looked to
his right and saw a swarm of
hundreds of people running at
him.
"I sort of panicked. I thought
I was going through an anxiety
thing because so many people
were coming after me," he said.
Before the shooting, reggae
music filled the air, and so did
the smell of marijuana, as cele-
brants gathered by mid-morning
in the park just beside the state
Capitol.
Group smoke-outs were
planned Saturday from New

York to San Francisco. The ori-
gins of the number "420" as a
code for pot are murky, but the
drug's users have for decades
marked the date 4/20 asa day to
use pot together.

with charac-

tangents and original insights.
"Silence of the Lambs" (1991)
and "Memento" (2000) embody
this formula to perfection. They
confound and trip you up with-
out ever losing grip of your mini
attention span. "Trance" follows
the formula, too, but inflates its
details to overcapacity.
Director Danny Boyle ("127
Hours") is no stranger to the
collective audience gasp and
cringe - think of the dead baby
crawling on the ceiling in his
"Trainspotting." He disrupts
any predictability in your emo-
tions, as he did through his zom-
bies in the scary-as-hell "28 Days
Later" or the nerve-ripper, "127
Hours." If you consider yourself
unfeeling, Boyle will quash your
streak. "Trance" allows him
to enter an increasingly perti-
nent realm in these digital days:
obsession.
Simon is an art auctioneer
(James McAvoy, "X-Men: First
Class"), and his secrets used to
haunt him. Now, he's golden and
has forgotten the dirty past. In
the event of a highly efficient
heist to steal a priceless Goya
painting, Simon's ready to dodge
the bullet. During his getaway,
he receives a hard bludgeon
to the brainpan - effectively
unerasing certain erased memo-
ries. In other words, his brain
goes berserk. Captured by the
criminals, Simon is forced to
sign up to see a shrink to hope-
fully unearth where he hid the
Goya.
Immediately, Simon and his
therapist Elizabeth (Rosario
Dawson, "Zookeeper") share
an inexplicable bond, as if they
had once known each other.
Eventually, Elizabeth catches
on to the antics of Simon and
confirms she "wants in" on the
deal: extract the memory imag-
es inside Simon to lead them to
the painting. Simple, right?
Simon's thought patterns
inundate themselves with imag-
es of Elizabeth, not the paint-

Judging people based on the
content of their TV characters

By RADHIKA MENON
Daily Arts Writer
If within five minutes of
meeting me you reveal that
you love "Friday Night Lights,"
chances are I will pronounce
you my newly christened BFF.
The same goes for "30 Rock,"
"Breaking Bad" and "Lost," to
name a few others. But if you
even mention "Two and a Half
Men" around me, you can get
out of my face.
I tend to judge people based
on their taste in television.
I don't even feel catty about
doing it - it's my chosen win-
dow into one's soul. Television
is a growing medium that con-
tinuously churns out some of
the best visual content. So, if
you're watching shitty televi-
sion, that's your own fault. You
will be scrutinized.
It was a cold winter day last
January when I was hanging
out with my friend in his apart-
ment. Bundled beneath blan-
kets, he turned the TV on and

his eyes lit up when they landed
on the words "The Big Bang
Theory" in the guide.
My eyes rolled deeply within
their sockets.
What followed was the most
boring 30 minutes of television
I have ever had to endure, and I
wouldn't wish it upon my worst
enemy. As that dull half hour
dragged on, I found myself not
laughing. That's fine - the show
isn't for everyone. But I realized
that every time he laughed, I
scoffed and prayed for the show
to end, both right now and per-
manently. "How does he like
this crap?" I wondered. And as
his laughs piled up, my annoy-
ance did, too.
I left his apartment that
day with uneasiness about the
future of our friendship. If he
could laugh at a Chuck Lorre
creation, could I really continue
to respect him? If he didn't find

Every year on April 15, every

The new film AtQualityl6

izes Robinson Wamer Bros
by translating
his story to the big screen.
So ... why hadn't this movie
been made before? (Aside from
the 1950 film "The Jackie Rob-
inson Story," which starred
Jackie Robinson as himself.)
As frequently as Hollywood
capitalizes on inspirational true
stories ("Argo," "A Beautiful
Mind" - even crappy ones like
"Dolphin Tale"), it's surprising
that over 60 years have passed,
and we're just now getting a big-
budget film about true American
hero, Jackie Robinson.
"42" chronicles Jackie Robin-
son's journey from the second-
rate fields of the Negro Leagues
through the minor-league
system and all the way to the
Brooklyn Dodgers, becoming
the first black man to play in the
MLB. All the while, Robinson
(Chadwick Boseman, TV's "All
My Children") deals with the
hardship and turmoil of break-
ing racial barriers in a country
filled with people not ready to
let a black man share their bath-
rooms, let alone play the game
they love.
In his first starring role, Bose-

portray Robinson believably:

It takes the better part of one

you're most likely frustrated
by a screenplay that needlessly

almost as if the characters are
being made to repeat the same
lines in different ways. The pac-
ing is strongly reminiscent of
director Joseph Kosinski's pre-
vious venture, "Tron: Legacy"
and, at times, serves as an excel-
lent cure for sleep deprivation.
Despite being pinned down
by a paper-thin script, the two
female leads, Kuyrlenko and
Riseborough, manage to deliv-
er memorable performances
as Harper's love interests. The
man himself, Tom Cruise, turns
in a restrained performance,
which is at its best in the film's
quietest moments that see
Harper spending time alone
with what's left of the planet.
Due to poor pacing, the
majority of the film is left as an
exercise in patience and atten-

Men's gymnastics
I takes national title
by widest margin in
29 years
By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Writer
Going into the final rotation
of the NCAA national champi-
onship on Saturday night, the
Michigan men's gymnastics team

held a half-point lead over Okla-
homa with only its floor routine
to go. But while the Sooners and
the other four teams were anx-
iously waiting to begin their last
event rotations, the Wolverines
couldn't help but smile.
No. 3 Michigan (7-1 Big Ten,
27-2 overall) was up on the floor,
where it ranks first in the nation,
and knew it was only a rotation
awayfromwinningthe program's
fifth national championship.
But the anticipation of winning
wasn't the only thing bringing

smiles to the Wolverine bench.
Junior Sam Mikulak was up by
2.95 points in the all-around com-
petition over his teammate, soph-
omore Adrian de Los Angeles. So
with first and second place locked
up in the all-around, a huge floor
routine was all that stood in
Michigan's way to a team title.
The Wolverines did more than
rise to the occasion on their floor
exercise, where they scored an
event-high 75.250, which gave
them a 443.200-440.100 blowout
over the second-place Sooners.

It's been 29 years since a team
won the NCAA team titleby more
than three points.
"I knew we could score higher
on floor then Oklahoma could
on high bar, we just had to hit
our sets," said Michigan coach
Kurt Golder. "But it can happen
where one guy misses, then the
next guy, then the next guy, and it
can be really hard to get it turned
around.
"We didn't have it clinched
(and) even though we had the
pressure on us, the guys were

ready for it and handled it really
well."
Michigan's success on floor
also kept Mikulak in the lead for
the all-around championship,
where he ultimately edged out Los
Angeles with a career-best 91.150.
It's Mikulak's second all-around
title in three years, and the pairs'
1-2 finish for the all-around is the
first time teammates have done
that since the 1980s.
"Mikulak is special because of
his unselfishness," Golder said.
"Every interview that he has, he

just talks about how he didn't
have personal goals and (that)
everything was for the team. He
kept saying all he wanted was to
get one or two in the all-around
no matter the order, (just) as long
as it went to Michigan.
"He just wanted the team to
win, and that approach was really
great - just get out there and be
the best."
All in all, it was a storybook
weekend for the Wolverines, who
started out as well as they fin-

Wolverines extend streak to 21 games

Softball sweeps
Iowa to extend the
nation's longest
winning streak
By ERIN LENNON
Daily Sports Writer
Whether it's winning by 10 in
five innings or with a comeback
rally in the sixth, one thing is cer-
tain: the No. 9 Michigan softball
team has forgotten how to lose.
A three-game sweep of Iowa
tied a program record for con-
secutive
wins in the IOWA 3
Big Ten MICHIGAN 5
(16) and
extended IOWA 6
the Wolver-
ines' win- IOWA 0
ning streak MICHIGAN 8
to 21 - the
longest in the country.
When a 2-1 change-up pitch
from Iowa right-hander Chel-
sea Lyon was called for a strike,
freshman Sierra Romero gri-
maced, knowing she had let her
pitch get by. Romero took a big
swing at the next pitch, but the
result was nothing more than her

first strikeout in conference play
this season.
The first inning was the last
time that Romero and the Wol-
verines (16-0 Big Ten, 39-7 over-
all) would be frustrated in the
doubleheader on Sunday.
With two outs in the bottom
of the second inning, sophomore
catcher Lauren Sweet drove her
fifth home run of the season over
the left-field wall to put the Wol-
verines up 3-0. Hitting from the
nine spot in place of her usual
lead-off position, junior center-
fielder Lindsay Doyle continued
the two-out hitting with a line
drive to center but was caught
stealing to end the inning.
Two walks and a single loaded
the bases for freshman left fielder
Sierra Lawrence in the bottom
of the third inning. Lawrence -
hitting from the cleanup spot in
the lineup for the first time this
season - drove the second pitch
of the at-bat over the wall. Again,
Sweet extended the inning with a
two-out single to right.
The Hawkeyes answered in
the top of the fourth, silenc-
ing the crowd with two straight
home runs to centerfield off of
sophomore left-hander Haylie
Wagner. In the fifth, Iowa short-
stop Megan Blank drilled a three-

run home run into the right-field
bleachers, cutting the Wolverine
lead to just three.
Sophomore pitcher Sara Dri-
esenga entered the circle for the
Wolverines in the sixth in relief of
Wagner. Holding onto a two-run
lead with two outs and the bases
loaded in the top of the seventh,
Driesenga came through with a
strikeout to complete the two-
pitcher effort and the win.
In the second game of the dou-
bleheader, Michigan opted to end
early.
Hutchins was forced to take
an early trip to the mound in the
top of the first inning after Dries-
enga found herself with runners
on first and third with one out.
She was bailed out by junior first
baseman Caitlin Blanchard, who
threw a grounder to Sweet for
the tag out at home. Like she had
in game one, Driesenga recorded
a strikeout to escape the inning
unscathed.
But without further ado,
Romero drove a pitch off the
scoreboard in left field. With her
19th home run, the freshman
became the sole conference lead-
er in totalbases, hits, runs scored,
home runs and RBI.
"She could play for the Tigers,"
Hutchins told Big Ten Network.

"She has some of the quickest
hands in Michigan softball his-
tory."
A .583 hitter in bases-loaded
situations, Blanchard stepped up
to the plate in the bottom of the
third inning with an opportunity
to crack the game open. She did
just that with a single into right
field and two more singles put the
Wolverines up 5-0 with one out.
After a solo shot from senior
second baseman Ashley Lane put
Michigan up 7-0 in the bottom of
the fifth inning, Hutchins sent
freshman utility player Kelsey
Susalla in to pinch hit. Susalla
came just shy of her fifth home
run in two weeks but settled for
her first career triple off of the
right-field wall. The Wolverines
completed their eighth mercy-
rule victory in conference play.
On Saturday, Michigan played
comeback against the.Hawkeyes,
etchingout a 5-3 win.
Trailing 2-1 in the bottom of
the sixth on Saturday, the Wol-
verines did what they do best: bat
around.
After consecutive walks to
Romero - who had a home run
in the second inning - and senior
second baseman Ashley Lane,
Blanchard extended her hitting

One last time, an overdue story for Papa

The other day, my father, a
French and Spanish teacher,
looked down at his precise cursive
scrawl, chuckled, and shook his
head. His pen still hovered above
a student's paper, above his signa-
ture: Stephen
J. Nesbitt.
Except, he
is Stephen M.
Nesbitt.
He later
admitted his
gaffe and
said it was a STEPHEN J
humiliating S
sign of being NESBITT
eclipsed by
his children.
I smiled. That couldn't be further
from the truth.
This was always Papa's dream,
this sportswriting.
A tall, lanky kid from Birming-
ham, Mich., he went to Michigan
State to be a sports reporter. He
had the know-how, he knew how
to crafta story, and he certainly
had the writing talent.
But there, in the shadows of
Spartan Stadium, he reversed
course. He'd say his motivation
was ill-founded. He'd say he was
in it for the wrong reasons. He'd
say his pursuit was only of the
opportunity to meet famous ath-
letes and to tell their stories.
So, he left East Lansing,
instead, with a French degree to
become a teacher. He met Brenda
Knopf, they married, and their
adventure quickly took them far,
far away from where either of
them had imagined.
In 1984, with 1-year-old Steph-
anie in tow, my parents moved
to France to become evangelical
Christian missionaries. Daniel
was born in 1987, followed two
years later byDavid, followed two
years later by Peter, who was fol-
lowed seven minutes later by me.
In total, my parents would
spend 13 years there in northern
France, working tirelessly to
spread a gospel of love and grace
and truth as they raised a family
thousands and thousands of miles
away from Michigan, from their

home.
Home for me was never Michi-
gan, though. Home wasn't any-
thing like Michigan.
My home was in northern
France, in the Somme region,
where fields and grasslands were
stitched together likea patchwork
quilt, where memorials and cem-
eteries and craters were everyday
reminders of the battles fought in
those same fields during World
War I.
Home was Lille, then Har-
gicourt, and then ipehy. Home
was ared-brick farmhouse that
somehow fit all of us and a golden
retriever under the same roof;
home was a wiffle-ball field,
bomb casings and bayonets in the
backyard, fool's gold rocks in the
driveway, and six acres of land
littered with sheep, chickens and
turkeys on the north end of town.
But that was simply the back-
drop. The life of this story was in
our home. There is nothing better
than growing up in a house brim-
ming with laughter and children.
But, in time, the novelty of a
large family began to fade for
some. After receiving some criti-
cism from a number of financial
supportersback in the United
States, my parents dropped the
official title of missionary soon
after their 10th anniversary, and
they severed all financial support.
Now, contrary to popular
belief, being "professional Chris-
tians" in the first place doesn't
exactly align with a life of riches.
Not at all, actually. Papa found
work teaching English courses
at the chamber of commerce in
nearby St. Quentin, then he start-
ed working as a sporting-goods
salesman.
Rachel was born in 1993, fol-
lowed two years later by Eliza-
beth, followed two years later by
Carol.
We lived meager paycheck to
meager paycheck. We first drove
a yellow Volkswagen van, then a
small, grey sedan, then no car at
all, and then my dad's white sales
truck. We faltered, but we never
fell.
Mama, our rock, never left
the table empty. When zucchini
from our garden was all we had to

eat, that's what we ate. Zucchini
bread for breakfast; zucchini and
squash salad for lunch; zucchini
pasta for dinner.
There wasn't always much, but
there was something on the table,
and there was family around it.
It was a happy and healthy and
bustling home. What more could a
kid ask for?
I learned faith. I learned work
ethic. I learned sacrifice.
And I learned sports, of course.
Even in a land where soccer
and soccer alone rules the sports
world, Papa's love for sports, espe-
cially for baseball, became his
sons' love.
Every night, we played wiffle
ball in the backyard. Every Sat-
urday duringthe baseball season,
we'd drive an hour northeast,
across the Belgian border, to the
city of Mons and its sprawling
NATO base - Supreme Head-
quarters Allied Powers Europe
(S.H.A.P.E.) - for baseball. We
played on the Belgian team
against all the Americans since
our dad wasn't in the military.
And, at long last, Papa tried
his hand again at sportswriting.
He began writing, designing and
producing The European Baseball
Report, a baseball magazine tar-

geted at spreading the popularity
of baseball in the region.
My first venture into journal-
ism, I suppose, was at the dining-
room table, as I helped fold the
magazines, slide them into their
envelopes and lick the envelopes
closed.
But Papa's sportswriting career
finished almost before it started.
We movedback "home."
We moved to Marlette, Mich.
in Oct. 1998 to help my grandfa-
ther take care of my ailing grand-
mother as she reached the final
stages of her battle with Alzheim-
er's. We moved home for exactly
the right reason, but it wasn't easy
to accept. Gone was the pastoral
French countryside. Gone were
the sheep and the chickens. Gone
was home as I knew it.
But Papa couldn't find a teach-
ing job nearby, so he did what he'd
always done - he found a way
to make it work. Despite owning
a Masters degree in curriculum
development, he worked for a
full year at two milking parlors.
Twelve-hour shifts, minimum
wage, and he'd never even get so
much asa hug afterward - but
not because we didn't miss him.
It was because he'd come home,
exhausted, with his black jacket

splattered with manure.
Still, he found time to ferry us
to baseball games, near and far,
and to coach from the third-base
box whenever he could.
Bethany was born in 2000.
That year, the Nesbitts, a family of
11, survived on $10,000, faith, and
a lot of prayers.
This sportswriting was always
his dream. I've just been fortu-
nate enough to have lived it out
these lastcfour years.
A tall, lanky kid from Grand
Ledge, Mich., I went to Michi-
gan to bea news reporter, to do
something vigilant and important
and different, but I couldn't steer
myself away from the sports sec-
tion. I was told that I had the
know-how, that I knew how to
craft a story, and that I had the
writingltalent.
But there in the shadows of
Michigan Stadium, I nearly
reversed course. I worried my
motivation was misguided. I
worried I was in it for the wrong
reasons. I worried my pursuit was
only of the opportunity to meet
famous athletes and to tell their
stories.
But as I watched Denard Rob-
inson fumble, recover, then gallop
for a touchdown in my first game
at the Big House, I knew I was
in the right place. I stayed the
course.
I found The Michigan Daily,
and 420 Maynard became my
home. I found my best friends
here. I found an education and a
career here. I found my passion
here.
Here, I learned that everyone
has a story, a beautifullyunique
storyto tell. Sometimes, though,
people don't understand the
weight and gravity oftheir story
until they finally tell it, until they
chip away the layers bitby bit,
until they see it spelled out in
front of them.
I've told Maureen Moody's
story. Her father never missed a
moment as Maureen grew up, but
terminal metastatic pancreatic
cancer stole him awayat the start
of her senior season.

I've told Dave Molk's story. He
cried in Schembechler Hall as he
told me memories of his mother
who died a decade earlier. It was
a story he'd never told before,
something he never liked to think
about, but he let me in. The story
almostnever ran. It was sensi-
tive; it was personal. But, in the
end, it went to print. "I'm glad I
agreed to this story," he wrote in
an email. "More importantly, I
waited for the right reporter."
And I've told Denard Rob-
inson's story. The soft-spoken
quarterback told of his journey to
escape the danger of the streets in
his hometown of Deerfield Beach,
Fla. He told of his humiliation
when college coaches came on in-
home visits. He told of his brother
Timothy's death and of his own
dream to become the first college
graduate in his family.
If I getto tell people's stories
for the rest of my life, I'll be a
happy man.
But there was one story I
wanted to tell while I still had
the chance. It's the story of an
aspiring journalist, someone
who wanted to meet the rich and
famous, who wanted, to some
extent, to be known. It's the story
of a man who always did things
the right way, who always fought
to keep his family together. It's
the story of a teacher, an expert
in a selfless field. It's the story of
the man whose youthful dreamI
am living.
He wanted to tell people's sto-
ries. He wanted this life, but he
gave itup. He never accomplished
his dream, but he was a better
father than he ever could have
been a sportswriter.
And he gave me the opportu-
nity to come here to Michigan, to
the Daily, to this farewell column,
to tell this story today.
Papa, after four years, Stephen
J., your son, salutes and thanks
you. I wish it could have come
sooner, but here's your story.
- Nesbitt can be reached
at stnesbit@umich.edu and on
Twitter: @stephenjnesbitt. He will
be interning at The Indianapolis
Star this summer and at The
Miami Herald this fall.

From Page l B

Sampson captures title, team places fourth

streak to 16 games with a
single. With the bases loaded,
Lawrence punched a single
through the middle to tie the
game.
Hutchins went with Susalla
in the pressure situation, call-
ing on the freshman to pinch
hit for senior third baseman
Knapp. Just as she had in the
final game against Michigan
State last weekend, Susalla
delivered on the first pitch she
saw, drilling a single up the
middle to take the lead and
secure a victory. A sacrifice fly
from Sweet gave the Wolver-
ines their fifth and final run of
the game.
"I kept the same one-pitch
mentality, worked on fol-
lowing the pitcher's tenden-
cies and adjusting to them,"
Susalla said. "I knew she was
throwing a certain pitch that
I wanted to look for. Waiting
for that pitch helped a lot, and
that's what I went for."
Two Wolverines extended
streaks of their own this week-
end.
Romero has reached base in
25 straight games. Blanchard
holds an 18-game hitting
streak, improving her batting
average to just under .500 on
the season.
"The coaches have taught
me how to finish my swing,"
Blanchard said. "The hitting
streak isjust an outcome of the
process of getting better."
During the Big Ten tirade,
Michigan is outscoring oppo-
nents 157-56.
With the majority of con-
ference play in the rearview
mirror, Michigan has a shot to
go undefeated in the Big Ten
for the first time in program
history. But for this team, the
most important game is on
Tuesday.
"People ask me about the
winningstreak, and I tell them
I don't care," Hutchins said.
"You can't control what you've
done in the past, you just play
one game."

By CINDY YU
Daily Sports Writer
Despite falling one spot short
of advancing to the NCAA Super
Six, the most prestigious meet in
collegiate gymnastics, the cap-
tains - senior Katie Zurales and
junior Joanna Sampson - led the
No. 7 Michigan women's gymnas-
tics team to the second-highest
NCAA Championships team score
in program history. Maintain-
ing composure throughout the
NCAA Semifinals at Pauley Pavil-
ionin Los Angeles, the Wolverines
scored a 196.850 in the evening
session on Friday night.
Based on top-four finishes in
individual events at the NCAA
Semifinals, Zorales and Sampson
were named first-team All-Amer-
icans and qualified to Sunday's
NCAA Event Finals on balance
beam and floor exercise, respec-
tively. Additionally, Sampson
qualified to the vault finals, and
both gymnasts were named first-
team All-Americans in the all-
around after tying for first with
scores of 39.525 in the second ses-
sion.
"Those two absolutely had a
great competition," said Michigan
coach Bev Plocki. "It was down
to the wire whether Katie would
be in the bar lineup. She had her
elbow tweaked at Big Tens and
didn't train or compete there at
Regionals. She potentially wasn't
even going to be an all-arounder
tonight and look what she did. I'm
very excited for them both.
"Joanna is a very powerful
athlete and Katie is an artistic
athlete... I don't think either one
of them could have done a better
job."
Only four teams have ever took
home an NCAA Championship
title, and three of them - Ala-
bama, UCLA and Utah - were in
the same subdivision as Michigan.
Though Michigan (17-2 Big Ten,
31-5 overall) competed in a tough
session, the team made quite an
entrance on bars, scoring a 49.400
- the school's highest team total
on that event at the NCAA Cham-

pionships since 1998 - to lead
after the first rotation. Stuck land-
ings punctuated the team's per-
formance, as Zurales and senior
Brittnee Martinez led the team
on that rotation. The two seniors
scored matching 9.900s to earn
them second-team All-American
honors, but not enough to qualify
them to bars finals.
"(Brittnee's) the one right now
that's hurting the most," Plocki
said. "Katie gets to delay her end
of gymnastics emotion until after
event finals and Natalie is com-
ing back next year. Brittnee felt
that brunt of that tonight, but she
certainly had a phenomenal year,
probably her best season at Michi-
gan.
"I don't want her to remember
this last competition. I want her to
remember the fabulous season she
had and how valuable she has been
to this team all year long."
On the second rotation, Michi-
gan struggled on beam, totaling
a 48.775 on the event, its worst
team score of the season. While
no one in the lineup fell, the Wol-

verines were unusually shaky all-
around, especially after nailing
routine after routine in the two
weeks of practice leading up to
NCAA Championships. Balance
checks and steps on landings cost
them valuable tenths that could
have been the difference between
competing in the Super Six on
Saturday and missing out. Zura-
les kept the fire alive by scoring a
9.875 for her near flawless routine
that landed hera spot in the beam
finals.
The Wolverines had a bye after
beam, slowing their momentum
and affecting them negatively, as
their mentality switched from a
time to relax to panic mode.
"It's very hard to come off an
event you're a little disappointed
with and go to a bye," Plocki said.
"We had an empty rotation to sit
around and think about (beam).
During the year when you don't
have byes, you can move onto
something else and your mind
changes. We came out, picked
ourselves up and performed, but
it wasn't with the same exuber-
j

ance that we started the meet out
on bars."
Added Sampson: "I think we
just went in with a different mind-
set than we normally do... We
had talked about controlling our
energy and using it in a good way
but I think we controlled ita little
bit too much, which made us ten-
tative versus going out there and
being aggressive like we are in
practice."
At the halfway point, Michi-
gan sat in fifth ahead of Arkan-
sas, trailing Alabama, Oklahoma,
UCLA and Utah by over three
tenths.
The Wolverines narrowed the
gap on floor after scoring a 49.400
for their efforts. Their floor total
ties for a school-best at the NCAA
Championships. Sampson led
her team on the rotation, scoring
a 9.925 for her explosive routine
highlighted by arguably her best
tumbling of the season. Not only
did she stick all of her passes with
ease, but her body also opened out
on her double layout and double
pike, a rare technique to master on
such difficult skills.
"I tried to have as much fun as
I could, especially because when
we're having fun - myself includ-
ing everyone else on the team -
we usually do our best routines,"
Sampson said.
Zurales showcased power-
ful tumbling, as well, to receive
second-team All-American hon-
ors for her routine that scored a
9.900. Zurales was in the race for
the coveted all-around title, as she
needed a 9.925 to tie Florida fresh-
man Bridget Sloan.
Finishing the meet up on vault,
Zurales scored a 9.850 for her
stuck, yet slightly piked down,
Yurchenko full. Freshman Austin
Sheppard had only a tiny step on
her landing to score a 9.875 for her
vault, while Sampson carried over
her explosiveness on the floor to
this rotation. She scored a session-
high 9.950 for her Yurchenko full
that featured a huge block, great
height and a perfect landing.
Michigan's comeback from
beam was not enough to surpass

Alabama, UCLA and Oklahoma
after their second bye. Even so, the
Wolverines have much to be proud
of, as they finished their season
with the most wins ina single sea-
son since 2005.
"We fought until the very end,"
Zuralessaid."Myheartjustbreaks
for this teambecause we're so spe-
cial. I don't think anyone under-
stands just how much work we put
into this coming from where we
were last year to this year."
Reflecting and ready to prove
that they belong in that group of
six next year, they told Plocki,
"Next year starts Monday."
Although the team competi-
tion was over for the Wolverines,
the Block 'M' would still be repre-
sented at Sunday's event finals by
the captains.
Eighth up in a group of twelve,
Sampson delivered her usual pow-
erful floor routine, displaying her
clean dance and monstrous tum-
bling. She scored a 9.9375, enough
to take home the NCAA floor title.
Having been ranked No. 1 for
the majority of the season on
floor, Sampson emphasizes the
added pressure of hitting that one
routine in NCAA Semifinals and
NCAA Event Finals, as the quali-
fiers and winners are based solely
on those routines, not the past
meet history.
Additionally, Sampson compet-
ed a clean Yurchenko full with a
small step back in the vault finals,
scoring a 9.8583 to tie for 14th
place on the event.
Zurales, competing the last
routine of her career in the beam
-finals, executed a wobble-free
performance to finish runner-up
by 0.0025 to Sloan. She scored
a 9.8875 for her routine that
featured sticks on an aerial to
backhandspring flight series, con-
nected beat to sheep jump and
roundoff double twist dismount.
Speechless and in tears, Zurales
said: "From being able to repre-
sent my team to just going out on
astrongnote, I don'tevenhave the
words to describe what it meant to
me and how honored I was to be
out there."

Fourth straight Big Ten title for 'M'

By ELI SPARKMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Friday, the No. 6 Michigan
women's tennis team walked into
the Varsity Tennis Center for its
last home meet of the year, sport-
ing a special senior day T-shirt.
On the front was the word Mimi,
the two'M'sbeingMichiganblock
'M's. On the back, it said, "All we
do is ... Nguyen, Nguyen, Nguy-
en." Nguyen, pronounced "win,"
is in reference to Michigan's
lone senior, Mimi Nguyen, and is
a play on the words of the 2010
DJ Khaled MICHIGAN 7
song, "All I OHIO STATE 0
Do is Win."
With the T-shirt, the Wolverines
successfully crafted a very fitting
mantra for not only the day, the
weekend and the season, but also
the last couple years.
Michigan (8-1 Big Ten, 17-4
overall) rolled into the week-
end having dropped only one
of its last 13 meets, a streak that
included six wins against ranked
opponents, even knocking off No.
2 Duke on March 1. Now the only
thing that stood in the Wolver-
ines' way of a fourth consecutive
Big Ten regular-season title was
Penn State (3-6, 13-6) and Ohio
State (3-6,10-11).
Iftheyhappened to slip against
either of the two beatable teams,
they knew No. 12 Nebraska was
looming right behind to steal the
title.
Friday, sophomore Emina
Bektas and company showed up
determined. Michigan secured
the doubles point early on with
wins from the No. 2 seed, senior

Dodge, in an epic 9-8 tiebreaker.

and junior Brooke Bolender also

Bolender came storming out of
the gate, not allowing the Buck-
eyes to win a single game. The
Wolverines' Nos. 2 and 3 seeds
each won handedly as well, 8-5.
Just like that, the doubles point
advantage was capturedby Mich-
igan. When taking the doubles
point, the Wolverines have yet to
lose.
The Wolverines won five of the
six singles matches in straight
sets. Unlike Friday, Bektas was
on the board first. She defeated
Ohio State's Kelsey Dieters rather
quickly, 6-3, 6-1. Next was No.
3 seed Sarah Lee, who made up
for her loss on Friday by beating
Kara Cecil, 6-2, 6-2. Michigan's
No. 2 seed Yurovsky and No. 6
seed Dodge were the other two
to finish their opponent in two
sets. In what was the longest and
most exciting match Sunday, Zhu
came back from losing the first
set 1-6, to win the second set in a
tiebreaker and ultimatelywin the
match in a third-set tiebreaker.
"This is the right time to be
peaking," said Michigan coach
Ronnie Bernstein. "I was glad to
see one of our best performances
today."
Looking back, the Wolverines
were spot on with their senior day
T-shirts. And for Nguyen, her four
years in the program have meant
four consecutive Big Ten regular-
season titles for the Wolverines.
"It has been really exciting
to be a part of the great history
here at Michigan," Nguyen said.
"We have to stay focused though,
because we're going to have to
play all these tough teams again
in Big Tens."
The Wolverines look to con-
tinue the trend of "Nguyen-ning"
in both the Big Ten and the NCAA
Tournaments. They will head to
Bloomington for the first round
of the Big Ten Tournament on
Thursday.

ished.
In the NCAA Qualifier on Fri-
day afternoon, the top 12 teams
in the nation competed for six
spots in the team finals Saturday.
Michigan needed to place in the
top three of its session in order to
advance, and the Wolverines set
the tone early, ultimately grab-
bing first place in their session.
Last season, Michigan also
finished in the top spot in their
session but ultimately ended
up in last place after Saturday,
so the Wolverines knew they
couldn't let their early success
lead to overconfidence heading
into the finals.
"Last year's problems really
helped us to get there this year,"
Golder said. "I mean, just about
the whole team was there last
year so that experience just
helped everyone this year.
"After we won our session last
year in the prelims, we were cel-
ebrating, but this year it was just
as usual and we had a 'We're not
done' mentality. So that really is
experience and maturation as a
competitor."
Friday, Michigan scored
70-plus points on all six events,
but its performance on the par-
allel bars stole the show on the
first day of competition, scoring
a season-best 75.90. All three
Wolverine competitors broke the
personal 15-barrier, with senior
Syque Caesar leading the way
with his 15.60.
This time, Michigan's expe-
rience stood out in every event
Saturday. The confidence Golder
had in his team was reflected
by his decision to start the meet
off on championship Saturday
with pommel horse, widely con-
sidered the hardest of the six
events. The Wolverines scored
their third-highest mark of the
season, hitting an event-high
72.250.
Michigan moved onto the
rings, where it had a terrific sec-
ondrotation.Junior AlexBubnov
went first and set a career-high
15.25, followed by junior Jor-
dan Gaarenstroom, who also hit
a career best with his monster
15.600-point performance.
From there, the Wolverines
made everything look easy.
Mikulak took on his best event,
the high bar, where he scored a
15.650. Saturday night's podium
was filled with maize and blue,
but it didn't end there for Michi-

gan, which continued its domi-
nance Sunday.
Eight Wolverines qualified for
individual finals, and five came
out with spots on the podium. In
addition, gymnasts who finish in
the top eight in individual events
are awarded All-American sta-
tus - Michigan tied a program
high with 13.
Like the rest of the weekend,
Mikulak led the way on Sun-
day, earning individual titles in
high bar and parallel bar, while
grabbing third place on floor.
The 13-time All-American and
five-time NCAA champion's
high-bar performance was so
dominant that he notched more
then a point higher than the next
closest competitor and scored a
weekend-high 16.100.
"I honestly don't think I have
(had a better weekend)," Miku-
lak said. "Olympic trials were
definitely really exciting for
me, but overall for this entire
weekend, I didn't miss a single
routine. It just kind of felt easy
going with the flow, I'm just real
pleased with howI did."
In addition to Mikulak's
achievements, Caesar got second
on the parallel bars and third on
the high bar. He also tied with
teammate senior Rohan Sebas-
tian for fourth on floor.
With a hugely success-
ful NCAA weekend under its
belt, Michigan will walk away
from this season accomplish-
ing everything it wanted to. The
Wolverines not only earned the
team title, the all-around title
and two individual titles, but
they also won the Big Ten cham-
pionship two weeks ago. The Big
Ten proved to be no cakewalk, as
four of the six teams that quali-
fied for Saturday came from the
conference.
And as if all of his team's suc-.
cess wasn't enough, Golder got
to watch the program in con-
ference rival Penn State's home
gym. The Nittany Lions spent
most of the season one spot
above the Wolverines in the con-
ference standings and the Asso-
ciated Press standings.
In the end, it was a perfect
weekend for Michigan.
"It's great to be a Michigan
Wolverine," Golder said. "We
had a great championship, you
get a one-two sweep, and the
all-around and win the team
title, (13) All-Americans and
one national champion on two
events. It doesn't get a whole lot
better than that. I'm very, very
pleased and anxious to host next
year."

On the road and at Wrigley,
Wolverines finally stumble

By MAX COHEN
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan baseball coach Erik
Bakich frequently preaches that
pitching and defense are the keys
behind all winning teams. Never
did that seemmore apparent than
this weekend, as the Wolverines
dropped
two games MICHIGAN 0
in a three- N'WESTERN 6
game series
against MICHIGAN 5
Northwest- N'WESTERN 0
ern. MICHIGAN 2
The first N'WESTERN 3
two games
of the series were characterized
by dominant pitching, as the
Wildcats (5-9 Big Ten, 17-14 over-
all) earned a 6-0shutout on Satur-
day night, and Michigan pitched
a shutout in the first game of the
doubleheader on Sunday, win-
ning 5-0. In the rubber match of
the series - and the second game
of the doubleheader Sunday - the
Wolverines' late-inning defense
faltered while their offense failed
to pull away, costing them the
game and their third-straight Big
Ten series victory.
With Friday's game postponed
until Sunday because of rain, the
series began Saturday night at
Wrigley Field. While playing in a
major-league stadium was a first-
time experience for both teams
this season, Northwestern right-
hander Luke Farrell pitched as
though he belonged, throwing a
complete-game shutout. Farrell,
the son of Boston Red Sox man-
ager John Farrell, stymied the
Wolverine lineup, allowing just
three Michigan batters to reach
base - all on singles.
"You have to tip your cap to the
pitcher once in awhile," Bakich
said. "He forced a lot of weak
contact."
The Wolverines (8-4, 22-16)
didn't advance a runner into scor-
ing position until they had one
out in the eighth inning, when
sophomore left fielder Zach Zott
headed to second base after soph-
omore designated hitter Kevin
White laid down a bunt single.
Farrell responded promptly by
recording consecutive strikeouts,
ending the Michigan threat. One
inning later, he retired the side,
ending the Wolverines' 10-game
winning streak.
In Sunday's first game, Michi-

gan received strong starting
pitching of its own, as freshman
left-hander Evan Hill pitched
seven shutout innings. Hill
allowed four hits and three walks
in the outing.
"I was attacking hitters early,"
Hill said. "I still walked a few
guys, but overall I kept the big
inning out of the picture."
Michigan freshman short-
stop Travis Maezes provided the
needed offense with his third-
inning, three-run, inside-the-
park home run. The Wolverines
tacked on insurance runs in the
sixth and ninth innings, and
sophomore right-hander Matt
Ogden pitched two scoreless
innings to end the game, extend-
ing his streak of scoreless innings
to 21.2.
For seven innings, Sunday's
second game looked as if it was
going to be the third-straight
shutout in the series. Michigan
built a 2-0 lead while redshirt
junior left-hander Logan McA-
nallen cruised through seven
innings, allowing just four hits
while surrendering two walks,
bouncing back after a start
against Penn State last week-
end in which he lasted only one
inning.
After his exit, things became
dicey for the Wolverines, when
freshman right-hander Jacob
Cronenworth - normally auto-
maticfor Michiganinlate innings
- struggled in the eighth inning.
Northwestern scored its first run
of the inning on two singles, a
sacrifice bunt and a sacrifice fly.
The Wildcats then tied the game
on a fielding error by Maezes.
"Nine out of 10times, he makes
that tough play, but he just wasn't

able to come up with it today,"
Bakich said.
The Wolverines failed to
respond in the ninth inning
despite good opportunities to
score. Zott led off the inning,
with a single and then advanced
to second on a sacrifice bunt, but
he was thrown out attempting
to steal third on what Bakich felt
was a questionable call.
"The umpire didn't see it the
way that we saw it, the way peo-
ple in the stadium saw it," Bakich
said. "He saw it the way he saw
it and made the call the way he
thoughthe should make the call."
Had he stayed put at second or
made it safely to third, Zott likely
would've scored after freshman
first baseman Jack Sexton singled
in the same at-bat in which Zott
was thrown out. To make mat-
ters worse, Northwestern robbed
junior catcher Cole Martin of a
likely double to right field in the
next at-bat.
The game remained tied
until the bottom of the 10th
inning, when . Northwestern
won on a walk-off fielding error
by Cronenworth. It was one of
two Cronenworth errors in the
inning. Like Maezes on his error,
Bakich believes Cronenworth
makes both of those plays the
vast majority of opportunities,
attributing some of the struggles
to the long grass on Northwest-
ern's field.
"The real issue was we didn't
separate ourselves offensively
from the third inning on," Bakich
said. "We need to do a better job
of scoring more runs and separat-
ing our leads so we are not even
in that position where it's a nail-
biter in the end."

Since the day Trey Burke decid-
ed to return to Ann Arbor for his
sophomore season, the 2012-13
Michigan men's basketball team
was expected to contend for a
Final Four. It didn't disappoint,
either, remaining in the nation's
top 10 for the entire season and
eventually reaching its goal in
Atlanta.
Though Burke and junior guard
Tim Hardaway Jr. have since
departed in favor of the NBA
Draft, freshmen forwards Mitch
McGary and Glenn Robinson III
chose to follow Burke's lead and
stay for their sophomore seasons.
Their decisions, along with anoth-
er top-flight recruiting class, posi-
tion the Wolverines for another
Big Ten title and Final Four hunt.
Despite the departure of
Burke and Hardaway, Michigan
essentially returns four start-
ers - McGary started each game
in the NCAA Tournament, while
redshirt junior forward Jordan
Morgan started nearly the entire
regular season after holding the
starting post spot throughout the
previous two seasons.
The Daily broke down the Wol-
verines' upcoming roster, position
by position:
Point guard: When Burke
picked up two quick fouls in the
championship game against Lou-
isville, freshman Spike Albrecht
filled in more than admirably, net-
ting 17 points on 4-of-4 shooting
from 3-point range. In the second
half, everyone was reminded of
the Albrecht we saw - or didn't
see - for much of the season, the
one who hit just four 3-pointers in
his 18 appearances during confer-
ence play.
Albrecht should see a rise in
minutes from his 8.1 minutes per
game average last season, and
as he showed in the Final Four,
his shooting touch gives him the
capability to score in bunches, but
he'll likely play in another reserve
role. Albrecht will probably be
the starting point guard when the
Wolverines open their season in
November, but like Matt Vogrich
this year, he'll likely accept a
diminished role in favor of incom-
ing freshman Derrick Walton Jr.
as the non-conference slate pro-
gresses.
Walton, a Detroit native, is
the nation's No. 37 recruit -
good for the eighth-best point
guard - according to Rivals.com,
which tabbed Michigan's incom-
ing class at No. 12, second in the
Big Ten behind Indiana. Walton,
like Burke, is undersized - each
stands at 6-feet tall -but is lauded
for his passing and shooting abili-
ties. His defense remains a ques-
tion mark, but on offense, he's
consistently been tabbed as a "true
point guard" who could flourish in
a Wolverine offense loaded with a
wealth ofscoring options.
Bottom line: No matter how
well Walton or Albrecht play, this
position will be a downgrade from
the consensus National Player of
the Year, who played more than 35
minutes per game. Inexperience
could hamper Walton early on,
but when given time to jelliwith all
of his surrounding talent, Walton
should be able to facilitate another
dangerously talented Michigan
offense.

Wing: Hardaway's offensive
production can be replaced, but
can his defense? After being a
defensive liability for most of
his first two seasons, Hardaway
turned into one of the Wolverines'
most reliable perimeter defenders,
often guarding the opposition's
top outside threat.
Michigan coaches have already
said they're planning on employ-
ing more lineups with two big
men on the floor at the same time,
which would allow Robinson to
play at his natural position, small
forward, rather than the under-
sized power forward role he
played for most of his freshman
season. Given the circumstances,
Robinson's play was respectable,
but against bigger teams, he was
abused defensively and disap-
peared on the offensive end. At
the small forward position, Rob-
inson could terrorize opposing
teams with his flexibility to play
on the perimeter or post up small-
er defenders, while his ability to
find space in transition is as good
as anyone in the country.
Freshman guard Nik Stauskas
isn't the porous defender he was at
the start of the conference season,
but he'll still benefit greatly from
another offseason of strength and
conditioning, as well as coaching.
Combined with Robinson on the
wing, the Wolverines are already
looking at a formidable one-two
punch, but perhaps the team's top
wingman next season, incoming
freshman Zak Irvin, hasn't even
graduated high school.
The five-star product, Indiana's
2012-13 Mr. Basketball, is Rivals.
tom's No. 24 prospect. At 6-foot-
6, his measurables are similar
to Hardaway, but he possesses
greater ball-handling skills and an
impressive knack for gettingto the
basket or creating his own shot,
which is solid.
With so much top-heavy talent,
it's easy to forget freshman guard
Caris LeVert, who wasn't even a
Wolverine commitment at this
time last year. LeVert's 6-foot-5
frame was so scrawny that coach-
es quickly decided to redshirt
him, but they quickly changed
their course when his play in prac-
tice was too good to keep off the
floor. LeVert is a superb perim-
eter defender who has flashed an
ability to shoot and rebound. His
body should benefit tremendously
from a full offseason in a colle-
giate strength and conditioning
program.
Bottom line: Hardaway took
the basketball program to a new
level, but Michigan has a wealth
of riches on the wing that might
make forgetting Hardaway easy
by the middle of next season. The
top-four contributors here can
score in a variety of ways, both in
transition and in half-court sets,
and despite the loss of Hardaway,
should even provide an upgrade
on the defensive end with Robin-
son playing at small forward.
Post: While Michigan will
certainly miss Burke, McGary's
departure could've rivaled Burke's
in terms of setting the program
back. With the freshman in Ann
Arbor for another season, the
Wolverines have their entire
frontcourt back, which should set
fear into opposing coaches.
McGary averaged 6.2 points
and 5.1 rebounds in under 20
minutes per game during confer-

ence play last season, mostly off
the bench, but took the nation
by storm after a promotion into
the starting lineup to kick off the
NCAA Tournament. In over 30
minutes per game, he averaged a
double-double, dominating some
of the country's best post men,
including Kansas' Jeff Withey.
McGary was admittedly out of
shape and wasn't eating right
until the middle of the season
and should build upon a better
conditioning and eating regimen
with another college offseason
program. In the tournament, he
reminded everyone why he was
once ranked as the nation's No.
2 recruit, and he should only get
better next year.
But the frontcourt doesn't end
with McGary. Earlier this week,
Michigan coach John Beilein
indicated that he'd use two big
men on the floor at the same time
for at least significant portions of
games, something he has done
very little of during his tenure in
Ann Arbor. The days of the Wol-
verines getting absolutely abused
in the post ended this past season,
but Michigan still struggled with
post-orientedteams like Michigan
State. That should change in the
upcomingyear.
Morgan is a three-year starter
but never seemed to fully recover
from a midseason ankle injury.
A healthy Morgan - one of the
conference's top low-post defend-
ers - alongside a still-developing
Jon Horford, gives the Wolverines
three solid post players. Incom-
ing forward Mark Donnal, who
fell just outside the nation's top-
100 prospects, could challenge
for playtime, and redshirt fresh-
man Max Bielfeldt can provide a
reliable few minutes per game if
needed, as well.
Bottom line: McGary flashed
All-American potential in the
NCAA Tournament, and assum-
ing he doesn't regress, Michigan
should actually be able to consis-
tently outmuscle Big Ten teams
in the post - something it hasn't
been able to do in years. While the
Wolverines won't always employ a
two-post man lineup, they'll cer-
tainly have the option to.
So what does this all mean?
Burke had the talent to win games
all by himself, and he did so count-
less times. While he'll be missed,
Michigan will have a combination
of talent and depth it hasn't had
since at least the Fab Five years.
Beilein has proven his wizardry
time and time again when it comes
to adjusting his system to his line-
up, and that could shine through
this year like never before. The
Wolverines have so many offen-
sive options - playing two bigs,
going small, pushing the pace,
playing in the half court - that
their offense shouldn't skip a beat
once Walton gains some experi-
ence.
Defense will again be the ques-
tion mark, but with the ability to
play two men in the post, oppos-
ing teams won't be able to exploit
a weakness down low like they
could in years past.
Michigan will be an even
younger team than last year's,
which was one of the nation's
youngest. But if Irvin and Walton
can adjust to the college game -
and they should - the Wolverines
are poised for another Big Ten title
hunt and a top-10 finish.
