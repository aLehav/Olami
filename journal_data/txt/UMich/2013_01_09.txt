TECHNOLOGY
CToolIs gets major upgrade

Wolverine Access
next in line for
interface overhaul
and new features
By PETER SHAHIN
Daily News Editor
Over Winter Break, the
University's Information and
Technology Services launched
an update for CTools, bringing
anew user interface and abasic
level of integration with ser-

vices like Google and Box. The
upgrade focuses on improving
ease of use and stability.
"Students would be most
interested in the improved
navigation and the overall user
experience and user inter-
face," said Sean DeMonner,
ITS director of teaching and
learning. "There's been a lot of
emphasis on reliability. As you
might imagine, CTools is a mis-
sion critical application."
The latest upgrade includes
improvements such as collaps-
ible windows, easier access
to each course site and fewer

clicks to get to frequently
accessed material. The upgrade
also includes pass-through
links to University partners,
such as Google and Box-a file
storage site-to help students
access information stored else-
where.
While CTools does not offer
native support for these plat-
forms, DeMonner said fur-
ther integration would be a
focal point for future upgrades
to CTools. He said the next
upgrade, which will prob-
ably focus on stability issues
and minor enhancements, will

occur around March of this
year.
"We don't yet know exactly
what will be in those releases,
but it's likely that we will con-
tinue to pursue our strategy of
integrating external services
and making deeper ties with
external systems we already
have on campus," DeMonner
said.
DeMonner said he envisions
a system in which an instruc-
tor could create an assignment
within CTools that would auto-
matically update on every stu-

Political scientist
focused on black
involvement in
American politics
By AARON GUGGENHEIM

Daily News Editor and
Daily StaffReporter
Political Science Prof. Hanes
Walton Jr. died Monday, accord-
ing to the American Political
Science Association. He was 72.
Walton was known affec-
tionately among students for
his memorable lectures filled
with anecdotes and jokes about
politicians and current affairs.
He was equally esteemed by his
colleagues in the world of politi-
cal science: He was elected vice
president of the American Polit-
ical Science Association earlier
this year and was a prominent
researcher at the Institute for
Social Research.
The University was not
immediately available for com-

ment, and the cause of
his passing is still unclear.
Walton was scheduled to teach
two classes this semester, and
students were notified that
his first lectures have been
canceled, but it is currently
unknown if the classes will con-
tinue.
After receiving a Ph.D. in
Government from Howard Uni-
versity in 1967, Walton went on
to teach at Savannah State Col-
lege; Atlanta University and the
University of Georgia before
arriving at the University in
1992.
In the course of 40 years,
Walton's extensive worked and
researched extensively on Afri-
can American participation in
the American political system,
including publishing 21 books
and textbooks.
Walton co-authored Ameri-
can Politics and the African-
American Quest for Universal
Freedom - a textbook is in its
sixth edition - with Robert C.
Smith. Walton also served on
numerous editorial boards for

Pay As You Earn
changes rules on
repayment plans
By BEN ATLAS
Daily Staff Reporter
. Facing economic uncertain-
ty and the increasing costs of
higher education, recent col-
lege graduates are getting some
relief from the federal govern-
ment.
Last month, the Department
of Education introduced a new
Pay As You Earn student loan
repayment plan, which will cap
monthly payments for Federal
Direct Student Loans at 10 per-
cent of discretionary income.
In addition to reducing month-
ly loan payments, the program
allows graduates to pay off
their loan over a 20-year peri-
od, rather than the standard 10
years.
"We know many recent grad-
uates are worried about repay-
ing theiwr student loans as our
economy continues to recover,
and now it's easier than ever
for student borrowers to lower
monthly payments and stay on
track," U.S. Secretary of Edu-
cation Arne Duncan said in a
statement.
Changes in student loan poli-
cy are sure to affect much of the
undergraduate population at
the University. According to the
University's Office of Financial
Aid, about 85 percent of resident
undergraduates and 55 percent

DETROIT (AP) - A review

Snyder could appoint an emer-
gency manager. Bing would
have 10 days to appeal.
"I think the review team -
maybe on the 11th or so - will
go back to the governor with
a recommendation," Bing told
reporters Tuesday afternoon
at City Hall. "With that recom-
mendation it will be incumbent
upon the governor to make a
decision as to whether or not to
bring somebody else in or to let
us keep going forward.
"Our goal is to keep going
forward. I've said from the
very beginning, we didn't
want an emergency man-
ager."
Detroit has struggled with
its cash flow for more than a
year and has a budget deficit
of about $327 million.
The review 'team is the
second appointed by Snyder
to pore over Detroit's books.
A year ago, the first team
stopped short of declaring a
financial emergency, which
would have provided the
governor with the impetus
to appoint a manager.
Instead, Snyder and Bing
worked out a consent agree-
ment last spring that would
keep him on as mayor while
providing some state support
for Detroit's restructuring.
The deal came without
any direct state funding.

Gov. Rick Snyder on Tuesday
signed a law prohibiting novice
teen drivers from using a hand-

wheel, anod to agrievingmother's
push to enact the restrictions after
her daughter was killed in a car

The law "strikes our hearts in

Wiki-leaker was
mistreated
An Army private suspected'
of sending reams of classified
documents to the secret-sharing
WikiLeaks website was illegally
punished at a Marine Corps brig
and should get 112 days cut from
any prison sentence he receives
if convicted, a military judge
ruled Tuesday.
Army Col. Denise Lind ruled
during a pretrial hearing that
authorities went too far in their
strict confinement of Pfc. Brad-
ley Manning for nine months in
a Marine Corps brig in Quantico,
Va., in 2010 and 2011. Manning
was confined to a windowless
cell 23 hours a day, sometimes
with no clothing. Brig officials
said it was to keep him from
hurting himself or others.
Lind said Manning's confine-
ment was "more rigorous than
necessary." She added that the
conditions "became excessive
in relation to legitimate govern-
ment interests."

Venezuelan leader
is reportedly ill
President Hugo Chavez won't
be able to attend his scheduled
swearing-in this week, Venezuela's
government announced Tuesday,
confirming suspicions that the
leader's illness will keep him in a
Cuban hospital past the key date.
Vice President Nicolas Mad-
uro broke the news in a letter
to National Assembly President
Diosdado Cabello, saying on the
recommendation of Chavez's
medical team, his recovery pro-
cess "should be extended beyond
Jan. 10" and for that reason he
won't be able to attend Thursday's
scheduled inauguration.
Maduro said Chavez was invok-
ing a provision in the constitution
allowinghim to be sworn in before

the Supreme Court at a "later
date." Cabello announced he had
received the request during a leg-
islative session.
Tensions between the govern-
ment and opposition have been
building in a constiutitonal dis-
pute over whether the ailing presi-
dent's swearing-in can legally be
postponed.
LAGOS, Nigeria
Flames threaten
Nigerian slums
A massive fire tore through
a waterfront slum in Nigeria's
megacity of Lagos on Tuesday,
burning down dozens of shack
workshops and homes. When
firefighters didn't turn up, locals
tried in vain to stop the blaze
with buckets of water.
The fire hit along the dirty
shoreline of the Lagos Lagoon, an
-area full of sawmills that process
lumber floated into the city from
hundreds of miles (kilometers)
away. Massive piles of sawdust
and loose shavings fill the area.
By Tuesday afternoon, a thick
plume of smoke rose from the
mills over the city's long Third
Mainland Bridge, which links
the metropolis to its islands.

Students fondly remember
Walton for his lectures and

LSA junior Chris Mays said
Walton was always making
jokes that made the material
easy to learn and recall.
"He was always in - direct

Mays said. "He would challenge
you in his own unique way."
He added that Walton
inspired him to become a politi-

University alum Theresa

interview that she remem-

bered his passionate rambling
remarks about anything from
"love letters between John
Adams and his wife" to "Ger-

And although his teaching
methods were unorthodox,
Bodwin said Walton was an
incredible professor.
"I am sad for my loss, but
more sad for the students loss,"
Bodwin wrote. "Hanes was
truly an inspirational professor
that did not follow rules."
Former students also shared
Bodwin's grief and respect for
Walton on social media. Stu-

their fondness for Walton's
anecdotes and their experience
of him as a professor.
University alum Ghida Dagh-

tion for emergency contracep-
tion over the phone, an issue
Irwin also took issue with.
"If you're in a rural area that
doesn't have a lot of access to
clinics and providers and you
need emergency contraception
- they call it emergency for a
reason - you should be able to
call that in," Irwin said.
The emergency manager law
that was struck down by voters
on a statewide ballot in Novem-
ber was also rehashed in this
lame-duck session.
The original law allowed the
state government to appoint
an emergency manager to take
over the mayoral and financial
duties of cities deemed close to
bankruptcy or in need of help.
The new bill adds options
beyond the manager for the
affected cities: a consent agree-
ment, bankruptcy, mediation or
the original choice of an emer-
gency manager.
Irwin said he views these
options as "nonsensical"
because the point of the law was
to stop communities from hav-
ing to declare bankruptcy in the

first place.
"I think they did it for politi-
cal reasons ... it's a false choice,"
Irwin said.
The Internet Privacy Pro-
tection Act, also passed during
the session, makes it illegal for
employers to demand access to
or punish employees because of
personal Internet accounts such
as Twitter and Facebook.
Changes were also made to
the medical marijuana legisla-
tion: permit expiration dates
have been extended to two
years and anyone who has com-
mitted a felony involving drugs
cannot be a provider of medical
marijuana.
Personal property tax legisla-
tion eliminated a tax levied on
businesses that, according to
Irwin, raised more than a bil-
lion dollars a year.
Although Irwin said that
there was agreement in the
House that personal property
tax was "a really inelegant and
undesirable" revenue genera-
tor, he added that there needs to
be a strategy to replace this lost .
revenue.
"All this money - we're tak-
ing about just over a billion
dollars - goes to local govern-
ments, and the local govern-
ments use that money to provide
police and firemen," Irwin said.
Brown, the economics pro-
fessor, said he found it surpris-
ing that so much legislation
was passed in such a short
amount of time. He said he is
displeased with much of what
was passed.
"I think rushing to pass
things that you won't be able
to pass in the New Year doesn't
seem like a great idea," Brown
said. "On the other hand, not
doing anything seems like a bad
idea (too)."

Naeem also said that the proj-

"Our hope is that the Under-

Not all students were recep-

she didn't like needing to manu-
ally change the courses that

the change.
Hesano added that transi-

rather than the recent transition

LOANS

of non-resident undergraduates
receive need-based and/or non-
need-based financial aid.
Pam Fowler, executive direc-
tor of the Office of Financial
Aid, said this new plan is a step
in the right direction but still
foresees graduates running
into some difficulties. Because
the government offers mul-
tiple repayment plans, Fowler
said some students may find it
difficult to determine which
repayment plan is best for their
financial situation.
On the other hand, many
students are unaware of the
abundance of loan options
available, Fowler said. In some
cases, graduates are not getting
good information about alter-
native loan repayment options
from the federal servicer who
handles their case. As a result
students may have issues mak-
ing their payments in full and
on time.
If graduates are not receiv-
ing sufficient information
from their federal servicers,
Fowler suggested they contact
the Office of Financial Aid for
advice.

Pay As You Earn, which went
into effect at the end of last
month, will not have any effect
on the limit a student can borrow
from the federal government.
The Office of Financial Aid is
responsible for reporting costs
of attendance and the maximum
amount a student can borrow
each year for accuracy in govern-
ment loan collection.
The new plan will also not
affect how the Financial Aid
Office operates, Fowler said.
The Department of Educa-
tion will continue to send the
office a list of graduates who
are late on loan payments, and
the Financial Aid Office will try
to contact them in order to get
them back on track.
Fowler warns that students
need to borrow responsibly
and ensure that they are able to
repay the loan entirely.
"We still have to do a very
good job of cautioning students
to borrow for needs, not for
wants," Fowler said.
Still, she said Pay As You
Earn is a great way to give grad-
uates more relief in paying off
their debts.
"Any plan that will keep a
student out of default is a good
thing, and that is what these
plans are designed to do."

Former U.S.-Rep.
forms PAC for gun
control
TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -
Tuesday was not just a day for
Tucson to remember the victims
of the deadly shooting that
severely injured then-U.S. Rep.
Gabrielle Giffords. It was also
a day when residents could see
firsthand the nation's gun debate
play out in a busy parking lot
outside a city police station.
On one side was a councilman
who supports gun controlleading
anefforttogive $50grocerystore
gift cards to anyone who turned
intheir firearmsto police. Onthe
other was an event organized by
a state senator that turned into
an open, unregulated and legal
marketplace for firearms.
"We have a fundamental hole
in the private sales of guns. You
can walk up right in front of a cop
and buy a gun, no background
check, ' nothing," said
Councilman Steve Kozachik.
"How much more flawed can the
system be?"
The people who bought
guns from each other declined
repeated requests for comments.
The senator and gun rights
advocate didn't stay at the event,
but earlier said he was angered
by the timing of Kozachik's
event and that paying $50 for a
gun was such little money that it
amounted to theft.
The dueling gun buyback
programs - and the annual
ringing of bells to remember
the six dead and 13 injured,
including Giffords, during the
January 2011 attack - came as
the congresswoman and her
husband announced that they
were forming a political action
committee aimed at preventing
gun violence.
Giffords and husband Mark
Kelly, a former astronaut,
discussed the effort in an op-ed
published in USA Today and

in an interview on ABC News.
The interview also provided
a glimpse of Giffords' long
recovery since being shot in the
head two years ago.
She does speech and physical
therapy and yoga. She has a
service dog named Nelson who
helps her keep balance and
guides her. She recently gained
more movement in her right
foot and can walk faster. She
still struggles with her vision,
especially on her periphery. She
said family is what makes her the
happiest.
Giffords struggled to speak
in complete sentences, but
provided several one-word
answers to anchor Diane Sawyer
in describing her recovery and
response to the shootings in
Tucson and Connecticut. She
used the word "enough" to react
to the thoughtofchildrengetting
killed in a classroom. She said
"daggers" to recount her tense,
face-to-face encounter with
shooter Jared Lee Loughner at
his sentencing in November. She
said "sad" to describe his mental
illness. She is frustrated that
her recovery has not progressed
more quickly.
Kelly and Giffords wrote in
the op-ed that their Americans
for Responsible Solutions
initiative would help raise money
to support greater gun control
efforts and take on the powerful
gun lobby.
"Achieving reforms to reduce
gun violence and prevent mass
shootings will mean matching
gun lobbyists in their reach and
resources," the couple wrote.
They said that it will "raise
funds necessary to balance the
influence of the gun lobby."
There was already some
concern among gun control
advocates that they were losing
the momentum they hoped to
have after the Newtown, Conn.,
elementary school shooting that
left 20 children and six adults
dead in December. Congress was
already occupied with budget

concerns.
Giffords' announcement
brought back memories from
the 1980s when Jim and Sarah
Brady formed the Brady Center
to Prevent Gun Violence. Brady,
then-President Ronald Reagan's
press secretary, was wounded
in the 1981 presidential assassi-
nation attempt by a mentally ill
gunman.
Brady's organization has
been among the most vocal
champions of gun control since
then, but it remains to be seen
whether Giffords' group can
better compete against the
National Rifle Association and
its huge fundraising and politi-
cal clout.
The NRA spent at least $24
million in the 2012 election
cycle, including $16.8 million
through its political action com-
mittee and $7.5 million through
its affiliated Institute for Legis-
lative Action. By comparison, the
Brady . Campaign spent around
$5,800.
And when it comes to direct
lobbying of lawmakers, the NRA
was also dominant. Through
July 1, the NRA spent $4.4 mil-
lionto lobby Congress, compared
with the Brady Campaign's
$60,000.
"This country is known for
using its determination and inge-
nuity to solve problems, big and
small.Wise policyhas conquered
disease, protected us from dan-
gerous products and substances,
and made transportation safer"
Giffords and Kelly wrote. "But
when it comes to protecting our
communities from gun violence,
we're not even trying - and for
the worst of reasons."
As a House member, Gif-
fords was a centrist Democrat
who represented much of lib-
eral-leaning Tucson but also
more conservative, rural areas.
She supported gun rights and
owned a Glock pistol. The cou-
ple said they still own two guns
that are locked ina safe at their
house.

Make resolutions a reality
New goals for leaders at all levels
As 2013 begins, New Years resolutions may be a necessity for
everyone from University regents to Michigan Gov. Rick
Snyder. The past year has shown that while change is inevi-
table, it can't necessarily be equated with progress. When the elect-
ed officials begin their terms, it's essential for them to re-examine
past decisions and set specific, progressive goals.

Redefining disability

For the University, this means making
tuition equality areality for Michigan's undoc-
umented students. Some members of the Uni-
versity community, from students to the newly
elected Regent Shauna Ryder Diggs, are still
unaware of tuition equality, further demon-
strating the fact that the University needs to
make more of an effort to inform the commu-
nity about future changes. In December, the
Coalition for Tuition Equality staged a protest
at a Board of Regents meeting, demanding in-
state tuition for undocumented students who
grew up in the state of Michigan. The Univer-
sity should take these students seriously, and a
policy change should be made this year.
In Ann Arbor, transportation has been an
issue of contention at city council as well as at
the state level as Michigan struggles to form
a regional transit system. Councilmembers
and residents alike seem to be unsure of what
they'd like to see changed, yet the current
state of transportation in Ann Arbor is neither
efficient nor used to its fullest potential. The
current train station is outdated and not fully
utilized, but building another train station is
a costly endeavor. The regional transportation
system proposal, as it stands, will not serve
Ann Arbor's transportation needs most effec-
tively and faces opposition. Ann Arbor should
work to develop its own transportation plan
that makes travelling between counties easier,
while still addressing transportation within
the city.
If the marathon lame-duck session of the

Michigan state legislation proved anything, it
was that politicians are willing to ignore the
voices of citizens in order to pass ideological
legislation without dedicating time to proper
discussion. In less than two weeks, Michigan
became a right-to-work state, passed legisla-
tion to more heavily regulate abortion clin-
ics and passed legislation to allow concealed
weapons in schools, churches, hospitals, are-
nas and other locations, although the last bill
was vetoed by Snyder. These changes are quite
significant and the fact that they were passed
so quickly is troubling.
However, what's perhaps worse is that
politicians are suppressing the voices of their
constituents. Legislation was passed that will
now make it tougher to recall politicians. A
week before the right-to-work legislation was
passed, protestors were pepper sprayed out-
side of the Capitol Building in Lansing. In 2013,
state policymakers must allow proper time for
public engagement on issues and reexamine
the last minute - and at times shady - legisla-
tion that they recently passed. .
Instead of focusing on divisive social issues,
the state government should focus on support-
ing higher education. For the past 10 years,
Michigan has cut higher education funding,
usually resulting in tuition increases. Higher
education should not be the first on the chop-
ping block when the state needs to make bud-
get cuts. An educated workforce is crucial to
Michigan's future, and should be advocatedby
all policymakers.

Hovering outside the termi-
nal at Detroit Metro Air-
port before the sun shows
any sign of rising
was not the ideal
way I'd choose to
spend the morn-
ing after my
last final exam.
So when the
line remained
stagnant for an SARAH
extended period SKALUBA
of time and the
people behind
me became
noticeably aggravated, I silently
joined in on the group frustration.
Seconds later, we learned that the
temporary holdup was due to a
woman with hearing loss and her
family discussing a problem with
the ever-cheerful flight attendants
checking people in at Gate B.
Clearly there was a miscommu-
nication along the way - the flight
attendants were blatantly irked and
the passenger's face was flushed
with embarrassment. We boarded
within minutes of the confusion
and were quickly in our seats ready
to depart. However, the calmness
was fleeting as the flight attendants
once again pestered the female pas-
senger and her friend, this time to
change her seat. The woman with
the hearing impairment was ush-
ered from her original seat near
the emergency exit and instructed
to switch with a fellow passenger
a few rows up. What really got me
was the gossip that surrounded
the entire process: The hushed -
or maybe not-so-hushed - chat-
ter amongst passengers and flight
attendants alike.
It's gossip that I may not have

registered a few years ago, but on
this particular Wedneiday morning
it shook me. The whispers that fol-
lowed were insightful - illuminat-
ing the culture we foster here in the
United States. A culture that looks
down upon anything or anyone
that differs from the "norm." The
"norm" being a concept I don't quite
understand, considering we live in
a country bound by different reli-
gions, unique histories and diverse
backgrounds.
Nonetheless, we've grown up in
this society which prides itself on
acceptance, only to witness the com-
plete opposite all too often in our
daily lives. The word "disability"
should not make you feel uncomfort-
able. It shouldn't be a concept that
you feel can't be discussed over cof-
fee or argued in an academic setting.
We live in a world where one in five
Americans has a disability, be it vis-
ible to the naked eye or not. It maybe
physical, mental or a combination of
many factors. So why are most con-
versations surrounding disability
taboo or completely misconstrued?
It seems there are two stereotypi-
cal representations of disability in
the United States: the athlete who
has overcome grand obstacles to
achieve success against all odds and
the mentally unstable mass murder-
er who kills innocent people without
a motive. This type of thinking is
beyond flawed.
Taking Professor Melanie Yer-
geau's course, Disability Studies,
crystallized this concept for me.
We live in a community that judges
one another immediately upon first
encounter - we note the clothes
that someone wears, the color of his
or her skin, the way he or she acts
and, most importantly, how he or

she strays from the "norm." And in
doing so we've created an environ-
ment that is restrictive and stifling.
One that's detrimental to the unique
perspectives and differences each
of us brings to the table. Instead of
creating a community of acceptance
and understanding, we've built a cul-
ture thatstigmatizes any variation of
the "norm" and that barricades some
people from fully immersing them-
selves into our society.
It's not individuals
who need to
change, but
our culture.
Rather than viewing disability
as an individual problem that needs
to be treated with surgery, therapy,
medicine, etc., we need to approach
it from a societal perspective. It's not
individuals who need to change, but
our culture. That involves each and
every one of us - from the aggra-
vated airline attendants on my flight
home to students like you and me.
All across the board a change of per-
spective is warranted.
Some of us may take a bit longer
to complete assignments, use a cane
when walking to class or need audi-
tory assistance. Whatever it is, a
community that's willing to accept
individual differences and work to
accommodate each of us is a much
more productive place to live.

A reaction beyond words

Blindly bl'ming the Greek system

a

Dec. 14 was shaping up to be just another
Friday when reports of a mass shooting sud-
denly took over the media. I was concerned
and saddened, and hoped that it was some-
how a false alarm. But when the death toll
in Newtown, Conn. became known - first 18
children, then 20 children and seven adults -
my concern turned to horror and my sadness
to grief. I asked myself the questions that
anyone with a conscience would have asked:
Why would anyone murder these children?
Could this have been prevented somehow?
How are the families of the victims and those
who survived ever going to recover from such
a terrible event?
The answer to the first question is clearly
mental illness, and there are many potential
answers to the second, but I have no answers
for that last one. I may not know the victims
personally, but my most heartfelt condolences
go out to the their families and community -
thoughIfearthatthesecondolences areworth
very little. I cannot claim to understand what
it's like to be the parent who sent their child to
school in the morning and has now laid them
in the ground. I cannot imagine what one
unidentified girl who evaded Adam Lanza's
bulletsby pretending to be dead must be going
through right now. And I cannot fathom the
reaction of that girl's mother when, though
knowing that her own daughter was safe, had
to hear her say, "Mommy, I'm OK, but all my
friends are dead."
However, Ican fathom the fact that I live in
acountry that's been plagued by 62 mass mur-
ders in the past 30 years, the deadliest among
those murders occurring at a college campus
or school. As of 2011, the homicide rate in the
United States was 6.9 tmes higher than in
other high-income countries. Moreover, over
the last few years, states have been cutting the
budgets for their mental health programs at
alarming rates, leaving some of the most vul-
nerable citizens without the aid they desper-
ately need. Amidst all of this, Congress, the
nation's federal legislative body in the most
powerful position to make real changes, has
done shamefully little. In the last 30 years a

total of four pieces of gun control legislation
have passed through Congress, while the
political power of the National Rifle Associa-
tion has fought every step.
All of this speaks to the now-incontrovert-
ible fact that this country has a hideously
under-addressed gun violence problem that
consistently manifests itself as mass murder.
This is true today, but this was also true on
Dec. 14, 2012. On July 20, 2012. On Feb. 14,
2008. On April 16, 2007. Apparently, the mass
slaughter of 20 first-graders and six of their
teachers is what it takes to catch the attention
of the American people.
There have been many letters and many
prayers offered to console the citizens of
Newtown. None of them, however powerful,
will ever be able to change what happened
that day. But these words carry the potential
for meaningful action aimed at reducing gun
violence in the United States. Efforts like the
commission President Barack Obama formed
and California Sen. Diane Feinstein's prom-
ised bill pertaining to an assault weapons ban
are extremely promising signs of progress.
The latter should contain language that closes
the gun show loophole, which allows virtually
anyone to buy a gun without going through a
background check. In addition, this bill places
a ban on clips with a capacity of more than 10
bullets, the likes of which Lanza used in his
attack. The commission, meanwhile, should
consider the state of America's mental health
care system and the stigma surrounding men-
tal illness while crafting its proposal.
Mass murder has visited this country for
the 62nd time in 30 years, but this time our
reaction as a nation needs to go beyond mere
words. Too many words have been said in the
past with too little corresponding action, and
this nation should be tired of hearing stories
like that of the unidentified little girl. The
time is ripe for addressing mass murder as a
matter of policy instead of once again dismiss-
ing it as an inexplicable act that no one can
foresee or prevent.

instincts of the
Jewish people to those of a rat -
all the while puffing away on an
oversized tobacco pipe. It really is
the little things that make a Quen-
tin Tarantino movie special.
Little things and violence -
pulpy, whimsical, hilarious vio-
lence.
And if you've seen Taranti-
no's latest masterpiece "Django
Unchained," you'll know there's
just something inexpressibly
special about watching a woman
fly 10 feet in the wrong direction
after taking a single bullet from
an old-fashioned six-shooter.
Over the last two decades, it's this
quirky take on violence, almost
comic book-like in its exaggera-
tion, that has allowed the world's
most knowledgeable director to
use buckets of pasty faux blood to
mold a genre of his own.
A genre in which the extrava-
gant displays of ferocity are
skillfully framed by beautiful,
self-referential lines of dialogue
and light-hearted contexts to
pay homage to the most forgot-
ten corners of B-movie history.
"Django" is an undeniable prod-

uct of this genre. In so many
words, it is Tarantino's love let-
ter to the classic Sergio Corbucci
spaghetti western, featuring the
same recognizable Southern set-
ting and the same stereotypical
N-word-spewing, gun-slinging
Southern folk.
But there's a catch.
The two main characters, as
can be expected.of any Tarantino
production, are written specifi-
cally to stick out of this osten-
sibly well-trodden background.
The first is Dr. King Schultz
(Christoph Waltz, "Inglourious
Basterds"), a bounty hunter hired
by the national government to dis-
patch known criminals and sell
their corpses for sizable rewards.
Naturally, he's also a German ex-
dentist with perfectly manicured
fingernails and a soft spot for
slaves.
On a routine mission to locate
and execute three ex-cons, our
smooth-talking European friend
needs the help of a recently sold
slave to identify his three targets.
Enter "D-J-A-N-G-O ... the D is
silent" (Jamie Foxx, "Collateral"),
Tarantino's take on those 19th-
century cowboys found in early
Clint Eastwood westerns. Except,
of course, this cowboy is black,
and represents the hand of bloody
African-American revenge, much
in the same way the Basterds sym-
bolized a collective Jewish ven-
geance in "Inglourious Basterds."
Django is later freed by Schul-
tz, who helps transform him into
the "fastest gun in the south,"
finally agreeing to assist in locat-
ing and freeing his enslaved wife,
Broomhilda (Kerry Washington,
"The Last King of Scotland").
Unlike most other Tarantino
films, "Django" does not feature
many strong female characters.
Disappointingly, Broomhilda
is really nothing more than a
damsel in distress, visions of her
pretty face and simple demeanor

frequently appearing on screen
to beckon our hero forward,
towards old Mississippi's version
of hell on earth.
In this hell, the devil's throne
is occupied by Calvin Candie,
played by Leonardo DiCaprio
("Inception") as a perfect rep-
resentation of vicious white
bigotry, served with a side of
loquacious southern hospitality.
The right-hand man is the head
house slave, brought to life in
scene-stealing fashion by Samuel
L. Jackson ("Pulp Fiction"), who
quickly comes to represent the
mental manacles of slavery that
Django has to overcome on his
path to liberation.
Like in any good western,
when the good meets the bad,
things go boom. But it's clear Tar-
antino is going for something a
lot more ambitious with this film.
Yes, he's still that kid working at
the video store, waxing lyrical
about the movies he finds genu-
inely entertaining, but he's no
longer just concerned about mak--
ing obscure pop references and
getting that occasional knowing'
chuckle out of audience members.
Tarantino, now having made
eight feature-length films, has,
grown as a writer and director.
In "Django," the scenes of vehe-
ment retribution are aplenty and
all wholly satisfying. Butthe truly
memorable ones feature a form of
writing that puts on full, ugly dis-
play the saddening excuses igno-
rant men hid behind to justify
slavery.'
The scenes of Django riding
desperately towards his wife, his
last chance at something nor-
mal dwindling in front of him as
flecks of dust ripple off the tat-
tered rags around his shoulders,
make you want to stand up and
applaud. And when the credits
roll, the applause comes. Finally,
for once, it's not just for the little
things.

Christmas specials fail

when holiday season closes PoicyTalks

By MAX RADWIN
Daily Fine Arts Editor
This holiday season, I did
something that I have never done
before: I watched "Frosty the
Snowman" afterDec 25. In fact, it
was the 27. My father had already
begun to dismantle our tree, and
I was looking ahead to my plans
for New Year's Eve. But I noticed
the special on our DVR and I've
watched it every other year of my
life so I figured, heck, why not?
I have to tell you, it's not good.
I can confidently say that it's
a bad half-hour of television.
Nothing happens, really, except
a bunch of kids take a hat that
isn't theirs, a girl gets cold and
then Jimmy Durante sings over
the credits.
That's when it hit me: Every
Christmas special, ever, is awful.
What baffles me is that I
never realized it until now. It
never occurred to me that those
specials could ever be considered
not good until I came across one
out of its element. I've always
watched them in a context of

Wolverines hounded in blowout
defeat to lowly Bowling Green

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Editor
The Michigan hockey team's
matchup against Bowling Green
was never expected to be per-
fect. But it should have been an
improvement.
Junior defenseman Jon Mer-
rill was starting for the first time
since his fractured vertebrae put
him out for the first half of the sea-
son. Freshman defenseman Jacob,
Trouba was back in the linup after
return-
ing from BGSU 5
the World MICHIGAN 1
Junior
Championship. And junior goal-
tender Adam Janecyk seemed to
be emerging as the frontrunner
behind the crease.
But to put it, gently, nothing
quite worked out the way the Wol-
verines expected in the Falcons'
5-1 trouncing of Michigan.
"I don't know what the break
did for some teams, butI can't say
it helped our team," said Michigan
coach Red Berenson. "We've been
struggling defensively and we're
still struggling defensively."
Bowling Green (3-7-1 CCHA,
6-10-5 overall) took an early lead
in the first period when Janeyck's
blocked shot rebounded off to the
side and was tapped in at the edge
of the crease. And the Wolverines
barely had time to recover when
the Falcons beat Janecyk five-hole
from the slot just minutes later.
Sophomore defenseman Bren-
nan Serville was ushered to the
locker room after hitting his head
on the boards and injuring his
shoulder. Bowling Green's Brent
Tate received- a game miscon-
duct, and Michigan (4-8-2, 7-11-
2) went on the first power play of
the night. Though the Wolverines
-were better at controlling the puck
in the Falcons' zone, they were
still unable to register any quality
shots at net.
Serville's absence hit an already
troubled blue line especially hard,
leaving just five players in the
rotation. Berenson said the defen-
semen looked sleepy during some
of Bowling Green's goals. The

players begto differ.
"Losing Brennan, he's abig part
of our (defensive)-corps (but) no
excuses," said senior defenseman
Lee Moffie. "A guy goes down,
we're ready for that, we do condi-
tioning for that."
In fact, Bowling Green looked
revitalized coming off its five-
minute major keeping the puck in
front of Janecyk as the first frame
wound down. Kevin Lynch took
a cross-checking penalty in the
waning minutes, putting Michi-
gan back on the defensive.
At the start of the second peri-
od, it seemed as if the Wolverines
had finally begun to find its legs.
Junior forward Luke Moffatt redi-
rected in a slapshot from junior
defenseman Mac Bennett to tally
his first goal of the year and begin
to reduce the goal deficit.
Though Michigan final-

ly started swarming around
Bowling Green goalie Andrew
Hammond and had ample oppor-
tunities around the net, the puck
just wasn't going in for them.
It did, though, go in for Bowling
Green - when the puck slipped
through Janecyk's legs, Ryan Car-
penter was the only player in the
vicinity. A quick tap in, and the
Falcons regained a two-goal lead,
shortly followed by another soft
goal to put them up 4-1 entering
the final frame.
"It's harder to score when you
need to score, but we've (come
from behind) before," Berenson
said. "We had a couple of attempts,
but we didn't play enough in their
zone. (Bowling Green played)
with a lot more enthusiasm than
we were and that's disappointing."
Freshman Steve Racine took
over goalie duties for the third

stanza, though the swap didn't
do much to change the Wolver-
ine's fortune - Bowling Green
still notched a fifth goal on a quick
wraparound, and Michigan never
came close to finding any offen-
sive firepower necessary for clos-
ing the gap. It certainly didn't help
morale any when Bennett went
down late in the period with a
lower body injury.
The decision to switch Janecyk
for Racine was as much to do with
the game stretching further out
of reach as it was with Janecyk's
poor play, and the starting posi-
tion still remains up in the air.
"I was hoping that (Janecyk)
would give us a better game and
(then) the puck went in too easy,"
Berenson said. "We need our
goalie to play better and we need
to jump start our team and some-
times, a goalie can do that."

I wonder.
I wonder why the
Michigan hockey team
can't win.
I wonder why, with a health-
ier squad and in front of a home
crowd, the Wolverines still
couldn't find their rhythm.
I wonder if a 5-1 loss to the
ninth-place team in the CCHA,
Bowling Green, is enough to
wake up an unenthusiastic
squad.
"We're
all looking
for that
one spark
to get '
this team
going,"
said senior
defense- GREG
man Lee GARNO
Moffie.
"Right
now that's hard to come by for
whatever reason."
Could it be the defensive
struggles contributing to the
multiple recent blowouts,
struggles that reocurred Tues-
day, highlighted by the third
goal that slipped behind goal-
tender Adam Janecyk?
Trailingby one with momen-
tum in its favor, Michigan
failed to leave a defender by
the net. As the puck slid behind
Janecyk, he looked for someone
to knock it away. He looked for
a defender to save the game
from spiraling out of control.
Instead, there was Bowling
Green's Ryan Carpenter, skat-
ing uncovered to the net to flip
the puck in.
Missing sophomore defense-
man Brennan Serville because
of an injury early in the game,
the Wolverines played from
behind with one less teammate,
but that doesn't feel like the
explanation.
Michigan was playing with
two strong pairings in front of
him, led by the return of fresh-
man defenseman Jacob Trouba
and junior defenseman Jon
Merrill.
But the duo failed to lock
down a Falcon offense that has
scored just 39 goals while giv-
ing up 54. Instead, there was
Trouba skating down the ice
with the puck in the second
period, opting not to clear it
into the opposing zone.
Many times during the
night, Michigan found itself
stuck in its own zone, unable to
escape the pressure that ceased
to stop.
"Our defense looked tired,"
said Michigan coach Red'
Berenson.
Added Moffie: "As far as
playing tired, we have no
excuses."
But I wonder why the
defensive struggles are compli-
mented by the offensive short-
comings that seem to doom the
Wolverines when they need a
boost of momentum.

Down 4-1 in the third period,
Michigan saw a golden oppor-
tunity to grab a goal back and
show a sign of life. Sophomore
forward Travis Lynch streaked
do'wn the ice on a breakaway,
left with only the goalie to
beat.
His attempt failed, though,
as Bowling Green's Andrew
Hammond easily shoved the
puck aside.
Lynch isn't the only culprit.
Sophomore forward Zach
Hyman had opportunities and
junior forward Luke Moffatt
also had his chance.
Although the Wolverines
were without their captain and
offensive catalyst, senior center
A.J. Treais, they still failed to
record more than three shots in
the third period.
"Sometimes the puck doesn't
go in." Berenson said. "It's
harder to score when you need
to score when you're playing
from behind, but we've done
that before."
I wonder if improved play
on special teams or Janecyk's
inability to put together consis-
tent play could have been the
difference.
An extended power-play
chance, a five-minute major,
looked like an easy way for
Michigan to end its slump. Yet
the Falcons made easy work
of the attempt, sending pucks
back to the other end of the
rink.
Yet, when the Wolverines
needed stops, Janecyk was
unable to make the neces-
sary plays, letting the easy
rebounds, the surefire stops, -
go itt. Many of Bowling Green's
goals weren't the result of a
pretty shot or a well-timed
wrister, they were the product
of sloppy play in front of the
net.
Janecyk isn't the only one
of Berenson's four goaltenders
left to blame. It's no secret that
the Wolverines are letting in
a number of goals, but Tues-
day proved that something is
needed to sparkithe struggling
group of netminders.
Still, I'm left wondering if
there is something beyond the
physical play.
The enthusiasm Michigan
lacked in its past games, like
Friday's exhibition loss to the
United States National Team
Under-18 Development Pro-
gram, carried over into Tues-
day's contest.
When the puck needed to
be cleared or a pass needed to
slide in, the Wolverines were
sluggish.
I wonder what Michigan will
do to remedy its slump and play
consistent hockey, reminiscent
of previous years.
I wonder if this is rock bot-
tom.

Final drive dooms
'M' in Outback Bowl

By LUKE PASCH
Daily Sports Writer
TAMPA, Fla. - In Tuesday's
Outback Bowl, the Gamecocks
sprung up early and finished on
top to spoil the Wolverines' New
Year's Day.
Down 27-28, No.11 South Caro-
lina started its last drive of the
game with three and a half min-
utes left on the clock. The quarter-
back combo of Connor Shaw and
Dylan Thompson led a meticulous

line, putting
the Gamecocks in field goal range.
But instead of settling for three,
Thompson caught the Wolverine
secondary napping and hit Bruce
Ellington in front of the goal
line. The receiver sidestepped a
defender and crossed the plane
with 11 ticks left.
After the kickoff, Michigan
quarterback Devin Gardner's hail
mary attempt as the clock expired
was tipped on the release, and that
was the ball game - South Caro-
lina trumped Michigan on New
Year's Day, 33-28.
"Very proud of our seniors and
very proud of our kids that par-
ticipated and came down here
and how the guys have worked all
year," said Michigan coach Brady'
Hoke. "We've got a long way to
go as a football program and as a
football team, but our seniors con-
tinued to lay some groundwork
and a foundation."
Though the Michigan defense
came into the Outback Bowl
ranked second in the country in
pass defense, it had trouble stop-
ping South Carolina's big passing

he looked right back at my eyes
and said, 'You're the best tackle

great compliment to have."
Tuesday also marked the last
time fans will get to see their
already legendary quarterback,
Denard Robinson, don the maize
and blue. Throughout the game, he
was used much in the same way as
he was toward the end of the sea-
son, lining up mostly at tailback
or quarterback, and occasionally
in the slot. He attempted his first
pass since playing at Nebraska on
Oct. 27 in the third quarter, but
it was incomplete, intended for
Dileo in the flat. That was his only
pass attempt of the game.
Robinson completed the final
performance of his Michigan
career with 100 rushing yards,
and he surpassed Pat White as the
all-time NCAA leading rusher for
a quarterback, with 4,495 yards.
"I know I'm going to remem-
ber the downs and ups," Robinson
said. "It's always goingto be a bit-
tersweet feeling because I'm leav-
ing. (Michigan) was my home for
four years."

TAMPA, Fla. -
ven after it was over,
Denard, you made three
strangers smile.
After the miracle attempt
failed and the clock ran out
Tuesday, after South Carolina
pulled out a 33-28 victory in the
final seconds, you walked to the
middle of the field and shook
hands.
For once,
you didn't
smile.o
A group
of three sta-
dium staffers
approached
you with ZACH
a camera HELFAND
phone. It was
4:44 p.m.,
two minutes
after your career ended. The
pain was still fresh - you hadn't
even made it off the field. Yet,
at your lowest point, you posed
with them for a photo.
One last memory.
Thirty-seven minutes later,
at your press conference, you
talked about memories, sit-
ting on a black plastic chair in
a dim concrete alcove beneath
Raymond James Stadium. On
the cinderblock wall above your
head, on laminated paper, some-
one had scrawled "16 Robinson"
in red dry-erase marker, as if a
reminder were necessary. Here,
still no smile, just downcast looks
and shiny glass eyes.
"I want (the fans) to remember
whatever they want to remem-
ber," you said. "The ups and
downs."
They already do. They remem-
ber the little things.
A teacher from western New
York took his friends to their
first Michigan game. It was your
first too. You fumbled a ball and
picked itup and ran for a touch-
down. They've been fans ever
since.
A law student watched your
freshman year, and at first, he
thought you were just a speedy
athlete. Then he saw the look
onyour face after you threw a

game-ending interception at
Iowa. He saw how devastated
you were; he saw how much you
cared. From that moment on, he
cared too.
Ups and downs.
A sophomore watched your
improbable win over the Irish
two years later. After your game-
winning pass to Roy Roundtree,
he felt like he was swept up in
awave, like the student sec-
tion had swollen and burst. He
hugged weepingstrangers.
Everyone has his oxyn photo-
graph of your career.
The reporters asked questions
about your legacy. You said you
don't know what it should be.
These four years were long
and messy. How do you condense
four years into a neat picture?
How do you define a legacy?
Sometimes your crazy scram-
bles worked. Sometimes they
didn't. But like the law student,
we cared because you cared.
Because you danced with us at
basketball games. Because you
were oneeofv.
We cared because when there
wasn't much to be excited about,
you supplied the excitement. As
Desmond Howard said of you
Tuesday, "The whole nation,
when they watched him play, just
kind of held their breath."
It was messy, but that's okay.
We don't need to define you. We
have our memories.
As you talked, nearby, your
teammate, Quinton Washington,
described what he'd remember
about your career. It's not just the
plays on the field. It's the effect
you had on people off it.
Just this year, a junior saw you
walking into Angell Hall. You
smiled at everyone as you held
the door for your classmates. You
told her to have a good day, and
she did.
Last year, a senior sat next
to you at the library. Surely you
don't remember him. But he'll
remember forever. You offered
him a piece of your Kit Kat.
Chin up, Denard, we need
your smile.
But we didn't get the goodbye

right, did we? After four years,
10,776 yards and a lot of magic,
your end came on a sideline in
Florida with your helmet in your
hand - watching an offense that
used to be yours - and a photo
with three strangers. A frown
instead of a smile.
In your first game, you did
no wrong. You had the fumble
touchdown on your first carry.
Your last rush, after you set the
NCAA record for rushing yards
by a quarterback, was a three-
yard loss. Your last pass was a
duck.
Your team didn't need you
anymore.
The big plays happened
elsewhere, and often you just
watched, like everyone else: a
Gardner sneak orscramble; a
Jeremy Gallon catch; a Drew
Dileo fake punt.
After the photo, you jogged
toward thetunnel, stopping to
walk off the field with your fel-
low captain and friend, Jordan
Kovacs. You rubbed your hand
overyour.face, adjusting youtr
skull cap, and the Michigan fans,
though still dejected, stood up
and applauded. And then you ran
by thatconcrete slab of an alcove
toward the locker room.
Forty-four minutes later, at
5:28, you got up fromyour plastic
chair after your press confer-
ence and walked up to another
camera. For two minutes, you
answered more questions, and
then you were done.
You walked down the tun-
nel back to the locker room. As
you did, a man holdinga towel
climbed the plastic chair and
wiped off "16 Robinson," until all
that was left of you was a faded
blur.
Soon, the darkness of the
tunnel swallowed you. One day,
maybe, you'll come out clean
on the other side, to the NFL
and beyond. Until then, we'll
wait, watch, hope. And, always,
Denard, we'll remember and
together we'll smile.

One player in particular that

Thompson's prowess from

He said as

"John Beilein has an embar-

Johnson said.
Think back a few years.
When did it become OK to coo

still remembersa raging debate
over whether Michigan fans
should have stormed the court
after the Wolverines, who start-
ed the season ranked 15th, beat
No. 15 Connecticut at Crisler
Arena. That was just less than
four years ago.
That was an embarrassment.
This is something different
altogether.
Michigan is one of the coun-
try's four remaining unbeaten
teams, is ranked No. 2 in the
land and, at 15-0, has started
this well only once before.
The Wolverines face Big Ten

one that may not be eclipsed for
a very, very longtime.

the helm in Ann Arbor, never
even reached the 16-win mark
in his first and third'season on
campus.
An embarrassment of riches.
That seems pretty accurate
for Michigan, ateam winning
by an average of 22.5 points per
game while consistently rotat-
ing five true freshmen onto the
floor. Just look down the bench.
Beilein has more-than-service-
able options two and three deep
at every position.
The Wolverines are two
games into the Big Ten season
and have already registered a
pair of 28-point victories over
Northwestern and Iowa. Sure,
the Wolverines haven't really
been tested by talent on par,
with what else is around the Big
Ten. But they sure haven't fal-
tered, either.
You can't talk Michigan
without mentioning sophomore
floor general Trey Burke, who
has the Wolverines atop the
polls and is making a serious
push to be the favorite in the
national player of the year dis-
cussion, despite not ranking in
the top-five nationally in any
standard statistical category.
Burke is averaging 18.2
points and 7.5 assists per game,
shooting 54.6 percent from the
field and 76.7 percent from the
free-throw line. All good num-
bers. But dig beneath the rigid
statistical surface for a moment
and you'll find what makes this
kid great.
Aside from being the lead-
ing scorer on the No. 2 team
in America, Burke spearheads
perhaps the most balanced
offense in the college game, and
he's distributed the wealth with
hardly a misstep. Managing a
potent transition offense, Burke
averages just 1.9 turnovers per
game for an assist-to-turnover
ratio of 4.04.

To put the numbers into
context, Burke is on pace to
supplant Gary Grant for the
program's assists-per-game
crown. Grant averaged 6.88
assists per game during the
1987-88 season, but he also had
a Michigan-record 150 turn-
overs, resulting in a meager 1.56
assist-to-turnover ratio.
Burke has made dashes to the
basket, beaten defenders off the
dribble and broken ankles with
step-back jumpers.
But he'll tell you that scor-
ing isn't his focus. It's his court
vision that has the Wolverines
as the only 15-0 team in the
nation.
Thanks to Burke, Michigan
has four players averaging
12-plus points per game. If
you tally together the scoring
averages of those four play-
ers - Burke, junior guard Tim
Hardaway Jr., freshman for-
ward Glenn Robinson III and
freshman guard Nik Stauskas
- they alone are good for 60.6
points per game. In Beilein's
five previous seasons at Michi-
gan, his entire teams have never
averaged more than 66.9 or
less than 62.6 points per game.
Today, the Wolverines are aver-
aging 82.0 points.
There's no storming the
court, not just yet. The expec-
tations are a little higher now,
and Michigan has one of the
most exciting teams in the
country in one of the best are-
nas. It's a good time to be in
Ann Arbor.
Pardon the numbers-heavy
analysis, but the tale of the tape
is the best measuringstick for
Michigan. Just ask Gus John-
son.

about his physical growth than his

mately de'cided to burn LeVert's
redshirt.
"He needs another 20

want him to eat) all day long if he

can. We watch what they eat, not
probably pouring over it like you
would a 5-year-old, but we are
watching what he eats."
Before LeVert arrived at Michi-
gan, he wasn't doing much more
than pushups and sit-ups in addi-
tion to his workout, and the fresh-
man said it was a shock to his
body after the first couple weeks
of weights. After many hours in
the cold tub, LeVert has begun to
adapt to intense practices and the
physicality of collegiate play.
. His improvement is a testa-
ment to howall the freshmen have
adjusted to college basketball.
Guard Nik Stauskas easily shot his
way into the starting lineup, but
has shown immense growth in his
ability to drive into the lane and
on the other end of the court, play
solid defense. Also, forward Mitch
McGary has become a legitimate
No. 2 post player for Michigan.
Despite getting into foul trouble
early on this season, McGary has
learned to control his body bet-
ter and has gained muscle to keep
up with the physicality of Big Ten
play.
So LeVert, the other freshmen
and the rest of the second-ranked
Wolverine squad are prepared
for the fast-paced offense that
Nebraska (0-2 Big Ten, 9-6 over-
all) will bring to Crisler Center
tonight (7 p.m., Big Ten Network).
Though their record may be
underwhelming, the Cornhuskers
run a fast-paced offense that relies
heavily on their transition game,
while their defense has held oppo-
nents to an average of 61 points

per game. Seniors Dylan Talley
and Brandon Ubel lead Nebraska's
offense that has three players con-
sistently scoring in double figures.
Beilein called Nebraska a "very
different" challenge.
"We went from a Northwest-
ern challenge, which is extremely
unique (to) the way Iowa played
us, they came out pressing us right
away," Beilein said. "Now we're
going into almost like a Wiscon-
sin-type of prep as far as what they
do defensively - very contain-
ing, going to make us make tough
(2-pointers), get out on us pretty
good. We've got to adjust again to
a different team."
For the Wolverines (2-0, 15-0),
who rely heavily on their youth,
Beilein is wary that this transition
- three different styles of play
from each Big Ten opponent in just
a week - may be tough both men-
tally and physically on his team.
Michigan's offense, which
scored a program record for
points in a conference game with
95 against Iowa on Sunday, may
be slowed down a bit by Nebras-
ka's defense, and Beilein hopes
his players are prepared to make
in-game adjustments and not get
frustrated.
"(The Cornhuskers are) going
to minimize possessions for both
teams and that maximizes the
team's chances to win," Beilein
said. "If that's the strategy
they're going to use, we have to
adapt. They're looking to shorten
games, stay in the game, and they
can beat you if you're not on your
game."

Behind Enemy Lines: Q&A
with Nebraska's Tim Miles

ByEVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor,
Tim Miles strolled to the
podium in Chicago, sat down and
smiled. As the first-year coach of
Nebraska, this was his first Big
Ten Media Day, but Miles didn't
show it. He cracked jokes, poked
fun and ended his press confer-
ence with a panoramic photo of
the media in the room that then
went out to his large Twitter fol-
lowing.
Miles is the new man in charge
of a Nebraska team that won just
four conference games and fin-
ished dead last in the Big Ten last
year, but he looked like a coach
that was more thanicomfortable in
Chicago.
Lost in all the hoopla was that
Miles is actually a pretty darn
good basketball coach. He was
hired away from Colorado State,
where he had been since 2007. In
his first season there, the team
won seven games. In his last sea-
son in Colorado, the team won 22
games and reached the second
round of the NCAA Tournament.
Not just a personality, Miles is
slowly pulling Nebraska :(0-2 Big
Ten, 9-6 overall) out of the cellar.
It tookthe Cornhuskers until Jan-
uaryi11last year to reach nine wins
- this year, they reached nine
wins in late December.'Nebraska

travels to Ann Arbor tonight for
its biggest test of the season, No. 2
Michigan (2-0,15-0).
At Big Ten Media Day, Miles sat
down with the Daily to discuss the
upcoming season.
The Michigan Daily: What
places are you looking forward to
playing at?
Tim Miles: I'm. just excited
to be part of the Big Ten. I think
they are all going to be great envi-
ronments. I just have to find some
good lunch spots, because I had
the Mountain West down.
TMD: Is one of the exciting
parts about being in this confer-
ence knowing there is going to be
a challenge every night?
TM: I think it's a great weight-
loss method. I used to call it the .
Rams basketball diet back in Col-
orado - watch us play, feel like
puking for a week. You won't eat,
you won't drink, you won't do any-
thing. I just hope it goes well, and
I think it's going to be a grueling,
punishing season. But I think also,
when you have an opportunity to
compete with the best, you are
going to get better too. I look for-
ward to building our program all
the same.
TMD: Do you feel like there's a
culture change that has to happen
with this program?
TM: It's hard for me to say
because I can only talk about the

element I'm in and what I deal
with every day with our guys. I
do know there are some things we
need to acclimate to. That matters
most to me, thatcevery day interac-
tion, how we behave and how we
are going to perform before we
start involving the competition.
TMD: You've been moving up
the coaching ranks, do you feel
like you are at the top now?
TM: I really do feel like I'm in
the best conference in the country.
I look at fan support, quality of the
coaches, the way the teams play -
how productive they are, and they
are all well coached. They all have
amazing home environments and
venues, and they all have great
players. It's fun though, because I
think we have a great thing going
here and it's fun to be a part of.
TMD: How excited are you to
just start playing and see where
your team is at?
TM: Finally, you get to do your
job! Between today and March
24 (when Miles was hired) seems
like a lifetime ago. It's not like
you get to play golf all summer
and mess around. We tried to put
Nebraska basketball on the fore-
front and build a brand a little bit.
It's just amazing that journey and
how much life has been lived in
this short amount of time. Now
we finally get to do what we are
here to do.

brain to operate at a greater effi-

us to do things like strategize and

we try to alter these habits, it

half-hearted attempts to go to the
gym or cut back on Internet time.
So how much energy, exactly?
Well, according to a recent study,
it took subjects a median of 66
continuous days to form new
habits that replaced the old ones.
That means if your New Year's

When you go back to a place, a person or
a thing years later, a looming fear arrives
that that person, place or thing won't bethe
same. In case you don't recall, it was g-o-o-

d. This fear comes in varying shapes and
sizes but now you are different, and "it" is
inherently different, also. Scary prospect,
no? Yes.
In my lifetime I have experienced this
fear with Ortega's bean-and-cheese burrito
of La Jolla, Calif., with Tia, who became my
best friend at age three, with driving, with
"Friends" episodes, with orgasm - and the
list blurs ahead. The return to these people,
places and things has ranged from painfully
disappointing to sensational in its parallel
of past joy. And, on rare occasion, the pres-
ent form trumps its predecessor.
January 3, 2013, I stepped back into
Gaga.
Let's take a quick pause for the 99-per-
cent that think I am talking about partici-
pating in a how-to-be-a-stunner class from
the singing, dancing Lady of all ladies. Not
true. My 'Gaga' is from Tele Viv, Israel.
This dance technique that has you melt
your bones with your brain is referred to as
"Gaga," created by the artistic director of
Batsheva Dance Company, Ohad Naharin.
In Israel, many non-dancers as well as pro-
fessional and pre-professional dancers take
this class, but it seems to be mostly "Gaga
for dancers" in the U.S.
From the outside, Gaga might look like
some fusion of modern dance, improvisa-
tion or interpretive dance. And what it
looks like typically equates to what it is,
but a key facet of Gaga is that Naharin cre-

ated this technique to be practiced and
experienced with the intention of find-
ing pleasure through effort and fluidity in
your spine. Every single body in class is in
motion for the entire sixty minutes, no one
is allowed out or in of the mirror-less room,
no one is allowed to sit and watch. And it's
not performed, but rather, influences the
movement the Batsheva Dance Company
performs. We are reminded to have a "sense
of plenty of time" throughout the hour. We
could do this all day. All year.
"We," almost four years ago, meant a
bunch of eighteen year olds at a summer
intensive program - mostly female- try-
ing to act, and dress, less ballet. My body
became a foreign, beautied body. The
month concluded and I emerged an addict
of the quake, the little circles and that pool
of water.
Fast forward a few earth rotations
around that big ol' sun and I am on winter
break of my senior year as a Dance major
at University of Michigan, walking into
the same upstairs studio space in SoMa,
San Francisco. A young lady who belongs
to their year-round program buzzes herself
in; I follow behind, make elevator small talk
and mosey into the studio after her.
... Deep inhale.
Never have I ever entered a room with so
manyvibes.
Seriously. Do you know what I mean?
Everybody and their mother were expel-

ling vibes. And these were the vibey type of
vibes. The following words come to mind:
pretentious, intimidating, Sun Salutation
buffs, expertly cut t-shirts, trendy hair,
even trendy spinal curvature. This world
was their home, and they knew it.
Let's get real: here were twenty-five
beautiful humans with clean faces and
hearts beneath their expertly cut t-shirts
... and they were welcoming me into their
tightly woven community. Important fact: I
did pay the people $15. No tax, though. "m
For those sixty minutes I burned some
calories, found a slightly new movement
dynamic (FYI, this is a big deal), felt my
omelet and coffee go for a rough ride, and
closed my eyes to the physical curiosity
abounding within the four walls of the stu-
dio.
Amidst my reflection of a fleeting return-
to-Gaga, Mike Birbigilia's quote in the
recent comedy "Sleepwalk With Me" came
to mind: "The first time you fall in love, it's
such a transcendental feeling, you know?
It's like eating pizza-flavored ice cream."
I wouldn't call my experience transcen-
dental, nor did it much resemble the Gaga of
my nostalgic mind. But it is quite the feeling
to be pleasantly surprised by people, and
by a Tour de Mind & Body at the price of a
Zingerman's sandy.

Inp

t a new year and a fresh season for
news. What's ahead for the campus and
Ann Arbor community? Here's what
headlines you should look out for in 2013.
Around Ann Arbor
Students may have more options when
doing basic shopping later this year as Wal-
greens plans to open a store in the former
OtMichigan Book & Supplies building on the
corner of South State and South University
Streets. While a convenient location, stu-
dents have voiced concerns about having
a CVS Pharmacy, 7-Eleven and now Wal-
greens - all national chains - within a one-
block radius.
Several high-end apartment buildings
in downtown Ann Arbor will join Zaragon
and Landmark. The Varsity, located on East
Washington will cater to students and open
in June. Meanwhile, Blimpy Burger is still
looking for a new home after the University
announced plans to purchase the property.
City Council
Internal fluxes in the Ann Arbor City
Council mean changes for the city. The
council added three new members, includ-
ing Chuck Warpehoski (D-Ward 5), Sally
Hart Petersen (D-Ward 2) and Sumi Kailasa-
pathy (D-Ward 1). Additionally, veteran City

Council members Margie Teall (D-Ward
4) and Christopher Taylor (D-Ward 3) and
Mayor John Hieftje were re-elected to
their seats this term. Council members will
likely address the county's participation in
the Southwest Regional Transit Author-
ity signed into law by Republican Gov. Rick
Snyder in December. After the City Coun-
cil opted out of the Washtenaw Ride in
November, the city will likely dismiss fur-
ther attempts from the state to form a cross-
county transportation network.
Absent from the city this year are public
art installations. This is a change from pre-
vious years in which public art projects have
been organized and displayed at locations
around the city, including near the Ann
Arbor Public Library, in West Park and in
front of the City Hall. After voters decided
against a proposal for a public arts tax -
which would create a new program making
it easier to show off temporary pieces of art
- the council voted to dismantle the cur-
rent program, Percent for Art. The ongoing
public art projects, which may be the last,
include a hanging sculpture in the lobby of
the Justice Center and a rain garden project,
which will be placed at an abandoned prop-
erty on W. Kingsley Street in July or August.
Ann Arbor will have also more wiggle
room, with a $1.3 million surplus expected
in the 2013 budget, according to city offi-
cials. However, City Council members noted
that the city expects higher expenditures in
the future years and the money will likely be

reserved to offset the loss.
University Affairs
The LSA theme for the winter term is
"Race," which was proposed by the Exhibit
Museum of Natural History. This theme
semester centers on the traveling exhibition
at the museum, "Race: Are We So Differ-
ent?" which was organized by the American
Anthropological Associationin partnership
with the Science Museum of Minnesota.
The theme spans several interdisciplinary
courses, from African American Studies to
dance.
The MCubed research program will
continue to announce grant winners in the
upcoming months, putting into motion the
University-funded programs. The grants are
part of a $15-million University initiative to
encourage multi-disciplinary research. The
Twitter account of the University's Office
of the Vice President for Research will ran-
domly post 50 accepted projects at a time.
The Law School reports that most of the
second phase of construction on Hutchins
Hall and the Legal Research Building is
complete, which means that many faculty
members will be able to return to their
offices soon..
In the later part of 2013, East Quad Resi-
dence Hall will open its doors after inten-
sive renovations for the 2013 Fall term,
while South Quad Residence Hall will close

for renovations. The nine-floor dorm will
be adding utilities and improvements to
the cafeteria and first floor. The absence of
South Quad rooms will impact University
Housing options for students.
Administration
In late November, Dartmouth College
announced that University Provost Philip
Hanlon would become their 18th presi-
dent, a serious shake-up for the adminis-
tration. For the University, 2013 brings the
appointment of four new deans in the first
quarter of the year. A search committee
will be created to look for a new president
of the University as Mary Sue Coleman's
contract expires in June 2014. The Univer-
sity's Board' of Regents has also scheduled
the consideration and approval of tuition
increases, which may happen in June.
The Coalition for Tuition Equality -
a student group dedicated to improving
tuition policies for undocumented students
- will also announce the results of talks
with University administration in February.
The group, which protested at the Regents
meeting on Dec. 12, is asking the adminis-
tration to provide equal access to education
by granting in-state tuition to many undoc-
umented students from Michigan. Univer-
sity Spokesperson Rick Fitzgerald said the
regents expect to receive a report on tuition
equality from the group in January.

he didn't have
to miss any
of the game,"
Swaroop said.
When the
game resumed,
her father turned
the hospital room
television to catch the
second half, cradling his
newborn baby at the same
time.
Earlier this month, Swa-
roop - who said Michigan
football has forever been a part of her family
- watched a game from a different vantage
point than her usual sixth-row seat in the stu-
dent section. This time, she traveled to Flor-
ida, where she attended the Outback Bowl
with her brother Alok, a University alum.
They weren't alone.
ON THE ROAD

It's a familiar story to Engineering senior
Kanchan Swaroop, though she'll never-
remember experiencing it.
On Sept. 14, 1991, quarterback Elvis Grbac
led Michigan to a thrilling 24-14 victory over
then-No. 7 Notre Dame at the Big House.
It was a career day for Grbac, who com-
pleted 20 of his 22 pass attempts - none more
famous than his toss to eventual Heisman
Trophy winner, wide receiver Desmond How-
ard. That play, known simply as "The Catch,"
involved Howard laying out in the end zone to
seal the win on fourth down.
The win breathed new life into a season
that would culminate in a Rose Bowl berth
for the Wolverines. And a stone's throw from
Michigan Stadium at the University Hospital,.
Swaroop took her first breaths.
Many students at the University claim to
have been Wolverine fans since birth. Swa-
roop can say so quite literally.
At halftime of the game, with Michigan
leading 17-7, Swaroop was born.
"It was perfect timingfor-(my dad) because

together as Michigan's bowl picture became
clearer, other students, such as LSA junior
Michael Wick, had theirs fall apart as the
season wore on.
After Brendan Gibbons connected on a
38-yard field goal to give the Wolverines the
win over Michigan State in October, Wick
and his father perused the team's remaining
schedule.
"It became a reality that we could go to the
Rose Bowl," Wick said.
The Wicks knew from experience that
tickets and flights become far more expen-
sive after the bowl berths are officially
handed out in early December. Last sea-
son, they booked a Sugar Bowl package the
day before the announcement came that
Michigan would meet Virginia Tech in New
Orleans. Wick felt comfortable enough in the
experts' bowl predictions to give the trip a
green light.
According to Wick, he and his dad pur-
chased round-trip flights to New Orleans
for about $700. In the coming days, with the
Wolverines formally heading to the Bayou
and their plane tickets already purchased,
they watched as the prices skyrocketed to
well over $1,000. Eventually, the flights sold
out.
That's why the Wicks decided to buy their
flights to Pasadena, Calif., as well as a hotel
early on in the 2012 football season.
"We knew Michigan fans in the state
of Michigan would want to go because it's
'The Granddaddy of'Em All,"' Wick said.
"After Michigan State, we made the deci-
sion because we looked at the schedule and

nately, we got a little surprise at Nebraska."
One week after the Wolverines edged their
in-state rival, they traveled to Lincoln, Neb.
to face the Cornhuskers. The offense failed
to show up for the tough road task, and the
Rose Bowl hopes were, for the most part,
derailed.d
The Wicks continued to scan prices for
a bowl trip, this time looking at the Florida
bowls - Capital One and Outback - as the
more likely destination for the Wolverines.
But after Michigan fell to Ohio State in the
season's final week, all bets were off. Wick
and his dad would be home for the holidays..
"It kind of left a sour taste in his mouth,"
Wick said of the loss to the Buckeyes.
Wick believes that a large part of the
appeal of traveling to a bowl game comes
from the Bowl Championship Series. With-
out it, there is less incentive to make travel
plans.
"In other bowls, you might not be playing
great opponents," Wick said. "As far as I'm
concerned, a BCS bowl shows you had a great
season."
For Swaroop, driving to Florida from her
parents' home in Maryland allowed her to
avoid the holiday airline hikes in her pursuit
of the maize and blue.
Swaroop estimated that she spent about
$350 on gas driving to Orlando, where she
stayed with her maize-and-blue bleed-
ing family, to Tampa, where the game was
played, and back to Maryland. Swaroop
also spent about $50 on food during her trip.
south and at the bowl game. Staying over at a
friend's house helped her save money.

ticket, and Swaroop spent a grand total of
$565 to see the Wolverines play away from
the Big House's friendly confines for the first
time in her life. (She once thought of travel-
ing to Columbus for an Ohio State game, but
was deterred because of potentially hostile
crowds.)
Others;like LSA sophomore Michael Pus-
kar, who described himself as an avid Michi-
gan football fan, said he considered traveling
to the Outback Bowl, but decided against it
after learning the cost it takes to "Go Blue"
out of state.
"If it was the national championship,
maybe," Puskar said. "But the Outback Bowl
- no."
THE ALUMNI ADVANTAGE
Despite the less prestigious bowl bid, the
Michigan fan base continues to travel in num-
bers - just not as large numbers. -
According to Brad Whitehouse, senior
communications coordinator for the Alumni
Association, "there was a big drop" in num-
ber of bowl trip packages sold from last year's
Sugar Bowl game to this year. These packages
include airfare, hotel and a game ticket.
"Historically, the prominence of the bowl
game is a big factor in how many people go, so
it was probably a factor this year too," White-
house said. "This year, we also offered a tour
to the Cowboy Classic (against Alabama in.
Dallas) at the start of the season. That was
a popular trip, and some alumni probably
decided not to go on a second tour in the same
season." .

ciation is exploringnew ways to help students
get to bowl games in the future. But part of
the road-warrior Michigan fan base mental-
ity can certainly be attributed to the world-
wide alumni network.
"One thing about alumni that is obvi-
ous every day at the Alumni Association is
that their feeling of connection to Michigan
doesn't go away after they graduate," White-
house said. "I think it's that strong passion
and pride that make them so willing to go to
bowl games."
In the end, sports are big business. Wolver-
ine passion fills seats in stadiums and rows
on airplanes. Michigan athletics are like a
band, and away games are simply stops on a
tour reaching a devoted, national audience.
Alumni groups, which Michigan has all over
the globe, serve as built-in fan bases, boosting
attendance.
In November, the men's basketball team
took part in the NIT Season Tip-Off at New
York's Madison Square Garden. And while
an NCAA spokesperson said projected atten-
dance figures aren't taken into consideration
when the event's selection committee is
deciding which teams to invite, event orga-
nizers are surely aware that including the
maize and blue can lead to increased hype.
"I would say that 80 to 90 percent of the
fans in attendance (in New York) were Michi-
gan fans," said LSA junior Andrew Dorbian,
who said seeing the Wolverines play in his
home state was "enticing."
Kinesiology junior Dylan Sherwyn, who
attended the NIT Season Tip-Off, said he
believes a combination of sustained athletic

to the willingness of fans to travel.
"Everywhere you go, you can typically find
someone who has a connection to Michigan,"
Sherwyn said.
RUNNING ON SPIRIT
The Maize Rage, the student cheering sec-
tion for the men's basketball team, doesn't
shy away from chances to travel either. Atan
away game against Michigan State in 2010,
the student fan section burst through the
doors of the Breslin Center while chanting
"It's great to be a Michigan Wolverine."'
For Maize Rage president Kevin Starkey,
a Kinesiology senior, who has also been to
Wolverine games at Penn State, Northwest-
ern and Purdue, his position is a job moti-
vated and compensated solely in spirit.
"The Maize Rage is a very close group, and
we enjoy the games as a social event as well
as an experience where we get to cheer for
our favorite team," Starkey said, estimating
he spends between 10 and 12 hours per week
on Maize Rage-related activities. "The board
spends so much time organizing because we

are striving towards becoming the best stu-
dent section in the nation."
At the Frozen Apple Faceoff after Thanks-
giving in New York, a glance at the crowd
would reveal that Cornell hockey fans out-
numbered Michigan hockey fans. But, Cor-
nell is approximately three times closer to
Madison Square Garden than the University
is.
The immense hype that surrounds major
events is too much for many students to
resist. If Michigan loses, as it did in Tampa
on New Year's Day, the students leave with
memories and a souvenir. But the chance to
see a win is what makes these trips so poi-
gnant.
"It was a lot of emotions," Wick said of the
Sugar Bowl celebration in New Orleans. "I
may have started to cry."
Though there was a different result at this
year's bowl game, the sentiment remained
for some.
"It was definitely worth it," Swaroop said
of her trip to Tampa. "It feels good to support
your team even when they're not playing in
the Big House."
