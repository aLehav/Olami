With a new natural gas 

turbine in the works at the 
University 
of 
Michigan, 

environmentalists 
have 

expressed 
concerns 
over 

the 
University’s 
continued 

investment 
in 
fossil 
fuel-

based energy. 

The 
Board 
of 
Regents 

approved 
an 
$80 
million 

expansion 
to 
the 
Central 

Power Plant in March 2017, 
which serves as the main 
source of heat and energy 
for the Central and Medical 
Campus 
buildings. 
The 

project includes the addition 
of a natural gas turbine to the 
plant, which the University 
says will reduce greenhouse 
gas 
emissions 
by 
80,000 

metric tons a year.

According to the University 

press release last year, the 
installation would help get 
the University halfway to its 

2025 goal of reducing campus 
emissions by 25 percent.

“Our targeted greenhouse 

gas emissions reduction is 
an ambitious goal and this 
project marks a significant 
step in the right direction 
as well as providing a sound 
financial projection for the 
university,” Kevin Hegarty, 
chief financial officer, said.

While 
no 
construction 

has 
begun, 
the 
Michigan 

Department of Environmental 
Quality greenlit the project 
over the summer by granting 
the University an air permit 
for the natural gas turbine. 
The permit was granted after 
a required public hearing in 
August.

LSA junior Timothy Arvan 

attended the hearing, along 
with a handful of faculty and 
community members, though 
he recalled no more than 15 
people present. Arvan learned 
of the natural gas turbine over 
the summer while interning 
at the Ecology Center, a non-

Last 

semester, 
University 
of 

Michigan officials put an 
end to the campus tradition of 
Michigan Time. Upon hearing 
the 
initial 
announcement, 

students and faculty voiced 
their concerns but now, with 
a new class of freshmen 
entering campus on the newly 
designed Tower Time, the 
push to reinstate Michigan 
Time is much less prevalent 
but still present.

Michigan Time allowed a 

ten-minute grace period for 
students arriving to class. 
Classes 
would 
start 
ten 

minutes late and end at their 

listed times. 

Under 

the 
new 
Tower 
Time, 

classes start at the time they 
are listed and students are 
excused ten minutes before 
their listed end time.

Many 
ardent 
supporters 

of Michigan Time have been 
bombarding Facebook pages 
with 
Tower 
Time 
memes 

to express their disdain for 
arriving 10 minutes earlier 

to class, while others are just 
waiting for the grumbling to 
end.

Engineering 
senior 
Sam 

Morris 
has 
been 
one 
of 

the 
students 
leading 
the 

fight against Tower Time 

on 
the 
Facebook 
page, 

“Umich 
Memes 
For 

Wolverteens.” He said 
he has not seen many 
students in favor of the 
new system.

“I have not found 

one 
person 
saying 

that they enjoy Tower 
Time,” Morris said. 

“The 
popular 

Facebook 
meme 

page 
‘Umich 

Memes 
for 

Wolverteens’ 
is 
full 
of 

disheartened 
students 
making 
cathartic 
memes about 
the 
death 

of Michigan 
Time. A lot 
of them get 
between 
500 

and 1,000 likes, 
so it’s easy to 

see that the pulse of campus 
is pretty much on the same 
page.”

Morris started an event 

for Monday, Sept. 10, in an 
attempt to have all students 
arrive to class 10 minutes past 
the hour. Morris claims he did 
it partly as a joke, however, 
only 100 of the 15,000 group 

members said they would be 
attending.

Not all students are as 

frustrated with the end of 
Michigan Time. LSA junior 
Emily Furstenberg said she 
was initially surprised about 
the switch, but said it does 
not really affect her daily 
schedule.

“I’m usually a person who 

gets to class early anyways, so 
Tower Time hasn’t affected 
me much,” Furstenberg said. 
“Most people I’ve talked to 
have 
already 
gotten 
used 

to Tower Time and only 
complain about it for 8 a.m. 
classes, which I get.”

When the end of Michigan 

Time was first announced, 
students 
worried 
about 

whether 
professors 
would 

honor the 10-minute early 
dismissal, 
or 
just 
keep 

lecturing. 
Engineering 

sophomore Jeff Yin said the 
only reason professors are 
ending on the scheduled time 
is 
because 
students 
start 

packing up their books.

“The only reason most of 

them let people out 10 minutes 
early is because people just 
start packing up, which makes 
noise,” Yin said. “If people 
don’t do that, professors just 
keep on going.”

Yin 
also 
expressed 

frustration when Tower Time 
was first announced. 

“I was annoyed, shocked 

and sad I suppose,” Yin said. 
“I had only transferred to 
Michigan winter of 2017 as a

Author Leif Wenar introduces his new book, “Blood Oil,” at the Donia Human Rights Center Distinguished Lecture in Weiser Hall Monday afternoon. 

University says natural gas addition 
will reduce greenhouse gas emissions

Leif Wenar addresses crowd at Donia Human Rights Center Distinguished Lecture

More than 70 students and 

faculty 
members 
gathered 

Monday night in Weiser Hall to 
hear Leif Wenar’s lecture titled 
“Blood Oil: Tyrants, Violence, 
and the Rules that Run the 
World.” The lecture, based on 
Wenar’s book, explored the 

history of conflict in nations 
that carry rich oil deposits 
and the “blood oil curse” — an 
idea that mandates if a country 
is present at the time of oil 
discovery and mining, it will 
be involved in political and 
economic decisions involving 
the resource.

Wenar 
is 
the 
chair 
of 

Philosophy and Law at King’s 
College 
London 
School 
of 

Law, in addition to working 

as 
a 
visiting 
professor 
at 

Stanford University, Princeton 
University and the Australian 
National University.

Wenar began his lecture 

by outlining the current state 
of global affairs, tracing both 
national security threats and 
human 
rights 
abuses 
from 

war to failed states with rich 
oil 
deposits. 
He 
explained 

the paradox that arises when 
considering these states hold 

abundant 
natural 
resources 

while also suffering from issues 
of widespread poverty, hunger, 
lack of human rights, armed 
conflict and refugees.

“Our 
governments 
have 

engaged in unjust actions for the 
sake of oil, all over the world, 
for many years, especially in 
the Middle East,” Wenar said. 
“The oil curse is behind the 
news we see all the time.”

Democratic 
gubernatorial 

candidate Gretchen Whitmer and 
running mate Garlin Gilchrist 
spoke to more than 120 students 
Monday night at Lorch Hall 
during a special meeting of the 
University of Michigan’s chapter 
of College Democrats.

Several local elected officials 

including 
U.S. 
Rep. 
Debbie 

Dingell, D-Mich., and state Rep. 
Adam Zemke, D-Ann Arbor, were 
in attendance as Whitmer and 
Gilchrist discussed issues ranging 
from infrastructure and clean 
drinking water to student voter 
turnout and the so-called “blue 
wave” — an anticipated influx of 
liberal candidates to elected office 
in November.

“To have a good life, you gotta 

be able to get into a good job, which 
means a solid education and skills, 
but also, you gotta be able to get 
there, whether it is through public 
transit or through affordable car 
insurance or through roads that 
will get you there safely,” Whitmer 
said. “...Regional transit is critical 
to us making this a state where not 
just businesses but where we have 
a good quality of life.”

profit 
environmental 

organization based in Ann 
Arbor.

The group was notified 

earlier 
in 
the 
summer 

that the University had 
submitted a request for 
an air permit, and began 
to raise questions over 
why the University was 
making such a long-term 
investment into fossil fuel-
based energy.

To voice the Ecology 

Center’s 
concerns, 

Arvan penned a public 
comment 
to 
MDEQ 

on 
the 
organization’s 

behalf 
highlighting 
the 

shortcomings 
of 
the 

University’s proposal and 
asking the department to 
“suspend its assessment 
of the Permit to Install in 
question.”

Arvan’s letter discussed 

the lack of transparency 
in the Board of Regents’ 
decision-making process, 
the project’s commitment 
to 
fossil 
fuels 
over 

renewable energy and the 
lack of the University’s 
environmental leadership 
compared 
to 
its 
peer 

institutions.

“The problem here is 

that they haven’t looked 
at relative alternatives,” 
Arvan said. “So what could 
they do instead of spending 
$80 million on a natural 
gas turbine? Could they have 
explored renewable energy? 
Could they have explored 
various 
alternatives 
that 

could’ve been better for the 
environment and maybe even 
economically?”

Given that MDEQ has no 

regulatory power over the 
University and is compelled 
to 
grant 
the 
air 
permit 

if 
the 
University 
meets 

predetermined criteria for 
natural gas turbines, Arvan 
said the purpose of the public 
comment was to express the 

Ecology Center’s concerns 
and make the issue known 
publicly.

Arvan is concerned by the 

air permit hearing being held 
over the summer when the 
bulk of the student body was 
out of town.

“I think it’s by design that 

this thing kind of flew under 
the radar,” Arvan said.

Given the $80 million cost 

of the project, Arvan insists 
transparency is key.

“One of our concerns is just 

that this is a huge magnitude 

of money,” Arvan said. “It’s 
clearly a big decision and it 
seems like the university did 
a lot of the decision-making 
in private without consulting 
anybody in the community.”

The central concern Arvan 

and 
the 
Ecology 
Center 

have with the natural gas 
turbine is that it commits the 
University to rely on natural 
gas for decades. Meanwhile, 
in a fast-evolving market 
for renewable energy, more 
sustainable 
options 
could 

become more affordable over 

the course of that time.

“Renewables 
are 

becoming more and more 
and 
more 
effective,” 

Arvan said. “This plant 
is basically going to have 
a lifetime of 20 years 
or longer, so what this 
project is is it forces the 
university to commit to 
natural gas for a really 
long time. In that time, 
we 
don’t 
really 
know 

the 
extent 
to 
which 

renewables might become 
even more competitive 
than natural gas.”

LSA 
Earth 
and 

Environmental Sciences 
Professor Adam Simon 
is 
“not 
absolutely 

convinced” 
that 
the 

upgrade is the smartest 
decision 
for 
UM. 
He 

agrees with Arvan that 
the turbine commits the 
university 
to 
natural 

gas for too long, but 
pointed out that there 
isn’t a consensus within 
the 
environmental 

community about whether 
natural 
gas 
is 
more 

sustainable than coal.

“While it is true that at the 

point of combustion, natural 
gas emits less greenhouse 
gases than does coal, that 
is 
only 
when 
emissions 

are counted at the point of 
combustion,” Simon wrote. 
“During mining and transport 
of natural gas, we know that 
fugitive leaks of natural gas 
occur where natural gas leaks 
to the atmosphere.”

Simon 
said 
that 
the 

university does not count 
potential fugitive emissions 
of natural gas, which is 
standard practice. And while 
natural gas is cheap at the 
moment, Simon said its price 
is volatile, and could become 
economically unsustainable.

University officials stand 

behind 
the 
environmental 

sustainability of the Central 
Power 
Plant 
expansion, 

touting its improvement over 
current energy generation.

“The 
new 
15-megawatt 

combustion turbine to be 
added to the power plant 
will reduce the university’s 
overall 
greenhouse 
gas 

emissions by an estimated 
80,000 metric tons per year,” 
University 
spokeswoman 

Kim Broekhuizen wrote in 
an email to The Daily. “That 
is the equivalent of removing 
more than 17,000 passenger 
vehicles 
from 
the 
road 

annually.”

University is looking into 
renewable 
energy 
options 

for 
projects 
other 
than 

the 
Central 
Power 
Plant 

expansion.

“Separate 
from 
this 

project, the university is 
pursuing renewable energy 
options 
through 
power 

purchase 
agreements 
in 

accordance with the 2015 
report,” Broekhuizen wrote. 
“This fall the university will 
further evaluate renewable-
energy options as the next 
step to achieve a 25 percent 
reduction in GHG ahead of 
the 2025 goal.”

In 
Arvan’s 
public 

comment, 
however, 
he 

asserts the University should 
be doing more to pioneer in 
the field of environmental 
sustainability.

“In this age of heightened 

politicization 
of 
the 

environment, 
national 

leadership on issues of climate 
change and energy must come 
from universities; it is both 
the 
fundamental 
purpose 

and 
moral 
imperative 
of 

universities across the globe 
to cultivate groundbreaking 
collaborative 
research, 

encourage 
innovative 

solutions, and inspire the 
next generation of thinkers 
to unleash their potential,” 
Arvan wrote.

Arvan also pointed out 

the University’s decision to 
build a natural gas turbine 
stood out when compared 
to the efforts of the other 
big research institutions on 
environmental sustainability.

“If you look at some of 

the 
similar, 
comparable 

universities to U-M, they’re 
not doing this kind of thing,” 
Arvan said. “There’s nobody 
building 
big 
natural 
gas 

turbines right now. People 
are looking at carbon taxes 
on their campuses. People 
are looking at renewable 
projects and kind of investing 
in the future of the energy 
landscape.”

Wenar 
described 
a 
law 

by which the United States 
and other countries buy oil: 
the law of effectiveness. The 
law stipulates that whoever 
controls the oil by force has 
the right to sell the product, 
leading 
to 
authoritarian 

regimes and armed groups 
taking 
advantage 
of 
these 

regions and profiting from 
production.

“Our money goes back to 

these militias,” Wenar said. 
“We are in legal business 
relationships 
with 
these 

coercive and corrupt actors 
overseas, and for many years 
they’ve been causing a lot 
of trouble with our money. 
This 
archaic 
law 
insights 

oppression and violence. Oil is 
absolute power, and we know 
what happens when people get 
absolute power”

Citing some of the most 

significant 
foreign 
policy 

threats andcrises in last 40 
years, Wenar concluded oil 
interests have always been at 
the root of these issues, and 
U.S policy strategies, such as 
military actions and sanctions, 
have 
been 
insufficient 
in 

preserving peace. He affirmed 
the problem will only get worse 

without reform, especially for 
nations close to the equator 
that will be the first victims 
of the earth’s slow increase 
in temperature from climate 
change.

Wenar said positive change 

is plausible if the U.S abolishes 
the law of effectiveness and 
instead 
institutes 
public 

accountability 
of 
resources 

and 
U.S 
divestment 
from 

companies that buy oil from 
organizations 
that 
abuse 

human rights.

One initiative, developed 

by Wenar himself, is called 
Clean Trade — a charity that 
advocates with governments, 
investors, firms and NGOs to 
implement standards for the 
purchasing of crude oil.

Wenar 
explained 
how 

the law of effectiveness has 
justified 
various 
atrocities 

in the past, such as slavery 
and apartheid, but he said 
these issues were eventually 
outlawed through advocacy. 
Though oil profits have not 
been accounted for by citizens 
of 
these 
countries, 
Wenar 

concluded with an optimistic 
note, claiming it is possible to 
create positive change.

“Insofar as humanity has 

heroes, it’s men like Ghandi 
and Mandela, who fought and 
won the battle for a country 
that belongs to its citizens,” 
Wenar said.

LSA junior Charles Zinn 

expressed his excitement for 
the topic, as well as the ways 
he learned he could advocate 
for 
global 
change 
on 
an 

individual level.

“I came to this lecture 

to learn more about how 
authoritarian regimes benefit 
off of oil and how liberal 
democracies could work to 
combat this issue,” Zinn said. 
“I was satisfied with the 
speaker and his assessment 
of the issue, as well as the 
potential solutions and how 
we can help.”

This lecture, the first event 

of the Donia Human Rights 
Center Distinguished Lecture 
series, was co-sponsored by 
the African Studies Center, the 
Department of Philosophy and 
other University departments. 
Kiyoteru 
Tsutsui, 
director 

of the Donia Human Rights 
Center 
Director, 
explained 

how this series highlights 
both University professors and 
guest speakers.

“Last year we had Carol 

Anderson come in, talking 
about her book ‘White Rage,’” 
Tsutsui 
said. 
”So 
those 

distinguished lectures are held 
a few times a year, we also have 
more younger, up and coming 
scholars and practitioners, all 
while hosting conferences and 
panels.”

freshman. So, to hear such a 
sudden change in policy the 
first semester I was here kind 
of pissed me off.”

LSA freshman Abby Snyder 

said she has heard about 
Michigan Time, but cannot 
understand 
the 
concers 

upperclassmen have.

“It sounds like it could have 

been helpful, especially if you 
oversleep or something like 
that,” Snyder said. “But since 
I never had Michigan Time, 
it’s not an issue for me. I could 
see it being a bigger issue for 
older students who were used 
to it and now have to adjust 
back.”

According 
to 
University 

Provost 
Martin 
Philbert, 

the 
decision 
to 
eliminate 

Michigan 
Time 
had 
been 

a topic of conversation for 
years, but was finally acted 
upon in an effort to unify 
the 
schedules 
across 
the 

University. Schools including 
the School of Nursing never 
adopted 
Michigan 
Time 

because it would conflict with 
the punctuality necessary for 
a career in medicine.

In a previous Daily article, 

Philbert 
said 
the 
switch 

to Tower Time would also 

provide more classroom space 
on campus.

“We have the need for 

more classrooms,” Philbert 
said. “We have more sections, 
which require more rooms, 
and some of these rooms 
require specialized services. 
So, by aligning time, we free 

up the number and types of 
classrooms available.”

Morris 
still 
does 
not 

understand 
why 
the 

University 
administration 

feels the need to take on this 
change.

“Their reasoning to ending 

Michigan Time was mostly 
because they viewed it as 
being ‘for our own good,’” 
Morris said. “But why should 
the 
administration 
decide 

what is best for us? We are 
adults. If an overwhelming 
majority is in support of 
Michigan time, I think our 
opinions should be taken 
seriously.”

He still believes others 

will join him in a resistance 
against Tower Time, and 
says there is a real protest 
in the works.

“I’m in the process of 

organizing a real protest, 
this time posting it to the 
‘University 
of 
Michigan 

Class of 2019, 2020, etc.’ 
Facebook pages so that 
they’re 
taken 
seriously,” 

Morris said. “If enough 
people 
participate 

and 
it 
garners 
enough 

attention, it may cause the 
administration to act.”

According 
to 

Furstenberg, 
other 

students are over it.

“I think the Michigan 

Time meme has run its 

course and, eventually, we’ll 
move onto something else,” 
Furstenberg said.

aware 
that 
operating 
or 

leaving these scooters on City 
sidewalks or leaving them in 
City streets is prohibited and 
subjects violators to citation 
by the City, penalties, and City 
removal of any left scooters.”

City 
officials 
were 
not 

available for comment by the 
time of publication.

A month after the scooters 

originally 
appeared 
in 

Santa Monica, Calif., local 
police had issued almost 100 
citations to users. Melissa 
Overton, public information 
officer of the University of 
Michigan’s Division of Public 
Safety and Security, said on 
Monday the University police 
had not issued any tickets 
involving 
Bird 
scooters. 

Representatives 
from 
the 

Ann Arbor Police Department 
did not respond to requests 
for comment at the time of 
publication.

Users must be 18 or older 

with a credit card and driver’s 
license to operate the scooters. 
The Bird’s electric motor is 
activated through an app, 
and the scooters emit loud 
chirping if moved without 
being activated through the 
app. They do not have to be 
left at a docking station, as 
some 
other 
transportation 

startups require, including 
MoGo bikes in Detroit.

They cost $1 to use, with an 

additional charge of 15 cents 
per minute of usage. The 
scooters are only intended to 
be active from 5:00 a.m. to 
8:00 p.m. 

According to the company’s 

website, 
it 
has 
launched 

operations in at least 41 
cities, including Paris and Tel 
Aviv, Israel. On Aug. 16, Bird 
announced the beginning of 
its “University Pop-Up Tour.” 

“The Bird University Pop-

Up Tour will visit a range of 
large public universities and 
smaller 
private 
colleges,” 

according 
to 
a 
company 

press 
release. 
“Colleges 

and universities interested 
in signing up for the Bird 
University 
Pop-Up 
Tour 

are 
encouraged 
to 
email 

universities@bird.co for more 
information.”

In 
the 
release, 
Bird 

founder 
and 
CEO 
Travis 

VanderZanden said the pop-
ups were designed to address 
the demand for transportation 
in college towns, which “often 
do not have robust public 
transit programs and heavily 
rely 
on 
pollution-emitting 

cars for short-distance trips 
on or around campus.”

“This year, as the summer 

comes to a close and students 
return 
to 
campus, 
they 

might be able to leave their 

cars 
behind 
by 
Birding,” 

VanderZanden 
said. 

“Whether it’s making it to 
a class on time, clocking in 
for work, or simply getting 
to campus from the nearest 

public transit stop, Bird will 
help eliminate transportation 
gaps so students and faculty 
can focus on what really 
matters: education.”

University spokesman Rick 

Fitzgerald 
confirmed 
the 

University had received no 
notice from Bird about the 
deployment of the scooters.

“The Bird scooter company 

did not seek permission from 
U-M regarding the company’s 
deployment of scooters in Ann 
Arbor,” Fitzgerald wrote in 
an email to The Daily. “That 
appears to be the company’s 
approach: 
Not 
seeking 

permission in advance. As 
motorized vehicles, it is my 
understanding that scooters 
are not allowed on campus 
sidewalks and are subject to 
all regulations under U-M 
ordinances as motor vehicles.”

Currently, 
some 
cities, 

including San Francisco, Los 
Angeles and Denver have 
made attempts to ban the 
scooters altogether, but most 
are simply cautioning safety 
and promising to enforce local 
laws if the scooters create 
violations.

Regardless of their future 

in Ann Arbor, students are 
taking 
advantage 
of 
the 

opportunity 
the 
scooters 

present. 
LSA 
junior 
Seth 

Allen had used the scooters in 
Detroit, but was not expecting 
to see them on campus. Since 
Friday, though, Allen has 
signed up to be a charger, 
bringing home scooters at 
night to charge and returning 
them in the morning for 
monetary compensation –– a 
position for which “there’s not 
really a screening process,” 
Allen said. After reading a 
three-page set of instructions 
on how to be a charger, Allen 
sent the company his address 
and is now waiting to receive 
the charging equipment.

Gilchrist, 
who 
runs 
the 

University’s Center for Social 
Media Responsibility, focused on 
student voter turnout. He said the 
key to winning the election lies in 
convincing students to show up 
to the polls.

“We 
don’t 
have 
a 
voter 

registration 
problem 
at 
the 

University of Michigan,” he said. 
“The problem we have is a voter 
turnout problem.”

Gilchrist urged students to 

vote and encouraged them to get 
others to vote as well, claiming 
14 percent of students at the 
University voting in 2016 was 
“not acceptable.”

The University recently joined 

the Big 10 Voter Challenge in 
hopes of increasing voter turnout. 
The 
challenge 
tracks 
voter 

registration through TurboVote 
and will present the universities 
with the best registration rates 
and improvement compared to 
2014 election rates with awards.

Dingell, 
who 
represents 

Michigan’s 12th congressional 
district, which includes Ann 
Arbor, introduced Whitmer at 
the beginning of the event and 
criticized the term “blue wave,” 
saying it assumed that Democrats 
would win in November without 
doing the necessary work in the 
lead up to the election.

“First of all, I hate that word, 

the ‘blue wave,’” Dingell said, 
gesturing to the phrase written 
on a blackboard behind her. 
“Now I like ‘Go Blue,’ and we’re 
going to go blue in November.”

Whitmer echoed Dingell’s 

comment later on.

“We have all the makings 

of a huge change election 
here, but like Congresswoman 
Dingell said, I don’t for one 
second want anyone to get 
caught up in the fact that they 
think there’s going to be a wave 
and it’s just about riding it in,” 
Whitmer said. “You are the 
wave.”

hile sitting in the hair 
salon 
attempting 
a 
“new look” for the 
new school year, one of the stylists 
mentioned a nasty Facebook post 
about illegal immigrants. I froze, 
waiting to see which side of the 
debate my chatty new friends would 
fall on. “Ridiculous!” she yelled. 
“Time to unfriend this one.” I let out 
a small breath and allowed myself 
a grin. My hairdresser explained 
that they never talk about politics 
in the salon, but I laughed and told 
her it was refreshing. We began 
discussing the matter at hand, but 
soon the conversation morphed into 
other hot topics, from immigration 
to religion to freedom of the press 
to Trump’s politics. Despite the 
generation gap and perspective on 
religion, we agreed on many topics 
plaguing the current news. But, the 
most interesting part was how we 
both viewed controversy.
I have always enjoyed open 
conversations about politics. I’ll 
never claim to be conservative, but 
I can at least try to understand their 
point of view. Even if I don’t agree 
with the person I am talking to, I 
try to understand and hopefully 
respect their views. However, often 
times we see people who get into 
debates become more polarized in 
their opinions by the time they are 
done. Instead of listening to each 
other and trying to find common 
ground, they dig in their heels at the 
slightest opposition — halting the 
opportunity to grow.
But this conversation went 
differently. 
My 
hairdresser 
considered herself a moderate 
liberal, but she told me how 
important she thinks it is to talk to 
people who don’t have the same 
opinions. She encourages her 
mother, a staunch liberal, to do 
the same. In a country that doesn’t 
take well to controversy, she is a 
rare breed.
Some of our wisest and most 
beloved 
presidents 
have 
been 
the ones to speak out against 
this polarization. When George 
Washington left office, he begged 
America not to develop political 
parties. Abraham Lincoln told us a 

house divided cannot stand. So why 
do we continually let our increasing 
polarization tear our country apart?
According to a study done by 
Pew Research Center, America is 
becoming more and more polarized 
by the year. While 20 years ago, your 
views on racism had no relevance 
to your views on the environment, 
in today’s society, it is becoming 
increasingly more likely that, if you 
hold liberal or conservative views on 
certain topics, it translates to other 
topics as well, despite not having 
anything to do with each other.

In the Pew Research Center 
survey in 1994, only 3 percent of the 
American population fell into the 
consistently liberal category and 7 
percent identified as consistently 
conservative. However, in 2014, 
12 percent of Americans were 
consistently liberal and 9 percent 
were 
consistently 
conservative. 
Even 
people 
who 
previously 
considered themselves moderate 
are moving further to the right and 
left, with less little middle ground.
This in itself is not necessarily a 
bad thing. However, this streamline 
of ideals has been slowly leading 
to more and more polarization 
within parties, to the point where 
one side cannot acknowledge the 
other side’s good ideas simply 
because they don’t come from their 
own party. America is getting to 
the point where people don’t just 
disagree with the “other side,” but 
they consider them bad people, and 
occasionally a threat to the nation.
Pew Research Center found 

that the percentage of Republicans 
who had a very unfavorable 
opinion of Democrats rose 26 
percent between 1994 and 2014, 
and the percentage of Democrats 
who 
had 
very 
unfavorable 
opinions of Republicans rose 
22 percent. With this dramatic 
increase in animosity, it’s no wonder 
Congress shuts down so often. It’s 
hard enough to come to a consensus 
on an issue no one agrees on. It’s 
even harder when everyone actively 
dislikes each other.
There are many factors involved 
in the rise of polarization in politics. 
David Blankenhorn, in his article in 
The American Interest, highlights 
the impact of growing diversity, 
geographic and political sorting 
and new political rules as some of 
the ultimate causes of polarization 
— some of which cannot and should 
not be helped. However, some of 
the more direct causes are ones for 
which we ourselves are responsible: 
the either/or mindset, thinking 
uncertainty is a weakness and 
looking for evidence that supports 
a conclusion and ignoring facts, to 
name a few. With simple answers 
such as these, they should be simple 
fixes. However, this polarization 
runs deeper and is more prevalent 
than we think.
The first and most important 
step 
for 
depolarization 
is 
conversation. 
Not 
debate, 
not 
arguing — conversation. If we 
can stop looking at each other 
as Democrats and Republicans, 
liberals and conservatives, and 
start seeing each other as people 
with different ideas, we might 
start listening to each other. The 
second step is to change our general 
views on controversy. If we start 
viewing it as challenging and 
enlightening instead of frustrating 
and polarizing, we can begin to 
grow as individuals and as a society. 
When we can start having civil, 
controversial conversations with 
our hairdressers, then maybe we’ll 
finally understand each other.

A call to action on substance use
A

ccording 
to 
a 
story 
published in The Michigan 
Daily last spring, 25 percent 
of students at the University use 
Adderall 
and 
related 
drugs, 
despite only 9 percent of them 
having a prescription.
Substance 
use 
disorder, 
an 
umbrella term for the harmful 
use of psychoactive substances, is 
increasingly being recognized as a 
chronic brain disease. Therefore, 
I use the term “substance use” as 
opposed to “substance abuse” or 
“addiction” because I do not want to 
pass judgment on anyone’s behaviors 
nor do I want to use words with 
the weight of stigma attached. 
Substance use rewires the brain’s 
natural reward response, causing 
the cravings so often associated with 
these conditions. Despite this new 
framework, 
Alcoholics/Narcotics 
Anonymous persists in promoting 
the old dogma — that substance use 
is a moral failing.
But, is the use of psychoactive 
substances 
at 
the 
University 
of Michigan a problem worth 
addressing? I think so. The Daily’s 
survey 
on 
Adderall 
brought 
the misuse and trafficking of 
prescription 
drugs 
on 
campus 
into the limelight for many people. 
Putting aside the legal implications of 
the Adderall trade on campus — it is 
a federal crime to divert a controlled 
substance to people without a 
prescription — there are also serious 
health risks associated with these 
behaviors. Stimulants like Adderall 
(as well as illicit ones like cocaine and 
methamphetamine) can be deadly 
to students with heart conditions, 
and conditions that they might not 
even know they have until it is too 
late. Adderall, despite student beliefs, 
is highly addictive and can cause 
psychosis that can lead to suicide, 
as in the tragic case of a Vanderbilt 
University student in 2010.
Writing this column to my own 
standards of evidence is proving 
difficult because, well, we do not have 
good data on substance use at the 
University. Most of my evidence is, 
admittedly, anecdotal. I have heard 
from several sources that cocaine is 
a frequent feature of Greek life and 
co-op parties, as is the mixing of 
prescription drugs Adderall and 

Xanax with alcohol — a potentially 
lethal combination.
Yes, 
there 
was 
the 
aforementioned 
Adderall 
survey 
and several others focused on 
marijuana and alcohol. However, 
what about other substances like 
opioids — you know, the drugs that 
killed more Americans in one year 
than the Vietnam War or the HIV/
AIDS epidemic during its peak? 
A large, eight-year cohort study 
out of the University of Maryland 
found that prescription analgesics 
— which includes opioids — are the 
third most misused drug by college 
students, following marijuana and 
prescription 
stimulants 
(alcohol 
and tobacco were not considered 
in this study). According to that 
study, 35 percent of college students 
have used prescription stimulants 
non-medically at least once. The 
stereotype of an opioid user is 
someone of the working class in 
downtrodden areas in states like 
Michigan and Ohio. However, it 
only takes a prescription for Norco 
or Oxycontin after a sports injury or 
surgery for something to go wrong. 
Anyone, including high-achieving 
University students, is at risk for 
opioid addiction.

Some university communities, 
such as the University of Texas at 
Austin, have acted on opioid use on 
their campus. A student group at 
the university has been educating 
students and faculty there and at 
two other Texas universities on how 
to administer Narcan, the opioid 
overdose reversal drug. To my 
knowledge, nothing like this exists at 
the University of Michigan.
While interning within the 

realm 
of 
addiction 
treatment, 
I learned a lot about treatment 
options for substance use disorder. 
There 
are 
effective 
therapies, 
either psychological or medical, to 
help people break an addiction to 
psychoactive 
substances. 
While 
the University does a good job of 
educating students on the risk of 
the three most abused substances 
among our age group — tobacco, 
alcohol and marijuana — not much 
else is being done.
If you take a look at the “Alcohol 
and Other Drugs” page of the 
University Health Service website, 
you can see their many educational 
programs. This is all well and good, 
however, educational programs only 
help prevent people from getting 
addicted in the first place. There are 
many tools and programs for alcohol 
listed on that page, such as the “Stay 
in the Blue” app and the “Alcohol 
e-CHECKUP TO GO.” None of these 
programs help students break an 
addiction to alcohol. Is the University 
even offering treatment for alcohol 
use disorder, such as cognitive 
behavioral therapy and the anti-
cravings drug naltrexone to students 
through CAPS and UHS? If so, they 
need to do a better job of advertising 
these services. I would like to see a new 
UHS page or a new website made by 
the University dedicated to presenting 
comprehensive 
information 
on 
substance use, including screening 
and treatment options.
I 
urge 
the 
University 
administration to take a serious look 
at substance use on campus. We need 
a comprehensive survey looking at 
all psychoactive substances to have 
good data to act on. Furthermore, 
we need dedicated divisions of UHS 
and CAPS focused on addiction 
treatment that offers evidence-
based counseling and medication-
assisted treatment for students. The 
University community should look 
to the University of Texas at Austin 
as an example of how to proactively 
address student substance use. We 
cannot be reactive and wait until one 
of our students dies from an overdose 
because that would be a completely 
avoidable tragedy.

Hair-raising controversy

DANA PIERANGELI | COLUMN

Love me in pieces

ALEX KUBIE | COLUMN

I 

always pondered the idea 
of love and what it looked 
like: How would I know if I 
truly felt it? Would I ever find it in 
the first place? And, if so, what did 
that love even look like? Yet, at 15 
years old, the questions I had found 
myself 
mulling 
over 
almost 
every night quickly took a turn 
in a new direction.
Instead 
of 
the 
innocuous 
ruminating on the prospect of what 
love would hold, I deliberated: Can 
love be selective? Is it love when 
we choose to only accept a part of 
someone while disregarding the 
whole? Or is love unconditional 
— bound by no stipulation or 
circumstance? 
This 
newfound 
suspicion of love erupted from 
something I had never second-
guessed before. It wasn’t from the 
progression of a relationship or 
even the fawning over a crush. In 
fact, it wasn’t romantic at all. It 
came from a form of love that is 
inherent, marked upon us before 
the day we are even born — or so 
I thought.
In the face of my own 
uncertainty — coupled with a 
phone left open and my inability 
to lie with any conviction — I had 
“come out” to my parents. Erasing 
the narrative they had written 
for me, I had transformed from 
their sensitive yet “normal” boy to 
their vulnerable, gay son. While 
it took some time for my parents 
to adjust to this new “reality,” 
they eventually came to one 
simple conclusion: I was their 
son. And that meant a love that 
was unconditional.
However, this understanding 
of what being family means was 
not a universally-held belief. For 
some, in fact, it didn’t mean this 
at all. Aunts. Cousins. People I 
had spent weekends and holidays 
with. People that shared my blood. 
They couldn’t — or didn’t want to 
— accept me for all of who I was. 
I heard varying explanations, 
some stinging more than the 
others. “A sickness.” “It was for 
attention.” “An immoral choice.” 
But, there was one phrase in 
particular uttered by everyone that 
had accompanied each of these 
diagnoses — words that stung the 
most. “But we still love him.”
So, there I found myself, 
my face warm with frustration, 
offsetting the cold chill that 
lingered in the winter air, asking 
myself a question I didn’t want to 
know the answer to: Can someone 
only love a part of you? “Maybe,” 
I 
told 
myself 
half-heartedly. 
Love came in all different forms, 

after all, and maybe this was just 
another version of that seemingly 
undefinable four-letter word.
That biting winter drew to 
a close, and the coming spring 
months began to thaw its lingering 
chill. Each day, I began to warm 
to the idea of this new aspect of 
my identity and what embracing 
it could entail. Eventually, that 
waiting worked. More and more, 
I became comfortable with who 
I was. No longer did I view my 
future as something devastated 
— fractured by the reality of my 
sexuality. Rather, I simply viewed 
it with a new lens: a life filled 
with possibilities different than 
previously conceived, but still 
possibilities nonetheless
Then, I met Eric. We went 
out for ice cream. I treated him 
to a meal at our local diner. He 
surprised me with tickets to a 
movie (one that I had already seen, 
but I kept that part to myself). It 
didn’t matter. We were dating, and 
that was something I had imagined 
could only come to fruition within 
the private quarters of my mind. 
Our relationship grew quickly 
— faster than I had anticipated. 
With each passing day, I opened 
up about things tucked away so 
deeply that I had almost forgotten 
they still remained: the confusion, 
the shame, the acceptance. Our 
mangled skin shed with each 
breath of understanding. With it 
came a new shell built from shared 
experience and new questions 
that extended beyond the visceral: 
“Who can we share this with?” 
“When can we tell our friends?” 
And 
most 
importantly: 
“Can 
we introduce each other to our 
families?”
My mind began to race. “I 
know there are holidays coming 
up, and this way we could share 
them together,” he remarked. 
I 
thought 
about 
what 
my 
relationship meant — how I could 
show them the person who had 
such a profound impact on my path 
toward self-acceptance. I could 
finally bridge the gap between 
these two significant pieces of my 
life. However, the grin marked on 
my face began to sink as the reality 
that I had dug away began to break 
the surface.
“I would love to, but we can’t,” 
I conceded. The gaping divide 
between my two worlds began to 
grow even further. The prospect 
of bringing someone home to my 
family had been discussed before 
with great enthusiasm. It had been 
met with an excitement that knew 
no reservations. “How could we 

not want to meet the person who 
makes you happy?” I knew those 
words, however, came with a 
condition. Yet, the assurance that 
I was loved began to reverberate in 
my mind. Maybe, I thought, those 
words still rung true.
A solemn discussion with my 
parents quickly dispelled this 
fleeting hope. They had affirmed 
that I would always have a place 
to go see my family, but that Eric, 
regrettably, would probably not 
receive the same warm welcome 
from our relatives. I understood 
their convictions — the way they 
were raised, what they were taught. 
But the affirmation of their love for 
me could not escape my mind. I 
experienced what love had brought 
— the way it shaped my own father 
and his own perspective. It was 
that understanding that left a 
part of me in despair. I grappled 
with how my family could turn 
away someone whose words of 
clarity and acceptance had become 
ingrained as a part of my being.
That 
night, 
the 
air 
felt 
especially cold. With the lights 
off, I nestled into bed as my mind 
began to drift to questions I did not 
want to face. The darkness of the 
room was interrupted by a single 
light. I glanced over to see my 
phone displaying a new message. 
“They still love you,” it read. It was 
from my father.
Maybe he was right. Maybe 
there was a love there. But that 
love was for someone who did not 
exist. I could not leave Eric — and 
all that he had meant to me — at the 
door. It went beyond the refusal to 
acknowledge him. Eric was a part 
of my life that I had grappled with 
for so long. Those nights of hurting 
had forged the understanding that 
I had to accept every part of me 
to reach the love in myself that I 
needed to go on each day. To claim 
a love in only one of these parts 
was like ignoring a deep red stain 
of wine on your favorite shirt. No 
matter how many times you wash 
it to a shade that is light enough 
for you to ignore, it is still there. 
While my family tried to focus on 
anything but the stain that they 
could not erase, I chose to simply 
embrace the new colors.
A greater clarity set in my mind. 
Finally, I let the question in that I 
had tried so exhaustively to ignore. 
Can someone only love a part 
of you? In that now-illuminated 
room, I had my answer.

Riddled with issues, ‘The 
Nun’ proves enjoyable

FILM REVIEW

By just about any measure, “The 

Nun” is a subpar movie, at best. 
What plot it has is inconsistent, 
and its characters are little more 
than a name, a face and a generic 
backstory, yet after a summer that 
began with “Blumhouse’s Truth 
or Dare” and ended with “Slender 
Man,” there’s a playfulness to the 

horror that’s easy to appreciate. 
Towards the end of the first 
act, during a lengthy sequence 
revolving around a Black Plague-
era cemetery, I wrote in my 
notebook, “I don’t know who any 
of these people are, what they’re 
doing or why I’m supposed to 
care.” At the end of that same 
sequence, I wrote simply, “Well, 
that was fun.”

That’s the duality of “The Nun” 

in a snapshot. It has undeniable 
problems — more on that in a 
moment — but it’s fun in a way 
those aforementioned movies nix 
for po-faced tedium. If nothing 
else, it proves that a little bit of 
personality goes a long way — 
though I’ll add that this is the 
second release of the year, after 
“Winchester,” in which a character 
shoots a ghost. I didn’t care for it 
then, and I don’t care for it now.

In another welcome change 

from the norm, director Corin 
Hardy (“The Hallow”) makes an 
admirable attempt in the first half 
to focus more on building tension 
and dread than on assaulting 
his viewers with sudden blasts 
of sound. It isn’t devoid of jump 
scares, but in what may be the 
greatest twist of 2018, they’re 
occasionally sacrificed in favor of 
dramatic irony — we see the Nun 
looming in the background, but 
the characters remain blissfully 
unaware, resulting in a much 
scarier scene. Of course, I may be 
biased; after I saw “The Conjuring 
2,” the Nun stuck with me, and I 
lost a good deal of sleep.

However, it doesn’t take long 

to notice that despite Hardy’s 
competent 
direction 
and 

despite those fun touches, Gary 
Dauberman’s (“It”) script doesn’t 
do much else than ferry us from 
one scare to another. Nowhere 
is this more apparent than in the 
final act, which succumbs to its 
lack of strong foundation and 
becomes an out-of-nowhere “Da 
Vinci Code”-style treasure hunt 
that’s completely at odds with the 
haunted castle horror flick that led 
up to it.

The movie’s greatest weakness 

is its writing — beyond just the 
general feeling of plotlessness. 
Several characters are laden with 
exposition-filled 
monologues 

that aren’t unfamiliar ground 
for this series but are more 
perfunctory here than they have 
been elsewhere. Unlike similar 
scenes in “The Conjuring,” it’s 
simple information vomit instead 
of answers to questions. There’s 
no catharsis to gaining this 
knowledge because the story is 
so muddled that we’re not sure 
what questions we’re supposed 

to ask. It’s like the endless march 
of “Lost” rip-offs from the late 
2000s and early 2010s; the premise 
is 
hypothetically 
interesting, 

but it’s playing its cards so close 
to the chest in service of some 
Big Mystery that it’s hard to get 
invested.

More importantly, for all the 

fun it is in the moment, the movie 
misses out on what attracted 
people to the Nun and the 
“Conjuring” universe as a whole in 

the first place. In “The Conjuring 
2,” the Nun was a surprisingly 
character-based scare, a profaned 
image of what should have been a 
holy figure that was meant as an 
attack on Lorraine Warren’s faith. 
It’s a simple idea — a villain tries to 
turn a hero’s strengths against her 
— but it’s that sort of good-versus-
evil simplicity that’s central to the 
series’ appeal. “The Nun” follows 
in the footsteps of “Annabelle” 
and even the otherwise engaging 
“Annabelle: Creation” and forsakes 
that accessibility in favor of lore 
dumps and horror tropes that 
never work as well.

‘Save Me’ is a masterclass 
in subtle understatement

TV REVIEW

“Save Me,” a six-episode 

series making its U.S. debut 
on Starz this fall, is a British 
crime drama only in the 

sense that it’s both British 
and a crime drama. Anything 
else that phrase might evoke 
isn’t found here. There are 
no 
sleepy 
towns 
rocked 

by 
scandal 
or 
collectively 

grieving; 
In 
“Save 
Me,” 

South London hums along 
unperturbed by the horrible 
crime. There are no rough-
hewn, mismatched detectives 
deconstructing 
leads 
in 

dimly-lit rooms, with one 
exception: when the motion-
sensing lights at the police 
station turn themselves off. 

And the story isn’t a languid 
slow-burn that unfolds drop 
by drop, but one that moves at 
an absorbing, steady clip. In 
short, it’s the rare show that’s 
dark, but doesn’t feel the need 
to constantly remind you of it.

Like 
many 
of 
those 

atmospheric British dramas 
(think 
“Broadchurch” 
or 

“Doctor Foster”), the mystery 
of “Save Me” surrounds a 
missing 
child. 
Thirteen-

year-old 
Jody 
(Indeyarna 

Donaldson-Holness, 
“Absolutely 
Fabulous: 
The 

Movie”), has left her pristine 
suburban home in Surbiton to 
visit her estranged biological 
father Nelly (Lennie James, 
“The Walking Dead”) for a 
week. In a video message 
Jody leaves for her mother 
(Suranne 
Jones, 
“Doctor 

Foster”), she explains that she 
and her father have been in 
correspondence for a while, 
and that he has expressed 
interest in seeing her. The 
problem? Nelly hasn’t seen, 
spoken with or thought about 
Jody in 10 years.

So when Nelly is arrested on 

suspicion of Jody’s abduction, 
he’s initially confused, and 

then horrified. Someone has 
been chatting online with 
Jody, pretending to be Nelly. 
And as he reviews the chat 
logs, which are peppered with 
accurate details about his life 
and family, it dawns on him 
that the kidnapper must be 
someone he knows. To clear

his name, Nelly sets out to 
track down Jody himself.

Nelly, 
unlike 
a 
certain 

famous onscreen father, has 
no very particular set of 
skills with which to rescue 
his daughter. He’s a down-
on-his-luck womanizer with 
little going for him besides 
his sheer charm, spending 
his days at a local pub and 
his 
nights 
on 
whichever 

girlfriend’s couch is available. 
Lennie James is a treat to 
watch in the role, equal parts 
swagger and desperation. He 
is matched by the brilliant 
Suranne 
Jones, 
whose 

performance as Jody’s mother 
Claire is muted but rich and 
stirring. In one especially 
wrenching scene, a choked-
up Claire watches the police 
film a Jody lookalike walking 

through London, re-enacting 
the CCTV footage of the 

hours before the abduction 
in the hopes it will trigger a 

witness’s memory.

Along the way, as it begins 

to feel more and more grim, 
the show is granted some 
levity through small, lovely 
moments of London color. A 
woman in a burqa walks down 
the street carrying a flame-
painted skateboard. A man in 
Nelly’s neighborhood doesn’t 
let the deafening sound of 
police sirens interrupt his 
morning tai chi. “Save Me” 
is also brightened by Dustin 
O’Halloran’s (“Transparent”) 
gorgeous score, which opts 
for delicate strings in favor 
of anything too bombastic 
or obvious. And that’s the 
real beauty of this show — its 
ability to steer itself clear of 
sensationalism 
and 
horror, 

and instead tell a story so 
quietly devastating. 

The story 

isn’t a languid 

slow-burn that 

unfolds drop by

that moves at

The unexpected key to 
health and wellness is 
in Judge Judy’s hands

HEALTH AND WELLNESS COLUMN

I think I was in eighth grade 

when I made perhaps my 
greatest clothing acquisition: 
an NPR “Get Smarter” t-shirt. 
Never mind that, at that time 
of my life, “Morning Edition” 
meant a big bowl of Reese’s 
Puffs, and the word “podcast” 
connoted some form of nap. It 
would be years before I was 
blessed with my first Terry 
Gross interview. But I looked 
past the qualifications. I liked 
the implication behind the 
shirt; it was a statement. It 
suggested that maybe, just 
maybe, my cool, progressive 
parents 
had 
surrounded 

me with formative cultural 
intellectualism, an exposure 
to a level of enlightenment 
my peers wouldn’t begin to 
sniff until at least 2014. It was 
conceit in its purest form. Be 
still, my subservient plebeian 
fourth 
period 
lunch 
table-

sharers. I did it all in the name 
of the smarts, existent or not.

Those brain cells? The key 

to feeling good. And that’s the 
point of this column. They’ll 
feel replenished, rejuvenated 
even, by someone transcendent. 
Bold. Fair. If you haven’t 
guessed by now, I’m talking 
about judicial royalty. The 
original enforcer. When we 
look for fairness, we find that 
it lies in due process. In due 
process lies life improvement. 
And here, we arrive at Judge 
Judy.

You might be wondering 

what separates the judge from 
the rest of daytime television. 
Well, Maury is exploitative 
and tasteless. Jerry is not nice. 
They’re unkosher entertainers 
who live to stir the pot each 
Tuesday afternoon. On the 
other end of things, Oprah 
is sanctified, and Ellen is an 
angel. In my mind none of 
these icons (good or bad) can 
challenge Judy’s unique place 
in TV.

Judy, 
in 
fact, 
shouldn’t 

need 
her 
credibility 

vindicated by anyone, but for 
those 
skeptical, 
here’s 
one 

endorsement: Jim Harbaugh. 
In March 2016, Michigan’s 

head football coach tweeted, 
“I urge President Obama to 
nominate 
to 
the 
Supreme 

Court the wise and competent, 
Judge Extraordinaire Judith 
Sheindlin.”

Harbaugh is an Xs and Os 

mastermind. 
A 
quarterback 

guru. Even after disappointing 
finishes in his past two years 
in Ann Arbor, he remains one 
of the most well-respected 
coaches in the sport. It says 
a lot then, that for a break 
— a meditative pause — this 
jackhammer of a human turns 
to Judge Judy. Why shouldn’t 
you do the same?

There’s 
something 
about 

her fiery mix of authority and 
subtle warmth that adds up to 
an intangible sort of feng shui 
for viewers. For 22 minutes 
each day, you know what you’re 
getting, and there’s legitimate 

therapeutic 
value 
in 
that. 

Sit back, relax and enjoy the 
show, because it might be the 
only semblance of normalcy in 
your life. I know that has been 
the case for me. At the very 
least, you get a meme. A not-
good meme. 2012-core. But a 
chuckle.

What exactly about Judge 

Judy makes us feel better? 
Consider how she handled 
this dog’s reunion with its 
owner. The judge is hands-off 
yet observant. Calculated and 
articulate. When she realizes 
the authenticity of the moment, 
she allows it to resonate in 
the room. As she orchestrates 
the scene, we, the (hooked) 
audience, better understand the 
bond between owner and dog. 
There’s nothing cheap about 
it. So maybe it’s her feel for 
things, her procedural digging 
into 
visceral 
emotion. 
She 

uncovers the truth, of course. 
It’s resettling, internally.

And it’s no bit. Not really, at 

least. I don’t quite know what 
self-care means and I can’t 
pretend to know how to nurture 
myself or, more importantly, 
improve 
the 
well-being 
of 

others. I do know, however, 
when I need to slow things 
down while everything else 
goes blurring by. Some of my 
most vulnerable moments have 
come in that overwhelming 
blur of everythingness, but 
all of my most triumphant 
resurgences have occurred at a 
point of extreme nothingness.

For me, that point is often on a 

grandparent’s couch in a part of 
the universe far, far away from 
real shit. The change of scenery 
is the machine, but Judy is the 
mindlessly wholesome engine 
that keeps the mental regroup 
going. It’s my cliché “stop, 
take a breath and reassess,” 
and it’s of an un-underminable 
importance. 
Sometimes 
you 

need background noise. Other 
times you need mind-bendingly 
cathartic 
entertainment 
to 

distract. Luckily, Judge Judy’s 
show can do both. Besides: If 
you’ve made it this far in this 
piece, you’re either my mom 
or someone undergoing a last-
ditch effort to improve your 
wellness. Why not give Judy a 
shot?

It goes without saying that 

the name “Paul McCartney” is 
the name of a legend. Over the 
last six decades, it has gathered 
enough mythic credibility to 

almost be synonymous with 
“legend” in itself. Diehard fans 
across the globe (of which there 
are no doubt millions) are plenty 
familiar with McCartney as he 
stands today, from the frequent 
musical collaborations to the 
sworn veganism to (perhaps 
most notoriously) the explosively 
impressive 
live 
performances 

and firework-spurred stadium 
tours.

But roped in with McCartney’s 

many current ventures is the fact 
that to most of the world, and 
even to many of those diehard 
fans, McCartney is a Beatle (or 
rather, a former Beatle) first and 
foremost. The classic McCartney 
sound — and he has so many 
sounds — is the sound of the ’60s 

and the ’70s. Distinguished bass 
and catchy guitar riffs, lyrics and 
melodies sometimes tender and 
wholesome, sometimes snarled 
or even screamed. Think “Maybe 
I’m Amazed,” “Live and Let Die” 
or “Blackbird.”

This is all what makes Egypt 

Station, McCartney’s new release 
through Capitol Records, such 
a thoroughly classic record at 
its core. It’s his most Beatle-y 
album in ages, permeated with 
unmistakable touches from his 
time in Wings and even The 
Fireman. For all the different 
meanings 
McCartney’s 
name 

has taken on, Egypt Station 
embodies almost all of them. 
When you think of McCartney, 
you might think of his screaming 
on the earliest Beatles tracks 
like the “Long Tall Sally” cover; 
you might think of the tender 
empathy of “Here Today” or 
“And I Love Her”; you might 
think of electric guitars, ambient 
Fireman-style electronica, piano 
cascades or acoustic familiarity. 
If you think of any one of these 
things, you are thinking of Egypt 
Station.

The album begins with the 

scenic “Opening Station,” which 
offers us a flash of the strange 
atmospherics 
with 
which 

McCartney experimented during 
his Fireman projects alongside 

Youth. He then gets heavy right 
away with “I Don’t Know,” 
a sweeping look inward that 
begins with a “Let It Be”-esque 
piano solo and rapidly evolves 
into a heartfelt ballad, repeatedly 
questioning, “What’s wrong with 
me?/ I don’t know, I don’t know.” 
Egypt Station is full of these 
introspective moments, which 
recur in “Confidante” and in 
“Happy With You,” a genuinely 
soft-hearted 
song 
faintly 

reminiscent of John Lennon’s 
“Watching the Wheels.”

Even in his more thoughtful 

songs, McCartney sacrifices none 
of his energy, nor the trademark 
creative edge that has brought so 
much variety into his catalogue. 
Yet it is on a few of the album’s 
jumpier songs that this side of 
him really gets a chance to shine. 
“Come On To Me,” released as 
a striking single back in Jun., 
is jaunty, fun, irresistible and 
above all else, unmistakably 
McCartney. It’s almost too easy to 
picture him in concert, slamming 
his guitar and singing wide-eyed 
into a microphone, cocking his 
head. “You know we can’t be seen 
exchanging 
information,” 
he 

sings, as suggestive and sly as he 
has been ever since his days as a 
Quarryman.

Thrumming 
electronica 

eclipses into a classic-feeling rock 

riff in “Who Cares,” with Macca 
showing off his impressive vocal 
range with several high-pitched 
whoops. When he shouts his 
way through the second chorus 
(“Who cares what the idiots say 

/ Who cares what the idiots do”), 
it’s so easy to hear the much 
younger man who once belted 
out hits like “Twist and Shout.” 
On “Fuh You,” he sings, “On the 
night that I met you, I was out 

on the town,” and it rings true; 
listening, you can’t help but think, 
“Sure, I bet Paul McCartney does 
have nights out on the town!” He 
also plays with our expectations 
in the chorus: “Want a love that’s 
so proud and real / You make me 
wanna go out and steal / I just 
want it fuh you.” His enunciation 
brings a different meaning to 
mind, though, and the wording 
is almost certainly McCartney’s 
way of lyrically “fuh”-ing with 
us.

Amid an album that takes us 

through worlds where love can 
be stolen, and where butterflies 
“stomp around the forest / 
chanting long lost anthems,” 
some quality songs — like the 
tender “Hand in Hand” and the 
obligatory-ish 
peace 
anthem 

“People Want Peace” — are left 
a little forgettable compared to 
the rest. The truly thoughtful 
political track is not “People 
Want Peace” but rather “Despite 
Repeated Warnings,” a song 
similar to “Band on the Run” in its 
creative and sprightly multiple-
act structure. Lines about a ship 
doomed under an incompetent 
captain feel decidedly allegorical. 
It is difficult to hear lines like 
“Those who shout the loudest / 
May not always be the smartest,” 
“How can we stop him? / Grab 
the keys and lock him up” and 

“The captain’s crazy, but he 
doesn’t let them know it / He’ll 
take us with him if we don’t do 
something soon to slow it,” and 
not think of Donald Trump, 
whom McCartney has repeatedly 
and vocally criticized.

Egypt Station is stunningly 

fresh, 
relentlessly 
energetic 

and simultaneously fun and 
thoughtful. It is noteworthy that 
we are getting an album like 
this not only from an artist well 
into his 70s, but from an artist 
who proves himself to the world 
anew every single decade, every 
year, every day. One would have 
thought McCartney had nothing 
left to prove as early as 1971, but 
his career since then has been 
anything but coasting, from his 
musical work (including regular 
album releases — both solo and 
with The Fireman — and his 
wildly popular live tours) to his 
activism. “Do It Now” offers 
us a window into the icon’s 
motivation, a song that looks 
toward a cloudy future with 
lines like “I’ll be leaving in the 
morning / Watch me go” and 
“I don’t know where the wind 
is blowing,” and entreats the 
listener to “Do it now / While 
the vision is clear / Do it now / 
While the feeling is here.” Paul 
McCartney is doing it now; he 
has been his whole life.

On the art of America’s 
most neglected wonders

COMMUNITY CUTURE NOTEBOOK

This 
summer, 
I 
literally 

stumbled 
upon 
a 
waterfall. 

Walking off the beaten path, my 
family’s only directions to this 
said wonder were delivered by 
word of mouth. The deeper we 
ventured 
into 
the 
deciduous 

woods — hot, sticky, perspiration 
running down our backs — the 
more desolate our surroundings 
became. A few stray hikers passed 
us in the opposite direction, 
which was enough to confirm 
that something lay beyond the 
immediate reaches of our sight. 
Yet there were no wooden signs 
to indicate anything spectacular 
around the corner, as if travelers 
were 
expected 
to 
discover 

the storybook-like wonder by 
accident.

The Great Falls in Cleveland 

Metro Park was our destination. 
A Google search revealed an 
abundance of spectacular images, 
but a Google Maps search revealed 
almost nothing. Finally, bordering 
on frustration, we met a traveler 
who took us as far as a cluster of 
bushes slightly off the trail.

“Follow this path down, and 

you’ll see it,” the man said, a hint 
of a smile tracing his features. The 
“path” he described was nothing 
more than a narrow, sharp 
downhill slope of chocolate-
brown mud, mostly disguised 
by criss-crossing sharp thorns. 
Staggering down the path, sinking 
our shoes into the soft earth and 
wincing at every prick, we saw 
it. Soaring above us, thundering 
sheets of water crashing down 
onto the rocks, the Great Falls 
roared.

Finding rare gems like these 

can be exhilarating, giving you 
a 
top-of-the-world-like 
high. 

But I believe it’s more humbling 
than anything. Mother Nature 
is reminiscent of an artist who 
feels no need to show off her 
brilliance. Some of her most 
beautiful waterfalls are concealed 
behind thickets of rainforest trees, 
inaccessible to man. Her canyons 
take days to cross and her tallest 
mountains 
are 
unreachable. 

The beauty in the world’s most 
magnificent 
rock 
formations, 

deserts and hot springs is that 
they would shine even if they were 
never seen by our eyes. There’s no 
need for public appreciation or 
popularity. If anyone is humble, 
it’s the earth.

As I sat among the rocks at the 

base of the Great Falls, reaching 
down and feeling the icy-cool 
water tickle my fingertips, I felt so 
small. Small, but comforted. I was 
a tiny, passing speck in the face of 
the world, but this world embraced 
me with open arms. It called to me 
to explore and to educate myself on 
my surroundings. Nature’s canvas 
is rocks and water, and her art is 
in the sandy pebbles bouncing 
along the stream and the purple 
wildflowers poking their heads 
out of the green shrubs along the 
bank. Famous Barcelona-based 
artist Antoni Gaudí never used 
any straight lines in his sculptures, 
drawing from nature’s brilliant 
asymmetry. The world around 
us isn’t symmetric, but instead 
slanted and sloping in all the right 
places.

The National Park System 

estimates that over 330 million 
people visited U.S. National Parks 
and 807 million visited America’s 
State Parks last year. The statistics 

are staggering, but I can’t help 
but wonder: How many of these 
visitors actually saw the parks? 
I don’t mean taking a weekend 
trip, snapping some pictures and 
leaving. Truly seeing the parks 
means sitting in a spot for hours 
and thinking of nothing but the 
art around you. Closing your eyes 
and realizing that the tunes of the 
blue jays combined with the shrill 
calls of the red-wing blackbirds 
sounds an awful lot like a duet, 
like a sweet harmony. Staring 
up through the highest canopy 
of trees to glimpse the brilliant, 
untainted blue sky. America’s 
parks have so much to offer, and 
my heart breaks a little every time 
I see a tourist stare at a waterfall 
for much less time than they take 
pictures of it.

The 
relationship 
between 

humans and technology becomes 
more complex with every passing 
day. Can’t nature be the one place 
where we put our phones away? 
America’s parks are receiving 
record high visitors, but are still 
neglected. 
Climb 
the 
Rocky 

Mountains and see the conifers 
rustle like paintbrush bristles in 
the breeze. Let the brilliant hues 
of Yellowstone’s hot springs sink 
into your being. Feel the ferocity 
of the Atlantic waves crashing 
onto the stony beaches of Maine. 
The introspection that comes 
with being immersed in nature is 
much more valuable than the site 
itself.

Ann Arbor is no exception. 

On the rare chance that you have 
free time during the school year, 
sit in the Arb. Or along Barton

Paige Jones has been the difference in the Wolverines’ successful season

Last year, matchups with 
Colorado State ended in two 
losses for Michigan — one of 
which was season-ending. This 
year, however, the Wolverines 
seemed to have flipped a new 
page.
Despite all the talk about 
about revenge and redemption 
against the Rams, the difference 
maker for Michigan was the 
one person that thought none 
of that — freshman Paige Jones 
just wanted to win.
Coming into the game, the 
outside hitter knew nothing of 
the small rivalry. Though, to be 
fair, she barely even knew that 
the Wolverines played Colorado 
State last year. But what she 
did know was how much her 
teammates wanted the game, 
and she delivered accordingly.
In a career night, Jones 
stunned the arena with a 
personal-best 18 kills on .500 
hitting percentage and seven 
service 
aces. 
Though 
her 
services have always come as 
a problem to opponents, they 
don’t come without drawbacks 
for Michigan. The jump topspin 
serve that she does is a high 
risk, high reward serve, but on 
Saturday night, Jones reaped 
all of the reward and little of 
the risk.
“(Jones) has been trying to 
find a rhythm 
with that,” said 
Michigan coach 
Mark 
Rosen. 
“It’s a high-risk 
serve, 
and 
if 
you don’t hit it 
just right, then 
it takes off on 
you. 
And 
you 
look kinda silly, 
like ‘Hey, I just 
missed that by a 
lot.’ But you just missed a little 
bit on your hand.
“... Her contact was really 
good, and I thought she got into 
a really good rhythm tonight, 

and that’s what she’s been 
working on. And she’s been 
working hard in practice and 
in matches where she can get 
that contact and control it and 
tonight she did 
a great job and 
Colorado 
State 
paid the price.”
For the most 
part, serving set 
the tone early in 
the match. The 
game plan for 
the Rams was 
to serve hard to 
get 
Michigan 
out of system. 
And they succeeded early on, 
as Michigan came out slow and 
was unable to properly corral 
the ball.
But 
Jones 
answered 

immediately, getting aggressive 
— despite being out of system — 
hammering the ball home to set 
the tone for Michigan to follow. 
The 
change 
in 
momentum 
allowed 
the 
Wolverines 
to 
fight out of their 
slump, 
with 
Jones 
leading 
the way with a 
then-game-high 
six kills.
The 
turning 
point 
in 
the 
first set came at 
13-10. The game 
had been back 
and forth, but Colorado State 
had seen the better end of a few 
closely contested rallies. But 
with a kill and a series of serves 
from Jones, Michigan went on a 

seven-point run that shifted the 
momentum firmly in its favor. 
With control of the pace, the 
Wolverines didn’t relinquish 
the lead the remainder of the 
set.
And if there 
was any better 
way to close out 
the set, the team 
wouldn’t 
have 
had it.
At 
23-21 
in 
the 
first 
set, 
Michigan 
fell 
into a scramble. 
The dig hadn’t 
come off clean 
and junior setter Mackenzi 
Welsh did a backwards jog to 
get to the ball. In an attempt to 
salvage the play, she did a two-
handed backwards bump to 

send the ball high into the air to 
Jones’ general vicinity.
As she had done all game, 
Jones bailed out the out-of-
system play.
And then she 
saw her turn to 
serve again.
If it was any 
testament to her 
serving 
skills, 
no other play or 
player managed 
to 
draw 
the 
attention of the 
arena the way 
Jones did as she 
approached the 
service line with the ball in 
her hands. Ushering a wave of 
silence and drawing everyone to 
their feet, she delivered a serve 
worthy of the attention. It was 

an ace, her sixth of the night.
And even though her serving 
was 
mitigated 
due 
to 
the 
adjustments in the second set, 
the Rams failed to shut her 
down. Despite a still productive 
set, her impact was forced to 
just four kills and three digs.
While that’s what it says on 
the stat sheet, the story on the 
court was entirely different. 
Jones attracted more attention 
from the defense that freed 
up senior outside hitter Carly 
Skjodt 
and 
redshirt 
junior 
middle blocker Cori Crocker, 
who Rosen stated were “at the 
top of every scouting report.”
“They were committed on 
(Jones) more,” Rosen said. “I 
mean, when someone gets six 
kills in the first set, they’re 
going to focus on her some more 
and I thought there were a lot 
of times when they formed a 
really good block and she found 
a way to bang around them and 
off of her.”
The third set was a return 
to form for Jones after a brief 
set out of the spotlight. Jones 
tallied eight kills in the third 
set alone. The next closest to 
her on the team was Skjodt with 
seven — for the entire game. 
And it wasn’t long into the 
third before she recovered her 
groove, scoring the first earned 
point for the Wolverines.
And in a more controlled 
set than the first two, with 
Michigan 
leading 
until 
the end, Jones — 
coming off of her 
serve — curled 
to 
the 
front 
of the net and 
ended the game 
on 
her 
terms, 
something 
she 
did the entire 
night.
But if you ask 
her, you won’t get the slightest 
bit of a boast or gloat. Because it 
wasn’t about her in her eyes. It 
was a team win, and to her, that 
was plenty.

Michigan beats WMU 
thanks to some heart

Sometimes, it takes a little bit 
more than sheer athletic prowess to 
take a match in the beautiful game.
While the Michigan men’s 
soccer 
team’s 
match 
against 
Western 
Michigan 
ended 
in 
overtime jubilation, the road there 
was not quite as rosy. At the 82nd 
minute, Michigan coach Chaka 
Daley brought the team together on 
the sideline after conceding a game-
tying empty-net goal to Western 
Michigan. 
Along 
with 
senior 
midfielders Robbie Mertz and Ivo 
Cerda, Daley reminded the team to 
calm down.
“We prepare for these moments 
and we always say things can go 
wrong and you prepare for those 
times,” said Cerda, who scored the 
game-winning header. “We make 
sure we’re engaging in positivity 
and encouraging each other. Doing 
all the right stuff.”
To that point, the Wolverines 
had not only squandered a 2-0 
lead, but many other opportunities 
to put the game away, as well — 
sophomore forwards Umar Farouk 
Osman and Mohammed Zakyi 
both repeatedly got deep into the 
belly of the Broncos’ defense in the 
first half, but neither could blow the 
game open.
Seventeen minutes in, Osman 
raced 
untouched 
70 
yards 
downfield, but laid his pass just in 
front of Zakyi. A few minutes later, 
Osman sent a high pass across the 

box. He watched for what seemed 
like an eternity as Zakyi waited 
and chopped the ball just right of 
the Broncos’ goalie. The duo almost 
connected again twice in the 59th 
and 60th minute, but yet again 
couldn’t finish.
“I thought we were a little bit 
too impatient,” Daley said. “We 
were trying to just run, run, run, 
run and we didn’t show enough 
patience in the buildup. When we 
just go and don’t connect we all 
have to run back 50, 60, 70 yards. 
We wanted to show some patience 
and composure.”
Western Michigan gave the 
Wolverines its best shot — both 
figuratively and literally. Rather 
than buckling to the pressure of 
being down 2-0, the Broncos were 
the more patient team in the second 
half, controlling the pace of the game 
and even throwing in some shoves 
and pushes to intimidate Michigan.
Historically, 
the 
Wolverines 
haven’t fared well against their 
in-state rivals from Kalamazoo. And 
it certainly wasn’t easy for Michigan 
to just pick it up after watching its 
lead evaporate and getting tossed 
around. But in doing so, Michigan 
established itself as a team with 
heart, unity and resilience.
“We have a mantra,” Cerda said. 
“We like to stick together. Robbie 
and I as captains make sure we 
actually practice that ... Doing all 
the right stuff. We don’t give up, 
and we’re confident if things go 
astray that we’ll be able to overcome 
them.”

Hernandez, offense inspire confidence for ‘M’

Michigan women’s soccer 
coach Jennifer Klein found 
herself in a pickle in the 
Wolverines’ final game of the 
spring. Thanks to a number of 
absences, the first-year coach 
was missing all of her top-
choice striker options.
She analyzed her options, 
and with no better alternative, 
settled 
on 
using 
then-
freshman 
midfielder 
Nicki 
Hernandez 
as 
her 
striker. 
Hernandez put up a strong 
performance, 
convincing 
Klein she had stumbled upon a 
new winning formula.
Seven games into 2018, the 
move looks like a stroke of 
genius, as Hernandez has six 
goals and four assists, leading 
the team in both categories.
“I 
think 
because 
we’re 
getting her higher and into the 
goal zone in and around the 
net, she’s able to able to put 
the ball in the net,” Klein said. 
“She has good skill and she’s 

not scared to shoot.”
Hernandez 
started 
12 
games last year but managed 
just a goal and an assist 
as 
sophomore 
midfielder 
Sarah Stratigakis and senior 
forward Reilly Martin made 
headlines for Michigan. Now, 
Hernandez 
has 
elevated 
herself to their level as the 
team’s most important player 
in non-conference play.
But 
while 
Hernandez 
has been the best player, 
Stratigakis and Martin have 
been critical to her success. 
The trio notched both the 
goal and assist on five of the 
Wolverines’ six goals in their 
6-1 win over Central Michigan 
on Friday night and regularly 
practice in tandem to build 
chemistry for game days.
Off the field, Hernandez and 
Stratigakis are best friends, 
helping to fortify their mutual 
understanding.
“Having a close relationship 
off the field really helps on the 
field,” said Hernandez. “It’s 
really important for us to know 

each other. We always look for 
each other and it’s good for us 
to connect with each other, 
especially in these upcoming 
games because that’s how 
we’re going to succeed.”
Coming off a three-game 
losing streak — in which 
Hernandez 
and 
Stratigakis 
scored Michigan’s only two 
 
goals — Klein knew she could 
trust her offensive stars to 
right the ship against Central 
Michigan.
That safety net is what gives 
Klein and the team confidence 
heading into Big Ten play.
“Coming in with our new 
staff,” Klein said, “we wanted 
to 
establish 
an 
attacking 
identity and really try to 
make sure we have options in 
numbers going forward.
“They’re really thriving in 
this system of play. I know 
Strat and Reilly both have 
been really impactful with 
their years before and I think 
we found a good spot for Nicki 
and we’ve freed her up and 
she’s been able to be creative 

and impactful.”
But while the locker room 
remained upbeat through the 
Wolverines’ 
losing 
streak, 
the team needed a strong 
performance Friday to regain 
its 
confidence. 
Thanks 
to 
Hernandez, 
Martin, 
and 
Stratigakis, that’s what it got.
“It 
totally 
(impacts 
our 
confidence) and that’s what 
we were looking for coming 
in,” said Klein.
That confidence is more 
than coach speak. It’s obvious 
in the way the team plays, 
pressuring opponents at every 
turn and always looking to 
get forward, in contrast to a 
defensive mindset preached 
under coach Greg Ryan last 
season.
But more than that, it’s 
obvious in the players.
“In the Big Ten, if we go 
down,” 
Hernandez 
says, 
before pausing and cracking a 
laugh, “which we won’t.”
In her current form, that 
prediction might not be too far 
off.

Kemp adjusting to new defensive tackle spot

Carlo Kemp started the first 
game of his career Saturday 
at defensive tackle. With both 
sophomore nose guard Aubrey 
Solomon and fifth-year senior 
defensive 
tackle 
Lawrence 
Marshall out due to injuries, 
it was a moment three years 
in the making for the redshirt 
sophomore.
“It was my first time playing 
and having a majority of snaps 
during a football game, so it 
just felt really good to be out 
there and run around and just 
play football,” Kemp said. “It’s 
been a while since I got a lot of 
snaps.”
That’s partly because Kemp 
has twice changed positions 
with the Michigan football 
team. When he first came to 
Ann Arbor in the spring of 2016, 
Kemp cut ten pounds to practice 
at outside linebacker. But he 
didn’t feel comfortable there, 
and 
after 
receiving 
limited 
action his freshman year, Kemp 
switched back to defensive end.
Drawing 
from 
familiarity 
playing the position in high 
school, it was a more natural fit 
for him. That still didn’t equate 
to playing time. Firmly behind 
now-junior Rashan Gary at 
Michigan’s anchor spot, Kemp 
registered just three tackles 
and one quarterback pressure 
in 2017.
So early this past winter, he 
went to defensive line coach 
Greg Mattison with a proposal: 
move to the three-technique 
defensive tackle. Kemp didn’t 
have interior line experience, 
and he knew the change meant 
embarking on an ultra-intense 
workout and eating regimen to 
gain weight. It was a challenge 
Kemp was ultimately willing to 
undertake.
“Even if it meant being a 
backup, 
just 
letting 
coach 
Mattison know, ‘Hey, I want 

to learn it at least’ just so he 
has that option,” Kemp said. “I 
think he liked the idea of me 
coming to him and asking him.”
Thus Kemp began working 
at both defensive tackle and 
anchor during spring practices, 
picking up on sometimes subtle 
differences in footwork and 
blocking. Kemp now feels like 
he’s honing in 
his 
technique, 
but it wasn’t an 
easy process.
“For 
me, 
it was pretty 
tough 
just 
because 
I 
hadn’t done it 
and it’s a whole 
lot 
faster,” 
Kemp 
said. 
“At the anchor 
position, you just got to watch 
that tight end and whatever he 
does you just kinda play off it. 
If you try to mirror anyone’s 
footwork inside, you’re gonna 
end up 10 yards running into 
your linebackers messing up the 
whole defensive play.
“On the inside, you got to play 

even more aggressive since you 
got the guard and the tackle to 
worry about, and you’re getting 
600 pounds on you on every 
play.”
More on the mental side, that 
number 
represented 
Kemp’s 
biggest 
hurdle 
to 
changing 
positions. 
He’d 
already 
cut 
10 pounds to play outside 
linebacker. Now, 
Kemp would have 
to beef up to hold 
his own at three-
tech.
And 
with 
plenty of targeted 
eating 
and 
protein 
shakes, 
Kemp 
did 
just 
that. 
He 
went 
from around 275 
to 295 pounds, 
becoming one of the team’s most 
physically imposing players in 
the process. 
“Just 
really 
strong, 
he’s 
playing 
really 
strong,” 
said 
coach Jim Harbaugh. “Very 
dedicated player who we had no 
hesitation starting and playing 
him a lot. He’s coming into his 

own. Physically, the strength is 
showing up.”
It showed when Michigan 
needed it on Saturday. Kemp, 
who rotated with junior Michael 
Dwumfour and fifth-year senior 
Bryan Mone, made two tackles 
and was instrumental on junior 
defensive end Rashan Gary’s 
first sack of the season. Bull 
rushing the left guard in the 
first quarter, Kemp closed off 
both inside gaps, allowing Gary 
to come off the edge and tackle 
Western Michigan quarterback 
Jon Wassink for a loss.
Kemp is far from a finished 
product at defensive tackle, and 
the Wolverines would benefit 
significantly from the returns 
of Solomon and Marshall, who 
are “week to week” according 
to Harbaugh. But so far, Kemp’s 
long transition has worked out 
for both him and Michigan. 
“You just want to get on the 
field,” Kemp said. “So if they 
recommend moving inside, I’m 
not gonna fight that. I’m going 
to be the best at the three-tech 
that I can and just fight my way 
on the field.”

while since 
I got a lot of 
snaps.”

The redshirt sophomore got his first start of his college career in Saturday’s win
Wolverines get shots 
but struggle to score

For two straight games, 
Emma Way came through in 
the clutch for the Michigan 
field hockey team. On both 
Friday and Sunday, the senior 
forward scored game-winning 
goals in overtime, and she even 
managed to score with 8:17 
remaining in the extra period 
in both games.
But Way’s flashy game-
winners hid the fact that the 
Wolverines 
(3-3) 
shouldn’t 
have been in overtime in the 
first place. They tallied 17 
shots against Pacific on Friday 
and 24 against Monmouth on 
Sunday, despite emerging with 
just four goals across the two 
games. With that many shots, 
Michigan expected to score 
more goals.
“Obviously 
it’s 
really 
frustrating,” Way said. “When 
you see the stats saying we 
have a lot of shots and no goals, 
you know you have to work on 
something.”
For the Wolverines, that 
something could be finishing 
scoring chances off penalty 
corners. Michigan scored off 
of just one penalty corner this 
weekend — scoring on only one 
of its 13 chances Sunday and 
none of its 12 chances Friday.
The lone penalty corner the 
Wolverines managed to score 
from was Way’s second game-
winner, where there were just 
six Hawks on the field — just 
seven players on each side 
take the field for overtime 
and Pacific received a green 
card moments earlier — and 
the extra space on the field 
may have contributed to the 
scoring success.
“I think we felt good, having 
a little bit more room on the 
field 
now,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach Marcia Pankratz. “We 

were able to execute. I think 
we felt confident about that.”
Despite 
the 
last-minute 
scoring, the shots throughout 
each game were frequently 
saved, blocked, or just wide of 
the goal. 
When 
a 
shot 
misses, 
sometimes it’s doomed from 
the start. Maybe it was sent at 
a bad angle or directly towards 
the goalie, or it just wasn’t 
strong enough to get through 
the defenders. But sometimes, 
it’s a case of bad luck.
“It’s a game of wins and 
losses, sometimes you get it 
and sometimes you don’t,” said 
sophomore midfielder Kayla 
Reed. “Sometimes it’s just the 
luck of the bounce. I’m really 
confident in the girls, I know 
they’re all great goal scorers, 
but 
now 
it’s 
just 
getting 
that into play. It’s definitely 
something we’re going to work 
on as a team.”
The Wolverines had four 
shots that bounced off the side 
or the crossbar of the goal in 
Sunday’s game, including a 
shot that hit off the side of the 
goal after a penalty corner. 
While Michigan can certainly 
improve its finishing, some of 
this 
weekend’s 
inefficiency 
may come down to unlucky 
bounces.
“We 
got 
24 
shots 
to 
(Monmouth’s) six, so we’re 
getting there, we’re making 
the opportunities,” Reed said. 
“Over time, we’ll start slotting 
them in, and when we do, 
hopefully that scoreboard will 
read a little bit more difference 
between the two teams.”
Misfortune likely played 
a part in the Wolverines’ 
scoring difficulty. But when 
they score just four goals on 
41 shots in a weekend, it may 
take more than just improved 
luck for them to increase their 
output.

Through criticism, Michigan looks at silver lining with offensive line

When asked to evaluate his 
offensive line’s play thus far, Jim 
Harbaugh predictably offered 
a rosier picture than what one 
would have found on an online 
message board. 
But Harbaugh didn’t even 
mention the five guys who have 
played seven of the season’s first 
eight quarters.
“It 
was 
good 
to 
see 
(freshman) Jalen Mayfield get 
in the game, it was good to see 
(redshirt 
sophomore) 
James 
Hudson get in the game and do 
well,” Harbaugh said during 
Monday’s 
press 
conference. 
“We’ve got good hopes for both 
those tackles. It’s kind of a race 
to see how fast they can get up 
to speed.”
It’s 
no 
secret 
that 
the 
Wolverines’ offensive line is 
the offense’s — and perhaps 
the entire team’s — bottleneck 
capping 
its 
potential. 
But 
Harbaugh has steadfastly stood 
by his starting five. So why 
would Harbaugh mention two 
backup linemen unprompted?
“They’re in the ballpark,” he 
said of the competition at both 
tackle spots. “So that bodes 
well for us. Want depth there. … 
Whether they’re the best player 
at the position? Time will tell.”
With 
two 
games 
under 
Michigan’s belt, the time for 
Mayfield and Hudson’s possible 
ascendence 
is 
now.

quarterback Shea Patterson has 
flashed his savvy with accurate 
on-the-run throws and evading 
pass rushers, but it hardly seems 
sustainable.
Patterson’s 
mobility 
was 
relatively capped against No. 8 
Notre Dame, with three sacks 
coming on the left side past 
senior tackle Jon Runyan Jr. 
The frequency of quarterback 
hurries allowed by the leaky 
o-line alarms the naked eye, but 
the Wolverines are protective of 
the starting rotation, trying to 
remain loose and disregard any 
ire from the fanbase.
“Most 
people 
do 
not 
understand fundamentally what 
offensive line play is and what 
it entails,” said junior backup 

center 
Stephen 
Spanellis. 
“Someone 
might 
perceive 
something as bad offensive line 
play that in reality is not on us 
or they don’t understand what 
our assignments 
are, so they don’t 
know what we’re 
supposed to do.
“It’s 
a 
complicated 
thing, so people 
often blame us 
but we just try 
to block that out 
and know that as 
a unit we’re solid 
and 
improving 
and we’re gonna 
continue to do that.”
Against Western Michigan 
on Saturday, the offensive line 
was being credited left and 

right for the success of the 
run game, which amassed 308 
yards. Junior running back 
Chris Evans said “you could 
drive a car through” the holes 
they 
produced. 
Patterson 
said 
the offensive line 
“had a heck of a 
game.”
But 
even 
against 
an 
inferior 
team 
like the Broncos, 
pass 
rushers 
made it to the 
backfield several 
times. Spanellis 
admitted 
that 
even on some of the successful 
plays, 
like 
Evans’ 
27-yard 
touchdown run, the offensive 
line 
missed 
blocks. 
Thus, 

frustration persists as eyes peer 
to future foes like Wisconsin 
and Ohio State.
The candid Spanellis, though, 
sees things from a more assured, 
theoretical 
point 
of 
view. 
One of the most 
intelligent 
players on the 
roster, Spanellis 
explained 
the 
nuances 
of 
the 
offensive 
line 
schemes 
academically.
“If 
we’re 
in 
a 
five-man 
protection 
and 
the call-side tackle has to come 
down on a blitzing linebacker 
and leave the end and let him 
go free, the average fan will 

say ‘What the hell is that guy 
doing? He just let up a sack,’ ” 
Spanellis said. “But no, that’s 
his assignment, that’s what he’s 
supposed to do. … You’re gonna 
have to take the 
most dangerous 
guy, 
in 
terms 
of 
if 
you’re 
gonna 
look 
at 
a 
Pythagorean 
triangle, 
the 
guy that’s inside 
is closer to the 
quarterback.”
Harbaugh 
boils down his 
offensive line in 
simpler 
terms. 
After praising Mayfield and 
Hudson, he later circled back 
to compliment the his starters. 
Sophomore center Cesar Ruiz 

was “really good,” junior right 
guard Michael Onwenu “made a 
lot strides,” and Harbaugh was 
“very pleased” with Runyan and 
fifth-year senior right tackle 
Juwann Bushell-Beatty. 
Harbaugh’s words were a 
far cry from any animated, 
overjoyed commendation. But 
his team continues the wait-
and-see approach to display 
pass-blocking improvement.
“I think we’re close,” Spanellis 
said. “I’m not an expert, I don’t 
know when exactly you’ll be 
able to tell exactly when. But I 
think we’re gonna get there. I’m 
not exactly sure what it’s gonna 
look like, but I’m sure it’ll be 
great.”
But through two games and 
with much still to improve, 
impatience can justifiably grow.

Senior left tackle Jon Runyan Jr. has come under increasing fire, especially after junior quarterback Shea Patterson was sacked three times by defenders from the left side against Notre Dame.

“... the guy 
that’s inside is 
closer to the 
quarterback.”

“It’s kind of a 

race to see how 

fast they can get 

up to speed.”
