Starting 
March 

14, the University of 
Michigan will no longer 
require masks in most 
indoor spaces on campus 
including 
offices, 

residence halls and at 
athletic events, Robert 
Ernst, 
associate 
vice 

president of student life, 
and Preeti Malani, U-M 
Chief Health Officer, 
announced in an email 
to the U-M community 
on March 9. Masks 
are still required in all 
classrooms, patient care 
areas, campus buses and 
COVID-19 testing sites 
for at least the remainder 
of the Winter 2022 
semester.

“Mask use still is 

suggested as an effective 
strategy for enhanced 
personal 
protection, 

especially 
for 
those 

with 
compromised 

immune status, those 
who are not vaccinated 
or up to date on their 
COVID-19 vaccinations, 
and 
anyone 
with 
a 

perceived increased risk 
of complications from 
infection,” 
the 
email 

reads. 

In the email, Ernst 

and Malani wrote the 

decision was made due 
to 
high 
vaccination 

rates on campus and 
declining 
COVID-19 

cases in the region. In 
the week ending Feb. 26 
the University reported 
53 preliminary positive 
cases – down from a high 
of 1,927 during the height 
of the omicron surge in 
January. 

“As a result of the 

high vaccination rates 
among students, faculty 
and staff as well as 
improving conditions in 
the region, the COVID-
19 
Campus 
Health 

Response 
Committee 

is issuing new guidance 
regarding 
COVID-

19 response on the 
University of Michigan 
campuses,” the email 
reads. 

All U-M faculty, staff 

and students as well 
as Michigan Medicine 
staff are required to 
be 
fully 
vaccinated 

against 
COVID-19 

and to have received 
a COVID-19 booster 
shot six months after 
their final dose. As 
of 
Wednesday, 
84% 

of 
eligible 
students, 

88% of eligible faculty 
and 83% of eligible 
staff 
have 
reported 

receiving 
a 
booster 

shot.

ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Hail to the Victims demonstration held 

outside President’s House following 

UMich removing campsite

Anderson survivor Jon Vaughn stood chained to a tree for 17.5 hours in defiance against U

“Once again, The University 

of Michigan has historically 
silenced the voices of survivors,” 
reads a sign facing the President’s 
House. To the sign’s right stands 
former 
U-M 
football 
player 

Jonathan Vaughn, bound by 
chains and tied to a tree in an act 
of protest and defiance against 
the University.

“I don’t wish for me or anyone 

else to be tied, bound, gagged, 
neglected or robbed of their 

confidence and health by another 
university again,” the sign reads.

Vaughn told The Daily on March 

12 that starting at 11:26 AM, he 
would stand chained to the tree for 
the next 17.5 hours: one minute for 
every known Anderson survivor. A 
countdown timer sat atop the sign 
to Vaughn’s left.

“There are 1,050 victims that are 

in the first wave of the settlement,” 
Vaughn said. “(The University) is 
trying to keep us chained to our 
trauma. So I’m doing one minute in 
solidarity with the 1,050, so that’s 
how it came out to 17 and a half 
hours.”

Dozens of students, alumni and 

University community members 
gathered in front of the President’s 
House on March 12 in response 
to the University’s removal of the 
“Hail to the Victims” campsite 
after 150 days of protest. Vaughn 
previously told The Michigan Daily 
he was unaware of the University’s 
decision to dismantle the campsite.

Vaughn, one of over a thousand 

sexual abuse survivors of former 
University athletic doctor Robert 
Anderson, said he was wrapped 
in chains to symbolize how the 
University has continued to fail 
survivors such as himself, leaving 

them “tied” and “bound” to their 
trauma. 

Protestors wrote on notecards 

with phrases such as “Hail to the 
Victims” and “No more cover ups” 
and attached them to the chains 
holding Vaughn. He was joined by a 
handful of other survivors who also 
came out in protest of the University.

LSA senior Zackariah Farah, 

vice president of LSA Student 
Government, said the University’s 
behavior toward the Anderson 
survivors has continued to be 
“unacceptable” despite a change in 
leadership in January. The Hail to 
the Victims movement first began 

last October.

“I’m glad that they reached a 

settlement with the survivors, but 
to remove his camp … that is just 
another slap in the face,” Farah said. 
“Although we have new leadership 
at the University, we have President 
Mary Sue Coleman, it feels like we’re 
back to the same old schtick. It’s the 
same response regardless of which 
president we have.”

Farah then said he observed 

similar levels of indifference from 
other University officials at the Feb. 
17 Board of Regents meeting.

As the blue and yellow 

of Ukraine fluttered in 
the wind on the night of 
March 9, many gathered 
at the vigil for war victims 
hosted by members of the 
Ukrainian 
community 

and the Diversity Affairs 
Committee (DAC) of the 
LSA Student Government 
following Russia’s invasion 
of Ukraine. 

Accompanied 
by 

traditional and contemporary 
Ukrainian 
music 
which 

highlighted the Ukrainians’ 
strength, speakers mourned 
for the lives lost in Ukraine 
and urged people to take 
action for the state in crisis. 

Speakers 
included 

students, 
faculty 
and 

community members from 
Ukraine as well as others 
in solidarity with Ukraine. 
Most speakers spoke about 
their friends’ and families’ 
experience with the war and 

how it has affected them 
personally. They advocated 
for 
corporate 
divestment 

from the Russian state. The 
group also asked audience 
members to write letters 
to local officials to create a 
“no-fly zone” over Ukraine 
skies.

Speakers 
included 

Ukrainian 
language 

professors and professors 
who have worked with 
Ukrainians. They said the 
Ukrainians 
they 
worked 

with made a choice to 

stay in Ukraine and were 
determined 
to 
continue 

fighting for both Ukraine 
and Eastern Europe as a 
whole.

Ann 
Arbor 
resident 

Vlada Zviagina, said she has 
family and friends who live 
in Kharkiv, a city in Ukraine 
devastated by and is worried 
about the danger which 
could befall her loved ones 
at any time.

U announces 

transition 
period after 
five-year DEI 
plan, initially 

misstates 
intentions

Chief Diversity Officer 
Robert Sellers launches 

new website, apologizes for 

email wording

The University of 

Michigan is reaching the 
end of its initial five-year 
Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion strategic plan 
(DEI 1.0) and is entering 
into a transitional period 
before the next five-year 
plan, according to a 
March 10 email to the 
campus 
community 

from Robert Sellers, vice 
provost for Equity and 
Inclusion. 

“In 
the 
2022-23 

academic 
year, 
our 

DEI planning efforts 
will rely on the input 
and engagement of our 
community 
to 
build 

out a more strategic, 
focused and impactful 
DEI plan,” Sellers wrote. 
“In fall 2023, U-M will 
officially 
launch 
the 

next DEI strategic plan. 
Throughout our nearly 

two-year 
transition 

process, 
we 
will 

remain vigilant in our 
commitment to DEI as a 
community.”

Launched 
in 

October 
2016, 
the 

DEI 1.0 plan included 
49 
smaller 
plans 

individualized 
for 

each 
college 
and 

program. The plan also 
introduced Wolverine 
Pathways 
and 
the 

HAIL Program, which 
aimed 
to 
increase 

enrollment of minority 
students and support 
socioeconomic 
diversity. Other parts 
of the plan included 
providing 
financial 

support to University 
programs conducting 
research on diversity, 
as well as providing 
intercultural training 
for students, faculty 
and staff.

 U-M admin 
takes down 
protest 
location after 
150 days 

 Protestors say they were unaware 

of removal

On 
March 
7, 

the 
University 
of 

Michigan removed the 
campsite 
outside 
of 

the President’s House 
on 
South 
University 

Avenue, where for the 
last 150 days, former 
U-M 
football 
player 

Jonathan Vaughn lived 
in protest against the 
University’s 
sexual 

misconduct policies. 

Vaughn, 
who 
is 

one of the over one 
thousand sexual abuse 
survivors of the late 
athletic doctor Robert 
Anderson, 
told 
The 

Michigan 
Daily 
on 

Tuesday that he was 
not made aware that 
the 
University 
had 

planned to remove the 
campsite. Vaughn said 
the campsite is on Ann 
Arbor city property, and 
his attorney together 
with 
the 
Assistant 

City Attorney of Ann 
Arbor had come to an 
agreement that they 

were 
planning 
on 

moving 
the 
camp 

by the end of day on 
March 13. According 
to Vaughn, University 
attorneys were also 
aware of the plan. 

“My 
birthday 
is 

on the 12th and I was 
planning on having 
an awesome goodbye 
celebration 
with 

students and faculty 
just to tell them how 
much we appreciate 
it and (then) we were 
gonna start moving 
to the next phase of 
helping 
make 
this 

campus safe,” Vaughn 
said. 
“So 
for 
(the 

University) to do that, 
after they knew what 
our plan was, it just 
goes to show who 
they are right now as 
an organization and 
leadership.” 

University 

spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald declined to 
comment on whether 
or not the University 
was aware of Vaughn’s 
plan to leave.

move

JULIANNE YOON/Daily

When Nate Phipps, the 

co-founder of Bike Alliance 

of Washtenaw and managing 

director of the Center for 

Education Design, Evaluation 

and Research at the University 

of Michigan, first moved to 

Ann Arbor from Boston in 2014, 

he said he felt disappointed by 

the comparative lack of biking 

infrastructure. 
Since 
then, 

Phipps decided to get involved 

in community organizing to 

make Ann Arbor more bike-

friendly.

“My (first) impression was 

that (Ann Arbor) is fine for 

me, but it’s not fine for people 

who are more cautious or less 

experienced riding in a city,” 

Phipps said. “For a decade, 

Ann Arbor was behind (in) 

real 
progressive 
bicycle 

infrastructure.”

Since Phipps arrived, biking 

infrastructure in Ann Arbor 

has improved substantially. In 

December 2021, Ann Arbor 

was named by the League 

of American Bicyclists as a 

Gold-level 
Bicycle 
Friendly 

Community 
in 
recognition 

of 
recent 
infrastructure 

improvements, with its bike 

lanes expanding from 37.4 

miles in 2012 to 90.1 miles in 

2022. Across the U.S., 35 of 

850 communities who applied 

were 
awarded 
Gold-level 

status, with just 5 awarded the 

highest status: Platinum-level. 

This award is not only based on 

quantitative data — such as the 

number of bikers and miles of 

bike paths — but also takes into 

account community education 

and biker advocacy.

In July 2020, the city of Ann 

Arbor also implemented the 

Healthy Street Pilot Projects, 

which included closing off 

downtown streets to expand 

social distancing procedures for 

pedestrians and bicycle traffic. 

State Street and its intersection 

with North University as well 

as Catherine Street and Miller 

Avenue are two major street 

areas included in the project. 

City Council’s July resolution 

asks the Ann Arbor Downtown 

Development 
Authority 
to 

implement the project through 

2022, so the project will return 

again this spring. 

While the city is supportive 

of biking infrastructure, since 

it aligns with the A2ZERO 

plan 
to 
achieve 
carbon 

neutrality 
by 
2030, 
biking 

development in Ann Arbor still 

has room to improve. To take 

a deeper look into the current 

state of biking accessibility, The 

Michigan Daily spoke with 

multiple cyclists and bike-lane 

advocates to discuss safety and 

accessibility concerns they have 

about biking infrastructure in 

Ann Arbor today. 

Inter-campus commuting 

concerns

Fred Feng, U-M Dearborn 

researcher 
and 
assistant 

professor of industrial and 

manufacturing 
systems 

engineering, said he biked 

over the East Medical Center 

Bridge hundreds of times 

during the five years he was a 

Ph.D. student at the Ann Arbor 

campus. The Fuller and East 

Medical Center Bridge leads to 

the University’s medical center 

and connects the Central and 

North Campuses. Recently, 

the Ann Arbor City Council 

approved a proposal to widen 

the bridge with a fifth lane for 

automobiles, which prompted 

community 
backlash, 

particularly from pedestrians 

and cyclists who rely on the 

bridge for daily commuting. 

Based 
on 
his 
research 

into 
safe 
and 
sustainable 

transportation methods as well 

as his personal experiences, 

Feng said the proposed design 

for the Medical Center Bridge 

is not only counterproductive 

to climate change mitigation 

efforts — by accommodating 

more vehicle traffic — but also 

exacerbates 
existing 
safety 

challenges to cyclists.

“The 
Federal 
Highway 

Administration recommended 

a minimum of 5 feet width for 

people to walk side-by-side 

(in one direction),” Feng said. 

“A total of 8 feet, which is the 

width of the new design on 

the west side, was too narrow 

even for current bi-direction 

walking and biking traffic.”

The 
University’s 

community relations director 

Michael Rein suggested at the 

Feb. 7 City Council meeting 

that reducing the width on 

the west side of the bridge to 8 

feet will be offset by widening 

the east side of the bridge to 13 

feet, which could divert some 

non-motorized traffic from the 

west. Feng, however, warned 

it might be more difficult 

than the University thinks for 

commuters to adjust their usual 

routes in light of the changes.

“If we learned something 

from the past decades, it is 

that some people are going 

to do things that make the 

most sense to them,” Feng 

said. 
“Simply 
narrowing 

the 
west 
side 
of 
the 

bridge, which is the most 

straightforward connection 

for many, and telling (them) 

not to use it is highly 

unlikely to work.”

BUSINESS
Condado Tacos combines signature flavors, 
grafti-style art in new downtown location

Ohio-based company opens with a special “Year of Yum” for first 100 customers

Downtown Ann Arbor 

is now home to its very own 

Condado Tacos, a build-

your-own taco joint complete 

with vibrant floor-to-ceiling 

murals 
and 
a 
signature 

margarita menu. 

The Ohio-based company 

opened its new location to 

the public on March 3 with a 

special “Year of Yum” which 

offered the first one hundred 

visitors one free taco per 

week for a year. The eatery 

also offered all customers $5 

margaritas and the chance to 

win a $1,000 gift card.

The opening-day special 

offerings attracted hundreds 

of 
students 
and 
local 

residents to the restaurant, 

with the first visitors lining 

up as early as 8 a.m. LSA 

senior Katherine Springer 

said she attended the opening 

for the chance of earning a 

year’s worth of free tacos, 

especially 
since 
she 
has 

visited other locations of 

Condado Tacos.

“We 
love 
free 
food,” 

Springer said. “My sister 

actually 
lives 
outside 
of 

Cincinnati (and) she has 

(Condado Tacos locations) 

around her so we’ll go to eat 

(there). And I know they’re 

really good tacos, so I just got 

really excited.”

Since 
the 
company’s 

establishment in 2014, 30 

Condado 
Tacos 
locations 

have 
popped 
up 
across 

six states in the Midwest. 

According to Rob Hanley, the 

Ann Arbor location’s general 

manager, 401 E. Liberty 

Street 
is 
the 
company’s 

fourth 
installment 
in 

Southeastern 
Michigan’s 

Detroit metropolitan area.

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily, Hanley said 

he attributed much of the 

opening day’s success to the 

company’s reputation across 

the Midwest. 

“We got past a hundred 

(people by) around 9:15,” 

Hanley said. “We have a lot 

of people that go around 

the Midwest, where we’re 

predominantly 
located, 

(who) want to come in (and) 

be one of the first ones in 

the space to see all the new 

artwork and stuff like that … 

So we filled up shortly after 

we opened for the first time 

at 11.”

Inside, the restaurant’s 

wall murals are filled with 

vibrant splashes of color 

and graffiti-style lettering. 

One tag reads “University 

of Yum,” referencing the 

location’s proximity to the 

University 
of 
Michigan’s 

campus. Hanley said the 

restaurant collaborated with 

local artists to bring the 

indoor space to life.

“We hire a lot of local 

muralists and artists to come 

in and give our space a unique 

and very vibrant display,” 

Hanley said. “We are very big 

on supporting the arts … Part 

of our building is (designed) 

to remind people of the Ann 

Arbor Graffiti Alley. So we 

have portions of our building 

that recreates that vibe with 

the different types of graffiti 

art that artists came in and 

did.”

LSA junior Zhen Lin said 

the restaurant’s ambiance 

was 
well-suited 
to 
the 

younger demographic of U-M 

students.

“The first thing I really 

like is the environment and 

the backdrop,” Lin said. “I 

think it’s more fitting to 

our generation. We like to 

Instagram a lot of our food 

and (take) pictures around 

them. (This) is the perfect 

place to do that, everything’s 

really eye-appealing.”

Hanley said the restaurant 

is looking forward to creating 

new job opportunities within 

the local community.

“We’re big believers in 

‘come as you are,’” Hanley 

said. “Being able to give 

opportunities to people to 

(grow with the company) 

and advance themselves … 

Being able to employ a lot of 

the local people is absolutely 

amazing … We don’t have 

a uniform, we want you to 

come as you are.”

“FEELINGS” ARE AMONG the hard-

est concepts to grasp, and even harder to 
reflect on enough to write about them. I 
once heard that the more specific art gets, 
the more universally relatable it becomes. I 
am proud of how these writers, compiling 
their hearts for “The Empathy B-Side,” have 
parsed all the tiny details of their feelings, 
opening their minds and lives to readers 
and bringing their emotions together into a 
collection guaranteed to tear at your heart 
and knit it back into one piece. It is hard to 
create one definition of a feeling: Everyone 
wears grief differently, and same goes for 
love, humor, horror. Thank god we have 
our favorite books and movies and video 
games and songs as shining mercies to point 
to and connect over with others, or at least 
feel a connection to these pieces that have 

helped us learn more about ourselves. Art 
serves as a constant reminder that we are 

unravelled and put back together at the 
hands and the grace of others.

I WASN’T EXPECTING anything in par-

ticular when I sent my DNA collection kit to 
23andMe, but I was still met with a confusing 
ambivalence when I got my results back a few 
weeks later. Before I found myself staring at a pie 
chart filled with just one color and its accompa-
nying “100% Chinese & Southeast Asian” label, I 
had only ever thought of my ethnicity in abstract 
terms.

The circumstances of my birth are entirely 

unknown to me. As far as I know, my life started 
when I was about two months old, but even that 
is just a supposition. I’ve been told by my moth-
er, who was told by the orphanage from which 
I was adopted, that I was found as an about-
two-month-old baby in front of a high school in 
central China. The people at the orphanage (a 
faceless, disembodied monolith that only exists 
in my vague and infrequent references to it) gave 
me a birthday — Jan. 1, a ballpark guess — and a 
name that’s still legally mine even in my adoptive 
country, but that I never use and haven’t spoken 

aloud in years.

Growing up, my family theorized that I might 

be half white, an idea I went along with whole-
heartedly. In retrospect, I’ve realized that this 
idea is intensely problematic, especially coming 
from my white adoptive family, especially as 
it was almost entirely based on superficial and 
reaching observations about my physical fea-
tures. I have a natural double eyelid, something 
that a lot of Asian women go through cosmetic 
surgery to obtain, and I have relatively fair skin, 
which somehow managed to be a point in this 
theory’s favor, even though a lot of Chinese peo-
ple have fairer skin than mine. For years, I touted 
this idea as if it somehow made me more interest-
ing, but all it ever really did was reveal my des-
peration to be able to personally claim whiteness.

It was probably the vestiges of this despera-

tion and the deeper, internalized racial biases it 
revealed that, admittedly, led to disappointment 
in finding out I was indisputably, unequivocally, 
100% Chinese, but upon further introspection, I 
realized that there was something else contrib-
uting to my ambivalence.

I’ve spent most of my life feeling like a fraud in 

my own skin. There has always been a dissocia-

tion between me and my ethnicity, created by my 
physical and intellectual distance from the cul-
ture I was born into and exacerbated by interac-
tions with people who felt they could make final 
judgments about my Asianness (or, in most cases, 
lack thereof), even and sometimes, especially, in 
spaces meant to educate me about and encourage 
my Asianness.

Even though it was just confirming something 

about me that was always more likely to be true 
than a half-baked theory about having a white 
parent, I thought that having categorical proof 
that I was indisputably, unequivocally, 100% 
Chinese might resolve something about my 
identity for me, make me feel more comfortable 
claiming this part of me even if others doubted 
it — but it didn’t resolve anything. This indeter-
mination, this tangle of identity and internalized 
racism and “culturelessness” is something that 
I’ve come to a kind of restless, uncertain peace 
with. Usually, I love finding answers, I love reso-
lutions, but this is something that — not for lack 
of trying — I’ve come to realize I may never be 
able to fully reconcile.

The Empathy B-Side

‘It feels like a costume’: Validating my cultural 

uncertainty with Diane Nguyen

‘Piglet’s Big Movie’ and 

my big emotions

I WAS AN anxious kid. It sounds 

like the beginning of a bit, but it’s 
true. I was anxious about a lot of 
things. Sleep was a big one: I would 
spend a lot of nights thinking about 
how I wasn’t falling asleep, which in 
turn made it harder to fall asleep. I 
was plagued with other irrational 
anxieties — that no one liked me, 
that my family would forget about 
me, that something catastrophic 
would completely upend my life.

Like a lot of kids, I watched 

Winnie the Pooh when I was little, 
specifically the 2003 spinoff film 
“Piglet’s Big Movie.” I remember 
being most captivated not by Pooh 
or Tigger or Christopher Robin, but 
by Piglet, the small, anxiety-ridden 
stuffed pig. And it wasn’t until more 
recently that I understood why.

In 2000, there was a study pub-

lished in a Canadian medical journal 
positing a theory that “diagnosed” 
all of the Winnie the Pooh charac-
ters, showing that they could all be 

representations of various psycho-
logical disorders. According to the 
study, Pooh and Tigger both had 
forms of ADHD, Eeyore suffered 
from dysthymia (depression), Owl 
was dyslexic and Rabbit had a form 
of what might be narcissistic per-
sonality disorder. Piglet, of course, 
was diagnosed with General Anxi-
ety Disorder.

The study was mostly done as a 

tongue-in-cheek thought experi-
ment, but there is certainly truth 
to some of the claims. When I first 
learned about this in my intro-
ductory psychology class, I found 
myself overwhelmed by a feeling of 
comprehension. This was why I had 
always felt so connected to Piglet. 
We saw the world in a similar way, 
and we shared some of the same 
anxieties.

It’s true that it’s a little strange to 

be so drawn to a character whose 
catchphrase is “Oh, d-d-dear!,” but 
I know that I’m not the only one. 
Piglet is not flashy like Tigger, ador-
able like Roo or silly like Pooh. And 
yet there’s something so relatable 
about him and his fears that it makes 
grown adults put their hand over 
their heart and affectionately evoke 
his name. He is beloved by many, 
including me.

In many Winnie the Pooh stories, 

Piglet is overshadowed; in “Piglet’s 
Big Movie,” though, he finally gets a 
chance to shine. “Piglet’s Big Movie” 
follows the crew of Pooh (Jim Cum-
mings, “Christopher Robin”), Tig-
ger (also Cummings), Rabbit (Ken 
Sansom, “The New Adventures of 
Winnie the Pooh”), Eeyore (Peter 
Cullen, “Transformers: The Last 
Knight”) and Roo (Nikita Hopkins, 
“Pooh’s Heffalump Movie”). The 
group, thinking they’ve lost Piglet 
(John Fiedler, “The Many Adven-
tures of Winnie the Pooh”), start 
following a scrapbook of memories 
to give them clues as to his where-
abouts and end up reminiscing on 
the memories themselves. It’s true 
that it’s riddled with plot holes (Pig-
let is supposedly also looking for his 
friends, and they somehow never 
run into each other at all — the Hun-
dred Acre Wood isn’t that big, is it?), 
but it’s a kid’s movie that packs a 
more emotional punch into a short 
75 minutes than most movies pack 
into a full runtime. Also, it has ador-
able, catchy songs by ’70s folk queen 
Carly Simon.

I watched this movie a lot as a kid, 

and I always loved it. In some ways, 
it’s a very goofy movie; my sister and 
I loved quoting our favorite lines at 
each other because some of them are 
so comically random and randomly 
comical. But the other half of the 
film’s emotional impact is the focus 
on Piglet’s anxieties and on the way 
that his friends neglected him. To 
this day, this movie makes me cry 
every time I watch it.

There’s 
a 
running 
theme 

throughout the movie that Piglet 

is “too small.” Piglet’s smallness is 
a reason that they leave him out of 
some of their wild antics; it’s the rea-
son that they instantly jump to the 
conclusion that Piglet is in trouble 
once they can’t find him. Piglet is 
made to believe that his size means 
that he isn’t a helpful or useful friend 
to rely on. But with the musical 
number “If I Wasn’t So Small,” he 
starts doing a bunch of small deeds 
— helping a ladybug cross to another 
plant, helping a squirrel get a “hay-
corn” and helping a bird get back to 
its nest. That’s all it takes to reverse 
his mindset — he can be helpful. 
And when he thinks that his friends 
are in trouble, he sets aside all of his 
anxieties to go after them.

His friends, however, take lon-

ger to come around. Throughout 
the film, as they move through 
the memories, there’s a recurring 
thread of Piglet’s deeds getting over-
shadowed or the credit for his work 
getting stolen by someone else. And 
Piglet usually just accepts it. There’s 
a moment of “b-b-but,” but in the 
end he always smiles and lets his 
friends have their moment: He just 

wants other people to be happy. It’s 
not until they’re running through 
the stories again that they realize 
everything he has done for them and 
how they never let him know how 
much they love and respect him.

For me, the emotional pinnacle 

hits in the third act of the movie. 
Pooh and co., trying to stay out of the 
rain, have returned to Piglet’s house, 
dejected. They’ve lost the scrapbook, 
and they’ve lost hope of finding Pig-
let. A poignant Carly Simon song, 
“The More I Look Inside,” plays as 
the crew laments their inability to 
find their friend and that they had 
failed to appreciate him before now.

And then everything begins to 

flip. They start to draw their own 
pictures in the style of Piglet’s scrap-
book: stories of times that Piglet 
helped them. They draw him as a 
knight, an explorer, an adventurer 
— not someone meek and anxious, 
but someone bold and confident. 
But in my most recent rewatch, the 
part that made me cry the most was 
when cranky, cantankerous Rabbit 
held up the picture he’d drawn of 
him and Piglet, with two beautiful, 
simple words: “My friend.”

At the end, when Piglet returns to 

his house to find all of the drawings 
that his friends have made for him, 
his eyes fill with tears. So do mine. 
Because in the eyes of his friends, he 
isn’t small — he’s big, and brave, and 
bright.

All these years later, there are 

three main things that I learned 
from “Piglet’s Big Movie” that have 
stuck with me:

1. Don’t take your friends for 

granted. A true friend will do things 
without being asked, but that doesn’t 
mean that you shouldn’t appreciate 
them.

2. A small act of kindness is just 

as generous as a large one. Taking a 
small part of your day to make some-
one’s life easier is gratifying, wheth-
er you get recognition for it or not.

3. Being anxious doesn’t mean 

that you can’t be brave. Being small 
doesn’t mean that you can’t be a 
hero.

When it comes to empathy, we 

usually talk about trying to put your-
self in someone else’s shoes, trying 
to understand someone else’s emo-
tional experience from their point 
of view. For me, “Piglet’s Big Movie” 
was never really about empathy, 
because it was already something I 
connected with. I saw Piglet’s anxi-
eties and saw my own. I saw him left 
out by his friends and was reminded 
of some of my own friendships. I 
saw him keep trying to be seen, to 
love and be loved, and I related. And 
when I saw Piglet push through his 
fears to help his friends, I felt like 
that was something I could do too. 
I could also be brave, even when it 
scared me.

This was supposed to be a piece about ‘Life is Strange: True Colors’

Empathy for the emotionless: Understanding OMORI

‘The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue’ is shelter from 

the storm

Sitting with words: 
poetry to inspire 

empathy

Content Warning: This piece 

includes 
allusions 
to 
anti-

LGBTQ+ 
legislation, 
suicide 

and the invasion of Ukraine. 
Also, 
spoilers 
for 
“Life 
is 

Strange: True Colors.”

I HAD PLANNED for this 

article to be about the video 
game “Life is Strange: True 
Colors.” Released in Septem-
ber 2021, “True Colors” cen-
ters on Alex Chen, a latchkey 
kid who’s re-entering society 
after finally learning to con-
trol her superpowers. Alex is 
an empath — seriously, she can 
read other people’s emotions 
and hear their thoughts. Kinda 
a neat, if useless superpower, 
right? Except, Alex can also 
get overwhelmed by powerful 

emotions; for example, grow-
ing enraged or depressed when 
someone 
around 
her 
does. 

What’s brilliant — and ter-
rifying — about Alex’s power 
is that it doesn’t feel fiction-
al: Everyone claims to be an 
empath, after all. And being an 
empath in our modern world is 
simply exhausting.

It’s hard to talk about these 

imaginary exploits of Alex 
within the fictitious town of 
Haven, Colo. when in real-
ity, Florida has made it dan-
gerous to say the word gay. 
Queer folk around the country 
became targets the moment 
Florida’s House of Represen-
tatives passed a law to keep 
schools from talking about 
LGBTQIA+ topics within the 
classroom. In a time when 
children are presented with 
more information than ever 

to help them answer difficult 
questions of identity and sexu-
ality, the classroom has been 
turned into a warzone. Parents 
screech that they are “protect-
ing their children,” that “the 
gay agenda must be stopped” 
as if education and compassion 
turn you queer. School, the one 
place that may have been a safe 
haven for students with these 
identities who have unsup-
portive parents or dangerous 
living situations, is now off 
limits. 

Where can these kids go but 

back into the closet? Because 
the world shows every sign 
that it does not love them, 
that they are an aberration. 
A mistake. Who they are and 
who they love does not mat-
ter to the Republican Party of 
Florida. How can you be for 
the children when, accord-

ing to The Trevor Project, an 
LGBTQ+ youth between the 
ages of 13 and 24 will attempt 
suicide 
every 
45 
seconds? 

Everyone outside of the Sun-
shine State with a heart imme-
diately understood the panic, 

fury, hopelessness and fear 
that these children all felt, and 
that’s without Alex’s empathy 
superpower.

My 
original 
article 
was 

going to say that “True Col-
ors” makes it clear that Alex 

Chen has not had an easy 
life: Her mother died of can-
cer, her father abandoned her 
and her brother Gabe and not 
long after, Gabe got sent to 
juvie which separating them 
for good. Alex was shuffled 
around the foster care system; 
her powers made her too vola-
tile to stay with one family or 
group home for too long. One 
heartbreaking 
scene 
forces 

Alex to relive these moments, 
her 
tele-empathy 
allowing 

her to hear every judgmental 
thought from the rotating gal-
lery of people who make up her 
teenage years. Alex has seen 
the absolute worst in people, 
and yet she still wants to live a 
happy life and use her powers 
to help others. 

Content Warning: Discussions 

of anxiety and depression

Author’s Note: Many details of 

the plot of “OMORI” were with-
held for the sake of preserving 
the impact of its story. Likewise, 
many details of my disorders 
were withheld for the sake of my 
privacy. Everything I have dis-
cussed is material I’m comfort-
able publishing because I have 
extensively unpacked it while 
getting the professional help I 
needed in therapy. If you empa-
thize with any of what has been 
discussed in this piece, I would 
urge you to please use whatever 
resources are available to you to 
get the help you need. Thank you 
for reading.

VIDEO GAMES HAVE always 

been an escape for me. It’s a 
medium I find more engaging 
than any other — the audiovisual 
stimulation of videos and music 
mix with an interactive story, 
allowing you to insert yourself 
into a narrative shaped by your 
actions. As a kid, I fell into a 
variety of deeply engrossing 
media, but video games would 

remain the most immersive. In 
my somewhat lonely childhood 
— a combination of overprotec-
tive immigrant parents, a some-
what childless neighborhood on 
the edge of town and my cul-
tural disconnection being a Desi 
student in a school of white kids 
— I sought these immersions as 
escapes from a duller and dis-
connected reality. Real life was 
where my numerous childhood 
fears sprouted: fear of the dark, 
heights, bugs, open water, the 
supernatural. The end result 
left me as a primary schooler 
refusing a solitary bedroom 
until middle school. It was at 
this point I found friends with 
similar backgrounds & inter-
ests — video games being a focal 
point. 

The RPG “OMORI” opens 

with the following message 
upon booting up: “This game 
contains depictions of depres-
sion, anxiety, suicide, and may 
not be suitable for all audi-
ences.” Despite this warning, 
at first glance the game seems 
like a cheery, fun-filled romp. 
Wholesome hand-drawn art, 
pretty pixelated visuals and 
facetious Photoshops all mix 
together to create the won-

drous, dreamlike world you play 
through. You play as Omori, 
a comically stoic child as he 
adventures with his much-more 
expressive friends: hard-headed 
Aubrey, enthusiastic Kel and his 
gentle older brother, Hero. They 
quest to save their bashful best 
friend Basil, helped along from 
the sidelines by Omori’s older 
sister, Mari.

The characters’ expressive-

ness is an extension of the game 
itself, the main fights operating 
on a rock-paper-scissors system 
of the emotions of characters 
and enemies: happy beats angry, 
angry beats sad, sad beats 
happy. Omori can be manipu-
lated by the player to emotional 
depths that his friends cannot 
reach, giving him the potential 
to be more powerful or more 
vulnerable than any of his other 
friends. Together, they fight and 
befriend the most colorful of 
characters. Omori’s friends are 
the most engaging, the game’s 
length giving you a wealth 
of adorable interactions that 
flesh out how much they care 
for each other. There is never a 
still moment in the game, with 
cutscenes, sprites, backgrounds, 
battles and characters in con-

stant animation. The frame-by-
frame differences breathe life 
into the game, as change is a 
vital part of life. It’s that truth 
— and the truth of Omori’s story 
— that shatters your heart and 
shatters the leftover shards, 
leaving your friends to pick up 
the pieces but ultimately leav-
ing you to put yourself back 
together.

I spent much of my second-

ary education entangled in my 
emotions. Throughout middle 
school I’d find myself kept up at 
night due to paranoia leftover 
from my childhood. Thank-
fully, they’d transition from 
irrational phobias to elevated 
anxieties about going into high 
school and my future. This 
stress built in high school as I 
took on workloads so heavy I 
had to constantly isolate myself 
from friends — both new and 
old — to manage it all. The con-
sequences of those couple years 
would manifest in the spring 
of my sophomore year, when 
I was diagnosed with Crohn’s 
disease, an autoimmune disor-
der that flares up with stress. 
I had to conquer my anxiety 
to put my disease into submis-
sion, and I couldn’t rely on the 

aid of anti-anxiety medication 
that could potentially disturb 
the bodily homeostasis treat-
ing Crohn’s needs — though I 
will emphasize that this was a 
personal choice on the behalf 
of my family and myself and 
that everyone is impacted by 
and treats Crohn’s differently. 
In meditation, in safe spaces, 
in detachment, in deep-breath-
ing techniques, in every coping 
mechanism I could muster, I 
fought my fears and won time 
after time. But in that work was 
a wish I had since my childhood 
panics — a wish to stop feeling 
altogether. My wish was grant-
ed when I started experiencing 
depressive episodes after my 
Crohn’s diagnosis.

Little things seem off at the 

start of “OMORI”: an ominous 
shadow lurking in the distance, 
a distressing opening cutscene 
with the repeating assurance 
that everything is going to be 
okay, sketches colored by void-
white, ink-black and blood-red. 
The player learns that Omori’s 
fantastical world is actually a 
fantasy — a dreamworld con-
cocted by the true protagonist 
Sunny, Omori’s teenage coun-
terpart. Sunny has been living 

as a hikikomori, a Japanese term 
for social recluse and Omori’s 
etymological origin, from child-
hood into adolescence following 
a traumatic experience, escap-
ing into his dreamworld when-
ever possible.

His childhood friends have 

been damaged by both this 
same trauma and Sunny’s aban-
donment of them. Mari is gone, 
Kel smiles through the pain, 
Aubrey lashes out at her former 
friends and Hero struggles with 
overwhelming sadness. Basil 
is a nervous wreck always on 
the verge of panic attacks, and 
all five friends suffer in Mari’s 
absence. Sunny feels it the most, 
no longer having his older sister 
to protect him from his fears and 
the truth of his trauma, a truth 
that only Basil knows. Sunny 
and Omori are forced through 
terrifying sequences character-
ized by horrifying hand-drawn 
art, unnerving pixelated visu-

than that, however, Sunny has 
to confront the new people his 
friends have become and the 
truth of what split them apart. 

NOVEMBER 2020. COVID-19 

had just booted me out of Ann 
Arbor and sent me home. As I 
finished up my first semester 
of college from my childhood 
bedroom, I felt it — the feeling 
I would come to label as “the 
storm.” It was the first time I 
felt my mental health truly dip, 
a loneliness that seeped through 
my entire body into my bones. 
So I did what I always do when I 
need to put my mind elsewhere: 
I picked up a book. This time, it 
was “The Invisible Life of Addie 
LaRue” by V. E. Schwab.

Art has always been my medi-

um of escapism. Whether it be 
books, television, movies or a 
trip to a museum, I have been 
using art to get outside my own 
head from a very young age. It’s 
why I spent the year between 
ages eight and nine imagin-
ing myself at Hogwarts and 
why now, almost 11 years later, 
I undertake “Harry Potter” 
movie marathons biannually. 
It’s why I try to visit The Met-
ropolitan Museum of Art when 
I come home to New York and 
I take a trip to the University of 
Michigan Museum of Art almost 
every Friday at school. Since 
my field of study is pure STEM, 
full of straightforward and rigid 
answers, I find it necessary to 
have an outlet for all that goes 
unexpressed.

I expected “Invisible Life” 

to take me to a new world with 
magic, Faustian bargains and 
adventure. While those ele-
ments were present, I was more 
shocked to find my own experi-
ences reflected right back at me. 
A 323-year-old woman cursed 
with eternal youth and health, 
unable to leave a mark on the 
world, and a man cursed with 
a year of life in which everyone 
sees only what they want in him. 
Where do I fit in? Apparently, 

everywhere.

Addie is a dreamer. In many 

ways she’s like Belle from 
“Beauty and the Beast,” dream-
ing of adventure in the “great 
wide somewhere,” with a strong 
connection to art and a deep 
admiration of her father. Any-
one who knows me well knows 
that “Beauty and the Beast” has 
always been my favorite fai-
rytale, and so I was instantly 
drawn in. Addie’s story, how-

ever, rips away that glimmering 
facade of the Disney princess 
and dives in deeper. Addie gets 
her wish for freedom by literally 
trading her soul, and from that 
point on, her world is turned 
upside down. She is unable to 
be wounded, fall sick or die. 
But she’s also unable to leave an 
impression or a memory of her-
self. Everyone she meets forgets 
her; every mark she makes dis-
appears. 

“Stories are a way to preserve 

oneself. To be remembered. 
And to forget.” Addie’s connec-
tion with books is one I related 
to right off the bat. Schwab’s 
language captured the feeling 
of escapism through literature 
perfectly. Addie deems art as 
necessary to her survival in her 
infinitely long life. Her descrip-
tions of watching movies and 
seeing the sea for the first time 

brought out the same emotions 
I felt while sitting in a theater 
or standing on the shore. Addie 
truly felt the beauty of the world, 
and I did too. Yet despite hav-
ing access to so many beautiful 
experiences, Addie felt lonely in 
her life. And I did too. It was this 
empathy that I carried with me 
throughout the rest of the book.

Just when I thought I couldn’t 

relate to a character more, Henry 
burst onto the scene. Henry was 

the second character in this 
novel to strike a deal with the 
devil, though for very different 
reasons and for much less time. 
As a bookseller, he had that same 
level of admiration and under-
standing of good art. As a human, 
he had experiences that put 
everything I was feeling at the 
time into words. It was because 
of Henry that I labeled that peri-
od in my life as “the storm.” As 
Schwab put it, “It would be years 
before Henry learned to think 
of those dark times as storms, 
to believe that they would pass, 
if he could simply hold on long 
enough.” Henry’s bouts of rain 
came about due to his feelings of 
loneliness, those feelings of not 
being enough that seem to be all 
too common among people my 
age. It didn’t take much for him 
to start feeling that way again. 
Anything could be a catalyst — a 

parent’s disapproval, a profes-
sor’s admonishment, a lover’s 
rejection. Henry was so tired 
of battening down the hatches 
that he traded his soul to just be 
enough for everyone. 

Henry understood too late 

that you can’t make people love 
you, and if you’re really enough 
for everyone, then you’re doing 
something wrong. People aren’t 
meant for everyone — all you 
need is to be enough for your-
self. As Henry spoke about talk-
ing to his family who wouldn’t 
understand 
because 
they’ve 

“never had a day of rain,” I felt 
it in the pit of my stomach. I 
felt it because I did understand, 
because I was weathering my 
own storm. 

Addie 
and 
Henry’s 
time 

together was electric for both 
of them. Like all good things, 
however, it came to an end. Each 
went their own way understand-
ing the importance of life and 
living it on your own terms. 
Both Henry and Addie left a 
piece of themselves with the 
other person, something that 
gave them the strength to keep 
going. Unbeknownst to them, 
they also left those pieces with 
me. As Addie and Henry taught 
me, I needed to find the beauty 
in life — in art — and understand 
that being alone is not the same 
as being lonely. Most of all, I had 
to believe with all my heart that 
at the end of the day, the storm 
always passes.

I read “The Invisible Life of 

Addie LaRue” for the second 
time a few days before writ-
ing this. On my second read-
through, I found myself learning 
just as much as I did the first 
time around when I was in a 
completely different headspace. 
No matter how many times I 
return to this book, I think the 
message will always remain the 
same: There is no obstacle too 
large to overcome, and life’s 
wonders 
always 
make 
sur-

mounting them worth it.

POETRY 
HAS 
IMMENSE 

reverberating power. Verse has 
that ability: We keep snippets 
and sections of it in our minds, 
carry our favorite poem’s lines 
with us like pendants, thinking 
on them in our time of need. 

Poetry’s elasticity, the breadth 

of its expressiveness given the 
sparseness of its text, is immea-
surably powerful. Poetry can 
pull us from fear and ground 
us in our reality, but perhaps — 
most remarkably — allows us to 
sit with someone, to feel their 
pain, their fear, their love and 
the wideness of their experi-
ence. 

And poetry has always been 

a space for embodiment. This is 
something audaciously intrinsic 
to the medium: You, the reader, 
are involved in poetry’s inven-
tion and intention, transfigured 
by the word and the chasms of 
the page. To me, empathy in the 
written word is all about this 
active practice of embodiment: 
When something is written so 
wholly to the nature of a thing, 
we get a true sense of its weight. 
Empathy, after all, is not some-
thing that you are but something 
you do. We can all listen, we can 
all learn from one another — and 
here are three collections that 
will help you do just that.

“Empathy” 
by 
Mei-mei 

Berssenbrugge

Empathy, in Mei-mei Bers-

senbrugge’s lauded collection 
“Empathy,” goes beyond human 
connection 
and 
asks: 
What 

does it take to become someone, 
something beyond human exis-
tence? Empathy not only mani-
fests humans in understanding 
and solidarity but is all-encom-
passing — bringing forth wid-
ened images of her speaker as 

a natural subject, of incorpo-
real feelings and sensations. In 
the book, we are asked to look 
beyond humanity, to understand 
what it may be like to be unex-
amined or animal. The poems 
feel more like fields of energy — 
Berssenbrugge so carefully cre-
ated speculative worlds in lieu 
of poetry. By allowing us to sit 
in the discomfort of the world, 
she forces us to grapple with the 
subjects, and in turn, empathize 
with them. 

“Words Under the Words” 

by Naomi Shihab Nye

If there is one thing celebrat-

ed Palestinian-American poet 
Naomi Shihab Nye is known 
for, it’s her sensitive approach 
to writing: Her poems are 
chaste in their verbiage. Her 
language is plain and simple 
as her metaphors concerning 
“bread,” “mountains” and “riv-
ers” brim with the kindness and 
warmth of the human spirit. 
In “Words Under the Words,” 
Nye views the world with the 
utmost humanitarian spirit. In 
her work, every story, no matter 
how paltry, is one worth exam-
ining. Every person she recalls 
is a site of great tenderness and 
love. If there is one thing Nye 
loves, it’s the little things — what 
she loves more is understanding 
those things with the tenderness 
her poetry provides to the world. 
The collection’s most regarded 
poem says it best: “Then it is 
only kindness that makes sense 
anymore / only kindness that 
ties your shoes / and sends you 
out into the day to gaze at bread, 
/ only kindness that raises its 
head / from the crowd of the 
world to say / It is I you have 
been looking for, / and then goes 
with you everywhere / like a 
shadow or a friend.”

What

The first anime that I had ever 

seen was “Naruto,” probably the 
most popular and entry-level anime 
that you could watch. At the time, 
8-year-old me obviously did not 
know this, and was completely 
enraptured by what I was seeing. 

Characters were flying across the 

screen, hurling knives and throwing 
stars at each other before prepping 
to pelt their opponents with a 
fireball. These attempts would, of 
course, be blocked by a huge wall 
of sand that was being manipulated 
by one of the ninjas. I was put into a 
trance watching the fighting unfold; 
it was the first time I had ever been 
immediately engaged in a television 
series. This first encounter with 
anime was the beginning of a 
long rabbit hole, ending with a 
diehard adolescent obsession. After 
“Naruto,” I then started watching 
more 
lighthearted 
shows 
like 

“Fruits Basket” and darker shows 
that would scare the hell out of me 
like “Higurashi no Naku Koro ni.” 

Soon enough, all of my favorite 

shows were finished with no plans 
for further seasons — but I wanted 
more. The search for more fulfilling 
anime content commenced, and 
surprisingly, I did not have to look 
far. I stumbled across a website 
called Fanfiction.net that was full 
of stories to be read, some of them 
acting as prequels to these TV series, 
some of them epilogues and some of 
them different stories entirely. 

It was on this website that I 

was introduced to an entirely 
new world of nerdy, oftentimes 
underrepresented people, writing 
stories in the worlds of some of my 
favorite books and shows. You had 
countless “Harry Potter” stories 
(633k of them), even stories about 
“Spongebob Squarepants” (2.1k). 
But, the one that really stuck with 
me was a story called “The Next 
Type Of Motion” which was a 
prequel to the “Naruto” series. I 
read it when I was about 12 years old 
and still trying on identities, seeing 
which fit best.

There are 80,679 words in that 

story, and I read every single one in a 
single night. It was 4 a.m. by the time 
I had stopped reading, exhausted 
but enthralled. The story was 
discontinued at Chapter 16, right 
when the two primary characters 
were sharing one of their first kisses. 
I couldn’t help but cry not because 
it was over, but because it felt like 
I was reading about myself on the 
page. Never before had I read a story 
featuring such a wholesome and 
passionate queer friendship-turned-
romance — it filled my young heart 
with hope that who I currently was, 
and who I was becoming, was okay.

It wasn’t until I brought my 

fanfiction devotion up at my 
elementary school that I realized 
my classmates did not feel the same. 
Furrowed brows were pointed 
in my direction at the mention of 
reading a fanfiction about an anime. 
My classmates would say things 
like, “That’s gross! Fanfiction is 
filled with porn and tentacles and 
pedos, I can’t believe you would read 

something like that.”

And, 
upon 
some 
personal 

research, I learned that my peers 
were not alone in these very harsh 
judgments against the medium.

In 2016, Vox journalist Constance 

Grady wrote an article called “Why 
We’re Terrified of Fanfiction”, 
speaking on some people’s distaste 
for fandom — an umbrella term 
encompassing all “cults” of people 
with 
self-proclaimed 
obsessions 

over TV shows, video games, etc. 
The article details fears of mob 
mentality and cults being formed 
around 
such 
niche 
topics 
as 

“Heaven’s Gate”. But there are other, 
more misogynistic reasons for 
fandom being so stigmatized.

Research suggests that shame 

surrounding fandom culture is 
gendered, with male-dominated 
fandoms like sports being widely 
accepted and female-dominated 
fandoms 
— 
think: 
boy 
band 

obsessions — facing more societal 
ridicule. While there have been 
efforts to create more equitable 
space in fandom for women, there 
is still resistance to it. Therefore, 
female-driven fandom is labeled as 
lesser, gross, futile.

For a while, I was convinced by 

my classmates’ disgust for fandom 
and turned away from fandom for 
fear of being bullied or perceived as 
“weird.” My interests throughout 
high school and the beginning of 
college were still weird, but less 
culturally ridiculed than fanfiction. 
I would watch “Adventure Time” 
with my friends, but I would not 
bring up the very niche anime that it 

reminded me of. 

It wasn’t until I got on TikTok in 

2020 that I was thrown back into 
the fantastical world of fandom — 
and it happened by chance. I was 
creating a series of TikToks that 
asked people to “make the comment 
section look like ___”. For example, 
I made one that was: “Make the 
comment section look like middle 
schoolers pretending to be drunk to 
their friends over text.” From what 
I could gauge, people really seemed 
to enjoy it. The video currently has 
471,100 views and 67,800 likes.

It was such a nice feeling to have 

a sense of community, even if it was 
for a brief, virtual moment. I kept 
making more of these videos, and 
decided to dive in and embrace my 
interest in fanfiction. If it flopped, it 
flopped, right? I made another Tik 
Tok that challenged my viewers to: 
“Make the comment section look 
like a Wattpad fanfiction.”

I thought the video was funny 

but I didn’t expect it to go viral. 
My phone started blowing up in 
my pocket and I couldn’t help 
but watch in awe as my followers 
went from one thousand, to four 
thousand, to ten thousand. It felt 
like every moment I wasn’t looking 
at my phone, I was missing out on 
hundreds of people reaching out to 
me via my comment section with 
funny quips and phrases. The feeling 
of being watched by thousands, 
sometimes 
even 
millions, 
of 

individuals is euphoric and thrilling. 
Swarms of comments mused at how 
resilient fanfiction authors were, 
and oftentimes how it inspired them 

to get back into writing.

In an instant, I felt like I was a 

child again, taking part in something 
bigger than myself. Something only 
fanfiction devotees could dream up.

Once I realized that a lot of people 

could relate to my fandom interests, 
my fanfiction videos exploded. I 
started making content about crazy 
author’s notes that writers would 
add into their stories, or strange 
stories written about Ben Shapiro. 
I was having a fun time, but more 
importantly, I was starting to see 
how many other people my age had 
been positively impacted by reading 
fanfiction. 

The little thoughts in my head 

about representation in the media 
were suddenly right in front of 
me, represented by thousands of 
other individuals on Tik Tok. It felt 
validating to know that there were so 
many others like me on the internet. 
Comments would flow in talking 
about how fanfiction helped people 
come out as asexual, transgender, 
pansexual. The commenters talked 
about how fanfictions about queer 
characters in the “Dr Who” universe 
helped them feel like they could be 
queer, too. Other accounts spoke 
about learning English through 
fanfiction, and feeling the freedom 
to write in a style that they wanted 
because of fanfiction. There is a 
whole thread on Fanfiction.net with 
people discussing how difficult but 
gratifying it is to be able to write as 
non-native English speakers. 

In that moment, all of the 

stigmatization I internalized as a 
child started to melt away because 

I 
agreed 
with 
the 
fanfiction 

community. Fanfiction contains the 
diversity in themes and characters 
that 
often 
what 
universities 

categorize as ‘actual’ literature does 
not.

I remember in my sophomore 

year I took my Upper Level Writing 
Requirement, and initially was very 
excited to start the class. Writing 
at that point had been a hobby, 
and this was an opportunity to 
get feedback on it in an intensive 
way. My enthusiasm was quickly 
extinguished 
when 
I 
received 

my paper back and discovered I 
had earned a C-. In office hours, 
I expressed my worry about this 
grade, and what I was met with was a 
critique that my paper was ‘childish.’ 
While this paper was not fanfiction, 
apparently the vocabulary and 
structure were reminiscent of it: 
According to my professor, I was 
an “amateur writer” who needed to 
make drastic changes to my style if I 
wanted to write “correct” academic 
papers.

Needless to say, I did not get good 

grades on future papers in that class 
thanks to my stubborn nature.

***

In January of 2022, I became 

mutuals with a creator named 
Berklie 
(@icaruspendragon 
on 

TikTok). Posting content from faking 
her death via fanfiction to being a 
master of the Omegaverse, Berklie’s 
content is hysterically awesome and 
incredibly informative.

Film photos:
An ode to the art or just 
for aesthetics?

I can’t seem to scroll through 

Instagram without seeing at least 
one digital remake of a film photo 
taken on a disposable camera. The 
distinctly grainy, slightly blue tint is 
a constant visual on my social media 
feeds. These photos’ popularity 
would seem to indicate that they are 
of a superior photographic caliber. 
But, in reality, they are by no means 
high-quality photos. Often in these 
photos, some subjects are washed 
out while others appear as shadows. 
The photos can be blurry; teeth can 
be discolored; eyes appear as red 
beads.

However, despite these intrinsic 

flaws, the recent trend in using 
disposable cameras doesn’t seem 
to be going anywhere — at least not 
anytime soon. They invoke a sense 
of nostalgia, letting us romanticize 
moments that happened mere days 
prior to the film’s development. 
They are a romanticization of a 
common 
photo-taking 
practice 

from earlier generations. 

For decades, people have publicly 

idealized “vintage” time periods, 
claiming that life was much simpler 
“way 
back 
when.” 
Disposable 

cameras and film photos are tangible 
extensions of this mindset. When 
we see film photos, we are reminded 
of those our parents showed us from 
their twenties: photos from college, 
weddings, vacations, baby showers. 

Film photos — which were 

previously necessities to document 
such momentous events — are now 
luxuries for us to capture our favorite 
fleeting moments, despite their 
relatively hefty monetary expense 
to users. The Fujifilm and Kodak 
disposable cameras, two of the most 
popular types, store 27 photos. And, 
with each picture taken, there is a 
set amount of money lost (about $22 
per camera and $0.50 to develop 
each shot). Despite the steep costs of 
film photography today, disposable 
film cameras were a cheap method 
of photo-taking throughout the late 
20th century. Alternatives such as 
digital 
point-and-shoot 
cameras 

were substantially more expensive.

With the rise of digital cameras, 

during the mid-1990s, people no 
longer needed to assign a price to 
each photograph they took. With a 
simple SD card, we were given access 
to a seemingly infinite number of 
potential photos. For the first time 
in the history of photography, there 
was no marginal cost associated 

with taking one more photo. Thus, 
photo-taking became a completely 
viable opportunity for the typical 
middle-class family looking to take 
photos to document their travels 
and holidays.

But, others believe that the 

change 
from 
film 
to 
digital 

indicated a degradation — or entire 
elimination — of the artistry behind 
photography. With digital cameras, 
there is no more impulse to savor 
each opportunity to take a photo nor 
a preoccupation with saving spots on 
your camera for potential shots. By 
rapidly clicking a button, someone 
can take the exact same picture of 
a sunset at slightly different angles. 
Without the feeling of finiteness, 
there is no motive to appreciate each 
opportunity to take a photo. 

So with the emergence of a social 

media fad featuring film photos, 
perhaps we like the limitation of 
film once again — the pressure to 
only take a limited number of photos 
—… or do we? 

Popular photo apps such as Dispo 

and Huji Cam attempt to satisfy 
our taste for film photography by 
mimicking its process. The apps 
enable users to take pictures on 
their cellphones, wait one day (as 
though the photos are actually 

developing) and receive digital 
photos that appear to have been 
taken on film. Though they look 
quite different from authentic film 
photos, the apps have thousands 
of reviews on the Apple App Store. 
Many of the positive reviews relate 
to the “vintage” feel of the photos, 
while many of the negative reviews 
pertain to bugs within the software. 
Most notable is people’s photos 
being deleted from the applications 
— an issue that doesn’t arise with the 
physical film photos.

Nevertheless, the apps are tapping 

into 
a 
thankful 
demographic, 

offering a cheaper alternative to 
disposable cameras while providing 
the same aesthetic as the original 
medium. Disposable camera users 
channel their will to wait despite 
their accessibility to other, instant 
options for photo-taking.

Just a few years ago, Fujifilm 

Instax cameras made a revival as 
modern Polaroid-esque cameras. 
In 2016, Fuji sold more than 3.5 
times as many Instax cameras as 
digital cameras. Evidently, there has 
been a trend moving toward analog 
photography.

However, the Instax buzz was 

quickly diminished following the 
uptake of disposable cameras. Thus, 

photography trends are constantly 
evolving, an evolution that is ever-
changing in medium and preference 
thanks to social media. Whatever 
photography trends occur outside 
of the digital sphere — such as that 
of the disposable film cameras — are 
still shaped by the digital world, in 
the form of social media. 

I think film and Polaroid photos 

derive their beauty from their 
physicality. People can hold these 
tangible photos, hang them up as 
decor or tuck them away as precious 
memories in their home’s sacred 
places. And, at face value, the photos’ 
physical component is the biggest 
difference between them and their 
digital counterparts. Yet people feel 
the need to digitize the physical 
photos and publicize them for their 
social media followers. In doing this, 
users seek to replicate the feelings 
of nostalgia and simplicity that we 
often associate with film photos and 
polaroids. 

Some say that disposable cameras 

enable them to spontaneously take 
pictures whenever they are out 
or with friends. But, practically 
speaking, 
isn’t 
it 
much 
more 

spontaneous to bring out your 
cellphone — something that is on you 
at all times — rather than bringing a 

clunky piece of plastic, rolling the 
film and then taking the photo?

Some also claim that they 

appreciate 
the 
anticipation 
of 

waiting for a photo. As Gen Zers, we 
have grown up in a digital world. At 
the click of a button we have access 
to the World Wide Web, enabling us 
to connect with whomever, research 
an infinite amount of topics and 
use virtually any software tool we 
want. Sometimes it is nice to take a 
step back and revel in the beauty of 
anticipation. 

With this I can’t help but lean into 

my cynicism and conclude that Gen 
Zers have taken to film photography 
not for wholesome purposes of 
“savoring the moment” or relishing 
in anticipation as our older relatives 
once did. Simply put: We are 
reverting to this medium simply for 
aesthetic purposes. It looks cool in 
real life and, even better, it looks cool 
on Instagram.

There 
is 
absolutely 
nothing 

wrong with taking photos just for 
the aesthetic. When we trivialize 
photography by labeling certain 
photos as art and others as silly 
social media posts, we are no

MACKENZIE HUBBARD

Statement Columnist

In my adult life, the only time I 

ever asked my parents for money 
was when I needed to buy a winter 
coat.

I was a freshman in college at the 

time, attending Emerson College, 
a private school in Boston. I’d lived 
in northern Michigan my whole 
life, and I was sick of all of it — the 
weather, the people, the idea of 
staying close to my family. So I got 
out. Ran as far away as I could. And 
that meant running halfway across 
the country to a school I knew I 
couldn’t pay for but chose to go to 
anyway.

I underestimated the biting cold 

of fall and winter on the East Coast.

Somehow I had gone all of high 

school and much of middle school 
without a winter coat. My reasoning 
was simple — the only time I needed 
one was to walk from my car into 
school. Besides, I had three younger 
sisters who were not nearly as 
practical nor frugal as me, insisting 
that they needed a new winter coat 
every year. So, I resigned myself to 
hand-me-down fabric coats from 
my aunts.

But then freshman year of college 

came around and suddenly I was 
walking upward of two miles a 
day in Massachusetts. I realized 
a flimsy fabric coat simply wasn’t 

going to cut it. I knew nor’easters 
were a big part of the coast’s 
meteorological makeup, and I knew 
I’d need something warmer to walk 
to class in if something like that 
happened.

And sure, half the people I knew 

were walking around in Michael 
Kors coats, or sporting a Tommy 
Hilfiger jacket, but those were 
the same people who lamented 
about how the financial aid at the 
school just wasn’t enough. They 
were the same people who already 
had student debt simply because a 
private school on an urban campus 
is 
exorbitantly 
expensive 
for 

anyone. There was an openness, 
and a sense of camaraderie, in that 
we all understood the price tag of 
the school was nothing to scoff at.

I sent my parents a text, the 

request for a new coat veiled 
through laments about how cold it 
was and how different East Coast 
winter was to “Michigan cold.” But 
they didn’t catch the hint. Or maybe 
they purposely ignored it. Either 
way, I finally came out and asked 
them if they could pay for a winter 
coat. I’d go to Primark — before I 
knew what a disastrous company it 
was — and get something for cheap. 
The Macy’s in Downtown Crossing 
was also having a sale. Or I’d find 
something discounted at Marshalls.

Their response was a resounding 

‘no.’

***

At Emerson, I worked in the 

registrar’s office. I knew the amount 
of money some of the students at 
that school were dealing with. But 
I also witnessed the pain firsthand 
when I had to file withdrawal 
forms from students explaining 
that they just couldn’t keep up with 
tuition. On average, private colleges 
can cost upward of $40,000 per 
academic year, while public schools 
can range from $10,000 for in-state 
students and $20,000 for out-of-
state students. Scholarships and 
financial aid could only go so far 
when a year of Emerson’s tuition 
alone was nearly as much as my 
father made in an entire year.

I transferred to the University 

of Michigan specifically for their 
financial aid program. I knew 
my parents wouldn’t help me pay 
for tuition and I needed a school 
I could pay for myself, or receive 
enough financial aid to survive 
off of. I figured that a school like 
the University would be different 
somehow. After all, I personally 
receive the “Go-Blue Guarantee” 
and know many other students 
who receive substantial financial 
assistance. 

I should feel like I belong, right?
I can’t pinpoint exactly when I 

noticed this subtle isolation, but 
it became more apparent after a 
conversation I had with a friend 

during my sophomore year. I 
described my feelings of impostor 
syndrome and how I feared that 
the University only accepted me 
because I filled a quota and not for 
my academic merit. I theorized that 
they need to accept some students 
from the lowest income bracket 
to show that they do, in fact, have 
a great financial aid system. They 
needed enough charity cases so 
that they could blast their “Free 
Tuition” ad on every Youtube and 
Facebook page, talking about how 
they give students opportunities 
they wouldn’t otherwise have.

My friend laughed and said to 

me, “Yeah, you’re probably right.”

Taken aback by the response, 

suddenly I was watching everything 
I did and said about my financial 
status around anyone. And, I was 
watching others. I watched my 
roommate buy a week’s worth of 
groceries on her mom’s credit card. 
I watched someone buy two pairs of 
Lululemon leggings without calling 
her parents before swiping their 
bank card. I watched a friend leave 
a tip at a restaurant with their dad’s 
money.

The markers of wealth are subtler 

in Ann Arbor than in Boston. I 
don’t regularly see people walking 
down the street in Gucci sweaters 
here, but I do see people sporting 
Canada Goose everywhere I turn. 
People don’t pop across the city for 

cannolis and genuine Italian coffee 
during their lunch break, but they 
get oat milk and cold foam and an 
extra shot of espresso in their daily 
Starbucks drinks.

And no one talks about financial 

aid.

When 
it’s 
the 
middle 
of 

December and I’m waiting for my 
next semester’s aid to be processed 
so I can pay rent, I don’t hear 
anyone else mention how their 
reimbursement checks are late. I 
realized, at some point, many U-M 
students were not paying their own 
rent, including most of my friends 
— their parents were. Meanwhile, 
I learned how to sign a lease by 
myself, remembering to pay rent on 
the first of every month. I hunted 
for and secured an apartment in 
the hellscape that is the Ann Arbor 
rental pool while my friends had 
parents who were willing to help 
them find housing and pay for it 
outright.

When I walk out of Ulrich’s 

in tears because of the amount 
textbooks put me back, most of 
my friends don’t empathize. Their 
parents had paid for all their books, 
while I was hoping I had enough 
leftover aid money to pay for mine. 

I worked 12 hours a week on top 

of classes and extracurriculars, 
learning that many of my friends 
had never worked a job in their life.

Here, the discrepancies are small 

and almost invisible. And I can’t 
help but think that’s on purpose.

***

Once, I found myself crying in 

the storage room of the office I 
work at because I couldn’t get more 
hours and, thus, couldn’t pay for 
grad school applications. Asking 
my parents for a penny wasn’t 
even a thought. My education has 
always been and will forever be my 
responsibility, on both a personal 
and financial level, because my 
family simply doesn’t have the 
resources to support me.

My dad crafts metal parts for a 

living. When I first started filling 
out undergraduate applications, 
there was a section concerning 
your parents’ professions. I was 17 
years old and I didn’t know what 
my father did when he went to 
work, other than that he made these 
mysterious parts. My mom said to 
write ‘machinist,’ so I did.

He has worked the same job 

his whole adult life. Neither he 
nor my mother went on to college, 
his pay supporting a family of six. 
Essentially, that puts us firmly 
within the poverty line. Like my 
grandparents before us. And their 
parents before them. Turtles all the 
way down, or whatever the phrase 
is.

Behind the packaging: 
Unraveling ‘cruelty free’

Content warning: Descriptions of 

animal abuse.

When I was in middle school, my 

favorite hangout spot was the skincare 

aisle of CVS. The perfect weekend 

destination was a one-to-two-hour 

trip with my best friend spent poring 

over rows of brightly colored face 

washes, acne creams and animal-

shaped face masks. As a 13-year-old 

with an ExtraCare card, I felt like 

royalty as I sauntered inside. It was 

my version of a candy store: an aisle-

long, gray-carpeted heaven under 

fluorescent lights. 

I was in an unfortunate stage of my 

skincare journey where I thought that 

if I just found the right beautifully-

packaged product, all my blemishes 

would disappear. This belief led me 

to switch skincare products about 

once a month, which did not end 

up helping. I had a brief and ill-

fated relationship with the classic 

Neutrogena Grapefruit Cleanser, as 

well as many other similar encounters 

with products that I initially had high 

hopes for. 

Years before, I had an obsession 

with Lip Smacker lip balms. I was 

mesmerized by the shiny packaging 

and delicious saccharine, slightly 

plastic-y taste of their Sprite- and 

Coca-Cola-flavored balms. And right 

before that, I recognized my older 

sister’s Baby Lips lip balm, with its 

label written in messy, neon font, as 

the epitome of coolness. 

Toward the end of middle school, 

however, I learned that some of 

the products I used were tested on 

animals and became aware of cruelty-

free products. After watching a 

slew of YouTube videos and Netflix 

documentaries about the horrors of 

animal testing, the nostalgic products 

of my childhood were now marked 

by the cruel treatment inflicted on 

animals before the products reached 

the shelves. 

In accordance with the Humane 

Society 
International’s 
definition, 

animal testing is the use of living 

animals 
for 
research 
purposes, 

which includes testing the safety of 

cosmetics. Methods of animal testing 

include long periods of physical 

restraint, force-feeding of chemicals 

to animals and dripping of corrosive 

chemicals into their eyes. These 

conditions and practices cause some 

animals to develop neurotic behaviors 

such as harming themselves or 

incessantly spinning in circles. Most 

animals are killed when they are done 

being used for experiments, and others 

are “re-used” for future experiments. 

I was horrified to learn this, 

especially as a consumer who was so 

enthralled by the bright and happy 

advertising that characterizes so 

many beauty brands. It contrasts so 

sharply from the realities of how the 

products are made. After learning 

about this cruelty, I made a pact with 

myself to stop buying cosmetics that 

were tested on animals.

I soon learned that, unfortunately, 

breaking down what is and isn’t 

“cruelty-free” yields a dizzying web of 

contradictions that makes it extremely 

difficult for consumers to know if 

what they are buying was actually 

tested on animals. Because there 

is no legal definition for the term, 

cosmetic companies’ use of the term is 

unrestricted. Brands take advantage of 

a linguistic loophole: a company may 

label a finished product as not tested 

on animals, but “rely on raw material 

suppliers or contract laboratories” to 

conduct the animal testing instead.

Attempting to shop cruelty-free is 

further complicated by the fact that 

some companies advertise as though 

they do not test on animals, but sell 

in countries where animal testing 

is required. Aveeno, for example, 

states on its website that “the fact is, 

AVEENO® doesn’t conduct animal 

testing of our cosmetic products 

anywhere in the world, except in the 

rare situation where governments or 

laws require it.” The “rare situation” 

described in this statement and in 

those of various other brands often 

refers to animal testing requirements 

in mainland China. With China 

making 
up 
the 
second-largest 

market for cosmetics, fragrances and 

personal-care products in the world,

Content Warning: mentions of racially 

motivated crimes against Asian people, 
sexual violence

Bright Sheng, a University of Michi-

gan School of Music, Theatre & Dance 
professor, temporarily stepped down 
from teaching after he played the 1965 
version of “Othello,” in which the actor 
Laurence Olivier wore Blackface, with-

out an advance content warning. While 
students expressed rightful concerns 
regarding Sheng’s normalization of rac-
ism in what they had perceived to be 
a safe space, outlets and spokespeople 
rushed to Sheng’s defense. They (as well 

as Sheng himself) cited his survival of 
the Chinese Cultural Revolution, com-
paring the wave of campus “cancel cul-
ture” to a decade-long sociopolitical 
movement that resulted in the deaths, 
suicides and everlasting trauma that 
haunts generations. This was not the 
first time the Cultural Revolution has 
been exploited by mainstream American 
media as of recent years. In a viral video 
from June 2021, Xi Van Fleet, a Chinese 
woman “who survived Maoist purges,” 
stands before a Virginia school board 

and dubs the introduction of anti-racist 
pedagogies (in her words, “Critical Race 
Theory”) as “the American version of the 
Chinese Cultural Revolution.” After her 
brief speech, the predominantly white 
hall bursts into cheers and applause. 

Fleet was later interviewed on “Tucker 
Carlson Tonight,” and the speech was 
propagated by conservative media and 
viewed by millions.

The Cultural Revolution was a failed 

movement launched to reassert Mao’s 
political control over the Chinese Com-
munist Party, which is vastly incompa-
rable to progressives’ attempts today to 
advocate for a more inclusive, accurate 
curriculum for American history. Nev-
ertheless, these comparisons reveal, 
more importantly, the inadequacies of a 
U.S./Euro-centric history and its deeply 
ingrained anti-China biases. In these 
rhetorics, Chinese suffering is trivial-
ized, tokenized and exploited to defend 
American 
exceptionalism. 
As 
Fleet 

opened up about her childhood in 1960s 
China, her voice relegated the spec-
tacle of violence and death to a distant, 
timeless “orient.” As scholar Yang Yang 
Cheng wrote in her column, The Griev-
ing and the Grievable, “The safety of 
distance maintains (the American audi-
ences’) innocence. When they feel genu-
ine sorrow or outrage for the (Chinese 
victims of political oppression), the emo-
tional response absolves them of further 
obligations or the need for self-reflec-
tion.” Gasping and pointing at these hor-
rific histories, white Americans bask in 
their own freedom and liberties while 
sitting on land stolen from Indigenous 
communities, cultivated by Black people. 

The propagation of sinophobia isn’t 

exclusive to conservative spaces. Many 
Americans fail to understand that sino-
phobia is not limited to blatantly racist 
remarks or acts of violence against East/
Southeast Asian Americans and Chinese 
people. More commonly, it manifests 
itself through a socially constructed 
ignorance about China and Chinese peo-
ple, reproduced by all segments of soci-
ety. 

The Page Act of 1875 prohibited 

immigrants from “China, Japan, or any 
Oriental country” from entering the 
United States for “immoral purposes.” 
This act targeted specifically Chinese 
women, who were widely profiled as 
“prostitutes” and considered “lewd and 
debauched.” Rhetorics that depict East 
and Southeast Asian women (or any 
woman who racially presents as “Chi-
nese”) as provocative yet submissive 
persisted through the 20th Century. 
As the United States established mili-
tary bases in South Korea, Vietnam, the 
Philippines, Japan (namely Okinawa) 
and other Asian countries, women from 
poverty-stricken and war-ridden fami-
lies were forced into sex work to serve 
the sexual needs of occupying American 
troops. U.S.-led military violence in Asia 
thus contributed to the fetishization and 
hypersexualization of East/Southeast 
Asian women within the United States, 
rendering their bodies subjects of white 
male gaze, sexual violence and mockery. 
The ways in which Asians in the United 
States are racialized are inseparable 
from American foreign policy, and dur-
ing a time when politicians are advocat-
ing for increasingly aggressive policies 
towards China, East/Southeast Asian 
Americans are targeted as a result of 
rhetoric that instigates violence.

Mainstream “liberal” media is also 

responsible for perpetuating the racial 
paranoia surrounding East/Southeast 
Asian Americans and Chinese people in 
the United States. Reporting on China 
is often over-politicized to serve a sino-
phobic political agenda, rather than 
depicting Chinese society in a nuanced 
manner. The coverage of the recent Bei-
jing 2022 Winter Olympics by Western 
media outlets exemplifies such preju-
diced reporting. Eileen Gu is a Chinese 
American athlete who has been called 

an ungrateful traitor to her country for 
representing China in the Winter Olym-
pics. Despite the at least 15 other Ameri-
can athletes who represented non-U.S. 
countries for the Winter Olympics, Gu 
was the only one who endured intense 
scrutiny for her decision. Tucker Carl-
son commented on Gu’s action, saying 
“young people do dumb things” and 
called for a “collective revulsion” of her 
choice to compete for China. The Econo-
mist published an article about Gu titled 
“Cold Warrior,” paired with a now-delet-
ed graphic of chopsticks lifting the skier 
into the air.

In addition, Western media has also 

rushed to draw attention away from the 
game and hyperfocus on political issues, 
specifically regarding the mass deten-
tion and cultural genocide of Uyghurs. 
While some activists expressed right-
ful concerns, most critics attempted to 
frame this issue of political repression as 
uniquely Chinese. Uyghur suffering thus 
becomes a spectacle for Americans to 
decry oppression in non-Western coun-
tries as they dismiss the human rights 
violations committed by the United 
States and its allies. Furthermore, those 
who call for political intervention by the 
United States must interrogate the sense 
of American exceptionalism that belies 
their demand. “The leader of the free 
world” is not free from its own problems 
— rather, Americans ought to ask them-
selves what they can do for the margin-
alized people in their own community 
before redirecting their unwanted sav-
iorism toward other parts of the globe. 
Supporting 
these 
media 
narratives 

contribute to anti-China biases (which 
extend beyond people of Chinese origin) 
that will ultimately harm East/South-
east Asian people in America. 

Growing up, I never really under-

stood how unorthodox my life was until 
my freshman year at the University of 
Michigan. To me, I had a pretty good life 
throughout my childhood. I was raised 
in a comfortable home with my parents 
and four siblings and I had an amazing 
group of friends. Most importantly, I 
excelled in school and I was often praised 
by my peers for being one of the most 
hardworking students in our grade. In 
my opinion, growing up was easy. But 
reflecting on my upbringing now, I real-
ize that the only reason it was so easy for 
me to exceed all academic expectations 
was because I grew up in a community 
where the bar was so low. I’ve also come 
to realize that my community growing up 
was and remains so far removed from the 
United States at large.

I grew up in the Eastern Sunrise 

Manor neighborhood of Las Vegas. Vegas 
natives call it the East Side. Among the 
entire Las Vegas valley, my side of town 
ranks the lowest in high school gradua-
tion rates and highest in dropout rates. 
Only 11% of people residing in the East 
Side have a Bachelor’s degree or higher. 
In addition to poor education, the East 
Side has a crime rate that is 191% higher 
than the national average, making it the 
most dangerous area in the Valley.

The East Side is demographically 

composed of mostly Black and Hispanic 
populations. In my high school, about 

three-fourths of the students were Black 
and/or Hispanic. Many students’ par-
ents only spoke Spanish, including mine, 
which made it infinitely easier for differ-
ent Hispanic families to form meaningful 
relationships with one another. Although 
the East Side wasn’t the safest or aca-
demically the best, the racially homoge-
nous communities made it easy for many 
families to see past the reality that their 
neighborhoods needed a lot of fixing.

Typically, when seniors graduate from 

my high school, they stay in Vegas and 
go to a community college or the Univer-
sity of Nevada, Las Vegas. If they want to 
leave home, most usually travel to North-
ern Nevada and go to the University of 
Nevada, Reno. In my senior year, only a 
handful of students went out of state. And 
when they did, it was mostly to neighbor-
ing states like Arizona or Utah. When I 
received my admission to the University 
of Michigan, everyone was so proud of 
me. Not only did people recognize that 
the University was quite prestigious, but 
much more deeply, it was a recognition of 
the fact that few, if any, had ever traveled 
so far away from home for college. My 
school’s seemingly underachieving aca-
demic status paired with my peers’ disin-
terest in leaving the community they had 
grown so fond of had rendered moving 
somewhere so far impractical. 

In my acceptance email, I was made 

aware that I would need to start my colle-
giate studies in the middle of the summer 
as a participant in the Comprehensive 
Studies Program (CSP). Though the sum-
mer of my senior year was cut short, I 

couldn’t wait to arrive in Ann Arbor and 
explore the new place I would call home 
for the next four years. After all, prior to 
the CSP summer program, I had never 
been to Ann Arbor, and my only impres-
sion of the city was derived from nights 
spent binging YouTube campus tours.

Though I was never really given an 

explicit reason as to why I was selected to 
participate in the CSP summer program, 
I could tell it was most likely due to my 
first-generation and low socioeconomic 
status, as well as my underperforming 
high school. Many of my peers in CSP 

also had similar experiences which only 
brought us closer through our shared 
struggles. Nonetheless, I met some of my 
closest friends through that summer pro-

gram and am forever grateful for having 
been selected as a participant.

As expected, Ann Arbor was extremely 

quiet during the summer and, to be hon-
est, I loved it. The empty campus allowed 
my newfound friends and me to explore 
Ann Arbor in all of its beauty. I would 
often find myself taking random walks 
throughout the summer semester trying 
to take in as much of the city as possible. 
We all expected that, come fall semes-
ter, what we knew as tranquil Ann Arbor 
would become a buzzing city full of stu-
dents rushing to classes.

After the CSP summer program ended 

and right before the fall term began, I was 
invited to attend a four-day welcome pro-
gram for Latinx students called ALMA 

in Brooklyn, Mich. During ALMA, I had 
the chance to meet and bond with Latinx 
peers with whom I was easily able to res-
onate. ALMA made me feel like I was still 
back home in East Las Vegas.

During ALMA, we were randomly 

placed into groups of 12 that we referred to 
as our familias. One night during ALMA, 
my familia and I sat in pitch darkness and 
told the stories of our rough upbringings. 
Though it was difficult for some of us to 
recall the memories in which we felt our 
lowest, we eventually bonded over the 
fact we were financially and academi-
cally disadvantaged compared to the rest 
of the nation. Regardless, we were all 
proud as hell of our Latinx heritage. We 
also heard from speakers who reminded 
us that Latinx people made up a minor-
ity of students on campus. In fact, in the 
United States, approximately one in five 
college students identifies as Latinx. 
This was entirely new to me. After all, 
I grew up in a predominantly Black and 
brown neighborhood, I participated in 
the CSP summer program that was full 
of students just like me and at ALMA, I 
was surrounded by solely Latinx students 
that reminded me so much of home.

As ALMA came to an end, my peers 

and I realized that it was finally time to 
make our way to Ann Arbor. We expected 
the campus to be roaring with exhilara-
tion as other students began to move into 
their dorms. What we failed to expect 
was how overwhelmingly white the Uni-
versity was.

When I came to college, I made it a 

point to bring along my digital cam-
era in hopes of creating my best work 
yet. I have been practicing photogra-
phy since the very beginning of high 
school and I have yet to find another 
artistic outlet that better amplifies my 
voice and speaks to my creative soul. 
After spending years in art classes, I 
fell in love with the process — fleshing 
out the story I wanted to tell, finding 
underground spots around Chicago to 
shoot, dressing my friends up to fit the 
narrative I was building and editing 
my photos in Photoshop and Light-
room after the shoot. There was noth-
ing better than watching a concept in 
my head come to fruition. I planned to 
carry this passion with me throughout 
college, but this plan was quickly shot 
down by the expectations of my course 
load. I felt as if I couldn’t do much 
of anything outside of schoolwork; 
the days seemed to blend into each 
other and life had felt so monotonous. 
Hours on the weekend that used to be 
dedicated to playing around with Pho-
toshop turned into more time spent 
scrolling through Canvas and sub-
mitting assignments for the fleeting 
gratification from a burst of confetti 

on my computer screen. I watched my 
trusty Canon Rebel T6 collect dust on 
my dad’s bookshelf, then later on the 
desk in my dorm room.

When summer came around, I 

brought my camera home, promising 
myself that I would carve out time to 
take more photos. My two jobs and 
familial obligations were the fingers 
crossed behind my back. I quickly got 
busy bouncing between a virtual fel-
lowship and working at my local mall. 
My mom once asked to see some of my 
recent work and to cover up my feel-
ings of inadequacy, I brushed her off, 
claiming that I was simply too busy 
to go through the process of coordi-
nating a photoshoot. The best I could 
show her were a few underexposed 
Polaroids and some snapshots I took 
for my friends’ Instagram profiles on 
my phone. My camera lens watched 
me as I continued to ignore its pres-
ence on my dresser throughout the 
summer. Was I too busy to go out and 
take pictures, or was it out of fear that 
I had lost my ability to create some-
thing great? The former proved to be 
true to an extent, but I couldn’t shake 
the feeling that I no longer had any 
inspiration to create anything new. 

It wasn’t until the very end of the 

Fall 2021 term that I realized how 
much I really missed photography. 
I got the chance to go out and take 

pictures of my friends on my cam-
era, and I was surprised to see that 
I had taken a few shots that I really 
liked. It surely wasn’t my best work to 
date, but after over a year away from 
my camera, it was a step in the right 
direction. Constantly having to grind 
through school work without any sort 
of creative outlet is greuling. Just as I 
was on the brink of burnout, I realized 
that I needed to find my way back to 
my favorite hobby. My mom had been 
right — I wasn’t going to ever have the 
time to take pictures unless I made it. 
This also meant I had to swallow my 
fears of creating mediocre art. Prog-
ress, especially in the arts, isn’t always 
linear. What was most important was 
that I would be doing an activity that 
I loved, which is something that I lost 
sight of for a while as I became bogged 
down by my school schedule. I had to 
pick up my camera again with con-
fidence and trust that the greatness 
would return in due time. 

By February, I was taking pictures 

again for SHEI Magazine. The very 
first shoot I did with them felt like a 
breath of fresh air. Holding the cam-
era was akin to an embrace from an 
old friend and hearing the sound of 
the shutter was like listening to a 
favorite song that I haven’t heard in 
years. I was finally reunited with my 
love for taking photos. We were able 

to shoot in a local grocery store, and it 
filled my heart to be able to once again 
do something that I love so much. I 
had a ball playing around with differ-
ent edits and overlays in Photoshop 
to figure out what I wanted to do for 
my final edits. It felt like a personal 
breakthrough. On top of this, I also 
recently picked up point-and-shoot 
film photography with a cheap cam-
era I bought at a flea market. Shoot-
ing on film can definitely be a risky 
game, but it serves as a quick alterna-
tive to carrying my bulky Canon Rebel 
around whenever I want to capture 
timeless moments with my friends. 
Between photoshoots for SHEI and 
my film camera, I now feel refreshed 
by my new outlets to do photography. 

Taking the time to do activities 

outside of academia has been the key 
to reducing my burnout. I feel less 
stressed by the often overwhelming 
amounts of schoolwork when I have 
the chance to distance myself from it 
and decompress. The college lifestyle 
is not a sustainable one; my weeks 
are defined by late nights, numer-
ous cans of Celsius and a poor eat-
ing schedule. It’s difficult to break 
these cycles when every week feels 
so monotonous. Photography is the 
wrench in this cycle that I forgot I 
needed. To me, there is no sound more 
satisfying than the shutter of my cam-

era. There’s something really special 
about capturing an experience in one 
frame. Photographs have the power 
to tell entire narratives between the 
four corners of a frame. I can take a 
picture of a scene, whether staged by 
myself or candidly taken in the city, 
and someone else can see that image 
and fill in the blanks. Pulling from 
their own experience, one can remem-
ber the feelings, know the smells and 
through that snapshot of life, a con-
nection is formed between the viewer 
and the subject. There are so many 
intricate factors that go into taking a 
quality photograph: angles, exposure, 
lighting and so on. Do I want a low or 
high angle? Is the lighting too bright? 
Too dim? Am I creating the mood that 
I want to convey to the viewer? These 
are all the details that I take into 
consideration whenever I’m doing a 
shoot. My artistic voice is evident in 
the way that I stylize my portraits 
with vibrant colors, natural lighting 
and striking angles. I then further 
enhance my pictures with a form of 
manipulation, whether it be through 
digital editing software or by hand. 
 

The photos I take have the ability to 
speak for me where words may fail. 
No matter where my academic life 
takes me, I owe it to myself to keep 
using photography to display the lens 
through which I see the world.

Finding my way back to my first love


Trigger 
warning: 
this 
article 

contains mentions of sexual assault
O

h yeah, I was at a frat last 
night” — a decently typical 
way to begin a story — “and 

some dude shoved his hand down 
my pants.”

“Some dude — what?” I whipped 

around to stare at my friend, eyes 
wide. I was horrified, but not all 
that surprised. 

“Yeah. Everyone was pretty 

drunk at the time, I was sober and 
just — the vibe was off. This dude 
started dancing with me and then 
he started to dance a little more… 
on me?” She posed it as a question. 
“So I, like, threw my elbow back 
but he just pulled me closer to him 
and put his hand down my jeans. It 
was gross.” 

I didn’t know how to react. I 

told her I was sorry she had to go 
through that and asked if she had 
reported the incident. She hadn’t, 

even though she was well aware 
of the Sexual Assault Prevention 
and Awareness Center’s resources 
(which you can find at the end of 
this article). 

The nonchalance with which 

she told me her story makes me 
question why it is that we all 
seem so desensitized to sexual 
assault and whether sexual assault 
prevention 
resources 
are 
as 

accessible as they claim to be for 
University of Michigan students. 

So I sat down with LSA senior 

Sophia Fortunato, the student 
co-coordinator of the Consent, 
Outreach 
and 
Relationship 

Education 
(CORE) 
team 
at 

SAPAC. She told me that SAPAC, 
within its four branches (CORE, 
Bystander 
Intervention 
and 

Community Engagement, Survivor 
Empowerment and Ally Support 
and Michigan Men) works on four 
separate levels. The intrapersonal 
level 
includes 
empowerment 

activities 
that 
encourage 
self 

love and continuing education. 
Interpersonal 
involves 
healthy 

relationship 
workshops 
and 

peer-to-peer 
communication. 

The cultural level deals with 
primary 
prevention 
education 

and bystander training. And last 
is institutional, involving campus-
wide policy and the University’s 
response to sexual assault. This 
is the one level Fortunato feels 
is lacking and her sentiment is 
echoed in the University’s history 
addressing sexual assault claims.

“You can’t really go about trying 

to end any ‘-ism’ or any oppression 
without taking (all four levels) into 
consideration,” she said, adding 
that SAPAC’s reach across these 
levels is what gives her hope. 

Then, with my friend’s story 

in 
mind, 
I 
asked 
Fortunato 

when students should reach out 
to SAPAC. She responded that 
“there is a lack of awareness 
regarding what SAPAC does and 
what resources are available,” but 
students are encouraged to reach 
out for “any personal concerns 
relating to sexual assault” including 
asking 
for 
advice, 
reporting 

sexual assault, learning about the 
volunteer programs or expressing 
concern for another person. 

Lack 
of 
awareness 
and 

consequences are just two pieces 
of the puzzle that is normalizing 
sexual assault culture on college 
campuses. The power dynamics 
allowed by “sexual geography,” a 
term coined by authors Jennifer S. 
Hirsch and Shamus Khan in their 
book Sexual Citizens referring to 
“places and spaces where people 
meet folks that they might be 
interested 
in 
romantically 
or 

sexually,” is another piece. One 
such example of normalization 
through sexual geography occurs 
at fraternity houses. Fortunato 
elaborates that at a fraternity 
“you are always stepping into — 
physically — a space controlled 
by (the) group of men (that live 
there). (And) that power dynamic 
and geography inherently creates 
implied norms about who is more 
entitled in that space and whose 
boundaries and consent aren’t as 
privileged.” 

But when it comes to changing 

rape and party culture on campus, 
the answer doesn’t seem as 
obvious. During our interview, 
Fortunato 
emphasized 
the 

timeline SAPAC works within, 
stating that “by the time students 
come to college, they have been 
socializing for 18-20 years of their 
life” already, meaning how one 
interacts is “pretty locked in by 
the time they arrive on campus.” 
Now I, too, am a victim of the “Tea 
Consent” video of our collective 
youth, which taught the rather 
complex concept of consent by a 
two-minute animation. Even as 
someone who has since pursued 
further education on the subject, 
I wonder how effective primary 
prevention education can really be 
at the college level.

Perhaps 
it’s 
less 
about 

informational 
handouts 
and 

the four Cs of consent that one 
may or may not remember once 
blackout drunk, and more about 
denormalizing the “college life” 
which 
perpetuates 
the 
non-

consensual behavior that plagues 
each and every campus. Or maybe 
prevention education must start 
at a far younger age, taking its 
place between Algebra 1 and Sex 
Ed. Or perhaps we must consider 
large scale policy change, forcing 
institutions to take responsibility 
for the profusion of sexual assault 
occurring under their watch, the 
disregard of which is now being 
brought to the forefront by Dr. 
Anderson’s victims and many other 
brave students who have shared 
their stories. Either way, it is clear 
that organizations such as SAPAC 
must be paired with campus 
reform in order to create real, 
lasting change in an ever-changing 
community such as the University 
of Michigan. 

So as we invite the newest class 

of Wolverines to the University 
this fall, let’s focus on welcoming 
them into a community that 
prioritizes the sexual agency of 
every individual.

W

ar precludes perfect 
solutions. It necessitates 
sacrificing 
the 

dream of mutual prosperity in the 
pursuit of bare survival. U.S. policy 
surrounding the attack on Ukraine 
needs to reflect this reality. Direct 
military intervention is seemingly 
off the table, as it should be. Even 
though we will not be sending 
troops to defend Kyiv, Ukrainian 
allies must still take swift and 
decisive action to decimate the 
Russian regime economically until 
a resolution is met, while also aiding 
those fleeing the conflict. 

Recently 
the 
Biden 

administration, 
under 
heavy 

pressure from Congress, moved 
to ban Russian oil imports. This 
was 
a 
well-needed 
sacrificial 

step for Americans, and one that 
cordons off a key part of Russia’s 
economy from the rest of the 
world. Unfortunately, European 
allies have failed to undertake 
the same sacrifice. NATO — the 
treaty group of Western countries 
initially bound together to stand 
up to Soviet influence in the 20th 
century — is most successful when 
it acts in unison. For Europe to lie 
back and let the U.S. take action, 
while avoiding taking similar steps, 
makes these moves less effective 
in combating Russian aggression. 
Not only that, it prolongs the 
conflict that will leave thousands of 
additional Ukrainians and Russians 
dead. 

A 
second 
action 
the 

administration should take, with 
congressional partnership, is to 
make a direct and forceful call 
on U.S. companies to suspend 
operations in Russia. A significant 
number of companies have already 
taken such action without federal 
support, but holdouts still exist 
— Hilton, Hyatt and Mars being 
among them. If this conflict is to end 
in a timely manner, companies must 
suspend operations, as opposed 
to ending them outright, with the 
condition that business operations 
in Russia will return at the 
conclusion of Russian aggression. 
This sets a concrete barometer, 
while clearly incentivizing Russian 
de-escalation. 
Likewise, 
the 

American 
government 
should 

put its full weight behind efforts 
to punish Russian oligarchs with 
assets in the U.S. and other Western 
countries.

As of March 8, over 2 million 

people have fled Ukraine, half of 
whom are reportedly children. 
About 25% of the aforementioned 
refugees have sought safety in 
neighboring countries such as 
Poland, but it is imperative that 
other European — such as Germany 
— countries pull their weight 
as well. While there has been 
outpouring support across Europe 
for Ukraine in the past 10 days, 
some worrying trends have come 
to light. Reports of people of color 
finding it significantly harder to 
escape Ukraine mirror the biased 
media coverage of the invasion 
as compared to similar situations 
in Africa and the Middle East. 
Intentional or not, the message 
coming out of Europe right now is 
that refugees are welcome, just not 
all of them.

Looking beyond the Atlantic, the 

more places there are for Ukrainians 
to seek refuge, the better, and 
the U.S., too, must play its part. 
However, there is an argument to 
be made that a more efficient use 
of U.S. resources would involve 
allocating resources to countries 
in Eastern Europe that are more 
appropriate hosts by virtue of 
their geography. This would allow 
Eastern European countries — such 
as Poland — to prepare for the surge 
of incoming Ukrainians, who would 
also benefit from a well-funded 
refugee program. 

While the short-term focus is 

and should be on aiding Ukrainian 
refugees, they are not the only 
people actively seeking to flee the 
current conflict. Reports suggested 
that almost 50% of the Russian 
population do not support Putin’s 
invasion of Ukraine, with the 
deteriorating economic situation 
one of many reasons for such 
displeasure. This offers the U.S. 
and the global community an 
opportunity to attract educated 
Russian individuals to immigrate to 
the U.S. or Europe. Not only would 
this further Russia’s shrinking 
population problem, it would be 
the sort of brain drain, an exodus 
of educated citizens, that weakens 
the powerhouses of the Russian 
economy, many of whom have 
played vital roles in strengthening 
Putin’s reign. While such an idea 
of 
weaponized 
emigration 
— 

using green cards and permanent 
residency statuses to lure educated 
urbanites out of Russia — will pay 
dividends in the long term, it will 
have the added short-term benefit 
of dismaying the Russian public, 
and hopefully bringing an end to 

the conflict sooner. 

On Feb. 22, 2022, German 

Chancellor Olaf Scholz declared a 
halt to the certification of the Nord 
Stream 2 pipeline, the second of 
two Baltic Sea natural gas pipelines 
from Russia to Germany. While the 
Russian state-operated company 
Gazprom maintains more than 50% 
of Nord Stream 1, created in 2011, 
Nord Stream 2 is owned entirely 
by Gazprom. Prior to the February 
invasion of Ukraine by Russia, the 
United States and the European 
Union expressed their concerns 
about Nord Stream 2 and German 
reliance on Russian energy. In 
response, the Chancellor defended 
the project out of “private-sector” 
interests, deterring attention from 
political impact in late 2021. 

In January, as concerns of 

invasion arose, the U.S. and EU 
released a joint statement declaring 
a move toward accessing natural 
gas from “diverse sources across the 
globe” to better protect European 
countries from supply shocks and 
reliance on Russia. As Western 
Europe’s economic powerhouse, 
Germany is not only in danger 
of creating a disunited EU front 
against Russia but also risking 
long-term economic strangulation 
in Ukraine. Major Soviet-era gas 
pipelines from Russia to Europe 
have long fed Ukraine transit fees, 
fees that Baltic undersea pipelines 
avoid paying. 

Without 
access 
to 
Russia’s 

steady supply of gas, Germany 
has legitimate fears about its 
energy independence. However, 
without a united front against the 
Russian 
government, 
sanctions 

may not be as effective or work as 
quickly. While Germany relies on 
Russia, Russia relies on Europe 
— about 70% of Russia’s natural 
gas exports go to Europe. In other 
European countries, like France 
and the Netherlands, reliance on 
Russian gas is far below the roughly 
40% of EU-wide dependence. In 
early 2022, France promised an 
expansion of its already substantial 
nuclear program, moving toward 
more sustainable and independent 
energy. Nuclear energy, a highly 
polarizing 
topic 
concerning 

cleaner 
energy 
and 
possible 

nuclear disasters (such as those in 
Chernobyl and Fukushima), has 
made France less reliant on Russia. 
On the other side of the energy 
argument, Germany promised in

n November of 2018, former 
U.S. 
Rep. 
Beto 
O’Rourke, 

D-Texas, ended his concession 

speech to Republican incumbent 
Senator Ted Cruz by exclaiming 
“I am so fucking proud of you 
guys.” Abrupt and unfiltered, this 
conclusion embodied the heart 
and soul of the O’Rourke Senate 
campaign.

O’Rourke’s efforts to win a seat 

in an elected position have not gone 
unnoticed by the media, or by the 
public. His usage of social media and 
community involvement are what 
have made him notable, and, while 
not successful at the ballot box, he 
has been successful in changing 
how campaigns are run.

In the last five years, O’Rourke 

has staged political runs as a man of 
grassroots ties — knocking on doors 
and speaking directly to the people 
he aims to represent. His 2018 
Senate run against Cruz, his 2020 
Democratic primary hopes and 
his current campaign against Gov. 
Greg Abbott hold this same core — 
the strategic message of “Powered 
by People.” In fact, these hands-on 
efforts did make a difference: the 
O’Rourke Senate campaign was an 
intensely close call, with only a 2.6% 
difference between O’Rourke and 
Cruz.

The other notable characteristic 

of the efforts of O’Rourke and 
multiple other Democrats is their 
shared goal. Young, fresh-faced 
politicians want a seat at the table 
because they want to make change 
and directly help their constituents, 
but, in recent election years, the true 
goal of hopeful Democrats seems to 
be voting Trumpism out of office.

The primary goal of Democrats 

in the 2016 election was to prevent 
Donald Trump — a new brand of 
conservative, a right wing populist 
— from becoming president. That 
hope was replicated in 2020, with 
the Democratic establishment again 
aiming to stop Trump from winning 
re-election. The general election 
was no different — Democrats 
fought hard to take back the Senate 
by defeating Republican officials 

particularly supportive of Trump.

Congressional Democrats and 

political hopefuls like O’Rourke find 
themselves split by ideology — with 
the progressive and moderate sides of 
the party continuously challenging 
one another on the party’s legislative 
agenda. Disagreement leads to lack 
of action, and in recent months the 
Democratic Party has been often 
described as ineffective in their 
efforts to enact substantive policy. 
Though not united ideologically, the 
Democrats continue to collectively 
oppose the Trump-wing of the 
Republican Party.

American voters have become 

more polarized in recent election 
cycles. Trump’s position in the 
political framework has intensified 
this division, and a focus on 
defeating him has made people 
defensive of their party, whether 
Democrat or Republican. People still 
vote based on issues of importance 
and who is best fit to serve their 
interests, 
but 
with 
campaigns 

becoming much more candidate-
centered, politicians — specifically 
Democrats — have made changes 
in their campaigning efforts. It has 
become less about who is the best 
candidate to serve their constituents 
or who may best achieve these policy 
goals and more about preventing 
other parties from taking control. 
This mindset actively works against 
the interests of those they are meant 
to represent. 

O’Rourke is making his third 

attempt in the past five years to 
represent the people of Texas. 
By 
effectively 
and 
personally 

communicating his goals with 
voters, O’Rourke, like many other 
Democratic 
candidates, 
comes 

across as well-acquainted with 
the role of public office and the 
importance of constituent service. 
But having tried and failed two 
times to defeat a Republican 
incumbent, ulterior motives may 
be detected: is this about service, or 
is it about preventing Republicans 
who share Trump’s ideology from 
holding office?

It is commendable to continue to 

run for public office after multiple 
defeats. But, at some point, candidate 
and party-based motives are not 
enough to run on, and they can, in 

many cases, do more harm than 
good. Being opposed to a certain 
candidate or party does not make 
a campaign popular, and repeated 
attempts to unseat Republicans 
— without any meaningful policy 
goal after they are defeated — are 
counter to a “progressive” agenda. 
O’Rourke’s close race in 2018 gave 
him the confidence to continue 
campaigning, but, over the years, 
it has become less about him 
being the best candidate for the 
people and more about defeating 
a Republican. In an era when 
intensified 
political 
and 
social 

issues have become central to the 
identity of people, voting a certain 
type of politician out of office is 
no longer reasonable: the act of 
voting a certain type of politician 
into office is most important. 
Democratic 
communications 

strategy, rightfully, mobilized to 
eject Donald Trump from office 
and combat his wrongdoings. But 
this 
communications 
strategy 

seems to be sorely inept at 
combating Republicans post Trump 
Presidency. 

Democrats are struggling to stay 

afloat with this philosophy in mind. 
With the midterm elections quickly 
approaching, they have to begin to 
rethink their strategy. Focusing on 
the past is counterproductive, and 
calling out former presidents on 
the campaign trail is not the call to 
action they think it is. There must 
be a concrete agenda for candidates 
to follow: an effective compromise 
between the more progressive 
and moderate wings of the party. 
The American people want direct 
aid from their representatives. 
They want constructive policy 
that makes their lives better — not 
speeches dedicated to discussing 
a politician who no longer holds 
public office.

“Voting Trumpism out of office” 

won’t work anymore; it won’t get 
constructive Democrats elected. 
Hopefuls such as O’Rourke must 
focus less on being the opposite 
of Trump and his allies and more 
on being a representative for their 
constituents. Elections may be 
about victory, but not for one’s self 
or party — for the constituents they 
represent. 

Campaigning against Trump won’t 

work for Democrats in 2022

T

he latest meeting of the 
Conservative Political 
Action 
Conference 

(CPAC) last month revealed 
that 
Republicans 
around 

the 
country 
continue 
to 

enthusiastically support former 
President Donald Trump. In 
a straw poll of hypothetical 
Republican candidates, nearly 
60% 
signaled 
they 
would 

back Trump in the rapidly-
approaching 2024 presidential 
election. Coming far behind 
in second place was Gov. Ron 
DeSantis, R-Fla., who secured 
just over a quarter of the tally.

With 
the 
Republican 

presidential 
primaries 
less 

than 
two 
years 
out, 
and 

campaigning likely to begin 
around a year before that, 
many signs point to Trump 
launching a bid for a second 
term in the White House. If 
strong levels of support for 
Trump 
among 
Republicans 

hold, it’s highly likely we’ll 
be witnessing another face-
off between Donald Trump 
and Joe Biden. Americans 
won’t 
cast 
their 
next 

presidential ballots for more 
than 30 months, but with a 
number of polls now putting 
Trump ahead of Biden in a 
hypothetical matchup, there’s 
a reasonable chance Trump 
could end up back in the Oval 
Office come January 2025.

When 
Trump 
departed 

the White House only two 
weeks after a group of his 
rioting 
supporters 
stormed 

the Capitol, the idea of Trump 
returning 
and 
mounting 

another 
run 
for 
president 

seemed wild and ridiculous. 
According to Quinnipiac polls 
taken in the final days of the 
Trump presidency, almost 60% 
of voters said Trump should be 
barred from holding any kind 
of elected office ever again, 
while 53% said Trump should 
resign from office before his 
term ended. 

Seven Republican senators 

voted to convict the former 
president 
in 
his 
second 

impeachment trial over the 
January 
6 
insurrection. 

Republican leaders like then-

Senate Majority Leader Mitch 
McConnell, R-Ky., were widely 
and publicly critical of Trump. 
Multiple 
loyal 
officials 
in 

the 
Trump 
administration, 

including 
Attorney 
General 

William 
Barr 
and 
the 

Secretaries of Education and 
Transportation, resigned.

But the picture is entirely 

different only a short year later. 
Too many Republicans seem to 
have turned a blind eye to the 
ugly final days of the Trump 
administration, 
threatening 

to destroy any conservative 
who stands against Trump. 
After Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., 
and Rep. Adam Kinzinger, 
R-Ill., joined a Congressional 
committee probing the events 
of 
January 
6, 
Republicans 

censured both representatives 
and 
declared 
the 
Capitol 

violence 
was 
“legitimate 

political discourse.” The GOP 
also removed Cheney from 
House Republican leadership 
last spring over her opposition 
to Trump. 

These recent trends within 

the GOP illuminate Trump’s 
extreme popularity within the 
party and the headwinds most 
mainstream Republicans face 
in opposing him. Republicans 
must change course quickly. 
It’s time for the GOP to reset, 
turn away from Trump and 
support 
candidates 
who 

reflect the values of not only 
the Republican Party but of 
America at large.

Not too long ago, Republicans 

threw their support behind 
presidential 
candidates 
like 

former Sen. John McCain, 
R-Ariz., 
a 
Vietnam 
War 

veteran 
who 
exemplified 

America’s democratic values 
and 
promoted 
conservative 

principles 
like 
smaller 

government 
and 
lower 

spending. 
Republicans 
like 

McCain 
had 
reasonable 

policy 
disagreements 
with 

Democrats, 
but 
they 
were 

always firm advocates of the 
American people, and were 
respected on both sides of the 
aisle.

President 
Trump 
surely 

had positive accomplishments 
during his term, like signing 
the First Step Act, a bipartisan 
initiative focusing on much-
needed criminal justice reform. 

But by and large, it’s become 
readily apparent that Trump 
lacks the qualities Americans 
need in their president. After 
he lost the election in 2020 
to 
Biden, 
Trump 
launched 

an unprecedented effort to 
discredit the election results 
and 
overturn 
the 
will 
of 

the people so he could stay 
in 
power. 
Those 
efforts 

thankfully failed, but if not 
for the loyal Americans who 
stood in Trump’s way, we 
could 
have 
experienced 
a 

serious constitutional crisis. 
Nevertheless, Trump’s election 
lies continue to persist to 
this day. A poll from last 
November found only a third of 
Republicans believe American 
elections are fair. Over 70% of 
Republicans said in a shocking 
December 
poll 
that 
they 

doubted the legitimacy of the 
2020 
presidential 
election. 

Trump’s election rhetoric is 
completely false as well as 
dangerous.

In the end, it’s astonishing 

that one of America’s two 
major political parties is so 
supportive of a figure who tried 
to subvert the Constitution 
and overturn fair, democratic 
processes. 
This 
country 
is 

built on democratic values that 
have guided it for hundreds of 
years. Russia’s blatant assault 
on freedom and democracy 
in Ukraine exhibits just how 
fragile democracy truly is, 
even in 2022. Trump’s attack 
on democracy here at home 
should drive every American 
— Republican, Democrat or 
independent 
— 
to 
support 

people up and down the ticket 
who believe in democracy and 
support 
it 
wholeheartedly, 

even when it’s not in their own 
political interest to do so.

With 
time 
running 
out 

before 2024, it’s imperative the 
GOP does a hard reset, and fast. 
Republicans must return to 
promoting American values and 
firmly reject misinformation 
and propaganda. Rather than 
vote for a candidate who has 
done 
much 
to 
undermine 

American 
democracy, 
it’s 

time 
Republicans 
throw 

their support behind people 
with proven track records of 
defending and celebrating our 
precious democracy.

A

merican intervention”: two 
words that represent a very 
loaded 
topic. 
Revisiting 

any part of our history shows that 
debate over intervention is present 
at every turn. From the beginning 
of our country’s history, President 
George 
Washington 
famously 

believed that the US should avoid 
any foreign entanglements. Then, 
during the 1800s into the 1900s, 
as the U.S. was strengthening its 
economic influence, it involved itself 
aggressively in other countries. After 
World War I, America adopted an 
isolationist policy for a time, but by 
World War II it had switched gears 
again to join the fight against the 
Axis powers. Throughout the 1900s, 
U.S. involvement in foreign affairs 
turned controversial with its fight 
against communism during the 
Cold War. Though the Korean War 
is considered a success as it stopped 
communism from taking root in the 
country, the Vietnam War is mostly 
viewed as a mistake. 

Such a complicated past in 

foreign policy has proven that when 
addressing this question, there is 
no easy answer. Now, as Russia 
continues its invasion of Ukraine, we 
are entering a new period of history 
that has raised the question once 
more. Yet, for me, the answer seems 
quite clear.

Throughout 
the 
centuries 

America has taken extreme steps 
to protect their economic exploits 
across the globe. Though it is 
clear that the U.S. is an economic 
powerhouse in our current global 
stage, its journey to get to the top 

wasn’t the most ethical. From 
overthrowing 
Hawaii’s 
Queen 

Liliuokalani when she wouldn’t 
succumb to U.S. economic desires, 
to leading several military coups 
against leaders — such as Guatemala’s 
democratically elected president — 
that were simply uncontrollable, the 
U.S. was everywhere. Considering 
the variety of ways America has 
influenced other countries’ affairs, 
often in a negative manner and for its 
own benefit, I have started to doubt 
the wisdom of intervention. I mean, 
why should one country be allowed 
to have that much power over the 
rest of the world? So for a very long 
time, I thought America should keep 
to itself instead of back-handedly 
controlling the world.

But recently, with the conflict 

between 
Russia 
and 
Ukraine 

steadily worsening, I have been 
forced to rethink. Specifically, I find 
myself thinking a lot about bullies. 
In school, if there is a child being 
bullied, I would consider it wrong for 
any bystanders who have the power 
to help the child in need to just stand 
idly by; some would even go as far 
to say that those bystanders are just 
as bad as the bully. And I can’t help 
but think of bullying when I think 
about our current global crisis. For 
those who may be unaware, though 
Russia recently invaded Ukraine, the 
tension between the two countries is 
one that has been building up since 
the fall of the Soviet Union. After 
the USSR fell, Ukraine became its 
own country, but Russian President 
Vladimir Putin never let go of his 
desire to rebuild the old Soviet Union 
empire; in his words, Ukrainians and 
Russians “were one people — a single 
whole.” 

That is why he has already 

invaded Ukraine once before, back 
in 2014, and annexed Crimea in the 
process. Experts think the reason he 
has chosen to continue his mission 
now is because of the strengthening 
relations between Ukraine and 
NATO. Though Ukraine will not 
be joining NATO anytime soon, it 
is working to gain admission into 
the European Union and is the 
fourth-largest recipient of U.S. 
military funding; in some ways it 
has become an informal member of 
NATO, which threatens Russia. As 
a result of his fears, Putin decided to 
invade Ukraine to take back what he 
believes is Russia’s rightful territory, 
and make sure NATO doesn’t inch 
closer. 

There is no doubt that this is an 

extremely complicated situation. But 
breaking it down to its core, the way I 
see it is that Russia is using its power 
to bully Ukraine and as a result, we 
are witnessing hundreds of innocent 
and unnecessary deaths. There are 
many debates going on pertaining 
to what the U.S. should do. The 
Biden administration has remained 
firm on keeping U.S. soldiers out 
of Ukraine, which is something 
the majority of Americans agree 
with. However, 83% of Americans 
have also said they favor increased 
economic sanctions against Russia. 
So people do think America should 
intervene, but are afraid of getting 
involved in yet another overseas war; 
and honestly, who can blame them? 
However, though I do understand 
people’s 
hesitation 
to 
escalate 

involvement in Ukraine, I believe 
that if all else fails, we might not have 
any other choice.

E

ach 
of 
the 
roughly 

50,000 students at the 
University of Michigan 

has their own story of how they 
became a Wolverine. Some of us 
were dressed in maize and blue 
practically from the moment we 
were born. Others discovered our 
love for Michigan on a campus 
visit led by a Michigan student tour 
guide. Some of us were the first 
in our families to receive higher 
education, beginning a brand new 
legacy. 

No matter what our pathway 

to becoming a Wolverine was, 
the moment we accepted our 
offers we accepted a list of various 
stereotypes. In general, university 
students are perceived as lazy, 
reckless and wealthy.

In addition to this general 

stereotype, 
every 
university 

seems to come with even more 
specific versions of these traits. In 
a study performed by researchers 
Andrea Abel and Amy Binder, 56 
Harvard University and Stanford 
University students were surveyed 
regarding their perceptions of 
other highly respected campuses 
such as The University of Chicago 
and Princeton University. They 
criticized the other universities as 
being too social, not social enough 
or 
overly 
career-minded 
and 

uptight. 

Abel 
and 
Binder 
reported 

that 
these 
micro-comparisons 

students draw between different 
universities are a result of the 
universities’ highly competitive 
nature. They report that this is 
largely due to working your whole 
life to be admitted to a selective 
university and then, once admitted, 
doing all you can to elevate your 
university’s status in order to 
bolster your own self-confidence. 

My two cents? Competition is 

ingrained in the system. To get to 
these top universities, students 
not only need an exceptional 
application, but also one that is 
better than that of their peers. 
This rigorous college admissions 
process has primed students to 
carry their overly competitive 
sentiments 
into 
their 
higher 

education endeavors. 

In Abel and Binder’s study, the 

University of Michigan was not 
mentioned by any of the surveyed 
students. However, it is fair to say 
that we have spun our own web of 
reputations, some ugly ones and 
some not so ugly ones. Many of 
these perceptions are fairly earned. 

Our 
competitive 
mentalities 

translate into the process of 
applying 
to 
the 
University’s 

selective clubs and rushing its 
professional fraternities. These 
actions could be considered feats 
of bravery, as they sometimes feel 
even more difficult than getting 

into the University itself.

Many of these clubs hold 

networking events where students 
who are already in the club can 
meet with those who are looking 
to join the club. Unfortunately, 
this can become a demeaning 
experience — existing members 
could flout their accomplishments 
in the club or speak down to 
nonmembers. 
Semester 
after 

semester, club after club, rejection 
after rejection, we begin to feel 
beaten down by the process. 
Despite our hopelessness, we 
continue to put ourselves through 
the endless stacks of applications. 
Sometimes, this draining process 
is less about the desire to join the 
organization and more about the 
idea that extracurriculars are 
necessary for success in the future.

Additionally, seeing our peers 

doing more than us — posting 
about 
their 
new 
internships, 

exclusive clubs or special programs 
— ultimately leads to constant 
comparison. Comparing ourselves 
to others, and feeling behind 
because of it, is very damaging 
to our mental health and self-
confidence. To cope with these 
damages, students ramp up their 
competition, creating an even more 
cutthroat environment. As you 
can see, this is a self-perpetuating 
cycle.

Heart of a Spartan, now a Wolverine: 

Joe Stewart’s unique opportunity

IAN PAYNE

Daily Sports Writer

JULIA SCHACHINGER/Daily 

Joseph Zain Rodger: 
Michigan’s pitchers 

need to step up

There is one divide that defines 

collegiate sports for many fans and 
athletes in the state of Michigan. 

The Michigan-Michigan State 

rivalry.

Allegiances are strong and pas-

sions run high. As a result, it’s not 
often that athletes cross the battle 
lines and transfer from one school 
to the other. But this season one 
player has taken this lightly traveled 
path, as the Michigan baseball team 
welcomes graduate outfielder, and 
Michigan State alum, Joe Stewart 
onto its roster as a graduate transfer 
student.

And he’s excited to have such a 

unique opportunity.

“I’m a Michigan kid, I grew 

up here,” Stewart said. “I have a 
unique opportunity that a lot of 
people don’t have, to get to play 
at both of the big universities in 
Michigan.”

This opportunity came as the 

result of an unexpected choice 
that many college baseball players 
find themselves facing.

In the wake of the COVID-19 

pandemic, Stewart was presented 
with an interesting possibility. 
Following the limiting of the 2020 
and 2021 baseball seasons due to 
COVID-19 concerns, the NCAA 
granted all active players an extra 
year of eligibility. The policy 
allowed many players to hang 
around the college scene and try 
exploring new horizons while 

continuing in the sport they love.

“I didn’t initially plan to play 

another season,” Stewart said. “I 
still enjoyed playing … I felt I still 
had something left in there.”

So 
Stewart 
exercised 
the 

option of entering the graduate 
transfer portal to play one more 
season, and Michigan coach Erik 
Bakich gave him a call.

“From talking to him and 

knowing some guys that have 
come through this program, (I 
knew) it was an awesome oppor-
tunity for me.” Stewart said.

And the Wolverine staff was 

thrilled to add Stewart to the ros-
ter.

Graduate 
transfers 

can be a valuable asset 
to a program due to 
their experience and 
outsiders’ perspective, 
which allows them to 
offer a fresh point of 
view. That insight can 
be useful.

“Being in the Big 

Ten, I know what this 
conference looks like 
and what it takes to 
be successful (here),” 
Stewart said. “I’m not 
necessarily 
as 
much 

the vocal leader, but 
(I’m) trying to show the 
younger guys, lead by 
example, do the right 
thing and what that 
looks like.”

Coach 
Bakich 
for 

one, appreciates having 
a player like Stewart to 

fill that role.

“I really like grad transfers,” 

Bakich 
said. 
“They’ve 
been 

instant leaders … experience wins 
at the college level, and they bring 
a lot to the table.”

While it used to be relatively 

difficult to line up grad trans-
fer students in college baseball, 
COVID-19 eligibility has made 
it fairly easy for Michigan to 
increase their number on its ros-
ter. The program has also pulled 
infielder Matt Frey and outfield-
er Alex Fedje-Johnson — both 
from Davidson College, whose 
head coach played under Bakich 
at Vanderbilt — out of the trans-

fer portal for this season to help 
enhance its lineup. 

“(Grad transfers) have a bit of 

a chip on their shoulder,” Bakich 
said. “They really have something 
to prove and want to be great.”

Being the most experienced 

members of the team, one of 
Bakich’s main goals for the gradu-
ate students are to impart both 
wisdom and the right attitude 
upon their new teammates, and 
Stewart seems to be the right man 
for the job.

In his senior season at Michi-

gan State, Stewart was named 
the team’s most improved player, 
and he has continued to display 

the work ethic and improvements 
that earned him that title.

“Joe Stewart comes to mind,” 

Bakich said when asked which 
players turned heads in preseason 
practices. “He’s probably the most 
improved player from when he 
first got here … he stands out, I 
think he’s got a chance to have a 
special year.”

Since then, Stewart has lived 

up to that praise with his perfor-
mance on the field.

In addition to leading the 

team by example off the field, he 
has achieved the results that his 
approach can yield. A fixture in 
the lineup, Stewart has hit the 

ball hard, and with 
discipline. He is also 
working 
to 
continue 

the defensive improve-
ments he saw last sea-
son in East Lansing, 
hoping to serve as a 
defensive rock in center 
field.

“On the field (I’ll) see 

what I can do to help out 
in the outfield,” Stew-
art said. “Continue to 
build on that defensive 
side of my game … and 
be a guy that can drive 
some balls into the gap 
… whatever I can do to 
get this team to be suc-
cessful.”

Stewart has been a 

large part of the Wol-
verines’ 
offensive 

explosion 
in 
recent 

weeks, and Stewart is 

enjoying this special chance from 
a whole new angle.

“There is much more appre-

ciation for still being able to 
play,” Stewart said. “I’ve gotten 
this revived chance this year to 
come over and help this team. … 
It’s been fun, I think I definitely 
appreciate the little things a lot 
more.”

Nevertheless, while he has 

been enjoying his time at Michi-
gan, he still hasn’t forgotten his 
old friends in East Lansing.

“That’s a game that will be 

circled on my calendar,” Stewart 
said. “(I have) a lot of friends over 
there. … It’s gonna be really fun to 
compete with those guys. … I’m 
looking forward to it.”

Stewart’s familiarity and good 

relationship with the Spartans 
will undoubtedly bring a fresh 
twist to the mid-April rivalry 
bouts between the two teams.

Stewart’s career in college 

baseball reflects the connec-
tions to both schools that many 
in Michigan possess. Just like his 
attitude towards baseball helps 
encourage his teammates to per-
form on the field, his attitude 
towards the rivalry also shows 
how these connections can often 
bring people together and offer 
the chance for new experiences. 

And Stewart is enthusiastic to 

experience it.

“Love Michigan State and all 

those guys,” Stewart said. “But it 
was awesome to get this oppor-
tunity to come here for my last 
year.”
Joe Stewart looks to lead the Michigan baseball team after playing for Michigan State.

Despite top tier hitting talent, 

the Michigan baseball team has 
not had the success they’ve hoped 
for.

Through the first 15 

games, the Wolverines are 
top 30 in the country in 
scoring and second in the 
Big Ten. However, they sit 
just one win above .500.

That means one thing — 

they can’t pitch.

Michigan can’t hold 

down a team for a full 
nine innings. The only 
game where the Wolver-
ines kept their opponent 
under four runs was an 8-2 vic-
tory against a sluggish 1-12 Seton 
Hall.

“We just haven’t played a com-

plete game yet,” Michigan coach 
Erik Bakich said. “You know, 
we’ve had some games where 
we scored a lot of runs, but we’ve 
also given up a lot of runs.”

It gets worse when you dive 

deeper into the pitching num-
bers. Among the seven arms 
who’ve seen the most innings, 
the average ERA is a woeful 5.35. 
Michigan is third to last in the 
Big Ten in walk frequency and 
fifth to last in hit frequency.

Letting that many men on 

base is not sustainable. It sets 
the team up for failure and late 
game collapses regularly, like 
those against No. 17 Texas Tech 

Michigan earns first No. 3 
seed in program history

MARK PATRICK

Daily Sports Writer

After losing four of its last six 

games, the Michigan women’s 
basketball team awaited the fate 
of potentially not hosting home 
games in the NCAA Tournament.

That fate was put to rest Sunday 

night, as the Wolverines earned a 
No. 3 seed — their highest seed in 
program history — in the Wich-
ita region. Being a top-four seed 
allows the team to host the first 
two rounds of the NCAA Tourna-
ment. 

“To be a three seed, that’s pretty 

awesome,” Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico said. “Being able 
to host and get another game at 
Crisler (Center) for our senior class 
that has meant (so much) to us is 
really special.” 

Michigan’s first game will be 

against No. 14 seed American on 
Saturday. If the Wolverines win, 
they will face either No. 6 BYU or 
No. 11 Villanova on Monday.

Fresh off winning the Patriot 

League tournament champion-
ship, the Eagles present a tough 
challenge. After starting the sea-
son 11-6, American has won 12 of 
its last 14 games. This is in large 
part due to its defense holding 
opponents to just 56 points per 

game — 33rd best in the nation. 
The team is led by senior guard 
Jade Edwards. The versatile 
guard does it all for the Eagles, 
leading the team in points, min-
utes, rebounds, steals and blocks. 

“They’re a great program, 

always successful in their league 
and have a really good coach,” 
Barnes Arico said. 

After starting the season 20-2, 

Michigan struggled down the 
stretch. It went out in the first 
round of the Big Ten tournament 
to Nebraska, losing 76-73, mak-
ing its seeding more precarious. 
After the Wolverines were up 
six with five minutes left in the 
game, the Cornhuskers ended 
the game on a 9-2 run, crushing 
their hopes of a Big Ten tourna-
ment championship. 

The No. 3 seed has much to do 

with the Wolverines early sea-
son success. The team started 
the season 7-0 for the second 
straight year. After losing to the 
Cornhuskers 79-58, Michigan 
compiled an eight-game win 
streak with wins coming against 
Ohio State, Iowa, Indiana, and 
Maryland. The team was par-
ticularly successful at home fin-
ishing the year 12-0 at the Crisler 
Center.

“We’re undefeated at home 

this year and I think that’s in 

large part due to our fan base 
and the support that we’ve got-
ten throughout the course of the 
season,” Barnes Arico said. 

Looking to win its first regu-

lar season Big Ten championship 
for the first time in program his-
tory, things began to turn for the 
worse. A combination of injuries 
and inconsistencies on offense 
and defense led the Wolverines 
to losses in four of their last six 
games. It’s possible they would 
have had a No. 1 or No. 2 seed if 
not for the late season sputter. 

Michigan has an opportunity 

to make program history in the 
NCAA Tournament. After being 
so close to capturing a regular 
season Big Ten title and losing 
in the first round of the Big Ten 
Tournament, 
the 
Wolverines 

look to advance past the Sweet 
Sixteen for the first time in pro-
gram history.

“(We’re) just really embracing 

this moment and being excited 
because there’s no guarantees,” 
Barnes Arico said. “So just have 
an appreciation for being able to 
still be competing, when so many 
other people are going home at 
this point, and so many people 
are disappointed, but really put 
themselves in a position to con-
tinue to play.”

and Florida Atlantic. Both games 
ended in multiple-run bottom-
of-the-ninth comebacks.

All of the mistakes 

came to a head in the 
Wolverines’ latest game 
— their 13-1 loss against 
Louisville. 
The 
Car-

dinals’ 
bats 
punished 

Michigan’s pitchers all 
game, and they were 
only held scoreless for 
one inning.

The 
Wolverines’ 

pitchers cost them more 
than just at the plate. 
Michigan has an average 

fielding unit that sits sixth in the 
conference in fielding percent-
age, but many of the mistakes 
they make are connected to the 
pitching.

“If you’re walking a lot of peo-

ple, the defense is going to be on 
their heels because they’re not as 
actively engaged,” Bakich said. 
“… So I think that the trust and 
the reliability of both sides there 
just needs to sync up and have a 
great synergy.”

The main fielding woes came 

in Greenville against East Caro-
lina. The defense held up for 
most of the game, but the two-
run loss was caused by two big 
rallies, both of which had their 
momentum heavily aided by 
errors.

This defensive start is not

ZAIN 

RODGER

optimal, but it’s far too early to 
discount the Wolverines from a 
deep postseason run. The Wol-
verines have the fourth hardest 
strength of schedule in the Big 
Ten. Bakich wants the team to 
face adversity early so they can 
be prepared for tougher battles.

“We’ve been here before. 

Every year when we sched-
ule really tough competition it 
seems to be a little bit of a back 
and forth and up and down,” 
Bakich said. “We’re scheduling 
teams that are all going to be in 
the postseason.”

It’s still a very young season. 

Once the home games and Big 
Ten series finally start, it’s very 
possible that the team starts to 
roll if they fix their mistakes.

That’s a very big if. 
If the season ended today, 

Michigan’s pitching staff would 
have its worst combined ERA in 
over 10 years.

“It’s one thing to talk about 

achieving your goals week to 
week, it’s another thing to do it,” 
said Bakich. “The bottom line is 
we just need to play better.”

Just like the teams they’ve 

scheduled to start the year, the 
Wolverines 
have 
postseason 

dreams of their own. If they 
want to compete, the pitching 
staff needs to figure it out.

If not, they’re in for a harsh 

wake-up call.

A

t 6:13 p.m. on Sunday 
night, 
the 
Michigan 

men’s basketball team 

could 
finally 
breathe. 
After 

weeks of speculation and missed 
opportunities to punch their own 
ticket, the Wolverines made it out of 
the bubble and into the bracket. 

“I definitely was nervous, I’m not 

gonna lie,” graduate guard DeVante’ 
Jones said. “I feel like we let a lot of 

games slip, so I didn’t know how 
the people that were actually 
making the brackets, I didn’t 
know how they would perceive 
us.”

With an 11 seed, Michigan coach 

Juwan Howard and his team have 
narrowly avoided the embarrassment 
of being the first Michigan team 
since 2015 to not make the NCAA 
Tournament. But, this sense of relief 
comes with a caveat: This story has 
already been written. 

Yes, the Wolverines will play 

No. 6-seed Colorado State on 

Thursday. They might 

face No. 3-seed Tennessee or No. 
14-seed Longwood in the second 
round. But — pending an act of God 
— this team’s legacy won’t be what 
happens in March. In all likelihood, 
its most defining moments are already 
behind it. 

Thirty years down the line, 

Michigan fans might remember 
this as the year the Wolverines were 
a preseason top 10 team and then 
started the season 7-7. The year they 
could barely squeak out wins against 
unranked opponents like Tarleton 
State and Buffalo. Or as the year 
Howard socked some guy in the head. 

The ones with better memories 

might recall Michigan blowing a 
17-point lead against Indiana to 
send them home from the Big Ten 
Tournament in just the second round. 
Personally, I know I’ll remember 
when sophomore center Hunter 
Dickinson had to sit out with a tummy 
ache. 

Of 
course, 
there’s 
the 
slim 

possibility that the Wolverines will 
turn it all around in the 11th hour, go 
all the way and become the Cinderella 
story of the decade. If that happens, 
every loss and poor performance will 
be cast in a new light. This team won’t 
be looked at as one that failed to meet 
expectations, never able to capitalize 
on the talent that — on paper — should 
have led them to the Final Four. 
Instead, it’ll be a team that bided its 
time, finding its groove when it

questions still remain

needed to the most. 

But that’s just the trope of a cheesy 

movie. As others have pointed out, 
the time for a cinematic, zero-to-hero 
plot line is long behind us. Coaches 
and players alike have been saying 
that they’ll use their losses to learn 
and grow for months, yet the same 
mistakes pop up week after week. 

Still, when asked what makes the 

team feels confident that they can go 
on a run in the Tournament, Jones 
repeated a similar refrain: 

“This is the opportunity we 

always talk about, especially after 
the loss to Indiana,” he said. “… After 
that, we’ve been saying that all we 
need is a chance. All we need in an 
opportunity.” 

It’s hard to make the argument 

that the Wolverines have lacked 
opportunities thus far. Instead, it’s 
much easier to find examples of when 
they’ve squandered them. There have 
been instances where it’s looked like 
Michigan is finally starting to right 
the ship, but then, after a one or two 
game stretch, its flaws come racing 
back. 

“It’s a new season now, this is the 

postseason,” Howard said. 

Maybe Howard is right and this is 

a new season, an entirely new team 
from the one that got trounced by 
Indiana on Thursday. Or — more likely 
— we’re starting a new chapter in the 
same story. Maybe the inconsistencies 
that have plagued the Wolverines will 
still be there on Thursday, and this 
year will end in the same way it began: 

With dashed hopes and unmet 

expectations.
