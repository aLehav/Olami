In the first major election since the passage 

of Proposal 3, which allows same-day voter 
registration, hundreds waited in line for 
upwards of two hours to cast their ballot in 
Tuesday’s presidential primary.

City Hall was the only location in Ann 

Arbor where people could change their voting 
registrations. Those who register at City Hall 
were allowed to vote there as well, whether or 
not it was their designated polling location. 

Residents first became eligible for same-

day registration when Proposal 3 passed in 
2018. Prop. 3, in an effort to increase voter 

turnout and accessibility, included provisions 
for automatic voter registration and no-excuse 
absentee voting.

Engineering sophomore Ranadeep Mitra 

waited in line for two and a half hours, and 
though he said it was a “pain,” he’s glad he voted. 

“I feel like it’s my civic duty,” Mitra said. “I 

honestly probably wouldn’t have voted if I had 
known it would take this long, but by the time 
I had gotten halfway through, I decided just to 
stay because I had already wasted so much time 
here.”

JOE
BIDEN
WINS

MICHIGAN DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY

STUDENTS FACE LONG WAITS

VOTING

SARAH PAYNE | Daily Staff Reporter

F 

ormer VP Joe Biden 
won the Michigan 
primary 
by 
more 

than 10 percentage points over 
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt, on 
Tuesday. 

Multiple sources called the 

race at about 9 p.m. with 32 
percent of precincts reporting. 
Biden’s 
win 
in 
Michigan 

follows a near sweep of Super 
Tuesday states last week.

The former Vice President 

spoke in Pennsylvania after 
winning Michigan, Missouri 

and Mississippi.

“To all of those who have 

been counted out, left behind; 
this is your campaign,” Biden 
said. “We need you, we want 
you, and there’s a place in our 
campaign for each of you. And 
I want to thank Bernie Sanders 
and his supporters.

We share a common goal 

and together we will defeat 
Donald Trump, we will do it 
together.”

The 2020 Democratic primaries, which 

started off with 28 candidates, narrowed down 
to two major contenders – former Vice President 
Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., with 
Biden winning the Michigan primary on 
Tuesday. Money in politics has played a divisive 
role in the election, with candidates differing in 
their methods for raising money. 

Grassroots campaigns such as Sanders’s 

garnered an average donation of $18.53, while 
other candidates such as Tom Steyer and 
Michael Bloomberg relied on their personal 
wealth to catapult them onto the national stage. 

When comparing all campaign donations from 

across the state of Michigan, Ann Arbor was the 
city that donated the most money to presidential 
campaigns, according to the Federal Election 
Commission. In total, Ann Arbor donated 
$480,943 in 2019, with each donation averaging 
$63.66. That’s more than two times as many 

donations as Grand Rapids, the second-highest 
donating city in the state, whose donations 
equaled $245,181. The city with the third most 
donations was Detroit, with $183,974. All of 
these figures were recorded from July 1, 2018 to 
Dec. 31, 2019. 

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., received 

the most money from University of Michigan 
employees, raising $30,854. Following closely 
in second and third place for most contributions 
was 
Sanders, 
raising 
$28,357, 
and 
tech 

entrepreneur Andrew Yang, raising $25,090.

The considerable amount of money Warren 

raised prior to her departure from the race 
last week is consistent with polls that showed 
the candidate in first place standing among 
white college-educated graduates. Warren also 
received the most donations from Democrats 
who have advanced degrees.

ASHA LEWIS/Daily

Two cases of the novel coronavirus 

and COVID-19 disease have been 
diagnosed in Michigan. 

Michigan 
Governor 
Gretchen 

Whitmer declared a state of emergency 
on Tuesday night.

Whitmer discussed the cases at 

a press conference with Joneigh S. 
Khaldun, Michigan’s chief medical 
executive and chief deputy director 
for health at the Michigan Department 
of 
Health 
and 
Human 
Services, 

and Capt. Emmitt McGowan of the 
MSP Emergency Management and 
Homeland Security Division. 

“I’ve signed an executive order 

declaring a state of emergency in order 
to maximize our efforts and assist 
local government and officials to 
slow the spread.” Whitmer said. “It’s 
crucial that Michiganders continue to 
take preventative measures.”

One case is a woman in Oakland 

County with a history of international 
travel, while the other is a man in 
Wayne County who had traveled 
domestically. Both individuals are 
middle aged and both are hospitalized.

Specimens from both patients were 

collected and sent to the MDHHS 
Bureau of Laboratories, where they 
tested 
positive 
for 
coronavirus 

and were sent to the Center for 
Disease Control and Prevention for 
verification. 

To prevent the spread of the virus, 

Whitmer said people should wash 
their hands for 20 seconds, replace 
handshakes with elbow bumps and 
cover their mouths when they cough 
or sneeze.

“It has moved into Michigan and 

I urge all Michiganders to take these 
recommendations 
very 
seriously,” 

Whitmer said.

Khaldun said the state government 

will 
continue 
to 
monitor 
the 

situation and warned people that the 
coronavirus is likely to spread across 
Michigan. Hundreds of people in the 
state are currently being monitored for 
the coronavirus. 

“It is very likely that we will see 

more cases and that there will be 
community spread,” Khaldun said. 

Khaldun 
urged 
all 
Michigan 

businesses and schools to develop 
plans to slow the spread of the disease 
and protect the community.

“All 
business, 
employers, 

hospitals 
and 
schools 
and 

universities should be making plans 
and appropriately preparing for 
this disease,” Khaldun said. “We’ve 
been working very closely with our 
partners across the state for several 
weeks on these preparations.”

At least eight states including 

Washington, 
California 
and 

New York are declaring states of 
emergency in response to local 
outbreaks. 

When asked if schools across 

the state would be closed down, 
Whitmer said no decisions had been 
reached yet. Several dozen colleges 
across the country have canceled 
in-person classes in response to the 
virus, including Harvard University 
and Ohio State University. 

A petition circulated on Tuesday 

calling 
on 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan to follow suit. As of 11 p.m. 
on Tuesday, the petition has nearly 
4,000 signatures. 

“Why are we being reactive 

instead of proactive?” the petition 
reads. “We should not wait for the 
first confirmed case of 2019-nCoV 
in Ann Arbor to take action. That’s 
the kind of mistake that’s put many 
areas in a dire state. This is a plea for 
the University of Michigan to move 
classes online now.”

The University’s Office of Public 

Affairs did not respond immediately 
to request for comment.

In an email to students on 

Tuesday, the Center for Global and 
Intercultural Study’s senior health 
and safety adviser Rachel Reuter 
said there is a “strong possibility” 
that CGIS will cancel its spring and 
summer study abroad programs 

due to concerns over coronavirus. 
University of Michigan officials will 
decide whether to cut the programs 
by the end of the week, according to 
the email.

Reuter noted the spread of the 

virus to more than 100 countries 
and the rapid increase in the 
number of cases.

“As a result many countries, 

including the US, are considering 
or 
have 
already 
implemented 

responses that include restrictions 
on mobility, cancellation of public 
events and the temporary closure 
of educational institutions to help 
slow the spread of the virus,” Reuter 
wrote. “As a result of the rapidly 
evolving situation, officials from 
across the University of Michigan 
are meeting to determine whether 
or not to cancel spring/summer 
study abroad programs, and we 
fully expect to provide you with a 
decision by the end of this week at 
the very latest.”

CGIS offers more than 140 

programs in over 50 countries and 
allows participants to fulfill degree 
and language requirements while 
studying abroad. 

The continued spread of the virus 

has led to a series of cancelations and 
restrictions of University programs 
abroad for countries with a Level 
3 Travel Health Notice from the 
Centers for Disease Control, which 
urges avoidance of all nonessential 
travel. In January, the University 
issued a travel restriction for China, 
discontinuing University-affiliated 
travel to the country and only 
allowing graduate students to travel 
with an approved safety plan. The 
school followed up with a travel 
restriction for South Korea in late 
February, expanding to include Iran 
and Italy. 

In an email sent to LSA students 

on March 8, LSA Dean Anne 
Curzan noted the disruption caused 
by the travel restrictions.

“Winter study abroad programs 

in countries with a CDC Level 3 
Notice have been canceled, and 
we will be working with affected 
students 
to 
try 
and 
arrange 

completion of coursework through 
alternative means,” Curzan wrote. 
“We will continue monitoring 
the situation so that we can make 
appropriate 
arrangements 
if 

additional countries rise to CDC 
Level 3. We will send out updates 
as soon as possible about spring/
summer study abroad programs.”

Reuter also warned students to 

refrain from buying airline tickets.

“I know how difficult and 

frustrating this is, but given the 
gravity of the situation regarding 
COVID-19 and our dedication to 
providing students with a healthy, 
safe and academically enriching 
study 
abroad 
experience, 
the 

University needs this time to gather 
relevant information and consider 
many factors in order to make as 
judicious a decision as possible,” 
Reuter wrote.

Students have struggled to adjust 

their plans in response to the travel 
restrictions.

LSA sophomore Hanna Smith 

was signed up for the Spanish 230 
program in Granada, Spain — which 
allows students to complete their 
final two required semesters of the 
LSA foreign language requirement 
— but now the fate of this program 
is uncertain. Smith said while 
she understands the need to take 
precautions, she needs the credits 
from the program.

“It 
would 
be 
unfortunate 

because myself and a lot of 
people have to fulfill a language 
requirement, besides the fact that 

it would be an amazing experience 
to be able to go,” Smith said. “But 
also I do recognize the severity of 
the situation and while it is really 
unfortunate that I might not be 
able to go, I understand it’s more 
important to take precautions.”

LSA junior Rayna Shamah was 

planning on studying abroad in 
Costa Rica during the upcoming 
spring term and Turks and Caicos 
for summer term to complete 
the language and natural science 
requirements. Shamah, who said 
she also planned to graduate a 
semester early in order to save on 
tuition costs, now doubts that she 
will be able to graduate early due to 
the CGIS cancellations.

“If the programs were canceled 

I would definitely not be able to 
graduate early, because I would 
need those 12 credits to graduate,” 
Shamah said. “I was extremely 
disappointed. I think the main 
reason is just because it’s kind of 
early. I know the University wants 
to take care of its students, that’s the 
main priority, but we don’t know 
anything about the virus, if it’s a 
seasonal virus. It’s just really early.”

Shamah said she hoped the 

programs would not be canceled 
but also said she understood the 
precautions the University is taking. 

“They’re once in a lifetime 

experiences,” Shamah said. “We’re 
not going to be able to live with a 
host family again, especially during 
college.”

This Week in History 

March 11, 1965: University officials announce plans 
for closure of admissions gate for freshman applicants

University of Michigan 

officials 
announced 

yesterday 
they 
are 

no 
longer 
accepting 

freshmen for next fall. 
A 32 percent increase in 
freshman 
applications 

over 
last 
year 
caused 

the earliest closure of 
admissions in University 
history.

Approximately 
12,300 

high 
school 
seniors 

applied to the University 
for admission next fall. 
Officials expect the total 
number of applications 
to exceed 13,000. Despite 
an increase of 20 to 25 
percent in the number of 
state high school seniors, 
the University received 
an 
additional 
increase 

of only 10 per over last 
year in the number of 
applicants.

The 
University 
is 

increasing 
next 
year’s 

freshman 
class 
by 

600 above the number 
admitted for the last fall 
term. The freshman class 
for next year will total 
4,800, 
an 
increase 
of 

approximately 1400 over 
two years ago.

The 
enrollment 
will 

total 
approximately 

30,900, as disclosed by 

the Office of Academic 
Affairs in December. The 
out-of-state students will 
number about the same 
percent of the student 
body as last year.

The 
effect 
of 
the 

additional 600 students 
on 
classroom 
and 

laboratory crowding, as 
well as on the hiring of 
new faculty for next fall, 
depends on the budget 

still undetermined by the 
state legislature.

An 
increase 
in 
the 

freshman class of 600 and 
the subsequent increase 
in 
applications 
was 

anticipated last fall by the 
admissions office, Bryon 
L. Groesbeck, assistant 
director of admissions, 
said. The added increase 
in applications caused the 
closing of admissions at 

this time.

The 
increase 
in 
the 

number of applications 
from Michigan residents 
and out-of-state students 
has been about equal.

All qualified Michigan 

residents who applied to 
the University before Feb. 
1, have been admitted. 
Those who apply now are 
being placed on a waiting 
list.

Michigan has 125 delegates, the 

largest number of all states voting 
Tuesday, which includes Missouri, 
Mississippi, North Dakota, Idaho 
and Washington and will be divided 
proportionally between Biden and 
Sanders. The former Vice President 
was also declared the winner of 
both the Mississippi and Missouri 
primaries early Tuesday evening. 
To win the Democratic nomination, 
a candidate needs at least 1,991 of 
the 3,979 pledged delegates.

Following Super Tuesday, a large 

number of endorsements from 
Michigan political figures endorsed 
Biden, including Gov. Gretchen 
Whitmer, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist 
and Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan.

Players on the national stage 

once included Sen. Kamala Harris, 
D-Calif., Sen. Amy Klobuchar, 
D-Minn., former New York City 
Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and 
former South Bend Mayor Pete 
Buttigieg. All suspended their 
presidential 
campaigns 
and 

endorsed 
Biden. 
Shortly 
after 

CNN declared Biden the winner 
in 
Michigan, 
Missouri 
and 

Mississippi, former Presidential 
candidate Andrew Yang endorsed 
Biden’s campaign.

Business student Jeh Mory was 

at the Students for Biden watch 
party on Tuesday and spoke 
about the former vice president’s 
chances of winning the Democratic 
nomination. 

“I feel pretty optimistic about the 

future,” Mory said. “These wins are 
important and going ahead, I think 
it bodes well for Biden’s chance 
of getting a delegate majority and 
getting the nomination.”

Ekwonye was also at the Students

Biden’s appeal to Republicans as 
well as Democrats. 

“I’m

I 

traditionally don’t agree with the 
majority of Joe Biden’s views, 
but there’s something about Joe 
Biden that separates him from the 
Bernie Sanders wing,” Ekwonye 
said. “Even though he has ideas 
outside of the American tradition, 
he still cares very much about this 
country. It seems that the Bernie 
Sanders campaign comes off as not

Tuesday’s primary, issued a 
statement in a press release 
condemning long lines to vote.

“At a time when Democrats 

correctly attack Republicans 
for voter suppression, it is 
disappointing to see people 
standing in long lines for 
hours today waiting to vote 
in Michigan and around the 
country,” Sanders said in the 
statement. “People should not 
have to miss a day of work to 
exercise their right to vote. 
This is an outrage. Election 
officials must address these 
problems immediately, and if 
necessary, keep polling places 
open longer.”

Mitra said he wished there 

were more locations to register 
in Ann Arbor to reduce the 
length of the lines.

Many University of Michigan 

students in line said they were 
willing to wait because they 
feel their vote matters more 
in Michigan than in their 
home state, given its status as 
a swing state. The University 
of Michigan-Ann Arbor has 
an out of state population 
of nearly 15,000, as of 2019. 
President Donald Trump won 
Michigan by just over 10,000 
votes in 2016. 

Engineering senior Viktoriya 

Kovalchuk had been waiting in 
line to register for more than an 
hour by the time she got inside 
the building. She said those in 
line were given the registration 

forms so they could begin 
filling them out.

Kovalchuk 
emphasized 

the importance of voting and 
said she wanted to change 
her registration to Michigan 
because it is a swing state. 

“It’s worth it,” Kovalchuk 

said. “I know Michigan is 
a swing state, and I’m from 
Arizona, and it’s not a swing 
state. So, I’d rather vote here. … 
(The wait time) is not ideal, but 
I think it’s worth it in the end. 
It’s a priority for me to vote, 
and I just became a citizen 
recently.”

Business 
freshman 
Grace 

Manella recently turned 18 
and voted for the first time on 
Tuesday. She said she chose to 
register in Michigan instead of 
her home state of Kentucky.

“I think it’s important to 

vote 
because 
it’s 
exciting 

that, when you’re younger, 
everyone’s voting and you can’t 
really 
participate,” 
Manella 

said. “I feel like once you can, 
you have this kind of civic duty 
where you feel like you should. 
It’s exciting to kind of feel like 
you’re a part of the system.”

LSA senior Danielle Boilen 

previously 
voted 
with 
an 

absentee 
ballot 
from 
New 

York but chose to register in 
Michigan for this election.

“I did absentee when I voted 

in the last election, and I think 
it’s awesome that I can register 
here on the day of,” Boilen said. 
“I think that’s a great thing 
that Michigan does.”

Rackham student Amanda 

Peiffer said she originally got 

in the line to register to vote 
but only needed to vote. She 
said she wished there were 
more workers at City Hall to 
help the large crowd navigate.

“I 
think 
that 
everyone 

should be able to vote, but I 
think that this is nuts that the 
line is astronomical. It’s just 
another polling place that does 
not run correctly. I think this is 
why a lot of people don’t vote. 
… We need more staff,” Peiffer 
said. “There’s just clearly not 
enough people working. People 
are talking about online voting. 
I think that’d be awesome. 
I 
think 
about 
the 
people 

getting sick and stuff with the 
coronavirus. How are they 
going to vote?”

LSA senior Teddy Kiernan 

came to City Hall to change 
his ballot from Independent to 
Democrat. This is the second 
presidential election he has 
been able to vote in.

“My first election I voted in 

was the general election 2016 
for the president,” Kiernan 
said. “Beyond that, I haven’t 
participated 
in 
any 
other 

elections. … Between the two 
options (in 2016), I wasn’t 
thrilled with either. I’m hoping 
to vote for one person here that 
can stand a fighting chance in 
the general election.”

Justice and Criminal Justice 
Reform” on Tuesday. When 
Heinen 
was 
incarcerated, 

prison guards told her that 
properties 100 miles around 
the prison would not sell 
because the water was toxic. 

“If you got a cup of water and 

tried to make a cup of coffee, 
you can see oil on the top of it 
and little white crystals in it,” 
Heinen said. “And there were 
warnings in the visiting room: 
don’t drink the water, and if 
you’re pregnant, really don’t 
drink the water. But you knew, 
I’m drinking this, I’m bathing 
in this, my clothes are being 
washed in this. You knew you 
were in trouble.”

About 30 students, faculty 

and 
community 
members 

attended the event as a part 
of Earth Day festivities taking 
place 
at 
Michigan 
League 

Tuesday 
afternoon. 
Nora 

Krinitsky, Interim Director 
of the Prison Creative Arts 
Project, led the teach-in, and 
speakers included Heinen and 
Josh Hoe, policy analyst for 
the non-profit Safe and Just 
Michigan. Krinitsky said the 
climate crisis and the carceral 
system 
are 
critical 
issues 

facing society and younger 
generations.

“Those are two very big, 

complicated 
problems 
that 

can feel really overwhelming 
when you’re kind of looking 
at them as an individual,” 
Krinitsky said. “What that 
means is that both of them 
are going to require big social 
movements in order to make 
really significant change.”

Heinen spoke about her 

experience 
going 
through 

Michigan’s prison system for 
decades as she served a three 
back-to-back life sentences. 
As she was transferred from 
prison to prison, she said poor 
conditions were a common 
theme. 
In 
the 
now-closed 

Florence Crane Correctional 
Facility, Heinen said women 
often 
died 
from 
obscure 

medical conditions related to 
the toxic water. 

“As time went on, lifers that 

I was friends with had really 
severe headaches. You’d have 
a period for two months,” 
Heinen said. “They had women 
who had strokes, they had 

tumors, they had rare cancers. 
The generation before me, who 
were there when I arrived, one 
by one by one those women 
died.”

LSA senior Taylor Luthe 

came to the teach-in with a 
personal connection to the 
criminal 
justice 
movement. 

Luthe said her mother was 
incarcerated when she was a 
child, and she had to step out 
of the room for a moment after 
Heinen shared her emotional 
experiences. 

“These people, like she was 

saying, were her sisters and 
the people that she essentially 
grew up with while she was 
inside and were her family,” 
Luthe said. “Just the blatant 
disregard for humanity and 
seeing that come through in 
what she was speaking about, 
and also imagining my mom in 
that situation, imagining these 
horrible 
things 
happening 

to the people that I love was 
hard.”

Hoe 
spoke 
to 
specific 

connections 
between 
the 

criminal justice movement and 
climate movement. He said 
heat, diseases and poor water 
quality, in particular, affect 
prisoners disproportionately. 

“Prisons are the zero point 

of a lot of this climate change 
stuff,” Hoe said. “Mobility is 
what allows you to adapt to 
climate change, and you can’t 
adapt if you can’t move, and 
you can’t adapt if you can’t 
build or do any of the things 
that are necessary to protect 
yourself.”

Engineering 
senior 

Charlie 
Gerard 
told 
The 

Daily after the event that he 
appreciated 
learning 
more 

about the criminal justice 
movement 
from 
Hoe, 
but 

said 
the 
connection 
with 

environmental justice felt like 
a stretch. 

“Obviously, 
there 
are 

unfortunate cases as well, but 
generally if you’re in prison, 
you did something wrong and 
you’re there for punishment,” 
Gerard 
said. 
“Maybe 
the 

climate has an adverse effect, 
but I don’t think that’s a reason 
to remove people from prison.”

As an example of the direct 

impact climate change has on 
prisoners, Hoe told the story 
of Shawna Lynn Jones, one of 
many California prisoners paid 
low wages to fight wildfires. 
Hoe said Jones became the 
first firefighter to die in 2016 
when a boulder hit and killed 
her. 

“She 
was 
22-years-old 

and only three months from 

release, and she was getting 
paid basically nothing to go 
out and risk her life to fight 
fires for a state full of people 
who didn’t want her to be part 
of their community,” Hoe said. 

Luthe said she was angry 

when she heard Jones’s story, 
particularly because she said 
formerly incarcerated people 
often cannot apply the skills 
they learned in prison once 
they are released back into 
society. 

“I 
think 
(Hoe) 
was 

absolutely correct when he 
called it exploitation,” Luthe 
said. “It’s just blatant disregard 
for human life. … I think it’s 
absolutely horrendous that you 
could put your life on the line 
so that other firefighters who 
have not been incarcerated 
don’t have to do that. And yet 
you are not welcomed in … you 
have these skills, but you’re 
not able to use them.”

Matthew Lassiter, assistant 

history professor, said he’s 
noticed 
racial 
disparities 

between 
the 
student 

environmental and criminal 
justice movements in his 20 
years at the University.

“Environmental 
activism 

has 
largely 
tended 
to 
be 

white 
students,” 
Lassiter 

said. 
“They’re 
really 
good 

on issues of environmental 
racism, 
environmental 

justice, 
environmental 

sustainability, but it’s often 
centered around PITE and the 
School of Environment and 
Sustainability … It’s a different 
crowd than when you go to 
a mass incarceration event 
and see a lot more African 
American students and people 
of color there. To me, these 
issues are very intertwined 
and 
that’s 
something 
this 

teach-in can emphasize.”

After the event, Krinitsky 

commented 
on 
the 
broad 

impact of criminal justice and 
environmental justice. 

“These are both movements 

that touch you even if you 
don’t know it yet,” Krinistky 
said. “In some ways, it’s a little 
bit easier to see that when it 
comes to climate justice just 
because of where we imagine 
the climate to be. One thing 
that I say to folks who haven’t 
yet worked on decarceration is 
that I guarantee you that you 
or someone you love is not that 
far away from being involved 
in the criminal justice system.”

Efos 

Idusuye also attended the 
Students for Biden watch party 
and spoke about his support 
for Biden and the need for 
unity within the Democratic 
party. 

“Bernie Sanders and Biden 

supporters are on the same 
party. I think it’s time for us 
to unite,” Idusuye said. “At the 
end, we’re all fighting for the 
same issues against poverty, 
against oppression, and other 
issues.” 

LSA junior Arden Shapiro 

attended a watch party hosted 
by Students for Bernie 2020. As 
polls began to report Biden’s 
large 
lead 
Tuesday 
night, 

Shapiro reacted to the results 
of the Michigan primary.

“I’m just utterly devastated 

for 
the 
organizers 
who 

poured 
everything 
into 

this movement … It’s really 
frustrating and indicative of 
how 
fundamentally 
flawed 

our system is,” Shapiro said. 
“I know it’s not over, I’m so 
you know, I will make sure 
our 
members 
are 
fighting 

and phone banking and doing 
everything 
we 
can.

BIDEN
From Page 2A

Ann Arbor has been named 

the most well-educated city in 
the country, with the highest 
percentage of people with high 
school, associate’s, bachelor’s 
and 
graduate/professional 

degrees, data that suggests 
that Warren would likely have 
found a captive base of voters 
in Ann Arbor.

LSA 
senior 
Martha 

Abrams said she believed 
Warren appealed to a lot of 
students due to her blend of 
progressive politics like those 
championed by Sanders and 
pragmatic policy initiatives 
modeled by Biden.

“Bernie for a lot of people, 

I think, especially in the early 
months of his campaign … 
seemed more like a radical 
progressive than I think a lot 
of people were prepared for,” 
Abrams said. “I think Warren 
was 
a 
more 
… 
palatable 

candidate. I also definitely 
think that having a female 
candidate, 
especially 
one 

who’s so deeply experienced 
in the political arena, and so 
consistent, and a front-runner 
always, was really appealing 
to a lot of people.”

When analyzing the amount 

of individual contributions 
in Ann Arbor and by U-M 
employees, Sanders finished 
in first in both categories. He 
received 2,859 contributions 
from Ann Arbor residents and 
521 contributions from U-M 
employees, whereas Warren 
received 1,685 contributions 
from Ann Arbor residents 
and 311 from U-M employees. 
Sanders’s campaign has made 
a point of relying on smaller-
dollar 
contributions 
since 

2016.

Professor Richard Hall of 

the Gerald Ford School of 
Public Policy discussed how 
individual contributions often 
come from the most extreme 
ends of each political party. 
He explained how Sanders’s 
grassroots 
campaign 

contributions 
could 
have 

significantly helped Sanders 
in the Michigan primary. 

“I think one thing we know 

is that the activists in a party 
and including the individual 
donors to candidates tend 
to be at the extremes … and 
(these) tend to be the people 
who turnout in primaries,” 
Hall said. “There is some 
reason to think that that 
bodes well for Sanders.”

Rackham student Nathan 

John was standing outside 
the Union on primary day 
campaigning for Sanders. He 
said the spirit of Sanders’s 
campaign appealed to him. 

“I think that Bernie is 

running a very grassroots 
oriented campaign, and he’s 

for me. The reason why I’m 
so passionate about him is 
that he does not accept money 
from billionaires,” John said. 
“I think it says that he’s a man 
of the people and someone 
that people are willing to 
get behind. It shows that 
we can change politics by 
focusing on individuals or not 
corporations.”

According to a Michigan 

Daily analysis of campaign 
finance records, in comparing 
Ann Arbor to the state of 
Michigan overall, the trends 
shift slightly, as the overall 
Democratic candidate with 
the highest contributions is 
Sanders with $802,595.66 in 
2019, and former South Bend 
Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who 
received $730,651.04 in 2019, 
before dropping out of the 
race in early March. Then, 
Warren came in third place 
with 
$462,177.22 
and 
Joe 

Biden came in fourth with 
$408,175.22, both in 2019.

Hall noted that money from 

the political establishment 
has 
been 
flooding 
into 

Biden’s campaign since Super 
Tuesday. And with moderates 
such as Buttigieg, Biden and 
Klobuchar 
raising 
a 
total 

of more than $1,270,091.51 
in Michigan, it was unclear 
which way the results of the 
primary would lean up until 
the polls closed Tuesday. 

Money 
doesn’t 
always 

translate 
to 
electoral 

success. If it did, Sec. Hillary 
Clinton would have won the 
Michigan primary in 2016. 
Clinton raised almost triple 
the amount of what Sanders 
raised.

At the time, polls predicted 

that Hillary Clinton had a 
25-point lead over Sanders in 
the Michigan Primary. Polling 
website 
FiveThirtyEight 

went as far as predicting 
that Clinton had a 99 percent 
chance of winning Michigan. 
Yet, 
Sanders 
won 
the 

Michigan 2016 Democratic 
Primary with 49.8 percent 
of the votes compared to 
Clinton, who received just 
48.3 percent of the vote.

As an expert in campaign 

finance, 
Hall 
noted 
that 

money doesn’t tell the whole 
story. 
While 
funding 
is 

necessary to enter a national 
presidential 
race, 
Hall 

explained that past elections 
show throwing money at a 
campaign simply isn’t enough 
to win. 

“It is true that Bloomberg 

made a run because he spent 
all that money. But in the 
end, he lost, you know, pretty 
handily,” Hall said. “(Trump 
was) outspent by … three or 
four of his competitors and 
super PACs are spending on 
behalf of … Bush and Rubio 
in a way they weren’t for 
Trump.”

Hall argued that money 

doesn’t lead to the big wins 
that people imagine. 

“It’s not obvious that the 

money has a big effect,” Hall 
said. “Obviously, you have to 
have some money to get in 
the race but you know, it’s not 
clear how much it matters.”

Additionally, 
the 

momentum and circumstances 
that helped Sanders win in 
2016 are not as evident in the 
2020 primaries against Joe 
Biden. In a New York Times 
interview, 
Brandon 
Dillon, 

a former chairman of the 
Michigan Democratic Party, 
stated that Sanders is no 
longer the “novelty” he was 
four years ago. 

“I know people personally 

who voted for Bernie because 
they wanted to send a message 
to Hillary,” Dillion said in the 
interview. 

Dillon said people are more 

worried about a candidate’s 
electability and ability to beat 
Trump now. 

“People just want to win 

because we know who our 
opponent is and what he can 
do if he gets another four 
years,” Dillon continued.

After Warren suspended 

her campaign in early March 
without endorsing Sanders or 
Biden, her voters were torn. In 
a rally in Ann Arbor three days 
before the primary, Sanders 
stated Michigan was the most 
important state on the March 
11, primaries, urging voters 
that the only way to beat the 
political establishment was to 
vote on Tuesday.

“I 
understand 
that 
Joe 

Biden has the support of the 
entire political establishment. 
I got that,” Sanders said. “But 
we have the support of some 
of the strongest grassroots 
movements in this country, 
and I would 100 times over 
prefer 
to 
have 
grassroots 

support than establishment 
support.”

Hall adds that similarly to 

Trump, Sanders is raising a 
significant amount of money 
from individual donors. 

“(It’s) just not clear how 

much … difference and that’s 
going to make (or if) it’s going 
to be enough to help him 
carry the day … like it did in 
Michigan for him four years 
ago,” Hall said. 

Tuesday’s results affirmed 

Hall’s 
argument. 
Despite 

his massive campaign push 
in the final weekend and 
his hundreds of thousands 
of individual contributions, 
Sanders’s 
grassroots 

campaign was not enough for 
a victory in Michigan.

S

ince Hasan Minhaj’s release 
of his talk show “Patriot 
Act With Hasan Minhaj” 

in 2018, the former Daily Show 
correspondent was met with high 
praise for his perfect blend of catharsis 
and criticism. Every Sunday, Minhaj 
conquers a new pressing political issue, 
from his first episode on affirmative 
action 
to 
his 
internationally-

contested one on corruption in 
Saudi Arabia, all while maintaining 
a strong level of relatability with 
his predominantly young audience 
of first-generation millennials and 
members of Generation Z. Patriot 
Act is undoubtedly one of the most 
successful comedic talk shows on 
Netflix, but Minhaj’s humor isn’t the 
reason. Political comedy has wandered 
into an era of condescension and self-
righteousness that ultimately rewards 
anyone who fuels this attitude, 
showering them with endless views 
and retweets. In today’s age of cancel 
culture, rampant moral outrage and 
the never-ending need to “out-woke” 
the next person, political comedy is 
slowly losing its footing. A genre that 
once served as a form of catharsis from 
serious issues in political discourse 
has deviated into superficial post-
humor activism where each punchline 
searches for applause instead of laughs.

Transformative 
moments 
in 

American politics demand a method 
for coping, but that becomes more 
difficult when every joke seems to 
be followed by solemnity. This was 
first witnessed after the tragic 9/11 
attacks when The Daily Show host Jon 
Stewart delivered an overwhelmingly 
emotional monologue that was far 
from comedic, and again after the 2016 
presidential election where Late Show 
host Stephen Colbert confronted his 
own genre of entertainment saying, 
“I’m not sure if it’s a comedy show 
at this point” — and he’s right. Talk 
shows endure a grieving period to 
console viewers on recent devastating 
events. But apart from this collective 
recovery, what was once considered 
a method for coping has turned into 
mockery and overt contempt that 
further intensifies and reinforces 
extreme partisan views. As a 2017 
study might suggest, this genre’s 
current dry cynicism and induced 
confirmation bias creates and fortifies 
these attitudes.

While Minhaj’s show might have 

more informative content to pair 
with the entertaining ridicule of 
politicians, his and others’ preachy 
activism isn’t improving politics in 
any way — it’s just making comedy 
worse. It’s a noble goal for comedy 
to try and make up for where proper 
political representation and resolution 
is lacking, but effective activism is not 
going to be found in an industry where 
the first priority is comic relief. What 
should be two distinct professions has 
melded together into a new role: the 
cometician. The “cometician” serves 
as the middle ground for both the 
comedian and the politician, making 
up for where the other lacks in either 
seriousness or humor.

Minhaj played the “cometician” 

when he was asked to testify before 
Congress about the student debt crisis 
last September, but when his testimony 
is received as “cute” and disingenuous 
by some politicians on account of a 
few pop culture references, this role 
begins to fall apart. And comedians 
aren’t the only ones trying to dip their 
feet into two pools: Politicians are 
taking on a more comedic persona. 
During his two terms, former 
President Barack Obama gained a 
reputation for his exceptional humor 
in delivering the traditional joke-filled 
monologues at the annual White 
House Correspondents’ Dinner. But 
supporters adored his wit for more 
reasons than his self-aware and 
relevant punchlines. President Obama 
struck a skillful balance between the 
conventional self-deprecation that 
accompanies 
presidential 
humor 

and the more assertive subgenre of 
weaponized comedy. The latter is a 
strategy that comedians often use in 
order to further their own political 
sentiments by delivering punchlines 
that not-so-subtly strike a chord 
among a politically aligned audience.

While the Obama administration 

found success in aspects of this 
approach, other politicians are still 
figuring it out. Former Democratic 
presidential 
candidate 
Michael 

Bloomberg launched the Meme 2020 
project as part of his campaign in order 
to reach a wider, younger audience 
and to gain credibility online. For 
obvious reasons, Mayor Bloomberg’s 
publicly sponsored memes were ill-
received by online culture, and his 
attempt at self-aware humor left him 
at a disadvantage. And it doesn’t seem 

to help that he is arguably the spitting 
image of President Donald Trump 
in terms of public persona — but at 
least in Trump’s case, he’s not paying 
millions of dollars to be made fun of.

While 
politicians 
are 
having 

trouble 
navigating 
the 
field 
of 

comedy, comedians aren’t necessarily 
dominating politics either. It seems 
that outside of his Manhattan 
production studio and the cyber realm 
of Democratic Twitter, Minhaj’s 
content is met with scattered laughs 
and weak applause. And that’s because 
his content isn’t for everyone. Today’s 
political comedy is directed toward a 
closed-off audience of people who are 
either looking for their next opinion 
or for another way to fuel their self-
righteous moral outrage. Apart from 
this audience, no one really reaps 
any benefits from political comedy. 
Instead, the same jokes attacking the 
Trump administration or mocking 
the 2020 presidential candidates are 
recycled over and over again within 
the Comedy Central network. And it’s 
not funny anymore.

It’s time to reevaluate how comedy 

fits into politics, because let’s be real, 
it’s counterproductive and repetitive. 
Today more than ever, politics is 
constantly intertwined with everyday 
issues, and it’s important to advocate 
for what we believe in. But there’s 
a lot of noise and misinformation 
surrounding any real conversation 
for change, and part of that is our 
fault. We demand entertainment and 
drama while refusing to acknowledge 
the advantage of a more critically 
constructive approach to political 
activism. We’ve given comedians the 
opportunity to stand before Congress 
and crack jokes to politicians who 
refuse to take them seriously. We’ve 
allowed for moral anger to be the 
status quo — where the only views 
that exist are under extremism or 
ignorance. Although indifference is 
the enemy to progress, perhaps our 
woke factor needs the night off once 
in a while. And political comedy can 
once again become the biting but 
good-natured means of relief. our 
woke factor needs the night off once 
in a while. And political comedy can

Political Comedy is not a joke — but it should be

ontent warning: This piece 
contains graphic descriptions 
of sexual assault.

It’s not something I talk about. It’s 

not even something I think about if I 
can avoid it. But I think it’s time for 
that to change.

Last year, just a few months into 

my freshman year, I became a victim 
of sexual assault.

It was mid-November, and I was 

at a mixer my sorority had with a 
couple of fraternities we have events 
with. I won’t name the fraternity I 
was at, because the truth is it could’ve 
been any fraternity on this campus 
— and at some point, it probably has 
been.

A couple of weekends before, I had 

gotten set up for the date party of one 
of the fraternities we were mixing 
with. I really liked my date, but I 
hadn’t spoken to him since the night 
of the date party (more accurately, 
he hadn’t responded to my text or 
added me on social media), and the 
realization was dawning on me that 
he was just going to be someone I had 
been set up with once.

So, I decided I needed to move 

on. “I need to kiss a boy tonight,” 
I remember telling my friends. I 
remember putting on an outfit that 
was a little bold for me, a little more 
skin than I was used to showing, 
and I remember starting to feel the 
buzz from the pregame and the 
boxed wine I had upon arriving 
at the mixer. I remember feeling 
confident. Feeling like the night was 
going to be a success.

I remember looking around the 

fraternity’s basement, searching 
for my date, trying to see if he was 
there. Maybe he was just busy this 
week; maybe it wouldn’t have been 
just that one night with us.

Or maybe — and I’m not proud 

of this — he’d see me with someone 
else.

I don’t know if the boy from the 

date party ever showed up that 
night. But about an hour into the 
mixer, I found the someone else.

He was standing on an elevated 

surface and noticed me dancing 
with my friends. He grabbed my 
hand, spun me around. It was fun. 
I felt pretty. I felt noticed. He pulled 
me up onto the elevated surface 
with him.

We started dancing, introduced 

ourselves. He was a year older, 
and I remember looking down at 
my friends and getting a look of 
approval back. “He’s cute,” one of 
them mouthed at me. We started 
making out. It was a normal 
fraternity party experience.

And then it wasn’t. Or maybe — 

unfortunately — it was.

I felt his hands on my chest, then 

inside the band of my underwear, 
and this was too far for a guy I had 
met 10 minutes ago. I tried to move 
his hands away, but he had a foot of 
height and probably 50 pounds or 
more on me, and he shook me off 
easily and kept going. He pulled me 
off the elevated surface and I tried 
to look for my friends, but couldn’t 
find them in the crowd.

He started pulling me toward 

the door, toward the nebulous 
“upstairs” where I knew enough 
to know his room was up there 
somewhere. I knew what he 
thought was going to happen.

Luckily — so, so luckily for me 

— I wasn’t as drunk as he thought I 
was. I dragged my feet as he pulled 
me along. I started with the typical 
excuses. “I have a 9 a.m. tomorrow.” 
I didn’t. “I have to be up early.” I 
didn’t. “My friend is so drunk, I 
have to make sure she’s okay.” The 
friends I was with that night had all 
had less to drink than I had, and we 
were all holding up just fine.

He didn’t buy it and kept pulling 

me upstairs. He stopped for a second 
in a corner, and I was relieved. 
Maybe I’d gotten out after all. And 
then his hands were back, inside my 
underwear again, inside of me, and I 
couldn’t get him to move his hands 
away.

“Stop,” I said. “No, stop, please, I 

just met you —” 

“Come on,” he said and started 

pulling me toward the door again.

Every single day, I’m thankful for 

what happened next. We ran into a 
girl who lived in my hall. She and I 
were friendly, and had even gotten 
a few meals at South Quad together, 
but we joined different sororities 
and had never been all that close. 
But she saw us, saw enough to guess 
what was going on. She came over 
to me and started talking. To his 
surprise, the boy let go of my hand, 
and that girl from my hall led me 
away from him and put me in an 
Uber back to West Quad.

We all know what would’ve 

happened if I hadn’t run into her 
right then.

The state of Michigan defines 

what happened to me that night as 
criminal sexual assault in the third 
degree, but I knew I wasn’t going 
to press charges or report it. The 
system is too broken. No matter 
what I did, nothing was going to 
happen. 

I knew what people would say. 

I had been drinking, had been 

wearing revealing clothes — never 
mind the fact that I was barely 
tipsy, just a couple drinks in, and 
while, what I was wearing was bold 
for me, it was still pretty standard 
fare for a fraternity party, and 
not at all revealing by my friends’ 
standards.

That 
night 
I 
had 
done 

everything I’d been taught. I didn’t 
get too drunk, I stayed within my 
limit, I came with friends. It was a 
fraternity I knew well, a fraternity I 
felt comfortable at.

It still happened.
What I wanted — what I still 

want — is to move on, not to let 
it affect me. I still go back to that 
fraternity, still have a drink or two 
(or more) on occasion, even still 
wear that outfit. That boy doesn’t 
get to take any of that away from 
me.

But not every girl is so lucky. 

Not every girl has the luxury, the 
luck of getting out like I did. Not 
every girl can move on as I’ve tried 
to.

And for all of us, the system is 

broken. So, so beyond broken that 
I knew from the moment that 
I walked out of that fraternity 
house that I wasn’t going to do 
anything about it — that I couldn’t 
do anything about it. Not when 
this University has a history if 
instutional sexual misconduct.

That’s how broken the system 

is. Not just generally, but at the 
University of Michigan.

So broken that I knew from 

the moment this happened to me 
that I knew there was nothing I 
could do about it but keep moving 
forward. So I did.

I don’t know what I expect 

to happen as a result of this 
article coming out. I certainly 
don’t 
expect 
anything 
from 

the University; I’ve learned I 
can’t expect anything from the 
University in this arena. 

But with all this going on, I 

need to speak up. Need someone 
— anyone — to hear me when I 
say: 

me too.

T

he 
results 
are 
in: 

Former Vice President 
Joe Biden has taken 

Michigan. His strong support 
from populous counties like 
Wayne and Oakland, as well 
as an endorsement from Gov. 
Gretchen Whitmer, have no 
doubt contributed to this 
outcome.

On Feb. 23, before the 

Michigan 
Primary, 
The 

Michigan 
Daily 
Editorial 

Board endorsed Sen. Bernie 
Sanders, I-Vt., for Democratic 
presidential 
candidate. 

Following a long, in-depth 
discussion on the strengths 
and weaknesses of the possible 
candidates at the time, the 
Editorial Board came to the 
conclusion that Sanders best 
represented the interests of 
our student body and remained 
the only candidate who was 
uniquely equipped to defeat 
President 
Donald 
Trump’s 

incumbency. 
The 
senator’s 

policies 
regarding 
climate 

change, universal healthcare 
and forgiveness of student 
debt are the main factors that 
led to this conclusion. 

In the weeks following 

this 
endorsement, 
the 

Opinion 
Desk 
stands 
by 

the 
Editorial 
Board’s 

decision. Within Washtenaw 
County and especially the 
University of Michigan, it 
appears 
Sanders 
enjoys 
a 

great amount of support. As 
demonstrated by his heavily 
attended campaign rally on 
the Diag this past Sunday, 

the 
senator 
maintains 
a 

passionate stronghold among 
voters in the Ann Arbor 
area. The results of Super 
Tuesday, while undoubtedly 
disappointing for the Sanders 
campaign, greatly narrowed 
the playing field of potential 
nominees. With only Sanders 
and Biden emerging as viable 
contenders, it was clear that 
Sanders remained a strong 
option for Tuesday’s primary 
in Michigan. 

In 
a 
county 
that 
was 

comparatively 
supportive 

of Sanders last night, it is 
important to refrain from 
demonizing 
Biden 
moving 

into the general election. In 
endorsement 
discussions, 

no member of the Editorial 
Board ultimately put their 
support behind the former 
vice president. However, we 
were able to discuss as a group 
his strengths as a candidate, 
such as his long-standing 
experience in governmental 
affairs, history of reaching 
across the aisle to work with 
republicans, name familiarity 
and high polling numbers in 
the South and among racial 
minorities.

At this time, it appears 

as though Biden will be the 
Democratic Party’s nominee 
come the general election. 
With that in consideration, 
it is important for Democrats 
to rally behind Biden should 
he win the nomination and 
keep 
the 
characteristics 

that may allow him to win 

the presidency in mind. For 
example, Biden appears to be 
the most capable candidate 
to win in areas previously 
won by Trump in the 2016 
election. Additionally, former 
candidates including former 
Mayor of South Bend, Ind., 
Pete 
Buttigieg, 
Sen. 
Amy 

Klobuchar, 
D-Minn., 
Sen. 

Kamala 
Harris, 
D-Calif., 

Former 
Representative 

Beto 
O’Rourke, 
Andrew 

Yang and Sen. Cory Booker, 
D-N.J., have all endorsed Joe 
Biden. With the formation 
of such a coalition, Biden 
has strengthened his base 
of supporters going into the 
general election. 

While the Editorial Board’s 

endorsement did not match up 
with the results of the state 
of Michigan, they should not 
discourage all U-M and Ann 
Arbor voters from staying 
passionate about the election. 
Voter turnout is expected 
to rise in the 2020 elections 
compared to previous years, 
and 
we 
encourage 
our 

community 
to 
participate 

in the heightened political 
engagement. And even if you 
won’t be voting for your ideal 
candidate in November, the 
only thing worse than that is 
not voting at all.

Sophie Allison — or as the 

music world knows her — 
Soccer Mommy, has spent the 
last year and a half since the 
release of her debut album 
Clean on the rise. In 2019, 
Allison 
performed 
at 
some 

of the most prominent music 
festivals of the year, including 
Coachella and Governors Ball. 
She released the single “Lucy” 
in early November 2019, and 
then followed it up with single 
“yellow is the color of her 
eyes.” On Feb. 28, 2020, Allison 
released her sophomore studio 
album, Color Theory. Soccer 
Mommy’s fans were eager for 
more of her signature style, 
with her sweet, airy vocals that 
sometimes go rough during the 
climax of a song. 

The 
two 
aforementioned 

singles 
were 
perfect 

predecessors for the release. 
Where Clean was Allison’s edgy, 
powerful and raw entrance 
into the world of popular 
alternative music, Color Theory 
is the album that shows how 
comfortable she has become in 
the industry. Songs like “Lucy” 
and 
“bloodstream” 
channel 

even more of an alternative-
rock sound than what was 
present on Clean. Instead of 
overloading the project with 
slow ballads, Allison uses songs 
like “night swimming” and 
“crawling in my skin” as the 
deeper cuts. While these tracks 
are certainly emotional, they’re 
not slow and sad. 

Though the album as a whole 

is almost perfectly unified, 
there are spots where the album 
drags a little, which diminishes 
the 
effect 
of 
other 
songs. 

For example, “stain,” a song 
that has a guitar pattern that 
sounds just like the beginning 
to Eminem’s “Lose Yourself,” 

does not fit in with the feel-
good sounds of the rest of the 
album. Having this song second 
to last slows down the album in 
a way that doesn’t give the last 
song, “gray light,” the justice it 
deserves. While “gray light” is 
slower, it’s an almost uplifting 
song, but following in the dark, 
unnecessarily sad shadow of 
“stain” makes it less powerful. 
While “yellow is the color of 
her eyes” is a beautiful song 
and was a great choice as one of 
the album’s singles, its length is 
a little excessive. Fortunately, 

Allison follows it up with “up 
the walls,” a short and bouncy 
song clocking in at just over two 
and a half minutes. 

Allison took her sadness 

and pain and made it into an 
album that (miraculously) isn’t 
a huge bummer. Clean is the 
perfect album to listen to when 
you need a good hour-long cry. 
Color Theory is the album for 
your recovery. Though much of 
the subject matter isn’t happy, 
like heartbreak and distance, 
I still somehow leave listening 
to the album feeling at peace. 
Allison creates a distinct sense 
of hope on even her saddest 
songs off of Color Theory. The 
best example of this comes at 
the end of her last song, “gray 
light.” While it’s definitely a 
sad song, it rapidly culminates 
to an ending that then cuts 
out prematurely. Closing the 
album on a perhaps unfinished 
note leaves the ending open, 
conveying an indistinguishable 
feeling of hope for the future. I 
truly don’t know how she does 
it, but maybe that mystery is 
what makes Soccer Mommy so 
damn good.

ALBUM REVIEW
ALBUM REVIEW

One of the biggest weeks 

of the year for many DIY 
bands is the week of South by 
Southwest, a week-long arts 
festival in Austin, Texas that 
features 
independent 
films, 

musicians and other artists. 
Groups often plan week-long 
tours on their way to Austin in 
hopes of promoting their music 
and expanding their audience at 
the festival. This year, however, 
there’s been a change of plans; 
due to the over looming threat of 
COVID-19, the city of Austin has 
decided to cancel the festival.

This is the first time in the 

event’s 34-year history that 
anything like this has happened, 
and bands are not thrilled. 
Many 
of 
these 
bands 
use 

South by Southwest as a yearly 
opportunity to gain exposure 
from 
different 
publications, 

websites and music fanatics at 
large. With the announcement 
coming less than two weeks 
before the festival was slated to 
begin, the hours of preparation 
and effort these groups put into 
planning their trips has gone 
out the window, with many 
scrambling to find any and all 
opportunities to play around 
the city.

The city’s decision to cancel 

the 
festival 
comes 
at 
the 

recommendation 
of 
Austin’s 

Public Health officers. After 
declaring 
a 
local 
disaster, 

Mayor Steve Adler canceled the 
festival. SXSW, in a statement, 
said they were devastated, but 
they would “faithfully follow 
the City’s directions.”

The SXSW crisis also signals 

another issue the coronavirus 
could potentially lead to: concert 
attendance. DIY musicians fund 
their tours through small door 
fees which allow them to pay 
for tour expenses like gas and 

food. However, with the fear of 
large public events that COVID-
19 has instilled in a growing 
percentage 
of 
the 
world’s 

populous, touring bands may 
not be able to depend on these 
shows as much for support. This 
also presents a larger issue for 
more established bands that use 
music as their full-time career 
and depend on touring revenue 
as income. 

Many travel-based industries, 

like airlines, are already seeing 
a significant decline in profits 
in just the past few weeks, and 
I believe we will see similar 
trends in the entertainment 
industry. Especially in the age 
of streaming, artists rely heavily 
upon the money made from 
touring — to lose that source of 
income could be devastating to 
many musicians. 

I’m not sure how basement 

shows will be affected by this 
outbreak, but I doubt it will 
increase attendance. Though 
I’ve definitely seen a small 
increase in attendance at local 
shows 
recently, 
I’m 
fairly 

certain that being in a dark, 
damp and crowded basement 
probably will not help to prevent 
the virus’s spread. Not only 
could this cause a decrease in 
the amount of shows around 
town, but also discourage out-
of-town bands from coming 
into a town containing a large 
population of college students 
who just returned from spring 
break.

That being said, now is a 

more 
important 
time 
than 

ever to support artists through 
purchasing 
albums 
and 

merchandise. I know some local 
Michigan groups, like Shadow 
Show and Dogleg, were planning 
on heading down to SXSW after 
gaining a considerable amount 
of popularity in the past year. 
Supporting these local artists, 
even just a little bit, could make 
a huge difference, especially as 
we enter a time where live music 
could suffer a significant loss in 
attendance.

DAILY DIY COLUMN

About a third of the way 

through Jenny Offill’s second 
novel, “Dept. of Speculation,” 
the unnamed narrator gives a 
brief account of Manichaeism: 
“The 
Manicheans 
believed 

the world was filled with 
imprisoned light, fragments of 
a God who destroyed himself 
because he no longer wished 
to exist,” the narrator notes 
dispassionately. Like a good 
deal of the other fragments that 
make up the novel, this anecdote 
is never explicitly explained or 
tied into a thematic concern 

— it just stands as-is for the 
reader to interpret how they 
would like to. Sometimes these 
anecdotal pieces come back 
when something else reminds 
the narrator of it. 

Offill doesn’t coyly include 

passages that state the aims 
of her game, but this passage 
works for an encapsulation of 
her method and its place in 
the history of the novel — she 
scatters fragments of a Realist 
god that no longer works for the 
narrative aims of contemporary 
authors. In lieu of a quest, 
we 
have 
crate-digging 
and 

rumination, 
the 
movement 

of ideas in a mind. Each little 
fragment is a premise the 
narrator is testing, a moment 

to consider and weigh in the 
mesh of the whole. Historical 
anecdotes and quotes from 
writers have the same weight 
in the narrator’s mind as the 
literal events of her life. All of 
it is evidence. There’s no real 
quest for an Offill narrator, 
there’s just a lot of casting 
around, like a person after a 
shipwreck grabbing for pieces 
of driftwood. 

It’s a useful form to depict 

a crisis with no easy answer. 
In “Dept. of Speculation” this 
crisis was a woman considering 
separation from an adulterous 
husband who she clearly still 
cares for. In her new novel, 
“Weather,” 
Offill’s 
narrator 

is a deeply empathetic person 

trying to reckon with climate 
change, a problem that doesn’t 
really have any solutions on 
the level of the individual. 
The title is apt — the word 
“weather” 
can 
be 
thought 

of as the phenomenological 
experience of climate on a day-
to-day basis. You might notice 
that it’s getting warmer earlier 
in the year or that it’s raining 
more, but all you’re really doing 
is being anecdotal. You’re not 
talking about the climate. 

The 
outside 
citations 
in 

“Weather” are a little more 
focused than in “Dept. of 
Speculation.” 
Lizzie, 
the 

failed 
grad 
student 
and 

current librarian was writing 
a dissertation on comparative 
religion when she dropped out 
of school and is married to a 
similarly failed classicist. The 
fragments that Lizzie culls 
to look at her own life are 
frequently 
considerations 
of 

ethics and morality. She seems 
to share the ambivalence of a 
lot of millennials and younger 
Gen-Xers, 
an 
aversion 
to 

unqualified earnestness that 
dovetails with very real concern 
about the direction society is 
moving. Her commitment to 
compassion stands out — she 
takes a car service run by a man 
named Jimmy who lost the rest 
of his drivers (she says she does 
it “because I’m ridiculous”). At 
one point, Lizzie finds herself 
repeating a mantra in the 
shower — “Sentient creatures 
are numberless. I vow to save 
them.”

Lizzie’s porousness, the way 

things tend to get under her 
skin, makes her unsuited for the 
job she starts at the beginning 
of the novel — she works for 
her former dissertation adviser, 
Sylvia, who travels around for 
a series of TED-like lectures 

and maintains a podcast about 
the end of the world. Lizzie’s 
job is to respond to the emails 
listeners of the podcast send 
in. Lizzie gets swept up into 
the world of the weirdos and 
doomsday preppers who ask 
Sylvia questions — even as 
Lizzie makes fun of them 
and 
maintains 
a 
kind 
of 

critical distance, she starts 
to participate in their world, 
to read “prepper” blogs and 
start stockpiling lighters and 
first-aid equipment. In the 
meantime, she is taking care of 
her brother, a former addict who 
is engaged to a woman Lizzie 
doesn’t 
like 
(she 
describes 

her as “a weird mix of hard-
edged 
and 
hippie-minded”), 

taking care of her son Eli and 
negotiating life as a working 
mother in Brooklyn. Her life 
continually intersects with her 
work in strange ways, and part 
of the pleasure of this novel is 
the sense of total immersion 
in someone’s mind that Offill’s 
atemporal narrative methods 

allow for. 

This 
novel 
is 
more 

thematically 
compact 
than 

“Dept. of Speculation,” which 
tended to sprawl a little. It’s 
also more fluidly organized: 
instead of the chapter breaks 
in the earlier novel (what are 
those for exactly?) “Weather” 
is split into six long sections 
of continuous movement. It 
plays to the advantages of the 
form, driving home the free-
fall quality. Offill seems to have 
a better grasp on the different 
uses of the fragment form here. 
“Dept. of Speculation” was 
pretty 
consistently 
all-over-

the-place; in “Weather” there 
are moments that resemble 
the paragraphs of traditional 
fiction and there are moments 
that resemble the discontinuity 
of a Twitter feed. In all 
respects — the development of 
the thematic concerns, the skill 
with which the form is used — 
this novel feels like a graceful, 
organic 
progression 
from 

the earlier book at a moment 
where the form Offill helped 
inaugurate is at risk of being 
reduced to a cliché or a stock 
method.

“There’s, like, two people here. 

Oh my God, this is hilarious,” 
my 
friend, 
Annie, 
said 
in 

between 
forced 
chuckles 
of 

disappointment. The two of us 
were standing in an endearingly 
short line for an EDM concert 
outside of Detroit’s Magic Stick 
Theatre. 

We had been anticipating this 

concert ever since Annie sent me a 
manic string of texts last semester, 
exclaiming 
in 
all 
uppercase 

that one of her favorite EDM 
artists, BAYNK, was performing 
in Detroit the first weekend of 
spring break, and that we “NEED 
TO GO!!” Though I never really 
enjoyed EDM music, the idea of 
checking out a rave-ish scene 
and visiting Detroit for the first 
time seemed exciting. So I obeyed 
Annie’s frenzied text messages 
and bought a ticket. 

Annie spent the few weeks 

leading up to the big night talking 
me through her crash-course on 
EDM/rave culture. She passed 
on many a disclaimer, preparing 
me for a colorful concert crowd of 
rave-junkies decked out in spandex 
and fishnets mixed in with your 
classic, more basic-looking EDM 
connoisseurs. Fashioning herself 

as a kind of expert on all things 
EDM, she was quick to warn me 
that the crowd would be high on 
drugs of all kinds and we might 
have to stand our ground should 
moshing ensue. She was hoping 
for a packed venue to give me a 
sufficient first impression of EDM 
concerts, which have always been 
one of her greatest loves.

Finally, the night came. We 

found our way to a street in 
Midtown 
Detroit 
flickering 

with the neon lights of clubs, 
theatres and bars, all pulsing 
with the spirits of intoxicated 
Michiganders. Annie let out a 
nervous giggle as we approached 
the theatre just a few minutes 
before the doors were supposed 
to open; there were a mere two 
people waiting outside. 

“BAYNK 
hasn’t 
been 

discovered yet. So only, like, true 
EDM people will be here tonight,” 
she assured me as a big guy with 
lots of tattoos made his way down 
the line checking people’s IDs. He 
gifted the small group of concert-
attendees in front of us with neon 
wristbands while Annie and I 
got big black “X”s marked on our 
hands with a fat Sharpie.

Soon, the doors opened and 

we made our way upstairs to the 
concert venue. We spent the next 
thirty minutes or so before the 
show started observing the other 
hyper-punctual concert-goers.

Those milling about Magic 

Stick that night were a funny mix 
— there were couples sipping on 
canned beers and frat-looking 
guys in their usual sweatshirt-
and-jersey-uniforms and, just as 
Annie promised, there were the 
token rave-kids who didn’t seem 
to catch the memo that BAYNK’s 
sets are more low-key than other 
EDM artists. The ravers quickly 
marked the far right side of the 
venue as their territory as they 
unpacked their circus toys and 
light-up trinkets. Annie, I, and 
the frat boys all looked on in 
wonderment as the nearly-naked 
bunch assembled their own mini-
rave in the corner, meticulously 
wrapping themselves in neon 
ropes like they were practicing an 
art form. 

“Guess we’ll just stand here and 

watch them like it’s the show,” 
Annie said. I couldn’t help but 
laugh at how this whole night 
was turning out; it’d probably 
be another hour or two before 
BAYNK actually came on and all 
of Annie’s build-up would come 
into fruition. Though, for now, 
we were stuck in a nearly-empty 
venue, entertaining ourselves by 
observing the ravers like they 
were animals in a zoo.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK
MUSIC NOTEBOOK

As I settled into the new 

Netflix original drama “All the 
Bright Places,” directed by Brett 
Haley (“Hearts Beat Loud”) and 
adapted from (and co-written 
by) Jennifer Niven’s popular YA 
novel of the same name, it quickly 
seemed like it would be another 
mawkish romance populated by 
tired gender tropes. 

Starring Elle Fanning (“20th 

Century Women”) as Violet, a 
teenage girl who recently lost 
her sister in a car accident, 
and Justice Smith (“Detective 
Pikachu”) as Finch, an eccentric 
loner labeled a freak by his peers, 
the film follows the relationship 
kindled by the two high schoolers 
after Finch talks Violet down 
from jumping off a bridge, grief-
ridden after the death of her 
sister. Nothing’s sexier than grief 
and fresh trauma after all! That 
the story did a gender-swap of 
another trope and made Finch 
into a sort of Manic Pixie Dream 
Boy didn’t entirely help either.

At 
first, 
this 
“meet-cute” 

seemed to establish yet another 
tale of a sad girl with sad problems 

who really only needs a boy to 
swoop in and set things right for 
her. But “swooping in and setting 
things right” isn’t quite so simple. 
The film delicately navigates 
themes of mental health, suicide 
and teen angst in a way that 
doesn’t betray reality in the usual 
saccharine and sanguine way of 
many teen romances. It’s quick 

to sunder the cliché it seemed to 
be settling itself into: Finch is not 
there to fix everything, as he has 
a lot in his own boat, possessed 
by dark moods and childhood 
trauma that compel him to 
disappear for days at a time. 

But this also isn’t a story 

of broken people finding that 
they fit each other like two 
serendipitously-fractured puzzle 

pieces — neither is it some ode to 
the mystical medicinal properties 
of love. That would not do justice 
to the sort of baggage that people 
like Violet and Finch carry, or to 
the lived experiences of any given 
person. Love is great and all, but 
even in love (maybe especially 
in love) people say the wrong 
things, do the wrong things — try 
to help when they shouldn’t and 
don’t when they should. Finch is 
pushy and doesn’t seem to think 
about context or boundaries all 
the time; Violet isn’t prescient 
enough or as helpful about Finch’s 
ordeals as she probably should be. 
Solace is found together, some 
growth is made, but it isn’t a cure-
all.

The story is punctuated by 

idyllic scenery as Finch and 
Violet explore this solace, biking 
along Indiana trails, dancing 
in country fields, swimming in 
secluded lakes. Those looking for 
the cute antics of a burgeoning 
couple will be satisfied by the 
many sweet moments brought 
to life by the light, awkward and 
natural chemistry shared by 
Fanning and Smith.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Wednesday, March 11, 2020 — 7A

The No. 18 Michigan softball team 

leapt out to a hot 10-0 start before 
cooling down and arriving at a 15-8 
record. Entering their first series in 
Ann Arbor, the Wolverines will look to 
reacquire their early season success, 
starting with Ball State on Saturday.

A relatively inexperienced roster has 

led to shuffling at every position and a 
lineup that has not fully settled in. For 
Michigan to make a run similar to the 
33-3 one it had after returning home in 
2019, it will have to rely on all levels of 
its roster.

The 
Daily 
breaks 
down 
the 

Wolverines’ lineup by position for an 
in-depth look at where they have found 
stability and where they haven’t so far, as 
they look to replace last year’s graduated 
starters and reclaim the Big Ten title.

Pitchers:
Michigan’s pitching success, along 

with the success of the entire team, 
stops and ends with its returning 
top two: junior left-hander Meghan 
Beaubien and sophomore right-hander 
Alex Storako.

Beaubien is coming off of a year where 

she posted a 1.87 ERA and finished with 
a 30-6 record — a seemingly strong 
sophomore performance that, in reality, 
was seen as a regression from her first 
team All-American freshman campaign 
in which she touted a 1.16 ERA and 
0.67 WHIP. This year, Beaubien has 
performed at a high level game after 
game, and although her statistics are not 
quite those of her first year, she holds an 
impressive 1.52 ERA and 0.86 WHIP. In 
Beaubien, the Wolverines have found 
consistency, a rare commodity so far 
this season.

Storako, 
the 
second 
punch 
in 

Michigan’s pitching attack, does just 
that — attack. Storako throws strikeouts 
at a high clip, dishing out 141 so far and 
averaging 1.88 per inning. At the same 
time, Storako’s punishing approach 
has led to 34 walks and a 2.43 ERA. 
Developing 
more 
consistency 
and 

control will be key to whether Storako 
can reach her ceiling as a lethal pitcher 
by eliminating walks and big plays.

In the early stages of her development 

is freshman right-hander Chandler 
Dennis. While currently posting a 7.00 
ERA in just four appearances and one 
start, it’s hard to tell to what degree 
Dennis will be involved in the rotation 
as the season progresses. Despite the 
glaring ERA, Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins believes Dennis is “capable of 
some great things.” Expect to see Dennis 
more involved as a relief pitcher as the 
season progresses, with a possibility 
that she makes it into a limited role in 
the starting rotation. 

Catchers:
Sophomore Hannah Carson has 

claimed the catcher position as her 
own. After filling a backup role in 
her 
freshman 
year 
behind 
now-

graduated 
two-year 
captain 
Katie 

Alexander, Carson has started behind 
the plate every game this season for 
the Wolverines, and she hasn’t shown 
any signs of relinquishing the position. 
Carson is currently batting .284 and at 
the top of the team with 10 RBI. 

Backup responsibilities, if Carson 

were to fall to an injury, are assumed 
to go to senior Abby Skvarce, who is 
currently nestled in at the designated 
player spot. 

First base:
First base has proved to be a shared 

position thus far, being split between 
juniors Lou Allan and Taylor Bump. 
Allan, coming off of freshman and 
sophomore years plagued with injuries, 
has seen the majority of starts at first. 
It’s difficult to argue with her .403 
slugging percentage and team-leading 
10 RBI that she shouldn’t get them. 
Allan’s drawbacks stem from her lack of 
speed on the basepath, not helped by her 
previous injuries.

Bump, while sometimes getting the 

start, fills her role at first more often 
than not midway through the game — 
usually after Allan is pulled for a pinch 
runner. Bump, holding a .171 batting 
average and .310 on-base percentage 
while also having the range to play 
multiple positions, slots herself as a 
versatile infield utility player but not a 
consistent starter. This can place her on 
either of the corners, leading to playing 
time split between first and third.

Middle infield:
For 
two 
years, 
junior 
Natalia 

Rodriguez 
has 
been 
Michigan’s 

starting shortstop. Through 14 games 
this season, that remained true. Then, 
Hutchins did something unexpected 
and switched Rodriguez with freshman 
second baseman Julia Jimenez. Through 
the past nine games, it has remained 
like that — Jimenez at shortstop and 
Rodriguez at second. 

Rodriguez has struggled at the 

plate, holding on to a lowly .188 batting 
average, but the slap-hitter has never 
been in the starting lineup because of 
her batting. It was her fielding that held 
her there, and it’s not like Hutchins has 
removed Rodriguez from the batting 
order by shifting her over to second. 

The freshman, Jimenez, has been 

impressive so far. Starting all 23 games 
this season — 14 at second, nine at 
shortstop — she’s racked up 12 runs, 
seven doubles, seven RBI and a home 
run while holding a .263 batting average. 
Three weeks ago, she was moved into 
the leadoff spot for her performance at 
the plate.

Rodriguez and Jimenez have similar 

fielding statistics and only one error 
each. Hutchins hasn’t answered why 
the switch took place, but in her world, 
no position is permanent. Currently, 
Jimenez is the starting shortstop and 
Rodriguez the starting second baseman, 
but it wouldn’t come as a surprise if 
Rodriguez won her spot back and the 
two swapped positions again.

Third base:
Third base, like first, has been a 

shared position for Michigan. 

Bump, who plays first and third, 

along with senior Madison Uden, 
have been the two Wolverines holding 
down the hot corner. Both are hitting 
on the lower end, and their overall 
offensive production is best described 
as lackluster. But so is the majority of 
the team’s — Michigan holds a collective 
.258 batting average — so although both 
are below the team average, neither are 
out of range of starting. The only player 
either is likely to lose playing time to is 
the other.

Take a step back from the door 

and you’ll see the boards that hang 
next to it with the names of All-Big 
Ten and All-American Michigan 
softball players. 

While each is a reminder of the 

greatness of the Michigan softball 
program as a whole, to me, the 
focus is much clearer.

It’s the faces that stand out. 
Looking at the 2005 poster I see 

Samantha Findley — the freshman 
who hit a three-run homer to win 
the 2005 World Series. On the 
boards next to the conference room 
door, I see Sierra Romero’s name, 
among Tera Blanco’s and Faith 
Canfield’s and the image of their 
faces immediately comes to mind.

They’re the players I followed on 

Instagram in seventh grade when I 
decided I wanted to be a Michigan 
softball player. They’re the girls 
I dressed up as for Halloween. 
They’re the older sisters I never 

had. They’re the role models I 
followed and aspired to be.

They’re the faces of Michigan 

softball and the legacy it boasts. 

But this year, it’s undetermined 

who that face will be.

Flash back to the start of the 

season, when a roster was first being 
determined. One can only imagine 
what flew through Michigan head 
coach Carol Hutchins’s head as she 
crafted her starting lineup. With 
the absence of five key seniors from 
last year, there was room for older 
players to finally get their shot, or 
for younger players to step up and 
shine. 

For many years the Wolverines 

were typically managed by one 
standout 
athlete. 
They’re 
the 

players you list off the top of your 
head. The ones Hutchins pencils 
into the lineup or trusts in the circle 
without hesitation.

While no one has emerged to 

carry that mantle this season, many 
have made their case.

After outfielder Lexie Blair’s 

breakout freshman season last year, 
it seemed straightforward to deem 
her the face of the team. But after a 
sophomore hitting slump that’s left 
her with a .307 batting average, a 
slip to second in the batting order, 
and just 11 runs scored over 23 
games so far — compared to her 
.406 and 42 runs, it’s hard to clearly 
determine that she’s the favorite for 
the role. 

Junior 
left-hander 
Meghan 

Beaubien also seemed like a clear 
choice. In years prior, Michigan 
has been known to have one ace — 
a pitcher that does the majority of 
the work, and controls the defense. 
Since 2004 (the furthest back stats 
go), with the exception of two 
seasons, Michigan has had a pitcher 
over 200 innings and below 2.00 
ERA. Instead, this year, Beaubien 
and sophomore right hander Alex 
Storako have been tag-teaming it, 
working together. Earlier in the 
season, Hutchins likened them to 
“co-aces.”

Roster Breakdown

Who is the face of the team?

When it’s 8 a.m. and freezing cold, 

there’s one person Donny Dreher can 
count on to be in the stands of a weekend 
tournament: Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins. 

Some college coaches don’t come out 

until 11:00 or noon, but when Hutchins 
is recruiting a player, she’s there for the 
first game. She wants all the information 
she can get. 

Dreher is a coach for Michigan 

Finesse — the top club team in the 
state — and knows how thorough 
Hutchins and the rest of her coaching 
staff like to be. “Thorough” is a word 
that’s thrown around a lot in reference 
to the Wolverines’ recruiting practices. 
They’re thorough in their search 
for prospective players, thorough in 
watching them develop throughout 
high school and thorough in making 
offers to the ones they really want.

Usually, the process starts in the 

middle of June when the coaching 
staff — Hutchins, associate coach 
Bonnie Tholl and assistant coach Jen 
Brundage — start traveling to massive, 
national tournaments to see the best 
players from across the country. There’s 
tedious online research of rankings and 
statistics. From there, club coaches try 
to identify the future Michigan players 
on their teams and point them to the 

Wolverines. 

Everyone has a different idea of the 

stereotypical Michigan recruit: big, 
strong players that can hit home runs; 
strong pitchers and defenders; athletic 
shortstops; a kid that can handle tough 
love. 

In Tholl’s perfect world, though, 

eight out of every 10 recruits would be 
a shortstop — the position she played 
for the Wolverines. They’re typically 
the most athletic on the team and 
can be easily moved around the field. 
According to Chez Sievers, a senior 
editor at FloSoftball, that’s common for 
the top collegiate programs. 

“They’re a five-tool athlete that can 

play multiple positions,” Sievers said. 
“They’ve got some speed. They’ve got 
power. They’ve got some versatility. 
They can also hit for average. For the 
top teams, they try to collect as many of 
those players as possible.”

At the same time, the Wolverines 

have to look at the team’s needs on a 
larger scale. Some years they’ll decide 
they need more speed. Others they’ll 
realize they lack power at the plate. The 
coaches keep a board in their office that 
lays it all out: what the team has and 
what positions it needs. 

After the team identifies what it’s 

looking for, the coaches start visiting the 
club facilities and contacting the players 
and their families, starting in the state of 
Michigan. 

The strategy makes the logistics 

easier for the Wolverines — they have 
stronger relationships with the clubs 
and can easily see players in person. 
Seven of the 20 players currently on the 
roster are in-state.

Bill Conroy, the head coach of the 

Beverly Bandits, has sent nine players 
through Michigan’s program. Between 
all three Wolverine coaches, they’ll 
come down to watch a player on his 
team an average of 12 times a year. 

“They do their due diligence more 

than most schools,” Conroy said. 
“Michigan wants to make sure they’ve 
got the right kid.”

Sometimes, Tholl will meet kids that 

just seem destined to be Wolverines, like 
sophomore catcher Hannah Carson. 

Carson is from Weidman and played 

club softball for Michigan Finesse. 
Tholl and the rest of the coaching staff 
watched her progress through high 
school, seeing her at tournaments and 
softball camps in Ann Arbor. When 
Carson started the recruiting process, 
she was sought out by several colleges, 
including other top programs like 
Florida State. In the end, though, she 
didn’t even visit. Tholl was right — she 
was meant to be a Wolverine. 

“I’ve always wanted to play here,” 

Carson said. “I grew up coming to the 
games, coming to all the camps and I 
really looked up to a lot of the players 
that played here before me. I would 

say in middle school, I started to get 
recruited by Michigan and then my 
freshman year is when I decided to 
commit, and it was the best feeling in 
the world.”

Carson committed in 2015, before 

NCAA regulations were put in place 
to stop early recruiting. Now, coaches 
can’t have direct contact with players 
until Sept. 1 of their junior year. Before 
the new regulations, teams felt like they 
had to make offers earlier and earlier 
to secure the players they wanted, and 
kids felt pressure to commit early or risk 
missing out.

But as recruiting occurred earlier and 

earlier, Michigan held its ground. 

“I would say Michigan in particular 

has really embraced the thorough 
process of evaluating their players,” 
Sievers said. “They didn’t really cave 
into the early recruiting. They waited, 
they wanted to see which kids really 
wanted to become Wolverines and 
would really fit their program.”

To some extent, Hutchins had to 

participate in the system. Several 
current players — including Carson 
— were recruited in ninth grade. But 
Hutchins was outspoken against the 
early recruiting practice and missed out 
on some top players. 

“We were able to make verbal offers 

to your firstborn that was six months 
old,” Hutchins said.

She believes that when players were 

recruited in ninth grade, they lost the 
incentive to keep improving. 

“It’s not because they don’t care,” 

Hutchins said. “Because they don’t 
know better. It doesn’t matter who’s the 
best in ninth grade. It matters who’s the 
best in college.”

Even though Carson was part of 

the early recruiting wave, she’s sure 
she made the right decision. But not 
everyone’s path is so linear. 

Sometimes, there are surprises along 

the way. Tholl didn’t first hear about 
sophomore right-hander Alex Storako 
on a rankings website or at a national 
tournament. It was in a text from her 
brother. 

You should take a look at this pitcher — 

she’s really good. 

At the time, Storako was playing on 

a high school team in central Illinois 
with Tholl’s niece. She’d already been 
recruited to play at DePaul, but Tholl 
still took an interest, following her and 
keeping tabs when her name showed 
up in The Chicago Sun-Times or the 
Chicago Tribune. Her name kept 
coming up, and it was fun to track her 
progress. 

One day, Tholl was running a camp in 

Peoria, Ill. when she got another text — 
this time from an unknown number.

Alex Storako, class of ’18 pitcher, has 

just decomitted from DePaul.

Bernie’: a call left 

Primary
election
edition


O

n Feb. 6, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 
D-Mass., made headlines when 
she announced she would not 

be attending the annual American Israel 
Public 
Affairs 
Committee 
(AIPAC), 

conference in Washington, D.C. Sen. Bernie 
Sanders, I-Vt., followed suit a few weeks 
later, citing concern “about the platform 
AIPAC provides for leaders who express 
bigotry and oppose basic Palestinian 
rights.” In late February, these candidates 
were also joined in their boycott by 
candidates Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., 
and former Mayor of South Bend, Indiana, 
Pete Buttigieg.

AIPAC advertises its mission as to 

“strengthen, protect and promote the 
United States-Israel relationship in ways 
that enhance the security of the United 
States and Israel.” Its conference, held each 
year in D.C., provides a space for speakers 
from around the world to speak, largely in 
defense of Israeli policies and U.S. support 
for Israel.

Democratic candidates saying “no” 

to AIPAC is a big deal. The mainstream 
Democratic party has not historically 
taken strong viewpoints regarding Israel/
Palestine policy — the default stance for 
prominent Democratic politicians has 
been to affirm American support for Israel 
and to support the establishment of a two-
state solution. In general, the Democratic 
party of the past two decades has branded 
itself as a primarily pro-Israel party.

This election cycle, however, progressive 

Democratic presidential candidates are 
breaking out of this mold. Warren and 
Sanders have both criticized Israeli military 
actions over the past few years; following 
a wave of violence in November of 2019, 
Sanders and Warren spoke out against the 
Israeli blockade of Gaza. Both candidates 
have 
also 
called 
for 
conditioning 

American military aid to Israel. And as 
the Washington Post reported, 2020 is 
the “first time top contenders — Sanders 
and Warren — have boycotted the massive 
American Israel Public Affairs Committee 
policy conference.”

This decision was wildly unpopular 

among many Jewish Americans. But it was 
also applauded by many, significantly by 
the liberal Jewish movement IfNotNow, 
which had done a lot of the organizing 
work through their #SkipAIPAC campaign 
that resulted in candidates boycotting the 
conference.

I fall into the latter camp of Jewish 

Americans, those who are happy to 
see candidates saying no to blind Israel 
support. But I didn’t always identify this 
way.

I grew up attending a reform synagogue 

in Southern California, with a circle of lefty-
ish Jewish family friends. My community 
didn’t talk about Israel/Palestine very 
much — my only concrete memory of 
anything vaguely controversial is my Rabbi 
making some general comment about the 
importance of peace and justice for all. 
The general understanding seemed to be 
that Israel was important, our connection 
to it as Jewish Americans was important, 
but we didn’t need to get too much into the 
weeds of the matter.

Therefore, I came to the University of 

Michigan not really having an idea of how 
I felt about Israel. I went to University of 
Michigan Hillel for Shabbat a few times. 
I heard my Jewish peers talk about how 
important Israel was to them, about 
how Palestinian student activists were 
motivated primarily out of anti-Semitism, 
about how it was necessary to shut 
down criticism of Israel at any possible 
opportunity.

This is what it meant to be Jewish, 

I figured. Being Jewish equated with 
supporting Israeli politics unequivocally, 
wholeheartedly, unabashedly. 

But something didn’t sit quite right with 

me. I’d read some articles on Palestinian 
movements, taken a class on the history of 
the Middle East. I couldn’t quite get behind 
the idea of supporting Israel at all costs, 
even at the expense of others — which I 
was deeply ashamed of. I thought to myself, 
I must just not be Jewish enough to fully 
get it. 

My 
Jewish 
upbringing 
had 
been 

unconventional, this is true. My father was 
raised Catholic, and my mother, despite 
being ethnically Jewish, was raised almost 
entirely secular. It wasn’t until later in 
life that she started actively practicing — 
formulating a Jewish community around 
her, hosting Passover Seders, lighting the 
candles for Shabbat on Friday nights. So, I 
didn’t grow up with passed-down recipes 
for matzo ball soup or a traditional challah 
cover. My family learned traditions from 
our Jewish family friends, adopting new 
ones, slowly recreating a sense of Jewish 
identity for ourselves.

For a long time, this was something I 

was immensely insecure 
about, 
especially 
when 

surrounded by my peers 
who 
had 
attended 

Jewish 
day 
school 

their whole lives, and who 
had 
grandparents 
and 

great-grandparents sitting 
around the table with them 
at the Seder table every 
year.

It wasn’t until I met 

other 
young 
Jewish 

students who felt uneasy 
about Israeli politics that I 
realized I wasn’t alone. The 
realization that there were 
young people out there 
who both cared deeply 
about being Jewish and 
felt uncomfortable with 
the unconditional support 
of the state of Israel was 
huge for me. Sophomore 
year, an organizer from J 
Street — an organization 
that promotes itself as simultaneously 
supporting Israeli and Palestinian rights — 
asked me to grab coffee. When she told me 
about her views on Israel/Palestine, and 
how for her, being Jewish made her want 
to make the state of Israel better — I cried.

I realized that having doubts about 

Israel didn’t make me less Jewish. In 
fact, perhaps my Jewish values were 
the very reason I harbored doubts about 
unconditional support for Israel. My 
Jewish community taught me to think 
critically, to ask questions, to not accept 
stories at face value. The history of Judaism 
is a history of arguing and questioning; 
about how to interpret the Torah and how 
to live one’s life.

My Jewish community also taught me 

to value empathy and support for other 
people. One of my strongest memories of 
Hebrew School growing up is the emphasis 
on tikkun olam, or “repair the world.” To 
be Jewish, I was taught, was to make the 
world better for everyone, not just the 
Jewish people.

This is why I’m glad that by mainstream 

candidates 
denouncing 
AIPAC, 
the 

Democratic Party seems to be moving 
in a new direction — a direction that 
acknowledges 
the 
American 
Jewish 

community is by no means a monolith. 
A direction that can at once take into 

account the significance Israel carries as 
a stronghold of Jewish identity for many 
Jewish Americans while also calling out 
the nation when it enacts policies or takes 
military actions that threaten Palestinian 
human rights.

As of Warren’s exit from the 2020 

presidential race, Sanders remains the 
lone Democratic candidate willing to bring 
these conversations to a national stage. 
He is also a proud Jewish American — 
something he doesn’t hesitate to talk about. 
Seeing Sanders simultaneously defend 
his Jewish heritage and his support for 
Palestinian human rights gives me hope 
for the future of the American Jewish 
community and the Democratic party.

I still think the Democratic party 

has a long way to go. I would love to 
see politicians explicitly calling Israeli 
presence in the West Bank and Gaza 
occupation 
and 
vocally 
opposing 

settlement expansion (a campaign that 
J-Street affiliated students are working on 
across the country). But I’m happy that we 
seem to be making some progress, however 
small it might be.

O

ne of the most dangerous ideas 
in (Washington) is that Don-
ald Trump is a break from the 

status quo, rather than a product of the 
status quo,” said Matt Duss at the For-
eign Policy-Quincy Institute Forum a 
few weeks ago. Duss, the current foreign 
policy advisor to Democratic presiden-
tial candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., 
has become an increasingly well-known 
figure in the United States foreign policy 
establishment. His unconventional rise to 
a top aide of a serious presidential hopeful 
fully embodies the grassroots direction of 
Sanders’s politics.

Moreover, Duss’s positioning of Sand-

ers as a maverick foreign policy candidate 
sets him apart from previous Beltway out-
siders like former deputy national security 
adviser Ben Rhodes, who rode his speech-
writer position with then-presidential 
candidate Barack Obama to a senior role. 
Rhodes served in an administration that, 
to many progressives, perpetuated many 
previous foreign policy excesses. Sand-
ers, on the other hand, has plainly called 
for a reimagining of the traditionally real-
ist foundations of international relations. 
At a rally five months ago, he challenged 
the very idea of nationalism and sover-
eignty when he asked the crowd, “Are you 
willing to fight for that person who you 
don’t even know as much as you’re willing 
to fight for yourself?”

But Duss is not just an interesting 

character who distinguishes Sanders 
from Obama or the apparent successor 
of Obama’s legacy, Democratic front-run-
ner and former 
Vice Presi-

dent Joe Biden. He helps visualize the 
radically different way of governing Sand-
ers has in mind for America. But, through 
Sanders’s and Biden’s fight for the chance 
to beat President Donald Trump in the 
upcoming presidential election, many are 
making the mistake of viewing Sanders 
as merely a further-left version of Biden. 
Even more off-the-mark are those who 
compare Biden and Sanders as recurring 
characters in a political play, the Demo-
cratic versions of the Republican Party 
establishment and Trump, respectively, 
in 2016. 

The reality contains much more con-

trast and nuance. Looking at Sanders’s 
and Biden’s respective approaches to 
foreign policy can help understand their 
perspectives on the international role of 
the U.S. for America and their respective 
appeals to the electorate.
T

he establishment has tended 
to view Trump’s approach to 
the world as anomalous. Sand-

ers breaks with that by deriding cur-
rent U.S. foreign policy as more of the 
same. Trump came into office talking a 
big game about reducing America’s mili-
tary footprint, but time and time again 
he has ramped up military involve-
ment and assistance. Likewise, progres-
sives have often critiqued Obama for 
inspiring hope as a candidate, promis-
ing to disengage from Iraq and roll back 
the post-9/11 security state, only to expand 
America’s military footprint as president. 
In this view, this status quo of inertial 
military overreach stretches back further 
to Presidents George W. Bush and Bill 
Clinton. Sanders would approach his own 
presidency as an overhaul, not a reform, of 
this status quo. He wants to walk the walk 
where others have failed.

Biden, meanwhile, is mostly com-

fortable going back to what is tried and 
tested. And that pitch has its appeal. 
Trump has gutted the State Department, 
held longstanding alliances and secu-
rity arrangements at gunpoint, exit-
ed or threatened to exit crucial agreements 
and otherwise damaged U.S. standing. 
Biden aims to convince voters that going 
back to the status quo — no matter how 
flawed it was — would in most respects be 
a welcome relief. 

To be sure, Biden has explicitly dis-
avowed the neoliberal trade policies 

proved politically toxic by the 2016 
election. But his support for increas-
ing the military budget and maintain-
ing troop deployments in the Middle 
East is, to many disillusioned progres-
sives, an Obama foreign policy redux. 
To them, Biden simply recalls Rhodes, 
who represented the anti-establish-
ment promises of Obama, only to jus-
tify drone strikes that killed innocent 

civilians and push progressives to ques-
tion if he was really that different from 
the establishment. Those progressives 
find their faith in Sanders.

Talk to some of his strongest support-

ers, and you come away believing that 
Sanders’s end goal is a U.S. foreign policy 
completely remade in a humanitarian, 
socialist mold. University of Michigan 
sophomore Noah Streng, vice president of 
Young Democratic Socialists of America 
at the University and a campus organizer 
for Sanders’s campaign, said he is drawn 
to Sanders in part because of his vision for 
a compassionate and diplomacy-centered 
U.S. foreign policy. There is nothing radi-
cal about those premises at first glance: 
George W. Bush paraded the idea of “com-
passionate conservatism” on his cam-
paign, and before Trump, diplomacy was 
a near-bipartisan centerpiece of postwar 
U.S. foreign policy.

But fully employing these premises, 

or changing their definitions, would be 
radical. Compassion, when called on 
to help faraway peoples or topple bru-
tal regimes, has often led to political 
disaster and so been disavowed when 
convenient by presidents from Clin-
ton to Obama. And diplomacy, while sorely 
lacking under the current administration, 
has been traditionally employed to serve 
national interests only. Sanders wants to 
change all that.

Streng strongly believes this concept 

is as much a pillar of Sanders’s domestic 
promises, such as universal healthcare 
and an increased minimum wage, as it is a 
call to the workers of the world to unite. If 
the Michigan auto worker and Iranian oil 
worker realize they have more in com-
mon with each other than with their 

respective billionaire compatri-

ots, the thinking goes, 

then they have 

realized 

their 
“com-
mon 
humanity.” From 
that, a more peaceful, pros-
perous future is possible. 
If Sanders had reached the 
presidency and was able to 
see that promise through, it 
would be nothing less than a 
full transition to a socialist 
foreign policy.

Discerning the two can-

didates’ 
foreign 
policies 

helps 
dispel 
misconcep-

tions 
about 
their 

promises for America 

more broadly. On the world stage, Sand-
ers wants to approach what has long been 
a nationalist global order through a mate-
rialist lens. Common interests of working 
people, not interstate competition, would 
animate his foreign policy. At a rally in the 
Diag on Sunday, he said, “Maybe instead 
of spending $1.8 trillion a year on weap-
ons of destruction, killing each other, (we 
should) fight our common enemy, which is 
climate change.” For him, foreign policy 
is less a separate venue for pursuing paro-
chial national interests, as it would be for 
a staunch non-interventionist than it is a 
way to generally promote human welfare 
— and not just for Americans.

This is apparent not only in Sand-

ers’s past support for humanitarian mili-
tary intervention where American vital 
interests were not at play, but also in the 
words of his endorsers. State Rep. Yousef 
Rabhi, D-Ann Arbor, who spoke before 
Sanders at the rally on Sunday, endorsed 
a decidedly socialist foreign policy when 
he exclaimed “I want a president who will 
stand up for people all over the world.” 
That reflects Sanders’s larger desire to do 
away with existing assumptions about the 
world — not just tackle crises on an ad hoc 
basis. That is either incredibly brave or 
foolishly cocky, depending on where you 
stand. Fellow progressive and Sanders 
endorser Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 
D-N.Y., captured this systematic aspira-
tion when she said “Our priority is not 
only defeating Donald Trump. It’s defeat-
ing the system of which he is a symptom.”

S

enator Bernie Sanders lowered 
the microphone from his mouth 
to his hip, meandered over to the 

right side of the podium and looked out 
over the crowd packed into the Diag. 
The sun was just peeking from the 
tops of the Hatcher Graduate Library. 
Sanders stood there, holding his voice 
and his body still for nearly 10 seconds. 

He lifted his right arm, paused again, 

and unfurled one of his favorite lines:

“Nelson 
Mandela, 
one 
of 
the 

great heroes in modern history, said 
something that was very profound and 
appropriate for today. And he said, 
‘Everything seems impossible until it 
is done. Everything seems impossible 
until it is done.’ ” 

He continued: “In other words, if we 

were here 70 years ago and somebody 
said, ‘You know what? The day will come 
that we’ll have an African American 
President, people would’ve said ‘Don’t 
be ridiculous. Don’t be crazy, it’ll never 
happen. America is too racist a country. 
The day will come when gay marriage 
will be legal in America – ‘Don’t be 
crazy. That will never happen.’ The 
day will come when we have women 
governors and Senators all over this 
country — ‘Don’t be crazy. That can’t 
happen.’ ”

The crowd gained energy with each 

repetition.

Sanders went on to name major 

hurdles in this contemporary struggle 
for equality: Wall Street, insurance 
companies, drug companies, the fossil 
fuel industry, among other regular 
punching bags on the campaign trail.

“But, you know what, they are not 

the major impediment to progress,” 
he said. “The major impediment is the 
limitations of our own imagination.”

Sanders’s voice bellowed with a 

trademark fervor. The moment marked 
a tenuous one in the Sanders campaign, 
mere days after the axis on which his 
candidacy rested turned on its head. The 
Michigan primary, to be contested three 
days later, had suddenly heightened in 
urgency.

His speech came on the heels of an 

unexpected blow on Super Tuesday — 
one which saw former Vice President 
Joe Biden, perhaps improbably, lift 
his campaign from its depths to win 

10 of 14 states. Biden won seven of 
those states by double-digit margins, 
including Virginia and Alabama, which 
he won by 30 and 47 points, respectively. 
Those margins helped boost his lead 

in total delegates to 82, and spurred 
his projection in the FiveThirtyEight 
Democratic Primary Forecast to an 
89 percent chance to win a majority of 
pledged delegates. 

Sanders spent the days prior to 

Tuesday’s primary careening around the 
state, from Flint to Dearborn to Grand 
Rapids. It was announced only late 
Saturday evening that Sanders would be 
joined in Ann Arbor by Rep. Alexandria 
Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., undeniably his 
most popular surrogate among the Gen 
Z crowd. Together, they spent much 
of Sunday speaking to their plan: to 
reconfigure what is and isn’t possible in 
American politics through a resurgent, 
energized base of younger voters.

The symmetry of that relationship 

— the youngest member of Congress 
aligned with one of its oldest — conveys 
a degree of clarity about the democratic 
socialist movement and the sanctity of 
its moral convictions. It weaves a tale of 
resilience and longevity, perseverance 
and vision.

We hope this is the present, but it’s 

most definitely the future. Get on board 
or be left behind. 

“(Sanders) stands for what I think 

(is) 
right 
... 
both 
politically 
and 

morally,” LSA freshman James Aidala, 
a leader among the Students for Bernie 
organization at Michigan, told The 
Daily. “I think that everyone should 
have health care. Everyone should have 

a wage that they can live off of, if they 
work a full 40 hours a week. So he just 
speaks to me on basically, you know, all 
kinds of levels, that he is somebody who 
can run the country the right way.”

What’s 
left 
unsaid 
in 
Sanders’s 

invocations of Mandela is that in order 
to truly reconfigure the structure of 
American society, Sanders — or someone 
of his ideology — must first ascend 
to those positions of power like the 
presidency. Idealism without requisite 
authority can only go so far.

Through that lens, Sanders’s 14-point 

loss three days later to Biden in Michigan, 
a bellwether state in both the primary 
and the general election, reflected an 
electorate increasingly unwilling to 
take those leaps. According to exit polls 
in Michigan, Biden won a majority of 
white voters and a majority of Black 
voters. He won among voters with an 
advanced degree and he won amongst 
those without a college degree. Ninety-
four percent of voters said they’d trust 
Biden in a crisis. He won union voters. 
He won voters who said healthcare was 
their most important issue. The win was 
diverse and thorough.

And one statistic told the tale of the 

night and the entire cycle: Among voters 
under 30, 82 percent supported Sanders. 
Among voters 65 and over, 73 percent 
supported Biden. 

The former category accounted for 

just 15 percent of all voters. The latter 
made up 23 percent.
I

n the cool Ann Arbor air on 
Sunday, 
a 
protester 
walked 

around the Sanders rally holding 

a large sign reading “Every Socialist is 

a Dictator”. Clad in a top that said, “The 
Anti-Socialist Social Club”, he engaged 
some rally attendees in debate. 

Many Republicans today liken Sanders 

to Fidel Castro and Hugo Chavez, 

pointing to their 

policies in Cuba 
and Venezuela. 
Among 
Democrats, the 
fear of electoral 
repercussions 
ignites a craving 
for pragmatism 
— 
a 
trait 

antithetical 
to 

Sanders’s zero-
sum approach.

In 
a 
July 

2019 
speech 

at 
George 

Washington University, Sanders likened 
his democratic socialist vision to that of 
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s 
New Deal in the 1930s. In doing so, 
Sanders tried to counter the Republican 
portrayal of “socialism” as taboo, a 
tactic that’s been used for decades. 
Roosevelt did not define himself as a 
socialist but Sanders has self-identified 
as a democratic one for the majority of 
his career. During his speech, Sanders 
referenced Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.: 
“This country has socialism for the rich, 
rugged individualism for the poor” a 
line used to dispute the depictions of 
him as a radical and emphasize the class 
disparity central to his campaign. Still, 
the 
long 
negative 
connotation 
of 

socialism in the United States begs 
the question as to whether Sanders 
can win the presidency — let alone the 
nomination — as a democratic socialist. 
Whether the stigma alone is too much to 
overcome.

But, perhaps spurred by Sanders’s 

national rise over the past five years, the 
tides of that perception are changing.

In 2018, more Democrats had a positive 

view of socialism than had a positive 
view of capitalism according to Gallup, 
with 57 percent of Democrats holding a 
positive view of socialism and 47 percent 
holding a positive view of capitalism. But 
this shift in opinion among Democrats 
doesn’t translate to a shift among the 
public as a whole. In a 2019 poll, the Pew 

Research Center found that 55 percent 
of Americans overall have a negative 
view of socialism, with 42 percent 
having a positive view. However, this is 
an increase since 2012, when 60 percent 
had a negative view of socialism and 
only 31 percent had a positive reaction — 
an increase likely owed to Sanders and 
his rise. 

The classic 18-29 age group has the 

most positive view of socialism, with 
50 percent labeling socialism as either 
“very positive” or “somewhat positive.” 
This is the group Sanders courts most 
often. LSA sophomore Anna Nedoss, 
a leading organizer with Students for 
Bernie, detailed Sanders’s operation: a 
summer and winter school for training 
students in the art of campaigning. Both 
schools were aimed at teaching students 
how to organize their college campuses 
and build support for Sanders. The 
program was the only one of its kind in 
the Democratic field. 

As mentioned, Sanders leans heavily 

on those who buy into his brand 
of democratic socialism the most: 
millennials and the Gen-Z generation. 

Aidala chuckled when asked what 
democratic socialism means to him. 

“Sorry, it’s just everyone keeps asking 

that,” he followed. “It’s to make people’s 
lives better. It is to help our most 
vulnerable wherever we can … you can 
call it what you want, but a lot of people 
could use health care and education 
right now. So if that’s socialism, or that’s 
bananas, either way. I like both.” 

In each interview with a Students for 

Bernie leader, Marx and Lenin were 
not brought up. Socialism in Venezuela 
and Cuba was not held up as shining 
examples — no expropriation of land, no 
nationalizing of oil companies, no price 
controls. For LSA freshman Alex Nobel, 
another leader in Students for Bernie, 
it was simple and succinct: “My view 
of democratic socialism is government 
helping people, instead of corporations, 
putting working people ahead of the 
rich.” These descriptions of democratic 
socialism and its policies sound akin to 
Roosevelt’s New Deal policies — which 
Sanders would be happy about — rather 
than policies of politicians like Chavez 
and Castro.

But this heavy lean on young voters 

to advance the ideals of democratic 
socialism to the White House is unstable. 
During Super Tuesday, turnout among 
voters under 30 didn’t top 20 percent 
across the 14 states voting. That’s 
unworkable and is likely a major factor 
behind Sanders’s tepid Super Tuesday 
result. Sanders needs to add more voters 
over 50 to the bandwagon — voters that 
consistently turn up and vote. But that 
demographic isn’t too positive about 
socialism: 38 percent of 50-64-year-olds 
and 35 percent of those over 65 think 
positively about it. 

Seemingly, it’s the label alone that’s 

holding him back. The democratic 
socialism umbrella of policies includes 
such trademarks as Medicare for All, 
the Green New Deal and free college. 
Those policies are widely popular 
among Democrats according to a Marist 
poll. Sixty-four percent say Medicare 
for All is a good idea, 86 percent say the 
Green New Deal is good and 76 percent 
like free public college, too. Yet Sanders, 
who is the only candidate left touting 
these policies, lost 10 states on Super 
Tuesday to Biden, who supports none 
of these policies. Ray, a longtime Ann 
Arbor resident, made plans to vote for 
Sanders: “I don’t think Bernie’s about 
socialism at all. I really, I very much 
doubt it. There’s no way Americans 
would do socialism.” While Ray sees 
through the stereotype of the word and 
supports single-payer healthcare and 
free education for those who want it, 
the Democratic establishment doesn’t 
seem to think the rest of the public can 
— at least in numbers that could win an 
election. 

But 
that 
generational 
disparity 

still represents the central chasm in 
the Democratic Primary, a numbers 

game that leaves Sanders’s bet to turn 
out young voters in unprecedented, 
revolutionary 
numbers 
increasingly 

flimsy. 
The 
latest 
poll 
from 

Quinnipiac 
highlighted 
that 
gulf 

between older and younger voters. 
Nationally, 80 percent of those over 65 
support Biden and 71 percent of those 
under 35 support Sanders. Based on 
turnout numbers, Sanders’s lone hope 
at reclaiming momentum and any 
feasible path to the nomination requires 
bridging that gap.

As rally-goers and pedestrians filed 

in and out of the Diag, some heading 
out of the chilly evening before the end 
of Sanders’s remarks, a voice yelled 
out above the fray with one parting 
message: “Tell your grandparents to 
vote for Bernie.” 
A

fter 
all 
the 
pomp 
and 

circumstance of the last week 
— Sanders parading around 

the state for days, staking the future of 
his campaign on an upset in Michigan 
— NBC News called the state for Biden 
shortly after 9 p.m. Tuesday night. 
Neither candidate offered a speech, 
precautions taken to combat fears over 
Coronavirus. 

Many prognosticators used Michigan 

as the final nail in the Sanders 
campaign’s coffin, some pronouncing 
the nomination of Biden a foregone 
conclusion.

It also offered an indirect indictment 

of Sanders, who defied the polls to win 
the Michigan Primary in 2016. 

In some ways, the bleak outlook 

makes the dynamics of Sunday’s speech 
on the Diag even more pertinent. 
Ocasio-Cortez, likely the future of the 
democratic socialist movement, pre-
empting Sanders’s speech.

Standing near the steps to Hatcher 

Graduate 
Library, 
Ocasio-Cortez 

referenced a 1984 speech by Rev. 
Jesse Jackson, who had recently 
endorsed the Sanders campaign. The 
younger cohort of students stood 
closer to the stage. Many of the older 
attendees held back beyond the fence, 
listening from afar.

“Michigan, we have goliaths in our 

country today,” Ocasio-Cortez said, 
amid fervent roars. “The goliath of 
the fossil fuel industry. The goliath 
of big pharma. The goliath of the role 
of big money in politics. These are 
powerful, powerful forces. And we 
are David. We are David. David, all of 
us, the little guys.” 

Then she offered a warning to the 

movement, one which superseded 
the here and now of Bernie Sanders 
and the presidential race.

“What David had to do before he 

confronted Goliath was to shed his 
unnecessary clothes,” she said. “... 
Because in order for us to grow, well 
rather in order for us to win, we have 
to grow. We have to grow. We must 
be inclusive. We must bring more 
people into this movement.”

A

t events across the country, 
from Iowa to Arkansas to 
Nevada to California, Sen. Eliz-

abeth Warren, D-Mass., ends each night 
by taking a selfie with every person who 
wants one, often snapping hundreds of 
photos — which, including a moment to 
talk to each supporter, runs for several 
hours. Each time a little girl reaches the 
front of the line and walks up to take her 
selfie, Warren bends down and says, “My 
name is Elizabeth, and I’m running for 
president because that’s what girls do,” 
then offers her pinkie so they’ll promise to 
remember it.

When asked about these now-famous 

pinkie promises, Sen. Warren recalls her 
first run for the United States Senate: 
People encouraged her to run, but admit-
ted they thought it was unlikely a woman 
could win against a male incumbent. Feel-
ing frustrated with sexist remarks about 
her hair and her clothes and her voice, she 
began making these pinkie promises with 
little girls. She said, “It matters a lot to me 
that little girls see themselves as future 
presidents of the United States.” 

Every time I see a picture of War-

ren down on one knee, pinkie promising 
another young girl that running for presi-
dent is what girls do, I feel a combination 
of affection, tenderness and I’ll admit, a 
bit of jealousy. How I wish I could be one 
of those little girls, intertwining my pin-
kie and promising to do what girls do with 
Elizabeth Warren. 

My first memory of an American presi-

dential campaign is from when I was 

about their age. It must have been early 
June 2008 because then-Sen. Barack 
Obama, D-Ill., had just secured a major-
ity of delegates to become the nominee. 
In the spring and summer of that year, I 
would have been about to turn 10 years 
old. I remember sitting in our living room 
while one of my parents was watching 
cable news, which, by that point, was plas-
tered with coverage of the Democratic 
primary. Though I knew little about the 
candidates or their policies at the time, 
I can still recall the visceral anger I felt, 
red hot right in my belly, when someone 
explained that this meant Hillary Clinton 
would not be president. 

I wasn’t old enough to know anything 

about the policy differences between 
Obama and Clinton, and I was sheltered 
enough that I didn’t realize that Obama’s 
nomination was also historic and what it 
would mean to a lot of people — includ-
ing me. Down the line, I could understand 
how important Obama’s presidency was 
for the forward progress of our country 
and how his legislative accomplishments 
would directly affect my life (by expand-
ing healthcare to millions of Americans, 
banning insurance companies from deny-
ing coverage to those with preexisting 
conditions and allowing young people to 
stay on their parent’s health insurance 
until 26, he personally improved my life as 
a person with a chronic illness). All I knew 
then was that it really, really mattered to 
me to see someone like me gain the con-
fidence of the nation and ultimately stand 
on the East Portico of the U.S. Capitol, 

right hand raised, swearing 
an oath to the Constitution 
and becoming the President 
of the United States. 

My anger then may have 

been a little misguided, but 
the place it came from wasn’t 
wrong. Look where we are 
now: It’s 12 years later and 
the two front-runners in the 
2020 Democratic primary 
are two rich, heterosexual, 
able-bodied white men in 
their 70s, to say nothing 
of the traumatic, decisive 
misogyny that was rampant 
in the 2016 election. 

At 21 years of age, I’ve 

only ever voted for a woman 
for president of the United 
States. It meant so incred-
ibly much to me, and to mil-
lions of young women across 
the country, to cast my first-
ever vote for president for a 
woman candidate — not just 
because she is a woman but 

because she was an incredibly 

qualified, smart and passionate nominee. I 
imagine it felt similar to how Black people 
felt casting their vote for Obama for presi-
dent or how LGBTQIA+ Americans felt 
casting their vote for former-South Bend 
Mayor Pete Buttigieg, the first openly-gay 
presidential candidate.

The 2020 Democratic primary began as 

the most diverse field of candidates to run 
for president ever, which was made possi-
ble, in part, by both Obama’s and Clinton’s 
candidacies. We had Kamala and Julián 
and Cory and Amy and Kristen and Eliza-
beth and Pete and Andrew. For the most 
part, it wasn’t just tokenism — there were 
multiple candidates of color and multiple 
women filling various different ideologi-
cal lanes. Of course, Buttigieg was the 
lone gay candidate, but it seems likely his 
historic candidacy will open the doors for 
many after him. 

Now, though, the field has been whit-

tled down to two candidates who offer the 
least diversity and hold identities with the 
most social power and privilege. We can 
and do talk about their policy positions or 
their experience or their age or their abil-
ity to do the job, but for just a moment, we 
should reflect on the candidates them-
selves, particularly their identities. 

Of course, all Democrats want to beat 

Donald Trump in November, but when the 
conversation about how to win revolves 
around how to appeal to some imaginary 
white male conservative voter in Wiscon-
sin, this framing of electability — which is 
based on the same biases that elected the 
first 44 white male American presidents 

— has deeply hurt every candidate who is 
not white and not male. It is profoundly 
disappointing and frankly disheartening 
to see so many people retreat to their com-
fort candidate — i.e., a heterosexual, white 
male — when things get tough. It indicates 
the weakness of so-called allyship and 
demonstrates an easy willingness to aban-
don non-white, non-male, non-hetero-
sexual candidates when it comes down to 
the wire. It is not the progressivism we’ve 
been promised. 

When making the argument for a 

woman candidate, a woman of color can-
didate, a gay candidate and so on, many 
will toss accusations of playing identity 
politics (something that somehow only 
applies to people who aren’t heterosex-
ual white men). If you support a woman 
candidate and like the fact that she’s a 
woman, other candidates’ supporters will 
call you a “vagina voter”. To some, it is 
unimaginable that anyone identifying as 
female might be capable of making a ratio-
nal choice, even when it results in choos-
ing someone who looks like them, and that 
holding a marginalized identity might 
actually be a valuable quality when run-
ning on a platform of working for those 
who have been left behind by the status 
quo.

In my case, my support for Elizabeth 

Warren in the primary was not based 
on the fact that she’s a woman (though it 
wouldn’t be bad if it was!). While I see the 
fact that she’s a woman as an incredible 
bonus, I supported her primarily based on 
the fact that she committed to getting rid 
of the Senate filibuster, something which 
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has and says he 
will not. The filibuster requires 60 votes, 
which the Democrats don’t have, to pass 
any form of universal healthcare. As a 
chronically-ill person in desperate need 
of accessible healthcare, I want the candi-
date who not only has the best policy, but 
also the best plan to get it passed. 

Alternatively, others will accuse you 

of prioritizing representation instead 
of actual progress. Beside perpetuat-
ing a foolish brand of tokenism, this idea 
that increased representation — having 
women, people of color, disabled people, 
indigenous people and queer people at the 
table making decisions — doesn’t matter is 
simply wrong, for two major reasons.

When will America be ready for her?

BY ELI RALLO, STATEMENT COLUMNIST

I

n 2016, I voted for President of the United States 
for the first time. I remember walking to my poll-
ing place in Ann Arbor, Michigan as a freshman 

in college, and waiting in line with a feeling of thrill in 
my chest. As I walked toward the booth I felt a bit of 
hesitance — almost as though I didn’t have the agency 
to cast my own vote, and thought back to the times my 
brothers and I would file in after my mother to watch her 
vote in the town hall in our hometown of Fair Haven, 
New Jersey. I thought back further to the women who 
fought for me to have this privilege today, how it wasn’t 
always given at the age of 18. I looked down at the ballot 
for the highest office in American politics, old enough to 
make my own vote, all alone, and had the privilege to see 
a woman’s name printed clearly on the ballot alongside 
then-nominee and current Republican President Donald 
Trump. 

In plain writing, there it was: history.
Seeing a woman represented on a major political bal-

lot shouldn’t have to feel surprising, exciting or exhaust-
ing, but it does — it did. Former Secretary of State 
Hillary Clinton, who faced harassment and targeted 
gender attacks throughout her campaign, beat Trump 
in the national popular vote by nearly 2.9 million votes, 
but ultimately lost the presidency by 77 votes in the Elec-
toral College. Clinton had numerous qualifications for 
the presidency, such as her Senate seat, position as U.S. 
Secretary of State and her work as First Lady, but in the 
aftermath of the election, many argued that despite her 
popular vote win, America wasn’t ready for Hillary — or 
any female president. 

Perhaps it seems like a no-brainer that most women 

gravitated toward Hillary Clinton as their choice in 2016, 
but this was not the case. According to an Edison Nation-
al Election Poll run in 2016, just over 50 percent of white 
women with a college degree voted for Clinton in 2016 — 
not really an overwhelming win. This is in large part due 
to white women, as 61 percent of non-college educated 
white women and 44 percent of college-educated white 
women voted for Trump. 

Among women of color, only 3 percent of non-college 

educated African American women and 25 percent of 
non-college educated Hispanic women voted for him. 77 
percent of nonwhite percent of college-educated women 
of color voted for Hillary Clinton — much more than col-
lege-educated white women. 

The support for Trump from white women has 

been analyzed as arising from the white woman’s his-
toric loyalty to the right, their privilege in being able to 
support a male, Republican president, and the power 
their whiteness has. Moreover, and among women and 
men alike, there was the underlying anxiety of trusting 
a woman in power, regardless of her qualifications. For 
some women, electing a female president is secondary to 
winning the election — beating Trump comes first. Oth-
ers simply cannot see a woman in such a high position of 
power. In 2016, studies showed that Clinton’s gender had 
a huge impact on her loss, with people going so far as to 
say “she doesn’t have a presidential look.”

Structural gender bias and the Clinton campaign’s 

steady uphill battle against gender discrimination and 
sexism made it ridiculously difficult for a victorious elec-
tion. By way of analyzing slogans like “Trump that Bitch,” 
the criticism Hillary faced for not smiling (or smiling 
too much) and a fear of the subordination of Trump by a 
woman, it is clear that Hillary’s gender was used against 
her throughout the 2016 election, and Trump’s was not. 
This led to a stark double standard. Clinton was berated 
for matters that Trump was not: While people criticized 
Clinton’s use of private emails, they barely questioned 
Trump’s involvement in utilizing a private email for work 
himself. The bias deficit made it immensely more difficult 
for Hillary, or any woman, to be elected over a straight 
man. 

Despite all the possibilities to Clinton’s 2016 loss, there 

befalls a valid and important question, arguably the most 
telling one: Would those who voted for Donald Trump 
have been more likely to vote for Hillary Clinton if she 
were a man?

Following the election, there was a deflated feeling 

among Clinton’s supporters and those who hoped for the 
first female president to dismantle the historical norm 

and superior electability of male presidents. Despite the 
hope for many that a woman would make her way into the 
White House in 2020, All in Together’s 2019 poll found 
that both Democratic and Republican voters predicted a 
male Democratic nominee — not a female one — would 
win against Trump in 2020. They saw hope in the pros-
pect of a male Democratic candidate and feared another 
apparent expected loss by a Democratic woman. Now, 
with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, as the last woman in 
the race and polling extremely low, it’s apparent the next 
President will indeed be a man.

As America readjusted in the weeks after Trump’s 

election and subsequent inauguration, I wondered when 
Americans would vote a woman into office — with both a 
popular vote and overwhelming support of the Electoral 
College — if Hillary Clinton, a woman with accolades and 
throngs of experience, who many thought was a shoo-in, 
didn’t beat Donald Trump. I wondered if the fact that 
Hillary Clinton almost reached the Oval Office would 
ignite a fire in Americans to truly strive for a female 
presidency, or introduce a lackadaisical attitude about 
promoting a female president, coming off of the sting of 
Clinton’s loss. 

Despite the fact that the Democratic Party saw many 

women campaign throughout the 2020 Democratic pri-
mary election cycle, they also saw these women slowly 
drop out, due to lack of support or exhaustion of expenses. 
With the stakes high for the Democratic Party to defeat 
Trump in 2020, the mainstream conversation in the 
media has become less about breaking the White House’s 
glass ceiling, and more about getting a Democrat — any 
Democrat — in the Oval Office. The priority for Demo-
crats is turning the White House blue again, and both 
Democrats and Republicans alike have commented they 
don’t think a woman is the person for the job.

***
As Americans watched all six women face defeat, they 

have begun to analyze how these politicians’ shared 
identity as American women affected their likeability 
and campaign success during the primaries.

I wondered how college-aged, left-leaning women con-

sider their gender identity when selecting a candidate to 
vote for. And more specifically, how the candidate’s poli-
cies on women’s issues affect how young women voters 
consider them as viable options when voting. 

In the weeks prior to Super Tuesday, I spent time 

interviewing college-aged, left-leaning women from 
the University of Michigan. What I found, in talking to 
them, is that the rhetoric of candidates and their stances 
surrounding women and minorities is overwhelmingly 
important when selecting a politician to vote for — issues 
like a woman’s agency over her body, equal pay and 
foundational human rights. Voting, for these women, is 
extremely subjective based on their needs and preferenc-
es, yet all of them had astute opinions on Warren — the 
strongest female contender — her struggle for the nomi-
nation, and how her gender stood in her way. 

Theatre & Dance junior Emerson Smith voted for Ber-

nie Sanders on March 10, and leans strongly on policy 
when making a decision about who to vote for. I asked 
her what communities she identifies with within society, 
and how these groups affect her voting choices.
