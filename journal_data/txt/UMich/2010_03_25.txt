Charges
dropped in
Innocence
Clinic case

Provience outcome
is clinic's third major
exoneration since its
2009 founding
By JILLIAN BERMAN
and ELYANA TWIGGS
ManagingNews Editor and
Daily StaffReporter
University Innocence Clinic
officials announced yesterday
that the Wayne County Prosecu-
tor's Office has dropped its charg-
es against Dwayne Provience.
Provience, 36, was convicted
in 2001 of murdering Detroit resi-
dent Rene Hunter and was sent
to prison. In November 2009,
Provience was released from jail
after the Innocence Clinic was
able to prove that there was a lack
of evidence to convict him.
Earlier this year, the prosecu-
tion called for a retrial in the case,
which was scheduled for April 5.
But with yesterday's announce-
ment that the prosecution is
dropping the case due to a lack of
evidence, Provience will no lon-
ger have to face the retrial.
Accordingto aUniversitypress
release, the announcement is the
Innocence Clinic's "third major

exoneration since it was founded
in the winter of 2009."
Second-year Law student Brett
DeGroff, a student attorney with
the Innocence Clinic, said in an
interview last night that the reso-
lution of the case is "just because
(Provience) was completely inno-
cent all along."
"We're thrilled," DeGroff said.
"It's a huge event for Mr. Provi-
ence. Until today, the specter of
retrial was always kind of loom-
ing over him, he had the tether
on his ankle and he wasn't free to
come and go as he pleased."
University Law Prof. and Inno-
cence Clinic co-director David
Moran said in a press release that
in the more than one year that
the clinic has been working on
the case, they've gathered a great
deal of evidence proving Provi-
ence's innocence.
"We hope that, having found
that overwhelming evidence of
who the real killers are, the pros-
ecution will consider bringing to
justice the killer who is still out
there walkingthe streets," Moran
said in the release.
Provience said in the release
that he was appreciative of the
students in the Innocence Clinic.

Visit to state capital
highlighted the
importance of
undergrad research
By CAITLIN HUSTON
Daily StaffReporter
Speaking before Michigan
lawmakers yesterday, University

students said the answers to the
state's economic woes could come
from the innovations of under-
graduate research.
Twelve undergraduate students
from Michigan State University,
Wayne State University and the
University of Michigan - the
institutions that make up the Uni-
versity Research Corridor - were
chosen to present their research
to an audience of state legislators
at the capitol on Wednesday. The

Lansing
students, as well as other higher
education and state leaders, spoke
about the importance of research
to Michigan's economy.
Speakers at the event included
State Rep. Joan Bauer (D-Lan-
sing), MSU President Lou Anna
K. Simon, Jackie Jerome Marks,
a special advisor to Michigan's
governor, and Jeff Mason, execu-
tive director of the University
Research Corridor.

Students passing through the
Diag are accustomed to student
groups clamoring for their atten-
tion. In the past two days, the

Animal Liberation Project - a
four-day exhibition displaying
violent images of animal abuse
- took its turn, confronting pass-
ersby on their way to class.
Sponsored by People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals
2, a subset of PETA dedicated to
youth outreach, the exhibition,
which continues through today, is
made up-of large panels that com-
pare human suffering with the
mistreatment of animals.
Though no security issues have
arisen as the result of the exhibit

thus far, lab workers in biomedi-
cal animal labs were notified of
the event via e-mail and were told
to make sure all employees was in
the appropriate zones.
One panel titled "Born Into
Slavery" displayed an image of
child laborers alongside an image
of calves confined to veal crates.'
"Branded" - another panel -
showed images of both slaves and
cows being branded.

One Campaign

With ties to Nigeris and
Ltondon, One Csmpsign is an
internstionslly recognized non-
profit organization designed to
combat disease snd povercy in
Africs.
Stephsnie Psrrish, Public
Policy student and cu-chair
of One Campaign, helped to
establish a University chapter
of the organization last fall. The
group, she said, set nut to put
pressure on the United States to
provide additional aid to Africa
and inspire American college
students to take action on the
issue.
According to the One Cam-
paign's website, the group is a
"grassroots campaign and advo-
cacy organization hacked by
more than 2 million people." Ic
was co-founded by U2 frontman
Bono and other activists. The
group also works closely with

African policy makers, accord-
ingsto the wehsite.
"We want to act assa voice for
the people who are not heing
heard," Parrish said.
Parrish said she initially
joined One Campaign in search
of anew hobhy and glohal cause.
Many members in One Cam-
paign, she said, joined because
of personal ties to the social and
political issues targeted by the
group.
One Campaign has recently
joined tisc One Campus Chal-
lenge - a competition between
colleges nationwide designed
to raise awareness about global
poverty.
The competition, which
awards the winningaschool with
$10,000, awards points to each
college on the basis of its stu-
dent body's ability to campaign
against poverty. At the end of

the competition, the $10,000
first-place prize will be donated
to the college's non-profit orga-
nization of choice.
The University's chapter of
One Campaign, Parrish said,
plans to host events in an effort
to raise awareness of global
issues and involve students by
having them sign petitions and
write letters to Congress.
"This (competition) can bring
national recognition to the Uni-
versity of Michigan," said Par-
rish.
The University's chapter is
currently in second place overall
behind Missouri State Univer-
sity and has one more opportu-
nity to overtake the leader. The
final event will take place on
campus in two locations - the
Diag and East Quad residence
hail - on May 29.

NEWS BRIEFS
WASHINGTON
Obama seeks $2.8
billion for Haiti
President Barack Obama is ask-
ing Congress for $2.8 billion in
emergency funding for the recon-
struction effort in Haiti following
January's devastating earthquake.
The president's request comes
one week before a U.N. donors
conference March 31 in New York.
Haitian officials plan to ask for
$11.5 billion in reconstruction
assistance.
Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee Chairman John Kerry says
the Senate is close to introducing
legislation to meet Obama's request.
The Jan. 12 earthquake that
ravaged the capital of Port-
au-Prince killed an estimated
230,000 people and left more than
1 million homeless.
TRAVERSE CITY, Mich.
Granhoim scolds
AG Cox on health
care reform
Gov. Jennifer Granholm said
yesterday that Attorney Gen-
eral Mike Cox doesn't have legal
authority to put Michigan on
record as opposing the federal
health care overhaul.
Cox joined a dozen other Repub-
lican state attorneys general in
filing a lawsuit challenging the con-
stitutionality of the measure Presi-
dent Barack Obama signed into law
Tuesday. Granholm, a Democrat
and supporter of the health over-
haul, said Cox had overstepped his
bounds.
"His primary client as the attor-
ney general is the executive branch
of government," Granholm said
in an interview following a public
appearance in Traverse City. "And
no one in the executive branch has
authorized him to take this posi-
tion."
She described Cox's action as "a
political ploy" and noted he was
running for the GOP nomination
for governor.
In a letter to Cox released by the
governor's office, Granholm said
that under the Michigan Constitu-
tion, the governor's law enforce-
ment authority is "superior to that
of the attorney general" - the office
she held before her election as gov-
ernor in 2002.
WASHINGTON
Treaty to cut nukes
in Russia and U.S.
The U.S. and Russia reached a
breakthrough agreement yesterday
for a historic treaty to reduce the
nuclear arsenals of the former Cold
War rivals, the most significant pact
in a generation and an important
milestone in the decades-long quest
to lower the risk of global nuclear
war.
After long and trying nego-
tiations, President Barack Obama
and Russian President Dmitry
Medvedev are to sign the treaty
in two weeks in Prague, once final
technical details are worked out,
officials in Washington and Mos-

cow said. The accord is expected
to cut, the number of long-range
nuclear weapons held by each side
to about 1,500, and it raises hopes
for further disarmament in the
years ahead.
The deal is seen as sealing an
increased level of trust and coop-
eration between the U.S. and Rus-
sia, who possess the vast majority of
the world's nuclear arms and have
labored under strained relations in
recent years.
MELBOURNE, Austrailia
Officers' e-mails
under investigation
Up to 100 police officers in the
Australian state of Victoria are
under investigation over racist
e-mails that have been circulated in
the internal police e-mail system, a
top official said today.
Chief Commissioner Simon
Overland said the police ethical
standards department had found
multiple e-mails that were too
shockingto be released publicly.
He would not confirm the subject
matter of the emails but said some
were "extremely serious, some are
offensive" and raised questions
about some officers' suitability to
their jobs.
"If the Victorian public were
aware of the nature of that materi-
al, I believe that it's of such a nature
that it would cause -significant
concern within the Victorian com-
munity," Overland told Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio.

MSA
From Page 1A
nally voted for the person who
appeared first on the list, but that
when they went back to the ballot
the person in that slot at the top of
the list could have changed.
The problem was discovered
early this morning when students
reported problems with the site.
Just before 8 a.m., ITS officials
disabled the randomization fea-
ture to prevent further problems.
Turning off the randomization
feature means the same party
will appear at the top of the ballot
for each person who votes. How-
ever, Deshpande said the order
currently being used was chosen
at random.
Michael Benson, chair of the
MSA Rules and Elections Com-
mittee, said last night that it
seems unlikely that the random-
ization feature will be able to be
fixed and restored for the rest of
the current election. However,
he said he plans to meet with ITS
officials to further review the
problem after the election to pre-
vent a similar malfunction from
occurring in the next election.
Benson said approximately
1,000 students voted before the
randomization feature was dis-
abled this morning. However,
the issue affected only students
who revisited their ballot after
reviewing the ballot confirma-
tion page.
Benson said ITS was reaching
out to students last night who had
voted before 8 a.m. yesterday and
therefore may have experienced
problems. Those students will
receive an e-mail with a link to a
new, secure website that will allow
them to verify their ballot and
make any necessary corrections.
Students who do not visit the
website or change their ballot
will be assumed to have cast their
ballot properly and their votes
will still be counted, Benson
explained.
Benson stressed that though
ITS is able to pair a student's
unique name to their individual

ballot to recall who a student
voted for, the information is con-
fidential and is not shared with
anyone else. The information, he
said, is maintained specifically
for situations like this.
MForward Presidential Can-
didate Chris Armstrong told the
Daily last night he was dissatis-
fied with the problems on the vot-
ing website.
"I am very disappointed,"
Armstrong said, pointing out
that last fall the election website
crashed temporarily. "I think the
fact that a similar glitch occurred
this year is just very frustrating
because it shows that these prob-
lems aren't being fixed, that there
isn't proper oversight or mainte-
nance of a simple thing like the
voting website."
MVP Presidential Candidate
Ian Margolis said in a statement
last night that he was disappoint-
ed with the technical voting dif-
ficulties.
"It is unacceptable that this
issue arose, especially because
every student has the right to
vote and should be confident that
their vote is counted fairly so that
their voices can be heard," Margo-
lis wrote in an e-mail. "While the
election board has offered a rem-
edy for the glitch, I remain disap-
pointed that this happened at all."
Multiple phone calls to DAAP
Presidential Candidate Kate
Stenvig went unreturned.
Some student voters also expe-
rienced a second problem when
trying to access the voting web-
site. Benson encouraged students
to vote using the vote.umich.edu
website. Though a second web-
site, mvoteblue.com, was set up
for this election, some students
have reported problems with the
site.
The sites are redirected to the
same URL, Benson explained
- meaning students could
use either address. However,
because some students have
reported problems with mvote-
blue.com, Benson is encouraging
students to use vote.umich.edu
to ensure they are able to access
their ballot.

Democrats face threats
in light of health care bill

Unrest over reform
led to vandalism,
violent messages left
for legislators
Unrest over sweeping federal
health carelegislation has turned to
vandalism and threats, with bricks
hurled through Democrats' win-
dows, a propane line cutatthe home
of a congressman's brother and
menacing phone messages left for
lawmakers who supported the bill.
The FBI is investigating the
instances, which include shat-
tered windows at four Democratic

offices in New York, Arizona and
Kansas. At least 10 members of
Congress have reported some sort
of threat as of yesterday, and no
arrests have been made.
The brick flung through the
window of a county Democratic
Party office in Rochester, N.Y., over
the weekend had a note attached:
"Extremism in defense of liberty
is no vice," roughly quoting 1964
Republican presidential nominee
Barry Goldwater.
A New York congresswoman
whose office window also was
smashed with a brick accused the
Republican leadership of failing to
denounce attacks against lawmak-

ers who supported the legislation.
The vandalism was at Democrat-
ic Rep. Louise Slaughter's district
office in Niagara Falls early Friday,
two days before the House passed
the health care overhaul bill.
"It's more disturbing to me that
Republican leadership has not con-
demned these attacks and instead
appears to be fanning the flames
with coded rhetoric," said Slaugh-
ter, a key supporter of the bill.
House Republican leader John
Boehner of Ohio said in a state-
ment that while many Americans
are angry over the bill's passage,
"violence and threats are unac-
ceptable."

Budgeting success
State legislature shouldn't cut higher ed funding

t seems inevitable - though distasteful - that tuition will
increase again this summer. And one of the budget bills
passed on Tuesday by the Michigan Senate won't ease the
severity of that increase.If it becomes law, the bill would decrease
the funding public universities receive from the state in the next
fiscal year. But higher education can't manage another funding
cut. Before the state House of Representatives votes on the bill, it
must realize that it would damage not only higher education in the
state, but also the state's potential economic recovery. To protect
Michigan, state representatives should vote the bill down.

On Tuesday, the state Senate passed
a bill that would drastically cut funding
for public universities. The bill, which
will now head to the House Appropria-
tions Committee, would reduce state aid
to public universities and colleges by 3.1
percent. The legislation was cited as one of
the many ways state politicians are look-
ing to alleviate the states' approximately
$920 million budget deficit. According to a
Monday report in the Daily, the University
would see a $10.2 million cut in state aid if
the bill is approved by the full legislature.
The bill would also establish a Tuition
Grant Program that intends to help stu-
dents pay for their attendance at private
colleges within the state.
Unavoidably, cuts will have to be made to
balance the state's budget deficit. But more
cuts to higher education are unacceptable.
Public universities' ability to help improve
Michigan's economy is damaged when
funding is cut. Institutions like the Uni-
versity bring the state revenue by drawing
in researchers and producing students in a
variety of fields to diversify Michigan's econ-
omy. The state must allocate more funding to
this economic resource, not cut it.
And slashing funding to public univer-
sities would mean that funding for the
colleges would have to be supplemented
elsewhere, like from student pockets' or

the elimination of programs. Students
can't afford another cut to education fund-
ing. Funding cuts will inevitably lead to
an even steeper tuition hike for University
students than expected. Though the bud-
get passed by the Senate includes a grant
program, it wouldn't compensate all the
students affected by tuition increases - it
only subsidizes tuition for private univer-
sities. The state legislature must consider
these side-effects before it makes more
cuts to education.
The state legislature should look at other
programs that can withstand cuts, like the
state's corrections budget. Currently, over
20 percent of the state's general fund is
put toward correctional facilities - almost
$2 billion to a single department. Correc-
tional facilities could handle a decrease in
funding. But one of the budgets passed on
Tuesday by the Senate actually increased
funding to corrections by $43.7 million,
according to a Tuesday report by The
Detroit News. Instead of increasing fund-
ing to an already bloated system, the state
should dedicate more money to under-
funded institutions of higher education.
The state should be increasing funding to
higher education - not cutting it. The House
should encourage higher education's effect
on the economy and protect Michigan stu-
dents by not passing the education budget.

Dear President Mary Sue Cole-
I can't thank you enough.
Your administra-
tion's proposal to
ban outdoor smok-
ing on all three
University cam-
puses - Ann Arbor,
Dearborn and
Flint - effective
July 2011, is truly
a lifesaver. Your
administration's ALEX
reason, according
to the Smoke-Free BILES
University Initia-
tive website, is that
you are "trying
to help people move toward healthy
behaviors," which will ultimately
benefit everyone.
Your administration has also pub-
licly stated numerous times that the
ban has absolutely nothing to do with
the negative effects associated with
second-hand smoke, but rather to
"promote a culture of health."
You don't know me - or barely any
of the University students, faculty
and staff that choose to smoke and
that this ban would affect - person-
ally. Your administration has refused
to even consider so-called "common-
sense" alternatives to a total ban like
banning smoking in high traffic areas,
the establishmentof "smoking zones"
or allowing the ban to be voted on by
the University community. But all of
your administration's actions seem
perfectly reasonable to me.
I have just a few recommendations
to offer. If you're correct - that is,
if encouraging "healthy behaviors"
such as the cessation of smoking will
result in a benefit to everyone - then
your proposal is far too modest.
Just think about it! Consump-
tion of fast food, lack of exercise and
unprotected sex are also unhealthy
behaviors. What's true for banning
smoking will also hold true for these
acts. If your administration and the
Smoke-Free University Steering

Committee, which is tasked with
implementingthe ban, are really seri-
ous about campus health then we stu-
dents beg you to address these issues
as well.
Like you said, encouraging ahealthy
environment will help us address our
rising health care costs. First of all,
the University should implement a ban
on all fast food restaurants on cam-
pus to be consistent with a "culture of
health." That means no more Wendy's,
Pizza Hut, Panda Express or that evil
Mrs. Fields. And we especially need to
get rid of Taco Bell. We also must lib-
erate ourselves from the soft drinks,
popcorn, hot dogs and other unhealthy
foods that plague Michigan football
games and other sporting events.
Remember, we need to put people
ahead of all those corporate contracts
the University makes so much money
from - no matter what.
Additionally, there should be a limit
on how much students can eat in the
cafeteria. A "no seconds" rule must be
implemented and the University must
cease the production of desserts and
chocolate chip cookies, even if that
means firing the people who make the
desserts in the cafeteria.
Lack of exercise is a major prob-
lem at campuses around the country
as exemplified by the "freshman 55."
If the University wants students to
unite in the name of campus health,
they must mandate that all students,
faculty and staff exercise for at least
two hours and 30 minutes a week at
one of the University's recreational
facilities, as the Centers for Disease
Control recommends. A violation of
this policy should result in a stiff pen-
alty. Such a move would be incredibly
beneficial to the University's welfare
and the true epitome of "moving peo-
ple toward healthy behaviors."
Finally, we must address the hor-
rors of unprotected sex. The spread
of sexually transmitted infections
is a huge threat to our health. Like
any consistent regulatory body, the
administration needs to act in order
to send a resounding message to the

campus community. I pondered a
variety of brilliant methods in which
this could be accomplished, includ-
ing a return to all single-gender
residence halls or chastity belts that
students must wear until graduation,
whereupon they will be removed by
you, President Coleman.
Your campus
smoking ban is
truly a life-saver.
But I came upon an ingenious one.
We can't afford to risk the spread of
STIs. Therefore, all sexual activity i
must be deterred. By requiring that
anti-aphrodisiac chemicals be added
to all beverages in dorm cafeterias,
we can greatly reduce the chance of
students engaging in sexual activ-
ity and consequently spreading STIs.
This policy would promote a "cul-
ture of health" without any negative
effects, just like government mandat-
ed water fluoridation.
For the benefit of all students, fac-
ulty and staff at the University, your
administration must prove its com-
mitment to developing a "culture of
health" by going far and above a mod-
est smoking ban. I don't enjoy seeing
people smoking in the Diag anymore
than I enjoy seeing obese individuals
walking out of the Michigan Union.
It's obvious that competent adults
- many of whom pay to attend this
school - aren't responsible enough to
make their own decisions. Clearly we
need the University to make choices
for us through coercion, even when
they infringe on our individual rights
to engage in a perfectly legal activity.
Yours Truly,
Alex Biles

In remembrance of alum
John Philip Dawson III
TO THE DAILY:
Readers of the Daily know (or should know)
that many former top editors have gone on to
distinguished careers. I write to mark another
such individual, Prof. John Philip Dawson III,
who died on Mar. 21 in New York.
Phil Dawson was the son of a distinguished
University law professor, John P. Dawson, and
his wife, Emma. He graduated from the Uni-
versity of Michigan in 1950. While here, he was
editorial director of the Daily, writing clear
and incisive commentary on the issues of the
day. He obtained his Ph.D. from Harvard in
1961 and taught French history at Stanford and
Brooklyn College. He wrote "Provincial Mag-
istrates and Revolutionary Politics, 1789-1795,"
and more than 40 historical articles and other
works. He taught more than 40 graduate and
undergraduate courses and trained some of
today's leading historians.
He was my predecessor as editorial director
of the Daily and, in fact, it was at his urging that
I decided to join the Daily in 1958. His brother,
Peter Dawson, was associate editorial direc-
tor in my year. Phil always thought the people
attached to the Daily were among the bright-
est and most interesting people on the campus,
which I trust is still the case. Although a mag-
isterial scholar, he was very warm and easy to
approach, with a wonderful sense of humor
always at a boil just below the surface.
Philip H. Power
Regent Emeritus
O'Mahen failed to notice
seven year Iraq war tributes
TO THE DAILY:
I am perplexed by Patrick O'Mahen's state-

ment that "the seven-year anniversary of
the start of the Iraq War passed without
much fanfare" (Keeping the war close to home
03/22/2010). Indeed, if he had checked the
online version of The Michigan Daily, he
would know that students, faculty and com-
munity members gathered on the edge of
campus to mark this anniversary (Peace rally
raises awareness about war in Iraq anniversary,
03/22/10). (Full disclosure: I am one of the
Michigan Peaceworks organizers of the "What
is the Price of War?" demonstration and was
quoted in the article.) At the same time, 10,000
people marched on Washington D.C. and many
smaller events were held in cities and towns
throughout the country. These events, like our
own, received little media attention. That does
not, however, mean they did not take place.
I am equally perplexed as to why the editors
of the Daily found it more important to include
pieces about a Pokemon video game and a Cali-
fornia underwear race in the print edition than
to include the very well-written article about
the protest. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan
have cost nearly a trillion dollars and hun-
dreds of thousands of lives. But neither of these
issues received any coverage in the print edi-
tion of the Daily even though they are of para-
mount importance.
The Daily did include an article about the
passage of 3-percent cuts to higher education
by the Michigan State Senate (State Senate
cmte. passes bill to cut higher educationfunding,
03/22/10). Ironically, this was the very connec-
tion that our rally was trying to make. When
hundreds of billions of dollars are diverted to
war and defense spending, inevitably less funds
will be returned to states for funding domestic
needs, including higher education.

The state of the statement

f I were to mention "the State-
ment," I imagine most of my
friends would think I was refer-
ring to the Daily's
weekly news mag-
azine. But, in fact,
there's a different
statement that
may have more of
an impact on the
lives of students
here in Ann Arbor.
Formally known _
as the Statement
of Student Rights
and Responsibili- GREEN
ties, this document
is the University's
official iteration
of exactly that. The text of the docu-
ment 'is available for anyone to read
on the University's website.
It's odd, then, that many people
don't know about it. Such a signifi-
cant document should be recogniz-
able to all students at the University
- not just those forced to read it after
getting caught drinking Franzia in
Bursley.
But I don't blame students for their
ignorance. Frankly, reading the state-
ment doesn't leave students with a
better understanding of either their
liberties or their duties on campus.
Instead, through overcomplicated and
patronizing language, the document
likely evokes bitter memories of paren-
tal authority as it focuses on deeming
certain behaviors as unacceptable.
Outlining inappropriate conduct
is, of course, necessary. There are
those on campus who probably need
to be reminded in writing that burn-
ing down the Chemistry building is
a bad idea. But the statement should
take a more proactive approach to
addressing students' actions.
In its current form, the docu-
ment supposedly intends to focus
on "rights and responsibilities" but
spends little time discussing either.
of eight rather lengthy sections, only

one comparatively short article is
reserved for enumerating students'
rights. In that section, the statement
basically reiterates select liberties
granted by the United States Bill of
Rights, protects students from dis-
crimination and creates a safeguard
from "capricious decision-making
from the University."
To be sure, all of that's key in such
a document. But instead of merely
reminding students that we have the
right to speak our minds, the state-
ment ought to encourage us to do
so. Rather than simply affirm that
students will be protected from dis-
crimination based on our various
self-definitions, the statement should
challenge us to question labels and
social norms and encourage us to
critically examine ourselves.
And that's where the "responsi-
bilities" part comes into play. That
section happens to be the shortest
of the document's eight, devoting
only two sentences to what the core
of the document ought to entail. It
starts out with an important truth -
that "along with rights come certain
responsibilities." And it concludes,
rather abruptly, by reminding us of
a student's duty "to obey local, state,
and federal laws."
Yet rather than restating the rights
and legal obligations that character-
ize everyday life, the statement needs
to focus on the unique experience
of being a student at the University.
It should reclaim the ideal of the
"Michigan Man" from its current
usage as an athletic catchphrase and
define it as an intellectual and ethical
standard to which all students in Ann
Arbor should be compared. It would
remind us that though our classes
teach us to talk the talk in all kinds
of languages, we also have an impera-
tive to walk the walk as members and
representatives of our community.
As the beneficiaries of a world-class
education, we have a responsibility to
change and repair the world. We have

heard the stories of exceptional Wol-
verines who have come before us -
Raoul Wallenberg, Clarence Darrow
and Arthur Miller amongst so-many
others - and we have an obligation to
raise the bars they've set.
Students have a
responsibility to
change the world.

By simply enumerating all the
things the University doesn't want
students to do, the statement misses
out on an opportunity to stimulate
truly exemplary behavior from the
student body. The current document
implies that the University expects
nothing more from students than to
be law-abiding like all other people.
Instead, it should encourage us to
stand out.
I am reminded of the extraordi-
nary character of this place all the
time. Just recently, the stellar show
of University students at the latest
Winter Olympics brought even more
pride to Ann Arbor. Those Olympians
were keenly aware that wherever a
Michigan student goes, asa represen-
tative of the University, his actions
have a bearing on much more than
just his own reputation.
It's widely known that the Uni-
versity is dedicated to the academic
growth of its students. But scholastic
maturity, while clearly vital, cannot
create an exceptional citizen alone.
Ethical mindfulness and the tenacity
to make positive change are part of
the equation. The University ought to
use the statement to remind students
of that.

doing the legwork to find infor-
mation, I'd still he in prison
today," Provience said in the
release. "They started with one
lead, and they took it from there,
just kept finding more and more
details."
Yesterday's announcement
was the latest in a series of devel-
opments throughout the case.
The prosecution had put stu-
dents from the Innocence Clin-
ic on the witness list for the
retrial, which Innocence Clinic
co-director Bridget McCor-
mack called an "unusual move,"

according to an article published
in The Michigan Daily yesterday.
According to the article,
Moran was in the process of ask-
ing Wayne County Circuit Court
Judge Tim Kenny to remove the
students from the witness list.
In November 2009, Innocence
Clinic officials were able to free
Provience based on the decision
by Larry Wiley - a key witness
in the case - to recant his testi-
mony and police records, accord-
ing to DeGroff.
Wiley originally testified that
he was present at the shooting
and that he saw Provience and his
brother carry out the shooting,
DeGroff said. But Wiley recanted
his testimony, saying that he was

pressured by the police to testify
against Provience.
During a hearing in late Janu-
ary, Kenny ruled that Wiley,
could not testify without incrim-
inating himself.
In December, Innocence Clin-
ic officials obtained a police
report detailing the accounts of
seven different people, which
stated that the perpetrator was
shooting from the beige Buick
Wiley identified in his original
testimony.
Also in December, the Inno-
cence Clinic obtained documents
from the prosecution that include
a list of cars owned by Antrimone
Mosley - a man linked to Hunt-
er's murder. The car described in

the actual testimony by the seven
eyewitnesses was included in
this list of cars.
Innocence Clinic officials have
argued that Mosley, along with
his brothers are responsible for
Hunter's murder. The Mosleys
allegedly believed Hunter stole
their trailer full of marijuana.
In addition, Detroit Police
officer William Ashford told
prosecutors that he believes the
Mosley family is responsible for
Hunter's murder and that he
has linked Hunter's murder to
the murder of Detroit residents
Courtney Irving and Maurice
Sutherland and has linked all
three murders to the Mosley
family.


RESEARCH
From Page 1A
In an interview, Mason said
research has been a large focus
for the three universities, add-
ing that university research has a
large economic and social impact
on the state. The three universities
have had a net economic impact of
$14.5 billion on the state's economy,
according to Mason.
Mason also said researchers at
the three universities have been
essential in exploring the answers
to the state's difficult problems.
"If you look at some of the
research that's going on at these
three institutions, they have
addressed some pretty significant
challenges," he said.
Despite the successes of more
experienced researchers, Mason
said state legislators also need to
hear about the successes of under-

conception of Islam in the news
is not very good, so we are really
hoping to change that."

Week, said the week was intended

graduate students, which is why
yesterday's forum was so impor-
tant.
"I think it's important to high-
light the research activities that
students are involved in to our
legislators and policy leaders in
Lansing and focus on the exciting
things they are doing within our
university system," Mason said.
Several University of Michi-
gan students - affiliated with the
Undergraduate Research Opportu-
nity Program, which pairs under-
graduate students with a faculty
advisor to assist in research - from
all three of the University's cam-
puses presented at the event.
UROP Director Sandra Greger-
man said the students speaking at
the capitol were chosen by faculty
members based on the possible
impact their research could have
on the state's economy and other
issues important to state legisla-
tors.
Yaqub added that the week-
long event was meant to engage
both Muslim and non-Muslim
students on campus.
"We encourage non-Muslims to
come, that's why we put on these
events," he said. "We take on the
most asked about questions, like
headscarves and Jihad."
"I'm not hoping to make these
anti-Muslim people love Islam,
but I want to make them hate it a
little less," Yaqub said.
Abe echoed Yaqub's senti-
ments, saying that she is hurt by
the fact that people have formed
the wrong idea about her reli-
gion.

Among the students presenting
were Public Policy senior Cath-
erine Laurion and Engineering
freshman Andrew Farron. Their
research project - in collaboration
with the Institute for Research on
Labor, Employment, and the Econ-
omy - is focused on a local busi-
ness incubation model.
The project matches up local
entrepreneurs with professional
service providers, like lawyers or
insurance agencies, in order to sup-
port new businesses and ideas in
communities, Laurion said.
Laurion said she believes the
business incubator model will be
an effective way to turn Michigan's
economy around.
"Things like these grassroots
ideas, that is the way to build Mich-
igan up and make it stable," she
said.
Laurion added that she is glad
to have the opportunity to share
the model with state legislators,
"We know it's not about
oppressing women and blowing
up random buildings and killing
people, it's definitely not. It's so
far from that," she said. "Islam is
so beautiful, in my eyes, that to
see people who take it and twist
it and other people who believe
that they are spreading the proper
Islam, it's just horrible."
Amer Ahmed, associate direc-
tor of MESA/Trotter Multi-Cul-
tural Center, said he is hoping
tonight's lecture will draw a large
audience and reinforce some
of what was discussed at other
events throughout the week.
"I'm hoping that people will

so state leaders can start thinking

neurship.
Engineering freshman Sita Syal
was also chosen to present her
research project, which focuses on
ways to use incinerated waste as
construction material.
In an e-mail interview before
the event, Syal said she was "very
excited" to speak at the forum.
"I think my research project has
a lot of potential to impact the state
of Michigan, and I am glad to know
that my voice will be heard," she
wrote.
Syal added that she is grateful
for the opportunities she has had
while participating in UROP.
"I think we are very lucky here
at Michigan that we have such
an easy way to get involved," she
wrote. "Participating in research
has given me a chance to apply
what I am learning to real life

hope they will feel like they got
exposed to something they oth-
erwise would have never gotten

the individuals they'll come
across and the people that they'll

Ahmed said he also believes the
topic of the lecture is especially
relevant in context of the issues
Muslim Americans currently face.
"The role of Islam and Muslims
in America is extremely impor-
tant in the political, social and
cultural climate of the United
States right now," he said.

PETA

awareness about animal rights
and encourage students to take
action by either signing up to be
a part of their efforts or becom-
ing vegan.
The Michigan Animal Rights
Society organized the event,
which has been held at 14 other
colleges this year.
MARS president and LSA
sophomore Joe Varilone said it
is important to hold events like
the exhibition to target college
students, who are more likely to
reconsider their opinions about
animal rights activism than older
audiences.
"College students are really
receptive," Varilone said. "Their
habits are less ingrained in their
minds, and they want to learn
things and become better peo-
ple."
Department of Public Safety
spokeswoman Diane Brown said,
though PETA-sponsored events
have spurred protest in the past,
she has not seen any cause for
concern regarding safety and
security at the University in light
of PETA's campus visit.
"I know PETA has had some
controversy at other places in
the country," she said. "But to my
knowledge, there have been no
problems on the University cam-
pus."
Howard Rush, an associate
professor of laboratory animal
medicine, said PETA's presence
on campus has not gone unno-
ticed.
Though biomedical animal
labs maintain tight security year-
round, Rush said an e-mail was
sent to lab workers to notify them
of the PETA event and encourage
them to make sure all person-
nel would be in their authorized
areas throughout the week.
"That's a standard message

that goes out a couple of times a
year for a variety of reasons," he
said. "There's a national world
week for animals in laboratories
in April, so we send it out then
too."
Burke said the exhibit was met
with tremendous support despite
that PETA has caused some con-
troversy in the past.
"We've had an overwhelm-
ingly positive response here and
other places we've visited," she
said. "Everyone seems to want to
do something to take action."
Burke added that she believes
everyone can agree that animals
are being abused regardless of
their personal opinions about
PETA.
"Whatever stigma there may
be, facts are facts," she said. "I
think everyone can agree that the
fact that 95 percent of cows and
pigs raised for food in this coun-
try are having their ears, teeth,
and tails clipped is really sad."
LSA freshman Jacqui Duarte
said, though she agrees with the
message of the exhibit, she felt
the images were too graphic for
such a public place.
"It's not that I don't agree that
animal torture is bad," she said.
"It's just that I think it's a little
too much, and that maybe they
can get their point across in dif-
ferent ways."
Burke said she recognizes that
the exhibit is somewhat graphic,
but she feels the intensity is nec-
essary.
"The images are hard to look
at, but we need to see these things
to make the best decisions in our
everyday lives," she said.
Varilone echoed Burke's sen-
timents, adding that he didn't
think the images would be too
much for students.
"I don't think this is as in your
face as some of the things that
PETA does," he said. "Students
can walk by and just come over if
they want and take a look."

A Friend Dies. Who Cares?

Toxic drinking is an epidemic on
campuses all across America. .
It means consuming so much alcohol
the drinker passes out. But while "sleeping
it off," the victim may be quietly dying.
When you come right down to it, students
themselves are the best ones to tackle
this problem.So, in growing numbers,
Stony Brook students have joined together
in the Red Watch Band movement.
Working with experts, they fine-tuned a
course in techniques to handle these
alcohol emergencies. Red Watch Band
members can act fast, when every second
counts.They know the quick steps they
can take to rescue a passed-out student
from a drinking death, and can immediately
summon professional help. Everyone
completing the course is given the
distinctive red watch for identification.
Since its inception at Stony Brook
University in March 2009, approximately
40 schools across the country have signed
on to implement this lifesaving program.
To prevent toxic drinking deaths, go to

walk to unceremoniously end the
game with three Michigan players.

Hutchins said of Findlay. "She just

Daily Sports Editor
Three days of practice - just
one in pads - have't made much
of a difference in the quarter-
back battle, but at least Michigan
football coach
Rich Rodriguez NOTEBOOK
has seen a bit
more of early-enrollee Devin
Gardner.
"He's a big, strong guy," Rodri-
guez told the media Tuesday
afternoon. "He's very, very - I've
used this word several times -
conscientious about wanting to
learn and knowing not just how,
but the whys, what you're doing.
And he's a talented guy."
Rodriguez mentioned seeing
Gardner play a few years ago at a
camp, specifically remembering
his thought that Gardner needed
to improve his throwing motion.
"He did a lot of work, and the
(Inkster High School) coach-
ing staff did a great job with
him getting him to improve his
fundamentals and his throw-
ing motion," Rodriguez said. "He
still obviously has to learn all the
offense and the techniques that
we do in our system, but he's got-
ten better in three days."
Rodriguez said that he and
his staff haven't really had an
opportunity to evaluate the three
quarterbacks against one another
because they haven't been in live
scrimmage situations yet.
With the coaches standing
mere feet away from Gardner
and sophomores Tate Forcier and
Denard Robinson, it's difficult to
assess areas like knowledge of the

playbook and decision-making
ability. He said after the team
starts truly scrimmaging (with
the first scrimmage potentially
this Saturday), he will have a bet-
ter idea of the Wolverines' quar-
terback situation.
Still, Rodriguez expects
growth in all three quarterbacks
this spring, and he hopes to have
them in positions where they can
help the team at different points
of games.
"I'll be shocked, if all three of
those (guys), in particular Denard
and Tate, don't get tremendously
better in their fundamentals this
spring," he said.
SPRING "GAME": Due to cur-
rent injuries and rehabilitation
processes, the spring game on
April 17 might look more like last
year's offense vs. defense scrim-
mage than two full teams squar-
ing off at Michigan Stadium, as
Rodriguez would prefer.
"What I would like to do, and
I'm sure the players and fans
would like to do, is have a full two
teams that go after each other and
keep score and all that," Rodri-
guez said. "I don't think we were
going to be able to do that anyway,
simply because of a lack of num-
bers at certain positions.
"I do think we'll be able to do
that in the future. We only have
12 seniors on this year's team, so
we'll have a lot more bodies next
season."
Rodriguez also announced
Tuesday that the football program
would partner with C.S. Mott's
Children's Hospital for a fund-
raiser during the spring game on
April 17.

Admission to the game is free,
but fans will have an opportunity
to donate to the hospital upon
entering the gates of Michigan
Stadium, with a chance to win dif-
ferent prizes.
"It's a win-win situation for us
to have an atmosphere similar to
what we did last year, which was
tremendous, especially for our
young players, and a chance to be
able to help the hospital, which
is very dear to many of us in the
'community," Rodriguez said.
INJURY UPDATES: Rodriguez
said two safeties, Vladimir Emil-
ien and Jared Van Slyke, suffered
knee sprains this past week. He
said neither injury would require
surgery, but Emilien might not
return until the last week of the
spring.
Since safety is a position of con-
cern this spring, Rodriguez was
disappointed that these injuries
would keep the safeties off the
practice field.
Rodriguez added wide receiver
Je'Ron Stokes injured his ankle
and defensive end Anthony LaLo-
ta injured his elbow. Both Stokes
and LaLota could return within a
week.
Rodriguez said that the other
players - center David Molk,
defensive tackle Mike Martin,
wide receiver Junior Hemingway
and running back Vincent Smith
- that are out for the spring
are "on schedule and probably
ahead of schedule as far as their
rehabs."
Molk, who tore his ACL dur-
ing last season, was able to jog
and take snaps during no-contact
drills in practice.

opponents
Kent State and
Toledo by double digits, the Wol-
verines face Northwestern (7-11
Big Ten, 18-14 overall), the only
other Big Ten team remaining in
the Women's National Invitational
Tournament (WNIT), for the right
to advance to the elite eight.
"It's nice to see somebody else
in your schedule rather than your
conference teams because you bat-
tle each other so much," Michigan
coach Kevin Borseth said after a
35-point win over Kent State in the
first round of the WNIT. "It's still
nerve-racking, but it's someone
new so, in some respects, it's fresh."
Never in program history have
the Wolverines faced an opponent
four times in one season. If the
previous three games are any indi-
cation, Thursday's game won't be
easy. Especially with both teams
fighting for their seasons.
When the Wildcats came to Ann
Arbor at the end of December, they
took the lead going into halftime
and held on tight the rest of the

way, beating Michigan by four.
And it was 6-foot-5-inch junior
center Amy Jaeschke who led
Northwestern in points and blocks.
Michigan (8-10, 19-13) didn't
fare much better in Evanston at the
beginning of February. After trail-
ing for most of the second half, the
Wolverines took a one-point lead
with two minutes left. But the lead
quickly vanished, and Michigan
lost by four, again.
"We didn't look even like we play
organized basketball," Borseth said
after the loss. "We really never had
rhythm the entire game. It was the
second game we played them and
never had rhythm. We did shoot 43
percent, but it didn't feel good. Just
didn't feel good."
Jaeschke, again, did plenty of
damage, scoring 15 points.

When the Big Ten Tournament
rolled around, the Wolverines
knew it was crunch time, but so
did Jaeschke. If the team didn't
make it past the first round of the
tournament, there was no guar-
antee they would see postseason
action. But Michigan took an early
lead despite Jaeschke's impres-
sive offensive performance and
five blocks, and the Wolverines
never relinquished it, winning by
13. Five Wolverines scored double
digits to win.
If Michigan can muster a repeat
performance of that March 5 game,
offsetting Jaeschke's impact with
another impressive offensive cam-
paign, it could get even with the
Wildcats en route to a 20-win sea-
son, the first in 10 years for the
Wolverines.

Junior Carl Hagelin, pictured here against Niagara, leads the Wolverines in points, shots and power-play scoring this season as Michigan's best offensive threatB
Firs-round series holds reunion
for Hagelin and Swedishlinemate

By RYAN KARTJE
Daily SportsEditor
For some players, it's hard to
feel at home during the long hock-
ey season. And that's especially
true when your home is over 4,100
miles away.
But that's how junior forward
Carl Hagelin has spent the last
three years at the University of
Michigan. Hagelin's hometown of
Sodertalje, Sweden sits near the
eastern coast of the Scandinavian
Peninsula.
But as the Wolverines take the
ice against Bemidji State on Satur-
day in the first round of the NCAA
Tournament, Hagelin will have a
little slice of home waiting for him
in Fort Wayne.
Emil Billberg, who plays on the
Beavers' fourth line, was Hagelin's
best friend, roommate and line-
mate for three years in Sweden
whenboth were in high school and
juniors. And since leaving Sweden,
the pair hasn't seen each other.
"We're excited to see each

other," Hagelin said. "He hasn't
seen me play in three years, I
haven't seen him play in three
years. It should be fun just to see
him around and hopefully beat
him."
And Hagelin's performance on
the ice, as one of Michigan's mar-
quee offensive threats, will be key
if the Wolverines hope to defeat
Bemidji State and move one step
closer to the Frozen Four.
Billberg hasn't had quite the
success Hagelin has this season,
notching just three points in the
regular season, but Hagelin called
attention to the fact that both were
competitive on the same line when
the played with Sodertalje J20.
His recent impact has not been as
loud as it was when Michigan was
struggling - the junior forward has
been the most consistent Wolverine
on offense this season - but Hage-
lin was still named to the CCHA
All-Tournament team this past
weekend and has tallied at least a
point in 16 of the last 17 games.
"Carl's a big part of this team,

and it'd be tough without him,"
junior Louie Caporusso said. "He
brings the speed, he brings a lot
of elements to this team. And he
shows up every night."
It's Hagelin's consistency that's
made him so valuable and will
prove him to be an asset through-
out the NCAA Tournament.
Hagelin leads the team in points
(47), shots (158) and power-play
scoring (20), and with his speed on
the ice, has developed into Michi-
gan's most dangerous offensive
threat.
Until Caporusso went on an
offensive tear in the season's sec-
ond half, Hagelin also led the team
in goals. And after being criticized
for his inability to light the lamp
last year, the newfound goal-scor-
ing ability was a huge plus for a
team that lost an important offen-
sive contributor in Aaron Palushaj
after last season.
"We all saw that coming," Capo-
russo said. "He has such good
speed, such good hands. We knew
he was going to finally get some

goals and put some points up on
the board, and we won't be sur-
prised when it keeps going."
Against Bemidji State, Hage-
lin's defensive, as well as offensive,
capabilities may be put to the test
unlike they have all season.
The Beavers boast a dominant
first line that's scored more than
50 goals this season, making it one
of the top lines in the country.
"My job is to shut them down
before I use my offense," Hagelin
said. "Defense is the first job ... We
better be extra aware defensively."
And though Billberg and Hage-
lin have exchanged a few words of
Swedish trash talk since finding
out their first round draw, Hagelin
won't let the reunion distract him
from Michigan's goal this week-
end - two wins and a bid to the
Frozen Four.
"At this moment, (the reunion)
doesn't really matter," Hagelin
said. "I'm playing for my team,
he's playing for his team ... The fuel
I have to win right now is enough
even without seeing him."

"You're going have the same thing
that hundreds of thousands of other
people have."
She believes that vintage, however,
is all aboutoriginality.
"That's stunningly amazing to me,
that people will pay good money for
corporate repro for something where
we have the original," Whitt said.
"I've had the buyers of Anthropolo-
gie come into the store and buy things
which, then, they base their items on.
They're basing it off of merchandise
that we have the originals of."
Coombs takes a more organic view
on the specific items in the store.
"I feel like certain pieces belong
with certain people," Whitt said. "I
bought this sweater that I wear pretty
much every day, and I feel like it was
meant for me to have. Everything here
has a soul and a soulmate. I've seen it
happen. Some girl will try on a dress
that a million different girls have
tried, and it will look different on her.
"And she'lljustlove it and beso happy

justsocool."
With an incredibly rich under-
standing of past styles, McLeod would
be the first to admit that she prefers
the aesthetics of bygone eras.
"I'm kind of in this la-la land of
the past," she said. "I don't really pay
too much attention to current trends.
When I check out Vogue from today
I mean, I read Vogues from 1962, I
have this whole collection - you just
see so many influences from the past."
These influences, as McLeod points
out, are key in understanding how
younger generations interpret future
styles, fashions and even lifestyles.
"I think people are striving for
another time," McLeod said. "If you
focus on the past, (on) this country
in the past, you're uplifted. There's
kind of a throwback to even morals
and values of the '40s and '50s where
you hold onto what you have and you
value what you have ... there's this
innocence. I really think this younger
generation is cravingsomethingthat's
been missing for so long."
Even with her love and under-
standing of the golden ages of Ameri-
can style, McLeod is keen to realize
that it might seem like ancient history
to others. Always with an ear to the
ground, she doesn't mind tailoring the
store to her customers' tastes.
"The '70s used to be my cutoff, but
now I sprinkle in the '80s because
there's this demand for it today, it's
fashionable and avant-garde. But I'm
not ready for the '90s for another five
years."

Perhaps unique to Star is how each
of the items in the store is named.

the piece is from and the price; on
the other, a sassy name describing it:
"Melty Cuteness," "I vant this dress,"
"Wow! Superfine."
"It's just something that I started
when I first started the store," Whitt
said. "When I first started tagging
everything, I thought, 'Wow, this
looks like Audrey Hepburn, or this
looks like James Dean or Johnny
Cash.' And then I just started naming
things. And it's been a traditionof ours
for five years."
Coombs says that the customers
tend to flock in, either from far away
or in literal flocks.
"We'll get big groups of sorority
girls that'll just want to try every dress
on, just have fun with it. But a lot of
people from out of town that come to
Ann Arbor and want fun activities to
do also find us here," Coombs said.
In terms of the store's turnover,
clothes come in and out fairly often.
Every week, Whitt brings back gar-
bage bag-sized drops from places
ranging from estate sales to rag hous-
es. .
"The world is a treasure hunt. I
have a house out west in Wyoming, so
I'm always shopping (everywhere),"
Whitt said.
"A big thing with working in a store
like this is that there's so much stuff
that if you don't rotate and change it,

clothing that we feel isn't selling any-
more, we just donate it," she added.
Coombs, who was just promoted to
store manager a few weeks ago, will
soon be learning to price the items.
"Pricing isn't standardized; it's
based on the rarity of each piece and
the quality - those are probably the
two basic criteria," Whitt said. "I
will be spending a lot of time with
(Coombs) just really going over the
fine-tuned detail of 'how to identify
various pieces and relating to their
quality and era and rarity. It's a very
specific educational process."
Although the staff doesn't usually
go with Whitt on her famous "trea-
sure hunts," they actively participate
in designing the store displays and
naming the items.
"It's a wonderful collaboration of
everybody's input, and really always
has been: It's really the very fun,
unique, expressive representation of
the employees," Whitt said.
When clothes are fresh on the floor
and customers haven't had the chance
to see them yet, employees have been
known to indulge in a few pieces for
themselves.
"It's hard to be around the store
every day and not buy something,"
Coombs said. "Especially when I first
started working here, I was like, 'I
want this and this and this.' All my
favorite clothes are from here, defi-
nitely."
Whitt admits that sometimes she
can't help herself.
"It's been known to happen. I think
one of my original fantasies with

having a vintage store was having
this massive store where I could just
change clothes a hundred different
times," she said. "When you end up
dealing with it as a business, most of
the things that I buy end up going into
the store. But there are occasionally
those pieces that never make it down
there."
Whitt is considering making
some of the items in her store avail-
able online. Purely online vintage
stores like ModCloth and Etsy enjoy
great success, taking advantage of
contemporary society's reliance on
technology and interest in obtaining
one-of-a-kind items.
"There's definitely a section in the
back that we are not allowed to touch,"
Coombs said. "(Whitt) has really
amazing, really old stuff back there,
which would do a lot better online
because it's the easiest way to reach
collectors."
Still, Star Vintage will not be leav-
ing its Ann Arbor location in favor of
online sales. Meanwhile, the store's
consensus about large chain stores
like Urban Outfitters is generally not
favorable.
"The prices are not OK with me. I
think it's overpriced and was probably
made in sweatshops. That place has
no soul," Coombs said. "This place -
I feel like it has a history to it. It's all
different and it's unique and you won't
find two of the same thing."
"If you're buying the repro (repro-
duced) stuff knocked off in China,

How looking
backward makes you
fashion forward
By ARIELLLE SPECINER
Daily Arts Writer
In the 1950s, Coco Chanel intro-
duced the revolutionary "Chanel
Suit," which allowed women to
express what many saw as a new-
found social freedom. Then, in the
1960s, the mini-skirt was introduced,
paving the way for the ultra mini-skirt
we see today. In the following decade,
wide-legged disco pants were all the
rage for boogieing to "Saturday Night
Fever." The '80s transformed the way
we wear spandex, and the 1990s took
us down a looser path by introducing
the world to the grunge era (thanks
for that, 1991... I guess?).
What do the 2000s bring us? Well,
it's difficult to categorize the 2000s
into one trend. The 2Ks have shown
us a conglomerate of all five decades of
fashion, and even includes some ear-
lier ones. And we call it: vintage.
Vintage style is made up of pre-
viously worn apparel from bygone
decades (or even just years). These
pieces from the past only grow bet-
ter with age. An older designer dud
(say, a vintage Valentino gown from
the 1960s, for example) can be worth
double, even triple the amount of a
new garment of the same type.
But what propels this seemingly
paradoxical movement? Designers are
looking backward in order to move
forward, and new customers are quite
literally buying into it. So, to ask it
bluntly, what is it about vintage cloth-
ing that allows these fashion "innova-
tors" to get away with recycling of this
kind?
Uniqueness, rarity, the sense of
owning something that, most likely,
not too many people possess anymore.
It's possible that this appeal alone is
enough to push a new fashion fad for-
ward. After all, fashion is about defin-
ing yourself as a unique individual. So
despite the fact that the vintage trend
barelyincorporates newlooks intothe
fashion world, it might be credible to
call it a "new" fashion advancement.
And present designers seem to agree.
In the Fall 2010 Louis Vuitton col-
lection (which debuted during Paris
Fashion Week), LV's creative direc-
tor, Marc Jacobs, brought audiences
back to a time when voluminous,
high-wasted, knee-length skirts were
donned with feminine blouses, remi-
niscent of the '50s sock-hop days. Also
duringthat Fashion Week, designer
Miuccia Prada for M iM hincorpo-
rated a '60s theme into her designs,

presenting short go-go mini-dresses
that looked as if Twiggy would have
been destined to wear them.
However, the question is whether
the vintage fad shows a lack of cre-
ativity and originality in the designers
and the consumers. Have the sarto-
rial minds of the once innovative and
visionary fashion houses led us astray
with just remnants of the past to dwell
on? The answer is really a matter of
opinion: Some may see the vintage
trend as a waste of time, while others
see it as a creative way of moving for-
ward. But even those in the anti-vin-
tage camp should admit that vintage is
anything but lazy.
Pulling together the perfect pieces
from the fashion pinnacles of former
decades is not an easy task. In fact, it
can be even more difficult than tradi-
tional innovation. Vintage-influenced
designers must foresee tomorrow's
fashions and do extensive research on
past trends, then find an impeccable
balance between the two. Erring even
the slightest bit too much toward past
or future could result in the complete
failure of a look. A dowdy pair of wide-
legged jeans from the '70s can seem
quite obsolete if paired with another
piece of'70s flair. But if one decides to
balance it with a tight-fitting tank top
tucked in to the denim, a great look
can be created.
This new generation of old looks on
the runway converts to not only a shift
back in time for retail establishments,
but also a boost in sales for many sec-
ondhand stores, which has far-reach-
ing benefits. Buying clothing from
thrift stores is now considered "cool"
because thrift stores are among the
only places to buy authentic vintage
garb. And even though many shoppers
may not have this in mind, buyingsec-
ondhand has a real, positive environ-
mental impact.
Buying used means less demand
for fabrics and other materials whose
gathering or production have a nega-
tive ecological effect. Also, as fewer
new garments are being produced to
meet the smaller demand, less dyeing
is performed. (The dyeing of clothes
has among the greatest pollutant
effects of any aspect of the fashion
industry)
Some might protest the recycling of
old looks, saying there's nothing cool
about living in the past. But, like it or
not, the vintage craze is here to stay,
and there's more skill involved in it
than one may expect. Successful fash-
ion is always reincarnated in some
form - it's just more blatant now than
it has been before.
Fashion is always reinventing itself,
and this trend is no different. St's just
that this time around, fashion has cho-
sen to reinvent itself with, well, itself.

know it's there," Coombs said.

Costume Jewelry: a timeless obsession
by: LeahBurgin, Daily Fine Arts Editor

Americana finds its
revival surrounded by
vinyl and kitsch
By MIKE KUNTZ
Daily Music Editor
Kelly McLeod is always on the
lookout.
Dressed like June Carter dropped
into a John Hughes movie, she eyes
a small, silver owl necklace adorning
the Espresso Royale cashier handing
her a latte. McLeod's curiosity and
enthusiasm are obvious. Compliment-
ing the barista on her find, she invites
her back to her store, The Getup,
where, she assures, more vintage
necklaces like that one can be found.
The owl is barely visible, but McLeod
picks it out like a long-lost friend in a

crowded room. To call her an expert
would be an understatement.
It's this genuine love for pursuing
and preserving the past that makes
McLeod the ideal vintage clothing
store owner. Her store, The Getup,
located just north of Liberty on State
Street in Ann Arbor, is home to con-
stantly revolving racks of lost and
found clothing from as far back as
the Great Depression. In its mere six
years of existence, the store has quick-
ly become a hotspot for students and
locals alike, attracting a followingthat
rivals that of stores five times its age.
"We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for
the same SO people I see every day,"
McLeod said. "It's like a Cinderella
story, you gotta like it and it's gotta
fit ... there are so many individuals in
Ann Arbor, and bringing them some-
thing that's really gonna turn them on
is a lot of fun."

Since its start in February 2004, in
the cramped attic above its current
location, The Getup has evolved into a
bustlingstorefront packed to the walls
with Dust Bowl-era prom dresses,
rock tees from the '70s (Styx, Jeffer-
son Starship and Peter Frampton tour
shirts line the rafters), a kitschy Elvis
painting and shelves (and shelves) of
old cowboy boots. It's like walking
into a time machine that got trapped
somewhere between a Norman Rock-
well painting and a Hunter S. Thomp-
son peyote daydream. Looking around
is like a history lesson, and it's hypno-
tizing.
"There really is this moment,
this energy in the clothes," she said.
"Everything in here has to have per-
sonality, beauty or a story."
With a quick glance around the
store it's hard to disagree. Between
the racks of old Western shirts, leath-
er Members Only jackets and Golden
Era Hollywood dresses, it's tough to
imagine McLeod's collection hav-
ing anything boring to say. But with
such storied clothing, she contends,
comes a certain sense of obligation.
"When somebody prior to me
owning (their clothing) has cared
for it for more than fifty years, I feel
there's this responsibility," she said.

EVERY FRIDAY.

First came the trays. I remember coming home from
school and finding more and more antique serving plat-
ters littered throughout the house. Some were hung on
walls, some decoratively displayed on shelves and a rare
few were actually used as they were intended. No corner
was without a tray. Everywhere the brightly colored tin
demons glared and clinked at me. It was a nightmare.
After our house was stuffed with more trays than
anyone could possibly use in a lifetime, my mother (the
tray-aholic) turned her mania down a different avenue
- antique clothing. Now all the closets were stuffed past
capacity with coats, dresses, belts, shoes and God knows
what else. But it didn't stop. From clothing my mom
turned to purses (oy) and from purses, she turned to hats
(oy vey). We were starting to get worried. Her fanaticism
was terrifying.
But we didn't even know what was tocome. There was
no way to predict the all-out, full-throttle, complete and
utter obsession that my mother was to develop next: cos-
tume jewelry.
My mother became possessed. She would go "junking,"
traveling to estate sales, antique stores or thrift shops like
her life depended on it. Soon, the amount of costume jew-
elry in the house eclipsed the combined number of trays
and articles of antique clothing. Jewelry took over our
lives. And since my mother lived and breathed it, the rest
of the family did too.
But now, a few years later, the crazy has finally calmed
down. My mother still collects costume jewelry, but not
with the same fanaticism. After the initial shock of the
whirlwind of brooches, earrings, bracelets and necklaces
that stormed into my life, I've now come to appreciate -
but not understand - my mother's obsession.
Costume jewelry is beautiful. Though the pieces were
created as cheap substitutes during the first phase of
mass-produced jewelry, the craftsmanship is superb.
Beginning in the 1930s, there was a whole world of jewel-
ry designers and each had their distinct style. There was
no way you could mistake a Miriam Haskell for a Crown
Trifari, and costume jewelry collectors know this - they
look for "signed" pieces, or ones with the designer's mark
on their backs.
There is an art to collecting costume jewelry. Some
vintage designs were reproduced much later by frauds
and paraded as genuine pieces. It takes a trained eye

(with the aid of a jeweler's loupe - which my mother car-
ries with her at all times) to distinguish the frauds from
the real deal.
But there's more than that. As with every collection,
it takes intuition to know which types of pieces should
be collected. Should one try to stick to a particular era
or a particular designer, or try to collect a sample from
every era and all designers? The eventual destination of
the collection is also a concern. Will the collection be sold
to another collector, donated to the Providence Jewelry
Museum, worn for fun or ultimately re-enter the cycle in
the collector's estate sale?
For my mother (and most other collectors) the answer
is "all of the above." My mother wears her jewelry almost
every day, has sold some pieces and has given some as
gifts to her loving daughters and family members. And
her collection mirrors its use. My mother has a little bit of
everything: some rare pieces to treasure and possibly sell,
some fun pieces for novelty and a whole bunch of "nor-
mal" pieces for everyday wear.
Having a vintage jewelry store in my house has been
helpful on many occasions, providing my sister and me
with beautiful, unique pieces to wear for Halloween,
school dances and other fancy events. It's also fun to
just look and admire - some of the pieces are hilarious
(a huge, plastic, googly-eyed dog brooch comes to mind)
and some are exquisite, like the set of Italian mosaic ear-
rings and necklace that my mother gave me last year for
my birthday.
But most important, having almost a century's worth
of costume jewelry at my fingertips has changed my out-
look on what, exactly, is "vintage." People tend to lump
the century's distinct styles and schools of art - art deco,
retro, etc. - with antique jewelry from the 19th century
into the all-encompassing term "vintage."
Now, I'm no expert on style movements of the 20th cen-
tury (or costume jewelry for that matter), but I do think
it's important to know what you're wearing. It's fine to
mix together different eras, just don't do so in ignorance.
Don't just pin a brooch to your cardigan because it's "vin-
tage." Don a pair of screw backs or clip-ons because you
have an appreciation for their historical aesthetic. You
don't have to be as crazy as my mother, but at leastbe cog-
nizant of what jewelry you feel communicates your per-
sonality. Knowledge is fashionable.
