ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

LSA freshman Noah Wolfson 
hadn’t heard of the University of 
Michigan’s annual fall EarthFest 
event, 
so 
he 
was 
pleasantly 
surprised when he saw, dotted 
across the Diag, stands offering 
sustainability information, donuts, 
apples and more.
“To be honest, I actually didn’t 
know this was happening until I 
walked onto the Diag,” Wolfson 
said. “But after walking past, 
I thought I’d take a nice stroll 
around. I think they’re really 
promoting sustainable energy in a 
really positive manner.”

The 
Office 
of 
Campus 
Sustainability, otherwise known 
as Planet Blue, hosted the 23rd 
EarthFest Thursday, a celebration 
aiming to engage and educate 
students on how to become involved 
in environmental sustainability.
Dozens of student, community 
and 
University 
organizations 
participated this year, including 
Habitat for Humanity, the Program 
in 
the 
Environment 
and 
the 
Campus Farm. To draw in students 
like 
Wolfson, 
booths 
offered 
items including succulents, a hot 
commodity according to EarthFest 
coordinator Ashlee Rothfuss.
“The 
(Matthaei) 
Botanical 
Gardens always comes and does 
a succulent giveaway that the 

Nurses and allies of their fight 
for a new contract, including 
higher wages and increased staff-
to-patient ratios, heavily populated 
the meeting, both inside and 

outside the golf course. University 
of 
Michigan 
Professional 
Nurse 
Council 
organized 
the 
demonstration 
and 
included 
several nurses speaking publicly 
during the meeting.
The UMPNC voted Monday 
to authorize a three-day strike 
amid protracted labor bargaining 

disagreements with the University. 
UMPNC 
members 
previously 
filed 
unfair 
labor 
practice 
chargesagainst the University for 
failing to bargain in good faith, 
making shift changes without 
notification and taking action 
against free speech.
Mary Beth Carlson was the first 

nurse to speak at the meeting, and 
lauded the proposed labor changes 
and the UMPNC’s bargaining. She 
directly addressed the Regents at 
the end of her speech.
“I 
am

The University of Michigan 
Board of Regents announced 
a 
3.5 
percent 
increase 
in 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel’s 
annual 
salary 
as part of the president’s 
yearly 
evaluation. 
This 
is 
the 
president’s 
fourth 
pay 
raise, and brings his pay from 
$820,000 to over $850,000.
The Regents are also set to 
renew Schlissel’s contract for 

another five years, as he enters 
the fifth year of his current 
contract, though the measure 
was not voted on Tuesday. His 
starting salary upon hiring in 
2014 was $750,000.
The 
last 
four 
years 
of 
Schlissel’s term have been 

marked by campus unrest on 
issues of racial disparities, 
sexual 
misconduct 
and 
political 
turmoil 
following 
the 2016 presidential election. 
On the administrative side, 

Five 
out 
of 
10 
public 
comment speakers focused on 
the University falling short in 
their efforts to combat climate 

change. Students and faculty 
emphasized 
environmental 
issues as ones that should 
be top priority, specifically 
carbon 
neutrality 
— 
the 
common environmental goal of 
a net zero carbon footprint.
LSA sophomore Catherine 

Garton 
and 
LSA 
senior 
Julian Hansen, two of the 
students present, co-founded 
the University of Michigan 
Climate Action Movement, an 
organization 
that 
promotes 
climate 
change 
awareness 
and has a goal of 100 percent 

carbon neutrality. Garton said 
current 
University 
efforts 
need to go further to act as an 
environmentally-conscious 
example 
among 
academic 
institutions.

At the University of Michigan 
Board of Regents meeting on 
Thursday, University president 
Mark Schlissel presented new 
initiatives to combat sexual 

misconduct on campus. The 
programs include mandatory 
sexual misconduct training for 
all faculty and staff and a new 
website with information on 
reporting sexual misconduct 
and educational resources.
The 
initiatives 
were 
the 

result of the Working Group 
on Faculty and Staff Sexual 
Misconduct investigations into 
current 
University 
policies 
on 
misconduct. 
The 
group 
published their findings online 
today; suggestions include the 
website, increased education 

and wording changes to show 
a more formal commitment to 
combating sexual misconduct 
on campus.
The 
committee 
was 
co-chaired by Laurita Thomas, 

The board passed a motion 
to replace and demolish the 
Central Campus Recreation 
Building, 
originally 
built 
as a collection of buildings 
between 1956 and 1978.
The budget for the project 
is $150 million and would 
encompass 
a 
space 
that 
is 
200,000 
square 
feet. 
The funds will come from 

investment proceeds, 
gifts and the Student 
Life 
Student 
Fee 
for 
Facility Renewal. However, 
Regent 
Andrea 
Fischer 
Newman (R) clarified the 
fee wouldn’t increase for 
students.
LSA and Business senior 
Jazz 
Teste 
spoke 
during 
public comment in support 
of replacing the CCRB. She 
emphasized the importance 
of recreational facilities on 
campus for mental health and 
productivity.

Amid 
a 
cultural 
controversy 
regarding 
free speech and the role 
of the press in criticizing 
the 
government, 
about 
30 
students 
and

a panel hosted by the 
University

Law 
School 
Thursday 
afternoon commemorating 
Constitution 
Day 
and 
discussing the role of free 
speech in U.S. history. 
Law professor Leonard 
Niehoff hosted the panel 

and opened the discussion, 
emphasizing 
the 

importance of dialogue that 
outlines 
the 
distinction 
between 
protected 
free 
speech 
and 
sedition 
— 
conduct or speech designed 
to incite rebellion against 
the government.
“We 
find 
ourselves 
living during a time when 
the question is whether 
the 
criticism 
of 
the 
government by the press 
has become repressive or 
unfair,” Niehoff said.

however, the Regents continue 
to 
shower 
Schlissel 
with 
glowing performance reviews. 
“Our conclusion, President 
Schlissel 
is 
knocking 
the 
ball out of the park,” Regent 
Chair Andrew Richner, R, 
said. “From the outside, I 
don’t think we appreciate just 
how demanding and complex 
the job of the University of 
Michigan president is. I know 
this president spends 24/7 on 
his responsibilities.”
“I 
have 
the 
most 
challenging, but the best job 
in all of higher education,” 
Schlissel said. 

Schlissel’s salary outstrips 
the average public university 
executive’s pay of $521,000, 
according to 2016 data from 
the 
Chronicle 
of 
Higher 
Education. His pay raises do 
track with rising executive 
compensation 
around 
the 
country, which increased by 
about 5 percent overall last 
year. 
University alum McKenna 
Kozeny criticized the pay 
raise as a poor use of funds in 
light of the growing student 
debt. 
“The Go Blue Guarantee 
is a great start, but higher 
education is still extremely 
unaffordable 
for 
so 
many 
people,” Kozeny wrote in an 
email interview.

Kozeny 
also 
criticized 
Schlissel 
being 
provided 
housing 
on 
campus 
while 
students have to pay high 
rents 
to 
live 
off-campus. 
According to U.S. Census data, 
the median rent in Ann Arbor 
has increased by 14 percent 
from 2010 to 2015. The current 
median rent is approximately 
$1,075 per month.

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
There is an institutional bias that’s built into 
corrections. Even though it’s called corrections, there is a 
bias to keep you illterate, to keep you at a remedial level. 
And it takes a village to get former inmates back into 
society,”

Paralegal Edward Sanders on his time in prison and efforts to boost litearcy of re-entering citizens on the outside. 

Every Friday, one Daily news staffer will give a behind the scenes 
look at one of this week’s stories. This week, LSA sophomore Riley 
Langefeld covered the city’s crackdown on Bird scooters.

“It was a bit frustrating to write because it was difficult to reach a lot 
of the city officials in time, especially because we were writing it the 
day it became news but it was definitely an interesting topic and it 
was interesting to see how the city officials react to this crisis that 
has arisen in the last few weeks and how they’ve interacted with Bird 
officials. It’s kind of tested a lot of the city’s ability to quickly respond 
to changes in the environment that especially involve college students 
as a lot of the use of the Birds has been by University students. It’s 
been interesting to learn about that and see how it’s been developing 
over the past few weeks and how it will be in the future.”

Riley Langefeld: “Bird faces extinction as City seizes dozens of 
scooters”

Schlissel said the University 
community has a stake in 

fighting 
sexual 
misconduct 
and encourage those who have 
experienced 
misconduct 
to 
report incidents.
Previously, staff and faculty 
had the option of participating 
in 
already 
existing 
sexual 
misconduct training. After the 
group’s recommendations, all 
training will be mandatory for 

all staff and faculty. University 
Provost Martin Philbert said 
education on how to recognize 
and prevent sexual misconduct 
is a good first step for improving 
campus culture and reducing 
misconduct cases.
“The University’s mission of 
education, research and service 
requires that every member 
of 
our 
community 
feels 
welcomed, valued and able 
to work free from the threat 
of 
sexual 
misconduct,” 
Philbert 
said. 
“Sexual 
misconduct is a very serious 
matter, something that we 
seek to prevent and that we 
are committed to addressing 
immediately and effectively 
should it occur. Our work 
to prevent and address such 
misconduct 
begins 
with 
education.”
This 
announcement 
comes 
two 
weeks 
after 
the release of Office for 
Institutional Equity’s yearly 
Sexual Misconduct Report 
which reported an increase 
in 
sexual 
misconduct 
reports but a decrease in 
investigations launched by 
the University compared to 
previous data. According to 
the publication, reports went 
up from 218 to 277 while 
investigations went down 
from 28 the previous year to 
20.
Previously, the University 
appeared 12 times in a 
crowdsourced 
spreadsheet 

documenting 
sexual 
harassment and assault cases 
involving 
staff 
and 
faculty 
members. 
The 
anonymous 
sources cited instances such 
as 
unwelcome 
advances, 
comments and sexual assault 
cases at the University, some 
dating back to the 80s.

students 
absolutely 
love,” 
Rothfuss said. “I cannot tell 
you how many emails I got 
asking if they were going to 
be there.”
This was Rothfuss’s first 
year organizing the event. 
She said many organizations 
returned 
to 
participate, 
such as Leslie’s Science and 
Nature Center, which gives 
animal demonstrations, and 
MDining, 
which 
teaches 
students how they can cook 
healthy food. The goal of 
EarthFest, 
Rothfuss 
said, 
is 
to 
educate 
students, 
especially on the University’s 
sustainability goals.
“It’s really just to educate 
the 
students 
on 
campus, 
and to help them find out 
how they can get involved 
in sustainability and what 
sustainable 
groups 
are 
available 
in 
their 
area,” 
Rothfuss 
said. 
“And 
it’s 
really to support the six 
sustainability 
goals 
that 
U-M has. It’s just this giant 
come-together 
of 
people 

distributing information so 
the students know what’s 
going on.”
One of the booths involved 
was the University’s Waste 
Reduction 
and 
Recycling 
Program. Program Manager 
Tracy Artley said she’d been 
coming 
to 
EarthFest 
for 
15 years and admired how 
popular it’s become in that 
time.
“It’s grown a lot since the 
earlier days of the fest, where 
it was literally just a couple 
of booths and a band,” Artley 
said. “Now it’s so much more. 
So many more groups at the 
University and outside the 
University are participating 
now, which I think really 
increases our impact with 
the students because when 
it’s bigger, more people come, 
and more people hear your 
message.”
For the Waste Reduction 
Program, Artley said, the 
message is to decrease waste 
products 
and 
make 
sure 
recyclable and compostable 
items go to the right place. 
She also encouraged students 
living off campus to reach 
out via their website if they 

have questions about waste 
reduction.
“Our 
mission 
is 
to 
encourage 
the 
University 
of Michigan community to 
reduce waste by reducing 
the amount of items that are 
consumed, and then anything 
that is generated that needs 
to be disposed of, going to 
the proper location, whether 
that’s composting, recycling, 
or alternative,” Artley said.
All of the stands, Rothfuss 
emphasized, are primarily 
for the students.
“We really do it for the 
students,” 
Rothfuss 
said. 
“That’s what it’s all about, is 
to just inform and educate 
them on ways that they can 
be more sustainable and what 
their school and what their 
environment is doing to be 
more sustainable as a whole.”
When 
asked 
what 
his 
takeaway 
ideas 
from 
EarthFest 
were, 
Wolfson 
highlighted the importance 
of taking care of the Ann 
Arbor community.
“Ann Arbor’s our home 
too,” Wolfson said. “We have 
to make sure we keep it clean 
and keep it safe.”

the 
people,” 
highlighting 
the importance of the First 
Amendment 
in 
allowing 
the 
people 
to 
hold 
the 
government accountable.
Panelist Ashley Messenger, 
the in-house counsel for NPR 
specializing in issues that 
affect news gathering and 
dissemination, said the U.S. 
Constitution revolves around 
the involvement of everyday 
citizens.
“There really is no such 
thing 
as 
government,” 
Messenger 
said. 
“If 
you 
actually 
read 
it 
(the 
Constitution) it says it does 
not establish the government, 
it does not establish authority, 
it establishes a process. The 
way we interpret the First 
Amendment actually means 
all of us in the process, not 
just those in government. 
You 
actually 
need 
the 
participation of others to lead 
this country properly.”
Former 
U-M 
professor 
Vincent 
Blasi, 
currently 
a 
professor 
at 
Columbia 
Law 
School, 
explained 
the 
distinction 
between 
protected 
speech 
and 
sedition has been frequently 
disputed 
throughout 
U.S. 
history.

“Truth was no defense 
(against 
allegations 
of 
libel 
or 
sedition),” 
Blasi 
said. 
“If 
anything, 
it 
undercut 
the 
government 
even 
more. 
Falsity 
was 
applied to conjecture and 
characterization.”
Blasi explained free speech 
was not always protected, 
and laws like the Espionage 
Act of 1917 sent citizens to jail 
for speaking out in criticism 
of the government.
“We take it for granted 
now that we can say what 
we want even if it gives the 
government a bad reputation, 
but it wasn’t then,” Blasi said.
Niehoff 
explained 
potential issues with speech 
and even the Constitution 
that 
the 
government 
continues to encounter today.
“We have this model and 
yet it is sort of fraught with 
problems,” Niehoff said.
Blasi 
and 
Messenger 
agreed the Constitution is 
something that is constantly 
evolving in government.
“The Constitution itself is 
an experiment,” Blasi said. 
“We’ll see how long it works.”
As 
students 
expressed 
uncertainty 
regarding 
whether 
free 
speech, 
particularly that of the press, 
will continue to be protected, 
Messenger said from her 
experience at NPR she does 

not feel the press’s voice will 
be silenced.
“Media law is actually a 
really well-established law,” 
Messenger said, “It’s not new 
for the government to feel 
threatened by the press. Does 
the law tend to be on our 
side? Yes. Because the First 
Amendment is not partisan. 
It does not discriminate. 
It would be an incredibly 
uninformed and shortsighted 
move to go after the media.”
The panel was open to 
the public and the audience 
featured several of Niehoff’s 
law students, as well as local 
Ann Arbor citizens.
Law School student Scott 
Haeck said the panel was a 
valuable experience.
“I have a personal interest 
in the civil rights law and in 
this day and age, government 
criticism 
in 
particular,” 
Haeck 
said. 
“Besides, 
when else do we get to rub 
shoulders with such highly 
respected people? I thought 
some 
interesting 
points 
were raised and it was a 
valuable experience to have 
these valuable philosophical 
discussions raised in a setting 
where we are not trying to 
get to a particular point.”

“The University is trying, but 
it is not trying hard enough,” 
Garton said. “I feel that we have 
fallen behind in this regard. 
Climate change is the biggest 
problem facing my generation.”
Hansen 
added 
sustainable 
policy and culture on campus is 
crucial, and the entire University 
community including students, 
staff, faculty, alumni and Ann 
Arbor residents play a role in it.
“We were brought together 
to reposition the University of 
Michigan as leaders and best 
in the fight for a clean energy 
future,” 
Hansen 
said. 
“The 
leaders of the University of 
Michigan need to step up.”
Supporting the students were 
Prof. Doug Kelbaugh, former 
dean 
of 
Taubman 
College 
of 
Architecture 
and 
Urban 
Planning, 
and 
Prof. 
Joseph 
Trumpey, 
director 
of 
the 
Sustainable Living Experience. 
Kelbaugh said the University 
should think long-term when 
considering how best to reduce 
their carbon footprint.
“If you don’t act now, who is?” 
Kelbaugh said.
Trumpey 
emphasized 
the 
University is at the bottom of 

the Big Ten. He also reiterated 
carbon 
neutrality 
as 
an 
important focus not only to keep 

up with other universities but 
also for the community.
“I have 25 terrific students 
in 
the 
Sustainable 
Living 
Experience, 
but 
they 
simply 
can’t change the student culture 
on campus,” Trumpey said. “We 

need everyone on board … We 
must create and live a new truth 
together.”
Bernstein 
addressed 
the 
concerns brought up by the 
students and faculty.
“I’d 
like 
to 
add 
to 
the 
examination of our goals, how 
they relate to other universities 
and perhaps an exploration of far 
more aggressive and ambitious 
goals in this arena,” Bernstein 
said. “I urge the University to 
make this a priority moving 
forward.”
The 
board 
also 
expressed 
interest 
in 
listening 
to 
a 
presentation 
from 
the 
U-M 
Climate 
Action 
Movement 
regarding ideas and areas for 
improvement moving forward.
Currently, 
the 
University’s 
largest 
sustainable 
initiative 
is Planet Blue, which has goals 
of 
reducing 
greenhouse 
gas 
emissions, waste sent to landfills 
and 
increase 
locally-sourced 
U-M food.

day,” Carlson said. “I need you 
to live up to your responsibility 
to solve this problem so I can 
do my job.”
Following Carlson, Michigan 
Medicine nurse Tracie Lentz 
spoke about her experience 
being diagnosed with a blood 
cancer last year and urged 
action from the board. Lentz 
also 
criticized 
University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel’s 
previous comments in support 
of free speech protections, 
noting nurses were not allowed 
to wear buttons and shirts 
in support of their union — a 
major complaint in the lawsuit 
filed against the University last 
week.
Nurse 
Lynn 
Sharrock 
has 
been 
working 
at 
the 
University for more than four 
decades and participated in 
the demonstration. She was 
among the nurses asked to stop 
wearing pro-union clothing 
at work. Sharrock recounted 
details of the difficult working 
conditions she faced when she 
started and said that it is still 
necessary for the nurses to 
fight for better treatment.
“When I first started here, 
we didn’t have a union,” 
Sharrock said. “I made $11 
an hour. And sometimes if 
somebody didn’t show up for 
work, I would just have to stay 
and stay. If I was at home — this 
is before answering machines 
— if my phone rang and I 
answered it, they said you had 

to come in, I had to come in or 
else I could be losing my job.”
The nurses were joined 
by members of the UMPNC 
leadership. Donna Carnahan, 
vice chair of the UMPNC, was 
present at the demonstration 
and expressed her hope that the 
board would respond promptly 
to 
the 
nurses’ 
demands. 
Carnahan 
expressed 
her 
frustration with the situation, 
noting that she has been part of 
the contract negotiations since 
they started in January and 
that the UMPNC has gained 
little.
“Today we’re here to get the 
regents’ help,” Carnahan said. 
“Our contract is based with the 
regents, and things have shut 
down at the table, and it’s now 
time to get the regents involved 
in trying to get a contract for 
the hospital. We don’t want to 
do any of this. We don’t want 
to do this work stoppage if 
we don’t have to. We would 
like to continue to take care 
of our patients. But we need 
to stand up and have ratios in 
the contract for safe patient 
staffing … We can’t get this 
done without them because 
nobody is listening.”
Regent 
Mark 
Bernstein 
(D), responding to the nurses 
speaking at the meeting, said 
he was “saddened to hear” 
the 
relationship 
between 
University 
nurses 
and 
the 
board has “frayed” and urged 
a collaborative future effort 
from 
all 
parties. 
Several 
other regents agreed with his 
sentiments.
Nurse 
Rebecca 
Bertha 

also spoke at the meeting 
and voiced concerns shared 
by many nurses about anti-
union sentiment in the nursing 
leadership. Bertha specifically 
cited 
an 
interview 
with 
Chief Nurse Executive Ann 
Scanlon McGinity, a member 
of the Michigan Medicine 
executive 
leadership, 
from 
2015 in which she expressed 
strong anti-union views and 
an unwillingness to work with 
union leaders.
“The change in nursing 
leadership since (former Chief 
Nurse 
Executive 
Margaret 
Calarco) 
left 
has 
really 
hurt the climate of mutual 
respect between nurses and 
management,” Bertha said.
Michigan 
Medicine 

denounced the strike in an 
email statement, saying they 
provided 
competitive 
and 
reasonable offers to the nurses, 
which 
were 
subsequently 
rejected. 
According 
to 
Michigan 
Medicine 
spokeswoman Mary Masson, 
the organization offered the 
nurses raises of at least 3 
percent. Masson also said the 
nurse-to-patient ratio is in the 
top 2 percent in the nation.
“We are disappointed that 
our 
UMPNC 
nurses 
have 
voted to approve a strike,” 
the 
statement 
reads. 
“We 
have been bargaining in good 
faith since January and have 
offered a competitive package. 
… We remain ready to continue 
bargaining with the UMPNC 
and are eager to resolve the 
contract negotiations.”

EARTHFEST

University 
of 
Michigan 
professor John Cheney-Lippold 
made waves on campus this 
week from rescinding his offer to 
write a letter of recommendation 
for LSA junior Abigail Ingber 
after realizing she requested the 
letter to apply to a study abroad 
program in Israel. The email 
exchange between the professor 
and 
Ingber 
was 
posted 
to 
Facebook in a screenshot Sunday 
by Club Z, an organization that 
works to empower and network 
Jewish 
students 
who 
are 
committed to Zionism.
Throughout the week, the 
letter has continued to garner 
positive and negative attention 
from the campus community.
According 
to 
the 
Detroit 
Free 
Press, 
Cheney-Lippold 
has received death threats for 
his email to Ingber. But some 
campus organizations, such as 
Students Allied for Freedom and 
Equality, a Palestinian solidarity 
organization at the University, 
have come out in support of the 
American 
Culture 
professor. 
SAFE released a statement on 
Facebook 
Tuesday 
evening 
stating the organization stands 
in solidarity with the students 
and staff members boycotting 
Israeli universities.
Cheney-Lippold has received 
criticism and claims of anti-
Semitism from students and 
community members regarding 
his 
decision 
to 
revoke 
his 
recommendation letter.
SAFE’s 
statement 
begins 
by presenting examples of the 
human 
rights 
violations 
on 
Palestinian land, writing “there 
is no question of the violence and 
inequity perpetuated by settler-
colonial Israeli apartheid.”
“We 
support 
and 
affirm 
Professor 
John 
Cheney-
Lippold’s right to boycott Israel,” 
SAFE statement reads. “His 
actions are the same demanded 
by Palestinian civil society, and 
serve to recognize and resist 
forces committing human rights 
violations. To punish Professor 
Cheney-Lippold for his actions 
would curtail his own academic 
agency.” 
SAFE also points out how 
quickly the University responded 
to this incident. SAFE claims 
students have been placed on a 
political blacklist for speaking 

against human rights violations 
in Palestine, and the University 
has never released a statement 
on that issue. 
“There has been no University 
statement on the matter,” the 
statement reads. “This blacklist 
is just one of several tangible 
barriers for students that will 
prevent them from engaging in 
not just study abroad programs, 
but academic programs, jobs, 
and admittance into Palestine/
Israel.”
The University’s chapter of 
College Republicans, on the 

other hand, released a statement 
Monday evening calling the 
incident “deeply disturbing” and 
condemning 
Cheney-Lippold’s 
decision not to write the letter. 
The statement was written by 
Chapter President Dylan Berger.
 “Since the 2016 Presidential 
Election, those at the highest 
levels of this University have 
worked 
tirelessly 
to 
silence 
student who dare to think 
independently,” Berger wrote. 
“As 
President 
of 
College 
Republicans at University of 
Michigan, it is my responsibility 
to 
advocate 
for 
students 
like Abigail who have been 
discriminated against in large 
part due to President Schlissel’s 
remarks. If President Schlissel 
is 
serious 
about 
restoring 
intellectual diversity on campus, 
he will terminate professor John 
Cheney-Lippold 
and 
retract 
his remarks that ostracized a 
significant portion of the student 
body of the of the university that 
he claims to lead.”
University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel did speak about the 
letter at Thursday’s meeting 

of the Board of Regents. He 
restated 
sentiments 
from 
a 
Monday press release from the 
University’s Office of Public 
Affairs, which affirmed the 
University’s strong opposition to 
a boycott of Israeli universities. 
Schlissel did not say anything 
about the employment status of 
Cheney-Lippold.
 “The academic aspirations 
of our students — and their 
academic 
freedom 
— 
are 
fundamental to the University 
of Michigan and our teaching 
and 
research 
missions,” 
Schlissel said. “We are a large 
and diverse public university, 
and the individual opinions of 
our community range widely 
on many issues. But personal 
views and politics should never 
interfere with our support of 
students. It is counter to our 
support of students.”
Schlissel went on to say the 
University will continue to look 
into the issue.
“It is counter to our values and 
expectations as an institution,” 
he said. “The regents, executive 
officers and I have been deeply 
engaged in this matter. We will 
be 
taking 
appropriate 
steps 
to address this issue and the 
broader questions it has raised.”
 University Regent Denise 
Ilitch (D) echoed Schlissel’s 
statement 
at 
the 
meeting, 
recalling 
the 
University’s 
mission to its students.
 “At the University of Michigan 
the best interest of our students 
is paramount,” she said. “This 
type of profoundly exclusionary 
contact 
by 
a 
University 
of 
Michigan 
professor 
(goes) 
completely against our mission. 
Let’s call this what it really is — 
anti-Semitic.”
Others took issue with Ilitch’s 
description of the event as anti-
Semitic. University alum Yonah 
Lieberman wrote on Twitter 
that attaching that label to the 
event blew it out of proportion.
“This is outrageous conflation 
of being antisemitic and anti-
Israel,” 
Lieberman 
tweeted. 
“When Nazis are marching in 
the streets and Trump is in the 
White House, it is way, way too 
dangerous to conflate the two.”
Lieberman is a founder of 
IfNotNow, a Jewish organization 
that calls on American Jews to 
abolish the Israeli occupation of 
Palestine.
Ingber was unable to comment 
to The Daily earlier this week 
due to waiting on proceedings 
with the University.

“The academic 
aspirations of 
our students 
- and their 
academic 
freedom - are 
fundamental to 
the University of 
Michigan.”


O

ftentimes 
when 
Americans think about 
a 
person 
exemplifying 
patriotism, 
they 
conjure images of a 
courageous 
soldier 
defending 
American 
values and protecting 
her country against 
enemies, foreign and 
domestic. If you take 
that same framework 
of 
someone 
acting 
with 
courage 
even 
when 
at 
direct 
personal cost, it is 
evident that Christine Blasey Ford, 
a professor at Palo Alto University, 
demonstrates this courage and 
determination.
In July, Ford sent a letter to U.S. 
Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., who 
later passed it on to Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein, D-Calif., who sits on the 
Senate Judiciary Committee. In the 
letter, Ford describes being sexually 
assaulted by current Supreme 
Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh 
and his friend, Mark Judge. The 
assault included the two men 
shoving her into a bedroom, playing 
loud music with the intent to drown 
out her cries for help, repeatedly 
and violently groping her and 
drunkenly attempting to remove 
her clothing. Though the initial 
letter was anonymous, she has since 
allowed The Washington Post to 
publish her name in coordination 
with her allegations.
Since her story has become 
public, Ford has faced atrocious 
personal attacks and questions 
about the veracity of her claims, 
including an assertion by The Wall 
Street Journal that she might be 
misremembering 
the 
incident 
because she had discussed it in 
marriage counseling with her 
husband dating back to 2012. 
Many conservative politicians and 
pundits, including Fox News host 
Tucker Carlson, have asserted that 
she has come forward solely for 
political reasons and cited abortion 
as top among them. And on Friday, 
Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, the 
chairman of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee, released a letter of 
support for Brett Kavanaugh signed 
by 65 women who, according to 
Kavanaugh, knew him in high 
school (it is important to note that 

he attended an all-boys school). If 
Kavanaugh’s first line of defense 
is citing a group of women he did 
not assault to prove that 
he could not possibly 
have assaulted another 
woman, 
then 
surely 
his qualifications as a 
lawyer and a nominee 
to serve on the Supreme 
Court should be called 
into 
question. 
Either 
way, this letter was 
released with the cruel 
intent 
to 
undermine 
her allegations against 
Kavanaugh by painting him as the 
nice guy incapable of what Dr. Ford 
claims.

Despite these malicious attacks, 
Ford has offered to testify before the 
Senate Judiciary Committee, which 
is currently scheduled for Monday, 
Sept. 24. With the re-opening 
of the Senate hearings based on 
sexual 
misconduct 
allegations, 
Kavanaugh’s 
Supreme 
Court 
nomination has become parallel 
in mind to the hearings for Justice 
Clarence Thomas’s confirmation.
In the early 1990s, Clarence 
Thomas was nominated by then-
President George H.W. Bush for 
the Supreme Court of the United 
States. When the Senate Judiciary 
Committee 
hearings 
ended, 
Thomas’s nomination looked to be 
in a fine position for confirmation. 
However, 
an 
FBI 
interview 
leaked that contained allegations 
claiming Thomas had repeatedly 
sexually harassed Anita Hill, a 
lawyer who had worked with 
him. After the leak, the hearings 
were reopened and Hill was 
subjected to extraordinarily sexist 
questioning, including “Are you a 
scorned woman?” asked by then-

Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala. She 
endured vicious personal attacks by 
both the committee and the media, 
often shaded by misogyny and 
racism. Others threatened Hill’s 
life, attempted to get her fired and 
discredited her work as a lawyer.
The virulent treatment of Anita 
Hill by the all-male Senate Judiciary 
Committee, the media and a large 
part of the American people is 
enough evidence to explain why 
Ford might forgo making public 
something 
that 
is 
extremely 
personal, and that occurred over 
three decades ago. And for many 
survivors of sexual harassment, 
assault 
or 
rape, 
the 
cultural 
shame and deep trauma they have 
endured can silence them for years, 
decades or even lifetimes. Even 
after Ford’s name became public 
and she demonstrated evidence of 
the assault, many downplayed or 
repudiated the allegations against 
Kavanaugh outright.
When Kavanaugh was officially 
nominated to serve on the Supreme 
Court of the United States by 
President Donald Trump, Ford 
chose to defend her country from 
generations of extremely radical 
judicial decisions by a man she knew 
to have heinously committed sexual 
assault. She chose to speak out in 
the same world that destroyed Hill 
in the 1990s when she too stood up 
against her harasser, a world that 
also went on to confirm Thomas to 
the highest court of the land. Ford 
spoke up in a world where that same 
man, Thomas, continues to sit on 
the Supreme Court, despite clear 
evidence of wrongdoing.
Ford knows she lives in a 
country that would rather excuse 
the disgusting and violent behavior 
of powerful men by sweeping it 
under the rug or discouraging 
reporters 
from 
investigating 
credible allegations than deliver 
justice to their victim(s). She knows 
exactly what is at stake and did 
not silently sit back, even at great 
personal risk. Instead, she stood 
up and told the story of her sexual 
assault in hopes of stopping the 
destructive path of yet another 
powerful man. And for this, Ford is 
a true American patriot.

Chasing mistakes
“S

tories live where things 
go wrong.”
I still remember 
writing this down in the Notes 
app on my phone, a 
hopeful mantra for and 
from myself, on the day 
I graduated from high 
school. I was in the car 
with my parents on the 
way home from dinner 
when 
my 
dad 
was 
prompted to retell one of 
his famous stories, which 
I had been hearing since 
I was a toddler, about 
him and his idiot college 
friends.
Let me be clear, my father is not 
an idiot, and neither are his friends. 
But when they were 20, they were 
prone to significant lapses in 
common sense, and when they get 
together now, they still revert back 
to that sophomoric state, losing 
several hundred collective IQ points 
along the way. Their shenanigans as 
young men are like folk tales in my 
family, and they seemed to promise 
that similar antics, adventures and 
flat-out blunders (made hilarious by 
hindsight) would fill my young adult 
years.
I was on the verge of leaving for 
a summer of travel and my freshman 
year of college not long after, so my 
parents were frequently prompted 
to break into reminiscence of 
their own time at school and as 
young adults, providing insights 
and advice along the way. I don’t 
remember which story my dad told 
that night in the car. Maybe it was 
about the time they scaled a wall 
to sneak into a castle in Salzburg, 
Austria, a “Mission Impossible” feat 
embarked upon simply to avoid the 
$6 cost of the ticket. Or it could have 
been the one about hiking down the 
Grand Canyon for spring break, in a 
surprise snowstorm, and realizing 
they all forgot to bring water (no 
worries, though, they each had a 
snake bite kit and a bottle of Wild 
Turkey). There was also the time 
they rented a houseboat on Lake 
Mead for the weekend, flew the Jolly 
Roger pirate flag and proceeded to 
pelt an unamused Coast Guard boat 
with water balloons from a giant 

slingshot.
Needless to say, my dad has a 
lot of stories. They generally involve 
poor judgment, alcohol and a series 
of 
miscalculations. 
Yet he survived and 
has been telling the 
tales for almost 40 
years. 
They 
still 
make 
him 
laugh 
every time.
I have never been 
one to make mistakes 
if I can help it. What 
does 
that 
even 
mean? I love order 
and 
preparation, 
completing 
assignments at least 24 hours 
early and making no undue noise 
in public spaces. In middle school 
and high school, I quickly earned 
the reputation of the “mom friend,” 
hanging around with a group of 
guys who, like my dad, scaled new 
heights of lovable stupidity. I made 
sure they didn’t get themselves 
killed doing things no common-
sense person should have to be told 
not to do (there is no situation in 
which you need to duct tape kitchen 
knives to your hands, and yet …).
In the car that night of 
graduation, I started thinking about 
my aversion to stupidity. Since I 
was little, I’ve always been praised 
for being responsible and mature. I 
got good grades in school and could 
carry on coherent conversations 
with my friends’ parents. I was the 
one left in charge when the adult 
left the room. I started to wonder if 
that was always such a good thing. 
Was I too controlling? Would I miss 
out on years worth of adventures 
because I was too caught up in 
potential 
consequences? 
Could 
I be missing out on something 
disastrous enough to still make me 
laugh 40 years from now?
I mentioned this to my dad, and 
he just sort of sighed. “Yeah,” he 
said, “You need to learn to be stupid 
sometimes.”
So, I wrote down the line 
that began this column as a little 
reminder to myself, that stories so 
often are grown in the places where 
things are calamitous or out of 
control, or not particularly smart. I 

set off on my summer of travel and 
hoped that I could heed my own 
advice and learn to chase idiocy.
Anyone that knows me knows 
I failed to do so. I am equally as 
organized and controlling as I was 
the day I graduated high school. But 
as I sat down to write this column, 
I started compiling in my head a 
list of my stories, the ones I tell so 
often that I begin to laugh on the 
front side of the punchline. There’s 
the time I skipped school for senior 
skip day with two friends, but was 
so stressed about missing classes 
that I was miserable and later wrote 
apology emails to all my teachers. Or 
when I went on a first date and the 
guy admitted to having imagined 
a whole future together after our 
hour-long chat (it was the first time 
we had ever met). Or the one when 
my friends and I were delayed five 
hours on a standing-room-only 
train from Edinburgh to Northern 
England, 
and 
everyone 
began 
looting shortbread and Cadbury 
chocolates from the snack cart. We 
spent all day standing between cars 
by the bathroom, laughing, joking 
and gorging on stolen snacks. It is 
one of my favorite memories from 
the trip.
None of my favorite stories were 
born solely from me letting my hair 
down and suppressing forethought. 
Stories so often live where plans 
are lacking, but luckily for people 
like me, you can’t plan life. You can, 
however, choose how you react to 
its randomness. As seriously as I 
may take myself in my day-to-day 
life, I have never been afraid to look 
back and laugh. You can choose 
to see something as a calamitous 
embarrassment or inconvenience, 
or 
it 
can 
be 
embroidered, 
embellished and refurbished to 
make your kids laugh 30 years from 
now, as long as you’re willing to be 
laughing at yourself too. There’s no 
need to chase mistakes when they 
will come rushing at you anyway, 
so you may as well be ready with a 
game, a group of friends and a bottle 
of Wild Turkey close at hand.

The patriotism of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford

Crossing the line

DAVID HAYSE | COLUMN

I

n a recent history course of 
mine, my professor told the 
class that, when reading 
any historian’s work, 
their narrative says 
just as much about the 
time they were living 
in as the period they 
were writing about. 
For example, Roman 
historian Livy, who 
lived from 59 B.C. 
to 17 A.D. and wrote 
about the centuries 
before, had certain 
biases that mutated 
his transcription of past events. 
Livy even says himself that 
he writes with the specific 
purpose of teaching certain 
moral lessons.
This pattern of transcribing 
and relaying “facts” in order 
to fit an agenda is not one that 
ended with Roman historians, 
but like much else, has been 
passed on to contemporary 
times. This is common among 
today’s historians, but more 
prevalent among journalists.
Journalists 
and 
news 
anchors 
are 
extraordinarily 
important people in today’s 
society. 
News 
anchors 
Bill 
O’Reilly, Sean Hannity, Rachel 
Maddow 
and 
others 
are 
household names across the 
country, even for people who 
aren’t that attentive to the news. 
Have you ever stopped to think, 
“Who are these people? Are 
they trustworthy journalists 
or are they biased performers 
looking to gain viewers?” 
News anchors are part of 
the medium through which we 
get most of our information 
on the world, and their shows 
are 
growing 
more 
popular. 
Newspapers 
are 
losing 
readership 
while 
evening 
primetime 
shows 
are 
how 
57 percent of Americans get 
their news. Can we trust the 
front men and women of these 
programs and their staffs to 
credibly choose which stories 
are reported on, and how they 
are reported?
Let’s 
start 
with 
Sean 
Hannity of Fox News. Hannity 
has his own primetime show 
on Fox News in which he 
disseminates 
information 
that is purported to be fact. 
Recently, Sean Hannity lent his 
radio show to two of Donald 
Trump’s attorneys. He didn’t 
have them on as guests to 
answer tough questions about 
the 
potential 
investigations 
the president faces. He gave 
them his show. Rudy Giuliani 
and Jay Sekulow were allowed 
free reign over the program 
for three hours to spread their 
views unchecked and even take 
calls from listeners. This is an 
egregious dereliction of duty 
by a news anchor, to give away 
his show knowingly to allow 
a biased pair of partisans his 
national platform.
Trump’s 
now-former 
lawyer Michael Cohen also has 
proven issues with Hannity’s 
credibility 
and 
ability 
to 
be 
objective. 
Hannity 
was 
also a client of Cohen’s. This 
information was not brought 

forward 
willingly, 
but 
was 
“wrung 
from 
Mr 
Cohen’s 
lawyers by the judge’s order.” 
If Hannity wanted 
to be an impartial 
journalist and show 
a 
commitment 
to 
objective truth, then 
he would have come 
forward with this 
information, instead 
of downplaying its 
significance 
after 
it was revealed in a 
courtroom.
Hannity is not 
the only newsman, conservative 
or 
liberal, 
to 
have 
shown 
bias in both his personal and 
professional life. For example, 
Al Sharpton, whose past is 
strewn with connections to 
the Democratic Party and with 
personal 
controversies, 
has 
a 6:00 p.m. show on MSNBC 
called 
“PoliticsNation.” 
He 
also has a radio show called 
“Keepin’ It Real” and uses it 
along with his position with 
MSNBC to spread his ideology. 
Sharpton has worked in politics 
for decades and has had his 
fair share of controversies. 
The 
Tawana 
Brawley 
case, 
perhaps better known to our 
parents, is a stain on Sharpton’s 
reputation. A grand jury found 

that Brawley had lied and 
made false accusations of rape 
against 
several 
white 
men, 
including two police officers, 
but only after Sharpton had 
made slanderous remarks about 
both the police officers and 
the district attorney. These 
remarks resulted in Sharpton 
being found guilty and fined, 
and, according to some, sparked 
riots. In this case, Sharpton was 
made to put his money where 
his mouth was because he 
jumped on a situation to incite 
anger and gain publicity. He 
attempted to run for office on 
several occasions, but lost in the 
Democratic primary for mayor 
of New York, senator from New 
York and president of the United 
States. These issues, while not 
the only in Sharpton’s past, are 
clear markers of Sharpton’s 
ties to a political party in one 
case, and in the other, reckless 
behavior and slander.
Political bias in the media is 
not limited to Sean Hannity and 
Al Sharpton. Plenty of others 

across 
all 
networks 
spread 
their bias daily with the stories 
they choose to report and how 
they report them, with the 
guests they invite to the show, 
how they treat them and even 
seemingly simple choices such 
as the language they choose. 
Word choice might not seem 
important, and it is not always 
intentional, but it affects the 
tone of the speaker and reflects 
biases.
The point of this article is 
not to make you stop watching or 
reading news, but rather to ask 
that you do a little research into 
those you’ve trusted to research 
and report on the world for you. 
Whether it is Chris Cuomo, the 
host of CNN’s “Cuomo Prime 
Time,” 
whose 
brother 
and 
father are staunch Democratic 
politicians from New York, or 
Laura Ingraham, host of “The 
Ingraham Angle” on Fox News, 
who worked as a speechwriter 
for former President Ronald 
Reagan’s 
administration. 
Ingraham, who has made her 
political stances very clear, was 
encouraged 
by 
Republicans 
to run for Tim Kaine’s Senate 
seat in Virginia, and, most 
concerningly, endorsed Donald 
Trump 
at 
the 
Republican 
National Convention in 2016. I 
don’t mean to say that endorsing 
Donald Trump is an issue in of 
itself, but she set a dangerous 
precedent. “It was the first 
time in modern U.S. political 
history that a prominent media 
figure endorsed a nominee at 
his convention,” according to 
Newsweek writer Bill Powell.
“Congress shall make no law 
respecting an establishment of 
religion, or prohibiting the free 
exercise thereof; or abridging 
the freedom of speech, or of the 
press; or the right of the people 
peaceably to assemble, and to 
petition the government for a 
redress of grievances.”

The First Amendment and 
its supposed guarantee of a free 
and independent press have 
almost become irrelevant with 
the advent of more politicized 
news. The political ties between 
the news media and both the 
Democratic 
and 
Republican 
parties have made them neither 
free or independent. They have 
devolved 
into 
propagandists 
of 
two 
power-seeking 
organizations. This does not 
mean that you can’t watch the 
news or that you can’t trust 
anything you see. It does mean 
however that there is an implicit 
or explicit bias in everything 
you see, and in order to see the 
full picture of any issue, this 
must be recognized. Jack W. 
Germond, a political reporter 
for nearly 50 years, wrote in 
his book “Fat Man in a Middle 
Seat: Forty Years of Covering 
Politics”: 
“The 
rules 
were 
clear then. If you once crossed 
the line from journalism into 
partisan politics, you could not 
return. They were them and we 
were us.”

ANSWER TO PREVIOUS PUZZLE:

Release Date: Friday, September 21, 2018

Summers at my house are 

soundtracked by the oldies. It’s 
something that I credit most of my 
random music history knowledge 
to, just my family sitting with each 
other around the pool, talking about 
songwriters from the ’60s and ’70s, 
listening to soul and rock and, of 
course, The Beatles. There is a shirt 
my dad occasionally wears to these 
parties, partly as a joke and partly 
for its shock factor. He bought it as 
a gag, I imagine at an airport, or in 
Venice, CA., where jokey t-shirts 
hang from store vendors like 
bananas off a tree. Sometimes, my 
stepmom will steal it from him and 
parade through the house in her 
pajamas, but its slogan isn’t serious 
to them. I always question the 
words, and they laugh and throw 
their heads back, saying, “It doesn’t 
really matter, does it? It was all their 
faults.” On the front, in big white 
letters, the t-shirt says one thing: I 
blame Yoko.

Of course, this is in reference to 

the constant cultural assumption 
that Yoko Ono broke up The Beatles, 
a prevailing theory among both 
self-proclaimed scholars and casual 
fans alike. In reality, the reasoning 
behind their infamous dissolution 
is a little more complicated than 
the work of one relationship, 
a combination of the time and 
personal differences between those 
famous Liverpoolian men. Who 
knows, in addition to these things, 
I’m sure Ono and John Lennon’s 
torrid love affair and his subsequent 
obsession with their art and music 
together probably had something 
to do with it. The Beatles’ breakup 

is, ultimately, a mystery, and the 
obvious 
consequence 
of 
what 

happens when a war, fame, money 
and drugs coincide in one place. 
But the question remains — why 
do we still blame Yoko? Why has 
our culture become so attached to 
scapegoating the women in famous 
men’s lives for anything they do?

In reality, Yoko Ono was an artist 

in her own right, and according to 
her, she did not even know of John 
or The Beatles when they originally 
met: In fact, he was a fan of hers, a 
patron of her art long before their 
romantic relationship began. By 
Lennon and Ono’s meeting in 1966, 
she had been a leading member 
of the Fluxus art movement and 
published an experimental book 
titled “Grapefruit.” She was her 
own person, not just an extension 
of a very famous man. Even if you 
set aside the invasive effects of 
racism in Ono’s case, fans were and 
have always been confused about 
why such a legendary band only 
lasted for a very short time. But the 
thing that has lasted, and will likely 
continue to be a cultural touchstone 
for years to come, is the blame 
which floats around Yoko Ono’s 
name. She is not the only famous 
woman who has been portrayed in 
the media this way, and has become 
a reference point for something 
people call the “Yoko Effect” — a 
phenomenon that influences us 
today more than we may even 
notice.

Earlier this month, in the wake of 

rapper Mac Miller’s sudden death, 
Twitter and other social media 
platforms erupted into outrage. 
Most of this was undeservingly 
pointed directly towards Ariana 
Grande, Miller’s girlfriend of two 
years until earlier this year. In this 

case, the “Yoko Effect” is still very 
much alive, a continuing blame 
game which pins the confusing 
and sometimes tragic choices 
of famous men on their female 
partners. It is still happening in 
every conversation we have about 
The Beatles, about Courtney Love, 
about Ariana Grande and everyone 
in between. With every affair, every 
salacious rumor on Twitter or Page 
Six that places the responsibility 
of toxic relationship on a woman’s 
shoulders, we are still blaming 
Yoko. When I read Rolling Stone 
writer Brittany Spanos’s article 
a week ago on this very topic, all 
I could think about was my dad’s 
shirt. Here, in 2018, a time full of 
feminist movements and supposed 
social enlightenment, our culture 
is still fixed on this dangerous 
pattern of blame and assumption 
that absolves problematic men of 
culpability and bestows it on their 
girlfriends and wives. I have caught 
myself thinking in these ways 
many times — the “Yoko Effect” is 
a product of our society’s fixation 
on accountability — where many 
people and influences are in play, it 
is hard to find a character to blame, 
and in most cases, it doesn’t exist. 
But there are ways to subvert this 
phenomenon, and it is our job as 
consumers of the media to break 
the cycle. Do it in small ways, 
like changing the conversation 
when it turns to conspiracy, 
understanding the realities of fame 
and its influence on choice, and how 
society’s misogynistic tunnel vision 
can often look for evil in a woman’s 
shadows. Beyond all of this, maybe 
take off the shirt. It could be a joke, 
but there is a real person in all of 
these cases, and she deserves to 
speak for herself.

Why do we blame Yoko?

Lawrence rides the wave 
of their own versatility

Just as hip hop’s infamous 

boy band seem to multiply on 
stage — feeding off each other’s 
performances 
and 
coalescing 

into a hive of energy that seems 
to either contain 1 or 20 people 
— Lawrence seemed to grow 
stronger the more they played 
through their set at the Blind Pig 
last Mon. night.

Coming from New York City, 

the eight-member band was 
originally formed by siblings 
Clyde and Gracie Lawrence. 
Pulling from a wild mix of 
influences, 
Lawrence 
weaves 

together brass instrumentals, 

tight keyboard-driven rhythms 
and upbeat melodies to create a 
spontaneous fusion of musical 
genres; Aretha Franklin soul 
shakes hands with Carly Rae 
Jepsen pop, and the resulting 
agreement 
that 
Lawrence 

manages to broker is nothing 
short of magical.

All eight band members are 

longtime childhood and college 
friends, 
and 
this 
closeness 

allows them to showcase their 
almost uncategorizable sound in 
the best way possible. Standing 
side by side, the audience could 
see the synergy between the 
members, passing smiles and 
refrains from one person to the 
next like the handwritten notes 
you would send your best friends 

in middle school geometry. The 
music simply flowed. And even 
though the small stage allowed 
little 
extravagant 
movement, 

the dynamic quality of the music 
itself turned the entirety of the 
Blind Pig into a retro dance floor.

The 
jazz 
undertones 
and 

lounge-pop 
bursts 
of 
“The 

Heartburn Song” started off 
the show with layered vocals 
and guitar chords that crooned, 
transforming the worn interior 
of the stage into an underground 
speakeasy: plush velvet booths 
and gilded chandeliers with 
tear-shaped crystals. It’s an 
aesthetic — a vibe, one could 
say — that continued throughout 
their performance. As Lawrence

The Books that Built Us: 
‘The Crying of Lot 49’

I don’t remember reading “The 

Crying of Lot 49” for the first 
time, let alone how it came into my 
life. Those details are eclipsed by 
what I do recall — the process of 
coping with its bewildering form, 
shut in my mint green bedroom at 
1:00 a.m., poring over Wikipedia 
pages on Thomas Pynchon and 
postmodernism. I was about 16, 
and offended by the bizarre little 
book’s refusal to have a plot, to 
develop characters, to … conclude. 
“Why go through the effort of 
writing something that seems to 
mean nothing?” I asked myself. 
“What the fuck?”

“The Crying of Lot 49” is 

composed almost exclusively of 
satirical jabs, distracting details 
and fruitless conversations. It 
chronicles the anti-Odyssey of 
Oedipa Maas as she happens to 
unearth a peculiar network of 
coincidences connected by “a 
symbol she’d never seen before, 
a loop, triangle and trapezoid,” 
meant to represent a muted post 
horn. 
The 
rudimentary 
post 

horn is the sole illustration in the 
slim volume and evolves from a 
point of intrigue to a trigger of 
sorts as Oedipa begins to see it 
everywhere. The physical motif 
is graffitied by polyamorists on a 
bathroom stall, scrawled amid the 
notes of a disillusioned techie and 
embossed on the pin of a member 
of the Inamorati Anonymous 
committed to assisting those who 
have fallen in love (“the worst 
addiction of all”). Oedipa reads 
into the symbols, convinced “she 
will create constellations” out of 
the chaos, but instead finds herself 
“an alien, unfurrowed, assumed 
full circle into some paranoia,” 
struggling to determine whether 
she’s actually stumbled upon a 
massive conspiracy or is simply 
going mad. It ends abruptly, right 
when you think you’ll get some sort 
of answer.

Like Oedipa Maas and her post 

horns, I found myself desperate 
to wring the ridiculousness of 
“Lot 49” into some constellation 
that made sense to me — one that 
looked like clarity, coherence and 
resolution. It was an exercise in 
pure futility, but one that exposed 
a set of rigid expectations for the 
novel I had no idea I was harboring. 
As I slowly came to terms with 
the fact that “Lot 49” isn’t 

conventionally “meaningful,” I felt 
as if I were becoming unstuck, in a 
completely Kurt Vonnegut way. I 
realized I was clinging to structure, 
got embarrassed and loosened my 
grip. The relief was near erotic.

Flash forward two-ish years and 

I’m walking to Name Brand Tattoo 
one Sept. afternoon after Bio 173, or 
some other class I took freshman 
year that has zero relevance in 
what I think I’m doing now. I’m 
half a country away from home, I 
have no friends and I’m trying not 
to be scared as hell. So I’m getting 
a tattoo. When one of the three 
Nicks there asks what I want, I 
open “The Crying of Lot 49” to the 
symbol that haunts Oedipa Maas 
halfway across Cali., and a little 
more than halfway out of (or into?) 
her mind. I get the post horn inked 
in an impulsive, grasping attempt 
to immortalize that little bit of 
un-stuckness I felt in accepting 
“Lot 49,” so subsumed in the angst 
of my moment that I’m oblivious to 
the fact that I’m literally branding 
myself 
with 
a 
quintessential 

emblem of Postmodern Shit.

It was as if I had accidentally 

joined a cult. Since The Tattoo, I’ve 
been approached here and there by 
randos in public who recognize the 
symbol and wish to share a word, 
to rave over Oedipa Maas and the 
Tristero, to recommend a sweet 
new read. If you ink it, they will 
come. One of my professors noticed, 
told me I had a “dope tattoo”— my 
ego orgasmed. Friends who weren’t 
familiar with the novel were 
intrigued by my devotion and read 
it. Some became converts. I visited 
one of them this past summer and 
noticed he had drawn the post 
horn on his wall in Sharpie. When 
I pointed it out, I felt a new sort 
of intimacy establish between us. 
This book gives believers a simple 
way to find each other, and we’re 
here to spread the paranoid love. 
The “Lot 49” subculture, once you 
start to recognize it, is impressively 
prevalent. 
Radiohead 
and 
Yo 

La Tengo have both referenced 
elements of “Lot 49” in their work, 
an insider signal to listeners who 
know it. Oedipa Maas’s signature 
appears in “The Simpsons,” and the 
Google Smartphone App for the 
Treefort Music Fest once featured 
the post horn on its icon. It’s under 
my skin, on a wall in Berkeley 
and scribbled in a bathroom stall 
at SMTD. The magnitude of our 
devotion nearly brings me to tears. 
The realization that I’ve found 
belonging in a ridiculous literary 

subculture does bring me tears.

All these tears have made me 

ironically reluctant to return to 
the text. What if I don’t like it? 
What if it’s actually the squirmy 
sort of Postmodern Shit … and I 
still have this tattoo? I gave it a 
couple years, marinated in the cult, 
continued drawing post horns in 
my notebooks and evangelizing 
nonreaders. In the past year, 
though, 
I’ve 
noticed 
waning 

familiarity with the names and 
references that typically arise in 
“Lot 49” discussions. It was time. 
I tracked down my copy of the 
sacred text (thanks, Dayton) and 
was pleasantly surprised to find 
myself frolicking in the prose. 
There was so much I had missed 
the first time around — the smart 
satire, the raunchy references 
— the book that was once so 
inaccessible had become brilliantly 
hilarious. “Lot 49” round two was 
like reconnecting with a friend, 
and discovering even more virtue 
in them. Encounters like that make 
the relationship so much stronger.

The most impressive discovery 

from my literary homecoming, 
however, is the subtly powerful 
examination of binary thinking 
Pynchon manages to work beneath 
all the absurdity. In the agita of 
her self-doubt, Oedipa is described 
as “walking among matrices of a 
great digital computer, the zeroes 
and ones twinned above, hanging 
like balanced mobiles, right and 
left, ahead, thick, maybe endless.” 
The dark omnipresence of “this 
or that,” the dread of being stuck 
between, indefinitely, with no word 
exactly appropriate for the self in 
the moment. Damn. It is paranoia.

But there’s something to be 

said for how the structureless 
paranoia of “The Crying of Lot 
49” pushes you into a disposition 
that can relieve some of the 
weight of those thick ones and 
zeroes. Once unstuck from my 
rigid expectations, I found myself 
able to notice and appreciate the 
novel’s ridiculousness. Once I made 
peace with the fact that there’s no 
constellation to be drawn, I entered 
an incredible literary community. 
“The Crying of Lot 49,” it seems, is 
an exercise in detaching from the 
anxiety of that tension between 
one and zero. What results is the 
hysterical grace it takes to exist in 
bewildering absurdity — absurdity 
not unlike that of television 
personality presidents and Bird 
scooters.

“Probably Up,” among others 
— as well as songs from their 
very first full album Breakfast 
— “Do You Want Nothing To Do 
with Me,” “Misty Morning” and 
“Shot” — they never lost touch 
of this transformative spark, 
consistently playing with such 
a level of passion that the crowd 
had no other option but to lose 
their feet in the rhythm and just 

dance. 

The highlight of Lawrence’s 

performance came through a song 
that didn’t originate as one they 
created but still made completely 
their own. Halfway through 
the set, the first few familiar 
notes of “Get Busy” by Sean 
Paul graced our ears. Then the 
next few notes were completely 
drowned out due to the volume of 
the crowd’s scream of approval. 
Enthusiasm 
was 
high, 
and 

Lawrence was grooving, finding 
a way to repurpose the song to 
fit their own specific abilities 
and allowing each band member 
to contribute their own personal 
style. What brought each of 
the various components of the 
performance together, however, 
was the vocal powerhouse duo 
of the Lawrence siblings, turning 
the song kaleidoscopic, cascading 
down onto the crowd like a disco

CONCERT REVIEW


“The 
Land 
of 
Steady 

Habits” opens with a mundane 
yet vaguely terrifying and 
seemingly 
endless 
supply 

of bath towels. And kitchen 
supplies. 
And 
toothbrush 

holders. All things that should 
mark a quintessential, white-
picket-fence life in suburbia. 
Instead, 
there’s 
barely 
a 

shadow of this lifestyle and, 
in its place, are the scattered 
remains of a financial shark’s 
attempt to go rogue. Though 
interesting in theory, “The 
Land of Steady Habits” never 
reaches a climax and remains 
a flat telling of rich white 
people and their problems.

In 
short, 
Netflix’s 
new 

family 
drama 
tackles 
the 

idea that the grass is always 
greener on the other side. Ben 
Mendelsohn (“Ready Player 
One”) has the air of a man 
who was, in his youth, a catch. 
This vibe perfectly matches 
that of his character, Anders, 
who gave up his family and job 
only to realize that not having 
a steady income can have a 
serious impact on a life rooted 
in an affluent Connecticut 
town. 

The most appealing part 

of this movie is the lack of 
in-your-face drama: Anders 
has already left his outwardly 
ideal 
life 
and 
the 
small 

community has adjusted to 
the split of one of its more 
prominent couples. The drama 
that does occur is tinged with 
the subtle tension of a rich 
white suburb that, rather than 

talking about their problems, 
ignores them with alcohol 
and drugs. The screaming 
matches that do occur are 
after someone pops a Xanax 
or one glass of red wine too 
many. The cutthroat nature 
of suburban parents whose 
reputation is at stake fosters 
the kind of crisis that makes 
“The Land of Steady Habits” 
such a compelling, and almost 
laughable, movie to watch. 

While the movie has its 

fair share of surface-level 

drama that’s expected when 
teenagers are doing drugs 
and parents are too involved 
with their own lives to care, 
“The Land of Steady Habits” 
also follows the tumultuous 
experience of being a parent. 
From listening to my parents 
talk about their peers to 
hearing 
new 
ones 
discuss 

the ever-evolving pressures, 
parenthood 
seems 
like 
a 

balancing act that no one has 
mastered. Worry too much and 
your kid might become distant 
and rebellious, care too little 
and the exact same thing can 
happen. The redemption arc 
that 
follows 
after 
Anders 

has a drug-induced epiphany 
about his relationship with his 
son Preston (Thomas Mann, 
“Me and Earl and the Dying 

Girl”) sends a compassionate 
message, that no matter how 
much we mess up there’s 
always going to be some way 
to fix the issue and get back 
the important things in your 
life. 

“Steady 
Habits” 
further 

pushes 
this 
message 
with 

all 
the 
parallels 
between 

Mendelsohn 
and 
Mann’s 

characters. Both Anders and 
Preston have stalled in their 
life, with Anders still hung 
up on his ex-wife and Preston 
living with his mother at 27 
with barely any job prospects. 
They both fool around in their 
lives: Preston with gambling 
and Anders with women, and 
when they realize their lives 
haven’t met their expectations 
both turn to alcohol. It takes 
the death of the endearing 
Charlie 
Ashford 
(Charlie 

Tahan, “I Am Legend”) to 
jar both of them from their 
stupors 
and 
propel 
them 

forward in their lives. Charlie, 
dead before his life even 
started, is what Preston could 
have been had his parents 
cared a little less and forces 
Anders to really consider how 
much he loves his wife and 
son and what he needs to do to 
regain their favor. 

Though supposedly living 

in a land of steady habits, 
it’s obvious that whatever 
these people are, they aren’t 
steady and it really shouldn’t 
be any other way. The movie 
ends with the cliché but 
inspiring message that there’s 
still 
time 
for 
redemption, 

whether you’re 27 getting 
off your parents’ couch or 
60-something and starting a 
new life with a pet turtle. 

How do we define an icon in 2018?

On 
July 
24, 
Gay 
Times 

Magazine tweeted out its Aug. 
2018 cover featuring singer and 
songwriter Lizzo.

“Baby, how you feelin’? GOOD 

AS HELL!” The tweet read. “Get 
to know the iconic singer whose 
body positivity, certified bangers 
and general IDGAF attitude 
have made her a true ally for the 
LGBTQ community.”

The replies came rushing in, 

most of them positive with a 
few notable exceptions. One, in 
particular, caught the musician’s 
eye.

“Ok, 
but 
calling 
Iconic 

someone 
who 
has 
56,000 

followers isn’t a little to much,” 
wrote 
user 
@LivingForMad. 

“Are we going to call now Iconic 
and legends everyone, that’s will 
mean nothing. And I really don’t 
have to know everyone.” [Sic.]

Lizzo was quick to retaliate. 

“MY WORTH = MY ART,” she 
shot back. “Not a number on an 
app.”

The exchange stuck with me 

for 
months 
to 

come, leaving me 
with 
questions 

that 
I 
never 

realized I wanted 
to ask. In true 
Carrie Bradshaw 
fashion, I couldn’t 
help but wonder: 
During the age 
of doing it for 
the ‘gram, what 
distinguishes an 
influencer 
from 

an icon?

Creative 

industries 
have 

always 
valued 

clout. It keeps them relevant, 
even to those who may not feel 
truly invested in entertainment 
or culture. The emergence of 
social media has given rise to a 

new means of quantifying one’s 
reputability: Today, the size of 
an artist’s following is examined 
with perhaps more scrutiny than 
the work they produce.

Few 
in 
the 

fashion industry 
better personify 
this shift than 
Virgil 
Abloh. 

Abloh, 
who 

counts 
Kanye 

West 
and 
Kid 

Cudi as friends 
and 
boasts 

2.7 
million 

Instagram 
followers, 
had 

no formal design 
experience 
before launching 
streetwear label 
Off-White 
in 

2012. Six years later, he was 
named the chief creative officer 
of Louis Vuitton menswear, a 
decision some industry experts 
have attributed to his heady 

Internet presence rather than 
the integrity of his work.

Though 
Abloh 
has 
only 

sent one collection down the 
runway so far, the brand’s parent 
company, Moët Hennessy Louis 
Vuitton (LVMH), has been quick 
to flaunt its shiny new “visionary” 
as the driving force behind its 
recent growth. According to The 
Fashion Law, LVMH’s first half 
report notes “the remarkable 
growth 
at 
Louis 
Vuitton” 

thanks to “the arrival of Virgil

Abloh, as Menswear Artistic 
Director, whose debut fashion 
show was widely commented 
on across social media, and was 
exceptionally 
well 
received.” 

The inclusion of the social 
media tidbit is definitive proof 
that 
LVMH 
views 
Abloh’s 

Internet following as an asset 
offering tangible returns. Yet 
the question remains: Does the 
devotion of millions of young 
hypebeasts 
equate 
to 
truly 

sustainable “success,” however 
we may choose to define that?

Should we choose to view 

success 
in 
financial 
terms, 

there are clear benefits to 
amassing a sizable following 
online — that is, if you’re 
comfortable 
commodifying 

your own existence. Take Kylie 
Jenner, who can charge up to $1 
million for an Instagram post 
advertising a product. No matter 
how you slice it, that’s one hell of 
a profit for little to no intensive 
labor.

But is the promotion of 

SugarBear Hair Vitamins what 
she’ll be remembered for? Or 
is there something going on 
beneath the surface, after the 
#PaidAds and follower counts 
are stripped away, that will 
permit Jenner to make a lasting 
impact on pop culture as we 
know it?

To some extent, mainstream 

media has always perpetuated 
the notion that “icon” status is a 
prize to be won via some tabloid-
driven 
popularity 
contest. 

However, not everyone places 
real value on that assessment. 
Many 
of 
the 
world’s 
most 

powerful 
tastemakers 
haven 

chosen to turn their back to 
others’ 
evaluations 
of 
their 

influence. After all, none of them 
asked for a world with social 
media in it — why should they 
feel obligated to embrace the 
tropes of the Instagram age? 
Just look at Lizzo, the songstress 
introduced sex-positive lyricism 
to the mainstream with far 
less followers than the average 
Instagram 
model, 
or 
Adam 

Selman, the mastermind behind 
the game-changing chainmail 
gown Rihanna wore to the 2014 
CFDA Awards; some of his posts 
don’t even hit a thousand likes 
(gasp!). Many of our culture’s 
most 
defining 
moments 
are 

created by those who couldn’t 
care less who watches them 
what they do. If anything, an 
artist’s decision to throw social 
norms to the wind makes them 
even more iconic.

Here’s 
what 
I 
think: 
A 

following can help an icon spread 
their message. That increased 
reach can allow them to touch 
more lives than ever, reaffirming 
the value of their work. But 
followers don’t make someone 
iconic. As Lizzo so candidly 
reminded us, it’s about what we 
do with real people in real life, 
not numbers on a tiny app on the 
tiny screen of a tiny phone in our 
(physically or metaphorically 
tiny) hand.

So 
yes, 
@LivingForMad. 

Lizzo is an icon, no matter how 
many followers she does or does 
not have. Not to beat the pun to 
death, but she has every right to 
feel good as hell about that.

During the age 
of doing it for 
the ‘gram, what 
distinguishes an 
influencer from 

an icon?

Behind Enemy Lines: A conversation with 
Nebraska football beat writer Jacob Bova

By MIKE PERSAK

Managing Sports Editor

In the softest part of its otherwise 
tough 
schedule, 
the 
Michigan 
football team has started to gain some 
momentum.
The 19th-ranked Wolverines (2-1) 
have dominated Western Michigan 
and SMU in the last two weeks, 
scoring a combined 94 points.
Now, though, things will begin 
to ramp up again for Michigan, as 
Nebraska (0-2) comes to Ann Arbor 
on Saturday, marking the start of Big 
Ten play.
The 
Cornhuskers 
have gotten off 
to a tough start in 
their first season 
under coach Scott 
Frost, falling to 
Colorado 
and 
Troy, 
both 
at 
home.
Nebraska 
quarterback 
Adrian Martinez 
suffered 
a 
leg 
injury 
against 
Colorado, and it’s possible that the 
Cornhuskers would be 2-0 if that 
hadn’t happened. Still, Nebraska 
seemingly hasn’t faced a team with 
Michigan’s talent.
The Daily caught up with Jacob 
Bova, a Nebraska football beat writer 
for The Daily Nebraskan, to talk 
about Cornhusker fans’ expectations 
for Frost, the health and ability 
of Martinez and predictions for 
Saturday’s game:
The Michigan Daily: With the 
first couple of losses, is there still a 
lot of faith in (Scott Frost) and a lot 
of hype for the program and where 
it’s headed? Or has it depleted at all? 
What’s your perspective on that?
Jacob Bova: I would say that a 
majority of Nebraska fans are going 
to give Scott Frost as much time as he 
needs to get this program right. There 
are like a few of those detractors that 
are already saying, like, ‘He’s 0-2. He’s 
not doing it.’ Those people are by far, 
they’re a loud minority. I feel like most 
Nebraskans will give Scott Frost the 
time he needs, and they have the faith 
that he will do the right thing. When 
he was at Nebraska as a quarterback 
and won the national title — by 
the way, we were the national title 
winners that year — anyways, 
when he won the national title that 

year, like, Scott Frost was loved by 
everyone. He’s always been someone 
that Nebraska fans — before he even 
got into coaching, he had some blogs 
that a lot of Nebraska fans followed. 
What he says has a lot of weight. And 
so, Scott Frost coming home, was 
like, it was seen by most Nebraskans 
as the only choice that Bill Moos, the 
athletic director, had. And people are 
gonna give him as much time as he 
needs. He just got a 7-year contract, 
so it’s like, I think most Nebraska fans 
are gonna be pretty patient with him.
TMD: Getting into the actual play 
this year, obviously Adrian Martinez 
goes down. Have you guys gotten any 
updates? Is he supposed to play this 
weekend? Does anybody know?
Bova: So what Frost said after 
the Troy game was that he looked 
good. And from what I saw from 
the sidelines during warmups, he 
was warming up, and there was no 
real, I mean, he had a brace on his 
knee, but he looks pretty close to 100 
percent, I would say. But at the end 
of the day, he didn’t practice until, I 
want to say (last week) Friday, I think 
— Thursday or Friday. So he didn’t 
practice until late in the week. This 
week, he’s practiced every day, and 
the offensive coordinator said that he 
looked better every day.
But this coaching staff is not one 
that’s going to risk putting him up 
against, I mean, Michigan’s d-line is 
for real, and our o-line hasn’t been the 
best. So he’ll be running a lot, and on 
a bad knee, if it’s still not 100 percent, 
there’s no way that Scott Frost is 
gonna risk it, especially since he’s a 
true freshman.
TMD: So if he doesn’t play, (backup 
quarterback Andrew) Bunch seemed 
to struggle a little bit. If you had to 
give a scouting report on Bunch, what 
would it be?
Bova: So for what he was told to 
do, he did an admirable job. The thing 
is, is what he was asked to do was not 
much. He didn’t offer any deep balls. 
I think he only had one completion 
when the ball went in the air for 15 
yards or more. So there was really no 
big play threat, yet, I mean, Nebraska 
has the receivers to do that. J.D. 
Spielman and Mike Williams are fast 
guys, and they can blow the top off a 
defense.
But, I don’t have enough faith in 
Bunch’s deep ball accuracy. Like he 
had a few throws deep that were just 
awful and into double coverage and 
that kind of thing. So honestly, Bunch 

starts, I have a hard time seeing 
Nebraska doing a lot. He’s a good 
enough athlete to where he can move 
the pocket, but he’s not a good enough 
athlete to run the read option, like, all 
the time.
I will say … if Martinez plays, what I 
would say is out of him, he’s a fantastic 
athlete. He’s a very good athlete, but 
also an underrated thrower. In the 
Colorado game, he had like a 50-yard 
pass to J.D. Spielman that was on a 
dime, like a perfect throw. And if he 
plays, first off, he’s going to be at 100 
percent, which means he’ll be able to 
run and do all that. So I would say if 
he plays, then I think that the game 
will get a little more interesting. If 
Bunch plays, I think it could be pretty 
ugly.
TMD: 
From 
an 
outsider’s 
perspective, a lot of the talk has been 
about the offense, … but I don’t know 
a ton about the defense. From what I 
can tell, the rush defense, pretty solid. 
The pass defense has been a little bit 
suspect, is that correct, or am I off on 
that?
Bova: No, that’s pretty accurate. 
I would say going into the year, a 
lot of people were asking questions 
about this defense. I mean, last year, 
the last three games, Nebraska gave 
up 50-plus points, and it was ugly. 
So there were a lot of questions 
going into this year of how the 
defense would look. But so far, the 
front seven has been, I think, has 
exceeded everyone’s expectations 
and have been very good. The game 

against Colorado, I’d say the corners, 
personally, I don’t think they played 
very bad. One of the corners, Dicaprio 
Bootle, this is his first year starting, 
and he’s physical and he’s played very 
well. The safeties in the Colorado 
game, I think is what cause a lot of the 
— Laviska Shenault, the wide receiver 
from Colorado, had a few where he 
just burned the defense. And I think 
that was a little more on the safeties 
than it was on the corners.
That being said, the Troy game last 
week, the secondary showed up. The 
secondary allowed — I think it was 
like 110 passing yards over the whole 
game. I mean, the defense, I’m more 
interested to see how they play against 
a team like Michigan, because, yeah, 
the rush defense’s numbers have been 
good, but it’s also been against Troy 
and Colorado, which are two teams 
that don’t run the ball very much.
And one last thing, the pass rush 
has been really good. They had seven 
sacks against Colorado and three last 
week against Troy. So, yeah, the pass 
rush has also been pretty potent.
TMD: Before the year, (did) you 
have a prediction of what you thought 
(Nebraska) would be? … What are 
your expectations for the rest of 
the year, and what would make a 
successful season for Nebraska?
Bova: So at the beginning of the 
year, I think 7-5 was seen as a decent 
number — like 7-5, maybe 8-4. But 
I guess there were pretty low-ish 
expectations, but also Nebraska’s 
schedule this year is brutal. I mean, 

we have to go to Michigan, to Ohio 
State, to Wisconsin, to Iowa and 
home against Michigan State. So it’s 
like, the schedule this year is brutal. 
And so, I think that 7-5, 6-6 or even 
8-4 were seen as probably like the 
baselines. Now? I mean, at this point, 
if Nebraska can get bowl eligible, that 
would be huge. That would require 
Nebraska, though, to win one of the 
Michigan, Michigan State, Ohio State, 
Wisconsin or Iowa games. Games that 
we’re gonna be significant underdogs 
in. You know, it requires us to win one 
of those and then not drop any of the 
other games. So, I think that if Scott 
Frost can get Nebraska to be bowl 
eligible this year, I think that would 
be seen as a success.
TMD: I know it’s hard to predict 
with the whole quarterback situation, 
but I want to ask you for a prediction. 
What do you think, score-wise, we’re 
looking at?
Bova: Earlier today, we have a 
podcast, and I had a score prediction 
21-9 Michigan. I feel like this game 
is gonna be pretty low-scoring. 
Michigan’s defense is for real. I think 
Nebraska’s defense is a lot better than 
what it was last year. But at the end 
of the day, I just don’t think that this 
team has enough — I don’t think this 
team is experienced enough and has 
had, I don’t know where the psyche is 
at this point. But I think the line was 
at like 18.5 or something like that, and 
I feel like that’s a little absurd. I think 
that might be a little much. But yeah, I 
said 21-9, I think, Michigan.

Nico Collins and the 
 light that switched
I 

n mid-August, as he does daily, Nico 
Collins called home after football 
practice. Only this conversation 
wasn’t a typical check-in for the 
sophomore wide receiver. It was one 

his dad, Don, had longed to hear.

“I asked him how he was doing,” Don said 

during a phone interview Thursday. “And he 
was like, ‘I’m ballin’. Those were his exact 
words: ‘I’m ballin’.’ ”

After just three catches for 27 yards in 2017, 

Collins had yearned to say those words, too. 
He knew he’d be limited his freshman season 
behind classmates Donovan Peoples-Jones and 
Tarik Black on the depth chart.

But Collins was having a fall camp that had 

Michigan players and coaches raving. And Don 
had never heard such confidence in his son.

“You never hear him brag about anything,” 

Don said. “When people asked about him in 
high school, I told them, ‘Nico is good, but Nico 
doesn’t know how good he can be.’ ”

So when Collins did brag last 

month, 
Don 
knew 
it 
was 

meaningful.

“I knew the 

lightbulb had finally gone off for him.”

***
Collins’ first sport was basketball, which he 

began playing when he was four. Eventually, 
he’d become one of the country’s top-ranked 
seventh and eighth graders on the AAU circuit.

One of his lifelong friends, Terell West, says 

he still “knows him as a basketball player.” 

West and Collins first met playing pee-wee 

football together in the suburbs of Birmingham, 
Alabama. Collins was a quarterback and 
running back then, sharing the field with two 
Division-I athletes in West — now a running 
back at Middle Tennessee State — and current 
Maryland quarterback Tyrrell Pigrome.

The trio moved on to star at Clay-Chalkville 

High School, where they were joined by now-
West Virginia receiver T.J. Simmons.

It was through competing with Simmons 

that 
Collins 
first 
flashed 

serious potential on the field.

“That’s when we found out he was gonna be 

a player,” West said. “Throughout the summer, 
we saw him as a long receiver, and we saw him 
competing with T.J. Simmons. We just saw 
them working and coming together, and he was 
just learning from (him). T.J. was a big-time 
mentor to Nico.”

Simmons was loud. Collins wasn’t. Though 

their personalities were at odds, the two quickly 
developed a strong bond and mentorship. 

“T.J. was the complete polar opposite,” said 

former-Clay-Chalkville offensive coordinator 
Stuart Floyd. “And some of those things helped 
Nico because T.J. played with an edge and a 
physicality that Nico didn’t really have at the 
time.”

Over the course of the year, Collins’ 

personality emerged. Before every game, he 

and Simmons would put on 

a “dance show of sorts” 

in Don’s words — just as 

Collins still does today.

“Man, it’s so fun 

when he’s opened up,” 
West said. “He’s so 
tall, just seeing him 
dance is fun. It just 

takes some time for it to 

come out. But he’s always 

been a character, just really 

funny.
“We kind of got him to open 

up towards the end of the year. 
Like I said, T.J. just being a 
mentor got him to break out of 
that shell.”

Collins broke out on the 

field, too. With him, Simmons, 
Pigrome and West all on the 
same side of the ball, Clay-

Chalkville rode an unstoppable 

offense to a state championship 

title in 2014.

“It’s probably the most fun I’ll ever 

have in my career,” Floyd said. “I’m 

not sure you’ll come across that many 

talented players at the same school at the same 
ttime. You could do pretty much anything you 
wanted to offensively.”

Collins amassed 2,000 yards over his final 

two seasons, becoming the state’s top-ranked 
recruit at receiver.

But even as his game soared, his humble 

personality persisted. That would a leave a 
lasting impression on Jerry Hood, legendary 
Clay-Chalkville coach who has since retired. 

Every day during practice, Collins would jog 

behind the offense and give Hood a bump or pat 
on the back. To others, it was a habit that went 
mostly unnoticed. But for Hood and Collins, it 
meant everything.

“He didn’t say much, but that was his way of 

saying, ‘I’m here coach. I’m enjoying this time,’ 
” Hood said. “I never will forget that, and I 
appreciated that about him.”

***
Alabama isn’t a recruiting hotbed for 

Michigan, and it’s no surprise why. Plucking 
recruits from the Deep South and Nick Saban 
isn’t easy.

“I think for most kids in Alabama, if Auburn 

or Alabama offers you,” Floyd said, “it’s pretty 
much expected that you’re going to one of the 
two.”

The Crimson Tide wanted Collins, especially. 

Of course, that’s where Simmons had just 
enrolled in the fall of 2016, and pressure to 
follow suit crowded Collins.

“I vividly remember seeing his face in the 

early part of the season just being really worn 
down,” Hood said. “T.J. was at Alabama at 
the time, and everybody was talking about 
Alabama.”

So Hood met with Collins individually and 

gave his receiver permission to stop answering 
calls. Dozens of schools had offered Collins, 
and out of politeness, he had been answering 
everything that came his way.

But there was one school Collins really didn’t 

mind hearing from: Michigan. After all, Don — 
a Detroit native — was a “huge” Wolverines fan.

So 
Collins 
asked 
the 
Clay-Chalkville 

coaching staff to send Michigan his tape. 

LIGHT THAT SWITCHED

FootballSaturday, September 21, 2018

The Wolverines had never heard of 
Collins, but just days after watching 
his tape, they flew staff down to 
Alabama.

“Nico 
actually 
recruited 

Michigan,” Floyd said. “It wasn’t 
Michigan going after him originally, 
truth be told.”

Collins first met Jim Harbaugh 

with a bag of Dairy Queen in his 
hands. It wasn’t long before the 
coach wanted some of his own.

“Harbaugh just stuck his hand 

right in Nico’s bag, grabbed some 
fries out and started eating them,” 
Hood said. “(It) was like they had 
known each other for forever, which 
was pretty awesome.

“He just had himself a good old 

Jim Harbaugh time.”

Collins must not have minded 

the sacrifice in fries. For all the odd 
anecdotes Harbaugh has created on 
the recruiting trail, he left a folksier 
impression in Birmingham. Collins 
would take multiple unofficial visits 
to Ann Arbor before committing in 
February of his senior year.

“(Harbaugh) was very, very down 

to Earth,” Floyd said. “He and I 
talked about emojis just because we 
wear similar glasses. … He’s pretty 
cool, man. He’s not like a lot of 
coaches, and Nico liked that.”

***
Three years later, Collins has 

indeed 
started 
to 
shine 
under 

Harbaugh.

Taking over a starting role for 

the 
injured 
Black, 
Collins 
has 

five catches for 113 yards and a 
touchdown in three games. He 
maintains the team’s highest 
yard-per-catch mark while 
blossoming into a reliable 
deep threat for Shea 
Patterson. 

In the season-

opener at Notre 
Dame, Collins 
caught 
a 

52-yard 
bomb 
from 
the 

junior quarterback to open the 
second half. A week later, Collins 
caught his first career touchdown 
on another deep ball — this time a 
44-yard connection against Western 
Michigan. It was the first score in 
364 days for a Wolverines receiver.

“Everybody’s 
always 
seen 

potential in him,” Patterson said. 
“Even last year in film, I remember 
watching this tall, lanky guy — very 
athletic and fast.”

So what’s been the difference 

in Collins realizing this potential? 
Unprompted, Patterson gave part of 
the answer during a press conference 
Wednesday.

“(It was) believing in himself a 

little bit more,” Patterson said. “… 
Just him knowing that he’s kinda 
that guy.”

Collins knows his career is far 

from finished, but he talks about 
his NFL dreams with his family 
occasionally. He wants to continue 
becoming faster and stronger, 
hoping to model the skill sets 
of Randy Moss, Josh Gordon 
and DeAndre Hopkins.

With plays like those 

he 
made 
against 

Notre 
Dame 

and 
Western 

Michigan, 
that’s 

becoming more of a reality.

“God willing, he stays healthy, and 

if he does, there’s no telling where he 
could go,” Don said. “Heck, Hall of 
Fame.”

A lot separates Collins from a gold 

jacket. But Collins now believes that 
the sky’s the limit, and that’s what is 
truly important.

“I think he realizes that he 

can be really good,” Don 
said. “And I think after the 
conversation we had in 
fall camp, the light 
just came on for 
him.

“It was time 

to rock n’ 
roll.”

Breakdown: Michigan vs. Nebraska

By MAX MARCOVITCH 

Daily Sports Editor

Michigan opens up Big Ten 
play with a matchup against 
Nebraska that seemed far more 
intriguing a few weeks ago. The 
Cornhuskers (0-2) came from 
14 points down in their season 
opener 
against 
Colorado 
to 
take a 28-20 lead, then handed 
the game right back after true 
freshman quarterback Adrian 
Martinez left the game with a leg 
injury.
The 
next 
week, 
without 
Martinez, Nebraska fell to Troy 
— an embarassing loss on its face, 
but a slightly less embarassing 
defeat 
given 
the 
Trojans’ 
understated quality.
Still, the Wolverines (2-1) 
come into this game an 18-point 
favorite for a reason. Nebraska is 
on its first six-game losing streak 
since 1957, as the Scott Frost 
era has begun with a turbulent 
start. For the Cornhuskers, this 
game is a chance to right the 
ship (coaches have referenced 
“Rocky” in the run-up to this 
one). For Michigan, it’s the 
opening of a Big Ten season filled 
with pressure to perform. The 
Daily breaks down Saturday’s 
matchup:

Michigan’s pass offense vs. 
Nebraska’s defense

If Nebraska is going to win, 
it seems like two things need to 
go right. One of those requires 
the Cornhuskers’ defensive line 
taking advantage of Michigan’s 
inconsistent 
pass 
protection. 
Nebraska has 10 sacks in two 
games this season, the second-
highest per-game total of any 
team in the country. Though 
the Cornhuskers have plenty of 
questions, their front seven will 
pose a test for a unit that hasn’t 
been tested since the debacle at 
Notre Dame. If Nebraska can 
get 
junior 
quarterback 
Shea 
Patterson and co. into obvious 
passing downs, there’s reason to 
believe they’ll have some success.
Of course, that’s easier said 
than done.
Patterson has opened the 
season as well as any Michigan 
quarterback in quite some time, 
completing over 70 percent of 
his passes for 589 yards and six 
touchdowns. Patterson said this 
week he has “never been this 
comfortable in a system.” All of 

a sudden, external pleas have 
come to unleash the offense — to 
open up Patterson’s skillset and 
allow more than the present 22 
pass attempts per game.
Nebraska 
isn’t 
SMU 
or 
Western Michigan; this is a 
legitimate test to see whether 
strides have been made in the 
passing game since Sep. 1, 
or whether the recent run of 
success has been a mirage.

Advantage: Michigan

Michigan’s run offense vs. 
Nebraska’s defense

Michigan could have Brett 
Favre in his prime at quarterback 
and it wouldn’t run a full-on air 
raid attack. While the passing 
game has been the talk of the 
town, the Wolverines — who run 

the same percentage of running 
plays as they do passing plays — 
will continue to rely on balance.
This week, that comes with 
the caveat of health. Junior 
running backs Karan Higdon 
and 
Chris 
Evans 
are 
both 
recovering from injuries. Both 
have practiced this week. When 
asked 
whether 
they 
would 
play Saturday, Jay Harbaugh 
responded 
“that’s 
what 
we 
expect.” Against a formidable 
Big Ten foe, at a position of 
relatively scant depth, that’s 
an important development, if it 
holds true.
Nebraska 
has 
allowed 
a 
respectable 278 yards on the 
ground in two weeks. But Troy 
and Colorado didn’t possess the 
duo that Higdon and Evans can 
become when healthy.

Advantage: Michigan

Nebraska’s pass offense vs. 
Michigan’s defense

It 
looks 
like 
Nebraska 
quarterback Adrian Martinez 
will play, as he was upgraded 
from 
“questionable” 
to 
“probable” on Thursday. 
It may seem inconsequential to 
some whether the true freshman 
Martinez starts or if the nod goes 
to walk-on sophomore Andrew 
Bunch. 
But in an offense that relies 
heavily on its quarterback’s 
skillset, Martinez has the tools 
to be special. In his start this 
year against Colorado, he posted 
187 yards and a touchdown 
on 15-of-20 pass attempts, in 
addition to 15 carries for 117 
yards and two touchdowns on 

the ground. He was the offense. 
And when he left the game with 
a leg injury, the Cornhuskers 
held a 28-27 lead. He left, they 
lost, then lost against the next 
week to Troy with Martinez 
watching on.
Martinez will give Michigan 
a test in discipline similar to 
the one it faced against Brandon 
Wimbush 
in 
the 
opener. 
Wimbush kept the Wolverines’ 
defense honest with the threat 
of quarterback runs and ability 
to escape the pocket. On the run, 
Wimbush was able to effectively

find his open receivers early 
in the game, enough to put up 21 
points in the blink of an eye.
Martinez may not have the 
weapons around him nor the 
experience to do that on this stage. 
But he has the skill.
Still, if Michigan’s defense 
can avoid the over-aggression 
that plagued it early against 
Notre Dame, you have to like its 
chances against a true freshman 
quarterback in a new system at 
Michigan Stadium. 
(An aside: Martinez is going to 
be a problem in the Big Ten for 
the next few years. He’s brimming 
with talent, and he’s in the right 
place at the right time.)

Advantage: Michigan

Nebraska’s run offense vs. 
Michigan’s defense

Some of this is covered in the 
section above, but Nebraska’s 
run 
attack 
is 
multi-pronged. 
There are lots of moving parts, 
motioning, options and more. 
Martinez orchestrates it all — 
he will probably end the game 
with the most carries, too — but 
he’s certainly not alone in the 
backfield.

After 
being 
ejected 
for 
targeting in the third quarter 
last week, junior VIPER Khaleke 
Hudson will have to sit for the first 
half. Defending Martinez and all 
those moving parts will be where 
Michigan misses Hudson most. 
In all likelihood, senior Jordan 
Glasgow will slot into the VIPER 
spot in Hudson’s absence.
There are three Cornhuskers 
with at least 20 carries on the 
year. Greg Bell and Maurice 
Washington both average over 5.5 
yards per carry. Devine Ozigbo, 
who’s been less effective early this 
season, will also figure into the 
equation.
This is an offense predicated 
on space and decision-making. 
The space they have been able to 
find, offering promising glimpes 
of what the Scott Frost offense 
could become in the years to come. 
The deicision-making has lagged 
behind, and it has led to some 
expected mistakes this season. 
The Cornhuskers have averaged 
two more turnovers per game 
than their opponents this season, 
which is tied for 126th of 129, 
nationally. For now, the mistakes 
are going to be enough to hold 
this offense back; the roster depth 
is also not up to nearly where it 

needs to be in the aftermath of the 
Mike Riley era.
All that being said, this is 
almost certainly not the caliber of 
offense Michigan will see when 
it plays Frost and Nebraska down 
the line. For now, Michigan’s 
(generally) stout run defense 
holds the advantage.

Advantage: Michigan

Special Teams

Michigan’s 
special 
teams 
remain a surprising team strength. 
Sophomore kick returner Ambry 
Thomas is still a threat to take 
any kickoff to the endzone. Junior 
punter Will Hart ranks sixth 
in the nation in yards per punt, 
averaging 50.1 yards per punt. 
Both kickers are certifiably 
iffy in this one. Quinn Nordin has 
made two of his three field goal 
attempts this season, Nebraska 
kicker Barret Pickering has made 
just two of four, none over 40 
yards.
Frankly, if this game comes 
down to special teams, things 
have gone astray for Michigan.

Advantage: Michigan

Intangibles

How 
about 
this 
for 
an 
intangible: Many Michigan fans 
are convinced Scott Frost robbed 
them of an undisputed national 
championship 
in 
1997. 
His 
Nebraska team was ranked No. 2 
in the nation, behind Michigan. 
Both teams won their bowl games 
— the Cornhuskers did so a bit 
more convincingly against Peyton 
Manning’s Tennessee team. After 
the game, Frost (a quarterback for 
Nebraska at the time) suddenly 
turned into a politician.
“You know, if all the pollsters 
honestly think, after watching 
the Rose Bowl and watching the 
Orange Bowl, that Michigan could 
beat Nebraska, go ahead and vote 
Michigan, by all means,” he said. 
“Let me say this. Let me say this. 
But I don’t think there’s anybody 
out there that with a clear 
conscience can say that Nebraska 
and especially that (coach) Tom 
Osborne, that great man, doesn’t 
deserve a national championship 
for this. At least a share.”
And so, a share it was. Michigan 
topped the AP Poll, Nebraska 
claimed the coaches poll. And 
forever, Frost lives in Michigan 
infamy.

But the history with Frost and 
Michigan didn’t end there. In 
2016, he told reporters he was 
proud that his team had “outhit” 
the Wolverines — this coming 
after a 51-14 drubbing. He’s 
thrown subtle jabs at Harbaugh’s 
antics. Nebraska’s prodigal son, 
Frost has even been crowned the 
next Harbaugh.
Come gametime, it all might 
mean nothing (for what it’s worth, 
chatter this weak has remained 
cordial). But let’s just say if it’s not 
close, don’t expect Michigan to 
ease off the pedal until the clock 
hits 0:00.

Edge: Nebraska, I guess?

Prediction

 This is one of those games that 
probably shouldn’t be close, but 
just might be anyway. Nebraska 
comes in with nothing to lose and 
everything to gain. For Michigan, 
it’s vice versa. Those games are 
inherently dangerous.
But it just seems highly unlikely 
a 0-2 team starting a freshman 
quarterback with iffy health wins 
this game on the road.

What to Watch For: Nebraska

By ETHAN WOLFE

Daily Sports Writer

Big Ten football is in full swing in 
Ann Arbor. You can feel it in the air. 
It starts Saturday, with the Michigan 
football team’s matchup against first-
year coach Scott Frost and Nebraska 
(0-2 overall). Prior to the start of the 
season, some expected a contentious 
head-to-head between two resurgent 
programs. 
For 
the 
19th-ranked 
Wolverines (2-1), that remains to be 
seen. For the Cornhuskers, that ship 
has seemingly sailed.
Nebraska visits Michigan Stadium 
coming off a heartbreaking home 
loss to Troy, while Michigan is 
riding a two-game win streak with 
momentum in tow.
The Daily breaks down what 
to watch for in Saturday’s Big Ten 
opener.

Patterson’s other peoples

Sophomore 
wide 
receiver 
Donovan Peoples-Jones finally gave 
credence to the five-star hype against 
SMU. The Detroit native scored 
three touchdowns in Saturday’s 
45-20 win in different ways — a deep 
crossing route, a back shoulder fade 
and a go route. Now we know what 
he is capable of, but can he continue 
doing it (at a more reasonable rate, of 
course)?
So far, nothing points against the 
contrary. Junior quarterback Shea 
Patterson acknowledged an improved 
rapport with Peoples-Jones that 
could see more balls thrown his way.
“(Donovan’s) a freak athlete,” 
Patterson said. “He’s very smart, very 
fast, great football size to him. I know 
if I throw it up, there’s a lot of trust in 
him (to make the catch).”
But Peoples-Jones is only one 
athlete in the deep wide receiving 
corps. 
And 
with 
Nebraska’s 
uninspiring secondary, that depth 
could become more pronounced. 
Sophomore Nico Collins made waves 
with a 44-yard touchdown against 
WMU and 52-yard reception at Notre 
Dame, but was quiet facing SMU. 
Collins, along with Oliver Martin and 
Grant Perry to round out the next 
three wide receiver options, have 
combined for just 16 receptions to 
Peoples-Jones’ 14.
Their opportunities may come 
in the future, though. Junior right 
guard Mike Onwenu said only about 
half the playbook has been used 
through three games as the team has 
more complex schemes drawn up for 
the latter half of the season. Senior 
Tyree Kinnel mentioned that trio 

of receivers as emerging players in 
practice, too.
The oft-referenced stat of only 
three wide receiver touchdowns in 
2017 has faded into the background. 
That number has already doubled 
the past two games, and the new 
offensive installations could also 
include expanded receiving roles for 
the tight ends and running backs. A 
matchup against the Cornhuskers 
could be a good litmus test for how 
other receivers get involved.

Secondary progression

The nation’s No. 1 secondary from 
a year ago, to put it mildly, hasn’t 
replicated that production with the 
same, more experienced players 
thus far. But if walk-on quarterback 
Andrew Bunch starts under center 
for Nebraska, the defensive backs 
could have a field day defending 
rushed throws.
That’s not to say the Cornhuskers 
don’t boast talented receivers. Their 
two primary options — Stanley 
Morgan Jr. and J.D. Spielman — 
have over half the team’s receiving 
production in its first two contests.
Michigan cornerbacks also have 
shown a proclivity towards giving 
up big yardage. Just last week against 
SMU, wide receiver James Proche ran 
rampant, collecting 11 receptions for 
166 yards and two touchdowns. One 
of Proche’s scores included a 50-yard 
bomb opened up from a coverage 

miscommunication between Brad 
Hawkins and David Long.
“It’s not like they flat out beat us,” 
said junior safety Josh Metellus. “It 
was more on what we did. We knew 
he was a big play guy for them; we 
knew he was the number one guy for 
them. And we didn’t do a great job of 
playing to that. We didn’t do a great 
job of knowing when he’s gonna get 
the ball and put on double coverage 
or just make sure we watch him. He’s 
a good player, but we go against good 
wide receivers every day.”
All 
of 
Michigan’s 
defensive 
shortcomings 
must 
also 
be 
contextualized. The unit has given 
up the 16th fewest passing yards per 
game on average, which is still pretty 
darn good. But for a Don Brown 
secondary that was the crown jewel 
of college football last year, it has to 
prove that it can continue to play at a 
College Football Playoff level.

Cleaning up their act

The worst kept secret is the entire 
defense’s 
propensity 
to 
commit 
penalties. Michigan has committed 
an astonishing 27 penalties through 
three games, 21 of them on the 
defensive side of the ball. Nebraska’s 
ability to instigate mistakes by 
the Wolverines is a tough bet. But 
after only a week of practice since 
a 13-penalty game, it’s in the realm 
of the possibility that the issue 
persists and keeps Saturday’s game 

uncomfortably close for Michigan.
“You address each of them,” 
Harbaugh said of the penalties. “… 
And penalties are hurting us. That’s 
something we have to clean up and 
get better at. We address each one 
— technique, what we’re using, the 
discipline that we have. Get them 
corrected, get them coached, get 
improved. Don’t want 13 penalties in 
a game. Don’t think anybody does.”
Kinnel 
mentioned 
that 
the 
secondary discusses the committed 
penalties amongst each other. But 
the senior captain also reinforced 
the notion that it’s a unit with a 
particularly short memory, evidenced 
by Metellus’ pick six against SMU.
But 
interception 
return 
touchdowns are few and far between. 
If the flags continue to pile up, it 
could spell trouble in the future as 
thrown flags become a symptom of 
an uncharacteristically undisciplined 
defense.
From strictly a playing perspective, 
If the offensive line demonstrates 
improvement, then all of the on-field 
talent can be Big Ten Championship 
level. But then, playing with reckless 
abandon becomes the new top 
priority. In week four against a Big 
Ten opponent, we should see the 
frequency of penalties decline.

Bottom line and prediction

A loss at home to Troy is 
unexpected. A loss at Michigan with a 

quarterback facing the most talented 
defense in his football career is not.
The 
Wolverines 
should 
have 
another cakewalk ahead of them, 
with an opportunity for the defense 
to play disciplined and dominate. Oh, 
and don’t forget that Shea Patterson 
guy. He’s been pretty good.
