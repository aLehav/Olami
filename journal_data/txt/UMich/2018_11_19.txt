Trinitas Ventures is taking legal 
action against Ann Arbor after 
City Council denied a proposal for 
a student housing complex north 
of campus. The Indiana-based 
developer filed a claim of appeal, 
arguing the project complies with 
relevant zoning regulations and 
calling for a reversal of the city’s 
decision on the development.
In September, City Council 
rejected the proposal — in which 
Trinitas planned to construct the 
complex at 2601 Pontiac Trl., more 
than two miles away from both 
North and Central Campus — in 
a unanimous vote. Then, in 
November, it voted unanimously 

in favor of a $150,000 contract 
to retain outside legal counsel to 
fight the developer’s claim against 
the city.
City Councilmember Zachary 
Ackerman, D-Ward 3, said despite 
the fact legal precedents in the 
state tend to favor developers, 
he was pleased the council was 
taking action to block the Trinitas 
plan.
“Precedent is set by our court 
system and generally not by 
legislative branches, and the 
precedent that’s been set in 
the state of Michigan protects 
developers who believe they have 
the right to build a certain way on 
a property,” Ackerman said. 

Between alumni, parents and 
general Michigan fans, people 
flock to Ann Arbor on Saturdays 
during the fall. The Ann Arbor 
Airbnb host community has 
seen this firsthand and earned 
$1.55 million in supplemental 
income from 8,900 guests during 
University of Michigan home 
football game weekends this 
season, according to Airbnb. This 
included 
the 
$117,000 
in 
projected 
income 
from 
the 
Indiana game on Saturday.
The $1.55 million in Airbnb 
income is up from $1.2 million 
during the 2017 football season. 
Janice Cutting, an Airbnb host of 
several local properties, said she 
has no trouble finding guests for 
football weekends.
“If you have a football game, 
clearly the demand is much 
higher and you can raise your 
price,” Cutting said. “But when 
it’s a little bit slower, you need to 
lower your prices.”
Cutting 
is 
a 
Superhost, 
meaning she has a 4.8 rating or 
higher, a 90-percent response 
rate and zero cancellations. 
After staying in above-average 
Airbnb properties, Cutting said 
she wanted to provide her guests 
with an excellent experience. 
Cutting provides coffee, creamer 
and soap products for her guests, 
and 
she 
hires 
professional 
cleaners between each guest.
“About 80 percent of the time 
they’re booked,” Cutting said. 

“When I first started out, my 
prices were a little bit lower and 
I used to get them booked up in 
the 90 to 95 percent of the time. 
But when I’m pricing it lower 
I have found that you don’t get 
quite as nice a clientele, so they 
didn’t treat the properties quite 
as well.”
Jack Savas, also a local Airbnb 
Superhost, decided to use his 
home for Airbnb because he 
travels often and his daughter 
attends college overseas. After 

four years as a host, Savas said he 
has learned communication and 
honesty is essential to finding 
guests who will respect the 
property.
“Surprisingly, 
I’ve 
had 
excellent guests,” Savas said. 
“In many cases, they leave 
the house cleaner than when 
they arrive. But I think the 
key to maintaining a residence 
that’s clean and immaculate is 
transparency with the guests 
and pricing your house at the 

right amount of money.”
Savas currently maintains two 
Airbnb properties and is planning 
on listing a third. Especially for 
hosts who maintain multiple 
properties, Savas said Airbnb 
can present a great opportunity 
for earning extra income.
“A peak month I did $14,600 
but on average on average I earn 
between $5,000 and $7,000,” 

Students and faculty gathered 
Friday night for a Native American 
Heritage Month event, a historical 
discussion of the Burt Lake 
Burnout led by historian Richard 
Wiles and the Burt Lake Tribal 
Council. The event first centered 
around the history of the Burt Lake 
Band of Ottawa and Chippewa 
Indians, and later discussed the 
band’s ongoing struggle to achieve 
federal tribal recognition.
On Oct. 15, 1900, the government 
forced the relocation of the Burt 
Lake Band of Chippewa and 
Ottawa Native Americans, burning 
their village and giving the land to 
a local developer who claimed to 
have purchased the property. The 
University later gained ownership 
of some of this property in 1909, 
and the U-M Biological Station 
currently sits on this land.
Last December, native students 
and faculty submitted a request 
to the University to investigate 
the land ownership belonging to 
the Burt Lake Band of Ottawa 
and Chippewa Native American

Workshop talks combatting white

Michigan Student Power Network centered the workshop on importance of collective action 

In response to the growing 
visibility 
of 
white 
nationalist 
movements across the country 
and 
subsequent 
debates 
about 
free speech, the social justice 

nonprofit Michigan Student Power 
Network hosted a workshop Friday 
afternoon about the power of 
community organizing and action. 
The workshop was one of many 
events hosted during the conference 
“Building 
Power: 
Organizing 
Effectively 
Against 
White 
Supremacy,” which discussed topics 
like nonviolence and the Black 

Action movement.
Inspiration for the conference, 
which described itself as “Black-
led,” stemmed from controversial 
events last year that received 
pushback 
from 
students 
and 
campus 
organizations. 
In 
November 2017, white supremacist 
Richard 
Spencer’s 
request 
to speak at the University of 

Michigan incited protests from 
the Black Student Union and the 
University’s chapter of the NAACP. 
Spencer cancelled his request to 
speak in January and canceled all 
national college tours after violence 
broke out at his stop at Michigan 
State University.

The 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 66th Annual Economic 
Outlook 
Conference 
discussed 
research on the national and state 
economic future, especially as a 
recession rapidly approaches. The 
program’s 10 presentations, held 
between Thursday and Friday, 
spanned talks from “Election 
Implications for Small Business 
Spending and Hiring” to “NAFTA, 
Tariffs, and the U.S. Automotive 
Industry.”
The conference was organized 
by the Research Seminar in 
Quantitative 
Economics, 
a 
modeling and forecasting unit in 
the Economics Department that 
provides quarterly forecasts for 
the U.S. and Michigan economies. 
The conference is the longest 
running one of its kind in the 
U.S. , and is attended by upper 
level government and business 
economists, economic analysts, 
and academics.
RSQE Director Gabriel Ehrlich 
spoke about Michigan’s economic 
outlook at the conference on Friday.

an LSA senior who helped lead 
the workshop, said the discussion 
was intended to challenge the 
belief that individual action is the 
best way to create meaningful 
change. Instead, Pham stressed 

the effectiveness of community 
activism.
“How many of you have heard 
the phrase, ‘Be the change you 
want to see in the world?’” Pham 
asked. 
“With 
our 
workshop 
based on collective action and 
saying why individual action isn’t 
enough, the meaning behind this 
phrase or the way that people have 

construed it is a little bit harmful. 
It perpetuates the idea that in 
order to see the change that we 
want to see in the world, to see a 
problem and want to change it, it’s 
individual responsibility.”
Pham noted how issues like 
white 
supremacy 
cannot 
be 
confronted by individual action 
because they are often systemic. 
The workshop discussed 
nationwide 
movements 
such as the Women’s March 
that has failed to address 
white 
supremacy. 
LSA 
senior Chanelle Davis, who 
also led the discussion, said 
the lack of Black student 
representation in meetings 
about Spencer’s proposed 
visit turned her off even 
though she was invested in 
the cause.
“Although 
the 
collaboration got it done 
— Spencer didn’t come — 
it was missing that piece 
about building sustainable 
organizing 
spaces 
and 
groups and relationships 
with folks,” Davis said.
Davis also mentioned 
how 
communities 
need 
to 
acknowledge 
the 
differences of opinion and 
background among their 
members.
“We 
each 
possess 
unique 
experiences 
and 
also different identities and 
we also face oppressions 
differently and at different 
levels, and we also have 

some privileges and things like 
that,” Davis said. “But everyone 
has a place in the larger work for 
justice.”
Kaitlyn Wilson, a Master’s 
student 
at 
the 
School 
of 
Social 
Work, 
acknowledged 
the 
uncertainty 
some 
white 
people may feel with their role 
in 
organizing 
against 
white 
supremacy. 
However, 
she 
expressed the importance of 
utilizing racial privilege to help 
dismantle it.
“I am a white woman,” Wilson 
said. “For me, something like 
this, I might feel like maybe I’m 
not welcome because I’m kind of 
the group that we’re organizing 
against, but I think it’s important 
that white people like myself 
are also able to be a part of it and 
acknowledge our own privilege 
and use it to work towards 
dismantling white supremacy.”
Workshop attendees discussed 
what holds them back from 
pursuing 
opportunities 
for 
activism, as well as movements 
that have not been successful in 
combating white supremacy. One 
attendee brought up the decline 
in the labor movement, while 
another mentioned how the 
“we’re all immigrants” sentiment 
disregards 
the 
historical 
oppression of Native Americans 
and African Americans. Pham 
said revisiting the history of 
marginalized groups is crucial 

A VIEW OF THE SNOW

It was the last of many for 
University of Michigan seniors: 
a willingness to wake up early 
for tailgates (unlike classes), 
singing 
“Mr. 
Brightside” 
with 100,000 spectators and 
enjoying a football game at the 
Big House as undergraduates.
The 
Michigan 
football 
team beat Indiana University 31 
to 20.
Engineering senior Rachel 
Fenberg has gone to football 
games since her freshman year, 

and gained appreciation for 
the experience as she attended 
more games.
“I love the atmosphere of the 
Big House and I always look 
forward to going to games,” 
Fenberg said. “I think as I have 
gotten older, I’ve been able to 
appreciate it more and now as 
a senior with the team being 
so amazing, it’s been really 
exciting to be a part of the 
student section and watch all 
the games.”

LSA senior Rachel Cohen 
felt bittersweet about a great 
experience coming to an end.
“It’s really bittersweet for 
me,” Cohen said. “As a freshman, 
I didn’t know anything about 
football. I started staying at 
the games and getting more 
invested in it so eventually now 
over the course of four years I 
started understanding football 
and I really loved staying for 
all the games. It’s really sad for 
that to be over.”

Seniors 
at 
the 
game 
expressed sadness as two of 
its players, LSA senior Chase 
Winovich 
and 
Rackham 
student 
Berkley 
Edwards, 
both sustained injuries in the 
second half and did not return 
to the game. The athletes were 
transported to the hospital, but 
reports show they sustained less 
severe injuries than expected.
Michigan will take on Ohio 
State University next Saturday 
in Columbus.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
Michigan in Color
Monday, November 19, 2018— 3A

A headline from The Michigan 
Daily 
reads 
“Conservative 
commentator Steven Crowder 
critiques erasure of conservative 
voices 
on 
campus.” 
As 
a 
photographer for The Daily, my 
editor assigned me to cover a 
live taping of his show, Louder 
with Crowder, on Oct. 25 at the 
Power Center. Crowder had the 
nerve to claim “no one is othered 
on college campuses more than 
conservatives.” Unbeknownst to 
me, what was to ensue was, as a 
person of color, one of the most 
terrifying events of my life.
I walked into Power Center to 
be rudely greeted by a University 
of Michigan police officer, who 
begrudgingly let me talk to the 
event organizer who directed 
me to the press area. Walking 
into the main auditorium felt 
like walking from the dungeons 
into the Coliseum as a gladiator. 
The auditorium was with over 
1,381 
people 
in 
attendance, 
almost all clad in the Trumpian 
uniform of red MAGA hats and 
white rage. Crowder was late. 
His fans were getting anxious 
and unruly. Chants of “We want 
Crowder!” broke out through 
the audience, gaining power and 
zeal with each passing minute.
Finally, the “Arthur”-voice-
actor-turned-white-nationalist 
peeked out from behind the 

curtain, to be met with a roar 
and a raucous chant of “U.S.A.!” 
Crowder did a victory lap on 
stage, 
dressed 
as 
Supreme 
Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh 
wearing a red MAGA beer 
hat, spilling one of the cans of 
Miller Light onto the floor when 
the hat tumbled off his head. 
Getting settled, some of the very 
first words out of his mouth 
constituted a threat, instructing 
the audience to hold up their 
phones to show “the media” that 
they have their own account. 
The crowd obliged, shining their 
phone flashlights onto me and 
the other photographers present 
while hissing a menacing jeer.
I stayed as long as was 
necessary to take enough photos; 
on account of reporters getting 
harassed and assaulted at 45’s 
rallies, and especially cognizant 
of my perilous position as one 
of the few Brown people in 
the room, I left out of fear for 
my own safety. Even if I didn’t 
feel endangered, I still would 
have left – I tested my patience 
by withstanding roughly 20 
minutes of blatant homophobia, 
transphobia, 
misogyny 
and 
racism before I felt like my 
stomach was going to vomit up 
all of the hate that my eyes and 
ears had ingested.
Shortly 
after 
coming 
on, 
he described to the audience 
in 
great 
detail 
about 
how 
beautiful 
and 
lovely 
his 
assistant was: comments that 

were patronizing and clearly 
made her uncomfortable. He 
continued on a 15-minute tirade 
mocking 
transgender 
people 
and 
gender 
identity, 
egged 
on by the audience’s raucous 
laughter. Not satisfied with only 
spewing vitriol against women 
and the LGBTQ community, 
Crowder aimed to prove he 
was also well-versed in racism 
and xenophobia, 
interspersing 
his 
show 
with 
a 
running 
joke 
mocking 
a 
Honduran 
immigrant being 
interviewed 
by 
CNN.
Crowder 
never 
explicitly 
attacked any of 
my identities as 
a person of color, 
which may leave 
some white folks 
wondering 
why 
the 
experience 
was 
so 
terrifying. 
Being 
surrounded by a large, unruly 
crowd composed almost entirely 
of white people would give any 
person of color pause, even if 
they hadn’t congregated for a 
colloquium of hate. Crowder 
and other members of the 
so-called “alt-right” (read: white 
supremacists) have not hesitated 
to espouse loathsome ideology 
against people who look like 
me before. Given the history of 

white violence against racial 
minorities in this country, and 
its recent encouragement by the 
fascist demagogue in the White 
House, I had every reason to be 
on my guard. This was a situation 
during which the threat of 
violence was ever present. To 
exacerbate the threat, the police, 
representing the authority of 
the state, were sent to protect 
this odious pundit 
from facing any 
pushback against 
his 
opinions. 
I 
have 
personally 
experienced 
enough 
misconduct 
at 
the hands of the 
police 
to 
know 
they were more 
likely 
to 
cause 
me 
harm 
than 
give me help in 
the 
event 
that 
something 
did 
occur. According 
to 
political 
scientist Iris Young, one of the 
five faces of oppression is not 
only violence itself, but also 
the constant threat of violence 
because of one’s membership in 
a social group.
Whenever 
I 
hear 
some 
white boy crybabying about 
how conservatives and whites 
are the ones who are actually 
discriminated against, I always 
want to laugh, but too many 
white people across the country 

share 
the 
same 
ignorant, 
uninformed 
opinion 
for 
me 
to dismiss it this easily. The 
opinions espoused by extreme 
conservatives like Crowder are 
directly contributing to the 
propagation of systems of white 
supremacy. As a person who is 
directly threatened by this, I 
have every right to push back. 
This is not discrimination, this 
is self-defense. Conservatives 
on college campuses are not 
exploited, are not marginalized, 
are not powerless or threatened 
by 
violence: 
the 
hallmarks 
of 
discrimination. 
The 
Daily article gave them the 
privilege of presenting his open 
mocking of gender identity as 
“debating whether gender is a 
social or biological identity” and 
generally commented more on 
how conservative students feel 
than about how these beliefs 
oppress others. The presence 
of the police at the event shows 
how dedicated the state is 
to protecting them, not only 
against violence but also against 
facing any contrary opinions at 
the event. Actual discrimination 
is 
more 
than 
just 
having 
someone disagree with you. 
If white conservatives (or any 
white people, for that matter) 
had to face any degree of the 
constant trauma people of color 
face on a daily basis from the 
institutions of white supremacy, 
I’m not convinced they would 
survive.

White fragility is a huge 
roadblock in the fight against 
racism. Many white liberal 
students here would probably 
be surprised by how many 
people 
attended 
Crowder’s 
event, seeing the University 
as a liberal and diverse place. 
Students of color know this 
is a lie, and have experienced 
all of the day-to-day traumas 
stemming 
from 
interactions 
with white people, which is 
why Crowder’s popularity is 
unsurprising to me. I doubt 
very many of the people in that 
auditorium would identify as 
racists. Most would probably 
react 
very 
defensively 
to 
the accusation, and this is 
counterproductive to the goal 
of getting someone to actually 
critically evaluate themselves. 
Crowder 
and 
others 
like 
him railing against “identity 
politics” fail to realize that 
whiteness is also an identity, 
and it has been the dominant 
political force over the entire 
history of our country. They 
profess feeling marginalized 
on college campuses for their 
political 
beliefs, 
but 
when 
your beliefs include spreading 
hostility 
against 
actually 
marginalized 
groups, 
like 
women, people of color and 
the LGBTQ community, then 
you can expect repudiation. 
A tolerant society must be 
intolerant of intolerance.

conservatives aren’t discriminated against 
No,

Given the history 
of white violence 
against racial 
minorities in this 
country... I had 
every reason to be 
on my guard

What were the first meeting 
notes like for East Wind, the 
first space for Asian/Pacific 
Islander 
Americans 
at 
the 
University of Michigan back in 
the ’70s?
What were leaders of color 
on campus in the late ’90s 
debating when they occupied 
the Michigan Union for 38 days 
straight? 
What 
were 
the 
reactions 
of 
Asian-American 
student 
organizations during the 2016 
election?
These 
are 
questions 
that 
explore the history of Asians 
and Asian Americans on this 
campus, and the best way we 
can answer them for future 
students and activists is saving 
our important work through 
archiving.
There is unfortunately not 
a lot about Asian-American 
organizing and action in the 
Bentley Historical Library. But 
the United Asian American 
Organizations and the Bentley 
want to change this!
We 
are 
gathering 
vital 
flyers, meeting notes, videos, 
Google 
Documents, 
events, 
petitions, projects and so much 
more to send to the library for 
archiving, so the legacies of 

our organizations and their 
progress is documented and, 
hopefully, recognized. 
But we need your help! If 
you 
have 
anything 
related 
to UAAO and A/PIA student 
organizations, we would be 
incredibly happy to see it. Even 
if it’s something you don’t think 

is a big deal, it might still be a 
valuable piece of information 
that stands for something in our 
point of time — so send those 
Canva posters!
We aim to be inclusive and 
thorough. We want to make sure 
we are properly representing 
the A/PIA community.

No one ever returns from

We always leave a part of

a bookend to their yesterday.
Here lies the flesh,
its youth pulled taut,
and here is the tongue which 
conquers it.
In my dreams, I am
a gentle noise
rolling through the 
countryside,
catching stories on my limbs.
I am my mother’s child
until the sound of a foreign 
boy

takes down an entire village.
A spark of lust
or maybe just curiosity
gone wrong.
The white of the flames so 
perfect
I can almost rewrite my 
family’s past.
His heat begins to
dissolve the tension in my 
chest,
erase the color

so I put out his light
before it can claim me, too.
After all,
what good is a body
that is no longer a home?

O

n Tuesday, e-cigarette 
maker Juul announced 
it would remove their 
fruit-flavored products from store 
shelves, caving into pressure 
from the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration. A week earlier, 
Florida voted to ban indoor 
vaping through, of all things, a 
constitutional amendment that 
also banned offshore drilling. 
Needless to say, this November 
has been a rough month for Juul 
and other e-cig companies. While 
this is by no means a death blow, 
it is a sign that the days of the 
unregulated e-cig industry are 
over. Good riddance.
While 
the 
Trump 
administration is widely, and 
rightfully, seen as dysfunctional, 
the FDA under Trump-appointed 
Scott 
Gottlieb, 
commissioner 
of food and drugs, is coming 
down hard on tobacco and 
e-cig makers. In addition to 
giving e-cig manufacturers an 
ultimatum to pull fruit-flavored 
products off the market, Gottlieb 
is 
moving 
to 
ban 
menthol 
cigarettes, which were exempted 
from the immediate ban on 
flavored cigarettes under the 
Family Smoking Prevention and 
Tobacco Control Act. Gottlieb 
has even proposed using the 
FDA’s regulatory power to force 
tobacco companies to reduce 
nicotine in cigarettes.
All of these regulatory actions 
are focused on combating one 
public health problem: adolescent 
smoking. 
According 
to 
the 
findings, the number of U.S. high 
school students who reported 
being current e-cigarette users 
increased 78 percent between 
2017 and 2018 to 3.05 million (or 
20.8 percent). Numbers among 
middle 
school 
students 
rose 
48 percent to 570,000 (or 4.9 
percent). I think we call too many 
things “epidemics” these days, 
but if youth e-cig use does not cut 
it as an epidemic, what does?
Many people will take issue 

with the FDA’s actions against 
e-cigs, 
but 
any 
action 
that 
increases social good is bound to 
have detractors. Let us inspect 
the arguments presented by the 
pro-vape lobby.
Perhaps the biggest pro-vape 
argument is that e-cigs are safer 
than traditional cigarettes and 
we should therefore count our 
blessings that people prefer a 
Juul over a Camel] Cigarettes 
and tobacco kill half the people 
that use them and its seems e-cigs 
are indeed a safer option because 
they don’t involve the combustion 
of plant matter. This smoke is 
what creates the cancer-causing 
chemicals that make smoking so 
dangerous.
However, 
e-cigs 
are 
not 
harmless. It is important to 
note the FDA is not moving 
against all e-cigs, only flavored 
ones. Currently, e-cig flavoring 
ingredients 
are 
unregulated. 
That should concern everyone. 
A 
Harvard 
University 
study 
found 39 of 51 e-cig flavors 
tested contain diacetyl. What 
is diacetyl? It is an organic 
compound that when vaporized 
and inhaled can cause a serious 
lung disease called bronchiolitis 
obliterans. 
The 
disease 
is 
nicknamed “Popcorn Lung” after 
it was discovered in workers at a 
microwave popcorn factory who 
were exposed to—you guessed 
it—diacetyl. While microwave 
popcorn manufacturers removed 
diacetyl from their products in 
2007, e-cig users and those who 
inhale the secondhand smoke are 
being exposed to this potentially 
dangerous chemical regularly. 
E-cig makers are not required 
to list the ingredients of their 
flavors, so your favorite vapor 
flavor may very well contain 
diacetyl or other potentially 
hazardous chemicals. Regardless 
of how you feel about e-cigs, 
I hope we can all agree that 
smokers should know exactly 
what they are inhaling.

Gottlieb and the FDA are not 
coming for flavored e-cigs and 
menthol cigarettes because of 
chemicals, but instead because 
flavored 
products 
are 
more 
attractive to young people. Even 
if there was no malicious intent, 
e-cig makers who market flavors 
such as mango and Skittles are 
basically waving a big flag to 
young people saying “come and 
try me, I am fun and flavorful.” 
Imagine 
if 
Skittles-flavored 
oxycodone 
hit 
the 
market. 
Would you approve? If you think 
I am over-exaggerating, just 
remember 
nicotine 
addiction 
kills 7 million people globally 
every year. Yes, those deaths 
are 
not 
caused 
by 
nicotine 
directly, but 30.7 percent of teen 
e-cig 
users 
become 
smokers 
(includeing the use of cigarettes, 
cigars and hookahs) compared to 
only 8.1 percent in teens who do 
not vape. Because 90 percent of 
adult smokers start by the age of 
18, you can see why that vape-to-
tobacco statistic is striking.
E-cig 
companies 
love 
to 
advertise their products as a way 
for people to get off of tobacco. 
If Juul and other companies 
truly 
believe 
their 
products 
can help people quit, then they 
should submit their products 
to the rigorous FDA approval 
process that all medical devices 
go through. But these companies 
will not do that. Why? Because 
their objective is to make money, 
and hooking adolescents, with 
their developing brains, on either 
nicotine or marijuana is a great 
way to make customers keep 
coming back. Removing flavored 
e-cigs from the market will make 
adolescents less likely to start 
the habit because tobacco flavor 
(which would not be banned) is 
not nearly as appealing.
Good riddance to flavored 
e-cigarettes. Good riddance to 
the Juul.

A

s a young girl, she was first 
immersed in the world of 
politics as the daughter of 
the mayor of Baltimore, Thomas 
D’Alesandro. In the 
1970s, 
she 
began 
working on California 
Gov. 
Jerry 
Brown’s 
presidential campaign 
and went on to become 
the 
chair 
for 
the 
California Democratic 
Party. 
After 
being 
persuaded 
to 
start 
her 
own 
campaign, 
she was sworn in as 
a congresswoman in 
1987 and rose quickly through the 
ranks of the Democratic Party. 
After the 2006 elections, Nancy 
Pelosi became the first female 
speaker of the House.
Though she has been a barrier 
breaker and continues to be one 
of the most powerful people — 
and women — in Washington, 
many candidates ran on an anti-
Pelosi platform in this year’s 
midterms. There are currently 11 
Democratic incumbents and 47 
former candidates firmly vowing 
to vote against Pelosi to be the 
Speaker of the House in January 
when the new congress is sworn 
in. This coalition of congressional 
elects and current incumbents 
seldom raises any substantive 
policy differences with Pelosi. 
Even before 2018, the name 
Nancy Pelosi has been used by 
many Republicans as shorthand 
for 
everything 
wrong 
with 
Washington, a signal to ramp 
up their base against “coastal-
elite liberals.” Their argument 
against Pelosi is because many 
Republicans have succeeded in 
making her a target, a new, less 
easily demonized leader would 
be better for the party, as if 
Republicans won’t gladly vilify 
anyone up for the job before she 
or he is even sworn in. 
Yet, 
the 
House 
of 
Representatives will be controlled 
once again by the Democrats come 
January after Democrats gained 
37 seats to take at least a 232 to 
198 majority as of publication 
time with 5 seats currently 
undecided. 
Meanwhile, 
the 
Republicans maintained control 
of the Senate by flipping they 
have flipped four seats as of now. 
Though this blue wave could yield 
as many as 40 seats, it has already 
resulted in the most Democratic 

gains since Watergate. These 
wins are absolutely a testament 
to the fantastic and inspiring 
candidates, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
amazing work done 
by progressive groups 
like 
Emily’s 
List, 
Run for Something, 
Moms 
Demand 
Action, 
Indivisible, 
etc. However, credit 
must also be given 
to 
Pelosi 
and 
her 
plan to elect these 
exciting 
candidates: 
avoid responding to 
every terrible thing 
President Donald Trump says 
or does and be disciplined about 
the 
Democratic 
message 
on 
health care. With the benefit of 
hindsight, it is almost certain that 
the focus on health care delivered 
many districts, especially those 
that flipped from red to blue, to 
the Democrats.
Though there were Democratic 
losses in the Senate and great 
strides made in the House, there 
is only one Democratic leader 
being asked to step down, and 
it’s not Chuck Schumer, the New 
York senator and Senate minority 
leader. Both Pelosi and Schumer 
have faced a plethora of criticism, 
including calls for newer, younger 
leadership, but it comes with 
the job. Still, there is something 
more visceral about the repeated 
denunciations of Pelosi rather 
than Schumer, despite the fact 
that they share similar identity 
demographics and policy stances. 
So what gives? Well, there is 
only one significant difference 
between the two: gender.
While some might roll their 
eyes at attributing the hostility 
aimed at Pelosi to sexism, it is 
justified simply because it holds 
a similar thread to the hostility 
aimed at Hillary Clinton during 
the 2016 presidential campaign. 
In her book “What Happened”, 
Clinton describes the fact that 
her approval rating plummeted 
when she was seen as advocating 
for herself (like running for 
president, 
for 
example), 
but 
soared when she was working in 
the service of others, particularly 
men (serving as President Barack 
Obama’s secretary of state, for 
example). It seems as though the 
same phenomenon is true for 
Pelosi, and if it’s true for them 
— two white, privileged women 

— it might as well be true for all 
women. Simply put, America does 
not like female leaders.
Despite the politicking against 
her, it is almost guaranteed that 
current Speaker Paul Ryan will 
have to pass the gavel to Pelosi 
as the new speaker of the House. 
And for good reason. Pelosi is 
good at her job. Recently, former 
Obama adviser David Axelrod, 
in conversation with journalist 
Gloria Borger on his CNN podcast 
The Axe Files, said the Affordable 
Care Act would not have passed 
had it not been for Pelosi. Not 
only did Pelosi craft the health 
care 
message 
for 
Democrats 
to run on in 2018, she made 
this policy platform possible 
years earlier during the Obama 
administration. Moreover, both 
agreed she is one of the most 
effective and experienced party 
leaders in recent memory.
Pelosi will be just fine. She 
is likely to be voted in as the 
next speaker of the House, 
but she exemplifies a broader 
American problem. In order to 
prepare for 2020, Americans 
— especially Democrats— need 
to begin to grapple with the 
extra harassment and gendered-
criticisms women face when 
they become leaders. All of the 
inspiring women who won in the 
midterms and are now headed 
to Washington can certainly 
aid the country in imagining 
woman leadership looks like. 
Still, there are likely to be several 
Democratic 
women 
running 
for president in 2020: Kamala 
Harris, 
Kirsten 
Gillibrand, 
Elizabeth Warren and others 
are 
contemplating 
bids. 
If 
Democrats want to win, these 
women just might be their best 
bet. Democrats should not kick 
off the lead up to 2020 by treating 
Pelosi with the same gendered-
loathing directed at Clinton in 
2016, especially because the 
hostility 
toward 
Pelosi 
was 
drummed up by Republicans 
as a political weapon to win 
back the House. Instead, they 
need to consider how this sexist 
contempt will ultimately hurt 
their candidates, and therefore, 
any hope they have of winning 
the White House in 2020.

espite the fervor with 
which I despise the manic 
pixie dream girl archetype, 
I have always found the film “(500) 
Days of Summer” to be undeniably 
charming. To the uninitiated, it is 
the indie tale of Summer played 
by Zooey Deschanel, who doesn’t 
believe in love, and Tom, played by 
Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who is an 
unapologetic romantic, and their 
relationship spanning a year and a 
half. They have their ups and downs 
as Tom slowly falls in love and 
Summer slowly does not.
In a scene toward the end of 
the film (after they have broken 
up), they run into one another and 
Summer invites Tom to a party at her 
apartment. Tom is thrilled: This is 
his chance to win her back. The night 
of the party, the screen splits in two, 
one side showing Tom’s expectations 
for the night, the other showing 
reality. Tom’s expectations split with 
what the audience perceives as he is 
greeted at the door with a kiss, and 
they spend the night flirting, talking 
and laughing. The spark is reignited, 
and Tom gets the girl. It is the 
expected and highly satisfying rom-
com ending.
On the other side of the screen, 
however, Tom arrives to a cordial but 
somewhat awkward greeting from 
Summer. They don’t talk one-on-one 
at all, and at the end of the evening 
Tom sees Summer showing off her 
engagement ring to another party 
goer. Ouch.
When I was in high school, I had 
spectacular fantasies that played 
out in my head. I imbued them with 
intricate detail, making them as 
plausible as I could, as if the more 
particular they were the more likely 
I could will them into being. These 
fantasies 
became 
expectations 
that led to a general and persistent 
disappointment in my reality. I had a 
lot of feelings from ages 12 to 17, as I 
think most people do—for example I 
wrote one day (likely in response to 
one of those expectations failing to 
come to fruition), “I’m feeling a lot 

of things, but most prominent is an 
eagerness to have one of my feelings 
validated by an actual event.”
I don’t remember what prompted 
me to write this down, but reading 
it now makes me chuckle. I’m a bit 
in awe of my ability to condense the 
entire teenage girl experience into 
one sentence. I watched a lot of movies 
and read a lot of books at 14 and 15. 
Like many girls, I was obsessed with 
romantic dramas, finding in them the 
promise that I, too, could have a grand 
dramatic arc in my life.
I moved through high school 
perpetually comparing my unrealistic 
expectations to my banal reality. 
There are only so many experiences 
the average teen goes through. I went 
to school, had friends, went to movies 
on the weekends, did my homework 
and spent time with my family. I 
probably had a better-than-average 
life and a better-than-average high 
school experience. For someone like 
me, though, who inhaled popular 
culture, there were stark contrasts at 
every turn.
I was only granted access to 
much of the human experience 
through back channels: TV shows, 
movies, novels and second-hand 
stories. I tried to shove my own 
experiences into these molds like an 
ugly stepsister with a too-small glass 
slipper, impatient to have my own 
stories to tell.
My life seemingly had no plot, 
and I felt I was being denied a rite of 
passage. So, I spun my own stories. As 
I fell asleep each night, I scripted my 
life in a way believable enough that 
I would wake up the next morning 
confident that this alternate reality 
could unfold if only this or that fell 
into place.
I imagined the boy I had a crush 
on since sophomore year would 
finally realize he liked me. I imagined 
I would suddenly learn to love 
exercising and get into amazing shape 
so I wouldn’t always feel like the girl 
who might be beautiful if she wasn’t 
a few pounds over the heroine chic 
ideal. I imagined I would be struck 

with a lightning bolt of inspiration 
and finally find the persistence to 
write a novel. I had the dedication 
already written.
I became very good at telling 
myself these stories, and they felt 
more and more real to me. In the 
20 minutes it took me to fall asleep, 
I would have a first kiss with a boy, 
become a published author and run a 
marathon. I was invested in each plot, 
and I followed myself like a character 
in a book. I felt what she felt. I woke up 
in the morning hopeful, then lived the 
same day I had lived the day before. 
And the day before that.
So, I had a lot of feelings in high 
school. The problem was I imagined 
most of them. I craved that swell of 
emotion you feel when something 
spectacular happens to a character 
you have been following for five 
seasons or five hundred pages. I had 
never really felt any of those things 
in real life. I had to create artificial 
placeholders.
Since coming to college, I have 
experienced one or two of the things 
I used to only play out in my head. I 
have had some of the feelings that 
I craved at 14 validated by actual 
events. But when milestones are only 
imagined, it is easy to strip away any 
undesirable fallout. There are no 
fights with imaginary boyfriends, 
and you don’t actually have to sweat 
if you only imagine losing weight. 
Reality is always more complicated 
and a little harder than just the girl 
getting the guy.
Now, I think often of another, 
smaller scene from “(500) Days of 
Summer.” One of Tom’s roommates 
is describing his dream girl in 
comparison to his current girlfriend. 
She would have bigger boobs and 
different hair and be more into sports. 
“But,” he says, “truthfully, Robin’s 
better than the girl of my dreams. She’s 
real.” An imaginary life is perfect, but 
it pales in comparison to the tangible 
messiness we get to live every day.

Expectations versus reality

“T

he sexual orientation 
of my parents has 
had zero effect on the 
content of my character.”
That February night in 2011 was 
particularly cold. In the dark confines 
of my room, I watched as then-19-year-
old Zach Wahls stood before the Iowa 
House of Representatives. Raised by 
two mothers, Wahls spoke out against 
the proposed House Joint Resolution 6, 
which would ban civil unions for same-
sex partners in the state. His heartfelt 
speech unsettled me, as the concept of 
having to defend the legitimacy of his 
own parents seemed so degrading. Yet, 
his conviction and sincerity gave me a 
glimpse of hope for the future.
Nonetheless, his words were still 
too premature for the chamber, as 
it moved to pass the committee by a 
majority vote.
I turned off my computer, and the 
dimming of the screen was met by a 
frigid darkness.
Coming to understand my sexuality 
at the start of this decade was a 
particularly tumultuous circumstance. 
Relative to years past, great progress 
for the LGBT community had been 
made. Yet, like with many other 
struggles, as small strides toward 
justice commence, strong currents of 
pushback erupt.
As I began to develop what being 
gay meant to me, our nation began to 
develop what being gay meant for it. I 
knew each step toward acceptance of 
myself also came with an inherent loss: 
an inability to marry the person I loved, 
the inability to serve our country’s 
military and invitation to a newfound 

scrutiny.
I watched as national leaders 
warned 
of 
the 
dangers 
of 
“homosexuals,” 
expressing 
toxic 
rhetoric: “They are intolerant. They 
are hateful. They are vile …and are 
engaged...in an agenda that will destroy 
them and our nation.” I remember 
getting onto the school bus to hear 
the news that North Carolina voters 
passed Amendment One, banning 
same-sex marriage in the state. Despite 
my initial hurt, these events did not 
constantly reverberate in my thoughts. 
But one thing I could not shake out 
of my mind were the words of Zach 
Wahls, specifically, “the content of 
(his) character.” This phrase, albeit 
simple, evoked the sentiment of civil 
rights activists also dedicated to a more 
perfect union. Maybe I saw myself in 
him – I saw someone I could maybe 
become one day.
Years have passed since those nights 
alone in my room, and much progress 
has come along with it. We have seen 
the enshrinement of marriage equality 
in our laws, the repeal of Don’t Ask 
Don’t Tell and a surge in public support 
for LGBTQ rights.
Yet, during the midterm election on 
Nov. 6 midterm election, something 
felt different.
Finally, this abundant societal 
change became reflected in our 
nation’s representatives. In Colorado, 
we saw the election of Jared Polis, the 
nation’s first openly gay governor. In 
New Hampshire, two transgender 
women, Gerri Cannon and Lisa 
Bunker, won seats in the state House 
of Representatives. Sharice Davids, 

an openly gay candidate in Kansas, 
joined Debra Haaland of New Mexico 
as the first two Native American 
women elected to Congress. Voters 
in Massachusetts handily defeated a 
proposal to repeal transgender rights 
and protections. After almost a week 
delay, the state of Arizona will elect 
the nation’s first openly bisexual U.S. 
Senator. At the local, state and national 
level, a wave of LGBTQ candidates was 
voted into office.
There was one person also elected 
on Nov. 6 who, though not gay himself, 
allowed me to see just how far I—and 
this nation—have come. Zach Wahls, 
the once 19-year-old student who 
spoke in defense of his parents, was 
elected to the Iowa state Senate. In 
2011, the people who he stood before 
may not have been ready, but finally, 
seven years later, the people of Iowa 
were.
So on a Tuesday evening seven 
years later, I again found myself in front 
of a screen, seeing the same man whose 
words I used to watch night after night 
in secrecy – and resignation. Except 
this time, that feeling of longing and 
sadness was replaced with hope. This 
time, the cold confines of my childhood 
bedroom were replaced with the 
comfort of friends, tightly packed onto 
a worn living room couch. Each one of 
our faces was marked with a cautiously 
optimistic glimpse of hope. And as each 
one of us stared at the screen, we were 
beginning to see people that looked just 
like us staring back.

There’s 
almost 
nothing 

fantastic in this sequel to 2016’s 
“Fantastic Beasts and Where to 
Find Them.” The magic that once 
permeated every frame and page 
of Harry Potter’s story has all 

but evaporated. All that remains 
are one-note characters and an 
extremely convoluted series of 
subplots that never quite come 
together. Directed once again by 
David Yates (“Harry Potter and the 
Deathly Hallows”), who has now 
helmed six of the 10 films in the 
Potterverse, the movie feels like a 
final confirmation of what many 
already knew: It’s time for him to 
move on. J.K. Rowling herself is 
again the sole credited screenwriter 
here, leaving much to be desired. 
The cast is sprawling and massive, 
but only Eddie Redmayne (“The 
Theory of Everything”), Johnny 
Depp (“Pirates of the Caribbean”) 
and Jude Law (“The Young 

Pope”) — who portrays a younger 
version of legendary wizard Albus 
Dumbledore — register in any kind 
of way.

The story begins sometime after 

the first film, following magical 
zoologist 
Newt 
Scamander 

(Redmayne) as he attempts to track 
down Credence, the powerful and 
dangerous wizard who seemingly 
perished in the last movie but is 
back here and is once again the 
MacGuffin that drives almost 
the entirety of the plot. All of the 
characters from the first movie are 
back, along with a whole host of 
new characters who only serve to 
derail the action and distract from 
the main story. None of these new 
characters are given nearly enough 
to do to justify their existence. 
Newt’s brother is introduced and 
proceeds to do almost nothing in 
the rest of the film. An emotional 
moment surrounding him falls 
completely flat at the end as a result 
of how little build-up he gets. Other 
new additions include the human 
version of Nagini (who will one 
day become one of Voldemort’s 
Horcruxes), Leta Lestrange (Zoe 
Kravitz, “Big Little Lies”) — a 
distant relative of the villainous 
Bellatrix Lestrange — and a whole 
cadre of aurors and wizards who 
work for Grindelwald, none of 
whom are distinguishable from 
each other. 

The appearance of Nagini in this 

movie is the perfect small-scale 
example of the problems of the 
“Fantastic Beasts” series at large. 
Seemingly included only to remind 

Harry Potter fans of those earlier 
and superior films, she serves no 
purpose in this movie and is given 
maybe five lines. If she does have 
a purpose in the overall narrative, 
it won’t be clear until some other 
movie down the line. That’s how 
most of the things in “Crimes of 
Grindelwald” feel. Appearances of 
Minerva McGonagall and Nicholas 
Flamel act as wholly unnecessary 
cameos and at this point, it’s 
not clear how Newt himself is 
possibly going to stay relevant to 
the proceedings, as the coming 
war between Dumbledore and 
Grindelwald begins to take center 
stage. Basically, every character 
other than those two titanic 
wizards could be removed from the 
story and nothing of consequence 
would change at all. Rowling 
steeps her story in exposition, 
giving characters who only appear 
in this film, don’t make it to the end, 
and will probably never be seen 
again long flashbacks explaining 
their history and motivations. 
While that kind of thing can work 
in a 700-page novel, on the screen, 
it comes across as unfocused and 
disjointed. One sequence in the 
third act is literally two different 
five-minute 
monologues 
going 

into the family tree of a character 
whose origins are later revealed to 
be entirely different to what was 
previously believed. This entire 
section of the film is so confusing 
that even the most diehard of 
Potter fans may find themselves 
hopelessly lost. A final twist at the 
end is so utterly baffling that it 

will leave viewers 
wondering if J.K. 
Rowling has truly 
lost her mind. 

There 
are 
a 

few bright spots. 
Jude Law shines 
as 
Dumbledore, 

and despite all of 
the 
controversy 

surrounding 
his 

casting 
in 
this 

film, on a strictly 
performance 
level, this has to 
be Johnny Depp’s 
best performance 
in 
years. 
Were 

the film to have 
focused 
entirely 

on the relationship 
between 
Dumbledore 
and 

Grindelwald 
it 

might have come 
closer to touching 
that Harry Potter 
magic. With three 
more 
“Beasts” 

movies 
in 
the 

pipeline, it’s hard to 
imagine how this 
story can possibly 
stay 
interesting 

for six more hours. 
In this film, the 
plot seems to be 
running on fumes 
and this only part 
two of five. To see 
the once perfect 
film 
franchise 

and do-no-wrong 
author fall so far 
may be hard for 
some 
fans, 
but 

general audiences 
have been down 
this road before. 
Prequels, as any 
fan of “Star Wars” 
or “Lord of the 
Rings” will tell you, 
just never quite 
seem to work out 
the way you want 
them to.

‘Crimes of Grindelwald’ is 
a crime against audiences

FILM REVIEW

“Fantastic 
Beats: The 
Crimes of 

Grindelwald”

Warner Bros. 

Pictures 

Quality 16, Rave 

Cinemas

Sixty miles across the coast 

of Africa lie the Canary Islands, 
collectively 
an 
autonomous 

community of Spain built by the 
commerce flowing through it 
onward to the New World. Its 
influence on the music of Pablo 
Díaz-Reixa (better known as El 
Guincho) is palpable, leading to 
some of the most unique, daring 
pop music of recent years.

El Guincho, a resident of Las 

Palmas (the largest city of the 
island Gran Canaria), describes 
his music as “space-age exotica,” 
and whatever that means, it 
makes a lot of sense. Starting with 
Alegranza! and Pop Negro in 2010, 
he has released music centered on 
a diverse set of samples and off-
kilter rhythms. The highlights of 
the two albums are loud, brash 
and 
eclectic, 
showcasing 
El 

Guincho’s wide knowledge of the 
world’s music combined with an 
intuitive sense for good pop.

El Guincho’s samples range 

from Brazil to Ghana, and like 
the masters of the art in the hip-
hop and electronic realm, he is 
extremely skilled at making his 
chops and loops organic and 
lively. He does certainly have a 

penchant for specific types of 
samples, be it West African high 
life or Brazilian Tropicalia, but it 
lends a cohesive atmosphere to all 
of his work.

Arguably his most popular 

song, “Bombay” is the best 
example of his pop sensibilities 
mixed with his experimental 

streak. A hypnotic steel drum 
pattern 
anchors 
the 
track, 

with El Guincho’s thin vocals 
(Spanish is particularly perfect 
for this kind of music) barely 
registering 
in 
the 
mix 
and 

blending in with the constant, 
busy 
instrumentation. 
The 

track’s memorable music video 

(disclaimer: It is rather explicit) 
is a wonderful companion to the 
track and is a perfect translation 
of El Guincho’s musical style into 
video.

Most of his tracks put rhythm at 

the forefront, as the main source 
of activity and variation rather 
than the melodies. Steel drums 
are a common feature, as well as 
percussion used commonly in 
South American and African folk.

El 
Guincho’s 
tendency 
to 

clutter and layer to the extreme 
aren’t always successful, and 
he can get slightly too carried 
away, 
detracting 
from 
the 

groove he gets into himself over 
the course of the first half of a 
track. Nonetheless, the hits that 
accompany the misses more 
than make up for them. His 
work borrows from Panda Bear 
and The Avalanches but is more 
forceful and buoyant, rather than 
the often hazy, dreamlike quality 
of the former.

El Guincho’s music is restless 

and colorful in a manner which 
pop 
music 
rarely 
operates 

in. 
While 
making 
music 

electronically, he infuses a sense 
of messiness and vibrancy that 
enhances the diverse set of 
sources he works with, resulting 
in music with a childlike sense of 
wonder.

It is no secret that queer 

women still lack normalized 
representation in the media, but 
we already knew that. And with 
more and more television shows 
mistaking 
representation 
for 

exploitation, it is refreshing to 
sit down and watch a television 
program in which a woman 
chooses to experiment sexually 
without the specter of the male 
gaze looming over its inclusion.

“Sally4Ever” 
is 
a 
British-

American comedy created and 
written by Julia Davis (“Electric 
Dreams”), taking its place among 
“Chewing Gum” and “Crazyhead” 
in the new renaissance of female-
helmed British comedies. The 
series 
follows 
protagonist 

Sally 
(Catherine 
Shepherd, 

“Paddington 2”), as she struggles 
to come to terms with the 
boredom of her existence. This 
boredom manifests itself through 
the many mundane aspects of 
her everyday life: her pointless 
job, her dull sex life and her 
seeming lack of friends. With her 
boyfriend David’s (Julian Barratt, 
“Flowers”) recent proposal of 
marriage, Sally’s life seems to 
be headed towards a permanent 
flatline. That is, until she locks 
eyes with a stranger named 
Emma (Davis) on the tube, and 
begins to question what she truly 
wants in life.

Where “Sally4Ever” shines is 

in its realistic exploration of this 
boredom. Showing that someone 
is unhappy with pretty much 
every aspect of their existence 
can be a tough feat — you must 
show that the person has a 
justifiable reason to be bored, yet 
avoid making their lives look like 
a farcical mockery of everyday 
life. Julia Davis’s writing nailed 
this niche to a T. The dialogue 
that took place between Sally 
and her co-workers and between 
Sally and her husband was so 
realistically awkward and passive 
aggressive that it was hard not to 
feel second-hand discomfort.

In addition to the realism that 

highlighted the cause of Sally’s 
crisis, the authenticity of her 
actions while in the midst of her 
break also felt sensible. Rather 
than writing Sally as going off the 
rails and abruptly taking on a new 
persona once she is momentarily 
tempted by Emma, she stays true 
to form. Sally challenges herself 
to sneak out to the rave that Emma 
is performing at, but attends 
dressed like a middle schooler. 
Some of the best comedy of the 
pilot episode was derived from 
this dance between Sally’s clear 
internal wanting to be dangerous 
and her subpar execution.

However, the downside of a 

show that is so realistically boring 
is that sometimes there are points 
where it just seems boring. Every 
secondary 
character 
retained 

more entertainment value than 
Sally. 
Even 
the 
supposedly 

unlikable characters, like her 
co-workers, 
were 
engaging 

enough to make me sit up during 
their scenes. I could not say the 
same for Sally. Unlike other 
“normal person bored with drab 
life” comedies, the character of 
Sally did not make me believe 
that she deserved better than 
what she already has. The most 
intriguing character on the show 

proved to be Emma, not simply 
because she is a hilariously 
untalented 
multi-hyphenate 

(actor, singer, dancer, artist), 
but also because of the clear 
manipulation she uses to lure in 

Sally that leaves the audiences 
wondering if she actually gives 
two shits about Sally or, if she is 
just using the poor girl as a form 
of entertainment.

“Sally4Ever” clearly has a lot 

of ground to cover; I am excited 
to see where the show will take 
its audience over the course of its 
eight-episode order. Hopefully, 
on a show with such an exciting 
and daring premise, the character 
at the center will be able to 
experience more development 
that elevates her from solely 
being defined by her sadness and 
boredom into a character who 
has multiple facets to her being.

ALBUM REVIEW

After almost three years, the 

British folk band Mumford and 
Sons steps back into the spotlight 
with their new album Delta. 
However, after eagerly awaiting 
the band’s return since their 
2015 release Wilder Mind, which 
featured a stronger pop-vibe to 
the band’s trademark folk, Delta 
is lackluster and disappointing. 
Mumford and Sons seem to 
be in the midst of an identity 
crisis, almost completely losing 

touch with the folksy, grassroots 
authenticity 
of 
their 
earlier 

albums, which included hits 
like “I Will Wait,” “The Cave” 
and “Little Lion Man.” The 
band’s more recent releases have 
taken baby-steps away from the 
traditional folk instrumentation 
— banjo, guitar, drums and 
horns — to add a modern touch 
with busier instrumentation and 
an ebb-and-flow in the surreal 
ambiance of the music. Delta 
takes it a step too far, abandoning 
almost all of Mumford and 
Sons 
unique 
trademarks 
— 

imaginative, honest, rustic lyrics 
and a home-made, native folk 
feel — in danger of becoming yet 
another, unoriginal alternative-
rock band threatened by looming 
obscurity.

The album consists of 14 

songs, opening with mediocre 
“42,” which comes off as loud, 
busy and underwhelming. The 
harmonizing of the vocals is 
vaguely reminiscent of gospel and 
hymnal songs which is further 
emphasized in the lyrics, “We 
wanna see a sign / Give us some 
guiding light.” However, while 
the spiritual undertones and 
harmonies recall the antiquity 
of more traditional music, the 
song comes off as passing, but 
ultimately 
forgettable. 
After 

name-dropping the song in “42,” 
the album continues on with 
“Guiding Light.” “Guiding Light” 
is by no means a bad song, and 
follows familiar Mumford and 
Sons themes of heartbreak and 
emotional confessions of love. 
However, the song builds into 
a wave of sound that drowns 
out some good lyrics and the 
comforting country twang of 
the vocals. “Beloved” tries to 

recover some ground, bringing 
in a shadow of the familiar folk 
tunes to the echoing techno-
style sounds which dominate the 
album. “Darkness Visible” is one 
of the few songs worth listening 
to, if only because it’s so very 
strange. The song is dramatic, 
dark and ominous, and feels 
more suitable for the surreal 
dream-sequences of the movie 
“Inception” than a folk-alt rock 
band. On the other hand, “October 
Skies” is the most faithful to what 
might be considered Mumford 
and Sons original style (which 
they seem all too eager to throw 
out the window), and contains 
some surprisingly great lyrics for 
such an underwhelming album: 
“These postcard memories / 
evade my eyes / In the valley I’m 
free / but in the hills I soar.”

The 
stylistic 
shift 
from 

Mumford and Sons’s original 
(and beloved) Sigh No More 
(2009) and Babel (2012), to Wilder 
Mind (2015) and finally Delta 
(2018) has been a gradual move 
away from their folk to a more 
confident commitment to the 
alternative-rock genre. Yet, in 
this transition the band seems 
to lose touch with what makes 
them unique. Their earlier music 
had a strong down-to-earth vibe, 
and songs like “I Will Wait” and 
“Little Lion Man” captured a 
sense of sincerity, which made 
the band’s music so poignant. 
They captured the pride, dignity 
and antiquity of the British folk 
and bluegrass music, and even 
the name “Mumford and Sons” 
is an obvious play off of the 
traditional business and company 
names of the 20th century. This 
attempted reinvention to gain 
a 
stronger, 
more 
prominent 

presence in the modern alt rock 
genre clashes with the folksy, old-
fashioned vibe that the band’s 
image caters to. It’s almost as 
if the band is making a painful 
effort to be more appealing in 
the modern market by sacrificing 
what may be deemed too “old-
fashioned” for a global audience 
dominated by the loud, dramatic 
thunderstorms of sound we know 
as pop and rock. But whether it’s 
from a lack of originality, or the 
contrast between Mumford and 
Sons’s image with the starkly 
different Delta, something feels 
missing in this latest album. 
It’s not that any of the album 
is “bad” (although “Darkness 
Visible” toes the line), but the 
familiar twang of the banjo and 
the heavier folk influence is 
sorely missed in Delta. Change 
and artistic development is good 
and important, but Mumford and 
Sons may be taking a step in the 

wrong direction.

In the end, casual listeners 

will enjoy Mumford and Sons 
latest album as a new addition to 
a probably overplayed alt rock-
folk playlist. However, more 
dedicated fans, especially those 
who regularly foray into classic 
country and more traditional, 

pure folk will be disappointed by 
this album. Part of what makes 
folk and alternative bands great 
is their unashamed, undaunted 
pride in their acknowledgment 
of antiquity and of their roots — 
Mumford and Sons turn away 
from their beginning, and it feels 
almost like a personal rejection 
at times. They seemingly bow to 
the pressure of business, industry 
and the tastes of uniform the 
majority, rather than standing by 
their roots. 

Mumford and Sons’ ‘Delta’ 
falls flat, away from folk

“Boy Erased” follows the story 

of Jared Eamons (Lucas Hedges, 
“Lady Bird”), the son of a Baptist 
preacher who, upon coming out 
to his family, must join a gay 
conversion therapy program or 
risk ostracism from everyone he 

knows. The film was adapted from 
Garrard Conley’s memoir of the 
same name and directed by Joel 
Edgerton (“The Gift”), who plays 
a supporting role himself. While 
Edgerton approaches the heavy 
subject material with appropriate 
weight and nuance, the film suffers 
from its excessively narrow focus 
on events rather than characters. 

The movie’s first hour is nearly 

flawless. 
Edgerton’s 
ability 
to 

immerse viewers in the gravity 
of Jared’s experiences without 
breathless exposition is remarkable. 
The audience gets a clear sense of 
the pressure he is facing without an 
explicit understanding of the reason 
he is there. Hedges’s performance 
is suffused with a quiet, uneasy 
intensity 
that 
unleashes 
itself 

rarely but memorably throughout 
the movie. He effortlessly conveys 
through the timidness of his gait and 
the restraint of his smile that there 
is something deeply uncomfortable 
about the program. That queasiness 
is bitingly palpable and sustains for 
most of the runtime. 

Other performances in the 

film, while generally strong, are 
somewhat 
underused. 
Nicole 

Kidman (“Big Little Lies”) plays 
Jared’s mother Nancy, and her 
genuine sympathy for him lends the 
film a much-needed source of levity. 
Russell Crowe (“The Nice Guys”), 
who plays Jared’s father, skillfully 
shows his character’s internal 
conflict in accepting his son.

Edgerton’s control over the 

visual palette of the therapy center 
is masterful. He recalls Kubrick’s 
“Full Metal Jacket” in the way 
that that slow tracking shots across 
rows of boys turn individuals 
into monotonous uniforms. This 
comparison, whether intentional 
or not, is striking because the 
conversion program descends into 
gradual brutality as the film goes 
on. 

The film’s most distracting flaw 

is the way it uses minor characters, 
mostly the other participants in 
the program, as mere vehicles 
to 
develop 
and 
alter 
Jared’s 

perspective. They rarely feel like 
actual people, only lines of dialogue 
that push the narrative forward. 
This is a painful misstep for a movie 
whose emotional impact rests 
on the devastation of conversion 
therapy. The connection we form 
to these minor characters feels 
so forced and artificial that it has 
the tendency to take one out of an 
otherwise engrossing experience. 

Another issue of “Boy Erased” 

is that Edgerton frequently loses 
his sense of subtlety. One of Jared’s 
flashbacks reveals his first few 
months at college and involves one 
of the film’s most intense, haunting 
moments. The duration that this 
moment holds turns from excessive 
to insensitive because Edgerton’s 
camera stays stubbornly fixed in 
place where it could have — and 
should have — cut away. The film’s 

dramatic climax also lacks nuance, 
seeming to arrive out of thin air 
and neatly wrapping the central 
conflict in a box. We are left with 
the story that approximates a 
blunt and sanctimonious catalog of 
tribulations more than a memoir. 
Jared’s agency, while key to crafting 
the film’s ending and real-life 
resolution, is nonexistent until the 
story conjures it into existence. 

In 
a 
word, 
the 
film 
is 

overdramatic. Edgerton doesn’t 
implore us to consider his message. 
He waves it in front of our noses 
until we have no choice but to accept 
it. This is accurately exemplified by 
the movie’s perplexing score by 
Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans 
(“Barry”). While agreeably light 
and mellifluous in more intimate 
moments, the score occasionally 
transforms into a ridiculous ticking 
heartbeat that sounds like a Nine 
Inch Nails song recreated on 
GarageBand and more fitting for a 
B-movie horror flick. 

That being said, “Boy Erased” 

is a story that is overdue and needs 
to be shared. Despite the film’s 
faults, it exposes the lasting harm 
of conversion therapy in a more 
visceral and visual way than has 
been shown before. What could 
have been an intensely moving 
story about an individual facing 
a collective struggle, it lacked the 
nuance of a single boy’s story or the 
depth of a nationwide issue. And yet, 
conversion therapy being depicted 
on a large screen is a notable step 
towards educating viewers about its 
harm. As the film tells us before the

There are many ways to mess up 

a thriller that begins with a slew 
of characters thrown together 
under 
unusual 
circumstances. 

Introduce too many characters 
at once and readers will have no 

way to remember who is who. 
Introduce them in the same way, 
and 
a 
formulaic, 
predictable 

pattern will develop that bores 
readers and make them want to 
find something else to do with 
their time. In her latest novel, 
“Nine Perfect Strangers,” Liane 
Moriarty (the author of the 2014 
bestseller “Big Little Lies”) paces 
the introduction of her characters 
perfectly 
and 
finds 
amusing 

ways to gently remind readers 
who is who and exactly why they 
are important, proving she has 
mastered the art of such a story.

It all starts with a heart 

attack. Masha Dmitrichenko is 

a charismatic, alluring woman 
familiar with the stress and bad 
habits that come along with the 
fast-paced world of business. 
After she undergoes cardiac arrest 
and almost dies, she is inspired 
to change her life by opening a 
wellness resort, which she dubs 
“Tranquillum House.” The novel 
tells the tale of nine individuals 
who sign up for the Tranquillum 
House’s 10-day wellness retreat 
in Australia. The story focuses 
on Frances Welty, an established 
romance writer who is struggling 
to adapt to the changing publishing 
industry and other trials that come 
along with aging. 

Frances is soon joined at the 

resort by a cast of other characters 
all grappling with their own 
problems: a has-been football 
player, a couple struggling to 
salvage their marriage, an insecure 
mother of four abandoned by her 
husband for a younger woman 
and a family trying to repair their 
lives after a suicide tears them 
apart. Each chapter is told from 
the point of view of a rotating 
cast of characters. Through a 
combination of flashbacks and 
present 
day 
events, 
readers 

begin to piece the lives of each 
character together and gain a deep 
understanding of who they are as 
a person. Each person is relatable, 
intriguing 
and 
painstakingly 

human and their stories are woven 
together in a way that makes 
readers hungry to know more 
about them.

Most of the novel is focused on 

the events that take place at the 
Tranquillum House. The guests 
endure fasting, extended periods 
of silence and other lifestyle 
changes promised to transform 
the guests. Moriarty is able to 
make seemingly small interactions 
and 
commonplace 
moments 

entertaining and riveting, as if they 
are not commonplace, but crucial. 
Even as the story goes on and it 
becomes clear the Tranquillum 
House and the ethereal Masha are 
not all they seem to be, the focus 
remains on the humanity of the 
guests. Such a focus allows readers 
to connect with the characters and 
know them on a level that would 
not otherwise be possible.

“Nine 
Perfect 
Strangers” 

is 
a 
well-developed, 
detailed 

novel about recovery and the 
transformative power of human 
connection. It raises questions of 
whether or not a person can truly 
move on from despair and loss, 
or if they even should. It tackles 
issues of body image, material 
possession and mental health. 
More than that, it presents readers 
with realistic and vulnerable 
characters, which makes for an 
intimate and moving story.

In ‘Nine Perfect Strangers,’ 
Moriarty showcases talent

Michigan slips past Indiana, and Ohio State looms

For better or worse, this is it
Y

ou’ll read this sentiment 
several times this week:
The Michigan football 
team will 
play Ohio 
State — its 
biggest rival 
— Saturday, 
with a chance 
to keep its 
dreams alive. 
The Wolver-
ines can exor-
cise their Big 
Ten Cham-
pionship demons, their can’t-
beat-the-Buckeyes demons 
and continue their trek toward 
rising to the College Football 
Playoff. Put another way, they 
control their own destiny.
Those will be tired tropes by 
the time kickoff comes around, 
but that isn’t without good rea-
son.
Michigan is staying mum on 
the topic. The Wolverines have 
avoided any dream-killing loss 
for 10 straight games, doing 
what they must to get to this 
position by beating any and 
every team in their path. And 
they claim they’ll maintain the 
same mindset this week.
“It’s just another game,” said 
junior quarterback Shea Pat-
terson. “We understand the 
tradition and meaning behind 
it, and we’re gonna attack it 
the same way we have the past 
10 or 11 weeks. We know that 
they’re a good ball club, and at 
their place, but we’re just gonna 
prepare.”
The Wolverines have to say 
that, of course. But this isn’t 
another game, for all the rea-
sons listed above. It is a game to 
prove this season has been for 
something.
The last 14 seasons — the 
time since Michigan last won 
a share of the Big Ten — have 
been leading up to this. Realisti-
cally, it’s been longer than that, 
considering the Wolverines lost 
to the Buckeyes that season. 
The Wolverines haven’t beaten 

Ohio State and won the Big Ten 
in the same season since 2003. 
“It is different,” said senior 
running back Karan Higdon. 
“It’s been awhile since this has 
been a game 
to determine 
our fate in the 
national champi-
onship, for a Big 
Ten Champion-
ship. It definite-
ly is different 
year.”
That isn’t 
exactly true.
Michigan 
was in this same 
position in 2016, 
when it came into The Game 
ranked No. 2, while the Buck-
eyes were No. 3.
We remember how that went. 

The Wolverines played about 
as well as they could, except 
they couldn’t tackle Ohio State 
running back Curtis Samuel on 
a 3rd-and-long. Then JT Bar-
rett squeezed 
out a first down, 
and then Michi-
gan ultimately 
wilted, losing in 
overtime.
If you think 
back further, 
the Wolverines 
were here in 
2006, too, when 
the teams were 
ranked first and 
second, respec-
tively, and once again, the Buck-
eyes won.
What Higdon said is true in 
that this feels like Michigan’s 

best chance to actually go into 
Columbus and win the game in 
quite a while.
The 2016 Wolverines had 
just lost to Iowa, and they were 
probably at a 
talent disadvan-
tage with how 
the Buckeyes’ 
offense was 
clicking. If it 
weren’t for Ohio 
State’s kicker 
that afternoon, 
The Game 
wouldn’t have 
even reached 
overtime — let 
alone double 
overtime — that year.
In 2006, it was a knockdown, 
dragout fight, but Troy Smith 
was Troy Smith, and the Michi-

gan defense really struggled 
against the Buckeyes’ spread 
offense.
This season, though, the 
Wolverines have blown through 
every challenge 
that has come 
their way. They 
killed Wisconsin 
and Penn State, 
and they physi-
cally dominated 
Michigan State, 
even if the score 
didn’t reflect 
the bludgeoning 
that the yardage 
totals did.
Those games 
began the “Revenge Tour” that 
has shaped how this season has 
felt for Michigan.
All the wrongs that have been 

done to the Wolverines over 
coach Jim Harbaugh’s tenure 
have been righted.
There is one more regular-
season score to settle.
 “Everybody in the entire 
country knows what this week-
end is,” said junior defensive 
end Rashan Gary. “We know 
what this weekend is. So we’re 
gonna attack it. It’s been a 
whole year having a bad taste in 
our mouths. We’ve just gotta go 
out, prepare the right way and, 
you know, go out there on Sat-
urday and see what happens.”
Additionally, the Wolverines 
are nearly at full strength. Even 
with the injury to fifth-year 
senior defensive end Chase 
Winovich, who hurt his shoul-
der Saturday against Indiana, 
Michigan has had very good 
luck with injuries. Redshirt 
freshman wide receiver Tarik 
Black came back this season. 
Junior defensive end Rashan 
Gary came back too. And Win-
ovich’s backups, sophomore 
Kwity Paye and freshman 
Aidan Hutchinson, have proven 
capable.
So there are no excuses to be 
had.
It has all been leading up to 
this game for Michigan.
Forget the past, forget what 
has already happened this sea-
son and forget the future for 
now.
If the Wolverines want to 
reach that future, they need to 
win Saturday. It’s as simple as 
that.
You know it. I know it. They 
know it. Now it’s time to see 
if this whole season — the 
10-game win streak, the talk of 
a new attitude in the program, 
the Revenge Tour — is for real, 
or if it’s just another opportu-
nity in Columbus gone to waste.

EVAN AARON/Daily
The Michigan football team will travel to Columbus on Saturday for the Wolverines’ annual rivalry game with Ohio State holding a 10-1 record for the season.

Michigan slips past Indiana, 31-20, Ohio State looms

Oh, you thought this would be 
easy, didn’t you?
With just a week before a 
clash in Columbus, conventional 
wisdom assumed the No. 4 
Michigan football team would 
cruise past Indiana (2-6 Big Ten, 
5-6 overall) on Saturday.
There 
was 
nothing 
easy 
about it, though. Between costly 
offensive miscues and defensive 
lapses, injuries and turnovers, 
and plenty in between, the 
Wolverines’ performance will 
leave much to be desired.
But as the saying goes: a win 
is a win
Against a Big Ten foe in late 
November, Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh will take it.
“When you’re in playoff mode 
— that’s our mindset right —
playoff wins are big,” Harbaugh 
said.
After 
a 
31-20 
comeback 
victory over the Hoosiers, the 
Wolverines 
(8-0, 
10-1) 
will 
square off against Ohio State 
next Saturday with the Big Ten 
East on the line and College 
Football 
Playoff 
hopes 
still 
squarely in the balance.
“Proud of our guys the way 
they played today,” Harbaugh 
said. “Onto the next game, 
onto the big game, onto the 
championship game. Onward.”
It was evident from the 
outset Saturday would yield no 
rout. Running back Stevie Scott 
scored from 13 yards out to give 
Indiana a 7-3 lead with 4:14 left 
in the first quarter.
Newly-minted starting kicker, 
freshman Jake Moody, cut that 
lead to 7-6 on the next drive — 
but only after junior quarterback 
Shea Patterson and redshirt 
junior tight end Zach Gentry 
failed to connect on a seemingly 
easy touchdown. 
Michigan added another field 
goal on the next drive to take 
a 9-7 lead, but, again, wasted a 
precious red zone opportunity. 
In the half, the Wolverines came 
away with just nine points in 
four first half red zone trips.
“I couldn’t put my finger on it,” 
said junior running back Karan 
Higdon said of the struggles. “I 

think it was us just not executing 
and being efficient the way you 
needed to be.”
With 
miscues 
piling 
up, 
responsibility fell on Moody, 
who answered the call dutifully. 
He finished 6-for-6 on field 
goals, a school record for made 
field goals in a game.
Even when Michigan’s offense 
seemed to break, though — like 
on a 41-yard touchdown catch 
by junior tight end Nick Eubanks 
in the second quarter — Indiana 
had an answer, marching down 
the field in three mintues to take 
back the lead.
The most boneheaded mistake 
of the game came at the end of the 
first half. With the clock winding 
down, Patterson found junior 
tight end Sean McKeon near the 
end zone. McKeon was tackled 
short of the goal line, allowing 
the half to expire without adding 
points and the attempt to spike 
the ball in time failed. Video later 
surfaced of an Indiana defensive 
lineman kicking the ball in an 
attempt to delay the snap.
“They made a great play on it, 

a great tackle in the field of play,” 
Harbaugh said. “… There seemed 
to be some problems getting the 
ball back in. Whether that was us 
not getting the ball to the official 
quick enough or seeing that they 
kicked the ball, I don’t know.”
The Wolverines came out of 
the half clearly re-energized 
and 
re-focused, 
particularly 
defensively. 
They 
forced 
a 
three-and-out 
on 
their 
first 
defensive drive and drove 67 
yards in 11 plays for a touchdown 
immediately after to lead 22-17. 
Despite an uneven performance 
throughout, Michigan held onto 
that lead the rest of the night.
“That kind of just tested our 
resiliency. It kind of felt like the 
Northwestern game a little bit, 
just a gritty game, they’re a good 
team,” said junior quarterback 
Shea Patterson. “I think there’s a 
lot of positives to take out of this. 
When you’re tested, you either 
give in to whatever or come out 
resilient.”
Despite the result, Saturday’s 
game will be clouded with 
unease. 
Fifth-year 
senior 

defensive end Chase Winovich 
left in the third quarter with an 
undisclosed injury. Fifth-year 
senior running back Berkley 
Edwards left the game in the 
fourth quarter after getting hit 
on a special teams play.
After the game, Harbaugh 
said Winovich’s x-rays were 
negative. 
Despite 
the 
grim 
nature of the injury, Harbaugh 
was also optimistic Edwards 
would be OK.
For Michigan it was one of 
those games — ugly injuries, 
inefficient red zone play, mental 
and physical errors aplenty.
But, in the end, a win. And 
a win that secures a date with 
Ohio State next Saturday with 
everything on the line.
“We’re 
proving 
stuff 
to 
ourselves,” Higdon said. “That 
we can definitely be the best 
team in the country. That we’re 
definitely a top-four team. And 
that we’re a playoff contender 
and we deserve to be in the 
playoffs. That only happens if we 
continue to dominate each and 
every week.”

Wolverines suffer emotional 

injuries in win over Indiana 

The Michigan football team 
has gone relatively unscathed this 
season in terms of injuries.
Really, the only notable ones 
were redshirt freshman wide 
receiver Tarik Black, who missed 
a majority of the season with a 
broken foot, and junior defensive 
end Rashan Gary, who sat out four 
games with a shoulder issue.
That has pretty much been the 
extent of it for the Wolverines.
On Saturday night, despite 
defeating 
Indiana, 
31-20, 
Michigan’s injury luck turned on 
its head.
It began, in earnest, in the 
third quarter. Fifth-year senior 
defensive end Chase Winovich 
was rushing the passer, matched 
up with the Hoosiers’ right tackle. 
Right guard Simon Stepaniak 
came over to help on Winovich, 
dumped him to the ground hard 
on Winovich’s left shoulder and 
dove on top of him to keep him 
down.
As it turns out, he kept Winovich 
down for quite a while. Winovich 
lay motionless on the field for a few 
moments before being tended to by 
trainers, as his teammates milled 
around on the sideline, hoping 
for the best. Junior quarterback 
Shea Patterson — Winovich’s 
roommate — even walked onto the 
field to give Winovich some words 
of encouragement.
“I don’t know the severity of 
his injury,” Patterson said after 
the game. “I know him really well. 
I just told him I love him, and 
we’re behind him no matter what 
happens. That’s basically all you 
can do. Just him, with his work 
ethic and as a senior in his last 
game … I just wanted to let him 
know I was there and the whole 
team was there for him.”
Reports later surfaced that 
Winovich’s parents joined him in 
the locker room, raising the level 
of concern among Wolverine fans. 
However, Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh said Winovich’s x-rays 
and CT scans were negative after 
the game.
From there, the Wolverines had 

no choice but to rally together.
“It’s a brotherhood,” Gary said. 
“So when you see one of your 
brothers go down, of course you’re 
gonna feel attacked and feel let 
down and hurt. But, you know, 
football is football, and when 
they went out, now the game is 
for them and us. So I tried to play 
any snaps with Chase just how 
he would when I wasn’t playing. 
That’s my brother, and we just had 
to play like that.”
That wasn’t the end of the 
jarring injuries for Michigan.
In the fourth quarter, on a 
kickoff return, fifth-year senior 
backup running back Berkley 
Edwards got blown up while 
trying to block.
The offender, Indiana’s Cam 
Jones, was ejected for targeting, 
while Edwards was eventually 
carted off the field on a stretcher 
and brought to the hospital.
Edwards’ brother, Braylon — 
the legendary former-Wolverines 
receiver — updated the situation 
later via Twitter.
“Berkley, everything looked 
good when he left the stadium,” 
Harbaugh said. “He did have a 
concussion — he had a pretty 
good-sized concussion. He looked 
good when he left here, but he 
was taken to the hospital as a 
precaution, so we’ll have later 
updates there.”
These 
two 
injuries, 
in 
particular, gave Michigan a sour 
taste in its mouth.
After Edwards went down, 
several players were jawing at the 
Hoosiers’ sideline.
“It did get chippy,” said senior 
running back Karan Higdon.
“… Obviously, the situation 
with my brother Berkley Edwards 
didn’t sit well with anybody, and 
that was a situation that was 
unfortunate, and it kind of shook 
the team up a little bit.”
In both Winovich and Edwards’ 
cases, the prognoses were better 
than originally expected.
Still, as Gary and Higdon said, 
the pauses were long and clearly 
emotional. But the Wolverines 
simply had to rebound.
If the final score is any 
indication, they did.

Michigan wins Hall of Fame Tip-off Tournament

UNCASVILLE, 
Conn. 
— 
The first half of Sunday’s 
game started and ended the 
same way: junior center Jon 
Teske catching Providence’s 
defense napping and throwing 
down an easy dunk.
That set the tone for the rest 
of the game. Though it was 
close at the beginning, the No. 
18 Michigan men’s basketball 
team 
(5-0 
overall) 
took 
control and never relented in a 
66-47 win over the Friars (3-2) 
in the championship game 
of the Hall of Fame Tip-off 
Tournament.
The Wolverines got out to an 
early lead after Teske’s dunk. 
Twice, 
freshman 
forward 
Ignas 
Brazdeikis 
received 
long passes from junior guard 
Zavier Simpson and dunked 
them in on the fast break. The 
second time, he hung on the 
rim for a few seconds, savoring 
the moment as he let the ball 
roll down his body.
Providence 
temporarily 
grabbed the momentum with a 
6-0 run, punctuated by a deep 
3-pointer from Maliek White, 
to cut the Wolverines’ lead to 
21-20. But that was the closest 
the Friars got.
On the following possession, 
Teske hit a pick-
and-pop 
three 
— the first of 
his career — to 
keep 
Michigan 
in the lead with 
3:49 remaining 
in 
the 
half. 
From 
there, 
the Wolverines 
capped 
off 
a 
14-2 run with 
Teske’s 
second 
dunk to extend the lead to 
35-22 at halftime.
“At the end of the first 
half, we just wanted to come 
to the locker room excited 
and ready for the second 
half,” Brazdeikis said. “They 
went on their run, I feel like 

towards the end of that first 
half, so then we just bounced 
back.”
Both teams played chippy 
— combining for four fouls in 
the first two minutes of the 
second 
half. 
Providence 
was 
able 
to 
take advantage 
early 
in 
the 
second half by 
grabbing extra 
possession, 
but sophomore 
forward Isaiah 
Livers 
made 
back-to-back 
3-pointers 
to 
keep 
Michigan’s 
lead 
comfortable.
And the Wolverines’ stifling 
defense helped extinguish any 
hope of a comeback. The Friars 
shot just 28.1 percent on field 
goals, while Michigan grabbed 
28 defensive rebounds.

Michigan ran its offense 
through Brazdeikis and Teske 
— who finished with 20 and 
17 points, respectively. The 
rest of the team struggled to 
score, which ultimately kept 
the game from 
being a blowout. 
Simpson 
and 
redshirt 
junior 
Charles 
Matthews — both 
of whom scored 
in double digits 
Saturday — failed 
to get anything 
going offensively, 
combining 
for 
just 
11 
points. 
But even when that happened, 
Teske and Brazdeikis were 
there to grab a board or tip 
the ball in off the glass — and 
that was when they weren’t 
dunking. 
Teske 
had 
three 
dunks and Brazdeikis, two.
With their flashy moves and 

an assist from the defense, the 
outcome was never in doubt.
“Everyone can play on our 
team. It’s not gonna be one 
person that’s gonna be the best 
player on the court every day,” 
Brazdeikis 
said. 
“It’s 
gonna be, one 
day (Simpson), 
one day Jon, 
one 
day 
Charles 
and 
it 
always 
switches 
cause we all 
split the ball, 
so 
it’s 
just 
about 
being 
effective in other ways, and 
our team is just so talented 
that we all just click.”
Added Michigan coach John 
Beilein: “That’s always gonna 
be our mindset going in. We’re 
gonna take what people give 
us.”

Wolverines set to 
face Detroit Mercy

Just two weeks into the season, 
the Michigan women’s basketball 
team (2-0) already has two 
dominant performances under 
its belt. First, the Wolverines 
dismantled Mount St. Mary’s, 
88-40, in the season opener. And 
last Thursday, they cruised past 
Western Michigan, 79-42.
There’s no reason to expect 
anything different to happen 
Monday night, when Michigan 
faces Detroit Mercy (1-3) at Crisler 
Center.
Last season, the Titans finished 
with an abysmal 2-28 record. 
They are currently on a three-
game losing streak, and on paper, 
they don’t match up well against 
the Wolverines.
Detroit Mercy has just two 
players at or over six-feet tall, 
and only one of them — six-foot 
forward Paige Bellman — gets 
meaningful playing time. On 
the other hand, Michigan has 
11 players in the six-foot club — 
including 6-foot-5 senior center 
Hallie Thome.
She has been the Wolverines 
go-to player so far, leading the 
team with 19.5 points and 9.5 
rebounds per contest. Both of 
Michigan’s opponents so far have 
lacked comparable height, thus 
allowing Thome to control the 
paint.
Because 
of 
her 
height 
advantage, Thome often draws 
double teams. But so far, she has 
used solid footwork to weave 
around this. She should have no 
trouble finding the basket come 
Monday, as the Titans don’t seem 
to have a logical answer for her.
With 
their 
length, 
the 
Wolverines have been successful 
under 
the 
glass. 
They’ve 
outrebounded opposing teams 
106 to 46 and could widen the gap 
against Detroit Mercy.
“I think that’s been a difference-

maker kind of our last couple 
games,” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico to WTKA on 
Thursday. “And we talked about 
that a lot coming into tonight.”
When these two schools met 
last season, the Titans initially 
kept it interesting. Early in the 
opening quarter, they drained 
four three-pointers in a row 
to get a head start. And a few 
possessions later, they converted 
another triple to take a 10-point 
lead.
The Wolverines fought back, 
though, tying the game at 20 
by the end of the first frame. 
Michigan 
then 
pulled 
away 
quickly, notching an 86-50 victory.
Detroit Mercy no longer has 
forward Brianne Cohen or guards 
Anja Marinkovic and Nicole 
Urbanick — its three leading 
scorers from last year. Cohen 
and Urbanick were both seniors 
last 
season, 
and 
Marinkovic 
transferred to play at Florida Gulf 
Coast.
Now, forward Lexey Tobel 
leads the Titans with 13 points 
a game. In last year’s meeting, 
she scored a team-high 14 points. 
Bellman is their best rebounder, 
grabbing 7.8 boards per game. She 
also has the most steals and is tied 
for the most blocks, with a total of 
11 and six, respectively.
This will be the Wolverines’ 
sixth time facing Detroit Mercy 
under Barnes Arico. She won the 
last five and will likely win again 
on Monday.
Regardless of the probable 
mismatch, the contest should 
allow Michigan to fine-tune its 
play and work out any remaining 
kinks before the season picks 
up pace. The weekend after 
Thanksgiving, the Wolverines 
will head to Estero, Fla. for the 
Gulf Coast Showcase.
It will also give Michigan a 
chance to further implement its 
depth, which has been a focal 
point this season.

Wolverines lose to Penn State in overtime, 7-6

STATE COLLEGE — A thrilling 
comeback on back-to-back nights 
seemed too good to be true for the 
Michigan hockey team. But what 
ensued on Saturday was thrilling 
nonetheless.
After roaring back from a deficit 
in the third period for the second 
night in a row, the 16th-ranked 
Wolverines could not finish the 
job, falling to No. 5 Penn State in 
overtime, 7-6.
The scoring got off to a quick 
start on the second night of the 
series between the teams.
Sophomore defenseman Quinn 
Hughes was penalized for hooking 
just 0:38 into the game, sending 
the Nittany Lions to an early power 
play.
And less than one minute into the 
one-man advantage, forward Evan 
Barratt got Penn State out to an 
early 1-0 lead. Forward Liam Folkes 
skated up the left wing and passed 
across to Barratt who was set up 
in the slot just outside of the right 
faceoff circle. The duo got freshman 
goaltender Strauss Mann moving 
from right to left in the crease, and 
Barratt slotted the puck out of his 
reach to his left.
Just two minutes later, the 
Nittany Lions struck again.
Forward Aarne Talvitie streaked 
down left wing, shot to the far side 
and into the top right corner of 
the net past the glove of Mann to 
extend the lead to 2-0. With that 
goal, Penn State had struck twine 
on their first two shots of the night. 
After coming up with several big 
stops on Friday, Mann had earned 
his first back-to-back starts and was 
showing signs of struggle, while the 
Michigan defense failed pounce on 
50-50 pucks in its own defensive 
zone, leading to plenty of early 
opportunities for the Nittany Lions. 
However, Mann remained even-
keeled and came up with several big 
stops before the Wolverines cut into 
the lead.
Near the halfway mark of 
the period, junior forward Nick 
Pastujov scored on a loose puck out 
in front of the crease. The initial shot 
came in from sophomore forward 
Josh Becker who streaked up the 
right wing on a pass from freshman 
defenseman 
Nick 
Blankenburg. 

Pastujov corralled the puck after 
Penn State’s defense was unable to 
clear it, making it 2-1.
After Michigan’s initial goal, the 
defense seemed to pick up steam 
and began to win more pucks in 
its own zone. As the defense found 
some temporary success, the offense 
began controlling possession and 
getting more opportunities.
And four minutes after Pastujov 
cut the lead in half, junior forward 
Will Lockwood, tied it up at 2-2. 
Junior forward Jake Slaker found 
Lockwood in the left faceoff circle. 
As Lockwood attempted to pass to 
an open sophomore forward Josh 
Norris, the puck took a deflection 
off a defender’s stick and past junior 
goaltender Peyton Jones.
The period ended 2-2 with a 
combined 33 shots for the two 
teams.
In the second period, the 
defensive intensity continued for 
the Wolverines. With that came 
some opportunities for offense, but 
they failed to capitalize.
After a pair of minor penalties 
on freshman forward Garrett Van 
Wyhe and Penn State defenseman 
Kevin 
Kerr, 
four-on-four 
play 
ensued, and the Nittany Lions 
regained the lead as Barratt skated 
into the offensive zone towards the 
right faceoff circle with the puck, 
seemingly unmarked, and fired past 
Mann.
Four minutes later Barratt scored 
again to complete the hat trick and 

gave Penn State a 4-2 lead heading 
into the second intermission. It was 
the same deficit Michigan faced on 
Friday night.
Early in the third period, the 
Wolverines pulled within one as 
Hughes found sophomore forward 
Dakota Raabe from the left side of 
the ice as he put the puck past Jones, 
making the score 4-3.
But the Nittany Lions were 
stubborn, not wanting to replicate 
the events of Friday. Just when it 
appeared Michigan had regained 
momentum, Penn State answered 
again and jumped out to a two-goal 
lead once more.
“(The defense was) just casual,” 
said Michigan coach Mel Pearson. 
“Not picking guys up, not playing 
aggressive at times. We looked 
confused in our zone, everybody 
trying to do somebody else’s job. 
Not trusting the communication, I 
mean a number of things.”
Then, once again, the Wolverines 
scored to pull within a goal on a 
deflection from Pastujov, only to be 
answered yet again to make it 6-4 
with eight minutes remaining.
But the opportunity was there 
once more for Michigan, and for the 
third time in the period, they pulled 
within one goal. The puck found 
Van Wyhe with time and space in 
the right slot, and he fired a wrister 
to the top left corner into the net. 
“It’s crazy,” Pearson said. “Two 
nights in a row we’re down 4-2 
going into the third period, and we 

come out and score the first goal to 
make it 4-3, and here we go again.”
Then, with 1:05 remaining in the 
period, Norris fired a shot towards 
the net, and the puck snuck under 
the crossbar on a deflection off the 
stick of Lockwood to tie the game at 
six and send the game to overtime.
The comeback came was all for 
naught, though.

The Nittany Lions won the 
opening draw in overtime and 
fired the puck on net. Mann was 
unable to corral puck, and the 
rebound spewed out in front of the 
crease. Forward Sam Sternschein 
won the race to the net and scored, 
extinguishing the short-lived joy 
of the comeback for Michigan and 
winning the game for Penn State.
“I’ve been in this game 37 years 
in college hockey, and I don’t think 
I’ve ever seen an ending quite like 
that on an innocent play,” Pearason 
said. “They just pushed forward 
to the puck, they shoot it and it 
goes off Strauss, he can’t control 
the rebound and they beat us to 
the puck… so, a tough way to lose, 
especially when you don’t get any 
points out of it –– points are so 
critical. We got a lot of work to do, 
but I did like the resiliency our team 
showed tonight.”
In a series where both sides 
showcased 
their 
offensive 
firepower, the Wolverines’ defense 
was unable to replicate the third-
period performance that earned 
them a victory on Friday.

Why Michigan/Ohio State will win The Game

I 

get it.
You look at the recent 
history against Ohio State 
— losing 13 
of that last 
14 matchups 
— and you 
think a loss 
is inevitable. 
Then, you see 
the Michigan 
football 
team has to 
rewrite that 
history in 
Columbus, 
where it hasn’t won since 2000. 
And it’ll try to do it against one 
of the country’s best coaches, 
with one of the country’s best 
quarterbacks beside him.
A lackluster 31-20 win over 
Indiana surely inspires more 
concern than confidence about 
beating the Buckeyes.
I ask you to do one thing: 
forget all of it.
“It’s a different game, and 
we’re going to make sure we’ll 
handle our business,” said 
senior running back Karan 
Higdon. “They still have to play 
us on Saturday. Nothing that 
happened in the past matters at 
this point.”
The rivalry game will be 
different in more ways than one. 
The Wolverines will beat Ohio 
State. Michigan will claim sole 
ownership of the Big Ten East 
title.
What’s at stake is very 
apparent. And the Wolverines 
are approaching it with 
measured responses.
“Everybody in the whole 
entire country knows what this 
week is,” said junior defensive 
end Rashan Gary. “We know 
what this week is, so we’re gonna 
attack it. It’s been a whole year of 
having a bad taste in our mouths. 
We just gotta go out, prepare 
the right way and go out there 
Saturday and see what happens.”
The first, and most obvious 
reason the tables will turn 
this year is quarterback Shea 
Patterson. John O’Korn was 
abysmal in “The Game” last 
season, sailing balls left and 
right and throwing a game-
sealing interception facing 
marginal pressure.
This season, the Buckeyes 
rank 77th in passing yards 
allowed per game (237.4), and 

have struggled to contain 
quarterbacks that the 
Wolverines’ defense outright 
punished like Nebraska’s 
Adrian Martinez, Penn State’s 
Trace McSorley and Indiana’s 
Peyton Ramsey. Those three 
quarterbacks all threw for at 
least 260 yards and a touchdown 
against them. Patterson is 
the most accurate and mobile 
quarterback Michigan has had 
since Denard Robinson, the last 
quarterback to beat Ohio State 
back in 2011.
Patterson is also playing 
behind an offensive line that 
is significantly better than last 
season’s, which allowed five 
sacks on O’Korn. Saturday’s 
game serves as a homecoming 
for offensive line coach Ed 
Warinner, who coached for the 
Buckeyes from 2012-16, and he 
will get to showcase his latest 
work to his former team. The 
loss of Ohio State defensive end 
Joey Bosa, the likely No. 1 overall 
pick in the NFL Draft, further 
opens the door for an impactful 
O-line performance.
The second reason, 
conversely, is Buckeyes 
quarterback Dwayne Haskins 
and his offensive line. The 
numbers don’t lie — Haskins 
is third in the country in 
passing yards per game, and 36 
touchdowns. Haskins has also 
been sacked just 13 times. But 
the offensive line has been far 
below average for the Buckeyes 
in the run game — 54th in the 
country in yards per game — 
even with J.K. Dobbins and 
Mike Weber in the backfield. In 
other words, facing Michigan’s 
top-ranked defense, Haskins 
will have to throw.
Few quarterbacks have found 
success this season against 
the Wolverines. Immobile 
quarterbacks like Haskins 
haven’t fared any better.
And the only aspect of the 
team worse than its offensive 
line is its run defense.
Maryland’s Anthony 
McFarland ran rampant on the 
Buckeyes in a 52-51 shootout 
(Yes, the same Maryland that 
only dropped 10 points against 
Michigan), registering 298 yards 
and two touchdowns on just 21 
carries.
Senior running back Karan 
Higdon, who averages nearly 

111 rushing yards per game, will 
have a field day in Columbus.
So fire away with your takes:
“Jim Harbaugh can’t win the 
big one.”
“Michigan will just choke.”
“They can’t win in Columbus.”
And they would all be wrong. 
This isn’t about cliches or empty 
narratives. The Wolverines 
are unequivocally better than 
the Buckeyes, who have rarely 
looked impressive against the 
same competition.
Michigan’s sole loss is a 
one touchdown heartbreaker 
at No. 3 Notre Dame in the 
season opener. Purdue romped 
Ohio State by four possessions, 
and the Boilermakers hope to 
become bowl eligible with a win 
next week.
For Ohio State fans and 
Michigan skeptics, harping on 
the past is easy, but this time the 
past will not matter.
“Just another game,” 
Patterson said. “We understand 
the tradition and the meaning 
behind it, but we’re going to 
attack it the same way we have 
the past 10, 11 weeks. We know 
they’re a good ball club at their 
place, but we’re just going to 
prepare and come out firing.”
And with coming out firing, a 
win will follow.

S

aturday’s game will be the 
biggest 
Michi-
gan football 
game in 
at least 12 
years. For 
Ohio State, 
it won’t even 
approach the 
top 10.
That’s not 
to say the 
Buckeyes 
don’t care about Saturday’s 
game; obviously, they do. 
Instead, it is to say the pressure 
will be disproportionately 
slanted toward one side. The 
line opened at Michigan -4, and 
that’s properly indicative of 
which team has looked better 
all year. 
But what, in the recent 
history of Michigan football, 
leads you to believe this 
program is capable of handling 
that pressure?
Take the 2016 game, for 
example. Forget the JT 
Barrett play for a moment. The 
Wolverines entered the fourth 
quarter up 17-14, then gained 
a total of five yards, neglecting 
every chance to put the game 
away.
Take the 2012 game for 
another. Michigan entered 
halftime up 21-20. In the second 
half Michigan failed to cross 
midfield, turned the ball over 

three times and didn’t score. 
How about 2007? The 
Wolverines came into the home 
game having a chance to claim 
the Big Ten East with a win, 
then scored just 3 points all 
afternoon.
Let’s revisit 2004. Michigan 
was favored heading into a 
matchup against an Ohio State 
team that was 3-4 in conference 
play. The Wolverines led 14-7 
after the first quarter then got 
their doors blown off — giving 
up 27 unanswered points in a 
blowout loss.
The Wolverines haven’t won 
in Columbus since 2000 and 
have beaten Ohio State just 
three times since the turn of the 
century. There’s a foundational 
reason for that beyond “Ohio 
State is usually better.” This 
game has devolved into less of 
a rivalry and more of an annual 
event to breed self-loathing.
Which brings us to this year, 
a game Michigan absolutely 
should win, but a game in which 
the alternative would be entirely 
unsurprising.
There’s plenty of reason to 
believe this Michigan team is 
going to finally lay this two-
decade-long nightmare to rest. 
It has the best quarterback in 
recent program history in Shea 
Patterson. It has an historically 
great defense anchoring the 
other side of the ball. It has 
a signature road win against 

(a retrospectively average) 
Michigan State team under its 
belt. 
But be honest: any optimism 
is clouded with fear. Confidence 
is guarded with ample caution. 
Ohio State has owned Michigan 
for the better part of my lifetime, 
and 10 wins against inferior 
opponents doesn’t change that 
framework until the Wolverines 
overcome it.
Not to mention this Buckeyes 
team — while in the midst of 
a “down” season by its lofty 
standards — is certainly no 
pushover. They have a shoo-in 
all-Big Ten quarterback and 
dynamic offensive weapons 
aplenty; Ohio State is still 
averaging nearly 42 points per 
game. They are still a top-10 
team nationally, and you best 
believe they will be motivated to 
continue the reign of dominance 
— and, by the way, play for its 
third Big Ten championship in 
the last five years.
Each side is coming in 
with predictable hymns of 
motivation.
“Everybody in the whole 
entire country knows what 
this week is,” said junior 
defensive end Rashan Gary after 
Saturday’s win over Indiana. 
“We know what this week is. So 
we’re going to attack. It’s been a 
whole year of having a bad taste 
in our mouth, so we’ve just got 
to go out and prepare the right 
way.”
Ohio State quarterback 
Dwayne Haskins told reporters 
he has watched Michigan play 
every week. 
One is taken with measured 
confidence of a program that 
has dominated for 20 years. 
The other comes with a hint of 
desperation. One is the bully, 
the other is the downtrodden 
victim.
Until I see those roles are 
reversed on the field, I won’t 
believe it. For the 16th time in 
the last 18 years, Ohio State 
is going to beat Michigan on 
Saturday, and the hopes and 
dreams of this Michigan football 
season will come crashing 
down in the most disappointing 
fashion possible.

From redzone struggles, Jake Moody has historic performance

With the clock ticking, the 
Michigan football team thought it 
could score one last time before the 
half against Indiana.
Trailing 17-15, the Wolverines 
were in the redzone following 
a 41-yard reception by redshirt 
junior tight end Zach Gentry. With 
only one timeout, Michigan ran 
three times. Then junior tight end 
Sean McKeon caught a pass at the 
two-yard line, getting tackled in 
bounds at the two-yard line. Time 

was vanishing when it didn’t have 
to.
As 
halftime 
approached 
following 
McKeon’s 
reception, 
Shea Patterson set the offense 
to spike the ball, stop the clock 
and kick a field goal. The referee 
carried the ball to position it, 
dropped it before he could give it to 
center Cesar Ruiz and an Indiana 
player kicked it away to lengthen 
the referee’s scramble.
Halftime adjustments in the 
locker room were coming next.
“We just didn’t execute well 
enough,” said redshirt sophomore 

tight end Nick Eubanks. “… We’ve 
got a lot of work to do.”
It’s as simple as that.
Michigan made eight separate 
trips 
in 
the 
redzone 
during 
Saturday’s 31-20 win over the 
Hoosiers, and scored a touchdown 
only once — a two-yard run by 
Karan Higdon, assisted by a pass 
interference the previous play.
Five of those trips ended with 
two short-yardage runs, and either 
an incomplete or short pass before 
the firstdown marker. On one of 
those instances, the Wolverines 
failed to find paydirt after a 

dropped ball by Gentry. It was 
a mishmash of monotonous but 
sustained errors that raise red flags 
heading into the season finale at 
Ohio State.
“They did a great job,” Higdon 
said. “We didn’t execute as well as 
we wanted to a couple times. We 
had some dropped balls, miscues 
and we can’t have that. I’d rather 
that happen now then next week.”
But Michigan’s struggles came 
with a silver lining. Through 
the Wolverines’ failed redzone 
execution emerged much-needed 
consistency from the place kicking 
unit. Freshman kicker Jake Moody 
took over field goal duties for Quinn 
Nordin, who Moody said didn’t feel 
good enough to enter the game.
Moody, who typically handles 
kickoffs, went 6-for-6 on the day 
— all within 33 yards — to break a 
Michigan football record last set 
by Nordin for most field goals in a 
game..

From a numbers and momentum 
standpoint, 
Moody 
was 
the 
difference maker.
“You talk about 139 years of 
Michigan football, and set a record 
six field goals,” Harbaugh said. 
“Cool customer, good thing for a 
kicker. … Every single field goal was 
big today.”
Added Moody: “The guys out 
there made it easy for me, the 
snaps and the holds. … I’ve been 
practicing all season. Quinn’s 
been a great role model for me. He 
taught me what to do when you get 
out there to get your mind right to 
kick.”
Harbaugh noted that his historic 
performance wouldn’t guarantee a 
starting spot for next week. While 
the perfect day could offer peace of 
mind, the performance was rooted 
in the offense’s inability to score 
touchdowns. Recording 507 yards 
of offense is usually conducive to 
more than 31 points.

“Just playing in the Big Ten,” 
Patterson cited for the offense’s 
shortcomings. “… Not everything is 
gonna go your way. I thought they 
had a pretty good scheme, pretty 
good defense. We just took what 
they gave us. I thought our defense 
put us in a pretty good position.”
The offense was not without 
its successes. Patterson rifled a 
41-yard touchdown to a wide-
open Eubanks. And if you’re really 
reaching, 
Higdon’s 
touchdown 
demonstrated that the red zone 
woes are fixable.
The Wolverines will have a week 
to do just that. They repeat the 
phrase “one game at a time” like a 
greeting, and a short-term memory 
is more of a demand than a request 
with the Buckeyes looming.
But if just for Saturday, the day 
rightfully belonged to Jake Moody.
“This 
guy 
was 
a 
sniper,” 
Patterson said. “He did a hell of a 
job.”
