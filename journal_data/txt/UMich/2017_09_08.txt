Student veterans attended 

orientation in the Pond room of 
the Michigan Union Thursday 
evening and learned about 
the various resources and 
initiatives to support them on 
campus. The orientation was 
led by Psychology Lecturer 
Eric Fretz, Philip Larson, 
program 
director 
for 
the 

Student Veterans Assistance 
Program, and members of 
the Peer Advisors for Veteran 
Education.

The 
incoming 
students 

had 
the 
opportunity 
to 

familiarize themselves with 
various community members 
and programs dedicated to 
ensuring 
their 
success 
— 

specifically Fretz’s Veteran 
Success course.

Fretz 
combined 
his 

background 
in 
education 

and 
military 
service 
and 

collaborated with Larson and 
others to develop a series of 
modules intended to teach 
student veterans necessary 
skills, such as study strategies, 
financial 
tips 
and 
health 

and safety guidelines. He 
emphasized the importance 
of his modules and explained 
how learning these skills at 
young age can help prepare 
for the future.

“I already taught a Learning 

How to Learn course for 
psychology and of course the 
vets need it as much as any 
other incoming first year, so I 
started taking chunks of that 
and delivering it to them at 
the meeting,” Fretz said. “I 
also have a large, self-taught 
background with finance, and 
I’ve learned a lot of lessons 

the hard way and I figured 
this could be used to clarify 
to people that you can have a 
secure retirement--you have 
to know about it and start 
early, but most people don’t 
know about it and don’t start 
early.”

The 
Veteran 
Success 

course 
has 
been 
praised 

not 
only 
because 
of 
its 

straightforwardness but also 
because of Fretz’s ability to 
connect with the student 
veterans. 
Larson 
himself 

applauded 
Fretz 
for 
his 

no-nonsense 
and 
relatable 

tone.

“I think he relates well 

When LSA sophomore Leah 

Weinstein entered college last 
year, like many, she didn’t 
know exactly what she wanted 
to do after graduation. She 
knew she wanted to work 
abroad in some capacity, but 
it wasn’t until later in the year 
that the Peace Corps became a 
real option in her mind.

“I always knew what it was 

but I met a few people who had 
done or were going to do it and 
it just kind of became more 
prevalent to me as an option,” 
Weinstein said. “I’m interested 
in human rights and women’s 
health and so I would love to 
work abroad teaching English 
or in a community center or 
something like that, and the 
Peace Corps allows you to (do 
that).”

Weinstein is certainly not 

the only University of Michigan 
student to express interest 
in the program. Since former 
President John F. Kennedy

President 
Mark

and the provost team for his 
position and spoke on the 
importance of academia on 
a national scale at his hiring 
reception in the Michigan 
League Thursday afternoon. 
About 75 students and faculty 
members 
attended 
the 

reception and address.

The University has been 

without a permanent provost 
since former Provost Martha 
Pollack was appointed the 
14th 
president 
of 
Cornell 

University 
last 
spring. 

Between Pollack’s departure 
and Philbert’s hiring, Public 
Policy Prof. Paul Courant 

acted as interim provost.

Philbert has served as dean 

of the School of Public Health 
since 2011 before becoming 
provost and Vice President for 
Academic Affairs.

In his opening remarks, 

President Schlissel described 
the provost position as one 
of great significance at the 
University, since the provost 
presides over all academic 
initiatives and oversees the 
University’s budget.

“The 
beauty 
and 
the 

challenge and the importance 
of the provost position is it 
sees the whole playing field,” 
Schlissel said. “The value of

resources are always limited,

U.S. Secretary of Education 

Betsy 
DeVos 
announced 

Thursday 
afternoon 
the 

Department 
of 
Education 

will replace what she called a 
“failed” system of addressing 
sexual misconduct on campus 
with a new focus on due process 

and 
the 
rights 
of 
accused 

students. Some cheered the 
change of course on enforcing 
Title IX, but many — including 
sexual assault survivors and 
advocates at the University of 
Michigan — read Thursday’s 
announcement as a rollback of 
Obama-era guidelines, with no 
clear plan of action in sight.

In a speech at George Mason 

University, 
DeVos 
railed 

against “kangaroo courts,” or 
the complex legal processes 
many universities have in place 
to redress reports of sexual 
misconduct. All parties — but 
especially accused students, she 
said — experience violations of 
their due process rights during 
investigations.

“The notion that a school must 

diminish due process rights to 
better serve the ‘victim’ only 

creates more victims,” she said. 
“Any perceived offense can 
become a full-blown Title IX 
investigation. But if everything 
is harassment, then nothing is.”

Under 
former 
President 

Barack Obama, the Department 
of 
Education’s

Rights

a book that was sold at teh 
original borders book store in 
ann arbor, MI???? this week 
just gets weirder

FRIDAY’S BICENTENNIAL FEATURE: GOIN’ NUTS

University 
of 
Michigan 

paleontologists 
are 

investigating a construction 
site 
in 
Byron 
Township, 

Michigan, 
after 
workers 

excavated 
the 
fossils 
of 

what appeared to be a giant 
prehistoric mammal Aug. 31.

According to the Associated 

Press, University researchers 
identified 
the 
remains 
as 

bones from a mastodon. Eagle 
Creek 
Homes, 
the 
home-

building company developing 
the site where the bones 
were found, contacted Prof. 
Dan Fisher, director of the 
Museum of Paleontology.

Fisher wrote in an interview 

the 
bones 
are 
relatively 

well preserved, and appear 
to be from an adult female 
specimen. At this moment, 
University researchers have 
excavated part of the lower 
jaw, part of the skull, some 
limb bones, part of the pelvis 
and some neck vertebrae.

Mastodons 
roamed 

throughout 
the 
North 

American 
landmass 
until 

their extinction 10,000 to 
11,000 years ago. Mastodon 
and mammoth discoveries are 
not uncommon in the state of 
Michigan; Fisher estimates 
two to three discoveries are 
made in the state each year.

In October 2015, another 

mastodon 
fossil 
was 

discovered in Chelsea, Mich. 
in 
a 
soybean 
field. 
The 

skeleton was later donated 

to the University to be 
studied and later put on 
display. 

Eagle 
Creek 
Homes 

currently holds five large 
pieces of the mastodon 
skeleton, as well as a few 
smaller pieces.

Fisher 
said 
the 

fossil’s fate is currently 
unknown. He explained 
the fossil first needs to 
be 
preserved, 
cleaned 

and dried. The owner 
may then choose to keep 
it local or donate it to 
the University. However, 
it may be a while before 
students can view the 
bones. 

“The 
Museum 

of 
Paleontology, 
as 

organized 
currently, 

does not itself have a 
public exhibit area for 
recent 
finds,” 
Fisher 

wrote. “This may work 
differently when we move 
into the new Biological 
Science Building during 
the course of next year.”

Every Friday, the Michigan Daily will be 
republishing an article from the Daily’s 
archives from a moment in University 
history. This week’s is from September 
23, 1979 by Maynard Slezgo. 

SEPT 23, 1979— “NEVER ARE 

PEOPLE so tall as when they stoop to 

feed a squirrel.”

Ambrose Fleming is proud of that 

motto, which graces the doorway of 

his treetop condominium near the 

East Engineering building. It took 

Fleming two years to chew each letter 

into the bark with his own pointy 

teeth.

“A lot of squirrels these days think 

we older squirrels sell out when we 

accept hand-outs from students on 

the Diag. It’s just not true,” explains 

Fleming, beating his tiny forpaws 

on the ground. “We entertain the 

students by being cute and furry, and 

they pay us with food. It’s simply a 

question of free enterprise. It’s been 

going on for years, and now we are a 

stronger species than ever.”

The statistics bear out Fleming’s 

words. More than 400 of the brown 

and gray rodents are expected to 

inhabit the Diag this fall. Scurrying 

over sidewalks, scampering down 

trees, dodging cars on. E. University 

Ave., squirrels are as important a part 

of Ann Arbor lore as Shakey Jake 

and his famous rasp. And yet, who 

are the squirrels, these funny, furry 

freeloaders who would take a walnut 

right from your hand, and maybe 

your index finger with it? And what, 

exactly, do they want?

“Housing and education, that’s 

what,” snaps Dorothy Jakuboski, 

leader of the Squirrels Unite Now 

(SUN). “Sure, they talk about walnuts 

and acorns, but they won’t let us into 

the libraries. They say we’ll chew up 

the books and leave droppings in the 

carrels, but is that so much different 

than what humans do?”

Ann Arbor’s squirrel population 

has swelled along with increasing 

student numbers during the past 

15 years. Growth has been slow but 

steady, and has put

the Diag housing market on the 

endangered species list. Most Diag 

trees house 20 squirrels per year, with 

a turnover rate that would make any 

landlord shudder. Moreover, the trees 

must be shared with birds – nearby 

nests lower property values by an 

estimated 20 per cent – and bugs.

“The housing is atrocious on 

the Diag,” complains Jakuboski. 

“While the Diag is near the student 

and restaurant garbage bins, it’s a 

ghetto – the Squirrel Ghetto. The 

older squirrels are established on the 

top limbs, but we younger ones have 

to suffer next to those birds.” Many 

younger squirrels, however, claim 

they neither need nor want human 

assistance, and that conservative 

elders such as Fleming would be 

better off as “jelly beneath someone’s 

radials.”’

BEYOND THE LIBERAL SUN 

members are terrorist squirrels, 

including Lance Frye and a de-tailed 

radical who would be identified only 

as Frank. “Homo sapiens are morons,” 

Frank states flatly. “Especially first 

year students. They never realize 

they’re taking their lives into their 

hands when they offer one of us food.” 

He pulls back his, whiskers and bares 

his shiny incisors. “These babies will 

liberate us,” he seethes, clacking his 

teeth rapidly up and down.

“My plan is to steal one of those 

frisbees someday and take it up to a 

tree and tear it to shreds,” Frye boasts. 

“That’ll get those humans – and their 

little dogs, too!”

Squirrels complain that their 

cancer rate has skyrocketed since they 

started accepting hand-outs of white 

bread, Fritos, and Jujubes. But hunger 

is an oppression not easily reckoned 

with,. and the majority of squirrels 

will eat whatever they can find.

“Oh, yes, we eat hand-outs,” says 

Hedda Buttrey, a delicate mother of 30 

who describes herself as “remarkably 

normal.” She adds, “We’ll take a 

few chips or something from those 

people carrying books, or even bits of 

sandwhiches from those dirty teen-

agers who always drink that cooking 

wine. But we’re not afraid to dig for 

acorns when we have to. We’re proud, 

but practical.”

Buttrey claims that the worst 

aspect of campus life is the annual 

spring Hash Bash. “I lost three sons 

last year,” she sniffles, her nose 

a-quiver. “One was trampled by a 

greasy high school boy in a leather 

jacket, another was hit by a van, and 

the youngest was mauled by a dog 

someone shoved onto our tree.”

Dog attacks, in fact, are the 

leading cause of death 

among 

squirrels, second only to automobile 

tires. “The day they forgot about 

leash laws was the day I had to 

give up my freedom,” Buttrey 

says bitterly. “There was a brief 

protest with the ‘Kill the Canines’ 

movement in the late sixties, but 

most of the protestors ended up 

torn to shreds, buried in some dog’s 

backyard storage hole.”

Another squirrel, who refused 

to be identified, asked about the 

current digs of Ann Arbor’s garbage 

can preacher, Dr. Diag. “That guy 

was the voice of the squirrels,” says 

the squirrel. “We learned the Greek 

alphabet, some Shakespeare, and a lot 

about politics. Now we hear he’s gone. 

Shakey Jakes? Shakey Jake! We can’t 

even understand the dude!”

With winter creeping ever closer, 

the Diag squirrels are anticipating 

a rough season. “It’s a good time to 

mate,” Ambrose Fleming observes 

philosophically. “Otherwise, we just 

hibernate.”

“And tell all those people they 

can feed me anytime they 

want,” Fleming implores. “I 

won’t bite. How could 

someone as cute as 

me bite anyone?”

The Museum of 
Paleontology, as 

organized currently, 
does not itself have 
a public exhibit area 

for recent finds. 
This may work 

differently when we 
move into the new 
Biological Science 

Building


“immediate action” upon notice 
of harassment at the expense of 
receiving federal funding. To 
date, the OCR has conducted 
435 investigations into colleges’ 
mishandling of sexual assault; 
the University’s case opened 
in 2014 and remains pending. 
Upon 
DeVos’ 
appointment 

under President Donald Trump, 
many braced for a dismantling 
of stringent guidelines.

Jennifer Salvatore, founding 

partner at Salvatore, Prescott 
and Porter law firm, noted an 
unfortuate lack of surprise at 
the announcement.

“It’s 
disappointing 
but 

not 
surprising 
to 
see 
this 

administration roll back these 
guidelines,” 
Salvatore 
said. 

“The 2011 Dear Colleague letter 
helped provide guidance to 
universities in an important 
area and put renewed focus 
on the very real problem of 
sexual 
assault 
on 
campus. 

There has been a sea change 
in the last ten years in terms 
of 
how 
campuses 
address 

sexual 
assault. 
and 
while 

the processes put in place by 
colleges are not always perfect, 
the rollback of guidance that 
clarified necessary protections 
for victims is not the solution.” 

University 
alum 
Fabiana 

Diaz, an advocate and survivor 
herself, met with DeVos over 
the summer as a part of a 
summit on sexual assault. She 
said she voiced her concern 
about survivors taking on the 
“burden” of advocacy work, and 
pled with DeVos to preserve 
Title IX protections.

Diaz said she believed DeVos 

alluded to her remarks in her 
speech.

“A survivor told me that 

she is tired of feeling like the 
burden of ensuring her school 
addresses Title IX falls on her 
shoulders,” DeVos said. “She is 
right. The burden is not hers, 
nor is it any student’s burden.”

Still, Diaz said, she was 

perplexed 
by 
the 
mixed 

messages in the announcement.

“(DeVos) told me she heard 

me that day … and I do feel like 
she came with a little bit more 
compassion today,” she said. 
“But she still made it sound 
like a 50/50 issue of accusers’ 
rights being violated, when 
in reality, survivors are much 
more vulnerable. I still don’t 
know what my rights were in 
my investigation.”

Diaz’s case was adjudicated 

at the University before the 
wave of activism on campus 
around 
sexual 
assault 

awareness. 
Following 
the 

Dear Colleague letter, a high-
profile case involving a former 
football player and protests, the 
University conducted its own 
campus climate survey in 2015 
under 
University 
President 

Mark Schlissel: 11 percent of all 
students reported experiencing 
non-consensual 
sexual 

behavior. The Sexual Assault 
Awareness 
and 
Prevention 

Center spearheaded a push for 
more trainings on bystander 
intervention and consent. And 

after a lengthy — and public — 
revision process, the University 
released an updated sexual 
misconduct policy last summer.

Much of the new policy

the 

concerns 
of 
unfairness 

DeVos raised in her speech: 
witnesses’ information is now 
disclosed to both parties in an 
investigation; the definition of 
consent is much clearer; and an 
independent, expert external 
reviewer 
each 
investigation; 

respondents 
and 
claimants 

are now able to appeal to an 
external, third-party reviewer 
if they take issue with the 
findings.

Deborah 
Gordon 
is 
a 

Michigan-based attorney who 
has represented a number of 
accused 
University 
students 

— including a controversial 
John Doe case that made it to a 
federal court last winter — and 
alleged the University’s updates 
still don’t do enough to ensure 
due process. Still, however, she 
noted the University’s internal 
processes, pacing with trends 

in other federal policies like 
the travel ban — are unlikely 
to be significantly affected by 
changes at OCR.

“The University drank the 

Kool-Aid on sexual assault,” 
she said. “They’ll still operate 
under the cover of ‘Dear 
Colleague’ to pursue these 
investigations.”

University 
spokeswoman 

Kim Broekhuizen wrote in an 
email statement the University 
remains committed to making 
campus “as safe as possible.”

“At this time, we will 

continue to follow our current 
policies and procedures for 
addressing matters of sexual 
misconduct on our campus,” 
she 
wrote. 
“We 
will 
be 

following the rule making 
process closely.”

More troubling to sexual 

assault advocates was the 
ambiguity of DeVos’ speech 
as to next steps for DOE and 
the OCR. DeVos suggested 
alternative measures such as 
regional Title IX investigation 
centers or task forces of 
lawyers, but introduced no 
concrete policy initiative.

Rackham 
student 
Nicole 

Bedera 
researches 
colleges’ 

interpretations of Title IX across 
the 
country, 
and 
expressed 

concern about the implications 
of DeVos’ lack of clarity.

“It is hard to know exactly 

what the impact of DeVos’ 
statements will be,” she wrote 
in an email interview. “What is 
clear is that DeVos’ main focus 
moving forward appears to 
be the protection of students 
accused of sexual misconduct 
— and particularly those who 
have 
been 
falsely 
accused. 

Considering the empirical data 
we have on the rarity of false 
allegations of sexual assault, 
this is a misguided approach to 
take.”

Most 
methodical 
studies 

of sexual assault place false 
reporting statistics from 2-8 

percent of all reports of sexual 
misconduct. 
Bedera 
wrote 

DeVos’ misinterpretations could 
irreparably damage survivors’ 
claims.

“In all likelihood, it suggests 

DeVos’ 
misunderstanding 
of 

what constitutes sexual assault 
and that could have very real 
and very harmful implications 
for survivors on campus,” she 
concluded.

Many experts agree both 

red tape and broad definitions 
of 
harassment 
in 
campus 

sexual misconduct policies can 
threaten due process rights; a 
group of researchers from the 
Harvard Law School submitted 
a memo to DOE earlier this 
month urging the department 

to reevaluate “Dear Colleague” 
directives 
as 
such. 
Gordon 

added many processes rush to 
assume the accused student’s 
guilt.

“You can’t pick and choose 

who you give due process to, 
and I’m happy someone’s finally 
talking about due process … even 
if it is Betsy DeVos,” she said.

Still, 
statements 
from 

various actors signal a steady 
course in the University’s own 
proceedings. SAPAC released a 
statement Thursday affirming 
its commitment to the campus 
community.

Diaz, 
a 
former 
SAPAC 

volunteer, said she’s hopeful 
about the University’s positive 
trajectory 
in 
protecting 

survivors’ rights.

“I’m proud of the way (the 

University) has stepped up, and 
we have to set the example,” 
she said. “We definitely have 
Brock Turners on our campus. 
I challenge the University to 
stand with survivors.”

Diaz went on to recount 

her own sexual assault during 
the Summer Bridge Scholars 
program before her freshman 
year.

“I got raped on my second 

day on this campus and these 
freshmen are just stepping foot 
onto (it),” she said. 

Despite 
the 
University’s 

concerted efforts, she warned 
of the consequences of top-
down messaging from DOE 
on 
individuals’ 
perception 

of safety within the system. 
As of the 2015 survey, just 
3.6 percent of students who 
experienced 
nonconsensual 

behavior reported to an official 
University resource.

“It’s already happening. And 

the process already isn’t easy 
for a survivor. I would not be 
surprised if reporting rates go 
down… it’s an awful message the 
beginning of the semester for 
students to hear,” she reflected.

But 
like 
other 
student 

advocates 
and 
protesters 

signaled Thursday, she said 
she’s not giving up.

“It 
gives 
me 
rage 
and 

motivation to keep on fighting,” 
she said.

Harper cited Williamsen’s 

previous position as the Title 
IX coordinator at Swarthmore 
College and Title IX deputy 
coordinator for Prevention at 
Carleton College. 

“Dr. 
Williamsen 
brings 

to 
this 
role 
many 
years 

of 
experience 
in 
sexual 

misconduct 
prevention, 

education 
and 
response 

efforts,” Harper wrote. “She 
is also a leader in the field’s 

national conversation.”

Williamsen’s 
experience 

with federal enforcement is 
increasingly relevant, as U.S. 
Secretary of Education Betsy 
DeVos announced a change 
of course in campus sexual 
assault regulations Thursday 
afternoon. Under the Obama 
administration, 
the 
U.S. 

Department 
of 
Education’s 

Office 
of 
Civil 
Rights 

wielded Title IX to pressure 
schools into more stringent 
investigations 
of 
sexual 

misconduct complaints. Since 
2014, the University has been 
one of about 240 schools across 
the country undergoing OCR 
investigation for mishandling 
students’ cases. Swarthmore 
was also under investigation 
during 
Williamsen’s 
tenure 

after students filed federal 
complaints 
against 
the 

university’s 
sexual 
assault 

policies.

“These 
new 
(Title 
IX 

coordinator) jobs are really 
not 
just 
about 
compliance 

anymore, (but also campus 
climate),” Williamsen told the 
Chronicle of Higher Education 
in 2014.

In an email to SAPAC staff 

and volunteers, Bazzy thanked 
her team for their support.

“Thank you all for your 

amazing work to continue 
to 
support 
our 
survivor 

community 
and 
provide 

preventive education to our 
campus,” she wrote. “It is 
because of all of you that we 
are able to continue to do good 
work.”

proactive 
investments, 
the 

right capital decisions, a lot of 
our shared success, the provost 
has a very large component of.”

Schlissel went on to outline 

the search process for a new 
provost but, in the end, said 
Philbert 
was 
always 
the 

obvious choice.

“We actually did an open 

search,” he said. “I had no 
preconceived notion, although 
everybody was coming up to 
me with a little whisper ‘You 
know you should really just 
hire Martin’ … We did a proper 
search and we actually looked 
at outstanding candidates … 
The best talent and the best fit 
for the University of Michigan 
was already here in Martin.”

Philbert said in his remarks 

he wants to put academia 
on the forefront of national 
investment 
in 
the 
coming 

years, especially with regard 
to the Trump’s proposed $9.2 
billion budget cuts to education 
back in May. 

“It is an important time 

for us in academia,” Philbert 
said. “This is the time when 
the value of what we do, no 
matter the field, no matter the 

discipline 
or 
subdiscipline, 

truly matters in that we must 
now model to the nation both 
locally, regionally, nationally 
and across the globe, what 
it means to be driven by the 
analytic 
mind, 
by 
critical 

thought and by evidence.”

LSA senior Jad Elharake 

said he is optimistic about 
Philbert’s hire and the impact 
his new perspective will have 
on the student body. Elharake 
has been working for the 
past eight months to add a 
Middle Eastern/North African 
category as an ethnicity option 
to all University documents 
and 
forms. 
He 
had 
been 

working with Courant prior 
to Philbert’s hire and said in 
preliminary meetings, Philbert 
has been open to Elharake’s 
ideas.

“I think it’s a critical time 

here for Michigan, especially 
politically, globally and I’m just 
looking forward to the role that 
he’s going to play for students 
on campus,” Elharake said. 
“He’s kind of the go-to person 
when it comes to (this ethnicity 
addition) 
especially 
with 

figuring out the logistics of it 
and in reality, us educating him 
on the Middle Eastern/North 
African 
student 
population 

here at Michigan.”

Business 
sophomore 
Vin 

Kannan is the head of grants for 
Music Matters, an organization 
that promotes music marketing 
ventures and social change 
through music in Ann Arbor. 
He 
said 
the 
relationship 

between Philbert and Music 
Matters is aligned through 
their dedication to diversity and 
inclusion at the University. He 
also said Philbert’s comments 
on national academia relate to 
the University’s emphasis on 
real-world application.

“He seemed like he wanted 

to take pure academia and 
apply it to the world around us,” 
Kannan said. “Music Matters 
really embodies this sentiment 
by taking an entrepreneurial 
idea … and applying it to the 
real world and I think that that 
sort of action-orientated spirit 
is really my biggest takeaway 
from the new provost.”

Going forward, Philbert said 

his initiatives will take the 
University’s 
current 
budget 

into account and reflect its 
overall academic and moral 
goals.

“I’m 
certainly 
fully 

supportive of the president’s 
initiatives and we will make 
investments as we can to 
advance the mission of the 
University,” Philbert said.

announced the idea for the 
Peace Corps on the steps of the 
Michigan Union in 1960, over 
2,500 University students have 
participated. Starting this year, 
the University’s International 
Center is launching a program 
to involve even more University 
students in the Peace Corps.

“The 
Peace 
Corps 
Prep 

program will provide students 
with a foundation for Peace 
Corps 
service 
and 
other 

international opportunities by 
offering courses and activities 
in four core areas: language, 
intercultural 
competence, 

leadership and work sector,” 
according to a University press 
release from the International 

Center.

According to Kelly Nelson, 

senior 
program 
manager 

for Global Engagement and 
Education Abroad, the Peace 
Corps Prep Program is an 
initiative to give students a 
competitive edge when applying 
to the Peace Corps.

“Through the Peace Corps 

Prep program, we hope to 
help guide students who have 
interest 
in 
global 
service, 

such as the Peace Corps, to 
activities inside and outside 
of the classroom that will 
help to prepare them for these 
experiences,” Nelson wrote in 
an email interview.

International Center Director 

Judith Pennywell said in the 
press 
release 
the 
program, 

which is already in place at 
many universities around the 

country, 
will 
create 
more 

structure for students who are 
interested in the Peace Corps.

“The program’s role is to 

create a structured pathway 
for 
students 
by 
combining 

specific 
U-M 
courses 
and 

co-curricular 
experiences 
to 

build competencies Peace Corps 
has identified to be valuable,” 
Pennywell wrote.

All students with sophomore 

standing or above are eligible 
to apply, and once accepted, 
students will take classes within 
the four areas — language, 
intercultural 
competence, 

leadership and work sector — to 
earn a Peace Corps-endorsed 
certificate.

“As part of the program, 

students 
will 
complete 
two 

semesters of language courses, 
take 
three 
intercultural 

competence courses, three work 
sector-related 
courses, 
one 

leadership activity, and complete 

50 hours of field experience in 
a Peace Corps work sector,” the 

press release stated.

Though 
the 
program 
is 

tailored toward the Peace Corps, 
Nelson emphasized it teaches 
valuable skills for many careers 
and opportunities.

“Fulfilling the curricular and 

co-curricular requirements of 
the Peace Corps Prep Program 
is 
excellent 
preparation 

for 
numerous 
post-grad 

opportunities,” Nelson wrote. “I 
would also add that this program 
is especially valuable for students 
who are interested in the Peace 
Corps, but aren’t really sure how 
to go about preparing for it. The 
‘road map’ nature of this program 
takes some of the guesswork out 
of it and will hopefully make the 
Peace Corps an option for even 
more students at the University of 
Michigan.”

The 
International 
Center 

hopes many students will benefit 
from program in its inaugural 
year.

“Our goal is to attract a diverse, 

committed cadre of students 
who 
are 
passionate 
about 

global service,” Nelson wrote. 
“Because this will be our first 
year administering the program, 
we’re also looking forward to 
continuing to reflect on the 
program.”

The 
program 
is 
holding 

information sessions Sept. 15, 18 
and 30, but it’s already attracting 
students. Weinstein, who is a 
Peace Corps Ambassador on 
campus this semester, said 
she would definitely consider 
participating.

“It seems interesting,” she 

said. “Anything that sets you up 
to be more successful in your 
application is helpful.”

because he’s a veteran and he 

speaks the language,” Larson 
said. “He related to them very 
well so stuff he says resonates 
with them and he really tries 
to go where they are…it’s right 
what they need to hear.”

Fretz agreed, and explained 

how he initially intended to 
train other individuals to teach 
the course, but realized what 
an impact his own experience 
and background would have on 
his students.

“A lot of the course rests 

heavily on my style because 
I am an officer, but I can act 
enlisted, I can get by easily 
because I have the experience 
and degrees to back it up,” 
Fretz said. “For all the stuff 
in the course it’s hard to 
take the modules and hand 
it over to a well-meaning 
professor because…can you go 
to another university can you 
find someone who is a really 
proficient trainer and educator 
but is that person also a senior 
military person with all these 
deployments? Probably not.”

LSA junior Alex Downs was 

one of the student veterans 
present at the orientation. 
Downs is excited to begin his 
time at University as a transfer 
junior after serving six years in 
the U.S. Air Force.

“I always wanted to go here 

when I was a kid — I had all 
the merch — I was only going 

to apply to two other schools 
beside this one, but I figured 
there is no point because if I 
get accepted here I’m going to 
go straight here,” Downs said.

Downs 
is 
specifically 

looking forward to embracing 
the academic rigor at the 
University.

“I’m ready for the challenge 

honestly, community college 
was kind of like a walk in the 
street,” Downs said. “I could 
breeze by pretty easily but the 
last couple days have shown 
me that the stuff here is a lot 
more difficult and there is a lot 
more of it so I’m pretty happy 
about the level of academic 
challenge.”

In addition to Fretz’s course, 

another major resource to help 
student 
veterans 
with 
the 

academic challenge as well 
as the adjustment to campus 
life is PAVE. The goal of the 
program is to provide student 
veterans with peer advisors, 
often student veterans already 
on campus, who can offer 
support and guidance during 
their time at the University. 
PAVE was established by both 
the University of Michigan 
Depression Center as well as 
the Department of Psychiatry 
and 
Student 
Veterans 
of 

America.

Dylan Keyes, a peer advisor 

for 
PAVE, 
describes 
the 

importance of student veterans 
having mentors to whom they 
can relate.

“It’s really having someone 

we feel like we can connect 

with. 
It 
was 
mentioned 

yesterday 
at 
a 
different 

meeting, and we tell vets that 
if you look around and you see 
people and you don’t feel like 
you have anything in common 
— you probably don’t,” Keyes 
said. “You have a lot of vets 
that come in with a lot of 
other baggage, and it’s really 
having someone else there who 
supports them because we are a 
little more relatable just having 
that common bond from the 
past.” 

With the support of PAVE, the 

lessons from the Veteran Success 
course and other resources on 
campus such as the Veterans 
Integration 
to 
Academic 

Leadership, Fretz is pleased with 
the effort that the University has 
gone through to support student 
veterans.

“Michigan really puts their 

money where their mouth is,” 
Fretz said.

Larson hopes the Veteran 

Success 
course 
as 
well 
as 

all the other campus efforts 
provide student veterans with 
a pathway for success not only at 
the University, but also in their life 
after graduation.

“When 
they 
get 
this 

University of Michigan college 
degree they take a big step up 
on the social economic ladder. 
It’s that Spiderman line, ‘With 
great 
power 
comes 
great 

responsibility’,” Larson said. “So 
we say, ‘You’re going to have this 
kind of power with the Michigan 
degree, how are you going to use 
that again for good?’”


I

t was, by all accounts, an 
unenviable afternoon at the 
Jersey Shore. The usually 

crowded beach was sparsely 
populated, thanks in 
large part to heavy 
gray clouds, rough 
waves and a chill 
uncharacteristic 
of 

early 
August. 
My 

family and I were 
perfectly 
content, 

though. None of us 
were 
particularly 

invested in our tans 
that day. 

Several 
yards 

behind 
us 
were 

other patrons who also seemed 
to be perfectly content: A 
young couple, maybe recent 
high school graduates, was 
engaged in some heavy petting, 
to put it lightly. They were so 
affectionate that at one point 
my grandmother, who could see 
the display in her peripheral, 
commented that she had to 
keep 
reminding 
herself 
to 

look elsewhere. We shrugged 
our shoulders, chalked it up 
to young love and minded our 
own business.

A few hours later, a middle-

aged woman came over to the 
young couple from about 50 
yards away. She up-ended a bag 
of potato chips and emptied its 
contents in a circle around their 
blanket, attracting around 30 
hungry seagulls. “You want to 
hook up on the beach, this is 
what you get!”

The couple, understandably, 

was horrified. I was too, and not 
just because my grandmother is 
terrified of birds and was now 
caught in the crossfire of this 
woman’s 
misguided 
vigilante 

justice. A grown woman had 
chosen the least mature, most 
antagonistic way to handle the 
situation. What was more, some 
others were offering her mild 
applause for it.

That is why, I suppose, this 

otherwise unspectacular beach 
day stands out to me. I realize 
now that calling her a vigilante 
is a misnomer. What I saw 
from that woman and those 
who supported her stance was 
something else entirely. It was 
a real-world demonstration of a 
new, ugly category of mob justice 
— one I’d seen before, dispensed 
from the Facebook pulpit.

Before expanding on this new 

platform for populist retribution, 
one must first recognize how 
it fits into the already-worn 
commentary on the need for 

immediacy in today’s 
society. “We want X 
and we want it as fast 
as humanly possible!” 
This 
sentiment 
is 

often 
attributed 

exclusively 
to 

millennials, as if the 
only people who order 
from Amazon Prime 
and 
watch 
Netflix 

were born after 1980, 
and 
its 
discussion 

usually 
strikes 
me 

as nonsensical. But one doesn’t 
have to look far to see how our 
culture has placed a premium on 
expedited justice.

“Law & Order” never needs 

more than 45 minutes to reach a 
resolution, and “Judge Judy” gets 
it done in just 22. Not to mention 
judging panels on singing shows, 
how the “tribe has spoken” and 
the host of programs that cover 
real crime (á la “Dateline”). Even 
cooking shows are obsessed with 
the idea of a verdict.

The woman on the beach was 

no different. She felt as though 
she (or perhaps the beachgoers 
as a group) had been wronged 
and immediately sought out a 
judge, jury and executioner — 
a dramatic conclusion. Paying 
no mind to the innocence of the 
teenagers, nor to the fact that 
she had presumably completed 
elementary school and could 
therefore use her words to 
communicate, she needed to 
see the situation rectified now 
and saw herself as the only one 
fit to do so.

She was proud of her behavior, 

and likely relayed her juicy, 
dramatic story of putting those 
kids in their place to friends 
and family the next chance she 
had (she’d already reiterated 
her reasoning to half the groups 
around her). Social media users 
see and engage in this behavior 
constantly. 
Someone 
posts 

about their negative experience 
at a restaurant, a conversation 
that went south, email or text 
responses that bothered them 
(with screenshots for evidence) 
and waits for the validation in 
the comment section that what 
they did was right. As if that will 
right the wrong. As soon as a like-
minded family member, friend or 

co-worker offers a like or a few 
words of agreement, the poster 
moves on, thoroughly pleased 
with themselves.

The 
internet, 
however, 
is 

rarely (if ever) a place where 
justice is served and is much more 
prone to the obfuscation of facts, 
intense bias and echo chambers. 
Those who post do so without a 
second thought, as they did in the 
wake of the infamous “Unite the 
Right” rally in Charlottesville, 
Va., last month with Kyle Quinn. 
Mistaken for one of the neo-Nazi 
sympathizers in a picture (based 
mostly, it seems, on the fact that 
he has a beard), the assistant 
professor of engineering at the 
University of Arkansas’s face was 
plastered across the internet.

He 
was 
labeled 
a 
white 

supremacist, 
subjected 
to 

death 
threats, 
widespread 

demonization across Facebook 
and 
Twitter 
and 
ultimately 

feared for his family’s safety. 
Quinn was about 1,000 miles 
away from the protests and is not 
(to my knowledge) a racist.

Similar 
casualties 
of 
the 

Facebook pulpit can be found 
prominently in the wake of the 
Boston Marathon bombing, when 
Reddit identified not one, but 
four innocent men as the culprits 
because no one could wait for 
the authorities to do their work. 
We can see this same societal 
reflex on display when bad things 
happen to bad people and social 
media users celebrate the fact 
that cosmic justice has been 
dealt. It makes us feel as though 
the real world is a television 
series, and the villain has finally 
gotten their comeuppance.

The question that arises from 

her actions on that overcast 
afternoon in New Jersey is not 
about whether making out on a 
public beach is appropriate, nor 
is it about intervention versus 
nonintervention. The question is 
what personal sense of authority 
made that woman get up from 
her chair? What made her think 
that her actions were justified? 
And if my thesis is correct — if 
this incident was representative 
of a new brand of immediate, 
punitive and public mob justice 
that lives on and festers in social 
media — who puts the monster 
back in its box?

D

avid Foster Wallace’s 
short story anthology, 
“Girl 
with 
Curious 

Hair,” 
rested 
beneath 
my 

sunburnt face as I lay belly-
down 
beneath 
a 
volleyball 

net at the School for Field 
Studies in Rhotia, Tanzania. 
Here, even amid the shrieks 
emitted from the students-
versus-staff soccer game the 
next field over, I was met with 
a rather unfamiliar sensation: 
the ability to effortlessly follow 
a storyline. A usually slow 
reader with the tendency to 
zone out and backtrack mid-
story, I found myself whipping 
through 
Wallace’s 
satirical 

prose in personal record time, 
particularly 
enjoying 
the 

cohesiveness of his words as 
they circled my brain.

Maybe 
I 
was 
especially 

enthralled by these stories, my 
enhanced focus a product of 
elevated interest. My actual 
hypothesis, however, lies within 
the cultural manifestations of 
the Swahili phrase pole pole.

Closely translating to the 

English word “slowly,” pole pole 
is a cornerstone of Tanzanian 
lifestyle 
and, 
likewise, 
a 

breath of fresh air from the 
undying bustle of American 
culture. Mealtimes in Rhotia 
were lengthy and regarded as 
crucial, 
community-building 

social hours. Class start times 
listed on daily schedules were 
treated only as loose estimates. 
Assignment 
deadlines 
were 

spaced out evenly and fairly. 
And though almost every day 
was filled with some sort of field 
exercise or research protocol, I 
couldn’t help but feel as though 
the free time allotted to me was 
being utilized in this productive 
and streamlined way I’d never 
experienced before.

I 
avoided 
procrastination 

on homework and studying. 
I read (and finished!) books 
that held a nuanced clarity to 
me. I exercised each morning, 
indulged in every morsel of 
food on my plate (this is my 
default setting) and practiced 
slow, mindful eating while 
conversing with friends (this is 
not). I slept seven to eight hours 
per night and was attentive 
and 
engaged 
during 
field 

activities and lectures, despite 
my rash decision to test the 
waters of coffee sobriety while 
abroad. I felt both mentally and 
physically healthier than I had 
in a long while and wondered 

how my own shifting definition 
of productivity would affect the 
usual fast pace of my life back 
home.

Fast forward a couple of 

weeks to yesterday morning.

Jack Johnson’s “Inaudible 

Melodies” blared increasingly 
louder in my eardrums as I 
pumped up the volume on 
my headphones with every 
escaped ounce of focus. Slow 
down everybody, you’re moving 
too 
fast, 
Johnson 
crooned 

into my pounding ears, which 
had been forced to accept his 
“inaudible melody” as a highly 
audible one. I’ve been playing 
this song frequently since my 
arrival home from Tanzania 
as a reminder to myself to slow 
down and live a little more pole 
pole and, quite frankly, it has 
not been working.

As I pattered away on my 

laptop keys at an overpriced 
coffee 
shop 
in 
Valparaiso, 

Indiana, 
pipe 
dreams 
of 

completing two job applications 
within 
the 
hour 
swarmed 

my 
caffeine-powered 
mind. 

I had a meeting with a local 
environmental 
nonprofit 

manager 
at 
noon, 
because 

apparently the disingenuous art 
of networking was something 
in which I was now proficient. 
I had to gather my belongings 
and put my (nonexistent) spatial 
intelligence to the ultimate test 
with the dreaded back-to-school 
car-packing. I had to make my 
rounds through town to bid 
goodbye to childhood friends 
in the area. These self-induced 
deadlines settled heavily in my 
gut, and I was met again with 
the chronic stress and panic 
that promptly enters my body 
in early September and doesn’t 
leave until late April.

I didn’t get the cover letters 

done within the hour, so I 
decided to pity myself with a 
painstaking, 
45-minute-long 

scroll through my Facebook 
newsfeed. After emerging from 
this mental abyss, I realized I 
was about to return to a default 
setting of laziness disguised 
as 
productivity. 
Panicked, 

sloppy, deadline-scraping work 
reunited me with an old friend: 
intermittent mindless activity.

Watching as a man in a navy 

business suit at the corner table 
slipped into a multi-tasking 
frenzy, 
speaking 
corporate 

jargon into his Bluetooth headset 
while ferociously typing on his 
MacBook Pro, I entertained 

the notion that perhaps we are 
always disguising something 
in attempting to keep up in the 
race that is American society.

Perhaps we aren’t disguising 

it, but running from it. Is the 
hunger to push on and up in 
such an urgent and exhausting 
manner 
actually 
inhibiting 

our ability to evade a default 
laziness? What would happen 
if we flipped the paradigm 
on 
productivity, 
gauging 

“productive” action based on 
how well-balanced it leaves the 
different facets of our health? 
Though the desire to achieve 
remains an innate aspect of the 
human state, there is something 
rather inorganic about the game 
of overworking we’ve societally 
constructed for ourselves.

And yes: It feels inappropriate 

to exclusively romanticize the 
workings of other cultures 
while 
exclusively 
degrading 

this 
one. 
I 
am 
frequently 

overwhelmed by the wealth of 
opportunities available to me, 
a privilege-loaded sentiment 
deserving of gratitude. Still, as 
that familiar sense of chronic 
urgency reared its ugly head 
yesterday, I couldn’t help but 
wonder 
about 
the 
possible 

positive effects of the pole pole 
lifestyle on overall health — 
and, more specifically, on the 
health of college students.

It is no secret that college 

students 
in 
the 
United 

States, more than many other 
leading academic countries, 
face sizable rates of mental 
illness. While a 2014 article 
dubbed University of Michigan 
freshmen among the top 28 
happiest college students in 
America, I can’t help but take 
issue with the fact that such 
studies are based primarily 
off freshmen retention rates 
rather than actual health and 
wellness considerations.

Though 
I 
feel 
inevitably 

bound to get at least semi-
sucked into the fast pace of 
college life this year, I hope to 
again, for health’s sake, strike 
some version of the balance 
fostered by a lifestyle to which 
I was lucky to gain exposure 
this summer. However, I’ll 
probably need to discover a 
more 
plausible 
mechanism 

of engaging with pole pole 
than simply listening to Jack 
Johnson songs on repeat.

COURTESY OF LOLLAPALOOZA

Festival Report: Lollapalooza succeeds in surprising

As the first music festival 

I’d ever been to, Lollapalooza 
blew all my expectations out of 
the park; all that food, music, 
people and excitement, nestled 
smack dab in the middle of 
Chicago. My only regret is that 
I wasn’t able to experience 
more; I couldn’t mosh to the 
eclectic EDM at Perry’s while 
simultaneously absorbing the 
fresh new wave tracks at BMI. 
I didn’t have the funds or the 
time to try every single food 
that Chow Town offered. I 
couldn’t make it through a day 
without at least one frantic pee 
break.

The variety of performances 

and genres I was exposed to 
made me dizzy; if there’s one 
thing that I hated about Lolla, 
it’s that I simply didn’t have 
the energy to bounce through 
all four days as energized as I 
wanted to be. Grant Park itself 
was larger than I expected, and 
merely walking from one end 
of the park to the other was 

enough to tire me out. It wasn’t 
until the end of the second 
day 
that 
I 
could 
navigate 

confidently, without fear of 
being swept up by the flurry of 
people.

As I slowly climbed over 

the hill that dipped down to 
reveal the Lake Shore stage 
for the first time, my legs 
were weak with excitement. 
Hippo Campus’s chilled down 
yet still undeniably energetic 
rock welcomed me warmly. 
Even though I hadn’t listened 
to much of their discography 
beforehand, 
the 
strum 
of 

guitars and smooth, chiming 
vocals sounded exactly like a 
cooler, less angry version of the 
alternative rock I listened to in 

high school. As the sun wove 
back and forth under the angry 
grey clouds, I sat back and tried 
to enjoy what I could before the 
rain unloaded on my friends 
and me.

I arrived at the BMI stage 

just in time for the latter half of 
Gibbz’s “Bright Lights,” a song 
that’s just as mesmerizingly 
radiant as the name hints. 
“White out / Fixing all the slow 
pokes / Keeping them all ali-
i-ive,’” Gibbz sang, his voice 
rising with the short, snappy 
bite of the lyrics.

Gibbz’s 
self 
proclaimed 

“electro pop” thrums and buzzes 
with a force that is entirely 
absent 
from 
more 
acoustic 

genres. A cocktail of solid, 
weighty bass, sharp buzzing 
chords and gliding electronic 
tones result in a smooth yet 
refreshing 
performance. 

The combination of Gibbz’s 
easygoing personality and the 
relatively older audience made 
me feel like I was at a low key 
outdoor concert rather than at 
a music festival.

From the get go, I liked 

the 
BMI 
stage 
more 
than 

any of the other stages I’d 
sampled. The smaller venue 
meant performances felt more 
exclusive. Rather than having 
one artist scream at hundreds, if 
not thousands of festivalgoers, 
there was only room for so 
many people, and the best part 
of a smaller crowd is that nearly 
everyone has a clear view of the 
performer.

Gibbz played a few more of 

his trademark tracks, including 
the 
smooth 
and 
suggestive 

“Stay for a While.” His set 
ended far too soon.

After scarfing down some of 

the best chicken tenders I’ve 
ever had (courtesy of Harold’s 
Chicken) 
and 
taking 
an 

impromptu nap under the trees 
by the food stands, I headed to 
the Bud Light stage for some 
good old fashioned waiting.

I don’t like hip hop. If Lorde 

weren’t 
playing 
after 
Wiz 

Khalifa, I wouldn’t have even 
gone to his set; for much of the 
festival, my tactic was to avoid 
the huge, super popular artists 
simply because it was such a 
pain to get anywhere near the 
stage. But for Lorde? I’d suffer 
through the mosh pit. Heck, I’d 
suffer through the mosh pit to 
end all mosh pits.

Wiz sauntered out to the 

maniacal screams of hundreds 
of fans, lit up by the diffused 
glow of the afternoon sun as it 
shone through the cloudy haze 
that hovered over the crowd. 
The 
bright, 
rambunctious 

energy was difficult to ignore, 
even for me. As “Bake Sale” 
boomed over heads and into 
hearts, 
Wiz 
bounced 
on 

his heels, adjusted his oval 
sunglasses and smirked.

Halfway into his set, Wiz 

brought out Ty Dolla Sign for 
“Paranoid,” an entrance that 
was punctuated by a person 
next to me turning around and 
exclaiming “Ty Dolla Sign? 
That man sure can sing!”

The end of Wiz’s set was 

accompanied by frantic Lorde 
fans pushing towards the stage 
and the first faint raindrops of 
doom. As the wait ticked away, 
the rain fell harder and harder, 
until all hope of staying dry 
was lost. Some people huddled 
together underneath a rain 
poncho. Others faced the water 
head on, unblinking even as it 
turned the ground underfoot 
to sticky mud. It was for Lorde! 
‘Twas all for Lorde!

We waited almost an entire 

hour 
longer 
than 
planned, 

and it was one of the most 
excruciating hours of my life. 
Anticipation grew as the sun 
finally set, the sky darkening 
overhead.

A splash of red. A blur in 

the shadows. When the lights 
finally shone, we screamed. 
Lorde’s 
movements 
were 

assuredly confident, her eyes 
shiny and she was every bit the 
icon her music made her out to 
be. She launched straight into 
“Green Light,” her voice tense 
with emotion as violins rang 
clear in the background. Just as 
she made it to where the build 
begins, right before the chorus, 
the lights dimmed again and 
she stopped.

Over? Already? No way.
Don’t you think that it’s 

boring how people talk?

And we were back at it — 

people were ecstatic that our 
Lorde and Savior was playing 
her old songs. While Lorde 
swayed, danced, and performed 
her heart out right in front of us, 
a dancer in a glass box moved 
behind 
her, 
illuminated 
by 

blue light. Although the stage 
provided some shelter from 
the rain, the water bounced 
off the smooth surfaces of the 
equipment and the stage floor 
itself. With every pass Lorde 
made across the stage, the mist 
soaked her until she began 
to resemble the soggy fans 
clamoring beneath her. She’s 
human, after all.

When Lorde finally paused 

to greet everyone, it was with 
the same quirky flair she’s 
famous for: “It’s weird. We’ve 
been 
getting 
this 
fucking 

crazy weather wherever we 
go — wind, thunder, lightning, 
rain. And I like to think, 
Lollapalooza, it’s because you 
and I, tonight, we’re gonna 
conjure the spirits.”

We shivered and crowed. 

The entire performance was 
otherworldly, as if Lorde had 
teleported the crowd to another 
dimension meant just for us. But 
as she went to perform a song 
that had never been performed 
live, the worst possible thing 
happened; the festival got shut 
down. While I understood the 
reasoning behind the decision, 
a small part of me couldn’t help 
but stew at how unfair it felt.

The crowd waited around 

for a few more minutes until it 
became obvious there was no 
way Lorde was coming back 
out. As I trudged toward the 
exit, muddy rainwater soaking 
my socks, I’m just grateful to 
have seen Lorde at all.

Day two is for exploring. 

Now that I’ve had my first taste 
of Lolla’s various offerings, my 
friends persuade me to widen 
my horizons further. As I’m 
dragged to the Perry’s stage, 
which is in the middle of San 
Holo’s set, I’m apprehensive but 
also excited.

Hardcore 
EDM 
fans 
are 

likely intimately familiar with 
the specific styles and nuances 
that differentiate EDM artists, 
but to me, all of them sounded 
pretty much the same; the 
flashing, blinding lights, the 
spine shaking, quivering chords 
and bubbles of bright, exploding 
sound. When I screamed, I 
couldn’t hear my own voice, but 
that’s the appeal, isn’t it?

Perry’s is not for the faint 

of heart. But if you can look 
past the miasma of sound and 
stimulation, 
the 
energy 
is 

absolutely unparalleled.

After a few hours of EDM, 

I’m wilting again. Another trip 
to the food stands for a tasty box 
of Mad Social’s poutine leaves 
me refreshed and energized 
for 
Missio’s 
performance. 

The duo, which consists of 
vocalist Matthew Brue and 
instrumentalist David Butler, 
are known for their fresh take 
on punchy, intense electronica. 
At the BMI stage, tracks from 
their debut album Loner fill 
the air with a dark, tumultuous 
ambience.

In a later interview, Missio 

and 
I 
talked 
about 
their 

songwriting process and their 
hopes for the future.

“I was in love with Tool 

and heavy bands [when I was 
younger], and I think the way 
we just mangle it all — almost 
as if if an electronic band 
was grunge — I think that’s 
why it comes out sounding 
like that,” Butler said. “It’s 
been 
interesting 
because 

we never really thought of 
ourselves as a rock band, but 
we connected with a lot of rock 
crowds because there’s a lot of 
aggression and attitude in what 
we’re talking about, but there’s 
also aggressiveness in the way 
the sound is produced, which 
comes from our roots.”

Missio’s 
discography 

encompasses a huge variety 
of soundscapes, such as the 
difference in tone and emotion 
between the vengeful, intense 
“Everybody Gets High” and 
the cooler, more even tempered 
“Bottom of the Deep Blue Sea.” 
Part of that variety is due to the 
unique inspirations that Brue 
and Butler gravitate towards.

“I think from a melody 

standpoint, I get a lot of 
inspiration 
from 
different 

modern folk singers,” Bruce 
said. “For some reason, those 
melodies have been ingrained 
into me since an early age, 
so 
bringing 
them 
into 
an 

aggressive pop context is just 
different from what I think 
people are used to normally 
hearing.”

The variety in tracks is 

also due to the duo’s relaxed 
songwriting process. Rather 
than trying to reach a goal track 
number, they let songs develop 

organically.

“We don’t go into a writing 

process or a writing day or go 
‘I think we need to write a song 
like this.’ It depends on how 
we’re feeling and lyrically what 
we want to talk about, whether 
we’re in a mellow mood or not,” 
Bruce said. “It’s just, let’s write 
as many songs as possible—let’s 
write a song today cause we’re 
songwriters and we have to do 
that, and whatever comes out 
comes out.”

For now, Missio is focused 

on staying true to the mission 
that the group was founded 
on: creative progression and a 
commitment to genuine music.

“To have fans that resonate 

with us emotionally, that will 
grow with us emotionally and 
listen to what we have to say is 
the dream for every musician,” 
Butler said. “To just be heard, 
you know. That’s the journey.”

Day three started off quite 

a bit later than I had planned. 
While my friends had wanted 
to see Aminé, we ended up 
stuck in the bag line for two 
hours, completely missing his 
1:50 performance. A tip for new 
festivalgoers — when possible, 
leave your bag behind, or make 
sure to get inside before the 
early afternoon rush.

We made it to the Pepsi 

stage just as The Japanese 
House started their set. Solo 
artist Amber Bain’s melodious, 
uniquely relaxing, delicately 
produced tracks are especially 
otherworldly under the shade 
of the trees that circled the 
stage. For a while, it felt like I 
was 
submerged 
underwater, 

listening to the harmonies of 
“Clean” from beneath a layer of 
shimmering, undulating waves.

As 
the 
heat 
grew 

suffocatingly sticky, I went 
to go see Glass Animals at the 
Grant Park stage. A full hour 
in advance and the area was 
already packed with sweating 
bodies, some of which were 
probably waiting for Chance’s 
performance at the same place 
later that night.

Like 
many 
other 
artists, 

Glass 
Animals 
doesn’t 
fit 

perfectly into any one musical 
genre, 
but 
they’re 
one 
of 

few bands that have a truly 
distinctive, psychedelic sound. 
Hearing 
the 
bittersweet 

sadness and interspersed beats 
of “The Other Side of Paradise” 
performed live was absolutely 
enthralling in and of itself, but 
combined with lead vocalist 
Dave 
Bayley’s 
zany 
dance 

moves, the experience was 
downright extraordinary.

Glass 
Animals 
performed 

songs off of both Zaba and How 
to Be a Human Being while a 
humongous golden pineapple 
rotated slowly behind them. 
They ended their show with 
“Pork Soda,” a peppy, fittingly 
pineapple related track.

Rather than stay for the 

hordes waiting to see Chance, I 
decided to turn in early for the 
night.

Day four started out both 

bright and sad. With a late start 
to the day and a mid afternoon 

bus to catch, I only really had 
time to see one artist, so I went 
to the Grant Park stage for the 
final time.

The 
thing 
about 
Maggie 

Rogers is her joy. It’s evident in 
everything she does.

When she ran out onto the 

stage, a glittery red blur, she 
was smiling so hard that the 
entire crowd could feel that joy. 
After waving a few times with 
both hands, she settled into the 
smooth, mellow tones of “Color 
Song,” the first track off of her 
EP. The understated poetry of 
the lyrics combined with the 
dragonflies that hovered right 
above our heads was idyllic.

Rogers has some of the best 

qualities that a performer can 
have. She’s both humble and 
proud, acutely aware both of 
the places she’s been and of the 
ways she’s grown: “This is my 
first summer playing festivals, 
and it’s been amazing. I’ve 
gotten to travel all over the 
world, and it feels so good to 
finally be at home,” Rogers said 

during a pause between songs.

As a new performer, Rogers 

is a breath of cheerful fresh 
air among fellow rising stars. 
She played every single track 
off of her EP and a few oldies 
from her days as a student 
at NYU, and even joked that 
“The problem with only having 
one EP out is that you don’t 
actually have enough songs 
to fill an hour long set,” while 
smiling luminously. Her bubbly 
personality didn’t waver once 
during her show.

More than anything, Lolla 

took the predictability out of 
regular musical performances. 
The variety of artists meant 
you could walk in with a plan 
but walk out having seen a 
completely 
different 
set 
of 

artists. 
Perhaps 
even 
more 

importantly, 
every 
single 

person I met in Grant Park was 
absolutely thrilled to be there, 
from the musicians themselves 
to the people helping out at the 
Camelbak Hydration Stations. 
When I left, scanning my 
wristband for the last time, it 
was with the certainty that I 
would return to Grant Park’s 
green pastures once more. With 
so many lifelong memories 
made in so little time, how 
could I resist?

CONCERT REVIEW


FOCUS FEATURES

Bewildered, not ‘Beguiled’

This 
summer 
saw 
more 

of 
the 
academic-discourse-

permeates-pop-culture 
phenomenon 
that’s 
been 

snowballing for the past few 
years, 
especially 
on 
social 

media; one of the most obvious 
examples of how polarizing 
it can get was the discourse 
surrounding Sofia Coppola’s 
reboot of “The Beguiled.” And 
yes, I’m still thinking about it 
several months after the fact — 
now that the dust has settled 
(and I’ve wasted even more 
of my time reading frenetic 
think pieces) I have a more 
synthesized idea of why I had 
such a hard time articulating 
my irritation with both the 
film’s critics and champions.

“Beguiled” made Coppola 

the second woman ever to 
win 
best 
director 
at 
the 

Cannes 
Film 
Festival, 
and 

several people praised it as the 
feminist reboot we’ve all been 
waiting for. Others completely 
panned it. Always a sucker 
for a period piece stirring up 
contention, I walked into the 
theatre intrigued.

I 
walked 
out 
utterly 

bemused. 
Maybe 
my 

experience was ruined because 
my roommate could not stop 
giggling for the last 45 minutes 
straight. Or maybe she was 
right, and I need to look at it 
purely as if it were played for 
camp — but based on how many 
people thought it was either 
the feminist film of the year or 
the worst decision Cannes ever 
made, I don’t think so.

Coppola’s “Beguiled” takes 

us into the small world of a 
group of young women at an 
all-girls boarding school in the 
South during the Civil War. 
Within the first few moments 
of the film, one of the youngest 
of the girls stumbles upon an 
injured Union deserter, Cpl. 
John McBurney (Colin Farrell, 
“The Lobster”) and brings 
him home with her to tend to 
his wounded leg. Most of the 
girls and young women are 
fascinated with him, a couple 
of the younger ones nursing 
crushes while the oldest girl, 
Edwina (Kristen Dunst, “The 
Virgin Suicides”) appears to 
fall in love, and Alicia (Elle 
Fanning) appears to be in the 
throes of a sexual awakening. 
Both of their efforts are shut 
down 
by 
Martha 
(Nicole 

Kidman) who is also more 
interested in the soldier than 
she lets on.

There 
are 
two 
reasons, 

as far as I could tell, why 
people hailed it as one of the 
feminist films of the year. 
For one, Coppola turns the 
ending of the original slightly 
on its head, infusing it with 
a little more confusion and a 
little more castration revenge 
fantasy; the women might have 
the power, the film whispers 
at you to believe. For another 
thing, it portrays these young 
women to have a little more 
sexual 
agency 
than 
the 

original. More so-called sexual 
empowerment.

Many of the loudest critics 

of the film came at it from 
a social perspective, rather 
than a cinematic or aesthetic 
one. Many scorned the idea 
that this film chose to omit 
the one character of color that 
was in the original, arguing 
that it made no sense for 
a film about this period to 
have no characters of color, 
particularly 
slaves 
— 
this 

particular criticism has been 
responded to by those who 
argue that including a person 
of color only as a tokenized 
bearer of trauma would have 
signified 
more 
harm 
than 

good.

There is absolutely valid 

criticism 
of 
the 
Southern 

Gothic genre, as well as any 
Civil War period piece that 
could miss the mark. But “The 
Beguiled” is not “Gone with the 
Wind”; that is, it is not using 
the Civil War as an aesthetic 
backdrop to tell a different, 
romanticized story. Rather, it is 
— or shall I say, could have been 
— a microcosmic portrayal of a 
very particular group of people 
during this era. It actually 
wouldn’t be that unlikely for 
slaves to have run off from a 
property close to the end of 
the Civil War, especially if it 
was an estate without a white 
man in charge, such as this 
one. I have read about cases 
where white women in charge 
of plantations had freed slaves 
for no other reason than they 
were scared of rebellion. So the 

overall premise that these six 
young white women in this all-
women’s school would be alone 
and doing their own work isn’t 
far off the mark.

Now don’t get me wrong, 

I 
love 
the 
fulfillment 
of 

castration fantasies as much 
as the next girl, and I get 
the burning desire (no pun 
intended) to show beyond all 
measure that women, even 
young women, also feel sexual 
desire and had the agency in 
some ways to act on that, even 
in the era of the eyelash batting 
Southern belles. I understand 
the appeal of the character of 
Alicia. But that in itself, even 
if it were believable, wouldn’t 
be nearly enough to give 
validation to the idea that this 
film is feminist. Because at the 
end of the day, two, if not three, 
of the main women in the film 
are ready to throw each other 
under the bus, desperate and 
competitive to the point of 
comicality for his approval and 
attention.

This 
film 
isn’t 
feminist 

because it lacks completely 
the grounding that a true 
examination of these women’s 
relationships with each other 
would’ve looked like. Being 
alone for months, if not years, 
terrified every time Union 
or 
Confederate 
men 
came 

by, would likely have bonded 
them so closely together it 
would be nearly impossible 
for anyone to come between 
any two of them, let alone all. 
These women completely lose 
their heads over a man; some 
small sliver of so-called sexual 
agency is not nearly enough to 
gloss over that.

There 
is 
plenty 
to 

enjoy 
about 
“Beguiled”: 

Aesthetically, 
it’s 
gorgeous. 

But a reboot of a film isn’t 
feminist just because it’s less 
misogynistic than its original 
source material, or because 
it includes a weak attempt 
at sexual empowerment that 
honestly only caters to the 
men — both the man in the 
film and the male reviewers 
who think themselves open-
minded for praising it as some 
kind of feminist empower-trip. 
And there’s plenty to criticize 
too; but criticism of the film 
itself as a story based on the 
historical aspects of it only 
really works if it is predicated 
upon 
accuracy, 
not 
value 

judgements.

SINGLE REVIEW

Annie Clark is now bicoast-
aly melancholic. Earlier this 
week, the singer, who pre-
forms under the name “St. 
Vincent,” released the sec-
ond single off Masseducation 
— which now has an Oct. 13 
release day.

“Los Ageless” is, in many 
ways, a companion track 
to the album’s first single, 
“New York.” The title is, of 
course, a riff on Los Ange-
les. Both are love songs and 
lamentations, but while the 
former deals with a love lost, 
the latter contents with a 
love never fully formed. “I 
try to tell you I love and it 
comes out all sick,” she sings 
at the end of the song.

Her relationship with the 
city is as vivid as it is compli-

cated. The city is drawn like 
an abusive lover, but she’s 
trapped there, lured in by 
the sparkle and the sunsets 
and the superstars. The sec-
ond verse paints images like 
“Girls in cages playing their 
guitars” and “In Los Ageless, 
the waves they never break 
/ They build and build until 
you don’t have no escape.”

Off the heals of Melodrama, 
producer Jack Antonoff and 
his signature sound are hav-
ing a moment in pop music. 
After “Look What You Made 
Me Do” earlier this month, I 
thought his punchy bassline 

and hand clap prechoruses 
were six feet under. But, it 
turns out Taylor Swift is 
dead and Jack Antonoff isn’t 
going anywhere. The sticky 
synth and twacking bassline 
pull the best of ’80s pop, 
while St. Vincent’s deep, 
smoky vocals feel acutely 
current.

The chorus is haunting — 
“How could anybody have 
you and lose you?” — she 
begs again and again. It is, 
in true St. Vincent fashion, 
everything that good pop 
music aspires to be. I can’t 
get it out of my head. It’s 
simple and infectious and, 
yet, I haven’t completely fig-
ured it out yet.

The Michigan football team’s season opener lived up to the hype, 
as the Wolverines defeated then-No. 17 Florida, 33-17. Next up is 
a Cincinnati team that struggled mightily against Austin Peay in 
its season opener. The Bearcats figure to be another tune-up for a 
Michigan team entering the easiest part of its schedule. It would 
take more than a few breaks to put Cincinnati in contention.

The Daily breaks down how the 
Wolverines will fare against the Bearcats.

Florida (Sept. 2): ***Jaws theme song***

Cincinnati (Sept. 9): What even is a bearcat? A 
bear? A cat? Why not a catbear?

Penn State (Oct. 21): *Types...deletes...

Rutgers (Oct. 28): If you’re reading this from 
the hot tub in the student section at Rutgers, 
you should go to the doctor.

Minnesota (Nov. 5): PJ.. Fleck-Harbaugh is the 
next Mayweather-McGregor.

Air Force (Sept. 16): Air Force was my safety 
school. (But really thank you for your service.)

Maryland (Nov. 11): You don’t live in D.C., stop 
saying that.

Purdue (Sept. 23): This game should be a 
*clears throat* STREET FIGHT BETWEEN THE 
WHISTLES!

Michigan State (Oct. 7): The Michigan Daily 
has beaten the State News 12 years in a row.

Indiana (Oct. 14): Hoosier? I barely know her.
Ohio State (Nov. 25): We finally found some-

Behind Enemy Lines: A conversation 
with Cincinnati’s football beat writer

By BETELHEM ASHAME

Managing Sports Editor

To gain an inside perspective 

on the Cincinnati football team, 
the Daily reached out to our 
counterparts at The News Record, 
the student-run newspaper at 
the University of Cincinnati. On 
Thursday, we spoke on the phone 
with Jason Szelest — the sports 
editor at The News Record — to 
talk about the upcoming game 
between No. 8 Michigan and the 
Bearcats.

Here’s 
a 

look into our 
conversation:

The 

Michigan 
Daily: 
What 

was 
the 

immediate 
reaction 
over 

there 
after 

playing a team 
like Austin Peay 
pretty close in 
that opener?

The 
News 

Record: I’d say the immediate 
reaction 
was 
disappointment. 

When you look at what we had 
last year — last year was a very 
disappointing season for us. Lot 
of high expectations that were 
not even close to met, finished 
with a 4-8 record and really 
just looked listless throughout 
most of the season. I think a lot 
of people were thinking that 
(former 
head 
coach) 
Tommy 

Tuberville was the problem and 
then, while no one was expecting 
(current head coach Luke) Fickell 
to take us 12-0 in his first season, 
they were expecting to see some 
sort of improvement; and I really 
don’t think that anyone saw 
improvement in what we put out 
there last Thursday.

TMD: Is there something in 

particular from your perspective 
that went wrong against them 
in the opener. Was it an energy 
thing?

TNR: Oh, I absolutely think 

it was an energy thing. I mean, 
we don’t have the most talented 
roster, but we have a roster good 
enough to put a team like Austin 
Peay — who I believe has lost 28 

straight games at the FCS level 
— we had enough talent that 
we should have put them away 
early and then never let off the 
gas pedal. I believe defensively 
we gave up almost 200 yards 
rushing and offensively we didn’t 
get a push, and that’s not a talent 
thing, that’s an effort thing. And I 
don’t think that we really had the 
energy and enthusiasm needed to 
play a college football game, and I 
think a lot of that was because of 
the fact that we were looking at a 
team that we knew wasn’t going 
to be too good and thought we 
could just coast by.

TMD: So coming into Michigan 

— Michigan just jumped to (No. 8) 
— I saw that quote in your story, 
the “shock the world” quote, is 
that a soundbite or is that the 
general feeling you’re getting 
around their facilities, that they 
actually are confident coming 
into this one?

TNR: It’s hard to say ‘cause, 

when you look at someone like 
Luke Fickell — I think he’s a 
very confident coach in general 
— obviously he has had success 
against Michigan in the past. He 
knows that he doesn’t have the 
roster that he had at Ohio State, 
obviously, but I think he wants 
to put across the mentality that it 
doesn’t matter who UC is playing. 
He said it multiple times. He 
doesn’t care who the opponent 
is, he’s worried about what UC 
does, and I feel that he believes 
it, to some degree at least. That if 
we do what we need to do, we can 
still come away successful.

TMD: So in order to pull off 

the upset, what is one thing that 
you think Cincinnati really needs 
to lock down on?

TNR: No question about it. I’d 

say there’s two things: running 
game and running defense. If 
our run defense performs the 
way they did against Austin 
Peay, Michigan will run for 
500 yards on us. The way that 
Michigan’s offense is designed, 
with a power running game like 
that, we have got to stop that. We 
have got to make (redshirt junior 
quarterback 
Wilton) 
Speight 

throw the ball. That is our only 
chance at victory. Speight, I still 

say, is a decent quarterback, but 
I’d much rather put the ball in 
his hands than have to deal with 
Michigan’s running game the 
entire time. Offensively, (running 
back) Mike Boone is our most 
talented player, hands down. 
On the entire team, he’s the guy 
that has to be a playmaker. I 
would be absolutely shocked if 
we were able to just power down 
Michigan’s throat, through the 
tackles, so I think we need to 
come up with more dynamic 
ways of getting him involved in 
the offense. I think maybe lining 
him up in the slot a little bit, just 
trying to get him on the edge 
and get some perimeter blocking 
going because we are not going 
to just shove it down Michigan’s 
throat every play and get four or 
five yards a carry. That’s just not 
going to happen.

TMD: 
I’m 
curious 
about 

Hayden Moore. I want to say now 
he has two years of starting under 
his belt, am I wrong there?

TNR: Sort of two years. His 

freshman season, he came in for 
an injured Gunner Kiel and kind 
of took over. Then obviously 
Gunner had a situation where he 
left the program before the bowl 
game and then Hayden Moore 
started. Gunner had sort of come 
back and taken the job over again 
when he got healthy, but when he 
left the program, Hayden Moore 
got to start the bowl game as well 
his freshman year. So I’d say he 
started maybe six, seven games 
his freshman year. Last year, 
Hayden Moore was named the 
starter at the beginning of the 
season and he played throughout 
the majority of the start of the 
year then got hurt. When he 
came back, he wasn’t really all 
that effective and he was kind 
of battling between Gunner Kiel 
and Ross Trail for the starting 
position later on in the year. So he 
has started games in two years, 
but he’s never had a full season 
where he’s started every game.

TMD: Either way, that’s a 

collection of experience that he 

has going against a Michigan 
secondary that, for the most 
part, doesn’t really have any, 
so is he the type of player that 
can be an X-factor or is he the 
type of quarterback that will be 
serviceable?

TNR: 
Honestly, 
that’s 
the 

question a lot of UC fans ask 
because the first game Hayden 
Moore ever played was against 
Memphis when Gunner Kiel went 
down. As a freshman — never 
playing a snap of college football in 
his life — in about three quarters, 
he threw for 550 yards and five 
touchdowns 
against 
Memphis. 

Though he can be that playmaker, 
the X-factor, the bottom line is, 
since that time, it seems like he’s 
more concerned about making 
mistakes and not just being that 
player that I think he can be. So at 
this point in his career, I’m more 
concerned with Hayden Moore 
being serviceable and not turning 
the ball over against Michigan

SAM MOUSIGIAN/Daily

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh will coach against former Ohio State defensive coordinator Luke Fickell on Saturday.


IN COACH’S OFFICE

Ted Janes, Daily Sports Writer

In December, Mason 

Cole had a chance 
to leave for the NFL 

Draft. Now, he’s 

Michigan’s captain.

Mason Cole, all 6-foot-5 of him, sat 
down in his coach’s office.
Beside him was his dad, John, 
who had flown up to Ann Arbor 
from Tampa, and sitting across 
the room at his desk was offensive 
coordinator 
Tim 
Drevno. 
But 

the maestro in the room, Jim 
Harbaugh, was standing, pacing 
around. Harbaugh, still wearing his 
football cleats and dressed in the 
vintage Harbaugh look, eventually 
sat down, but only for 10 seconds 
before getting up again to pace back 

and forth.
The 
four 
gathered 
to 
discuss 

Mason’s future. It was Dec. 23rd, 
2016, just a couple days before 
Christmas, 
and 
Schembechler 

Hall was bustling. 
Staff ran around 
in 
preparation 

for the upcoming 
bowl 
game 
in 

Miami. 
Recruits 

were visiting the 
building 
for 
the 

first time. Mason 
and John felt lucky 
to 
get 
Harbaugh 

alone, even if it was 
for only an hour.
The meeting was important though 
— Mason’s father wouldn’t have 
made the trip if it weren’t. Should 
he go pro? Mason, always even-
tempered, wasn’t sure how serious 

he was about leaving college early 
to go to the NFL Draft. There was 
a lot going well for him in Ann 
Arbor. But it was the NFL; he had 
to consider it.

On their own time, 
Mason 
and 
his 

parents had laid out 
their 
own 
versions 

of the pros and cons. 
At first, John figured 
they should just have 
the conversation over 
a 
conference 
call, 

but he later changed 
his mind. He doesn’t 
get 
to 
meet 
with 

Harbaugh 
face-to-

face very often, and after all — John 
thought — who better for advice 
about going pro than someone who 
had coached in a Super Bowl?
So John flew up to see Mason and 

meet with the coaches. The trip 
would be short, but it was well 
worth it.
“If you guys want to go (into the 
NFL Draft), we’ll support you a 
hundred percent,” John remembers 
Harbaugh saying in the meeting. 
“We’ll do all we can through 
the contacts we have to help the 
process.”

***

And so the four talked. They talked 
about Mason’s age, his size and 
what position he would play going 
forward.
Mason’s junior season had just 
finished, and like every season 
dating back all the way to his 
freshman year of high school, he 
had started every game. In 2016, he 
played center. He had played left 
tackle for the two years before, but 
his coaches envisioned he would 

play inside whenever he moved to 
the NFL.
If Michigan needed him to, Mason 
would’ve moved to play anywhere 
on the offensive line.
“I think if you asked Mason, he’d 
play wide receiver if he thought it 
would help us win,” said Michigan 
tackles coach Greg Frey.
Mason’s talent was undeniable. 
For three straight years, he had 
been the Wolverines’ most reliable 
player. The former coaching staff 
under Brady Hoke saw it from the 
beginning.
In mid-August of 2014, there had 
been hints and signs that Mason, 
a true freshman at the time, might 
get serious playing time. He’d been 
practicing well and rotating with 
the expected starters, and toward 
the end of fall camp, he finally got 
the nod. Soon after, he called his

Senior center Mason Cole had the opportunity to leave Ann Arbor for the NFL Draft toward the end of 2016, but chose to stay at Michigan. Now, he’ll be the offensive captain for the Wolverines’ home opener.

“He was special 
in high school. 
... He had it, and 

he has it.”


parents to tell them the news.
Mason’s parents, John and Maggie, 
were at a business conference in 
Banff, Alberta when they found out 
their son was going to start. They 
had promised him that if he were 
starting, they would go to every 
game. They just didn’t know it was 
going to happen that quickly.
Against 
Appalachian 
State 
in 

September 
2014, 
Mason 
Cole 

became 
the 
first-ever 
true 

freshman at Michigan to start a 
season opener on the offensive line.
He was just plain good, and his 
coaches knew it. They couldn’t 
describe what made him better 
than the next guy, he just was.
Frey saw his potential from an 
early age. He recruited Mason 
when he was coaching at Indiana, 
and still remembers the day Mason 
turned down an offer to play for the 
Hoosiers. 
“He was special in high school,” 
Frey said. “When you went and 
watched him practice, there was 
something different. They call it 
the ‘it factor’ or whatever. He had 
it, and he has it.”
Perhaps it was his dependability 
— 
nobody 
could 
play 
more 

consistently. Harbaugh has said 
that Mason is a “standout” at all 
times. Mason’s dad called him a 
“Steady Eddie.”
It was one the reasons he was able 
to consider going pro.

***

At the meeting in Drevno’s office, 
they talked about Mason’s goals 
and how he would fit in in the NFL.
Mason was younger than a lot of 
the others entering the draft. He 
had never redshirted a season, and 
despite all of his experience, he was 
still young — just 20 years old at the 
time.
Another 
year 
under 
Harbaugh 

would add to his résumé, and 
staying for a fourth season could 
substantially help his career. After 
his junior year, he was projected 
to get drafted somewhere between 
the second and fourth rounds. With 
another season, he could maybe 
sneak into the first.
The NFL and all its money were 
attractive, but playing on the 
biggest stage as soon as possible 
didn’t matter to him. He didn’t 
want to pass up on the chance to 
graduate from school, a lesson he 
learned from his dad.
John’s 
mother 
— 
Mason’s 

grandmother — was the oldest of 
13 kids. Growing up, John had lots 
of extended family, but he was the 
first one to graduate from college. 
During John’s senior year of high 
school, his dad encouraged him to 
continue pursuing his education.
“You gotta go at least one year to try 
it,” he recalls his father saying.
Then John asked his father who 
was going to pay for college.
“Well, you are,” his father replied.

So he did. John enrolled at Northern 
Illinois, and worked each summer 
to make enough money to cover 
tuition. While his friends were out 
doing other things, John spent long 
summer hours hauling furniture 
for a moving company in Chicago. 
He earned his way through college, 
and moved forward in the business 
world. Six years after Mason was 
born, the Cole family moved south 
from Batavia, Ill. to Tarpon Springs, 
Fla. John and Maggie raised three 
kids, and Mason always noticed the 
hard work his parents were putting 
in.
Every day in high school, Mason 
woke up at 6:00 a.m. His dad would 
be up at the same time to get to 
work, and his mom would always 
have breakfast ready. After school, 
he’d go to football practice, and 
when that ended he would come 
home to another cooked meal from 
his mom. Mason had the whole 
house to himself, as his two older 
siblings had gone away to college 
while he was at East Lake High 
School.
“Golden child,” Mason says with 
a laugh. “Dinner would always be 
ready, and Mom would be the first 
one to put all my football laundry 
in the washer to get it ready for the 
next day.”
As he describes it, he was just 
like 
any 
other 
kid. 
He 
liked 

hanging out with his friends in 
the neighborhood, riding his bike 
around town and going to the 
beach. In the summer, he worked on 
the docks at the Homeport Marina 
in Palm Harbor, tying up boats and 
refueling tanks. He’d always come 
home with a pocket full of singles 
from the tips he had made.
And every fall Friday before a 
football game, his mom picked 
up the same turkey sub sandwich 
from the supermarket and brought 
it to him for lunch. It was a steady 
routine, and nothing too out of 
the ordinary, but it was just what 
Mason wanted.
He was a humble, hard-working 
kid, and it made him good at his job.
Whether he was paying for college 
by playing football — which he 
ended up doing — or paying for it 
through another job like his dad, 
he wanted to earn his way through 
life. He wanted to make his parents 
proud.

***

In Drevno’s office, Harbaugh sat 
down. Then he got back up. They 
talked about what Mason could do, 
and what he already had done, for 
the team.
With 37 consecutive starts over 
three years, Mason’s impact on 
Michigan football was easy to 
grasp. He was a two-time All-Big 
Ten honoree, with a second team 
award in 2016 and an honorable 
mention in 2015.
To start a true freshman at left 

tackle in the season opener sounded 
crazy, but with Mason it seemed 
like nothing short of necessary. 
Guarding the quarterback’s blind 
side is one of the most important 
roles on the field, but he established 
himself as the frontrunner from the 
moment he arrived.
He impressed the coaching staff 
with his abilities on the field, and 
his teammates took a liking to him 
as well.
He became close with the fellow 
Brady Hoke-holdovers like Patrick 
Kugler, Wilton Speight and Henry 
Poggi — guys that stuck with the 
program even when the team was 
losing. 
They’d 
fought 
together 

through 
the 
hard 
times 
their 

freshman year when the team went 
5-7, when their coach was fired and 
when they really asked themselves, 
‘How are we ever gonna be good?’
But those struggles brought them 
closer, and it motivated them. The 
program had been through so much 
in the time between his official 
recruiting visit and the meeting 
in Drevno’s office, but he never 
doubted it was right the place for 
him.
‘You should choose a school for the 
school’, Mason’s high school coach 
used to tell him. Regardless of who 
the coach was or would be, Mason 
felt like he was in a great place.
As he grew older, his coaches 
expected him to cultivate and 
sustain the environment he loved 
so much. 
Mason would host recruits when 
they came to visit. When offensive 
linemen Nolan Ulizio and Ben 
Bredeson arrived on each of their 
official visits, it was Mason’s 
responsibility to make sure they 
would want to return.
“Two-for-two on those,” Mason 
laughs.
The trust among Mason, his 
coaches and his teammates 
continued 
to 
grow. 
He 

developed as a mentor, and 
his whole team understood 
how big of an impact he 
was making.
Poggi 
once 
said 
that 

Mason was “so special 
for our program.”
Ulizio 
added: 

“Anything I need help 
with, I just go up to 
Mason and ask for 
advice.”
Mason was reliable off 
of the football field — 
just as much as he was 
on it.

***

And in Drevno’s office, they talked 
about making Mason a captain.
The coaches couldn’t guarantee 
it. Michigan football captains are 
elected by their teammates, but 
they gave him their full support. 
They all knew that Mason was next 
in line for the position, and the 

coaches told him that during the 
meeting.
Mason never tried to become 
a leader. He just did. With his 
success in high school and college, 
the role just came to him. At first, 
John and Mason weren’t sure they 
understood what being a captain 
entailed.
“I play offensive line. It’s not really 
a spotlight position to begin with,” 
Mason said. “But I think that’s one 
of the ways to be successful.”
Mason had made a career by staying 
under the radar. He made the right 
choices and never complained. He 
always kept 
a 
cool 

mind and 
showed 
up 

ready 
to 
work.
As 
he 

sat 
in 

that 
meeting 
in 

December, with Harbaugh, Drevno 
and his dad around him, Mason 
made his decision.
In eight months, he would start his 
final year of school. In eight months, 
he would start on Michigan’s 
offensive line for a fourth straight 
season. In eight months, he would 
hear his name in All-American 
discussions.
In eight months, he would be 
elected a captain for Michigan, text 
his parents, “Got it”, and call them 
later to hear how proud they were.
The meeting in Drevno’s office 
went on for about an hour and a 
half that day, as the four continued 

laying out what was best for 

Mason. Harbaugh gave him 

his assurance. No matter 

what 
Mason 
chose, 
he 

would have his coaches’ 
full support.
“But,” 
Harbaugh 
said, 

“we’d love to have you 
stay.”

Breakdown: Michigan vs. Cincy

By KEVIN SANTO 

Managing Sports Editor

This 
one 
has 
all 
the 

ingredients to be a laugher.

Cincinnati will travel to Ann 

Arbor this Saturday coming off 
a narrow 26-14 win over Austin 
Peay. To put that in perspective, 
the Governors have not won a 
game in FCS competition since 
Oct. 14, 2014.

No. 8 Michigan, on the other 

hand, is heading into its home 
opener with a lot to be happy 
about. After an offseason in 
which the Wolverines’ youth 
was questioned, Michigan made 
it clear that it wasn’t an issue 
in its season-opening 33-17 win 
over Florida.

There were plenty of mistakes 

to 
correct, 
but 
Michigan 

managed 
to 
win 
despite 

throwing two pick-sixes and 
having a punt blocked. It’d be 
surprising if anything close to 
similar 
circumstances 
carry 

over against the Bearcats. This 
one could be over early.

Here’s how the Wolverines 

match up against Cincinnati on 
Saturday.

Michigan pass offense vs. 

Cincinnati pass defense

Redshirt junior quarterback 

Wilton Speight didn’t open up 
the year in a fashion he would 
have hoped. Against Florida, 
Speight threw two interceptions 
returned for touchdowns on 
consecutive series, giving the 
Gators 14 of their 17 total points.

On 
the 
bright 
side, 
he 

recovered in the second half, 
opening the frame by completing 
five of his seven passes for 52 
yards before junior running 
back Karan Higdon capped it off 
with a touchdown.

To be clear, there is no 

controversy to be had. Speight 
is still Michigan’s quarterback 
— a fact that Jim Harbaugh 
has been quick to emphasize. 
Cincinnati limited Austin Peay 
to just 89 yards and only one 
touchdown through the air, but 
the Governors are a far cry from 
the Wolverines.

Edge: Michigan

Michigan run offense vs

As expected, the Wolverines 

turned — once again — to a 
running back by committee in 
their season opener against the 
Gators. It worked, to say the 
least.

Higdon 
scored 
the 
lone 

rushing 
touchdown, 
but 

Michigan racked up 215 yards on 
59 carries and showed an ability 
to wear down a defense with the 
run game. This time, they may 
not have to wear the Bearcats’ 
defense down at all.

Cincinnati 
allowed 
224 

rushing yards to Austin Peay 
on 
60 
attempts 
— 
nearly 

identical results to Michigan’s 
performance against Florida.

Running backs coach Jay 

Harbaugh 
was 
tight-lipped 

when it came to questions of 
whether Ty Isaac had earned a 
start with his 114-yard, 11-carry 
game, but it likely won’t even 

matter.

Edge: Michigan

Cincinnati pass offense vs 

Michigan pass defense

Do you remember Hayden 

Moore’s debut against Memphis? 
If you don’t, you should.

On Sept. 25, 2015, Moore 

came in to replace Gunner 
Kiel — who went down with an 
injury against the Tigers. Then a 
freshman, he didn’t disappoint, 
finishing with 557 yards and 
four touchdowns.

Since then, however, Moore’s 

career has largely been a tale 
of inconsistencies. He has won 
starting jobs, lost them to injury 
and won them back again. But, 
as almost anyone would, he 
has struggled to capture the 

lightning of 2015 in a bottle.

He had a solid 2017 debut, 

finishing 
with 
151 
yards 

and 
three 
touchdowns, 
but 

Michigan’s secondary looked 
better than expected against the 
Gators. And if the Wolverines’ 
line stuffs the run game, things 
will only get harder for Moore.

Edge: Michigan

Unfortunately 
for 
the 

Bearcats, their most talented 
player is running back Mike 
Boone. He rushed for 100 yards 
on 19 carries against Austin 
Peay, but Michigan is coming 
off a game in which its ability 
to stop the run was the most 
impressive aspect of an all-

around impressive day.

The 
Wolverines 
held 
the 

Gators to 11 rushing yards, and 
Michigan’s 
linebackers 
and 

linemen combined for 25-plus 
tackles — 8.5 of which were for 
loss. Cincinnati will need to 
get creative if it wants its best 
player to touch the ball, so don’t 
be surprised to see Boone in 
some unconventional spots.

Either way, there’s not even 

enough creativity at Google to 
mitigate 
Michigan’s 
defense 

with the way it looked at AT&T 
Stadium.

Fifth-year senior running back Ty Isaac is coming off a 100-plus yard game, and the Bearcats’ defense looked vulnerable against the run in their season opener.

Special teams

The Wolverines have finally 

seen an inexperienced special 
teams unit in action, and they 
should be pleased with the 
results. 
Redshirt 
freshman 

kicker Quinn Nordin converted 
on four of his six field-goal 

opportunities — two of which 
were from 50-plus yards — 
and did so in high-pressure 
situations.

Freshman Donovan Peoples-

Jones, in his own right, flashed 
his athleticism as a punt returner 
and — against a punter not 
named Johnny Townsend, who 
was the best in the country last 
season — could put on a show.

On top of that, the Wolverines 

recovered 
a 
fumble 
on 
the 

opening kickoff of the second 
half against the Gators, and while 
a blocked punt was a blemish 
at AT&T Stadium, Michigan’s 
momentum is trending up.

Edge: Michigan

Intangibles

Boone — the Bearcats’ star — 

has said publicly that he has no 
doubt in his mind that Cincinnati 
can “shock the world” when it visits 
Michigan Stadium this Saturday. 
In fairness, no player would ever 
admit doubt to an opponent before 
the kickoff, but Florida was the 
last team to mouth off about the 
Wolverines’ ability, and Michigan 
didn’t take too kindly to it.

On top of that, it’s the season 

opener in Ann Arbor, and figures 
to be a packed house. Anything 
can happen on any given day, but it 
doesn’t seem like Saturday will be 
one of them.

Edge: Michigan

Prediction: 
Michigan 
41, 

Cincinnati 3

Sophomore linebacker Devin Bush Jr. broke out against the then-17th ranked Gators with seven tackles and two sacks, and has a chance for another massive performance against the Bearcats.

What to Watch For: Cincinnati

By ORION SANG 

Daily Sports Editor

Michigan quieted some of 

its naysayers last week with a 
resounding 33-17 victory against 
then-No. 17 Florida at AT&T 
Stadium. The Wolverines are 
back in Ann Arbor this weekend, 
where they’ll play their home 
opener against Cincinnati. 

Michigan will find a familiar 

face on the opposing sideline 
in first-year head coach Luke 
Fickell, formerly the defensive 
coordinator and interim head 
coach at Ohio State. While the 
Wolverines are well along in their 
rebuild under Jim Harbaugh, the 
Bearcats aren’t — meaning it 
may be difficult for them to beat 
Michigan and ‘shock the world,’ 
as their senior running back 
Mike Boone said they could.

Here’s what to watch for when 

Cincinnati and Michigan kick 
off:

1. The base defense

In a departure from last 

season, defensive coordinator 
Don Brown heavily employed 
the 3-3-5 stack against Florida, 
opting to use redshirt junior 
SAM linebacker Noah Furbush 
in place of redshirt junior nose 
tackle Bryan Mone for much of 
the game.

Last season, Michigan was 

happy to stay in a 4-2-5 shell 
whenever the defense was on 
the field. What the 3-3-5 may 
sacrifice in pure girth and 
power along the line is made up 
by the addition of a linebacker-
type player such as Furbush or 
redshirt freshman Josh Uche. 
That player can put his hand 
in the dirt on passing downs, 
flexing sophomore strong-side 
end Rashan Gary inside, or play 
in the box alongside sophomore 
middle linebacker Devin Bush Jr. 
and fifth-year senior weakside 
linebacker Mike McCray.

The 
new 
look 
confused 

Florida, allowing Michigan to 
pressure the quarterback despite 
only 
rushing 
three 
linemen 

at times, but it remains to be 
seen whether the new scheme 
was a gimmick — meant to be 
used sparingly — or whether 
it’s the new base defense. If the 
Wolverines use the 3-3-5 heavily 
once more this week, that may 
indicate the latter.

2. Who will earn the 

majority of snaps at tight end?

Going into the season, this 

position 
group 
was 
deemed 

deep and the season opener did 
nothing to dispel that notion. In 
fact, the veterans of the group 
— redshirt junior Ian Bunting 
and redshirt sophomore Tyrone 
Wheatley Jr. — may have been 
overshadowed 
by 
younger 

players who were thought to be 
behind in the pecking order.

Sophomore Sean McKeon and 

redshirt freshman Nick Eubanks 
both flashed their tantalizing 
potential in the passing game 
and run-blocking game while 
redshirt 
sophomore 
Zach 

Gentry, a converted quarterback, 
saw plenty of snaps as well.

It’s unclear whether there’s 

a true No. 1 option among the 
group right now. It was assumed 
one of Bunting or Wheatley 
would be ‘the guy.’ There’s a lot 
more uncertainty now after the 
first week; whoever sees the 
field the most, or can convert 
their snaps into production, may 
end up being the leader of the 

pack following this week.

3. Will Speight continue 

looking for the big play?

The 
redshirt 
junior 

quarterback took several shots 
downfield against Florida and 
connected on a few of them, 
including a 46-yard touchdown 
to 
freshman 
receiver 
Tarik 

Black and a 48-yard completion 
to Eubanks. Earlier this week, 
though, Jim Harbaugh spoke 
of the need to allow the deep 
passing 
game 
to 
develop 

naturally, and not to force things 
downfield.

While 
Cincinnati 
allowed 

just 89 passing yards on 19 
attempts against Austin Peay, 
it’s doubtful the Bearcats will 
be able to dictate what Michigan 
does in the passing game. It’ll 
be interesting to see whether 
Speight continues to look for 
big plays — they were certainly 
there against the Gators — or 
whether there’s an emphasis on 
hitting targets in the short and 
intermediate passing game.

4. Rashan Gary Sack Watch

It 
isn’t 
common 
for 
Jim 

Harbaugh to call for a stat 
correction. But he did so Monday, 
telling reporters that Rashan 
Gary should’ve been issued a 
half-sack from Saturday.

Perhaps it’s hard to believe 

that 
Gary, 
the 
much-hyped 

former top recruit, has yet to 
record a full sack through his 
first 14 games. It’s not for a lack 
of ability — he’s gotten to the 
quarterback plenty of times, and 
even recorded a half sack last 
year against Central Florida. In 
the win over the Gators, Gary 
constantly terrorized Florida’s 
offensive 
line, 
making 
life 

difficult for quarterbacks Malik 
Zaire and Feleipe Franks. Once 
again, though, he was unable to 
turn those pressures and hurries 
into an actual sack.

This week, Gary should have 

plenty of opportunities to fill 
the stat sheet. The Bearcats’ 
offensive line should be a step 
down from Florida’s, and given 
Michigan seems likely to shut 
down Cincinnati’s run game 
while simultaneously jumping 
out to a big lead, quarterback 

Hayden Moore may be dropping 
back to pass for much of the 
afternoon. It seems likely that at 
some point, he’ll end up on the 
ground, looking up at Gary.
