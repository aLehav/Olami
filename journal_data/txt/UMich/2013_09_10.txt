Construction to repair pavement on South Forest Avenue will block traffic until Oct. 31.
City to repair S. Fore Ave.

$1.3-million
project will fix
potholes, smooth
bad pavement
By MATT JACKONEN
Daily StaffReporter
Major changes are coming
this fallto South Forest Avenue,
an off-campus street known
for its frequent potholes and
downtrodden pavement.
Last week, the city of Ann
Arbor began construction in a
roughly $1.3-million project to
repair the street that has long
been a nuisance and an eye-

sore for students and residents
living and commuting in Ann
Arbor.
The project will include
changes to the infrastructure
of the road and an updated
water main. Igor Kotlyar, the
project manager for the South
Forest Avenue construction,
said the street was in very poor
condition and won't be com-
pleted until early November.
"It was basically falling
apart," Kotlyar said. "It was
really in need of repairs."
Kotlyar said the water main
will be renovated to be more
eco-friendly. The new system
will redirect into groundwater
rather than store it in the city's
storm sewer system.

Kotlyar said noise from con-
struction shouldn't trouble
residents.
"There is noise from the con-
struction equipment working,
but I don't think there is any
unusual level of noise," Kotlyar
said. "You introduce the con-
struction equipment and take
out the usual amount of traffic,
and you will probably be on the
same noise level."
Business School senior Joel
Mitter said the construction
has caused him minor prob-
lems.
"They do the majority of the
work during the day, but the
times I've been at home, you do
hear them doing construction
and using jackhammers," Mit-

ter said. "Walking to class can
be a pain because there have
been times where guys have
told meI can't crossthe street."
Construction does inconve-
nience those living in the area
that are looking to park on the
street who are now forced to
park farther away.
Jim Kosteva, the Universi-
ty's director of community rela-
tions, said he doesn't believe the
construction will significantly
affect University operations.
"The construction project on
Forest will cause a slow down
for University faculty and staff
who utilize the Forest Street
parking structure," Kosteva
said.

White discusses
ideal candidate for
MSC successor
By BRANDON SHAW
Daily Staff Reporter
Who will be the next University
president? It's a question on the
minds of many at the University,
but few know exactly what goes
into the search process.
That's why Regent Kather-
ine White spoke at Monday's
University Council meeting, to
inform the body on the upcom-
ing search for the next Univer-
sity president. In an interview
outside of the meeting, White
stressed that she wasn't speak-
ing in her official capacity as
vice chair of the presidential
search advisory committee
though did not make that clarifi-
cation to members of University
Council.
The University Council - a
governing board comprised of the
heads of each of the colleges that
make up the University, as well as
the heads of prominent student
organizations on campus - was
created two years ago in the hopes
of adding more student voices to
the University's existing legisla-

tive process.
In an effort to gain input from
students, faculty and staff, White
said the Board of Regents has set
up an e-mail address so that stu-
dents and other interested mem-
bers of the University community
can comment and suggest nomina-
tions for University president. The
address is hosted by Russell Reyn-
olds Associates, the professional
firm that was hired for the presi-
dential search in July.
White said it's important to find
a candidate who excels at develop-
ment, a skill that she said Univer-
sity President Mary Sue Coleman
possesses.
"If you look at where we're
building, it's athletic, it's hospital,
it's dormitories; but if you look
at the core undergraduate mis-
sion, all of the core, we need to
find more money to raise money
and invest there," White said. "It's
harder because people wantto give
money for flashier things. So, that's
what we have to work on."
White added that a candidate's
research background and academ-
ic expertise will also be a major
factor.
"I want someone who's got real
merit, academic chops, to run the
institution," White said. "Even
though we need other skills, I

In an effort to increase student
influence in the search for the next
University president, the University
Council brought forward a resolu-
tion to establish a separate student
committee that would assist the
presidential search advisory com-
mittee in its work.
In 2001, when former University
President Lee Bollinger announced
his resignation, the University's
Board of Regents announced the
creation of a committee that includ-
ed two students.

RAINY DAY -

Starry-eyed physics professor

David Gerdes is a professor in
the Department of Physics. He is
currently teaching an introduc-
tory physics course and is work-
ing with the Dark Energy Survey
to map a large portion of the sky.
How did you first become
interested in physics?
Some of my earliest memories
from when I was very little were
of the Apollo moon landings and
being allowed to stay up much
later than my parents had ever
allowed me to stay up so that
I could watch the astronauts
get out and walk on the moon.
That sparked an interest for me
in astronomy and space. When
I started thinking about what

to do in college, I asked around
about what you should study if
you wanted to be an astrono-
mer. I assumed the answer
was astronomy, but everyone I
talked to said, "No, don't study
astronomy. Study physics." You
need to know lots of physics to
do astronomy, and eventually
you can specialize in astronomy
in graduate school.
So did you end up specializing
in astronomy?
I actually went to graduate
school and studied elementary
particle physics. I did my thesis
on a particle collider experi-
ment at the Fermilab outside
Chicago and spent my time

studying high-energy particle
collisions. In 1998, while I was
in the middle of doing this, a
discovery was made that the
expansion rate of the universe
is accelerating, and you can
obtain an accelerating universe
if you put a term - called the
cosmological constant - back in
to Einstein's theory of general
relativity equation. It turned
out that 75 percent of the uni-
verse is this weird property of
empty spaced called dark ener-
gy. That seemed like the sort of
discovery that was worth drop-
ping what you're working on to
try to figure out, and that's how
I got back into astronomy as a
grownup.

MOSCOW (AP) - Syria on
Monday quickly welcomed
a call from Russia, its close

arsenals under international
control, then destroy them to
avert a U.S. strike, but did not
offer a time frame or any other

20 suspected
militants killed,
20 captured
EL-ARISH, Egypt (AP) -
Egyptian troops and tanks
backed by helicopter gunships
swept through villages in the
northern Sinai Peninsula near
the border with the Palestinian
Gaza Strip on Monday, the third
day of a major offensive against
Islamic extremists, a military
official said. So far, some 20
suspected militants have been
killed and 20 captured in the
operation, he added.
Explosions rocked
el-Mahdiya and Naga Shabana,
two of several villages south of
the town of Rafah, the official
said, where the military hit
targets and shelters used by
militants wanted for the killing
and abduction of Egyptian
soldiers over the past year.
A day earlier, an al-Qaida-
inspired militant group based in
the area claimed responsibility
for last week's failed
assassination attempt on Egypt's
interior minister, describing the
Cairo attack as a "suicide" car
bomb.
The claim could not be
independently verified but it
appeared on militant websites
that regularly distribute
statements from al-Qaida-linked
groups. If true, it would mark
the first time Sinai militants
took their fight to the heart
of the Egyptian capital with a
suicide attack.
Tourist resorts along the
southern coast of the rocky,
desert region saw a string of
suicide bombings in the mid-
2000s thatleft atleast125people
dead and triggered mass arrests
and detentions of thousands
of Bedouin tribesman. The
crackdown soured relations
between locals and the central
government, intensifying
the Bedouins' feelings of
mistreatment and turning the

northern end of the peninsula
into an incubator for Islamic
extremism.
Like Ansar Jerusalem, other
Sinai-based al-Qaida inspired
groups have been blamed for a
spike of attacks against military
and police in northern Sinai
since the military ousted former
Islamist President Mohammed
Morsi on July 3.
The increase in violence
has raised suspicions of links
between Morsi's Muslim
Brotherhood and Islamic
militant groups. Military
officials have accused Morsi of
handlingthegroupstooleniently
and striking a truce with them
to halt their attacks in return for
suspending military operations
against them during his year in
office. This truce, they say, gave
militants free reign to stockpile
weapons, evidenced by the large
caches of anti-aircraft missiles,
mortars, and RPGs and other
weapons seized by the army
since Saturday.
Mustafa Hegazy, the interim
president's political adviser, told
Egyptian TV station Al-Hayat
that under Morsi's rule, the
number of militants in Sinai
jumped to 7,000 or more from
1,000.
"It is graver than what we
thought,"he said in a late Sunday
interview. He said the attempt
on the interior minister did not
signal a broader deterioration
of Egypt's security, which was
being "restored" across the
country.
In the Ansar Jerusalem
statement posted late Sunday,
the group said it carried out
the attack on Interior Minister
Gen. Mohammed Ibrahim's
motorcade to avenge Muslims
killed by security forces
during their violent Aug. 14
dismantlement of two sprawling
encampments set up in Cairo
by pro-Morsi supporters
demanding his reinstatement.
The day left hundreds dead in
what was an unprecedented
bloodbath. It also sparked a wave

of unrest across the country
where pro-Morsi supporters
attacked churches and police
stations.
"The Interior Ministry, the
slaughterer, has seen death with
its own eyes from a martyrdom
operation carried out by a lion
of Egypt's lions," the statement
said. "What is coming will be
worse," it added.
"We pledge to God the
Almighty to seek revenge for
Muslims on all those who
contributed to their killings and
assaulting their honor, above
all el-Sissi and Mohammed
Ibrahim," it said, also referring
to Egypt's Military Chief Gen.
Abdel-Fatah el-Sissi who led
the coup against Morsi after
millions took to the streets
demanding his resignation for
abuse of power.
The statement urged
Muslims to stay away from
the ministries of interior and
defense, indicating that these
two institutions willbe targeted.
It also showed an ideological
proximity to al-Qaida, citing an
Aug. 3 statement by the group's
leader, Ayman al-Zawahri, that
mocked the democratic process
and called upon "soldiers of the
Quran to wage the war for the
Quran," the Muslim holybook.
An Egyptian security official
said authorities are still studying
the statement, but confirmed
that human remains suspected
to belong to the suicide bomber
were found inside the car used
in the bombing. The Health
Ministry said that one person
died a day later of wounds
sustained during the attack, and
more than 20 were injured.
Ansar Jerusalem does
not have a proven record of
carrying out attacks outside of
Sinai. It has previously claimed
responsibility for attacks on
gas pipelines to Israel, rockets
targeting Israel and a 2012
shootout along the Israeli-
Egyptian border in which three
militants and an Israeli soldier
were killed.

Zimmerman arrested, Wife
and father drop charges

Florida man in
police custody again
following Trayvon
Martin case
LAKE MARY, Fla. (AP) -
The sobbing wife of George
Zimmerman called 911 Monday
to report that her estranged
husband was threatening her
with a gun and had punched
her father in the nose, but hours
later decided not to press charg-
es against the man acquitted of
all charges for fatally shooting
Trayvon Martin.
Lake Mary police officers
were still investigating the
encounter as a domestic dis-
pute, but no charges had been
filed Monday afternoon. Shellie
Zimmerman left the house after
being questioned by police.
George Zimmerman remained
there into early evening and his
attorney denied any wrongdo-
ing by his client. He was not
arrested.
Shellie Zimmerman, who has
filed for divorce, initially told a
911 dispatcher that her husband
had ihs hadiosghisgci ~ alib
sat in his car outside the home

she was at with her father. She
said she was scared because she
wasn't sure what Zimmerman
was capable of doing. Hours
later she changed her story and
said she never saw a firearm,
said Lake Mary Police Chief
Steve Bracknell.
For the time being, "domes-
tic violence can't be invoked
because she has changed her
story and says she didn't see a
firearm," Bracknell said.
On the 911 call, Shellie Zim-
merman is sobbing and repeat-
ing "Oh my God" as she talks
to a police dispatcher. She yells
at her father to get inside the
house, saying Zimmerman may
start shooting at them.
"He's threatening all of us
with a firearm... He punched my
dad in the nose," Shellie Zim-
merman said on the call. "I don't
know what he's capable of. I'm
really scared."
She also said he grabbed an
iPad from her hand and smashed
it.
Zimmerman's attorney, Mark
O'Mara, said his client never
threatened his estranged wife
and her father with a gun and
never punched his father-in-law.
Shellie Ziimernian had col-
lected most of her belongings

Saturday from the house, which
is owned by her parents, where
she and George had both been
staying there until she moved
out. She had returned unex-
pectedly Monday to gather the
remaining items. Emotions got
out of control, but neither side is
filing charges against the other,
O'Mara said.
"I know the 911 tape sug-
gests that Shellie was saying
something but I think that was
heightened emotions," O'Mara
said. "There may have been
some pushing and touching.
That happens alot in divorce sit-
uations ... Nobody was injured."
Her father also declined to
press charges, the police chief
said.
Prosecutors could still build a
case based on surveillance video
from cameras outside the house
and also video from the squad
cars of officers who responded.
Floridalaw allows policeofficers
to arrest someone for domestic
violence without the consent of
the victim.
Police spokesman Zach Hud-
son said the estranged husband
and wife were blaming each
other for being the aggressor
and that 'olice officers were
sorting through their accounts.

Boost attributed to
electronics, homes
and major deals
The stock market got a boost
on Monday from mergers,
homes, and phones.
Stocks posted their biggest
gains in almost two months.
Two big deals suggested grow-
ing confidence in the economy:
Luxury retailer Neiman Marcus
was sold for $6billion, andKoch
Industries bought electronics
component maker Molex for
$7.2 billion.
Homebuilding stocks were
some of the biggest gainers in
the Standard & Poor's 500 index
after Hovnavian Enterprises
said home prices are rising and
its backlog jumped almost 27
percent from a year earlier.
Hovnanian rose 11 cents, or
2.2 percent, to close at $5.15.
PulteGroup, D.R. Horton and
Lennar alsogained. Homebuild-
er MDC Holdings rose $1.72, or
6.2 percent, to $29.37 after an
upgrade from a Citi analyst.
Homebuilding stocks have
had a volatile year. Investors
have been bullish because the
housing market is recovering,
but worried that rising inter-
est rates make mortgages more
expensive for home buyers.
Apple rose. It's expected
to announce a new iPhone on
Tuesday.
The Dow Jones industrial
average rose 140.62 points, or 1
percent, to 15,063.12. The Dow
hit an all-time high of 15,658 on
Aug. 2. But worries about Syria
and rising interest rates pushed
stocks down since then. The
last time the Dow closed above
15,000 was Aug. 23.
The S&P 500 index rose 16.54
points, or 1 percent, to 1,671.71.
The Nasdaq composite rose
46.17 points, or 1.3percent, tb~
3,706.18. Both the Dow and the
S&P 500 had their biggest daily
gains since July11.
All 10 industry groups in the
S&P 500 rose. The index rose
for the fifth day in a row, the
longest since eight days of gains
in July.
Two things about the Koch-
Molex deal grabbed investors'
attention: Its components show
up in a wide variety of products,
including housing and autos, so
Koch's interest suggests that it
sees broad economic improve-
ment. Also, Koch is paying a

large premium for Molex.
Koch is paying $38.50 per
share, 31 percent over Molex's
stock price on Friday. Molex
soared $9.29, or almost 32 per-
cent, to $38.63 on Monday.
"I think it's really exciting
for just about everybody to see
that big of a deal go through,"
said Kim Forrest, senior ana-
lyst with portfolio management
firm Fort Pitt Capital Group in
Pittsburgh.
Apple rose back above
$500 per share. It last closed
above that level on Aug. 26.
Apple gained $7.95, or 1.6 per-
cent, to $506.17 on Monday in
advance of an expected iPhone
announcement on Tuesday.
Delta Air Lines jumped $1.87,
or 9.4 percent, to $21.76 after
news that it would be added to
the S&P 500 index. That bene-
fits Delta because mutual funds
and other investors that track
the S&P 500 will now have to
buy Delta's stock. JPMorgan
analyst Jamie Baker estimated
that inclusion in the index will
add demand for almost 89 mil-
lion Delta shares.
Stocks in Asia rose lifted by
Tokyo's win for the 2020 Sum-
mer Olympics, Chinese export
growth and an election vic-
tory by Australia's conservative
coalition.
The coalition supports
repealing a 30 percent tax on
coal and iron ore miners' profits,
which could help mining and
other raw material companies.
Caterpillar, which makes min-
ing gear used in China and Aus-
tralia, rose $2.20, or 2.6 percent,.
to $85.59, and mining company
Cliffs Natural Resourceswas up
$1.33, or 6.1 percent, to $23.18.
The positive news out of
the Asia-Pacific region helped
outweigh worries about ris-
ing interest rates and Syria,
said Doug Cote, chief market
strategist at ING U.S. Invest-
ment Management. "The risk
of taking action seems too great
for them to act," he said. "I'm
watching it daily, but I'm cer-
tainly not worried about it."
In U.S. government bond
trading, the yield on the 10-year
Treasury note fell to 2.92 per-
cent from 2.94 percent late Fri-
day.
It traded as high as 3 percent
last Thursday, a key psychologi-
cal level because the 10-year
yield is the most widely used
benchmark for borrowing in
the U.S.

President of Kenya charged with
orchestration of election violence

Kenyan president
charged with deadly
post-election
violence
THE HAGUE, Netherlands
(AP) - Against a backdrop of
risingskepticism and opposition
in Kenya, the country's deputy
president goes on trial Tuesday
at the International Criminal
Court, charged with helping
orchestrate deadly violence that
erupted after disputed 2007
elections.
Final preparations for the
landmark trial - the first time
a sitting vice president has been
tried at the ICC - were over-
shadowed Monday by pros-
ecutors alleging widespread
witness intimidation and Ruto's
lawyer claiming the case was
built on false testimony.
"What the truth will show
is that there has been a cabal
put together that has concocted
stories that have been swal-
lowed hook, line and sinker by
the prosecution," Ruto's lawyer
Karim Khan said. He called the
prosecution case "a lamentable
shambles" and "parody of jus-
tice."
Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda,
meanwhile, said there had been
repeated deliberate attempts to
undermine her case by intimi-
dating witnesses, some of whom
have pulled out of the trial.
Bensouda would not say what
impact the intimidation had
on her evidence, but vowed to
go after people targeting wit-
nesses.
"This is ongoing, it is orga-
nized, it is happening," she told
reporters at the court. "Those
who are committing these
crimes are goingto great lengths
to cover their identity."
Ruto is charged alongside
broadcaster Joshua Arap Sang
with murder, deportation and

persecution - all crimes against
humanity - linked to weeks of
savage tribe-on-tribe attacks
violence that left more than
1,000 Kenyans dead and forced
hundreds of thousands from
their homes. Both men insist
they are innocent.
Kenyan President Uhuru
Kenyatta faces similar charges
of helping to orchestrate the vio-
lence. His trial is scheduled to
start in November.
Ruto's trial is the culmination
of years of work by International
Criminal Court investigators
after Kenyan authorities failed
to hold to account any of the
leaders of the violence.
While Kenyans once over-
whelmingly supported the inter-
vention of the ICC, opinion has
turned against the international
body, soured in part by the long
passage of time.
Kenya's parliament last week
passed a voice vote motion to
withdraw from the ICC. The
vote is symbolic and non-bind-
ing; only Kenya's government
can decide to withdraw from
the ICC and it will have no
effect on the trials of Kenyatta
and Ruto.
But the vote was carried out
by the majority in Parliament,
which Kenyan voters put into
office in March, the same time
theyvoted in Kenyatta and Ruto,
who were under indictments
by the ICC. The pair's election
campaign had played up the idea
that the West was meddling in
Kenyan affairs.
The court's registrar, Herman
von Hebel, said the motion sent
the "wrongmessage" in the fight
against impunity in Kenya.
"Victims of the future should
not feel that they are without
redress to this court and to
international justice," he said.
Rights activists welcomed the
opening of the trial as a way of
breaking a cycle of violence after
recent Kenyan elections.
"For decades those who

have turned Kenya's elections
into bloodbaths have gotten
away with murder," said Dan-
iel Bekele, Africa director at
Human Rights Watch. "This
ICC trial tackles an impunity
crisis in the country and offers
a chance for justice denied to
Kenyans by their own govern-
ment."
Ngujiri Wambugu, a promi-
nent social activist in Kenya,
once helped collect more than
1 million signatures in support
of an ICC intervention, after
Kenyan prosecutors failed to
bring forward significant judi-
cial action. Today, Wambugu is
against the ICC intervention.
"It is quite clear ICC is not
being fair," Wambugu said in a
column that asked why the lead-
ers of the United States and Brit-
ain haven't been indicted for the
invasion of Iraq, or why Syrian
President Bashar Assad is not
being held responsible for the
tens of thousands of deaths over
the last year in Syria.
That is a sentiment shared
across large parts of Africa.
The court so far has indicted
only suspects from Africa, lead-
ing to charges on that continent
that it is biased.
The court so far has indicted
only suspects from Africa, lead-
ing to charges on that continent

of the African Union earlier this
year said that ICC prosecutions
"have degenerated into some
kind of race hunt."
Kennyatta and Ruto spent the
weekend in Kenya's Rift Valley,
where hundreds of Kenyan fam-
ilies booted from their homes
during the 2007-08 violence still
live in shabby United Nations
tents.
The government gave the
internally displaced families
a check for about $5,000 each
- enough to buy a small plot of
land - inan attempt to close one
of the sadder chapters of Kenya's
internal violence.

St. Clair River woes are
deemed to be cyclical,
water levels still down

Low water levels
continue to be a
problem for
midwest rivers
MILWAUKEE (AP) - Placing
water retention structures in the
St. Clair River may not be enough
to counteract the effects of a
warming climate and raise Lakes
Huron and Michigantotheirnor-
mallevelsexperts said Monday.
As water surface tempera-
tures and evaporation rates
continue to rise, low water is
likely to be a long-term problem
despite significant improvement
this year following heavy snows
in winter and a rainy spring,
according to testimony during
the annual meeting of the Great
Lakes Commission.
"Water levels go up and
down," said Scudder Mackey,
coastal management chief with
the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources. "It's a natural pro-
cess, something that we have to
learn to live with."
Levels have been mostly
below normal on all five Great
Lakes since the late 1990s, but
the drop-off has been most
severe on Huron and Michigan,
which scientists consider one
lake because they are connected.

Huron-Michigan has jumped
20 inches since January, exceed-
ing its usual seasonal rise, said
Keith Kompoltowicz, a meteo-
rologist with the Detroit office
of the U.S. Army Corps of Engi-
neers. Still, it remains 17 inches
below its long-term average.
Lake Superior is also slightly
below its long-term average,
while Lakes Erie and Ontario
have exceeded theirs.
Groups representing shore-
line interests in Lake Huron,
particularly in sprawling Geor-
gian Bay, say climate isn't the
only reason water there is
extraordinarily low. They blame
dredging, gravel mining and
other activities that eroded the
floor of the St. Clair River on
Huron's southern end, acceler-
ating the flow toward Lake Erie.
Studies have shown those
actions caused Huron and Michi-
gan to fall 10 to 16 inches. Some
groups put the loss at 20 inches.
In April, the International
Joint Commission - which
advises the U.S. and Canada
about the Great Lakes and other
shared waters - recommended
a study of installing structures
resembling underwater speed
bumps in the St. Clair that
could raise Huron and Michi-
gan by 5 to 10 inches. Neither
federal government has acted
on the proposal.

Sobering guidance
Intervention, not punishment, is key to helping addicted students
For new freshmen at the University, figuring out how to allo-
cate time between coursework, student organizations, night-
life and other activities can be a daunting task. A new policy
at the University of Idaho makes this juggling act even harder - now,
freshmen who are unable to achieve that balance and receive a GPA
of 1.0 or lower will be expelled. While this policy is part of a larger
initiative aimed at combating underage drinking, it's uniquely mis-
guided. The University of Idaho should find other options to deal
with underage drinking - options that support students academi-
cally and address the underlying problem, instead of just expelling
students for having an extremely low first-semester GPA.

For a lot of people, loving
Michigan is something
intuitive, like loving Nutella
crepes. What
could there
possibly be to
explain?
I do love
Michigan, but it
took me a long
way to get here,
and it's been a ZEINAB
thorny relation- KHALIL
ship. A part of
me just wants to
forget myself in chants amid a sea
of maize and blue, or lie on the Diag
forever and watch autumn transform
our campus into a pretty postcard.
But the other part of me can't
fully indulge this relationship
because of the many micro-aggres-
sions on this campus that are too
hard for me to ignore.
My memories of the past three
years - as much as I've grown from
them - include many painful real-
izations of how unfriendly this place
can be. They include times when a
hug was used to compensate for a
racist comment at a meeting and I
conceded because I was too tired
of being the only one in the room to
respond. They include times when
seeing campus police made me feel
less safe because of how conde-
scendingly they behaved with me in
the past. They include times when
racially coded words were used by a
professor I thought I could trust.
Of course, such micro-aggres-
sions aren't unique to our campus,
and there are the sunny moments
and the tough ones in any place. But
I wouldn't have been able to make
it past all these tough moments if it
weren't for the safe spaces I had to
turn to - places where I was wel-
come and didn't have to explain my
being or make disclaimers, speak in
a different tone or smile extra hard to
ease someone else's prejudice.
Places where I could be.
Safe spaces intentionally catered
to students of color - whether pro-
vided by a student organization, an
internal community forum or a Uni-

versity office - are crucial.
Unfortunately, those spaces are
often unappreciated or viewed
warily.
I experienced this sentiment as a
group of friends and I talked about
forming a women-of-color collective
on campus. Our conversation was
soon consumed with questions like:
'What about white feminists who
identify with our cause? How are we
going to include them?'
Similarly, I experienced this sen-
timent as I brainstormed a campus-
wide anti-racist campaignwith some
peers. 'How will we get white stu-
dents to care about diversity? Should
we try to sell some point, like that

to "sell" it to people who don't want
their conscience bothered.
If knowingthat your privilege and
the institutions around you elevate
you at the expense of holding back
others isn't "incentive" enough for
you to give a damn, excuse me if I
don't feel like expending my time and
energy convincing you to be a decent
human being.
Safe spaces are not intended tobe
classrooms and should not be viewed
as such - hence, they are not "miss-
ing the point" at all. There's a time
and place for white people to be
enlightened, have their conscious-
ness raised and discover their privi-
lege - this space isn't one of them.

For better or worse, underage drinking hap-
pens on college campuses and is an important
issue when it comes to students' health and
safety. As such, universities should address
it through programs focusing on awareness
and counseling for students who are actu-
ally abusing alcohol. The University of Idaho
has taken steps in this direction other than
the expulsion policy, including the creation of
a required class for incoming freshmen that
addresses substance abuse, new guidelines for
fraternities and sororities for "alcohol-related
activities" and the hiring ofnew staff members
tasked with monitoring new policies - but that
isn't enough.
Investing in an academic intervention pro-
gram for students whose grades aren't up to
par would be beneficial, since transitioning to
college presents differing difficulties for every
student - even those who don't drink at all.
LSA's policy regarding student academic per-
formance states that the University can sus-
pend those students whose GPA is close to 0
or substantially below a 2.0 in their academic
major, r-quiring them to take-a semester off
before requesting readmission to the Univer-
sity. This gives struggling students time to deal
with whatever it is that's preventing them from
performingwell academically. It also putsthem
in contact with a member of the Academic Stan-
dards Board so they can discuss the student's
suspension and where to go from there. While

it's still unnecessarily harsh, this policy gives
students a break and shows that the Univer-
sity maintains its investment in those students'
futures - something the University of Idaho's
policy doesn't do.
If the administration at the University of
Idaho wants to curb underage drinking at its
school, it might want to take a look at some of
the innovative policies other colleges and uni-
versities around the country have put in place.
Stanford University has what its students call
an "open-door" policy, where students drink-
ing in their rooms in residence halls who leave
their doors open don't have to fear an inter-
vention from police just because there may
be underage drinking going on. This forces
drinking into a more public atmosphere; such
a policy could encourage both less drinking
and increased safety of those who do drink.
Bentley University has an initiative called
OneLess, which educates students about
alcohol and encourages them to consume
one fewer alcoholic beverage whenever they
do choose to drink. After only one year, this
program has resulted in a student body that
drinks more moderately.
Underage drinking is a reality - but that
doesn't mean colleges and universities have
no power to affect it. Through programs that
distribute information about how to stay safe
while drinking and provide academic support,
students' college experiences can be improved.

Love thy bathroom

KATE
LARAMIE

I could've written about Syria, about war:
carnivorous like fire, grinning like sin. I
could've written about my first trip into the
Big House, where a crowd becomes a body
in itself, its arms the cheerleaders, its legs
the football team, its face a yellow hue of
T-shirts. I could've written about my first
week of classes and my major and my profes-
sor and my classmates and my computer and
my folder and my backpack and how it makes
this annoying clanking noise as I walk. And I
could've written about all of the other cliche
and expected things a freshman might.
But Ididn't.
4612-T, Lewis House, Bursley Residence
Hall, the men's bathroom. In an attempt to
save energy, the lights only turn on as you
walk in. The darkness embodies abyss. Flo-
rescent lights throw a bright, white light
upon the objects around you. You squint. Still,
you are aware enough to see what lies around
you: eleven sinks, one soap dispenser with a
60-percent success rate and a hand dryer that
does not dry, but effectively creates a ruckus.
To your right are four urinals and four bath-
room stalls, the latter equipped with morose,
grey doors. Farther down the way are the
showers behind yet another door; water tem-
peratures range from Antarctic to scalding
hot and change intermittently. To your left
is a mirror purveying the sight of your sorry
existence - perhaps following a Thirsty
Thursday. Everything is dirty. On that note,
just beneath you is the floor: Faded gray inlets
outline faded grey tiles. Moist footprints
leading across the bathroom darken the grey
into a shade of black.
This is the bathroom you are to inhabit for
your freshman year.
So you settle. You pick your favorite bath-
room or shower stall and live with it. The best

sink is chosen - the one that isn't clogged
with ... well, let's not talk about that. Return-
ing to the same bathroom stall or shower, you
retrace your steps. A schedule has been made.
The toothpaste and mouthwash assorted,
mirrors are gazed into unnecessarily, for the
looker already knows what his reflection will
tell. And time and time again, history will
repeat itself; weather variable, the bathroom
will remain a control in the experiment.
Until it doesn't.
In the coming years, you may forget it (or
try to). It may not dawn upon you that you've
left it behind - the routines and memories,
the friends and associates, the people, the
Michiganders. Your graduation day will sure-
lyoverlook it, eveninthatintrospectivemood.
But it will dawn on you one day; and when that
immense notion dawns upon a once ignorant
mind, you'll be washing your hands with that
apricot and cinnamon-scented hand soap you
found for a great price in a Good Housekeep-
ing Magazine. You'll look around and notice
every piece of the bathroom is perfectly put
together: None of the paint is chipped, the
toilet glows white, the shampoo leaves not a
hint of soap scum, as advertised on that daz-
zling Dove commercial.
Confounded with boredom, you will sign
an empty wall, for imperfection breeds emo-
tion in a wonderfully hidden way, and fault-
lessness the opposite. Deformity is beloved
subconsciously not by humanity's natural
laziness, but by his sympathetic attachment
to objects around him, for he knows he is
lucky - no, blessed - as only he can have an
item flawed in such a particular way.
Enjoy the inhospitality while it lasts. It
won't.

The article, written by Howard

in the Grand Rapids Press, was
inspiring to read, as I have my own

of the same trail. However, I was a
little dismayed to find that, like most
accounts of20-something's spending
time in the great outdoors, the arti-
cle couldn't come to an end without
mentioning a few of the stereotypes
of the "Millennial Generation."
"Inanera when manyyoung adults

White also emphasized
that the confidentiality will
be very important throughout
the interview process, "so that
when we do select someone, we
haven't had some leak of infor-
mation that could be a prob-
lem."
White referenced Coleman,
who was president at the Univer-
sity of Iowa at the time she inter-
viewed for her current position at
the University, as a prime exam-
ple of why the candidate process
should remain secret until it's
completed.
"Think about if she hadn't
gotten the job, how that would
have looked on her career - on
her life at Iowa - that she was
interviewing elsewhere. So,
confidentiality is of the utmost
importance."

cerns from police and security
chiefs and create multi-faceted
strategies for education, train-
ing, as well as environmental and
infrastructure design.
One of Washington's biggest
priorities is to ensure that there
are open lines of communica-
tion between law enforcement
officials and the community.
Though most would think law
enforcement data is about crime
mapping and incident statistics,
Washington said it's more than
that.
"When you think about
data, you think about num-
bers and lines," he said. "I
think about relationships. So,
when you have relationships
with a broader, traditional and
non-traditional folks, in law
enforcement those are your
information streams."
Washington said he stands
in more of a strategic, vision-
ary role than the University's
police and security chiefs, who
deal with day-to-day opera-
tions.
"We feel like there are
opportunities for usto fill some
gaps in a broader way, and by
educating our community in
areas like workplace violence,
or an active shooter," Washing-
ton said. "In each one of those
areas ... education and training
is being done, but it's not nec-
essarily unified, and it's not a
blended approach to safety and
security."
Nonetheless, Washington said
he will remain transparent and

will develop cross-department
strategies.
Working with multiple units,
including departments in the
Division of Student Affairs,
Washington said there's oppor-
tunity for a more consortium-
based approach to community
policing.
"I think that education is
always a two-way street,"
Washington said. "I think
there's always opportunity for
us to learn from the community:
what their needs are, what the
trends are, and make sure that
we're equipped to contribute
as part of a broader multidis-
ciplinary approach to problem
solving."
Washington said it's impor-
tant to look at emergency pre-
paredness as a University-wide
responsibility. He said DPSS will
work with unit heads to develop
security plans that fit their spe-
cific needs.
He wants to take a more in-
depth look at building access and
the protection of property, both
physical and intellectual.
During the day, entrances
to most University buildings -
with the exception of residence
halls and some parts of the
medical campus - are largely
unrestricted. Washington said
it's important for people to be
aware of their surroundings as
to deter troublesome visitors,
but noted that there may be
other options for the University
to further protect its assets and
community.
Some of the possibilities
Washington offered for addi-
tional security included a
requirement that Mcards be

worn at all times, or the instal-
lation of additional video sur-
veillance.
Currently, the University
employs relatively few surveil-
lance cameras. In the past,
student and civic groups have
rallied around the idea of limit-
ing surveillance at the University
and in Ann Arbor.
Though he understands
individuals in the University
community may have con-
cerns about video surveillance,
Washington said the University
should be prepared to imple-
ment more video cameras if
there's tolerance for them on
campus.
Both the DPSS and Wash-
ington's role were created after
a report from the security con-
sulting firm Margolis Healy
& Associates exposed seri-
ous communication problems
among University Police and
other security agencies on cam-
pus. The report was compiled
after faults in communication
resulted in a six-month delay
in reporting a Medical resident
Stephen Jenson's possession
of child pornography to law
enforcement.
Even though the report pro-
vides recommendations as
to how the University should
improve communication among
security agencies following the
Jenson incident, Washington
said he doesn't plan on reflecting
on past problems.
"I'm looking forward," Wash-
ington said. "I'm accountable
for what happens now. I believe
that the leaders in place, and to
come, now will have that same
opinion."

LEADERS
From Page 1
Bobby Dishell, president of the
University Council, initially sent
out a report to CSG Assembly
representatives that detailed the
creation of a Presidential Search
Commission under the execu-
tive branch of CSG, but that
order was not passed.
Monday night's resolution
brought forth the student com-
mittee as an alternative that
would extend the push for stu-
dent input beyond the boundar-
ies of student government.
The University Council reso-
lution says the new student com-
mittee would presenta recorded
report of student input during
public forums and continue to
provide input throughout the
year until the president was
selected.
Ten student leaders from
student governing bodies and
organizations throughout the
University will sit on the com-
mittee, including those from
the Arab Student Association,
University of Michigan Hil-
lel, Residence Halls Association,
National Panhellenic Council,
Rackham Student Government,
Dance Marathon, Interfraterni-
ty Council, Black Student Union
and Graduate Employees' Orga-
nization.
"We tailored (the resolution)
to make sure that we canbe most
effective as a student body,"
Dishell said after the meeting.
"While student government
represents the student voices,
it's also important to really get
down to the grassroots parts of

these communities and not just
take from the top."
Dishell will sit onthe commit-
tee and Proppe will serve as an
ex-officio, non-voting member.
In an interview at the meet-
ing, LSA Student Government
President Sagar Lathia said
LSA-SG will actively work to
culminate input from its school
by surveys and other outreach
mechanisms.
While he said he believed
that the student committee was
the "closest we can get" to hav-
ing students personally sit on
the PSAC, Lathia was optimistic
about its ability to push its input
into the PSAC's final decisions.
While the regents have yet
to publicly announce their final
interview or selection process
for the presidential candidates
put forth by the PSAC, Regent
Katherine White (D) assured the
student government leaders that
their solicited input would be
incorporated.
"We have not put anything
in stone of how we're handling
this; it's just about getting as
much information as we can,"
White said. "We want continued
information with the input that
you're going to give us and we
don'twant that to end."
As per the CSG Constitu-
tion, the resolution, having
been approved by the University
Council, will now go through a
vote of the larger assembly Tues-
day evening during its weekly
meeting.
"The fact that we got this
committee created not for noth-
ing (shows that) we can get the
regents to hear our voices,"
Dishell said.


Mexican President gambles
with left-leaning reform

Philadelphia public schools start '
year with over 2,000 fewer employees

Nieto plans to
increase social
spending and
raise taxes
MEXICO CITY (AP) - Presi-
dent Enrique Pena Nieto is
gambling that a surprise plan
to increase social spending and
raise taxes on wealthier Mexi-
cans can quiet much of the left-
wing opposition to his most
ambitious proposal, opening the
state-owned oil company to pri-
vate investment, analysts and
politicians said Monday.
Pena Nieto took aback crit-
ics and supporters alike Sunday
night with a fiscal reform plan
that would introduce Mexico's
first national pension and unem-
ployment insurance plans, along
with its first capital gains and
dividends taxes, its first carbon
tax and its first tax on sugary
drinks.
The plan would also close a
series of tax loopholes and raise
the tax rate on the country's
highest earners.
Many of the measures are
aimed at what was long thought
to be the fiscal reform's primary
goal: increasing one of the lowest
tax collection rates in the devel-
oped world, analysts said. Others
are clearly designed to placate the
left as Pena Nieto tries to push
through a controversial reform
allowing private investment in
the underperforming state oil
firm, Pemex, before the end of his
first year in office, they said.
Notably, the fiscal reform
would not impose the sales tax on
food and medicine, a step that had
been widely expected and was
certain to generate outrage from
the left. The government said the
reform plan, most of which needs
only a majority vote in congress,
would add more than $18 billion
in additional revenues next year,

less than many economic ana-
lysts had hoped.
"It's reallyaleft-wingreform, a
center-left-wing reform thatgoes
in a progressive direction," said
Carlos Elizondo Meyer-Serra,
a political science professor at
the Center for Economic Teach-
ing and Research, a Mexico City
think tarik.:"You create less pres-
sure in the street. In that sense
it's a correct strategy."
During his first nine months,
Pena Nieto worked with the
country's two main opposition
parties to pass reforms of the
tightly concentrated telecommu-
nications market and the union-
controlled education system.
But his leftist allies in the
Democratic Revolution Party, or
PRD, aren't backing his overhaul
of the state oil company, Pemex
- the centerpiece of his bid to
reverse years ofeconomicstagna-
tion by addressing some of Mex-
ico's longest-standing structural
problems.
And leftist Andres Manuel
Lopez Obrador, who lost to Pena
Nieto last year, then split with the
PRD over its cooperation with
the new president, has promised
a series of protests to halt the
Pemex reform. Polls say most
Mexicans agree with him.
Adding to the threat for Pena
Nieto are thousands of members
of a dissident teachers union who
flooded into Mexico City to pro-
test his education reform and
have promised to keep upa series
of disruptive marches.
Pena Nieto announced the fis-
cal reform hours after the first of
Lopez Obrador's demonstrations
in Mexico City. The announce-
ment stole much of the attention
from the protest, which saw a
smaller-than-expected turnout.
"I think it was a proposal with
a political sense of urgency," said
Alfredo Coutino, Latin America
director for Moody's Analytics.
"The fact that it didn't include tax
on food and medicine has a lot

to do with the unrest that we've
seen."
That was a boost for Mexico's
biggest food companies, whose
stock prices went up Monday,
driving a 2.6 percent rise in the
index that tracks the major com-
panies listed on the Mexican
Stock Exchange.
The new social benefits
require constitutional chang-
es that must be approved by a
majority of state legislatures
and two-thirds of Mexico's con-
gress. If enacted, they would not
be universal: Unemployment
insurance would apply only to
the roughly 40 percent of work-
ers with formal jobs, and the
new pensions would be for those
older than 65 earning less than
about $70 a month.
PRD head Jesus Zambrano
welcomed the fiscal reform, but
in a potential sign of trouble for
Pena Nieto, he warned that it
wouldn't lure his party'into sup-
porting private investment in oil
exploration or backing away from
demands for greater political
transparency, another potential
point of tension with the presi-
dent's party.
"This reform, these legal
reforms, aren't interchangeable
with any other, with political or
energy reform," Zambrano said.
"Quite simply, this stands by
itself."
Business groups and many
analysts said the fiscal proposal
did little to spread even some
of the burden for government
spending onto the majority of
Mexicans who work outside the
formal economic system.
The tax rate on workers earn-
ing more than $37,000 a year
would increase to 32 percent
from 30 percent under the fiscal
reform. The proposal would also
impose a 10 percent capital gains
and dividends tax. It would elimi-
nate a range of income tax deduc-
tions and limit overall deductions
to 10 percent of income.

More than half of
guidance counselor
staff remain
laid off
PHILADELPHIA (AP) -
The city's struggling public
sclhools opebed -new term
Monday with larger classes
and smaller staffs, leaving
many to wonder how the nearly
broke district will fare over the
coming year.
Superintendent William
Hite made the rounds at sev-
eral buildings to greet students
and employees. While contend-
ing that Philadelphia's schools
were prepared to open, he also
acknowledged how much they
were missing.
"We still want guidance ser-
vices in every school," Hite said.
"We need a lot more assistant
principals. We need a lot more
teachers. ... We need music the
full year. We need sports the full
year."
The morning bell capped
off weeks of turmoil in one of
the nation's largest districts,
as school supporters spent the
summer staging rallies and
pleading with city and state
officials for badly needed
funds. Hite even threatened to
delay opening day if he didn't
get $50 million to rehire suffi-
cient staff.
Earlier this year, the cash-
strapped system laid off nearly
3,800 workers - from assistant
principals to secretaries - as
rising labor costs, cuts in state
aid and charter school growth
helped create a $304 million
spending gap.
The district later recouped
about $33 million in costs and,
with the mayor's promise last
month of an extra $50 million,
was able to rehire about 1,650
employees. Even so, students
will get music and sports pro-

grams only for the fall semes-
ter.
One of the biggest issues is
the reduction in guidance coun-
selors. More than half remain
laid off, a major concern in a
system filled with immigrants,
low-income students and chil-
dren from unstable homes, not
to mention concerns about bul-
lying. r .
The full-time counselor at
C.W. Henry Elementary School
has been replaced by a roving
counselor who will visit the
building for just three hours
each week.
"That's simply not good
enough," said Robin Roberts,
who has three children at the
school.
At Bodine High School, teach-
er Kate Reber said college-bound
seniors now share a single advis-
er with 3,500 students across
several schools.
"I don't know who's going
to write their college counsel-
or recommendations," Reber
said.
Staff at Feltonville Inter-
mediate School posted a list
of resources they are missing,
including a counselor, an assis-
tant principal, several teachers
and 45 minutes of math instruc-
tion per day.
And at South Philadelphia
High School, where the super-
intendent ate lunch with a group
of students on Monday, class-
rooms were a tight squeeze. On

paper, about a dozen classes had
more than 33 students, and some
had more than 40, Principal
Otis Hackney said. However, he
noted actual attendance is hard
to judge until at least a week into
school.
The crowding comes as the
building absorbs hundreds of
students from Bok High School,
tineE f 24 schools closed in June
as the district sought to econo-
mize. Some closures mean longer
walks for young children, anoth-
er source of anxiety; others are
bringing together students from
rival neighborhoods.
The district tried to ease ten-
sions among Bok and South
Philly teens by sending about a
dozen on a summertime outdoor
retreat. Still, senior Devon Hen-
derson said he expects trouble.
"There's no telling what could
happen," he said.
Meanwhile, education advo-
cates are urging parents to docu-
ment any problems in official
complaints. They want to show
the state, which supplies the bulk
of the district's funding, that
the dearth of resources violates
Pennsylvania's mandate to pro-
vide a "thorough and efficient"
education.
The district, which serves
about 190,000 traditional and
charter school students, hopes
to recover additional money
through ongoing negotiations
with city, state and union lead-
ers.

BEIRUT (AP) - Those who
knew Bashar Assad in earlier days
say he was uncomfortable being
the son of a president and never
wanted to lead. A soft-spoken,
lisping eye doctor, he enjoyed
Western rock music and electron-
ic gadgets - an accidental heir to
power.
Yet Assad, who turns 48 on
Wednesday, has proven to be
relentlessly resilient, branded by
opponents a brutal dictator who
kills with chemical weapons.

His willingness to do what-
ever it takes in Syria's civil war,
unleashing his military's might
against entire towns and cities,
has so far succeeded in keeping
his regime core in power, even as
large swaths of his country fall
from his control or turn into dev-
astated killing fields.
Nearly three years into the
uprising against his family's more
than 40-year-rule, he has defied
every prediction that his end is
near.

The West once had the impres-
sion Assad was weak or incompe-
tent, said David Lesch, professor
of Middle Eastern history atcTrin-
ity University in San Antonio. "It
took this unleashing of violence
and bloodshed for people to reas-
sess their view of Bashar."
"There is revision, people say-
ing he's a lot tougher than they
thought," said Lesch, author of
"Syria: The Fall of the House of
Assad," who had unusual access
to Assad, meeting him regularly

from 2004-2009.
In the eyes of opponents,
Assad is a murderous autocrat
who would do anything to cling
to power. The U.S and its allies
accuse him of resorting to gas-
sing his own people, a claim the
regime denies.
But for his supporters, he is a
nationalist hero fighting West-
ern imperialism and ensuring
stable, secular rule in a turbu-
lent region wracked by sectar-
ian wars.

'Kiss' spins da

The Weeknd
branches out
beyond 'Trilogy'
By JACKSON HOWARD
Daily Arts Writer
The Weeknd had already
released three critically
acclaimed and, with the repack-
aged edition
titled Trilogy,B
commercially
successful Kiss Land
album-quality
projects in an The Weeknd
eight-month Republic
span in 2011.
Still, being that
it is backed by a major label, Kiss
Land serves as his official debut.
The most stark difference,
however, between Kiss Land and
the 30 songs contained on Trilogy
is not The Weeknd's subject mat-
ter or vocals, but the production.
On House of Balloons, Thursday
and Echoes ofSilence, The Weeknd
worked extensively with produc-
ers Illangelo and Doc McKin-
ney to create a hazy, mysterious,
bone-chilling sound that was as
much the producer's work as it
was The Weeknd's. On Kiss Land,
The Weeknd decided to bring ina
new group of producers; the rea-
soning as of now remains unclear.
What is clear, though, is The
Weeknd's evolution. Kiss Land,
as The Weeknd stated during his
press run, was greatly inspired
by the classic dystopian 1980s
film "Blade Runner," and more
than likely his new artistic vision
didn't mesh with the McKinney/
Illangelo style of old - a tragedy
considering the pure magic the
three managed to create on past
projects.
While the production on Trilo-
gy was glum, R&B-tinged despair,
the production here is schizo-
phrenic, filled with erratic strings
and echoing drums that certainly
recall Harrison Ford battling rep-
licants. Trilogy was a young man
discovering himself in the con-
text of his hometown of Toronto,
and though Kiss Land contains
the same angst and desperation,

"Better call Saul!"
it centers on The Weeknd's time
on the road, playing more like an
audible horror movie in the style
of John Carpenter and David
Cronenberg. "I went from sta-
rin' at the same four walls for 21
years / To seein' the whole world
in just 12 months" he sings on the
title track, and this transition -
of home to tour, of anonymity to
fame - rings free throughout Kiss
Land.
Though the sounds have
changed, the subject matter
remains generally the same. On
opening track "Professional," The
Weeknd sings to one of his favor-
ite subjects, a stripper, the track
panting "I love..." over and over
in deathbed-sounding breaths.
The first highlight of the album,
though, comes on "The Town,"
which, ironically, is the only song
not about tour life. Syncopated
claps and heavy bass carry his
floating vocals, which tell a story
of a woman who leaves him and
ultimately comes back. The best
part, though, is the traumatically
distorted breakdown - remi-
niscent of a glockenspiel - in
between verses that jolts the song
alive, proving that while The

BAD BOY
Pomp and circumstance
Innovative R&B
on 'Electric Lady'

Janelle Monie
continues robot
adventure story
By GREGORY HICKS
DailyArts Writer
Janelle Monie might be an
electric lady, but this gal is on
fire. The multi-Grammy-nom-
inated R&B
artist returns A
with a sequel to
her 2010 debut The Electric
album ArchAn-
droid, and back-
tracks the saga Janelle Monde
of Cindi May-
weather in this Bad Boy
prequel tale.
Monae devised
the sci-fi character of Mayweath-
er - an android on the run, in fear
of being disassembled - on her
debut EP, Metropolis, Suire it The
Chase, arod has expanded May-
weather's story ever since.
The Electric Lady's title choice
speaks more to the sci-fi tale than
the style of the record. While
there is an electronic presence felt
on most of the tracks, the album's

roots are wired deepest to classic
R&B. Further, the electric aura
is reminiscent of dainty disco,
not 2013's dirty dub. The orches-
tral atmosphere of the "Suite IV
Electric Overture" and "Suite
V Electric Overture" is some-
what unrelated to either of these
genres, but complements the
record as a plot device to a thriller
story, with both overtures bearing
a striking resemblance to a 007
film soundtrack.
The three album interludes
nurse the plot through a radio
disc-jockey show that's decep-
tively similar to a radio show
from the '60s, but with discus-
sion topics about androids and
the future. "Our Favorite Fugitive
(Interlude)" involves DJ Crash
Crash taking calls from listeners
to discuss various opinions of the
"favorite fugitive" Cindi May-
weather. The caller responses
within the interlude potentially
draw parallels to homosexuality
disputes of present day, in par-
ticular when a man howls, "Robot
love is queer!"
The Electric Lady's 19 tracks
would suggest excessive filler for
an R&B record, but the album

touches perfection at this length
in its endeavor to mirror a fantasy
film soundtrack. The generous
supply of songs works coherently
as each piece gradually shifts into
the next, making for few gaps
between tracks - a technique
exercised on Madonna's Confes-
sions on a Dance Floor album.
The glory is in the record
as an entity, but a few tracks
emerge as groovier than others.
"Q.U.E.E.N."'s heavy bassline and
"The Electric Lady" 's up-tempo,
percussive drive forge dance-
friendly tunes with a slice of con-
temporary in Solange and Erykah
Badu's rap collaborations.
In a modern-day sea of records
spat out to generate singles rev-
enue, this latest R&B creation
breaks free as an adventurous
tale intricately woven through a
multi-genre record. MonAe's pro-
ductions gradually garner more
attention as the years go by, and
with the attention bred from her
recent collaboration with fun. in
the three-time Grammy-nomi-
nated track "We Are Young," The
Electric Lady should have more
eyes and ears than any of Monae's
previous achievements.

Assessing the myth of

Arctic Monkeys create
darkly daringAM'

By JAKE OFFENHARTZ
For theDaily
I'm beginning to have my
doubts about this whole music'
criticism thing and, in turn,
have begun to question every-
thing about myself as a music
fan. This concerns me greatly
- as I'm sure it does you, empa-
thetic reader - and so let us now
dive into the catalyst of my dis-
tress.
Kanye West's Yeezus and
Deafheaven's Sunbather are my
two favorite albums of 2013. As
you probably already know, the
former is the sixth LP from one
of pop music's most divisive and
enduring figures. As you may
not know, the latter is the sopho-
more release from a previously
(mostly) unheard of San Fran-
cisco-based black metal out-
fit. Superficially, these albums
share nothing in common. Upon
closer examination however, the
two records of disparate genres
are not only related, but can
together illuminate a greater
truth about the current state of
music criticism.
According to Metacritic, a
website that weighs averages
from mainstream critics and
assigns normalized grades on a
100-point scale, Yeezus scored
an 85, while Sunbather earned
a whopping 92 - making it
the year's best-reviewed new
release.
So what's the issue here? My
two favorite albums this year
are nearly unanimously adored
by people who, like myself, write
about music. Accordingto Meta-
critic standards, both Yeezus
and Sunbather are "universally
acclaimed." I should be com-
forted in the warmth of collec-
tive appreciation, and normally I
would, if not for one minor tech-
nicality: It's complete and utter
bullshit.
Yeezus is less universally
agreed upon than a Syrian
ground invasion. My 17-year-
old sister likes it, a couple of my
indie-blog-reading friends like

Donuts
planned for
cakewalk
By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
Now, inevitably, comes the
letdown. A noon game against
Akron follows a night game
against Notre Dame. It's natural.
The Michigan football team
showed up ready for a game
against a weaker opponent in
Week 1 against
Central Michi- NOTEBOOK
gan. And they
may very well do that again
against Akron on Saturday, but
they will not be tested against
the Zips like they were against
the Fighting Irish.
And that's how it will go for
much of the next seven weeks
until a Nov. 2 game at Michigan
State kicks off the heart of the
Big Ten slate. This is the easiest
five-game stretch of Michigan's
schedule. The Wolverines will
likely be double-digit favorites in
each of those games should they
continue to win, with the pos-
sible exception of Penn State.
This stretch is about avoiding
disaster, and about improving for
a finishing stretch that includes
away games at Michigan State,
Northwestern and Iowa and two
at home against Nebraska and
Ohio State.
To wake up a groggy student
section, Michigan coach Brady
Hoke has promised a glazed-
donut giveaway.
"Well, it's a glazed-donut
game," Hoke said at his Mon-
day press conference. "Starts at
noon. We like those games. Our
team has been pretty focused on
ourselves and what we need to
do. Like I said, there's enough
out there that we need to do in
all three phases where we'll go
back and have a great workday
(Tuesday), and a great workday
on Wednesday."
So what specifically will
Michigan focus on?
First, Hoke said, is the inte-
rior line, the three new start-
ers Michigan has used this year.
Hoke was concerned about
Notre Dame's ability to blitz up
the middle to pressure redshirt
junior quarterback Devin Gard-
ner.
Michigan rushed for 166
yards, but many of those were
picked up on stretch plays to the
perimeter. That's not necessarily
a bad thing, and that was partly
due to Notre Dame's space-eat-
ing defensive interior. Still, Hoke
said, Michigan's ground attack

Catching up with
'M' fan 'Lloyd Brady'

Michigan coach Brady Hoke said a glazed-donut giveaway could entice students
to show up to games that start early, like Saturday's noon game vs. Akron.

must improve.
On the defensive side of the
ball, Michigan mnust prove it can
stop the run. Notre Dame coach
Brian Kelly dialed up pass plays
often on Saturday, but when he
ran, Notre Dame had success.
The Irish averaged 5.1 yards a
carry against Michigan, which
used a seven-man front. Michi-
gan would like to avoid using an
eighth man in the box, mean-
ing defenders have to show they
can win one-on-one battles with
blockers.
"You will be in some seven-
man fronts and really a five-man,
six-man box," Hoke said.
Akron, which spreads the
field, could show something.
BEHIND THE DEFENSIVE
NUMBERS: Michigan's defen-
sive performance against Notre
Dame wasn't pretty at times.
Notre Dame threw six easy
hitches for completions. The
Fighting Irish gained 410 total
yards. Notre Dame quarterback
Tommy Rees threw for 314 yards.
Some of that, Hoke revealed
Monday, was by design. Let's
start with what wasn't part of
the plan: Notre Dame, again, ran
the ball too easily. The pass rush
didn't generate enough pressure.
But Michigan's softer defen-
sive approach in the secondary
was meant to neutralize Rees'
strengths. And mostly, it did.
Those six easy hitches? The
coaching staff was prepared to
allow those to protect against the
long fade. And Michigan tackled
well enough to minimize yards
after the catch: Hoke said Notre
Dame gained just four yards after
the catch on those six passes.
"That was a big part of that
offense, but no coordinator is
going to sit there and throw sev-
en-yard hitches up and down the
field," Hoke said.

Hoke explained that the
Fighting Irish make sure Rees is
not under pressure. That means
using six men in protection or
using shorter routes. So instead
of dialing up blitzes, defen-
sive coordinator Greg Mattison
dropped more men in coverage.
Ideally, Michigan would have
the personnel and experience to
impose its defensive style on an
opponent. But for now, a good
barometer of success is the red
zone, where Notre Dame scored
just 60 percent of the time Sat-
urday.
"The field shrinks, so now it's
a little harder to find the room
in there," Hoke said. "I thought
we really played well in the red
zone when we had to. That was
playing the run with seven, and
making sure we had good depth
in the passing lanes."
INJURY UPDATE: Sophomore
tight end A.J. Williams went
down with an ankle injury Sat-
urday. Hoke said the team will
monitor his progress this week.
Hoke said he doesn't expect
any of the other injured players
to miss time. Fifth-year senior
wide receiver Jeremy Gallon
injured his hamstring in the
game, but he was able to play.
Senior safety Courtney Avery
was able to see limited action
against Notre Dame, and Hoke
said "that battle continues."
Hoke said Avery was able to
practice Wednesday and Thurs-
day, and felt good after playing
Saturday.
NOTABLE QUOTABLE: Hoke
was asked about Gardner's
decision-making, and if at times
his athleticism can give him a
"Superman complex."
"I think that's part of it," Hoke
said. "But Superman has to be
smart too. He doesn't eat Kryp-
tonite."

He's also a freshman football
coach at his alma mater, Saginaw
Nouvel Catholic Central.
Normal, except that Kazmier-
ski has strangers come up to him
almost everywhere he goes to
ask for a picture, not because of
anything he necessarily did, but
because of an Internet thread on
a popular fan blog three years
ago.
A MGoBlog.com user noticed
that Kazmierski looks a lot like
a cross between former Michi-
gan quarterback Tom Brady
and a character from the movie
"Dumb and Dumber" named
Lloyd Christmas.
And thus, Lloyd Brady was
born, spawning an unlikely rise
to Internet fame, the effects of
which Kazmierski is still feeling
today.
Monday, the Daily caught up
with Kazmierski.
The Michigan Daily: How's the
coaching going?
David Kzmierski: I coached
most of last year as well, helping
outwithbasketball andsoftball. I
enjoy it, giving back to my school
and teaching kids what I know.
I'm the offensive coordinator.
TMD: Did the ability to get
season tickets play into your
graduate school decision at all?
DK: It played a little bit in
thinking about it, but I always
wanted to keep pursuing having
my name on a Michigan degree.
That's a big deal for me. But get-
ting season tickets is definitely a
perk (laughs).
TMD: It's interesting to me
that you go from you know, you,
to this whole other character
that spawned out of just your
appearance and nothing that you
necessarily did.
DK: I was just going to the
game, having a good time and
enjoying myself. It's hard to
explain. I still get recognized
most places I go. I was walk-
ing around campus on Sunday,
and some kid just walked up to
me and said, "Hey Lloyd Brady,
how's it going?" The funniest one
from this weekend was that the
attendant at the top of the stairs
at the Notre Dame game said that
I looked a lot like Lloyd Brady. I
told him, "Well, I am." First time
I heard that one before.
TMD: It's funny that he said
you looked like Lloyd Brady
because-
DK: I know. Lloyd Brady isn't

VOLLEYBALL
Freshmen ready for big stage

By BEN FIDELMAN
For The Daily
With campus maps tucked
away inside a stiff, new back-
pack, lanyards dangling from
their necks and class schedules
firmly in hand, freshmen all
around campus are ready to tack-
le their first semester of college.
Now throw in evening practices,
expectations of Big Ten - if not
national - championships, along
with the new beast of college
schoolwork, and you'll get some
idea of what's facing freshmen
volleyball players Gabbie Bulic,
Abby Cole and Cindy Zhou.
While many Michigan athletes
attend summer term - which
allows them to practice as ateam
throughout the offseason - the
volleyball team has no such lux-
ury.
Players had about three weeks
to prepare for their first collegiate
matches, according to Michigan
coach Mark Rosen.
Despite such a short amount
of time to prepare, the Wolver-
ines already have a tournament
sweep under their belts, as well as
a sweep of Oregon State and No.
8 Oregon in last weekend's Big
Ten/Pac-12 Challenge.
of the three freshmen on the
roster, Cole has played the most
sets at 13. She also has the most
kills, 43, which is good for the
third highest total on the team.
Bulic has also gotten on the court
through the early parts ofthe sea-
son, totaling four sets played and
has chipped in 10 kills of her own.

Zhou plans to redshirt this year.
Because of the team's quick
start, it's easier for some to appre-
ciate their free time.
"Not coming (for summer
term) was a good thing for us,"
said Bulic, who plays middle
back. "Because we got our final
summer at home, but (as a con-
sequence) we have to jump right
into our season when we get
here."
While getting one last summer
at home has its advantages, mak-
ing up for a summer without prac-
tices does have its consequences.
"It's difficult, there's a lot of
training," said Cole, who also
plays middle back. "It wears
down your body for sure. I think
that was the toughest thing for
me. Coming in, I was really ner-
vous, I know the other two fresh-
men were as well, and the other
girls have helped make every-
thing so much easier."
This accelerated preseason
would be difficult for nearly every
freshman athlete, but these two,
plus Zhou, a setter, have been tak-
ing it in stride.
"All three really fit that mold
to be exactly what we are looking
for," Rosen said. "Not just to fill
our needs athletically, but to fit
academically, socially and cultur-
ally too."
These intangibles, along with
the class' physical size (only four
of the 16 players listed on the
roster are taller than any of the
freshmen) are reason enough for
Rosen to be chomping at the bit to
get the players on the court.

Rosen called the group
"incredibly tall" before pointing
out that both Bulic and Cole are
6 feet, 5 inches tall, and Zhou is
right around 6-foot - unusually
tall for a setter.
After the team graduated only
one senior from the 2012 squad
that made its first Final Four
appearance, expectations remain
high for the Wolverines.
"Some people say that it puts
more pressure on us, but I think
it's exciting to come in and play
with all those high expectations,"
Zhou said. "Because now we have
something to strive for - goals
that we want to meet."
Added Bulic: "Coaches and
the girls are really good with just
getting you in and making sure
you know what's going on and
adjusting. It's a lot faster than
high-school volleyball, but they
wouldn't put me in any situation
that they didn't think that I could
succeed in."
The season - and careers -
of these student athletes are just
starting, but there is a long road
ahead.
"This is really living the
dream," Zhou said. "I have people
come up to me and be like, 'Wow,
you're playing volleyball at a D-I
college, you're so lucky!' And
when you think about it, I really
am lucky to be here and to have
this opportunity."
Look for the freshman class
to continue impacting games as
the Wolverines travel to College
Station, Tex., for the Texas A&M
Invitational this weekend.
