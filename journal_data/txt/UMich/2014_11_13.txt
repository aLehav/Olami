GOING VIRAL

Democrats,
GOP disagree on
provisions to protect
gender identity
By SHOHAM GEVA
Daily StaffReporter
Sparking what was predicted
to be contentious topic in both
this year's lame duck session
of state legislature and beyond,
there are now two different ver-
sions of an amendment to the
state's Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights
Act up for consideration in Lan-
sing.
The act as it currently stands
protects state residents from
workplace, housing and other
forms of discrimination on the
basis of religion, race, color,
national origin, age, sex, height,
weight, familial status and mari-
tal status.
The first proposed amend-
ment, introduced concurrently
by Rep. Sam Singh (D-East Lan-
sing) in the House and by Sen.
Rebekah Warren (D-Ann Arbor)
in the Senate in September, pro-
poses new protections for to
include both sexual orientation
and gender identity or expression
as protected identities - a change

Democrats have unsuccessfully
sought multiple times over the
past few years.
Thessecond, introduced
Wednesday afternoon by Rep.
Frank Foster (R-Petoskey) in the
House, only proposes including
sexual orientation, and was met
with criticism from both LGBTQ
advocates and the Democratic
caucus.
Rep. Adam Zemke (D-Ann
Arbor), who co-sponsored Singh's
bill, said the main issue with Fos-
ter's proposal was his omission of
proposed protections for gender
identity and expression.
"The important thing that we
need to understand is that the bill
that was introduced by Rep. Fos-
ter is not a compromise," Zemke
said. "It's sending the message
that discrimination against one
group of people is okay as long as
we're protecting another group,
and that's not right."
Republicans in the state legis-
lature have argued that a recent
Equal Employment Opportu-
nity Commission ruling, which
found that discrimination against
transgender people qualifiedas
sex discrimination, could also
apply to the ELCRA, which they
say would effectively create
protections for gender identity.

On the outside of the glass,

On the inside, fingers drum

stop on the street, press their

Race & Ethnicity
req. next semester
By AMABEL KAROUB
Daily Staff Reporter
Beginning next semester,
students will officially be able
to minor in Intergroup Rela-
tions.
In addition to a formal minor
designation, an IGR class will
count for the University's Race
and Ethnicity requirement for
the first time.

IGR, now in its 26th year, is a
social justice program designed
to foster discussion and learn-
ing about social identity and
inequality. The program focus-
es on open discussions between
students, as well as promoting
leadership experience for the
students who facilitate these
discussions.
IGR's seven courses have
now been formalized into the
minor, complete with core
courses and multiple track
options to fulfill the require-
ments. The minor involves a
total of either eight or nine
classes and totals between 19
and 22 credits.
IGR Co-Director Kelly Max-

well said the minor emerged
in response to high student
demand. IGR previously
offered a Certificate of Merit
for studentswho took anumber
of IGR courses, but students
taking multiple classes in IGR
wanted their experience to
appear officially on their tran-
scripts.
Over the past year, IGR has
worked to develop a proposal
and curriculum for the minor,
which LSA approved this fall.
Maxwell said the timing is par-
ticularly ideal, adding that it's
becoming increasingly impor-
tant for students to commu-
nicate with others who have

Campus struggles
to meet goals for
waste, greenhouse
gas reductions
By GENEVIEVE HUMMER
Daily StaffReporter
University President Mark
Schlissel announced in a release
last week that the University
plans to review its sustainability
goals.
"To be the model public uni-
versity - and to be a responsible
leader in the communities we
serve - we must achieve our
full potential in sustainability,"
Schlissel wrote in a release.
The goals, established by
University President Emerita
Mary Sue Coleman in 2011,
included five operations-focused
sustainability goals: to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions, Uni-
versity transportation emissions
and waste tonnage, to purchase
sustainable food and to pro-
tect the Huron River. The year
2025 was set as the deadline for
achieving the goals.
Schlissel has recommended
working groups review the
University's progress on meet-
ing these goals and re-evaluate
future plans related to sustain-
ability.
Hank Baier, associate vice
president for facilities and oper-
ations, and Don Scavia, special
counsel to the president for sus-

tainability and director of the
'Graham Sustainability Institute,
will lead the process.
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily, Scavia said
Schlissel received a letter co-
signed by the leaders of 50
student organizations express-
ing their continued interest in
the 2011 sustainability goals,
which many of them helped to
create. In the letter, students
urged Schlissel to review the
existing goals and to enact
more aggressive initiatives. A
week or two later, he received a
similar letter from members of
the faculty.
Scavia said a review of the
sustainability goals was origi-
nally scheduled for next year,
but after receiving letters from
students and faculty, Schlissel
decided to conduct the review
this year.
"He thought it was impor-
tant as the new president to take
a look at it (the sustainability
goals) and he wanted definitely
to engage the operations staff
as well as faculty and students
to take a look at it collectively,"
Scavia said.
Three teams of faculty, stu-
dents and staff are now working
to schedule their first meetings.
One team will review green-
house gas emissions, another
waste reduction and the final
group will focus on the culture
of sustainability on campus.
While initiatives to improve
University transportation emis-
sions and purchase sustainable

food have seen success, oth-
ers have been more difficult to
accomplish.
Despite the 2011 goal to
reduce carbon gas emissions by
25 percent, University data pub-
lished by the Office of Campus
Sustainability show that emis-
sions decreased in 2012, but
then increased in 2013. Trans-
portation emissions have seen
decreases, but waste production
has actually increased since the
adoption of the goals.
"Greenhouse gas and waste
reduction are priorities because
those goals require the greatest
investment to achieve, and our
progress is not as rapid as we'd
like," Baier said in arelease.
Another goal of the review is
to educate students, faculty and
staff on campus about sustain-
ability.
Scavia said the Graham Sus-
tainability Institute has created
behavior change programs like
Planet Blue Ambassadors and
the Planet Blue Student Innova-
tion Fund to engage students in
current sustainability issues.
The institute also works with
the Institute for Social Research
to conduct an annual survey that
measures campus behaviors
and knowledge of sustainability
practices. The survey, which tar-
gets faculty, students and staff,
has run for two consecutive
years.
The survey conducted in 2012
found that while students were
more aware than faculty of cam-

FBI report
By NEALA BERKOWSKI
Daily StaffReporter
As reported by the FBI earlier
this week, Detroit had the high-
est rate of murder and violent
crimes in 2013.
Four offenses are categorized
as violent crime in the report:

murder, forcible rape, robbery
and aggravated assault. Out of
Detroit's699,889 residents, there
were 14,504 reported violent
crimes, or 2,072 violent crimes
per 100,000 people. Three hun-
dred and sixteen of those crimes
were murders, which is approxi-
mately 45 murders per 100,000
people. In contrast, Ann Arbor,
with a population of 116,799, saw
247 violent crimes in 2013, three
of which were murders.
Overall, however, violent
crime fell in the city and across
the nation. The estimated num-
ber of violent crimes in the U.S.

decreased by 4.1 percent, while
the estimated number of violent
crimes in Detroit decreased by 3
percent. Murders fell by18 per-
cent in Detroit and by 4.4 per-
cent nationwide.
Despite high crime rates in
Detroit, some University stu-
dents and student groups work-
ing in Detroit say these statistics
will not change their view of the
city, mainly because Detroit's
crime issues are not new to
them.

Student voter turnout
appears to drop in A2

0

Campus-surrounding
precincts report
lowerparticipation
By ANASTASSIOS
ADAMOPOULOS
Daily StaffReporter
As predicted,voter turnout for
the 2014 Midterm Elections was
relatively low this election year
with no presidential race to bring
people to the polls. On top of that,
it appears even turnout on cam-
pus is on the decline.
Within the Washtenaw Coun-
ty precincts that surround cam-
pus, where students tend to live,
average voter turnout per pre-
cinct was 14.08 percent this year,
down from 17.88 percent in 2010,
the last non-presidential election
year.
In reality, it is likely that a

living in these areas voted as the
number of registered voters is
inflated by individuals who are
registered in Ann Arbor, but have
since moved away, like former
students. These individuals can
remain registered in Ann Arbor
for years before being removed.
The figures also do not account
for students who voted by absen-
tee ballot in their home district.
Associate History Prof. Mat-
thew Lassiter said though the
decline in voters is unfortunate,
it is common for younger voters
to be less involved in midterm
elections than presidential ones.
"I think that most students
believe that being active through
political parties is less effective
then being active through issue
based organizations and it's hard
to argue with that analysis," Las-
siter said.
LSA junior Trevor Dolan, pres-
ident of the University's chapter

larger percentage of students of the College Democrats, said
H- -,

there is a small group of politi-
cally active students, despite the
broader trend of declining par-
ticipation. He said while many
may be passionate about certain
issues, fewer are willing to get
involved in the political process.
He added that being a member
of College Democrats allows him
to work on the issues he cares
about.
"Single issues are important
but by involving yourself in the
Democratic or Republican par-
ties you show thatyou care about
a series of issues," he said.
Dolan said College Democrats
have 40 to 50 members who con-
sistently show up to meetings,
and many more come sporadi-
cally. He said he believes politi-
cal organizations have failed to
show that they can accomplish
their goals, many perceiving par-
ties to be solely focused on win-
ning. He added that because of
this, students instead choose to
join issue-based organizations
instead.
"Politics is just composed of
all these issues, and I think that
when a lot of students think of
politics they think about ger-
rymandering, they think about
political gridlock but they don't
think about that what happens
in Washington or what happens
in Lansing affects them directly
and affects the issues that they
care about," Dolan said.
Political Science Prof. Nicho-
lasValentino said research shows
that college students tend to be
less partisan while in school,
usually identifying and work-
ing with one party later on. He
said Democratic and Republican
party organizers have worked
harder recently to recruit col-
lege students through grassroots
mobilization.
"I think if you wanted to make
just the most basic prediction
about whether someone is going
to participate, the first thing you
usually look to is how much did
their family participate and how

President issuing
series of executive
orders this month
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi-
dent Barack Obama is poised
to act soon to unveil a series of
executive actions on immigration
that will shield possibly around 5
million immigrants living in the
country illegally from deporta-
tion, according to advocates in
touch with the White House.
The estimate includes extend-
ing deportation protections to
parents and spouses of U.S. citi-
zens and permanent residents
who have been in the country
for some years. The president is
also likely to expand his 2-year-
old program that protects young
immigrants from deportation.
Timing of the announcement
is unclear, though it's expected
before the end of the year. White

House Press Secretary Josh Ear-
nest said Obama would review
final recommendations after
returning from his Asia trip next
week.
Congressional Republicans
are strongly opposed to Obama's
plans, and as lawmakers returned
to Capitol Hill this week follow-
ing midterm elections in which
the GOP retook the Senate, they
vowed to oppose him.
"We're goingto fight the presi-
dent tooth andnail ifhecontinues
down this path. This is the wrong
way to govern. This is exactly
what the American people said on
Election Day they didn't want,"
House Speaker John Boehner,
R-Ohio, said Thursday. "And so,
all the options are on the table."
Some conservatives in the
House and Senate announced
plans to push for language in
must-pass spending bills to block
the president from acting. But
other Republicans warned that

such a push could result in anoth-
er government shutdown like the
one last year over Obama's health
care plan.
"My sense is that the vast
majority of us want to do every-
thing we can to stop it, but also
want to avoid outcomes that
would prove bad for the coun-
try as a whole," said Sen. Marco
Rubio, R-Fla. It wasn't clear,
though, what other options
Republicans had.
The advocates, who spoke on
condition of anonymity ahead
of a public announcement, said
that final details of the plan
remained in flux. But the White
House is likely to include parents
and spouses of U.S. citizens and
permanent residents, stipulating
that they've resided in the U.S. for
some period of time - possibly
as little as five years. That group
totals around 3.8 million people,
according to the Migration
Policy Institute.
and waste and those sorts of
things, is that you can do a lot
with technology, but chang-
ing behavior on campus is
going to be a really important
part of reaching those goals,"
he said.

Speaker of the House John Boehner, left, and Rep. Greg Walden meet with reporters on Capitol Hill to discuss
immigration reforms President Barack Obama is ready to release through executive action.

Jury indicts Ex-CEO of coal
mine that exploded, killing 29

Executive charged
with numerous
counts of conspiracy
CHARLESTON, W.Va.
(AP) - Don Blankenship, the 1
steely-eyed executive once
dubbed "The Dark Lord of Coal
Country," on Thursday became
the highest-ranking coal offi-
cial to face federal charges in
the nation's deadliest mine
disaster in 40 years. 1
A federal grand jury indict-
ed the former Massey Energy t
CEO on numerous counts of i
conspiracy in the April 2010 u
underground explosion that
killed 29 men at the Upper t
Big Branch Mine in Montcoal, p
West Virginia.
The 43-page indictment said t
Blankenship "knew that UBB s
was committing hundreds of 1
safety-law violations every year
and that he had the ability to
prevent most of the violations G
that UBB was committing. Yet t
he fostered and participated
in an understanding that per- k
petuated UBB's practice of rou- F
tine safety violations, in order k
to produce more coal, avoid the
costs of following safety laws,
and make more money."
His attorney, William W.
Taylor III, said in a statement F
that Blankenship "is entirely t
innocent of these charges. He 1
will fight them and he will be i
acquitted."
"Don Blankenship has been a
tireless advocate for mine safe-
ty," the statement said. "His p
outspoken criticism of power-
ful bureaucrats has earned this
indictment. He will not yield to t
their effort to silence him. He
will not be intimidated." k
But Pam Napper, whose son,
WRITEATHON
From PageA A
Jeremiah Chamberlin, assis-
tant director of the English
Department Writing Program
and editor-in-chief and pub-
lisher of Fiction Writers Review,
sat down for an interview with
The Michigan Daily, to discuss
the writing process and how the
Write-a-thon expands on that
process.
"Writing is normally thought of
as a very solitary act. When some-
one says 'writer,' they envision
someone alone, in a room, often
a garret, in some sort of mental
anguish or wonderful ecstasy as
the muse either speaks or does not
speak to them," Chamberlin said.
"And so I think it's important to
remember that writing is a collab-
orative act, and it's a community
act. While we do spend a large
portion of our day writing at that
desk or at that tablet by ourselves,
almost every writer I know shares
their work."
For writers, the Write-a-thon
is a means to validate their ambi-
tions and connect with other
writers in the Ann Arbor area.
Drafting is a struggle, but at least
they can struggle together.

"I really love the idea of writers
coming together for the shared
endeavor. It's a kind of solidar-
ity. It's a kind of making public
what's often a solitary act ... It's
reaffirming, to share a room with
a dozen or twenty people who are
all engaged in that act," Chamber-
lin said.
And in Espresso's tiny seating
area, hundreds of new ideas will
be simmering in the air above the
writers' heads, electrifying the
already charged atmosphere.
"I also love the notion that, in
this space, there are new poems,
new stories, new plays, new nov-
els, all being generated simulta-
neously ... And I think it inspires
people," Chamberlin said.
From 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Friday,
through Espresso's window front,
Ann Arborites can see writers
bringing novels, poems and plays
to life, just a plane of glass sepa-
rating chilly sidewalk strollers
from the architects of tomorrow's
O classic tales.
"By making it in the front win-
dow of Espresso Royale, everyone
who walks by looks in and sees
writers, and they see writers at
work. And they'll see writers on

Josh Napper, was among the
miners who died that day, said
"it's about time" Blankenship
was called to account.
"He was a big part of this,"
she said. "He knew what was
going on in that mine and con-
tinued to let it go. I hope he gets
what he deserves. I am so excit-
ed. They aren't sad tears today.
They're happy tears."
Earlier this year, Blanken-
ship sponsored and appeared
in a 50-minute documentary
titled "Upper Big Branch -
Never Again." In it, he argued
that regulators never got to the
truth about what happened
underground.
"If someone wants to know
the truth about what hap-
pened at UBB, they need to go
ubbneveragain.com and watch
the documentary," Blanken-
ship, in his signature even
baritone, told MSNBC's Chris
Hayes early last month.
But U.S. Attorney Booth
Goodwin said the truth is con-
tained in the indictment.
In February 2013, a former
longtime subordinate, David
Hughart, testified that Blan-
kenship ordered the wide-
spread corporate practice of
warning coal miners about
surprise federal inspections.
The federal Mine Safety and
Health Administration said
the root cause of the blast was
Massey's "systematic, inten-
tional and aggressive efforts"
to conceal life-threatening
problems. MSHA said manag-
ers even maintained two sets of
pre-shift inspection books - an
accurate one for themselves,
and a sanitized one for regula-
tors..
The indictment says Blan-
kenship conspired to violate
standards at the mine from

January 2008 until April
2010, when the explosion tore
through the tunnels.
The explosion prompted fed-
eral officials to begin monthly
"impact" inspections at prob-
lem mines throughout Appa-
lachia in addition to routine
state and federal visits. MSHA
said last month that it has con-
ducted 823 "impact" inspec-
tions sites and issued more
than 13,000 citations since the
explosion.
Alpha Natural Resources
bought Massey for $7.1 bil-
lion in June 2012. Blankenship
retired ahead of the merger.
"We can only hope that the
outcome of the upcoming pro-
ceedings that were announced
today will provide some level
of comfort and closure for the
families of the fallen miners
and to the larger community
where we live and operate,"
Alpha said in a statement.
Four investigations into
the disaster found that worn
and broken cutting equipment
created a spark that ignited
accumulations of coal dust
and methane gas. Broken and
clogged water sprayers allowed
what should have been a minor
flare-up to become an inferno.
Blankenship started a blog
to push his assertion that the
presence of natural gas in the
mine, and not methane gas and
excess coal dust, was at the
root of the explosion. He said
getting to that "truth" was "the
best way to honor the victims
of Upper Big Branch..."
In the November 2010 Roll-
ing Stone article in which
the "dark lord" moniker was
coined, Jeff Goodell described
the former $18 million-a-year
man as "the undisputed king of
coal in West Virginia."

"Other Big Coal CEOs who'
operate in Appalachia are
business-school types who
have offices in other states
and leave the dirty work to
their minions," he wrote.
"Blankenship, by contrast, is a
rich hillbilly who believes that
God put coal in the ground so
that he could mine it, and any-
one - or any law - that stands
in his way needs to be beaten
down, bought off or tied up in
court.
"Blankenship is hated,
feared and respected, but
nobody wants to tangle with
him."
Until now. If convicted,
Blankenship could face up to 31
years in prison.
Others have been convicted
in the case. Former White Buck
Coal Co. President Hughart,
who testified that Blankenship
ordered the inspection warn-
ings, pleaded guilty to federal
conspiracy charges. Hughart,
who never worked at Upper Big
Branch, was eventually sen-
tenced to 3 1/2 years in prison
for his role.
Former UBB superinten-
dent Gary May was sentenced
last year to one year and nine
months in prison on charges
he defrauded the government
through his actions at the
mine, including disabling a
methane gas monitor and falsi-
fying records. May cooperated
with prosecutors.
He testified at the Febru-
ary 2012 sentencing of former
Massey security chief Hughie
Elbert Stover, who was sent to
prison for three years for lying
to investigators and ordering a
subordinate to destroy docu-
ments. It was one of the stiff-
est punishments ever handed
down in a mine safety case.

RIGHTS
From Page 1A
groups have strongly contested
that interpretation.
Several cities and public
institutions within Michigan,
including Ann Arbor and the
University, have amended their
own ordinances and policies
to include both gender identity
and expression and sexuality,
but these changes are relatively
isolated, making amending the
act on the state level a focus for
many LGBTQ groups.
"The ability to be fired just
because of who you are is bigger
than just a theoretical debate,"
said Jason Morgan, co-chair of
the Jim Toy Community Cen-
ter's Public Policy committee.
"It's a very real issue for people.
And there are people who've
been fired for being gay. So it's
not just about the broader civil
rights discussion. There is a very
real, tangible impact on the lives
of people to be protected that is
necessary."
Foster, who will lose his seat at
the end of the lame duck legisla-
tive session in December, intro-
duced his revised amendment
with the backing of Speaker of
the House Jase Bolger (R-Mar-
shall), who previously stated he
did not support Singh or War-
ren's bills.
Bolger introduced a third bill
along with Foster's, the Michi-
gan Religious Freedom Resto-
ration Act, that parallels a 1993
federal legislation which per-
mits broad exemptions to fed-
eral laws if they conflict with an
individual's religious beliefs. In
a statement, Bolger said the act's
passage would be necessary for
him to allow Foster's bill to come
to avote.
"I have been researching this
issue for well over a year and
said repeatedly that I would
work on finding legislation that
could strike a balance between
protecting personal liberties and
defending religious freedom,"
Bolger said. "I believe Rep. Frank
Foster's bill on Elliott Larsen and

my bill on MiRFRA provide that
necessary balance."
His stance was applauded by
the Michigan Catholic Confer-
ence, which represents Roman
Catholic bishops in the state, as
an important expression of reli-
gious tolerance.
However, both the state
Democratic caucus and various
LGBTQ advocacy groups indi-
cated they would not support
Foster's bill, and condemned the
additional legislation concerning
religious exemptions.
In an interview Wednesday
morning, before Foster's bill
was announced, Rep. Jeff Irwin
(D-Ann Arbor), who co-spon-
sored Singh's bill, said religious
exemptions had the potential to
reduce the impact of the ELCRA.
"It's really opening up the
biggest possible loophole in our
anti-discrimination laws," Irwin
said. "Because much of the dis-
crimination that people face, if
not based on religion, is justified
by religious scripture."
Following the introduction of
Foster and Bolger's bills Wednes-
day, a coalition of LGBTQ advo-
cacy groups announced they
would beginexploringnon-legis-
lative pathways, such as a ballot
question, to get the original ver-
sion of the amendment passed.
Irwin said any proposed
amendments that didn't include
gender identity and expression,
or came tied to potential reli-
gious exemptions, had the poten-
tial to halt the momentum built
up around the issue -in Lansing
over the past few years.
"If this is something we're
going to do in a bipartisan way,
with some folks from both sides
- though probably more votes
from Democrats in support - it's
got to be something that Demo-
crats actually support," Irwin
said. "A bill that is not fully
inclusive, that leaves the most
persecuted and the most dis-
criminated part in this commu-
nity behind and that really opens
up a loophole for discrimination
against gay and lesbian people,
that will not be the kind of pol-
icy I think that progressives are
going to'rally behind."

He also stressed that you don't
need to be a seasoned writer to
stop in on Friday; all are welcome
to find a table, plug in their lap-
top and write that first sentence,
regardless of confidence or skill
level.
"Every single writer will tell
you that every time he or she
starts a new project, it's as if
they're learning to write for the
first time. Every novelist will tell
you that while one gains more
confidence with each book and
learns a few tricks along the way,
every project has its own unique
challenges," Chamberlin said.
"So it's just as likely that the
award-winning author sitting
next to you is having just as much
problems."
From renowned faculty to
seasoned lecturers, from MFA
students to Creative Writing Sub-
concentrators, from freshman
trying their hand at English 223 to
that guy in your physics class who
likes Sci-Fi, Espresso will house a
catalog of writers for all 10 hours,
each completely absorbed with
the tedious, mind-eroding writing
process, rather than the output.
And all are welcome.
"People can stop in for fifteen
minutes, write a note on the type-
writer, or they can stay for a few
hours and really work away at
something ... I would remind all
writers, myself included, that it's
the process of doing the work that
matters most and the process of
exploration that happens on the
page," Chamberlin said.
First instituted in Ann Arbor in
2009, the Write-a-thon is a chance
for Ann Arbor's writers to sip cof-
fee, nibble a donut and tap their
keyboard a few thousand times
until something remarkable hap-
pens. For 10 hours on Friday, head
down to Espresso on State Street,
find a table near the front and
inhale the aroma of hot chocolate,
sweaty palms and blind determi-
nation.
The November Write-a-thon
is for the writers, all of them.
Whether you're a Hopwood win-
ner or you don't know what that
is, wander over to Espresso on Fri-
day. Even if you've never touched
a keyboard, there's still plenty of
reason to join.

MINOR
From Page 1A
different identities.
"Students want opportuni-
ties for interaction across dif-
ferent groups - not just race,
but other identities as well,
and they get that in IGR," she
said.
LSA senior Sarah Berkman
has already expressed interest
in completing the new minor.
As a Community Action and
Social Change minor, Berk-
man has already fulfilled most
of the credits required for the
IGR minor. Berkman said CAS
was their only option for stu-
dents wanting to have a minor
dealing with social justice.
Now, students can explore
both IGR and CAS and decide
which minor is right for them.
"There are a lot of people in
IGR dialogues and facilitating
classes who decide to become
CAS minors because a lot of
the IGR classes fulfill CAS,"
she said. "I think maybe some
of those people now would do
the IGR minor."
While IGR administra-
tors were structuring the
new minor, they also planned
to have an IGR class count
for LSA's Race & Ethnic-
ity requirement. The class
counting for credit is Inter-
group Dialogues, listed as
UC/PSYCH/SOC122. The
course is three credits and it
is one of two core classes for
the IGR minor. However, the
class is open to any student
and the course will fulfill the

RE requirement regardless
of whether or not a student
wants to minorin IGR.
Last year, members of the
Black Student Union lobbied
the University to enact a Race
and Ethnicity requirement in
every school and college.
In response, former CSG
President Michael Proppe
said the University should
consider allowing IGR classes
to fulfill Race and Ethnicity
requirements. The comments
were delivered at a meeting
of the University's Board of
Regents shortly after the BSU
launched their #BBUM cam-
paign.
Maxwell said the only rea-
son the course didn't previ-
ously count for RE is because
it was only two credits, and a
course must be at least three
credits to be considered. IGR
was considering changing
the course anyway because
facilitators were commenting
that two hours a week was not
enough time for meaningful
dialogue. Due to the changes
that came with the minor,
Maxwell said it was a good
time to increase the course's
credit hours.
"With the changing demo-
graphic of our society, by
2042, there won't be a major-
ity racial group in the United
States," Maxwell said. "We
have to be in a position to be
able to understand cultural
differences and be able to
communicate inter-culturally
in a way that acknowledges
both the cultures that we
come from and people from
other groups."


VOTING

many socio-economic and skills
based resources to know how to
participate," Valentino said.
LSA junior Kayla Garthus,
vice-president of the University's
chapter of the Young Americans
for Liberty, joined the organiza-
tion during her freshman year
and said the diversity of the
members has increased in the
time she joined.
Young Americans for Liberty
is a non-partisan libertarian
organization that had 150 chap-
ters nationwide at the end of
2009. That number has increased
to 527 today.
Garthus said the organiza-
tion has a mixture of people with
different identities, including
Republicans and Democrats. She
believes that nonpartisanship
has helped the group expand.
"I would say that people are
less inclined nowadays to be
so politically active due to the
unfortunate circumstances
involving the government and
just political parties," Garthus
said.
LSA senior Sarah Cunning-
ham, secretary of the Uni-
versity's chapter of College
Republicans, said the group is
steadily growing stronger and
the midterm elections have
helped the group gain some
attention on campus.
She said students often do not
participate in politics because,
among other. things, they are
busy with other priorities.

"A lot of students that I've met
maybe stray away form being
super-involved in political par-
ties because they feel that they
have become more polarized
or that current representatives
don't represent their beliefs. And
I think that's even more reason
to get involved," Cunningham
said.
Business senior Elena Bren-
nan, a senior adviser for the Col-
lege Republicans, said she does
feel that political parties are
becoming less popular among
young people.
"The College Republicans here
at U of M have actually adapted
to this by creating a 'Students
For' position on the board that
heads up committees focused on
specific issues that are relevant
to students - issues that we
care about looking towards our
futures," Brennan said.
Like the College Democrats,
the College Republicans has
roughly 50 members that show
up consistently, Brennan said.
Cunningham said another
basic determinant for political
involvement is being able to con-
duct a dialogue. She said when
students openly identify with a
political party, other students
assume they will not be open to
new ideas.
She added that another fac-
tor that keeps students involved
with a political group are the
friends they make there. As a
freshman, Cunningham was an
independent but she said she
found a lot in common with Col-
lege Republicans and identified
with her peers rather than politi-
cians themselves.


DETROIT
From Page 1A
Detroit and has family in the
city, said these statistics did
not change her perspective of
Detroit and she will continue to
visit family.
"Because I already knew it
was kind of a dangerous place,
I don't think this has changed
my perception," she said. "The
crime is kind of why we left in
the first place but we still go
visit almost every weekend."
Members of Crowd 313 - a
student organization focused
on bringing students to Detroit

for various cultural events and
exposing them to cultural and
economic aspects of the city -
said statistics like these have
motivated them to show stu-
dents that Detroit is stilla place
worth visiting.
"Crime is a big city phe-
nomenon, it has obvious cor-
relations to less affluent areas,"
said Architecture sophomore
Olivia Howard, a Crowd 313
member. "It doesn't necessar-
ily mean that everyone is more
likely to encounter crime if
they go to Detroit and I don't
think it makes the culture any
less rich or the communities
any less strong."
According to the Detroit

News, Detroit was followed
by New Orleans, Newark, St.
Louis and Baltimore in terms
of murder rates. The FBI does
comparative crime statistics
for U.S. cities with crime rates
per 100,000 people.
LSA freshman Kevin Zhang
agreed that the statistics on
crime in Detroit will not make
him less likely to go to Detroit
to watch the Tigers, Lions or
Red Wings, or events like the
North American International
Auto Show.
"The statistics impacted my
perception negatively, obvi-
ously, but I think I already had
a negative of view of the city in
terms of violent crime, so it just

confirms sort of what I already
thought," he said.
LSA senior Lauren Kissel
shared the feelings of other
students who have visited
Detroit for cultural events or
volunteer opportunities, say-
ing she does not think crime in
Detroit will impact the activi-
ties they attend in the city.
"The statistics definitely
kind of makes me wary, but
I think the places I would be
going to like the DIA or vol-
unteering would probably be
more safe," she said. "The sta-
tistics did not really change my
view of the city because I kind
of already knew crime was a
problem there."

The road to recovery
Detroit's emergence from bankruptcy shows glimmers of hope
etroit has struggled for more than half of a century
to revitalize itself. Precipitous population drops,
abandoned homes, rampant crime and the auto
industry's previous struggles has put the city in financial
turmoil. In March 2013, Republican Gov. Rick Snyder appointed
Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr, a University alum, to help
Detroit put the city on a stronger financial footing. A few months
later, in June 2013, the city filed for bankruptcy. Over the past
year, concerns over the possibility of the city's multimillion-
dollar art collection being sold and the loss of pensions for
retirees came to the forefront of national discussion. In order
to protect pensions and the city's art collections, state and
non-state actors collaborated on a plan to get Detroit out of
bankruptcy. This plan is a great start for Detroit's renewal, but
city officials and state legislators cannot allow apathy to set in
as a continued push is needed to rebuild the once great city.

the increase in applicantsto a school
with newfound athletic success is
called the "Flutie Effect," named
after the increase in admissions to
Boston College after quarterback
Doug Flutie's Hail Mary win in
1984 over the University of Miami
(althoughthe correlationinthis spe-
cific instance is disputed). Such an
effect is also said to have occurred at
George Mason and Butler after their
NCAA basketball tournament runs,
Appalachian State after its victory
over Michigan in 2007, and Boise
State, Northern Iowa and Auburn
after recent football successes.
Michigan itself was even a
launching point for the commercial-
ization of college athletics with the
marketing juggernaut that was the
Fab Five. Athletic royalties spiked
from $2 million in 1990-91 to $6.2
million in 1993-94, the Fab Five's
last season. The number of applica-

tions even climbed from 17,744 in
1991 to 19,687 in 1996, a 36-percent
climb that then Director of Admis-
sions Ted Spencer was reluctant to
correlate specifically to athletics,
but noted that in his own personal
experience many students were
drawn to the University because
of them.
Until there are enough negative
externalities to warrant changing
the system (which may not be far
off with the danger of concussions),
college sports will continue to be an
extremely marketable enterprise.
Yet the consequences of this
enterprise interfering with the
academic missions of the NCAA and
its institutions will continue to be
a contentious issue without a total
reshaping of the culture and role of
college athletics.
Schlissel may have apologized
and clarified some of his remarks,

but his remarks on the role of ath-
letics within the University show
a willingness to make Michigan a
leader in redefining what college
athletics look like. The NCAA will
look incredibly different as soon as
the next decade, perhaps with play-
ers being paid, a renewed empha-
sis on academics and graduation or
by any other number of significant
reforms that will be necessary for
the NCAA. Despite current issues, it
is clear that there is a place for col-
lege athletics and that much value
that can come from them. Michigan
must be at the forefront in defining
the rightrolefor athleticswithinthe
context of the University's mission,
and also as a leading institution in
shaping the inevitably changing
landscape of the NCAA.

Dressing like a woman

Nov. 7, Judge Steven Rhodes approved
Detroit's exit plan, allowing the city to end its
historic bankruptcy. The plan - dubbed the
"Grand Bargain" - was crafted by numerous
community members from local foundations,
the state government, city pensioners, the
Detroit Institute of Arts and the Detroit Water
and Sewage Department. The deal reduces
Detroit's debt by $7 billion, keeps the DIA's art
collection intact, cuts 12,000 non-public safety
retirees' pensions by 4.5 percent and pledges
$1.7 billion for the demolition of blighted
buildings. Thanks to the collaborative effort
of various organizations, the city and state
government and Orr, residents now have a
feasible plan for Detroit's future.
This exit plan includes a number of key
points that will greatly benefit the city. The.
long-maligned streetlight system, that at one
point had 40 percent of its lights broken, will
undergo a $185-million overhaul, replacing
the antiquated system with 65,000 LED
streetlights. The city was provided with 100
new Detroit Police Department squad cars and
23 new ambulances, which will aid in further
decreasing average EMS response times. These
response averages have already decreased
from 58 minutes to 18 minutes for police and to
12 minutes for ambulances. With an increased
operating budget, the DPD has focused on
hiring non-uniformed administrative staff
in order to move uniformed officers off of
desk-duty and back onto the streets. The plan
envisions spending about $400 million on
blight removal. The Duggan administration
is also aiming to demolish about 800 houses
per month. With all the whirlwind of the
bankruptcy, the major success of the process
was the protection of the DIA. The museum
was transferred into a charitable fund during
bankruptcy and, in the exit plan, was granted
autonomy from city ownership, protecting the
collection from any further attempts at sale or
liquidation. The exit plan gives the city new

hope: with city services improving, emergency
services average response times declining and
the treasured DIA saved, Detroit is moving
down the path of recovery.
While these steps are commendable,
further steps are needed to ensure Detroit's
continued economic revitalization. The
Financial Review Commission needs to do
a more thorough job going forward so the
that the city makes stable, sound, long-term
investments and tax collection is efficient
and effective. According to a Detroit News
analysis, taxes were completely collected
on just 53 percent of non-exempt Detroit
properties. Even fewer saw timely payment.
If the city is going to maintain and improve'
its infrastructure, an effective strategy of
collecting taxes and a system to work with
residents having difficulty with payment will
be needed. Further,the city has a responsibility
to ensure that economic improvements spread
outward and aren't to comparatively wealthier
areas. This might create a dichotomous and
tense social situation, and could negatively
affect long-term stability, a requisite for
sustainable economic growth. Moreover,
pushes for voter education and registration
and increasing voter turnout might also
promote civic engagement and governmental
stability. Finally, as the population of the city
is substantially lower than it was at its peak,
Detroit should recognize that reversing the
mass exodus from the city is a key component
to its growth.
With the approval of its bankruptcy plan,
Detroit has been granted a rare second chance
and a pointed direction for growth. However
thankful the city may be, this is not the
time to relax. While Detroit's exit plan does
address a number of crucial problems, there
are still numerous obstacles to overcome. The
previous failures that led to this point cannot
be repeated, and all those involved must be
fully dedicated to Detroit's rebirth.

hen I was four, I always
wanted to wear this
patterned T-shirt that
had basketballs, tennis balls, base-
balls and footballs
printed on the
front and back. I
took every oppor-
tunity to put it
on, dirty or clean,
which my mother
found appalling.f
She had bought
it for me without JENNY
much thought, WANG
imagining that
I'd wear it only
at night, in the privacy of our home.
During the day, of course, she would
dress me up in pink and frills, with a
red bow clipped onto my short hair.
I'm not sure why I loved that shirt
so much. I'm also not sure why the
first item of clothing I'd ever picked
out at a department store was a pair
of gray sweat pants from the boys'
section (maybe it was the amazingly
gigantic pockets). Igrew up watching
Pokdmon and Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles, collecting Yu-Gi-Oh cards,
wearing large-sized T-shirts I got
from playing tennis. My mother
often joked to me, "Things would be
so much easier if you were born aboy.
I wonder what happened."
But I did not, and I still do not,
consider myself to be a "boy." I've
always been a girl, and I've never
been uncertain of my "girlhood." For
some reason or another, I simply felt
uncomfortable in "girly" clothing. In
middleschool, my mother introduced
me to "skinny jeans" and suggested
I have "long hair," all to my horror.

In high school, when my peers were
more free to express their developing
bodies through their clothing, I wore
big sweatshirts that flattened my
chest and baggy pants that hid my
butt. "How," my mother would plead,
"are you ever going to get a boy to
notice you?"
I'm approaching that stage in
my life when calling myself a "girl"
draws puzzled looks. I hear them
thinking, "Don't you mean woman?"
and I'm not sure how to answer,
because for my whole life, I've lived
comfortably in the more ambiguous
"girl" category. What, after all, is
a woman? Isn't she supposed to be
white, heterosexual, beautiful, slim
and tall (but not taller than her man)?
Doesn'tshe have an hourglass figure,
strutting down the sidewalk like it's
her runway, her perfect hair bobbing
and flowing in the breeze? Where
exactly do I fit in that image?
These musings have recently
sprung to my mind for two reasons.
The first being my mother's recent
talks about the "M-word." I should
be married by the time I'm 26, she
says. I should have my first child
by 28. I should have at least two
children. I should make myself look
more attractive to men. I should be
searching seriously while I have the
time, because after I graduate, I won't
be surrounded by as many people as
I am on-campus. These suggestions
have, to say the least, caused some
unnecessary anxiety.
The second reason comes as a
much more welcomed and pleasant
surprise. The Central Student Gov-
ernment has been working to expand
the University's non-discrimination

policy to include "sexual expres-
sion." If implemented, we'll be see-
ing "sexual expression" receiving
protections alongsidethe manyother
identities we all carry: race, national
origin, age, sex, sexual orientation,
gender identity, gender expression,
disability, religion, etc. I think, how-
ever, while race, gender identity and
sexual orientation are usually at the
forefront of identity politics (and
rightfully so), we should also pay
more attention to sexual expression
and gender expression, and how they
tie into each of our lives.
Sexual expression describes not
just the sexual activities we engage
in, but also how we present ourselves
as sexual beings. How we dress, talk
and behave all factor into this, Along
the same lines, gender expression
deals with how we present ourselves
within expected gender roles. I think
it's pretty clear that while these two
concepts are distinct, they are also
very closely related to each other.
How I dress dictates how I "show
off" both of these identities.
In the mornings, I put on a T-shirt,
a thin jacket and a pair of jeans. I tie
my hair into a ponytail and brush
my bangs to the sides. As I leave my
apartment, I slip on my gray overcoat
and step into my sneakers. I tend to
walk briskly, especially when it's cold
outside, hands buried in my pockets.
Sometimes,-Iworrywhat people think
of me when I pass them by, but then I
see all the people around me - the dif-
ferent ways they dress, walk and talk
- and feel just a little more at home.

athletics in the news for something
other than a win-loss record or the
product on the field. This
time the media attention is
for criticism from University
President Mark Schlissel of
the general athletic culture
and its role within the b
academic institution.
The continued patter of
athletics having a dominant
role in the media coverage of
the University can be traced DAVID
to one simple reason: people HARRIS
want football, basketball,
hockey and the other myriad
of sports, are willing to pay for said methods
of entertainment, and thus are given what
they want. It's the very basis of capitalism,
in which a demand is filled with a service for
the benefit of the producer and utility of the
consumer. This makes the American sports
industry a dominant force both economically
and socially, and often dominant over other
newsworthy events at the University.
This dominance of college athletics creates
a myriad of problems. It forces the NCAA
and the athletic departments of its member
schools to act both as a business and an
altruistic organization providing educational
opportunity and other opportunities to
student-athletes. The NCAA brings in more
than $870 million in revenue a year, and
Michigan itselfhas revenues totalingover $140

million, while at the same time championing
the free educational opportunities provided
for the very students they profit off of via
its monopoly. The sheer amount of money
thrown around in college athleticsexposes the
hypocrisy that the NCAA continues to try to
balance but refuses to acknowledge.
This is not just a problem of the alleged
bending of admissions for athletes or the time
commitments involved for student-athletes.
College sports have become tightly inter-
twined with not just the university experi-
ence but American culture itself. Because in
the end, the basic desires of fans are to watch
football, to watch their favorite school and to
watch their favorite school be good at football,
and thus a university is driven to throw large
sums of money around to meet these demands.
Colleges often spend more on coach salaries
than they do on compensated tuition for schol-
arship athletes. Many schools even charge
student fees that go directly toward the uni-
versity's athletic department (commendably,
Michigan does not charge these fees, contrib-
uting in part to our higher-than-average ticket
prices). And as a showing of the large demand
that brings in the money to make it all possible,
the 15 biggest stadiums in the United States are
all college football stadiums. For big-time pro-
grams, football and other sports have become
one of the greatest ways to market the school;
for smaller schools without the resources, it
becomes a seemingly necessary burden.
Athletics has also been tied to the very rea-
sons for applying and attending a school, and

down with stress
and anxiety.
Plenty of people say "laughter is
the best medicine," and we nod and
then continue on with our busy life-
styles. But laughter can actually be
helpful, and lucky for the Univer-
sity, we have ComCo. ComCo is the
premier improv comedy group on
campus that has been present since
1979, providing students with a
chance to step back from their aca-
demics to enjoy a hilarious show.
I talked with John Dennehy and
Daniel Markowitz, two members of
ComCo, to see what they had to say
about their group and their pres-
ence on campus.
Both seniors, Dennehy and
Markowitz joined ComCo as
freshmen. Dennehy, a business major,
sought out ComCo before coming to
campus. Markowitz, a Philosophy,
Politics and Economics major, found
ComCo via Maize Pages the day of
auditions. But in the end, both were
accepted and have since improved
their comedic skills. And after four
years, the influence on their lives
has been profound. Dennehy said,

"... it's a nice way to blow off steam
from stress of class and everything
... You have your friends which are,
often, a lot like you. But then when
you join groups, especially a small-
knit group like ComCo, where you're
in it for four years, you really get to
know people thatcyou probably would
never have met if you hadn't joined
the group." This is such a vital part of
a ComCo player's college experience,
that without it, the feeling "builds
up," as Markowitz said. "This
weirdness that just needs to get out.
And practice is such an open zone
and allows everythingto get out."
The improvised form of
entertainment allowsforthe audience
to getinvolved, not just sit and watch.
During a show, players ask the
audience for various nouns, locations
and adjectives. By participating, the
audience feels a greater connection
by contributing their own ideas,
and they step back from their own
lives to become part of the show.
Markowitz said he can tell that,
"They love getting into it with us."
With the buzzing crowd packed into
an Angell Hall auditorium, Dennehy
and the other ComCo players can feel
it as well. "It's symbiotic because we
feed off the audience's energy, they
feed off ours. We have a very tight
relationship with our audience." But
the benefits don't stop there. Not
only is a fantastic show produced, but
there are even health benefits.
According to a 2010 paper pub-
lished by Simon Lei and colleagues in
the Journal of Instructional Psychol-
ogy titled "Humor on Learning in the
College Classroom," there are several
health benefits to just simply laugh-

ing. The diaphragm massages the
right side of the heart, which releases
endorphins, and the cerebral cortex
is stimulated. Laughing also enhanc-
es self-image and self-confidence,
and alleviates anxiety and depres-
sion. With all of these benefits, it is
no wonder the phrase "laughter is the
best medicine" is so popular.
We need a chance to laugh. As stu-
dents, we push ourselves to our men-
tal, physical and emotional capacities
while ata competitive university. We
have to take a few seconds to forget
about the grades that we feel define
us and the workload ahead. From
a ComCo player's standpoint, you
can't take life too seriously. Dennehy
can see that there is more to this col-
lege experience than solely sitting
in a library. "Be present, listen to
what others are saying ... thinking
that school is school and everything
is what it is ... there's no fun in that.
At some point you have to enjoy your
life." It's a chance to salvage some of
your own mental health, to recover
from whatever stressors are present
in your life. These toxins accumu-
late, only hurting you further down
the road. But if you take one evening
every month to sit in an auditorium
and laugh until you cry, you will not
only leave that room with aching abs,
but also with a refreshed feeling. The
feeling that you took some time for
you, not for your professors or your
friends, not for your exam or that
CTools assignment, will be so restor-
ative to your life and your mental and
physical health.

The pendulum

i th an epidemic of
sexual assault sweep-

nation, including
the University of

are count-

uncertainty and
controversy. In a
four-part series,
James Brennan
seeks to explore JAMES
them with inter- BRENNAN
views and per-

This is part three.
Trigger warning: The following
article includes descriptions
of sexual assault and may be
triggering.
For students who have
attended the University in the
past few years, the issue of
sexual assault will forever be
synonymous with the name of a
former football player.
The University's handling
of rape allegations against
former kicker Brendan Gibbons
became a national news story
last year, and for good reason.
After The Michigan Daily broke
the story, online editor Austen
Hufford wrote a thorough piece
detailing the University's new
Student Sexual Misconduct
Policy, accompanied by a helpful
timeline of events. Here's a short
version of (my interpretation of)
what transpired:
In 2009, the University had
a terrible sexual assault poli-

be accused of assault without
investigation. Two years later,

notorious for In October, 28 Harvard Law

School professors signed on to
an op-ed in the Boston Globe
objecting to the school's sexual
assault policies, which carry
many similarities to The Uni-
versity's policies. The statement,
signed by liberal scholars like
Charles Ogletree and Alan Der-
showitz, argues that Harvard's
procedures "lack the most basic
elements of fairness and due pro-
cess" and "are overwhelmingly
stacked against the accused."
In interviews with dozens of
students, concerns about due
process were barely an after-
thought. Most students I asked
were unaware of Sterrett's law-
suit, and upon hearing my basic
rundown of the case, gave mixed
reactions. As we worked our way
through the issues around the
University's policy, moststudents
developed a reluctant desire to
see better respect for due pro-
cess. However, some remained
largely skeptical of accused rap-
ists being mistreated.
LSA senior and former SAPAC
volunteer coordinator Kathryn
Abercrombie asserted that the
University affords the accused
appropriate due process while
maintaining their support for
survivors. Abercrombie also
defended the school's burden
of proof, which only requires a
"preponderance of evidence" -
this is the lowestburden of proof
in American civil law.
Abercrombie argued that the
University's policies show how
it tries to stand by survivors,
which she feels is most
important (also acknowledging
that not all who've reported
feel this commitment from the
school). Moreover, Abercrombie
acknowledged the possibility of
Sterrett's case being mishandled
at an individual level, while also
pointing out that filing a lawsuit
does not mean he is innocent.
Anne Huhman, SAPAC's
program manager for
prevention and education,
defended the University's use
of preponderance of evidence,
saying the school's sexual assault
policy "follows the guidelines
established .,by the U.Se
Department of Education and its
Office of Civil Rights." According
to Huhman, the Student Sexual
Misconduct Policy "strives to
place the rights of both parties at
the core of the process."
Before I go on further, I'll
pause to acknowledge the
privileged position I come from;
as a male, and as a 6-foot-2,
220-pound male, the possibility
of being sexually assaulted
has virtually never entered my
head. I've never been sexually
assaulted, and my ability to
truly understand the trauma a
survivor feels or the fear women

have of being raped is minimal.
With that being said, I also
come from the privileged
position of having never been
accused of a crime I did not
commit. Nor was I ever found
guilty without strong evidence
and harshly punished in a way
that will follow me for the rest of
my life. Like any rational student,
I want my school to stand up for
students that have been sexually
assaulted and take swift action
against guilty parties. But, like
any rational student, I accept
that the term "guilty" cannot be
taken lightly.
The vast majority of sexual
assault accusations are genuine
and accurate - but some aren't.
The number of false accusations,
whether fabrications orfrommis-
taken identity, is not known. A
widely cited statistic claims only
2 percent of reported rape accu-
sations are false, but this number
is largely without scholarly basis.
Given the underreporting of rape
and other difficulties in creating
estimates, it's possible that false
accusations are that low - or
lower. No study has found a con-
clusive, accepted number.
Whatever this number is, we
know one thing: it isn't zero.
People have always been
falsely accused of crimes, and
sexual assault is no exception.
The University and other schools
have clearly failed in their duty
to protect students from rape
and sexual assault, but they
cannot answer by flippantly
branding students as rapists.
The University must continue to
aggressivelyinvestigate claims of
sexual violence while respecting
in full the due process rights of

and serves the valuable purpose
of relieving at least some trauma
for survivors. Similar, less
permanent measures should
accompany reforms to improve
due process. One suggestion is
immediate reviews for 60-day
restraining orders after all
sexual assault allegations. This
would put needed space between
survivors and the accused, while
also maintaining a commitment
to fairly evaluate the situation
before more drastic action.
It's likely that instituting
greater due process and stan-
dards of evidence will result in
guilty offenders getting away.
That is a reality we have to
accept, and one we accept with
our current policies. It's a real-
ity we have accepted in our jus-
tice system forever, and one we
will always have to accept. Sir
William Blackstone, the intellec-
tual godfather of American law,
wrote in 1765 that "better that
ten guilty persons escape than
that one innocent party suffer."
We demand this standard for the
accused in all crimes, and sexual
assault is no different.
I am incredibly torn on this
problem. While I'm deeply
committed to respecting the
rights of accused persons, I was
shocked by the sheer number
of women I met during the past
month who have been assaulted,
most of whom never saw justice
served. This is an outrage.

Weight" protests, I walked back

COURTESY OF DEPTFORD GOTH
"Look at this amazing article they wrote about me."
A Deptford Goth
recommendation



By CARLY SNIDER
For TheDaily
Taking music recommen-
dations from friends can be
a risky business - especially
when that friend has wronged
you in the past. Previous rec-
ommendations from said
companion include nonde-
script singer-songwriters and
aggressively bubbly British pop
music. So when she suggest-
ed that I check out Deptford
Goth's debut Life After Defo, I
was skeptical. Would I again
be stuck listening to an album
entirely opposite my musical
agenda, only to later face the
awkward question of how I
liked it? My friend's descrip-
tion of simply "chill electro
music" did not do much to
pique my interest. Eventually
my curiosity got the best of me
and I let the album play, only
haphazardly listening.
The first time through, I
quickly dismissed it as some-
thing to be played solely in the
background - an ambient lis-
tening perfect only for filling
empty space. I didn't find any-
thing wrong with it, but I also
didn't find anything special.
This sentiment was reinforced
by the slurred vocals, mumbled
to the point of melting into the
instrumentals. The overall lack
of pungent downbeats or crisp
notes gave me the impres-
sion of a simplicity that didn't
require a closer listen.

It was only on the second
and third listens, when I actu-
ally began to pay attention, that
I realized how very wrong I had
been. The flow of each song,
and of the album as a whole,
started to become clear to me
- and it was awesome. Dept-
ford's vocal delivery no longer
came off as half-hearted, but as
honest and soulful. The sparse
instrumentals suddenly made
sense with the lyrics. Oh, how
naive I'd been. The seemingly
simple album transformed into
something entirely new and
dynamic, and I could not stop
listening.
While the background
instrumentals initially seemed
to be comprised solely of syn-
thesizers and intermittent per-
cussion, a closer listen revealed
a much higher level of com-
plexity. Using harps, organs
and various forms of percus-
sion in combination with the
synth base, the overall tone of
the album is one of contempla-
tion and uncertainty. The rise
and fall of each song backs up
these feelings, especially when
the lyrical content of love and
death is taken into consider-
ation.
Goth's vocal style could be
likened to a sleepy Sam Smith
- a touch of R&B without try-
ing too hard. His intentional
mumbling is, at times, frustrat-
ing but also very impactful.
I found that it allowed him
to highlight the most impor-

tant lyrics of each song, even
if these lyrics were unclear in f
and of themselves. Lines such
as "Something's coming and
I can't see what it is..." are
common throughout, leaving
listeners such as myself to con-
template their meanings and -
implications. The album seems
to peak with "Objects Objects,"
a track strengthened by heavy
bass tones and standout lyr-
ics such as "As if you're telling
me there is no such thing as
heartache / As if you're tell-
ing me we'll come alive." Its
sound is both sad and hopeful
- themes that run through the
entire record, both lyrically
and musically.
There is something raw
and real about this album that
is relatable on the most basic
human level. Its ambient qual-
ity conveys emotion, even
without being able to decipher
the majority of the essentially
inaudible vocals. Aside from
these more serious aspects, the
record is also just a really cool
example of electro-pop.
As I now think so fondly of
this album, I regret my initial
skepticism. Some of the most
interesting art isn't necessarily
easy to dissect or understand
on the surface level. I have
learned my lesson and will try
to keep this in mind next time
a friend suggests new music,
even if the extent of their rec-
ommendation is as simple as
"chill electro music."

shapes.
"Reductive
Minimalism: Women Artist's
in Dialogue 1960-2014" is an
exhibit at UMMA, running
through Jan. 25. The concept
behind the exhibit, curated by
University alum Erica Barrish,
wastopair minimalist paintings
from the movements' origins in
the 1960s, with works from its
contemporary resurgence. The
exhibit contains nine pairs of
paintings, each focusing on
a specific element that both
old and new artists explores.
The pairings draw attention
to the common ground these
women artists share despite
generational and cultural
differences.
Barrish, the Director of
Sales for the Marianne Boesky
Gallery in New York and a
long time art specialist for
Christie's Auctions and Private
Sales, is the guest curator of
the exhibit. On Nov. 16, from
3-4:30 p.m., both she and
Alison Gass, associate director
for Exhibitions, Collection
and Curatorial Affairs at the
Cantor Arts Center at Stanford
University, will be speaking at
UMMA regarding this exhibit.
Barrish's study of fine
arts and art history at the
University prepared her well
for the different facets of the

art world.
"My early education as a
studio artist has allowed me to
work today in the commercial
marketplace identifying
with working artists as well
as working with historical
material," Barrish said. "While
art history at Michigan has
allowed me to speak the
vernacular that has helped
me academically, but also
commercially."
As the curator, Barrish built
the conceptual structure from
which the exhibit evolved.
Once she knew the themes of
the exhibit, it was a matter of
finding and accessing works
that would form the exhibit.
This process is often why
exhibitions take so long to
come to fruition. From start
to finish, Barrish estimated it
took her two and a half years to
compile all the elements of this
exhibit.
"Part of being a curator is
knowing where the bones are
buried, and not in the obvious
places. That takes a career of
being in the marketplace. You
see things that people don't
know exist," Barrish said.
The treasure hunt proved
to be especially challenging
for this exhibit because she
needed to gather works from
two separate periods of art. In
addition, each piece needed
a comparable work from a
different period, meaning
that matching complementary
pieces was crucial. The
original female minimalists
did not receive the commercial
success that modern female
minimalists have received,
making Barrish's knowledge
of the art market's evolution
even more valuable. Barrish
elaborated on the process of
finding themes to explore in
exhibitions.
"It starts by wondering why
there were certain voids in
a collection, then looking at
other institutions' collections
and looking at what their voids
were ... they were remiss atsome
of the historical material."

Though the search and
acquisition process was
extensive, knowing when to cut
was equally important in the .
building process. Originally
Barrish had over a hundred
pieces in mind, and eventually
whittled it down to 18 works,
making nine pairs. This
selectivity allows for both a
greater focus on each piece and
amore streamlined experience
for the viewer.
Barrish purposefully sought
out work made by a broad
spectrum of artists. For one
artist, Svenja Deiningeran, it
was her first show in the United
States. Barrish's experience
as the Director of Sales for
the Marianne Boesky gallery
exposed her to young talent
throughout the world.
"Coming from a commercial
vantage point with a historical
background has allowed me to
understand the seismic shift
she has presented as a painter
and also (to understand) that
she is somebody worth paying
attention to," Barrish said.
Barrish stressed that the
pairs in which the artists were
not only living during different
times, but in different places,
were often the most successful.
For example, artist Shirazeh
Houshiary, an Iranian artist, is
the only Middle Eastern artist
in the show, and her work is
juxtaposed with Sally Hazelet
Drummond, an American artist
who rose to prominence in the
1950s.
"When you look at her
(Houshiary's) work in
comparison to Sally Hazelet
Drummond, whois as American
as you could possibly get, there
is no question that those woman
are speaking exactly the same
language about syncopated
brushstrokes and tactility of
surfaces," Barrish said. "Not
only are they separated by
several generations, they are
separated by continents, and
their work couldn't be more
synergy. For me that's one of
the strongest comparisons in
the entire exhibition."

The move has been both
heralded as a progressive
response to the serious plight
of the working mother, and
concurrently criticized as
a selfish attempt to control

is a generous way of granting
women agency over both their
careers and their family lives,
it seems to me like a sad sub-
mission: Apple and Facebook

basically telling working
women "No, you can't have it

that if women want to be suc-

they should wait to have kids,

didn't want to get into a dis-
cussion of the Mommy Wars,
the slightly derogatory term
for the difficult choice moth-
ers make to stay at home or
work. Clearly, everything
would be better if we lived in
a world where moms and dads
and stepparents and those
without children all had the
agency and means to do what-
ever they wanted with their
lives. Unfortunately, we don't.
The dichotomy between work-
ing mothers and non-working
ones is no better represented
than on TV. We have Olivia
Pope and Kalinda Sharma,
fierce and sexy and hard-
edged, firmly childless. Or we
have Claire Dunphy, a stay-at-
home mom who is frustrated
and unfulfilled. There isn't
much in between. However,
those few, there are televi-
sion (and real-life) women
who have been able to juggle
careers and children without
following Apple and Face-
book's edict that they should
to delay having children in
order to be successful.
When my friends and I dis-
cuss which "Sex and the City"
characters we are, I consis-
tently yell, "I'm a Miranda!"
Miranda Hobbes, the cyni-
cal, neon-haired, ambitious
lawyer who spends much
of her time on-screen judg-
ing the off-kilter choices of
her more glamorous friends;
Miranda, who gladly works 80
hour weeks and (hilariously)
fights back against sexism in
her office; Miranda, who gets
pregnant in her late 30s and
decides to keep both her baby
and her high-powered job, a
choice rarely represented on
television. In one particularly
poignant scene, she tapes her
face to the mobile hanging
above her son's bed, terrified
that he won't remember her.
Miranda can balance single
motherhood and a career,
but the show isn't afraid to
show how hard it is to do so
- she isn't anything close to
a superhero, and when she
loses control she is at her most
relatable.
On NBC's "Parenthood,"
Julia Braverman-Graham is
the youngest of the four cen-
tral siblings, and from the
beginning she is depicted as
another ambitious, go-getter
litigator. For the first few sea-
sons of the show, it seems as
though Julia truly does have
it all: she works insane hours,
but finds time to make it to
her family's bi-weekly get-
togethers (why the extended
Bravermans spend so much
time together is beyond me.)
Her husband Joel takes care
of their daughter, navigating
the perils of the PTA so she
doesn't have to.
It's almost too picture
perfect, which is why it was
so powerful when Julia's
carefully constructed faade
began to unravel in season
four, beginning when Joel
decides to go back to work.
She makes a fatal mistake at
the firm because she's wor-
ried about her newly adopted

son, and then misses her
daughter's recital to cover
up for that mistake, and sud-
denly, poignantly, we find
Julia standing in her kitchen,
breakfast burning behind
her, as she repeats, "I can't
do it anymore." It takes a
show fully aware of its char-
acters to portray this kind of
breakdown realistically - but
"Parenthood" doesn't stop
here. Julia doesn't become a
content, non-working mom.
After a few months with a
listless lack of structure, she
falls apart, achingly demon-
strating that some moms are
better when they are working,
happier and healthier when
they have lives outside of their
children. Julia's desperation
and the ravaging effects it
has on her family is painful

to watch, but also a deeply
complex representation of a
woman who is earnestly try-
ing to figure out how to make
things work best for her and
her family.
Both Julia and Miranda
are fleshed-out examples of
corporate working mothers -
high-powered, Ivy-educated
execs who also happen to
change diapers and go to
tee-ball games. But not all
powerful portrayals of work-
ing mothers take place in the
corporate world. In a manner
that mirrors actress Connie
Britton's own mid-life revival,
her character Tami Taylor
on "Friday Night Lights" is
a flawlessly flawed example
of a woman who took the
traditional route and stayed
home with her daughter
before deciding to embark on
a career. Tami works as a high
school counselor, bringing
the same prescription of mea-
sured pragmatism and nurtur-
ing warmth to her career that
she does to her family. She
doesn't fumble while adjust-
ing to this new role, but rather
is able to tailor her charisma
into her job, growing as an
advocate for her students and
her family.
Tami is not a leader in the
same way as Miranda and
Julia, and her job grants her
some basic flexibility that
the corporate life doesn't.
However, she is unapologeti-
cally ambitious in her career,
just as they are, moving from
counselor to principal and
ultimately college administra-
tor. Tami also doesn't have
the freedom within her rela
tionship that the others do;
unlike Miranda, who raises
Brady mainly on her own,
and Julia, who relies on Joel
to stay home with the kids,
Tami also must compete with
her husband, Eric, constantly
reasserting that her job is
just as important as his. She
is effectively waging a war on
three fronts; her career, her
children and her husband.
This constant struggle makes
it so much more empowering
that the show ends with their
family moving for her career
rather than Eric's.
Why do these women mat-
ter so much? While TV isn't
perfect, the past few years
have shown a meteoric rise in
powerful female role models,
these characters included.
Why must the Julias and
Tamis and Mirandas be dis-
tinguished from the Olivias
and the Claires - admirable
and successful in their own
right?
Because Apple and Face-
book's announcement shows
that while they care about the
women who work for them -
and I do believe their move is in
many ways progressive - they
are giving up on Miranda and
Julia and Tami, giving up on
the idea of a world in which it's
OK for women to choose to have
kids and a career within their
own chosen time frame.
Because my mom has
worked a high-powered job

my whole life and also raised
three children. Because she
has missed some of my broth-
ers' soccer games and fed us
chiefly Stouffer's frozen lasa-
gna. Because this morning she
called me from the airport three
times to give me advice on this
column. Because I call myself
a Miranda due to the fact that
she has always said she was one
too. No one can have it all - and
the idea that we must strive for
that sets an impossible stan-
dard - but as I begin to think
about what I want to do for the
rest of my life, I need to know I
can do it all, whatever my "all"
is. Miranda, Julia, Tami and
my mom taught me that I can.
That's why they matter.

If "The Walking Dead" contin-

With one guaranteed spot open

find themselves in the same posi-

includes previous nominees that

Good Wife," "Homeland" and
"Boardwalk Empire." There are
also shows that have never been
nominated and series yet to air;
the most anticipated being AMC's
"Better Call Saul."
"The Walking Dead" still has
some of the most potential out of
any TV series. Now that it is living
up to some of it, it might have
chance of earning recognition
and establishing itself as an elite

By CHLOE GILKE
Daily TV/New Media Editor
When it aired its tragically
brief, brilliant flame of a first sea-
son in 2005, "The Comeback"
was a parody
of a genre that
barely existed.
Before the The
advent of the Comeback
Kardashians
and the Real Season 2
Housewives, a Premiere
show follow- Sundaysiat
ing an abrasive 10p.m.
fading star HBO
and her messy
personal life
could only have so much cultural
weight. "The Comeback" wasn't
just "before its time," but down-
right uncanny in the way it pre-
dicted the future landscape of
reality and comedy television. A
2014 "limited series," packaged in
the prestigious, elusive HBO lingo,
gives "The Comeback" the perfect
opportunity to prove its relevance
to the post-network era.
Valerie Cherish (Lisa Kudrow,
"Friends") returns as vivacious
and delightfully delusional as ever,
searching for a way to revive her
languishing career. In the nine
years since "Room and Bored"
(the awful laugh-track sitcom Val
deemed her first "comeback" to
television), she's starred ina series
of student films, appeared on "The
Real Housewives of Beverly Hills"
and launched a wildly unsuccess-
ful haircare line. Valerie would do
anything to regain her position as
the "it girl" of TV, and she chases
every meager lead she sees to be
back in front of the camera. A cam-
era crew of students (not evenfilm
students) is following Val around
to record a demo tape for Bravo's
Andy Cohen, her endeavor based
only on the fact that she had a
cordial interaction with Cohen on
Twitter.
The show's sense of humor is

entirely based on how pathetic
Valerie appears. Watching the
renowned and talented Lisa
Kudrow jump around a crowd
of paparazzi, screaming desper-
ately to catch her more-famous
friend's attention, induces only
the cringiest of laughs. You laugh
at Valerie because she's ridiculous.
Everything from her terrible Mat-
thew McConaughey impression
(an "alright, alright, alright" per-
formed in her own shrill intona-
tion)to her suburban momhaircut
turn Valerie into a walking punch-
line. She's old, she's silly and it's
funny because nomatter howhard
she screams from the sidelines,
nobody cares enough to notice her.
But Kudrow's performance is any-
thing but schticky and overdrawn.
Valerie is the amalgamation offall-
en sitcom queen types like Valerie
Bertinelli and Kirstie Alley (who
also had their own "comeback"
reality shows), a tragic reminder
that a woman's opportunity for the
spotlight is unfortunately brief.
"The Comeback"'s cringe com-
edy sometimes borders on overly
acerbic and mean-spirited as the
show puts Valerie through the,
ringer. The nausea-inducing, jerky
camera and lingering looks of the
people reacting put us right into
the scene with Valerie, but never
with the comfort of experienc-
ing exactly what our heroine sees.
We're forced to watch every eye-
roll and dismissive smile, often
in close-up shots. Seeing Valerie
make a fool of herself has dimin-
ishing returns, and in the first half
ofthe episode,whenVallooks back
on the past nine years ofher career
and films her Andy Cohen deyno,
the tone is too cruel. "The Come-
back" is at its best when it depicts
Valerie as going against the grain,
cheerful and determined despite
all the obstaclesshe trips over. See-
ing her with no agency, dancing
around in front of the camera with
no hope of her "comeback," slows
the episode down. Only when Val

sees aspark of an outlet for her tal-
ent does the show regain its proper
tone.
Valerie's new opportunity, iron-
ically, comes in the form of playing
herself. Her former boss Paulie G.
(played to douchey perfection by
Lance Barber, "It's Always Sunny
in Philadelphia") is making a
prestige dramedy for HBO called
"Seeing Red," based loosely off his
experience working on "Room and
Bored" and his tumultuous rela-
tionship with the show's redhead-
ed star. Naturally, Val is pretty
pissed that Paulie is using her star
to forge the ultimate accomplish-
ment for a writer in 2014: he gets
to write and direct every episode,
and receive automatic auteur cred
whether it's warranted or not. This
is all without Valerie's permission.
She storms HBO demanding that
somebodyletherseePaulie G., and
stumbles into a casting meeting.
The executives hesitantly give her
a script, make her read a "dramat-
ic" scene in which Valerie's char-
acter expresses her frustration at
being "old, annoying and unfuck-
able." The producers evidently had
been planning this all along, but
didn't have the oirtesy to includf
Valerie in on the joke.
More ambitious than any-
thing its first season attempted,
Valerie is actually giving up her
identity this season, diminish-
ing herself to a character written
by her worst enemy - anything
to be back in the spotlight. The
first half of the episode is admit-
tedly bland, but once Val starts
calling her own shots and making
her own decisions (in short, once
she chooses to embarrass herself
rather than allow embarrassing
things to happen to her), "The
Comeback" reaches the same
hilarious heights it did nine years
ago. And though Valerie seems
poised to degrade herself even
further in pursuit of fame, she's
certainly come back from worse.
She will survive.

James talks jazz

The Brooks return

By CAROLYN DARR
For The Daily
University alum and world-
renowned jazz keyboardist,
arranger and producer Bob James
is coming home
to play Hill
Auditorium this An Evening
Saturday.As part with Bob
of the University
Musical James, UMS
Society's Jazz Jazz Series
Series, "An
Evening with Nov.15, 8p.m.
Bob James" will Hill Auditorium
feature James $10 to $54
backed by a
quintet of hand-
picked musicians that are sure to
awe and inspire.
Growing up in the small town
of Marshall, Missouri, James
did not have much exposure to
jazz except for a few recordings
his parents owned, but this was
enough to inspire him to make
the art form a lifestyle. His father,
who had attended law school in
Missouri, wanted James to follow
in his footsteps, but James wanted
to pursue his music professionally,
and so chose the University's
distinguished school of music.
"The Michigan Music School
had a strong reputation so I chose
it back at the time for that reason
not realizing until I actually got
enrolled that there was no jazz
department," he said. "I was
pretty frustrated about that and

it took me awhile to realize it was
going to be more important to get
a well-rounded education taking
advantage of the broad aspect of
the University of Michigan and
the classical educationI would get
there."
From1957to1961Jamesstudied
for his undergraduate degree in
composition and ended up staying
and receiving his masters in 1962.
Following the completion of his
training, James moved to New
York City and began his career
as an outstanding jazz artist.
Discovered at the Notre Dame
Jazz Festival in 1963, James
went on to record 58 albums
and win a multitude of awards,
including two Grammys and
most recently the George Benton
Lifetime Achievement Award in
2006. James' smooth jazz has
also influenced other genres,
including hip-hop. Two of James'
most famous songs, "Nautilus"
and "Take Me to the Mardi Gras,"
have been sampledby well-known
artists such as Public Enemy, Run-
DMC, Ghostface Killah and many
more.
Last Saturday, James was
honored as one of the 2014
inductees into the University of
Michigan School of Music Hall of
Fame. Presented annually since
1977, this award was created to
recognize and honor alumni
who have made significant
contributions to the school, their
profession and society at large.

"It is especially significant
to me (to be inducted) because
when I was at school there was no
jazz department so-there was no
opportunity to take classes in jazz
education," he said. "Now there
is, and that change alone I'm very
happy about and I am happy to be
someone represented there in the
Hall of Fame who has spent my
whole life in music specializing in
jazz."
The forthcoming concert at
Hill Auditorium is, of course, a
bit of a homecoming for James,
who has played there multiple
times in the past. As a student, he
played at Hill multiple times and
later was featured as a solo artist.
On Saturday, he will be joined by
guitarist Perry Hughes, bassist
Carlitos de Puerto, drummer
Harvey Mason and saxophonist
Andy Snitzer - all of whom are
celebrated intheir own right.
"I'm extremely excited to be
going back (to Hill Auditorium)
and reliving old memories,"
James said. "It's a great venue, a
great facility. I heard a lot of other
artists - pop and classical and jazz
artists - perform there back when
I was in college, so it's recognized
as one of the great performing
venues in the world. It's a very big
deal for me to be going back there.
Michigan has been a big deal for
me my whole adult life, so it's very
sentimental. It's certainly not just
another concert gig for me, it's
very, very special."

The Michigan football team needs one win to be bowl eligible. As for what happens after that would be anyone's guess.

they might be a good get for a
middling bowl.
Regardless of the record, bowl
officials know the Wolverines
could draw more fans than, say,
Iowa.
In terms of fan support,
New York is certainly a
popular holiday destination.
But watching a football game
in frigid weather with the
sightlines of Yankee Stadium
isn't allthat attractive.'
The Heart of Dallas Bowl:
Big Ten vs. Conference USA;
Dec.26:
Fun fact: In 1981, Michigan
played its first postseason game
ih the state of Texas. It beat
UCLA, 33-14, in the Bluebonnet
Bowl.
If the Wolverines accept a
bid to the Heart of Dallas Bowl,
it could face an intriguing
matchup against Marshall, one
of the nation's three remaining

undefeated programs.
But other than that, there's
nothing intrinsically exciting
about facing a Conference USA
team.
The Quick Lane Bowl: ACC
vs. Big Ten; Dec.26:'
The Wolverines have never
played a bowl game in Detroit.
And while it would almost
certainly feel like a home game
at Ford Field, many in-state
fans would be reluctant to
spend money and time watching
Michigan again - after all,
tickets have been readily
available for games at the Big
House all year.
The Quick Lane Bowl's
website already has a picture
of Devin Gardner on the home
page. The image is probably a
placeholder, but if it transpires,
at least it's a short drive.
Staying home:

With a win last Saturday, the
Wolverines clinched back-to-
back victories for the first time
all year. They'll likely need one
against Maryland to qualify for
the postseason, and that's no
small task.
The Terrapins have just three
losses: blowouts to Ohio State
and Wisconsin, and a narrow
defeat to West Virginia. They
also boast wins over Iowa and
an impressive road triumph over
Penn State.
If Michigan loses, fans will
be treated to an iteration of The
Game where the Wolverines
are fighting for any sort of
postseason berth, while the
Buckeyes continue to compete
for a spot in the very first College
Football Playoff.

The Beilein Paradox

game from a Pizza Hut in
Grand Rapids,
Michigan,
and the only
other people
in the restau-
rant were an
impassioned,
older Michi-
gan fan and a
woman who MAX
sat quietly BULTMAN
with him.
Throughout
the second half, that fan yelled at
Trey Burke, berated John Beilein
and my God did he scream at
Luke Hancock.
I didn't get it. I couldn't trace
his anger. Michigan wasn't even
supposed to be in the national
championship, but the game was
close right to the very end. Now,
after another year and another
deep tournament run, I think
I've finally figured out what that
guy was thinking.
He set the bar for the Wol-
verines at their ceiling and then
-'n""expectedthem to cear it If

that sounds like a contradiction,
that's because it is.
That's the standard John
Beilein has built for the Michi-
gan men's basketball team. Not a
screaming, disappointed fan in a
Pizza Hut, but ateam that beats
the odds with such regularity
that fans have come to expect it.
Beilein's teams have been a
refuge for Michigan fans lately,
not simply because they've won,
but because they've done it with
dramatic flair, even when they
weren't supposed to. Fans know
what his most recent teams have
done, and now they want it by the
pound.
Expecting Michigan to repeat
the kind of success Beilein's
teams have had in the last few
years just isn't fair. Not when it
will rely heavily on unproven
freshmen in the frontcourt and
play in arguably the best confer-
ence in the nation.
And yet, as we temper expec-
tations for the Wolverines, we do
so with one caveat: They could
defy logic again. -
We predict one result, and
then we anticinnae hem outner-

forming that forecast. What kind
of logic is that?
Call it Beilein's Paradox,
because Michigan's veteran
coach is directly responsible for
this puzzling phenomenon.
It's easy to forget that the Wol-
verines lost to lowly Charlotte in
the championship of last season's
Puerto Rico Tip-Off. They were a
young team that didn't know who
to look to for a big shot - exactly
what they were expected to be.
And yet, by late January, Mich-
igan was right where it wanted
to be - undefeated in league play
and first in the Big Ten.
Beilein coaches with a big-
ger vision in mind. He doesn't
so much mind a stumble here or
there if he ends up in the right
spot at the end. The approach
is conducive to stability, and in
growth.PAUL SHERMAN/Daily
John Beilein has a flair for taking teams with low expectations and exceeding them.
Keeping with that approach,
the Wolverines never lost back- win 10 straight, including three Beilein's teams have also had a

other Jordan Morgan charge.
Those moments are special for
a reason - they're a factor you
can't count on. But Beilein makes
it easy to expect them anyway.
Here's what reality says: True
freshmen are going to look like
true freshmen at times, and
Michigan could rely on five of
them this year. It's too early to tell
whether Zak Irvin and Derrick
Wd Walton Jr. are ready to shoulder
larger loads. The Big Ten is going
to be as tough as ever.
Knowing all of that, the media
didn't pick Michigan to finish
in the top three of the Big Ten.
Some say they're not sure if the
msWolverines will be in the top five.
There might not be any enchant-
ment coming the Wolverines'
way this time.
' But it's getting to the point
where nothing a Beilein-coached
team does will surprise anyone.
They could win the whole thing,
and few would be stunned if they
do. And ina funny way, that's its
own brand of high expectations.

it inspired a belief and gave the
group some hope."
But things only got worse when
Michigan lost to Minnesota by
five.
"When you look at the
Minnesota game, it was just a
perfect storm," Alexander said,
"a culmination of us trying to find
our identity at a time when we
were still establishing that on the
court."
For Beilein, the pressure was
mounting. After being ranked in
the preseason a year earlier and
then ultimately missing out on
the NCAA Tournament and NIT,
some began to call for his job
after the 1-6 conference start.
"I think he probably was (on
the hot seat)," Morgan said.
"One year, you're going to the
tournament. The next year, you're
ranked in the preseason and we
didn't even make the NIT. To
come in and have another terrible
season ... I think that put a lot of
pressure on him. It put pressure
on the players. We just wanted to
do well."
Added Beilein: "It was a real
low point in that season. And in
my coaching tenure, it was a low
point."
Beilein wanted to believe the
type of play the team showed in
the non-conference season and in
earlier losses would come back.
Michigan had played too many
close games to not show anything

for its effort. But at the same time,
Beilein had his doubts.
"I know in this business, when
you're paid my salary, when you
have this type of commitment to
the basketball program, you're
not going to survive - you have
to win enough games," he said.
"One and six in the Big Ten.
So, do we go 1-17? That's going

meeting almost," Novak said.
"We kind of looked at each other
and said, 'Alright, it's time to turn
this around.'"
At some point, the team had
to click. But with Michigan State
next on the docket, would it
happen in East Lansing?
"We had nobody with really any
experience playing (at Michigan
State) or being successful there,"
Morgan said. "Going there, we

SB Friday, November 14 2014 // Tip Off

The inflection point of
Michigan basketball

story by Daniel Feldman, Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan men's basketball
team is in a slump as it enters the
beast that is the Breslin Center
the night of Jan. 27, 2011. Losers
of six straight games and carrying
a 1-6 conference record, the
Wolverines are in East Lansing
having not won there since 1997.
Up 57-55 with 33.3 seconds left
against Michigan State, Darius
Morris catches an inbounds pass
from the sideline.
Before the game, John Beilein

told Morris to shoot it if the
Spartans went through a ball
screen. This was news for a player
who led the team in assists and
would go on to set a single-season
program record in the statistic.
As Morris dribbles over half
court, Keith Appling guards him
before switching off as Morris
gets to the free-throw line. With
the shot clock down to four,
Morris plants his lead foot on
the Spartan logo in the paint

and dishes the rock toward Stu
Douglass, who stands behind the
3-point line on the right side of
the court.
"It's only fair to say that game
was an inflection point of where
the program's heading," said Zach
Novak. "If we win this game, the
season is turned around. ... If we
could win that game, we could
win any game."

After a disappointing 2009-10
season, not much was expected
of Michigan in 2010-11. The team
had lost its four tallest players
and two leading scorers - Manny
Harris and DeShawn Sims - and
was picked to finish last in the Big.
Ten.
With no seniors on the squad,
the team lacked any true veterans
besides Douglass and Novak.
The preparation for the season
started earlier than usual for the

Wolverines. Allowed an overseas
trip every four years, the team
traveled to Belgium to play four
games against professional
teams. Beilein found it to be
advantageous for such a young
team to begin practicing in
August.
The team went 1-3 on the
Europe tour.
"Everyone was like, 'Oh,
they're going to suck,' even
though we were playing top-
