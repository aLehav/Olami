Proposal is 'critical
to ensuring equal
rights,' letter says
By CLAIRE GOSCICKI
Daily StaffReporter
The University's chapter of the
American Civil Liberties Union
sent a letter to University Housing
administrators this week urging
them to enact the Open Housing
Initiative, a proposal designed by
members of the Michigan Student
Assembly and other student groups
that would offer students living in
University residences the option of
choosing a roommate of anygender.
The letter states that implemen-
tation of the initiative is "critical to
ensuringequalrightsforallstudents
living in residence halls," and that
"adapting housing policy to include
an open housing option is consistent
with the University's commitment
to non-discrimination."
The Washtenaw County and state
of Michigan ACLU branches also
expressed support for gender-neu-
tral University housing by signing
the letter.

The Open Housing Initiative sub-
mitted a report months in the mak-
ing to University Housing officials
last month, urging the body to offer
a gender-neutral housing option
starting in the fall. The day after
the students submitted the propos-
al, Director of University Housing
Linda Newman said it was unlikely
that the proposal would be imple-
mented come fall.
"Typically we always do the room
sign-upforreturningstudentsinlate
January," Newman told the Daily
at the time. "Before people sign up,
we have a marketing period where
we let people know what to expect,
what we're offering."
LSA senior Mallory Jones, chair
of the University's chapter of the
ACLU and a former news editor
for the Daily, called the initiative a
"good, progressive policy," adding
that it's important because it would
ensure that all students have equal
access to University Housing.
"As the ACLU, we feel that the
implementation of an open housing
policy is critical to ensuring equal
rights for all students living in resi-
dence halls, including transgender
students,"the letter states."The cur-

Originally, policy
allowed for general

Though this Saturday's Big
Chill at the Big House is sold

out, some students aren't pleased
about a change in the student'
ticket policy for the outdoor
hockey game at Michigan Stadi-
um between the Wolverines and
Michigan State University.
When officials first announced
the Big Chill last January, the
Athletic Department initially
planned on having the student
section - located in sections
25-32 in the northwest corner
of the stadium - be a general

admissions area. However, after
exyeriencingproblems with gen-
eral admission seating at the Big
House for Spring Commencement
in May, the Athletic Department
changed its policy, according to
Athletic Department spokesman
David Ablauf.
"At graduation, it became very
obvious that people would not
fill the sections to capacity and
there was concern from a security
standpoint about getting all stu-

dents adequately seated," Ablauf
wrote in an e-mail.
Tickets to the game were
included in both football and
hockey student season ticket
packages for $5. Students were
also able to purchase additional
tickets for $10 each.
In March, when the initial
e-mail about purchasing tickets
was sent to students, the Athletic
Department intended to allow

NOT YOUR AVERAGE RELATIONSHIP STATUS

After measure clears
House, bill still faces
uphill battle in Senate.
By SUZANNE JACOBS
Daily StaffReporter
In a victorious late-term push
* by the lame duck Democratic
majority, the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives passed a bill Wednes-
day that would grant temporary
legal status to hundreds of thou-
sands of undocumented students,
and give them the opportunity to

gain permanent resident status.
First introduced to the U.S.
Senate in 2001, the Development,
Relief and Education for Alien
Minors Act - commonly known
as the DREAM Act - would allow
six-year permanent resident sta-
tus to individuals who came to
the U.S. before turning 16, have
graduated from high school or
obtained a GED certificate, are
under the age of 35, demonstrate
"good moral character" and have
lived in the U.S. for at least five
consecutive years at the time of
the bill's enactment.
After completing at least two

years of higher education or mili-
tary service, these individuals
would be able to apply for five
more years of non-immigrant
status, and after ten years, they
would be eligible to apply for per-
manent residency.
Though supporters both in
Congress and at the University say
they are optimistic about Wednes-
day's vote, they said the fight to
turn the bill into law is far from
over.
Sociology Prof. Silvia Pedraza
said she watched the vote on the
bill on C-Span and was happy

By ROBIN VEECK
Daily StaffReporter
Though University alum Joilyn
Stephensonsignedup forthe Michi-
gan College Advising Corps to help
give Michigan high school students
the tools to attend colleges like the

University, after a few months work-
ing at Pontiac High School, she says
the students have had an impact on
her as well.
"Some of these students come
from a difficult background, but
they still have it in their heart to
make the most out of their future,"
Stephenson wrote in an e-mail
interview. "That in itself is amaz-
ing."
Stephenson is one of eight recent
University graduates currently
working in Michigan public schools
to help students from underserved
districts apply to and attend college.

Each adviser in the program, which
the University launched in April,
works full-time in a school with tra-
ditionally low college matriculation
rates.
Christopher Rutherford, College
Advising Corps program manager
at the Center for Educational Out-
reach, said the program has four
primary goals.
"Those goals are first centered
around increasing the number of
students that go on to four-year
institutions," Rutherford said. "The
second goal is to increase the types

Low barriers to

By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily StaffReporter
According to frequent cab rid-
ers, a cab company official and
the self-proclaimed "King o' the
Cabbies," Ann Arbor is a prime
place for the taxi business.
Area cab aficionados say the

combination of a large popula-
tion of students - both sober and
drunk - and a relatively accessi-
ble licensing process has created
somewhat of an oasis for taxicabs
in an area of the country well
known for its reliance on private
vehicles.
According to Ann Arbor Police
Officer Bill Clock, who works in
AAPD's Special Services Unit and
is responsible for the licensing of
taxis and their drivers, there are
currently 166 licensed taxicabs
in the city, as well as 310 licensed
drivers.
In addition to the high volume

of taxicabs, Clock said he's seen a
recent increase in limousines for
hire, which operate on a flat rate
instead of a meter.
James Fowler, assistant to
the owner of Blue Cab, said Ann
Arbor's taxicab scene is especially
vibrant for a place like southeast
Michigan.
"There's a population of about
120,000, plus another 80,000
kids," Fowler said. "It's a good
market; (but) it's a great market
for this area."
Blue Cab has approximately
50 drivers for its fleet of about 40

Senate votes to repeal
of 'Don't ask, don't tell'

17-year-old military
policy remains in
place after 57-40 vote
WASHINGTON (AP) - Senate
Republicansblocked a major year-
end push by Democrats to lift
the military's ban on openly gay
troops yesterday, dealing a huge
blow to gay rights groups' hopes
for repeal of "don't ask, don't tell"
any time soon. President Barack
Obama instantly appealed to
lawmakers to make another, last-
ditch try before going home for
the year.
The day's dramatic events left
the fate of the issue in limbo, with
lawmakers eager to adjourn and
still facing numerous other con-
tentious issues.
The Senate's 57-40 vote fell
three short of the 60 needed to
overcome procedural hurdles to
lift the 17-year-old ban. Sen. Susan
Collins of Maine was the lone
Republican voting to advance the
bill, and Sen. Joe Manchin ofWest
Virginia was the only Democrat to
vote against it.
The rejection was a defeat for
Obama, who campaigned promis-
ing to overturn the law and later
called it one of his top legisla-
tive priorities for the year. But in
recent weeks the White House
has done little to push the legisla-

tion, focusingits influence instead
on tax cuts and a nuclear arms
treaty with Russia.
Obama wasn't giving up. He
said the ban "weakensournational
security, diminishes our military
readiness and violates fundamen-
tal American principles of fair-
ness, integrity and equality." And
he said repeal is supported by the
military and the American people.
"I urge the Senate to revisit
these important issues during the
lame duck session," he said.
Senate Majority Leader Harry
Reid was biting in his comments
about Republican foes. "The other
side may feel passionately that our
military should sanction discrim-
ination based on sexual orienta-
tion, but they are clearly in the
minority," he said. "And they have
run out of excuses."
But Republicans faulted him
for the way the issue was brought
to a vote, saying the procedure
sealed the outcome.
The 1993 law bans gay troops
from publicly acknowledging
their sexual orientation. A repeal
provision was included in a broad-
er defense policy bill and passed
last spring in the House.
More than 60 senators were
expected to support repeal of
the ban, including at least four
Republicans. But GOP senators
were united in demanding that
the chamber vote on tax cuts first.

They also wanted assurances by
Reid they would be given exten-
sive time to debate the defense
bill, which contained other divi-
sive provisions including one that
would allow abortions at overseas
military facilities.
Two senators, Republican
Collins and independent Joe
Lieberman of Connecticut, said
they now would introduce a
stand-alone measure to repeal
"don't ask, don't tell." Its pros-
pects are uncertain, though Reid
indicated he was open to bring-
ing it up before adjournment.
If passed, it still would require
House approval with time grow-
ing short.
Gay rights advocates were furi-
ous about yesterday's events.
"Instead of doing what is right,
the world's greatest delibera-
tive body devolved into shameful
schoolyard spats that put petty
partisan politics above the
needs of our women and men in
uniform," said Joe Solmonese,
president of the Human Rights
Campaign.
Democrats had said yesterday
morning they remained hopeful
a last-minute deal could be struck
with Collins, believing her sup-
port would persuade other GOP
senators - namely Massachusetts
Sen. Scott Brown and Alaska Sen.
Lisa Murkowski - to advance the
legislation.

Report says school
failed to issue
'timely' warning of
shooter
RICHMOND, Va. (AP) - Virgin-
ia Tech could be fined as much as
$55,000 because it broke the law by
waiting too long to notify students
during a 2007 shooting rampage,
according to a federal report issued
yesterday.
The U.S Department of Educa-
tion had found in January that the
school violated federal law with its
response during the deadliest mass
shooting in modern U.S. history, but
gave Tech a chance to respond to the
finding in its preliminary report. In
yesterday's final report, federal offi-
cials rejected Tech's arguments that
it met standards in place at the time.
"While Virginia Tech failed to
adequately warn students that day,
we recognizethattheuniversity has
put far-reaching changes in place
since that time to help improve
campus safety and better protect
its students and community," U.S.
Department of Education Secretary
Arne Duncan said.
School officials won't face crimi-
nal charges for breaking the law, the
department said.
The university disputed the find-
ings, and spokesman Larry Hincker

said the school likely will appeal if it
is sanctioned.
The school could be fined up to
$55,000 and could face the loss of
federal student financial aid.
However, an expert on the law
that requires notification of danger
- known as the Clery Act - said
loss of federal aid is unlikely.
S. Daniel Carter, director of pub-
lic policy for Security On Campus,
said CleryActreviews are relatively
rare: The Tech review was the 35th
in 20 years. No school has ever lost
federal funding, and the largest
fine was $350,000 against Eastern
Michigan University for failing to
report the killing of a student in a
dormitory in 2006.
The department found that the
university violated the Clery Act
because it failed to issue a timely
warning after a gunman killed two
students in a dormitory early on
April 16, 2007. The school sent out
an e-mail about the shootings about
two hours later, but by that time
student gunman Seung-Hui Cho
was chaining shut the doors to a
classroom building where he killed
30 more students and faculty, then
himself.
Tech argues that the department
didn't define "timely" until 2009,
when it added regulations to require
immediate notification upon confir-
mation of a dangerous situation or
immediate threat to people on cam-

"Both the law and purpose-
ful reasoned analysis require that
the actions of that day be evalu-
ated according to the information
that was available to the university
and its professionals at that time,"
Hincker said. "Anything else loses
sightoftheunthinkable andunprec-
edented nature of what occurred."
But the report says the depart-
ment has consistently stated that
the determination of whether a
warning is timely is based on the
nature of the crime and the continu-
ing danger to the campus.
"The fact that an unknown shoot-
er might be loose on campus made
the situation an ongoing threat at
that time, and it remained a threat
until the shooter was apprehended,"
the report said.
A state commission impaneled to
investigate the shootings also found
that the university erred by failing
to notify the campus sooner. The
state reached an $1 million settle-
ment with many of the victims'
families. Two families have filed a
$10 million civil lawsuitagainstuni-
versity officials.
One victim's mother said she was
glad theuniversity finally faced pun-
ishment for its actions, but she took
more satisfaction from the inclusion
in the report of actions officials took
to protect themselves that morning.
Victims' families had long wanted
those details included in a separate
reportby the state panel.

Former Gov. Sarah Palm to visit
Haiti to aid humanitarian effort

Palen to travel to
Haiti this weekend
with reverend
JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) - For-
mer Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin
plans to visit Haiti amid a period
of political upheaval this week-
end to aid humanitarian efforts
in the Caribbean country.
A Palin staffer confirmed
yesterday that Palin, the 2008
vice presidential nominee and a
potential 2012 presidential con-

tender, planned to travel to Haiti
with the Rev. Franklin Graham
as part of the outreach of his
Samaritan's Purse relief organi-
zation.
A spokeswoman for the group
confirmed Palin planned to visit
relief sites this weekend.
A cholera outbreak has killed
more than 2,000 people in Haiti,
a country that is still recovering
from a devastating earthquake
earlier this year and is in the
midst of a disputed presidential
election.
Gunfire and barricades were

reported yesterday in the capital
city of Port-au-Prince, and the
U.S. State Department reissued
a travelwarning to the country
and recommended against non-
essential travel.
Graham said he appreciates
Palin's willingness to visit Haiti
during such troubled times.
"I believe Gov. Palin will be
a great encouragement to the
people of Haiti and to the orga-
nizations, both government and
private, working so hard to pro-
vide desperately needed relief,"
he said in a statement.

Snyder discusses
Michigan job
growth at WSU
When Gov.-elect Rick Snyder
attended a recent seminar for new
governors, he received a personal-
ized folder for Michigan with esti-
mates showing his state will be
among the nation's worst for job
growth during the next five years.
The numbers are now on his desk
and in the hands of his staff mem-
bers - and providing his incoming
administration another rallying
cry for the economically struggling
state.
"This is a piece of fiction - this is
not what's going to happen," he said
yesterday to an audience of Detroit
college students, faculty and busi-
ness and community leaders. "We
are going to beat the living day-
lights of out it."
Wayne State University's School
of Business Administration- and
Department of Accounting invited
the Ann Arbor executive, entre-
preneur and first certified public
accountant to be elected governor
of Michigan to speak about rein-
venting the state's economy - with
an accounting twist.

Two Michigan congressmen are
officially switching roles on the
House Ways and Means Commit-
tee.
Chairman Sander Levin of Royal
Oak announced yesterday he's been
selected to serve as the committee's
ranking member in the next Con-
gress.
On Wednesday, Dave Camp of
Midland said his fellow Republi-
cans had chosen him to chair Ways
and Means.
Levin says he's "pleased to have
received a vote of confidence" from
the members of the Democratic
caucus.
The brother of Sen. Carl Levin
took over in March as chairman of
the Ways and Means Committee
after New York Rep. Charles Ran-
gel stepped aside amid questions
over his fundraising and finances.
LONDON
Students attack
Prince Charles in
tuition hike protest
Furious student protesters
attacked a car carrying Prince
Charles and his wife, Camilla,
vandalized buildings and battled
riot police yesterday as a con-
troversial hike in university fees ,
triggered Britain's worst political
violence in years.
In a major security breach,
demonstrators set upon the heir
to the throne's Rolls Royce as
it drove through London's busy
West End on its way to a theater.
A group of up to 20 struck it with
fists, sticks and bottles, break-

ing a window and splattering the
gleamingblackvehicle with paint.
In the frenzy, some chanted
"off with their heads!"
Adnan Nazir, a 23-year-old
podiatrist who was following
the protesters, said Charles, 62,
kept his calm, gently pushing his
63-year-old wife toward the floor
to get her out of the line of fire.
"Charles got her on the floor
and put his hands on her," Nazir
said. "Charles was still waving
and giving the thumb's up.

President faces
sanctions from U.S.
The United States warned Lau-
rent Gbagbo that he faces punitive
sanctions if he continues to refuse
to step down following a disputed
election that the United Nations
says were won by his opponent.
The African Union, meanwhile,
suspended Ivory Coast's member-
ship yesterday in the latest sign of
growing pressure against the coun-
try's former president.
Gbagbo has not spoken publicly
since his rushed inauguration over
the weekend, after he rejected
the results released by his coun-
try's electoral commission which
showed that the opposition leader
Alassane Ouattara had won by
a nearly 10-point margin. Those
results were certified by the United

rent policy denies transgender stu-
dents the same amount of access to
campus housing as the rest of the
student body."
LSA senior Rebecca Egler,
ACLU's representative on the
Open Housing Initiative, echoed
the sentiments expressed by Jones
and in the letter, adding that an
open housing policy would espe-
cially benefit transgender stu-
dents.
"Its implementation would pro-
vide a more equitable housing sys-
tem through an increase of options
that are more aware of the mul-
tiplicity of student needs on this
campus," she wrote in an e-mail
interview yesterday.
According to a press release
issued by the University's chapter
of the ACLU, similar housing poli-
cies have been enacted at 36 other
colleges and universities across
the country.
The press release also stated

"the University of Michigan has
the opportunity to lead the Big
Ten on this issue ... by making the
residence halls a comfortable com-
munity for all students."
Egler wrote that so far, adminis-
trators have responded positively
to the report. At this time, though,
the initiative is still under consid-
eration.
Social Work graduate student
Allison Horky, a member of the
Open Housing Initiative and a
member of the Spectrum Cen-
ter's Student Advisory Board, said
members involved in the initiative
will be meeting with administra-
tors on Monday.
"(We've) gotten a positive
response (from administrators),"
Horky said. "We're all working
together to try and figure out what
other information we need, and
what we can do as far as imple-
mentation."
Jones said she and fellow mem-
bers of the ACLU will continue
encouraging the policy if it isn't
enacted next year.
"We're waiting to hear what

administrators say about what's
practical and for a timeline," she
said. "If (the Open Housing Ini-
tiative and University Housing)
agree, logistics need to be worked
out."
Egler wrote thatnmembers of the
ACLU hope to facilitate education
and dialogue about the issue in
upcoming months and work along-
side University Housing if the pro-
posal is enacted.
"In order to ensure a smooth
transition if the policy is enacted,
the ACLU and the rest of the Open
Housing Initiative will work side-
by-side with housingto implement
these options in a way that contin-
ues to uphold the Living at Michi-
gan Credo," Egler wrote.
Other studentcgroups on campus
have also expressed support for
the initiative. In April, the Univer-
sity's Residence Halls Association
passed a resolution supporting the
addition of a gender-neutral hous-
ing option. In addition, the Michi-
gan Student Assembly passed a
resolution in December 2009 in
support of the proposal.

TAXIS
From Page 1A
vehicles, which Fowler describes
as "one of the two largest fleets
in the area." According to Fowl-
er, the company generates about
$1.5 million a year in profits.
Preston Woodward, a driver for
Ann Arbor Yellow Cab, expressed
similar positivity regarding the
city's market for taxis. Wood-
ward's business card denotes him
as "King o'the Cabbies."
"Clearly there's a market, a
big market for taxi cabs here,"
Woodward said, adding that
Ann Arbor's demand for taxis
allows for a variety of compa-
nies to co-exist in the area.
"There's a lot of businesses to
go around," Woodward said.
Woodward also noted that
Ann Arbor's taxi license process
allows for easy access into the
taxi business.
"It's very easy, and very inex-
pensive,"Woodward said.
With so much business to go
around, many taxi companies
and drivers develop personali-
ties of their own to distinguish
themselves. While waiting for
customers in front of Hill Audi-
torium, Woodward plays the

accordion. The Lady "M" Sedan
Transportation Services driver
known as "Mustang Sally" -
Mryna Ismail - has decorated
the exterior of her cab with
pictures of mustangs, and often
plays the song that inspired her
nickname.
LSA freshman Sami Hayek, a
frequent taxi rider, said she has
a specific driver she calls when
she needs a ride. Hayek said she
thinks students are comfort-
able taking taxis around the city
because Ann Arbor taxi drivers
are particularly aware of stu-
dents' transportation needs.
"I think they are very in tune
with (the fact that) kids that need
to get around and don't necessar-
ily have cars," Hayek said.
Hayek also noted that taxi
drivers are particularly conve-
nient for students that may have
consumed alcohol.
"Drivers are aware that kids
may be drinking and (do) a good
service by giving them a safe
ride home," Hayek said.
According to the website of
the Ann Arbor Area Convention
and Visitors Bureau, taxis may
not be hailed from a curb, but
are often available for hire at
popular landmarks throughout
Ann Arbor.


TICKETS
From Page 1A
general admission seating in the
student section. The Athletic
Department sent an e-mail to
all student ticket holders in July,
however, to tell students about a
change in the policy.
"We originally indicated that
student seating would be gen-
eral admission within the stu-
dent area," the e-mail read. "Due
to our experience with general
admission seating at graduation
in May, we have decided to use
reserved seating for this event.
This will ensure your seats for
this once in a lifetime special
event."
Now, students who bought
their Big Chill tickets in conjunc-
tion with their football season
tickets will be seated in the same
location as their football groups.
Students who bought their
tickets with their hockey season
tickets will be seated with their
hockey se'ating group in section
33 - located in the north end
zone.
Finally, those who purchased
additional tickets will be seated
in sections in the end zone bor-
dering the student section.
Kinesiology and LSA junior
Steve Davenport said he bought
extra tickets for his family and
was disappointed when he real-
ized he wouldn't be able to sit

with them at the game.
"I bought seven extra tickets
because in case they were sepa-
rate I knew (my family) would
be sitting together, but I'm also
sitting with my football seat-
ing group," Davenport said. "So,
I knew if I wasn't sitting with
them I'd have someone to sit
with. I was hoping they'd be sit-
ting with us."
LSA senior Jasmine Hentschel
said a friend bought her a ticket
because she was abroad when the
tickets went on sale last spring.
She said the fact that their tickets
weren't together would be a nui-
sapce, but wouldn't deter them
from sitting together at the game.
"That's going to be a pain,"
Hentschel said of the seats being
in different sections. "I'm sure
we'll figure it out though the
same way that people do with
football (games), unless that's
not possible for some reason, but
I can't imagine that that will be
the case."
Meanwhile, LSA sophomore
Nicole McIntyre said she didn't
realize that a Big Chill ticket
came with her football season
tickets, so she bought an extra
ticket herself. Once she real-
ized that she had the ticket that
game with her football tickets,
McIntyre said she planned to
give the extra ticket to a friend
to sit with them, but due to the
change in policy she changed her
plans.

"It'd be better if it was in the
same section because then I
wouldn't have to sell it to a ran-
dom person," McIntyre said.
Still, Ablauf said the Athletic
Department has only received
a handful of formal complaints
from students.
"We got a few inquiries, but
I'd say fewer than 20-30 and they
understood once we explained
again the information in the
e-mail," Ablauf wrote. "Since
every student with a football
season ticket received their same
location for the Big Chill, we
obviously couldn't assign their
additional tickets next to their
football ticket."
The game is sold out and the
stands at the Big House are
expected to be filled to their
capacity of 109,901. According to
Ablauf, 26,000 of those tickets
are held by students.
An e-mail sent out to all stu-
dent ticket holders Wednesday
morning said there were approx-
imately 3,000 student tickets
that had yet to been picked up
from the Athletic Department's
Ticket Office at 1000 S. State St.
Tickets are available for pick-
up today at the ticket office from
8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. and will also
be available tomorrow at Crisler
Arena. The e-mail encouraged
students to pick up their tickets
at least 90 minutes prior to face-
off in order to avoid long lines
and arrive at the game on time.


DREAM
From Page 1A
with the result. She said those
who spoke both for and against
the legislation made solid argu-
ments.
As a supporter of the bill,
Pedraza highlighted the signifi-
cance of the Republican vote. She
said that while only eight House
Republicans voted for the bill -
five of whom were Hispanic -
20 Republicans abstained from
voting altogether, meaning they
weren't necessarily against the
legislation.
John Garcia, director of the
Resource Center for Minor-
ity Data and the community
outreach director for the Inter-
University Consortium for
Political and Social Research,
said that by abstaining from the
vote, Republicans who have high
Hispanic populations in their
districts could save face by not
offending their constituents out-
right.
"It would be interesting to look
at the Republicans who abstained
and look at what their districts
look like," Garcia said.
Garcia said he views the
DREAM Act as "a kind of a
potential shift away from immi-
gration as exclusively a security,
law enforcement issue" to a more
social and educational issue.
The Senate voted 59-40 yester-
day to table the bill for one week.
Since the legislation was filibus-
tered in the past, it will need a
60-vote majority to receive a vote
from the Senate.
Garcia speculated that the
postponement was a strategic
move by Democrats to buy more
time to rally support from Repub-
lican senators by highlighting the
economic benefits of the bill or
emphasizing the threat of losing
support from Hispanic constitu-
ents.
Pedraza said the DREAM Act's
success in the Senate may depend
on more than just the bill's own
merits. Compromises made
between President Barack Obama
and Congressional Republicans
on tax cuts may play a significant
role in persuading Republicans
to vote for the DREAM Act, she
said.
"That's not fair to the DREAM
Act ... the DREAM Act has been

discussed for ten years," she
said. "That's very dirty politics I
think."
Garcia said he also thinks bi-
partisan compromises will play
a role in the debate. Especially
after Obama made concessions
on the tax cuts, Garcia said, the
president might try to "keep that
give-and-take kind of sentiment
out there."
In a statement released by the
White House Office of the Press
Secretary, Obama voiced his two-
pronged support for the bill.
"This vote is not only the right
thing to do for a group of talented
young people who seek to serve a
country they know as their own
by continuing their education or
serving in the military," Obama
wrote, "but it is the right thing
for the United States of America."
He cited a report from the
Congressional Budget Office that
found the DREAM Act would cut
the nation's deficit by $2.2 billion
dollars over ten years.
Addressing Speaker of the
House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)
Wednesday, U.S. Congressmen
John Dingell (D-Mich.) said he
supports the bill because it would
help students who didn't decide
on their own to come to this
country illegally.
"The DREAM Act will provide
opportunity and hope to young
immigrants brought to this coun-
try by their parents who, through
no fault of their own, cannot be
a meaningful part of our soci-
ety without this Act," he said
in his address, according to a
press release issued by Dingell's
office. "Most of these individu-
als speak English as well or bet-
ter than their native tongue and
they consider the United States
their home, but they cannot real-
ize their dreams because of their
immigration status."

Dingell highlighted how the
bill will ultimately benefit the
country as a whole by allowing
a greater number of eager, young
individuals to boost the power of
the U.S. military and contribute
to the college-educated work-
force, according to the press
release. Additionally, he added
that the bill will also expand the
overall federal, state and local
tax base.
Dingell emphasized that his
support for the legislation came
only after months of careful
deliberation.
I am tired of throwing
patches at the immigration prob-
lem," he said that what this coun-
try truly needs is comprehensive
immigration reform. While
he said the DREAM Act is yet
another "small patch," the young
people targeted by the bill should
not be "held hostage" while the
government works toward large-
scale reform, according to the
press release.
Some of the young individu-
als impacted by the legislation
gathered Wednesday night to
watch the House vote on C-Span
with Sam Nawrocki, head of the
Migrant and Immigrant Rights
Advocacy group on campus.
"I watched the vote with a
group of undocumented stu-
dents," Nawrocki said. "We're all
very surprised and very excited
about the House's vote :.. but
very much know it's only the first
step."
Narwocki said she and other
members of the "youth-led move-
ment" advocating for the DREAM
Act called Dingell and other con-
gressmen to rally support for the
bill leading up to last night's vote.
Now that the legislation is before
the Senate, she said her and oth-
ers will reorganize and continue
to make calls over the next week.

Let them eat veggies
Schools must implement healthy eating plans
Efforts toward addressing the simultaneous problems of
child obesity rates and child hunger in the United States
recently made landmark progress. Last week, the U.S.
House of Representatives passed a child nutrition bill that will
overhaul school lunch programs. The bill, which was lobbied
for by First Lady Michelle Obama, will help schools expand free
lunch programs and impose stricter regulations on nutritional
standards. The bill will now go to President Barack Obama, who
is expected to sign it into law. This bill should be the beginning of
an increased effort to teach children healthy eating habits. Most
importantly, it should ensure that all children have a lunch.


Anti-bias blun

After passing unanimously in the U.S.
Senate in August, the House of Representa-
tives gave approval on Dec. 2 to a $4.5-bil-
lion child nutrition bill to subsidize healthier
school lunches. Half of the bill will be funded
through significant cuts to the current food
stamp program that will take effect in a few
years. The bill aims to feed more children
and put healthier foods in schools. Schools
will receive greater subsidies for free lunch-
es for children from low-income households.
The bill will also increase fruits and vegeta-
bles in schools and includes regulations on
what can be served in vending machines.
The emphasis on healthy eating is a cru-
cial aspect of this program. Having more
fruits and vegetables in meals and fewer
empty-calorie, processed foods available
will hopefully put a dent in child obesity
rates. About 17 percent of children are
obese, according to a 2007-2008 study from
the Centers for Disease Control. And hope-
fully, introducing students to healthy choic-
es will encourage them to continue healthy
eating habits when they are adults, helping
to decrease the number of obese Americans
-which currently sits at about 34 percent,
accordingto the CDC report.
Not only does the bill make school lunches
healthier, it also makes them more widely

T here's a campaignbeingmount-
ed in South Quad. From the
community center to the eleva-
tor lobby, a move-
ment is growing.
You may not
have known, but
the fight against
prejudice and
intolerance is
being waged on
Central Campus..
From the moment -
you enter South TYLER
Quad, you are JONES
bombarded with
a barrage of some
of the best tactics
this anti-prejudice caapaig nhasito
offer: posters. Some are small with
subtle messages like "Spread Love."
Other, significantly larger ban-
ners are less discrete. And then, of
course, there was (until recently) the
infamous banner located in the east
lobby of South Quad. This billboard
of bias broadcasted to the world just
how many days it had been since the
last bias incident occurred in South
Quad - that way, students and cam-
pus tours alike could be constantly
informed of just how vigorously the
Residence Hall Council was combat-
ing prejudice.
So imagine my surprise last month
when my resident advisor sent a mass
e-mail to my hall informing us of the
recent string of bias incidents. How
could this be? How did this no-holds-
barred campaign to root out intoler-
ance allow for not just onebias incident,
but a whole slew? Perhaps it's because
prejudice and deep-seated intolerance
can't be combated with peace signs on
flyers or rainbows on banners.
The Bias Incident Hotline defines
a bias incident as a targeted affront
against a particular group with the
intent to cause mental, emotional,
physical or spiritual harm. Put sim-
ply, we're talking about prejudice.
Providing a safe environment for all

students must be the first priority of
the University. I commend the ongo-
ing awareness campaign that seeks
to shed light on prejudice. But in the
effort to create a safe environment for
students, it's important thatweunder-
stand the enemy we're fighting.
Prejudice isn't just a swastika on a
whiteboard or a friend dropping the
word "gay" in conversation. Rather,
this is the product of years of igno-
rance with no desire to understand
those who are different and a lack of
respect for those who lead an alterna-
tive lifestyle.
Activists devote their careers to
understanding prejudice and search-
ing for methods to combat it. But the
tactics employed by the Anti-Bias
Committeepseem unusual. Accord-
ing to South Quad Hall Council
President Valerie Juan's blog, the
campaign developers hoped "that a
change in the attitudes of South Quad
residents could eventually lead to an
even greater impact." This is truly an
admirable goal, but let's takea look at
just how it is being implemented.
Juan goes on to explain, "Using
motivational posters, flyers, t-shirts,
and buttons, the committee encour-
ages South Quad residents to stand
up and speak out against bias inci-
dents." Slogans like "WTF: Why the
Frase?" and "Words have impact:
make yours positive" are also at the
front lines. I can't help but think that
if stopping prejudice and intoler-
ance were as easy as a one-liner on
a t-shirt, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
would've had a much easier march on
Washington, D.C.
Then there was the banner count-
ing how many days it had been since
the last bias incident. Like a welcome
mat, this banner was the first thing
most people saw when they entered
South Quad. I never saw the count on
that poster go more than seven days.
All the banner accomplished was act
as a constant reminder of how inef-
fective this campaign is. The cam-

ders
paign developers should take a hard
look at their strategy if South Quad
can't go more than a week without
some inappropriate whiteboard art.
I commend the Hall Council and
"Anti-Bias Committee" for taking on
this problem. But in this case, it's not
too difficult to discern real substan-
tive action from painted rust. Ulti-
mately, no clever banner will erase
the prejudices of a bigot, nor will my
t-shirt push a silly teenager to con-
sider his or her words more carefully.
No clever slogan
will erase the
prejudice of a bigot.
I don't know how to stop prejudice
- and I think acknowledging that is
a necessary first step. Until we stop 4
pretending to know which direction
is correct, we will continue to wan-
der aimlessly. It seems the founders
of this campaign operated under the
assumption that it's better to do any-
thing than nothing at all. This mind-
set is dangerous because it creates
the illusion that real progress is being
made. Until we can acknowledge that
we simply don't know what to do, no
real solutions can be developed.
Instead, I say let's acknowledge
that we don't know how to stop preju-
dice. Let's take a look at our society as
a whole - not just South Quad resi-
dents - and try to understand why
we continue to produce prejudice and
intolerance. Until we can acknowl-
edge that we don't know how to solve
this problem, I fear the best we will
have to offer society is clever t-shirts
and good intentions.

available. The program also automatically
qualifies children on Medicaid for the pro-
gram, increasing the number of children
who receive free lunch. By offering schools
greater subsidies for free lunches, more stu-
dents who may have previously gone without
will have lunch.
But this program shouldn't come at the
expense of other people who receive gov-
ernment aid for food: the cuts to funding
for food stamps were a serious concern
to House Democrats who ultimately sup-
ported the bill. But since there's still time
to alter the bill before cuts take effect and
the approaching Republican takeover of
the House, it was a sacrifice they had to
make. But it shouldn't become permanent.
Congressional Democrats should work
with the Obama administration to protect
funding for food stamps and also provide
students with healthy lunches.
Curbing childhood obesity and malnutri-
tion rates has the potential to dramatically
change the lives of a generation of young
Americans. Obama needs to sign the child
nutrition bill to begin establishing a healthy
lifestyle for children in public schools - but
he and Congressional Democrats shouldn't
let other struggling families down to fund
the program.

We've all heard about carbon footprints, glob-
al climate change and the environmental evils
of gas-guzzling SUVs. Odds are, however, that
what we've heard has gained little traction in our
lives. Perhaps we recycle more than we used to
or skimp a bit more on heating than before. But
in the end, we just haven't seen enough tangible
information to motivate change.
What if it was possible to calculate the envi-
ronmental impact of the average University stu-
dent in a line item-by-line item analysis of his or
her day? While determination of the "average"
may be subject to conjecture, the quantitative
impacts of specific activities are actually quite
simple to calculate. After being empowered with
theinformation presented inthefollowinganaly-
sis, what willyou do to reduce your daily environ-
mental impact?
Economic Input-Output Life Cycle Assess-
ment (which we refer to as EIO-LCA) is a meth-
od that can be used to relate economic data and
environmental outputs. As we calculated a stu-
dent's average day, we focused on the emissions
produced during the use of products rather
than considering the complete impact, which
also includes manufacturing and disposal. We
only counted activities that a student could
directly change.
For instance, lighting in a shared computer lab
wasn't counted but lighting in a house was. Using
Carnegie Mellon University's EIO-LCA web tool,
we calculated the tons of Carbon Dioxide Equiv-
alent Emissions - or CDEE - emitted per unit
electrical consumption and distribution. Michi-
gan's electricity is generated by both nuclear- and
carbon-based fuel sources, significantly impact-
ing CDEE per kilowatt-hour. The ratios of these
sources were considered and the cost of electric-
ity and natural gas was calculated using a com-
posite of averaged values from typical Detroit
Edison Energy utility bills. Seasonal variations in
usage were also accounted for.
What does an average day look like? Wake up
in the morning, unplug the cell phone from the
charger, turn on the coffee pot and make toast
and eggs. Use the toilet, take a 10-minute shower
and brushyour teeth (turningthefaucetoffwhile
brushing). Power a desktop computer at school,
microwave lunch, print a few pages and turn on
a desk lamp and an office light. We assumed the
average student also plays video games, watches

TV, cooks dinner and once each week does laun-
dry. Throughout the day, the student indirectly
uses hot water heaters, refrigerators and elec-
tronic devices that remain plugged in while not
in use. In addition, students use air conditioning
in the summer and gas heating in the winter.
What does this average day mean environmen-
tally? The electrical usage of the average student
results in almost 7 tons of CDEE emitted over one
year while the water usage produces a scant.OS of
a ton of CDEE per year. If students drive the typi-
cal 15,000 miles a year in a car that gets 24 miles
per gallon, they also produce 5.6 tons of CDEE for
a conservative composite annual total of 12.6 tons
CDEE pollutants.
Let's define a more sustainable student. Sus-
tainability Sally takes the bus and rides her bike.
She uses 15-watt light bulbs, turns off her com-
puter when she's not usingitand opens a window
instead of using air conditioning. Lastly, she uses
a programmable thermostat in order to minimize
the time her furnace is running. By altering her
lifestyle, Sally saves enough electricity to power
the average American home for four months. The
emissions she doesn't produce allow her to drive
a Toyota Prius around the world twice before
matching the average student's CDEE.
If everyone in the world lived like the "aver-
age" student, the earth's temperature would rise
by 0.1 degrees Celsius each year. A mere four-
degree Celsius global temperature increase is
expected to have catastrophic effects, accord-
ing to a 2006 Stern Review on the Economics
of Climate Change. If everyone lived like Sally,
the temperature increase would be reduced by
almost 74 percent.
Let's be honest. A single student's projected
temperature change impact is 0.00000000001
degrees Celsius per year. That's not much on any
scale. But we have seen the impact of collective
behavior and it is nontrivial. You have the data.
You know what simple changes you can make to
your lifestyle. The question remains, what will
you change?

t seems like it's been constant
crunch time since a week or two
before Thanksgivingbreak. There
have been papers to
write, applications
to update, projects
to complete and
advising appoint-;
ments and office
hours to attend.
The computer
viruses, the real '
viruses, the dishes
and dirty clothes VANESSA
and of course the
inability to take RYCHLINSKI
proper care of
myself - every-.
thing has been slowly increasing in
pressure like a bad head cold.
A night not too long ago, I was
banging around in my kitchen in a
state of annoyance, trying to be an
adult about things and pull together
a meal. "Dinner" ended up being a
plate of half-cooked hash browns.
As I shoved the ice-covered rock
of shredded potatoes back into my
freezer, I almost missed the new
magnet sentences. Visitors usually
like to arrange our word magnets
either in cutesy or imaginatively sug-
gestive ways, since we only have pro-
nouns, basic verbs and boring words
like "friend" or "star." But anyway, as
I said, these new sentences I hadn't
seen yet, and there was a short one
right by the freezer handle that said:
"You have time."
"Yeah, okay," I said as sarcastically
as I could to my stupid fridge and the
stupid word magnets. I stalked away to
eat my semi-rawpotatoeswith a liberal
amount of ketchup and I didn't think
about the sentence again until later.
A year ago, as a first-semester

freshman, I had so much time. I look
back on those happy days with fond
remembrance. I also wasn't excited
in the least about returning home
for Thanksgiving break. This year, I
couldn't wait. My last class ended and
I ran to my car before happily driv-
ing off to my parents' house where I
wouldn't have to do any homework or
try to cook for myself.
The day after Thanksgiving, my
mom, aunt, two cousins and I headed
over to my grandparents' house to
spend the day learning to make chr-
usciki, or angel wings, which are a
traditional pastry made out of dough
that's been twisted into ribbons, deep-
fried and covered in powdered sugar.
My grandma has perfected the recipe
over SO years or so and decided it was
time that more people in the family
learned how to make them. Chrus-
ciki are usually made for holidays or
special events because the process is
time-consuming and has some deli-
cate steps. Last year, unenthusiastic
as I was to be back, I probably would
have been annoyed at spending any
time with any family whatsoever.
But this year was different. Spend-
ing the day watching my youngest
cousin make a mess with the pow-
dered sugar, my aunt worrying about
the dough burning, my grandma
patiently supervising and my mom
just being my mom was priceless.
Even though I probably should have
been working on a project that day, I'm
glad I didn't. Instead, I got to banter
with my 14-year-old cousin, who's just
so smart now because she's in high
school (as soon as I said that, she shot
back with "You think you're so smart
just because you're in college!"). I got
to gossip with my aunt and my mom
and talk about - what else - my aca-

demic future. I got to see my grandpar-
ents without the pretense of a holiday
or someone's birthday. I learned how
to make chrusciki the Rychlinski way,
which makes a the final product unlike
anything from any store.
It's especially easy to get tied up
right now as the semester comes to a
close and there seems to be no time
for anything. Deadlines creep up on
us like the sunsets at five o'clock while
family and friends are set to the side
as a result. The University's last day
of finals is Dec. 23 - later than almost E
every other college in the state.

One by the
freezer said,
"You have time:'
But I think back to my magnets
that some random person arranged
into the sentence - "You have time"
- and I think that even though I feel
like I barely have time to do my home-
work, sleep, or thaw out some pota-
toes, I can fit in the important stuff.
So I guess it's up to you to figure out
what that stuff is. So whether you're
done on Dec. 13 or Dec. 23, hang in
there for a little while longer. Warm
up, chill out, but most of all just take
some time.
But then again, maybe someone
should buy me a dirty magnet set for
Christmas so I'll stop getting philo-
sophical at the fridge.

Daft Punk's big.'Legacy'

written by Jeff at 7p.m.
Goode, the idol- WalgreenDrama
ized and peace- Center,StudioOne
ful environment Free
of the North Pole
is tarnished forever as Vixen, a
reindeer who pulls Santa's sleigh,
reports that Santa has been sexu-
ally harassing Rudolph. As the
news spreads, reporters swamp
the scene and each rejndeer each
reveals an account of the scandal,
often veering off topic and focus-
ing on their own issues.
"It's eight monologues, so it's
funny - you don't get to see the
reindeer interact at all," said
director Emma Donson, a junior
in the School of Music, Theatre &
Dance. "At least from what I feel
directing, you will know their
relationships based on what they
say and who they talk about. It's
pretty known how they feel about
each other."
In their monologues, the rein-
deer reveal their quirks to the
audience as well as their underly-
ing humanity, regardless of their
fur and antlers. Comet is a reborn
Muslim, Cupid proudly gay and
Prancer a producer who worked
on his own film, "Prancer." At
the same time, Vixen's best friend
Blitzen defends her in a press
conference and Rudolph's father,

Donner, painfully regrets selling
Rudolph to Santa.
"Dancer ... is very skittish.
She used to be a ballet instruc-
tor and she's a Jewish reindeer,"
said Ariel Sobel, a sophomore in
the School of MT&D who plays
Dancer. "When she first comes up
for her interview, she talks about
her vacation days and her sick
days, but she only works one day
a year."
Donson first performed Blit-
zen's monologue for Janet Zar-
ish from New York University's
Tisch School of the Arts, who
came to the University to speak
with the acting program. Zarish's
encouragement pushed Donson
to produce the show for Base-
ment Arts.
"She was really wowed and
hadn't heard of the play or the
material," Donsonsaid. "Ithought
to myself, 'if she's wowed by this ...
Hide your kids,
hide your wife,
Santa's coming.
I think it's a good play to do.'"
Donson, an acting major, used
Basement Arts as a gateway' to
experiment with directing, and
found the Studio One atmosphere
helpful for her^ show. Sobel has
also found this space beneficial as
an actress.
"I think especially with the
monologues, they're pretty long
and for me to connect with the
audience and whoever I'm speak-
ing to for that long amount of
time, it's helpful to have that

French duo ditches
the rave and recruits
an orchestra
By CHLOE STACHOWIAK
For theDaily
With Tron: Legacy, the
soundtrack for the new Disney
movie that opens Dec 17, Daft
Punk unleashes
its electronic
power once
again. A film Daft Punk
pivoting on tech-
nology, digital Tron: Legacy
effects and the Walt Disney
virtual world, it's
no wonder direc-
tor Joseph Kosinski chose the
French duo for the job: their elec-
tro-house dance music has graced
clubs and raves since the early
1990s, and they've even racked up
a few Grammys.
The jolt of Tron: Legacy, how-
ever, is a far leap from past hits

like "One More Time" and "Tech-
nologic" that commonly blast
through swarms of partiers at
night clubs. While the soundtrack
is composed with Daft Punk's
well-known precision and French
house influences, it showcases a
new depth and maturity, as well
as an 85-piece orchestra. This
change may come as a shock to
glow stick-waving rave kids, but
to everyone else, the soundtrack
is musical bliss, a blend of mighty
sounds and emotions woven
together in intricacy.
Daft Punk's development of
sound is evident in the very first
track, "Overture," opening the
album with slow, passionate vio-
lins and throaty horns. The inten-
sity gradually builds throughout
the song, transforming into a
crescendo of crashing symbols.
It seethes tragedy and strength
without sounding over the top
- everything one would hope to
hear during a Disney movie about
cyber battles in a digital universe.
"Outlands" also features

this internal maturation, as the
track's opening violin part is met
with the deep cries of the bass
drum and brass section. What
was initially a quiet string part is
pumped up with the force of an
entire orchestra, and the layers
fuse together with fury. "Recog-
nizer" operates similarly giving
birth to energy between the dif-
ferent textures of music. In these
contexts, it's hard not to imagine
virtual battles between heroes
and super villains: the frantic
violins and solid bass drum vio-
lently rage against one another
with every beat.
Still, it's impossible for a die-
hard Daft Punk fan to listen to the
soundtrack without feeling some
sense of longing for the group's
typical music; the album bears
few similarities to the duo's dance
albums. These tracks just don't
have the same peppy vibe as past
work and the intensity can almost
feel a bit weighty at times. But
tracks like "Derezzed" and "End
of the Line" help to counteract

this, with the fiery beats and syn-
thesizer parts that brought Daft
Punk to popularity in the first
place. None of these songs are as
upbeat or dance-worthy as the
artists' past work, but they offer
light, rhythmic relief from the
heavy currents charging through
the rest of the album.
Parisian clubbers may be
mourning the loss of a new week-
end dance mix, but as far as the big
screen is concerned, Tron: Legacy
is far from a power failure. It
delivers the ferocity and storm of
sentiment expected from a major
motion picture, charged with
excitement without feeling forced.
Each track flows cohesively with-
out sounding monotonous, con-
stantly changing and challenging
the last with new layers of beats
and sounds.

A war of words erupts
in MT&D's'Much Ado'

By STEPHEN OSTROWSKI
DailyArts Writer
If gossip is the currency of a col-
lege campus, then William Shake-
speare's "Much
Ado About Noth-
ing," brimming Much Ado
with he-said About

tion and beguile- Nothfg

& Dance.
The Messina,
Italy-based comedy, to be show-
cased this weekend at the Power
Center, features a dichotomous set
of relationships: Hero and Clau-
dio are fresh-faced lovers whose
relationship is threatened by the
destructive plot of a conniving
outsider. Meanwhile, the silver-

tongued, romantically unlinked
Beatrice and Benedick are
unknowingly subject to match-
making.
"Much Ado" director and
School of MT&D professor John
Neville-Andrews praised the
play's multiple dimensions.
"What I love about 'Much Ado
About Nothing' is that it has so
much variety in there," Neville-
Andrews said. "It's not just a
straight comedy. It's certainly not
a tragedy, although very tragic
events take place, and it's not just
a straight drama; it has all of that
in there."
School of MT&D junior Allison
Brown, who plays the witty Bea-
trice, detailed the comedic signifi-
cance of her character.
"She's definitely part of the comic
relief and part of the love story
within 'Much Ado,' " Brown said,
"because her and Benedick fight all
time, and they really end up loving
each other despite their wits."

Neville-Andrews further
acknowledged the anchoring
effect of the Beatrice/Benedick
dynamic, which he described as
"verbal jousting" in an e-mail to
the Daily.
Shakespeare
meets the 1920s.
"This merry war of words cre-
ates a great deal of enjoyment for
an audience because they recog-
nize the painful situation these
two lovers are in, but eagerly
anticipate a positive and romantic
ending," Neville-Andrews wrote.

In its second semester on cam-
pus, Salto Dance Company, com-
posed ofnine female students from
different disciplines, will pirou-
ette and jet6 as Sugarplum fairies,

Spanish hot chocolate, Arabian
coffee and other personified char-
acters from "The Nutcracker" in
their "A Winter Wonderland" per-
formance. Salto's first-ever holi-
day show will feature music from
Tchaikovsky's "The Nutcracker"
as well as other holiday songs, and
will incorporate a contemporary
dance style known as lyrical. Lyri-
cal uses the techniques of ballet as
a foundation but differs in that it
incorporates modern dance and
contemporary styles as well.
"When we started the group,
we sort of had the concept of the
winter show to .e half 'Nutcrack-
er,' half regular, more lyrical of
a show," said Anna Badalian, an
LSA junior and Salto's co-founder.

According to Badalian, the

smaller space," Sobel said.
"The Eight: Reindeer Mono-
logues" will include a variety of
accompanying elements that will
envelop theatergoers in the expe-
rience of the North Pole. Out-
side of the theater, there will be
improv performances and deco-
rative lights, as well as candy and
hot chocolate available for pur-
chase. In the holiday spirit, most
of the proceeds will go to the
Sexual Assault Prevention and
Awareness Center (SAPAC). Also,
during the performance, alterna-
tive Christmas soundtracks from
The Beach Boys to Fountains of
Wayne will be playing, and the
show will begin with a video
twisting clips from old Christmas
movies.
"I think it's important to enter-
tain an audience even before they
come into a space," Donson said.
"I've sat hours waiting for a show
to start, and you get frustrated
and want to go in, and you want
some sort of bang for your buck."

The set itself will bring the
audience deeper into the North
Pole, with many of the set materi-
als coming from cast donations.
"I haven't been calling it 'load
in.' Most people call moving
into the stage 'load in.' I'm call-
ing it, 'Hey, does anyone want to
help decorate Studio One with
me?' " said Charlotte Campbell,
the stage director and a junior in
the Schools of Engineering and
MT&D. "Essentially we're having
a Christmas tree and there's going
to be snow everywhere."
Being so close to finals week,
the collaborators of "The Eight:
Reindeer Monologues" hope that
the comedy can provide an enter-
taining break for busy students
while helping them look at the
approaching holiday season with
a different eye.
"It's very different, it's very
funny and it's really perfect
because of the commercialism
of Christmas and how we get
stuck in this wonderful time of
the year," Donson said. "There
are a lot of people who don't love
Christmas, and it's an interesting
spin on something we don't nor-
mally think about."

MUCH ADO

reserved personality in a venue
like the Power Center which,
according to its website, seats
more than 1,300 people.
"The character is very soft-
spoken and quiet, so that is a
kind of strange thing, is how to
balance creating this character
that's supposed to be very shy
and demure, but still be a large
enough character and interest-
ing enough character for people
to notice you on this big stage
with this huge set," Cousins said.
Also contributing to the
romantic crosscurrents is Don
Pedro, portrayed by School of
MT&D senior Paul Koch. Accord-
ing toKoch, Don Pedro (a prince)
serves as a rallying force for the
men in the production and who,
despite his arrogance, manifests
his own personal complexities.
"I think that kind of bombast,
that confidence, is a cover for
some other stuff," Koch said..
"And that's always interesting to
play; it's always really interesting

to play a character that is oscil-
lating on a number of different
levels."
Neville-Andrews noted that
a few modifications have been
to the play. Not only has "Much
Ado" been shortened for length,
but it also now takes place in
the 1920s. According to Neville-
Andrews, this gives a contex-
tual justification for the strong
female role of Beatrice and also
strengthens audience connection
to the production..
Still, Neville-Andrews observed,
the Shakespearian language has
not been modernized. According
to Koch, this requires actors to
provide a relatable performance
- one of "naturalism."
Though multiple storylines
pepper the narrative, Neville-
Andrews pointed to overarching,
noble themes touted by Shake-
speare.
"I think if there is any message
to be taken from 'Much Ado,' it's
don't judge people too quickly
or harshly, investigate anything
negative you're told before you
act and remember love, compas-
sion and truth will conquer all,"
Neville-Andrews wrote.

SALTO

nent because we both come from
ballet backgrounds," Badalian
said, referring to co-founder
Lizzi Shea, a senior in the School
of Nursing. "We wanted to dance
and puton shows, and wecouldn't
do that through the School of
Music, Theatre & Dance because
we're in LSA, so we started our
own group."
Badalian said many dance
groups at the University perform
one big show a year along with
smaller appearances at different
events. But Salto aims to produce
a show each semester. So far the
group has met that goal.
"We do a lot of numbers. We've
onlyhadtwoshows,buttheamount
of numbers we've had is really
ambitious," Badalian said. "The big
group numbers have everyone in

them, so we're constantly dancing
and never have abreak."
"We're still small and still
growing," she added.
Just as with its first show, Salto
will give a portion of the ticket
sales to charity. According to LSA
sophomore Aimde Vester, the
company will donate this semes-
ter's proceeds to the Jackson
School of the Arts, an organiza-
tion that offers art classes to chil-
dren without such opportunities.
This and the inspiration behind
"A Winter Wonderland" are both
deeply tied to the identity of Salto.
"I feel like this show really
encompasses who we are as a
group. We all have ballet back-
grounds but we also enjoy lyri-
cal," Badalian said. "The first half
is going back to our roots - really
ballet oriented dances - and the
second half is like our future as
dancers."
"It's what to look out for from
Salto," Vester added.

Boylen - an

the Crisler sideline for the first
time since his stints in East Lan-
sing. In his time with the-Spar-

NCAA Tournament five times
and the NIT once.
But Boylen has faced the Wol-
verines as a head coach before.
This game will mark the second
of a home-and-home series with
Utah. Last year, Utah ran away
with a 68-52 win in Salt Lake
City. In that game, despite Manny
Harris's 25 points, six rebounds
and four steals, the Wolverines
couldn't keep up with the Run-
nin' Utes, who finished the game
with a 13-1 run.
This year, Utah (6-2 overall) is
led by junior guard Will Clyburn,
who's in his first season there
after transferring from Mar-
shalltown Community College in
Iowa. The Detroit native is aver-
aging more than 20 points and
nine rebounds per game.

After years of star-filled rosters,
two 'M' captains start new era

By ANDREW HADDAD
Daily Sports Writer
For the last century, the Michi-
gan men's swimming program has
been symbolized by star power.
Tyler Clary. Peter and Alex
Vanderkaay. Tom Dolan. Eric
Namesnik. Chris Thompson. The
list goes on of ready-made super-
stars who came to Michigan and
experienced outstanding success
from the very beginning of their
careers, including winning Olym-
pic gold medals.
But this season, the symbol
of the Wolverines isn't a hotshot
recruit who was projected as a
future Olympian since middle
school. Instead, it's two lightly
recruited walk-ons who are now
the captains of one of the most sto-
ried swimming programs in the
nation.
Seniors Chris Douville and Neal
Kennedy each took different paths
to their respective leadership roles.
But they share a common bond of
hard work and sacrifice.
No. 6 Michigan fields its young-
est team ever this season, with 17
freshmen and just seven seniors.
With that in mind, Douville and
Kennedy's ability to spread that
type of work ethic onto the rest of
the team will be the key to wheth-
er Michigan can overcome their
unusual lack of superstars and
achieve their usual level of success.
Douville grew up in Dayton,
Ohio as a huge Michigan fan, with
his brother Nick swimming for the
Wolverines from 2002-05. But
coming out of high school, Chris
wasn't just too slow to receive a
scholarship at Michigan as a fresh-
man; he was too slow to even make
the team. Instead, he attended
Notre Dame for a year, delaying his
dream.
"I had always wanted to go
to Michigan," Douville said last
Thursday. "I improved enough in
my freshman year at Notre Dame
to qualify for Michigan, and once I
got my release (from Notre Dame),
the choice was easy."
But Douville still had a long way
to go once he arrived in Ann Arbor.
"When Chris got here, he wasn't
very good, truthfully," Michigan
coach Mike Bottom said. "I had no
real expectations for him."

But since then, Douville has
improved exponentially each year.
He's gone from essentially being a
reserve his sophomore season to
being expected to score in several
events at the Big Ten Champion-
ships this season.
"I never would have expected
this, especially coming out of high
school," Douville said. "But the
biggest key to my improvement, I
think, is that when I got to Michi-
gan, I looked at the best swim-
mers on the team, guys like Tyler
Clary and Matt Patton, and I said
to myself, 'What can I do to get
on their level?' I try to keep that
in mind through every single day,
every single practice, and every
single workout. I have to work
harder than other guys who might
be naturally faster than me."
Unlike his co-captain, Neal Ken-
nedy had his pick of virtually any
university in the country coming
out of high school. But he's faced a
lot of adversity in his college career
as well. He hardly competed his
freshman season and changed
events over the course of his time
in Ann Arbor. He went from spe-
cializing in the 400 individual
medley to becoming one of Michi-
gan's fastest swimmers in the 200
individual medley.
But despite all of that, he grew
substantially and won the team's
Most Improved Swimmer award
last season. He's now considered
one of the team's best performers
and says the key to such dramatic
improvement is humility.
"Mike Bottom has forgotten
more about swimming than I'll
ever know," Kennedy said. "So I've
always understood that I should
listen to what the coaches say."
After being named captain fol-
lowing last season, though, he
experienced one of his greatest set-
backs. A wakeboarding accident
over the summer led to a nagging
ankle injury that forced him to
miss the season's first two events,
in which the Wolverines suffered
a tie and a narrow loss. But he's
come back to swim at a high level
since.
"(Neal's injury) gave him some
time to reflect on just how impor-
tant swimming was to him," Bot-
tom said. "It's like shaking up a
coke can. He watched every meet
go by and go by, and once he finally
got his chance to swim, it popped."
Douville and Kennedy are great

friends now. But when they first
met, they butted heads.
"We're very different," Ken-
nedy said. "He's the business guy
who does all the hard work and
just pounds it out every day. I'm a
sprinter; I like to have fun, splash
around, make jokes. He's also more
intellectual, whereas I'm more
emotional. It took a little while
figuring out how to mesh together,
but he's one of my best friends now,
and I think it makes for a good bal-
ance as captains."
For the Wolverines to have any
chance of fulfilling their lofty
goals this season without the usual
superstars, the entire team will
need to work just as hard as Dou-
ville and Kennedy have in the last
four years.
The two captains have tried to
incorporate lessons they've learned
in their careers into their current
leadership approach. Remember-
ing how important the guidance of
older swimmers was to their devel-
opment, they've created a system
in which each freshman has a "big
brother" whom they meet with
regularly to serve as a mentor.
They also constantly emphasize
the value of work ethic to the fresh-
men - an example of this being
Kennedy's speech to the team at
the USA Swimming Minnesota
Grand Prix last month.
"On the last day of the competi-
tion, the whole team was exhaust-
ed and just thinking about getting
home," Kennedy said. "Nobody
seemed to care that much about
that last session. So I led the
stretch that day and went gung-ho
on everyone. I told them, 'Listen,
guys, you're tired, you're dead... but
you're going to have the same feel-
ing at Big Tens. You've got to work
harder and be more of a Michigan
Man if you're going to succeed
when it counts."'
In the annals of Michigan swim-
ming, the names of transcen-
dent stars like Clary, Vanderkaay,
Dolan, Namesnik and Thompson
roll off the tongue. Douville and
Kennedy will probably never have
times as good or win as many indi-
vidual championships as any of
those swimmers. But the stories
of their careers may be just as com-
pelling as any Olympian who swam
the lanes of Canham Natatorium.

T he legend begins in 2007.
The Michigan volleyball
team has just completed
its first week of practice when Ste-
sha Selsky walks into coach Mark
Rosen's office.
"Mark, I want to work on pass-
ing," Selsky tells her coach, as he
recalls it.
Though Selsky has played the
libero position earlier in her college
career, the senior is set to reprise
her role as aveteran setter who had
led the Wolverines to a 21-13 record
and a spot in the NCAA Tourna-
ment the previous year.
"Why do you want to work on
passing?" Rosen asks her, bemused.
Selsky smiles. "Really, Mark?
You know why I want to work on
passing.
"I want to be libero because
she's better than I am."
"She" is Lexi Zimmerman,
a scrappy freshman from Bar-
rington, Ill. who has been recruited
out of high school as the best setter
in the nation. She and Selsky have
been competing in practice to see
who would get the starting job for
the season opener against No. 10
Hawaii at the ASICS Invitational
Tournamet.
The competition is supposed to
be a formality, at least for the time
being. Whereas Selsky is a senior,
a veteran, and a solid setter, Zim-
merman is wide-eyed and untested
at the college level - an unknown.
It would be a huge risk to start a
freshman against a team that has
"future national champs" on their
t-shirts, in an arena full of 7,000
hostile fans.
So when Zimmerman earns the
starting nod after the first week of
practice, eyebrows are raised.
"Our seniors ... didn't feel like we
were making the right decision,"
Rosen recalls. "They were worried
about havingthis freshman set and
whether she would be ready."
But Michigan goes on to upset
the Rainbow Wahine 3-2, and Zim-
merman is awarded All-Tourna-
ment honors. The doubt vanishes
quickly.
"After the tournament they were
like, 'Gee, good decision. Nice job,
coach,' "Rosen says.
Four seasons later, Rosen can
appreciate how well that decision
turned out. Zimmerman has since
written herself indelibly into the
record books and into the annals
of Wolverine lore. A three-time
(soon to be fear-time) All-Ameri-
can. Michigan female athlete of the
year. Back-to-back triple doubles.
Program leader in single-season
assists (as a freshman). Program
leader in career assists (by a lot).
The list goes on and on.
For the past four years, it hasn't
been difficult to spot the best
player on Michigan's team. She
wears number 17, and whether she
is contorting in mid-air to set or
lunging in the backourt to dig, she
has become as much a fixture in
Cliff Keen Arena as the pep band,
the intermission challenges, and
"point... MICH-igan!"
g§§
For the first time since any-
one on the team can remember,
the Wolverines will begin spring
practice in 2011 without No. 17 at
the net. And junior outside hitter
Alex Hunt isn't quite sure what to
expect.
"It's definitely going to be a dif-
ferent experience playing without

her next year," Hunt says. "I don't
know Michigan volleyball without
Lexi."
With Zimmerman's departure,
rising junior Catherine Yager and
incoming freshman Lexi Danne-

P JED MOCH/Daily
miller - arriving in the fall - will
compete for the vacated position.
Fortunately for them, the team
understands that Zimmerman
is a unique talent, so they're not
expected to replicate her role in
the offense.
"I like the idea that they're very
different style setters from Lexi,"
Rosensays, "andthatwill eliminate
some of the comparisons. They're
goingto put their own stamp on the
way they run the team."
Accordingto Hunt, Zimmerman
is a rare "attackingsetter," onewho
is always a threat to hit, forcing the
opposing team to defend her. This
provides more opportunities for
the hitters, and Michigan's hitters
will be the first to say that they've
enjoyed the benefits of having Lexi
on their team.
"It's definitely an advantage for
me as an outside hitter because
Lexi holds the blocks and it opens
things up for me," Hunt says.
Although both Yager and
Dannemiller are traditional setters
who focus on distributing the ball,
Rosen isn't worried about losing
the strategic advantage of having
an attacking setter.
"They're less flashy, they're
less offensively minded," he says.
"They're more steady and rhyth-
mic. They tend to put their hitters
in really good positions, and that's
how they allow their hitters to be
successful."
Though she has never started,
Yager has seen action in a handful
of games during the past two sea-
sons. Her most significant contri-
bution came during spring practice
when Zimmerman was out with
an injured wrist. Rosen is particu-
larly excited about seeing Yager in
more extensive action, noting that,
while her style of play may not be
eyecatching, the results speak for
themselves.
"She's not flashy, she's not super
fast," he says, "but whether it's her
high school team or her club team
or even last spring, her teams just
always seem to win. And that's ulti-
mately what the goal is."
Yager acknowledges that she has
her own style, but that hasn't kept
her from getting tips from Zim-
merman in practice. The veteran
often gives her advice on how to
improve her technique. Yager says
she's grateful for the mentorship,
and she feels up to the challenge of
filling Zimmerman's shoes.
"It's a great opportunity for
me," she says. "The past two years
- especially the past year - I've
really watched her on the court and
off the court and how she's led the
team.
"Iwant to follow in her footsteps
and be something great like her."
The nextchapter inthe Zimmer-
man saga will begin when she com-
mences a winter training program
with the national teamin Anaheim,
Calif. She'll finish her degree in the
fall, she says, and then she'll likely
join a professional team in Europe
or Puerto Rico where she can travel
the world, explore different cul-
tures, sample exotic foods and play
the sport that she loves for "as long
as (her) body can hold up."
But nothing is set in stone.
Always striving for balance
in life and never one to sacrifice
academics for athletics, Zimmer-
man hopes also to go to graduate

school for architecture, another
passion she has cultivated while at
Michigan - she's a Program in the
Environment major with a concen-
tration in architecture.
And then there's the allure of
playing with the national team in

the Olympics. Zimmerman is quick
to minimalize her chances of going
down that path, but not for lack of
confidence or ability.
"I have the utmost respect for
(Olympians) and what they devote
their time to," she says. "But I'm
not sure it's what I want to devote
my time to because you have to
make alotof sacrificestoget alittle
bit better. I value balance more in
my life than I value putting every-
thing that I have into going to the
Olympics. I totally understand it
beingavaluablepathforother peo-
ple, but I don't think it's my path at
this point."
Rosen shares Zimmerman's
feelings, adding that the immense
amount of training compared with
a relatively small amount of actual
competition is anotherturnoff. The
national teamtrains year roundbut
participates in only one major com-
petition a year, not to mention that
the Olympic games occur just once
every four years.
"I think she's a person who has
a lot more interests than just vol-
leyball," he says. "It seems like the
training cycle of a four-year con-
tinuum, and the type of mentality
it takes to go into that type of set-
ting - I don't know how well it will
fit her. It will be good for her to go
there this winter and get a feel for
it."
Zimmerman will spend four
months training with national
team coaches and assistants along
with a handful of the most tal-
ented seniors in the country. With
an Olympic year looming in 2012,
it is unlikely that any of them will
remain on the team for this cycle.
But on the off chance that she does
eventually decide to pursue a spot
on the national team for2016, how-
ever, Zimmerman has a positive
outlook.
"I'm the type of person where,
wherever I am, I'm going to be
happy," she says.
9Ig 9
This is where the legend comes
to an end - the Michigan part of it,
anyway. Though Zimmerman's leg-
acy on the court and in the record
books will not soon be forgotten,
she says her greatest moment as a
Wolverine wasn't when she broke
any records or beat any teams or
won any awards. In fact, her great-
est Michigan moment didn't even
happen during the season.
"I think my greatest Michigan
moment was preseason this year
when I had a chance to be a captain
and lead the team and establish a
culture I've been trying to establish
since I've been in the program,"
Zimmerman says. "I wanted to
prioritize building team chemistry
and being good teammates."
It was also during the preseason
when the coaching staff picked out
their 2010 mantra.
"Commitment to the unknown."
Designed to inspire faith in the
young players, the phrase serves as
a poetic bookend to the Lexi Zim-
merman era. Her freshman and
senior seasons each began with
their own unknowns, but each
ended with clarity. Could she han-
dle the responsibility of directing a
college offense as a freshman? Yes.
Would a team full of inexperienced
players contend with some of the
best teams in the country and fin-
ish with one of the best overall
records of any Michigan team?Yes.
Once again, Zimmerman and
the young Wolverine team she

leaves behind will face a fresh set
of unknowns. But this time, there
is one thing that everybody knows
for sure.
No.17 will be sorely missed.

The Michigan men's soccer
team will try to recreate a similar
scenario in Friday night's match
against No. 3 seed Akron (20-1-2).
Earlier this season, the Wolver-
ines suffered an embarrassing 7-1
loss at the hands of the Zips. It was
Akron's largest margin of victory
this season.
Just as the American hockey

Michiganbeat undefeated Kan-
sas on Thursday night, 75-67, after
trailing by 13 points at the half. It
was the first time this season that
the Wol-
verines KANSAS 67
(5-4) MICHIGAN 75
have
come back to win after being
down at the half.
"Obviously, we are very excited
to beat agreat Big12 team," Michi-
gan coach Kevin Borseth said after
the game. "Kansas is very good,
we had to play hard and play well
to beat them and I thought we
did. That's a big win for us."
In a fast-paced matchup from
early on, the Jayhawks were first
to find their rhythm with a 10-0
run midway through the first
half. Kansas continued to control
the rest of the half, capitalizing
on high balls, screen shots and
lob passes. The Jayhawks outshot
Michigan 59.3 percent to 36.4
percent on the half.
Unable to defend against the
quick movement and height of
the Kansas players, Michigan
allowed 41 points, including a
last-second shot by the Jayhawks
at the buzzer to send the Wolver-
ines into the locker room.
But Michigan came back onto
the court in the second half as a
different team. According to Bors-
eth, there were three things that
the team wanted to accomplish
during the game: conversion,
offensive rebounds and foul shots.
And in the second half, the
Wolverines did each of these
things.
Michigan made more than
50 percent of its field goals and
3-pointers in the second half and
quickly built up a 9-0 run in the
opening minutes. Four Wolver-
ines scored in double figures,
including sophomore forward
Nya Jordan.
Jordan scored 11 points in the
game, but it was her 3-pointer
with less than eight minutes left
in the game that changed the

momentum. Her basket tied -the
score for the first time in the sec-
ond half, providing that extra
offensive spark that the Wolver-
ines needed.
"We can get on a roll whenever
we want to because we just have
that in our arsenal," senior guard
Veronica Hicks said. "When we
start heating up and knocking
down those shots, that's when we
really build our confidence. Bas-
ketball is a game-of momentum.
Once you see that first shot go
in, it's kind of like, 'Okay, I feel it
now.'"
But Michigan didn't take the
lead until there were just over
five minutes left in the game.
Junior guard Carmen Reynolds
hit a jumper to bring the score
to 58-57, and sophomore forward
Sam Arnold followed, sinking a
basket as the shot clock elapsed.
Arnold and junior guard
Courtney Boylan gave Michigan
a breath of fresh air from the
bench. Boylan - who has seen
minimal time on the court this
season - played for a total of 19
minutes and scored nine points.
She also snagged two of the Wol-
verines' 11 offensive rebounds. It
was the first time since Michi-
gan's home opener against Alcorn
State that the Wolverines have
won the offensive board battle.
"I thought Courtney came in
and handled the ball confidently
and got to the rim a couple of
times," Borseth said. "She hit a
layup or two right in the first half
there and hit a big three down
the stretch. I'm happy for her
because she hasn't played a whole
lot, but got in tonight and played
positively and aggressively."
Arnold also showed a strong
presence off the bench, coming
in as Michigan's second-leading
scorer and tallying 12 points. But
it was her final free throws that
ended the game.
With 1.2 seconds remaining in
regulation, Arnold drained both
of her shots receiving a standing
ovation in Crisler Arena and plac-
ing the first blemish on the unde-
feated Kansas's record.

calls the four-on-four drill the
"SOG game" in which the offense
attempts to get a shot on goal while
the defense attempts to prevent it
without fouling.
"It has helped these guys gain
that defensive discipline that really
is making a difference in how we
play as a team," Burns said.
The emphasis on defense has
paid dividends for the Wolverines
(17-4-3). They have not allowed
more than two goals in a game since
the loss to Akron.
The1980 U.S. hockeyteam placed
renewed emphasis on the defensive
end following the pre-Olympic loss
to the USSR. The Americans didn't
allow more than three goals in a
game throughout the Olympics.
Michigan's lockdown defense
hasn'tjustkeptthescorelow;it'swon
games. Since the 7-1 loss and sub-
sequent defensive adjustments, the
Wolverines have won nine straight.
Following the U.S. team's 10-3
drubbing, the Americans did not
lose a game during the 1980 Olym-
pics.

Freshman forward Soony Saad,
his brother - sophomore midfield-
er Hamoody Saad - and senior for-
ward Justin Meram have accounted
for much of the Wolverines' potent
attack. Meram currently has an
eight-game scoring streak with 16
goals this season.
Michigan will try to take down
one of the most dominant pro-
grams in college soccer. Akron has
the highest winning percentage in
NCAA Division-I soccer since 2005
and has made the NCAA Tourna-
ment nine of the lastt1o years, reach-
ing the College Cup three times.
After going undefeated last sea-
son before falling to Virginia on
penalty kicks in the national cham-
pionship, the Zips have cruised to
another dominant season. Led by
Jamaican-born freshman forward
Darren Mattocks, the nation's
third-leading scorer, Akron hopes
to get over the hump and bring
home the school's first team nation-
al championship.
"There is a little more pressure
on them," redshirt junior goal-

keeper Chris Blais said. "I think
our team isn't afraid of anyone,
and we're going to be ready to play
Akron on Friday night and we're
going to go out and win that game."
Just as the Americans had to take
care of business by beating Fin-
land in the final game of the medal
round, Michigan, too, realizes ithas
work left to do.
When talking about the team
reaching the College Cup, Burns
referenced a different moment in
sports history to motivate the team.
He explained how when Isiah
Thomas's Detroit Pistons team
finally beat the Boston Celtics in the
1988 Eastern finals, Kevin McHale
offered Thomas the following
words as they walked off the court:
"Congrats on getting there, but
that's notgood enough."
"The focus of our team has been
to get to the College Cup," Burns
said. "I congratulated the guys on
getting there, but I think every
one of these guys realizes that this
may be a once-in-a-career oppor-
tunity."

Breakdown: Michigan a big favorite outdoors -

w w w

By MARK BURNS
Daily Sports Editor
When Michigan and Michigan
State skated to a 3-3 tie in the Cold
War - the first-ever outdoor Division
I college hockey game, on Oct. 6, 2001
at Spartan Stadium - they set the
precedent for outdoor hockey games.
And on Saturday, the Wolverines
and Spartans will meet in the Big
Chill at the Big House, the world's
third-largest non-soccer stadium. The
game is projected to draw more than
110,000 to Michigan Stadium, crush-
ing the old record for attendance at
a hockey game. It was last set at the
2010 IIHF World Championship at
Veltins-Arena in Germany - the
recorded attendance was 75,976.
Fireworks are set to go off after
Michigan scores, and Guinness World
Records will be in attendance to put
the event in the history books. Clear-
ly, the stage is monumental in every
sense of the word.
OFFENSE
Following the end of last season,
there was some speculation that
Michigan coach Red Berenson might
lose upward of three juniors - Carl
Hagelin, Louie Caporusso and Matt
Rust - to entry-level contracts with
their respective NHL organizations.
But instead of foregoing their
senior season, the forwards decided
to return to Ann Arbor in hopes of
winning the program's first national
championship since 1998. So, it's no
surprise then that the three are the
Wolverines' leading scorers almost
midway through the season, helping

Michigan to an average of 3.22 goals
per game.
Even with a senior-laden roster,
the Wolverines have a slew of under-
classmen who have contributed on the
offensive end. Over the last few weeks,
the line of freshman Luke Moffatt and
sophomores A.J. Treais and Chris
Brown has tallied four goals and 11
assists. Berenson gave a vote of confi-
dence to the young crop of Wolverines
shortly after putting the trio together,
saying that they can match up against
any other line in the country.
And while Hagelin, Caporusso and
Rust all returned for their senior sea-
son, Spartan forward Corey Tropp
andAndrew Rowe didn't --bothopted
to sign with NHL teams and head to
their respective AHL affiliates. Tropp
and Rowe were Michigan State coach
Rick Comley's one-two punch on
offense last season, with Tropp lead-
ing the Spartans with 20 goals.
Michigan State sophomore Derek
Grant and junior Brett Perlini have
led the Spartans early on in scoring,
as Perlini sits in eighth place in total
points in CCHA play with 11 goals and
5 assists.
If the Big Chill turns into an offen-
sive shootout, expect the hometown
team to use speed to its advantage
against the Spartans.
EDGE: MICHIGAN

though their witty cheers and some-
times raunchy jeers at opposingteams
shouldn't play a role in the game's
outcome, as noise easily funnels out of
Michigan Stadium.
But at this week's Monday press
conference, Berenson did say the
wind, snow and weather conditions
will certainly factor into the Big
Chill's outcome. With the contest slat-
ed to begin at 3 p.m., the weather could
very well dip below freezing toward
the third period, maybe even sooner.
Over the course of the last week, there
has been more than 20 amateur and
college club games on the actual ice in
an effort to get the ice game-ready for
the heavyweight match up.
Fans should hope the extra games
haven't broken down the ice too
much, because if they have, expect
another situation like that during last
year's Camp Randall Classic, with
constant stoppages for ice repair and
snow removal.
This one's too close to call between
the Spartans and the Wolverines.

FINAL SCORE:

SPECIAL TEAMS
Ever since the beginning of the sea-
son, Michigan's power play has been
a work in progress. Whether it's not
getting enough shots on net or failing

'M', MSU set precedent for outdoor
hockey games in 2001 Cold War tie


By J. BRADY MCCOLLOUGH
Daily Sports Writer
EAST LANSING - The Michigan
hockey team was 47 seconds and one
clearing of the puck away from exiting
Spartan Stadium with an upsetvictory
over its arch-rival Michigan State, the
No.1 ranked team in the nation.
As the third period clock rolled
under one minute, the Wolverines held
a 3-2 advantage over the Spartans, who
pulled junior goalie Ryan Miller to set
up a 6-on-5 desperation attempt to tie
the game.
Down one man, Michigan failed to
clear the puck, thanks to the aware-
ness of Michigan State junior defense-
man Brad Fast, who held the puck in
the zone, and fired it at Michigan goal-
ie Josh Blackburn. A scramble for the
rebound ensued, and was finally con-
trolled by Spartan freshman forward
Jim Slater, who put the puck in the
only place it could have gone to score
his first collegiate goal, tying the game
at three apiece.
"I wanted to celebrate a little more,"
said Slater, who was corralled by senior
captain Adam Hall after putting the
puck past Blackburn.
"It was just a scramble," Hall said.
"I told Brad Fast that he looked like
(a pro) out there. I"ve never seen such
poise from a college hockey player in
my life. on the offensive blue line, the
way he kept his head up and saw the
entire play he kept the puck in numer-
ous times."
After the shock of having its appar-
ent victory stolen in the final minute,
Michigan was forced into a five-minute
sudden-death overtime to decide the
game. With the help of some tremen-
dous saves by Blackburn, the Wolver-
ines kept the game knotted at three,

and walked away with one point in the
CCHA standings, if nothing else.
"It"s never okay to tie against Michi-
gan State," Michigan junior forward
Mike Cammalleri said. "We put a good
effort forth and that"s what we"re
proud of We"re proud of the heart,
determination and character that we
showed."
"Nobody hung their head when they
scored the goal, and we knew we still
had a shot to win the game," Michigan
sophomore defenseman Andy Burnes
said. "We weren"t going to let them
win the game."
Twenty-two seconds into the first
period, Michigan junior Jed Ortmeyer
was called for tripping. One minute
later, Burnes was called for slashing,
setting up a two-man advantage for the
Spartans.
The Wolverines killed the three-on-
five, but were unable to hold Michigan
State scoreless. Shortly after the first
penalty expired, Hall skated free and
slid the puck past Blackburn for the
first goal of the game.
Michigan State"s second goal of
the game was very similar to its first.
After a charging penalty on Michigan
freshman forward Michael Woodford,
Burnes was called for his second slash-
ing penalty of the game both giving
the Spartans a two-man advantage
midway through the third period. This
time, Michigan State took advantage of
the three-on-five, as freshman defen-
seman Duncan Keith shot the puck
past Blackburn from the point, tying
the game at two.
"I thought they were questionable
calls," said Michigan coach Red Beren-
son in regard to the two slashing pen-
alties called on Burnes. "I was really
surprised that they were called. The
first one he didn"t even slash the guy he

just put his stick over his shoulder and
actually got the puck off him. It may
have been a slash from the ref's point
of view, but from where I was standing
theywere both questionable calls."
"It was about my first shift of the
game," Burnes said. "You -come out,
your emotions are flying, you"re so
intense, so into the game. The first one,
maybe I did, but you hate to see that
happen. It"s a bad feeling for yourself.
The second one wasn"t a penalty at all.
Especially when you"re already one
man down and he calls it."
Michigan can thank one line combi-
nation for its scoring Ortmeyer, Cam-
malleri, and freshman forward Jason
Ryznar.
Ryznar tied the game at one at the
end of the first period, after Cammal-
leri won the faceoff in the Michigan
State zone. Cammalleri tallied the final
two goals for Michigan both momen-
tarily giving the Wolverines the lead
at 2-1, and again at 3-2. He was a step
ahead of Miller the entire game.
With eight freshmen suiting up for
both teams, there were a lot of kinks
to be worked out before playing the
first game. Michigan State coach Ron
Mason felt that his team was in a dif-
ferent situation than Michigan in pre-
paring for this game.
"I think there was a lot more pres-
sure on us to win this game simply
because it was played in our own
barn," Mason said. "Our kids had to
live with it all week long maybe more
than Michigan did. We"ve kind of
changed our philosophy this year, so
we"re doing a lot of things differently
Michigan"s still playing the same style
they always did. They just reload and
away they go."

Michigan hockey coach Red Berenson tests out the ice at the Big House on Dec. 2.
It's more than a conference game. It's more than a regular Michi-
gan vs. Michigan State rivalry game. It's hockey outdoors - in
front of more than 100,000 people. The game will set a record
(one that will stand for a long time) for the most people ever to
watch a hockey game live. It's The Big Chill at the Big House and
after nearly six-months of hype, the game is finally here.

Nine years after The Cold War, rivals
set to clash outdoors in The Big Chill

what they're doing. They've broken
the ice, they've redone it ... this is good
ice. There might be some ice issues
depending on weather and usage and
everything, but you've got a lot of
people that know what they're doing
here."
Pat Seltsam is the brains behind the
"good ice" that will be on display when
the Wolverines take on their CCHA
rival Spartans on Saturday.
Part innovator, part engineer, Selt-
sam and his company are well known
when it comes to outdoor ice. With
Seltsam as the project manager, Ice
Rink Events creates about 40 rinks a
year.
"I feel like a little bit of an artist to
have to create something that fits into
the right place," Seltsam said. "Espe-
cially with (the Big Chill) rink, we
worked with them to create an Olym-
pic size rink instead of an NHL sized
rink, which when you look at how it fits
into that field, it works great."
Some of the best-known rinks on
Seltsam's resume include two World
Figure Skating Championship rinks,
two United States Figure Skating
Championship rinks, the first-ever
NHL Winter Classic in Buffalo, N.Y.,
Wisconsin's Camp Randall Classic
and Wisconsin's first outdoor game at
Lambeau Field.
Seltsam has been involved with
every step of the Big Chill construc-
tion since the University told him it
was interested in using the company
to put on its outdoor game at Michigan
Stadium.
The University got in touch with his
company last winter when Ice Rink
Events was in the middle of construct-
ing the Camp Randall Classic rink at
Wisconsin.

And while the Wolverines dropped
that outdoor game to the Badgers last
season, 3-2, there's no denying the
impact it had in propelling the higher-
ups at Michigan to push for a game at
the Big House.
"I was surprised at how early and
how proactive Michigan was about
reaching out to us," Seltsam said. "It
was last year when Michigan first
reached out to us and then we came
for a site visit again in the fall. ... (The
Big Chill construction) went really
smoothly, it was almost an identical to
what we did in Wisconsin, which went
extremely well."
Other than the unpredictable win-
ter weather in the Midwest - some-
thing the company tries to factor into
its construction schedule - everything
going into making the best ice possible
for the largest hockey game ever went
according to plan.
After using an outside company
to help level the football field, Selt-
sam's crew began setting up the cold
air chiller, located outside the tun-
nel, which connects to hoses down
at ice level. Coolant flows from the
chiller through the pipes, working like
"something that would propel the air
conditioning systems in a commercial
building in the summertime," Seltsam
said.
Once the cooling system was in
place, the boards and the glass were
cleared to go up. And after the frame
of the rink was set, the ice technicians
used good 'ol Ann Arbor city water to
make the actual ice.
"To actually make the ice, it's an old
fashioned man-with-a-hose," Seltsam
said. "Generally two days will get you
enough water on top of those refrig-
eration tubes to paint the ice. But after
that, you can add a little more water on
there to freeze it over the paint, so you

have enough ice you don't have any of
the vinyl logos stickingup."
So is that all that goes into making
Red Berenson-approved outdoor ice?,
Not quite.
One thing that both Seltsam and
Yost Ice Arena manager Craig Wotta
emphasized during the plans leading
up to the Big Chill ice construction was
the need to get players skating on the
ice early and often.
Once the ice is frozen, Wotta
emphasized the importance of build-
ing up multiple layers of ice through-
out the week to ensure that the ice is
rock-solid for Saturday. Wotta said
that early in the week the technicians
weren't using a blade on the zamboni
to scrape the ice and instead were just
filling in any cracks with water to cre-
ate a solid base.
"When we do shave (the ice), we can
form a new sheet of ice," Wotta said.
"Essentially, it makes the ice better.
But if we don't have the depth, if we
don't have it skated it up and if we don't
fill these cracks and crevices, it doesn't
help anything."
Games have been played on the ice
since Dec. 4 as all of the Ann Arbor
high schools, plus various prep pro-
grams, local colleges, and the Michi-
gan and Michigan State club teams
have had the chance to play, scrape
up and expose any glitches on the Big
Chill ice.
"Any time you skate on ice, it frac-
tures it a little bit more," Seltsam said.
"It compresses it a little bit more, so
when you rebuild it and resurface it
after a game, you end up with a more
solid piece of ice."
Seltsam added that while there
hadn't been any major glitches
exposed this time around, the pre-Big
Chill games did expose a small human
error in the construction.
"(Sunday), during the Adrian and
Concordia game, there (was) just

some little things that we didn't think
about," Wotta said." Normally, there's
a hole where the referees will talk to
the scorekeeper. We forgot to have that
cut, but now it's cut. But if that hap-
pens during the Big Chill, it's like 'Oh
my, what do we do?' From that stand-
point, having the games before has
been great."
While the rink itself may be a close
counterpart to the one on display at
Camp Randall Stadium last February,
there's no denying the spectacle that
the 113,000 in attendance will be a part
of at the Big House.
Members from Guinness World
Records will be present to document
the event as the largest hockey game
ever. And from a pre- and post-game
fireworks show to fireworks commem-
orating each Michigan goal scored,
Saturday will be as much a show as a
hockey game.
While Seltsam enjoys seeing the
blueprints manifestinto an actual rink,
the game will be Seltsam's favorite part
of the whole production.
"It's special when you can see a
skater's experience mesh with a fan's
experience," Seltsam said.
"The sense of creating something
for an event that people will enjoy is
one great thing. And when you see it
publicized like it is and when people
say great things about it...like when
Red Berenson goes out there and says
'Hey, this is great ice,' we love that."

As a captain of the No. 12 Michi-
gan hockey team, senior forward Carl
Hagelin thinks his expertise playing
outdoors could prove valuable when
the Wolverines
play host to Michi-M
gan State in The Michigan St
Big Chill at the Big at Michigan
House on Saturday. Matchup:

mates that the larg-
est crowd he ever played before at an
outdoor game in Sweden was made up
of 55 people. But his pond obviously
didn't seat 109,901 like Michigan Sta-
dium does.
"You feel like a kid again," Hage-
lin said Monday of stepping onto the
Big House ice for the first time. "You
love the game so much, and when you
come out of the tunnel, you love it
even more. Everyone is taken back to
when they were a young kid, skating
on the pond."
Although much of the Michigan
team (8-3-1-0 CCHA, 9-5-4 overall)
participated in the Camp Randall
Classic showdown against Wiscon-
sin in February, the Big Chill will be
unlike anything the sport has ever
witnessed. With more than 110,000
tickets sold, the rivalry game is
expected to shatter every hockey
attendance record.
"We get a chance to play in what is
the biggest game for my recent ten-
ure, and once again, it's a game that's
going to be magical," Michigan coach
Red Berenson said.
But the Big Chill is merely a
sequel to another in-state titan clash
between the Spartans and Wolver-
ines, which happened on Oct. 6, 2001
at Spartan Stadium: the Cold War.
And without the Cold War matchup,
hockey may never have come to the
gridiron of Michigan Stadium.
The Cold War was the first outdoor
college hockey game in history, and it
served as the precursor that set the
stage for hockey's return to the out-
doors.
The pioneering project began with
several Michigan State officials and
the idea to pit two teams against each
other in the confines of the Spar-

tans' 74,000-seat football stadium.
Although the proposal was disre-
garded for years, it finally gained an
advocate in Michigan State Athletic
Director Mark Hollis.
"We did a lot of homework, did alot
of research and started the process,"
Hollis said in a press conference on
Monday. "We actually announced it
before we knew if we could indeed
pull it off.
"When we did it, I kind of equate it
to the Apollo versus the space shuttle
- it's a heck of a lot easier now with
the technology they have in place."
Compared to today's more sophis-
ticated method of creating an outdoor
rink, Hollis' approach was archaic.
"When we executed the plan, it was
basically a refrigeration system from
Hollywood that chills the movie stu-
dios," Hollis said. "We sort of (made
a) makeshift ice rink out of that kind
of system."
Hollis didn't need to look far to
find the perfect opponent for the top-
ranked Spartans. Just 65 miles away,
No. 4 Michigan was ready for a battle
on the pond.
When the week of the game
arrived, temperatures boosted into
high 70s, leaving the game in jeopar-
dy. Rain and winds on Friday deterred
the Wolverines from even getting a
chance to practice on the ice before
gameday. But on Saturday morning,
temperatures took a nosedive, leav-
ing the ice in perfect condition for
the evening game under the lights at
Spartan Stadium.
As the seats filled with a world-
record crowd of 74,544, the teams
emerged from the tunnel and took the
ice. Then-Michigan goalie and cur-
rent goaltender coach Josh Blackburn
described stepping onto the field as
"almost a religious experience."
Then-junior forward Michael
Cammalleri wrote in an e-mail inter-
view with the Daily earlier this week
that the Cold War was like playing "on
a pond in front of the whole world."
Through the first 59 minutes of
the game, the Wolverines were pro-
pelled by Cammalleri, who convinced
Berenson to play him despite sustain-
ing a hip injury earlier. Cammalleri
was unstoppable in the Cold War,
racking up two goals and an assist to
put Michigan ahead, 3-2, late in the
third period.
But three periods weren't enough
to satisfy the record-setting crowd.
With less than half a minute
remaining and Spartan goaltender
Ryan Miller pulled for the extra
attacker, Cammalleri had the puck
stripped from him in the defensive

CLOCKWISE FRUM LEE I: The

for the puck at the "Cold War" in
2001. The outdoor game in Spar-
tan Stadium was the first of its
kind. The game ended in a 3-3 tie.

zone, and Spartan freshman Jim Slat-
er beat Blackburn glove-side to knot
the game.
In college hockey's introduction to
the limelight, it seemed appropriate
that the teams skated to a 3-3 draw,
leaving the conclusion of the Cold
War in limbo.
"It's only going to add to the rival-
ry," Miller said in a postgame inter-
view. "We're only going to want to get
at (Michigan) even more."
But it took nine years before the
Spartans and the Wolverines would
reunite outdoors.
According to Michigan associate
coach Mel Pearson, talks of bring-
ing the rivalry to Michigan Stadium
began immediately following the
Cold War game.
"I think that was one of the first
things we talked about in the week
after the game," Pearson said. "We
can't have Michigan State have that
(attendance) record."
Added Berenson: "We talked
whether that could happen here. ... It
wasn't for me to say we should have a
game here. It was for me to say that
I definitely would support it if it ever
comes to that, where the field condi-
tions or scheduling and everything
falls into place, then I would support
it 100 percent."
But due to the natural grass surface
at the Big House, a meeting in Ann

Arbor seemed unlikely. And when
Spartan Stadium's turf was replaced
with natural grass in 2002, hope of a
rematch severely dwindled.
Meanwhile, the impact of the Cold
War elsewhere was clearly visible.
Other hockey leagues, including the
NHL, began to host outdoor games on
a regular basis.
In November of 2003, the Edmon-
ton Oilers hosted the Montreal Cana-
dians in the Heritage Classic, which
stood as the league's first-ever regula-
tion outdoor game.
Over the next few years, outdoor
games ceased to be a rarity in the
United States. Ohio State and Wis-
consin battled in the Frozen Tundra
Holiday Classic at Lambeau Field in
2006, and the NHL began a tradition
of hosting a Winter Classic matchup
every New Year's Day in 2008.
In January, the Michigan Athletic
Department announced its finalized
plans to host the Big Chill at the Big
House - the long-awaited rematch
between the Wolverines and the
Spartans. Not surprisingly, the Big
House - the largest football stadium
in the nation - sold out quickly.
Berenson believes that "90 to 95
percent" of the packed house will be
Michigan supporters, suggesting that
Michigan State had to send back some
of its allotted tickets because of the
high demand in Ann Arbor. And this

time, the clash isn't between two of
the nation's top-ranked teams.
Regardless, the Wolverines will
certainly have their hands full on Sat-
urday.
"It's going to be a great game,"
Michigan State coach Rick Comley
said on Monday. "You always throw
the records out when you play Michi-
gan in any sport."
Comley added that he isn't try-
ing to block out the immensity of the
game, but rather "let (his players)
enjoy it.... It's going to dominate their
thoughts."
He joked about busing the Spartans
(3-7-1, 6-8-3) to apublic skate session at
the Big House just to ensure that the
only cold feet they get is because of the
bitter cold forecasted on Saturday.
"It would be nice to get (the play-
ers) into the building and let them
look around and stargaze for awhile,"
Comley said.
Ultimately, the game does factor
into the CCHA standings as a regu-
lar-season, three-point matchup, but
everyone involved knows it's much
more than that - it's putting college
hockey on center stage.
"This game is with our arch-rival
Michigan State," senior goaltender
Shawn Hunwick said on Monday.
"We're going to break records. I don't
think anyone has ever played a game
of this magnitude, inside or outside."
