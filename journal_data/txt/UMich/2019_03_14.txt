A large banner was hung on 
the east side of a smokestack 
in the University of Michigan’s 
Central Power Plant Wednesday 
morning, 
reading 
“Climate 
strike walkout 3/15” was hung 
on the east side of a smokestack 
in the University of Michigan’s 
Central Power Plant. It is 
currently 
unknown 
which 
group is responsible for making 
and displaying the sign. The 
act was not sponsored by the 
Washtenaw 
County 
Climate 
Strike. 
The banner is now one 
of the many signs around 
campus 
in 
support 
of 
the 
Washtenaw 
County 
Climate 

Strike. On Friday, hundreds of 
environmental activists will be 
meeting on the Diag to join the 
Washtenaw 
County 
Climate 
Strike to make a statement on the 
pressing issue of climate change. 
Students are being urged to 
walk out of class at 11:11am for 
the 12:00pm event as a reference 
to the Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change’s statement 
that was made last October. It 
warns there are 12 years left to 
successfully mitigate the worst 
effects of climate change. For 
those who are not able to leave 
class, they are asked to wear 
green to show their support. 

According to the College 
of 
Engineering, 
many 
Engineering students do not 
exceed the standard limit of 
printing pages allocated to 
each student in the school 
per term. As a result, the 
College of Engineering will be 
eliminating their supplemental 
allocation for students after 
the 2019-2020 school year.
Dan 
Maletta, 
executive 
director 
of 
information 
technology for the College of 
Engineering, 
explained 
the 
reasoning behind the phasing-
out of this accommodation.

“We have generally seen a 
decline in (printing) demand,” 
Maletta wrote in an email. “We 
consistently see that almost 
two thirds of our students 
never exceed the ITS printing 
allocations, and as a result we 
are phasing out engineering’s 
supplemental allocation.”
Tanner 
Robison, 
an 
Engineering PhD candidate, 
explained that he often has 
large homework assignments 
and labs to print out, but doesn’t 
see the need for Engineering 
students to receive greater 
printing allocations compared 
to students in other colleges.
“I don’t get the feeling 
that 
Engineering 
students 

necessarily 
print 
more,” 
Robinson said. “I mean, I have 
to print off my homework and 
stuff periodically and some of 
them are pretty extensive. But 
that doesn’t mean that people 
who are not in the engineering 
program don’t have to print off 
similar things.”
According to the College 
of 
Engineering, 
many 
Engineering 
students 
do 
not utilize the supplemental 
allocation they are given each 
term. In fact, the Michigan 
CAEN 
(Computer-Aided 
Engineering 
Network) 
website states that over half 
of students in Engineering 
don’t exceed the standard 

printing allocation available 
to all students. As a result, the 
College of Engineering will be 
eliminating their supplemental 
allocation for students after 
the 2019-2020 school year, an 
announcement they made on 
September 8, 2017. In 2016, 
Engineering students received 
an additional $40 for printing, 
but it was decreased by $10 
the next school year. This 
four-year process of cutting 
down the allocation is helping 
to phase out the allocation 
altogether.

U.S. Reps. Debbie Dingell, 
D-Mich., 
and 
Fred 
Upton, 
R-Mich., have written a letter 
to Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement 
asking 
to 
halt 
the scheduled deportation of 
journalist Emilio Gutiérrez Soto, 
a Knight-Wallace Fellow at the 
University of Michigan.
Gutiérrez 
joined 
2018-19 
Knight Wallace Fellowship class, 
studying safety and freedom of 
journalists. The fellowship is an 
eight-month program designed 
for mid-career journalists to help 
advance their skills and address 
challenges in the industry.
Gutiérrez 
was 
denied 
asylum Feb. 28 and scheduled 
to be deported back to Mexico. 
Gutiérrez and his son Oscar 
sought asylum in the United 
States in 2008 after receiving 
death threats for his reporting 
for news outlet El Diario Del 
Noroeste on crimes committed 
by the Mexican military in 
Chihuahua, Mexico.

On Wednesday night, the Carcer-
al State Project hosted a roundtable 
discussion in Hatcher Graduate Li-
brary to discuss how incarceration 
affects various communities and 
how to repair the resulting damage. 
Established in 2016 by Professor 
Heather Ann Thompson and the 
Department of Afroamerican and 
African Studies, the Carceral State 
Project brings together members of 
the community to research and dis-
cuss mass incarceration in the Unit-
ed States. The event drew about 100 
attendees and is the fifth event in 
their symposium series.
Ashley Lucas, member of the 

CSP Steering Committee and asso-
ciate professor of Theatre & Drama 
at the Residential College, hosted 
the event. She explained why she 
believes the work of her organiza-
tion, and that of the featured panel-
ists, is so important in today’s politi-
cal climate.
“We are living in a moment of 
extraordinary crisis,” Lucas said. 
“With the highest incarceration 
rates in the world’s history, this is a 
time that I believe we will look back 
on with the sorrow and shame with 
which we now view slavery.”
The first question presented to 
the panel was about their personal 
experiences with the carceral state 
and how those experiences affected 
their lives.
Natalie Holbrook, program di-

rector of the Michigan Criminal 
Justice Program, was the first pan-
elist to talk. She explained how the 
carceral state affects everyone — 
both people who have relationships 
with inmates and those who have 
no direct connection to the criminal 
justice system.
Holbrook specifically discussed 
the connection a prison can have 
with the place it is located. 
“I think that we don’t realize 
how much prisons become parts of 
whole communities where every-
body knows somebody who works 
at the prison,” Holbrook said. “It 
goes unrecognized, but it is totally 
part of the landscape.” 
Kathie Gourlay, whose son has 
previously been incarcerated, ex-
plained the effect his incarceration 
had on her and her family. Gourlay 
also discussed her belief families 
should be taken into account by 
the justice system. While her son 
was being tried, her family wrote 
letters to explain how his absence 
could affect them, but the judge 
said they couldn’t be considered 
in the case.
Gourlay also explained the 
challenges of communicating with 
her son while he was in prison be-
cause of the barriers the carceral 
state had imposed.
“Once you’re in prison they 
don’t care about the family,” she 
said. “The only time they’ll tell you 
anything is if your family member 
is almost dead.”
Melnee McPherson, who re-
ceived a PhD in sociology from 
the University, spoke about her 
experience taking care of her 
brother’s children while he was 
incarcerated and the struggles she 
encountered.
“Every three or four weeks 
the social workers flipped over,” 
McPherson said. “The system is 
really screwed up. The system that 
is supposed to be helping young 
people especially — it doesn’t 
work.”
The last panelist to speak was 
Aaron Suganuma, who served 
four and a half years in prison and 

now works as a substance abuse 
counselor and the executive direc-
tor of A Brighter Way, a non-profit 
organization that provides assis-
tance to individuals transition back 
into society.
Suganuma explained the obsta-
cles he faced as a felon, especially 
when trying to secure housing. Su-
ganuma said McKinley, one of the 
largest landlords in the area, will 
not rent to felons, and other land-
lords use McKinley’s standards.
Suganuma also discussed how 
his previous incarceration affected 
his choices when applying to col-
leges. 
“I ended up not going to school 
here and not going to school at 
Wayne 
State 
University, 
even 
though I was accepted, because of 
the admissions process,” Saginuma 
said. “I felt like I was discriminated 
against, I felt like I was unwelcome.”
When asked about the effect in-
carceration had on familial relation-
ships, both Suganuma and McPher-
son felt they could persist through 
incarceration. 
Suganuma 
used 
the example of his mother, while 
McPherson discussed her brother 
and his kids.
“My mom was engaged in my 
life, at least, she tried to be,” Sug-
anuma said. “The funny thing is, at 
least because of the carceral state, 
she always knew where to find me.” 
McPherson explained her broth-
er was mentally ill and a substance 
abuser, but this didn’t keep his chil-
dren from seeing him.
“Even though he was mentally 
ill and a substance abuser, they still 
loved their father,” she said. “Chil-
dren love their parents.”
Gourlay believed prisons were 
a huge detriment to the formation 
of community, something she per-
sonally experienced while her son 
was incarcerated. She explained the 
carceral state prevented formation 
of communities between prisoners, 
as well as with those on the outside.

Q: What did you do over 
spring break? Any memorable 
moments?

“I spent spring break in the 
San Diego area working 
with GRID Alternatives, 
a non-profit, and twelve 
UMich students installing 
solar panels on two modular 
homes on the Los Coyotes 
Band of Cahuilla and Cupeña 
Indian reservation...There 
was one member of the tribe 
who stopped by to visit us 
most of our nights staying 
on the reservation to talk to 
us and spend time with us. 
He opened up a lot about 
his life and experiences 
and started dialogue about 
very serious problems and 
injustices in the U.S. The trip 
really forced so many of us to 
talk about identities and our 
experiences.”

n 1982, Chinese citizens 
who had been forced to 
move to the countryside 

under 
Chairman 
Mao 

Zedong’s Cultural Revolution 
fled back to China’s urban 
centers. However, as this 
mass 
exodus 
occurred, 

one young Chinese official 
requested 
a 
position 
in 

Zhengding, Hebei Province, 
far away from the rapidly 
growing urban power centers: 
Xi Jinping. This seemingly 
strange request from the low-
level government worker was 
the first notable move by Xi, 
who built his career through 
shrewd, power-consolidating 
moves. Thirty years later, Xi 
has become China’s president 
and 
general 
secretary 
of 

the Communist Party, and 
appears 
to 
have 
grand 

ambitions for China on both 
domestic and international 
fronts. However, as China 
becomes a dominant player in 
world affairs, Xi’s oppressive 
government 
promotes 
a 

vision 
that 
disregards 

basic liberties, rights and 
international 
principles, 

making its ambitions a threat 
to its own citizens.

The 
most 
prominent 

example of China’s disregard 
for human rights is the Xi 
government’s 
abhorrent 

treatment of the Uyghurs, a 
primarily-Muslim 
minority 

ethnic group who live in 
the far western province of 
Xinjiang. In Xinjiang, the 
Chinese 
government 
has 

established 
a 
surveillance 

system 
rivaling 
the 
one 

George 
Orwell 
describes 

in 
his 
novel 
“1984”. 
In 

order to keep tabs on the 
Uyghurs, thousands of video 
cameras are in place along 
streets 
in 
Xinjiang, 
and 

policemen are stationed in 
front of nearly every major 
building. China has recently 
even 
begun 
administering 

“physical exams” in order 
to non-consensually gather 
identification 
information 

from Uyghur citizens, such 
as DNA samples, fingerprint 
scans and retinal scans.

However, surveillance is 

only the tip of the iceberg in 
Xinjiang. Under Xi, China 
has also introduced a policy 
called “de-extremification,” 
which 
includes 

“re-education” 
camps, 
to 

which over a million Uyghurs 
have been sent. The camps 
are designed to indoctrinate 
Uyghurs through promoting 
Chinese 
values 
and 

destroying Uyghur culture. 
Treatment 
in 
the 
camps 

ranges from things such as 
forcing Uyghurs to drink beer 
and eat pork (both of which 
are forbidden in Islam) to 
more extreme human rights 
violations, including torture, 
the 
banning 
of 
certain 

Muslim names and extreme 
political 
indoctrination. 

Politically, China has also 
worked 
to 
limit 
Uyghur 

rights through the passage 
of religious regulations and 
counterterrorism laws.

China’s 
dedication 
to 

denying 
its 
own 
citizens 

human 
rights 
is 
perhaps 

matched 
only 
by 
its 

dedication to denying it has 
ever done anything wrong. 
In response to the Uyghur 
controversy, China initially 
denied 
the 
re-education 

camps even existed. Once 
that was proved verifiably 
false, the government shifted 
its position, saying the camps 
were necessary for fighting 
religious 
extremism, 
and 

likened them to boarding 
schools 
(ironically, 
it’s 

already illegal for Uyghurs 
in Xinjiang to not send their 
children 
to 
government-

run schools). The Chinese 
government 
has 
also 

deliberately 
spread 
false 

information about life in the 
camps in order to make it 
more difficult to accurately 
understand conditions there, 
and at one point dismissed 
criticism of the camps as the 
West baselessly criticizing 
China’s human rights record.

Though this may seem 

awful, it is hardly outside 
of the norm for China, a 
country that has consistently 
opposed human rights. In 
addition to cracking down 
on 
dissenting 
journalists, 

lawyers and activists within 
China, Xi has also worked 
tirelessly 
to 
weaken 
the 

United 
Nations’ 
ability 

to investigate and punish 
nations for human rights 
violations. In 2017, Human 
Rights Watch exposed the 
Xi government’s attempts to 
prevent critical actors from 
contributing to reviews of 
China’s human rights record. 
In 2018, China introduced a 
U.N. bill aimed at limiting 
human 
rights 
oversight, 

which suggested replacing 
punishments and sanctions 
with “dialogue.”

In addition to violating 

human rights, Xi has also 
worked to strengthen his 
personal power as president 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
both 

electoral 
fairness 
and 

previously established rules 
and norms. After the death of 
Mao Zedong, China shifted 
away from focusing on the 
power of individual leaders, 
implementing 
term 
limits 

which shifted the focus to 
party power, a development 
many cite as a factor in 
China’s subsequent economic 
growth. Xi, however, has 
reverted strongly away from 
this policy. In 2017, the 
Communist Party added “Xi 
Jinping Thought” to their 
Constitution, putting him on 
the same level as Mao Zedong. 
In 2018, Xi’s Communist 
Party, which controls most 
of the National Assembly, 
voted 2,958 in favor (three 
abstained and two opposed) 
to 
remove 
presidential 

term limits, allowing him 
to 
serve 
indefinitely. 
Xi 

has 
also 
engaged 
in 
an 

anti-corruption 
campaign, 

which 
has 
largely 
been 

used to ensure important 
party 
positions 
are 
held 

by loyalists. Outwardly, Xi 
also preaches party loyalty 
above all else to citizens and 
had his government issue a 
directive that all Chinese 
citizens 
studying 
abroad 

“always follow the Party.”

While these developments 

may 
seem 
disheartening, 

they reflect a fundamental 
difference in governmental 
and 
geopolitical 
attitudes 

between China and the West, 
something which the West 
has consistently failed to 
fully comprehend. Unlike the 
prevailing Western ideology, 
which prioritizes individual 
liberties and freedoms as the 
essential building blocks of 
society, China believes that 
strengthening the state is 
the highest priority. This 
cultural 
difference 
helps 

explain why the Chinese 
government takes such a 
dim view of human rights — 
the rights of the individual 
are not of crucial concern, 
and they can interfere with 
the processes that help the 
state. For Xi, consolidating 
power is primarily about 
attempting 
to 
run 
the 

country 
as 
efficiently 
as 

possible, something which 
democratic norms interfere 
with. 
Sadly, 
this 
state-

strengthening approach is 
incredibly destructive to the 
rights of Chinese citizens, 
especially ethnic minorities 
like the Uyghurs and those 
who 
disagree 
with 
Xi’s 

policies.

Ultimately, while China’s 

economic and political rise 
has been astonishing, the 
United 
States 
and 
other 

nations 
should 
be 
wary 

about China’s policies. Xi 
is a politically savvy leader 
with lofty goals, but those 
goals must be accomplished 
without sacrificing human 
rights 
or 
disregarding 

international law.

KIANNA MARQUEZ | COLUMN

I

’ve 
been 
thinking 
a 

lot lately about what I 
want to be doing when 

I leave college for the real 
world. As a freshman, I’m 
going to have to decide soon 
which undergraduate degree 
to pursue so I can have an 
idea of the classes I will 
need to take in the upcoming 
semesters. Just the other 
day, things started to click. 
I 
finally 
conceptualized 

what 
my 
ultimate 
career 

goals are, but at the cost of 
informing myself about a 
phenomenon that is on its 
way to tear our communities 
apart: 
environmental 

gentrification, which is when 
policies that are intended to 
service the climate drive up 
property costs.

Today, 
the 
lawmakers 

of 
many 
metropolitan 

areas 
are 
seeking 
to 

improve 
the 
quality 
of 

life by urbanizing sectors 
that 
are 
underdeveloped. 

For 
instance, 
Detroit’s 

Planning and Development 
Department 
has 
created 

several 
initiatives 
to 

improve 
infrastructure, 

economic opportunity and 
neighborhood 
relations 

over recent years. Federal 
and 
local 
lawmakers 

have 
also 
demonstrated 

their 
awareness 
for 
the 

need 
to 
execute 
green 

urban development in the 
process, 
making 
strides 

toward 
the 
construction 

of 
more 
greenways 
and 

conservancies 
within 
the 

heart of the downtown area.

Despite these strides, I 

fear that Detroit politicians 
are 
conducting 
urban 

development 
in 
a 
way 

that 
prioritizes 
profit 

for corporations over the 
needs of the populations 
who live near these new 
projects. 
Whether 
these 

projects feature impressive 
man-made 
infrastructure 

or 
large-scale 
natural 

attractions, the possibility 
of creating an attraction 
just to draw people into the 
metropolitan area seems to 
promote gentrification. If so, 
the actions of our authorities 
would contribute more to 
the capitalistic side of the 
economy rather than the 
health of the environment 

or 
the 
wellbeing 
of 
the 

people living in that area. 
As a result, I fear that 
perpetual 
gentrification, 

whether 
it 
occurs 
due 

to 
the 
development 
of 

commercial areas or natural 
preservations, 
will 
create 

further economic and social 
turmoil for Detroit.

In New York City, the 

High Line, a former railroad 
line, was renovated to serve 
as 
greenway 
on 
which 

pedestrians can walk for 
miles throughout the city. 
Having completed its final 
renovations 
in 
2014, 
the 

High 
Line 
has 
attracted 

nearly five million residents 
and tourists for its walkway, 
artistic 
commissions 
and 

events. 
As 
a 
result, 
the 

greenway has undoubtedly 
caused 
an 
increase 
in 

economic 
activity, 
profits 

for businesses that surround 
it and thus in the price 
of 
the 
surrounding 
real 

estate. 
Unfortunately, 

this has caused those on 
the disadvantaged side of 
gentrification 
to 
feel 
its 

effects: Many have had to 
leave their home in nearby 
neighborhoods 
or 
been 

forced to give up their small 
businesses due to the growth 
of commercial demand.

In an effort to create 

a piece of infrastructure 
that would make the city 
appear greener both visually 
and 
characteristically, 

authorities 
in 
New 
York 

utilized 
wealthy 
and 

resourceful 
benefactors 

to create a monument to 
receive 
more 
money 
and 

unintentionally 
transform 

the socioeconomic character 
of the area. Greenways like 
the High Line that defeat 
the 
purpose 
of 
greener 

metropolitan areas are being 
constructed 
in 
numerous 

locations 
worldwide. 
I 

fear that ours in Detroit, 
the 
Dequindre 
Cut, 
will 

have a similar fate. These 
gestures 
to 
renovate 

current 
infrastructure 

into 
green 
infrastructure 

mean 
well, 
but 
to 
what 

extent should we demand 
that 
they 
also 
help 
the 

surrounding 
environment 

and populations?

For 
one, 
I 
think 
it’s 

absolutely possible for us to 
demand better from project 
developers, lawmakers and 
monetary 
contributors 
to 

create more mindful urban 
developments 
than 
the 

greenways. These projects 
can prioritize success for 
a 
sector 
of 
society 
that 

needs it more. In essence, 
authorities with control of 
metropolitan areas should 
adopt a progressive method 
deemed 
as 
“conscious 

anti-gentrification” 
when 
pursuing 
green 

urban 
development. 
This 

process would consist of 
renovating 
technology 

and 
infrastructure 

incrementally, allowing the 
public to maintain a lifestyle 
they’re 
comfortable 
with 

while making small changes 
to mitigate the consequences 
of peoples’ typical impact on 
the environment. As a result, 
our neighborhoods should 
benefit from improvements 
made to the quality of the 
environment as well as to 
the well-being of the general 
public 
without 
making 

drastic changes to its own 
socioeconomic character.

In 
hearing 
about 
the 

downfalls of green urban 
development, I felt within 
myself a burning passion to 
prevent this type of economic 
flourishing that occurs at the 
degradation of the lives of 
people in my community and 
that occurs with ignorance 
towards 
our 
environment. 

In essence, I found meaning 
in a type of career directed 
towards the development of 
disadvantaged communities 
by 
way 
of 
incremental 

change. Therefore, I believe 
authorities 
should 
fulfill 

their 
intentions 
of 
urban 

growth by designing methods 
of change that specifically 
address the needs and utilize 
the advantages of that area 
rather 
than 
diminishing 

it by some overwhelming 
economic feat. In doing so, 
I foresee these authorities 
achieving a society balanced 
by the rise of all of the people 
it encompasses.

Since her first days of high school, 
senior softball catcher Katie 
Alexander has been willing to do 
whatever it takes to get on the 
softball field.
Formerly a second baseman, Al-
exander only had one response 
when her high school coach 
Alicia Seegert asked on the 
first day of practice if she’d ever 
considered catching:
“Well, could I try out for 
varsity?”
She’d been playing softball since 
the first grade and was ready for 
some real competition. Not only did 
Alexander try out for — and make 
— Saline High School’s varsity 
team as a freshman catcher, she 
was subsequently voted team 
captain three years in a row. 
Although she had the confi-
dence of her teammates, as 
an underclassman, Alex-
ander struggled to adjust 
to her new position and 
level of play. This was 
particularly true on of-
fense where she either 
hit it hard or struck out, 
nothing in between — a 
pattern that Seeger 
said stemmed from a 
lack of patience. 
But with a work ethic 
like Alexander’s, the 
struggles wouldn’t last 
long. 
Much like she has in her 
four years at Michigan, 
in high school, Alexander 
only got better. As time went 
on, she gained confidence 
and consistency — a combi-
nation that, by her senior year, 
made her ready to walk onto a 
top-ranked team like Michigan. 
Throughout her high school 
career, she was chosen as the 
team’s MVP and was twice named 
a Michigan All-State player. 
Despite not being recruited, Alex-
ander was eager to stay in the game 
after high school. 
Growing up ten minutes from Ann 
Arbor, it had always been a dream 
of Alexander’s to play for the 
Wolverines, a dream Seegert — a 
Michigan graduate herself — 
fully supported. 
Coming to Ann Arbor would 
challenge Alexander both on 
the field and in the class-
room, something Seegert 
knew from personal expe-
rience. 
Seegert served as the Wol-
verines’ starting catcher 
from 1984 to 1988, holding 
ten team records — includ-
ing for home runs and 
batting average — by 
the time she gradu-
ated. Remembered 
as one of the 
best catchers in 
Michigan’s his-
tory, Seegert 
was the first 
Wolverine 
softball 
player 
named an 

All-American in 1986. 
Throughout high school, Seegert 
held the current senior catcher to a 
high standard, knowing what would 
be asked of her if she was going to 
play at the collegiate level, especially 
for a program like Michigan. 
When Alexander walked onto the 
team her freshman year at Michi-
gan, she went from being coached 
by one Michigan softball legend to 
another. Carol Hutchins —Michi-
gan’s longstanding head coach —had 
coached Seegert over 30 years 
earlier. While the two coaches share 
a similar style, nothing could have 
prepared Alexander for the coach 
she was about to have. 
“Hutch is incomparable to anybody 
else,” Alexander said. 
Though it’s hard to imagine not 
seeing her behind the plate now, Al-
exander didn’t begin her collegiate 
career as a starter. Lagging behind 
other catchers in the lineup and 
failing to fill the shoes of an impres-
sive senior class including catcher 
Lauren Sweet, she appeared in just 
13 games with a batting average of 
.273 in 2016. 
Alexander never resented her 
position as a walk-on, seeing it as an 
opportunity for growth. 
“I could only go up from there,” 
Alexander said. “My dad always told 
me to work hard and that you’d rath-
er be the underdog. Thinking that 
way always helped me strive to be 
greater. My dad’s always reminded 
me that I can do anything.” 
During her sophomore year, she 
earned more time behind the plate, 
maintaining a near perfect fielding 
percentage of .997 and committing 
fewer errors than in her freshman 
season. 
Even when she wasn’t playing, she 
watched and learned, getting ready 
to seize her opportunity when the 
time came. 
And then, it finally did. 
Alexander rocketed into her junior 
year with the hard work and deter-
mination she had showed Seegert all 
those years ago. 
“(Alexander) has improved beyond 
measure,” Hutchins said. “She’s got a 
heart to beat. She wants to be great. 
She wants to be her best. This is a 
kid who’s come to me as much as 
anybody in my time — ‘Can we hit 
early? Can we do this?’ She’s open. 
She wants to improve. We like to see 
kids on that kind of a trajectory.
“It’s the same with offense; her of-
fense has come a long way and that’s 
just hard work. In our sport, it’s just 
a lot of swings, a lot of throws, a lot 
of detail.”
Alexander’s momentum only took 
off from there. Her performance at 
the plate began to catch up to her 
defense. Within the first 10 games 
of her junior season, Alexander ran 
off with the starting position, at the 
time held by then-junior catcher 
Alex Sobczak. She ended last season 
with a batting average of .314, with 
29 runs scored and five home runs 
— a force to be reckoned with. 
Her energy on the field prompted 
Hutchins to start Alexander in 54 of 
57 games last season and ultimately 
earned her a place as the catcher on 
the All-Big Ten Second Team. After 
that season, Alexander was given an 
athletic scholarship. 
“She was as good a catcher as there 
was in the league, in my opinion,” 
Hutchins said of Alexander’s per-
formance last season. “She handles 
the pitchers fantastic, her receiving 
skills — she was throwing everybody 
out — and she was just having fun 
with it.”
Despite her personal success, 
Alexander’s favorite moments have 
always been with her teammates, 
whether off the field — counting 
cacti in Arizona or go-karting in 
Kentucky — or on it, watching the 
team succeed. 
“When I see people who hav-
en’t played a lot — someone 
who wasn’t highly recruit-
ed or wasn’t meant to 
be playing a lot — do 
something great like 
get a good hit in 
a big situation, 
those are my 

favorite moments,” Alexander said, 
“
Just to see my teammates succeed 
after putting in all this work for the 
past six months or years on end.” 
While her teammates now describe 
her as positive and supportive, some 
were at first a little intimidated by 
her presence. 
At the imposing height of 5-foot-
10, it’s easy to see how Alexander 
could prompt intimidation. But it’s 
much more than her tall stature that 
has commanded the respect of her 
teammates.
“On the field, she’s a beast,” 
Hutchins said earlier this season. 
“I’ve been really pleased. Katie’s a 
kid who’s done nothing but get bet-
ter every year. She’s one of the nicest 
people you’ll ever meet; she’s a great 
teammate. Her teammates love her. 
She’s a nice kid, but on the field, she 
wants to beat you. That’s the kind of 
kid I want on the field.” 
Alexander has seen it as part of her 
role as team captain to keep the 
game fun again this season, despite 
early losses. The Wolverines suf-
fered several tough defeats against 
teams like then No. 9 Louisiana State 
and North Carolina, leading to their 
current record of 12-10. For the first 
time in almost 20 years, Michigan 
spent two weeks unranked, though 
recent wins have propelled the team 
to the No. 25 spot. 
As her senior year continues and 
her time with the Wolverines comes 
to a close, Alexander’s own legacy 
will start to take shape. A tenant of 
Hutchins’ program is to leave the 
team better than you found it — a 
challenge Alexander has not shied 
away from. 
“She takes (the mantra) to heart, 
which is the first step,” Hutchins 
said. “It’s not something that’s total-
ly measurable, but they understand 
that if we can get this team to be all 
in. That’s what I want the seniors to 
lead this team to, a team that is all 
about the team on every pitch.”
Whether the team has been “all in” 
up to this point in the season is up 
for debate. With erratic performanc-
es practically every weekend, Mich-
igan is still looking for consistency 
from its players.
Alexander is no exception.
Though Alexander boasts an im-
pressive 11 RBI thus far, her batting 
average of .152 — the lowest of the 
starting players — leaves much to 
be desired. On defense, Alexander 
has maintained her confidence, 
throwing batters out and saving the 
Wolverines runs in practically every 
game. 
As Michigan faced the ups and 
downs of the first few games, 
Alexander tried to lead by example, 
coming in each day as if she was still 
the freshman who hadn’t earned her 
spot. That mentality has helped her 
push through the challenges and 
avoid getting in her own head. 
“Always focus on what you can do at 
the time,” Alexander said. “Even if 
you make an error or mess up, focus 
on what you can do on that next 
pitch. Focus on what you do well 
opposed to what you can’t do at the 
time because it’s so quick paced. It 
doesn’t matter what you did before.”
Alexander’s natural confidence and 
inclination to lead carry over into 
everything she does. Always one to 
take charge in group projects or vol-
unteer in class, she’s never hesitant 
to use her voice. She’s developed 
that voice both on and off of the 
field, simultaneously growing as a 
player and a person. 
By virtue of her position as catcher, 
Alexander has been leading the 
team from behind the batter’s box 
long before being officially voted a 
captain this year. As leader of the de-
fense, Alexander’s prowess behind 
the plate has garnered confidence 
from many her teammates. 
“She definitely shows passion,” said 
sophomore shortstop Natalia Rodri-
guez. “You can see that right away 
on the field. You can see how seri-
ously she takes the game. She wants 
to build the people around her. As a 
catcher, she takes that captain role, 
which is one of the most vocal.”

Question: 

What goes

Answer:

When the No. 25 Michigan softball 
team takes the field at home for the 
first time in 2019 this weekend, it 
will look to put early-season incon-
sistencies in the rearview mirror.
After securing the Big Ten regu-
lar-season title a season ago — the 
program’s 10th in the last 11 years 
— the Wolverines enter their first 
homestand with a record hovering 
around .500. After spending two 
weeks outside the NFCA Poll for 
the first time in 18 years, Michigan 
will look for contributions from its 
entire roster at Alumni Field.
The Daily breaks down each of the 
Wolverines’ position groups as they 
aim to capitalize on a Kent State 
team that enters Ann Arbor mired 
in an eight-game losing streak.
Pitchers:
This year’s pitching staff is 
headlined by sophomore Meghan 
Beaubien, who posted a 33-6 
record, 1.16 ERA and 266 strikeouts 
across 217 innings pitched en route 
to first team All-American honors 
in 2018. The southpaw’s success 
in the circle has been highlighted 
by the four no-hitters to her name, 
one of which came less than three 
weeks ago against California State 
Northridge. After suffering a bro-
ken wrist in the weight room last 
fall, Beaubien’s ERA has ballooned 
to 2.44. She’s been dominant as a 
starter, but Beaubien has allowed 
upwards of four runs in multiple 
relief appearances in 2019.
Another arm that’s been impres-
sive is freshman right-hander Alex 
Storako, who has firmly established 
herself as the team’s second starter. 
Storako is often referred to as a 
“spin pitcher” by Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins, which has been 
evident in her 76 strikeouts across 
65.1 innings pitched. Opponents 
are managing a batting average of 
just .167 against Storako, but her 
2.14 ERA has taken a hit thanks in 
part to the 10 home runs she has 
surrendered.
Though her numbers aren’t as 
dominant as Beaubien and Stor-
ako’s, sophomore right-hander 
Sarah Schaefer provides value to 
the staff by inducing soft contact. 
Schaefer has recorded a 2.69 ERA 
across nine appearances thus far, a 

sizeable inflation from her 1.57 clip 
in 2018.
Catchers:
After taking over as the starting 
catcher midway through her soph-
omore year, senior captain Katie 
Alexander has established herself 
as one of the best backstops in the 
conference. She slugged her way 
to a .314 batting average with 24 
RBI while picking up second team 
All-Big Ten honors a season ago, 
but has struggled at the plate in the 
early stages of her senior campaign. 
Alexander enters the homestand 
with a .152 batting average in 17 
starts, but leads the team with three 
home runs and ranks second with 
11 RBI.
Freshman Hannah Carson — 
FloSoftball’s No. 21 2018 prospect 
— has assumed the backup catcher 
duties so far this season, despite 
junior catcher Abby Skvarce’s 
upper-hand in age. Carson tallied 
a .571 batting average and 31 home 
runs as a senior in high school en 
route to her fourth consecutive first 
team All-State selection.
First base:
This season’s starting first base-
man job has presented the biggest 
head-scratcher so far, following 
the graduation of Tera Blanco, a 
first team All-Big Ten selection in 
2018. It’s been a battle between 
senior Alex Sobczak and sopho-
more Taylor Bump since opening 
weekend, but neither player has 
much experience on the right side 
of the infield.
As of now, the position appears to 
belong to Sobczak, who entered 
the season with 63 career starts 
under her belt. On the other hand, 
Bump’s natural positions are third 
base and shortstop, meaning she is 
accustomed to playing defense on 
the other side of the infield. Neither 
player has put up big numbers at 
the plate so far this season, but 
Sobczak’s team-high .429 on-base 
percentage trumps Bump’s .250 
mark.
Second base:
Michigan’s lineup starts and ends 
with senior second baseman Faith 
Canfield — both literally and figura-
tively. The two-time All-American 
has firmly established herself as 
the leadoff hitter, and she comes 
into this weekend scorching hot 
after posting a .448 batting average 

during the team’s West Coast 
trip last week. Canfield spent her 
freshman season learning the ropes 
of her position from then-senior 
Sierra Romero, who took home 
2016 National Player of the Year 
honors. Now that Canfield is in her 
second year as captain, Hutchins 
wants to see her “take this team by 
the horns.”
Shortstop:
For the second straight season, 
sophomore Natalia Rodriguez 
will be the Wolverines’ everyday 
shortstop. Rodriguez registered a 
.250 batting average in 53 starts as a 
freshman, so her .333 mark thus far 
represents a massive leap forward. 
After recording 10 stolen bases on 
12 attempts last season, Rodriguez 
has already swiped five bags on as 
many tries in 2019.
Third base:
Last season, Madison Uden was 
Michigan’s breakout star. After 
finishing her freshman year with 
a .255 batting average in 12 starts, 
2018 brought about monumental 
success to the tune of a .357 average 
and 35 RBI. While the numbers 
prove that Uden stepped up as a 
hitter a season ago, her biggest de-
velopment came from a leadership 
standpoint — something evident in 
her teammates’ choice to nominate 
her as a 2019 captain, despite being 
just a junior.
One of this year’s early-season 
shocks has been Uden’s struggles at 
the plate. She limps into this week-
end with a .174 batting average — a 
183-point regression from 2018.
Outfield:
The Wolverines’ outfield corps has 
been their most consistent position 
group over the first month of the 
season. Freshman left fielder Lexie 
Blair has been a staple towards 
the top of the order, posting a .316 
batting average with a team-high 
eight doubles. Now in her third 
year as the starting center fielder, 
senior Natalie Peters is another 
staple of the lineup. She earned 
second team All-Big Ten honors 
in 2017 after posting a .361 batting 
average, but saw that number dip to 
.312 last season. When it comes to 
defense, junior right fielder Haley 
Hoogenraad is one of Michigan’s 
finest. Hoogenraad recorded 43 
putouts without committing an 
error a season ago.

Breaking down ‘M’ Softball’s 2019 roster

Navigating Uncharted Territory

Carol Hutchins said it better than any-
body: “This team has been a little bit of 
up and a little bit of down.”
The Wolverines head into home play 
with a 12-10 record, something that 
the Michigan coach, her players and 
the softball community at large aren’t 
accustomed to experiencing — nor 
could’ve predicted given the program’s 
precedence of dominance.
The team has weaknesses: namely, 
finding starters at first base and pitcher, 
hitting consistently and closing out 
tight games. But so does every team, as 
Hutchins said after practice Tuesday. 
This season still marked a change from 
the program’s typical preeminence, and 
the problem isn’t how players hold a 
bat or field a fly ball.
Michigan has a few 
choices to make. To 
focus or worry about 
their legacy. To hope 
for results or get them. 
To swing with author-
ity or think too much.
For so many years, 
Michigan held a 
mental acuity that 
allowed it to reach a 
pinnacle of excellence 
as a program, and this year has tested 
that focus. In game after game, players 
have pointed to mental struggles as the 
root cause of awry pitches, problems 
hitting and general strife on the field. 
The Wolverines know their problem. 
And while repeated mental lapses have 
certainly created new obstacles, they 
also present a new opportunity.
This is the first team the program has 
seen in years to face a recurring issue 
affecting performance. Sure, that’s 
not ideal, but it also sets the stage for 
greatness.
This team could be the one to face 
adversity and attack it. The Wolverines 
can show up at the plate, be ‘on’ men-
tally and perform at the level at which 
we know they’re capable from big wins 
against ranked opponents. They’ve 
identified the problem — now they just 
have to solve it.
To truly get to the root of the problem, 
though, Michigan has to look at why 
it keeps falling into mental lulls in the 
first place. The sixth inning of the Stan-
ford game, the first game in the LSU 
Invitational in Baton Rouge, La., pro-
vided a potential answer. After a strong 
start with a tied score of 1-1, sophomore 
left-hander Meghan Beaubien stepped 
in to relieve freshman right-hander 
Alex Storako in the circle. Beaubien let 
up four runs before Hutchins pulled 
her from the lineup mid-inning.
“You want to go into that situation with 
a clear head and just telling yourself to 
throw your game and that it’s going to 
work out,” Beaubien said. “What you 
don’t want to do is try too hard to get 
out of a situation or to get the results 

you wanted, and that’s what I was 
doing. I was trying too hard to get the 
results I wanted, and that leads to bad 
pitches.”
Like Beaubien, several players have 
found that after one discouragement, it 
becomes harder to avoid result-orient-
ed play — trying to force an outcome 
and forgetting to play freely. And when 
one player falls into that mentality, it 
can affect the entire team.
But in the same way that panic spreads 
quickly, so too does a revived team 
atmosphere.
“It’s a contagious effect,” Hutchins said. 
“When a couple of us (hit well), we’ve 
opened up. We did it against Arizona 
State. …When we’ve scored runs, it’s 
because we’ve only had to get a couple 
things going and then everybody takes 
the pressure off themselves.”
The Wolverines understand why they 
can beat No. 2 UCLA 
and almost defeat No. 9 
Louisiana State yet lose 
to unranked Louisville, 
North Carolina and 
the Cardinal. They’ve 
encountered mental 
setbacks, and they now 
have the chance to 
change their mental-
ity at home, proving 
resilience in the face 
of a rocky start. With 
comfortable winning records in the 
scorebooks the past 14 years, this is the 
first time in a long time Michigan has 
needed that spark. And the Wolverines 
have the chance to create that hungry 
mentality for themselves.
A major turning point in finding that 
rhythm also occurred in Baton Rouge, 
just four games after the loss to Stan-
ford. Playing a tough Tigers team with 
a home-field advantage, Michigan held 
strong defensively, eventually losing 
2-1, but playing with a passion and ease 
they lacked in previous contests.
“They’ve learned it at LSU, and they 
didn’t get the win, but they played 
to win it, and we played like that in 
California every game,” Hutchins said. 
“The jungle tiger doesn’t go in there 
and wonder or worry or hope he gets 
his prey. He goes in there to get it, or 
else he’s not going to eat.”
Two weeks ago, the program stood 
at a crux: carry on the success of the 
program or drop the ball, sliding into 
the team’s first losing season since 
recordkeeping began 14 years ago. Ten 
games later, the Wolverines remain on 
that precarious edge.
Michigan managed to claw its way 
back to a winning record. But to really 
cement themselves as the team that 
continued the success of a legendary 
program in the face of adversity, Team 
42 can’t just be “a little bit of up.” The 
team needs sustained ferocity, and the 
players know that.
And with the Wolverines returning to 
Ann Arbor this weekend, it’s time to 
see if they can survive in the jungle.

throw, I know she’ll be able to get it. 
She’ll be able to block it. I know she 
can throw runners out. She’s tough. 
She gives you a lot of confidence 
because she just has a presence. She’s 
very good at understanding my head 
knowing the right thing to say to get 
me back in the mindset to do what I 
need to do.”
One of the most important elements of 
Alexander’s legacy will be leaving the 
team in the capable hands of another 
catcher. That role will likely be filled 
by freshman catcher Hannah Carson. 
The two have already worked together 
in preparation of Carson eventually 
taking the reins. Although she hasn’t 
gotten many innings yet, Carson is 
next in line, now preparing for Alex-
ander to pass the torch. When Carson 
is playing, Alexander is always nearby, 
giving critiques on form, demon-
strating a play or offering a word of 
encouragement. 
Her advice to Carson has been clear: 
Be vocal; be confident; be the leader 
the team needs you to be. 
With softball legends like Tera Blanco, 
Megan Betsa and Kelly Christner 
to look up to, Alexander had many 
mentors to choose from as an under-
classman. 
“Every person that’s older than you or 
every person here, tries to make the 
people around them better,” Alex-
ander said. “I took something from 
almost every single person that I got 
the chance to play with.
“To be able to see what they did for me 
— what worked and what didn’t — and 
now I can use that for the underclass-
men.”
One lesson Alexander has impart-
ed, not just on Carson but all of the 
underclassmen, is the importance of 
commitment. 
“All years, they preach here that you’re 

a leader and you can be on the field,” 
Alexander said. “No matter how old 
you are, you can still have a say and 
that’s what’s going to make everybody 
else better. I really took pride in, no 
matter whether I was in the dugout or 
on the field or how old I was, I could 
be valuable to my teammates. That’s 
how we’re going to succeed: if every-
body puts in that much effort.”
With these types of sentiments, 
Alexander strives to emulate the same 
team culture that Seegert experienced 
in her time at Michigan, a collective 
atmosphere upheld by team traditions 
like a “no phone” rule or writing in the 
dirt before each game. 
It is this culture that has lead the 
Wolverines to 20 Big Ten Conference 
Championships, 18 All-American 
players and one NCAA World Series 
victory — a level of play Alexander 
would love to see again from her team. 
As the season gets into full swing 
and Michigan bounces between hard 
losses and easy wins, Alexander is not 
satisfied — she rarely has been.
In her freshman year of high school, 
Alexander could have been satisfied 
sticking to second base on Saline’s 
junior varsity team.
When she got to Michigan four years 
ago, she could have accepted that she’d 
get little playing time as a walk-on. 
As errors plummeted and her batting 
average soared, she could have been 
happy with her role as starting catcher, 
content in being remembered — just 
like her high school coach — as one of 
the strongest catchers in Michigan’s 
history. But instead, she’s gone above 
and beyond, serving the team as a 
leader and mentor, on and off the field. 
Regardless of the number of runs 
she’s scored or runners she’s thrown 
out, Katie Alexander’s legacy will be 
defined by one thing: her drive.

Society 
has 
had 
many 
cultural rebirths, and I have 
always wanted the same for 
myself. But not just a new 
chapter of my life. I waste 
too many hours pondering a 
literal rebirth — if I could be 
born again in another time 
and experience my personal 
renaissance 
in 
a 
different 
way. It’s a shame that the only 
renaissance I’ve been (un)
lucky enough to be present 
for is the rise of social media. 
Of course I got to be there for 
the phenomenon that would 
enable 
my 
mental 
health 
hitting the gutter in high 
school. It feels like I missed 
out on all too much.
What if I’d been born in 
1973, and got to grow up with 
the birth and golden age of 
hip hop? I’d be six years old 
when the Sugar Hill Gang 
dropped “Rapper’s Delight,” 
surely dancing to it with all 
my friends in front of the 
boom box at the playground. 
I imagine being fourteen when 
Paid in Full came out. I would 
close my locker and look to 
my friend beside me, wearing 
overalls with one strap off, and 
say, “Yo, you hear the new Eric 
B. and Rakim?” (According 
to my dad, who was indeed 
fourteen the year Paid in 
Full came out, this highly-

important question was on the 
mouth of every kid in school 
when he came back in the 
fall). Instead of crying over 
Mac Miller, I would have been 
there shedding tears when 
I first heard about Tupac’s 
untimely death.
I imagine if I’d been 16 at 
the height of drive-in movie 
theatres. 
It’s 
the 
summer 
of 1956, and I’m behind the 
wheel of my dad’s Buick only 
days after getting my license. 
Beside me is the most beautiful 
girl in the school, Tina Jane 
with the blond curls, and we’re 
watching “Rebel Without a 
Cause.” Inches separate our 
shoulders. Nothing is on my 
mind other than her, and I can 
hardly focus on the movie — 
I’m trying my hardest to keep 
it cool, making a silent prayer 
for my first kiss.
Maybe if I got to experience 
my 20s in the ’20s, I would be 
living in New York, freshly 
graduated and dancing for the 
first time at a lavish party on 
Long Island’s North Shore. I’d 
rock the brown wool, peak-
lapel, four-button jacket and 
a light pink cotton dress shirt 
with french cuffs. I’d match 
it with sleek brown cap toes 
and a diagonal striped tie — 
deep burgundy, forest green 
and golden brown. Relaxing 
on the balcony after hours 
of dancing, I’d look up to the 
stars, sipping champagne as 
the live music beat on, boats 

against the current, borne 
back ceaselessly into the past 
(“The Great Gatsby”).
Is there a place for me, even 
further back and farther away?
At my heart, I am a born-
and-raised product of the 21st 
century. At fourteen, I got to 
be there when Drake’s Nothing 
Was the Same came out — 
which is cool, but substantially 
less cool than experiencing the 
new Eric B. and Rakim. There 
was no glamorous first kiss in 
Dad’s Buick with a curly-blond 
bombshell — I took my first date 
to the regular movie theater, 
awkwardly held hands during 
“The Fault in Our Stars,” and 
only had a nervous “i had 
fun :)” text to show for it. My 
first party was not in a fancy 
oceanside mansion but in a 
cramped basement. There was 
no champagne, just Costco-
brand vodka and Mike’s Hard 
Lemonade. Admittedly, I don’t 
see any Gatsby-style roaring 
’20s parties in my future.
Maybe 
it’s 
not 
so 
bad. 
Maybe there’s no time better 
than now to grow into myself. 
After all, most of my closest 
friends are of racial and sexual 
identities that didn’t have a 
space in society until now, and 
I wouldn’t have become who 
I am without them in my life. 
I still do yearn for a rebirth, 
to get a taste of a pastime I 
never had. But my golden age 
is today, and I think that’s 
perfectly okay.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW: ‘BINZ’

The best part about a new 
Solange album is that we’re 
always spoiled with movie-
quality music videos to go 
with it. And with her latest 
release, When I Get Home, we 
practically got a full movie, 
a precisely choreographed 
half-hour long companion 
piece and surreal love 
letter to the artist’s origins 
in Houston’s Third Ward. 
Solange 
dropped 
five 
minutes of it on YouTube as 
a music video for “Almeda,” 
stitching 
together 
the 
“Nothing 
Without 
Intention” interlude with 
the standout song of the 
album, a Playboi Carti-
featuring, jazzy flip on 
the chopped and screwed 
genre. The “Almeda” video 
is a well-oiled machine, with 
legions of dancers orbiting 
perfectly 
around 
Solange, 
Houston locales and even a 
fleet of DeLoreans.
While Solange deserves an 
immense level of respect for 
her dedication to precisely 

curating 
this 
mechanical 
aesthetic in her music videos 
and promotional material, an 
unedited and unrehearsed 
slice into the artist’s life can 
be a breath of fresh air. This is 

what we get with the “Binz” 
music video: 86 seconds of 
Solange spinning, popping, 
twisting and twerking in 
front of a webcam.
“Binz” 
is 
low 
quality, 
but it’s not low effort. To 
a particular eye, Solange’s 
movements 
could 
seem 

incredibly 
precise 
and 
purposeful, as she dances 
around in a variety of outfits 
that probably cost more than 
University tuition, but it still 
maintains a carefree vibe. 
There’s no better fit for the 
song — “Binz” breezes. It’s a 
lazy sprint, reveling in taking 
it slow. Solange doesn’t even 
bother to start her verse until 
halfway through: “I just 
wanna wake up to the suns 
and Saint Laurent / Hundred 
thousand 
dollars 
on 
the 
fronts and the blunts.” “Binz” 
is the sun breaking through 
the grey sky on a muzzy 
March day, warming us up to 
90 degree afternoons but not 
giving them to us quite yet. 
Solange is aware the summer 
heat will soon creep through 
the clouds, and dances with 
an incessant smile on her face 
for what’s to come.

For much longer than I can 
remember, 
my 
grandma 
has 
owned a little blue cabin on the 
shores 
of 
Intermediate 
Lake, 
Michigan. And when I say cabin, 
I don’t mean one of those quaint-
yet-simultaneously-the-cost-of-
my-tuition cottages. I mean leaky 
roof, one bathroom, zebra mussel 
cabin. I mean memory filled, 
unconventionally beautiful, blue 
heaven cabin. This is the cabin 
where I grew up for one week 
every summer. I traveled up with 
my family, bunked with my sister 
(literally — we had bunk beds) and 
delighted in a whole week void of 
responsibilities and reality.
Every time I returned to my 
blue heaven, it embraced me with 
consistency. The rickety dock from 
little feet running to see crayfish, 
the crumbling fire pit from nights 
of s’more contests and campfire 
discussions, the sandy carpet 
from days spent making teetering 
towers and temporary tapestries, 
all reminded me of summer spent 
in sameness. Each year we spent 
in a similar simplicity: We would 
lounge on the beach, go into town 
for penny candy, visit Pirates Cove 

for mini golf, lounge on the beach 
some more.
But the most relaxing part of 
the vacation was not our little 
excursions, or lack thereof, but 
that it acted as an excursion from 
everyday life. That little cabin is 
where, for one week every summer, 
I escaped to a place untouched by 
time. No outside world existed; my 
worries of the approaching school 
year, friendship drama clouding 
my thoughts and fears of what the 
coming year would bring all faded 
away. Instead, my anxieties went 
out with the lazy tide, my worries 
melted under the summer sun. As 
I laid in the hammock with my 
book and ukulele, my little blue 
cabin harbored me from the only 
constant in my life: change.
We are always changing and 
growing, undergoing our own little 
renaissances. And that is a beautiful 
thing. The fact that we are always a 
work in progress means we always 
have the capacity to improve, 
learn and flourish. What typically 
prompts us to change are our 
experiences, whether we have a 
hand in bringing them about or not. 
Events that change our lives force 
us to adapt and evolve, leading to a 
change within ourselves. 
But while this constant growth 
does benefit us, it can sometimes 

be exhausting. Living in such a fast 
paced world forces us to change 
due to outside forces, not because 
we have any desire or reason 
to change. Rarely do we get the 
chance to stand back and think 
about who we have become and 
who we want to be. Rarely do we 
control our own renaissance.
But away from the real world, in 
the timeless blue cabin, I do control 
my renaissance. I can grow on my 
own terms. I can read books, play 
instruments, explore nature. I can 
stop and think and just be, which 
sometimes is the most important 
form of growth. While life comes to 
a standstill on the edge of the lake, I 
can decide where to go from there.
Of course, not everything can 
truly stay the same. The zebra 
mussels are still as annoying as 
ever, but the leaky roof has long 
since been fixed and the bathroom 
has expanded. And I never truly 
escape reality. But for one week 
every summer, I find shelter. My 
blue heaven has watched me grow 
up and move through my own 
renaissance, but it has always 
stayed the same, granting me the 
space to evolve in the ways I need 
the most, comforting me with 
safety and simplicity. My blue safe 
haven is where my renaissance is in 
my control.

B-SIDE: COMMUNITY CULTURE

DANA PIERANGELI
Daily Arts Writer

I often find myself longing to 
live in another decade. My personal 
favorite? The ’70s. The heyday 
of rock ‘n’ roll, the golden age of 
hippie counterculture and the open 
passion for love that comes with it. 
My urge for this time travel comes 
at trivial moments in a day, such as 
when I’m in an elevator surrounded 
by five people all staring down at 
their phones, faces illuminated by 
harsh, unwelcoming blue light. 
Or when I’m walking through the 
Arb and see students in hammocks 
staring into their screens. When 
did life become so antisocial, 
the need for human contact and 
conversation replaced with small 
devices that now contain our whole 
world?
And that’s just it — I think 
my 
yearning 
to 
escape 
our 
contemporary 
world 
stems 
from technology. It’s a love-hate 
relationship, 
a 
double-edged 
sword. Our generation grew up 
at a pivotal time. We watched 
Saturday morning cartoons on 
CRT box televisions and marveled 
at flip phones 15 years ago, and 
now find ourselves setting screen-
time limits on our own devices, 
stored somewhere within reach 
at all times. We grew up in the 
midst of a massive technological 
revolution, and it shows. Turning 
to our screens became our study 
break, our escape from boredom on 
long summer days and our primary 
method of communication.
Technology is so ingrained in 
our lives that we forget what it was 
like to live without it. But there’s a 
great remedy.
***
Summer 
2014: 
My 
thighs 
graze against each other as I walk 
through the cobblestone streets, 
the humidity hanging in the air 
like a thick, woolen blanket. I’ve 
just finished my freshman year of 
high school (oh, the innocence!), 
a year mostly spent wearing my 
thick black curls in two pigtails on 

the sides of my head. I know you’re 
already thinking it so I’ll confirm it: 
They looked atrocious. My hair was 
the least of my worries, though, 
with the Italian country beckoning 
me to explore.
Rambling through those narrow 
streets, some so tight that cars can’t 
drive through, it’s easy to forget 
the world that we live in. When 
you’re surrounded by churches, 
plazas and statues built during the 
Renaissance, you start to believe 
that you’re living in it. Tourists 
with bulky backpacks leading 
their gelato-laden children by the 
hand fade into the periphery. Only 
the baroque buildings with pure 
white trim surrounding their sides 
remain. If I’d turned a corner and 
seen Raphael painting the “School 
of 
Athens” 
or 
Michelangelo 
sculpting the “Pietà,” I wouldn’t 
have been surprised.
Take, 
for 
example, 
the 
Pantheon. The colossal dome, built 
during the reign of the Roman 
empire in 27 BCE, sits in the center 
of the aptly named Piazza della 
Rotonda. Easily one of the most 
crowded piazzas in Rome, it took 
my family ten minutes to walk a 
hundred feet to the nearest gelato 
shop and stumble back to the 
center of the square. Sitting there, 
slowly numbing my tongue with 
the dark chocolate cream (the only 
gelato flavor I truly enjoy), I turned 
my eyes to the inscription on the 
front facade of the Pantheon: “M. 
AGRIPPA L.F. COS TERTIUM 
FECIT.” 
Translated: 
“Marcus 
Agrippa, son of Lucius, three-
time counsel, made this.” I looked 
back down and imagined this 
place as it was all those years ago, 
when polytheism still reigned and 
Roman citizens used the Pantheon 
as a temple. The gelato shop 
replaced with tumbledown houses, 
shambles compared to modern-day 
Rome. Whoever Marcus Agrippa 
is, he let me live in the past for 
a fleeting second, and for that, I 
thank him.
The same feeling overcame me 
when I stepped into Santa Maria 

Maggiore, a church nestled in 
the northern part of Rome, a city 
with over 900 churches. Churches 
are hands-down the best way to 
see Italy; we were told this by our 
taxi driver on our first day in the 
city in broken English with brief 
interludes of rapid Italian. But we 
got the jist: Go see the churches. 
Touring all of them would take 
forever, so our driver narrowed 
it down for us, promptly listing 
off the four most “important” in 
Rome. Santa Maria Maggiore was 
one of them.
I almost laughed out loud when 
I walked inside. Our taxi driver 
should have been named tour 
guide of the year. Sweeping marble 
columns towered over my five-foot 
frame, silently calling me to look 
up to the gold-leafed ceiling. The 
main passage and pews glowed 
with yellow light, but the dark, 
silent alcoves branching from the 
sides were much more compelling. 
Each one contained a statue or a 
painting — I found myself face-to-
face with countless Virgin Marys, 
baby angels and kings, sculpted to 
precision. What was it like to live 
here, during a period of such rapid 
advances in art? When people 
were drawn in three dimensions, 
not flat in typical medieval style. 
When a block of marble was all that 
artists like Gian Lorenzo Bernini, 
widely regarded as one of the best 
sculptors to ever live, needed to 
carve a masterpiece.
Travel is my method of fleeing 
from this era for a week or two, 
a way of living in another time 
while not really being there at all. 
It’s fleeting, but it’s eye-opening. 
I cherish everything from short 
road-trips to national parks to 
international 
flights 
because 
there’s nothing better than being 
in the thick of things, right where 
all the action happened. Gems like 
Michelangelo’s “Moses” in Rome 
or Bernini’s “Ecstacy of Saint 
Teresa” shine light on what the 
Italian Renaissance really was: a 
different way of living, a different 
world.

How ‘The Decameron’ 
launched the Renaissance

WIKIMEDIA COMMONS

SOPHIE WASLOWSKI
Daily Arts Writer

B-SIDE: BOOKS

I didn’t know the book had a 
naked woman on it when I asked 
for it as a Christmas present. 
I had first heard of it from my 
world history teacher in high 
school, in an offhand comment 
during one of her tangents I 
had come to know could be as 
educational as the class material 
itself. She had been lecturing 
on the Italian Renaissance that 
day, about enlightenment and 
scientific reasoning, when she 
stopped mid-sentence and asked 
if we had heard of Giovanni 
Boccaccio. Met with only blank 
stares, she launched into a 
speech about how Boccaccio’s 
“The 
Decameron” 
was 
an 
extremely influential work of 
fiction and above all the very 
manifestation of fun itself.
I 
was 
intrigued 
by 
her 
description of the book but 
didn’t think much of it until my 
aunt asked me what I wanted 
for Christmas. I couldn’t think 
of anything, until suddenly 
“The Decameron” came to my 
mind. I loved reading and was 
always looking for a good book, 
so I thought I’d give it a try and 
see whether or not it was all my 
teacher claimed it was.
I didn’t realized what I was 
getting myself into until my 
aunt called the next day, asking 
if my mother thought “The 
Decameron” was an appropriate 
gift for a fourteen year old. 
“There’s a naked lady on the 
cover,” I heard her inform my 
mother over the phone. My 
mother assured her it was fine 
and said I’d heard about it from 
a respected teacher. “I just 
wanted to make sure you were 
aware,” was my aunt’s reply. 
After my mother had hung up 
the phone, she asked me what 
the book was about. I realized 
I had no idea, so I simply 
shrugged and said “the Italian 
Renaissance.”
On Christmas Eve, as my 
family 
finished 
dinner 
and 

began watching our traditional 
holiday movies, our phone rang. 
No one thought much of it at 
first. My father excused himself 
to answer it and when he came 
back I could tell from the 
expression on his face that it was 
“the call.” The one that crossed 
my mind every time the phone 
rang, that made my heart speed 
up and my hands begin to sweat. 
The one we had been waiting 
for since the nurses told us my 
grandmother wasn’t doing well, 
and that we should visit if we 
wanted to say goodbye.
My grandmother died that 
night and I did not know 
what to do. She was the only 
grandparent I had known and 
with one phone call she was 
gone. It was a delicate dance 
of balancing our grief and 
celebrating Christmas. We cried 
that night but opened presents 
the next day. It was strange 
and 
uncomfortable, 
a 
new 
territory none of us knew how 
to navigate. My parents spoke to 
my relatives to plan her funeral 
and arrange travel itineraries, 
while I sat in my room, unsure 
of what exactly I was supposed 
to be doing.
I 
started 
reading 
“The 
Decameron” 
then, 
partly 
because I didn’t know what 
else to do and partly because 
I always read, and reading 
made things feel more normal 
in a way. I soon discovered 
“The Decameron” was about 
a group of friends who go to 
the countryside to wait out the 
Black Death and pass the time 
by telling each other stories. The 
work is set up as a frame story, 
or a series of smaller stories 
within one larger, overarching 
story. The main story is that of 
the friends trying to escape the 
plague, while the smaller stories 
are the ones they tell each other. 
Ten stories are told each day and 
each day has a certain theme. 
The themes range from trickster 
stories to adventures that go 
wrong but end happily, among 
others.
Although I didn’t realize it 

at the time, “The Decameron,” 
which Boccaccio wrote around 
1353, was arguably one of the 
most influential works written 
during 
the 
Renaissance. 
The majority of writing and 
published work before “The 
Decameron” 
focused 
on 
religion 
or 
the 
aristocracy. 
“The Decameron” marked a 
shift toward literature about 
everyday people. It focuses 
not on lords or wealthy royals, 
but a group of commoners. It 
provided average people with 
the rare chance to read a book in 
which they were the stars.
After “The Decameron,” there 
was an increase in work written 
with a frame-story structure, 
something that arguably laid the 
groundwork for the structure of 
Cervantes’ “Don Quixote.” “Don 
Quixote” is considered by many 
to be the first real “novel” that 
resembles the novels in modern 
day society. By extension, it 
can be said “The Decameron” 
helped make the novels we have 
today possible.
Beyond its influence during 
and after the Renaissance, what 
struck me the most about the 
novel was the way it grappled 
with death and mortality. It 
was written in the wake of one 
of the most devastating plagues 
humans have known, yet the 
stories themselves are mostly 
about having fun. It’s a work 
filled with wit, humor and 
stories about humans following 
their desires and simply having 
a good time. As one of the blurbs 
on the back of my copy stated, 
“It’s purely a celebration of 
being alive.”
Essentially, 
Boccaccio’s 
response to such death and 
destruction was to live. To 
enjoy life while it’s possible 
to and pursue happiness and 
fulfillment 
without 
holding 
back. In the wake of my 
grandmother’s death, it helped 
me see that life in a way is more 
meaningful because it does not 
last forever, and we must try to 
make the most of the time we 
have.

“The world is getting faster, 
more complicated and more 
fucked up, so there are always 
larger 
problems 
to 
solve 
and new frontiers to make 
accessible,” said Jack Kornet, 
Stamps School of Art & Design 
junior.
Kornet uses his graphic 
design 
skills 
to 
address 
challenges he or his clients 
face. His work ranges from 
creating event branding for 
startup Ann Arbor SPARK 
to freelancing for Systematic 
Vision, a high speed camera 
supplier and system integrator 
based in Boston.
“My 
favorite 
part 
about 
design work is that it’s not 
work,” Kornet wrote in an 
email 
interview 
with 
The 
Daily. “I have an unreasonable 
amount of fun solving problems 
with creativity. There seems to 
always be more to learn about 
design. I have never gotten 
bored with it, and I’m not sure 
I ever will because there are so 
many potential projects.”
A significant reason for the 
rise of graphic design is the 
mass amounts of information 
we have access to and consume 
on 
a 
daily 
basis 
due 
to 
smartphones and social media. 
In an age where we’re simply 
seconds away from sharing 
or reading information, the 
manner in which we display 
text 
and 
visuals 
becomes 
important.
“If you’re trying to portray 
information, 
then 
graphic 
design is the best medium 
of art to do so,” said Stamps 
School 
of 
Art 
& 
Design 
sophomore Eliana Harrison in 
an interview with The Daily. 

Harrison has created posters 
for Ann Arbor’s “Shakespeare 
in 
the 
Arb,” 
designed 
promotional flyers for student-
run theater group RC Players 
and more.
But while we may think of 
graphic design work as being 
an art form born from the 
modernization of technology, 
it’s been around for much 
longer, 
starting 
from 
the 
Renaissance as the invention of 
movable-type printing allowed 
for the rapid spread of ideas.
“In 
the 
Renaissance, 
artists began to value gaining 
knowledge of materials and 
subject matter and their effects 
on the viewer which I see to be 
on the same train of thought 
as modern designers,” Kornet 
wrote. “The main connection 
I see between Renaissance art 
and modern design is the role 
of a cultural influencer. In 
the Renaissance, art could be 
used to represent important 
people. Artists would create 
lasting relics of identity and 
reputation for their ‘clients’ 
which is very similar in my 
mind to corporate branding 
(logos, the look and feel and 
messaging).”
Just as the printing press 
allowed for the Renaissance 
in Europe, the Internet has 
allowed for a revitalization of 
graphic design throughout the 
world.
“Everything 
came 
from 
the 
Renaissance,” 
Harrison 
said. “Even if you look at art 
nouveau, which was almost 
a very early form of graphic 
design — they did a lot of 
posters for the world’s fairs — 
they drew from the styles of 
the Renaissance. And I think 
that has evolved into modern 
graphic design.”

The 
main 
difference 
between design work from 
the Renaissance compared to 
today is the purpose behind it.
“Where 
Renaissance 
art 
involved itself with political, 
religious 
and 
intellectual 
promotion, design today is used 
in the construction of public 
infrastructure, 
consumer 
products 
and 
basically 
everything,” 
Kornet 
wrote. 
“This 
adds 
a 
tremendous 
amount of possibilities for 
creative projects because the 
range of people who value 
design is much broader than 
that during the Renaissance.”
This added creativity and 
purpose 
behind 
graphic 
design work is what appeals 
to many artists like Harrison. 
Harrison started out training 
in contemporary realist art 
before shifting some of her 
focus towards graphic design 
work.
Harrison 
thinks 
creating 
work for a client is what 
distinguishes graphic design 
from other forms of art. She’s 
fond 
of 
learning 
people’s 
visions and thinking about the 
overall message they hope to 
convey as she makes her work.
“I love the fact that graphic 
design is such a practical use 
of art in order to advertise, 
market and brand companies 
and people,” Harrison said. 
“I think it’s awesome I can do 
that for people.”
No matter what the message 
or vision is for a design, it 
often circles back to the people 
themselves.
“Design is a deeply human 
practice, and it takes a lot of 
empathy to design things that 
other people will love,” Kornet 
wrote. “The process is both 
gratifying and eye-opening.”

The steadiness of ‘Romeo 
and Juliet’ across time

WALT DISNEY STUDIOS MOTION PICTURES

B-SIDE: FILM

The popularity of star-crossed 
lovers is anything but tragic — 
we relish in the misfortune of 
the characters and celebrate 
when, against all odds, the two 
manage to find a way. The most 
famous pair is, of course, Romeo 
and Juliet. We all know their 
story: Two teenagers fall in love 
and, eventually, both die due to 
a serious lack of communication 
skills. Such a simple and, at this 
point, cliché idea. Yet, the play 
remains a staple on high school 
reading lists and Hollywood 
continually 
uses 
this 
Italian 
Renaissance-era tale in a variety 
of modern-day remakes.
“Gnomeo and Juliet,” a 2011 
retelling, follows two gnomes 
from rival gardens in their quest 

for love. Emily Blunt (“A Quiet 
Place”) 
and 
James 
McAvoy 
(“Glass”) star in the Disney 
remake that never truly strays 
from the original, aside from the 
occasional break into song and 
dance and the fact that Romeo and 
Juliet are, in fact, gnomes. The 
movie even tries to open with the 
famous first lines from the play, 
but it eventually devolves into 
a peppy depiction of the black-
and-white or, rather, blue-and-
red, feud between the Capulets 
and Montagues. “Gnomeo and 
Juliet” far from set the standard 
for “Romeo and Juliet” retellings, 
but it was a colorful take on the 
classic.
A better known, and a little 
more subtle, remake is one of my 
personal favorites: “High School 
Musical.” The warring families 
take the form of Troy’s jock family 
and Gabriella’s beloved geeks 

all in East High’s own fair Verona: 
An obscenely nice cafeteria in 
Albuquerque, New Mexico. On 
top of that, Chad (Corbin Bleu, 
“Jump In”), in the form of several 
basketball-related puns, brings 
new life to Mercutio’s character 
while Taylor (Monique Coleman, 
“Broken Star), as captain of the 
Scholastic 
Decathlon 
team, 
provides the manic energy of 
Juliet’s nurse. Like most family-
friendly remakes of “Romeo and 
Juliet,” there is no death (unless 
you count that of Sharpay and 
Ryan’s theater careers), but there 
is a major fight scene ending with 
Gabriella’s lunch on Sharpay.
Maybe 
the 
“High 
School 
Musical” comparison is a bit 
of a stretch, but it does beg the 
question: What makes these 
remakes 
so 
popular? 
People 
obviously still enjoy the play, and 
without it nobody would truly 

understand the ramifications of 
two people falling in love, despite 
every Magic 8 ball telling them 
“Outlook not so good.” But then, 
why not just see the original? The 
classic response is that retellings 
give the play accessibility, that 
by 
simplifying 
Shakespeare’s 
original work into something 
more “palatable” it becomes a 
piece for the masses. But modern-
day 
spin-offs 
of 
“Romeo 
and 
Juliet” lose the 
ridiculousness 
of two teenagers 
(one not even old 
enough 
to 
give 
consent!) falling in 
love in the span of 
two days, all while 
their families are 
fighting 
for 
no 
obvious 
reason 
and biting their 
thumbs at one another.
That’s 
what 
makes 
film 
adaptations so appealing — no 
one is putting their own spin 
on Shakespeare’s famous take 
(which, 
for 
all 
intents 
and 
purposes, was a remake in 
itself.) In 1968, Franco Zeffirelli 
brought us a “Romeo and Juliet” 

with few changes and Olivia 
Hussey (“Social Suicide,” another 
“Romeo and Juliet” remake that 
brought Hussey and her co-star 
together again) with her intense 
eyes, bringing a sophisticated air 
to Juliet that is missing when a 
high school freshman reads the 
play in their head. Not only that, 
but Leonard Whiting (“Social 
Suicide”) is a Zac Efron look-alike 

— if that’s not proof that “High 
School Musical” is a “Romeo and 
Juliet” spin-off, I don’t know 
what is.
The 
most 
famous 
of 
the 
remakes, however, stars the one-
and-only 
Leonardo 
DiCaprio 
(“Titanic”). A renaissance man in 
name as well as looks, DiCaprio’s 

1996 performance as Romeo was 
flawless — the boyish charm and 
agonizingly “passionate” death 
of the enamored teenager was a 
perfect practice run for Jack in 
“Titanic.” Claire Danes (“A Kid 
like Jake”), like Hussey, turned 
Juliet from a whiny 13-year-
old girl to a slightly less whiny 
but still naïve 17-year-old ’90s 
chick. Luhrmann’s take on this 
definitive storyline demonstrates 
that it is very possible to make an 
appealing and dramatic version 
of “Romeo and Juliet” without 
relying on gimmicks like gnomes 
or even modern day language. 
The beauty of Shakespeare’s 
English isn’t taken away to 
make the movie more palatable; 
instead, “Romeo and Juliet” and 
its characters are imbued with 
’90s fashion and grime only 
serving to make the play even 
more passionate and heartfelt 
than the original.
This 
renaissance 
of 
Shakespeare’s 
“Romeo 
and 
Juliet” in film has helped the play 
maintain relevance and adapt to 
changing technology. The classic 
tale is, and will forever remain, 
a pillar in romantic movies for 
years to come.

HBO

At the outset of its creation, 
television was an indicator 
of status. Only the rich could 
have more than four channels, 
a colored screen and a TV 
larger than a window. Now, 
television is one of the most 
accessible forms of media. 
With 
streaming 
services 
galore and channels cranking 
out new content every day, we 
appear to be in the midst of a 
renaissance of television — or 
perhaps, reaching the end of 
one.
Let’s take a step back for a 
second — 7,368 steps back to be 
exact. That is how many days 
its been since “The Sopranos” 
debuted 
on 
HBO. 
The 
premiere of “The Sopranos” 
marks the beginning of the 
TV renaissance, essentially 
making 
David 
Chase 
the 
television 
equivalent 
of 
Masolino or DaVinci. Before 
“The 
Sopranos,” 
television 
was nothing more than a 
medium of distraction for 
middle 
class 
Americans. 
Then 
Tony 
Soprano 
lost 
his ducks, and the entire 
country sat at attention. “The 
Sopranos” showed viewers 
that television could be deep, 
heartfelt, witty and brutal all 
at once. It ended the parade 
of loveable characters whose 
only job on screen was to 
appear relatable and deliver 
polished one liners, and paved 
the way for 20 years of top-
notch television.
Then came the early 21st 
century, 
and 
TV 
screens 
were flooded with audacious 
programs. First up was David 
Simon’s 
“The 
Wire,” 
an 
intrepid pursuit to follow the 
narcotics scene of Baltimore 
through the eyes of both the 
drug dealers and those trying 
to stop them. Then came 
“Lost,” “Dexter,” “Breaking 
Bad” and “Mad Men,” all truly 
incredible shows (yes, that 
alpha male in your life was 
right about one thing) that 
developed cult followings and 
stay relevant and beloved to 
this day.
Of 
course, 
the 
golden 
age of television is not to 
the 
credit 
of 
only 
these 
dramatic, masculinity-heavy 
expositions. 
Comedy, 
too, 

saw a rise in both popularity 
and quality as the 2000s 
progressed. 
With 
sitcom 
staples like “Seinfeld” and 
“Friends” coming to an end in 
the late ’90s and early 2000s 
respectively, new half-hour 
comedies 
were 
a 
highly-
demanded 
luxury. 
Larry 
David’s 
recently-rebooted 
“Curb Your Enthusiasm” took 
care of that need, swooping in 
at such a perfect time it’s as 
if David ended “Seinfeld” for 
the sole purpose of replacing 
it with this show. Soon after, 
shows 
including 
“Scrubs,” 
“Arrested Development,” “It’s 
Always Sunny in Philadelphia” 
and “30 Rock” came marching 
onto American screens like 
a militia dedicated to the 
preservation of great comedy, 
and this is all before 2010.
Coming into the 2010s, 

television had already been 
established by the previously 
mentioned shows to be a 
complex and dynamic form 
of media. Yet there was still a 
glaring problem: TV was still 
pretty white. Casts were full 
of homogenous people leading 
fairly similar lives, with the 
occasional 
token 
minority 
thrown in as a sidekick or the 
butt of a joke. The growth 
of television in the 2010s 
came with the growth of 
representation, ranging from 
the inclusion of people of color 
to the LGBTQ community in 
all kinds of roles. Netflix’s 
“Orange Is the New Black” 
is an early example of this, 
depicting 
trans 
women, 
lesbian 
relationships 
and 
complex characters of color 

in a popular, groundbreaking 
show. 
Of 
course, 
the 
setting of a prison creates 
a 
problematic 
association 
with these characters, but 
it laid the groundwork for 
later shows to take the reins 
in representation to fight the 
ingrained television principle 
that only middle class white 
Americans can be cast as 
primary characters.
Looking at television today, 
you’ll see an array of faces, 
backgrounds and storylines 
that are starting to align more 
equally with what being an 
“American” 
means. 
Shows 
like “Brooklyn 99,” “blackish,” 
“One Day at a Time” and 
“Master of None” are diverse 
and 
tackle 
contemporary 
issues 
without 
making 
them the forefront of their 
storylines. The renaissance 
of television has experienced 
a renaissance within itself 
— 
one 
of 
representation. 
Though media representation 
is nowhere near matched to 
the population of the United 
States, it is on the rise, from 
primetime comedies to Disney 
Channel originals.
Some will say that the 
golden age of television is 
coming to a storied end. 
There is so much television 
now 
that 
the 
market 
is 
oversaturated, 
reaching 
a 
slow but sure collapse. While 
many iconic shows are ending 
this year — including “Broad 
City,” “Veep” and “Game of 
Thrones” — that’s not to say 
that even greater shows won’t 
take their place. There was a 
time nobody could imagine a 
world beyond “The Sopranos,” 
“Lost” or “Breaking Bad,” 
but here we are. People will 
always look for something 
accessible and entertaining 
to rally around, to bond 
with millions of strangers 
and see themselves in the 
faces of characters they love. 
Maybe you can’t stand sitting 
through a two-hour film or 
the thought of trying to figure 
out which music streaming 
service to subscribe to makes 
you want to scream. There will 
always be a Homer Simpson to 
laugh at, a Carrie Bradshaw 
to aspire to, a Don Draper to 
hate, a Lorelai Gilmore to cry 
with. They may just have a 
different face.

Tracking the rise and the 
fall of TV’s golden age

B-SIDE: TV

Comedy, too, 
saw a rise in 
both popularity 
and quality 
and the 2000s 
progressed.

WIKIMEDIA COMMONS

Flipping through the channel 
guide over spring break, I 
stumbled across an early 2000s 
gem in my Florida-heat fueled 
haze: 
“Hannah 
Montana.” 
For those readers who are 
(sadly) unfamiliar with 
the 
show, 
“Hannah 
Montana” 
was 
a 
children’s 
television 
program from Disney’s long-
gone Golden Age. The show 
followed the shenanigans of a 
teenage popstar: By day, she 
was Miley Stewart, a “normal” 
teenage girl; by night, the 
international celebrity, Hannah 
Montana. As I reminisced while 
binging, my thoughts swirled 
around the program’s iconic 
catchphrase and the refrain of 
its title song, “You get the best 
of 
both 
worlds.” 
This 
concept of maintaining 
dual identities was true to 
both the show, and Miley 
Cyrus’s 
actual 
career. 
“Hannah Montana” was 
Cyrus’s alter-ego, a way 
for Cyrus to maintain a 
normal life while also 
pursuing a very public 
career.
This idea of cultivating 
a separate, public image 
has also been significant 
within the greater music 
industry, too. Having a 
public image, or alter-
ego, allowed artists to 
push 
boundaries 
and 
focus on their careers 
without 
compromising 
their personal lives. Take, 
for instance, Lady Gaga 
and stunts like the iconic 
meat dress. Her early 
public image catered to 
the 
shocking, 
strange 
and creative, and these 
displays 
significantly 
contributed 
to 
Lady 
Gaga’s 
ascension to global fame. In 
turn, the persona “Lady Gaga” 
protected the creator, Stefani 
Germanotta, from the darker 
edge of fame.
Of course, the practice of 
crafting a particular celebrity 
image hasn’t been used by 
all artists, nor has it always 
been successful. For some, it 
may have been necessary — 
whether to grab attention, or 
to preserve some treasured 
privacy — while for others, it 

may have simply been for fun. 
After all, who hasn’t envisioned 
what their stage name might 
be, or who they could be, with 
a little fame (and a little money, 
too). Some artists have even 
utilized temporary identities 
to produce and perform music 
that otherwise conflicted with 
their already developed image: 
Think of David Bowie’s “Ziggy 
Stardust,” or Hank Williams’s 
“Luke the Drifter.” And while 
Hannah 
Montana’s 
fan-base 
was limited to prepubescent 
youth, the concept of “Hannah 
Montana” 
— 
what 
she 
represented, and how she came 
into being — exemplifies this 
practice of separating private 
and personal life within the 
public spotlight.
The music industry, however, 
is changing. The public of the 
21st century is demanding a 

reform: These days it seems the 
fine-art of “show-biz” is out, 
and transparency is now in. 
No longer do global audiences 
want 
a 
carefully 
cultivated 
celebrity 
persona. 
Instead, 
listeners 
desire 
authenticity, 
vulnerability and truth.
In the past, artists could hide 
behind the shield of a stage-
name, a wig or an eye-catching 
outfit. However, in the digital 
age it is becoming more and more 
difficult for anyone — celebrity 
or regular Joe — to maintain 

privacy. Part of this is a result 
of social media culture, which 
encourages individuals to share 
the minutiae of daily life. On the 
other hand, the ease with which 
information 
is 
shared 
with 
nearly uninhibited accessibility 
also makes it easy for the 
personal lives of high profile 
individuals 
to 
be 
exposed. 
Whether it’s scrutinizing the 
President’s tweets, gossiping 
over voyeuristic tabloid shots or 
analyzing the ups and downs of 
the Kardashian family politics 
via 
Instagram 
“follows,” 
everything is up for grabs.
Now, artists are obligated 
to not only impress the public 
with their performances and 
entertainment 
value, 
but 
also 
uphold 
their 
personal 
reputations. Nothing highlights 
this better than the recent 
string of sexual assault scandals 
which dog the steps of 
some of the most esteemed 
members of the global 
music industry. From R. 
Kelley to the King of Pop 
Michael Jackson, no one 
is exempt from the public 
demand for accountability 
and 
transparency. 
And 
whether you believe the 
allegations against these 
two aforementioned stars 
or not –– and that’s simply 
scraping the surface of 
the disconcerting, dark 
underbelly of the celebrity 
ranks –– the 21st century 
has declared itself to be 
the end of an era where 
fame 
and 
fortune 
are 
enough to impede the 
quest for justice.
That 
is 
not 
to 
say 
that this is the end of 
excitement and creativity 
within 
music. 
Rather, 
the 
music 
industry 
is 
slowly 
shifting 
to 
accommodate 
this 
demand for transparency. The 
artist has reached a new level 
of significance. Not only must 
their music be inspiring and 
original, but the artist themself 
must similarly be an individual 
of good character, moral and 
principle.
This 
is 
the 
so-called 
“renaissance” 
of 
the 
music 
industry. Now, who is making 
the music we consume, and 
how it is being made, is just as 
important (if not more) as the 
art itself.

The music industry, 
however, is changing. The 
public of the 21st century is 
demanding a reform: These 
days it seems the fine-art 
of “show-biz” is out, and 
transparency is now in.

The 
Italian 
Renaissance 
was the birth of Western art 
as it is known today. When 
asked 
to 
think 
of 
“great” 
paintings, minds often conjure 
Leonardo da Vinci’s “Mona 
Lisa,” Michelangelo’s program 
on the ceiling of the Sistine 
Chapel or Sandro Botticelli’s 
“The Birth of Venus.” These 
works 
were 
revolutionary, 
especially compared to the 
Byzantine iconography which 
they succeeded. It brought a 
new emphasis on naturalism 
and 
modeling, 
an 
attempt 
to show nature as it is (or, 
perhaps, as better than it is). 
The Renaissance also saw the 
invention of the one-point — 
or linear — perspective, one of 
the many techniques that made 
their mark on art history. The 
era saw a momentary return 
to the artistic origins of the 
ancients, a re-birth of the 
aptitude for creation found in 
antiquity. 
But 
the 
“Mona 
Lisa” 
is 
more than a pretty picture 
— 
Renaissance 
works 
are 
important to art and society 
today. Art has implications 
and it can be a tool to help 
individuals interface with the 
world.
“The thing about art is that 
it can give us opportunities 
and incentives to look at things 
differently,” History of Art 
Professor 
Thomas 
Willette 
wrote in an email interview 

with The Daily. 
In the Renaissance, art was 
often sacred: as a devotional 
object to aid worship, but more 
importantly as a guidebook. Art 
was a visual depiction of how 
to be a good Catholic; most, if 
not all, art coming from the 
Italian Renaissance was by and 
for Catholics. Art was deeply 
intertwined with religion, and 
thus secular themes in art were 
not well received. Nudity in the 
Sistine Chapel, for instance, 
was seen as so distasteful 
that the church had some of 

Michelangelo’s 
fresco 
work 
painted over after his death. 
The Italian aristocracy was 
dependent on and often a part of 
the church. Even independent 
patronage was often done by 
members of the clergy. 
Recent history has shown 
that religion remains a powerful 
cultural force, guiding politics 

and 
international 
relations. 
Tensions 
in 
Israel 
and 
Palestine, as well as in the Gulf 
and on the Arabian Peninsula 
can all be attributed in part to 
religion. Contemporary art may 
be able to play a mediating role, 
or art historians may look back 
upon today and see religious/
sectarian loyalty in the art of 
our time. “Contemporary art 
is capable of mitigating the 
kinds of political and cultural 
tensions that are, rightly or 
wrongly, justified by claims 
about religious tradition and 

identity. It can do so by showing 
us 
thought 
experiments 
in 
which the spiritual side of 
religion is pried loose from 
the political and cultural hot-
button issues that have become 
opportunistically attached to 
religion,” Willette wrote.
The Renaissance also saw a 
new importance placed on the 

artist. Today, the person behind 
the art matters a great deal. 
Artists like Damien Hirst and 
Jeff Koons are currently active 
and worth fortunes on their 
names alone. Artists as celebrity 
figures are evident in the recent 
past (Warhol, for example), but 
present-day 
artist-celebrities 
are few and far between. The 
large personalities who take a 
business-like approach to art 
(Koons worked on Wall Street 
for a time) crowd the scene and 
may doom the less networking-
savvy artists to the shadows. 
The Italian Renaissance saw an 
increased emphasis on the artist 
themself. In some cases, the 
artist was able to rise through 
social ranks and interact with 
the aristocracy. Jeff Koons may 
be a particularly worthwhile 
case to examine. “Artists in the 
early modern period … earned 
their livings either as clients of 
wealthy patrons or through the 
market,” Willette wrote. “Very 
few rose to the kind of social 
status enjoyed by a Raphael or 
a Michelangelo, who were able 
to work almost like modern-
day contractors. That kind of 
independence requires a lot of 
fame and a lot of connections in 
high places. The vast majority 
of artists were members of 
trade guilds and took orders 
for bespoken work, often never 
meeting the people who paid 
them. The idea that artists were 
highly respected during the 
Renaissance is mostly a myth 
created 
by 
wishful-thinking 
artists and art-lovers in the 19th 
century, 
particularly 
during 
what we call the Romantic 
period. The mass-celebrity and 
wealth that big-name artists 
can command now did not 
exist before the international 
art 
market 
became 
highly 
developed, so that is largely a 
phenomenon of the 19th and 
especially the 20th century.”
One 
key 
Enlightenment 
thinker was Johann Joachim 
Winckelmann. He looked to 
the Greeks as creating art of 
“noble simplicity and quiet 
grandeur.” His focus was on 
art that improved upon nature, 
rather than merely copying it. 
Naturalism was not his ideal, 
but rather idealization of the 
natural forms. This interest in 
the superstructural beauty of 
nature, composed of the ideal 
parts of other forms, calls 
to mind the story of Zeuxis, 
painting Helen of Troy via 
the 
fragmented 
images 
of 
several different models. This 
idealization 
certainly 
has 
implications in terms of self-
image, and these implications 
should not be ignored. The 
other question, however, is in 
this constant self-referentiality. 
Winckelmann looked to the 
Greeks, and myths like the one 

mentioned above. In the same 
manner, 
Bronzino 
referred 
to the Belvedere Torso when 
painting “Portrait of Cosimo I 
de’ Medici as Orpheus” from 
1537 to 1539. Marcel Duchamp 
took an actual print of the 
Mona Lisa and edited it for 

his “L.H.O.O.Q.” in 1919. This 
inspiration from the past is 
common and noteworthy.
Winckelmann looked to the 
Greeks for artistic perfection 
in the same way artists during 
the Italian Renaissance looked 
to antiquity for inspiration 
and subject matter. Today’s 
art refers to antiquity in many 
ways; new revelations about 
once-painted 
marble 
statues 
may change the significance 
of 
antiquities 
themselves. 
“What we are learning about 
the original coloring of ancient 
Greek and Roman statues is 
not entirely new, but various 
technical 
refinements, 
now 
assisted by digital media, have 
made it possible to create 
and 
disseminate 
striking 
hypothetical reconstructions of 
the appearances of such works, 
(I stress hypothetical), and 
many people today seem to like 
the idea. Remember a few years 
back when it became fashionable 
to think that dinosaurs were 
probably brightly colored, like 
today’s birds, and not all dusky 
dark green and brown?” Willete 
wrote. “Fortunately, we have 
a bit more evidence where the 
coloring 
of 
ancient 
marble 
statues 
is 
concerned. 
The 
popular 
traveling 
exhibition 
“Gods in Color: Polychromy 
in 
the 
Ancient 
World” 
is 
probably 
an 
annoyance 
to 
white supremacist groups like 
Identity Evropa, who have been 
recruiting a lot of statuary to 
their cause in recent years, 
but I can’t agree with those 
who think that taking the 
white stone men away from 
white supremacists is the main 
reason to get excited about the 
investigation of polychromy in 
antiquity. Besides, no amount 
of color and vivid patterning 
can change the fact that most 

people living in ancient Greece 
or ancient Rome were slaves.”
The proliferation of art in 
the Renaissance would not have 
occurred without institutional 
and individual patronage. The 
Catholic 
church, 
clergymen 
and wealthy families like the 
Medici clan spent immense 
amounts of money on art, 
sculpture 
and 
architecture. 
Art was a status symbol, as it 
remains in some regard today. 
The work of artists who have 
been inducted to the canon of 
Western art is worth millions. 
Supporting 
artists 
— 
in 
contemporary times and in the 
recent — is a difficult task. The 
starving artist trope is not a lie. 
In Enlightenment-era France, 
as well as in Renaissance Italy, 
the state was a huge provider 
of arts patronage. While the 
United States has the National 
Endowment 
for 
the 
Arts, 
patronage is not given the same 
importance. This has its pros 
and cons. While the state has 
no say in what contemporary 
art is, it does leave important 
projects 
with 
cultural 
and 
societal significance unfunded. 
“The 
U.S. 
government 
can 
become a significant patron 
of art, perhaps even on a par 
with the court of Louis XIV, 
but many changes in our ruling 
culture and institutions will 
have to start coming about, 
and I don’t see any evidence of 
that at the moment. The Works 
Progress Administration was 
a highly successful New Deal 
agency, and it did a lot of good 
without any help from the art 
market, but that was the 1930s 
and early ’40s, when many 
people evidently believed that 
1) the imaginative experience 
of art can help to make one a 
better person, and 2) the state is 
capable of assisting our better 
angels. Neither of these ideas 
seems to have much credibility 
today,” Willette wrote on the 
issue. 
The 
Italian 
Renaissance 
continues 
to 
offer 
valuable 
lessons 
to 
this 
day. 
The 
revolutionary nature of art is 
not constant, and the evolution 
of contemporary art is fluid 
and enigmatic. To gain better 
insight into contemporary art, 
and the interaction of art with 
society today, it is beneficial to 
understand the roots of Western 
art and note the differences 
between 15th century Italy, 
18th century France and 21st 
century America. Art is always 
in a renaissance. Stagnancy 
recoils at the sight of the artist. 
There will always be something 
new in art, and it is worthwhile 
to understand the past to better 
understand self-referentiality, 
new impacts of old themes 
and the role of the artist in 
contemporary society.

Contemporary visual art 
and the Italian Renaissance

ROSS ORGIEFSKY

B-SIDE SECONDARY

When 
fashion 
designer 
Gianni Versace was murdered 
outside 
of 
his 
luxurious 
mansion 
in 
Miami 
Beach, 
Florida, the devastated fashion 
world 
assumed 
the 
iconic 
brand was dead. With the 
house’s fearless leader gone at 
a mere 50 years, designers and 
style connoisseurs alike were 

prepared to leave his brand in 
the dust. After all, in fashion, 
one day you’re in, as for the 
next day … well you know the 
rest.
The atelier was in shock. 
His death came before the 
knockout that was the Versace 
Ready-to-Wear 
collection 
at Milan Fashion Week in 
1991, where model icons like 
Naomi Campbell and Cindy 
Crawford 
walked 
down 
the runway as a force to be 
reckoned with, singing along 

to George Michael’s ‘Freedom’, 
all sporting bold colors and 
silhouettes: a style that can 
only be associated with the 
work of Gianni Versace.
It seemed artistic moments 
like 
this 
were 
no 
longer 
going to be a product of the 
renowned brand. Yet, how is 
it that today, in 2019, Versace 
is just as integral as it was 
in 
the 
’90s? 
The 
answer: 
Versace never really died. The 
iconic namesake was never 
tarnished, in fact the entire 

house completely embodies the 
renaissance: In every corner of 
the Versace legacy from the 
evolution of Donatella Versace 
to the overall aesthetic of the 
brand’s recognizable pattern, 
color and silhouettes, Versace 
essentially started the trend of 
rebirth.
Model 
powerhouses 
like 
Gigi 
Hadid 
and 
Shalom 
Harlow regularly walk the 
Versace runway, and they do so 
proudly. Although the loss of 
fashion genius Gianni Versace 
was a setback, instead of 
giving up and abandoning what 
remained of Versace’s legacy, 
the entire atelier used this 
loss and change to completely 
revolutionize the brand, the 
center of this revolution being 
Donatella Versace.
Initially the muse for the 
company, Donatella Versace 
was her brother’s main source 
of inspiration. At the time of 
her brother’s death she was not 
completely involved with the 
designing of the luxury items, 
but rather the Versace poster 
child. But it is her shift in roles 
that completely defines Versace 
as the renaissance. Donatella 
Versace took what she knew 
about the company’s tradition 
and maintained it, embracing 
the changes and rebirth that 
came with her face as the new 
brand of the company. Ads for 
the company’s 2019 collections 
embrace the concept of change 
and breaking from tradition.
In an interview with The 
New 
York 
Times, 
Versace 
explains the pressure she felt 
to keep Versace relevant after 
her brothers passing and how 
to ensure their customers the 

brand would survive. In reality, 
instead of hiding behind the 
death of her brother, Versace 
pushed the brand further. “I 
like branding, all the time. 
It’s what I do,” said Versace. 
Where she could have stepped 
down, Donatella Versace gave 
customers and designers no 
excuses 
not 
to 
remember 
the 
Versace 
name, 
playing 
with 
patterns 
and 
layers 
so bold, one has no choice 
not to stop and remember a 
Versace design or textile. To 
this day, Donatella Versace 
is revamping what her late 
brother created, redesigning 
the iconic leather strap for 
the dress she wore in 1994 — 
undoubtedly remembered as 
one of the most iconic pieces 
of its time — for the 2019 
Fall/Winter 
collection. 
In 
2017, she even nodded to the 
aforementioned 
1991 
Milan 
show, paying tribute to iconic 
Gianni Versace by inviting 
models from the 1991 show 
to walk the runway in classic 
Versace 
prints, 
including 
butterflies and Vogue covers.
So, while Gianni’s Versace 
textiles have always visually 
and aesthetically embodied the 
renaissance — never straying 
from the boldest of patterns 
or layering — making even 
those most unfamiliar with 
fashion recognize a Versace 
print or silhouette, the true 
embodiment of the renaissance 
lies in the strategy of branding 
that Donatella Versace has 
focused in on so clearly that, 22 
years later, the Versace atelier 
is still the key to luxury and 
extravagance in fashion and 
style. In today’s fashion world, 

consumers and designers are 
constantly encouraged to purge 
their fashion palettes, clearing 
room in closets and on sewing 
tables for new pieces and 
collections. Versace could have 
easily taken the traditional 
route, dividing the work of her 
brother Gianni from what she 
would create after his death. 
She could have completely 
rebranded the Versace atelier, 
but she chose to make her 
company even more bold and 
unforgettable, a strategy that 
has in turn branded Versace as 
one of the most consistent and 
powerful fashion houses in the 
industry.
When the phrase renaissance 
in fashion comes to mind, I 
would argue Versace’s oriental 
prints are the exact visual 
depiction of this era, the word 
change a close second thought. 
Yet Donatella Versace’s own 
renaissance 
involved 
little 
change, rather a focus on 
the existing, a choice that 
completely 
revolutionized 
fashion, a world where we are 
constantly ready to consume 
something new in order to 
abandon the old. The rebirth 
of Versace under Donatella’s 
name 
did 
not 
require 
completely going back to the 
drawing board for an entirely 
new 
aesthetic, 
and, 
lucky 
for the fashion world, a new 
wave of Versace was never 
born. There were just constant 
reminders of the Versace name 
and focus on expanding the 
existing, pushing for something 
even bolder. A telltale that 
consistency can, against all 
odds, activate change: A true, 
modern renaissance.

Detroit: A sustainable city 
is not a segregated one

MAX KUANG / DAILY

BEN VASSAR
Daily Arts Writer

B-SIDE LEAD

We rarely agree on what 
exactly gentrification means. 
To some, it merely suggests the 
improvement of a neighborhood. 
To others, the word inherently 
implies displacement. It could 
also suggest the forced removal 
of 
lower 
income 
peoples 
from a neighborhood due to 
economic push factors brought 
on by middle class investment. 
But 
is 
it 
gentrification 
if 
there’s improvement with no 
displacement? Can only poorer 
neighborhoods 
be 
subject 
to gentrification? And, most 
importantly, is gentrification 
really so bad after all for cities 
like Detroit?
In a phone interview with 
The Daily, Joel Stone, a senior 
curator at the Detroit Historical 
Society, 
said 
“The 
word 
gentrification has a negative 
connotation.” Though the word 
itself was only popularized in 
the ’70s, it seemed to me that 
many people’s perceptions of 
the word was no different from 
what people before the ’70s 
would have merely described 
as “development.” But this isn’t 
all gentrification is. Since its 
introduction into mainstream 
media, 
“gentrification” 
has 
always 
carried 
racist 
and 
classist 
undertones 
that 
“development” doesn’t.
“Historically, 
there 
have 
always 
been 
lower 
income 
people in places around the 
city that have been displaced,” 
Stone 
said. 
This 
shouldn’t 
come as a surprise. One such 
example of this is the Brush 
Park 
neighborhood. 
Now 
part 
of 
Detroit’s 
midtown, 
Brush Park was once entirely 
farmlands. 
Under 
pressure 
from developers, these farmers 
were forced to sell their land 
and move further out from the 
city center. This feels different 
from what we would consider 
gentrification today, though. 
White farmers moving out to 
what we now accept as the 
suburbs to make way for the 
city to grow? Isn’t this how all 
American cities came about?
Stone then cited a photo 
in 
the 
Detroit 
Historical 
Museum’s collection of the 
General Motors building going 
up alongside tenement houses 
in the 1920s. In a neighborhood 

once considered on the wrong 
side of the tracks, GM single-
handedly redefined a new city 
center (called “New Center”) 
over the course of the next few 
decades.
“Did that improve the area? 
It did. Did it make that part of 
Detroit’s history? Absolutely. 
Did they remove lower income 
people? Absolutely,” Stone said.
What differentiates Detroit’s 
current gentrification and the 
Brush Park case? In the Brush 
Park 
example, 
low-density 
land on the edge of a booming 
city was replaced with new, 
medium-density 
housing. 
People 
were 
displaced 
and 
emotional damage was surely 
done, but less so than in the 
higher-density 
displacement 
of the residents of the New 
Center. Wasn’t the medium-
density housing there already 
comprising 
a 
viable 
city 
neighborhood? 
What 
right 
did GM have to displace these 
lower-income 
immigrant 
families from the city they were 
trying to make succeed in? 
“I suppose there are people 
who would argue, ‘Were they 
(the neighborhoods) viable? Or 
were they barely surviving?’ 
In which case the influx of 
new 
renters, 
renters 
with 
more money may be raising 
the viability standard,” Stone 
said, describing both historical 
and present-day examples of 
gentrification. This is the issue 
at hand in Detroit. In a city 
where the poverty rate differs 
significantly between the city’s 
core 
and 
the 
metropolitan 
area as a whole — 36 percent 
and 15 percent respectively — 
isn’t middle class investment 
a welcome change? Not if it 
creates a city blatantly divided 
by race, and certainly not if it 
forces minority families that 
have been sustaining the city 
for almost a century now to 
move out all together.
To 
discuss 
the 
more 
personal effects of poverty 
and gentrification in Detroit, 
I spoke with Otiyah Ross-
Chapman, youth and young 
adult 
ministry 
chairperson 
at the Conant Avenue United 
Methodist Church in Conant 
Gardens, 
Detroit. 
Ross-
Chapman said she’s yet to see 
any examples of gentrification 
in the neighborhood, which 
is located just south of 7 Mile 

Road. What she does see, 
however, is the struggle many 
neighborhood 
residents 
go 
through to put food on the 
table on a regular basis. At a 
local level, she believes that 
anchoring neighbors in the 
church and investing in youth 
are the two ways to deter gang 
violence and elevate residents 
to a higher ground than they 
currently stand on.
“If you reach out to the 
children, then eventually you’ll 
get their parents. We have 
programs that allow children to 
come off the street, like the arts 

program allows for the children 
to come off the street rather 
than run to the gangs so they 
can come and work on their 
art. And we have a summer 
program for when they’re out 
of school and they’re hungry. 
It’s called a ‘meet up and eat 
up’ program … and that allows 
for them to come out and get 
something to eat and allows 
for them to learn academically 
as well as have social skills,” 
Ross-Chapman said.
There 
are 
also 
other 
programs 
the 
church 
is 
involved in.
“We have a youth program 
where we do dance, step and 
choir. So that allows them to 
get in touch with their musical 
side, if they love to sing or if 
they love to drop beats, you 
know, whatever. And they can 
live you know, not live the 
lifestyle they’re living now 
because eventually we want 
them to do better. He changed 
their hearts, and made them 
into better citizens,” Ross-
Chapman said.
Local 
change 
like 
this 
seems to contrast with the 
public’s visions of Detroit’s 
revitalization. 
Quicken 
Loans founder Dan Gilbert’s 
investment 
in 
Detroit’s 

downtown 
since 
2010 
— 
which involves $5.6 billion 
spent across over about 100 
properties and the employment 
of 17,000 people — has led to 
unprecedented growth in the 
Woodward 
Avenue 
area 
of 
downtown. But it’s unclear just 
how much of this investment 
is 
reaching 
neighborhoods 
beyond downtown.
According to an editorial 
in 
The 
Detroit 
News, 
“In 
2000, there were over 100,000 
African American families in 
Detroit who earned $40,000 or 
more. In 2016, after adjusting 
for 
inflation, 
there 
were 
only 44,000.” This makes a 
difference in a city where 79 
percent of the population is 
African American, according to 
the 2010 U.S. Census (and even 
more so in Conant Gardens, 
where 93 percent of residents 
identify as such). And it doesn’t 
seem that Gilbert’s investment 
is 
helping. 
According 
to 
City Lab, jobs for Detroiters 
decreased from 46,309 in 2007 
to 29,875 in 2014, while jobs for 
non-Detroiters increased from 
75,000 to 88,000 over that same 
period. This reflects a general 
trend of educated, middle-class 
people 
moving 
to 
Detroit’s 
suburbs for higher standards 
of living, and the resultant 
drainage of cash flow from the 
inner city.
While 
the 
greater 
trend 
has 
been 
towards 
this 
suburbanization, contemporary 
examples 
of 
gentrification 
and 
inner-city 
development 
do exist. Joel Stone cites the 
development of Cass Corridor, 
Corktown, 
Woodbridge 
and 
several others as examples of 
places where the stabilization 
of 
downtown 
has 
pushed 
development 
beyond 
its 
borders.

When 
I 
asked 
if 
 
the 
commercial 
activity 
that’s 
happening 
downtown 
and 
along Woodward spilled out 
into the adjacent communities 
at all, Stone replied yes. 
“I would say now that the 
downtown has been stabilized, 
it’s encouraging entrepreneurs 
to invest in those ancillary 

neighborhoods. 
In 
other 
words, if somebody invests 
in a beautiful building on 
Woodward or in a historic 
building on Cass, it encourages 
people to invest in the building 
next to and around it, and, you 
know, they’re putting up new 
buildings where there weren’t, 
where 
there 
were 
parking 
lots. Now there are brand new 
apartment buildings, and once 
you get those in and it stabilizes 
the block or stabilizes three or 
four blocks, that encourages 
people to invest their time, 
their effort, their money in the 
blocks adjacent to that. It’s kind 
of a ripple effect. So maybe the 
folks who lived on Cass have 
been able to find housing three 
or four blocks further away, 
but that also means in another 
four or five years, assuming we 
remain on the same trajectory, 
that they may be looking for 
new housing in another five or 
ten years,” Stone said.
If 
a 
block 
does 
become 
revitalized 
and 
‘stabilized’, 
a lot of people may point to 
the fact that it doesn’t take 
going very far in Detroit to 
find new housing. It only 
takes a few blocks just because 
that downtown area is so 
concentrated, and Stone agrees. 
“There 
were 
parts 
of 
Brooklyn 
that 
got 
so 
run 
down that they probably had a 
similar (situation), but theirs 
has 
happened 
faster, 
and 
now so much of Brooklyn is 
taken up you can’t say that’s 
the possibility … in Detroit I 
noticed they just opened the 
Saint Regis building, which 
is great. That was a gorgeous, 
gorgeous building, it needed 
help … and, if you used to live 
in Saint Regis or in a building 
near there, you probably only 
have to go a few blocks to find 
a place that has a rent that you 
can afford,” Stone said.
It may be happening more 
slowly than in other cities, but 
surely, Detroit’s downtown is 
gentrifying. And not all of the 
city’s talent is moving out either. 
According to Alan Mallach, 
“Since 2010, Detroit has seen an 
increase of 8,000 in the number 
of people 25 to 34 with a college 
degree living in the city. That’s 
a 
change 
after 
the 
steady 
decline of this group up to 
2010, but it’s small compared to 
Pittsburgh (15,000), Baltimore 
(24,000), Philadelphia (44,000) 
and many other cities.” Alan 
Mallach is the author of “The 
Divided 
City: 
Poverty 
and 
Prosperity in Urban America” 
and a senior fellow at the Center 
for Community Progress in 
Washington, D.C.
In 
accordance 
with 
Joel 

Stone’s analysis, Mallach’s book 
also points to Cass Corridor, 
Corktown, 
Woodbridge 
and 
Downtown 
as 
the 
neighborhoods where poorer 
people are being supplanted 
by higher rents the most. 
Additionally, 
supporting 
Stone’s ripple effect theory, 
Mallach claims that “future 
gentrification 
elsewhere 
is 
likely 
to 
be 
slow 
and 
incremental, affecting mainly 
blocks right next to the ones 
that are already gentrified.”
So where does this leave 
neighborhoods 
like 
Conant 
Gardens? The slow, incremental 
crawl of development from 
downtown 
seems 
incredibly 
distant from the urban farms, 
vacant lots and boarded up 
homes 
that 
now 
comprise 
Detroit’s 
former 
working-
class 
and 
middle-class 
neighborhoods. The aims of 
Gilbert, founder of a mortgage 
lending company, seem even 
more distant. This is all in great 
contrast to the “blank slate” 
idea of Detroit that the media 
paints. Yes, there are $5,000 
homes in Detroit. No, they don’t 
seem likely to be developed any 
time soon.
Even 
if 
development 
continued at its current rate 
for another few decades, it 
would make two cities: One 
Black and one white. In order 
to form a sustainable city 
economy, Detroiters — and that 
means the majority African 
American families that have 
been sustaining the city for 
decades — would need to gain 
an additional 100,000 jobs on 
top of the supposed 30,000 to 
40,000 they currently hold, 
according to Laura A. Reece, 
professor of political science 
and director of the Global 
Urban 
Studies 
Program 
at 
Michigan State University.
It’s 
unclear 
whether 
the 
development 
of 
downtown 
would ever be able to spur a 
turnaround like this. Public 
investment in education and 
career development has failed 
in the past, and who’s to say 
this where the money would go? 
The ball is in Gilbert’s court. 
Detroit’s Black middle class 
needs to come back, and it’s 
anchor people like Otiyah Ross-
Chapman 
that 
are 
fighting 
for this. We can’t sit back and 
act like Detroit’s coming back 
when it’s not coming back for 
everyone. A sustainable city is 
not a segregated one. While the 
city’s downtown comes back 
and public funds accumulate, 
Detroit’s poorer communities 
need leaders to propel the 
next generation toward a more 
equitable future.

SINGLE REVIEW: ‘BANDANA’

Freddie Gibbs and Madlib 
have been hip hop’s most 
iconic 
contemporary 
duo 
since Piñata released almost 
five years ago (and has aged 
like a fine wine since then). 
In 2016, Madlib announced a 
follow-up, Bandana, with little 
information other than that it 
would feature rejected beats 
from Kanye West’s The Life of 
Pablo. The only thing fans have 
had to go on since then has been 
cryptic Instagram pictures of 
Gibbs and Madlib in the studio. 
Finally, the album rollout has 
begun: Bandana’s debut single 
“Flat Tummy Tea” dropped 
in February. On Mar. 5, the 
duo dropped the titular single 
“Bandana” featuring Jamaican 
dancehall artist Assassin.
The continuity in sound 
between 
Piñata 
and 
its 
upcoming successor is clear 
right from the beginning of 

“Bandana,” with trademark-
Madlib drums that echo Piñata’s 
opening track, “Supplier.” An 
eerie vocal sample and ghostly 
sound effects are layered over 
a spacey pad, making for a beat 
that conjures images of an alien 
invasion. Gibbs delivers his 
verse with fiery, painting a grim 

picture of his gang-affiliated 
days slinging crack in Gary, 
Indiana. Gibbs’s lyrics are dense, 
filled with metaphors and slang 
that mirror the complexity of 
Madlib’s production.
Assassin, best known (outside 
of Jamaica) for his features on 

Kanye West’s “I’m In It” and 
Kendrick Lamar’s “The Blacker 
the Berry,” is a phenomenal 
guest: His ad-libs and reverbing 
backup vocals bring a menacing 
mood to the track, and his 
Jamaican-slang-filled 
verse 
carries over the energy from 
Gibbs’s.
“Bandana,” simply put, goes 
hard. The moody instrumental 
and 
direct 
lyrics 
(“I 
ain’t 
bullshittin’,” as Gibbs says) are 
uncharacteristic of a single: 
They make for what sounds like 
a deep-album cut, something 
that will sound even better in the 
context of the whole record. If 
“Bandana” is any indicator, the 
eponymous album will be well 
worth the long wait.
