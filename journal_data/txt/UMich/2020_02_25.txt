LSA junior Stephen Dinka arrived 
at 
the 
Shapiro 
Undergraduate 
Library basement hoping to receive 
help with his Foundations of 
Computer Science course, EECS 376, 
homework at office hours. However, 
even though he arrived early, Dinka 
saw a massive crowd of students 
waiting for the instructional aide.
“That one particular day was 
ridiculous,” Dinka said. “There were 
people standing around, right at the 
front door wondering, ‘Where’s the 
IA?’ When the IA finally showed 

up, you have all these people just 
standing, and there’s no room. 
They literally go across the entire 
basement and take all these chairs 
just to sit around this one guy with a 
tiny whiteboard.”
Students 
told 
The 
Daily 
overcrowding in the UGLi is a 
familiar issue for many students 
of theory-based computer science 
classes. IAs interviewed by The 
Daily said they do not want to be a 
nuisance in public spaces, but they 
need to use them because they do 
not have an official area to host office 
hours. Unlike professors, they do not 
have offices or designated spaces to 

meet.
Engineering sophomore Ryan 
Baker said he tends to arrive early to 
office hours, which IAs hold in the 
UGLi, but has also been in positions 
where he wasn’t early enough and 
there was not enough room in 
the UGLi to accommodate all the 
students who need help.
“I’ve been in positions where 
there are so many people in that 
small space that the IA is trying to 
utilize that you can’t see what he’s 
writing or you can’t hear him at all,” 
Baker said. “It’s just kind of pointless 
going to office hours at that point 
because you can’t get the help you 

need.”
According 
to 
Engineering 
junior Ian Robinson, an EECS 
376 IA, the overcrowding issue 
became 
exacerbated 
once 
the 
class was informally kicked 
out of the UGLi basement. 
For his specific office hours, 
Robinson moved to the Design 
Lab of the UGLi. Even after 
moving, he was still unable to 
fit all the students who needed 
help but had no other options 
as he does not have an office 
on campus.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

The University of Michigan 
International 
Institute 
presented the Conference on 
Migration, attended by about 
50 members of the University 
community, 
on 
Monday 
at 
Weiser Hall. The conference 
consisted of interdisciplinary 
dialogue driven by presentations 
from local and international 

scholars. 
Topics covered include the 
migration of ideas and languages, 
causes and effects of migration, 
the socio-political implications 
of human movement, culture 
production and transferral and 
countering common narratives 
about migration. 
Alyssa Park, professor of 
modern 
Korean 
history 
at 
the University of Iowa, gave a 
talk explaining the history of 

Korean and Chinese migration 
near the Russian border and 
how the rules and norms of 
migration changed over time. 
Due to a lack of land and natural 
disasters such as flooding in 
Korea in the 19th century, Park 
said Korean migrants moved in 
waves to Russia, particularly to 
Vladivostok province. 
“The region (of Vladivostok 
was) newly acquired by Russia, 
not many Russians there,” Park 

said. “So they make do with the 
people who are closest and these 
would be Chinese and Koreans … 
and Vladivostok becomes a hub 
for these people.”
Park also talked about Russia 
then claiming that the Korean 
immigrants 
were 
Russian 
“subjects,” 
the 
equivalent 
of 
modern-day 
citizens.

Approximately 
50 
students, 
faculty and community members 
gathered 
in 
the 
Rackham 
Assembly Hall on Monday evening 
to 
attend 
“Gender 
Violence, 
Immigrant Vulnerability and the 
State: A Symposium.” The event 
was designed to educate students 
and the community about how 
increased 
globalization 
and 
migration is affecting how society 
views immigrants in the post-
colonial world. 
Debotri Dhar, women’s studies 
professor at the University of 
Michigan, organized the event 
along with other speakers. 
According to Dhar, residual 
ideals from the colonial era have 
resulted in immigrants of color 
being framed as burdens on 
the state in order to maintain 
hierarchies of race, social class 
and nation present in the colonial 
era. She said this also contributes 
to 
the 
relationship 
between 
immigrant 
vulnerability 
and 
gender violence in today’s post-
colonial era.
“This 
current 
moment 
in 
history is very politically divisive, 
not just for the nation but globally,” 
Dhar said.

The 
event 
titled, “To Solve Drug Pricing 
We Must Solve the Drug Patent 
Problem,” was a part of the 
Science, Technology and Public 
Policy speaker series at the Public 
Policy School. There were about 
30 people in attendance Monday 
evening.
 Krishtel began to discuss her 
work as an advocate for drug 
patent reform. Throughout her 
career, Krishtel has worked with 
many global organizations and 
agencies such as the Indian NGO 
Lawyers Collective.
 She gave a brief history of 
India’s patent system and spoke 
about how high prescription drug 
prices impacted the community. 
 “The common service we had 
to provide for clients was to draw 
up adoption and documentation 
papers. This was because parents 
knew that they were going to pass 
away and they needed to make 
sure their children were cared 
for,” Krishtel said.

MI officials 
look ahead
to primary 
election day

The Iowa caucuses have 
kicked off every presidential 
primary election race since 
1972 and serve to narrow down 
the field of candidates in each 
political party. However, what 
ensued during this year’s Iowa 
caucus left both the importance 
and credibility of the historic 
event in question ahead of 
the remaining caucuses and 
primaries. It ultimately took 
party officials 15 days to get 
100 percent of the votes in, 
with candidates Pete Buttigieg 
and Sen. Bernie, D-Vt., Sanders 
determined as the winners. 
There 
were 
issues 
downloading a new app the 
Iowa Democratic Party rolled 
out, with only 439 people 
ultimately 
submitting 
their 
votes through the app out of 
1,765 precincts. 
The mishaps of the Iowa 
caucus 
left 
many 
voters 
discouraged. LSA senior Jessica 
Kosticak, 
co-president 
for 
Students for Pete, was in Iowa 
as the caucus results unfolded. 
“It was an interesting sight 
to behold. It was just wild,” 
Kosticak 
said. 
“As 
I 
was 

traveling back to Michigan the 
day after (the Iowa caucus), my 
road trip partner was reading 
me poll results and as some of 
the precinct results started 
coming in, I was like, ‘Okay, 
but is it real?’ There was a lot 
of skepticism in person and 
online. There still continues to 
be, I think rightfully so.”
The Michigan primary on 
March 10 is a key moment, 
since the state is considered a 
battleground state in the 2020 
election. Donald Trump won in 
Michigan by over 10,000 votes 
in 2016 where, in previous 
elections, the state had voted 
Democratic, 
and 
since 
has 
voted in a Democratic governor. 
While 
acknowledging 
the 
mishaps 
of 
the 
Iowa 
caucus, Jake Rollow, director 
of 
communications 
at 
the 
Michigan Department of State, 
highlighted 
the 
differences 
between the way each state 
runs their primary elections. 
“I always use the apples to 
oranges 
comparison. 
Iowa’s 
run by caucuses, ours aren’t 
caucuses, they’re primaries,” 
Rollow said.

PALMER COMMONS
FORUM HALL

A public lecture and reception.
For information please call (734) 615-6667.

More than 40 University 
of Michigan students, faculty 
and residents of Ann Arbor 
gathered 
in 
the 
Eldersveld 
Room of Haven Hall on Monday 
afternoon to listen to a panel 
on 
the 
19th 
Amendment’s 
legacy 
and 
its 
current 
implications. The panel was a 
part of the #UMSuffrage2020 

speaker series in honor of 
the 
amendment’s 
100th 
anniversary. 
 
Christina 
Wolbrecht, 
a 
professor of political science 
at Notre Dame University and 
director of the Rooney Center 
for the Study of American 
Democracy, 
spoke 
about 
common views among female 
voters over the past century. 
Wolbrecht especially focused 
on the connection between the 

voting choices of husbands and 
their wives since the time of the 
amendment. 
 According to Wolbrecht, 
while the voting patterns of 
husbands 
and 
wives 
often 
imitate each other, the voting 
actions of the husband may not 
directly impact the political 
opinions 
of 
his 
wife. 
Her 
research has found it is likely 
a woman’s tendency to speak 
about politics frequently within 
her 
family 
and 
community 
causes 
her 
opinions 
to 
be 
shaped by others, but it is not 
necessarily 
an 
intentional 
action on behalf of her husband 
or her community.
 “Is it possible that men were 
telling their wives how to vote, 
and some of them were voting 
on that basis?” Wolbrecht said. 
“Absolutely. It’s probably even 
likely. We just don’t have a very 
good sense within this data 
about how likely that was.” 
Corrine McConnaughy, an 
associate professor of political 
science at George Washington 
University, 
continued 
with 
her research on the number 
of women’s groups who were 
politically active before the 
19th Amendment. She drew 
examples from history, such 
as 
a 
church 
sewing 
group 
becoming politically active by 
working towards goals such as 
purchasing and building a city 
graveyard. 
According to McConnaughy, 
the question of why political 
organizations 
would 
want 
to have women working for 
them was answered by two 
words: labor and money. She 
said women were extremely 
interested in advancing their 
communities and were willing 
to work hard for it. Additionally, 
McConnaughy 
said 
women 
often helped fundraise through 

organizing. 
 
“Women 
doing 
politics 
might 
look 
different 
than 
men doing politics but that 
doesn’t need to translate into 
women doing women’s politics.” 
McConnaughy said.
 Before the meeting closed, 
Mara 
Cecilia 
Ostfeld, 
an 
assistant professor of political 
science 
at 
the 
University, 
presented the findings of her 
project in progress focusing on 
the effect of family socialization 
on voting habits and opinions. 
Her 
research 
is 
currently 
focused on why many women 
vote against policies that benefit 
women as a whole. 
 Ostfeld said her research 
shows 
that 
regardless 
of 
whether one believes in an issue, 
people still tend to bend to what 
they anticipate would evoke the 
best response from their family 
members. 
 
“Perceiving 
your 
family 
would 
stigmatize 
you 
for 
supporting these issues is a 
really strong predictor of your 
own likelihood of supporting 
these issues,” Ostfeld said. 
Rackham 
student 
Zoe 
Walker said she was especially 
interested in hearing from the 
researchers and the extent to 
which topics regarding women 
in politics are studied. 
 “There’s a lot of diversity 
in the study of women and 
politics,” Walker said. “There 
are 
historical 
perspectives, 
New 
Age 
perspectives, 
and 
they’re shaping the ways women 
organize and the way in which 
women 
think 
and 
behave 
politically. I think it’s really 
important to think about how 
complicated and interesting the 
study of women is.”

 “They are run by the party, 
ours are not, ours are run by 
experienced 
election 
officials 
to carry out elections, typically 
every year if not every two years. 
And we’re not using untested 
technology. We’re not expecting 
a 
similar 
scenario 
to 
what 
occurred in Iowa.” 
The Michigan primary differs 
greatly from the Iowa caucuses. 
Instead of going to a corner of the 
room to vote for your candidate, 
voters go to their local precinct 
and cast a ballot for whichever 
candidate they support. Voters 
in the Michigan primary are 
also able to vote with absentee 
ballots, allowing for more voters 
to take part in the election.
In 2018, a law passed in the 
Michigan 
state 
legislature 
granting the right for any eligible 
voter to vote by absentee ballot 
regardless of reasoning. As of 
Feb. 18, over 666,000 absentee 
ballots had been distributed, 

with a projected number of over 
850,000 to be distributed by the 
primary date. 
LSA 
freshman 
Andrew 
Schaeffler, co-founder of the 
University’s chapter of Students 
for Biden, expressed his concerns 
about absentee ballots. 
“I think that the absentee 
ballots are definitely going to 
be the thing in the Michigan 
primary,” Schaeffler said. “That 
if we were to have any problem 
that’s even similar to Iowa but in 
the same context of that.” 
The uptick in absentee ballots 
has also caused a shift in how 
presidential 
candidates 
have 
campaigned in Michigan. Trump 
and many Democratic front-
runners have focused on trying 
to rally early votes by setting up 
campaign offices, phone banking, 
door-knocking and other tactics.
Schaeffler 
said 
former 
Vice President Joe Biden, a 
Democratic front-runner in the 
2020 election, is trying to rally 
the early absentee ballot voters. 
“I think the Biden campaign 
is effectively beginning and 

implementing 
a 
campaign 
strategy in Michigan, focusing 
on reaching out to voters with 
their absentee ballots currently,” 
Shaeffler said. “Making these 
initial connections has been 
integral. Our club, in conjunction 
with Biden volunteers, have 
made thousands of calls to 
Michiganders and folks in other 
states, 
making 
direct 
voter 
contact.”
Other political student groups 
like Students for Warren, College 
Republicans and Students for 
Bernie did not reply to requests 
for comment. 
While an increased number 
of voters for the primary isn’t 
expected, the rise in absentee 
ballots is projected to put more 
of a burden on clerks across the 
state. Since clerks aren’t allowed 
to start collecting results until 7 
a.m. on the day of the primary, 
many 
clerks 
said 
they 
are 
worried about not getting the 
results in quickly enough. 
Jacqueline Beaudry, a city 
clerk in Ann Arbor, spoke to 
The Daily about how the city 

is dealing with the influx of 
absentee ballots.
“We have actually doubled 
the number of counting boards 
for this election compared to the 
March 2016 (election),” Beaudry 
said. “So we are obviously in 
support, moving into November, 
of any reforms that would allow 
us to start processing earlier or 
to extend the time to process 
ballots. But, in terms of March, 
we’ve doubled our workforce 
and our number of tabulators to 
count the ballots.”
Though Ann Arbor is just 
one city that has hired more 
workers to deal with the influx 
of absentee ballots this year, the 
state is working to make sure all 
precincts can efficiently count 
the ballots in a timely manner, 
Rollow said. 
“Our goal is to count all 
ballots accurately and to provide 
results,” Rollow said. “We’re 
working 
with 
clerks 
across 
the state to help them have 
the resources they need to do 
their job. We’ve also called on 
the legislature to request they 

be allowed to at least start 
processing absentee ballots prior 
to the Election Day.” 
LSA junior Carolyn Chen, field 
organizer for the University of 
Michigan’s chapter of College 
Democrats, is responsible for 
getting people registered to vote. 
Chen said waiting for results is 
acceptable if it means greater 
accuracy in the vote calculations. 
“I don’t think it was a huge 
deal that people had to wait for 
the results. If that’s gonna get 
you an accurate answer, then 
just wait it out,” Chen said. “I 
feel like I don’t go into elections 
expecting 
everything 
to 
go 
perfectly anyway.” 
Logan 
Woods, 
Rackham 
student and secretary for Turnup 
Turnout, 
an 
organization 
dedicated to getting students 
registered to vote, spoke about 
the importance of making sure 
all elections are secure, no matter 
if it’s a primary or a caucus. 
“The 
benefit 
of 
(having 
primaries and caucuses) within 
states is that states, counties or 
towns and cities, can tailor their 

elections to what works best 
for their community,” Woods 
said. “The election system’s 
commissioner is bipartisan. I 
know that within states, all of the 
local election officials that I’ve 
spoken with, regardless of their 
party, have been professional and 
helpful, and they want elections 
to run smoothly. They want votes 
and voting machines to be secure 
and to work properly.”
With the primary coming up 
in 16 days, voters and election 
officials alike are continuing to 
prepare to make the primary day 
run smoothly and efficiently. 
“We’ve 
done 
numerous 
things to ensure that our 
elections are safe,” Rollow said. 
“And we do that because of the 
importance of elections and 
also because we want voters 
to feel what they should feel, 
which is absolute confidence 
that their voice matters and 
their vote will be counted.”

OFFICE HOURS 
From Page 1

“While we weren’t kicked 
out, we did sort of have 
this 
overcrowding 
issue 
because my office hours were 
coincidentally at the same 
time as another EECS 203 IA’s 
(office hours),” Robinson said. 
“We were sharing this really 
small space that was barely 
enough for a single office 
hour, and there were so many 
students there that we were 
told we posed a fire hazard.” 
On Feb. 5, a week after they 
had made the change from the 
basement to the Design Lab, 
Robinson was pulled aside by 
UGLi staff during his office 
hours. 
“When I was giving office 
hours, UGLi staff took me away 
and told me that basically I 
was getting kicked out of the 
UGLi,” Robinson said. “They 
showed me the printed copy of 
the email that had supposedly 
been sent out to the EECS 
department.”
A copy of the email was 
provided to The Daily by 
Stephen 
Griffes, 
senior 
manager in library operations. 
Griffes sent the email to Brian 
Noble, 
chair 
of 
Computer 
Science 
and 
Engineering; 
Seth Pettie, associate chair 
and professor of Electrical 
Engineering 
and 
Computer 
Science; Mingyan Liu, Peter

and

Engineering; 
and 
Dennis 
Sylvester, 
associate 
chair 
and professor of Electrical 
Engineering 
and 
Computer 
Science on Jan. 31.
The email requested that 
for any courses planned for 
the future, the library should 
not be listed as a location and 
current office hours or related 
sessions must be relocated. 
The email noted the main 
reason office hours cannot be 
held in the library is because 
the library is not certified for 
classroom use.
“The 
Library 
has 
not 
approved the use of library 
space for any scheduled office 
hours to take place, and the 
Library is not Bureau of Fire 
Services (BFS) certified to 

hold class sessions in our 
buildings, such as the ones 
taking place in the Shapiro 
basement study space,” Griffes 
wrote in the email. “Since we 
do not have BFS certification, 
we are in violation of safety 
and fire codes every time your 
classes advertise their hours. 
On Monday night, there was 
a large class of 30 students in 
this space.”
The 
email 
specifically 
mentioned that EECS office 
hours violated the fire code, 
and IAs were never given 
permission to hold office hours 
in the UGLi. 
“When library staff informed 
the GSI that we do not permit 
classes in our open study 
spaces, the GSI, who indicated 
they were from the EECS 
department, said that they had 
permission 
from 
professors 
Volkovich and Kamil to use 
the Library to host this class,” 
the email continued. “No such 
permission has been granted. 
Even when it is a smaller group 
of students receiving office 
hours tutoring and instruction, 
the cumulative effect violates 
the fire code.”
In an email to The Daily, 
Liu confirmed Noble sent an 
email to all Computer Science 
Engineering faculty on Feb. 
3 after receiving the initial 
complaint.
Noble wrote to The Daily 
that the issue was resolved 
because he spoke to Kati Bauer, 
interim chief operating officer 
of the Duderstadt Center, who 
confirmed that office hours 
could be held at the Duderstadt. 
However, 
Bauer 
responded 
saying she only spoke for the 
Duderstadt, not the UGLi.
Before the incident at the 
UGLi, Robinson had never seen 
the email, even though it was 
about his office hours. 
“This has already been out 
for nearly a week,” Robinson 
said. “I was unaware of this, 
this was not sent to the actual 
IAs ... the first time that I had 
heard this was when UGLi staff 
came over to me.”
Rebecca Dunkle, associate 
librarian 
for 
Library 
Operations, said the purpose 
of the library is not for office 
hours.
“The library is open to 

everybody, but we get a lot 
of 
requests 
from 
different 
departments from faculty to 
GSIs, to see if they have office 
space for them to see if they 
can have conversations with 
their students, and we don’t 
have enough space for them,” 
Dunkle said. “We understand 
they need space, but the library 
can’t provide that kind of space 
for the departments.”
LSA 
sophomore 
Harry 
Fu is an EECS 203: Discrete 
Mathematics 
IA 
and 
had 
coinciding office hours with 
Robinson. He also expressed 
frustration with the limits on 
capacity.
“For my office hours, I get 
anywhere between 40 and 60 
people,” Fu said. “I think the 
Design Lab and the library is 
supposed to be a tiny, quiet 
space — that really causes an 
issue with the people that are 
trying to make sure the library 
stays what a library should be.”
Though Fu is sad about the 
loss of office hours at the UGLi, 
he said he understands why 
they were kicked out. 
“It’s inconvenient for me, 
but I can’t really blame them 
for kicking me out,” Fu said. 
“It is loud, and it is somewhat 
disruptive, 
and 
it’s 
just 
a 
function of so many people.”
Baker echoed this sentiment.
“I, 100 percent, agree with 
them and their safety concerns 
and us taking up a ridiculous 
amount of space,” Baker said. “I 
think that given the resources 
they’re provided with, the IAs 
are doing their best to combat 
that.”
 
After 
leaving 
the 
UGLi, 
Robinson said IAs had to look 
for alternative locations to hold 
their office hours on Central 
Campus.
He said that some were 
holding office hours in the 
Math Atrium and Fishbowl, 
however, not all transitions 
were that easy. Robinson noted 
that another IA he knew had a 
difficult time finding an office 
hour location. 
“Another 
location 
we 
tried was the IdeaHub in the 
(Michigan) Union,” Robinson 
said. “We were kicked out of 
the IdeaHub. They moved to 
the connector between Union 

and West Quad.”
Baker said he experienced 
this uncertainty in locations as 
his class was constantly being 
asked to move.
“They’re being forced to 
move 
around 
to 
different 
places, which shortens their 
office hours, and they’re able 
to help fewer kids than they 
would be if the CS department 
had 
a 
little 
foresight 
and 
booked a room somewhere,” 
Baker said.
Without a set room location, 
Baker said he sees this issue 
happening again in the future. 
Baker said if they don’t have 
access 
to 
announcements 
through 
Piazza, 
an 
online 
chatroom 
for 
many 
EECS 
classes, then people wouldn’t 
know where to go.
“A lot of the time, it’s hard to 
communicate that to everyone, 
in real-time, because they don’t 
have a plan, they just move 
from place to place,” Baker 
said.
Fu said there’s a delineation 
between the abilities of a 
student organization and an 
IA. 
Student 
organizations 
are eligible to book rooms on 
Central Campus, while IAs 
have the same booking rights 
as a normal student. However, 
the study rooms he is able to 
book as a student, he said, are 
not large enough to fit the 
number of students who attend 
his office hours.
“As IAs, we don’t have 
the same power as a student 
organization, so we don’t have 
the right to reserve study 
rooms,” Fu said. “The study 
rooms that typical students can 
reserve are not big enough to 
sustain the 60 people that come 
to my office hours.”
Bauer clarified that office 
hours can still be held at the 
Duderstadt basement and that 
the basement is separated from 
University Libraries. 
“We’ve talked it over — 
we have spaces where it’s 
appropriate 
to 
hold 
office 
hours, and we’re more than 
willing to let folks do that,” 
Bauer said. “The one email 
message that went out was 
from 
librarians 
and 
they 
have a part of the Duderstadt 
Center, but they are not the 
entire Duderstadt Center, so 

they can’t represent the entire 
building. We certainly don’t 
have any problems with them 
being held as long as they are 
not 
mandatory. 
Mandatory 
office hours are more like a 
class, and our building is not 
certified for classes through 
the state.” 
Even though North Campus 
is open for office hours, Fu said 
many students prefer Central 
Campus office hours. Fu said 
he tries to keep his office 
hours on Central Campus to 
make them more accessible to 
students who need help.
“It’s a lot more convenient 
for (students) to go to Central 
(Campus) office hours, and the 
class is already hard enough as 
it is, and I want to make sure 
that the students know that 
we’re there for them and we’re 
there to work through the class 
together,” Fu said. 
Dinka said he hopes these 
newfound solutions on Central 
Campus are long-lasting and 
office hours do not move to 
North Campus.
“It’s ridiculous that EECS 
wouldn’t have office hours on 
Central Campus considering 
that’s 
where 
most 
people 
live,” Dinka said. “It’s a huge 
inconvenience 
taking 
time 
out of your day going all the 
way up to North Campus, and 
of course, North Campus will 
be just a bit more crowded at 
certain points of the day, too, 
because of it.”
Some students The Daily 
spoke to attributed the inability 
to find spaces to house office 
hours to the growth in the 
number of students majoring in 
computer science. With more 
students in the course, there 
will be more students attending 
office hours, which requires a 
large space to accommodate all 
the students
With the spike in EECS 
enrollment, 
students 
are 
beginning to become frustrated 
with more issues than spaces. 
In a different project-focused 
course, Baker said he sat in 
office hours for a total of five 
hours and was helped twice. He 
also said he was disappointed 
in the inability to register for 
classes he wants to take, and 
instead has to register for the 
classes left over.

“If they can’t properly make 
arrangements for the number 
of students they have in the 
CS program, then they need to 
find new ways to cap it,” Baker 
said. “They can’t keep taking 
our $60,000 and not be able to 
provide us with the resources 
that they say they are going to 
provide us with.”
However, Fu doesn’t believe 
the situation should be solely 
attributed to over-enrollment. 
“In a way, you can attribute 
it to that, but I think it’s really 
hard to address a problem of 
over-enrollment because I feel 
like the alternative is denying 
people that want to pursue 
a career that they love the 
chance to do it,” Fu said. 
According 
to 
the 
CSE 
department, the number of 
students that enrolled in a 
CS-Engineering degree in Fall 
2010 was 317. In Fall 2018, the 
enrollment was 1219. 
Joanna 
Millunchick, 
associate 
dean 
for 
undergraduate education for 
the College of Engineering, 
said they are trying to find 
solutions to the space issue, 
but they do not want to cap the 
program at a certain number 
of students because it leaves 
interested students out.
“We can’t limit the number 
of students that want to do this, 
because then where are they 
going to go?” Millunchick said. 
“We’re also trying to create 
other avenues and awareness 
about other avenues. … We’re 
looking 
closely 
at 
other 
ways for students to be able 
to get degrees that are still 
meaningful to them.”
To help alleviate the office 
hours problem, Millunchink 
said that she would be open 
to 
having 
the 
department 
rent spaces for office hours, 
and noted that the new Ford 
Robotics Building being built 
on North Campus will provide 
more classroom spaces for 
students. 
“We’ve got to get these 
students places where they can 
study and hold office hours,” 
Millunchink said. “I’m willing 
to do that.”

Trouble for U.S. in Southeast Asia

S

ince before the formation of 
the post-World War II order, 
the United States has made 
notable efforts to create a network 
of allies and support throughout 
Asia. One of the earliest American 
partners was the Philippines, and 
the relationship between the two 
countries spans back to 1898. In 
the aftermath of the Spanish-
American War, Spain ceded the 
rights to its former colonies — 
which included the Philippines — 
to the U.S.
While 
the 
land 
remained 
an 
American 
territory 
and 
protectorate 
for 
nearly 
50 
years, 
formal 
diplomatic 
ties 
between the newly-independent 
Philippines and the U.S. began 
in 1946. Since then, the two 
nations have become frequent 
collaborators in defense, trade and 
other realms. The U.S. has also 
incurred heavy human costs in its 
commitment to the island nation, 
as the capital city of Manila houses 
the largest U.S. military cemetery 
of any other country. The histories 
of these countries are strongly 
intertwined, and their alliance has 
been mutually beneficial.
These days, the status quo 
of 
U.S.-Philippines 
relations 
appears to be in danger. Last 
week, Filipino President Rodrigo 
Duterte announced his decision 
to annul the 1998 Visiting Forces 
Agreement. This deal laid out 
the terms of U.S.-Filipino armed 
forces 
cooperation 
and 
the 
stationing of American troops in 
the Philippines, a fundamental 
aspect of the partnership. Duterte 
spoke of his belief that his country 
“cannot forever rely on other 
countries for the defense of the 
state.” The Filipino leader appears 
firm in his conviction and has 
given no indication of being open 
to negotiations.
This tension has been building 
over the past few years. The 
Duterte 
administration 
has 
frequently 
clashed 
with 
U.S. 
leadership since his election four 

years ago. Among the strongest 
sticking points between the two 
countries has been Duterte’s policy 
toward drug crime in his country. 
He infamously compared himself 
to Adolf Hitler and implied he 
would perpetrate genocide against 
drug users and dealers. Such 
disturbing language and resulting 
policies have resulted in Duterte’s 
alienation of the U.S., and the 
American response has been 
strong. This latest point of conflict 
came about after U.S. officials 
cancelled the visa of Philippine 
Senator Ronald Dela Rosa, who 
helped engineer Duterte’s violent 
policies against drug offenders. 
In response, Duterte threatened, 
then completed his country’s exit 
from the agreement, much to the 
chagrin of high-ranking Filipino 
foreign policy officials.
The U.S. acted justly when 
it chose to set an example that 
figures like Dela Rosa will not 
be given special consideration 
and rights to visit the country. 
Duterte’s 
demagogic 
rule 
in 
Manila has set a negative tone 
in relations with the U.S and 
produced 
horrifying 
policies. 
Yet this case of erosion of the 
American-Filipino 
relationship 
also serves as a warning for 
those concerned about American 
interests in Southeast Asia.
Throughout his time in office, 
Duterte’s Philippines has shown 
a pivot toward embracing China 
and moving away from American 
influence. One example of such 
behavior is the Filipino president’s 
willingness to collaborate with 
Chinese President Xi Jinping on 
an oil and gas project in the South 
China Sea, even with the key 
term of the agreement being that 
the Philippines would no longer 
pursue its claims against China 
for its activities in the area that 
undermine Philippine sovereignty.
Such a development should 
be quite frightening to those 
who value a vibrant network of 
American international relations. 

Though Duterte’s foreign policy 
is mainly a break from that of his 
predecessors, it is concerning 
that one of America’s longest-
tenured allies in Asia is quickly 
gravitating toward China’s sphere 
of influence at the expense of the 
U.S. If the Philippines can fall 
into President Xi’s hands, what 
is to stop other Southeast Asian 
countries from being lost as well? 
China’s meteoric rise to the upper 
echelon of the world’s economies 
has paid off in attracting new 
partners around the world. If it can 
successfully present itself to states 
in the region as an alternative to 
American partnership, the U.S. 
will be worse off in the future.
Though 
the 
current 
state 
of affairs might represent a 
problematic emerging pattern, 
it is important to remember 
that Rodrigo Duterte is just one 
man. It is possible, especially 
given the opinions carried by the 
Filipino people toward China, 
that his time at the premiership 
of 
the 
Philippines 
will 
end 
shortly. Perhaps other Southeast 
Asian nations will look to the 
Philippines as an example of how 
not to approach a relationship 
with their American partners.
Regardless, 
the 
U.S. 
must 
continue to invest its time, capital 
and energy in its relationships 
with nations around the globe, 
but particularly in Southeast Asia. 
At a time when China’s brand of 
authoritarian rule appears to be 
a fashionable model for foreign 
governments, 
America 
should 
continue to not only lead by 
example, but serve as an active 
and engaged partner for its friends 
worldwide. As for the Philippines 
specifically, the U.S. should not 
bend the knee to Duterte. It 
should remain willing and eager 
to continue building strong ties 
when a new leader steps into the 
president’s office in Manila.

Judge, jury and — too often — the executioner
W

hen cousins Walter and 
Gaspar came to the 
United States fleeing 
gang violence and widespread 
corruption in El Salvador, their fate 
was a sadly familiar one for many 
applying for asylum. The two men’s 
applications were denied and they 
were deported back to El Salvador. 
Once they were back home, Walter 
and Gaspar were taken from their 
beds and beaten for days by local 
police.
Walter and Gaspar were lucky. 
After 
experiencing 
extensive 
physical 
and 
psychological 
abuse in police custody, they 
were eventually released. But 
not everyone escapes dangerous 
police interrogations alive. A week 
ago, rights advocacy organization 
Human Rights Watch (HRW) 
released a report detailing the 
violence that many unsuccessful 
asylum applicants — much like 
Walter and Gaspar — often face 
when they are forced to return to 
their respective home countries 
after being denied asylum.
No one really monitors what 
happens when denied applicants 
are sent back to El Salvador, and 
HRW’s recent report aims to help 
“fill that gap.” When an immigrant 
applies for asylum, their case will be 
reviewed in front of an immigration 
judge. That one individual controls 
the 
difference 
between 
life 
and death for asylees. In many 
instances of asylum application 
denial, a judge will rule that the 
applicant cannot demonstrate they 
had a credible and well-founded 
fear of persecution or harm in their 
home country or that the applicant 
would be a significant national 
security risk to the U.S. Several of 
the cases in the HRW report call 
into question whether many of 
the deportations that result from 
denied applications are to blame for 

the deaths and injuries of asylum 
applicants upon returning to their 
countries of origin.
President Donald Trump has 
made his hardline stance on 
immigration a cornerstone of his 
political agenda as well as a crucial 
rallying cry for his base. While the 
president has attracted attention 
for the crude language he has used 
to describe immigrants, Trump 
himself directly regulates and 
oversees little of U.S. immigration 
policy. 
Instead, 
administrative 
agencies within the executive 
branch, such as the Department 
of Justice, carry out much of the 
political changes and intricacies 
of the legal immigration process. 
Still, Trump’s widely-discussed 
executive 
orders 
that 
have 
attempted to restrict immigration 
flows — such as announcing a travel 
ban on predominantly Muslim 
countries or ending temporary 
protected status for Salvadorans, 
much to the protest of senior agency 
officials at the Department of State 
who strongly advised against the 
decision — are only the tip of the 
immigration iceberg. 
HRW’s recent report is powerful 
because it indicates some denied 
applications are dismissed all too 
easily. When establishing landmark 
decisions, 
immigration 
judges 
should be aware of the power they 
hold over vulnerable people and 
consider reports like HRW’s as 
evidence of the growing need for 
asylum approval.
The U.S.’s current asylum policy 
clearly endangers lives. Previous 
immigration decisions — such as 
Matter of AB-, which overturned 
protections for victims of domestic 
abuse or gender-based violence — 
should be revisited by immigration 
courts and reconsidered when used 
as legal precedent in cases for those 
trying to apply for asylum relief. 

It’s hard to grapple with the 
flaws in immigration policy when 
you aren’t an immigration judge 
or administrative agency official. 
While students at the University 
of Michigan can’t individually 
change the U.S.’s immigration 
policy, they can certainly show up 
to support a candidate who does 
in the Michigan primary in March 
and 
the 
presidential 
election 
in 
November. 
The 
remaining 
Democratic 
candidates 
have 
opinions about immigration that 
fall across the political spectrum, 
so it’s important for potential voters 
to be informed about what each 
of the candidates advocates for. 
Joe Biden’s plan for immigration, 
for example, is likely the most 
conservative of the remaining 
candidates, as it seeks to keep 
many current statutes concerning 
undocumented 
immigration 
in 
place and does not structurally 
change asylum policy. Protestors 
have been quick to point that out 
as well as express frustration 
regarding 
former 
President 
Barack Obama’s track record of 
deportations.
Candidates 
such 
as 
Pete 
Buttigieg, U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, 
D-Hawaii, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 
D-Mass., Tom Steyer and Sen. 
Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., have all 
stated the need for improving 
asylum application reviews and 
eliminating or limiting family 
detention (Biden, Bloomberg and 
Klobuchar did not take a stance 
on asylum on either Politico’s or 
The Washington Post’s poll). The 
other candidates’ platforms would 
certainly be small victories in the 
larger fight for asylum applicants 
in the U.S., but important steps 
toward progress nonetheless.

Healthy equality is not equity

JENNY GURUNG | COLUMN

A

ccording to Healthline, 
27.5 million people did not 
have health insurance in 
2019, and about half of uninsured 
adults cited high cost of coverage as 
the reason for remaining uninsured. 
One of the main barriers to health 
care is the expense of the programs. 
High 
premiums, 
deductibles, 
copays 
and 
coinsurance 
of 
insurance 
plans 
are 
a 
major 
issue, especially given that most 
individuals in the U.S. have private 
insurance. According to the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention, 
most uninsured adults came from 
low-income backgrounds. Among 
adults, 27.4 percent of those who 
were poor, 25.1 percent of those who 
were near-poor and 8.3 percent of 
those who were not poor lacked 
health insurance coverage in 2018. 
(“Persons categorized as ‘poor’ 
have a ratio less than 1.0 (i.e., their 
family income is below the poverty 
threshold); ‘near poor’ persons have 
incomes of 100% to less than 200% 
of the poverty threshold; and ‘not 
poor’ persons have incomes that 
are 200% of the poverty threshold 
or greater.”) The result of this: 
Americans with higher income 
have better health outcomes than 
those with low income because 
they are almost always guaranteed 
health care coverage.
This “disproportionate risk of 
being uninsured, lacking access 
to care, and experiencing worse 
health outcomes” is called a 
health inequality, also known as 
a health disparity, which refers 
to a difference in the presence 
of 
disease, 
health 
outcomes 
and health care access between 
different populations. A health 
inequality can be an inevitable 
health difference based on age or, 
more notably, a higher likelihood 
of low-income individuals to suffer 
from chronic conditions like heart 
disease and diabetes which have 
an adverse effect on quality of 
life. These health inequalities are 
closely tied to income inequality 
which is exceptional in the U.S. It 
has become increasingly important 
for federal and local governments 
to prioritize initiatives aimed at 
reducing 
income-based 
health 
disparities, especially as income 
inequality has persisted and health 
care costs have increased.
In the past year, health care 
has been a defining issue many 
Democratic 
candidates 
have 
campaigned on. In 2019, Sen. Bernie 
Sanders, I-Vt., introduced the bill 
S.1129-Medicare for All, which 
would automatically enroll all U.S. 
residents for health insurance and 
cover essential medical services. 
Medicare for All is a single-payer 
health care proposal that would 

streamline the current multi-payer 
health care system and eliminate 
the private sector’s role in providing 
and paying for health care.
Currently, 
Medicare 
is 
a 
government-provided 
health 
insurance program only available 
to people aged 65 or older (and some 
younger people with disabilities). 
Medicare covers about half of all 
health care expenses and people 
often have to pay out-of-pocket 
(OOP) expenses or join another 
health insurance to cover the 
uninsured services. These OOP 
expenses include copays, premiums 
and deductibles, which go back to 
financing the insurance.

The new Medicare for All 
bill based on Sanders’s proposal 
is an expanded version of the 
current program all U.S. residents 
would be eligible for. It would 
essentially eliminate all private 
insurance, 
including 
employer-
based coverage. The bill states 
that private insurance can only 
be “supplemental” to the program 
to offer coverage for services 
not covered under it. This would 
be a huge change to the current 
health care system, where over 
68.9 percent of adults have private 
insurance. 
Furthermore, 
this 
current system costs significantly 
more than public health insurance.
There are a number of defining 
health 
insurance 
proposals 
made by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 
D-Mass., a cosponsor of Sanders’s 
bill, former Vice President Joe 
Biden and other candidates. Biden 
has proposed the Biden Plan, which 
is a public insurance program 
that would reshape rather than 
eliminate private insurance while 
increasing the scope of Obamacare 
(Affordable Care Act).
Regardless of the type of 
policy, providing health care to all 
individuals is the first step toward 
eliminating 
health 
disparities 
in the U.S. The rhetoric, though, 
shouldn’t 
be 
about 
“insuring 
more 
than 
an 
estimated 
97 
percent of Americans” as Biden 
says. Everyone should already 
have access to health care, not 
just 97 percent of us. Health is a 
fundamental human right and 

these policies only resolve the 
first problem, lack of access to 
health care. The availability of 
health care to everyone should be 
a given. These policies only make it 
so that everyone has access to the 
same level of health care, but does 
not address the systemic health 
inequities that have become deeply 
rooted in our health care system.
Health inequities are specific 
types of disparities that are 
avoidable, unjust and the result 
of 
continued 
and 
persistent 
health differences. When health 
differences are “preventable and 
unnecessary, allowing them to 
persist is unjust,” writes Mariana 
Arcaya, Alyssa Arcaya and S.V. 
Subramanian 
from 
Global 
Health Action. The underlying 
difference between inequality 
and inequity is that the latter 
suggests injustices against a 
vulnerable 
population 
group 
based on race or ethnicity. Unlike 
age-related health differences, 
health 
inequities 
are 
clearly 
demonstrated in things such as 
higher rates of infant mortality 
among 
Black 
children 
than 
white children. This difference 
in mortality rate is seen among 
Black and white children in the 
same income group as well which 
suggests the underlying cause of 
this inequity is “rooted in social 
injustice.”
A powerful visual for health 
equity is three people standing 
behind a fence, each a bit shorter 
than the person before him. If 
you give them all an equally sized 
stand, only the tallest one will be 
able to see beyond the fence. The 
two others still won’t be able to see 
beyond the fence. Health equity 
is the idea that you give each of 
them the correctly sized stand that 
lets them all see beyond the fence. 
Healthy equality is not equity.
The current policy proposals 
presented only touch upon the 
underlying 
causes 
of 
health 
disparities and inequities in our 
health 
care 
system. 
Equitable 
health care access involves more 
than equal access to health care. It 
requires the equitable distribution 
of resources, finances and benefits 
to those who need it. Our current 
multi-payer 
system 
is 
neither 
equitable nor equal. We, as college 
students and voters, need to call 
upon our representatives to reassess 
the distribution of both resources 
and funding to fully understand 
how we can redesign and shape 
our current health care system to 
reduce persisting health disparities 
and inequities.

Guided By Voices has always 
basically been known as Bob Pollard 
and a bunch of guys with day jobs. 
He was the driving force behind 
the band in any of its iterations. 
Whether it was back in the ’80s 
when they were still recording out 
of a garage or in the ’90s when they 
sounded like they were recording 
out of a garage, Pollard’s presence 
has stayed the same.
Aside from Pollard’s constancy, 
the structure of the band has never 
been consistent: The number of 
members present and prior is 
21. The morphology of the band 
became so convoluted that there’s 
an 
official 
timeline 
depicting 
the change in formation on their 
Wikipedia. In all honesty, the only 
asset that really propelled Guided 
By Voices into becoming a well-
recognized member of the indie 
rock scene was Pollard. His esoteric 
lyricism and musical quirks were 
by far the band’s greatest strength. 
This was his band. That’s why it’s 
so surprising that he seems to be 
the one dragging the band down on 
their latest release, Surrender Your 
Poppy Field. 
This 
is 
not 
to 
say 
the 
instrumentation 
is 
anything 
particularly 
mind 
blowing 
or radical. If anything, the 
sound is a bit dated, drawing 

comparisons to Olivia Tremor 
Control or Semisonic. But even 
their critically acclaimed releases 
from the ’90s sounded dated. They 
were purposely going for a lofi
 
approach, which, in all honesty, 
sounded better on Ween’s The Pod 
or anything by Beat Happening. 
The music on Surrender Your Poppy 
Field simply gets the job done with 
the occasional standout track. A 

few notable tracks include “Arthur 
Has Business Elsewhere” and 
“Steely Dodger,” the latter of which 
sounds like The Books tried to make 
standard rock music. This is an 
improvement from their previous 
post-reformation 
records 
that 
inexplicably tried to hold on to their 
lofi endeavors from decades earlier.
The biggest problem with this 
album is that Bob doesn’t have 
anything to say. This was never the 

case beforehand, as his sharp wit 
was the biggest attraction to any 
Guided By Voices record. At best, 
he’s able to string together a few 
clever bars on the record. At worst 
... oh God. At worst, there’s “Cul-
de-Sac Kids.” Nothing about this 
song suggests a right to exist. How 
does a 62-year-old man sing “Cul-
de-sac kids have the best parties” 
and “Boy, those sac kids throw 
good parties” with any sincerity? 
The answer: he doesn’t. It has all 
of the vocal absurdity of Frank 
Zappa’s “Catholic Girls” with just 
about none of the irony. Mix this 
with the worst instrumentation on 
the album and you get a real mess 
of a milkshake. This is one of those 
songs that completely halts any 
momentum for at least the next few 
songs. Unfortunately, the album 
doesn’t provide anything to bring it 
back from such a low.
It’s a shame that one song 
functions as a grenade, wrecking 
the enjoyment of an album. 
Surrender 
Your 
Poppy 
Field 
had the potential to be a fairly 
decent record, at least relative to 
their more recent work. Instead, 
we’re given a confirmation that 
Guided By Voices should stop 
putting out records. At the very 
least they need to take more time 
crafting better sets of songs. 
When you’re putting out three 
records in one year, it suggests 
that you don’t understand the 
concept of b-sides. One can hope 
they’re only putting out two 
albums in 2020.

ALBUM REVIEW
ALBUM REVIEW

Adapted from the hit podcast 
of the same name, Epix’s new 
docu-series “Slow Burn” — which 
details the people involved in the 
events of the Watergate Scandal 
— has joined the trend of podcast-
turned-television shows, and it 
certainly will not be the last. In 
our current media climate, the 
endless profit possibilities that 
different intellectual properties 
offer has nearly every network or 
platform scrambling to attain the 
rights to reproduce stories we’ve 
already heard before, but just on 
their platform. There’s absolutely 
nothing wrong with adapting 
a series from one medium to 
another, but the qualities that 
make a podcast great are separate 
from what makes a television 
series great.
Great 
podcasts 
make 
you 
feel close to the text. The voice 
speaking to you invites you to 
imagine and create your own 
understanding of the story as 
it’s being told. Podcasts-turned-
television series, on the other 
hand, command you to sit down 
and take in a single version of the 
story unfolding before your eyes. 
“Slow Burn” wants us to imagine 
what it felt like to live through 
Watergate in real time. It gives 
listeners a different perspective 
on the events we think we know so 
well, stripping away the collective 
knowledge of the event in order 
to tell the story from the very 
beginning. 

The visual element that “Slow 
Burn” returns to the most is the 
image of an empty living room 
that screams 1970s — a wooden 
coffee table, a walnut bookshelf, 
an FM radio controlled with a 
dial. With each return, it becomes 
easier to imagine yourself being 
there, living through the events, 
catching a snippet of the daily 
Watergate news coverage as you 
go about your day.
The brilliance of the title 
“Slow Burn” is how host Leon 
Neyfakh perfectly evokes the 
feeling of a literal slow burn 

with his suspensful storytelling. 
Recounting 
history 
through 
our 
collective 
memory 
often 
results in only remembering the 
popular assumptions and forced 
narratives. In other words, we 
remember the outcomes, but not 
the specifics, such as the people 
involved.
“Slow Burn” is all about 
the people involved. Neyfakh 
repeatedly invites us to forget 
about what we already know 
about Watergate and imagine 

ourselves as observers who have 
no idea what the “third-rate 
burglary” that barely made it 
into The Washington Post might 
eventually 
lead 
to. 
Neyfakh 
loves bringing our attention to 
figures who “played roles in the 
story that are larger than history 
remembers.” The series opener is 
centered around Martha Mitchell 
— the wife of Nixon’s Attorney 
General — and outlines her 
role as the initial whistleblower 
in the Watergate scandal. The 
episode also recounts the Nixon 
administration’s successful smear 
campaign to dismiss Mitchell as a 
crazy alcoholic in order to control 
the narrative. 
Without Mitchell, it’s very 
possible 
that 
the 
truth 
of 
Watergate would have never 
come out. Mitchell’s courage to 
speak out, the steps taken by the 
government to keep her quiet 
and to turn her into some sort of 
delusional person are not talked 
about as often as it should be. The 
relevance of Mitchell’s treatment 
by the press and the Nixon 
administration 
is 
particularly 
relevant considering the way our 
current president disregards and 
discredits anyone who speaks out 
against him. This episode details 
Mitchell’s role in Watergate, and 
the rest of the series should bring 
back important figures that have 
been forgotten by history and the 
slow burn of the truth. The next 
time someone tells you a story 
that’s so outrageous that you 
can’t believe it, remember that 
sometimes the craziest thing to 
come out of someone’s mouth may 
very well be the truth.

Watergate’s ‘Slow Burn’

EPIX

Sometimes it’s actually worth 
reading the jacket copy — a lot 
hides there. Lidia Yuknavitch’s 
debut story collection, “Verge,” 
is, apparently, “a group portrait 
of 
the 
marginalized 
and 
outcast in moments of crisis.” 
Yuknavitch apparently “offers 
a shard-sharp mosaic portrait 
of human resilience on the 
margins.” The blurbs on the back 
of the book have more to say 
about this theme: the novelist 
Dorothy Allison writes that 
“I know these people, I know 
their dilemmas, and where I 
don’t recognize them, I believe 
them.” The essayist Melissa 
Febos offers that the stories 
“showed me how resilience is 
forged through survival, beauty 
through 
brokenness, 
joy 
by 
fire.” In the acknowledgements 
to the book, Yuknavitch writes, 
“to everyone anywhere living 
in the in-between of things: I 
get it.” As it turns out, this use 
of the term “marginalization” is 
used in a slippery, broad way; it 
encompasses anyone who is in a 
position somewhat illegible from 
the point of view of normative 
society. 
Yuknavitch 
writes 
about both war refugees and 
women frustrated with their 
relationships, 
incarcerated 
people 
and 
people 
who, 
dissatisfied with bourgeois life, 
begin to identify with elsewhere. 
The key is a sense of incongruity 
with the dominant narrative of 
what a person should be doing. 

I 
am 
focusing 
on 
this 
peripheral material — jacket 
copy, acknowledgements, blurbs 
— because it necessarily primes 
readers for the text, and because 
Yuknavitch 
herself 
doesn’t 
frame these stories, yet they 
clearly go together. “Knowing 
people” and “believing them” 
are functions of compassion — 
the statements in the packaging 
of the book indicate an ethical 
bent to Yuknavitch’s fiction, 

one where bearing witness to 
the lives of marginalized people 
is a way to find out about “the 
world we live in now.” Empathy 
seems to be the function of this 
book, its rationale. In this book, 
we as readers will bear witness 
to the stories of the resilient 
outcast, broadly defined; we will 
have compassion for them. This 
framing material is basically 
an insistence on Yuknavitch’s 
ability as an author to shape 
these particular experiences into 
a form that readers will be able to 
understand. 
I’m 
interested 
in 
the 

assumptions 
inherent 
in 
empathy, 
especially 
as 
an 
ethic of literature, especially 
when “literature” means $26 
books published by an imprint 
of MacMillan. I feel like an 
audience is implied when a 
book claims to be a vehicle for 
empathy. This is to say, two 
groups of people are created by 
books like this — the readers, 
the ones who empathize; and the 
subject, who is empathized with. 
This, of course, is common 
in fiction. The way Yuknavitch 
writes about her subjects is often 
troubling, though. The opening 
of one of the shortest stories in 
the collection, “A Woman Going 
Out,” is a minutely detailed 
description of a woman shaving 
her legs in the second person: 
“Take the razor up smooth 
against the slight resistance of 
stubble, flick the wrist at the top, 
dip the head into the water, swish 
it around, then back down to the 
ankle for the next run. Flesh 
smooth-appearing in a track 
through white foam. Do it again.” 
Like the flesh appearing from 
under the leg hairs, Yuknavitch 
likes to slowly reveal her subjects 
at the beginning of the stories, 
starting 
disorientingly 
close 
and then slowly zooming out. 
This story, which is less than a 
page long, reveals the woman’s 
genitalia in a moment that feels 
like it was meant to trip up the 
reader. “Over the knee to the 
thigh, pause; same with the 
other leg, pause; scrunch it inch 
by inch up the thighs to the balls 
pushed back up into the cave, to 
the penis tucked tight between 
the legs and secured with a 

thong … ” 
We do not, in fact, see the 
trans 
woman 
going 
out. 
It 
stops here, in her bathroom, 
letting the body signify in 
place of the woman’s mind, 
personality or actions beyond 
the cosmetic; it effectively erases 
her 
personhood 
as 
separate 
from her body. The story relies 
on 
the 
reader 
experiencing 
the trans woman’s genitals as 
surprising and alien; the story 
gets its narrative shove from the 
othering of the titular character. 
I’m not mentioning this story 
because I take special issue with 
Yuknavitch’s fictional treatment 
of trans people. I’m mentioning 
it because outside of the context 
of 
the 
collection’s 
thematic 
umbrella, this story would be 
fully visible as a mechanism for 
othering a person. I found myself 
wondering after this story about 
how much of the depiction of 
people on the “verges” of things 
requires establishing their state 
as abject.
This same kind of othering 
appears 
in 
different 
stories 
in other guises. In “Second 

Language,” a Lithuanian woman 
is engaged in prostitution in 
Portland. She doesn’t understand 
English very well, and navigates 
her new country in a dissociative 
haze. The prose style Yuknavitch 
uses is intensely bodily and feels 
slightly unmoored from reality. 
“The front man lived near a 
freeway — what freedom was 
it meant to have? — in a snot-
colored two-story house with 
black plastic in the windows 
where curtains in the windows 
where curtains should be. When 
she knocked on the door, her 
throat cords braided and her 
vertebrae rattled.” There is an 
intense fixation on this woman’s 
body, even outside of the sex 
scenes, the story is full of pale 
wrists, neck veins, intestines. 
The story’s fixation is on how 
the experience of prostitution 
robs the woman of her ability to 
understand herself or her world, 
her lack of fluency in English just 
another way she feels displaced. 
Her body becomes the only thing 
that signifies, and all it signifies is 
a use value — the meaning of this 
woman’s life is stripped away by 

the new country, her experiences 
there. It’s more than a little 
painful to read. The ending is 
unsatisfyingly redemptive — the 
woman tells a Slavic folktale as 
a way of furtively hanging onto 
some aspect of her self-definition 
(“There was one thing besides 
her body that she possessed — 
a story, in a foreign tongue but 
still a story”) and in the end 
Yuknavitch’s 
story 
takes 
on 
the character of a folktale. The 
woman guts herself with window 
glass and spills her entrails onto 
the pavement, and in doing so 
calls down greywolves from 
the 
mountains 
surrounding 
Portland, who avenge her against 
her clients and her pimps. The 
ending of the story is something 
like the statement of a moral: “I 
tell you, do not go near that place. 
Do not go near it. Greywolves 
guard the ground there. Girls are 
growing from guts, enough for a 
body and a language all the way 
out of this world.”

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

I fell asleep while watching 
“The Call of the Wild.” 
For the first half of the movie it 
feels like nothing is happening. The 
first forty minutes are completely 
episodic, with almost no thread of 
continuity or consistency keeping 
each scene together, with the 
exception being that each story 
has the dog Buck as the central 
character.
The whole movie follows Buck 
from his role as the spoiled house 
dog to his decision to accept his 
role in nature and the wild. And 
while the audience empathizes 
with 
because 
of 
the 
awful 
circumstances of his life — like the 
abuse he often faced at the hands 
of humans — frankly, the fact that 
the dog is completely CGI’ed threw 
me off. It’s not like I was expecting 
the creators of the movie to train 
a real dog to do everything that 
the Buck of the original Jack 
London novel did, but it still felt 
wrong. To me, watching a movie 
centered around animals becomes 
unnatural when they have almost 
human expressions on their faces. 
The animals become caricatures 
of the roles they are supposed 

to have in the film when they 
become too similar to humans. 
The overwhelming use of CGI also 
begs the incredibly concerning 
question of whether or not we’ll 
even need people in the film 
business anymore, which is a little 
too ‘robots taking over the world’ 
for me. 

Harrison Ford (“Star Wars: The 
Force Awakens”), while receiving 
top billing for the film in his role as 
John Thornton, only really appears 
midway through. When John and 
Buck meet, the story really picks 
up. Their blossoming relationship 
is easily the most tender part of the 
film. They genuinely care about 
each other and protect each other 

against all adversaries. 
Throughout the film, there is a 
wild black dog figure that serves 
as a symbol for Buck’s instinct 
and desire to answer the wild’s 
call. Soon he begins to think that 
he should succumb to it. The 
love John and Buck feel for each 
other makes the ending of the 
film bittersweet, as John is pulled 
toward the human world and Buck 
toward the wild. 
However, 
their 
relationship 
is 
the 
only 
interesting 
and 
worthwhile part of the film. There 
are a few interesting action scenes, 
like when Buck leads his pack 
away from an avalanche, but those 
are few and far between. And 
since they all feel disconnected 
from one another, you lose interest 
quickly. Combined with a cringey 
voiceover from Ford throughout 
the whole movie and a weird 
hybrid of too much CGI and not 
enough reality, the film falls flat. 
I never read the book, so I don’t 
know whether or not true fans 
of the book will love or hate this 
movie. But, in my opinion, this 
wasn’t a movie that needed to 
be made. It’s a classic, a literary 
masterpiece in the eyes of many, 
but the depth of the story is 
probably best transferred through 
prose, not a nearly dialogue-less 
film.

You’re better off if you 
ignore ‘Call of the Wild’

There are many things to 
love about tap dancing. There is 
the shuffle, an even beat made 
from the balanced forward-
backward brush of the ball of 
the shoe across the floor. More 
rhythmically, the flap involves 
a syncopated brush forward 
that ends in a separate tap with 
the ball of the foot. For more 
complexity, the riff requires the 
toe and heel to dig through the 
ground in separate movements 
that create a deeper and longer 
sound. The riffle combines the 
riff and the shuffle, which can 
also be combined with a flap 
for a fuller opening sequence. 
Each of these steps makes 
up a distinct sound that must 
be perfected with a clarity 
similar to hitting keys on a 
piano. 
When 
put 
together, 
the individual notes create a 
sequence of taps and stomps 
and scuffs and drags that 
create rhythmic music with 
the feet. When done at the 
highest level, these sounds are 
crisp and energizing to watch. 
When performed by Dorrance 
Dance at the Power Center last 
weekend, they are downright 
mind-boggling. 
The 10-member company, 
headed by MacArthur “Genius” 
recipient Michelle Dorrance, 
spent the weekend in Ann 
Arbor as part of the University 
Musical 
Society’s 
2019-20 
season. On Saturday night, 
the audience took up almost 
every available seat in the 
theater, clapping and gasping 
and wooing for the entire 
70 minutes of the dancers’ 
rhythmic 
art. 
The 
group 
performed two shorter pieces 
— “Jungle Blues” and “Three to 
One” — before the titular show 

of the evening, “Myelination.” 
Though different in style, all 
three pieces highlighted the 
crisp genius of each tapper 
onstage. 
“Jungle Blues” acted as an 
homage to older jazz. Dancers 
dragged their taps along the 
tap dance specific floor and 
allowed 
the 
conveniently 
placed microphones to absorb 
the 
graceful 
sound. 
One 
member completed a blurringly 
fast section of improvisation, 
while another moved around 
the stage through exaggerated 

weight changes complemented 
by the loud noises made by his 
shoes every time he fell. The 
piece warmed the audience to 
the sounds of distinct beats and 
happy music. 
“Three to One,” darker in 
presentation, built off of this 
introduction. 
One 
dancer, 
wearing tap shoes, stood in 
between two barefoot men 
at the center of downstage. 
Together, 
they 
completed 
sequences 
of 
the 
same 
movements — three sets of 
feet, two of them silent and one 
of them loud. The dichotomy 
was fascinating, and a bridge 
section of jumps with eerie 

contemporary dance added to 
the piece’s dark beauty. 
“Myelination” 
was 
more 
than twice as long as the first 
two, with a myriad of mood-
shifting vignettes to showcase 
individual 
dancers’ 
talents. 
The 
choreography 
blended 
impressive shades of hip-hop 
alongside the tapping. The 
range between the two styles 
created a breadth that visibly 
excited the dancers; all ten 
beamed with joy. Unlike the 
prior 
pieces, 
“Myelination” 
also incorporated a live band 
onstage. The music melded 
seamlessly with the energetic 
percussion of the tapping. At 
times, a dancer would join the 
band playing instruments — 
one was handed an electric 
guitar, another surreptitiously 
took over the drums — blurring 
the 
lines 
between 
music 
and movement. In essence, 
Dorrance Dance asked: Why 
separate the two at all?
One 
of 
the 
greatest 
advantages 
of 
tap 
dancing 
over other dance styles is its 
potential for noise. Often the 
only noise considered in tap 
is loud metal percussion, an 
unapologetic clanging that is 
most impressive when it is clear, 
precise and rapid. Dorrance 
Dance included plenty of this 
skillful, crowd-pleasing noise. 
But they also explored the less 
obvious musicality in tap — the 
soft swish of a body crawling 
across the floor, thump of 
knees on the ground, the way 
a melodious voice can make 
every staccato ding feel ten 
times more intense.
At the end of “Myelination,” 
we joined the entire crowd as 
they stood up and cheered. It 
was a dance performance that 
felt like a rock concert. And at 
the end of the night, it made 
both of us want to dig up our 
old tap shoes and surrender to 
the joy of noisy energy once 
again.

‘M’ confident after UConn losses

Last week, Baseball America 
ranked Michigan No. 1 for the first 
time in school history — a first for 
any Big Ten team.
Such a ranking is obviously 
a high honor, but it comes with 
expectations as well. Any time 
a No. 1 team loses, it’s the kind 
of upset that receives national 
attention. 
Still, Michigan coach Erik 
Bakich made it clear that he sees 
such a response as an overreaction 
in the case of the Wolverines’ (4-3 
overall) 2-1 series loss to UConn 
(3-3) this weekend.
Bakich cited letting innings get 
away from the team as Michigan’s 
chief problem from the weekend. 
The 
Wolverines’ 
bullpen 
struggled, and their hitters were 
not as competitive in the box as 
Bakich would have hoped in the 
team’s two losses to the Huskies. 
But Bakich emphasized that these 
problems are uncharacteristic of 
his team.
“It’s not like I’m seeing these 
guys for the first time these past 
two weeks,” Bakich said. “I’ve 
learned a lot about the team and 
their consistency through the 

entire fall and how they go about 
training up until this point, so I 
do think we have a very tough, 
hard-working and resilient group 
of kids who had a tough weekend.”
The idea of staying the course 
pervaded the Wolverines’ post-
game message, typifying the 
team’s belief that this weekend 
will be remembered as nothing 
more than a mere blip in an 
otherwise successful campaign.
“I’ve learned that the team 
has a high level of believability 
in themselves and a high level 
of 
confidence 
after 
opening 
weekend,” Bakich said. “And 
hearing them today when we were 
down 9-1, I didn’t hear a team that 
was defeated thinking they were 
out of the fight. I mean the verbiage 
coming out of the dugout, the way 
we competed those first four at 
bats in the ninth — if we had done 
it every at bat of the weekend, we’d 
have had a different result.”
Michigan’s current 4-3 record 
looks unimpressive at first glance, 
but the Wolverines feel that they 
have all of the pieces necessary 
to compete at the level of their 
current ranking.
“We just have to get it out 
consistently, we’re too good of a 
team to have slip ups like this,” 

Bakich said.
And Bakich has a plan to get 
this consistency out of his team.
“We need to simulate situations 
in the games that hurt us this 
past week,” Bakich said. “Imitate 
high-leverage situations and just 
try to create an environment 
that’s faster than the speed of the 
game to recalibrate our eyes and 
what we’re seeing. ... I think just 
the more we can have training 
reps that are random and chaotic 
in nature and unexpected and 
challenging then these situations 
that arise in the games, we’ll be 
able to handle them better than 
we did this weekend.”
Bakich and his coaching staff 
used that technique a lot last 
season, and anyone who watched 
Michigan play in last year’s 
postseason saw its effectiveness.
Multiple 
players 
mentioned 
before opening weekend that 
the goal for this season was to 
get back to Omaha and end the 
season ranked No. 1. They never 
mentioned wanting to be No. 
1 in February, and while the 
Wolverines may have just lost 
their early season No. 1 ranking, 
the team still believes it can 
possess that title when it matters 
most.

T

wo weeks, seven games 
and one-tenth of a 
championship-length 
season have already trans-
pired. But 
only some of 
those games 
are guar-
anteed, and 
based on the 
tinkering 
Michigan 
coach Erik 
Bakich is 
perform-
ing with 
his pitch-
ing staff, it would appear he’s 
gunning for game 70.
“On paper,” Bakich said, 
“we have some key pieces that 
we know that have a resume 
that have had success in the 
past, and then we have a 
bunch of unknowns.”
Whether an entity is known 
or unknown, the priority is 
winning games. Bakich hasn’t 
shied away from giving pitch-
ers role-defying work to that 
end. No pitcher’s ego or desire 
for a calcified position has 
proven to be more important 
than winning.
“I’m not worried about 
where I fit right now in the 
rotation,” junior right-hander 
Blake Beers said after his first 
appearance of the season. 
“Our biggest goal right now as 
a staff is to continue getting 
better this week. Whatever 
spot I’m pitching in, and what-
ever spot the rest of my team-
mates are pitching in doesn’t 
really matter as long as we’re 
contributing to our team and 
contributing to wins.”
The team strategy when 
dealing with hitters and the 
lineup, on the other hand, is 
often incongruous with that of 
the pitching staff.
One might argue in favor 
of the status quo on offense, 
pointing to four of seven 
games in which Michigan has 

scored five or more runs. Look 
closer.
Seven runs were accrued on 
only four hits in game one of 
the series against the Huskies, 
including five off just one in 
the first. Eight runs against 
Cal Poly were scraped togeth-
er without a single extra-base 
hit. 
The problems at the plate 
start with junior shortstop 
Jack Blomgren, who hit into 
three fielder’s choices in the 
opening weekend alone and 
who has hit just .250 on the 
season, a far cry from his .314 
clip last season — two quali-
ties undesirable for a table-
setter. They continue with 
junior catcher Joe Donovan, 
whose average and slugging 
percentage are sitting at the 
Mendoza line and sophomore 
second baseman Riley Ber-
tram and his .176/.267/.176 
slash line.
On the other hand, play-
ers in the back half of the 
lineup — freshman outfielder 
Clark Elliott, freshman third 
baseman Ted Burton and 
fifth-year senior first baseman 
Matthew Schmidt to name a 
few — have been powering the 
offense, combining for 11 RBI. 
Senior outfielder Dominic Cle-
menti started at the cleanup 
spot in the first game, but has 
since hit the cover off the ball 
largely in the bottom third. All 
are either freshmen or new to 
seeing consistent game action.
Bakich stashed the fresh-
men at the bottom of the line-
up in the opening series, away 
from the spotlight. 
“I made the mistake of 
shoving (junior center fielder) 
Jesse Franklin up in the 
four-hole his freshman year,” 
Bakich said. “Probably not 
smart on my part to put those 
kinds of expectations on a 
young kid. We did that again 
to (freshman catcher) Jimmy 
Obertop against Vanderbilt in 

the fall game, put him in the 
four-hole — that was a nice 
four strikeout game.”
But with the end of the 
season constantly staring 
Bakich and the team in the 
face, how many games will 
it take for him to prioritize a 
higher quality lineup in front 
of dimming the spotlight 
on his newbies? When will 
the freshmen invade the top 
half of the lineup, providing 
increased protection to the 
hitters around them than the 
veterans currently installed in 
those spots? Just like Burton 
and company benefited from 
beginning the year at the bot-
tom of the order, so too could 
the struggling veterans.
Redshirt sophomore out-
fielder Danny Zimmermann’s 
usage is certainly a bright 
spot. He started the season 
coming off the bench, but 
Bakich has since begun to 
allow him and his team-lead-
ing 1.059 OPS to do maximum 
damage in the cleanup spot. 
After redshirting the 2019 
campaign, Zimmermann is an 
example of a relative unknown 
whose talents are being used 
to the fullest.
“There were so many dif-
ferent breakout candidates 
that could be on the horizon,” 
Bakich said after the MLB4 
tournament on Feb. 16. “Just 
guys that had their moments 
in different games that could 
be positive contributors for 
the entire season.”
The breakout candidates 
have revealed themselves. It’s 
time to use them in ways that 
maximize win possibility: 
benefiting from and providing 
lineup protection, with more 
chances to hit with runners 
on base.
In other words, it’s time to 
treat them like the pitchers.

Freshman right-hander Chandler 
Dennis entered the circle. At 
the plate stood Hannah Carter, 
Dennis’ first collegiate opponent. 
Shortly after, Dennis got the 
Cyclone swinging — strike three. 
That was it for Dennis’ first 
time on the rubber. One batter. 
She came in to relieve sophomore 
right-hander Alex Storako on 
Saturday in an inning where Iowa 
State had put up four runs on 
the Wolverines. Prior to Dennis’ 
entrance, 
the 
Cyclones 
were 
winning 5-1. 
The stakes were low. Any 
damage a freshman pitcher like 
Dennis may have caused was 
already done before she stepped 
up to pitch. For Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins, this was the 
moment she needed to give Dennis 
a chance.
“Well we’ve been watching her 
in practice since she got here,” 
Hutchins said. “And at some point, 
when we’re behind in the game, it 
was a good opportunity to get her 
in.”
It was. 
In 
her 
small 
opportunity, 
Dennis showed enough to be given 
another chance. Later that day, 
Michigan played No. 22 South 
Carolina, and Dennis was given a 

bit more responsibility.
It was another relief situation 
where the Wolverines were down, 
but instead of only facing the final 
batter, Dennis was handed the ball 
with over an inning left to play.
She finished the one-and-a-
third innings of the game allowing 
just one hit. Again, Michigan lost, 
but Dennis had proven her ability 
against a true opponent. 
Hutchins had seen enough this 
time to raise the stakes once more. 
Sunday morning, Dennis was 
given her first start.
“Getting my first start of course 
got a little bit of the nervous juices 
flowing,” Dennis said. “But I love 
competing with my team, and 
there was no doubt in my mind 
that they had my back on defense.”
Dennis went through four-and-
a-third innings pitched allowing 
six hits and one run with only 
one strikeout. After Dennis put 
two on in the fifth, Storako came 
in to relieve and gave up a three-
run homerun, tacking two more 
earned-runs onto Dennis’ total. 
Her first start wasn’t perfect, 
but Dennis knows that.
“I think I just need to work,” 
Dennis said. “I think I could have 
done better at getting ahead in the 
count. I think I pitched to contact 
a lot this week.”
On that, Hutchins and Dennis 
are in lock-step. Where they aren’t, 

is in whether the problems were as 
isolated as Dennis seems to think. 
“I think today’s performance 
they got a lot of bat on the ball,” 
Hutchins said. “We need to see 
(Dennis) paint the corners.
“But to be fair, every one of 
our pitchers has got to paint the 
corners much better. All of our 
pitchers are putting too much ball 
over too much plate. And as you 
see, we’ve given up too many big 
hits and we need to dig in here.”
Despite 
their 
superior 
experience, 
starting 
pitchers 
Storako and junior left-hander 
Meghan Beaubien threw similar 
games to Dennis over the course 
of the invitational.
This lackluster pitching no 
doubt contributed to its 1-3 record 
on the weekend. And while it is not 
the result Hutchins would have 
liked to see, it opened the door for 
a third pitcher in the Wolverines’ 
rotation to show her worth.
“I think (Dennis) is really 
capable of some great things,” 
Hutchins said Jan. 28. “And I 
think she needs to see herself as 
great. She needs to have some 
determination everyday and every 
pitch — like all of them. They’re 
always a work in progress.”
This weekend, Dennis made 
her debut as a Wolverine. It wasn’t 
perfect, but it was progress. And 
that’s just what she needed.

When 
something 
doesn’t 
work, you change it.
When it still doesn’t work, you 
keep making changes in order to 
find the solution.
Michigan 
softball 
was 
searching for a solution this 
past weekend. The problem: an 
uncharacteristic lack of offensive 
production. The solution: making 
changes to the lineup.
Going into the weekend, the 
Wolverines were averaging 5.22 
runs per game, a respectable 
number by any measure. But 
in the first three games of 
the 
Gamecock 
Invitational, 
Michigan only managed to put 
up two runs. Total.
“We didn’t do a real good job 
at the plate of swinging well and 
swinging free,” Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins said.
It was no coincidence that 
in 
those 
three 
games, 
the 
Wolverines suffered their first 
two losses of the season. Their 
only win on the weekend came 
from a 1-0 victory over Liberty, 
held together by pitching and 
defense.
Hutchins 
knew 
something 

needed to change. 
“We moved people around as 
we’re trying to find something 
to spark our offense,” Hutchins 
said.
Some sparks were found. 
Senior Abby Skvarce found 
a place in the batting order as 
designated player and left fielder, 
previously only getting a chance 
as a pinch hitter. Skvarce hit .333 
on the weekend in her new role. 
Senior Thais Gonzalez was also 
able to find success, producing 
for Michigan wherever she was 
placed in the lineup. Gonzalez 
showed versatility by hitting in 
the eighth, ninth and second spot 
in the batting order over the four 
game slate. The final game was 
the one in which she took up the 
most responsibility by batting 
second, and still she produced, 
batting 1-for-2 with one run in 
the game. 
Another notable adjustment 
came from freshman second 
baseman Julia Jimenez moving 
into the lead-off position ahead 
of struggling outfielder Lexie 
Blair. The sophomore is hitting 
just .175 this season — a stark 
contrast to her .406 average a 
year ago. 
Here, the Wolverines may 

have found one solution. 
“Juju (Jimenez) I thought did 
a really nice job,” Hutchins said. 
“Juju didn’t make it any bigger 
than it was. Which was, ‘I’m 
batting.’ She doesn’t care when.”
Jimenez 
echoed 
Hutchins’ 
thoughts: 
“I just have to be on my A-game. 
No matter what happens, I just 
have to keep rolling with it and 
just do my best to stay up there. 
Just help my team out.”
Skvarce, 
Gonzalez 
and 
Jimenez were responsible for 
10 of the team’s 20 hits on the 
weekend as well as three of its 
seven runs. Each member of 
the trio — whether they were a 
starter before this weekend or 
not — found themselves in a new 
position in the lineup. With their 
new positions came new roles, 
and they delivered.
That was the purpose of 
Hutchins’ 
changes 
— 
move 
players around and see what 
works. So with Skvarce, Gonzalez 
and Jimenez producing in new 
spots, 
one 
could 
reasonably 
expect them to remain there. 
For Hutchins though, it’s not 
that simple. Because although 
there were sparks, they didn’t 
start a fire.
The 
Wolverines 
finished 
the weekend 1-3, and they only 
scored more than one run in 
the final game. The trio made a 
positive impact, but the entire 
puzzle wasn’t complete. 
“I don’t think there’s any 
right answers or not,” Hutchins 
said. “You know when our 
offense definitely isn’t clicking, 
it’s definitely difficult to know 
who to put where. … We’re 
going to continue to give people 
different looks and different 
opportunities. 
“The people that can handle it 
and compete when they’re called 
upon are those who are going to 
end up with it.”
New opportunities bring new 
changes to the lineup. Hutchins 
is prepared for that. She knows 
that eventually, the lineup will 
settle, but now is not that time. 
Now, 
Michigan 
needs 
solutions. And for solutions, it 
needs change.

Wolverines’ defense leading team

When any team is searching for 
its identity, it deals in moments.
Players, fans and pundits alike 
look for one game, one tournament, 
one shot to define a season or 
sometimes even entire programs. 
For instance, the Wolverines’ 
miracle run to the final game of the 
2018 NCAA Tournament is defined 
by Jordan Poole’s 3-point prayer 
to advance past Houston. This 
season, it’s been The Bahamas.
Early in the season, it was all 
anyone could talk about when 
discussing Michigan basketball. 
And it’s easy to see why.
The Wolverines marched into 
Atlantis an unproven, untested 
team with a million question 
marks and a brand new face on 
the sidelines. They delivered an 
incredible 
three-game 
stretch 
downing two top-10 teams. It 
was the type of tone-setting 
performance that programs dream 
of and coaches froth over.
But once Michigan hit a four-
game skid after losing star junior 
forward Isaiah Livers to injury, 
the performance in The Bahamas 
became a double-edged sword 
— an expectation against which 
everything else was measured.
And perhaps the comparison 
wasn’t unfair. Even Michigan’s 
own players would often compare 
the team’s mental fortitude and 
in-game attitude to its peak in the 
Caribbean. 
Freshman 
forward 
Franz Wagner was one of the first 
to highlight this disparity when 
discussing the team’s apparent lack 
of emotion in a loss on the road to 
Iowa, stating that during the team’s 
string of losses the team hadn’t had 
the same emotional level as in The 
Bahamas.
But 
now 
the 
Wolverines 
have won five straight and the 
comparisons 
are 
starting 
to 
resurface, but in the best way 
possible for Michigan.
Assistant coach Phil Martelli 
wasn’t shy to make the comparison 
following the Wolverines’ road win 
against Purdue.

“I thought in The Bahamas, we 
looked like an offensive team,” he 
said. “Now I think we look like a 
winning team.”
With Livers back in the starting 
lineup and Michigan convincingly 
winning games at an elite level, not 
only are the Wolverines playing 
like they did in The Bahamas, 
but they might be even better, 
according to Martelli. So what’s 
the difference now?
The short answer: defense.
And the stats flesh that out. 
In 
The 
Bahamas, 
opponents 
averaged 68 points per game and 
now over Michigan’s last five wins, 
opponents averaged 60.4 points 
per game — an astounding near 
eight-point drop off.
Along with overall scoring, 
opponents’ shooting percentages 
have taken a dip as well. Rivals in 
The Bahamas shot 42 percent from 
the floor and now are connecting 
on just 37.2 percent of shots over 
the last five games.
Where things get particularly 
bleak for the Wolverines’ foes 
though comes from 3-point shots. 
In The Bahamas, Michigan was 
effective in limiting perimeter 
shots with opponents shooting 
just 29.7 percent from three in the 
Caribbean. Recently though, the 
Wolverines have been on another 
planet.
In Michigan’s last five games, 
players not wearing maize and blue 
have shot just 23.32 percent from 
3-point range. The Wolverines 
have effectively neutralized any 
shooting advantage a team may 

possess from deep, especially 
focusing 
on 
limiting 
3-point 
attempts while also guarding one-
on-one.
Now it’s just a matter of seeing 
where this defensive change has 
come from.
“For people to understand, 
‘Where did this come from?’ This 
came from the defensive side of 
the ball,” Martelli said. “And the 
tribute goes to Juwan (Howard) 
and 
(assistant 
coach) 
Saddi 
(Washington) as the defensive 
coordinator insisting on shrinking 
the floor. We’re a lot sharper now 
in our scouting reports.”
Giving Michigan’s perimeter 
defenders — highlighted by junior 
guard Eli Brooks, Wagner and 
senior guard Zavier Simpson, 
among others — the sharper 
scouting reports on opposing 
guards has made all the difference.
The Wolverines lost the second 
half against the Boilermakers 
on Sunday — Purdue scored 42 
to Michigan’s 35. But it didn’t 
matter because after only scoring 
21 points on the Wolverines’ 
stalwart defense in the first, the 
Boilermakers just couldn’t score 
enough to win.
“That wasn’t a thing of beauty 
offensively in the second half,” 
Martelli said. “We’re maybe not 
built that way, but defensive side 
of the ball — if we stayed out there 
the next 20 minutes, they were not 
gonna score enough. 
“And that’s what’s happening 
to these teams, they’re just not 
scoring enough.”

How the Irish stymied ‘M’ offense

It was safe to say the Michigan 
hockey team had finally found 
its groove offensively before 
heading into last weekend.
The 
Wolverines 
have 
averaged 4.2 goals per game 
since 
the 
winter 
break, 
dominating 
teams 
with 
an 
onslaught of goals. They were 
making the right passes. They 
were syncing on set plays. They 
were finding the back of the net.
Yet against Notre Dame, 
Michigan could muster only 
a single goal over the course 
of two games — and it was 
scored by an extra attacker 
on 
an 
empty-net 
situation. 
The Fighting Irish stymied 
the Wolverines’ hot hands, 
sweeping them over two games 
at Yost.
Here’s how they did it.
***
Limiting 
Michigan’s 
opportunities in transition
Part 
of 
the 
Wolverines’ 
offensive success as of late 
was due to the high number of 
opportunities they created — 
high shot count, high amounts 
of Grade-A chances.
“Look 
at 
the 
game,” 
graduate 
transfer 
forward 
Jacob Hayhurst said. “We had 
chances, but they played such 
a structure and laid back game 
that we didn’t get the volume of 
chances that we wanted to get.”
The 
Irish’s 
structure 
that 
helped 
limit 
those 
opportunities 
was 
centered 
around 
their 
transitioning 
format. In the earlier series in 
South Bend, Notre Dame had 
played a 1-1-3, which meant 
it had three players fall back 
into the defensive zone, one 
player chasing the puck and 
one person there to help in the 
neutral zone. 
After getting swept, however, 
the 
Irish 
knew 
something 
needed to change.
So 
they 
adjusted 
their 

systems to play an entirely 
defensive and more patient 
approach with a 1-4 structure. 
That meant four players would 
drop back and let only one 
person push forward. The fact 
that four players clustered in 
the defensive zone meant that 
the Wolverines would have a 
tough time with zone entry. 
When it’s hard to bring the puck 
into the offensive zone, it’s hard 
to create offense in general.
Michigan’s counter to this 
was to dump in the puck and 
chase after it, using speed to 
get to the puck behind the net 
before the other team does.
But Notre Dame was ready 
for that as well.
Disrupting 
Michigan’s 
forecheck
A large part of the Wolverines’ 
offense is their forecheck. They 
run a double forecheck system, 
which allows two players to 
contest for the puck behind the 
net in order to retain possession 
in the offensive zone.
“You’re trying to do ABCD 
to create those opportunities,” 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
said. “And part of that is 
establishing a good forecheck, 
and we never could.
“Shouldn’t 
say 
we 
never 
could, but we had limited 
success at that.”
The 
Wolverines 
tried 
dumping the puck into the 
zone and as they met opposing 
players behind the red line, 
they’d forecheck. 
But what they ended up doing 
was shooting the puck behind 
the net for Irish goaltender 
Cale Morris to corral and 
control, 
and 
that 
creates 
another target to contest, which 
makes Michigan’s two-person 
forecheck less effective.
“Then, now we have three 
‘defensemen’ 
you 
have 
to 
forecheck 
instead 
of 
two,” 
Pearson said. “We just didn’t 
work hard enough or weren’t in 
sync enough on our forecheck.”
Already 
unable 
to 
carry 

the puck into the zone, the 
Wolverines’ 
struggles 
to 
dump and chase meant there 
were 
going 
to 
be 
limited 
opportunities to get set and 
work the zone for extended 
periods of time.
Frustrating 
an 
offense 
overall
Michigan was not prepared 
coming into the weekend. It 
knew what to expect out of a 
defensive game — pace, low 
shot count, physical play. But 
the players weren’t prepared for 
just how limited the amount of 
chances they’d get.
“I think if we were better 
prepared with the mindset 
that you just got to really bear 
down on the chances you get,” 
senior forward Will Lockwood 
said. 
“Because 
you’re 
not 
going to get many. These guys 
really just pack it, and you got 
to understand that I think 
the shots were like 20 shots 
between the two teams after 
two periods.
“I think we got to better 
prepare next time, going into a 
game like that where, you know, 
you’re not gonna get too many 
chances, but you gotta bury 
them when you do.”
The 
Irish 
were 
doing 
everything to frustrate the 
Wolverines.
They sit back to prevent 
breakaways. They put a body 
on every puck handler. They 
know how to disrupt an offense. 
Michigan players had come in 
expecting more opportunities. 
They always do. But when 
they were limited and not 
converting, it thinned their 
patience.
“If you’re chasing the game 
all the time,” Pearson said, 
“then they just even collapse 
more on you and then you can 
get more frustrated.”
Added Lockwood: “A team 
like that, no one in the nation, is 
going to put up more than three 
or four goals. It’s a different 
mindset going in.”

Freshman wing Franz Wagner has been key in Michigan’s defensive improvement.

Hailey Brown makes her impact

Naz Hillmon’s free throw 
hit both sides of the rim before 
bouncing out, right in the 
direction of Hailey Brown. The 
junior forward saw her chance 
for an easy putback layup.
But when Brown went up for 
the rebound, she gave Michigan 
State guard Tory Ozment a 
slight push and was called for 
a foul — her fifth. She seemed 
unhappy with the call, just as 
she had on some of her earlier 
fouls.
Despite her frustration in 
the moment, she moved past 
it quickly. As she walked off 
the court, she looked at her 
teammates and yelled, “Let’s 
go. Win this.”
The 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball team led the Spartans 
by five with three minutes 
remaining on Sunday when 
Brown fouled out. A minute 
later, senior guard Akienreh 
Johnson fouled out, with the 
Wolverines still leading by five. 
With Michigan’s two most 
experienced players out of the 
game, it had to hold on with a 
lineup of three freshmen and 
two sophomores. And despite 
being stuck on the bench for 
the final three minutes of the 
game, Brown knew her role 
was as important as ever. She 
was nearly as vocal as she is 
on the court, encouraging her 
teammates and alerting the 
players on the court when a 
screen was being set or there 
was an open player. 
“I was so proud as a coach,” 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico said. “That’s leadership, 
and that’s what we needed at 
that moment.”
The Wolverines held on to 
win, 65-57, and despite Brown 
finishing with just six points 
in 19 minutes, her impact 
was stamped on the game’s 
outcome. Michigan State coach 
Suzy Merchant said after the 
game that the Spartans may 
have been better off if Brown 
didn’t get into foul trouble 
because freshman center Izabel 
Varejão scored more than her. 
But as big of an influence as 

Brown had while on the bench, 
her presence was felt when she 
was on the court. 
Brown doesn’t always light 
up the stat sheet. She’s fourth 
on the team in scoring and fifth 
in rebounding. While she’s 
Michigan’s best 3-point shooter 
— shooting 36.4 percent from 
beyond the arc — opportunities 
from 
deep 
aren’t 
always 
plentiful in an offense that runs 
through Hillmon in the paint.
Sunday, when points were 
hard to come 
by for Brown, 
she made her 
impact 
doing 
what she does 
best: anchoring 
the interior of 
the Wolverines’ 
defense, making 
it 
difficult 
for 
opposing 
players to get 
easy shots near 
the basket. The two players 
that 
Brown 
guarded 
most, 
Kayla Belles and Taiyier Parks, 
combined for just three points, 
and Michigan State as a whole 
shot 11-for-32 on layups.
“She brings that edge, that 
grit, she wants to guard the best 
post player,” sophomore guard 
Amy Dilk said. “She takes on 
the challenge each and every 
night. She’s a great defensive 
player for us.”
Brown seamlessly switched 
off 
screens, 
preventing 
Michigan State players from 
getting 
separation. 
Midway 
through the fourth quarter, 
with four fouls and Michigan 

leading by four, Belles set a 
screen up top for Spartans 
guard Nia Clouden. But Clouden 
couldn’t get anywhere near the 
basket as Brown forced her to 
the corner without committing 
a foul.
When players did get free in 
the paint for open looks, Brown 
sent their shots right back. Early 
in the third quarter, Ozment 
got free from Hillmon on the 
baseline, 
and 
Brown 
came 
out of nowhere to reject what 
would have been 
an easy layup, 
her 
second 
of 
two blocks on 
the night.
“She’s 
been 
one 
of 
our 
biggest helps on 
defense, 
really 
trying 
to 
clog 
up the paint … 
blocking 
a 
lot 
of 
shots 
and 
just altering everybody’s shot 
in there,” Hillmon said. “It 
was tough, having her in foul 
trouble.”
With Brown on the floor, 
Michigan 
State’s 
offense 
struggled to get into a rhythm. 
It was no coincidence that 
the 
Spartans’ 
two 
highest 
scoring quarters were the two 
that Brown only played three 
minutes in.
Brown’s impact this season 
has gone unnoticed at times. 
But despite what the box score 
or Merchant said on Sunday, her 
role in the Wolverines’ win — 
both on the court and from the 
bench — was unquestionable.

Michigan rolls past Edinboro, 33-6

Sometimes, it’s just about 
staying the course.
The 
No. 
21 
Michigan 
wrestling team (7-6) had come 
out of a tough stretch of Big Ten 
dual meets, losing three matches 
in a row against three of the 
top-12 ranked schools. With the 
Big Ten tournament coming up, 
a trip to Edinboro (10-8) could 
have caused some trouble. But 
the Wolverines did not overlook 
the Scots, dominating in a 33-6 
win on Friday.
Michigan was led by a gritty 
effort from fifth-year senior 
Jackson Striggow at 197 pounds. 
Down several points in the first 
period, Striggow fought back 
and took control of the match 
in the later periods, pushing 
the pace and getting several 
takedowns to ultimately secure 
the comeback.
“I didn’t let it get me too 
much — being behind in the 
first — because I knew I am in 
better shape than anybody that 
I wrestle,” Striggow said. “My 
pace would wear him down to 
where I could score points on 
him and take the lead back.”
At 125 pounds, No. 18 redshirt 
sophomore Jack Medley also 
had a strong showing, getting 
several back points to claim a 
23-5 technical fall. Redshirt 

senior 
Austin 
Assad 
next 
claimed a forfeit victory at 133 
pounds, and freshman Cole 
Mattin secured a decision at 141 
pounds. No. 9 redshirt junior 
Kanen Storr kept the momentum 
going for the Wolverines, as he 
picked up a 6-2 decision at 149 
pounds. Redshirt freshman Will 
Lewan also secured a decision 
at 157 pounds to give Michigan a 
large lead, as it headed into the 
break up 20-0.
“We wrestled a really great 
dual,” Michigan coach Sean 
Bormet said. “The guys wrestled 
with a lot of confidence, a lot of 
energy, as a great finish to our 
dual season.”
Following the gauntlet of 
Big Ten duals, and with the 
Big Ten championships coming 
up, this meet could have been 
overlooked. 
But 
Michigan 
avoided the potential pitfall.
“Sometimes coming off of a 
long stretch of Big Ten duals, in 
front of a smaller crowd, there 
could be a letdown,” Bormet 
said. “So I wanted to make sure 
to avoid that, and for them to 
focus on the type of wrestling 
and matches that they were 
gonna have at the Big Ten 
championships.”
The Wolverines head into 
the Big Ten championships on 
Mar. 7. Coming out of the tough 
schedule of Big Ten play — with 
losses in four of the last five dual 

meets — this non-conference 
dual was a useful tune up 
to get the team executing at 
the highest level again, so 
they could be as effective as 
possible during the imminent 
postseason. 
Added Striggow: “I looked 
at it as something to build 
off of heading into Big Ten 
(championships). Keep getting 
better, keep building on the 
good things I did last match and 
the match before that to keep 
giving myself confidence.”
Michigan kept rolling out 
of the break, as redshirt junior 
Tyler Meisinger got his first 
fall of the season with his first-
period at 165 pounds.
After a couple tough losses 
for redshirt freshman Max 
Maylor at 174 pounds and 
redshirt sophomore J.T. Correll 
at 184 pounds, the Wolverines 
got back on track through 
Striggow’s determined victory. 
No. 2 sophomore heavyweight 
Mason Parris finished things off 
for Michigan with a resounding 
major decision, 10-2.
“We’re 
measuring 
how 
we 
wrestle 
match-to-match 
regardless 
of 
opponent,” 
Bormet said. “So we just wanted 
our guys to focus on wrestling 
to 
their 
fullest 
potential, 
executing the way that they 
need to to have success at the 
Big Ten championships.”
