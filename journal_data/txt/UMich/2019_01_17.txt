and former Student Adminis-
trative Assistant Intermedi-
ate for the Inter-university 
Consortium for Political and 
Social Research, alleges her 
employment was terminated 
as a result of reporting sexual 
harassment at the University 

of Michigan.
 Tessier worked for the Uni-
versity from 1998-2004 and in 
ICPSR specifically from 2009-
2015. ICPSR is an international 
research consortium providing 
training on data access, analy-
sis and curation for social sci-
ence research.
 She filed a complaint with the 
University’s Office of Institu-
tional Equity on July 2, 2015 

regarding the continued sexual 
harassment by her supervisor, 
Research Area Specialist Inter 
Dieter Burrell.
Fitzgerald confirmed Burrell 
is still employed at the Univer-
sity. Burrell did not respond 
to multiple requests for com-
ment.
 Tessier’s employment was 
terminated May 15, 2015. Uni-
versity 
spokesperson 
Rick 

Fitzgerald said Tessier’s posi-
tion was terminated due to fi-
nancial concerns.
 “Gwen Tessier’s position at 
ICPSR was one of six positions 
eliminated in 2015 as part of a 
reduction-in-force, 
cost-cut-
ting effort at ICPSR,” Fitzger-
ald wrote in a statement to The 
Daily.

Ramaswami Mahalingam, 
director of the University’s 
Barger Leadership Institute, 
spoke to students Wednes-
day night about the role of 
global feminists in leadership. 
Mahalingam explained differ-
ent theories of leadership to 
the group, switching between 
his lecture and conversation 
with the group.
Mahalingam 
presented 
to advanced fellows in a BLI 
pilot cohort called the Mind-
ful Leader Program. In order 
to become involved with the 
BLI, all members enroll in 
a one-credit leadership lab. 
Upon completion, they are 
afforded the opportunity to 

become BLI Leadership Fel-
lows. Following an initial fel-
lowship, students are given 
the option to either coordinate 
a capstone project or take on 
more advanced fellowships.
Compared to the nearly 200 
students pursuing a capstone 
project, this mindful leader-
ship cohort of only six students 
is much more specialized 
and intimate. Business junior 
Kevin Liu is one of the mind-
ful leadership fellows and was 
in a different advanced BLI 
fellowship last year. He said 
the mindful leadership pro-
gram is different from any of 
his prior experience.
“It’s about journaling and 
reflection and generally being 
mindful of our action,” Liu 
said. “This is a very small 

cohort because it’s a pilot pro-
gram. This is a lot more time 
commitment.”
Mahalingam is an assign-
ment contributor at the Global 
Feminisms Project, a digital 
archive of personal narratives 
chronicling the experiences 
of feminists in seven different 
countries across the world. 
According to Abigail Stewart, 
co-director of the Global Fem-
inism Project and professor of 
psychology and women’s stud-
ies at the University, said the 
project’s two main goals are to 
aid teaching and research.
“The teaching uses and the 
research uses both have been 
very broad,” Stewart said. “So 
there’s no disciplinary limit 
to the different kinds of uses 
they can be put to.”

Following 
Mahalingam’s 
presentation, the group delved 
into a discussion of the con-
tent from the archives.
Mahalingam felt it was 
important for students to 
look beyond the pre-format-
ted images of leadership that 
are taught in a classroom. 
He encouraged the cohort to 
challenge the ideas they previ-
ously held about what a good 
leader looks like. 
Abigail Stewart, director of 
the Global Feminism project 
and professor of psychology 
and women’s studies, said that 
the ideas presented change 
the way society thinks about 
leadership.

The 
Carceral 
State 
Project hosted a symposium 
Wednesday 
night 
in 
the 
Hatcher 
Graduate 
Library 
to discuss the flaws of the 
prison 
experience 
and 
the 
justice 
system. 
The 
symposium, which drew a 
crowd of over 100 attendees, 
is the third installation out of 
six events that will take place 
this academic year.
The Carceral State Project 
is a University of Michigan 
program 
that 
encourages 
collaboration 
between 
faculty, 
students 
and 
the 
community in order to learn 
about 
and 
advocate 
for 
criminal justice reform.
Michigan Mellon Fellow 
Nora Krinitsky, a host of 
the event, said the goal of 
the symposium was to allow 
students 
and 
community 
members to listen to people 
who have been incarcerated 
themselves or have a direct 
tie to the justice system.

Tuesday 
evening 
in an effort to help allevi-

The idea for the survey 
was first conceived last year 
during the winter 2018 CSG

MVision created a portal 
where students could submit 
campaign ideas.

“What else can a person do?” 

Former ICPSR employee alleges wrongful termination after reporting harassment

RACHEL CUNNINGHAM
Daily News Editor

 Interim President of 
Michigan 
State 
Uni-
versity John Engler re-
signed Wednesday night 
in an 11-page letter to the 
Board of Trustees just 
hours after the board 
set a special meeting for 
Thursday with the intent 
to fire him.
 In the letter, Engler 
said it was an honor to 
serve the University.
 “In compliance with 
your request that I re-
sign & in order to ensure 
an orderly transition to 
my interim successor, I 
hereby resign the office 
of President of Michigan 
State University effective 
9 am, Wednesday, Janu-
ary 23.” The letter read, 
“It has been an honor to 
serve my beloved univer-
sity.”
 Engler took over for 
former 
President 
Lou 
Anna Simon on January 
30, 2018 in the wake of 

controversy surrounding 
Simon’s handling of alle-
gations regarding Larry 
Nassar. Recently, Engler 
has been under criticism 
after he made comments 
to The Detroit News on 
Friday stating that Nas-
sar victims are enjoying 
the spotlight.
 “You’ve got people, 
they are hanging on and 
this has been … there are 
a lot of people who are 
touched by this, survi-
vors who haven’t been 
in the spotlight,” Engler 
said. “In some ways they 
have been able to deal 
with this better than the 
ones who’ve been in the 
spotlight who are still 
enjoying that moment 
at times, you know, the 
awards and recognition. 
And it’s ending. It’s al-
most done.”
 A tweet from Brian 
Mosallam, a member of 
the MSU Board of Trust-
ees, said the resignation 
of Engler is an end to a 
“reign of terror.”

On Jan. 9, the city of Ann 
Arbor received finalized re-
sults of a two-year research 
study about the effects on 
driver-pedestrian 
behav-
ior related to an increase in 
crosswalk signs, law enforce-
ment and general awareness 
of the pedestrian right-of-
way laws.
According to the study 

conducted by the National 
Highway Traffic Safety Ad-
ministration, there has been 
an increase in pedestrian 
traffic fatalities since 2009. 
The study was originally con-
ducted in Gainesville, Florida 
in an effort to decrease pe-
destrian-involved accidents. 
In large cities, pedestrians 
account for 40 to 50 percent 
of traffic fatalities.
To combat this trend, de-
terrents for ignoring pedes-

trian-right-of-way laws were 
expanded. The effects of the 
Gainesville program were so 
significant for decreasing pe-
destrian deaths, a reproduc-
tion of the study was done in 
Ann Arbor to assure it wasn’t 
an isolated trend.
During the timeframe of 
the study, stopping for pedes-
trians in Ann Arbor increased 
from 28.5 to 65.2 percent 
where there was police en-
forcement, and from 34.2 to 
53 percent at the general-
ization sites that did not 
receive 
police 
enforce-
ment. Police enforcement 
came in the form of warn-
ings and tickets.
Throughout the dura-
tion of the entire study, 
1,658 warnings and 844 
citations were issued by 
the Ann Arbor Police De-
partment. Some raised the 
concern that the increase 
in stoppage came solely 
from the presence of en-
forcement, but Raymond 
Hess, transportation man-
ager in Ann Arbor, stated 
in a press release that the 
final report concludes en-
forcement alone can’t ex-
plain the steady increase 
in cars that are willing to 
stop.
“Evidence that the high 
visibility 
elements 
that 
were introduced in a step-
wise manner contributed 
to the overall success of 
the program,” Hess wrote 
in the statement. “If driv-
ers only responded to ac-

tual enforcement operations 
it would be more likely that 
the effects would be confined 
to sites that received enforce-
ment.”
Sergeant Bill Clock of the 
Ann Arbor Police Depart-
ment shared that the increase 
in pedestrian safety was not 
solely due to the increased 
police deployment, but was 
a combined effort from many 
city parties.
“The first year we did it, it 
was strictly enforcement, but 
then we went back and did 
a follow up in 2018,” Clock 
said. “With more education 
through city communications 
department and the traffic 
engineers, we were not sur-
prised at the improved re-
sults.”
Clock said he is unaware 
of any further police supervi-
sion of the crosswalks, but he 
believes the traffic engineers 
will continue their work to 
make pedestrian crosswalks 
more noticeable.
“There’s nothing planned 
for us, in regards to this ac-
tivity, but we will continue 
to check crosswalk and fol-
low up on complaints,” Clock 
said. “But I think the city traf-
fic engineers will use data to 
make crosswalks more visible 
to do further improvements.”
LSA senior Ben Harsh-
berger owns a car on cam-
pus. Harshberger said he was 
aware of the law when it came

we discussed some potential 
projects for making campus 
more affordable. They men-
tioned that Ohio State put out 
a landlord report card every 
year and I thought it was a 
great idea. Then, when Dan-
iel’s party was campaigning 
for CSG, their policy director 
reached out to me for sugges-
tions and I relayed the infor-
mation to him.”
CSG 
President 
Daniel 
Greene believes the report 
card empowers student voic-
es in the off-campus housing 
process and provides a way 
to collect data, allowing stu-
dents to be better informed 
in the decision making pro-
cess.
“We haven’t had the data 
to substantiate the things 
that go on [yet],” Greene said. 
“Now there is an open incen-
tive for housing companies 
to better treat students and 
reward those companies and 
individuals who treated our 
Michigan students as if they 
were adults.”
CSG worked with the Uni-
versity administration to set a 
standard so no housing man-
agement company is reported 
on the guide without having 
at least five responses. Using 
the Ohio State University’s 
guide as a model, CSG dou-
bled the amount of questions, 
including queries pertaining 
to demographic data and spe-
cific housing costs.
Engineering senior Sanjee 
Choudhuri, one of the main 

creators of the survey, want-
ed to find a way to make it 
more interactive and appeal-
ing to students. The team 
decided to add three interac-
tive graphs linked to the CSG 
website.
“I was really interested in 
taking the PDF and putting 

it into a medium where stu-
dents will want to read it and 
enjoy it,” Choudhuri said. 
“So I thought interactive 
infographics—done 
almost 
entirely 
through 
tableau 
graphs. In the end we want-
ed a medium where students 
could track the data, where 
they could tailor it to them-
selves and then share it. It’s 
simple, it’s fun and there is 
no fluff. You can use it imme-
diately and anyone you send 
the link to could figure out 
how to use it.”
The first interactive graph 
showcases a rent map of Ann 
Arbor properties listing the 
company that owns it, the 
rent price and the complete 
rating of the property out of 
10.
The 
second 
infographic 

lists data on a multitude of 
different property manag-
ers, ranking them on a scale 
of one to 10 overall. Those 
ranking the highest were 
Horvath Properties, Spaly 
Group, Zaragon Properties 
and Wessinger Properties. 
Those placing on the lower 
scale of the survey were Tree 
City Properties and Cribspot.
The final link is a bar 
chart composed of each of 
the sentiments poised on the 
original survey. By select-
ing which company listed, 
you can see the results on 
each of the questions. Ques-
tions include how quickly the 
landlords response to main-
tenance requests, the overall 
condition of the living space, 
the professionalism of the 
landlord and much more.
“In an ideal world this 
will be continued by future 
administration,” 
Greene 
said. “We are hoping that we 
will reopen the survey now 
that 
students 
understand 
it. We know when there is 
a new resource on campus 
that it is often too abstract 
for students at first. Now 
that we have the results on 
the website we are getting 
a lot of interest and clicks 
and we hope that this guide 
would help perpetuate the 
conversation and put more 
momentum toward address-
ing housing affordability in 
Ann Arbor and also just hold 
housing companies account-
able, as they often exploit 
students.”

“We very consciously decided 
to decenter faculty voices and to 
decenter campus voices in order 
to really hear from the folks 
who are most directly impacted 
by incarceration,” Krinitsky 
said.
LSA 
junior 
Sydney 
McKinstry, who has attended 
both previous panels, said she 
keeps coming back because 
the speakers give her ideas on 
how to take her passion for the 
criminal justice system and 
turn it into tangible goals.
“I think overall, every time 
I come, I have this sense of 
knowing there are things I can 
do to make it better,” McKinstry 
said. “I think it’s easy here in 
Ann Arbor, as a white student, 
to feel like I have ideas of 
wanting to make the system 
better but I don’t know how to 
put those into actual work. So 
it’s really incredible to see these 
people have careers all over the 
world, and to see that there are 
career paths you can take to 
make actual change.”
Heather 
Ann 
Thompson, 
professor of Afroamerican and 
African studies and history, 
is chair of the Carceral State 
Project and was another host of 
the event. She began the event 
by asking the panelists whether 
they think the imprisoned have 
a fair experience in the U.S. 
justice system. 
Cozine 
Welch, 
managing 
editor of the Michigan Review 
of Prisoner Creative Writing, 
has served 20 years in prison 
and said the justice system 
is not equitable. He said it 
criminalizes people of color, 
those with mental illnesses and 
other minorities.

“So, we all assume that every 
human being is born the same,” 
Welch said. “Assume you don’t 
have any mental disability 
that allows you not to compute 
like an average human being. 
Assume that everyone is equal. 
Yet we look at our criminal 
justice system and we see a 
large overwhelming majority of 
a particular type of person that 
is being incarcerated. That right 
there shows you it’s not a fair 
shake at all.”
Asia Johnson, a formerly 
incarcerated person and bail 
disruptor at the Bail Project 
and Detroit Justice Center, 
agreed with Welch and said 
the mentally ill are often 
criminalized. She added many 
imprisoned people are less 
privileged than others, which 
puts them at a disadvantage to 
begin with.
“When you go into prison, 
you come in broken,” Johnson 
said. “Not just because of your 
crime, but because of your life. 
Because of what society has 
given you.”
Gift Chowchuvech, former 
therapist at Women’s Huron 
Valley Correctional Facility, 
said most people she met were 
traumatized as children by the 
people they grew up with. She 
discussed how many prisoners 
never learned how to make good 
choices and how it affects their 
odds of ending up in prison.
“Every 
man 
that 
I 
interviewed had a history of 
trauma,” Chowchuvech said. 
“Trauma that happened early in 
their lives ... what you have is a 
lot of intergenerational trauma 
because people don’t have those 
family groups to teach them 
how to make good decisions.”
The discussion then moved 
on to mental health and its role 
in the criminal justice system.
Welch, who has attempted 

suicide three times, claimed the 
justice system does not want to 
pay to help convicts with their 
mental health and that results 
in many people never receiving 
the aid they need.
“Because that requires extra 
work on the side of all of those 
involved, right,” Welch said. 
“And so we (the criminal justice 
system) have to now classify 
you differently and put more 
resources into you or find some 
way just to scoot you along and 
hope you’ll be alright.”
Welch said he still feels scared 
to walk around Ann Arbor alone 
for fear of being arrested again. 
He also discussed how fear is 
used as a weapon in both prison 
and outside. He said prisoners 
are afraid of their correction 
officers, so they act tough. 
To give some insight on the 
perspective of law enforcement, 
he also claimed the correction 
officers, who are often very 
outnumbered, are also scared 
and often feel the need to prove 
they are in control.
Welch went on to say prison 
is not fulfilling its main goal: 
rehabilitation. 
She 
argued 
oftentimes correction officers 
will punish the prisoners too 
harshly, and prison itself is 
punishment enough for one’s 
crimes. She said, as someone 
who worked in a correctional 
facility, prisoners become sub-
human.
“Prison 
is 
supposed 
to 
be about is rehabilitation,” 
Chowchuvech said. “What we 
often fail to understand is being 
incarcerated. There should not 
be other punishments for you 
while you’re there. What you’re 
ingrained with when you come 
to work in a prison is that ‘a 
prisoner is a prisoner,’ that’s it. 
They’re dehumanized.”

“ DE PORTE D: AN AME RICAN DIVISION ” E XHIBIT

KEEMYA ESMAEL/Daily
Photojournalism Art Exhibit “Deported: An American Division” by photographer Rachel Woolf 
prsented in Weill Hall.

A recent study administered 
by a team of professors and 
students within the School of 
Public Health and the Nicaragua 
Ministry of Health found that 
it may be easier to detect one’s 
susceptibility to influenza by 
simply looking at the bacteria 
present within the throat and 
nose.
Betsy 
Foxman, 
professor 
of epidemiology and a lead 
researcher on the project, said 
the team was interested in how 
contracting influenza makes it 
more likely for someone to get 
other diseases.
Foxman’s particular interest 
was 
how 
the 
microbiome, 
bacteria and other microbes that 
live in and on the human body 
might influence transmission. 
Aubree 
Gordon, 
assistant 
professor 
of 
epidemiology, 
researched factors that affect the 
susceptibility and transmission 
of 
influenza. 
By 
combining 
both of these areas of interest, 
Gordon designed a household 
transmission study to help gather 
samples and data to see how our 
ever-changing microbes affect 
our response to influenza.
Foxman 
said 
the 
project 
started 
with 
how 
influenza 
contraction affects transmission 
of other diseases.
“It started with the question, 
how 
come 
when 
you 
get 
influenza you might be more 
likely to get pneumonia off of 
strep pneumo and where does 
it come from?” Foxman said. 
“We thought that it would be 

great to look at what happens in 
a household transmission study. 
So when Dr. Gordon joined the 
faculty and I heard about her 
study and immediately went 
to her and asked if she would 
like to collaborate. So, it was 
opportunity plus interest.”
The longitudinal Nicaragua 
household transmission study 
took place between 2012 and 
2014. In the study, members 
within a household of those 
affected 
by 
influenza 
were 
observed carefully for thirteen 
days to see if they would develop 
influenza.
About 710 bacterial samples 
were then collected at the initial 
date of the study and then 695 
samples were gathered at the 
final date of the investigation.
After the study was complete, 
Foxman and her team carefully 
examined the samples of nose 
and throat bacteria collected 
from the initial enrollment and 
applied DNA sequencing to 
help identify the varying types 
of bacteria, which lead to the 
discovery of five diverse types of 
cluster communities.
Foxman said being able to 
study the microbiome was made 
easier thanks to the “miracle” of 
DNA sequencing.
“We can (now) take a sample 
and identify all of the bacteria 
that are living there without 
growing 
them 
individually,” 
Foxman said. “We sequence 
parts of their genomes and 
look relative to databases to see 
(which bacteria) is there and 
their relative abundance. Being 
able to do that allows us to look 

at these communities.”
After the sequencing, the 
team 
applied 
a 
clustering 
technique to group the data into 
clusters, or “community types,” 
which allowed them to see what 
groupings of bacteria appeared 
by looking at the similarities 
evident in the sequence.
By analyzing these clusters, 
Foxman and Gordon could see 
if these clusters predicted risk of 
influenza.’
“We 
discovered 
that 
individuals 
with 
a 
certain 
community 
type 
or 
certain 
microbiome are more susceptible 
to influenza,” Gordon said. “Right 
now, it is pretty preliminary, 
we’re learning so much about 
the microbiome. It looks like it 
affects your response to vaccines 
and your chances of getting 
certain diseases — particularly in 
the case of respiratory diseases. 
The first step is to see how it 
works and the interactions in the 
workplace.”
Foxman hopes to replicate the 
research in different geographic 
areas to better understand the 
mechanisms of the particular 
communities 
found 
in 
the 
Nicaraguan study.
“What we’re looking at now 
is using the data from the study 
to look at how the microbiome 
might affect shedding a virus 
and symptoms, and seeing if the 
microbiome that you have affects 
how sick you are and for how 
long,” Gordon said.

Tessier met with Adriana Oval-
le, OIE Investigator, on July 2, 
2015 to discuss the inappropri-
ate behavior of Dieter Burrell 
and her firing.
According to an Office of Insti-
tutional Equity report provided 
to The Daily by Tessier, OIE be-
gan investigating the matter on 
July 14, 2015. Tessier began in-
teracting with lawyers on June 
19, 2015. Attorney Charlotte 
Croson initially took on Tes-
sier’s case but dropped it soon 
after due to a conflict of inter-
est. Tessier said Croson did not 
explain what the conflict of in-
terest was.
Croson declined to comment 
because she does not currently 
represent Tessier.
Tessier claims the harassment 
was enabled by former ICPSR 
director and Michigan State 
University Professor William 
Jacoby, who has been under 
investigation recently by both 
MSU and the University for sex-
ual harassment against former 
students. University Spokes-
person Rick Fitzgerald could 
not confirm or deny whether 
the investigation was still oc-
curring, but stated that Jacoby 
was not involved with the 2018 
summer program and will not 
be involved in 2019 either.
“Jacoby did not participate in 
the 2018 program and he will 
not participate in the sched-
uled 2019 program,” Fitzgerald 
wrote in a statement. “The uni-
versity does not provide confir-
mation of an investigation nor 
does it comment on investiga-
tions. It’s important to note that 
the university takes every al-
legation of sexual harassment 
or misconduct very seriously. 
Every report we receive is care-
fully reviewed so that appropri-
ate action can be taken.”
Jacoby also resigned from his 
role as Editor-In-Chief at the 
American Journal of Political 
Science after proclaiming his 
innocence on the journal’s web-
site without proper authoriza-
tion. According to the Detroit 
News, Jacoby is currently look-
ing to appeal an MSU report de-
tailing an investigation into the 
allegations against him.
Michigan State University Me-
dia said Jacoby retired from the 
University on Jan. 1.
Jacoby also did not respond to 
multiple requests for comment.

***
Tessier’s OIE report details nu-
merous comments Burrell made 
about women to other ICPSR 
employees, including “I would 
like to get a sex kitten like that” 
in February 2011 and “sex with 
a younger woman is better than 
exercise” in September 2012.
In the report, Tessier com-
plained of Burrell’s behavior 
towards her and accused ICPSR 
of employment discrimination. 
An example of this included 
favoritism towards younger fe-
male workers, who Burrell al-
lowed to work on other projects 
not related to ICPSR. Tessier 
said she was not allowed to do 
this.
Burrell explained in the report 
that he was called into an in-
formal meeting with human re-
sources and another unnamed 
official in 2011 regarding com-
plaints of harassment and in-
appropriate language while at 
ICPSR. At this meeting, he re-
counts he was told to “be care-
ful” about coming into physical 
contact with other people, and 
cautioned against even brush-
ing against them as he passed.
Tessier said one of the first in-
stances of harassment she ex-
perienced was at a reception for 
the ICPSR program attendees 
in the summer of 2009, where 
Burrell allegedly began touch-
ing her without her consent.
“For some reason he just started 
pinching my arm up and down, 
so I just left,” Tessier said. “He’s 
tipping a beer in one hand and 
grabbing me with the other. I 
left immediately and felt silly, I 
really did.”
Tessier stated she did not know 
if Burrell was intoxicated.
Tessier also said she noticed 
Burrell would concentrate on 
her breasts and genital regions 
when speaking with her. Tes-
sier said she did not notice this 
behavior until a co-worker ad-
dressed these concerns to her. 
A legal timeline sent to The 
Daily by Tessier confirms both 
of these statements.
Tessier explained that she ap-
proached Jacoby, who was di-
rector of ICPSR at the time, in 
March 2010 about the incidents 
that had occured with Burrell 
up to that point.
“I said to Bill (Jacoby) ‘These 
things happened. Can you help 
me with this?’ because I was 
getting all this hostile attention 
and stuff from Dieter (Burrell) 
and I didn’t want it,” Tessier 
said. “It was bizarre … His only 

response was ‘Well, I told Diet-
er not to do those things.’ In re-
sponse to the repetitive integra-
tion, Bill said ‘Well, that was his 
doing.’ In other words, Bill had 
instructed Dieter to keep ques-
tioning me over and over again.”
Another incident with Burrell 
occured in the summer of 2011, 
when Burrell allegedly yelled 
at Tessier for using a copier in 
the office, and then beginning to 
poke her body.
“It’s a trivial thing but I’m be-
ing reprimanded for something 
that’s completely trivial and it’s 
part of your whole job process,” 
Tessier said. “At the end of this 
tirade, which I was actually cry-
ing at the end of … he pokes at 
me on my collarbone and my 
chest and then around the belly 
and hip area.”
She said Burrell told her he was 
picking lint off of her clothing.
“I said ‘What are you doing?’” 
Tessier said. “It happened so 
fast and he said ‘I’m just picking 
lint off of you’.”
According to Tessier, she also 
complained to Rita Bantom and 
Diane Winter, both in the ICP-
SR Human Resources depart-
ment at the time. Tessier said 
Bantom and Winter told her to 
tell Burrell off when he touched 
her and to keep record of these 
encounters.
Bantom and Winter have not 
responded to requests for com-
ment.
Tessier addressed this with 
Burrell and Bantom via email, 
and Bantom said she would look 
into it. Email threads sent to 
The Daily confirm this. Tessier 
does not believe anything came 
of her request.
 Tessier said she was given neg-
ative performance evaluations 
by her superiors following her 
complaints, criticizing her for 
taking time off even though that 
time was for two separate peri-
ods of medical leave. One was 
for a shoulder surgery in May 
2014. Tessier said she needed 
the surgery after overusing her 
shoulder from work related ac-
tivities. Another leave was for a 
nervous breakdown she expe-
rienced on August 9, 2013. Tes-
sier notified ICPSR her doctor 
requested medical leave on Au-
gust 12, 2013.

Y

es — the day we have 
all 
feared 
is 
fast 

approaching. 
With 

health issues including two 
cancerous 
nodules 
recently 

removed from her lungs and 
broken ribs, it seems as if 
the day Justice Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg must step down is 
coming quicker than we had 
hoped. Imagining the court 
without the “Notorious RBG” 
requires a dynamic analysis. 
First, we must assess the effect 
that Ginsburg uniquely has on 
the court, and then measure 
the effect (or damage, as we 
liberals like to call it) another 
Trump nominee would have 
on the rulings of hot-button 
cases such as gun control and 
abortion.

Let’s start with what we 

would be losing if Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg was no longer an 
associate 
justice. 
Justice 

Ginsburg is most famously 
known as a maverick and 
trailblazer for women’s rights. 
As one of the first women on 
the Supreme Court, Ginsburg 
has 
made 
the 
greatest 

contribution of any justice 
towards promoting women’s 
rights. Ginsburg is known as 
“the last vestige of an old guard 
of liberalism,” and is the last 
pillar holding up the fragile 
balance between an oppressive 
court and a fair one.

While Sotomayor, Kagan 

and Breyer remain associate 
justices 
within 
the 
court, 

Ginsburg, 
being 
the 
most 

senior left-leaning justice, has 
had a rich history of finding 
creative new ways to uphold 
the rights of all marginalized 
groups, 
especially 
women. 

Whether it be in creating new 
levels of scrutiny within the 
law to address gender-based 
discrimination in United States 
v. Virginia or protecting the 
rights of intellectually disabled 
individuals in Olmstead v. L.C., 
her legal expertise has created 
liberty and equality under the 
law for all Americans. 

So, 
who 
could 
possibly 

replace RBG? In the midst of 
the Trump presidency, one 

thing that is certain is that 
another staunch conservative 
will be appointed to take the 
position of an open seat on the 
court, as was the case with 
Trump’s 
two 
appointments 

thus far. The additions of 
accused sexual assailant Brett 
Kavanaugh 
and 
National 

Rifle 
Association-endorsed 

Neil Gorsuch have pointed 
the court in a decisively more 
conservative 
direction 
even 

with Ginsburg still there.

The significant ideological 

differences that exist between 
Justice Kavanaugh and his 
predecessor, 
retired 
Justice 

Anthony Kennedy, suggest that 
narrowly made decisions in 
favor of women’s rights such 
as Whole Woman’s Health v. 
Hellerstedt 
and 
Obergefell 

v. Hodges would most likely 
not be upheld had they been 
argued in the SCOTUS of 
2019. Now, if we factor in the 
removal of Justice Ginsburg 
and the addition of another 
fairly 
conservative 
justice, 

the court’s 6-3 conservative 
majority would definitely favor 
a right-wing agenda.

Much of this could be seen as 

just angry words from another 
paranoid liberal. I mean, how 
much has the Citizens United 
v. Federal Election Committee 
ruling 
changed 
the 
way 

you brush your teeth every 
morning? While many people 
do not readily admit to the 
large impact of the Supreme 
Court, just ask yourself — 
how many normal events that 
occur in your day-to-day life 
are affected by an entity of the 
government? As we move closer 
to a “nanny state,” we somehow 
come to find the government in 
every nook and cranny of our 
lives, with the consequences 
of the issues being litigated 
applicable more to young adults 
than ever before.

With 
the 
tremendous 

hyperpartisanship 
in 
both 

houses of Congress creating 
either 
extreme 
policies 
or 

no policies at all, we end up 
relying more on the courts 
to 
rectify 
change 
when 

desperately needed within the 
country. Little did you think 
that the person you are allowed 
to 
marry, 
how 
you 
were 

admitted into college or any 
higher learning institute and, 
of course, how much control 
you have over your body would 
be decided ultimately by the 
Supreme Court.

In a sense, how could you not 

care that Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
may be leaving the Supreme 
Court? The issues listed above 
are just the tip of the iceberg 
when it comes to Supreme 
Court cases that Ginsburg has 
played an integral role on. Call 
this some sort of emotional 
ode to the woman herself, but 
if you are an individual who 
cares about equality, women’s 
rights and expanding the rights 
of the people, there is so much 
to be concerned about with 
this woman leaving because, 
frankly, nobody can do what 
she does.

Was my goal in writing this 

piece to scare you? No. Though 
my words may seem to imply the 
potential for a large negative 
shift in a young adult’s life if 
RBG were to retire during the 
Trump presidency, the truth is 
that we all should be realistic 
about the effect this woman 
has had in our lives and on our 
country.

With so much trust based 

in the Supreme Court as the 
arbiter for partisan-poisoned 
politics, there is a lot of 
room for things to go wrong. 
And while I can cite cases 
RBG presided over that may 
not have elicited the best 
result, the resolve and the 
commitment of Ginsburg has 
remained a ray of sunshine 
on dark days. Maybe America 
will see another maverick 
in 
the 
future, 
or 
maybe 

the 
seemingly 
“alt-right” 

conservative ideology of the 
court will be cemented for 
decades to come. Only time 
will tell what lies in the 
future.

What would SCOTUS look like without Justice Ginsburg?

Washington must put country over party to get results
T

his month, Democrats 

officially 
took 
back 

the 
House 
from 

Republicans 
after 

eight years in the 

minority. Powered 

by suburban angst 

over the president, 

Democrats 
come 

to office energized 

to 
oppose 
the 

president 
at 

every 
turn. 
In 

fact, 
Rep. 
Brad 

Sherman, D–Calif., 

introduced articles 

of impeachment against the 

president on the very first day 

of the new Congress. While this 

new development is significant 

given Democratic control of the 

House, Democrats have pledged 

to impeach President Trump 

since he was first elected.

Whatever you may think 

about 
President 
Trump, 

this 
is 
wrong. 
While 
the 

president has certainly been 

controversial, he was chosen 

by the American people to 

serve as our commander in 

chief. Attempting to remove 

the 
president 
before 
his 

term is up is poisonous to 

our 
politics. 
We 
send 
our 

politicians 
to 
Washington, 

D.C. so they can work for us, 

not to play politics. However, 

some Democrats have been 

gleefully anticipating President 

Trump’s 
impeachment 
since 

day one instead of working 

with him. Chief among them 

is newly elected Rep. Rashida 

Tlaib, D–Detroit, who said, 

“We’re gonna go in there and 

we’re 
gonna 
impeach 
the 

motherf-----.” By going on 

profanity-laden rants against 

our president, Rep. Tlaib and 

her cohort have damaged our 

democracy greatly by casting 

aside the results of the 2016 

election in order to satisfy a 

vendetta against the president. 

Washington politicians on both 

sides need to put results over 

politics to move our country 

forward. If we come together 

and achieve bipartisan results, 

America will successfully face 

down the Herculean challenges 

before us.

An excellent place to start 

is 
re-opening 
the 
federal 

government. 
Thanks 
to 

disagreements 
over 
border 

security, the government shut 

down at midnight on Dec. 

22. Despite the great harm 

a government shutdown has 

on 
the 
functioning 
of 
our 

government and our standing 

abroad, 
this 
shutdown 
has 

dragged into 2019 and the 116th 

Congress. This shutdown has 

already had adverse effects 

both nationally and here in 

Michigan. Nationally, 800,000 

federal workers spread over 

nine federal departments are 

going without pay because of 

Washington’s inability to pass 

a spending bill. The 

results of this inability 

to govern are being 

felt here in Michigan. 

The 
National 
Park 

Service 
employees 

who operate Sleeping 

Bear Dunes National 

Lakeshore 
in 

Northern 
Michigan 

are 
not 
working 

because 
of 
the 

shutdown. 
Despite 

the valiant work of volunteers, 

the public is suffering due to 

the absence of park service 

employees. Visitors of that park 

are getting stuck in unplowed 

parking lots and a program that 

brings students to Sleeping Bear 

to learn how to snowshoe has 

been unable to start up. That’s 

a shame, especially considering 

how many Michiganders want 

to enjoy the treasures of our 

beautiful national parks during 

winter. 
Moreover, 
Native 

American tribes in Michigan 

that rely on federal funding for 

essential services are suffering 

as well. In fact, the Sault Ste. 

Marie 
Tribe 
of 
Chippewa 

Indians is losing $100,000 a day 

from the federal government 

for essential services such as 

health clinics.

The nation that defeated 

fascism 
during 
World 
War 

II 
and 
sent 
astronauts 
to 

the moon should be able to 

pass a spending bill to keep 

our national parks open and 

maintain 
health 
clinics 
for 

Native American tribes. House 

Democrats 
ought 
to 
work 

with President Trump to fund 

border security and re-open the 

federal government. President 

Trump has asked Congress 

for more than $5 billion for 

border security while House 

Democrats are unwilling to 

make the investment in border 

security. Speaker Nancy Pelosi 

has refused to compromise on 

this issue, stating, “We can go 

through the back and forth. No. 

How many more times can we 

say no? Nothing for the wall.”

While Pelosi uses rhetoric 

about the wall to fire up the 

Democratic base, the money 

Trump is asking for is sorely 

needed. Though we have made 

progress in securing the border, 

our porous Southern border 

puts our national security at 

risk. Drug cartels that control 

large 
swaths 
around 
our 

Southern 
border 
ship 
their 

poison into the United States, 

fueling the opioid crisis that 

takes 130 American lives every 

day. Given that 90 to 94 percent 

of heroin in the U.S. pours in 

from Mexico, American lives 

depend on our ability to secure 

our border. Beyond drug cartels 

shipping deadly drugs into the 

U.S., murderous gangs such 

as MS-13 also take advantage 

of 
our 
leniency 
on 
border 

security. Just last week, three 

undocumented 
immigrants 

connected to MS-13 stabbed 

a high school student outside 

of a fast-food restaurant in 

New York. This heinous attack 

illustrates 
that 
our 
porous 

border allows gang members 

and other threats to public 

safety to cross into our country 

unencumbered. By approving 

full funding for border security, 

House Democrats would help 

secure the border by hiring 

more 
Border 
Patrol 
agents, 

purchasing updated technology 

and building physical barriers 

where needed. Following our 

actions to secure the border, 

we can take action to protect 

Deferred Action for Childhood 

Arrivals recipients and reform 

our deeply flawed immigration 

system. In securing the border 

and reforming our immigration 

system, we will ensure our 

national security is protected 

and continue our tradition as a 

nation of immigrants.

After passing a spending bill 

that secures our border, we can 

keep the bipartisan momentum 

going on other key issues. While 

campaigning 
for 
president, 

President Trump rattled many 

Republicans with his calls for 

$1 trillion in infrastructure 

spending, government action on 

outrageously high prescription 

drug prices, campaign finance 

reform 
and 
renegotiated 

trade deals. After winning the 

presidency on these unorthodox 

ideas for a Republican candidate, 

progress on these issues has 

largely 
stalled. 
Instead 
of 

calling for his impeachment, 

Democrats should work with 

President 
Trump 
on 
these 

bipartisan issues and deliver 

for 
the 
American 
people. 

By working together on our 

greatest issues, we can restore 

faith in our broken political 

system and ensure our nation’s 

best days remain ahead of us.

W

atching 
sports 

has become one of 
the 
least 
relevant 

parts of professional sports 
fandom. 
That 
may 
sound 

like a controversial and even 
nonsensical statement but upon 
closer examination it makes 
perfect sense. Fans are no longer 
driven to sports because of their 
dedication to a hometown team 
but 
rather 
to 
personalities, 

long-term storylines and the 
drama 
embedded 
in 
every 

sports league.

The NBA is the shining 

example of this burgeoning 
brand of fandom. Fans are 
addicted to following players 
and 
their 
carefully 
crafted 

images. For young fans, this 
transition away from hometown 
solidarity seems obvious. Why 
spend your entire life following 
a team solely because they 
are from your city when you 
can pick a star player whose 
personality 
speaks 
to 
you? 

Why spend years hoping that a 
historically crummy team will 
become good when you can 
follow players and storylines?

In addition to a dedication 

to superstar players, NBA fans 
also have a passion for following 
the overarching narratives in 
the league. For example, at the 
end of December, Zach Lowe 
— widely considered to be the 
NBA’s most prominent writer 
— declared that “Anthony Davis 
trade talk is the biggest story 
in the NBA.” That’s right — the 
biggest story in the NBA has 
nothing to do with how a team 
is playing but rather where a 
player might play in the future.

The best part about the 

Anthony Davis drama is how 
convoluted 
the 
situation 
is 

and 
how 
feverishly 
NBA 

fans are following it. Stick 
with me through the minute 
details 
because 
they 
really 

help to display absurdity of 
new fandom. Davis is 25 years 
old and widely believed to be a 
top-five player in the NBA but 
is playing for the historically 
and currently forgettable New 

Orleans 
Pelicans. 
In 
short, 

Davis has the opportunity to 
sign a contract extension with 
the Pelicans this summer. If he 
signs the extension, he will stay 
with the Pelicans. If he doesn’t, 
he will spend one more season 
with the Pelicans and then he 
will leave. Well, the Pelicans 
aren’t stupid — if Davis leaves in 
two years, then the Pelicans will 
be left with nothing. However, 
if the Pelicans trade Davis, they 
can get a lot of good players in 
return.

But who will the Pelicans 

trade Davis to? If Davis doesn’t 
want to play for the Pelicans, 
where does he want to play? 
These are the million dollar 
questions that every NBA fan 
is trying to answer. Fans and 
journalists alike are picking up 
on all the smallest details such 
as the fact that Davis and LeBron 
James have the same agent 
and that James, who recently 
became an Los Angeles Laker, 
got dinner with Davis in LA. 
In essence, fans are predicting 
what players will want to do 
in two years, following details 
such as who’s getting dinner 
with whom. This can help fans 
make clear predictions what a 
player’s eventual decision may 
be.

Tracking 
dinner 
plans 

and the social implications of 
those plans sounds much more 
like an article out of People 
magazine than it does an article 
from ESPN. The gossip- and 
drama-filled narrative that is 
Anthony Davis’s future is not an 
anomaly. Other popular recent 

storylines include a player’s 
mom 
installing 
cameras 
in 

his house, superstars Kevin 
Durant and Draymond Green 
yelling at each other and former 
teammates calling each other 
“cupcakes.”

This new wave of fandom 

is not some kind of fluke 
— it has clear roots in new 
communications technology. In 
the past, fans could only watch 
the locally broadcasted games 
and 
highlights 
were 
rarely 

displayed on television. Simply 
put, there was no way to live 
in Ann Arbor, watch Anthony 
Davis play in New Orleans and 
learn about his dinner plans. 
Social media and the internet 
have made it extremely easy 
to share highlight clips, watch 
games from across the country 
and follow every decision a 
player makes.

What’s 
more 
fascinating 

to me is how this shift in 
fandom 
is 
discussed. 
Most 

of the discussion, somewhat 
unsurprisingly, is about how fans 
are choosing to watch highlights 
and follow gossip instead of 
watching games and why that 
is costing broadcasters money. 
The more interesting storyline 
is this: A shift away from the 
X’s and O’s of sports seems like 
an incredible opportunity for 
leagues like the NBA to appeal 
to a new set of fans. Instead of 
selling high-flying dunks, the 
NBA can sell America’s favorite 
things: reality TV and gossip. 
How the NBA will go about 
attracting people to juicy gossip 
— instead of actual basketball 
games — remains an unanswered 
question.

So, here is my appeal to anyone 

who watches reality TV and says 
they hate sports: the next time 
you inevitably get thrown into 
a sports conversation, try to ask 
about the drama and the rumors 
and see how things go.

Why all gossip lovers should love the NBA

Shortlisted Man Booker Prize novels are enthralling

“Everything 
Under,” 
Daisy 
Johnson’s 
2018 
Man 
Booker 
prize-shortlisted 
novel 
that 
relocates 
Sophocles’s 
“Oedipus 
Rex” to modern-day England and 
reinterprets the story through what 
some may call a feminist lens, has 
been praised for its daring alone. 
Well, here’s that pat on the back.
Now, on to evaluating Johnson’s 
story itself — or, the point at 
which praise for Johnson ceases. 
Instead of mining the depths of a 
classic like “Oedipus” in pursuit of 
contemporary insights, Johnson 
opts to skim the story for its most 
base content — the fated patricide 
and incest — and exploits their 
sensationalism. 
Johnson 
makes 
the most of what she’s skimmed, 
smearing it into the likeness of a 
novel. Yet all that offers her audience 
in terms of a reading experience 
is the sensation of being dragged 
through the muck.
Still, the opening chapters of 
“Everything Under” will beguile, 
like an off-key siren song. Gretel, 
the main character who arguably 
did not deserve to be (more on 
that later), narrates in relentless 
second person, employs a relentless 
active voice and harnesses a tone of 
relentless accusation. The addressee 
of the second person narration 
and the tireless accusations is 
Gretel’s mother, who raised Gretel 
in poverty on a canal boat only 
to leave her daughter when she 
turned 16. Two-thirds of Johnson’s 
parallel sequences in “Everything 
Under” slogs through this fraught 
relationship: 
one 
chronicling 

Gretel’s search for her mother and 
the other capturing their continued 
dysfunctionality even after Gretel 
finds her.
For a short while, Johnson’s 
narrative 
techniques 
work, 
ensnaring readers in the anxiety, 
apprehension and resentment Gretel 
has felt since being abandoned. 
Soon enough, however, the sharp 
edge of Gretel’s narration dulls with 
overuse. What once read as rhythm 
now induces the flat, chronic pain of 
a headache. And once the headache 
sets 
in, 
Johnson’s 
borrowed, 
unremarkable observations (e.g. 
“Children are supposed to leave 
their parents … Parents are not 
supposed to leave their children”), 
for all their writerly flair, lose their 

disguise and their charm.
Midway through the novel, 
another story — that of Margot, 
Oedipus’s counterpart — takes 
over. 
Anesthetized 
by 
Gretel’s 
redundancy, not to mention the 
unwavering wretchedness of most 
every other character (especially 
Gretel’s mother) up to this point, 
readers may mistake this shift in 
favor of multidimensional character 
Margot for a breakthrough. Of 
course, it cannot last. Gretel has 
commandeered this story from the 

beginning, and it’s too late for a coup. 
This internal battle for control of 
the story and its unfavorable result 
illustrates the broader identity crisis 
stifling “Everything Under.”
One of Johnson’s tasks as the 
re-interpreter of a classic is to 
supply readers with a useful lens 
through 
which 
to 
re-examine 
the original story, one that offers 
new insights. It might be useful to 
imagine the re-interpreter as the 
optometrist and their readers the 
patients seated before the many 
lenses of the phoropter. It is the 
author’s job, in this instance, to help 
their reader see something new and 
see it clearly, which is why Margot’s 
arc stands out. In Margot’s story, 
Johnson 
reevaluates 
“Oedipus” 
through the lens of gender, and 
readers have a fresh encounter 
with the malleability of gender: 
Specifically, the ways gender can be 
weaponized, both in one’s favor and 
to one’s detriment. For the rest of 
the novel, Johnson struggles to pick 
an equally apt lens (motherhood, 
family and fate are attempted), and 
the dizzying confusion of lenses 
makes it nearly impossible to see 
anything else valuable in Johnson’s 
reinterpretation, compounding the 
reader’s headache.
A 
prominent 
innovation 
in 
Johnson’s retelling of “Oedipus,” 
likely spawned by her reliance on 
bewildering her audience in order to 
maintain their attention, is the canal 
thief. Or, as Gretel and her mother 
call it, the “Bonak”: a menacing, 
elusive beast that stalks, steals and 
commits murder along the canal on 
which they lived. 

When 
I’m 
asked 
about 
“Milkman,” what usually comes 
first is a facial expression. It’s 
unconscious, I think, involving 
a fusion of shock and delight 
— a raising of the eyebrows, an 
open mouth, a slight grin — and 
holding for only a brief moment 
before I get to a synopsis of the 
book that ends with an aggressive 
recommendation. 
For 
good 
reason, too: Irish author Anna 
Burns’s 2018 novel is increasingly 
popular. The novel beat out other 
favorites for the 2018 Man Booker 
Prize and has soared in sales in 
recent months.
These 
accomplishments 
of 
Burns’s are rightfully harvested. 
“Milkman” is, quite simply, an 
arresting masterpiece. Telling the 
story of a young woman planted in 
late-twentieth-century Northern 
Ireland, “Milkman” is a chilling 
story that Burns uses — both 
outstandingly successfully and 
covertly — as a lens to apply to 
the world readers interact with 
in “Milkman.” With prose so 
reliably detailed and engrossing 
and 
an 
audacious, 
yet 
still 
intricate, cast of characters, it is no 
question the Booker Prize fell into 
commendable hands.
It takes only a page or two of 
reading to realize that the cover 
of “Milkman” is deceptive. The 
binding of the 2018 winner of 
the Man Booker Prize depicts 

an innocuous, fluorescent-pink 
sunset — one of those once a year, 
stop-and-snap-a-photo 
sunsets 
that makes “Milkman” stands out 
among its fellow books.
The 
sedative 
lightness 
of the cover seems to admit 
innocuousness. But “Milkman” 
is not innocuous. Nor is it gentle, 
or quiet, or apologetic — nothing 
that the cover may suggest about 
a subdued, romantic narrative. 
To say I wasn’t excited to read 
the Booker winner would be a 
lie — based on the superficiality 
of covers and excerpts, I have 
rooted for “Milkman” since its 
nomination on the long-list — 
but 
the 
way 
I fell in love 
with 
reading 
“Milkman” 
was 
not 
in 
the 
pleasant, 
blushing manner 
I had expected. 
It was a cycle of 
shock, recoil and 
return.
Anna 
Burns’s 
third 
novel 
narrates the story of an 18-year-
old girl (referred to as “Middle 
Sister,” as none of the characters in 
“Milkman” are prescribed actual 
names) over the course of two 
months. Her unnamed town is 
saturated with violence — violence 
from the ubiquitously demonized 
enemy countries “over the water,” 
violence from the renouncers 
of the state that control Middle 
Sister’s 
town 
and 
violence 
from the state police as they 

intervene in a village of scattered 
revolutionaries. 
Surprisingly, 
though, this war-zone setting is 
but an offhand normality in the 
book. Instead, it is Milkman, a 
paramilitary that begins making 
unwarranted advances on Middle 
Sister, that takes the place of chief 
antagonist in the book.
At first glance, Burns lays out an 
invidious landscape that seems to 
hyperbolize the dark experience 
of growing up as a woman in the 
late 20th century. Maybe, Burns 
seems to suggest, the descent of 
society would look like this for all 
genders. But on second thought, 
the landscape Middle Sister walks 
— and how her 
hyperaware, 
rightfully-
paranoid 
thoughts congeal 
in it — becomes 
painfully 
real. 
Middle 
Sister’s 
encounters 
with 
Milkman 
while walking, her fears of being 
drugged, the pernicious comments 
coming from third brother-in-law, 
all resonate uncomfortably with 
the realties meeting women today.
This daring, critical kick at that 
experience of being a woman pays 
off. The apotheosis of the book’s 
dark and applicable portrayals 
is perhaps Tablets Girl, a “girl 
who was actually a woman,” that 
is one of the local outcasts in 
Middle Sister’s town due to her 
propensity to poison people. This 
usually takes place, most suitably 

and without retribution, in bars. 
People flee from Tablets Girl, 
people watch their drinks when 
Tablets Girl is around. It’s not 
just Burns’s clear allusion to date-
rape that that is to be appreciated 
here, but her spiked humor and 
exaggeration also.
This is not to reduce “Milkman” 
down to a forced, constricted 
focus 
on 
gender-politics 
though. Burns’s writing alone is 
remarkable (something I refuse 
to say passively). “Milkman” is 
brimming with endlessly long 
paragraphs, 
lose-your-train-
of-thought stretched sentences 
and digressing thoughts from 
Middle Sister that render the 
book 
incredibly 
complex. 
At 
first, I was perturbed by this 
formal and royal-esque writing, 
especially upon an encounter with 
a paragraph spanning four, almost 
five, pages. But as I continued, 
I found myself — in an unlikely 
way — reading Middle Sister’s 
voice in an uninterrupted pattern 
even more critical and translucent 
than I expected possible. This is 
assisted by Burns’s near-perfect 
draw of synonyms through the 
book, making her writing appear 
dependably careful and personal.
I 
was 
enamored 
by 
the 
characters in “Milkman” and the 
abrasive humor that was tacked 
onto them. It isn’t often that I get 
a full cast of characters (narrator, 
antagonist, family) that are so real, 
so exciting to encounter. Most 
memorable are the “wee sisters,” 
Middle Sister’s three younger 
sisters who, despite their young 
ages, are infatuated with topics 
such as French revolutionaries, 
going through “Kafka phases” and 
eavesdropping every moment they 
get. Characters like the wee sisters 
offer 
unexpected 
gratification 
along Burns’s dark timeline of 
events. The real humor displayed 
make “Milkman” all the more 
authentic and pleasurable.
I love “Milkman” because it is a 
fruitful attempt to offer me hints 
of a human experience I will never 
be able to understand, let alone 
be familiar with. Perhaps the 
most evocative and vivid account 
in the vein of social-rebellion 
and unwanted-gaze I have ever 
encountered, “Milkman” is a 
narrative that has been told 
repeatedly, even frequently in the 
21st century. Burns’s unequivocal 
writing turns this narrative into 
a fearsome chant, one well worth 
shouting along to.

The Man Booker Prize is 
about as coy and mysterious as 
the work it honors. The award 
was inaugurated in the UK 
in 1969 according to “just one 
criterion — the prize would 
be for ‘the best novel in the 
opinion of the judges’,” which 
you may recognize as the literal 
definition of “book award.” 
If you go to the Booker Prize 
Foundation for something more 
specific, you’ll learn that the 
aim of the prize is to “increase 
the reading of quality fiction” 
and 
“attract 
the 
intelligent 
general 
audience,” 
some 
very 
conventional, 
slightly 
pretentious 
ambitions. 
And 
then, somewhere along the line, 
the prize is casually promised 
to “transform the winner’s 
career.”
From 
a 
cynical 
eye, 
everything about this begs to 
be grilled: the near-satirical 
ambiguity, the slight air of 
superiority — all of it. The 
thing about the Man Booker, 
though, is that they pull it 
off, 
resoundingly. 
Although 
absent from their bare mission 
statement, the Man Booker does 
an excellent job of sniffing out 
innovative fictions: prose that’s 
perhaps a touch too edgy to sell 
in the mainstream and may 
just need a little £50,000 kiss 
for momentum. Consequently, 
the program has created and 
maintained 
an 
impressive 

cohort 
of 
now-household 
names in the world of literary 
fiction, absolute Gs like Salman 
Rushdie, 
J.M. 
Coetzee 
and 
Kazuo Ishiguro, whose work 
has challenged and tempered 
what we can do with language.
The Man Booker’s reputation 
for the slightly odd renders 
it 
a 
particularly 
exciting 
and unusual prize. Graphic 
novels, black comedies and 
“historiographic metafictions” 
have graced both long and 
shortlists, 
genres 
typically 
underrepresented in the world 
of 
literary 
accolade. 
This 
year’s 
winner, 
“Milkman,” 
follows the story of unnamed 
characters in the unnamed 
town of an unnamed country 
overrun with violence between 
unnamed political groups. Its 
author, 
the 
Northern 
Irish 
Anna Burns, plans to use the 
prize money on an operation 
to alleviate the intense nerve 
pain 
that 
complicated 
the 
release of “Milkman.” In an 
interview with The New York 
Times, Burns shared that “If it’s 
successful, I’ll be able to write 
again.”
The Booker Prize Foundation 
is using their power to promote 
and protect the weird, and we 
at The Michigan Daily Book 
Review are here for it. We’ve 
covered the shortlist for you: 
texts ranging from longform 
poetry noir to a psychological 
retelling of “Oedipus” on a 
houseboat — odd birds that 
might be the household names 
of the next decade.

You can learn a lot about 
“The Long Take” by studying 
its cover art. A grey and obscure 
photograph, in it a foggy night 
scene features a pair of roads 
sloping upward through lighted 
tunnels. Shadows play across 
the 
foreground 
and 
recede 
into the distance. Above, on 
a hill, elegant 1940s and ‘50s 
cars are lined up in a neat little 
row, at first unnoticed in the 
dark atmosphere but gradually 
coming to take on an outsized 
presence. Off-center, to the 
left, a solitary figure of a man 
stands on the medium, frozen 
in the act of lighting a cigarette 
under a burnt-out street lamp, 
silhouetted against the bright 
interior of the tunnel behind. 
As far as one can tell, he is 
completely, utterly, alone.
It’s a classic film noir shot.
Robin 
Robertson’s 
Man 
Booker-shortlisted 
“noir 
narrative” is difficult to pin 
down. At once it’s a novel 
and 
an 
extended 
narrative 
poem (or, in some tellings, an 
“epic,” whatever that means 
in our post-classical age). It’s 
simultaneously 
a 
nostalgic 
homage to and a critique of 
the film noir genre. It both 
romanticizes and recoils from a 
certain mid-century manner of 
portraying the world. Whenever 
you try to put your finger on 
exactly what it’s trying to say 
about any particular theme it 
seems to slip just out of your 
reach, leaving little more than a 

general impression and a sense 
of having been in the presence 
of something meaningful. This 
is both frustrating and enticing, 
and it’s only at the end of the 
book that things start to come 
together in such a way that you 
can say, “right, this is what it’s 
about.”
What it’s about is The City. 
And the traumas of war, and 
the isolating nature of pain, 
and homelessness and cars and 
ingratitude. But mostly The City.
There’s 
a 
moment, 
not 
too far into the story, when 
the protagonist, Walker — a 
returned 
and 
traumatized 
World War II veteran from the 
North Nova Scotia Highlanders 

— is interviewing for a job at the 
Los Angeles Press, making the 
case for why he’s a worthwhile 
person to take on.

“‘I’m interested in films and 
jazz. Cities,’
‘Cities?’
‘Yes. American cities.’ /
‘What about American cities?’/
‘How they fail.’”

This 
essentially 
sums-up 
Robertson’s own preoccupation 
in this book, which, more than 

anything, is about the particular 
way in which Los Angeles — the 
seat of glamorous Hollywood, 
the 
wide-open 
Western 
automotive paradise and the 
American Dream — functions 
as the god who failed. Though 
Walker alights briefly upon New 
York and San Francisco, it’s 
here, in the sprawling Southern 
California megalopolis that’s 
played host to so many noir films, 
that Walker carves out a place 
for himself in the bleak space of 
his postwar existence. Against 
the monochromatic smear of 
its grey and black palette, Los 
Angeles is already, in its relative 
infancy, showing the signs of 
corruption creeping up through 
the sun-cracked concrete.
Throughout the book abides 
this 
pervasive 
feeling 
that 
there’s 
something 
rotten 
at 
the core of America, a slow 
putrefaction eating away at 
its body, “an infestation, a 
carcinoma.” And postwar L.A. 
is the perfect setting to explore 
it, where it seems like the seed of 
this creeping disease is already 
germinating. After all, L.A. is 
only a stone’s throw away from 
the same Orange County that 
gave 
us 
then-congressman 
Richard Nixon, who peripherally 
appears in the book in his old 
trappings of a cold warrior, 
smiting Alger Hiss from the 
heights of his HUAC seat — and 
if America’s mid-century decay 
has an avatar, Tricky Dick is as 
good a candidate as any other.

Over the winter break, I was 
lucky enough to see “To Kill a 
Mockingbird” on Broadway. The 
script for this new production, 
which opened on Dec. 13, was 
written by Aaron Sorkin. It was an 
incredibly spellbinding experience, 
easily one of the best plays I have 
seen all year.
Jeff Daniels’s Atticus Finch 
was refreshing, in both ambiguity 
and strength, as Daniels managed 
to capture Atticus’s flaws and 
finer moments in this production 
without sounding overly preachy. 
Celia 
Keenan-Bolger’s 
Scout, 
furthermore, was quite convincing 
— she expertly straddled the 
boundary between child and adult, 
oscillating 
between 
adolescent 
memory and adult reflection.
As 
with 
many 
Broadway 
productions, 
especially 
those 
based on books of this stature, the 
production value behind the play 
was superb. The sets were great, 
the courtroom with empty jurors’ 
chairs in particular standing out in 
my mind. And while the music and 
lighting were not much to speak 
of, they perfectly underscored the 
childish simplicity of the narrative.
A little after attending the play, 
however, I began comparing it to the 
novel. In doing so, I became aware 
of many striking departures Sorkin 
took in this production — many of 
which seem to rob the story of its 
greatness.
Sorkin complicates Atticus, for 
example, painting him not as a 
perfect figure but as a flawed man 
working to do what he believes 
to be best. The best example of 
this comes in the middle of the 
play, as Sorkin adds a tense scene 
between Calpurnia and Atticus, two 
characters previously described as 
having a sibling-like relationship. At 
the height of this scene, Calpurnia 
accuses 
Atticus 
of 
muttering 
 
“you’re welcome” under his breath 
at her after taking on the case.
Atticus’s interactions with Bob 
Ewell are also quite different in this 
telling of the story. Ewell is now 
a virulent racist and anti-Semite. 
He claims that Atticus’s work as a 
lawyer must be an indication that he 
is secretly Jewish, and he criticizes 
Atticus among his white peers for 
this (alleged) Jewish ancestry.
Later, when Ewell comes to 
confront 
Atticus, 
they 
engage 
in a brief altercation. Unlike the 
Atticus of the movie and the novel, 
this Atticus does not refrain from 
engaging in this fight, which 
eventually culminates in Atticus 
pinning Ewell’s hands behind his 
back and holding him by his hair.

One of the aspects of Harper 
Lee’s novel that I have always found 
most compelling is the ambiguity 
that she brings to Southern race 

relations. Unlike many other novels, 
she portrays Southerners as neither 
entirely bad nor entirely good. 
Scout’s young age further enhances 
this narrative, as the reader is forced 
to confront early 20th-century 
race relations from the point of 
view of a naïve adolescent, losing 
any stereotypes that they may hold 
regarding these issues.
Sorkin, on the other hand, 
modifies the story to make it 
more acceptable to our Trump-
era left-wing prejudices. These 
modifications felt slightly cheap — 
unlike Lee’s novel, it felt as though 
Sorkin was giving the audience 
exactly they wanted, leaving in no 
ambiguity and provoking no higher-
level 
questioning 
surrounding 
Southern culture.
Sorkin deflects criticism of the 
“white savior” trope, for example, 
by 
adding 
the 
confrontation 
between Calpurnia and Atticus. 
To my great surprise, Atticus 
responded to this criticism by 
apologizing to Calpurnia — rather 
than demonstrating the flaws in this 
“white savior” trope, Sorkin takes it 
further, portraying Atticus as aware 
of his own prejudices though his 
actions seem to perpetuate them.
Atticus’s fight with Ewell was 
similarly flawed in my view. Though 
some may argue that this speaks to 
his flaws in terms of his inability 
to control his own emotions, I saw 
it instead as a cheap attempt at 
solidifying Atticus’s masculinity 
and strength. This was yet another 
instance in which Sorkin’s additions, 
rather 
than 
adding 
intriguing 
complexities 
to 
the 
narrative, 
merely served to create new flaws.
Just as with Atticus’s newfound 
introspection, I found Ewell’s anti-
Semitism to be a cheap attempt at 
pandering to modern sensibilities. It 
served no purpose in the narrative 
besides engaging further with 
modern audiences — a surprisingly 
surface-level 
reference 
to 
the 

resurgence of neo-Nazism.
If anything, Sorkin seems to be 
grasping for more prejudices that he 
can give to Ewell. It almost seems as 
though Sorkin thinks that Ewell’s 
initial racism wasn’t enough — that 
saying the n-word a couple of times 
and accusing a Black man of a crime 
he did not commit is not enough 
to provoke the audiences anger; 
that without this addition of anti-
Semitism, the audience might not 
despise Ewell to the proper degree.
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
Lee’s 
controversial 
sequel 
to 
“To 
Kill a Mockingbird,” “Go Set a 
Watchman,” chose to depict Atticus 
not as a slightly introspective savior-
like figure but as a deeply flawed 
and hypocritical man, a lawyer who 
spends his free time with racist 
individuals and engages in racist 
discussions even as he voluntarily 
defends a Black man in the South’s 
racist courts of law.
Though I was initially upset 
by this new novel, (as were many 
readers), this play served as a 
helpful reminder of the frightening 
yet powerful message that this book 
seems to send: that we all hold racial 
prejudices and that even a flawless 
pro bono attorney like Atticus can 
still hold deep racial prejudices. Lee 
destroys the idyllic Atticus in favor 
of the flawed, racist Atticus, forcing 
the reader to examine their own 
prejudices.
Sorkin’s play, however, instead 
reminded me of the pitfalls of our 
hyper-polarized cultural climate. 
We live in the supposedly “post-
racial” era, where a Black man could 
be elected to the presidency. Our 
entertainment is expected to reflect 
these post-racial attitudes, whether 
it be the criticism of Atticus or the 
addition of Ewell’s anti-Semitic 
prejudices. Lost in this climate, I 
fear, is the ambiguity and complexity 
that gives the performing arts their 
thought-provoking qualities.
This is not to say that Sorkin’s 
additions are not more culturally 
appropriate, or that they might 
not reflect a better, less-prejudiced 
society. But at the end of the day, 
they are not original to the text — 
they give the audience what they 
want to see instead of what they 
might be forced to see. But, as I have 
said before, the performing arts are 
not meant to comfort us, they are 
meant to challenge us. They should 
make us slightly uncomfortable. 
They should force us to confirm our 
prejudices, not confirm to us that 
we have overcome other people’s 
prejudices. And in this regard, 
unfortunately, Sorkin’s “To Kill a 
Mockingbird” fell flat.

SUSSMAN

Is it possible to achieve the 
environmental call to action 
of 
Rachel 
Carson’s 
“Silent 
Spring” in a work of fiction? 
Richard Powers is resolved to 
find out.
Powers’s “The Overstory,” 
which made it onto the 2018 
Man 
Booker 
shortlist, 
is 
his first attempt at literary 
environmentalism; 
it 
is 
reasonably 
and 
enjoyably 
successful. While the novel was 
not predicted to transcend the 
English prize’s shortlist, “The 
Overstory” remained a 2018 
favorite. The novel, clocking 
in at just over 500 pages, 
features a near-overwhelming 
eight central characters, the 
likes of which range from a 
Vietnam War veteran to a 
loveable patent attorney 
to 
an 
unruly 
college 
senior. 
The 
curvation 
of all eight stories are 
brought together (or at 
least near one another) 
over the course of the 
novel by trees — which 
appear 
spiritual 
and 
conscious, intervening in 
the characters’s lives and 
thoughts — when they sound a 
call to environmentalism.
The 
environmentalism 
that 
all 
eight 
characters, 
through 
varying 
spouts 
of time, succumb to, take 
disparate shapes. For Patricia 
Westerford, it is scientific 
research; 
for 
Nick 
Hoel 
and Mimi Ma, it is joining 
a 
radical 
environmentalist 
group working desperately to 
preserve trees still standing 
in the United States. When 
a sampling of the characters 
break the law in the name of 
the environment and things 
go unsparingly wrong, they 
are forced into shadows. The 
intensity of the story slowly 
defuses 
here. 
Implications 
ensue for some characters. For 

others, less so.
Powers is most heralded for 
his ability to capture such a 
large narrative arc in a novel. 
“He (Powers) would probably 
be Herman Melville of ‘Moby 
Dick’,” 
writes 
Margaret 
Atwood. “His picture is that 
big.” And yes, “The Overstory” 
is surely substantial. Not only 
does the novel incorporate so 
many characters, but Powers 
devotes generous prose to 
each, allowing for considerable 
backstory and development of 
psyches. This shines brightly 
in the first 150 pages. The 
introduction of each character 
— with each cast member 
consuming about 20 pages — 
is well paced, calculated to 
appear almost as separate short 
stories. Especially striking are 
passages about Adam Appich 
and Ray Brinkman. Powers 
details a blushing love story 

and 
a 
complex 
childhood 
that bring the novel to life 
for readers. These lengthy, 
brave introductions make the 
characters sticky and easy to 
form loving attachments.
This 
praised 
and 
intense 
narrative 
capacity, 
however, is also why “The 
Overstory” 
stumbles. 
Once 
the interweaving of the eight 
narratives begins, switching 
routinely between different 
characters’s 
perspectives, 
readers 
are 
left 
grappling 
for a central thesis or story 
to 
follow. 
Unfortunately, 
one is not found. It is too 
difficult to be moved by one 
event 
or 
character 
when 
these scenarios are merely 
glimpsed at, disregarded as the 

narrative flits to another plot. 
Thus, while the characters are 
well crafted upon exposition, 
they are left behind as Powers 
takes on too large an idea in 
too small a space.
Conceivably the only central 
body 
in 
“The 
Overstory” 
is 
Powers’s 
refrain 
of 
environmentalism. It involves 
trees, trees and more trees. 
This is certainly an interesting 
and narrow selection of plot to 
choose as the factor to propel 
a reader through a novel. At 
times, this environmentalist 
focus is interesting. Powers 
traces 
over 
wonderful 
descriptions of nature and its 
power, scientific prose about 
flora’s communicative traits 
and, of course, forces readers to 
glare head on at deforestation 
and, 
implicitly, 
climate 
change. However, there is 
little 
emotional 
investment 
here. It is perhaps easier 
to be moved by the 
activists themselves — 
in the small pieces of 
them readers see — than 
by the destruction of the 
environment. If there 
is something profound 
and new that Powers is 
trying to express in his 
work, especially with 
respect to environmentalism, 
it remains behind the curtain.
Despite its shortcomings, 
“The 
Overstory” 
probably 
deserved its place among the 
other shortlisted novels for 
the Booker Prize. The story is 
undeniably bold, undertaking 
(with 
moderate 
success) 
a 
fascinatingly broad narrative 
with a well-meaning cast of 
characters. Powers’s writing 
is clean and consistent, and his 
literary environmentalism is 
original and intriguing. Still, 
these feats subdue potential 
character intimacy and the 
novel fails to stand by a robust, 
explicit thesis. For a paradigm 
of these latter features done 
well, see the prize-winning 
novel, “Milkman.”

MUSIC VIDEO: ‘THE SEDUCTION OF KANSAS’

“It’s almost like the version 
of Priests that made Nothing 
Feels Natural really died,” D.C.-
based trio Priests are quoted 
as saying in a preview of their 
new album, The Seduction of 
Kansas. This death, which was 
followed by prompt rebirth, 
Jenn Pelly writes, came in part 
due to bassist Taylor Mulitz’s 
decision to devote himself more 
fully to his other project, Flasher. 
Priests seized the opportunity 
to reimagine themselves in a 
more poppy vein, also bringing 
in producer John Congleton, 
who has worked with artists 
ranging from Earl Sweatshirt to 
bands like Modest Mouse. The 
resulting sound, or at least what’s 
hinted at by “The Seduction of 
Kansas,” is something that not 
all listeners seem particularly 
thrilled about it, as evident from 
the comments on the YouTube 
upload of the music video and 
this thread on the r/indieheads 
subreddit.
To their credit, Priests 
anticipated the divisiveness 
of their new material. Back in 
Nov., vocalist Katie Alice Greer 
tweeted from the band’s account, 

“I don’t think these are the songs 
some of you will have *wanted* 
us to make, especially if you liked 
(Nothing Feels Natural) & just 
wanted (Nothing Feels Natural) 
2.”
In any event, to point to the 

band’s reorientation towards 
pop as evidence — or, worse, 
proof — that they have “sold 
out” is to miss the point entirely. 
“The Seduction of Kansas” is 
accessible but ominous and, 
lyrically, just as politically 
charged as 2017’s Nothing 
Feels Natural, if more vaguely 
poetic. In the song’s music 
video, Greer, drummer/vocalist 
Daniele Daniele and guitarist 
G.L. Jaguar dance across various 
ballrooms of a Victorian estate, 
sometimes pausing for close-ups 
in which they caress the busts of 

white men whom I presume are 
now dead.
We occasionally watch the 
video from an additional remove, 
as guests in a movie theater, 
able to see other seats lined up 
before the screen. As a direct 
tie-in, the song’s most biting 
lyric comes at the end of the first 
verse, when Greer sings, “It’s 
the last picture show, all the 
cowboys they get ready / For a 
drawn-out charismatic parody 
of what a country thought 
it used to be.” It’s a line that 
immediately calls to mind every 
instance that anyone, from a 
powerful politician to a stranger 
on Twitter, has said, “This is not 
what America stands for!” in 
the past two-and-a-half years, 
while also addressing the tired 
absurdity of it all. America has 
been up to all kinds of skeevy 
bullshit for as long as it’s been 
around, and Priests have always 
been — and still are — interested 
in putting the mindset that 
ignores that fact on blast.

Michigan faces test against Iowa

When 
the 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team 
enters 
Carver-Hawkeye 
Arena Thursday night, it 
will face one of the biggest 
challenges of Big Ten play, 
both literally and figuratively.
While 
the 
Wolverines’ 
(11-6 overall, 2-3 Big Ten) 
game against No. 23 Iowa 
(12-4, 3-2) could have major 
implications for their NCAA 
tournament fate, Michigan 
will face a big challenge 
on the court in the form of 
Megan Gustafson. The junior 
is 
currently 
the 
nation’s 
leading 
scorer, 
averaging 
26.4 
points 
per 
contest 
while also hauling in 12.9 
rebounds. 
Senior 
Hallie 
Thome, who is averaging 12.4 
points per game along with 
5.4 rebounds, will have her 
hands full with Gustafson, 
her likely assignment.
Even though the Hawkeyes 
— who average 80.6 points 
per game — have the edge 

in the scoring department, 
the 
Wolverines 
hold 
the 
upper hand on the offensive 
glass, which could be key to 
spurring an upset against a 
team that features a big as its 
focal point.
The Wolverines grabbed 18 
offensive rebounds in a loss 
at No. 9 Maryland last week, 
but were unable to seal an 
upset after turnovers turned 
a one-point fourth quarter 
deficit into a fourteen-point 
defeat.
“We typically turn the 
ball over way too much but 
I think we’ve gotten better 
at that throughout Big Ten 
play,” 
coach 
Kim 
Barnes 
Arico said. “A lot of the Big 
Ten teams … like to play an 
up-tempo paced game. It lets 
them get out and run and 
score easy buckets. So I think 
it’s twofold, we need to do a 
better job executing off the 
glass rebounds and then just 
not turning it over.”
While Thome will garner 
the most attention given her 
matchup 
with 
Gustafson, 

freshman guard Amy Dilk 
and freshman forward Naz 
Hillmon will be instrumental. 
Playing big minutes in their 
first collegiate season, the 
two have impressed at times, 
though their success has not 
been without bumps in the 
road.
“It 
really 
doesn’t 
slow 
down and become that easy 
until your junior season,” 
Barnes Arico said. “So we’re 
expecting a lot from a lot of 
young kids and I think they’re 
continuing to improve and 
continuing to buy into the 
process every day.”
Thursday’s game against 
the Hawkeyes provides a 
major 
challenge 
for 
the 
Wolverines, but that will 
be 
nothing 
new 
in 
one 
of 
the 
nation’s 
toughest 
conferences.
“The Big Ten is stronger 
than it’s ever been before,” 
Barnes 
Arico 
said. 
“Our 
league from top to bottom is 
just tremendous this year.”
On 
Thursday, 
Michigan 
will experience that in full.

A

fter 

Hayden 
Lavigne 
saved 30 of 
32 shots at 
then-No. 6 
Notre Dame 
on Jan. 5, 
one couldn’t 
help but think back.
At this point last season, the 
junior was locked in a battle 
for the starting goaltender job 
with Jack LaFontaine when 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
named Lavigne the full-time 
starter. And by this time, 
you’ve probably heard about 
how Lavigne and the Wolver-
ines caught fire in January 
and rode that momentum all 
the way to the Frozen Four.
This season, Michigan has 
looked like a Frozen Four-
caliber team at times, with 
dangerous skaters, versatile 
defensemen and two capable 
goaltenders in Lavigne and 
freshman goaltender Strauss 
Mann, who have started 12 
and 11 games, respectively. 
At then-No. 4 Ohio State and 
the Fighting Irish, the Wol-
verines — who entered the 
stretch ranked 28th in Pair-
wise — went into hostile road 
environments with everything 
on the line.
To its credit, Michigan went 
out and did Michigan things 
on those days, beating the 
Fighting Irish on a national 
stage and splitting with the 
Buckeyes, in no small part 
thanks to Lavigne’s play in 
those three starts.
Teams like Ohio State and 
Penn State can turn every 
matchup into a high-scoring 
track meet. Notre Dame wants 
to grind it out and let Hobey 
Baker award-winner Cale 
Morris and a stout blue line 
control the game.
But Michigan, despite its 
8-9-6 record, has remark-
ably proven that it can win 

both ways. At their best, with 
Quinn Hughes, Will Lock-
wood and Josh Norris, there’s 
no denying that the Wolver-
ines can keep up with any 
offense in the country. Mean-
while, senior defenseman 
Joseph Cecconi, freshman 
defenseman Nick Blankenburg 
and freshman forward Garrett 
Van Wyhe are the ones forcing 
turnovers, winning faceoffs 
and defensively out-grinding 
teams to make Lavigne and 
Mann’s job easier.
As the first three months 
of the season have shown, 
though, Michigan is also that 

rare team that can lose in 
many ways. The Wolverines 
can point to their 4-2 loss to 
Merrimack and blame it on 
Norris and Hughes being gone 
for World Juniors, but they 
convincingly beat a Notre 
Dame team 40 places higher 
than the Warriors just days 
before without the duo.
If Michigan, without its two 
best players, can completely 
stifle a team that went all the 
way to the NCAA Champion-
ship and beat Ohio State on 
the road when healthy, what’s 
the explanation for a three-
goal third-period meltdown to 
the Warriors?
The one commonality 
through those good and bad 
games? The revolving ques-
tion of who is — or isn’t — in 

goal.
“If you could bottle the 
effort in the victories, you’d 
be a billionaire,” Pearson said 
after the Wolverines’ 3-2 vic-
tory over Ohio State on Friday. 
“You’d sell it to every team 
just so they make sure your 
team comes out the same way 
and as hard every night ... I 
think we got a good wake-up 
call (last) Tuesday that you 
can’t take anybody lightly. 
Regardless of the record, the 
ranking, whatever it is, any 
team can beat you, especially 
if you don’t play up to your 
potential.”

The way for Michigan 
to solve all those questions 
involves it jumping off a deci-
sional cliff, and as it seems to 
be doing, start Lavigne for the 
long-haul again.
For every strong stretch 
that Lavigne and Mann have 
had this season, shuffling 
them around makes it that 
much harder for them to build 
on it.
It’s time to choose one of 
them, and squandering Lavi-
gne’s recent heroics against 
such tough foes could be a 
season-defining mistake.

C

hris 
Col-
lins 
stepped 
up to the 
podium last 
Sunday, 
faced with 
the unenvi-
able task of 
putting into 
words a 
summation 
of his team’s 80-60 loss to 
No. 2 Michigan.
“Seventeen teams have 
tried,” the Northwestern 
men’s basketball coach said. 
“And 17 have failed.”
That’s 17 postgame press 
conferences for the oppos-

ing coach, trying to grapple 
with what had just hap-
pened and finding some pos-
itive takeaway 
to tell report-
ers.
“You’re 
down 22 at 
half,” Collins 
said. “I was 
proud of our 
guys to not roll 
over. We came 
out in the sec-
ond half, we 
fought, made a 
couple runs, think we got it 
to 14 or so. … Hopefully that 
can be something good. Our 
young guys got a lot of expe-
rience.”

Michigan coach John 
Beilein, of course, down-
played the accomplishment. 
Beilein isn’t 
one to dwell on 
achievements 
— even when 
those achieve-
ments include 
a 17-game 
undefeated 
start, the best 
in program 
history.
Instead, he 
complimented 
the Wildcats. The game, he 
said, was closer than the 
score indicated and the Wol-
verines remained focused on 
the day-to-day. His words 

sounded far from those of a 
coach whose team had just 
achieved history. 
“Everybody 
would like to 
have me make 
some great 
statement 
about being 
17-0,” Beilein 
said. “It’s 
just another 
game.”
But maybe, 
Beilein didn’t 
need to make 
some sort of sweeping state-
ment about his team’s per-
formance. Collins’ words 
— that he was proud of his 
team for cutting the lead to 

just 14, that the young kids 
getting playing time was a 
big positive — already spoke 
volumes.
Sure, Collins’ 
Northwestern 
team isn’t very 
good. But he’s 
not the only 
one that has 
given similar 
soundbites.
Last week, 
coach Archie 
Miller took his 
No. 21 Indiana 
squad, featuring five-star 
freshman guard Romeo 
Langford and preseason 
All-Big Ten forward Juwan 
Morgan, to Ann Arbor. The 
Hoosiers lost by 11 instead 
of 20, but the 
overall out-
come was no 
different — 
just another 
team that 
had tried and 
failed to solve 
Michigan.
The first 
words of 
Miller’s post-
game presser? 
“Michigan did a great job.”
He concluded his open-
ing statement by saying, 
“They’re really good and I 
give them credit.”
There it was again, that 
the Wolverines were simply 
really talented and hard to 
beat. Sure, he nitpicked his 
team’s flaws like all coaches 
do, but it was all couched in 
the context of how a squad 
that good will put all your 
weaknesses on display.
Back in December, it was 
Purdue’s Matt Painter who 
found himself in a similar 
situation. The Boilermak-
ers, then ranked 19th in 
the country, had lost by 19 
points. He echoed the same 
refrains.
“You gotta give them 
credit,” Painter said. 
“They’re a good team.”
Then, he rattled off 

his team’s mistakes. Bad 
defense. A slow start. The 
list went on.
“When you’re not disci-
plined, they’re gonna get 
you,” Painter said. “They’re 
gonna get you anyways.”
Michigan is that team 
now. The one you can’t 
expect to give you any-
thing. The one that provides 
opposing players a good 
“learning experience.” The 
one that leaves coaches at a 
loss for words to the point 
where the only thing left 
to do is tip their hats to the 
Wolverines for being the 
better team.
When you’re 17-0, report-
ers inevitably ask how it 
feels. Beilein doesn’t bite, 
because that 
isn’t who he 
is. Instead, he 
undersells the 
team’s suc-
cess — pointing 
out the day’s 
impressive 
performances, 
talking about 
things to 
improve, then 
moving on.
Meanwhile, for the oppos-
ing coaches, the press con-
ferences are an exercise in 
futility, a laundry list of 
what went wrong. Then, 
inevitably, an acknowledg-
ment.
Give the Wolverines cred-
it. It’s hard to beat a team 
like that.
Unlike Beilein, these 
coaches don’t need to 
stretch to justify their com-
pliments. In fact, they don’t 
really need to justify them 
at all. The way Michigan 
has been playing speaks for 
itself.
And that makes a state-
ment louder than any 
Beilein himself could.

In his 12th season at Michigan, coach John Beilein leads a group that has won 17 games to open the season for the first time in the program’s history.

...the press 
conferences are 
an exercise in 
futility.

Sixteen coaches have tried and failed. They’ve all offered an iteration of the same: Michigan is just that good.

Notebook: Coaching hires, Gattis contract and offering a seventh grader

Minutes 
after 
Michigan’s 
Peach Bowl loss to Florida 
last 
month, 
a 
reporter 
asked 
Wolverines 
coach 
Jim Harbaugh whether he 
anticipated any changes to his 
coaching staff.
The 
answer, 
perhaps 
predictably, was a simple “no.”
Three 
weeks 
later, 
that 
prediction 
has 
proven 
incorrect, as Michigan has 
already seen three assistant 
coaching jobs change hands.
The 
Wolverines 
were 
unexpectedly thrust onto the 
coaching carousel on Jan. 7, 
when Greg Mattison — who 
had spent eight seasons in 
Ann Arbor, including the last 
four as defensive line coach 
— was hired as Ohio State’s 
co-defensive coordinator. Less 
than 24 hours later, Mattison 
was 
joined 
in 
Columbus 

by 
linebackers 
coach 
Al 
Washington, who left to take 
the same position with the 
Buckeyes.
After a week of uncertainty, 
Michigan 
has 
filled 
both 
holes, 
quickly 
replenishing 
its 
defensive 
coaching 
staff 
to 
the 
five 
assistants 
it 
had 
before 
Mattison 
and 
Washington’s 
departures.
The 
Wolverines’ 
first 
defensive 
addition came last week, when 
they 
hired 
Boston 
College 
co-defensive 
coordinator 
Anthony Campanile, as first 
reported by 247Sports and later 
confirmed by the University 
Athletic Department.
“Anthony 
has 
a 
strong 
reputation for developing all-

conference 
performers 
and 
future NFL players,” Harbaugh 
said in a news release. “Our 
student-athletes will benefit 
greatly from his mentorship. 
Anthony 
is 
an 
excellent 
addition 
to 
our 
coaching 
staff 
and 
provides 
great 
flexibility with 
his 
experience 
working on both 
sides of the ball 
and at multiple 
positions.”
Campanile 
worked as the Eagles’ defensive 
backs coach for the past three 
seasons, including one when 
Washington was there, after 
two as the tight ends coach at 
Rutgers. Michigan already has 
two defensive backs assistants 
— safeties coach Chris Partridge 
and cornerbacks coach Mike 
Zordich — meaning it could 

move 
Campanile 
to 
work 
with linebackers. Harbaugh 
could also opt to shift one 
of Partridge or Zordich, and 
assign Campanile to one of the 
defensive back groups.
Then, 
on 
Wednesday, 
247Sports reported that the 
Wolverines filled their second 
vacancy by hiring defensive 
line coach Shaun Nua from 
Arizona State. Nua spent the 
past season with the Sun Devils 
after five seasons at Navy, all as 
defensive line coach, making 
him a direct replacement for 
Mattison.
Now, 
three 
weeks 
after 
Harbaugh’s 
proclamation, 
the Wolverines may actually 
be done with their coaching 
changes. The one remaining 
void in the coaching staff is 
at wide receivers coach, after 
Jim McElwain left to become 
the head coach at Central 
Michigan before the Peach 
Bowl. 
However, 
Michigan 
is currently at its NCAA-
restricted 10-assistant limit, 
meaning any hiring would have 
to coincide with a departure or 
firing.
Gattis contract finalized
Michigan’s biggest offseason 
splash through three weeks has 
been its hiring of Josh Gattis 
from Alabama, where he was 
co-offensive coordinator and 
wide receivers coach. Gattis 
was hired as the Wolverines’ 
offensive 
coordinator 
and 
play caller — a first under 
Harbaugh, who had previously 
forgone a traditional play-
calling offensive coordinator.
Gattis has brought an air 
of excitement to Michigan’s 
offseason, promising a high-
flying modern offense, similar 
to what he left behind in 
Alabama.
Gattis’ contract, obtained 
by The Daily via a Freedom 
of Information Act request, 
runs three years with a base 
annual salary of $900,000, 
making him the Wolverines’ 
third-highest 
paid 
assistant 
after passing game coordinator 
Pep Hamilton and defensive 
coordinator Don Brown. He 
will also receive a signing 

bonus of $200,000 and could 
earn up to $400,000 per year in 
bonuses.
If Gattis leaves for another 
assistant coaching job before 
Jan. 10, 2020, he owes Michigan 
a $400,000 buy-out. That figure 
drops to $250,000 if he leaves 
between Jan. 10, 2020 and Dec. 
1, 2021. However, the buy-out 
will be voided if Gattis — who 
has never previously been a 
head coach — leaves for a head 
coaching job. The contract also 
permits him to freely interview 
with NFL teams.
Harbaugh offers seventh 
grader
One month after Michigan 
signed 25 players to its 2019 
recruiting 
class, 
Harbaugh 
extended another offer — this 
time to a quarterback who 
won’t graduate middle school 
until 2020, making him the 
first offer of the Wolverines’ 
2024 recruiting class.
Isaiah Marshall is just 13 
years old, making him the 
youngest recruit — and the 
second seventh grader — that 
Michigan has ever offered. 
He is the son of former 
Northwestern running back 
Brian Marshall, who currently 
coaches at Southfield A&T 
outside of Detroit.

“He’s pretty laid back and 
humble, we keep a controlled 
environment for the most part,” 
Brian told the Detroit Free 
Press. “He’s pretty grounded. 
My brothers and I have all 
played 
Division 
I 
football, 
we’ve been there. We have 
experience on our side. We 
control the social media thing.
“But I still remember the 
(recruiting) process. And we 
coach the kids through it now. 
He grew up watching Sam 
Johnson play high school and 
youth ball, he was the first 
middle school kid in Michigan 
to get an offer. So he’s seen the 
process. He’s not your normal 
kid when it comes to the 
distraction factor.” 
Because Marshall still has 
more than five years before he 
can graduate high school, this 
offer carries little practical 
meaning. 
The 
Wolverines 
offered 
linebacker 
Owen 
Pappoe — then an eighth 
grader — in 2015, but were not 
among his final choices when 
he ultimately committed to 
Auburn last month. However, 
it does show early interest and 
generate media and fan interest 
during a quiet time of year 
before National Signing Day in 
February.
