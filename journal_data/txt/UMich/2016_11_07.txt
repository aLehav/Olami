During the lead up to the 

presidential 
election, 
The 

Michigan Daily is polling students 
about campaign issues every two 
weeks. This is the fourth and final 
iteration of the survey. Overall, 
polling data can be seen here.

This week, the survey was 

sent to 1,000 University of 
Michigan students and received 
205 responses over a period 
of five days. The sample was 
chosen randomly from University 
undergraduate 
and 
graduate 

students and reported in the 
aggregate.

The majority of respondents 

Protesters threw beer and 

opened a can of pepper spray 
during a visit from former Alaska 
Gov. Sarah Palin’s (R) visit to 
the Town Pump Tavern in 
Detroit on Sunday night where 
she was slated to campaign for 
Republican presidential nominee 
Donald Trump and participate in 
an interview with Fox News’s Bill 
O’Reilly.

Palin was in Michigan as 

part of a series of stops in the 
state planned by the Trump 
campaign in the leadup to the 
election amid a tightening race 
in the state, which hasn’t been 
won by a Republican since 1988. 
Clinton currently leads by five 
points, according to an aggregate 
of polls, and has stepped up her 
presence in Michigan as well.

Shortly after Palin’s arrival at 

the Detroit bar, two men began 
to yell obscenities and anti-
Trump rhetoric before they were 
removed by the owner. According 
to an eyewitness, a woman threw 
beer on the bar owner while he 

was walking the men out of the 
bar.

“I 
saw 
two 
guys 
being 

dispersed 
while 
Palin 
was 

talking (to the crowd), and they 
were being put out by what 

I understand to be the bar’s 
owner,” the eyewitness said. 
“And then this woman who 
was sitting at the bar, who was 
drinking a beer, splashed it on the 
owner as he was escorting the 

men out. This caused him to react 
in a violent way — he threw them 
all out.”

Once outside, the two men 

continued to cause a disturbance, 

With campaign stops from both 

presidential candidates and their 
surrogates just days before the 
election, Michigan’s importance 
as a possible swing state in the 
presidential election has never 
been more apparent.

Both Democratic presidential 

nominee 
Hillary 
Clinton 
and 

Republican presidential nominee 
Donald Trump will hold rallies in 
the state on Monday. Additionally, 
Republican 
vice 
presidential 

nominee Mike Pence will campaign 
with Trump, and President Barack 
Obama will be in Ann Arbor in a Get 
Out the Vote rally for Clinton. Over 
the weekend, former president Bill 
Clinton stopped in Lansing and

LANSING — Sunday at the 

Lansing 
United 
Automobile 

Workers chapter, President Bill 
Clinton spoke to a crowd of 300 
in a bid to convince state residents 
that 
Democratic 
presidential 

nominee Hillary Clinton could 
create economic prosperity in the 
state .

Bill Clinton’s speech came 

just two days before the election 
and is part of a blitz of visits to 

Michigan from both Democrats 
and Republicans as the race in the 
state tightens, including a stop in 
Ann Arbor by President Barack 
Obama Monday.

Currently, Clinton is leading 

Republican presidential nominee 
Donald Trump in Michigan polls 
by a margin of 4.7 percent, but 
previously led by a 11.6 percent 
margin as late as Oct. 21, according 
to the RealClearPolitics polling 
average. A Republican presidential 
candidate has not won in Michigan 
since George H. W. Bush in 1988.

Bill Clinton told the crowd he 

believed Hillary Clinton would 
win Michigan easily in a normal 
election, 
but 
acknowledged 

Republican presidential nominee 
Donald 
Trump’s 
current 

momentum, tying it to frustrations 
about 
stagnating 
middle-class 

incomes after the financial crisis 
in 2008.

That 
economic 
stagnation 

has been a core part of Trump’s 
message, especially in typically 
blue states like Michigan with 
high proportions of blue-collar 
workers.

“It’s close to the elections 

and I believe Hillary will carry 
Michigan if we turn out — in a 
normal election, it wouldn’t be 
close,” Bill Clinton said. “We all 
know what’s going on, there’s a 
lot of road rage out there, because 
after the financial crash, it took a 
long time before income started 
going up again.”

In a bid to speak to that 

frustration, Bill Clinton noted he 
has been devoted to helping the 
middle class get ahead, especially 
during his time in office as 
president.

Students hoping to see President 

Barack Obama when he visits 

campus Monday to campaign for 

Democratic presidential nominee 

Hillary Clinton will first need to pick 

up tickets Sunday between noon and 

7 p.m. at the Ray L. Fisher stadium 

and on the Diag.

According to the campaign’s 

website, the public event will last 

from 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m Monday. 

Obama is slated to speak around 11 

a.m.

The University’s chapter of 

College Democrats, who were on 

the Diag distributing the tickets, 

also shared the event on their 

Facebook page, warning students 

than reserving tickets online would 

not guarantee them a spot for 

tomorrow’s event.

College Democrats chair Collin 

Kelly, an LSA junior, said Monday’s 

rally aims get voters in the state of 

Michigan excited and out to the 

polls.

“Getting out to vote is the most 

important thing for a Democrat 

to do,” he said. “So that is why 

President Obama is coming to 

Michigan, to get everyone energized. 

He is very very popular nationwide 

and especially in the state of 

Michigan.”

Kelley said Obama’s appearance 

in Michigan will bring more voters 

to the polls on Tuesday.

“His presence here is great and 

is a huge help to pump everyone up 

for our GOTV (Get Out The Vote) 

efforts on Tuesday,” he said. “It helps 

to carry the momentum throughout 

the campaign through election day.”

Obama’s visit, his third to the 

city during his presidency, comes 

one day before the general election, 

and is one of a multiple stops to 

campus made by high-ranking 

Clinton supporters. Both Sen. Tim 

Kaine (D-VA), the Democratic vice 

presidential nominee, and Sen. 

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) have visited 

campus recently to campaign and 

stressed the need for student turnout 

on Election Day.

It is also one in a series of 

visits to the state in the lead up to 

the election - Hillary Clinton will 

be in Grand Rapids Monday, and 

Bill Clinton is in Lansing Sunday. 

Republican presidential nominee 

Donald Trump’s campaign is also 

slated to have a heavy presence in 

the state in the last few days before 

the election - the candidate himself 

is in Sterling Heights Sunday and 

Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, the GOP 

vice presidential nominee, will be in 

Traverse City Monday.

Though Clinton currently holds 

a 5 point lead in Michigan and a 

Republican hasn’t won Michigan 

since 1988, her lead has tightened in 

some recent polls and Trump has 

consistently said he would like to 

flip the state. In a survey distributed 

by the Michigan Daily, 70.3 percent 

of student respondents on campus 

favored Clinton.

LSA freshman Jennifer 

Maiorana, who was waiting in line 

on the Diag for tickets, said she heard 

about the event through a friend’s 

Snapchat. Maiorana was her way to 

the baseball stadium, but stopped 

when she saw the College Democrats 

giving them out on the Diag.

“Just to see the President talk is 

an amazing opportunity,” she said. 

“I am really excited to see what his 

perspective is on this election since 

it is so polarizing and just kind of a 

great opportunity here on campus.”

LSA freshman Kailan Metha 

and LSA freshman Nikita Bazaj 

both said they heard about the event 

through word of mouth.

“I always have been a huge fan 

of Obama,” Metha said. “This may 

be my last chance to see him and 

this election coming up is really 

important.”

Bazaj also said she was a 

supporter of Obama.

“I didn’t think I’d ever get the 

chance to see him, so this is a great 

opportunity on this campus,” she 

said.

Hundreds gather at state Capitol 
to support Standing Rock protestors

In a display of solidarity, attendees support North Dakota Sioux tribe

The smell of burning sage and 

the sound of ceremonial drum 
beats filled the air around the 
roughly 500 supporters that 
gathered in front of the Michigan 
State Capitol building in Lansing 
Saturday at a protest against the 
construction of the Dakota Access 
Pipeline.

The protest was a display of 

solidarity for the Standing Rock 
Sioux tribe, who are protesting 
the Dakota Access Pipeline, a 
1,200-mile-long shale oil pipeline 
project slated to run underneath 
the Missouri river. Members of 
the tribe have argued that the 
pipeline threatens to contaminate 
the river, the tribe’s primary 
source of drinking water.

Last Monday, many University 

of Michigan students “checked 
in” to the Standing Rock Indian 

Reservation Facebook page to 
show their support for those 
protesting the development. On 
Saturday, some students, such as, 
like LSA senior Noor Ahmad, also 
attended the rally.

Ahmad said she joined the rally 

because supporting the rights of 
indigenous people is an important 
issue for her, and she chose to 
show solidarity.

“I came here to support 

indigenous 
resistance 
and 

indigenous autonomy, and to 
support the fact that people 
travelled here from all over 
Michigan to show their support 
for Standing Rock,” she said. “We 
are here to learn, we are here to 
listen and we are here to support 
in any way that we can.”

Ahmad said she travelled 

out to Standing Rock over Fall 
Break with other students who 
felt there was a limited quantity 
of mainstream media coverage 
on the issue, which has become 

heated in recent months.

According to a recent article 

by The New York Times, violence 
reported from both sides reached 
a high point last week, with 
at least 142 protesters being 
arrested on Oct. 28 for allegedly 
engaging in a riot and conspiracy 
to endanger by fire and explosion.

Several speakers at the Lansing 

rally Saturday encouraged peace, 
and at one point called for police 
standing by on the Capitol 
grounds to join a ceremonial circle 
dance that included everyone in 
attendance of the event.

Kerry Herron, a mother from 

Mount Pleasant and member of 
the Saginaw Chippewa Indian 
Tribe, said escalating tensions at 
the protest site have made it too 
dangerous for families to take 
their young children.

“I know when it first started, 

people were taking their kids out 
there and showing them what 
is going on, but with the police 

showing the force that they 
are, and attacking peaceful 
protesters, it’s not safe to take 
your kids out there anymore,” 
she said.

To draw attention to the 

protests in Standing Rock, 
Ahmad and a group of other 
students 
said 
they 
were 

there to conduct interviews 
and 
gather 
information 

to produce a zine, a short 
magazine-style 
work 

containing information about 
the Standing Rock Sioux tribe 
and the DAPL issue. The 
group plans to use the zine to 
collect donations to support 
the protest effort.

Saturday’s 
rally 
was 

organized 
through 
a 

collaborative 
effort 
of 

grassroots 
activists 

statewide, according to lead 
organizer Regis Ferland, a 
Mount Pleasant resident and 
member of the Canadian 
Mohawk nation. Several tents 
and tables were set up on the 
Capitol building grounds to 
provide more information

Ypsilanti resident Orin Kennedy and his family examine fossils from the Bristle Mammoth at the University of 
Michigan Museum of Natural History Saturday.

MUSEUM FINDINGS

in this iteration of the survey 
continued to identify themselves 
as Democrats, at 54 percent, 
with 
students 
identifying 

as Republicans forming less 
than half of that at 19 percent. 
Remaining 
respondents 

identified as Independent, Green, 
other or had no identification.

In comparison to previous 

Daily 
polls, 
more 
students 

identified 
themselves 
as 

Democrats or Republicans rather 
than third party supporters. 
Students continued to follow 
a national trend of millennials 
overwhelmingly 
supporting 

Democratic nominees.

When 
asked 
who 
they 

would vote for given the choice 
of 
Democratic 
presidential 

nominee 
Hillary 
Clinton, 

Republican presidential nominee 
Donald 
Trump 
and 
third-

party 
candidates 
Libertarian 

presidential 
nominee 
Gary 

Johnson 
and 
Green 
Party 

presidential nominee Jill Stein, 
76 percent said they would 
vote for Clinton — a 6-percent 
increase for Clinton since the 
most recent polling on Oct. 26.

LSA senior Lauren Gallagher, 

president of Students for Hillary, 
wrote in an email interview that 
she thinks student voice can be 
a powerful determinant in this 
election.

“Compared 
to 
other 

generational blocks, millennial 
turnout is typically extremely 
low, but, with that being said, 
we’ve seen in past elections how 
powerful the student voice can 
be,” Gallagher said. “Big name 
surrogate visits to our campus is 
the campaign sending a message 
that our voices matter, that the 
decision about what direction 
this country is headed in is up 
to us. It’s my hope that students 
don’t take this lightly and turn 

out tomorrow, it’s our future’s 
that are on the line right now.”

Support for Trump remained 

the same at 13 percent while 
support for Johnson and Stein 
continued to drop, with support 
for Johnson dropping 7.3 and 
support for Stein dropping 2.4. 
The majority of respondents 
were confident Clinton will win 
the election, at 87 percent.

In response to Clinton’s high 

unfavorability among the general 
public, Gallagher said she has 
seen passion and excitement for 
Clinton among fellow students 
and hopes that the narrative of 
the “millennial problem” will be 
a thing of the past.

“We value a leader who 

supports 
the 
rights 
and 

potential 
of 
all 
individuals, 

regardless of their race, gender, 
religion, nation of origin, sexual 
orientation, or socio-economic 
background,” 
Gallagher 
said. 

“Clinton 
is 
the 
progressive 

choice in this election, her vision 
for the United States is a country 
that continues to build on the 
diversity that makes us great, 
not take us back to a time where 
divisions hindered our progress.”

However, plurality of students 

responded that this election 
season only had a moderate 
influence on their confidence 
in the Democratic process at 30 
percent. The rest of the responses 
were polarized, with respondents 
saying it had either a lot of 
influence on their confidence or 
none at all.

This presidential race has 

set itself apart from previous 
campaigns in that the two 
major 
candidates 
are 
the 

most 
unpopular 
in 
election 

history 
after 
beating 
out 

multiple 
competitors 
during 

the primaries. In addition to 
the general unfavorability of 
the candidates, many incidents 
throughout the campaign have 
left not just students but the 
general 
population 
stressed 

about 
the 
outcome 
of 
this 

election.

47 percent of respondents also 

said they view Clinton favorably 
or very favorably rather than a 
neutral stance or dislike for the 
candidate. 38 percent also said 
they were neutral when asked if 
they were excited at the prospect 
of a Clinton presidency.

In comparison, 76 percent 

of respondents said they had a 
strong dislike for Trump, and 76 
percent also said they were not 
enthused at the prospect of a 
Trump presidency.

For 86 percent of respondents, 

this is their first time voting in a 
presidential election. Capturing 
first-time voters has been a 
major push in this election as 
millennials now outrank baby 
boomers as the largest generation 
and thus the largest voting 
electorate. Especially for the 
Clinton campaign, convincing 
millennials to both vote for 
her and participate on Election 
Day has been a large part of her 
campaign, with President Barack 
Obama and Sen. Bernie Sanders’s 
(I–Vt.) making visits on her 
behalf to college towns including 
Ann Arbor. 

Despite low support from 

University students, Michigan 
as a whole is at play and has 
been 
frequented 
heavily 
by 

both campaigns. LSA junior 
Enrique Zalamea, President of 
College Republicans, said that 
he believes this could be the first 
time since the election of George 
H. W. Bush in 1988 that Michigan 
could cast its electoral votes for a 
Republican candidate. 

“Clinton’s campaign manager 

Robby Mook described how 
Michigan has gotten so close 
it can now be considered a 
battleground 
state,” 
Zalamea 

said. “With the incredible uptick 
in Republican campaign speakers 
across Michigan, I truly believe 
that this election may be the first 
time since 1988 that Michigan 
may vote red.”

“I’ve now spent half my life 

trying to help people get a job, 
get a pay raise, save a business, 
save a farm, get a business loan, 
get health care for their kids,” 
Clinton said. “It’s what I’ve done 
with my life.”

Several speakers highlighted 

Michigan’s auto manufacturing 
industry in particular, a key 
component 
of 
the 
state’s 

economy. Several years ago, amid 
the recession, multiple large 
automakers in Detroit declared 
bankruptcy and were bailed 
out by the federal government. 
Unemployment 
in 
Michigan 

reached 14.9 percent in 2009, 
though it has shrunk considerably 
since.

Former Michigan Gov. James 

Blanchard (D), who introduced 
Bill Clinton, criticized comments 
Trump has made about the 
decline of auto manufacturing. 
Blanchard said Trump’s view of 
the state of auto manufacturing is 
inaccurate, citing a recent record 
number of auto sales.

“We’re dealing with many 

people who have an alternate 
view of the truth,” Blanchard 
said. “For example, a few weeks 
ago, (Trump) stood out here and 
said ‘manufacturing is a disaster 
in Michigan’ … that same week 
we announced record auto sales 
in the United States of America.”

Blanchard 
added 
that 
he 

thought life for workers during 
Bill Clinton’s presidency was 
much better than the view 
Republicans paint.

“When 
Bill 
Clinton 
was 

president, 
the 
Republicans 

have said it was a difficult era,” 
Blanchard said. “They are playing 
the American people for suckers: 
When Bill Clinton was president 
we had 24 million new jobs.”

Echoing 
Blanchard’s 

sentiment, Clinton acknowledged 
manufacturing 
workers’ 

frustration 
after 
the 
2008 

financial crisis He reminded the 
crowd that his time in office was 
one of the only times in history 
when income rose.

“When I was president, it’s 

the only time in 50 years when 
we all rose together; the bottom 
20 percent’s income increased in 
percentage terms, even more than 
the top 20 percent,” Clinton said. 
“It was the first time since the 
advent of trickle-down economics 
when we grew the economy from 
the middle out and the bottom 
up.”

Clinton added that he thought 

Trump’s rhetoric of anger and 
division would only lead to 
greater hurt for the middle class.

“I spent a lot of time doing 

this. It worked out pretty well for 
you when I was there,” Clinton 
said. “I actually believe that 
answers are better than anger, 
that empowerment is better than 
resentment, that cooperation is 

better than endless conflict.” 

He also charged that Trump’s 

policies would be regressive and 
would lower taxes for the wealthy 
and 
corporations, 
contrasting 

them with Hillary Clinton’s plan 
to create jobs through investment 
in infrastructure.

“What we need is first to create 

a lot more jobs that pay above 
average wage,” Bill Clinton said. 
“We need a major infrastructure 
program. Flint, Michigan is not 
the only place in America that 
needs new water pipes.”

Speaking to Trump’s tax plan, 

he said the businessman would 
cut taxes on big business, enabling 
business owners, while Hillary 
Clinton would impose penalties 
on businesses that unnecessarily 
move manufacturing jobs out of 
the United States.

“(Donald Trump) wants to 

cut taxes for all corporations; 
(Hillary Clinton) says not so fast,” 
Bill Clinton said. “I would not cut 
taxes on people who are making 
money and they leave the country 
anyway, I would raise them … I 
wouldn’t let them send stuff back 
to America.”

Expressing 
confidence 
in 

his wife’s record, Clinton said 
he was confident the economy 
would strengthen under a Hillary 
Clinton presidency.

“I have been knowing this 

woman a long time,” Bill Clinton 
said. “She has never touched 
anything she did not make 
better.”

Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R) visited 
Detroit.

The high number of visits from 

candidates the day prior to the 
election is somewhat unusual 
considering polls in Michigan have 
consistently shown Clinton beating 
Trump and the state has not voted 
for 
a 
Republican 
presidential 

candidate since 1988.

Communications 
Assistant 

Prof. Josh Pasek said a few weeks 
ago, following the presidential 
debates and scandal surrounding 
the tape recording of Trump 
using lewd language speaking 
about women, that Michigan 
would not have been in play, but 
due to the renewed Clinton email 
investigation, the race in Michigan 
is much closer.

“That shifted the map back in 

many respects to where it had 
been before the debates,” he said. 
“From that perspective it is not too 
shocking that Michigan is in play 
because, given what we expect 
in a traditional election between 
Democrats 
and 
Republicans, 

Michigan would be in play.”

Pasek said he thinks one of the 

main reasons the candidates are 
hosting rallies in the state so close 
to Election Day is the lack of early 
voting opportunities. Michigan is 
one of 16 states that does not offer 
no-excuse early voting, which 
Pasek said means candidate visits 
just prior to the election have a 
greater impact.

“Those states are much more 

dependent on the vote on Election 
Day than any other vote that 
happens before,” he said. “So 
attempts to sort of reach out in 
Michigan and Pennsylvania in 
particular right before the end 
have a chance to make a particular 
impact.”

Pasek said for both candidates, 

the state of Michigan’s electoral 
vote is essential to securing victory.

“If Hillary Clinton wins in 

Michigan, she is basically locked 
in to win, save the possibility that 
Pennsylvania goes the other way,” 
he said. “But if Trump wins it then 
he has a pretty good chance at 
getting into this race.”

LSA junior Collin Kelly, chair 

of the University’s chapter of 
College Democrats, wrote in an 
email interview with the Daily that 
though he believes the surrogate 
visits indicate the prominence of 
Michigan in this election, Michigan 

will still support Clinton.

“Michigan is a blue state — it has 

been solidly Democratic for the past 
two decades — and we don’t think 
that will change,” he wrote. “The 
amount of surrogates in Michigan 
just 
signifies 
how 
important 

Michigan is to the election, but 
the polls have been consistently 
favoring Secretary Clinton and we 
do not expect the results to be any 
different.”

According to Pasek, the main 

motivation for candidates this close 
to the election is to encourage those 
who support them but are less 
enthusiastic to actually get out and 
vote. Additionally, young people 
traditionally have low voter turnout 
rates and tend to lean toward 
Democratic candidates.

Pasek said, given the popularity 

of Obama, he has a notable ability to 
encourage students to vote, which 
would benefit Clinton.

“There is a substantial goal 

around trying to mobilize a bunch 
more students to try to vote than 
might do so otherwise,” he said. 
“Sending Barack Obama in, who 
is very popular among the student 
body, is probably a really good 
surrogate move in terms of trying 
to wring some more voters out of 
the student community.”

immigration, according to the 
Detroit News.

“In two days, we are going to 

win the great state of Michigan,” 
he said. “We will stop the jobs 
from leaving your state.”

Statewide polls previously 

gave Clinton a comfortable lead 
in Michigan, but the most recent 
averages by RealClearPolitics 
place her only five points ahead 
of Trump.

Clinton’s drop in the polls 

came at the same time new 
information was disclosed by 
FBI Director James Comey nine 
days ago investigating possibly 
classified emails that could 
have included some of Clinton’s 
emails. This information was 
released 
during 
a 
separate 

investigation of former U.S. 
Rep. Anthony Weiner, who is 

married to top Clinton aide 
Huma Abedin. Sunday evening, 
however, Comey published a 
new letter declaring the FBI 
found no criminality in the new 
emails, reaffirming the FBI’s 
verdict in July exonerating 
Clinton 
of 
any 
criminal 

behavior.

Nonetheless, 
Trump 
still 

continued to criticize Clinton 
on the email issue Sunday night.

“It’s a totally rigged system,” 

he said. “You can’t review 
650,000 new emails in eight 
days. You can’t do it, folks.”

Trump 
also 
criticized 

incoming 
refugees 
and 

immigrants. 
25 
percent 
of 

Sterling 
Heights 
residents 

were born in another country, 
according to The Detroit News, 
and Michigan was the top 
destination for Syrian refugees 
as 
of 
August, 
NBC 
News 

reported.

“Here in Michigan, you’ve 

seen firsthand the problems 

caused 
with 
the 
refugee 

program,” 
Trump 
said. 
“A 

Trump administration will not 
admit any refugees without the 
support of the local community 
where they are being placed.”

Trump’s visit comes amid a 

flurry of last-minute campaign 
events in Michigan by both 
major party candidates. Donald 
Trump Jr. will be in Detroit and 
Warren on Monday on behalf of 
his father, while Trump Sr. will 
make a last stop in Grand Rapids 
in his campaign’s last official 
rally.

Democratic 
presidential 

candidate Hillary Clinton is 
also focusing her efforts on 
Michigan. Surrogate President 
Barack Obama will be in Ann 
Arbor today alongside Chelsea 
Clinton, while Clinton herself 
will be at Grand Valley State 
University in Grand Rapids on 
Monday afternoon in her first 
visit to western Michigan in the 
presidential race.

to those interested in donating or 
committing to traveling out to the 
protest site.

“Our two main goals are to get 

bodies out there to North Dakota 
from Michigan and to gather 
supply donations, and then I guess 
there’s a third aspect too and that’s 
to get the word out there” he said. 
“There are still people who don’t 
know what’s going on out there.”

Ferland said they didn’t have an 

exact number of committed names 
of those interested in joining the 
efforts in North Dakota, but said 
he has personally spoken with 
about 100 people who expressed 

interest.

“We have had probably 30 

people who were like, ‘I’m not 
even waiting for the rally. I’m 
heading out so get ready for us at 
the host tent,’ ” he said.

He added that he returned to 

Michigan to galvanize support 
for the protests because he has 
seen a decrease from the 8,000 
protesters who were at the site this 
summer.

Several people in the crowd 

expressed their commitment to 
travelling out to North Dakota, 
including Zahra Ahmad, a senior 
at Central Michigan University 
who said she and five other 
students who are planning on 
raising money to take supplies 
with them to the Standing Rock 
site.

“A big part of it is that we just 

want to deliver that money to 
them, we want to show them that 
we are standing with them, that 
CMU is supporting them,” Ahmad 
said.

Madison Clayford, a CMU 

junior who is a member of that 
group, said they are raising money 
for heating equipment rather 
than a more traditional clothing 
drive because they were told 
by organizers that was lacking 
among the protesters.

“One of the challenges that 

people face is probably the cold, 
and that’s where the generators 
come in to keep people warm,” she 
said. “We were initially thinking 
about doing a coat drive but they 
said ‘Do not send clothes,’ they 
have more than enough. ”

knocking on the windows and 
yelling Palin’s name, prompting 
her to respond directly.

“I wish you had the guts to 

come in here and say that to my 
face,” she said to the protesters 
through an open window.

The 
direct 
engagement 

between Palin and the protesters 
led several patrons to leave the 
establishment and confront the 
protesters. One man at the event, 
according to the eyewitness, used 
pepper spray.

“The guys who were put outside 

were beating on the window, 
and some guys went outside,” 

the eyewitness said. “Then the 
protesters were trying to come 
back in but then the next thing I 
knew there was pepper spray. Me 
and the rest of the people sitting 
near the door couldn’t breathe all 
of a sudden. Of course the man was 
trying to spray it at the protesters, 
but the wind took it back inside.”

Shortly thereafter, two police 

officers arrived at the tavern and 
dispersed the protesters. Palin 
then conducted the interview in 
front of a small crowd of about 50 
supporters without further issue.

Palin also made stops in 

Cheboygan, Alpena and Midland 
during the weekend.

In her interview for “The 

O’Reilly Factor,” Palin said she 
was confident in Trump’s ability 
to win Michigan given the state’s 

industrial history.

“There is no reason why 

(Trump) wouldn’t win here,” Palin 
said. “There are these ‘Reagan 
Democrats’ here, these blue-
collar, hard-working Americans 
here. Maybe they are registered 
as Democrats, but they so want 
these positive changes for their 
businesses and for that industry to 
be ushered in.”

Palin 
also 
voiced 
her 

ambivalence toward polls, which 
show 
the 
Clinton 
campaign 

maintaining their statewide lead.

“As I’ve said before, Bill, polls 

are only good for strippers and for 
cross-country skiers,” Palin said.

Following her interviews, Palin 

left the Town Pump Tavern after 
shaking hands and taking photos 
with supporters.

Clinton calls wisely on Obama to deliver speech

R

acist, misogynistic, idiotic, 
corrupt, 
conniving, 

demonic. These are just a 

sampling of the colorful adjectives 
I’ve heard used to describe 
the major party nominees for 
president of one of the oldest and 
most powerful democracies on 
the planet. 

Such 
a 
vitriolic 
campaign 

has 
fractured 
the 
partisan 

divide into a gaping chasm, with 
many 
conservatives 
denouncing 

Democratic presidential nominee 
Hillary Clinton as a criminal, 
and many liberals condemning 
Republican presidential nominee 
Donald Trump as an orange-tinted 
Hitler wannabe. A veritable cascade 
of scandals has left about 60 percent 
of voters viewing both Trump and 
Clinton unfavorably and has even 
discouraged many from casting a 
vote at all. The grueling campaign 
has especially disillusioned young 
voters: 9 percent are still undecided 
about a candidate. Considering 
young people must live with the 
next president’s actions the longest, 
sitting out the election isn’t an 
option. Despite both candidates’ 
low favorability, I implore any 
politically disheartened college-
aged peers to vote for the only 
rational choice: Hillary Clinton.

Voting 
matters. 
In 
our 

republican system, casting a vote 
can influence the course of citizens’ 
lives for years to come. To willingly 
forgo voting is to throw away a 
voice and waste the opportunity 
to be a voice for those within this 
country unable to vote, including 
children, those without citizenship 
and those silenced by often racially 
motivated 
voter 
identification 

laws. Whoever takes office in 2017 
will have a dramatic impact on the 
rights of minority groups, college 
affordability, national security, the 
environment, education, health 
care and much more. In addition, 
the next president may be in office 
for as long as eight years, enough 
time for a current 20-year-old 
to cycle through a few jobs, get 
married and have a child. Given 
that the next president’s policies 
have the potential to shape my 
generation’s most formative years, 
this election is much too important 
for young people to sit out. 

Part of this election’s importance 

stems from the president’s ability 
to nominate future Supreme Court 
justices. Because of Justice Antonin 
Scalia’s death and the advanced age 
of many current justices, the next 
president could appoint three or 
more justices. I cannot overstate the 
significance of these appointments: 
A liberal-majority court versus a 
conservative-majority court would 
likely rule very differently when 
confronted with cases concerning 
LGBTQ 
equality, 
religious 

freedom, gun reform, women’s 
reproductive 
rights, 
financial 

regulation of corporate America 
and immigration. Trump runs on a 
platform promising to nullify court 
decisions protecting a woman’s 
right to choose and marriage 
equality for gay and lesbian couples.

Trump also promises to appoint 

justices committed to protecting 
gun rights against even moderate 
reform. In stark contrast to Trump, 
Clinton 
would 
likely 
appoint 

justices 
who 
support 
LGBTQ 

and women’s rights and are more 
critical of the financial sector’s 
excesses. Withholding a vote in 
the face of a Trump-appointed 
Supreme Court represents tacit 
approval of the legal subjugation of 
the marginalized, corporate greed 
and needless gun violence. Don’t 
throw away the opportunity to 
legally ensure a safer and more 
equitable country. 

A vote on Nov. 8 is also a vote 

between 
two 
different 
visions 

of 
the 
country’s 
approach 
to 

diversity. Trump’s policies mirror 
his well-known racist rhetoric. 
On immigration, Trump plans to 
erect a wall spanning the entirety 
of the United States-Mexico border 
and detain and deport anyone 
entering the country illegally. He 
also plans to temporarily cease all 
immigration into the United States 
from countries with “a history of 
exporting terrorism” and require 
aspiring 
immigrants 
to 
take 

ideological tests before entering 
the country. Moreover, Trump has 
stated that the Black Lives Matter 
movement incites racial violence. 
In contrast to Trump, Clinton 
promotes an easier pathway to 
citizenship and plans to introduce 
comprehensive immigration reform 
legislation within 100 days of taking 
office. She also plans to combat 
mass incarceration and police racial 
profiling. Clinton’s vast superiority 
on matters of diversity and racial 

justice means not voting represents 
tacit approval of Trump’s racist 
vision for America.

The candidates could also have 

profound effects on the future of 
the planet itself. Climate change’s 
potentially 
cataclysmic 
effects 

harm the youngest generations the 
most. Though this issue will persist 
long after the next president leaves 
office, the impact of Trump or 
Clinton’s environmental decisions 
will span centuries. Trump has 
stated he believes climate change 
is a myth created by the Chinese 
and plans to scrap the Clean Power 
Plan designed to reduce carbon 
emissions. Clinton endorses the 
Clean Power Plan and hopes to 
reduce carbon emissions by up 
to 30 percent by 2025 through 
expanded use of renewable energy 
and reduced consumption of fossil 
fuels. The coming generations 
most 
harmed 
by 
climate 

change don’t have a vote in this 
election, so it’s up to the present 
generations to elect leaders who 
take this threat seriously.

Donald Trump and Hillary 

Clinton champion dramatically 
disparate visions for this country’s 
future and I believe it’s highly 
unlikely for a voter to find both 
platforms 
equally 
unfavorable. 

Libertarian presidential nominee 
Gary Johnson and Green Party 
presidential nominee Jill Stein 
exist 
as 
options, 
but 
their 

likelihood of victory leave only 
Trump and Clinton as serious 
candidates. I have presented just a 
small sampling of the issues people 
who refrain from voting effectively 
ignore. Though many voters may 
find both candidates personally 
unappealing, one of them will be 
elected Nov. 8 and their policies 
will have a colossal impact on all 
citizens in the years to come. I 
believe any rational person would 
agree Clinton’s vision for America 
would be vastly more welcoming 
and prosperous than Trump’s.

So for your own sake and the 

sake of the country, I urge any 
discouraged voters to carefully 
research the possible futures for 
the United States on the ballot and 
cast a vote for Hillary Clinton this 
upcoming Tuesday.

Why passing the RTA plan is a must

MAX LUBELL | COLUMN

ith the ability to 
boost the regional 
economy, create major 

conveniences and improve the 
region’s transportation 
infrastructure, 
expansion 
of 
the 

Regional 
Transit 

Authority is arguably 
the most important 
piece 
of 
local 

legislation 
on 
the 

ballot in Southeast 
Michigan. The case 
for regional transit has 
a plethora of no-cost 
arguments that make 
it an absolute necessity to vote 
yes on the approval of the RTA 
master plan.

The 
Regional 
Transit 

Authority 
master 
plan, 

if 
approved, 
will 
expand 

bus transit lines, create an 
affordable 
airport 
express 

service, increase senior citizen 
paratransit services and create 
a rail line connecting Ann Arbor 
and Detroit, while other types 
of transit will connect these 
two cities to Dearborn, Wayne 
and Ypsilanti. The transit plan 
will 
create 
seamless 
travel 

between counties and suburbs 
in the region, many of which are 
currently unconnected by any 
means of public transit.

The lack of regional transit in 

the status quo creates a massive 
barrier to regional employment 
opportunities. It leaves many 
without a means of transporting 
to major suburban job centers. 
Today Southeast Michiganders 
live 
farther 
away 
from 

employment opportunities than 
before the collapse of the auto 
industry. Lack of regional transit 
in Southeast Michigan has a 
direct effect on these barriers 
and the lack of employment 
opportunities. Voting yes on the 
RTA’s master plan can change 
that, creating transit options that 
link these employment centers 
with potential employees. This 
plan, when implemented, will 
be incredibly useful for business 
owners, who will gain a reliable 
source of employment that pulls 
from an increased population 
of people who have access to 
reliable transportation to and 
from work.

What’s more, the expanded 

transportation system will also 
contribute to bringing in new 
types of employment. Successful 

mass 
transit 
will 

attract 
young 
and 

educated workers to 
the region. Empirically, 
cities with extensive 
public transportation 
become 
more 

attractive to educated 
millennials, 
thus 

importing a productive 
sector 
for 
the 

workforce. Connecting 
suburban areas, along 

with more urban centers such as 
Detroit and Ann Arbor, can create 
this effect for the region. The 
increase in employment options 
will have a critical impact on the 
local economy.

Increased public transportation 

will directly increase employment 
options, which in turn grows the 
regional economy. The major 
critics of the transit authority 
come from those opposed to the 
increased tax that comes with it. 
The plan would create a 1.2-mill 
tax that will cost the average 
household $95 per year. For some 
in the Macomb and Oakland 
county areas, the tax increase 
is perceived as unrewarding, as 
the transit opportunities will not 
directly impact them. I believe 
these arguments are nonsensical 
and unfounded.

The 
regional 
economy 

boost, caused by the increase in 
employment, would justify the 
tax increase no matter where 
one lives in the region. For every 
dollar invested into the transit 
system there will be a $4 return 
on investment. Such logic makes 
the tax increase a no-cost option 
for the region.

The major critiques of the 

RTA master plan all seem to 
come from the same line of 
reasoning: 
Individuals 
who 

will not be connected to or will 
not use public transit believe 
regional transit will not be 
beneficial for them. There are 
several reasons this line of 
reasoning is unfounded. The 
economic 
boost 
makes 
the 

proposed 
RTA 
master 
plan 

beneficial to everyone, even in 
counties not directly connected 

to the transit lines. The millage 
will also be advantageous for 
business owners, even if they 
do not personally use public 
transportation 
— 
reliable 

transportation 
is 
often 
a 

requirement for employment, so 
the expanded transit options will 
make more people employable.

Dispelling 
the 
economic 

arguments, public transportation 
is also a major convenience. 
Imagine having a rail line to take 
you to the airport or major city 
centers without hassle. Perhaps 
car culture is so ingrained in the 
common American that the idea 
of using public transit seems too 
far-fetched. If so, then that is 
the exact reason we need public 
transit: to eliminate the car 
culture mentality that makes so 
many regions inaccessible for 
citizens without reliable access 
to a motor vehicle. 

The boost to the local economy 

makes the proposed RTA master 
plan a sensible and no-cost 
option. Voters should consider 
not only the logical benefits to 
the transit authority’s master 
plan, but also the way we want 
our region to look. Transportation 
infrastructure 
is 
crumbling 

throughout the nation. Michigan 
can be seen as a staple child for 
the 
country’s 
transportation 

problems, and our public transit is 
an excellent example of that. 

Do we want our region to be one 

with a crumbling public transit 
system, where demand for public 
transportation 
to 
employment 

sectors 
drastically 
outweighs 

the supply of transit options? 
Do we want to live in a region 
where residents have to remain 
unemployed simply because they 
don’t have a way to get to work? 
Do we want to live in a region 
where we force a resident to walk 
21 miles every day traveling 
to their job and back home? 
Well, that is the region we live 
in now, but voting yes on the 
proposed 
Regional 
Transit 

Authority master plan would 
provide the opportunity to 
change that and improve our 
region for everyone.

Barack Obama will make his

campaign for Hillary Clinton. 
The campaign hopes a capacity 
crowd of 4,000 will be in 
attendance at the University of 
Michigan’s Ray Fisher Stadium 
to witness the president’s closing 
argument for Clinton before 
voting begins Tuesday morning.

No Republican presidential 

candidate since George H. W. 
Bush in 1988 has won the state 
of Michigan, but Clinton’s once 
double-digit lead has narrowed 
significantly in the past week. 
Clinton currently enjoys a five-
point lead in the state, according 
to 
the 
RealClearPolitics 

average of recent polls. This 
mirrors the most recent FOX 2 
Mitchell Poll of Michigan that 
was released Sunday. Despite 
this solid edge, Clinton’s lead 
isn’t 
insurmountable 
and 

the campaign of Republican 
presidential nominee Donald 
Trump has some reason to be 
optimistic. He easily dispatched 
of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) 
during the March primary by 
12 points, while Clinton was 
unexpectedly defeated by Sen. 
Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) 50-48.

All polling heading into the 

Democratic primary 
showed 

Clinton 
comfortably 
ahead, 

and Trump hopes a similar 
undervote exists for him in 
Michigan during the general 
election. His message on free 
trade and outsourcing resonates 
with many Michigan voters 
and the campaign has pinned 
its hopes of a comeback victory 
by 
turning 
Michigan 
red. 

Numerous surrogates and a wave 
of advertisements blanketed the 
state this last week; Trump has 
even scheduled a concluding 

rally 
in 
Grand 
Rapids 
for 

late Monday night. President 
Obama’s popularity and positive 
experiences in the state make 
him the ideal surrogate for 
Clinton 
— 
a 
well-received 

speech from him could help her 
cross the presidential finish line.

While 
Clinton’s 
approval 

ratings are dragging because 
of questions surrounding her 
honesty and trustworthiness, 
President Obama is enjoying 
some of the best polling numbers 
of his presidency as he prepares 
to leave office. Fifty-four percent 
of Americans now approve of 
the job he’s doing as president, 
according to a recent CBS/
New York Times poll. Similarly, 
Gallup finds his job approval 
rating at 53 percent. President 
Obama has also experienced a 
tremendous amount of political 
success in Michigan, carrying 
the state by 16 points in 2008 and 
9.5 points in 2012.

President 
Obama 
is 
no 

stranger to giving a terrific 
speech, but explicitly reaching 
out to millennial voters is the 
most important thing he can 
accomplish on Monday. Clinton 
currently leads Trump among 
this 
critical 
demographic 

group by over a 2-1 margin, 
but millennials are notorious 
for inconsistently turning out 
to vote. Only 46 percent of 
this group voted in the 2012 
election and Clinton is hoping to 
significantly raise these numbers. 
Because Michigan doesn’t have 
early 
voting, 
ensuring 
that 

millennials are highly motivated 
to turn out could determine 
which candidate wins the state. 
President Obama is especially 
popular with younger voters, as 
his job approval rating is over 
60 percent with this crowd. 
Being the father of two teenage 
daughters enables him to further 
connect with this target audience 
and a college campus will 
provide the perfect backdrop for 
the president to lay out his final 
case on Clinton’s behalf.

In addition to the fate of 

Michigan’s 16 electoral votes, 
President Obama’s legacy is 
also on the line during what is 
likely his last visit to Ann Arbor 
as 
commander-in-chief. 
The 

fate of the Affordable Care Act 
and several signature executive 
orders will be determined by 
the outcome of the election. 
A Clinton victory would be 
perceived in many ways as a 
third term for his administration 
and validation of his presidency. 
This adds an additional layer 
of pressure to the speech, and 
Michigan will no doubt be the 
political epicenter of the nation 
on Monday.

A 
Democratic 
candidate 

hasn’t visited the state this 
late in the election cycle since 
John Kerry in 2004. Reince 
Priebus, Republican National 
Committee chairman, said this 
weekend that if Trump wins the 
state of Michigan, “it’s all over.” 
An unexpected victory here 
could leave a fatal crack in the 
Clinton blue firewall and enable 
a path for Trump to accumulate 
the 270 electoral votes needed 
to be president. The Clinton 
campaign and its chairman, 
John 
Podesta, 
are 
publicly 

expressing 
confidence 
about 

prevailing in Michigan, but 
the dearth of early voting has 
injected uncertainty into the 
race and is certainly the cause 
of so many late high-profile 
visits to the state. President 
Obama has been dispatched to 
ensure that there will not be 
another major political upset 
in Michigan this year. He 
has an excellent track record 
delivering under pressure and 
there is no other surrogate 
Clinton 
would 
rather 
have 

making her closing argument to 
voters given the magnitude of 
the moment.

“What do you mean you didn’t like ‘Because the Internet’?!”

After an incredible first season, 

the FX critical darling “Atlanta” 
is still hard to describe. It’s not 
enough to call it a coming-of-age 
story about chasing fame, success 
and the American 
dream 
in 
the 

Southern 
hip 

hop 
scene. 
With 

Donald 
Glover’s 

unconventional 
brand of comedy 
and Hiro Murai’s 
meticulous 
direction, 
each 

of the show’s 10 
episodes showcases 
a surrealist vision 
of the Georgian capital through 
the eyes of Earnest “Earn” Marks, 
his cousin and on-the-rise rapper 
Alfred “Paper Boi” Miles (Brian 
Tyree Henry, “Vice Principals”) 
and Paper Boi’s trusted sidekick, 
Darius (Keith Stanfield, “Short 
Term 12”).

But even then, “Atlanta” is a 

program so strange and mystifying 
that perhaps Glover calling it 
“Twin Peaks with rappers” is the 
closest concrete description of the 
show. That four-word synopsis 
is illustrated especially in the 
show’s season finale, “The Jacket,” 
which manages to make the most 
mundane 
of 
situations 
seem 

compelling and thought-provoking.

After a crazy night out with Paper 

Boi and Darius, Earn wakes up in a 
trashed mansion and searches for 
his missing blue bomber jacket. 
We’ve seen Earn wake up in an 
unfamiliar environment before, 
both in the teaser trailer for the 
show and in the penultimate 
episode “Juneteenth.” But while 
this visual motif represents his 
aimlessness, it also shows Earn’s 
lack of a place to call home. Where 
does Earn actually live? Is he just 
constantly 
couch-surfing? 
He 

isn’t allowed to stay at his parents’ 
house, and he occasionally crashes 
at his on-and-off again girlfriend 
Van’s (Zazie Beetz, “Easy”) place 

in order to co-parent their baby 
daughter.

Following D.R.A.M.’s hit jingle 

“Broccoli” during the episode’s title 
sequence, Earn wanders on a quest 
to find the jacket and attempts to 
retrace his steps, checking Paper 
Boi’s Snapchat story and a nearby 
strip club for clues. The majority of 

the episode’s humor 
comes during these 
sequences, 
with 

Earn 
watching 

his 
drunk 
self 

on 
Snapchat 

and 
awkwardly 

describing 
who 

might 
have 
the 

jacket to a stripper 
seeking 
a 
guest 

appearance 
in 
a 

Paper 
Boi 
music 

video. 

He seeks help from Paper 

Boi and Darius at their outdoor 
couch spot, a sly visual reference 
to their first meeting in the pilot 
episode. During their conversation, 
Darius drops some of his typically 
unexpected words of wisdom: 
“If we spent the time we spend 
thinking 
about 
not 
spending 

money and spent that time on 
spending money, then it’d be time 
well spent.”

It’s a line that’s not only 

hilarious and well-delivered, but 
also serves as another reminder 
of the show’s offbeat asides and 
how captivating Darius is as a 
supporting character. Right before 
that statement, though, Darius 
makes an odd comment about how 
Black people’s number one problem 
is that they don’t know how to 
have fun. “I really disagree with 
that being Black people’s number 
one problem,” Earn replies with a 
flabbergasted look on his face.

Later, Earn makes a phone 

call to his Uber driver from the 
previous night during a three-
minute long take that incorporates 
a variety of intriguing aesthetic 
choices: telephoto lens, soft focus 
and most importantly, dynamic 
sound design. The sound aspect 
of the scene might not be crucial 
or even necessary, but Paper Boi 

and Darius’ off-screen dialogue 
maintains an authenticity that 
most other TV shows and even 
films ignore.

Fortunately, Earn is able to get 

his jacket, but Paper Boi and Darius 
need to drive him to a specific 
destination. They arrive in an all 
too-quiet neighborhood until a 
SWAT team suddenly appears 
to intercept them and a shootout 
occurs in a disquieting sequence, 
both for its violence and its casual 
attitude toward that violence. But 
even in its most affecting moments, 
“Atlanta” ’s dark humor is still 
present, as Earn uncomfortably 
attempts to retrieve the jacket from 
the shooting victim.

Seeing Earn in dark spirits, Paper 

Boi offers him his five percent of 
their income in a subtly sweet scene 
between the two. Things continue 
to look up for Earn as his friend 
retrieves and returns the jacket 
to him, but as it turns, what Earn 
really needed was a mysterious 
key inside the jacket’s pocket. 
After another brief but beautifully 
intimate sequence, this time with 
Van, Earn walks to an unknown 
location to the beat of OutKast’s 
“Elevators (Me & You),” a fantastic 
music choice that matches both the 
atmospheric mood and recurring 
theme of fame in “Atlanta.” In 
the final minutes, Earn opens up 
a dimly lit storage space with the 
mystery key and lies on a couch, 
staring at the two $100 bills in his 
hands. He may not have a place to 
call home, but this is the closest 
Earn has come to having some form 
of financial and emotional stability.

That 
particular 
moment, 

punctuated by Big Boi and André 
3000’s lyrics, is small yet pivotal 
in Earn’s journey to making 
something out of his life, whether 
it’s taking care of his child, being 
a manager for a hip hop artist or 
finding meaning in the dreamlike 
metropolis that is Atlanta. “The 
Jacket” may not have been a very 
climactic finale and it leaves 
many questions unanswered, but 
“Atlanta” remains one of this year’s 
most remarkable TV shows and 
that’s as best as I can describe it.

STYLE REVIEW

Parisian fashion houses like 

to be inclusive just about as 
much as fish like fishermen. 
Luxury brands function to 
financially 
nudge 
out 
the 

working class citizen; some 
will go so far as to burn their 
merchandise rather than sell 
it at a semi-affordable price 
point. 
However, 
in 
recent 

history, 
Parisian 
fashion 

houses are beginning to ditch 
their only-the-richest attitude 
in 
favor 
of 
collaborating 

with mass-market retailers. 
Isabel Marant partnered with 
H&M in 2013 to debut a more 
palatably priced collection. 
Two 
years 
later 
Balmain 

followed in suit. Most recently, 
on 
November 
3, 
Parisian 

fashion 
house 
KENZO 

launched their collection in 
collaboration with H&M.

The collection debuted to 

a website crash. The server 
could not support the trove of 
fans salivating at the thought 
of wearing a KENZO piece, 

both kidneys intact. Those who 
wanted to own a piece from the 
collection had to wait in line — 
and many did. Some dedicated 
frugal fans, with stars in their 
eyes (perhaps, in part, from the 
dizzying-kaleidoscopic nature 
of the collection), queued in 
front of stores well over 12 
hours before the doors actually 
opened.

Was the wait worth it? 

Check 
their 
shopping 
bag. 

The 
collection, 
while 
well 

representative of the brand, 
was 
not 
consistent. 
Some 

pieces were excellent, others 
far from it. Kenzo stayed true 
to 
their 
acid-trip-jungle-

adventure aesthetic; the pieces 
were just as vibrant and print-
heavy as always. The prices 
were tamed, the looks were 
not. The designers, Carol Lim 
and Humberto Leon, played 
with now ubiquitous trends, 
like exaggerated ruffles and 
prairie-inspired 
designs, 
in 

novel ways. As a result, many 
pieces were equal parts cool 
and cutting edge. Those less 
inclined to adopt high-fashion 
aesthetics were not ignored. 

The brand made sure to pander 
to its streetwear fans with 
some simple, yet eye catching, 
sweatshirts and hats.

But among the dynamic, 

fashion forward pieces sure 
to allure thrifty fashionistas 
lurked looks that seem better 
suited for another, younger, 
crowd. 
Some 
pieces 
were 

astoundingly juvenile — they 
look as if they were pulled 
straight off the body of the 
punkest kid on the playground. 
Throw on a “Yo Gabba Gabba 
hat and you’ve got yourself a 
cohesive look. The combination 
of inexpensive textiles with 
electric print proved fatal in 
many pieces. Some pieces are 
so youthful they’re practically 
unwearable. 
Fuzzy 
animal 

print, 
in 
conjunction 
with 

pattern and color mixing, is 
harder to pull off if you’ve 
passed 6th grade.

While the collection housed 

many dynamic pieces, it was 
not as strong as H&M designer 
collaborations of the past — but 
that won’t stop you from seeing 
KENZO x H&M litter your 
local streets.

This is your posture when the stress of a million nations is placed on your shoulders.

For Michael Moore’s (“Where 

to Invade Next”) latest, a sneak 
attack film released only 11 days 
after being filmed, Moore travels 
to 
Wilmington, 

Ohio— the singular 
town 
in 
Clinton 

country with that 
overwhelmingly 
favors 
Trump. 

Once there, Moore 
performs 
a 
one-

man show that feels 
like a cross between 
stand up and a TED 
talk: the sort of 
thing ripe with the kind of sound 
bites that flood Facebook feeds.

If you came to this movie—

as I did—expecting a dig into 
the core of Trump’s evil or a 
profile of his supporters or an 
examination of his rise to power, 
you’ll be disappointed. This isn’t 
a documentary about Trump. 
And aside from some disjoint 
quotes that open the film, it isn’t 
about his supporters either. It 
is rather a love letter to Hillary 
Clinton.

The 
biggest 
surprise 
of 

“Trumpland” 
is 
just 
how 

unsurprising 
it 
is. 
Moore 

is perhaps the tamest he’s 
ever been. He’s far from the 
provocateur he normally is, 
despite a subject material that 

feels so ripe for provocation. It’s 
odd, and a little disappointing. 
There’s even a hint of tenderness 
in Moore’s voice when he tries—
almost earnestly—to empathize 
with Trump supporters. The 
supporters in particular that 
he addresses are those of the 

upper mid-west, 
the 
Michigan, 

Ohio 
and 

Pennsylvania 
former 
middle 

class who were 
hit most hard by 
the automobile 
industry 
crisis 

and 
2008 

recession. 
His 

analysis of their 

support is one of a few moments 
in the film that feels like a small 
revelation, even if it’s prior 
knowledge.

Moore stands on stage, for 

the entirety of his performance, 
in front of large black and white 
photographs of young Hillary 
Clinton. It’s sweet and a little bit 
weird; as is the ode he spins to 
her in the latter half of the film. 
Despite its oddities, the picture 
he paints of her is—to quote from 
Moore’s 1996 book “Downsize 
This!”—one of a “shitkickin’ 
feminist babe.” He understands 
her enough to understand her 
flaws, her stoicism and her 
patient rise to the top. He draws 
comparisons to Pope Francis 
and FDR. He plays a sound clip 

of her graduation address to 
her classmates at Wellesley, in 
which her message is clear, but 
her voice shakes, as if to prove 
her humanity.

“Trumpland” is very much 

like a standup special in that it 
has a sort of “you really had to 
be there” quality to it. Moore is 
funny, but his humor requires 
the supplement of an audience. 
It’s exactly the sort of thing that 
can’t make you laugh out loud if 
you watch it alone.

What 
“Trumpland” 
might 

suffer from (and I cannot believe 
I’m going to actually say this) 
is a lack of Trump. The film 
premiered in New York on 
October 18 at the same time the 
news of the Trump tapes was 
breaking and blowing up. Of 
course Moore could not know 
then what we all know now. But 
in light of that news it seems 
odd not to use that platform to 
condemn him. 

And it’s just that oddity 

that’s the problem with this 
entire election. Why can’t we 
elect Hillary Clinton because of 
her merits, her qualifications, 
her passion, her goodness and 
not because of her opponents 
evils. What Moore uncovers, 
almost 
accidentally, 
is 
that 

even without Trump as her foil, 
Hillary holds her own as one of 
the most resilient, companionate 
and badass figures in modern 
politics.

TV REVIEW
FILM REVIEW


I 

watch a lot of TV. This is old 
news. Sometimes, though, 
my obsession with keeping 

up with TV gets unhealthy, 
particularly when I’m unwilling 
to quit a show I don’t even like 
anymore.

It’s “The Walking 

Dead.” 
“The 

Walking Dead” is 
what 
I’m 
talking 

about.

Critic Matt Zoller 

Seitz 
calls 
“The 

Walking 
Dead” 

an example of the 
“Bad 
Relationship 

Show, 
taking 

its 
audience 
for 

granted or treating 
it like garbage for weeks, then 
doing or saying something that 
momentarily makes you think the 
series is delivering on its promise, 
only to backslide quickly and 
become ostentatiously mediocre 
again.”

I’ve stayed committed to far too 

many Bad Relationship Shows. 
I watched all eight seasons of 
“Dexter” and all six seasons of 
“Glee,” two shows that repeatedly 
sprinkled hints of potential in 
their later, bad seasons, only to 
fail at delivering on that promise. 
When Debra (Jennifer Carpenter, 
“Limitless”) 
from 
“Dexter” 

discovered her brother’s secret 
at the end of the sixth season, the 
show impressively depicted the 
fallout, giving her the agency to 
break off her relationship with 
Dexter (Michael C. Hall, “Six Feet 
Under”) — only to lionize him 
and slaughter Debra’s character 
development with an ill-advised 
quasi-incest plot.

“Glee” 
was 
the 
ultimate 

example of this pattern, waffling 
between promising and abysmal 
so rapidly it induced whiplash. 
Rachel (Lea Michele, “Scream 
Queens”) 
and 
Kurt’s 
(Chris 

Colfer, “Struck by Lightning”) 

move to New York 
briefly 
revitalized 

the show with a 
new 
setting, 
but 

the new characters 
back home were left 
in the dust when it 
came to interesting 
storytelling. 
Subsequent seasons 
featured countless 
plots 
that 
went 

nowhere, and yet 
I 
kept 
watching; 

it felt wrong to invest so much 
time in the show only to stop 
five years in. I thought, at least, 
that the show would end on a 
high note, recovering with an 
emotional 
series 
finale 
that 

made you remember the show in 
its prime; that’s what happened 
with “The Office.” Nope. It was 
bad.

“The Walking Dead” is the most 

prominent show in pop culture 
that fits this mold, still getting 
huge ratings despite its repeated 
violation of the audience’s trust. 
The fourth season was a recovery 
season of sorts, and the fifth 
season was by far the best of 
the show’s whole run. Then the 
sixth season happened, and I got 
burned worse than ever.

Enough think pieces have been 

written at this point, so I don’t 
need to explain why the latest 
“The Walking Dead” premiere 
was so bad. I’ll just say that after a 
horrifically bad season finale last 
year, a lot would have to be done 

to earn back my goodwill, and the 
premiere did not do that. It was 
more of the same, and it should’ve 
been the straw that broke the 
camel’s back. I should’ve just 
made the definitive decision to 
stop watching.

And then the second episode 

aired, and it was pretty good. The 
new character of Ezekiel (Khary 
Payton, 
“General 
Hospital”) 

instantly established himself as 
the most interesting one on the 
show — at this point, most of the 
main cast has far outstayed their 
welcome — and the episode had 
a surprisingly hopeful message, 
with a healthy dose of levity and 
a refreshing element of surreality. 
(Ezekiel leads a community called 
the Kingdom, reigning as a “king” 
with a CGI tiger at his side).

To be clear, I don’t think 

this means the show’s going to 
actually continue on its upward 
trajectory. “The Walking Dead” 
has done this countless times, 
and I have no faith that it’ll 
suddenly improve and stay good 
for more than a couple episodes 
at a time. There’ll be some decent

close to breaking me. As Zack 
Handlen from The AV Club said, 
the ideal way to watch the show 
is to “Enjoy the moments, but 
don’t necessarily expect them 
to add up to anything more than 
themselves.”

Part of me knows, though, that 

even if the show gets to a point 
where I don’t enjoy any of the 
moments — even if every episode 
is dull, pseudo-philosophical, and 
unrelentingly, mundanely grim — 
I’ll probably still keep watching. 
That’s the burden of the hopeless 
completist.

Mel Gibson returns to 
top form with ‘Hacksaw’

Subversive war film puts Andrew Garfield through hell

FILM REVIEW

Mel Gibson’s films ordinarily 

treat violence as a symbol of 
passion. William Wallace leads a 
bloody revolution for the freedom 
of Scotland in “Braveheart.” 
Jaguar Paw must 
kill his captors to 
return to his wife 
in 
“Apocalypto.” 

Jesus is tortured 
and crucified to 
save his followers 
in “The Passion 
of 
the 
Christ.” 

With that in mind, 
it’s strange that 
Gibson 
would 

choose a project in which the 
main character shows his passion 
through 
staunch 
peace 
and 

nonviolence. That’s not to say that 
“Hacksaw Ridge” isn’t a violent 
movie, but Gibson utilizes the 
violence here to sharply contrast 
with Desmond Doss’s (Andrew 
Garfield, “The Amazing Spider-
Man”) vow not to take a life. He 
tells the story of a man surrounded 
by darkness who refuses to let 
it consume him, and injecting it 
into a film with a perfect cast and 
action set pieces that are nothing 
short of incredible.

As jaw-dropping as those war 

scenes can be, the opening scenes 
of the film, which paint a picture 
of Doss’s upbringing, are just as 
powerful; the audience witnesses 
the poignant evolutions of the 
relationships and ideals which 
come to define Doss through 
the war. As he does for most of 
the film, Garfield carries these 
scenes with a charm that could 
have been grating had it not come 

across as so incredibly earnest. 
There’s never a moment when 
it seems like he’s deliberately 
overplaying a certain part of the 
character for effect, whether in 
his scenes opposite Teresa Palmer 
(“Lights Out”), with whom he 
shares adorable chemistry, or 
in his scenes with his father 

(Hugo 
Weaving, 

“The 
Matrix”), 

which are nothing 
short of quietly 
devastating. 
As 

Desmond’s PTSD-
stricken 
father, 

Tom, 
Weaving 

gives one of the 
best 
supporting 

performances 
of the year as he 

portrays a man completely broken 
by war and killing who doesn’t 
want the same fate to befall his 
sons. He’s a hard man, and the 
film doesn’t excuse his behavior, 
but Weaving manages to make 
him one of the most sympathetic 
characters.

Once Doss leaves for boot 

camp, Gibson draws on well-
worn war movie tropes, but even 
in doing so, cleverly subverts 
them. Vince Vaughn (“Wedding 
Crashers”) plays Doss’s drill 
sergeant, Howell. At first, he 
acts as is expected; he hates 
Doss, considers him a coward 
and makes life hell for him as a 
result. There’s nothing here that 
hasn’t been done in just about 
every war movie ever made. It’s as 
their relationship progresses that 
Howell becomes a more complex 
character, 
and 
his 
actions 

become less straightforwardly 
antagonistic and more believably 
human.

Then comes the war. There’s 

no mincing words here: these 
scenes are brutal, as brutal as war 
movies have ever been. Instead 
of, 
say, 
Spielberg’s 
approach 

to “Saving Private Ryan,” in 
which he followed Tom Hanks’s 
Captain Miller for most of the 
Omaha Beach scene, Gibson 
frequently switches the point of 
view between the characters of 
the supporting cast, leading to 
a feeling of disorientation and 
chaos that is likely similar to 
what soldiers at Okinawa felt. 
The enemy Japanese soldiers 
are rarely seen, and the soldiers, 
along with the audience, feel 
completely blind.

Still, what is most surprising 

about “Hacksaw Ridge” is the 
deft way Gibson deals with the 
complexities of war. America is, 
of course, in the right here, but 
it is clear that not every decision 
an American soldier makes is 
the right one. Doss’s convictions 
are never called into question, 
but neither does Gibson dismiss 
those who disagreed with him 
completely out of hand. It shows 
remarkable maturity from a 
director 
who 
has 
obviously 

had issues dealing with those 
different from him in the past.

“Hacksaw 
Ridge” 
is 
a 

remarkable war film. Its cast 
is nearly perfect, and both 
Garfield and Weaving may garner 
awards consideration as the 
year continues. The characters 
are complex and, likable or not, 
achingly human, and its war 
scenes are both devastating and 
awe-inspiringly crafted. With his 
first film in ten years, Mel Gibson 
has crafted a testament to true 
bravery, exhibited in both those 
who choose to fight and those 
who don’t.

ROSENSTOCK

I was irrevocably taken with 

Avril Lavigne’s “Sk8er Boi” when 
I heard it for the first time in 2nd 
grade. My best friend Sophie and 
I had started to move out of our 
respective “girly-girl” phases and 
into “tomboys,” stars in our eyes 
at the possibility of shedding our 
tutus for skateboards and baggy 
jeans. If our childhood were a 
Disney Channel show, you would 
have seen us sharing a split frame, 
cross-legged on our respective 
beds, each with a red Discman in 
hand and the lyric booklets at easy 
reach where we would memorize 
and analyze them like holy texts.

We marveled at Avril’s attitude, 

how she’d put her feet up on the 
table when she did interviews and 
swear and shop in the boy’s section 
for her clothes. We giggled at 
Avril’s lesser known song “Naked” 
and shamefully memorized all the 
words to “Nobody’s Fool,” where 
she raps. Although we were still in 
a phase where we refused to admit 
that we found boys anything less 
than revolting, I know that we both 
applied Avril’s angsty heartbreak 
lyrics to our first crushes.

Aside from being incredibly 

catchy and often easy for my 
almost tone deaf voice to sing along 
to, I isolated lyrics from Avril’s 
lyrics that sounded like they just 
“got” me. Exhibit A: on “In my 
World” she sings “I never spend 
less than an hour / watching my 
hair in the shower / it always takes 
five hours to make it straight” (I 
have and have always had a frizzy 
and unruly mane of hair). On 
“Nobody’s Fool,” “I’m not the milk 

and cheerios in your spoon” (hey, 
I’ve eaten those!).

The 
heart-wrenching 
stuff, 

although it hadn’t materialized 
practically in my life, was still 
down there somewhere I think. 
Avril gave big f-yous to guys who 
treated her like crap and sang 
about feeling out of place. I loved 
to rock out to hits “Complicated” 
and “My Happy Ending” although 
my deep love for Avril’s work was 
mildly pretentious. Sophie and I 
claimed a fierce loyalty beyond 
the hits — we held fast to the deep 
cuts.

Here, I want to thank my mom 

for being a cool mom. Not the 
“Mean Girls” type of cool mom; 
she was not about underage 
drinking or letting us call her 
Michele. She’s a cool mom because 
she let me skip school 12 years ago 
to see Avril perform live. It was 
November 1st and she wrote me a 
note excusing me from that day of 
fourth grade. I sat with my mother 
somewhere in the nosebleed seats 
of the FleetCenter and wore an 
overpriced Avril Lavigne shirt 
that fit me like a dress.

I felt the stadium vibrate 

beneath me and it was so loud 
that my mom gave me earplugs. I 
remember clutching her arm, with 
some certain level of fanaticism, 
saying “I can’t believe it’s really 
her.” I kept my eyes forward, 
and my mouth moving quietly to 
the lyrics, not wanting to miss a 
moment of sharing that celebrity 
space.

In “Happy Ending,” Avril sings, 

“All the things you hide from 
me / all the shit that they do.” I 
anticipated this line painfully 
and when it came I blushed at the 
thought of listening to the same 

song I’d listened to hundreds of 
times on my own with my mom by 
my side. Although I worshipped 
at the feet of a punk princess, I 
was a rigid rule-follower and as 
much as I wanted to get loud and 
provocative, I was anxious at my 
mother knowing I even existed in 
the same world as the word “shit.” 
As I said, my mom is cool mom, 
so of course she did not comment 
about the lyric and later noted 
that Avril had a beautiful voice 
and sounded a little like Sinead 
O’Connor (I did not know who 
Sinead O’Connor was).

That night, I fell asleep in a 

dreamy haze and returned home 
where I continued my religious 
listening for maybe a year or so. 
That said, Avril as we knew her 
was changing — she was adding 
pink to her hair and getting 
married and straying from the 
moody and darkly stubborn tones 
to catchier radio pop-punk that 
Sophie and I refused to listen to.

We chose to hold on to the Avril 

I saw live in 2004, the one we saw 
as our rebellious older sister who 
inspired us to buy skateboards we 
would barely learn how to ride. 
We’ve changed our red Discmans 
for Spotify premium. My spot in 
Avril’s stadium is now in a small 
venue somewhere filled with 
PBR and manbuns. That said, the 
magic is still in there somewhere 
in the form of pop-punk and room 
shaking as it did when I saw Avril 
live for the first time 12 years ago.

We’re 21 now, and if you need 

us, we’ll be in the corner defending 
the merits of Under my Skin 
and Let Go, lyrics committed to 
memory and a lifelong promise to 
never end up like that sad ballet 
girl in Sk8er Boi.

The tales are now famous, 

those of the physical, bloody, 
all-out basketball game that 
DJ Durkin and Jim Harbaugh 
once played at Stanford when 
Harbaugh was the head coach 
and Durkin the defensive 
ends 
coach. 
The 
game 

started spontaneously out of 
an informal meeting at the 
team’s facility.

Each man shoved the other, 

and both had too much pride 
to call fouls. They played to 
seven, as the countless stories 
have recounted. The game took 
more than an hour, the two 
coaches brawling with each 
other for every point, neither 
willing to surrender an inch.

The 
intensity 
and 

competitiveness they showed 
on that basketball court has 
led them up the ranks of their 
profession, Harbaugh to the 
helm of the No. 3 Michigan 
football team and Durkin to 
his first head coaching job at 
Maryland at age 38. They have 
spent time together since then, 
and each spoke highly of the 
other in the week leading up 
to their first matchup against 
each other.

Around 
2:50 
Saturday 

afternoon, 
Durkin 
— 

Harbaugh’s 
defensive 

coordinator in 2015 — stood at 
the 25-yard line at Michigan 
Stadium and snuck a peek at 
his former boss’ team on the 
other side of the field. Moments 
later, 
the 
two 
exchanged 

what appeared to be a cordial 
greeting.

But soon thereafter, they 

were back on that same Palo 
Alto basketball court. This 
time, Harbaugh’s team was 
simply better and left no doubt 
about it. Michigan demolished 

Durkin’s Terrapins, 59-3.

“We knew he was going to 

have those boys fired up and 
coming ready to play, so we’re 
going to approach it like any 
other game, but we’re going 
to play with a chip on our 
shoulder for sure, because we 
know what type of mentality 
Coach Durkin brings,” said 
senior running back De’Veon 
Smith. “And we want to match 
it, and actually go forth and put 
’em down in the dirt, really.”

The Wolverines (6-0 Big 

Ten, 9-0 overall) never let 
up, dealing one of their most 
dominant beatings of the year 
in a season full of them. They 
gained 31 first downs and 
amassed 660 total yards, their 
most of 2016, even greater 
than in their 78-0 thrashing of 
Rutgers.

From the outset, Michigan 

gave Maryland (2-4 Big Ten, 
5-4 overall) no breaks. On the 
first play from scrimmage, 
Speight threw incomplete to 
fifth-year senior wide receiver 
Amara Darboh down the right 
sideline. Harbaugh erupted, 
wanting a pass interference 
call, and he broke out his 
“train” 
formation 
on 
the 

next play. The Wolverines 
converted their ensuing third 
down and did not face another 
until they led 21-0.

Harbaugh 
unleashed 

another new trick play on the 
next series, again utilizing 
do-it-all redshirt sophomore 
Jabrill 
Peppers. 
Redshirt 

sophomore 
quarterback 

Wilton Speight handed off to 
Peppers, who threw across 
the field back to Speight, who 
hit a wide-open Jehu Chesson 
downfield. Two plays later, the 
6-foot-6, 243-pound Speight 
— who had minus-49 rushing 
yards on the season entering 
Saturday — scampered 10 yards 

into the end zone untouched.

“It’s not a one-dimensional 

offense where we’re trying 
to let one person dominate 
the 
game, 
and 
everybody 

understands that, so nobody’s 
going to be complaining if balls 
don’t come their way, or if they 
don’t get opportunities,” said 
senior tight end Jake Butt. 
“Because right now, we’ve got 
a great thing going, and we’re 
winning games.”

Of Michigan’s nine wins 

on the season, six have been 
decided 
by 
halftime, 
and 

Saturday’s was no different. The 
Wolverines led 35-0 at the break, 
extending their advantage in 
first halves this season to a total 
of 264-38. As in many of those 
games, the offense faced almost 
no resistance.

“That’s the players — that’s 

the guys that are out there 
doing it, and it deserves 
recognition, deserves a pat 
on the back,” Harbaugh said. 
“They’re the ones that are 
doing it. That’s what I would 
say to the offense.”

Durkin’s 
team 
stayed 

competitive for most of the 
first quarter as Michigan’s 
defense showed some cracks, 
giving up its second-highest 
yardage total of the season at 
367 (Michigan State gained 
401 last week). The Terrapins 
managed to move the ball early 
with their 12th-ranked rushing 
attack, and their first two 
drives lasted a combined 9:02, 
attempting to keep Michigan’s 
offense off the field.

But Maryland could never 

do enough to keep the game 
close. On their second drive, 
the Terrapins rolled all the way 
to the 1-yard line before they 
moved backward three times 
and then clanked a 29-yard 
field goal off the right upright.

Ryan, Michigan await another anxious Monday

It’s a Wednesday, which means 

it’s a day, which means Greg Ryan 
is optimistic.

The Michigan women’s soccer 

coach always 
seems to be 
positive about 
his 
team, 

always seems 
to think its 
best days are 
still ahead. In 
a few hours, 
Ryan’s 
team 

will 
board 

a 
plane 
to 

Minneapolis 
for the Big Ten Tournament. The 
Wolverines will take on No. 1 seed 
Minnesota in the semifinals two 
days later, a game that very well 
could determine their NCAA 
Tournament fate.

Ryan, 
meanwhile, 
believes 

his team is safe either way. 
He remains hopeful, which is 
difficult, because this time of year 
brings back memories of days that 
were anything but that.

A 
year 
ago 
Wednesday, 

Michigan’s 2015 season ended in 
its locker room. The Wolverines 
lost to Penn State in the same 
round of the Big Ten Tournament, 
the semifinals. They thought 
they’d be playing again the next 
weekend. They weren’t.

Most teams’ seasons culminate 

on the field — they lose in a 
penalty shootout, or they give 
up a late goal, or they’re just 
outplayed. Instead, Michigan’s 
players last year came home from 
State College, gathered under the 
stands at U-M Soccer Stadium 
and found their name absent from 
the NCAA Tournament field for 
the second year in a row.

“We were just sick. I don’t 

think there’s a good explanation 
for it,” Ryan said. “There were 
teams that were mathematical 
points ahead of us by two that 
we had beaten twice, and they 
took them above us. There were 

teams behind us RPI-wise that 
they pushed in front of us because 
they had beaten us head to head. 
So from our perspective, we felt 
like we’ve been left out two years 
in a row.”

Ryan called those two days the 

two most disappointing moments 
he has had in nine years at the 
helm of Michigan’s program. 
And another tense day is coming 
around Monday, when the NCAA 
announces the field for this year’s 
tournament.

The Wolverines are on the 

bubble again — ranked No. 44 
in the Ratings Percentage Index 
— but given how their last two 
seasons have ended, you can 
understand why even Ryan is 
hesitant to be optimistic.

“To be honest,” he said, “I’m 

just sickened by what’s happened 
the last two years.”

Michigan wasn’t as close in 

2014 as last year, but still had 
a chance. Two years ago, the 
Wolverines entered the selection 
show ranked No. 53 in the RPI, 
which is typically not good enough 
to make the cut. They also had a 
mediocre strength of schedule 
and played in the country’s fifth-
best conference, and they were 
still rebuilding from graduation 
losses after making the Elite Eight 
the year before, the best season in 
program history.

Last 
year 
stung 
worse. 

Michigan appeared to be in 
good shape to make it back. The 
Wolverines emerged from the 

Big Ten Tournament ranked No. 
46 in the RPI. They outranked 
Washington, yet the Huskies 
made the tournament on the 
strength 
of 
a 
head-to-head 

win 
against 
Michigan. 
The 

Wolverines beat Northwestern in 
the Big Ten Tournament, yet the 
Wildcats made the tournament on 
the strength of their RPI, which 
was two spots higher.

Hence the feeling of sickness. 

Last year, Michigan expected 
to watch the show, see its name, 
celebrate and then go practice 
in preparation for an NCAA 
Tournament game. Instead came 
that feeling of emptiness that 
plagues any team in any sport that 
watches the show and doesn’t see 
its name.

“It was pretty tough, mostly 

because I just felt bad for the 
seniors, and I felt like we let the 
seniors down after they gave 
so much to this program,” said 
senior defender Madisson Lewis. 
“It was just really disappointing 
because we felt like we did 
enough, but now we know that we 
can’t ever think that we’ve done 
enough — we just have to keep 
winning. That’s the only thing 
that we can do.”

A few hours after she said that, 

the Wolverines left for Minnesota 
to try to keep their season alive. 
The Big Ten semifinal counted as 
one game, the same as the other 18 
Michigan played this season. But 
Ryan’s team was not under any 
illusions — he has been around 

long enough to know that these 
ones are more meaningful.

“They just are,” he said. “… 

People that tell you, ‘Aw, it’s just 
any other game,’ they’re just 
trying to make everybody calm. 
It’s not any other game.”

Friday, they gave up a goal in the 

eighth minute and couldn’t sneak 
an equalizer past the Golden 
Gophers’ lights-out defense. It 
has surely been an anxious couple 
of days, and it will be an anxious 
next few hours until the NCAA 
announces the bracket, team by 
team, Monday at 4:30 p.m.

But Ryan can still rely on his 

optimism — he has his team’s 
credentials 
readily 
available. 

Last year, their best win was 
against No. 44 Northwestern. 
The Wolverines have played nine 
games against top-50 opponents 
and beaten three top-25 teams, 
including No. 5 Notre Dame, 2-0, 
back in August.

So 
even 
after 
Michigan’s 

elimination loss on Friday, Ryan 
stayed positive: “Honestly, I think 
they’re gonna call our name. I 
think they’re gonna put Michigan 
in the NCAA Tournament. I don’t 
think it’s questionable. I think it’s 
100 percent that we’ll be in, but 
based on the last two years, I do 
have some concerns.”

The Wolverines could have 

made it much easier on themselves 
by eking out a couple of wins 
this weekend and stealing the 
automatic bid. Now, they’ll just 
have to wait through a tenuous 
time. They know they have reason 
to believe this year, and they know 
they can compete if they see their 
name announced Monday. But the 
wounds from past heartbreak are 
still fresh.

“I would say,” Ryan started, 

pausing. “What can I say? There’s 
a lot of determination in this 
team to get back into the NCAA 
Tournament. … We’ve got a lot to 
prove.”

The Michigan women’s soccer team will have another day of waiting to hear whether its name is announced in the NCAA Tournament field on Monday.

Michigan falls to No. 1 Maryland 
in Big Ten tournament shootout

It was déjà vu for anyone 

who follows the Michigan men’s 
soccer team. The Wolverines 
played No. 1 Maryland for the 
second time in one week and took 
the game to a second overtime 
once again, but they couldn’t 
change the result this time 
around. For the second straight 
week, Michigan fell, 3-2, and this 
time, the loss ended its season.

The golden goal went to the 

Terrapins. Maryland midfielder 
George Campbell shielded senior 
defender Lars Eckenrode from 
the ball and managed to rattle off 
a shot to the lower-right corner. 
He beat the Wolverines’ backup 
goalkeeper — redshirt junior 
Braden Horton who replaced 
injured starter Evan Louro — and 
maintained Maryland’s unbeaten 
record. 

The Wolverines opened their 

Big Ten Tournament run on 
Saturday afternoon in College 
Park against Rutgers. Goals from 
sophomore 
forward 
Francis 

Atuahene 
and 
sophomore 

midfielder Ivo Cerda propelled 
Michigan passed the Scarlet 
Knights, to win 2-1.

It was a quick turnaround 

for the Wolverines, who had to 
play the Terrapins on Sunday 
evening. They opened the game 
with a lot of energy, but they 
were constantly trying to fight 
their way back after trailing for 
most of the game.

Michigan 
senior 
defender 

Andre Morris was the first to 
score in the 30th minute, though 
not for his own team. Maryland 
crossed it to the near post, and 
Morris attempted to clear it wide, 
but it grazed the top of his laces 
and found its way to the back of 
the net for an own goal.

It just took two minutes 

for the Wolverines to find an 
answer. Eckenrode headed a 
ball to the top of the box to the 
feet of senior midfielder Tyler 
Anderson, who buried it into the 
back of the net for the first goal 
of his career.

Only a minute later, the 

Terrapins were ahead again. 
After a slow clearance attempt 
from 
sophomore 
defender 

Marcello 
Borges, 
Maryland 

connected passes in the box and 
forward DJ Reeves slipped it past 
Michigan’s goalkeeper, putting 
them up, 2-1.

It was clear from a halftime 

interview that Maryland coach 
Sasho Cirovski was not pleased 
with 
his 
team’s 
first-half 

performance, and his team came 
out firing in the second half. 
The Wolverine defense could 
barely catch a breath due to the 
near-constant pressure from the 
Terrapins. It seemed that any 
time they got near the goal they 
were a threat, but they struggled 
to finish their chances.

Michigan had one shot on 

goal in the second half, and it 
found the back of the net. Senior 
defender Rylee Woods crossed 
it from the left to Atuahene who 
easily headed it home, equalizing 
the score.

The Wolverines managed to 

force the game into overtime. The 
last five minutes of regulation 

found the two posts to be the 
best defender on Michigan’s side, 
stopping three goals.

The constant pressure on 

Louro proved to be too much, 
as he exited the game with an 
injury before the start of the 
first overtime period. Horton 
had only played in one game this 
season, and he entered the most 
important game for Michigan 
this season at the most important 
time.

Unfortunately 
for 
the 

Wolverines, he wasn’t able to 
keep their season alive.

Michigan’s 
final 
game 

symbolizes its disappointing 
season. The team almost pulled 
it off, but just couldn’t finish 
the job.

“They were very resilient, 

much like they have been all 
season,” said Michigan coach 
Chaka Daley. “The soccer gods 
went against us a little bit. 
Certainly in those moments I 
don’t think we deserved to have 
that done to us. I don’t think we 
deserved some of the unfortunate 
things this year, but that’s soccer 
sometimes.”

out of the net and disgustedly 
punted it to midfield. The redshirt 
sophomore goalkeeper’s response 
to Minnesota’s game-winning goal 
was a summary of the Michigan 
women’s soccer team’s frustration 
the entire match.

The fourth-seeded Wolverines 

(6-3-2 Big Ten, 10-5-4 overall) 
were outplayed by the top-
seeded Golden Gophers (7-1-3, 
15-3-3), losing 1-0 in the Big Ten 
Tournament semifinals Friday in 
St. Paul, Minn.

Forward 
Julianna 
Gernes 

scored the lone goal for Minnesota, 
as she buried an attempt into a 
wide-open net off a rebound from 
midfielder Josee Stiever’s shot that 
drew post in the seventh minute. 
Gernes was the beneficiary of a 
Golden Gopher attack that rarely 
gave the Wolverine defense a rest 
in the first half. It was a Michigan 
turnover just outside the box that 
lead to the 3-on-2 scoring-chance 
for Minnesota.

“We gave away a silly goal 

— it was just so horrific,” said 
Michigan coach Greg Ryan. “You 
can’t give up those kinds of goals. 
Those are layups. We talked about 
not beating ourselves before the 

match, but we beat ourselves on 
that play.”

As 
the 
Wolverines 
found 

themselves with just 45 minutes 
to equalize, Ryan attempted to 
orchestrate a more offensively 
threatening 
formation 
by 

positioning his players higher 
up on the field. That desperation 
also contributed to a more 
physical style of play — Michigan 
committed seven fouls in the 
final frame.

But the formation and tenacity 

proved futile on the scoresheet, 
as the Wolverines were able to 
muster just two shots on net in 
the second half, leading to Gopher 
goalkeeper Sarah Hobbs’ 10th 
clean slate of the season.

“At 
the 
end 
of 
the 
day, 

(Minnesota) got a couple good 
looks on goal, and we didn’t get 
any — that was the difference,” 
Ryan said.

Michigan’s 
best 
scoring 

opportunity came during the 
game’s first minute, when junior 
Ani Sarkisian cut quickly upfield 
and blasted a shot off a Minnesota 
defender and out of bounds, 
resulting in a Wolverine corner. 
But the nerves of the heavyweight 
Minnesota club settled following 
Michigan’s initial rush — the 
Golden Gophers’ aggressive play 
led to their possession and shot 

domination in the opening frame.

With the loss, the Wolverines 

will have their NCAA Tournament 
fate determined by the selection 
committee 
for 
the 
third 

consecutive year, as Michigan 
hopes to hear its name called for 
an at-large selection on Monday. 
But after two consecutive years 
without 
a 
postseason 
berth 

despite respectable seasons, Ryan 
doesn’t have much confidence 
in 
the 
selection 
committee’s 

inclination to give the Wolverines 
their fourth appearance under the 
current head man.

“Based upon what the NCAA 

has done the last two years, I have 
no evidence to support that (we’re 
going to be selected),” Ryan said. 
“We’ve got three wins against the 
top 25 and a tie against Minnesota 
— we’ve never had a better resume 
to get in. I don’t have a lot of 
confidence in the committee to 
figure this out.”

Though 
the 
fate 
of 
the 

Wolverines’ 
season 
is 
still 

in 
question, 
Michigan 
plans 

on practicing Monday as if it 
indeed has a place in the NCAA 
tournament. If Ryan’s team gets 
selected and breaks its two-
year postseason drought, maybe 
practice will consist of Jackson 
launching a punt in triumphant 
joy rather than frustration.

Michigan opens with exhibition win

Though the Michigan men’s 

basketball 
team 
absorbed 
a 

couple of significant losses to its 
NCAA Tournament squad from 
last year, the starting lineup was 
supposed 
to be the 
area 
that 

provided 
this year’s team a sense of 
stability.

But when the Wolverines 

stormed out of the tunnel under 
the veil of darkness at Crisler 
Center on Friday night, two 
familiar faces were missing from 
the public-address announcer’s 
introductions: 
junior 
guard 

Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-

Rahkman and senior forward 
Mark Donnal.

A late scratch due to an ankle 

injury 
suffered 
in 
practice 

Thursday, Abdur-Rahkman sat 
out of Friday’s season-opening 
exhibition 
game 
against 

Armstrong State. But Michigan 
found a capable replacement 
for the night, as senior forward 
Sean Lonergan jumped at the 
opportunity, providing an early 
spark for the Wolverines.

Donnal, on the other hand, 

has been locked with sophomore 
forward Moritz Wagner in a 
highly competitive battle for the 
‘5’ spot in the lineup, and after a 
strong summer of improvement, 
Wagner earned the starting nod.

In 
a 
matchup 
against 
a 

Division II opponent, Michigan 
wasn’t challenged, so those two 
differences might not have been 
influential. But the impact made 
by Wagner and Lonergan in 
the Wolverines’ 77-49 victory 
over 
the 
Pirates 
warrants 

considerable attention.

While some might have been 

surprised to hear his name 
called, Lonergan wasted no time 
quieting the murmurs. With 
an assist and a block in his first 
minute as a starter and pair of 
driving layups soon thereafter, 

he helped propel Michigan to a 
12-4 lead just five minutes into 
the game.

“Sean knows every position 

out there, and we didn’t feel 
we were in a point where 
we wanted to trade people 
around,” said Michigan coach 
John Beilein. “... Sean sees the 
game pretty well and got us off 
to a really good start.”

Reaping the benefits of his 

new role, Wagner packed most 
of the punch for the Wolverines 
against the Pirates. Tallying 15 
points on 7-for-9 shooting in 
25 minutes, he showed off the 
growth of his game since the end 
of last season.

“I mean, you see the way he 

runs the floor, and you saw his 
skill level a couple of times, too, 
so that’s big — his development 
is huge,” Beilein said. “He’s 
going to have to get out there, 
like you said, and his defense 
is much better and he stayed 
out of foul trouble. He really 
understands that.”

For 
much 
of 
the 
game, 

Michigan had its way with 
Armstrong State, but the nearly 
30-point blowout wasn’t always 
safely in the Wolverines’ grasp. 
For the opening five minutes 
of the second half, Armstrong 
State gave Michigan a run for 
its money, going on a 13-4 tear 
to shrink the lead to 11. Unhappy 
with the sloppy 
play of his team, 
which 
had 

succumbed 
to 

a string of bad 
turnovers 
and 

unforced errors, 
Beilein 
called 

a 
timeout 
to 

set the players 
straight.

“I 
hate 

turnovers, 
you 

know, they just lose you games,” 
Beilein said. “I think we had 
two missed dunks, and we had a 
couple of lob opportunities that 
just were lazy passes — they’re 
just bad turnovers.

“A missed dunk is a lob 

turnover, so we always say, ‘I 
want you to dunk like crazy, 
whenever you want to, just make 
sure it goes through the basket.’… 

Highlights 
are 
highlights 

because 
they 

rarely 
happen. 

You can’t try to 
make every play 
a highlight play.”

Instead 
of 

brushing 
aside 

nonchalant 
play as part of 
shaking off the 
rust, Beilein took 

the opportunity to teach his 
team a lesson. The Wolverines 
responded 
immediately, 

erupting with an outburst of 15 
straight points to stretch the 
lead back to 22 and holding the 

Pirates scoreless for over seven 
minutes to end any real threat.

While it may not have been 

the most convincing of victories 
or the most important of games, 
Michigan walked away with 
enough promising performances 
across 
the 
board 
to 
feel 

optimistic about the season.

“There’s so many things that 

you can grow from when you 
have opportunities to just go 
play against somebody else. I 
find it very helpful,” Beilein 
said. “And probably the most 
beneficial 
time 
you’ll 
have 

during your early season will 
be the cut of the film after the 
first exhibition game, if you’re 
playing a game with some good 
quickness and you’re playing a 
game that merits the watching 
of the film, and I think that 
(game) does.”

ICE HOCKEY
‘M’ beats Arizona State

After struggling in many 

facets of the game last weekend, 
the 
Michigan 
hockey 
team 

corrected 
many 
of 
those 

mistakes 
on 
Friday, 
beating 
Arizona 

State, 4-1.

Much of the focus this season 

has been on the goaltending 
situations for the Wolverines, 
and against the Sun Devils, the 
Wolverines decided to go back 
to senior Zach Nagelvoort in net. 
Nagelvoort hadn’t started since 
the first game of the season for 
Michigan, but he stood strong 
in net, accruing 31 saves.

After 
his 
performance 

on Friday, there still isn’t a 
clear-cut starter for the rest 
of the season — freshmen 
Jack LaFontaine and Hayden 
Lavigne have shared the bulk 
of the action so far. But as far 
as teammates are concerned, 
all of them have the rest of the 
Wolverines’ full support.

“I think we have all of the 

confidence in the world in all of 
them,” said senior defenseman 
Nolan 
De 
Jong. 
“They’re 

competing their asses off, and 
they’re getting the chance to 
play. Today (Nagelvoort) showed 
that he was prepared and ready 
to go. So we’ll see what happens 
next week and what the coaches 
do with the starting goalie, but 
he’s a guy that we all trust back 
there to do well.”

For his own part, De Jong 

joined the offensive output for 
Michigan. The senior notched the 
first goal in his four years with 
the Wolverines, and while it isn’t 
necessarily his role to be a scorer, 
De Jong was certainly relieved to 
get the monkey off his back.

“It’s been a long time since 

I scored a goal in a meaningful 
game,” De Jong said. “So it feels 
good, but it’s nice to be able to 
contribute again offensively, and 

finally get back in the win column.”

And while De Jong’s goal 

began the scoring for Michigan, 
its other goals came from the 
most watched group on the 
team: the freshmen.

Forward 
Will 
Lockwood 

scored 
two 
goals, 
one 

shorthanded, 
while 
fellow 

forward 
Adam 
Winborg 

contributed with a goal of his 
own. Winborg’s was his second 
of the year in as many games.

And 
though 
the 
offense 

was finally impressive for the 
Wolverines, arguably the team’s 
most impressive unit of the night 
was its penalty kill. Michigan 
was called for seven penalties 
in the game, but its penalty kill 
stood tall. The unit didn’t allow 
any goals all night, keeping 
Arizona State off the scoreboard 
throughout the night.

“It’s just part of the game, 

and those are the minutes that I 
like to play,” De Jong said. “Any 
way that I can help the team, 
or the guys that kill penalties 
can help the team, we’re more 
than willing to put our bodies 
on the line. We had some big 
blocks from guys like (freshman 
forward) 
Steven 
Merl, 
and 

(freshman defenseman) Luke 
Martin was really good on the 
penalty kill. So I think we know 
what we have to do.”

The Wolverines will now face 

potentially the best team on 
their schedule, when they face 
No. 4 Boston University next 
weekend at Yost Ice Arena. And 
even with the win against the 
Sun Devils, Michigan knows it 
still needs to improve to pull out 
an upset.

“It’s going to come back to 

defense and goaltending,” De 
Jong said. “I think we gave up too 
many odd-man rushes where we 
didn’t get a bounce and gave up 
2-on-0 and a few 2-on-1s where 
they could have capitalized. And 
we can’t afford to give up those 
opportunities to Boston.

“But we’re going to continue to 

improve and be ready for Boston.”

MEN’S BASKETBALL
‘M’ legend Cazzie Russell 
visits ‘the house he built’

With the band playing “The 

Victors” behind him and the 
cheer and dance teams running 
across the court to get in place for 
the Michigan men’s basketball 
team’s pregame introductions, 
Cazzie Russell walked out on to 
the court behind the Armstrong 
State players.

For the first time in his life, 

Russell was on the opposing side 
at a Michigan basketball game. 
It was an unfamiliar position 
for the Pirate associate head 
coach to be in during Michigan’s 
77-49 exhibition win over their 
Division II foe.

This was a man whose jersey 

is retired in the Crisler Center’s 
rafters, a man who is No. 5 on 
Michigan’s 
all-time 
scoring 

list, and most importantly the 
namesake in the title, “The 
House that Cazzie Built,” a 
moniker for the Wolverines’ 
current home.

But 
being 
on 
Michigan’s 

opposing bench wasn’t the only 
unfamiliar position Russell was 
in — the whole experience itself 
was unfamiliar, a peculiar place 
for one of the most-acclaimed 
Wolverines to be in.

“I didn’t know what to 

say,” Russell said. “This is 
uncharted waters.”

Standing 
at 
midcourt 

was the man that made the 
construction of the Crisler 
Center possible, and it was 
completely new territory.

***

Russell played at Michigan 

until 1966, one year before the 
Crisler Center was built. He 
plied his talent in the Yost Field 
House, which is now Yost Ice 
Arena.

But 
Russell, 
of 
all 
the 

Michigan 
legends, 
had 
the 

biggest 
influence 
in 
the 

construction of the Crisler 
Center. And he almost didn’t 
come to Ann Arbor in the first 
place. 

When Russell was picking 

colleges, it came down to three 
schools: UCLA, Cincinnati and 
Michigan.

“Oscar Robertson comes to 

my high school and says, ‘Well 
you got to go Cincinnati,’ so I 
go up and take a visit, and then 
I visited John 
Wooden 
and 

UCLA,” Russell 
said. “Now, I had 
to narrow down 
my chances, and 
I’m 
wondering 

why 
I 
hadn’t 

heard anything 
from Michigan?

“So I prayed 

about it, and the 
Lord said to call 
Michigan.”

That call was just what 

Russell needed, and it turned 
out that Michigan had thought 
Russell 
lost 
interest. 
After 

the 
two 
sides 
reconciled, 

the Wolverines told him to 
come visit Ann Arbor. After a 
long visit and talk with then-
Michigan coach Dave Strack, 
the rest was history.

Russell led the Wolverines 

to three-straight Big Ten titles, 
along with three straight NCAA 
Tournament 
berths, 
placing 

third in 1963. Russell also 
garnered Player of the Year 
honors in 1966, which propelled 
him into the NBA Draft, where 
he was selected No. 1 overall by 
the New York Knicks.

***

The impact Russell has had 

is evident to most Michigan 
fans. But for Russell’s players 
at Armstrong State, visiting the 
arena where their coach’s jersey 
is retired contextualized just 
how great of player Russell was. 
It gave the Pirate associate head 
coach some validation.

“Kids 
hear 
about 
you,” 

Russell said. “It’s been 54 years 
since I came to Michigan, and 
they hear about you, and that 
holds them. Now you got to give 
them something that makes 
them know that you know what 

the hell you’re 
talking about.

“For them to 

see where it all 
started for me is 
a great feeling.”

Inside 
“The 

House 
That 

Cazzie 
Russell 

Built” on Friday 
night, 
Russell 

was given the 
floor before the 

game to say a few words to the 
Crisler crowd.

Russell used the time to ask 

the fans permission to let him be 
on the opposing sideline.

“When I left, I told myself 

I would never play or coach 
against 
Michigan,” 
Russell 

said. “Tonight, just give me this 
one game.”

And while Russell’s one game 

ended with 28-point loss to the 
home team, Russell was just 
happy to be back.

“To be blessed to come here 

and play in 1962, and to be alive 
to come back here in 2016 to see 
that transformation,” Russell 
said, “all I can do is thank God 
for this gift.”

Wolverines pick up two wins

Walking onto the court with 

a rose in one hand and the other 
hand in the arms of their parents, 
the Michigan volleyball team 
stood huddled on the court with 
a game plan and an urgent sense 
to win.

The 17th-ranked Wolverines 

came out strong this weekend 
with back-to-back wins against 
Illinois and Northwestern. This 
followed Michigan’s first two-
game losing streak this season 
the previous weekend to Purdue 
and Indiana.

Saturday at Cliff Keen Arena, 

the Wolverines witnessed their 
fifth straight sold-out crowd. 
Riding 
momentum 
from 
its 

3-1 win over Illinois Friday 
night, 
Michigan 
took 
down 

Northwestern 
in 
four 
sets, 

dropping only the second.

“Coming off of a win is 

especially 
motivating,” 
said 

senior middle blocker Abby Cole.

The game ended with three 

Michigan players earning double-
digit numbers in kills: Cole, junior 
middle blocker Claire Kieffer-
Wright and Carly Skjodt. Skjodt 
earned her fifth kill-dig double-
double this season.

Welsh started the first set with 

an assist to Kieffer-Wright for 
the first kill of the game. Kieffer-
Wright, finishing with 13 kills, 
led both teams in the first set 
with five kills over 10 attempts. 
With the match remaining close, 
Michigan finally sparked a three-
point run to establish a solid lead. 
Northwestern called for a timeout 
to attempt to turn the momentum. 
Kieffer-Wright helped close out 
the first set with two kills and a 
block during a 6-1 Michigan run 
that ended the set, 25-17.

Serving was a strength for the 

Wolverines in the match versus 
Illinois, where they tallied 11 
service aces, including the game-
winner. However, in the second 
set, Michigan’s service became a 
liability. The problem wasn’t about 
errors, it was just soft serving, 
which 
led 
to 
Northwestern 

dominating the set.

“I thought we just served 

too easy,” said Michigan coach 

Mark Rosen. “I thought in the 
second set, we were just putting 
it into play and we were making 
a team look good because they 
were able to control the ball 
well. Service is first contact. 
Pass is first contact. You want to 
win the first-contact battle.”

Northwestern 
started 
out 

aggressive, going on a 9-4 run 
to start the set. The easy serves 
allowed the Wildcats cleaner 
receptions, outscoring Michigan 
in digs, 17-10, in the second set. 
Northwestern, with a prior lead, 
went on a five-point run and took 
the set 25-17.

The third set proved to be a 

challenge for both teams. With 
six lead changes and seven ties 
before either team reached 10 
points, Michigan went on a 7-1 
run after a substitution to bring 
junior opposite hitter Katherine 
Mahlke into the game.

“It really just depends on the 

opponent, and so I thought in that 
situation, (Mahlke) came in and 
made a great impact,” Rosen said. 
“She came out because we were 

looking for a different matchup, 
and it was mainly about blocking.”

The 
Wolverines 
won 
the 

third set largely because of their 
blocking. They gained six block 
assists in the set, and seven 
players totaled 16 over the course 
of four sets.

A series of attack errors by 

Wildcat opposite hitter Symone 
Abbott allowed Michigan to 
quash any attempt to shift the 
momentum, as the Wolverines’ 
Kieffer-Wright 
and 
redshirt 

freshman middle blocker Cori 
Crocker helped lock down the 
third set with blocks and kills.

In 
the 
fourth 
set, 
again, 

Michigan 
and 
Northwestern 

battled for the lead early — but the 
Wolverines clinched the set, 25-17.

Michigan made up for its 

serving problems early in the 
game by serving an ace for the 
win. Welsh placed the ball to the 
left, bouncing off an unprepared 
hitter as the ball spiraled out 
of bounds, over the heads of 
pursuing players to put on the 
finishing touches.

The news only worsened for 

Maryland in the second quarter, 
when Hills went down on the first 
play and did not return. Caleb 
Rowe replaced him under center, 
and whatever momentum the 
Terrapins had disappeared.

Most of the second half was 

merely a formality. The stands 
cleared out, and the clock ran 
quickly. Early in the fourth 
quarter, Rowe moved Maryland 
into Michigan territory with a 
39-yard pass. Moments later, the 
Terrapins managed their only 
points on a 37-yard field goal.

When it went through the 

uprights, 
the 
fans 
remaining 

at 
Michigan 
Stadium 
let 

out a smattering of boos in 
disappointment. 
They, 
like 

Harbaugh and Durkin on Saturday 
and like the two coaches on the 
famed basketball court years ago, 
were unhappy to yield anything.

Speight puts on a show in Wolverines’ rout

Wilton Speight didn’t know 

his coach would casually toss 
his name into Heisman Trophy 
discussion 
Saturday 
night. 

It wasn’t long ago that Jim 
Harbaugh wouldn’t even publicly 
declare Speight the starter.

But after Speight completed 

19 of 24 passes for 362 yards 
and two touchdowns in No. 3 
Michigan’s 59-3 dismantling of 
Maryland, Harbaugh wasn’t shy 
about touting a second player’s 
campaign for college football’s 
highest honor.

“The way he’s been playing 

all season,” Harbaugh said, “it’s 
time to throw his hat into the 
ring.”

Harbaugh went as far as to say 

Speight’s first half — in which he 

racked up 292 of those yards on 
13-of-16 passing — was the best 
half of football he’s ever seen 
from a Michigan quarterback.

Speight 
was, 
indeed, 

exceptional. He made few — 
if any — mistakes, he made a 
handful of spectacular plays, 
and he did so while pushing 
Michigan’s offense to a new level 
of effectiveness.

On the Wolverines’ second 

drive of the game, Speight 
handed off to Jabrill Peppers, 
who ran right, then threw back 
to Speight. Speight waited a 
moment with the ball, and even 
while a Maryland defender 
barreled toward him, he stood 
in and delivered a 40-yard strike 
to fifth-year senior receiver 
Jehu Chesson.

Speight’s presence was one 

of the themes of the game. He 

evaded tacklers, stepping slightly 
inside or outside to keep plays 
alive, and did so without being 
especially fast. With 42 seconds 
left in the half, Speight stepped 
ahead of what looked destined 
to be a sack, then reset and found 
Chesson all alone in the back of 
the end zone.

Michigan’s 
redshirt 

sophomore 
quarterback 
is 

frequently compared to Ben 
Roethlisberger of the NFL’s 
Pittsburgh 
Steelers, 
and 
on 

Saturday, he looked the part.

“I watch a lot of Big Ben film 

and I see how he anticipates 
it, which is to wiggle there, a 
wiggle here, then gets his eyes 
right back to downfield to fire a 
touchdown,” Speight said.

Asked why he was so effective 

at 
eluding 
tackles, 
Speight 

credited his ability to running a 

spread offense in high school. He 
had to scramble, and now, he’s 
seeing the benefits while playing 
in a pro-style offense.

At a self-declared 6-foot-6, 

245 lbs., Speight’s size plays a 
role in his elusiveness, too. (“I 
can’t imagine that’s that easy 
to bring down,” he said.) He 
has demonstrated an ability to 
shake off tacklers, and in some 
sense, he can empathize with 
those who are tasked with 
pressuring him.

But perhaps the most telling 

difference is Speight’s patience. 
Early in the season, he had a 
propensity to force throws when 
under duress. Often, they worked 
out anyway. Lately, though, he 
says he has felt a shift in the feel 
of the game.

“I feel like everything is 

slowing down,” Speight said. “I 

feel like I’m becoming a better 
leader throughout the game in 
the huddle, and stepping into 
situations that I need to and 
letting them ride out when I 
need to.”

That was evident on Saturday. 

Speight reset and refocused 
while under pressure, and rarely 
were any of his throws off target.

But even though he likely 

played the best game of his 
career, Speight wasn’t about to 
proclaim himself a Heisman 
contender like his coach did.
