New consortium to
oversee stem cell
research efforts
By STEPHANIE STEINBERG
Daily StaffReporter
Last year, a woman came to the
University Medical School look-
ing to donate her in vitro fertil-
ization embryos.
She had recently lost the abil-
ity to walk because of an inher-
ited spinal cord abnormality and
hoped the University's stem cell
discoveries could one day help
hen regain the use of her legs.
But that was before the pas-
sage of Proposal 2 in November.
And because of restrictions in the
state of Michigan, the researchers
were forced to turn her away.
Now they don't have to.
Alittlemore thanthree months
after the passage of Proposal 2,
University stem cell research-
ers say the formation of a new
research consortium paired with
a more research-friendly advo-
cate in the White House creates a
brightfuture forthe field in astate
that is far behind many others.
Before the proposal's passage,
Eva Feldman, director of both
the A. Alfred Taubman Medical
Research Institute and the Pro-
gram for Neurology Research &
Discovery, was forced to perform
her research in California - a

state with looserstem cell restric-
tions.
In California, Feldman has
been transplanting embryonic
stem cells into the spinal cords of
rats that carry the gene for Amyo-
trophic Lateral Sclerosis, or Lou
Gehrig's disease. The goal of here
research is to determine whether
stem cell transplantation can be
used as a potential therapy to
treat people with ALS.
Because her research uses
embryonic stem cells, her work
was illegal in Michigan before the
Nov. 4 election.
For the past couple months,
Feldman said she has been trans-
ferring equipment from her
laboratory in California to the
University of Michigan, and that
it's "really exciting for us that we
can now do what we want to do in
Michigan."
Stem cell researchers at the
University are in the process of
forming The Consortium for Stem
Cell Therapy, a facility that will
provide researchers the space to
derive new embryonic stem cell
lines.
Gary Smith, director of the
Reproductive Sciences Program,
and Sue O'Shea, director of the
Center for Human Embryonic
Stem Cell Research, will both
head the consortium when it offi-
cially opens in late spring.
O'Shea said one of the consor-
tium's goals is to create disease-

Innocence Clinic
bucks trend, takes on
non-DNA cases
By AMY MUNSLOW
DailyStaffReporter
One Sunday afternoon in down-
town Ecorse, Mich., a city just
outside of Detroit, DeShawn and
Marvin Reed shot Shannon Ghol-
ston through the back of Gholston's

gold Ford Contour, paralyzing him
from the neck down.
At least, that's what Gholston
testified in 2001.
And despite conflicting eyewit-
ness testimonies, a verified alibi
for the Reeds, no physical evidence
that tied the uncle and nephew or
their car to the scene, and reports
of an alternate suspect, a judge
sentenced the Reeds to 20 years
in prison for assault with intent to
commit murder.
But because of law students at

the University's Innocence Clinic,
which officially opened its doors
this winter semester, the Reeds
may now have a shot at reclaiming
their freedom.
The clinic, a seven-credit course
taught at the Law School, provides
upper-level law students with the
skills and resources to correct
lapses in the state legal system -
like the ones that occurred in the
Reeds' case.
Similar programs around the
state, including the Innocence

Project at the Thomas M. Cooley
Law School in Lansing, work to re-
examine cases with new evidence
that could prove the innocence of
convicted persons.
However, the majority of these
other clinics only work with cases
where new DNA evidence has come
to light. The Innocence Clinic is
among a handful of programs
across the country that focus on
cases involving non-DNA evidence.

Student Assembly in its upcoming election,
held its first mass meeting last night in the
Michigan Union.
Engineering Rep. Ambreen Sayed, who's

DailyNewsEditorandManagingEditor
Michigan freshman wide receiver Darryl
Stonum pled guilty to a charge of operating
a vehicle while visibly impaired yesterday in
Ann Arbor's 15th District Court, according
to court records.
Stonum was arrested on Sept. 28 at about
3:30 a.m., hours after Michigan's comeback
27-25 win over Wisconsin the previous after-

noon. State police pulled him over on State
Street near campus, The Ann Arbor News
reported. While passing through an inter-
section, his car was traveling at around 60
miles per hour and almost hit another vehi-
cle, according to the News report.
Police administered a preliminary breath
test at the scene, which found Stonumn's blood
alcohol content at .10, the News reported.
Stonum was 18 at the time, and under Michi-

IN THE SPIRIT OF MLK

Revenge on the Daily

In October 1979, in the
midst of his legendary career
as head coach of the Michi-
gan football team, Bo Schem-
bechler brought his game plan
for a strong defense off the
field and aimed it at a Michi-
gan Daily reporter.
Dan Perrin, a senior sports
editor covering football for
the Daily at the time, was pri-
vately interviewing Schem-
bechler when the legendary
coach became irate after being
asked about the team's short-
comings and shoved Perrin.
Perrin had asked Schem-
bechler how he planned to
address the team's weak kick-
ers, who had only miade one
out of 10 field goals attempted
that season.
"Would you emphasize
the kicking game more when
recruiting from now on, after

what's happened so far this
season?" Perrin asked, accord-
ing to a Michigan Daily article
at the time.
About to respond, Schem-
bechler became angry about
the question. Schembechler
proceeded to knock the micro-
phone Perrin was holding
from his hand, poke him in the
chest, then grab his throat and
push him backward.
"Don't try to make me look
bad, you understand, son, or
I'll throw you the hell out of
Michigan football," he said.
The incident took place at
Wdber's Inn on Jackson Road,
outside the press luncheon
room the site of weekly press
conferences with Schem-
bechler.
Despite being shaken, Per-
rin was not particularly upset
about the incident. Perrin

attributed Schembechler's out-
burst to the less-than-desired
kicking record at the time.
"I think Bo was just frus-
trated with his kicking game,
not necessarily angry with me
as an individual," Perrin told
the Daily at the time.
Schembechler also
appeared to have recovered
from the incident. When asked
by the Daily at the time about
his reason for shoving Perrin,
he laughed and said, "I don't
even remember; you know
these kids."
Though the 1979 football
season was not the Wolver-
ines' best, finishing the season
with an 8-4 record, Schem-
bechler solidified his reputa-
tion as an equally aggressive
opponent both on and off the
field.

uprising in Iraq conflict

funds goes online homeowners

Gov. Jennifer Granholm's
administration created a Web site
yesterday that broadly outlines
her priorities for spending Michi-
gan's share of the federal stimulus
money.
The site includes a 1,200-plus
page wish list of projects that edu-
cational institutions, local gov-
ernments and state agencies hope
might get a share of the federal
stimulus cash. But it doesn't give
specifics on how much money the
state will get or how it will be dis-
tributed.
None of the 16,000 submitted
project requests - worth about
$59 billion combined - have been
approved. The Granholm adminis-
tration warns on the Web page that
not all the projects will be funded
and that some wouldn't even be eli-
gible for funding.
Granholm, a Democrat, is
expected to discuss the federal
stimulus plan with local transpor-
tation officials at events in Lansing,
Detroit and Flint tomorrow and
in Grand Rapids and Kalamazoo
tomorrow.

A handful of Republican gover-

gling with record foreclosures and
soaring unemployment.
Though none has outright
rejected the money available for
education, health care and infra-
structure, the governors of Texas,
Mississippi, Louisiana, Alaska,
South Carolina and Idaho have all
questioned whether the $787 bil-
lion bill signed into law this week
will even help the economy.
"My concern is there's going to
be commitments attached to it that
are a mile long," said Texas Gov.
Rick Perry, who considered reject-
P ing some of the money but decided
Wednesday to accept it. "We need

And we need the freedom to say

WASHINGTON
Troops 'stalemated'
in Afghanistan,
commander says
The top U.S. commander in
Afghanistan offered a grim view
Wednesday of military efforts in
southern Afghanistan, warning
that 17,000 new troops will take
on emboldened Taliban insur-
gents who have "stalemated" U.S.
and allied forces.
Army Gen. David McKier-
nan also predicted that the bol-
stered numbers of U.S. soldiers in
Afghanistan - about 55,000 in all
- will remain near those levels for
up to five years.
Still, McKiernan said, that is
only about two-thirds of the num-
ber of troops he has requested to
secure the war-torn nation.
McKiernan told reporters at the
Pentagon on Wednesday that the
extra Army and Marine forces will
be in place by the summer, primed
for counterinsurgency operations
against the Taliban.

Lending plan aims
to prevent 9 million
homeowners from
being evicted
MESA, Ariz. (AP) - President
Barack Obama threw a $75 bil-
lion lifeline to millions of Ameri-
cans on the brink of foreclosure
yesterday, declaring an urgent
need for drastic action - not only
to save their homes but to keep
the housing crisis "from wreak-
ing even greater havoc" on the
broader national economy.
The lending plan, a full $25 bil-
lion bigger than the administra-
tion had been suggesting, aims
to prevent as many as 9 million
homeowners from being evicted
and to stabilize housing markets
that are at the center of the ever-
worsening U.S. recession.
Government support pledged
to mortgage giants Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac is being dou-
bled as well, to $400 billion, as
part of an effort to encourage
them to refinance loans that are
"under water" - those in which
homes' market values have sunk
below the amount the owners
still owe.
"All of us are paying a price for

this home mortgage crisis, and
all of us will pay an even steep-
er price if we allow this crisis
to continue to deepen," Obama
said.
The new president, focusing
closely on the economy, in his
first month in office, rolled out
the housing program one day
after he was in Denver to sign his
$787 billion emergency stimu-
lus plan to revive the rest of the
economy. And his administra-
tion is just now going over fresh
requests for multiple billions in
bailout cash from ailing auto-
makers.
Wall Street has shown little
confidence in the new steps,
declining sharply on Tuesday
before leveling off after Wednes-
day's announcement. The Dow
Jones industrials rose 3 points
for the day.
Success of the foreclosure res-
cue is far from certain.
The administration is loosen-
ing refinancing restrictions for
many borrowers and providing
incentives for lenders in hopes
that the two sides will work
together to modify loans. But no
one is required to participate.
The biggest players in the mort-
gage industry temporarily had
halted foreclosures in advance of
Obama's plan.

Regional resources
helped to finance
insurgency, Cole says
By ANNIE THOMAS
For the Daily
In a lecture yesterday, Juan Cole,
professor of Middle Eastern and
South Asian history at the Univer-
sity and an expert on the Middle
East, discussed howa band of mili-
tants in Iraqwere foiled many of the
plans the U.S. political and military
officials had for the country.
The event, sponsored by the Col-
lege of Literature, Science and the
Arts, introduced Cole as the Richard
P. Mitchell Collegiate Professor in
History, an honor acknowledgingthe
accomplishments of the most senior
faculty members at the University.
The lecture - entitled "Collec-
tive Action in American Iraq: Can
the People Thwart Empire?" -
detailed the Bush administration's
actions in Iraq and how its plans
and policies were thwarted by
groups of militants.
Cole said officials in the U.S. gov-
ernment didn't anticipate that their
goals would be challenged in Iraq.
"The Bush administration had
a set of goals in. Iraq which, they
didn't announce publicly...and they
gave interviews, and if you are
good at Lexus Nexus you can find
out what they thought they were
up to," he said. "And those goals
were undone by Iraqis of various
sorts, including slum doctors and
poor people and workers and union
members and so forth."
He went on to discuss the role
of Iraq's unique culture in the con-
flict. The country houses regional
resources which, when taken over
by militant groups, funded their
efforts. He cited hijacked petro-
leum and looted antiquities as the
main revenue sources.
"It was not well known by the
people who planned this occupation
but it has certain features, which
made it a poison pill and made it
particularly difficult to occupy,
dominate, exploit," Cole said.

Prof. Juan Cole discusses the situation in Iraq during a lecture yesterday

For automakers,
no easy solutions

Cole added that he thinks Presi-
dent Barack Obama doesn't have a
thorough knowledge of the details
that he outlined in his lecture, but
that he is well equipped to handle
the situation in Iraq.
"I don't think (Obama) probably
knows these details about Iraq but
I think he knows what colonialism
was and the damage that it did to
people's psyches," he said. "And so I
think his instincts on this are good."
Cole also said though the mili-
tary is somewhat divided on the
withdrawal, many military officials'
are looking for a way out.
"I do have some contacts in
Washington, my own feeling from
them, is the senior officers, they're
really sick and tired of Iraq and
they think it's breaking the army

and they want out," he said.
Ann Arbor resident Peter Ber-
tocci, who attended the lecture,
said he found it to be informative
and thought provoking.
"What he did was essentially
package everything in a way which
made it coherent and gave you
something to think about what
happened," he said.
Rackham Graduate School stu-
dent Andrea Wright, who is study-
ing anthropology and history, said
the lecture gave her the resources to
evaluate the U.S. presence in Iraq.
"I think it confirmed suspicions
and gave me information to be able
to critique and thinkaboutthe U.S's
role and think through its goals and
what ideological positions informed
those goals," she said.

GM, Chrysler say
they need billions
more to stay afloat
WASHINGTON (AP) - Gen-
eral Motors Corp. and Chrysler
LLC, two venerable titans of
American industry, will burn
through $17.4 billion in govern-
ment loans in three months and
want billions more to stay alive.
The ink is still drying on their
new requests for an additional
$21.6 billion, but for President
Barack Obama's month-old
administration, there are no easy
answers.
Give them more money? GM
and Chrysler could return seek-
ing more. Let them slip into
bankruptcy? Hundreds of thou-
sands of jobs could be lost. Try a
government-led bankruptcy? In
GM's case, that might cost up to
$100 billion.
"There can't be a bottom-

less pit to this. There aren't the
resources to deal with it," White
House press secretary Robert
Gibbs said Wednesday as the
government began reviewing the
automakers' plans.
"We have to get a sustained
path to that restructuring to
ensure that there isn't a constant
necessity for continued govern-
ment intervention and money
from the taxpayers," Gibbs said.
At stake is much more than
the future of the PT Cruiser or
the Saturn Vue. Jobs at assembly
plants, car dealers, parts suppli-
ers and the small businesses that
serve them could be at risk in a
fatigued economy in which near-
ly 12 million people are unem-
ployed, including about 600,000
who got pink slips last month.
"This is an entire way of life
here," said Republican Rep.
Thaddeus McCotter who repre-
sents a district near Detroit. "An
entire state is hanging in the
balance."

Forget FAFSA

You know the real Roland. I have done nothing
wrong, and I have absolutely nothing to hide,"
- Illinois Senator Ronald Burris, on the Senate Ethics Committee investigation regarding his conversations
with aides to former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, as reported yesterday by the New York Times.

New proposal would simplify aid application for students to the polls to elect the 120
ly af s s members of the Knesset from

Jn a 2006 report, the Commission on the Future of Higher Edu-
cation said that for atypical household, completingthe Federal
Application for Student Aid is longer and more complicated
than completing the federal tax return. The report also said that
people considered the FAFSA to be onerous and confusing. It's these
disheartening qualities of the FAFSA that prohibit many students
from applying for much-needed aid. But thanks to University of
Michigan researcher Susan Dynarski and her colleagues, this tire-
some process could be simplified. To ensure that more students who
need financial aid are going to get it, the federal government should
start by instituting the simple change that Dynarski recommended.

The FAFSA is five pages long and has
127 questions. Until now, the form had to
be filled after tax returns are filed. High
school students who apply to college in fall
had to wait until the spring of that year to
see what kind of aid they would receive.
This is inconvenient for students because
financial aid can be the "make or break"
factor for many students when deciding
which university they will attend, and
making that decision without knowledge
of how much aid to expect is difficult.
In response to this situation, Univer-
sity of Michigan Public Policy Prof. Susan
Dynarski and her colleagues came up with
a simple solution - a check-off box on
tax returns that will replace much of the
FAFSA. With this change, parents would
be able to use incomes from prior years for
a quick online estimate of how much aid
their child would receive. Dynarski main-
tains that most of the data on the FAFSA
is unnecessary or already on the IRS Form
1040. This solution could increase the
number of applicants by making the pro-
cess easier.
And that's an important change. Dynar-
ski's research also found that low-income
families have more difficulty completing

the FAFSA. Two-thirds of low-income stu-
dents have no Internet access at home, half
don't have a parent who previously attend-
ed college and 13 percent don't speak Eng-
lish at home. The proposed change would
make it easier for these students to apply
for financial aid, and would consequently
offer them greater access to a college edu-
cation. Low-income students deserve the
opportunities that a college education
presents, and they are dependent upon
receiving financial aid to get there.
But while making the process easier is a
good start, this change would not solve all
the shortcomings in the financial aid pro-
cess.
The University needs to be able to offer
more financial aid at such a difficult time
for Michigan families. Simplifying the pro-
cess is one positive change, but efforts to
provide increased financial aid are also an
important part of providing low-income
families with better access to education.
Despite other needed changes regard-
ing financial aid, the government needs to
implement Dynarski's idea as soon as pos-
sible, putting an end to one of the worst
headaches for high school students apply-
ing to college.

among 34 par-
ties running in the
election. Although
the centrist Kadi-
ma Party, led by
Tzipi Livni, took
the most seats of
any party at 28 and
leads the rightist
Likudtby a single IBRAHIM
seat, it is unlikely
that Livni will be KAKWAN
able to form a gov-
ernment, which
requires a coalition represented by at
least'61 seats. Instead, it seems likely
that the responsibility of forming
a government will fall to Benjamin
Netanyahu and a coalition of right-
wing parties.
Yet despite the hawkish attitudes so
widespread in the rightist parties, the
latest election will not result in a sud-
den escalation of violence nor does it
represent a desire for the greater use
of military force among tsraelis.
To begin with, the number of par-
tiesgainingseats intheKnessetmeans
that many differing viewpoints will
be represented. The party that won
the third-highest number of seats is
Yisrael Beytenu with 15, which sup-
ports a two-state solution for Israel
and Palestine and whose support
will be crucial to the formation of'a
coalition government. In 2005, this
party campaigned to transfer control
of majority Arab lands from Israel to
the Palestinian Authority in exchange
for official Israeli control of the more
populous settlements. Sure, this pro-
posal wasn't exactly what either side
wanted - and it failed - but it was an
attempt at a compromise. More than

that, it represented a better deal for
the Palestinians, who in the past have
received nothing in return for land
taken for the construction of settle-
ments, and it demonstrated Beytenu's
support of negotiations.
And now Beytenu is expected to
play a key role inthe new government.
Evenonissues ofdomestic importance
to secular Israelis, their participation
will play a role toward curbing the
influence of the Ultra-Orthodox par-
ties such as the Sephardi SHAS (win-
ning 11 seats and expected to be part
of the right-wing coalition) which in
the past has promoted the banning of
numerous activities during the Sha-
bat in accordance with orthodox Jew-
ish tradition, and which promotes
the greater disbursement of welfare,
particularly to students at religious
universities.
And then there is Likud itself. In
2000, then-Likud leader Ariel Sha-
ron touched off the second Intifada,
a nearly six-year Palestinian upris-
ing, by going for prayers at a mosque
complex. However, in the following
years, Sharon abandoned the idea
of "Greater Israel", in which Israel
would retain complete control of the
West Bank and Gaza. It was also Sha-
ron who pushed through the "unilat-
eral disengagement" which resulted
in the evacuation of 21 settlements in
Gaza, and four in the West Bank. Of
course, it was this action that caused
Kadima to split off from Likud in the
first place. And in the years since
the Six-Day War of 1967, the various
Likud governments have relinquished
nearly 90 percent of the lands taken
during that conflict.
There has also been talk of a coali-
tion government led by Netanyahu,
but including Kadima members,
with possible Kadima appointments

as Ministers of Defense and Foreign
Affairs. The inclusion of Kadima
would serve to moderate the policies
of the new government, even if the
government as a whole would have a
right-of-center leaning.
And this does not even consider
a potential role for the leftist Labor
party. Although it is unclear what
Why Likud's wins
are nothing to
worry about.
role, if any, it will play, with 13 seats in
the Knesset, there is a chance (though
slim) that they will be included in a
compromise.
At the end of the day, the results
of the election do not show a rejec-
tion of peace. Granted, in the wake
of the recent conflict, increased sup-
port for the right is expected though
the spread in the allotment of votes
argues against awidespread desire for
an ultra hard-line stance with respect
to Palestine. Even the right-wing par-
ties elected have, in the past, shown
an ability to reach compromise, and
those that are centrist or left of center
still account for a large percentage of
the total number of seats.
Most reassuring of all, the only two
parties that continue to support the
idea of a "Greater Israel," which is in
direct opposition to a two-state solu-
tion, managed to take a total of only
seven seats.

Recently I found myself gathered with a
group of students who I knew of, but hadn't
met. We shared no common background - our
differences seemed to outweigh our common-
alities. We are from different sides of ideo-
logical divides, different parts of the country,
different backgrounds and a variety of campus
organizations. But we were united by one key
element: frustration. There was a sense that
although we were proud of our individual work
in our student groups and among our peers, the
larger student body deserved better.
There is a group that has the power to affect
every student, yet in recent years has become
complacent. The potential of the Michigan Stu-
dent Assembly outweighs its product by a large
margin. This has been apparent not merely to
some of those who served, albeit briefly, in the
assembly itself, but a sentiment that has been
rightfully articulated on these pages and among
the most xdisinterested of students. Students
don't need campaign promises of cheaper text-
books and meetings with the administration
for the sake of meeting - they need a student
government whose accomplishments and fail-
ures are visible and clear. Michigan students
need a new vision.
You might think that this diverse group of
students would have trouble finding a vision
they could all agree to, and that different views
would produce conflict. Upon assuming the
post of message chairman for the Michigan
Vision Party, 1 thought I would have one of the
hardest tasks of my college career ahead of me.
How could I present a unified vision that rep-
resented so many perspectives? I am pleased to
find that while my job isn't easy, our message
carries a special sort of resonance.
This vision is founded on two core principles:
transparency and accountability. The majority
of us gathered together that Wednesday never
saw our future in MSA. We didn't want to be
HARUN BUULJNA

a part of the problem. But when we talked to
each another and others, we found that more
students see that they can be a part of the solu-
tion. Better student involvement is the only way
to accomplish our goals of a more transparent
and accountable assembly.
To be a part of the solution is not to be satis-
fied with winning an election. March 19 is only
day one of the task ahead. Though I chronicled
our beginning, we want to be clear about one
thing: a vision is an open-ended, guiding set
of principles. If we believe MSA is to be held
accountable, we must begin these tasks by
holding ourselves accountable. As one of my
responsibilities as message chair, I will ensure
that each one of our candidates has a plan not
just during but also after the election. If they
do not follow through on a campaign promise, I
will be the first to let you know.
In order for this to succeed, we won't allow
our involvement to be stagnant or complacent
and assume the current character of the assem-
bly's dominant party. We are not a movement
that is interested merely in repackaging and
recycling.
When our members come to us with resolu-
tions, I will be asking: How does this improve
our accountability and transparency to the stu-
dent body? How does this proposal reflect an
achievable student concern? There is only one
group they need to be accountable to, and that's
the studentbody. I want to do my part to ensure
that this happens.

gram? Please go to our forum, VisionTalk, at

A gr"eled-fueled cultureU

As I recently walked down State
St., I noticed a homeless man
on the sidewalk, his knees
exposed through _
giant holes in his
jeans. The sight of
his ragged pants
brought my atten-
tion to the well-tai-
lored, department
store-bought jeans
I was wearing as I -
passed him. It filled MATTHEW
me with enormousG
guilt as I thought GREEN
that had I given the-
homeless man the
money that I had paid for my jeans, it
may have paid for a few weeks worth
of his food. And while buying marked-
up denim wasn't an act of malice, it
was undeniably greedy.
When it comes to the recent eco-
nomic meltdown, greed has argu-
ably played its biggest role yet. Each
day, the headlines illuminate a story
of self-indulgence that ranges from
Wall Street and Madoff to the shady
tax practices of D.C. insiders. And
though the writing is on the wall, I
sometimes doubt that anyone's read-
ing it. '
Greed will remain part of our
culture so long as it continues to be
taught early to generations of future
leaders. One need not look further
than to the many freshmen currently
enrolled in introductory econom-
ics courses here in Ann Arbor. The
majority of these students are hoping
to be admitted into the prestigious
Ross School of Business, to which
thousands will apply in the coming
weeks, in hopes of someday running

a Fortune 500 company.
But perhaps if they were looking
to u'se their economic powers to do
something good, those financial wiz-
ards might consider the Ford School
of Public Policy. Despite the fact that
the Ford School is one of the highest-
ranked public policy programs in the
country, only about 150 University
undergrads apply each year. Evident-
ly, learning how to better society is
less appealing than learning how to
make yourself rich.
Of course, there's nothing wrong
with wanting to be wealthy. On the
contrary, the desire to amass wealth
is quite possibly the single greatest
driving force that keeps the economy
moving. But as a result of so many
brilliant minds focusing on making
as much money as possible, resources
are grossly limited in sectors apart
from business and finance. Govern-
ment, for instance, is debilitated
because there is a shortage of great
intellect in the public sector. As a
result, the character of our legisla-
tors struggles to live up to those of
our history's political heroes.
Perhaps if the best and the bright-
est were encouraged to go into pub-
lic policy years ago, rather than into
more self-serving careers, then the
current debate on Capital Hill would
be different. In that case, maybe
legislators would see themselves
above petty partisanship, embody-
ing something academic rather than
something prejudiced. It seems logi-
cal that if we want a smarter govern-
ment, intellectual people must be
compelled to enter into government
positions.
That is not to say that there are no

born leaders or geniuses currently
in Washington. There are indeed a
handful of great members of Con-
gress on the Hill, but less than stel-
lar legislators outnumber that group
by far. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg
of the U.S. Supreme Court comes to
mind as an example of a public ser-
vant at her finest. Though she will
probably soon retire, the leadership 4
she has shown on the Court has been
outstanding.

Students should
focus on more
than getting rich.

4

And in the White House, President
Obama'spolitical prowess hasyetto be
seen, but Istill have hope. Specifically,
I have hope in his power to motivate
intelligent young people tobe interest-
ed in politics to the point where they
ignore the fact that a career in polities
might not be the highest paying.
New intellect needs to funnel into
Washington to ensure quality gover-
nance for the future. In order for that
to happen, people have to believe that
making money is accessory to mak-
ing the world better. Greed may have
worked for a while on Wall Street, but
that clearly failed.
And in the ensuing years, greed
won't cut it for Washington.

TWELVE BOLD PREDICTIONS
THE DAILY HOCKEY WRITERS WEIGH IN ON HOW
MICHIGAN WILL FARE DOWN THE STRETCH

MICHAEL EISENSTEIN
Sophomore forward Matt Rust and senior forward Travis Turnbull
will both score at least 10 goals in the regular season. They have seven
and eight right now, respectively.
Michigan will not let up another power-play goal the rest of the
regular season. Recently, the Wolverines' penalty-kill unit has been
overwhelmingly dominant, and is currently second-best in the CCHA
with a 90.5 kill percentage.
Miller will score a pair of goals against Notre Dame in the CCHA
Championship game and be named CCHA Tournament MVP. Miller
scored all four of his goals last season at Joe Louis Arena, where the
CCHA playoff semifinals and finals are played. Playing on the top line,
Miller is playing sone of his best hockey right now.
NICOLE AUERBACH
Sophomore forward Louie Caporusso (22 goals) will leapfrog Air
Force's Jacques Lamoureux (25) to finish the season as the nation's
top goal scorer. The Wolverines' Hobey Baker Award hopeful is due for
a hot streak - just in time for the end of the regular season.
Sophomore third-string goaltender Shawn Hunwick will play in net
in the Feb. 28 regular season finale against Ferris State at Yost Ice
Arena. The Wolverines will likely have their CCHA Tournament seed-
ing determined before the game. Expect an easy victory over the Bull-
dogs, and look for Hunwick to make his second career appearance.
Michigan will win the national championship. The Wolverines are on
a tear, winning 14 of their last 16 games, including a sweep of No. 5
Miami (Ohio) and a victory at No. 2 Notre Dame. Their slew of qual-
ity wins solidifies one of the most impressive resumes in the country,
which puts them in prime position for a title run.

Matt Rust will have a hat trick sometime during the last four regu-
lar-season games. He's been on fire since returning from the World
Junior Championships, and is currently tied with sophomore forward
Carl Hagelin and freshman forward Luke Glendening for the most
lamp-lighters since the start of January (five goals apiece).
Louie Caporusso will score at least 30 goals by the end of the post-
season. He's got 22 now , and when he scores, they usually come in
pairs (or bunches). A couple more multi-goal games will do the trick.
Michigan's fourth line will score the game-winning goal in the CCHA
Championship game to defeat Notre Dame. The third and fourth lines
have tallied crucial goals in recent weeks, and both lines have great
chemistry.
Senior goaltender Billy Sauer will see significant playing time before
the season ends. Michigan coach Red Berenson has said that he plans
on having both Sauer and sophomore goaltender Bryan Hogan ready
for the playoffs, and Hogan has very limited playoff experience.
Freshman Brandon Burlon will end the season by leading Wolverine
defensemen in points. Burlon has 13, trailing both junior Chris Sum-
mers and sophomore Chad Langlais, who each have 16. Burlon has
been hot lately and has four of his five goals in the second half of the
season.
Michigan won't play in the Grand Rapids bracket, since it will lose to
Notre Dame in the CCH A finals. The Fighting Irish are just too good for
the Wolverines to beat come tournament time. Instead, the Wolverines
will chase their NCAA dreams in Minneapolis.

Sophomore Carl Hagelin is tied for the teamlead in goals since the start of January.

'M' opens Big Ten season

Benson and Reynolds must lead
way for Blue offense against MSU

Dominating victory
is eighth straight
over rival Spartans
By GILAD BERKOWITZ
Daily Sports Writer
When the competitive Big Ten
schedule officially opened for the
No. 18 Michigan women's tennis
team yesterday, sophomore Rika
Tatsuno and the team were pre-
pared for battle.
A week removed from receiv-
ing Big Ten Athlete of the Week,
Tatsuno was in the win column
again yesterday. This time, she
helped propel the Wolverines to
their second straight 7-0 victory
i and eighth straight victory over
in-state rival Michigan State.
"People are going to start to
notice her," Michigan coach Ron-
nie Bernstein said. "I would not
be surprised if she popped into
the national rankings when they
come out tomorrow."
Tatsuno improved her singles
record to 4-2 by beating Spartan
sophomore Manon Noe 6-3, 6-2.
Last Tuesday, the Big Ten office
announced Tatsuno as the Athlete
of the Week after she recorded a
combined 4-0 record in singles
and doubles against both Yale and
No. 14 Notre Dame.
Tatsuno's wins included an
impressive straight-set victory

Sophomore Rika Tatsuno's singles win helped Michigan win its Big Ten opener.

over Notre Dame's 39th-ranked
Kristy Frilling.
"If she keeps playing the way
she is, she is going to win more
(awards)," Bernstein said. "It's
great because right now, she is
just gaining more and more con-
fidence."
The Wolverines secured the all-
important doubles point behind
the duo of freshman Michelle
Sulahian and sophomore Whit-
ney Taney. Taney, who has proven
to be a major asset in doubles play
this year, has posted a 4-1 record
at the No. 2 position. She is also
1-0 at No. 1.
"Whitney has really bought
into the Michigan program,"
Bernstein said. "She is just such
a great listener and competitor in

both singles and doubles."
Senior Chisako Sugiyama also
improved her singles record,
earning a close win against
Michigan State senior Stephanie
Kehler, 7-5, 3-6, 10-4. Kehler, who
Bernstein said was an "aggressive
baseliner," was the only Michigan
State player to beat a Wolverine
last season in East Lansing.
For the young Wolverines,
the win to open the Big Ten sea-
son will serve as a confidence
booster heading into the heart of
the spring season. The Wolver-
ines will take a brief break from
Big Ten play and head to Coral
Gables, Fla. to face off against the
No. 15 Miami Hurricanes next
Thursday.

forward Carly michigandaily.
Benson said the cow
Wolverines are
changing their game plan tonight
in East Lansing.
"We're gonna make some of our
shots," she said.
Benson meant it as a joke, but it's
a pretty solid prediction. Since the
Michigan State game, Michigan's
shooting has drastically improved
The team's field-goal percentage

has increased 6.7 percent and its
3-point shooting has increased 6.1
percent.
Part of the reason for improve-
ment in shooting percentage has
been the emergence of freshman
forward Carmen Reynolds. Reyn-
olds has established herself as a
versatile offensive threat both in
the paint and behind the arc. She
has the team's best 3-point per-
centage.
"Carmen's been playing great,"
sophomore guard Veronica Hicks
said. "We're looking forward to
her stepping it up."
Reynolds' presence inside has
taken some of the scoring burden
off Benson, who is shooting 45
percent from beyond the arc since
the last Michigan State game.
Michigan will look to Reynolds to
establish herself in the post once
again.
This doesn't mean Michigan
coach Kevin Borseth doesn't
want his players to shoot. He has
stressed all year that he has no
problem with his players shooting
"rhythm shots."
"He definitely wants us to shoot
if we're open," Reynolds said. "But
when you pound it inside, it opens
up passes to the wings and things

happen."
Against the Spartans (11-3 Big
Ten, 18-7 overall), that's easier
said than done. Boastingone of the
biggest frontcourts in the Big Ten,
Michigan State leads the confer-
ence in rebounding and blocked
shots.
A big reason for that is 6-foot-9
center Allyssa DeHaan, who is the
second-leading shot-blocker in the
Big Ten.
DeHaan scored 12 points against
Michigan last month, six of which
came on free throws.
After their last run-in with the
Spartans, the emotions of the rival-
ry spilled over and a few Michigan
players had tears in their eyes.
"We definitely look forward to
this game," Hicks said. "This year,
we've made it known that we come
to play."
But Borseth, in his second year
in Ann Arbor, said he person-
ally doesn't put it above any other
game.
"I think if you're not aware that
Michigan and Michigan State has
a tradition, you need to get out
from underneath that rock,"' he
said. "We're not trying to do any-
thing more than win a basketball
game."

The conference consisted of
a panel with notable speakers,
including actress Natalie Port-
man, two smaller sessions about
nonprofit organizations and a CGI
U exchange that allowed the par-'
ticipants to get information about
each other's organizations.
Cohen said he was happy to get
the chance to share his project
with others at the conference.
"We are proud of our projects
but we're so engulfed in it that to
back up and view it from an unbi-
ased perspective and to see the
validation from others was excit-
ing," he said. "We saw really posi-
tive reactions."
Weinberg said seeing reac-
tions from the other participants
cemented hisbeliefthatthey"were
on the right track."
"The best part of it was that we
got positive reactions from every-
one, including other students,
directors of other large nonprof-
its and even former President
Clinton," he said. "That the pro-
gram can be well received by such
a wide range of people is really
encouraging."

specific stem cell lines, which will
help Michigan catch up to the stem
cell developments in other states.
"You have to admit that Michi-
gan is behind, and so in order for
us to compete at all, we're looking
for a hook that would (make a) dif-
ference or something unique, and
we're going to try to do that using
disease models," O'Shea said.

many diseases including Hunting-
ton's disease and Lou Gehrig's dis-
ease.
However, to make new stem cell
lines and establish the consortium,
researchers are relying on dona-
tions from private entities.
INNOCENCE CLINIC
From Page 1A
of wrongful conditions because of
DNA," said Bridget McCormack,
co-director of the clinic and asso-
ciate dean of the Law School, in a
phone interview last week. "This
suggests that the rate of wrongful
convictions without DNA evidence
may be just as high, if not higher,
than those with DNA evidence."
McCormack and Law Prof. David
Moran, the other co-director, began
receiving letters from incarcerated
prisoners around the state who
hoped their cases would be exam-
ined by the new clinic, with more
than 2,000 arriving in their mail-
boxes since July.
The prisoners then filled out a
19-page questionnaire, which was
developed by the directors as a way
for them to sift through the cases
and determine which ones they
would pursue further, Moran said.
Out of the thousands of cases, six
eventually were picked to comprise
the clinic's first batch and then
assigned to law students.
Moran said the Reeds' case is a
perfect example of the problems
with criminal justice system.
He said the same mistakes are
being made "case after case," and
can be broken down into six main
factors: incorrect eyewitness
accounts, false confessions, flawed
science, faulty defense lawyering
and jailhouse snitching.
The case of Lorinda Swain,
another one of the clinic's inaugu-
ral six, is an example of what Moran
calls one of the leading causes of
wrongful convictions - overreli-
ance on jailhouse testimony.
Swain was convicted of crimi-
nal sexual misconduct in 2001 for
allegedly having oral sex with her
adoptive son.
The prosecutors on Swain's case
relied solely on the testimony of an

"Funds are needed to make new
human embryonic stem cell lines,
but that does not mean public
funds," Smith said. "Our goals are
to initiate work under Prop. 2 with
funds provided by philanthropists
or donors."
O'Shea said the researchers are
also anticipating friendly decisions
from President Barack Obama con-
cerning federal stem cell funding.
"We're still working with the
directive that even though we can
derive stem cell lines, we can't do it
with (National Institutes of Health)
money," O'Shea said. "Until that
changes, and I expect it will, we're
still bound by the previous presiden-
tial directive of President Bush."
Universitystemcellresearchersare
also eagerlywaitingObama'sremoval
of the presidential ban that currently
exists on stem cell work that was put
in place by President Bush.
Officials at the consortium are
incarcerated woman who had been
convicted more than 20 times for
various charges, including embez-
zlement, Moran said.
"Whenever this woman went to
jail, she always claimed to overhear
somebody make a full confession to
whatever the prosecution needed
them to confess to," he said. "The
Department of Corrections had a
notation in this woman's file that
she was not to be trusted. And she
was the prosecution's star witness."
This practice, coined "jailhouse
snitching," often results in deals
and dropped charges for the pris-
oner who testifies.
The clinic not only benefits pris-
oners like Swain and the Reeds, but
also gives law students hands-on
experience since they do most of
the work for the clinic.
"What you don't learn in a stan-
dard lav school class is how to
actually try a real case," Moran
said. "(Students) really become the
attorneys for the clients."
Student responsibilities include
communicating with witnesses and
clients, gathering facts, visiting the
crime scene, writing persuasive
motions and briefs for the judge and
making appearances in court.
Judd Grutman, a second-year
law student who works in the Inno-
cence Clinic, said he enjoys apply-
ing his classroom knowledge to
actual cases.
"It's exciting and incredibly
rewarding," he said. "We have all
appreciated that you feel like you
are putting what you have learned
to use."
In light of Michigan's incarcera-
tion rate, which is 10 percent higher
than the national average, directors
and students at the clinic see the
need for information about unjust
convictions to be made public.
"Common police practices, by no
fault of their own, often end up not
getting the right person," said third-
year Lawstudent Mary Hanna-Weir,

also working to inform the public
about how they can donate their
embryos.
Smith said he often receives
phone calls from people in and out-
side Michigan, asking where they
can donate their embryos.
"We look at this as an opportu-
nity tobe able to inform the public
and medical health professionals as
to where and how they can donate
their embryos to embryonic stem
cell research," he said.
Feldman said that as things
start to come together for stem
cell research in Michigan, medical
advancements can't be far away.
"Between the passage of Propos-
al 2 and the lifting of the previous
presidential restrictions of stem
cell research, I know we'll really
be able to accomplish a great deal
of very meaningful stem cell-based
medical research in Michigan," she
said.
who works in the clinic. "There's a
lot that could be done, and it's good
to have a more grounded under-
standing of where the problems are
so that we can fix them."
Moran called the criminal jus-
tice system "too inaccurate" and
said the cases the Innocence Clinic
is working on could be used to push
for reforms in eyewitness interro-
gation procedures and crime labs.
Zoe Levine, a third-year law stu-
dent who is working on the Reeds'
case, said in an e-mail that she's
"outraged by what has happened
to the Reeds and to other innocent
defendants." She said she's excited
for the opportunity to "expose
some of the systemic problems" in
the criminal justice system.
In the Reeds' case, Levine inves-
tigated the conflicting eyewitness
testimony, which identified Tyrone
Allen, a now deceased man from
Detroit, as an alternate suspect.
. Witnesses said they saw Allen
near the source of the gunshots
when they were fired. In addition,
Moran said police failed to provide
some keyinformationtothedefense
- Allen's girlfriend said the day
Gholston was shot, Allen had told
her that he committed the crime.
Allen was killed in Detroit after
the Reeds' trial took place, and the
gun he was carrying at the time of
his deathwasconfirmedtohave fired
the bulletthat paralyzed Gholston.
"(Gholston) blamed the Reeds
because he had alongstanding feud
with DeShawn Reed," Moran said.
"But knowing what he knows now,
even he no longer believes that they
did it."
The Reeds have spent eight years
in prison, and during that time, Ghol-
ston has formally admitted three
times that his testimony was false,
something that Moran views as cru-
cial to proving the Reeds' innocence.
"We are cautiously optimistic
that we will be getting those guys
out," he said.

"I'm talking about with the past,

During a question-and-answer
session, students asked how the
campaign would make MSA more
transparent after the election and

"We're trying to help students

more likely to get done."
The reMichigan campaign
formed in the wake of the dissolu-

the leading party in the past several

thought reMichigan seemed to be
more inclusive than past parties.
"This is the first party that

said.
Though he supports the reMich-
igan campaign, LSA junior Vishal
Bajaj said he thinks both parties
are presenting insightful platforms,
which he thinks will promote
healthy competition.
"I saw that both parties were
doing the right thing. I like bring-
ing back competition to MSA," he
said. "One of the things I hated was
the one-party system, but the big-
gest thing for me is that both par-

FROM WALK-ONS TO CAPTAINS

4

Fifth-year seniors
Lee and Merritt lead
the Wolverines with
hard work and heart
By JASON KOHLER
Daily Sports Writer
Before last Tuesday's game
againstthen-No. 9 Michigan State,
fifth-year senior guard C.J. Lee
strutted across the court during
warmups, yelling to teammates,
"Let's go! Let's go!"
Nearby, fellow fifth-year
senior David Merritt sternly went
through the rhythm of the pre-
game routine: drive to the basket,
make a layup, run back in line.
As game time neared, Lee and
Merritt headed to center court for
the captains' meeting with the ref-
erees.
The scene was a little unusual,
considering the two walk-ons had
just three combined seasons on the
Michigan roster. But at the start of
the season, Merritt and Lee some-
how found themselves almost
unanimously elected as captains
of the Michigan men's basketball
team.
The only votes they didn't
receive were their own.
DREAM SCHOOL
In the spring of 2006, Lee typed
out an e-mail and pushed send.
He had gotten his release from
Manhattan College, where he com-
pleted two years as a backup point
guard. After corresponding with
then-Michigan assistant coach
Chuck Swenson, he decided to give
up his scholarship in New York and
walk on to the Wolverines.
"I just went for it," Lee said. "It
was always my dream. I coudn't
pass up on my dream."
Lee was born in Saginaw and
spent 11 years in Lansing before
moving to Pittsford, NY.
From the first time Lee's high
school coach saw the young point
guard play, he knew Lee was some-
thing special.
"I walked into the gym and sat
in the stands and watched, and
here's this kid running the point,"
said John Nally, the basketball
coach at Pittsford Sutherland
High School. "This freshman, tell-
ing everyone where to go, getting

people organized, moving the ball
around, running the point like he
was a senior."
Nally's fondest memory was
watching the guard score nine
points in less than a minute,
including a half-court shot, to win
a game. Lee's teammates carried
him off the court on their shoul-
ders.
When it came time for college,
the six-foot guard wasn't high-
ly recruited. He was offered an
opportunityto walk on at Michi-
gan but instead took a scholarship
offer from Manhattan.
"We saw something in him that
schools out there, for whatever
reason, didn't think he was good
enough," then-Manhattan coach
Bobby Gonzalez said. "C.J was
a winner. He was going to be our
point guard and captain."
Lee spent two seasons at Man-
hattan, where he averaged just 4.3
minutes per game before Gonza-
lez left to become the Seton Hall
head coach. The coaching change
prompted Lee to send an e-mail to
the Michigan coaching staff.
A few months later, he packed
his bags for Ann Arbor.
TRY, TRY, TRY AGAIN
It took Merritt three years to.
make the team.
The first time he got cut, he was
disappointed. The second time,
frustrated. The third time, when
he finally earned a spot, relief.
"It was really horrible, actu-
ally, because I thought I was good
enough to be on the team," Mer-
ritt said of his two failed tries.
"I thought I had pretty good try-
outs. I felt that I had worked hard
enough throughout the summers,
coming for open gyms, showing
that I really cared about being on
the team."
Merritt turned down his only
scholarship offer, from Division-
II Hillsdale, and decided to train
year-round to prepare himself for
the Michigan tryout. Every sum-
mer morning, he lifted weights,
then spent hours in the gym play-
ing basketball.
By his junior year, he had one
last shot. Merritt promptly had
what he described as his worst
workout.
Despite that, he never had
doubts about making the team.
"Merritt is a classic example of
sticking with it, having a fire and

ein, who was a walk-on at Wheel-
ing Jesuit in 1971, respected their
intensity and work ethic.
"I think we bring an older men-
tality, this mentality that we're
going to come in everyday and
work as hard as we can," Merritt
said. "Our only concern is win-
ning. Me and C.J. aren't concerned
about how many points we score
or how many minutes.we get. We
want to do everything to see this
team win."
But winning didn't come natu-
rally. Despite their maturity, the
duo lacked on-court experience.
Last season, Michigan limped its
way to a school-record-22 losses.
Lee started in seven games and
saw the court in every contest,
while Merritt made 20 appearanc-
es in the team's 32 games.
All season, Lee and Merritt did
their best to lift the spirits of the
deflated team.
"They keep us going when guys
come in and guys don't feel like
going and things are going wrong,"
Shepherd said. "You always hear
(C.J.) speaking and we laugh about
it, like 'C, when you going to stop
talking?' He's told us plenty of
times he's not going to stop speak-
ing until he leaves here."
Although Lee is known as the
loudmouth, Merritt is known for
lightinga fire under his teammates.
Before Michigan's 81-73 win over
then-No. 4 Duke in December, Bei-
lein called on the West Bloomfield
native to give the pep talk.
Lee's pep talks, on the other
hand, are never ending. He talks
throughout practice, when he's
leaving the court, on the way out
to the parking lot and on his way
back into practice the next day.
When Michigan had a 7 a.m. wake-
up call for the Iowa game, Shep-
herd said Lee was the first one up
and talking.
Lee will often stand up from his
seat on the bench when Michigan
is on defense, put his hands in the
air as if he's on the court and bark
orders to his teammates.
"In the locker room,'his demean-
or is so intense for our guys that
we don't go into any games unpre-
pared because we have another
coach in the locker room as well,"
Beilein said.
In his pregame speech before
the Michigan State game, Beilein
pulled out a ring commemorating
one of his teams that made the

NCAA Tournament.
"It means so much to me to have
teams get one of these - an NCAA
ring," Beilein said. "I want one
with an 'M' on it. I don't want it
for me. Our coaching staff doesn't
want it. We want it for you because
you've worked so hard."
From the front of the room, Lee
unconsciously responded, "Yes,
sir."
He just couldn't stay quiet.
DO IT FOR 'US'
At the beginning of this season,
Lee and Merritt received scholar-
ships - an honor the two didn't
take lightly.
"You want to reassure (the
coaches) that, 'Yes, I made the
right decision,' " Lee said of being
awarded the scholarship. "That's
something Dave and I do everyday
is to go out and prove that we're
here, and we're here to stay. ...
People like to use the word 'walk-
on' as if you're not as deserving
of a scholarship, and I've never
referred to Dave or myself as a
walk-on, because we are both
deserving to be in this place."
For the two fifth-year seniors,
the only way to reassure their
coaches is to win.
It doesn't matter that the duo
has started a combined 19 of Mich-
igan's 26 games, or that Lee has
seen the most playing time of his
career.
None of it mattered after Michi-
gan lost 54-42 at home against
the Spartans, its seventh loss in
nine games. And despite every-
thing Merritt and Lee have done
throughout their careers, they still
feel they haven't done enough.
Following that game, Merritt
sat near his locker, solemnly look-
ing on as Lee took questions from
the press.
Lee's voice cracked, his throat
sore from yelling encouragement
to his teammates and vomiting
into a trash can during a timeout.
Yet he still played 37 minutes. He
issued a challenge to his team-
mates.
"Maybe I have to put more pres-
sure on guys," Lee said. "But we
don't have a staff that does that.
I'm not the kind of leader to do
that, but if that's what it takes,
that's what I'm going to have to
do it. ... because we have seven
(games) to answer this bell, and if
we don't do it, shame on us."

Fifth-year senior C.J. Lee has become a vocal leader for Michigan asa former walk-on.

a passion," Indiana coach Tom
Crean said in a teleconference in
January. "He's going to be a heck
of a motivational speaker someday
when it comes down to how to live
your dreams."
After finally making the team,
Merritt got introduced to the
walk-on guard from. New York,
who, despite being the newcomer,
wouldn't shut his mouth. From
there, Lee and Merritt spent
the season fighting for a spot on
Tommy Amaker's squad.
But at the end of the season, Lee
once again faced the scenario of a
head coach leaving the program.
FILLING THE VACUUM
When Michigan coach John

Beilein was hired, Lee and Mer-
ritt had no idea what their role
as walk-ons would be in the new
regime. Lee had yet to play a min-
ute for Michigan after sitting out
for a year because of NCAA trans-
fer rules and Merritt had played in
just four games as a Wolverine.
As players began to drop from
the program, leaving then-senior
Ron Coleman and current senior
Jevohn Shepherd as the only
upperclassmen aside from the
walk-ons, it created a leadership
vacuum.
And although they were new to
the team, the outspoken Lee and
the iron-willed Merritt were in
natural positions to step up. No
one had worked harder. And Beil-

nook in State Street's Shaman

His book, titled "Rock Bottom," is a sharp
and biting mock-autobiography about

of his grungy jaded rocker protagonist,
Shilling - a recent Master of Fine Arts
graduate and now Sweetland lecturer -

frontman.
Events like this are not uncommon in
Ann Arbor. While the city is known for
sports venues like Michigan Stadium and
music venues like Hill Auditorium, there
is still another very overlooked culture
that pervades the town - a writing cul-
ture.
The literary scene that exists in Ann
Arbor is vibrant. More than just a scene,
individual writers living and working
in Ann Arbor have formed a commu-
nity. While the modern concept of social
networking conjures the image of Face-
book's home page, concerts, plays and
book readings exist as a form of social
networking where people can physically
come together over common interests.
These communities encourage individu-
als to collaborate and share their art and
their ideas.
"By definition, community is a collec-

tive," said English Prof. Nicholas Del-
banco, director of the Hopwood Awards.
"It's true in this community of individu-
als. Readings, workshops and bookstores
like Shaman Drum are places where peo-
ple congregate. However, community is
a multi-pronged instrument that doesn't
exist in only one place."
Fueled by the abundance of talent
attracted to the university's writing pro-
gram, Ann Arbor is a haven for writers.
As a result, they have formed a network
that is visible and accessible. This net-
work is made up of writers and readers,
students and professors. From social
chatter at Hopwood tea gatherings on
Thursday afternoons in Angell Hall to
experimental readings at Crazy Wisdom
Bookstore and Tea Room on Main Street,
it's evident that this community is thriv-
ing.
Delbanco compared teaching at the
University of Michigan to his experience
working as a professor in New York City
at Columbia University. He stressed the
role that physical distance plays in com-
munity - rather than commuting via
public transit in New York City, writers
in Ann Arbor live within close proxim-
ity of the campus. This factors into the
fact that writers in Ann Arbor simply see
each other more often.
Book readings in particular are one
way that new and seasoned writers con-
nect not only with one another but also
with their audience. While reading and

writing are often individual practices,
these events spur thoughts about them
being living physical processes and invite
the students and Ann Arbor citizens to
be a part of an active community.
The Zell Visiting Writers Series, spon-
sored by the University's EnglishDepart-
ment and the Office of the Provost,
brings writers from the national literary
scene to the small stage at campus ven-
ues including Rackham Amphitheatre
and the Residential College Auditorium.

including British poet Simon Armitage,
short-story writer Deborah Eisenberg

present and provide an opportunity for
readers and listeners to experience writ-
ing in another dimension through oral
storytelling.

READING
This Thursday, Jewish
poet Hamutal Bar-Yosef
will enact what may
be the most exotic and
artistically full poetry
reading of the year. Yosef
is the award-winning
poet of nine collections
and several academic
books and one of the
most visible and cel-
ebrated Israeli poets of-
our age. The reading will
be held at 202 S. Thayer,

O6
Danielle Abrams
Assistant Professor, School tofArt & Design
Which works of art influenced
you the most?
"Bliz-aard Ball Sale" by David Hammons: In New York, there's a lot of
street sellers, particularly in more of the working class neighborhoods. I'm
not sure what neighborhood exactly, but it was a place where you'd expect to
see street sellers, and (Hammons) sold beautifully constructed snowballs (as a
street performer).
Anything John Waters: I love "Polyester" and "Pink Flamingos." When I
first started making art, I realized, wow, I could really make work about raunchy
stuff, and it could have a lot of meaning. The things in society that people all do,
and all know about and talk about - but it has become taboo in high culture.
"Flesh," "Trash" and "Heat" by Paul Morrissey and Andy Warhol: For
very personal reasons. I grew up in the early '70s in New York - there were
junkies on the street. Their existence was a response to the crisis we were hav-
ing. I love the way Warhol and Paul Morrissey made these films (about that).
Usually you can rent these in the cult sections.
"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test" by Tom Wolfe: I'm interested in the
underbelly of culture. What happens when you scratch off the veneer of cleanli-
ness? Purity. And you get to something that's really about the crust: the banal.
Fluevog Shoes: Designed in Vancouver - Fluevog shoes are very clunky
and they're very industrial, sort of a post-punk. Yeah, you should look them up
online.
TRAILER REVIEW
INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS
THE WEINSTEIN COMPANY
Here's hoping World War II movie fatigue hasn't set in yet, because Quentin
Tarantino is about to get his gory hands on the genre. His take on Nazi-killing
is exactly what one would expect: lots of gunfire, goofy speeches and guys with
swastika tattoos on their foreheads. And Brad Pitt in a Clark Gable mustache
screaming for Nazi skulls. This movie is going to make John Wayne turn over in
his grave - and that's a good thing.

Short films, high hopes

Hard days for
print media

By ANDREW LAPIN and
EMILY BOUDREAU
Daily Film Writers
Every year around Oscar nomi-
nation time, there are at least 10
recognized films the general pub-
lic will have never heard of: the
five live-action and five animated
shorts nominated in the Acad-
emy's "Best Short Film" catego-
ries. But it doesn't have to be that
way anymore. The Michigan The-
ater is currently screening all the
2009 Oscar-nominated short films
in two separate programs or one
combined, discounted program.
The Daily picks apart the best and
worst from this cinematic smor-
gasbord.
ANIMATION:
"Oktapodi"
Short but sweet, this two-min-
ute French CGI lark follows an
octopus as he attempts to save his
significant other from the clutch-
es of a restaurateur. The film's
slightly insane pace makes it play
like a deleted scene from "Find-
ing Nemo." Superb art direction is
on display as the characters race
through a gorgeously designed
hilly seaside village.
COURTESY OF TALANiS i
"Pieces of Love" ("Le Maison
en Petits Cubes")
Every frame of this exquisite
Japanese film could be sold as a
watercolor painting. The concept
is engrossing, if melancholy: An
old man lives alone in a flooded
village, and he must constantly
add new floors onto his house to
survive above the rising tide. As he
scuba dives through his submerged
home, he recounts happy memories
of his family from years gone by. Of
the five nominees in this category,
"Pieces" is most deserving of the
prize.
"This Way Up"
Considering two hallmarks
of British comedy are slapstick
and making fun of dead people, it

should come as no surprise that
this short (concerning two bum-
bling morticians who must trans-
port a recently deceased woman
to her grave by foot) comes out of
the United Kingdom. "This Way
Up" is morbidly hilarious as the
heroes get caught in one ridicu-
lous obstacle after another - it's
like Tim Burton by way of Rube
Goldberg.

story of the same title by Andre
Dubus, tells the classic tale of the
new kid in class. But this time, the
"new boy" is a refugee from Africa
who is isolated from his country
and peers. The boy carries a heavy
secret in addition to the tradition-
al "new school" problems (bullies
and the annoying girl who decides
she has a crush on him). He flashes
back to memories of his home in
Africa, his school and his father
to create a piece that is both funny
and powerful.
"On the Line" ("Auf Der
Strecke")
Yes, Lance Bass of "NSYNC is in
a 2001 movie with the same title.
No worries, though: This German
film is much better. A department
store security guard is madly in
love with a girl who works in the
book department. He is so enchant-
ed by her that he watches her on his
surveillance cameras. He is a lone-
ly man - most of his interactions
with others are based on what he
observes through his camera. He
wants to find a connection with
somebody who is not barred by a
camera lens. After a preventable
tragedy strikes on the subway, he
finds the relationship he seeks but
is ridden with guilt.

her son's innocence by telling him
his Jewish best friend is taking a
trip to Toyland. The boy packs his
suitcase in the middle of the night,
determined to follow his friend
there. The plot seems like a repeat
of "Life is Beautiful" at first, but
the endinghas arather unexpected
twist. This German film has a rath-
er tired feel, though. Its plot, shots
of black and white photographs,
and theme of perpetual innocence
have all been worn out.

"Lavatory - Lovestory"
In this minimalist Russian short,
a lonely public bathroom attendant
finds mysterious bouquets in her
tip jar and tries to deduce her secret
admirer from the many gentlemen
occupying the toilets. (It seems tip
jars in bathrooms and restroom
caretakers of the opposite sex are
commonplace in Russia.) The film
is cute, but the black outlines of
characters on white backgrounds
tend to resemble a Red Bull com-
mercial.
"Presto"
The Pixar short-making
machine strikes again with this
zany magician-versus-rabbit tale
(which opened for last summer's
"WALL-E" in theaters). It's laugh
out loud funny, with more exces-
sively violent physical humor than
the studio has perhaps ever dared.
While "Presto" doesn't meet the
imaginative heights of "For the
Birds" or "Geri's Game," it works
wonders as an extended Tex Avery
homage.

"The Pig"
An old man has to suffer the
indignity of having gastrointesti-
nal surgery (or as he puts it, "sur-
gery in the butt") in this Danish
short film. The situation is light-
ened slightly when he notices the
rather odd picture of a pig on his
wall with a smile he describes as
"just like the Mona Lisa." The man
comes to believe the pig to be his
"guardian angel" and causes a fuss
when the painting goes missing.
The film is thoroughly enjoyable
and perhaps the most Oscar-wor-
thy of the bunch.
BONUS FILMS:
To give your buck added bang,
the Animated Shorts showcase
also includes five "extra com-
mended" (not nominated) films
from 2008. Four of these are ani-
mal tales. Two of them, "Gopher
Broke" and "Hot Dog" (both
from the United States) are goofy
slapstick; one, the U.K.'s "John
and Karen," is cheeky and dia-
logue-based; and one, the U.K.'s
"Varmints," is just bizarre (a
humanoid dog attempts to pro-
tect his meadow from the evils
of urban sprawl ... and giant jel-
lyfish). The remaining film,
France's "Skhizein," shows a man
who's struck by a meteor and
finds he's literally beside him-
self. It's the best offering of all
the shorts. Why this engrossing
and darkly humorous work didn't
receive an actual nomination is
mind-boggling.

D ear reader: I know you're
tired of column after col-
umn, in print or online,
about the death of print media. Or
how subscrib-
ers no longer
care about the
written word
or the printed
page, or liter-
ary criticism
takingup
space in news- KIMBERLY
papers readers CHOU
no longer want
or can afford to buy.
I'm tired of it, too. So let's just
get this over with: I hope you're
reading this on your 2nd-genera-
tion Kindle, several months in the
future. Because if the big-name
newspapers start going the way of
the big-name banks, the ways in
which the general reading public
receives books will change - more
than they already have. (My God.
I can't believe I just wrote about
journalistic and financial institu-
tions in the same sentence.)
Let me explain.
These days, cities that his-
torically have been known as two-
newspaper towns are in threat of
losing one or both of their major
papers. Once-mighty dailies are
cutting or severely limiting home
delivery (hello, Detroit News and
Detroit Free Press) and even the
bastions of old-media culture
are looking a little shaky these
days. In the most recent issue of
The Atlantic, Michael Hirschorn
wondered out loud - to the ire
of The Gray Lady's execs - what
would happen "if The New York
Times goes out of business, like,
this May?" Hirschorn suggests
that that the Times, revamped as
solely nytimes.com, could come to
dominate digital journalism, to the
point where it "resemble(s) a big-
ger, better and less partisan ver-
sion of The Huffington Post."
So, we can assume that the
Sunday Book Review will still
exist as a separate entity online.
We can also assume that readers
who faithfully read the Sunday
Book Review - who actually seek
it out instead of picking it up after
they've already read the other sec-
tions, flipped through the maga-
zine and skimmed through the
wedding announcements - will
still seek it out. But what about the
casual Sunday readers who pick
up the Book Review because it's
in between two sections they are
already going to read? What hap-
pens when there's a significantly
lower chance that a book section
will catch your eye, because it
doesn't actually exist in print any-
more?
The Washington Post's decision
to cease printing its weekly Book
World as a distinct section, divid-
ing the book content into two other
sections after Feb. 15, provoked
more tired sighs from the literary
community.
"There is a lot of great online
coverage, but you go and look for
it," said novelist Meg Wolitzer, a
regular reviewer for Book World,
on the nytimes.com ArtsBeat blog.

"For people who get it on their
front step, books are honored there
and the loss of that seems like a big
mistake."
By affording this monolithic
category of"books" (reviews, pre-
views, author interviews) its own
separate section instead of tacking
it onto the end of another section,
as the Los Angeles Times has done
since cutting its Sunday stand-
alone in 2007, newspapers are, to
borrow ArtsBeat's words, "sym-
bolically prioritizing" literary pro-
duction and culture. But they're
also makingbetter-rounded people
of their readers - or encouraging
that thought, at least.
A guest speaker once said dur-
ing a lunch not geared toward
newspapers about the importance
of architecture in print media:
how where you place stories on
the page, where in the section
and in what section, is goingto
affect the chances the stories are
going to be read. It's very much
common sense, right? Technol-
Difficult times
call for digital
publishing.
ogy is changing the influence
newspapers can have on readers.
When you're reading a newspaper
online, it's much easier to bypass
stories or whole sections you're
not that interested in; with news
aggregators like Google Reader,
readers can further tailor their
media intake so that they really
don't encounter much outside their
interests at all.
If newspapers continue to cut
sections to cut costs, or cease
printing altogether, readers who
want their dose of literary culture
with the Sunday paper will have
to do some more searching online.
Readers who were absorbingthe
occasional extra book review
because of its proximity to other
content of interest might not be
quite as inspired as before to seek
out other book-related reading.
Certainly the idea of "literary criti-
cism" has certain connotations -
"pretentious" comes to mind. But
wrapped into the everyman insti-
tution of a newspaper, the "book
review" appears accessible to most
everyone. But that accessibility
might not save them.
Of course, there are other
reasons why books may be los-
ing their place on the newspaper
page. With the slumping pub-
lishing industry acquiring fewer
new books, and some companies
issuing such alarming notices as
Houghton Mifflin Harcourt's in
November (when it announced it
would stop acquisitions until fur-
ther notice), at some point there
may simply be fewer books to
write about.
Chou is unable to use the Internet.
E-mail her at kimberch@urich.edu
and hopefully she'll be able to open it.

"Manon on the Asphalt"
This French film is not nearly
as dismal as it sounds. Manon is
involved in an accident and, as she
is dying, she experiences flashes
of past evenings with friends and
old boyfriends. She wonders how
each of these people will handle
her death, and she ponders the
times they'll have after she's
gone. The jazzy soundtrack and
the bright summer light create a
dreamlike atmosphere that some-
how manages to reassure the con-
tinuation of life even after Manon
is gone.

the arts is handled mostly on
the state level and through
several separate federal insti-

years, from $175 to $125 mil-
lion annually. But more prob-
lematic is the lack of cohesive
goals among such public cul-
tural institutions as the NEA,
National Public Radio and Pub-
lic Broadcasting Service.
Most nations solve this con-
fusion by establishing an arts-
and-culture cabinet position to

offer the overarching guidance
these organizations need to
make substantial changes. Such
a position provides the author-
ity and resources required to

During the Great Depression, Franklin
Delano Roosevelt funded (through the Farm
Security Administration) photo documen-
tation of America's strife and strength. The
great works generated through this program
are still heralded today as triumphs in Ameri-
can art. Struggling through the Civil Rights
Politics and politicians
have a great effect
on how the arts
are cultivated.
Movement, Lyndon B. Johnson created the
NEA and the National Endowment for the
Humanities. Obama could continue this
national tradition of overcoming daunting
times, not only in tax plans, defense strategy
and diplomacy - all imperative components
- but also by invigorating the American spirit
through a strengthening of our common bond:
our culture.

It's also worth noting that, historically,
some of our most celebrated artistic works
emerged from times of strife. "Gone with the
Wind" and "The Wizard of Oz," two of Hol-
lywood's highest rated masterpieces, were
released in 1939, a trying time for an America
suffering through the end of the Great Depres-
sion and possibly on the verge of war.
Many argue that, in these troubled econom-
ic times, the arts should be the least of our wor-
ries. But it should be duly noted that cultural
products are some of America's most valuable
exports. American movies, music, books and
art (as well as our actors, actresses and musi-
cians) have become cultural commodities and
are extremely marketable abroad.
Creating a position in the presidential cabi-
net for arts and culture would allow public
cultural institutions to work together more
easily and efficiently. More scholarships could
be awarded to budding artists. More theaters
and performance spaces could be built, and
more community orchestras, choirs and the-
ater companies could be funded.
America is often known as the world's cul-
tural center. We have the potential to culti-
vate a great arts culture, but we're missing
the boat. With a little guidance and a decent
effort, the benefits to be reaped could be just
what we need.

T THE JESUS AND MARY CHAIN 'HONEY'S DEAD' (1992)
Irreverently essential

By DAVID WATNICK
ManagingArts Editor
"I wanna die just like Jesus
Christ."
That's how The Jesus and Mary
Chain jumpedinto their 1992 album,
Honey'sDead.Andifoffendedlisten-
ers hadn't turned the disc off by the
time irreverent opener "Reverence"
got around to "I wanna die just like
JFK," they probably should have
because the content of the lecher-
ous, "Lolita"-esque second track,
"Teenage Lust," is hardly gentler.
Atfirstglance,Honey'sDeadlooks
like a gratuitous attempt to ruffle
everyone's feathers. Its title sug-
gests an unceremonious disavowal
of the principles thatmade the Mary
Chain's groundbreaking 1985 debut
Psychocandy and its legendary cut
"Just like Honey" so enduring. And
the first two tracks of Honey's reek
of unapologetic violence and pedo-
philia. But in reality, the album is
more physical than violent, more
sexual than pedophilic and more
resembling of Psychocandy than its
immediate predecessor, the 1989
new-wave machine gun Automatic.
After spending the previous
five years relying on only a drum
machine to hold time, the Reid
brothers enlisted a living, breath-
ing person - Curve's Steve Monti
- to keep rhythm on the record.
As a result, the Mary Chain turned
into something of a traditional (in a
very liberal sense of the word) rock
band.
The newer rock approach smacks
out of nowhere with the third track,

Connecting writers and readers

Reading Series. These readings
allow members of the University
to showcase their writing to their
peers and Ann Arbor citizens. For
many writers, this is one of their
first opportunities to read in front
of a large audience.
"It forces you to feel like some-
thing's complete. It stops feeling
like it's something in progress,"
MFA student Elizabeth Gramm
said, describing the feeling of read-
ing her poetry aloud. "It's some-
thing more separate. It's so freeing
to just appreciate it by listening.
Getting to hear our peers just read,
it's a gift and we can just enjoy it
rather than thinking about tweak-
ing it or changing it."
Gramm explained that the MFA
program is a cohesive group. Brian
Short, MFA student and Gramm's
counterpart, explained the rush of
a reading as an audience member,
comparing it to seeing a theater
performance.
"There's something about see-
ing it happen. This amazing energy
that will never happen in the same
way," Short said.
