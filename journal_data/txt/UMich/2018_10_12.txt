Following the defeat of a 
citizen task force’s proposal for 
a police oversight commision at 
a City Council meeting on Oct. 1, 
legal questions remain regarding 
aspects of the citizens’ draft and 
changes in Ann Arbor Mayor 
Christopher 
Taylor’s 
counter-
proposal.
The citizen task force drafted 
a proposal that would create 
a citizen-led police oversight 
commission with the power to 
subpoena records and officer 
testimony, as well as the ability to 
examine “any AAPD (Ann Arbor 
Police Department) information 
and records,” according to the 
ordinance.
Calls for police oversight gained 
momentum following the 2014 
death of Aura Rosser, a mother 
of three who was fatally shot by 
Ann Arbor police officer David 
Ried. City Council appointed 
the task force in January to 
offer recommendations for the 
formation of an independent 
commission to review the practices 
of AAPD. The task force submitted

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Over the last couple of years, 
many standardized tests have 
moved over to a digital formatting 
system. Now, the last of the 
graduate school admissions tests 

— the Law School Admission Test 
— joins them in this technological 
advancement.
The Law School Admissions 
Council declared the LSAT will 
be a tablet-based administration 
starting in July 2019. Instead of a 
test booklet, students will receive 

a Samsung tablet, a stylus and a 
white pencil with a scrap sheet 
of paper.
The stylus will not mimic 
handwriting; instead, it will 
feature testing tools including 
highlighting and underlining. 
There will also be a multitude 

of annotation tools such as 
numbering passages. A proctor 
will still be present in the room, 
but all timing will be done 
electronically on the tablet itself.
In addition, there are an array 
of accessibility options built into 

Students have mixed feelings about 
LSAT’s impending switch to digital
As students gear up for the new format, test prep professionals urge them not to worry

As Election Day approaches 
in Ann Arbor, development of 
the Library Lot on Fifth Avenue 
across from the Ann Arbor 
District Library remains up for 
debate.
Many City Councilmembers 
are in favor of allowing Chicago-
based real estate firm Core Spaces 
to develop a 17-story high-rise 
called the Collective on Fifth 
Avenue, while residents have 
expressed desires for an urban 
park and commons area. The 
Collective would host 200 to 500 
units, 43 workforce housing units, 
and hotel and office space. 
City Council sold the property 
to Core Spaces in 2017.
Citizens will be asked if a 
section should be added to the 
city charter stating the Library 
Lot 
must 
remain 
in 
public 
ownership and developed as 
a “Center of the City” lot. The

LGBTQ Monologues hosts intersectional 
dialogue on National Coming Out Day

DANYEL THARAKAN/Daily
Brittney Williams speaks on her experience coming out as bisexual at the LGBTQ Monologues held on National Coming Out Day in Weill Hall Thursday.

Speakers discuss identity, difficulties of being an LGBTQ student on campus at event’s second year

Oct. 11 was National Coming 
Out Day, but it was also the 5-year 
anniversary of Brittney Williams’s 
mother’s death. As a speaker for 
Out in Public’s Second Annual 
LGBTQ Monologues, Williams, a 
University of Michigan School of 
Social Work alum, shared her story 

of how she did not come out to her 
mother before she passed. Williams 
concluded her monologue on a 
hopeful note — that her mother 
would have accepted her.
Coinciding 
with 
National 
Coming Out Day, the monologues 
were held at the Ford School 
of 
Public 
Policy 
featuring 
student speakers with about 150 
attendees. The theme of this year’s 
monologues was “More Pride. 

More Color,” and the event aimed 
to create a space for intersecting 
identities to be represented and 
heard equally.
The student presenters shared 
stories and experiences in the 
form of story-telling, poetry and 
more. Students spoke of identities, 
coming out and navigating families 
and college.
“When I realized that the 
monologues fell on this day, this 

year, I was torn because I didn’t 
know if I wanted to talk or not,” 
Williams said. “But I felt like it was 
important because I’ve spoken a 
lot about my relationship with my 
mother in every single way, except 
for related to my queerness.”
Rackham student Alex Kime 
presented their story through the 
form of a poem titled “The Ongoing 
Draft of an Ars Poetica.” Kime’s 
poem covered experiences from 

their childhood to now, including 
their time with theater and poetry 
writing.
“I began to try and dim my 
shine, cried again and again at the 
name Alexander,” Kime said. “Did 
an impression at a cast party, and 
suddenly I was Edna, it was time to 
be flamboyant and loud.”

The seats of Regents Andrew 
Richner (R) and Andrea Newman 
(R) on the University of Michigan 
Board of Regents are up for reelec-
tion this November. With Jordan 
Acker (D) and Paul Brown (D) chal-
lenging the incumbent candidates 
for a position on the Board, citizens 
across the state will get the opportu-
nity to cast their ballots for who they 
think should serve on the Univer-
sity’s governing board for another 
eight years, as outlined in the Michi-
gan Constitution. This process of 
electing governing boards applies 
to Michigan State University and 
Wayne State University as well.
Many other states appoint the 
governing boards of their public 

Universities and officials have long 
debated with process is best — elec-
tion or appointment. 
Michael 
Traugott, 
professor 
emeritus of communication studies 
and political science, explained how 
the system functions.
“In the past, a larger proportion 
of its the University’s budget came 
from tax money appropriated by 
the state legislature,” Traugott said. 
“But it’s the money of taxpayers in 
the state of Michigan that supports 
the University, so it doesn’t seem 
unreasonable to me that the quali-
fied residents of the state should be 
able to vote for (the Regents).”
Regent Katherine White (D) 
emphasized the historic aspect of 
the election process for the regents, 
noting the system is more resistant 
to political change.
“Over the intervening 164 years, 

this system of governance has held 
the University of Michigan free 
from untoward political interfer-
ence, and has guided the University 
to its standing among the world’s 
leading institutions of higher edu-
cation,” White wrote in an email 
interview.
White also said the statewide 
election of regents allows more 
voices to be heard.
“Because registered voters in the 
State of Michigan elect Regents, 
every two years voters have an op-
portunity to have their voices heard 
at the ballot box directly,” White 
wrote. “Direct election of the Board 
of Regents to all Michigan voters al-
lows for a lot of participation.”
Former Regent Philip Power, 
who wrote an article following 
MSU’s conflicts with its governing 
board earlier this year, said there 
are two general arguments for 
and against the system. Power 
said one of the benefits is the di-
rect connection of the citizens to 
the University. On the other hand, 
voters are much less informed.
“The argument against is that 
candidates for these governing 
boards are found way down the 
ballot,” Power said. “And worse, 
most people who vote at these 
elections have no idea who these 
candidates are, what their qualifi-
cations are or where they stand on 
the issues.”
Traugott explained the term 
“roll-off” that specifically applies 
to the concept of voters being less 
likely to vote farther down the 
ballot.
“There is a phenomenon called 
roll-off across the ballot where 
the farther down you go people 
don’t vote for these offices,” Trau-
gott said.
Power added in his experience 
campaigning, there was a vast 
population that he couldn’t reach.
“When I was running, there 
were nine million people in the 
state, now how does one candi-
date for a not very well-known 
office way down on the voting bal-

lot manage to talk to nine and half 
million?” Power said. “The short 
answer is you don’t.”
White said that most voters 
would have some relation to the 
University because of its influence 
as an employer and institution.
“The University of Michigan is 
one of the top-five employers in the 
State of Michigan, has an outstand-
ing Health System ranked in the 
top five nationally, and has about 
63,000 students across the three 
campuses,” White wrote. “Thus, all 
people in the State of Michigan have 
a stake in and have a relationship to 
University of Michigan.”
LSA sophomore Michael Briggs 
has been encouraging other stu-
dents to register to vote. Briggs 
co-produced a non-partisan video 
series with the Washtenaw County 
government with steps on register-
ing. Last gubernatorial election in 
2014, 17.4 percent of the voting age 
population turned out to vote, a de-
crease from 21.9 percent in 2010.
Briggs said he emphasizes being 
an informed voter to the students 
he reaches out to, giving them re-
sources and ways to become more 
informed.
“I always refer students to michi-
gan.gov/vote and remind them to 
research every candidate and issue 
on their ballot,” Briggs wrote in an 
email interview. “I’m often asked 
by students about specific offices, 
such as regents. When this happens, 
I give the information I have and 
encourage students to do research 
independently about all the candi-
dates.”
This election system, many re-
gent campaigns are addressing is-
sues that would impact students 
and recent grauduates such as in-
creasing tuition rates, accessibility, 
health care, economic impacts of 
University projects and more.
Traugott said lack of information 
is one of the contributing factors to 
roll-off.

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
You should know that one neighbor spent nine months 
constantly, and I mean daily, dealing with city, University police and 
Greek life entities before one of these party houses set up by members of 
a banned fraternity was shut down. This is a real problem. Others in this 
neighborhood must constantly deal with trash, public drunkenness, loud 
music and other violations of city ordinances. Oversight of these groups 
is not done at the national level despite the claims of their attorneys. 
Oversight by the University and the Office of Greek Life does not seem 
to make much difference.”

Peter Nagourney, the co-chair for the North Burns Park Association and neighbor to several Greek life houses

Every Friday, one Daily news staffer will give a behind the scenes 
look at one of this week’s stories. This week, LSA junior Julia Ford 
looked into how voter registration initiatives are switching gears 
now that voter registration day has passed.

“I’m from Pennsylvania so I didn’t really think about what it’s like to 
vote in Michigan and I assumed that it was very similar and one of the 
things we can do in Pennsylvania and many a lot of different states 
is just use an absentee ballot whenever you need so I’m doing that 
but in Michigan, you can’t vote for the first time with an absentee 
ballot which I found very interesting. It makes more sense as to why 
more voter registration initiatives are necessary in order for students 
to be able to vote and to know what they need to do to get to the 
polls … I think it’s important that people do go to the ballots knowing 
who they’re voting for and why they want to vote for them. I think 
it’s important that organizations on campus care about providing 
information that’s unbiased and I think we do have some great 
organizations doing that so students of any political affiliation can vote 
for who they believe in based on facts and good information.”

Goldenberg, professor of public 
policy and political science, 
founded Turn Up Turnout, a 
non-partisan 
student 
group 
which aims to increase voter 
registration and turnout among 
young people. Upon discovering 
the NSLVE data, Goldenberg 
said she felt motivated to 
develop a voting initiative.
“We’re surprised both at 
how low everybody is, and 
we’re surprised Michigan isn’t 
leading rather than trailing,” 
Goldenberg 
said. 
“So 
we 
thought this really wasn’t the 
Michigan that we know and are 
proud of, and we really wanted 
to do something about that.”
Goldenberg recruited some 
of her former students to form 
TUT, and they soon pitched 
the Big Ten Voting Challenge 
to University President Mark 
Schlissel. The Big Ten Voting 
Challenge, a competition among 
all the Big Ten universities to 
see which school can produce 
the highest percentage and 
greatest improvement in voter 
turnout in the Nov. 6 election, 
began 
in 
September 
2017. 
Among the hurdles to student 
voting, registration was one of 
the first to be addressed.
“One big reason is that 

students move a lot and their 
voter 
registration 
doesn’t 
stay 
current, 
and 
they 
sometimes forget to update 
their addresses,” Goldenberg 
said. “Another reason is all the 
voting rules we have to abide 
by are state rules, and they 
vary by state, and some states 
have passed rules that make it 
much easier for young people 
to vote than other states. For 
example, quite a few states now 
have online registration, but 
Michigan doesn’t.”
The state of Michigan also 
does not offer early voting, 
which can alleviate scheduling 
difficulties for students trying 
to make time to travel to the 
polls. Erin Byrnes, democratic 
engagement 
lead 
at 
the 
Ginsberg Center, said the early 
voter registration deadline can 
also pose challenges to student 
turnout.
“We 
do 
have 
a 
voter 
registration 
deadline 
in 
Michigan that’s 30 days out, 
so the time is limited,” Byrnes 
said. “Once you’re back on 
campus, if you’re looking to 
register in Michigan, you’ve got 
roughly five weeks to make that 
happen.”
In order to increase student 
voter registration, TUT and 
the Big Ten Voting Challenge, 
as well as several other student 
groups, 
advertised 
voter 

registration information online 
and offered voter registration 
tables on campus. Now that the 
Michigan 
voter 
registration 
date has passed, the Big Ten 
Voting Challenge will focus 
on educating students about 
their choices on the ballot and 
voting logistics. Though the 
voter 
registration 
deadline 
in 
Michigan 
closed, 
voter 
registration for many out-of-
state students is still open.
“Pushing people to get out 
and vote, making sure people 
know when election day is 
and when the polls are open, 
making sure folks know they 
can bring their U of M ID with 
them, that’s a valid form of ID, 
all of those things are really 
important,” Byrnes said. “Polls 
are open until 8 p.m., if you’re 
in line at 8, you can vote and 
they can’t tell you to leave.”
Byrnes said organizers will 
now focus on providing students 
with information on decisions 
they will have to make at the 
polls, 
including 
a 
proposal 
that would dramatically alter 
Michigan’s voter registration 
deadline.
“We’ll still doing in person, 
peer-to-peer tabling,” Byrnes 
said. 

A, was put on the ballot after a 
citizen-led petition gathered more 
than 5,000 signatures to place it 
on the November ballot.
Ann Arbor Mayor Christopher 
Taylor 
urged 
residents 
in 
a 
letter posted to Twitter on Sunday 
to vote “no” because of a loss of tax 
revenue and affordable housing.
“If City Proposal A passes, we 
will lose hundreds of units of new, 
permanent affordable housing; 
miss out on millions of dollars of 
tax revenue to support basic city 
services; and be forced to either 
raise taxes or re-allocate millions 
of parks dollars to build and 
operate a failed park in the middle 
of our downtown,” Taylor wrote. 
“The passage of City Proposal A 
will sentence the Library Lot to 
remain what it is today: desolate 
and uninviting.”
Councilmember 
Anne 
Bannister, D-Ward 1, said she 
believes the city has enough 
tax 
revenue 
without 
new 
developments and thinks Taylor is 
stressing the issue tax revenue loss 
to fit his agenda.
“The city does have a lot of 
tax revenue,” Bannister said. “It 
seems a bit disingenuous that 
when it’s something that the 
mayor supports, he asks for money 
for it. But, when it’s something he 
doesn’t support, he brings up this 
idea that we don’t have the money. 
These things are invaluable to 
the economic vitality and it’s 
an economic engine to have an 
upbeat, positive, inviting ‘Center 
of the City.’”
Taylor criticized the proposal 
for a lacking a payment plan for 
the development of the urban park 
and commons.
“It proposes to obligate the 
city without any kind of proposal 
on how to pay for it to reserve 
the land for an urban park and 
commons,” Taylor said. “A park 
at that location will be a failure 
… Urban parks in order to be 
successful have to have organic 
activity.”
Bannister is one of three 
councilmembers viewed as an 
opposition member of Taylor’s 
eight-councilmember 
majority 
and urges voters to say “yes,” to 
Proposal A.
“We’re 
representatives 
of 
democracy,” Bannister said. “As I 
hike around the ward and the city 
and also for my own campaign 
… I’m continuing to amplify the 
voices of the residents as best I 
can and am firmly supporting 
this urban park and ‘Center of the 
City’.”
According to Taylor, passage 
of Proposal A would also cost 
money the city can use to pay 
off the repurchase of the “Y lot.” 
On May 1, the council voted to 
repurchase the property at 350 S. 
Fifth Ave. for $4.2 million from 
real 
estate 
developer 
Dennis 
Dahlmann. The repurchase came 
after Dahlmann failed to develop 
the property into commercial 
developments 
and 
affordable 
housing.

Taylor also explained the 43 
units that would be developed 
at 150 percent of fair market 
rent were designed to be workforce 
housing units instead of affordable 
housing units.
“150 percent of fair market rent 
is going to be below market rent 
because fair market rent is a figure 
derived by HUD (Department of 
Housing and Urban Development) 
in order to key a number of 
things, one of which is Section 
8 vouchers,” Taylor said. “These 
are going to be apartments in a 
location where rents can be quite 
high, there’s going to be 43 units 
available in this building for 
people that otherwise couldn’t 
afford it.”
In an open letter addressed to 
Taylor, Ann Arbor resident Mary 
Hathaway 
criticized 
Taylor’s 
critique 
of 
losing 
affordable 
housing 
by 
addressing 
the 
financing of the project.
“We all want more, truly 
affordable housing,” Hathaway 
wrote in her letter. “You and 
others on Council set a goal of 
creating over 3,000 new units of 
affordable housing by 2035. The 
question is, what’s the best way to 
achieve that goal? Your answer is 
to sell public land to Core Spaces, 
a Chicago developer specializing 
in luxury student apartments, and 
allocate $5 million to the housing 
trust fund. Does $5 million really 
buy 200 to 500 new units of 
affordable housing? ... Most people 
have no idea how you will leverage 
$5 million to create 500 units. Do 
you?” 
Hathaway said the council 
should look at the Library Lot as an 
opportunity to build relationships 
and neighborhoods.
“By retaining public land at the 
center of the city, we can take a 
more holistic approach to planning 
for development on the Library 
Block,” Hathaway wrote. “Rather 
than looking at a parcel in isolation 
and 
insisting 
on 
maximum 
development of a 17-story tower 
(or one even taller than that), we 
should look for an integrative 
approach 
that 
strengthens 
the relationships between the 
neighboring 
structures 
and 
welcomes pedestrian movement.”
Taylor also mentioned the 
contract requires Core Spaces to 
have a 12,000-square foot public 
plaza that could be used for events.
Taylor 
believes 
passing 
Proposal A will raise similar issues 
associated with Liberty Plaza such 
as drug use and violence.
“Liberty Plaza does not meet 
our aspirations and if Proposal A 
passes, I’m very much concerned 
that a park at that location would 
replicate the failures of Liberty 
Plaza,” Taylor said.
Bannister 
and 
fellow 
Councilmember 
Sumi 
Kaliasapathy, 
D-Ward 
1, sued Taylor and City Clerk 
Jackie Beaudry in June over the 
development contract for allegedly 
signing a contract without the 
council’s approval.
Both Taylor and Bannister 
declined to comment on the 
status of the lawsuit because it is 
currently in litigation.

their proposed ordinance for 
consideration 
during 
a 
work 
session in September.
Three 
councilmembers 
introduced the citizen task force’s 
ordinance. Councilmember Sumi 
Kailasapathy, D-Ward 1, one of 
the sponsors of the ordinance, 
said it was the most democratic 
ordinance she had seen in her six 
years on the council, though she 
did say she didn’t feel the proposal 
was perfect.
The proposal was defeated 
by the council in a 5-4 vote. The 
council voted to advance Taylor’s 
competing ordinance in an 8-1 
vote, with only Kailasapathy 
voting against it, saying it was a 
“watered down” version of the 
citizen task force’s version.
“Somebody 
feels 
like 
something is better than nothing, 
but sometimes that something 
actually 
undermines 
the 
credibility and the trust that the 
community needs to have in this 
commission,” Kailasapathy said. 
“That’s my rationale.”
Since the vote, Taylor said his 
ordinance retained most of the 
important aspects of the citizen’s 
proposal while ensuring that it 
adhered to the city charter and 
AAPD’s 
collective 
bargaining 
agreements.
“It is very important to me 
that we have an effective, trusted 
and 
legally 
defensible 
police 
commission,” Taylor said. “We 
received the task force’s proposed 
ordinance. What I did is I went 
through that ordinance with the 
city attorney’s office and strove 
to take as many of the policy 
recommendations as would meet 
that standard and strove to put 
them into law.”
The defeats of the citizen’s 
proposal angered the task force’s 
supporters, who began chanting, 

“Who do you protect? Who do 
you serve?” as councilmembers 
walked out of the meeting.
In 
response 
to 
the 
legal 
questions concerning the police 
oversight 
commission 
at 
the 
meeting, task force co-chair Rich 
Friedman challenged the council 
to have more patience before 
discarding the citizens’ proposal.
“With some of the parts where 
people are very dissatisfied, I 
think we just have to say, ‘Well, 
let’s see how it works,’” Friedman 
said. “Let’s see if the city does 
what it says it’s going to do. Let’s 
see if the police department does 
what it says it’s going to do.”
In 
both 
ordinances, 
the 
commission 
would 
have 
11 
voting 
members, 
including 
a youth member, with two 
councilmembers acting as non-
voting liaisons. Members would 
be appointed by the City Council 
liaisons and approved by City 
Council. 
Active 
duty 
police 
officers 
and 
city 
employees 
are ineligible to sit on the 
commission, with the task force’s 
ordinance extending the ban to 
include any former employees of 
or “regular contractors” with the 
city or “any police department.”
The commission in each case 
would be able to initiate its 
own review of AAPD practices 
and conduct, as well as retain 
independent 
counsel 
subject 
to approval by City Council. 
Additionally, 
people 
filing 
complaints could choose to 
remain anonymous.
However, in the task force’s 
ordinance, 
the 
commission 
could withhold complaints from 
AAPD, which could potentially 
conflict with the department’s 
union contract.
Nancy Niemela, who works 
at the City Attorney’s Office, 
said the police department’s 
collective bargaining agreement 
requires that employees are 
notified of complaints against 
them within two weeks of when 

the city receives the complaint.
“It provides certain timelines 
for that investigation, it provides 
certain disciplines that can be 
imposed on the officers and 
then it goes on and provides 
the 
grievance 
process 
after 
that, with respect to how the 
grievance proceeds and then 
goes to arbitration,” Niemela 
said.
Taylor’s ordinance avoids this 
issue by giving residents the 
option to “transmit information” 
to 
the 
commission 
through 
community liaisons instead of 
filing a direct complaint.
The 
mayor’s 
proposed 
ordinance and the ordinance 
created 
by 
the 
citizen 
task 
force 
both 
explicitly 
state 
the 
police 
oversight 
commission 
is 
expected 
to 
operate independently of City 
Council and other arms of city 
government. However, a memo 
from City Attorney Stephen 
Postema cast doubt on just how 
much autonomy the council 
could award the police oversight 
commission.
Postema 
argued 
any 
commission 
created 
by 
the 
council “is part of the City” from 
a legal perspective, meaning the 
commission would not be an 
independent legal entity.
“Any ‘independence’ by the 
Commission would be, as with 
any board or commission, limited 
to operating the commission 
within the parameters of any 
resolution or ordinance setting up 
the Commission,” Postema wrote.
As a result, the police oversight 
commission would be subject 
to the same legal constraints as 
the rest of city government. That 
includes the city charter, existing 
laws and collective bargaining 
agreements 
with 
AAPD 
employees.
According to Postema, the 
subpoena power given to the 
commission by the task force’s 
proposal is problematic because 

the city charter does not explicitly 
give the council this power.
“Because the City Council may 
not have this power, it would not 
have the authority to delegate 
such power to a Commission,” 
Postema wrote.
Taylor’s ordinance does not 
include subpoena power. It also 
differs from the task force’s 
ordinance in that it states that 
an investigation undertaken by 
the commission must begin after 
AAPD completes an internal 
investigation.
Kailasapathy took issue with 
the prohibition on concurrent 
investigations during discussions 
at the City Council meeting, and 
supported allowing simultaneous 
inquiries.
“I don’t think it’s the intention 
of the commission to be getting in 
the way,” Kailasapathy said. “It’s 
almost two parallel tracks.”
Niemela said there was nothing 
barring concurrent investigations 
in the AAPD collective bargaining 
agreements because “it’s never 
been an issue before.”
Despite the criticisms of the 
task force supporters, Taylor said 
he was hopeful his ordinance 
would be able to foster trust in 
the community between residents 
and law enforcement. The council 
will take up the issue of funding 
for the police commission in 
Taylor’s ordinance at the City 
Council meeting on Monday.
“I believe that we all share 
the same goal,” Taylor said. “I 
believe that we all want a policing 
commission 
that 
provides 
meaningful 
commissioner 
oversight of the police department, 
and that the commission that 
will result from the ordinance 
up for consideration on Monday 
will have that result. I believe 
that we all share the same goal 
of making sure that Ann Arbor 
police and the citizens that they 
serve have a common trust and 
understanding.”

the digital system. Students will 
be able to brighten the screen, 
make the text bigger and utilize a 
variety of other resources.
LSA 
sophomore 
Jack 
Wroldsen, who is considering Law 
School, believes these changes 
were inevitable and may require a 
bit more practice, but overall will 
be a great aid to students.
“I really like (the switch to 
digital) — I think the LSAC is 
moving in the right direction by 
putting it online and increasing 
the testing availability,” Wroldsen 
said. “Advanced degree tests 
like the GMAT have been online 
for decades, so I think moving 
into a digital format is the LSAC 
keeping up with the times. It may 
take a bit more practicing and it 
adds some sort of unpredictability 
as it’s hard to know exactly what 
it’ll look like. But I’m sure it’ll be 
a well-structured program that 

makes the testing process actually 
easier.”
Jeff 
Thomas, 
executive 
director of pre-law programs 
for Kaplan Test Prep, believes 
this is a practical change, saying 
newer generations of students 
will virtually age with the 
advancement of technology.
“This really gives two big 
advantages for the Law School 
Admission 
Council,” 
Thomas 
said. “First, it allows for a very 
consistent test-taking experience 
for students. Up until now, the 
test 
was 
paper-and-pencil-
based. 
Students 
would 
walk 
into the testing room and would 
encounter some sort of variability 
within the testing experience, 
such as proctors keeping time 
in different ways. Now there is 
a sense of consistency. Second, 
this will really allow the LSAC to 
speed up the scoring process and 
then get the scores in students’ 
hands faster.”
When the test transitions in 
July, about half of the students 

will take the computerized LSAT 
and the other half will take the 
standard pencil-and-paper test. 
Students won’t get to choose 
their type of test — it will be 
randomly assigned. Because of 
this, the LSAT is offering a one-
time opportunity: Students will 
have the chance to see their score 
before they decide whether they 
want to send it to each of their 
prospective schools. Those who 
decide to cancel are allowed the 
option to retake the test until 
April 2020 with no additional 
costs. The upcoming July test is 
the only test for which this will be 
an option.
Law student Jeff Nwagbo is 
in favor of the transition, but he 
believes students might just have 
to adjust their study habits.
“I don’t think it’s a huge deal 
either way,” Nwagbo said. “I 
think I’d rather take it on paper 
but that’s probably because of 
the way I studied for it. Some 
of my strategies for taking the 
test involved diagramming logic 

games or marking up the reading 
comprehension passages so I’m 
not sure how they’re going to 
handle that if the test is digital. 
I don’t think the online thing 
makes much of a difference in 
terms of difficulty.”
There are four paper-and-
pencil administrations of the 
LSAT left: November, January, 
March and June. Kaplan is 
encouraging all students that 
are considering studying for, 
preparing and taking the LSAT 
next year to take at least one of 
those 
final 
paper-and-pencil 
exams.
“Students shouldn’t be scared 
of the digital format, but it does 
introduce a level of complexity 
and 
unfamiliarity 
and 
there 
are, frankly, not going to be a 
tremendous amount of practice 
tools 
digitally 
available 
for 
students immediately at launch,”

As an editorial staff, we 
agree 
with 
the 
University 
that it is wrong for a student’s 
educational opportunities to be 
limited by the political stances 
of an instructor, rather than 
the merit of the student. The 
academic success of students 
should be a top priority for 
universities, and the denial 
of students’ recommendation 
letters 
on 
account 
of 
professors’ personal beliefs 
unfairly blocks students from 
academic opportunities based 
on 
circumstances 
outside 
their control. The decision to 
write a recommendation letter 
or not should be based on 
the student’s academic merit 
and 
performance 
in 
class, 
independent of the educator’s 
personal leanings.
However, on a campus that 
welcomes free speech and 
free thinking, the delineation 
between 
when 
certain 
personal and political views 
can and cannot be expressed 
on part of the professor is 
a 
blurry 
line. 
Professors 
have the freedom to craft 
their courses, design syllabi 
and 
work 
on 
independent 
projects, research and other 
scholarly work. The crossover 
of this ideal of professors’ 
free 
speech, 
so 
embedded 
in the University, with their 
relationships 
with 
classes 
and students is often a point 
of contention. Where do they 
draw the line in expressing 
their 
views? 
The 
reaction 
of the University this week 
provided a stark answer. The 
harsh disciplinary measures 
taken 
against 
Cheney-
Lippold’s 
statement 
which 
was, at its core, an expression 
of free speech, gave some 
clarity to this ever-blurred 
line. 
Yet, 
what 
remains 
an 
issue 
is 
whether 
the 
punishment was warranted 
given the lack of precedent. 
We believe it was not. Though 
Cole alluded to the Senate 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 
University Affairs’s statement 
condemning professors using 
political 
views 
to 
impede 
“free pursuit of learning in 

their students,” the University 
has yet to adopt a concrete 
policy regarding this matter. 
The absence of precedent on 
campus regarding the manner 
in which professors should 
or should not voice their 
perspectives 
and 
political 
leanings — a decision often 
left up to the discretion of 
the professor themselves — 
warranted a less severe mode 
of 
discipline 
on 
Cheney-
Lippold.
The University should have 
first expressed disagreement 
with 
the 
exclusionary 
behavior 
Cheney-Lippold 
presented towards a student 
in an academic setting and 
followed 
with 
a 
public, 
apolitical 
warning. 
This 
would 
help 
express 
the 
University’s main philosophy, 
which is to ensure academic 
opportunities, 
growth 
and 
support 
for 
students. 
Additionally, this would set 
a cautionary precedent for 
future University instructors 
who might consider doing the 
same in the future. This form 
of foreshadowing disciplinary 
action 
is 
more 
fair 
and 
effective than the immediate, 
reactionary discipline shown 
by the University.
Further, 
whether 
intentional 
or 
not, 
the 
swiftness 
and 
outspoken 
nature of the University’s 
action in this situation has 
the power to isolate some 
students on campus, namely 
Palestinian 
students 
and 
allies who have not seen the 
University as proactive in 
protecting 
their 
academic 
freedom 
and 
safety 
when 
they have been systematically 
targeted 
and 
harassed 
online for their own speech 
on the topic. Neutrality of 
the University is of utmost 
importance, as every student 
should feel equally supported 
by the University regardless 
of their religious or political 
beliefs. 
We 
would 
hope 
the 
outspokenness 
of 
the 
University on behalf of the 
two students in protecting 
their academic freedom is a 

sentiment that will be echoed 
for all students.
The 
institution 
of 
a 
university, at its core, is to be 
a place of development and 
thought — an environment 
conducive to growing academic 
interests, as well as personal 
values and perspectives. Free 
speech, then, is parallel to free 
thinking. If we as students are 
urged to, from day one, think 
for ourselves and be challenged 
by the theories, problems and 
readings we encounter daily, 
in an effort for us to leave 
this campus more confident in 
ourselves and beliefs, how can 
this expectation not extend to 
our professors? We recognize, 
however, that at the same 
time the students’ academic 
freedom 
was 
also 
limited 
by the refusal of both the 
graduate student instructor 
and professor to write study 
abroad 
recommendation 
letters.
These 
recent 
events 
have exhibited the ongoing 
tensions and hard questions 
we must grapple with on 
our campus. As a university 
with 
a 
teeming 
student 
population, various schools 
of focus and a slew of student 
and political organizations, 
national 
and 
international 
issues 
are 
essentially 
our 
own. In the last few weeks, 
we’ve 
all 
grappled 
with 
many of these conflicting 
ideals. 
In 
addressing 
the 
issue directly this week, the 
University tried to resolve 
many of these conflicts, but 
many questions remain. We 
hope that the University’s 
newly formed panel — faculty 
who are aiming to address 
when academic freedom and 
political ideology come into 
conflict — involves students, 
and takes into account our 
role in these instances. The 
reverberating 
effects 
their 
statement and disciplinary 
measures had on students and 
faculty alike will continue 
to leave us questioning all of 
our roles as part of a single 
academic community.

Q

uoting Martin Luther King 
Jr., former President Barack 
Obama often stated, “The 
arc of the moral universe 
is long, but it bends toward justice.” 
Contrary to optimistic interpretation, 
this statement does not attest to the 
supposed inertia of justice or equality. 
Indeed, history’s darkest moments 
provide plentiful proof that apathy, 
and the assumption of inevitable 
righteousness that gives rise to it, can 
preclude the march of progress, and at 
times even reverse it. Sadly, we often 
partake in this apathy by allowing 
ourselves to forget the moments and 
movements that precipitated great 
instances of progress, be they equal 
rights written into law or the inclusive 
attitudes that breathe life into these 
liberties.
This coming Tuesday, Oct. 16, 
serves as a chance to remember one 
such moment. It marks the 50th 
anniversary of a silent protest that has 
found a worthy complement in former 
quarterback 
Colin 
Kaepernick’s 
actions on the football field, one that 
took place in a crowded stadium and 
ultimately found itself at the center 
of something much larger. Captured 
forever in a photograph that embodies 
the tempest of 1968 like no other 
photograph can, the national anthem 
protest by African-American U.S. 
Olympians Tommie Smith and John 
Carlos has solidified their legacy as one 
of legitimate resistance.
The 1968 Summer Olympics in 
Mexico City, like others before them, 
were supposed to be exercises in 
wholesome athletic competition, but 
that did not exempt them from the 
turbulence of that year. America’s 
racial and domestic wounds were 
still fresh four months after the 
assassination of presidential candidate 
Robert F. Kennedy and six months 
after the assassination of civil rights 
leader Martin Luther King Jr. The 
violence seemed to follow American 
athletes to the Olympics — just two 
weeks before Smith and Carlos 
would mount the podium, dozens 
of students were ruthlessly gunned 
down by Mexican soldiers following 
weeks of protests.
It was still in America, however, 
where Smith and Carlos had the least 
to be happy about. As if systemic racial 
prejudice was not enough, only slightly 
more than half of African-American 
adults held high school degrees in 
1968, and less than a tenth had gone 
on to earn bachelor’s degrees. These 
despairingly low rates of educational 
attainment, paling in comparison to 
similar measures for whites, spoke 
to the fallacy of an American Dream 
for all.
Smith and Carlos wanted to do 
something about it and demanded 
better treatment for Black athletes 
by organizing the Olympics Project 
for Human Rights earlier that year. 
They initially considered boycotting 
the 1968 Olympics, but later decided 
to compete in order to give their 
campaign a more visible platform. At 
a time when most white Americans 
still winced at the very suggestion 

of integrated neighborhoods, Smith 
knew that sports gave minorities like 
him and Carlos a real voice, reflecting 
later that, “We had to be seen because 
we couldn’t be heard.”
By today’s standards, the defiant 
salute during the rendition of “The 
Star-Spangled Banner” that Smith 
and Carlos chose to protest these 
grievances was a relatively passive 
gesture. Even as they clenched their 
fists and donned symbolic clothing to 
convey their dissatisfaction with the 
status quo, they made sure to stand 
for the entire duration of the national 
anthem. And, though it is probably 
more a reflection of devolving 
presidential 
temperaments 
than 
anything else, then-president Lyndon 
B. Johnson and then-presidential 
candidate 
Richard 
Nixon 
were 
silent about the whole affair, while 
Kaepernick’s anthem protests have 
inspired rather undignified words 
from President Donald Trump.
However, society’s standards have 
evidently evolved since then. Smith 
and Carlos would not be icons today 
if their protest was well-received by 
Americans. They were expelled from 
the stadium and suspended from 
the U.S. Olympic team following 
the ceremony, and death threats 
predictably followed. Life was not 
made easy for them. Yet, to this day, 
neither regrets the courageous actions 
they took to show the public their 
struggle at home. Whatever they 
accomplished in Mexico City was 
clearly worth it.
But what exactly was it that Smith 
and Carlos accomplished with their 
gesture? They did not articulate a 
specific policy to alleviate the ills of 
Black America, nor did they put forth 
the funds to elevate their fellow, lower-
class African Americans, actions 
often demanded of those who dare 
to gripe about discrimination. Just 
as they do not aspire for acceptance 
in the mainstream, effective social 
movements do not often set their 
sights on an immediate redirection 
of policy. At a time when even violent 
dispersal of American protesters was 
widely supported, gaining the support 
of an American majority, especially for 
an act of protest during the national 
anthem, was grossly infeasible for 
activists.
Instead, in democratic societies like 
America, legitimate resistance against 
unjust status quos has nearly always 
relied on the ability of movements 
to capture the complacency of the 
uninterested majority and steer it 
toward a path of liberalization. This 
agitation, an inherent disruption and 
inconvenience to the majority, is what 
engenders a sense of injustice, and 
demand for subsequent change, where 
there was none before. When people 
like Smith and Carlos turn what should 
be a moment of personal pride into 
one of complaining about America’s 
problems at home — yes, complaining 
— then the rest of the country begins to 
see how real their anger must be, and in 
doing so, embarks on a journey toward 
increased tolerance and acceptance.
The work of Martin Luther King 

Jr. embodies this well: King did 
not expect to see a drastic decrease 
in 
anti-miscegenation 
sentiment 
in his lifetime, nor did he directly 
lobby legislators to mandate public 
acceptance of interracial marriage. 
But, the mere presence of his 
“radical” calls for racial equality, 
along with other, subtler attempts at 
normalizing interracial relations in 
the national discourse, helped make 
that evolution in racial attitudes a 
reality — contributing to an American 
tradition of using expansive platforms 
for meaningful speech.
By this measure, the decision 
by former San Francisco 49ers 
quarterback Colin Kaepernick in 
2016 to refuse to stand for the national 
anthem, since carried on by other NFL 
players, is simply a continuation of 
this tradition. Kaepernick’s kneeling 
during the anthem at NFL games 
was his way of using his platform for 
political means, like Smith and Carlos. 
In his case, it was to call attention to 
what he views as disproportionate 
police brutality towards African 
Americans, certainly a sacrifice if one 
takes into account his being effectively 
blackballed from the NFL and 
receiving death threats.
From the perspective of Kaepernick, 
there is no platform better to project 
dissatisfaction with the current state 
of affairs than the national anthem, 
our symbolic embodiment of the state 
itself. This sentiment was clearly not 
shared by Kaepernick’s employers or, 
as of the latest polls, a majority of the 
country as well.
Nevertheless, 
Kaepernick 
has 
demonstrated his desire to respect the 
men and women in uniform who have 
reason to view the anthem as more 
than a symbol. Instead of fixating on 
the supposed patriotism of his kneeling, 
we should ask ourselves whether his 
gesture was any more disrespectful 
than that of Smith and Carlos in 1968 at 
the Olympics, which attracted similar 
criticisms and backlash. For without 
the actions of Smith and Carlos and the 
like, the current atmosphere would not 
even allow Kaepernick to take a knee, 
and much less sit, for the anthem, nor 
would it allow Nike to successfully use 
his protest in a popular ad campaign.
That Kaepernick’s actions do not 
immediately fix the attitudes he takes 
issue with, or that he is generally 
not viewed favorably by his fellow 
athletes or Americans, is no reason 
to dismiss his protest as empty or 
unpatriotic. In fact, this view would 
constitute a failure on our part to 
recognize those who legitimately 
resist injustices, injustices that might 
not be solved by the next year or even 
the next generation. By definition, the 
Kaepernicks of the world do not often 
find majority approval in the present, 
but instead in the future. Tommie 
Smith said it best when recalling his 
controversial actions in Mexico City: 
“We were not wrong. We were only 
ahead of our time.”

A column about the column
L

ast week, after I shared my 
column about accepting my 
fat, curvy body on Facebook, 
I 
was 
flooded 
with 
support 
and 
recognition from my 
friends, family, teachers 
and 
even 
strangers. 
Everyone 
was 
kind 
and 
thoughtful 
in 
ways I never imagined. 
Reading some of the 
comments brought me 
to tears. I recognized 
how difficult it is to talk 
about insecurities, and 
there isn’t much space or a platform 
where people feel comfortable to do 
this. 
I’m still humbly surprised by the 
amount of attention l received from 
my community. And I’m happy I was 
able to be there for my fellow bigger-
bodied people — helping share our 
experiences for those who were not 
aware. But I am still exploring notions 
of body acceptance and positivity, 
notions I was not able to cover in just 
one column.
I try to live my life like an open 
book — I keep very few things to 
myself. As an extrovert, I normally 
tell people things without them even 
asking because I need to process my 
thoughts out loud with my friends or 
really anyone who is around. After 
releasing so many closed-off thoughts 
for my whole community to see, I was 
emotionally drained. Whether it was 
reliving the fatphobia I wrote about 
as everyone was reading it, having 
conversations about my body every 
day for almost two weeks, or trying 

to keep up with all of my school work 
and other commitments, I did not have 
much time for myself.
Last Tuesday, skipping 
class and procrastinating 
an assignment, as usual, I 
began listening to a new 
podcast 
called 
“Pretty 
Big Deal” by supermodel 
and body activist Ashley 
Graham. I have been 
looking 
up 
to 
Ashley 
Graham 
ever 
since 
I 
watched her Ted Talk 
about being a plus-size 
model and accepting her 
body. In the podcast, she was telling 
her interviewee, Kim Kardashian, 
how sometimes it is exhausting to 
always have to talk about her body, but 
it is a part of her job as a model, activist 
and just being herself. I was relieved 
to find that this emotional exhaustion 
was normal. That is, another woman 
like me had felt the same way and were 
out there sharing their experience.
As I’m continuing to express 
vulnerability and write about my 
experiences, I’m making myself open 
to having more conversations with 
people about my body. Even though 
this is something that is new to me and 
once scared me, I hope talking about 
it becomes normal and comfortable 
with time. With all of this in mind, 
I still need to be kind to myself and 
allow time to recharge, reflect and 
rest. This way I’m not too emotionally 
exhausted and can continue spitting 
truths.
Another topic discussed in the 
podcast that piqued my interest was 
the privilege and platform white 

curvy woman have in today’s market. 
Curvy, larger bodies are not a new 
type of body. There have always been 
fat, curvy, thick women, but recently, 
the fashion industry has allowed for 
primarily white women to represent 
this population. This is incredibly 
misleading, as there are fat, large 
people of all identities who need 
representation as well.
Looking back at my article, I 
shared several accounts of body 
activists who were curvy, full women 
but most of them were white women 
with hourglass figures. As a white 
woman, I’m aware of the privilege 
that people of my race and size are 
receiving representation. With this 
in mind, I want to share accounts 
led by women of color I follow that 
have amazing content, like one of my 
favorite musical artists, Lizzo. She is 
incredibly authentic in her music and 
posts about how much she loves her 
body. Also, check out model Sonny 
Turner, because she posts bomb 
unedited photos and is a hair icon. 
In addition, you should look at body 
advocate 
@p.skaguya’s 
beautiful 
pictures and videos of her photo 
shoots and everyday life. 
I’m not sure if I was entirely ready 
to release my column when I did, but 
I definitely learned a lot about myself 
and the fact that I have a new platform 
to advocate for beautiful, fat, thick and 
curvylicious people. If you want to 
chat about this more, reach out to me. 
 
I’m more than happy and ready to dive 
deeper with all of you.

FROM THE OPINION EDITORS

When academic freedoms collide
T

he sometimes contentious relationship between free speech and 
academic equity at the University of Michigan came to a head this 
week. In a letter to the University community, University President 
Mark Schlissel and Provost Martin Philbert stated that two instructors — 
who recently denied letters of recommendation for study abroad programs 
in Israel due to their own support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions 
movement — did not meet University expectations for the behaviors of 
instructors. Separately, The Michigan Daily and The Detroit News obtained 
a letter from Interim LSA Dean Elizabeth Cole, informing one of the 
instructors, John Cheney-Lippold, associate professor in the Department of 
American Culture, that his actions violated University policy, and he would 
be disciplined with loss of a merit raise and delay of his planned sabbatical.

“This interview is so fire the 
alarms went off!”
Kim Petras, pop’s newest “it 
girl,” was entirely unphased 
when interrupted by the fire 
alarms that went off during 
our 
conversation. 
Calm 
and 
confident, she perfectly mirrors 
the music she has been working 
on for years, and she never misses 
a beat both in conversation and in 
her work as an artist.
“After 
working 
on 
music 
since I was like 13, 14 years 
old, I started writing, started 
being really obsessed with it. 
So (gaining recognition has) 
been really amazing, I kind of 
performed to semi-empty clubs 
my whole life and really hustled 
really hard to get recognition 
and stuff like that,” Petras said. 
“So it feels really amazing, and 
I’m just really thankful that I get 
the opportunity to play to packed 
clubs and sold out shows.”
Petras’s hard work is clearly 
starting to pay off as evidenced 
in her rapidly growing fan base 
while earning her an opening 
slot on Troye Sivan’s current 
tour. Her artistic vision has been 
influenced by this struggle, often 
offering a foil to the fantasies she 
weaves into her songs.
“‘I Don’t Want It at All,’ for 
example — I wrote that in a 
shitty apartment, like sleeping 
on a futon. I sometimes write 
songs about how I dream about 
my life or how I fantasize about 
life. For me, as a kid, loving pop 
music, growing up loving pop, I 
ran home from school everyday 
to watch the new Gwen Stefani 
music video, and I just like live in 
it and forget about my problems 
and school,” she said. “To this 
day, a good song can make me 
forget all my problems and just 
be happy for three and a half 
minutes, so to me that’s the most 
beautiful thing about music. So 
that’s what I’m trying to create, 
that’s what I’m trying to do for 
my fans.”
To date, Petras now has 
a repertoire of eight singles 
and a seven track Halloween-
themed EP titled TURN OFF 
THE LIGHTS, VOL. 1. While a 
relatively newer artist, her music 
is as addictive as anything you’d 
expect from a veteran of pop, 
which is likely a product of her 
wide list of influences. Petras 
isn’t just a massive pop fan, but 
an artist who draws inspiration 
from a wide array of genres and 
musicians.
“I really am a fan of all music. 
Especially currently, there’s so 

much amazing rap happening. I’m 
just a huge fan of the new Travis 
Scott album ASTROWORLD. I’m 
really into Rae Sremmurd; my 
friends lil aaron and Baby E have 
some amazing songs coming 
out,” she noted. “I’m just making 
a bunch of playlists recently. And 
I’ve been listening to the first 
Beyoncé album Dangerously In 
Love a bunch.”
What is most impressive about 
Petras’s debut music is that it’s 
high quality pop spread across 
a wide spectrum of sub-genres. 

There’s the hard-pressed verses 
and lackadaisical chorus of “All 
The 
Time,” 
the 
R&B-tinted 
“Slow It Down,” sugary pop on 
“Heart to Break” and the house-
pop hybrid “In The Next Life.” If 
her track record is any indication, 
then Petras is an artist with 
almost unlimited potential and 
flexibility: “My goal is always to 
keep growing and to not repeat 
myself, to do whatever feels right 
and to write authentic songs to 
me. I’m going to continue doing 
that really,” she said.
Petras writes music not just for 
herself, but also with and for her 
best friends: “We love to put on a 
song that we love and scream at 
the top of our lungs and go really 
crazy, and I want to create that 
same thing.” And this idea seeps 
into her collaborations as well. 
In the past, she has worked with 
Charli XCX, lil aaron and Baby 
E, and also revealed that she has 
collaborations 
with 
SOPHIE 
coming out in the near future.
“I have collaborations with 
SOPHIE coming out, so that’s 
really exciting, I’m a big SOPHIE 
fan. I always love collaborating 
with people like Charli and 
artists that write,” she revealed. 
“For me, I just want to write with 
people who care about their music 
and want to write songs and can 
write songs. So I collaborate a lot 
with one of my homies lil aaron, 
I’ve done a bunch with him. He’s 
one of the most talented writers 
I’ve ever met. I love to work with 
people that are friends and just 
have a good vibe. I like when it 
feels like hanging out with your 
friends, opposed to feeling like 
work and feeling stressful.”
The periodical release of her 
singles over eight months leading 
up to the release of her EP on 

Oct. 1st (the perfect gift for the 
beginning of the Gay Christmas 
Season) was a purposeful decision 
from a modern artist of the 21st 
century. In an effort to build up 
hype around each release, Petras 
and her team made this decision 
to release a single every month, 
which clearly paid off given her 
current popularity.
“Even before I put up “I 
Don’t Want It at All” I had these 
songs ready to go. We were just 
thinking about how to release 
it best and to break me as a new 
artist. And especially now, I just 
love how rappers are doing. They 
just constantly put out new work 
and new mixtapes — there’s kind 
of no rules for that,” she said. 
“I think in this streaming era, 
you know, artists just have to 
do things differently, and how 
artists work is going to be so 
different from now in a while. 
It was exciting to not release it 
as an album, but to drop a new 
song every month. Every month 
we could get more playlisting, we 
could get a new set of eyeballs on 
each song.”
Along with her incredible 
talent, Petras is an absolute 
inspiration 
to 
the 
LGBT 
community. Being queer herself, 
she 
proudly 
discusses 
her 
beginnings in queer clubs and 
blossoming popularity within 
the LGBT community that has 
begun to infect the mainstream. 
Now, opening for fellow queer 
artist Troye Sivan, the duo are 
alighting 
crowds 
with 
their 
energy and pride.
“This tour has been such an 
amazing LGBT — like 20-gay-
teen — moment. I love Troye 
and what he stands for. I love 
his music so much, and I think 
he’s an amazing artist. And I 
think it’s great that LGBT artists 
are getting recognized for their 
work rather than their sexuality 
or their gender identification. 
I think that’s such an amazing 
thing that’s happening right now, 
and I’m so glad to be a part of it,” 
she said.
Given her daring attitude, 
seductive 
fantasies 
and 
multifaceted talent, Kim Petras 
has arguably been 2018’s biggest 
breakout artist in the pop scene. 
Her creativity and passion bleeds 
into her music, with pomp and 
energy that let her listeners melt 
into her world. If Petras is any 
indication, there’s a reason pop 
music has always been one of the 
most boundary-defining genres, 
and if she continues to deliver, we 
have some incredible content to 
look forward to.
This Sunday, you can catch 
Kim Petras as she opens for 
Troye Sivan at the Fox Theater.

RYAN COX / DAILY

Prominent 
Chinese 
artist, 
filmmaker and educator Xu Bing 
visited the University’s Museum of 
Art (UMMA) this past Sunday to 
give a lecture entitled “The Origins 
of Creativity” as part of the Penny 
Stamps School of Art & Design’s 
ongoing speaker series. Bing’s work 
has always been highly reactive 
to his surrounding environment, 
both in China and the U.S., as his 
wide array of multimedia work — 
although often based in tradition 
— is always in dialogue with the 
present.
At a recent retrospective exhibit 
of Bing’s work in his hometown of 
Beijing, Bing — as the curator of his 
own work — pondered the question: 
“Where does this ability to make 
creative works come from?”
Having 60 works from his 
40-year career all in the same 
place at once, it seemed like several 
different artists were responsible 
for the work on display. Where did 
these varying inspirations come 
from?
Bing’s 
earliest 
work 
of 
prominence, “Book From the 
Sky,” came in 1987, the same year 
he completed his Masters of Fine 
Art at the Central Academy of 
Fine Arts. The vast work featured 
large scrolls that spanned the 
length of the room, both lying 
flat against the walls and draped 
from the ceiling. Beneath the 
immersive environment of scrolls 
are 
luxurious 
and 
carefully 
bound books containing the same 
characters. For those illiterate 
in Chinese, the exhibit creates 
an almost holy environment of 
Chinese 
language. 
For 
those 

literate, however, it creates a 
confounding and uncomfortably 
unfamiliar illusion of knowledge.
Every day of Bing’s childhood, 
his father would make him fill 
one page per day with Chinese 
characters that “followed the 
literary 
tradition 
of 
China.” 
Happening all around him at the 
time, however, was Chairman 
Mao’s reorganization of the entire 
Chinese language. In a time of 
increasing global connectedness, 
such rigid enforcement of the rules 
of language made no sense to Bing.
Thus, 
reacting 
to 
his 
environment, 
Bing 
dedicated 
several years to formulating 4,000 
fake Chinese characters on wood 
blocks to be neatly printed onto 
these scrolls. They are a complete 
mockery of the subjectivity and 
limitations of language. They were 
also a perceived as a threat to the 
Chinese government. And, as such, 
Bing relocated to the U.S. in 1990.
“The path every artist takes 
isn’t always under their control,” 
Bing said in his lecture. Art is the 
manifestation of each individual’s 
“cultural-genetic code.” When we 
take thinking to unfamiliar places, 
this is the realm from which we 
can create. In this way, art, just 
like Bing’s forced relocation, is not 
planned out.
Bing characterizes his early 
works in the U.S. as “existing in 
a place between two cultures.” 
His first exhibit in the U.S. — 
“Transformations” — translates 
a text from English to French 
to German and so on until it is 
eventually translated to Chinese, 
at which point it’s essentially 
nonsensical. Ironically, the lecture 
itself was a display of this loss of 
meaning, as Bing had to continually 
correct his English translator in a 

comically clear display of his point.
Bing continued producing art 
that is more than initially meets 
the eye for the next two decades. 
He’s had an ongoing series of 
“Background Story” works that 
look like ancient Chinese ink 
paintings but are actually milky 
glass backgrounded by plants. His 
largest recent work, “The Phoenix 
Project,” transforms the remains 
of construction site debris into two 
100-foot long phoenixes. Covered 
in a careful arrangement of LED 
lights, the phoenixes represent 
the transformation of the ugly 
process of rapid urbanization into 
something beautiful.
For Bing, while art is often 
in conversation with the past, it 
should never imitate it. Artistic 
ability is not dependent on one’s IQ 
or historical knowledge. Good art 
always reacts to the present. While 
many of Bing’s works appear to 
follow Chinese tradition, they are 
all in one way or another layered 
responses to current local and 
global events.
“Dragonfly Eyes,” Bing’s latest 
project, is no different. Bing has 
always had an acute awareness of 
the environment he interacts with 
on a daily basis. In “Dragonfly 
Eyes,” a storyline is made using 
a composite of real surveillance 
footage and acted out scenes. In 
this sense, the whole world is a 
film set. The work, intentionally 
shocking, blurs the line between 
reality and cinema.
This 
presentation 
was 
sponsored by the University’s 
Confucius Institute, Lieberthal-
Rogel Center for Chinese Studies, 
the Penny Stamps School of Art & 
Design, Museum of Arts and the 
Department of Film, Television 
and Media Studies.

AUDIOTREE ARTIST PROFILE

When 
a 
friend 
of 
mine 
suggested I listen to a band 
called Palm, I asked what genre 
they fell under. My question was 
greeted with something along 
the lines of: “Uhhh, I don’t know. 
I think they’re kind of DIY? 
Maybe Art Rock?” At that point, I 
still didn’t know what to expect.
Then 
I 
actually 
listened 
to Palm, and I understood 
my friend’s ambiguity. With 
so many different influences 
present — lyrically, sonically 
and rhythmically — it’s a little 
overwhelming at first, but in the 
best way.
A quick Google search for the 
genre “art rock” suggests artists 
like King Crimson and David 
Bowie. To me, those artists 
are drastically different. Even 
some of Bowie’s later work (see: 
Blackstar) is quite different from 
any of King Crimson’s material. 
The only common denominator 
is some elements of their music 
are derived from rock music. 
So, I guess, in a way, you could 
say Palm is art rock because 
of the fact that they borrow so 
many elements from rock but 
view those elements through an 
avant-garde approach.
The more I listened to the 
group, especially after the release 
of their newest full-length studio 
album, Rock Island, the more 
I wondered how the band was 
able to develop that signature 
sound they had. Luckily, I had 
the incredible opportunity to 
not only see the band live, but 
speak with bassist Gerasimos 
Livitsanos 
and 
guitarist 
/ 
vocalist Eve Alpert about their 
sound, and how they developed 
into the genre-defying band they 
are today.
One of the best aspects of the 
band’s sound is just how unique 
it actually is. With Brian Wilson-
sounding vocal lines, prog / 
math rock influenced rhythms 
and an overall sound that could 
be described as almost island-
infused indie rock, they seem 
to sound like every band I can 

imagine, and, at the same time, 
like none of them at all.
“We all listen to tons of music. 
It’s where we get our pleasure 
from,” 
Alpert 
said. 
When 
working on their latest album, 
however, Alpert says the group 
listened to a lot of Footwork, a 
movement of music based out 
of Chicago involving spastic 
rhythms and beats accompanied 
by, at times, extremely lush 
soundscapes.
“This label called Orange 
Milk was really inspiring. Not to 
say that it rubbed itself into our 
songwriting, but it did in weird 
ways.”
When it came to writing the 
record itself, the group attributes 
a lot of their songwriting process 
to practice.
“We practice all the time, and 
generally there’s one core idea 
that comes in, and then we jam 
to it,” Alpert commented. “And 
then once it clicks, it clicks,” 
Livitsanos replied.
In another interview, the band 
mentioned using a drum machine 
as a compositional tool; putting 
on a random pattern while the 
guitars dissect it between the 
two of them and drummer Hugo 
Stanley plays a contrasting beat 
overtop. These rhythms written 
over the drum machine “felt 
integral to the song,” Alpert 
explained. But in regards to their 
sound, Rock Island features a 
variety of guitar sounds that don’t 
really sound like guitar. Using 
a MIDI (musical instrument 
digital interface) guitar effects 
controller, the band incorporates 
guitar tones that sound like a 
variety of other instruments, 
most notably steel drums.
“We started incorporating the 
MIDI guitar when we started 
writing 
the 
record,” 
Alpert 
explained, “And we just used 
the sounds we had on the synth 
module. We were just using the 
equipment we had.”
But the band sees themselves 
taking this sound in a slightly 
different direction in the future. 
As Livitsanos discussed: “We’re 
trying to program more of our 
own sounds. We kinda started 
with just what we had, but going 
forward, we definitely want to 

try generating things to sample, 
and sounds like that.”
Hearing Palm live, I was 
amazed 
at 
how 
close 
they 
sounded to the record. Every 
nuance present in the record 
was also there in the live 
performance. Many groups view 
live performance and recorded 
performances as two different 
things entirely. There are things 
you can do in a recording studio 
that you can’t do live on stage, 
and vice versa. Palm seems to be 
somewhere in the middle.
“I think we all want our 
live performance to be pretty 
raw. We’ve come up being 
influenced by a lot of punk or 
noisier music, so we want our 
live performance to be a little 
bit more unpredictable,” Alpert 
said.
Livitsanos responded, saying: 
“On Rock Island, there were 
certain things done for certain 
tracks, like some sort of drum 
loop in “Dog Milk,” for example, 
and then after it was recorded, we 
were like, ‘Oh, maybe we could 
try this a little bit differently for 
the live show’.”
“My hope is that we can write 
a record and then reinterpret it 
in a more raw way live,” Alpert 
said.
The band seems to be gaining 
traction in the music community. 
Audiotree was one of the band’s 
first festivals and it seems to be 
a new experience for them, but 
one they’re treating just like any 
other.
“I 
want 
us 
to 
always 
make mistakes,” Alpert said. 
“Sometimes it winds up working 
and sometimes it doesn’t. It 
makes it all more worthwhile.”
“Both for us and as audience 
members, I think it make it more 
fun,” Livitsanos replied.
“We’re 
definitely 
not 
a 
conventional festival band, and 
I think we’re still figuring it all 
out, you know?”
For a band that’s still figuring 
things out, Palm certainly seems 
to be a well-polished chaos 
machine, putting out material 
that’s pushing the limits and 
putting on one of the best 
live shows I’ve seen in recent 
memory.

When fellow Daily Arts Writer 
Sean Lang and I first walked 
into the press tent at Audiotree 
Music Festival, I walked up to 
Diet Cig and introduced myself, 
thinking they were waiting for 
us to start the interview
Instead, it turned out we 
were 
interrupting 
another 
conversation they were having.
As I called myself an idiot a 
million times in my head, their 
manager came over to us and 
apologized 
profusely, 
saying 
some random fans walked up 
and started talking to them, 
and he allowed it, thinking they 
were us.
After a failed first attempt at 
contact, I finally had a chance to 
properly introduce myself. What 
I received in return were two of 
the most genuine smiles from 
singer / guitarist Alex Luciano 
and drummer Noah Bowman. 
They seemed to apologize for 
themselves, 
for 
no 
reason. 
Suddenly my nerves from before 
seemed to vanish as we casually 
slipped into a conversation that 
was supposed to be classified as 
an interview.
After 
an 
energetic 
performance, we got to sit down 
with Diet Cig and talk to them 
about their music, creating safe 
spaces and DIY.
The Michigan Daily: Sean 
and I are both involved in the 
DIY scene back in Ann Arbor, 
and I know that you all had your 
start in your local scene. Do you 
still think, despite playing these 
bigger festivals, some of those 
lessons you learned in the scene 
are still useful to you today?
Luciano: Yeah, I mean, we 
came up in the DIY scene. Our 
first 
shows 
were 
basement 
shows, and it kind of influenced 

who we are as a band. I think it 
will always kind of contribute 
to who we are as a band because 
that’s where we came from. It’s 
cool because we do get to play 
these larger festivals, and I feel 
because we played DIY shows 
we’re really good at breaking 
down and getting our shit out 
of the way because, you know, if 
you’re playing a basement show, 
you need to make sure all the 
bands play before the cops come, 
you gotta move on.
Bowman: Yeah, and with 
troubleshooting, 
too. 
We’re 
really good at thinking to 
ourselves, 
“OK 
this 
isn’t 
working, but we can make it 
work.”
Luciano: Yeah, and it’s nice 
because we do get to play these 
festivals but we still get to play 
basement shows. We have a 
really amazing agent who’s 
super down to book us for DIY 
shows, which is something a lot 
of bands fear with getting an 
agent, that they won’t be able to 
play house shows. But Brianna, 
our agent, has still booked us for 
some really cool shows, so it’s 
still a part of who we are.
TMD: Well we’re glad that 
you’re sticking true to your DIY 
roots. One of my favorite things 
about the DIY community is how 
important activism is within the 
community. And I noticed on 
stage that you took the time to 
address a few issues, which is 
something that can be important 
for artists to do. But for you, do 
you think that it’s important for 
an artist to use their platform 
to talk about these issues and 
create a safe space and all of 
that?
Luciano: I think it’s every 
band’s choice. I feel like with 
the platform we have — which 
I feel very grateful for having, 
and these are things we care 
about — it’s not super hard to say 

something like, “Hey, go vote,” 
especially when you have a 
microphone right in front of you. 
When it comes to having safer 
spaces at shows, I think it is the 
responsibility of the artists. No 
one wants to be at a show where 
they’re fearful of being touched 
inappropriately, or getting hurt 
because some person won’t stop 
dancing and hitting people. So 
I think at least for us it’s super 
important to make a climate 
that everyone can come to. 
When your space isn’t safe, it 
just excludes people, and we just 
want everyone to be included.
TMD: Have you ever had 
a show where you had to 
address seeing something in the 
audience?
Bowman: Oh yeah, we’ve had 
a couple times. I forget where it 
was, but some dude was being a 
total fucker, and we were like, 
“It’s OK you’re having fun, but 
can you just mind yourself?” 
He was a big guy, and there 
was a bunch of smaller people. 
But then on the next song, he 
was worse, so we just stopped 
and said, “You gotta stop.” And 
the coolest thing was that the 
bartender stood up on the bar 
and just pulled him over.
Luciano: We have had to 
stop and just be like, “We’re not 
gonna play again until you chill 
out.” We want people to enjoy 
our shows, and stopping for a 
second to make sure everything 
is OK is definitely worth it.
TMD: I know a lot of bands 
will go up on stage, make a 
little chit-chat and not say 
much else, but I like how you 
all acknowledge the audience 
frequently.
Luciano: I feel like we’re 
pretty 
transparent 
too, 
like 
our stage persona and our 
online persona and all that is 
pretty much who we are. You 
don’t really get anything else. 

Diet Cig talks DIY, using 
a platform and astrology

It’s kinda cool that we can be 
personal like that, and it makes 
for a nice community.
TMD: Well on a little bit of a 
different note, I know you talked 
about astrology a little on stage. 
Personally, I’m a Capricorn, but I 
really don’t feel like I am.
Luciano: No way, Noah’s a 
Capricorn.
TMD: Do you identify with 
Capricorn?
Bowman: Oh yeah. Do you 
think I’m a Capricorn?
Luciano: Yeah, you’re like a 
textbook Capricorn: setting the 
plan, super chill, knows what’s 
going on, you know.
Bowman: Sometimes it sucks, 
and I wish I wasn’t, you know, 
it’s like I gotta know what’s 

going on all the time and be 
super organized and all that.
Luciano: We’re a good match 
though, Michelle and Barack 
Obama are a Leo-Capricorn. 
Michelle is a Capricorn, if that 
makes you feel any better.
TMD: You know, the more I 
don’t like being a Capricorn, the 
more I realize I am one.
Luciano: 
Yeah 
but 
our 
personalities 
go 
really 
well 
together. I’m really extroverted 
and really all over the place, 
while Noah is really calm and 
collected. He’s the one that 
really gets it done while I’m like, 
“AHHHH! I have a crazy idea!”
TMD: So, on stage you said 
you’re a Leo sun, and a Cancer 
moon; so my follow up would be 

what’s your rising?
Luciano: Sagittarius. Which 
I feel goes really (well) with my 
Leo sun because they’re both 
fire signs basically saying, “I’m 
here.”
TMD: Yeah I can definitely 
see that. I sometimes I want to 
say that it’s crap, but the more I 
look at it …
Luciano: 
Well 
there 
are 
so many different versions of 
yourself, you’re not just (a) one 
sided person. Sometimes maybe 
you’re feeling your Cancer rising 
... or your Aquarius moon, you 
know. It’s fun to just talk about 
yourself. It’s so easy to be like, 
“What’s your sign?” I love 
astrology. Thanks so much for 
asking me about it.

“Oh, you’re not gonna like this 
analogy,” said Brigitte Naggar, 
the mind behind Common Holly. 
Unfortunately, it was the only 
one she found suitable, so she 
plowed forward: “It was like 
I was a cow that needed to be 
milked, otherwise I would’ve 
exploded.”
The 
Montreal-based 
songwriter confessed that she 
hardly picked up her guitar 
during her years at university 
but, after a breakup in the 
year 
following 
graduation, 
found much-needed relief in 
songwriting. It was then that 
her current project, Common 
Holly, began to take shape, 
though music had already been 
a significant part of Naggar’s life 
for many years. 
“I was put into piano lessons 
very early on, as we all were, 
I’m sure, and I did that for six 
years, and then I really just hated 
practicing so much, so I finally 
quit,” she said. Later, her father 
started giving her guitar lessons. 
She got her own when she was 16 
and began writing songs at the 
same time. One song she wrote 
then, “New Bed,” is the closing 
track of her 2017 debut, Playing 
House, though she expressed 
that she had been hesitant to 
include it.
“Actually, 
it 
was 
Devon 
(Mane, the album’s producer and 
touring guitarist) that convinced 
me to redo (“New Bed”) and 
make it album appropriate, and 
now I’m bound to it for life,” 
she added with a tone of light-
hearted resignation.
Though she has been writing 
songs since age 16, Naggar told 
me that she “truly despised 
performing. It’s not my thing.” 
This was interesting to hear, 
given 
that 
she 
would 
be 
performing on the main stage of 
Audiotree Music Festival on the 
day following our interview, and 
she admitted that her attitude 
toward it had changed, at least 
in part.
“I 
don’t 
(still 
despise 
performing). I like it, I think 
because 
— 
well, 
obviously 
because I’m used to it. I think 
I’ve almost found a way to 
make it feel sincere and not 
performative. 
I 
think 
that’s 
probably my struggle with it, is 
the separation between stage 
person and audience, and stage 
person versus ‘you’ person,” 
she elaborated. And although 
she is capable of finding that 
performer-audience connection 
more easily when playing solo, 
she does “try to tour with bands 
whenever it’s affordable … and 

then give a sort of surround 
sound experience.”
Bringing a band on tour is also 
helpful in purely logistical terms.
“I do tour solo. It’s hard 
though, it’s a lot of stuff to carry,” 
she said, and having a friend 
or two along might also keep 
her accountable itinerary-wise. 
When she does tour solo, she 
fills her downtime with almost 
excessive excitement: “Thumb 
twiddling … I don’t know, what do 
people do, Facebook? I sleep a lot. 
I visit friends if they’re in town … 
I spend a lot of time making sure 
I don’t miss buses or planes,” she 
told me, although it turned out 
she had missed a plane just the 
week prior: “It was like a major 
moment. You know when you 
consider yourself someone that 
doesn’t miss planes? And then 
you miss your first plane? I was 
really like, ‘Who am I?’”
This wasn’t the only time 
she confronted her self-identity 
during our interview. On the 
topic of when she had made 
the decision to pursue music 
professionally, 
questioned 
herself again: “I guess it was 
when … I had finished university 
— was that two years ago, or was 
it three? How old am I?”
Later, she would also mention 
a period of time over the summer 
when she found herself in crisis. 
She had studied religion and 
art history at school — “So I 
was really setting myself up for, 
like, tons of career options” — 
but had thought of continuing 
school to become a social worker 
or therapist, and was having 
doubts.
“I was like, ‘What am I doing 
with my life?’ and then I looked 
up the career path for therapists 
and the schooling and so on, 
and it seemed like by the time 
I was done with that and in the 
workforce I would be making 
the same amount of money as I 
would if I continued on in music, 
which is … fucked.”
She took a moment to express 
gratitude 
for 
support 
she’d 
thus far received in the form 
of grants from Canada and 
Quebec, and acknowledged that 
it’s pretty ridiculous that, as an 
independent artist, she hasn’t 
had to work another job for the 
past year.
It may be a tenuous link, but 
these aforementioned instances 
of self-doubt might just be 
related to her self-professed 
terrible memory. She mentioned 
her memory while discussing 
the concept of nostalgia, which 
flows freely from every corner 
of Playing House. Even the 
album cover, a photo of Naggar’s 
“grandmother and her cousin, 
in a ballet posture in Egypt, 
probably in the ’20s or ’30s,” 

invokes the vague but intensely 
melancholic 
feeling 
of 
time 
passed.
“I feel like I look at nostalgia 
in kind of a pragmatic way. 
I think it’s really useful as a 
processing function. I don’t 
think I’m a dweller, and that’s 
probably supported by the fact 
that I have a horrible memory,” 
she explained. “I think that 
that 
kind 
of 
manifests 
in 
Playing House, in the song ‘If 
After All’ — just talking about 
forgetting, 
learning 
lessons 
and then forgetting them and 
that being a constant source 
of frustration … I’m very much 
into processing now and then 
continuing 
to 
proceed 
with 
proceedings,” she added, the last 
three words accompanied by a 
self-deprecating laugh.
Before we wrapped up our 
conversation, I asked Naggar 
about her influences. She pointed 
to Chad VanGaalen, “who I’ve 
done shows with … You should 
check that out, definitely, the 
older albums,” she said after I 
expressed my unfamiliarity — “I 
know everyone’s like, ‘the older 
albums,’” she said with mocking 
affect, “But it’s true! There’s 
a quieter heart in them, or 
something.” This self-awareness 
and nearly constant qualification 
of 
claims 
was 
apparent 
throughout our interview, but 
shined here.
“Who 
else? 
D’Angelo, 
obviously,” she added, knowing 
full well that the R&B legend’s 
influence on her work is far from 
evident.
“Maybe Leonard Cohen for 
lyrics, maybe T. S. Eliot for 
poems. I used to like poems a 
lot, I don’t know what happened. 
I was, like, a poem kid,” she 
digressed, but we followed up on 
this idea of poems versus songs.
“If you’re writing a poem, 
the words have to stand for 
themselves, which is why I 
would never show anyone my 
poetry,” Naggar said. “I feel like 
singing and playing guitar, I can 
hide behind my guitar and my 
guitar can hide behind me, and 
it’s this great sort of protective 
coexistence.”
I pried once more about her 
claim to being a “poem kid,” 
asking whether she’d written a 
lot during her younger years.
“Didn’t we all?” she replied. 
“Don’t we still?”
Common Holly performed on 
Sunday, Sept. 23 at Audiotree 
Music Festival in Kalamazoo, 
but you can also catch them on 
tour with Detroit-based Anna 
Burch and Ann Arbor-native 
Fred Thomas — whose most 
recent album, Aftering, features 
Common Holly — on Oct. 25 at 
the Blind Pig in Ann Arbor.

Behind Enemy Lines: A conversation with 
Jonah Malkin, a Wisconsin broadcaster

By ETHAN WOLFE

Daily Sports Writer

The No. 12 Michigan football 
team has as much confidence as 
it’s had in two seasons, riding 
a five-game win streak into 
Saturday.
No. 15 Wisconsin is a team 
that’s looking to re-find that 
confidence. After a devastating 
home loss to BYU in Week Three, 
the Badgers have responded 
with a resounding road win at 
Iowa and a runaway victory 
over Nebraska. 
Unlike 
previous 
Wisconsin 
teams 
with 
powerhouse 
defenses, 
it’s 
the 
offense, 
led by running 
back 
and 
Heisman-
hopeful 
Jonathan 
Taylor, that is 
carrying 
the 
strongest team 
in the Big Ten West.
The Daily spoke to Jonah 
Malkin, a radio broadcaster 
for WSUM 91.7 FM Madison, 
to 
learn 
about 
Wisconsin’s 
strengths and weaknesses, and 
what to expect during Saturday’s 
high-stakes game at Michigan 
Stadium.
The Michigan Daily: What 
has been the atmosphere around 
the team since that loss to BYU?
Jonah Malkin: I’d say it’s 
cautiously optimistic. The reason 
is because after that BYU game, 
Wisconsin did respond well on 
the road at Iowa, had the bye 
week and collected another win 
a couple days ago at Nebraska. 
I 
say 
cautiously 
optimistic 
because the secondary — the 
defense is really banged up 
going into this weekend against 
Michigan. 
While 
there 
is 
certainly a lot of optimism and 
confidence brewing in the locker 
room, it’s cautious optimism 
because 
it’s 
gonna 
be 
the 
toughest atmosphere most likely 
that they’ve played this year, 
and they’re missing some key 
cogs on the defensive side. The 
confidence is still there, a lot of 
young guys are looking forward 

to the opportunity to step up.
TMD: 
What’s 
the 
injury 
report looking like? What impact 
will it have on the game?
Malkin: They’re gonna be 
missing a number of starters is 
what it seems like. About four 
of the starters are questionable. 
The 
defensive 
end, 
Isaiahh 
Loudermilk, 
isn’t 
gonna 
be 
playing, which is a big loss 
because Wisconsin doesn’t have 
a great pass rush at all. He was 
one of those guys in the front 
three in the 3-4 defense that 
could put pressure on opposing 
quarterbacks. Most importantly, 
though, in the secondary there’s 
a lot of guys on the injury report. 
Faion Hicks is questionable, 
D’Cota Dixon is questionable. 
They are both gonna play but 
they’re not 100 percent. Caesar 
Williams is probably not gonna 
play, 
he’s 
questionable, 
the 
starting 
cornerback. 
Scott 
Nelson is missing the first 
half because he was called 
for targeting at the end of the 
game against Nebraska. Deron 
Harrell, who is kind of a backup 
cornerback even though he got 
first-team snaps Saturday, is 
also questionable with a head 
injury.
I’m 
concerned 
about 
the 
secondary because, to me, the 
passing game is gonna be the 
difference in the game. It’s 
gonna come out to the play of 
Shea Patterson making long 
plays. 
The 
secondary 
is 
so 
beaten up and there’s a lot of 
young, inexperienced players 
and Wisconsin has already given 
up a number of big plays over 
the air so far this season. I have 
a feeling that that’s gonna be a 
difference in the game.
TMD: How do you assess 
Wisconsin opening as eight-
point underdogs at Michigan?
Malkin: I understand why 
they made that the line. I 
personally think it’s gonna be 
a closer contest, between three 
and six (points). I project it’ll be 
a low-scoring game, a 24-20 kind 
of game. But then again, I can 
understand why the line is what 
it is. A touchdown is a pretty 
fair assessment, especially on 
the road, first night game of the 
year. And the stakes couldn’t 
be higher for both teams. For 

both of these teams, this is the 
difference between which team 
still has a chance to make the 
playoff and who doesn’t.
TMD: Last year, Wisconsin 
finished third in total defense. 
At the moment, it’s ranked 41st 
in the country. Was a decline 
expected? What do you attribute 
that slide to?
Malkin: I don’t think anyone 
was 
expecting 
the 
defense 
to be nearly as dominant and 
elite as it was last year. It was 
an 
unreasonable 
expectation 
given how much turnover they 
lost — pretty much their entire 
front three and starters in the 
secondary. I don’t think people 
expected them to be 41st. There 
was more optimism surrounding 
the secondary in training camp 
and all the coaches were raving 
about the corners and safeties, 
and not as much about the 
defensive line. … They expected 
the offense to be the aspect of 
the team that will carry it, but 
I definitely think they expected 
the pass defense to be a little bit 
better. The rush defense is still 
respectable. … Overall, not an 
elite defense, not even top-10, 
but maybe a top-20 program was 

expected.
TMD: Is there an offensive 
weapon not named Jonathan 
Taylor that you expect could 
break out on Saturday?
Malkin: 
Jonathan 
Taylor 
is what he is, and obviously 
that’ll be crucial for Wisconsin 
to win. But I actually think it’s 
probably gonna be a big game 
for Jake Ferguson, the starting 
tight end. My guess is that he’ll 
be the security blanket that Alex 
Hornibrook is gonna rely on 
for third down opportunities. 
Michigan 
is 
(a 
good) 
pass 
defense, they’ve held opponents 
to the fewest passing yards per 
game in the country, so you’re 
not going to rip off too many big 
plays off of them. Third down 
conversion 
defense, 
they’re 
good but not unbreakable. The 
tight end play will be really big 
and Jake Ferguson — he’s led 
Wisconsin in receiving yards 
two of their five games. He may 
be targeted a lot more against 
Michigan.
TMD: Who will have the 
better 
day 
between 
Alex 
Hornibrook and Shea Patterson?
Malkin: That’s tough. I think 
Shea Patterson is innately the 

more talented quarterback. He’s 
by far much more of a dual-
threat, can scramble, mobile guy. 
Hornibrook’s not like that at all. 
I think Patterson will register 
more stats at the end of the day. 
He’s got a more explosive arm 
and can use his legs. I don’t think 
his completion percentage will 
be as good as Hornibrook, I think 
he’s a more accurate thrower 
on 
average. 
Not 
necessarily 
meaning that Hornibrook will 
complete more big play throws, 
but his percentage will be better. 
It’s hard to measure who will 
play better necessarily, but I do 
think Hornibrook will step up 
and play well on the road. He’s 
done it before, he doesn’t get 
fazed by pressure on the road. 
… If Michigan is gonna win, it’s 
gonna be on the play of their 
defense and not necessarily on 
Patterson making tremendous 
throws.
TMD: Prediction?
Malkin: I think the score will 
be 24-20 regardless of who wins. 
I believe in Wisconsin. Should 
they probably be favored? I don’t 
know, but I can see them still 
pulling out a win. It’ll be the 
hardest game of the year.

CAMERON HUNT/Daily
The Wolverines will face No. 15 Wisconsin on Saturday, a team featuring offensive threats like runing back Jonathan Taylor.


H

eading into 2008, 
the Michigan 
football team hadn’t 
had a losing season 
since the 1960s.
Under coaches Bo Schembechler, 
Gary Moeller and Lloyd Carr, 
the Wolverines developed into 
a perennial power in the Big 
Ten, always in the Rose Bowl 
conversation, and thus, the national 
spotlight.
But when Carr retired at the 
end of the 2007 season and Rich 
Rodriguez took his place, there 
was perhaps more doubt around 
the program than there had ever 
been. Rodriguez brought with him a 
spread offense that had never been 
run at Michigan, and the personnel 
he inherited was not suited for that 
play style.
All of those doubts were realized, 
as the Wolverines sputtered to a 3-9 
record.
Even still, there was one bright spot 
in the season.
On Sept. 28, in the 500th game in 
the history of Michigan Stadium, 
Michigan battled back from a 
19-0 halftime deficit to beat No. 9 

Wisconsin, 27-19, giving hope to a 
fanbase that had all but lost it.
Ten years later, the memory of 
that game is interesting. Especially 
lately, the Wolverines are in a much 
better spot than they were then. 
The Badgers are visiting Ann Arbor 
again this weekend, and Michigan is 
favored by nine points.
Most Wolverines fans would 
prefer to erase the memory of the 
Rodriguez Era. But that one game 
can be remembered as a positive, 
an emotional roller coaster and a 
signature win that the Michigan 
players from that year can hang 
their hats on.
This is the story of the largest 
comeback in the history of Michigan 
Stadium.
Mark Snyder, former Michigan 
beat reporter for The Detroit 
Free Press: Everything was 
the unknown, because they had 
changed this whole system, and it 
was gonna be this read option, and 
Michigan obviously didn’t have 

the personnel for that, especially 
the quarterback. They had Steven 
Threet as the quarterback, and he 
had transferred from Georgia Tech, 
and he was, you know, a pro-style 
quarterback, and that’s why he had 
come to Michigan. And he came to 
Michigan before Lloyd Carr left.
Steven Threet, Michigan 
quarterback, 2007-2009: I would 
say that when I did transfer, there 
wasn’t a discussion specifically my 
parents, myself and Coach Carr 
about a transition. Obviously, that 
was kind of in the wind, not for any 
reason other than his desires, but 
that was a possibility. But kind of 
given the consistency and stability 
of the University of Michigan 
football program to that point since 
the late 1960s, it didn’t seem like 
there was gonna be a drastic shift.
Kevin Koger, Michigan tight 
end, 2008-2012: It was a different 
perspective for me, just because I 
committed under Coach Carr, but 
I didn’t play under him. So I get in 
there, and Rich Rod’s the only thing 
I know. So it wasn’t weird for me in 
terms of having a coaching change, 
but I was just going off a lot of the 
older guys and how they felt. I 

think there was a mild uncertainty. 
I don’t know, unfortunately, how 
great our buy-in was at that time as 
a whole. I think there were some 
guys resistant to the change. I think 
that had a lot to do with the type of 
team that we had, and everybody 
was at fault. It wasn’t just the 
coaches, we just all weren’t on the 
same page. And I don’t think guys 
didn’t play hard or anything like 
that, I think, you know, we weren’t 
all on the same page that year, and 
expectations were high.
The Wolverines began their season 
with a 25-23 loss to Utah, a 16-6 win 
over Miami (OH) and a 35-17 loss to 
Notre Dame, falling to 1-2 before the 
Big Ten opener.
Koger: I think we always had 
confidence in ourselves. We always 
thought that, no matter what 
happened, like the Notre Dame 
game, if I remember correctly, 
we had a bunch of turnovers, you 
know, so it was a lot of, we felt, 
self-inflicted wounds. … We did 

beat Miami (OH), but we felt that 
the margin of victory should have 
been a lot bigger than it was. You 
know, so I think we were a little, not 
disappointed, but we expected more 
out of ourselves up to that point.
Snyder: So they go into this game 
with a chance for an upset, and 
Michigan, they’re used to big-time 
wins. … But I don’t think anybody 
expected they were going to win.
Wisconsin won its first three games 
of the season, rising to No. 9 in 
the AP rankings and establishing 
themselves as Big Ten and National 
Championship contenders.
Aubrey Pleasant, Wisconsin 
defensive back, 2005-2008: Yeah 
we were definitely going for it. 
I remember we were somewhat 
rated high, we were 3-0. You know, 
I feel at that time … I don’t know 
if (Michigan) started off the way 
they needed to that year, but we 
knew it was gonna be a competitive 
game. We knew we had to solidify 
ourselves on the road if we wanted 
to kind of push it through.
Threet: One thing I do remember 
is I didn’t even realize until we got 
onto the field and I saw the extra 
paint (that) it was the 500th game in 

Michigan Stadium. And that was not 
like, I didn’t walk into the stadium 
knowing, ‘Hey, this is 500. Let’s 
make it special.’
John Thompson, Michigan 
linebacker, 2004-2008: To us, 
it was the Big Ten opener. … 
Win at home, win the Big Ten 
and then compete for a national 
championship. In our eyes, it was, 
‘Alright, the preseason is over.’ We 
lost to Utah. Lost to Notre Dame. 
But the next game was the goal. So 
just open up the Big Ten, get ready 
to play and play to win.
Snyder: It was probably one of the 
worst halves of football that anyone 
had seen from Michigan in a long 
time, and everything that could go 
wrong went wrong. And so they’re 
going off the field at halftime, and all 
of the sudden, it was massive boos.
Thompson: Oh yeah, they were 
booing. They were booing, because 
they had a certain expectation. You 
know, you’re at Michigan, you’re 
expected to compete at a high level 

to perform.
Pleasant: Our big thing was that, 
even though we were winning, 
we still didn’t feel like we were 
playing our best, and we just was 
like, ‘Listen, this don’t happen in 
Michigan Stadium. With the fans 
booing, they’re gonna come out 
ready to go.’ We just needed to finish 
it out.
Rodriguez, after the game: If 
there was a hole to crawl into, I’m 
sure a bunch of us, including myself, 
would have wanted to crawl into 
that hole. … If you were anywhere 
in the Ann Arbor vicinity, you heard 
that.
Threet: I just remember the 
environment being, excuse my 
language, but, ‘Holy shit, what are 
we doing? We’re way better than 
this. Whether or not we’re better 
than the ninth-ranked team in the 
country at this moment, we’re way 
better than what we’re putting on 
the field. Let’s just do what we need 
to do.’
On the second drive of the second 
half, Michigan drove down the 
field, and Threet hit Koger for the 
Wolverines’ first points of the game, 
making it 19-7.

Koger: They went one-high safety, 
and (Pleasant) rolls down and I slip 
by him and I stay on the seam. And 
as soon as I get my head around, I 
see Steven throwing me the ball, so 
I catch it and scored, and my first 
thought was the night before we 
had clam chowder. But freshmen 
weren’t allowed to eat clam 
chowder. So I had an agreement 
with one of the older wide receivers 
that the next time I score, the next 
week, I get clam chowder. That next 
time happened to be the next day. So 
I was excited, and I was screaming 
on the field that I get clam chowder 
the next week.
Snyder: With (Koger’s touchdown), 
it’s still like, what is the plan for 
them to get back into the game. 
What’s gonna happen that’s unique 
to say, I mean, if you’re gonna make 
a comeback like that, something’s 
got to happen.
The teams traded punts back and 
forth, until the fourth quarter, when 
Michigan again drove down the 

field, capping off a 10-play, 84-yard 
drive with a 34-yard touchdown 
run from running back Brandon 
Minor. Wisconsin then took over 
with the ball on its own 25 with 10:27 
remaining in the game.
Threet: The Donovan Warren 
tipped ball.
Thompson: (Then-sophomore 
cornerback) Donovan made the 
play. I just executed. … Without him, 
I would have been running to the 
ball tackling.
Brad Nessler, ABC play-by-play 
analyst, on the live telecast of 
the game: (Wisconsin quarterback 
Allan) Evridge, quick slant, 
tipped up in the air and the ball is 
intercepted by Michigan! Down the 
sideline is John Thompson!
Thompson: I see the tight end, 
he was in my face, so I gave him a 
move, get up the field, and my whole 
defense was in front of me.
Koger: Those guys kind of created 
a convoy down the sideline. … Yeah, 
so he’s going down the sideline, 
and the sideline erupted. That’s 
probably one of the loudest I’ve 
heard Michigan Stadium. … they 
intercepted and scored, touchdown, 
and there was a Wisconsin guy 

chasing, and there was probably 
like, seven or eight Michigan guys 
on one Wisconsin guy, so it kinda 
looked like the Wisconsin guy got 
swallowed whole, enveloped by 
all the Michigan guys, because he 
was on the ground, and he was 
underneath them celebrating.
Wisconsin went three-and-out on its 
next possession, giving Michigan the 
ball back on its own 23-yard line, with 
8:14 remaining.
Nessler: Big hit on Brandon 
Minor… No, it’s Threet! Threet! 
Trying to run away from everybody!
Snyder: I remember this long run 
by Threet. You know, on a keeper. It 
must have been 50-something yards. 
And at that point, I mean, this is not 
what this guy does. He was athletic. 
He was sort of athletic, but he’s not 
like Denard Robinson.
Threet: That was the run system 
that made Rich Rod famous is the 
read option. I’m by no means the 
(former West Virginia quarterback) 
Pat White that he had previously,

“I don’t think any of the things I remember I want to forget”

‘Boos at the start and cheers at the end’


Mike Persak, Managing Sports Editor

DESIGN BY KATE GLAD

but it was a good play design, and I made the 
read. … Even the announcers think that Minor 
gets smacked in the background by, they had 
a really good defensive end at the time, and 
you know, he took off like a bat out of hell and 
went right for the running back, so really wish 
I had scored the touchdown, but I’ll take the 
58 yards. You know, what I wasn’t gonna do is 
fumble. After those turnovers in the first half, 
there was no chance I was gonna give the ball 
up on that play. I’ll get caught, which, between 
friends and family, I still get a little grief for.
Five plays later, Michigan running back Sam 
McGuffie plunged into the endzone for a three-
yard touchdown. The Wolverines led, 27-19. Two 
possessions later, Wisconsin took over with 1:19 
left and started driving…
Nessler: Two receivers to the right, he’s 
looking that way, throwing that way and it is 
caught! Touchdown!
The Badgers scored with 13 seconds left and 
had to go for a two-point conversion.
Threet: I was down there towards the end of 
the coaches box with my towel, trying to get 
the crowd as loud as I could. Michael Phelps 
was on the sideline with us — he was like an 
honorary captain that game.
Nessler: Wisconsin’s gotta have two. Evridge 
looks and throws and it’s caught! Travis 
Beckum! There’s a flag!
Thompson: I saw the flag when it happened. 
I was on the field. But I didn’t know, I was just 
playing. And then I was like, ‘Okay we’ve got 
to line up and go do it again.’
The penalty was an ineligible man downfield 

call against tight end Travis Beckum, who 
caught the pass. Wisconsin moved five yards 
back and tried again.
Nessler: Wisconsin to try to tie it up. Evridge 
steps up, throws high! Incomplete!
Threet: At that point in time, in my mind, it 
didn’t matter if it was regulation or overtime, 
we had too much energy and positive motion, 
that whether the defense came up like they 
did on that second two-point conversion 
try or whether we had to go out there for 
overtime, there was no doubt in my mind at 
that point.
Thompson: We felt like we were gonna play 
until there was no time on the clock. But if we 
had to go to overtime, we were ready to go.
Pleasant: Don’t let them fool you, every 
person in fucking Michigan Stadium was 
sitting on the edge of their seat. They had 
come back, and we drove it down the field. 
We literally drove the ball down the field. … 
It’s not like they came back and then they just 
punished us. That’s what made us feel so bad, 
because we were doing well, then they came 
back and we finally get it to the limit and then 
we just couldn’t.
Deandre Levy, Wisconsin linebacker, 2005-
2008, in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: It 
was embarrassing. I didn’t know how to react. 
I couldn’t believe this was happening, how we 
basically gave the game away in the second 
half.
Snyder: I think everyone felt that that could 
be the kickstarter for something, because no 
one in the Michigan fanbase or the Michigan 

community or whatever had ever gone 
through the other side of it. They had never 
experienced a team that just totally fell apart. 
… They didn’t think that it would be the only 
highlight for the whole season.
Pleasant: That was a hurtful game, man, 
because we lost that game, and we ended up 
coming to Michigan State that same year, and 
ended up losing in a very similar fashion. That 
was a tough year. We came into that year with 
high hopes.
... I mean, it was very obvious that it wasn’t 
the same Michigan. You have to take into 
consideration, that when I was leaving high 
school, if you weren’t a top recruit in the 
nation, you weren’t even getting a look from 
Michigan. I mean, let’s just be real. … I don’t 
know what those fuckin’ Michigan guys were 
telling you, but don’t let this shit fool you. 
There was a huge difference. I mean, it wasn’t 
even the same program.
Thompson: (The interception) is up top. 
It’s definitely up top. I had things that I had 
done in my career that I felt like was a good 
thing, but it didn’t go to show for what that 
did. I had a fun career at Michigan, but it’s 
definitely up top as one of the top highlights of 
my career.
Koger: It was probably more of just a bright 
spot, of just that season and my career. It’s 
one of those games, when people ask about, 
you bring up because it was such a huge 
comeback at such a pivotal time of the season. 
Just reflecting on that season, we weren’t very 
good. We didn’t win a lot of games. But there’s 

always positives to every situation.
Threet: I lived in New York for six years, 
so any time I’m at anywhere watching a 
Michigan game and something comes up, 
that’s the first memory, is the 58-yard run 
against top-10 Wisconsin.
Pleasant was hired as a graduate assistant for 
the Wolverines in 2012, Koger’s senior season.
Pleasant: When I was coaching there, they 
would ask, like, ‘Were you in that game?’ 
And I was like, ‘Yeah, I was in that game.’ 
And they’re like, ‘Aw man, that was crazy. 
You remember when they were booing us? 
Remember trying to get this thing going here 
or there?’ Yeah, no doubt, it was (brought up). 
It was.
But at that time, Michigan was still trying 
to find itself. They were trying to find their 
brand. They were trying to figure out who 
they were, offensively and defensively. And 
that’s the thing that we were joking about at 
that time. Because you have to imagine, for 
me being at Michigan, and for me being able 
to be reflective to them, they really didn’t talk 
much smack, because Rich Rod wasn’t very 
successful.
Threet: I don’t think any of the things I 
remember I want to forget. I think of it as 
wins and learns, not wins and losses. You 
know, regardless of what situation. Biggest 
thing I remember from the Wisconsin game 
are the boos at halftime and the cheers at the 
end.

Breakdown: ‘M’ vs. Wisconsin

By MARK CALCAGNO 

Daily Sports Editor

Here it is.
After 
four 
blowout 
wins 
and 
one 
furious 
comeback 
in 
Evanston, 
the 
Michigan 
football team finally has its 
chance 
at 
another 
ranked 
opponent. The Wolverines’ last 
shot, of course, ended with a 
loss to Notre Dame to open 
their season.
But since then, Michigan’s 
offense has added dynamism 
thanks to needed improvement 
on its line. Junior quarterback 
Shea Patterson has been kept 
heathy and mostly upright, 
allowing 
him 
to 
throw 
10 
touchdowns with a completion 
percentage 
approaching 
70 
percent.
Those numbers make the 
Wolverines’ next three games 
— 
Saturday’s 
contest 
with 
Wisconsin, next week’s game at 
Michigan State and then home 
against Penn State — seem more 
winnable than they did directly 
after the loss in South Bend.
The 
Badgers, 
however, 
have the best rushing attack 
Michigan 
will 
face 
in 
the 
regular season, along with a 
proven quarterback in Alex 
Hornibrook. The teams’ last 
meeting went Wisconsin’s way, 
24-10, last November.
The Wolverines have the 
chance to avenge that loss 
and earn a marquee win this 
weekend. 
Here’s 
how 
the 
Badgers and Michigan match 
up.

Michigan pass offense vs. 
Wisconsin’s pass defense

Nebraska 
threw 
for 
407 
yards against the Badgers last 
Saturday — two weeks after 
mustering just 93 yards through 
the air against the Wolverines. 
Wisconsin 
struggled 
with 
the mobility of Cornhuskers 
quarterback Adrian Martinez, 
who was also dangerous hitting 
receivers with consistent time 
in the pocket. 
Perpetuating the Badgers’ 
difficulties 
are 
four 
key 
injuries to their secondary. 
Safety 
D’Cota 
Dixon 
said 
he’ll play despite being listed 
as 
questionable 
while 
his 
counterpart, Scott Nelson, will 
miss the first half after being 
ejected from last week’s game. 

Caesar Williams and Deron 
Harrell — Wisconsin’s starting 
corners — are also questionable.
Patterson made play after 
play last week in Michigan’s 
victory over Maryland, and 
with Wisconsin’s injuries, he 
could do more of the same 
against the Badgers.

Edge: Michigan

Michigan rush offense vs. 
Wisconsin’s rush defense

Wisconsin’s 
bad 
luck 
worsened Thursday morning 
with the news that defensive 
end Isaiahh Loudermilk will 
not make the trip to Ann Arbor. 
Loudermilk is the team’s best 
pass rusher and a crucial part of 
its run defense, which is ranked 

fifth in the Big Ten and allows 
130.2 yards per game.
On the other side, running 
backs 
coach 
Jay 
Harbaugh 
said on Wednesday that he 
“expects” Chris Evans to play. 
The junior running back went 
through warmups last week 
,but ultimately sat out his third 
consecutive game.
Senior running back Karan 
Higdon has carried the ship in 
Evans’ absence with 30 and 25 
carries for 115 and 103 yards, 
respectively, 
the 
past 
two 
games. Despite the Badgers’ 
sturdy front, Higdon should 
get another heavy workload 
Saturday with Michigan’s run-
first style. 
Last week, redshirt junior 
left tackle Jon Runyan said 
his 
group 
has 
room 
for 

improvement in run blocking, 
and this week would be the 
perfect time to make that jump.

Edge: Toss-up

Michigan pass defense vs. 
Wisconsin pass offense

Wisconsin quarterback Alex 
Hornibrook has been stellar 
on the road, throwing for 18 
touchdowns 
and 
just 
three 
interceptions his past 10 games. 
Hornibrook 
wasn’t 
fantastic 
in last season’s meeting — 
9-of-19 for 143 yards — but he 
made trademark tight-window 
throws to hurt the Wolverines 
in 
key 
moments. 
Michigan 
allows just 134 yards per game 
through the air, but penalties 
have 
somewhat 
offset 
that 

low mark. If the Wolverines 
can apply pressure and get 
to 
Hornibrook 
on 
multiple 
occasions, it’ll pay dividends 
for their pass defense.

Edge: Michigan 

 Michigan run defense vs. 
Wisconsin’s run offense

It’s power football at its finest: 
the country’s third-ranked run 
defense against its third-ranked 
rusher, Jonathan Taylor.

AARON BAKER/Daily
Junior quarterback Shea Patterson has thrown 10 touchdowns so far this season, almost reaching a completion percentage of 70 percent through six games.s

Michigan 
survived 
the 
Terrapins’ tricky, jet sweep-
filled run game, but as secondary 
coach Michael Zordich explained 
Wednesday, the Badgers are a 
different animal.
“These guys, they’re gonna 
hit and go north and south,” 
Zordich said. “For our corners 
and the safeties on the edges, 
they gotta fill the lanes. So it’s 
gonna be more of a challenge, 
big-time.
“They’ll get in these sets, it’s 
like rugby. These formations, 
everybody’s in there real tight, 
they’ll run the ball, run the ball, 

run the ball, run the ball.”
Taylor rushed for 221 yards 
last week, and even against a 
top-ranked defense, he can turn 
in stat-stuffing efforts behind 
the country’s best offensive line.

Edge: Wisconsin

Special Teams

Michigan’s 
stretch 
of 
dominance on special teams 
ended 
last 
week. 
After 
a 
Wolverine field goal, Maryland 
grabbed a 7-3 lead off a 98-yard 
touchdown return.

Elsewhere, this is a game 
with two competent kickers 
— a rarity in college football. 
Redshirt 
sophomore 
Quinn 
Nordin is up to 8-of-9 on field 
goal attempts this season, as his 
leg seemingly grows stronger by 
the week. The Badgers’ Rafael 
Gaglianone, meanwhile, is one 
conversion away from setting 
the school record at Wisconsin.
It’ll come down to which unit 
can perform when pressure 
comes Saturday.

Edge: Toss-up

Intangibles:

Since the Big Ten signed its 
TV deal with FOX, night games 
at 
Michigan 
Stadium 
have 
become less of a novelty — the 
Wolverines were required to 
play at least three split between 
2017 and 2018. Michigan played 
under the lights twice last 
season, losing to Michigan State 
before routing Minnesota on a 
cold November evening.

Edge: Michigan, by virtue of 
the sports-writing convention 
of playing at home

Bottom Line

The Wolverines have come 
out of the gates flat against their 
two best opponents this season, 
Notre Dame and Northwestern. 
If they can avoid doing the same 
while generating some longer 
passing plays Saturday, it’s a 
winnable game for Michigan.

Prediction: 
Michigan 
24, 
Wisconsin 20

AMELIA CACCHIONE/Daily
Sophomore running back Jonathan Taylor is an offensive threat for the Badgers, and has currently rushed for 849 of Wisconsin’s 1,435 total yards throughout 5 games so far during the 2018 season.

What to Watch For: Wisconsin

By MAX MARCOVITCH 

Daily Sports Editor

Seeking 
copious 
amounts 
of 
unnecessary 
stress 
with 
potential 
for 
gut-wrenching 
twists and turns?
Boy, do I have the Saturday 
evening activity for you.
No. 15 Wisconsin comes to 
Michigan Stadium to face off 
against No. 12 Michigan, in the 
first leg of a season-defining 
three-game 
stretch 
for 
the 
Wolverines. Chances are, your 
opinion 
of 
this 
Wolverines 
team will change drastically 
by Sunday morning, one way or 
another. 
Michigan’s goals all remain 
on the table. But in order to 
maintain hopes of a Big Ten 
Championship, 
it 
must 
win 
two of the next three games at 
minimum. All three, and you can 
start to sniff a College Football 
Playoff appearance.
One step at a time, though.
The Badgers — a Big Ten 
contender in their own right — 
will pose a proper litmus test for 
just how far the Wolverines have 
come since the opening-week 
loss to Notre Dame. Here’s what 
you should be watching for in 
the high-stakes affair:

Who plays, who doesn’t and 
how it affects the run defense 

Simple enough, right? But this 
could well be the difference.
Slowing 
down 
Badgers 
running back Jonathan Taylor 
and 
the 
vaunted 
Wisconsin 
rushing attack is a chore on its 
own. Taylor has rushed for 849 
of the Badgers’ 1,435 rushing 
yards on the season. Taylor is 
ranked third nationally in that 
category, and Wisconsin ranks 
fourth — behind three triple-
option offenses.
The Badgers run the ball nearly 
twice as often as they throw it; 
there’s no mystery about what 
Wisconsin wants to do. Slowing 
them down becomes infinitely 
more difficult if Michigan is 
missing key contributors on the 
defensive line. 
There is little clarity on 
whether junior Rashan Gary 
(AC 
joint), 
junior 
Michael 
Dwumfour 
(leg), 
sophomore 
Aubrey Solomon (knee) or junior 
Carlo Kemp will be able to aid 
that effort on the field.
For the most part, mum’s the 

word, though Solomon’s mother 
posted a photo on Twitter of 
Solomon after practice — in 
which he participated. Solomon 
hasn’t played since the game 
against the Fighting Irish.
Purely speculative, it seems 
like it would take a substantial 
injury to keep Gary out of this 
one. 
Harbaugh 
hinted 
after 
last week’s game that he held 
Gary out in Michigan’s game 
with Maryland against Gary’s 
preference. If he does play, it’s 
worth monitoring how effective 
he’ll be at a level that will 
almost certainly be less than 100 
percent. Gary’s presence alone 
will help draw attention, but 
mere “presence” only goes so far.
Regardless of the status of 
those 
aforementioned, 
this 
will be a big game for fifth-
year seniors Bryan Mone and 
Lawrence Marshall, both of 
whom have taken circuitous 
routes back into the defensive 
tackle rotation. Both will be 
counted on to hold their ground 
against 
Wisconsin’s 
mauling 
offensive line. 
This might be the biggest 
game of their seasons (careers?), 
individually.
Can 
Michigan 
shut 
down 
Taylor 
and 
Wisconsin’s 
run 
game? 
That 
seems 
highly 
unlikely. But the Wolverines — 
with the nation’s sixth-ranked 
rush defense — can absolutely 
slow it down. And if they do, 
it’s not hard to envision this 
ending in a victory, maybe even 
a comfortable one. 

But, that’s a big if.

How far has this offense 
come since Notre Dame?

This 
entire 
article 
could 
be summarized in that one 
sentence: How far has this team 
come?
The 
signs 
have 
been 
encouraging on many levels from 
what appears to be an improving 
team. But with that progress 
coming against five opponents 
with inferior talent, it will be 
impossible to know just how far 
the Wolverines have come until 
they step on the field Saturday 
night.
Against the Fighting Irish, 
Michigan’s 
offense 
mustered 
just three points until late in the 
fourth quarter while scrambling 
to mount a comeback. Since 
that 
game, 
the 
Wolverines 
have averaged 42.4 points per 
contest. For the first time since 
Sept. 1, though, they will face 
a unit comparable to the Notre 
Dame defense that controlled 
the game.
How far has the offensive line 
come? Can the young receivers 
gain 
separation 
consistently? 
Will the tight ends continue to 
be weapons? Can they convert 
red 
zone 
appearances 
into 
touchdowns?
Let’s find out.

Can 
they 
control 
the 
emotions at night?

I know what you’re thinking. I 

can see your eyes rolling.
I, too, generally hate sports 
clichés like this one. But it’s 
a reality that several players 
addressed 
this 
week: 
Night 
games — especially at home, 
with College Gameday in town 
— are different, and thus require 
different preparation.
“Big stage, some people get a 
little bit too energetic, or some 
people get a little bit too down,” 
said junior safety Josh Metellus. 
“They don’t want to mess up.”
This is just the sixth night 
game 
in 
Michigan 
Stadium 
history. The crowd will be 
amped.
Often 
those 
heightened 
emotions only last for the early 
portion of the game before 
tapering off. But twice now, 
Michigan 
has 
trailed 
by 
a 
large deficit early, tasked with 
climbing back into the game. 
Against Notre Dame at night, 
the Wolverines trailed, 21-3, 
before anyone could catch their 
breath.
At Northwestern, Michigan 
was ultimately able to overcome 
a quick 17-0 deficit, scoring 20 
unanswered points.
If a similar start ensues 
Saturday, though, it would be 
tough to imagine the Wolverines 
mounting 
a 
large 
comeback 
against a sound Wisconsin team. 
Keeping emotions in check will 
play a big role in how the game 
starts.

Shea Patterson, here’s your 
moment

At the risk of hyperbole, this 
stretch coming up is why Shea 
Patterson came to Michigan. 
He’s been vocal about playing 
in — and winning — big games. 
Here’s his shot under the lights 
at Michigan Stadium.
In the 2016 matchup, Wilton 
Speight completed a 46-yard 
pass to Amara Darboh with 
7:56 left to take a 14-7 lead. 
The Wolverines beat then-No. 
8 Wisconsin by that same score 
(with an assist from Jourdan 
Lewis’ right arm). It’s hardly 
implausible 
to 
imagine 
this 
year’s version coming down 
to a similar situation. And if it 
does, Patterson has given fans 
no reason to doubt he’ll come 
through.
He’s on pace for over 2,500 
passing yards, 26 touchdowns 
and a 68.8 completion percentage 
over a 13-game season; the 
junior quarterback is arguably 
in the midst of the best season 
by a Michigan quarterback since 
Denard Robinson was under 
center.
But 
fairly 
or 
otherwise, 
Patterson will ultimately be 
judged by how he plays in — and 
whether he wins — these big 
games. He’d be the first to tell 
you that.

Prediction: 23-20, Michigan
