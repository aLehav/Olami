The University's acquisition

tiated in December will be com-
pleted next month.
At Thursday's Board of Re-

diligence period - which ensures
that the site complies with state
and federal regulations - ends on
May 18.
Consultants hired by the Uni-
versity to assess the site briefed
the regents on the condition of
the land at the site. The con-

they used methods approved by
American Society Testing Mate-

Teeing off for Mott's Children's Hospital

Third annual charity
event raises $650,000
By RYAN KARTJE
Managing Sports Editor
Under the leadership of former
Michigan football players Brian
Griese and Steve Hutchinson, the
Champions for Children's Hearts
Celebrity Golf Tournament enjoyed
a very successful third year.
The duo sought to continue the
philanthropic trend initiatedby for-
mer football coach Gary Moeller in
1990. Moeller would take his players
on weekly visits to Mott's Children's
Hospital to brighten the lives of
sick children through the From the
Heart Program.
Originally slated as a gala event
and a reunion for members of the
1997 National Championship foot-
ball team, the event has expanded
to become one of the football pro-
gram's largest fundraisers and
includes members of the 1997 team
as well as current NFL players and
past Michigan greats.
The annual event includes a kick-

off dinner gala at Crisler Arena
which served 500 guests, followed
by the golf tournament the next day.
In its first two years, the-golf out-
ing and gala event raised more than
$650,000.
After the event's first two impres-
sive years, Griese was thrilled to see
this year's event continue its suc-
cessful run with an expanded guest
list of former athletes and over
$120,000 raised at the gala alone. By
the end of the golf tournament, the
donations totaled $650,000.
"Part of beinga Michigan man is
doing community service and giv-
ing back," Griese said. "And Mott
Hospital is a great way to do it. ... It
means a lot to (Hutchinson and I)
because it was a part of our experi-
ence as student athletes."
In addition to support from
Michigan athletes and coaches, the
fundraiser has had continuing sup-
port from sponsors Lexus of Ann
Arbor and Delta Airlines, which
have both continued to aid Griese
and Hutchinson in the execution of
such a large fundraising venture.
Much of the fundraising at the
event will go toward the construe-

tion of the new Mott Hospital,
which is expected to cost an esti-
mated $523 million and is scheduled
to open in 2011. The rest of the fund-
raising will go toward the Michigan
Congenital Heart Center and the
Samara Mendu Fellowship Fund for
pediatric cardiology and pediatric
cardiac surgery.
Niether Griese nor former Heis-
man trophy winner Charles Wood-
son were surprised that contributors
made this year's event the most
successful of all, despite the recent
downturn in the economy.
"To raise so much money with
what's going on right now is amaz-
ing," Woodson said. "What that tells
you is that this cause is important.
When you can help someone out
who's hurting, especially a child, I
think most people would give their
last dime for something like that."
Woodson's contribution to this
year's event inspired Griese and
Hutchinson to invite him to become
the third leg of the fundraising
event next year- something Wood-
son said was "just duty calling."
"When Brian asked me, I had no
hesitation," Woodson said. "Wheth-

er it's doctors, aspiring doctors or
researchers, it's important that they
have whatever they need to facili-
tate to patients. Those patients need
all the care in the world, and what
the doctors need is funding.
"It's important for us to be
involved and get this money raised
so maybe sometime in the future we
find that cure."
During the tenure of former foot-
ball coach Lloyd Carr, the athletic
department began to increase its
role in fundraising ventures, and
current coach Rich Rodriguez, who
was a coach at West Virginia Uni-
versity at the time, took notice.
So when he came to the Univer-
sity, Rodriguez felt that continuing
the overwhelming support for fund-
raising, especially for Mott hospital,
was an important part of his student-
athletes' experience at Michigan.
"In our profession, I think it's
part of your job, but I don't think
that's the reason you do it," Rodri-
guez said. "You want to give back to
the community and the people who
mean so much to our area ... and I
don't know if there's a better cause
you can contribute to."

Clinical studies see applicant increase

Some want to help,
others want the
economic benefit
By ROGER SAUERHAFT
For the Daily
In the past year, the number of
students registered for University
of Michigan Health System clini-
cal studies: has increased twofold
- from just 1,500 last year to over
3,000 currently - and the princi-
pal reason behind the increase is in
debate.
Feedback from University faculty
of the Michigan Institute of Clinical
& Health Research and from stu-
dents reveals two main reasons for
the increase: the unselfish desire to
benefit others and monetary com-
pensation.
According to Ana Austin, assis-
tant managing director of MICHR,
the increased participation in clini-
cal studies has more to do with
mounting efforts to reach out to the
community than with the economic
downturn.
The number of registered stu-

dents is taken from the estimated
430 studies that are registered on
an online bulletin board through
MICHR, according to Austin. Over-
all, there are over 3,000 active clini-
cal studies in UMHS itself.
"We've gone to health fairs, we've
done outreach campaigns in the
media and we've passed things out,"
Austin said. "We've done a lot pro-
actively to get the word out for all
kinds of studies - ones with finan-
cial incentives and ones without."
But, registering does not nec-
essarily imply participation - it
merely means the individuals have
made themselves available for the
surveys. The conductors of each
study are responsible for choosing
participants for their surveys.
Austin also said that while people
participate for many reasons, the
MICHR institutional review board
discourages doing so for purely
financial reasons.
At the same time, Austin said that
she thinks people are more likely to
participate in studies to improve
others' welfare and to have a per-
sonal stake in a particular area of
research than to reap any economic
benefit.

"Financial compensation is not
considered a benefit of participat-
ing," Austin said. "It's really just
there to fairly compensate people
for their time, because we recog-
nize that often people have to drive
to the study site, they have to park,
and they have to take time away
from their job."
"(The review board) looks at the
compensation to make sure it isn't
too low, so people won't be unduly
burdened, but not too high so peo-
ple won't be tempted to participate
in something that isn't right for
them."
Austin said that during diffi-
cult financial times, people tend to
look for new ways to pay the bills,
which may have been a factor in the
increase of applicants. But Austin
added that the primary reason for
the rise was increased advertising.
Austin says that a key part of the
role of MICHR in these studies is
finding the right participants for
each given survey.
"People take part for a lot of dif-
ferent reasons, including altruis-
tic reasons," Austin said. "They
might have a disease or condition,
and they might want to make sure

future patients can have better
treatments. They want to partici-
pate in some way to advance science
in that field."
She also emphasized that money
is not as significant of a motivating
factor as it may seem.
"We've made a big effort to reach
out to the community to let them
now about opportunities to partici-
pate," Austin said. "So I don't think
it would be accurate to say that (the
increase) is something that has hap-
pened simply because of the econo-
my."
LSA sophomore Arik Alfi agreed
that financial incentive during the
economic downturn was not the
deciding factor behind his partici-
pation in clinical studies, none of
which were done within UMHS.
Instead, he participated in experi-
ments mostly in the field of econom-
ics. Alfi credited the opportunity to
help conduct advanced research as
the reason he first considered par-
ticipating but added that the money,
paid in cash, didn't hurt either.
In one University study, partici-
pants were guaranteed $5 per hour,
but averaged closer to $15 per hour.
Alfi remembered one study where

he made $40 in approximately an
hour. In another, he was given $30
after searching on Google for an
hour and a half.
Such high compensation is what
led others, like Nursing sophomore
Jillian Traskos, to participate in
clinical studies.
"I practically collect clinical
surveys!" Traskos wrote in e-mail
interview. "Personally, I love the
surveys because I get a little extra
cash without having to go through
the process of job hunting, inter-
views, training.... Paymentgeneral-
ly comes to more than eight dollars
an hour, which really adds up for a
college student who doesn't have
time for a real job."
Traskos, who felt the rise in par-
ticipant interest was directly related
to the economy, also noted that she
picks and chooses which surveys
interest her the most and which fit
her schedule the best. Traskos cited
financial incentive as her first prior-
ity.
Furthermore, Traskos wrote that
as a result of participating in sur-
veys, she has learned a fair amount
about psychology, sociology, busi-
ness management and UMHS.

Great(er) Lakes,
Regions should lead Great Lakes cleanup
The Great' Lakes may finally see some
of the restoration they require. After
months in a congressional committee,
President Barack Obama's Great Lakes Restora-
tion Initiative, which requests millions of dollars
for the protection and restoration of the lakes,
is under consideration in Congress. Because the
lakes support most of the region, it's imperative
that they be nurtured. Congress should pass this
initiative and ensure that the budget is allocated
to the regional authorities who best understand

Housing hassle
Regents should improve transparency of rate increase decisions

The University raising the cost of room and
board is nothing new. Neither is the Board of
Regents approving the increases without public
discussion. Despite students' economic concerns,
this year is no different.
On May 14, the Regents passed a 3.9-percent
increase in room and board rates for the 2009-
2010 school year but provided little information
as to the necessity of the increase. Without this
information, it's difficult for students to under-
stand why their room and board rates continue to
rise egregiously. The regents should make the pro-
cess by which it decides upon rate increases more
transparent and work to invite student input.
The hike in room and board rates consists of
a 1.9-percent increase to cover the rising cost of
operating expenses and a 2-percent increase for
Residential Life Initiatives. The Residential Life
Initiatives pays for the maintenence and repair of
the residence halls, keeping them in good shape
for current and future students. The increase
means the price of a standard double in the resi-
dence halls will cost more than $9,000 in most
residence halls - $334 more expensive next year
than it was last year.
This is too high of a cost for students. Many pay
their own room and board or take out loans to
cover the cost. Should the University continue to
raise the rent, it could easily price many students
out of the residence halls. In the current econom-
ic climate, the University should be taking steps
to make college more affordable - and that must
extend to housing costs as well.

But the repercussions are more far-reaching
than the economic impact on individual students.
The residence halls should be home to a socioeco-
nomically diverse group of students. When the
halls become more expensive, they are no lon-
ger viable options for less wealthy students. As
these students are forced to choose inexpensive
private housing, there is less interaction between
students from different economic backgrounds.
This causes de facto segregation on a campus
that should instead promote the integration of
students with different backgrounds.
What makes the situation even worse is that stu-
dents don't even know if these costs are necessary.
The vague description of the Residential Life Ini-
tiatives provides little explanation. And any debate
or discussion the regents may have had on the
rates took place behind closed doors. In their pub-
lic meeting, they approved the rate increase unani-
mously, without any real public hearing or even
debate amongst themselves. But the University's
continued resistance to givingstudents a chance to
express their opinions combined with the regents'
lack of discussion makes it obvious that the Univer-
sity doesn't care about students' concerns.
The Regents weren't taking student con-
cerns into account when it passed a 3.9-percent
increase in room and board rates last week. For
students, too much rides on the cost of room and
board for them to be denied the knowledge of
what the regents take into account when approv-
ing rate increases. More importantly, students
need the ability to comment on it.

how to spend it.
Obama's 2010 fiscal budget
asked for $475 million to be
allocated to the Great Lakes
Restoration Initiative. This
amount would push annual fed-
eral spending on the Great Lakes
past $1 billion. The initiative
targets the restoration of coast-
lines, protection ofwildlife and
elimination of contaminants. To
ensure that these objectives are
met, $65 million has been ear-
marked for evaluating and mon-
itoring the initiative's progress.
If Congress approves this bill,
its ecological benefits would
be substantial. According to
the Environmental Protection
Agency, the current level of
phosphorous and algae blooms
in the Great Lakes is danger-
ously high, which negatively
impacts wildlife and reduces
water supply. These pollutants
are among those targeted by the
bill's restoration efforts.
The Great Lakes are worth
this fight because economic
improvements are greatly influ-
enced by ecological conditions.

The industries based around the
Great Lakes, such as transporta-
tion, communications and trade,
are the backbone of the regional
economies and depend upon the
condition of the lakes. For exam-
ple, tourism - a major source of
income for Michigan - would
increase as a result of restoring
the lakes and would help to revi-
talize local economies.
And because it's local econo-
mies that feel the most direct
impact of the state of the Great
Lakes, this issue should be put
in the hands of the Great Lakes
states rather than the federal
government. Local agencies
have a better idea of what needs
to be done and how to effectively
do it than the more removed and
less directly dependent federal
government.
The Great Lakes have been
neglected for too long. To pro-
tect this environmental and eco-
nomic resource, Congress needs
to pass this initiative swiftly so
the regional governments can
get to work.

BRITTANY SMITH I
Reviving Detroit's economy

With Detroit suffering from a
slumping economy, challenging
issues have thrust the city under
a microscope, open to all for judg-
ment, speculation and ridicule.
Among its current problems,
there have been scandals involv-
ing corrupt politicians, some of
whom are suspected of politick-
ing at the expense of taxpayers.
The Detroit Public School Dis-
trict has been victimized by dras-
tic budget cuts that will cause 29
schools to close at the end of this
school year. Unemployment rates
have skyrocketed. But what I find
t be one of the most interest-
ing causes of Detroit's economic
instability is the phenomenon
called "white flight."
When Detroit was a booming
industrial city in the early- and
mid-1900s, its revenue cane from
the white upper and middle class-
es. In the mid-1900s, white flight
- during which the city's white
population drastically decreased
due to the arrival of blacks in

predominantly white areas -
changed this booming industrial
city. Consequently, the city's rev-
enue became largely dependent
on the black middle class. Now
that Detroit's black middle class
is moving out, the city's revenue
base is suffering. When a city's
population decreases, the tax base
shrinks.Yet, despitethe decreased
income, itstill attempted to main-
tain the same level of operation
instead of adjusting its budget to
reflect the loss of revenue.
To solve some of Detroit's
problems, local and state policy-
makers must have honest con-
versations. Though many may
disagree, I think it's in Detroit
policymakers' best interest to
involve the state in the regent-
rification process of this city. If
Detroit sees that one strategy
doesn't work, changes must be
made so that strong, resourceful
alliances can be sought.
To make the improvements
the city needs, old ideas must be

replaced with new ideas. The
city must find optimistic leaders
with fresh ideas and the capac-
ity to restore Detroit's potential,
maintain an informed citizenship
and call for educational reform
that will enable Detroit's youth.
Through this education reform,
Detroit will be investing in the
promise of its youth to create a
better tomorrow for their city.
Educating the youth of Detroit
will lead to a more stable future.
In addition, Detroit must create a
promising industry to attract the
brightest and best leadership to
stay, live and thrive in this city.
The million dollar question, of
course, is if Detroit will bounce
back and stabilize its economy
by providing its citizens with job
security and attract interest to
repopulate the city or continue to
struggle.

Government blackmail

During last year's presi-
dential election, I wasn't
really interested in who
wouldwin. Both
of the major
candidates K
simply didn't j
offer me many>
opinions that
I agreed with.
But despite my
apathy, I have to PATRICK
admit that I felt ZABAWA
a little secure
when Barack
Obama won the
election. Sure I disagreed with
him on almost everything, but he
at least seemed to be an honest
candidate concerned for the aver-
age American's plight.
Though I went into it hoping for
the best, Obama's presidency thus
far has made me trust government
evenless --andmy trustwasn'tvery
high to begin with. What killed the
small amount of trust I had was
something his administration did
within the first couple months of
his presidency. It supposedly used
blackmail to ensure its success in
negotiations with Chrysler's lend-
ers, reminding me that government
is something to fear, not to trust.
It has been alleged that the
Obama administration used
threats to protect the interests
of the automaker Chrysler LLC,
which - along with General
Motors - is now government-sup-
ported. With the horrible state of
their finances, the Obama admin-
istration made it clear that many
of those associated with the com-
panies - stockholders, employees,
lenders, etc. - would have to make
sacrifices. But when the outcome
of negotiations between Chrysler
and its lenders wasn't looking good
for Chrysler, the administration
supposedly blackmailed a lender,
Perella Weinberg Partners, to give
in to Chysler's offer. According to
Perella Weinberg's lawyer Tom

Lauria, who spoke on the Frank
Beckmann Radio Show, the White
House told Perella Weinberg to
agree to the offer or "the full force
of the White House press corps
would destroy its reputation."
The different parties suppos-
edly involved in this blackmail all
refute Lauria's claim. The Obama
administration denies it outright.
Strangely enough, Perella Wein-
berg Partners also denies the
claim. But Lauria hasn't backed
down from his statement despite
all the claims to the contrary. If the
Obama administration is indeed
the guilty party, it has threatened
a private firm in a very scary man-
ner. But it also wouldn't have been
the first administration to do so. In
fact, the Bush administration used
blackmail and admitted to it.
In December, Bank of America's
chief financial officer told chief
executive officer Kenneth Lewis
that Merrill Lynch, the firm the
bank was going to purchase on
Jan. 1, had suffered severe and
not-yet-disclosed losses. Lewis
became wary of the purchase, but
Bush's Treasury Secretary Henry
Paulson was so concerned that
canceling the purchase would
further escalate the financial cri-
sis that he blackmailed Lewis
into completing it. Should Bank
of America have backed out of the
purchase, Paulson told Lewis, his
job and those of his company's
board would have been at risk. At
the same time, he told Lewis not
to tell stockholders of the loss, an
order that went against federal
law. Both Lewis and Paulson cor-
roborated this story to New York
Attorney General Andrew Cuomo,
who urged federal authorities to
investigate the pressure Paulson
put on Lewis and his board to com-
mit this possibly-illegal action.
Authorities have not yet acted on
Cuomo's recommendation.
Paulson was, of course, inter-
ested in protecting the financial

markets by blackmailing Lewis
and Bank of America's board. But
what's scary to me is that this
blackmail encouraged Lewis to
break federal laws that the gov-
ernment is responsible for enforc-
ing. The Obama administration's
blackmail of Perella Weinberg,
if it happened, is the same situ-
ation - an administration ceas-
ing to defend a business contract
between Chrylser and Perella
Weinberg that it has the responsi-
bility to protect.
The government
should protect,
not oppress.
What the government is doing
in these situations is acting like a
private company - albeit one that
doesn't even have to follow its own
regulations. Itis actinginthe inter-
est of the corporations it supports
(Bank of America and Chrysler)
and threatening those who get in
the way of their expansion. Usu-
ally those who have business con-
tracts with corporations, such as
their lenders and stockholders,
have governmental agencies that
protect them from any breach
of contract the corporation may
attempt. But when the governmen-
tal agencies assigned to protect
these stockholders and lenders
have instead turned against them,
as in these two cases, government
becomes worse than any malicious
corporation - it becomes an unpo-
liced oppressor free to bring about
whatever havoc it wants. If the
government ceases to enforce its
own laws and becomes the source
of the harm itself, what is the pur-
pose of government?

familiar with the infa-
mous "MIP."
But it wasn't
until I came to
the University
that I actually
saw it in action.
That's not to say
that every time -
I go out at night, MATTHEW
I see cops writ-GREEN
ing tickets to
hapless under-
graduates. The
vast majority ofUniversitystudents
who choose to drink manage to do
so without legal repercussions.
But there is a palpable presence of
students at the University unlucky
enough to have been charged with
the unlawful possession of alcohol.
When I googled "minor in pos-
session," a link to the University
Housing website was the fourth
result on the list. Of all the col-
leges and universities that must
deal with similar alcohol-related
issues, it's curious that our uni-
versity apparently has the most to
say on the matter. That may sim-
ply be a condition of its location
in Michigan, though. On just the
first page of returns for the same
search, three links pertain to the
MIP policies in Michigan alone.
In addition, "Minor in Possession
Michigan" is one of the related
searches suggested at the bottom
of the page, while there is no such
suggestion for any other state.
At first, I thought that these
must only be the returns for people
physically in Michigan, and that
Google, in all its omniscience, must
have been tuning the search more
finely to my needs. So I called a
friend in New York to run the same
search. Our results were identical.
Why all this interest in the way
our lowly state punishes minors
who drink? It turns out that
Michigan is known for having the
strictest minor in possession laws
in the nation. Since 2004, blood
alcohol content has been used in
Michigan in defining "posses-
sion," in addition to physically
holding or storing alcohol. More-
over, the law enables the court to
issue jail time to a minor caught
twice in possession of alcohol.
All that seems a pretty excessive
punishment for actions that aren't
inherently amoral. Most Ameri-
cans are in favor of the current
drinking age, according to a recent
survey by the Gallup Organization.
But only a select few would argue
that there's anything truly uncon-

scionable about having a drink. It's
strange that the punishment for
drinking is so harsh.
A better alternative would be
something similar to Missouri's
policies. Missouri law allows par-
ents to distribute alcohol to their
children within reason. More
importantly, Missouri is one of 20
states that restrict only the sale
of alcohol to minors, not the con-
sumption. And while the MIP mis-
demeanor can be expunged after
a few years in Michigan, Missouri
law allows the charge to be entirely
erased if individuals have no other
charges against them.
The possibility ofexpungingthe
MIP charge at allshows that Mich-
igan is at least somewhat pragmat-
ic about this issue. The practice of
giving first offenders somewhat of
a break is reasonable. But the cur-
rent system in Michigan is flawed.
If a freshman gets carried away
Michigan's
strict MIP laws
are flawed.
during Welcome Week and winds
up with alcohol poisoning, his
friends are faced with a disincen-
tive to take him to the hospital.
If they were to dial 911, it would
mean getting their friend (and pos-
sibly themselves) into trouble. In
the unfortunate but quite possible
instance that such an individual
were not to have good - or even
decent - friends, the MIP law
would actually hurt the minor. In
fact, there was a recent initiative in
Michigan to protect minors in this
position, but the state legislature
failed to understand its importance
and did notpass it.
Whether or not drinking laws
are sensible or if it's ethical to let
an 18-year-old die in Afghanistan
without the right even to drink a
beer is an issue for another col-
umn. The fact is there is currently
a law prohibiting those younger
than 21 years of age from con-
suming alcohol and as such there
must be some sort of punishment
for violating that law. Otherwise,
the law may as well not exist. This
may be true, but the current poli-
cies take it too far, and in doing
so, they hurt the very people they
are trying to protect.

no abnormalities.
There was some minor land
contamination in a land parcel not
actively used by Pfizer, and the
company issued a voluntary clean
up. The University and Pfizer are
currently working with the Michi-
gan Department of Environmental
Quality to discuss the transaction
and how to correct it.
John Cameron, a member of
the Dickinson Wright PLLC law
firm who dealt with the real es-
tate transactions of the Pfizer ac-
quisition, said that Pfizer repre-
sentatives were very cooperative
throughout the due-diligence peri-
od and helped the University reach
its .goal of completing the transac-
tion in June.
"All along the road Pfizer folks
were very cooperative, were work-
ing toward the same goal that we
were working toward and had a
successful consummation in trans-
action, which we're going to have
in about a month."

ties each year.
"If you're going to pay people
and you're going to have increases
in your supplies, which you always
do, and in your food costs, which
you always do, then you have to
manage that some way or you re-
duce the quality, lower services for
students and lower food value for
students, which I don't think is a
good bet," she said. "We did a very
good job, I think, of balancing all
of those needs and coming up with
those increases"
Coleman added thatshe thought
the cost increase was reasonable in a
time when the most of the residence
halls are in need of infrastructure
renovation.
"I'm pretty comfortable with
(the room and board rate increase)
and I think we've done a very good
job with trying to manage costs at
a time when we're trying to update
some of our worst halls," Coleman
said. "We haven't done a lot in the
last 35 years, except for life safety,
and so I think students are going to
get a good value for their money."
The University recently com-
pleted the renovation of Mosher-
Jordan and the Hill Dining Center,
which cost approximately $65.1

According to Baier, the pur-
chase is expected to produce 2,000
to 3,000 jobs in the next decade.
Provost announces 200 faculty
promotions
University Provost Theresa
Sullivan announced 200 faculty
promotions from the instructional,
research and clinical tracks, which
she and academic reviewers from
various schools and colleges had
been reviewing since the fall.
The regents approved 149 cases
from the instructional track. Cases
from research and clinical tracks
are not approved by the regents.
Sullivan said that faculty pro-
motions "are one of the most im-
portant activities of the University"
every year because the decisions
that she and academic reviewers
make about promotions "shake the
University well into the future."
According to Sullivan, the se-
lection process begins every fall
when academic reviewers from
each school and college review
faculty members who are eligible
for promotion and/or tenure. The
million, and is underway with the
renovation of Stockwell, valued at
about $39.6 million. In addition,
the University is building North
Quad, located at South State Street
and East Washington Street, and
has approved plans to start the
renovation of Couzens Hall.
Coleman also said that the cost
increase will go into a financial aid
package for the cost of attendance
so that students who need financial
aid will be able to have room and
board as part of their entire cost of
attendance.
Residents of Northwood Com-
munity Apartments will pay an av-
erage increase of 1.9 percent more
than last year for monthly rent,
which represents an increase of
approximately $21 a month for an
unfurnished two bedroom unit, ac-
cording to Harper.
The 1.9-percent increase for
Northwood Community Apart-
ments covers the projected general
costs for maintaining the apart-
ments for the 2009-2010 academic
year.
University Housing developed
the room and board rate increases
for the 2009-2010 academic year in
collaboration with the Residence

schools and colleges then conduct
thorough and careful reviews of the
teaching and research of each can-
didate and make a decision about
recommending the faculty member
for tenure or promotion.
Schools and colleges also
gather reviews about candidates'
research from experts outside the
University.
Sullivan said that this was the
second year that the entire process
was handled electronically.
University spokeswoman Kel-
ly Cunningham said that it's too
soon to calculate how much the
approved promotions for this year
will cost.
Cunningham said that last year
the promotions cost about $1.9
million, and because this year's
number of approved promotions is
about the same, University officials
anticipate about the same cost.
Cunningham added that fac-

ulty promotions are a planned part
of the budget every year. Last year,
faculty promotions composed 22
percent of the general fund.
Regents approve building of
new soccer stadium
Regents also approved plans to
build a 26,000 square-foot soccer
stadium, estimated to cost about $6
million.
The stadium will be located
west of the Varsity Tennis Center
on South State Street at the site
of the three soccer fields added in
2008. Athletic department resourc-
es and gifts will fund the project.
According to a press release
issued at the meeting, the sta-
dium will add grandstand seating
for 2,200 people, two team locker
rooms, restrooms and concession
stands for spectators and a press
area.

Bill Martin, the director of in-
tercollegiate athletics, said in the
press release that "the goal is to
create a European-style stadium
with seating on both sides of the
field."
Martin also stated that some of
the seats could be covered depend-
ing on costs. Currently, the soc-
cer fields only provide temporary
bleachers for spectators.
Greg Ryan, the University
women's soccer coach, said in the
press release that the stadium will
"benefit our players, fans and will
play a key role in helping us recruit
future quality student-athletes as
we continue to rebuild the wom-
en's soccer program."
The Michigan architectural
firm Jickling Lyman Powell As-
sociates Inc. will design the sta-
dium and schematic drawings will
be presented at a future regents
meeting.

3RD GENERATION IPOD SHUFFLE

While the latest iteration of the iPod shuffle is
certainly the most prone to being left in your pants
pocket and meeting a spin-cycle demise, that's a
small risk to take for the cutest little MP3 player
you ever did see. So small you forget it's there, the
new four-gigabyte gadget - which holds approxi-
mately 1,000 songs - takes the music-on-the-go

only .4 ounces, the third generation shuffle hardly
seems big enough to be real. Many flash drives
of comparable size don't even have as much hard
drive space, not to mention their inability to simul-
taneously play music and make their owners look
like pretentious-yet-endearingly-cool hipsters.
And at such a light weight, many joggers - one of
the shuffle's main demographics - can listen with-
out being weighed down.

ANGELS
From Page 8
traced back to the book, in which
these seemingly perfunctory state-
ments are properly fleshed out and
actually make sense. "Angels" (like
"Da Vinci Code") screws itself by
splitting action and mystery, but not
fully developing either side. When
details are neglected, audiences are
left to go with the flow, which can be
extremely infuriating attimes. On the
other hand, if none of the interesting
and genuinely cool Catholic and Illu-
minati lore is present, the whole pur-
pose of the movie is lost.
The worst part of the film, though, is
that fans of the book gain nothing from
watching the movie. Not only does the
movie skip important information
present in the books, but the info it
does have is so watered down that all
significance is lost. The deaths in the
novel definitely churn the imagina-
tion. But when these scenes are shown
on the bigscreen under a PG-13 rating,
not much justice is done. That's not to
say a "Saw" approach is required, but
just like the dialogue of the film, they
feel merely obligatory - just some-
thing to move the story along.
Ultimately, "Angels" doesn't share
any of the intrigue or mystery of
its book counterpart. It's trite in its
descriptions and divided in its spirit.
Not even a trip to the confession booth
can purge the sin of watching this
abomination of a movie.

Pixar director discusses Up'coming film

Pete Docter reveals the
creative process behind the
newest Pixar installment
By ANDREW LAPIN
Daily Film Editor
When filmmaker Pete Docter ("Monsters,
Inc.") was trying to figure out an idea for his
next movie, a peculiar image started to float
around in his brain.
"I just drew this picture of a house float-
ing with balloons, and something about that
seemed very evocative," Docter explained in a
recent phone interview. "We started just think-
ing, 'Well, who's in the floating house, and how
did they get there and where are they going?"'
Figuring out the answers to these questions
led to the concept for "Up," the latest entry in
the Disney/Pixar hit parade. The film focuses
on the life of Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Ed
Asner, TV's "Lou Grant"), a diminutive 78-year-
old man who ties thousands of balloons to his
house so he can fly to South America, and Rus-
sell (newcomer Jordan Nagai), the Boy Scout
who smuggles a ride aboard.
Early drafts of the screenplay had Carl and
Russell going to a tropical island. Eventually,
though, Docter decided to send the characters
somewhere more original-and turned to South
America's Tapui mountains for inspiration.
Docter acknowledged the unorthodox

choice to anchor a family-friendly film with
an old man as its protagonist, but he noted
that he and the other Pixar filmmakers never
think about marketability during the produc-
tion process..
"We make these films for ourselves," he
explained. "We just think about, 'Is this inter-
esting to me, as a person, as an audience mem-
ber? Am I engaged? Do I care?"'
Still, Docter notes that making an animated
film isn't all fun and games.
"You're working on cartoons, happy, fun,
Pixar la-la land, but it is, you know, there comes
a point where you start to think of yourself asa
failure if you don't get this done," he said.
"Up" wasn't immune to this pressure, and
many challenges were present in the film's cre-
ation.
"Every film we've gone through, it seems
like there's some new technological hurdle,"
Docter said.
He found designing the.characters and set-
ting to be the most taxing challenge.
"This was a
story where the
main character
floats his house to
South America.
It's a completely
implausible idea.
And if we could
somehow create a sinCe 1978
caricature world,
I think we felt like

we could make that a lot more believable and
real to the audience than if you made it super-
realistic."
"Up" will also mark another milestone for
being the first Pixar movie to be released in 3-D.
Docter explained that a separate "3-D Team"
was formed after the film's initial conception
to follow the main crew around and implement
the extra dimension. They had.to be conscious
of things that wouldn't work in 3-D, like objects
breaking the edge of the frame as they rush
towards the audience.
Docter said he was also very careful not to
rely on throw-things-at-the-audience types of
gags.
"The screen is almost like a window look-
ing into this world," he said, summarizing the
angle they were approaching the new dimen-
sion from. "We're not selling 3-D. We're selling
the story itself, and the 3-D's going to be in sup-
port of that."
The fruits ofDocter's labors can be seen when
"Up" takes flight nationwide on May 29th.

ANOTHER STEP CLOSER-

By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Writer
Every playoff run needs a hero.
And the Michigan softball
team's journey through the NCAA
Regionals was no exception. Luck-
ily for them, they had an plenty of
heroes as they beat Notre Dame
4-0 to win the regional final Sun-
day for the sixth consecutive year.
The magic started the previous
day when the Wolverines were
down 1-0 with only their last two
outs to play with. Junior Maggie
Viefhaus stepped to the plate, and
four pitches later the ball landed in
the grass behind the grandstand
in right field for a solo home run.
Four batters later, it was an 0-for-3
freshman who had the chance tobe
the unlikely hero.
Withrunners on first and second,
Bree Evans' bloop single sent the
crowd at Alumni Field home for the
day and put Michigan in position to
move on to the Super Regionals.
Evans has a knack for the pres-
sure situations. In the regional
final the next day, she scored the
first and eventual game-winning
run in the sixth inning, and then
followed it up with a clinching
double an inning later that plated
the third run.
"Today I was able to read (Notre
Dame pitcher Brittney Barger's)
pitches better than yesterday,"
Evans said. "I knew coming into
today I really wanted to hit her
because of how I did yesterday, I
didn't have my best outing."

In addition to the newfound
hero, a long-standing one emerged
yet again in sophomore pitcher Jor-
dan Taylor.
After throwing a seven-inning
complete game and allowing only
one run against Notre Dame on
Saturday, Taylor was called by
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins to
come in in relief of junior pitcher
Nikki Nemitz after Nemitz gave up
a walk in the sixth inning.
"It was a one-run game, and a
runner on base, we've got Jordan,
who they haven't seen all game,
who throws totally different than
Nikki," Hutchins said. "It was a
momentum shift and in a tight
game I didn't want any momentum
going their way.
"I have two great pitchers and
I'm going to use them both every
game if that is what it is going to
take to win."
Taylor allowed only two hits in
1.2 innings and struck out four of
the last five batters.
Taylor struck out Notre Dame's
Erin Marrone but a dropped third
strike allowed Marrone to get on
base. After a single put two runners
on Michigan fans were holdingtheir
breath. But when Taylor got two
consecutive outs, the Michigan fans
exhaled with a roar of approval.
"It makes it a little different just
because the batter has seen the
pitch," Taylor said. "They did a
good job yesterday of startingto lay
off some of my pitches towards the
end of the game. I think that car-
ried on into today and they weren't

chasing as much."
Nemitz's performance wasn't
far behind Taylor's heroism on the
mound.
Nemitz went 5.1 innings, allow-
ing only three hits, but was pulled
in favor of Taylor. Not content
with only pitching a shutout, Nem-
itz found another way to make
her presence felt after leaving the
circle.
In her next at-bat, Nemitz took
a 1-0 pitch and sent it to right field
where it clanged off of the foul pole.
"I was just going up there to hit
the ball hard, we weren't hitting
her all day," Nemitz said. "It was

the seventh inning and the last
chance to score and really get the
momentum going our way."
Michigan's quest continues in
the Super Regionals as the fifth-
seeded Wolverines take on Baylor
next weekend at home at Alumni
Field. Hutchins and her team know
that new heroes will emerge, one
way or another.
"We've been in the World Series
eight times and it's never been easy
to get there, but it's getting harder
and harder," Hutchins said. "To
get throughregionals, I don't take
anything for granted, any champi-
onship."

Fifth-place finish
sends Blue to second
Finals in 41 years
By NICK SPAR
Daily Sports Writer
As sophomore Lion Kim stepped
to the final tee, Michigan men's golf
coach Andrew Sapp assured him
a NCAA Finals bid was essentially
secured. But even though a finals
appearance no longer hung in the
balance, Kim still felt an adrenaline
rush with each shot.
His par on the final hole of the
NCAA Regionals in Austin, Texas
sealed a trip to the finals for No. 45
Michigan - its first finals appear-
ance since 1997 and second in 41
years.
The five teams with the low-
est 54-hole totals at the University
of Texas Golf Club for the three-
day event qualified for the NCAA
Finals. No. 45 Michigan topped No.
41 Lamar for the fifth and final spot
by three strokes, the same margin
by which it missed the finals last
season.
So Kim had reason to fight his
nerves - he was responsible for fin-
ishing off an accomplishment his
team was so close to reaching last
year.
"I've never been that nervous
over my tee shot on 18," Kim said.
"That's not a feeling I've had for a

BIG TEN BLUES

By CHANTEL JENNINGS
Daily Sports Editor
Senior pitcher Chris Fetter felt
his season end before it was actu-
ally over.
The Wolverines had just
allowed the Wildcats to score six
uncontested runs during the fifth
and sixth innings. The Wolver-
ines' lead had deteriorated into a
10-6 deficit.
Then, after the sixth inning
as Michigan (9-15 Big Ten, 30-25
overall) was headed back to the
dugout, a voice came over the
loudspeaker announcing that
Purdue was comfortably leading
Illinois 8-1 going into the sixth
inning.
Fetter's heart sank. The dugout
went silent. Michigan baseball
coach Rich Maloney said nothing.
A Boilermaker victory meant there
would be no Big Ten Tournament
run, no four-peat as Big Ten cham-
pions, no trip to Columbus.
And as expected, Purdue went
on to beat the Fighting Illini,12-8.
Still, the Wolverines had to fin-
ish Saturday's doubleheader, end-
ing in 10-6 and 6-5 losses.
"I was pretty hard for all of us

while, even until my last putt."
The Wolverines improved their
score over each of the three days,
performing best when it mattered
most and fired an eight-over 292
in the final round. That was the
lowest final round mark of any
team in the field which featured
nine ranked squads, including No.
5 Stanford and No. 8 Florida.
Michigan heads to Toledo, Ohio
for the NCAA Finals beginning on
May 26 along with Florida, which
won the event, Stanford, No. 17
Texas Tech and No. 24 Texas.
Michigan's mental toughness
and its depth were on display
after the impressive final round
score came despite a two-and-
a-half hour rain delay about 35
minutes after play began. Its
standing ranged from fourth to
eighth throughout the back-nine.
Although no player finished in
the top-15, all five finished in the
top-50.
"We just wanted to make sure
we didn't make any mental errors
and that we executed the shots
we wanted to play," Sapp said.

because we've never really played
a game where it didn't mean any-
thing," Fetter said. "That was hard
to sit there and watch that game
and know that it didn't really
count towards anything."
Fetter had done all he could on
Thursday night during the first
game of the series. After pitch-
ing three scoreless innings, Fetter
allowed six runs during the fourth
inning. But Fetter and freshman
Brandon Sinnery were able to keep
the Wildcats silent after that as the
Wolverines used a nine-run sev-
enth inning to claim the first game
of the series, 16-6.
At the plate, junior Mike Dufek
led the offensive attack, going
2-for-4 with two home runs and
four RBI., despite Northwestern's
best efforts to slow the scoring
surge with three pitchers in the
seventh.
For the past three seasons, the
Wolverines hoisted the Big Ten
Tournament title trophy, but this
year they came two wins short of
a postseason berth.

team's disappointing end to the
season, go to michigandaily.com.
"We did a good job of doing that,
and that's why we're advancing to
nationals."
Michigan finished each of the
first two rounds in seventh place.
Senior co-captain Bill Rankin shot
an 80 in the first round, but kept
his team in contention by improv-
ing his play by nine strokes in the
second round with a tournament
team-low, even-par 71.
A private team meeting after
the second round paid dividends
for the Wolverines, as they out-
played eight of the nation's top 50
programs, including two top-10
teams. Three of Michigan's final
round scores were the players'
lowest scores of the tournament.
"We pretty much knew that we
had nothing to lose (in the final
round)," Kim said. "All of us felt
like that we had another good
round in us, and we knew that if we
just stayed patient and committed
to every shot that we would take
advantage of the opportunity."
While the Regional course in
Texas was an unfamiliar one,
Michigan will be familiar with
the Inverness Club, the site of the
finals in Toledo, having played a
practice round on the course two
weeks ago.
