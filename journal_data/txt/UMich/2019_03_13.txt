On Tuesday, a coalition of left-
leaning 
organizations 
hosted 
a teach-in titled “Umich is 
Complicit in East Quad Residence 
Hall” to highlight what they called 
the University of Michigan’s 
history of inaction against white 
supremacy. The event was held 
in response to Young Americans 
for Freedom’s invitation to Ben 
Shapiro, a conservative political 
commentator, to speak at the 
University. Shapiro addressed 
a crowd of more than 1,000 
students at Rackham Auditorium 
on Tuesday. 
According to LSA sophomore 
Mani Samei, a student organizer 
with the Michigan Student Power 
Network, one of the organizations 

co-hosting the event, the teach-in 
sought to tie Shapiro’s speech to a 
larger trend of white supremacy 
on campus and raise awareness 
about the #UMichisComplicit 
campaign. 
“So we were like, okay, we 
can use this opportunity and 
the 
thing 
that’s 
happening 
on campus to galvanize some 
energy towards kicking off this 
campaign that folks have been 
talking about for a little while, the 
#UMichisComplicit 
campaign, 
to sort of bring more popular 
consciousness on campus just 
the fact that this University is 
founded on white supremacy and 
continues to further that,” Samei 
said.

The 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 
Wallace 
House 
held an event titled “Prisoner: 
My 544 Days in an Iranian 
Prison” on Tuesday in the 
Lydia Mendelssohn Theatre. 
The 
event 
featured 
Jason 
Rezaian, a Global Opinions 
writer for The Washington 
Post, to discuss his new book 
“Prisoner,” which describes 
his 18-month experience in an 
Iranian prison.
“Prisoner” 
chronicles 
Rezaian’s time spent in Evin, 
an Iranian prison, known 
for its poor conditions and 

its housing of the country’s 
political 
prisoners. 
During 
the 
event, 
Bill 
McCarren, 
executive 
director 
of 
the 
National 
Press 
Club, 
a 
professional organization for 
journalists, 
explained 
how 
the book also highlights the 
people and culture of Iran, as 
well as issues with freedom of 
the press globally.
“I think it will change what 
you think about the region,” 
McCarren said. “It will change 
what you think about Iran and 
it will change what you think 
about journalism.”
The majority of the event 
was a Q&A session between 
McCarren and Rezaian. After 

anecdotes 
about 
Rezaian’s 
interests in sports, the two 
dove into questions about 
Rezaian’s 
imprisonment 
experience in a country he 
called home for several years 
of his life.
Rezaian was born in the 
U.S. to an Iranian father and 
grew up in California before 
moving to Iran for part of his 
adult life to pursue journalism. 
From 
2012 
through 
2016, 
Rezaian served in Iran as the 
Tehran bureau chief for The 
Washington Post.
In July 2014, Rezaian and 
his wife, Yeganeh Rezaian, 
were in their home in Iran, 
getting ready to attend his 

mother’s birthday party. After 
entering 
the 
elevator, 
the 
journalist was confronted at 
gunpoint by a member of the 
Iranian Revolutionary Guard 
Corps.
Rezaian 
described 
how 
after having his apartment 
ransacked, the IRGC took the 
couple into custody. Yeganeh 
remained in prison for 72 
days and Rezaian remained in 
prison for 544 days.
“I’m glad that my experience 
ended after 544 days,” Rezaian 
said. “At the same time, this 
should have never happened 
in the first place. But I realize 
it could’ve been much worse.”

The 
University 
of 
Michigan Central Student 
Government met Tuesday 
night to discuss a resolution 
to recommend revising the 
current University sexual 
misconduct 
policy 
and 
debated 
changing 
their 
weekly meeting time.
LSA 
freshman 
Emma 
Sandberg 
and 
LSA 
sophomore Josiah Walker 
proposed a resolution to 
the 
Student 
Assembly 
regarding the revision of 
the 
University’s 
sexual 
misconduct 
policy. 
In 
their presentation of the 
resolution, 
Sandberg 
and 
Walker explained the recent 
changes to the policy in 
which a cross-examination 
is now required in sexual 
misconduct 
cases. 
They 
said this change may cause 
emotional trauma to the 
survivor, as the survivor 
will 
be 
required 
to 
be 
directly questioned by the 
alleged perpetrator in the 
examination.

The University of Michigan 
History 
Department, 
in 
collaboration with the History 
Club, hosted an event on Tuesday 
called “When Provocateurs Dabble 
in History: Ben Shapiro and the 
Enwhitenment,” coinciding with 
Ben Shapiro’s speech on campus.
Anne Berg, assistant director 
of 
Undergraduate 
Studies 
for 
the History Department and the 
History Club’s adviser, introduced 
the event, which focused on the 
title of Ben Shapiro’s upcoming 
book, “The Right Side of History: 
How Reason and Moral Purpose 
Made the West Great.”
“There were some suggestions 
in here that there is a wrong side of 
history, as the History Club pointed 
out in their message, that the West 
is great, and that there’s a causal 
inference that reason and moral 
purpose made it so,” Berg said.
At the same time as this event, 
Shapiro 
spoke 
in 
Rackham 
Auditorium to an audience of 
more than 1,000 people. The 
conservative political commentator 
acknowledged the History Club’s 
event in his on-campus speech.

THIS WEEK IN HISTORY: OVER 13,000 ATTEND 
‘KICKOFF’ ON ENVIRONMENT

Drew 
Haynam 
was 
no 
ordinary 
Michigan 
football 
fan. 
Haynam, 
who 
passed 
away 
on 
Feb. 26, seriously loved 
Michigan football — so 
much so that his family 
decided to host his calling 
hours in maize and blue 
and play the fight song 
at his funeral. In lieu 
of 
flowers, 
his 
family 
asked for donations to 
be sent to the University 
of 
Michigan 
Alumni 
Association.
Haynam graduated from 
John Carroll University 
in 1979 with a degree in 
business. He spent a year 
at Ohio State University 
and joined a fraternity 
popular 
with 
football 
players there. According 
to his daughter, Melissa 
Libertini, Haynam caused 
trouble by playing “The 
Victors,” the University 
of Michigan’s fight song, 
in the fraternity house.
“I think he did it just 
so that when he was 
in his dorm room one 
day, or house, he locked 
himself 
in 
his 
room 
and started playing the 
Michigan fight song on 
his stereo super loud,” 
Libertini said. “Of course 
everybody in the house is 
going crazy, so they had 
to call his brother and 
they say, ‘You better come 
get your brother because 
he’s about to get the crap 
beaten out of him if he 
doesn’t turn this crap 
off.’”
Libertini 
remembers 
Haynam as an easygoing 
father 
with 
a 
passion 
for 
strategizing 
about 
Michigan football.
“He had the funniest 
sense of humor ever, it 
was just very dry, very 
sardonic,” Libertini said. 
“He was obviously a big 
Michigan 
football 
fan. 
Loved Starbucks coffee, 
and I don’t know, we 
always just had really 
funny 
conversations, 
about, 
especially 
in 
recent years — because 

the 
Michigan 
Football 
team hasn’t been doing 
so good — just always 
hypothesizing about what 
they 
could 
do 
better. 
Every 
year, 
whenever 
they were doing their 
recruiting, and he’d find 
out they would get a good 
quarterback or some good 
player recruited. When 
they got Jim Harbaugh he 
was super excited.”
According to Libertini, 
Haynam 
attended 
Michigan football games 
at The Big House as a 
child. This inspired his 
love of The Team. 
“I really think it was 
probably 
just 
because 
it’s the experience he 
had going to the games 
as a young kid, just the 
whole experience of it 
all,” Libertini said. “The 
maize and blue.”

She continued, saying 
Haynam’s 
passion 
extended to all aspects of 
Michigan football. 

“He loved Bob Ufer, 
the guy who did the 
sportscasting, he loved 
that guy,” Libertini said. 
“He just loved everything 
about it, he loved the 

whole 
team 
and 
the 
mascot, he loved how the 
helmets looked, the fight 
song, the Big House. He 
just loved it all.”
Libertini said if Haynam 
could offer any advice to 
the Michigan Wolverines 
today, it would be this:
“That they got to get 
their act together, so they 
can beat Ohio State this 
year.”
Libertini spoke of her 
father’s good character. 
According 
to 
her, 
he 
was open to having a 
conversation with anyone 
— even if they supported 
the Buckeyes. 
“He was a really, really 
nice, 
easygoing 
man,” 
Libertini said. “Even if 
you were an Ohio State 
fan, he’d still sit down 
and talk to you. And he is 
greatly, greatly missed.”

March 12 , 1970
A call for commitment, 
change and action to “Give 
Earth a Chance”, was the 
theme last night as over 13,000 
people attended the kickoff 
rally for the University’s teach-
in on the environment.
“We cannot defer for long 
a confrontation with the real 
debt that we owe to nature-

the total reorganization of 
our system of productivity to 
make it compatible with the 
ecosystem,” ecologist Barry 
Commoner told the mammoth 
crowd that filled Crisler Arena. 
Commoner, along with Sen. 
Gaylord 
Nelson, 
geneticist 
James Shapiro, Gov. William 
Milliken, actor Arthur Godfrey 
and 
University 
President 

Robben Fleming, emphasized 
the urgency of environmental 
problems and the need for a 
sustained effort to solve them.
“The important fact is that 
we’re sitting on a delayed-
action bomb and we had 
better defuse it as quick as 
we can,” Milliken said. “Our 
responsibility is not just to 
save our own skins but to have 

humanity.” 
Despite 
wide 
agreement 
that environmental problems 
exist, the peaceful rally was 
not without dissension. Many 
of the speakers were heckled 
by audience members and 
criticized in a fake program 
produced by Students for a 
Democratic 
Society, 
which 
also organized a card section.

Remembering the life of Michigan 
football superfan Drew Haynam


Shapiro said he regularly 
seeks 
out 
perspectives 
contrary to his own.
“I actually like multiple 
opinions,” Shapiro said. “I am 
in favor of hearing multiple 
points of view.” 
Shapiro’s 
discussion 
focused heavily on the threat 
of 
government 
compulsion. 
He said the current political 
climate 
champions 
a 
government that extends too 
far into citizens’ lives. 
“When 
government 
is 
activated to invade the rights 
of other people, even for the 
purported good of the many, 
that’s 
when 
government 
is 
a 
bully,” 
Shapiro 
said. 
“That’s what we are seeing 
increasingly these days. The 
call for socialism, in essence, 
is a call to invade the rights of 
others, on behalf of yourself or 
on behalf of the greater good.”
LSA junior Kate Westa, vice 
chair of YAF, said Shapiro’s 
decision to accept the invitation 
to speak at the University 
was 
fueled 
by 
a 
growing 
movement among conservative 
speakers to promote right-
wing 
ideologies 
among 
traditionally 
left-leaning 
communities, 
noting 
the 
frequent protests on campus 
and the recent movement to 
divest from companies that 
do business with Israel. Westa 
compared the University to 
the University of California, 
Berkeley, a school with a well-
known liberal atmosphere.

“Michigan 
is 
such 
a 
powerhouse in the Big 10 for 
liberals,” Westa said. “I think 
that’s why a lot of conservative 
speakers are drawn to it. I 
think the first thing that 
comes to people’s minds when 
they think of leftist colleges 
is Berkeley and those kinds 
of places, but lately with the 
BDS movement and protests 
happening … a lot of people 
are realizing that we are going 
through a lot of the same things 
that Berkeley is, and want to 
come here and fight that.”
Shapiro 
concluded 
his 
opening speech by discussing 
how 
the 
restoration 
of 
American values was key to 
maintaining a unified social 
fabric, not government policy 
predicated on compulsion.
“If 
you 
want 
to 
fuel 
America … then we need to get 
together and we need to form 
a social framework without 
government 
forcing 
people 
to do so,” Shapiro said. “Then 
what we end up with is a 
government too big for anyone 
to control and a government 
that 
in 
essence 
ends 
up 
controlling all of us.”
After his talk, Shapiro held 
a Q&A session, during which 
audience members broached 
various topics, ranging from 
abortion to school lunches. A 
student asked Shapiro if he 
considered the Civil Rights Act 
of 1964 a violation of individual 
freedoms because it took away 
people’s ability to decide with 
whom they wanted to work 
or do business. Shapiro said 
while he personally opposed 

racism, he did not believe 
the government was properly 
situated to prohibit people 
from discriminating against 
one another.
“I don’t think the law has 
any role whatsoever in banning 
race-based 
discrimination 
by private actors,” Shapiro 
said. “If I don’t have a right to 
your services then I certainly 
don’t have a right to ask the 
government to require you 
to provide me those services. 
That 
means 
discriminatory 
people are not punished by 
government, they are punished 
by everyone else who won’t 
go 
to 
the 
discriminatory 
restaurant 
because 
they 
realize 
it’s 
discriminatory. 
They answer to the market.”
LSA sophomore Raj Aryal 
attended the talk. He praised 
Shapiro’s commitment to fact-
based arguments.
“I went to the Shapiro 
event because I align with 
him ideologically,” Aryal said. 
“I really like his messages of 
having diverse opinions and 
perspectives on campus, and I 
wanted to hear a conservative 
voice … I feel that there’s a 
lot within the conservative 
movement that is controversial 
… I like the way he addresses 
his critics and how he leans 
more on the intellectual side of 
arguments.”
About two dozen protestors 
gathered 
on 
the 
steps 
of 
Rackham prior to Shapiro’s 
talk, lining the entrance as 
audience 
members 
arrived. 
They flew an LGBT pride flag 
and carried posters in support 

of transgender people. 
Robert 
Jay, 
media 
director 
for 
Metro-Detroit 
Political 
Action 
Network, 
an intersectional civil rights 
group, said hosting outspoken 
commentators 
like 
Shapiro 
potentially 
normalizes 
the 
dehumanization of minority 
identities. 
“It’s 
a 
great 
concern,” 
Jay 
said. 
“Anytime 
you’re 
promoting 
language 
that 
dehumanizes people, you’re 
conditioning 
people 
to 
accept 
dehumanization. 
No 
matter what reason, you’re 
dehumanizing someone. Once 
people get comfortable with 
that will start applying that 
to different things they don’t 
understand.”
Counter-protesters 
in 
support of Shapiro assembled 
across 
the 
street 
from 
Rackham. Among them was 
Batts 
Adams, 
a 
resident 
from Lansing who supports 
Shapiro. Adams said having 
conservative 
speakers 
on 
campus is crucial to promote 
freedom of speech. 
“It’s a public university and 
being a public university and 
funded by the government, 
they should uphold the U.S. 
Constitution,” 
Adams 
said. 
“The U.S. Constitution grants 
every U.S. citizen the right to 
the freedom of speech, and 
so if somebody wants to come 
here on campus and they want 
to assemble and exercise their 
freedom of speech, they should 
be allowed to, whether I agree 
with or disagree with their 
personal views.”

“Thanks, also, to the University 
of Michigan History Department, 
which apparently is sponsoring an 
event titled, ‘When Provocateurs 
Dabble in History: Ben Shapiro 
and the Enwhitenment,’ which 
seems mean … which will be really 
fascinating to hear how these 
history professors critique a book 
they haven’t read since it’s not 
released until next week,” Shapiro 
said in his speech.
At the History Club discussion, 
Berg 
acknowledged 
that 
the 
panel had not yet read the book, 
and 
instead 
focused 
on 
its 
controversial title.
“We haven’t read the book, so 
you can’t debunk something that 
you don’t know …” Berg said. “We 
latched onto the title of something 
that is deeply problematic.”
Berg introduced the event by 
discussing the importance of 
accurately reporting history.
“To me, when I see the use of 
history in the public sphere I think 
it’s a great thing, but I also think 
it’s important that you don’t use 
it to just provoke … rather than in 
a sincere intellectual way or in a 
sincere political way,” Berg said.
Berg 
discussed 
the 
Enlightenment’s relationship to 
his book title’s emphasis on reason. 
She suggested Shapiro’s book title 
fails to recognize the negative 
consequences arising from the 
Enlightenment 
period, 
citing 
genocide, slavery and imperial 
regimes.
“If 
you 
think 
about 
the 
Enlightenment as a source of 
thoughts and ideals that made 
all of those events, both the 
achievements of Western society 
and societies elsewhere possible 
... but also those discontents 
that usually we can relegate to 
aberrations of history,” Berg said.
Panelist 
Angela 
Dillard, 
associate dean for Undergraduate 
Education, 
continued 
Berg’s 
narrative on the importance of 
history.
“There’s a national debate about 
history,” Dillard said. “I thought, 
this is a great thing to want to do, 
to think about how so many of 
the arguments that we’re having 
ideologically and politically really 
are about the nature of history, 
and what we think it is.”
Dillard 
suggested 
Shapiro’s 
idealization of reason frames 

historical events in a problematic 
manner.
“It’s a really horrifying vision 
about not accounting for the 
damage of slavery and colonialism 
and 
the 
robbing 
people 
of 
personhood,” said Dillard.
The 
panel 
also 
discussed 
Shapiro’s other political stances, 
including his critique of higher 
education 
institutions 
in 
his 
2004 book titled, “Brainwashed: 
How Universities Indoctrinate 
America’s Youth.” LSA senior 
Nikola Jaksic, Vice President 
of the History Club criticized 
Shapiro’s insinuation of students’ 
lack of autonomy.
“As a student of history, it’s 
pretty 
infantilizing 
to 
have 
him imply that I am somehow 
unable to have agency in my own 
education,” Jaksic said. “That no 
matter what I do, I’m just going to 
be indoctrinated into this dogma 
that he so fears.”
Associate history professor John 
Carson discussed the perspectives 
of a Shapiro supporter.
“Here’s someone who is telling 
me that at least some of the things 
that I have always believed about 
democracy and about religion are 
true …” Carson said. “(Shapiro’s 
ideology) 
re-instantiates 
a 
narrative and a world where they 
feel very lost as to what’s going 
on.”
Prior to the event, the History 
Club received pushback from 
critics on Twitter and Facebook, 
who suggested the panel provided 
a biased view of the subject. Jaksic 
addressed this during the event. 
“We didn’t want to sacrifice 
having an explicitly conservative 
voice at the expense of, one, making 
sure that they people that are 
presenting … feel welcome and safe 
in the space and, two, to ‘pretend’ 
that there is any discussion in our 
history community about these 
topics,” Jaksic said.
Berg 
said 
that 
while 
she 
appreciates a critical mindset, she 
stands by the panel’s qualification 
and depth.
“The accusation of bias is 
one 
that 
I’m 
fundamentally 
sympathetic to,” Berg said. “I want 
my students to disagree. To me, it’s 
a signal to the kind of work that 
we do that people feel comfortable 
doing that … I don’t think that the 
panel was biased in a way that 
was trying to erase various parts, 
I think people were generally 
honest about their intellectual 
trajectory.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Maya 
Chamra told The Daily after the 
event she felt the teach-in, a form 
of 
alternative 
programming, 
was the appropriate response to 
Shapiro’s visit. 
“I think that the idea of 
alternative 
programming 
is 
much 
more 
effective 
when 
responding to somebody like 
Ben Shapiro, because he thrives 
off of this perception that he is 
just presenting facts, and he’s 
presenting information, and he’s 
very logical and pragmatic, and 
that’s why a lot of people are 
attracted to him,” Chamra said. 
“And it’s not because they have 
very extreme views — they’re 
just intrigued by what he says.”
Chamra said the teach-in did 
not feed into Shapiro’s narrative. 
The teach-in itself was attended 
by more than 30 students and 
focused on providing a history 
of white supremacy at the 
University activists say is largely 
ignored. 
“I think we can make change 
just starting by educating people, 
and I think a teach-in is much 
more effective in doing that, 
than say protesting, because 
Ben Shapiro and the organizers 
for that event can predict all 
the tactics for protesting or just 
buying tickets, and it feeds very 
well into their narrative, but a 

teach-in does not look good to 
them,” Chamra said. “It doesn’t 
work well with their narrative 
because all we’re just trying to 
do is educate people.”
Samei stressed that the goal 
of the event was to highlight 
the University’s role in allowing 
white supremacists to speak, 
including their decision to pay 
for Shapiro and other speakers’ 
security. 
“This particular individual 
really likes to create intellectual 
debate around saying really 
harmful things to people,” Samei 
said. “So instead of allowing for 
a platform for that violence to 
occur, we were like okay, we’re 
not going to make this between 
organizers 
and 
the 
white 
supremacists. We’re gonna make 
this the elephant in the room, 
which is that the University 
is paying for his security, and 
the University has paid for the 
security of white supremacists, 
which is actually a lot of money.”
While the organizers of the 
event chose to utilize alternative 
programming for this particular 
speech, some maintained that 
direct action tactics are also 
successful. 
Music, 
Theatre 
& 
Dance 
senior 
Isabelle 
Malnar’s 
organization, Radfun, a social 
justice organization, co-hosted 
the 
teach-in. 
Malnar 
said 
direct action, such as protests 
and marches, were effective in 

preventing white supremacist 
Richard Spencer from choosing 
to speak at the University, even 
if the University did not pursue 
legal action to prevent him 
from speaking. The University’s 
decision 
to 
allow 
Richard 
Spencer to speak last year 
caused controversy and spurred 
a protest movement dubbed 
#StopSpencer. 
“I would like to add that things 
like that have been successful,” 
Malnar said. “Last year there 
was a lot of direct action work 
against Richard Spencer and he 
didn’t end up coming, so I think 
that it’s not good to say that it 
isn’t always successful, but in 
this instance we thought more 
of a teaching and healing and 
discussion space would be more 
effective for this particular 
event.”
Hoai An Pham, LSA senior, 
and Vidhya Aravind, a master’s 
student 
in 
the 
School 
of 
Information, led the teach-in. 
Pham and Aravind started their 
presentation by speaking to the 
power of student activism. 
“Everything good at this 
University 
exists 
because 
of 
student 
activism,” 
Pham 
said. “That includes SAPAC 
(Sexual Assault Prevention and 
Awareness Center), Spectrum 
Center, 
the 
Department 
of 
African American Studies, and 
others.”
The panel later addressed 

the 
ways 
they 
believe 
the 
University has been complicit 
in 
white 
supremacy, 
such 
as 
administration’s 
initial 
refusal to rename the building 
formerly known as C.C. Little, 
a eugenicist, and the decline of 
African-American 
enrollment 
rates 
at 
the 
University 
in 
response to affirmative action 
lawsuits. 
Chamra said most members 
of the U-M community are 
unaware of the University’s 
history with white supremacy, 
something 
she 
claims 
the 
University 
has 
purposefully 
worked to hide. 
“I don’t think it’s widely 
known at all and I think the 
University 
plays 
a 
part 
in 
making sure there’s not a lot of 
bad information spread about 
them and it’s really fallen on 
organizers and activists to make 
the information known not just 
to themselves, but to the broader 
public,” Chamra said. “That’s 
why an event like this is really 
important, because it’s really 
hard to get involved in activism 
if you’d like to get involved, but 
it’s also even harder to learn 
about the ways in which the 
University’s been resistant to 
activism. And it really isn’t 
widely known and it’s really 
a shame. Because we could 
make a lot of great changes if 
more people knew about this 
information.”

In September, the U.S. Sixth Circuit 

Court of Appeals ruled the University 

must change its sexual misconduct 

policy to give the student who is accused 

of sexual assault the chance to cross-

examine the accuser. The University’s 

previous policy did not require a cross-

examination or an in-person hearing, 

and the policy was revised to include 

these aspects in October.

Following the ruling, the new student 

group Jane Roe created a petition asking 

the University to adjust the policy to 

have the cross-examination conducted 

by an advisor instead of the alleged 

perpetrator. As of March 12, the petition 

had 64,824 signatures.

Jane Roe continued their efforts 

to change the policy by meeting with 

a sexual misconduct case manager, 

according to Walker. 

“We then met with a sexual 

misconduct case manager in the Office 

of Student Conflict Resolution,” Walker 

said. “In this meeting, we inquired 

about why this policy was implemented, 

whether students were notified about 

and given a chance to critique the policy 

and whether the University have plans 

to revise the policy, especially its cross-

examination model. Similar to other 

exchanges with administrators, this 

conversation followed a pattern.”

Walker further said the administrator 

told them the University did not want 

to turn an administrative process into 

a court-like proceeding and feared not 

all students would be represented by 

counsel. According to Walker, proposed 

Title IX regulations require institutions 

to provide an adviser for the duration of 

cross-examination.

Walker said Jane Roe insisted the 

University include student input by 

forming an advisory board to revise the 

policy and to allow students to provide 

feedback, as well as to notify students 

about the policy change.

“Although the University fulfilled 

our secondary request, the cross-

examination model has not yet been 

revised,” Walker said. “As long as this 

policy stands, it will be applied to every 

single student case of sexual assault 

at the University of Michigan. This is 

likely to have a devastating impact on 

survivors and on our campus safety.”

Sandberg agreed with Walker and 

said the policy did not ensure student 

safety at the University.

“Enforcing this policy is a gross 

deviation 
from 
the 
University’s 

responsibility to protect its students,” 

Sandberg said. “This form of cross-

examination is unnecessary, and I 

personally consider it to be cruel.”

Sandberg 
called 
the 
cross-

examination model inhumane and said 

the University’s investigative process 

will have consequences for both those 

who go through with the process or 

those who decide against it.

“The University of Michigan has 

argued that those who decided on this 

cross-examination model have the best 

interest of survivors of sexual assault 

in mind,” Sandberg said. “To rephrase, 

the University actually believes that 

survivors of sexual assault would find 

it less traumatic to be grilled by their 

rapist or assaulter than by a third party. 

I can’t speak for all survivors of sexual 

assault, but I believe I can speak for 

the vast majority when I say that being 

questioned by one’s perpetrator would 

be significantly more traumatic than by 

any attorney.”

LSA 
freshman 
Sam 
Braden 

questioned the equality of the policy. He 

discussed the possible inequity present 

if one of the parties can afford a more 

expensive lawyer and asked about how 

the University assigns a defense attorney 

to students.

“I know we say the whole court 

system is very equal, but people who 

can afford better lawyers are more likely 

going to win a case,” Braden said.

CSG Speaker Austin Glass, Rackham 

student, said although he understands 

equity concerns regarding the policy, 

clinical studies have shown a third 

party agent should conduct a cross-

examination. He said administrators 

have not found the need to include 

student voices in the creation of the 

policy.

“I recognize your equity concerns, 

but at the end of the day, the current 

system is almost unbelievable,” Glass 

said. “To a passive observer, I think the 

attempt here is to address the fact that 

the system is one which, in discussion 

with administrators, the student office 

on this hasn’t found any significant 

desire to make change to.”

The Assembly referred the resolution 

to the Resolutions and Communications 

committees.

During the event and as 
described in his book, Rezaian 
explained he was imprisoned 
at 
the 
start 
of 
the 
Joint 
Comprehensive Plan of Action, 
an agreement between Iran and 
the P5+1 (China, France, Russia, 
United Kingdom, United States 
and Germany) regarding the 
Iranian nuclear program. In 
an interview with U.S. News, 
Rezaian described how because 
he was taken by the IRGC, who 
did not want the Iran deal to 
continue, he quickly became a 
part of the negotiations.
“So I see my arrest in that 
context,” Rezaian said in the 
U.S. News interview. “As an 
attempt by internal forces in the 
country to make problems for 
the (President) Hassan Rouhani 
administration at the time when 
they were engaged in these 
negotiations with world powers 
including the United States.”
Rezaian 
said 
during 
his 
imprisonment his interrogators 
attempted to get him to admit to 
espionage. Though he found it 
difficult, Rezaian said he never 
admitted to this crime, which 
he did not commit. McCarren 
commended him for holding 
his ground in the high-pressure 
environment.
“You’re not the first journalist 
to be held in prison,” McCarren 

said. “But there seemed to be a 
pattern where journalists could 
be released if they would state 
that a charge was real, even if it 
seemed like no one had believed 
the charges. You didn’t do that, 
you stood your ground … As a 
journalist, I was incredibly proud 
that you would do that.”
LSA 
senior 
Olivia 
Abedi 
described to The Daily after the 
event how valuable she believed 
Rezaian’s 
actions 
against 
pleading guilty were, especially 
for students.
“In cases like these, staying 
true to yourself and what you’re 
doing ring through,” Abedi said. 
“The fact that Jason never plead 
guilty to make things easier on 
himself was a good thing I think 
for all students and anybody to 
understand.”
McCarren and the National 
Press Club, as well as the general 
spread in media awareness of 
Rezaian’s situation, contributed 
greatly to the release of Rezaian. 
Lynette Clemetson, director of 
Wallace House, described the 
organization’s vast efforts toward 
Rezaian’s case.
“Bill and his colleagues at 
the National Press Club fought 
tirelessly for Jason’s release, 
even at one point holding a read-
a-thon where they read Jason’s 
work for 24 hours in shifts,” 
Clemetson said. “They made sure 
that Jason’s name stayed in the 
news and that his story stayed in 

the news and that pressure stayed 
on the officials who needed to 
take getting him out of there 
seriously.”
The 
conversation 
between 
McCarren and Rezaian ended 
with a discussion on Anthony 
Bourdain, who not only made 
an episode of his CNN show 
“Anthony 
Bourdain: 
Parts 
Unknown” 
about 
Iran 
and 
Rezaian, advocating on his behalf 
while Rezaian was in prison, but 
also published Rezaian’s book. 
Rezaian described his profound 
gratitude for the late journalist.
“I think for Yeganeh and me, 
he’s our champion,” Rezaian 
said. “Lots of people had seen 
the episode of ‘Parts Unknown’ 
that we were on, some people 
know that he was a big and vocal 
advocate for us when we were 
in prison, but after we were 
released, he became a friend, and 
he was an incredible source of 
advice and inspiration.”
The formal event ended with 
recognition of Emilio Gutiérrez 
Soto, a Mexican journalist in 
the University’s Knight-Wallace 
Fellowship program. Gutiérrez 
was recently denied asylum in 
the U.S., despite his fear for his 
safety upon returning to Mexico 
because of his reporting on 
crimes committed by members 
of the military in Chihuahua, 
Mexico.
At 
the 
event, 
McCarren 
welcomed Gutiérrez onto the 

stage and presented him with 
an honorary membership to the 
National Press Club, created for 
honoring outstanding journalists. 
An emotional Gutiérrez stood 
before a standing ovation from 
the audience as he received the 
recognition.
“We have never extended 
this honor to an international 
journalist, someone who is not a 
U.S. citizen, and we want to do 
that today for Emilio Gutiérrez,” 
McCarren said while presenting 
the membership. “We want him 
to be one of our group, and to be 
one of that special group within 
our group.”
Abedi 
described 
the 
importance of students learning 
about different cultures through 
the experiences of journalists 
such as Gutiérrez and Rezaian, 
and how understanding these 
experiences can help spread 
awareness globally.
“It’s important to highlight the 
different parts of the world you 
may not understand,” Abedi said. 
“For instance, I think Iran is a 
beautiful country. I’ve been there, 
I love so many parts of Iranian 
culture, but unfortunately, the 
government and the treatment 
of its citizens isn’t always just. I 
think it’s important for students 
to see the inner workings of other 
countries and firsthand accounts 
of what people have done in order 
to raise awareness throughout 
the world.”

M

ost know the dangers 
climate change poses 
to both our present and 

future, but I will give 
a refresher. We are 
already experiencing 
its impacts. Climate 
change 
exacerbated 

the drought in the 
Middle 
East 
that 

partly 
caused 
the 

Syrian 
Civil 
War, 

increased 
the 

frequency 
of 
the 

wildfires that ravaged 
California 
in 
the 

fall and one intergovernmental 
report found climate change 
causes 
400,000 
premature 

deaths every year.

That is just the tip of the 

proverbial 
(melting) 
iceberg. 

The Paris climate accord urged 
governments to collaborate to 
keep long-term global warming 
below 1.5 degrees Celsius, but 
reaching that goal is becoming 
a pipe dream. With 2 degrees 
Celsius of warming (the Paris 
climate 
accord’s 
catastrophe 

threshold), 
98 
percent 
of 

coral reefs will die, sea levels 
will rise by approximately 50 
centimeters 
(displacing 
more 

than a billion people by 2060), 
the Mediterranean region will 
have 17 percent less freshwater 
available and heat waves could 
increase. But now, 2 degrees 
of warming is looking like a 
relatively positive outcome.

Pledging to get to these 

thresholds 
is 
meaningless 

without actually taking action. 
Right now we are more on course 
for long-term warming in the 
range of 3.1 to 3.7 degrees Celsius, 
according to Climate Action 
Tracker. There are few estimates 
that translate these predictions 
into direct loss of human life, but 
if we are experiencing 400,000 
premature deaths with barely 
1 degree of warming, nearly 4 
degrees will be Armageddon.

That all of these outcomes 

are rough estimates is part of 
the problem. Climate change 
will bring about continuous, 
unpredictable 
and 
dangerous 

change — a complete loss of 
normality for the rest of our 
and our children’s lives. And all 
of these impacts have and will 
continue to disproportionately 
impact people of color, low income 
and working class communities, 
women, LGBTQ individuals and 
indigenous communities. 

These 
global 
challenges 

are so daunting that it is hard 
to know how to start trying to 
fight them. This Friday’s Global 
Climate Strike may be the last, 
best chance we have to broadcast 
student voices around climate 
action. 

The Global Climate Strike is 

being led by high school students 
around the world. This wave 
of activism began with Greta 
Thunberg, a 16-year-old Swedish 
activist, who has skipped school 
every Friday since August to 
demand the Swedish Parliament 
uphold its commitments to the 

Paris agreement. Her movement 
has spread around the world, 
and tens of thousands of students 

will be walking out of 
classes on Friday to 
protest global leaders’ 
failure to adequately 
address 
climate 

change.

It 
is 
important 

that everyone walks 
out of class on Friday 
at 11:11 a.m., comes to 
the subsequent rally 
at 12 p.m. on the Diag, 
and to the march at 1 

p.m. because climate organizing 
of this magnitude does not 
happen often. The last march 
of this size was in 2015, when 
more than 600,000 people took 
to the streets in 175 countries 
around the world to push for a 
strong Paris agreement. If we 
wait another four years before 
making our voices heard, it will 
be too late. The most recent 
Intergovernmental 
Panel 
on 

Climate Change report called 
for 
dramatic 
reductions 
in 

greenhouse gas emissions by 
2030. We simply cannot afford to 
wait another four years.

While this strike will not 

have the same numbers as the 
2015 march did, it could be 
more powerful. Striking is more 
powerful than marching because 
it shows that we are willing to lose 
something to make our voices 
heard, even if that something 
is as trivial as lab attendance or 
iClicker points.

Furthermore, while in 2015 

we were marching to show 
world leaders that we wanted 
an ambitious plan for global 
emissions reductions, now we are 
calling out leaders for failing to 
deliver on their promises. Hence, 
this strike is not organized 
by 
established 
environmental 

organizations and leaders; it is led 
by high school students inciting 
grassroots organizing around 
the world. Our claims have more 
urgency and more authority now 
than they did four years ago.

This strike is also important 

because we need to play our 
part by taking responsibility to 
influence the decision-making of 
the institutions we are a part of. 
If we do not actively try to change 
our institutions, we are complicit 
in their inaction. Conveniently, 
this strike comes at a critical 
juncture for our institutions at 
multiple levels. The University 
of Michigan, Ann Arbor, the 
state of Michigan and the entire 
United States all face critical 
climate decisions in the coming 
months that we have the power 
to influence.

First, 
 
the 
 
University. 

President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

just 
created 
the 
President’s 

Commission 
on 
Carbon 

Neutrality, 
tasked 
with 

recommending 
emissions 

goals for the University. The 
commission’s members need to 
know that students recognize 
the existential threat climate 
change poses to our futures, so 

they act urgently to make the 
University carbon neutral by 
2030. But the University needs 
to know that how they get to 
carbon neutrality is important 
too; purchasing carbon offsets 
allows the University to continue 
burning 
fossil 
fuels 
without 

accountability, while expanding 
the new Central Power Plant will 
bind the University’s hands in an 
enormous investment that will 
entrench our reliance on fossil 
fuels.

In 
Ann 
Arbor, 
city 

councilmembers are considering 
abandoning climate action. In 
November 2017, voters agreed 
to devote 40 percent of a new 
millage 
to 
climate 
action, 

including the creation of a 
sustainability office, as part of a 
larger plan that set how the city 
would use the money. However, 
new city councilmembers want 
to nullify the resolution without 
an alternative plan for climate 
action funding.

Last month, the Republican 

Michigan 
legislature 
rejected 

Gov. 
Gretchen 
Whitmer’s 

executive order to strengthen the 
Department of Environmental 
Quality by giving it greater 
oversight over water pollution.

Nationally, 
our 
two 

Democratic senators, Gary Peters 
and Debbie Stabenow, have not 
signed on to the Green New 
Deal, the ambitious framework 
for addressing climate change 
recently proposed in the Senate.

While 
a 
massive 
strike 

may 
not 
directly 
lead 
to 

climate action from any or all 
of 
our 
representatives, 
our 

demonstrations 
matter. 
By 

showing we are willing to take 
risks and that we actively care 
about climate and our futures, 
our demands for climate action 
will be taken more seriously.

In his terrifying article on 

worst-case 
climate 
scenarios, 

David Wallace-Wells mentions 
how Jim Hansen, one of the first 
influential 
climate 
scientists, 

criticized 
environmental 

scientists 
for 
“scientific 

reticence” — they knew climate 
change was an issue, but were 
not bold enough to declare it 
an 
unambiguous 
crisis. 
The 

University, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 
the U.S. and countries around the 
world are performing their own 
institutional reticence. They are 
taking it slow or doing nothing 
at all when it is essential to take 
dramatic action right now.

It should be unacceptable 

for any of our institutions or

slow-walking the process of

But our voices are made more

MARIA ULAYYET | COLUMN

We must come back to our true roots on activism
A 

fellow 
writer 
recently 

wrote a column with an 
 
 
 
 
 

interesting perspective on 

student activism and divestment 
that inspired me to give our campus 
community a quick history lesson. 
This column commandeered the 
impact of the late Martin Luther 
King Jr. in an attempt to highlight 
the need to practice activism to fight 
for the “outsider.” It is insulting to 
use King’s legacy to memorialize 
oppression as is done in the column. 
King himself was placed on an 
“enemies of the United States” 
list that included terrorists, spies 
or anyone the FBI perceived as a 
threat. Historic movements are 
seldom popular in the present and 
we only celebrate King now after 
years of a low approval rating.

The passion behind this piece 

truly struck me and also inspired 
me to dispel the misconceptions on 
campus and beyond surrounding 
divestment 
and 
the 
conflict 

between Israel and Palestine. Just 
as many rightfully possess a deep 
love and loyalty to their Jewish 
roots, I urge people to consider the 
sense of devotion that Palestinian-
Americans owe to their roots as 
well.

The 
on-campus 
push 
for 

divestment campaigns stems from a 
passion for human rights — not anti-
Semitism.

The 
Boycott, 
Divestment, 

Sanctions (BDS) movement is 
referenced as “hate-filled,” in the 
column. As a form of nonviolent 
pressure 
on 
Israel, 
the 
BDS 

movement 
calls 
for 
boycotts 

against Israeli and international 
companies involved in the violation 
of Palestinian rights. Divestment 
campaigns urge the withdrawal 
of investments from companies 
involved in the Israeli violation 
of 
Palestinian 
human 
rights, 

encouraging 
sanctions 
to 

pressure governments to fulfill 
their obligations to hold Israel 
accountable for its violations of 
international agreements. Today, 
movements 
are 
decentralized 

with millions of participants, and 
thus it is impossible to credit such 
movements to a few individuals. 
Categorically calling out a few 
people on behalf of an entire group, 
as is done in the article, is racism 
in and of itself. According to the 
movement’s official website, the 
BDS movement “works to end 
international support for Israel’s 
oppression of Palestinians and 
pressure Israel to comply with 
international law.”

The author goes on to refer to 

the Middle East as a sea of “illiberal 
theocracies and failed states.” 
However, the author does not put 
this in its proper context, thereby 
failing to give justice to the complex 
history of the region. Unlike Israel, 

the Arab countries share the 
characteristic of being post-colonial 
and are still suffering from the 
remnants of imperialism. The CIA 
has also openly interfered in Middle 
Eastern elections repeatedly, which 
has severely impeded their ability 
to form effective democracies. The 
support of the United States and 
other Western powers via aid to the 
Middle East has curtailed anything 
related to democratic reform, as the 
U.S. would rather work with puppet 
dictatorships instead of independent 
democratic governments.

A democracy is defined as “a 

country in which power is held 
by elected representatives.” Just 
because Israel is a country that 
elects its own officials and is a 
“democracy” by definition does 
not mean that it is a nation of equal 
rights for all, nor that is not in 
violation of international law.

The BDS movement is presented 

as looking away from the “real evil,” 
but what about the tangible policies 
that Israel implements and that place 
a barrier on other human beings? 
Currently, Israel is in breach of 
more than 30 UN Security Council 
resolutions for actions including 
the installment of concrete walls, 
military watchtowers, barbed wire 
fences on Palestinian land, as well as 
ethnic cleansing, which primarily 
consisted of the forced removal of 
700,000 Palestinians and the illegal 
annexation of East Jerusalem and 
the Syrian Golan Heights. Which is 
really the “real evil”?

Furthermore, 
the 
Israel 

Defense Forces has functioned 
under the Dahiya Doctrine, in 
which it views civilian villages as 
military bases and justifies the use 
of disproportionate forces in such 
civilian areas. Israeli authorities 
have also been found to allow 
pharmaceutical companies to test 
weapons and drugs on Palestinian 
and Arab prisoners and children. 
The idea of harnessing such 
disproportionate force dangerously 
mirrors the principle of Manifest 
Destiny implemented by the United 
States that saw the genocide of 
Native Americans. Israel continues 
their version of Manifest Destiny 
today by building more than 1,000 
homes for Jewish settlements on 
Palestinian land.

These 
injustices 
are 
the 

exact types of issues that should 
be combated through student 
activism. As mentioned in my fellow 
columnist’s piece, Martin Luther 
King Jr.’s words “remind us all 
that it is our duty to stand against 
injustice, wherever it may exist” and 
that “none of us can sit idly by while 
our fellow members of humankind 
are denied their God-given rights.” I 
agree with the reverend and believe 
that my fellow columnist and I both 
have a shared mission towards 

peace and equality. The Palestinian 
people’s drive for equality mirrors 
the “outsider” feeling embodied by 
the African-American community 
during the civil rights movement. 
The mission of movements such as 
BDS centered around human rights 
serves as a student’s outlet to stand 
against the injustices imposed by 
the Israeli government onto the 
Palestinian people.

Peaceful 
coexistence 
is 

unfortunately not the reality in 
Israel. In the case of the Arab-
Israelis that are referenced as 
“equals,” a recent Pew Research 
Center study found that 79 percent 
of Jewish Israelis believe that they 
should have preferential treatment 
over Arabs and that nearly half 
agreed “Arabs should be expelled or 
transferred from Israel.” Currently, 
thousands of Palestinians must 
go 
through 
Israeli 
military 

checkpoints, where they wait from 
3 in the morning or earlier to secure 
a place in “cage-like lines” to Israeli 
and Palestinian cities beyond the 
Green Line, simply to go to work 
every day.

Palestinian and Arab-American 

students alike here at the University 
of Michigan possess a care for the 
rights of their people and showcased 
this 
through 
the 
#UMDivest 

campaign. The campaign was 
simply intended to investigate 
alleged human rights violations 
committed by companies operating 
in Israel and urge the withdrawal of 
investments in companies involved 
in such violations. The movement 
by no means sought to propagate 
hate-filled rhetoric toward Jewish 
people or Israel as a country, but 
rather serves to provide a voice 
to the marginalized Palestinian 
community.

Ignoring the state of the 

Palestinians 
and 
Arab-Israelis 

who are treated like second-class 
citizens is inhumane. Securing 
the freedom of some at the cost 
of others’ rights is hypocritical. 
Claiming anti-Semitism as a factor 
for all movements detracts from 
the discussion of human rights 
issues that are occurring. There is a 
historically emotional undertone to 
the anger within these movements, 
and this stems from the pain of 
decades of such abuses. This is 
the pain that Palestinian and 
Palestinian-American students face 
and deal with.

I urge students to continue 

using their passionate voices to 
fight against the inequality and 
injustice they see and I hope we can 
all eventually see eye to eye in the 
search for peace through student 
activism.

TARA JAYARAM | OP-ED

I

magine you’re driving in 
London or New York, 
inching slowly through 

patience-testing traffic. You 
look to your left, peer into the 
car next to you, and see that 
there’s no one there. You look 
to the other side and notice 
there’s no one inside the car 
to your right either. This is 
a future we can expect: rows 
of driverless gridlock, empty 
cars 
slowly 
roaming 
the 

city, dutifully cruising until 
their owners get out of work, 
all in the name of avoiding 
expensive 
urban 
parking 

fees.

In a recent publication 

in Transport Policy, Adam 
Millard-Ball 
and 
his 

colleagues at the University 
of 
California, 
Santa 

Cruz 
illustrate 
possible 

alternatives that autonomous 
vehicles can use instead of 
parking. 

Society 
doesn’t 
seem 

to have made up its mind 
on 
autonomous 
vehicles. 

According to a Pew Research 
Center 
study, 
Americans 

are both enthusaistic and 
worried about their adoption. 
In academia, scientists have 
split opinions on whether 

future driverless cars will 

positively or negatively affect 
the environment. On the one 
hand, driverless cars fuel 
urban sprawl, but since their 
design 
optimizes 
spatial 

efficiency, they are also seen 
as an opportunity to redesign 
cities to promote walking and 
cycling.

In the face of future 

ambiguity, 
there 
is 
one 

clear 
consequence 
of 
the 

adoption 
of 
autonomous 

vehicles: the effect on traffic. 
An 
inevitable 
but 
rarely 

addressed aspect of these 
cars is their ability to bypass 
expensive parking fees in 
ways 
that 
increase 
drive 

times and worsen already 
rising urban congestion.

One option is to send the 

car home after the passenger 
is dropped off. While this 
may seem like a harmless 
high tech chauffeur, there 
are distinct environmental 
costs to this practice. The 
number of trips the car takes 
is doubled, resulting in more 
congestion and more vehicle 
emissions per person.

Another, 
more 
eerie 

option, is called cruising. 
After 
the 
passenger 
is 

dropped off, the car drives 
around the city as slowly as 
possible so as to minimize 
fuel costs. Instinctively, the 
cost of driving all day seems 
higher than parking in a 
city. But Millard-Ball’s study 
found that it is by far cheaper 
than parking, costing less 
than 50 cents per hour in 
contrast to the $4 per hour 
cost of parking in many large 
cities.

Also, when multiple cars 

engage in cruising, each with 
the incentive to go as slowly 
as possible, the chance of 
gridlock 
is 
high. 
Picture 

hundreds, even thousands of 
cars, sitting in the middle of 
residential streets, waiting 
patiently 
for 
the 
return 

of their owners. Even in 
relatively 
small 
numbers, 

less than 4,000 autonomous 
vehicles are needed to slow 
some streets down to under 
two kilometers per hour.

This 
traffic 
nightmare 

comes with a breath of solace 
in its possible solutions. Free 
or 
subsidized 
peripheral 

parking, 
similar 
to 
the 

cell phone parking lots in 
airports, can encourage more 
sharing of AVs and limit 
congestion within cities.

It has also added credence 

to 
the 
proposition 
of 

municipal congestion pricing, 
a policy that has also been 
proposed as a response to 
the increased traffic caused 
by ride-sharing companies 
like Uber and Lyft. Without 
the 
offset 
of 
congestion 

pricing, cities stand to lose 
a significant portion of their 
municipal 
revenue 
from 

the 
decrease 
in 
parking 

popularity. For example, in 
2016, New York City made 
$545 million in parking fines, 
a significant potential loss if 
not remedied by the approval 
of congestion charges.

While the adoption of 

autonomous vehicles seems 
inevitable, we can’t know 
exactly how our cities will 
look 
when 
autonomous 

vehicles gain popularity. We 
can only hope that the traffic 
they bring doesn’t add to our 
road rage.

Ghost traffic, a driverless problem


The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
Arts
Wednesday, March 13, 2019 — 5A

In the next week, the Book Review 
will be featuring works from Gimmick 
Press, a independent publisher of niche 
literature and art based in Detroit, 
Michigan. Gimmick was established 
in 2015 by Josh Olsen and Katie 
MacDonald with a commitment to 
diversity and inclusion of both subject 
matter and voice throughout all aspects 
of their work. Gimmick publishes 
digitally through “Worthless Treasures” 
and calls for printed chapbook and 
anthology submissions throughout 
the year. They’re currently accepting 
submissions for an anthology of 
creative nonfiction about pop culture 
obsessions.
I find it necessary to preface 
this: I don’t have much experience 
reviewing poetry. I’ve spent most 
of my time with nonfiction, the 
remainder with fiction and poetry 
only when a particular poet has been 
introduced to me within a larger 
academic context or a stroke of luck 
brought me their way. So I enter this 
reflection on Mark James Andrews’s 
“Motor City is Burning” by defining 
it as exactly that — a reflection, 
not a review. Which is fitting, in 
the end, because this collection is 
much more about evoking a sense 
of place rather than challenging and 
advancing the contemporary canon. 
And that place is the grimy, Beatnik 
basements 
scattered 
throughout 
Detroit during the ’60s and ’70s. It is 
the rock ‘n’ roll, blues-laden scenes and 
rioting in the streets that lit Detroit 
on fire during a tumultuous era in our 
country’s history.
We identify and recall beat poetry 
based on its distinct, mythologized 
features and the lifestyle it inspired: a 
dirty and progressive use of language, 
the flagrant abuse of drugs and alcohol 
and a privileged assumption of anti-
materialism and counterculture ideas. 
Andrews’s collection is reminiscent 
of the beat style, and self-aware in its 
endeavor: In the poem “Words Can’t 
Describe,” Andrews writes “I lifted 
my pages off the green felt and began 
to chant / my own personal Howl / 
derivative to be sure but I was pure and 
sincere / and the young crowd was with 
me.” Most of the poems unfold like this, 
following a stream of consciousness 
rhythm, written as if Andrews couldn’t 
get the words out of his mouth and onto 
the page fast enough. They all contain 
this performative air, meant only to 

be read to an audience at Dick’s Bar or 
Samsara Lounge — settings for many of 
these poems.
Often enough though I find that it’s 
easy to confuse good poetry with a 
confident speaker. And much of a beat 
poet’s allure is in their delivery, their 
undeniable style. This is what I think 
about when I read Andrews’ poetry, 
how, were I seated before him at Dick’s 
Bar listening to him perform in a daze 
of smoke and a cloud of alcohol, I could 
be swayed by it. But on the page, in 
2019, these poems seem anachronistic. 
Even when he’s talking about current 

events, a suicide on Belle Isle Bridge, 
the language harkens back to a style 
and demographic from which poetry 
has distanced itself. And it’s one reason 
I cringe when reading some of these 
poems.
I’m not sure sincerity is enough to 
compensate for the derivative nature 
of them, the feeling that, because I’ve 
read Ginsberg and Thompson and 
Burroughs, I’ve read Andrews before. 
And I’m not sure sincerity makes the 
heady sexual imagery of some of these 
poems any easier to swallow. Perhaps 
one of the most explicit examples 
of this is an excerpt from the poem 
“Rusty Cage,” which seems to take 
place in a strip club or cabaret: “I’m 
waiting for the next one / a stunning 
amazon / lanky, goofy, sneaky pretty 
/ bare midriff top. / I hope her gig is a 
belly dance / or anything with a little 
bravery.”
Given the opportunity to briefly 
glance over the collection, anyone can 
notice the prefuse objectification of the 

female body employed in many of these 
poems (I gave it to a co-worker and 
they commented on it, unprovoked). 
Because, of course, with the tradition 
of this era and its poetry comes the 
tradition of extraneous sexual imagery, 
often to the detriment of the female 
body (The poem “Revolution” opens 
with the statement that “Revolution 
was about pussy / more pussy / strange 
pussy / better drugs”). The narrator 
dismisses the ’60s revolutionaries in 
this poem, as he gazes upon the Occupy 
Detroit protesters in the park. But with 
the employment of over-sexualized 
language and a kind of bebop 
rhythm, he still romanticizes this 
era and draws us back to it.
“Satan bebopped into Detroit / 
with a wad that would choke / The 
Four Horseman of the Apocalypse 
/ with a Saturday Night Special,” 
begins the poem “Boom Boom.” 
Each poem in the collection is 
dedicated to a different rock or 
blues musician. “Boom Boom,” 
dedicated to John Lee Hooker, 
is more straightforward in its 
dedication than the rest, seeming to 
narrate a bit of Hooker’s importance 
in the Detroit jazz scene. But this 
connection between dedication and 
content is hard to locate in many of 
the poems. Most serve a symbolic 
purpose, anchoring the poem in 
time and memory, making them only 
accessible for those familiar with 
the musician or a specific historical 
instance. His use of allusions do this 
as well, especially in “Boom Boom” 
where the substance of the poem is 
weighed down by references lost on me 
and, I’m sure, other readers.
The strongest poems in “Motor City 
is Burning” are the ones that both speak 
to a unique experience and don’t sink 
under the weight of history. “Looking 
at You,” dedicated to Wayne Kramer 
& MC5, is one of these. Recounting 
the night he saw MC5 play The Magic 
Stick, Andrews moves from a party 
on one end of Detroit to the crowded 
floor beneath the stage, and captures 
the rush of excitement and adrenaline 
that pushes a night forward from one 
place to the next before ending, in this 
case, “with a mic upper-cut popping 
my chin” as the narrator stood in front 
of the stage. There are moments in this 
poem where the sincerity Andrews 
speaks of in “Words Can’t Describe” 
break through gauzy descriptions and 
reach the surface. Moments like small 
children waving “as if our passing was 
an event / and I felt foolish just for a 
minute.”

‘Motor City’ needs a Tylenol

I really cannot stand Billy 
Joel.
Granted, there are a lot of 
artists I dislike, but none of 
their music is as pervasive and 
unavoidable as his. Billy Joel 
reaches for both the everyman 
charm of Bruce Springsteen 
and the campy virtuosity of 
Elton John however, he misses 
both marks, falling flat on his 
face in the middle.
Billy Joel is no stranger to 
lukewarm critical reception — 
when asked about the critics 
in a 1982 interview with 
Playboy, 
Billy 
responded: 
“What they say has absolutely 
no effect on me! I really don’t 
care what they say. It doesn’t 
bother me. It’s irrelevant!” 
He has been known to rip up 
negative reviews on stage 
during his concerts, which is a 

great way of showing that you 
are definitely not mad.
Let’s move to his actual 
music, beginning with the 
mawkish 
piece 
of 
work 
that is “Piano Man”: The 
narrative is centered around 
the perspective of a dive bar 
musician who describes the 
lonely 
clientele 
that 
pass 
through on a Saturday night. 
Like almost all his songs, the 
central character, in this case 
the “piano man,” is a hammed-
up version of himself. While 
masquerading as a portrait 
of the common man, the song 
does 
not 
actually 
explore 
the emotional world of the 
patrons in any way, the only 
real observation being that 
they are lonely and dream 
of a better life. Instead, the 
narrative turns on how much 
they all come together to 
enjoy the music of ... Billy 
Joel. Likewise, any attempts 
he 
makes 
at 
empathy 
or 

insight are painfully banal; 
take “The Stranger”: “Well, 
we all have a face that we hide 
away forever / And we take 

them out and show ourselves 
when everyone has gone.”
A lot of Billy’s stories, 
much like “Piano Man,” seem 
to focus on how effortlessly 

cool he is. In the Playboy 
interview, he tells this one: 
“I was in Turin for this press 
conference 
and 
this 
well-
dressed journalist with wing-
tip shoes from a left-wing 
paper asked, ‘Why did you 
play Israel?’ He was trying to 
create controversy. I said, ‘I 
played in Israel for the same 
reason I played in Cuba — to 
play for the people. We wanted 
to see what the people in Israel 
were like instead of listening 
to the propaganda we get in 
our country.’ The people at the 
press conference stood up and 
clapped.” This anecdote could 
come straight from a chain 
email circa 2005, right down 
to everyone in room standing 
up and clapping for him. He 
tells a very similar story about 
a show in Cuba as well — his 
self-aggrandizement 
is 
not 
constrained by petty politics! 
Let’s also look at the “A 
Matter of Trust” music video. 
It consists of Billy and his 
backing 
band 
performing 
an 
open-air 
basement 
concert 
while 
onlookers 
slowly congregate, the event 
eventually 
turning 
into 
an 
impromptu 
concert. 
If 

this sounds familiar, that’s 
because it’s almost exactly the 
same concept as The Beatles’s 
famous 
rooftop 
concert, 
except Billy Joel is under the 

building instead of on top of 
it.
Specifically, 
his 
feeble 
attempts 
to 
emulate 
the 
irreverent 
and 
mischievous 
public 
persona 
of The Beatles 
come across as 
arrogant. 
In 
regard 
to 
his 
experience with 
The 
Beatles, 
Billy 
says, 
“They don’t look 
like they were 
manufactured 
in 
Hollywood. 
They look just 
like me and my 
friends. I could 
see this look in 
John 
Lennon’s 
eyes 
that 
told 
me 
something: 
They 
were 
irreverent, they 
were 
making 
fun of the whole 
thing. 
It 
was 
this smirk on his 
face. They were 
a bunch of wise 
guys 
like 
me 
and my friends! That’s when 
it all took shape. I said, 
‘That’s what I want to do.’” 
The problem with this is that 
Billy Joel, like most people, is 
much, much, worse at being 
a wise guy than any of The 
Beatles.
He 
paints 
himself 
as 
beleaguered by cultural elites 
at every turn — he’s just trying 
to be Billy and they won’t let 
him! And you know what? 
He’s not totally wrong. A lot 
of the criticism of Billy comes 
from a place of condescension 
— he is perceived by critics as 
middlebrow and uncool. This 
is a correct perception, but 
such criticism merely feeds 
into his desire to be perceived 
as the scrappy underdog who 
doesn’t care what the haut 
monde has to say about him. 
Of course, this image does not 

square with the fact that he is 
one of the best-selling artists 
of all time, has five Grammys, 
and as of last summer, Jul. 18 in 
New York state 
is 
henceforth 
to be known as 
“Billy Joel Day.” 
Thanks, Andrew 
Cuomo.
There 
are 

plenty 
of 

musicians 
who 
don’t 
really 
offer 
much 
of 
substance 
but 
are 
pleasant 
nonetheless 
because 
they 
create 
well-
constructed, 
consumable art. 
There’s nothing 
wrong with that! 
What 
makes 
Billy 
so 
much 
more 
offensive 
is that a large 
part 
of 
his 
brand is based 
on a supposed 
authenticity, 
when in reality 
his appeals to 
“man of the people” imagery 
are a cynical, self-serving act.
When asked how he would 
define rock ‘n’ roll, Billy said, 
“It’s music that has passion 
in it, whether it’s a ballad or 
whatever. There’s some kind 
of 
intensity.” 
Aside 
from 
being a terrible attempt at 
defining 
rock 
music, 
that 
answer explains a lot of the 
lurid melodrama Billy shoves 
into his tunes. Billy is keenly 
aware 
of 
what 
signifies 
“meaning” in music and takes 
advantage of these tropes to 
create a veneer of poignancy. 
It is a hollow imitation. It 
is 
the 
Applebee’s 
of 
pop 
music, a tepid microwaved 
repackaging of actual musical 
expression, and it deserves 
little more than contempt.
I do think “Vienna” is a 
good song, though.

I loathe Billy Joel. Here’s
why this is not a problem.

COLUMBIA RECORDS

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

Clocking in at three hours and nine 
minutes, “Never Look Away” is an epic 
journey through the life of Kurt Barnert 
(Tom Schilling, “A Coffee in Berlin”), 
a young artist seeking to find his sense 
of self through art. His youth was 
influenced by World War II — his aunt 
Elisabeth (Saskia Rosendahl, “Lore”) 
was sterilized and euthanized by a Nazi 
doctor due to her “mild schizophrenia.” 
When 
we 
first 
meet 
Kurt 
and 
Elisabeth, 
he 
is 
five or six years old 
and she is taking 
him to the famous 
1937 
“Degenerate 
Art” 
exhibition 
in Dresden — one 
of 
the 
greatest 
exhibitions 
of 
modern 
art 
in 
history. It is here 
where 
Elisabeth 
tells Kurt to “never 
look 
away” 
as 
“everything 
true 
is beautiful.” Kurt 
never forgets these 
words, 
and 
the 
loss of his aunt 
affects him deeply. 
Raised 
in 
East 
Germany, 
Kurt 
attends art school 
in Dresden. There, he meets his wife 
Ellie 
(Paula 
Beer, 
“Transit”) 
with 
whom he ultimately leaves for the West. 
Despite rising above his classmates, he 
is restricted by the prescriptive nature 
of Socialist realism. Kurt desires a 
greater artistic freedom, which he finds 
in Dusseldorf. Throughout the film, we 
see how World War II affected Germany, 
personally and societally. Directed by 
Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck 
(“The Lives of Others”), “Never Look 
Away” addresses the war with brutal 
honesty, reminding viewers of the 
Nazi slaughter of non-Jewish Germans 
with mental illness and “undesirable 
genetics.” Von Donnersmarck based this 
film on the life of German artist Gerhard 
Richter. The biographical accuracy has 
been debated, but the similarities remain 
unquestioned. Kurt’s ultimate artistic 
style is very Richter-esque; some of the 
works Kurt paints in the movie are direct 
references to Richter’s works.

This film is remarkably moving. Von 
Donnersmarck’s treatment of the war 
is raw. One particularly disturbing 
and somber scene, in which mentally 
ill women walk into a gas chamber to 
be euthanized, provokes a melancholy 
feeling of profound disgust. The film 
addresses life and death, particularly 
how living and dying affects those around 
us. Mother and child, birth and loss, 
creation and destruction. The viewer 
is engaged for every minute of the film; 
every scene adds to Kurt’s intricately 
layered history. 
This is not your 
average biopic.
Despite 
the 
intense 
and 
artfully 
woven 
plot, 
the 
film 
would not be as 
moving without 
its 
remarkable 
score. Composed 
by Max Richter, 
the 
wonderful 
music 
elevates 
the film. It is 
fluid, 
powerful 
and 
engaging. 
I 
am 
always 
drawn 
to 
repeated motifs, 
small 
visual 
moments which 
tie 
characters 
and 
scenes 
together. “Never 
Look Away” features a few of these, 
most notably Elisabeth and Kurt’s 
separate moments of aural rapture: 
An 
unexpected 
mechanical 
chorus 
provides the blank canvas from which 
Max Richter’s score erupts, sending 
chills down the viewer’s spine. In “Never 
Look Away,” film meets music meets 
painting to create a portrait of human 
suffering 
and 
flourishing. 
Growth, 
decay, regrowth — this arc emerges in 
Kurt and Ellie’s passionate romance, 
in Kurt’s art and in the career of Ellie’s 
father. I would say Von Donnersmarck 
paints a portrait himself, of being human 
in the face of inhumanity. This is not 
your average World War II film, either. 
Von Donnersmarck gives the viewer an 
intimate look into mid- and post-War 
Germany. It is a film about passion and 
perseverance. The viewer is ultimately 
reminded to appreciate art and love 
wholeheartedly, for how else are we to 
cope with life and loss?

‘Never Look Away’ is
a portrait on beauty

With last week’s release of 
the much anticipated trailer for 
Season 8 of the HBO megahit 
“Game of Thrones,” one thing 
is clear: The end is near. After 
eight seasons, almost 10 years, 
and more than two decades of 
waiting for George R.R. Martin 
to pull his story together, the 
Westerosi Saga will finally reach 
it’s end. Or at least, it will reach 
an end.
As anyone who has become 
wrapped up in this tale of 
zombies and dragons knows, 
author George R.R. Martin is 
nowhere close to completing his 
“Song of Ice and Fire” novels 
upon which the show is based. 
The most recent book, “A Dance 
With Dragons” was published 
the same summer the HBO show 
first premiered, back in 2011. 
Since then, the showrunners 
have adapted and then expanded 
upon 
Martin’s 
work, 
going 
beyond the narrative established 
in the novels and crafting their 
own material beyond the source. 
Many believe that the show has 
dipped in quality since passing 
the material in Martin’s original 
books.
However, the truth is that 
the show has simply shifted in 
structure and in subject matter. 
Where the early seasons and 
novels focused on the intricate 
political 
intrigue 
between 
the various forces of Stark, 
Lannister, Tyrell, Bolton and 
other houses vying for control 
of the Iron Throne, later seasons 
have slowly pruned the narrative 
excess, eventually bringing the 
battle against the White Walkers 
into sharp focus as the central 
conflict of the series. What 
began as “House of Cards” with 
dragons has become “Lord of 
the Rings” with nudity. Whether 
or not that bothers you is up to 
the individual viewer. Whether 
or not that was always going to 
be the case, and whether or not 
Martin intended to make the 
same kind of pivot in his novels, 
is unclear.
Six episodes. A little more 
or less than an hour each. 
That’s all that the “Game of 
Thrones” creators and writers 
have to wrap up one of the most 

sprawling fantasy epics of all 
time. Despite the work done 
in the past few years to prune 
away the fat from the show’s 
cast, dozens of characters still 
exist whose storylines need 

to be brought to something 
resembling resolution. But what 
kind of resolution can possibly 
satisfy the legions of fans that 
have spent in some cases their 
entire lives speculating about 
how this is all going to end? 
Just ask the people behind the 
“LOST” finale — it’s not easy to 
end a mythology-heavy show. If 
Daenerys or Jon Snow take the 
crown and sit the Iron Throne, 
will that feel earned or will 
it feel cheap? If both die and 
another takes the seat, will it 
come off to audiences as a cop 
out? Is there any way to still 
shock an audience that expects 
to be shocked at every turn? 
Is it a little bit lame that the 
ultimate “no good guys, no bad 
guys” show is going to end with 
an army of good guys against an 
army of faceless CGI zombies? I 
don’t know the answers. But, the 
questions are real.
It 
seems 
inevitable 
that 
“Game of Thrones” Season 8 
will disappoint. How could it 
not? Nothing can ever live up to 
the individual expectations and 
desires that each viewer has in 
their own head. Not everyone’s 
favorite character will have 
enough screen time, not everyone 
will get a happy ending. Many 
book readers have all but given 
up on the show, and are just 

watching now to see how it all 
ends up. With such a contracted 
season coming almost 18 months 
after a sixth season that was 
also shorter than usual, the days 
of getting 10 straight weeks of 
“Game of Thrones” seem as far 
away as Ned Stark and Robert 
Baratheon.
Many have referred to “Game 
of Thrones” over the years as 
“The Last Water Cooler Show.” 
In the current age of diversified 
content 
and 
splintered 
viewership, it is becoming more 
and more difficult for shows 
to 
garner 
huge 
followings 
and break out of their niche. 
“Thrones” is one of the only 
shows that people still feel the 
need to watch in the moment, 
week to week, like a live sporting 
event. It came of age during “the 
golden age of TV” but it will 
leave as “the last of its kind.” 
Undoubtedly, 
imitators 
will 
come and go (Amazon is already 
planning the most expensive 
series of all time with their “Lord 
of the Rings” streaming show), 
but it seems highly unlikely that 
any show will shock the world as 
constantly and as consistently as 
“Game of Thrones” did. If it is the 
journey that is important, and 
not the destination, then “Game 
of Thrones” has already done 
more than enough to make its 
mark on the history of television. 
It’s one of those pieces of media, 
like “Harry Potter” and “Star 
Wars” before it, that ingrains 
itself so fully in your memories 
that you will never forget where 
you were when certain scenes 
hit you, nor will you forget 
the people you were with. As 
the next two months unfold, 
the death toll mounts and the 
nostalgic wave that comes with 
all endings sets in, it’s worth it 
to take a moment and remember 
how far we’ve come. Just like the 
Stark children, many of us have 
grown up with this show. Winter 
has at last come and will soon be 
gone. From George R.R. Martin, 
to the cast and crew of “Game of 
Thrones,” to the powerful spirit 
of imagination that has allowed 
this show to enchant audiences 
all over the world, may we all 
continue to dream for spring.

DAILY ENTERTAINMENT COLUMN

Can GoT’s end satisfy us?

Nearly 
two 
years 
have 
passed since I last listened to 
Weezer. At my worst, I was 
listening to “No Other One” 
no less than dozen times a day. 
I’d go weeks avoiding calls 
from my mother, huddled 
in the dark corner of my 
dorm room under an Edward 
Hopper “Nighthawks” print 
pressing 
play 
on 
“Why 
Bother?” My friends 
would ask where I 
was. I’d tell them I 
was too tired, too 
busy. And then, with 
great guilt but even 
greater pleasure, I’d 
resume “Say It Ain’t 
So.”
Since 
that 
rock 
bottom, I have had to 
seriously recalibrate 
myself. What are my 
priorities? Does my 
social 
circle 
have 
my best interests in 
mind? Who are my 
role models? Each 
day, each decision 
I have approached 
with 
a 
simple 
question: 
“Will 
it 
make me listen to Weezer 
again?” I have tried my best to 
live a life that, in aggregate, 
answers this question with a 
resounding no.
But because I am a selfless, 
giving, loving, effervescent 
person, I have decided, just 
this once — I swear — to 
relapse in the name of good 
journalism, and review the 
thirteenth album by the Los 
Angeles based emo-pop-rock 
band.
Weezer (“Black Album”) is 
their fifth self-titled album, 
in case you were forgetting 
what 
Rivers 
Cuomo 
calls 
his band, and their second 
album 
of 
2019, 
following 
Weezer 
(“Teal 
Album”), 
which included covers of 
Toto’s “Africa” and TLC’s 
“No Scrubs.” In the less than 
three months between the 
“Teal Album” and the “Black 

Album,” Weezer have yet 
again found the darkness: on 
the cover of the “Teal Album” 
the band dressed in fun, 
beachy attire. Here, they don 
full latex BDSM bodysuits.
But the latex suits are bit 
of a fake out. If you’re like 
me and have also gotten into 
hardcore BDSM and latex 
over the last three months, 
then you’ll be let down by the 
dissonance. These songs are 
not hardcore and abrasive, like 
some of their best and earliest 

material; instead, they lean 
heavily on a pop mentality 
that can be as annoying as 
it is fun. Nearly every track 
has the easily recognizable, 
repetitive nature of a radio 
pop song. “Can’t Knock the 
Hustle,” “Zombie Bastards” 
and “Living in L.A.” could 
all feasibly rotate on an FM 
station 
and 
you 
probably 
wouldn’t 
blink 
an 
eye. 
That’s not to say they’re not 
fun 
and 
catchy. 
“Zombie 
Bastards,” for example, is 
quite so. But none of the 
three are so memorable, and 
unfortunately, this applies 
to the majority of the album. 
Somehow Weezer has made 
even BDSM unexciting.
For better or worse, what 
once made Weezer so popular 
(and 
so 
addicting) 
was 
their ability to make songs 
about angst that sounded 

like 
angst. 
When 
they 
complained about sex and 
drugs and loneliness, they 
did it with guitar riffs that 
sounded just as disaffected 
and jaded as Cuomo. When 
Cuomo said he was “Tired 
of Sex,” you believed him, 
as embarrassing and angsty 
a sentiment that might be. 
Weezer was never afraid to 
sound like the feelings you 
weren’t supposed to have.
On Weezer (“Black Album”), 
the band hasn’t ditched its 
emotional core. The 
loneliness 
is 
still 
here (“But I feel so 
lonely, feel so lonely 
/ Uh, uh, yeah, I’m 
living in L.A”), as is 
the sex (“Like the 
sex appeal of your 
sick dance moves / 
Ooh, wee, ooh, wee”) 
and 
drugs 
(“Let’s 
do hard drugs / Fix 
our problems”). But 
those feelings are 
no longer tangible. 
Whether 
it’s 
the 
pop 
background, 
the 
proximity 
to 
an album with an 
“Africa” 
by 
Toto 
cover, or just that 
Cuomo 
is 
getting 
old, these songs speak of 
sadness but don’t feel like it.
Certainly, 
pop 
music 
can 
use 
the 
dissonance 
between sound and lyrics 
to 
an 
advantage. 
When 
done effectively, the song 
resonates more deeply, not 
less, like when Robyn sings 
of 
being 
alone 
over 
the 
uplifting beat of “Dancing 
On My Own.” But on Weezer 
(“Black Album”), the result 
is the opposite. Both the 
upbeat instrumentation and 
the lyrics feels performative, 
one trying to accomplish a 
different task than the other. 
If the “Black Album” leaves 
a mark, its only to remind 
me of the better, unhappier 
moments 
in 
Weezer’s 
discography, and the worse, 
unhappier moments my own 
musical progression. Here’s 
hoping we all get well again. 

Weezer’s latest goes dark

ALBUM REVIEW

MATTHEW GALLATIN
Daily Arts Writer

Weezer (‘Black 
Album’)

Weezer

Universal Music Group

The week in pop culture has been dominated 
by two profoundly disturbing stories: accounts 
of child sexual abuse perpetrated by music icons 
R. Kelly and Michael Jackson, whose alleged 
misdeeds were ignored for far too long, no doubt 
because it was much more convenient to enjoy 
the genius of “Ignition (Remix)” and “Billie 
Jean” at weddings and birthday parties than 
it was to confront those other ugly, distressing 
possibilities.
HBO’s “Leaving 
Neverland” — the 
Jackson 
exposé 
— and Lifetime’s 
“Surviving 
R. 
Kelly” both speak 
to the power of 
the 
televised 
documentary 
to 
change minds and 
fuel conversations. 
But the ensuing 
discourse 
has 
sometimes veered 
into unproductive 
and even malicious 
territory. On the 
tamer end are the 
circular, oft-hashed debates about separating art 
from the artist. At worst, though, the films have 
been met with a deluge of unhinged apologia. 
And amid the very fan-centric introspection, a 
clearer sense of how we might treat victims and 
deal with abusers in these situations still feels 
lacking.
Enter Oprah Winfrey and Gayle King, the 
trusted TV hosts and best friends, who both 
demonstrated a remarkable ability to take 
stock of horribly sad, fraught circumstances 
and treat them with nuance and care. Winfrey, 
herself a survivor of child sexual abuse, hosted 
an hour-long special following the “Leaving 
Neverland” premiere in which she interviewed 
the documentaries’ subjects, TK and TK, along 
with a child trauma psychologist and other 
victims-turned-advocates. A few days later 
on CBS, King sat down with R. Kelly in his 
first televised interview since the premiere of 
“Surviving R. Kelly.” Both women brought a 
deft, careful balance of compassion, composure 
and journalistic rigor.
Oprah’s was done in her signature group 

therapy style, weaving in personal reflections 
and audience input. The audience, it should be 
noted, was made up almost entirely of survivors, 
all of whom had just watched the 4-hour “Leaving 
Neverland.” Winfrey began the segment by 
noting that she had devoted over 200 episodes of 
“The Oprah Winfrey Show” to discussing sexual 
abuse, and her familiarity with the material 
shined through — her questions were informed 
and incisive, sometimes belaboring points to 
make the contours of the conversation clear 
to viewers while remaining respectful of the 
trauma victims she spoke with. All in all, it was 
low-key, 
subdued 
affair.
King’s was the 
more lurid of the 
two — maybe you’ve 
seen the myriad of 
clips or the GIFs by 
now. Surely, you’ve 
seen the photo: R. 
Kelly, on the verge 
of 
tears, 
sprung 
from his seat and 
Gayle King, leaning 
back 
in 
hers, 
with an unmoved 
expression 
that 
says, “It’s OK, I’ll 
wait.” It couldn’t 
have 
been 
easy 
to interview someone who looked like he 
could detonate at any moment, but she did it 
spectacularly, with focus and poise. And she 
navigated the interview with him and his 
zealous apologists in a way that let her emerge 
supremely level-headed by the segment’s end.
Neither spends much time on the question of 
separating the art from the artist — that’s the 
sort of thorny dilemma that doesn’t make for a 
compact primetime special. But what Winfrey 
and King both do well is to give their viewers 
the tools to make those decisions for themselves. 
And each host, in her own way, probes at the 
problem of fandom itself. We might not find 
ourselves grappling with “cancel culture” had 
we not filled celebrities with our own nostalgic 
attachments in the first place. What allowed 
Michael Jackson to ingratiate himself with his 
victims, Oprah explains, is the same thing that 
has kept his legacy mostly intact until now: He 
was Michael Jackson! He was God. She quotes 
a Maureen Dowd column that stuck with her: 
“How can you see clearly when you’re looking 
into the sun?”

First tough competition brings 
mixed results for Wolverines

When the No. 23 Michigan 
baseball team (9-4) hopped off 
their plane at LAX on Feb. 27, there 
were a lot of questions to answer. 
The Wolverines were undefeated. 
Their bats were hot. Their pitchers 
were dominant. But the only 
competition the Wolverines had 
faced were virtual pushovers in 
Binghamton and the Citadel. 
Michigan’s eight-game, ten-day 
California swing, in which it faced 
face California State-Northridge, 
California 
State-Long 
Beach, 
No. 25 University of California-
Irvine, No. 3 UCLA, Southern 
California, and No. 19 Oklahoma 
State, presented its first tough 
competition of the season.
The California trip now behind 
them, there are just as many 
question marks swirling around 
the Wolverines. They defeated 
Northridge handily in the first 
three games of the series, but 
dropped the fourth, suffering 
their first loss of the season. 
Michigan defeated UCLA, which 
Bakich called “maybe one of the 
best teams in the country,” but 
ended the trip on a two-game 
losing streak, falling to Southern 
California and Oklahoma State.
“We showed a little bit of 
everything on this trip, but as 
a position player group we had 
opportunities 
to 
execute 
on 
this trip that we didn’t get done, 
whether it was getting bunts 
down or moving runners over,” 
said Michigan coach Erik Bakich. 
“Those are the things that just 
need repetition. Those are the 
things that we haven’t been able 
to do in training, and the areas we 
need to work on the most.” 
Going forward, the key to the 
Wolverines’ consistency will be 
their pitching. The pitching staff 
has showed flashes of brilliance 
this season, from a complete game 
one-hitter by junior left-hander 
Tommy Henry to a 10-strikeout 

gem from junior right-hander Karl 
Kauffman against Binghamton. 
When its pitchers are firing, 
Michigan has proven difficult to 
beat.
But when its pitchers struggle, 
as they did in California, so does 
Michigan. Long Beach scored 
six runs in the bottom of the 
third inning off sophomore right-
hander Blake Beers. In the game 
against Oklahoma State, freshman 
right-hander Willie Weiss, who 
has stepped into a closing role this 
season, loaded the bases on a walk 
and two singles before walking in 
the winning run. 
“A couple of hits, not getting a 
couple calls, and ending up with 
a couple of walks – sometimes 
that happens,” Bakich said. “It 
was magnified because it was the 
10th inning, but the numbers don’t 
tell the whole story here. (Weiss) 
made some gutsy pitches in some 
huge spots.”
The Wolverines’ bats were hot 
for most of the trip, continuing 
the tear they went on in their first 
two series of the season. They beat 
up Long Beach for seven runs and 
scored four runs off UCLA starter 
Zach Pettway – one of college 
baseball’s top pitchers – in the top 
of the first inning alone, going on 
to win the game 7-5. Senior third 
baseman Jimmy Kerr had two 
homeruns over the course of the 

trip, one of which was a two-run 
homer to move the Wolverines 
within one run of Long Beach in 
a late-game rally that eventually 
fell short, leaving the tying and 
go-ahead runs on base. 
The offense struggled to find 
consistency over the trip, however. 
Michigan’s offense was only able 
to put two runs on the board 
in its first loss of the season at 
Northridge. In the Long Beach 
game, the Wolverines’ ninth-
inning comeback rally fell just 
short. They only put up one run 
against USC and fell a run short 
once more against Oklahoma State 
in extra innings.
“All the games were close 
because of our pitching and our 
defense,” Bakich said. “We’re not 
even close to firing all cylinders 
offensively. That’s our biggest area 
for improvement right now. But I 
am 100 percent confident that our 
offense is going to start surging 
very soon.”
Michigan’s upcoming home 
opener, a four-game series against 
Manhattan, will be something 
of a return to easier matchups, 
but with contests against No. 3 
Texas Tech and in-state rivals 
Michigan State not too far down 
the road, the Wolverines will need 
to find consistency – especially 
offensively 
– 
to 
remain 
in 
contention this season.

‘M’ looking forward to home crowd

When 
sophomore 
infielder 
Natalia 
Rodriguez 
played 
at 
Alumni Field for the first time last 
season, she didn’t expect how many 
fans would show up. They packed 
the stands. They brought volume. 
And they gave the recently snowed-
over stadium energy. 
Alumni Field brings excitement, 
and starting its home season 
Thursday, the Michigan softball 
team needs to adjust to that 
energy to succeed. Though the 
environment the first weekend 
in Ann Arbor can carry some like 
Rodriguez, playing at home can 
also present new challenges — ones 
that the Wolverines plan to shed in 
favor of home-field traditions and 
hype.
One 
such 
tradition, 
senior 
catcher 
Katie 
Alexander 
mentioned, is writing in the sand 
before games, along with a ‘no 
phones’ rule in the locker room for 
team bonding.
“Especially since we get to be 
in our own locker room, there’s 
definitely some pregame rituals 
and then the whole momentum,” 
Rodriguez said. “We also have 

our playlist, our walk-ups and that 
home feeling.”
Despite those team traditions, 
nerves accompanied Rodriguez’s 
first game at Alumni Field, but 
letting loose and playing the game 
she knew allowed her to overcome 
those pre-game jitters. Rodriguez 
expects the team’s six freshmen, 
following her lead, to also enjoy 
playing at home and focus on their 
game with the new environment 
and colder weather.
“Nerves are natural, but I think 
the way I took it differently is that 
I’m still playing the same game 
and having fun with it,” Rodriguez 
said. “I know we’ll play in the colder 
weather, but it’s natural. We’re used 
to it by now and you get thick skin 
pretty quick.”
Coming off a mixed start to the 
season on the road, with two sub-
.500 weekends, the Wolverines 
(12-10) have had success recently 
in tournaments in the Judi Garman 
Classic and ASU Invitational. 
Particularly, 
Michigan’s 
wins 
against No. 2 UCLA and No. 5 
Washington kickstarted the team’s 
momentum. The Wolverines hope 
returning home will bolster that 
momentum even further.
Regardless of players’ excitement 

and familiarity with the field, 
where they’ve practiced since this 
fall, coach Carol Hutchins noted 
the issues players may face coming 
home. 
Distraction 
from 
fans, 
working on their own schedules 
and dealing with schoolwork are 
some struggles that could affect 
Michigan this weekend.
“We’ve been playing on the road 
for 22 games and we don’t know 
how to play at home,” Hutchins 
said. “Being at home is a new 
distraction. They’re going to come 
straight from class. … They’re 
going to sleep in their own beds 
and they’re going to be away from 
all of the boundaries and rules and 
regulations that we give them.”
Despite those worries, playing 
at home still holds tremendous 
importance to the Wolverines, and 
they hope to carry that feeling from 
the locker room to the field this 
weekend in their first homestand.
“Whether it’s your first time or 
your 500th time, we’re playing on 
our home field in front of our home 
fans, in the place that we love and 
are so proud of,” Hutchins said. 
“After being on the road for five 
weeks, I’m going to tell you… if 
they’re not excited as hell to be out 
on the field I’d be shocked.”

T

he NCAA Tournament is 
just around the corner, 
and on Monday night 
the Michigan 
women’s bas-
ketball team 
(21-11 overall, 
11-7 Big Ten) 
will find out if 
it will receive 
a second con-
secutive bid.
Last sea-
son, the 
Wolverines 
got what they 
wanted, reaching the tourna-
ment for the first time since 
2012-13. The season before, 
they expected to earn a spot 
but ultimately did not. Still, the 
Wolverines went on to win the 
WNIT.
Heading into the previous 
selection shows, those Michi-
gan teams each had 22 wins 
under their belts. This year’s 
group has 21, yet it’s in a better 
position to get a bid — and to 
actually do something with it 
— than past groups.
Why? Because this team is 
trending up.
“I definitely think this team 
is going in a positive direc-
tion,” said senior guard Nicole 
Munger, before Tuesday’s 
practice.
And there is evidence to 
prove it. Michi-
gan has now 
won nine of its 
last 11 games, 
dating back 
to the start of 
February. In the 
final 11 games 
of the past two 
years, the Wol-
verines had 
secured just six 
and seven wins, 
respectively.
“Not to dwell on past years 
too much,” Munger said, “but 
there was a different feel 
around them.”

That different feel is in part 
due to fewer losses in this 
final stretch. But the losses 
also appear to be more quality 
defeats. This team’s two recent 
losses came against Michigan 
State, over two weeks ago, and 
against No. 8 Maryland, Satur-
day night in the Big Ten Tour-
nament semifinals.
In East Lansing, the Wolver-
ines fell 74-64 in a game they 
could have easily won, if they 
hadn’t committed 25 turnovers 
and given up 27 free throw 
attempts. That said, some 
credit should be given to the 
Spartans, who were a quality 
team that had spent consider-
able time in the top 25.
The defeat against the Ter-
rapins, too, had some positives. 
Michigan entered that game as 
the clear underdog, but came 
within arm’s reach of reaching 
the program’s first ever confer-
ence tournament final, eventu-
ally falling 73-72.
“(The Maryland game) is 
something to be proud of,” 
Munger said. “We were down 
ten going into the fourth 
quarter. I think what’s most 
important is the team fought. 
We didn’t roll over and die, 
and we could have done that a 
couple times throughout the 
game. And they made their 
runs but we fought right back. 
I think that just 
goes to show 
that we know 
we can play with 
anybody, and 
I think we’re 
really excited 
for that.”
Saying this 
year’s team 
trends up more 
than past groups 
isn’t an aside to 
those teams. The differerent 
iterations of the Wolverines 
found success at different 
moments in the season, too. It’s 
difficult to make sure everyone 

is healthy and 
harmoniously at 
the peak of their 
game heading 
into tournament 
time. However, 
timing can pay 
dividends and 
Munger takes 
note.
“I think tim-
ing is every-
thing,” Munger 
said. “ … And this team, like 
I said, it’s just very confident 
moving forward and I think 
that’s what makes a team very 
dangerous to play. When a 

team is feel-
ing really good, 
playing with 
nothing to lose, 
that’s really 
tough to beat. 
So, it’s excit-
ing going into 
the final few 
weeks.”
Assum-
ing Michigan 
does make the 
tournament, it has just over a 
week before it starts. Munger 
mentioned taking care of 
the basketball and defensive 
transition as two areas the 

team hopes to sharpen during 
the break. It’s 
important for 
the Wolverines 
to maintain the 
momentum dur-
ing the down 
time. If they 
do, they could 
ride the upward 
trend when it 
matters most.
“I think we’re 
lucky that we 
have this week,” 
Munger said. “ … We’re focus-
ing solely on what we can do 
and what we can do better, and 

that’s pretty exciting going 
into the ‘final 
season,’ as we 
call it, of the 
full season. It’s 
gonna be an 
exciting time 
and I’m excited 
to see what 
improvements 
we can make 
moving for-
ward.”

‘It’s really slowed down for me’: How Jon Teske grew beyond his height

Jon Teske warms up down 
below as his grandfather sits. 
It’s a Sunday in mid-January at 
Crisler Center and Jim Zuidema 
is up in the corner wearing a 
Michigan pullover, sitting near 
the aisle.
Zuidema grabs his phone 
and pulls up his texts, looking 
for one in particular. It’s to his 
grandson and it’s a message to 
play “Teske basketball.”
Three hours later, a victory 
over Northwestern in hand, 
Teske has 17 points and 11 
rebounds to his name. He hit 
three 3-pointers and blocked 
two shots, affecting the game on 
every level. This, in the months 
before and since, has become 
Teske’s norm.
“I think it’s like (John) Beilein 
says,” Zuidema says on the phone 
the day after that game. “It takes 
a couple years to learn. And Jon, 
I think Jon’s right on course 
from what Beilein told me a few 
years back, how he thought Jon 
would progress.”
How Teske has progressed is 
this: Two years ago, he came to 
Michigan and his biggest skill on 
a basketball court was being tall. 
He got his ass kicked in practice 
and rode the bench in games. On 
the year, he played 60 minutes, 
made one field goal and blocked 
seven shots.
Since then, his development 
has proceeded with the slope of 
a 45-degree line. The next year, 
Teske backed up Moritz Wagner 
and looked good doing it. Then 
Teske broke out at the Big 
Ten Tournament final against 
Purdue, creating the lasting 
image of the game by dunking 
on Isaac Haas and yelling into 
oblivion. When Wagner went 
to the NBA last summer, Teske 
stepped into the starting role 
seamlessly.
He started every game of 
the regular season, averaging 
nearly 10 points and swatting 

away 7.8 percent of shots while 
affecting countless more, the 
backbone holding up a defense 
that ranks second in the country 
in adjusted efficiency.
“It’s really slowed down for 
me,” Teske told The Daily. “I 
think it’s just taking time. Some 
people get it right away, but 
others don’t.”
Teske’s path is rarely followed 
in college basketball nowadays, 
but it’s one that fits him. “I know 
Jon will hate anything that I 
said about him, that you write, 
OK,” Zuidema says toward the 
end of our conversation, and he’s 
doubtlessly right.
Zuidema 
talks 
the 
way 
grandfathers are supposed to 
talk about their grandsons. He 
adulates and adores, all while 
staying level about what his 
grandson wants and about his 
role in guiding him on the path. 
He is more interested in talking 
about Jon Teske than Jon Teske 
himself, which is both expected 
and defining.
Teske is one of few people 
on the planet who stands over 
seven feet tall and doesn’t 
automatically dominate every 
room he steps into. He’s cautious 
and 
circumspect, 
thinking 
through every word he says in 
front of a camera and falling 
back on polite clichés when 
the real answer has a chance of 
being twisted or misconstrued.
When I ask when he knew 
Wagner would leave, meaning 
he would start, Teske rejects the 
implicit assumption that there 
was no competition at center 
coming into this season.
“I knew the job would be 
open, that spot would be open,” 
Teske said. “Austin (Davis) and 
I, we worked hard all offseason. 
We knew Colin (Castleton) and 
Brandon (Johns) would be ready 
to come in, too, possibly. So I just 
knew we had to continue to work 
hard and try to help the team 
win. Just be ready for whoever 
won that spot to just go in there 
and do their job, right?”

The result of his demeanor 
is two-pronged: Teske doesn’t 
cause 
controversy 
or 
make 
himself a target for opposing 
teams or fans. He also doesn’t 
get the media attention that 
should naturally come to the 
anchor of one of the nation’s best 
defenses.
But Teske deserves that level 
of attention, even if he doesn’t 
want it, because he is just that.
***
 “No one wanted Jon on their 
team,” says Drew Zuidema, 
Teske’s cousin. “Not at the 
young age.”
There are 18 cousins on 
Teske’s mother’s side of the 
family, nine boys and nine girls. 
At a young age, living in Grand 
Rapids, they spent the summers 
at their grandparents’ house, 
with a hoop in front and a pool 
out back.
While everyone else swam, 
the boys played in front — 
basketball, football, wiffle ball 
— as their grandmother fretted 
about little kids near a busy road. 
It would be an idyllic scene, had 
Teske been on the winning team.
At 
that 
elementary-school 
age, Teske was gangly and 
uncoordinated. He would take 
the ball and run with it instead of 
dribbling, and when the cousins 
split up, old versus young, he’d 
be on the losing team.
“They’d kinda push and blow 
their way to wins,” Teske said. 
“Sometimes cheat their way to 
wins.”
Drew, in contrast, speaks 
with the verve of a winner.
“He was at that awkward 
stage and didn’t know what he 
was doing,” Drew said of Teske. 
“He was always very tall and 
gumpy.”
But Teske has always been 
tall. When the boys would lower 
the 10-foot hoop to try and touch 
the rim, he was the only one who 
could dunk. The rest, that came 
later.
Zuidema 
likes 
to 
tell 
a 
story from when Jon was an 

underclassman at Medina High 
School in Ohio, playing under 
Anthony Stacey. A former player 
and current assistant coach 
at Bowling Green, Stacey was 
tough 
and 
demanding. 
The 
Teske family moved from Grand 
Rapids to Medina when Jon was 
in middle school, and Stacey saw 
the potential in him right away. 
After eighth-grade graduation, 
Teske estimates it was less than 
a week before he started for the 
summer high school team.
On this day, Zuidema sat in the 
stands and watched as Jon stood 
at the top of the key and checked 
the opposing point guard. “I 
about fell off the bleachers,” 
Zuidema said. It’s important 
to note here that Zuidema has 
kept relationships with all of 
Teske’s coaches, calling them 
after games, and isn’t afraid to 
let them know what he thinks.
Stacey came up to Zuidema 
after that game to get his 
thoughts. 
“Well, 
I 
got 
a 
question,” he responded. “Why 
you got Jon out at point guard?”
“I’ll tell you why,” Zuidema 
recalls Stacey responding. “I 
know Jon’s gonna become a 
player in college. I don’t know if 
he’ll play Division I, II or III, but 
he’s gonna play somewhere. And 
I want him to learn how to play 
defense and move his feet.”
Near 
that 
time, 
college 
coaches began taking notice. 
First a trickle of MAC schools, 
then a slow but steady increase. 
By the end of his sophomore 
year, Teske had Big Ten coaches 
calling him, and that summer, 
John Beilein started roaming 
the sideline at his AAU games.
***
The decision to come to Ann 
Arbor, when it came down to 
it, was easy. Teske made it in 
the first few weeks of his junior 
year.
Michigan 
was 
close 
to 

both 
Medina 
and 
Grand 
Rapids. Beilein had a record 
of developing players, and he 
— along with then-assistant 
coaches Bacari Alexander and 
Jeff Meyer — did the legwork 
in building a relationship with 
Teske and his family.
There’s also the education 
aspect of it. When you ask 
Teske, and those close to him, 
about his recruitment, words 
like, “degree” and “graduate” 
become motifs. On one visit, a 
coach showed Zuidema a trophy 
cabinet.
“He 
said, 
‘I 
want 
your 
grandson to win me another 
trophy,’ ” Zuidema said. “And, 
that didn’t go over very well 
with his grandma.”
When 
Zuidema 
sat 
with 
Beilein, the Michigan coach told 
him that yes, he wanted Teske to 
help him win games, but there 
was more to his pitch than that.
“He’s gonna be with you four 
years, coach,” Zuidema recalled 
saying. “You do what you have 
to. Remember, I don’t want him 
here just to win trophies for 
you.”
Of course, the decision wasn’t 
Zuidema’s to make, and nor is 
the one that will be in front of 
Teske when the season ends. 
Back then, he was a three-star 
recruit. Now, if he wants to go 
pro, he can.
It’s easy to see the Big Ten 
Tournament 
final 
against 
Purdue last season, when Teske 
scored 14 points off the bench, 
dunked on Haas and helped 
Michigan to a trophy on a 
postseason stage, as the turning 
point of his college career.
“I know that everyone talks 
about the Purdue game being my 
coming out party,” Teske said, 
stopping short of answering 
whether he himself sees it that 
way. That’s fitting.
“It just kinda showed people 

what I think I’m capable of,” he 
said. “Obviously my teammates 
and coaches have always seen 
that in me, since I’ve gotten 
here. I think it was just, for me, 
just go out there. Just on that big 
a stage, and Moe being in foul 
trouble, it all kinda came out to 
be like that.”
Teske isn’t brash — he’s not 
Ignas 
Brazdeikis 
or 
Jordan 
Poole. He won’t say he’s the best 
free-throw shooter in the world, 
or that he expects every shot 
he takes to go in. He’s caught 
off-guard when asked about the 
decision in front of him after 
this season, but knows full well 
he’s earned the chance to make 
it.
“Um, I wouldn’t say that 
(decision 
has) 
changed 
anything,” 
Teske 
said, 
swallowing his sound. “I think 
just coming in, I knew I wanted 
— I wanted to go somewhere 
that had a good place I could go 
get a good degree at. Just coming 
in here, I knew I was capable of 
doing it. And so we’ll just see 
what happens.”
In 
October, 
the 
question 
of whether he could replace 
Wagner seemed as if it may 
define Michigan’s season. It 
took Teske all of a couple games 
to answer, and the question 
soon shifted to whether the 
Wolverines are better off with 
Teske, and whether he deserves 
All-Big Ten honors.
But Teske’s story is one of 
linear development. He’s built 
strength and conditioning with 
Jon Sanderson in the weight 
room to the point of being able 
to play up to 35 minutes at 85 
inches. He’s gone from a one-
dimensional hand in the face 
to an all-around threat on both 
sides of the ball.
That shift, more than height 
alone, has come to define Teske 
basketball.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | MARCH 13, 2019

There is a man who listens to no song twice.
Or a woman, as always their gender irrelevant.
Every thought is new – containing
a mental puzzle missing thousands of pieces
that he will never finish.
 
 
An analytical mind salvaged from a scrap yard full of toddlers.
Each flowering thought stemming from ‘why?’
He returns to nothing in leaving everything.
 
His ambitions collapse into piled past actions,
sand castles forged from too-dry sand.
 
 
Everything is washed away in waves.
 
Who relishes in the wonder of unanswered questions
Who owns no mirrors
And who stares down the cavern of his consciousness instead
 
 
An unlit tunnel that he is still assembling.
 
In leaving the tunnel, outside colors vibrate in living saturation
and he hears gravel squirm under the burden of passing cars.

The smell of chlorine and freedom lives sharp my mind.
I could recreate our bonfire dances for you.
 
But how can you not remember?
It is as if July slipped away, replaced
 
by fraying textbooks and burnt Ramen soup.
I feel it on the soles of my feet: Pavement.
Burning. Solid. Neighborhood cement and chalk.
 
Remember this: we pretended we started a tribe of
kid bandits in the woods behind my house. We listened for
 
deer and tried to drown out the highway. Intrusive in
our fantasies, we knew the snow was magic and would
 
catch its blare. Do you remember? Frayed size 5 cleats,
Tate’s old Honda truck, cannonballs into icy blue water.
 
The dream of a generation written into the knees of children.
Time capsules in their grinning cheeks. Our slender youth.
 
We could hold onto it forever with this memory.
A year etched into minds, frozen in numbers.

after Seamus Heaney 
 
Poem
makes me think of pomme,
apple, eden, pomme de terre, myth
in earth, God caked in mud and root.
Spading at the clay, Prometheus became
the first poet. Bite with the mouth bones
he gave you and feel like Heaney. Potato digging
is heaven---resurrection, collection, storage-- heaven
is death---absorption, amalgamation, collapse onto a lover---
a relief. Completion. My thought apple
is picked, furrows harvested.
The work is corked and
buried.

The houses have roots here. Even the air is
entrenched, an aftertaste of passion. The breathless
trees trap with resin, and for
 
good reason. The dark fields of the republic
are sinkholes. You can melt into the earth’s black carcass
easier than you think. These hills know how
to make one from two, they were once the glaciers’
 
lovers. If in need of a guide, look to the steeple,
rising like a North Star, and nestle around
its glow. Do not be afraid if your heart
sprouts stakes. Things that aren’t bolted down
get lost here.

i. 
I’ve been feeling more and more lately 
that there are two girls trapped inside of 
me. Like the proverbial angel and devil on 
each shoulder, this conflicting two wage 
constant battle and I find myself deeper 
pulled into their tangled web as each day 
passes me by. There is the good girl. If 
you’ve met me before, this is the one you 
likely came across. She wears a smile on 
her face, maybe a little bit forced, but none-
theless earnest. She is crisply if not ornate-
ly packaged, wearing nice clothes bought 
in shiny bags. She applies her lipstick with 
a delicate hand, careful not to smudge 
around the edges. She is normal. But nor-
malcy is tenuous, and if you know the 
other girl you do not know the good girl. 
If you know her, if you’ve had the distinct 
displeasure of witnessing the anxiety and 
the neuroses and the impulsions which the 
good girl tries so hard to scrub away after 
she reappears, I should apologize. Not only 
to you, but to her, the girl you could have 
known. Because lately I’ve been feeling 
that there are two girls inside of me, and 
they are playing tug-of-war; but what they 
do not know is that this is a game without 
any winners. I am not me, I am them, but 
I cannot be them at the same time and yet 
one cannot exist without the other. So, you 
see, I am in a conundrum. Who am I, when 
all I am is chemicals working wrong and all 
I feel is an illusion? Let these be the whis-
pers in your ear.
ii.
I am not special. Everybody wears 
masks to hide the truth, and nobody is how 
they appear on the outside. Reality is an 
incomprehensible television show wherein 
we are all playacting our best self. Some of 
us are just better actors than others. And 
I would like to tell you now, that I do not 
know where I am going, but that I am try-
ing so hard with every molecule in my body 
to get there. They do not tell you how diffi-
cult getting better is in the pamphlets they 
give you. Those bright smiling faces do not 
express the tears which brim beneath the 
surface, and even as I bite my lips I can-
not keep them down. The words written in 
Sharpie marker tell me to smile, that there 
is joy in this world, but the words inside 
my head suggest otherwise and they are 
carved in stone. Some nights I cannot leave 
my bed. The papers gather, the phone calls 
go to voicemail, and still I resist returning 

up for air. I have learned how to find com-
fort in the wallows of my depression and 
how to be soothed by the familiar lullaby 
of my anxieties. “Better” is a foreign word, 
a far-off planet. This is all just a dream, and 
it is simpler to stay asleep than to pinch 
myself awake.
iii.
College is a time of expectations. The 
only thing heavier than these expecta-
tions is the urge to not let everybody down. 
I want to be better. I see her sometimes, 
when I close my eyes, the girl I might be 
if I could only get better. There is the bet-
ter girl. The better girl is unpolluted. Her 
every smile is genuine. No other girls bury 
themselves within her. I want to become 
her, to shed my skin and wear hers instead. 
Sometimes I feel I am growing closer to 
her, but I have always found that certain 
parts of me hold on tight. Like jealous lov-
ers, they hold me closer each time I try to 
run away. I suppose I should feel flattered, 
but I was never good under observation. 
iv.
A Step-by-Step Guide to Getting Better: 
Brush your hair. Brush your teeth. Smile, 
even if it isn’t natural, because one day 
it will be natural, and all you are doing is 
practicing for that very day. Let go. Let go 
of the bullshit dogging you down, let go 
of the thoughts in your head, let go of the 
people who leave their fingerprints on you, 
nothing is irreversible, no stain cannot be 
cleaned, nobody and nothing is permanent 
but you. Let go. Let go. Let go. 
v.
Someday this will be the past, and I will 
be in the future. I imagine the future all the 
time, until it feels like a book I’ve read and 
loved. But like a book, I wonder if it is just 
a fiction I have written for myself, or if the 
reality I dream of is nothing but another 
byproduct of my mind that I cannot con-
trol. Yet I still believe in it. I believe that 
the good girl and the other girl will even-
tually hold hands. I believe that the better 
girl will be close enough to touch someday. 
I will be happy, a temporary sort of happy, a 
normal sort of happy, and it will be enough. 
I will be enough. There is a version of me 
somewhere who wears her hair short and 
who does not feel like she needs to change, 
and I trust that I am that someone, and I 
believe that someday gets closer every day.

T

he rapping is light, light enough that Otis 
wouldn’t have heard if he wasn’t (gasp-
ing) awake. Fortunately (unfortunately), 
Otis hasn’t been sleeping since the incident, so he 
stumbles across the dark apartment to reach the 
door even as fair knuckles brush against peeling 
wood again. Maple, maybe. Or pine. Otis doesn’t 
care much for details. Another man (an earlier 
Otis) may have checked the peephole. Otis grap-
ples with the door chain. He yanks the door for-
ward.
Otis cannot afford to be a drinking man, and 
he has learned from longer and longer stretches 
of highway in his semi-truck how to stay alert 
enough without sleep. So, when the arm standing 
upright on its shoulder in the poorly 
lit hallway waggles slender fingers 
at him, his mouth opens just a crack 
(real) before he waves back.
It’s Sunday. A week has passed. 
Otis is tired; Otis has been tired 
since he was 13 years old and work-
ing late nights washing dishes to 
help his mama pay rent. He stares at 
the arm, glowing pale white in the 
dim. It (she) tilts to one side at the 
wrist, listening. “It is the cause,” 
Otis mumbles, and he has been 
expecting (her) company. He opens 
the door wider. The arm passes 
through on dainty fingers. “It is the 
cause.”
O

tis had always found driv-
ing 
comforting. 
There 
was something about that 
control as he gripped the steering 
wheel, that stretch of unknown 
road, that known that he was leav-
ing behind. Some truck drivers 
griped about the distance, or slow 
tolls, or tasteless food dripping with 
grease, or stiff necks and backs and 
who knows what else could ache 
besides, but that feeling (control, 
freedom) was enough for Otis. Otis 
was a simple man.
Desiree hadn’t found nearly the 
same thrill. She liked to listen. She’d 
driven her parents’ groaning old 
station wagon for as long as Otis had known her, 
so maybe that was part of the problem. Still, she’d 
come along most of the time, most of the time 
halfheartedly. It had been easy enough to get her 
into the car that night, then, even as the lingering 
sun cast dark shadows up and down the street.
T

he apartment is quiet, and Otis shifts 
his weight while he rubs the back of his 
neck. He can feel a headache starting to 
spread, and he wonders wildly when he had last 
cleaned up around here, made it presentable. It 
has been a week (still weak), at least.
Otis knows he must be the first to speak, (she 
can’t say anything) but what can he say? There’s 
no room for small talk here. He clears his throat, 
opens his mouth, clears his throat again. “How 

have you been?” Barely a whisper. The question 
stands between them in the cramped darkness. 
Pale fingers pause in stroking the carpet. The arm 
raises. The (empty) ring finger beckons slowly to 
him.
Otis slides to his knees without registering he 
is doing so, feels the edge of the couch press into 
the small of his back. “How have I been?” Deflec-
tion. He’s always been a fan. The hand closes 
once, opens again slowly. “It’s been, it’s been-” 
Otis studies his own hands, wide and calloused 
and smudged with grey. “Quieter and lonelier 
than I thought.”
Desiree had used to say Otis was the most pas-
sionate man she’d ever met, but he does not like 

to wear his heart upon his sleeve. He prefers to 
carefully cover it with a jacket.
D

esiree had had the brightest red hair 
Otis had ever seen; it had the frighten-
ing, beautiful quality of fire. Fire was 
(destructive) mesmerizing, after all, and spread 
(devoured) quickly. He had told her without mean-
ing to when he’d first seen her at the downtown 
pharmacy. She’d laughed, and Otis thought — at 
the time — that the hair and the laugh could keep 
him warm for the rest of his life, if she’d allow it. 
Seeing her while she saw him, came to him, had 
filled him with a wonder that didn’t ebb away. His 
mama had always said to be careful with pretty 
girls, but Otis found that that was wrong. The 
pretty girls had to be careful with you.

The last time he’d seen her, her eyes had been 
closed; her skin was a soured milk; her hair was 
fanned out and curled but much too (lifeless) dull. 
She’d been silent. She’d seemed small. Stiff. He 
felt he couldn’t get to her, but maybe he hadn’t 
tried enough. There had been too many rela-
tives pushing against him, the room was stuffy 
and salty with tears, he couldn’t think. It was no 
wonder they’d opted out of a big family wedding 
and gone to the courthouse instead. Simple. Yet 
here Otis had ended up anyway, exactly as he had 
avoided. Alone. 
Nobody had known, though. They didn’t. He 
had made sure of that.
The last time he’d seen her, really seen her, she’d 
been silent, too. In a differ-
ent way. Otis hadn’t minded 
— he had been driving — but 
having her scrunched in the 
passenger seat of her bat-
tered station wagon with 
her arms tight against her 
chest, then one dangling out 
the window wasn’t easy to 
forget. She was chewing on 
her bottom lip. Otis could 
feel the embers of her kin-
dling anger. He remembered 
being 
afraid 
she’d 
draw 
blood, a trickle that’d run 
down her chin. After that, he 
didn’t remember much — the 
way a child will gaze at the 
night sky and rush home to 
scribble the stars in crayon, 
but when the picture’s done, 
they see all they’ve really 
managed to capture is the 
black.
O

tis wants to turn 
on the radio. He 
isn’t sure if the 
situation will be made bet-
ter or worse with a wail-
ing, fading ’80s band filling 
the corners of the silence. 
He decides the situation is 
already leaning towards the 
worse side of things regard-
less of soundtrack, so crosses the tiny living room 
to turn the knob on. Tracy Chapman’s “Fast Car” 
washes through the dark. You got a fast car. Is it 
fast enough so you can fly away? When Otis turns 
back around, the small white hand is in his.
He knows the hand, perhaps better than his 
own. A man doesn’t spend too much time hold-
ing (caressing) his own hand. The hand is soft and 
slightly dry from the unforgiving October air. The 
nails are short and neat and strawberry-pink.
Desiree’s father had been rich, so she had never 
had to work. Not until she’d been with Otis. Her 
hands should have been pristine. Otis hated even 
then (even now) the scraggly skin of hangnails 
she’d pull on while she waited for the lawyer’s 
office phone to ring. She didn’t mind, it was fun 

to talk to all those different people, she’d say, but 
Otis knew better. He usually did.
So I remember when we were driving, driving 
in your car. The hand in his tugs him forward, 
away from the radio, to the carpet. Otis closes 
his eyes (kill the lights) and sways. And I had a 
feeling that I belonged. I had a feeling I could be 
someone, be someone, be someone.
He’s not much of a dancer, but then again, he’s 
never been. It’s easy to pretend, always easier, and 
Otis thinks that despite everything he deserves 
easy. I’d always hoped for better, thought maybe 
together you and me find it. I got no plans, I ain’t 
going nowhere. He feels the hand in his hair slide 
down to the back of his neck. How many times 
had they danced in front of the couch, Desiree’s 
shoes off and her laugh making new harmonies 
while her hair tickled his ear?
And your arms felt nice wrapped around my 
shoulder and Otis keeps his eyes closed.
T

hey had wanted to keep her closed, but 
Otis didn’t think that was fair. Or right. 
Or something, he hadn’t been sure, he 
hadn’t been thinking clearly, but he knew that she 
could not, should not, be contained in that way. 
Besides, she looked fine, the people had done a 
remarkable job with her, those who loved her 
(those who loved her) had the right to — wanted 
to — should see her. Just that one little thing was 
missing, was all, and it wasn’t as great of a deal as 
some of them seemed to think. It could be (worse) 
hidden.
Though he couldn’t help but wonder where 
exactly it was and why they couldn’t find it. There 
was only so much edge to a road, and even pieces 
are eventually found.
Tragedy, that was the word they all murmured. 
Thrown in whispered grains of rice at a wedding 
they hadn’t (been invited to) attended. And it had 
been, it was, Otis had never argued. Yet the word 
had never been enough, nor had its de thesaurus 
brothers. Perhaps this stemmed from Otis’ blank-
ness on the night, in the night when he was ques-
tioned by the blue men when they found him.
You don’t remember, they’d assured him. Was 
that relief? Otis couldn’t tell. But sometimes he 
thought he’d seen her — next to him, then gone, 
then standing in the street incomplete, red and 
blue and white strobes slicing through the dark-
ness of the night.
She was looking at him, he knew, but he couldn’t 
see her eyes.
O

tis has lost his sense of time, though 
on the road he’d been one of the few to 
glimpse the full, peach-orange blush of 
dawn. He has not seen a night like this. He may 
not be seeing it now. The radio is only sound (you 
gotta make a decision, leave tonight or live and die 
this way) and she is only touch, but by God, how 
he’s missed feeling. Warm (cold) fingers trace his 
ear and he remembers more, remembers less.
“Is there pain?” The hand moves slowly to his 
shoulder, and the patch of neck left behind sud-
denly erupts with gooseflesh. Otis tries to catch 
it at his waist, hold it there (keep her there). The 
forearm slides down his leg, is flat, is still. Otis 
gazes at it, his own hands frozen.
A snap of fingers sends him reeling back, sharp 
and then gone.
Had there been pain is perhaps the better ques-
tion, the one that’s crossed his mind the most, 
most difficult to dissipate away. There must be, 
there must have been, but he’s sure, he’s sure that 

it matched his own after that (he shouldn’t have 
stayed for that conversation, he shouldn’t have, it 
was just gossip, just rumors, why had he accepted 
drinks and truths from a coworker after a too long 
shift) conversation. Otis’s mama had once told 
him to look out for turning points. He’d scoffed 
and said he didn’t think real life was as cut and 
dry as that, thank you very much (but oh God, he 
could see it, feel it, now).
There was pain. There always had been. He just 
hadn’t uncovered it until that night in the smoky, 
dark bar.
Otis knew he had not taken for granted that 
he was a lucky man. Sure, he had worked hard 
and long to get that promotion, but he didn’t 
disregard luck’s role in it. He heard what people 
whispered, but he didn’t mind. He knew Desiree 
was too beautiful (good) for him, but he had not 
once (until then) considered that she would look 
somewhere else. Need someone else. She had seen 
him, been his, and chosen him. Otis. If she had 
left, Otis would have followed. Otis would have 
eventually stopped, watched her go until she was 
just another color of the horizon. Otis would have 
been sad, but that would be all.
Instead, Otis had been angry — a surpris-
ing and ugly color on him. It flared deep in 
his belly, alive for the very first time and 
greedy, reducing everything to blacks and 
reds and Otis couldn’t see anything until 
everything was over. Then he saw it all, oh 
yes, vivid and so (beautiful) grotesque.
O

tis grips his coarse hair and pulls, 
gritting his teeth. He is getting 
ahead of himself, or not ahead 
enough.
The hand is slowly slinking over the near-
ly bare shelves of the living room (Desiree’s 
lipsticks and candles and candies are gone, 
Desiree is gone), somehow elegant, somehow 
belonging. She’s looking for something, Otis 
realizes, but doesn’t make a move to help.
“How long?” He whispers, and he doesn’t 
know what matters most — how long (she’ll 
stay, she’ll love him, it’s taken to get to his corner 
of nowhere) has it been since they danced?
The hand closes around a pen.
T

hey had told him to see someone, just to 
talk, just to cope. Talking isn’t a solu-
tion. Words are words, nothing more. 
Any rational mind knows, and Otis has never 
(before) lacked in rationality. Still, when the car 
crashes (though you’re making a living driving) 
and your wife is (not whole) taken and the thing 
you’re most stuck on is her (possibly) cheating, 
maybe talking is the best you can do. Maybe talk-
ing is the life preserver (it just takes one) that will 
scoop you out from that dark and treacherous and 
unforgiving water.
But Otis hadn’t listened. Otis hadn’t talked. He 
(had already sunk too far) couldn’t.
She’d never given him an indication that she 
was unhappy, unsatisfied. He hadn’t questioned 
her. What happy man would? She had been con-
tent sucking on a strawberry lollipop, feet bare, 
eyes bright while he (exaggerated) described his 
travels — that was their love. Desiree had never 
gone far herself — though now she had, she’d 
beaten him now, in a way. In other ways it’s as it 
always had been, him ending up on top.
She whispered that he was good enough for 
her while he slipped away in the morning, keys 
in hand, so he believed he was. He was under her 

spell (the world was) but goddamn if it wasn’t 
ecstasy.
Watch your temper, his mama had said, squint-
ing at split knuckles. Otis had, but it’d slipped 
away in the dark.
T

he hand grasps the pen, tilts it up so the 
gold in the nib glints in ever failing light. 
The pen passes (scritch, scratch) over a 
crumpled newspaper clipping with a big (black) 
bold headline. Otis (cannot look away) isn’t sure 
if he watches for a minute or an hour. The pen 
drops; a crease in the newspaper is smoothed out. 
Fingers linger over the headline before moving 
aside. The hand is poised on the shelf like a min-
iature (broken) ballerina. Otis’s stomach is ice 
(what is he feeling) while he bends over the paper.
The words are in his handwriting. I am not 
what I am. Otis reads them as if there is a ques-
tion mark. 
O

tis hadn’t been (isn’t) a saint. He’d never 
claimed to be. But he had been good to 
Desiree, he had (for the most part). And 
it seemed that the most part was the best a hard-
working man could do. Otis was a hardworking 

man — he got enough money to scrape by, plus a 
little extra; he was respected; he could buy her 
pretty things. Like the cardigan, the emerald-
green (like the green-eyed monster, his mama 
had told him to beware the green-eyed monster) 
cardigan that reached her knees and seemed 
to make her hair glow. It was Desiree’s favorite 
thing to wear.
She’d slip it on as soon as she got home from 
work (maybe that’s why Otis came to loathe it), 
he’d feel the softness on his cheek while she’d kiss 
him hello (warm and milky sweet and fire), he’d 
grasp it fully for a moment, clenched tight in his 
fists before he released it to the floor while she 
slid onto the bed. How he loved her skin under his 
fingers, the paradox of it all, and maybe it was this 
accompanying sensation that had made him so 
(crazy) angry. The beer slurred his senses, made 
his movements (his mind) sloshy, but the anger 
burned red and bright and he hadn’t noticed her 
or her pretty, pinched face as much as he’d noticed 
the absence of the sweater.
“Where is (he) it?” It had been too loud, but Otis 
was too hot. Perhaps she’d tried to answer, but he 
remembered only grasping her arm (tight, naked, 
tight) and shaking her (he’d never hurt her before, 
he wouldn’t again). “You left it in his bedroom, 
didn’t you? Draped across his couch?” Proof. Per-
haps she was confused. Indignant. Angry.

All he’d known for sure was that she’d cried.
And sure, a sobered Otis huddled on his own 
sofa with a cup of black coffee and a nervous, 
skirting Desiree could admit that this whole nasty 
episode was perhaps an overreaction. Except.
The sweater was nowhere to be found. Not in 
their apartment, anyway.
I

t’s amazing how easy it is to unravel him 
(Otis is a simple man). Just the one line, 
yet Otis feels (tired) undone. He can wear 
a mask for everyone, anyone else. He should have 
known he wouldn’t be able to hide from her. He 
hadn’t had to. Wasn’t he lucky?
Otis considers the drying ink, the sentence, and 
wonders how much she knows. Foolish. She can-
not know anything.
She hadn’t when she’d gotten into the car. He 
hadn’t when they’d gotten into the car, not really. 
Long ago he could’ve said that there was nothing 
else to do. Otis doesn’t care to lie.
She’d look radiant in white (but he never got 
to see her) and her father wasn’t there, and he 
should’ve known or maybe somehow the prom-
ise (the cause) had been less, reduced, left like a 
crumpled cardigan in a corner somewhere 
where no one remembered to look.
She’d loved him, though. Hadn’t she? 
Hadn’t he?
“No.” He faces the hand, the arm (his 
love) and it stills in the careful caressing of 
the bookshelf. “I’m not what I am.” White 
fingers grasp a corner, crumple the paper 
into an orb. “And neither were you.” The 
apartment is still. Otis isn’t sure how much 
time has passed. Laughter grapples for 
footing in his throat, but he’s not sure he’s 
won. Darkness seems to press close around 
him, yet in it, somehow, is light. Otis thinks 
of the violence in the flash of a comet plum-
meting to (reality) earth, the flash of head-
lights, of triumph. The fingers crawl slowly 
towards him, and
Otis realizes that he isn’t afraid (was that 
what it had been, had it been fear in her 
face?). The hand strokes his chin, comes to rest 
on the side of his face. She is still perfection. He 
wishes for an instant that he had kept her finger-
print, her handprint, the kiss of her mouth some-
where on a napkin. The hand is warmer now, and 
Otis thinks he can almost feel a pulse there.
There is much (and less) left to do. Otis thinks 
to make himself a cup of tea, to release the patient 
parade of words waiting in his throat, to turn off 
the music. He declines all three. His bare feet 
scuff the floor as he strides to his (their) bedroom. 
At the doorway, he pauses, turns, extends his own 
arm out to the one that perches, unmoving, on the 
living room carpet.
She (not halfheartedly) accepts. It is not hard.
Otis slides under the covers and moves to his 
customary side for the first time since the inci-
dent. She will stay, but soon she will leave, and 
her presence is softer now. He will leave it to time, 
and all will eventually be well. Otis hasn’t been 
sleeping, but his eyes fall shut and he sighs into 
the blackness of the night, asleep as soon as the 
hand rubs his neck, curls up against his pillow.
He is still sleeping when the first cold rays of 
sun slope in through the window, when pale fin-
gers crawl across his chest and close around his 
throat.

O

n Saturday, he came for the ticket at 3:15 and she came 
at 4. He went towards that way and she went towards 
the other way. The event was in a week. It required sun, 
which he hoped for. She wanted rain.
He spent the Sunday with nobody to tell jokes to and she spent 
it with no one to laugh at. Sometimes he would tell a joke out loud, 
to the dense, green trees, just for fun, and take the sound the wind 
made through their leaves as laughter. When she flipped through 
the television channels, hoping for entertainment, she couldn’t 
understand why people were laughing at others for falling, slip-
ping, embarrassing themselves. She just wanted someone to tell 
jokes.
Monday before bed he wrote in his journal, so did she. Each 
day he would write an entry about what happened. Each day she 
would write about what she wished would happen. His were get-
ting shorter and hers were getting longer.
On Tuesday, the weather forecast predicted rain on Saturday. 
But only a 60% chance, he thought, it should be fine. She was 
relieved; It ought to rain at 60%.
While he was at the store on Wednesday he reached for the 
same carton of milk as a woman in a blue dress. Her eyes sparkled 
at him, her hair was a perfect mess, and he let her have the milk. 
While she was shopping, a man tried to take the carton of milk she 
was going for. But then his smile seemed so pure, she forgave him, 
took the carton back, and wondered at what time of day he liked 
to drink milk.
On Thursday, he was able to leave work on time for once. He 
used this extra time to admire and care for his newly grown pink 
and yellow tulips in the backyard. He took pictures of them to 
show to others, not really knowing who. After she came home she 
practiced piano and wondered where the notes flew to when there 
were no other ears to listen to them. She started to hope for sun.
Friday’s rain made him late for work, but he enjoyed watching 
the millions of droplets create pictures on the windows of his car. 
She got caught in the rain on the way home without an umbrella, 
but she liked the way warm rain felt on her lips.
Saturday brought back the sun. On the way to the event his 
mother called and said her house had flooded, he was worried and 
said he would go help. She was on her way to the event, wearing 
her favorite pink lipstick, and stopped to admire the day.
She continued on to the event, he went the other way.

This is a symbol of how I, as an international student, received 
both Eastern and Western education. -Maggie Huang

There are places they tell us not to go,
like that tiny town six hours outside of Philadelphia.
Where pale skin will reach inside your chest and pull out your dignity with a rope.
A rope they’ll try to cinch around your neck,
and make you gasp for air while they laugh.
While you struggle to breathe
struggle just to breathe.
In the air full of thick hatred.
 
Full of whispers from mammas telling their babies not to step foot in the place
that hates the same Blackness that lives inside of them.
Or they’ll snatch your life right out of you and parade you around the town, one less monkey out of the cage.
 
They tell you not to shake the table—
not to poke the sleeping bear.
To tip toe around the hatred and then maybe it won’t seep into you.
But the sleeping bear always finds a way to wake,
the one legged table is always rickety;
one toe is always a tiny bit too big.
And when they hang you, in an empty forest full of unknowns, nobody will know.
Your momma will miss you
but nothing will get done. As a statement
they’ll leave you strung to the tree…
with no sound but the wind.

Between us and the sun

T

he outer planets don’t have phas-
es. The moon has phases, and 
Venus and Mercury have phases, 
because they sometimes come between 
us and the sun. To us, they are sometimes 
made partially of shadows. But the outer 
planets are too far away. They could care 
less about us, let alone what lies between us 
and their sun. They don’t want our perspec-
tive of them. They’re immune to our label-
ing of phases and our view of shadows. It’s 
worked out for them so far.
That’s the thought that put me to sleep. 
I’d never thought of the planets much, but 
for some reason — maybe it was sleep-
ing outside or the edibles we’d stacked on 
our s’mores — that night the planets were 
my new obsession. I closed my eyes on the 
stars, so many more than I’d ever seen in 
the city, and rolled onto some sharp twigs 
and let myself feel them for all they were 
worth through my sleeping bag. Ezra was 
already snoring, his fingers intertwined 
with Nicola’s, asleep beside him. Her beanie 
had slipped halfway off her bald head. I was 
tempted to pull it back on, but she’d been 
having insomnia lately and it would’ve been 
cruel to wake her. Chemo fatigued most 
people, but it’d just made Nicola nocturnal.
I woke up before the others, those twigs 
finding new spots on me to prod me in dur-
ing my restless sleep until I had to give it 
up. My breath shone like the morning dew 
I had to shake off with my sleeping bag. Fog 
rose from the lake, or maybe it was steam, 
or maybe those two were the same thing, 
but, either way, I was pulling off my quar-
ter zip and fleece pants and walking down 
to the water’s edge, naked but for a pair 
of spandex, the only thing that would dry 
afterward. I felt a twinge of guilt for dis-
turbing the glassy surface of the water, but, 
damn, was it warm. Was it warm or was I 
cold? It didn’t seem to matter as I walked in 
up to my breasts, goosebumps adding to the 
imperfections of my skin, crawling across 
the surgical scars on my neck. I paused to 
consider the contrast of the temperature 
above and below the meniscus, the differ-
ence in the kind of soft the air was and the 
kind of soft the water was. As an experi-
ment, I leaned forward and dipped one 
frozen nipple into the lake. It softened. The 
lake was warm.
You’d think all the good stories come 
out of freezing, stormy water that wrecks 
ships and destroys island nations, but there 
are stories about calm water, too. They just 
always involve the water getting disturbed 
in some way. Like, in Greek mythology, 
there was this guy called Tantalus who was 
an amazing cook, and the gods made him 
cook them a feast. Tantalus wanted to put 
all he could into the meal, so much so that 

he sacrificed his own son and made him the 
main course. The gods hated human sacri-
fice, which you’d think Tantalus would’ve 
known, and once they realized what they’d 
been served, they damned Tantalus never 
to be able to eat or drink again. Tantalus 
was forced to stand in a pool of fresh, clear 
water under a tree hanging with ripe fruit, 
but whenever he reached up or down to eat 
or drink, the fruit would shrivel and rot 
or the water would recede from his out-
stretched hand. Water is an agent of ven-
geance.
Another myth was about a god called 
Alpheus who fell in love with Artemis, the 
goddess of nighttime or something, and to 
hide from Alpheus, Artemis ran into a river 
and covered her face with mud so that he 
wouldn’t be able to distinguish her from 
the nymphs and dryads. Then Alpheus was 
turned into a river himself for being a creep 
and was used by Hercules to clean horseshit 
out of some stables. Water is a place of ref-
uge (and nature’s poop scoop).
Lifting my knees to my chest, I slipped 
down under the water. It was murky, but 
not in a way that made it too dark, and I dug 
below the rocky bottom to where the sand 
began and pulled a handful up with me to 
the surface. I rubbed it into my face, just 
like Artemis, scrubbing away the oil that 
had accumulated overnight on my cheeks, 
my forehead and behind my ears. For how 
warm the water was, the sand was cool, and 
it felt as though it drew all the heat from my 
head.
I blinked open one eye and looked back 
to our campsite. Elio had woken up and he 
was standing over at the edge of our clear-
ing, facing the woods, peeing. His nest of 
curly hair was all flopped over to one side 
and his scrawny back hunched forward. He 
finished and turned around. We blinked 
at each other for a few moments, and Elio 
raised a hand. I waved back, toward myself 
— join me. He pulled off his sweater and 
T-shirt, leaving just his boxers, and dubi-
ously picked his way around the still-sleep-
ing couple down to the water. He waded in 
slowly as I had, but once the water reached 
his knees, he dove under. I dipped my face 
in to wash off the scrub and opened my eyes 
underwater, watching him swim toward 
me until he had his hands on my hips and 
was kissing my waist.
We sat together around the breakfast 
campfire. Ezra and Nicola looked suspi-
cious through their sleepy eyes but I didn’t 
address it. Better to let them make their own 
assumptions. I fried eggs in a little stone 
pan over the tiny flame while Elio sliced 
the tops off strawberries with his hunting 
knife. Ezra unscrewed his water bottle for 
Nicola while she counted out her pills and 

swallowed them one by one. Ezra had the 
types of hands that boys can have, the kind 
with impossibly long fingers that seem as 
though they could wrap around an entire 
basketball or reach across four octaves on 
a piano and the tiny orange pill canisters 
were lost in them like a fly trapped in a spi-
der’s web. While the eggs fried, I laid back 
and rested my head on my rolled up pants.
Above us, pine needles danced in the 
morning wind and considered raining 
down on us, only to send flecks of sap in 
their place. The sky was gray, nothing but 
clouds, but the sun was all the brighter 
for it, diffracting across its entire domain, 
looking like the mouth of a tunnel that was 
already behind us.
Nicola scooted toward my side of the 
fire and rolled down next to me while Ezra 
took over my egg duty. She laid her head 
on my chest, facing me, the tip of her nose 
tickling my chin. I felt her warm breath on 
my neck, the breath that always seemed 
to smell like nothing at all. Sterile, like the 
hospital rooms she’d been in and out of for 
the past five years warding off a particu-
larly stubborn bout of leukemia. I’d joked 
before that her breath was due to her never 
breathing fresh air anymore, and I’m sure 
she must have only invited me camping to 
make me watch her take deep breaths. I felt 
her blow on my neck, then laugh at herself. 
She reached up and slapped her hand to my 
forehead, let it slide down my face, pulling 
my lower lip down my chin. I licked her fin-
gers and she snatched back her hand, wip-
ing it on my sleeve. She rolled her head to 
face down to my feet. Nicola didn’t like to 
look up. I think she was afraid of the sky.
It rained during our hike. Like an idiot, 
I wore a fleece jacket and my fleece pants, 
and by the time we were halfway up the 
mountain breaking for lunch, I was soaked 
through. The others had spare clothing 
and were all smart enough to wear wind-
breakers, so I assembled a new outfit and 
wrapped a tarp from my pack around my 
shoulders as a sort of rain resistant cape. 
Elio picked me up by the waist, “Dirty 
Dancing” style, and ran a few paces while 
I kept my arms stretched out, the Super-
woman of the Rockies.
We paused on an overlook, the lake vis-
ible a mile or so away from our vantage 
point. It was sunny over there, the cloudline 
breaking just over the beach. A strange sort 
of promised land in the direction whence 
we’d come. The stretch of damn forest and 
rock that separated us from that sunny 
oasis felt impassable, a horizontal expe-
dition equivalent to trying to reach outer 
space, only with more obstacles stand-
ing in the way.
I tossed a rock experimentally off the 

cliff. It was lost in the fog and made no 
sound over the din of the rain drumming 
on the earth. Ezra came up behind me and 
handed me another rock the size of his fist. I 
lobbed that one, and we both tracked it with 
outstretched hands until it was lost in the 
trees. Ezra swore he heard a thud. I swore 
I heard my shoulder pop out as I’d thrown 
that one, but he didn’t believe me, either.
At the summit, the rain stopped. Or 
maybe we were above the clouds, but that 
seemed unlikely, given how easily even Nic-
ola could breathe. The air hung with that 
post-storm tension, unsure whether it could 
relax, exhale. We padded across a compos-
ite of pine needles and dirt and pebbles all 
glued together with sap in a cross-stitch of 
browns and greens, absorbing the sound of 
our footsteps and leaving no tracks. I won-
dered if animals could still smell we’d been 
there, whether the damp ground trapped or 
masked our scent.
Would Nicola be detected at all? Riding 
on Elio’s back? I’d been hunched over for 
the past few miles, staring at her dangling 
ankles to keep on course, watching them 
swing limply, parentheses around Elio’s 
scrawny legs doing their best not to drag 
his feet. Ezra led our pack, walking stick in 
hand, a fallen branch he’d picked up at the 
base of the mountain. Ezra was easily the 
strongest of all of us, but was still getting 
used to balancing on the new leg, a gift from 
his sarcoma in exchange for the original 
leg, and he leaned heavily on the stick on 
his right side. It looked as if he was rowing 
a gondola. I told him that and he reached 
back to whack me with the stick.
Four kids (or, I guess, young adults), all 
who’d been closer to dying than to living 
lately, unsupervised in the middle of nature 
with absolutely no means to get help should 
it be needed, allowed to go off for a week 
and tempt their odds. Test nature. We were 
all climbing for a different reason. Ezra to 
prove he could do it, Nicola to find some 
sort of absolute silence to forget her world 
of beeping monitors and whirring genera-
tors, Elio because I’d asked him to, and I to 
shorten the distance between me and the 
sun. It wasn’t as romantic as it probably 
could’ve been, but we’d never had great luck 
with how things could be.
My own story had begun and ended 
within the course of nine months. I never 
really counted myself among the others, I 
hadn’t suffered for it, really. Hodgkin’s lym-
phoma. I’d felt the swelling in my neck and 
had a few months of treatments before the 
doctors went in and pulled out what hurt. 
Now, I just had gnarly scars that I planned 
to adorn with tattoos after college and an 
annual checkup.

It was weird being the lucky type of 
cancer patient. Everyone gives you sym-
pathy and you have to go through most 
of the same stuff as the other kids with 
cancer, but it’s like getting a sample. I did 
intravenous treatments for three months. 
I stayed in the hospital for a total of about 
four weeks. I attended a depressing sup-
port group twice. My condition never got 
bad enough that I went to church or made 
right with my enemies. There were a few 
bad nights and one or two real scares 
when the cancer began to spread, but it 
was never anything that couldn’t be fixed 
within the next two or three rounds of 
treatment. I got to miss a bunch of school 
and was made prom queen, so all in all it 
wasn’t so bad. The shitty thing is saying 
all of that. Like, “Yeah, I had cancer, not 
too bad, actually.” I was the asshole in the 
World War I camp whose tummy was a lit-
tle upset while everyone else around him 
was dying of dysentery. I was the prin-
cess in the castle complaining about a dry 
pastry at the ball while the peasants tried 
to outlive the plague. Try and complain 
that your suffering wasn’t bad enough. To 
anyone who hasn’t suffered, you’re still 
someone to be pitied. To anyone who has, 
you’re worse than you think you are.
I met Elio during those intravenous 
treatments. What a classic, sick kid love 
story. I think our medicine bags touched 
while we complained about the slow inter-
net not letting our Twitter feeds load. Elio 
was in for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which 
means he won the “whose odds are worse” 
game we’ve all played a hundred times. He 
was in intensive chemo for a year, though 
now he’d been in remission for two. He got 
two checkups a year, and he was pre-med 
on track to graduate a year early.
The other two were from that support 
group Elio and I went to those two times. 
We hated them. Ezra and Nicola were so 
into it, they were spreading their positivi-
ty and making people weep with hope and 
they lead the prayer at the end and, wow, 
did Elio and I want to just punch them in 
their self-righteous faces. Unfortunately, 
outside of group, Ezra and Nicola were 
just as hilarious and cynical as the two 
of us, even if they were a sickeningly cute 
couple. I’d dared Elio to ask them to do a 
lunch date with us, assuming they’d say no 
because they had to go build a house for 
homeless kittens or something, but they 
said yes, so the four of us got hotdogs and 
Diet Cokes and bitched about bad hospital 
staff for an afternoon.
Nicola was the only one of us who still 
lived in the hospital. Nicola was also the 
only one of us with odds less than 40 per-
cent and the only one of us who’d gotten a 
Wish from the Make-A-Wish Foundation. 
She called it having a “time of departure,” 
meaning that at some point about three 
months ago some doctor who thought he 
knew everything said she had six months 
to live, which is a fucked up thing to say 

to somebody. She used her Wish on a 
cash donation to the hospital which had 
done hardly anything to extend her life, 
in exchange for four vacation days hik-
ing with her friends. Enter Elio, Ezra, and 
Shannon. The hospital trusted Ezra, as 
did Nicola’s parents, and they collectively 
tolerated Elio and me, so here we were, 
with tracker bracelets around our wrists 
like a band of delinquents and a way-over-
the-top mess of camping supplies, chasing 
sunsets and existential meaning.
Lunch on the summit was a bougie 
affair. We had peanut butter sandwiches, 
potato chips, baby carrots and miniature 
cheesecakes. Nicola chased the meal with 
her second round of pills, and I watched 
my feet while she did this, that feeling 
of guilt spreading in my stomach. Nicola 
then pulled a book out of her backpack 
and held it up. “Anyone mind spending an 
hour or two hanging out? Rest up for the 
way back?” We agreed. I grabbed a Coke 

from Ezra’s pack and strung up my ham-
mock between two trees, then hopped in 
for a nap. A nap, however, I did not have, 
thanks to Ezra, who climbed into my 
hammock with me and began pontificat-
ing, in a way that only a man with half a 
metal leg can.
“Shannon, I am not an old man, I am not 
a young man, I’m am not evenly wholly a 
man at all.” He indicated his leg. “I do not 
pretend to be an expert in many things. I 
have never been to New York City or writ-
ten a novel. I have not experienced great 
loss, though that one is coming. And until 
today, I had never even climbed a moun-
tain. But, that is why we are still here, is 
it not? We still have too much to do, too 
many people to meet, and too many stories 
to tell.”
“Very good,” I told him. “The timing 
needs a little work.” He pressed on as if I’d 
said nothing.
“Take the four of us. We are the band of 

misfits to star in any teen movie for which 
they need us. We have it all: charm, wit, 
tragic backstories — one of us even has a 
pending time of death. Tell me that’s not a 
compelling group of protagonists.”
“Is there a point coming?”
“Is there ever? I’m just observing. Be an 
observer, Shan. Don’t think so hard about 
everything, alright? You’re stressing the 
rest of us out.”
“I am not.”
“You’re stressing me out.”
“That sounds like your problem.”
“Well, add it to the list.”
Ezra hopped out of my hammock and 
crossed the clearing to join Nicola. When 
he approached, Nicola began reading out 
loud so he could hear. She did that a lot, 
like she was trying to create a firm impres-
sion of what her voice sounded like while 
she could. I wondered if I would have the 
foresight to do things like that, were it me. 
Probably not. I just listened.
