On March 8, 2010, professor 
Edward P. St. John was removed 
from his teaching position in the 
School of Education. He had 24 
hours to notify his students and 
no means to appeal his removal.
St. John believed his removal 
stemmed 
from 
disagreements 
he had with the policy opinions 
of his dean, Deborah Ball, in the 
Provost’s Achievement Gap Task 
Force, a University-wide advisory 
panel on diversity in higher 
education. He had two options 
going forward: He could accept his 
removal or challenge it in court. 
On June 4, 2010, St. John sued 
the University for denial of due 
process, violation of whistleblower 
laws 
and breach of contract among other wrongdoings. 
St. John told The Daily the University 
began making verbal settlement offers to his 
lawyer. Each potential settlement contained 
a confidentiality clause, a non-disparagement 
clause, a settlement of St. John’s lawsuit and a 
proposed payment to his bank account. 
This confidentiality or non-disclosure clause 
would have permanently prevented St. John from 
speaking of the terms of the settlement. The non-
disparagement clause would have further limited 
St. John’s speech, permanently preventing him 
from speaking poorly of the University or his 

experiences there.
After rejecting two offers of increasing 
monetary value, St. John was offered $500,000. 
He alleges the University described this amount 
as the most that could be paid without the Board 
of Regents being notified. 
This proposed settlement agreement is not 
unique. An investigation by The Daily into 
agreements reached between the University 
and former employees from November 2018 
to April 2019 uncovered 10 such agreements 
across different schools and departments. These 
settlements do not appear in public University 
documents. 
These agreements include “gross lump sum” 

payments by the University totaling more 
than $1,265,000. Of this sum, approximately 
$1,016,000 was paid to former employees. 
$149,000 was paid to law firms representing 
these employees.
“Any settlement where you get money is 
going to be money for silence,” St. John said in 
an interview with The Daily. “(They) are buying 
silence.”
University 
spokesman 
Rick 
Fitzgerald 
disputed St. John’s characterization of these 
agreements as “buying silence.”
 “If you sign an agreement and you still 

think the University has done 
something wrong and you 
wanted to file a complaint … 
with (the University’s Office 
for Institutional Equity) or 
the (federal) Department of 
Education or the (State of 
Michigan’s) 
Department 
of 
Civil Rights, there is nothing in 
that agreement that precludes 
you from doing that,” Fitzgerald 
said in an interview with The 
Daily. “It says disparagement, it 
doesn’t mean you can’t disagree 
with University policy. People 
do that every day around here.” 
In an email to The Daily, 
a former employee currently 
in an agreement with the 
University supported St. John’s 
characterization 
of 
these 
agreements. 
This 
employee 
declined to be identified for fear 
of legal damages; their agreement 
is not part of the ten reported in this 
article.
“Misconduct by my superiors caused me 
to seek counsel, and eventually we arrived 
at a separation agreement including a non-
disparagement clause,” the employee wrote. 
“Coming out of an adversarial situation, such 
language can only be seen as silencing. There is 
no way I could recount my experience with my 
former school, comment on its procedures, or 
speculate on its motives without risking that the 
University find it ‘disparaging.’”

From their first day as students 
at the University of Michigan’s 
College of Engineering, students 
are introduced to the Engineering 
Honor Code, a set of standards 
in place to discourage academic 
dishonesty.
The Engineering Honor Code 
has been in place at the University 
for more than 100 years. By 
following the principles of the 
Honor Code, the document says, 
engineers at the University will 
become successful.
“The standards for personal 
integrity demanded by the Honor 
Code are a reflection of the 
standards of conduct expected of 
engineers,” the Honor Code reads. 

“These standards allow fairness 
among students to ensure that no 
unfair advantage is gained and an 
equal learning opportunity is given 
to all students.”
George 
Sprague, 
assistant 
director of retention and academic 
support services in the College of 
Engineering, said the Engineering 
Honor Code defines academic 
dishonesty under four categories: 
seeking 
an 
unfair 
advantage, 
copying 
and 
plagiarism, 
inappropriate use of resources and 
inappropriate collaboration.
One unique aspect of the 
Honor Code allows examinations 
in the College of Engineering to 
be unproctored. Sprague said 
students have told the College of 
Engineering that this practice 
makes them feel trusted by the 
University.

“It 
makes 
(students) 
feel 
that they have more real world 
experience, whereas they don’t feel 
as though somebody is hovering 
over a button in terms of how 
that has been juxtaposed to other 
units,” Sprague said. “They say it 
hasn’t been that that’s a negative 
experience elsewhere as much as 
they enjoyed the positive aspects 
that they have here.”
Engineering 
sophomore 
Madeline Horvitz said she has 
noticed the difference in the 
way exams are proctored in LSA 
and Engineering. With these 
differences, she said the Honor 
Code grants students a level of 
trust that she appreciates.
“All of my math and physics 
exams were proctored, and for 
engineering, the professors are 
like, ‘All right, I’ll be sitting outside 

of class if you guys have any 
questions, but until then just go 
ahead,’” Horvitz said.
LSA sophomore Victor Li is 
double majoring in Cognitive 
Science and Computer Science 
through LSA. Though he is not 
in the College of Engineering, Li 
has taken classes at the College 
to fulfill his Computer Science 
requirements.
Horvitz and Li both said they 
have not seen anybody cheat even 
with no supervision during exams 
because most people focus on 
completing their own exam.
“If someone wants to cheat, it’s 
probably easier for them to cheat 
because no one’s looking at them 
to see if their eyes are on other 
people’s exams,” Li said.

After 
doctors 
at 
Michigan 
Medicine took 14-year-old Bobby 
Reyes off life support on Oct. 
15, Reyes’ mother Sarah Jones 
is working to pass legislation 
cementing the rights of parents in 
similar situations.
Jones is currently working with 
state Rep. Joseph Bellino, R-District 
17, on a bill that could require 
doctors to gain parental consent 
before removing minors from life-
sustaining treatment. It would also 
likely guarantee families the right 
to find other facilities and request 
a transfer, as well as to file a stay 
in court. They bill, which they are 
calling “Bobby’s Law”, is modeled 
after similar legislation in Arizona, 
known as “Simon’s Law.” 
Reyes suffered an asthma attack 
on Sept. 21 while driving with 
his mother and went into cardiac 
arrest before arriving at C.S. Mott 
Children’s Hospital. After being 
airlifted to the hospital, doctors 
declared Reyes brain dead. 
William Amadeo, the family’s 
attorney, 
filed 
an 
immediate 
request for a 48-hour stay before 
doctors could revoke life-sustaining 
treatment. During this time the 
family was working to find another 
hospital willing to facilitate a 
transfer of Reyes. 
Washtenaw 
County’s 
22nd 
Circuit Court initially ordered 

Michigan Medicine to delay taking 
Reyes off life support. Weeks later, 
Trial Court Judge David Swartz 
ultimately 
allowed 
doctors 
to 
conduct a second test confirming 
their status and to remove life 
support, citing a lack of jurisdiction 
over the case. 
Michigan 
Medicine 
Spokesperson 
Mary 
Masson 
explained the decision to remove 
Reyes from life support.
“Our 
health 
care 
team 
at 
Michigan Medicine continues to 
extend our deepest condolences to 
the family of Bobby Reyes in this 
heartbreaking situation,” Masson 
told The Daily in an email. “By 
law in Michigan, an individual 
is dead who has sustained either 
irreversible cessation of circulatory 
and 
respiratory 
functions 
or 
irreversible cessation of all function 
of the entire brain, including the 
brain stem. Continuing medical 
interventions is inappropriate in 
these cases from both a clinical and 
ethical standpoint.” 
Grant Meade manages policy 
development for Bellino and said 
the firm does not expect the bill to 
face much opposition if it reaches 
the floor. He also explained how 
the law currently stands and why 
Reyes’ parents were not able to 
prevent him from being taken off 
life support.

agreements with employees attempting to speak out

ILLUSTRATION BY CASEY TIN

Buying Silence:


“I haven’t really noticed it 
because I’m always focused on 
my things.”
Cases of Engineering Honor 
Code violation are referred to 
the Engineering Honor Council, 
a group of 20 student volunteers 
who 
oversee 
Honor 
Code 
management and investigate all 
cases of violations. 
“(The 
Engineering 
Honor 
Council) really do serve as 
that 
peer-to-peer 
voice 
of 
accountability,” Sprague said. 
“They also serve as a great voice 
of advocacy, so when (students) 
see something that may raise 
concerns, they have a great 
student 
body 
representative 
force that can go and be 
advocates for those students 
going through a process.”
According to Sprague, 891 
violations 
were 
investigated 
under 
the 
Engineering 
Honor Code during the 2018-
2019 
academic 
year. 
The 
number 
of 
violations 
have 
increased over time because 
College of Engineering began 
implementing 
the 
Measure 

of Software Similarity cheat 
detection system about five 
years ago, Sprague said.
“Some students were caught 
off guard at the level of detail 
that the cheat detection system 
was able to capture,” Sprague 
said. “Any piece of work that 
(students) 
turned 
into 
the 
College of Engineering has 
real a real potential of being 
run through MOSS, this cheat 
detection system. It’s going 
to be compared against not 
only the work of everyone 
in their class, but all work 
that’s been uploaded in that 
system for the past five years, 
as well as resources that have 
been uploaded up from online 
resources.”
Now that more students 
are being made aware of how 
precise the cheat detection 
system can be, Sprague said 
they have seen the number of 
violations drop dramatically. 
During the Fall 2019 semester, 
Sprague estimated his team has 
received under 100 violations.
Horvitz 
said 
she 
thinks 
the Honor Code is a great 
component to the College of 
Engineering and shows a level 
of trust for students. However, 

she 
thinks 
improvements 
should be made to the system 
for 
violation 
investigations 
to ensure the process is more 
up-to-date and runs smoothly.
At the beginning of the 
semester, Horvitz said she 
sent a message in a group chat 
for environmental engineers 
asking if anyone had completed 
a homework problem. Horvitz 
said a person in the group chat 
sent back a photo of his work, 
and 
the 
conversation 
was 
reported by another individual 
in the group chat.
Horvitz said she received 
an email from the College of 
Engineering before Fall Break 
about her case, saying it may 
take four to eight months to 
resolve. Though the incident 
occurred before Fall Break in 
2019, Horvitz said her case 
has not been investigated yet 
due to the backlog of cases, 
even though she was told by an 
advisor that her case would be 
found innocent.
“I have to wait an entire 
semester 
to 
be 
seen 
for 
something I’m already deemed 
innocent for, although I don’t 
have that official innocence,” 
Horvitz said. “I should be 
deemed 
innocent, 
our 
work looks nothing alike 
and I didn’t solicit the 
work. The advisor himself 
said, ‘You look to be 
innocent, your case should 
probably 
be 
wrapped 
up 
once 
you 
actually 
get 
investigated 
quite 
quickly.’ The only problem 
is I have to hold this over 
my shoulder for four to 
eight months.”
Horvitz said she has 
had other friends in the 
College 
of 
Engineering 
who have been indicted by 
the Honor Code unfairly. 
She suggested the College 
of Engineering consider 
making 
updates 
to 
its 
system to make the process 
move more quickly, such 
as establishing a vetting 
process 
for 
cases 
and 
creating a separate team 
to investigate Computer 
Science 
classes 
since 
they generate the most 
violations.
“Given the fact that 
the policies are so many 
decades old and are not 

equipped to handle any of the 
current 
circumstances 
and 
I think their flexibility for 
other people to innocently get 
harmed means they need an 
update,” Horvitz said. “Their 
intent is nice, but their outcome 
isn’t.”
Sprague said the majority 
of honor code violations come 
from coding assignments. He 
said the College of Engineering 
is currently working on ways to 
improve the process of Honor 
Code violation investigations.
To resolve cases in a more 
timely fashion, Sprague said his 
team began offering the option 
for an expedited investigation 
process 
in 
March 
2019. 
Compared to the traditional 
process, the expedited process 
takes 
approximately 
three 
weeks to resolve.
“Essentially, students have 
the opportunity to come in and 
then admit responsibility for 
an alleged violation,” Sprague 
said. “They can also identify 
folks that are potentially not 
responsible, so their cases can 
be dismissed, and we try to 
get those wrapped up and as 
quickly as possible.”
In addition to the expedited 
process, Sprague said his team 
employed an intern during 
the summer who investigated 
cases to help the process move 
at a faster pace and to catch up 
with backlogged cases.
“We’re dangerously close to 
being fully caught up,” Sprague 
said. “We have started the final 
assignments of investigations 
from the Winter 2019 semester, 
and we are actively completing 
expedited processes for cases 
that have been submitted as 
recently as a week ago from 
this Fall 19.”
As an LSA student, Li said 
the only difference he has 
seen between the two schools 
is how they handle cases 
of 
academic 
dishonesty 
— 
while 
Engineering 
students 
are 
referred 
first 
to 
the 
Engineering Honor Council, 
LSA 
students 
are 
directly 
referred to a dean.
“It doesn’t affect me any 
differently than LSA, where 
there is no honor code and 
you get referred to a dean 
(for cheating),” Li said. “I 
feel like there’s not much of a 
difference.”

experiences 
negotiating 
these agreements with the 
University and other entities.
“Non-disparagement 
agreements 
prevent 
the 
public 
from 
knowing 
(of) 
all kinds of harassment and 
discrimination,” Prescott said. 
“These aren’t proved-in-court 
wrongs, but they are things 
that the two parties agree may 
have gone wrong. And usually 
they exist without the payer 
agreeing that something has 
gone wrong.”
Fitzgerald confirmed that 
these 
agreements 
are 
not 
routinely 
disclosed 
to 
the 
Board of Regents or the public.
“We 
can’t 
comment 
on 
the 
specifics,” 
Fitzgerald 
said. “But again, routinely, I 
can only tell you what is the 
pattern. And that is that these 
kinds of settlements do not 
require Board approval.”
The 10 agreements obtained 
by The Daily, furthermore, 
do not necessarily represent 
all 
settlement 
agreements 
reached during this period. 
Nine of these agreements were 
obtained by The Daily through 
a Freedom of Information 
Act 
request. 
This 
request 
was limited to agreements 
signed by two Senior Human 
Resources 
representatives, 
Roberta 
Young 
and 
Linda 
Dabrowski. 
(Neither 
Young 
nor Dabrowski responded to 
The Daily’s email requesting 
comment for this article). The 
10th has already been publicly 
reported.
It 
also 
remains 
unclear 
whether this sum represents 
the 
University’s 
total 
expenditure 
on 
settlement 
agreements over this period 
of time. A review of the 
University’s 
fiscal 
year 
2018-2019 budget reveals no 
specific designation for these 
payments. 
In an interview with The 
Daily, Fitzgerald said these 
costs 
are 
not 
specifically 
designated in the 2018-2019 
budget 
because 
they 
are 
divided by school or unit. He 
also said these payments are 
typically listed as salaries.
“The payments themselves 
are usually borne by the unit 
where the employee works,” 
Fitzgerald said. “Depending 
on the situation, you wouldn’t 
typically 
find 
the 
money, 
because it’s a part of that 
departmental budget.”
As such, the money from 
these settlement agreements 
do not show up in public 
reports on the University’s 
budget.
“Separation 
agreements 
with individual employees are 
not routinely reported to the 
Board,” Fitzgerald said.
The 
Daily 
contacted 
all 
10 former employees in the 
agreements reached between 
November 2018 and April 2019. 
All declined to comment. The 
nature of their agreements 
prevents 
them 
from 
disparaging 
the 
University 
and discussing the terms of 
the agreements.
The Daily spoke with New 
Jersey-based 
employment 
lawyer 
Neil 
Mullin, 
an 
outspoken 
critic 
of 
non-
disparagement 
and 
non-
disclosure 
agreements 
and 
Gretchen Carlson’s attorney 
in 
her 
sexual 
harassment 
lawsuit against Fox News. He 
criticized these agreements 
for promoting a culture of 
secrecy.
“If you want to eradicate 
discrimination, 
harassment 
and sexual misconduct, you 
should let the light of day 
shine,” Mullin said. “Taxpayer 
money is being used to protect 
harassers and discriminators. 
Taxpayers should speak up 
about this.”

AN ISSUE OF ACADEMIC 
FREEDOM

Prior to his removal, St. 
John was celebrated for his 
successes in education policy 
while at the University. He 
had played a pivotal role in 
establishing partnerships with 
Detroit Public Schools and 
aided in the granting of awards 
and partnerships totaling over 
$3 million.
St. John has long been 
considered an expert in higher 
education policy. By the time 

he came to the University of 
Michigan in 2004, St. John’s 
focus research had moved to 
diversity in education.
The vice provost placed 
St. John on the Provost’s 
Achievement Gap Task Force. 
His opinion was sought on 
issues of inequality at the 
University. He served on this 
committee 
with 
Deborah 
Ball, his dean, and Stephen L. 
DesJardins 
and 
Annemarie 
Palincsar, 
both 
School 
of 
Education colleagues.
The Daily reached out in 
an email to Ball, DesJardins 
and Palincsar. All declined to 
comment for this article.
The Daily obtained a copy of 
St. John’s court filing. In this 
document, St. John details 
a meeting he had with Dean 
Ball on March 8, 2010, about 
his teaching. The filing claims 
Ball said she was removing 
him from his teaching position 
— meaning he would still be 
employed by the University, 
but not allowed to teach — 
based on “new information” 
she’d acquired. As St. John’s 
filing notes, he was given 
“no warning, no ability to 
prepare to notify his students, 
teacher assistants, or staff 
about the modifications to his 
employment.”
He also noted his teaching 
evaluations 
had 
been 
“consistently 
higher 
than 
the 
(School 
of 
Education) 
average.” After contacting his 
former students, he “received 
strong 
support 
that 
his 
teaching style … was engaging 
and to the highest level.”
Disagreements 
around 
diversity strategies in these 
meetings underlie St. John’s 
lawsuit. He describes them as 
issues of “academic freedom.”
“I ran into a problem with 
respect to an academic freedom 
question,” St. John said. “The 
new dean got involved in some 
similar committees and so 
forth and they began taking 
it in a direction that I felt 
was inappropriate … It was an 
infringement on my teaching.”
St. John knew it would 
be difficult to win a lawsuit 
against such a large institution, 
but he saw this as the only way 
to get his teaching rights back.
“When someone brings a 
case, you go from the area 
of public discourse to closed 
litigation,” St. John said. “You 
know before you do it that 
you can’t exactly sue your 
institution. I just felt that 
there was a bigger problem in 

my department.”
St. John said the only way 
to continue to speak publicly 
about his experiences at the 
University was to reject this 
settlement offer.
“I refused to take money 
if it meant not speaking as 
I am now,” St. John said. 
“Universities 
just 
calculate 
what they think the value of 
something is and then they 
make you stay quiet.”
These settlement packages 
are similar to those in the 
corporate 
sector, 
St. 
John 
explained. 
While 
this 
might have offered him a 
more profitable and switch 
resolution to his case, he was 
uncomfortable sacrificing his 
rights to speech.
“In the private sector we 
used to call them blowout 
packages,” St. John said. “I 
just could not see ending my 
career that way. Money wasn’t 
an issue.”
These potential agreements 
are essentially an admittance 
of guilt, St. John said. Such 
settlements are an easy way 
for any institution — especially 
a large university with an $11.9 

billion dollar budget — to keep 
these wrongdoings private. 
“In a general sense, once 
they start making offers, they 
are admitting they’re wrong. 
But you can’t speak to it,” 
St. John said. “Corporations 
— and universities are now 
corporate entities, even public 
institutions like Michigan — 
do what they can to cover their 
tracks.”

THE AGREEMENTS

The 
terms 
of 
the 
10 
agreements 
The 
Daily 
obtained 
through 
a 
FOIA 
request are nearly identical. 
The 
employee 
agrees, 
“to 
the extent allowed by law, 
not to make unfavorable or 
disparaging communications” 
regarding the University.
Fitzgerald 
characterized 

these agreements as a mutual 
understanding between the 
University 
and 
a 
former 
employee to “be civil” about 
their potential disagreements.
“It’s … a way of being nice 
to each other, sort of being 
civil about this,” Fitzgerald 
said. “It’s not meant to silence 
people; it’s meant to not get in 
a fight with people once they 
settle.”
Mullin, however, spoke of 
the silencing effects of these 
agreements.
“They conceal from the 
public a public danger and 
wrong,” Mullin said. “Non-
disclosure agreements — or 
NDAs as we call them — allow 
bad actors to remain in the 
workplace 
because 
people 
don’t know about them.”
In her work representing 
clients alleging harassment 
and 
discrimination, 
Prescott 
frequently 
learns 
the 
identities 
of 
alleged 
perpetrators, but the rest of 
the public stays in the dark. 
She questioned the balance 
between the public’s right to 
know about wrongdoing and 
the University’s rights to keep 
complaints confidential.
“How do we balance those 
interests around individuals’ 
ability to resolve something 
and the public’s interest to 
know what is going on?” 
Prescott said. “I drive around 
Michigan, and I look left, 
and I look right, and I see a 
company who has harassed 
some racially or sexually, and 
I can’t talk about it. And I kind 
of think to myself, ‘That place, 
I’ll never do business with 
them.’ But nobody else ever 
knows.”
The 
agreements 
also 
contain 
a 
non-disclosure 
provision: The employee and 
University “will not disclose 
(the 
agreement’s) 
contents 
to third parties except as 
required by law.”
Fitzgerald 
disputed 
the 
idea that this clause is meant 
to limit the disclosure of 

this provision. Its intent, he 
explained, is to allow for the 
release of the settlement under 
the Freedom of Information 

Act.
“We use (FOIA) as the 
process to release information, 
so we see that as a way to 
provide information through 
an orderly process that is … 
consistently applied to similar 
documents,” Fitzgerald said. 
“It’s actually not uncommon 
for 
employees 
to 
actually 
want 
more 
confidentiality, 
but 
the 
University 
always 
includes that phrase in these 
separations agreements.”
Ally Coll is the president 
of the post-#MeToo lobbying 
organization 
the 
Purple 
Campaign and the author of 
a Washington Post editorial 
about sexual harassment law. 
In an interview with The Daily, 
Coll spoke of the detrimental 
effect non-disparagement and 
non-disclosure provisions can 
have on an employee’s ability 

to 
explain 
their 
previous 
employment history.
“When you use those two 
practices 
together, 
it 
has 
the effect of keeping people 
silent about this misconduct 
and 
underlying 
treatment,” 
Coll said. “A lot of times non-
disclosure agreements keeps 
them (from) … speaking out 
about how their agreements 
get resolved.”
These 
agreements 
were 
negotiated 
either 
when 
employees agreed to retire 
from 
the 
University 
or 
when they sought to pursue 
employment 
elsewhere. 
If 
employees 
sought 
work 
elsewhere, 
the 
University 
included 
a 
commitment 
to neutral references. The 
meaning of “neutral reference” 
remains unclear. 
Coll explained that with 
this clause, these agreements 
would leave a hole in an 
employee’s resume as they 
sought employment elsewhere.
“They can’t explain the 
circumstances under which 
they left their previous job,” 
Coll said. “It creates a hole in 
their resumes and … with a 
non-disparagement clause on 
top of it, it is really difficult in 
a job interview.”
Some of these agreements, 
particularly 
those 
to 
lower-level 
employees 
who 
previously 
drew 
smaller 
salaries, contain a provision 
commonly 
referred 
to 
as 
a “no-rehire” clause. This 
clause prevents the employee 
from any future employment 
at the University of Michigan.
“There 
may 
be 
circumstances, with whatever 
is leading to this separation, 
that would say, ‘This is a person 
that we should not rehire in 
another position,’” Fitzgerald 
said. “It doesn’t mean you 
can’t be rehired somewhere 
else, (it) just means you won’t 
be rehired at the University of 
Michigan.”
Coll 
described 
no-rehire 
provisions 
as 
problematic, 

particularly 
with 
lower-
income workers in lower-level 
positions.
“I think no-rehire clauses 

are particularly nefarious,” 
Coll said. “It basically removes 
all of these future potential 
employers who are the types 
of 
employers 
where 
your 
experience is going to be more 
relevant … We see people get 
locked out of entire industries 
that way.”
In 
the 
context 
of 
the 
University, Coll noted that 
these would prevent these 
employees from working in 
another school or unit.
“Where are they going to 
find another job? If you’ve 
moved 
your 
whole 
family 
there and it’s not really an 
option to move to another city, 
then you might be interested 
in finding a position in a 
different department where 
your harasser doesn’t work,” 
Coll said. “If (the University) 
is taking that away in these 
agreements, 
that’s 
further 
limiting 
(the 
employee’s) 
ability to move on.”
The 
agreements 
also 
contain a provision ensuring 
that employees cannot take 
future legal action against the 
University. 
To make sure employees do 
not break their agreements, 
Coll said organizations often 
times send cease-and-desist 
letter. 
“Often times, what you’ll 
see 
is 
organizations 
will 
use cease-and-desist letters 
as a first step if they just 
have a rumor that somebody 
is speaking about it,” Coll 
explained. 
“A 
cease-and-
desist letter is a warning shot 
— a legal letter saying, ‘If you 
don’t stop speaking … we will 
take legal action.’”
Should the University claim 
the employee has broken this 
portion 
of 
the 
agreement, 
the forced arbitration clause 
prevents resolution of this 
claim in the court system. 
Arbitration is sealed, meaning 
these disputes would never 
become public.
In some agreements, the 
University’s 
obligations 
to 
uphold the non-disclosure and 
non-disparagement 
portions 
of the agreement, unlike the 
employee, fall under neither 
potential monetary penalties 
nor forced arbitration.

THE EFFECTS

Non-disparagement 
and 
non-disclosure 
agreements 
have garnered public criticism 
in the wake of the #MeToo 
movement, as reporters have 
revealed how famous men 
such as Harvey Weinstein, 
Matt Lauer and Bill O’Reilly 
used these legal devices to 
prevent the disclosure of their 
alleged sexual harassment and 
misconduct.
Coll spoke of the scrutiny 
these sorts of agreements have 
faced over the past two years.
 “In the wake of #MeToo, 
we’ve 
seen 
companies 
and 
state 
legislators 
and 
lawmakers 
take 
action 
to 
stop the use of these types of 
agreements,” Coll said. “That 
has been effective in a number 
of settings, but it obviously 
hasn’t reached every industry 
or workplace.”
New 
York, 
California, 
Arizona, 
Vermont 
and 
Washington have all recently 
banned 
the 
use 
of 
non-
disclosure agreements, which 
includes 
non-disparagement 
clauses, 
in 
settlements 
involving sexual harassment 
or misconduct.
Recently, 
New 
Jersey 
banned 
non-disclosure 
in 
settlements 
involving 

any kind of harassment or 
discrimination, 
not 
just 
limited to sexual misconduct. 
Maryland’s 
new 
law 

requires employers with 50 
or more employees to publicly 
disclose how many of their 
settlements include a non-
disclosure provision, among 
other requirements. 
Tennessee 
prevented 
all employers from asking 
their employees to sign non-
disclosure provisions relating 
to sexual harassment as a 
condition for employment or 
from renewing NDAs.
It is the taxpayer’s right, 
local lawyer Sarah Prescott 
said, to know how funds 
are being spent by public 
universities.
“State laws around freedom 
of 
information 
prevents 
state actors, including the 
University, 
from 
shielding 
payments,” Prescott said. “If 
there’s a payment of money, 
those 
can’t 
be 
concealed 
because it is the taxpayer’s 
dime, and taxpayers and other 
citizens have a right to know 
where the money is going.”
Prescott 
cautioned 
that 
these 
agreements 
can 
be 
effective in shielding both 
taxpayers and the University 
from huge legal fees.
“How 
much 
was 
the 
exposure for the taxpayer 
that was resolved with that 
$1 million in payouts? There 
might have been $8 million 
in exposure … The University 
might have … managed that 
liability in a very effective and 
efficient way,” Prescott said. 
“I can make a good case that 
the University has examined 
potential wrongs and potential 
damages and has made a good 
case to right the wrongs and 
address it.”
When 
asked 
why 
an 
employee in an agreement 
might not be willing to speak 
to 
The 
Daily, 
Coll 
noted 
the power balance between 
the University and former 
employees when it comes to 
legal resources.
“An institution that has 
many lawyers at its disposal, 
that’s the power disposal that’s 
at (play),” Coll said. “There’s 
a huge power differential at 
play here, both legally and 
financially, on both sides.”
Should 
the 
University 
seek to recover damages for 
an alleged breach of this 
agreement, Coll suggested the 
University would be able to 
easily recover money paid to 
employees.
“The 
most 
common 
situation you see is someone 
(being offered) a settlement of 
their salary for a year (paid) 
out in 4 payments,” Coll said. 
“If they break their non-
disparagement 
agreement, 
and they already got two 
payments, they would almost 
certainly not get any further 
payments, 
and 
they 
could 
bring an action to recover the 
money that was already paid.”
Coll 
remains 
concerned 
these 
agreements 
suppress 
allegations 
of 
wrongdoing. 
She 
suggested 
they 
allow 
companies to avoid addressing 
potential issues of harassment 
and discrimination.
“The 
harassment 
has 
remained 
in 
the 
shadows 
and has kept people silent 
about 
those 
issues,” 
Coll 
said. 
“They 
have 
allowed 
organizations and leadership 
at 
organizations 
to 
avoid 
actually 
addressing 
the 
underlying issue.”
Though 
the 
University 
is a public institution, Coll 
compared these practices to 
those of a private corporation.
“I’m not surprised to hear 
that 
large 
organizations, 
especially 
big 
schools 
… 
operate in many ways similar 
to 
large 
corporations,” 
Coll said. “I do continue to 
be surprised to learn that 
organizations are continuing 
to use that practice today, 
two years after #MeToo went 
viral.”
This problem is not unique 
to the University of Michigan, 
St. John said. Attempts at 
“buying 
silence” 
happen 
across the public and private 
sectors every day. 
“It’s hard to find a university 
where this hasn’t happened,” 
St. John said. “If you believe 
in students, if you believe 
in society, it’s really hard to 
tolerate what they are doing.”

Resist diet culture in the new year

We should embrace aggressive climate plans

A

s the new year looms, 
so do resolutions of 
weight loss. Dieting to 
lose weight is the second most 
popular resolution in the United 
States for 2019, with exercising 
to get into shape being the first. 
Even though only 64 percent 
stick with their resolutions after 
January and only 46 percent 
after June, every year Americans 
pledge to lose weight. 
Diet resolutions feed into our 
fatphobic society, worshipping 
thinness and degrading fatness. 
In fact, data from 2010 show that 
Americans spent over $60 billion 
on dieting and diet products. 
Women’s magazines advertise 
weight loss at every grocery 
store check-out lane and social 
media is littered with clean-
eating accounts and weight-loss 
promises. Even television hosts 
Jenna Hager and Hoda Kotb 
nervously weighed themselves 
live 
on 
air 
before 
starting 
their intermittent fasting diet. 
Moreover, Michigan is the only 
state with a civil rights law 
prohibiting a workplace to fire 
someone because of their weight. 
While some cities have similar 
protections, the other 49 states 
have no state-wide laws. All of 
these contribute to our nation’s 
diet culture.
From intermittent fasting and 
the keto diet to low-fat diets, you 
usually have at least one friend 
trying something new in an 
attempt to lose weight. Fad diets 
continually cycle, brainwashing 
people into believing they will 
actually work. About 95 percent 
of people who lose weight from 
diets will regain the weight (and 
possibly even more) within one 
to five years. Additionally, there 
are more side effects to fad diets 
than temporary weight loss. 
Dehydration, weakness, nausea, 
headaches and general lack of 
nutrients are some of the side 
effects from fad diets. I suffered 
from these same side effects 
when I was actively in my eating 
disorder.
Unfortunately, dieting does 
not only affect adults. Teenagers 

and kids are just as subject to 
dieting and fatphobia. According 
to a study by the American 
Academy of Pediatrics, teenagers 
aged 14 to 15 who dieted 
moderately 
were 
five 
times 
more likely to develop an eating 
disorder and those who heavily 
restricted their diets were 18 
times more likely to develop 
an eating disorder. This was 
coupled with unhealthy weight 
control behaviors. According to 
researcher Dianne Neumark-
Sztainer, 
teenage 
boys 
and 
girls engage in skipping meals, 
smoking, vomiting, laxative use 
and fasting. Diet culture is an 
issue that affects every age and 
gender. And for those already 
eating-disordered, diet culture 
perpetuates eating disorders and 
makes “a full recovery almost 
impossible.” For me, much of 
my time in outpatient treatment 
involved coping with societal 
triggers and evading diet culture, 
especially near the holidays.
This is not to say never try to 
lose weight or be ashamed if you 
have. Everyone has different 
reasons to lose weight. For some, 
it is because of compromising 
health conditions where it is 
important to work with doctors 
and 
dietitians 
to 
create 
a 
sustaining meal plan to remain 
healthy. But by doing so, one can 
still help resist diet culture.
There are multiple ways to 
counteract diet culture. First, 
use the Health at Every Size 
logic and guidelines — weight 
loss or gain is not necessarily 
a sign of improved health. 
Excluding extreme cases, people 
can be healthy or unhealthy at 
any weight. Personally, I know 
skinny and fat people who are 
healthy as well as some who 
are unhealthy. Weight is not 
the sole determining factor of 
health, yet society continually 
shames fat people even though 
being extremely underweight is 
ultimately more dangerous than 
the counterpart. 
Furthermore, 
through 
fad 
diets and fatphobia, our culture 
glorifies eating disorders for fat 

people, while showing concern 
for eating disorders in thin 
people. Society degrades fat 
people while putting thin (and 
emaciated) people on pedestals. 
Therefore, equal access to care 
is necessary. But equal access 
cannot happen until society 
reframes their thinking around 
fat people. It is important to 
reflect on your own weight 
biases and actions.
Second, acknowledge your 
thin privilege, if applicable, and 
use it to help resist diet culture. 
Though a newly popular phrase, 
thin privilege has implications 
everywhere, 
especially 
in 
seating. Knowing you are able 
to comfortably sit in movie 
theaters, doctors’ offices, planes 
and 
restaurants 
means 
you 
have thin privilege. This is not 
a bad thing; people did not ask 
for it. Thin privilege is merely 
a result of a fatphobic society. 
However, people can choose 
to 
acknowledge 
their 
thin 
privilege and become involved 
in activism. From asking how to 
help, welcoming fat people to sit 
next to you or participating in 
Weight Stigma Awareness Week 
these small actions can help fight 
the nationwide fatphobia that 
diet culture encourages.
Finally, 
do 
not 
give 
out 
unwarranted 
health 
advice. 
Health advice should come from 
professionals, such as doctors 
or dietitians. However, make 
sure your doctor or dietitian is 
part of the Health at Every Size 
movement, as even professionals 
can be fatphobic. 
There is no one way to cure 
diet culture. It is a $60 billion 
industry. 
However, 
we 
can 
perform small acts of resistance 
to not only help ourselves but 
others impacted by diet culture 
and the fatphobia within the 
culture. Fat people deserve the 
same treatment as thin people. 
Weight is not a measure of 
worth. It is time our society 
reflects that.

W

hile 
speaking 
at 
the 
Democracy 
Alliance 
meeting 
held 
in 
Washington, 
D.C. 
this month, former President 
Barack Obama criticized far-
left policies promoted by the 
current Democratic presidential 
candidates. 
He 
acknowledged 
that growth as a country is 
possible without having to change 
everything 
about 
it, 
stating, 
“This is still a country that is less 
revolutionary than it is interested 
in improvement. (Americans) like 
seeing things improved. But the 
average American doesn’t think 
that we have to completely tear 
down the system and remake it.”
By referencing some of the 
passionate and aggressively liberal 
presidential candidates such as 
Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and 
Elizabeth 
Warren 
(D-Mass.), 
Obama brings into discussion 
whether we should have the 
mentality of creating revolutionary 
change or implementing gradual 
change. 
In 
other 
words, 
he 
addresses 
the 
monumental 
changes that certainly should be 
made for this country but questions 
their effectiveness if executed 
comprehensively at an immediate 
rate. Some aspects of Obama’s 
legacy could certainly serve as 
an example for institutionalized 
positive change in our country. 
However, 
the 
aggressive 
institutional 
approaches 
taken 
by the Democratic presidential 
candidates are necessary for the 
amount of attention the climate 
issue requires for positive change.
In the face of looming climate 
devastation, 
Sanders 
has 
demonstrated his support for the 
Green New Deal and has catered his 
climate plan towards addressing 
the major issues outlined in this 
nonbinding legislation. Essentially, 
Sanders’s plan consists of phasing 
out 
infrastructure 
dependent 
on fossil fuels, implementing 
planting techniques to sequester 
carbon and targeting oil, gas and 
coal companies for prosecution, 
altogether 
reducing 
carbon 
emissions in the United States 
71 percent by 2030. His plan 
relies heavily on the decisions of 
members of Congress to pass his 
proposed 
legislation, 
evidently 

striving to embed the importance 
of climate care into the law of the 
land. While this plan is projected to 
cost $16.3 trillion over the decade 
during which it is implemented, it is 
also projected to ultimately save the 
United States economy $21 trillion 
over 30 years through averting the 
costs of infrastructural damage 
from natural disasters that would 
occur from intense climate events. 
Following the departure of Gov. 
Jay Inslee from the Democratic 
presidential 
candidate 
race, 
Warren adopted ideas from his 
campaign that focused heavily on 
combating climate change. She 
states in her new climate plan: 
“While his presidential campaign 
may be over, his ideas should 
remain at the center of the agenda.” 
While 
she 
has 
demonstrated 
her foundational support for the 
Green New Deal, Warren also 
considers 
public 
health 
care, 
environmental justice and policies 
that prevent exploitation of tribal 
and public lands as necessary and 
major considerations for an all-
encompassing 
agenda. 
Similar 
to the plan proposed by Sanders, 
Warren’s plan would be funded 
substantially by the reversal of 
the Trump administration’s tax 
cuts for wealthy individuals and 
corporations. In essence, Sanders, 
Warren and other Democratic 
presidential 
candidates 
have 
demonstrated 
the 
projected 
economic 
feasibility 
of 
their 
climate plans to the public in an 
effort to amplify the importance of 
the issue.
When attempting the most 
optimal plan to address the climate 
issue, we are caught between 
making a plan that is feasible and 
considering the likelihood of facing 
irreversible climate devastation. In 
the present reality, we truly have 
no way of knowing how successful 
one plan could be over another 
despite the projected outcomes 
each one has. We are faced with 
these questions as we address 
the climate issue: Is trying to 
implement this radical plan better 
or worse than not trying? Should 
we instead adopt a more realistic 
policy proven to guarantee some 
progress? 
Considering 
the 
current 
decline of our environment today, 

aggressive approaches are the only 
possible methods for restoring 
the environment to the extent 
necessary for living beings to not 
fall into permanent extinction. 
Thus, regardless of their feasibility 
or lack thereof, we should be of the 
mindset that we need monumental 
reconstruction to achieve climate 
restoration.
Today, not enough institutions 
prioritize this mentality in their 
decision-making for the economy 
and public policy. As a result, it’s up 
to us to seek what institutions and 
society fail to present to us and to 
understand that no step forward 
is 
counterproductive 
to 
our 
existence, despite the costs that 
it may carry. We must hold each 
other accountable for the ways 
we think and the actions we take, 
knowing that positive outcomes 
of our actions only occur when we 
make the moral decision. 
Here on this campus, we are 
blessed to even have the choice of 
how we react to the climate issue. 
We take for granted the fact that 
our lives aren’t at stake when we 
choose to be wasteful. We forget 
that the impacts are monumental 
on disadvantaged communities 
and that they have no choice but 
to decide to survive. The climate 
catastrophe 
is 
growing 
more 
volatile and tainted everyday, 
something that we are out of touch 
with because of our privileges 
in this community. Thus, we 
should act like our reaction to 
this issue determines our own 
survival because the necessary 
impact we need to fix the state of 
the environment will only start 
to begin on the day that everyone 
chooses to act for it. In light of this, 
we should all support the people 
fighting for everyone’s survival 
through 
revolutionary 
climate 
policy. Most of those who serve 
are good people — even heroes — 
but our reverence and respect for 
them does not preclude us from 
demanding high standards. In fact, 
unwillingness to discourage the 
misconduct of wayward service 
members cheapens and erodes 
the respect that virtuous service 
members have rightfully earned.

The perils of refusing to call out Eddie Gallagher
L

ast week, in a move 
that defied the wishes 
of Pentagon officials, 
President 
Donald 
Trump 
blocked the removal of Chief 
Petty Officer Eddie Gallagher 
— an accused war criminal 
— from the Navy SEALs. In 
addition, 
Trump 
restored 
Gallagher’s 
rank, 
and 
the 
debacle led to the firing of Navy 
Secretary Richard Spencer who 
had argued against Gallagher 
remaining a SEAL. In a final 
letter 
to 
Trump, 
Spencer 
acknowledged his termination 
and stated Trump does not 
have “the same understanding” 
of the “rule of law … good order 
and discipline.”
Spencer’s letter is scathing, 
and for good reason. Gallagher’s 
retention of his rank and SEAL 
pin is entirely unwarranted and 
defies the moral standards we 
should uphold in our military. 
To recap Gallagher’s case: In 
2017, Gallagher was deployed 
in Iraq with Navy Seal Team 
7. In Iraq, Gallagher allegedly 
stabbed an unarmed, teenage 
ISIS prisoner and took trophy 
pictures 
with 
the 
body. 
Gallagher 
was 
reported 
by 
others in his platoon, and after 
a Navy investigation, Gallagher 
was charged with premeditated 
murder, shooting at civilians (in 
other incidents), threatening his 
subordinates to not cooperate 
with 
the 
investigation 
and 
taking photos with the dead 
insurgent. He was also charged 
with obstruction of justice for 
threatening to kill SEALs who 
report him.
Prior to his trial, Gallagher 
received considerable support 
and attention from several 
conservatives, 
including 
18 
House Republicans, Fox News 
commentator 
Pete 
Hegseth 
and Trump, who intervened 
to move Gallagher to “less 
restrictive 
confinement” 
in 
March. Conservative support 
for Gallagher intensified after 
the lead prosecutor in his case 
was removed for misconduct. 
Still, Navy prosecutors believed 
their case was solid: Gallagher 
had posted trophy photos with 
the corpse, Gallagher appeared 
to admit responsibility for the 
killing in text messages and 
several eyewitnesses testified 
they saw Gallagher stab the 
prisoner.

However, 
the 
legal 
case 
fell 
apart 
when 
Corey 
Scott, another witness who 
was 
conveniently 
granted 
immunity, changed his story on 
the stand and claimed to be the 
one who killed the prisoner by 
covering his breathing tube. In 
the aftermath, Gallagher was 
acquitted of murder but found 
guilty of taking a trophy photo 
with the prisoner’s corpse, for 
which he was demoted.

Now to be clear, while Scott’s 
dramatic reversal torpedoed the 
Navy prosecutors’ legal case, 
abundant evidence points to 
Gallagher’s guilt. When pressed 
on the stand by prosecutors as 
to why he changed his story, 
Scott responded that Gallagher 
did not have to go to prison. 
Scott’s dramatic reversal did 
not spur the other witnesses 
to change their testimony, nor 
does it explain Gallagher’s text 
messages in which he admitted 
culpability for the killing. Navy 
prosecutors were so confident 
Scott’s testimony was a lie 
they explored the possibility of 
charging him with perjury, but 
ultimately concluded there was 
not a viable legal path to do so. 
One final key point is that no 
one, not even Scott, denies that 
Gallagher stabbed the prisoner 
in the neck — though Scott 
claims the stabbing did not 
appear fatal.
Gallagher’s 
acquittal 
provided 
a 
potential 
point 
of 
closure 
in 
the 
saga. 
Unfortunately, 
conservatives 
doubled-down on their bizarre 
commitment to defending a 
clear-cut war criminal, keeping 
the case in the spotlight. Trump 
publicly 
mulled 
pardoning 
Gallagher, reinstated his rank 
and 
ultimately 
intervened 
to allow Gallagher to retire 
as a SEAL. This creates a 

mockery of the independence 
of the military-justice system 
and strains the separation of 
military and political affairs.
In the wake of Spencer’s 
ouster, Defense Secretary Mark 
Esper 
expressed 
frustration 
that the Gallagher case has been 
so “distracted” and “dragged on 
for so long,” confirming that 
Trump made the final decision 
to block his removal from the 
SEALs. Esper is correct that 
the case has been long and 
distracting, 
but 
the 
larger 
shame 
is 
the 
self-inflicted 
black eye for the United States 
military. Our military rightfully 
prides itself on being just, 
precise and professional, but 
this well-earned reputation is 
impugned by the commander-
in-chief’s vocal support for war 
criminals – and it is not just 
Gallagher. Trump, conservative 
media, Republican members of 
Congress and everyone who 
rushed to defend Gallagher and 
other American war criminals 
are to blame for this debacle.
Gallagher is not a good man, 
and he clearly does not exhibit 
the character demanded from 
those who represent the U.S. 
in uniform. However, his case 
offers a lesson on how we react 
to the wrongdoings of those 
who serve. Those who serve our 
country and our communities 
— whether as soldiers, police 
officers, firefighters or first 
responders 
— 
make 
great 
sacrifices and are deserving of 
our sincere and solemn respect. 
However, with their sacrifice 
comes 
great 
responsibility, 
trust and power. Whether it 
be a soldier who kills unarmed 
prisoners or a police officer 
who racially profiles, we must 
be willing to call out those who 
violate the responsibilities they 
are entrusted with. 
Most of those who serve 
are 
good 
people 
— 
even 
heroes — but our reverence 
and respect for them does not 
preclude us from demanding 
high 
standards. 
In 
fact, 
unwillingness to discourage 
the misconduct of wayward 
service 
members 
cheapens 
and erodes the respect that 
virtuous service members have 
rightfully earned.

Republican members 

of Congress and 

everyone who rushed 

to defend Gallagher 

are to blame for this 

debacle

I don’t quite remember what I expected out of 
“Waves,” director Trey Edward Shults’s (“It Comes 
at Night”) latest A24 film. Its promotional material 
is frustratingly vague, describing the plot of the 
movie as nothing more than an African-American 
family in Florida coping with a “loss.” I realize now, 
though, the reason 
for this. To reveal 
anything 
more 
about what happens 
in “Waves” would 
spoil the movie and 
dampen the sheer 
force of its impact. 
I wasn’t prepared 
for this movie. I 
wasn’t ready. I was 
crushed by it, but 
I 
wouldn’t 
trade 
the experience for 
anything. So I won’t 
say 
much 
more 
about the plot either, to ensure that you may watch 
the film unfold in the same way I did. But I can 
write about just how incredible this film is and how 
alive it made me feel. 
“Waves” is a film consisting of two acts, the 
first taking place before the big “loss,” the second 
occurring afterward. The 
first act centers around 
Tyler 
(Kelvin 
Harrison 
Jr., “It Comes at Night”), 
a 
more-or-less 
typical 
high school senior dealing 
with more-or-less typical 
high school problems. He 
is supported by a loving 
step-mother (Renee Elise 
Goldsberry, “One Life to 
Live”), a devoted, though 
admittedly over-aggressive, 
father (Sterling K. Brown, 
“This Is Us”) and a shy 
but loving younger sister 
(Taylor 
Russell, 
“Escape 
Room”). He loves wrestling 
and his girlfriend (Alexa 
Demie, 
“Euphoria”), 
and 
though these perfect parts 
of his life are tainted by a 
severe sports injury and a 
pregnancy scare, his life 
is still, for the most part, 
normal, at least by American 
standards of teenhood. 
It’s 
still 
riveting 
to 
watch. 
Tyler’s 
world, 
gorgeously filmed and set 
to a wonderful soundtrack, 
including songs by Kendrick 
Lamar 
and 
Animal 
Collective, is endearing — 
it pulls you right into its 
atmosphere. Shults does a 
rare, extraordinary thing: 
He films the contemporary 

American teenage experience with warmth and 
honesty and a complete lack of judgement. 
Yet, just when you think Tyler’s arc is about to 
be resolved, the very worst happens. The “loss” I 
keep hinting at finally occurs, and it’s worse than 
you could ever have possibly imagined. A character 
we’ve come to know and trust does something so 
horrifying, so devastating, you ask yourself, how 
will this family ever recover? How can they possibly 
go on? How can they ever smile again? How can we 
ever smile again? 
All of a sudden, this 
family is broken, the 
aspect ratio shifts 
and the world is 
changed 
forever, 
transformed 
into 
something 
scary 
and 
cold 
and 
impossibly lonely. 
But then Luke, 
played 
by 
Lucas 
Hedges 
(“Boy 
Erased”) 
comes 
along 
and 
makes 
everything 
better. 
Not perfect, not back to the way it was before, but 
better. He makes us smile again. He gives Tyler’s 
sister Emily, the star of the movie’s second act, a 
new lease on life. He provides her with an escape 
from the oppressive grief that now holds dominion 
over her parents and home life. By being with him, 
by being held by him, she 
finds a way to heal, or at 
least a way to begin to work 
toward healing. 
Emily and Tyler’s parents 
find a similar solace in one 
another, though it takes 
time, 
and 
they 
actually 
come to resent each other 
and place their anger onto 
each 
other 
immediately 
following the loss. But once 
they are finally ready to 
confront each other’s guilt 
and pain, they readily fall 
into each other’s arms, just 
like Emily and Luke did.
Maybe 
“Waves” 
is 
too 
sentimental, 
too 
melodramatic for some. But 
is that such a bad thing? 
I’m reminded of a quote 
by 
the 
writer 
Jeanette 
Winterson, who wrote that 
“to tell someone not to be 
emotional is to tell them to 
be dead.” Watching “Waves” 
and second-handedly taking 
on this family’s pain was 
painful. But I also felt these 
characters’ joy and their 
incomparable 
love 
and 
devotion for one another. 
Watching 
“Waves” 
feels 
like anything but being 
dead, and I’ve never felt 
more alive while watching 
a movie.

‘Waves’ moves between love,
family and grief in America

“I’ve never seen snow coming from the sky 
before!” 
With a face full of wonder, my freshman 
friend from California spun around outside 
without a coat, giggling at the first snowfall of 
the year. Childlike glee took over my six-foot 
tall assistant director in the middle of musical 
rehearsal. The half of the cast that came from 
warm states either ran outside to join him or 
smiled through the window. But the rest of us 
just sat back and laughed thinking, You’re going 
to hate it in a week!
I was born and raised in Michigan. Michigan 
winters mean pure white snow turns to gray 
slush in a matter of hours, cars get trapped in the 
driveway from overzealous snowplows, freezing 
walks to the bus stop and highways jams from 
blinding sleet. I, of course, still feel a twinge of 
excitement when I wake up to dusted rooftops 
and iced trees. But that only lasts for about 30 
seconds, or until I remember I have to walk to 
class or clear off my car, and I begrudgingly leave 
my warm bed and embark into the cold.
For most of us jaded Michiganders and 
northern state residents, the snow lost its magic 
long ago. Of course we want a white Christmas 
and maybe even a snow day, if we’re lucky, but 
for the most part, it’s a nuisance.
But in the huge out-of-state population that 
the University of Michigan becomes home to, 
some students have never seen snow before. 
Freshmen are often in awe of their first snowfall, 

and even upperclassmen still get a thrill from 
the first of the season. Snow to them doesn’t 
necessarily mean slush-covered jeans and traffic 
jams. They just see a beautiful scene that rivals a 
Hallmark Christmas movie. For those who see 
snow as a standard occurrence, we haven’t felt 
that way in a long time. But seeing our friends’ 
faces light up at the first sign of winter, we start 
to remember the magic we once felt.
Another one of my California freshman 
friends FaceTimed her mom the day of the first 
snowfall. Countless Instagram stories showed 
the snow-covered campus, window views and 
friends in fluffy scarves. I told one of my best 
friends to look out her window, and she texted 
me back “IT’S CHRISTMAS.” Snowmen 
appear in the diag, a block M crop circle covers 
Palmer field, snow angels grace the North 
Quad courtyard.
My friends from California remind me how 
I felt when snow excited me. When a new 
coating of snow meant snowball fights with my 
dad and igloo building with my sister. When 
we would peel off our sopping wet snow pants 
and seven other layers to drink hot chocolate 
so hot that the marshmallows melted. My 
California friends remind me of the look on my 
sister’s face when we thought we were going 
to have a green Christmas, but instead woke 
up Christmas morning to a snowy scene: a 
Christmas miracle.
My heart has been frozen to snow for a 
while, but seeing my friends’ joy at their first or 
just a fresh snowfall is enough for me to start 
to thaw. So thank you, California friends, for 
making snow magical again.

Toward the end of a life, the accumulation of 
regret seems an inevitability, with a minefield 
of mistakes laid out throughout the decades. 
Stephen Dunn’s poetry collection “Pagan 
Virtues” enables Dunn to walk himself and the 
reader through these mistakes as he endeavors 
to change the tone of each misstep from regret 
to acceptance. Dunn has mixed and, at times, 
unclear results in attempting to do so, with his 
cynical style of humor sometimes obscuring his 
feelings despite creating a more enjoyable read. 
His humor often strengthens the collection, 
though, reflecting his divided thoughts rather 
than being a deliberate 
ploy to mislead or confuse 
his audience. But each 
mistake is not equal in 
magnitude, and Dunn 
could 
have 
benefitted 
from greater clarity when 
discussing this in certain 
passages.
Dunn’s 
sentiments 
are transported to the 
reader through one of 
two 
approaches. 
His 
more anecdotal poems 
are shielded by a layer of 
emotional ambiguity: the 
perspective of his former 
self blends together with 
his reflective opinion on 
the event, sometimes to 
the point that the two 
become indistinguishable. While the execution 
of these stories seems lackluster in isolation, 
they usually succeed in giving context to the 
second approach — poems that provide a more 
direct analysis of Dunn’s hindsight, offering 
specific feelings in a general sense. The settings 
from the former allow one to connect the dots 
and understand the broader picture of Dunn’s 
life. On an initial reading, these connections 
mimic those of a scatterbrained detective’s 
bulletin board, but generally are clarified when 
revisited.
“The Errors” is one of the more telling 
poems from the second category, giving clear 
insight to Dunn’s manner of reflection. The 
catch? This poem is placed beyond the halfway 
point in Dunn’s collection. Up until then, the 
reader is unsure of Dunn’s methods, which is 
particularly dangerous for certain poems. In 
“The Errors,” he projects his own interactions 
with past mistakes onto the second person. 
He writes, “The errors you’ve made and keep 
making / linger and indict you long after / 
they’ve become instructive.” Dunn reveals that 
his relationship with past faults is on neither 
extreme of the regret-acceptance spectrum. He 
doesn’t just wallow 
in self-pity; he heeds 
the advice that his 
mistakes 
provide 
to 
prevent 
their 
duplication, but part 
of him still wishes 
the mistakes never 
happened to begin 
with. While Dunn 
acts in the present, 
he still cannot help but think in the past, often 
the distant past, from time to time. This comes 
to define “Pagan Virtues.”
Dunn’s anecdotes are not always fully 
forgivable even as they are explained. They 

often refer to botched romantic efforts, 
which unfortunately come off as creepy or 
misogynistic. He recalls watching a topless 
woman on a beach as she read one of his 
books. He further explains his desire to ask 
her “What is pleasing (her)” every time she 
smiles during her reading. Another time, he 
describes one man’s feeling that flirting has 
been negatively impacted by the introduction 
of media encouraging the use of statements like 
“May I?” shortly before that man wishes that a 
particular woman would wear a more revealing 
dress. In this case, it is unclear whether 
Dunn is projecting his own ideals onto this 
unnamed man or discussing a sort of person he 
experienced in the past. The extent to which 
both these events reflect his present beliefs 
is unclear. These segments 
are wildly distasteful, but it 
is important to consider the 
passage of time after these 
errors later in the reading 
when deciding whether or 
not the displayed sentiments 
apply to Dunn’s current self. 
Also worth considering is the 
fact that, at the time of writing 
this collection, Dunn was 
happily married to his wife of 
many years, so it is likely that 
he is putting himself into the 
shoes of his former self when 
discussing 
other 
women, 
rather than truly wishing he 
had not ended up with his wife. 
Even so, the inclusion of such 
segments is so jarring and off-
putting that it feels as though 
Dunn could not have written them without the 
intention of being remorseful for his past gross 
misconceptions. Dunn may not even be the 
man depicted by the unnamed man at all. 
But unfortunately, this cannot be clearly 
ascertained. 
While 
other 
poems 
depict 
profound regrets for past mistakes, the language 
of the problematic poems themselves is not 
remorseful enough to keep the reader from 
 
feeling great discomfort with Dunn. Many 
great poems leave plenty of work for the reader 
when it comes to extracting the intricacies of 
the author’s meaning, but Dunn simply cannot 
afford to take these liberties when dealing 
with such sensitive and problematic subject 
matter. If people have changed after and felt 
remorse for a dark time in their lives where 
they were unequivocally wrong, coming clean 
and apologizing does not merit admonishment. 
Without the certainty of where Dunn stands, 
the anecdotes cannot serve their (hopefully) 
intended purpose. 
Dunn’s overall acceptance and prolonged 
regret of past faults allows his readers to 
relate to him, although not completely to 
darker times in his life. His brutal honesty 
in spite of what’s 
best for his image 
reinforces 
his 
narrative of regret, 
but 
sometimes 
the reader yearns 
that this honesty 
be 
accompanied 
by a more explicit 
portrayal 
of 
current 
feelings. 
One shouldn’t read “Pagan Virtues” with the 
intention of reprimanding Dunn’s past self, 
Rather, it is about using Dunn’s flawed years 
to reconsider his own history and, from it, 
pave a better future.

“Arth”

Definition:
(noun) a piece of really, really bad art. 

Etymology:
Early 21st century, a Kerrytown porch filled with 
exhausted artists who missed liking their art form.

You are an artist. You are 
tired, and that cold you’ve had for 
about two months is still nestled 
in your nose and throat. 
It is December, and there are 
four collaborations due, two 
final performances, a surplus of 
overly-personal journals to write 
and turn in — and it all has to be 
done in three days. 
Every artist I have encountered 
in the past week has been utterly 
exhausted, creatively bankrupt 
and nervous. The pressure is on 
to show what they’ve learned in 
neat, shiny presentations. 
When looking at art, my 
mind generally breaks whatever I’m consuming into 
two evaluative categories: Technicality and heart. 
Technicalities are whatever can be taught, like if a 
charcoal drawing of an apple actually looks like an apple. 
Heart is whether or not it looks like the artist particularly 
cared. Or is “heart” too tacky? It’s that indescribable sense 
of enjoyment that you get from seeing something honest, 
if that’s not too overused as an art-related buzzword.
It’s the same honesty you get when seeing a cartoon 
version of someone as opposed to an oil portrait of them. 
When actors improvise on stage before sinking into 
character. When musicians throw together a slap-dash 

cover of a country song in the 10 minute break in orchestra. 
This element of honesty is driven by recognizing the 
people creating the art as people rather than “artists.” 
When this element is present, we do not see art as removed 
and polished, but as something a person made. There is an 
element of beauty and aesthetic spectacle in high budget 
ballets or a 100 piece orchestra; that is a fact. 
But my favorite pieces of art have always been those 
where you can see the seams, where the process is not 
only evident in the final product, but a part of it. It’s like 
speaking with an incredibly confident and self-aware 
person. You like them because they know who they are 
and they are comfortable with it. 
Often, this is the art that is 
the artist’s favorite to make. 
Particularly 
when 
you’re 
an art student, it’s easy to 
become overwhelmed by the 
pressure to commodify your 
art, to always be thinking 
about how to market yourself 
and how to make your work 
clean and palatable. These 
are useful skills, but they can 
suffocate unadulterated and 
experimental creativity and, 
in turn, an artist’s love for 
their art. 
You are an artist. You 
should make arth. 
Bastardize your own art form. Boldly leap into one in 
which you have zero skill or proficiency. Host a reading 
specifically for bad iPhone Notes poetry, fingerpaint with 
your friends or write a song about the neighborhood cat’s 
secret life. 
Arth is bad. Arth is not polished. It is experience based, 
personal, creative throw-up.
It is compost: It is the eggshells from your goat cheese 
omelette, the banana peels from those pristine pancakes 
you made last Sunday and the orange rind from your 
citrus scone endeavor. It is leftovers and garbage, yes, but 
it is also what helps your garden grow and stay healthy.

ARTH; or, on making bad art

When I first read about “A New Brain,” 
I thought the concept seemed absurd. An 
autobiographical show about a composer 
who suffers a chronic brain injury before 
a deadline for a show he’s writing, and 
that involves a humanized frog? I couldn’t 
imagine how it would unfold.
The Department of Musical Theatre’s 
Studio Production of “A New Brain” easily 
put my concerns to rest. It was a simple, 
humorous and compelling rendition of the 
work. It was exactly what I’d hope for in a 
studio production: Minimal staging and 
costume, yet entertainment nonetheless.
The humorous tone was quickly 
established in the beginning of the show, as 
the main character’s order at a restaurant 
turns into a quirky song about restaurant 
food. This dualism between the characters 
experiencing 
and commenting 
on 
the 
plot 
continues 
throughout. 
When 
the 
main character, 
Gordon Michael 
Schwinn, played 
by SMTD junior 
Jack Mastrianni, 
collapses at the 
restaurant 
and 
is 
rushed 
to 
the hospital, the 
ensemble made up for the limited props 
and lighting in this studio production. 
From an ensemble member running 
around with a flashing headlamp (to 
represent an ambulance) to two curtained 
dividers constantly being wheeled around 
the stage, this work had a decidedly 
modest feel.
This simplicity allowed for some simple 
interjections of humor. A drill being held 
aloft by the doctor, SMTD senior Hugh 
Entrekin, during the operation scene, for 
example, added to what was otherwise a 
rather frightening scene of a man going 
into a chronic brain procedure. The 
doctor’s medical posters had a humorous, 
lightening effect, especially when simple 
smiley and frowning faces at the bottom 
of these posters were meant to signify the 
life-altering nature of these procedures.
The show featured Schwinn’s latest 
musical composition — a musical for 
children hosted by a man named Mr. 
Bungee, played by SMTD junior Matthew 
Sanguine, who dresses in a green sports 
jacket and frog hat. Bungee exists as both 

a personification of Schwinn’s artistic 
work and as a character in his own 
right, demanding that Schwinn make 
his composition deadline despite his 
hospitalization.
Besides Bungee, many of the other 
characters integral to Schwinn’s life 
exhibit easily identifiable stereotypes 
taken to absurd extremes. There was the 
main character’s boyfriend, SMTD junior 
Luke Bove, a man so obsessed with sailing 
that he can’t cut his vacation short to make 
Schwinn’s surgery. And there was the 
main character’s mother, played by SMTD 
senior Madeline Eaton, a doting figure 
who gifts her adult son with a teddy bear 
and spoon-feeds him in an attempt to help 
him recover.
The hospital workers, too, represent 
a few key medical stereotypes. The 
operating doctor cannot help but react 
with excitement to every brain injury. At 
one point, as he learns of a chronically 
injured 
patient 
on another floor, 
he eagerly fist 
bumps Schwinn. 
The two nurses 
represent 
the 
two 
ends 
of 
the 
nursing 
spectrum: 
One 
pampers 
Schwinn, 
while the other 
frequently 
criticizes him.
One 
of 
the 
funniest moments in the show came 
right before Schwinn’s operation, as the 
nurses asked him about his family medical 
history. The ensuing song, “Gordo’s Law 
of Genetics,” pontificates on the genetic 
dominance of unfavorable traits. “Smart 
or dumb / dumb will predominate,” the 
ensemble sings. “Fat or thin / The fat will 
predominate.”
The 
choreography 
in 
this 
song 
accentuated the humor, the lines about 
“fat or thin” accompanied by an imaginary 
rounded-stomach gesture. This was not 
particularly outrageous humor but it was 
intelligent, unpredictable and incredibly 
well-executed. It wasn’t meant to offend 
or to moralize, but it was smart and 
engaging.
I left the theater impressed with the 
Department of Musical Theatre, the 
writing of James Lapine and the music, 
lyrics and story of composer William 
Flinn. It was amusing and entertaining, 
and for a studio show, if not a general 
University production, what more can 
one ask?

SMTD’s ‘A New Brain’ 
is easy & entertaining

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW

SAMMY SUSSMAN
Daily Arts Writer

Harry Styles came out with the music video for “Adore You” 
just a week short of his upcoming album Fine Line’s release. 
The single’s release, however, was supported by an elaborate, 
meandering advertising campaign that spanned several 
months. Together, Harry Styles and director Dave Meyers built 
the fictional city of Eroda from the ground up, with the song at 
the very base. Targeted Twitter ads promoting Eroda emerged 
in October around the release of Styles’s “Lights Up” music 
video. Scattered subtly throughout the campaign were arrows 
pointing to a fine line (or, rather, Fine Line).
Extensive Twitter threads unraveled as quickly as details for 
the album, with conjectures and conspiracy theories running 
rampant. Eroda was immediately recognized as fictional, only 
a map drawing on its website to counter the case. The ties back 
to Styles were tongue-in-cheek once news of this mysterious ad 
campaign broke. Eroda spelled backward is “adore,” a direct 
connection to “Adore You.” This idea was further supported by 
a slogan on the website that read: “Welcome to Eroda! We Adore 
You.” A comment on the Eroda Twitter feed also claimed to 
have booked a visit for December 
for Dec. 13th — an option that is 
one, unavailable and, two, the 
same day as Fine Line’s release. 
Claims of the island’s notoriety 
for cherries, watermelon and 
strawberries also emerged, with 
songs from Fine Line’s tracklist 
also referring to these fruits. One 
of Styles’s new band members 
also has the same voice as the 
announcer for the Eroda ads. A bench seen on an Eroda Twitter 
feed is purportedly located in St. Abbes, Scotland, where Harry 
shot the “Lights Up” video — the list of references to Styles goes 
on and on, but you get the point. The ad campaign was clever 
and successful in garnering attention and interest in Styles’s 
new work, regardless of whether the targets were fans or not. 
The “Adore You” music video confirmed fan theories with 
Meyers and Styles’s elaborate and luscious Eroda landscape. 
The video spans seven minutes with the history of Eroda 
presented prior to that of Styles’s character. The video starts 
like the beginning of a “School House Rock” episode, an 
animated globe whirring before it pans into the Isle of Eroda. 
Located near England and “shaped unmistakably like a 
frown,” the island is home to a forgotten, bleak fishing village 
ripe with superstition. A perpetual spell of “resting fish face” 
is cast upon every native’s face until Styles’s character is born 
with a literally blinding smile. This casts him into solitude and 
isolation, forcing him to leave home until one day, he meets a 
literal fish out of water with a smile much like his. “Loneliness 
is an ocean full of travelers trying to find their place in the 
world,” the narrator puts it simply. From there, the music 
video details Styles’s relationship with his fish friend. The two 

eat tacos together, go for a bike ride and dance upon a hilltop. 
The fish, however, grows larger and larger by the day and its 
species races back to Eroda to find it. This leaves Styles with no 
option other than to release it back into the ocean. The entire 
village unites to help him in this endeavor. This effectively 
clears the clouds cast over Eroda, transfiguring everyone’s 
frown “into the unmistakable shape of a whale’s tale.” 
In all its cheeky, abstract glory, the music video echoes the 
song’s message on doing anything for the person you love. 
Styles may not “walk through fire” for his fish friend, but he 
does almost everything he can to show his appreciation for 
its company, from knitting it a sweater to frantically seeking 
fishbowl replacements to match its increasing growth. His 
relationship with a fish adds a quirky, lighthearted element 
against the gloomy backdrop — it’s a lot more fun than 
screencaps would convey. But that’s not what makes the 
music video so impressive or effective at consolidating Styles’s 
message on love and its freedom from isolation. The video 
tells a story perfectly in tune with the song, but its pithy layers 
beyond the song’s lyrics make it artistically captivating. The 
video gains the bulk of its meaning from abstract gestures, 
like the extended fish out of water metaphor and the shape 
of Eroda as a frown. But these symbols are not static and 
they’re not there for the sake of 
symbolism. Rather, the transience 
of these abstract visuals and 
explanations 
envisions 
them 
as complex assets to the story. 
We don’t care about the fish for 
what it represents; rather, we 
appreciate that it has an impact on 
the protagonist of our story and 
moves the plot along in tandem 
with the song’s progression.
The marketing campaign only took this clever video 
up another caliber. It not only heightened anticipation for 
Styles’s music video release and album, but developed a 
complex story arc for Styles’s art. Whereas most artists rely 
on their on-screen personality and overall effect on others 
to carry anticipation for their work, Styles developed an 
artistic marketing ploy to bounce off the anticipation of his 
fans for his new work. The social media ads were developed 
over a long period of time, with attention radared to the 
movements of fans and followers over the internet. “When 
they found (something) we adjusted and/or leaned on it to 
make sure that they could further go down the rabbit hole,” 
says Columbia digital media director John Salcedo. The social 
media ruse, more effectively than his robust Saturday Night 
Live double feature as a host and musical guest or Graham 
Norton performance, brought traction for “Adore You” and 
Fine Line. This tactic puts Styles’s artistic flare at the center 
of his celebrity. His artistry doesn’t strive for attention, but 
rather appreciation as complex and beautiful pop music. This 
separates Styles from his boyband past by putting his artistry 
at the core, not stifling and reworking his personality to better 
fit a strain or audience for attention.

Take a little journey to Eroda. 
Meet my artist friend, Harry

Exhibition of potential

Four.
The number of freshmen 
on 
the 
Michigan 
women’s 
gymnastics team.
Three.
The number of freshmen 
who 
competed 
in 
the 
Wolverines’ exhibition meet 
— 
the 
Michigan 
Quad 
in 
Crisler Center against Central 
Michigan, Western Michigan 
and Eastern Michigan.
Two.
The number of Michigan 
gymnasts who competed all-
around, 
including 
freshman 
Sierra Brooks.
One.
The place Brooks finished in 
the all-around category.
In 
the 
exhibition, 
the 
Michigan 
freshmen 
class 
brought its stellar reputation 
to the floor. And the beam, and 
the bars, and the vault. Three 
of the four freshmen — Gabby 
Wilson, Nicoletta Koulos and 
Brooks — made their collegiate 
debut.
An exhibition meet is a 
unique experience, allowing 
gymnasts to showcase routines 
and test things out in a low-
stakes 
environment. 
There 
isn’t always the same level of 
pressure to perform, something 
the freshmen class capitalized 
on. 
“I just tried to do as best 
I could,” Brooks said. “I just 
tried to keep that mentality 
throughout the meet. Don’t 
try to change anything too 
drastically because people are 
watching and you’re in Crisler.”
In a team win for the 
Wolverines — with a final 
score of 195.975 — all four 
events were covered by the 
three freshmen: Koulos on 
floor, Wilson on floor, bars and 
vault and Brooks competing 
all-around. 
Koulos, 
despite 
multiple falls during her floor 
routine, scored a 9.075. She also 
did an exhibition on vault, bars 
and beam.

“Nicoletta Koulos fell on the 
floor and I’m not going to say 
that I’m not surprised,” said 
Michigan coach Bev Plocki. 
“We have pushed her a little 
bit. She’s going to be great. I 
have no doubt in my mind that 
she’s going to be great.”
Wilson’s 
performance 
on three of four events also 
trended in a positive direction. 
On vault, she tied with Brooks 
for first out of 
the 
Michigan 
competitors, 
and 
tied 
for 
second between 
the four teams 
with a score of 
9.825. On floor 
and 
bars 
she 
added 
valuable 
points 
to 
the 
Wolverines’ 
team-score. She 
also did an exhibition on beam.
Brooks was one of two 
Michigan 
gymnasts 
who 
competed all-around — the 
other was the NCAA national 
champion on the beam event, 
sophomore 
Natalie 
Wojcik. 

Brooks posted an all-around 
score of 39.425 on her way to 
being the all-around champion 
of the meet. She was also the 
bars champion with a score of 
9.925.
Overall, 
the 
freshmen 
accounted 
for 
almost 
40 
percent of Michigan’s 195.975 
points. Out of that 40, Brooks 
contributed 50.5 percent of 
those points. With the loss 
of 
two 
key 
seniors, Olivia 
Karas 
and 
Emma McLean, 
the Wolverines 
looked 
to 
replace 
their 
six lineup spots 
with 
these 
freshman. The 
freshmen’s 
positive 
early 
performances 
shows 
steps 
in 
the 
right 
direction in filling those spots.
“I think we did really good, 
like, for our first time in 
Crisler,” Brooks said. “It was 
awesome that everybody was 
able to contribute.”

Talented underclassmen lead way in exhibition quad meet win on Saturday, showing what could come this season

An exhibition match is usually 
one to give the seniors and 
captains a solid pre-season tune-
up. It’s an opportunity to give 
the freshman a walkthrough 
at Crisler Center for what’s to 
come. But they aren’t supposed 
to be the ones carrying the team. 
The freshmen are supposed to 
perform like freshman and the 
seniors are supposed to perform 
like seniors. 
But not for the Michigan 
women’s gymnastics team. 
In an exhibition quad meet 
on Saturday, the underclassmen, 
especially 
freshman 
Sierra 
Brooks, 
propelled 
the 
Wolverines to the win. 
Michigan competed against 
Central 
Michigan, 
Western 
Michigan and Eastern Michigan. 
The Wolverines scored 195.975 
points and Central Michigan 
finished second with a score of 
194.500. 
“It’s always an exciting time 
of the year, but it’s also a difficult 
time of year,” said Michigan 

coach Bev Plocki. “This falls at 
really not the best time of year … 
but it just happens to be when it 
is. We still have a month. I guess 
the good news is we still have a 
month.”
Competing 
in 
her 
first 
collegiate meet, Brooks was 
the all-around champion with 
a near-perfect score of 39.425. 
One of only two Michigan 
gymnasts to compete in all 
four events, Brooks highlighted 
her performance with her bar 
routine, posting a score of 9.925. 
“It’s really exciting,” Brooks 
said. “I came in, I didn’t try to 
like have an overall (day), I just 
tried to do as best I could. I just 
tried to keep that mentality 
throughout the meet, and just 
do the routines that I’ve been 
doing inside the gym.”
Sophomore Natalie Wojcik 
placed 
fourth 
all-around. 
She had an impressive floor 
routine, scoring a 9.900. Wojcik 
upgraded the difficulty of her 
routine midway through last 
season, adding a full-on. She 
wasn’t able to perfect it last 
year and it has since been an 
emphasis in practice. 
As 
the 
reigning 
national 
champion in the beam event, 
Wojcik performed strongly in 
her beam routine — her favorite 
event — scoring a 9.875. This 
was not near her best from last 
season, but she is working on 
shaking off the early season 
rust. 
Because 
this 
was 
an 
exhibition meet, all teams were 
allowed to compete with six 
gymnasts in addition to two 
exhibition players. Unlike a 
regular-season meet, regardless 
of the two exhibition scores the 
first six gymnasts in the lineup 
were scored. Plocki capitalized 
on this opportunity and entered 
eight gymnasts in each event. 
“We tried to treat it for the 
most part like a regular meet,” 
Plocki said. “This is a great 
dry run for our athletes, for 
our event staff, for everybody. 
In a regular meet, we would 
probably only put our lineup in 

one exhibition.”
Regardless of the win, like 
any beginning of the season, the 
meet was not flawless. 
“As a team, we have been 
working a lot on landings and 
just cleaning up any little small 
thing we can,” Wojcik said. 
The 
Wolverines 
started 
strong in their first rotation 
on vault. But the pressure of 
competing in Crisler Center for 
the first time this season, and for 
the freshman first time in their 
careers, slowly set in during the 
beam and floor events.
“It’s 
just 
being 
able 
to 
compete beam in a pressure 
situation without giving in to 
some of the negative thoughts 
that go through your head and 
being nervous,” Plocki said. 
“Those routines we will make 
over and over and over again in 
the gym.”
The biggest mistakes came 
during these last two events. 
Four gymnasts fell off the 
beam during their routines, all 
managing to get back on and 
finish their routine. During the 
floor event, freshman Nicoletta 
Koulos fell during her last pass 
through. Plocki attributed this 
to Koulos’ ongoing recovery 
from several knee injuries. 
“(We will) be able to get 
everything ready to go into 
that first real meet and be able 
to clean up some of those little 
mistakes we had today,” Plocki 
said.
Coming out of this meet, 
Plocki is confident that, if her 
team stays healthy, it will have 
considerable depth and be able 
to rotate gymnasts in their 
lineup to keep them fresh and 
healthy and improve as the 
season progresses. One might 
look at Michigan’s season last 
year and see minimal if any 
room for improvement. 
But not for the Michigan 
women’s gymnastics team. 
“There’s 
always 
room 
to 
improve,” Plocki said. “If you 
are 
not 
trying 
to 
improve 
you’re falling behind because 
everybody else is improving.”

Wagner gains confidence with 
performance against Hawkeyes

 The game’s result was no longer 
in doubt. 
With a 14-point buffer and 
just over a minute remaining, the 
Michigan men’s basketball team 
was assured its first Big Ten win of 
the season over Iowa.
Off a long defensive rebound, 
though, even with no need to 
push the ball in transition, two 
Wolverines saw an opportunity 
anyway.
After sending an outlet pass to 
sophomore guard David DeJulius, 
freshman wing Franz Wagner 
hightailed down the floor. The 
Hawkeyes were retreating a little 
too casually for their own good, 
and Wagner was about to take full 
advantage. Almost telepathically, 
DeJulius read the situation and 
hoisted a pinpoint alley-oop from 
30 feet out.
Wagner finished it off with a 
two-handed flush. 
The 
crowd 
inside 
Crisler 
Center erupted, the Michigan 
bench jumped to its feet in 
excitement and Wagner strolled 
away smiling ear-to-ear. The fact 
that the sequence increased the 
Wolverines’ lead to 16 points was 
trivial. What the slam meant in the 
grand scheme of things was much 
more meaningful.
The 103-91 win over Iowa 
pushed Michigan to 8-1 on the 
season. For Wagner, though, Friday 
night was just his fifth college 
game. The heralded freshman, 
who 
played 
professionally 
in 
Germany last season, was forced to 
sit out the first month of the season 
after fracturing his wrist. 
When he returned to action, 
he was thrown right into the fire, 
starting all three games of the 
Battle 4 Atlantis — against Iowa 
State, No. 17 North Carolina and 
No. 6 Gonzaga — and playing 
30 minutes against top-ranked 
Louisville. 
Despite showing positive flashes 

in all four games, Wagner also 
looked a step slow. Offensively, he 
shot 28.5 percent from behind the 
arc and 36 percent overall. It was 
even more glaring on the defensive 
end, where Wagner had some 
missed assignments, and at times, 
let his guard down. 
This was especially true against 
the Cardinals. Wagner was given 
the tall task of guarding their 
leading scorer, Jordan Nwora, and 
struggled to contain him. 
“I think against Louisville, off 
the ball, I played good defense,” 
Wagner 
said 
last 
Thursday. 
“Maybe I could’ve communicated 
a little more. On the ball, I can 
definitely do a better job. He’s a 
really good player though and you 
have to give him credit.”
Against Iowa, Wagner seemed 
to turn a corner on both ends. 
He looked aggressive on offense, 
scoring 18 and getting to the foul 
line 10 times. Defensively, he held 
the Hawkeyes’ second leading 
scorer, Joe Wieskamp, to just seven 
points on 2-of-6 shooting. 
“Franz 
gave 
us 
great 
production,” said Michigan coach 
Juwan Howard. “It was great that 
he played with a lot of confidence 
— not saying he didn’t play with a 
lot of confidence before. But, when 
you see the ball go through the 
basket a few times, it gives you a 
gratifying feeling.”
While it was Wagner’s best 
performance of the season, it 
wasn’t necessarily unexpected. 

Despite a somewhat slow start and 
the occasional miscue, Wagner has 
gradually gained confidence with 
each and every game. The latest 
showing against the Hawkeyes 
was merely a glimpse of what his 
teammates and coaches had raved 
about over the summer.
“Every game I feel better out 
there,” Wagner said. “It takes a 
little time, but I felt good out there 
today.”
Added Howard: “Like I tell 
Franz, you just gotta stick to the 
process. Because it’s tough for a guy 
to only have one practice and come 
in and play three games in a row. It 
wears on you, and then when see 
that your shot is flat or you shoot 
an air ball or you miss a layup or 
you travel, you can get down on 
yourself. That’s something we 
don’t want him to do because he’s 
a big part of our team.” 
Howard never wavered from 
his decision to start Wagner as 
soon as he was ready. He gives a 
solid Michigan roster even more 
of a scoring threat going forward 
and valuable minutes at a sorely-
needed spot.
In the closing minutes of the 
game, knowing what the moment 
had meant to him, Howard gave 
Wagner a high-five and some 
encouragement near the sideline. 
“He just asked me if that felt 
good,” Wagner said. “It was after 
that dunk and I said, ‘Yeah.’
“... It felt good hanging on the 
rim again.”

In win over ‘Cuse, Michigan shows 
lessons learned from early season

The Wolverines were in a 
familiar situation.
Midway through the fourth 
quarter of its Thursday matchup 
against 
Syracuse, 
the 
game 
seemed to be slipping away from 
Michigan — just as it had in the 
Nov. 23 loss to Notre Dame. 
Sophomore 
forward 
Naz 
Hillmon forced a turnover and 
drew a foul on a converted layup 
in transition early in the fourth 
quarter to cut the Syracuse lead 
to four, and it looked as though 
the momentum had shifted to 
the Wolverines. But Hillmon 
missed the free throw, and the 
Orange made 3-pointers on their 
next two possessions. Suddenly, 
Michigan trailed by 10 — its 
largest deficit of the game.
Just as they had against the 
Fighting Irish, the Wolverines 
got anxious, leading to turnovers 
and missed shots. In that game, 
Michigan made just one field 
goal and turned the ball over six 
times over the first 6:30 of the 
fourth quarter, during which 
Notre Dame went on a 12-3 run. 
Thursday, the Wolverines missed 
all three of their attempted 
field goals and committed two 
turnovers over the two-minute 
stretch after Syracuse extended 
the lead to 10. The Orange had 

the game firmly in hand.
Against the Fighting Irish, 
Michigan did little to adjust. It 
continued to sit back in a zone, 
and Notre Dame continued to 
break it. The Wolverines looked 
demoralized as the Fighting 
Irish continued to score with 
ease.
“We couldn’t get a defensive 
stop or consecutive defensive 
stops,” 
said 
junior 
forward 
Hailey Brown after the loss. 
“When you’re not making shots, 
even though you’re getting the 
right shots, if you’re not getting 
stops it’s hard to win that way.”
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico and the players showed 
Thursday that they had learned 
their lesson. With just under six 
minutes left in the game, the 
Wolverines unveiled a stifling 
full-court press. They had shown 
this look from time to time 
throughout their past few games 
— even for a few possessions in 
the first half against Syracuse 
— but they had never looked as 
energized in the formation as 
they had down the stretch of 
Thursday’s game.
Michigan’s press forced six 
turnovers, and the Wolverines 
finished the quarter on a 14-5 
run to force overtime. Michigan 
continued to press in overtime 
and forced five Orange turnovers, 
leading to an 84-76 win.

This defensive switch was the 
clear turning point in the game, 
but the Wolverines would not 
have been able to consistently 
press 
without 
taking 
care 
of the ball. In the loss to the 
Fighting Irish, Michigan had 
seven turnovers in the fourth 
quarter. The Wolverines were 
constantly playing in transition, 
so they couldn’t get set in a full-
court press even if they wanted 
to. Since that game, they have 
worked hard to improve their 
ball security.
“We have a bunch of practice 
guys that come in every day 
and we have been doing drill 
after drill of high pressure, high 
pressure, high pressure,” Barnes 
Arico 
said. 
“People 
double-
teaming you. Six players against 
five of us, putting us in uneven 
numbers. Four of us against 
three. Just trying to simulate 
facing 
long, 
pressure-type 
teams.” 
Against 
Syracuse, 
the 
Wolverines only turned the ball 
over twice in the 10 minutes after 
they began to press. As Michigan 
began to come back, the Orange 
switched to a full-court press of 
their own, but the Wolverines 
didn’t get flustered. Sophomore 
point guard Amy Dilk never tried 
to force the ball up the court on 
her own. She made smart, quick 
passes to avoid traps and get the 
ball past half court with relative 
ease.
“We had four (turnovers) in 
the second half against a team 
that picks up and pressures the 
way that they do,” Barnes Arico 
said. “I thought Amy Dilk was 
phenomenal. When you have to 
go against pressure 94 feet for 40 
minutes, that’s pretty tough to 
do. She handled it exceptionally 
well.”
The loss to Notre Dame was 
a clear wake-up call for the 
Wolverines, and they showed 
what they learned from it in a 
similar game against Syracuse.

The good, the bad and the ugly: Michigan hockey at the halfway point

One game past the halfway 
point of this season, it’s no 
secret that the Michigan hockey 
team’s year hasn’t gone to plan. 
At 6-10-2 overall and 2-7-1 in 
the Big Ten, the Wolverines 
are nowhere close to what 
they expected of themselves 
entering the season.
In the first half, Michigan 
suffered 
through 
a 
seven-
game winless streak and only 
swept its opponent once — Oct. 
18-19 over Lake Superior State, 
which currently sits at 5-14-
1. The Wolverines were swept 
on the road at Ohio State and 
in a home-and-home against 
Michigan State.
In 
short, 
it 
hasn’t 
been 
pretty. The Daily breaks down 
the good, the bad and the ugly 
halfway through the year:
The good
Sophomore 
goaltender 
Strauss Mann has been a clear 
bright spot for the Wolverines. 
A year after Michigan finished 
59th of 60 teams in save 
percentage at .887, Mann is 
12th in the nation with a save 
percentage of .931 and allows 
just 2.06 goals per game, good 
for 14th out of 71 goaltenders.
Michigan has given up the 
seventh-most 
shot 
attempts 
in the country this year, so 
the Wolverines have had to 
rely on Mann as a backstop — 
sometimes much more than 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
would like.
Regardless, 
Mann’s 
performance 
has 
been 
impressive and sorely needed 
after the debacle that was 
Michigan’s 
goaltending 
last 
season.
“I 
love 
the 
guy,” 
said 
freshman 
defenseman 
Cam 
York on Friday. “Nothing seems 
to faze him. He just stands on 
his head every game. We need 
him badly. When he plays really 
well, he gives us a chance to win 
every game.”

In 
front 
of 
Mann, 
the 
Wolverines have been sound 
defensively. They give up 2.17 
goals per game on average, good 
for 11th in the nation.
Last 
weekend, 
Michigan 
allowed just two goals at even 
strength — and just four total 
in the series — to Penn State, 
which has the highest-powered 
offense in the country at 4.29 
goals per game. Despite giving 
up quite a few shot attempts, 
the Wolverines and Mann have 
kept things together on the 
back end and not given up many 
goals.
Michigan has given up more 
than three goals in a game just 
twice on the year and has shut 
out its opponents twice.
“I like this team,” Pearson 
said Saturday after a series split 
against Penn State. “I like our 
goaltending. I like our team 
defense against maybe the best 
offensive team in the country.”
The bad
The Wolverines scored a 
power-play goal in the first 
period at Ohio State on Nov. 1. 
Three weeks later, Michigan 
scored a power-play goal at New 
Hampshire. In between those 
two tallies, the Wolverines went 
0-for-12 with a man advantage.
As it turns out, Michigan’s 
3-of-5 
performance 
on 
the 
power play in its exhibition 
game Oct. 6 was a bit of an 
outlier. 
Things 
have 
been 
looking a bit better of late, but 
the Wolverines’ power play is 
still 42nd in the country at just 
16.2 percent.
Pearson and associate head 
coach Bill Muckalt, who runs 
the power play, have made 
repeated changes to both units 
because of injuries and a desire 
to switch up what isn’t working, 
and the result of that has been 
two power-play units that are 
still struggling to find a rhythm.
Last year, the Wolverines 
finished 44th in the nation at 
15.6 percent, and that was part 
of why Pearson had Muckalt 
take over the power-play duties 

this season. But so far, things 
haven’t improved all that much.
The ugly
You knew this was coming. 
The ugliest part of this team is, 
without question, the offense.
The 
Wolverines 
average 
2.17 goals per game, 49th in 
the country. Of the teams 
that have scored fewer goals 
than Michigan’s 39, none have 
played as many games as the 
Wolverines 
have. 
Michigan 
scores on 6.7 percent of its shots 
— third-to-last in the nation.
Freshman forward Johnny 
Beecher leads the team with 
nine points from a team-best 
five goals and four assists. York 
is tied for second with senior 
forward Jake Slaker at eight 
points, and then three skaters 

have six points apiece and four 
have six.
In contrast, Penn State’s 
top producers have 23, 21 and 
20 points, respectively. A lack 
of offensive output is clearly 
hindering this team, and it’s 
hard to pinpoint exactly what’s 
causing it.
Michigan is fourth in the 
country in shots on net with 
584 and ranks third in total shot 
attempts with 1,078. Its Corsi-
for percentage — a measure 
of how many shot attempts 
a team generates compared 
to the number it allows — is 
51.2 percent, which is just 
above average and means the 
Wolverines generally outshoot 
their opponents.
Pearson 
and 
his 
players 

have frequently commented on 
Michigan not getting bounces 
this season, and at times, it’s 
sounded like an excuse for a 
team that can’t score. But with 
such a high shot total and such a 
low shooting percentage, there 
may be some truth to it.
College Hockey News tracks 
Corsi-for 
percentage 
and 
Twitter user Recovering Ops 
publishes a chart comparing 
Corsi-for 
percentage 
and 
PDO — which is essentially a 
measure of luck — each week. 
To calculate PDO, a team’s 
shooting percentage is added 
to its save percentage. Average 
is considered to be 100 percent, 
and Michigan is just below that 
mark right now while being 
above 
average 
in 
Corsi-for 

percentage.
The numbers suggest the 
Wolverines have been a little 
bit unlucky, but probably not 
unlucky enough to account 
for 
their 
anemic 
offensive 
numbers. And Michigan has 
also battled the injury bug 
this year, with Beecher, York, 
Slaker and senior forward Will 
Lockwood all missing multiple 
games.
But this team is pretty deep 
at forward, and at the beginning 
of the year, Pearson expressed 
excitement about the offense. 
Senior forward Nick Pastujov 
said Michigan was going to be 
able to score at a high rate with 
all four lines.
That clearly hasn’t happened. 
Instead, it’s been far, far uglier.
