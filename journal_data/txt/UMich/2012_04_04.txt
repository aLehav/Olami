Regent Denise hitch
to host fundraiser
with President
Barack Obama
By TUI RADEMAKER
Daily StaffReporter
As candidates campaign for
the 2012 presidential election, the
University's Board of Regents and
University faculty members have
utilized private donations to sup-
port their favored politicians.
According to the Federal Elec-
tion Commission, which both pub-
licly list the names of campaign
donors and the amount of money
they contribute, officials from the
city of Ann Arbor and the Uni-
versity have donated to President
Barack Obama's re-election cam-
paign and the various campaigns of
Republican candidates seeking the
GOP nomination.
Ann Arbor residents donated a
total of about $323,000 directly to
the 2012 presidential campaigns,
according to the FEC. University
faculty and staff donated about
$76,000, while students donated
$7,000, which includes residents

and non-residents ofAnnArbor.
University Regent Denise Ilitch
(D-Bingham Farms) will also host
a fundraising event on April 18
for Obama at her home in Bing-
ham Parms. With the President
himself expected to attend, ticket
prices will range from $10,000 to
$40,000.
"When asked if I would host
the event at my home for Presi-
dent Obama,
I agreed
because I
enthusiasti-
cally support
our presi-
dent," Ilitch
said in a
statement to the Daily Monday.
Ilitch has not yet donated to a
2012 presidential campaign, but
has donated to previous cam-
paigns, including that of President
Obama in 2008, Hilary Clinton,
former President George W. Bush
and Rudy Guliani.
University Regent Olivia May-
nard (D-Goodrich) is also among
prominent University officials
who have donated to the 2012
campaigns, contributing $2,000
to Obama's re-election efforts.

Newspaper: 89.7
percent of'U'
students graduate
in six years
By PETER SHAHIN
Daily StaffReporter
Sometimes the quality of
a university transcends the
numbers, higher education
experts say.
Last month, the Chronicle
of Higher Education, a lead-
ing weekly publication on
college and university affairs,
published a report measuring
numerous statistics for more
than 3,800 universities across
the United States. The Univer-
sity received mixed reviews,
ranking at the third highest
six-year graduation rate of
any leading public institu-
tion at 89.7 percent, but with
the highest cost per under-
graduate degree in the state at

$129,206.
The report also noted that
the University had the low-
est number of Pell Grants per
capita in Michigan with 15
percent of students receiving
the federal financial aid. The
school with the highest num-
ber of Pell Grant recipients
in the state was Wayne State
University, with 43.5 percent
of its student body benefiting
from the program.
In a statement to The Mich-
igan Daily, University spokes-
woman Kelly Cunningham
wrote that an analysis of the
Chronicle's report performed
by Donald Grimes, senior
research area specialist at
the University's Institute for
Research on Labor, Employ-
ment and the Economy, found
issues with the group's meth-
odology.

The delayed certification of the
Central Student Government elec-

to convene past their expected term
limits.
Last night should have been the
first assembly meeting with the
newly elected representatives, but
that will now be moved to April 17,
when in its only meeting before sum-
mer recess, the assembly will elect a
speaker and vice speaker and resolve
any loose ends from the election.
While they already fulfilled the

Cadets and midshipmen rep-
resenting the three branches of
the University's ROTC traded in
their training gear and fatigues

for pressed uniforms and pol-
ished medals last night at the
University's annual Tri-Service
Awards Ceremony.
About 400 ROTC students,
veterans, faculty and fam-

emony in Rackham Auditorium.
Forty-four different organiza-
tions handed out more than 125
awards and scholarships to out-
standing students of the four
branches - the Army, Navy,

Marines and Air Force - which
come together each year for a
ball in March and the service
awards in April.
Engineering sophomore
Joseph Poznanski, an Army

of each ROTC branch.

BOATING ON THE DIAG I

To honor the beginning of
Autism Awareness Month, the
University's chapter of Autism
Speaks U has been working to
develop a variety of activities,
such as a raffle and the distri-
bution of blue ribbons to raise
awareness, as part of its effort
to raise money and awareness
about autism.
Despite its increased work
throughout April, the club is
also active throughout the year.
Autism Speaks U is partnered
with the Judson Center - a local
nonprofit that works to help
individuals with autism, as well
as providing child welfare, men-
tal health and disability services
- to create volunteer opportu-

nities for students who want to
work with children with autism.
Other club events include the
Walk Now For Autism Speaks
event, guest presentations and
research projects for members
to participate in.
The largest event the club
hosts is its annual Alley-Oop
for Autism Speaks U Basket-
ball Tournament. This year, the
organization raised more than
$600 from the event.
The University's chapter of
Autism Speaks U was estab-
lished in September 2009 by
current LSA seniors Maressa
Criscito and Alex Lewisohn
after the pair struggled in find-
ing a campus club that shared

their desire to support children
with autism spectrum disor-
ders. Today, the club has 275
members and is supported by
various other campus organiza-
tions.
"Through this organiza-
tion we get to see firsthand the
positive difference that we are
making in the community,"
Criscito said. "Being part of
Autism Speaks U at the Univer-
sity of Michigan does justice to
the Michigan Difference."
Criscito added that she hopes
the club will continue to main-
tain its presence on campus
after she graduates.

Heir apparent
removed from his
position at BSkyB
LONDON (AP) - Once his
father's heir apparent, James
Murdoch stepped down yester-
day as chairman of British Sky
Broadcasting, surrendering one
of the biggest jobs in the Murdoch
media empire in a bid to distance
the broadcaster from a deepening
phone hacking scandal.
James Murdoch's credibility
and competence have come under
severe questioning because of the
phone hacking crisis and alleged
bribery by British newspapers
while he was in charge, and he faces
further questioningin the scandal.
"I am aware that my role as
chairman couldbecome a lightning
rod for BSkyB and I believe that my
resignation will help to ensure that
there is no false conflation with
events at a separate organization,"
the 39-year-old Murdoch said.
Yesterday's announcement was
just the latest in a string of setbacks
for James Murdoch, who has been
shedding titles since the scandal
heated up.
At the end of February, he quit
as chairman of News Internation-
al, the company's troubled British
newspaper subsidiary, a move cast
as allowing Rupert Murdoch's
younger son to focus on News
Corp.'s extensive TV holdings. He
has also stepped down from the
boards of auctioneer Sotheby's
and pharmaceutical firm GlaxoS-
mithKline PLC.
Nicholas Ferguson, formerly
deputy chairman, moved up to
replace the younger Murdoch as
chairman at BSkyB. Tom Mock-
ridge, who recently replaced James
Murdoch at the helm of News
International, gained a new title of
deputy chairman of BSkyB.
James Murdoch retains his roles
as deputy chief operating officer of
News Corp. and chairman and CEO
of the company's international divi-
sion. He also remains on the BSkyB
board as a non-executive member.
"James Murdoch is avery good
TV man. I think people there will

regret his passing," said Paul Con-
new, a media consultant and for-
mer tabloid editor. "The bigger
question it raises is, where does
this leave News Corp. in relation to
BSkyB?"
The phone hackingscandal has
already effectively killed a bidby
News Corp. to take full control of
BSkyB and raised questions about
the Murdoch empire's fitness to
control the satellite broadcaster
through the 39 percent share it
already holds.
The junior Murdoch's resigna-
tion comes a month after Britain's
communications regulator, Ofcom,
said it was monitoring the hacking
and briberyinvestigationtobe sure
that BSkyB was "fit and proper" to
hold abroadcasting license.
The "fit and proper" test looks
at the conduct of individuals who 0
control and manage the company.
James Murdoch's resigna-
tion could either pave the way for
News Corp.to divestBSkyB or take
another run attaking full control of
it, said Todd Juenger, a New York-
based media company analyst with
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.
But because there would likely
be an uproar of opposition in Brit-
ain to the latter, the more likely
reason was simply to remove
the shadow cast by the younger
Murdoch's troubles and allow
the company to operate free from
distractions.
"Because of some baggage
attached to Mr. (James) Murdoch,
that was harder to do with him in
that role," Juenger said.
BSkyB shares were down as
much as 1 percent yesterday at
675.5 pence after its news chan-
nel, Sky News, was first to report
Murdoch's departure. In New
York, News Corp. shares were
down 3 cents at $19.89 in late
afternoon trading.
More embarrassment could
come later this month when the
House of Commons Committee
on Culture, Media and Sport is
expected to publish its report on
the phone hacking scandal. Both
Murdochs are also likely to face a
further appearance before a judge-
led inquiry into phone hackingand
journalism practices in general.

Your future never looked brighter.

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
City council holds
off on financial
package from state
The Detroit City Council has
deferred a vote on a consent
agreement between Detroit and
Gov. Rick Snyder.
Council's decision yester-
day means members could still
return today to vote on whether
to authorize a revamped finan-
cial stabilization agreement that
could stave off state receivership.
The agreement would have
to be authorized by a financial
review team that's been ordered
by an Ingham County judge not
to meet. State officials filed a
challenge yesterday to that order
with the Michigan Court of
Appeals..
But time may be running out
for Detroit's elected leaders to
retain any control over the city's
finances. Snyder has until Thurs-
day to decide if Detroit will get
an emergency manager.
DALLAS
Tornadoes tear
through Texas
Several reported tornadoes
tore through the Dallas area yes-
terday, tossing semis in the air
and leaving crumpled tractor
trailers strewn along highways
and in truck stop parking lots.
The National Weather Service
reported at least two separate
"large and extremely dangerous"
tornadoes south of Dallas and
Fort Worth. Dallas Police spokes-
woman Sherri Jeffrey said an
apparent twister touched down
and caused damage within the
city's southern limits.
Officials had no immediate
information about injuries.
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti
Cholera a concern
in Haiti as rainy
season begins
Haiti is seeing a jump in the
number of cholera cases as the
Caribbean nation heads into the
annual rainy season, a United
Nations humanitarian agency
said yesterday.
The U.N.'s Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian
Affairs said in a monthly bulletin
that the new cholera cases were
found in the western and north-
ern parts of the country and that
Haitian health officials recorded
77 new cases a day for the whole
country in early March, when
the rains began.
Medical teams have been
deployed to stem the spread of
cholera but their effectiveness
has been hampered in part by lit-
tle coordination and an absence
of salaries paid to people work-
ing in cholera treatment centers
run by Haitian authorities, the

U.N. bulletin said.
0 PARIS
Islamist group
planned to kidnap
French judge
Preliminary charges are
being filed against 13 Islamist
radicals in France, a prosecu-
tor announced yesterday, saying
some had been calling for Mus-
lim Shariah law in the country,
stashing weapons and hatching
plots, one to kidnap a judge.
Prosecutor Francois Molins
told a news conference that
members of the Forsane Alizza
group received physical train-
ing in parks and forests around
Paris and religious indoctrina-
tion "in order to take part in a
jihad," or holy war. The group
preached hate and violence
on their Internet site which
"called for an Islamic caliphate
in France, the application of the
Shariah and incited Muslims to
unite to prepare for civil war,"
Molins said.
The site, which also showed
clips of late al-Qaida leader
Osama bin Laden, was shut down
after authorities banned Forsane
Alizza in March.

Obama said things could be
worse - and predicted they
would be if Romney and Repub-
licans got their way.
In a speech to the annual
meeting of The Associated
Press, he said a House-passed
budget written by Republicans
was "antithetical to our entire
history as a land of opportunity
and upward mobility for every-
body who's willing to work for it
Itis aprescription for decline."
When he wasn't focusing his
rhetoric on Obama, Romney
prodded Santorum to quit the
race, suggesting a refusal to do
so could cost the party the elec-
tion in November.
"The rightnthing for us, I think,
is to get a nominee as soon as
we can and be able to focus on
Barack Obama," Romney said
in an interview with Fox News.
"You have to remember that it
was Ross Perot that allowed Bill
Clinton to win"in 1992, he added,
a reference to the Texan who ran
as an independent that year.
Santorum, in his home state
of Pennsylvania, took note of the
calls for him to exit the race.
"Ladies and gentleman, Penn-
sylvania and half the other peo-
ple in this country have yet tobe
heard, and we're going to go out
and campaign here and across
this nation to make sure that
their voices are heard in the next
few months."
For Romney, the end of the
contested primary campaign
could hardly come soon enough.
Obama has gained in the polls
in recent months, particularly
among women, as Republicans
vie among themselves for sup-
port from a conservative party
electorate.

Obama's comments on health
care proceedings angers judge

Texas jurist
enfuriated Obama
criticized court
before ruling
HOUSTON (AP) - A federal
appeals court judge yesterday
seemed to take offense to com-
ments President Barack Obama
made earlier this week in which
he warned that if the Supreme
Court overturned his signature
health care overhaul it would
amount to overreach by an
"unelected" court.
The Supreme Court is set to
issue a ruling later this year on
whether to strike down some or
all of the historic health care law.
During oral arguments in
Houston in a separate challenge
to another aspect of the federal
health care law, U.S. 5th Circuit
Court of Appeals Judge Jerry
Smith said Obama's comments
troubled a number of people who
have read them as a challenge to
the authority of federal courts.
"I'm referring to statements
by the president in the past
few days to the effect, I'm sure
you've heard about them, that
it is somehow inappropriate
for what he termed unelected

judges to strike acts of Congress
that have enjoyed, he was refer-
ring of course to Obamacare, to
what he termed a broad consen-
sus and majorities in both houses
of Congress," Smith told Dana
Kaersvang, an attorney with the
Justice Department in Washing-
ton, D.C.
On Monday, Obama issued a
direct challenge to the Supreme
Court, saying he didn't believe
the high court would take the
"unprecedented" step of over-
turning a law passed by a strong
majority of Congress.
"I want to be sure that you
are telling us that the Attorney
General and the Department of
Justice do recognize the author-
ity of the federal courts through
unelected judges to strike acts of
Congress or portions thereof in
appropriate cases," Smith said.
A somewhat surprised Kaers-
vang told Smith the Justice
Department does recognize this
power by the courts and made
reference to a landmark 1803
case that formed the basis for
judicial review.
However, Smith ordered
Kaersvang to submit a letter to
the appeals court by tomorrow

Uphold health reform
The Affordable Care Act is constitutional
Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court spent three days hearing
arguments regarding the constitutionality of the Patient Pro-
tection and Affordable Care Act. It's unclear how the court
will rule, but any decision will have massive national impacts. Of the
three days of hearings, one was spent debating the legality of an indi-
vidual mandate and another on whether or not the federal govern-
ment can force states to raise Medicaid benefits. The Supreme Court
should uphold President Barack Obama's health care reform law due
to the constitutionality of the individual mandate and the federal gov-
ernment's ability to regulate Medicaid.

'The Best and the Brightest'

ne of the best books I've
read provides a powerful
lesson in the pitfalls that
come from great
intelligence and
ability. David
Halberstam's
"The Best and
the Brightest"
tells the story of
certifiably bril-
liant people who SETH
took the United SODERBORG
States to war,
dug in deeper as
things got worse and never internal-
ized messages coming fromthe front
- messages that might have weak-
ened their resolve to send Ameri-
cans to die in a far-off country.
Halberstam's book is about the
Vietnam War. Though a work of
history, it - like other great histo-
ries of conflict - serves as a par-
able. The men involved - they
were all men back then - included
McGeorge Bundy, former dean of
the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at
Harvard University; Robert McNa-
mara, a Harvard Business School
graduate and former Ford Motor
Co. president; a young Harvard law
professor named John McNaughton
and Daniel Ellsberg, the Harvard-
educated aide to McNamara whose
eventual publication of thousands
of secret documents proved that
deception of the American public
had been central to the war's prog-
ress. President John F. Kennedy,
who appointed these men, was him-
self a Harvard graduate.
The lesson of "The Best and the
Brightest" is that mental agility
can be a trap. Smart people can fit
new information into the narra-
tives they have already constructed
- because they are so good at fitting
ideas together, it can be exceed-
ingly difficult for them to recog-
nize when facts call assumptions
into question. A person with great
talent for abstraction can fit round

pegs into square holes, something
he or she accomplishes by proving
to himself or herself that the peg is
square or the hole is round, or that
both are somewhere in between.
When commonly held assump-
tions shape quick thinkers' percep-
tions, they, more than others, have
the ability to protect those assump-
tions from facts. The hardest person
to convince that, say, the domino
theory of international communism
might not make sense, is the person
with the mental dexterity to show
that evidence against the theory
is in fact no evidence at all. Yet at
the same time, such a mind is fully
capable of switching from one set of
assumptions to another and, being
comfortable with abstractions, may
find it hard to recognize which nar-
rative is actually worth pursuing.
It is easy to switch from knowing
that the peg is self-evidently round
to knowing that the peg is self-evi-
dently square - someone who can
do that has a hard time knowing
when it's important to choose -
and stick up for - a firm conclusion.
Thus one reads of McNaughton,
"No one in the high levels of gov-
ernment in 1964 had greater and
more profound doubts about the
wisdom of the policy the nation
was following in vietnam, and no
one argued more forcefully with
his immediate superior against the
particular course. And having lost
that argument, when someone else
... made the same points ... no one
tore those arguments apart more
ferociously."
Qualities that help a person
reach high office sometimes make
them unable to bring a critical eye
to their position. People whose
approaches to problem solving have
brought them success often lack the
ability to question whether their
approach is appropriate for the task
at hand. Itis, after all, their mastery
of procedures that brings them to
positions of public trust.

Former Defense Secretary Rob-
ert McNamara is notorious for
spending the vietnam War at his
desk, poring over statistical reports,
unable - because of his training and
success - to ask whether the num-
bers measured anything useful, or
were even honest. They weren't.
When he finally understood that, he
became one of the strongest voices
speaking out againstthe war within
the administration. Yet it was his
decisions, made on premises he'd
failed to question, that created the
Sometimes, those

can't be critical.
quagmire in the first place.
The most important questions
are about assumptions. Without an
understanding of the premises on
which a decision is being made, it is
almost impossible to sense whether
the narratives you've imposed have
in turn limited your ability to see
other possible outcomes. The trage-
dy of "The Best and the Brightest" is
that brilliant men failed to see how
their own abilities could keep them
from asking the right questions.
Those of you who hope someday
to make important decisions owe it
to yourselves - and to the people
whose lives your decisions will
affect - to read this book, think
deeply about it and learn to ques-
tion your own assumptions. In that
endeavor, the best and brightest
among you will have to work the
hardest.

Each of the Supreme Court's hearings
debated one of the three elements of the
Affordable Care Act. The first hearing on
Monday, March 26 was focused on whether
or not the court should debate the law now,
or wait for it to take effect in 2014. Tuesday's
hearing contended the legality of the federal
government's ability to force states to raise
the income level for collecting Medicaid ben-
efits - a vital piece of the legislation that if
upheld will provide healthcare coverage for an
estimated 17 million Americans. Wednesday's
hearing was focused on the most controver-
sial element of the Affordable Care Act: the
mandate that would force those unwilling to
purchase health insurance to pay a fine. After
three days of debate, the court will deliberate
and release its decision sometime in June.
The health care reform law would require
states to offer Medicaid healthcare coverage
to all legal residents whose income is less than
33 percent above the federal povertylevel. This
will cause states to incur significant costs, but
the federal government will pay for any new
costs that are associated with the law until
2019. After 2019, the federal government will
still pay for 90 percent of any new Medicaid
costs that states incur due to the Affordable
Care Act. The 1987 Supreme Court case South
Dakota v. Dole reaffirmed the federal govern-
ment's authority to pressure states to accept
legislation as long as the new law "promoted
general welfare" and the federal government
paid for any additional costs. The coverage of
17 million low-income Americans is undoubt-
edly promoting the "general welfare" and is

protected by the Constitution.
Mandating Americans to buy health insur-
ance is not only necessary for driving the cost
of insurance down in the United States, but
it's also entirely constitutional and should
be upheld by the Supreme Court. If everyone
bought health insurance, the overall pooled
cost would go down, making it more affordable
for all Americans to be covered. This cost-con-
trolling mechanism is constitutional according
to the 1942 Supreme Court decision in Wickard
v. Filburn. This case states that the commerce
clause of the Constitution grants the federal
government the ability to regulate an indi-
vidual's choices if those choices, on an aggre-
gate level, affect the national economy. By not
purchasing health insurance, an individual is
affecting the market of an interstate good. The
federal government has the authority to regu-
late interstate commerce and is constitutional-
ly granted the power of mandating individuals
to purchase health insurance.
The Affordable Care Act is fully constitu-
tional and should be upheld by the Supreme
Court. According to the organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development, the
United States currently spends approximately
16 percent of its gross domestic product ion
healthcare, more than any other developed
nation. Yet in overall healthcare quality, the
World Health Organization ranked America
a dismal 37th out of about 191 nations. If the
Supreme Court upholds the law, the Afford-
able Care Act has the potential to correct many
of the inherent problems of the American
healthcare system.

Ju dici1al restraint

SAMANTHA VREDEVELD I
Modern- day slavery

There's been quite a bit of criticism lately
regarding what the media is, or is not, cov-
ering. It's safe to say that such criticism will
always exist, especially given Americans'
right to free speech. Today, the news and
media markets have expanded, allowing for
any individual with Internet access to express
their opinions for millions upon millions to
see. Controversy over the Trayvon Martin
case and the Kony 2012 video and their preva-
lence in social media have skyrocketed, yet
discourse on the issues themselves seems to
have ceased to exist almost as soon as it began.
I am not interested in providing yet another
argument as to why social media is being over-
used and abused, or which one topic should
rise to the top of the trending list on Twitter.
Instead, Iam interested in the implications on
human life that exist when we choose not to
tweet about certain topics or post a link to our
Facebook walls.
Today, there are more slaves in the world
than there have ever been in human history,
including during the entire Transatlantic
Slave Trade. There are presently 27 million
slaves in the world, about 80 percent of whom
are victims of sex trafficking and, contrary to
popular belief, they are not solely in the devel-
oping world. By casting off 27 million people
as anissue of the developing world,Americans
are able to turn a blind eye to the $10 billion
sex trafficking industry in this very country.
Perhaps the reason as to why this is not a
"trending" topic is ignorance. Perhaps most
Americans - college students included - are
simply unaware of this issue. In that case, I
think awareness and education are some of
the most important things any student can do
to fight human sex trafficking. Once aware of
the issue, however, it is likely that interest will
slowly fade, as it has with Kony 2012 and as it
likely will with Trayvon Martin. In this likely
event, action is what is truly needed.
Presently, 15-, 16- and 17-year-olds are
treated as criminals if they are involved in

prostitution, yet studies show that the vast
majority of these prostitutes are victims of
trafficking. Average entry into prostitution
occurs around the age of 13, dispelling the
popular belief that prostitutes sell themselves
by choice. Sex trafficking has been defined by
the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Pro-
tection Act of 2000 as "the recruitment, har-
boring, transportation, provision, or obtaining
of a person for the purpose of a commercial
sex act" through the use of force, fraud or
coercion. Now, more than ever, there is a need
for Americans to become involved in the fight
for justice for victims of sex trafficking, espe-
cially in the fight for safe harbor inclusion in
the law. Historically, efforts to stop sex traf-
ficking have consisted of punishing the vic-
tim. Rarely, if ever, have efforts been made to
bring justice for victims and punish the true
perpetrators of these crimes - the pimps and
the consumers - and this must change. On
Thursday, from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m., there will
be a letter-writing event in room B770 of the
School of Social Work in which students and
community members will have the opportu-
nity to come at any time that evening to write
letters directly to their congressional repre-
sentatives. This is a simple and easy way for
individuals to make a difference.
Currently, there is only one student orga-
nization fighting for justice for those who
are victimized by sex trafficking. Interna-
tional Justice Mission is doing wonderful
things here on campus to educate students
and seek justice, but it cannot do this work
alone. Across history, some of the greatest
revolutions for political and social reform
have begun on college campuses, and this is
our chance to spark that change once again.
A voice will fall flat when spoken alone. It is
the role of the populous to make change, and
united, we as a campus can fight for justice for
victims of domestic human sex trafficking.

ast Friday, the Roberts Court
forever cast its legacy as it
deliberated over the consti-
tutionality of Obama's Affordable
Care Act. So
far, this court's
decisions have
defined it as
partisan and
sometimes judi-
cially active. If
it continued that
trend through
last week, 40 SARAH
million Ameri- ROHAN
cans would
remain without
health coverage, despite the legisla-
tion's constitutionality.
Judicial activism - or lack of judi-
cial restraint - occurs when the judi-
ciary takes a quasi-legislative role
by using its power to either cerate
or upset legislation, often motivated
by partisan political considerations.
In its early years, the U.S. Supreme
Court was intended to be a body
which practiced judicial restraint.
The Constitution, not party affilia-
tion, was to be the basis of deciding
the legality of a particular piece of
legislation. However, the days of judi-
cial restraint seem long forgotten in
today's Supreme Court.
The Roberts Court is comprised
of a five-justice conservative bloc
and a four-justice liberal bloc. So,
when cases have a 5-4 outcome, it's
often indicative of political divi-
siveness. In 2010, 16 of the 80 cases
reviewed by the Roberts Court had a
5-4 outcome, reflecting a politically
discordant court.
Ironically enough, judicial
restraint is an ideal promoted far
more by conservatives than by lib-
erals. Chief Justice John Roberts
has admitted he sees the role of the
court as necessarily narrow, telling
the New York Times on Aug. 3, 2005,
"Judges must constantly be aware
that their role, while important, is
limited ... They do not have a com-
mission to solve society's problems,
as they see them, but simply to decide
cases before them according to the

rule of law." However, if the Supreme
Court chooses to strike down the
Affordable Care Act, solving "soci-
ety's problems" - or rather sustain-
ing them - is exactly what his court
will be doing.
The issue at the heart of the case
is whether Congress has the power
under the Constitution to enact an
"individual mandate," requiring
citizens to purchase health cover-
age or be penalized. "Can you cre-
ate commerce in order to regulate
it?" Justice Anthony Kennedy asked
Solicitor General Donald Verrilli,
who argued to uphold the legisla-
tion during the hearings. Well, yes
actually, if history has anything to
say about it.
The historical precedent for the
creation of commerce by Congress
was not lost on Justice Stephen Brey-
er, who cited the National Bank as an
example of something "which was
created out of nothing to create other
commerce out of nothing." Based on
this, Breyer concluded during the
hearing, "It seems pretty clear that if
there are substantial effects on inter-
state commerce, Congress can act."
Opponents of the bill, such as
Justice Antonin Scalia, wondered
then how far the Commerce Clause
extends posing critically during the
hearing, "everybody has to buy food
sooner or later, so you define the mar-
ket as food, therefore, everybody is in
the market; therefore, you can make
people buy broccoli.".
If we know anything about the
failing healthcare system in this
country we know it's far different
from other free-market enterpris-
es, like buying groceries. Two of
the various distinctions addressed
in last week's court proceedings
are asymmetrical information and '
adverse selection.
Unlike other areas of the mar-
ket in healthcare the buyer doesn't
know what he is shopping for. He is
told what he needs by a specialist in
healthcare. Patients come to doctors
for the precise reason that they do
not know what they need, only that
they need something. This is asym-

metrical information.
Adverse selection is what pri-
marily accounts for the econom-
ic instability of our healthcare
system. It occurs when healthy
insurance buyers discontinue cov-
erage as rates go up to cover insured
unhealthy consumers. In turn, pre-
miums go up even more causing the
few remaining healthy consumers
to stop paying the disproportion-
al insurance costs. By requiring
everyone to purchase insurance,
the Affordable Care Act attempts to
stop this detrimental cycle.
The Constitution

should be the
basis for legality.

01

These two distinctions may pro-
vide the limiting principal that the
conservative justices were looking
for to explain why requiring the pur-
chase of health coverage is a con-
stitutionally valid exercise, but the
purchase of broccoli is not.
Though my suspicions tell me
the Supreme Court will sadly
overturn health care reform in
yet another 5-4 decision, such an
outcome will likely be perceived
by the American public as having
been a political, rather than con-
stitutional analysis. As Scalia asked
facetiously, "Is there any chance
at all that 26 States opposing [the
ACA] have Republican governors
and all of the states supporting it
have Democratic governors? Is that
possible?" The courtroom crowd
laughed in response because this
landmark case has boiled down to
one of Republican v. Democrat. It's
so absurd that it's almost funny - if
you're not one of the 40 million of
us who ends up without healthcare.

Coup leader in Mali scorns
international condemnation

A week ahead of cease fire,
Syria troops begin pull out

Sanogo calls for
constitutional
convention
BAMAKO, Mali (AP) - The
day after an embargo was placed
on Mali, the soldier who led a
recent coup said yesterday that
he agrees with restoring consti-
tutional order, but first Mali's ills
need to be addressed by holding
a national convention which will
decide on the bestway forward.
With Capt. Amadou Haya
Sanogo refusing to step down,
surrounding nations have
imposed severe financial sanc-
tions on Mali, includingthe clos-
ing of the country's borders and
the freezing of its account at the
regional central bank.
The embargo went into effect
overnight Monday, after Sanogo
failed to meet the 72-hour dead-
line imposed by the Economic
Community of West African
States, or ECOWAS, which had
demanded he hand power to
civilians immediately.
In his first comments since the
sanctions were imposed, Sanogo
invited Malians to join him at a
convention tomorrow - a con-
vention hehad earlier announced
would decide on the type of tran-
sitional body will govern Mali,
before new elections are held.
"Yes to the return to a con-

stitutional order, but with a new
Mali. Our Mali is sick in the

effect, we invite the entire politi-
cal class and all the actors of
society to come without excep-
tion to the national convention,"
Sanogo said.
"We dare hope that our fathers
at ECOWAS will take note of the
decisions and conclusions of
this convention, with the end of
liberating the country from this
impasse."
Mali's neighbors are hoping
the embargo will economically
suffocate the junta. Until that
happens, it's likely to cause great
strain to Mali's population of
over 15 million.

the size of France - imports all of
its fuel, which is trucked in from
neighboring Ivory Coast and
Senegal, both located on Africa's
Atlantic Coast.
The country's electricity grid
is also expected to falter. April is
one of the hottest months of the
year in Mali, and the hydropow-
er system is unable to carry the
load because of low water levels.
Fuel is used in the hot months to
run diesel generators.
Mali's president was sent into
hiding on March 21when agroup
of disgruntled soldiers mutinied

at a military base located around
10 kilometers (6 miles) from the
presidential palace, and then
marched on the seat of govern-
ment. In a matter of hours, they
had succeeded in reversing more
than two decades of democracy.
Rebels fighting a three-month-
old insurgency took advantage of
the power vacuum and have since
effectively wrested control of the
northern half of the country.

Withdrawal will be
complete by April,
10 deadline
BEIRUT (AP) - Syrian troops
began pulling out yesterday from
some calm cities and headed
back to their bases a week ahead
of a deadline to implement an
international cease-fire plan, a
government official said.
The claim could not imme-
diately be verified and activ-
ists near the capital Damascus
denied troops were leaving
their area. They said the day the
regime forces withdraw from
streets, Syria will witness mas-
sive protests that will overthrow
the government.
"Forces began withdrawing
to outside calm cities and are
returning to their bases, while in
tense areas, they are pulling out
to the outskirts," the government
official told The Associated Press
in Damascus without saying
when the withdrawal began. He
spoke on condition of anonymity
because he was not authorized to
talk to the media.
President Bashar Assad agreed
just days ago to an April 10 dead-
line to implement international
envoy Kofi Annan's truce plan. It
requires regime forces to with-
draw from towns and cities and
observe a cease-fire. Rebel fight-
ers are to immediately follow by
ceasing violence.
Khaled al-Omar, an activist in
the Damascus suburb of Saqba,
denied that any withdrawal was
under way in his area.
"This is impossible. I can see

a checkpoint from my window,"
he said via Skype, adding the
regime forces were still in the
main square.
Earlier in the day, opposi-
tion activists charged that the
regime was racing to crush
opponents ahead of the cease-
fire deadline by carrying out
intense raids, arrests and shell-
ing yesterday.
Opposition activists have
blasted Annan's plan as too
little, too late and are particu-
larly angry that it does not call
for Assad to leave power - the
central demand of the uprising.
They suspect Assad will manipu-
late the plan and use it to stall for
time while his forces continue to
crack down.
"He thinks he can win more
time to take control of all Syr-
ian cities," activist Adel al-Omari
said by phone from the southern
town of Dael, where regime forc-
es have been torching activists'
homes since they raided on Mon-
day. "This won't happen, because
as soon as he withdraws his
tanks from the cities, the people
will come out and push to topple
the regime."
Western leaders have cau-
tiously accepted the April 10
deadline while pointing out that
Assad has broken previous prom-
ises and insisting the regime
must be judged by its actions.
Also yesterday, Amnesty
International said people are
still being arrested across Syria,
including 13 students who were
beaten at their school in the
Damascus suburb of Daraya.
The organization said it
received the names of 232 indi-

viduals, including 17 children,
who were reported to have been
killed since Syria agreed to the
plan on March 27.
"The evidence shows that
Assad's supposed agreement
to the Annan plan is having no
impact on the ground," said
Suzanne Nossel, executive direc-
tor of Amnesty International
USA.
She said the government must
release thousands of prisoners,
stop arrests and halt violence
"Otherwise, the only conclu-
sion we can draw is that Syria
has made empty promises once
more," Nossel said.
Russia's Foreign Ministry
said yesterday that Syria had
informed its close ally Moscow
that it has started implementing
the plan. The ministry's state-
ment did not say which troops -
if any - had been withdrawn or
provide further details. It called
on rebel forces to follow suit.
The Syrian government has
not commented publicly on the
April 10 deadline. It has accept-
ed other peace plans in recent
months only to ignore them on
the ground. An Arab League
effort that included sending in
monitors to promote a cease-fire
collapsed in violence in Novem-
ber.
It also remains unclear
whether rebel forces fighting
government troops under the
banner of the Free Syrian Army
would respect a cease-fire. Doz-
ens of local militias in different
parts of the country have only
loose links to each other and to
their official leadership in Tur-
key.

New U.N. report finds 2.4 million
human trafficking victims globally

Document cites
poor training for
* law enforcement as
exacerbating issue
UNITED NATIONS (AP) -
The U.N. crime-fighting office
said yesterday that 2.4 million
people across the globe are vic-
tims of human trafficking at any
one time, and 80 percent of them
are being exploited as sexual
slaves.
Yuri Fedotov, the head of the
U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime,
told a daylong General Assembly
meeting on trafficking that 17
percent are trafficked to perform
forced labor, including in homes
and sweat shops.
He said $32 billion is being
earned every year by unscrupu-
lous criminals running human
trafficking networks, and two
out of every three victims are
women.
Fighting these criminals "is a
challenge of extraordinary pro-
portions," Fedotov said.
"At any one time, 2.4 mil-
lion people suffer the misery of
this humiliating and degrading
crime," he said.
According to Fedotov's Vien-
na-based office, only one out of
100 victims of trafficking is ever
rescued.
Fedotov called for coordi-
nated local, regional and inter-
national responses that balance

"progressive and proactive law
enforcement" with actions that
combat "the market forces driv-
ing human trafficking in many
destination countries."
Michelle Bachelet, who heads
the new U.N. agency promot-
ing women's rights and gender
equality called UN Women, said
"it's difficult to think of a crime
more hideous and shocking than
human trafficking. Yet, it is one
of the fastest growing and lucra-
tive crimes."
Actress Mira Sorvino, the
U.N. goodwill ambassador
against human trafficking, told
the meeting that "modern day
slavery is bested only by the ille-
gal drug trade for profitability,"
but very little money and politi-
cal will is being spent to combat
trafficking.
"Transnational organized
crime groups are addinghumans
to their product lists," she said.
"Satellites reveal the same
routes moving them as arms and
drugs."
Sorvino said there is a lack
of strong legislation and police
training to combat trafficking.
Even in the United States "only
10 percent of police stations have
any protocol to deal with traf-
ficking," she said.
M. Cherif Bassiouni, an emer-
itus law professor at DePaul
University in Chicago, said to
applause that "there is no human
rights subject on which govern-
ments have said so much but
done so little."

Laws in most of the world
criminalize prostitutes and
other victims of trafficking but
almost never criminalize the
perpetrators "without whom
that crime could not be per-
formed," he said.
Bassiouni said the figure of 2.4
million people trafficked at any
time is not reflective of the over-
all problem because "at the end
of 10 years you will have a signif-
icantly larger number who have
gone through the experience."
He urged a global reassess-
ment of "who is a victim and
who is a criminal" and called for
criminalizing not only those on
the demand side using trafficked
women, children and men, but
all those in the chain of supply-
ing trafficking victims.
In addition, Bassiouni said,
"we must change attitudes of
male-dominated police depart-
ments throughout the world who
place this type of a crime at the
lowest level of their law enforce-
ment priorities."
General Assembly President
Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser and
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon
urged donors to contribute to a
new trust fund aimed at helping
victims of human trafficking.
At the start of the meeting,
Fedotov said the U.N. Voluntary
Trust Fund for Victims of Traf-
ficking had pledges of around $1
million but just $47,000 in con-
tributions, and he urged those
who offered money to send their
checks.

Hollande and
Sarkozy close in
polls as voting
approaches
PARIS (AP) - French presi-
dential candidate Francois
Hollande, leading in polls but
lacking in ideas that stick in
voters' minds, finally dropped
a bombshell: As president, he
would levy a 75 percent tax on
anyone who makes more than
1 million ($1.33 million) a year.
The flashy idea from the nor-
mally bland Socialist proved
wildly popular, fanning hostil-
ity toward executive salaries
and forcing President Nicolas
Sarkozy to defend his ostenta-
tious friendships with the rich.
It also unleashed debate in the
French press about whether the
wealthy would decamp for gen-
tler tax pastures.
As much as France likes
the plan, it does not seem to
have assured Hollande's vic-
tory, which, just three weeks
before the first round of voting,
is growing more uncertain as
Sarkozy reaps the benefits of
projecting presidential mettle
following France's shooting
attacks.
Polls put the two men neck-
and-neck in the first round
April 22, and show Sarkozy
gaining on Hollande for the
decisive runoff May 6.
Centrist candidate Francois
Bayrou has dismissed the plan
as absurd - contending that
when all was added up, the top
bracket would be taxed at near-
ly 100 percent. Many econo-
mists are also scratching their

heads over the tax - seeing it
as dangerous at worst and inef-
fective at best - and even Hol-
lande admits it's not meant to
balance the budget.
Still, the "Fouquet'shtax" -
so named by some in the press
after the tony restaurant where
Sarkozy celebrated his 2007
presidential win - is riding and
in part fueling a resurgence of
the French left. The tax-the-
rich proposal has garnered as
much as 65 percent approval in
some polls.
All that has helped Hollande,
often perceived as amiable but
uninspiring, to distinguish
himself from his main oppo-
nent, said Jean-Daniel Levy, a
pollster and political analyst.
"Nicolas Sarkozy has a dou-
ble difficulty: On the one hand,
he is perceived as a president
who is close to the rich, which
is not a good sign in France.
And he is also seen as a presi-
dent who oversaw inegalitarian
policies," he said. The tax, he
added, "allows Francois Hol-
lande to take control again and
to paint a negative portrait of
Nicolas Sarkozy."
But there is a danger that
Hollande hit the nerve too well.
Many voters have swept
right past Hollande and into
the camp of far-left candidate
Jean-Luc Melenchon, who has
electrified voters with calls for
a new French revolution and
who some polls say will come
in third or fourth in the first
round of elections. That could
bleed support away from Hol-
lande in the first round, depriv-
ing him of crucial momentum
going into the second one.
Antipathy for the rich is
widespread in France, where

wealth is meant to be discreet
and climbing the social ladder
to build yourself a mansion isn't
a common narrative.
Hollande himself once
famously declared "I do not
like the rich" - a statement that
only boosted his political stand-
ing among those who think
wealth should be redistributed
instead of accumulated.
Following his 75-percent
tax announcement, front
pages treated the rich like
some strange, migrating spe-
cies, declaring that they would
decamp to Belgium if the tax
was put in place. One presiden-
tial candidate, Dominique de
Villepin, himself quite wealthy,
warned France not to "kill
the goose that lays the golden
eggs."
While there is some anec-
dotal evidence to suggest the
wealthy are eyeing the border,
tax lawyer Sandra Hazan said
there's nothing new in rich
people fleeing France. But they
don't pull up the stakes simply
because taxes are high.
"The problem is not the
level of taxation you suffer,"
said Hazan, who heads the tax
department at law firm Salans.
"The problem is when you can-
not anticipate how much you
will be paying."
The French tax code has
long been unpredictable, she
said, but it has become even
more so in recent months. As
Sarkozy's administration has
tried to keep a series of budget
targets that are central to his
credibility and reassure mar-
kets that France can manage
its debt, the number of changes
to tax law have come fast and
furious.

Latin@ event to
showcase diversity

Love explored in'Fall'

Annual performance
fuses many cultures
into Pangea theme
By JOEY STEINBERGER
For the Daily
At the 12th annual Latin@ Cul-
ture Show, University students
will perform dances, poetry,

previous years,
the cultural acts Culture
are not just from ShOW
Latin America.
They're from all Tomorrow
over the world. at7p.m.
The theme Lydia Mendelssohn
of this year's Theatre
show is Pan-
gea. In accor- From $6
dance with that
theme, Latin@ Culture Show will
have other University groups such
as the Amala Dancers - a West
African dance group - and the
Persian Student Assembly repre-
sentingtheir respective cultures.
"Although the emphasis is still
on our culture, we wanted to
embrace a theme that our music
wasn't created out of thin air,"
said LSA sophomore Ramiro
Alvarez, one of the show's pro-
ducers. "It was created from the
influences of the Arab world and
the West African world."
The "@" ending is meant to
represent the Spanish language's
masculine "o" and feminine "a"
suffixes. When spoken, it's called
the "Latina and Latino Culture
Show," a title meant to make the
show gender inclusive.
This language choice high-
lights an important part of the
show's mission, which is to

reduce stigma and raise aware-
ness about marginalized groups
such as undocumented students,
stereotyped as "illegal immi-
grants."
"We want to display the inter-
sectionality of the lives we lead,"
Alvarez said. "On top of being
Latino on campus, you can be
Afro-Latino, who face their own
stigmas in the Latina world. You
can be a member of the queer
community and be Latino, you
can be undocumented and be
Latino. Unfortunately, a lot of
these in societal norm views are
stigmatized."
This year, the Coalition for
Tuition Equality will be pre-
senting a monologue on undocu-
mented students at the show. In
addition to raising awareness
about these groups, the students
who organize the show also give
back to their community, locally
and worldwide.
"We're sponsoring a little girl
in Mexico until she is 18," Alvarez
said. "She is 5 now and ... we're
going to keep up with it every
year and show where she is at."
The group is also working
with a student in the School of
Social Work to bring 40 stu-
dents from Detroit high schools
to Ann Arbor. The students will
learn about applying to college
and financial aid packages. The
LatinÂ® Culture Show is subsi-
dizing tickets for the high-school
students so they can attend.
Students from the show also
did community service in Detroit
recently. While there, they saw
two 7-year-olds who were tal-
ented breakdancers and recruited
them to perform their moves at
the show.
Because Latin culture is so
diverse, there will be an eclectic
range of dances in addition to the

Persian and West African styles.
New York Salsa, Bachata -- atype
of Dominican dance - Mexican
folkloric and other styles will
be performed. The final act is a
secret Brazilian-inspired dance.
"The people who take part (in
the dances) try different things.
We have our Latinos who are
Dominican and they grew up
dancing Merengue and they're
really good at that, but they try
something different like Mexi-
can folkloric," Alvarez said. "We
do have some (people) that join
what they're best at and they
really shine through that during
the show."
The Latin@ Culture Show has
grown immensely since it started
12 years ago.
"We've gone from humble
beginnings," Alvarez explained.
"It started off in the basement of
the League on that little stage. It
was an hour and it was free. Now
it's at the Mendelssohn Theatre
and has almost five hundred peo-
ple in attendance."
The Latin@ Culture Show
aspires to be like Indian Ameri-
can Student Associations' Cul-
tural Show, which has become
one of the largest student-run
cultural shows on the continent.
Reaching that goal will be a chal-
lenge for the Latin@ Cultural
Show because Latina and Latino
students are a small minority on
campus. One of the great ben-
efits of the show is that it helps to
unite this small community.
"I've taken classes specifically
to meet more Latinos," Alvarez
said. "You're so eager to meet
more people that look like you,
that you can speak your native
language with, that you can
complain about the same things
with. This show really brings us
together."

"Next Fall" also
grapples with a homosexual rela-

partnership between two people.
The student organization
Basement Arts is presenting
the dynamic play "Next Fall,"
which concentrates on two men
in a relationship: One is a devout
Christian, the other an atheist.
The play revolves around the
struggles between sex and reli-
gion, but more universally, the
play emphasizes the conflict that
surrounds any relationship.
After a devastating accident,
Luke is placed in the hospital in
critical condition. The play shifts
from the hospital setting to flash-
backs of Luke and Adam over the
course of their five-year relation-
ship. Luke comes from a family of
born-again Christians and even
though he wants to inform his
parents of his sexuality, he feels
ashamed. This creates a constant
discord between him and Adam.

the set is designed to perform a
180-degree flip, where the hos-
pital, painted in a dull, cold gray,
miraculously turns into a lively
yellow-colored apartment. This
bright color matches the change
in atmosphere, as well as emotion
and time. The costumes also aid
in establishing a distinct separa-
tion between the periods in the
play. For instance, Holly, a friend
of Luke and Adam, is an optimis-
tic and vivacious individual, so

contributed to numerous Demo-
crats in the past, she said her
continued support of Obama is
based on his sound handling of
the economic crisis.
"I believe we were in a depres-
sion, not a recession, when he
became president, and you don't
get out of those quickly, but
we're beginning to make prog-
ress," Maynard said.
University President Mary
Sue Coleman's husband Ken-
neth, a political science faculty
associate, was listed as donating
a combined total of $400 to the
Obama campaign between July
2011 and February 2012. Cole-

contribution when contacted by
The Michigan Daily.

porting Romney early in the race,
and is listed as donating $1,000
to the former Massachusetts
governor's campaign on May 16,
2011. Though Richner said his
main reason for support is his
belief that Romney is the most
likely candidate to beat Obama
in the general election, he also
noted that Romney's Michigan
roots and leadership style are
attractive attributes.
"I think Governor Romney
is our best shot at winning the

think our economy needs a new
direction and new leadership. I

The ceremony featured open-
ing remarks by Lt. Col. Allana
Bryantofthe U.S.Army and guest
speaker Col. Graydon Krapohl of
the U.S. Marine Corps.
Krapohl, who was presented
with a football signed by Michi-
gan football coach Brady Hoke,
emphasized the importance of
the four branches of the ROTC
working jointly in his speech.
"It is important to learn about
your sister services," Krapohl
said. "If you're in the Army,

$10,000 to examine the potential
implementation of a zero-waste
program in Michigan Stadium
in connection with the resolu-
tion passed last week supporting
a zero-waste initiative, as part of
an effort to compost and recycle as
much waste as possible.
LSA senior Brendan Campbell,
vice president of CSG, authored
the resolution and said it was part
of a larger movement to improve
the University's standing as
an "environmental steward."

other aspects of this initia-
tive include giving all incoming

lenges of our times," Nadarajan

Rogers wrote in an e-mail
interview yesterday that he thinks
Nadarajan is well equipped to fill a
position that encompasses a wide
range of fields.
"His broad educational back-
ground will serve him well in

ney and an additional $5,000 to
the Every Republican is Crucial
Political Action Committee - an
organization dedicated to elect-
ing a Republican candidate as
president. She did not return
requests for comment.
According to the FEC website,
donors contributing directly to
candidates can only give a maxi-
mum of $2,500 to any one can-
didate in an election cycle, but
anyone can donate unlimited
amounts of money to political
action committees.
Maynard said it's important
to donate directly to candidates
whenever possible. Despite her
own donation, she added that
she is troubled by the amount
of money currently in the cam-
paign process.
"People have to start raising
money from the minute they're
elected, and I think that can
have a negative consequence on
their ability to govern," Maynard
said. "(But) just because I'd pre-
fer public funding for elections,
I'm not going to sit on my hands
while everybody else is raising
dollars ... To play in the ballgame
you're going to have to put the
money in."
Walter Mebane, Jr., a profes-
sorofpolitical science and statis-
tics, agreed, noting the demand
for fundraising from politicians
often directs their time away
from formulating policies.

"They have to talk about
things that they think work at
their fundraising ability, which
usually is very inflammatory,
defensive kind of rhetoric,"
Mebane said. "The question
is whether you want voters to
decide or dollars to decide."
Richner said contributing
money is a necessary exercise of
free speech and a way of encour-
aging involvement in politics.
He said he believes that as long
as politicians and their cam-
paigns are open about where
their money is coming from and
how it's being spent, donating
gives individuals a unique way to
engage and express their politi-
cal views.
"I understand the concerns
people have about the amount
of money in politics, but what is
the solution?" Richner said. "The
solution of restraining speech is
not a good one to me."
While many college students
cannot afford to contribute
financially, Richner and May-
nard agree that it's essential for
young people to get involved in
any way they can.
Maynard recalled the zeal
held by University students dur-
ing the 2008 presidential elec-
tion, and said she hopes this year
will be the same.
"It's an important part of the
Democratic process that stu-
dents engage and support can-
didates with whom they agree,"
Richner said. "Student engage-
ment can shape the views of can-
didates."

ROTC has a "great mutual rela-

especially through the academic
support the University provides
for ROTC members.
"The University has been very
supportive in what we do in our

Garn said. "It's great to be able
to do it on campus here and have

Nursing senior Catherine
White, an Air Force cadet, won
four awards last night, including
the Scabbard and Blade Award,
which is reserved for the top 20
percent of cadets and midship-
men entering their fifth semester
of collegiate studies.
"It was just a really good end
to the school year and a testa-

everyone here has done this
whole year," White said after
the event. "I'm really proud of
everything that everyone else

has done."
Nursing sophomore Kim

for the event.
"These might have been prior

interested in military affairs,"
Kozlowski said. "It's really great
to see all of the support."
After the awards were pre-

with the Commander's Cup.
The Cup is awarded each year
to the branch that has received
the most points during the

including football, soccer, bas-

"It came down to a three-

Students share
experiences being
undocumented
By RENUKA SANTHANA-
GOPALAN
For the Daily
Activism for undocumented
youth in America is one of the
most vocal student-led social
movements on campus, and yes-
terday University students con-
tinued to expand the nationwide
movement.
Five individuals spoke on a
panel atthe Schoolof Social Work
to discuss national immigration
issues and their experiences as
undocumented residents. The
event, hosted by the Social Work
Allies for Immigrant Rights and
the Coalition for Tuition Equal-
ity - a student-led movement
encouraging the University to
adopt more inclusive policies
for undocumented students -
aimed to raise awareness for the
12 million undocumented people
living in the United States.
The youngest panelist, Aket-
zaly Ramirez-Lopez, a Pioneer
High School senior, teared up
while talking about the bullying
she has endured at school and
the lack of support she received
from her teachers.
"Counselors should have
training and be more aware,"
Ramirez-Lopez said in an inter-
view after the event.
All the panelists discussed
their involvement in various
forms of activism, a few have
even taken part in civil disobedi-
ence to gain public recognition.
Panelist Dayanna Rebolledo,

a junior at Marygrove College in
Detroit, said she has participated
in a number of civil disobedi-
ence protests. She was arrested
along with seven other activists
in Georgia for blocking traffic
outside Georgia State Univer-
sity in Atlanta and was detained
for more than 27 hours in iso-
lation with the threat of being
deported, before being eventu-
ally released.
Rebolledo said despite her dif-
ficult situation, she believes acts
like these are necessary to gain
public attention to issues sur-
rounding undocumented resi-
dents.
Franco added that civil dis-
obedience is important because
it is a keyway to get sponsorship,
make a statement, create aware-
ness and prompt legislative
attention.
The panel also discussed the
difficulty of being open about
beingundocumented.
"It was not something I talked
about," Rebolledo said. "I didn't
identify myself as undocument-
ed."
Maria Ibarra, a senior at the
University of Detroit Mercy,
didn't know she was undocu-
mented until her senior year of
high school. She said once she
found out, she was hesitant to be
open about her status because
she was worried about what
would happen to her family.
Many higher education insti-
tutions don't provide in-state
tuition to undocumented stu-
dents, making it difficult for
many to pursue an education.
Ibarra said she had planned to
come to the University, but upon
learning of her undocumented
status, she had to alter her plans.

She added that she needed to
rely on scholarships to pay for
her education and the cost is still
difficult to manage.
The panelists closed by dis-
cussing how the undocumented
youth movement is growing in
the United States, adding that
many states are seeing the emer-
gence of their own movements
advocating for federal aid in
higher education.
The Development, Relief and
Education for Alien Minors Act
proposes citizenship for undocu-
mented youth who meet three
major provisions - the individ-
ual must have relocated to the
United States before the age of
16, be pursuing a higher educa-
tion or military service and must
have lived in the country for at
least five years from the date the
bill is enacted.
"People think it will encour-
age illegal immigration," Ibarra
said. "This isn't true because you
wouldn't qualify."
These groups are also
attempting to challenge the
stigma undocumented youth
face, pointing to the work of the
Coalition for Tuition Equality on
campus.
Ibarra said she hopes the Uni-
versity will take a more active
role in undocumented youth
activism.
Franco agreed, noting that if
the University, implements this
in-state policy, "others will fol-
low its example."
Social Work student Martha
Valadez encouraged students to
take action against the Univer-
sity's "oppressive policies," add-
ing that "an attack against this
community is an attack on all
communities."


in-depth study on the possibil-
ity of making the stadium zero-
waste would cost $15,000, and
the $10,000 pledge is contingent
on the Athletic Department's
commitment to the study.
"It's one thing to say some
words in an assembly meeting,
but it's another thing to put skin
in the game and really show that
we're committed to sustainabil-
ity," Campbell said. "By estab-
lishing this grant, we are making
a strongstatement to the Athletic
Department that students care
about sustainability."
Another resolution passed
instituted new operating proce-
dures for the assembly, which
had been operating under similar
procedures for the past few weeks
to finalize the details, according
to Business senior Matt Eral, the
assembly speaker.
"I think the assembly is now

fully positioned to be a delib-
erative body," Eral said. "I think
that (this) assembly is leaving the
(next) assembly with the right
procedures and format to fully
operate under the new constitu-
tion."
One resolution that dominated
the meeting's discussion con-
cerned the impartiality of CSG
members during elections. The
resolution attempted to prevent
public endorsements of candidates
by members of CSG. Eral said the
resolution, which the assembly
eventually voted against, was not
comprehensive enough and led to
questions about students' rights to
free speech.
"I think that the assembly felt
that the resolution was way too
broad, was not specific enough,
did not properly address the
needs that it was trying to," Eral
said.



challenges and opportunities of
the University of Michigan and
the emergent culture of art and
design," Rogers wrote.
Rogers added that Nadarajan
has the potential to broaden the
scope of the school and introduce
it to the international arena.
"(Nadarajan's) deep under-
standing of the arts, solid
experience as an academic admin-
istrator, and extensive scholarly
accomplishments will undoubted-
ly combine to advance the school
both nationally and internation-
ally," Rogers wrote.
Nadarajan studied at the
National University of Singapore's
Faculty of Arts and Social Sci-
ences, where he received a mas-

ter's degree in social sciences and
anthropology, before obtaining a
master's of arts degree in conti-
nental philosophy from the Uni-
versity of Warwick in the United
Kingdom.
He also served as a senior lec-
turer at the Lasalle College of
the Arts in Singapore in 1996,
the school's dean of visual arts
beginning in 2001 and he was
also appointed Lasalle's founding
dean of research in 2003.
From 2005 to 2008, Nadara-
jan was the associate dean for
research and graduate studies at
Pennsylvania State University.
He then filled the newly-creat-
ed position of vice provost for
research at MICA.

CHRONICLE
From Page 1A
grams," Cunningham wrote. "It's
especially misleading for major
research universities, such as the
University of Michigan, that have
a full range of graduate and pro-
fessional educational programs."
Cunningham wrote that one
of the major reasons the Univer-
sity's costs are higher than peer
institutions is the cost of graduate
programs, which were not differ-
entiated by the Chronicle during
its analysis.
"The total cost of educational
services (the numerator) includes
spending for undergraduates,
graduate degrees, post-master's
certificates, and all doctor-
ates," Cunningham wrote. "The
graduation data (the denomina-
tor) includes only the number of
undergraduate degrees granted.
This calculation will naturally
lead to a higher 'cost of degree'
calculation for any school with a
significant number of graduate
and professional programs."
Michael Van Beek, director of
education policy for the Macki-
nac Center for Public Policy, a
non-profit organization in Mid-
land, Mich., said the University
compared favorably on a national
scale to peer institutions, but still
faced strong competition. Van
Beek cited the University of Cali-
fornia, Berkley's higher gradua-
tion rate, at about 91 percent, and
that it spent significantlyless than
the University for each degree.
"That's really the important
question," Van Beek said. "To get
an 89 percent graduation rate for

six years, does it require $130,000
per completion?"
In general, Van Beek said
smaller schools are more effective
atlimiting costs thanlarger public
institutions because of their abil-
ity to specialize in certain areas.
He cited the liberal arts program
at The College of William and
Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia
as a model of specialization, but
one that isn't easily comparable to
the University.
"The cost to provide every-
thing for all people certainly
would expand what the Univer-
sity would need to spend to do
those things," Van Beek said. "A
school that is more specialized ...
that is focused on liberal arts or a
certain strength in one area may
have the ability to spend less with
that focus, and maybe it's because
they are able to attract students
who would excel in that area."
Van Beek said the data indi-
cated no significant differences
between the funding and effi-
ciency between public and pri-
vate institutions in Michigan.
"On the whole, if you looked at
Michigan, at the private colleges,
they have slightly higher gradua-
tion rates overall for a four-year
period, (but) their spending var-
ies more and it is lower on aver-
age," Van Beek said.
On a national scale, costs at
leading private institutions were
much higher than at the Univer-
sity. Yale University had the high-
est spending per completion at
$502,748, followed by Wake For-
est University at $417,946.
Michigan State University
had the second highest six-year
graduation rate in Michigan at

77.2 percent and the fourth high-
est spending per completion at
$75,738.
Donald Heller, dean of the
College of Education at MSU,
was not familiar with the data,
but cautioned against drawing
conclusions based on graduation
rates and costs alone. The most
important quality, according to
Heller, is the preparedness of the
student entering college in deter-
mining whether or not he or she
will graduate.
"I'd be very cautious about
inferring causality," Heller said.
"The reason for that is that the
institutions that spend more
money are the wealthy institu-
tions which tend to be the more
selective and attract better stu-
dents. We know that the most
important factor that determines
whether astudentgraduatesfrom
college or how quickly they grad-
uate from college is their own
background and characteristics."
Hellersaid itwasn'tparticular-
ly useful to compare large institu-
tions such as the University of
Michigan or MSU to other small-
er Michigan schools because they
have different focuses and sizes.
He added that research institu-
tions across the board have high-
er costs than institutions without
a significant research component.
"It makes very little com-
parison (sense) to compare U-M
Ann Arbor to Eastern Michi-
gan University, for example,"
Heller said. "It's a much more
valid comparison to compare
(the University of Michigan
and Michigan State University)
to other research universities
around the country."

Michigan faces Chippewas in midweek game

F.

Daily Sports Writer
Michigan coach Rich Maloney
talks the talk, but can the base-
ball team refrain from walking
the walks?

ond week in a CMU at

limit the "free-
bies."
Michigan's bullpen will either
lead the team to a much-needed
win or it will be the downfall of
today's matchup against Central
Michigan.
The Wolverines and Chippe-
was (12-16) are almost a mirror
image of one another in every
facet of the game:
Both teams will most like-
ly have young pitchers on the
mound.
Both teams are being piggy-
backed by their top three hitters.
And both teams carry identical
records.
In the balanced matchup,
Maloney is looking "to play the
game (the Wolverines) are capa-
ble of playing - good fundamen-
tal baseball."
At practice yesterday, volun-
teer coach Wayne Welton worked
to clean up those fundamentals,
'while pitching coach Steve Mer-
riman assessed the bullpen for

"Take one pitch at a time," he
said. "Take one at-bat at a time."
But that strategy requires a
productive batting order, some-
thing that has fallen soft and
silent in the last month of play.
The outfielders - Biondi,
freshman Will Drake and soph-
omore Michael O'Neill - have
carried the team. Each hits well
above a .300 average and they
combine for 108 hits and 68 runs.
But the trio can't keep the whole
team afloat on their own.
Even O'Neill has shown symp-
toms of the contagious slump
going around - in the last seven
games, he's gone just 5-for-27.
But Biondi picked up the slack
and still runs on a hot streak,
spearheading the Wolverines
with confidence and a .466 on-
base percentage.
Now he's just waiting for the
others to catch up.
"Baseball is a funny game,"
Biondi said. "You could go out
tomorrow and somebody that's
hitting .200 could go 4-for-4."
Similar to Michigan's lack of
hitting support, Central Michi-
gan's three best hitters also lug
the weight of the offense.

But I'm still optimistic that at
Maloney's game some point, something is going
to happen to spark this team."

Freshman left fielder Will Drake has a team-leading .333 batting average in his first season with the Michigan baseball team.

its potential contenders.
Though Maloney is still
uncertain of who the starting
hurler will be, he knows his bull-
pen will see a lot of action. It will
be a constant rotation with just a
couple innings for each reliever.
Central Michigan posted its
probable pitcher, left-hander
Matt Trowbridge, who has a 4.01
ERA and is looking to record his
fourth win. Meanwhile, Michi-
gan has limited options to pick
from.

Suffering a three-game series
sweep to Minnesota last week-
end, Michigan used up the
majority of its resources - the
pitching staff is looking slim.
Junior center fielder Patrick
Biondi expects freshman right-
hander James Bourque to throw
out the first pitch.
If Maloney is right and the
game comes down to a matter of
walks, Bourque may not be the
best candidate.
In his last 9.1 innings of work,

Bourque has given up 11 walks,
which contributed to the seven
earned runs on the stat sheet.
But there really isn't much of a
choice.
Because Maloney yanked red-
shirt junior left-hander Bobby
Brosnahan and junior right-
hander Ben Ballantine from the
mound in early innings against
the Golden Gophers, two poten-
tial midweek starters are no lon-
ger available.

* of a young pitching staff. Fortu-
nately, that moment didn't last
long.
In a three-game series against
Indiana, the 20th-ranked Wol-
verines (5-1 Big Ten, 21-10 overall)
struggled on the mound in their
split of the first two games but
rebounded nicely in a 7-2 victory
in the finale.
In Saturday's first game, fresh-
man left-hander Haylie Wagner
allowed two earned runs, prompt-
ing freshman right-hander Sara
Driesenga to come in for relief and
close the game.
"My pitches felt kind of flat,"
Wagner said.
But Driesenga felt just the
opposite.
"My drop ball was working
really well," Driesenga said.
The second game saw the
appearance of more than two
pitchers in a single game for the
first time since March, as Driesen-
ga allowed three runs and Wagner
allowed three more.

Carol Hutchins) said that we
didn't deserve to win that game,"
Diresenga said. "We just need to
do our part, and we didn't do it."
Sunday had a completely dif-
ferent outcome, though, as Wag-
ner didn't allow an earned run in
seven innings.
"I came into that game know-
ing yesterday was yesterday, and it
was a new day and a new game,"
Wagner said. "It was a day of com-
ing outand beingready to show my
coaches and my team that I can be
'that' pitcher and I can jump back
from something like that."
Over the weekend, Wagner
and Driesenga acted like veterans
capable of overcoming challeng-
es and coming back stronger at
times. Though Michigan relies on
more than pitching to win games,
Wagner and Driesenga collec-
tively showed how integral they
are to the rest of the team. After
the offense (fifth in the Big Ten),
combined for five runs on Satur-
day, the pitching staff was forced
to step up and control Indiana.
Saturday's games featured a
newly formed pattern, in which
Driesenga relieved Wagner and

much of the season. Often times,
Hutchins uses one to stop oppo-
nents from building momentum
off the other.
"That's what we do for each
other," Wagner said. "We know
that if one of us gets in a tough
situation, then we can come back
and fix it for each other."
Added Driesenga: "We're both
confident in each other. We both
want to finish for ourselves, but it's
good to have the ability to depend
on somebody else too."
Though the Wolverines worked
primarily with two pitchers last
year as well, they will still need
to be concerned about the num-
ber of innings the freshmen rack
up. Wagner and Driesenga have
combined for 204 innings pitched
through Sunday and will likely
pitch close to 400 by season's end.
Former Wolverine Jordan Tay-
lor and senior Stephanie Speier-
man combined for 364 innings by
the end last year's NCAA Super
Regional run.
For Driesenga, though, pain
hasn't been issue.
"I feel fine," Driesenga said.
"There's no soreness at all. Really,

Rotating the young pitchers
keeps them from remaining stiff
during the season. Hutchins and
pitching coach Jennifer Brun-
didge make sure each one of the
freshmen sees enough innings in
order to help them stay consistent
with their command.
Wagner and Driesenga will
continue working on consistency
and maintaining the "one pitch
at a time" mindset that has been
preached to them all season. Dri-
esenga described her season as
taking "two steps forward and
one step back," and the process of
being consistent will likely remain
like that for the season.
"It's about each pitch separate-
ly," Driesenga said. "You go about
it as if each pitch is your last pitch,
and then as soon as that pitch is
over, walk back to the end of the
circle and take a deep breath."
Balancing inexperience with
a high level of performance has
been a challenge for Hutchins this
season, but like her, the pitchers
have noted that winning will be a
team effort.
"I knew, even though I wasn't
throwing my best and that noth-

Wednesday, April 4, 2012 // The Statement 7B

Letter from the Editor
by Terra Molengraff
We all take photos. Constantly. From Instagram
to PhotoBooth to personal cameras, nothing
is safe from our amateur snapshots. These are my
friends. This is my howl of cereal in the morning. We
share the photos we love in albums on Facebook,
upload them to Twitter or Flickr and send them in
text messages.
But once upon a time, the Greeks coined the word
that originates our present understanding of photogra-
phy. Thatword means "drawing with light."
This issue of The Statement is about such draw-
ings. It's about thebest photos in The Michigan Daily
this year. The people who took the photos are artists
whose brush strokes are lens snaps and paints are
light.
Perhaps it's because of our societal obsession with
documenting that we often overlook those ephemeral
moments that can't be Instagrammed and sent along in
a few hundred pixels. They're moments like an athlete
humbled by praise, the aftermath of a natural disaster
or a candlelight vigil.
To capture these moments with resonance and
integrity requires the discerning eye of an artist. It's
this artistry we're honored to share with you here.
