JULY 21: The Ann Arbor Art Fair returns

Former Vice President Joe Biden will 

be the 46th President of the United States, 

according to the Associated Press on 

Saturday. Biden claimed Pennsylvania’s 

20 electoral college votes, leaving him 

with 273 –– more than the 270 needed to 

win the presidency, according to Decision 

Desk. 

Biden has garnered more votes in his 

favor than in any presidential election in 

history, breaking records with more than 

74 million votes.

In an address Friday night, Biden 

preached patience to his supporters.

“My fellow Americans, we don’t have 

a final declaration of victory yet, but the 

numbers tell a clear and convincing story: 

We are going to win this race,” Biden said.

Though Election Day was Tuesday, 

votes in key states including Nevada, 

Arizona, Pennsylvania and Georgia took 

days longer to be counted. 2020 saw 

record turnout and a massive increase 

in the number of absentee ballots cast 

in 2016, with more than 100 million 

Americans casting ballots before Nov. 3.

The Associated Press declared that 

Biden won Michigan’s 16 electoral votes 

Wednesday night, flipping the state 

Trump won in 2016. Biden won 2,795,714 

votes in Michigan, amounting to 50.5 

percent of the vote, beating Trump by 

about two and a half points.

Through the tight race, the Trump 

campaign and supporters attempted 

to cast doubt on election results by 

spreading misinformation on Twitter 

and protesting ballot tabulation. Trump’s 

campaign filed a lawsuit against the 

Michigan Court of Claims earlier on 

Wednesday to halt ballot counting in the 

state, which was dismissed Thursday 

night.

Trump provided no evidence to 

support his allegations about threats 

to election integrity, and in a speech 

Thursday night, he lied repeatedly about 

the vote-counting process in Michigan.

Michigan Democratic Party Chair 

Lavora Barnes defended the security of 

the state’s voting system in a statement 

Wednesday after President Donald 

Trump repeatedly cast doubt on the 

safety and reliability of mail-in ballots. 

“Yesterday Michigan held an election 

with record turnout levels,” the statement 

read. “It takes a considerable amount of 

time and volunteer hours to count every 

single vote. … The voters have cast their 

ballots and they are being meticulously 

counted and when that process is over, all 

Michiganders together will find out the 

results.”

Biden’s campaign has stressed unity 

through hard times and criticized 

Trump’s response to the COVID-19 

pandemic. Biden held rallies in Michigan 

with former President Barack Obama and 

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer days before the 

election, blaming Trump for America’s 

world-topping COVID-19 death rate. 

“Imagine where we would be if we 

had a president who had worn a mask, 

instead of mocked it,” Biden said last 

weekend. “I can tell you this, we wouldn’t 

have 5 million confirmed cases of COVID 

in this nation, we wouldn’t have 230,000 

deaths … He knew and he hid it from the 

people, he knew it was so much worse 

than the flu, he lied to the people. He 

knew it wasn’t going to disappear.”

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., will 

be the first woman of color to occupy 

the vice presidency as a Black and South 

Asian woman.

In 
light 
of 
Governor 
Gretchen Whitmer declaring 
a State of Emergency early 
Tuesday 
morning, 
the 
University 
has 
decided 
to 
cancel all events and classes 
on campus for Wednesday, 
Jan. 29, and intends to resume 
activity at 7 a.m. Friday. This 
will be the third time in 40 
years the school has closed 
due to weather.
The 
University 
Record 
announced 
classes 
were 
canceled 
at 
3:30 
p.m. 
on 
Tuesday.
“The 
University 
of 
Michigan’s Ann Arbor campus 
issued an emergency reduction 
in 
operation 
effective 
at 
midnight Tuesday through 7 
a.m. Friday, due to predicted 
extreme low temperatures and 

wind chills,” The Record said.
The last time the University 
halted 
activity 
was 
in 
February 2015 due to a winter 
storm which resulted in 18 
inches of snowfall. Before 
that, there was a closure in 
2014 due to extremely cold 
temperatures — specifically, 
a wind chill of -30 degrees. 
The first time the University 
closed was in January 1978 
due to climate conditions. 
Weather projections estimate 
a wind chill of nearly -40 
degrees for Wednesday and 
part of Thursday.
Before the announcement 
was 
made, 
University 
Spokeswoman 
Kim 
Broekhuizen 
explained 
the 
University had been working 
with various individuals to 
determine the best action to 
take.
“University 
officials 
are 
working closely with internal 

and 
external 
partners 
to 
monitor 
the 
predicted 
temperature and windchill for 
later this week,” Broekhuizen 
said in an email to The Daily.
The 
decision 
to 
cancel 
classes comes after of closures 
on 
campus 
and 
of 
local 
business around Ann Arbor on 
Monday. University student 
groups, such as the Michigan 
Student 
Power 
Network, 
also took to advocating for 
a campus closure through 
their 
#UMichColdShoulder 
petition, 
which 
currently 
has over 9,000 signatures. 
The petition also encouraged 
students to call University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
as well as other University 
administrators. 
The University joins MSU, 
Wayne 
State 
University, 
among others to cancel classes 
because of extreme weather 
conditions.

ANN ARBOR

Joe Biden wins presidency, 
unseating incumbent 
Donald Trump

University 
of 
Michigan 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
has 
been 
fired 
effective 
immediately 
following 
an 
internal 
investigation 
revealing 
Schlissel’s 
inappropriate behavior with a 
subordinate at the University, 
according to a Saturday press 
release from the Board of 
Regents. 
The decision was made at a 
closed-door Board of Regents 
meeting 
Saturday 
morning 
without a public vote after 
the board hired a third party 
investigator 
to 
determine 
whether or not Schlissel’s 
actions 
as 
president 
had 
violated 
the 
University’s 
supervisor relationship policy.
“It 
is 
with 
great 
disappointment 
that 
we 
announce that the University 
of Michigan Board of Regents 
has 
removed 
Dr. 
Mark 
Schlissel 
as 
President 
of 
the University of Michigan, 
effective immediately,” the 
Board of Regents wrote in a 
Saturday press release.
The 
policy, 
which 
was 
introduced 
in 
July 
2021, 
states that “a Supervisor may 
not, implicitly or explicitly, 
initiate or attempt to initiate 
an 
Intimate 
Relationship 
with a Supervisee over whom 
they 
exercise 
supervisory 
authority,” 
and 
was 
implemented in July 2021 
following allegations former 
Provost 
Martin 
Philbert 
had 
used 
his 
position 
to 
coerce women into sexual 
relationships. 
The 
firing 
comes 
after 
an 
anonymous 
complaint 
submitted on Dec. 8. revealed 
Schlissel had been in an 
inappropriate 
relationship 
with a University employee. A 
subsequent investigation was 
performed which found he 
had used his University email 
account 
to 
inappropriately 
communicate 
with 
said 
employee. 
Schlissel’s existing contract 
contained a morals clause 
which stated his behavior 
as President “be consistent 

with promoting the dignity, 
reputation, 
and 
academic 
excellence of the University.” 
The 
Board 
of 
Regents 
released a letter transmitted to 
Schlissel informing him of his 
termination. In it, the regents 
outlined their justification for 
firing him, citing messages 
sent from his University email 
to a subordinate. Because 
the regents fired Schlissel 
for cause, he will no longer 
receive the golden parachute 
he and the regents negotiated 
when he announced he would 
resign in 2023.
Schlissel 
had 
previously 
provoked the regents’ ire for 
failing to to communicate 
with the board regarding the 
Detroit Center for Innovation. 
Talks broke down between 
donor Stephen M. Ross and 
Dan 
Gilbert, 
who 
owned 
the 
site. 
An 
anonymous 
administration official who 
spoke to the Detroit Free 
Press said the regents felt 
Schlissel left them in the dark 
as negotiations faltered.
In 
October, 
Schlissel 
announced that he would be 
stepping down from the job in 
June 2023, a year earlier than 
planned. The Detroit Free 
Press at the time categorized 
his stepping down early as a 
deal between the members of 
the board who were satisfied 
and 
dissatisfied 
with 
his 
performance. 
The decision was announced 
Saturday 
night. 
A 
press 
release from the University 
announced president emerita 
Mary Sue Coleman will serve 
as interim president. Coleman 
served as president from 2002 
until 2014. 
In a statement posted to 
the Board of Regents website, 
Coleman wrote she was sad 
to learn of the allegations 
against 
Schlissel 
but 
was 
honored to once again be 
leading the University.
“While saddened by the 
circumstances, I am honored 
to be asked to again serve 
the University of Michigan,” 
Coleman wrote. “When I left 
the U-M campus at the end of 
my presidency in 2014, I said 
serving this great university 
was 
the 
most 
rewarding 
experience of my professional 

life. I’m happy to serve again 
in 
this 
important 
interim 
role.” 
The University has hired 
the private law firm Jenner 
& 
Block 
to 
continue 
the 
investigation into Schlissel’s 
behavior. According to the 
Detroit 
Free 
Press, 
the 
firm 
is 
also 
investigating 
whether 
Schlissel 
misused 
University funds to support 
his 
relationship 
with 
the 
unnamed subordinate. 
In an email obtained by the 
Michigan 
Daily 
addressed 
to LSA employees Saturday 
night, LSA Dean Anne Curzan 
wrote she would be meeting 
with fellow deans and senior 
leaders tomorrow and will 
communicate 
additional 
updates in the coming days.
Curzan wrote Schlissel’s 
firing reinforced to need for 
sexual misconduct prevention 
on campus.
“As I process this news, 
it 
only 
strengthens 
my 
commitment 
to 
continuing 
the 
work 
we 
have 
been 
undertaking in the college, 
with 
the 
wise, 
research-
informed 
guidance 
of 
the 
Preventing 
Sexual 
Harassment Working Group,” 
Curzan wrote. “It is essential.”
Jonathan Vaughn, former 
University 
football 
and 
notable survivor of the late 
Doctor Robert Anderson who 
has been camped outside of 
Schlissel’s house for nearly 
100 days in protest of the 
University’s 
handling 
of 
sexual misconduct tweeted 
Schlissel’s firing would help 
create a safer campus. 
“This 
news 
is 
fuel 
for 
my mission: the safety & 
protection of the students 
of this university,” Vaughn 
wrote. “After 99 days of being 
ignored in front of former 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel’s 
home, 
the 
regents 
finally 
made 1 good choice. But there 
must be many more if U-M is 
to be fully accountable.”

UMich President Mark Schlissel 
fired for “inappropriate

‘U’ moves classes online in 
response to coronavirus

The University of Michigan 
announced 
on 
Wednesday 
all 
classes on all three campuses will 
be held online beginning March 16 
through the end of the semester, 
April 21, in response to the COVID-
19 virus. Classes on Thursday and 
Friday will be canceled. However, 
the University will remain open, 
including dorms and dining halls.
In a statement shared on Twitter, 
University President Mark Schlissel 
wrote the changes are meant to 
maximize the safety of the campus 
communities.
“To protect the health and safety 
of our communities and minimize 
the spread of #COVID19, @UMich 
is making changes to classes, travel, 
study abroad and large events on 
our Ann Arbor, @UM_Dearborn 
and @UMFlint campuses,” Schlissel 
wrote.
Events expected to attract more 
than 100 people will also be canceled, 
including 
Honors 
Convocation. 
According to the statement, updates 
about plans for commencement will 
be provided when more information 
is available.
On-campus sporting events will 
be limited to parents and members 
of the press.
All spring and summer study 
abroad 
programs 
through 
the 
University will be canceled, given 
the severity of the outbreak. All other 
University international travel will 
also be suspended, except under rare 
circumstances requiring approval.
The World Health Organization 
declared the COVID-19 outbreak 
a global pandemic Wednesday 
afternoon as the virus continues to 
spread globally.

The move to online classes comes 
a day after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer 
signed an executive order declaring 
a state of emergency following the 
diagnosis of the first two cases of the 
COVID-19 virus in Michigan.
In a press conference Tuesday 
evening, 
Whitmer 
said 
she 
declared the state of emergency to 
maximize efforts and to assist local 
governments and officials in slowing 
the spread of COVID-19.
“We’re taking every step that we 
can to mitigate the virus spread and 
keep Michiganders safe,” Whitmer 
said in the press conference.
The two diagnosed cases in 
Michigan include a middle-aged 
Oakland County woman who has 
recently 
traveled 
internationally 
and a middle-aged Wayne County 
man who has recently traveled 
domestically.
Michigan Medicine announced 
Wednesday morning the hospital is 
treating one of the two confirmed 
Michigan coronavirus cases.
According to the University’s 
webpage on COVID-19, individuals 
should wash their hands often with 
soap for 20 seconds, avoid close 
contact with those who are sick and 
to stay home when sick to prevent 
the spread of the virus.
Prior 
to 
the 
University’s 
decision to move classes online, 
universities across the state had 
already 
suspended 
in-person 
classes. Michigan State University 
suspended 
all 
face-to-face 
classes beginning at noon today, 
MSU President Samuel Stanley 
announced in an email to MSU 
students this morning. Online class 
instruction will last until April 20.
Central 
Michigan 
University 
also asked students not to return 
to campus after spring break and 
announced they will be moving 
their classes online through March 
20. CMU will make a decision on 
whether to continue online classes 

on March 19.
Wayne 
State 
University 
announced Wednesday afternoon 
it will be extending spring break 
until March 23 to help plan for the 
transition to online classes.
Other 
universities 
across 
the United States have called 
off in-person classes this week, 
including Harvard University and 
Ohio State University.
As classes have been canceled 
across the country, some on social 
media have noted the sudden 
requests for students to leave 
campus may be harder to adjust to for 
students who may rely on university 
housing or meal plans. Additionally, 
they said some students may depend 
on work-study as a source of income.
Others have noted students may 
not be able to go home because 
of transportation costs or travel 
restrictions, or because coronavirus 
may be more widespread in that 
location.
Before 
the 
University 
announced the cancellation of 
classes, students on campus began 
creating a spreadsheet of resources 
to help students who may be 
disproportionately impacted by the 
changes.
Michigan Dining sent an email 
to MDining employees Wednesday 
afternoon letting students know 
they plan to continue having food 
available. 
The email stated MDining is 
increasing their sanitation processes 
– including the back of the house 
and some spaces leading up to the 
dining hall. Additionally, greeters 
are no longer swiping M-Cards and 
students swipe their own. 
Symptoms of coronavirus include 
fever, cough and shortness of breath. 
To stop the spread of the virus, 
the Centers for Disease Control 
recommend people wash their 
hands often and avoid touching their 
eyes, nose and mouth.

24 hours with the Robert Anderson survivor 
protesters outside Schlissel’s house

10 
:00 a.m. By 7:00 p.m. on 
Nov. 5, Jonathan Vaughn, 
the Anderson survivor and former 
Michigan football player who has 
been leading the protest, will have 
been camping out in front of President 
Schlissel’s house for 28 days. 
On a normal day during the 
protest, Vaughn wakes up in his tent 
around 6:30 or 7:00 a.m. and heads to 
the Michigan Union, where he orders 
a coffee and breakfast sandwich from 
Sweetwaters Coffee & Tea. One of his 
favorite parts of the day is enjoying a 
morning cigar with his coffee. 
At 10:00 a.m., Ann Arbor is a brisk 
37 degrees, and Vaughn is getting out 
a pack of hand warmers from his tent 
to stuff in his pockets. Putting the 
hand warmers in his pants pockets, 
Vaughn said, targets a main artery 
and keeps his toes warm during the 
day. Spending anywhere between 14 
to 18 hours of the day outside in the 
elements, Vaughn said staying warm 
is crucial to his endurance. 
In terms of the camp, Vaughn said 
he has gotten used to sleeping outside 
but will have to prepare his tent better 
for the winter ahead. Currently, 

Vaughn said he relies on generators 
and heaters to keep him warm, but 
they do not last the entire night. 
What makes his days go by faster 
and what keeps his mind off the cold, 
Vaughn said, is being able to talk to 
his fellow campers and those passing 
by who stop to check in and offer 
their support.
2 
:00 p. m. At 2:00 p.m., the camp 
is humming along. Vaughn is 
playing some music from a bluetooth 
speaker, while Christian talks with 
passersby near their large sign. A few 
people sign the poster, but most who 
walk by either have already signed, 
or they ignore the protest and mutter 
quietly. 
“I walk past every morning, so I 
do know that it’s about the sexual 
assault, sexual allegation situation,” 
Engineering 
sophomore 
Collin 
McManus said. “I can see obviously 
it’s peaceful, these guys always have 
great energy. They’re making a 
statement for sure.” 
Christian shares that he is an 
artist, producing paintings for many 
notable celebrities and athletes, 
including head football coach Jim 
Harbaugh. Everyone is very excited 
for the campout scheduled for later 
in the evening. The mood overall 
is very cheerful. Christian dances, 

noting how he is grateful that he is 
still able to despite his prostate cancer 
diagnosis.
“I dance everywhere,” Christian 
said after hearing a catchy song. “See, 
‘cause the thing is, I was supposed to 
be dead two and half years ago. So it’s 
like, I dance every chance I get.”
9 
:00 p. m. By 9:00 p.m., the group 
of protesters grows to around 
30. Huddling together in a circle, 
each individual takes turns sharing 
why they came out tonight. Some 
are here in solidarity, and others 
are also survivors of sexual assault 
themselves. But everyone here has 
the same purpose: to enact change.
“No more hiding,” Christian 
said. “Those days are over. No more 
hanging my head in shame. Those 
days are over. No more denying what 
happened to us. Those days are over. 
Because why? Because I have a voice. 
I have a voice. I have a voice.”
The group’s energy can be felt 
from a block away, with chants of 
“I have a voice” and “Hail to the 
Victims” ringing across the street. 
Very few people walk through the 
group. In fact, most passersby cross 
the street before reaching the tents.
Soon after, a projector screen is 
created using a white blanket placed 
over the signature board, directly 

facing Schlissel’s house. A heartfelt 
video shows Christian and his son 
having a conversation about his 
diagnosis in 2016. Christian’s son 
then gifted his father a song titled 
“Superman,” which plays at the end 
of the video. 
The atmosphere is heavy, with 
many in the crowd tearing up, 
including Christian himself. Vaughn 
brings over a box of tissues for 
Christian, one of the many moments 
of sincere understanding and true 
friendship between the two.
11 
:00 
p. 
m. 
A 
couple 
of 
microphones, a laptop and a 
speaker is all it takes to set up the 
first “Hail to the Victims Karaoke 
Night.” Both the Anderson survivors 
and those walking by sing various 
songs, inviting the rest of the crowd 
to join in. Vaughn raps along to a 
Run-D.M.C. song which he says 
was “his freshman song” and one 
he remembers singing in the school 
cafeteria. 
Business senior Job Mayhue is 
part of the men’s track and field team 
at the University, as well as a member 
of Take Back the Night, a student-run 
campaign against sexual violence.
Mayhue told The Daily he heard 
about the Anderson survivors’ camp-
out through his work with Take 

Back the Night, but Friday night was 
his first time visiting. Mayhue has 
several conversations with Vaughn 
and Christian throughout the hour 
and told The Daily that witnessing 
the simultaneous vulnerability and 
strength of the survivors is incredibly 
inspiring.
“I think everyone should just take 
the time to really think about this,” 
Mayhue said. “It’s easy to see it and 
just go on with your life. But if we wait 
to care about problems until they are 
happening to us, that’s a really bad 
situation.”
9 
:00 a. m. A coalition of student 
organizations 
— 
Michigan 
Students Against Sexual Assault, 
Central Student Government and 
Roe v. Rape — begins a teach-in at 
9:00 a.m. by listing out their demands 
for the University. The demands are 
split into four categories: prevention 
of sexual assault; adequate response 
to 
sexual 
assault 
allegations; 
resources for survivors and victims; 
and healing the community. 
As the teach-in begins, tour groups 
are spotted diverting through the 
Law Quad, entering from State Street 
and exiting from the archway next 
to Tappan Avenue. Notably, parents 
and prospective students are heard 
asking about the protests as they 

notice the tents. 
Of the six or seven tour groups seen 
walking by, the majority of guides do 
not address the questions, sticking to 
the usual tour script. One appears to 
mention it in passing as two people, 
an older woman and a girl looking to 
be in her teens, break from the group 
and begin reading the signs set up. 
The demands are now posted 
beneath the signature board outside 
of the president’s house. The student 
organizations 
who 
created 
the 
demands encourage anyone with 
suggestions for the demands to reach 
out to them. 
A second tour guide is heard 
directly addressing the protest and 
the goals, but no one from the group 
breaks away. At the back of this 
group, an older man dismisses the 
protest as “overreacting” to a boy 
who is presumably his son.
With the streets abuzz with 
parents and students in anticipation 
for the football game, the survivors 
had not yet emerged from their tents 
at 10:00 a.m., bringing the day-in-the-
life coverage to a close.

Opinion
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

S

ince I started studying at 
the University of Michigan, 
I have become more and 
more familiar with Washtenaw 
County’s 
primarily 
rural 
character: its winding gravel 
roads, bucolic red farmhouses and 
wide-open spaces. Just beyond 
Ann Arbor’s city limits in almost 
every direction lies a spectacular 
expanse of greenery, mimicking 
the rural escapes of Northern 
Michigan.
Last Saturday, I had a few 
spare hours and decided to take 
a drive out into the countryside 
only a few minutes from Central 
Campus. Traveling down two-
lane country roads just outside 
of Ann Arbor always puts me 
at peace, and against a vivid 
backdrop of leaves ablaze with the 
flames of autumn, the scenes that 
whizzed by outside were striking. 
 
There was one point that 
afternoon, however, that brought 
me crashing back to reality. I was 
driving down a road in Salem 
Township; the sun was just 
starting to dip toward the horizon, 
and the leaves were tinged with 
brilliant streaks of crimson and 
orange when a rectangular for 
sale sign advertising new home 
sites caught my eye. This sign 
signaled that new houses would 
invade at any moment and topple 
the idyllic landscape — and I 
realized when I saw it that the 
scene was fleeting.
***
Salem Township is a small, 
rural community in northeastern 
Washtenaw 
County 
with 
a 

population of about 6,000 people. 
Salem is roughly 10 miles from 
downtown Ann Arbor and is 
characterized by its country-like 
atmosphere, farmland and open 
space. Together with its neighbor 
to the south, Superior Township, 
Salem serves as a narrow buffer 
between the built-up urbanization 
of Metro Detroit — including 
Wayne County communities like 
Canton and Plymouth — and the 
splendor of Ann Arbor we have 
come to love. 
For decades, even as far-flung 
locations in Metro Detroit have 
experienced dramatic waves of 
urban sprawl, Washtenaw County 
has largely retained its identity as 
a distinct community. Even just a 
half mile west of the border with 
Wayne County, Washtenaw has 
held on to its beautiful and scenic 
landscape. 
This, however, could all change 
as Washtenaw braces for a new 
wave of sprawl that, this time, 
might be powerful enough to 
encroach beyond the boundaries of 
Metro Detroit. Schostak Brothers 
and Company, a developer based 
in Livonia, has plans to develop 
hundreds 
of 
acres 
of 
rural 
countryside in Salem Township 
centered near Michigan Highway 
14’s interchange with Gotfredson 
Road. If these plans are put into 
action, this single project alone 
could lead to a 25% jump in 
Salem’s population.
Schostak’s plans for building 
a massive residential and retail 
project 
date 
back 
to 
2003, 
when the prominent Michigan 

developer first purchased this 
land. Since then, the project 
has gotten tangled up in legal 
battles over zoning as nearby 
residents push back against the 
development. 
(This 
multi-use 
plan has also been scrutinized 
over the origins of a questionable 
Michigan Economic Development 
Corporation grant to help the 
project get off the ground.)
More recently, the project — 
dubbed “Salem Springs” — has 
stalled as Schostak struggles to 
find a way to connect the land to 
the sewer system. The developer 
is currently fighting a court battle 
over running a sewer line south to 
the Ypsilanti Community Utilities 
Authority 
through 
Superior 
Township; Superior is (rightly) 
blocking 
the 
construction 
of 
this line through its agricultural 
district, as a sewer could set off 
a new wave of sprawl within its 
own community. 
***
Maybe the court will rule 
against this project, and maybe 
the land will be spared. Maybe 
I’ll be able to drive down the same 
two-lane country road next fall, 
and maybe I’ll find solace in the 
brilliant shades of autumn again. 
Sadly, I know the odds this 
would happen are decent at best. 
Development is sometimes just 
impossible to defeat. And even 
if somehow Schostak’s plans are 
derailed, it will only be so long 
until the next developer proposes 
to raze a slice of Washtenaw’s 
scenic wilderness.
These are depressing thoughts, 

and they should be. Urban sprawl 
is a truly destructive force that 
has 
destroyed 
communities 
across the country. Once it 
comes to Washtenaw County, it 
will be unstoppable if we don’t 
take a stand now. Our precious 
natural 
resources 
and 
open 
spaces are fragile and limited, 
and development will wipe them 
away. Forever.
Some might dismiss sprawl 
like Salem Springs as unrelated 
to the environmentally-conscious 
community of Ann Arbor that 
we have come to love, but this 
simply isn’t true. Regardless of 
how far our community may feel 
from Metro Detroit, the eastern 
border of Ann Arbor is less than 
seven miles from Wayne County. 
A mere seven miles is very little 
land for urban sprawl to cover, 
and once developers get it started, 
development could spread toward 
Ann Arbor like an uncontained 
wildfire.
This 
spells 
major 
trouble 
for Ann Arbor and its unique 
community identity, both as a 
cultural center and as the home 
of the University of Michigan. 
One day, commuters could drive 
between Detroit and Ann Arbor 
with no apparent change to the 
landscape — just subdivision after 
subdivision — to the point that our 
city could geographically exist as 
a large suburb of Metro Detroit. It 
might seem inconceivable today 
while there is so much greenery 
nearby to enjoy, but developers 
have been known to convert 
open fields into mazes of curving 

streets, cul-de-sacs and parking 
lots remarkably quickly.
More importantly, sprawl is 
one of the most hostile enemies 
of 
the 
environment. 
In 
the 
age of climate change, urban 
sprawl 
dramatically 
increases 
our 
community’s 
dependence 
on 
gas-powered 
vehicles 
for 
transportation. Massive trends 
of sprawl also eliminate large 
tracts 
of 
greenery, 
removing 
carbon-sequestering trees from 
the landscape and destroying 
plant and animal habitats. Finally, 
urban sprawl claims land that has 
previously been used for farming 
in the past. In Ann Arbor in 
particular, we are quite fortunate 
to be in such close proximity to so 
many successful farm operations 
that provide locally-sourced and 
organic produce. But these too 
could be lost to urban sprawl if we 
turn a blind eye to Washtenaw’s 
growing 
fight 
against 
these 
development pressures.
***
There is reason for hope. Ann 
Arbor and Washtenaw County are 
lucky to be home to a community 
that 
cares 
so 
deeply 
about 
protecting our green spaces. For 
nearly two decades, the city of Ann 
Arbor has operated its innovative 
Greenbelt Program, an effort that 
aims to protect natural resources, 
farmland and open space in eight 
surrounding townships, including 
Salem and Superior Townships. 
This 
program 
has 
already 
permanently protected more than 
6,100 acres of land, with new 
landowners applying to join the 

city’s greenbelt every year. 
In addition to the Greenbelt 
Program, 
which 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
prominent 
land 
preservation initiatives in the 
community, many other entities 
have committed to defending 
our green spaces. Washtenaw 
County leads a Natural Areas 
Preservation Program, and many 
other 
organizations 
like 
the 
Legacy Land Conservancy and 
Superior Greenway lead similar 
efforts. Moreover, a number of 
communities, Superior Township 
in particular, have implemented 
strict measures to protect their 
green space and agricultural 
districts.
In the end, it is perfectly 
appropriate for a community 
like Washtenaw County, with a 
thriving economic landscape, to 
be the site of some development. 
But it is crucial that development 
is 
both 
economically 
and 
environmentally 
responsible, 
as well as minimal. Enormous, 
disconnected 
projects 
like 
Salem Springs are irresponsible 
and will lead to an explosion in 
development and sprawl across 
our community. 
County 
officials, 
township 
governments and city leaders 
must work together immediately 
to form a comprehensive plan 
aimed at protecting Washtenaw’s 
invaluable natural spaces. It’s not 
too late. This is our community, 
and our green spaces, to defend.

Salem Springs threatens last stretch of green space 
between Detroit and Ann Arbor

I

n 2020, the first and most 
intense year of the COVID-
19 pandemic, daily life in our 
society underwent significant changes. 
These adaptations were part of what 
many believed to be a “new normal” 
that would persist as long as — if not 
longer than — the pandemic itself. 
Some developments have been widely 
considered 
positive. 
Unnecessary 
meetings were canceled or adapted 
into emails. Long commutes were 
often 
eliminated. 
Many 
families 
found themselves spending more time 
together. Despite the rapidly worsening 
state of public health, perhaps there 
were a few silver linings in this new 
normal.
Such was not the case for spectator 
sports and fans. With restrictions on 
large gatherings, live audiences were 
prevented from attending sporting 
events, and after long periods of 
complete shutdown, seasons were 
either canceled altogether or resumed 
in vacuum environments free of fans. 
Players across various sports noticed 
the difference in the atmosphere 
and the ways in which empty arenas 
impacted the games. Fans waxed 
poetic about missing the experience 
of attending live competitions and 
witnessing athletic history. These 
audience-free environments were a 
necessary alteration during the height 
of the pandemic, but all parties wished 
for the conditions which would allow 
sports and the broader community a 
return to normalcy.
With COVID-19 cases decreasing as 
a result of widespread immunization, 
spectators have started to trickle back 
into stadiums, and fan bases could not 
be happier. The sights and sounds of 
tens of thousands of raucous people 
reacting to every play could never be 

replaced by artificial crowd noise, 
and being part of a team’s home-field 
advantage is a magical feeling for 
fans of all ages. The return of fans has 
increased both the quality and stakes 
of each game played. The NFL, for one, 
has repeatedly called 2021 its “biggest 
season ever,” as the return of fans 
across the league and the addition of 
a 17th game for each team combine to 
ceremoniously usher in the future of 
the sport.
Nowhere has this comeback borne 
out more evidently than at Michigan 
Stadium, 
where 
spectators 
have 
enthusiastically returned after a 2020 
season that left many fans feeling 
as empty as the bleachers at the Big 
House. As the largest stadium in North 
America and the third-largest in the 
world, the complete absence of fans 
could not be more unnatural. In normal 
times, those in attendance at Michigan 
football games are reminded by 
announcer Carl Grapentine that they 
are part of the “largest crowd watching 
a football game anywhere in America 
today,” a fact which carries special 
weight after a year in which crowds 
were robbed of the electric atmosphere 
of Michigan football. U-M fans 
certainly appear refreshed upon their 
return, with their spirited game day 
traditions, such as the crowd’s inspired 
singing of The Killers’ “Mr. Brightside,” 
garnering national attention.
For those who already had the chance 
to be part of college fandom before 
the pandemic struck, the removal of 
fans from sporting events made for 
yet another tough blow. Taking in a 
game at the Big House, Crisler Center, 
Yost Ice Arena or anywhere else on 
campus is a one-of-a-kind experience 
and practically a rite of passage for U-M 
students. With boisterous collective 

chants, seas of maize and blue apparel 
and the exceptional performances of 
U-M student-athletes, the environment 
is unparalleled. After a year of watching 
from our couches as U-M teams achieve 
greatness, students and fans have found 
an even greater appreciation for simply 
being present.
Athletes often explain their love 
for team-oriented sport through an 
appreciation for being part of something 
greater than themselves. The same can 
be said for fans, who dedicate their time, 
resources and energy to the teams they 
adore. Their cheers, whether stemming 
from euphoria or exasperation, are 
what make spectator sporting events 
the popular rituals they are. Research 
has shown that the presence and 
energy of a live audience often affect 
the performance of athletes and may 
exert notable influence on the outcome 
of a game. Home court advantage exists 
and can certainly prove powerful. 
After a year in which people felt 
more socially isolated than ever before, 
the enthusiasm for live sports comes 
as no surprise. Despite the lingering 
of COVID-19, many of those with a 
love for their teams and competition 
simply cannot remain on the sidelines 
any longer. It once seemed improbable 
for crowds to come back to arenas this 
year, or perhaps for even longer. Now, 
scientific developments and necessary 
precautions 
have 
assured 
that 
in-person sports attendance is back and 
likely here to stay, and it is beautiful to 
see athletes and fans coming together 
once again. For those able to attend who 
haven’t gotten in on the action, there’s 
no better time to get in the game and be 
a part of something bigger than oneself.

U

pon entering college, 
I 
expected 
my 
financial situation to fit 
that of the “broke college student” 
I had heard was the norm. The 
absurdly high cost of tuition at 
colleges and universities in the 
United States places a heavy 
financial burden on families, with 
69% of college students in the class 
of 2019 taking out student loans 
and graduating with a debt of 
$29,000 on average. This obstacle 
within the college experience 
has given the average American 
college student the stereotype of 
being “broke.”
I soon came to see that this 
stereotype did not fit the average 
University of Michigan student, 
as the median family income 
on the University’s campus is 
$154,000. This stands significantly 
higher than the national median 
household income of $68,703. 
Staple parts of life for many 
U-M students — at times, myself 
included 
— 
are 
allowances, 
Canada Goose jackets and even 
a parent’s credit card on hand. 
Wealth inequality is one of the 
most 
pressing 
issues 
facing 
America. On a smaller scale at the 
University, however, I have noticed 
this inequality manifesting itself 
largely in the food scene. 
Last year as a freshman living 
in the dorms and this year as a 
sophomore living in Greek life 
housing, I have paid for meal plans. 
While the meal plan I am on now 
does not offer dinner on Saturdays 
or breakfast on Sundays, I often 
find myself spending money on 
food even on days when my meal 
plan does offer food. 
In best college town rankings, 
Ann Arbor is almost always in 
the top three, offering amazing 
food options for takeout and dine-
in experiences. Therefore, food 
in Ann Arbor is at the center of 
social life for many U-M students. 
Especially during the pandemic 
with social events being limited, 
getting food with friends or 
going out to eat are some of the 

easiest options for socializing and 
changing up your daily routine. 
Because the average median 
income at the University is so 
high, many do not understand 
that centering socializing around 
spending money on food puts 
students that are more financially 
conscious 
in 
uncomfortable 
situations, 
having 
to 
choose 
between spending time with 
friends or saving money. 
Further, when students choose 
to spend money on food while 
having meal plans purchased, this 
increases food waste because meal 
plans produce enough food for 
everyone with a plan to be served. 
Nine-hundred twenty-five million 
people in the world are considered 
starving while 1.3 billion tons 
of food are wasted annually — 
this is enough food to feed three 
billion people. By increasing food 
waste, students are exacerbating 
inequality 
in 
an 
extremely 
unnecessary way. 
University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel has stated that the 
University is seeking to “welcome 
students from all communities 
and backgrounds who have the 
talent and desire to be Michigan 
Wolverines.” 
However, 
for 
the University to become a 
truly welcoming campus to 
students from all socioeconomic 
backgrounds, the culture around 

spending 
money 
among 
the 
students themselves must become 
more considerate and aware of the 
financial burdens others may be 
facing. 
Student spending in the city of 
Ann Arbor, not including groceries 
and housing, is estimated to be at 
around $94.9 million annually. 
Food is at the center of Ann Arbor’s 
economic success and students 
are an integral source of income 
for many Ann Arbor businesses. 
Therefore, students who can afford 
to spend money on food and enjoy 
doing so should continue giving 
Ann Arbor restaurants business. 
However, students must put 
more thought into deciding to 
eat out. Not only is there the 
larger issue of food waste, but by 
constantly centering socializing 
around spending money on food, 
students are creating an exclusive 
community 
that 
perpetuates 
socioeconomic divisions within 
the student body. While it may feel 
at times that everyone can afford to 
spend money on food, the typical 
college student faces extreme 
financial burdens from the high 
cost of tuition. When social life is 
centered around spending money, 
our community will never be 
welcoming to everyone.

D

ear President Schlissel,
If you’re reading this 
message, walk outside 
your door and talk to Jonathan 
Vaughn. 
In 
case, 
President 
Schlissel, you don’t know who 
that is, you may want to check 
out the student, local, statewide 
and national press coverage that 
his courageous statement has 
attracted. He is one of more than 
2,000 students and athletes who 
survived the abuse of Dr. Robert 
Anderson, and he would like to 
talk to you. Now that you must 
know who Jonathan Vaughn is, 
walk outside your door and speak 
to him. 
If you’re still reading at this 
point, President Schlissel, and 
not outside talking to Jonathan 
Vaughn, then I have to imagine 
there must be some problem 
preventing you from talking 
to him. Let’s brainstorm some 
solutions.
Maybe you’ve been looking for 
Jon all over campus but can’t find 
him to speak with him! Finding 
your 
way 
around 
campus, 
especially with changing bus 
routes, can always be tricky. 
Thankfully, he’s right outside 
your house! If you’re still having 
trouble finding him, send me an 
email about directions, and I’d 
be happy to walk you the 10 steps 
out your door to the sidewalk. 
If 
you’re 
still 
reading, 
President 
Schlissel, 
then 
it must not be a problem of 
directions. Maybe you’re staying 
inside because you’re worried 
about catching COVID-19? A 
reasonable fear, given that we are 
living in an ongoing pandemic. 
If you are staying inside because 
you’re concerned about catching 
COVID-19, don’t you think it’s 
a little hypocritical that you 
aren’t giving faculty the same 
opportunity? You provided a 
ringing endorsement of “Work 
Connections” in the face of 

faculty members telling you the 
current process is a failed system. 
While I can’t cure hypocrisy, I can 
say that it does breed discontent. 
Studies have shown outdoor, 
masked and vaccinated meetings 
have incredibly low chances of 
COVID-19 transmission. Put on a 
mask, walk outside your door and 
talk to Jon.
If you’ve gotten this far, 
President Schlissel, then it must 
not be directions or a COVID-
19 worry that’s stopping you. 
Perhaps you’ve lost your voice 
and are worried Jon won’t be able 
to hear you if you go outside to 
speak with him. I know my voice 
would undoubtedly be hoarse if I 
spent even half the time making 
empty promises of accountability 
and transparency as you do. To 
your credit, it is astounding you 
found the words to keep your 
job scandal, after scandal, after 
scandal, after scandal, after 
scandal; we’ve all been waiting 
for years for the other shoe to 
drop. If your voice is sore from 
all of the platitudes, as someone 
who works with singers as part of 
my degree in the School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance, I suggest warm 
water with honey and lemon, a 
humidifier for your bedroom and 
vocal rest. Drink some tea, walk 
outside your door and talk to Jon.
If 
you’ve 
made 
it 
here, 
President Schlissel, then it must 
not be directions, COVID-19 or 
a sore voice that’s preventing 
you from doing, quite literally, 
the bare minimum for these 
survivors. Perhaps your schedule 
is 
too 
busy; 
maybe 
you’ve 
penciled in too much time to 
think about how you’re going 
to spend your early removal 
package! If that’s how much a 
failed presidency costs, I can’t 
even imagine how much we’ll 
have to spend on a successful one. 
But look, I get it, especially at this 
point in the year, things just pile 

up. I’d suggest budgeting time a 
little differently; why don’t you 
take some of the time you spend 
ignoring the Faculty Senate and 
use it to talk to Jon? Make some 
free time, walk outside your door 
and speak to Jon.
If 
you’ve 
read 
this 
far, 
President Schlissel, I can’t say it 
is looking good for you. I would 
like to think I’m an intelligent 
guy, but truthfully, I’m running 
out of solutions for you. Suppose 
it’s not about directions, COVID-
19, losing your voice or a packed 
schedule. In that case, the only 
remaining problem I can think of 
is that you’re a selfish, cowardly 
embarrassment to the University 
of Michigan. We’re supposed 
to be the “Leaders and Best” 
around here, remember? If you 
can’t muster up the courage to 
go outside your house and talk to 
someone who is far braver than 
you, then you don’t deserve to 
be the head of this University. 
Being the “Leaders and Best” is 
not a passive description of who 
we are, but a higher calling we 
are charged to pursue in all we 
do; if we don’t have that in the 
highest office, what are we as an 
institution? If you can’t do this 
one small act that would make a 
large impact in the lives of these 
survivors, and survivors of other 
scandals under your tenure, then 
I suggest you close this article, 
gather your personal belongings 
and resign immediately instead 
of in June 2023 as planned. Make 
sure you sneak out the backdoor 
so you don’t risk bumping into a 
real “Leader and Best.” 
If you feel, President Schlissel, 
that none of these possible 
problems address your neglect 
of Jonathan Vaughn, feel free to 
reach out. I’m sure we can think 
of something.

Dear President Schlissel, 
talk to Jon.

From The Daily: Schlissel is 
gone, now what?
W

hen the Regents of 
the University of 
Michigan 
decided 
to terminate former University 
President Mark Schlissel, they 
released 118 pages of Schlissel’s 
communications along with 
their announcement. These 
documents, 
containing 
emails, text messages and 
images, while important in 
the name of transparency, 
were promptly snapped up by 
a ravenous student body. One 
reddit 
comment 
remarked 
that “Never had this many 
undergraduates been so keen to 
do primary source research on 
a Saturday night.” The emails 
were memefied immediately, 
with merchandise coming to 
the market within the week, 
making fun of our lonely 
president m. This transparency 
is refreshing and Schlissel’s 
indiscretions 
were 
serious, 
but one naturally wonders, 
especially 
considering 
the 
predictable student reaction, 
whether this dump of salacious 
documents is anything other 
than an attempt to shield 
the Board of Regents — not 
necessarily the University as 
an institution — from blame 
and embarrassment.
It was no secret that Schlissel 
was not particularly popular 
on 
campus; 
discussions 
regarding 
Schlissel 
were 
frequently 
filled 
with 
frustration or disappointment. 
These grievances have led 
students to often question his 
decisions. However, many of 
the trademark bad decisions 
made 
by 
Schlissel 
were 
directed, or at least directly 
influenced, by the board. 
Take 
the 
unpopular 
decision to prematurely bring 
students back to campus for 
the fall 2020 semester — prior 
to the development of COVID-
19 vaccines. This was not a 
unilateral decision by Schlissel 
and his administration but was 
a subject of major frustration 
for students who felt they had 
no voice in this decision. One 
board 
member, 
University 
Regent Ron Weiser (R), who 
has a financial stake in off-
campus housing, even donated 
$30 million to the University 
days before its announcement 
to reopen. No one can quantify 
the impact of the regents, 
especially those with vested 
interests, on these decisions 
conclusively, 
but 
we 
must 
reflect on their influence.
While 
Schlissel’s 
actions 
were both damaging to the 
University’s reputation and 
an abuse of the power he 
held over U-M employees, 
numerous faculty accused of 
sexual assault and harassment 
were allowed a far more 
graceful exit. 
When 
former 
American 
Culture 
lecturer 
Bruce 
Conforth 
was 
reported 
to 
University 
officials 
for 
attempting 
to 
engage 
in 
sexual 
relationships 
with 
three 
students 
in 
2008, 
he was allowed to retire 

otherwise unpunished in 2017 
— inarguably a much more 
private departure than that of 
Schlissel. 
Former 
Music, 
Theatre 
& 
Dance 
professor 
David 
Daniels was fired by the 
board 
for 
allegations 
of 
sexual misconduct in March 
of 2020. Not only did the 
board not include a similarly 
large disclosure report, they 
began the process of formally 
firing Daniels over a year 
earlier, in July of 2019, based 
on allegations made public 
in August of 2018. Schlissel 
was 
reported, 
investigated 
and terminated in under two 
months.
In the well-known case 
of 
former 
Provost 
Martin 
Philbert, the board released 
an 88-page report based on 
an 
investigation 
into 
his 
sexual misconduct. However, 
releasing 
118 
pages 
of 
memeable emails does not have 
the same effect that releasing 
a dense WilmerHale report 
does. Hundreds of jokes were 
not inspired by this in-depth 
report, only a fraction of which 
consists of Philbert’s actual 
communications. 
Secondary 
sources like this report tend 
to obscure the actual nature of 
the relevant content, as actual 
words 
inherently 
convey 
more than descriptions. The 
Regents’ decision to release 
a mass of personal messages 
deviates from its customary 
form of transparency about 
its activities, which typically 
consists of formal reports like 
the one regarding Philbert. 
In their official release, the 
board said they were releasing 
Schlissel’s 
communications 
“In the interest of full public 
disclosure.” Was this kind 
of visibility not necessary in 
those previous cases? Was the 
speed with which the board 
investigated 
and 
removed 
Schlissel not necessary before? 
This is not to criticize 
the Board’s decision to be 
transparent. If the board is 
going to adequately combat 
the 
ongoing 
and 
historic 
issues of sexual assault and 
harassment in the University, 
as they should, a consistent 
approach is necessary. This is 
to say that releasing important 
documents related to similar 
allegations should be the norm 
— not exclusive to figures with 
a negative public image like 
Schlissel. 
But apart from Schlissel’s 
strained 
relationship 
with 
students and faculty, it is 
worth noting that he fell out 
with the Board of Regents 
in the past year too. In light 
of the severity with which 
Schlissel’s case was treated 
in 
comparison 
to 
other 
aforementioned cases, it is 
clear that the board chose to 
use Schlissel’s actions as a 
means to (rightfully) remove 
an adversary of theirs. While 
these emails were insightful 
and 
undeniably 
humorous, 
this is a politicization of the 

process of dealing with sexual 
misconduct that will serve to 
taint 
future 
investigations 
with the stench of bias. Only a 
consistent protocol will ensure 
that this does not occur.
The 
board 
and 
administration must release a 
comprehensive plan of action 
for any future sexual assault 
or misconduct reports against 
professors, 
administration 
officials or any employed 
University official. Such a 
comprehensive 
plan 
will 
ensure that every case is 
treated seriously and with 
consistency to ensure that 
transgressions 
are 
treated 
with 
the 
seriousness 
and 
transparency they deserve. 
A system where allegations 
of misconduct are treated on 
a case-by-case basis allows 
for 
certain 
individuals, 
like Conforth, Daniels and 
Philbert to get away with their 
behavior for years. Sexual 
misconduct can occur at any 
level of the University. Only 
taking strong, public action 
against the most recognizable 
figures fails to address the 
broader issue. 
While firing Schlissel is a 
step in the right direction, the 
Board of Regent’s choice of an 
interim replacement, President 
Emerita Mary Sue Coleman, 
is 
not 
untainted 
herself. 
Coleman 
was 
reportedly 
aware of allegations against 
Martin Philbert during her 
tenure as president. Despite 
the allegations and Coleman’s 
knowledge, 
Philbert 
was 
allowed to continue serving 
as Dean of the School of 
Public Health for the rest of 
Coleman’s term and nearly six 
years afterward.
If Coleman’s appointment 
was meant by the board as 
a return to normalcy, to the 
“scandal free” era before 
Schlissel, it just shows how 
deeply tolerance of sexual 
misconduct is ingrained in the 
University’s administration. 
The 
flood 
of 
sexual 
assault 
and 
harassment 
allegations against faculty 
and administrators during 
Schlissel’s term was by no 
means unique. The issues of 
sexual 
misconduct 
within 
this university have been tied 
to Mark Schlissel; losing him 
means losing a figurehead to 
rally against and replacing 
him with a less controversial 
former president who people 
remember fondly. Once the 
jokes about these emails die 
down, we will still be left 
with an administration that 
turns a blind eye to sexual 
misconduct, but this time one 
that commands less scrutiny 
from the public. This cannot 
become the case. We have 
to 
remain 
vigilant 
about 
this issue. To avoid further 
negligence and complaisance, 
we must hold the board 
accountable for consistent 
and fair actions when faced 
with such situations.

Arts
6 — Graduation Edition 2022

When we think of what defines 
good art, nationality and language 
are generally not the first factors that 
come to mind. Yet, in reality, the cel-
ebration of the arts is often heavily 
influenced by outdated ideas dictat-
ing what stories are deserving of rec-
ognition. 
The British-Japanese pop singer 
Rina Sawayama stands as one of the 
clearest examples of this phenom-
enon. When BRITs and the Mercury 
prize were released back in July, the 
30-year-old 
musician’s 
critically–
acclaimed album, SAWAYAMA, was 
noticeably missing from the lineup. 
Sawayama sat down with Vice follow-
ing the news, describing her exclu-
sion from nominations, and even the 
possibility to enter for consideration, 
as “othering.” Despite having lived 
in London for 25 years, Sawayama 
was not considered “British enough” 
according to stringent award guide-
lines, ones that she labeled as “border 
control.” 
Sawayama was born in Niigata, 
Japan, where she lived for five years 
before moving with her family to Lon-
don. She currently holds an indef-
inite-leave-to-remain 
visa, 
which 
grants Sawayama stay in the U.K. 
for an indefinite period of time and 
allows her to study and seek employ-
ment. Most of Sawayama’s family still 
lives in Japan, one of the few coun-
tries that prohibits dual-citizenship. 
She explains that “getting rid of my 
Japanese passport genuinely feels like 
I’m severing ties with them.” The sit-
uation shines light on a flawed defini-
tion of Britishness and the persistent 
view that non-European voices are 
unwelcome in British culture. 
But it’s not just a British issue; the 
Grammys are notorious for exclud-
ing Latin and other foreign language 

albums from their Album of the Year 
nominations. An album in a language 
other than English has never won 
Album of the Year, and for 2021 alone, 

there are only two nominations for 
Latin artists outside of the Latin cate-
gories. It’s yet another explicit exam-
ple of the music industry’s tendency 
to pigeonhole foreign talents. 
The recently released film “Minari” 
(2020), which follows the story of a 
Korean-American family living in 
rural Arkansas, faces a similar barri-
er. Although “Minari” was directed by 
American filmmaker Lee Isaac Chung 
and produced by American compa-
nies A24 and Plan B, the film was cat-
egorized as a foreign language film in 
the Golden Globes by the Hollywood 
Foreign Press Association. The HFPA 
guidelines stipulate that a film’s dia-
logue must be at least 50% English to 
be considered for Best Picture nomi-

nations. “Minari,” which features 
both Korean and English dialogue, as 
well as Korean and Korean-American 
talents, apparently didn’t make the 

cut. 
This exclusion comes on the tails of 
two similar cases at last year’s Gold-
en Globes. The Oscar-winning film 
“Parasite” (2019), which was entirely 
in Korean, and “The Farewell” (2019), 
a film with both English and Chinese 
dialogue, were also ineligible for Best 
Picture nominations despite receiv-
ing overwhelmingly positive reviews 
from critics. Lulu Wang, director of 
“The Farewell,” tweeted in response 
to this year’s Golden Globe nomina-
tions, “I have not seen a more Ameri-
can film than #Minari this year. It’s 
a story about an immigrant family, 
IN America, pursuing the American 
dream. We really need to change 
these antiquated rules that character-

ize American as only English-speak-
ing.” So often in American pop culture 
immigrant stories, especially those of 
people of color, are labeled as outsid-

er experiences despite their central 
importance to the American identity. 
So, is the only requirement for artistic 
recognition to speak English? 
As evident from past Best Picture 
nominations at the Globes, it’s not 
that simple. The 2009 film “Inglouri-
ous Basterds,” which prominently fea-
tures dialogue in German, French and 
Italian, was nominated in the Best 
Drama category despite large portions 
of its story transpiring in a language 
other than English. Many of its stars, 
including Christoph Waltz, Mélanie 
Laurent and Diane Kruger, are not 
American, calling into question why 
“Inglourious Basterds” and “Minari” 
have faced such different treatment 
despite their many commonalities. 

The problem that remains is that 
works in the Foreign Language cat-
egory do not receive nearly as much 
attention as those in the Best Drama 
or Musical/Comedy categories. The 
Golden Globes in particular nominate 
Best Actors and Actresses exclusively 
from these two groups, nominations 
which are not afforded to actors in 
foreign language films. They’re treat-
ed as an afterthought — never truly 
equivalent to their “domestic” coun-
terparts. It’s disheartening, to say the 
least. 
The experiences of Sawayama and 
“Minari” point to an overarching 
issue with xenophobic microaggres-
sions in Western pop culture. When 
the recognition of art is overshadowed 
by arbitrary percentages and passport 
statuses, it is abundantly clear that 
English-speaking cultures are still 
unwilling to view foreign works as 
equal. These works are often placed 
inside the box of their “foreignness” 
and treated as some kind of novelty, a 
completely separate entity from main-
stream American or British art. 
Even when music or films are pop-
ular among mainstream audiences, 
accolades like the Mercury prize and 
Golden Globes continue to either sub-
jugate this art or bar it from consider-
ation altogether. An unwillingness to 
change award qualifications displays 
an unwillingness to acknowledge that 
“British” or “American” identities 
today are not what they were in the 
past. 
Beneath this whole mess, what 
is perhaps most ironic is that both 
SAWAYAMA and “Minari” explore 
the trials of finding acceptance in 
Western culture and learning what it 
means to belong under the so-called 
Western 
identity. 
The 
continued 
exclusion of cultural “others” from 
prestigious award show recognition 
further solidifies how artistic inclu-
sion still has an incredibly far way to 
come. 

Stacey’s Mom has got it goin’ on — or 
at least, the animated moms of Pixar do. 
Since the 1995 premiere of “Toy Story,” 
the world’s first animated film made using 
computer technology, Pixar has become 
a household name. The studio is best 
known for its animated children’s films, 
from “Finding Nemo” to their most recent 
release, “Luca.” The name Pixar has long 
been synonymous with childhood — and 
now?
Pixar’s “The Incredibles”: Children 
recall the slapstick humor of Mr. Incred-
ible; parents fondly note the hidden, wry 
comedy that made the film a multi-gener-
ational hit. For others, it’s the firm, round 
backside of Mrs. Incredible’s peachy-keen 
cheeks; the tight elastic of a super-suit that 
clings like saran-wrap around her wide, 
womanly hips; the perkiness of a bum, the 
audacity of an ass, the perfection of a pear 
figure — aged by 40 years like a bottle of 
something fine. That’s right, Mrs. Incred-
ible is a MILF. Sorry, not sorry. 
Shocking, I know. Some readers may 
even be turning away in thinly veiled dis-
gust. How dare we sour the sanctity of a 
Pixar film with softcore erotica written in 
fervent devotion to Mrs. Incredible’s pop-
pin’ figure? We dare in the spirit of jour-
nalistic integrity, a devotion to seeking the 
truth. Because we aren’t the first to call 
Mrs. Incredible a MILF — that dubious 
glory belongs to the Internet and the horny 
little shits who live there. 
The MILFs: Who, What, Where
But first, what exactly is a MILF? As 
Urban Dictionary describes it, a MILF 
is a “Mom I’d Like to Fuck, or Mature I’d 
Like to Fuck.” MILFs usually apply to “hot 
moms,” but the term is liberally applied to 
any woman above the age of thirty. The 
MILF obsession is no niche Internet kink 
found in the recesses of Reddit but an ever-
growing phenomenon found across adult 
films, platforms like Instagram and even 
dating apps. According to a 2016 survey by 
the adult website GameLink.com, “inter-
est in MILF porn has risen 83%” between 
2012 and 2016. This trend has continued to 
grow in prevalence since.
Many consider the 1999 cult classic 
film “American Pie” to have launched the 
modern MILF obsession. The raunchy 
comedy follows a group of teenage boys 
competing to lose their virginity by their 

high school prom. In the film, actress Jen-
nifer Coolidge (“White Lotus”) has sex 
with her son’s friend — the true MILF 
fantasy. However, it is important to offer 
credit where credit is due to 1967 classic 
“The Graduate,” where actor Dustin Hoff-
man (“Rain Man”) is seduced by a beauti-
ful, neglected housewife: Mrs. Robinson 
(Anne Bancroft, “The Miracle Worker”). 
In 2003, Fountains of Wayne released 
their iconic hit “Stacy’s Mom,” a serenade 
to Stacy’s (supposedly) hot mom. As adult 
film star Tanya Tate remarked in a 2014 
interview with Thrillist, “there are plenty 
of guys out there who really had crushes on 
their Mom’s friends (as teenagers).”
In fact, the target age group for MILF 
content on adult websites is between the 
ages of 18 and 25; this age range lands neat-
ly between the naivety of adolescence and 
the “wisdom” of adulthood. It also corre-
lates with the widely accepted peak period 
of horniness.
The classic MILF lover is a not-yet man 
who washes his sheets every three months 
(optimistically), shotguns Natty Lights and 
advertises “MILFs only, seriously” on his 
dating profile. He believes women his age 
are “crazy,” “clingy” and far too sexually 
inexperienced to possibly please him. He 
longs for an older woman who promises 
a brief, scalding affair of “no crap,” who 
will usher him into manhood through the 
power of her perky, never sagging triple-
Ds and lust for a barely-pubescent, skinny, 
frat pledge’s medium-firm abs. It is this 
dazzling specimen of raw masculinity that 
drives the MILF-ication of Pixar moms. 
The Evolution of the Pixar MILF and 
Evolving Beauty Standards
Pixar MILFs walk a fine line between 
the celebration of motherhood and pander-
ing to societal beauty trends. On one hand, 
moms can be and are hot. Our critique of 
MILF culture is in no way a rejection of 
hot moms. Moms deserve to embrace their 
femininity and womanhood, to embrace 
themselves, to be a woman as well as a 
mom. On the other hand, in consideration 
of evolving beauty trends over the last 
twenty years, there is an undeniable par-
allel between the developing animation of 
Pixar moms to emphasize curves and con-
temporary beauty standards.
While the definition of the ideal body 
changes, women will always be subject to 
damaging and often unachievable beauty 
standards regardless of the form they take. 
The idea of the “perfect” ass, or, if you’ll 
allow me, “booty standards” has varied 
wildly, reaching all ends of the spectrum 

in the last three decades. Pixar, of course, 
animates the women who appear in its 
films to comply with such booty stan-
dards, sculpting and reinforcing the image 
to which real women and girls compare 
themselves. 
In the ’90s, as Bustle puts it, “the ideal 
(…) butt was super tiny and kind of flat.” 
The original Toy Story hit theaters in 1995 
and, accordingly, Andy’s mom, the only 
human woman who appears in the film, 
has an unremarkable, flat behind (and zero 
impact whatsoever on the plot or any char-
acter development). Andy’s mom is also 
known as Ms. Davis (little-known fact, 
courtesy of Pixar Wiki) and is a secondary 
or even tertiary character, background to 
Andy, who is background to the real stars 
of the film: the toys, who compete for 
Andy’s affection. 
As the flat ass went out of style and the 
Kardashian-style (read: humongous, typi-
cally cellulite-free and expensive) booty 
began to take its place in pop culture, 
Pixar’s animation choices reflected the 
change onscreen. In 2004, Pixar unveiled 
the Incredibles and thus the MILF of all 
MILFs (and, with her, the dump truck ass 
of all animated dump truck asses): Mrs. 
Incredible, AKA Elastigirl. The matriarch 
of the Incredible family is the most iconic 
superhero mom of all time (and unques-
tionably hot). In the first movie of the 
franchise, she’s got a more than ample size 
booty and a stick-thin waist, giving her 
curves so dramatic that she’d fall over if 
she were real. 
Jump to 2014, when “Big Hero 6” 
blessed us with sexy-ass MILF Aunt Cass 
who is also, to put it mildly, well-endowed 
in the behind area. Then, in 2017, “Coco,” 
a musical tale of a boy with a dream to 
realize his stardom and the history of his 
family, hit the big screen. The boy, Miguel, 
finds himself in the land of the dead and 
among many of his ancestors, including 
Mama Imelda, his great-great-grand-
mother. Despite Imelda being not techni-
cally human but an adorned skeleton (thus 
lacking any flesh or muscle), the animators 
make use of her bones to give a suggestion 
of her figure. They suggest, of course, an 
enormous ass. Imelda wears a royal purple 
dress that flows out at her hips and behind, 
suggesting the big booty underneath that 
once was. 

Mama Imelda’s imagined backside was 
nothing in comparison to that of Mrs. 
Incredible in the second installment of 
the Incredibles franchise. In “Incredibles 
2,” released in 2018, Mrs. Incredible’s ass 

reached new heights, or, more accurately, 
new voluptuous extremes. As we’ve stum-
bled through the 2010s into the 2020s, 
the size of the ideal booty has grown dra-
matically alongside our enormous exis-
tential anxiety. Thus, Mrs. Incredible’s 
perfectly smooth and gigantic ass (which 
was already highlighted by her new suit) 
needed to be bigger, too. 
Fan Art of Pixar MILFS and non-
MILFS
When Pixar does fail to animate a 
woman character in compliance with 
exaggerated beauty standards, “fans” take 
matters into their own hands and hyper-
sexualize the characters themselves. The 
result? Fan art. In this case, crude illustra-
tions and photoshopped images of MILFs 
and non-MILF characters alike. If she’s 
not a MILF, she becomes one. If she is, the 
features that make her so become even 
more exaggerated. A quick Google search 
for images of Ratatouille’s Colette yields a 
drawn resemblance of the character, but 
with a dramatically contoured face, pouty 
lips and a big, bulging, smooth ass.
The aunt from “Big Hero Six” is another 
serious offender: Aunt Cass is regularly 
photoshopped in illustrations to have 
Hooters-level pornographic cleavage. Her 
polite, crew-cut neckline swapped for a 
scoop-neck design barely able to contain 
her overflowing breasts. The image prac-
tically drips with the drool of horny men 
who salivate every time a woman bends 
over. 
It is in the hyper-sexualization of Pixar 
moms in fan art that MILF culture truly 
becomes apparent. Where Pixar may be 
guilty of pandering to popular beauty stan-
dards — elevating moms who are often 
absent from and even rejected by fashion 
and beauty trends to a level of femininity 
offered only to the young (and perky) — fan 
art reveals the sheer infatuation fans have 
with fucking moms. 
Although these female characters have 
enough ass for everyone, the actual number 
of Pixar mom characters is limited. This 
only communicates that more important 
than the personhood of a mom is her body, 
because her primary value will always be 
as a sexual object; her primary purpose to, 
as an asshole once yelled at me at a repro-
ductive rights protest from his truck as he 
drove by, “go make a baby.” Women get to 
be either caring mothers or bad bitches; 
then they’re forced into two-dimension-
ality. These characters exist to serve men 
— be it by birthing them and caring for 
them directly, or by offering themselves as 

sexual objects. In this light, Pixar’s work 
doesn’t empower moms but rather harms 
women and girls because it doesn’t glorify 
moms as they truly are. Instead, it suggests 
that they can only achieve glory or even 
be worth anything if they embody these 
impossible standards.
Why MILFs?
This discussion leaves us with one final 
question: Why MILFs? There are sev-
eral arguments to consider. The Oedipus 
complex suggests that children form an 
unconscious sexual desire for parents of 
the opposite sex and a sense of competition 
with the parent of the same sex. In this 
sense, young men begin to idolize older 
women as sexual partners due to lingering 
envy and desire for their own mothers. In 
other words, “mommy issues.”
Absent mothers can push men to seek 
maternal-sexual affection to replace or 
make up for that neglect; overbearing 
or extremely affectionate mothers can 
prompt men to project their relationships 
with their mothers onto other women in 
their life. For some men, it’s a question of 
helplessness. Unable to cook, clean, dress 
or navigate the wild, these young pups 
find themselves defenseless and unwilling 
to adapt to the newfound independence 
of adulthood. Traditional gender roles 
emphasize women as caregivers — perhaps 
MILFs developed through a fetishization 
of the traditional housewife role as women 
become increasingly independent.
Perhaps the most common drive, how-
ever, is the perception of older women as 
sexually experienced, mature and taboo. 
In this relationship, the young man offers 
nothing but their hot-stud body. The MILF 
would cater to their pleasure while simul-
taneously acting as a caregiver: maternal 
and comforting for the sexually inexperi-
enced. MILF culture is obsessed with what 
women can offer to men. There is no sense 
of a woman’s sexual pleasure — if she does 
benefit, it is through the ability to “catch” 
a young man. Notice how the condemna-
tion of “cougar” and the fetishization of 
“MILF” are simultaneously incongruent, 
yet strikingly similar.
Even in the supposed renaissance of the 
older woman, mothers are still constrained 
to the desire of men, eternal caregivers. 
When’s the last time a man between 18–25 
years of age found the clit? Yeah, that’s 
what I thought.
As perhaps the MILF-man (a “mommy 
boy”) would put it best: “Mommy? Sorry. 
Mommy? Sorry. Mommy?” — Mommy, not 
sorry.

Reading has always been a solitary 
activity for me. When I checked out 
books at the public library as a child, I 
knew that those books were mine alone 
for the next two weeks. I read for hours 
while curled up on the couch, oblivious to 
everything except the words on the page. 
When my mother called me for dinner, I 
scrambled to reach a good stopping point 
in my book before joining my family.
As a child, I’d never thought of books 
as a way to build friendships or commu-
nity. But Little Free Libraries is looking 
to change that.
Little Free Libraries is a nonprofit 
committed to inspiring a love for books 
and community. The movement focuses 
on filling book deserts — areas with few 
accessible public libraries — with small 

book-sharing boxes, known as Little 
Libraries. The concept is simple: Take 
a book, leave a book in return. Since its 
creation in 2009, the Little Free Library 
movement has built over 100,000 librar-
ies around the world to promote literacy 
and reading.
“As a young girl, going to the library 
and checking out books really changed 
my life and made me a lifelong reader,” 
said Kim Kozlowski, founder of Detroit 
Little Libraries and reporter for the 
Detroit News, in an interview with The 
Michigan Daily. Detroit Little Librar-
ies started in 2014 as a grassroots cam-
paign with the goal of making Detroit 
the “Little Free Library capitol of the 
world.” Detroit Little Libraries operates 
separately from the Little Free Libraries 
nonprofit, but the two organizations have 
a strong tradition of collaboration. Since 
its founding, Detroit Little Libraries has 

raised funds to build hundreds of Little 
Libraries throughout the city, includ-
ing 97 placed in front of Detroit Public 
Schools.
After installing her first Little Free 
Library in front of her home, Kozlowski 
was thrilled at the sense of community it 
brought to her neighborhood. She hoped 
to bring that same momentum to Detroit, 
a city climbing out of bankruptcy at the 
time. “Books promote your imagina-
tion, increase your vocabulary and your 
critical thinking skills. It can ultimate-
ly change the trajectory of your life,” 
Kozlowski said.
Kozlowski was aware of the stereo-
types that surrounded Detroit and hoped 
to flip this image by promoting literacy. 
“I had hope that if even one book could 
change the course of a child’s life in the 
city, then it was worth all the work we 
were doing,” Kozlowski said. Many of the 

libraries are made from reclaimed wood 
from abandoned Detroit homes, courtesy 
of End Grain Woodworking Co. Detroit 
Little Libraries also worked to include 
books by diverse authors in their librar-
ies. “We wanted to make sure there were 
books in the library that reflected the 
community and the diverse tapestry that 
Detroit is,” Kozlowski said.
Most of the impacts of Little Free 
Libraries have been anecdotal — only a 
few critical studies have been published. 
Little Free Libraries often become com-
munity gathering areas, bringing the 
neighborhood closer together through a 
shared love of books. “We started talk-
ing about not only the books we were 
reading, but also our lives,” Kozlowski 
said of a patron to her first Little Library. 
With this community impact in mind, 
Kozlowski worked with neighborhood 
groups and local artists to install, main-

tain and paint many of Detroit’s Little 
Libraries.
One of Kozwalski’s greatest challenges 
was ensuring that her libraries ended 
up in neighborhoods that could use it 
the most. Since the death of the original 
founder of Little Free Libraries, Todd 
Bol, in 2018, the movement has shifted 
to target neighborhoods with the great-
est need for literacy. One such neigh-
borhood is Brightmoor, Detroit, where I 
started a Little Free Library in front of 
a church I volunteered at. I replenished 
books regularly, scavenging through my 
house to find novels I read as a child. 
When I returned the following week, the 
books were nearly all gone. In contrast, 
the Little Library built in my hometown 
neighborhood of Canton, a middle-class 
suburb, doesn’t see nearly as much use.

It’s time to talk about the Schlissel memes

Repurposing Little Free Libraries during COVID

Writer’s Note: The Michigan Daily reached 
out to these sources over Instagram. We 
can not verify their identities, but they have 
identified as the admins of these Instagram 
accounts.
When your university’s president is put 
on blast for flirting through the proverbial 
family iPad, you don’t just brush it off.
It’s time to talk about the Schlissel memes. 
They take many forms: a Yik Yak post, a 
cheeky affirmation, a spray paint install-
ment in the Diag. Instead of an outpouring 
of disappointment or grief, students are 
resorting to humor, which is easy enough to 
understand, as joking is the simplest way to 
cope with shame, a fact further amplified by 
the absurdity of the situation.
We reached out to a number of Schlissel 
memers on Instagram for a look into the 
motivations of the students indulging in 
the tomfoolery. If you have a pulse and you 
own a cell phone, you probably know exactly 
what I’m talking about. @umich_ince-
llectuals, best described as a U-M-specific 
reimagining of the vastly popular meme 
page 
@on_a_downward_spiral, 
kicked 
off the memes with a series of text posts. 
The earliest read “WE JUST LOST THE 
SCHLUSSY” over a portrait of a grinning 
Schlissel. Another said “who else up lonely-
ing their ms.” My personal favorite from the 

account was an edited photo of Schlissel’s 
twitter with a blacked out profile picture 
and “Gone. Don’t text me or hmu” in the bio.
@umichcapsbabes, which popped up 
fairly recently, jumped on the train with a 
similar slew of memes. Their most popular, 
with over 200 likes, poked fun at the famed 
YouTube apology format, titled “my truth” 
with Schlissel in the thumbnail. Another 
meme read “me leaving Pizza House with 
10 extra calzones up my ass” over a cheery-
faced Schlissel.
@umichaffirmations, known by almost 
12,000 followers for their cleverly specific 
affirmation-based U-M memes, made a 
carousel post of memes catered towards 
Schlissel. Some include, “I WILL NOT Send 
Raunchy Messages From My Work Email,” 
“WHAT IF WE MISSED OUR CONNEC-
TION IN PARIS” and “I Will Not Be Lured 
In With The Promise Of A Knish.” 
What got to me about @incellectuals and 
the other pages was how fast they respond-
ed to the news and how they decided to go 
about it — for some reason, their immediate 
reaction to reading those 118 emails was to 
make memes. When asked about the use of 
memes as a response, one of the @umich_
incellectuals admins responded over Ins-
tagram DMs: “I think the memes were 
inevitable, the fuck them kids memes were 
already all over campus, we made a few too 
and like rightly so everyone already had a 
pretty low opinion.” The account’s second 
admin seemed to agree: “The way memes 

came almost immediately after his firing 
were kind of reflective of like the almost 
comedic relationship that’s been existing 

between schlissel and the student body for 
nearly 2 years.”
The admin from @umichcapsbabes had 
some thoughts about the meaning of the 
memes: “What makes them funny is that 
someone took time out of their day to make 
an edit for the bursley baits loop for abso-
lutely no reason. Mark Schlissel is a grown 
man who’s probably at home very concerned 
about his public image and everyone else is 

just like yeahhh it makes sense that he’s a 
calzone man.” 
@umichaffirmations’s admin ties up the 

issue with a nihilistic bow: “The fact that 
our university president is having an affair is 
an absolutely absurd and unfortunate situa-
tion. But so is living through a massive pan-
demic. So is the fact that we have single-digit 
weather. We can either live life accepting the 
bad things, or cope with them via humor.” 
While I personally don’t enjoy accepting 
these things with complacency, I struggle 
to find a better alternative. But maybe I’m 

looking at it the wrong way. 
Yes, it’s funny — I will never get tired of 
“lonely m”— but what exactly is the joke 
here? That our No. 1 ranked University, with 
its illustrious Board of Regents and its $17 
billion endowment, was spearheaded by 
someone incompetent enough to send hotel 
receipts to Individual 1 over his University 
email? That our president, our emblem, likes 
his calzones with extra mushrooms and his 
salads topped with cherries? The latter is not 
so incriminating, but his behavior towards 
Jon Vaughn is. Far worse than a string of 
silly emails is the impotent response to the 
Robert Anderson case and, most important-
ly, its survivors — Schlissel disgraced this 
institution long before Communications.pdf 
was in the picture. In fact, many might agree 
that his firing in and of itself is hypocritical.
There are jokes, but as the first @umich_
incellectuals admin says, “At first I thought 
he’d been fired over the Anderson case, 
which would have been ideal because his 
conduct over that has been disgraceful and a 
huge dark cloud over the university.” 
Maybe Schlissel will return to the com-
fort of his tenure as a professor. Maybe 
some rightfully vindictive MCDB majors 
will heckle him to embarrassment during 
office hours, or maybe he will retreat into 
his 401(k)-padded cave and never be heard 
from again. There’s also the possibility that 
Mary Sue Coleman won’t do a better job. At 
the very least, the idea that our frustrations 
might become a tangible force is reassuring.

Perhaps family is a set of rela-
tionships characterized by DNA or 
“blood,” as age-old proverbs may 
indicate. But this definition may not 
be so all-encompassing; for one, it 
would render adoption illegitimate 
and negates what some of us consider 
our “chosen families.” When we shift 
our lens to Southeastern Asia, specif-
ically Tibet, this rigidity surrounding 
the ways we define familial relation-
ships becomes more complex.
In 
Carole 
McGranahan’s 
essay 
“What is a Family? Refugee DNA and 
the Possible Truths of Kinship,” she 
discusses the story of Tashi, a Tibetan 
man who traveled as a refugee to Can-
ada, leaving his wife and four children 
in a refugee camp in south Asia to 
await the legal process for later fam-
ily reunification. The Canadian gov-
ernment, which employs DNA testing 
to verify claims of family relations 
(on the inaccurate basis that refugees 
are prone to lying and deceiving legal 
systems), asserted that Tashi would 
need to take a DNA test to prove that 
he was his childrens’ father, as he had 
claimed he was. When the results of 
the test returned, it was discovered 
that he was not the biological father 
of his children, indicating that his 
wife had an extramarital affair. This 
was the first time he had heard of this 
infidelity; yet, because the genetic 
father had never claimed nor met the 
children, Tashi had always been the 
father of his children. According to 
the Canadian immigration process, 
Tashi was untruthful and not the 
father of his children. But in Tibet, 
this test indicates nothing about the 
truth — or lack thereof — of Tashi’s 
fatherhood.
The familial structure in Tibet can 
be described as patrilineal and some-
times polyandrous. Perhaps, though, 
assigning Western names and con-
cepts to this may lead us astray in 
our understanding of Tibetan society. 
Non-genetic fathers may claim chil-
dren that are not genetically related 
to them and, if not bound by marriage, 
genetic fathers can choose whether or 
not to claim their children. Whether 
or not children are absorbed into 
the patrilineage determines their 
roles in society and within the fam-
ily. In a polyandrous family, wherein 
a Tibetan woman is married to a set 

of brothers, all husbands are equally 
considered father by all her chil-
dren. It is worth noting as well that 
extramarital affairs are not accepted 
in traditional Tibetan society and 
often result in physical punishment. 
But, knowledge of infidelity does not 
cancel out a father’s paternity of his 
children. Thus, family in Tibet much 
more than a biological marking — it 
is a system of care, kinship beyond 
blood and mutual understanding and 
service. 
DNA testing in the Western world 
is often the ultimate truth of father-
hood. TV shows, such as “Maury” and 
“The Jerry Springer Show,” have their 
premise entirely based on testing 
paternity genealogically. The moment 
that the test results are revealed, 
fathers (or non-fathers) jump for joy, 
revel in an I-told-you-so moment, 
or hang their heads in despair. And 
in that moment, they choose how to 
define their relationship with the 
child they may or may not have pre-
viously known — or at the least, they 
begin to wonder what they will do. 
This is a significant determinant of 
their fatherhood and their relation-
ship (or lack thereof) with the child. 
Understanding DNA testing as truth 
requires a rigid, medicalized lens, 
wherein the concept of family has 
entered the purview of medicine and 
is therefore intrinsically biomedical; 
in this medicalized perspective, fam-
ily is defined strictly by genetic and 
biological indicators. Immigration 
processes in Canada, which require 
the use of DNA testing, are thus com-
pletely closed off to those who view 
their families and communities as 
anything other than biological. And 
as McGranahan argues, DNA testing 
relies on “categories of belonging that 
do not necessarily belong to the group 
being tested.” Canada’s family reuni-
fication process is more than simply 
a matter of truth versus lie; instead, 
it is a carefully exacted aim at 
determining worthiness based on 
Western conceptions and an actu-
alization of harmful stereotypes 
and misconceptions about immi-
grants through biological tools.
In Tashi’s story, family is medi-
calized, and institutions — in this 
case, the Canadian government and 
its immigration process — employ 
biopower (biological methods used 
to exert sociopolitical control over 
populations) to decide who is wor-
thy of entry and livelihood. The bio-

medical perspective employed by the 
immigration forces directly opposes 
the systems of collective care, fam-
ily structure and lineage that exist in 
Tibet. The results of Tashi’s test were 
more than the results of paternity; 
they provided immigration officials 
a claim of power—a false notion that 
they had determined the absolute 
truth about Tashi’s family and that 
only they had the ability to determine 
this truth. As McGranahan notes, 
if DNA testing shows that a Tibetan 
parent and child are not genetically 
related as such, the Canadian govern-
ment is not required to follow up on 
this claim. It becomes a burden that 
the applicant must take on to appeal 
the results of the test and provide 
substantial evidence through docu-
mentation that proves the familial 
relationship. But, in the case of Tashi 
and other Tibetan refugees, such doc-
umentation may not exist. In Tibet, 
birth and marriage certificates are 
not traditional processes; the legiti-
macy of birth, marriage, and identity 
are not determined by documents, as 
they are in Canada and in many cases, 
the Western world altogether. If these 
documents are unavailable to appeal 
the decision of the immigration 
office, the appeal process becomes 
reliant upon telling one’s narrative 
through an immigration attorney and 
from the letters of friends, acquain-
tances, and even Tibetan government 
officials. This process is often long 
and arduous, and requires notions 
of “proof” that may be inconsistent 
between these two nations across the 
globe from one another. Indeed, this 
truth in and of itself is inconsistent 
between Tibet and Canada. In Tibet, 
family is not so clear-cut; the truth of 
familial relationships is determined 
solely by those involved and is not a 
decision for the government. The lines 
between family and not-family are 
blurred within the system of commu-
nity care and mutual aid that Tibetan 
society renders of utmost value. As 
the Canadian government and West-
ern immigration offices define, fami-
ly is a “yes” or “no,” a “true” or “false” 
determined by genealogical testing. 
When these worlds meet, with exist-
ing anti-immigrant rhetoric and bias 
on the part of the Canadian govern-
ment, the Western refugee system is 
likely to employ its many loopholes 
that have been carefully constructed 
to restrict individuals and families 
from the lives they seek.

Palestine. The Holy Land. An ancient 
motherland, where every nook and cranny 
possesses a piece of sacred history. Home 
of the olive tree: a renowned symbol of 
peace and tranquility yet trampled in the 
face of oppression. A centuries-old fruit 
bearer, ripped from its roots, as though it 
holds no weight, no meaning. 
I’ve been lucky enough to be allowed 
entry into my beautiful homeland four 
times before. I was very young the first 
time and didn’t know much, but I could 
see the guns and tanks everywhere we 
went and hear the innocent children as 
they screamed at soldiers to put them 
down. After crossing the Allenby bridge at 
the Jordanian border and waiting for over 
a day at military checkpoints in the occu-
pied West Bank with nausea sweeping 
over me through the countless bumpy bus 
rides, we had finally arrived at my grand-
parents’ house in the small village of Kifl 
Haris. They immediately greeted me: my 
sitti with her warm embrace, and my sido 
lifting me up into the air while screams 
of joy escaped me, my fatigue superseded 
by the excitement of seeing my estranged 
family. When he finally put me down, the 
sound of a small kitten drew me near the 
back of the house. In an attempt to follow 
the soft purrs, I stumbled upon their col-
orful garden, pervaded by plants I did not 
know the names of. Treading through the 
greens with careful steps, the leaves of the 
fruits and flowers brushed over the back 
of my hand, tickling me as though they 
longed for the presence of a child among 
them. Using one of the purple plastic 
chairs lying on the back deck, I stood to 
reach grape vines hanging above me and 
climbed trees to pluck sweet figs and bitter 

pomegranates. My arms overflowing with 
fruit and with a kitten in tow, I emerged 
15 minutes later with the biggest smile 
plastered onto my face. Seeing how much 
I adored their garden, my grandparents 
were excited to introduce me to their emi-
nent glory: their olive tree groves. After 
freshening up, we all piled into my grand-
pa’s 10-year-old Volkswagen that rattled at 
every turn. As we drove the short distance 
together, I was awestruck by the majestic 
mountains that crowned the landscape 
and the palm trees that lined the streets. 
Children played soccer with a makeshift 
ball while soldiers strapped with AK-47s 
loomed in the background.
As we approached our destination, I 
nearly jumped out of the moving car as 
I got a glimpse of what awaited me. The 
beautiful earthy green field was filled 
with olive trees standing tall, laden with 
olives and stretching beyond the corners 
of my eyes. Waving at me in the breeze, 
they begged me to climb up their strong 
limbs and pluck their olives gently. For 
the second time that day, I was completely 
blown away by the scene that surrounded 
me. As I ran towards the first tree I laid 
eyes on, standing on my tiptoes to reach 
the tall branches, my sido hauled me up on 
his shoulders. While I struggled to grab as 
many as I could, my sido grabbed my wrist 
and set me back down. He explained why 
we don’t pick olives one by one — there 
are simply too many of them on each tree. 
Instead, with his instruction, we spread 
out a few white cloth sheets underneath 
the tree. As my sido beat the olive tree 
with his wooden cane, the sheet-covered 
ground beneath us quickly filled with 
black and green olives. While I sorted 
through the ripe black olives and put 
away the firm green ones that still had 
to be cured, the olives gleamed under the 
scorching sun. I suddenly wondered if my 

ancestors also experienced this feeling of 
inner peace at this very spot while they 
sorted through olives like me. 
While we worked, my sido told me sto-
ries about the history of the land: ancient 
prophets who roamed the lush fields cen-
turies ago, the religious significance of 
the monotheistic faiths associated with 
the region and the Crusades that were 
fought not far from where we were stand-
ing. His face was overtaken with a child-
like marvel when describing the spiritual 
aura surrounding the Al-Aqsa mosque and 
golden Dome of Rock, but the light in his 
eyes dimmed when he mentioned the 
Gaza Strip, which was still under com-
plete siege. This meant that little kids like 
me had restricted access to clean water 
to wash their favorite shirts or take baths 
with their toys. They were forbidden from 
getting too close to the beach, even on 
a bright summer day. They were denied 
usage of electricity to watch TV as their 
family shared breakfast or stay up late to 
play computer games. They were barred 
from traveling for vacations or leaving 
Gaza to visit family. They were stripped of 
the opportunity to grow up and attend col-
lege or carry dreams for their future. As I 
listened to my sido in silence, blood rushed 
to my head and tears welled up in my eyes. 
I gripped each olive harder, afraid that 
they would fall out of my trembling hands 
and smash on the ground. How could the 
world remain silent as children suffered 
under such brutal conditions? How could 
a land famous for its olive trees not know 
peace? 
The answer: settler-colonialism in all 
its glory. Settler colonialism is a distinct 
form of colonialism that seeks to uproot 
and dispossess the indigenous popula-
tion of a desired land, replacing them with 
a new group of colonizing settlers, while 
ruling over the remaining indigenous 

peoples through an imperialist authori-
tative structure. The state of Israel is, in 
fact, a settler colony, and its Zionist ide-
ology is rooted in the dispossession and 
ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people. 
Israel’s propaganda machine, however, 
supervises and censors raw footage, pre-
senting the world with a one-sided narra-
tive while giving no room for Palestinian 
voices to be heard. It has painted a picture 
in which colonized Palestinians are the 
sole aggressors, leaving the poor colonizer 
Israel, the principal nuclear power in the 
Middle East, with no choice but to defend 

itself. Part of Israel’s dangerous rhetoric 
to depict itself as the victim is through 
an intentional conflation of anti-Zionism 
with antisemitism. This draws sympathy 
and unwavering support for Israel from 
the Western world, rendering it nearly 
impossible to criticize Israel and its use of 
brute force against Palestinians without 
being labeled an antisemite. 
So, how then, can I tell my side of the 
story without being silenced? How can 
I appeal to a Western audience who is 

already dead set on the fact that I belong to 
a group of savage terrorists and convince 
them of my right to freely exist? Is the only 
way I have to tell my story through the 
lens of an innocent happy child spending 
time with her grandparents, picking fruits 
and olives? Must I always omit the grue-
some details of settler-colonialism and the 
constant threat of dispossession in favor of 
descriptions of pretty scenery? Can I only 
garner support for my dignity by slipping 
in the subtleties of living under an excru-
ciatingly violent military occupation with 
a smile on my face? Why is it expected that 

I accept the subjugation with my head low 
to avoid upsetting my oppressor and its 
supporters?
How can I remain silent when an apart-
heid power is actively profiting off of the 
conquest of my land? How can I be asked 
to “understand both sides” when a colo-
nizer still denies me access to the land my 
ancestors called home less than 73 years 
ago? How can I extend an olive branch to 
an oppressor who consistently denies my 
existence and tries to erase my story?

The William Trotter Multicultural

an even greater need to preserve the

we do not lose sight of the communi-

senior Karla Bell, who serves as the 
Seba (Historian) on the Black Student 
Union 2021-2022 Executive Board. 
Trotter was originally called Trot-
ter House and was colloquially known 
as the “Black House” amongst Black 
students. Directly resulting from the 
actions of the first (of three) Black 
Action Movements, Trotter House 
was built in 1971 as a Black Student 
Cultural Center to meet the needs of 
Black students on campus. When talk-
ing about the early beginnings of Trot-
ter, Bell said, “Black students really 
only had Trotter, and it was neither 
in a safe location on campus nor well 
funded. Trotter was funded and built 
at the hands of student labor.” 
Trotter House was the host building 
for events for Black students, but they 
had to risk their safety to be able to use 
the space. Bell said, “At the time, Black 
people on campus were susceptible to 
violence and danger because (Trotter 
House) was off-campus in a poorly lit 
area. Yet still, they risked their well-
being to be there.” In 1972, the origi-
nal Trotter House burned down in a 
kitchen fire so the University bought 
a building on Washtenaw Avenue to 
house the student center. By 1981, 
Trotter House would expand its scope 
to become a multicultural student cen-
ter. As the Trotter House expanded 
to include programming for students 
of all racial minorities on campus, 
Black Student Union executive board 
members tried to appeal for increased 
funding from the University to expand 
their efforts in promoting equity on 
campus.
In 2013, undergraduate and gradu-
ate students began “A New Trotter 
Initiative,” a plan to have a new mul-
ticultural center be built at the cen-
ter of campus. After three years of 
advocating to the University of Mich-
igan administration for a new build-

ing, a $10 million budget was finally 
approved in 2016 for the building of 
The William Trotter Multicultural 
Center. By 2019, Trotter had official-
ly found a new home on South State 
Street and was open for student use. 
Currently, less than 4% of the U-M 
undergraduate population is Black, 
making it easy to feel like an outsider 
in most spaces on campus. Because of 
this, Trotter is an essential space for 
Black students. It exists as our place to 
congregate; it’s one of the only build-
ings on campus that feels as though 
it belongs to Black students — a home 
base of sorts where we can build fel-
lowship, work together and exist in the 
comfort of our own community. This is 
why Trotter is frequently used by orga-
nizations like BSU and HEADS (Here 
Earning A Destiny through Honesty, 
Eagerness, And Determination of Self) 
to hold their meetings. Students of 
Color, and specifically Black students, 
commonly frequent the multicultural 
center, which speaks to its necessity in 
the community. 
For me personally, I find myself 
in Trotter after a day of classes more 
often than not. I always know I’ll 
run into at least a few of my friends 
every time I step into the building. 
Between homework assignments, I’ll 
usually take a break from my work to 
make conversation with them and joke 
around. If I’m not doing homework or 
hanging out with friends, then usu-
ally I’m somehow finding my way into 
the activities that might be going on 
in Trotter that day, like a game night 
or a cultural event. There is such an 
intrinsic sense of community in Trot-
ter, which makes it unlike any other 
building on campus. 
“If you’re coming into Trotter, learn 
the history of the space and respect 
the effort that it took to have this,” 
Bell said. “(Black) students lost their 
scholarships for this and faced con-
sequences to have Trotter as a space.” 
Everyone who comes into Trotter, 
whether it be for personal use or for an 
organization, should be mindful that 
such a space came directly from Black 
activism. There is a rich history behind 
how Trotter has transformed into the 
multicultural center that we know it as 
today and this history is intertwined 
with the Black Action Movements.
I’m grateful to the Black students 
who fought to have a building like 
Trotter on campus and as we use the 
space to build fellowship amongst 
underrepresented groups on campus, 
it’s imperative that we continue to pass 
down the history as well.

Graduation Edition 2022 — 9
Michigan in Color
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

As a person of color, any type of 
application, whether it be college, job 
or internship applications are always 
equipped with stress, self-doubt and 
insecurity. I feel alone in academic 
and social settings at the University 
of Michigan, with about 55% of the 
student population being white and 
the median family income being a 
staggering $154,000 for the Fall 2020 
undergraduate population. I, as a 
minority student who does not have 
the privilege of wealth nor whiteness, 
have had to endure a college experi-
ence overrun by feelings of imposter 
syndrome. Here at the University, I 
constantly feel the pressure of social 
and economic factors like race and 
social class that lead me to lose belief 
in myself academically and profession-
ally. I dream to go to law school and 
become a lawyer, which I know will 
force me to exist within more intimi-
dating environments of professional-
ism, whiteness and years of enhanced 
feelings of being an imposter. 
Interacting with students in my 
sociology, political science and pub-
lic policy classes has resulted in very 
interesting yet uncomfortable conver-
sations. It seems like almost every stu-
dent has been interning for their local 
congressman since high school and 
have parents who own their own law 
firm. Comparing my background and 
experiences to others, the overwhelm-
ing sense of competition makes me 
anxious and worried about my future 
at the University and beyond due to 
my lack of experience compared to my 
peers. When it comes to discussions 
surrounding internships or any other 
professional opportunity, the number 
of white students who seem to have 
been handed positions because of their 
family’s privilege is honestly astound-
ing. 
This past January, I started my 
application to the Ford School of Pub-
lic Policy. Even before the start of 
my freshman year, I already knew I 
wanted to apply to this program come 
the winter of my sophomore year, and 
I worked my ass off both academically 
and professionally to try to secure an 
acceptance. I completed the prereq-
uisites courses early, pursued intern-
ships that aligned with my political 
interests and became an involved stu-
dent at the University to solidify that 
public policy was my passion while 
proving to admissions that I was a 
dedicated student. I thought what I 
was doing would be enough and that 
I would stand out among hundreds of 
applicants all competing for a spot in 
the 70- to 80-person cohort. But when 
talking to other students who had the 
same dream of attending the Public 
Policy School, it seemed that their 
experiences, grades and accomplish-
ments were much more prestigious 

than mine. And when it was time to 
start my application, I needed to think 
of something that made me different 
from the rest of the applicants. There 
was an easy conclusion: my ethnicity. 
I am a Latino student at the Univer-
sity; I am a part of the mere 6.98% of 
the undergraduate population that is 
Latinx.
Diversity has been proven to be 
beneficial in the classroom. Whether 
it’s ethnicity, socioeconomic class or 
religion that sets individual students 
apart, learning in diverse environ-
ments improves students’ cognitive 
skills and critical thinking. By boost-
ing an individual’s abilities and intel-
lect, diverse classrooms nurture 
further academic success and inno-
vation. More diverse classrooms not 
only make me feel more comfortable, 
but they also create an open space for 
dialogue regarding important issues 
affecting various cultures and ethnici-
ties. I knew my ethnicity would ben-
efit the Public Policy School’s cohort, 
but I did not want to wonder if I had 
only been accepted for the sake of the 
school’s diversity numbers. My impos-
ter syndrome made me feel that my 
experiences and grades would not be 
enough for the acceptance email that 
I’ve been dreaming of since I learned 
about the Public Policy School. 
I had to come to accept that a major-
ity of the students applying, on paper, 
most likely appeared to admissions as 
identical. So many of us are pre-law, 
political science majors waiting on an 
acceptance to the Public Policy School. 
Most of us are politically active and 
involved in related organizations on 
campus, and some of us naively believe 
we can become president one day. Due 
to this, I knew the one place I could 
truly stand out would be in the applica-
tion essays. It felt like the three 300- to 
400-word essays would determine my 
future. 
After filling out basic demographic 
information in the early part of the 
online application, it was finally time 
to view the essay prompts. Unsur-
prisingly, the first one was the staple 
“diversity essay.” 
This year’s prompt started out by 
informing the applicants about how 
research has shown that diverse work 
groups are better at solving problems. 
They noted, however, that working in 
such groups can present considerable 
challenges to students who struggle 
to work with others from different 
backgrounds. The question then asked 
the applicants to write about an expe-
rience working in a diverse setting 
and specifically asked that the essay 
be focused around the challenges of 
working with differences. The final 
part of the prompt questioned the 
applicants to discuss in what ways one 
could improve on how productive and 
respectful they were to others of a dif-
ferent background. 
Though I was expecting at least 
one essay to prompt me about my 

background, this question was the 
most difficult one to write, taking me 
weeks of constant drafting and edit-
ing. I think it’s important for admis-
sions committees to ask questions 
which allow students to vulnerably 
talk about their identities, but when 
it comes to this specific question, it 
seemed that the committee was only 
trying to see how white students have 
been able to interact in diverse set-
tings. Instead of just asking about an 
experience in working in a diverse 
community, they asked about how the 
environment was challenging. After 
rereading the prompt over and over, I 
began to get angry. In what environ-
ment at the University have I had the 
opportunity to even work in a diverse 
setting? To me, this question asked, 
“How, as a person of color, have you 
faced challenges working in a diverse 
environment despite never being in 
one?” I’m almost always one of about 
three Latinx students in 300-person 
lectures, the only person of color in 
discussion sections and one of four 
brown students crossing the entire 
Diag, the center of the University. In 
all of my group projects and breakout 
rooms, I often find myself having to 
settle without having my ideas appre-
ciated, being talked over and feeling 
stupid. I wish I had the opportunity to 
work in a diverse group setting so that 
I could finally be listened to, not doubt-
ed or ignored, but that is simply not the 
reality here at the University. 
I reflected on the final part of the 
aforementioned prompt: “Are there 
things you wish you had done differ-
ently or might do differently in the 
future to work more respectfully and 
productively with people who dif-
fer from you?” No, but this question 
caters to white students who trample 
the minority students at this school, 
creating a welcoming prompt for them 
to ease their way into. When talking 
to older friends in the Public Policy 
School who helped edit my essay, we 
all agreed that this prompt seemed 
to be purposefully phrased so that 
admissions would be able to see which 
white students were “woke” in appre-
ciating diversity and understanding 
its importance. These students are 
obviously necessary for a holistically 
diverse environment, but the ease of 
being able to discuss working with 
people of different backgrounds pro-
vides advantages to white applicants 
over actual students who would con-
tribute to a diverse cohort. I am a 
person of color who has solely been in 
majority-white environments, I could 
not think of a time where I faced a 
challenge working across differences, 
because I have rarely been presented 
with differences in my work environ-
ments. A challenge I have to constant-
ly deal with is not being valued as a 
thinker and student within the class-
room. It’s not my duty to respectfully 
and productively work with students 
who can’t see past my skin color. 

When I sat down with Moon Choe, 

owner and operator of Moon Cafe, a 

Korean restaurant and frozen yogurt 

shop on State Street, for a 40-minute 

interview, I’ll admit I expected some-

thing of a sob story: a few cliché sen-

timents about being down on his luck 

and needing students to stop by so he 

can pay the bills. What I got instead 

was a chance to gain new insights 

on laissez-faire parenting, the subtle 

racism that is a hallmark of the immi-

grant experience and the private 

joys he is able to embrace from the 

COVID-19 pandemic, among other 

topics of discussion. Choe is full of 

surprising wisdom, which he dishes 

out freely, sans condescension.

As soon as you walk in, Moon Cafe 

comforts you. The walls are painted 

yellow and purple, clashing with the 

black-and-white checkerboard floor. 

Large-framed, abstract art prints 

hang on the walls, and the entire 

stretch of a mantel piece is lined with 

small figurines. The eclectic interior 

reminds me of the yummy hole-in-

the-wall eateries my friends and I 

frequented during our high school 

years back at home and immediately 

assuages those requisite nerves I 

feel as a newcomer to the journalism 

scene.

Choe is in his early 60s and, despite 

his gray hair, looks much younger 

than his years. On the afternoon that 

I walk into his shop, he wears wire 

glasses, a yellow University of Michi-

gan hoodie (like the true Michigan 

dad he is) with a few sauce stains, 

comfy sweatpants and padded slides 

with Puma socks. He’s dressed, in 

other words, for a long shift at the res-

taurant. Choe is thoughtful and very 

eloquent. Though he gestures for me 

to take a seat at the booth in front of 

him, he never quite settles into the 

bench facing me. Instead, he hovers 

by it, always ready to take a call or 

hand a customer their order.

I’m caught off guard when Choe 

begins the interview by throwing me 

the first question: he wants to know 

what my position at The Michigan 

Daily is. I tell him I’m a Senior MiC 

Editor, and he nods and replies that 

his daughter, Gina, also used to hold 

a Senior Editor position at The Daily 

during her undergraduate years. In 

our brief conversation, he mentions 

his children’s academic achievements 

several times. I can tell by the way he 

casually namedrops “neuroscience at 

Princeton” that he speaks of his son 

and daughter fondly and often.

Much of Choe’s identity is, in many 

ways, tied to his role as a father and 

husband. Shortly into our conversa-

tion, Choe takes a phone order and 

calls out to the kitchen: “Yeobo? Spicy 

pork!” (Yeobo is a pet name, roughly 

translated from Korean to “darling” 

or “honey.”) Later, she calls him dang-

shin — another sweet term of endear-

ment — when they’re working in the 

kitchen together. While trying to 

put into words what it’s like to work 

with his wife, he chuckles and says, 

“I cannot think of any bad things. 

Just wake up early in the morning, eat 

together — we always eat together … 

there’s no special meaning, we’re just 

married … and then we spend time 

together. That’s it.” The restaurant 

is a two-person operation. Last year, 

they employed a couple U-M students 

part-time, but now, since business is 

slower than usual, it’s just Choe and 

his wife, Yoon, running the cafe.

Choe and Yoon, along with their 

son and daughter, immigrated to 

America from South Korea nearly 15 

years ago and eventually settled in 

Ann Arbor, Mich. During his career, 

Choe worked in the automotive 

industry for 32 years. (His engineer-

ing background shows in the way he 

tends to speak in exact figures, pre-

cise times and percentages.) When 

he retired a couple years back, he 

decided he wanted to take on “fresh 

and new” work. “My (children) grew 

up here in Ann Arbor … so it is our 

town,” he tells me. He decided to open 

a frozen yogurt shop to meet new stu-

dents, and he calls this new job a dif-

ferent type of “good stress.”

Michigan finds its Beilein 
replacement, hires Juwan Howard

MAX MARCOVITCH
2019 Managing Sports Editor

The 
Michigan 
basketball 
program is entering a new era by 
harkening back to an old one.
Miami Heat assistant coach 
and former Fab Five star Juwan 
Howard has been hired to be the 
Wolverines’ next head coach, as 
first reported by Jon Rothstein of 
CBS Sports and officially confirmed 
by Michigan spokesman Tom 
Wywrot on Wednesday. Howard 
is set to replace John Beilein, who 
accepted a head coaching job with 
the Cleveland Cavaliers last Monday 
after 12 seasons in Ann Arbor. It will 
be a five-year deal, according to Jeff 
Goodman of Stadium.
Howard will be the 17th men’s 
basketball coach in school history.
“I am very excited about the 
opportunity to lead the University 
of Michigan’s storied basketball 
program,” Howard said in a press 
release. “I have been very fortunate 
to be part of a great championship 
organization in the Miami Heat 
for the last nine years — three as 
a player and six as a coach. It was 
always going to take something 
incredibly special for me to leave 
Miami; however, I know in my heart 
this is the right place and the right 
time.
“As a ‘Michigan Man’ I know the 
place our program has in college 
basketball and I embrace the chance 
to build onto that history and lead 
us to championships both in the 
Big Ten and national level. We will 
continue to develop young men on 
the court, in the classroom and in 
the community that our fan base 
will continue to be proud of.”

Howard spent 19 years as a player 
in the NBA, making one All Star team 
and winning two NBA titles. Upon 
his retirement in 2013, Howard was 
hired by the Miami Heat, where he 
has since held an assistant coaching 
position. In recent weeks, his name 
has popped up as one of interest 
for NBA head coaching openings. 
According 
to 
ESPN’s 
Adrian 
Wojnarowski, Howard interviewed 
with the Minnesota Timberwolves 
for the franchise’s head coaching 
position, a job which ultimately went 
to Ryan Saunders.
“I’m happy for Juwan, Jenine and 
his family, and feel he is deserving 
of this opportunity to coach at the 
University of Michigan,” said Heat 
president Pat Riley in a press release. 
“He is going back to a school and a 
conference in which he is revered. 
I think it is a great step forward for 
him and the University, and I wish 
him nothing but the best, because 
that’s what he’s given us.”
Added Heat head coach Erik 
Spoelstra: “Juwan is an absolute star 
as a person, player and coach. I feel 
he is more than ready. He is a terrific 
leader and mentor, which translates 
very well to the collegiate level. While 
we are losing a valuable member 
of our staff and a great friend, I am 
happy for him and his family. He will 
forever be a champion and part of the 
HEAT family and I am excited to see 
him take the next step.”
Most around campus, though, 
still associate Howard with his days 
wearing the maize and blue, as a key 
cog in the Fab Five squads of the early 
1990s that still hold strong cultural 
significance at the school. Howard 
averaged over 20 points per game in 
1993-94, his last college season.
Fellow Fab Five teammates Jalen 

Rose and Jimmy King have been 
among Howard’s stanchest public 
advocates since Beilein announced 
his departure — which certainly 
portends a fully-healed relationship 
between the Fab Five and the athletic 
department.
“There’s a guy named Juwan 
Howard that’s from Chicago,” Rose 
said on Get Up!, his morning ESPN 
show, last Friday. “He’s going to be 
able to help recruit that market. All-
American in high school, came to 
the University of Michigan and was 
a member of the Fab Five. He was 
the first person to sign their Letter 
of Intent. In theory, he also helped 
recruit each one of us. He was always 
the adult in the room amongst us.”
“I think Juwan is the guy who 
can pick up the torch and carry it 
even further,” King said, per the 
Detroit Free Press, at the third 
annual Champions for Change 
Gala at Crisler Center to benefit the 
ChadTough Foundation.
The program has gone through 
ebbs and flows since the early ‘90s, 
but in many ways it is still tethered 
to that group; the hiring of Howard is 
a nod to that. For that reason, he will 
begin his tenure with some goodwill 
among fans and baked-in cache with 
recruits.
That’s not to suggest the task will 
be easy.
The 
long-term 
challenge? 
Sustaining the success Beilein left, 
after cultivating the greatest era 
in program history. No small feat, 
either.
But it’s a challenge he and 
Michigan are clearly ready to take on. 
Over 25 years since leaving campus, 
Juwan Howard is back, set to pave 
a new path in Michigan basketball 
history.

Michigan gets signature win, 
beats Notre Dame, 45-14

ARIA GERSON
2019 Daily Sports Writer

Cesar Ruiz heard the question, 
then he cracked a smile.
“Do you guys feel like you wrote 
a memorable chapter in this rivalry 
tonight?”
The junior center responded 
immediately: “Um, yes.”
Last week, Michigan got its 
second loss at Penn State, effectively 
ending any hopes of a Big Ten 
championship and the College 
Football Playoff. In the days leading 
up to the Wolverines’w matchup 
with Notre Dame, the biggest 
question was clear: What is there 
still to play for?
Michigan players insisted there 
was still plenty, most of all the 
chance to beat their rivals, but it was 
still a little hard to believe. At least, 
until Hassan Haskins ran 25 yards 
— several with a tackler on his back 
— on the Wolverines’ second drive of 
the game, one that eventually ended 
in a Zach Charbonnet touchdown.
And as the heavens descended 
on Ann Arbor, Michigan seemed 
unfazed. An offense that had 
struggled for explosive plays all year 
ripped off four 20-plus yard runs in 
the first half alone. The Wolverines 
(6-2 overall, 3-2 Big Ten) rode that 
run game and their typical stingy 
defense to a 45-14 win over No. 8 
Notre Dame (5-2) in arguably the 
most impressive win of the Jim 

Harbaugh era.
“We realized after (last week), 
going into this week for Monday’s 
practice that offensively, we’ve gotta 
come out that way from start to 
finish,” said senior quarterback Shea 
Patterson. “You can’t come out flat 
and expect to make a comeback in 
the end. They helped out our defense, 
our defense played lights out tonight. 
I thought we executed all night 
offensively and I think the results 
show for themselves.”
Though Michigan had to settle for 
a field goal on its first drive, it made 
one thing clear: it was run-it-down-
their-throats time. 
Patterson didn’t complete a pass 
until the second quarter, after his 
team was already up 10-0 — and 
with the rainy conditions, it was 
probably for the better. After the 
field goal, the Wolverines scored 
touchdowns on two straight drives, 
both by freshman running back Zach 
Charbonnet. And after he pulled 
a defender with him on the first of 
those two drives, Haskins hurdled 
his would-be tackler in the second, 
an encore to a 20-yard rush that sent 
110,000 fans in maize ponchos into a 
frenzy.
“We said in the locker room, 
we knew what kind of game it was 
gonna be,” Ruiz said. “We changed 
the openers a little bit. We knew we 
were gonna be ground and pounding 
a lot today. It’s the game we’ve been 
waiting for. We love running the ball. 
And just, we knew today was gonna 
be the day we were gonna be able to 
showcase it.”

Haskins finished with 149 yards 
on 20 attempts, a career high, while 
Charbonnet added 74 yards on 
15 attempts for two touchdowns 
and tied a program-record nine 
touchdowns for a freshman running 
back.
As the rain slowed in the third 
quarter, so did Michigan — going 
three-and-out on three consecutive 
drives and then giving up a 
touchdown to cut its lead to 10. But 
the Wolverines stayed the course, 
coming back for a touchdown drive 
that included a Haskins 49-yard 
rush to put them up, 24-7. Then, they 
opened up the passing game and ran 
up the score with three touchdowns 
in the fourth quarter.
Through the entire game, the 
Wolverines found an offensive 
identity and stuck to it, never 
deviating from the run, even 
when those drives stalled in the 
third quarter. Notre Dame did the 
opposite, looking befuddled with 
every move Michigan made. Book 
readied to throw, even with pass-
rushers in his face on nearly every 
play, even when the ball slipped 
around as rain continued to fall.
With their fierce running game, 
the 
Wolverines 
answered 
the 
questions of offensive identity that 
have surrounded them all season. 
They also answered the question of 
whether a rivalry win was enough of 
a motivation for a team whose goals 
were much loftier.
As Michigan scored at will until 
the clock ran out, the answer to that 
question went without saying.

NCAA Tournament, all spring and winter competition 
canceled amid COVID-19 pandemic

DANIEL DASH
2020 Daily Sports Writer

INDIANAPOLIS 
— 
Unlike 
previous years, this March has been 
defined by the madness taking place 
off the hardwood.
Amid 
the 
global 
COVID-
19 pandemic, the 2020 NCAA 
Tournament has been cancelled, 
according to a release from the NCAA. 
All spring and winter competitions 
are cancelled as well.
“This decision is based on the 
evolving COVID-19 public health 
threat, our ability to ensure the events 
do not contribute to spread of the 
pandemic, and the impracticality of 
hosting such events at any time during 
this academic year given ongoing 
decisions by other entities,” NCAA 
President Mark Emmert said in a 
statement.
The decision comes mere hours 
after each major Division I conference 
pulled the plug on their conference 
tournaments. The Ivy League — 
which 
cancelled 
its 
conference 

tournament on Wednesday — was the 
first domino to fall, and the rest of the 
country followed suit shortly after.
Less than 20 minutes before 
the 
beginning 
of 
Thursday’s four-game 
Big Ten Tournament 
slate, 
conference 
commissioner 
Kevin 
Warren called off the 
tournament. Michigan 
and 
Rutgers 
were 
finishing 
pregame 
warmups 
when 
he 
made the final call.
Michigan will cease 
all athletic events — 
including 
offseason 
practices and spring 
recruiting — through 
the remainder of the 
2019-20 academic year 
as part of a Big Ten-
wide 
decision. 
The 
Wolverines will also 
forbid coaches from 
off-campus recruiting 
and hosting recruits 
on official or unofficial 

campus visits during the time period.
“Today, we took the unprecedented 
and proactive decision to suspend 
intercollegiate activities to protect 

the health and well-being of our 
student-athletes, staff and community 
members,” 
Michigan 
athletic 
director Warde Manuel said in a

statement. “This decision, reached 
in collaboration with the Big Ten 
Conference and campus leaders, was 
reached after thorough discussion 
and 
was 
necessary 
given the magnitude of 
this global issue.
“The 
hard 
work 
and 
dedication 
of 
our 
student-athletes, 
coaches and staff is a 
source of inspiration 
for so many. So, too, 
will be our response 
as we confront the 
spread of this global 
pandemic. On behalf of 
our entire department, 
I thank the Big Ten 
Conference, presidents 
and athletic directors, 
our head coaches and 
community 
partners 
who 
have 
offered 
input and unwavering 
support.”
For the Wolverines, 
the cancellation brings 
an abrupt end to a time 

of year brimming with promise. 
During the first few weeks of the 
spring season, Michigan established 
itself 
as 
a 
national 
contender 
in baseball, softball, tennis and 
gymnastics, among other sports.
For 
basketball 
in 
particular, 
cancellations 
snowballed 
quickly. 
Shortly after the Big Ten cancelled 
its men’s basketball tournament, a 
mass cancellation of other conference 
tournaments ensued. Among the 
leaders of the movement was Duke 
athletic director Kevin White, who 
made waves by suspending all Blue 
Devil 
teams 
from 
competition 
indefinitely. As the chair of the NCAA 
Men’s Basketball Committee, White’s 
decision was the writing on the wall 
for national-level cancellations.
“Some things are bigger than 
basketball,” Wolverines’ coach Juwan 
Howard said in a statement. “This 
is a global situation and we need to 
make sure we follow the guidance and 
direction of the experts and health 
officials. … We want everyone to stay 
safe and take precautions to protect 
yourselves and loved ones.”

Michigan clinches first National Championship title in school history

SAMI RUUD
2021 Daily Sports Writer

The 2021 gymnastics National 
Championship came down to the 
very last routine of the meet. Junior 
Abby Heiskell stared down the beam 
as she mounted it. As she performed 
her routine, she completed each skill 
with an intention to do it perfectly, a 
lesson Michigan coach Bev Plocki has 
drilled into the mind of her gymnasts 
all season. Heiskell showed no ounce 
of doubt in any of her skills, and when 
she finished the routine with a stuck 
dismount, she proved that she was 
capable of being there for her team in 
the moment it needed it most.
Heiskell, joined by her teammates, 
could not peel her eyes from the 
scoreboard, 
and 
neither 
could 
Oklahoma. Waiting for only junior 
Olivia Trautman’s score on floor and 
Heiskell’s score on beam, the teams 
sat tied at 198.0750.
When the number came in on 
the scoreboard, a 9.9250, the team, 
the coaches and the fans erupted. 

Michigan would be the 2021 National 
Champion, 
the 
first 
Michigan 
women’s gymnastics team to ever 
win a National Championship.
“We’ve talked about this for so 
long, and we were like, ‘Oh my gosh, 
this is actually happening. Oh my 
gosh, the meet is over, and we’re 
national champions,’ ” sophomore 
Sierra Brooks said. “So much went 
into this, it’s so amazing seeing our 
hard work pay off.”
Michigan clinched the win, in the 
end, by securing the lead they held 
onto the entire meet. Coming into 
the Finals, Oklahoma was ranked 
first and Michigan second, based on 
the semifinal scores, but the Sooners 
were never given a chance to shine. 
Michigan started the meet on floor 
with six strong routines, all counted 
scores at a 9.9125 or higher. Junior 
Natalie Wojcik led the pack, scoring 
a 9.9500, landing all of her tumbling 
passes smoothly and without fault. 
Sophomore Gabby Wilson also posted 
an impressive score of 9.9375, and the 
solid performance from the rest of her 
teammates landed the Wolverines at 

a 49.6250.
Michigan carried that energy 
to the vault for the second rotation, 
where it extended its lead over the 
rest of the field even further, gaining 
a 0.1375 lead over Oklahoma at the 
halfway mark.
“(Vault’s) just been amazing,” 

LEGAL NOTICE

888-964-2138

A proposed settlement has been reached in a class 
action lawsuit entitled Graham v. University of 
Michigan, et al., Case No. 2:21-cv-11168-VAR-EAS 
 
(E.D. Mich.) (the “Settlement”). Class Members 
must decide now if they want to do nothing, 
object to this Settlement, and/or attend the Final 
 
Approval Hearing.

What is this about? Plaintiff Josephine Graham 
filed this lawsuit alleging that the University of 
Michigan and the Regents of The University 
of Michigan (“Defendants”) do not maintain or 
properly enforce sufficient policies and procedures 
for preventing and responding to sexual misconduct 
on campus. Defendants do not admit any liability, 
fault, or violation of law and deny all allegations 
and claims filed against them. The Court has not 
decided who is right or wrong. Instead, Plaintiff and 
Defendants have agreed to a Settlement to avoid the 
risks, burdens, and expense of continued litigation.

This 
is 
not 
a 
settlement 
about 
money 
compensation. The Settlement is for non-
economic relief. Defendants are incorporating 
practice changes only, and no Class Members will 
receive any money or release any claims they may 
have for money.

Who is affected? If you are currently a student at 
the University of Michigan, you are a Class Member.

What does the Settlement provide? Defendants 
have agreed to implement additional operating and 
oversight procedures for identification, prevention, 
and reporting of improper sexual conduct at 
the University of Michigan (the “University”). 
The University will establish a Coordinated 
Community Response Team (“CCRT”), which 
will have the authority and the duty to assess, 
plan, monitor, and evaluate campus prevention 
and response efforts at the University of Michigan, 
and make official recommendations regarding 
the University’s sexual misconduct prevention 
and response efforts. The CCRT will meet as 
needed throughout the year, but no less than once 
a semester during the academic year, and once 
during the summer.

The CCRT’s Co-Chairs will regularly communicate 
regarding policy, procedure, and practice changes 
to the President of the University and meet with the 
President to discuss the CCRT’s ongoing efforts. In 
addition, the CCRT will regularly provide public 
updates online concerning what it is doing, what 
it has found, and its recommendations regarding 
policy, procedure, and practice changes.

The University will seek an appropriate budget for 
the CCRT, which will, at minimum, cover the cost 
of the External Co-Chair and a $10,000 annual 
discretionary fund. The University will also seek 
other appropriate support for the CCRT. 

The University will cooperate reasonably with 
the CCRT’s requests for information to assist 
with its efforts.

This agreement will continue for five years from 
the date of Court approval. More details about the 
settlement benefits and the CCRT can be found at 
www.UMStudentClassSettlement.com. 

What are my options? As a Class Member, 
you 
may 
do 
nothing 
or 
object 
to 
the 
Settlement. Objecting is telling the Court 
what you do not like about the Settlement. 
 
Go to www.UMStudentClassSettlement.com for 
details on how to object. All objections must be 
postmarked by June 27, 2022. 

What happens next? The Court will hold a Final

At the hearing, the Court will determine whether 
the proposed Settlement is fair, reasonable, and 
adequate and in the best interests of the Class. The 
Court will also rule on applications for attorneys’ 
fees and expenses for Class Counsel (not to 
exceed $5,000,000) and a service award for the 
Class Representative ($2,500). The Court will also 
hear any objections and arguments concerning the 
fairness of the proposed Settlement. You are not 
required to attend the Final Approval Hearing. If 
you or your own lawyer want to speak at the Final 
Approval Hearing, you must send your “Notice of 
Intent to Appear” no later than June 27, 2022.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE COURT 
REGARDING THIS NOTICE

If you are currently enrolled as a student at the 
University of Michigan, your rights are affected by a 
class action settlement

A federal court authorized this notice. This is not a solicitation from a lawyer.

Michigan coach Bev Plocki said. “At 
the beginning of the year, we were 
doing big vaults, but we couldn’t get 
the landings, and it was a process. 
We absolutely peaked at the right 
time this year. … Right before the 
championship part of the season, we 
started being able to nail those 1.5s.”

Heiskell started off Michigan’s 
next rotation on bars with a stuck 
dismount. The Wolverines’ top scores 
of the rotation came from Brooks 
and junior Abby Brenner in her first 
competitive routine in months since 
hurting her ankle at the Big Five meet 
on Feb. 27, and Michigan maintained 
its lead.
That lead, though, was deceptively 
large. The Wolverines had to move 
to the beam, a nerve-racking event to 
conclude a meet on, while the Sooners 
ended on floor, whose scores were the 
highest of any event throughout the 
whole meet.
“I just said to them: ‘Take a deep 
breath, exhale out all of the nervous 
energy and let’s just go do what we do, 
one routine at a time for six routines,’ ” 
Plocki said “We got this, breath in the 
confidence, be aggressive. That’s what 
we wanted them to do, was just go do 
confident, aggressive balance beam.”
Michigan’s beam rotation did not 
start as strong as it would have liked, 
but Brooks turned the rotation around 
for the Wolverines. 
“Before I even went, I was on the 

verge of tears because I wanted it so 
bad for this team,” Brooks said. “I 
knew those routines were semi off, 
but I also trusted myself and the rest 
of the lineup, so I wanted to get out 
there and do my thing. I got on the 
beam and I just honestly approached 
it with as much confidence as I could 
ever have.”
Brooks performed her beam series 
perfectly, making up for some of the 
points her former teammates had 
lost, but Wojcik and Heiskell still had 
to nail their routines for Michigan to 
have a shot at the win.
Wojcik one-upped her teammate, 
sticking every skill just as solidly and 
scoring a 9.9875, the highest beam 
score of the day, then Heiskell handled 
the pressure of a tied score with ease.
“It’s very hard to describe how it 
feels,” Plocki said. “This is 32 years 
I’ve been waiting for this feeling … 
It’s just an unbelievable pride and 
just an admiration for what our team 
has been through and the sacrifices 
that they’ve made. I knew this was 
possible because, for the first time, 
they have belief in themselves.”

Michigan escapes Sweet Sixteen with win over South Dakota, 52-49

ABBIE TELGENHOF
2022 Assistant Sports Editor

WICHITA, KAN. — The Michigan 
women’s basketball team knew it was 
do or die.
With a trip to the Elite Eight on the 
line — potentially the first in program 
history — the third seeded Wolverines 
(25-6 overall) rose to the challenge. 
Taking down No. 11-seed South 
Dakota (29-6), 52-49, in the Sweet 
Sixteen, the Wolverines once again 
made history.
“The moment we had today is 
never going to go away,” Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico said. “So 
I’m just so happy for this group. … 
We’re still playing. There are eight 
darn teams left in the country playing 
and we are one of them. That’s pretty 
incredible.”
From the opening tip, it was a gritty, 
back and forth game. Throughout the 

entire game Michigan struggled to 
score, never truly finding an offensive 
groove. Instead, short spurts of 
efficient scoring kept the Wolverines 
afloat against a physical Coyote 
defense.
In the first quarter, sloppy 
turnovers plagued Michigan. The 
Wolverines looked to their one-two 
punch of senior forward Naz Hillmon 
and senior guard Leigha Brown, but 
to no avail. 
Hillmon — who was triple-teamed 
on every possession — notched zero 
points in the first quarter and just six 
in the second. Brown fared slightly 
better, but any limited success she had 
was unsustainable. Working deep 
into the rotation early, Michigan tried 
to get something going. A short run at 
the end of the first quarter kept the 
Wolverines from fully breaking.
But opening the second quarter 
with two missed 3-pointers from 
junior guard Maddie Nolan and 

a shot-clock violation, Michigan 
quickly fell out of what little rhythm 
it had gained. Short offensive spurts 
from freshman guard Laila Phelia 
kept the Wolverines in the game — 
and a strong defensive showing forced 
South Dakota into tough shots — but 
nothing seemed to stick. 
It quickly became clear Michigan 
wouldn’t magically overcome its 
struggles, but would have to fight 
for every possession. On this night, 
nothing would come easy.
With their offense faltering, the 
Wolverines dug into their defensive 
identity, trying to keep South Dakota 
contained 
on 
offense. 
Clogging 
the paint and hedging high on ball 
screens, Michigan tried to disrupt the 
Coyotes offensive game plan. 
“We play a different style than a 
lot of the teams that (South Dakota) 
played,” Barnes Arico said. “Just going 
back and watching the film of their 
first two tournament games, who they 

beat, two Power Five opponents that 
are awesome teams, they defended it 
differently than we did tonight. We 
wanted to give them a different look. I 
think it sped them up and made them 
take quicker shots than maybe they 
wanted to take.”
Yet, South Dakota still jumped out 
to an early lead. Failing to put together 
a complete game, the Wolverines 
allowed the Coyotes to hang around 
throughout the half, entering the 
locker room down by two points.
Despite 
obvious 
halftime 
adjustments, 
the 
third 
quarter 
followed the same narrative of 
offensive struggle. Doubling down on 
finding Hillmon and senior forward 
Emily Kiser in the paint, Michigan 
finally found the shots it wanted — but 
failed to capitalize.
The Coyotes continued to force the 
Wolverines out of rotation and score 
at every level. Draining 3-pointers and 
finding their forwards inside, South 

Dakota kept Michigan from gaining 
any momentum. With the game very 
much within reach for either team 
throughout the entirety of the fourth 
quarter, 
Michigan 
continued 
to 
struggle finding offensive consistency.
Coming down to the 
final play, the Coyotes 
had a chance to secure 
the lead with 20 seconds 
left on the clock. South 
Dakota 
launched 
an 
open 3-pointer for the 
lead — only for the ball to 
bounce off the rim into 
Hillmon’s hands, with 
a foul following. The 
next possession, another 
Coyote foul sent Brown 
to the line for the first 
time all night. Draining 
both, Brown put the 
Wolverines 
back 
in 
control with a four point 
lead.

Michigan would hold on, emerging 
victorious.
And for the first time in program 
history, with just eight teams left 
vying for a national championship, the 
Wolverines are still dancing.

Michigan shocks Ohio State, ends 
eight-game losing streak in The Game

JARED GREENSPAN
2022 Managing Sports Editor

For 3,653 days — long, arduous, 
hollow days — the Michigan football 
program lived in the shadows of its 
unremitting failures against Ohio 
State. 
There won’t be a 3,654th day. At 
long last, that futile streak is over. 
After eight consecutive bitter 
losses 
to 
the 
Buckeyes, 
the 
Wolverines emerged from The 
Game victorious. No. 5 Michigan 
(11-1 overall, 8-1 Big Ten) shocked 
No. 2 Ohio State (10-2, 8-1), 42-27, 
clinching the Big Ten East and 
punching a ticket to next Saturday’s 
Big Ten Championship Game. 
“One of my favorite sayings of 
all time is, ‘When there’s a will, 
there’s a way,’ ” Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh said after the game. 
“And the will was very strong for 
our team.” 
As the fourth quarter wound 
to a close, reality melded with 
imagination. Senior running back 
Hassan Haskins stood in the 
endzone with outstretched arms, 
celebrating 
a 
touchdown 
that 
handed Michigan a 15-point lead 
with 2:17 minutes to play. He blew 
kisses to the crowd, beckoning the 
raucous sea of maize pom poms that 
serenaded him for an electric five 
touchdown performance. 
Pandemonium had officially set 
in. 
When the clock struck double-
zeroes, everyone seemed to forget 
about the freezing cold and the 
endless nightmares from previous 
defeats. Droves of fans plunged 
from the stands and spilled out onto 
the turf, reveling in their newfound 
glory. 
Michigan, champions of the Big 
Ten East. 
“It was a surreal moment,” junior 
quarterback Cade McNamara said. 
“It’s something we’ve dreamed of. 
Every 6 a.m. (practice), that feeling 
is the reason why we do it.”
Saturday offered an opportunity 
for the Wolverines to exorcise 
past demons, escaping the recent 
doldrums and persistent pain of the 
rivalry. A win would vault them into 
the Big Ten Championship Game 
and buoy aspirations of a berth in 

the College Football Playoff, two 
hurdles that the program had yet to 
clear as of the morning, seven years 
into Jim Harbaugh’s tenure. 
But just as toppling the Buckeyes 
began 
to 
feel 
sisyphean, 
the 
Wolverines punched first on an A.J. 
Henning touchdown — and refused 
to relent. 
“It was really like a war out 
there,” senior defensive end Aidan 
Hutchinson, who wreaked havoc on 
Ohio State’s offense with three sacks, 
said. 
In the second quarter, even 
as Ohio State took a brief 10-7 
lead, Michigan proved unfazed, 
embodying its season-long serenity. 
A 13-play, 82-yard touchdown drive 
sent the Wolverines into halftime 
clenching a 14-13 lead. 
In past years, Michigan unraveled 
in similar moments, particularly in 
The Game. On Saturday, the team 
merely grew stronger. 
The second half started to a tee. 
The Wolverines’ defense forced a 
crisp three-and-out, and the offense 
blazed down the field, running the 
ball three times for a total of 81 yards; 
Haskins capped the drive with a 
touchdown. 
They had kicked 
Ohio 
State 
back 
onto its heels, and 
the Buckeyes would 
never recover. 
So hapless were 
the Buckeyes that 
only a brief kerfuffle 
could slow down the 
Wolverines. After a 
scrum triggered an 
unsportsmanlike 
conduct on Ohio 
State’s 
Cameron 
Brown, 
Michigan 
found the endzone 
again. 
Haskins 
bounced 
outside, 
scoring 
for 
the 
third time on the 
day, 
staking 
the 
Wolverines 
to 
a 
stunning 
15-point 
lead. 
The 
result 
incited 
delirium 
and 
momentarily 
broke the Michigan 
Stadium scoreboard 
— an apt microcosm 

for the shock of The Game’s result. 
In the game’s waning minutes, 
when Stroud’s fourth-and-18 heave 
fell shy of a first down, the reality set 
in. Bleachers rattled. The stadium 
shook. Hutchinson and fifth-year 
safety Brad Hawkins shed tears. 
“We 
have 
(a 
sign) 
inside 
Schembechler Hall, ‘What are you 
doing today to beat Ohio State,’ ” 
Hawkins said. “And today, we beat 
them. It’s a blessing.” 
A blessing, perhaps, but certainly 
not a product of luck. 
“Every workout, every practice, 
every game, everything that we put 
into this season — that’s something 
that we kept in the back of our minds 
every single day that we entered 
Schembechler Hall,” McNamara 
said of Ohio State. “We did enough to 
beat them today.” 
After nine years of perpetual 
suffering, Michigan had achieved 
the unthinkable. It’s a game that no 
one will soon forget. 
“We’ve got a lot of hours left 
today,” Harbaugh smirked, allowing 
himself to digest the gravity of the 
moment. “… Celebrating long into the 
night.”
