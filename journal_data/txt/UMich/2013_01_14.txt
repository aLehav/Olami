A female student told Univer-
sity Police she was raped in a
common areain West Quad resi-
dence hall early Sunday morn-
ing by a male subject after they
walked to the University build-
ing together following an off-
campus party.
The suspect was an Asian
male between 5'6" to 5'8" with
short black hair, according to a
crime alert sent around 9 am.
Sunday morning.
University Police spokes-
woman Diane Brown said police
are classifying the incident as
first-degree Criminal Sexual
Conduct. She said it was unclear
whether there were witnesses to
the incident.
Brown said police are cur-
rently not identifying the room
the alleged assault took place.
She added there is no fur-
ther information available on
the suspect as of 1 p.m. Sunday
afternoon.

Trip to include
conference,
meetings with
'U' alumni
By MATTHEW JACKONEN
Daily StaffReporter
Come November, University
President Mary Sue Coleman
will take her fifth international
trip in hopes of promoting the
University's global identity, this

time to India.
In her tenure as president,
Coleman has taken trips to
China, Ghana, South Africa and
Brazil. Each trip was intended
to strengthen ties with the Uni-
versity's alumni in the regions
and to promote the University's
image on the international stage.
According to Mark Tessler,
the University's Vice Provost
for International Affairs, Cole-
man's trip to India will last for
about one week, in which, she
will travel to Mumbai and the
nation's capital, New Delhi.

Tessler explained that India's
importance in the global econ-
omy and investment in higher
education make it an attractive
destination.
"It's quite dynamic and we
have a lot of faculty members
here who have good profes-
sional contacts we can build on,"
Tessler said.
"There's also a major Ameri-
can initiative from the United
States and the Indian govern-
ment ... in cultural exchange and
education," he added.
Coleman spoke late last year

in an interview with The Michi-
gan Daily about the travel deci-
sions.
"We had made the decision...
(by) consulting broadly across
the University with faculty, par-
ticularly where we thought the
best impact could be for me to
go," Coleman said. "That's how
we chose China in the first place,
then we chose Africa, then we
chose Brazil based on those con-
versations."
Coleman focused on the idea
that the trip should be mutually

said.
Outside of West Quad this
afternoon, residents of the dorm
shared their concerns about the
alleged assault.
LSA sophomore Tess Filip
said she was walking back, to
her dorm room at the time of {
the alleged assault. She said
the incident reminded her to
always be aware of her sur-
roundings.

PUBLIC SAFETY
DPSS names
new units after
reorganization

Police, Housing
and Hospital
security renamed
By ARIANA ASSAF
Daily StaffReporter
After months of investigat-
ing flaws in the collaboration
between University security
departments, the University
has taken the final steps in con-
firming its newly configured
Division of Public Safety and
Security.
The University announced
Monday new names for depart-
ments in the Division of Public
Safety and Security, an over-
arching public safety agency
that will now oversee the
formerly distinct University
Police, Housing Security and
Hospital Security units.
DPSS now comprises four
departments: the University of
Michigan Police Department,
formerly the Department of
Public Safety; Hospitals and
Health Centers Security Ser-
vices, formerly Hospital Secu-
rity; and Housing Security
and Safety Services, formerly
Housing Security; and Univer-
sity Security Services, which
includes the office of Emer-
gency Preparedness, Security
Systems and Technology Man-
agement, Art Museum security,

Kelsey Museum security and
contracted security.
Now the four department
directors all report to the exec-
utive DPSS director, who is
interim director Joe Piersante.
Calls for such an agency
came after a report that child
pornography was found on a
University Hospital computer
was reported to University
Police six months after the inci-
dent was reported to Hospital
Security.
Later in April 2012, Univer-
sity-President Mary Sue Cole-
man and the University's Board
of Regents hired security con-
sulting firm Margolis Healy
& Associates for an external
review of the communication
issues that took place between
the University Police and Hos-
pital Security.
The report, released by the
firm- in October, exposed a lack
of cooperation and communica-
tion among the former Depart-
ment of Public Safety, Housing
Security and Hospital Security.
Margolis Healy & Associates
suggested reorganization of
University security forces fol-
lowing miscommunication that
prolonged reporting of the case.
Piersante, who also acts as
the University Police chief, said
in a statement that the name
changes should make clear the
missions of the DPSS units.

Multiple fire
departments called
to apartment
complex
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily StaffReporter
Six people were taken to Uni-
versity Hospital Sunday evening
after flames engulfed multiple
units of an apartment complex at
1310 Packard Street.
The six were in stable condi-
tion when they were transported
to the hospital via two ambu-
lances, Huron Valley Ambulance
spokeswoman Joyce Williams
said. The fire appeared to have
destroyed several apartments
and left the building inhabitable,

according to fire officials.
At 9:06 p.m., the Ann Arbor
Fire Department received a
report of a structure fire con-
taining trapped residents, Ann
Arbor Fire Chief Chuck Hubbard
said in an interview at the scene.
Due to the extent of the blaze,
all fire personnel in Ann Arbor
responded to the call, as well as
units from Pittsfield Township,
Ypsilanti Township and the city
of Ypsilanti. -
Hubbard said flames covered
the windows on the front end of
the complex as police officers and
firefighters entered the building
to rescue those trapped inside.
"The units went through the
front door with the hose .line,
advanced up, fought through the
fire and got them out," Hubbard
said.
A police officer retrieved one

person, while firefighters found
four people in a back apartment
with towels over their heads,
struggling to breathe. Hubbard
said all rescues were made from
the top floor of the eight-unit
complex, and those transported
tothehospitalwerebeingtreated
for smoke inhalation. In addi-
tion, three police officers were
treated for smoke inhalation. He
was unable to confirm if victims
of the fire were University stu-
dents.
Rackham graduate students
Gabe Frieden and Leigh Korey
were, two of the people rescued
from one of the apartment's back
units on the second floor. The
two smelled smoke and at first
suspected a nearby campfire.

East LiberySre
Ye.It's as Intense as you exect.

New businesses
bring life to
previously vacant
storefronts
By STEPANIE DILWORTH
Daily Staff Reporter
East Liberty Street has two
new, tasty additions only one block
apart: Asian restaurant Kuroshio
and Mexican restaurant tsalita.
Kuroshio, an Asian fusion res-
taurant named after the Ruru-
shio Current off the coast of
Taiwan, is owned by University
alum Alan Wang and his par-
ents, Kenneth Wang and Grace
Chen. tt was built in place of the
former Champion Mouse restau-
rant, which closed last year.
Wang said he drew inspi-
ration from other, acclaimed
Asian restaurants when he
designed Kuroshio, and wants
to offer customers a unique
dining experience. Upon enter-
ing the restaurant, customers
are greeted by themes of water
currents such as a wall foun-
tain, textured wave walls and
tranquil background music.
"I was looking at a lot of fine
dining in Asian restaurants in
East Asia, and a lot of it had
a very simple, minimalistic
design," Wang said. "I was
really drawn to that design and
used it as my inspiration."
Wang said Kuroshio is more
of a special-events place.
The majority of Kuroshio's
food has Japanese influences
in addition to a blend of Kore-
an, Thai and American food.
The restaurant specializes in
seafood, sashimi, or raw, sushi-
grade fish; and sushi.
Wang and Kuroshio's chef,
Venice Lee, said they wanted
to serve mostly Japanese food'

because the cuisine is inher-
ently healthy. In addition, Lee
is most familiar with Japanese
food after undergoing training
with a Japanese chef in Hong
Kong when he was 14 years old.
Head server Gil Tabon said
his favorite aspects of working
at Kuroshio so far are his fellow
staff members and the experi-
ence, as well as the unique dishes
the restaurant offers.
"I love the family orientation
at Kuroshio," Tabon said. "They
really take pride in not only their
food, but who they work with."
Tabon said the quality of ser-
vice is an essential aspect of the
functioning of the restaurant.
"Anticipation is key," he said.
"We always try to anticipate the
guests' needs. You shouldn't have
to ask for more water because it
should aireadybe there."
Kuroshio is currently hiring
and will only be open for din-
ner until it is fully staffed.
Similarly, Isalita will tempo-
rarily only be open for dinner.
Adam Baru, owner of Isalita,
said he decided to. open the
Mexican-themed restaurant
and bar right next door to his
Italian restaurant, Mani Oste-
cia, which opened in 2011.
Baru said the choice of loca-
tion has proven convenient.
"The restaurants being so
close together made this an
easy decision," Baru said. "I
could oversee both restaurants
and my chef Brenden (McCall),
can oversee both as well."
Baru said it was important to
him that the neighboring restau-
rants were varied. While Mani
Osteria is designed with earth
tones and a rustic look, Isalita
is made up of wooden elements
and offers bursts of colors. It also
showcases copper aspects and
has personal touches.
"I wanted it very much to be
two different dining experienc-

es," Baru said. "I want (Isalita)
to feel more vibrant, like Mexico;
a go there every year with my
family. It's not just about bright
colors and cactus, the flaws add
realness to the space. It feels.
youthful and vibrant and even a
little bit more edgy."
Isalita's bartender, Jeff Wes-
terman, said the bar highlights
traditional Mexican drinks and
offers house specialties such
as the "coyacon," which comes
from the word "coyote."
"We've created a whole menu
with our interpretations of Mexi-
can drinks," Westerman said.
"Obviously highlighting tequila
and mezcal, we really wanted to
highlight that on the menu,.it's not
something you'll find around here:'
"(Baru) provides us with a
wonderful working environ-
ment," he added. "He is very
supportive of all of his employ-
ees. He makes sure that this
stays a fun, fresh place to work."
Baru said Chef Brenden
McCall's dishes - such as flau-
tas, tuna tostados, hamachi and
forest mushroom tacos - were
inspired by trips to Mexico. The
restaurant will primarily serve
small plates reminiscent of
Mexican tapas and will always
involve salt, lime and heat.
A customer, Jerry Robins,
said he plans to dine at the res-
taurant in the future.
"It. was a very pleasant expe-
dieuce," Robins said. "The pric-
es are hefty but the service is
good and we enjoyed the food."
Another customer, Kelan
Hlavaty said she had a good
experience at Isalita.
"I would definitely say that*
this is gourmet Mexican food,"
said Hlavaty. "I thought they
could have done a little more
work on the drinks, though. I
thought that they were good,
but for the price they could
have been stiffer."

PARIS
Gay marriage
protest converges
on Eiffel Tower
Holding aloft ancient flags
and young children, hundreds of
thousands of people converged
Sunday on the Eiffel Tower to
protest the French president's
plan to legalize gay marriage and
thus allow same-sex couples to
adopt and conceive children.
The opposition to President
Francois Hollande's plan has
underscored divisions among
the secular-but-Catholic French,
especially more traditional rural
areas versus urban enclaves. But
while polls show the majority of
French still support legalizing
gay marriage, that backing gets
more lukewarm when children
come into play.
The protest march started at
three points across Paris, filling
boulevards throughout the city
as demonstrators walked six kilo-
meters (3 miles) to the grounds of
France's most recognizable mon-
ument.

it has built a ring of Jewish
settlements in the enlarged
eastern sector to cement its
control over the city.
E-1 would be built in the
West Bank just east of Jerusa-
lem, and would close one of the
last options for Palestinians to
create territorial continuity
between Arab neighborhoods
of east Jerusalem, their hoped-
for capital, and the West Bank.
According to building plans,
E-1 would have more than
3,000 apartments.
The Palestinians, say they
turned to the U.N. last Novem-
ber out of frustration with
the deadlock in peace talks.
They believe the internation-
al endorsement of the 1967
lines will bolster their posi-
tion in negotiations. Israel has
accused the Palestinians of
trying to bypass the negotiat-
ing process and impose a solu-
tion.

Councilmembers
against authority
for S.E. Mich.
By MATTHEW JACKONEN
Daily Staff Reporter
Only months after the failure
of the Washtenaw Initiative, a
county-wide transit authority
championed by the Ann Arbor
Transit Authority, Ann Arbor
City Council members are resist-
ing involvement in the South-
eastern Michigan, Regional
Transit Authority.
In the last week of 2012,
Republican Gov. Rick Sny-
der passed legislation for the
creation of the RTA, which
mandates expanded pub-
lic transportation methods
throughout the southeast Michi-
gan area - Macomb, Oakland,
Washtenaw and Wayne coun-
ties. The southeast RTA board
is composed of two representa-
tives from each county and two
additional representatives - one
from Detroit and one chosen by
Snyder.
Within a week, Conan
Smith, chair of the Washtenaw
County Board of Commission-
ers, announced his Washtenaw
County appointments to the
RTA: Elisabeth Gerber, a Uni-
versity professor at the Ford
School of Public Policy, and
Richard Murphy, the program
director for the Michigan Sub-
urbs Alliance.
"Washtenaw County and Ann
Arbor in particular have a real
gem with the AATA," Gerber
said. "One of my top priorities is
to be sure not only to do no harm
to AATA ... certainly being sure
that it is not compromised by the
dynamics of the RTA."
However, Gerber also stated
that the RTA needs commitment
from all counties.
"I feel very strongly that
regional collaboration and
regional governance only works
when everybody wants it," Ger-
ber said.
Murphy, who has a back-
ground in transportation and
land-use planning, said he will
use his position on the board to
introduce rail to the area.
"The big transit need for us
in Washtenaw County is the
Ann Arbor to Detroit commuter
rail line," Murphy said. "We've
been laying the groundwork for
that for a decade, and the RTA

should be the way we finally
bring that project to life, but
the legislation has some weird
provisions discouraging rail-
based transit that we'll have to
navigate."
Murphy added that taking in
factors such as cost and rider-
ship, rail is the right option.
Upon the announcement
of the RTA, many Ann Arbor
City Council members were
vocal about their disinterest
in Ann Arbor and Washtenaw
County's participation. Coon-
cilmember Christopher Tay-
lor (D-Ward 3) was among the
opposed camp.
"The short of it is,I have a tre-
mendous amount of respect for
both appointed board members,
and I believe the RTA has a great
deal of promise for Macomb,
Oakland and Wayne counties,"
Taylor said. "I also believe that
it has no benefit for Washtenaw
County and that Washtenaw
County should be excluded from
it."
Taylor continued to argue
that the RTA is a "poison pill" for
Ann Arbor and the county. One
of the RTA's current proposals is
a bus route from Detroit to Ann
Arbor.
"Public transportation in
Washtenaw County serves
Washtenaw County's needs very
well," Taylor said. "Any new
RTA would focus the lion's share
of its resources and attention to
areas that are most in need ... I
believe that Washtenaw County
would not receive its propor-
tionate due."
Councilmember Sabra Briere
(D-Ward 1) agreed that the ben-
efits of the RTA would apply only
to other counties, and that most
of the proposed services would
be inefficient for residents.
"My own feeling for the RTA
is I have a whole bunch of ques-
tions of the effect of the RTA on
the existing (AATA) bus system,"
Briere said. She questioned "how
many people would take a bus
that is going to take an hour and
a half to come into Ann Arbor for
whatever purpose?"
AATA spokeswoman Mary
Stasiak did not elaborate on the
AATA's position on the RTA but
endorsed the selected Board
representatives.
Stasiak said: "Both of the RTA
Board representatives chosen
have qualifications and experi-
ence that are important in lead-
ing the formation of this new
regional authority."

U.S education secretary advocates
for more breaks, longer school year

Pilot program will
affect students in
four states
(AP) - Did your kids moan
that winter break was way too
short as you got them ready for
the first day back in school?
They might get their wish of
more holiday time off under
proposals catching on around
the country to lengthen the
school year.
But there's a catch: a much
shorter summer vacation.
Education Secretary Arne
Duncan, a chief proponent of
the longer school year, says
American students have fallen
behind the world academically.
"Whether educators have
more time to enrich instruc-
tion or students have more
time to learn how to play an
instrument and write com-
puter code, adding meaning-
ful in-school hours is a critical
investment, that better pre-
pares children to be success-
ful in the 21st century," he said
in December when five states
announced they would add at
least 300 hours to the academ-
ic calendar in some schools
beginning this year.
- The three-year pilot proj-
ect will affect about 20,000
students in 40 schools in
Colorado, Connecticut, Mas-
sachusetts, New York and Ten-
nessee.
Proponents argue that too
much knowledge is lost while
American kids wile away the
summer months apart from
their lessons. The National
Summer Learning Association
cites decades of research that
shows students' test scores are
higher in the same subjects at
the beginning of the summer
than at the end.
"The research is very clear
about that," said Charles
Ballinger, executive director
emeritus of the National Asso-
ciation for Year-Round School
in San Diego. "The only ones
who don't lose are the upper
10 to 15 percent of the student
body. Those tend to be gifted,

college-bound, they're natural
learners who will learn wher-
ever they are."
Supporters also say a longer
school year would give poor
children more access to school-
provided healthy meals.
Yet the movement has plen-
ty of detractors - so many
that Ballinger sometimes feels
like the Grinch trying to steal
Christmas.
"I had a parent at one meet-
ing say, 'I want my child to lie
on his back in the grass watch-
ing the clouds inthe sky during
the day and the moon and stars
at night,"' Ballinger recalled.
"I thought, 'Oh, my. Most kids
do that for two, three, maybe
four days, then say, 'What's
next?"
But opponents aren't simply
dreamy romantics.
Besides the outdoor oppor-
tunities for pent up young-
sters, they say families already
are beholden to the school
calendar for three seasons out
of four. Summer breaks, they
say, are needed to provide an
academic respite for students'
overwrought minds, and to

provide time with family and
the flexibility to travel and
study favorite subjects in more
depth. They note that advo-
cates of year-round school can-
not point to any evidence that
it brings appreciable academic
benefits.
"I do believe that if children
have not mastered a subject
that, within a week, person-
ally, I see a slide in my own
child," said Tina Bruno, execu-
tive director of the Coalition
for a Traditional School Cal-
endar. "That's where the idea
of parental involvement and
parental responsibility in edu-
cation comes in, because our
children cannot and should not
be in school seven days a week,
365 days a year."
Bruno is part of a "Save Our
Summers" alliance of parents,
grandparents, educational
professionals and some sum-
mer-time recreation providers
fighting year-round school.
Local chapters carry names
such as Georgians Need Sum-
mers, Texans for a Traditional
School Year and Save Alabama
Summers.

FROM THE DAILY
Timely transit
Federal funding for railway is a good start
ccording to an analysis by the Brookings Institution, nearly
40 million working-age people live in metropolitan areas in
the United States that lack public transportation. Detroit and
its surrounding area are no exception. The lack of public transporta-
tion has made it difficult for people without cars to travel through-
out the city. Detroit is also inaccessible for individuals who live in
communities bordering Detroit. The federal government is stepping
in to help Michigan's dire transportation system problem. According
to the Detroit News, it's likely that $25 million will be awarded to,
Detroit's light-rail streetcar project. This funding will help Michi-
gan's public transportation system immensely and make traveling to
Detroit a more attractive option.

The light-rail streetcar project is expected
to cost $500 million and will travel up Wood-
ward to 8 Mile Road every 7.5 minutes during
peak travel hours. The car called M-1, hopes to
connect to a four-line regional rapidbus system
that will tie Detroit to surrounding counties.
Less than 10 percent of Detroit residents use
the citywide transportation system. The cur-
rent bus system has been cited as being slow and
unreliable. This light-rail streetcar will make it
more convenient and efficient for residents to
travel to and from work. A more reliable system
will also make Detroit more attractive to peo-
ple looking for jobs in the downtown area with
urban amenities.
In recent years, state and local leaders have
discussed various methods to improve the
transportation system in the city, but plans
have been tabled. Three years ago U.S. officials
agreed to fund M-l, yet Detroit is just receiving
the funding now. Though this funding is a nice
gesture, it's not sufficient to overhaul Detroit's
transportation system. While this demon-
strates the federal government's commitment
to improving Detroit and the entire state of

Michigan, leaders at all levels must act in a
more timely manner. A feasible transportation
plan that can be implemented quickly is crucial
to Detroit's economic recovery.
This funding is the first step to connect-
ing southeastern Michigan. However, for
this transit system to be totally effective it
needs to be more encompassing so that every
county has access to Detroit. Implementing
this transit system throughout Michigan will
encourage citizens to work, visit and live in
the downtown Detroit area. Increasing access
to Detroit will also encourage new businesses
and their future employees to live and spend
time there, helping the city's suffering econo-
my. But this will only be possible if the public
transit system is extended.
It's clear that Michigan is ina state of transi-
tion. A large part of the success of this transi-
tion will involve connecting Detroit to the rest
of the state. The light-rail streetcar project is
one method of making this a reality, though
more effort and money is needed to make public
transportation a useful service to Detroit and
Michigan residents.

n Dec. 14,I received three
text messages from my
mom. The first simply said,
"S love you." The
second asked
me, "Why did
he have to kill
20 babies?" and
the third read,s
"Please write
about this."
The first col- JAMES
umn Iever wrote BRENNAN
for the Daily was
an indictment
of our country's
failure to have a meaningful debate
about guns. In it, I said that if we
do not have this conversation, then
another mass shooting would hap-
pen within nine months. It only took
three, and now 20 children lie dead
for absolutely no good reason.
That's the worst part about all of
these deaths - they have no pur-
pose. Someone simply snaps and
decides to go on a killing spree.
There has been massive specula-
tion as to the mental state of Adam
Lanza, the Newtown shooter, but I
can answer that question without
looking at his medical history or
making any investigation. The guy
went to an elementary school and
gunned down more than two dozen
people, most of whom were six- and
seven-year-old children. Clearly, he
was mentally unstable.
Three years ago, I had an emo-
tional breakdown and spent four
days in a psychiatric hospital. I
had to be admitted because I was
considered to be a major threat to
my own safety. I needed proper
treatment and constant ,observa-
tion. I was put on anti-depressants
and have spent countless hours in

therapy since, figuring out why I
feel the way I do and how to keep
my less rational side at bay. I can
confidently say that I've gotten a lot
better, but when it comes to mental
illness, you really never know if sta-
bility will last.
Despite demonstrated, docu-
mented potential for self-harm, I
face no additional barriers to pur-
chasing a gun. If1I wanted a hand-
gun, I would have to registerand
obtain a permit, all without any
investigation into my mental health
history. It would be even easier to
obtain a rifle or shotgun. IfS was so
inclined, I could drive to my local
gun shop right now, pass a quick
criminal-background check and
walk out the same day with a rifle.
During my stay in the hospital,
we spent a lot of time in group ther-
apy discussing our problems. There
were other young men much more
depressed than I - guys who had
attempted suicide and failed. Some
of them had tried with guns. Worse
yet were the kids who weren't just
a threat to themselves, but to those
around them. They were angry
and had a history of violence. I
was afraid of them despite being
in a hospital under near-constant
surveillance. Imagining that some
of these kids are out in the world
today and legally old enough to buy
guns makes me even more afraid.
Mentally stable people do not
walk into schools and gun down
children. Nor do they open fire on
a crowded movie theater or walk
around a college campus shooting
students. Someone with a history
of a potentially dangerous mental
illness should not be allowed any-
where near a gun, this is just com-
mon sense.

So why am I even writing about
this right now? Why is it that I live
in a country where there is even a
debate about mental stability play-
ing a role in whether or not some-
one can purchase a gun? Better yet,
as I asked in my first column, why
am I living in a country where we
have to debate whether or not to
take any action when it comes to
gun violence? Why does it take the
deaths of children to get our presi-
dent to publicly support a ban on
military grade weaponry for citi-
zens?
We need to accept
the fact that guns
lead to tragedy.
I'll be blunt: It's because our
country is brainwashed. The gun
lobby owns Congress, but they also
own public perception. We see guns
as forms of protection rather than
tools of mass death. We take seri-
ously the media's glorification of
shooting people. On top of that, our
idea of freedom has been skewed
to include owning high-powered
weapons designed for the sole pur-
pose of killing people. The rest of
the world doesn't have this prob-
lem. The rest of the world hasn't
been coerced by fear and lies. The
rest of the world accepts the con-
cept that guns lead to tragedy. We
need to do the same.

Benefits from Medicaid

(Dis) honor code

Expanding Medicaid benefits not only helps
the uninsured, but also benefits individuals
with private health insurance, hospitals and
the state economy. The Affordable Care Act,
put into place by President Barack Obama,
gives states the opportunity to expand Medic-
aid eligibility to cover all non-elderly citizens
and eligible immigrants. Michigan Gov. Rick
Snyder has the power and obligation to decide
whether Michigan should participate in Med-
icaid expansion. Now is the time for Snyder to
decide that Michigan will take advantage of
this valuable opportunity.
Medicaid expansion benefits Michigan's
economy. The Affordable Care Act provides
that the federal government will pay for 100
percent of the cost of Medicaid expansion
between 2014 and 2017, ultimately paying
for 90 percent of the cost in the following
years. Analysts at the Center for Healthcare
Research and Transformation project that
Michigan can reap up to $1 billion in savings
in the next 10 years due to this expansion.
Medicaid expansion is also projected to bring
more than $30 billion into Michigan's econo-
my between 2014 and 2023.
Medicaid expansion benefits those who
need health insurance. According to the Cen-
ter for Budget and Policy Priorities, there.are
about 676,000 uninsured Michigan citizens
who would be eligible for Medicaid if Michi-
gan chooses to participate in the program.
Medicaid expansion will give these uninsured
people a chance to access health care services

that will improve their health and well-being.
Medicaid expansion benefits employers
and individuals with private health insurance.
If you're an employer or individual who pur-
chases private health insurance, part of your
costs come from uncompensated care that hos-
pitals provide to the uninsured by law. If we
reduce the number of uninsured, we reduce
the amount of uncompensated care expenses
that get passed onto those with private health
insurance. The Center for Healthcare Research
and Transformation projects statewide savings
between $640 and $985 million over the next 10
years for those who purchase health insurance
because of Medicaid expansion.
Medicaid expansion benefits hospitals.
Currently, hospitals that treat a lot of unin-
sured patients receive extra compensation
known as disproportionate share payments.
The federal government will reduce pay-
ments to hospitals across the nation between
2014 and 2020 because it expects fewer peo-
ple will be uninsured. If we fail to expand
Medicaid, Michigan hospitals will most like-
ly be in a nasty bind - their payments will
go down and they may face an increase in
uncompensated care expenses.
Snyder believes that "to build a stronger
Michigan, we must build a healthier Michi-
gan." I agree wholeheartedly. Let's get start-
ed by expanding Medicaid and participating
in this valuable project.

J have neither given nor
received unauthorized
aid on this examina-
tion, nor have I
concealed any
violations of the
Honor Code."
I scan my
eyes over the
familiar pledge
on the front
page of my engi-
neering exam, HEMA
quickly sign my KARUNA-
name beneath it KARAM
and wait for the
instructor to give
us the signal to begin. Students in
front of me are doing the same thing
while the remainder of the exams
are passed out behind us. A few seats
down from me, however, Ihear more
noise than I'd expect a pen scribbling
on paper to make. One of my fellow
students - after signing the Honor
Pledge - is flipping through the
pages of the exam, sneakily checking
out the questions before the exam
has officially begun.
Under the College of Engineer-
ing's honor code, our exams may
not be proctored. Because of this,
we're all aware that the instruc-
tor will step out of the room as
soon as we're told to start. At that
point, we are expected to uphold
the honor code and not cheat on the
exam, although the opportunity
may exist. But what about this stu-
dent who now has prior knowledge
of the exam questions - even if by
only a few minutes? Is this an honor
code violation? And if so, am I sup-
posed to do something about it?
The College of Engineering has
a concise but, serious honor code to
,which all of its students and faculty
are held. While its effectiveness is
debatable, every student has the
opportunity to bring a case before
the Honor Council, and is essentially
assured a "fair trial" on any aca-
demic dispute. On the other hand,
LSA does not have a formal honor
code and much discretion is left to
the instructor when academic integ-
rity violations are of concern. In fact,

according to the faculty guidelines at
the Newnan LSA Academic Advising
Center, in cases of academic miscon-
duct "the course grade is your deci-
sion" regardless of the outcome.
With such a loose structure open
to interpretation, it's no wonder
so many of my LSA friends have
reported that cheating runs rampant
in several of their classes. But in my
experience they aren't the only ones
observing - or partaking in - cheat-
ing. Across almost every University
school, academic integrity seems to
stand out as a hot-button issue. So
why has the University done relative-
ly little to battle it?
I'm sure that somewhere over the
past few semesters I, too, have violat-
ed the College of Engineering Honor
Code or the LSA Academic Integ-
rity standards. I've bent the rules
on "collaborations" a few times on
projects and homework assignments
in the past, and have even concealed
minor grading errors on exams when
they've been in my favor. Despite
this, I've never knowinglycheated on
an exam or taken credit for work that
was entirely someone else's. Perhaps
we all have a different point at which
we draw the line when it comes to
upholding moral standards - in fact,
we've all grown up with different
moral standards.
So is it of greater importance that
morals with regard to academic
integrity be preached more seri-
ously and frequently to students? Or
should the focus be on letting stu-
dents know what they can do if they
feel they have not been given a fair
opportunity to succeed in class?
While the proactive approach may
be easier for the University, its effec-
tiveness is doubtful. Most academic
units, including LSA, don't have any
framework in place for formally tell-
ing students about academic integ-
rity - the standards are just implicit
on all assignments and exams. But
all engineering students sit through
a lecture on the Honor Code their
freshman year during Engineering
100, though most have probably long
forgotten it.
But knowing that the College of

Engineering has an Honor Code at
all has made me feel a little safer dur-
ing assignments and exams - pro-
vided there was something I could do
about violations I saw or heard about.
I've observed students copying each
other's answers verbatimon problem
sets. I've sat through engineering
exams that were, in fact, proctored.
And I've silently looked on as class-
mates have flipped through exams
before they were supposed to. In
each case I've felt helpless. Instead
of feeling proud for not violating any-
thing myself, I've silently wondered
if watching violations take place is
just as bad as being the snitch to tell.
Would it matter at the end of the day
when I had earned my grades fairly,
even if they were lower than those of
the violators?
A 'fair trial' is
essential when it
comes to incidents
of cheating.
A few semesters from now, I
would like to graduate from the
University knowing that I worked
hard for my degree and that I truly
earned it for myself. Perhaps I
shouldn't be concerned whether or
not those around me share that sen-
timent or even acknowledge it. But
a University of Michigan degree
is respected around the world for
a reason. The University should
make a greater effort across all aca-
demic schools to make sure that
students do not feel compromised
during exams, projects or anything
else that has a large impact on their
grades. As students, next time we
see an opportunity to cheat, we
should be asking ourselves wheth-
er, in a few years, we'd be proud of
a degree that was earned unfairly.

Other students shared con-

"The fact that women can be
assaulted in public, in public safe
areas is crazy," Saraff said.
LSA freshman Alyssa Laten
said she would intervene if she
noticed any suspicious behav-

noted that sometimes it can be
hard to tell whether students are

assume they were good friends
and they were fine," Laten said.
"If the other person was very

"We expect the revised names
to help the University communi-
ty better recognize the roles and
responsibilities of the women
and men in these departments,"
Piersante said.
The Margolis Healy report
noted that individuals did not
often know whether they were
talking to a security officer or a
police officer.
All DPSS departments report
to the executive director, who
then reports to Coleman. Pier-
sante is acting as the inter-
im executive director until a
national search for a permanent
replacement is completed. He
has already met with the search
committee, and said the job post-
ing for the position should be
released bythe end of the month.
Piersante said in this tran-
sition, DPSS has focused on
improving communication
between the departments.
"Our transition to a new

division has been progressing
as we work with our campus
colleagues to accomplish the.
behind-the-scenes work such
as creating budgets and moving
employees from auxiliary units
into a campus division, while
we continue to fulfill our daily
services to the University com-
munity," Piersante said.
Security department direc-
tors will now attend the weekly
meetings to discuss major events
and trends in crime. Similar
meetings were previously held by
UMPD. Additionally, the former
DPS database, known as "Secu-
rity Center," is now available to
all DPSS employees. The Margo-
lis Healy report mentioned that a
lack of universal access to a data-
base was a problem.
Piersante said DPSS has
already seen positive change.
"A lot of work was done to
unify all separate security ele-
ments on campus," Piersante
said. "Communication has abso-
lutely improved."

"We are taking full advantage
of these trips to try to make our-
selves more accessible to these
countries, as well as to have more
impact."
Tessler mentioned further
goals for the trip.
"We're exploring some inter-
esting opportunities for some
new educational exchange study
abroad programs, collaborative
research, for our faculty mem-
bers and collaboration between
some of the units on campus like
the school of medicine or LSA
or any of the schools (and their
Indian counterparts)," Tessler
said.
Tessler also noted that the
University is "very eager" to
maintain and develop contact
with the alumni in India who
are "tremendous sources of sup-
port."
Jo Rumsey, vice president for
International Alumni Relations
at the University of Michigan
Alumni Association, said the
alumni in India have been large-
ly self-motivated.
"They have a lot of MBA grad-
uates, and now BBA graduates,
who are generally visible people
in their communities," Rumsey
said. "They take the initiative.
They get out there ahead of oth-
ers. India's alumni - for almost
as long as I've been here - have

been pretty active in wanting to
stay in touch with the Univer-
sity."
The University's alumni base
in India has an effective lead-
ership structure that is broken
down into regions, so the associ-
ation can maintain efficient con-
tact with the separate regions.
Rumsey said India's alumni
are more organized than that of
many other countries.
"They've been on the ground
for a longtime and were probably
ahead of most ;other countries,
frankly," Rumsey said.
Rumsey also said it was the
persistence of C. K. Prahalad -
a former professor at the Busi-
ness School from the 1970s until
his death in 2010-that fostered
a relationship between the Uni-
versity and India that led to
many of the programs in India.
One of these programs is the
University of Michigan India
Business Conference that was
started three years ago and is on
the itinerary for Coleman's trip.
"I have not seen anything like
this anywhere else in the world,"
Rumsey said of the conference.
"I'm hoping President Coleman
will be ablej o participate in it as
part of her travel and that cer-
tainly we can bring more alumni
together around that function."
Brodie Remington, the direc-

tor of development and inter-
national giving for the Office of
Development at the University,
spoke at length about what type
of relationship the University
maintains with India.
"The University of Michigan
is an extraordinary place with
relationships. Academic rela-
tionships, research interest rela-
tionships, faculty relationships,
and student recruiting relation-
ships," Remington said. "In a
place like India, we have all of
those things."
Of these relationships, Rem-
ington noted that there are mul-
tiple exchange programs and
shared research projects that
provide benefits to India and the
University at almost any level or
college within the University.
Remington noted that law
schools and health systems n
particular have been beneficial
to both sides.
Coleman said the University
does a comparatively good job
in promoting and strategically
planning these international
trips when measured against
other universities across the
country.
"In my experience, Michi-
gan plans these more carefully
and more strategically than
any other university I've been
involved with."

- and attracted only 50 people.
Mochitsuki has now grown
into one of the largest Japanese
cultural festivals in Michigan,
Ozanich said. She added the
activities in Mochitsuki repre-
sent aspects of Japanese culture
and community that the CJS
staff considered important.
"We met in a group and talk-
ed about what kinds of things
would represent the communi-
ties in Japan and that's how we
came up with games, for exam-
ple, and other (activities)," Oza-
nich said.
Miyabi, a band comprised of
three Japanese string instru-
ments, a piano and a flute played
popular American and Japanese
music such as "Take Five" and
"My Neighbor Totoro" for the
first half of the event. It was fol-
lowed by Raion Taiko, a drum-
ming ensemble.
Besides mochi-making and
live music, the event also incor-
porated several other stations,
including a yukata kimono
dressing station.
Nick Oliverio, Ann Arbor
resident and volunteer, said his
favorite part about the event
was seeing how much fun every-

one had.
"When everybody gets to
dress up, it really lets them be
a part of the experience, and I
think that that's really some-
thing special for them," Oliverio
said.
The event also featured tra-
ditional Japanese games, such
as Mahjong and Karuta; a
showcase of University Japa-
nese language students' works;
and children's storytelling per-
formed by Ichiro Kataoka, one
of the top professional benshi in
Japan. Benshi refers to a silent
film narrator.
LSA sophomore Annicia
McFadden said she had heard
about the event in her Japanese
class and decided to attend.
"I think that it's interesting
that they have basically cultural
influences from all over Japan.
In one room they have people
playing music and here we have
people making mochi," said
McFadden.
LSA sophomore Mackenzie
Ellsberry, secretary of the Japa-
nese Student Association, was
pleased with the event.
"It is nice to see new faces,"
Ellsberry said. "Out of all the
Japanese events on campus, this
one is definitely biggest. So it is
nice to see all these people come
out and just enjoy Japanese cul-
ture."

Egypt's Mubarak to get new trial
over killings during revolution

Court overturns
former Egyptian
president's life
sentence
CAIRO (AP) - An Egyptian
appeals court on Sunday over-
turned Hosni Mubarak's life
sentence and ordered a retrial
of the ousted leader in the kill-
ing of hundreds of protesters, a
ruling likely to further unsettle
a nation still reeling from politi-
cal turmoil and complicate the
struggle of his Islamist succes-
sor to assert his authority.
The court's decision put the
spotlight back on the highly
divisive issue of justice for
Mubarak and his top security
officers, who were also ordered
retried, two years after the revo-
lution that toppled him.
The ruling poses a distraction
for President Mohammed Morsi
as he tries to restore law and
order, grapple with a wrecked
economy and deal with the

aftermath of the worst political
crisis since Mubarak's ouster.
A new trial is virtually cer-
tain to dominate national head-
lines, attracting attention away
from a crucial election for a new
house of deputies roughly three
months from now. Morsi and his
Islamist allies are determined
to win a comfortable majority
in the new chamber, allowing
them to take the helm of the
most populous Arab nation.
The ailing 84-year-old
Mubarak is currently being held
in a military hospital and will
not walk free after Sunday's
decision. He ^ remains under
investigation in an unrelated
case.
A small crowd of Mubarak
loyalists erupted into applause
after the ruling was announced.
Holding portraits of the former
president aloft, they broke into
chants of "Long live justice!"
Another jubilant crowd later
gathered outside the Nile-side
Cairo hospital where Mubarak
is being held, passing out can-
dies to pedestrians and motor-

ists.
Still, the crowds paled in
comparison to the immediate
reaction to Mubarak's convic-
tion and sentencing in June,
when thousands took to the
streets, some in celebration and
others in anger that he escaped
the death penalty.
Sunday's muted reaction indi-
cates the fate of Egypt's ruler of
nearly three decades may have,
at least for now, been reduced
to a political footnote in a coun-
try sagging under the weight of
a crippling economic crisis and
anxious over its future direction
under the rule of Islamists.
No date has been set for the
retrial, but attention is sure
to dramatically pick up when
it begins and Egyptians again
watch fascinated by the sight of
their country's one-time strong-
man behind bars in the defen-
dants' cage.
If convicted, Mubarak could
face a life sentence or have
it reduced. He could also be
acquitted. Under Egyptian law,
a defendant cannot face a harsh-

er sentence in a retrial, meaning
the former leader cannot face
the death penalty.
The Court of Cassation did
not immediately disclose its rea-
soning, but legal experts said
the appeal was granted over a
series of procedural problems in
the conduct of the original trial.
The ruling had been widely
expected. When Mubarak was
convicted in June, the presiding
judge criticized the prosecution's
case, saying it lacked concrete
evidence and failed to prove the
protesters were killed by the
police.
Gamal Eid, a prominent rights
lawyer, said the new trial could
include new defendants and the
judge ordering additional inves-
tigations.
Mubarak's defense lawyers
had argued the ex-president did
not know of the killings or real-
ize the extent of the street pro-
tests. But a fact-finding mission
recently determined he watched
the uprising against him unfold
through a live TV feed at his pal-
ace.

some smoke came in," Frieden said.
Frieden and Koreywere checked
in an ambulance at the scene, but
didn't require a trip to the hospi-
tal. They left the scene at around
9:45 p.m. shrouded in towels for
warmth from the cold rain.
LSA junior Ian Evans was
watching a movie from his Packard
Street living room when he heard
fire trucks in front of the nearby
complex. In past years, Evans had
friends who lived in the building.
"The building was just in blazes.
It was crazy," Evans said.
Engineering junior Casey
Schmidt, who lives near the build-

ing, said he saw a huge wall of fire
coming from the bottom window.
He said all the rooms were on
fire in addition to a nearby tree.
Schmidt said he heard a crackling
noise and thought someone was
shooting off fireworks. He noted
emergency response teams arrived
at the scene quickly.
After suppressing the fire, offi-
cers began the overhaul process,
which included cutting nearby
trees and sifting through possibly
flammable materials to prevent
the fire from flaring again. The
fire marshal was still investigating
the cause of the fire as units con-
tinued to monitor the scene into
the night.
The Red Cross is assisting
affected residents in finding tem-
porary living accommodations.

Chase talks music, debut
feature film 'Fade'

This is not a
year-end list

Former 'Sopranos'
boss delves into
'60s subculture
By CARLY KEYES
Daily Arts Writer
In his feature film directorial
debut, "Not Fade Away," David
Chase displays his passion for
rock 'n' roll music. Set in subur-
ban New Jersey, the movie fol-
lows a group of hopeful teenagers
as their band tries to "make it"
during the '60s, when the genre
exploded into American culture.
During an interview with The
Michigan Daily, Chase made it
clear that this is a film about music.
"I wanted to use lesser-known
album tracks," Chase said. "I had
an idea of the music I wanted, and
I went out and gotit."
Chase described how most of
the popular '60s tunes are already
largely associated with other clas-
sic films and directors.
"I believe that when you go to
clear The Rolling Stones' music,
you have to ask Marty Scorsese,"
he said.
And despite the monumental
historical events during that time,
he didn't want to focus on that.
"Depicting an era like the '60s
is kind of a fool's errand, and it's
been done," Chase said.
"Nobody (in the film) goes to
a protest march. You can assume
that they're taking drugs, but you
don't really see that. Nobody's
seeing flowers or anything like
that. One guy goes to Vietnam, but
you don't follow him to Vietnam."
But what's most unique about
"Not Fade Away" - apart from the
paramount focus on rock 'n' roll
- is that the story, for Chase, is a
personal one. Though they never
left the basement or settled on a
name, Chase played drums in a
band with his friends while grow-
ing up in New Jersey during this
epic music movement.
"The film is autobiographical
in terms of the feelings involved

Chase uses some of the more obscure tracks of the '60s to foster individuality in his film.

on the part of the lead character,
but not necessarily the events or
the other people," he explained.
"Except for the part about the
father. That was kind of mne and
my father."
James Gandolfini ("Zero Dark
Thirty") plays the father who
strongly discourages his son,
Douglas (John Magaro, "Liberal
Arts"), from pursuing a music
career. Gandolfini reunites with
Chase for the first time since they
worked together on "The Sopra-
nos," the mostcfinancially success-
ful television series of all time.
Chase, who created the criti-
cally acclaimed show and wrote
and directed multiple episodes,
feels a certain amount of individ-
ual pressure to perform with his
successive projects.
"I never expected creating
something that so many people
knew about and invested so much
in," he said. "I thought there's no
way I can do anything like that
again. Yet, you feel like if you
haven't done something like that
again, you've failed."
This project marked Chase's

first major jump from the small
screen to the silver screen, and
it forced him to alter his typical
writing routine.
"There was always a solid out-
line," he explained. "This time
I decided to say, 'I'm going to sit
down and write (the screenplay)
and see what happens.' I went in
without a map."
Steven Van Zandt, another for-
mer cast member of "The Sopra-
nos" and a musician with Bruce
Springteen's E Street band, pro-
duced the music and wrote the
film's original song, "St. Valen-
tine's Day Massacre." Originally,
he and Chase wanted to cast
musicians who could also act,
and considered using well-known
entertainers.
"Stars are stars and they're use-
ful in many different ways," Chase
said. "But, in retrospect, I'm really
glad we didn't use them. I think it
would've skewed the movie in a
way."
By the time filming began, Van
Zandt had molded the actors into
a truly talented band who did all
of their own vocal work and most

of their instrumental parts.
In "Not Fade Away," Chase
paints a picture of a musical era
that's a far cry from the pop mel-
odies, country ballads and rap
anthems on today's mainstream
radio stations. But, asserting that
issues America faced - sexual,
gender and racial politics - still
permeate strongly five decades
later, Chase believessome things
haven't changed.
"The '60s never got solved," he
stated, noting the major differ-
ence is that now "there's no music
to lead you through it."
Chase expanded upon this
stark contrast between the over-
arching culture of the two gen-
erations.
"Now everybody's tattooed
and has piercings. Everybody
looks like an outlaw, and they're
not really. People back then who
looked like outlaws were out-
laws."
Similarly, as authentically
showcased in "Not Fade Away,"
Chase believes that people who
looked like musicians were musi-
cians, too.

've written before about
why I don't believe in the
concept of the "best TV
show ever" or year-end lists, or
rankings in general. Our own
best televi-
sion of 2012
list was com-
piled through
a thorough
democratic
process, but,
as with any
best-of list, KAYLA
it's limited to UPADHYAYA
those fixed 10
slots, so great
shows sometimes get crowded
out.
Because I watch what many
consider to be "too much televi-
sion," I have a whole lot of last-
ing 2012 TV memories. Many
of these moments happened on
shows that made.our list: Megan
Draper's rendition of "Zou Bisou
Bisou" on "Mad Men"; every sec-
ond of Anna Gunn's performance
in "Fifty-One" on "Breaking
Bad"; Louis C.K.'s brief return to
"Parks and Recreation"; Matthew
and Mary's duet on "Downton
Abbey"; Kristina telling her fam-.
ily about her cancer on "Parent-
hood"; Ray saying "slim leg" four
times in nine seconds on "Girls";
Morgan Saylor's reading of "We
killed someone" on "Homeland."
ButI also want to give a shout-
out to the shows that didn't make
our list because, believe me, they
too featured many ofthe year's
defining TV moments and, even
thoughI hate year-end lists,
some sort of yearly reflection is
expected of us writers. So let's just
call this my anti-year-end list (or
not even a list at all... a collection
of anecdotes in absolutely no par-
ticular order) soI don't feel like a
sellout.
While Daily Arts's list consists
of almost entirely dramas, both
new and established comedies
left their mark in 2012. "Louie"
continued to be the saddest funny
show on air, capping off a near-
perfect season with "New Year's
Eve,"-an emotional masterpiece

that convinced me that those
calling the show the "Sopranos"
of TV comedy are 100-percent
right.
In the face of probable cancel-
lation, "Cougar Town" turned
in its best season. "Happy End-
ings" gave us a krumping Elisha
Cuthbert and Brad and Max's 4
best shenanigan yet: a bar mitz-
vah emcee group called "Boyz
II Menorah." "Community"
somehow topped its first fake clip
show with a second. "30 Rock"
wavered, but it also concocted
the most bizarre and hilarious
rendering of Leap Day. And when
I attempted to make a list of my
favorite lines from 2012, about
half belonged to the mouth of
Jane Krakowski's Jenna Maroney
("Go jump back up your mother!"
and "I'm goingto be constructive
here, you should kill yourself" are
tied for first place).
But most of my TV time is
occupiedby dramas and, this
year, there were many episodes of
both cable and network dramas
that I admire. Too many, in fact,
to list. And this isn't supposed to
be a list anyway, remember? But
here are some thoughts on the
moments I can't stop thinking
about: Boyd Crowder's town hall
speech on "Justified" made me
hope that Walton Goggins one
day runs for president. "Revenge"
became the showI most look
forward to every week. "The
Vampire Diaries" put forth a sea-
son finale so shocking, I actually
fell off of my couch. "Nashville"
put Connie Britton and Hayden
Panettiere on a stage together
and made magic happen (the
show also made me love Panet-
tiere - another act of sorcery).

This is just a
tribute.

As with every year, TV lost
some good ones in 2012. The USA
soap "Political Animals," with its
powerhouse cast led by Sigour-
ney Weaver and Carla Gugino,
mixed politics and family drama
to great effect. Phoebe Tonkin's
Faye, a teen witch on the CW's
"Secret Circle,"'was one of my
favorite female characters until
the series was vanquished.
Remember, this is not a best-of
list, but if I were hypothetically
forced at gunpoint to choose a top
show for 2012, it would be one
thatdid not make the Daily's list
at all. It would be a show that I
myself despised during its promo-
tional campaign and after seeing
its pilot. After I got sick of my
friend nagging me to give "New
Girl" -yes, the FOX sitcom that
boasts a wide-eyed, ukulele-bear-
ing Zooey Deschanel - a second
chance, I tuned back in for what I
was certain would be a shitshow.
Instead, I met a show that had
figured its characters out. Max
Greenfield's Emmy-nominated
performance as Schmidt - who
wears kimonos and loses count-
less dollars to the Douchebag Jar
by sayingthings like "Have you
seen my sharkskin laptop sleeve?"
and "Damnit, I can't find my driv-
ingmoccasins anywhere!" -is
aseason one highlight, but it's
Jake Johnson's surly, perpetually
uncomfortable Nick Miller who
emerges as the hilarious standout
in the show's 2012 run.
"New Girl" wasn'tthe only
show that proved me wrong in
2012. When Shonda Rhimes's
"Scandal" came to ABC last
spring, I was certain it would be a
hilarious disaster. The executive
producer of "Grey's Anatomy"
attempting a political thriller?
Come on. As it turns out, the
Kerry Washington-led serial
about D.C.'s premier "fixer" and
public relations wizard Olivia
Pope could easily be mistaken for
a cable drama. It's sexy and smart
and manages to tie geopolitical
issues into its pulpy narrative
organically.
I didn't evengetto dozens of
shows I wanted to discuss. But
hey, having too many great shows
is a good problem for a TV lover
to have. Just don't make me sort
them into a numbered list, I beg
of you.

People are talking about "Zero

ing about the Kathryn Bigelow-
directed, Mark
Boal-penned A
spy thriller
centered on Zero Dark
the intelligence Thirty
hunt for Osama
bin Laden AtQuality16
since before its and Rave
release, stir-
ring up enough Columbia
controversy to
cause two release date changes.
The right decries it as a pro-
Obama liberal propaganda piece;
the left interprets it as a torture
apologia and patriotic attempt to
defend the War on Terror.
If this project were in the hands
of any other filmmaker, these crit-
icisms might be more defensible.
But this is the first-rate produc-
tion team behind 2008's visceral
"The Hurt Locker," and Bigelow
fiercely delves into the harrow-
ing world of post-9/11 intelligence
with emotional honesty, though
not always with complete truth.
The film is largely rooted in
the real people and events central
to the bin Laden manhunt, but it
takes liberties with many of the
details, as it's ultimately a film,
not a documentary.
The most important and effec-
tive liberty the story takes is with
Maya (Jessica Chastain, "Take
Shelter"), whose character is
inspired by a femaleintelligence
officer critical to the manhunt,
but ultimately an amalgamation
of fact and fiction that character-
izes much of the film.
Maya is methodical, frenetic,
thorough. Her intellect slices
through everything she says.
And it's through her eyes that
much of the narrative unravels.
. KTHEFBTGGEST

Though the movie boasts inter-
esting characters (Jason Clarke
plays a twisted CIA interrogator
who wants out of the field) and
an impressive cast of familiar
faces, the only intimate charac-
ter connection the script allows
for is with Maya. And even with
her, there's a distance; we never
immerse as deeply into her psyche
as with Sergeant First Class Wil-
liam James in "Hurt Locker."
"Zero Dark Thirty" certainly
thrusts itself into the national
debate on torture, but by filtering
the story through this dogmatic
woman, Bigelow also touches
issues of sexism. Throughout the
movie, characters in the macho
spy world refer to Maya as "the
girl." She's asked to sit at the back
of a meeting with the CIA direc-
tor (James Gandolfini, TV's "The
Sopranos") about the compound
believed to house bin Laden. The
director blithely asks the men in
the room who "the girl" is - to
which Maya replies, emphatically:
"I'm the motherfucker who found
this place." Chastain doesn't have
a ton of dialogue, but every time
her mouth opens, sparks fly.
The only time the film overtly
plays to the audience's emotions
is in the opening sequence - a
black screen scored with horrify-
ing sound bites from 9/11. Though
emotional at times, "Zero Dark
Thirty" is first and foremost a
technical wonder. There's a jour-
nalistic quality to Bigelow's eye,
and her auteuristic hand makes
"Zero Dark Thirty" more absorb-
ing than a glamorized spy flick -
but it also gets her into trouble.
The only editing misstep was the
decision to divide the film into
titled chapters, which gives it too
much of the documentary feel
that critics claim will persuade
the audience to believe torture
led to actionable intelligence, as it
does in the movie.
But "Zero Dark Thirty" doesn't
say torture was necessary; it says
that torture happened. Boal's
sweeping script and Bigelow's
keen direction are a formidable

display of restraint. There's noth-
ing overtly patriotic about the
film; it's as critical of America as it
is reverent of the individuals who
gave their everything to the fight.
Maya is nearly monstrous in her
obsession, as zealous as the men
she pursues. It's these contradic-
tions that make it possible for
opposing ideologies to interpret it
in such different ways.
Instead of distinguishing
between bad and good, Bigelow
meticulously examines the moral
complexities of the War on Ter-
ror. Maya's response to her sta-
tion chief when he asks what she
thinks of Pakistan applies here,
and to both sides: "It's kinda
fucked up."
Darkness seeps through "Zero
Dark Thirty," into its characters,
into its politics. Maya seems to
haunt her own office and home:
In one particularly indelible shot,
the camera moves with her as she
emerges from a lightless hall.
Its title is military speak for
the dead of night: 12:30 a.m., the
precise time of the Navy SEAL
strike in Pakistan that resulted in
bin Laden's death. If "Zero Dark
Thirty" is Bigelow's technical
symphony, the strike is her fourth
movement. Cinematographer
Greig Fraser doesn't frame the raid
as a stylized Hollywood retelling.
Using an infrared light mounted
on the camera along with a night
vision device attached to the lens
mount, he captures the moonless
Pakistani night with stark natu-
ralism - the cameras move with
the SEALs so that it's practically a
first-person viewing, keeping the
stakes high even when you know
what's coming.
Fitting for a film that has
everyone arguing, interpretations
of the final shot differ from one
viewer to the next. It's a testa-
ment to Chastain's power to make
people feel the weight of the scene
in varying degrees and ways, but
it's also a testament to the film's
ability to be many things at once.
So, keep talking. Provocation
is "Zero Dark Thirty"'s specialty.

Throughout my childhood in
Livonia, Mich., there was a bar
and restaurant three miles from
my house that had the world's
greatest chicken fingers. By the
time I had reached middle school,
the restaurant was about to go
under and had started instituting
ridiculous marketing schemes
to draw in patrons. As regular
customers, my family and I had
happened to reap the benefits of
many "Deal Days" toward the
end of the establishment's life,
and I was convinced that I had
found heaven in those free bowls
of ice cream and plates of french
fries.
One night, to my disappoint-
ment, we discovered that the
restaurant had stopped the free
food specials in lieu of a weekly
karaoke night. Understandably, I
was pretty bitter about the news.
When the waitress came to our
table and asked if anyone wanted
to sign up to sing, I resentfully
slumped in my seat. While I was
trying my best to appear upset
about the lack of free, fattening
menu items, my younger sister
(a talented singer and fearlessly
outgoing individual) quickly vol-
unteered.
In retrospect, the karaoke ses-
sion that followed was an allegory
for life, depicting its increasingly
depressing stages through (for
the most part) terribly interpret-
ed song.
The evening began adorably
with two children with lisps
singing "Twinkle Twinkle Lit-
tle Star." 'The entire restaurant
watched intently and smiled at
the innocent way the kids sang
the wrong words and giggled
throughout. After completingthe
one and only verse they knew,
the children blushed, returned to
their smiling parents and enjoyed
plates of chicken fingers without
a care in the world.

near comeback

Buckeyes spoil chance
at top ranking in nation

Freshman point
guard brought 'M'

By STEVEN BRAID
Daily SportsEditor
COLUMBUS - Michigan
coach John Beilein glanced down
his bench. He was looking for
someone, anyone, who was going
to play with control, play with
heart, play like they wanted 'to
be on the court at the Value City
Arena against No. 15 Ohio State
in Columbus.

The enormity of the stage
appeared too large for the sec-
ond-ranked Wolverines, the
pressure too high. They commit-
ted eight turnovers in the first10
minutes of action. Their offense
was stagnant, and their defense
was soft.
And so with less than seven
minutes remaining in the first
half, and Michigan down 29-8,
Beilein inserted backup point
guard Spike Albrecht into the
game.
"We just wanted him to keep
things simple," Beilein said.
"He's a single hitter."

Burke's 3-pointer
rattles out in final
seconds of loss
By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
COLUMBUS - A win would
have made Michigan the No. 1
team in the country for the first
time since 1992.
A successful showing in
Columbus would have made the
Wolverines 17-0, their best start

in program history.
Beating Ohio State would
have given Michigan coach
John Beilein his best start to a
season as a coach anywhere, at
any level.
Maybe most importantly, a
win would have proved that the
relatively untested Wolverines
could compete with the best
teams in the country on the
road, and it could have made the
upcoming gauntlet that, is the
Big Ten seem a little more man-
ageable.
But in its biggest game of the

season, on its biggest stage, No. 2
Michigan was outmatched, out-
played and beat up for most of
the contest in a 56-53 loss to No.
15 Ohio State on Sunday.
Sophomore point guard Trey
Burke, a Columbus native who
grew up wanting to play for the
Buckeyes, started the game off
with a confident 3-pointer. This
was the Michigan fans had seen
all season - bold, strong and at
times, cocky. This was expected.
The Wolverines not scor-
ing for the next seven minutes
and 44 seconds of game time

was not. By the time freshman
forward Glenn Robinson III
hit Michigan's second bucket, a
3-pointer, Michigantrailed 16-6.
The Wolverines couldn't move
the ball against Ohio State's
physical perimeter defenders
and struggled to get the ball
even close to the key.
"This team - and (Ohio State
coach Thad Matta's) teams have
always been this way - but
this one, the perimeter defense
in particular is exceptional,"
Beilein said of the Buckeyes.

Making history,

Michigan off
 to best start in
program history
By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Writer
It wasn't pretty for the Michi-
gan women's basketball team
Sunday, but, as they have each
of the previous eight games, the
Wolverines found a way to win.
Michigan beat Wisconsin 54-43
at the Crisler Center to extend
its winning streak to nine and
to improve upon its best start in
program history.
"Golly that was ugly," said
Michigan
coach Kim WISCONSIN 43
Barnes MICHIGAN 54
Arico.
"But we've said multiple times
to this point, an ugly win is bet-
ter than a pretty loss."
It took the Wolverines (3-0
Big Ten, 14-2 overall) 6:33 to
hit their first field goal, and by
then, the Badgers led 9-0. The

basket came from senior guard
Jenny Ryan and was quickly fol-
lowed by a turnover by Wiscon-
sin (0-3, 8-9) and a jump shot on
the other end from senior center
Rachel Sheffer.
Little did Michigan know,
those four points would be
almost a quarter of the points
scored in the first half by the
Wolverines, who produced their
second-lowest scoring half this
season with just 19 points.
In the first 12 minutes of play,
Michigan shot a measly 16.7 per-
cent from the field. The Badgers'
offense, though, was no better,
ending the half shooting 33 per-
cent from the field.
"Wisconsin really exposed
us offensively," Barnes Arico
said., "They did a tremendous
job on the defensive end. I was
happy we were able to make
(some) plays in the second half
and come from behind which is
something we haven't had to do
much all year."
In the second half, the Wol-
verines were unable to clean up
their offensive slump, but they

Wolverines for the first time in
an all-time series that isn't at
all close. Entering-the weekend,
Michigan led 42-10-1.
Ferguson knew that the
Nanooks were making his-
tory, but forgive him if he's still

adjusting to takingsix points in
one weekend. This season, six
points in amonth was closer to
the norm.
"To be honest with you, it's
the first sweep we've had in a
long time as a program," Fer-
guson said. "Michigan - I've
always had so much respect
for their program and for their
coaching staff. For our team to
come in on the road and get six
points, it's real big for us."
If Alaska was trying to play
the role of the underdog this
weekend, it didn't do a very good
job.
Red Berenson is adjusting
too; it's the sweepers who have
become the sweepees.
"In years past, we would lose
a game but we'd bounce back
the next night," Berenson said.
"I can't remember being swept
like we are this year. Look in the
records, I don't think that's hap-
pened in a long time."

For Michigan, a long fall down to Earth

Nobody is perfect.
Arizona and then

wiched around No.2 Michigan
atop the national rankings last
week, finally fell in last-minute
thrillers over
the weekend

verines' date

son, a win or

little. But
for Michigan, the last unbeaten
team standing, a victory over the
Buckeyes would have definitively
marked the Wolverines' long-
awaited return. It would have
meant a No.1 ranking for the first
time since 1992. Itwould have put
Michigan at 17-0 for the first time
in program history.
It would have...
But the Wolverines hurtled
back to Earth.
They fumbled and flopped out
of the gate, looking very much like
a team playing on the road in one
of the fiercest environments in
college basketball. They suffered
lengthy scoring droughts in the
first half and failed to register
a two-point field goal until 11

around the rim and out.
Michigan lost, 56-53. No longer
perfect.
Nobody is.
In the end, it was the type of
battle everyone expected between
two top-20 teams. It'sjust hard
to win that battle when you spot
the opponent a double-digit lead
before you get your second bas-
ket. It's hard to win when your
3-point specialist, Stauskas, goes
cold and finishes 0-for-3 for zero
points. It's hard to win when your
starting five, which averages 65.7
points per game, gives you just 40
- and when your leadingscorer
for much of the game is a little-
used backup point guard.
And it's darn near impossible
when all that happens against
your bitter rival, on the road in
the toughest conference in Amer-
ica. But Michigan nearly pulled
it out.
And that is the difference
between this Michigan team
and the ones of the last 15 years.
This team has the talent to hang
around even when the shots
don't fall. It has the coaching to
recognize the weaknesses and
the hot hands, the know-how to
precipitate swings in momentum,
the smarts to leave a hot Albrecht
in. Ohio State did everything
it needed to win and Michigan
gave far from the effort it would
have liked, but it came down to a

one-possession game, far from an
embarrassment.
The No.1 ranking will have to
wait. Michigan will fall a hand-
ful of spots, but it has still proven
to be a top-flight program with
serious staying power. It's bard to Y
overstate the strength of the Big
Ten this season, with No. 2 Michi-
gan, No. 5 Indiana, No.12 Illinois,
No.15 Ohio State and No. 22
Michigan State leading the way in
the national rankings.
They're going to beat up on
each other. It's already happening,
just look back on the weekend.
Ohio State was embarrassed by
Illinois, then beat Michigan. the
FightingIllini came off their
rout of the Buckeyes and were
thrashed by unranked Wisconsin.
Minnesota rallied from a 23-point
halftime deficit to nearly sneak
past Indiana.
There's not much Michigan
can do except swallow the sting
of defeat and get back up for the
next one - the high-flying Golden
Gophers play host on Thursday.
The Wolverines weren't going
to carry the label of "undefeated"
for too long. Not in this confer-
ence, not with the parity ofcol-
lege basketball. And that's OK.

length pool was well-received
by the Wolverines, as they won
the first seven events and 10 of 13
overall en route to a 153-90 vic-
tory.
The Wolverines were once
again led by Fletcher, whose vic-
tories in the 400-yard medley
relay and 200 butterfly gave him
five wins total on the weekend,
tops on the team. While always
focused on winning, Fletcher was
particularly pleased with his per-
formance this weekend.
"The turns, counting my kicks,
all the tiny details become very
important," Fletcher said. "Espe-
cially as we head towards the end
of the season. (This weekend) was
a really good meet to help focus on
that."
The wins over Purdue and
Eastern Michigan mark the
return to competition after win-
ter break for Michigan. After end-
ing 2012 by winning the Hawkeye
Invitational on Dec. 3, the Wol-
verines wanted to keep their
momentum going through finals
and the break.
"It's a difficult time for them,"
White said. "They're swimming
and doing finals, and then they
go home to see their family, but
still have to get out and get to a
pool. I think they did a great job

of (training over break) because
when we came back to training,
they picked it up without missing
a beat."
After a few days at home, the
Wolverines regrouped and took
their traditional training trip to
Florida. Both Fletcher and White
believe this trip was their best in
recent memory, citing nicer facili-
ties and a team-first atmosphere
as reasons for the success. '
"Every group was just killing it
every day," Fletcher said. "Every-
one was just really supportive of
eachsother and that's helped push
us to where we are now."
Before the break, Bottom
viewed the break as an indica-
tor of what the rest of the season
would bring, From what White
saw this weekend, that indication
is good.
"We saw a lot of great things in
all facets," White said. "Being in
great shape, having good speed,
and just feeling good. I don't think
we need to make many adjust-
ments, we're right on track and
where we expect to be.

MICHIGAN
From Page lB
"Why? They've been doing the
same shell drills for two, three,
four years. They really work at
this and they are really good at
it"
Michigan's swagger slowly
evaporated - shots that were
usually taken from deep weren't
taken, passes into the lane were
timid and drives to the basket led
to turnovers more often than not.
It all came down to turnovers:
the Buckeyes capitalized by forc-
ing 13 of them against a team that
averages 9.3 a game. Michigan
had nine in the first half alone,
and ten minutes into the game,
the Wolverines had more turn-
overs, seven, than points scored,
*six.,
xn five different games this
year, the Wolverines have com-
nitted less than seven turnovers.
?n Sunday, they had seven less

"They came out and beat us up
a bit," saud junior forward Tim
Hardaway Jr. "We have to know
how to control the pressure and
play better."
Michigan looked lost offen-

"The thing about Jenny is that
she is so smart that she knows
(when) nobody else is scoring,
(and) nobody else is looking to
score (she) knows (she) needs to
step up and needs to make plays,"
Barnes Arico said. "Tonight
she knew that. we needed her to
score, and she did what she had
to do to help us find a way to win.
She was incredible tonight.
"We have a group of seniors
that really dedicated themselves.
They (were) here all summer
really working on tryingto create
something special. They deserve
all the credit and I kind of want
them to enjoy the moment but
not get caught up in it."
The success of the seniors has
been the story for this team all

sively in the first half, unsure of
what to do against the contact
and pressure of the home team. It
scored just 22 points in the first
half - a season low - and even
that was after a 14-5 run to close
the half.
All in all, starting the second
half down 12 was pretty reason-
able considering how poorly the
game had started for the Wolver-
ines.
Slowly, Michigan started to
chip away in the second half.
Cutting down on the turnovers
helped - it committed just four.
in the second half - but it also
started to crash the boards with
a little more ferocity and to take
some of those shots it was pass-
ing up earlier.
"In the second half, I think we
came out the way we should have
came out in the first half," Burke
said. "It was too late. It was two
or three possessions too late."
Going into the game, the big
matchup was between Burke and
Ohio State point guard Aaron
Craft, who is regarded as one of
the best defenders in the country.
Burke played fine, ending with
a team-high fifteen points, but
he also had four turnovers to go
along with just four assists. He
season. When Michigan starts
out slow, its seniors pick up the
pieces. .
Responsible for 80 percent
of the Wolverines' offense, the
five seniors have led this team
all season. In the first half, 18
of Michigan's 19 points came
from the seniors - the lone
point belonged to sophomore
guard Brenae Harris. Overall the
seniors accounted for 44 of the
54 points scored on Sunday.
Through the first 15 games of
the season, Michigan ranks sev-
enth in the nation in field-goal
percentage at 47 percent and
third nationally in 3-point field-
goal percentage at 41-percent.
The Badgers were able to con-
tain Michigan's red-hot offense
by forcing the Wolverines to
use most of the shot clock dur-
ing their possessions. In the
first half, Michigan hit just one
3-pointer on seven attempts and

wasn't able to drive as well as
usual, and Craft was in his face
all night.
"Craft is as good as there is, as
good as I've ever seen," Beilein
said. "He's tremendous."
Added Craft: "Any time you get
to play against a great guy like.
(Burke), you have some incentive
to go out and see what you can do.
Our defense did what it needed to
do today, and that really helped."
Still, Michigan found other
ways to score. Burke's backup,
freshman Spike Albrecht, con-
tributed seven first-half points,
and Hardaway contributed 12.
But Hardaway needed 15 shots
to score those 12 points. Burke
needed 13 shots to score his 15
points.
Freshman forward Nik Staus-
kas, who averages almost 14
points a game, didn't score.
As a team, the Wolverines
made less than 40 percent of
their shots, in a season where
they average more than the 50
percent from the floor.
"We had five freshman play.

and they did not have a freshman

ended the game with a season
low two 3-pointers on 13.3-per-
cent shooting.
Senior forward Kate Thomp-
son, who normally leads the.
way on the offensive side of the
court, was held scoreless in the
first half. She ended the game
with just six points on the day on
20-percent shooting, well below
her season average of 16 points
per game, on 48-percent shoot-
ing. Thompson did not hit her
first field goal until nine minutes
into the second half.
The slow offenses of both
teams made way for the defenses
to steal the show. As they have
been all season, the Wolverines
were plagued by turnovers, com-
mitting seven in the first 10 min-
utes of play and 14 overall. Ryan
committed six. Michigan was
able to compensate for missed
shots and turnovers with its
quickness to get back on defense.

teams on the road."
It was close at the end. Michi-
gan got to within one point with
more than six minutes left in the
game. Then, a fast break, one-
handed alley-oop by Ohio State
forward Sam Thomson lit the
crowd on fire. Robinson, calmly,
sank a three at the other end to
tie the game.
But Buckeye forward Deshaun
Thomas, who led all scorers with
20 points, responded with a dunk
of his own at the other end toput
Ohio State back in the lead, and
that was the closest Michigan
got.
Even to the bitter end, Michi-
gan never stopped clawing. Burke
had the ball with a chance to win
the game, down two with 20 sec-
onds left. He shot a deep three
- again, with Craft in his face
- as the shot clock was winding
down and eight seconds left in
the game. The shot went halfway
in, but spun and rattled out. Ohio
State made its free throws down
the stretch to seal the game.
Burke and the Wolverines had
a chance at the end, in a game
that looked out of hand from the
beginning, but couldn't finish in
their quest for the nation's top
spot.
"As much as we talk about
Wisconsin's defense, our defense
really kept us in the game
because we weren't scoring so we
had to get stops the other way,"
Barnes Arico said. "(But when)
we weren't scoring at least they
weren't scoring. So I felt a little
bit better about that."
Added Ryan: "Luckily our
conditioning kind of came
through, and we were able to get
up and down the court a little bit
more. We just settled in. The first
half we just couldn't really find a
rhythm, none of our shots were
going in. I think at halftime we
talked about making a new day,
and that's what we did."
The rebounding battle and
the overall defensive stand kept
Michigan alive when it was
unable to find the basket. The
Wolverines out rebounded the
Badgers 20-15 in the first half
and 35-27 overall.

ALBRECHT
From Page 1B
And without a care in the
world, Albrecht started to run
the show, playing like he was the
most experienced member of
the Wolverines. He drew a quick
foul on Ohio State guard Aaron
Craft. On the next possession,
he took the ball to the hole and
earned Michigan's first free-
throw attempts of the contest.
The momentum started
to slowly shift. Two minutes
later, two more free throws by
,Albrecht, and the deficit was cut
to 16 points.
"It was great to see him out
there getting his teammates
involved, playing good defense
and having fun," said junior
swingman Hardaway Jr.
And with the sparsely used
reserve in command of the team,
Michigan found new life. A dunk
from redshirt junior center Jor-.
dan Morgan followed by two
more Albrecht free throws.
Afewmomnentslater,Albrecht
confidently stepped into a three-
pointer at the top of the key to
cut Michigan's deficit to 14.
With the 5-foot-11, freshman
on the floor, the Wolverines fin-
ished the stanza on a 14-5 run.
With all the big names on this
roster, and all the highly-touted
freshmanthathave made aname
for themselves in the early going
of this season, it was Albrecht
who was conducting the resur-
gence in the mosthostile of envi-
ronments, leadingthe team with
a career-high of seven points as
it entered the locker room.
"He definitely gave us a spark

out there," Hardaway Jr said.
"We're happy that he came out
here and just tried to play his
game and play in the flow of the
offense, and that's what we need
from him continuing on."
It was that spark that caused
Beilein to substitute Albrecht
into the game with less than
four minutes gone by in the sec-
ond half. With the Wolverines
facing a 13-point deficit, the
reserve stuck to his role. Play-
ing alongside Burke, he moved
the ball around on offense and
created havoc on defense, even
intercepting a pass that led to a
layup from freshman forward
Mitch McGary, which narrowed
the deficit to eight points.
"He was terrific in there,"
Beilein said. "He was very
steady when he was in there and
when we played the two little
guys in there together, that was
even better."
Though Albrecht's statistical
contribution in the second half
was miniscule'- he only had a
rebound and a steal in four min-
utes - his handprints were all
over the ignition of Michigan's
attempted comeback, which
got as close as two points in the
waning seconds of the contest.
The coaches rewarded him with
his most playing time since the
second week of the season.
And even when he appeared
to play outside of himself, the
coaching staff took it as an
encouraging sign
"He took a step-back three in
transition, which probably isn't
(what he does best), but you've
got to applaud that - he's not
wilting, he wants to make it hap-
pen," Beilein said.
