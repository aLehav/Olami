ELECTION 2012
Fight over
citizenship
checkbox
goes to court

Legal battle
ensues over state
policy to affirm
citizenship
By TUI RADEMAKER
Daily StaffReporter
When. Michigan's 7.3 mil-
lion registered voters head to
the polls on Nov. 6, they will
be expected to check a box to
verify their citizenship status,
a change recently added to the
ballot by Republican Secretary
of State Ruth Johnson.
The new policy was met with
opposition from civil rights
and labor interest groups, and
on Sept. 17, the American Civil
Liberties Union filed a lawsuit
against the Secretary of State's
office claiming that the measure
is unconstitutional.
Judge Paul Borman ordered
a hearing in a federal district
court in Detroit for Friday
morning. ACLU staff attorney
Dan Korobkin said he hopes the
judge will be able to take the
box off the ballot in time for the
November election.
"We don't think that ... non-

citizens should be able to vote in
elections but the law is already
clear ... and in fact in order to
register to vote you have tobe a
citizen of the United States and
that's very clear on the registra-
tion form."Korobkin said.
Gisgie Gendreau, a spokes-
woman for Johnson, said the
citizenship checkbox is a nec-
essary measure designed to
confirm that voters are acting
legally.
"The ques-
tion is meant
to ensure that 2012
only qualified
voters are in
the election
because if a non-citizen votes,
he or she could be committing
a felony and they could be fac-
ing charges and deportation,"
Gendreau said. "The Secretary
is committed to ensuring that
we have ... only qualified voters
vote."
The change' comes in tse
wake of a series of laws recently
passed in 31 states that require
voters to show photo identi-
fication at polling locations.
Many activist groups claim the
policies would disenfranchise
minority and lower-income

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
Water union
demands amnesty
The union for striking Detroit
Water and Sewerage Department
' workers says it will continue
the walkout until the city gives
amnesty to 34 workers threat-
ened with firing.
The union struck Sunday to
protest Detroit's plan to downsize
the department and eliminate
most of the jobs in the depart-
ment over several years.
On Monday, department
Director Sue McCormick wrote
to 34 strikers that they're being
suspended and face firing
because they "engaged in gross
misconduct that endangered pub-
lic health and safety."
PORTLAND, Ore.
Ore. pot measure
struggles as Wash.,
Colo. gain support
As marijuana legalization
efforts in Colorado and Wash-
ington pick up steam, a similar
push in Oregon seems to be going
up in smoke.
More than $4 million has
flowed to Washington and close
to a million in Colorado.
Yet in Oregon - a state with
one of the nation's highest rates
of pot use and a reputation for
pushing the boundaries on mari-
juana laws - organizers are
looking at a bank account with
just $1,800.
Marijuana activists who have
ploughed big bucks into cam-
paigns in the other two states
complain the Oregon measure is
poorly written and doesn't poll
well. It didn't qualify for the bal-
lot until July, severely limiting
the time available to sway voters.
NASHVILLE
Rare meningitis
cases at 26 in 5
states, 4 deaths
An outbreak of a rare and
deadly form of meningitis has
now sickened 26 people in five
states who received steroid
injections mostly for back pain,
health officials said Wednesday.
Four people have died, and more
cases are expected.
Eighteen of the cases of fun-
gal meningitis are in Tennessee
where a Nashville clinic received
the largest shipment of the ste-
roid suspected in the outbreak.
The drug was made by a specialty
pharmacy in Massachusetts that
issued a recall last week. Investi-
gators, though, say they are still'
trying to confirm the source of
the infections.
Three cases have been report-
ed in Virginia, two in Maryland,
two in Florida and one in North
Carolina. Two of the deaths
were in Tennessee; Virginia and
Maryland had one each, the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Pre-
vention.

BELGRADE, Serbia
s Human rights
activist arrested
Serbia's police on Wednesday
banned a Gay Pride march in
Belgrade, citing security con-
cerns but also complying with a
request from Serbia's Christian
Orthodox church.
Police said they were banning
the march planned for Saturday
because they feared a repeat of
the violence in 2010, when right-
winggroups attacked aGay Pride
event in Belgrade. That triggered
day-long clashes with the police
which left more than 100 people
injured.
Last year's gay pride march
also was banned by authorities.
The current ban was
announced after Patriarch Irinej,
the head of Serbia's Christian
Orthodox church, urged the gov-
ernment to prevent Saturday's
march. In a statement, he said
such a "parade of shame" would
cast a "moral shadow" on Serbia
- a conservative Balkan country
whose gay population has faced
threats and harassment.

Supporters of opposition presidential candidate Henrique Capriles cheer during a campaign rally in Venezuela.
Fears abound ahead of
close Venezuelan election

Violence could
erupt if either
candidate loses
CARACAS, Venezuela (AP)
- Venezuelan voters Luis Gus-
tavo Marin and Dunia Nessi are
on opposite sides of the politi-
cal spectrum, but as Sunday's
election draws closer they both
fear what will happen if their
candidate loses.
Marin, the security chief for
a judge and a firm supporter of
President Hugo Chavez, worries
that opposition candidate Hen-
rique Capriles will launch a vio-
lent purge of Chavez supporters
if he wins. If the president
prevails, Nessi, a 62-year-old
accountant, believes violent
crime that has run rampant
under Chavez will spiral even
further out of control.
"There is absolutely no secu-
rity," Nessi said. "If he wins I'll
either have to stay and live with
the tension or I can pack two
suitcases, throw four things
into them and leave."
Fear of every stripe, in fact,
permeates the intensely polar-
ized campaign, with many
votes to be decided based not
on the candidates' promises but
rather on what worries people
most. Capriles has intentionally
avoided stoking voter fears.
"There will be neither hate,
nor revenge, nor payback" if he
is elected, Capriles told a rally
Wednesday in Maracaibo, the
country's second city:
But Chavez has taken an
opposite tack by continuously
warning of chaos and the dis-
mantling of the generous wel-

fare state he built if he is voted
out of office.
Tensions were only height-
ened when two members of
a Capriles caravan were shot
dead Saturday in the western
state of Barinas. The victims'
relatives blamed Chavez sup-
porters and said the attack was
unprovoked. Both Capriles and
Chavez called for non-violence
in the wake of the killings,
even as the president continued
using heated rhetoric.
For the first time facing
such a formidable challenger,
Chavez has painted a dire pic-
ture of a Venezuela returning
to its stratified past when it was
ruled by greedy elites, which
Chavez says Capriles repre-
sents.
"I believe that this is true,
if the Venezuelan bourgeoisie
tries to apply this package Ven-
ezuela could see a civil war,"
Chavez said last month at a
rally in Charallave in central
Venezuela.
Chavez repeats almost daily
that his opponent would take
away benefits funded in part
by nearly $1 trillion in income
from petroleum exports over
the past decade, no matter that
Capriles has pledged to leave
the programs alone. Free medi-
cal care, subsidized food and
other entitlements have helped
lift tens of thousands of people
out of poverty, government fig-
ures show.
"They would take away
health care, food, pensions,"
Chavez told supporters Tues-
day at a rally in the western city
of Barquisimeto.
The president's supporters,
known as Chavistas, say they

also fear that Capriles will
launch a witch hunt if he wins.
"We saw the model of gov-
ernment they are going to apply
on April 11, 2002," Marin said,
referring to a failed attempt
to overthrow Chavez that the
military thwarted. In the hours
shortly after the coup, inter-
im President Pedro Carmona
Estanga famously dissolved
Congress and disbanded the
Supreme Court.
For their part, Chavez critics
point to what they say is a coor-
dinated attempt to shut them up
and force them to back the presi-
dent.
Some government workers
have said they worry about los-
ing their jobs if they support
Capriles. Fears of retribution
for not backing Chavez first
emerged in 2004 when a ruling
party deputy released a list of
some 2 million people who had
supported a referendum against
the president. Many complained
then that state employees on
the list were fired. The national
government employs at least 2.4
million people.
Adding to those fears, some
suspect their ballots won't
be kept secret, despite assur-
ances to the contrary from the
Chavez-dominated National
Electoral Council. The govern-
ment did not invite interna-
tional electoral observers, so
the Capriles camp has mounted
its own parallel organization of
vote talliers and says it will have
volunteers at every polling sta-
tion feeding a central tally kept
by the opposition.
Despite such concerns, voter
turnout Sunday is expected to
top 75 percent.

1,000 pot plants in Chicago

Officers chopped
down plants days
before harvest.
CHICAGO (AP) - In Chi-
cago, a bustling urban metrop-
olis where skyscrapers are as
likely to sprout up as anything
a farmer might plant, someone
decided there was just enough
room to grow something a little
more organic: Marijuana.
The plants grew even taller
than the tallest Chicago Bulls.
However, just days before the
crop on a chunk of land the
size of two football fields would
have been ready to harvest, a
police officer and county sher-
iff's deputy ina helicopter spot-
ted it as they headed back to
their hangar about three miles
away.
On Wednesday, a day after
the discovery of the largest
marijuana farm anyone at the
police department can remem-
ber, officers became farmers
for a day as they began to chop
down about 1,500 marijuana
plants that police said could
have earned the growers as
much as $10 million.
No arrests had been made as
of Wednesday, and police were
still trying to determine who
owns the property that housed
the grow site on the city's far
South Side. But police said they
were hopeful that because of
the size of the operation, infor-
Â£

mants or others might pro-
vide tips about those involved,
including a man seen running
from the area as the helicopter
swooped low.
James O'Grady, the com-
mander of the department's
narcotics division, said they've
never seen anything like it
before, in part because Chica-
go's harsh winters mean grow-
ers have a lot less time to plant,
grow and harvest marijuana
than their counterparts in less
inclement places such as Cali-
fornia and Mexico. The bum-
per crop was likely planted in
spring, O'Grady said.
Add to that the urban sprawl:
there are few spots in Chicago
where such an operation could
go unnoticed because of all
the buildings, roads and resi-
dents. The growers took pains
to ensure their crop was largely
hidden by a canopy of trees and
surrounding vegetation.
"Somebody put a lot of
thought into it," O'Grady said.
"But they probably didn't antic-
ipate the helicopter."
Chicago Police Officer Stan
Kuprianczyk, a pilot, said
police helicopters flew "over it
all the time," to and from their
hangar, without spying the
grow site. Yet somehow, a num-
ber of factors came together to
allow Cook County Sheriff's
Deputy Edward Graney to spot
the plants.
"We had the right altitude,
the right angle, the right sun-

light, and I happened to be
glancing down," said Graney.
He said he initially spotted five
plants or so through the trees
before he asked Kuprianczyk to
circle around for a closer look.
"We just happened to be
right over a small hole in the
trees and we looked down,"
Kuprianczyk said.
They also happened to have
the right training, Graney
said, explaining that just a few
weeks earlier a much smaller
operation in suburban Chicago
prompted them to fly over and
videotape the scene so they
might be able to recognize mar-
ijuana if they ever saw it from
the air again.
So, by the time Graney spot-
ted the marijuana plants, which
are a much brighter shade of
green than the surrounding
vegetation, he had a pretty good
idea what he was looking at.
Superintendent Garry
McCarthy, whose officers are
more used to intercepting ship-
ments of marijuana grown
elsewhere or discovering
hydroponic growing operations
inside buildings, said the dis-
covery of the marijuana is sig-
nificant in a larger fight against
street violence.
Those involved with narcot-
ics, whether it is marijuana,
heroin or cocaine, purchase
firearms with their profits and
have shown they're willing to
use them to protect their busi-
ness, he said.

on ray the gay away
States should ban harmful 'conversion camps'
Last weekend, California Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill ban-
ning therapeutic programs aimed at converting the sexual
orientation of homosexual children. Many of these conver-
sion therapies are often sought by parents who suspect gay tenden-
cies in their children. The new law now prohibits any treatment that
asks minors to "change behaviors or gender expressions, or to elim-
inate or reduce sexual or romantic attractions or feelings toward
individuals of the same sex." Such therapies have been found to
have negative effects on children while promoting a culture of intol-
erance. Other states, including Michigan, should follow California's
lead in banning these prejudicial actions.

Major disrespect

OEasy, LS&plAy, B-School
pre-school. We've all heard
jokes and stereotypes about
various majors
before, and
maybe we've
even coined
some of our
own. But as stu-
dents at one of
the world's bestJ
universities,
why is it OK for HEMA
us to routinely KARUNA-
put down each K AM
other's concen-
trations?
It's no exaggeration that nearly
every major at the University is
highly ranked, and, as a result, no
student truly gets out easy. At one
point or another, everyone pulls
all-nighters in the library, spent
weeks obsessing over every detail
of a paper or been on the verge
of a breakdown while struggling
through a set of problems. And
yet, we hear our own voices rising,
mocking each other almost every
day. Program in the Environment
majors are tree-hugging hippies
who get to go camping for credit.
Screen Arts & Cultures majors just
watch movies for homework. Com-
puter Science majors have no social
skills because they spend all day
locked up coding in their rooms.
Pre-meds are neurotically com-
petitive, doing whatever it takes to
destroy the curve on organic chem-
istry exams.
I'm an Environmental Engineer-
ing major, and one might think
that stereotypes haven't developed
against us yet because the program
is so new. But in the one month since
we've been around, I've heard that
we're the engineering misfits - the
former civil engineers who found
building bridges too difficult.

In fact, we're all just trying to
make it through college and hope-
fully add value to society one day. It
doesn't seem acceptable to say that
one person's degree is worth more
than another's just because of their
major. At such a diverse school, the
focus should be on celebrating the
diversity of not just the students, but
also of their areas of study.
Take the case of Industrial and
Operations Engineering. There
certainly may be students who
elect this major because they
think - because of stereotypes like
"IOEasy" - it must require less
effort than most other engineering
majors. But, there are far more IOEs
who do it because they're genuinely
interested in the subject matter.
And it's no secret that students who
graduate from the University with
IOE degrees have starting salaries
that are much higher than many of
their peers. So it doesn't seem right
to stereotype students of a cer-
tain major simply because of their
shared passion or ambition.
Furthermore, what are we really
trying to prove by making jokes
about each other's majors? Almost
every student at the University is
here because they stood out in high
school. They were "special," and
that's why they ended up at a school
so prestigious. In an attempt to say
that perhaps we're still special,
we're still better, we still stand out,
we cling to the one thing that inher-
ently sets us apart from most of our
fellow students - our major. On
top of that, students pick up double
majors, multiple minors - whatever
it takes to distinguish themselves in
a sea of more than 40,000 students.
The University has asked us all
to "expect respect" through our
actions and words. While it may
initially seem harmless, bashing
someone's major is, ultimately,

a form of disrespect. We're not
achieving anything by telling busi-
ness students that their classes are
unnecessarily easy or engineering
students that theirs are unneces-
sarily hard. By stereotyping, we're
stereotyping ourselves as a bevy of
students with superiority complex-
es. The hallmark Michigan arro-
gance that other schools accuse us
of rears its ugly head each time we
put down someone else's major and,
by extension, flaunt our own.

S

Stereotypes
aside, no one
gets out of
the 'U' easy.

In the next few years, most of us
will leave Ann Arbor with a degree
in hand. And not just any degree,
but a University of Michigan degree
that's respected around the world.
The work it took to get this degree
was byno means "easy,"byno means
"playing," byno means "pre-school."
Regardless of what we studied, we'll
become a part of the largest alumni
network in the world. No matter
where in the world we end up, we'll
proudly bleed maize and blue for
the rest of our lives. What we stud-
ied here will probably matter as far
as what we end up doing - what we
thought of other people's majors, or
what they thought of ours, will mean
nothing. So next time you're inclined
to poke fun at someone's major,
think first.

A leading advocate of reparative thera-
pies is activist David Pickup, who credits
such practices with curing his own youth-
ful homosexual leanings. Pickup and others
often refer to a UCLA study conducted in the
1970s by doctoral student George Rekers. The
subject was Kirk Murphy, a slightly effemi-
nate 5-year-old boy. After subjecting Mur-
phy to experiments involving emotional and
physical punishments, Rekers concluded that
he was "cured" and published his findings in
a scientific journal. Rekers became regarded
as an expert in reparative therapies and even
today his research is cited in academic writ-
ings. Following the reparative treatment,
Murphy's mother recalled that, "it left Kirk
just totally stricken with the belief that he
was broken." In 2003, after years of living
"under a pall," Murphy committed suicide.
Concerned by his affection for dolls, Mur-
phy's parents forced him to attend the conver-
sion therapy program. At 5 years old, Murphy
was understandably compliant and unable to
voice his own thoughts. Similarly, most minors
are more or less subject to the whims of their
parents. California's ban provides protection
for underage children unable to defend them-
selves, while still allowing adults the freedom
to attend such therapy sessions voluntarily.
Pickup argues that the ban denies treat-
ment to children who may desire it. Regard-

less of his concern, there are questions about
the efficacy of the therapies themselves.
Reparative therapists have admitted that
while many "patients have succeeded in
reducing their homosexual attraction and in
enhancing heterosexual desire ... total 'cures'
are rare." Furthermore, a large portion of the
medical field agrees with the American Psy-
chological Association that "there has been
no scientifically adequate research to show
that therapy aimed at changing sexual orien-
tation is safe or effective."
In addition to their inefficacy, the APA says
conversion therapies may even "increase the
likelihood or severity of depression, anxi-
ety and self-destructive behavior." Unlike
other religious institutions such as private
schools, the sole purpose of a conversion cen-
ter is to cleanse the patient of homosexual-
ity. This not only causes direct harm to those
involved, but also spreads a visible message of
prejudice. Exodus International, for example,
is a religious organization with ministries
scattered across the country - including one
in Traverse City,-Mich. - dedicated to pro-
viding treatments to eradicate "homosexual
impulses and desires." The presence of these
clinics is a shameful indication of ignorance
and intolerance. Michigan, along with all
other states, should emulate the precedent
set by California.

SHARIK BASHIR I
A nation lost

Last week I was in a terrible mood. I was
following the reaction in Pakistan to the
provocative video, "Innocence of Muslims"
that ridicules the last prophet of Islam and
I was utterly dejected, buried beneath the
news stories depicting the chaos in my home-
town of Karachi. To make matters worse, my
father sent me a troubling e-mail. Our e-mail
exchanges typically consist of him asking me
about life in college, and me asking about the
situation at home and with the family. But for
the first time since I've been in college, the
tone was one of gloom. The first sentence per-
fectly set the tone - "yesterday was a bad day
for Pakistan's prestige, if there is any left."
As if my father's words weren't enough, I
went through the website of Pakistan's most
popular English newspaper and found that my
favorite writer, Nadeem F. Paracha, had writ-
ten a new piece titled "... And the abyss stared
back." Reading this sent me plummeting into
a temporary depression. He started his article
with, "it's official: We are not a nation.We are a
mob," and ended with, "We as a nation have for
long been staring into the abyss. But what many
ofus believe is avisionofsome kind ofa Muslim
reawakening is in actuality just the abyss star-
ing right back." The country went into a frenzy
bordering lunacy. The government completely
lost control of law and order in its main cities
and let mobs run amok.
A holiday was announced on Friday, Sept.
21 named Youm-i-Ishq-i-Rasool (Love for the
Prophet Day). Personally, I feel it's a ridicu-
lous public holiday to have. However, what
was supposed to be a day of expressing love
for the Prophet turned predictably violent.
Extremist outfits in the country used this as

an opportunity to flex their political muscle
and let indoctrinated sheep loose onto the
streets to set Karachi and other major cit-
ies ablaze. Cinemas were burned, protesters
fought with the police, many lives were lost
and many more people were injured. Prop-
erty was destroyed and set on fire.
According to The Express Tribune, a local
newspaper, the cost due to property damage
and frozen economic activity is estimated
at Rs 76 billion ($0.8 billion). I don't under-
stand the purpose of all this madness. Reli-
gious extremists promote their anti-West
propaganda, blaming the United States for a
video we clearly had nothing to do with. But
extremists tend to be immune to logic.
In his article, Paracha points out the dis-
turbing reality in Pakistan with a little his-
tory lesson. He points out how, for decades
since the birth of the nation, the writing has
been on the wall. Pakistan has been slipping
into the "abyss" of religious extremism, noth-
ing has been done to prevent it and each suc-
cessive government, democratic and military
alike, is a catalyst to the growing problem.
To me, the worst part about this disaster
is that it wasn't a turning point where Paki-
stanis at large realize that we strayed terri-
bly off the path. The crisis was not a wake-up
call (as if Pakistan really needs any more of
those). Friday, Sept. 21 was a day in Pakistan's
history that marks a point of no return. That
dreaded day that nobody wanted to admit
we've reached, where there is truly no hope.
Extremism has prevailed over mindfulness
and rationality. The country is lost.
Sharik Bashir is an LSA sophomore.

In a Freakonomics podcast from
November 2010, Steven Levitt,
along with other highly respected
economists, asserted that the U.S.
president has no control over the
economy. The president exercises
limited control over social issues -
he can't technically propose laws,
and he can't even vote on them.
The U.S. Constitution was written
to keep the executive branch from
being too powerful. This, in combi-
nation with the checks and balanc-
es system, was intended to prevent
tyranny. By extension, it gives the
president very little control, which
is a problem that's amplified by a
divided Congress.
According to an article from USA
Today, this term's Congress has
been the least productive since 1947.
They've passed onlyf61laws, whereas
every Congress before - with the
exception of Congress in 1995 - has
passed at least 125 laws. In the face
of this much opposition, there's little
the president can do.
Based on this evidence, the most
important role for the president is
to be the face of the country or of an
issue. When the president makes a
statement, it's immediately deemed
the most important statement made
about the issue in question. When
President Barack Obama and Vice
President Joe Biden came out (pun
intended) in favor of gay marriage, it
was seen as a huge victory for mar-
riage equality, even though Obama
cannot and has not proposed legisla-
tion supporting gay rights. In other
words, when the White House really
gets behind an issue, it immediately
gets pushed to the top of the public's
to-do list.
The president's role is one of
marketing and negotiating. Both
skills require the ability to speak
eloquently and diplomatically on
sensitive issues. When the president
says something, how he says it car-
ries significant weight. The presi-
dent must think before he speaks
and represent the country well
when he does, which simply isn't
the case with Mitt Romney in light
of numerous media gaffes.
This was underscored most
recently with his now-infamous

quote, "There are 47 percent of the
people who will vote for the presi-
dent no matter what. All right, there
are 47 percent who are with him,
who are dependent upon govern-
ment, who believe that they are vic-
tims ... And they will vote for this
president no matter what...These are
people who pay no income tax." And
that's only the tip of the iceberg.
In this speech, Romney alien-
ated hard working Americans in
the lower-middle class while trying
to appeal to his peers in the whit-
est, richest sector of society. How
this statement is viewed by other
countries and organizations would
be more important if Romney were
president. With Romney as the face
of our nation, this statement could
be taken to mean that America as a
whole only cares about the opinions
of the super-rich.
In London, Romney asserted that
with the 2012 Olympics, "It's hard to
know just how well it will turn out.
There are a few things that were dis-
concerting." He accused London of
being unequipped to host the games
a day before they were to start. Brit-
ain is one of the U.S.'s biggest allies
and it's tactless of Romney to have
angered its capital's residents in the
public forum. The would-be presi-
dent has to be more cognizant of the
force his words carry.
Romney also has had issues with
jumping the gun. He tends to speak
publicly on issues before he's aware
of all the facts. After the attacks on
U.S. ambassadors in Libya, Rom-
ney made a statement before Presi-
dent Obama had announced the
deaths. He criticized the Obama
administration for "stand[ing] by
a statement sympathizing with
those who breached our embassy in
Egypt, instead of condemning their
actions" and equated the move with
"an apology for America's values."
This was a matter of national secu-
rity in which only those close to the
administration knew all the facts.
It's irresponsible to make such a
statement without knowing all the
details. Romney has a rash, reac-
tive personality and responds too
quickly, without thought. The Libya
attacks are an example of the high-

ly sensitive issues he'll be dealing
with on a daily basis if he's elected
president. As President Obama said,
"Governor Romney seems to have a
tendency to shoot first and aim later.
And as president, one of the things
I've learned is you can't do that."
I'm not saying everything Rom-
ney says is stupid, nor am I saying a
Democrat has never said something
stupid. After all, it was Joe Biden
who once said, "'Jobs is a three-
letter word." Obama explained that
as small-town Americans "get bit-
ter, they cling to guns or religion or
antipathy to people who aren't like
them or anti-immigrant sentiment
or anti-trade sentiment as a way
to explain their frustrations." But
these examples are fewer and farther
between - Obama's statement comes
from last election. It also has less
global impact. Mitt Romney has been
in the public eye less than a year and
has already said things that are both
offensive and incorrect, or phrased in
the most terrible way possible.
Romney is a smart, extremely
successful man with degrees from
Harvard University, but this doesn't
mean he's able to express himself
eloquently. He's rash with his words
and thus makes speeches filled with
falsehoods, insults and tactlessness.
The president is the face of our
country. That's his or her most pow-
erful role. It took Mitt Romney one
trip to get the entire nation of Britain
to dislike him, and he didn't start a
war - he simply opened his mouth.
At this point in American history
we can't make enemies of any nation
militarily, economically or socially.
We need countries to work with us
to get through though these hard
economic times. The president needs
to be able to inspire not only their
own people, but also the citizens and
leaders of other countries. The presi-
dent's constitutional power is limit-
ed. The wayhe can get things done is
by convincing others through words
and influence. Regardless of his
platform, Mitt Romney's continual
media gaffes prove he can't be that
type of president.

Turkey strikes back after
Syria shells border town

Five civilians
killed in Turkey,
escalating tensions
BEIRUT (AP) - Turkish
artillery fired on Syrian tar-
gets Wednesday after shelling
from Syria struck a border vil-
lage in Turkey, killing five civil-
ians, sharply escalating tensions
between the two neighbors and
prompting NATO to convene an
emergency meeting.
"Our armed forces at the bor-
der region responded to this
atrocious attack with artillery
fire on points in Syria that were
detected with radar, in line with
the rules of engagement," the
Turkish government said in a
statement from the prime minis-
ter's office.
The artillery fire capped a day
that began with four bombs tear-
ing through a government-held
district in Syria's commercial
and cultural capital of Aleppo,
killing more than 30 people and
reducing buildings to rubble.
Along the volatile border,
a shell fired from inside Syria
landed on a home in the Turk-
ish village of Akcakale, killing a
woman, her three daughters and
another woman, and wounding
at least 10 others, according to
Turkish media.
The shelling appeared to
come from forces loyal to Syrian
President Bashar Assad's regime,
which is fighting rebels backed

by Turkey in an escalating civil
war.
"Turkey, acting within the
rules of engagement and interna-
tionallaws,willneverleaveunre-
ciprocated such provocations by
the Syrian regime against our
national security," the office of
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip
Erdogan said in a statement.
Turkish media said Turkey
has prepared a parliamentary
bill for Syria that is similar to
one that authorizes the Turkish
military to intervene in northern
Iraq in pursuit of Kurdish mili-
tants who have bases there. The
bill is expected to be discussed in
parliament on Thursday, Anado-
lu agency reported.
If approved, the bill could
more easily open the way to uni-
lateral action by Turkey's armed
forces inside Syria, without the
involvement of its Western and
Arab allies.
Secretary of State Hillary Rod-
ham Clinton said the U.S. was
"outraged that the Syrians have
been shooting across the border,"
addingthat she would speak with
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet
Davutoglu on the matter.
"It's a very, very dangerous
situation," Clinton said. "And all
responsible nations need to band
together to persuade the Assad
regime to have a cease-fire, quit
assaulting their own people and
begin the process of a political
transition."
NATO's National Atlantic
Council, which is composed of

the alliance's ambassadors, held
an emergency meeting in Brus-
selsWednesdaynight at Turkey's
request to discuss the cross-bor-
der incident.
The meeting ended with a
statement strongly condemning
the attack and saying: "The alli-
ance continues to stand by Tur-
key and demands the immediate
cessation of such aggressive acts
against an ally." It also urged the
Syrian regime to "put an end to
flagrant violations of interna-
tional law."
NATO also held an emergency
meeting when a Turkish jet was
shot down by Syria in June, kill-
ing two pilots.
Turkey wants to avoid going
into Syria on its own. It has been
pushing for international inter-
vention in the form of a safe
zone, which would likely entail
foreign security forces on the
ground and a partial no-fly zone.
However, the allies fear military
intervention in Syria could ignite
a wider conflict, and few observ-
ers expect robust action from
the United States, which Turkey
views as vital to any operation in
Syria, ahead of the presidential
election in November.
According to Turkey's NTV
station, the Syrian information
ministry said it had launched an
investigation into Wednesday's
shelling and expressed sorrow
for the deaths of Turkish civil-
ians. But it urged Turkey to pre-
vent the cross-border infiltration
of what it called terrorists.

Rial has lot more
than a third of its
value in one week
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) - Ira-
nian authorities used aggres-
sive measures Wednesday in an
attempt to halt the nosedive of
the country's currency, mak-
ing arrests, vowing to stamp out
sidewalk money changers and
warning merchants against fuel-
ing the mounting public anger
over the economy.
There were unconfirmed
reports of sporadic violence.
Associated Press photos showed
riot police blocking a street with
the charred hulks of a garbage
can and a motorcycle that had
been set on fire. Smoke was ris-
ing from the area in central Teh-
ran near the main bazaar.
The sweeping responses to
the freefall of the rial - which
has lost more than a third of its
value in a week - underscored
the worries for Iranian leaders
after months of dismissing the
West's economic squeeze seek-
ing to rein in Tehran's nuclear
program. A declining currency
causes shifts in an economy such
as making imported goods more
expensive.
Although the currency cri-
sis is blamed on a combination

of factors - including internal
government policies - the rush
to dump rials appears to reflect
an underlying perception that
international sanctions have
deepened problems such as run-
away inflation and soaring pric-
es for imports and that the only
safe hedge is to grab dollars or
euros.
If the economic turmoil
intensifies, it could boost pres-
sure on the ruling system before
elections next June to pick Presi-
dent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's
successor. That has the potential
to hinder nuclear talks with the
West until after the elections.
One of Ahmadinejad's main
critics, parliament speaker Ali
Larijani, has led the calls to
blame the currency crisis mostly
on allegedly misguided govern-
ment monetary policies.
In reply, Ahmadinejad
warned that he could consider
resigning if his government is
put under too much pressure.
"Now is not the time for any-
body to settle accounts," Ahma-
dinejad said Tuesday as the rial
hit a record low. "If my presence
is a burden on you, (the solution
is for me to) write one line to say
goodbye."
Tuesday's rate of 35,500 rials
againstthe U.S. dollar compared
with 24,000 a week ago on the
unofficial street trading rate,

which is widely followed in Iran.
It was close to 10,000 rials for $1
as recently as early 2011.
Exchange houses were closed
Wednesday, and currency web-
sites were blocked from provid-
ingupdates onthe latest rates.
Public grumbling has grown
steadily louder over a punishing
combination of a falling curren-
cy and rising prices, which have
put some staples such as chicken
and lamb out of reach of many
low-income Iranians. Earlier
this week, a petition signed by
about 10,000 workers was sent
to the labor minister to com-
plain that even paying rents has
become a struggle.
The owner of a furniture
showroom said he hasn't made
a sale in 10 days while his work-
shop rent has been increased by
30 percent. He said one of his
workers bought a can of tuna for
lunch Saturday for 35,000 rials,
or about 98 cents at the current
exchange rate. The next day it
was 45,000 rials, or $1.26, said
Hamid, who gave only his first
name because of warnings by
Iranian officials not to discuss
the economic situation with the
media.
"Even Afghan workers are
going home since it doesn't
make sense to work in Iran
with a currency that's worth
less and less," he said.


Godbee is second straight Detroit
police chief to face sex scandal

zona, lease after a news conference.
Authorities face tough territory in
border probe after agent shooting

Investigation
ordered to decide
fate of chief
DETROIT (AP) - Detroit
Mayor Dave Bing was elected
to replace a scandal-plagued
predecessor after promis-
ing to clamp down on crime.
But following allegations of a
sex scandal involving another
police chief, he's having trouble
stabilizing the department, let
alone the streets.
Bing suspended Police Chief
Ralph Godbee, 44, after a sub-
ordinate, a 37-year-old internal
affairs officer, claimed the two
had engaged in a sexual rela-
tionship for about a year.
The mayor hired Godbee
two years ago after firing his
predecessor, in part because of
similar charges involving a sub-
ordinate. Bing knew at the time
that Godbee previously had a
romantic relationship with the
same woman, a police lieuten-
ant.
Should Bing's investigation
conclude that Godbee too must
go, the city would be forced
to seek its fifth police chief in
four years. In Bing's three-plus
years in office, he already has
fired two chiefs.
"He's had more people
resign, fired, quit than any
other mayor that I know of,"
Councilman Kwame Kenyatta
said Wednesday. "It either says
he chooses the wrong people or
doesn't know how to choose the
right people."
Like many police depart-
ments, Detroit's force is under
severe financial constraints.
The city has about 2,700 offi-
cers, down from 4,000 a decade
ago.

The department reports
most violent crimes numbers
are down this year, but the city
also is on track to eclipse last
year's 344 murders. Robberies
at gas stations and convenience
stores, including the assault
and carjacking of a prominent
church pastor earlier this year,
are becoming more violent and
brazen.
"The officers are working
24/7 and aren't being treated
well," said Oakland County
Commissioner William Dwyer,
a former Detroit police official.
"They've taken dramatic cuts
in salaries and benefits. They
are in the most dangerous city
right now in the U.S. If you
expect them to perform, you
ought to treat them like profes-
sionals and not second-class
citizens."
Even before the alleged
scandal came to light, Bing and
Godbee have been at odds with
officers over a 10 percent pay
cut, requirements that they pay
more for health care and new
rules requiring 12-hour work
days.
Earlier this year, the chief
reduced staffing inside police
precincts to get more officers
on the city's crime-plagued
streets.
"The more immediate issue
facing people in Detroit are
the screaming headlines about
the number of people shot or
injured, and the fact that the
number seems to be on the
increase as opposed to the
decrease," said Sheila Cock-
rel, a political analyst and for-
mer Detroit councilwoman.
"Detroiters are going to want
a police chief focusing on those
issues and not what's happen-
ing in his personal life."
Angelica Robinson, the

internal affairs officer who
says she had a relationship
with Godbee, posted on Twit-
ter a photo of herself with her
service weapon in her mouth,
her attorney David Robinson
said. She had learned Godbee
was at a weekend police con-
ference with another woman,
said the attorney, who is not
related to Angelica Robinson.
He said Godbee had other
officers locate her and put her
under surveillance. She has
since been reassigned from
internal affairs to other duties
and does not have use of her
service weapon, David Robin-
son said.
On Tuesday, Bing said in a
statement that he suspended
Godbee for 30 days from his
$140,400-a-year post "pending
a full and thorough investiga-
tion of this matter."
Assistant Chief Chester
Logan has assumed Godbee's
responsibilities during the sus-
pension.
Godbee, returning to Detroit
after attending a police confer-
ence out of state, told reporters
Wednesday evening at Detroit
Metropolitan Airport that he
could not comment on Angel-
ica Robinson's claims or his
suspension.
Bing has spent much of his
first term as mayor cleaning
up the fiscal mess and $300
million budget deficit left by
ex-mayor and convicted felon
Kwame Kilpatrick. He's also
changed the perception of a
City Hall warped by public
corruption.
However, his handling of the
police department has been
spotty, Kenyatta said, pointing
to the firing of ex-chief War-
ren Evans that led to Godbee
getting the job.

Rural Arizona
desert heavily used
by drug smugglers
PHOENIX (AP) - Investiga-
tors searching a stretch of the
U.S.-Mexico border for clues into
the fatal shooting of a Border
Patrol agent face a treacherous
territory that is heavily used by
drug smugglers, offers many hid-
ing places and is close enough to
Mexico for traffickers to make a
quick getaway.
Whoever killed Agent Nicholas
Ivie and wounded another agent
in the sparsely populated desert
in southeastern Arizona early
Tuesday may have done just that.
Those who carried out the
shooting near Bisbee, Ariz., prob-
ably had time to cross the border
in the early-morning darkness
before authorities could seal off
an escape route, said George
McCubbin, president of the
National Border Patrol Council, a
union representing about 17,000
border patrol agents.
"I seriously doubt anybody
would be laid up and hiding," he
said.
Ivie and two other agents were
fired upon in a rugged hilly area
about five miles north of the bor-
der as they responded to an alarm
that was triggered on one of the
sensors that the government has
installed along the border. The
wounded agent was shot in the
ankle and buttocks and released
from the hospital after under-
going surgery. The third agent
wasn't injured.
Ivie was a 30-year-old father of
two who grew up in Utah and was
active in the Mormon church. He
was an agent for four years.

Authorities have declined to
provide other details, including
what they believe prompted the
shooting and whether the agents
were ambushed. Still, they sus-
pect that more than one person
fired on the agents. No arrests
have been made.
The last Border Patrol agent
fatally shot on duty was Brian
Terry, who died in a shootout
with bandits near the border in
December 2010. Terry's shoot-

ing was later linked to the gov-
ernment's "Fast and Furious
gun-smuggling operation, which
allowed people suspected of ille-
gally buying guns for others to
walk away from gun shops with
weapons, rather than be arrested.
Authorities intended to track
the guns into Mexico. Two rifles
found at the scene of Terry's
shooting were bought by a mem-
ber of the gun-smuggling ring
being investigated.

Bolender out at ITA All-
American tournament

By ERIN LENNON
For theDaily
Two Wolverines will rep-
resent the Michigan women's
tennis team at the ITA All-
American Championships this
week in Pacific Palisades, Calif.
Junior Brooke Bolender fell
to No. 74 Alejandra Granillo of
Pepperdine in the qualifying
round on Tuesday afternoon.
Despite taking the first set in
a tiebreaker, a lack of balance
in key points meant a failure
to qualify for the main draw.
Bolender would later drop both
sets, 6-2, 6-3, in her consolation
match against No., 76 Samantha
Adams of Texas Tech.
"It was just one of those days
where she wasn't feeling over-
all great on the tennis court,"
said Michigan coach Ronnie
Bernstein. "She's been great
for us both in doubles and in
singles. We're going to continue

to work hard in the fall, and I
expect her to be a huge part of
our success this year."
Sophomore Emina Betkas,
the No. 9 singles seed, will also
compete in the singles main
draw through the rest of the
week. The championship match
is set to take place Saturday at
3:30 p.m.
Despite little play over the
summer, coach Bernstein
expects good things from Bet-
kas.
"A lot depends on the draw. If
she serves well and plays with
confidence, she can go really far
in the tournament."
The tournament scoring
has no reflection on the team's
record and won't affect Michi-
gan's current standing as the
Big Ten leader. Instead, indi-
vidual matches will contribute
to rankings for both Bolender
and Betkas and could set them
up to qualify for the NCAA

tournament in May. Competing
against some of the best play-
ers in the country in similar
tournaments will give the girls
confidence, according to coach
Berinstein.
As the fifth-ranked pair in
the tournament, Bolender and
Bektas will face high caliber
competition in the main draw
of doubles beginning Thursday
afternoon.
The duo won its only match
Saturday at the Wolverine Invi-
tational.
"The thing about them is that
they can really beat anybody in
the country," Bernstein said,
"They just have to play with
that consistency."
Events like the All-American
Championship will prepare
the women for events like the
Roberta Allison Fall Classic
and ITA Regionals. The Fall
Classic opens this Saturday in
Tuscaloosa, Ala.

By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan volleyball
team's skid againstranked oppo-
nents continued Wednesday as
Michigan lost its third straight
match against teams in the top
25. In its third straight road
match, the
MICHIGAN 1
Wolverines MINNESOTA 3
struggled
against No. 10 Minnesota, and
Michigan fell in four sets, 13-25,
20-25, 25-23, 22-25.
Michigan (2-3 Big Ten, 15-4
Overall) had three players in
double figures in digs, led by
freshman defensive specialist
Tiffany Morales, but it couldn't
match the four Golden Gophers,
who had double digit kills. Soph-
omore setter Lexi Dannemi-
ller and junior outside hitter
Lexi Erwin, who both recorded
double-doubles, also helped the
Wolverines.

Statistically, Michigan's first
set was its worst of the season,
with a season low 13 points. The
Wolverines earned 11 kills and
finished with a.276 kill percent-
age in the set, but their defense
fell against the Golden Gophers'
(4-1, 13-3) game-high .519 kill
percentage and 15 kills.
In the second set, the Wol-
verines were more successful
in stopping Minnesota, holding
them to a .333 kill percentage,
but this time it was their offense
that held them back. Michigan
hit for a .179 kill percentage
and 10 kills. The Wolverines'
improved play in the second set
was led by Dannemiller's nine
assists to go along with Erwin's
four kills.
Michigan finally found its
groove in the third set. Running
out to a 4-1 lead, Dannemiller's
12 assists and two kills, and the
defensive stand all helped the
Wolverines steal the third set.

At first it looked as though
Michigan was going to run away
with the set after taking a 19-14
lead, but the Golden Gophers
went on a run to take the lead
21-20. From there, Dannemi-
ller had five straight assists and
helped take the set. The Wolver-
ines finished with a .318 hitting
percentage and held Minnesota
to a .255 hitting percentage,
In the fourth set Minnesota
and Michigan exchanged points
for the first half of the set until
the Golden Gophers pulled
away at 24-20. The Wolverines
were able to hold off two match
points, but couldn't hold on, fall-
ing 25-22.
Michigan is now just 1-3
against ranked opponents this
year. The Wolverines beat No. 25
Northern Illinois earlier in Sep-
tember, but they suffered con-
secutive losses to No. 17 Purdue
and No. 6 Nebraska before the
loss to Minnesota.

Junior Brooke Bolender couldn't find balance in key points after winning the first set in a tiebreaker.

When not ordering sprints,
Roundtree works on timing

Eye injury sidelines
goaltender Rutledge

By BEN ESTES
Daily Sports Editor
Nobody was too worried
when Roy Roundtree was forced
to miss most of fall camp after
undergoing knee surgery. The
fifth-year senior wide receiver
was back in time for the season
opener against Alabama and
, hasn't missed time since.
But while Roundtree out-
wardly showed no signs that the
knee still bothered him - and he
insisted as much - he failed to
make an impact until Michigan's
most recent game against Notre
Dame two weeks ago. After total-
ing five receptions for 42 yards
in the team's first three games,
Roundtree had three catches for
30 yards against the Fighting
Irish.
Part of the receiver's new-
found success, if modest, can
be explained by offensive coor-
dinator Al Borges moving him
around on the field. That allowed
Roundtree to keep the defense
guessing and exploit different
matchups.
But Roundtree also revealed
on Wednesday that while his
knee had healed fine, the injury
hurt his conditioning to the point
that he wasn't in ideal shape
over the season's first few weeks.
The time he's had since then has
allowed him to build his stamina
back up, and he said he's now
almost as well conditioned as he
was before hurting his knee.
For Roundtree, the correlation
between his stamina and his per-
formance against Notre Dame is
obvious.
"Oh yeah," Roundtree said.
"I'm pretty sure (Borges) cut
back on me a little bit because of
my knee, but rve played a couple
games (now), and he's getting me
back into my rhythm."
It's a development that should
only continue to pay dividends,
given how Roundtree spent his
bye week. He used the extra time
to catch up on his conditioning,
instructing the strength and
conditioning coaches to give him
more running.
That manifested itself in the
form of half-gassers - sprints
across the width of the field and
back - and 100-yard sprints,
according to the receiver. But
Roundtree also got in better

shape thanks to the running
program that he instituted in
practice last week for the wide
receivers.
For every "loaf" that a receiver
incurs - that is, every time one
of them is caught not hustling
all the way through a rep - the
whole position group has to
run a gasser after practice ends.
(Roundtree claims he enjoys the
sprints, but has made sure not to
pick up any loafs for the sake of
his teammates.)
The new system came wholly
at Roundtree's direction - Mich-
igan coach Brady Hoke confirmed
that he had no part in its formu-
lation. The senior wide receiv-
ers from a year ago had the same
program inplace last season, and
Roundtree, the newsenior leader,
felt inspired to reinstitute it after
he was unsatisfied with how his
position group was performing.
"It kind of showed through
(game) film, guys not hustling
off the ball, including myself,"
Roundtree said. "I feel like it's
going to help us more. ... Even
though it's going to be hard in
practice because you get so many
reps, in a game you'll just be used
to it. I feel like I had to do that
because seeing it on film, man, it

was terrible."
Hoke said he couldn't speak to
whether Roundtree's condition-
ing is truly as improved as the
receiver says, but the coach did
say that Roundtree's move to hold
the wide receivers more account-
able is just par for the course.
"His leadership, and that's
really been since day one as a
junior, that's one reason that
he's in the jersey he's in," Hoke
said. "He's been a guy who you
can count on any time, whether
it be on special teams, whether
it be (on) a team run, whatever
it might be. Roy's leadership and
his commitment to his team-
mates, those are things that stick
out to me."
* The receivers also spent addi-
tional time after practice getting
more reps in, something that
could prove just as beneficial to
an offense coming off a six-turn-
over night against Notre Dame.
Roundtree said the biggest
facet thatthe passinggame needs
to improve this week against
Purdue is its timing and anyone
that watched the game against
the Fighting Irish would have to
agree with the wide receiver.
He attributed part of the
issues to senior quarterback

Denard Robinson having to rush
his throws because of pressure.
That, in turn, led to the receiv-
ers having to rush their routes,
which made for a less than ideal,
combination.
But Roundtree was confident
that the extra reps during the
bye week will help mitigate those.
issues. And he also reported that
Robinson had "moved past" his
post-Notre Dame blues, which
Roundtree said was the most
down he had ever seen his quar-
terback.
"Seeing him the next day, he
didn't feel too bad because he
let it go," Roundtree said. "He
got over it. It's college football, it
happens.
"I might drop 10 catches, but I"
can't be frustrated, because it'll
mess me up for the rest of the sea-
son. Short-term memory, so he'll
be good."
With that, Roundtree had fin-
ished his explanation of why the

Wrestling a birthright for the Churella family

By LIZ NAGLE
Daily Sports Writer
The Churella name has grown
into a legacy that is stenciled
across the banners of Cliff Keen
Arena and along the walls of the
Bahna Wrestling Center.
Former Michigan wrestler
Mark Churella Sr. beganthe mak-
ings of that birthright from 1976-
79, claiming a trio of national
titles at the 150 and 167 lb. weight
classes.
Regarded as one of the most
decorated wrestlers in program
history, the four-time All-Amer-
ican boasts a 22-1 record at the
NCAA Championships and led
the Wolverines to four-straight
top-10 finishes.
Churella captured a pair of Big
Ten Championship crowns en
route to finishing his career with
a 132-13 record. The Farmington
Hills, Mich. native accomplished
numerous feats on the mat and
was inducted to the National
Wrestling Hall of Fame in 1999.
But his efforts continued beyond
the blown whistle.
With a multitude of recogni-
tions and achievements behind
him, Churella began to build the
base of something not yet defined
that would one day be passed on
to the next generation.
The Letterwinners M Club
announced on Sept. 24 that
Churella as this year's Ufer Award
winner. Since 1981, the accolade
has been given to individuals
that have exhibited "outstanding
service" to the Michigan Ath-
letic Department. Past recipients
include Bo Shembechler (1994),
Red Berenson (1998) and Ron
Kramer (2004).
"I feel very privileged -
it's quite an esteemed- group,"
Churella said. "I think after
looking at that list of people that

1-0.
Metcalf claimed the first-peri-
od on a single-leg takedown, and
Josh rebounded in the second,
dropping the former Hawkeye to
his back.
A somewhat controversial
call in the third, however, stifled
Josh's Olympic berth when the
mat judge awarded him a point
that was ultimately overturned
by both tables.
"Itwasthe heartbreakingloss,"
Joshr told the wrestling website
Flowrestling after his final match
of the Trials. "I trained four years
for this moment, this opportunity
and I thought I was winning with
30 seconds left."
Nevertheless, Josh bounced
back and tallied two more veins in
the wrestlebacks over Adam Hall
and Chase Pami.
"The whole goal is to.be on the
Olympic team, Josh said. "But
once that falls short, you stop
feeling bad for yourself and pick it
up real quick and come back and,
take third."
Though Josh put ahiatus on his
career, it seems there's something
he's not ready to part with. On
July 10, the Athletic Department
announced that Josh would join
the Wolverines' coaching staff,
a transition that Mark Churella
said his son made rather quickly.
"As of now; I'm taking some
time off of competition, but we'll
see what happens in the near
future," Josh said. "I'm definitely
focusing more energy on the guys
now."
Mark Churella may have laid
the foundation for his sons to fol-
low, but Josh has only strength-
ened the family name that hangs
on the banners on Cliff Keen.
"My sons have demonstrated
something I've been very proud
of," Churella said. "It's a legacy of
a combination oflessonslearned."

Former Michigan wrestler Josh Churella (right) finished third at the 2012 U.S. Olympic Team Trials, narrowly missing an Olympic berth ona controversial call.

they've honored in the past that
maybe there was a mistake."
Churella coached the Wolver-
ines in a couple of short stints,
until family matters became a
time-consuming priority. After
his father suffered a heart attack,
Churella was left with "double
duty" responsibilities between
his coaching position and the
family-founded FDI Group insur-
ance agency. Though he ultimate-
ly chose to invest his energy into
the growth of the company, the
elder Churella paved the way for

his three sons - Mark Jr., Ryan for six All-American honors, four
and Josh. The legacy continued conference titles and a 241-29

cussed.
t Michael Heaney, an assistant
professor of political science,
said that of the topics the candi-
dates discussed, Romney seemed
more aggressive and more elo-
quent than Obama. He added that
Obama was often "straight down
the middle," whereas Romney
took risks that sometimes paid off
and other times came off as "com-
pletely stupid."
"Romney's a stronger debater,
and in a lot of ways I think that
Romney is a stronger speaker,"
Heaney said. "Overall, he comes
across as stronger."

"Many of (the junior faculty)
have used the study that they
did with us to go on to much
bigger studies that made a sig-
nificant impact in the areas of
cancer and Alzheimer's disease
and mobility," Lichtenberg said.
James Jackson, the MCU-
AAAR co-director and a Uni-
versity psychology professor,
said the renewed grant will
allow the center to train about
15 more junior scholars.
Jackson noted that training
the younger generation is cru-
cial as the baby boom generation
ages and general life expectancy
increases. As 2030 approaches,
there will be fewer people under
the age of 15 than there are over
the age of 60, Jackson added.

"Our long term focus has been
on training the next generation
of researchers interested in the
nature of aging and aging-relat-
ed phenomena among diverse
groups of elders," Jackson said.
"This has become even more
critical over the last 15 years."
Lichtenberg added that the
University of Michigan and
Wayne State workwell together
in mentoring scholars and con-
ducting studies.
"It's a very unique and excep-
tional partnership between two
universities," Lichtenberg said.
"That doesn't always happen. as
well as it has happened between
The University of Michigan and
Wayne State. I give Dr. Jackson
a lot of credit for that."

For McCormack, her daycon-
tinues with a procession of driv-
ing the kids to their respective
responsibilities - - water polo
practice, high school, middle
school - before settling in
for another day of work at the,
University's Law School. In
between meetings and during
the evening, she works on her
campaign.
"Most evenings I do stuff for
the campaign; most days I'm
generally at the Law School,"
McCormack said. "(If) I have
a lunchtime event or an early
morning event I will run to
that, but otherwise I'mtryingto
teach my classes, supervise my
students and run my programs."
Though they're apart during
the week, Croley said family
time is very important to him

and his wife.
"We just try to save a lit-
tle time for the kids," Croley
said. "Even though at their age
they're all busy with their'inde-
pendent things, we make a point
to try to do something as a fam-
ily each weekend."
Both McCormack and Croley
said their children are staunch
supporters of their careers.
"I think our kids have found
it interesting and exciting,"
McCormack said. "And they're
pretty involved in the world
anyway, so I think they are
proud of us, actually."
McCormack and Croley's
involvement in politics has not
gone without a few perks for the
kids, who have eaten meals at the
White House and hung out with
Bo, the Obama family's Portu-
guese Water Dog.,
"One of the things I've tried to
do is make this a family project
to a certain extent, giving them
some sense of ownership in it,"

Croley said.
Both McCormack and Croley
face significant life changes in
the near future, with Election
Day just over a month away. If
McCormack is elected, she will
be forced to resign from her
position as associate dean due
to potential conflicts of inter-
est if the University were to
have a case before the Michi-
gan Supreme Court. Croley
will return to the University to
resume his professorship later
this month,
Though it may be difficult to
manage a family, a campaign and
afull-time job, McCormacknoted
that her busy'schedule will soon
subside as the election ends.
For now, Croley said the fam-
ily is just enjoying their time
together.
"It's challenging ... it has its
moments, (but) we seem to man-
age okay," Croley said. "We have
found a family rhythm for it,
found away to make it."

a "slight narrowing" of Obama's
lead in the polls. He predicted
that by Friday, the polls might
record Romney's disadvantage to
-be about 2.5 percent, as opposed
to the 3.5 percent it was before the
debate in several polls.
While Heaney said Romney
might gain a new constituency of
swing voters, most students at the
watch party said they were not
swayed by either candidate's per-
formance.
Zingers and one-line put-
downs from each candidate
earned applause and laughs from
the audience of 266 students in
Annenberg Auditorium at the
Ford School of Public Policy, com-
prising the largest watch party on
campus Wednesday night, accord-
ing to the event's organizers.
LSA freshman Sara Isaac, who
attended the debate after being
encourages by her political sci-
ence professor, said she thought
oftentimes the candidates labored
over minor points or statistics.
"A lot of it was just very repeti-
tive," Isaac said in an interview
after the debate. "They would
attack the same issue. They kept
going back to the same issue."
The complaint was the same
for Public Policy graduate student
Nick Johnson, who said he was
surprised that Obama was able to
put Romney on the defensive, but
disappointed in the inconsistent
nnrfn..ann c htb an --m--

"Too much of the debate was
just arguing about the facts,"
he said, pointing to Romney's
insistence that Obama would cut
$716 billion from Medicare and
Obama's subsequent denial. "It
was just fact-throwing."
Johnson also expressed dismay
that the debate offered few memo-
rable moments.
"Obamalackedenergythrough-
out the debate," he said. "He just
wasn't very polished. Romney was
more polished but didn't provide
specifics, and I don't think that
Obama capitalized on (that)."
At awatch party for the Under-
graduate Political Science Asso-
ciation in Palmer Commons,
students said they were equally
unenthused with the candidates's
showings.
LSA junior Erik Hanson said
neither Obama nor Romney dis-
tinguished himself, adding that
he felt that both performances
were merely average.
"I think both (candidates) are
doing an okay job," he said. "Nei-
ther of them seem completely
great."
LSA freshman Lauren Dahar,
however, said she thought Rom-
ney outperformed her expecta-
tions.
"I'm impressed with how put
together Romney is," she said.
"I'm a Romney supporter and I
thought he was going to crash and

CITIZENSHIP
From Page 1A
citizens, demographics that have
historically favored Democratic
candidates.
Political Science Prof. Vincent
Hutchings said opponents of the
citizenship checkbox are fight-
ing Michigan legislation with
similar logic.
"I think there is a perception
that this is not an innocuous act
... that it's an effort to try to dis-
courage people - to intimidate
them from voting," Hutchings
said.
While Hutchings was reluc-
tant to accuse Johnson. of
attempting to disenfranchise
certain voting blocs, he said sim-
ilar voting laws passed in other
states have had clear political
aims not relating to voter fraud

prevention, which he noted is a
nominal issue nationwide.
"I can say, speaking more
broadly again, that these poli-
cies are disproportionately and
overwhelmingly pursued by
Republicans ... and it seems per-
fectly reasonable to presume
that at least some of them ... are
motivated by desire to discour-
age voters," he said.
In response to accusations
regarding Johnson's motive,
Gendreau said she is simply com-
mitted to upholding the integrity
of the voting system.
"Anyone who is making claims
of disenfranchisement is mis-
leading voters," Gendreau said.
Michigan passed legislation
that requires voters to show ID
at the polls in 2007, but the law
allows citizens to sign an affida-
vit if they are unable to provide
appropriate ID. Gendreau said

the law, which was in effect for
the 2008 presidential election,
did not appear to disenfranchise
voters, recalling that Michigan
reported record votingturnout.
She added that until 2008,
federal law required all Secre-
tary of State clerks to ask cus-
tomers if they wished to register
to vote, regardless of their citi-
zenship status. While the law
has since been modified, the Sec-
retary of State's office estimates
that about 4,000 non-citizens
are still registered from prior to
2008.
"If you are a non-citizen and
you vote, it's a felony," Gendreau
said. "You can be deported. You
can also have troubles becom-
ing a citizen even if you're not
deported. So it's a huge incon-
venience and a huge problem for
anyone who does vote who isn't a
qualified voter."

RATS
From Page 1A
from the rats, before the crew
sent the chemicals to Mabrouk
to conduct measurements and
analysis.
"You insert a small, painless
probe into (the rat's) brain areaof
interest and what the probe does
is collect the chemicals floating
around in that brain area," DiFe-
liceantonio said.
She said the study was pri-
marily conducted in three parts,
the first involved observing rats
in their natural environment,
carrying out daily activities like
chewing toys or eating, and then
introducing them to M&Ms.
The researchers found the rats
experienced an increase in a
particular type of endorphin, a
chemical produced in-the brain
that responds to a variety ofstim-
uli like excitement and pain.
"We gave (rats) access to
M&Ms," DiFeliceantonio said.
"They could eat as many as they
wanted, and as they started
eating the M&Ms, you saw an
increase in activity in a neu-
rotransmitter called enkephalin."
According to DiFeliceantonio,
enkephalin is an opioid peptide,
which is involved in the intake
of high-sugar and high-fat foods.
She said the second prominent
step in the study, after assessing

that the increased enkephalin
present during M&M-eating was
what made the rats want to eat
M&Ms, was then microinjecting
synthetic enkephalin into the
rats' brains.
"We wanted to know if this
enkephalin surge was causal in
any way," DiFeliceantonio said.
"So you have to manipulate the
brain and look at the behavior."
The idea was that if the syn-
thetic enkephalin caused the
rats to want to eat M&Ms, then it
could be identified as akey factor
in the brain's cravings for high-
fat and high-sugar foods.
"What we saw is that the rats
doubled their intake of M&Ms
(with the synthetic enkepha-
lin)," DiFeliceantonio said.
She explained, however, that
the second step wasn't conclu-
sive enough to convince the
team that it had reached their
goal.
Still, the third part of the
study yielded comprehensive
results after they tested if the
synthetic enkephalin made the
rats think the M&Ms tasted bet-
ter, or if it truly caused the brain
to make the rat eat more, regard-
less of taste.
DiFeliceantonio said they
analyzed the rats' facial expres-
sions to see if they enjoyed the
M&Ms more when microinject-
ed with synthetic enkephalin.
She noted that when provided

with the option to eat regular
lab "chow," chew on toys or eat
M&Ms, the rats consistently
chose M&Ms.
"We found that (synthetic
enkephalin) was increasing
their motivation to eat, but not
the deliciousness of the M&M,"
DiFeliceantonio said.
overall, she said t ostudy
showed definitive enough
information to write the"study
showcasing the discovery of
enkephalin in triggering the
desire to eat junk food.
Mabrouk, who handled the
chemical measurements for
DiFeliceantonio's study, said
Kennedy's lab is one of the "pre-
miere" labs in the world capable
of performing the minuscule
measurements required for the
study.
"We have very collaborative
spirits here," he said. "A lot of
labs know we have this technol-
ogy that is very powerful when
you apply it to questions in neu-
roscience."
Mabrouk said the combina-
tion of interesting problems and
the lab's skillful measuring abili-
ties has provided the opportuni-
ty to yield "high-impact" results.
"We collaborate with tons of
people and it is, in a way, fostered
by the University," he said. "We
can do these match-ups of differ-
ent techniques and the outcomes
are these really cool findings."

ARTS RECOMMENDS
In this feature, Daily Arts writers will give their endorsements
for the arts you need to experience to help you deal with current events.
"The Tiger's Wife"
' EGTea Obreht was only 26 years old when she
won the Orange Prize for Fiction for her debut
novel "The Tiger's Wife." Her prose, however, has
the wisdom and richness of a writer three times
W I FE her age. The novel follows a young doctor in an
unnamed Balkan country who investigates the
mystery surrounding her grandfather's sudden
death. Obreht weaves the real with the fantastical,
RANDOM HOUSE painting a beautiful story of family and folklore.
Presidents of the United States of
America
If the rapidly approaching election makes you
nervous, listen to the self-titled album from the
Presidents of the United States of America. With
songs dedicated to cats, peaches and spiders driv-
ing dune buggies, the 1995 album is nonsensical
but a classic - not to mention a nice change from
the heated political climate out there. If only real
TOOTH & NAIL presidents could be so carefree.
"The Snowtown Murders"
If you're in the mood for a movie experience
punctuated by the most WTF moments that can
possibly be squeezed into a two-hour period, look
no further than "The Snowtown Murders." The
powerful Australian crime-thriller chronicles the
exploits of notorious serial killer John Bunting and
is guaranteed to have the bravest souls looking
away from the screen in moments of pure psycho-
FC MIDNIGHT logical and physical disgust.
"Battlestar Galactica"
If you've never watched the sci-fi sensation, what
the frak are you doing? It blends political intrigue,
soap, mysticism and wartime thrills, and explores
the aftermath of a Cylon - a cybernetic race bio-
logically identical to humans - invasion that nearly
wipes out mankind. With its superb acting and
storytelling, BSG offers more than science-fiction
spectacle: It's a show about the moral intricacies of
SYFT war and human conflict. Roslin/Airlocks 2012.

COVER
Daily Arts writers go

Daniel Johnson is back once
again with the handy DIY help
book "How to Catch a Falling
Knife." Adding to the success of
the popular "How to Catch ... "
series, which has churned out
such hits as "How to Catch a Fall-
ing Bucket of Soup" and "How to
Catch Somebody Else's Newborn
Infant," Johnson clearly demon-
strates that he is the master of
catching things. By reading this
companion of dropping cutlery
(and the methods of securing said
cutlery), perhaps one day, you too
could be a black belt in the art of
catching things.
"How to Catch a Falling Knife"
is helpfully splitinto separate sec-
tions,each detailingthe numerous
important aspects one must con-
sider. In the first chapter, Johnson

DANILL
J OH NSO N
ALICE JAMES
showcases his vast knowledge of
different knives, citing the specif-
ic differences between catching
a Santoku chef's blade from, say,
your average Forschner paring
knife (the difference could cost
you a finger!).
You might think, after perus-
ing the various knives you plan on
catching, that you might be ready
without another thought. But, as
Johnson clearly notes, you would
be dead wrong.
Perhaps the most useful of
the book's 43 distinct sections
details the "aerodynamics" of
falling knives, as pictured on the
cover. Look on in fascination at
the immensely helpful pictures,
which show (by use of colored
smoke) how none of the 20 tested
knives actually affect air currents

in any measurable way.
Johnson even describes (in 37
detailed accounts) of his firsthand
experiences with the different
techniques one can use: the basic
"flailing grab for the handle," the
"oh my God this knife is going to
impale my foot unless I catch it,"
and for those who want to show
off, the "one in a million chance
grabbing the blade doesn't make
me die of blood loss."
For those interested, the
"Deluxe" version of "How to
Catch a Falling Knife" includes
a set of training knives to leave
around the kitchen, until you one
day bump one off a table by acci-
dent. And when that day comes,
with Daniel Johnson's help, you'll
know what to do.

STEP I1( SCR
Screa
Like in the salons of 17th
and 18th century France,
this weekly installment
will feature two Daily Arts
writers discussing the finer
points of arts mediums
from at least 10 years ago.
When the elusive and erratic
Ghostface asks Sidney Prescott
(Neve Campbell) - the protago-
nist of the iconic "Scream" fran-
chise - if she likes scary movies,
she replies: "What's the point?"
"They're all the same. Some
stupid killer stalking some big-
breasted girl who can't act, who
is always running up the stairs
when she should be running out
the front door. It's insulting."
She has a point. Once upon a
time, feminist heroines in horror
films weren't all that uncommon
("Alien" 's Lt. Ellen Ripley, "The
Silence of the Lambs" 's Special
Agent Clarice Starling, etc). But
most horror films in the past two
decades - particularly of the
slasher nature - are notoriously
misogynistic and stereotype-
ridden. They glorify virginity and
mix sexually suggestive imagery
with spurting blood and severed
bones.
"Scream" is the anti-horror
film. Unpacking almost every
trope in the genre, Kevin Wil-
liamson's ingenious script holds
up a mirror to teen-slasher cin-
ema and fingers the formulaic
nature of it all: "The police are
always off-track with this shit! If
they'd watch 'Prom Night,' they'd
save time! There's a formula to it.
Avery simple formula!"
Williamson's love for the genre
emanates through the film's dia-
logue (with references to "Hal-
loween," "Psycho," "Silence of the
Lambs," "The Exorcist," "Car-
rie" and dozens more). And his
partner is quite the horror aficio-
nado himself: Wes Craven, who
sired serial killer legend Freddie
Kreuger. Between Williamson's

spirit: "What does the library
become when you get rid of books
and you just have terminals?" he
asked with hands turned up when
we spoke last month. Yet the battle
has also touched off his anger and
indignation.
Inside his bookshop, a warm
pool of bookshelves that some-
how feel homemade, Alloway
flashed that ferocity when I
asked him about the future of
books, a game of educated guess-
work that he clearly felt the
library and other booksellers
have given up too early.
"I am fully prepared to retire,
drop dead right there, selling
books," he said, pointing to his
" cluttered desk in defiance. "A lot
of people talk about digital books
and the threat that digital books
pose to them."
His voice dimmed and his

hands, which had darted here
and there throughout the con-
versation, dropped to his sides.
"And I think it's more of some-
body saying, 'Digital books are
a threat to you,' and them say-
ing, 'They are? Oh my,' instead of
actually thinking about it."
Alloway, it soon became evi-
dent, has thought about it. He
has done so at a level far deeper
than the booksellers who he said
have retreated from the menace
of Amazon. He does not sense
much threat from the Internet
retailer, digital books or even the

selling. In this capricious age
of bookselling and occasional
alarm-raising, he has been lucky
enough to stay the course and
advise other booksellers, as if
dispensing common sense, that
"if you keep doing what you do,
you'll be okay."
When I asked Alloway where
that self-assuredness comes
from - that is, why he has such
robust faith in a technology that,
to some, seems to be plunging
into the drain right behind the
print newspaper - he slipped
into his professorial robes again.

When I came to University
orientation three summers ago,
I received some news that made
me groan: "Scream 4" was being
beaten as a medium.
"We are not there yet," he
summed up, referring to a pos-
sible era of reading commanded
by digital technology. Without
even a murmur of self-doubt, he
added, "We are not even close to
being there yet."
But as much as he reveres the
printed book as an artifact and
criticizes the e-book as an alter-
native technology, Alloway's
confidence about staying the
course and keeling over behind
his desk does not seem to stem
from his thoughts about the best
technology. It derives instead
from his style of bookselling.
While other storeowners are
following Borders down the way
of shortsightedness or otherwise
trying to completely overhaul
their shops, Alloway is return-
ing to the classical principles of
bookselling that buoyed his pre-
decessors through even the Great
Depression.
He is stocking his shop with
more benches and chairs than any
other store in town to attract read-
ers, afactheboastedtometheway
a marathoner would announce his
best time. He is experimenting
with new selections and added
a literature section between the
time I first met him in April and
our interview last month.
And he is poring over old book-
seller memoirs, taking stock of
even the smallest tips. Where
other booksellers might find a
chapter about the shipping of
books stale, Alloway scraped it
clean, taking stock of even the
most miniscule tips.
Above all, though, in an era
when used and rare booksellers
may be losing customers to the
Internet, he is cultivating lasting
relationships with customers on
the premise of putting the right
book in their hands. After 12 years
in the bookshop, Alloway is devel-
oping the ability to look at a book
and instinctively know which cus-
tomer to give it to.
"That's the purpose of the book-
store in a lotof ways," Murphy told
me when we met at a restaurant in
the shadow of a behemoth Barnes
& Noble. "Yeah, it's about making
money to a degree. But that's not
the overriding concern. It's more
about passing on an intellectual
heritage."

of parody (and not the kind the
movie wants, either).
Director Wes Craven routinely
receives credit for reviving the
long-stagnant horror genre. And
yet, "Scream" is anything but
scary. Ghostface chases his vic-
Documenting the past
Among the intellectual heritages
that Alloway has been most eager
to pass on is the history of Ann
Arbor's booksellers; a past that, to
him, records one of the most fas-
cinating chapters of the history of
books in the country. It is a heritage
Alloway has been chasing for the
last few years, atleast informally, in
the hopes of writing a book that will
commemorate an era of this town's
history when bookselling was a
tourist attraction.
In the early 1970s, Alloway
explained to me when we first
met, bookshops like Centicore
Books, Bob Marshall's and Wahr's
- shops that had thrived in Ann
Arbor since the early twentieth
century - all shuttered their doors
within a few years of one another.
Whether their collapses were due
to the economy at the time, the old
age of their owners or another set
of factors, Alloway is not sure.
Yet the shops that replaced them
inaugurated a new, thrilling era of
bookselling in Ann Arbor. Com-
munity News Center, which had
one of its two shops on the corner
of South University Avenue and
South Forest Avenue, became the
go-to shop for magazines. Shaman
Drum Bookshop, which closed in
2009, was a destination for books
on history and poetry. Even Bor-
ders, famed for its great selection
before it grew into a behemoth,
had its own niche in scholarly and
computer science books.
Thoseyearsbetween 1979,when
Centicore Books became the last
of the old generation to close, and
1992, when Borders was sold to
Kmart, marked the golden age of
booksellinginAnnArbor's history.
Atthetime,morethan30booksell-
ers coexisted here and the town
was so reputed for its books that
outsiders from across the country
would devote entire visits to survey
Ann Arbor bookstores.
"That was really the age of inde-
pendence," Alloway said. "There
was just a lot of diversity in the new
book trade. It was a very vibrant
and fruitful period ... Everybody
had a different take."
Alloway told me that his book
will attempt to chronicle the sto-
ries of the bookshops of that era
for future generations of booksell-
ers, in the same fashion that older

tims through their homes, knife
in hand. After the initial moment
of suspense (leaping out at his
victims after a game of cat and
mouse played over the phone)
what ensues becomes comical as
Ghostface slips and slides over
his gown, a demented attempt at
shock horror that always fails to
hit its mark.
Moreover, while I'm not
bothered if people wish to say
"Scream" made slasher flicks
mainstream again, I'm bereaved
by anyone who hints that it's the
most memorable of the '90s hor-
ror canon. Before there was Sid-
ney there was Clarice Starling.
And before there was Ghostface
there was a psychopath named
Hannibal Lecter. While "Scream"
may be entertaining in a post-
modern, play-with-its-own-
premise sort of way, its pleasure
is fleeting, superficial, going no
deeper than the scream carved on
Ghostface's mouth.
Yet even lemons have their
perks. And in the case of this
dud the perk's name is Deputy
Dewey (David Arquette, "Cougar
Town"). Where the rest of the
cast's pretty faces ooze nothing
more than pretention, Arquette

memoirs guided him. He has been
interviewing the owners of shops
and their relatives and soon he will
launch a website where customers
of that time can share their memo-
ries.
Alloway said he wanted to pre-
serve an era of the history of the
book and of Ann Arbor that would
otherwise be lost. Part of his moti-
vation, he said, is that the owners
of bookstores such as Centicore
Books and Bob Marshall's, now
in their late '80s, will soon no lon-
ger be able to tell their stories. But
more than that, the project is based
on a hope that people here will
remember how spirited the book
culture once was and "value what's
left even more."
"It can remind a town like Ann
Arbor, which seems to be being
taken over by chain stores, that
each town is different," he said.
"Ann Arbor is not Royal Oak; Ann
Arbor is not Lansing; Ann Arbor
is not Kalamazoo or any of those
other places."
"The old days," today
During my visit with Alloway
last month, I asked him to recount
how he had become a bookseller.
He began by recalling his child-
hood in Kansas, the freedom of
living in a small town whose resi-
dents all knew one another. He
remembered how he could stay
at the library, or out and about in
town, until late and his parents
never wondered where he was or
worried about his safety.
"It was one of those things
where you could get on a bike at
eleven o'clock, go out to eat with
your friends, hang out all day in
town or in the woods, and then
come back for dinner," he said
wistfully. "And your mom didn't
worry about you," he went on.
"You were all right."
As we were talking, a regu-
lar customer who looked to be of
retirement age approached his
desk with a book she intended to
buy.

When she overheard Alloway
discussing his childhood, she
said, "Oh, yeah, those were the old
days."
Alloway rang her up, bid her
farewell, and then watched her
disappear into the crowd on the
streets.
