Federal court reaffirms Ross 
overstated property value

Court of Appeals 
upholds Tax Court 
ruling on charitable 
tax deduction

On Friday morning, the U.S. 
Court of Appeals upheld the 
judgement in a case involving 
alleged tax evasion by Stephen 
M. Ross, University of Michigan 
alum and benefactor for whom 
the Ross School of Business 
and Stephen M. Ross Academic 
Center are named. Ross and 
business partners are accused of 
overstating the value of property 
donated to the University in a 
charitable tax deduction by the 
Internal Revenue Service.
In the case, the billionaire and 
real estate developer, along with 
a group of business associates, 
donated property — a Southern 
California building which housed 

a data center — to the University 
to fulfill a gift. The University 
then resold the property for 
almost $2 million in cash to 
satisfy the gift requirement, and 
the $2 million eventually grew to 
$5 million. 
Though 
the 
property 
was 
appraised in 2017 for $3.4 million, 
Ross and his affiliates claimed a 
charitable tax deduction of $33 
million, meaning they claimed 
the property was worth nearly 
$30 million more than its real 
value. The IRS uncovered this 
claim and has since imposed a 
40% penalty for underpayment 
of tax — a penalty upheld by the 
Court of Appeals.
The University has contended 
its innocence in this situation. In 
2017, University spokesman Rick 
Fitzgerald said the University 
was not found at fault, and he said 
Friday afternoon the University 
has no change in comment.
“During the course of this 
case, which dates back more than 
a decade, neither the Internal 
Revenue Service nor the U.S. Tax 

Court found any fault with the 
university’s receipt or handling of 
this donation from Stephen Ross,” 
Fitzgerald 
wrote. 
“University 
officials were called as potential 
witnesses, but in June 2015 were 
released prior to testifying, as 
the 
parties 
determined 
that 
university officials had nothing to 
add to the case.”
Fitzgerald 
affirmed 
the 
transaction of the property was 
reviewed by tax experts and legal 
counsel.
Ronald Katz, Ross’ former 
tax 
accountant, 
and 
Harold 
Levine, a lawyer who helped 
with the donation, were charged 
with felony obstruction and tax 
evasion 
respectively, 
though 
both cases are unrelated to Ross’ 
current legal situation. 
Ross and his partners, listed 
under RERI Holdings, faced their 
latest loss in the case Friday when 
the Court of Appeals upheld the 
prior judgement of the Tax Court.

Academics talk
collaboration in 
higher education

Town Hall examines 
integration strategies 
for STEM, arts at ‘U’

On Tuesday morning, about 70 people 
gathered in the Michigan League for 
“Branches from the Same Tree: A U-M 
Town Hall on the Integration of Arts, 
Humanities, and STEMM.” The event 
focused on discussing how to best work 
towards a more integrative environment 
between 
the 
different 
academic 
communities on campus.
The 
campus-wide 
town 
hall 
was 
hosted by the University of Michigan 
President’s 
Office, 
Provost’s 
Office, 
ArtsEngine and Alliance for the Arts 
in Research Universities in partnership 
with the National Academies of Sciences, 
Engineering and Medicine.
Rebecca Cunningham, associate vice 
president for research and health sciences, 
opened the event by introducing the 
challenges integration can help tackle. 
Tom Rudin, director of the board on higher 
education and workforce at the National 
Academies 
for 
Sciences, 
Engineering 
and Medicine, held a demonstration 
where attendees had Monopoly money 
representing 
University 
funding. 
Participants put the mock money into a 
basket of their choice representing possible 
funding recipients. Most of the attendees 
put their mock money in baskets about 
increasing interdisciplinary collaboration, 
setting the tone for an event focused on 
innovative ways to integrate the arts and 
humanities with STEMM.
When the floor opened for questions, 
many people voiced opinions on different 
aspects of the exercise. Some expressed 
time and space are resources just as valuable 
as money.
Marvin 
Parnes, 
interim 
executive 
director of the alliance for the arts in 
research universities, brought up a point 
about integration that became a main 
theme over the duration of the event.

SMTD alum show 
support of LEO

Students, alum 
express solidarity 
with lecturers facing 
course load cuts

Approximently 50 University 
of Michigan School of Music, 
Theatre 
& 
Dance 
alumni 
have sent videos to the SMTD 
administration, 
voicing 
their 
support 
for 
the 
Lecturers’ 
Employee Organization and their 
non-tenure 
faculty 
members. 
This comes after LEO accused 
the SMTD of unjustifiably cutting 
course loads from two non-
tenure faculty members after 
the ratification of a new contract 
between LEO and the University. 
The new contract was ratified 
in July 2018. It included salary 
increases, 
improved 
health 
benefits and job security for 
nearly 1,700 non-tenure track 

faculty across the University’s 
three campuses.
Controversy 
emerged 
when 
SMTD administration notified 
Missy Beck, lecturer of dance, 
that a course she has taught for 
nine years would be taken over by 
a tenured faculty member. In the 
email, Anita Gonzalez, interim 
chair of the Department of Dance, 
told Beck her course load was 
being cut to avoid paying her the 
salary increase outlined in her 
new contract.
“Because of the large increase 
in LEO salaries the administration 
would like to move as many LEO 
courses as possible to tenure track 
faculty,” Gonzalez wrote.
SMTD has since then denied 
such claims and stated the course 
load changes were results of a 
review of its entire instructional 
workforce, including all tenured, 
tenure-track and clinical faculty, 
lecturers and graduate student 
instructors.

Chatime, CoCo 
open on Central, 
North Campuses

On Wednesday morning during 
finals week, LSA junior Theresa 
Pham traveled to North Campus 
around 9 a.m. Pham was going to 
the third day of CoCo Fresh Tea & 
Juice’s soft opening — almost two 
hours before the store opened its 
doors.
“I think why most people tried 
it or waited so long in line was 
to see if it was really worth the 
hype,” Pham said. “For the most 
part, I think most people can 
agree it was.”
CoCo 
and 
Chatime, 
two 
Taiwan-based chains specializing 
in a popular drink known as 
“bubble tea” or “boba,” opened in 
Ann Arbor in late April. Chatime, 
opened downtown on Maynard 
Street, and CoCo, located on 
North 
Campus 
on 
Plymouth 
Road, join Sweeting and Bubble 
Island 
on 
South 
University 
Avenue, bringing the number of 
bubble tea shops in Ann Arbor up 
to four.
Since opening, both CoCo and 
Chatime have attracted lines with 
over a two-hour waiting periods 
throughout 
their 
respective 
opening weeks. According to 
Business senior Connie You, 
these 
lines 
don’t 
represent 
everyone who is interested in the 
drinks.

“I feel like the lines would’ve 
been even longer if more people 
actually came in person,” You 
said. “I know a lot of my friends 
bought like 20 at a time for other 
people.”
This demand for bubble tea in 
Ann Arbor may reflect the drink’s 
growing popularity around the 
country. Invented in Taiwan in 
the 1980’s, the original bubble tea 
drink combines tea and milk with 
chewy tapioca pearls, from which 
“bubble” tea gets its name. As 
the drink has evolved, becoming 
available in an assortment of 
fruity flavors and with a variety 
of topping options — like grass 
jelly, red beans and egg pudding 
to name a few — boba has spread 
beyond Asia.
Brought to the United States by 
Taiwanese immigrants, bubble 
tea first got its footing on the West 
Coast, where it has become “an 
integral part of Asian-American 
culture in Los Angeles” and other 
coastal cities. In recent years, 
the bubble tea market has grown 
significantly: Chatime sells over 
100 million cups of boba a year, 
and CoCo has more than 3,500 
stores worldwide. From 2017 
to 2023, the global bubble tea 
market is forecasted to expand at 
a compound annual growth rate 
of 7.4 percent.
“Each location will surely find 
some pre-existing bubble tea 
fans, and plenty of people eager 
to try something new,” Uri Bram 
wrote in a Quartz article.

The city of Ann Arbor, 
in partnership with the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 
Students for Clean Energy 
group, are in the process of 
planning 
a 
volunteer-led 
installation of solar panels 
on Ann Arbor’s Fire Station 
Six. The installation, previ-
ously scheduled for May 27, 
has been tentatively pushed 
back to mid-June or July.
Engineering senior Grant 
Dukus, director of research 
and development for Stu-
dents for Clean Energy, said 
the project team is working 
through the “nitty-gritty 
details” and anticipates the 
installation will be very 
soon.
Dukus said Students for 
Clean Energy turned to Ann 
Arbor with the idea for the 
installation, having expe-
rienced trouble getting the 
University to commit to a 
similar project.
“We found that it is very 
tough for these projects to 
get done in a timely manner 
on campus just because of 
all of the hoops you have to 
jump through,” Dukus said.
Missy Stults, sustainabil-
ity and innovations manager 
for the city of Ann Arbor, 
said the city is working with 
its legal department to con-
firm safety precautions and 
financial considerations of 
the installation. Stults said 
these finalizations should 
take time.
“I’m not so focused on the 
actual installation date as I 
am on making it right, and 
we can replicate it, because 

that’s the most important 
thing,” Stults said. “So, if 
we do this really well, and 
people are comfortable with 
it, it means the next one will 
be faster.”
Stults said there was a 
large learning curve with 
the fire station solar instal-
lation because it is the first 
project of its kind undertak-
en by the new Department 
of Sustainability, which is 
only about 10 months old. 
Housed by the city admin-
istrator’s office — the execu-
tive office of the city — Stults 
said the Department of 
Sustainability’s 
existence 
proves Ann Arbor’s commit-
ment to environmentalism.
“What’s really significant 
about the creation of the 
office is that it really formal-
ized and drew attention to 
the importance of the prior-
ity the city has around sus-
tainability,” Stults said.
LSA senior Taylor Lind, 
research and development 
team chair for Students 
for Clean Energy, said she 
believes Ann Arbor does an 
exceptional job of encourag-
ing sustainable practices.
“They have a fairly thor-
ough climate action plan in 
process, and I believe that 
they are going through a lot 
of different planning to meet 
those goals. So, I think they 
are definitely in the right 
place and have a lot more 
progress made than other 
cities in the state, and I’d say 
even in the country,” Lind 
said.

Despite 
light 
drizzle 
throughout the day, hun-
dreds of local residents 
and visitors to Ann Arbor 
visited Kerrytown for the 
second annual Flower Day. 
Sponsored by the Sunday 
Artisan Market and the 
Ann Arbor Farmers Mar-
ket, the event featured a 
variety of flower selections 
and artisan wares for sale 
as well as food trucks, kids 
arts and crafts and face 
painting.
The 
Sunday 
Artisan 
Market is a weekly arts 
and crafts market open 
April through December. 
The artisans at the market 
make all the products they 
sell, according to the Man-
ager of the Sunday Artisan 
Market, Deb Dursi.
Flower Day is the only 
day of the year where the 
Artisan Market combines 
with the Farmers Market. 
This collaboration attracts 
customers who may not 
usually frequent the Arti-
sans 
Market, 
explained 
Shanita Richards, owner 
of Motor City Spreads, a 
gourmet jam and jelly busi-
ness.
“These 
vendors 
sell 
beautiful things, but you 
wouldn’t know it unless 
they had a market to go to,” 
Richards said. “It’s nice 
because you get all the peo-

ple that normally buy flow-
ers, they get to come and 
see what the Sunday Mar-
ket has to offer. It’s one of 
those treasures that people 
don’t often realize is here.”
Ann 
Arbor 
resident 
Samantha Daly said she 
likes coming to the Arti-
sans Market with her fam-
ily.
“We enjoy coming down 
and walking around,” Daly 
said. “There’s a variety 
of different vendors and 
there’s always things for 
the kids too.”
Rackham student Linda 
Gong said her brother and 
his girlfriend were visiting 
Ann Arbor, so she brought 
them to the Artisans Mar-
ket as part of showing 
them around the city.
“I like how it is a great 
collection of local vendors 
with a variety of goods,” 
Gong said. “The flowers 
are really pretty. Even 
though it’s raining, it’s 
been really nice.”
Lynn Mullin, a visitor to 
Ann Arbor from Pennsyl-
vania, said she noticed the 
Artisans Market is a com-
munity.
“Even as I was walk-
ing through, I saw people 
who were greeting each 
other, vendors who knew 
their clients,” Mullin said. 
“I feel like it shows how 
artistic the community is; 
how ecologically-minded 
the community is.”

Dursi 
explained 
the 
Artisan 
Market 
was 
founded in 1991 by arti-
sans who had trouble get-
ting spaces at the Farmers 
Market. Since 2006, the 
Artisans Market has been 
separate from the city of 
Ann Arbor. Self-governed 
and self-run, the member 
artisans elect their own 
board and hire their own 
manager.
“It’s a good group of 
people, very much a team,” 
Dursi said. “They look out 
for each other. It’s very 
unique in that it’s like a 
family.”
Several vendors echoed 
Dursi’s 
sentiments, 
including Diane Sheffrey, 
owner of Baubles, a glass 
and fiber art business.
“The Artisans Market is 
a nice, comfortable venue,” 
Sheffrey said. “It’s one 
of my favorite places to 
sell because the vendors 
become like family.”
Richards 
explained 
she is new to the area and 
decided to become a ven-
dor at the Artisans Mar-
ket to have a “family” in 
the same spot every week. 
According to Daren Otis 
— president of the Arti-
sans Market and owner of 
Lightweight Travel Totes, 
a totes and purses business 
— the Market’s affordable 
artisan fee attracts both 
longtime and amateur ven-
dors.

“For a new person … 
we’re a place where they 
can get started and learn 
the ropes and learn from 
other vendors,” Otis said. 
“We help each other.”
Otis has been selling 
at the Artisans Market 
almost 
since 
it 
began. 
Compared to art shows, 
Otis explained the Arti-
sans Market helps her 
build 
stronger 
relation-
ships with her customers.
“I like the fact that I can 
develop a customer base 
because I’m here every 
week,” Otis said. “People 
who like my product come 
back, and they bring their 
friends. … It’s really grati-
fying.”
Dursi 
expressed 
she 
was pleased with Flower 
Day’s turnout, both from 
vendors and the local 
community.
“The crowd is really 
strong today, and that, to 
me, is really indicative 
of a positive community 
response,” 
Dursi 
said. 
“We have more vendors 
this year than last year for 
Flower Day, which tells 
me they did well enough 
last year to come back and 
give it another go.”
Sheffrey 
said 
the 
Artisans 
Market 
is 
a 
significant 
downtown 
attraction.
“It brings a lot of peo-
ple downtown,” she said. 
“There’s a vibrancy to it.”

M

y first exposure to abortion 
was the ’80s movie “Dirty 
Dancing” — not a health 
class or a Sunday in church, but a 
movie. If you’ve seen it you know the 
scene. If not, one of the characters finds 
out she’s pregnant. A few scenes and 
exchanges of cash later, she is found sick 
in her bed from some sort of infection 
from a “back-alley doctor.” The word 
“abortion” is never stated; it is simply 
implied. I didn’t even fully grasp what 
had happened to the girl until I watched 
it years later as a teen who could finally 
put the pieces of the puzzle together.
“Dirty Dancing” is set in 1963 — 10 
years before the landmark Supreme 
Court decision Roe v. Wade legalized 
abortion — when back-alley abortions 
like this were the norm in states 
where the procedure was illegal. Fast 
forward to 2019, nearly 50 years after 
Roe v. Wade: Conservative states have 
launched an orchestrated attack on 
abortion, making it a felony, banning 
it after a fetal heartbeat is detected 
(usually around six weeks, before most 
women even know they’re pregnant) 
and even leaving out exceptions for rape 
or incest. 
With a conservative lean on the 
Supreme Court, these restrictive laws 
are looking to put Roe v. Wade back on 
the table and ultimately overturn it. I’m 
not writing to explain why overturning 
the legalization of abortion would be 
disastrous for anyone with a uterus — 
bodily autonomy and freedom from 
government-mandated 
pregnancies 
should not even be a question. Yet 
here we are, on the brink of a return 
to coat hanger abortions and telling 
51 percent of the U.S. population that 
their choice doesn’t matter. But I 

want to talk about pop culture. 
Pop culture is often an individual’s 
first exposure to varying ideas. 
Whether it’s a song, show, movie or 
play, pop culture allows someone to 
look outside the bubble they live in and 
into a world they have not yet seen. 
Prior to and following “Dirty Dancing,” 
abortion has been a plot line or topic 
addressed in a multitude of movies and 
TV shows alike. Despite this exposure, 
abortion is still a taboo word, inciting 
heated debate wherever it is brought 
up. Yet, dancing around the concept of 
abortion — why people choose it, how it 
makes them feel, who gets them — does 
no good for the discussion of it. Abortion 
is treated like a dirty word, not a medical 
procedure that about one quarter of 
women will undergo. To improve the 
conversation about abortion, we must 
normalize it to show, through widely 
consumed media, that abortion is not 
just its myths and falsifications.
Perhaps the first radical portrayal 
of abortion was broadcasted in 1972 
on the CBS show “Maude” starring 
Bea Arthur (“Golden Girls”). After 
discovering she’s pregnant, Maude 
talks with her husband and they decide 
they do not want to raise a child at 
their age. In New York where Maude 
lives, abortion is legal, so she gets the 
procedure; thus inciting over 7,000 
letters of protest to CBS. For its time 
period, the way abortion was depicted 
in “Maude” was revolutionary. It 
features an honest discussion with a 
partner and reasoning for the choice, 
all done a year before abortion was 
nationally legal. More modern media 
like “Juno” and “Knocked Up,” show 
abortion as the option only “bad people” 
choose.

Obviously, I cannot force all media 
creators to cast abortion in a pro-choice 
light, but for those who have or want 
to — like the makers of “Scandal,” 
“Girls,” “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” “Jane 
the Virgin” and others — they should 
at least do it right. And that’s not to say 
those shows haven’t. They’ve shown 
abortion casually, as a difficult choice, 
surgically, medically, as a single woman, 
as a married woman and more. This is 
what abortion is, in reality, and that 
can be expanded. Some of the most 
popular shows in America are medical 
and family shows; shows that have the 
potential to actually make an impact 
and start a conversation. 
And they can do even more. They 
can show more low-income women 
getting abortions, as this is the main 
demographic; or show a devoutly 
religious person getting an abortion — 
as many do — and highlight that religion 
should not inhibit choice; or don’t make 
abortion into such a tragedy, because 
taking control of your body is not tragic 
and most women feel relief after an 
abortion; or show how men benefit 
from abortion, because that seems to be 
necessary when trying to get people 
to care about something; or even 
better, maybe the people of the United 
States can create comprehensive sex 
education for students to prevent 
these unwanted pregnancies and 
talk about abortion loudly instead of 
in hushed whispers. It shouldn’t be 
up to “Dirty Dancing” to teach kids 
about abortion, and it shouldn’t be 
up to the government to decide if you 
can get one.

S

ustainability goes further than 
typical policies and eco-struc-
tures learned about in environ-
ment classes; it is applicable to many 
facets of life. Recently, people have been 
examining a newer model for living 
sustainably: shopping consciously and 
understanding the impact that fast fash-
ion has on the world.
Fast fashion is commonly defined 
as clothing that is cheaply and quickly 
made in order to meet the demands of 
buyers as well as the rotating cycle of 
trends. Due to the unstoppable mar-
ket for popular clothing and styles, 
businesses like Forever 21 and H&M 
produce vast quantities of new clothes 
every month. The fast fashion industry 
needs to work on conscious alternatives 
to their production, or else consumers 
will need to avoid these models alto-
gether in order to help the planet. 
So how does this affect our ecosys-
tem? Typical consumers tend to buy 
an item that they like one moment and 
then discard it due to rapidly chang-
ing style trends. There are several 
methods to get rid of clothing; some 
eco-conscious ways are to donate to 
a thrift store, swap with friends or 
give to local shelters or charities. The 
most detrimental way to get rid of old 
clothes would be to directly throw 
them away, as they would then be sent 
straight to a landfill.
In the U.S. alone, there are about 11 
million tons of clothing thrown away 
every year. From this, the clothes that 
are cheaply made are contributing to 
heavy chemical seepage from dyes 
and fabrics into water systems and soil 
around the world. Furthermore, most 
fabrics take a long time to break down 
in a landfill and will release chemicals 
into the air.
Paying attention to the kinds of 
clothes you own is important. Take a 
look at the labels — are they composed 
of synthetic fabrics? If bought from a 
fast fashion retailer, the chances are the 
clothing items are made of some sort of 
blend of acrylic and synthetic materials. 
Through every laundry wash, micro-
fibers fall off clothing and are washed 
into the water system. Their small size 
allows them to get through water treat-
ment centers and into bodies of water. 
This is just another way cheap clothing 
is affecting natural environments.
The flow of microfibers into bodies of 
water can even directly affect humans. 
Reports are revealing that plastic 
microfibers are reaching fish that are 
processed for grocery stores and con-
sumption, meaning people are eating 
plastics stemming from our laundry. 
To fix this issue, individuals can either 
choose to buy fewer synthetic materials 
or purchase a special filter for washing 

machines that filters out microfibers. 
Hopefully we can begin to improve 
water quality and the quality of what 
humans consume in the long run.
There are fortunately several alterna-
tives to all of these fast fashion failings. 
The direct alternative would be to pur-
chase items from sustainable clothing 
brands. Some well-known and trusted 
sustainable brands to look out for are 
Everlane, Pact and Veja which special-
izes in low-impact, sustainably-made 
sneakers. These eco-friendly brands are 
on the rise and cater to a wide variety of 
customers and styles. Look out for com-
panies that market the fact they have 
transparent business models, sustain-
able materials and fair employment.
These types of business are help-
ing to recreate the fashion world into 
a place where working conditions are 
healthy and products are made con-
sciously with a small carbon footprint. 
Some brands use quality materials in 
their products, while others build their 
brand on reusing and revamping recy-
cled fabric. Companies may even solely 
rely on deadstock fabric, which is fabric 
that has been left-over from large textile 
mills or factories. This deadstock fabric 
is then reused in new garments instead 
of simply being thrown away. All of 
these creative approaches to sustainable 
fashion are thoughtful and eco-friendly 
sources for clothing. If individuals begin 
to primarily support corporations that 
use sustainable processes, then, hope-
fully, the rest of the market will shift 
toward prioritizing these values. 
Of course, the price for quality gar-
ments and business is typically much 
steeper than shopping at a fast fashion 
retailer. This economic standpoint is 
what makes fast fashion so appeal-
ing, especially for younger consumers 
who do not want to spend all of their 
money on clothing. If the higher prices 
of sustainable fashion deter you, there 
are ways to shop consciously on a bud-
get. The best option for this is thrift-
ing. Thrift stores are present in almost 
every town across the country. They 
bring in local donations and resell 
them for low prices, and most thrift 
stores carry clothing for everyone. 
Thrifting is a clear way to shop con-
sciously because the money does not 
go directly to fast fashion retailers. It 
is funneled into a charitable organiza-
tion that capitalizes on the values of 
recycling and reusing. Stop in at your 
local thrift shop and see what gems 
you can find.

A

uthoritarianism is a term 
that, 
historically, 
has 
evoked images of violent 
oppression and chaotic military 
coups, and with good reason. From 
Stalin’s Soviet gulags to Augusto 
Pinochet’s militaristic takeover 
of 
the 
Chilean 
government, 
authoritarians have traditionally 
used violence, power and strength 
to forcefully secure power and, 
subsequently, to silence dissenters 
and maintain a firm grip on this 
power. While these types of brutal 
regimes still exist today in places 
such as North Korea, they are less 
common than they once were.
In place of the traditional 
authoritarian regime, the 21st 
century has seen the rise of a less 
extreme, but more sophisticated, 
style of subtle authoritarianism. 
Often dubbed “illiberal democra-
cies,” these regimes take hold in 
democratic countries and rely on 
coercion, corruption and the rage 
of the electorate to gnaw away at 
the liberties and freedoms that are 
essential for a functioning democ-
racy. Using this softer approach, 
leaders in theoretically democratic 
countries such as Turkey and Hun-
gary have been able to push their 
respective nations towards authori-
tarianism, without the violence tra-
ditionally associated with it.
In their quest towards authori-
tarianism, most illiberal democra-
cies follow a relatively similar path. 
First, most rely on a central figure 
— usually a charismatic speaker — 
who declares that there is a fun-
damental problem in the country 
which they alone can fix, while 
whipping up rage among voters. In 
1999, an upstart politician in Tur-
key, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, was 
jailed for four months after pub-
licly reading a nationalist, Islam-
themed poem. Two years later, 
Erdogan founded his Islamist AK 
Parti on the values of Turkish 
nationalism and devotion to Islam, 
and by 2003 the AK had a majority 
in Parliament. In Hungary, Vik-
tor Orban’s rise was quite similar. 
His Fidesz Party came into power 
in 2010, with a similar focus on 
nationalism and the “Hungarian” 
people. “I love Hungary, I love 
Hungarians, and I prefer Hungari-
an interests to global financial cap-
ital, or Jewish capital, if you like,” 
said one Fidesz parliament mem-
ber in 2009, explaining the views 
that propelled Orban into office. 
However, being elected is just 
the beginning. What separates 
wannabe-authoritarians 
from 

principled democratic leaders is 
their devotion to systematically 
dismantling institutions which 
protect democracy and limit their 
power. Within the government 
offices, this usually entails replac-
ing qualified bureaucrats, who will 
stand up for democratic principles, 
with loyalists who will rubber-
stamp whatever the leader asks 
for. Beyond that, it also includes 
making legal changes to expand 
the leader’s power. In 2017, a high-
ly controversial public referendum 
orchestrated by Erdogan allowed 
unstamped ballots to be counted as 
valid, expanding his powers mas-
sively. The referendum gave Erdo-
gan the ability to directly appoint 
top officials, intervene in the coun-
try’s legal system and declare a 
state of emergency.
In Hungary, Orban set out to 
enact a similar set of power-con-

centrating reforms. After Fidesz’s 
2010 parliamentary victory, Orban 
immediately gerrymandered dis-
tricts to increase his vote share 
going forward. Since then, he has 
expanded Hungary’s highest court 
in order to pack it with loyalist judges, 
fired civil servants in order to replace 
them with Fidesz loyalists and 
installed partisan supporters into cru-
cial roles such as election overseers.
In tandem with this, another cru-
cial feature of illiberal democracy is 
a shift towards authoritarian public 
oversight. This includes using various 
tactics to censor the press, demonize 
dissenters and ensure it is essentially 
impossible to lose power through 
democratic channels. For Erdogan, 
who has held power as Prime Min-
ister since 2003, creating laws to 
silence dissenting voices in the press 
has been an essential component 
of maintaining power. As part 
of his campaign for total control 
over the press, Erdogan has jailed 
319 journalists and shut down 189 
media outlets. If stifling the media 
isn’t enough to ensure complete 
control, sometimes illiberal demo-
crats decide to simply not accept 

democratic outcomes — something 
Erdogan has done. After a stutter-
ing Turkish economy propelled an 
opposition candidate into the Istan-
bul mayoral office earlier this year 
(this was particularly painful for 
Erdogan, who traditionally has had 
a strong base of support in Istan-
bul), Erdogan eventually ordered 
a recount. He cited vote-counting 
irregularities, yet the case for this 
being legitimate is beyond flimsy. 
Orban has followed suit with 
attacks on independent media 
outlets and democratic channels 
in Hungary. By 2017, it was esti-
mated that 90 percent of Hungar-
ian media outlets were controlled 
either by the government itself 
or by Fidesz supporters. Orban 
accomplished this by using his 
governmental powers to pres-
sure independent news organiza-
tions into selling their companies, 
primarily through financial and 
bureaucratic coercion — withhold-
ing advertising dollars, threatening 
to approve mergers that would hurt 
them, etc. Electorally, Fidesz has 
gone as far as creating fake opposi-
tion parties in order to splinter sup-
port among their opponents and 
retain power.
While these countries may not 
utilize the same overt, militaris-
tic tactics that many 20th century 
authoritarian governments used, 
that does not make their end goals 
any less dangerous. In tandem with 
their repressive policies, illiberal 
democracies are also careful to cul-
tivate the appearance of — at least 
moderate — fairness. For instance, 
Erdogan’s 
aforementioned 
2017 
presidential powers referendum 
didn’t pass with 90 percent of the 
vote, as often happens in authoritar-
ian regimes, but instead a mere 53 
percent. This is exactly what makes 
illiberal democracies so hard to 
push back against: Theoretically, 
it is possible an opposition party 
could win elections in either Tur-
key or Hungary, even if it clearly 
won’t happen. Furthermore, this 
movement has been empowered 
by a global expansion of illiberal 
democracy with varying levels 
of success by state. However, as 
long as prominent global leaders 
like President Donald Trump say 
“People have a lot of respect for 
this prime minister (Orban),” it’s 
exceedingly unlikely that the pow-
ers of illiberal democracy will be 
effectively reigned in.

Tyler, the Creator’s sixth full-
length album, IGOR, is both a natu-
ral step into his constantly evolving 
identity and marks a creative equi-
librium for the avant garde hip-hop 
artist.
In terms of Tyler’s eclectic dis-
cography, IGOR is probably most 
similar to Flower Boy, but to call it 
a continuation of Flower Boy’s jazzy 
weightlessness would be mislead-
ing. Where Flower Boy is zany and 
bright, IGOR holds back, rueful at 
its happiest.
The album, at its darkly tranquil 
core, traverses the gradual process 
of accepting existential uncer-
tainty. Many of Tyler’s albums act 
like operating tables for specific 
anxieties, unafraid to bloody the 
scalpel in the procedure. WOLF is 
the consummate example of this 
tendency, exploring the self-con-
suming angst of fatherly absence. 
With IGOR, coming to peace with 
himself doesn’t mean these anxiet-
ies will cease for Tyler, but rather 
that his ability to overcome them is 
improving.
The 
first 
track, 
“IGOR’S 
THEME,” is nothing more than 
a tone-setter for the rest of the 
album, following a simple, compel-
ling synth riff played over ener-
getic drums. But for the remainder 
of IGOR, the anxiety that Tyler 
places under his unique micro-
scope involves falling in and out 
of love. “EARFQUAKE,” the song 
that kicks off this journey, is one of 

Tyler’s catchiest ever, recalling the 
pleasantly swaying chords of “Bore-
dom” with a more poignant edge 
(and without the infectious sum-
meriness of Rex Orange County). It 
easily stands as one of the album’s 
highlights, even if it’s not the most 
ambitious of Tyler’s works to date.
The sense of haunting inevi-
tability Tyler lays out in “EARF-
QUAKE” with the line “’Cause 

when it all comes crashing down 
I’ll need you” persists throughout 
the album. In the song “RUNNING 
OUT OF TIME,” Tyler develops 
a tension between substance and 
style. Despite describing the quick-
ly crumbling facade of a relation-
ship, the beat is mystical, spacey 
and relatively slower than the rest 
of the album. The effect of this con-
tradiction conveys a hopeless long-
ing, a futile wish to slow time and 
alter the imminent.
One of the most fascinating 
aspects of IGOR is how different 
the album sounds based on one’s 
surroundings. The first few times 

I listened to it, I devoted all of my 
focus to the listen, usually sitting 
down. However, the experience 
of driving while playing IGOR 
revealed an entirely new facet of 
the album. Engaging myself in a 
soothingly systematic activity like 
driving shed light on just how even-
ly paced and naturally composed 
the album is. It tells a simple story, 
but one that fluctuates seamlessly 
through dynamic musical styles.
Much of this effect lies in Tyler’s 
typical genre-hopping. The pulsat-
ing, arpeggiated outro of “GONE, 
GONE / THANK YOU” grace-
fully melts into the sludgy, crack-
ing tones of “I DON’T LOVE YOU 
ANYMORE.” 
This 
penultimate 
track gives way to the explicitly 
bluesy finale of the album, “ARE 
WE STILL FRIENDS?” It’s one of 
Tyler, the Creator’s best songs, not 
because of its clarity in message 
but rather the lack thereof. Are our 
once-lovers still friends? That’s a 
likely yes. But are the ghosts of their 
romance really gone? That’s a far 
more compelling question, so Tyler 
knowingly keeps it ambiguous, with 
deceivingly harmonious chords and 
an all-too-bright melody.
IGOR is a robust, fascinating 
addition to the eccentric, self-
mythologizing canon of Tyler, the 
Creator. While it certainly bounds 
forward in his maturity as an artist, 
it lacks the edge that he so unapolo-
getically embodied. This transition 
shouldn’t be a disappointment; it 
doesn’t take away from the pierc-
ing power of his discography. Bet-
ter yet, Tyler has seemingly arrived 
at this pensive, nuanced stage of his 
persona on his own terms.

A Boy Is A Gun 
(Columbia Records)

“Booksmart” is a glorious cel-
ebration of the joys that come with 
being a teenage dirt bag. It’s also 
Olivia Wilde’s (“Life Itself”) direc-
torial debut. It’s also so, so good. 
Amy (Kaitlyn Dever, “Them That 
Follow”) and Molly (Beanie Feld-
stein, “Lady Bird”) are high school 
seniors who devoted all their ener-
gy to getting into stellar colleges. 
They had no fun and at the bitter 
end of the school year, they real-
ize that all the kids who did have 
fun got into the same schools. They 
make it their mission to finally go to 
a party that night, and what ensues 
is the most sincere 
odyssey of adoles-
cent stupidity.
Amy and Mol-
ly’s friendship is 
the 
bedrock 
of 
the 
whole 
film, 
which 
is 
why 
“Booksmart” 
manages to mean 
something, instead 
of falling into the 
high-school-romp 
wasteland. 
The 
two are involun-
tarily high in the suburban grass 
when Molly starts undermining 
how intensely she’s pining and Amy 
not-so-gently tells her to shut up. 
Without hesitation, Amy says that 
if a certain boy is who Molly wants 
then that certain boy is who she 
deserves. Duh. Their love for each 
other is effortless, and that’s what 
makes it so honest. This movie 
shows women at their very best, 
doing dumb shit for each other 
because they know it’s needed and 
because they want to.
All of these characters are clever 
in the stupid way that only high 
school seniors can be, and they’re 
all really sweet, even when they’re 
being assholes. There’s lust and love 
and even some loathing, but there is 
never malice. They’ve got none of 
Ferris Bueller’s irresponsibility, but 
they’re all just as big of shitheads.
Speaking of shitheads, all hail 
Gigi (Billie Lourd, “Billionaire Boys 
Club”). She rolls in to Leikeli47’s 
“Money,” and, from start to fin-

ish, nothing she does makes any 
sense. Lourd is hot in the super-
natural way that makes her seem 
like she can do absolutely anything, 
and Gigi operates under that same 
power. She’s a crazy queen con-
coction of a character, somehow 
elevating all those traits to create a 
caricature that’s entirely her own.
Fast but never rushed and 
unexpected but never overdone, 
“Booksmart” 
assertively 
cusps 
every coming-of-age trope it abides 
by. The class burnout isn’t going 
to college; he’s working at Google. 
The wannabe fuckboy drives a car 
painted in flames, and he wants to 
build airplanes and produce musi-
cals. The resident hunk can clock 
your Hogwarts house over a ner-
vous round of beer pong. Swoon.
The film itself 
is beautiful. The 
skateboards 
are 
sexy and the con-
fetti falls slowly. 
When my heart 
broke, Amy was 
underwater, 
and 
when 
it 
burst, 
Molly was hallu-
cinating a musical 
number. 
There’s 
enough whimsy to 
wade through the 
kind of unbound-
ed optimism that’s specifically 
reserved for high schoolers mak-
ing fools of themselves. But it’s all 
serious, you know? High schoolers 
are dreamy, but they’re also very 
intense. They feel everything — 
every unrequited love and missed 
opportunity alike. With a gorgeous 
ease, Wilde found a way to weave in 
the heartache with the hope.
It feels disrespectful to say I’m 
proud of Olivia Wilde because she 
is Olivia Wilde and I am dust, but I 
feel so much pride for this film that 
I had absolutely nothing to do with. 
This is a female-driven comedy 
that is always progressive but never 
tries too hard to be. It is so normal 
because of how confidently it just 
keeps going. This movie knows 
what it’s worth, and it never settles 
for jokes that aren’t good enough 
or characters that are mean for the 
sake of being sharp.

After ten days of festivities, 
the eighth annual Cinetopia Film 
Festival concluded May 19 at the 
Michigan Theater with a screen-
ing of “Autonomy,” a documen-
tary about self-driving cars. The 
film, which was directed by Alex 
Horwitz (“Hamilton’s Ameri-
ca”) and had originally aired at 
SXSW, explores the future of 
autonomous vehicles by trac-
ing the history of cars and driv-
ing. While the film shies away 
from rigorous analysis of some 
of the more fundamental issues 
surrounding self-driving cars, 
“Autonomy” is an entertaining 
(if blatantly biased) introduction 
to autonomous vehicles.
“Autonomy” opens with Mal-
colm Gladwell describing his 
vintage BMW in adoring detail. 
It’s “the most beautiful thing I 
own,” he says, and the car cer-
tainly is lovely — baby blue, ele-
gant but not impractical. Even 
for those whose cars are not 
pieces of impeccable German 
engineering, many people have 
some sort of emotional entangle-
ment with their vehicle. “Auton-
omy” carefully outlines this 
relationship, inviting historians 
and experts to tell the story of 
how cars drifted from commodi-
ties of convenience to symbols 

of freedom, adventure and self-
sufficiency. The movie deems 
cars embodiments of the desire 
to be masters of our own destiny, 
a proposal that’s spot-on. Beyond 
its practical uses, the car has 
become a co-conspirator, a dare 
to strike out on the road.
“You got a fast car / I want a 
ticket to anywhere / Maybe we 
make a deal / Maybe together we 
can get somewhere,” sings Tracy 

Chapman on “Fast Car,” and the 
whole song is full of longing, the 
car promising both escape and 
security. On “Highway Patrol-
man,” Bruce Springsteen breaks 
your heart describing a police 
officer who lets his brother 
escape to Canada. How? There’s 
a car chase, and a memory of 
brotherly love: “Well I chased 
him through them county roads / 
Till a sign said ‘Canadian border 
five miles from here’ / I pulled 
over the side of the highway and 
watched his tail lights disap-
pear.” In other words, it’s never 
just a car.

What would it mean to change 
all this? That’s the question 
“Autonomy” strives to answer, 
surveying the legal, safety and 
social 
concerns 
that 
might 
arise if we hand the keys to our 
machines over to the machines. 
The film is at its best when it 
allows philosophers and indus-
try professionals to weigh in on 
the morality of transferring the 
responsibilities of a driver to a 
machine. There’s a lot of inter-
esting territory to cover, and 
“Autonomy” is engrossing. But 
I’m more interested in all the 
things “Autonomy” leaves out.
“Autonomy,” which was pro-
duced by Car and Driver Maga-
zine, feels in some ways like an 
extended piece of propaganda 
from a director who isn’t fully 
ready to trot out the party line. 
The party line isn’t that self-
driving cars will be a safe and 
inevitable aspect of our collec-
tive future — it’s that cars will 
be, in one form or another. They 
might look and operate differ-
ently, but autonomous vehicles 
are still designed as commodities 
to be bought and owned by indi-
viduals. “Autonomy” is focused 
on delineating the glamour and 
danger of cars, and it makes a 
captivating case for the role cars 
have, will and should play in our 
daily lives. However, it never 
stops to ask why we’re commit-
ting our innovative energy to 

rethinking 
personal 
vehicles. 
Malcolm Gladwell, who is vocal 
about his reservations, mentions 
the application of self-driving 
features to public transporta-
tion, but this remains a largely 
untouched topic.
“Autonomy” explains that for 
self-driving cars to operate at 
optimum safety and efficiency, 
autonomous vehicles would need 
to be nearly ubiquitous. Imagine 
this: There would be no need for 
stop signs, since your car would 
be able to sense 
a 
pedestrian 
or 
another 
vehicle 
and adjust accord-
ingly. Cars could 
drive inches apart, 
and 
the 
frantic 
dance of merging 
onto 
a 
freeway 
or into a differ-
ent lane would be 
soothed into a sci-
ence. You could 
watch a movie on 
your commute, or 
send your kids to 
school in the fam-
ily 
car 
without 
having 
to 
drop 
them off.
“Autonomy” 
illustrates 
just 
how appealing this 
would be, but what 
the movie makes less explicit is 
that this future would require 
a cultural and material revolu-
tion — one that would be radical 
in scale but conservative in ide-
ology. In 2017, there were 276.1 
million cars in the United States 
alone, and all of them would need 
to be phased out or converted to 
realize this transformation. Of 
course, the automotive industry 
is investing in self-driving tech-
nology — this could be their big-
gest opportunity for sales since 
cars were invented! Maybe I’m 
being cynical, but regardless, I 
struggle to imagine the efficacy 
of such a fundamental remaking 
of transportation when the goal 
is limited to accident- and stress-
free driving. These are worthy 
aims, but it would be a grave 
mistake to pursue them without 
simultaneously considering the 
impact of cars on the environ-
ment.
“Autonomy” shows self-driv-
ing cars could mean a large reduc-
tion in crashes and pedestrian 
casualties. This is a wonderful 
possibility, but it’s an objective 
that shouldn’t be pursued uncrit-
ically. Car crashes are much 
more immediate and visible than 

fatalities from climate change, 
but both are equally deserving 
of consideration by automobile 
engineers. Autonomous vehicles 
might initially reduce green-
house gas emissions, especially if 
the cars are electric. But unless 
they operate on a schema outside 
traditional, individual car own-
ership, the effects are unlikely 
to be drastic enough (or fast 
enough) to offset climate change.
In Southeast Michigan, it’s 
nearly heretical to suggest that 
cars 
shouldn’t 
be a linchpin of 
American life. I 
understand 
this: 
My 
grandfather 
worked in a Ford 
factory, 
and 
my 
mom still has two 
Ford-emblazoned 
forks that he took 
home from the caf-
eteria at work. The 
Ford 
Company’s 
pension plan kept 
my 
grandmother 
comfortable until 
she died. I own a 
car, and I like hav-
ing one. “Autono-
my” is right: The 
automobile indus-
try is monumen-
tally important to 
individuals and to 
the American imagination and 
economy, especially in Michi-
gan. However, climate change 
will also impact the economy, in 
ways that automated cars do not 
fully account for.
Though 
the 
film 
offers 
exhaustive coverage of other 
aspects 
of 
self-driving 
cars, 
“Autonomy” doesn’t delve into 
the details of possible environ-
mental benefits or damages. The 
Intelligent Transportation Soci-
ety of America projects a two- 
to four-percent decrease in oil 
consumption from autonomous 
vehicles, and there are a number 
of projects showing autonomous 
technologies can help reduce 
emissions. This is good, but it’s 
not 
good 
enough, 
especially 
given the emissions that would 
be produced during manufactur-
ing. Though “Autonomy” tries 
to sidestep the issue by ignoring 
it altogether, the choice to stay 
silent about climate change sim-
ply confirms the extent to which 
carbon neutrality is not a prima-
ry goal of autonomous vehicles. 
Given the revolutionary nature 
of self-driving cars, we should 
be demanding something more 
emancipatory.

‘Autonomy’ neglects the 
stakes of self-driving cars

FILM REVIEW

In Southeast 
Michigan, it’s 
nearly heretical 
to suggest that 
cars shouldn’t 
be a linchpin of 
American life.

Clairo, Clairo, Clairo. 
You know what that sounds 
like? 
Elio, Elio, Elio (from the 
final scene of “Call Me By Your 
Name”). 
Yes, this might be dramatic, 
but allow me to force this com-
parison for just one moment, 
because listening to Clairo’s new 
single “Bags” (in anticipation of 
her debut album Immunity, due 
Aug. 2) launched me immediately 
into the heart-wrenching head-
space of the following quote from 
Andre Aciman’s “Call Me By Your 
Name” (CMBYN): 
“If he knew. If he only knew 
that I was giving him every 
chance to put two and two 
together and come up with a big-
ger number than infinity.”
Clairo’s new single “Bags” 
embodies this push and pull of 
summertime feelings, caught in 
a space between opposite mag-
netic forces where holding back 
affection sucks, but speaking out 
about it sucks equally as much, if 
not more. 
Clairo’s dainty voice, the sum-
mertime release, and her staple 
ability to be hazy (but not in the 
way that makes you think of over-
cast skies), launched me right 
into the green and yellow hues 
of “CMBYN.” With her fragile 
vocals, the scratchiness from 
switching between guitar strings 
and an overall sense of lingering, 
she cultivates the subsistence of 
entanglement. She creates this 
first-person point of view that 
feels so similar to Elio with lyrics: 
“I can’t read you, but if you want, 
the pleasure’s all mine. Can you 
see me using everything to hold 
back?” 
Also strikingly similar to Elio 
is the tangibility of her personal 
development in being open about 
her sexuality, writing about one 
of the first girls she knew she was 
attracted to. In an interview with 
VICE, Clairo discusses coming 
out a year ago and the authen-
ticity that comes with “Bags” in 
it being the first single she has 

released that allowed her to make 
music that feels personal. 
The single starts with a brief, 
ill-defined, ping-pong static that 
is quickly replaced with a consis-
tent drum pattern, pushing the 
listener through the whole song 
in a pleasantly subdued man-
ner. She not only captures the 
art of holding back, but wanting 
to savor, asking questions of how 
to enjoy something completely 
while still displaying restraint. 
The repetition of the lines “Walk-
ing out the door with your bags,” 
and “know you’d make fun of me” 
perfectly echoes the thoughts 
that run through your mind on a 
soap box, when you’re so damn 
attracted to someone but just 
can’t say anything. 
To bring this stretched-out 
analogy to full fruition, Clairo fol-
lows suit behind the likes of Tyler, 
the Creator and Kevin Abstract in 
referencing “CMBYN” with the 
lyrics: “All these little games, you 
can call me by the name I gave 
you yesterday.”
Clario has hit the final form 
of Soundcloud bedroom pop. 
She’s shed her first- and second-
stage attacks of the homemade 
sound with amped-up production 
(enlisting the help of co-producer 
Rostam Batmanglij), yet the sig-
nature daintiness of her voice, 
the soft aesthetic of her creative 
direction and, perhaps, her baby 
face, keep the listener inside the 
ethos of bedroom pop. This evo-
lution is phenomenal to witness, 
because she holds onto what cre-
ated the magnetic pull toward her 
in the first place, but then launch-
es into a more mature sound, 
opening up about her sexuality 
and bottled-up emotions. 
The most important compari-
son I can make between Clairo 
and Elio comes from the line after 
which the song is titled: “Walk-
ing out the door with your bags.” 
For both Clairo and Elio, a lover 
leaves and never comes back. 
But, it’s in those pangs of emo-
tion you feel when wrapped up in 
entanglement that are absolutely 
critical to your development and 
understanding of your sexual-
ity — and that’s why the story of 
unfulfilled love is being told in 
the first place.

side-by-side take

Nothing wrong about speaking my own language

Last January, a professor from Duke Uni-
versity sent emails to her Chinese interna-
tional students, asking them to not speak 
Chinese and “commit using English 100% 
of the time.” She stated that several faculty 
members are searching for students who had 
been speaking in Chinese in public spaces. 
In the emails, she also stated that they were 
“very loud,” and that the students are not 
taking the chance to learn English seriously, 
thus missing professional opportunities. It 
was that professor in specific who got media 
attention, but it should not be forgotten that 
she was a messenger for many other faculty 
members who thought the same way.
I found this incident especially relatable, as 
I once had been concerning if I was seen as 
so-called “FOB.” Short for ‘fresh off the boat,’ 

it is a slang referring to immigrants who have 
yet to abandon their culture and language and 
assimilate into the society in the diaspora. 
Personally, as an international student, I am 
not a big fan of my country of origin. My early 
experiences with living in a heteronormative 
atmosphere where anti-
quated cultural practices 
such as the Confucian 
hierarchy and authorita-
tive patriarchy are still 
abided by have strain 
had strained my iden-
tity as a Korean. This is 
why I initially wanted to 
erase Korean aspects of 
me and fit into the so-called “American” cul-
ture. However, as soon as I realized that this 
“American” thing was selective exclusion and 
hostile to certain foreign cultures after all.
People like to seek excuses to target minor-
ities. They bring up superficial words to deny 

their racist undertones. The faculty members 
brought up “noise” and volume to justify their 
selective hostility against these students. 
Even though many international students 
like me and those at Duke decide to pursue 
a higher education that primarily teaches in 
English, it does not nec-
essarily mean that we 
are willing to give up 
our native language and 
freedom of expression. 
Living in a country that 
preaches heavily on basic 
civil liberties, it should 
be up to the individual to 
decide which language 
they would like to speak. This incident seems 
to suggest otherwise. While I am condemn-
ing the professor who wrote the email in par-
ticular instead of the people who primarily 
warned the Chinese students, her decision 
to uphold her colleagues’ words and ways of 

conveying them was inevitable of criticism. 
She does not recognize how problematic and 
offensive it is to specify a certain language as 
loud and rude.
Living under institutions where systemic 
oppressions are so prevalent, incidents like 
this doesn’t surprise me. No one problematiz-
es the English language itself when domestic 
students, especially white and privileged stu-
dents, speaking loudly in “proper” English. 
This reminds me of a similar incident several 
years ago when one student publicly com-
plained about Asian students being loud in 
libraries. They are just unmannered students, 
not unmannered “Asian” students. This is all 
hate speech targeting the non-Western lan-
guages and cultures.
One thing I still do appreciate is that the 
professor has reassured me that there’s noth-
ing wrong about an international student 
speaking native languages, and I will do so 
even more publicly without any doubt.

Michigan women’s tennis falls in NCAA Singles Tournament

For the first time in Michigan 
history, three Wolverines were 
going to Orlando to compete in 
the NCAA Singles Tournament. 
However, with the three girls 
all ranked top-50 in the country, 
none of them made a serious run 
in the tournament. 
Seniors Kate Fahey and Brienne 
Minor, who also teamed up in the 
doubles tournament, made their 
third appearance in the NCAA 
singles tournament, while junior 
Chiara Lommer made her debut. 
Fahey was the No. 3 seed for the 
singles tournament, the highest 
seeding a Michigan player had 
ever earned. Her tournament 
performance, however, was quite 
uncharacteristic. 
Fahey, 
on 
a 

record-breaking winning streak, 
fell short to North Carolina’s Sara 
Daavettila on Monday.
She 
dropped 
a 
three-set 
match to bring an end to her 
incredible singles 
career. Fahey is 
Michigan’s 
all-
time 
leader 
in 
singles wins (132) 
and 
winning 
percentage 
(.815) 
after a 38-6 senior 
season.
She lost, 6-3, in 
the first set, but 
broke serve to start 
the second before 
holding off two break points in 
her next service game. She then 
kept the distance the rest of the 
way, wrapping up a 6-4 win in the 
second set to even the match. 

The third set, briefly interrupted 
due to heat caution, went back and 
forth until Fahey lost four straight 
games, eliminating her from the 
tournament. 
Minor returned 
to 
the 
singles 
tournament 
for 
the first time since 
winning the 2017 
NCAA 
singles 
title. She defeated 
No. 
48-ranked 
Olivia Hauger of 
California, 
6-1, 
6-4, 
to 
advance 
past 
the 
first 
round.
It was all Minor in the first 
set as she raced out to a 3-0 lead 
and never looked back in the 
6-1 first-set win. But she found 
herself in a 4-1 hole in the second 

before stringing together five 
consecutive games to pull out the 
victory.
The next round, Minor battled a 
hard-fought match, but ultimately 
fell to Illinois’ Asuka Kawai, 
ending her singles career at 
Michigan. 
Lommer notched the first upset 
of Monday, defeating No. 4-ranked 
Ingrid Gamarra Martins from 
South Carolina. Lommer had a 
timely break in the first set, going 
up 4-3. Riding the momentum 
from there, she came away with a 
6-3 first-set win. She then battled 
out the second set to win it, 6-3, as 
well. 
“Everyone is super good in that 
tournament,” Lommer said. “I 
knew that whoever I was going to 
play in the first round was going 
to be a tough match. I was pretty 

excited to see how I was going to 
compare — you know, she plays 
(No.) 1 for a top SEC team, so I just 
wanted to see how I would level 
up against her. Honestly, I felt 
pretty good.”
Though 
she 
lost 
in 
the 
next round to Hawaii’s Petra 
Melounova, 6-4, 6-1, Lommer is 
optimistic for her final year and 
her career ahead. 
“I think that I’m definitely 
ready for the challenge,” Lommer 
said. “I’m going to work on some 
areas of my game to make sure I’m 
totally ready for the transition. I’m 
excited. Of course I’m nervous, 
like, it’s always a big deal to try 
and play higher, but I’m definitely 
more excited than nervous. It’s 
a great opportunity and can 
hopefully transition to playing 
after school.”

Michigan finishes runner-up in National Championship run

When you think about fairytale 
endings to a doubles career, this is 
just about as close as you can get. 
Michigan senior duo Kate Fahey 
and Brienne Minor played their first 
and last NCAA doubles tournament 
together this past weekend, and, 
against all odds, finished second in 
the nation. 
Going 
into 
the 
tournament 
unranked and being seeded to play 
some extremely tough pairs, Fahey 
and Minor were just along for the 
ride. 
“We came into the tournament 
unseeded, so I thought we came in 
there without any pressure,” Minor 
said. “I don’t think anyone expected 
anything from us, so we kind of came 
in relaxed. We were just having fun 
on the court, especially being seniors, 
it was our last tournament together. 
We went out there and had fun and 
played to our strengths and did what 
we do best.”
Added Fahey: “(Minor) and I 
didn’t even know if we were going to 
get in. I mean, it was kind of on the 
fence, so we were just happy to get 
into the tournament. It’s a really huge 
tournament with the best players in 
the country, so we were really happy 
we got the last opportunity to play 
with each other. And I think we 

really just went one match at a time. 
We didn’t look forward, we didn’t 
look through anyone. We knew each 
match was going to be tough, and we 
really took care of it in each match.”
In their first tournament game, 
Fahey 
and 
Minor 
came 
away 
with a 6-1, 6-2 win over Virginia’s 
17th-ranked Meghan Kelley and Sofia 
Munera to advance the round of 16. 
The Wolverine pair went up a break 
at 2-1 and that was all it needed to 
take a first set win, 6-1.
Michigan grabbed an early 2-0 
lead before Virginia evened the 
match at two. Fahey held her next 
time back at the service line, with 
another Wolverine break to follow 
for a 4-2 lead. With the momentum 
in its favor, Michigan won the final 
two games to take a 6-2 lead. The 
Wolverines broke the Cavaliers in the 
final game, winning a deuce point to 
send Michigan to the second round.
The 
next 
round 
featured 
a 
matchup with 11th-ranked Elysia 
Bolton and Jada Hart of UCLA. 
Michigan took an early lead, then 
came through on two deuce points 
for a strong 4-2 advantage. Fahey 
and Minor got another break and 
then served out the set in the ensuing 
game for a 6-2 first-set win.
In the second set, the points went 
back and forth, allowing the Bruins 
to tie at three. The Wolverines then 
grabbed two break points on UCLA’s 

serve in the ninth game of that set. 
Tied at 5-4 with the opportunity to 
serve, the Bruins were able to break 
the Wolverines in the next game, 
tying the set at 5. The second set 
was sent into a tiebreaker. It was 
all Michigan in the breaker as the 
Wolverines won the first two points. 
That was all the distance Fahey and 
Minor needed to take a 7-2 win.
The victory made Fahey and Minor 
the first Michigan duo to advance 
to the quarterfinals of the doubles 
tournament in program history. By 
advancing to the quarterfinals, Fahey 
and Minor solidified All-American 
doubles honors.
Down to the round of eight, Fahey 
and Minor faced Georgia’s No. 28 
Katarina Jokic and Lourdes Carle. 
The first set featured three breaks of 
serve to start before Michigan held 
at love for a 3-1 lead. Both teams held 
serve the next time back before the 
Wolverines dominated off the deuce 
point of the Bulldogs’ serve for a big 
5-2 advantage. Michigan served out 
the set in the next game and secured 
a 6-2 win.
The second set started just like the 
first one did — the teams exchanged 
breaks to start. Georgia quickly 
capitalized for an early 3-1 lead. The 
Wolverines got the break right back, 
winning the deuce point on the 
Bulldogs’ next service game to get the 
ball back on their side, winning the 

point and tying at three. Georgia held 
on its serve and then broke Michigan 
on the deuce point to take a 5-3 lead. 
The Bulldogs won the next game 
to take the second set and send the 
match to a 10-point tiebreaker third 
set.
The Wolverines gained control 
early in the breaker set, grabbing a 
5-2 lead. Michigan held four match 
points following a 9-5 advantage, but 
Georgia answered back with three 
straight points to close the gap to 
just a point at 9-8. Michigan came 
through on the next point to wrap up 
a 10-8 win for the match.

Down to the Final Four, Minor 
and Fahey punched their ticket to 
the national championship match 
with a 6-2, 6-2 win over No. 3 Ingrid 
Gamarra Martins and Mia Horvit of 
South Carolina.
The Wolverines raced out to a 3-0 
lead in the first set and never looked 
back. The Gamecocks got on the 
board at 3-1, which ignited a run of 
four straight holds between the two 
teams. But Michigan came away with 
the final three points to win, 6-2.

Michigan loses to Nebraska, ending Big Ten Tournament run

There were two games and two 
stories Saturday for the No. 2 seed 
Michigan baseball team.
The Wolverines were fighting 
for their lives for the third day in 
a row after an opening day loss 
to Ohio State put them in the 
backdraw, where they walked-
off against No. 3 seed Illinois and 
beat No. 6 seed Maryland to set 
up a semifinal game with No. 5 
seed Nebraska. The Wolverines 
overwhelmingly won the first 
game, 18-8, but lost the second of 
the doubleheader, 7-3, therefore 
getting eliminated from the Big 
Ten Tournament.
But to get to the nightcap, 
Michigan had to come up with an 
early morning victory. And it was 
seemingly the only team awake as 
the Wolverines scored seven runs 
in the first inning and never looked 

back during the easy victory.
At night, though, the Wolverines 
didn’t race to an early lead.
Sophomore left-hander Angelo 
Smith was cool under pressure 
for the first eight outs of the game, 
breezing past batters with well-
placed sliders. But with two outs 
in the third, the Cornhuskers 
sandwiched a walk with two infield 
hits to load the bases before a 
single passed senior third baseman 
Blake Nelson for the first two runs 
of the game. Michigan halved the 
lead in the bottom of the inning, 
though, off of sophomore center 
fielder Jesse Franklin’s RBI single.
The fifth inning gave Nebraska 
one more run, when sophomore 
catcher Joe Donovan threw over 
second base to move Nebraska 
third baseman Angelo Altavilla 
from first to third with two outs. 
The next batter, Michigan native 
and 
Cornhuskers’ 
shortstop 
Spencer 
Schwellenbach, 
lifted 

a pitch to left field for his third 
RBI of the game, putting the 
Cornhuskers up 3-1.
The response was immediate 
from 
the 
Wolverines. 
Three 
straight singles loaded the bases 
and sophomore shortstop Jack 
Blomgren moved a runner in after 
being hit by a pitch. Senior first 
baseman Jimmy Kerr launched 
a 370-foot sacrifice fly to even 
the game 3-3, but two straight 
outs left runners on base, and an 
opportunity to grab their first lead 
of the game disappeared.
Nebraska scored twice the very 
next inning behind four walks to 
go up 5-3 in the sixth. Senior right-
hander Ben Keizer throwing the 
first two before allowing a double 
gave the Cornhuskers the lead 
and freshman right-hander Willie 
Weiss came on in relief, only to 
throw two more walks and give up 
yet another run.
The deficit grew as Michigan’s 

offense disappeared and walks 
continued to plague its pitchers.
Ending the night with 13 walks, 
the Wolverine bullpen had been 
worn down by five games in four 
days and were lucky to only lose 
by 4 — Nebraska left 16 runners 
on base. Smith could only go 4.2 

innings, and once he was gone, no 
one could adequately fill his shoes.
In 
the 
morning, 
Michigan 
showed it can outplay any team in 
the conference with ease. But at 
night, the Wolverines proved they 
can beat themselves as easily as 
they can beat others.

A season in review and what’s up next for Michigan softball

Last Monday, James Madison 
upset the Michigan softball team on 
its own field to punch a ticket to the 
Super Regional. After the handshake 
line, the Wolverines walked off 
the field for one final time, heads 
hanging low. For all an outright Big 
Ten regular season championship 
and conference tournament title are 
worth, Michigan felt as though it fell 
short.
In February, Michigan dipped 
below .500 at least six games into 
a season for the first time in nearly 
two decades. It posted an 0-4 record 
against ranked opponents, resulting 
in a brief exclusion from the national 
poll — a rarity for coach Carol 
Hutchins’ storied program. When 
the Wolverines returned to Ann 
Arbor for their first home game, they 
won 33 of their next 34 games. That 
streak set the stage for Michigan to 
host the NCAA Regional, where its 
season came to a screeching halt.
The 
Daily 
examines 
the 
Wolverines’ top performers, notable 
moments and underclassmen set to 
take on an increased role in 2020:
Co-MVPs: 
Freshman 
outfielder Lexie Blair and senior 
second baseman Faith Canfield
This one’s too close to call. Blair 
and Canfield were the driving forces 

behind this offense all season long. 
They each tallied 78 hits, finishing 
with respective batting averages 
of .406 and .404. Blair led the team 
with 54 RBI, while Canfield’s team-
high .482 on-base percentage gave 
Michigan a consistent leadoff spark. 
Blair and Canfield both finished 
either first or second on the team 
in batting average, on-base plus 
slugging, doubles, total bases and 
slugging percentage.
Numbers aside, this season gave 
Canfield a chance to pass the torch 
to the program’s next offensive 
cornerstone. 
As 
a 
freshman, 
Canfield studied 2016 National 
Player of the Year Sierra Romero 
during her senior campaign. In 2019, 
learning from Canfield — a two-time 
All-American — gave Blair a similar 
luxury.
Honorable 
mention: 
Sophomore left-hander Meghan 
Beaubien
Beaubien posted a 30-6 record 
while notching a 1.87 ERA and 229 
strikeouts en route to her second 
first-team All-Big Ten selection.
Breakout player: Senior first 
baseman Alex Sobczak
When Michigan began its season, 
Alex Sobczak’s name wasn’t on 
the starting lineup card. She lost 
a competition for the Wolverines’ 
everyday first baseman role in 
February, only to see limited action 

as a pinch hitter throughout the 
opening weekend.
But when she got her chance, 
she seized it. Sobczak turned in a 
breakout senior season, posting a 
.336 batting average — 78 points 
higher than her previous career-
high of .258 — and 42 RBI en route 
to second team All-Big Ten honors 
and an All-Big Ten Defensive Team 
selection. Her 10 home runs were 
tied for most on the team and she 
only trailed Blair in RBIs. Sobczak 
drew a team-high 27 walks, giving 
her an on-base percentage of .470 
that finished second to Canfield’s. 
More importantly, she came into 
her own as a leader and proved to 
be a key cog in Michigan’s Big Ten 
success.
Honorable 
mention: 
Senior 
designated 
player 
Mackenzie 
Nemitz
After 
recording 
just 
seven 
at-bats in her first three years and 
overcoming a torn ACL, Nemitz 
batted .288 and drove in 31 runs as 
a senior.
High 
point: 
Michigan 
defeats Minnesota in Big Ten 
Tournament championship
Before the Bloomington skies 
opened up, Michigan — which 
hadn’t won a Big Ten Tournament 
title since 2015 — held a 3-0 sixth-
inning lead against three-time 
defending champion Minnesota. 

Knowing they needed a win to host 
an NCAA Regional, the Wolverines 
looked locked in.
Then 
the 
downpour 
began. 
Following a 22-minute rain delay, 
the teams took the field for the two 
most important innings of their 
postseason resume.
The Golden Gophers stormed 
back, beginning the bottom of the 
sixth frame with a leadoff homer 
before tacking on another run with 
a sacrifice fly. Entering the seventh, 
Michigan found itself clinging to a 
one-run advantage. After walking 
Minnesota’s ninth batter on a full 
count, freshman right-hander Alex 
Storako induced a trio of fly outs 
to seal the 3-2 victory. With that, 
the Wolverines clinched their 10th 
conference tournament title in 
program history.
Low point: James Madison 
eliminates 
Michigan 
at 
Ann 
Arbor regional
Entering the final day of the 
NCAA Regional, the Wolverines 
needed only one win to advance. In 
the other dugout, James Madison 
needed to force and sweep a 
doubleheader to survive. On an 
afternoon brimming with potential, 
Michigan struggled mightily at 
the plate. For the second straight 
day, Dukes’ ace Megan Good — 
a finalist for the 2019 National 
Player of the Year award — shut 

down 
the 
Wolverines’ 
offense. 
In 26 total innings against Good, 
Michigan managed just two runs. 
Good prevented 23 baserunners 
from scoring, holding Blair and 
Canfield to a combined 3-for-23 in 
the process. To the dismay of the 
Wolverine faithful at Alumni Field, 
James Madison ultimately punched 
its ticket to the Super Regional while 
Michigan became the nation’s only 
seeded team that failed to advance.
Who’s next in line?
Familiarize yourself with the 
names Lou Allan, Hannah Carson, 
Taylor Bump and Morgan Overaitis. 
This quartet of underclassmen 
played sparingly in 2019, but showed 
impressive potential when given the 
chance. Allan, Carson and Overaitis 
were each tabbed top-25 prospects 
in FloSoftball’s recruiting rankings. 
Bump, 
meanwhile, 
has 
played 
three different infield positions and 
showed flashes of elite defense since 
arriving as 2017’s No. 64 recruit.
Carson figures to slide into the 
starting backstop role following 
senior catcher Katie Alexander’s 
graduation, while Allan and Bump 
are candidates to replace Sobczak 
and Nemitz at first base and 
designated player. Overaitis could 
assume the starting second baseman 
duties with Canfield’s career in the 
books, but may also see playing time 
on the left side of the infield.

Report: Luke Yaklich to accept assistant coaching position at Texas

Luke Yaklich built up Michigan 
from a defensive liability to a 
defensive 
powerhouse. 
Now, 
he’ll try to work that same magic 
at Texas.
Shortly 
after 
coach 
John 
Beilein left Michigan to become 
the coach of the Cleveland 
Cavaliers, Yaklich, too, will leave 
after accepting a position as an 
assistant coach of the Longhorns, 
per a report from CBS Sports’ 
Jon Rothstein. A call to Yaklich 
went unreturned and a Michigan 
spokesperson did not respond to 
a request for comment.
Yaklich also interviewed for 
the Wolverines’ head coaching 
job on May 17, but was not 
offered the position. Instead, the 
job went to former player Juwan 

Howard — known as a defensive 
guru during his time as an 
assistant with the NBA’s Miami 
Heat. Beilein was primarily an 
offensive coach, necessitating 
the presence of someone like 
Yaklich to serve as a defensive 
coordinator of sorts. The same 
isn’t necessarily true of Howard.
Losing Yaklich hurts in more 
ways than one. He was a teacher 
at his core, and his specialty was 
getting even the biggest skeptics 
to care about defense. When 
he got buy-in at Michigan, the 
defense turned around in just one 
season. Having two defensive 
stalwarts 
in 
guard 
Zavier 
Simpson and center Jon Teske 
still in tow, and a new coach in 
Howard who has defense as his 
calling card, may prevent too 
big of a defensive drop-off, but a 
ripple effect could come in other 

ways.
When a head coach leaves 
in the offseason — especially 
in mid-May — it’s often the 
first domino that can lead to 
assistants subsequently finding 
new positions, as Yaklich did, 
and often causes a string of 
decommits and transfers who 
realize that the program no 
longer looks like the one they 
originally committed to. Yaklich 
was a strong recruiter who 
formed bonds with many of his 
players, and some could decide 
that without Yaklich, they’d 
rather be elsewhere.
Yaklich was originally hired 
from Illinois State prior to 
the 2017 season. With him, 
the Wolverines finished their 
seasons 
ranked 
third 
and 
second, respectively, in adjusted 
defensive efficiency, according 

to KenPom. In 10 previous 
seasons under Beilein, they had 
never finished better than 37th.
Reports 
have 
stated 
that 
Howard 
is 
looking 
for 
an 
experienced assistant to round 

out the first-time head coach’s 
staff.
But replacing Yaklich will be 
a mammoth task and now, the 
clock is ticking for Howard to do 
just that.

How Juwan Howard secured Cole Bajema’s recommitment

The past week has been, as 
Shane Bajema puts it, quite 
simply “a blur.”
But at the end of it all, Cole 
Bajema — Shane’s son and a 2019 
four-star wing — recommitted 
to the Wolverines on Friday 
night, 11 days after John Beilein 
left Michigan to become the 
Cleveland Cavaliers’ head coach.
With the decision to recommit, 
Bajema currently stands as new 
coach Juwan Howard’s only 
commitment in the 2019 class, 
making him a critical piece of 
Michigan’s puzzle for 2019 and 
beyond.
“The 
departure 
of 
Coach 
Beilein came as a big surprise,” 
Bajema tweeted Friday night. 
“Given coach Beilein recruited 
me, I am sad to see him go but 
fully support him in his new 
venture at the Cavaliers. I cannot 
thank 
the 
entire 
Michigan 
basketball staff enough for their 
support.
“Having patiently waited for 
Michigan to name its new head 
coach, I am very excited Juwan 
Howard is the new head coach. 
I believe he will uphold the 
great culture, that is Michigan 
basketball. I know there’s a lot 
of speculation out there but I 
am ALL IN for coach Howard 

and ready to report in June! Go 
Blue!”
The decision to recommit, 
though, wasn’t always so simple. 
Bajema has been committed 
to 
Michigan 
since 
Aug. 
14 
of last year, but the original 
commitment came to Beilein, 
who Shane described as having 
done “a great job of preparing 
Cole 
for 
the 
entire 
college 
experience.” But after 11 days of 
calls from Beilein and Howard, 
as well as athletic director Warde 
Manuel and the Wolverines’ 
assistant coaches, Bajema felt 
confident that the program he 
will be entering next season is 
the same one he committed to 
nearly a year ago.
Bajema did not respoond to 
a text from The Daily Saturday 
morning. He has yet to make 
any public comment outside of 
Twitter since Beilein announced 
his departure.
“The key factor in Cole coming 
to the University of Michigan was 
really a coaching compatibility 
decision at a great university,” 
Shane told The Daily. “Then, 
when that transition goes off 
and you wonder what’s gonna be 
next, it’s all about relationships 
and trust and continuity with 
the next coach. … But I think 
they made a great decision in 
choosing another person to carry 
out the legacy, of what is more 

than just Beilein’s legacy, but the 
Michigan legacy.”
Critically, Howard was not the 
only one to reach out to Bajema 
after his hiring. Amidst the 
blurred flurry of conversations 
with those inside the program, 
Shane doesn’t remember exactly 
when the first call came, but he 
knows it came from Manuel. 
And as Manuel talked, Shane’s 
confidence in Michigan came 
rushing back.
Going 
into 
the 
call, 
he 
wasn’t familiar with Howard 
as a person, but he quickly 
felt 
Manuel 
made 
a 
“great 
decision,” continuing the legacy 
and culture that Beilein built. 
Shortly 
thereafter, 
Howard, 
too, reached out, confirming his 
interest in Cole as a key player in 
the transition from Beilein to the 
future.
“Juwan and (Cole) had a 
conversation 
and 
basically 
agreed that Cole’s his first real 
recruit in his college coaching 
career,” Shane said. “The baton, 
basically, handed from Beilein 
to Juwan in recruitment of Cole 
and that’s what really put Cole 
over the edge and reassured that 
he could become Juwan’s guy 
too.
“… It was genuine, it was real, 
it wasn’t this recruiting talk. 
(Howard) is genuinely ecstatic 
to be the coach. And he seemed 

genuinely pumped to have Cole.”
And 
when 
Beilein 
called, 
telling the Bajemas that “Juwan’s 
gonna be a great guy,” and calling 
it “a perfect fit,” the comfort 
level only grew.
Then, 
Friday 
afternoon, 
the final boost came when 
Howard announced that Jon 
Sanderson would be staying on 
as the Wolverines’ strength and 
conditioning coach. Sanderson 
and Shane have developed a 
close relationship throughout 
the recruiting process, as he 
has become one of Cole’s key 
recruiters.
And though Cole’s workouts 

with Sanderson haven’t begun 
yet, his personal trainer back 
home is a friend of Sanderson’s 
and has helped him add 22 
pounds over the past seven 
months.
“As a future mentor of players 
and our son, Cole, I can not 
say more good things about 
(Sanderson),” Shane said. “Could 
you ask for a more ideal person to 
train Cole’s physical body in the 
future?”
Starting a few weeks from 
now, when Cole reports to Ann 
Arbor for Michigan’s summer 
bridge program, Sanderson will 
be doing just that. Officially.
