Recently, 
the 
University 

of Michigan Central Student 
Government has been working 
with Ann Arbor City Council 
to 
increase 
student 
political 

participation in city elections, 
especially following concerns on 
campus about how the council’s 
decisions 
affect 
University 

students.

Efforts by CSG in 2015 resulted 

in a town hall proposal to City 
Council to place election reform 
proposals 
on 
the 
upcoming 

November 
ballot 
for 
voter 

consideration. 
The 
proposed 

reforms would have involved 

moving city primary elections 
to November, and making both 
mayoral and council member 
elections 
nonpartisan. 
The 

proposal failed with the City 
Council, however, by a 7-4 vote.

Public Policy senior Nadine 

Jawad, CSG senior policy advisor, 
is working on initiatives to 
continue discussing the potential 
of switching from partisan to 
nonpartisan elections for City 
Council, which she says will 
increase enfranchisement and 
give the students a greater voice in 
city matters that affect their time 
in Ann Arbor.

“We believe that students 

should have a greater relationship 
with the city, and it makes it a lot 
easier for students to get involved 

A 
violent 
attack 
on 
the 

Ohio State University campus 
last November prompted the 
University of Michigan Division 
of Public Safety and Security to 
make safety precautions more 
available for University students, 
staff and community members.

The incident involved Ohio 

State student Abdul Razak Ali 
Artan, who drove a car into a 
crowded area next to a campus 
building and proceeded to attack 
people with a butcher’s knife, 
resulting in 11 people requiring 
medical attention. While this was 
not an active shooter situation, 
the incident — in addition to 
other recent violent incidents at 
other schools around the country 
— increased concern about the 
potential dangers of emergency 
situations at the University.

To 
prepare 
students 
and 

faculty for an active shooter on 
campus, DPSS expanded their 
offer for safety presentations upon 
request. These presentations are 
currently not mandatory for all 
faculty members, but requests are 
accepted year-round and can be 
made by any student organization 
or staff unit.

DPSS 
spokeswoman 
Diane 

Brown 
wrote 
in 
an 
email 

interview DPSS gave several 
dozen 
active 
shooter 
threat 

presentations in 2016. Brown also 
noted DPSS expanded its active 
shooter 
education 
materials, 

though requests for presentations 

have remained fairly consistent 
over the last semester.

“We have been training for 

the ‘Run, Hide or Fight’ protocol 
for a couple of years,” Brown 
wrote. “Last semester, we added 
to our materials for the training, 
creating the UM video on the web 
and revising the postcard that 
highlights the basics. Requests for 
presentations have continued to 
be steady.”

DPSS encourages the “Run, 

Hide, Fight” protocol, which has 

been the focus of its training over 
the past couple of years. This 
method instructs onlookers to 
use an escape path to move away 
from the imminent threat, which 
is taught as the first and best 
option on many college campuses, 
including Ohio State. The message 
“Run, Hide, Fight” was sent out 
to students via text during the 
November attack on the Ohio 
State campus.

“Run, Hide, Fight” protocol 

educators advise if leaving the 

scene is not possible, hiding 
should be the next response, 
which would involve locking 
and securing doors, creating 
barricades and remaining quiet, 
out-of-sight and with your cell 
phone on silent. As a last resort, 
fighting may be necessary to 
disrupt 
or 
incapacitate 
the 

shooter. If fighting is the only 
available option, it’s best to be 
aggressive, provide distractions 
and disarm the shooter.

University 
of 
Michigan 

community members responded 
to a new policy that allows new 
names 
to 
be 
considered 
for 

academic buildings with praise and 
opposition.

After a year of consideration and 

planning, the President’s Advisory 
Committee on University History 
unveiled a new process to review 
requests to change the names of 
buildings on campus. The intent of 
the policy — approved by University 
President Mark Schlissel earlier 
this week — is to address the 
dismay associated with buildings 
named after individuals who were 
known to have discriminated 
against minorities.

In a University press release, 

Schlissel 
emphasized 
the 

thoroughness 
of 
the 
request 

reviewing process.

“It is immensely important to 

me, and to the entire university 
community, 
that 
we 
take 
a 

scholarly approach to any review 
of historical building names and 
put that review in the appropriate 
context,” he stated.

Students and political organizations react to concerns over free speech in the classroom

LSA junior Enrique Zalamea, 

the president of the University 
of Michigan’s chapter of College 
Republicans, has a poster up in his 
room that reads, “Came to college, 
still not a liberal.” He said it stems 

from a joke, but the words on the 
poster mean a great deal to him. 
After all, it hasn’t been easy to 
defend his conservative views on 
campus.

“It’s playing off that joke that 

college makes people more liberal, 
and when you think about it, it’s 
true,” Zalamea said. “It all boils 
down to (how) liberalism is taught 

like a fact as opposed to an opinion.”

Zalamea is not alone in thinking 

some professors have a tendency to 
lean toward liberal ideologies. This 
became apparent in November, 
when conservative advocacy group 
Turning Point USA published a list 
of professors on a website called 
Professor Watchlist.

The mission of the website, 

according to its homepage, is to 
collect the names of university 
faculty from across the nation 
who 
“discriminate 
against 

conservative 
students 
and 

advance leftist propaganda in the 
classroom.” Anyone can submit a 
tip of a professor they feel meets this

On Jan. 24, after a year-long 

search for new leadership, the 
University of Michigan’s University 
Musical 
Society 
announced 

Matthew 
VanBesien, 
current 

executive director of the New York 
Philharmonic, will serve as its 
seventh president. VanBesien will 
assume the position, currently held 
by Kenneth Fischer, in July.

After 30 years as president, 

Fischer kept his distance from the 
search committee, focusing on his 
last season with UMS. The 2016-
2017 UMS performers include the 
Berlin 
Philharmonic, 
Batsheva 

Dance Company, Meredith Monk 
and Yo-Yo Ma.

Fischer has been the president 

of UMS since 1987. Since then, the 
organization quadrupled its budget, 
established stronger engagement 
between the University and the 
local community, and became the 
only University arts presenter to 
receive the National Medal of Arts 
from former President Barack 
Obama.

President 
Donald 
Trump 

recently announced his plan to 
enact a wide-ranging ban on 
refugees entering the United 
States, according to a draft of his 
executive orderobtained by The 
New York Times.

The order, which Trump is 

expected to sign soon, would 
place a ban on all refugees for at 
least 120 days, with an indefinite 
ban 
on 
those 
from 
Syria. 

Additionally, the executive order 
instills a complete 30-day freeze 
on all immigration –– regardless 
of refugee status –– from the 
predominantly Muslim countries 
of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, 
Sudan, Syria and Yemen. After 
the 120 days are up, an extension 
of the order notwithstanding, 
the 
refugee 
program 
would 

shrink the number of refugees 

allowed into the United States 
from 110,000 refugees per year to 
50,000. 

In response to news of the 

expected ban, the Michigan 
Refugee Assistance Program, a 
University of Michigan student 
organization created this year, 
issued a Facebook postopposing 
the order. The post, which stated 
that the order “risks repeating 
mistakes of the past when the 
United States tragically turned 
away Jewish refugees in World 
War II,” included a link to a 
document providing information 
on how to contact lawmakers and 
newspapers in order to oppose 
the ban.

College Republicans president 

Enrique Zalamea, an LSA junior, 
hailed the speed of Trump’s 
executive orders. 

“Its so rare to see such action 

happening so quickly, and I’m 
really glad to see real changes 

occurring,” he said. “ I know 
right now the vetting process is 
already pretty strict, but just to 
create those additional firewalls 
is always welcome when you’re 
talking 
about 
our 
national 

security.” 

Rackham 
student 
Andrea 

Gillespie, 
an 
education 
and 

advocacy co-chair for MRAP, 
warned against the politicization 
of the refugee crisis.

“We don’t see this as a partisan 

issue,” she said. “What we see is 
a dangerous political climate and 
an issue of human dignity. And 
I think now more than ever in 
this current climate we have to 
remain active and vigilant, and 
make sure that we’re having our 
voices heard and that refugees’ 
voices are heard.”

Although most of its work has 

revolved around assisting already-
resettled refugees, Gillespie said 
in light of the expected refugee 

ban, MRAP would be taking 
a more advocacy-based role, 
trying to keep the resettlement 
process alive.

“We feel like now more 

than ever is when we need 
to be advocates in a social 
space 
for 
refugees, 
and 

that 
includes 
contacting 

every single representative 
that we can, calling the 
White 
House, 
talking 
to 

the State Department, who 
runs 
refugee 
resettlement 

programs,” Gillespie said. “I 
think that we were walking 
a tight line before and I think 
now that line is essentially 
blurred with the comments 
coming out, the potential ban 
on Muslim refugees, especially 
considering 
the 
fact 
that 

Michigan itself has such a 
strong attachment to refugee 
resettlement and all of the 
benefits that come from it.”

In November 2015, following 

the Paris terrorist attacks in 
which 129 were killed.

The University of Michigan 

isn’t the only one celebrating a 

milestone birthday this year: 

The state of Michigan also 

marked the 180th anniversary 

of its admission to the United 

States on Thursday.

According to a historical 

marker outside the present-

day courthouse on East Huron 

Street, Ann Arbor played an 

important role in Michigan’s 

statehood when a convention in 

1836 at the Washtenaw County 

courthouse met to discuss a 

proposal from Congress to 

resolve a dispute between 

Michigan and Ohio about 

border territory.

“Both (Michigan and Ohio) 

claimed a narrow strip of land, 

including the present city of 

Toledo,” the marker states. 

“Congress proposed giving 

the greater part of the Upper 

Peninsula to Michigan, while 

awarding the ‘Toledo Strip’ to 

Ohio.”

Once the dispute was 

resolved and supported at 

the convention, it cleared the 

way for the Congressional 

bill and then-President 

Andrew Jackson’s signing of 

the bill making the roughly 

200,000-person territory the 

26th state in the Union.

After this landmark 

decision, Ann Arbor further 

cemented its location as 

one of importance when the 

University also moved from 

Detroit in 1837. The first 

students enrolled in 1841 and 

the University started that year 

with a total of seven students.

After 180 years of 

statehood, Michigan now has a 

population of 9.9 million people 

and the University has grown 

to encompass about 51,000 

students between its Ann 

Arbor, Dearborn and Flint 

campuses, a vast growth since 

its humble beginnings in 1837.

in the democratic process without 
the constraints of having to put a 
label on yourself like Democrat or 
Republican,” Jawad said.

Jawad also co-authored the 

resolution urging Ann Arbor to 
switch to nonpartisan November 
elections. At CSG’s first meeting 
of the winter semester, the 
resolution passed 27-5 with five 
abstentions and no additional 
amendments. It pointed out the 
University’s size makes students 
a key constituency in Ann Arbor, 
and reiterated the need for 
student civil engagement. It also 
mentioned students’ historically 
low voter turnout rate, which has 
been under 20 percent the past 
few years.

“Ann Arbor is one of only three 

cities in the state of Michigan that 
has partisan primary elections and 

general elections in November, 
Ionia and Ypsilanti being the 
other two, and … students, one of 
the largest constituencies in Ann 
Arbor, are largely unable to vote 
in the August Primary elections 
as most students are not on 
campus during the summer,” the 
resolution states.

Councilmember Kirk Westphal 

(D–Ward 2) agreed nonpartisan 
elections would be beneficial to 
Ann Arbor residents. He argued 
since most residents vote straight-
ticket Democrat, the meaningful 
choice would occur during the 
August primaries, when most 
students are gone, rather than the 
November general elections.

“Ten out of 11 members on 

(City Council) are Democrats,” 
Westphal said. “Part of the logic 
for nonpartisan elections on the 
local level is that more people will 
be making a meaningful choice in 
effectively a one-party town in the 
general elections.”

However, 
Councilmember 

Zach Ackerman (D–Ward 3) said 
a candidate’s party affiliation 
is crucial in communicating a 
candidate’s values.

“I believe parties are a critical 

identifier of values,” Ackerman 
wrote in an email. “While there 
may be no partisan way to plow 
roads or pick up trash, there is a 
reason we do not have to debate 
how we treat our immigrant, 
LBGTQ, 
and 
low-income 

neighbors.”

Increasing 
anxieties 
about 

recent price surges in off-campus 
housing for University students 
is one motive for CSG’s ongoing 
efforts to convince City Council 
to approve election reform and 
a stronger dialogue between 
the city and the students. Since 
the University only guarantees 
on-campus housing to freshmen 
students, many struggle to find 
suitable houses or apartments.

site.

Two of the people on the

Exposing students to all 

points of view

The idea of Professor Watchlist 

first came up this past summer. 
Matt Lamb, Turning Point USA’s 
director of campus integrity, 
helped start the list following one 
of the organization’s conferences 
for 
high-school 
and 
college 

students.

“We’d been hearing all these 

stories about professors lashing 
out at students or professors 
putting odd things on Twitter,” 
Lamb 
said. 
“We 
thought: 

‘Wouldn’t it be great if there was 
one place we could put all of these 
stories?’ It would be really great 
for students to see what’s going on 
at these campuses, or campuses 
they’re considering going to.”

Lamb’s main concern is not that 

professors have political opinions, 
but that they aren’t presenting 
both sides of the issue in the 
classroom. He wants to use the 
website to reach out to students 
and notify them of professors on 
their campuses who might not be 
receptive to their views, or even 
respectful of them.

“We know we’re not going to 

change the professors’ minds, 
but it’s more (about) getting our 
point of view out to students who 
are still forming their political 
opinions and might be more 
willing to listen to us,” Lamb 
said. “Professors are supposed to 
encourage debate. If a professor 
wants to present a liberal point 
of view, that’s absolutely fine, 
but present it in such a way that 
encourages debate, not shuts it 
down.”

“It’s an odd time we’re in 

right now”

In order to keep the site 

verifiable, 
Lamb 
only 
posts 

submissions 
that 
come 
with 

proof that the professor in 
question actually wrote, said 
or did something to attack 
conservative 
views. 
Douglas’s 

name is accompanied by a link 
to a commentary about an 
article she wrote for the political 
commentary website “In These 
Times,” in which she stated that 
she hated Republicans.

“I hate Republicans,” Douglas 

wrote in the 2014 editorial. “I 
can’t stand the thought of having 
to spend the next two years 
watching 
Mitch 
McConnell, 

John Boehner, Ted Cruz, Darrell 
Issa or any of the legions of other 
blowhards 
denying

change, thwarting immigration 
reform or championing fetal 
‘personhood.’ ” She then went on 
to say she misses the days when 
people of two different political 
parties could have respectful, 
impactful discourse.

Douglas said she found out 

her name was featured on the 
Watchlist through an email from 
a colleague. When she first heard 
the news, she wasn’t quite sure 
how to feel.

“It’s an odd time we’re in right 

now,” Douglas said. “On the one 
hand, you feel what the intent of 
this is. Even though the founders 
of the site said that their intent is 
not to suppress expression, clearly 
that’s one of the things they’re 
trying to do. And in these times, 
one has to take those concerns 

seriously. And on the other hand, 
I looked at it and was like, ‘I’m 
not going to take this seriously,’ 
because these people have never 
taken a class with me — they’ve 
never seen what I’m like in a 
class.”

What Douglas found most 

intriguing about the situation was 
that her article was actually meant 
to lament the partisan divide the 
country currently faces. The title 
she wrote was “We Can’t All Just 
Get Along,” but it was changed 
by her editors to “It’s Okay to 
Hate Republicans” — without her 
consent — before it was published. 
The title has since been changed 
back to Douglas’s original line.

However, 
Lamb 
felt 
the 

intention of the piece wasn’t as 
important as its content. And 
although he’d never sat in on 
one of Douglas’s classes, he was 
concerned with how the article 
might seep into her lessons.

“She said: ‘I hate Republicans.’ 

Well, okay, you can say that, but 
if you’re teaching a class and 
you have a Republican in your 
classroom, what position does 
that put them in?” Lamb said. “I 
know she said she didn’t like the 
title, but there’s still a line in her 
editorial … you kind of assume 
that creeps into the classroom 
when these things come up.”

Douglas, 
however, 
isn’t 

convinced her outside writing 
affects the way she teaches. 
And while she notes it would be 
impossible to know the political 
affiliation of every student in 
her classroom, she does her best 
to encourage them to look at all 
points of view.

“There are faculty whose 

scholarship often informs their 
teaching, but who can be public 
intellectuals and write about 
things that never come up in 
the classroom,” Douglas said. 
“I wouldn’t bring it up in the 
classroom because it would never 
be appropriate … When I teach 
a class of 300 students, I can’t 
know all of their political views. 
That just doesn’t happen. And 
I don’t care what it is. What I 
care about is teaching them how 
to think analytically about the 
media.”

Juan Cole, who is also on the 

Watchlist, was targeted for a 
blog article he wrote in 2015 in 
response to the Charleston, S.C. 
church shooting. According to 
Professor Watchlist, Cole asserted 
right-wing Jews and a culture of 
Islamophobia contributed helped 
inspire the shooter, Dylann Roof. 
Cole declined to comment for the 
Daily.

“Faculty have the right and 

duty to teach controversial 
subjects”

In the history department, 

Prof. John Carson, the director 
of 
undergraduate 
studies, 
is 

responsible for handling any 
curriculum issues that might 
arise. 
This 
would 
include 

complaints 
of 
a 
professor 

attacking or even not bringing 
up the other side of a political 
debate. Carson said he had not 
had any curriculum complaints 
in his two-and-a-half years as 
director, but the department 
makes sure students are hearing 
the analytical argument, not the 
professor’s opinion.

“If a student found something 

controversial, we might talk to 
the professor and make sure 
things were being presented in a 
scholarly way that accentuates not 
passions, but scholarly analysis,” 
Carson said. “And as long as that’s 
the case, faculty have the right 
and duty to teach controversial 
subjects.”

Carson was upset to see the list 

online in November. As a friend 
and colleague of Cole, Carson 
stood by him when he was added 
to a similar site, Campus Watch, 
in 2002, and he decided to submit 
his own name to the website in a 
show of solidarity.

He was not alone in this: 

Professors from all across the 
country submitted their names 
to the site in droves, saying if the 
purpose of the list was to target 
academic freedom and shame 
faculty who teach ideas Turning 
Point rejected, they wanted their 
names added, too.

When Lamb received the 

submissions, he wasn’t amused. 
He deleted the spam submissions, 
but said it didn’t deter him from 
working on the site. In fact, he felt 
the swell of professors turning 
themselves in only proved the list 
wasn’t a threat to their freedom at 
all.

“Professors would send in tips 

… which I think confirms our 
point, and dispels the myth that a 
lot of these teacher organizations 
are 
promoting 
that 
this 
is 

somehow a threat to academic 
freedom,” Lamb said. “But you 
wouldn’t want to be on a list if 
you thought this is a threat to 
academic freedom, so I just take 
this as an acknowledgement that 
they’re lying, and that this is not 
a threat.”

Communications 
Prof. 

Kristen 
Harrison, 
the 

department’s associate director 
of undergraduate studies, agreed 
with Lamb that the list probably 
isn’t a threat to anyone’s freedom. 
However, she did see it as a way 
to scare professors out of sharing 
certain ideas — albeit a way that is 
probably futile.

“The Professor Watchlist is 

an intimidation tactic,” Harrison 
said. “There’s nothing to watch 
… professors are usually a pretty 
benign group, and our most 
radical actions are written down. 
And so you go into the library 
and find a book and say ‘Wow, 
I disagree with that,’ and that’s 
pretty much the best way to resist 
our ideas.”

LSA junior Collin Kelly, the 

chair of the University’s chapter 
of College Democrats, also felt 
the list isn’t going to accomplish 
much, and his professors seem 
to be making every effort to 
encourage debate and differing 
viewpoints.

“Every professor I’ve had has 

gone out of their way to advocate 
for both sides, and make sure 
they weren’t taking one side of 
the story or the other,” Kelly 
said. “Then again, I don’t identify 
as conservative … But calling 
(professors) out without trying 
to create some sort of dialogue 
seems very shortsighted and kind 
of inflammatory.”

Zalamea said he’s never had 

a problem with any professors 
discouraging his beliefs, and he 
hasn’t heard of that happening 
to any of his classmates, either. 
In fact, he feels he can still make 
meaningful relationships with 
professors, even when they don’t 
share his opinions. He said he 
wouldn’t use the list to avoid 
certain professors or classes, 
though he doesn’t necessarily 
think it’s a bad idea.

“If you’re a student who thinks 

it’s so important to take a class 
where the professor aligns with 
your political views, it helps,” 
Zalamea said. “I don’t think it 
necessarily reflects a division, 
but it reflects being on a liberal 
campus and wanting to be with 
people who share your political 
beliefs.”

Terry McDonald, director of the 
Bentley Historical Library, said the 
development of the process is part 
of a larger national conversation 
on controversial building names 
and legacies on college campuses. 
In 2015, Georgetown University 
renamed two buildings originally 
named for school presidents who 
sold slaves to settle debts, while 
Yale University came under fire last 
summer for housing students in a 
residence hall named after John C. 
Calhoun, one of the most prominent 
defenders of slavery in the decades 
preceding the Civil War.

“There has been a tremendous 

national consideration of questions 
about whether or not buildings 
should be named after people whose 
actions in their own time were 
controversial,” 
McDonald 
said. 

“One important context of this is 
the national reconsideration of what 
it means when you memorialize 
someone on your campus, which is 
different than teaching history or 

something like that.”

Any member of the University 

community can submit a proposal 
to the president to change the name 
of a building. The president then 
decides whether to refer the case 
to the committee. The committee 
developed several guiding principles 
with which they may evaluate 
the proposal including pedagogy, 
interpretation, due diligence and 
consistency.

McDonald 
specifically 

highlighted 
the 
principle 
of 

pedagogy, which maintains that 
the names of University buildings 
should allow students to learn 
about history and people who have 
contributed to the school.

“Every name is a teachable 

moment,” he said. “Our question 
is: ‘What is it that this name 
teaches on this campus? Why 
would that name be important to 
be remembered?’”

Former Physics Prof. Jens Zorn 

wrote in an email interview he 
disagrees with the former Dennison 
Building’s name switch to Weiser 
Hall in 2014 after a significant 
donation from Regent Ron Weiser.

“My main issue is that we are 

diminishing the history of our 
University by entirely removing the 
name of an honored, distinguished 
professor from a building that 
has carried that name for many 
decades,” Zorn wrote.

The high-rise section of the 

building is undergoing a renovation 
and will no longer be used for 
physics studies like it was in the past, 
while the lower portion will remain 
unchanged.

Zorn wrote he agrees with 

changing the name of the high-rise 
portion to Weiser to recognize the 
donor. However, he opposes the 
name change of the lower portion of 
the building, seeing as that portion is 
not undergoing a change.

“The low-rise portion is clearly 

separate; its appearance is not 
being altered,” he wrote. “Its use for 
physics education remains much as 
it was for many years. My colleagues 
and I believe that the low-rise 
building should retain the Dennison 
name. 

RENAMING

— where people come from, their 
ethnic heritage, what their interests 
are, sexual orientation — I want 
students to see the Musical Society 
as part of what they can be proud 
of,” Fischer said. “We want students 
to come and learn about the world 
by experiencing what it is we bring 
to the stage.”

When Aaron Dworkin, dean 

of the School of Music, Theatre 
& Dance, was a student at the 
University, Fischer was a mentor 
in his career-building. Dworkin 
said he benefitted in his personal 
professional development, as well 
as organizational benefits, from 
Fischer’s leadership once he became 
dean.

“It’s incredibly honoring and 

exciting to be part of bringing 
some voice to this new transition,” 

Dworkin said. “I’m so excited that 
Matthew will succeed. No one 
can replace Ken, but someone can 
succeed Ken. As I think around the 
world, I can think of no one better.”

VanBesien 
echoed 
Dworkin’s 

sentiments. 

“I think item number one is to 

uphold a legacy of Ken and all that 
he has done during his time there,” 
VanBesien said. “The UMS team 
is staggeringly good. They’re great 
colleagues, they’re great people and 
are great at what they do. So what 
I hope to bring to the equation is 
some additional perspectives from 
my own career — not only work and 
think creatively together about what 
the next chapter for UMS will be, 
but what it’ll be for the University 
of Michigan, for Ann Arbor and 
southeast Michigan.”

Fischer 
emphasized 
the 

alignment of VanBesien’s vision 
with UMS’s goals.

“The Music Society is the oldest 

of our kind in the country at 138 
years,” Fischer said. “His (New 
York Philharmonic) is the oldest 
orchestra in this country, so he has 
great appreciation for tradition. 
But he’s an innovator — he’s done 
interesting things with the New 
York Philharmonic and now he’s 
going to want to do the same sorts of 
things here and that’s what excites 
me.”

Music, Theatre & Dance junior 

Joshua 
Devries 
studies 
cello 

performance at the University and 
spoke about the new opportunities 
VanBesien’s leadership will bring.

“The New York Philharmonic 

is heavily involved in educational 
opportunities 
throughout 
New 

York, so knowing that the new 
UMS (director) will have those 
experiences 
and 
bring 
that 

perspective to UMS is a good sign,” 
Devries said.

Brown said incoming freshmen 

in each new student orientation last 
summer as well as fall orientation 
learned the protocol.

Many students, however, still 

don’t feel prepared. LSA freshman 
Sam Allen was not sure about the 
proper response in an active shooter 
situation, 
despite 
having 
gone 

through the training last summer.

“Honestly, I’m not sure about 

the official protocol,” she said. “I 
feel like there is a general idea of 
staying hidden, but I wouldn’t have 
any official plan if I found myself in a 
situation that. I guess I haven’t really 
thought about it.”

Research released by the Harvard 

School of Public Health faculty in 
2015 found mass public shootings 
have steadily increased over the last 
five years. According to Everytown, 
a gun safety lobbying group, there 
have been more than 200 school 
shootings since 2013, 47 percent 
of which took place on college or 
university campuses.

DPSS 
has 
updated 
its 

presentations as recently as last 
semester to include more training 
materials. Additions include a UM 
active 
shooter 
response 
video, 

available on the DPSS website, that 
details how to appropriately respond 
to an active shooter situation, as well 
as revisions to the postcard that 
highlights the basics of response 
protocol.

Amir 
Baghdadchi, 

communications director for the 
University Housing Administration, 
said residence hall student staff 
receive training on how to respond 
to an active shooter situation 
through the DPSS Building Incident 
Response Team. The training also 
teaches residential staff how to 
respond to a variety of emergency 
situations. BIRT also offers a 
refresher course in emergency 
situation response, which is offered 
in the winter term.

“BIRT training discusses safety 

(and) security for the staff and 
residents 
using 
best 
practices 

from emergency first response 
disciplines,” Baghdadchi said. “All 
training is conducted by DPSS 
officers and DPSS Community 
Liaisons.”

Staff 
units 
make 
up 
a 

majority 
of 
the 
presentation 

requests, 
but 
presentations 

are also popular among large 
student 
organizations. 
Safety 

presentations 
are 
currently 

optional and by request only, 
but DPSS Chief of Police Robert 
Neumann encourages all students, 
faculty and staff to be informed, 
either by viewing the website and 
video information or attending an 
in-person presentation.

“Immediate, decisive action 

on the part of those facing such a 
situation saves lives, and excellent 
training is easily accessible,” 
Neumann said.

Neumann also warns students 

to remain vigilant and prepared 
for any possibility, either on- or 
off-campus.

“It is an unfortunate reality that 

we as individuals and a community 
need to think of preparation for 
active violence events in much 
the way we do for fires and severe 
weather,” Neumann said. “While 
the chances of one facing such a 
situation are very remote, they 
can occur at any time, in any 
place, with little or no warning.

A

sk anyone who has ever 
stepped foot into a high 
school, and they’ll tell 

you that high school 
is nothing like the 
way it’s portrayed 
in movies. People 
don’t jump on to 
lunch 
tables 
and 

break into perfectly 
choreographed 
musical 
numbers, 

nor are the walls 
adorned with larger-
than-life 
murals 

of the school’s star 
basketball 
players. 

(OK, so maybe I’m pulling from 
one movie in particular, but 
you get the gist). Hollywood’s 
portrayal of college, however, 
isn’t far off.

Walk 
into 
any 
college 

fraternity party, and all the 
movie tropes are there: beer 
pong, 
the 
all-mysterious 

“jungle 
juice,” 
speakers 

blasting the top 40 hits and a 
packed dance floor occupied 
by many, many couples locked 
at the lips in the throes of 
passion. At my first college 
party, it didn’t take long for 
me to realize that not many of 
those “couples” were actually 
in 
committed 
relationships; 

rather, they were just engaging 
in a party activity so popular 
that there’s even an Instagram 
page dedicated to it: making 
out with strangers. 

Coming 
from 
a 
rather 

conservative upbringing, the 
whole party atmosphere was 
a culture shock for me, but the 
discovery that hookup culture 
is alive and real shocked me 
most of all. You see, I’m a 
romantic at heart, and what I 
was seeing around me seemed 
to defy my very definitions of 
love and relationships. As I 
watched my friends so easily 
accept and join this culture, I 
felt stuck and alone, isolated 
in this fast and casual world 
by my notions of romance and 
having one true love. What’s 

wrong with me? I thought as 
the girls around me gossiped 
about all the boys they’d kissed 

the 
night 
before. 

Am I the only one 
not enjoying this? 
I’d wonder as I yet 
again 
squirmed 

away from a boy 
who got too close at 
a party.

For a long time, 

I grappled with the 
feeling that perhaps 
I was behind the 
times. Perhaps I was 
too prudish for this 

new society, which had fully 
embraced its own sexuality and 
freedom. Or maybe proponents of 
hookup culture knew something 
I didn’t: Maybe they knew that 
Mr. Right would not come along 
and sweep me off my feet, no 
matter how long I waited, and I 
might as well have some fun.

“Hookup 
culture 
makes 

me so sad. Is romance dead?” 
I texted a friend once, in 
melodramatic despair. “Is love 
just a farce?” My tender heart 
was breaking at the thought. 
She messaged back promptly, 
with a question I had never 
once considered: “Why do they 
have to be mutually exclusive?”

It was such an obvious 

question, yet never one that 
had even crossed my mind, as 
I’d just automatically decided 
in my mind that love and 
hookup culture were polar 
opposites: neither could live 
while the other survived. 

Dr. 
Zhana 
Vrangalova, 

renowned sex researcher who 
delivered the TEDx talk “Is 
Casual Sex Bad For You,” would 
beg to differ. In an interview 
with Vogue’s Karley Sciortino, 
Vrangalova stated: “Sex and 
love are two separate needs, and 
humans have both of them … 
Just because you have sex with 
a lot of people doesn’t mean 
that you don’t need love and 
relationships — people will want 
that no matter what. However, 
people may decide to postpone 
love and relationships in order to 
have more sex, because we live 
in a culture that doesn’t leave 
room for open relationships for 
the most part. But there is no 
research suggesting that having 
a lot of casual sex will somehow 
impede your ability to have 
relationships or form intimacy 
in the future.” 

Our generation is known 

to engage in more premarital 
sex with more partners while 
holding off on marriage for 
longer than generations past, 
but that doesn’t mean the 
sanctity of marriage is suffering 
for it. Rather, marriages that 
begin later in a couple’s life 
have a lower chance of divorce 
than those that begin in a 
couple’s early 20s. That means 
that marriages today might 
even last longer than those 
of our parents’ generation. In 
short, hookup culture in college 
does not infringe on love and 
romance in our futures.

To my fellow romantics 

out there: fear not. Hookup 
culture does not mean the 
death of our hopes and dreams. 
It can be difficult to classify 
this culture as “good” or “bad,” 
and I have concluded that it is 
neither — instead, it is merely 
a byproduct of social progress, 
and we are free to follow it or 
leave it; neither path is more 
righteous than the other.

L

ast Saturday, I joined 
more than 8,000 people 
in front of the Michigan 

Capitol for the Women’s March 
on Lansing. Over these past 
few days I have tried to qualify 
what I felt and experienced 
in words, but honestly, all my 
attempts so far have seemed 
cheap. And while it was the 
Women’s March, I feel it’s 
important to explain why I, as 
a man, chose to participate.

I marched for my immigrant 

father who is most at risk if 
President 
Trump’s 
Muslim 

Registry becomes reality. I 
marched for my mother and 
sister whose hijabs mark them 
as targets for the hateful, 
xenophobic factions of our 
country. I marched for my little 
brother who should know there 
is nobility when men stand for 
women’s rights.

My family was not with me 

in Lansing, but I saw many 
other families. Parents brought 
their children, even infants 
in strollers, to this historic 
moment. An elderly couple came 
to what I learned was their 
first protest. A girl a few years 
younger than myself ran around 
wrapped in a rainbow pride flag, 
a giant smile on her face.

I marched because Planned 

Parenthood gave my mom her 
first job as a nurse. I marched 
because without Medicare, my 
grandfather would have likely 
been uninsured because of his 
Parkinson’s disease. I marched 
because, as an aspiring public 
health practitioner, I know 
that closing clinics and gutting 
the former President Barack 
Obama’s health care law are 
terrible ideas.

One of the speakers at the 

march, a Central Michigan 
University student, told the 
crowd 
about 
her 
Planned 

Parenthood experience. She 
recounted how the “pro-life” 
protesters outside the clinic 
made her feel. She said that the 
first thing the staff at Planned 
Parenthood did was make sure 
she was healthy. She told us not 
once did she feel pressured into 
getting an abortion.

I marched because, though 

I was born in the heartland 
of this country, I am still seen 
as an outsider. I marched in 
solidarity 
with 
Black 
and 

Latin Americans because I, 
too, have been profiled by law 
enforcement because of my 
identity. I marched because 
“law and order” should not be 
code for marginalization.

I 
marched 
because 
my 

transgender friends need less 
to worry about, not more. I 
marched because my lesbian, 
gay and bisexual friends have 
told me that the struggle for 
their equality did not end in 
June 2015. I marched because 
loving who you love and freely 
engaging with the world as your 
true gender are human rights.

People of every ethnicity, 

gender, age and ability shared 
space on the wet grass that 
afternoon. Many people waved 
signs with Shepard Fairey’s 
images of a Muslim woman in 
a star-spangled hijab, a Black 
woman with cornrows and a 
Latina woman with a flower 
in her hair. The organizers had 
reserved seats at the front of 
the gathering for those with 
mobility issues. An Indian man 
graciously offered to take a 
picture of me on my phone.

I marched for all men who, 

during Obama’s and former 
Vice 
President 
Joe 
Biden’s 

administration, had role models 
who told them to step up and 
be better. I marched because 
President Donald Trump is the 
bombastic embodiment of toxic 
masculinity.

Gubernatorial 
candidate 

Gretchen Whitmer said that the 
uncle who mistakenly voted for 
Trump is not the enemy; it is 
Trump himself. I agree. I have 
a friend, a Hispanic woman, 
who voted for Trump and I am 
not ashamed to say that I can 
sympathize with her reasons 
for doing so. We must buck 
our pride and rebuild burned 
bridges with the people in our 
lives who disagree with us. If 
nothing else, at least we will 
learn why they voted for a man 
so many have come to fear.

I also agree with Dr. Farha 

Abbasi, assistant professor of 
psychiatry at Michigan State 
University, who said in a thick 
Pakistani accent that she was 
the United States of America.

The unity on that day in 

Lansing and across the world 
— as millions came together in 
defense of what is right — was 
amazing. I just hope that this 
unity turns into an organized 
front against Trump and his 
Cabinet, and that all those 
marchers in swing states like 
Michigan will vote in 2018 and 
2020. The 10 Actions/100 Days 
campaign is promising but the 
motivation must be sustained.

Did it bother me that the 

march 
was 
women-centric 

and that there were signs 
proclaiming, “The future is 
female?” No. The Women’s 
March on Lansing was neither 
about me nor for me, but I still 
felt that my attendance was 
necessary and valuable.

I 
marched 
because 
as 
a 

privileged man, it is my duty to 
stand up for the rights of those 
threatened by sexism. I marched 
not to take over women’s spaces 
but to be an ally. I marched 
because I am trying to be the best 
feminist and ally that I can be.

One of my favorite memories 

was joining an impromptu march 
down a street and receiving a car 
horn salute from drivers stopped 
at an intersection. (A close 
second would be a papier-mâché 
Gov. Rick Snyder holding a cup 
of poisoned water.) The events 
worldwide on Jan. 21 prove that 
the movement toward equity 
and social justice has broad 
support. Those who oppose this 
movement should take note: you 
cannot silence us.

While I still cannot do my 

experiences and emotions at 
the Women’s March on Lansing 
justice in written form, a few 
words seem appropriate. The 
march was inspiration. It was 
hope. It was defiance. It was peace. 
It was inclusivity. It was diversity. 
It was unity.

There are no alternative facts

MICHAEL SUGERMAN | COLUMN

W

hen asked why Sean 
Spicer, 
the 
newly-

christened 
White 

House Press Secretary, 
outright 
lied 
about 

the size of the crowd 
at President Donald 
Trump’s inauguration, 
Kellyanne 
Conway, 

Counselor 
to 
the 

President, provided a … 
different perspective.

“You’re saying it’s a 

falsehood,” she said to 
NBC’s Chuck Todd on 
“Meet the Press.” “And 
they’re giving … alternative facts.”

Alternative 
facts. 
I 
was 

incredulous, and apparently the 
internet was, too. The clip and 
the new term went viral, as the 
gaffes of prominent political 
figures often do.

What is a “fact?” A quick 

Google search will tell you it’s 
“a thing that is indisputably the 
case.” Merriam-Webster defines 
it as “a piece of information 
presented as having objective 
reality.” With facts, there isn’t 
wiggle room.

With 
the 
perception 
of 

facts, on the other hand, there 
may be nuance. My friend and 
fellow Daily columnist Roland 
Davidson put it well a year 
ago in relation to competing 
understandings of capitalism: 
“Each individual’s definition 
comes from their own political 
location.”

Rest 
assured, 
I’m 
not 

going to rationalize Conway 
rationalizing 
Spicer 

rationalizing indisputably false 
crowd 
statistics. 
However, 

I’d like to share some related 
learnings from courses that 
have seriously forced me to 
question my approach to facts 
in a way that I think may be 
more valuable.

The first class centered on how 

governments can create policies 
that 
focus 
on 
apologizing, 

reconciling and administering 
reparations 
to 
historically 

subjugated and discriminated-
against groups. One of my 
primary takeaways was that 

“truth” 
is 
rarely 

universal, and what 
becomes 
historical 

record may leave out 
the perspectives of 
the marginalized.

People 
live 
and 

experience different 
truths, and our mass 
understanding 
of 

those truths is often 
passed 
through 
a 

gauntlet that filters 

out specific identities on the 
basis of a power structure. 
One paragraph from a recent 
reading in a class on social 
justice 
development 
explains 

this nicely. In “Decolonizing 
Methodologies: Research and 
Indigenous 
Peoples,” 
Linda 

Tuhiwai 
Smith 
explains, 

“Writing or literacy, in a very 
traditional sense of the word, 
has been used to determine the 
breaks between the past and the 
present, the beginning of history 
and the development of theory.” 
She later elaborates that these 
limitations, among others, have 
often restricted the proliferation 
of indigenous groups’ narratives 
in previously colonized areas of 
the world.

Concrete 
example: 
Was 

Columbus a discoverer or a 
murderer? 
Both? 
Which 
of 

these 
presentations 
is 
the 

“alternative” one? Maybe it’s 
a question of who’s telling the 
story, and clearly, it’s influenced 
by whether or not all the facts 
are present in the first place.

The combination of the two 

courses 
in 
particular 
adds 

to this train of thought. One 
focused on how media can 
influence 
political 
behavior 

and the other focused on how 
utilizing concepts of behavioral 
psychology can change the 
policy implementation process.

Both 
included 
discussions 

about motivated reasoning, an 

umbrella theory that explains 
that we have competing goals — 
accuracy and group belonging 
— ruled by emotions, not 
rationality. 
It 
is 
widely 

accepted that people would 
much rather believe they’re 
right and find resources to 
confirm 
their 
beliefs 
(or 

dispute others’) than admit 
their views might be flawed.

Ultimately, then, “alternative 

facts” don’t exist. Period. But 
what we believe is dependent 
upon myriad factors: our own 
identities, where we grow up, 
what we’re taught, who teaches 
us, the materials with which 
we’re taught and what those 
materials either include or 
don’t include.

Historical 
erasure 
and 

suppression exist. Motivated 
reasoning exists. The reality 
that we are not all exposed to 
others’ perspectives on a daily 
basis exists. Fact (hold the 
alternative): there is a great 
deal of information dispersed 
without nuance or the full 
representation 
of 
all 
those 

affected by its delivery.

The University of Michigan 

has been incredibly formative 
for me in this regard. I’ve 
learned how easy it can be to 
disregard specific groups and 
the subsequent actions some 
take to rationalize the status 
quo when a changing reality 
spawns discomfort. I’ve also 
come to realize how necessary 
it is to challenge the status quo 
instead of succumb to it.

In 
regard 
to 
Trump’s 

inauguration, photo evidence is 
as empirical as it gets. The end 
game: Moving forward, it will 
be of collective importance to 
talk about eliminating barriers 
to 
unheard 
narratives, 
not 

bicker about crowd sizes. I 
hope our federal government 
will do the same.

University 
of 
Michigan 

English professor Keith Taylor 
will 
be 
reading 

his most recent 
poetry collection 
“The Bird-While” 
at Literati Friday 
evening.

The title and 

theme 
of 
his 

new collection is 
inspired by a quote 
from one of Ralph 
Waldo Emerson’s 
journals: “A Bird-
while. In a natural 
chronometer, 
a 
Bird-while 

may be admitted as one of the 
metres, since the space most of 
the wild birds will allow you 
to make your observations on 
them when they alight near you 
in the woods, is a pretty equal 
and familiar measure” (Ralph 
Waldo Emerson’s Journal, 1838).

Taylor said much of his work 

is based on nature, and is often 
compared 
to 
many 
Eastern 

meditative poets who focus on 
the natural world in their work. 
“The Bird-While” is a collection 
of 49 poems which focus on the 
nature world that surrounds us 
in our daily lives. He hopes that 
many of the poems come across 
as 
intense 
and 
meaningful, 

as he’s devoted nine years to 

creating this collection.

In regards to both his writing 

career and his personal life, 
Taylor, a renowned poet and 
essayist, said he always chooses 
to “follow the love.”

Taylor 
is 
a 
Canadian 

immigrant 
who 
came 
to 

midwestern 
America 
in 
the 

1960s at age 11. 
Having 
endured 

a 
childhood 
in 

which 
he 
was 

made fun of and 
pushed aside for 
being different, he 
knew he wanted 
to be a writer 
when 
writing 

became an outlet 
to prove himself.

Taylor’s journey through the 

arts has been diverse and unique. 
He grew up in a conservative 
and religious household, had 
a 
challenging 
move 
across 

countries and found art at a very 
young age. At 17, he wanted to 
be a bookseller in Europe, so he 
spent part of his life a traveling 
there and across the United 
States with little to no money 
before choosing to follow the 
woman he was in love with to 
Ann Arbor, Michigan. The two 
still live in Ann Arbor and have 
a 25-year-old daughter. 

After selling books for eight 

years at the original Border’s 
bookstore on State Street and 
one other smaller bookstore, and 
getting a fellowship in poetry 

from the National Endowment 
for the Arts, Taylor claims his 
work 
became 
“legitimized.” 

Soon after, Taylor was offered 
a position as a professor at the 
University of Michigan.

“The measure of a culture has 

always been in its arts,” Taylor 
said. He is an advocate for a 
strong sense of unity between 
artists, 
especially 
for 
the 

future. Taylor urges all young 
artists to never stop writing, 
even when it may seem easy to 
give up in such struggling times 
in our communities and our 
country.

Taylor’s poems, stories, book 

reviews, essays and articles 
have appeared in magazines and 
newspapers around the country. 
His poetry collections have been 
published into multiple books, 
and he is a well known author in 
the Ann Arbor community and 
beyond.

One of the most interesting 

things about speaking with 
Keith Taylor is his unique sense 
of passion. When confronted 
with adversity in his life, his 
resilience to continue his work 
in writing allowed his career 
to flourish. He had mentioned 
that people did not recognize 
his work until after he turned 
50, but that never stopped 
him from creating art before 
that. His sense of pride, keen 
intelligence, love for the arts 
and drive for creative writing 
can be considered a story of 
perseverance and fervor.

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW

Fans 
and 
detractors 
of 

Christian movies alike know 
exactly what to expect from 
“The Resurrection of Gavin 
Stone.” All one needs to do is 
watch 30 seconds of the trailer 
to feel as if they have a grasp 
on what beats the story will 
follow and what the film has 
to offer as a whole. A film with 
a talented director or writer 
would throw in a twist along 
the way to keep things fresh, 
but Dallas Jenkins (“What 
If…”) 
is 
apparently 
much 

more interested in telling the 
same story that’s been told a 
hundred times before without 
adding anything new to the 
mix. The result is what may be 
the most painfully, annoyingly 
predictable film to have a wide 
release in quite some time.

“The Resurrection of Gavin 

Stone” begins with a massive 
exposition dump designed as 
a newscast that apparently 
dedicates a portion of its show 
every day to a segment about 
washed-up 
child 
stars. 
By 

the end of the segment, most 
viewers should be able to plot 
out the beats of the character 
arc of the titular “resurrectee” 
down to the minute. Again, 
there aren’t any twists. There’s 
nothing that may cause anyone 
to think twice. The film is in the 
business of taking the easy way 
out wherever it can, whether in 

humor, in character, or in story.

From 
there 
comes 
the 

introduction of Gavin Stone 
(Brett 
Dalton, 
“Marvel’s 

Agents 
of 
S.H.I.E.L.D.”). 

Dalton 
showed 
himself 
on 

“Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.” to be 
a 
capable 
actor, 

as his character 
started out as what 
“MST3K” 
would 

have once deemed 
a “big, brave brick 
of meat” to the 
most 
deliciously 

evil villain on the 
show. In “Gavin 
Stone,” 
he 
is 

inarguably the best 
part, as he actually 
makes the more 
dramatic scenes of the film 
work to a certain extent, even 
as he stumbles over the clunky 
dialogue in the quieter scenes.

He is not alone in this 

respect 
— 
actors 
struggle 

with their parts. Again, much 
of this can be chalked up to 
the unnatural dialogue, but it 
feels as if there was a lack of 
direction, as well. Neil Flynn 
(“The Middle”), known to many 
as a talented comedian whose 
improvisational approach to 
comedy helped shape NBC 
comedy “Scrubs,” gets mired 
in the humorless role of Gavin’s 
father, which affords him no 
opportunities for laughs.

On 
that 
note, 
“The 

Resurrection of Gavin Stone” 
is officially classified as a 
dramedy, and considering how 
often the film pauses after 

“laugh lines,” apparently to give 
its audience time to catch their 
breath, it stands to reason that 
at some point, something funny 
should actually happen. Yet 
over the ninety-two minutes of 
its runtime, not one joke works. 

The writers go 
for the easy joke 
10 
times 
out 

of 10, and as a 
consequence, 
every 
attempt 

at humor falls 
flat. There are 
moments 
at 

which it appears 
to 
be 
trying 

to satirize the 
different 
types 

of people found 

in an average church, but 
considering even the leads are 
never developed beyond those 
generic stereotypes, the jokes 
ultimately feel hypocritical.

Even the generic humor 

pales in comparison to the 
utter banality of the main 
story, though. It’s clear from 
the trailers and it’s clear from 
the opening moments of the 
movie, it’s the “liar revealed” 
plot. It recurs like the plague; 
all that’s necessary is to put 
the main character’s name in 
the all-encompassing mad lib. 
There’s no thought put into 
“The Resurrection of Gavin 
Stone” 
beyond 
this 
initial 

paint-by-numbers 
premise, 

and the movie is consequently 
unrecommendable. It’s been 
done before and done better in 
every way.

It is rare to see dramatic 

television 
produced 
in 
a 

20-minute 
format 
and 
be 

successful — take “Downton 
Abbey,” 
“Sherlock” 
and “Game of 
Thrones” 
as 

strong examples 
of 
dramas 

whose air time 
is significantly 
lengthened past 
the 
standard 

40 
minute 

slot — yet, as 
Laurel Ulrich once said, “Well-
behaved women seldom make 
history.”

“Z: 
The 
Beginning 
of 

Everything” is an Amazon-
produced series that follows the 
relationship between Southern 
belle Zelda Sayre (Christina 
Ricci, 
“The 
Lizzie 
Borden 

Chronicles”) and author F. 
Scott Fitzgerald (David Hoflin, 
“Once Upon a Time”). To say 
that their relationship was a 
tumultuous one would be the 
understatement of the century. 
A 
marriage 
riddled 
with 

alcoholism 
and 
accusations 

of infidelity, the Fitzgeralds 
were a revolutionary couple 
in 
a 
time 
when 
flappers 

and liquor began to push 
conservative 
boundaries. 
A 

rebellious couple rivaled only 
by Bonnie and Clyde, Zelda and 
her husband lived a carefree 
lifestyle, accentuated by the 
social scene and high-class 
pampering that accompanies 
fame. Though Zelda Fitzgerald 
might be permanently branded 

into history textbooks for her 
struggles with mental illness 
and her relationship with F. 
Scott, the first episode of “Z” 
shows us a side of Zelda rarely 
seen — a girl who craved the 
spotlight and is a force to be 
reckoned with.

As the opening 

sequence of “Z” 
comes across the 
screen, it’s easy to 
see why Christina 
Ricci was chosen 
to 
portray 
the 

infamous novelist. 
What 
Ricci 

lacks in physical 
description, 
she 
makes 
up 

in bravado in a daring and 
enchanting 
manner. 
Rule-

breaker and cigarette smoker, 
the 
show’s 

writers, 
at 

times, exhaust 
themselves 
in 
reminding 

viewers 
of 

Zelda’s Flapper-
esque lifestyle. 
Ricci presents a 
younger Zelda, 
who 
makes 

up 
what 
she 

lacks in proper 
social 
cues 

with 
a 
fierce 

and 
burning 

intelligence. 
Though 
the 

series 
is 

considerably and noticeably 
cliched, it paints an interesting 
portrait 
of 
a 
young, 
yet 

troubled, Zelda. And for any 
fan of “The Great Gatsby,” it’s 
not hard to miss the parallels 
drawn 
between 
Zelda 
and 

Scott’s relationship to that 

of Jay and Daisy. These only 
serve to further drive home the 
fact that the show’s intended 
audience is likely the modern 
bibliophile. If it’s not irony 
then I’m not sure what is.

Cliché 
throwaway 
lines 

and 
stereotypes 
aside, 
it’s 

hard not to take note of the 
grandeur of “Z,” which makes 
use of the dazzling sets and 
sparkling 
costumes 
of 
the 

roaring twenties. As promised, 
the series aims to take us from 
the grassroots beginnings of 
Zelda’s upbringing in the South 
to the streets of New York City, 
chronicling her passion with F. 
Scott as the series progresses. 
The scene changes are a clever 
way to approach the timeline 
and 
progression 
of 
fame 

between the two. While Zelda 

may write softly 
in 
her 
journal 

back 
home 
in 

Montgomery, I’m 
certain that the 
New York City 
scene will bring 
her 
towards 
a 

ferocious writing 
style 
as 
she 

delves 
further 

into the myth and 
less so into the 
person 
herself. 

That being said, 
the 
series 
has 

showed a serious 
struggle 
with 

depth, as many 

of the problems that arise 
feel like repetitive, tired-out 
tropes. However, so long as 
Ricci can continue portraying 
the young rebel in the same 
manner she has in the pilot, 
I’m certain that the series 
itself can rewrite history.

SINGLE REVIEW

 
As we enter the era 

of a Trump presidency, we 
must ask ourselves: How did 
we get here?
 
On the title track of 

his upcoming third record, 
“Pure Comedy,” Josh Tillman 
— the witty singer/songwrit-
er behind indie rock moniker 
Father John 
Misty — offers 
an answer.
 
In 

six-and-a-
half minutes 
of ingenious, 
blistering one-
liners, “Pure 
Comedy” is 
Tillman at his 
most intensely poetic and 
political, revealing human-
ity in all its naked absurdity, 
with scathingly witty lyrics 
and mournful horn-heavy 
instrumentation. So far, it’s 
the best post-Trump song of 
2017.
 
Tillman may be 

known as a satirist, but “Pure 
Comedy” is still not quite 
like his past work. Instead of 
incorporating his usual dry, 
ironic humor, Tillman infus-
es brutal honesty with bitter 
melancholy. Granted, it’s a bit 
preachy, but also somewhat 
inspired, especially coming 

from a smug goofball like 
Tillman. From beginning 
to end, Tillman jumps from 
vivid detail to vivid detail, 
describing the world in 
which we currently live with 
dystopian overtones. In the 
song’s fascinating, haphazard 
music video, Tillman evokes 

this nightmarish 
reality, juxta-
posing crudely 
drawn black-and-
white images 
with archival 
footage of every-
thing wrong with 
modern Ameri-
can culture.
 
He 

denounces the narcissistic 
toxicity of consumerism 
(“They worship themselves 
yet they’re totally obsessed”), 
the misguided groupthink 
of religion (“And how’s this 
for irony, their idea of being 
free is a prison of beliefs / 
That they never ever have to 
leave”) and the unexpected 
rise of Donald Trump as a 
political figure (“Where did 
they find these goons they 
elected to rule them?”). Clips 
of natural disasters and for-
est fires also make for some 
harrowing, apocalyptic 
images, which showcase the 

stakes that Tillman is posit-
ing for our bleak future.
 
Minute by minute, 

“Pure Comedy” exposes the 
darkness of our actions and 
their consequences, but by 
forcing us to confront these 
troubling realities, Tillman 
drives his point home: There 
are more flaws to fix than 
we might think. Mankind 
is constantly fighting the 
“struggle to survive,” as Till-
man remarks, and yet we 
find ourselves in a perpetual 
state of fear and confusion. 
The world is indeed messed 
up, and not without our own 
doing. It’s certainly not a 
pretty message, but with 
Tillman’s imaginative song-
writing and broad worldview, 
“Pure Comedy” makes a pro-
found statement about where 
we are now and where we 
might be headed.
 
So, are we actually 

doomed? According to Till-
man, we might be. But even 
for someone as cynical as 
he is, a cautious hope still 
remains on the horizon. In 
the end, Tillman comes full 
circle, leaving us with the 
chilling final line, “I hate to 
say it, but each other’s all we 
got.”

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Jason Momoa (“Game of 

Thrones”) 
has 
practically 

made his career off of being the 
most badass guy in the room. 
From “Stargate: Atlantis” to 
his 
star-making 

turn 
as 
Khal 

Drogo, 
Momoa 

now 
lends 
his 

dominating 
presence 
to 

the 
new 
series 

“Frontier.”

Set 
in 
the 

freezing 
cold 

and 
the 
wide 

wilderness 
of 
18th-century 
Canada, 

“Frontier” 
details 
the 
fur 

trade — one of the period’s 
most lucrative industries — in 
which, if the weather didn’t 
kill you, one of your many 
competitors likely would.

Few 
actors 
can 
capture 

the intensity Momoa conveys 
with a single look, and the 
show takes full advantage of 
this. Decked in furs, leather 
and more knives than you 
can count, Momoa cuts an 
intimidating figure as Declan 
Harp, 
a 
rogue 
fur 
trader 

looking to make his mark 
through any means he can. 
However, as striking as Momoa 
is, the series holds Declan at 
arm’s length early on, favoring 
the 
character’s 
imposing 

presence over dialogue and 
exposition. Outside of Momoa’s 
talents, 
the 
audience 
isn’t 

given much to latch onto his 
character, with the few details 
the writers drop feeling overly 
familiar and tired out.

Competing against Declan 

are several clashing parties, 
all trying to get the upper hand 
in the bloody business of fur 
trading. From the far-reaching 
Hudson Bay Company to the 
desperate 
Brown 
brothers, 

everyone is looking for an 

advantage 
in 
“Frontier,” 

the most prized being trade 
with the Lake Walker tribe. 
All of this is framed against 
a wilderness that can turn 
into a freezing whiteout at a 
moment’s notice. And while 
“Frontier” mostly does a fine 
job visually of capturing this 
expanse, less can be said for 

its 
struggling 

narrative.

“Frontier” 

frames the world 
of fur trading as 
one of intrigue 
and 
back-

stabbing — with 
maybe a little too 
much stabbing for 
its own good — as 
characters bloody 

their hands while moving from 
one underdeveloped plot to the 
next. The scheming by several 
characters, especially that of 
Declan’s former Hudson Bay 
employer and cold company-
man 
Lord 
Benton 
(Alun 

Armstrong, “Penny Dreadful”) 
and his ambitious subordinate 
Captain 
Chesterfield 
(Evan 

Jonigkeit, “X-Men: Days of 
Future Past”), feel rushed and 
truncated early in the series. 
Maybe it’s the fact that there 
are only six episodes in this 
inaugural season, but very 
few early plot points are given 
the time to properly grow and 
resonate despite their initial 
potential in the first two 
episodes.

These 
hurried 
storylines 

tend to undercut chances for 
major tension in the series, 
notably the first steps in the 
arc 
of 
audience 
surrogate 

Michael 
Smyth 
(Landon 

Liboiron, “Hemlock Grove”). 
Forced into working as a spy 
for Benton, Michael sets out to 
find Declan and become a part 
for his group. However, the 
chance for shifting alliances 
and intrigue quickly dissipates 
as Michael comes clean in the 
first episode. As far as plotting 
goes, “Frontier” often aims 

for expediency over drawn 
out tension as characters and 
alliances are introduced and 
cut off with the quick thrust 
of a knife while motivations 
are continuously murky. It 
might keep some viewers on 
their toes, but it also cuts off 
potential in its race to the 
finish line.

Compare 
“Frontier” 
to 

“Peaky 
Blinders,” 
another 

Netflix import with a similar 
amount of episodes per season, 
and some of these weaknesses 
become 
more 
apparent. 

“Blinders,” especially in its 
first two seasons, is a series 
that makes each episode feel 
like it’s contributing to a bigger 
game, that every subplot and 
narrative arc is methodically 
placing a piece together into 
a larger puzzle. Meanwhile, 
“Frontier” seems to drop and 

pick up random bits and pieces 
in an attempt to find something 
that fits into a larger picture. 
It’s not completely hopeless, 
and Momoa is always exciting 
to watch, but I’m unsure of 
the payoff that’s to come as 
the season moves along and 
whether it’ll be worth it all in 
the end.

Weak writing and underdeveloped plot bodes ill for new series

Despite strong presence, Jason 
Momoa not enough to save ‘Frontier’

I saw “Jackie” four times, and 

I’ll probably see it a fifth. I cry 
less each time, but I fear I’ll never 
stop being severely shaken by 
the cast of phenomenal jawlines. 
I think it’s a breathtaking biopic 
— a piece of history augmented 
by talented and stunning actors, 
a 
sublime 
soundtrack 
and 

exquisite costume choices by 
Madeline Fontaine.

Above all, “Jackie” gives 

life to the immortalized, albeit 
static, Kennedy mystique that 
today is only found in iconic 
photographs. A brief Google 
search gives you the album: JFK 
and bae beaming on a sailboat, 
cutting their wedding cake or 
flashing haunting smiles just 
before his assassination. 

Who lives like this? You 

wonder. Where does reality end 
and 
fantasy 
begin? 
Therein 

lies the Kennedy allure: the 
ever 
so 
Town-&-Country-

ready spectacle, the impossible 
fairytale of Camelot.

Director 
Pablo 
Larraín 

absorbed 
the 
glamour 
and 

refracted it with a realized edge. 
Though we watched Jackie’s 
curated pageantry in action, 
we also saw the broken woman 
behind the perfectly blown-out 
bob. She faced the facts in public, 
but blunted her memories in 
Stoli behind her walk-in closet 
doors. The learned vixen in a 
Dior suit crumbled by nightfall 
in layered chiffon negligees.

I resent the definition of a 

style icon as it exists today — or 
that a woman of such capability 
and caliber is reduced to the 
symbol of a pillbox hat. An 
accoutrement or outfit does not 
make an icon, the iconic woman 
gives life to any assemblage of 
fabric; I digress.

It was heartbreaking to watch 

a woman’s world turned upside 
down, yet empowering to watch 
her reconstruct a new narrative 
with what remained. Moreover, 
it was refreshing to see an 
aesthetically 
inclined 
figure 

take a realistic course of action 
after a devastating setback. For 
each time I expected Jackie 
to fall back on her demure 
pretense, 
I 
was 
pleasantly 

shaken 
by 
her 
outspoken 

character. Natalie Portman’s 
Jackie is as authentically Jackie 
as she could be — unpredictable, 
dynamic, bold and tenacious.

This 
separation 
between 

expectations and reality, or 
the gap among fact and fiction, 
permeates the film, and as I 
later 
realized, 
categorized 

Jackie’s entire life. There’s a line 
in the movie that beautifully 
encapsulates this notion: “I’ve 
grown accustomed to a great 
divide between what people 
believe and what I know to be 
real,” she tells the journalist in 
the film who’s trying to tell her 
story to the world.

The 
prescience 
of 
this 

sentiment is uncanny. We live 
in a world where the word of 
the year for 2016 was either 
post-truth or surreal, depending 
on which source you find most 
credible. We live in a country 
where the president doesn’t 
really 
care 
to 
acknowledge 

what credibility means. We’re 
starting to lose our own grip 
on 
deciphering 
what’s 
fact 

from what’s fiction (shout out, 
alternative facts).

The fashion industry has sat 

comfortably on the fulcrum 
of 
fantasy 
and 
reality 
for 

centuries. For every frivolous 
form favored over pragmatic 
function, there’s a structured 
suit eschewing all notions of the 
inessential. For every egregious 
request overheard at a fashion 
PR firm, there’s a grounded 
intern keeping a tally (see: 
myself). Though reconciling the 
pros and cons of these concepts 
in their sartorial definitions 
isn’t essential for society at 

large, it offers a pared-down, yet 
dressed up representation of our 
liminal society.

Last week’s Chanel couture 

show did everything couture 
is supposed to do. The small-
batch selection of charming 
confections 
inspired 
awe, 

and posited itself on the ever-
growing goals list of show-
going glitterati and average 
swine alike. Couture exists for 
couture’s sake, and it will always 
be accepted because no one 
really understands it. It’s the 
high art of fashion, crafted for 
the untouchable sect of society. 
It’s the most surreal slice of the 
industry.

And 
then 
there 
was 

Vetements, 
who 
took 
the 

roundabout, realistic approach 
to 
couture. 
Their 
runway 

showcased social types and 
their 
respective, 
expected 

garb — the society lady who 
lunches in her posh fur, the buff 
bouncer in leather, the polished 
SoHo gamine, the decidedly 
confused cowboy and every 
oddball archetype in between. 
Beyond their diverse characters, 
their racially varied runway is 
cause for celebration in itself. 
Vetements put the real in a place 
it doesn’t necessarily belong, 
and remarkably made it work. 
Couture may not be one-size-
fits-all, but it’s definitely open 
for aspiration to all. Deconstruct 
the fantasy, imbue it with reality 
and watch life imitate art.

From 
the 
Kennedys 
to 

couture, mythology surrounds 
the inaccessible. But that’s not 
to say there isn’t ample legroom 
for a hefty dose of reality 
(looking at you, Vetements). 
Reality and fantasy are equally 
polarizing — dwell too deeply on 
a pipe dream and you’re a goner, 
but stare truth in the eyes and 
you’re hopeless.

Fashion, to many, represents 

an assortment of the impractical, 
and maybe that’s the magic of it 
— the stifling walls and borders 
of reality are replaced with 
tangible creative expressions. 
Rather than mimicking reality, 
fashion offers a better — perhaps 
more beautiful — version of it. 

Seeking fashion fantasy while 
finding reality in Larraín’s ‘Jackie’

 “Frontier” often 

aims for expediency 

over drawn out 

tension as characters 

and alliances are 
introduced and cut 
off with the quick 
thrust of a knife

Louro set to leave Michigan, 
sign with New York Red Bulls

After three years and 44 

starts between the posts for the 
Michigan men’s soccer team, 
junior goalkeeper Evan Louro 
has signed a contract with the 
New York Red Bulls of Major 
League Soccer.

The South River, N.J., native 

has forgone his fourth year of 
eligibility with the Wolverines 
and passed up opportunities 
to play for European clubs to 
return home and play for the 
Red Bulls. Prior to coming to 
Michigan, Louro spent time in 
the Red Bulls’ youth academy. 
That experience allowed New 
York to offer him a deal — on a 
Homegrown Player contract — 
without going through the MLS 
SuperDraft.

“When I initially came to 

Michigan, I knew that this was 
what I wanted to do,” Louro 
said. “And that whenever we 
both decided the time was right 
for me to go, (the coaching 
staff) would support me in that 
decision.”

But that same coaching staff 

will 
undoubtedly 
miss 
his 

presence in goals.

In his 46 appearances with 

the Wolverines, Louro sports 
the second-best goals-allowed-
per-game 
average 
of 
any 

goalkeeper in program history 
(1.16). This season he set a 
career-high in saves, with 68, 
including a career-high 11 saves 
against then-No.1 Maryland.

“I wanted to win a trophy and 

all that good stuff,” Louro said. 
“But honestly I just want to be 
the guy who made the program 
better and put the program on 
that next step.”

The 
departure 
leaves 

Michigan with an experience 
gap at keeper next season, as 
the roster is now devoid of a 
goalkeeper who has started 
a collegiate match. Andrew 
Verdi, who redshirted this year, 
will likely enter the season as 
the presumptive starter. Verdi, 
though untested, arrived in Ann 

Arbor during the last offseason 
as a highly coveted recruit, 
having spent time with the U-18 
US Men’s National Team and 
the Philadelphia Union youth 
academy for five seasons. 

The coaching 

staff and Louro 
came 
to 
a 

decision that he 
was ready to sign 
professionally 
around 
mid-

October. Louro 
and 
senior 

defender 
Lars 

Eckenrode 
— 
who 
was 

selected in the 
fourth round of 
the SuperDraft 
by Toronto FC 
— will likely become the third 
and fourth active Wolverines in 
MLS. 

As for the most lasting 

memories he’s made with the 
program, 
Louro 
glowingly 

recalls a 3-2 victory over Notre 
Dame his freshman year — 
“The fans stormed the field,” he 
says — and a win over Michigan 

State 
last 

season. 

But he says 

what 
will 
be 

most 
difficult 

to leave behind 
about Michigan 
has 
nothing 

to 
do 
with 

soccer, nor what 
happened 
on 

the field at U-M 
Soccer Stadium. 

“I 
made 

some 
of 
my 

best friends (at 

Michigan) that will be my best 
friends for the rest of my life,” 
Louro said. “Really that’s what 
I’ll miss the most.”

Michigan reaping benefits 
of its home-court advantage

In the classic movie “The 

Wizard of Oz,” Dorothy uttered 
her famous line: “There’s no place 
like home.”

And 
while 
the 
Michigan 

women’s basketball team is from a 
different place and time, it would 
certainly agree with Dorothy’s 
sentiment. 

With their 80-54 victory over 

Northwestern 
on 
Wednesday, 

the Wolverines (6-2 Big Ten, 17-5 
overall) are now a perfect 11-0 at 
home in the 2016-17 season and 
sport a 19-game winning streak 
at Crisler Center. Michigan has 
not lost a game in its own arena 
since a 93-81 defeat at the hands of 
Nebraska on Jan. 24, 2016.

“Our players were confident,” 

said Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico after the game. “They 
showed a level of maturity. They 

showed a level of leadership. Our 
seniors and juniors have really 
taken the younger kids under their 
wings.”

Though Michigan’s win over 

the Wildcats — who are currently 
ranked 
44th 

in 
the 
Ratings 

Percentage Index 
— was one of the 
more impressive 
ones 
the 

Wolverines have 
pulled 
off 
this 

year, it was not 
the only quality 
triumph they have 
nabbed at home. 

Michigan 

topped 
Minnesota 
on 

Jan. 15, Indiana 
on Jan. 10 and Ohio on Dec. 
13. Each of these wins have 
contributed to the Wolverines’ 
quest to earn their first NCAA 

Tournament berth in four years.

“We know we have a great 

opportunity in front of us,” said 
senior guard Siera Thompson. “It’s 
very exciting, but you don’t want 
to get too far ahead of yourself 

because then you 
start 
dropping 

games that you 
can win.”

Michigan’s 

success 
this 

season 
has 

paid 
dividends 

in 
attendance 

figures, too, as it 
is on pace for a 20 
percent increase 
over last season.

However, 

the 
Wolverines’ 

good 
fortunes 

at Crisler might leave them 
wondering 
what 
might 
have 

been, as they faced both No. 3 
Maryland and No. 15 Ohio State 
on the road. Michigan held leads 
in both contests, including late 
in the fourth quarter against the 
Terrapins, before ultimately losing 
96-87 to the Buckeyes and 93-80 to 
Maryland. 

While the Wolverines won’t 

have the opportunity to see if 
playing on their home court would 
have made a difference against 
either squad, they may at least 
earn the opportunity to upset one 
or both teams in Indianapolis — 
on a neutral court. Though Barnes 
Arico didn’t want to look that far 
ahead, she did admit that she pines 
for shots at redemption.

“I’m (thinking) one game at a 

time,” Barnes Arico said. “But we 
talked about it after we played 
Maryland and after we played 
Ohio State — how close we are. 
We’ve got to get better at some 
things, and we know the things 
we have to get better at. We have 
to take care of our next eight or 
nine games and then hopefully 
after that point, we’ll have the 
opportunity to match up with 
those guys on a neutral court.”

Until then, Michigan will strive 

to extend its home winning streak 
and further prove that there really 
is no place like home.

Kevin Lohan reflects on multi-sport high school career

Kevin 
Lohan 
knows 
the 

benefits of playing multiple 
sports in high school. The 
senior defenseman played four 
years of high school hockey and 
lacrosse in Cold Spring Harbor, 
N.Y.

Now in his final season with 

the Michigan hockey team, 
Lohan knows the advantages 
that he earned from playing 
multiple sports.

“I grew up playing a bunch 

of 
sports,” 
Lohan 
said 
on 

Wednesday. “And then as you 
get older, it dwindles down and 
it eventually dwindles down to 
one sport. I think it’s great to 
have that little break from one 
sport. It kinda keeps it fresh, 
keeps your energy high, keeps 
that enthusiasm.

“I love both sports. I love 

hockey more, obviously, but, 
you know, the people you meet, 
the friendships and the things 
you learn go a long way in both 
sports. I definitely don’t regret 
playing lacrosse for as long as I 
did.”

Michigan 
coach 
Red 

Berenson often seeks out multi-
sport athletes to play under 
him. Students who play soccer 
and 
lacrosse 

often succeed in 
hockey as well 
because of their 
sports’ 
speed 

and 
constant 

back-and-forth 
play.

Though 

Berenson never 
played lacrosse, 
he has seen a 
handful of games 
and understands 
why Lohan had 
the talent to have played the 
sport competitively in high 
school.

“A lot of the hands (skills) are 

similar, hand eye coordination,” 
Berenson said. “It’s a contact 
sport with a lot of running, 
conditioning, moving.”

Added Lohan: 

“I think the two 
sports are fairly 
similar in terms 
of 
competitive 

nature 
and 

the 
offense 

and 
defensive 

aspects of the 
game. 
There’s 

a lot of similar 
stuff in terms of 
movement both 
in the defensive 
zone 
and 

offensive zone, that can help.”

While 
some 
young 
high 

school 
athletes 
choose 
to 

specialize in one sport by the 

time they reach high school, 
Lohan continued playing both. 
He explained that it wasn’t 
until his sophomore year that 
he began to place 
more 
emphasis 

on hockey Still, 
he 
continued 

to 
play 
both 

sports 
for 
his 

remaining 
two 

years.

It didn’t cross 

his mind until 
junior 
year, 

however, 
that 

he 
believed 

he 
possessed 

the 
skills 

and potential for a college 
hockey career. Even after this 
realization 
though, 
playing 

the sport after high school 

presented a challenge for Lohan.

“After that year, I decided to 

pursue hockey,” Lohan said. “I 
had some opportunities with 

lacrosse, 
but 

nothing 
with 

hockey, but that’s 
kinda where my 
passion was. I’d 
played 
hockey, 

and 
after 
the 

season I’d take 
a 
little 
break 

and 
my 
break 

would be playing 
the rest of the 
lacrosse season. 
Once that was 
over, I’d put my 

attention toward training for 
hockey.”

Perhaps 
Berenson 
might 

have embraced Lohan playing 

lacrosse in addition to lining 
up on defense. Besides Lohan, 
senior forward Max Shuart 
played two seasons of lacrosse 
and 
junior 

forward 
Cutler 

Martin 
played 

varsity tennis. 

“Sports 

nowadays 
have 

become 
so 

specialized,” 
Berenson 
said. 

“You 
have 
to 

become a one-
sport athlete at a 
young age. I like 
the fact that you 
can play more 
than one sport, that you be an 
athlete as well as a good hockey 
player. We’ve had some players 
who were very athletic and were 

really good hockey players. and 
we’ve had other players who 
only played one sport and were 
also good hockey players.

“But personally, I like to see 

kids that are well-rounded and 
playing other sports too.”

As Lohan progressed through 

the early parts of his career, he 
began to fully comprehend the 
skills that lacrosse taught him.

Lohan hasn’t entirely let 

go of playing lacrosse, either. 
The friendship between the 
hockey and the lacrosse team 
gives them opportunities to 
practice their skills during the 
offseason.

“We’re really close with those 

guys,” Lohan said. “There has 
been a couple times throughout 
the year, that, after our season 
was done, they had (opened) 
Oosterbaan. So a couple of the 
guys, we went in with them, and 
last year I went with (former 
Michigan forward) JT Compher, 
and 
(Wolverine 
midfielder) 

Mikie Schlosser on the lacrosse 
team took us in there and we 
messed around a little bit. It was 
definitely fun.”

Though Lohan focuses full-

time on manning Michigan’s 
blue line and clearing pucks out 
of the Wolverines’ zone, he still 
ponders whether he could’ve 

played 
lacrosse 

during hockey’s 
offseason in Ann 
Arbor.

“It was always 

in the back of 
my 
mind, 
the 

possibility 
of 

playing both in 
college,” Lohan 
said. 
“I 
had 

known 
some 

people 
who 

had done that. 
Realistically, 

that would’ve been my main 
goal, but things happen for a 
reason, and my heart was with 
hockey.”

Senior defenseman Kevin Lohan considered playing both lacrosse and hockey at Michigan after seeing the complementary nature of the two sports’ skillsets.

Consistency the question 
‘M’ now needs to answer

On 
Michigan’s 
opening 

possession of the second half, 
Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman 
had a bit of a mental lapse.

After 
sophomore 
forward 

Moritz Wagner passed the ball 
out to the junior guard, Abdur-
Rahkman took a couple steps 
back, thinking the shot Wagner 
just rebounded hit the rim and 
the Wolverines were working 
with a fresh shot clock. 

Instead, 
Abdur-Rahkman 

stood 30-plus feet away from the 
basket with under five seconds 
to shoot and both the bench and 
Maize Rage behind him urging 
him to pull the trigger.

So he did. And not one person 

in Crisler Center was surprised 
when 
his 
NBA-range 
three-

pointer found nothing but twine.

That was the kind of night 

Michigan 
was 
having. 
The 

Wolverines shot 63 percent from 
the field, outrebounded Indiana 
23-20 and committed just six 
turnovers.

They could do no wrong.
Those 
numbers 
strongly 

suggest 
that 
Michigan 
has 

returned to the team we saw 
in New York — the team that 
left Madison Square Garden 
considered not only an NCAA 
Tournament lock, but had ESPN 
commentators trying to convince 
the audience they were watching 
a top-10 team.

But don’t start taking guesses 

at where the Wolverines will be 
playing in the first round of the 
NCAA Tournament just yet.

Right after returning from 

New York as the 2K Classic 
champions, Michigan hit the road 
again. In their very next game at 
South Carolina, the Wolverines 
looked like a different team. 
Senior guard Zak Irvin lost his 
handle on the ball — committing 
eight turnovers — and the pair of 
Wagner and redshirt sophomore 
forward DJ Wilson vanished 
after breaking out on the big stage 
at the Garden.

Fast forward to Thursday 

night, and Michigan once again 
put together two performances 
in a row that make it look worthy 
of a top-25 ranking. Its defense 
prevented two of the Big Ten’s 
top offenses from scoring over 
60 points, and its offense was as 
precise and efficient as it has ever 
been.

“We just wanted to continue 

to play with the same energy and 
the momentum that we carried 
over from Illinois,” Irvin said. “I 
think we’re playing consistent 
right now as a team. I think we 
did that for a full 40 minutes. 
If we do that, we’re gonna be a 
dangerous team.”

Just a couple weeks ago, many 

posed questions ranging from 
the Wolverines’ lack of grit and 
fortitude to Michigan coach John 
Beilein’s job security.

Now, two wins later, the 

question everyone will be asking 
is how can this team keep doing 
what has been working well.

Thursday 
night 
was 
the 

first time each one of Beilein’s 
“starting seven” showed up and 
did their respective jobs for an 
entire game.

That 
ranged 
from 
Abdur-

Rahkman 
holding 
Indiana 

guard James Blackmon to four 
points; 
Wagner 
controlling 

his post matchup with center 
Thomas 
Bryant; 
Irvin 
and 

senior guard Derrick Walton 
making consistent and positive 
contributions on each end of the 
floor; and even redshirt junior 
guard Duncan Robinson and 
senior forward Mark Donnal 
coming off the bench and hitting 
big shots to extend the lead.

When those seven players 

come together and connect the 
way they did for 40 minutes, this 
team shows it is capable of going 
toe-to-toe with anybody in the 
country.

But how can the Wolverines 

keep this going over a stretch of 
80 minutes? Or 120 minutes? Or 
two weeks from now?

What evidence has Michigan 

given us that suggests it won’t 

lay an egg when it travels to the 
Breslin Center on Sunday like it 
did against the Gamecocks?

Beilein and his players have 

suggested the team has grown, 
not only physically, but more 
importantly, mentally.

“Games aren’t won at halftime, 

and trophies aren’t given out with 
time still on the clock,” Walton 
said. “It’s all about finishing each 
play, having the same focus that 
got you there, increasing that to 
prevail you forward.”

Walton and Irvin realize they 

combine to form the engine 
that makes the Wolverines go. 
Irvin had arguably his worst 
individual game of the season in 
South Carolina after one of his 
best against Southern Methodist. 
The two varied performances 
demonstrate that Michigan relies 
on his consistency now more than 
ever.

And while Wagner and Wilson 

have grown tremendously since 
the start of the season, they’ve yet 
to show their respective skill in 
stretches of two or three games.

“There are going to be times 

when we look like a million 
bucks and times we’re not ready,” 
Beilein 
said. 
“Don’t 
forget, 

(Wilson) and (Wagner) are really 
evolving yet. They are really 
playing crunch time minutes for 
the first time. They are going to 
do things sometimes they have to 
learn from.”

Thursday showed what the 

Wolverines can be: A team that 
more than belongs in the NCAA 
Tournament, and a team that 
deserves a larger share of Big Ten 
and national attention.

“Personally, as a team that 

wants 
to 
win, 
we 
honestly 

believe that we can make a run 
in March,” Walton said. “Some 
things are gonna change, the 
ball’s not gonna go in like it did 
tonight every night. You can only 
control what you can control.”

Now the question becomes 

how long will this level of 
performance last?

We’ll find out Sunday in East 

Lansing.

Wolverines dominate Hoosiers

Do 
you 
remember 
the 

Michigan men’s basketball team 
from New York City? The one 
that entered Madison Square 
Garden and made it look like its 
home court?

And do you remember the 

Wolverines 
that 
traveled 
to 

Pauley Pavillion? The same ones 
who matched No. 8 UCLA shot 
for shot and – at least for a half 
– looked capable of outshooting 
the third-best scoring offense in 
the country?

Well, that Michigan team was 

back Thursday night, welcoming 
Indiana to Crisler Center only to 
send the Hoosiers home with a 
brutal 90-60 loss.

“I wouldn’t say I’m surprised,” 

said senior wing Zak Irvin. “I’ll 
see us do this in practice, and we 
show spurts of it at times in games 
as well. For us (to shoot) the ball 
that well, you know, I always see 
that happening. But for us to be 
able to sit down and check on the 
defensive end the way we did, 
that’s really something special.”

Something looked different 

about the Wolverines from the 
opening tip. Indiana (4-4 Big 
Ten, 14-7 overall) might have 
drawn first blood, as center 
Thomas Bryant got to the basket 
with ease, but after that, things 
got ugly for the Hoosiers.

Following 
Bryant’s 
basket, 

Michigan (4-4, 14-7) went to 
Moritz Wagner early and often, 
clearly trying to expose the void 
left in Indiana’s frontcourt by 
forward OG Anunoby’s season-
ending knee injury. Wagner 
scored the first six points of the 
game to spark an 18-2 run in just 
over five minutes.

And with the run came the 

lead, and with the lead the déjà 
vu.

Like the Wolverines’ trip to 

the Garden in November, their 
offensive performance made it 
look like the hoop was a little 
bigger than usual.

Michigan 
ended 
the 
half 

shooting 66.7 percent from the 
floor and 7-for-11 from three, 
leading to a 50-35 advantage. It 
was the first time the Wolverines 
hit the 50-point halftime mark 
since the UCLA matchup.

By the end of it all, Michigan 

had 
posted 
90 
points 
and 

outscored the Hoosiers 40-25 
in the second half. Senior guard 
Derrick Walton Jr. led the way 
with a game-high 21 points, but 
five other Wolverines scored in 
double digits.

More impressive than the 

incendiary offense, though, was 
the new energy Michigan seemed 
to find against the Hoosiers — the 
same energy that was there in 
New York City.

Take Wagner as only one 

example. With 14:05 left to play in 
the first half, the ball was deflected 
out of bounds and Wagner was 
clapping his hands together down 
the sideline with an intensity 
that this team has lacked for the 
majority of conference play. And 
that was when the ball went out in 
favor of Indiana.

That energy turned into an 

ability for Michigan to do the 
small, dirty things that it hasn’t 
done all season – sticking out its 
legs for deflections rather than 
letting a pass land safely in its 
target’s hands.

The enthusiasm transferred 

to the stands too. For the first 
time all year – as the Wolverines 
stretched their lead to as much 
as 19 in the first half and 30 in 
the second – Crisler Center was 
rocking, helping inject life into 
a team that had looked lifeless 
before its past two games.

“(It was) exciting to see a good 

crowd,” said Michigan coach 
John Beilein. “I think we’re 
running a record for 9 pm games, 
but it was still a good crowd. And 
to have our team play that way in 
front of them.

“I think we saw that a little 

bit at the beginning of the year, a 
long time ago — seems like years 
ago — in the SMU and Marquette 
games, which are turning out to 
be great wins now, where we get 
clicking offensively and it leads 
to better defense as well.”

Michigan’s defensive effort 

showed encouraging signs as 
well. While Indiana hurt itself at 
times, the Wolverines still scored 
25 points off 16 turnovers.

In the first half, the Wolverines 

essentially scored themselves out 
of a troubling defensive effort, 
as the Hoosiers shot 60 and 62.5 
percent from the field and from 
three, respectively. The second 
half, though, saw Indiana shoot 
54.5 percent from the field 
and 53.8 from three, all while 
sophomore guard Muhammad-
Ali Abdur Rahkman held Hoosier 
guard James Blackmon Jr. to just 
four points on 2-for-3 shooting 
after he had a 33-point outburst 
against Michigan State in the 
Indiana’s previous matchup.

As the game drew to a 

close, there were points where 
Michigan fans even had the 
audacity 
to 
chant, 
“Hoosier 

Daddy.” In those moments, it 
seemed they knew this was 
the most complete game of the 
Wolverines’ season. In those 
moments, it felt a lot like New 
York again.
