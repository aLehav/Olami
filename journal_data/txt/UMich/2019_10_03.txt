The Center of the City Task 
Force met at Larcom City Hall 
Wednesday afternoon to advance 
their public engagement plan. It 
was the fifth task force meeting 
for 
the 
10-person 
municipal 
committee, created after local 
voters approved Proposal A to 
designate the library lot between 
Fifth Avenue and Division Street 
for plans to become a park and civic 
center commons. 

Community 
member 
and 
Pioneer High School senior Miles 
Klapthor is not a member of the 
task force but led the meeting in 
place of committee chair Meghan 
Mussolf. He explained his interest 
in this project as an Ann Arbor 
native who wants to see the land 
put to good use. 
“I first got involved with the task 
force after reading about it in the 
newspaper. I thought it was pretty 
interesting, the idea of having public 
input for how lands going to be 
used around downtown and down 
the block,” Klapthor said. “A lot of 

the time people my age, students in 
high school and students in college 
too, don’t really have a whole lot of 
input in the planning process in a 
lot of cases. Considering so much 
of the use of the area is centered 
around both the University, and 
a lot of high school students that 
are there, it’d be important to have 
some ideas brought to the table by 
people like me.”
The committee discussed the 
most effective method to reach 
members 
of 
the 
community, 
weighing the general efficacy of 
universal mailing versus targeted 

mailing, keeping in mind cost, 
likelihood of engagement and other 
factors. 
Committee member Alan Haber 
was the most vocal supporter 
of universal mailing, claiming it 
reached every stakeholder in Ann 
Arbor, while others proposed 
decreasing the scope of mailing 
lists to encourage specific feedback. 
“I do not believe our primary 
mode of communication with the 
public should be social media,” 
Haber said.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

A panel titled “Unintended 
Consequences: Panel on the 
Impact 
of 
‘Opioid 
Crisis’ 
Messaging on Those with 
Chronic Pain” kicked off 
Disability Community Month 
Wednesday. 
Disability 
Community 
Month is sponsored by the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
Human 
Resources 
department, 
Michigan 
Medicine 
and 
University 
Health Service. Around 30 

people attended the event, 
held at Hatcher Gallery, and 
many of them were graduate 
students supporting Shanna 
Kattari, the event coordinator 
and assistant professor in the 
School of Social Work. 
Kattari 
was 
a 
panelist 
in the event, in addition to 
two other women, Emma 
Garrett and Clarissa Love. 
One additional panelist was 
unable to attend the event 
because she could not find a 
handicap accessible parking 
spot close to the Hatcher 
Graduate Library. Before the 

panelists shared their own 
stories, Kattari shared stories 
of people who could not 
attend the panel due to their 
own chronic pain.
Kattari shared one story 
about a Vietnam War veteran 
whose 
insurance 
stopped 
paying for the pain medication 
he had been taken for decades.
When his children stopped 
hearing from him, they went 
to visit him and were shocked 
by what they discovered. 
“He was a mess,” Kattari 
said. “Turns out, after decades 
of 
being 
on 
medication, 

his providers cut him off 
cold turkey... They told him 
to 
work 
on 
mindfulness 
exercises to handle it, but he 
was completely depressed. 
He never moved from his 
armchair, 
except 
maybe 
to use the bathroom, and 
slept in that chair all the 
time, 
depressed. 
He 
was 
embarrassed… because he was 
ashamed he couldn’t make 
due about the medication.” 

Sarah Jones doesn’t want to 
stop fighting.
“I’m fighting to keep my son 
alive,” Jones said. “It’s been 
a nightmare every day since 
we’ve been here.”
On Saturday, Sept. 21, her 
son, 14-year-old Bobby Reyes, 
went into cardiac arrest after 
suffering an asthma attack 
while she was driving him 
home in Monroe County. He 
was immediately transferred 
to 
C.S. 
Mott 
Children’s 
Hospital in Ann Arbor, where 
doctors declared him brain 
dead.
After conducting a series 
of tests, doctors announced 
to the family Reyes would 
not recover, and they would 
be taking him off of his life 
support 
Friday, 
Sept. 
27. 
In response, Reyes’ family 
contacted 
an 
attorney 
to 
issue a court order that would 
extend his time on life support. 
On 
Monday, 
Washtenaw 
County’s 22nd Circuit Court 
ordered Michigan Medicine to 
delay taking Reyes off of life 
support.

State budget 
includes small 
increase for 
universities

U-M to receive total allocation of 
$373 million across three campuses

Elizabeth 
Anderson, 
University 
of 
Michigan 
professor of philosophy and 
women’s studies, was named a 
MacArthur Fellow last week. 
Anderson is one of 26 “Genius 
Grant” winners whose work 
displays 
“extraordinary 
originality.”
In addition to Anderson, 
who is known for her work 
in political philosophy and 
social 
epistemology, 
this 
year’s MacArthur Fellowship 
class 
includes 
writers, 
artists and urban planners. 
The fellowship comes with 
a 
$625,000 
grant 
to 
be 
distributed over five years. 
The Foundation was created 
by 
insurance 
businessman 
John MacArthur in 1970. 
The award is commonly 
known as the “Genius Grant” 
— against the wishes of the 
MacArthur Foundation itself 
— though Anderson said, in 
an interview with The Daily, 
she does not consider herself 
a genius in her field. Anderson 
pointed to research showing 
women are less likely to go 
into fields where one must be 
considered a “genius” rather 
than a hard worker.

University 
of 
Michigan 
campuses will see a slight 
increase in funding under the 
state 
budget 
Gov. 
Gretchen 
Whitmer signed into law on 
Monday. 
The budget includes $322.8 
million for the University’s Ann 
Arbor campus, a 0.6 percent 
increase 
from 
the 
previous 
fiscal year, with $26.3 million 
allocated for U-M Dearborn and 
$23.9 million for U-M Flint, 1 
percent and 1.3 percent increases 
respectively. The funds contain 
a stipulation that tuition for 
in-state undergraduates does 
not increase by more than 4.4 
percent or $587, depending on 
which is the larger amount.
The budget is the result of a 
months-long standoff between 
Whitmer and Republicans in 
the state legislature over the 
governor’s signature campaign 
promise to fix Michigan’s worn 
down roads and infrastructure.
Whitmer signed the budget for 

fiscal year 2020 hours before the 
deadline to fund the government 
and avoid a shutdown. She issued 
147 line-item vetoes to slash $947 
million from the 16 budgets sent 
to her desk. The cuts included 
$38 million in higher education 
tuition grants for private colleges 
and universities in the state 
and $150,000 for a program 
that supports students who are 
pregnant or parenting children.
In a video posted to Twitter 
on Monday night, Whitmer 
explained why she made the 
cuts.
“I took my role as governor 
very seriously,” Whitmer said 
in the video. “I had to use the 
line-item veto to try to clean up 
budgets that were a complete 
mess, built on phony numbers, 
using funds in the wrong way, 
usurping executive power. 
These are important things 
that I had to eliminate from 
these budgets. I’m always going 
to put the safety and the health 
and the welfare of the people 
of the state of Michigan before 
anything else.”

Panelists discuss the impact of the opioid crisis for those who deal with chronic pain at the Hatcher Gallery Wednesday afternoon.

The 
Weiser 
Center 
for 
Emerging Democracies hosted a 
panel on Wednesday discussing 
the 
state 
of 
Brazil 
under 
President Jair Bolsonaro and 
reflecting on how his rule has 
impacted higher education in 
the country. 
About 45 students, faculty and 
community members attended 
the event, which consisted of 
presentations and a question-
and-answer 
session 
from 
three professors and historical 
professionals. Benjamin Lessing, 
assistant professor of political 
science at the University of 
Chicago, 
highlighted 
the 
politics of crime and violence 
in 
Brazil, 
while 
WCED 
Postdoctoral 
Fellow 
Marília 

Corrêa spoke on the history of 
Brazilian military dictatorship. 
Guilherme Casarões, lecturer 
in international relations at the 
Fundação Getúlio Vargas São 
Paulo Business School, focused 
on how Bolsonaro has reshaped 
Brazil’s national identity. 
Brazilians elected Bolsonaro, 
a 
far-right 
politician, 
as 
president in October 2018 after 
a controversial and polarizing 
political race. Since his election 
into 
office, 
Bolsonaro 
has 
angered many Brazilian citizens 
and people across the globe with 
his contentious policies. In a 
video address, he threatened 
jailing 
and 
banishing 
his 
political opponents, and in an 
executive order, he undermined 
the rights of indigenous people 
and the LGBTQ community.
Panelists 
discussed 
the 
controversies 
surrounding 

Bolsonaro 
with 
his 
administration’s 
attacks 
on the press, loosening of 
environmental protections and 
cuts to education spending.
Panelist Casarões described 
the corruption present in the 
Brazillian cabinet, especially 
due to Olavo de Carvalho, self-
described Brazilian philosopher, 
and his strong influence on 
Bolsonaro’s administration. 
“The most important feature 
of Bolsonaro’s narrative and 
Carvalho’s 
role 
in 
shaping 
Bolsonaro’s narrative is the fact 
that he was able to appoint a 
number of different people to 
Bolsonaro’s cabinet,” Casarões 
said. “So it called people’s 
attention when the government 
was being formed that Carvalho 
was able to appoint at least three 
ministers out of 24 ministers 
in Bolsonaro’s cabinet, even 
though Carvalho had no 
vote at all.”
Casarões 
described 
how one of the positions 
Carvalho appointed was 
the Minister of Education 
Abraham 
Weintraub. 
Three 
of 
Carvalho’s 
former 
students 
are 
also 
in 
Bolsonaro’s 
administration, 
filling crucial roles in 
international 
affairs 
and 
foreign 
relations. 
Bolsonaro’s sons hold two 
of these three positions. 
Many 
have 
been 
angered by the corruption 
within 
Bolsonaro’s 
administration, especially 
in regard to the lack of 
focus on higher education. 
In May, tens of thousands 
of 
students, 
teachers 
and academics stormed 
the streets of São Paulo, 
protesting the Ministry of 
Education’s plan to cut 30 
percent of the funds to the 
discretionary 
expenses 
budget 
for 
universities 
in Brazil. This freeze is 
equivalent to over $1.8 

billion of Brazil’s education 
budget. 
In April, Bolsonaro tweeted 
a 
tweet 
which 
originally 
appeared in Portoguese, stating 
that the Minister of Education 
planned on reducing investment 
in sociology and philosophy 
courses in order to “focus on 
areas that generate immediate 
return to the taxpayer,” like 
engineering and medicine. 
Lessing 
described 
the 
disorder present within the 
Brazilian education system and 
the issues with Bolsonaro’s lack 
of emphasis on the humanities.
“To me, a huge risk that we 
haven’t talked about yet is what 
I see as an attack on the federal 
university system in Brazil,” 
Lessing said. “The attack on 
higher 
education 
— 
which 
(Bolsonaro) sees as infiltrated 
by communism and basically in 
need of flushing out — it’s really 
trying to create chaos within the 
federal university system and 
it’s kind of a vision of you don’t 
need humanities, you don’t need 
social sciences, you just need 
technical education.”
As a Brazillian herself, Corrêa 
described her hesitation with 
teaching in Brazil in the midst 
of the unsupportive education 
system promoted by Bolsonaro.
“So for me particularly, I am 
Brazilian and people often ask 
me if I want to go back to Brazil 
to teach there, but right now, as 
one of the speakers spoke just 
a little bit ago, the Bolsonaro 
government has been kind of 
moving against the university 
system there,” Corrêa said. 
“They have been cutting costs, 
so we’re actually seeing brains 
leaving Brazil to go elsewhere 
in the world that value what 
they’re doing... it’s a really hard 
time right now for the research, 
in the sciences too but especially 
in the humanities.”

Anderson 
cited 
this 
characterization 
as 
her 
major qualm with the title. 
“Notoriously, philosophy 
and also math and physics 
are places where you have 
people believe you have to 
be a ‘genius’ to succeed in 
them,” Anderson said. “And 
those are also disciplines 
— especially physics and 
philosophy — where there 
are very few women, so 
I’m not keen on calling the 
MacArthur Awards ‘Genius 
Awards.’”
In her studies, Anderson 
mainly examines problems 
in the circulation of ideas 
among people. She operates 
under 
the 
pragmatist 
tradition, 
which 
she 
described 
as 
a 
way 
of 
reviewing 
problematic 
experiences to diagnose the 
issue at hand. This line of 
reasoning, Anderson said, 
uses normative thinking to 
find solutions.
When Anderson arrived 
at the University in 1987, 
she was the only woman 
on 
tenure-track 
in 
the 
Philosophy 
Department 
and in 1993, she became the 
first woman to be awarded 
tenure 
from 
within 
the 
department.
Anderson’s experience as 
the only woman on tenure-
track in the department led 
her to seek out colleagues 
in women’s studies to help 
her better understand her 
experience at the University. 
This collaboration prompted 
her to think about feminist 
philosophy, which she said 
has gone on to shape her 
work.
Anderson theorizes under 
non-ideal 
theory, 
which 
requires 
philosophers 
to 
think 
about 
what 
is 
appropriate in an imperfect 
world, rather than operating 
under the assumption the 
world is perfect.
“It was a very problematic 
experience which actually 
led me to my colleagues 
in women’s studies, and 
really 
led 
me 
to 
start 
thinking 
seriously 
about 
feminist 
philosophy, 
partly just to understand 
my 
own 
experiences 
of 
what it’s like to kind of be 
a gatecrasher in an all-
male 
domain,” 
Anderson 
said. “It’s interesting that 
a large number of feminist 
philosophers are attracted 
to the pragmatist tradition, 
because pragmatism always 
starts with problems, not 

with utopia.”
Peter Railton, professor of 
philosophy, said Anderson’s 
research 
on 
democratic 
theory 
and 
equality 
in 
political 
philosophy 
is 
unmatched. He explained 
her interest in the historical 
dimension of all political 
changes 
and 
ways 
to 
translate 
understanding 
into action makes her unique 
in the philosophy world.
Railton said he is unaware 
of any living philosopher 
whose 
work 
better 
understands the value of 
philosophy in a changing 
world. He compared her 
work to that of John Dewey, 
Anderson’s 
profesorship’s 
namesake 
who 
was 
an 
American 
philosopher 
whose 
work 
influenced 
education and social reform.
“She is certainly one of 
the leading contemporary 
philosophers 
working 
in 
English and her work is 
known worldwide … but 
this fellowship I don’t think 
is for being well-known, 
or even being widely read, 
it’s for being distinctive,” 
Railton said. “She has really 
been a pioneer in a half-
dozen fields, and she’s done 
seminal work, so it’s easy to 
see why she was viewed as a 
distinctive philosopher.”
Additionally, 
Railton 
said her work has enriched 
diversity and inclusion, and 
she has both personally and 
professionally enhanced the 
University community.
Rackham student Mercy 
Corredor said Anderson’s 
reputation 
for 
enhancing 
the 
University 
is 
well 
known among philosophy 
students. When Corredor 
first arrived as a graduate 
student in philosophy, she 
said she felt out of place, but 
taking Anderson’s class first 
semester made her feel at 
home in the discipline.
After building a rapport 
with 
Anderson 
through 
the class, Corredor asked 
Anderson 
to 
chair 
her 
dissertation 
committee. 
Now in her fifth year of 
graduate school, Corredor 
described Anderson as a 
teacher who is genuinely 
happy to work with students.
“She 
just 
genuinely 
gets really excited about 
hearing ideas put in new and 
interesting ways,” Corredor 
said. “From the student side 
of it, nothing feels better 
than that — the advisor you 
respect so much genuinely 
getting excited about the 
things you think about.”
As for why Anderson’s 
work 
is 
worthy 
of 
recognition 
from 
the 

MacArthur 
Foundation, 

Corredor 
described 

her 
work 
in 
democracy 
and 
equality 
has 
been 
“revolutionary.” 
Corredor 
also noted the importance 
of 
Anderson’s 
problem-
focused, 
solution-oriented 
approach to philosophy.
“She has an incredible 
nose for finding important 
problems that are affecting 
people in the world, and 
she goes there and then 
theorizes 
as 
a 
way 
of 
alleviating those problems,” 
Corredor said. “A lot of 
philosophers like to look in 
the other direction, where 
they 
do 
the 
theorizing 
first, and then go out into 
the world and see if they 
can apply the theories to 
the people — and that’s 
the opposite of what she’s 
doing. 
She 
really 
cares 
about 
people 
and 
their 
problems. That’s part of her 
pragmatist approach, and 
so that is what motivates 
her work first and foremost 
and this is what makes her 
a really incredible scholar.”
Currently, Anderson is on 
leave from the University 
to work on two books — 
one on the history and 
contemporary significance 
of the Protestant work ethic 
and the other on the ethics 
of political communication. 
Anderson 
said 
she 
is 
interested in writing for a 
broad audience so people 
can understand her work 
and apply it to the social-
political problems present 
in their everyday lives.
Anderson, who has been 
as LSA professor for more 
than three decades, said 
the 
University 
has 
seen 
many changes from when 
she was the only female 
tenure-track professor in 
her department in the late 
1980s. However, Anderson 
said she has always been 
impressed 
with 
the 
University’s commitment to 
interdisciplinary research.
“University of Michigan 
is just a fantastic place 
to be doing research like 
this 
because 
there 
are 
so few barriers between 
departments, schools, units 
and programs,” Anderson 
said. “Everybody is really 
interested 
in 
talking 
to 
everyone else — interested 
in each other’s research 
— and it’s not like at other 
schools where departments 
are siloed and insulated 
from each other. So that’s 
the reason why I’ve chosen 
to stay here and make my 
career here, because it’s 
just an amazing intellectual 
environment.”

MACARTHUR
From Page 1A

State 
Rep. 
Yousef 
Rabhi, 
D-Ann Arbor, said the budgets 
that made it to Whitmer’s 
desk fell short compared to 
the 
proposal 
Whitmer 
first 
offered in March, which called 
for a 3 percent increase in 
funding to Michigan colleges 
and universities while capping 
tuition hikes at 3.2 percent.
“The governor proposed a 
budget with funding that was a 
lot higher than what the House 
ended up sending her, and I was 
disappointed to see that,” Rabhi 
said. “I was very supportive of 
the governor’s budget as she 
initially introduced it, I think 
that the increase that she had 
included was still even not 
enough, but way better than the 
1 percent, or in some cases, less 
than 1 percent increase that the 
legislature gave, which to our 15 
public universities, in my beliefs, 
is completely unacceptable.”
In 
a 
statement, 
Cynthia 
Wilbanks, vice president for 
government relations, also said 
she found the approved budget 
disappointing.
“We know that in order for 
our state economy to be strong, 
we will need a more educated 
workforce in the years to come,” 
Wilbanks said. “Unfortunately, 
this 
budget 
falls 
short 
in 
addressing our state’s pressing 
need and shifts even more of the 
cost burden to our students and 
families.”
Rabhi said the governor’s 
decision to veto certain items 
was a result of her limited 
options.

“Part 
of 
the 
issue 
that 
Governor Whitmer was facing 
is that she can only veto items 
and 
move 
funding 
around 
within a departmental budget,” 
Rabhi said. “But she cannot 
add funding to a departmental 
budget, so she was not able 
to add any money. She was 
basically faced, I think, with 
the decision of do we want to 
eliminate all funding to our 
universities and renegotiate it, 
or do we take what we can get 
for now, and negotiate for more 
later.”
Rabhi 
said 
Democratic 
lawmakers wanted a larger 
increase in funding for higher 
education funding. 
“I 
wanted 
more 
money,” 
Rabhi said. “I ultimately voted 
no on the higher education 
budget, because I wanted to 
send a strong message and 
the rest of the Democratic 
Caucus wanted to send a strong 
message I think it was, you 
know, near-unanimous within 
the Democratic Caucus, that 
we were opposed to the higher 
education budget as it was 
presented.”
The budget kept funding 
constant for two financial aid 
programs utilized by University 
students: 
the 
Michigan 
Competitive 
Scholarship, 
which supports students with 
a qualifying score on the ACT 
or SAT who have demonstrated 
financial need, and the Tuition 
Incentive 
Program, 
which 
benefits 
students 
of 
lower 
socioeconomic 
status 
with 
tuition assistance. Each of the 
programs received $6 million in 
additional funding last year.
Public Policy junior Camille 
Mancuso, 
communications 

director for the University’s 
chapter of College Democrats, 
said 
the 
state 
failed 
to 
meaningfully invest in post-
secondary education.
“While the state of Michigan 
has increased funding for U-M, 
there is still an apparent lack 
of meaningful investment in 
higher 
education,” 
Mancuso 
said. “The University’s tuition 
has increased over the past 
years, 
and 
there 
remains 
significant inequities between 
funding granted to U-M Ann 
Arbor compared to U-M Flint or 
U-M Dearborn.” 
The 
Board 
of 
Regents 
approved a budget for the 
University in June based in part 
on expected state funds, which 
they calculated would be $375.9 
million. The actual amount of 
state funding — a total of $373 
across the University’s three 
campuses — falls short of that 
project, leaving a revenue gap 
for the University to address.
Rabhi 
framed 
funding 
decisions for universities as an 
issue of accessibility.
“Regardless of where you 
live in the state of Michigan or 
how much money you make, it’s 
important that our universities 
do 
serve 
everyone,” 
Rabhi 
said. “Now that should be, in 
my opinion, a call to action 
for universities to ensure that 
they 
focus 
on 
accessibility 
so that every student in the 
state of Michigan feels that 
they can draw value from our 
15 universities in the state of 
Michigan. They should serve 
everyone.”
A representative from the 
University’s chapter of College 
Republicans 
declined 
to 
comment.

Following 
the 
doctor’s 
decision, 
a 
Facebook 
page 
titled 
“Save 
Bobby” 
was 
created by the Reyes family’s 
friends and relatives. The page 
is intended to raise awareness 
about 
Bobby’s 
case, 
offer 
support to those close to him, 
and share information about 
potential medical alternatives. 
In the page’s description, the 
family pleads for community 
support and time. 
“I’m trying to be strong even 
though I don’t feel strong,” 
Jones said to The Daily. “I’m 
so weak. I’m tired. But I’m 
not going to quit fighting for 
my son as long as his heart is 
beating. I will be fighting for 
him to my last breath. And I 
said, whatever happens, it’s in 
God’s hands. If God takes my 
son while he’s on life support, 
you know, we’ll make peace 
with it, but I’ll never have 
peace with knowing that I 
consented to pulling the plug 
on my son when he’s still here.”
A GoFundMe page was set 
up to help the family pay for 
legal fees associated with the 
court order and other costs to 
assist the family during this 
difficult time. Since it was 
published six days ago, it has 
raised more than $8,200. 

“Every 
minute 
we 
have 
with him is a miracle,” Jones 
said. “He’s fighting, and I’m 
fighting harder for him. But 
we just want to bring attention 
to what’s going on at the 
hospitals, because I’m not the 
only one.”
Mary Masson, director of 
public relations for Michigan 
Medicine, said in an email 
statement 
to 
The 
Daily 
Tuesday the hospital would 
continue to support the family.
“All of us empathize with 
the extraordinarily emotional 
process that families facing 
such matters go through,” 
Masson 
wrote. 
“Michigan 
Medicine follows the State of 
Michigan law on determination 
of 
death, 
and 
conducts 
extensive 
testing 
before 
determining there is brain 
death due to the irreversible 
cessation of all functions of the 
entire brain. Our team of highly 
experienced and specialized 
nurses, 
doctors 
and 
other 
health professionals exhaust 
every available option to help 
patients who are critically ill.”
William Amadeo is one of 
the attorneys helping out the 
family. He said he heard about 
the case through social media.
“There were so many people 
that reached out to me on 
Facebook about a kid that’s 
dying,” Amadeo said. “I want 
to do my role to try to help 
the family. I mean, if there’s a 

chance that Bobby could live I 
thought I was obligated to try 
to help.”
Amadeo 
said 
his 
work 
typically focuses on criminal 
law, but he felt compelled to 
take on Bobby’s case pro bono.
“There 
are 
cases 
when 
people are in need, I’ll jump 
in,” Amadeo said. “But this was 
the first actual situation with 
somebody who was actually 
deemed brain dead and I was 
trying to help them out, so it 
was kind of a new experience 
for everybody.”
Amadeo said he worked with 
an attorney for the University 
to get the hospital records 
straightened 
out 
for 
the 
family and asked for people to 
continue to support the family.
“At this point, you need to 
find another doctor, and the 
family is doing everything 
possible for that,” Amadeo 
said. 
Jones said she’s trying to 
move her son to a different 
hospital.
“Now we need to find a place 
to get him out of here because 
he needs to go someplace else 
that wants to help him and 
doesn’t want to talk about, you 
know, pressuring his parents 
to do something that they don’t 
agree with,” Jones said. “You 
got to go with your gut as a 
mother and my gut is telling 
me to fight ‘til my last breath 
for my son.”

LIFE-SUPPORT

They also discussed neighbor 
outreach, with plans for meetings 
with library staff, Kempf House 
Museum staff, nearby residents, 
nearby business owners, Ann 
Arbor Transportation Authority 
representatives and Downtown 
Development 
Authority 
members. 
Task force members Norman 
Tyler and Ann Dilcher proposed 
an activity for the public meeting 
where the group is shown photos 
of urban spaces, in order to find 
out what aspects Ann Arbor 

residents envision for this space. 
“We’re trying to get some 
feedback on the kinds of urban 
space that people would feel 
most comfortable with,” Tyler 
said. “It’s a very simple device 
to see what people like and 
they don’t like, and then ask 
for comments. I think people 
need to be educated, and we’re 
educating ourselves with this 
input.”
LSA 
senior 
Hannah 
Boettcher, the only student on 
the committee, described her 
role as a student spokesperson 
and her excitement to engage 
with the community.
“Organization has been our 
big struggle lately, just to get 

things moving, get the ball 
rolling on events,” Boettcher 
said. “But I’m hopeful towards 
the future because we have 
these community engagement 
events on the records. It’s 
important to me that these 
community engagement events 
are really inclusive of the actual 
community, and I’m speaking 
specifically now towards the 
university student community, 
that’s a voice that can very easily 
be lost in these discussions.”
The agenda for the next 
meeting will include further 
discussion of mailing, plans for 
the Nov. 6 meeting, discussion of 
public engagement, and website 
development. 

TASK FORCE
From Page 1A

On Monday, Court of Claims 
Judge Cynthia Stevens denied a 
request to temporarily postpone 
Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s 
ban on flavored e-cigarettes 
that took effect Tuesday.
The emergency order, which 
bans the sale of all flavored 
nicotine liquid and the use of 
flavors to market e-cigarettes, 
was announced on Sept. 17. 
Retailers were given two weeks 
from the announcement to sell 
or dispose of their products. 
The request was part of a 
lawsuit filed by Mark Slis, owner 
of 906 Vapor in Houghton, 
Michigan. U.S. District Court 
Judge Robert Jonker denied a 
similar request made by Mister 
E-Liquid, a Grand Rapids-based 
vape shop on Monday.
Slis’s lawsuit was filed in 
Houghton County Circuit Court. 
It claimed the rules violate 
Michigan state laws and asked 
for a temporary restraining 
order 
and 
a 
preliminary 
injunction to postpone the ban. 
The 
temporary 
restraining 
order 
was 
denied, 
and 
a 
hearing was held Monday for 
the 
preliminary 
injunction. 
The judge took no action and 
postponed the hearing until 
Oct. 8. 
In his testimony before the 
Michigan House Oversight 
Committee, Slis offered a 
personal story about flavored 
e-cigarettes helping him with 
his smoking addiction. He 
also discussed how the ban 
will affect his business and 
similar businesses across the 
state. 
“If 
the 
governor’s 
order 
stands and flavors are banned, 
I 
will 
go 
immediately 
go 
out of business,” Slis said. 
“I will immediately file for 
bankruptcy. 
No 
question. 
I 
think my experience will be 
mirrored across the state.” 

The lawsuit filed by Mister-E 
Liquid cites similar concerns, 
saying the company would be 
forced to shut down, leave the 
state of Michigan, and lay off 
employees. 
LSA junior Blake Richards 
used to use a Juul electronic 
cigarette 
but 
has 
recently 
quit 
because 
of 
mental 
health effects and decreased 
motivation and energy levels. 
He explained how he thought 
the ban would affect vape 
shops in Ann Arbor. 
“From 
what 
I’ve 
heard, 
several 
vape 
shops 
will 
essentially 
replace 
e-liquid 
with CBD oils, tinctures, etc. 
as CBD is becoming more and 
more popular,” Richards said. 
“I would imagine that this is 
why Gretchen Whitmer gave 
about a month’s notice.” 
He also explained he thought 
the ban would work and was 
worth 
possible 
short-term 
harm. 
“While I couldn’t speculate 
the percentage, I do think 
a large amount of kids will 
quit smoking,” Richards said. 
“Especially if they’re relatively 
new smokers. From personal 
experience, 
tobacco-flavored 
e-liquid was only tolerable for 
a few hits in the morning and 
just a few more throughout 
the day. And cigarettes leave 
a horrible taste in your mouth 
and most people know they are 
filled with carcinogens, tar and 
about a dozen other chemicals 
that shouldn’t ever be in your 
lungs.”
When she announced the 
ban, Whitmer said her order 
followed a finding by Joneigh 
Khaldun, 
Michigan’s 
chief 
medical executive, that youth 
vaping was a public health 
crisis. In a statement, Khaldun 
said the increase in vaping 
among 
young 
people 
was 
alarming. 
“In the past few years, we’ve 
seen an explosive increase in 

the number of Michigan kids 
exposed to vaping products,” 
Khaldun said. “This is a public 
health crisis. These products 
can contain harmful chemicals 
that put our kids’ health at risk. 
I’m looking forward to working 
with Governor Whitmer to 
mitigate these effects and keep 
our kids healthy.”
There have been concerns the 
ban would cause users to switch 
to cigarettes in the absence of 
an alternative. 
Michigan was the first state 
to enact a ban on flavored 
nicotine liquid. Since Whitmer 
announced 
the 
order, 
New 
York, 
Massachusetts, 
Rhode 
Island 
and 
California 
have 
taken 
similar 
actions. 
The 
Trump 
administration 
has 
also announced an interest in 
enacting a similar policy. 
“We’re 
looking 
at 
very 
strong rules and regulations. 
We already have laws as we 
need them,” President Donald 
Trump said in a Sept. 11 press 
conference. “But we want to get 
to the bottom of a very unusual 
situation. It’s so new, and it’s 
become so big, so fast. And it 
could be a potential very severe 
problem.”
Alex Azar, United States 
Secretary 
of 
Health 
and 
Human 
Services, 
also 
gave 
a brief statement about the 
administration’s 
ban 
and 
explained its goal of reducing 
the number of children using 
e-cigarettes.
“So, with the President’s 
support, the Food and Drug 
Administration 
intends 
to 
finalize a guidance document 
that 
would 
commence 
enforcement to require that 
all flavors, other than tobacco 
flavor, would be removed from 
the market,” Azar said. “So, 
once the FDA would finalize 
this guidance, we would begin 
enforcement actions to remove 
all such products from the 
marketplace.”

F

elicity 
Huffman, 
who 
plays 
Lynette 
in 
“Desperate 
Housewives,” 
was 
sentenced 
in 
early 
September 
for 
her 
role in the college 
admissions 
scam. 
For those of you that 
don’t 
remember, 
that 
was 
when 
the 
University 
of 
Southern California 
(and 
a 
few 
other 
selective 
schools) 
vaulted to the front 
pages of The Wall Street Journal 
and other newspapers for taking 
bribes for admissions spots. 
Now, 
Huffman 
has 
been 
sentenced for her actions in 
helping the Trojans beclown 
themselves yet again, to 14 days 
in the slammer, one year of 
probation, a $30,000 fine and 
a requirement that she wear 
Stanford gear for the next eight 
months. That last one is a lie, 
but the rest of it is true. Upon 
reading her sentence, I was 
struck by a couple of things.
First, it seemed like a fair 
sentence to me. I obviously 
think the actions of the parents 
were pretty shameful but, at 
the end of the day, these actions 
didn’t really hurt anyone. You 
could make a case that not 
getting into some of those 
schools had injurious effects 
or devalued your degree and — 
indicating the desperate need 
for tort reform — you could even 
file a lawsuit along those lines. 
However, 
you 
should 
do 
none of those things because, 
ultimately, 
Huffman 
got 
sentenced in a manner that 
was pretty fair relative to her 
crime. She’s not a murderer – 
why treat her like one? This 
principle should be applied 
to more than just Huffman, 
though. For example, when 
Tanya McDowell used her son’s 
babysitter’s address to register 
her son in school, she absolutely 
should not have gotten five 

years in prison. 
McDowell 
and 
Huffman’s 
respective cases illustrate a 
number 
of 
things, 
but 
two 
to 
point 
out are the obvious 
racial 
difference 
and the inefficiency 
of criminal justice. 
Both of these crimes 
were 
committed 
by 
mothers 
and 
both were in the 
educational 
field 
and, to be honest, 
neither 
one 
needs 
a five-year sentence. I’m open 
to the argument that neither 
one needs a sentence at all, 
which brings me to point out 
the obvious inefficiencies here. 
Keeping people locked up is not 
cheap and, all in all, is a pretty 
bad use of state resources. 
Decades 
of 
just 
throwing 
homeless people behind bars 
has yet to yield positive results 
and yet we continue as if we 
have a collective memory span 
than a fruit fly. Instead of 
wasting taxpayer resources on 
an endless scheme of locking 
up nonviolent offenders along 
with the less fortunate, there 
should be investments made 
in 
rehabilitation 
and 
social 
services as those have much 
better returns on investment for 
the community and much better 
results for those who utilize 
them. 
Second, this made me think 
about Lori Loughlin and her 
case. She reportedly regrets 
not taking a plea deal early on 
and deciding to go to court, 
because she and her husband 
got hit with additional charges 
after that. And, since Huffman 
got prison time, she almost 
certainly will as well. It seems 
unfair that choosing to go trial 
will cause negative impacts 
out of the gate, as we all have 
a 
Sixth 
Amendment 
right 
to a speedy and public trial. 
However, 
in 
practice, 
what 
happened to Loughlin is the 

norm. Defendants who choose 
to plead not guilty and go to 
trial routinely receive harsher 
punishments than those who 
take plea deals, and this is a 
well known threat to induce 
confessions – innocence be 
damned. 
Huffman 
and 
Loughlin 
(and the rest of the clown car) 
did something that’s bad. You 
could look at it in a positive 
light if you want my against-
the-grain take but not many 
people do (for obvious reasons). 
Neither of these two women 
are convenient avatars for the 
injustices that are part and 
parcel of the criminal justice 
system but that does not mean 
that we should ignore the 
lessons that we can take from 
this event.
First, USC is a bit of a joke. 
Second, Huffman getting a 
light sentence for a pretty light 
crime is a good thing, and if 
more people got those kinds of 
sentences, it would generally 
be a better world and making 
these sentences harder to get 
through a trial is on the merits, 
bad. A nation ruled by lawyers 
will 
always 
be 
procedural 
hell and there is no reason at 
all to encourage that. Third, 
Loughlin choosing to go to trial 
and appearing to get a harsher 
punishment for it is not a good 
thing. We all have a right to 
a fair trial, and it shouldn’t 
be 
unnecessarily 
abrogated. 
People 
will 
say 
that 
we 
shouldn’t care about Huffman’s 
and Loughlin’s run-ins with 
justice, and while I see their 
point, I disagree. The people 
who usually deal with that 
system are far less privileged, 
far less rich and oftentimes 
far less white. If some of the 
lessons from these cases can 
be applied a little more broadly, 
it’d be a much better country for 
all of us.

Felicity Huffman and the criminal justice we deserve

SOLOMON MEDINTZ | COLUMN

AB5 attacks the heart of the gig economy

T

his year’s most important 
bill for the future of work 
passed in California in 
September, and we should all take 
note. The law — Assembly Bill 5 
— sets a new definition for what it 
means to be an employee, and it is 
the most direct legislative affront 
to the so-called “gig economy” 
yet. AB5 sends the right message, 
but it now seems too late. The gig 
economy and the companies that 
have made it are too far and too 
powerful.
The timing of this bill is 
significant 
because 
the 
gig 
economy — where independent 
workers are paid by the individual 
job instead of a wage or salary — is 
growing quickly. By 2027, according 
to one model, approximately 50 
percent of workers in the United 
States will not be tied to a specific 
employer. Instead, they will do 
some freelance or gig work. It is a 
dangerous trend. It signifies the 
end of a work culture in which 
employees rely on their employers 
for social insurance. 
The gig economy has grown 
because employment has become 
more of a burden and finding quick 
work has become easier. It has led 
companies to do everything in their 
power to classify their workers 
as independent contractors and 
not full employees. For their 
employees, employers have to 
provide unemployment and health 
insurance, pay for parental leave 
and overtime, abide by minimum 
wage laws and grant the right to 
form a union. For independent 
contractors, employers are off the 
hook for all of it. 
Specifically, AB5 clearly lays out 
the criteria for classifying a worker 
as an independent contractor, in 
contrast to the vague federal law 
under which most states operate. 
AB5 
says 
that 
independent 
contractors are those who are not 
under company control, whose 
work is not the core part of the 
company’s business and that has 
an independent business in the 
industry.
This law will have enormous 
consequences for gig workers 
across the state and their employers, 
but most saliently for Uber and 
Lyft. Under AB5, drivers will get 
all the employee benefits they have 
missed as independent contractors. 

The National Employment Law 
Project estimates that it is 30 
percent cheaper for employers to 
hire someone as an independent 
contractor than as an employee, 
a 
potentially 
crippling 
blow 
for companies that are already 
running deficits.
But they will not go down 
without a fight. Uber and Lyft are 
up in arms over AB5 because it has 
the potential to reverberate around 
the country. The rival companies 
recently united to pour $90 million 
into a lobbying campaign to fight 
the bill and its implementation – 
and their efforts underscore how 
they cannot be trusted to give fair 
deals to their drivers.
Their campaign has three parts. 
The first is the standard libertarian 
messaging 
that 
government 
regulation is limiting business. 
They are not wrong. Uber and Lyft 
will suffer as companies, drivers 
may not have as much flexibility and 
wait times and ride fares will likely 
rise. However, tech companies that 
rely on the gig economy should see 
AB5 as a challenge that needs to 
be faced. If forcing the companies 
to comply with standard labor law 
is a gut punch, Uber and Lyft’s 
business model needs to become 
more resilient. 
The second part of the campaign 
has been to try and mobilize 
drivers against AB5. But this 
effort has been full of deceit and 
intimidation. In early June, drivers 
were asked to sign petitions to 
support flexible hours without 
realizing 
they 
were 
fighting 
against employee classification. 
Some drivers were also under 
the impression that signing the 
petition was mandatory, including 
drivers for whom English is a 
second language.
The tech companies’ negotiating 
tactics 
show 
how 
necessary 
confrontational 
organizing 
is. 
Drivers have been protesting how 
the companies take excessive 
portions of fares for years, but Uber 
and Lyft did nothing because their 
independent contractors did not 
have the capacity to collectively 
organize. Only after AB5 picked 
up 
steam 
in 
the 
California 
legislature did Uber roll out a 
compromise plan, even though its 
concessions were weak. Uber and 
Lyft marketed the proposal as a 

$21 minimum wage, but since 
that wage only applies to drivers 
who are actively picking up or 
with passengers, drivers would 
still be making below California 
minimum wage. 
It is easy to frame AB5 as an 
unequivocal win. But under the 
law, Uber and Lyft can still make 
the working lives of their drivers 
terrible, and have suggested 
that they will. First, they have 
suggested that they will just 
ignore the new law. More likely 
and thus more concerning is what 
kind of retribution the companies 
will deliver to their drivers. The 
biggest question is what will 
happen to driver flexibility. Lots 
of Uber and Lyft drivers say that 
without the ability to choose their 
own hours, they would not work. 
This is especially true for drivers 
who work other jobs, quasi-
retirees who will not commit 
to working different hours and 
students with irregular schedules. 
When AB5 comes into effect, 
Uber and Lyft say they may have 
to start setting hour minimums 
or preventing certain drivers 
from logging on in low-traffic 
areas. The bill’s supporters have 
countered that AB5 does compel 
Uber and Lyft to implement such 
restrictions. If they do, it would be 
by their own volition. 
There is a way to address the 
ambiguities of AB5 as well as 
Uber and Lyft’s public relations 
campaign 
against 
the 
bill 
that will send a clear message 
to the gig economy. Instead 
of mandating drivers have a 
different relationship with their 
employers, they should be able to 
choose whether to be classified 
as employees or independent 
contractors. The drivers putting 
in 50 hours in the car per week 
are employees who deserve the 
rights that label entails. But 
the drivers who are actually 
independent 
contractors 
could 
retain the flexibility they need. 
If the vast majority of drivers 
choose to be employees instead of 
independent contractors, it would 
send an unequivocal statement of 
opposition to the gig economy, one 
that Uber and Lyft cannot muddle.

L

ast year, a coalition of 
University of Michigan 
faculty 
and 
students 
launched the One University 
(1U) campaign, with the goal of 
advocating for more equitable 
funding across U-M’s three 
campuses. 
The 
campaign’s 
efforts 
culminated 
in 
May 
with the opportunity to speak 
directly to the Board of Regents 
at their meeting in Dearborn, 
after which the board did not 
implement the changes that 
1U sought out. Despite this 
setback, 
the 
movement 
has 
built considerable momentum, 
with several regents expressing 
support 
and 
multiple 
state 
lawmakers publishing an op-ed 
advancing the 1U’s viewpoint.
1U’s 
argument 
is 
simple: 
The University’s Ann Arbor 
campus is substantially better-
funded than either of the Flint 
or Dearborn campuses 
– a 
problem exacerbated by the fact 
that Ann Arbor students tend 
to be from significantly more 
advantaged backgrounds. The 
argument of those who oppose 
the coalition’s view, such as 
University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel, is also simple: The 
three campuses have different 
purposes and different goals, 
and the funding stream reflects 
that. While I’ve always found 
the “different goals” argument 
to be a dismissive response to 
a highly consequential issue, I 
also have been hesitant to fully 
embrace 1U’s mission. 
Most of the people I had heard 
advocate for 1U were either 
students at Flint and Dearborn 
— who only had things to gain 
— and Ann Arbor students like 
me, who come from wealthier 
backgrounds 
and 
would 
therefore 
be 
well-insulated 
from the impacts of budget cuts. 
On the other hand, many of my 
friends in Ann Arbor come from 
small towns in rural Michigan 
and are not necessarily better off 
financially than those students 
at Flint or Dearborn.
Moreover, 
research 
shows 
that students who attend U-M’s 
Ann Arbor campus from less 
wealthy backgrounds are nearly 
twice as likely to move up the 
income ladder as students at 
Flint or Dearborn. Initially, 
I worried that budget cuts 
could reduce U-M Ann Arbor’s 
effectiveness as a platform for 
social mobility for people like 
my friends, either by harming 
the quality of the education 

they had worked hard for, or by 
reducing the financial aid they 
depended on to go here.
However, when I actually set 
out to look into the budgets of the 
three campuses, I realized that 
1U was stating their case in the 
most conservative way possible. 
1U’s research already indicates 
that Ann Arbor students receive 
over 
twice 
as 
much 
state 
funding per student and well 
over twice as much total funding 
in comparison to Flint and 
Dearborn. But this is calculated 
based only on the U-M General 
Budget. The General Budget, 
which comprises only of the 
revenue that U-M generates 
through 
tuition 
and 
state 
funding, accounts for less than 
a quarter of U-M Ann Arbor’s 
funding, as compared to over 80 
percent of funding for the other 
two campuses.
The rest of Ann Arbor’s 
funding comes from interest off 
of its $11.9 billion endowment, 
research 
grants 
from 
foundations and the federal 
government, designated funds 
and 
“auxiliary” 
components 
of the campus, like Michigan 
Medicine and Campus Housing, 
which 
generate 
their 
own 
revenue. These funding streams, 
which result from the Ann 
Arbor campus’ status as a world-
renowned research university 
with wealthy alumni, are simply 
less to the other campuses. Once 
these other funding streams 
are factored in, the calculations 
show that state funding shrinks 
to 3 percent of the Ann Arbor 
campus’ total budget, compared 
to over 15 percent on both 
of the other campuses. The 
endowment interest alone brings 
in millions of dollars more than 
the totality of state funding. 
This means state funding for 
U-M 
Ann 
Arbor 
students, 
which, to reiterate, is twice that 
of Dearborn and Flint, is barely 
significant in the context of the 
campus’ total budget.
Thinking about my initial 
reservations 
about 
1U’s 
arguments, 
I 
looked 
into 
financial aid. Unsurprisingly, 
the Ann Arbor campus spends 
only a miniscule amount of its 
total budget of financial aid – 
just 3 percent compared to 10 
percent and 18 percent at the 
Flint and Dearborn campuses 
respectively. Since U-M Ann 
Arbor also relies so little on 
state funding, this means that 
reallocating state appropriations 

would 
be 
unlikely 
to 
significantly affect financial aid 
on the Ann Arbor campus.
To get a sense of how big the 
effect of reallocations might 
be, I did some back-of-the-
envelope calculations. I held 
each campus’s percent spending 
on financial aid constant, and 
transferred an amount equal 
to one quarter of the Ann 
Arbor campus’s state funding 
to the other two campuses. 
The result? Average financial 
aid packages in Dearborn and 
Flint by increased by over 15 
percent, while reducing Ann 
Arbor students’ financial aid 
by less than one percent. In 
light of numbers like these, the 
current funding structure isn’t 
simply unfair or inequitable: 
It’s completely at odds with 
common sense. 
Of course, the effect of 
reallocations 
might 
not 
be 
exactly what I found. There 
is a good reason why 1U only 
considers the General Fund 
in 
their 
calculations: 
much 
of the rest of the budget 
is 
earmarked 
for 
specific 
activities. Endowment donors 
want their money spent on 
specific programs, foundation 
funding is tied to particular 
research projects, and units like 
Michigan Medicine need much 
of their revenue to carry out 
daily operations. However, these 
funds heavily subsidize many of 
the activities, such as research, 
student services and financial 
aid, that are also paid out of the 
General Fund. Not accounting 
for these components completely 
disregards 
the 
enormous 
amount of funding that benefits 
Ann Arbor students at the cost 
of those in other campuses.
Ultimately, the Ann Arbor 
campus simply doesn’t need 
state funding the way that either 
the Flint or Dearborn campuses 
do. U-M Dearborn and Flint 
students 
come 
from 
less 
advantaged backgrounds and 
receive less funding and support 
even while their schools dedicate 
much larger portions of their 
budget to serve students. These 
disparities 
across 
campuses 
can’t be erased, but it’s clear that 
they can be easily improved. 
What isn’t clear is why Schlissel, 
the Board of Regents, and the 
state legislature refuse to take 
action.

Big Ten reacts to NIL law with mix of apprehension, ignorance and support

ROSEMONT, Ill. — On Monday, 
the college athletics world was 
rocked to its core.
California Gov. Gavin Newsome 
signed a bill into law that, starting 
in 2023, allows college athletes to 
benefit off their name, image and 
likeness (NIL). It’s the beginning 
of the payoff of a social movement 
that 
rallied 
professional 
and 
amateur athletes alike to push 
for the right of athletes to benefit 
off the name on the back of their 
jersey, as well as the name on the 
front.
So it’s no doubt that this issue 
cast a large shadow over Big Ten 
Media Day on Wednesday. With 
the ground shifting beneath their 
feet, coaches from programs both 
big and small were quick to get 
ahead of the issue and take a stance 
on the topic.
Some 
chose 
to 
champion 
the issue. Some chose to plead 
ignorance. But none outwardly 
said the move was bad for the 
world of college athletics and 
all that universities do for their 
players. That is, except Big Ten 
Commissioner Jim Delaney.
His argument rests on the back 
of a claim that with only 1 or 2 
percent of college athletes likely to 
profit from this new rule, why spoil 
the fun for the rest of the field? 
Kicking off the day’s festivities 
with his opinion on the issue, 
Delaney argued that the sport of 
basketball takes place in many 
environments, some of which pay 
their players and some of which do 
not. The Big Ten and the NCAA do 
not.
“We’re not perfect,” Delaney 
said, 
“but 
I 
think 
that 
the 
opportunities that we have for the 
great many shouldn’t be sacrificed 
to the one percent who would 
probably have an opportunity to 
benefit here.
“It’s a college game. It’s different 
than the NBA, different than the 
Olympics and different than the 
playground. So I think that we’re 
able to maintain the opportunities 

that we have for men and women 
and avoid pay-for-play so far as we 
can.”
As 
it 
stands 
now, 
the 
California bill would not limit the 
opportunities for the majority of 
college athletes who won’t have a 
shot to profit off their likeness. So 
how this new law might potentially 
take away from these athletes 
in the Big Ten remains unclear, 
but one thing is: the door to NIL 
profits for college athletes has been 
opened.
With this development comes 
many concerns for coaches outside 
the state of California. Now that 
student athletes in the golden state 
may have the opportunity to net 
extra profits, any recruit with NBA 
aspirations and common sense will 
make a mad dash out west. The 
question now turns to leveling the 
playing field.
“I think there’s still ways we 
need to learn because we do have 
to keep this on a level playing 
field,” said Penn State coach Pat 
Chambers, “because if it gets out 
of whack, well we’re gonna lose 
out because of recruiting when it 
comes to being competitive in the 
Big Ten and across the country.”
For many athletes and coaches, 
the question is about fairness.
What do you imagine when you 
think of the traditional college 
athlete? A pimple-faced teenager 
struggling 
to 
handle 
both 
transition defense 
and introductory 
biology? Perhaps. 
What 
about 
a 
married, 
father 
of two with bills 
to pay, mouths to 
feed and a whole 
course 
load 
to 
balance? If that 
doesn’t 
sound 
right, then meet Michigan State 
forward Xavier Tillman.
When discussing the issue of 
pay to play, Tillman was quick to 
admit that a few extra dollars in 
his pocket would go a long way 
in filling the gaps his scholarship 
can’t quite cover towards expenses 

such as child care. The junior also 
posited that the California ruling 
could aid NBA-bound players in 
navigating the business end of 
things surrounding monetizing a 
player’s 
athletic 
ability.
“I 
think 
it’s 
good 
just 
to 
educate 
NBA 
prospects 
or 
college 
players 
who 
have 
the 
potential to play 
in 
the 
NBA,” 
Tillman said. “To 
educate them on 
business decisions 
and stuff like that when they go to 
the NBA Draft, so it’ll be kind of 
nice for them.”
Other players, like the Nittany 
Lions’ Lamar Stevens, thinks it’s 
just flat-out wrong that others, such 
as colleges and administrators, 
are profiting off a college athlete’s 

name and face – especially when 
that athlete may be struggling. 
Michigan junior forward Isaiah 
Livers echoed this sentiment, 
arguing that college players don’t 
have other opportunities to earn 
cash, so this new development will 
be welcomed by those struggling to 
make ends meet.
“At a time when you literally 
have to spend money on your 
rent, those are the things you’re 
thinking about,” Livers said. “You 
can’t spend this money because 
you have to save it for something 
that has to be paid for, and it’s kind 
of dangerous like, ‘Man, I don’t 
have the money to eat.’ You have to 
go to a dorm and have someone let 
you in, go get East Quad or South 
Quad food, and it’s sad man.”
Joining Tillman and Livers, 
there were several Big Ten coaches 
who voiced active encouragement 
of the ruling despite potentially 
disruptive 
unintended 

consequences. Minnesota coach 
Richard Pitino, Iowa coach Fran 
McCaffrey and Nebraska coach 
Fred Hoiberg were among some of 
the big names who thought of the 
bill as progress 
for their student 
athletes.
Others, 
like 
new 
Michigan 
coach 
Juwan 
Howard 
or 
Michigan 
State 
coach 
Tom 
Izzo, were more 
apprehensive. 
Howard, making 
$2 
million 
this year, claimed ignorance on 
the issue, stating that he is too 
preoccupied 
with 
getting 
the 
reigns under control of his program 
to lend any thought on the issue. 
Izzo on the other hand, making 
$4.3 million this year, had done his 
research and still is unsure about 

the consequences despite voicing 
support in helping athletes earn 
whatever they can.
But he made one point crystal 
clear: “I sure as hell don’t think 
it’s politicians’ job 
to get involved in 
this.”
Whose 
job 
it 
actually is will be 
litigated to death 
in 
the 
coming 
years. With many 
institutions seeking 
to weigh in on the 
hot button issue, 
don’t think you’ve 
heard the last of 
college players being compensated 
for their likeness. California’s 
new law is just the beginning 
with similar legislation being 
introduced across the country, and 
among all the confusion, one thing 
is clear – college athletics are about 
to change forever.

Michigan goalies focusing on mental readiness

Hayden 
Lavigne 
crouched 
between the posts, knees bent, 
head up and readied himself for the 
oncoming shots. 
Down the ice, 200 feet away, 
Strauss Mann mirrored a similar 
stance. 
And somewhere in the middle, 
Jack Leavy, the third goaltender, 
stood, awaiting the signal to switch 
with Lavigne or Mann.
Then it happened.
Lavigne raised his hand, and 
Leavy headed towards him mid-
drill. As he reached the left post, 
a puck was shot at Lavigne. With 
Lavigne guarding the right post 
and Leavy on the left, the two 
goalies came up with a save. Then 
Leavy took over for the remainder 
of the drill — a seamless transition.
It was an example of the type of 
synergy and ability they lacked all 
last year.
Looking at the goaltending stats 
from last season, the numbers don’t 
lie. There’s nowhere to hide. Mann 
and Lavigne struggled. Out of the 
60 teams playing NCAA Division 
I hockey, Michigan finished 59th 
in goaltending. It finished the year 
with 13-16-7 record.
New goalie coach Kris Mayotte 
knows this season has to be 
different. 
“I think they’d be the first ones 
to tell you that it has to improve,” 
Mayotte said. “But I think from 
what I’ve spoken with them about, 
and from what I’ve heard, they 
went into this last offseason with 
that mindset and that goal that 
they could come in this year and 
improve on that. I think their work 
ethic has been really good, their 
attention to detail has been good 
and their desire to improve.”
From the end of last season to 
now, the coaching staff has been 
watching, observing and taking 
notes all in an effort to answer the 
question that haunted Michigan 
last season — who will be the 
starting goaltender?
Despite the efforts, there are still 
kinks to be worked out. Mayotte 
spent the last month working to 
break any bad summer habits the 
three might have developed. 
One of the biggest shifts between 

summer and season training is the 
focus required. In the summer, 
goaltenders face multiple shots 
back-to-back, sometimes all from 
the same spot one player after 
another. But in the game, there’s 
only one puck to focus on. 
Mayotte 
matches 
the 
enthusiasm of Mann and Lavigne. 
Prior to arriving in Ann Arbor, he 
reached out to introduce himself 
and begin forming the important 
bond between players and coaches. 
The day of his first practice as 
goalie coach, he wasted no time. 
Two words broke apart the 
huddle 
signaling 
the 
end 
of 
practice: “Go Blue.” 
Slapping their sticks against 
the ice, the players skated for the 
locker room. But the goalies, upon 
changing, headed straight for 
Mayotte’s office to review film. 
“Having him not be shy at all and 
jump right in to giving us advice 
right away has been a good way to 
just start the season,” Lavigne said. 
“To make the most of these limited 
practice hours that we’ve had. He’s 
done a good job of just acclimating 
real quick and getting us adjusted 
to his new coaching style real fast.”
For Lavigne, the biggest obstacle 
between him and the starting spot, 
is his mental game. 
A disappointing performance 
in net and a lack of consistency 
knocked his confidence last year. 
During the 2017-18 season, Lavigne 
was in net for the Wolverines 
throughout their Frozen Four 
run. But last year, the goaltending 

he displayed during that run was 
nowhere to be found. He ended the 
season with a losing record, going 
7-8-3 with an .883 save percentage 
and a 3.16 goals averaged against. 
Lavigne’s mental struggle was 
so taxing that he couldn’t work 
much on the technical side of his 
goaltending like he wanted.
“Last year obviously was a tough 
one for me,” Lavigne said. “But I 
think I learned a lot out of it from 
the mental side of things and how 
to handle certain situations. How 
to hold myself accountable and the 
things that I wanna do that I didn’t 
do very well last year. So it was a 
good learning stone from there.”
Statistically, Mann didn’t fare 
much better. He posted a 6-8-4 
record, though slightly edged out 
Lavigne with a .895 save percentage 
and a 2.91 GAA. 
Strauss’ obstacle is identical to 
Lavigne’s. Throughout the summer, 
he emphasized the importance 
of getting in the right headspace 
following a tough season. 
Mentally, he emphasized just 
playing and staying relaxed rather 
than overthinking every save. 
Once things clicked, he focused 
on staying loose to allow for more 
explosiveness out of his set up and 
fundamentals.
Because being mentally strong 
is such a crucial part of being 
a goaltender — almost more 
important 
than 
the 
physical 
strength in the eyes of Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson. 
Goaltenders have a variety of 

resources available to them. During 
talks between the netminders and 
coaching staff, coaches stress the 
importance of attitude, preparation 
and focus on things that can be 
controlled rather than what can’t. 
A 
confidence 
boost 
came 
Lavigne’s way on Monday when the 
Big Ten Coaches Poll was released 
and his name was on the list of 
honorable mentions.
“That’s a huge honor,” Lavigne 
said. “After not coming off a great 
season last year, it still means that 
the coaches and the people that 
participate in that poll still see what 
I’m capable of.”
Even now with both goaltenders 
mentally strong, the question of 
who will be Michigan’s starting 
goaltender is no closer to being 
answered. The exhibition match 
Sunday offers a chance for some 
clarity. Pearson wants both players 
to have an opportunity to show 
what they’re capable of and how far 
they’ve come. 
“They’re both going to get an 
opportunity in the first game,” 
Pearson said. “They’ll both play 
some minutes, and we’ll just go 
from there. A lot of it’s based even 
on just how they do there. 
“You take it week by week right 
now especially early in the season 
because they both haven’t played 
for so long. You just hope one of 
them’s ready to go, if not both of 
them. I’d like to see both of them 
really have a great competition 
and make it hard on the coaches to 
decide who’s gonna play.”

Hailey Borja leads ‘M’ 
in Windy City Classic

Golf has its ups and downs. It 
can have its beautiful drives down 
the middle of the fairway or its 
wayward shots deep into the abyss 
of the rough. 
It’s a patient game, and the 
Michigan women’s golf team 
stayed the course at the Windy City 
Classic on Monday and Tuesday 
in Golf, Ill. The 
Wolverines 
struggled 
during the first 
round 
of 
play, 
but 
eventually 
finished 
strong 
in the second day 
placing 14th out 
of 15 teams
In a field full 
of schools ranked 
in the Top 25 
according to the 
Women’s Golf Coach’s Association, 
Michigan coach Jan Dowling 
knew it was going to be a test of her 
team’s determination. 
“It was a heck of a test for us 
and a heck of an opportunity,” 
Dowling said. “We had a solid 
round (Tuesday) but I think the 
first round Monday got us into a 
pretty big hole, 
so that part was 
unfortunate but 
I think it clears 
up what we need 
to 
do 
moving 
forward.”
After 
play 
ended 
on 
Monday, 
Michigan 
sat 
in 
15th 
place 
with a score of 
605 
(plus-29). 
Freshman Hailey Borja led the 
team in just her second career start 
as a Wolverine, sitting tied for 23rd 
going into the second day of play. 
Borja tied for 19th place when 
the dust settled, shooting a 217 
(plus-1). Dowling had nothing 
but praise for the freshman 
golfer, whose finish gives her two 
consecutive top-20 finishes early 

in the season. 
“She’s one of the steadiest 
golfers I’ve been around and I 
think that will bode well for her 
moving forward throughout her 
career,” Dowling said. “She should 
be pretty thrilled with her top-20 
finish but I know she thinks she 
could do even better.” 
Following 
Borja 
were 
sophomores 
Ashley 
Lau 
and 
Sophia 
Trombetta, 
who 
shot 
respective scores 
of 226 (plus-10) 
and 227 (plus-
11). 
Trombetta 
had 
a 
stellar 
final 
round, 
finishing 
out 
with a 71(minus-
1), which made 
her 
the 
only 
Wolverine to hit 
under par for the 
tournament. 
The results of 
the Windy City Classic aren’t the 
only results that matter for the 
Wolverines, though. 
Three 
players 
played 
as 
individuals at Eastern Michigan 
University in the Shirley Spork 
Invitational 
on

‘Maniac’ Daxton Hill turning heads

Daxton Hill was a highly-
touted 
recruit 
coming 
into 
Michigan. 
A 
five-star 
safety who flipped from the 
Wolverines to Alabama and 
then back again, there were 
talks 
that 
Hill 
could 
get 
significant playing time, or 
even start immediately. But 
before the season even started, 
coaches put a damper on his 
hype.
Jim Harbaugh said at a 
preseason 
press 
conference 
that the freshman safety would 
mostly 
play 
special 
teams. 
Safeties 
and 
special 
teams 
coach Chris Partridge said he 
was the fourth safety, behind 
not only senior Josh Metellus 
and junior Brad Hawkins, but 
also junior J’Marick Woods. 
The coaches stuck to their 
words, and on the field, Hill 
was quiet through the early 
goings of the season.
Until Saturday.
As a gunner on the punt 
coverage team, Hill flew down 
the field after Will Hart’s 
kick. Avery Young, the Rutgers 
returner, fielded the ball, then 
suddenly, Hill tackled him and 
pinned him to the ground.
Young 
likely 
didn’t 
know what hit him. But the 
Wolverines did.
“He’s the fastest guy on 
kickoff, on punt,” Partridge 
said Wednesday. “He’s maybe 
the fastest guy on the team.”
Two weeks ago, at Wisconsin, 
Hill looked tentative on punt 
coverage, hesitating when he 
should have hit the gas. But he 
knew the mistakes he’d made 
and worked hard to fix them.
It may have been that one hit 
on special teams that propelled 
him back into the spotlight, 
but behind the scenes, he’d 
already laid the foundations for 
a breakout game.
“(He) 
practices 
like 
a 
maniac 
and 
really, 
really 
takes coaching,” said assistant 

special teams coordinator Jay 
Harbaugh. “So when you watch 
a game — like the week before, 
there was a couple plays he 
didn’t make, and then the next 
week, and he makes them, it’s 
really cool.”
Hill also saw time at safety 
Saturday, picking up four total 
tackles. Sure, the opportunity 
came partially because Woods 
was out with an undisclosed 
injury, but Partridge admitted 
himself that they wouldn’t have 
put Hill in the game if they 
didn’t think he was ready.
There 
are 
still 
some 
improvements 
Hill 
has 
to 
make, like learning when you 
can run at full speed to hit 
someone and when you can’t 
and how to adjust to motion. 
But by all indications, he’s been 
progressing in those areas.
“Dax has been practicing 
hard each week, he’s just been 
getting better,” said senior 
cornerback Lavert Hill. “His 
mind’s starting to slow down, 
and he’s just getting a feel for 
the games so it’s definitely a big 
jump in the past couple weeks.”
Both Jim Harbaugh and 
Partridge want to get Hill more 
playing time, but like with 
most freshmen looking to work 
their way into the rotation, 
there’s a dichotomy. If Hill gets 
significant minutes this early, 
it’s probably because one of his 

more experienced teammates 
isn’t playing well, something no 
coach wants.
So while Hill will probably 
stay the fourth safety for now, 
he’s impressed enough that he 
could still carve out a niche on 
defense. 
Partridge 
preaches 
playing to everyone’s strengths 
with as much depth at the 
position as the Wolverines 
have, and against the Scarlet 
Knights, Hill frequently came 
out on third-down packages 
because of his speed.
“He’s a great cover guy,” 
Partridge said. “He’s got elite 
coverage skills. His thing is 
just making sure we’re training 
his eyes and he understands 
what route combinations could 
possibly coming based on who 
he’s defending, splits, all that 
stuff, but he’s getting there.”
Of course, one game against 
Rutgers isn’t going to suddenly 
rocket Hill up the depth chart, 
but his hype train has regained 
steam, and for good reason. 
Especially with Woods still 
questionable, Hill has emerged 
as a reliable backup option in 
the secondary, and one with 
upside, to boot.
To see that upside, all you 
need to do is watch again as 
Dax Hill flies into the Scarlet 
Knights’ punt returner and 
waves his fingers afterward, as 
if making an introduction.

Wolverines finding balance at RB

Among 
the 
confounding 
trends from Michigan’s first four 
games, one stands out.
In week two against Army, 
freshman running back Zach 
Charbonnet ascended into the 
spotlight, rushing 33 times for 
100 yards and three touchdowns.
In the Wolverines’ two games 
since, Charbonnet — “limited” 
by injury, according to Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh — has seven 
carries. Sophomores Christian 
Turner and Hassan Haskins 
have 17 and 10, respectively. 
Senior Tru Wilson, in his return 
from a broken hand, joined the 
mix with four carries against 
Rutgers on Saturday.
Confusing, right? Turns out, 
that’s just how Michigan wants 
it.
“I liked the fact that you can 
split it up, maybe 20, 20, 20, 
maybe a few for a fourth guy,” 
Harbaugh said. “But Zach played 
really well. Christian Turner 
played really well in this game, 
had some really fine runs. And 
Hassan Haskins really played 
well.”
Look 
past 
Harbaugh 
suggesting the Wolverines run 
the ball 60-plus times in a game 
— even in a run-heavy game-
script against Rutgers, they ran 
41 times — and you’ll see what he 

wants this running back group 
to be.
Charbonnet, as talented as he 
is, isn’t supposed to run the ball 
33 times. “It’s just kinda common 
sense,” said running backs coach 
Jay Harbaugh. “As a running 
back, you don’t want that. But 
there’s times in a game where 
you can get in a situation where 
it’s a little bit 
unavoidable.”
The 
key 
to 
avoiding 
those 
situations 
lies 
in 
establishing 
depth at running 
back — something 
Michigan didn’t 
anticipate 
struggling 
with before the 
season.
Then, 
less 
than 
halfway 
into the season opener, Wilson 
broke his hand on a blitz pickup. 
Turner has struggled with poor 
pass protection. Behind them, 
Haskins and sophomore Ben 
VanSumeren — fourth and fifth 
on the preseason depth chart, 
according to Jay Harbaugh — 
weren’t quite ready yet.
Now? 
Saturday’s 
carry 
distribution says it all.
“Those guys really just (got) 
back to work,” Jay Harbaugh 
said. “There were certain things 
that they needed to focus on and 
get more mental reps, actual 

physical reps, making sure that 
they’re ready to see in the game.
“I think a lot of it’s just the 
nature of young, inexperienced 
players 
that’s 
it 
sometimes 
happens like that. None of those 
guys have played very many 
snaps in live action so it probably 
is a little less surprising to us 
than maybe it is to the outside 
that something like that can 
happen.”
While Jim Harbaugh didn’t 
explicitly announce who his 
top three backs were when he 
called for a three-way split, the 
indication soon became obvious. 
Charbonnet and Turner were 
givens and Harbaugh’s next two 
sentences were, in fact, about 
those backs.
The third spot, though, left 
some 
momentary 
intrigue. 
Haskins got nine carries against 
Rutgers, but that was the first 
game back for Wilson, part of the 
top trio before the season.
Then, Harbaugh answered 
the question he himself had 
prompted.
“Hassan 
Haskins 
really 
played 
well,” 
Harbaugh 
said 
“We’re watching 
Hassan 
now 
really 
make 
great 
strides 
in 
practice, 
see 
him 
play 
that well in the 
game. There are 
some examples of him dropping 
his hips and getting through 
the hole like some of the really 
special backs can do. So, redshirt 
freshman Hassan Haskins has 
really come on.”
According to Jay Harbaugh, 
the keys for Haskins to establish 
his playing time were to fall 
forward at the end of runs and 
improve his blitz pickups. “All 
that is kind of the vision we had 
for him, which is great,” he said 
Wednesday.
Now, 
the 
vision 
for 
the 
running back room as a whole is 
starting to fall in place with it.

Notebook: What you need to know from Media Day with Juwan Howard

ROSEMONT, Ill. — During 
the 2009 NBA season, a thought 
crawled into Juwan Howard’s head. 
Coaching.
As a member of the Portland 
Trail Blazers, he watched head 
coach Nate McMillan in action, and 
his interest was piqued. It was just 
a seed at the time, but eventually 
it sprouted into something bigger 
than he could imagine.
A decade later, he found himself 
behind the podium at Big Ten 
Media Day, donning a Michigan 
pin on the lapel of his sport coat. 

Between his realization in Portland 
and Wednesday morning, he won 
two NBA titles alongside LeBron 
James and Dwyane Wade and 
spent five seasons as an assistant to 
Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra. 
His convoluted journey back to Ann 
Arbor ended with an emotional 
press conference at the end of May, 
where he shed tears on the Crisler 
Center floor.
The Daily breaks down what the 
Wolverines’ first-year head coach 
had to say.
Lofty expectations for prized 
freshman Franz Wagner
Juwan Howard’s first win on 
the recruiting trail came across the 

pond, where he landed German 
wing Franz Wagner — younger 
brother of former Michigan star 
Moritz Wagner — in July. But it 
didn’t come at the behest of a college 
blue blood. Instead, Howard lured 
Wagner away from Alba Berlin, his 
pro German club.
With Wagner now spending 
at least a season in Ann Arbor, 
Howard has no intentions of 
coddling the freshman. He’s ready 
to see the floor from the start, and 
his ability to make an impact on 
offense should help compensate 
for the departures of Jordan Poole, 
Ignas 
Brazdeikis 
and 
Charles 
Matthews — a trio that accounted 
for the majority of the Wolverines’ 
offense last season. Wagner and 
junior wing Isaiah Livers’ ability 
to create their own offense could 
be what Michigan turns to if the 
offense stalls.
“Franz is talented,” Howard said. 
“Franz is a big, huge pickup for us. 
In my opinion, if Franz lived in the 
U.S. he’d be the equivalent of what 
today’s players are rated five-star 
— he’s that good. And to be almost 
6-foot-9 at a wing position, he has a 
high IQ. He’s tough, he’s skilled. He 
can put the ball on the floor, create 
his own shot, and he’s not afraid to 
dunk on you.

“One thing I did not mention 
which I should’ve mentioned first 
was he’s an underrated defender. 
We all talk about his skill level 
offensively, but the guy can defend. 
He wants to defend, and that’s the 
beauty of Franz. He’s going to be a 
pro.”
Clean slate for Brandon Johns
Despite being the Wolverines’ 
second-highest ranked recruit last 
fall, Brandon Johns couldn’t earn 
regular minutes under John Beilein. 
With a year of college experience 
now under his belt, Johns will see 
an increased role under Howard.
In Johns, Howard sees all the 
tools. As a former NBA All-Star 
who worked closely with big men 
like Hassan Whiteside and Bam 
Adebayo in Miami, Howard knows 
what it takes.
“(Johns) has a beautiful shot, 
(he’s) 
athletic 
(and) 
skill-wise 
he still hasn’t tapped all the way 
into what he has,” Howard said. 
“Once he figures that part out? 
Woah, this kid’s interesting. And 
that’s the beauty of working with 
Brandon and many others like 
Brandon, when I talk to them at the 
beginning of practice — great eye 
contact, trust, you can see I want 
him and I’m going to do whatever I 
can to help him get better.

“He knows he has an opportunity 
to play. We’re going to lean on him, 
he can be one of those stretch fours 
that can be able to guard a ‘2,’ ‘3,’ ‘4’ 
and ‘5.’ Now it’s basically picking 
up the concepts and learning the 
terminology. He’s going to be good.”
After averaging just 4.2 minutes 
per game across 28 appearances at 
the ‘5’ last season, Johns’ ability to 
take a stride forward could very 
well hinge on his confidence. As 
a natural power forward with 
defensive versatility, Johns looked 
uncomfortable playing the role of 
small-ball center last year. Despite 
his difficulty adjusting, he remained 
boxed in because few minutes were 
available at the ‘4.’
In 
Howard’s 
positionless 
basketball 
philosophy, 
he’s 
crossing the confidence bridge by 
challenging Johns with competitive 
practice matchups.
“I’m going to keep working 
with 
(Johns), 
developing 
him 
and breathing more and more 
confidence in him,” Howard said. 
“ … He’s very interesting. Playing 
against 
a 
Franz 
everyday 
in 
practice, competing against Isaiah 
Livers — that’s just going to help his 
skill level rise even more. They’re 
challenging 
one 
another 
each 
and every day in practice, and I’m 

making sure of that.”
High praise for Eli Brooks’ 
‘basketball mind’
Since 
relinquishing 
starting 
point duties to now-senior Zavier 
Simpson in his freshman year, 
junior 
guard 
Eli 
Brooks 
has 
assumed a pivotal bench role. His 
high IQ, quick first step and ability 
to lead a fast break earned him 
playing time in each of Michigan’s 
37 games last season. He averaged 
13 minutes per game, averaging 2.5 
points and 1.1 assists per game.
Now an upperclassman, Brooks 
can ease the Wolverines’ offensive 
struggles by igniting fast breaks that 
result in easy points. His quickness 
and decision-making in transition 
could ultimately determine how 
much playing time he sees.
“(Brooks) gets it,” Howard said. 
“He has a basketball mind — he 
picks things up so quick, you only 
have to tell him one time. His IQ in 
transition, he can apply it quickly.
“He’s super crafty with the 
basketball, getting to the paint, 
whether 
he’s 
making 
a 
play 
for himself or for others. He’s 
competitive. Some would say he’s 
undersized, but I think that’s what 
really makes him edgy because he’s 
counted as small at his position. I 
look at Eli as a combo guard.”

Bookstores are more than just retail shops — they are sacred spaces where 
profound ideas meet curious thinkers. When I walk into a local bookstore, I’m 
overwhelmed and excited by the endless shelves full of new stories and ideas. 
I’ve discovered some of my favorite books in local bookshops and often peruse 
them when trying to decide my next read.
Independent booksellers have spent years trying to keep their businesses 
afloat with the rise of chain bookstores, and local owners are now facing new 
challenges as more readers are turning to Amazon or e-readers to satisfy their 
literary appetites. Most readers choose these digital alternatives for ease, 
but in doing so sacrifice the ambience and community of their local 
bookshops. Despite these obstacles, Ann Arbor is still home to a varieaty 
of independent bookstores that continue to serve the local community.
Dawn Treader, one of the oldest bookshops in downtown Ann Arbor, 
has been selling used books since 1979. While its exterior gives off the 
impression of a quaint, nook-sized shop, a walk through the store will 
take longer than you might think. With its winding, maze-like aisles 
filled top to bottom with books, you can find anything from your long-
forgotten childhood series to your most recent favorites. Dawn Treader 
is a time capsule, offering some rare and valuable finds if you’re willing 
to embrace the hunt.
Another integral member of the Ann Arbor literary scene is Crazy 
Wisdom, a spiritual bookshop that also doubles as a tea room. The 
shop offers more than 14,000 books and is largely centered around 
naturalistic and alternative spiritual practices. Upon entering the 
shop, customers are immediately immersed in the ambience of Crazy 
Wisdom: a faint smell of incense and sound of live acoustic music performed 
over the noise of brewing tea. The store opened in 1982 and still serves the 
Ann Arbor community with events and their community journal featuring 
local writers. They’re also the only local bookstore offering a specific, holistic 
approach, making organic living more available to the local community. 
Although its a far walk for students living on campus, eager visitors still wait 
at the doors until the shop opens at noon, welcoming customers into their 
natural, serene atmosphere. 
One of the newest bookstores in town, Literati, has already seen great 
success in the six years they’ve been operating. They’ve earned the 2019 title 
of “Bookstore of the Year” by Publishers Weekly and published a book, “Notes 
From a Public Typewriter,” which includes blurbs from customers who’ve 
left notes on the shop’s typewriter. Unlike Dawn Treader or Crazy Wisdom, 
Literati possesses a more modern feel while still maintaining the coziness of a 
traditional bookshop. The wooden floors softly creak as customers stroll past 
the shelves of colorful titles, and hidden among the large array of books are 
handwritten staff reviews of favorite books in each section. 

Literati’s welcoming atmosphere extends beyond its physical attributes: the 
locally owned shop also gets the community involved in reading with author 
visits, book clubs and writing workshops. One of their goals as a business is to 
give to local charities, schools and nonprofits while also creating well-paying 
jobs for local employees. 
Although these local businesses are loved and cherished by students and 
Ann Arbor residents, their success relies heavily on the dedication of the 
community to their missions. For these local booksellers, the future of their 
businesses can seem uncertain as more people gravitate towards quick and 
easy means of obtaining their reading materials. The responsibility relies on 
us, the consumers, to support our community booksellers and boost the local 
economy. 
Stopping by a local bookstore, whether to purchase an assigned reading or 
simply take a look at what the shop has to offer, is participation in a sense of 
community that an online purchase just can’t replicate. A special uniting factor 
exists within a bookshop, one that sparks conversation among strangers and 
draws people in from all backgrounds and experiences. There’s a very specific 

kind of fiery passion felt from reader to reader, and while it’s hard to put a name 
to, it’s a feeling understood by all bookstore-goers. Even though the future of 
online bookstores and e-books looms overhead, there’s a stronger element of 
community found amidst the uncertainty of paper, and this collective hope 
will be enough to sustain our beloved bookshops.

I first fell in love with bookstores at age seven in a Barnes and Noble. In our 
dingy Monmouth County New Jersey mall, we have — at least, for a seven year 
old — a kingdom-sized Barnes and Noble. My mother would often have to lay 
out ground rules before we went inside when I was little: Only one hour, no 
straying too far into the YA section before you turn ten, you’re allotted three 
books or whatever $50 can get you. These rules and those rainy Sundays 
in Barnes and Noble made me fall in love with physical copies of books — 
holding them, paging through them and, most importantly (and perhaps most 
strangely), smelling them. 
Going to a new place for me always means visiting a new bookstore. Every 
good town has a good independent bookstore. It is the beating heart in the 

center of a place, it is the community gathering spot, it is the lifeline to which 
towns operate and thrive. I have hunted down the bookstore in every single 
place I have ever visited. It’s because I deeply care about paper. It’s because 
I deeply care about stories. It’s because with my tiny contribution to an 
independent bookstore, I can ensure that I’m supporting a concerted effort to 
keep print alive. To keep books alive. When the Kindle and Nook fad began, 
I was devastated. I understand the comfort and ease with which we can tote 
around our electronic devices, but what about the romance and the infatuation 
that comes along with annotating the margins of a worn copy of your favorite 
novel? Or reading and rereading a paragraph of an excellent short story, flipping 
back and forth through the same pages? 
The first independent bookstore I can remember falling in love with is in 
Manchester, Vermont. It is called Northshire Books and is the only reason I will 
ever go on a ski trip with my family. The promise of this bookstore, about three 
stories high, with an appropriately placed coffee bar and the most genuine 
booksellers I’ve ever met, make the six-hour drive north worth it. It was here 
I completed my collection of all the “Harry Potter” books and purchased my 
first ever collection of R.H. Sin poetry. 
When I visited Ann Arbor for my first time, my father bought me a 
classic bound Walt Whitman book at Literati before I’d even been there. 
He was wandering downtown by himself while I was on a tour, and I 
remember how excited he was to take me there and watch me discover 
Literati myself when the tour was over. Four years later, whenever I’m 
having a bad day or something difficult happens to me, I go to Literati. 
It has become the cavern of words and stories that soothes and coaxes 
my worst of days. I’ve been there so often that sometimes my past self 
leaves a surprise for my future self with the store credit that racks up 
from every purchase I make. I’d also like to disclose that the coffee at 
Literati is the best coffee in Ann Arbor. 
My house is on River Road in Fair Haven, New Jersey. Half a mile 
walk up River Road is one of my favorite places in the world: River 
Road Books. It’s the place that instilled in me the love for independent 
bookstores and booksellers. I spent a great deal of weekends in my 
childhood leaning up against the counter asking the booksellers, women from 
my tiny one square mile hometown, to recommend me books. 
After my sophomore year of college, I moved to St. Louis by myself for an 
internship. I knew nobody in Missouri and was incredibly lonely. When I 
needed someone and nobody was there, Left Bank Books was there. I rode my 
bike to the corner bookstore at least twice a week, and next to it was a Jeni’s, 
meaning I always left with words and ice cream. 
Recently, I took my mother to Crazy Wisdom for the first time. We were 
standing in the first floor and I was going on and on about a book display that 
featured a few new releases I’d recently read and adored. I was also gushing 
over the gluten free treats in their tea room up the stairs. She looked at me 
and said, “I don’t know, something in me thinks you’ll aspire to opening your 
own bookstore.” I thought about it for a second: How simple yet how happy 
I’d be with my very own bookstore where I’d turn on the lights every morning, 
prescribe people books all day, and lock up at night. It’s because I care about 
stories. It’s because I care about words.

The sound of a love letter
You know you love someone when you can write them a love letter and 
the words flow like a waterfall, feeling by feeling, an unrelenting avalanche 
of emotion for another. But life moves fast. Things happen so rapidly, so 
haphazardly, it’s hard to pin your feelings for others. Family, friends, lovers 
and exes, people who 
have brought us joy and 
drama, pleasure and pain. 
That ambiguous emotion 
in your stomach, is it 
love, hate, passion, fury, 
infatuation or worry?
If your love has no 
words, make them a 
playlist.
I have maybe-feelings 
for a maybe-someone, 
and their maybe-love-
letter is “Sweet To Me” by 
Summer Salt, “Dancing 
Queen” by ABBA, “I 
Wanna Dance With Somebody” by Whitney Houston. Then there’s the 
one it was never going to work out with, who made me feel “Saw You In A 
Dream” by The Japanese House, “I Feel For You” by Chaka Khan, “Feel Like 
A Fool” by Kali Uchis. But it’s not always a romantic love letter that music can 
embody. There’s platonic love for my best friend, who I would tell the dumb 
excitement we share is encapsulated by “BOOGIE” by BROCKHAMPTON, 
“Let’s Go Crazy” by Prince, “Superheroes” by Daft Punk. And for my family, 
a love letter that only they would understand: “Friday” by Rebecca Black, 
“Don’t Stop Believin” by Journey, “P.I.M.P.” by 50 Cent.
The songs just fall into place. It’s the sequence that so perfectly mirrors 
the wavelength of your heart.
Music evokes emotion, sometimes emotion more romantic than the 
classic written words of love on paper. To say, “You make me feel the way 
this song makes me feel” can be the most heartfelt sentiment (if the song 
is right). It can be a hard copy — a series of songs burned onto a CD, the 
titles scribbled on the disc in magic marker. Or it could be digital, a Spotify 
link at the end of a sweet text. All that matters is the music, the rhythm, 
the harmony and the pitch can capture the way that person makes you feel.
The love letter looks different for every writer, the songs that compose 
it different for every recipient. There are no words that can capture the 
writer’s feelings for everyone or that evoke all recipients’ feelings the same. 
A playlist to me with “Come On Eileen” by Dexys Midnight Runners on 
it means something different to me if it comes from my childhood friend 
instead of my mom. A playlist from me with “I Write Sins Not Tragedies” by 
Panic At The Disco on it means something different to my cousin than it does 
to my first girlfriend. The music on a playlist — the words in a love letter — 
are unique for sender and receiver, an intimate covenant of understanding.
A playlist may not seem like a direct way to communicate love. But that’s 
only true from the outside looking in, for a playlist without the context of 
sender and receiver. For two people that share something — memories, 
experiences, a connection — the message in the music is all too clear. Music 
has a long history of millions and millions of songs. There’s no end to the 
precision with which to show warmth and fondness. Somewhere, on a 
record on a shelf at the back of the thrift store, in a cassette at the bottom of 
a box in the basement, on a still-kind-of-working iPod Shuffle in the closet, 
there are the songs that make your love letter.

Dear reader(s), 
‘Tis the season of love! No, Valentine’s Day is still a ways away. Yes, 
“spooky season” doesn’t exactly spell romance. As for the cold weather 
“cuffing season,” there’s still time to prepare for cozy hibernation (although 
I would argue that the in-between of summer flings and relationship-
damning family holidays is the perfect time to find someone to shack up 
with). Despite this, this is the season of love not because capitalism or dead 
saints has deemed it so, but because any day is a good day for love. 
And what screams love better than a love letter? Nothing. Except, maybe, 
a playlist of musical love letters. That’s right, here at the Daily, the perfect 
playlist of love letters has been handcrafted for your enjoyment. Whether 
it’s good, old-fashioned romance, platonic friendship or even a dose of self-
appreciation (Hot Girl Fall, anyone?), this playlist has all the bases covered. 
ABBA and Patsy Cline bring on the girl-power self-love with tracks like 
“Dancing Queen” and “Walkin’ After Midnight.” Both tracks celebrate 
finding yourself amidst the crowd; ABBA as an open letter to every dancing 
queen out there, and 
Patsy as an introspective 
serenade for her own 
lonely march down the 
road, 
“Searchin’ 
for 
me.” Elvis, Fats Waller, 
and The Black Crows 
(to name a few) add a 
traditional spin with their 
more literal love letters, 
thematically focusing on 
mourning lost love and 
lyrically 
recalling 
the 
format of a love letter. 
Edith Pilaf’s “La Vie en 
Rose,” Albert Hammond’s 
“It Never Rains in Southern California” and Atta Boy’s “Walden Pond” all 
focus on a passionate love for life, regardless of the trials and tribulations. 
This playlists balances the old with some touches of the contemporary (but 
the Oldies are Goodies) and captures the many sides of love. 
No matter the decade, the genre or the artist, love can be found anywhere 
and everywhere. Indulge in some lovin’ (in a loveshack, if you can) and some 
plain, good music this week. 
Signed with love, 
[Return to Sender]
The Black Crows, “Girl From a 
Pawnshop”
Fats Waller, “Sit Right Down [and 
write myself a letter]”
Patsy 
Cline, 
“Walkin’ 
After 
Midnight”
ABBA, “Dancing Queen”
Edith Pilaf, “La Vie En Rose”
Atta Boy, “Walden Pond”
Elvis, “Return to Sender”
Shirelles, “Please Mr. Postman”
Vera Lynn, “We’ll Meet Again”
Albert Hammond, “It Never Rains 
in Southern California”
Bob Dylan, “You’re Gonna Make 
Me Lonesome When You Go”
Bon Iver, “For Emma”
Penny and the Quarters, “You and 
Me”

This is an abridged history of 
songs I consider(ed) love letters
in approximately three parts. Part 
One: male songwriters who didn’t 
sound misogynistic. In eleventh 
grade, I wrote an essay about 

men who “get it.” A significant portion was about The Killers and how 
understood I felt by the lyrics of “When You Were Young,” but in retrospect, 
I don’t think it still registers as a love letter. I wanted it to be the love letter 
I would receive someday from a boy who “didn’t look a thing like Jesus, but 
talks like a gentleman,” like I imagined when I was young. 
Flash forward to my senior year English class. As some sort of introductory 
activity for what I imagine must have been a study of ballads, we were asked 
to produce love songs. I picked “Casimir Pulaski Day” by Sufjan Stevens. 
While my (hip) teacher, who knew the song, questioned my choice, I think 
it brings us to Part Two of the history: (still) male songwriters, but ones who 
actually get it. Stevens, Death Cab and Iron & Wine all lured me into a less 
prescriptive, idealized, biblical, impossible image of love — I owe them each 
love letters for that fact.
Big Thief single-handedly ushers us into Part Three, where you can write 
letters to people you love, not just people with whom you’re in love, and 
account for all the complexity that comes with that. “Mythological Beauty,” 
Big Thief’s moving love letter to a complicated mother figure, opened the 
floodgates. Love letters could be addressed to mothers, to hookups who 
meant more than you intended, to platonic best friends. Oh, and they didn’t 
have to be piano-based or acoustic anymore, either.
Love letters aren’t just for the unrequited love of your life. In fact, your 
mom probably deserves many, many more love letters than a classmate 
you’re unwisely crushing on. If you don’t believe me, listen for yourself.

This playlist is a collection of love letters. Some of the songs are literally 
structured as letters; some just function as such. I admit that some of them 
are a bit of a stretch if you’re going to be strict about what constitutes a love 
letter, but I tried to keep them epistolary to a certain extent: expressions of 
love addressed directly to the object of their affection. 
While “love letters” are typically assumed to be expressions of romantic 
love, those in the playlist encompass love in its many forms. From the 
generative, paternal “Welcome to Earth (Pollywog)” to the playful, platonic 
“A Postcard to Nina,” to the fragile yet roaring “When You Sleep,” this 
collection of songs is an hour-and-twenty-three-minute-long tribute to the 
range of emotions that love can comprise.

Thursday, October 3, 2019 — 3B

Does anyone else remember an online 
rumor that claimed Devon Werkheiser, 
most famous for playing Ned on “Ned’s 
Declassified School Survival Guide,” was 
6’ 3’’? No? Well I do, and turns out it’s 
false. He’s 5’ 9’’, and his voice has not 
gotten any deeper since 2007. And he wears 
neckerchiefs unironically now. What does 
this have to do with anything? Something! 
Because this week, we’re talking paper over 
at The Michigan Daily Arts section! And 
what is the most famous collection of paper 
on television? No, not Joel Osteen’s Bible 
— it’s Ned’s sick camouflage composition 
notebook.
Although I would have liked to bring 
you the kind of content you deserve today 
(Top 10 James “Cookie” Cook Moments 
or a deeper analysis into what the blonde 
basketball kid did for white players in the 
NBA), I must redirect to investigate. Why is 
“Ned’s Declassified School Survival Guide” 
impossible to find online? Of all of the 
shows to be pirated online, I thought that 
for sure “Ned’s” would be an easy find. It 
ran nearly two decades ago for three short 
seasons and never racked up that many Kids’ 
Choice Awards. It wasn’t a network darling 
like “iCarly” or “Spongebob Squarepants,” 
so I could not imagine why protecting its 
distribution online would be a top priority. 
But, after looking through almost every 
streaming platform and through several 
misleading YouTube playlists, I could only 
find the pilot episode on Dailymotion, the 
Yahoo of video-sharing websites.
In keeping with the theme, there’s just 
no paper trail. Get it? Please applaud me.
Hear me out on this, but I think 
Nickelodeon might be trying to bury 
the show. It wouldn’t be the first time 
they tried to wipe good shows from our 
memory. Remember “ChalkZone?” Your 
subconscious does.
“Ned’s 
Declassified 
School 
Survival 
Guide” was created by showrunner Scott 
Fellows, a man with a storied history at 
Nickelodeon. In addition to serving as the 
head writer on “The Fairly OddParents” 
for a number of years, he also created “Big 
Time Rush.” Direct your hate mail to him. 
I bring up the B-list boyband specifically 
because their show, in its entirety, is 
currently available on Hulu. “Big Time 
Rush” was never that successful before 
the dawn of One Direction, and especially 
not after, so I have to wonder, why did 
executives at Nickelodeon choose that 
show to be streamed and remembered and 
not the show that gave us Coconut Head 
and Backpack Boy? In a lot of ways the 
shows are very similar, despite one being 
about a boy-band of hockey players from 

Minnesota and the other following the 
everyday lives of middle schoolers. Both 
shows share the same farcical humor, 
and both shows’ rapid-fire sound effects 
contributed to my short attention span. So 
why the preference?
In a lot of ways the streaming world 
could benefit from a show like “Ned’s 
Declassified 
School 
Survival 
Guide.” 
Kids these days need substance, and Ned 
delivered good, clean fun that the whole 
family could enjoy. Maybe, just maybe, if 
Ned Bigby was available to Generation Z, 
TikTok wouldn’t be getting so big. Just a 
thought. If this reflection on paper has 
done anything for you, I hope it inspires 
you to write your local congressman and 
demand that “Ned’s Declassified School 
Survival Guide” be resurrected for online 
consumption.
P.S. Did you know Moze and Ned totally 
dated in real life?

Be brave enough to never
forget ‘Ned’s Declassified’

Paper can burn, but the feelings it gave us 
don’t turn to ash that easily. Honor true love by 
rejecting materialism — who needs diamonds 
anyway?

B-SIDE: TV NOTEBOOK

What is Paper Magazine? The simplistic covers 
leave everything to the imagination. There are no 
headlines, simply a celebrity’s brooding face and a title 
for the issue, and that’s it, that’s the cover. Given the 
industry convention of catchy titles hinting at how 
to have an orgasm, why does Paper still manage to 
capture our attention?
Obviously, the magazine’s covers grab attention, 
but beyond that, what makes them different from 
other 
fashion 
magazines? 
Among 
the 
typical 
coverage of celebrities and pop culture, the magazine 
has highlighted Colin Kaepernick’s “Know Your 
Rights Camp” in a series of 10 interviews curated by 
Kaepernick himself. Though the set of articles was 
released in August, the magazine still highlights all ten 
through a tab on their homepage. Rather than letting 
Kaepernick’s conversation lapse, like most outlets tend 
to do, Paper has made sure their readers are reminded 
of these issues every time they’re looking for the latest 
fashion trends.

Or maybe it’s the people behind the magazine that 
keep us hooked. Kim Hastreiter and Drew Elliott 
started the New York-based publication in 1984 and 
for the past 35 years it has managed to stay relevant. 
Hastreiter, according to a profile by The New York 
Times, is an editor like no other. She’s one of the most 
influential people in the city, but that doesn’t stop her 
from eating dinner with her intern, or whoever she 
senses might be the next big thing in art. She’s a flexible 
personality spanning all aspects of culture in the city, 
a persona that manifests itself in the magazine. But 
she’s not alone. Drew Elliott, her co-founder, was the 
one who wanted to create the Kim Kardashian cover 
that would eventually bring 50 million views to the 
website in one day. Elliott has been quoted as saying 
he’d sooner look at Disney than Vogue when looking 
for ways to expand the brand (a sharp observation, 
considering the media event that was Spider-Man 
having to leave the MCU this past summer).
Even as the magazine intends to remain cutting-
edge, Paper is still a fashion and contemporary media 
outlet. As such, coverage of Kylie Jenner’s latest illness 
and Bella Thorne’s new porn award are mixed in 
with West Coast artists exploring the importance of 
accepting our bodies. Striking this balance between 
the “pop” and “culture” of a pop culture publication 
is what sets Paper apart from magazines like 
Cosmopolitan or even Vogue. With a separate tab 
simply labeled “Art,” Paper doesn’t force its readers to 
sift through mounds of articles and graphics. Instead, 
it’s an easy grab straight from the homepage.
Whatever your thoughts are about Paper Magazine, 
there’s no doubt that the publication knows how to 
captivate an audience. From their enigmatic editors to 
a diverse level of content, the role Paper plays in the 
world of fashion is pivotal — it puts activists, celebrities 
and brand-new artists on the same level. Paper 
endeavors to tear down whatever arbitrary walls we 
encounter in most pop culture publications, instead 
opting to create a world where everyone is anyone and 
an assistant can rub elbows with the likes of Rihanna.

B-SIDE: STYLE NOTEBOOK

It is easy to view love as materialistic. A day 
meant to celebrate it is associated with outlandish 
gifts and gaudy chocolate boxes. The proposal 
that starts the rest of your life is linked forever to 
an expensive gem, and the wedding that proceeds 
that proposal can rack up a pretty hefty price tag. 
When romance is portrayed on TV or in movies, it is 
accompanied by expensive dinner dates with fading 
candle light or Tiffany boxes stuffed secretly in a 
loved one’s jacket pocket. Given all of this, it may 
seem to the cynical eye that the meaning of love 
is to buy, to indulge, to show off. Perhaps I am an 
optimist, but I believe it’s quite the opposite.
There is a long list of gifts that traditionally 
coincide with a wedding anniversary. The fifth year 
is wood, 10th is tin, 15th is crystal and so on. Among 
this list, there is one material that sticks out the 
most to me — paper. That is the medium suggested 
for a first anniversary wedding gift. Plain old, 
traditional paper. Upon further investigation, paper 
as a first anniversary present is meant to represent 
the fragility of the young relationship. Well, no 
offense to whatever Old English town crier declared 
that, but they made some glaring mistakes.
Who dares to suggest the first year is when the 
couple is at their most fragile? I would have to 
argue that it’s the fifth, when a routine has been 
established, or maybe the 20th, when the kids have 
moved away and there is nothing but empty silence 
to fill the house anymore. But the first? Waking up 
on my first-ever first anniversary was like being a 
child at Christmas again. In the time the Earth 
completed her long orbit around the sun, I had 
found my own source of warmth — nothing about 
it felt breakable.
Paper does not constitute fragility, but strength. 
Strength to put your feelings and thoughts down 
on a page. Strength to be vulnerable and to share 
that with someone else. It is inherently romantic. 
Whether it’s the way a new book smells the first 
time you crack the spine or the feeling of a new pen 
gliding over crisp parchment, there is love in every 
detail.
As I sit in my bedroom writing this piece, I am 
surrounded by little slips of adoration. Taped onto 
my wall above me are cards from someone I love 

— silly designs printed on folds that open to reveal 
affection scrawled in ballpoint pen. On my bedside 
table is an impromptu poem given to my mother 
about her children, written out by a typewriter. “No 
contract attached / Signed my name on your sweet 
bones / Vowed to love always.” To my side are rows 
of pictures. Moments frozen in time, printed on a 
glossy piece of paper to reflect on and remember. 
Posters of my favorite lyrics, a business card of a 
restaurant that reminds me of my grandparents, 
photostrips catching me at my most candid. I am 
surrounded by paper, and in turn, surrounded by 
love.
Will paper ever be eradicated? Maybe in 
production, but never in meaning. Paper connects 
us to loves lost and loves found and loves soon to 
be. I can hold in my hands the wedding invitation 
for my grandparents. I can flip through a scrapbook 
documenting my childhood. I can open a book 
yellowed with age and see the markings of a hundred 
that read it before me. So is paper really the most 
mediocre of materials? Is it really only a gift to give 
with someone you may not be with the next year? 
Paper can burn, but the feelings it gave us don’t 
turn to ash that easily. Honor true love by rejecting 
materialism — who needs diamonds anyway?

I love you, here’s some paper

“It’s one of those things that gets better with 
time. These books are passed between artists 
as gifts, and getting one from someone you 
look up to means that you’ve really made it.” 
Having been shown their work on a somewhat 
peculiar date with a somewhat immodest poet/
artist/editor person, my introduction to the 
couple and surrealist photography duo known 
as Pierre et Gilles was loaded to say the least. 
He ended up using the book in our conversation 
as a strategic means to an end, one that I sort 
of fell for, before succumbing to the moat of 
inebriation and overall failure to hoist myself 
back onto the drawbridge. With regret, I must 
inform that my self-important and multifaceted 
fantasy man is no longer in the picture. Despite 
that night’s tile placement in the collective 
mosaic of uneasy semi-romantic encounters, 
however, its memory holds a lot of water for 
me — it served as a keystone exposure to really 
great queer art. The kind that needs to be 
experienced in person, on a page.
Pierre Comoy and Gilles Blanchard are well 
into their fifth decade of doing what they do: 
marrying fashion photography, portraiture, 
painting and a sensibility steeped heavily in 
camp and magical realism to build worlds, 
concepts taken to the highest extreme, befitting 
whoever is in front of the camera. They have 
several photo books, the most recent of which 
celebrates their 40th anniversary and compiles 
some of the work they are most well known for. 
Their several magazine covers include Out, 
Numero and Fucking Young!. They’ve worked 
with models, muses, artists, friends and larger 
than life figures (a particular favorite is an over-
blossomed vignette of Marilyn Manson and 
Dita von Teese), all while manipulating each 
image to bend in line with their overarching 
viewpoint.
Pierre et Gilles create drama. They are 
immersive. They are jouissance distilled 
in an image, in a single expression that is 
at once complicated and crystal clear, then 
cast throughout like speckled debris. They 
democratize the Venus, an art historical 
trope that positions the depicted figure as an 
aesthetic celebration, in such a way that women 
are exalted and men become objects of desire. 
They are feminized. Hairy-chested masculinity 
is given its day in the sun, make no mistake, but 
the men in the photographs are not men in the 
traditional sense. Strength and gravitas are 
undermined by their placement on a dinner 
tray, while the feminine looks you in the eye, 
pulling you through the fourth wall as though 
the barrier is nothing but a flimsy partition. 
And then there’s the ambiguous soup of flesh 
that resides somewhere in between those two 
poles. Religious iconography, phallic weaponry, 
political affiliations, Greek mythology and 
other cultural cliches are mobilized to subvert 
the more implicit markers of identity. They give 
breathtaking scenes, each threaded with teases 
and a touch of humour, creating a space for the 
viewer to look into themselves without raising 
the stakes to those of life and death. It can be 

fun to look at, or it can be something else.
It doesn’t quite come alive through a 
computer screen. Not like it does in print. Even 
as a reproduction of the original work, most 
of which are expanded photographs painted 
over to achieve their full effect, the textural 
interplay, the vividness of some elements 
contrasting with the smooth grain of film, 
make sense. The feeling of immediacy that 
comes with holding a bound photo book or 
a magazine with nice, thick paper cannot be 
replicated, nor can the experience of being able 
to flip through one and get completely lost in 
it — coming back up for air with a perfectly 
coherent understanding of what the artists 
and everyone involved in its publication meant 
to communicate, even if that understanding is 
unique to you.
Print media has been “dying” for a long time, 
but in that death, or at least relegation to niche 
markets, there is a great deal of personal value 
placed on what we choose to fill our shelves 
with. In the information age and the apparent 
mass exodus of trees, the only things we can 
afford to keep around are those that move us, 
challenge us and inspire us to create and be 
better people. Pierre et Gilles, to me, is joy. Their 
work represents the ability to weave through 
the world with all of its weight and create 
something worth looking at. If homoerotic 
portraits of communists adorned with wreaths 
of red roses and crystal tears aren’t your thing, 
OK. I hear that. And yet the point remains. 
Regardless of what ill-fated endeavors lead to 
its discovery, when something that carries real 
weight makes itself known, it’s important to 
hold on to it.

This 
is 
it, 
the 
writing 
opportunity I’ve been waiting for 
my whole life: the chance to wax 
poetic about a Colin Firth movie. 
When asked to think about 
the representation of paper in 
film, the immediate thought that 
comes to mind for most romantic 
comedy fanatics is this scene 
from “Love Actually.” I know 
it did for me. If you’ve seen the 
movie, you’ll know exactly which 
scene I’m talking about. 
In the scene, Jamie (Colin 
Firth, “The King’s Speech”) is 
working diligently on his novel, 
which he tellingly chooses to 
write with a typewriter. Why 
use a typewriter? He could 
have easily used a laptop — 
2003 is not as ancient a time 
as we believe it to be. There is 
something inherently romantic 
about 
a 
typewriter, 
though, 
and people who use them are 
unquestionably engaging in a 
kind of performance when they 
do so. The use of a typewriter, 
or any method of writing that 
doesn’t involve a screen for that 
matter, 
implies 
seriousness, 
traditionalism and poise. Some 
may even call it pretentious, 

though I’m not sure I agree. 
Regardless, whatever kind of 
person Jamie presents himself 
as through his writing setup is 
instantly deconstructed when 
his finished pages are blown out 
of his grasp by the wind and into 
the dirty, freezing cold pond 
right behind his cottage. 
Jamie’s 
housekeeper, 
the 
Portuguese-speaking 
and 
beautiful Aurélia (Lúcia Moniz, 
“Red 
Nose 
Day 
Actually”), 
immediately strips down to her 
underwear and dives into the 
pond, believing she is saving 
something that might be of 
significant literary value. Jamie 
knows what he’s written is not 
worth getting into that water for, 
and is thus shocked by Aurélia’s 
commitment 
to 
the 
cause. 
Regardless of whatever value 
Jamie’s writing might have, it 
seems to be that trying to save 
it is a futile gesture — I imagine 
the ink-printed words on the 
page would bleed to the point 
of unreadability. But Aurélia 
doesn’t have time to think of 
these logistics: She jumps right 
in, and Jamie is clearly moved by 
her behavior, by how much she 
believes in him. He follows her 
into the water. 
Jamie and Aurélia engage 
in both a literal and figurative 

stripping of layers, taking off 
their cardigans and plunging 
into uncertain terrain. Their 
individual ways of going about 
this are brilliantly revealing of 
them as people — while Aurélia 
takes off nearly all of her clothing 
and dives into the pond as though 
she’s a professional swimmer, 
Jamie leaves on everything but 
his sweater and clumsily falls 
into the pond instead of jumping. 
She is confident and determined, 
he is insecure and apprehensive, 
and they’re just now learning this 
about each other. Having come 
to understand the pointlessness 
of trying to save the paper, they 
laugh, and the rest of their love 
story is history.
The 
paper 
itself 
means 
nothing, of course. What matters 
is what the paper represents, 
what the thing printed on its 
surface signifies. In the case of 
“Love Actually,” what’s printed 
on Jamie’s pages probably isn’t 
even what matters — after all, 
he even says, “It’s not worth it, 
it isn’t bloody Shakespeare.” 
What does matter about this 
paper is that its plunge into the 
pond’s murky waters is what 
drags Jamie and Aurélia into the 
pond, allowing their romance to 
advance to new and uncharted 
territories.

A dive into ‘Love Actually’

B-SIDE: STYLE NOTEBOOK

I used to despise journaling. 
Every 
summer 
throughout 
middle 
school, 
my 
parents 
required my sister and I to keep 
a journal, hoping to cultivate 
our writing skills and keep 
us sharp for the upcoming 
school year. No matter how 
many 
aesthetically-pleasing 
incentives presented to us — 
worn, leather-bound covered 
journals or neon jelly roll pens 
— I protested. Out of teenage 
spite, I sloppily composed my 
entries, triple and quadruple 
spacing my sentences to meet 
the minimum page requirement 
and scribbling in near-illegible 
scrawl. My vocabulary was 
bland and disjointed, detailing 
the 
most 
mundane 
daily 
activities I could conjure up, 
like “woke up at 8:32 a.m.” 
or “brushed my teeth for 46 
seconds.” 
Melodramatic 
and 
petty? Yes and yes. 
Once I reached high school, 
my 
parents 
loosened 
their 
summer requirements, and I 
gleefully vowed that I would 
never journal again.
Then something changed. It 
was the fall of my senior year 
and I was bumbling through the 

Common App and frantically 
completing last-minute college 
visits. Nestled on the plane en 
route to Washington University 
in St. Louis for an interview, my 
nerves were buzzing. Whether 
it was an introversion-induced 
terror or a need to proactively 
process my anxieties, I felt an 
unfamiliar impulse to write. As 
if by fate, I’d packed a “college 
journal” at my mother’s request 
to take notes and look engaged 
during 
the 
informational 
session 
and 
campus 
tour. 
Hesitantly, I pulled a pale 
blue book from my backpack, 
pinching it like an alien object. 
I awkwardly brushed the pages 
and aimed to focus my thoughts. 
Pen in hand, I began to write.
At 
first 
my 
words 
were 
concentrated, restricted even, 
limited to the topics of college 
and leaving the bubble of home. 
Then, 
suddenly, 
a 
barrier 
broke and everything poured 
out. Memories of insecurities, 
friendships lost and heartbreaks 
of the past flooded to the 
surface, spilling out of me like 
water. My hands failed to keep 
up with my thoughts, jerking 
from line to line as though 
possessed. Before I knew it, 
page after page was covered 
in black ink and the plane was 
close to landing. Emerging from 

my trance, I re-entered reality, 
hands shaking slightly and eyes 
wide and alert. I felt electric 
and 
refreshed, 
as 
though 
processing the words from my 
mind to the blank sheets had 
lifted a physical burden from 
my body. I felt weightless. 
It would be a lie to claim 
that my plane ride flirtation 
with journaling turned into a 
full-blown love affair. I did not 
become a daily journaler, nor 
did I find inner peace every 
time jotted down an entry, but 
I did discover the value in self 
reflection. Growing up in a 
technology-saturated 
world, 
I’ve had the privilege of access 
to endless piles of information 
at the touch of a screen. But just 
as this information overload is a 
blessing, it is also a curse. In the 
maze of posts and likes, it is easy 
to get lost in the lives of others 
and 
inadvertently 
position 
ourselves on the backburner. 
More 
than 
anything, 
journaling has morphed into an 
outlet, a crutch and a therapeutic 
tool for reconnection. Though 
it kills the thirteen-year-old 
drama queen inside me to admit 
it, my parents were right all 
along. Their simple, sincere 
message to me all those years 
ago is one that I’ve finally 
decided to heed. Just write.

On comfort and journaling

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com


This week, The Daily celebrated 129 years of publication. Since that first day in 1890, The Daily has 
produced Pulitzer Prize winners, famous authors, national activists and world-renowned journalists. 
Every person that steps into this newsroom feels its impact, and when they leave they carry that 
influence into the world. For the Paper B-Side, we felt there was no more appropriate way to honor 
paper than to talk about our very own. Below is a timeline of interviews with Daily staffers of the past. 
Among them are American sports writer Adam Schefter and publisher Philip Power, familiar names 
that were once scrappy student reporters like the rest of us. As journalists come under fire for daring to 
search for answers, we look back and remember that it was never the popular choice to tell the truth. 
But someone’s got to do it. 
— Samantha Della Fera, Senior Arts Editor
David Kessel — Class of 1958, Medical faculty at Wayne State University
David Kessel was a graduate student studying biochemistry at U-M when he discovered the magic 
of The Michigan Daily’s newsroom. Having completed his undergraduate degree at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, Kessel was looking for something more to do on the University campus outside 
of academic obligations. 
“I quickly discovered that the typical graduate students were not the most interesting people on 
Earth, but The Daily was full of interesting people, so that’s the place I tended to gravitate toward,” 
Kessel said in a phone interview with The Daily.
Much like The Daily today, students in the ‘50s dedicated significant amounts of time and energy to 
produce the paper. “I wondered if they were really taking courses because they seemed to be there all 
the time,” Kessel said. 
The culture of The Daily and the University during the 1950s was significantly different than what 
we know today. 
“There was a high degree of repression in those days. Women had to be in their dorms by 9 o’ clock. 
If they got in after 9 o’clock, they sent a note to their mothers,” Kessel explained. It was a time where 
the Board for Student Publications made editorial appointments and had an influence in articles that 
ran for The Daily — they even had the power to censor.” 
Despite apparent subjugation at times, many incredible stories ran during Kessel’s time in the 
newsroom, including the testing of the Salk vaccine, a mild scare when people at the pharmacology and 
mathematics departments were accused of being Communists and the death of Stalin.
“When Stalin died, they got out this headline that said ‘STALIN DEAD,’ and the guy was in charge 
of the publication … came in the next day — he was furious. He said,‘I was saving that font for the end 
of the world!’” Kessel exclaimed. 
Kessel is in the medical faculty at Wayne State University. He says that although his life is filled with 
scientific writing, The Daily is where he really learned to write. To Kessel, a college newspaper like 
The Daily is not only valuable to the people who 
write for it and the student body, but to society as 
a whole. 
“Our room was always sort of a protected area 
— it was always a center of culture and knowledge. 
And I hate to see all of this disappear. But when 
newspapers disappear, it’s going to go with it, I’m 
afraid.”
Harry Perlstadt — Class of 1963/Public Health 
Class of 1979, award-winning sociologist and 
Professor Emeritus of Sociology at Michigan 
State University
Harry Perlstadt wrote for The Daily during 
a time when Tom Hayden was editor and sat in 
the newsroom in the presence of future world-
renowned academics and journalists. Perlstadt 
went on to become a distinguished sociologist and 
academic himself, currently teaching at Michigan 
State University (but still repping his U-M pride when our sports team beat State). He was the recipient 
of the Distinguished Career Award from American Sociological Association in 2014. 
Before Perlstadt was a renowned sociologist, he was a news reporter for The Daily, eventually 
working as the Sunday Magazine co-editor from 1962 - 1963.
“It was an exciting time on The Daily. I couldn’t stay up late enough when J.F.K. came and made his 
famous speech on the Union steps,” Perlstadt said in an interview with The Daily. 
Perlstadt said The Daily played a major part in shaping his college career. He scheduled his classes 
earlier in the day so that he could be at The Daily from four or five o’ clock in the afternoon until one 
in the morning. How did he do it? He and the rest of the newsroom survived off of the Cottage Inn that 
was always ready for editors and writers to pick up during Daily production.
“I wanted to call myself the 10 o’clock scholar,” Perlstadt joked. Perlstadt remarked that he only 
skipped class once for The Daily, and that was to interview a member of the United Kingdom Parliament 
— a fine excuse for a political science major. 
A lot of campus climate issues came to light with the help of The Daily during his time at the paper, 
Perlstadt said.
“You can now look back at it and say it was the beginning of women’s liberation on campus,” Perlstadt 
said. During his time in the newsroom, there was a Dean of Women, who worked to make sure that 
women at the University were following specific rules laid out for them, including curfews.
“There is this story of when Mary Markley was only a dorm for women, as all the dorms in the Hill 
area on campus were. One of my friends when coming back from The Daily in her sophomore year … 
had to throw stones up to her roommate at the second or third floor so her roommate would come down 
and let her in,” Perlstadt chuckled. 
Perlstadt most notably wrote about the GRE exam, calling it an “insult to intelligence.” The story 
ended up being picked up by other college publications all across the country and eventually into the 
hands of the powers that be who write the GRE.
A couple months later, James A. Lewis, then the Dean of Student Affairs at Michigan, sent Perlstadt 
over to Dean of LSA Roger Heyns’s office. In the Dean’s office, he was read aloud a letter which stated:
“Please be assured that the opinions of Harry Perlstadt expressed in The Michigan Daily do not 
represent those of the administration or the faculty of the University of Michigan,” Perlstadt recalled. 
He ended up winning an award for courageous editorial writing.
Perlstadt formed strong bonds with those in the newsroom, which he continues to cherish to this day. 
“My wife and I just had our 50th wedding anniversary a year ago in the summer, and we had a 
Michigan Daily table,” Perlstadt exclaimed. 
Philip Power — Class of 1960, Founder and chairman of the Center for Michigan
It was an easy choice for Harvard University transfer Philip Power to join The Daily. 
“Because family friends had been on The Daily, and I’d heard about The Daily, it seemed clear to 
me that The Daily and the people on it were the most interesting, most involved, most informed and 
most exciting place in the University,” Philip Power said in an interview with The Daily. Power became 
night editor for The Daily two months into his junior year. He eventually became editorial director, 
managing columns and editorials on the paper.
The Daily newsroom itself was set-up very differently than it is today, with on-site hot type printing, 
set by typographical machines and all. Power remembers all of this vividly.

The editing process was also a labor intensive task. The night editor would move into the “slot,” a 
gap in the middle of a circular desk, at about eight o’clock at night, to read through, edit and write the 
headlines for all the pieces to run the next day. 
The stories were then sent down to the dumbwaiter, a contraption that served as an outbox for pieces 
that lead to the composing room where they would go to the letter press to print. 
“It was a rather more labor intensive and complicated way of getting a paper ready,” Power 
explained, “but the fundamentals were the same; namely, good reporting, good writing accuracy and a 
commitment to what I consider then, and consider now, serious student journalism.”
Power became very close with his peers at The Daily, spending entire days and nights working on the 
paper with people like Tom Hayden. 
“Our job was to do what The Daily does today. Keep an eye on malfeasance and student concerns, 
and when the Administrative screws up to do our job as journalists,” Power explained. Even though 
there was a journalism department at University at the time, there was no place like The Daily to get 
hands-on training in journalism. 
The Daily played a large part in getting rid of Deborah Bacon, the Dean of Women during the time 
Perlstadt attended the University, through exposing her practice of sending letters to the parents of 
women who were dating Black men on campus.
Power grew to love local journalism, running 
many local newspapers. Now, he publishes 
and distributes Bridge Magazine, a Michigan 
newspaper read by 2.2 million people in Michigan 
and named the best newspaper in Michigan for 
the fourth year. He also served on the Board of 
Regents for 11 years here in Ann Arbor. 
Dan Okrent — Class of 1969, Pulitzer Prize 
Nominee and first public editor of the New 
York Times
Fresh from editing the sports section of his high 
school newspaper, Dan Okrent quickly found his 
niche at The Michigan Daily. A tried and true fan 
but no athlete, he pursued the next best thing in 
the sports world: working as a Daily sports staff 
writer. The ’60s political and Daily scene, however, 
quickly got a hold of him, lending his talents over 
to the news section by his sophomore year. “I saw 
that, particularly, given the time … ’65 to ’69, the real action was on the news side.” 
Just as much a product of its time as it was its students, Daily news coverage at the late ’60s spanned 
historic political events from the ongoing Vietnam War opposition to enduring civil rights movements. 
These very events embed themselves in the undergraduate career of Okrent. 
“In April 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King was assassinated. I wrote the obituary that appeared in the 
paper the next day. I had about an hour to write and I was pretty proud of that.”
It’s moments current Daily writers envision as history, from the assassination of Martin Luther King 
Jr. to the 1968 presidential campaign and election, that Dan Okrent paints across the Michigan Daily 
he knew as a college student.
The news section more or less embodied Okrent’s identity those formative years as a burgeoning 
journalist. The hustle and bustle of 420 Maynard enveloped his entire college existence beyond the 
words he wrote half a century ago. It was the rumble and chug of the printing press at 2 a.m., in-and-
out flow of Cottage Inn pizza boxes and everlasting bridge games that embodied the writing sphere of 
these journalists.
“It was just such an exciting place to be. You know, we socialize with each other, but there were no 
formal events. It’s just that we were very much involved in one another’s lives because the institution 
brought us together.”
It’s this world that amplifies the “quest for truth, fairness and honesty” that embodied Okrent’s 
undergraduate ambitions with more sophisticated packaging. Just as much as he shifted across 
newspaper sections, his style and voice evolved with every interview and article that wrote his Daily 
experience. Nowadays a prolific editor and author, he traces his strides and accomplishments to one 
obvious source.
“That’s where I learned how to chase things down that I felt that the world needed to know… I don’t 
know what I would have done had I not worked at The Daily.
Sara Fitzgerald — Class of 1973, author and former Washington Post editor
Sara Fitzgerald joined The Daily per the recommendation of a friend. Taking off as a staff reporter 
second semester of her freshman year, she quickly found herself engrossed in the habit of taking on 
news assignments by day and writing headlines by night. She eventually rose through the ranks to 
Editor-In-Chief two years later. 
“People have told me I’m the first woman Editor-in-Chief. I’m always a little but wary, because 
I know that there were some women, particularly in the… World War II years, and I know another 
woman who was the Top Editorial Official but didn’t apparently have that title. So I’m always careful. 
I don’t want to claim too much.”
Fitzgerald’s tenure coincided with the surge of second wave feminism. Her papers produced 
themselves in a pre-title IX world emerging from the political protest scene of the late ’60s. And right 
before her very eyes, Fitzgerald watched as the political sphere transcended legislation into her social 
space, women taking on more leadership roles than ever before. 
“It was challenging because the only models you had were the older guys you had seen in those roles.” 
This backdrop permeates throughout her work as a Daily writer. The articles of Fitzgerald’s time span 
significant political hallmarks from the Vietnam War opposition to the 1972 US presidential election. 
However, a feminist underbelly reigned apparent in this time period, more so than ever before. This 
glares prominently from articles that detail neglected sex discrimination claims and the gender wage 
gap, to a playful jeering at the concept of a “Playgirl” calendar. 
“And so I think The Daily provides an important function both in giving students an opportunity to 
express themselves in an organized format, whether it’s, you know, friends or online. And the flip side 
of that, I think it’s important for students to have their voices represented on campus.”
These very ideas ring true throughout Fitzgerald’s contemporary work. Crediting The Daily for her 
internships and jobs in the news industry, the writing topics she embraced at the time still follow her. 
Her upcoming 2020 novel centers itself on a group of Ann Arbor women she wrote about in The Daily 
in the ’70s who stood up against sexual discimination. 
“I think, just being at the University in the years of 1972, ’69 to ’73, those were the years it turned out 
to be a very empowering time for women.”
John Papanek — Class of 1973, former Editor-in-Chief of Sports Illustrated, founding editor 
for Sports Illustrated for Kids, founding Editor-in-Chief of ESPN The Magazine and Editor-in-
Chief of ESPN.com
“Those were the wild, wild days,” former Daily Sports writer and editor John Papanek said in an 
interview with The Daily of his time at U-M. Before Papanek began his extensive career in sports 
journalism when he was a freshman at the University. 
“The first week was non-stop protests … yelling and screaming and ultimately occupying the 
registration building, culminating in police riot busloads of police swinging clubs and getting guys and 
gals over the head. That pretty much was my indoctrination to college life,” Papanek explained about 
anti-war sentiments of the time. This made for a riveting time to be a journalist at The Daily. 
What fascinated Papanek the most, however, was not the politics of the protests, but that all the 
chaos came to a complete halt during football Saturdays.

‘Clementine’

Halsey

Capitol Records

SINGLE REVIEW: ‘CLEMENTINE’

Halsey 
has 
established 
herself as a powerful force in 
the music industry, taking her 
career beyond music and diving 
into the metaphors and artistry 
to make her sound come to life. 
The music video for her single, 
“Clementine,” which is 
the second release from 
her 
upcoming 
album 
Manic, is a testament to 
her profound emotions 
and artistic style. Halsey 
dropped the video on her 
birthday — Sept. 29 — 
and its artistic approach 
closely 
resembles 
her 
live performance for the 
Billboard Music Awards 
back in May. 
The video takes place in the 
viewing area of an aquarium 
and features Halsey and her 
brother, 
Servian, 
dancing 
among the tanks of aquatic 
animals. 
Like 
her 
BBMA 

performance, the two siblings 
perform in-sync movements 
and interact with each other 
in a manner that symbolically 
gives off the feel of the push and 
pull of conflicting personalities. 
As someone who has bipolar 

disorder, Halsey likes to play 
with the symbolism in dual 
identities, and “Clementine,” 
along 
with 
her 
previously 
released “Graveyard” give a 
glimpse into what that looks 
and feels like to her. 

The video follows the sibling 
duo through the aquarium 
where they exude a passionate 
energy up until the end when 
they 
reach 
a 
tunnel 
and 
suddenly start to slow down. 
Halsey 
walks 
away 
from 
her brother in a hazy 
manner, staring at the fish 
surrounding her before 
slumping to the ground, 
seemingly 
exhausted. 
The video ends on the 
most repeated line of the 
song “I don’t need anyone 
/ I just need everyone 
and then some.” Both 
the song and the video 
feel symbolic in many 
ways, and the title of her new 
album suggests the theme of 
internalized struggles will be 
prominent in the remaining 
songs of her collection. 
— Kaitlyn Fox, Daily Arts 
Writer

CAPITOL RECORDS

“At the game, you have all the radical students, the hippies, the 
long hair, people with smoke coming out of their nostrils all week, 
sitting side by side with the teachers, the professors, the alumni, the 
establishment, and they were all yelling and screaming together to kill 
Ohio State,” Papanek said. 
All the excitement in the air transferred to the sports world at the 
University, making it a very fun section to write for. 
Papanek recalls a particularly humorous story that was written by 
Bill Alterman, a Sports writer at the time, where Frank Lauterbur, 
then coach of the Iowa football team, was so distraught by his loss to 
the University football team that he delivered an aggressive string of 
profanities when asked about how felt about the game, which no one 
but the Daily published. To avoid another argument over publishing 
a string of profanity right now, I will link the article here for you all 
to see. 
Ironically, Papanek used his experience in a paper journalism to 
help Sports Illustrated and ESPN transfer from paper to the digital 
landscape, far ahead of most publications. He prophesied the changing 
digital landscape as outcompeting print media in the future.
“Magazines on paper and newspapers on paper are a very 
endangered species, and they’re disappearing fast,” Papanek 
explained. This significant transition comes with implications. 
Papanek believes that there is still a value to print journalism — a 
value that is lost when you switch to digital platforms.
“Without even reading a word of what you’ve written, someone 
could pick this up and say there’s quality here. There’s good work that’s 
been done here,” Papanek said. The challenge presented to young 
journalists and The Daily today is now that anyone can publish their 
thoughts on the web, how are we to establish ourselves as credible and 
truthful, when there is so much propaganda being published? 
“I hope and pray that Michigan Daily continues to stand for 
editorial freedoms, accuracy, truth and fearlessness,” Papanek stated. 
Tony Schwartz — Class of 1974, Former New York Times 
reporter and staff writer for New York Magazine and Esquire
Tony Schwartz joined the News section as a freshman eager to 
write about shoplifting, of all things. When his work appeared on 
the front page of the paper below The Daily logo, he was hooked on 
writing.
“Here I was, 18 years old and walking around the campus, and 
everywhere I walk there was my piece with my name on it. That was 
intoxicating to me … And so I continued to write,” Schwartz said in an 
interview with The Daily. 
Schwartz also pitched and successfully launched the Sunday 
Magazine, a magazine that ran inside The Daily. The Sunday 
Magazine would be published for years after he left, and it went on to 
win awards as the best college magazine. 

“To the people who were out there reporting news stories every 
day ... The Daily was their life and academics were purely secondary,” 
Schwartz explained. The Daily was in the midst of Watergate, 
challenging the journalists in the newsroom. And it showed. The 
Daily produced incredible journalists of high caliber, such as Pulitzer 
Prize-winner Eugene Robinson of The Washington Post. 
The Daily was a launching pad for Schwartz’s own journalism 
career. He got the opportunity to interview many high-profile people 
such as Arthur Miller (“The Crucible”) and Joseph Heller (“Catch 
22”). Heller happened to have a friend who was a managing editor at 
the New York Times, who vouched for Schwartz to get an interview. 
This worked, and Schwartz ended up getting a job at The New York 
Times. Many of the skills he used during his time as an esteemed 
journalist and novelist he learned at The Daily. 
“I learned how to be a reporter there. The standard to which we 
were all held was very high, and the respect that the paper got in the 
University community was high,” Schwartz said. 
The Daily is more than just a breeding ground for trained journalists. 
It is valuable to Schwartz to continue the tradition of highly respected 
journalism, writers who are accountable for their work and writers 
who hold the administration accountable for their actions. But could 
the changing landscape from paper to digital journalism change this 
accountability factor?
To Schwartz, the mere physicality of a newspaper changes the way 
he consumes news. 
“It’s this sort of joy of discovery that when I read the whole paper, 
you’re leafing through the pages, and you’re seeing stories in every 
section. Now it’s curated for me in a way that leads me to read what’s 
visible from scrolling down a certain distance,” Schwartz explained. 
The implication of this? Shrinking perspectives and worldviews. And 
this switch, although more convenient and efficient, can be dangerous 
to those on the back end. 
“I left journalism, partly because it was dying. In my mind, because 
I had made my living for a number of years writing books,” Schwartz 
said. As it gets more and more difficult for young journalists to join the 
workforce, Schwartz hopes that publications like The Daily can keep 
the world of top-quality journalism alive. 
David Blomquist — Class of 1976, Editor and publisher at the 
New Jersey Journal
Before becoming editor and publisher at the New Jersey Journal, 
David Blomquist was a writer and editor for the Arts section of The 
Daily. 
“For as lively an art scene that Ann Arbor had in the 1970s, the Daily 
Arts desk was not as hot. Perhaps because the news of the era was 
just so consuming,” Blomquist said in an interview with The Daily. A 
smaller Arts section, however, bought him the opportunity to quickly 
ascend the ranks at The Daily. 
During his time writing for Arts, Blomquist got the opportunity 
to interview classical pianist Vladimir 
Horowitz. At the time, the University 
Musical Society was wary of student 
journalists. The director at the time 
warned Blomquist that when he met 
Horowitz, he was not to touch his 
sacred hands, not even to shake them. 
“Horowitz walks in the room, 

grabs my hand, squeezes the bejesus out of it and just says,‘Horowitz.’ 
One word of introduction. The director (of UMS) looks at me like the 
world has just coupled. But we had a lovely conversation,” Blomquist 
said.
Blomquist eventually found himself at the newsdesk of The Daily 
during a particularly exciting morning. He was one of the first to 
catch wind of former President Richard Nixon’s resignation after the 
Watergate Scandal broke.
“I was sitting alone as the morning news editor. The phone rings, 
and it was a guy who was one of our regular news editors, who was on 
a summer internship at the News Bureau in Washington who called 
us and said, ‘It’s all over. (Nixon)’s going to give a speech tonight,’” 
Blomquist recounted. 
“We were determined to produce a great product. There were 
certainly University scars. Universities, then as now, were grappling 
with creating fair opportunities for women, and fair opportunities for 
people of color. Some of the first struggles over that happened in the 
’70s,” Blomquist said. The fast pace of the newsroom was endearing 
to Blomquist. 
“I today fall back on the experiences I got at 420 Maynard Street,” 
Blomquist said.
One particular person who had an influence over Blomquist in 
the newsroom (or rather underneath it) was Lucius Doyle, for whom 
the bench in the entrance of the Student Publications Building is 
dedicated to. 
“Lucius and his colleagues taught us things about the gravity of the 
printed word, about the necessity as a manager to get things right to 
communicate clearly and to respect the needs of others. 40 years later, 
Lucius is in this office with me every day, reminding me what it takes 
to do the job right … of all the people I was exposed to on the staff at 
Michigan, no one had a greater influence on me,” Blomquist said.
Gary Kicinski — Class of 1979, spent 33 years with Gannett 
newspapers, 22 at USA Today, now managing editor for 
Transport Topics
Gary Kicinski joined The Daily writing for the Sports section, 
covering minor sports and eventually making his way up the ranks to 
editorial work. 
“Everything that I learned at The Daily turned out to be much more 
valuable for my career than anything I learned in the classroom,” 
Kicinski said in an interview with The Daily. The Sports section had a 
special set-up to train their journalists. 
“We had this really good process in Sports of posting a daily 
critique of that morning’s paper … It would be an examination of the 
page layout for sports and the writing that everyone produced for that 
paper. It was often written in a very entertaining fashion …. everyone 
would stroll in between classes to read it,” explained Kicinski.
