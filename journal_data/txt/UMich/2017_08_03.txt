Artists discuss the 
evolution of Warped Tour 

By DOMINIC POLSINELLI

Summer Senior Arts Editor

I’m sure a lot of you are 

wondering why the Daily is 
covering Warped Tour in 2017. As 
a college newspaper, our standard 
music coverage typically includes 
anything from indie rock to 
underground hip hop — anything 
but the Warped Tour scene. Yet 
in recent years, Warped has been 
actively marketing the festival 
toward older crowds, those who 
reveled in the scene as tweens in 
the earlier part of the 2000s. With 
bands like Silverstein, Hawthorne 
Heights, Adolescents and more 
whose popularity exploded more 
than a decade (or even two) ago, 
Warped 2017 has made a clear 
attempt to diversify its crowd 
demographic.

By attending Warped Tour’s 

Auburn Hills date just over a 
week ago and speaking with a few 
bands, I’ve learned that Warped 
is more than its perceived social 
stigmas. Warped is more than an 
opportunity for bands to perform 
to wide audiences and garner 
some new fans. It’s a time for 
bands and attendees alike to hang 
out with their friends and revel in 
the camaraderie of music.

Knocked Loose
It really goes without saying 

that Knocked Loose is a brutal 
band. With arguably the most 
popularity of the newcomers 
on the Full Sail Stage (the stage 
reserved for new, young bands 
on the tour), Knocked Loose’s 

crowds have been explosive and 
aggressive. 
Frontman 
Bryan 

Garris, while soft spoken and 
thoughtful in conversation, packs 
a punch on stage with his harsh 
vocals and an energy to match 
the crowd’s. Halfway through 
Warped, Garris has reflected 
positively on his experiences so 
far.

“(Warped has) been going 

great. It’s been a lot of fun. It’s 
hard work, but it’s so rewarding 
because our sets have been going 
better than they ever have. We’ve 
gotten the opportunity to play in 
front of so many new people. On 
top of that, we have old friends 
and have been making a lot of new 
friends. So it’s just been such a fun 
tour,” he said.

Garris has been fully aware 

of the band’s relatively popular 
status on Warped, citing past 
tours that have helped them 
gain this credibility with only 
one album and a few EPs to their 
name. Their set in Michigan was 
by far one of the best I witnessed 
throughout the day, featuring a 
pit barely contained within the 
confines of the width of the stage.

“I think that the overall hype 

has grown a little bit. Since then 
we toured Europe and Australia. 
Then we did a full US with Every 
Time I Die. I think that’s obviously 
helped people to notice us and 
help people to find out who we 
are so that our sets are a little bit 
bigger when we play on Warped. 
And then also we try to learn from 
everybody that we tour with… We 

are still very new, and we’re all 
very young so we look up to a lot of 
the people we’re fortunate enough 
to call our friends,” he said.

Garris also cited Hatebreed and 

Stick To Your Guns as his favorites 
to see on Warped this year, along 
with fellow newcomers Boston 
Manor and Movements.

After Warped, Garris said that 

we can expect new material to 
be on the way: “We were just so 
focused on Warped and preparing 
for this tour that we kind of put 
writing off, and we’ll probably 
jump into it when we get home 
because all of us are in that zone 
now — we are ready to write.

If you’re attending one of the 

later Warped dates, you can check 
out Knocked Loose on the Full 
Sail Stage where you can expect to 
hear some mind-blowing modern 
hardcore.

Microwave
As another first timer on 

Warped, frontman of Microwave 
Nathan Hardy has gained a 
positive outlook on the festival 
from his experiences, despite 
previous 
misconceptions 
of 

Warped’s social stigmas.

“We actually really love it. We 

were really hesitant for a long time 
about wanting to participate with 
Warped, just because we’re stupid 
I guess,” he laughs off. “I don’t 
know, I feel like there was a stigma 
associated with Warped for a long 
time… Like you’re marketing 
yourself to 14-year-old girls or 
something. But honestly it’s been

CEOs from health 
and ecology sectors 

discuss effective 
business models

By EDUARDO BATISTA

Daily Staff Reporter

Nearly 
30 
entrepreneurs 

gathered at the Ann Arbor SPARK 
headquarters on South Division 
Street to discuss emerging initiatives 
in the entrepreneurship community 
in Michigan Tuesday afternoon.

In addition to hosting CEOs 

from a variety of industries — from 
healthcare technology to gaming — 
the event also featured Rep. Debbie 
Dingell (D–Mich.), who represents 
Michigan’s 12th District.

Among the companies represented 

was 
Collective 
Scientific 
LLC, 

an 
accelerating 
drug 
discovery 

startup that works closely with drug 
developers to optimize research 
processes in the earlier stages of 
medicine discovery.

Bret Self, co-founder and CEO 

of Collective Scientific, highlighted 
his company’s role in reducing the 
amount of time research institutions 
spend on early development stages.

“At 
Collective 
Scientific, 
we 

speed up the process of developing 
early pharmaceutical research by 
using our softwares, algorithms 
and simulation to help our clients 
discover marketable drugs,” he said. 
“And we do this by modeling, through 
our molecule research services, a 
protein target and decomposing its 
properties on the molecular level, so 
we can understand how to speed up 
research.”

event

Freshmen upset over North Campus 
housing, request alternatives online

Waiting for housing 

assignment was 
“like waiting for 

acceptance letters all 

over again”

By DYLAN LACROIX
 Summer Daily News Editor

While 
many 
of 
her 
future 

classmates were eager to find fellow 
students also living in their residence 
halls at first-year student orientation 
this past month, LSA freshman 
Frances Bray was left in the dark.

“Most people that I talked to 

who had already heard about their 
housing were on Central Campus or 
the Hill and no one had heard about 
being on North, so I assumed they 
were just going worst to best,” Bray 
said.

Later, Bray would discover she 

was to be placed in Bursley Hall on 
North Campus, a 15- to 20-minute 
bus ride away from the University of 
Michigan’s Central Campus, where 
a majority of classes for first-year 
students are held.

Currently, 
University 
Housing 

offers 18 different residence halls 
and apartments for undergraduates 
to live in during the academic year. 
While most of these are located 
on Central Campus or in the Hill 
Neighborhood, just three are located 
on 
North 
Campus, 
comprising 

Baits Houses and Northwood III in 
addition to Bursley.

After finding out her housing 

assignment, Bray was one of many 
taking to social media to find any 
possible 
different 
arrangements 

for the upcoming year. On a closed 
Facebook group for incoming first-
year students called “University of 
Michigan Class of 2021,” students 
placed on North Campus are offering 
to pay to make the switch to Central 
Campus.

In an email interview, Bray said 

after discussing with her family, she 
was willing to pay upwards of $2,000 
to fellow students to move to Central 
but came up short with students 
willing to take the offer.

“We decided that we would have 

been willing to spend $2,500 to 
switch rooms, I knew it was a long 
shot and nothing ended up working 
out,” Bray said.

However, one of Bray’s main 

concerns with life on North is not 
the bus ride to Central every day 
but the inconvenience of the North 
Campus Recreational Building being 
closedfor the entirety of the 2017-2018 
academic year due to renovations.

“The biggest impact I think it will 

have on my freshman year is not 
having a rec center that’s convenient 
for me,” Bray said.

In an attempt to not fully remove 

Recreational Sports from North 
Campus, a small limitedspace within 
Bursley Hall will be temporarily 
transformed into an exercise space 
for regular patrons in addition to the 
over 1,200 students who will be living 
in Bursley Hall alone.

With so many students seeking 

to get off of living on North Campus 
freshman 
year, 
Engineering 

freshman Oliver Li decided to 
get creative by making an online 
fundraiser to help get his friend, 
fellow 
LSA 
freshman 
Mahir 

Taqbeem, to Central Campus.

In an email interview, Taqbeem 

said he was one of the last of his 
friends to get his housing assignment 
after they had all found out they’d be 
living on Central Campus.

“I was waiting pretty long to get 

my assignment and all my friends 
got their housing a while ago, so my 
anticipation was building every day,” 
Taqbeem said. “I was actually pretty 
confident that I would get something 
on Central, and I guess that was my 
mistake.”

Since most first-year students will 

be on Central Campus, he feels the 
social environment on North will be 
much more unfriendly and spaced 
apart, fearing he won’t have the 
same social opportunities as other 
students.

“I’m worried I won’t make as many 

friends freshman year, but I’m sure I 
will get over it if I do end up living in 
north,” Taqbeem said. “I heard that 
North Campus and Baits II especially 
were more antisocial.”

With the fall semester less than six 

weeks away, Taqbeem is rushing to 
find an alternative option on Central 
Campus.

“I’m desperate,” Taqbeem said. 

“To get on to any Central Campus 
dorm, I would be willing to offer up 
to $500 plus football season tickets.”

LSA freshman Nina Chiuchiarelli 

said after waiting for months to 
receive her housing assignment for 
the upcoming semester, she began 
to feel frantic but still believed she 
wouldn’t be placed in Bursley Hall on 

North Campus.

“June and July passed, and we still 

had not received our assignment; I 
started to get a little frantic, but again 
never thought of North Campus,” 
Chiuchiarelli said.

Once 
receiving 
her 
housing 

placement, Chiuchiarelli said she 
looked to online reviews of the dorm 
to learn more about where she’d be 
living and decided she wanted to 
switch.

“I will no longer, technically 

speaking, be moving into U of M’s 
campus, but instead a foreign place 
two miles away from where all of my 
classes are,” Chiuchiarelli wrote in an 
email. “I looked online for maybe two 
hours after finding out where I would 
be living this year and every single 
review was a poor one that discussed 
the isolation, lack of social life, 
horrible bus rides, the earlier wake up 
that each student not in engineering 
must endure (I have 8 AMs every day 
and again have no classes on North 
Campus) and just the simple fact 
that I do not get to reside with the 
majority of my peers, or the people 
that I will be in classes with.”

For 
LSA 
freshman 
Davinder 

Sekhon, the anticipation of receiving 
the email for housing assignments 
was like applying to college all over 
again.

“Waiting for housing assignment 

was a bit like waiting for acceptance 
letters all over again, with Central 
Campus being like getting accepted 
and North Campus being rejected,” 
Sekhon said.

For 
Sekhon, 
having 
to 
live 

on North Campus came with a 
significant negative impact on his 
first-year experience.

“I guess I always just generally 

accepted that North Campus was 
really bad for social life and getting to 
classes,” he said. “I had really wanted 
Central Campus because the social 
aspect of college is a big thing for me.”

Unlike other freshman placed on 

North Campus, Sekhon said he has 
come to terms with living on North 
and doesn’t feel the need to make any 
offers to move to Central.

“I think I’ve just accepted North 

Campus now and to be honest the 
more I think about it, the less I 
come to care about it,” Sekhon said. 
“Everyone in my group chats for Baits 
II seem cool and we already have 
made ourselves a nice community.”

roundtable discussion in which 
entrepreneurs had the opportunity 
to talk in greater depth about their 
companies. 

Jonathan Goldstein, one of the 

event organizers and director of 
operations for SPARK, emphasized 
the role of SPARK in helping Ann 
Arbor entrepreneurs succeed in their 

ventures.

“So one of the things that fuels our 

work is just the reputation of Ann 
Arbor as a startup ecosystem,” he said. 
“And fortunately SPARK has a really 
strong name as an organization. And 
within this ecosystem we are lucky 
that we have so many startups here 
right now with SPARK’s incubators 
themselves.”

Goldstein also explained the steps 

that an aspiring entrepreneur can 

take to launch a successful business 
in Ann Arbor.

“We have an online form where 

people can submit their business 
ideas,” he said. “From there, we are 
able to reach out to the entrepreneur, 
to help him or her find direction. And 
then we walk them through how 
they could scale their company, how 
we could work with them, how we 
could use our resources to work with 
them.”

Following 
the 
roundtable 

discussion, 
entrepreneurs 
and 

Dingell toured successful startups in 
Ann Arbor, including Workit Health, 
a provider of personalized addiction 
care programs, and SkySpecs, an 
aerospace 
engineering 
company 

that inspects failures in autonomous 
drones.

At Workit Health headquarters on 

South 5th Avenue, Dingell disclosed 
her personal connection with the 
topic of addiction.

“My father actually had problems 

with addiction, so the work that 
Workit Health and the whole team do 
is very personal to me,” Dingell said. 

Dingell 
pointed 
to 
Lisa 

McLaughlin, the co-founder and 
co-CEO, expressing her interest in 
the subject. 

“I am sorry that I have so many 

questions for you,” she said. “I am 
simply fascinated by the topic and I 
care deeply about it.”

She also emphasized the role that 

government can play in helping the 
entrepreneurial community in Ann 
Arbor and in Michigan succeed.

“The reason why I am here 

today 
is 
to 
understand 
the 

needs of entrepreneurs and the 
impact that they can have in the 
Michigan 
community, 
whether 

that be in healthcare, technology 
or transportation,” she said. “I 
believe that by partnering with 

entrepreneurs, 
government 
and 

private 
investors 
can 
promote 

welfare in Michigan communities 
and help accelerate the growth of 
new technologies that have a positive 
effect on people’s lives.”

Incoming freshmen prepare for business school with 
Ross summer courses, discussion with professionals

Students engage 
with peers through 
study groups, case 
competitions and 
collaborations with 

campus groups

By CHETALI JAIN

Summer Daily News Editor

Some incoming Ross School 

of Business freshman at the 
University of Michigan from 
under-resourced high schools 
and diverse backgrounds have 
the opportunity to partici-
pate in a four-week program 
designed to expose students 
to the rigors of the Business 
School and provide them with 
the opportunity to network 
with key contacts before the 

school year begins.

Since 
the 
Ross 
Summer 

Connections 
pilot 
program 

launched on July 12, the 19 par-
ticipants have been living in 
Cambridge House and attend-
ing classes that resemble ones 
they will be enrolled in during 
the fall semester. Subjects cov-
ered include Calculus I, Eco-
nomics 101, First-Year Writing 
and Business Administration.

Rhonda Todd, director of 

Academic Success at Michi-
gan Ross and director of RCS, 
explained how the invitation 
to join is based on multiple 
criteria including familiarity 
with the business field. She 
discussed the overarching goal 
to immerse the students in an 
authentic and comprehensive 
Business 
School 
experience 

that eases their transition from 
high school to the University. 

“We’re giving students who 

typically could use the addi-
tional resources the opportu-

nity to thrive in the program 
as opposed to just surviving,” 
Todd said. “These are students 
who want to spend their time 
getting acclimated to the cam-
pus and rigor … They want to be 
here.”

According to Todd, the stu-

dents get a head start on impor-
tant topics that will be relevant 
to their Ross education. RSC 
participants learn about cre-
ating 
a 
professional 
online 

presence, email etiquette and 
time-management, 
among 

other skills.

Diana Gaspar, a first-gen-

eration Mexican student from 
a rural Michigan town called 
Berrien Springs, is one such 
participant. Gaspar said she 
had found RSC to be one of 
her favorite summer experi-
ences. She said the program is 
an excellent way to familiarize 
herself with the environment, 
people and academic expecta-
tions of the University, as well

Sen. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) speaks to the audience at a town hall-style forum.

as to boost her confidence.

“My school did not offer AP 

courses; I had never experienced 
a high rigor class,” Gaspar said. 
“Compared to those who were 
coming in with 30 plus AP cred-
its, I felt inadequate. RSC has 
given me the confidence and 
experience, to take on the upcom-
ing courses. I now know I am not 
going to be thrown in here com-
pletely blind.”

Jordan Tran, one of Gaspar’s 

fellow 
RSC 
cohort 
members, 

shared the positivity towards the 
program and found it rewarding 
to get ahead in courses such as 
Economics 101 and hear from the 
guest speakers. Tran was raised 
in Ann Arbor by his Vietnamese 
parents and went to high school 
in the area. He said he found the 
opportunity to hear from and 
connect with guest speakers to be 
rewarding and looks forward to 
exploring his interests once the 
fall semester commences.

“RSC has already helped me in 

countless ways,” Tran said. “In 
all our classes, we have home-
work … midterms, and final 
exams … By the time the fall 
comes around, I will already be 
in school mode and I don’t need 
time to make that transition. All 
our speakers come from different 
backgrounds and it’s really great 
to see how diverse the University 
of Michigan, as well as (the Busi-
ness School), is.”

Along with professional and 

academic preparation, the RSC 
has a social aspect through which 
students collaborate in study 
groups, compete in case compe-
titions and engage with various 
campus groups and city events, 
such as the Ann Arbor Street Art 
Fair. Both Gaspar and Tran noted 
they formed friendships with 
their peers through the program.

The program runs until Aug. 

5, giving students ample time to 
reflect on their experiences and 
take a break before returning for 
classes in September.

Why they voted no

I 

n a rush to repeal the Affordable 
Care Act, Republican leaders 
introduced the Health Care 

Freedom Act to the Senate floor at 
approximately 10 p.m. Thursday night. 
More 
famously 

known as the 
“skinny repeal” 
health care bill, 
the 
lawmakers 

were only given 
a few hours to make a decision on their 
vote. The Senate Republicans needed 
50 votes total to pass the bill, with 
the assumption that Vice President 
Mike Pence would break the tie. Early 
Friday morning, the bill failed at a vote 
of 51-49; most famously as a result of 
Sen. John McCain (R–Ariz.) voting ‘no.’ 
Two other senators, Susan Collins of 
Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, 
also opposed their party by voting 
against the bill.

Often, 
first 
glances 
at 
the 

media 
coverage 
of 
the 
Trump 

administration’s recent actions tells us 
little of the practical implications and 
results such actions will have. When 
the “skinny repeal” bill failed on the 
Senate floor, the highlights of the event 
drew partisan reactions on both sides. 
Though Collin’s and Murkowski’s “no” 
votes were not necessarily surprises, 
their lack of support to a Republican-
written bill has the right-wing feeling 
betrayed by their own party. McCain’s 
surprise vote, however, left a deeper 
feeling of resentment, and as a result, 
the headlines the next morning 
portrayed him as both the hero and the 
villain. It seems as though the pressing 
issue of health care law in the United 
States was taken over by the drama of 
partisan disagreement. The knowledge 
of the vote is widespread, but the 
knowledge about the substance and 
implication of the health care repeal bill 
seems less understood. The partisan 
divide has ruptured divides along 
party lines, yet more imperatively, it 
has served as a bitter distraction from 
the substance and the importance of 
the law in context. 

The bill was not released to the 

public until after the vote. The secrecy 
and haste of the bill promoted the idea 
that repealing the ACA held greater 
priority over the quality of the health 
care reform. Thrown together quickly 
in hopes of dismantling Obamacare, 
the bill held major flaws that would 
have resulted in many negative 
consequences for the American people. 
If passed, the health care legislation 
would have repealed the ACA’s 
controversial individual and employer 
mandate and also make room for 
states to allow other insurances that 
don’t fall under the ACA’s regulations. 

This means that there is a no financial 
penalty for (most) Americans who 
decide to not carry health insurance. 
This is good news for those who 
keep their bodies healthy, especially 
younger Americans. However, the 
“skinny repeal” bill lacks incentive 
for the majority of Americans to stay 
continuously insured, which is essential 
to avoid ever-increasing premiums and 
for the market to stay healthy. This 
new legislation would have made the 
adverse selection problem much more 
serious to the death spiral result of 
insurers leaving the market. According 
to the Congressional Budget Office, 
14 million more Americans would go 
uninsured in 2018 with the “skinny 
repeal” than under the ACA. Premiums 
would increase 20 percent by next year.

The answer to the problem of health 

care in the United States exists in the 
improvement of the current plan or 
in a truly and substantively improved 
replacement plan. The Health Care 
Freedom Act is neither of those. It is 
rather a result of a partisan conflict, 
which has only grown to the point 
where the real priority of health care 
accessibility becomes second place to 
the reputations of the political party 
and 
presidential 
administration. 

Before making his vote, McCain made 
a statement assuredly enlightening his 
reasoning for voting no on the bill.

“Merely preventing your political 

opponents from doing what they 
want isn’t the most inspiring work,” 
he said. “There’s greater satisfaction 
in respecting our differences, but 
not letting them prevent agreements 
that don’t require abandonment of 
core principles, agreements made in 
good faith that help improve lives and 
protect the American people.”

Susan Collins released her reasoning 

on Twitter following her vote, stating, 
“When dealing w/ a complex issue 
that affects millions of Americans 
& 1/6th of our economy, we must 
proceed carefully.” The statements of 
each Senator show their value of the 
protection of the health of American 
citizens and their welfare. Regardless 
of the administration’s pressure, party 
loyalty and the recognition they may 
have received from their own party, 
each Senator acted according to their 
belief that the welfare of the American 
people take precedence over the 
achievements of any administration 
and to whose party it belongs.

U

s college students seem 
to have a lot to complain 
about — stressful classes, 

struggling 
relationships, 
severe 

lack of sleep and, perhaps most of 
all, lack of income. With tuition 
costs climbing every year and the 
adolescent population increasiime to 
recognize its value.

Last week, another attempt to 

repeal the Affordable Care Act failed 
in dramatic fashion. A video of Sen. 
John McCain (R–Ariz.) voting down 
the initiative showed overwhelming 
shock 
and 
surprise 
from 
the 

senators 
present. 
The 
liberal 

world met McCain with praise and 
gratitude for stepping over party 
lines and defending health care. 
And this is for good reason; his vote 
helped save health care for millions 
of Americans.

However, what a lot of liberal 

publications are criticizing is that 
Sens. Susan Collins (R–Maine) and 
Lisa Murkowski (R–Alaska) also 
voted against the bill and are not 
praised to the same extent. While 
McCain is being heralded as the force 
that saved health care, these female 
senators aren’t given any credit.

This is a prime example of the 

media throwing women into the 
shadows of men. This happens every 
day, but many poignant examples 
came 
from 
the 
2016 
Summer 

Olympics. The media coverage of 
women athletes often was centered 
on their husbands or their male 
coaches. For example, when Katinka 
Hosszu of Hungary set a world record 
and won her first gold medal in the 
400-meter Individual Medley, the 
media focused their attention on her 
husband and coach, Shane Tusup. 
An NBC commentator went as far to 
say, “There’s the guy responsible for 
turning Katinka Hosszu, his wife, 
into a whole different swimmer.”

So, to criticize the coverage of 

McCain and the lack of coverage of 
Collins and Murkowski is completely 
valid and necessary. There needs to 
be a reform in the media’s coverage 
of women, and women need to 
be given the credit they deserve. 
What Collins and Murkowski did 
was equally if not more courageous 
than what McCain did, as these 
less established senators have 
much more to lose than McCain 
does.

This being said, while the rest 

of the public has heard primarily 
about 
McCain, 
myself, 
being 

in a liberal circle, have mostly 
heard about these two women. 
I have read many articles about 
these two women and have heard 
many of my friends complain that 
these two women aren’t getting 
any credit. But when I say I have 
mostly heard about these two 
women, I literally mean that I’ve 
heard about “these two women.” 
Whenever I have heard about 
this from my liberal friends or 
my liberal publications, they all 
fail to even say Murkowski’s or 
Collins’ names. It’s sad that issue 
of credit is compounding itself on 
both sides. On one side they don’t 
exist, and on the other they are 
nameless women who are praised 

but are still silhouettes in the 
shadow the household name 
John McCain casts.

In fact, so many of the articles 

fail to even mention Murkowski 
or Collins in the headline. The 
Independent reads, “Forget John 
McCain — these two Republican 
women saved Obamacare.” It’s 
hard to forget John McCain 
when he’s the only name in the 
headline. Refinery29, a publication 
about and for women, published a 
headline with a similar message, 
“Thanks 
John 
McCain, 
But 

These Women Are The Real 
Heroes.” 
The 
sentiments 
are 

pointed in the correct direction 
with these articles but even some 
publications looking to shine the 
light on Murkowski and Collins 
chose to leave them nameless. 
This is probably part of “clickbait” 
culture, using the more-popular-
than-ever McCain to draw in more 
readers and in turn more revenue. 
So “these women” are very well 
casualties to clicks in this instance.

It’s great to see a push back 

against their lack of coverage, but 
let’s also push to remember the 
names of Murkowski and Collins. 
Their contribution toward the 
fight to preserve health care could 
not be overstated. Additionally, if 
you ever see the phrases, “these 
women,” “this woman,” “the wife 
of” or anything in between, take 
a moment to think of the names 
behind these silhouettes and push 
to reform how the media treat the 
nameless.

OPINION

Thursday, August 3, 2017

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

even begin to bombard you with 

an account. I mention these 

legends to compare to all of the 

artists they have inspired today, 

not only in their music, but their 

lyrics, persona and flow. But 

also, to establish the fact that so 

much, yet so little, has changed 

in the rap game. Eminem’s The 

Slim Shady LP, N.W.A.’s Straight 

Outta Compton, The Notorious 

B.I.G.’s 
Ready 
to 
Die, 
Jay-

Z’s Hard Knock Life and Nas’ 

Illmatic are titles of albums 

recorded 
by 
several 
of 
the 

legends I mentioned above, each 

different, unique and iconic in 

their own right, but yet, each 

all the same as they are branded 

with the large parental advisory 

warning on their covers.

“One, two, three, four, five, I 

am the greatest rapper alive. So 

“damn” great, “motherfucker” 

I’ve 
died, 
and 
what 
you’re 

hearing now is a paranormal 

vibe.” I left out some of the 

words included in this quotation 

because of their explicit nature, 

but it is spoken by Kendrick 

Lamar in his single “The Heart 

Part IV,” which preceded the 

release of his now certified 

double platinum album, DAMN. 

Let me tell you, when I heard 

him spit those rhymes over 

an incredible beat switch-up, 

I almost died myself. DAMN 

has indeed solidified Lamar’s 

high ranking in the widely-

popular 
debate 
over 
today’s 

best MC, including artists like 

Drake, J. Cole and Kanye West, 

each of whom have also made 

proclamations 
that 
they 
are 

the greatest, and additionally 

express 
themselves 
through 

explicit and vulgar lyricism.

This 
past 
week, 
I 
had 

the pleasure of seeing both 

Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole live 

in concert and have previously 

seen my other favorite artists 

as well: Drake, Kanye and 

Big Sean. Before each hip-

hop concert, besides feeling 

the anticipation of a sold-

out crowd packed into the 

arena, I usually feel nerves 

deep in the pit of my stomach, 

which 
makes 
me 
cringe. 

This is because of one single 

question/realization: Are they 

going to say it?

By they, I mean white people 

and others. By it, I mean the 

n-word when singing along. I 

was recently playing the song 

“The Story of O.J.” from Jay-Z’s 

latest album 4:44 on my speaker 

at home. If you aren’t familiar, 

he says the n-word exactly 10 

times consecutively throughout 

the chorus. Uncomfortable and 

disgruntled, both of my parents 

asked that I turn “that crap” 

off. A few weeks ago, Jay-Z 

announced the tour dates for 

the 4:44 album. Imagine the 

crowd singing along to that.

Rap/hip-hop 
now 
finds 

itself with a permanent stake 

in 
pop 
culture, 
specifically 

with 
today’s 
generation 
of 

youth. It is no longer just 

about the music; its influence 

now finds itself in the realms 

of fashion, sports and film. 

However, along with it comes 

the glamorization of violence, 

drugs, alcohol and sex; the 

sexualization and degradation 

of women and perpetuation of 

not just explicit “curse” words 

but also derogatory language 

regarding race, religion and 

sexual orientation. Yes, parental 

advisory labeling warns of the 

explicit content within music; 

however, it doesn’t prevent the 

audience from using it. The lines 

have become so blurred on what 

is “acceptable” and what isn’t. 

Use of the n-word will never 

be okay. Referring to a woman 

as a b***h will never be okay. 

Homophobic and transphobic 

slurs will never be okay. And 

it 
doesn’t 
matter 
if 
Drake, 

Kendrick, Kanye or Eminem 

says it. It doesn’t matter if you 

have Black or gay friends. It 

doesn’t matter if you thought 

it was okay…or if you didn’t 

mean it that way. There is no 

justification.

Due 
to 
its 
worldwide 

popularity, 
in 
addition 
to 

my own personal knowledge 

regarding it, throughout this 

piece I only reference rap/hip-

hop music and artists. However, 

I do not want my decision to 

do this to be misconstrued. I 

am 
not 
identifying 
rap/hip-

hop music as the only culprit 

of explicit, violent and vulgar 

messaging. Think back to indie-

pop band Foster the People’s 

smash hit “Pumped Up Kicks.” 

Insanely catchy, it blew up both 

the alternative and pop charts. 

But what many fail to realize 

is its meaning, which tells the 

story of a young boy who brings 

a gun to school intending to kill 

his classmates. Or what about 

Justin 
Bieber’s 
proclamation 

in the song “Cold Water,” that 

“everybody gets high sometimes 

you know? What else can we 

do when we are feeling low?” 

The Weeknd’s hit “Earned It” 

was used as the theme song for 

the “50 Shades of Grey” movie 

— which I am certain needs 

no 
explanation. 
How 
about 

Rihanna who, a woman herself, 

perpetuates the notion that it 

is okay to refer to females as a 

b***h or h*e? I reference these 

examples because I want to 

make it perfectly clear that rap/

hip-hop is not the only genre of 

music that needs some cleaning 

up. These artists and songs 

that I mentioned are played 

on heavy rotation throughout 

pop stations with audiences as 

young as toddlers. I am all for 

freedom of expression as an 

artist. One could argue, what 

would genres like rock or rap/

hip-hop be without its grit and 

brutal honesty or pushing the 

boundaries? But what becomes 

too 
much? 
Too 
provocative? 

Where is the line drawn? And 

when do we, as listeners, start 

to question it?

I 
absolutely 
loved 
going 

to 
concerts 
with 
headlining 

rap/hip-hop artists, as some 

of my favorite songs are by 

musicians I mentioned in this 

piece. However, while there, 

even throughout the blast of 

the music, dancing, roar and 

excitement of the crowd and 

thrum of the bass, I could 

not shake the nervous feeling 

that I mentioned earlier. My 

anticipation of the discomfort 

I would feel if the audience 

decided 
to 
sing 
along 
with 

the rapper and say the n-word 

became too subtly distracting. 

The entire time, a whisper in the 

back of my mind kept repeating,

Are they going to say it?

…They did.

“

Hi! My name is...What? My 

name is… Who? My name 

is…Slim 

Shady.” 
To 

me, these are 

some 
of 
the 

most 
iconic 

lines to ever 

grace a rap/hip-hop song. In 

1999, 
Eminem 
released 
The 

Slim Shady LP, marked by the 

widely popular song, “My Name 

Is.” Eminem’s lewd, rude and 

violent 
lyricism 
throughout 

not only The Slim Shady LP, 

but also each and every one 

of his following albums have 

identified him as one of the 

greatest 
yet 
controversial 

rappers 
of 
this 
generation. 

Eminem 
sprouted 
from 
the 

vision and mentorship of the 

legend Dr. Dre, who also shares 

a contentious history as member 

of the hip-hop group N.W.A. 

Either idolized or hated, N.W.A. 

propelled themselves into the 

spotlight following the release 

of politically-charged hits like 

“Straight Outta Compton” and 

“F**k tha Police,” even finding 

themselves under the watchful 

eye of the FBI. Their raw and 

provocative music paved the 

way 
for 
the 
emergence 
of 

fellow West Coast artists like 

Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg. 

Simultaneously, the public was 

additionally awed by similar 

voices and stories from across 

the nation through the likeness 

of The Notorious B.I.G., Jay-Z 

and Nas.

The history of rap/hip-hop 

music and culture is far too 

rich, detailed and subjective to 

MICHELLE SHENG| CARTOONIST

Rap/hip-hop now 
finds itself with a 
permanent stake 

in pop culture


Charlize Theron (“The Fate 

of the Furious”) proved herself 
to be one of Hollywood’s biggest 
badasses after her performance 
as Imperator Furiosa in George 
Miller’s 
recent 
masterpiece 

“Mad Max: Fury Road.” In an 
industry where men dominate 
both on and off-screen, Furiosa 
was a much needed change 
after years of watching super 
masculine, pumped-up dudes 
fight bad guys. “Atomic Blonde” 
shows 
Theron 
and 
all 
her 

badassery, though this time 
playing 
Lorraine 
Broughton, 

a secret agent in 1989 Berlin. 
Despite many of the movie’s 
shortcomings, 
Theron 
solidifies 

her 
status 
as 

Hollywood’s go-to 
action star capable 
of snapping necks 
and fighting with 
nothing but a shoe. 

“Atomic Blonde” 

takes 
place 

during the final 
days of the Berlin Wall, but 
describing the movie’s plot is as 
complicated and stressful as the 
Cold War itself. Broughton is a 
secret agent sent to recover a 
confidential list of every Soviet 
field agent following the death 
of an English MI6 agent. From 
here on, the movie becomes 
increasingly confusing and hard 
to follow. The entire premise is 
built around trying to figure 
out which spy is allegiant to 
which country, which is a 
weak foundation and “Atomic 
Blonde”’s ultimate downfall.

Distracting 
from 
this 

mayhem are the many brilliantly 
choreographed 
action 

sequences. Theron, who tested 
her fighting chops briefly in 
“Mad Max,” is the centerpiece 
to every on-screen brawl. Her 
moves are timed to perfection 
and feature ample creativity, 
like using an enemy’s feet to 
knock someone out. Simply put, 
I haven’t seen a fight scene more 
entertaining than the one in the 
long-take spiral staircase — this 
sequence will be the role model 
for all future action movies. 
It’s 
believably 
unbelievable; 

its pacing isn’t lightning fast 
and characters actually appear 
fatigued. By the time the scene 

ends, it’s worthy of a standing 
ovation.

Theron is joined by James 

McAvoy (“Split”), who plays a 
fellow spy, and John Goodman 
(“10 
Cloverfield 
Lane”), 
an 

MI6 agent. No other characters 
display the same energy and 
stamina as Theron, and “Atomic 
Blonde” is entirely dependant 
on her performance. Her stoic 
and 
confident 
swagger 
are 

well-suited for a secret agent 
— she perfectly fits into the 
boy’s club of James Bond types 
— but in many ways, the script 
didn’t give her much to work 
with. A lot of the dialogue is 
predictable and forgettable; it’s 
neither cheesy nor witty. We 
don’t necessarily watch action 
movies for the dialogue, but it 

helps to have at least 
a few memorable lines 
people can walk out of 
the theater quoting.

“Atomic 
Blonde”’s 

screenplay, written by 
Kurt Johnstad (“300”), 
is adapted from Antony 
Johnston’s 
graphic 

novel 
“The 
Coldest 

City,” which almost 

excuses 
the 
underwhelming 

dialogue. “The Coldest City” 
laid out the groundwork for 
director David Leitch’s (“John 
Wick”) 
glossy 
visual 
style, 

combining 
grit 
with 
neon-

lit 
glamor. 
Leitch’s 
former 

career as a stuntman explains 
the perfect action sequences: 
No one is more qualified to 
direct these kinds of fights 
than a stuntman himself. He 
was hired to direct “Deadpool 
2,” and assuming it will be 
as successful as the first, 
his directing career is very 
promising.

At times, “Atomic Blonde” 

feels like a messier, more 
action-driven version of “The 
Americans.” Broughton bears 
resemblance 
to 
Elizabeth 

Jennings, 
and 
the 
show’s 

bleak, 
cold 
atmosphere 

likely 
influenced 
Leitch. 

And 
considering 
that 
“The 

Americans”’s side plots rarely 
become 
incomprehensible, 

“Atomic Blonde” is like one 
ongoing untidy, unnecessary 
side 
plot. 
Though 
with 
a 

modest budget of $30 million — 
this is cheap compared to other 
movies of its kind — “Atomic 
Blonde” offers everything we 
want to see in an action movie.

Imagine this scene for a minute:
You’re sitting on the couch 

of a nice Brooklyn apartment, 
preferably 
in 
Williamsburg. 

There’s a speaker in the corner 
attached to a record player. It’s 
shiny and large and resembles a 
children’s toy. You’ve never heard 
of the company which produced 
the speaker but the man sitting 
across from you will certainly 
assure you that, while you probably 
haven’t heard of it, it’s top of the 
line. Then he’ll make fun of people 
who say things like, “You probably 
haven’t heard of it,” because he’s 
aware that it’s easy to make fun 
of those kinds of people, and in 
acknowledging and getting in front 
of the stereotype he believes he has 
precluded himself from it, in a way.

Inevitably, after enough drinks, 

maybe two or three, he’ll make a 
vague reference to you about the ills 
of capitalism, and maybe religion 
too. “It’s the opioid of the masses,” 
but he can’t remember whether 
the quote refers to capitalism or 
religion. Doesn’t matter. It fits for 
both. But then, you have to wonder, 
how does he afford this apartment, 
and that speaker system?

You ask him, and he snaps back 

that you’re missing the point. That 
you didn’t hear what he actually 
had to say.

This is about the situational 

equivalent 
of 
listening 
to 

Everything Now, the fifth studio 
album by Canadian band Arcade 
Fire.

It’s not that the social and 

economic critiques are illegitimate; 
it’s that they’re vague, messy and 
reach only the thinnest level of 
self-awareness. It’s not that we 
should feel badly listening to 
the band because they’ve made 
it and they’re wealthy; it’s that 
we should question why these 
factors haven’t led to nuanced soul 
searching and genuine concern 
about contributing to the very 
problems which they haughtily 
deride. Everything Now is the band 
at their least aware, least sonically 
interesting and most violently 
grating yet.

Ironically perhaps, we can track 

where things went wrong for the 
band right back to their marketing 
strategies. Much was made about 
the enormous campaign for their 
last 
proper 
release, 
Reflektor, 

which landed in 2013. Buildings 
in Brooklyn were covered in huge, 
cryptic posters which advertised 
the upcoming album, and the band 
performed some secretive shows 
(publicized enough, though, so that 
the very existence of the shows was 
in itself a form of marketing). It 
was excessive, and it worked.

Already there was an odd 

contradiction 
here: 
aggressive, 

social media-based marketing for 
an album that was largely critical 
of social media and marketing. 
The band mostly got away with 
it because the album still felt like 
a legitimate effort. Laborious, 
actually. The themes stretched 
over two discs, centering around 
the idea of the “reflexive age,” 
taken from a 19th century Søren 
Kirkegaard essay, while applying 
it to modern day social issues. 
“We Exist,” for example, took on 

the parental and societal rejection 
that a gay person might deal with. 
Stand out “Here Comes the Night 
Time” discusses missionaries in 
Haiti over a sharp disco-rock beat 
laden with clever fake-outs. They 
took ambitious risks, pushing the 
album to 85 minutes. It fell short at 
times, and pushed too long at others, 
but their energy was still undeniably 
present. And though the marketing 
was over the top, it spoke to the scope 
that the album intended. It was huge, 
and so were the band’s ideas.

Leading 
up 
to 
Everything 

Now, Arcade Fire launched a 
parody 
Twitter 
account 
(@

EverythingNowCo) which mainly 
retweets 
cringe-inducing 
posts 

by corporate accounts like Olive 
Garden, as well as fan images of 
their own marketing efforts on 
Target store TVs and grimy subway 
cars. They also wrote a “Premature 
Premature Evaluation” of their own 
album, poking fun at Stereogum’s 
slightly 
sensationalized 
article 

“Remember When Arcade Fire 
Were Good?” which criticized their 
singles, particularly “Everything 
Now.” In their own Premature 
Premature Evaluation, they call 
themselves, among others things, 
“a goofier, less cool, extremely self-
serious, and less danceable Daft 
Punk,” referencing the influence of 
Thomas Bangalter on this record, 

later estimating that Everything Now 
will likely fall “probably somewhere 
between number 8 and number 14” 
on the year-end lists.

Apparently Arcade Fire want us 

to know that they get it. By infusing 
intense irony and metacritiques 
into their marketing campaign they 
assume we’ll distance them in our 
minds from the forces they poke fun 
at.

That’s not the case.
It reminds me of a problem laid 

out in David Foster Wallace’s essay 
“e unibus pluram,” referring to a 
movement of irony heavy “post-
postmodernist” fiction writers who 
attempt to give social criticism by 
entirely inhabiting the world in 
which they criticize. The result, 
Wallace explains, is “Instead, it most 
often degenerates into a kind of jeery, 
surfacy look ‘behind the scenes’ 
of the very televisual front people 
already jeer at, and can get behind 
the scenes of via Entertainment 
Tonight and Remote Control.” I 
think the same applies with Arcade 
Fire’s marketing strategy. 

Essentially, we already see and 

understand the absurdity of these 
corporate accounts attempting to 
seem “hip” by being on Twitter. 
When 
we 
see 
Olive 
Garden 

appropriate a Brandon Warrell 
meme about blow jobs, we don’t need 
Arcade Fire’s fake Twitter account 
to show us how odd it is. We already 
get it. It’s not cutting edge social 
commentary for the band to say, 
“Look! Corporations! Money!” 
And it’s certainly not cutting 
edge for that commentary to 
come in the form of a retweet. 
There is behind that veil of irony 
no legitimate, serious critique 
here, and the only effect that 
their pseudo-meta marketing 
produces is that more attention 
is placed on their hypocrisy 
as they continue to employ 
rather typical and unexciting 
marketing 
techniques. 
No 

matter how much they attempt 
to make fun of it and separate 
themselves, they are deeply 
engrained in that corporate 
system which they want you to 
believe they’re so against.

Their new album, like their 

marketing for it, is neither clever 
nor exciting. It too is surface-
level at best. At worst, it’s poorly 
constructed unintentional self-
parody.

Columbia Records

Tyler, the Creator awkwardly gazing 

really sick. Especially — I don’t 

know if it’s more this year than 
other years — I mean there’s a lot 
of bands that played Warped Tour 
like 15 years ago on this year, and 
more like long time punk bands 
— like Suicide Machines from 
(Detroit).”

Hardy hits the nail on the head 

with his observation about the 
lineup. But he also recognizes 
that Warped isn’t without its 
hardships. From hauling gear 
and merchandise to and from 
the site each day to surviving the 
heat through consecutive dates, 
Warped requires a ton of manual 
labor to pull off each day.

Despite these downsides — as 

Harding refers to Warped as a 
“bootcamp for bands” — he also 
believes that bands are able to 
improve as musicians on Warped. 
With consistent sound technicians 
for all the stages, Warped is 
certainly a far cry from the 
unpredictability of the club shows 
that the band is used to.

“Here, you have the same sound 

guy — there’s one guy for monitors 
and one guy for front of house. It’s 
the same people every day so they 
get you dialed in. You have the 
same mix every day. You get to be 
able to play better because it’s good 
practice when you can actually 
hear yourself and everything,” 
Harding explained.

Beyond all else, Harding most 

strongly 
recognizes 
the 
fan 

exposure new bands receive from 
playing Warped Tour.

“I mean every band, or a lot of 

bands, will say something at some 
point in the set and be like ‘How 
many people are seeing us for the 
first time?’ and it’s at least like 
two-thirds of the people every 
time. That’s so good for all those 
bands. Yeah, Warped Tour is tight. 
We like it,” he concluded.

Hardy mentions to no surprise 

that Boston Manor, Dance Gavin 
Dance and Municipal Waste as 
some of his favorite bands to 
watch on the tour, finally alluding 
to everyone’s favorite Warped 
Tour guilty pleasure:

“Attila is sick. It’s like Limp 

Bizkit, too. I loved Limp Bizkit. It 
was like one of the first bands that 
I loved. It’s just the same mentality 
that I loved about Limp Bizkit,” 
he said. “It’s so funny walking by 
(Attila’s) sets carrying something 
when you hear the shit he’s saying, 
going back and forth with the 

audience like ‘Suck my fuck!’ I 
envy him. That’d be so much fun.”

You can catch Microwave’s 

exciting modern punk rock on 
Warped’s Skullcandy stage.

Boston Manor
Pop punk can be a fickle 

genre — it’s incredibly hard to 
stand out amongst the seemingly 
endless stream of pop punk 
bands hopping on Warped Tour. 
Yet, with their debut album Be 
Nothing., the UK’s Boston Manor 
have effectively raised themselves 
above the rest with their stellar 
songwriting imagery and deft 
pacing 
of 
tone. 
Truthfully, 

breakout single “Laika” was one 
of the best punk bangers of 2016. 
Continuing to ride the momentum 
of the debut album, Boston Manor 
are experiencing popularity at 
Warped on par with the likes of 
Knocked Loose. Guitarist Mike 
Cunniff told me that their sets 
have been full of fans both old 
and new, and that their set earlier 
in the day didn’t disappoint.

“It was great man, yeah. It was 

pretty packed out. We had already 
been to Detroit before with Moose 
Blood and Trophy Eyes, so I think 
some of those fans came back to 
see us again — a lot of new fans 
as well. There was a lot of energy 
today so it was awesome,” he said.

We also discussed the pros 

and 
cons 
of 
Warped 
tour 

compared to the last few US 
tours Boston Manor has done. 
In exchange for catered meals, 
bands have less mobility to 
explore the areas they play on 
Warped due to the nature of the 
festival.

“It’s so different. Sometimes 

it doesn’t even really feel like 
you’re in the US sometimes... 
there’s a lot less time to explore 
because everywhere is sort of 
out in the sticks so you kind 
of gotta Uber if you want to go 
anywhere,” he said. “And we 
had a lot of fun touring the first 
two times we came here, and we 
got to see — a bunch of us had 
never been to the states before 
— so we got to see a bunch of 
really cool things like the Grand 
Canyon. And you stay at people’s 
houses as well, so you feel like 
you integrate a lot more into the 
country ‘cause I feel like that’s 
the best way to do it is to meet 
people, stay with people and 
share experiences. There’s a lot 
less of that.”

‘Ballers’ continues the 
party-comedy trope

When 
HBO 
fan 
favorite 

“Entourage” rode into the sunset 
in 2011, the network was left 
with a void in its “party-comedy” 
programming. No, party-comedy 
isn’t an actual type of show, but 
I’m coining the term to describe 
a series that centers its comedy 
around its obscene parties, so mark 
it down.

HBO tried, and failed, to fill this 

vacancy through an “Entourage” 
movie spin-off four years later, but 
it was another show that premiered 
that same summer — “Ballers” 
— that ultimately picked up the 
mantle from “Entourage.”

Throughout its first season, 

“Ballers” firmly established itself 
as a quality party-comedy, giving 
us an exciting glimpse into the 
sex-drugs-booze lifestyle of NFL 
players in Miami. Led by Dwayne 
“The Rock” Johnson (“Fast & 
Furious 6”), Anderson Financial 
Management more than embraced 
a work-hard-play-hard mentality. 
Never taking itself too seriously, 
“Ballers” had a strong first season 
that 
kept 
audiences 
engaged. 

However, the second season saw 
the series ratchet up its intensity 
through a drawn-out mentor-
protégé rivalry between Johnson 
and 
Andy 
Garcia 
(“Ocean’s 

Eleven”). Rather than returning to 
its roots, “Ballers”’s latest season 
doubles down on its rapidly-
expanding storyline and, while 

enjoyable, overextends itself at 
times.

For “Ballers,” most of the trouble 

it has encountered as a show is in 
trying to sell Johnson’s character 
as a shrewd businessman, despite 
the fact that it goes entirely 
against his background that the 
series established in season one. 
In its first season, “Ballers” made 
a point of emphasizing Johnson’s 
continued 
financial 
troubles 

that leave him on the brink of 
bankruptcy. The show went out 
of its way to present Johnson’s 
struggles 
to 
convince 
both 

colleagues and players he is capable 
with money.

After laying out this specific 

foundation 
for 
Johnson, 

“Ballers” 
proceeded 
to 
tear 

it down in season two, and 
continues to do so in season three 
at its own peril. While it’s typical 
for comedies to have characters 
that fluctuate frequently, these 
changes are always done in a 
way that doesn’t contradict a 
character’s essential quality or 
identity. “Ballers” makes this 
very mistake in the season three 
premiere, as Johnson attends 
a 
dinner 
hosted 
by 
casino 

magnate Wayne Hastings (Steve 
Guttenberg, “Police Academy”) 
and manages to woo him as a 
business partner. While it’s true 
that Johnson has improved his 
business acumen, it’s hard to 
believe he’s refined it enough to 
convince a financial mogul to 
partner with him, considering 

Johnson is the same person who, 
although broke himself, gave a 
$300,000 loan to another player.

If audiences can overcome its 

somewhat stretched storyline, 
“Ballers” rewards them with 
a wildly entertaining series. 
As a party-comedy, the series 
has 
consistently 
excelled 
at 

keeping viewers engaged and 
excited 
by 
focusing 
on 
its 

characters’ 
lifestyles 
rather 

than only their careers. From 
the supercharged Maclarens to the 
gorgeous yachts, “Ballers” revels 
in depicting the very best toys that 
Miami’s superstar athletes enjoy. 
Season three is no different, with 
its premiere featuring a few 
shots of Ricky Jerret’s (John 
David 
Washington, 
“Coco”) 

candy-apple red Ferrari roaring 
through the city.

Outside of its entertainment 

value, “Ballers” provides audiences 
with an effective number of 
hilarious scenes. Rob Corddry 
(“Hot 
Tub 
Time 
Machine”) 

continues 
to 
be 
the 
ideal 

complement to Johnson’s straight 
man, and, when paired, they 
dominate the screen with their 
chemistry. At dinner with Hastings 
and Johnson, Corddry takes the 
entire table by shock by toasting to 
living in a country “where a man 
is presumed innocent until he is 
proven guilty.” Corddry’s brash, 
childish personality continues to 
crack up viewers, and the hope is 
that “Ballers” can keep doing the 
same.

Concerns raised over cost of gubernatorial election

By CARLY RYAN

Daily Staff Reporter

Michigan’s 
gubernatorial 

candidates are leaning into campaign 
fundraising, with five declared or 
prospective 
candidates 
already 

backed by over $1 million in finances, 
according to the July finance reports, 
which were due Tuesday.

Gretchen Whitmer, former state 

Senate minority leader, has raised 
the most money in donations thus 
far, reporting $1,531,676. Though 
Whitmer 
has 
the 
most 
name 

recognition and is backed by multiple 
unions and national organizations like 
Emily’s List, Shri Thanedar, a political 
newcomer, is ahead in total finances.

Though Thanedar hasn’t raised 

nearly as much as Whitmer, he has 
invested $3.3 million of his own 
money into his campaign, after selling 

60 percent of his chemical testing 
company. A University of Michigan 
alum with a doctorate in chemistry, 
Thanedar has drawn parallels to 
Gov. Rick Snyder, both in having 
no political experience during the 
election and being from Ann Arbor. 
In the 2011 gubernatorial race, Snyder 
invested more than $6 million of his 
personal fortune.

However, Thanedar’s lack of name 

recognition leaves him with a rather 
long road to travel, especially when 
up against front-runner Whitmer, 
who recently won the endorsement 
of University Regent Mark Bernstein 
(D) after he pulled out of the race. 
In his statement, Bernstein tasked 
voters with uniting behind Whitmer’s 
values.

“A 
divisive 
and 
expensive 

Democratic primary would only 
distract us from this essential task,” 
he said.

The vast expenses required to 

run a campaign have been a point of 
contention for years, across all levels of 
office. In the 2014 gubernatorial race, 
Snyder, a Republican, and Democratic 
challenger Mark Schauer spent a 
combined total of about $58.3 million, 
according to the Detroit Free Press. 
In 2006, the race between former 
Democratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm 
and Republican challenger Dick 
DeVos cost over $80 million.

If the 14 prospective candidates 

don’t follow in Bernstein’s footprints 
and unite behind a candidate, the 
2018 election is on track to be the 
most costly yet, setting a problematic 
precedent, according to rising LSA 
junior Amanda Delekta, vice president 
of internal affairs of the University’s 
chapter of College Republicans.

“Money plays a pivotal role in 

campaigns on all levels in government 
and it is disheartening to turn an 
election, what should be a discourse 
of ideas and solutions, into which 
candidate can raise the most money,” 
she said.

Additionally, 
Abdul 
El-Sayed, 

another 
University 
alum 
and 

democratic 
candidate, 
has 
been 

raising large sums of money, topping 
the $1 million mark ahead of the 
filing deadline. El-Sayed has been 
campaigning 
aggressively 
across 

the state in an effort to catch up to 
Whitmer.

“Rather 
than 
establishment 

insiders, Michiganders want bold 
ideas, inspiration, energy, and fresh 
progressive leadership,” El-Sayed 
said in a statement.

Neither 
the 
University’s 

chapter of College Republicans or 
College Democrats have endorsed 

a candidate, though LSA junior 
Lauren Schandevel, public relations 
chair of College Democrats and a 
columnist for the Daily, said student 
involvement will be critical to the 
gubernatorial race.

“We love being a platform for 

students who are a huge part of the 
grassroots movement,” Shandevel 
said.

On the Republican side, Michigan 

Attorney General Bill Schuette, 
who is widely expected to receive 
the Republican nomination, has 
nearly $1.6 million he could use 
for his campaign, according to 
the Detroit Free Press, though he 
hasn’t announced he is running yet. 
Schuette received large donations 
from the Michigan Beer and Wine 
Wholesalers PAC and the DTE 
Energy Co. PAC, both about $30,000 
each. 

At 
the 
Michigan 
Republican 

Leadership Conference on Mackinac 
Island, Schuette addressed rumors 
of his campaign but still didn’t 
announce.

“We need a jobs governor from the 

Republican Party in 2018,” he said. 
“I’m not announcing today. My focus 
is jobs and paychecks and education.”

Likely opponent Lt. Gov. Brian 

Calley, who also has not announced, 
has a $1.2 million fundraising total. 
Both Calley and Schuette’s term limits 
are up for their respective positions, 
and even without announcing their 
plans to run, have pulled far ahead 
of official candidates Dr. Jim Hines, 
an obstetrician, and Sen. Patrick 
Colbeck (R–Canton), one of the 
most conservative voices in the state 
legislature.

Hines 
spent 
most 
of 
his 

campaign funds collecting the 
petition signatures required for 
nomination leaving him with little 
over $6,000 in funds, even after 
putting over $300,000 of his own 
money into the campaign.

Colbeck, who just announced his 

campaign on Saturday, reported 
having about $23,000 in the bank.

Among other Democrats vying 

for the nomination are William 
Cobbs, retired Xerox executive 
and U.S. Navy veteran with about 
$2,000 in the bank, and Southfield 
attorney Geoffrey Fieger, who 
reported a token $5 donation to his 
campaign in June and hasn’t closed 
the campaign committee he used to 
run as the Democratic candidate in 
1998. Other Democratic candidates 
Justin Giroux, Kentiel White, and 
Clyde Darnell Lynch did not file 
finance reports with the Secretary 
of State.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com MICHIGAN IN COLOR

AREEBA HAIDER, 2017
Demario, you are such a wonder in 

my life. I had heard incredible things 
about you before we ever even met. 
Every time I saw you living your life, 
literally just walking around cam-
pus and emitting light and sunshine 
and hope and happiness every-
where you went, I thought to myself, 
“wow, wouldn’t it be cool if we were 
friends?” And then a miracle hap-
pened and I met you at Espresso 
Royale when you were hanging out 
with one of my friends. You pretend-
ed to think I was funny, told great 
stories, and were just an incredible 
source of contagious enthusiasm. A 
week later, I interviewed to be a MiC 
editor, convinced more than ever 
that it was a space I wanted to join. 

Demario, your compassion, intel-

ligence, honesty, and commitment 
inspire me to be a better person. 
Ann Arbor has been blessed with 
your presence, and I can’t wait to see 
the incredible things you create and 
accomplish in D.C.

(I’m also going to use this oppor-

tunity to publicly ask you to please 
hang out with me when we are both 
in D.C. for the next semester so that 
you can’t say no. Be my friend! Con-
tinue to bless me with your pres-
ence!)

ASHLEY TJHUNG, 2017
So much of my social justice jour-

ney can be attributed to Demario. 
When I first began at MiC, I was an 
anxious first-year unsure about my 
place in the social justice commu-
nity and afraid that I did not know 
“enough.” Luckily, I had Demario 
as a guide. Every time I saw him he 
imparted new wisdom and knowl-
edge in a style all his own. His love 
for communities of color is evident 

from every interaction, and I know 
that wherever he goes in life he will 
continue to be the inspirational, 
positive, and abundant force that 
everyone at MiC had the pleasure of 
experiencing.

 
JASON ROWLAND, 2017
Last weekend, I was visiting 

Camp Michigania when I thought 
I saw you from across the room. 
To my surprise, there was a pile of 
booklets with your image gracing 
the cover. Above your face were the 
words “For the Best Michigan” — 
and no title would have been more 
appropriate than that. For the past 
few years, you’ve worked tirelessly 
to make this campus a more inclu-
sive and accepting place. When I 
turn on the news and get swallowed 
up by the negativity surrounding us, 
I find comfort in the fact that people 
like you still exist. Please keep up the 
fight, because it inspires us all to do 
the same!

SARAH KHAN, 2015
When I think about Demario, the 

first thing that comes to mind is his 
voice. When Demario speaks you 
can feel every word travel the dis-
tance between. I’ve always marveled 
at how every word seems to have 
presence, and how even his laugh-
ter is elevated (not to mention his 
incredible singing abilities). I hope 
that as he moves from Ann Arbor his 
rich laughter will fill every space he’s 
in. I’m thankful for his companion-
ship as we worked together, and as 
I was learning to come into myself. 
 

I’m grateful that MiC got to pass 
through Demario’s hands and get 
some of his magic--it, and myself, 
are all the better for it. 

Demario, I wish you nothing but 

light and happiness on your next 
journey. Much love to you always. 

GABY VASQUEZ, 2015
I will always be grateful to Teresa 

for encouraging me to contribute 
and, eventually, apply to become an 
editor for MiC, not only because of 
the amazing experience it was to 
be a part of such a powerful space, 
but because of the beautiful people 
I ended up forming such strong con-
nections with. Among those is, of 
course, Demario. Demario, a.k.a, my 
ray of sunshine, a.k.a, actual, pure 
ball of joy. Demario whose words 
never fail to inspire me, whose hugs 
never fail to lift my spirits, whose 
smile is legitimately contagious. 
Demario, you are one of the most 
phenomenal, 
talented, 
brilliant, 

genuine, kind people I have ever 
ever met and I’m eternally blessed to 
have you in my life wishing you the 
best luck in all that you do and I can-
not wait to see you in D.C.!!

 
ALYSSA BRANDON, 2016
Dear Demario, 
When I met you, I was incoming 

freshman at new student orienta-
tion. There I was, anxious, nervous, 
and afraid sitting in God-knows-
what auditorium on north campus. 
And, there you were, on the stage, 
singing that cheesy rendition of The 
Victors that everyone loves. So full 
of life. Clapping your hands. Danc-
ing around. Looking at you and all 
the joy and spirit you had made all 
the anxieties I felt dwindle for a 
moment, and I could actually visual-
ize everything being ok.

If you attended first year orien-

tation at U of M between 2013 and 
2017, you know Demario Longmire. 
You may not have had the opportu-
nity to meet him, be graced by his 
soul soothing voice or held in one of 
his pain releasing embraces, but you 
remember him. Because Demario 
has the presence of no one you have 
met before. He seemed to glow on 
stage, emit an energy which made 
you feel, for a fleeting moment, that 
being at this school would be OK. 
Maybe even good. Tuesday night, 
I watched Demario perform at his 
second to last first year orientation 
show. Though my brief moment of 
being at peace with attending this 
university has gone, my deep love 
and admiration for Demario has 
grown every day since.

I said goodbye to Demario yester-

day afternoon, and wanted to jam 
pack everything I have ever loved 
about and appreciated him for in a 
short half hour and a journal I got 
him in China with cartoon pandas 
on it. I realized that was impossible, 
and also that I should try and let him 
know these things every day. When 
it comes down to it, I think one of the 
greatest gifts Demario has given me 
is a sense of belonging. His empathy 
permeates the world around him, 
and I feel as though he can build 
community just by walking down 
the street (perhaps because travel-
ing around Ann Arbor with him is 
like traveling with a celebrity and 
we are stopped at every block).

One community that Demario 

has worked to build is Michigan 
in Color, and some of us who have 
been able to be part of it wanted to 
send him off to DC with the words 
he taught us to dig deep for. He 
always emphasized that we work 
to share our most authentic selves 
in our stories, to do so boldly and 
unapologetically. We are so grate-
ful that Demario was, and is, part of 
our stories, and we hope that we can 
express even an ounce of our grati-
tude for him.

Demario, thank you everything 

you are and embody. You are a light! 
I love you, I miss you, and I’ll see you 
soon.

--TONI WANG, 2016
 
CHRISTIAN PANEDA, 2017
My first encounter with Demario 

was during my first year at Michi-
gan where he and other now former 
MiC editors interviewed me for 
the position of Senior Editor. I was 
a very insecure wreck prior to and 
during the interview. Even during 
the beginning of my MiC career, I 

was still really nervous. I was very 
unsure of myself and thought I was 
brought on board as a weird stroke 
of luck. However, I had someone like 
Demario to help guide me and alle-
viate my fears rooted in imposter 
syndrome. He welcomed me with 
open arms my first time in the news-
room and continued to do so every 
single night. His humor and wit, not 
to mention excellent shade skills, 
are things to be admired.

I would like to reiterate what oth-

ers have been saying that Demario 
Longmire is an incredible human 
being, and I am very thankful that 
I had the privilege of working with 
him at Michigan in Color, let alone 
occupy the same physical space as 
him. People like Demario give me 
hope.

Dear Demario, thank you for 

being the kind and wonderful 
human that you always are. You 
and Toni have truly inspired me to 
be a better advocate and all around 
person. If not for you, I would not 
be motivated to use my voice to 
help others, because you’ve done so 
for countless individuals including 
myself.

NEEL SWAMY, 2017
Demario has been an invaluable 

presence throughout my time at The 
Michigan Daily. He is not only will-
ing to share his experiences with 
other MiC Editors in an empower-
ing way, but also demonstrates a 
fierce commitment for social justice, 
diversity and inclusion. His ability 
to identify the strengths of every-
one he works with renders him an 
amazing person to be around!

 
ADAM BRODNAX, 2017
Demario is one of those human 

beings who can beautifully make 
sense of anything. He is incredible 
at turning every conversation into 
a vulnerable shared moment where 
you feel you can be at home. One of 
the most moving moments I’ve had 
the honor to share is witnessing 
his ability to create magic spaces, 
particularly at Open MiC night this 
past winter term. He has such grace 
with his words and is able to fill any 
room with vitality and compassion. 
I am so grateful to have been able to 
share breaths with him, even with 
the short time we had. 

Demario, I wish you nothing but 

love and happiness wherever you go. 
I hope that D.C. is everything you 
need it to be and more. I am so hum-
bled to be apart of something where 
you left an indelible mark with your 
words, your soul, and your magic.

Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh led his team’s recruiting efforts at its annual ‘BBQ at the Big House’ event, helping to earn commitments from four-star offensive guard Nolan Rumler and five-star end Stephen Herron Jr.

Harbaugh, Michigan add two commitments with BBQ event

On 
Monday, 
four-star 

linebacker 
Cameron 
McGrone 

announced his commitment to 
the Michigan football program, 
becoming the 12th member of the 
Wolverines’ 2018 recruiting class.

But while many recruits in 

that cycle have yet to made their 
decisions, Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh 
is 
already 
making 

significant 
progress 
for 
the 

following year.

Harbaugh 
received 
verbal 

commitments 
from 
offensive 

tackle 
Nolan 
Rumler 
and 

defensive end Stephen Herron 
Jr., who became the second and 
third members of the now ninth-
ranked 2019 group, according to 
247Sports composite rankings. 
Four-star 
Florida 
linebacker 

Charles 
Thomas 
announced 

his attentions to play for the 
Wolverines in June.

Herron — a five-star recruit 

from Louisville, Kent. — is the 
biggest win of the past week. 
Ranked 
34th 
nationally 
and 

fourth among defensive ends, 
he chose Michigan over the 

likes of Ohio State, Alabama and 
Tennessee.

“He’s a great pickup,” said 

Steve Lorenz of 247Sports. “He’s 
what made the BBQ Weekend 
successful because the other 
two were foregone conclusions 
heading 
into 
the 
weekend. 

That’s a big win from a national 
perception in recruiting, too.”

Herron is an athletic defender 

with a quick first step that allows 
him to best offensive tackles 
off the snap. Though functional 
strength is something that he’ll 
will 
have 
to 
improve 
upon, 

Lorenz said Herron is capable of 
delivering devastating hits.

At 6’3” and 225 pounds, Herron 

is somewhere between college 
defensive ends and weakside 
linebackers in size, but that 
could work to his advantage 
in defensive coordinator Don 
Brown’s versatile schemes. For 
example, sophomore Carlo Kemp 
trained at both positions last 
season and Harbaugh mentioned 
that freshmen Kwitty Paye and 
Luiji Vilain could do the same 
during Big Ten Media Days.

“This is a staff that believes in 

what they teach and what they 
coach,” Lorenz said. “So you’ll see 
them take guys that I call ‘better 
pieces of Play Doh.’ They’re not 
molded yet, they’re not formed 
yet. 
But 
when 
they’re 
fully 

formed, their ceilings are higher 
than anybody.”

Unlike Herron, Rumler — an 

Akron, Ohio native — has long 
leaned 
the 
Wolverines’ 
way; 

both his dad and grandfather are 
Michigan alumnus. But Rumler’s 
choice is still an important one 
for Harbaugh, who has struggled 
to land recruits from Ohio.

The decision is an important 

one, as it marks the Wolverines’ 
sixth 
commitment 
since 
at 

offensive tackle — a position with 
no clear answers for the future — 
since 2017.

Rumler will look to contribute 

with 
quick 
feet, 
aggressive 

hands and technical skills in run 
blocking and pass protecting. 
Though he’s already quite strong, 
Rumler does struggle against 
heavier defense ends. According 
to scouting reports, however, 
two more years of growth in high 
school should mitigate those 

issues.

Rumler and Herron are just 

the beginning of what could be 
Harbaugh’s best recruiting class 
at Michigan — a product of a 
program-high 11 players selected 
in the 2017 NFL Draft.

“That is the year where their 

pro prospects really pay off,” 
Lorenz said. “That’s about as 
big of a recruiting pull now as 
winning a Big Ten Championship, 
in my opinion. These kids want 
to win a championship or they 
want the best chance to go to the 
NFL. Michigan is able to refine 
that (NFL) message more with 
the kids they’re just starting to 
recruit.”

Harbaugh hopes that message 

will resonate with other 2019 
class targets. Five stars running 
back 
Quavaris 
Crouch 
and 

receiver Kyle Ford both visited 
Ann Arbor last weekend and were 
impressed by the Wolverines’ 
presentation, per Lorenz.

Crouch, who rushed for 1,224 

yards and 17 touchdowns last 
year, is the class’s top-ranked 
rusher and has priority for the 
Wolverines his entire high school 

career.

That 
No. 
1 
running 
back 

distinction might cause Michigan 
fans’ eyes to roll. Najee Harris — 
2017’s top recruit — nearly signed 
with the Wolverines last year but 
ultimately stuck with his original 
choice of Alabama after a long 
recruiting saga.

But last weekend, Harbaugh 

“rolled out the red carpet” to 
ensure Crouch’s interest.

“All you can do this early with 

a kid like that is set yourself up to 
be a contender in the long term,” 
Lorenz said. “I think they did 
that and maybe a little bit more.”

Michigan hasn’t had a running 

back rush for more than 1,000 
yards since Fitzgerald Toussaint 
did so in 2011. If Crouch commits 
to the Wolverines, he could be 
the dynamic rusher Harbaugh 
has missed during his Michigan 
tenure.

“It’d be a massive pull,” Lorenz 

said. “Running back is the one 
position where they haven’t really 
hit that home run yet. Of any 
guy who visited, I’d say they’re 
happiest with the progress they 
made (with Crouch).”

Wolverines head into 2017 

with talented, deep roster

Nearly nine months after a 

penalty shot grazed off the post to 
end the Michigan women’s soccer 
season, they are set to retake the 
field as the Wolverines embark on a 
new season.

Memories of the 2-2, 5-4 penalty 

kick loss against Illinois State 
will be long in the rear view when 
Michigan takes the field for its 
exhibition opener against West 
Virginia at U-M Stadium Monday. 

And it will have to — this team is 

too talented to linger in the “what 
ifs” of 2016.

Spearheaded by a star-studded 

group 
of 
upperclassmen 
and 

supplanted by a solid crop of young 
talent, this team brims with the 
potential to exceed last year’s first 
round NCAA tournament exit — the 
first such appearance for the team 
since 2013. 

Michigan returns three of its 

top four offensive producers from 
a season ago, only losing forward 
Nicky 
Waldeck 
to 
graduation. 

Goalkeeper Sarah Jackson — who 
won Big Ten defensive player of the 
week twice last season — is also set 
to return between the posts for her 
senior campaign. Jackson posted 
six shutouts last season and finished 
fourth in the Big Ten in saves.

Jackson and senior forward 

Ani Sarkisian will be two of the 
presumed 
leaders. 
In 
addition 

to being the focal point of the 
Michigan attack, Sarkisian has 
already received the nod as a team 
captain for the second consecutive 
season. Losing Waldeck, the team’s 
leading goal scorer a year ago, will 
place much of the goal-scoring onus 
on Sarkisian, who scored six goals 
last season and was named to the 
second team all-Big Ten in her own 
right.

But Sarkisian won’t be short on 

help up top. Lost to a knee injury for 
all of 2016, redshirt junior forward 
Taylor Timko makes her triumphant 
return, and will likely assume a 
starting role. The Rochester Hills 
native netted seven goals and 
started 18 games two years ago as a 
sophomore. 

There were positives to be 

taken away from last season’s 
heartbreaking NCAA tournament 
loss. At the top of that list? The 

emergence 
of 
centerback 
Jada 

Dayne. Dayne showed a flare for the 
dramatic when she netted a second-
half equalizer in the tournament 
game, and displayed an ability as a 
dominant centerback at times last 
season. Dayne started all 19 games 
last season as a freshman for the 
Wolverines and will undoubtedly be 
counted upon to anchor a backline 
that lacks experience. 

But what it lacks in experience 

it makes up for in talent. Alongside 
Dayne, 
the 
team 
expects 
to 

get 
redshirt 
sophomore 
Sura 

Yekka back, after the Canadian 
international spent the 2016 season 
preparing for the U-20 World Cup 
for her country. Yekka played in all 
21 games in her first season with the 
program two seasons ago and was 
named to the all-Big Ten freshman 
team.

Senior defender Alyssa Dillon 

— a team captain — will likely 
compete for a starting spot despite 
playing in just 17 games in her three 
seasons with the program. Dillon 
did, however, see an uptick in her 
playing time last season, playing in 
10 games as a substitute.

But the engine of this team — as 

it was a year ago — will run through 
the midfield. A year after leading the 
team in points with 24, junior Reilly 
Martin returns as one of the premier 
players in the conference. Her 10 
assists last season were good for a 
tie atop the Big Ten. Combined with 
junior Abby Kastroll, the two make 
up one of the most talented midfield 
tandems in the country, sure to give 
the Big Ten defenses fits. Given their 
pace and creativity, both Martin and 
Kastroll figure to be potential first 
team all-Big Ten players in 2017. 
Meanwhile, 
incoming 
freshman 

midfielder Alia Martin has a chance 
to make an impact from day one. 
Martin is ranked No. 36 overall in 
the 2017 recruiting class by Top 
Drawer Soccer.

In total, the team welcomes 

11 freshmen as it replenishes the 
roster after losing seven seniors to 
graduation a year ago.

If Michigan coach Greg Ryan 

is able to find a stable backline 
to complement the plethora of 
attacking options, this figures to be 
the most talented Wolverines team 
in several years. They head into 2017 
unquestionably as one of favorites in 
a competitive Big Ten.

The string of commitments for 

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh and 
his staff continued Monday, as four-
star linebacker Cameron McGrone 
announced 
his 

intention to play for 
the Wolverines.

McGrone 
is 
the 

14th ranked outside 
linebacker in the 2018 
class, according to the 
247Sports composite 
rankings. He becomes 
the 
12th 
commit 

in Michigan’s 2018 class thus far, 
in what is widely expected to be a 
smaller class, given the larger classes 
the Wolverines took in 2016 and 2017. 
247Sports, however, actually ranks 
McGrone as the 40th best player in 
country in their own (non-composite) 
rankings, far and away his highest 
ranking among any of the major 
outlets.

McGrone held offers from a 

plethora of other Big Ten schools 
in addition to other high-majors, 
including Notre Dame and Tennessee, 
before ultimately choosing Michigan.

He is known as a speedy, athletic 

linebacker who should fit well into 

defensive coordinator Don Brown’s 
blitz-heavy scheme. Brown appears 
to have been a major factor in 
McGrone’s decision.

“Coach Brown, his knowledge of 

the game is so great,” McGrone told 
Steve Wiltfong of 247Sports. “When 

I got the offer, I sat 
down and watched 
film with him and he 
showed me exactly 
how I was going to 
play in the defense and 
I was able to visualize 
myself at the MIKE 
position.” 

In six games in his 

junior season, McGrone totaled 52 
total tackles including 15.5 tackles 
for loss. Last season, the Wolverines’ 
defense finished second in the nation 
with 121 total tackles for loss.

His commitment comes over 

ten months after McGrone tore his 
anterior cruciate ligament in his 
team’s regular season finale, though 
he has worked out in several events 
since then and attended the Michigan 
football barbeque at the Big House 
this past week. His rebound appears 
to be proceeding on schedule.

John Beilein had to replace two members of his staff this offseason after Billy Donlon and Jeff Meyer took jobs elsewhere.

Report: Michigan adds two former 
Illinois State assistants to staff 

The Michigan basketball team 

appears to have filled two vacant 
assistant coaching positions this past 
week — and both hires are from the 
same school. 

As 
first 
reported 
by 
Josh 

Henschke of The Michigan Insider 
and Brendan Quinn of The Athletic, 
Luke Yaklich and Deandre Haynes 
will both be making the move to 
Michigan from Illinois State. They 
are set to replace Billy Donlon 
and Jeff Meyer, who departed 
the program this offseason for 
jobs at Northwestern and Butler, 
respectively. The school has yet to 
confirm either hire. 

As an associate head coach this 

past season, Yaklich comes to the 
Wolverines fresh off a record-
breaking season with the Redbirds 
in which the team set a program 
record with 28 total wins. Yaklich 
spent over 10 years as a head coach 
at the high school and AAU levels 
before joining the Illinois State staff 
in 2013 as an assistant. 

Of note, the Illinois State website 

frequently attributes the team’s 
recent success in the classroom — the 
Redbirds set a program record for 
GPA last season — to Yaklich, noting 
that he was in charge of academics 
with the team. In addition, his ties 
to the AAU circuit make him a viable 

recruiter and should help replace the 
void left by Donlon and Meyer on the 
trail.

Unlike Yaklich, Haynes actually 

never coached for Illinois State, 
spending a mere two months with 
the program. Haynes most recently 
coached as an assistant at Toledo 
for one season after beginning his 
coaching career at Kent State. With 
ties to the Michigan area — Haynes 
grew up in Detroit and played at 
Southwestern High School — he 
should provide a boost in the ever-
competitive 
in-state 
recruiting 

battles.

Both Yaklich and Haynes fit the 

mold of the type of hires Michigan 
coach John Beilein makes. They’re 
both relatively young and played 
basketball collegiately — both which 
seem to be prerequisites to becoming 
an assistant coach under Beilein.

Entering the season, one of the 

major storylines will be whether 
or not the Wolverines can replicate 
their defensive improvements from 
a year ago. Donlon, brought in a 
year ago to shore up one of the worst 
defenses in the league, helped lead 
Michigan to the third-best scoring 
defense in the Big Ten last season. 
Yaklich comes to Michigan with 
a defensive background, having 
guided the Redbirds to the sixth 
best opponent effective field goal 
percentage (a metric adjusted to 

account for the value of three-point 
attempts) in the nation.

With Donlon gone, and DJ 

Wilson and Zak Irvin off to the NBA, 
Yaklich in particular could be tasked 
with maintaining the Wolverines’ 
defensive competence.

Hiring fresh staff is nothing new 

for Beilein. He has had to replace 
two assistants each of the past two 
offseasons. Meyer, in fact, will be 
joining the staff of former Wolverines 
assistant Lavall Jordan at Butler. The 
high rate of staff turnover comes 
with its positives and negatives. 

Bringing in new assistants each 

year forces an inevitable transition 
period as the players and coaches 
become 
acquainted 
with 
each 

other and the systems they are 
implementing. Having a volatile 
coaching 
staff 
also 
can 
make 

recruiting more difficult — though 
that risk is minimized as long as 
Beilein remains head coach. 

But when the younger assistants 

leave Michigan it tends to be for 
head coaching jobs or higher-profile 
gigs. This, in turn, makes Michigan 
an attractive destination for coaches 
looking for a launching pad to 
bigger jobs; an allure to good, young 
coaches even beyond Michigan’s 
natural appeal.

After the month-long search, the 

two hires have filled the coaching 
staff for the upcoming season.

Just two days after pulling 

four-star linebacker Cameron 
McGrone, 
the 
Michigan 

football team has received 
another commitment for his 
2018 recruiting 
class.

Three-star 

Naples, 
Fla. 

cornerback 
Sammy Faustin 
announced 
his 

commitment 
Wednesday 
afternoon, 
becoming 
the 

thirteenth 
recruit 
to 

join 
the 
Wolverines’ 
2018 

recruiting class.

Though he’s ranked just 

78th amongst cornerbacks and 
No. 870 nationally, Faustin has 
long-been on Michigan’s eye 
and was impressed with the 
team’s annual BBQ recruiting 
event last weekend, according 
to Steve Lorenz of 247Sports. 

“He’s a guy who (defensive 

coordinator) 
Don 
Brown 

absolutely loves — a guy the 
staff has been fighting for 

a lot,” Lorenz said. “There 
are 
other 
defensive 
backs 

Michigan is still recruiting, 
but Brown is a big advocate for 
this kid.” 

ESPN describes him as a 

“versatile defender who can 
play outside and projects as 

a free safety” 
because 
of 

“ball 
skills” 

but needs to 
improve on his 
“strength in his 
tackling 
and 

consistency 
of 
footwork.” 

Per MaxPreps, 
Faustin 
made 

39 tackles with 
an interception 

and two forced fumbles last 
season.

And at 6’2” and 170 pounds, 

Faustin has the type of frame 
that Brown looks for from 
members 
of 
his 
defensive 

backfield.

Faustin — who has offers 

from over 20 schools — is 
the 
Wolverines’ 
fourth 

commitment 
from 
a 
2018 

conerback, joining four-stars 
Myles Sims and Germon Green 
and three-star Gemon Green.
