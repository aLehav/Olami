Lin's adjustment to life in Ann
Arbor wasn't easy.
After traveling halfway
around the world to pursue a
dual degree at the University and
at Shanghai University in China,
Lin still had to learn the basics
of American culture. Every-
thing from the rules of American
sports to small talk with class-
mates was unfamiliar.
Lin is one of thousands of Chi-
nese students seeking a college
degree in the United States.
During the 2009-2010 aca-

"There's been a steady

According to a Dec. 9 article in

molecules in
DNA not rigid
By CLAIRE GOSCICKI
Daily StaffReporter
DNA, the building block of
the human genome, has the abil-
ity to change shape in unusual
ways, according to an article
published last week by Univer-

Kesearcners usea nuclear
magnetic resonance technol-
ogy, which is similar to a small-
scale MRI imaging machine,
to observe movements in indi-
vidual bases in strands of DNA.
It was then that University
researcher Hashim Al-Hashi-
mi, a University professor of
chemistry and biophysics, and
his team discovered something
strange going on.
A molecule of DNA is typi-

position of is nucieotiaes aae
nine, cytosine, guanine and thy-
mine, which are abbreviated as
A, C, G and T, respectively. The
DNA double helix resembles the
shape of a spiral staircase, but
according to the research of Al-
Hashimi and his colleagues, the
various steps of this staircase
are not rigid.

Different plans
estimated to cost
millions of dollars
By K.C.WASSMAN
Daily StaffReporter
Last night the Ann Arbor
Transit Authority held one of
a series of public meetings to
discuss its long-term vision for
transit countywide.

The focus of the meeting,
held at the Ann Arbor District
Library with about 15 people in
attendance, was to get commu-
nity input on the AATA Transit
Master Plan, a 30-year plan to
address transportation issues in
the county.
The AATA is currently con-
sidering three different plans
it could implement, according
to officials at the meeting. The
three plans under consideration
are the Lifeline Plus Scenario,

the Accessible County Scenario
and the Smart Growth Scenar-
io. Each of the plans includes
improvements to buses, inte-
grated ticketing, travel planning
programs and door-to-door ser-
vice for seniors as well as for
people with disabilities.
The AATA's decision of which
plan to adopt is expected to be
made by March or April, accord-

Blogging American values

Q: What do you teach at the Uni-
versity? How did you start teach-
ing here?
I teach about positive organiza-
tional scholarship, which I summa-
rize with three guidelines - focus on
the positive, play to your strengths
and act generously. I teach POS in
my evening MBA courses, taken by
students who are working full-time.
Each week, they discuss how they
applied the previous week's lessons
in their personal and professional
life.
Q: How did you start teaching
here?
I started teaching at the Univer-
sity in 1995 after being recruited here
from a position on the faculty at the
University of Chicago.
Q: How do you emphasize what

you've learned in your research,
and what methods do you use to
teach this information?
My research focuses on acting gen-
erously - who does it, why and under
what conditions. I teach the principle
of "pay it forward."
Q: Tell me about your blog,
OurValues.org. How did you start
writing it?
I started it in May 2008 and write
it five days a week. The blog is an
online experiment in civil dialog
about values in America. I started the
blog as a way to be disciplined about
understanding current events from a
values perspective.
Q: You've been on news talk
shows like NPR and C-SPAN.What
was it like to be on those shows,
and what did you learn from the

experience?
Radio and TV are very different
experiences from teaching in the
classroom where you have a lot of
interaction and back and forth with
your audience. With radio and TV,
you have to deliver your message one
way.
Q: What are your future plans
for your research, your blog and
your work with the University?
I plan to continue my research in
positive organizational scholarship,
especially the topic of generosity. I'm
using material from my blog to write
a new book about American values.
Q: Do you have any advice for
someone trying to start a success-
ful blog?
You have to be clear about why
you are doing a blog. Are you patient

'Jihad ane' admits
guilt in terror plot

Woman faces life
after plotting to kill
cartoonist
PHILADELPHIA (AP) - A
suburban woman who was the
live-in caretaker for her boy-
friend's elderly father calmly
told a U.S. judge yesterday that
she had worked feverishly online
under the name "Jihad Jane" to
support Islamic terrorists and
moved overseas to further her
plan to kill a Swedish artist who
had offended Muslims.
Colleen LaRose, 47, faces the
possibility of life in prison after
pleading guilty to four federal
charges, including conspiracy to
murder a foreign target, conspir-
acy to supportterrorists and lying
to the FBI.
LaRose, who spent long hours
caring for the father, also was
building a shadow life online
from 2008 to 2009. According
to prosecutors, LaRose "worked
obsessively on her computer to
communicate with, recruit and
incite other jihadists," using
screen names including "Jihad
Jane," "SisterOfTerror," and
"ExtremeSister4Life."
LaRose returned to the United
States in November 2009 and was
immediately taken into FBI cus-
tody atPhiladelphia International
Airport. She remained in secret
custody until March, when her
indictment was unsealed hours
afterIrish authorities sweptup an
alleged terror cell that included
another American women, Jamie
Paulin-Ramirez, 32, of Leadville,
Colo., and her Algerian husband.
LaRose had previously denied the
allegations against her and had
pleaded not guilty before chang-
ing her plea yesterday.
But prosecutors said LaRose
and her co-conspirators had
hoped her all-American appear-
ance and U.S. citizenship would
help her blend in while carrying
out their plans.

"Today's guilty plea, by a
woman from suburban Amer-
ica who plotted with others to
commit murder overseas and to
provide material support to ter-
rorists, underscores the evolving
nature of the threat we face," said
Assistant U.S. Attorney General
David Kris.
Speaking clearly but quietly,
the 4-foot-11 LaRose told a judge
yesterday she had never been
treated for any mental health
problems and was entering her
plea freely. She whispered a few
comments to her lawyers, some
of them prompting a smile from
public defender Mark T. Wilson.
Wilson declined to comment
afterward.
"We'll have a lot to say at sen-
tencing," he said.
LaRose and Paulin-Ramirez
are the rare U.S. women charged
with terrorism. Paulin-Ramirez
has pleaded not guilty and her
lawyer, Jeremy Ibrahim, declined
to say whether she will enter a
plea or head to trial on May 2.
However, he believes LaRose's
plea will benefit his client's case.
"With LaRose's plea it removes
some pretty prejudicial evidence
from coming in at Jamie's trial,
evidence of making plans to kill
someone, evidence of using the
Internet to recruit enemies of
America, that might otherwise
become difficult for a jury to seg-
regate in their minds who did
what," defense lawyer Ibrahim
told The Associated Press.
In e-mails recovered by the
FBI over 15 months, LaRose had
agreed to marry an online con-
tact from South Asia so he could
move to Europe. She also agreed
to become a martyr, the indict-
ment said.
Her would-be spouse directed
her in a March 2009 e-mail to
go to Sweden to find the artist,
Lars Vilks, who had depicted the
Prophet Muhammad with the
body of a dog, the indictment said.
Vilks has questioned the
sophistication of the plotters but

said he is glad LaRose never got
to him.
Both women left troubled lives
behind, LaRose having survived a
suicide attempt in Pennsburg and
Paulin-Ramirez, according to her
mother, an abusive first marriage
and a childhood marked by bully-
ing.
LaRose, born in Michigan,
moved to Texas as a girl and had
married twice by age 24. Her first
marriage came at 16, to a man
twice her age in Tarrant County,
Texas. Both unions were long
over by the time she met Pennsyl-
vanian Kurt Gorman in 2005.
LaRose lived with Gorman and
his father in Pennsburg, about an
hour northwest of Philadelphia,
caring for the older man while
Gorman worked. He called her
a "good-hearted person" who
mostly stayed around the house.
But her online ties grew to a
loose band of allegedly violent
co-conspirators from around the
world, prosecutors said. They
found her after she posted a You-
Tube video in June 2008 saying
she was "desperate to do some-
thing somehow to help" ease the
suffering of Muslims, the indict-
ment said.
Despite Web images that show
LaRose in a Muslim head cover-
ing, Gorman said he never picked
up on any Muslim leanings. She
did not attended religious ser-
vices of any kind, he said. Gorman
said he sensed nothing amiss in
their five-year relationship -
until LaRose fled days after his
father's funeral.
LaRose had removed the hard
drive from her computer and set
off for Europe, according to the
indictment. She had swiped Gor-
man's passport and planned to
give it to the co-conspirator she
had agreed to marry, the indict-
ment said.
It's unclear how she was able
to travel overseas, given that the
FBI, presumably tipped to her
online postings, had interviewed
her in July 2009.

Australia prepares as 'life-
threatening' cyclone builds

Gusts of wind up to
186 mph expected
in Category 5 storm
CAIRNS, Australia (AP) -
Authorities implored thousands
of Australians to gather their
loved ones today and flee a mon-
ster cyclone that strengthened
overnight and threatened to pro-
duce hours of terrifying winds
and torrential rain for the north-
east.
Gusts up to 186 mph (300 kph)
were expected when Cyclone
Yasi strikes late tonight as a
fierce Category 5 storm - the
most severe threat level. The
storm front is more than 310
miles (500 kilometers) wide and
Yasi is so strong, it could reach
far inland before it significantly
loses power.
Queensland Premier Anna
Bligh urged people living in low-
lying areas to get out quickly
because roads and airports were
within hours of closing.
"Do not bother to pack bags.
Just grab each other and get to
a place of safety. Remember that
people are irreplaceable," she
said.

Yasi was forecast to hit land
at about 10 p.m. tonight (7 a.m.
EST, 1200 GMT), the Bureau of
Meteorology said.
The timing, just after high
tide, meant high storm surges of
at least 6.5 feet (two meters) were
likely to flood significant areas
alongthe coast.
"Yasi ... poses an extremely
serious threat to life and prop-
erty," the bureau warned, add-
ing that the storm is likely to be
"more life-threatening than any
experienced in recent genera-
tions."
Bligh said residents in coastal
areas should have left already as
their region would undoubtedly
flood. Those livingfurther inland
were told to "bunker down" in
their homes and get ready for
gale-force winds expected to hit
within hours.
"We are facinga storm of cata-
strophic proportions in a highly
populated area," Bligh said.
"What it all adds up to is a very
frightening time. We're looking
at 24 hours of quite terrifying
winds, torrential rain, likely loss
of electricity and mobile phones.
People really need to be prepar-
ing mentally if nothing else."
The storm is expected to make

landfall between Cairns - a city
of about 164,000 people and a
gateway for visitors to the Great
Barrier Reef - and Innisfail, a
rural community about 60 miles
(100 kilometers) south, which
was devastated by Cyclone Larry
in 2006. Larry destroyed thou-
sands of homes and banana and
sugar cane plantations. No one
was killed.
The Cairns airport closed
today after extra morning
flights left. Tourists fled beach
resorts ranging from backpack-
er hostels to exclusive clubs,
and military flights ferried the
ill and elderly from hospitals
to safety farther south. About
9,500 people had taken cover at
evacuation centers by this after-
noon, Bligh said.
Police began ordering people
off the streets of Cairns early
Wednesday morning. "Every-
one's gotta go now," one officer
told pedestrians strolling near
the waterfront. "The water is
coming NOW."
Those who decided to weather
the storm fromtheir homes spent
Wednesday morning taping up
windows, stacking sandbags and
tryingto stay calm as the massive
storm front edged closer.

MORENCI, Mich.
Kidnapping case
to be investigated
as homicide
The disappearance of three
young Michigan brothers has
turned into a homicide investiga-
tion, a police chief said yesterday,
dashing hopes that the boys who
were last seen with their father
at Thanksgiving are safe some-
where.
Morenci Chief Larry Weeks
is now asking people in the area,
along the Michigan-Ohio border,
to be on the lookout for bodies. He
said investigators have followed
up on 900 tips but they have not
* been fruitful.
"We've seen false hope contin-
ue to grow," he told reporters.
Weeks said the boys' father,
John Skelton, is the primary focus
of the investigation, although no
new charges have been filed. Skel-
ton already has been charged with
parental kidnapping and is being
held on a $30 million bond.

Bush daughter OK
with gay marriage
Former President George W.
Bush's daughter Barbara has

unions.
The Human Rights Campaign,
a national gay rights organization,
released a video yesterday featur-
ing the 29-year old Bush, a New
York resident who runs Global
Health Corps, a nonprofit public
health organization.
"I'm a New Yorker for marriage
equality," Bush says in the video.
"New York is about fairness and
equality and everyone should have
the right to marry the person that
they love."

Muslim leaders
visit Auschwitz
In a bid to fight anti-Semitism
and bridge cultural rifts, a large
delegation of Muslim dignitaries
visited Auschwitz yesterday to
pay tribute to the millions of Jews
and others who were systemati-
cally killed in the Holocaust.
The group of some 150 people
included representatives from
Morocco, Jordan, Turkey and
Iraq, as well as rabbis, Holocaust
survivors and Christian repre-
sentatives. Several European
dignitaries also were part of the
group, including the former Ger-
man Chancellor Gerhard Schro-
eder.
"Muslims have to stand up
with Jewish friends because in
Europe, anti-Semitism is rising -
and where there is anti-Semitism,
Islamophobia is not far away,"
said British Mufti Abduljalil
Sajid.
Sajid said he knew of the Holo-
caust from books and movies but

that it was his first visit to Aus-
chwitz. "I wanted to see it with
my own eyes - and teach others
about the evil of hate," he said.
"This should never happen again,
to anybody."
BEIRUT
Syrians organize
protest on Twitter
Syrians are organizing cam-
paigns on Facebook and Twit-
ter that call for a "day of rage" in
Damascus this week, taking inspi-
ration from Egypt and Tunisia in
using social networking sites to
rally their followers for sweeping
political reforms.
Like Egypt and Tunisia, Syria
suffers from corruption, poverty
and unemployment. All three
nations have seen subsidy cuts on
staples like bread and oil. Syria's
authoritarian president has resist-
ed calls for political freedoms and
jailed critics of his regime.
The main Syrian protest page
on Facebook is urging people to
protest in Damascus on Feb. 4 and
5 for "a day of rage." It says the goal
is to "end the state of emergency in
Syria and end corruption."

not to seek re-election, but that
did not calm public fury as clash-
es erupted between his opponents
and supporters.
The protesters, whose num-
bers multiplied more than tenfold
in a single day yesterday for their
biggest rally yet, have insisted
they will not end their unprec-
edented week-old wave of unrest
until their ruler for nearly three
decades goes.
Mubarak's halfway concession
- an end to his rule seven months
down the road - threatened to
inflame frustration and anger
among protesters, who have been
peaceful in recent days.
In the Mediterranean city
of Alexandria, clashes erupted
between several hundred pro-
testers and government support-
ers soon afterward, according to
footage by Al-Jazeera television.
The protesters threw stones at
their rivals, who wielded knives
and sticks, until soldiers fired in
the air and stepped in between
them, said a local journalist, Hos-
sam el-Wakil.
The speech was immediately
derided by protesters in Cairo's
Tahrir Square. Watching on a
giant TV, protesters booed and
waved their shoes over their
heads at his image in a sign of
contempt. "Go, go, go! We are
not leaving until he leaves," they
chanted. One man screamed, "He
doesn't want to say it, he doesn't
want to say it."
In the 10-minute address, the
82-year-old Mubarak appeared
somber but spoke firmly and

without an air of defeat. He insist-
ed that even if the protests had
never happened, he would not
have sought a sixth term in Sep-
tember.
He said he would serve out
the rest of his term working
"to accomplish the necessary
steps for the peaceful transfer of
power." He said he will carry out
amendments to rules on presiden-
tial elections.
Mubarak, a former air force
commander, vowed not to flee the
country. "This is my dear home-
land ... I have lived in it, I fought
for it and defended its soil, sov-
ereignty and interests. On its soil
I will die. History will judge me
and all of us."
The step came after heavy pres-
sure from his top ally, the United
States. Soon after Mubarak's
address, President Barack Obama
said at the White House that he
had spoken with Mubarak and
"he recognizes that the status quo
is not sustainable and a change
must take place." Obama said
he told Mubarak that an orderly
transition must be meaningful
and peaceful, must begin now and
must include opposition parties.
Earlier, a visiting Obama envoy
- former ambassador to Egypt
Frank Wisner, who is a friend of
the Egyptian president - met
with Mubarak and made clear to
him that it is the U.S. "view that
his tenure as president is coming
to a close," according to an admin-
istration official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity because
of the delicacy of the ongoing
diplomacy.
The United States has been
struggling to find a way to ease
Mubarak out of office while
maintaining stability in Egypt, a
key ally in the Mideast that has
a 30-year-old peace treaty with
Israel and has been a bulwark
against Islamic militancy.
Mubarak would be the second
Arab leader pushed from office

tory of the modern Middle East,

er North African nation.
The U.S. ambassador in Cairo,
Margaret Scobey, spoke by tele-
phone yesterday with Nobel
Peace laureate Mohamed EBara-
dei;the embassy said. ElBaradei, a
pro-democracy advocate and one
of the opposition's most promi-
nent leaders, has taken a key role
in formulating the movement's
demands. He is also a member of
a new committee formed by vari-
ous factions to conduct any future
negotiations on the protesters'
behalf once Mubarak steps down.
There was no immediate word
on what he and Scobey discussed.
Only a month ago, reform
activists would have greeted
Mubarak's announcement with
joy - many Egyptians believed
Mubarak was going to run again
despite healthissues. But afterthe
past week of upheaval, Mubarak's
address struck many of his oppo-
nents as inadequate.
"The people have spoken. They
said no to Mubarak, and they will
not go back on their words," said
Saad el-Katatni, a leading mem-
ber of the fundamentalist Muslim

Brotherhood. "Enough suffering.
Let him go, and leave the Egyp-
tians to sort themselves out."
Ayman Nour, a former presi-
dential candidate who is a mem-
ber of the negotiating committee,
said Mubarak clearly didn't get
the message.
"This is a unique case of stub-
bornness that will end in a disas-
ter," he said. "It is only expected
that he wasn't going to run
because of his age.... He offered
nothing new."
Yesterday's protest marked a
dramatic escalation that organiz-
ers said aims to drive Mubarak
out by Friday, with more than
250,000 people flooding into
Tahrir, or Liberation, Square.
Protesters jammed in shoulder
to shoulder: farmers and unem-
ployed university graduates,
women in conservative heads-
carves and women in high heels,
men in suits and working-class
men in scuffed shoes. Many in
the crowd traveled from rural
provinces, defying a government
transportation shutdown and
roadblocks on intercity highways.

They sang nationalist songs,
danced, beat drums and chanted
the anti-Mubarak slogan "Leave!
Leave! Leave!" as military heli-
copters buzzed overhead. Similar
demonstrations erupted in at least
five other cities around Egypt.
Solldiers at checkpoints set up
at the entrances of the square did
nothing to stop the crowds from
entering. The military promised
on state TV Monday night that
it would not fire on protesters
answering a call for a million to
demonstrate, a sign that army
support for Mubarak may be
unraveling.
The movement to drive
Mubarak out has been built on
the work of online activists and
fueled by deep frustration with
an autocratic regime blamed for
ignoringthe needs of the poorand
allowing corruption and official
abuse to run rampant. After years
of tight state control, protest-
ers emboldened by the Tunisia
unrest took to the streets on Jan.
25 and mounted a once-unimagi-
nable series of protests across this
nation of 80 million.

Lawmakers: US-Canadian
border needs to be secured

Report: Terrorists
could enter U.S.
from Canada
AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) - Less
than 1 percent of the 4,000-mile
.U.S.-Canada border is considered
under the operational control of
U.S. border officials, according
to a report released yesterday by
the Government Accountability
Office.
"To me this report is absolute-
ly alarming," said U.S. Sen. Joe
Lieberman, I-Conn., chairman
of the Senate Homeland Security
and Government Affairs Com-
mittee, noting that there is more
known terrorist activity in Can-
ada than Mexico. "GAO makes
clear defense of our northern bor-
der is weak."
Crossers include people seek-
ing to immigrate illegally, crimi-
nals trafficking humans and
smuggling drugs, and, potential-
ly, terrorists, said U.S. Sen. Susan
Collins, R-Maine, who released
the report with Lieberman.
The GAO report says Customs
and Border Protection believes it

can detectillegal entries, respond
and deal with them on only about
32 miles of the northern border. It
says the Border Patrol was aware
of all illegal border crossings on
only 25 percent of the border, or
1,007 out of 4,000 miles.
Most areas of the northern
border are remote and inaccessi-
ble by traditional patrol methods,
the report said.
"Few northern border miles
had reached an acceptable level
of security as of fiscal year end
2010," said the report, citing Bor-
der Patrol security assessments.
It also found that illegal crossings
by terrorists are more likely along
the northernborder thantheyare
across the southernborder.
Collins said the Department
of Homeland Security allocates
increasing amounts of money to
the southern border "to the detri-
ment of the northernborder." The
money helps coordinate the fed-
eral government's border secu-
rity efforts with state, local and
tribal law enforcement agencies.
"Itisveryclearfromthisreport
that the United States remains
very vulnerable," said Collins,
who called the report shocking.

Roger Stockham, was arrested outside the the Islamic Center of America mosque in Dearborn, Mich., shown here.
Man who tried to blow up
mosque has criminal past

Suspect tried to
detonate Dearborn
mosque last week
DETROIT (AP) - A Califor-
nia man accused of threatening
to blow up a popular Detroit-
area mosque has had several
violent, unpredictable run-ins
with the law dating back to the
1970s, including one in which he
kidnapped his son from a foster
home and crashed a plane while
tryingto get away.
Roger Stockham, 63, has twice
been committed for psychiatric
treatment by the courts, and his
attorney, Mark Haidar, told The
Associated Press yesterday that
after meeting with Stockham
earlier in the day, he came away
worried about his client's mental
state.
"He indicated he never meant
to hurt anyone at any time and
had no intention of blowing up
any mosque at any time," Haidar
said of Stockham, who has been
living in Imperial Beach, Calif.
Stockham was arrested dur-
ing a Jan. 24 traffic stop near
the Islamic Center of America
in Dearborn, which is one of the

nation's largest mosques and
serves the area's huge Arab com-
munity. Police kept quiet about
Stockham's arrest for a week
after consulting with Islamic
leaders who were worried about
possible copycat attempts.
Hours before his arrest, wit-
nesses say Stockham sipped
Scotch at a nearby sports bar and
bragged about how he was going
to cause a big explosion. Police
say when the pulled him over,
he was wearing a ski mask and
had more than two dozen Class-
C fireworks in his car, including
M-80s, which are illegal in the
state.
Haidar said he hasn't
reviewed the evidence, buttbased
on Stockham's history of mental
illness he will request a compe-
tency evaluation for him during
Friday's scheduled preliminary
examination in Dearborn's dis-
trict court.
Police have not discussed why
they believe Stockham may have
targeted the Dearborn mosque.
Joe Nahhas, a manager at the
Detroit bar Stockham alleg-
edly visited before his arrest,
said Stockham claimed to have
become a Muslim after returning
from the Vietnam War, and said

he recognized that Stockham
could speak at least some Arabic.
He also said Stockham claimed to
be part of a group of Indonesian
mujahedeen, or holy warriors.
The fireworks, as described by
police, could not have destroyed
a building, but they could have
been used to wound or kill peo-
ple, said John V. Goodpaster, an
explosives expert and assistant
professor at Indiana University-
Purdue University Indianapolis.
Federal authorities said that
was not the case in June 1985,
when they said Stockham planted
a bomb in a Reno, Nev., airport
garbage can, then called the Reno
Gazette-Journal and the FBI to
tell them about it. The airport
was evacuated and the device was
disarmed, but bomb experts said
that it could have killed anyone in
the vicinity had it exploded.
Stockham was convicted of
one count each of attempting
to damage a building used in
interstate commerce and pos-
sessing an unregistered firearm,
and was sentenced to 10 years in
prison for each count, with the
counts to run concurrently. It
was not immediately clear when
and under what terms Stockham
was released.

A plan in motion
AATA should consider 'U' transportation needs
ublic transportation around Ann Arbor and the Detroit area
could potentially get a much-needed face-lift in the coming
years. The Ann Arbor Transit Authority has released three
options for new mass transit plans, which include adjustments to
public transportation options throughout Ann Arbor and a "smart
growth" plan that would incorporate travel between Ann Arbor,
Detroit and the surrounding areas. When discussing the proposals,
the AATA should aim to improve public transportation and infra-
structure around campus and the Ann Arbor area. Members of the
community should also utilize the environmentally-friendly transit
options once they become available.

neering housemates might

And with all WOJCIK
respect to the
No. 7 under-
graduate engineering program in
the country, I am glad I am a stu-
dent in the College of Literature,
Science and the Arts.
U.S. News and World Report
stated that for 2010, 67 LSA depart-
ments are in the top 10 in the coun-
try, and nine departments ranked
No. 1 in the country. All around us
is academic excellence, and we will
reap the benefits years from now
when we are curing diseases, end-
ing world famine and producing
award-winning films. But while
our faculty is top-notch and our
academic playground is engaging,
sometimes our departments inter-
act with us students in ways that
leave us scratching our heads.
Some departments give their
concentrators weekly newsletters
with summaries, helpful resources
and important reminders. Yet oth-
ers contact their concentrators at
random, with little productive use
of their undergraduate listserv.
Many departments have student
clubs and peer advisers, which pro-
vide a sense of community to stu-
dents who share a major or minor.
But other departments don't pro-
vide these venues and connections
for undergraduates. As students,
we need to help develop our depart-
ments to better cater to our needs.
We need to partner with schools to

improve our top-ranked programs
and make the best departments
even better.
The idea is to find the leading
practices in LSA departments and
help apply those ideas to depart-
ments that are struggling to pro-
vide all they can to students. We
want to find the best things that
our nationally-recognized depart-,
ments are doing and convince other
departments to follow their lead.
We need your help to do this.
Last semester, LSA Student Gov-
ernment started the Concentration
Council - a group of students who
serve as liaisons and representa-
tives between their department and
the student body. One or two stu-
dents from each department join
other representatives to discuss the
strengths and weaknesses of their
concentrations and determine which
departments are the mostsuccessful.
Using a variety of metrics like advis-
ing, course offerings, community
building and resource creation, the
organization evaluates the good and
bad aspects of every corner of LSA
and works to find solutions to the
concerns in each department. The
representatives then return to their
departments to discuss ideas and
solutions to improve the experience
of undergraduates in their major and
in LSA. We are doing this because
students are the ones who know
what areas need improvement and
which ones are working well. LSA is
incredibly supportive of our efforts,
and many in the dean's office are
also lookingto find the best practices
in LSA. But it's the undergraduates
who should be making the changes in
the college.
In just the last two months of
the fall 2010 semester, LSA under-
graduate students came together
and reworked the way departments
communicate with their concentra-
tors. This semester, several depart-

ments have started a newsletter for
their concentrators. Additionally,
a new department tool was created
through work with the Newnan
Academic Advising Center to help
departments learn how their con-
centrators engage and perceive the
department's work. In the com-
ing weeks we will be developing
a peer mentorship program that
all departments can use to better
interact with concentrators and
streamline the way students con-
nect with tutoring resources. We'll
also be pushing for all LSA units
to use the Online Advising Report
system to help students travel from
adviser to adviser and keep track of
their relationship with the advising
system.
Students should
help to make
changes in LSA.
We are currently seeking inter-
ested students to help advance the
mission of the council and improve
the academic resources provided by
LSA departments. To apply, please
go to sitemaker.umich.edu/lsas-
gconcentrationcouncil and tell us
about your interest in improving
your department and LSA. You will
work with other like-minded stu-
dents to find the solutions to prob-
lems in your departments. Let's
make this place even better.
By the way, engineers, if you'd
like to help us out, please let us
know.

According to a Jan. 27 AnnArbor.com arti-
cle, the plans currently being reviewed aim to
improve public transportation not only within
Ann Arbor, but also between surrounding cit-
ies. Each of the 30-year plans - which will be
voted on in March - include a shuttle service
from Detroit Metro Airport to cities in Washt-
enaw County. Smart Growth - the most com-
prehensive of the three mass transit proposals
- willfurther increase the availability of pub-
lic transportation between Ann Arbor and
cities in the metro Detroit area. The AATA
released estimates this week that state that
the cost of the new services range from $120
million to $566 million, according to a Jan.
31 AnnArbor.com article. Last night, AATA
project coordinators met with community
members at the Ann Arbor District Library to
discuss the proposed changes.
In the Smart Growth proposal, the AATA
laid out plans to build a high-capacity tran-
sit system,!create "high frequency" services
within the most active areas in the county and
listed street cars, trams and rapid bus transit
as possible options. These services would cut
wait times for passengers and increase avail-
able transportation within cities. It's current-
ly an expensive struggle for people without
a car, or those who are trying to avoid using
their car to get to the Detroit Metro Airport,
and these updates could hugely expedite that
process. While also keeping cost in mind, the
AATA should consider a plan that will help

connect Ann Arbor with surrounding cities.
The selected plan also needs to explicitly
address the needs of University students and
provide on-going transportation between
campus and the Ann Arbor area. It's not very
easy to get around Ann Arbor without a car
- which many students don't have - and the
AATA needs to approve a plan that addresses
that concern. By providing students ample
travel options, the AATA can make getting
around campus easier, while also reducing the
environmental impact of people on campus.
Once a plan is finalized, students and Ann
Arbor residents need to take advantage of the
comprehensive transit system. According to
AATA Project Coordinator Michael Benham,
the current transit mode share - the percent-
age of public transportation used compared to
other vehicles in Ann Arbor - is at a mere 6.2
percent. With the increase in available pub-
lic transit, along with proposed expansion of
carpool programs and bike paths,Washtenaw
County commuters, including University
students, need to reduce their dependency
on cars and utilize more eco-friendly travel
options.
With an end to the county-wide debate
over the ideal transit plan in sight, the AATA
should consider the transportation needs
of students. In turn, students must also take
advantage of the 'green' transit options avail-
able and restrict use of gas-guzzling cars in
favor of public transportation.

was once told that C's get
degrees. It's a common adage
that fills any student who
receives a less-
than-satisfac-
tory grade with
a glimmer of
hope. It reminds
students that
life as we know
it doesn't begin'
and end with a
grade point aver- JOE
age, and it grants SUGIYAMA
some humor to
an extraordinary
not funny situation. Getting a D is
another story. A story that usually
ends by retaking a class that you've
already learned to hate. There aren't
many words of compassion for
someone who's come to the conclu-
sion that summer term is the only
plausible way to graduate on time.
I guess taking a summer course
isn't the end of the world - just
the end of some of your parent's
hard-earned money - and it forces
unlucky students to count their
blessings as they get a second chance.
Colleges have built this re-do system
into their infrastructure to keep the
checks coming in and allow students
to accomplish their ultimate goal of
getting a degree. The infrastructure
of the United States may needa simi-
lar get-out-of-jail-free card - minus
the "free" part.
In President Barack Obama's
State of the Union address last
week, he informed America that
our infrastructure is crumbling
- literally. Roads, bridges, trans-
portation systems, drinking water
systems and our methods of deliv-
ering energy have been scrutinized
by the American Society of Civil

Engineers in its annual infrastruc-
ture report card. The ASCE is the
authority on infrastructure in the
U.S. and has given us an overall
grade of a D. But what exactly does
that grade mean?
It means that given the current
state of our infrastructure, our sys-
tems will begin to fail in the very
near future. It means that the esti-
mated lifetime of structures, like
dams and bridges, are coming to an
end. It means that America will need
a facelift for the ages on pretty much
everything we have come to rely on.
Through research and studies,
the ASCE has decided that in order
to prevent our country from falling
apart around us, an estimated $2.2
trillion investment is needed over
the next five years. Though this
egregious sum isn't quite equitable
to a semester's tuition, infrastruc-
ture is a required course in just
about every country.
I'll admit that majoring in civil
engineering has made me a bit biased
- if Obama wanted to give your pro-
fession $2.2 trillion you'd be jump-
ing for joy as well - but that doesn't
mean that my vision is clouded by job
prospects. This problem is about as
serious as they come and letting this
information pass by is simply not an
option for a variety of reasons.
Drinking water systems - receiv-
ing a D-, the lowest grade in the
study - are becoming obsolete. The
life expectancy of many water plants
is shortening and leaking pipes are
losing about 7 billion gallons of clean
drinking water a day. Soon, the cost
of cleaning and transporting drink-
ing water will be more than the allot-
ted funding needed to keep systems
running.
Roads received a D-, based on

quality and traffic congestion, and
there aren't many residents in Michi-
gan who would argue with that
grade. The ASCE estimates that one-
third of our roads need repair, and
traffic congestion costs Americans
about 4.2 billion hours a year of sit-
ting mindlessly in traffic. I don't
know about you, but that's about 4.2
billion more hours of radio-broad-
casted Ke$ha than Americans want
to listen to.
D grades
aren't acceptable
for America.
I could go on with this list for
another 700 words. The statistics
are equally alarming for each of the
15 categories that the ASCE investi-
gated, and each grade raises the same
question of how these problems are
going to be fixed.
The ASCE has determined that
addressing these issues will require
America to increase federal leader-
ship, promote sustainable systems
that can stand the test of time, devel-
op plans to implement these new
systems, figure out what it will take
to stop the crumbling process and
- of course - find a way to come up
with the $2.2 trillion needed. It will
be an arduous journey, but without a
well-engineered plan for our infra-
structural future, we could be in for
a bumpy ride - literally.

STUDENTS
From Page 1A
in the state of Michigan are Chi-
nese.
The University's long history
of accommodating international
students has helped it establish a
strong reputation abroad, Greis-
berger said.
"We've always had high num-
bers of international (Chinese)
students," Greisberger said.
"Word spreads when people tell
their friends and family."
Lin said he chose to come to
the University based on informa-
tion from alumni.
"A lot of people study at Michi-
gan, and they give positive feed-
back," Lin said. "We all agree
that it is a great place for us to
study and explore life."
Peggy Blumenthal, senior
counselor of the Institute of
International Education, wrote
in an e-mail interview that as
education becomes more acces-
sible to students in countries like
China and India, these nations
face difficulty in accommodating
the growing number of under-
graduates. For students com-
ing to the United States from
these countries, Peggy wrote,
that America offers hands-on
research opportunities and
alternative teaching approaches.
"It's not rote learning; it's
much more interdisciplinary and
participatory and stresses criti-
cal thinking," Blumenthal wrote.
Lin said getting an education
in engineering abroad offers the
opportunity to study more mod-
ern concepts.
"The quality of this education
is better than many Chinese uni-
versities, so it's good for me," he
said.
LSA and Business senior
Chenli Zhu said she chose

to study abroad because she
thought it would lead to more
future employment opportuni-
ties.
"I think this education is more
valued in Asia than (going to) a
university in (a student's) home
country," she said.
For these students looking
for a high-quality education at a
competitive price, the University
is an optimal choice, Greisberger
said.
But once students are on cam-
pus, they are often met by an
overwhelming culture shock. As
Lin pointed out, though his expe-
rience at the University has been
positive, he said the challenge of
acclimating was daunting.
In order to combat this obsta-
cle, orientations and programs at
the University help international
students. And these programs
reach beyond the walls of the
International Center, Greisberg-
er said.
"It really is a campus-wide
effort. It's not just one office
working to make these students
feel comfortable," he said.
Additionally, many student
organizations help to bridge the
cultural gap that spans halfway
around the world. Because of
the large international Chinese
population on campus, several
clubs and groups have surfaced
with an agenda that aids in the
transition to life at an American
university.
Groups including the Chinese
Students Association, the Asso-
ciation for Chinese Economic
Development, the China Entre-
preneur Network and the Michi-
gan China Fellows, help to form
a strong community within the
University that includes Chi-
nese-American and internation-
al Chinese students.
Zhu, a member of the Asso-
ciation for Chinese Economic

Development, said the organi-
zation succeeds in bringing stu-
dents together.
"I think we build a strong
close-knit group," she said.
Lin works with the Shanghai
Jiao Tong University Alumni
Association, which sponsors
social events on the University
of Michigan campus that bring
students together and help them
adjust to life abroad. To make
students feel more comfortable
with a new culture, the organi-
zation holds lectures on topics
ranging from the rules of Ameri-
can football to where to dine out
with friends.
"(American students) talk in
different ways, and students can-
not always get close with them
and talk comfortably," Lin said.
"We use these activities to let
Chinese students explore more
with their foreign friends."
The University also has a part-
nership with SJTU in the form of
a Joint Institute in Engineering.
The joint venture was created
when University President Mary
Sue Coleman went to China in
2005.
As part of other efforts to link
the University to Chinese orga-
nizations, the University created
a Confucius Institute in Novem-
ber 2009. The institute is one
component of Coleman's Task
Force on China, which was start-
ed in 2005. The goal of the task
force is to strengthen the con-
nection between the University
and China.
"Our relationship with China
goes back so far, to (former
University) President (James)
Angell," Coleman said in 2009,
referring to Angell's time in
China from 1880-1881, when he
took a hiatus from the University
to be the U.S. minister to China.
Though some national media
outlets have raised the concern

that the large number of Chinese
students in America is creating a
"pipeline" system rather than an
international network, Blumen-
thal wrote that she isn't aware of
any problems.
"While the number ofstudents
from China has grown rapidly,
international students still make
up a very small proportion of col-
lege and university students, so
the U.S. system has the capacity
for more international students,
from China and elsewhere," she
wrote.
Though Greisberger acknowl-
edged that no campus would
want to be overly dependent on
one country's student popula-
tion, he said it's not a cause for
concern at the University.
"It's true that we have a large
number of Chinese students, but
we have a lot of students from
other areas as well," he said,
Overall, the influx of Chi-
nese students contributes to the
United States's national agenda
of building global networks,
according to Blumenthal.
"Many linkages and col-
laborative research efforts .re
emerging from linkages between
American and Chinese higher
education institutions," she
wrote.
Blumenthal wrote that the
feedback from campuses across
the country has been over-
whelmingly positive.
"The Chinese students that
come to the U.S. are the best of
the best," she wrote. "And they
help to internationalize U.S.
classrooms."
International students offer
a global experience to mem-
bers of the American population
who are unable to travel abroad,
Greisberger said.
"You can benefit from a world
perspective while staying right
here on campus," he said.


DNA
From Page 1A
Professor of Chemistry, worked
with Rackham graduate student
Evgenia Nikoliva, LSA senior
Abigail Wise, Patrick O'Brien, an
assistant professor of biological
chemistry at the University, and
colleagues from the University of
California-Irvine, to determine
these findings.
"Using the NMR technol-
ogy was like having the first tele-
scope, but rather than looking at
the universe, we were looking at
movements in small molecules,"
Al-Hashimi said. "We observed
clearly that the G and A (nucle-

otides) in the base pairs were
doing something funny, moving
in away that was quite dramatic."
These movements turned out
to be 180 degree rotations, Al-
Hashimi said.
The new positioning of the
nucleotides classifies them as
Hoogsteenbasepairs,whichhave
only previously been observed in
damaged DNA or DNA proteins
bound to molecules or drugs,
Al-Hashimi said. Typical base
pairs are called Watson-Crick
base pairs, named after the scien-
tists James Watson and Francis
Crick, who discovered DNA in
the 1950s.
According to Hashimi, the rev-
elations could bring up new ideas

about how DNA can store differ-
ent types of genetic information.
For Nikolova, the findings
were startling.
"We had no pre-conceived
notion that we would discover
something like this," she said.
"We were looking for interesting
aspects of sequences ... and we
kind of came upon this."
Though slight "gyration"
of the DNA molecules in their
respective positions can occur,
the bases have generally been
thought to remain stable, accord-
ing to a University press release
about Al-Hashimi and Nikolova's
findings.
By showing that bases can
rotate, AI-Hashimi and his col-

leagues have opened the door to
further study on the alternative
pairings of DNA.
Structural changes that may
occur around the Hoogsteen base
pairs warrants further explora-
tion, Nikolova said.
"The formation of one (Hoog-
steen base pair) can facilitate the
formation of another chainosear-
by,' she said.
Al-Hashimi also said if DNA
is put under enough stress, the
alternative form could become
the standard form in the base
pairs.
"I think that generally, now
whenever we look at a structure,
we'll have to be wondering if
there's an alternative," he said.


TRANSIT

tions. The AATA Board of Direc-
tors will decide between the
three plans based on the com-
munity feedback received at this
and forthcoming public meet-
ings, Stasiak said.
Each of the three plans has a
different set of features.
The Lifeline Plus Scenario
- projected to cost $48 mil-
lion - features improvements
in the urban bus network, Ann
Arbor bus stops and the creation
of countywide transit hubs in
Chelsea and Dexter, Mich.
The Accessible County Sce-
nario, estimated to cost $51

million, includes all the same
features as the Lifeline Plus,
but adds bus circulation in Dex-
ter and Saline, Mich., as well
as countywide transit hubs in
three more Washtenaw County
cities - Manchester, Milan and
Whitmore Lake. It also includes
five countywide express servic-
es between the transit hubs.
The third plan, the Smart
Growth Scenario, includes
everything in the other two
plans, and will add regional
rail services and High Capac-
ity Transit services including
an Ann Arbor connection to
the Detroit Metro Airport. At
an estimated $465 million, the
Smart Growth Scenario is the
most costly plan.

At last night's meeting, some
of the community contributors
seemed skeptical of the Smart
Growth Scenario because of its
complexity.
Rackham student Prashanth
Gururaja attended the meeting
and expressed his reserved sup-
port for the Smart Growth Sce-
nario.
"I am partial to the Smart
Growth plan," Gururaja said.
"It seems like there is a sticker
shock, but if there's a cohesive
payment plan I think it will
work."
Ann Arbor resident Dan Cor-
win, who attended the meeting,
said he prefers the Lifeline Plus
Scenario but would like to see
other changes about the busing

system added to the plan.
"I think the cheapest one is
best, though I see the benefit of
a railway," Corwin said. "What
I'd really like to see is increased
nighttime and weekend routes."
Yuri Popov, a physics lec-
turer at the University, said he
favors the Lifeline Plus with
three additional changes that he
believes should be implemented
immediately. He said he thinks"
the AATA should add weekend
routes, an airport shuttle and
transportation to Detroit.
"It seems kind of obvious."
Popov said. "The airport is half
hour away, and there are no air-
port buses. Detroit is 40 miles
away and there is no way to get
to Detroit."

House GOP readies restrictions on EPA

Imminent bill
aims to nullify
EPA measures on
greenhouse gases
WASHINGTON (AP) - In a
sharp challenge to the Obama
administration, House Republi-
cans intend to unveil legislation
today to ban the Environmental
Protection Agency from regu-
lating greenhouse gases under
the Clean Air Act and expect to
advance the bill quickly, officials
disclosed last night.
The officials said the bill would
nullify all of the steps the EPA
has taken to date on the issue,
including a threshold finding
that greenhouse gases constitute
a danger to the public health and
welfare.
In addition, it seeks to strip
the agency of its authority to use
the law in any future attempts
to crack down on the emissions
from factories, utilities and other

stationary sources.
Many scientists say that carbon
dioxide and other heat-trapping
pollution contribute to global
warming,.and attempts at regu-
lating them is a major priority
for President Barack Obama as
well as environmentalists. Crit-
ics argue the evidence is thin and
that new rules will drive up the
cost of business and cause the loss
of jobs.
The officials who described
the GOP plans did so on condi-
tion of anonymity, saying they
were not authorized to pre-empt
the release of a draft measure
prepared by the Energy and Com-
merce Committee, chaired by
Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan.
The legislation marks yet
another arena in which newly
empowered House Republicans
are moving quickly to challenge
the administration.
Sworn into office less than
a month ago, the House has
already voted to repeal last year's
health care law and is advanc-
ing toward a series of expected

confrontations with Obama over
Republican demands for deep
spendingcuts. In addition, Speak-
er John Boehner, R-Ohio, recently
announced support for legislation
to restrict abortions.
Avote on the greenhouse gases
bill would occur first in the Ener-
gy and Commerce Committee,
and is expected later this winter.
The measure would then go to the
House floor, where Republicans
express confidence they have a
strong enough majority to over-
come objections by Democrats,
many of whom are expected
to oppose it on environmental
grounds.
Republicans are attempting
similar restrictions in the Sen-
ate, where the Democrats are in
a majority and the political situ-
ation is more complicated. Sen.
John Barrasso of Wyoming has
introduced a more sweeping mea-
sure than the one House Repub-
licans are drafting. At the same
time, Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.
Va., has proposed atwo-year mor-
atorium on EPA attempts to regu-
p

late greenhouse gases under the
Clean Air Act, a plan that already
has attracted a handful of Demo-
cratic supporters.
The Supreme Court ruled in
2007 that the EPA has author-
ity to regulate greenhouse gases
under the Clean Air Act, but it,
wasn't until the Obama adminis-
tration took office that the effort
began.
Initially, the administration's
principal focus in the area was on
passage of legislation to impose
restrictions, but that attempt
failed when the Senate balked at
a bill Democrats pushed through
the House in 2009.
Since the Republican elec-
tion gains of last fall, Obama has
made several moves to accom-
modate the concerns of business,
including an executive ordert&
weed out proposed new regula-
tions that would hurt job growth.
Despite the order, there has
been no indication to date that
the White House intends to stop
plans to regulate greenhouse
gases through the Clean Air Act.

New video seeks to discredit Planned Parenthood

0

Pro-life group calls
for investigation
of New Jersey clinic
NEW YORK (AP) - An- anti-
abortion group yesterday released
undercover video taken in its lat-
est attempt to discredit an orga-
nization that provides abortions
- footage of operatives posing as
a pimp and a prostitute seeking
health services at a New Jersey
clinic.
The group releasing the video,
Live Action, said it depicted
a Planned Parenthood clinic
employee offering to help cover
up a sex ring so that its prostitutes
could receive health services.

Planned Parenthood said it had
promptly notified law enforce-
ment authorities after the visit,
but it also announced late yes-
terday that it had fired the clinic
employee for violatingsome of the
organization's policies.
Planned Parenthood had proac-
tively revealed the broad outlines
of the new undercover operation
last week, reporting that at least
12 of its clinics across the country
had been visited by men claiming
to be sex-traffickers.
The organization, which is the
leading U.S. provider of abor-
tions, asked federal authorities to
investigate and said it had identi-
fied a man involved in the visits as
linked to Live Action.
Yesterday, Live Action released

a video that it said was taken Jan.
13 at a Planned Parenthood clinic
in Perth Amboy, New Jersey.
In the video, a woman identi-
fied as the clinic manager con-
verses with a man and a woman
posing as sex traffickers regarding
their interest in accessing contra-
ception, abortions and sexually
transmitted-disease testing for
underage prostitutes.
As depicted in the video, the
clinic manager advises that the
underage girls could lie about
their age to lessen the chance of
triggering an investigation once
they sought health services.
"For the most part, we want as
little information as possible," the
employee says, according to the
video.

The video also depicts the
employee suggesting that pros-
titutes could get cheaper contra-
ception by claiming they were
students.
"Yeah, just kind of play along
that they're students - we want to
make it look as legit as possible,"
the woman identified as the clinic
manager says.
Live Action said it was making
available both edited and unedited
versions of the video.
"This proves beyond a shadow
of a doubt that Planned Parent-
hood intentionally breaks state
and federal laws and covers up the
abuse of the young girls it claims
to serve," said Lila Rose, presi-
dent of Live Action. She called for
federal and state investigations

of Planned Parenthood practices,
and urged Congress to cut off fed-
eral family-planning grants to the
organization.
Paul Loriquet, a spokesman
for New Jersey Attorney General
Paula Dow, said Dow's office is
"looking into the allegations."
Responding to the video
release, Planned Parenthood
issued a statement detailing its
efforts to notify state and federal
authorities after the recent clinic
visits. It said the FBI had been
collecting evidence from Planned
Parenthood employees and clin-
ics, and reviewing photos of at
least one of the persons claiming
to be a trafficker.
"Planned Parenthood insists
on the highest standards of care,

and safeguards the trusted rela-
tionship we have with patients,
families and communities," the
statement said. "What appears on
edited tapes made public today is
not consistent with Planned Par-
enthood's practices, and is under
review."
Phyllis Kinsler, chief executive
officer of Planned Parenthood
of Central New Jersey, said in a
statement issued late yesterday
that she and her colleagues were
"profoundly shocked when we
viewed the videotape released
this morning, which depicted
an employee of one of our health
centers behaving in a repugnant
manner that is inconsistent with
our standards of care and is com-
pletely unacceptable."

'Idol' starting to idle

'Dancing Americas'
promises live music
and improvisation
By LUCY PERKINS
Daily Arts Writer
Geographically, the Americas

equator. Two oceans lap at their
shores, while mountains, rivers,
lakes and
canyons Dancige

the terrain.

are cultures
- each with Power Center
a story to Tickets from $10
dance.
"Dancing Americas" is a
School of Music, Theatre &
Dance performance aimed at
celebrating the rich history and
color of the Americas. The pro-
duction has been in the works
since auditions began last Sep-
tember and involves 45 dancers.
Its four diverse pieces incorpo-
rate cultural influences through
the use of authentic costumes,
music and movement.
"It's been fascinating to work
on," said MT&D Prof. Judy Rice,
the artistic director of the pro-
duction.
The opening piece is a
"MinEvent," which includes four
pieces by the late modern dance
pioneer Merce Cunningham,
whose company will perform in
Ann Arbor later this month. The
piece is set to a live performance
by the Digital Music Ensemble of
John Cage's "Cartridge Music."
"The music and the dancing
happen simultaneously but are

not necessarily involved with
one another," Rice said.
MT&D sophomore Alejandro
Quintanilla, who is a member of
the production, said that the live
music presented a unique aspect
of the production.
"In the 'MinEvent,' dancers
don't know what they're going
to hear when they perform it,"
Quintanilla said. "The musicians
do a lot of improvisation so the
dancers have to count all the
steps."
The second piece, "Towards a
sudden silence," choreographed
by MT&D lecturer Melissa Beck,
is inspired by the poetry of Hop-
wood award winner and 'U' alum
Marge Piercy.
"It's a passionate work and an
interesting piece to follow (Cun-
ningham's)," Rice said. "I've seen
it just morph, and every time I
see it I want to see it again."
Rice described the piece as
being set in the late '50s and early
'60s. Dancers wear costumes
reminiscent of the era, incorpo-
rating classic pillbox hats.
"The movement connotes both
constraint and struggle to break
societal constrictions of the era,"
Rice said. "It's one of those piec-
es that Melissa doesn't want to
say too much about, because she
wants the audience to take what
they want away from it."
The third and last piece before
the intermission, "Tango con
la vida," is a new piece choreo-
graphed by MT&D Prof. Sandra
Torijano. The work is tied to Latin
American rhythms and culture
with black dresses, bowler hats
and bright red lipstick adorning
dancers as they move to the music
of the Latina Strings Ensemble on
an elaborately set stage.
"This piece is Sandra's cel-
ebration of life, after struggling
with leukemia for the past two

years," Rice said.
The final piece is perhaps the
most anticipated segment of the
show. Titled "The Summit," the
number is a brand new work of
guest choreographer Dianne
McIntyre.
"This piece has been the most
fun I've had while dancing in a
few years," Quintanilla said.
According to Quintanilla, the
piece is a narrative of two tribes
separated by animosity, with
one dancer trying to bring them
together.
McIntyre didn't start to cho-
reograph the piece until January,
after rehearsals began. Because
the piece was actually choreo-
graphed in rehearsal, its creation
heavily depended upon the col-
laboration of the dancers, musi-
cians and the choreographer.
"Sometimes it's a little slow
because you have to figure out
what (McIntyre) sees so you can
do it," Quintanilla said.
For Quintanilla, working so
closely with McIntyre was an
exciting experience.
"Her movement style is very
closely related to my movement
style, which has- made it a lot
of fun," Quintanilla said. "It's
dynamic yet smooth ... it's realis-
tic, it's not overacted or trying to
be 'dancey.' I guess it's fluid with
a punch to it."
The music for "The Summit"
is also played live. The ensemble
includes bass, drums, guitar,
flute, trombone and trumpet.
"It's phenomenal to hear it,"
Rice said. "I was watching a
rehearsal the other night and I
had shivers."
Through each step, leap and
pirouette, emotion silently ema-
nates from the stage. Dancers
will spin stories through move-
ment - sharingthe culture of the
Americas.

I remember it so well - the
screaming fans, Simon's gri-
mace as he folded his arms and
glared at the young would-be
singers and the yelps of fami-
lies as triumphant contestants
revealed they'd received those
fateful words: "You're going to
Hollywood!"
There was Kelly, Ruben, Car-
rie and Clay Aiken! Remember
William Hung? That's right, the
"She Bangs" guy - in case you
forgot he was actually famous
for a short while. He was famous
because of "American Idol."
The show used to mean some-
thing. It was a landmark televi-
sion event when it first aired,
with the promise of turning
a nobody into the next musi-
cal superstar. And it worked.
Since her first-season win,
Kelly Clarkson has released
four albums, one of which went
multi-platinum and won two
Grammy Awards. Aiken didn't
even win, but he still became a
pop sensation. Again and again
the show lived up to its reputa-
tion as a vehicle to stardom. Just
making the final round provided
fame for more than a few poten-
tial Idols. This was back when
Simon and Paula bickered and
Randy remained neutral from
his side of the table.
But recently, things have
changed. At first, it was vis-
ible in the judging table. Singer-
songwriter Kara DioGuardi was
added as a judge in season eight.
This was fine until both she and
Paula dropped out. Then one
day I turned on the TV and Ellen
DeGeneres was hosting. Now,
I'm no expert, but what does
Ellen know about music? She
may know a lot about hosting a
daytime talk show, but singing,
not so much.
Where does that leave us
now? On Jan. 19 Fox premiered
season 10 of "American Idol."
Ryan Seacrest still hosts and
Jackson still comments and
criticizes from his corner. So
what specifically has turned
this pop culture phenomenon
into a shadow of its former
self? Maybe it's the revolving-
door judges seem to have gone
through in the past few years
(we're now on to Jennifer Lopez
and Aerosmith's Steven Tyler).
Or maybe it's the fact that,

Sequels gratify in gaming

A rabbi and a priest walk into a shitty movie ...
e Rite' is all wrong

By TIMOTHY RABB
DailyArts Writer
Watch out, demons. Father
Hopkins is here, and he doesn't
play by the rules. His cassock is
rumpled and
undone, he's a
relentless cat
hoarder and
he answers his
cell phone in At Quality 16
the middle of and Rave
his exorcisms.
Yeah, bet you'll Warner Bros
be surprised
when he pulls that phone out and
you discover that your demonic
antics aren't the center of atten-
tion anymore. That'll teach you to
possess people.
This playful anecdote isn't just
a short snippet of "The Rite," but
a summary of the whole film's
attitude toward the practice of
exorcism. The current demand
for exorcists in the Catholic
Church is as high as ever, and
this film is a pitiful, irreverent
homage to their sacred duties,
regardless of whether you believe
the symptoms of possession are
spiritual or not.
Young adult Michael Kovak
(newcomer Colin O'Donoghue)
decides to leave his father's mor-
tuary practice to attend seminary.
When his doubts lead him away
from priesthood, a chain reaction
causes a young woman's untimely

death and a crisis of faith. At the
behest of one of the seminary's
priests) Kovak gives spirituality
one last chance and leaves Amer-
ica for a two-month stint as an
exorcist's apprentice in Rome.
It's hard not to suspect that
several of the scenes depicting a
timid Kovak and his father work-
ing with cadavers were directly
plagiarized from HBO's "Six Feet
Under." The film finally starts to
pick up and show some promise
and originality in the second act,
but eventually disappoints in the
end with a textbook wrap-up.
Fortunately, "The Rite" has a
savior. Sir Anthony Hopkins does
a wonderful job as Father Lucas
Trevant, an experienced exor-
cist whose tenacious, unchecked
pursuit of demons leads to a dis-
turbing final standoff between
Kovak and the devil himself. But
brilliant as it is, the performance
is strewn in small bits throughout
the film, and can't compensate for
the otherwise-lackluster acting.
Granted, a priest was suppos-
edly present on the set of the
movie, which lends credence to
the possession scenes. The fact
that the script is adapted from
a book with real-life accounts
doesn't hurt, either. But you'll
be surprised at how many liber-
ties it takes with the narrative
direction. One minute someone's
possessed; the next, dead. Then
someone halfway across the

world dies. Then someone else
becomes possessed. Then anoth-
er person, but this time it's not
a demon, it's Satan himself. Pre-
posterous storytelling.
It's a tasteless Devil's stew - a
hodgepodge of cinematic com-
ponents have been wantonly
dumped into a boiling pot, but
everyone's simply too lazy to mix
it all together. What you inevi-
tably get in return is a chunky
mess of a movie with a plot that
meanders so lazily from beat to
beat that we can't appreciate any
I exorcised his
demon with a
nice chianti.
real progression. Several riveting
moments in the narrative bol-
ster the sense of excitement, but
a 110-minute film can't sustain
itself without plenty of good con-
tent, and "The Rite" ambles along
far too lazily to be a good film.
This adaptation from one man's
real life account of priesthood
could do so much more with such
a weathered veteran of thriller/
drama films, but it trades tal-
ent for amateurism and a typical
Hollywood ending. "The Rote"
would've been a better title.

By SHIN HIEFTJE
DailyArts Writer
Sequels have often been
frowned upon in film, as few
sequels live up to the original.
Rarely is this the case for video
games. Because there are so
many aspects that make up video
games, there's always room for
improvement in a sequel - be it
the graphics, the story or a new
game mechanic.
While it's always ideal to wish
for there to be more fresh titles
coming out, the reality of the
business is that making games is
expensive, and creating a sequel
to an established franchise will
always be easier and financially
safer than bringing out anuntest-
ed name. But sequels shouldn'tbe
bemoaned simply for being itera-
tive. New games in a franchise
usually only arise if the predeces-
sor was good, which means that
the upcoming product will most
likely be better.
I say all this because 2011 is
shaping up tobe a year chock-full
of sequels. It almost looks like
there are more video games with
a number at the end than without.
Fortunately, most of these titles
look really, really promising.
Sony's two premier first-per-
son shooter franchises, "Killzone
3" and "Resistance 3," are set
to release on Feb. 22 and Sept.
6, respectively, and Microsoft's
"Gears of War 3" is expected in
September. All three of these
games look beautiful and have
the human race fighting against
a race of ugly monsters of some
form or another. Go figure.

outs of being a college defense-

helped me mature as a person off
the ice, too. He took me under
his wing, being his roommate on
the road."
From seeing Summers move
from his four-year collegiate
career to the professional ranks,
Burlon hopes to follow a similar
path - and it's one that 50-plus
other Wolverines have taken as
well.
"It's not a secret, a lot of the
players that come to Michigan
want to play pro hockey," Michi-
gan coach Red Berenson said
last Thursday. "We've provided
a program to help players be
smarter, stronger, more mature
and hopefully better players
that learn how to win."
Berenson continued, saying
that "you don't have to be a first
round pick" necessarily to make
it to The Show, with "some kids
really taking off once they get
(to Michigan)."
Summers had both attributes,
in fact.
Drafted in the first round and
29th overall in the 2006 NHL
Entry Draft, Summers brought

a skill-set to Ann Arbor similar
to that of Los Angeles defense-
man and former Wolverine, Jack
Johnson. Summers, a strong,
offensive-minded defenseman,
excelled prior to his Michigan
days with the U.S. National
Team Development Program
and continued to improve with
the Wolverines - he totaled 16
goals and 44 assists in 163 games
under Berenson.
But even with so many Wol-
verines having the fortunate
opportunity to play in the NHL,
according to Berenson, playing
in NHL isn't the end-all, be-all
of playing for Michigan.
"We're sitting in here, we're
trying to make everyone learn
how to play on a winning team
and learn how to make them-
selves better players as well as
be more than a hockey player,"
Berenson said. "I don't want to
see guys leave Michigan and
play 10 years in the minors. I
don't want to see guys be hockey

PERSONALSTATEMENT

DEVOTED TO DETROIT
THE PRIDE FOR A CITY
W IT H A BAD REPUTATION
BY ALEXIS SMITH

hometown is a vital aspect
of your identity, and most
people have pride for some
place that they've lived. How-
ever, some cities are difficult to
be proud of. Detroit, Michigan
is rich in American history, both
good and bad. It was Michigan's
original capitol and the original
home of the University'of Michi-
gan. As the birthplace of Motown,
the center of the American auto-
mobile industry and a significant
component of the Underground
Railroad, Detroit has had a rich
history.
Over recent decades, Detroit
has gained abad reputation among
its neighboring cities as well as the
rest of the country. A high crime
rate as a result of increasing pov-
erty keeps the evening news bleak.
Every journalist and documentar-
ian loves to expose the "struggling
ghettos of Motor City." It some-
times seems they revel in a crum-
bling city that once thrived. I am
fully aware of its flaws. Some cit-
ies are difficult to love.
I was born in Detroit's east
side. I was raised on Detroit's
west side. I attended Detroit Pub-
lic Schools from kindergarten to
DETROIT
From Page 5B
"Kind of like what you guys are
doing in Detroit?" I asked. It's a
leading question, and she knows it.
She looks at me and smirks and
explains that Detroit is different
than everyone believes.
"(In Detroit) we're all walking
down the street, and we're going to
different places," Solowy said as she
plasters a piece of the local Span-
ish newspaper to the bullfrog mold.
"But we're all walking down the
same street."
WHO ARE YOU? WHY
ARE YOU HERE?
A youngboy inan oversized
jacket leaned on the table in the
middle of the room. He was the

high school graduation. I gradu-
ated from Detroit's most famous
high school, Cass Tech. I received
my high school diploma at COBO
Hall. Regardless of my location
today, I live and breath Detroit.
Unfortunately, this is not true for
many Detroiters.
Many locals have little to no
pride in the city. I don't blame
them. How, do you have pride in
your hometown when the mayor
is being indicted? How do you love
the city where your loved one was
senselessly murdered? It's no won-
der why many Detroiters quickly
make their way to the suburbs.
Upon graduation, I didn't want
to abandon my hometown, but it
seemed unreasonable to stay in a
city riddled with unemployment,
poverty and crime.
It's a shame because I have
unconditional love for Detroit. Of
all the places I've visited, I felt the
greatest pulse from Detroit. With
so many people living at or below
the poverty line, the residents
don't have very much. They can't
go out to dinner or visit the-theater
or do other high-class activities as
frequently as those who occupy
the suburbs. In fact, many Detroit
only one who said anything when I
entered the building.
I introduced myself and asked
him about himself. i
His name is Daniel and he's 13.
After he left the room I asked LSA
sophomore Riley Linebaugh if he's
actually 13.
As we began the interview, she
quietly explained that he is mal-
nourished.
After three days talking with the
people in Detroit, I finally started
to understand the shared learning
that occurs between the interns
and the communities.
In Ann Arbor, I sit at a desk
learning from professors. In
Detroit, Linebaugh learns from
Daniel.
She walked me around the small
brick building at Clark Park Recre-
ation Center. The snow had settled
on the adjacent football field and

neighborhoods have close com-
munities, and they find fun in less
expensive ways. I recall as a child,
the entire town smelled like bar-
beque on Labor Day. It was com-
mon to hear popular music filling

outsiders to appreciate
home if you don't?"
the neighborhoods. There was a
time when young guys (and some-
times girls) would gather together
for a rap battle. Belle Isle in the
summertime was always a party.
These activities still go on, but
due to rising pessimism and hard
economic times, they are less fre-
quent than in previous years.
For a while, it seemed like the
city wasn't as great as it is. Like
many of my classmates in high
school, I planned to leave Detroit
once I entered the working world.
Many wanted to leave Michigan
all together, but I just wanted to
move to the suburbs. The glam-
our of places like Grosse Pointe,
Rochester and Birmingham drew
my attention. Everyone who has
the grey goal posts jut up out of the
snow, filling the empty space. A few
people ambled across the park's
worn ice rink as a mother drops
two girls off at the front door.
Linebaugh began to tell me
about her first few days in the city.
How, at first, she read all the safe-
ty handbooks and walked rigidly
down the street, averting eye con-
tact. But then she began smiling
and interacting with people. She
started to feel disconnected from
Ann Arbor and now can't even
fathom that people are walking
through the Diag as she is walking
through the streets of Detroit.
Her father, a professor, was con-
cerned that Linebaugh would be
hurt by her time not spent in the
library.
But it's been outside of the class-
room, through her involvement
with Clark Park Recreation Center

lived in Detroit has visited at least
one suburb (you really can't avoid
it) and knows how better look-
ing they are. I remember going
to a Subway in Dearborn with my
uncle. Upon crossing the street
separating Dearborn from Detroit,
I immediately noticed the build-
ings looked better kept in Dear-
born and the graffiti didn't leave
Detroit. Sometimes while travel-
ing, I have to ask what city I am
in, but I can always tell when I'm
entering Detroit from a suburb.
I have also been to other cities
across the United States. I've been
to Chicago, San
Diego, Sandusky
and Columbus,
your but the trip that
stands out in my
mind is Houston,
Texas. My first
trip to Houston was in 2002. I was
12, and it was a vacation to visit
my family there. I fell in love with
Houston during that trip. Despite
the unbearable Texas heat, I had
a great time with my aunts, uncles
and older cousins.
For a long time after that I
had as much love, if not more, for
Houston as I did for Detroit. This
was until we went again in 2007 -
don't get me wrong, it was great.
Yet, I was homesick. My family
was with me on the trip, but I was
longing to return home. Once our
plane landed, I had a great urge to
kiss the ground. My first thought
was: "Other cities may be nice, but
Detroit is where I belong." I knew
I loved Detroit.
where Linebaugh has felt her voice
develop. It holds more weight, she
says.
Despite having spent the past
seven years of her life in Ann Arbor,
Linebaugh hadn't spent much time
in Detroit. She'd only been to the
Detroit Institute of Art to view her
favorite mural, Detroit Industry,
painted by Diego Rivera.
Because of her experience in
the city, that mural has come alive.
Now she thinks constantly about
the auto industry and about the
economy of Detroit. She wonders
how it will affect the city, how it's
going to affect Clark Park, how it's
goingto affect Daniel.
"These are the people that I'm
not learning about in my class-
rooms (in Ann Arbor)," Linebaugh
said.
"We talk in a lot of my classes
about negative space - what's

Conversely, one of my cousins
from Houston was here during
this past winter break. My cousin
and I decided to give him a tour
of the city. The tour was a disap-
pointment in two ways. First, we
only gave him a tour of down-
town Detroit. Though the great
tourist attractions in Detroit are
located downtown, it's only a por-
tion of the entire city. Detroit is
more than just downtown. Sec-
ond, my cousin, our tour guide,
held very little pride in the city,
and it showed in the tour. Nothing
seemed great about the area. I had
actually never been to Greektown
before, and was in awe of how
beautiful it was. It was like a min-
iature, Greek-themed Las Vegas,
but my cousin made it as exciting
as a fire hydrant.
This tour solidified what I
already felt. Whether it's Detroit,
Ann Arbor, Seattle, Newark,
Toronto, London or Beijing, every-
one should have pride in his or her
hometown. How can you expect
outsiders to appreciate your home
if you don't? How can an area be
so relevant to your life and you
have no love for it? Whether you
move around a lot or have been in
the same place since birth, there
is one place that has contributed
most to your identity. That place
deserves your gratitude. I would
be a completely different person
if I hadn't grown up in Detroit.
Therefore, in loving myself, I also
love the Motor City.
-Alexis Smith is an LSA Junior
missing in the academic curricu-
lum or what's missing in the book
you're reading," she said. "I think
Detroit's voice is what's been miss-
ing in my personal curriculum.
Coming here is not going to fill
that negative space because it's an
enormous city, and I'm never going
to be able to know all of it.
"But I'm going to start being
able to fill in some of that negative
space."
For the 19 students who are now
engaged in this experience, not
one would trade places with a stu-
dent studying in Europe or South
America this semester. Ask them
to explain why and their words
wouldn't do it justice. But ask them
to describe an experience, and they
each can speak of moments that
have changed their lives and have
seen that change in a city that has
been written off by most.

THEJUNKDRAWER
random student interview by adam rubenlire


Welcome to the Random
Student Interview,
where the line between
journalistic integrity and per-
sonal boundaries becomes
blurred.
What are your thoughts on the
Snowpocalypse?
It's kind of exciting. I don't really
like snow, but Ilike when big events
happen.
Big events like a bar mitzvah?
Just like, all over the news. Every-
one's freakingout,you know.
So like if somebody dies or is
murdered?
Not like that. Just like fun things.
How much snow do you think
we'llget?
Like a foot, I'mgonna guess.
Do you think that's enough to
cancel classes?
I definitely think so. I feel like walk-
ing in a foot of snow is a lot. That'd
be very challenging.
What are you going to think
about President Mary Sue Cole-
man if she doesn't cancel?
I only have two classes tomorrow,
so I'll just be like, whatever, but I
think she should because it's kind of
ridiculous.

You ever thought of slipping
something in her drink to make
her do it?
No, I don't care that much.
Why do you think we haven't had
a snow day in 3O years?
I don't think it's ever really been
that crazy before, snow-wise.
So, did youhear about all the pro-
testing in Egypt?
No, not really.
You haven't heard about it?!
No, very minimal.
Well they're protesting because
Mark Whalberg got snubbed out
of an Oscar. Did you hear about
that? The Egyptians are really
upset.
Is this for real? I don't know, like,
anything..
No, it's not, I was lying, you
caught me.
I was just making sure.
So did you hear the Black Eyed
Peas are performing at the Super
Bowl?
No, I didn't.
You didn't? What do you think
about that?
That's good, they're pretty current
and popular. I like them, so that's
godd.

What do you think Fergie's.
chances are of a wardrobe mal-
function?
It's probably not gonna happen.
I think everyone's learned from
before.
Would you like it if it happened
again?
No, I don't roll that way.
Oh, OK.
I'm sure other people wouldthough.
Oh ... so you think she's attrac-
tive?
I think she's pretty.
What do you think her cup size
is?
I don't know, kind of big I feel like.
What classes are you taking this
semester?
I have two psych classes, and then
econ and musicology, so it's pretty
good.
What's that musicology class
about?
First we learn about the elements of
music, and now we're going to the
history and a lot of classical stuff.
So Mozart and all that crap?
And Beethoven, yeah.
So dead guy music?
Yes, very, very old.
Do you ever have a musicology

class about people who actually
matter?! Like Taylor Swift?
They have one on rock, which is a
little bit more current, but a lot of
them are dead too.
So is the one on rock all about
groupies and LSD?
I know that The Beatles are in it, I
think Elvis is in there too.
So basically everybody who got
drugged up and recorded?
Yeah, basically. Foundations of
Rock is what it's called.
Do you ever make music when
you're drugged up?
No, I play clarinet and piano, but I
don't really get drugged up.
What's your major?
Brain Behavior and Cognitive Sci-
ence.
So ... you're thinking about how
you're thinking?
Yeah.
Yeah? What am I thinking right
now?
About your interview? I don't know.
Wrong! I'm thinking about
Jimmy Johns, and I'm about to
go eat it.
Oooh, Jimmy Johns is good.

According to Spratling, the 75
University also conducted an
on-site admissions process at
Mumford where University
staff looked over students'
transcripts. Though they
would not tell students whether
they were accepted, they would tell students if
they were likely to gain admission or what steps to take
if they weren't likely to gain admission.
Erica Sanders, director of recruitment and operations in
the University's Office of Undergraduate Admissions said
when reading applications, the University reviews students'
academic performance in the context of their academic
environment and their school's resources.
"This ensures that we have students from a variety of
academic backgrounds who are able to learn from each other
both in and out of the classroom," she said.
The University's Detroit Admissions Office focuses on
students from DPS by working directly with the community
through outreach programs. Through these programs, DPS
students and their families are informed of the University's
academic expectations of students. The office also holds
college planning workshops, application review days and
workshops.
* The culture shock
Beyond recruitment, the University takes steps to ensure
students coming from districts like DPS feel socially and
academically comfortable when they arrive on campus.
Many DPS students admitted to the University join the
Comprehensive Studies Program - a Michigan Learning
Community within LSA that provides academic support for
students. Students in the program can enroll in CSP courses
on subjects ranging from English to chemistry. In these
settings, students learn in smaller groups with other CSP
students and have more one-on-one time with professors.
One of the most beneficial CPS programs is the Summer
Bridge Program. An intensive, highly individualized
academic program, the Summer Bridge Program allows
a limited number of students from across the country to
develop their academic skills and become comfortable in
the University's social environment before the fall semester.
Students in the program typically enroll in an English
course, a mathematics course and a freshman seminar.
These courses help students develop the fundamental skills
they didn't learn in their high school curriculum. Each of
these courses contributes to the number of credits students
need to graduate.


Ralph Story, associate director of the
Comprehensive Studies Program, said it helps
students develop a sense of camaraderie with their
peers.
"It familiarizes them with both institutional and
human resources," he said. "It gives them a firm handle and
understanding of classrooms, buildings, and the physical
lay of the land of the University. And they take small classes
with very empathetic teachers who spend a lot of time with
them inside and outside of class."
Spratling, a Summer Bridge Program participant,
believes the program reduces the "culture shock" that many
underrepresented minority students and students from
inner-city schools feel upon arriving at the University.
"The neighborhood I grew up in was a predominantly
black neighborhood. All of my schools were predominantly
black, so when I came to U of M for Summer Bridge, I
thought, 'Wow this is an entirely different environment,"'
Spratling said. "I felt - I'm not going to say alone - but I
didn't feel like the diversity that Michigan was supposed to
aim for was what I was witnessing at the time."
The Summer Bridge Program has helped the University
ease the potentially difficult transition period for incoming
students from areas like the inner city of Detroit.
"The Summer Bridge Program helps get (DPS students) to
a place so they can say, 'OK, I'm adequately acclimated to my
surroundings, I know what to expect, I can succeed here,' "
Conway said.
Other resources work to ensure that students' time at the
University is positive.
Intellectual Minds Making a Difference (IMMAD) is a
voluntary student organization that aims to eliminate the
academic achievement gap in the state of Michigan. While
the organization largely focuses on preparing students for
the ACT, it also serves as a mentoring opportunity. Students
in IMMAD go to Detroit Public Schools to encourage
students to attend college.
Logan said IMMAD was what ultimately motivated him
to apply to the University.
"One of the reasons why I did go to Michigan was because
I met people in IMAD who were just like me, who came from
the same place that I came from, who experienced the same
struggles, and actually were excelling in life," Logan said.
The academic challenge
Still, some former DPS students feel they are at a
disadvantage because University professors assume students
have certain fundamental skills that should've been taught
in high school.
"I very much had to work twice as hard to get half as far
for the first couple of semesters ... I had to show them I'm a

black man from DPS, and yes, I am still intellectually capable
of doing the work that you assigned," Conway said.
Despite students' various academic backgrounds, the
University strives to accept applicants who can handle its
rigorous academics. Sanders explained that the University
doesn't want to set students upfor failure.
"All students admitted to the University are prepared
for the academic environment the University of Michigan
offers," she said.
But several DPS students, whether they graduated from
a "Big Three" school or a Detroit neighborhood high school,
felt they were often playing catch-up during their first
semesters at the University.
Ross School of Business junior Tangela Cheatham
graduated from Cass Tech, but doesn't feel that the college
preparatory high school adequately prepared her for college.
"Academically, I think I'm at a disadvantage ... I struggle
with how to study effectively. I don't feel as prepared as my
counterparts who had more preparation with study habits in
high school," Cheatham said.
But LSA sophomore and Cass Tech graduate William
Campbell explained the DPS system is not entirely to blame.
"I'm not saying the Detroit Public School system is a great
system because it's not," Campbell said. "The resources are
terrible, but you are your own person, and you can always
make something out of nothing wherever you go."
Despite frustration over their high school curriculum,
most DPS alumni did not regret their DPS roots and see
themselves as ambassadors for their district.
"I look at ita lot like, no matter where you come from, you
can get to the same place, and I use it as an inspirational tool
because a lot of people did come from better schools than
me, but we all ended up at the same University," Spratling
said.
I What's next?
For the DPS alumni, returning to Detroit is a definite part
of their future. Many of these University students claim one
of the key problems with the DPS system is that the most
motivated and capable graduates leave the city and often
don't return.
Current University students and recent graduates are
ready to change this precedent, be it through non-profit
organizations, teaching, mentoringin Detroit Public Schools
or simply having a job in Detroit and paying taxes.
"If it weren't for Detroit, I wouldn't be the person I am
today," Logan said. "I feel like Detroit has helped raise me
... And I owe so much to the city of Detroit and its people.
My wife and I are moving back to Detroit, and I don't have
any qualms about it and I won't think twice about raising my
kids in Detroit Public Schools."

The U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan singled
out the Detroit Public School district in February
2009 during a nationwide discussion on the quality
of education in America by stating his extreme concern over
the education Detroit Public School studentswere receiving.
Two years after making those comments, Duncan has yet
to provide any concrete plans for the district.
It's not uncommon for politicians to make blanket
statements regarding the Detroit Public School system.
Based on test scores, grade point averages, attendance
records and dropout rates, Detroit Public Schools are a
struggling educational system. But accordingto DPS alumni
who currently attend or have graduated from the University
of Michigan, these numbers only tell half the story.
The district
The Detroit Public School system comprises zoned,
alternative and optional schools. As early as kindergarten,
students may attend "optional" schools in which an
examination is required before students are admitted. In
middle schools like Bates Academy and Hally Magnet,
students are placed in accelerated reading and math courses,
which are rigorous academic programs compared to the
average neighborhood school in Detroit. In the eighth grade,
every Detroit Public School student takes an examination to
determine whether he or she will gain acceptance to one of
the district's college preparatory high schools -King High
School, Cass Technical High School and Renaissance High
School - commonly referred to as "The Big Three."
University alum Byron Conway, who attended the
University on a full academic scholarship and is currently
attending Boston University Law School, was the only
student from his class at Kettering High School in Detroit
to gain acceptance to the University in 2006. Conway said
the distinction between test-in schools and neighborhood
schools greatly affects the mentality of DPS students and
their decision to continue on to higher education.
"Those schools were already bringing in students that
have the successful mentality. They have the 'I want to
succeed' mentality, whereas a lot of the other high schools
were community-based high schools - which means they
took in anyone from their community - and so they see a
lot more of the 'I just don't care mentality,' " Conway said.
"That's what really separated the caliber between the Cass
and Renaissance and Martin Luther King schools from the
Mumfords, the Murray Wrights and the Ketterings."
LSA Senior Bianca Renae Lee, a Renaissance High School

alum, saw the negative effects of this kind of mentality
firsthand.
"I've known people that took the exam and didn't get in
(to a 'Big Three' school), so when you throw people off like
that, they have that mentality for the rest of their high school
career," Lee said.
Andre Criswell, a University alum and current School of
Social Work student, graduated from Renaissance in 2006.
He said there is a large disparity in the academic curriculum
between test-in schools and neighborhood schools.
"The academics at Renaissance were extremely
challenging. And it has the reputation in Detroit as being
more challenging than Cass because it's more difficult to
get into, so Renaissance helped me a lot," Criswell said. "I
can't imagine how it would have felt coming from a place like
Mumford or Central to Michigan."
Who's applying?
The dichotomy between Detroit's college preparatory and
neighborhood schools is on display in the admissions data
for the University of Michigan provided by the University's
admissions office. In 2009, Cass Tech and Renaissance high
schools sent a higher number of students to the University
compared to neighborhood schools like Mumford, Denby
and Kettering. Based on the 2009 data, only a small pool
of students from neighborhood schools applied to the
University. At some neighborhood schools, no students
applied.
+ Ford High School - a neighborhood school in Detroit
with an enrollment of more than 1,200 students during the
2008 to 2009 school year - had only four students apply
to the University in 2009 compared to the 73 students who
applied from Renaissance, which had a comparatively lower
enrollment of 1,031 students during the same academic
year. During the same school year, more than 130 Cass Tech
students applied to the University.
Not one student out of the 2,147 enrolled in Detroit's
Southeastern High School during the 2008-2009 academic
school year applied to the University, according to data
provided by the University's admissions office
Conway attributed low application numbers among DPS
students to his peers' realistic attitude. Conway said that
though he graduated with a 4.0 GPA, the next highest grade
point average was a 3.5 and the next highest ACT score was
10 points below his.
James Logan, who graduated from the University in 2008,
is the only student out of the four accepted from his Mumford

High School class who decided to attend the University. He
believes many DPS students outside of "The Big Three"
are apprehensive about applying to the University largely
because they didn't think they would receive financial aid.
"So I think I was the only one that decided to come to
Michigan because I said, 'I don't care how much money I get,
I got into the best school in the state, let alone one of the best
schools in the nation, and I'm going."'
Logan also described a stereotype he believes many DPS
students associate with the University.
"They feel the stereotype of Michigan is not welcoming to
Detroit Public School students - more specifically, blacks,
to put that out there, and I think that a lot of students may
not consider Michigan as an option," he said. "I would say
they have an inferiority complex. There were 500 seniors my
senior year. If 400 graduated and only five applied, and only
one went in2004 - that's pretty shocking."
According to several former DPS students, there is a
public relations problem between the University and the
Detroit community. Former DPS students say the only thing
their classmates knew about the University was what their
parents said about it and that they perceived Michigan as a
huge University that was essentially an Ivy League school.
But the most common perception students from DPS share is
that "being a young person from Detroit, they would have no
place there," Logan said.
*jWhere is the 'U' recruiting?
For years, the University has actively recruited students
from Renaissance and Cass Tech. From an efficiency
standpoint; the University officials look to these schools
because they can recruit and admit qualified students. But
this causes a disadvantage those ,DPS students who, for
other circumstances beyond academic qualifications, did not
attend the city's premier high schools.
According to Conway, the University did not actively
recruit students from Kettering during his time at the high
school from 2002 to 2006.
"It's a little disturbing and a little unnerving to know
that, as much as I love the University, that they don't
necessarily think that it's worth the time to go into schools
like (Kettering)," he said.
But Ashley Spratling, an LSA junior and the 2008
valedictorian at Mumford High School, said that the
University actively reached out to the students of her
Mumford class. She recalls University staff coming to
Mumford with applications and pointers for the application

who Tanner knew from high school.
Tanner and her team's desires came at a conveniently fortu-
itous time. The state had just passed Proposal 2, a ballot initia-
tive that ended affirmative action, which meant the University
had to look for away to continue its commitment to racial diver-
sity in what Ward called a "newly restrictive context."
The University had also recently opened the Detroit Center
on Woodward Avenue in downtown Detroit, which would even-
tually provide the home base for the Semester in Detroit pro-
gram headquarters.
The four students spent the winter 2007 semester in weekly
meetings, and in May, Tanner, McCullagh and Nelson graduated
knowingthey would never be able to participate in the program
they had spent their senior years creating. It was Sagdeo who
assembled a new team to push for another year with the hope of
launching the program during the winter 2009 semester.
On the final day of the Semester in Detroit program in 2009,
Tanner returned to Detroit to sit in on the class in which stu-
dents discussed the impact the city had on their lives and the
changes they helped to bring about that term.
"I just remember being so happy," Tanner said. "It wasn't
faculty-driven, it wasn't administrative-driven, it was students
saying, 'We want to live and learn and work in Detroit' ... Just to
see that actually happen made meso happy."
Still in its infancy, the program has made its mark in Detroit -
more than half of the graduates have returned to live and work
in the city. And with the momentum the program has gained, it
will be launching its first spring semester in Detroit this May.
WE ARE NOT MISSIONARIES. WE ARE NOT
SAVIORS. WE AREN'T FIXING THE CITY.
Semester in Detroit Program Director Craig Regester sits at
his desk, leaning forward to make his point. He says it again. His
brown-rimmed glasses lay atop the bridge of his nose and his
dark brown hair carelessly tousled. He's a younger man with a
family. His wife and two young children smile at him constantly,
from a portrait pinned to the bulletin board behind his com-
puter.
On the opposite wall stands his bookshelf lined with pieces
of literature and novels. When he attended the University, he
wanted to be a teacher. He applied to be a volunteer with Teach
for America in New York City, but there was something about
Detroit that was drawing him there.
In college, he organized the University's first-ever Alterna-
tive Spring Break trip to Detroit where he and 12 other students
worked within the city for one week. The more he realized how
far Detroit felt from Ann Arbor, the less he wanted to travel the
distance to New York.
Before inviting me into his office, I sat ina classroom with his
19 students. They were participating in one of their first semi-
nars where they reflect upon their experiences within the city.
It was one of Tanner's demands when she came up with the idea
for the program - that students have the opportunity to share
their experiences.
I entered the room an hour into the meeting and was able
to catch the tail end of the first day's task. Regester had the
students collaborate based on their internship's mission state-
ment and discuss how the internships could use each other as

resources.
It seemed straightforward enough.
The next task became more involved. Their first assignment
from the program was to ride a Detroit Public Transportation
bus and reflect upon their experience.
A few girls had ridden the bus together and said they felt like
fools for not knowing how to use their passes. They fumbled
at the card reader until eventually the bus driver waved them
through, and they didn't have to pay. Another student in the
program rode the bus at night by himself, and a few students
looked impressed. The other young man in the program had
met an interesting older individual and conversed with him the

voice is what' s

personal curriculum.
entire ride. Finally, another girl had seen Eminem on her bus
ride.
"You have to spend some time in the city to really begin to
understand it, as you would in any city," Regester told me later
when we were sitting in his office.
"I would argue that in Detroit, it's a more complicated place
to understand than most urban areas. It's a city of extremes - of
really high highs and really low lows, but lots in between. And
that kind of experience, or identity of the city, lends itself to
being caricatured in many inaccurate ways - overstating and
romanticizingthe heyday and overstating or romanticizingthe
low points," Regester continued.
Detroit isn't broken, and it doesn't need fixing, Regester said.
He saw the confusion in my face and heard the skepticism in my
voice. And as per the professor in him, he jumped at the chance
to teach me.
"This is not a program for people who are coming in here to
save Detroit. We're not saviors, we're not missionaries," he stat-
ed in a patient voice.
"Sometimes there's this very romantic idea that we're going
to go in there and fixthings. Now, clearly what we're tryingto do
is to become part of solutions and contribute, it's not like there
isn't a common project - helping Detroit to become a better
place, but there's alot of assumptionsbehind that idea of fixing."
Regester was not talking about his job. He was talking about
the city he loves, and he was talking about his home. When he
talks about the future of the city, he sees the future of his chil-
dren - the two young children smiling back at him in the por-
trait.
HEY! DO YOU HAVE A DOLLAR?
On one of the first days that LSA senior Kit Solowy moved
into her dormitory at Wayne State University she was walking
down the street and talking on her cell phone to her mom when
a homeless man approached her asking for spare change.
She laughed as she recalled how her mom "freaked out," but

maintains that she was simply concerned.
"Well, should she be?" I asked.
Solowy stops. She looked for the right words to say. It was one
of the few times she pauses duringthe 30-minute interview.
"I guess you could get really scared if you let yourself," she
said quietly, but gained momentum with every sentence. "But
ultimately, I think people are good and that they want to help
you. People aren't scary. And I think Detroit is an easy place to
figure that out because it's such an amazing community that
engages with you as you walk down the street."
Solowy is spending this semester working at the Matrix The-
atre Company, a small 50-person theater in Southwest Detroit.
The street is quiet and the two-story brick building neighbors
two empty lots.
At the theater, her main projects are working with a com-
munity-involved story-telling group that will eventually write
a play and creating a marshland security project that promotes
the protection of natural spaces in Detroit. She explains that
the city was once an ecologically-rich marshland, but with the
amount of pollution and the empty lots that are being paved
over, the city is losingthe wildlife it once had.
Solowy went on to tell me about a fellow student who is
interning with a state official who fought to havea handicapped
man's water turned back on after the state turned it off.
It was one of those "real change" moments, she said.
She was genuinely proud and happy for her classmate and for
this man she didn't know. I asked her about her "real change
moment."
She believes it will come when her marshland security proj-
ect is completed. It will end with her and other community
volunteers putting on a surprise performance, also known as
guerrilla theater performances, dressed in frog masks to pro-
mote ecological awareness throughout the city.
"Frogs?" I asked, not sure I heard her correctly.
She led me out of the theater and up the narrow staircase
to show me the molds she made for the frog masks. Four large
lumps of newspaper sit wrapped in clear tape and saran wrap.
She explains each species - tree frog, bull frog - while point-
ing to each mask.
She told me that people have told her that the guerrilla the-
ater performance is unrealistic. People believe there won't be
enough masks completed, there won't be enough volunteers and
the community won't appreciate the message of the theater.

The foam nestled at the cop of the green mug. It was
my first time tasting Mexican hot chocolate, and I
was told I must try it from this corner coffee shop in
Southwest Detroit.
I sat inside the warm building as people passed by the large
windows going about their business. Some were carrying brief-
cases, others, all their possessions.
Sitting at the wrought iron table and brushing the cold, rough
surface with my elbows, I brought the mug to my mouth. The
hint of cinnamon in the hot chocolate surprised me. I hadn't
expected to taste the extra spice in the drink I thought I knew
so well. I wondered why I never thought of putting the two
together before. I sipped on my drink and made sure to thank
the owner before leaving.
"Come back anytime," he told me, his Mexican accent float-
ing on his words like the cinnamon on the chocolate.
I smiled, turned and walked out the door. The burst of cold
immediately made my eyes water and my body long to go back
into the coffee shop. The wind whipped at me, even throughmy
down jacket. In the distance, I could see the bridge that leads
east to Canada, and Iknew 40 mileswest, my friends and family
were in Ann Arbor.

corner in Detroit. "'

It is a city of circumstance built by the Industrial Age and
torn down by the media. It is a city that is, as some people say,
past its heyday and devoid of potential.
It is a city of boarded windows and empty streets, where
vacant lots serve asa constant reminder of what is said tobe the
substance of the city.
It is a city where Martin Luther King Jr.'s name is given to
a street where homeless men and women wait in line at soup
kitchens.
Like all cities, there is danger and war, pain and death.
But there are also the musical undertones, environmental
activists, political thought and social change.
And in the midst of all of this are 19 University of Michigan
students studying with the University's Semester in Detroit
Program.
They watch, from within, a city making strides toward
improvement and reinventing itself.
What they see is a city that is unexpectedly welcoming and
surprisinglyunique.
REACHING OUT TO THE CITY
Vhy do wehave a student program in Washington D.C, ut
na etroit? Why is it sMiicult foar t tt to meaningfully

engage in Detroit?"
It was the fall of 2006 when LSA senior Rachael Tanner was
sitting in Prof. Stephen Ward's Urban and Community Studies
course that she began asking these questions.
She had traveled to Washington, D.C. with the University's
Public Service Intern Program, she had been to Jamaica with
the Global Intercultural Experience for Undergraduates, and
she studied abroad in Salamanca, Spain, but never to anywhere
else inside the United States.
During her junior year she visited Detroit through two of
her political science courses, but didn't have an extended stay,
which limited her opportunities for involvement in the Detroit
community.
For her final project that semester, Tanner presented the idea
of an academic exchange program in Detroit. She envisioned a
program where students took classes and lived at Wayne State
University, where students spent 16hours each week working in
the community, and where students began to interact with the
city she was beginning to understand.
Three of Tanner's classmates jumped at the opportunity to
spearhead the program's development. She was joined by LSA
seniors Molly McCullagh and Jaime Nelson, with whom she
had worked with on an alternative springbreak trip and an anti-
Proposal2campaign, respectively, and LSA junior AditiSagdeo,
