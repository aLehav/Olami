Annual event 

showcases traditional 

forms of dance, 

music 

By TANYA MADHANI

Fifteen minutes before the 

start 
of 
Michigan 
Sahana’s 

fall semester show, LSA senior 

Hamsini Rao, president of the 
organization, stood in front of a 
group of 30 students and Sahana 
members to deliver one of her 
final pre-performance speeches.

“This is my last fall show, so 

I’m a little sad,” she said. “But 
when the whole auditorium is 
giving you a standing ovation, 
you’ll feel so good about yourself 
and you’ll feel like this is what 
Sahana is about.”

Friday’s 
show 
was 
called 

“Tulana,” a word that means 

contrast and appeared as a 
recurring 
theme 
in 
all 
the 

performances. 
The 
group 

performs three times each year.

Engineering senior Sandeep 

Siva, vice president of Sahana, 
said the goal of this year’s concert 
was to educate attendees about 
various aspects of Indian classical 
arts. The group’s fall concert is 
the academic year’s introductory 
concert, which is why it is 
themed, unlike the winter and 
spring concerts. 

“What we’re trying to do with 

this concert is show different 
elements in Indian classical music 
and dance and how all of these 
elements have different sides to 
them,” Siva said. “By putting them 
together, you create something 
equal and elegant.”

LSA senior Esha Biswas said the 

fall concert perfectly portrayed 
the meaning of tulana, because 
there are many performers from 
different 
musical 
and 
dance

Faculty touts 

mandatory study 
participation as 

valuable for growth 

By KATIE PENROD

Daily Staff Reporter

Many University classes — 

particularly those in psychology 
and communications — require 
students participate in research 
studies for class credit. The 
aim: expose undergraduates 
to research in their fields and 
give them the opportunity to 
help the University fulfill its 
research mission.

For example, students in 100-

level Psychology classes register 
with Sona Systems, a platform 
for recruiting student research 
subjects. Students enrolled in 
Communications 102 sign up for 
a similar service.

Scott Campbell, professor 

of 
telecommunications 

and 
associate 
professor 

of 
communications, 
said

component 
of 
his 

Communications 
102 
class 

exposes students to research 
within 
their 
field. 
The 

system allows researchers to 
post studies online and lets 
registered 
students 
choose 

studies they qualify for and 
want 
to 
participate 
in. 
If 

students are under 18, the 
program 
requires 
parental 

consent before participating in 
any research study.

“By giving them some direct, 

hands-on experience, for some 
students, it peaks their interest 
and fuels that fire,” Campbell 
said. “In the past, many students 
have asked me if they can be 
a research assistant of mine 
or if they could help run these 
studies. That’s a benefit to the 
subset of students that become 
interested in research. That’s 
not probably most students, 
but an important chunk of 
them. The rest of the students 
get a sense of how we do our

TV REVIEW

‘Master of None’ 
a topical coming-
of-age story from 
acclaimed comic

By SAMUEL ROSENBERG

Daily Arts Writer

The archetype of a young 

person finding his or her way 
in the world is a familiar one. 
We’ve 
seen 

this character 
in 
countless 

coming-of-
age television 
shows, 
mov-

ies and novels. 
But 
perhaps 

the 
reason 

why 
stories 

continue to revolve around 
this archetype is because we 
all encounter similar personal 
obstacles at some point in our 
lives. 
For 
32-year-old 
Aziz 

Ansari, this character could 
not be more relatable. Known 
for his sharp stand-up comedy 
and his role as the goofy, cul-

tured Tom Haverford on NBC’s 
“Parks and Recreation,” Ansari 
adapts this archetype and his 
own experience of living in the 
modern world in his semi-auto-
biographical show “Master of 
None.” Gleaming with ambition 
and charm, “Master of None” 
offers insightful commentaries 
on the entertainment industry, 
technology, 
family, 
diversity 

and dating. 

In addition to writing and 

creating the show with “Parks 
and Rec” writer Alan Yang, 
Ansari plays the protagonist 
Dev Shah, a 30-something, up-
and-coming actor navigating 
through life in Manhattan with 
his diverse group of friends and 
his parents — played by Ansa-
ri’s actual parents. Though the 
show only delivers a meager 10 
episodes, each has its own deft 
blend of hysterical one-liners, 
tasteful cinematography and 
perceptive drama. The show’s 
opener “Plan B” explores the 
perks of single life versus mar-
ried life through Dev’s botched 
one-night stand and venture to 
a child’s birthday party. 

Rudock’s career-
high 337 yards help 
Michigan move to 
7-2 on the season

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

Jabrill Peppers jogged onto 

the field as Michigan offense 
began its second series, and 
Rutgers was ready for it. After 
six offensive touches for 51 
yards and a touchdown over his 

last two games, Peppers was a 
secret no more. Fifth-year senior 
quarterback Jake Rudock took 
the snap, and the entire defense 
flocked toward Peppers.

He was a decoy. With most 

of the Scarlet Knights in the 
backfield, 
Michigan 
senior 

fullback Sione Houma escaped 
into the flat for a 32-yard 
reception.

“(Peppers) 
presents 

something that you need to 
watch,” Rudock said. “If we can 
use him to get him the ball, great. 
If we can use him as a decoy to 
get somebody else the ball, that’s 

great too. He understands that, 
too. … You just love a guy like 
that, who just really wants to 
win the game regardless of what 
happens.”

The rest of the game went 

much 
like 
that 
play: 
The 

Wolverines 
were 
one 
step 

ahead of Rutgers, scoring on 
five straight possessions in the 
first half and rolling to a 49-16 
victory at Michigan Stadium on 
Saturday.

Two plays after Houma’s 

catch, Rudock finished off the 
drive with a 13-yard touchdown

STUDENT GOVERNMENT

Law student finds 
loophole in body’s 

election code 

By JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily Staff Reporter

Super PACs — the political 

action committees with the 
ability to accept unlimited 
political contributions — are 
already playing a major role 
in the 2016 presidential race. 
But in advance of a midterm 
election for Central Student 
Government, a University law 
student has found an election 
code loophole that would allow 
people to funnel unlimited 
funds to CSG candidates.

Law 
school 
student 

John Lin, a former CSG 
general counsel, submitted 
a petition Thursday night 
to the University Elections 
Commission 
regarding 

the 
legality 
of 
student 

organizations formed for the 
sole purpose of funding CSG 
candidacies.

Lin said he filed the

petition to point out a hole in 
the CSG Election Code which 
allowed the creation of such 
an organization. To make his 
point, he founded LINPAC, 
which stands for Likeminded 
Individuals 
Networking 
to 

Passionately 
Advocate 
on 

Campus. He said under the 
current code, the organization 
could essentially operate like 
the PACs that fund state and 
federal elections.

“The decision to create it 

was literally a joke,” Lin said in 
an interview Sunday. “I figured 
it would be a good way to stay 
involved this term.”

He said the loophole was 

brought to his attention at 
the end of the last election 
cycle, and he figured forming 
a PAC of his own was the best 
method to inform the current 
CSG administration that the 
loophole needed to be closed.

In the petition, Lin stated 

there 
are 
currently 
no 

restrictions in the election code 
that prohibit the formation of 
an advocacy group to fundraise 
and produce advertisements 
for candidates of its choice. 
The 
current 
election 
code 

limits spending and donations 
for 
individual 
candidates, 

legislative 
campaigns, 

presidential tickets and parties, 
but he said LINPAC wouldn’t 
violate any of those provisions. 
He asked CSG for an opinion 
on whether his analysis was 
correct, which was ultimately 
denied.

Lin 
said 
his 
petition 

was influenced by Stephen 
Colbert’s Colbert Super PAC.

“I don’t intend on actually 

going through on any of it,” Lin 
said. “I just wanted to point 
out that there’s a hole someone 
should look into fixing.”

However, Lin said he can 

see reason to keep the loophole 
open.

“Obviously this is something 

that we allow in our federal 
elections,” he said. “If it’s 

something we allow at that 
level … maybe it should be 
constitution-protected at our 
level as well.”

The 
CSG 
Elections 

Commission 
had 
36 
hours 

to 
address 
Lin’s 
petition. 

Saturday, 
CSG 
Election 

Director Benjamin Reese, a law 
student, denied Lin’s request. 
In an e-mail, Reese said the 
counsel is already working 
on addressing the hole in the 
election code Lin’s petition 
acknowledges.

Reese said the petition raises 

questions 
about 
how 
First 

Amendment rights would apply 
to a campus election.

“This is getting into Citizens 

United territory, and whether 
money is speech and whether 
that decision applies to the 
campus context,” Reese said. 
“It’s going to require the 
commission to do a great deal 
of research to make sure that 
our opinion is very carefully 
phrased.”

Citizens United v. Federal 

Election Commission is a 2010 

U.S. Supreme Court decision 
that ruled the First Amendment 
prevents the government from 
curbing political spending by a 
nonprofit corporation.

Reese said it would be better 

if the commission issued an 
opinion under its own authority 
instead of simply responding to 
Lin’s.

“We 
are 
currently 
also 

considering the political action 
committee question on our 
own,” Reese said. “Because that 
is ongoing, we are not going to 
respond to petitions on that 
question right now because the 
advisory petition we ultimately 
issue will be more thorough 
and well-researched.”

The 
midterm 
elections, 

slated to take place Nov. 18 and 
19, will fill vacancies among 
representatives 
and 
select 

several specific positions on 
CSG, including a member of the 
Department of Public Safety 
Oversight Committee.

backgrounds.

Biswas 
was 
a 
Kathak 

performer — which is a north-
Indian classical style of dance. 
Biswas, who danced with two 
other girls, was part of the only 
Kathak group in the show. She 
has been dancing since she was 
seven years old and has been 
practicing the style of dance 
since she was 10.

Biswas said coming to the 

University and finding a group 
like Sahana has helped her 
continue keeping in touch with 
the art form and connecting 
with others who are passionate 
about it.

The 
dance 
her 
group 

performed is a Hindu prayer 
about the two reincarnations 
of Lord Vishnu, a Hindu deity.

“It’s important because so 

much of our dance is focused 
around Hinduism and there’s 
a lot of duality in Hinduism 
in the form of reincarnations 
of gods, which is what our 

dance is going to be showing,” 
she said. “Just in general, I 
think it’s just a really good 
theme because there’s so many 
different ways to explore it.”

Biswas has been part of 

every Sahana show since her 
freshman year but, like Rao, 
she said her final fall show was 
a bittersweet experience.

“I’m trying not to think too 

much about it,” she said. “When 
the 
board 
members 
were 

giving us a pep talk I realized 
I was getting emotional about 
it already, because it’s been so 
amazing just performing at 
every single show.”

Farmington residents Kiki 

Bayen and Carolyn Chow, who 
attended 
the 
performance, 

said they found the Sahana 
performance both educational 
and eye opening.

“It’s been a while since I’ve 

heard 
that 
much 
classical 

music in such a short amount 
of time,” Bayen said. “It’s 
really nice to be able to fully 
appreciate it as we’re older 
now and put it all of it into 
perspective.”

33 YEARS AGO THIS WEEK (NOV. 9 1982)

Black enrollment drops at ‘U’

THE LITE R ATI 

The University’s enroll-

ment figures reported that 
Black enrollment dropped 
to 4.7 percent, the lowest 
percentage since 1976. Uni-
versity’s 
various 
schools 

and colleges had varying 
degrees of success in halting 
the decline in Black enroll-
ment.

Significant drops were 

seen in the School of Educa-
tion, LSA, School of Public 
Health and School of Social 
Work. However, minority 
enrollment did increase by 
40 students in the School of 
Business.

The University set a goal 

in 1970 to reach a 10-per-
cent Black enrollment rate 

by 1973, but had not met 
this goal 12 years later. Dean 
Haefner, then the assistant 
dean of the Public Health 
School, said reductions in 
federal aid could have con-
tributed to the decline in 
minority 
student 
enroll-

ment.

Then-LSA 
Associate 

Dean Eric Rabkin said the 
University’s 
increasing 

tuition could make it more 
difficult to reverse trends in 
Black enrollment.

Though 
Black 
enroll-

ment decreased, both Asian 
and Hispanic enrollment 
increased, according to the 
registrar 
figures. 
Enroll-

ment of Native American 

students declined.

According to the Office 

of the Registrar, the Univer-
sity’s current Black student 
enrollment is 4.82 percent, 
slightly higher than it was 
in 1982.

‘Mrs. Doubtfire’ writer talks film career

Randi Mayem 
Singer discusses 
movie starring 
Robin Williams

By JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily Staff Reporter

Randi Mayem Singer, best 

known for writing the screenplay 
for the 1993 comedy “Mrs. Doubt-
fire,” starring Robin Williams and 
Sally Field, spoke to screenwrit-
ing students at the Modern Lan-
guages Building on Friday about 
her experiences as a screenwriter.

Singer, now a writer and pro-

ducer, said she first decided she 
wanted to write at age 13, but 
was unaware of opportunities 
in screenwriting. Singer studied 
political science at the University 
of California, Berkeley, with the 
intention of becoming a journalist.

She eventually took a job as a 

radio reporter for KMEL in San 

Francisco before moving to Los 
Angeles-based radio station, KFI. 
It was there Singer took a class 
at a UCLA Extension for screen-
writing. She later quit the station 
to write full time.

“It was scary, but you know, 

when you’re young I just knew 
that’s what I wanted to do,” she 
said.

Singer said her start with 

“Mrs. Doubtfire” gained her 
notoriety, especially in the cross-
dressing comedy genre.

“I like to joke if a man puts on 

a dress, I get a call,” Singer said.

James Burnstein, director of 

the Screenwriting Program in 
the Department of Screen Arts & 
Cultures, said he considers “Mrs. 
Doubtfire” the best family film 
ever made.

“I’ve learned over the years 

that ‘Mrs. Doubtfire’ is one of the 
very few movies that everyone has 
seen,” Burnstein said.

Burnstein said the film is incred-

ibly honest about the meaning of 
divorce. He noted the final scene 

in which the Robin Williams char-
acter drives off with the children. 
In a voice-over, he talks about how 
there are all kinds of families.

“It was just really clear to me 

what the movie was about,” Singer 
said. “It was about learning to co-
parent. Go back and watch the end-
ing in the context of where Robin 
Williams does not get back with 
Sally Fields. Now watch it in the 
context of the Supreme Court deci-
sion on gay rights and that movie is 
virtually prophetic at that moment 
in its discussion of all kinds of fami-
lies.”

Singer said when she was hired 

to write the screenplay, Robin Wil-
liams was already envisioned play-
ing the eponymous lead role.

Singer said it was rare that the 

actor initially attached to a script 
actually played the role, either 
because the studio didn’t end up 
having an interest in casting him 
or her, or the actor is committed to 
another project.

“This is the first movie I ever 

got made,” Singer said. “The guy 

that was attached looked at the 
script and said yeah he would do 
it. I just thought that happened all 
the time.”

Singer said having Williams 

on board with the project greatly 
impacted the writing process.

“He has a cadence to how he ... 

improvises, but in the dramatic 
scenes he doesn’t improvise at 
all,” she said.

Singer said she left the proj-

ect when the studio wanted the 
parents to get back together — an 
ending she said would have been 
an irresponsible message for chil-
dren of divorce. She eventually 
returned to the project when the 
studio reversed course.

“We amicably parted ways,” 

Singer said. “I came back when I 
was not quite as idealistic.”

Singer finished the talk with a 

message of advice for the next gen-
eration of screenwriter hopefuls.

“Good material finds a place,” 

Singer said. “Have a voice, read, 
read, read great screenplays. Have 
a sense of where the beats fall.”

research.”

He added the experience 

differs for each student. 

Though 
students 
are 

technically 
required 

to 
complete 
research 

participation 
in 

many 
psychology 
and 

communication 
studies 

classes, Campbell said there 
are 
alternative 
written 

assignments for the minority 
of students who decide not to 
participate.

“I think that’s an important 

component too; to provide 
students with a choice,” he 
said. “Students in my class, by 
and large, do not choose the 
alternative assignment.”

However, 
some 
students 

aren’t thrilled about this type 
of requirement. 

As a student in Psychology 

112, LSA freshman Spencer 
Marlow is required to either 
participate in research studies 
or 
write 
alternative 
essay 

assignments. 

“I feel like it doesn’t really 

add to the class or help me in 
any way,” Marlow said. “My 
experiences have been fine, 
but just boring and they don’t 
add anything to my knowledge 
of psychology. Studies could 
focus more on relating ideas 
they 
have 
to 
what 
we’re 

working on in the class.”

The 
studies 
Marlow 

participated in included a quiz 
about how he judged traits of 
people based on information 
about them and one aimed at 
understanding the effects of 
viewing specific pictures. 

According to the Psychology 

Department website, a large 
part 
of 
the 
department’s 

mission 
is 
to 
encourage 

research 
in 
creating 
new 

scientific 
knowledge 
and 

using graduate training to 
produce “tomorrow’s leading 
researchers.”

“As a research University 

we 
believe 
that 
active 

participation in all aspects of 
the research process provides 
students with a unique, hands-
on learning experience — deep 

learning 
experiences 
and 

opportunities 
that 
sharpen 

critical thinking skills,” the 
website reads.

Campbell said due to the 

University’s 
position 
as 
a 

major research institution, it’s 
important that students gain 
firsthand experience on how 
faculty conduct their work.

“They get the concept that 

by participating in research 
— by participating in actual 
studies — actual research 
and actual studies that result 
in 
publication, 
that 
are 

presented in classes, it gives 
them more of a hands-on 
experience, which is a much 
more direct understanding of 
how we go about doing our 
work,” he said.

LSA junior Sara Rochman 

said 
she 
learned 
valuable 

information from her research 
participation freshman year, 
yet did not always understand 
the overall premise of the 
research she was participating 
in.

“I definitely got a better 

understanding of how psych 
studies work,” Rochman said. 
“I really had no idea how that 
worked at all, how they got 
their data and since I was a 
participant I got an inside view 
into the process of research. 
But I didn’t really have a lot of 
information into what I was 
being studied on — what the 
purposes of the studies were. 
If they could have told me 
more, that would have been 
better.”

Campbell said implementing 

research 
components 
to 

introductory courses not only 
further educate students on 
class topics, but help them 
understand a key aspect of the 
University’s mission.

“The 
professors 
are 

helping to fulfill the mission 
of new discovery and the 
students 
are 
participating 

in the University’s mission 
of new discovery,” he said. 
“So in that sense, I think the 
students get some benefits 
out of it, the faculty gets some 
benefits out of it and the 
University gets some benefits 
out of it by helping it fulfill its 
mission.”

pass over the middle to redshirt 
junior 
wide 
receiver 
Jehu 

Chesson. He started the game 
after leaving last Saturday’s 
contest at Minnesota following 
a hard hit, and he responded 
with his best game of the 
season, completing 18 of 25 
passes for 337 yards and two 
touchdowns.

After the Wolverines held 

Rutgers to a field goal, the 
offense went to work on a nine-
play, 58-yard drive that lasted 
4:28 and ended with Rudock’s 
four-yard touchdown scramble. 
When the defense forced a 
three-and-out, Michigan had 
a chance to make it 21-3 and 
put the game away. This time, 
Peppers played the main role.

On 2nd-and-13 from the 

Rutgers 18, Rudock tossed the 
ball to him on a bubble screen. 
The Scarlet Knights sniffed 
out the screen in the backfield, 
but Peppers made a quick move 
past one defender and eluded 
the rest to scamper in for an 
18-yard touchdown.

“I thought that play was 

trapped behind the line of 
scrimmage,” said Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh. “The 
move he made, and then where 
he weaved himself through 
there, I knew he was good, 
but he’s really good. I thought 
there was not another rung to 
go on the ladder, but there is. 
He found another rung to go 
even higher.

“I told him that. I said, 

‘You’re really good.’ ”

As a whole, the Wolverines’ 

offense piled up 487 total 
yards, 304 in the first half, 
during which it held the ball 
for 18:51 and ran 32 of 42 
plays at midfield or in Rutgers 
territory.

Over the course of the game, 

the unit exhausted Rutgers’ 
defense. 
After 
the 
Scarlet 

Knights’ 
Janarion 
Grant 

returned a kickoff 98 yards for 
a touchdown to trim the deficit 
to 21-10, he also forced the 
defense back onto the field.

The Wolverines moved the 

ball at will again, this time 
scoring on redshirt junior 

running back Drake Johnson’s 
one-yard run. Michigan closed 
out its scoring for the half 
when Darboh pulled in a pass 
from Rudock in the end zone 
just before going out of bounds.

When play resumed, Rudock 

found junior tight end Jake 
Butt for a 56-yard catch-and-
run on the Wolverines’ first 
offensive play. Junior running 
back De’Veon Smith punched 
it in for the score, and Rudock 
ran for a two-point conversion 
to make it 43-16 and further sap 
the Scarlet Knights’ energy.

Rutgers (1-5, 3-6) mustered 

just three field goals aside 
from 
the 
kick-return 

touchdown. The last came as 
the first half expired after a 
67-yard punt return by Grant. 
Still, 
the 
Scarlet 
Knights 

became the third team in 
four games to leave Michigan 
Stadium without an offensive 
touchdown.

They faced an uphill battle 

from 
the 
outset 
playing 

without star wide receiver 
Leonte Carroo, and Michigan 
junior 
cornerback 
Jourdan 

Lewis didn’t make it any easier 
on them. He broke up two 
passes, giving him 19 for the 
season and passing former 
Wolverines Marlin Jackson 
and Leon Hall for the school 
record.

Senior safety Jarrod Wilson 

added an interception late 
in the second quarter. The 
defensive line made four sacks 
despite playing most of the 
game without redshirt junior 
Ryan Glasgow, who injured his 
shoulder in the first quarter. 
Harbaugh said after the game 
he was hopeful that it was a 
strain and not a tear.

Smith, who limped off the 

field in the fourth quarter 
at Minnesota, finished with 
15 carries for 73 yards and a 
touchdown. Peppers was also 
battling a thigh contusion after 
colliding with redshirt junior 
cornerback Jeremy Clark in 
practice Friday.

And while Rudock said 

after the game that nobody is 
100-percent healthy this late 
in the season, the Wolverines 
looked as close to their top 
form as they could be.

t’s not just the chill part; Internet ser-
vice providers are starting to take a page 
out of cellular service companies’ books 

and cap the amount of data 
allowed to be used in a pay 
period. Though it’s yet to 
hit 
Michigan, 
Comcast 

recently announced 300 
GB caps it would be plac-
ing on customers in certain 
zip codes as part of a trial 
period for the new strategy. 
The dreaded “You’ve used 
90 percent of your allotted 
data” text could now come 
twice as often.

It’s hard to frame the 

decision as anything more than a sheer 
money grab, as Comcast will simply charge 
additional fees for those going over the cap. 
Similarly, it’s hard to find any evidence that 
the 10 percent of customers that Comcast 
says uses most of its network resources are 
causing enough network congestion to war-
rant such a business decision. One of its own 
vice presidents even mentioned it was one of 
their “business policies” and did not know of 
any technical reason for the decision. For a 
50 Mbps Internet tier, a fairly standard high-
speed tier, saturating the connection for a 
mere 16 hours would cause you to hit their 
cap. As more people cut their cable TV cords 
and move to internet-based consumption, 
Comcast found a way to get that money back. 
They were already one of the most hated com-
panies in the country, and it certainly isn’t 
doing much to attempt to lose that title.

This is just the latest in a long list of com-

plaints against Internet service providers, 
which are hated even more than airlines. 
From low speeds, high prices for poor perfor-
mance and absurdly low customer satisfac-
tion, Internet companies are evil in the eyes 
of the customer.

Usually there’s a simple solution to dealing 

with a company providing a subpar service: 
Go somewhere else. Except with Internet ser-
vice providers, this simply isn’t possible. Take 
my student house in Ann Arbor, for exam-
ple. The only two Internet service provider 
options available are Comcast and AT&T, and 
the fastest speed offered by AT&T is simply 
too slow to provide adequate Internet usage 
for a house of nine people. Thus, there is only 
one reliable option. If the merger between 
Comcast and Time Warner Cable had gone 
through, it would have been the only avail-
able Internet service provider for about 40 
percent of the entire United States. 

The Internet has become an essential ser-

vice much in the same vein as electricity and 
water. Yet the system has developed into an 
oligarchy of Internet service providers and 
Tier 1 and Tier 2 network operators that 
control Internet traffic and are given a large 
amount of organizational control essential to 
controlling this necessary good, from every-
thing to its availability, its quality and its 
price. We regulate electricity and water, two 
other services that the Internet has now come 
to resemble in its necessity and distribution 
patterns, as public utilities. We would never 
let Nestle control public water distribution. 
The only way to move the Internet forward is 
to treat it as seriously as we do those indus-
tries and regulate it as such with government 
oversight on the quality and the price.

However, this problem is far more than 

just our necessity to stream more video. It’s 
not just access to movies and TV shows that 
is being threatened. It’s more than just lack 
of access to social media and other websites 
that dominate web usage. The Internet is the 
cornerstone of the exchange of information 
and the freedom of expression that drives 
and defines modern society, and our current 
system of accessing the Internet is prohibitive 
and fundamentally broken.

This lack of proper Internet quality and 

accessibility is also detrimental to increasing 
economic inequality and educational inequal-
ity among citizens. Forty percent of house-
holds in the city of Detroit have no Internet 
access. All the way back in 1999, the National 
Telecommunication and Information Admin-
istration called this “digital divide” one of the 
country’s “leading economic and civil rights 
issues.” Sixteen years later, we’ve only seen 
both the digital divide and education achieve-
ment gaps widen as wealthy districts have 
access to more resources and poor districts 
fall farther behind. The Internet has become 
the backbone of a large amount of informa-
tion access today, and when we fail to give 
anything close to equal access to the Internet 
to all citizens regardless of economic stand-
ing, it is only an additional way in which the 
country fails to provide equal educational, 
professional and social opportunities. 

Policies by the cable industry and Internet 

service providers have shown nothing more 
than the fact than the lengths they are willing 
to go to increase their profitability in leverag-
ing an essential service. Our country desper-
ately needs its own policies to improve both 
Internet quality and equality as it continues 
to become essential in the lives of citizens.

As a vegetarian, Meatless Mondays 

are convenient. I can eat whatever 
I choose in the dining hall that day, 
with more options than I normally 
have. This day makes me feel that 
the University is supportive of my 
dietary choices, which I have made 
to reduce my carbon footprint. While 
I enjoy these days, many grumble and 
moan, complaining about the walk to 
another dining hall. However, these 
objections are completely separate 
from the intent of Meatless Mondays. 
Implementing this day is a way for 
the East Quad Dining Hall to cut its 
carbon footprint and raise student 
awareness about the impact of the 
consumption of meat on the environ-
ment. This day allows the Michigan 
community to share in this effort, 
regardless of dietary preference.

Diet is a daily choice that has an 

enormous impact on the future of 
the Earth — this cannot be over-
looked, and students should not be 
ignorant of this fact. A vegetarian 
diet decreases an individual’s car-
bon footprint by 1485 kilograms 
of carbon dioxide annually. If just 
365 individuals were to eat all their 
meals at East Quad on this day, it is 
the same as one individual adopt-
ing a vegetarian diet for an entire 
year. In a Forbes article discussing 
the livestock industry’s greenhouse 
gas emissions, decreased meat 
consumption is cited as one of the 
most effective individual measures 
to prevent climate change. The 

same article estimated that 51 per-
cent of greenhouse gas emissions 
can be attributed to the livestock 
industry. The recent World Health 
Organization report linking meat 
consumption to cancer risk only 
adds another dimension to the edu-
cational opportunities associated 
with the implementation of Meat-
less Mondays. I commend Michigan 
Dining’s efforts to make students 
aware of the impact of their diets.

Educating students about the 

impact of their diets follows the 
University’s values. In its mission 
statement, the University states, 
“We look for tools and strategies to 
enhance sustainable practices in all 
facets of operations and seek to lead 
in the global quest for a sustainable 
future.” Furthermore, the Univer-
sity aims to foster “a community of 
learners.” The implementation of 
Meatless Mondays proves that these 
two values can go hand in hand. In 
this instance, the University is lead-
ing by proactively striving to achieve 
its mission.

I object to the argument that 

Meatless Mondays are an offense 
against student agency. Other din-
ing halls still offer meat on these 
days and are accessible to the stu-
dents who would prefer to follow 
an omnivorous diet. The Univer-
sity has the right to take measures 
to cut its carbon footprint and 
educate its students surrounding 
the environmental impact of meat 

consumption. After all, we are at 
this University to learn. We cannot 
selectively learn what is convenient 
or oppose advances for the reason 
of habit.

I will go one step further: I sup-

port the implementation of Meatless 
Mondays at all dining halls across 
campus. This would not be an attack 
on student liberty, but an oppor-
tunity for the University to make a 
statement about environmentalism 
and reinforce University values. As a 
University, we should practice envi-
ronmental stewardship and take 
measures to reduce our carbon foot-
print. Meatless Mondays are a great 
step forward on behalf of Michigan 
Dining. These days provide a way for 
the entire Michigan community to 
make a difference. It is the Univer-
sity’s responsibility to raise public 
awareness surrounding this issue 
specifically, as well as other envi-
ronmental issues. 

For these reasons, I object to the 

unfounded student attacks against 
the University’s leadership. Let’s 
get behind Meatless Mondays, 
rather than attacking a University 
initiative that benefits the environ-
ment and educates the University’s 
students. Meatless Mondays are 
an opportunity for us all to lead by 
example rather than an opportuni-
ty to complain and ignore an incon-
venient truth.

Luke Higgins is an LSA sophomore.

 “So verily, with the hardship, 

there is relief,” (Quran 94:5). 

I repeat this small quote from the 

Quran often — it has become my own 
little mantra, my own pep talk, as I 
try to take one more step forward. I 
have depression. I knew since I was 
11 years old that something wasn’t 
right. That the emptiness I felt inside 
wasn’t felt by my family and friends. 
It was a strange realization for me, as 
an 11-year-old, to acknowledge that 
sometimes I felt sad for no reason, and 
sometimes I didn’t want to see any-
one, and sometimes I thought about 
what it would be like if I didn’t exist.

It’s one thing to realize you have 

depression. It’s another to realize you 
have depression in a community that 
barely talks about mental health and 
where depression and anxiety aren’t 
seen as real illnesses. Those 
who suffer must do so alone.

Ten years later, I still strug-

gle with my depression, and 
many people in my life are 
unaware of the fact. I spend 
a lot of time actively hating 
myself, my body, the way I 
talk, the decisions I make, my 
own emotions and my faith. 
My greatest fear is losing con-
trol, and with depression, I 
never feel in control.

Having depression means 
I have trouble saying “no,” as I’ve 

established my self-worth with how 
much I can offer others.

Having depression means
Guilt. So much guilt. For feeling 

pain when my parents gave up their 
families, lifestyles and homes and 
crossed oceans and borders for me to 
be able to be here. For feeling my pain 
is superficial to theirs.

Having depression means
Sometimes hating my religion, 

because religion hasn’t fixed me. 
And sometimes hating my religion 
because I can’t hide it. Hating my 
scarf, something that feels like a sec-
ond skin to me, because I’ve been 
harassed countless time for it. I’m so 
overburdened with the responsibil-
ity of speaking for Muslims at work, 
in class and on the street that I can 
barely focus on my own spirituality.

Having depression means
Losing people, who can’t under-

stand why I act the way I act, and can’t 
understand when I need to step back.

Having depression means
Feeling so goddamn tired. Not 

being able to get out of bed, and not 
being able to work, study or see peo-
ple. And sometimes being so tired 
that I wish I hadn’t been born brown 
or raised Muslim so that I could hide 
in the background and have a minute 
of peace.

Having depression means
My heart, lungs and limbs all con-

strict as I’m struggling to breathe 

with ease.

Having depression means
Fearing that I will always be alone.
I’m exhausted by all the fear 

and burdens and trials. And those 
feelings are real manifestations of 
depression. I’m over hearing solu-
tions such as “learn to be grateful,” as 
if depression is a superficial problem 
stemming from a lack of gratuity. I 
am grateful for the undeniable luck 
of having a loving family and com-
munity. But the fact remains that I 
shouldn’t have to hide my depression 
to feel accepted or safe. I shouldn’t 
have to convince you that my depres-
sion has nothing to do with my lack of 
gratitude or willpower. Depression is 
real, and its treatment looks like very 
different things to different people. 
My time here at this University is 

comprised of my most difficult years, 
and I often struggle with doing any-
thing beyond surviving.

We talk about self-care and its abil-

ity to heal. But we don’t talk about 
how hard it is to recondition ourselves 
to learn that putting ourselves first 
when we’re suffering is not selfish. We 
come from communities that consis-
tently give, because we’re all forced to 
simultaneously prove our worth and 
attempt to survive, that it becomes 
second nature to put others before 
ourselves. To say that self-care cures 
depression would be a false embel-
lishment and an over-simplification of 
a complicated process. It hasn’t cured 
my depression. However, it has given 
me the agency to find moments of 
peace in spite of the depression. 

And it began. Attempting to stitch 

and piece myself back together 
again. To not only understand that 
I needed to take care of myself, but 
to get over my guilt of focusing on 
just myself and finally to put the 
time and resources into caring for 
myself. I had to acknowledge that 
I was burned out. And come to the 
understanding that being burned 
out is not synonymous with being 
weak. After years of consistently 
sacrificing my mental health, body 
and spirituality for things of little 
consequence, I learned to take care 
of myself. Whether it meant taking 
a break from meetings, reading out-
side, actively choosing to spend time 
with my friends instead of studying 

or taking a trip back home during 
the middle of the week, I learned to 
begin to prioritize myself, my needs 
and my wants. For someone who 
valued themselves by other’s estima-
tions, to come to the realization that 
my existence is not exclusively for 
the benefit of others was profound. 
So I move forward, and try to mend 
and rebuild myself in a way that val-
ues my own being.

I have been told by strangers, fam-

ily and friends that I am “too angry,” 
“too vocal,” “too intense,” “too emo-
tional” and “too sensitive.” And at 
times, I believe them to be true. But 
I have to remind myself that I am 
angry. I am vocal. I am intense. I 
am emotional. And these are things 
that I value about myself, and I will 
not be apologetic for them. These 

are traits that have shaped 
my being and beliefs. These 
do not limit me, as I am also 
capable of compassion, love 
and kindness. I will not be 
limited by single adjectives 
that are used to dictate and 
shame my behavior.

Trying to heal means 

changing my environment. 
It means removing people 
from my life who aren’t 
good for me. This has been 

perhaps one of the most difficult 
things I’ve had to do: actively cutting 
people from my life. This step causes 
me a lot of pain, a lot of what-ifs and 
a lot of second-guessing. This doesn’t 
mean I don’t care for them. It also 
doesn’t mean that I have to engage 
with them if it is harmful to my per-
son. It just means that I have been 
exhausted with being the collateral 
damage and I can’t let it continue. My 
body, my mind, my friendship and 
my love have no obligation to you or 
 

your desires.

Lastly, I began to let myself be fully 

loved by the support system I have. I 
began to believe that I was worthy of 
that love when I came to terms that it 
was OK to ask for help — that the alien-
ating feeling of depression doesn’t 
have to be as lonely as I thought. This 
small shift has helped me heal in 
healthier ways, and because of that I 
will forever thankful for my ami, dad, 
sisters and friends who have consis-
tently been there for me.

And so here I am, a brown Mus-

lim woman trying to figure out 
how to survive in a world not built 
for my existence and trying to fix 
myself piece by piece. I still struggle 
and relapse, and it is still incredibly 
hard to fully accept myself for who I 
am. And maybe, one day, I won’t be 
scared to publish this piece under my 
full name. Until then, I continue to 
wrap my hijab around my head, and 
try to lean into my next step, for ver-
ily, with every hardship, comes ease.

FROM THE DAILY

Fairer lines, better democracy

Michigan should adopt new anti-gerrymandering legislation
I

n this month of football and Blood Battle rivalry, we do not always 
give our neighbors to the south a lot of credit. But last week’s 
voter approval of a proposal to curb gerrymandering in Ohio’s 

legislative districts deserves our admiration, if not our jealousy.

Gerrymandering is the practice of drawing 

congressional 
or 
legislative 
districts 
to 

concentrate voters, primarily based on political 
party lines. These politically polarized districts 
often result in general elections in which the 
candidate of the majority party has no real 
competition, leading to fairly predictable 
election results. This practice endures because 
many states allow congressional and legislative 
districts to be drawn by partisan commissions.

Ohio’s voter-approved law, termed Issue 

1 on the ballot, takes a small step toward 
changing this democracy-threatening practice. 
It requires the commission that designates 
Ohio’s legislative districts to have at least 
two members from each party, and requires 
a bipartisan vote to approve district lines for 
10 years while limiting the duration of the 
district borders to four years in the absence of 
bipartisan support. It also amends the state’s 
constitution to require that district borders be 
drawn without favoring a party.

While 
these 
changes 
will 
not 
apply 

to congressional districts, they will still 
significantly 
impact 
Ohio’s 
political 

climate. It is now in the best interest of 
commissioners to draw borders based on a 
bipartisan consensus so the borders will be 
approved for a full 10 years, and so they can 
withstand a court challenge based on the new 
 

constitutional amendment.

Michigan can and should enact legislation 

that goes even further to affect congressional 
redistricting. In the 2014 election, Republicans 
in Michigan won nine out of 14 seats for the 

U.S. House of Representatives with only 47.5 
percent of the votes, while Democrats won only 
five seats despite winning 49 percent of the 
vote. This disparity is inexcusable and makes it 
increasingly difficult for Democrats to gain fair 
representation in the state.

The redistricting process in Michigan is 

currently controlled by the majority party of 
the state legislature. But in July, state Reps. 
Jon Hoadley (D–Kalamazoo) and Jeremy 
Moss (D–Southfield) reintroduced legislation 
to create a citizen-led bipartisan redistricting 
commission. If this legislation is passed, a 
bipartisan commission would be formed 
and composed of 14 members: five from the 
Democratic Party, five from the Republican 
Party and four with no party affiliation. Those 
who served as an elected official, lobbyist or 
party-elected official in the previous 10 years 
would be ineligible to serve on the commission.

The proposal would require two-thirds 

approval in both the State House and Senate, as 
well as statewide voter approval. Unfortunately, 
Representative Lisa Lyons (R–Alto), chair of the 
House Elections and Ethics Committee, has 
announced she will not allow the bill to see the 
light of day in her committee.

This is unacceptable. The fact that just 63 

percent of eligible Michigan voters cast ballots 
in the 2012 presidential election, with over 20 
percent fewer voting in 2014, demonstrates 
that voters feel disenfranchised by the 
political process. The only way hope can be 
restored in the political process is by putting 
elections back in the hands of voters.

TV NOTEBOOK
‘SNL’ plays a role 
in U.S. politics

‘SNL’ provides 
a platform for 

politicos

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Arts Writer

Donald Trump hosted this 

past week’s episode of “Saturday 
Night Live,” and the man who 
aims to “Make America Great 
Again” dominated the show, 
with nearly every act besides 
the 
prerecorded 
segments 

focused on the businessman-
cum-presidential 
candidate. 

Even sketches where he was not 
physically present, Trump stole 
the show, such as during the 
Weekend Update section when 
Drunk Uncle expressed his love 
for the candidate.

In many ways, Trump is the 

perfect host for “SNL.” With his 
unrestrained quips, trademark 
hair and maverick persona, even 
before his first (and only other) 
time hosting in 2004, the Donald 
and his likeness have been a sta-
ple on the sketch comedy series.

“Part of the reason I’m here 

is that I know how to take a 
joke,” Trump said in his open-
ing monologue. “They’ve done 
so much to ridicule me over 
the years; this show has been a 
disaster for me.”

But in others ways, he’s an 

unlikely choice, considering his 
strained relationship with the 
network. After his comments on 
undocumented Mexican immi-

grants in June, NBC cut ties with 
Trump — relinquishing his posi-
tion as host of “The Celebrity 
Apprentice” as well as refusing to 
air either of his beauty pageants: 
Miss U.S.A. and Miss Universe. 
Trump himself has even said the 
invitation to host was extended 
in the interest of ratings.

The public took note of this 

as well. Days before he was set 
to host, protesters marched 
outside of NBC in outcry to his 
comments.

Trump’s hosting takes on a 

new meaning — especially now 
as a Republican presidential can-
didate, considering the timeli-
ness of it. In recent weeks, for 
the first time since the election 
season began, his political adver-
saries have begun to narrow in 
on him in the polls. In the most 
recent FOX News poll released 
Wednesday, Trump was favored 
by 26 percent of Republicans 
with Dr. Ben Carson barely trail-
ing with 23 percent.

Presidential candidates have 

often used “SNL” to make them 
seem more personable to vot-
ers. Hillary Clinton recently 
appeared on the show as bar-
tender “Val” speaking to cast 
member Kate McKinnon play-
ing Clinton.

“SNL” provides a platform 

for candidates to openly address 
personal criticisms they often 
shy away from in the political 
realm. In Clinton’s latest sketch, 
she addressed criticisms that she 
is not very personal and retorted 
allegations that she waited too 

long to support key issues.

Trump’s show focused on his 

trademark (questionable) politi-
cal campaign strategies, such 
as his tendency to demean his 
opponents via tweet. One sketch 
depicted Trump tweeting criti-
cisms of cast members as they 
self consciously performed.

Long 
before 
Clinton 
and 

Trump, Gerald Ford was the first 
president to be on the show, when 
he said “Live from New York, it’s 
Saturday Night” in 1976. Howev-
er, the 2008 elections displayed 
the most fervor. That year “SNL” 
’s ratings jumped by 50 percent 
among all viewers.

Tina Fey as Sarah Palin and 

Amy Poehler as Hillary Clinton 
in the first episode of the 34th 
season set off a chain of events 
to unfold. With its dramatic 
upshot in ratings, “SNL” then 
established itself as a voice in 
the election.

Palin and Clinton both per-

sonally appeared on the show 
that season; a year before them, 
Barack Obama made an appear-
ance on the Halloween episode. 
But the prominent role the show 
held in the election was illus-
trated when, mere days before 
the polling booths would open, 
John McCain performed a sort 
of hail mary where he and Fey 
as Palin pretended to sell mer-
chandise from his campaign. 

Regardless, Trump is only 

the most recent iteration of a 
cultural legacy that pairs poli-
tics with pop culture with a 
dose of self aware humor. 

Goulding’s new LP 
should be forgotten

By CHRISTIAN KENNEDY

Daily Arts Writer

“Do you like Ellie Goulding?” 

Last week I would’ve said yes. 
This week, her second full-length 
album, Delirium, 
was 
released 

and plagued by 
pervasive 
rep-

etition, 
unin-

spired 
lyrics 

and 
inconsis-

tent production, 
Goulding 
has 

not lived up to 
the 
potential 

shown in previ-
ous hits like “Lights” and “Burn.”

Following an out-of-place intro, 

the majority of the 16-track LP 
consists of mediocre pop songs 
with choruses almost exclusively 
consisting of one or two phrases. 
“On My Mind,” the strongest 
of the album’s first four tracks, 
repeats the lyric “Why I got you 
on my mind” 28 times in three 
minutes and 33 seconds. And even 
though it’s the most repetitive of 
the album’s first quarter, its pol-
ished sound and catchy highlights 
the inferior aspects of preceding 
tracks “Aftertaste,” “Something In 
The Way” and “Keep On Dancin.’ ”

“Holding On For Life” follows 

the same pattern. In its final verse, 
the track goes as far as to repeat its 
title 15 times. Yes, 10 times. And 
then another five times. Fifteen. 
The chorus had potential — build-
ing with semi-consisted rhyming 
of “night,” “fight,” “ignite” and 
“light,” it sets itself up for a boom-
ing Calvin Harris-esque bass drop. 
Instead it regurgitates the same 

line with the same enthusiasm one 
would muster for a root canal. 

“Don’t Need Nobody” is the 

final song crippled in the name 
of repetition. The verses offer 
cohesive content through a fresh 
rhythm; however, the chorus 
effectively consists of the phrase, 
“I 
don’t 
need 
nobody, 
need 

nobody but you” manipulated and 
morphed through auto-tune, mov-
ing the sound between Goulding’s 
and maybe her angry alien coun-
terpart. It’s auditory overload and 
a distraction in and of itself.

“Around 
U,” 
while 
mildly 

repetitive, has moments of clarity, 
that showcase Goulding’s talent. 
Echoed moments where the auto 
tune diminishes leaving Gould-
ing’s raw sound are a pleasure, but 
the random repetition of certain 
lines in verses distracts from the 
lyrical content. While that content 
isn’t overwhelmingly interesting, 
at least it’s enough to actually war-
rant a complete song.

“Codes” is the album’s standout 

track. Goulding’s expert pacing 
isn’t as muddled with auto-tune, 
and it’s that minimalistic sound 
that entices listeners into the 
first verse and over the cliff of the 
chorus’s debut. The out of place 
delivery of the chorus’s first line is 
saved by the immediate change in 
pace. Delirium also hits its lyrical 
target in “Army.” At first listen, it 
isn’t anything special; it still suc-
cumbs to exhausting repetition, 
but lyrically, it’s touching, idealis-
tic and honest. It might just have 
people thinking about who their 
“Army” is.

“Love Me Like You Do,” as 

shown by its success, is a good pop 
song. The sound is original. Gould-
ing’s delivery hooks in listeners 
immediately, and it builds sonical-
ly and emotionally with each cho-
rus and verse, ultimately leading to 
the explosion of the final chorus. 
However, at this point, (I wrote 
about it 10 months ago) it feels like 
old news on a new album.

“Don’t Panic” and “We Can’t 

Move To This” are bad news on a 
new album. The former is a deep 

track of the album, known only 
to those who holistically love 
Delirium. However, as most of the 
album’s contenders for radio popu-
larity are plagued by their similar-
ity to a boom box that was knocked 
off a table, “Don’t Panic” further 
brings 
Goulding’s 
sophomore 

LP down. The island vibe of “We 
Can’t Move To This” is a welcome 
introduction into the album’s land-
scape, but that is all destroyed by 
the mixing of Goulding’s voice in 
the song’s chorus. It’s somewhere 
between four toddler-sized Ellie 
Gouldings and the representatives 
of the Lollipop Guild.

With two tracks remaining, it’s 

possible to see Goulding’s talent 
and sound come through with a 
strong finish. “Devotion” sounds 
like it should’ve been Delirium’s 
much-needed ballad. The lyrical 
work is set up for a Christina Perri-
esque ballad to remind everyone of 
Goulding’s raw talent. The instru-
mental intro gives hope, but almost 
immediately is layered under an — 
albeit not bad — sheath of synth, 
which is ultimately ruined by 
the cheap dance floor echoes at 
the end of the chorus. Just as I’m 
getting over the non-balladness 
of “Devotion,” the first chorus 
of album closer “Scream It Out” 
offers me hope. It isn’t great, but 
maybe it will build into something 
stunning and truly worthy of a 
high-profile pop album. Sadly, that 
isn’t the case. “Scream It Out” only 
builds itself to an inferior version 
of Rachel Platten’s “Fight Song.” 
The commitment to the chorus is 
absent. The screaming is purely 
lyrical rather than audible.

Delirium isn’t the album Ellie 

Goulding will be remembered 
for. Frankly, it should be the one 
we forget. It has moments of 
greatness, but the majority of its 
incompetence is a direct result of 
its lyrical base, production or mis-
match of the two. When Gould-
ing’s vocal chops take priority 
over the song’s production are the 
album’s highest peaks, ensuring 
her talent despite the general mis-
step of the record.

‘Room’ grips

FILM REVIEW

By REBECCA LERNER

Daily Arts Writer

“Good morning, bed … Good 

morning, skylight.” As five-year-
old Jack (Jacob Tremblay, “Before 
I 
Wake”), 

goes about his 
morning routine, 
he 
introduces 

the inside of a 
backyard 
shed, 

his home and the 
only world he’s 
ever known.

“Room” is a story that eschews 

definitive articles — there is no 
need for “the” when Jack refers to 
the inanimate objects of his min-
iature world. To Jack, every bed, 
lamp and toilet in his universe is a 
living being and a friend.

Jack lives in Room with his 

mother, Ma (Brie Larson, “Train-
wreck”). What Jack doesn’t know 
about, and what keeps alive Ma’s 
creation of the fairytale magic of 
Room, is that there is another side 
to the walls that keep them captive. 
In order to protect Jack, Ma tells the 
story of being abducted and held in 
a shed for seven years in a very dif-
ferent way. When Ma says that Jack 
zoomed from heaven through the 
skylight to save her, he believes her. 
It’s easy to believe — with his happy 
lightness and androgynous beauty 
of the very young, it often feels like 
Tremblay saves the audience from 
catapulting into the horror of what 
has happened.

While 
“Room,” 
Emma 

Donoghue’s critically acclaimed 
novel from which the eponymous 
film is adapted, is told from Jack’s 
point of view, our exposure to the 
hell that Ma has gone through 
is not limited. Their captor 
abducted her while she was 
walking in her neighborhood 
at seventeen and held in Room 
for seven years. Their captor, 
known only as Old Nick, comes 
nightly to rape Ma while Jack 
hides in the closet, covering his 

ears and counting until it’s over. 
This is quickly established as a 
disturbing barter system, as Ma 
accepts Old Nick’s cruel criticism 
and sexual abuse to provide food 
and clothes for her son. But when 
the situation escalates and Old 
Nick’s maltreatment is no longer 
tolerable, Ma realizes she must 
find a way out.

The movie splits down the 

middle and the second half is 
located outside of their prison. 
But to tell any more about this 
would be a disservice, as the 
gripping emotions of fear and 
anxiety create the tension that 
makes the film great.

Director Lenny Abrahamson 

(“Frank”) creates a world both 
claustrophobic and vibrant in 
Room. The camera seems to shift 
when it’s looking at Jack and Ma, 
as Jack’s view of possibilities in 
Room is illustrated in the long 
and wandering tours he gives. 
But Larson’s portrayal of Ma dis-
plays the cramped reality of the 
space and of her life as a single 
parent. She is enthusiastic and 
joyful when playing with Jack 
but there is emptiness to her that 
only the life she was forced to 
leave can fill.

The film implores us to think 

about not just the monstrosi-
ties that could be occurring in 
our neighbor’s backyards, but to 
reflect on growing up and the loss 
of time. There is comfort in the 
small world and physical close-
ness that Jack and Ma are forced 
to accept. When Ma tells Jack the 
truth, that there is a world out-
side of Room, he is scared and 
reluctant to leave, shouting, “I 
want a different story!” To which 
Ma grimly responds, “This is the 
story you get.”

“Room” is the story we get. 

As it unfolds, we are trapped 
by its narrative and its compel-
ling cast. We have no choice but 
to experience it with the same 
claustrophobia as its characters.

Arts
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

“Parents” focuses on Dev 

and his friend Brian (newcomer 
Taiwanese-American 
actor Kelvin Yu) and their 
generational 
gap 
between 

their hard-working, immigrant 
parents. “Hot Ticket” presents 
Dev’s 
date 
gone 
wrong 

as 
an 
examination 
of 
the 

unexpected pitfalls of romantic 
relationships. 
Despite 
how 

most topics covered on “Master 
of None” are used in Ansari’s 
stand-up 
and 
best-selling 

book 
“Modern 
Romance,” 

the dialogue on the show still 
sounds 
rich 
and 
authentic, 

evoking a naturalistic style 
reminiscent of works by Woody 
Allen and Richard Linklater.

When watching “Master of 

None,” it’s easy to draw parallels 
to Louis C.K.’s acclaimed meta-
satire “Louie” and Chris Rock’s 
star-studded 
comedy 
film 

“Top Five.” Each primarily 
takes place in New York City, 
uses 
innovative 
aesthetic 

techniques and features famous 
celebrities 
as 
exaggerated 

versions of themselves. Rock, 
C.K. and Ansari also write 
and act in their own work, 
playing characters who embody 
the traits of their creators. 
However, “Master of None” is 
noteworthy in its own right. It’s 
not as cynical as “Louie” nor as 
flashy as “Top Five.” “Master of 
None” simply combines the best 
qualities of both and adds its 
own distinctive flare.

Visually, “Master of None” is 

incredible to look at. It employs 

a 
warm 
color 
palette 
that 

saturates the streets of New 
York and scenes of Nashville 
from 
the 
Ansari-directed 

episode 
“Nashville.” 
The 

show also boasts an incredible 
soundtrack that includes music 
by Mac DeMarco, Lou Reed, 
Father John Misty, Broken Bells 
and Beach House. Ironically, 
Beach House’s dreamy tune 
“Master of None” is used in one 
episode, possibly as a tongue-in-
cheek nod to the show’s title. In 
addition to the gorgeous visuals 
and outstanding music choices, 
“Master of None” enlists a 
fantastic cast of talented actors: 
Eric Wareheim (“Tim and Eric 
Awesome Show, Great Job!”) 
plays Dev’s dorky single friend 
Arnold; Noël Wells (“Saturday 
Night Live”) plays Dev’s love 
interest Rachel; screenwriter 
Lena 
Waithe 
plays 
Dev’s 

deadpan lesbian buddy Denise; 
Ravi 
Patel 
(“Transformers”) 

and H. Jon Benjamin (“Archer,” 
“Bob’s Burgers”) play Dev’s 
actor friends. Even Claire Danes 
(“Homeland”), Danielle Brooks 
(“Orange is the New Black”) 
and rapper Busta Rhymes make 
some 
unusually 
delightful 

cameos. Ansari manages to 
craft these characters as three-
dimensional 
and 
intriguing 

people, rather than portraying 
them as superficial, clichéd 
caricatures. Surprisingly, each 
side character also seems to have 
natural chemistry with Ansari, 
especially the lovely Wells.

While “Master of None” 

delivers Ansari’s topical humor, 
the show challenges viewers 
with socially relevant issues 
as well. In the seventh episode 

“Ladies 
and 
Gentlemen,” 

feminism and sexism come to 
light as Dev gradually comes 
to 
understand 
the 
double 

standards women face in today’s 
society. In the standout episode, 
“Indians on TV,” Dev ruminates 
over the misrepresentation and 
stereotypes of Indians seen in 
television and movies, citing 
Ashton Kutcher’s brownface in 
a Popchips commercial as an 
example. In one pivotal scene, 
Dev auditions for the role of 
“unnamed cab driver,” where 
he is reluctant to use an Indian 
accent when asked. “You know, 
Ben Kingsley did an (Indian) 
accent in Gandhi and he won 
the Oscar for it, so … ” the 
casting director remarks. “But 
he didn’t win the Oscar just for 
doing the accent,” Dev retorts. 
“I mean, it wasn’t an Oscar 
for Best Indian Accent.” This 
exchange not only showcases 
Ansari’s quick-witted humor, 
but also underscores the casting 
director’s microaggression as 
an example of how the industry 
undermines people of color in 
acting roles. These are just one 
of the many instances in “Master 
of None” that exhibit Ansari’s 
range 
as 
a 
groundbreaking 

actor and writer.

“Master of None” is a classic 

coming-of-age story, but Ansari 
perfectly nails every facet of 
a young person’s life, whether 
it’s discovering new things, 
falling in love or thinking 
deeply about the world we live 
in. One thing is for sure: Ansari 
may be a “master of none,” but 
based on this show alone, he 
has the potential to become the 
“master of everything.”

The finer points of 
reading for pleasure

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK

By BAILEY KADIAN 

Daily Arts Writer

There’s no doubt that, at this 

point of my life, time is limited. I 
have a never-ending to-do list and 
as a result, I surrender one of my 
most treasured and beloved hob-
bies — reading for pleasure.

By no means am I suggest-

ing that I have been deprived of 
reading. My syllabi provide me 
loads of reading opportunities. I 
have enough textbook reading to 
last me the rest of the semester. 
But reading for pleasure? I have 
put that off for months now, and 
I have been deprived of delight-
ing in this hobby. So I decided to 
write about it.

I miss my reading chair, my 

reading lamp, my infinite stack of 
books begging me to spend hours, 
days, weeks reading them. I miss 
going to Barnes & Noble, stocking 
up on books and actually reading 
what I have so meticulously picked 

out. I miss the satisfaction of con-
cluding an engrossing and capti-
vating story, just to be instantly 
transported into another.

As I flashback to the days of ele-

mentary school, I catch a glimpse 
of the opportunities for pleasure 
reading that I didn’t appreciate. 
Our allotted afternoon reading 
time, our library trips, our book 
fairs — my third grade self didn’t 
know this precious time would be 
taken away and nearly impossible 
to get back.

On Fridays, I go to an elementa-

ry school in Detroit and read with 
fourth grade students. My visits 
with them remind me how amaz-
ing literature is. Every student 
gets something different out of 
the story, but they are all equally 
excited and passionate about their 
discoveries. If I can’t read for fun 
on my own, at least I can enjoy 
my time watching them do so. For 
now, reading through children’s 
books is all I have. 

From May to August, during 

the long-awaited summer vaca-
tion, I’m driven to read as many 
books as I can without assign-
ments hindering this pursuit. 
The satisfaction tends to wear 
off a few months into the semes-
ter, when I know it has been too 
long since I’ve done this. We’ve 
reached that point.

My reading for pleasure is 

equivalent to the rest of the pop-
ulation’s love for TV series and 

movies. I don’t binge watch TV, 
I binge-read books — and having 
to do without this hobby for most 
of the academic year is more than 
disappointing. It’s defeating.

The problem is that even if I 

make time for some light reading, 
it’s just not the same. Part of the joy 
derived from pleasure reading is 
the peace of knowing that is all you 
have to do. Hours and hours filled 
with reading books of my choice, 
like prose, historical fiction, even 
plays. The freedom and bliss of this 
hobby is found in your willingness 
and ability to enjoy it.

For now, I’ll just have to con-

tinue piling my list of “must read” 
books, like Harper Lee’s “Go Set 
a Watchman,” Tolstoy’s “Anna 
Karenina” and maybe even round 
two for “Harry Potter,” when the 
opportunity presents itself to 
indulge. Until then, I’ll just have 
to enjoy some reading of “Psy-
chology: From Inquiry to Under-
standing.”

Daily Arts Writer

Last November, I penned 

an open letter to Frank Ocean, 
pleading with him to fill us in 
on where he’s been, what he’s 
doing and, most importantly, 
when some new material would 
drop. 
On 
Thanksgiving, 
he 

released the short and unsatis-
fying “Memrise,” showing his 
first signs of independent artis-
tic life since CHANNEL Orange. 
Though the rest of 2014 was rel-
atively quiet, 2015 looked bright: 
he released another short song 
in January, and then in April, 
announced 
his 
new 
album 

would be out in July.

Well, now it’s July fucking 

129th and still nothing. The 
initial announcement of his 
new album was made on his 
Tumblr and featured a photo 
of the artist sitting with stacks 
of magazines titled “Boys Don’t 
Cry,” with the caption, “I got 
two versions. I got twoooo 
versions. #ISSUE1 #ALBUM3 
#JULY2015 #BOYSDONTCRY.” 
So not only was Frank teas-
ing a new album, but also an 
apparent new publication. Both 
seemed to be titled “Boys Don’t 
Cry.” But who knows, because 
we never got either of them.

As the days in July dwin-

dled down, fans continued to 

hold out hope. Even as August 
opened, the Internet was quick 
to defend Frank; he liked doing 
things on his own time, like 
in 2011, with nostalgia, Ultra, 
when he was feeling ignored by 
Def Jam and just went ahead 
and released the album with-
out a label. And though Ocean 
remained silent, his mother was 
tweeting to fans about patience, 
and his ex-girlfriend confirmed 
the completion of the album.

But things got personal for 

me when Ocean canceled his 
performance at FYF in late 
August. Two days before he 
was set to perform, the festi-
val released a statement say-
ing that he had “decided on his 
own terms to cancel his appear-
ance,” making it very clear this 
was his doing and not theirs. 
There was talk of him being 
in London trying to finish his 
album. But, like, what the fuck? 

Though I wasn’t one of those 
people that bought a $200 ticket 
solely to see him perform, and 
though his replacement was one 
of my favorite artists of all time, 
Kanye West, he couldn’t just do 
that! Yes, I may have literally 
cried when Kanye performed 
“Runaway,” 
but 
I 
probably 

would have cried when Ocean 
performed “Bad Religion,” too. 
I guess we’ll never know.

August 
passed 
with 
an 

announcement that Ocean had 
signed with a new PR agency. 
September brought a sighting 
at a sushi restaurant in SOHO 
— at least we know he’s alive — 
and some talk that Yung Lean 
would appear on the album. 
In late October, his barber, of 
all people, said the album was 
coming soon. All the while, his 
website has been mysteriously 
taken down, changed from 
frankocean.com to boydont-
cry.co, and then put back up. 
There’s been a merch tab added 
and a different font used, but 
absolutely no word on the new 
projects.

I get that we have to respect 

the creative process, but Ocean 
is being kind of an asshole. He’s 
gotta’ give us something to look 
forward to, or we’ll all begin 
giving up. I’ll hold out until the 
end of 2015, then I might have 
to move on.

DEF JAM

“I’ve been thinking bout’ you ... you’ve been thinkin’ bout me too. Lol.”

I miss my 

reading chair, 

my reading 

lamp.

Where in the world 
is Frank Ocean?

I don’t binge 
watch TV, I 
binge-read 

books.

Respect the 

creative process, 

but Ocean is 

being an asshole.

Rudock’s toughness on display 

in career-high performance

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

Jake Rudock was expected to play, but he wasn’t 

expected to play like that.

The fifth-year senior quarterback sustained 

a rib injury a week ago against Minnesota, a hit 
that Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh likened to a 
car accident. The Wolverines’ coaching staff was 
optimistic he would be able to play against Rutgers 
on Saturday, and did he ever.

Even though he wasn’t at 100-percent health, 

Rudock played his best game of the season against 
the Scarlet Knights, racking up a career-high 337 
passing yards and scoring three total touchdowns 
in Michigan’s 49-16 win.

“He was just on fire,” Harbaugh said. “He had a 

great game, making all the appropriate throws, all 
the right reads.”

Ironically, Rudock started the game on a miscue. 

Michigan’s first play from scrimmage was a toss to 

redshirt junior running back Drake Johnson, but 
Johnson couldn’t collect the toss, and Rutgers fell 
on the ball, thinking it had recovered a fumble.

But the officiating crew reviewed the play and 

determined the toss had actually been a forward 
pass, and thus an incompletion.

So Rudock started the game 0-for-1. It was one 

of the few mistakes he made all day.

After leading the Wolverines deep into Rutgers 

territory on the first drive, only 
to come away with a missed field 
goal, Rudock found paydirt on 
the next drive.

A play-action fake to redshirt 

freshman Jabrill Peppers left 
senior fullback Sione Houma 
open down the sideline. Rudock 
hit his streaking fullback, then 
found redshirt junior receiver 
Jehu Chesson in the end zone 
two plays later.

But his most impressive play 

of the night came on the Wolverines’ next drive. 
On 3rd-and-goal from the four-yard line, Rudock 
didn’t have any of his receivers open. Forced out 
of the pocket, Rudock turned up field and put his 

body on the line as he dove into the pylon for a 
touchdown.

“That’s a courage play, too,” Harbaugh said. “I 

mean, I’ve been in that situation. When he makes 
that turn up the boundary, you know they’re 
coming. Everybody’s coming, and they’re coming 
for that spot at the pylon, the one-yard line and the 
pylon, to keep you out of there.

“He knew that, I guarantee you he knew it, and 

he stuck his nose in there and 
gave no quota whatsoever on the 
entire play.”

Toughness 
and 
courage 

were the themes of the day for 
Rudock, who finally exited the 
game with 11 minutes remaining 
and his team up by 33.

“Jake’s a very tough guy,” 

Harbaugh said. “I mean, he’s 
tough as a two-dollar steak, and 
he continues to show that.”

Rudock’s 
career-best 
337 

yards came on just 25 attempts, less than half as 
many (52) as he needed for his previous career high 
of 322 yards when he was at Iowa.

He spread his 18 completions around to 10 

different players, continuing a trend he has 
displayed all season. And while he didn’t have 
to throw any deep passes, he still had plenty of 
completions go for big yardage, a facet in which 
he’s not known for excelling.

Houma’s catch down the sideline went for 32 

yards. Redshirt junior running back De’Veon 
Smith caught a delayed screen and took it 31 yards, 
and junior tight end Jake Butt gained 56 yards on 
a pass over the middle. It was Rudock’s longest 
completion of the season, fitting for his most 
impressive game.

“I think that you get those games,” Rudock said. 

“If you can see the ball get completed, and then 
completed, and then if you’re seeing the ball well, 
that’s a big thing.”

All things considered, Rudock’s big day did come 

against one of the nation’s worst pass defenses, 
exploiting a secondary that has given up nearly 
300 yards per game this season.

But in a game he wasn’t a lock even to start, 

the fact that Rudock stood tall says a lot about the 
quarterback.

“Toughness is respected by everyone who plays 

this game and watches it,” Harbaugh said. “And 
he’s got it.”

Junior cornerback 

passes Marlin 

Jackson, Leon Hall 
for all-time mark

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

When 
Michigan 
defensive 

coordinator D.J. Durkin arrived 
alongside Jim Harbaugh last 
winter, he noticed a flaw in 
the 
defense 
he 
inherited. 

The Wolverines’ defense had 
struggled to create turnovers 
in 
2014, 

something 
Durkin 
felt 
was 

unacceptable.

So 
Durkin 

implemented 
a 
reward 

system, 
one 

that 
started 

in 
spring 

practice, 
to 

incentivize 
his defensive players to get their 
hands on the ball. Whenever 
they make a big play on defense, 
usually 
a 
turnover, 
Durkin 

rewards them with a new piece 
of clothing that says “Ball 
Hawk” on it.

Though 
the 
Wolverines 

constantly 
say 
they 
aren’t 

satisfied with their turnover 
statistics 
— 
they 
entered 

Saturday’s game ranked 111th in 
the NCAA in forced turnovers 
— Durkin’s methodology has 
become embedded in the minds 
of his players.

Senior safety Jarrod Wilson 

said the first thought in his mind 
after his diving interception in 
the second quarter was that he 
would be receiving some new 
“Ball Hawk” gear.

Perhaps 
nobody 
embodies 

Durkin’s philosophy better than 
Jourdan Lewis. No Wolverine 
has gotten his hands on the 
ball as frequently as the junior 
cornerback. Ever.

Though 
he 
doesn’t 
have 

a 
jaw-drapping 
number 
of 

interceptions this season (two), 
Lewis has now broken up more 
passes in a single season than 
any other player in Michigan 
football history.

When Lewis broke up Rutgers 

quarterback 
Chris 
Laviano’s 

heave on 4th-and-7 from the 
Michigan 18-yard line late in 
the third quarter, it was his 
19th pass breakup of the season. 
He passed former Michigan 
defensive backs Marlin Jackson 
and Leon Hall when he set the 
milestone.

“It feels good,” Lewis said. 

“Being 
named 
with 
some 

of those legends, it’s a good 
feeling.”

Saturday 
wasn’t 
Lewis’ 

flashiest 
defensive 
game 
of 

the season. He returned an 
interception for a touchdown 
against 
Northwestern 
and 

recorded six pass breakups 
against Michigan State. But 
when the ball came his way, 

it rarely turned out well for 
Rutgers. Lewis broke up two 
passes 
and 
recorded 
three 

tackles.

In addition to his defensive 

performance, Lewis returned 
kicks for Michigan for the first 
time this season. He filled the 
spot next to redshirt junior wide 
receiver Jehu Chesson that is 
normally occupied by redshirt 
freshman safety Jabrill Peppers.

Peppers has broken multiple 

long returns throughout the 
season, 
presenting 
a 
threat 

nearly every time he opts to 
return the ball. Lewis ensured 
that Peppers’ absence on the 

kick 
return 

unit was not 
an issue.

He 

returned 
his 

two 
kickoffs 

for 59 yards. 
On his longer 
return 
of 

35 yards, he 
allowed 
the 

Wolverines 
to 
take 

over 
possession 
on 
their 

own 42-yard line. Michigan 
marched down the field and 
scored. Lewis joked after the 
game that Peppers, who had a 
thigh contusion, might not get 
his job back.

“Jabrill’s a great player, but 

it would be hard to get that job 
back,” Lewis said, laughing.

Lewis liked the feeling of 

having the ball in his hands, 
something that hasn’t happened 
consistently since he played 
offense and special teams in 
high school.

Lewis got his hands on the 

ball on the other end of special 
teams, too. He was serving as a 
gunner on the kickoff team when 
he made contact with Rutgers 
returner Janarion Grant late in 
the first quarter. Lewis got his 
hand on the ball and stripped 
Grant, causing a scrum for the 
loose football.

The 
Scarlet 
Knights 

recovered, but by stifling Grant, 
Lewis 
had 
done 
what 
the 

Wolverines struggled to do for 
most of Saturday’s game.

When 
the 
blowout 
was 

complete, 
Lewis 
maintained 

the same disposition he has 
held for most of the season. 
He expects nothing less than 
excellence out of Michigan’s 
defensive unit, the secondary 
in particular. He said the unit 
could be the nation’s best in the 
country early in the season, and 
his expectations for his position 
group are consistently based on 
that notion.

He is not surprised that 

opposing offenses still test him, 
despite how infrequently their 
attempts are fruitful. He will 
have at least four more games to 
tack on to his record.

“It’s a game, they have to 

score points, they’ve got to put 
points on the board, so trying 
me is trying to put points on 
the board,” Lewis said. “I’ve got 
to do my job, because I know 
they’re going to do theirs.”

SPORTSMONDAY COLUMN
In the Big House, Woodson’s 

father like everyone else

O

n home football 
Saturdays, Yvonne 
Alaniva sits in Section 10 

at Michigan Stadium, toward the 
end of her row. She greets those 
who enter 
with a smile, 
saying hello 
as they walk 
to their seats.

For many 

years, she 
had done 
the same 
with the 
man who sits 
three seats 
to her left, 
never knowing who he was. But 
then, one Saturday, an image of 
Charles Woodson flashed over 
the Big House video boards.

“That’s my boy!” the man 

yelled.

So Alaniva, in an attempt 

to support one of the three 
Heisman Trophy winners in 
Michigan football history, 
hollered, “That’s our boy!”

The man turned to Alaniva and 

said, “No, that’s really my boy!”

The man, it turned out, was 

actually Solomon Woodson, 
father of Charles.

Few Michigan players have 

accomplished as much as his 
son, both in college and the 
NFL. Yet on Saturdays in Ann 
Arbor, Solomon is just like 
everyone 
else, 
tailgating 
with his 
friends from 
the early 
morning until 
game time.

He was in 

his usual seat 
for Saturday’s 
rout of 
Rutgers. 
No sign of his bloodline was 
evident as he took his place in 
the stadium. A baseball cap with 
a block ‘M’ revealed his rooting 
preference.

Solomon Woodson attends 

every Michigan home game, and 
says he has ever since Charles’ 
college career began. He makes 
the trek from Fremont, Ohio, 
where he raised Charles. His 
friends from home, 20 years later, 
still poke fun that his son chose 
the Wolverines over Ohio State.

But Solomon Woodson’s love 

of Michigan predates his son’s 
playing career, which started 

in 1995. It goes all the way 
back to 1968, when the elder 
Woodson was not a fan of how 
the Buckeyes ran up the score 
against the Wolverines in a 
50-14 victory.

“I was a Michigan fan before 

Charles and after Charles,” he 
said.

And Woodson still roots for 

the Wolverines as vigorously 
as he did when Charles played 
in Ann Arbor. Sure, his favorite 
Michigan football memories 

come from his 
son’s career, 
specifically 
his Heisman 
Trophy season 
in 1997. He’ll 
never forget 
the sideline 
interception 
against 
Michigan 
State or the 
interception 

in the end zone against Ohio 
State that helped the Wolverines 
win their most recent national 
title.

It doesn’t hurt that Charles 

is still doing his thing, either. 
He’s on the other side of 
the country, having another 
stellar season for the Oakland 
Raiders. He’s 39 years old now, 
18 seasons removed from his 
Heisman Trophy season, but 
he still displays the ability that 
he showed at Michigan. The 
younger Woodson entered 
Sunday’s NFL games as the 
league leader in interceptions 

with five. He is considered one 
of the elder statesmen in the 
league, one of three players — 
along with Peyton Manning and 
Matt Hasselbeck — remaining 
from his draft class. He has 
made eight Pro Bowls and has 
been named First-Team All-Pro 
by the Associated Press on three 
occasions.

But when Solomon Woodson 

watches his son play, Charles 
is still the high schooler who 
he says once scored seven 
touchdowns in seven different 
ways. He gets the same joy 
watching his son play as he did 
back then. He doesn’t get to see 
him play in person very often 
(he hasn’t gone to Oakland yet 
this season), but he is in awe of 
his son’s accomplishments.

He knows few players last 

until age 39 in the NFL, and his 
son’s significant contributions 
at that age surprise even him, 
just like Charles’ superstardom 
surprised Solomon Woodson 
when he was in high school.

“Oh yeah, no doubt about it,” 

Woodson said. “I can still see 
the high school in him because 
there’s a lot of things he did in 
high school I couldn’t imagine 
how he’d do that.”

There is another person in 

whom Solomon Woodson sees a 
lot of Charles. That, of course, is 
Jabrill Peppers. The comparison 
has become trite at this point. 
Like Charles Woodson did, 
Peppers plays both ways and 
makes defenders look silly, 
just like he did on his 18-yard 

touchdown run in Saturday’s 
game.

He particularly sees some of 

his son in Peppers on defense, 
when he chases down offensive 
players who already passed 
him, making tackles nobody 
thought he had any business 
making.

“I see a lot of potential,” 

Woodson said of Peppers. “I see 
a lot of agility. He’s got speed, 
and his head is always in the 
game.”

He is not alone in that feeling. 

Even Charles himself has 
congratulated Peppers on social 
media for his performances this 
season. The two have developed 
a friendship of sorts.

Peppers has served as a 

symbol of hope for Michigan 
fans, a sign that the times 
of being outmanned and 
outclassed are gone. Solomon 
Woodson remembers those 
times, too. He was there, in his 
seats at the Big House.

But Saturday afternoon, 

as the band played and the 
Wolverines readied to take the 
field, it was as though the down 
years never happened. Solomon 
Woodson is thoroughly enjoying 
this season.

His favorite part? Jim 

Harbaugh.

The father of one of 

Michigan’s greatest players 
really is just like everyone else.

FOOTBALL

FILE PHOTO/Daily

Charles Woodson won the Heisman Trophy at Michigan, and to this day, his father, Solomon, attends every home game.

Even in blowout, 
Harbaugh fired up

E

veryone knows how 
blowouts work. Through 
efficient offense and a 

stout defense, a team builds a big 
lead. Then 
the team pulls 
its starters, 
closes the 
playbook and 
safely high-
steps into 
victory for-
mation.

Rarely do 

they involve 
temper 
tantrums, 
livid halftime speeches or two-
point conversions. But then again, 
Jim Harbaugh is a rare breed.

Less than a quarter into 

Saturday’s game, the Michigan 
coach and his staff had done 
their jobs. Rutgers has been an 
embarrassment on and off the 
field this season, and looked the 
part Saturday.

Jake Rudock had a career day 

despite still recovering from a 
rib injury, Michigan’s defense 
didn’t allow a touchdown and 17 
Wolverines had a catch or carry 
en route to the team’s largest 
offensive output of the season. 
Whatever Michigan’s game plan 
was, it worked.

No matter what angle you look 

at the game from, the Wolverines 

cruised from start to finish, 
moving one step closer to their 
postseason aspirations.

Michigan thoroughly drove the 

Scarlet Knights into the ground, 
but Harbaugh refused to coast.

“Maybe from where you were 

sitting it seemed like a lopsided 
(game), but from where I was 
standing with 
the kickoff 
returns and 
punt returns ... 
I play out those 
bad scenarios 
in my head,” 
Harbaugh said. 
“(We were 
just) playing. 
Playing as fast 
as you can as 
hard as you can 
as long as you can. That’s what 
our guys did today and I’m very 
proud of them for doing that.”

Instead of coasting, Harbaugh 

accelerated. The coach protested 
the unsportsmanlike conduct 
penalty that “offended” him, 
elected to attempt a two-point 
conversion when up by 25, and 
waited as long as he possibly 
could to start running out the 
clock.

He also chewed out his 

team for only being up by 19 at 
halftime.

“He was livid in the locker 

room,” said redshirt freshman 
safety Jabrill Peppers. “He was 
angry because we weren’t really 
covering kicks at our best, and 
the defense wasn’t really playing 
how we should have been playing. 
He got after us a bit in the locker 
room, and we always try to find a 
way to respond the best way we 

can.”

Naturally, 

the Wolverines 
shut out 
Rutgers in the 
second half.

By now, fans 

and players 
alike have 
come to expect 
this from 
Harbaugh. 
He gets paid 

$5 million a year to win football 
games and, outside of close losses 
to No. 7 Michigan State and No. 
12 Utah, has done that. Michigan 
has outscored opponents by a 
238-56 margin in its seven wins.

More importantly, his 

players have taken after the 
coach’s unrelenting ways. The 
Wolverines, led by Harbaugh, 
did not take kindly to Rutgers 
celebrating a field goal that 
brought the Scarlet Knights 
within 19 to end the first half.

“(The Rutgers players) were 

just saying things like, ‘It’s our 

time, this second half. We the 
comeback kids. These guys can’t 
really finish games,’ ” Peppers 
said. “That just added the extra 
fuel to the fire.”

Added senior safety Jarrod 

Wilson: “I love it. Give the 
opponents no chance. Give them 
no hope.”

After Saturday’s win, Michigan 

enters the toughest three-game 
stretch of its season. Traveling 
to Indiana and Penn State before 
hosting No. 4 Ohio State, the 
Wolverines aren’t getting a late 
break as they continue to contend 
for a Big Ten title.

But thanks to a coach who 

doesn’t seem to know what a 
break is, they don’t want one 
anyway.

“He’s the ultimate competitor,” 

said junior tight end Jake Butt. 
“I think that’s pretty clear at this 
point; everybody knows that. I 
think down to the last tick on the 
clock, he’s going to be competing 
for everything. If it’s a call or if 
it’s a bad block, he’s going to be 
out there getting fired up and 
getting everyone around him 
fired up.”

It’s not your typical blowout, 

but it’s more fun this way.

BATTLE OF THE BEILEINS

LeVert’s onslaught 
helps Wolverines 
rout Le Moyne in 
exhibition game

By JACOB GASE

Daily Sports Editor

For a fleeting moment Friday 

night — after the Michigan men’s 
basketball 
team 
missed 
four 

straight 3-point attempts and Le 
Moyne’s 
Qwadere 
Lovell sank 
a free throw 
to give his team a one-point lead 
— it appeared Patrick Beilein’s 
squad might actually make a run 
at his father’s.

Unfortunately for the younger 

Beilein, that moment occurred in 
the first five minutes of the game, 
and it passed very quickly.

Sophomore 
guard 
Aubrey 

Dawkins spun across the lane 
for a flashy go-ahead layup 
and redshirt sophomore guard 
Duncan 
Robinson 
drilled 
a 

3-pointer for his first points in a 
Michigan uniform, igniting a 22-6 
run and ultimately leading John 
Beilein’s Wolverines to a 74-52 
exhibition victory over his oldest 
son’s Dolphins.

Senior guard Caris LeVert, 

playing in his first game since 
breaking his foot in January, 
showed exactly why his name 
generated NBA Draft buzz in the 
offseason. The preseason All-Big 
Ten star dazzled in his return to 
the court, exploding for 22 points 
on the strength of four 3-pointers, 
a highlight-reel dunk midway 
through the first half and 11 points 
in the first five and a half minutes 
of the second frame.

LeVert still came away slightly 

disappointed after missing a 
dunk in the second half — to his 
memory, the first dunk he’s ever 
missed in a game — but he was 
thrilled to be back on the floor for 
the first time in 10 months.

“I’ve been playing (in practice) 

for a few months, but I had some 
pre-game jitters,” LeVert said. “It 
felt great to be back out there.”

LeVert stole the show on the 

court, but most of the attention 
surrounding the game remained 
focused 
on 
the 
father-son 

coaching battle, with both teams 
running many of the same plays. 
Though Patrick couldn’t match 
the deep roster of the Division I 
recruits his father threw at him, 
the Wolverines’ slow offensive 
start — they made just three of 
their first 15 3-point attempts — 
and a few surges by the Dolphins 

kept the family affair somewhat 
competitive.

“That 3-for-15, we had like five 

(shots) wide, wide, wide open, 
but we didn’t get them,” the elder 
Beilein said, “but that’s gonna 
happen sometimes. That’s why 
it’s important we find other ways 
to score — throw the ball to the 
post, drive the ball better.”

Added Patrick Beilein: “We just 

relaxed a little bit. I told them in 
the huddle, ‘We’re running the 
same 
offense. 

How are they 
scoring 
and 

we 
aren’t?’ 

They 
were 

just 
cutting 

harder 
than 

us. We really 
took that and 
got 
defensive 

stops, 
got 

to 
run 
in 

transition 
a 

little bit. I’m really glad the way 
we responded.”

For Michigan, both Robinson 

and freshman forward Moritz 
Wagner made their team debuts 
in the rout, with slightly mixed 
results. Robinson put his highly 
touted scoring ability on display, 
tallying 15 points and knocking 
down three of six shots from his 
comfort zone: beyond the arc.

Wagner, who has been a work 

in progress early in his first season 
away from his native Germany, 
struggled initially and exited the 
first half with two fouls in under 
four 
minutes. 
The 
freshman 

settled down for a better second 
half, finishing the game with three 
rebounds and a late 3-pointer for 

his first collegiate basket.

In total, 12 Wolverines saw 

action Friday night. There were 
just three notable absences: junior 
forward Zak Irvin, who was ruled 
out Thursday as he continues to 
recover from back surgery, and a 
pair of junior walk-ons — guard 
Andrew Dakich and forward Sean 
Lonergan — who are exploring 
the possibility of redshirting this 
season.

After 
facing 
his 
father’s 

deep 
roster 

for 
the 
first 

(and 
possibly 

only) 
time, 

Patrick Beilein 
couldn’t 
help but find 
the 
moment 

surreal.

“I look down 

and I see him 
huddled 
with 

his 
assistant 

coaches, 
talking 
about 
how 

they’re going to stop us,” he said. 
“He was game-planning to stop 
Le Moyne, to stop myself and our 
coaching staff, and that was kind 
of funny.”

Apart from a few exchanged 

words 
in 
the 
pregame 
and 

postgame handshakes, though, 
John Beilein claimed he wasn’t 
distracted at all by his son’s 
presence.

“No moments like that. I was 

trying to get my team to play 
better,” John Beilein said. “That’s 
gonna be the issue for me forever. 
(My wife) Kathleen could’ve been 
on the other bench, and I (still) 
would’ve been trying to get my 
team to play better.”

Matchup between 

father and son 
a ‘win-win’ for 
Kathleen Beilein

By KELLY HALL

Daily Sports Writer

Friday night, Kathleen Beilein 

was part mom, part wife and part 
usher.

As her family poured into 

Crisler Center, she stood in the 
aisle of Section 134 and gave out 
hugs to more than 25 cousins, 
aunts and uncles, distributing 
white T-shirts emblazoned with 
“MichiMoyne” to Beileins from 
all over the country.

Though Kathleen has watched 

more than 30 of her husband’s 
home openers, this time was 
different. Friday, she watched her 
son, Patrick, take the role of head 
coach just a scorer’s table away 
from her husband, Michigan 
basketball coach John Beilein.

The exhibition between Le 

Moyne and the Wolverines was 
close for roughly five minutes 
before Michigan ran away to a 
74-52 victory.

Regardless of the outcome, the 

section clad in white cheered for 
both sides, remaining impartial 
throughout the game. After all, 
the Beileins have a lot to be happy 
about.

First-year 
Dolphins 
coach 

Patrick Beilein is filling the role 
his father played at Le Moyne in 
the 1980s and early 90s, allowing 
him to return to the place he grew 

up. The scenario is almost too 
good to be true, and cousins from 
Florida to New York came out for 
the game between Le Moyne’s 
past and present.

Though Kathleen, like the rest 

of her family, wanted there to be 
a way for both teams to win, she 
knew that win or lose, she had to 
find a way to get over her nerves 
because moments like these are 
far and few between.

“It was a win-win (for my 

mom),” Patrick said. “She was 
really good. She was maybe just 
as nervous as all of us, the whole 
family. It was a really interesting 
dynamic that we had never gone 
through before, and I’m just glad 
that it all played out well.”

According to Kathleen, the 

family has quite a few group chats, 
but the most active conversation 
is the one that involves her four 
children.

“We have a lot of group texts 

going on right now,” Kathleen 
said. “We have a lot of back-and-
forth, and it makes it a lot of fun. 
It goes all season long.

“But (right now), there hasn’t 

been anything 
other than a 
lot of pride for 
Patrick, 
and 

obviously 
a 

lot of pride for 
John. Just a lot 
of respect.”

Exactly 
30 

years separate John from Patrick, 
but the two have a lot in common. 
If you ask John’s sister, Peggy 
Sanders, she’ll say they have 
“identical” mannerisms, except 
Patrick is more “low-key,” like his 

mother, Kathleen.

“I think Patrick could be a 

combination (of us),” Kathleen 
Beilein said. “I see a younger 
version of John when I look over 
at the Le Moyne bench. It’s really 
touching. It touches me.”

At certain points on Friday 

night, both Beileins could be 
seen with their hands on their 
hips, 
inquisitively 
looking 
at 

their players. Senior guard Caris 
LeVert said playing Le Moyne felt 
similar to playing his teammates 
in practice because the Dolphins 
were running the same offense.

Patrick always wanted to run 

a similar offense to his father’s, 
but before he developed coaching 
aspirations, he just always wanted 
to play basketball. According to 
Patrick’s cousin, Rosie Nickles 
(who traveled from Florida for the 
game), Patrick has always loved 
basketball. Nickles remembers 
childhood afternoons filled with 
shooting hoops with him in their 
grandma’s backyard.

For the Beileins, basketball and 

family mesh together.

“That’s one thing that is first 

and 
foremost 

to us, and that’s 
the 
family 

concept,” 
Patrick Beilein 
said. “For all of 
those 
cousins 

and aunts and 
uncles to come 

in from all over the country, it’s 
nice to see. It kinda sets you back 
to see how much it means to them 
and how much they are invested 
in our family.”

After the game concluded, 

John and Patrick lingered a little 
longer than normal at halfcourt. 
John was unsure if he should 
give his son a hug or a handshake 
and ended up doing something in 
between instead.

There was plenty of time to 

give hugs after the game in the 
Crisler Club, where his sizeable 
family congregated post-game.

Kathleen 
stood 
out 
from 

the crowd, donning a different 
handmade shirt of her own. Last 
weekend, when Patrick visited his 
parents, he brought a Le Moyne 
T-shirt with him at his mother’s 
request, but had no idea what she 
planned on doing with it.

The 
end 
product 
spelled 

out “Michigan” on top, with a 
sewn-on Le Moyne logo directly 
beneath it.

“I’m not sure if she sewed it 

herself, but she might have, so 
that’s pretty neat,” Patrick Beilein 
said. “She’s making a statement, I 
guess.

“She can do that. She’s Mrs. 

Beilein.”

(for my mom).”

Wolverines dominate exhibition

By CHRIS CROWDER 

Daily Sports Writer

With 2:48 left in the first 

quarter of Saturday’s exhibition 
game, 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball 
coach Kim 
Barnes 
Arico called 
a timeout. Her team led, 21-13, but 
it was giving Ferris State too many 
scoring opportunities for her 
liking. After allowing the Bulldogs 
to score easily in the post early 
on, the Wolverines regrouped on 
defense after the timeout, forcing 
three straight turnovers.

Michigan 
implemented 
a 

three-quarter court press soon 
after, giving the Bulldogs little 
room to dribble or even find a 
clear passing lane. Ferris State 
couldn’t find any rhythm on 
offense, struggling to earn open 
shots. It ended the quarter with a 
shot-clock violation.

The Bulldogs didn’t score again 

until there were nearly eight 
minutes left in the second quarter, 
and the Wolverines used their 
size advantage and hustle to coast 
past Ferris State, 109-39, in the 
exhibition.

“We really pressured the ball,” 

Barnes Arico said. “I thought 
we gave great help and we made 
them feel uncomfortable, forcing 
turnovers. And forcing those 
turnovers led to easy baskets for 
us in transition.”

Meanwhile, 
Michigan 

maintained an up-tempo offense 
in transition, using its skilled 
shooters to spread the floor. The 
Wolverines converted their first 

three 3-point attempts, two of 
which came from sophomore 
guard Katelynn Flaherty.

During 
that 
half-quarter 

stretch, Michigan more than 
doubled its point total. The 
defense alternated from man to 
zone and tallied 22 points off of 
15 Bulldog turnovers. Flaherty 
shot 4-for-5 from behind the arc 
and led all scorers with 16 points. 
Freshman guard Nicole Munger 
added 13 points off the bench, 
finding open lanes to the basket 
for her teammates to easily feed 
her the ball on the run.

Michigan racked up 11 steals 

in the first half, and though the 
Wolverines led handily, they 
showed no mercy on defense to 
start the second half.

“At halftime, Coach came in 

and set the ground, like, ‘We 
need to pick it up (on defense),’ 
” said freshman center Hallie 
Thome. “We went out there with a 
different mindset, and if we work 
together and talk, things will tend 
to go our way.”

Michigan began the second 

half by feeding the ball to the 
6-foot-5 Thome, who scored the 
first 10 points of the half before 
Flaherty hit another 3-pointer. 
She added another steal on the 
next possession, leading to a wide-
open layup that added another 
pair to her team-high 28 points.

“(Assistant 
coach 
Megan 

Duffy) told me to not go away from 
what I’m great at and just shoot 
it,” Flaherty said. “Throughout 
the practices this week, if I gave 
up an open shot, my teammates 
told me that I need to shoot that, 
so I think that’s what helped me.”

Freshman 
guard 
Boogie 

Brozoski displayed flashes of her 
relentless defensive style as well, 
keeping the Ferris State guards 
honest when protecting the ball 
and diving on the hardwood for 
loose balls. Munger intercepted 
passes in the lane, proving the 
freshmen are talented defenders, 
along with the upperclassmen.

The Wolverines passed the 

century mark in scoring with five 
minutes left in the final quarter, 
putting them at 101 points. At that 
point, the Bulldogs had been in 
a scoring drought for over four 
minutes and had scored just 35 
total points. Michigan shot 67 

percent from the field, including 
the same percentage from behind 
the arc.

Sunday’s contest will not go in 

the win column because it was 
an exhibition, but the Wolverines 
didn’t lack any effort on the 
floor. Their opponent was not 
on par with the talent Michigan 
will be facing all season, but 
the Wolverines hustled without 
the ball and showed a prolific 
shooting ability. Despite the slow 
start, Michigan displayed little 
of the sloppiness that typically 
comes with early-season games.

It took them just one timeout to 

regroup.

Michigan falls in 
Big Ten semifinal

By BILLY STAMPFL

For the Daily

The sense of disappointment 

could not be ignored Friday night 
after 
the 

Michigan 
women’s 
soccer team fell to No. 9 Penn 
State in a closely contested Big 
Ten Tournament semifinal.

After 61 minutes of scoreless 

action, Nittany Lions forward 
Frannie Crouse bent a shot from 
the edge of the penalty box that 
sailed over sophomore goalkeeper 
Megan Hinz’s head and into the 
back of the net. Crouse’s goal 
proved to be the deciding factor 
in Penn State’s 1-0 win.

“I just fell a couple inches short 

(of stopping the shot),” Hinz said. 
“Penn State is a very strong team, 
and that was a great strike.”

Though disappointed with the 

result of such a high-stakes game, 
Michigan (7-4-2 Big Ten, 12-7-2 
overall) showed improvement 
from its match with the Nittany 
Lions a week ago. In their 
regular-season finale in State 
College, the Wolverines fell, 3-1, 
and were dominated for nearly 
the entire tilt.

“Today was a much more level 

game,” said Michigan coach Greg 
Ryan. “We knew it would be a 
tough game, and I’m really proud 
of our effort.”

After trailing in shots in the 

first half, 8-2, the Wolverines 

rebounded and outshot Penn 
State (11-2-1, 15-3-2) 10-5 in the 
second half. Strikes by redshirt 
sophomore Ani Sarkisian in the 
73rd and 75th minutes came close 
to tying the game for Michigan, 
but both narrowly missed the 
goal.

“We got some good chances 

and some good shots,” Ryan 
said. “But it was just one of those 
things where theirs went in and 
ours didn’t.”

In addition to the second-

half offensive awakening, the 
Wolverines can look to Hinz’s 
efforts as a positive moving 
forward. 
The 
sophomore 

goalkeeper has started 18 of 20 
games this year, boasting a 1.06 
goals-against average and six 
shutouts, most notably against 
Northwestern in the Ben Ten 
Tournament quarterfinals.

“She is making some plays to 

keep us in games,” Ryan said. 
“And that’s all you can ask of your 
goalkeeper.”

Despite 
being 
eliminated 

from the Big Ten Tournament, 
Michigan still has a glimmer of 
hope in the form of the NCAA 
Tournament. 
The 
Wolverines 

will wait for Monday afternoon’s 
selection show to see if they 
receive an at-large bid.

“I think there’s a very good shot 

we make it in,” Ryan said. “But we 
know there are no guarantees, so 
right now we’re just sitting and 
waiting on Monday.”

Five Things We Learned

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

Behind a career performance 

from 
fifth-year 
senior 

quarterback Jake Rudock, the 
Michigan football team improved 
to 7-2 on the season with a 49-16 
win over Rutgers on Saturday. 

Redshirt 
freshman 
Jabrill 

Peppers 
scored 
his 
second 

rushing touchdown of the season 
in the win, continuing his ever-
expanding role in the offense. But 
even aside from that, there were 
plenty of new developments on 
display.

Here are five things we learned 

from the game.

1. Jabrill Peppers still finds 
ways to impress Jim Harbaugh.

At this point, there’s not 

much Peppers could do on 
the football field that would 
surprise anyone, least of all 
his coach. But in the second 
quarter, when Peppers turned 
a bubble screen into an 18-yard 
touchdown, even Harbaugh was 
impressed.

“I knew he was good, but he’s 

really good,” Harbaugh said. “I 
thought there was not another 
rung to go on the ladder, but 
there is. He found another rung 
to go even higher.”

Peppers first dodged a would-

be tackler in the backfield, 
then weaved his way into the 
end zone, high stepping as he 
crossed the plane. When his 
coach called him over after the 
play, Peppers was concerned 
he would be chastised for 
showboating. 
Instead, 
he 

received praise.

“I thought he was about to 

yell at me for my celebrating,” 
Peppers said. “But he just 
stopped me and he was like, 
‘Man, I knew you were good, 
but you’re really good.’ 

“We just shared a laugh with 

each other. It was a special 
moment.”

2. Deception is prohibited.

The 
most 
head-scratching 

moment of the game came late 
in the second quarter, when 
Michigan appeared to pick up a 
huge gain on a pass to junior tight 
end Jake Butt, who was wide 
open on the right sideline and 
took Rudock’s pass 51 yards.

But to Michigan’s dismay, the 

play was called back due to a 
penalty for “intent to deceive.”

And as it turns out, there is a rule 

prohibiting using the substitution 
process to deceive opponents.

Butt left the huddle around the 

same time as several teammates 
who ran off the field. And while 
Butt was distinctly behind those 
teammates, the point is that the 
defense could have reasonably 
assumed he was exiting the field. 
Hence the penalty for deception.

The notion that deception is 

illegal seems a little silly in a 
sport where play-action fakes are 
a cornerstone of most offenses 
and trick plays are praised. But 
there is a rule against what Butt 
did, and it appears to have been 
applied correctly. Who knew?

3. Jourdan Lewis can return 
kicks, too.

Peppers 
isn’t 
the 
only 

Michigan defensive back who 
can make an impact with the ball 
in his hands on special teams.

With 
Peppers 
banged 
up 

following a practice collision 
with redshirt junior cornerback 
Jeremy Clark, and with Harbaugh 
trying to limit Peppers’ workload 
anyway, 
junior 
cornerback 

Jourdan Lewis got to try his hand 
at returning kickoffs. And the 
results were impressive.

On two kickoff returns, Lewis 

totaled 59 yards, including a 
long of 35. He flashed impressive 
speed and good instincts going 
toward the sideline if lanes in the 
middle closed.

Maybe Michigan should just 

let its defensive backs play every 

position.

4. Big guests gather at the Big 
House

Rapper Big Sean was in his 

native Detroit for his concert 
over 
the 
weekend, 
and 
he 

stopped by Michigan Stadium to 
watch the game and speak with 
the team following the game. Big 
Sean attended Cass Technical 
High 
School, 
where 
several 

Wolverines, including Lewis and 
linebacker Royce Jenkins-Stone 
also attended. Some players took 
pictures with the rapper, who 
even helped Harbaugh break the 
postgame huddle.

5. Bold Prediction: Michigan 
will play for the Big Ten 
Championship.

Bear with me here. Nebraska’s 

controversial win over Michigan 
State on Saturday night opened 
the door for this, and actually it’s 
not as outlandish as it seems.

The most likely path to 

this 
unlikely 
outcome 
is 

Michigan winning out, which 
includes beating Ohio State. 
The Buckeyes are the superior 
team on paper, but they still 
haven’t played to their sky-high 
potential, and they have yet to 
play against a team as physical 
as Michigan. To make matters 
worse, they’ll be taking on the 
Wolverines after what should be 
a tough game against Michigan 
State in Columbus.

And given the way Michigan’s 

last rivalry game ended, expect 
Harbaugh to have the team at its

FOOTBALL
The good, bad and 
ugly from Saturday

By JAKE LOURIM

The Michigan football team 

left no doubt Saturday. After 
stealing a win in their last game 
and having one stolen from 
them in the game before, the 
Wolverines 
pounded 
Rutgers, 

49-16, returning to the form they 
showed earlier in the season.

Michigan was most efficient on 

offense, in both the running and 
passing games, but the defense 
showed bright spots, too. A few 
mistakes 
weren’t 
enough 
to 

make Saturday’s game close, as 
the Wolverines (4-1 Big Ten, 7-2 
overall) made the Scarlet Knights’ 
(1-5, 3-6) first trip to Michigan 
Stadium a rough one.

The 
Daily 
breaks 
down 

the good, bad and ugly from 
Saturday’s game:

The good

Fifth-year senior quarterback 

Jake Rudock turned in a career 
day after leaving last week’s 
game at Minnesota with an 
injury. Rudock went 18-for-25 for 
337 yards and two touchdowns 
against Rutgers. The Wolverines 
also 
took 
steps 
toward 

establishing their deep passing 
game, completing seven passes of 
20 or more yards. Junior tight end 
Jake Butt caught four passes for 
102 yards, more than he had in the 
previous three games combined 
and the most by a Michigan player 
this season.

Junior running back De’Veon 

Smith got back on track, carrying 
15 times for 73 yards and showing 
no ill effects after limping off 
against Minnesota last week. And 
redshirt freshman Jabrill Peppers 
remained an offensive weapon 
with an 18-yard touchdown run 
in the second quarter.

Michigan’s offense wore down 

the Scarlet Knights early on by 
possessing the ball for 19:04 in 

the first half, and the comfortable 
lead allowed several reserves 
to come in. Redshirt freshman 
quarterback Wilton Speight and 
redshirt 
sophomore 
running 

backs Wyatt Shallman and Ross 
Taylor-Douglas 
each 
earned 

touches.

Defensively, junior cornerback 

Jourdan Lewis broke up two 
passes to set a school record with 
19 on the season.

The bad

While 
the 
defense’s 

performance was strong as usual, 
Michigan still had some lapses 
that it did not show earlier in 
the season. In the first-quarter, 
a 54-yard scamper by Rutgers 
running back Robert Martin set 
up the Scarlet Knights’ first field 
goal. In the second, face-mask 
and holding penalties put Rutgers 
in position for another field goal.

Also in the first half, redshirt 

junior defensive lineman Ryan 
Glasgow injured his shoulder. 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
said after the game he was 
hopeful it was a minor injury.

The ugly

There wasn’t much to report 

in the ugly department, but a 
couple of special-teams miscues 
stood out. Rutgers wide receiver 
Janarion Grant returned a kickoff 
98 yards for a touchdown with 
10:29 left in the second quarter, 
trimming Michigan’s lead to 
21-10.

Then, near the end of the first 

half, Grant ran back a punt 67 
yards to the Wolverines’ nine-
yard line with nine seconds left, 
setting up a field goal as the half 
expired.

Of course, neither proved to 

be significant, but special teams 
coordinator John Baxter surely 
will make the two plays a point of 
emphasis this week.

‘M’ falls short in title game

Wolverines rally for 
double-OT win in 
semifinals, fall to 
Maryland in final

By LELAND MITCHINSON

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan field hockey 

team snatched a victory from 
the jaws of defeat Friday, beating 
Penn State in overtime, 2-1.

But on Sunday, the Wolverines’ 

luck ran out as they fell, 5-1, to 
No. 7 Maryland in the Big Ten 
Tournament championship.

Maryland, 
coming 
off 
its 

own 
double-overtime 
victory 

over Northwestern, started fast 
Sunday on its way to a 5-1 victory. 
Forward Wilma Luus opened the 
scoring just over two minutes into 
the game for the Terrapins.

The 
Wolverines 
responded 

with 
three 
straight 
penalty 

corners but were unable to 
convert any of them. Though 
Michigan created good pressure, 
Maryland added another goal to 
its lead with 18:16 left in the half 
on a counterattack.

Michigan got on the board 

when 
redshirt 
sophomore 

forward Allie Sardo controlled a 
loose ball in the Maryland circle 
and scored with 6:13 left until 
halftime.

“I think we knew it was going to 

be a game with its ups and downs 
and we had to play 70 minutes,” 
Scavelli said. “They got on the 
scoreboard first, but we’ve had 
games where that has happened 
in the past. We know you have to 
play to the last whistle, so we just 
tried to keep that in our mind and 
keep playing.”

In 
the 
second 
half, 
the 

Terrapins dominated possession. 
As the Wolverines had to take 
more chances as time wound 
down, Maryland was able to 
take advantage of those risks. 
Michigan ran out of luck after a 
thrilling win to advance Friday

In that game, Michigan had 

the advantage in both shots and 
penalty corners in the first half 
but went to the locker room in a 
scoreless tie.

“I think we were just pressing 

a little bit,” said Michigan coach 
Marcia Pankratz. “We were a 
little bit overanxious in the circle, 
but we were dominating and not 
getting a lot of chances. I think as 
you go longer and longer without 
scoring, you get a little bit more 
tense.”

Just three and a half minutes 

into the second half, a Penn State 
player went down inside the 
Wolverines’ circle. The following 
corner 
opportunity 
gave 
the 

Nittany Lions their best chance 
of the game. 
The initial shot 
was saved by 
sophomore 
goalie 
Sam 

Swenson, 
but 

Penn 
State 

forward 
Kirsten 
Gochnauer 
pounced on the 
rebound 
and 

slotted it into 
the net for the game’s opening 
goal.

Michigan was unable to find an 

answer, and Swenson came out 
of her net as time wound down 
to make a save. A Penn State 
player knocked off Swenson’s 
helmet, and Swenson responded 
by lashing out at the legs of the 
culprit. Nittany Lion forward 
Aurelia Meijer retaliated, took a 

red card and was ejected from the 
game.

With 1:16 left in the game, 

Swenson went off for freshman 
midfielder Leah Cardarelli so the 
Wolverines could have an extra 
attacker.

Twenty seconds later, senior 

forward Shannon Scavelli’s shot 
rebounded off the Penn State 
goaltender, and Cardarelli tapped 
the ball into the net to send the 
game to overtime.

“I think we were having a hard 

time getting the ball through 

(the defense),” 
Cardarelli said. 
“Penn State did 
a really good 
job 
marking 

the lanes and 
open 
passes, 

so I think once 
we were able 
to manipulate 
that and work 
together it kind 
of all clicked.”

With 
a 
player 
advantage 

due to the earlier red card, the 
Wolverines controlled the tempo 
in the extra period. With 12:27 
remaining in the first extra 
frame, 
sophomore 
midfielder 

Katie Trombetta scored on a give-
and-go from freshman forward 
Emma Way, winning the game for 
Michigan.

“I mean, this could have been 

the end of our season,” Trombetta 
said. “Being able to go out and 
give it your all, and then it ended 
up working out in our favor and 
getting that goal in the last minute 
really was unbelievable.”

But 
the 
Wolverines’ 
late 

victory was bittersweet. The Big 
Ten suspended Swenson just 
before Sunday’s championship 
game against Maryland due to 
her actions in Friday’s game 
that resulted in the Penn State 
red card. Pankratz called on 
redshirt junior Chris Lueb to start 
Saturday’s bout — her 16th career 
appearance.

Michigan 
faced 
further 

absences during the game. With 
5:46 left in the game, senior 
defender Lauren Thomas suffered 
a blow to the head while lunging 
for the ball. During her steal 
attempt, a Maryland attacker 
accidentally hit Thomas with her 
stick and foot, causing Thomas to 
be helped off field by the trainers. 
Fifth-year 
senior 
defender 

Mackenzie Ellis also took a shot 
to the hand, though both will be 
ready to go next week, according 
to Pankratz.

“We had to take a lot more 

risks, and that just opened us up 
to be a little bit more vulnerable 
as well,” Pankratz said. “Bottom 
line, we didn’t have a very good 
game today, and they beat us fair 
and square.”

we didn’t have 

a very good 
game today.”
