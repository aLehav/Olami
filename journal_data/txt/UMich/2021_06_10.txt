Matt Schembechler, the son of 

former Michigan football coach 
Bo Schembechler, will be speaking 
at a press conference on Thursday 
afternoon about “his own abuse 
by Dr. Anderson and his father’s 
failure to protect him and other 
athletes,” per a release from the 
Anderson Survivors Legal Team.

Last month, the University of 

Michigan released a report from 
legal firm WilmerHale regarding 
the investigation into allegations 
of decades of abuse by former 
Michigan doctor Robert Anderson. 
The report also found allegations 
that Schembechler failed to take 
action when alerted of abuse by 
multiple athletes. 

The 
report 
also 
implicated 

former 
athletic 
director 
Don 

Canham, 
another 
towering 

figure in U-M sports history and 
Schmbechler’s 
contemporary, 

for allegedly having been alerted 
to Anderson’s abuses. Anderson 
worked at the University from the 
1960s until 2003. 

Matt Schembechler sued his 

father, the University of Michigan, 
and campus police in Jan. 1999 
over a scheme to sell old seats from 
Michigan Stadium as souvenirs. 
The lawsuit was eventually thrown 
out in federal court.

Schembechler will be joined by 

former Wolverine football players 
Daniel Kwiatkowski (1977-1979) 
and Gilvanni Johnson (1982-1986), 
who allege abuse by Anderson as 
well. Kwiatkowski and Johnson 
are two of the anonymous student-
athlete sources in the WilmerHale 
report.

One former student athlete in the 

report questioned Schembechler 
about Dr. Anderson’s methods but 
according to the student athlete, 
Schembechler told him to “toughen 
up.” The student athlete told the 
UM Department of Public Safety 
and Security (DPSS) that “you do 
not mess with Bo, and the matter 
was dropped.” 

Another former student athlete 

told DPSS that, “his position coach 
used the threat of an examination 
with Dr. Anderson as a motivational 
tool. (WilmerHale) interviewed the 
coach, who denied the allegation.”

The failure of the Athletic 

Department to protect students 
from abuse by those in authority 
goes beyond the football team. A 
former track athlete alleged that 
former coaches Jack Harvey and 
Ron Warhurst both “‘laughed’ and 
refused” when the student asked 
to see another physician after 
Anderson “(groped) his genitals.” 
Both Harvey and Warhurst deny 
the allegation.

At the end of the report’s 

section 
entitled 
“Instances 
of 

Potential Awareness in the Athletic 
Department,” 
WilmerHale 

concluded that there was a pattern 
of misconduct by Anderson that 
was perpetuated for decades.

Most damning, however, was 

WilmerHale’s observation of the 
Athletic Department as a whole in 
light of the misconduct allegations: 
“no Athletic Department personnel 
took any action, initiated any 
inquiry, or referred Dr. Anderson 
for investigation….the fact that 
no one took meaningful action is 
particularly disturbing in light of 
the nature, scope, and duration of 
Dr. Anderson’s misconduct.” 

Last week, current football head 

coach Jim Harbaugh, who played 
for 
Schembechler 
from 
1983-

1986, said that he didn’t believe 
Schembechler would have sat on 
information regarding Anderson. 

“Well, I can tell you this,” 

Harbaugh said. “Bo Schembechler 
— there was nothing that I saw 
during the times I was a kid here, 
my dad was on the staff, or when 
I played here — he never sat on 
anything. He never procrastinated 
anything. I mean, he took care 
of it before the sun went down. 
That’s the Bo Schembechler that 
I know.

“Nothing was ever swept under 

the rug or ignored. He addressed 
everything in a timely fashion. 
That’s the Bo Schembechler that 
I know.”

The University of Michigan’s 

LSA Student Government (LSA 
SG) met virtually in a special 
meeting on Wednesday night 
to debate and pass a proposed 
resolution condemning violence 
against the Palestinian people 
and what some members believed 
to be a system of apartheid in 
Israel.

The 
resolution, 
coded 
as 

R F2021.06, says that it is 
LSA 
SG’s 
responsibility 
to 

represent Palestinian students 
on campus and to help the 
student population become more 
educated on the oppression of 
Palestinians.

“LSA SG urges other members 

of 
the 
U-M 
community 
to 

collectively work together to 
educate 
themselves 
on 
the 

issue of the persecution of 
the Palestinian people, uplift 
Palestinian voices on campus, 
and protect community members 
who use their first amendment 
rights to criticize the Israeli 
government in a legitimate way,” 
the resolution reads.

The 
special 
meeting 
was 

called after the resolution was 
discussed and then tabled at a 
May 26 regular meeting. The 
motion to table the resolution 
until 
Wednesday 
narrowly 

passed 11-10 with 3 abstaining. 
At the same May 26 meeting, 
LSA SG unanimously passed 
a separate resolution, coded 
R F2020.05, condemning the 
recent rise in antisemitism. 

“LSA SG stands in solidarity 

with all Jewish members of our 
community during this period of 
increased hate,” the resolution 
reads. “In the pursuit of anti-
racism, LSA SG commits itself 
to actively addressing any and 
all instances of antisemitism on 
campus and will seek to partner 
with relevant student groups 
such as Michigan Hillel to 
identify such instances.”

The 
University 
of 

Michigan’s 
Central 
Student 

Government 
(CSG) 
gathered 

on Tuesday to vote on various 
resolutions pertaining to tri-
campus equality, scholarship 
distribution to U-M personal 
care assistants and a student 
health and wellness task force, 
as well as to confirm CSG 
cabinet positions. 

The Assembly discussed and 

passed a proposal, LDF 11-002, 
requesting $10,000 from the 
CSG budget to fund a rally for 
tri-campus 
equity. 
Funding 

for the rally includes up to 10 
ADA-complaint and disability-
conscious 
buses 
to 
provide 

transportation from U-M Flint 
and Dearborn campuses to Ann 
Arbor for the protest, supplies 
for 
staging 
and 
victuals. 

The 
proposal 
was 
passed 

unanimously. 

LSA 
senior 
Joseph 

Lobodzinski debated in favor 
of the motion, referencing an 
article by The Michigan Daily 
regarding University President 
Mark Schlissel asking U-M 
faculty if they believe the 
University should use funds to 
expand the Go Blue Guarantee 
to the Dearborn and Flint 
campuses, even if it meant 
sacrificing ‘academic excellence 
and salary growth’ at the Ann 
Arbor campus. 

“(The 
question) 
pits 
us 

against our fellow students at 
the University of Michigan-
Flint and Dearborn. They are 
using the classic divide and 
conquer tactic,” Lobodzinski 
said. 
“This 
motion 
will 

organize about 400 students 
from both the Dearborn and 
Flint campuses to come to the 
University of Michigan (Ann 
Arbor) campus and advocate on 
their behalf for more funding to 
their campuses.” 

CSG 
also 
discussed 
two 

resolutions pertaining to the 
creation of a Student Health 
and Wellness task force and 
the 
authorization 
of 
the 

creation of an initial funding 
for a task force charged with 
producing, vetting, and gifting 

scholarships to employed as 
personal care assistants at the 
University. 
Both 
resolutions 

passed unanimously. 

Tensions 
initially 
arose 

between 
the 
executive 

nomination 
committee 
and 

CSG President Nithya Arun 
after the committee released 
a report of disapproval for 
LSA 
junior 
Grace 
Roberts’ 

confirmation as Chief of Staff 
following their interview with 
Roberts. CSG member Noah 
Zimmerman was present at the 
executive nomination hearing 
with Roberts and reiterated 
the 
committee’s 
disapproval 

for Roberts for the position 
of Chief of Staff. Zimmerman 
said 
Roberts’ 
relationship 

with Arun, as well as her 
contradictory approach, pushed 
the committee to express their 
disapproval. 

“Grace made it very aware 

that she wanted to take a unique 
perspective on (the role of 
Chief of Staff) and that (Arun 
and Robert’s) had a working 
relationship, but only a working 
relationship of the recent past,” 
Zimmerman said. “She thought 
that was a beneficial quality 
to have, and we disagreed on 
that. We do think it is a good 
idea to have someone who 
disagrees and someone that 
is not just a yes man … but, 
however, she (said she) would 
go with what she wanted. Those 
two concerns … gave us no 
confidence to give her a positive 
recommendation.”

When 
asked 
about 
her 

contradictory 
approach, 

Roberts said that she would not 
simply follow along with the 
President and Vice President’s 
agendas as a rubber stamper.

“What 
was 
communicated 

in the executive nominations 
report 
is 
not 
an 
accurate 

representation of what I said or 
what I believe,” Roberts said. 
“I am a voice that (President) 
Nithya and (Vice President) 
Carla trust, and I want to be 
able to say to them my honest 
opinion about things, but that 
doesn’t mean I am bull-headed 
and that I will not do the things 
expected of me as Chief of 
Staff.”

With 
increased 
vaccination 

rates, 
relaxed 
COVID-19 

restrictions 
and 
increased 

government stimulus, businesses 
are looking to return to pre-
pandemic levels of production. 
There’s just one small problem: 
some businesses can’t seem to find 
employees.

Jack 
Edelstein, 
owner 
of 

Apothecare Ann Arbor, an organic 
cannabis 
cultivation 
facility, 

said that overall his business has 
run pretty smoothly during the 
pandemic but found that COVID-
19 made it difficult to secure a 
steady staff.

“We’ve been in business for 

under two years, so we’re still in 
that startup phase, and there’s 
always challenges,” Edelstein said. 
“The most challenging one has 
been assembling a stable team of 
employees … and I guess COVID 
did play a role here, because it made 
some potential employees just 
unavailable for various reasons.”

As more businesses began to 

lessen their restrictions in April, 
U.S. employment in leisure and 
hospitality 
had 
increased 
by 

331,000, half of which consisted of 
jobs relating to food service.

Incoming LSA freshman Sarah 

Ashby who currently works in food 
service 
experiences 
significant 

understaffing at her workplace. 
Ashby said she noticed a lack of 
productivity and staff morale as a 
result.

“(Employees) aren’t the nicest 

but you can’t fire them (because 
of short staff),” Ashby said. “I 
know it gets stressful – they work 
long hours (so) they just have bad 

attitudes.”

Ashby said that people may also 

be hesitant to get jobs right now 
because of potential exposure to 
COVID-19. 

“There’s just a lot of uncertainty 

right now and some people aren’t 
sure if they want to work right 
now,” Ashby said. 

Rising LSA sophomore Sara 

Ojala, who also currently works 
in food service, said she felt that 
the national staff shortage was 
the result of a mixture of a few 
different factors. As a student who 
has experienced Zoom fatigue this 
year, Ojala said that it’s not very 
motivating right now for someone 
to get a full-time job in the summer. 

“I think that a lot of people have 

gotten very comfortable during the 
past year and a half doing things 
from home,” Ojala said. “(People) 
are more accustomed to staying 
home in their own bubble as 
opposed to putting themselves out 
there again.” 

Ojala said another reason could 

be that staff shortages can create 
an immediate stressor for new 
employees.

“I actually think that, ironically, 

it is a deterrent that businesses 
are short-staffed,” Ojala said. “ I 
know that if I were a prospective 
employee, I would be pretty 
hesitant to jump into a job that is 
stressful on others and would be 
stressful on me.” 

Business 
professor 
Jeffrey 

Sanchez-Burks said people have 
had a year-long reflection on 
the employment conditions that 
existed since before the pandemic. 
He said wage level plays a partial 
role in the staff shortage, which 
is why some organizations began 
increasing wages.

between the executive nomination

Nithya Arun after the committee 
released a report of disapproval 
for LSA junior Grace Roberts’

following their interview with 
Roberts. 
CSG

Noah

Many members of CSG raised 

their hands to defend Roberts 
against 
the 
claims 
made 
by 

the 
committee. 
CSG 
member 

Zaynab Elkolaly jumped in on the 
discussion to defend the integrity 

of the nomination itself, stating that 
in the past, a person’s character 
was never as important as their 
experience and judgment. 

“I am also confused by the fact 

that her character was particularly 

highlighted to begin with,” Elkolaly 
said. “I know that historically 
in 
nominations 
we 
focus 
on 

experience and things that relate 
directly to the position.”

Members unanimously voted 

to confirm Roberts as the Chief of 
Staff for the CSG executive branch. 

Following many requests from 

the 
campus 
community, 
the 

President’s Advisory Committee 
on University History released 
a preliminary report on April 27 
recommending the removal of 
Fielding H. Yost’s name from the 
Yost Ice Arena. 

Yost played football during 

his time as a student at West 
Virginia University and went 
on to serve as the head football 
coach at six different universities, 
bringing him to the University 
of 
Michigan. 
Yost 
was 
the 

University’s head football coach 
from 1901-23 and again from 
1925-26, and he served as the 
University’s athletic director from 
1921-41. Yost was known for his 
“point-a-minute” teams and led 
the Michigan football team to six 

national championships and ten 
Big 10 conference titles. In 1923, 
the University named the Field 
House after Yost, and in 1973, it 
was remodeled into the Yost Ice 
Arena. 

The 
President’s 
Advisory 

Committee’s 
recent 
report 

asserts that Fielding H. Yost’s 
contributions to U-M athletics 
have historically been emphasized 
while the “profoundly deep and 
negative impact he had on people 
of color” has not been equally 
acknowledged.

“Some who read this report will 

wonder if we are ‘blaming’ Yost for 
simply being a ‘man of his time,’” 
the report reads. “We reject 
this view because our historical 
analysis reveals that Yost — and 
others at the University in his 
day — had choices to make and 
evidence from their own times 
indicating the right ones.”

The 
committee 
specifically 

cites Yost’s involvement in an 

infamous incident in 1934 — while 
he served as Athletic Director — 
when the U-M football team chose 
to bench Willis Ward, the 1933 Big 
Ten Athlete of the Year and only 
the second Black U-M football 
player , in a game against Georgia 
Tech. Georgia Tech refused to 
play against the University’s team 
in Michigan Stadium if a Black 
player was allowed to play, so 
Yost decided to keep Ward from 
playing and met Georgia Tech on 
the field with an all-white team.

In 
the 
Historical 
Analysis 

section 
of 
the 
report, 
the 

committee said Yost scheduled 
the 
game 
against 
Georgia 

Tech despite being well aware 
of the traditional racist rules 
that Georgia would expect the 
University to adhere to. The 
report also suggested that Yost 
was responsible for maintaining 
a “color line” in U-M athletic 
programs during his career at 
Michigan. It noted that Ward was 

the only African American athlete 
to receive a varsity football letter 
during Yost’s 40-year tenure as 
head football coach and athletic 
director.

University spokesperson Kim 

Broekhuizen wrote in an email 
to The Michigan Daily that the 
committee’s report was issued and 
made available for public comment 
after a year of investigating how 
the Ward incident and the rest 
of Yost’s career has impacted the 
campus community.

“In 2020, multiple requests 

to remove the honorific name 
of Fielding H. Yost from the ice 
arena were received and referred 
to 
the 
President’s 
Advisory 

Committee on University History 
for review,” Broekhuizen wrote. 
“The 
committee’s 
preliminary 

recommendation 
comes 
after 

a year of study by the panel of 
university historians.”

The 
committee 
invited 

members 
of 
the 
University 

community 
to 
provide 

feedback on their preliminary 
recommendation by June 7 using 
an online portal which requires a 
U-M email address.

The feedback the committee 

receives will be shared with 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel, who will then be able to 
use it to accept, reject or modify 
the 
original 
recommendation. 

However, ultimately, any final 
decisions 
regarding 
whether 

or 
not 
to 
implement 
the 

recommendation must be made 
by the Board of Regents. A source 
close to the board said the name is 
unlikely to ultimately change.

LSA 
sophomore 
Alexander 

Nguyen 
said 
he 
thinks 
the 

recommendation 
to 
remove 

Yost’s name shows a “positive 
improvement” in the University’s 
commitment to Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion (DEI).

lingo such as LOL, the visual aspect 
that sets emojis apart from script is 
part of their popularity. Emojis allow 
for emotion and other cues used 
during face-to-face interaction to be 
imbued into text-based conversation. 
With the focus on pictures in emojis, 
there have been claims they are the 
modern incarnation of Egyptian 
hieroglyphics. A current exhibit 
in the Israel Museum entitled 
“Emoglyphs” attempts to display 
a link between hieroglyphics and 
emojis. However, emojis are not 
exact recreations of hieroglyphics 
for the modern world. “Emoglyphs” 
is an example of how some 
people are connecting the two 
communication 
systems, 
but 

emojis and Egyptian hieroglyphics 
may not have the straightforward 
connection that the exhibit and 
others argue to exist. Taking 
cultural variation in emoji usage 
into 
account, 
the 
relationship 

between the ancient and modern 
pictographic 
systems 
becomes 

murky.

Egyptian hieroglyphics emerged 

approximately 5,000 years ago 
and became the dominant written 
language in ancient Egypt. More 
than 700 hieroglyphs were in 
usage, some representing sounds 
and other purely grammatical 
functions. These symbols were 
inscribed on temple walls and used 
as decoration for objects utilized 
in daily life. But hieroglyphics did 
not forever stand alone as the only 
writing system used by the ancient 
Egyptians. Other scripts — Demotic, 

Coptic and Ancient Greek — were 
common near the end of ancient 
Egyptian civilization. The last 
known hieroglyphic inscription is 
dated to the 5th century C.E. when 
the writing system fell out of use. 
The thousands of years of Egyptian 
writing are not a story of just 
hieroglyphs but a myriad of scripts 
that 
facilitated 
communication 

throughout the civilization.

The history of emojis is not 

measured in millennia but in 
decades. Emerging from Japan, the 
first emojis were put into use during 
the late 1990s and they became 
immensely popular among the 
Japanese. This led to an increased 
interest 
from 
international 

communication 
companies 
in 

incorporating emojis into their 
platform. By 2010, Unicode — a 
group whose purpose is to establish 
text standardization across digital 
platforms — adopted and expanded 
emojis. Ever since then, emoji use 
has increased with new users, and 
new emojis are born on the regular.

What 
the 
Israel 
Museum’s 

“Emoglyphs” 
exhibition 
is 

attempting is a definitive linkage 
between these two histories. The 
exhibit is described as presenting 
“the metamorphosis of picture-
writing” from ancient Egypt to today 
— from hieroglyphics to emojis. The 
walls of the exhibit include side-
by-sides of emojis and Egyptian 
hieroglyphics that resemble one 
another. The stress on the similarity 
is in terms of the visual aspects of 
the characters. 

O

n May 21, Anthony Bouchard, 
a Wyoming state senator and 
candidate for Wyoming’s 

2022 at-large U.S. House seat election, 
announced — in an alleged attempt to 
get ahead of opposition researchers — 
that when he was 18, he impregnated 
a 14-year-old girl. He went on to 
compare the incident to Romeo and 
Juliet. This rightly led to widespread 
condemnation, including from his 
fellow Wyoming Senate Republicans, 
and will hopefully end any chance 
he has of making it to Congress. His 
campaign was notable in the first 
place primarily because of who it 
aimed to unseat — incumbent U.S. 
Rep. and recently removed House 
Republican Conference Chair Liz 
Cheney. Bouchard, like an ever-
growing list of candidates for her seat, 
has taken aim at Cheney for her vote 
to impeach former President Donald 
Trump in January for his alleged 
incitement of the storming of the 
U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, as well as her 
condemnation of false Republican 
claims of election fraud. Those actions 
also, as mentioned previously, led to 
House Republicans removing Cheney 
from her post as conference chair on 
May 12 and has made her a target of 
Trump’s, who has described her as “a 
bitter, horrible human being.”

Conversely, 
Cheney 
has 
only 

become 
more 
popular 
among 

Democrats, 51% of whom view her 
either somewhat or very favorably, as 
opposed to only 20% of Republicans. 

Many prominent Democrats have 
spoken in her defense, as well. 
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, 
D-Calif., stated that “reasonable 
Republicans across the country must 
take back their party” in response to 
her removal. Senate Majority Leader 
Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., described her 
ouster as a “new and very dangerous 
low point” for the GOP. President Joe 
Biden responded to the vote by saying 
that he doesn’t “understand the 
Republicans,” as well as exchanging 
a fist-bump with Cheney prior to his 
address to Congress.

While the statements from top 

Democrats are likely a political play 
to exploit any remaining anti-Trump 
sentiment for electoral ends — which is 
probably pointless, given Cheney’s low 
favorability among non-Democrats 
— the fact that she enjoys such strong 
support among Democratic voters 
is deeply concerning. While Cheney 
was undoubtedly correct in her 
condemnation of Trump and his false 
claims of election fraud — in contrast 
to most of the rest of her party — she 
has otherwise been a poisonous 
political figure who has stood against 
all values that progressive-minded 
people should hold dear. Democrats 
should not rehabilitate her solely for 
standing against a few of the worst 
excesses of Trumpism. Rather, they 
should celebrate that such a consistent 
evil-doer has been removed from a 
position of influence.

While Cheney has only been in the 

House for a little over four years, she 
has consistently been on the wrong 
side of issues. She was a virulent 
opponent of the Iran nuclear deal and 
a staunch supporter of Trump’s policy 
of re-applying devastating sanctions 
on the country. She opposed ending 
U.S. support for Saudi Arabia’s 
brutal invasion of Yemen, which she 
described as “intended to help our 
allies defend against threats to their 
security.” However, the worst among 
her offenses was her sponsorship 
in 2020 of an amendment to the 
National Defense Authorization Act 
that prevented the withdrawal of 
U.S. troops from Afghanistan unless 
a number of conditions were met. 
Chief among those conditions was 
assessing if any “state actors have 
provided any incentives to the Taliban, 
their affiliates, or other foreign 
terrorist organizations for attacks 
against United States, coalition, or 
Afghan security forces,” an obvious 
allusion to the now-largely debunked 
Russian bounty story. Time and time 
again, she has stood for increased 
U.S. aggression around the world, 
sometimes even beyond what the 
president from her own party wanted 
— not to mention her strong opposition 
to abortion rights or her aversion to 
addressing climate change.

Emojis aren’t hieroglyphs

Liz Cheney is getting kicked out by the Republican 

Party. You shouldn’t be crying for her.

so many others lacked was a set of 
parentheses and a sense of ambiguity. 
Specifically, the parentheses encom-
passing the “s” in parents were part 
of the educational revolution toward 
inclusive language that only came 
relatively recently. That letter encom-
passed by two curved brackets made 
having two parents optional — an 
option that this generation is the first 
to realize. Finally, being “incomplete” 
is an option rather than a burden. No 
longer should a child have to cram the 
names of both her mothers on one line 
for their field trip permission slip. No 
longer should a child have to submit 
information on an absent parent to 
receive financial aid. Beauty can be 
found in ambiguity and options.

Subtle changes in keystrokes, like 

the addition of parenthesis encom-
passing the “s” in parents, are impor-
tant to eliminate the idea of policy 
and paperwork as one-size-fits-all. In 
line with this mission, the Center for 
Research on Learning and Teaching, 
in tandem with LSA Inclusive Teach-
ing at the University of Michigan, 
has compiled extensive resources for 

instructors and administrators in the 
U-M community to foster an inclu-
sive learning environment, including 
in every character printed on syllabi 
or word spoken in in-person dialogue. 
Faculty and U-M commitment to fos-
tering diversity, equity and inclusion 
down to the punctuation in school 
paperwork is incredibly refreshing. 
A set of parentheses instituted with 
purpose is the “Michigan difference” 
I waited so long for.

Parentheses around the “s” in par-

ents mean a lot to me, and they should 
to you too. Hence, the collective mind-
set towards inclusive language is just 
as important as the University’s mis-
sion for supporting non-traditional 
students. Ambiguity and neutrality are 
the only way to make language one-
size-fits-all, and therefore, we are to be 
detailed in our quest to root out exclu-
sive words and phrases so that every-
one can fit the form.

Blame Goodwill for rising thrift store prices, not the girl on Depop

Fitting within the form

OPINION

 JULIA MALONEY | OPINION COLUMNIST

OLIVIA MOURADIAN | OPINION COLUMNIST

I

t’s no secret that thrift store prices 
have changed in the last decade, 
particularly at large corporations 

like Goodwill — as seen by comparing 
prices between past and recent ver-
sions of Goodwill’s Valuation Guide. 
After seeing these changes, my origi-
nal idea for this column was to argue 
that reselling thrifted pieces is unethi-
cal and exclusionary. With the rise 
of consignment apps like Depop and 
Poshmark, people can buy thrifted 
pieces at inexpensive prices, post them 
to the application at a marked-up price 
and make a profit in minutes. While 
I still consider this to be unethical in 
certain situations, there are many cir-
cumstances in which reselling can be 
sustainable and fair. Common argu-
ments I’ve found against secondhand 
reselling are that resellers take in-
demand items away from low-income 
communities, cause thrift store prices 
to increase and resell at inaccessible 
prices. Although there are many arti-
cles vilifying secondhand resellers as 
the source of these problems, the dis-
cussion of the ethics of secondhand 
reselling needs to be more nuanced to 
reflect the complexities of the $17.5 bil-

lion resale industry and its surrounding 
consumerist culture.

Considering only about 20% of the 

clothing Americans donate ends up 
being sold to consumers, the argument 
that resellers create scarcity within 
thrift stores is a limited one. In fact, 
most thrift stores are restocked daily 
and the never-ending cycle of consum-
erism and fast fashion prevents the 
majority of thrift stores from running 
out of donations. And this cycle was 
only intensified by COVID-19, with 
many stores unable to accept donations 
due to overflow. For most thrift stores, 
secondhand resellers are not “taking 
all the good stuff” — there are still mil-
lions of tons of clothing going to waste. 
 

Another common argument against 

reselling thrifted clothing is that it 
contributes to rising thrift store prices. 
Although there are specific examples 
of local thrift stores charging steep 
prices, there is little research on gen-
eral pricing trends in non-corporate 
thrift stores. Most evidence surround-
ing increasing thrift prices seems to 
come from corporate thrift stores such 
as Goodwill and The Salvation Army. 
While prices at these stores have been 

increasing with the rising popularity 
of secondhand reselling, it’s important 
to note that correlation is not causation. 
Even considering this rising popularity, 
the mass influx of affluent teenagers 
thrifting for fun every weekend likely 
contributes more to rising costs than 
individual resellers do.

Along with rising rent costs and 

inflation, with large thrift store chains, 
the incessant factor of corporate greed 
comes also into play. These companies 
are often non-profit organizations, yet 
their practices are far from socially 

beneficial. Under the guise of being a 
charity organization, Goodwill oper-
ates by paying many employees sub-
minimum wages. And with its history 
of anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination, The 
Salvation Army is not really a charita-
ble organization to rally around, either. 
When rising prices at these companies 
are used as an argument against sec-
ondhand reselling, we must recognize 
all of the factors that go into retail 
pricing before placing all the blame on 
resellers. In a society that prioritizes 
capitalistic gain, it is shortsighted to 

claim that secondhand resellers are 
the sole perpetrators of rising costs at 
these large corporations. Beyond that, 
given these companies’ tight-knit rela-
tionships with hypocrisy, the question 
of whether we should be supporting 
them at all must also be addressed.

In addition to being blamed as 

the cause of rising thrift store prices, 
resellers are often told their own 
resale prices are too steep. While it 
is difficult to determine how much 
resellers typically upcharge for the 
items they thrift, these prices cannot 
be compared to prices in thrift stores 
without taking into account the time 
and energy required to comb through 
the thrift store, potentially clean or 
even upcycle the item, take quality 
pictures of it and post it for sale. As Alli 
Vera, YouTuber and former Depop 
seller, said in a video on the gentrifica-
tion of thrift stores, “the customer is 
also buying that reseller’s ability to see 
the potential in things.”

t is so hard to be form-fitting. I 
am not talking about body size 
and appearance in clothing but 

rather the societal norms that have 
created a standardized and gendered 
framework in paperwork. Checking 
boxes and signing on lines is a pain 
in print. Turning in papers is a seem-
ingly mindless practice for those who 
fit the form, but to the students com-
ing from single-parent or non-heter-
onormative households, that blank 
second signature line or series of boxes 
left un-checked represents imprinted 
exclusivity that the school system has 
mindlessly perpetuated. 

With an impending semester 

comes a series of forms looming in 
your inbox — the Free Application 
for Federal Student Aid, often called 
the FAFSA, being the one that causes 
the most dread. A process that is sup-
posed to take less than an hour is 
instead a source of exhausting agony 
each year due to the seemingly unend-
ing pages that must be read and boxes 
that must be filled. Regardless of the 
size of the form, there is room for for-
mat improvement to streamline the 

process and accommodate those who 
don’t “fit.” Small details are a part of 
almost every school form — beyond 
just the FAFSA — which should be 
addressed in the push toward achiev-
ing inclusive language and its sub-
sequent positive effect on student 
morale, thus leaving no student lost in 
the process. Each student’s circum-
stance is unique, and there needs to 
be a comprehensive change towards 
adopting inclusive language down to 
every punctuation mark.

For me and others coming from a 

single parent or other non-traditional 
household, there is a specific box and 
line that causes our pens to shutter and 
clicks to be in question: the box that 
requires information about our par-
ents. When presented with a physical 
paper, my way of coping began with 
scratching out the “s” in parents as well 
as marking the blank line for “Father’s 
name” as “not applicable.” Blatant pen 
strokes did not fill the parental void, 
nor did they go unnoticed to those who 
received the form on the other end. 
Completeness is a necessity when fit-
ting within the form and, therefore, I 

was made to either feel incomplete or 
attention-seeking. 

The gendered plurality of the word 

“parents” is an unspoken stressor. It 
would be so much easier to write in 
two names, one male and one female, 
yet the second line and the letter “s” 
at the end of the word are intentional 
spaces that the form cannot begin to 
understand. That privilege of a “tra-
ditional” family is not one I have — in 
fact, it’s one most Americans don’t 
have. How dare the innocent 8-by-11 
sheet of paper or government website 
assume that I am a part of the 46% 
of young adults living in a traditional 
nuclear family structure. As with 
all things nuclear, it’s about time the 
concept of the standard family being a 
two-parent, man-and-woman house-
hold explodes. The seats and size of 
my family dinner table are without 
labels or standard measurement, and 
therefore, the school system should 
tread lightly when inquiring about 
those who fill or abandon said seats. 

The solution lies in punctua-

tion, and its arrival in paperwork is 
anything but punctual. What I and

The first solar eclipse of the year 

lands on June 10, while the new 
moon is in Gemini. The new moon 
heralds a new beginning for the 
signs, and the eclipse magnifies 
its effects. The moon in Gemini 
indicates an examination of how 
we communicate with others and 
learn new information. The sun’s 
conjunction with Mercury on the 
same day adds an extra emphasis on 
communication. Mercury still lingers 
in its retrograde orbit, but perhaps 
the conjunction and this solar eclipse 
will provide much-needed clarity 
in these confusing times. Just be 
careful not to chase every pipe dream 
following this eclipse.

Mars enters Leo on June 11, 

which brings immense passion and 
intensity. You may feel even more 
inspired than usual, but watch out 
for any fights that may break loose 
during this time. The moon enters 
Cancer on the same day, which 
encourages alone time and self-

healing: a calm start to a potentially 
chaotic period with Mars in Leo.

The Venus sextile with Uranus 

on June 13 brings surprising gifts to 
all signs. On the same day, the sun 
squares Neptune, which may cause 
communication issues and overall 
sluggishness.

The moon enters Leo on June 

14, which may inspire our creative 
pursuits but incite petty conflicts. 
Saturn squares Uranus on the same 
day, indicating either unwanted 
change or the inability to change. 
It will be easy to feel frustrated 
and stagnant at this time, but try 
to remain level-headed and do not 
force change if it is not working for 
you.

Aries (June 8-14)
You may often feel that your ideas 

are the best, but this solar eclipse and 
Sun-Mercury conjunction may lead 
you to re-evaluate your methods of 
living and how you can communicate 
with others in a more effective way. 
You will feel powerful enough to do 
anything when Mars, your ruling 
planet, enters fire sign Leo. The week 
ends with Saturn squaring Uranus, 

which means you may re-approach 
your 
friendships 
and 
consider 

whether or not your values align.

Taurus (June 8-14)
The solar eclipse may cause some 

sort of unexpected changes to your 
finances, so perhaps monitor your 
spending and be careful with your 
money. You may rearrange your 
living space to feel more comfortable 
when Mars enters Leo. When Saturn 
squares Uranus, you may reflect 
on your aspirations and come to an 
unexpected conclusion.

Gemini (June 8-14)
The new moon and solar eclipse 

occur in your sign. You will undergo 
the most major changes out of all of 
the signs, and you may be revisiting 
parts of yourself that you have 
hidden away in the past. Embrace 
the growth that comes with this new 
moon cycle. Mars in Leo will allow 
you to speak clearly and honestly. 
Not all introspection is easy, though; 
Saturn’s square with Uranus may 
cause you to question some of your 
long-held beliefs. 

Cancer (June 8-14)
The solar eclipse indicates a boost 

to your intuition, so trust yourself. 
You may also feel more tired than 
usual, and Mars’s transition into 
Leo may only further demotivate 
you. Venus’s sextile with Uranus 
is a great time to take a break from 
your solitude and connect with 
other people. When Saturn squares 
Uranus, you may reflect on your 
relationships and set new standards 
and expectations.

Leo (June 8-14)
You’re fulfilling an important 

role in your group (whether this is 
a community, social or professional 
environment), and this solar eclipse 
is asking you to find the courage to 
lead everyone on the right path. Mars 
enters your sign, which will give you 
a lot of energy for socialization and 
creative pursuits. The Venus-Uranus 
sextile also brings inspiration, but 
expect some setbacks when the sun 
squares Neptune on the same day. 
You may want to restructure your 
schedule and relationships when 
Saturn squares Uranus at the end of 
the week.

Virgo (June 8-14)
You 
may 
discover 
new 

opportunities under the light of the 
new moon, so be open to any shifts in 
your career goals. You will feel more 
energized than usual when Mars 
enters Leo, but do not bury yourself in 
work to repress your emotions. This 
is a fiery period of time, so you should 
resolve your frustrations before you 
explode in anger. You may want to 
restructure your daily routine when 
Saturn squares Uranus. Don’t just 
aim to be more productive, but think 
about your own mental well-being as 
well.

Libra (June 8-14)
Reevaluate your views about life 

because the new moon may bestow 
a new revelation about life onto you. 
Be open to receiving these new ideas. 
Socialization comes naturally to you, 
and Mars’s transit through Leo is a 
perfect time to connect with others. 
You may find that your usual routine 
isn’t working anymore when Saturn 
squares Uranus. This is a great time 
to change your goals and thought 
processes, especially regarding love 
and money.

“Dear Susan Muaddi Darraj,
My name is Reem Hassan, and 

I am a first-year undergraduate 
student at the University of Michigan-
Ann Arbor. I identify as a Muslim 
Palestinian American woman, and 
I am currently studying on a pre-
law track with hopes of majoring in 
public policy and minoring in Arab 
and Muslim American Studies. I was 
first introduced to your piece “It’s 
Not an Oxymoron” during my first 
semester in university, where I took an 
introductory course to women’s and 
gender studies (WGS). To say the least, 
I found myself absolutely astounded 
by your work. Having registered for 
the course on a whim and expecting 
to only mildly relate to the material, 
I was shocked to be so completely 
moved by our first reading. I explicitly 
remember feeling as though you had 
taken my thoughts on the intersection 
of my Arab identity on my feminist 
experience straight out of my head and 
put it on paper. I felt heard. Your short 
piece had the ability to influence my 
work for the rest of that semester and 
inspired me to take my understanding 

to new and deeper levels and enroll in 
our Arab American Feminists course 
this semester. Upon interacting with 
your piece yet again this semester, I was 
reminded of why it had such an impact 
on me, and how deeply I resonate with 
your story.” 

This is an excerpt taken from one 

of the first “Feminist Love Letters” 
I wrote last semester while taking 
an Arab American Feminists course 
with 
Professor 
Charlotte 
Karem 

Albrecht — an absolute icon in the WGS 
department. We were asked to address 
a “love letter” to one of the authors 
we had read in class, both celebrating 
and critiquing their work. I was 
immediately drawn to write to Susan 
Muaddi Darraj, who authored “It’s Not 
an Oxymoron: The Search for an Arab 
Feminism.”

****
Although I have always considered 

my feminist awakening as something 
deeply personal, I have come to learn 
that many other Arab American 
women empower themselves in a 
similar experience. It is an experience 
where we constantly question the 
grounds upon which we are allowed 
to call ourselves feminists, where we 
never feel as though we are allowed to 
call ourselves such a phrase because 

of western impositions onto the 
definition of feminism, and where we 
live an experience that we never feel 
like we have the right to articulate. 
In all truth, “Middle Eastern” (in 
quotations because the phrase is a 
colonial invention that I am not exactly 
fond of) or Arab women are not exactly 
regarded as the token feminist figures 
in the western lens. We are forced 
to carry a stereotyped reputation 
of arranged marriages, housework, 
oppression, being forced to cover up 
and countless other baseless tags and 
labels. And beyond this, even after 
I have finally come to understand 
what feminism really entailed, it was 
something that was treated with so 
much animosity by the people around 
me. In high school, boys amped up 
their “women belong in the kitchen” 
jokes and poked fun at the girls who 
identified as feminists for being “crazy.” 
Girls who were not interested in saying 
anything else only laughed with them. 
I remember watching in disgust and 
confusion as girls at my school — 
some of whom were even my friends 
— would proudly announce that they 
don’t consider themselves feminists 
just so that they’d be applauded by 
the boys. I could not fathom why they 
chose to view feminism as a surface-

level ideology, fixating on buzzwords 
like “man-hating” and “wage gap” 
while overlooking the societal benefits 
from the overarching goals of women’s 
liberation. 

On the other hand, I realized that 

feminism came so naturally to me 
because it did not defy the values or the 
practices that I was raised upon — it 
actually gave them a name. I grew up 
in a household where my sisters and I 
were encouraged to shoot for the stars 
and be ambitious with our goals, to 
defy gendered career expectations and 
to never give in to socially constructed 
gender roles. Both of my parents 
worked full time and distributed 
chores among themselves equally. I 
grew up watching my dad cook and 
clean and my brothers being given 
equal responsibility in maintaining the 
home. The contradictory attitudes that 
I encountered while coming to terms 
with my feminist identity motivated 
me to take Introduction to Women’s 
Studies upon starting at the University 
of Michigan. 

While much of the class was 

introducing and giving names to 
basic concepts like intersectionality, 
patriarchy and male-gaze, I noticed 
a 
vast 
difference 
between 
the 

backgrounds of the students who 

were enrolled in the course and how 
that influenced the ways in which 
they absorbed and comprehended 
the course material. I found myself 
engaged in productive conversation 
with students of color more than I did 
with the white students in the course. 
During the weekly discussion sections 
where we would share individual 
interpretations 
of 
the 
readings 

based on our own experience, I was 
shocked by how uninformed many 
of my white, straight, financially 
privileged, cisgender classmates were 
about the struggles that marginalized 
communities 
confront 
without 

reflecting on their own privileges. 
And while I would never deny the 
fact that objectively, being a woman 
in itself is a marginalized identity that 
suffers from patriarchal oppression, 
for me and other women of color, it is 
our intersecting identities that really 
amplify the impacts of being a woman. 
The yearning to have conversations 
with more people who understood 
how my intersectionality impacted my 
feminist experience prompted me to 
enroll in an upper-level Arab American 
Feminism course during my second 
semester.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com MICHIGAN IN COLOR

The scorching summer heat blasted 

my entire body as I opened the door 
to my childhood bedroom that had 
been frozen in time. After I froze in 
single-digit temperatures for the first 
time ever during my first semester of 
college, the uncomfortable, sweltering, 
Hawaiian air was comforting due to its 
familiarity; it felt like home.

My family had added new cabinets to 

the kitchen and painted the bathroom 
bright orange while I was gone, but my 
bedroom was exactly as I left it. The 

video game posters I bought in eighth 
grade remained pinned to the wall that 
I haphazardly painted blue in tenth. On 
my bookshelf, my elementary school 
summer reading books sat next to the 
Shakespearian plays I always nearly 
fell asleep reading. A framed Pokémon 
drawing made by a friend in sixth grade 
rested on my dresser beside my high 
school diploma. Collared shirts that my 
high school’s dress code required us to 
wear filled my closet. Even though I 
spent the last few months away from 
home, the placement of every mundane 
object was etched into my memory.

This bedroom was like an extra 

mental storage space for my memories. 

Any time a memory became lost in 
my jumbled consciousness, I could 
look at an object and almost relive 
all of the cringe-inducing, heartfelt 
or devastating moments. This small, 
square bedroom was also my sanctuary, 
whether I was trying to sneakily play 
Pokémon under the covers without my 
parents catching me or staying up until 
3 a.m. trying to finish a lab report. My 
childhood stuffed animals stared at me 
blankly, never judging me or expecting 
me to contort my personality to fit 
in with the crowd like I often felt my 
peers did. I was most free when I chose 
to lock myself away in my room.

Yet, walking into my bedroom felt 

as if I was disturbing a space that had 
retreated into a deep slumber. I sifted 
through old T-shirts from colleges I 
rejected and photos of people with 
whom I no longer keep in contact. I 
still hold the memories attached to 
each object, but I’m beginning to feel 
like this bedroom no longer knows 
me. I have no physical mementos of 
my first-year college experience and 
my internal growth in my nest of shiny 
objects. This room, with its old college 
essay drafts gathered in a pile on the 
ground, belongs to a version of myself 
that no longer exists. Everything in this 
room remained exactly where I left it, 
but I have changed. For the first time, 

my bedroom has not evolved with me.

After living away from home, I’ve 

gained more of an appreciation for the 
mundane. However, I know I cannot 
bring every single object with me into 
the next phase of my life. Walking 
back into my old bedroom felt like 
time traveling to the past, but now I’m 
looking toward the future. One day, I 
will leave this room for the final time, 
and I will not take my broken kendama 
or my scouting backpack with me. 
When that time comes, I will not be sad 
to let go of these relics of my childhood. 
Just like the old version of myself that 
is long gone, I think it soon will be time 
to bury this time capsule for good. 

Like most kids, I used to hate 

the rain – the gray skies, the slight 
emptiness in the roads due to the 
forecast and the sharp chillness all 
before the first droplets fell. I would 
get this pit in my stomach, an ominous 
feeling that made me nauseous. I 
disliked everything about the rain. 
The earthy smell when I first walked 
outside right after the storm. The 
continuous sound of the droplets 
hitting the roof. But what bothered me 
most was the thunder. 

Every storm, I’d go and sleep near 

my mother, and turn to her asking 
her to stay awake. She’d ask me if I 
was alright and I would respond with 
a simple “yeah,” too embarrassed to 
tell her I was scared, but she knew. 
Nightmares, storms or just scary 
thoughts always led to me asking her 
to stay awake. But she would listen, 
every night, and try her best to stay up 
until she accidentally closed her eyes 
for too long. Then it was just me, alone 
with the thunder.

Every 
possible 
frightening 

scenario would unfold in my head. 
The lightning would hit the house or 
the basement would flood, or worse: a 
tornado, since rainy season is tornado 
season. The power would go out, 
turning off my bright blue night light 
from Ikea and the red 3 a.m. written 
on the display of our alarm clock from 
the early 90s, and I would be left alone 
in darkness alongside the ear-splitting 
thunder. My mind continued to race 
until I finally fell asleep, exhausted 
from thinking too much. 

A few years later, my parents, 

brother and I had made the long flight 

to visit our family back home in Tamil 
Nadu, India. We were welcomed 
with warm genuine smiles from my 
grandmother and aunt along with the 
heavy thunderstorm amidst 98 degree 
heat. The 30-minute taxi drive home 
felt like hours with rain constantly 
pouring down the windows. Our 
suitcases tied to the top of the car 
absorbed every drop of water, leaving 
some of our belongings wet. The 
storm continued with heavy rain 
throughout the night and scattered 
thunder and lightning. 

After reaching the flat, the 

downpour only got heavier, but being 
a little older, I was not as scared as I 
used to be. Although I wasn’t terrified 
of the thunder, it still bothered me, 
spending long nights awake due to 
the mix of the loud storm and jet lag. 
While I couldn’t fathom the thought 
of thunder and lightning as positive 
occurrences, my aunts, cousins and 
grandmother were not even the 
slightest bit phased by the storm; if 
anything, they saw it as a good thing 
and were grateful. The dry, drought-
like heat of Chennai was temporarily 
suppressed 
with 
wetness 
and 

humidity. My aunt would leave the 
door to the ground-level balcony 
open so the uncomfortably hot flat 
would become slightly cooler. A sense 
of relief grew inside of me as the heat 
in the room became bearable.

My grandmother sat in the living 

room fanning herself with that week’s 
newspaper, while I played with my 
toys and watched the only English 
movie playing on TV, Planet of the 
Apes. The rain made the environment 
feel relaxing but at the same time, still a 
little uncomfortable. The same feeling 
of “the calm before the storm” arose 
except we were halfway through the 

storm, which always resulted in a 
common power outage. Even while 
quickly overheating to the point of 
sweat puddles surrounding me from 
the absence of air conditioning and a 
working ceiling fan, I found comfort in 
the sense of community these outages 
brought. With power, everyone was 
off doing their own thing, cooking, 
working or watching TV. But with 
the outage, everyone quickly came 

together. They’d walk into the living 
room with a slight sigh and a quick 
comment: “current pochu” (Tamil 
for “current went”). My aunt would 
go around lighting the candles in the 
flat and the small flame would light up 
the room just enough to see the color 
of her sari. We would talk nonsense 
while sitting on the couch, waiting 
for the power to return. My cousin 
would throw in a few harmless jokes 
about how I would sit with my feet off 
the ground to avoid the small lizards 
that constantly ran through the flat 
or about how I didn’t like the dark in 
order to lighten the mood and distract 

me. My aunt would nudge him telling 
him to stop teasing me and everyone 
would laugh. Then abruptly, the lights 
would turn back on, the conversations 
would end and life would continue 
just like that.

After coming back to Michigan, I 

was grateful the storms here weren’t 
as violent as they were in India. 
Life went on until we reached the 
first storm of the season, and I was 

surprisingly fine with it. I reminisced 
about the time I spent in India, where 
everyone felt relieved when it rained 
since the air was normally dry and the 
family came together and made jokes 
and told stories. The rain brought us 
all together. Thinking back to this 
sense of togetherness brought me to 
finally view the rain positively, the 
same way I did there. 

A few times, my family and I were 

able to experience a storm during our 
road trips. The lightning would flash 
and my mother would quickly order 
us to close our eyes and not look at 
the bright streak in the sky since she 

would always say the light is too 
bright for our eyes to handle. I would 
smile and nod as she said that, while 
directly staring at the lightning 
streak with dangerously wide-open 
eyes. I didn’t want to miss the slight 
purple hue that filled the sky, the 
beauty that I always seemed to miss 
since I closed my eyes and hid under 
the cover at the first sign of a storm 
for so long.

The 
best 
part 
of 
most 

thunderstorms is when friends or 
family are talking to a group and a 
sudden burst of thunder interrupts 
them. We all look at each other 
smiling but in slight disbelief of the 
thunder being that loud. Someone 
comments “Woah” or “That was 
loud” and the rest lightly laugh right 
before resuming the conversation 
exactly where it was left off. The 
thunder was like a break mid-
conversation. Not only does it break 
our conversation, but it breaks 
everyone in the vicinity of the storm’s 
conversations as well. We all hear the 
thunder at the same time, see the 
lightning at the same time and likely 
react to it at the same time. It’s like a 
forced connection between us all. It’s 
as if the thunderstorm was a break 
from regular fast-paced life itself, a 
midlife interruption, where we all 
pause for a minute and look around, 
before resuming back to our normal 
life the way my family in India does 
every storm. 

The thunder is loud, the rain makes 

the grass messy and the storm can be 
scary. But without the scariness and 
ugliness of the storm, there would be 
no purple hue lighting up the sky, no 
coolness in the air around my aunt’s 
flat and no brief moment of extra 
connection between us all.

For the past few days, social media 

has been awash in reactions to Bo 
Burnham’s new special, “Inside.” 
My Twitter and Instagram feeds 
are a constant barrage of glowing 
reactions to Burnham’s introspective, 
90-minute performance art piece. As 
I scroll through my Tiktok For You 
Page, songs from “Inside” play on 
endless fifteen second loops, worming 
themselves deeper into the app’s 
notorious algorithm the longer I listen 
to the lyrics repeat. 

When Bo suddenly announced 

he had a new special coming out 
this year, his fans, including myself, 
were ecstatic. After six years without 
performing live, no one was sure what 
“Inside” had in store. As someone 
especially moved by his 2018 film 
“Eighth Grade,” I was excited and also 

a little terrified. I knew that, no matter 
what, the special’s release would be An 
Event.

Just hours after “Inside” was 

uploaded to Netflix, friends and 
family started messaging me about 
what a masterpiece it was. And 
how weird it was. And how sad and 
heartbreaking and hilarious and 
troubling it was, which it is. “Inside” 
is all of these things rolled up and 
crammed into a tiny studio in Bo 
Burnham’s backyard. 

There is a magnitude to “Inside” 

that lets viewers know, from the 
first bars of its overture, that this is 
not just a momentary internet craze 
like “Tiger King” or “Bridgerton.” 
It’s meant to mean something to you 
and you singularly. It is addressed, 
signed, sealed and hand-delivered to 
you with a capital Y. And that’s why 
I refuse to tell you what I think of it.

There is no denying that “Inside” 

is good. Objectively, it’s a creative 

tour de force. The song “Welcome 
to the Internet” alone could have 
cemented the special’s place in 2021’s 
cultural history with its diatribes 
against technology-induced mania. 
Hundreds of thousands of people 
have latched onto the special’s 
messaging about the normalization 
of performance as an aspect of 
everyday life rather than something 
confined to a controlled setting, 
with the most vehement of those 
testimonials coming from social 
media. As Burnham snidely puts it, 
“The outside world, the non-digital 
world, is merely a theatrical space in 
which one stages and records content 
for the much more real, much more 
vital, digital space.” 

Fittingly, 
Burnham 
includes 

multiple scenes in which he points 
the camera in a mirror, capturing 
both himself and a reflection of the 
audience as we stare back at him; we 
are subject to the literal Black Mirror, 

the veneer of a screen that’s come 
to signal our fear of the future and 
ourselves. “Inside” begs us to look 
inward. It’s an exasperated response 
not only to the absurdity of pretending 
Everything is Fine in a near Huxleyan 
dystopia (see “Funny Feeling”), but 
also to the inability of anyone to 
experience genuine self-awareness 
without demanding someone bear 
witness. 

Burnham levels his final challenge 

to the viewer in the special’s grand 
finale “Potential Ending Song,” daring 
them to question their willingness to 
perform the passive role of spectator, 
one which risks nothing and yet 
demands “everything all of the time”: 
“Hey, here’s a fun idea, how ‘bout I 
sit on the couch and I watch you next 
time?” Right now, with all of our 
Tiktok and Tweets and half-baked hot 
takes we’re doing exactly that: playing 
our part. 

In return for a spectacular piece of 

entertainment, fans of Bo Burnham 
and “Inside” have reinforced the 
deeply intimate display of total artifice 
as consumable content for profit. 
It’s the exact kind of breakdown/
trainwreck/horror story we’ve been 
conditioned to devour. Like a reality 
show about how exploitative reality 
shows are, “Inside” has established 
itself as an Internet darling despite its 
pleas for us to put down the phone and 
go outside.

I’ll admit critique was my first 

instinct as well. The second I 
formed a rational thought about the 
special, I felt an impulse to divulge 
immediately about it on any platform, 
hoping someone might listen and 
identify with what I had to say. Like 
most members of my generation, 
I’ve been raised to believe my voice 
matters and that I should be heard.

I refuse to review Bo Burnham’s ‘Inside’

The Cephalopod Chronicles

Read more at michigandaily.com

Amid the glitz and glamour of the 

93rd Academy Awards, an unusual 
competitor emerged for the title of 
Best Documentary. Created by South 
African documentarian Craig Foster, 
“My Octopus Teacher” provides a 
poignant take on the fragility and 
sanctity of life through an unlikely 
lens. In his journey through the 
Great African Sea Forest, Foster 
details the life and times of one of the 
ocean’s most precocious and playful 
creatures: the common octopus.

In the wake of a personal crisis, 

Foster finds himself burnt out 
and depressed. On a whim, he 
decides to return to his childhood 
pastime 
of 
free-diving. 
Among 

the towering fronds of kelp, he 
encounters a strangely gregarious 
octopus. He returns every day to 
film and interact with her, forming 
a 
touching, 
unusual 
friendship. 

Unlike many of its contemporaries, 
“My Octopus Teacher” is no mere 
educational vessel. While viewers 
will undoubtedly gain considerable 
familiarity with the peculiarities 
of the species by the end of the 
documentary, its purpose is far 
grander in scope.

Our eight-legged ingenue captures 

the heart of not only Foster but the 
world through her surprising wit and 
indefatigable friendliness. Foster’s 
choice to pursue the same animal for 
an extended period of time creates 
an intimate connection between 
the octopus and the onlooker. It’s an 
unusual tactic to utilize in a nature 
documentary, but only adds to the 
quirky charm of the film. 

Cephalopods 
are 
the 
most 

intelligent species of mollusk, and 
the octopus’ situational resilience 
serves as proof. We see her hunting 
fish using Foster as a human barrier, 
using shells and seaweed to conceal 
herself from hungry sharks, and even 
walking across the ocean floor with 
her tentacles. She is able to change 
shape and color in order to mimic a 
piece of kelp, a rock, or even another 
marine 
animal. 
Her 
incredible 

intelligence is juxtaposed with her 
corporal fragility, as her body is 
essentially liquid. On average, her 
species only live to be about a year old, 
hence she must learn extraordinarily 
quickly. 

The cinematography is exquisite, 

the calming backdrop of ocean 
blurred sunlight and kelpy curtains 
setting the stage for a vibrant mise-
en-scène 
studded 
with 
aquatic 

actors of every shape and size. 
Co-directors 
Pippa 
Ehrlich 
and 

James Reed intersperse selected 

full-shots of the forest with intimate 
close-ups of Foster and his octopus 
friend. Capturing the vastness of the 
sea is both an insurmountable and 
overwhelming task, hence they elect 
a microcosmic approach to film-
making.

Indeed, 
the 
documentary’s 

greatest strength lies in the sense 
of intimacy it cultivates. Foster and 
the octopus forge a bond that can 
only be described as a friendship; the 
tone of the film is akin to that of the 
ever-popular dog movie. The octopus 
grants him the unique privilege to 
explore her ocean world, and become 
a part of her life. The occasional shot 
of the octopus latched onto Foster’s 
arm or chest is unexpectedly tender. 
One can’t help but wonder if she 
experiences, as Foster puts it, “some 
octopus level of joy.” 

The anthropomorphization of the 

octopus leaves both Foster and the 
audience emotionally invested in her 
wellbeing. In a nail-biting encounter 
with a shark, she is left wounded 
and incredibly weak. Foster initially 
does not intervene, as he wishes to 
preserve the boundaries of natural 
processes. However, he has become so 
attached that he eventually attempts 
to bring her food, hoping to nurse her 
back to health. Unlike most nature 
documentaries, Foster takes on the 
role of observer and participant. 

Instead of a detached narrator and a 
faceless camera operator, we see his 
experience interacting firsthand with 
the inhabitants of the kelp forest. 

Through his return to the natural 

world, Foster rediscovers the strength 
and beauty of the wild. Perhaps 
more importantly, he finds himself 
personally invigorated by the sense 
of peace and “octopus joy” the forest 
grants him. His initial depression and 
disenfranchisement with the world 
lessen considerably, and he learns 
to enjoy life again. Paradoxically, 
his time with the octopus actually 
improves his relationships with other 
human beings.

The unexpected humanity of the 

octopus truly drives the film home. 
The lifespan of an octopus grants 
us insight into the mysteries of life 
as a whole. An octopus doesn’t get 
the better part of a century to live. 
Everything they learn, they must 
learn quickly. The film concludes 
with the octopus retreating to her den 
to lay her eggs. As her journey comes 
full circle, we are left with the sinking 
feeling that accompanies nature’s 
inevitabilities. 

Her life emphasizes the cyclical 

nature of mortality; life is valuable 
because it ends, and meaningful 
because it continues. A few weeks 
after her death, Foster is free-diving 
with his son when he discovers a tiny 

octopus floating amid the waves. 
It’s the right species, and the right 
size—it could conceivably be one of 
her offspring. Even in her death, she 
continues to give. Her journey runs 
parallel to Foster’s relationship with 
his son; parental altruism transcends 
the species boundary. 

In the film’s conclusion, we see 

Foster tear up slightly at the thought 
of his cephalopod companion. To 
an outsider, the occurrence seems 
bizarre, but the arc of the film 
inevitably leads to this moment, for 
this is not an educational film or a 
scientific exposé on the behaviors 
of the common octopus — it’s a love 
story. 

The brilliance of “My Octopus 

Teacher” lies in its simplicity. 
It’s 
extraordinarily 
subjective, 

extraordinarily human. Ironically 
enough, the singularity of the tale 
is what makes it universal. For 
Foster’s octopus is by no means 
standard or commonplace. Rather, 
she defies the characteristics of her 
species through her social nature, 
her playfulness. She is intelligent and 
resilient, but so are most octopi. Her 
defining traits are those that make 
her less like an octopus, and more 
like a human. Her defining traits 
are those that make her less like a 
teacher, and more like a friend.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

The existence of black midi as a band 

should be used as primary evidence 
that reality is simply a simulation 
whose source code has been written 
by either Kurt Vonnegut or David 
Mitchell. This is not because of how 
strange its aesthetic is, although there 
aren’t many acts out there that can 
claim to rival it, but because of how 
it’s managed to captivate such a large 
portion of music fandom with their 
undefinable variation of rock.

For the most part, it doesn’t seem 

like audiences or the critical sphere 
knows what to make of them, aside 
from the fact that they are undeniably 
exciting. This whiplash is probably why 
so many were quick to place them in 
the same haphazardly conceived “UK 
experimental post-punk” movement 
as other bizarre rock groups from the 
scene. However, even on their debut 
record, black midi sounded slightly 
removed from such categorization. As 
if to prove that this wasn’t a fluke, their 
freshly released sophomore project 
feels like a band actively pruning itself 
from the musical zeitgeist. 

Schlagenheim challenged all of the 

conventions of noise and experimental 
rock while maintaining the youthful 
spirit and lack of self-importance that 
gave those genres their potency in the 
first place. It certainly has the energy of 

a debut. Cavalcade, on the other hand, 
feels like an entirely different beast 
altogether. Putting aside the vast and 
numerous sonic departures, there is 

a definitive atmosphere on Cavalcade 
that is completely removed from its 
predecessor. It seems as though black 
midi have approached the project with 
a heightened seriousness, as if to say 
“Well, we had our fun, now it’s time to 

really dive into the trenches.” Of course, 
there is a fine line to walk between 
seriousness 
and 
pretentiousness, 

especially with a band of their technical 

prowess, but their apparent lack of any 
overarching mantra naturally voids 
any potential pretense.

Our discussion begins with the 

opener “John L.” If there was any 
resistance to the idea that black midi 

isn’t out to be a crowd-pleaser, this 
track instantly quells it. Horns and 
guitars and drums are all layered 
precisely on top of each other often 
with total silence taking refuge in the 
space between. Every note feels like a 
blunted dagger being thrust through 
the chest. It’s one thing to take on this 
Frippian psychosis by itself; if one were 
going to do so, the Jodorowsky-meets-
Teletubbies-styled music video is the 
way to go. 

But 
the 
choice 
to 
follow 
it 

immediately with easily the most 
relaxed and pleasant song they’ve ever 
done is somehow more shocking than 
anything that happened on “John L.” 
The band ventures into late 60’s era 
prog on “Marlene Dietrich.” This is 
where it becomes clear that Geordie 
Greep has been developing his singing 
from Schlagenheim to Cavalcade. It 
reveals a softer nuance to his voice that 
was previously unexplored.

The middle portion of Cavalcade 

arguably works as one large suite 
that consists of several different 
pieces. There is a greater emphasis on 
transitions between songs, with the 
effortless glide between the dreamy 
soundscape of “Diamond Stuff” and 
the groovy punk rock of “Dethroned” 
being 
a 
particularly 
spectacular 

example of this. The album then 
finishes out with the nearly ten-minute 
avant prog epic “Ascending Forth”, 
which sees the band stretching their 
pathos as far as they can. Much like the 

title suggests, it certainly reaches the 
highest peak on Cavalcade, with the 
final moments reminiscent of the end 
credit curtain roll of a 1930s musical 
drama (perhaps the Marlene Dietrich 
reference was not as innocuous as 
previously thought). It’s the perfect 
closer to a project that feels so confident 
in its ambition.

Lyrically speaking, a first glance 

would suggest that black midi are 
working with the same cryptic and 
absurd messaging that defined much 
of their early work. But much like the 
first project, we would be ignoring 
the details that lie under the surface. 
Cavalcade goes even deeper, as it seems 
to be tying in a larger theme across its 
seemingly disparate track ideas. Each 
song presents the concept of a fall 
from grace in some manner. “John L.’’ 
tells the story of a cult leader whose 
members turn on him. “Slow” lays out 
the existential quandary that our only 
interaction with time is the process of 
it leaving us.

Unsurprisingly, 
the 
track 
that 

brings this all together is “Ascending 
Forth,” which, aside from the clever 
double meaning (ascending fourths), 
really gets at the heart of why the 
band decided to focus on such a dour 
subject. On the track, we are told the 
story of Markus, an artist living among 
orthodox monks who is struggling to 
create. 

Reviewing “The Anthropocene Reviewed”

I cannot buy a book before I’ve read 

it. Questions of limited funds aside, 
what if the book just sits on my shelf, 
unread until I move again? What if I 
hate the ending? The rational answer 
to my concern, of course, would be to 
return the book; however, returning 
a book requires effort and gas money. 
Besides, more than anything, buying 
a book is about trust — trust that 
it will subvert your expectations. 
It’s a leap of faith. So when I saw a 
signed copy of “The Anthropocene 
Reviewed” by John Green for the first 
time, I surprised everyone, including 
myself, by buying a copy. I wasn’t 
prepared to find a new favorite book.

Wherever I move, I will be 

taking this book with me. Green’s 
collection of personal essays about 
the 
Anthropocene, 
our 
current 

geologic age of unavoidable human 
influence, is easily digestible but 
incredibly complex. The book is 
composed of essays, or “reviews,” of 
different facets of the Anthropocene 
— anything from “Penguins of 
Madagascar” to “Auld Lang Syne” 
and “Sycamore Trees.” The idea was 
sparked when beloved brothers John 
and Hank Green found amusement in 
reviews of national parks on Google, 
leading them to come up with “The 
Anthropocene Reviewed,” a podcast 
in 2018, with episodes like “The 
Icelandic Hot Dog Stand and Signing 
Your Name 250,000 Times” or “Air 
Conditioning and Sycamore Trees.” 
Now, “The Anthropocene Reviewed” 
exists as a book, with excerpts from 
the podcasts, as well as new essays.

Green is known for his wildly 

divisive young adult novels but has 
most definitely hit his stride in writing 
non-fiction. The connection between 
his YA fiction and this collection of 

essays isn’t overt or noticeable (except 
for the parts where he mentions his 
books). Many of the dozens of deeply 
emotional and philosophical essays 
are around four to six pages. Due to 
their extraordinary nature, I’ve had 
to take multiple breaks reading this 
book. Green simultaneously paints 
a deeply honest roadmap of his life 
and the Anthropocene, focusing 
on coping with the condition of 
our deeply bizarre, ultra-modern 
world and unintentionally creating 
an unfinished list of reasons to love 
being alive. He writes with such 
unconditional love for the world — 
it’s no small feat to convince me that 
the answer to my problems is to visit 
Indianapolis.

As expected, a common theme 

is the magnitude of the Earth’s 
temporal range or range of existence 
in units of time. In an essay titled 
“Humanity’s 
Temporal 
Range,” 

Green writes, “We know we are 

circling a star that will one day 
engulf us. We’re the only species 
that knows it has a temporal range.” 
Green focuses on questions of relative 
temporal ranges by portraying our 
short but impactful time on earth and 
how he has come to terms with the 
inevitable destruction of humanity. 
In another essay on the Bonneville 
Salt Flats, Green writes, “In the age 
of the Anthropocene, humans tend to 
believe, despite all available evidence, 
that the world is here for our benefit. 
So the Bonneville Salt Flats must 
have a human use; why else would 
they exist? Nothing can grow in that 
dry, salty soil, but we find uses for it 
anyway.” Within the book, Green 
describes how humans manage to 
persevere as a species and wreak 
havoc upon the Earth. The Earth has 
existed for billions of years before 
us and will exist after. Humans tend 
to believe their impact is the most 
beneficial occurrence to ever happen 

to the Earth, but Green succeeds 
in making humans seem just what 
they are: mortal. That’s not to say the 
author underplays climate change. 
Humans, despite being clueless about 
the history before them, are both 
creative and destructive.

Green also observes phenomena 

surrounding humans that have lasted 
for thousands of years. While writing 
of the history of the treatment of 
Staphylococcus aureus, a bacteria, he 
mentions, “[Staphylococcus] doesn’t 
know about people. It just wants to 
be, like I want to go on, like that ivy 
that wants to spread across the wall, 
occupying more and more of it.” 
Perhaps Staphylococcus is Green’s 
apt metaphor in describing humanity; 
always evolving into a new form, 
but also fundamentally creative, 
destructive, parasitic and never-
changing in its identity.

STATEMENT

Macklemore and his contradictions: the unruly mess he 

has made 

In my middle-school world 

of Little League softball and 
sleepovers, 
I 
found 
myself 

listening to Macklemore’s (and 
Ryan 
Lewis’s) 
discussion 
of 

addiction, 
greed 
and 
failure 

throughout the album “The Heist.” 
Tuning out my parents’ car ride 
conversations and team chatter on 
the bus rides to basketball games, 
I let my headphones become the 
vessel into Macklemore’s much 
darker musings about critical 
issues I had not yet realized or 
experienced. 

No one in my social circle was 

openly gay until I got to high school, 
but “Same Love” introduced me to 
and harnessed my empathy and 
support for same-sex marriage, 
an issue I had no connection 
to at the time. I learned what 
“lean” meant after listening to 
“Otherside” and googling the abuse 
of cough syrup. Prior to hearing 
“Thrift Shop,” Goodwill was only 
a place to donate clothes, not to 
buy them. Before I experienced 
“Wing$,” I never contemplated 
why I preferred Nike over Under 
Armour. Human rights, substance 
abuse and consumption contribute 
to the central themes of the album. 
At the time that I first encountered 
“The Heist” as a relatively sheltered 

middle schooler, I hadn’t devoted a 
lot of time to thinking about those 
things. 
Nevertheless, 
I 
found 

myself feeling a deep emotional 
connection 
to 
Macklemore’s 

philosophy of fighting for gay 
rights and battling inner demons 
throughout “The Heist”, a bizzare 
connection I could not explain 
with my middle-school mind.

Since 
stumbling 
upon 
his 

Grammy award-winning album, I 
have become much more familiar 
with Macklemore and his music, 
from 
the 
nostalgic 
tones 
of 

“Growing Up” and “Good Old Days” 
to the more bizarre sentiments 
of “Brad Pitt’s Cousin” and “How 
to Play the Flute.” I have taken on 
the shared philosophical weight of 
“This Unruly Mess I’ve Made” and 
observed his anecdotal reflections 
on childhood and religion in 
“Gemini”.

At the end of 2020, I found 

Macklemore’s 
first 
full-length 

album, “The Language of My 
World,” 
which 
covers, 
among 

many other topics, his childhood 
observations 
of 
socioeconomic 

strata, his first experiences with 
alcohol and illicit substances, and 
the track “White Privilege” (which 
would be followed by the better-
known “White Privilege II” on a 

later album). The 2005 album’s 
discussion of social issues still 
present and exacerbated by the 
pandemic made “The Language 
of My World” seem like it could 
have been penned in 2020. “The 
Language of My World” fleshes out 
Macklemore’s personal reflections 
of growing up in a segregated 
Seattle as a well-off white kid. 
It 
provides 
compelling 
social 

commentaries, all of which seem 
to be perplexingly embodied by 
the track “Contradictions,” which 
boasts the hook: 

“Consumption, contradiction/
I’m conflicted with being a 

hypocrite/

And through these songs you 

can witness it/

The differences, I admit this 

shit, because I’m just like you/

Walking a fine line between 

saying and living it”

Since my initial middle-school 

musings on Macklemore’s more 
palatable (or at least, commercially 
successful) tracks, I have been 
able to identify the potential 
contradictions of his career and 
artistry.

After 
all, 
Macklemore 
is 

an 
A-list 
celebrity 
critiquing 

those who buy into and practice 
conspicuous consumption in songs 

like “Thrift Shop” and “Need to 
Know.” Conscious consumption is 
somewhat of an unusual position 
to advocate for in popular music, 
and bringing it up seems like an 
admirable undertaking. However, 
he romanticizes overbuying and 
rocking used clothing without 
a mention of gentrification in 
“Thrift Shop.”

Considering the bigger picture, 

Macklemore attacks conspicuous 
consumption in his signature 
song, exclaiming “Fifty dollars 
for a T-shirt/ that’s just some 
ignorant bitch/ I call that getting 
swindled and pimped.” Explicitly 
mentioning the entrapments of 
buying Gucci, he cautions “Trying 
to get girls from a brand?/ Then you 
hella won’t.” By his own definition, 
Macklemore’s been swindled by 
the same systems and propaganda 
he so famously preached against. 
Instagram posts and interviews 
reveal his adornment of Gucci 
and expensive accessories like 
Louis Vuitton duffle bags and 
Rolex watches. Even if the Gucci 
hats and shirts are fake, as he has 
claimed, it is a blatant violation of 
the ideology propagated in one of 
his biggest hits.

Though 
he 
preaches 
from 

a 
perspective 
of 
conscious 

consumption in “Thrift Shop,” 
he also admits numerous ways 
in which he has failed this ideal, 
including his being seduced by 
his lifelong, very American dream 
of buying a Cadillac in “White 
Walls.” 
Macklemore 
describes 

the sentiments attached to the 
purchase: “I’m rollin’ in that same 
whip that my granddad had/ Hello, 
haters, damn y’all mad/ 30k on the 
Caddy, now how backpack rap is 
that?”

Taking a more contentious tone 

towards our economic system, 
Macklemore dedicates an entire 
song, “Wing$,” to chronicling his 
lifelong struggle between having 
a love for sneakers and addressing 
the relationship of such a passion 
with conspicuous consumption, 
socioeconomic 
inequality 

and shallowness. In the song, 
Macklemore looks in the mirror, 
challenging himself: “Will I stand 
for change or stay in my box?/ 
These Nikes help me define me/ 
But I’m trying to take mine off.” 
Macklemore concludes that he has 
learned “For a hundred dollars 
and some change/ Consumption is 
in the veins/ And now I see it’s just 
another pair of shoes.”

 Reflections on Gen Z’s image 

When 
I 
typed 
“Why 
is 

Generation Z…” into Google, the 
first autofill suggestion was “so 
soft.” The second was “so sensitive.” 
Next 
was 
“entitled,” 
followed 

by 
“different,” 
“anxious” 
and 

“stressed.”

It feels like Gen Z — which is 

largely agreed to include anyone 
born from 1997-2012 — is quickly 
surpassing Millennials as the least-
liked generation.

Article after article details how 

damaged we are by any number 
of metrics, most using outdated 
phrases like “Ok boomer” we are 
supposed to find relatable. We’ve 
been called the lonely generation, 
the pessimistic generation, the 
saddest generation. For all of these 
various issues, there has been one 
essential culprit: social media.

There are certain parts of this 

narrative that I really see myself 
in. I’m probably what someone of 
an older generation would call a 
liberal snowflake and am fairly 
active on Instagram and Snapchat. 
Especially in high school, I was 
very preoccupied with tangible 
markers of success like grades and 
test scores, supposedly another 
marker of our generation.

Even on the statistical level, I 

seem to fit in. Studies have shown 

we’re less likely to get our driver’s 
license, date or spend as much time 
with friends; I didn’t get my license 
until I was 18 and didn’t have my 
first boyfriend until I was 20. 

But there are other Gen Z 

stereotypes that I really don’t 
connect to at all. For example, I 
don’t see this sad, social-media 
obsessed loner in myself, my 
friends or my classmates. I talked 
to Nick Brdar, the president of the 
Wolverine Support Network, about 
my concerns. He struggled with 
his mental health earlier in high 
school, but by the time Nick got to 
college, he was looking for a way to 
maintain his positive mental state. 
Through WSN, he’s been able to not 
only help himself but also channel 
his longtime passion into a type 
of advocacy to help others. So, of 
course, he’s heard the narrative 
about Gen Z before. 

“I definitely struggle with it 

because … social media does have 
harmful impacts, especially on 
teenagers’ and adolescents’ mental 
health,” Nick said. “So there’s 
that. But I also am well aware that 
social media isn’t the one thing 
causing people’s mental health to 
look differently in this generation. 
… When an article is portraying 
that as the full story, it’s definitely 

frustrating to me.”

We have a lot to be anxious 

about — a global pandemic, the 
threat of global warming, conflict 
in the Middle East, an economic 
downturn as we get ready to 
enter the workforce — but I’d say 
we’re remarkably well adjusted, 
all things considered. Of course, 
there are the Greta Thunbergs 
and David Hoggs of the world who 
are already creating change on 
the international level, but even 
in my own small social circles, 
I’m constantly amazed by acts of 
resilience in the face of adversity. 
There was my roommate who aced 
her test after contracting COVID-
19 and quarantining in her bedroom. 
Or my friend who (like myself) has 
received one internship rejection 
after another this year, each time 
taking a moment to readjust and 
then crafting a new cover letter. 
It feels like the articles I read talk 
about all the times we fall down 
without saying how many times we 
get back up. 

Part of that resilience could be 

tied to our willingness to seek out 
mental health resources. Mental 
Health Awareness Month, which 
happens in May, began in 1949 but 
didn’t get widespread attention 
until much later. In the early 

2000s, the focus of mental health-
focused organizations like the 
Mental Health Foundation shifted 
from solely addressing those with 
diagnosed mental health issues to 
promoting positive mental health 
for all.

By virtue of growing up in 

an epoch of periodic economic 
and 
geopolitical 
crises, 
our 

generation has taken to mental 
health awareness more than any 
generation before. We’re more 
likely to self-report as anxious and 
stressed but also more likely to seek 
help.

While it is possible that we really 

are the stressed and depressed 
generation, another possibility is 
that Gen Z is merely more willing 
to open up about their mental 
health. Mental health issues have 
existed in every generation, but our 
awareness today is causing us to 
treat things that, in the past, would 
have been ignored. As Nick pointed 
out during our call, everyone 
experiences change in their mental 
health throughout their lives; what 
is important is how we decide to 
address that change.

Not only are we more likely to 

seek help, but we’re also more open 
to talking about it than previous 
generations. Especially in the past 

year, my roommates and I have 
talked frequently about our mental 
states. I’ve been out to dinner with 
friends more than once when the 
conversation has turned to whether 
or not we like our therapists.

Millennials got the reputation 

for putting only the most beautiful, 
well-lit versions of their lives on 
social media, though now it feels 
like Gen Z is opening up a small 
corner of the internet where people 
are willing to drop the facade. That 
corner is the home of crying selfies 
(of which I have 12 in my camera 
roll), self-deprecating memes and, 
sometimes, admissions that we’re 
not ok.

I see friends and classmates 

and 
acquaintances 
frequently 

posting about the importance of 
mental health on social media. A 
lot of the time, it’s graphics that list 
statistics or resources you can look 
to or places to donate, but what’s 
struck me is how many people are 
sharing their personal stories. I’ve 
seen paragraphs of text detailing 
peoples’ struggles after losing a 
parent or a job. I know someone 
who made an entire Instagram 
account to document their recovery.

Nine Wolverines receive 

all-conference recognition

Baseball Beat predicts Michigan’s fate

The 
Michigan 
baseball 

team 
is 
well 
represented 

on this year’s all-Big Ten 
teams, which were chosen 
by conference coaches and 
announced 
Sunday. 
Nine 

Wolverines — five position 
players and four pitchers — 
received recognition. 

Sophomore second baseman 

Ted 
Burton 
and 
redshirt 

sophomore left-hander Steven 
Hajjar both made the all-

Big Ten first team. Despite 
coming into his starting role 
midway through the season, 
Burton managed to lead the 
team in average (.355) and OPS 
(1.118), and finished among 
team leaders in homers (6) 
and doubles (12). Hajjar had a 
consistently excellent season, 
throwing five-plus innings in 
all of his 13 appearances and 
earning seven quality starts.

Fifth-year catcher Griffin 

Mazur, fifth-year shortstop 
Benjamin 
Sems, 
sophomore 

left fielder Tito Flores and 
sophomore 
right-hander 

Cameron Weston made the 
second team. Mazur developed 
from a light-hitting catcher at 
Irvine to a slugger at Michigan 
(6 homers, 33 RBI), likely 
earning himself a selection 
in the 2021 MLB draft in the 
process. 
Sems 
made 
many 

acrobatic plays in the field and 
consistently 
contributed 
on 

offense (team-leading 41 runs). 
Flores overcame a midseason 
slump and finished as one 

of the Wolverines’ premier 
hitters (team-leading 36 RBI). 
Weston led all starters in ERA 
(2.40) and WHIP (1.12), and 
tossed a complete-game one-
hitter against Michigan State. 

Sophomore first baseman 

Jimmy Obertop and junior 
right-hander 
Willie 
Weiss 

made the third team. Obertop 
missed some time with an 
injury, but still finished with a 
team-leading 10 homers. Weiss 
made 
several 
multi-inning 

saves and allowed only seven 
earned runs all season. 

One player from each Big Ten 

team earned a Sportsmanship 
Award. 
Graduate 
right-

hander Joe Pace is Michigan’s 
recipient. 

“He’s a super hard worker 

and a great ambassador to 
Michigan 
baseball,” 
Mazur 

said of Pace. “He’s a classy guy. 
I think everybody respects him 
…. He’s definitely incredibly 
deserving of that award.”

Sophomore 
right 
fielder 

Clark Elliott and fifth-year 
third 
baseman 
Christian 

Molfetta are notably absent 
from the all-Big Ten teams. 
Both 
were 
extremely 

dependable 
in 
the 
field 

and important cogs in the 
Wolverines’ offense. 

“It was a crowded ballot this 

year, with a lot of deserving 
kids on it,” Michigan coach 
Erik Bakich said. “I didn’t 
really think that those two 
guys 
got 
snubbed. 
I 
just 

thought it spoke more to the 
strength of the conference and 
the caliber of players in the 
conference.”

Jack Whitten: 
There’s 
a 
viral 
video 
of 

Michigan coach Erik Bakich 
excitedly jumping off the team 
bus in South Bend. I hope he 
told the driver to keep it idling 
outside the stadium, because the 
Wolverines won’t be there for 
long. 

This weekend, the Michigan 

baseball team will need to win 
three or four games to win the 
regional. The last time it won 
three or more games in a weekend 
series was in early March against 
a terrible Purdue team. For the 
remainder of the regular season, 
the Wolverines failed to sweep a 
three-game series or win three 
of four, and it played only two 
regional-caliber teams in that 
time. 

In light of that, I will be 

shocked if Michigan wins the 
three or four games required to 
advance. I don’t think they can 
dominate an entire weekend 
of play against this caliber of 
competition.

But I do see a path forward 

for the Wolverines. Redshirt 
sophomore 
left-hander 
Steve 

Hajjar and sophomore right-
hander Cameron Weston will 
have to go extremely deep into 
games — I mean eight or nine 
innings each — to keep the 

bullpen’s best arms fresh and 
ready to relieve senior left-hander 
Ben Dragani in the third game.

Michigan’s offense must carry 

its winning approach into every 
pitch, and if the Wolverines do 
lose a game, hitters must remain 
disciplined and not freak out. 

Michigan’s excellent defense is 

extraordinarily unlikely to cost it 
a win, but the unit could improve 
if junior second baseman Riley 
Bertram breaks out of his slump, 
retakes the position and moves 
sophomore Ted Burton over to 
first base, allowing sophomore 
Jimmy 
Obertop 
to 
be 
the 

designated hitter. 

Even if all that happens, and 

Michigan plays its best baseball 
of the year, I’m not positive it will 
be enough to win the weekend. 
But at the very least, I think the 
Wolverines will vindicate the 
selection committee’s decision 
to give them a bid by winning a 
game and losing the others with 
dignity.

Steel Hurley:
I’m a bit more optimistic 

about the Wolverines’ chances 
than Jack is; the frontline duo of 
Hajjar and Weston has the ability 
to dominate any lineup, while the 
offense is powerful and explosive.

But 
too 
many 
Michigan 

players are trending in the wrong 
direction. Obertop has not been 
the same since his mid-season 
knee injury— he hit eight home 
runs in 22 games prior to the 

injury and has just two in his 18 
games since returning. Other 
players have fallen off a bit as 
well; graduate transfer infielder 
Christian Molfetta was hitting 
a scorching .349 after the same 
first 22 games, yet fell off to just 
.284 by the end of the season and 
was subsequently moved down in 
the batting order.

Burton—a first team all-Big 

Ten selection—and sophomore 
outfielder Tito Flores have been 
on fire lately, but they can’t be 
asked to carry as much of the load 
as they have lately if this team is 
to make a run in the postseason.

From 
a 
talent 
standpoint, 

Michigan is good enough to make 
it out, and everyone knows by 
now about the experience of the 
run in 2019 that this team can 
draw on. But the pitching depth is 
a bit of a question mark, even this 
late in the season, while the bats 
have gone cold for long stretches 
before. If Michigan drops into the 
loser’s bracket at any point, it will 
likely be too difficult to make it 
back. Thus, I am predicting that 
Michigan will fall to Notre Dame 
in the regional final, but this 
region could definitely be a wild 
one and I do think the Wolverines 
have a decent chance to make it 
out on the backs of Hajjar and 
Weston— if the team can get 
production from the bottom of 
the order.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com SPORTS

After 
taking 
a 
strike, 

sophomore designated hitter 
Ted Burton stepped back into 
the batter’s box and pulled 
the second pitch of his fourth-
inning at-bat over the left-
field wall for a solo home run. 
The homer, and junior second 
baseman Riley Bertram’s third-
inning double, looked like signs 
that the Michigan baseball team 
had figured out Connecticut 
starter Austin Peterson and 
would begin to pile on the 
offense. 

Instead, 
Burton’s 
homer 

would be the second and final 
hit registered by the Wolverines 
in their 6-1 loss to the Huskies. 
Michigan threatened in other 
ways, walking six times and 
getting hit by three pitches, but 
the offense completely failed 
to capitalize on those scoring 
opportunities, hitting 0-11 with 
runners on base. 

“We drew a lot of walks and 

had some hit-by-pitches tonight, 
but we just didn’t hit,” Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich said. “It was 
not a good offensive day for us, 
and that was the difference.” 

The Wolverines put their 

first men on base in the top of 
the third. After two quick outs, 
Bertram’s double brought up 
the top of the order, and when 

sophomore right fielder Clark 
Elliott followed with a walk, 
Michigan threatened a two-
out rally that could change the 
momentum of the game. But 
sophomore 
left 
fielder 
Tito 

Flores, batting far above his 
usual position in the seven-
hole, ended the inning by lining 
out. 

Sophomore 
first 
baseman 

Jimmy Obertop began the top 
of the fifth by getting hit by 
a pitch, but his teammates 
couldn’t 
take 
advantage 
of 

the leadoff baserunner. Fifth-
year center fielder Christan 
Bullock and Bertram struck out 
swinging and Elliott flew out.

“I think guys were trying 

to do a little bit too much,” 
redshirt sophomore left-hander 
Steven Hajjar said. 

Long swings and a lack of 

plate 
discipline 
have 
been 

hallmarks of the Wolverines’ 
worst 
defeats 
this 
season, 

including last night’s. 

When Flores and Burton both 

reached base in the sixth, they 
attempted a double steal of 
second and third in an effort 
to break the 1-1 tie. Flores was 
thrown out at third. Fifth-year 
catcher Griffin Mazur followed 
with a walk, but the second 
flyout of the inning ended the 
threat. 

“I liked our preparation and 

I liked our approach,” Bakich 
said. “We made too much weak 

contact and too many outs in 
the air.” 

The top of the ninth opened 

with yet another flyout before 
Obertop 
and 
Bullock 
drew 

consecutive walks. Michigan 
couldn’t punish Connecticut for 
pitching around them; Bertram 
and Elliott struck out swinging 
to end the game, recording the 
ninth and tenth strikeouts in 
the process. 

The offense now has the 

unenviable task of rebounding 
in the high-stakes, must-win 
game against Central Michigan 
tomorrow. The Wolverines are 
confident in their ability to do 
just that. 

“If we play like we played 

tonight, the season is going to 
be over tomorrow,” Bakich said. 
“If I know these guys the way I 
think I know these guys, they’ll 
respond.” 

Added Hajjar: “I’m expecting 

the bats to be getting hot right 
about now. They’re warming 
them up as we speak, I think, 
and by tomorrow they’ll be red 
hot.”

Quiet offense dooms Michigan as Wolverines fall to UConn

Graduate 
transfer 
catcher 

Griffin Mazur swung and skied a 
pop-up to center field, where it was 
caught and stranded a runner in 
the eighth inning. The out summed 
up the evening for Michigan, as 
the offense sputtered and never 
got going against the Connecticut 
Huskies.

The Michigan baseball team 

(27-18 Big Ten) fell to the Huskies 
(34-17 overall, 13-4 Big East) 6-1 
in the opening game of the NCAA 
tournament.

Redshirt sophomore left-hander 

Steve Hajjar was on the hill for the 
Wolverines and had a solid outing, 
dominating early in the game before 
getting touched up late. Hajjar went 
six innings, allowing four runs 
while picking up nine strikeouts. 
Hajjar used his changeup very 
well, picking up a lot of swings and 
misses during his outing.

“Steve has been really good lately 

and he gave us a chance to win, 
which was a good game through 
five innings,” Michigan coach Erik 

Bakich said. “Then they scored 
two runs on a little squibber. … 
And that’s baseball, but if we were 
doing a better job offensively that 
might not have made such a big 
difference.”

Bakich made two big lineup 

decisions in centerfield and at 
designated hitter. He elected for 
the experience and defense of fifth-
year outfielder Christian Bullock 
and junior infielder Riley Bertram, 
who slotted in at second base and 
moved sophomore infielder Ted 
Burton to designated hitter.

“We decided to play the two 

guys who have played in regionals 
before,” Bakich said. “They bring 
the best defense and they also can 
handle the bat.”

Bertram proved Bakich right in 

his decision to roll with experience, 
coming up with a double to the gap 
in the third inning for Michigan’s 
first hit of the game. After a walk by 
sophomore outfielder Clark Elliott, 
sophomore outfielder Tito Flores 
came up with two on and two out. 
He pulled a line drive into the left 
field corner, but a leaping catch by 
the Husky outfielder prevented 
Bertram and Eliott from scoring to 

keep the game deadlocked at 0.

Bullock, too, delivered fantastic 

defense, including a spectacular 
diving catch in the eighth inning to 
rob an extra-base hit. Bullock also 
registered a walk in the game.

Hajjar ran into a bit of trouble in 

the fourth, where UConn opened 
the scoring. With a runner on 
third and two outs, Flores dove for 
a line drive in an attempt to save 
a run. But he was unable to make 
the diving catch, allowing a run to 
score and giving the Huskies a 1-0 
lead.

Michigan 
responded 
in 
the 

next inning, as the red-hot Burton 
ripped a solo shot to left to even the 
score at 1-1.

“We drew a lot of walks and had 

some hit by pitches tonight but we 
just didn’t hit,” Bakich said. “It was 
not a good offensive day for us and 
that was the difference. … We just 
didn’t have anything going.”

UConn finally did real damage 

to Hajjar in the sixth. A single and 
a perfectly executed hit-and-run, 
where the runner on first stole 
second, forcing Bertram to cover 
second while the batter slapped 
the ball through the vacated area 

between first and second, and 
where Bertram was put the Huskies 
in position to score. An RBI single 
from the next batter gave UConn a 
2-1 lead.

But the damage was not done. 

After catcher’s indifference set up 
second and third for UConn, an 
infield single allowed both runs to 
score, pushing the Husky lead to 
4-1.

Hajjar exited after the sixth, 

making way for graduate transfer 

right-hander Will Proctor. But 
Proctor did not fare better than 
Hajjar. A leadoff double and a bunt 
single set the table for Husky Erik 
Stock— who was already 3-for-3 
on the day. Stock improved his line 
further, launching a double into 
left field and plating both runners, 
forcing Proctor out of the game 
before he got any outs with the 
score 6-1.

Fifth-year outfielder Christian 

Bullock slapped a ground ball up 
the middle, where the shortstop 
fumbled it. The bases were loaded 
with no one out for the top of the 
Wolverine order in the seventh, 
with sophomore outfielders Clark 
Elliott and Tito Flores coming to 
plate. After Elliott worked the count 
to 3-and-0, Michigan finally looked 
like it might get back in the game.

But Elliott went down looking 

after three straight strikes, and 
Flores — arguably the Wolverines’ 
most productive hitter on the day 
— grounded softly into a double 
play to end the threat with no runs 
scored. The failure to produce with 
runners on base plagued Michigan 
all day against Central Michigan 
and ultimately sunk the Wolverines 
in a season-ending 8-2 defeat. 

Michigan struggled to string 

together timely hits with runners 
on base. The Wolverines recorded 
nine total hits but all of their runs 
came via the home run with two 
solo shots. 

“Not only did we not string the 

hits together,” Michigan coach 

Erik Bakich said. “There was one 
inning where we strung a couple of 
hits together, and then missed the 
scoring opportunity with the bases 
loaded and nobody out, that was 
huge.”

On a day where the wind was 

blowing out, carrying a lot of 
routine fly balls near or over the 
wall, the offense was on display 
for both teams — they racked 
up a combined 20 hits. Yet, the 
Wolverines struggled to break 
through and plate runs, even though 
they hit much better than they had 
the game before.

“We had nine hits but (weren’t) 

getting them back to back and 
getting the big hit,” Bakich said. 
“Two home runs today but they 
were solo shots. (It) would have 
been nice to have those (homers) 
with runners on and we just didn’t 
string them together, just didn’t do 
it.”

The Chippewa pitchers did an 

excellent job of throwing strikes all 
game, allowing no walks and no hit 
by pitches — muting the effect of the 
hits Michigan had.

“They had pretty good pitchers,” 

sophomore infielder Jimmy Obertop 
said. “We just needed to compete a 
little more. We’ve worked so hard, 

prepared for these moments, it just 
didn’t go our way today.”

The Wolverines went 2-for-11 

with runners on base and picked 
up no extra-base hits or RBI with 
runners on base.

“We 
really 
don’t 
have 
any 

excuses,” Bakich said. “We didn’t 
hit well enough to be a factor in this 
regional.”

In the end, Michigan hitters went 

cold at the worst time, ending the 
Wolverines’ season.

“The way we prepared, we 

worked so hard this year,” Obertop 
said. “It’s a bummer, the way it 
ended. Our bats just went cold at 
the wrong time. Obviously you can’t 
plan for that. We’ve just worked so 
hard, and it just did not go the way 
we wanted.”

Michigan eliminated by Central Michigan, 8-2

With the season on the line, 

Michigan 
coach 
Erik 
Bakich 

put the ball in the hands of 
his usual Saturday starter. But 
sophomore right-hander Cameron 
Weston was not his usual self 
against Central Michigan. He 
was continuously hit hard and 
struggled with his command at 
times. He ended up with a line 
of four and two-thirds innings, 
eight hits, five earned runs, and 
only struck out two batters. While 
Weston was less than stellar, the 
blame does not fall solely on him.

“They have to remember what 

this tastes like,” Bakich said. “Use 
it as fuel for future seasons. For 
most of them, it was their first 
time (in the postseason). It was 
very valuable that they got that 
experience.”

In the bottom of the fifth, 

Bakich went to his bullpen. He 
brought on freshman left-hander 
Logan Wood. Like Weston, the 

Chippewas found success against 
Wood. He faced two batters and 
walked both of them, forcing 
Bakich to switch relievers. Sixth-
year right-hander Joe Pace came 

in and was unable to shut down 
Central Michigan. He pitched one 
inning and struck out two, but had 
to throw 32 pitches and allowed 
two runs.

Even though the offense has 

struggled lately, they took charge 
early. With one out in the top 
of the first inning, sophomore 
outfielder Tito Flores jumped on 

a pitch and sent it over the wall 
in right field. After that, however, 
the Wolverines fell back into a 
slump. 

In the top of the second inning, 

it looked like Michigan was going 
to strike again. Fifth-year catcher 
roped a one-out double off the 
top of the wall in left. Sophomore 
first baseman Jimmy Obertop 
and 
junior 
second 
baseman 

Riley Bertram each struck out, 
disappointingly ending the inning.

The offense looked good in the 

beginning stages, but they did not 
build any momentum. Six different 
batters recorded a hit, but they 
left seven runners stranded. They 
made solid contact, but every 
time they had an opportunity the 
Chippewas shut them down.

They managed eight hits on 

the afternoon but generated only 
two runs. In the top of the ninth, 
trailing 8-1, Obertop launched a 
home run. Michigan has mounted 
some incredible comebacks this 
season, but the Chippewas were 
too much to overcome.

Saturday 
marked 
the 
end 

of an up and down season for 
the Wolverines. They were a 
competitive team in the Big Ten 
and hovered around the top 25 all 
year. However, down the stretch, 

they looked like a different unit. 
The lineup, aside from Flores and 
Burton, was suspect. The team’s 
three runs in two tournament 
games emphasize those struggles.

“The expectation is to make a 

run in the postseason,” Bakich 
said. “We were not just happy to 
be here. We fully expected to win 
this regional. The end result is a 
failure, but it would be foolish of 
me to say the whole season was a 
failure.”

The 2021 team was unlike 

any other. Due to a nice blend of 
experienced veterans, talented 
underclassmen, and savvy fifty-
year transfers, Michigan finished 
with an impressive 27-19 record. 
They may not have finished the 
way they wanted, but Bakich has 
firm control over the program and 
they continue to trend upward.

After nearly hoisting the trophy 

in 2019, Bakich has remained 
obsessed with winning it all.

“There’s a feeling of emptiness 

because you know what you’re 
missing,” Bakich said. “It drives 
you to work even harder.”
