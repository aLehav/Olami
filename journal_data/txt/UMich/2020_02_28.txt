Amid 
concerns 
about 
health 
with 
the 
rise 
of 
COVID-19, also known as 
the coronavirus, University 
of Michigan students have 
altered 
travel 
plans 
for 
spring break.
Preeti Malani, University 
chief health officer; Lindsey 
Mortenson, medical director 
of University Health Service; 
and Robert D. Ernst, executive 
director of University Health 
Service, sent an email to 
University 
students 
and 
faculty Thursday morning 
noting 
the 
University 
has 
expanded 
its 
travel 
restrictions to South Korea, 
moving 
beyond 
previous 
warnings regarding China. 
The additional restrictions 
align the University with 
guidance from the Center for 
Disease Control.
“Consistent 
with 
travel 
warnings from the Centers 
for 
Disease 
Control 
and 
Prevention, the University 
of Michigan has expanded 
its travel restrictions beyond 
China 
to 
include 
South 
Korea,” the email stated. 
“All U-M related travel to 
these countries, including 

for faculty and staff, is 
discouraged. Personal travel 
to these countries also is 
discouraged.”
According to the email, all 
University-related travel to 
China and South Korea are 
discouraged, and international 
travelers are encouraged to 
build flexibility into their 
plans. However, while current 
travel within the United States 
is not restricted, the email 
does suggest precautionary 
measures.
As of Thursday, there are 
no confirmed cases of the 
virus in Michigan. However, 
according to the CDC, there 
are more than a dozen in 
the 
United 
States. 
The 
University will continue to 
monitor the situation along 
with health officials at the 
local, 
state 
and 
national 
levels to monitor the spread 
of the virus, the email said.
There are currently 400 
cases of COVID-19 in Italy 
as of Feb. 26. So far, 11 towns 
have 
been 
quarantined 
and 
numerous 
schools, 
universities and public events 
have been canceled due to 
fears related to the virus.

“I spoke up by letter in July 
of 1975 and it was ignored and 
denigrated by the University 
of Michigan,” said Tad Deluca, 
former University of Michigan 
wrestler. “I spoke up again by 
letter in 2018 after hearing 
an NPR story about the MSU 
gymnasts, women who I am 
in awe of. Once again, the 
University of Michigan ignored 
me. I’m here today to speak up 
again to let the University of 
Michigan know that I will not 
be ignored again.”

Deluca, who alleged the late 
Dr. Robert Anderson of sexual 
misconduct, along with other 
alleged 
survivors 
Thomas 
Evashevski, former University 
wrestler, and Andy Hrovat, 
Olympic wrestler and U-M 
alum, spoke publicly for the 
first time at a press conference 
in 
Southfield 
Thursday 
morning. 
Deluca submitted a letter 
in 1975 accusing Anderson of 
sexual abuse when he was a 
University student from 1972-
1976. The late Don Canham 
was the athletic director at 
the time. 

In 2018, Deluca submitted 
another 
letter 
with 
the 
same allegations to current 
University athletic director 
Warde Manuel. 
Parker 
Stinar, 
a 
lawyer 
with 
Wahlberg, 
Woodruff, 
Nimmo and Stone, facilitated 
the conference. He described 
Deluca’s 
experience 
with 
Anderson and the University. 
“Tad was also a victim of 
sexual abuse,” Stinar said. 
“From his freshman year to 
junior 
year, 
Dr. 
Anderson 
performed 
unnecessary 
examinations 
on 
Tad, 
including testicle and rectal 

examinations. 
Tad 
knew 
what 
Dr. 
Anderson 
was 
doing was wrong. And as a 
19-year-old, he wrote a letter 
to the individuals who are 
responsible 
for 
protecting 
him when he was away from 
his parents — his coach, Bill 
Johannesen … included in his 
letter, Tad has statements such 
as ‘Doctor drop your drawers 
Anderson’ and ‘something is 
wrong with Doctor Anderson. 
Regardless of what you go in 
there for, he always makes you 
drop your drawers.”’

As the Michigan Democratic 
primary approaches, student 
campaign 
organizations 
are 
working to spread the word 
about their candidate before 
the election on March 10. These 
efforts rely on members of those 
organizations tabling and phone 
banking to reach voters both 
on campus and in the greater 
Washtenaw County area.
The University of Michigan’s 
chapter of College Democrats 
has hosted some debate watch 
parties, which were attended by 
members of multiple politically 

affiliated student organizations. 
While College Democrats does 
not endorse primary candidates, 
four other political groups — 
Students for Bernie, Students 
for Biden, Students for Pete 
and Students for Warren — are 
working to elect their preferred 
candidates. 
According to LSA freshman 
Andrew 
Schaeffler, 
who 
is 
co-founder 
and 
campus 
organizer for Students for Biden, 
the group is focused on reaching 
out to Michigan voters as the 
primary approaches, especially 
those with absentee ballots. 
Schaeffler said he started 
the group in October 2019 
when he saw there was no 

student organization for Biden 
at the University.
“In general, I think a lot of 
people are like, ‘Oh, (Biden) is 
a member of the establishment. 
What has he actually done?’” 
Schaeffler 
said. 
“That’s 
been pretty much the main 
conversation that we’ve had 
with students.”
Schaeffler 
said 
Students 
for Biden has been working 
with both the national and 
state campaigns to expand its 
voter reach. He felt the group’s 
outreach efforts had a generally 
positive response from students.
“It’s no secret that Joe Biden 
isn’t the most liked candidate 
among 
students,” 
Schaeffler 

said. “But I do think that given 
that, we’ve had a very good 
response among students. When 
they leave, we’ve had people that 
have been like ‘You know what, I 
don’t agree with you, but at least 
now I understand your point.’”
Though both supporters of 
Biden, LSA freshmen Adam 
Grimes and Kenny Larson 
joined Students for Biden for 
different reasons. Grimes said 
he felt personally connected to 
the senator because of his own 
involvement in Philadelphia 
politics, which he said Biden 
influenced when he was a 
senator of nearby Delaware.

Seventy University of Michigan 
students and Ann Arbor residents 
gathered in the Regency Ballroom 
at the Graduate Ann Arbor hotel 
on Thursday evening for an event 
titled “Home Is Where the Heart 
Is.” Hosted by SAPAC’s Consent, 
Outreach & Relationship Education 
program and sponsored by Multi-
Ethnic Student Affairs and Central 
Student Government, the event 
was intended to encourage love and 
healthy relationships. 
The event featured performance 
duo Nia & Ness, a couple based in 
Rosendale, N.Y., performing their 
piece “home.” Through their work 
in poetry and dance, they address 
themes such as trauma, self-harm, 
self-love, healing and happiness. 
The pair has toured nationwide 
and received multiple honors for 
their work. 
The opening piece of the 
program delved into the problems 
within the world of Black lesbians, 
from within the Black community 
and from the outside. Ness’s 
poetry, paired with Nia’s sharp and 
striking dance told a story of all the 
people who have either sexualized, 
threatened or became aggressively 
jealous toward the couple. 

With the Michigan primary 
coming up March 10, University 
of 
Michigan 
administrative 
initiatives and student groups are 
spearheading efforts to mobilize 
student 
voters 
and 
increase 
turnout. 
One 
of 
the 
larger-scale 
initiatives is the Big Ten Voting 
Challenge, a nonpartisan coalition 
among the Big Ten Conference 
schools. 
The 
challenge 
was 
launched at the University in 2017 
through the Edward Ginsberg 
Center and recorded an average 
24 percent increase in the turnout 
rate among Big Ten schools from 
the 2014 to 2018 midterms. The 
University showed a 27 percent 
increase, nearly tripling voter 
turnout. 
According to Erin Byrnes, Lead 
of Democratic Engagement at the 
Ginsberg Center, this growth can 
be attributed to a combination 
of a strong digital and physical 
presence on campus. The challenge 
also 
works 
with 
nonpartisan 
student group Turn up Turnout to 
execute voter registration events, 
use social media for outreach and 
be physically present at the polls 
on voting day.

When 
University 
Provost 
Martin A. Philbert was placed 
on administrative leave on Jan. 
21 following allegations of sexual 
misconduct, the University hired 
WilmerHale, a law firm based in 
Washington, D.C., to investigate the 
claims against him.
According 
to 
a 
letter 
of 
engagement 
contracting 
WilmerHale, 
obtained 
through 
a Freedom of Information Act 
request, no attorneys at the firm 
who have previously represented 
the University will be working on 
this investigation. In addition, the 
contract explicitly states the firm is 
not contracted to defend Philbert 
or the University should any 
individual pursue a lawsuit against 
the University. 
“Our 
acceptance 
of 
this 
engagement 
does 
not 
involve 
an undertaking to represent the 
University or its interests in any 
other matter,” the letter reads. “Our 
Firm will not undertake any new 
matters for the University during 
this engagement, nor will our Firm 
undertake any matters involving 
the defense of any potential claims 
that are related to the allegations 
about Dr. Philbert.”
The letter notes the firm will 
support the University in regard to 
legal advice. 
WilmerHale is the resulting 
firm of a merger between Boston-
based law firm Hale and Dorr 
and the Washington, D.C.,-based 
firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering. 
Several individuals at the firm have 
prior experience in government, 
including former FBI Director 
Robert Mueller. While WilmerHale 
has 
represented 
corporations 
across the globe, the firm has 
often provided legal support to 
institutions of higher education, 
representing 
colleges 
and 
universities in lawsuits, providing 
legal advice and counseling and, as 

in the current case with the provost, 
serving as an external investigator 
for internal concerns at colleges or 
universities. 
Partners at WilmerHale involved 
in the investigation did not respond 
to the Daily’s request for comment 
in time for publication.
David Moran, clinical professor 
of law at Michigan Law School, said 
WilmerHale is considered one of 
the most prestigious, well-respected 
law firms in the country and 
graduates at Michigan Law School 
often hope to work there. Moran 
explained why the University would 
choose to hire an external firm to 
investigate the allegations against 
Philbert. 
“The last thing you want to do 
if you have (an) investigation of a 
very high ranking member of the 
administration is to conduct an 
internal investigation that runs the 
risk of being called a whitewash,” 
Moran said. “Anytime you have a 
large organization investigating 
itself, you are likely at the end of 
the day to have detractors of the 
investigation who will say, ‘Well, the 
powerful people being investigated 
prevented a real full investigation,’ 
so if you want to convince people 
that you’re doing a real independent 
investigation, you need to get an 
outside counsel.”
WilmerHale’s 
predecessor 
Wilmer 
Cutler 
Pickering 
has 
worked with the University of 
Michigan in the past. In the 
landmark U.S. Supreme Court 
cases Gratz v. Bollinger (2003) and 
Grutter v. Bollinger (2003), Wilmer 
Cutler Pickering defended the 
University against two students 
who filed suit after they were 
denied admission to LSA and the 
Law School. The students alleged 
they weren’t accepted because the 
University’s 
admissions 
policies 
favored applicants from certain 
minority groups. The Supreme 
Court 
ultimately 
upheld 
the 
consideration of race as a factor in 
the college admissions process.

WilmerHale has also defended 
Harvard 
University 
in 
an 
affirmative action case, in which 
students denied admission to the 
school argued the consideration 
of race in Harvard’s admissions 
policies 
hurt 
Asian 
American 
applicants. 
The firm also has experience 
representing institutions of higher 
education in situations involving 
controversial allegations of sexual 
assault levied against students. 
WilmerHale touts its work on 
the matter on its website, writing 
that 
following 
the 
“improper 
indictment” of members of Duke 
University’s 
lacrosse 
team 
in 
2006, the firm was responsible for 
“conducting an internal review for 
the board and helping the University 
address follow-on civil litigation.”
Shortly after a student at North 
Carolina Central University accused 
three 
Duke 
University 
men’s 
lacrosse players of raping her at a 
party in 2006, prosecutor and former 
Durham County District Attorney 
Michael Nifong, who was pursuing 
the case against the lacrosse players, 
resigned and was disbarred for 
violating 
rules 
of 
professional 
conduct 
and 
deliberately 
withholding information. Partners 
at WilmerHale then joined Duke’s 
defense team and helped the school 
reach a settlement with the students. 
The partners left the case in 2011 to 
allow local legal firms to take charge 
of the defense.
Beyond representing institutions 
of higher education in lawsuits, 
the University previously worked 
with WilmerHale on a patent 
matter in 2014 and 2015, according 
to 
University 
spokesman 
Rick 
Fitzgerald. 
“Attorneys 
in 
WilmerHale’s 
office in Boston helped U-M on a 
patent matter, from May 2014 to 
October 2015,” Fitzgerald wrote in a 
statement to the Daily.
An October 2018 panel titled 
“How to navigate a Me Too 
investigation” at the fifth annual 

Global 
Investigations 
Review 
provides a look at the approach 
WilmerHale 
may 
follow 
in 
investigating Philbert. WilmerHale 
partner Brenda Lee discussed the 
ideal time for an institution to begin 
an external investigation as well 
as the importance of remaining 
neutral during the process.
“When we are hired to conduct 
a factual investigation, our work is 
impartial,” Lee said. “That’s true 
across all types of investigations 
but is especially important when 
dealing with such a sensitive topic 
like sexual misconduct — you have 
to see where the facts take you.” 
University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel released a statement on 
Tuesday to update students and 
faculty on the work the University is 
doing in response to the allegations 
against Philbert and allegations 
of sexual misconduct against the 
late Robert Anderson, former 
team physician of the University of 
Michigan. 
Schlissel 
emphasized 
the 
University is working to support 
those who have been affected 
by 
offering 
free 
counseling 
services and encouraging anyone 
with additional information or 
perspectives to come forward and 
report them on a hotline. According 
to the statement, the University will 
also be working with an external 
firm to investigate the allegations 
against Anderson. 
“First, through an independent, 
external 
investigation 
team, 
the university will conduct an 
unflinching review of the facts – 
wherever they may lead – and will 
then provide to the public a full 
accounting of the harms caused to 
former patients by Anderson as well 
as any institutional failings that 
allowed him to keep practicing,” 
Schlissel 
wrote. 
“We 
promise 
to fully respect the privacy and 
confidentiality of witnesses as we 
do this.”

B E HIND THE STORY

Every Friday, one Daily staffer will give a behind-the-scenes 
look at one of this week’s stories. This week, LSA freshman 
Julia Forrest on her story “VP Mike Pence holds rally in Troy 
ahead of Michigan Primary”: 

“I chose to cover this event because I’ve always been 
fascinated by campaign rallies and how politicians or those 
who are running for office speak to and interact with their 
supporters. It was interesting to see how the Vice President 
spoke to his and the President’s fan base as they hit the 
campaign trail for their re-election campaign. I also thought 
it was interesting to hear in-person the speaking tactics the 
Vice President uses to get his supporters excited and active in 
the rally. I also think it’s important to hear from our political 
leaders, no matter what party they’re from, and to hear 
supporters of those parties and understand why everyone 
supports the types of politics that they do.”

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
”In a world where we value free speech and we value 
diversity, I think I can disagree with the owner of a business but still 
do business with the business. So, I don’t think those things should 
enter into investment decisions at all... So, the student voice is 
important, but it doesn’t have a big input into the endowment.”

U-M President Mark Schlissel on letting political beliefs determine the University’s investment 
decisions during The Daily’s monthly interview this week.

Nia and Ness performed 
their stories of coming out, 
and how people reacted to 
their love. They expressed the 
anxiety of needing to come out 
to people time after time and 
the anger with which people 
responded.
“Everyone’s eyes seem to 
ask, ‘How dare you two Black 
women be happy?’” Ness said. 
“‘How dare you two Black 
women be happy on your own? 
How dare you two Black women 
be happy together? How dare 
you two Black women be happy 
without us?’”
The 
pair 
addressed 
the 
stereotypes pushed upon them 
due to their race. Ness spoke of 
how their bodies came with a 

price, and they were paying the 
price every day. She expressed 
how every moment alive is 
spent fighting, not only against 
stereotypes but also against 
traumas, 
whether 
personal, 
ancestral or cultural. 
“We see our ancestors,” Ness 
said. “We close our eyes and 
we hear them speak. They tell 
us not much has changed since 
they were in chains. We feel the 
tension, the pain in our bodies 
weighing us down the way they 
were weighed down.”
Ness 
spoke 
about 
the 
oversexualization of young 
Black girls. She explained to 
the group that Black girls are 
viewed by society as sexually 
available, regardless of age. 
Younger girls are being made 
to act as though they are 
twice their age because this 
is the way the world sees 

them, Ness said.
“She’s still here in her body, 
a body becoming increasingly 
desired, but only if covered in 
white skin,” Ness said. “She’s 
worn the same outfit as a white 
woman with the same build 
and been told to take it off 
because it’s too sexy on her. 
But the white woman? She was 
praised.”
Mid-performance, 
Ness 
held the floor to herself and 
expressed 
how 
much 
she 
wanted to be happy and how 
difficult this can be. She spoke 
of how much of a challenge 
this was for her after she had 
come out. She said she had 
learned to keep joy in and not 
to express it, which caused her 
great pain. 

“In 2018, we hosted parties 
at the polls on Central and 
North Campus, and that was 
an opportunity for students 
to really engage with us, get 
some food, get some swag, 
have conversation and get 
some information around what 
they would be voting on if they 
weren’t yet fully informed to 
that end,” Byrnes said. 
“This 
year, 
for 
the 
presidential 
primary 
on 
March 10, with changes in 
our state voting laws with 
Proposal 3, we’ll be able to not 
only give student information 
on who and what will be on 
the ballot — of course in a way 
that’s non-partisan — but we’ll 
also be able to direct them to 
the city clerk’s office if they 
haven’t yet registered because 
they will be able to register in 
person up to and on the day 
that they’ll be voting.”
Byrnes 
highlighted 
the 
the support from President 
Mark Schlissel’s office, which 
streamlines her team’s work 
through the Office of New 
Student Programs. 
“It’s opened a lot of doors for 
us, which has been wonderful, 
so I think that’s an important 

piece of our reach,” Byrnes 
said. “It’s really empowered 
and enabled us to work directly 
with the Office of New Student 
Programs, talking with new 
and transfer students in the 
summer months as they’re 
first coming in the campus, 
really focusing on kind of 
weaving voting and broader 
democratic engagement to the 
student experience from day 
one.” 
Organizations 
such 
as 
WeListen, 
a 
student-run 
group that brings together 
voices from various political 
backgrounds on campus, have 
promoted discussion on a wide 
variety of topics and political 
engagement 
to 
encourage 
informed voting. 
According to LSA junior 
Caroline Martin, WeListen’s 
vice president of outreach, 
the 
organization 
tries 
to 
facilitate real conversations 
in 
a 
politically 
divided 
environment. 
Martin 
said 
a part of this process is 
educating students on political 
issues and emphasizing the 
importance of voting as a civic 
duty. 
“No matter where you fall 
on the political spectrum, 
voting is a privilege, a right, 
civic duty, fundamental pillar 
of democracy,” Martin said. 

“WeListen 
is 
adamant 
to 
provide neutral resources that 
allow you to make actionable, 
informed decisions.”
At the Law School, Michigan 
Voting 
Project, 
a 
student-
led organization previously 
known 
as 
the 
Michigan 
Election Law Project, brings 
together law students studying 
voting law and professors to 
engage the student body. 
Casey Wright, Law School 
student and Voter Registration 
Chair, said the group used to 
be focused solely on bringing 
law 
students 
opportunities 
to learn about voting law, but 
has evolved to include more 
groundwork and encourage 
volunteer opportunities and 
organizing at the polls. 
“Some people come into 
this with a lot of personal 
knowledge and background 
about election law, and what 
current voting rights efforts 
look like across the country,” 
Wright said. “Some people, 
like me, are just interested 
in 
voting 
rights 
and 
are 
passionate about it and want 
to learn about it. I don’t come 
from any formal voting-related 
background, but it’s really 
cool to see what other people 
are doing, and the professors 
from the Law School are really 
experts in this field.”

Wright 
said 
while 
law 
students usually have already 
had experience with voting, 
MVP 
helps 
students 
who 
might want to switch their 
registration 
to 
Michigan 
or help them get access to 
absentee ballots. 
“We want to make sure that 
people know that they can 
switch their registration to 
Michigan if they want to, so 
that’s been a big priority for 
us especially since Michigan 
is a swing state and its 
very important in national 
elections,” Wright said. “There 
are a lot of very important 
local ballot initiatives that 
affect students and graduate 
students, so we want to make 
sure that people know that 
they can register to vote in 
Michigan while they’re here 
at school.”
Wright said MVP has been 
facilitating voter registration 
at the Law School and making 
sure people know when the 
election will take place in 
preparation for the primary. 
Looking ahead to the general 
election, Wright said they are 
working with the Office of 
Student Life to help students 
avoid 
having 
to 
choose 
between classes and voting. 
“Missing 
class 
for 
law 
students can be especially 

challenging,” 
Wright 
said. 
“We’re 
working 
with 
our 
Office of Student Life to see 
what sorts of options we have 
in terms of getting our classes 
recorded 
and 
just 
making 
sure that even if people have 
a really packed class schedule 
on Tuesdays, that they will 
not have to sacrifice their 
ability to get to the poll before 
it closes.”
LSA freshman Nick Schuler, 
College Republicans freshman 
chair, 
said 
registration 
efforts have begun within 
the organization. He noted an 
event the group held last week, 
during which a representative 
from 
the 
Trump 
Victory 
Organization came to help 
members get registered. The 
critical work, however, will 
begin next year in preparation 
for the general election, he 
said. 
“Next year we’re certainly 
going to be ramping up our 
voter registration and get out 
the voter efforts,” Schuler said. 
“We’re doing that through the 
statewide Republican National 
Committee — they help us out a 
lot — and as well the statewide 
campus Republicans. We’re 
just looking to get Republicans 
registered, especially in a state 
like Michigan.”
Schuler said he believes 

student Republican turnout 
will be even greater than in 
2016 because of the political 
environment 
surrounding 
impeachment.
“I 
think 
that 
among 
Republicans 
the 
turn 
out 
is going to be higher due to 
impeachment and Republicans 
know that it was an unfair, 
purely partisan process,” he 
said. “Republicans are going 
to be fired up, and they’re 
going to want to send a 
message to Nancy Pelosi and 
the Democrats that what they 
did was wrong.”
LSA student Rose Sickrey 
has just registered to vote in 
Ann Arbor and plans to cast 
her ballot for Sen. Bernie 
Sanders, I-Vt.
“I’m voting for him because 
of 
his 
feminist 
stances, 
universal 
health 
care 
and 
taxing the ultra-wealthy as 
proportionately as us normal 
people are taxed. The fact 
that I paid more in federal 
taxes last year than Amazon 
is gross,” Sickery said. “I will 
be voting for Bernie Sanders 
because the U.S., even if 
kicking and screaming, needs 
to be dragged into the 21st 
century.”

In light of the coronavirus 
outbreak, some students at the 
University 
have 
rescheduled 
or 
altered 
their 
trips. 
LSA 
sophomore Charlotte Falk was 
planning to travel to Milan for 
part of her spring break. One 
person on the trip with Falk was 
traveling with her grandmother 
and originally changed her plans 
because of the heightened risk 
for older people. However, Falk 
said their entire friend group 
ultimately decided to cut Milan 
from their itinerary. 
“Initially 
she 
made 
that 
decision 
because 
she 
was 
traveling with her grandma, and 
since coronavirus affects older 
people more, it was definitely 
more of a health risk, but the 

rest of us were still planning on 
going,” Falk said. “Literally, day-
to-day, as the stories increased, 
we decided it was in our best 
interest not to go, not only for 
safety concerns but at a certain 
point, it came down to a city that 
was only half-functioning.” 
Falk said they only decided 
to 
cancel 
their 
Milan 
trip 
on Tuesday, and have been 
scrambling to plan a new trip 
to Lisbon, Portugal, over the 
last two days. She said she was 
frustrated by the cost burden of 
having to plan a new trip. She 
didn’t have flight insurance to 
cover the expense, and flight 
prices increased as it got closer 
to their planned vacation date.
“Everything’s been a really 
quick turnover,” Falk said. “It’s 
super 
frustrating, 
especially 
wanting to visit friends that 
were already studying abroad 

there, but their entire plans are 
rocked anyway too. I feel like 
we’re all scampering at the last 
minute.”
LSA junior Aashika Shetty, 
who is currently studying abroad 
in London, said she originally 
had plans to travel to Milan. 
However, Shetty and her friends 
have all decided to cancel their 
trip because of the health risks. 
Shetty also said people she 
knows currently studying in 
Milan have had school canceled 
indefinitely due to the outbreak.
“We all made the decision that 
it’s probably just safer not to go,” 
Shetty said. “For me, it’s not a big 
cost to have a flight from London 
to Milan, so I’m not losing that 
much money. It’s better to not go 
than go, and I think it was also 
for peace of mind, too.”

Meanwhile, Larson started this 
election cycle as a Pete Buttigieg 
supporter, 
then 
switched 
his 
support to Biden.
“I still like Pete Buttigieg as a 
candidate,” Larson said. “But the 
reason that Joe Biden specifically 
appealed to me (was through) 
having 
conversations 
with 
Andrew … and other members of 
the Biden organization, getting to 
know them and really digging into 
the policies.”
While all the groups hope to 
get voters for their respective 
candidate, their target audience 
varies. According to Schaeffler, 
Students for Biden focuses on 
students, helping them navigate 
absentee voting and encouraging 
civil engagement. 
On the other hand, according 
to LSA freshman Sonya Love, 
a 
field 
captain 
for 
Students 
for Warren last semester, her 
organization works closely with 
Washtenaw for Warren, which 

focuses on residents across the 
county. Students for Warren is 
also directly affiliated with the 
national Warren campaign.

Love said she worked to create 
plans for various field events. She 
said she has been a supporter of 
Warren since the beginning of 
summer 2019.
“I’m just really drawn to her 
message,” Love said. “I really am 
inspired by the positive change 
that I think she would bring to this 
country as president. It’s also just 
cool to meet like-minded people.”
Love 
said 
she 
has 
been 
attending Students for Warren 
meetings since the group first 
formed and has also participated 
in phone banking sessions.
“It’s 
palpable 
how 
excited 
people are about Warren as a 
candidate,” Love said. “They’re 
excited to make change in every 
way they can.”
Students for Bernie is a student 
organization 
affiliated 
with 
the 
national 
Bernie 
Sanders 
campaign, which recently opened 
a campaign office in Ann Arbor. 
The 
national 
campaign 
has 

provided resources, including two 
paid staffers and weekly call-in 
checks to help guide the group. 
LSA 
sophomore 
Anna 
Nedoss, 
Students 
for 
Bernie 
organization chair, told The Daily 
the national Sanders campaign 
putting resources into student 
organizations demonstrates an 
investment in college voters.
“The support that we get from 
the campaign is super valuable,” 
Nedoss said. “They help us do a lot 
of ‘get out the vote’ initiatives, so 
we actually are working directly 
with people who are paid by 
the campaign to come help us. 
That’s how much the campaign 
is really emphasizing student 
voter turnout and just the student 
demographic.”
LSA freshman Porter Hughes, 
co-founding 
member 
and 
communications 
director 
of 
Students for Bernie, said he works 
to spread the word about the 
senator through social media in 
addition to the tabling and phone 
banking events. Hughes said he 
went through training over the 
summer with the national Sanders 

campaign to prepare to lead 
Students for Bernie.
“Over the summer, they taught 
us a lot about how to organize on 
campus, things of that nature,” 
Hughes said. “And then we also 
brought in other groups or other 
people from our group to help join 
the leadership team and just like 
our general membership.” 
Hughes emphasized his support 
for Sanders, saying his policies 
will allow everyone to have equal 
opportunities for success. 
“We really believe in Senator 
Sanders’s mission: to transform 
our 
country, 
transform 
our 
politics to something that makes it 
possible for everybody to have the 
same opportunities,” Hughes said. 
“This is the kind of world that we 
need to live in and Sanders fulfills 
that vision and we are very happy 
to assist him.”
Students for Pete was founded 
by LSA senior Jessica Kosticak to 
bring together U-M students who 
support Buttigieg for president. 
Business freshman Jay Rubin 
said he found out about Students 
for Pete at the beginning of the 

year. Rubin said he is supporting 
Buttigieg because he believes 
Buttigieg is the most electable and 
the candidate best suited to beat 
President Donald Trump.
“When you look at the other 
candidates, I believe Pete is the 
best candidate because Sanders 
and Warren are way too far left 
and aren’t electable candidates,” 
Rubin said. “Klobuchar does not 
have enough support, Biden is too 
old and Bloomberg just entered 
the race too late. Combined with 
Pete’s well-spoken tendency and 
the fact that he’ll bring stability 
to the White House that we lack 
during the Trump presidency, I 
also believe he is the best candidate 
and he has a proven track record 
of success with being the mayor of 
South Bend, Indiana.”
Rubin also said he thinks 
supporting Buttigieg on Super 
Tuesday is the next step to 
making sure he wins the Michigan 
Democratic primary.
“With Super Tuesday coming 
up, it’s definitely encouraged us to 
do our best to ensure that Pete does 
get a lot of votes and ultimately, 

hopefully, the nomination,” Rubin 
said. “We all believe in Students 
for Pete that Pete is the best 
candidate. While we respect every 
other candidate, we do believe 
that Pete has the best chance to 
win the White House back and 
the primaries are just one way to 
achieve that.”
Beyond 
political 
affiliations 
and hopes for their candidate, 
however, student organizers aim 
to get more people to the polls. 
Larson said one of his priorities is 
increasing political participation.
“Even more than just promoting 
Joe Biden, we want to make sure 
that students most importantly, 
are civically engaged, whether 
they be Biden supporters or Trump 
supporters or nonvoters,” Larson 
said. “I think it’s really important 
that we have people, whether they 
be on any side of the political 
aisle, supporting any candidate 
or no candidate, to be willing to 
have open conversations.”

Stinar 
explained 
Deluca 
trusted and looked up to 
Coach Bill Johannesen like a 
father and was disappointed 
in his response.
“How did the University 
of Michigan coach, father 
figure Johannesen respond?” 
Stinar questioned. “Tad was 
removed from the wrestling 
team, Tad’s scholarship and 
financial aid was revoked. 
Tad’s personal letter that he 
wrote in 1975 was read to the 
rest of his wrestling team.”
In 
a 
statement 
from 
University spokesman Rick 
Fitzgerald, the University has 
hired 
outside 
investigators 
Steptoe & Johnson to uncover 
the facts of the case. 
“The 
university 
engaged 
a firm with deep expertise 
to conduct an independent, 
thorough, 
and 
unflinching 
review of the facts – wherever 
they may lead,” the statement 
reads. “Through the work 

of 
this 
independent 
firm, 
there will be a full, public 
accounting 
of 
the 
harms 
caused by Anderson as well 
as the institutional failings 
that allowed him to keep 
practicing.” 
Stinar then described the 
letter Deluca sent in 2018 
to Athletic Director Warde 
Manuel. 
Stinar 
alleged 
Manuel ignored the letter. 
“Tad’s 2018 letter to the 
athletic 
director 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
includes very, very serious 
statements,” 
Stinar 
said. 
“After receiving this letter 
athletic 
director 
Warde 
Manuel and Pamela Heatlie, 
who is affiliated with the 
academic and faculty Affairs, 
sat on this letter for numerous 
months, because it got lost in 
a stack of paperwork. This 
letter was received in the heat 
of the Nassar investigation. 
The University of Michigan 
sat on this letter for months, 
and just like Tad’s 1975 letter, 
it was ignored.”
After 
Manuel 
received 

the 
letter 
in 
2018, 
the 
University police conducted 
an 
investigation 
into 
the 
allegations. 
However, 
the 
Washtenaw 
County 
Prosecutor’s office did not 
pursue 
criminal 
charges 
because Anderson had died in 
2008 . 
Hrovat 
described 
how 
his teammates warned him 
about Anderson before he 
had to go in for his physical 
as a freshman and the impact 
of knowing what was about 
to happen had on his mental 
state. 
“When your team is telling 
you when you go in there, that 
you’re going to be touched 
inappropriately, and things 
are gonna get weird,” Hrovat 
explained. “Just going into 
it, that mental psyche was 
something I couldn’t deal with 
at the time. You know, that’s 
what has stuck with me for 
the last 20-plus years, to have 
to go into a room knowing that 
you’re going to encounter this 
… and that’s why it’s always 
been in the back of my mind 

that this wasn’t right.”
Evashevski commented on 
the prevalence of the abuse 
perpetrated by Anderson.
“It happened to me, it 
happened to them, it happened 
to just about everyone I knew,” 
Evashevksi said. 

Hrovat 
described 
his 
experience as a male athlete 
who was sexually abused. 
He said the culture within 
athletics for males to push 
through any obstacles they 
face 
contributed 
to 
the 
environment of silence. 
“As athletes in combat sport, 
an individual sport, we’re 
taught our whole lives that, 
you know, this is on us, you 
know, be tough, push through 
it,” Hrovat said. “And make no 
excuses because everything’s 
in your hands...It’s really hard 
to look at yourself as a victim, 
right? Because you’re not a 
victim on the mat. It’s in your 
hands, right? But it’s hard to 
separate.”
Deluca said he often blamed 
himself for his losses on the 

mat, and that blame carried 
over to his interactions with 
Anderson. 
“If I won, it was my fault, 
if I lost, it was my fault,” 
Deluca said. “So, in 1975 I lost 
everything, and it was my 
fault.”
Stinar 
concluded 
by 
explaining the next steps the 
alleged survivors were taking 
legally. He noted a lawsuit 
has not yet been filed but they 
have a meeting scheduled 
with the general counsel of 
the University in the near 
future. 
“At this point, our three 
goals are to uncover the truth, 
and that will be through 
the documents that we’ve 
obtained, as well as speaking 
to other victims and other 
individuals willing to come 
forward and speak up,” Stinar 
said. “Number two is to allow 
a safe platform for victims 
to call into, to communicate, 
to share their story… and 
then number three is holding 
the University of Michigan 
accountable. 
And 
number 

three, 
there’s 
different 
pathways to go down. And at 
this time, the first step is to 
meet with the University.”
The University statement 
recognized the courage of the 
men who told their stories and 
requested others who have 
been negatively impacted by 
Anderson to come forward. 
“The 
three 
brave 
men 
who came forward today to 
share their stories delivered 
a 
powerful 
message,” 
the 
statement reads. “We want to 
encourage everyone harmed 
by Robert E. Anderson or 
who has evidence of his 
misconduct to come forward. 
At the University of Michigan 
we want to hear your voices.”
The 
allegations 
against 
Anderson 
come 
after 
the 
University 
placed 
Provost 
Martin 
Philbert 
on 
leave 
due to multiple allegations 
of sexual misconduct and 
allegations against University 
EECS Professor Jason Mars.

D

rinking, 
Greek 
life 
and one-night stands 
— when you think of 
college social life, these are 
probably the first things to 
come to mind. What you might 
not think about is how these 
quintessential undergraduate 
experiences work to exclude 
minority students. The fact 
is 
that 
college 
campuses 
create an environment that 
is inherently unhealthy for 
LGBTQ+ students.
It’s 
no 
secret 
college 
students drink — a lot. Four 
out of five students consume 
alcohol, and about half binge 
drink. With such a presence, 
it 
is 
difficult 
for 
at-risk 
students to avoid developing 
a 
dependency 
on 
alcohol. 
Many groups of people are at 
increased risk, of course, but 
perhaps the most predisposed 
group 
is 
the 
LGBTQ+ 
community. An estimated 25 
percent of LGBTQ+ people 
suffer 
from 
alcoholism, 
compared to 5 to 10 percent of 
the general population. While 
it’s no secret minorities are 
at higher risk for substance 
abuse, queer people have a 
unique social position that 
makes it harder for us to 
both avoid alcohol in the 
first place and to get treated 
for alcoholism after the fact. 
Before the mainstream gay 
rights movement, gay bars 
were the only place LGBTQ+ 
people could meet and be 
themselves, and to this day 
they 
are 
practically 
the 
only 
social 
establishments 
catering specifically to queer 
folks. Alcohol is central to 
the community’s social life. 
After dependency forms, it is 
harder for LGBTQ+ people to 
get help for their addictions 
as 
many 
lack 
supportive 
families. 
Furthermore, 
faith-based rehab programs 
are 
hardly 
a 
welcoming 
environment, whether they 
scare people away by their 
religious nature inherently or 
prevent LGBTQ+ attendance 
outright.
It is also nothing new that 
colleges have a problem with 
sexual misconduct. Anyone 
can be the victim of sexual 

assault 
and 
harassment, 
though we often see women as 
being most affected. However, 
this is another issue that 
profoundly impacts LGBTQ+ 
people, not just heterosexual 
women. 
Three 
in 
four 
LGBTQ+ 
college 
students 
reported experiencing sexual 
harassment, and trans and 
genderqueer 
students 
had 
the highest rates of rape 
(it is worth noting that one 
of the campuses surveyed 
for this data was Michigan 
State 
University, 
just 
an 
hour away from us). While 
this victimization is a result 
of bigotry not exclusive to 
campus life, colleges have 

become a vessel for this 
sexual mistreatment. Even 
consensual sexual behavior 
on campus is often harmful 
to 
LGBTQ+ 
students; 
college hookup culture is 
incredibly 
heteronormative 
and reliant on gender roles, 
making it difficult for people 
to 
participate 
without 
replicating 
these 
roles 
in 
what is essentially a form 
of censorship of queerness 
mandated by college society.
Greek life is perhaps the 
epitome of gender conformity 
on 
campus. 
Fraternities 
enforce 
hypermasculinity 
upon 
their 
members, 
creating 
an 
environment 
of, among other unsavory 
elements, misogyny, sexual 
assault, 
alcohol 
abuse 
and homophobia. Each of 
these facts either directly 
victimizes 
queer 
people, 
through 
aspects 
like 
misogyny and homophobia, 
or indirectly targets them 
because of disproportionate 
risks 
they 
face, 
such 
as 
through sexual assault or 

alcohol 
abuse. 
Sororities, 
while 
less 
notorious, 
are 
fundamentally 
linked 
to 
their male counterparts in 
upholding this standard by 
promoting hyper-femininity 
and 
placing 
it 
opposite 
masculinity. 
Both 
sides 
of the Greek life coin are 
predisposed to discriminate 
against 
gender 
non-
conforming people, whether 
gay, trans or simply presenting 
in a non-conforming manner. 
Once again, LGBTQ+ people 
are 
both 
implicitly 
and 
explicitly kept out of these 
institutions: 
implicitly 
by 
knowing that Greek life has 
no space for non-conforming 
individuals, and explicitly by 
nondiscrimination 
policies 
that ignore or ban gay and 
trans people.
All of this adds up to a hostile 
environment 
for 
LGBTQ+ 
people, and it has tangible 
effects 
on 
our 
education. 
One-fifth of all anti-LGBTQ+ 
harassment 
and 
violence 
occurs on college campuses, 
and 
the 
fear 
of 
physical 
safety this violence creates 
often leads to absenteeism, 
falling grades and increased 
chances of dropping out. In 
one survey, 33 percent of 
LGB and 38 percent of trans 
students seriously considered 
leaving their college because 
of how poor the campus 
climate was. LGBTQ+ high 
school students are less likely 
to intend to go to college the 
more harassment they face. 
As of 2015, the odds of a 
queer woman completing her 
bachelor’s degree were only 
one in four (the odds were 
double that for queer men, 
however). LGBTQ+ centers 
and inclusion orientations can 
only do so much for us when 
campus society is built in a 
way that inherently others 
LGBTQ+ students. Though it 
will be hard to dismantle such 
baked-in biases, I believe it is 
worth it, as success in college 
will pose us for success in 
making LGBTQ+ lives safer in 
the rest of the world.

n 
1848, 
Karl 
Marx 
— 
influential German political 
theorist — published the 
Communist 
Manifesto 
with 
co-author 
Friedrich 
Engels 
in the face of groundbreaking 
class struggle. The Manifesto, 
which outlined the system of 
communism in order to save 
the growing and increasingly 
impoverished 
working 
class, 
sought to close the dramatic gap 
between everyday proletarians 
and the exploitative bourgeoisie 
and make society work for all.
Almost two centuries later, 
Democratic 
presidential 
candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, 
I-Vt., 
a 
self-proclaimed 
“democratic socialist,” is quickly 
building a revolution resting on 
those same principles. In a once-
crowded field of candidates that 
has 
considerably 
narrowed, 
Sanders has emerged as the 
front-runner for the nomination, 
drawing considerable support 
from young people across the 
country who want a “tax on 
extreme wealth,” a Green New 
Deal, Medicare for All, student 
loan debt forgiveness and more.
Places like Ann Arbor with 
large 
student 
populations 
are ground zero for Sanders 
supporters. Young Democrats 
adore this political movement 
and might just propel the senator 
to 
become 
the 
Democratic 
standard-bearer. 
But there’s something really 
concerning 
happening 
with 
those who are “feeling the Bern.” 
Sanders 
supporters 
across 
this country might be strong 
in numbers and proud to cast 
their vote for the democratic 
socialist, but a politician with 
such radical ideas shouldn’t be 
polling at even half of where he 
stands right now. 
After spending months on 
one of the most politically active 
college campuses in the country, 
it’s become clear that Sanders’s rise 
to prominence is being fueled 
by young people’s growing 
disconnect to the true reality of 
American life. Millennials and 
Gen Zers desperately need to 
stop feeling the Bern and take 
the time to understand what 
has made America — a place 
where 
anybody 
can 
work 
their way up to success — the 
most respected country in the 
world.
Although Sanders and his 

supporters are determined to 
unite “around an agenda that 
works for all of us, and not 
just the billionaire class,” as 
the senator said at the recent 
Nevada Democratic debate, the 
problem is that the Sanders 
revolution 
is 
completely 
missing the point. America is 
already prospering, and not 
just for the billionaire class. 
People of all walks of life are 
thriving, whether Sanders’s 
most 
passionate 
supporters 
want to recognize that fact or 
not.
While 
Marx’s 
Manifesto 
resonated in a time when 
the 
proletariat 
faced 
unprecedented struggles, the 
Sanders movement really has 
no struggles to talk about, 
other 
than 
ones 
that 
are 
ultimately baseless. A recent 
Gallup poll released in the 
midst of Sanders’s surprising 
ascent found that 89 percent of 
Republicans feel they’re better 
off than they were three years 
ago. When aggregated with 29 
percent of Democrats, that’s 60 
percent of all Americans that 
feel they’re better off now. And 
this isn’t all. Gallup mentioned 
in another poll that 63 percent 
of Americans consider our 
economy 
to 
be 
“excellent” 
or “good,” while the pollster 
also indicated that 61 percent 
say the American economy is 
improving.
Do 
these 
figures 
seem 
to indicate a system where 
everybody but the billionaire 
class is suffering, as Sanders 
tells us? I don’t think so. In 
fact, 
ordinary 
people 
are 
going to work in near-record 
numbers and our economy is 
expanding at full speed. And 
this expansion has nothing to 
do with a stock market that has 
repeatedly hit record highs. 
It’s all about the major strides 
that everyday Americans are 
making all of the time.
Last September, the Bureau 
of Labor Statistics found that 
the unemployment rate of 3.5 
percent was at its lowest point 
since 1969 — 50 years ago at the 
time of the report. The Bureau 
recorded the rate to be close 
by, at 3.6 percent, as of early 
February.
Beyond 
this, 
figures 
reveal that the working class 
in 
particular 
(especially 

historically 
disadvantaged 
groups) has prospered beyond 
belief over the past decade. 
Since 2009, according to the 
Bureau, the bottom 10 percent 
of Americans have seen their 
earnings grow by almost 5 
percent, compared to only 3 
percent for the top tenth. By this 
measure, our country is actually 
seeing a decrease in inequality, 
simply as a result of market 
forces. Earnings growth for 
workers has also outpaced 
that of managers over the 
same period, while the same 
trend holds for people who 
don’t hold bachelor’s degrees 
compared to those who hold 
bachelor’s degrees or higher.
The truth, as harsh as 
it may be for those who are 
feeling the Bern, is that our 
nation is indisputably working 
not just for billionaires — it’s 
working for every American 
that has the will and ambition 
to carve out a successful life. 
Young people need to take 
the time to realize as soon 
as possible that a Sanders 
presidency would wreak havoc 
on everything that has made 
our country great already.
While 
Sanders 
has 
won 
some of the early battles, the 
war is far from over, with the 
critical Super Tuesday contests 
still 
looming 
ahead. 
Many 
Americans 
have 
convinced 
themselves 
that 
Sanders 
has a clear path toward the 
nomination and is essentially 
unstoppable, but at a time 
when America is doing better 
than ever, I have hope that a 
candidate who truly supports 
the core values of this nation 
will prevail.
The 
Democratic 
primary 
comes to Michigan on Tuesday, 
March 10. On that day, when 
millions across the country will 
be casting their ballots, I urge 
every voter to reject an agenda 
of democratic socialism that 
would completely reverse the 
progress millions of ordinary 
Americans are enjoying. In 
the end, Democrats have an 
uncompromising 
obligation 
to nominate a candidate that 
will build on, not dismantle, 
the profound success that has 
defined the United States.

How to make a large lecture hall accessible

Campus social life through queer eyes

A

s students at a huge public 
university, it’s easy to go 
through all four years 
at the University of 
Michigan 
unnoticed 
by 
professors. 
It’s 
possible to just attend 
the lecture, submit your 
assignments on Canvas, 
show up to exams 
and slide by without 
forming 
connections 
with University staff 
and faculty. 
For 
me, 
one 
of 
the 
most 
difficult 
transitions from high school to 
college was adapting to giant 
lecture halls. Introductory level 
courses in 1800 CHEM (the largest 
lecture hall in the Chemistry 
Building) filled with over 300 
students are a major change as 
my largest class in high school 
contained a maximum of 25 
students. In terms of learning, it 
didn’t impact me negatively; I’ve 
enjoyed the lecture slides format. 
But I faced the most trouble when 
it came to asking questions. In 
particular, 
women 
in 
large 
STEM courses and majors often 
discuss how difficult it is to feel 
comfortable asking questions. This 
includes questions related to either 
course content or general inquiry 
about professional development. 
It’s particularly intimidating to 
approach 
your 
distinguished 
professor and ask them questions 
about their career path, your 
trajectory and advice on entering a 
field in front of 300 students.
This is why office hours exist, to 
answer all questions ranging from 
course content to getting to know 
your professor on a professional 
level. However, most students 
tend to attend office hours the 
week before the exam, which is 
typically an opportunity to ask 
questions related to the upcoming 
exam. Then, assuming the office 
hours experience is useful for 
exam material, the typical student 
doesn’t visit the professor until 
the next office hours opportunity 

immediately before the next exam. 
“Students don’t come to office 
hours because they don’t think 
they are worthy of 
the professor’s time, 
or they have attended 
an office hour and the 
faculty member was 
not very welcoming,” 
says 
Katherine 
Merseth, 
a 
senior 
lecturer at Harvard.
It’s understandable 
that 
amid 
all 
the 
extracurricular 
activities, 
a 
full 
semester course load, job hours 
and other time commitments, 
it seems near impossible to add 
attending office hours to the “to-
do list.” However, to be able to 
find a mentor who you identify 
with, whether it be in terms of 
social identities, passions, life 
experiences or career interests, 
truly adds to the undergraduate 
experience. While professors and 
faculty members are just as busy 
as they appear to be with research 
and side projects, they chose to 
work at an academic institution 
like the University of Michigan 
because they look forward to 
interacting with the University’s 
high-achieving student population. 
Therefore, it’s essential to the 
University student experience to 
attend weekly office hours and 
engage with professors beyond the 
classroom to foster connections 
that support your professional and 
personal development. 
From 
the 
professor’s 
end, 
professors should work to be 
more approachable and to create 
an atmosphere that encourages 
students to attend office hours or 
make one-on-one appointments 
with their professors to talk about 
their research interests or side 
project ideas. Currently, office hours 
take the form of a Q&A session. To 
add a more conversational tone 
to the office hours experience, 
connect course material to real-
world applications in the field. In 
doing so, the office hour session 

transforms from a formal Q&A 
session into an open discussion on 
ways in which the material is useful 
to students pursuing careers related 
to the course or major. Additionally, 
today, office hours often take place 
in the confinements of the four 
white walls of the professor’s office. 
What scares students away from 
attending office hours are the tall 
bookcases and sitting before an 
accomplished professor with their 
large desk looming over the room. 
This is precisely what makes an 
online interface like Piazza seem 
like a more approachable forum 
for “dumb” or “basic” questions. In 
previous courses in which office 
hours appeared more accessible to 
me, professors booked conference 
rooms or neutral spaces like a table 
in the open common area to make 
students feel more comfortable with 
approaching the professor with any 
question. While professors often 
mention that students are welcome 
to stop by and say hello on the 
syllabus day of the lecture, it may be 
helpful to consistently mention that 
it is more than OK to attend office 
hours just to say hello and introduce 
yourself.
As students at the University, 
we’re privileged with so many 
resources accessible to us, and 
professors are one of them. The 
breadth of specialized knowledge 
each U-M faculty member holds is 
accompanied by life experiences 
and on-the-job learned skills. This 
is the benefit of human-to-human 
interactions: There’s a level of 
personal touch that an encyclopedia, 
YouTube video and Google search 
cannot provide. Professors are 
bursting with so much “insider” 
material to share, so find time in 
your four years to prioritize finding 
mentors and networking with 
experts in your field of interest. 
At the end of the day, these very 
same professors and faculty were 
also students trying to navigate the 
undergraduate experience.

For many people, the Olympics is a major highlight. 

Watching incredible feats of athleticism in unfamiliar 
locales is always a treat, and the 2018 Winter Olympics 
in PyeongChang was no exception. No matter the 
season, no matter the sport and no matter the country, 
the Games are a delight for people around the globe. 
That said, we can only ever view the Games through a 
television screen, thousands of miles away from the real 
action. This is part of what makes the film “Olympic 
Dreams” so enticing — it’s a 
chance to see the Olympics from 
a new point of view, a behind-
the-scenes look at the way the 
Olympics is run and the people 
who come to the Games with big 
dreams.

The film follows two main 

characters: 
Penelope 
(Alexi 

Pappas, “Tracktown”), a first-
time Olympic athlete competing 
in cross-country skiing, and 
Ezra (Nick Kroll, “Big Mouth”), 
a sociable dentist who takes the 
opportunity to volunteer at the 
Olympics. The two characters 
have very different experiences 
at the event: Penelope is plagued 
by the pressure to perform well in her competition, 
while Ezra enters the village joyful for the chance to 
even attend. 

While Penelope’s perspective as an athlete is a new 

and interesting story for the average audience, Ezra’s 
is one that we understand. The way his eyes light up as 
he takes in the sights of the Olympics is charming and 
relatable, the awe of seeing a new side of something 
that he finds great joy in. But despite their differences, 
they are drawn together by their titular dreams and a 
struggle to understand what they want in life moving 
forward, causing them to form a strong connection. 

Despite the somewhat cliché premise, “Olympic 

Dreams” is a very unique film for a number of reasons. 
For one, it was filmed in the PyeongChang Olympic 
Village during the 2018 games, depicting rooms and 

buildings that were actually being used for the Olympics 
during shooting. The reason this was possible is one of 
the other unique things about this film: Kroll, Pappas 
and director (and Pappas’s husband) Jeremy Teicher 
(“Tracktown”) were the only members of the cast and 
crew during shooting, though you would never guess 
that from watching. 

Another unique aspect is the sheer number of athletes 

in the film. Pappas, Olympian-turned-Hollywood 
actress, ran track for Greece in the 2016 Olympics in Rio 
and released a film that same year (“Tracktown,” which 
starred Pappas and was co-written by Pappas and 
Teicher). In addition to Pappas, several of Ezra’s patients 

were real Olympians in the 2018 
games. It also features Morgan 
Schild, a freestyle mogul skier 
for USA, as Penelope’s hallmate 
Maggie, and Gus Kenworthy, a 
freestyle skier, playing a version of 
himself that strikes up a delightful 
friendship with Penelope. 

But the main star of the film 

is 
the 
relationship 
between 

Penelope and Ezra, an emotional 
connection that formed so quickly 
and so intensely that they couldn’t 
explain what it was, but knew that 
they would never forget it. Pappas 
and Kroll are both effortlessly 
charming, conveying a warmth 
and bliss in each other’s company 

in every scene. Watching Penelope and Ezra run 
through the Olympic village, eat Korean barbeque and 
dance like no one’s watching, you get a sense that these 
are two people who are perfectly happy when they’re 
together. 

“Olympic Dreams” is a love letter to the Olympics, to 

the good and the bad of finally achieving your dreams 
and finding people in the chaos. For an hour and a half, 
you are transported to a snowy village in South Korea, 
where you get to watch two people find each other 
within the brief bubble of the games. Despite the cheesy 
title and premise, the film manages to weave a story that 
is a perfect middle between stiff and cheesy, a sweetness 
that is injected in every line and interaction in such a 
way that you walk out with a smile on your face and a 
warm feeling in your heart.

‘Olympic Dreams’ is a 
warm hug on a winter night

FILM REVIEW

KARI ANDERSON

Daily Arts Writer

Walking out of Ford Field Saturday night, I 

felt like I had made a mistake. My ears buzzed 
with the sound of a record-breaking 70,000 
strong audience sing-along. My mind raced to 
try and capture the memory of what I had just 
seen — a 58 year old Garth Brooks sprinting 
back-and-forth across a circular stage, and then 
lots of subsequent panting. My throat hurt, of 
course, from all the cheering. In the back of my 
mind however, I couldn’t help but feel foolish. 
Or even worse, mean. 

When I saw that Luke Combs was coming 

to Grand Rapids and Garth Brooks was 
playing in Detroit on back-to-back weekends, 
I immediately decided that I had to attend and 
compare the experiences. Combs and Brooks 

outline the ideal trajectory of a career in country 
music — Combs’s stardom is rising and Brooks 
is a bonafide legend. The opportunity to see 
both ends felt unmissable. However, I should 
have known that trying to compare anyone to a 
seven-time CMA Entertainer of the Year meant 
setting up the other artist for failure. 

Still, as my starstruck daze starts to fade, I 

can see where my head was at: Combs has been 
heralded as the second-coming of neotraditional 

country — the ’90s sound that Garth is the King 
of. Combs’s latest album beat Brooks’s Hot 
Country Chart record for the most entries in 
a single week. The most explicit link between 
the two artists was drawn by Combs himself: 
During his concert, he covered one of Brooks’s 

signature songs “The Dance.” The potential for 
Combs to become the next-generation Garth 
Brooks is clear — once one is able to reconcile 
their age differences. 

Take, for example, the shows’ energetic 

highpoints. In the middle of “1, 2 Many,” one 
of Combs’s uptempo drinking songs, a crew 
member rushed a can of beer to the middle of 
the stage. There was a pause in the music as the 
crowd unraveled what was happening. When it 
clicked that, yes, he really was about to shotgun 
a beer on stage, the audience erupted.

During “Ain’t Goin’ Down (til’ the Sun Comes 

Up),” Brooks didn’t reach for a beer, but two 
uncapped water bottles. Instead of downing 
them (which seemed warranted given all of his 
running around), he splashed them around the 
stage, into the audience, and finally poured out 
two more onto a drum set. 

Whereas Brooks’s crowd interaction involved 

trading cowboy hats with a young fan for a few 
verses, Combs later refilled the contents of one 
audience member’s raised red solo cup with his 
own as he was singing.

While 
these 
approaches 
to 
audience 

engagement feel comical in comparison, both 
artists’ enthusiasm, and more importantly, 
skill for connecting with their fans, is obvious. 

Brooks showcased his ability to read the room 
when, after a sequence of fast songs, he decided 
to scrap the upcoming slow song on the setlist 
and keep the high energy going. Combs also 
demonstrated his ability to manage an audience. 
Even though he has two incredibly popular 
albums out, Combs held the crowd in the palm 
of his hand while playing an unreleased song 
called “Without You” acoustically. 

I chalk this power up to Brooks and Combs 

having what I hesitantly call “dad energy.” Not 
because they have kids (Combs doesn’t), but 
because they care in a way that feels uniquely 
genuine. Brooks was all waves, hand-hearts 
and “Happy Birthdays!” during his show. He 
repeatedly expressed his gratitude, staring 
starry-eyed into the stands and opening his 
arms wide, as if he was embracing everyone. 

Combs is less direct at showing his love, but 

just as emotional in his songs. “Refrigerator 
Door” and “Even Though I’m Leaving” were 

both sweet moments at his show that highlight 
Combs’s knack for appreciating life’s little 
things. “Dad energy” is about warmth. Lots 
of country artists are good at conveying joy 
or heartbreak, but it’s much harder to make a 
crowd feel safe in the way Garth and Luke can.

Most of Garth’s encore consisted of just him 

and his guitar. He took song requests from the 
signs his more-seasoned fans knew to bring, 
and he made a request of his own by deciding 
to cover “Piano Man.” This, I think, is the 
mark of a legend. The ability to rely exclusively 
on your discography and yourself to pull off 
entertaining a stadium of people. Combs hasn’t 
had the time to get there yet, but even Brooks 
himself thinks that he will get there eventually. 
After winning his latest Entertainer of the 
Year Award in 2019, Garth predicted that Luke 
would grow to become Entertainer of the Year 
eight times — breaking another one of Garth’s 
records. 

Two concerts, two weeks: Luke Combs and Garth Brooks

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW

‘Lord of the Flies’ rendition 
is disturbingly brilliant

As most public school kids in America will 

remember from their ninth grade English class, 
“The Lord of the Flies” by William Goldingis 
is the quintessential dystopian novel of our 
childhood. While I was never fully convinced 
by the 1940’s classic that humans in general, 
let alone 12 year old boys could collapse into 
madness so easily, the University department 
of Theatre and Drama performance may have 
convinced me otherwise.

Music, Theatre & Dance fifth year senior 

James Harbaugh, the director of “The Lord 
of the Flies”, brings the story to life in an 
innovative and breathtaking way. Harbaugh 
depicts the young boys’ quick descent into 
chaos as all forms of civilization break down 
in a way that sheds light on a side of humanity 
you never wanted to see but can’t look away 
from.

Harbaugh is a genius when it comes to the 

stage. His vision for this show was shocking 
and terrifying and all around horrible in the 
best possible way. He made smart choices 
that utilized the space, props and actors in 
unexpected ways, while staying true to the 
story.

Instead of an overdone jungle theme, 

Harbaugh put his actors in worker jumpsuits 
and used classroom and construction props 
as the minimal set. Though it wasn’t canon 
with the original story, it made perfect sense 
for this production and didn’t detract from 
the realism of the show. Their fire was a 
rope of orange extension cords, their shelter 
a metal construction lift. He even made use 
of the light box in the studio; the final scene 
depicted Jack stabbing his spear through the 
switch box, killing the lights on his hunt for 
Ralph. This use of technology and modern 
appliances gives the play an almost “Black 
Mirror” feeling, bringing a dated book into 
the modern age with new significance on how 
technology interacts with the very core of 
humanity.

His use of sound effects was minimal and 

effective: Throughout most of the show, 
a hollow wind sound engulfed the stage, 
sucking the air out of the actors and audience 
alike. I don’t think I took a full breath the 
entire show, and suddenly Piggy’s asthma 
predicament didn’t seem so comical.

The most genius part was Harbaugh’s 

casting. Instead of the traditional all male 
cast, he had a mix of male and female actors, 
with females portraying most of the leads. 
Music, Theatre & Dance freshman Claire 
DeJean played Ralph, the textbook honorable, 
but occasionally naive leader; Music, Theatre 
& Dance senior Jillian Lee Garner played Jack, 
the schoolroom bully turned savage hunter; 
and Music, Theatre & Dance junior Shea 
Fairbanks Galaudet played Piggy, the beloved 
superego of the group. These three women 
portrayed their characters with fascinating 

depth and a childlike vigor that didn’t seem 
manufactured. Watching every character 
onstage have an emotional breakdown for two 
hours was exhausting but utterly convincing.

Allowing women to portray these roles 

solved what is most lacking in the original 
book. This story takes the ‘boys being boys’ 
argument to the extreme, but by having the 
majority of the characters played by women, 
the characters became more universally 
human. Not only can these characters as 
women still behave just as savagely and cruelly 
as the original characters, but it also proves 
that women are fully capable of playing these 
types of roles. Rarely are women cast in roles 
that allow them to explore such emotions, 
because it’s even more rare that such roles are 
written for women. By placing women in roles 
that are not only usually portrayed by men 
but are also so viscerally human, Harbaugh 
broke down the expectations that women 
are fundamentally different from men and 
created a story anyone, regardless of gender, 
can see themselves in. Whether they want to 
or not.

The book is disturbing enough; reading 

about 12 year old boys succumbing to their 
wild side, ripping each other to shreds with 
no ounce of morality is gruesome at best and 
emotionally scarring at worst. But seeing that 
story play out onstage was something else 
entirely.

Of course, we all look at those kids and think 

‘I would never do something like that, they’re 
monsters.’ But skimming through “The Lord 
of the Flies” the night before a high school 
English test in the comfort of your bed is one 
thing. Watching real people, people you know, 
people you go to school with and are even 
friends with, unlock that side of themselves 
for a performance makes you realize just 
how easy it could be to succumb to those 
temptations, if put in the right circumstances.

The final performance of “The Lord of the 

Flies” will take place on Friday, Feb. 28 @ 8pm 
in the Newman Studio.

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW

‘Remain in Light’ 
show rocks the 
Michigan Theater

The drummer walked in 

first. The stage was bathed in 
a strobing blue light and he sat 
behind numerous percussion 
instruments. He started with 
his fingertips tapping the 
bongos. Then an additional 
drummer found a place behind 
the traditional drum kit and 
added his coloring of snare 
and high hat. Through just 
this percussion, the Michigan 
Theater 
auditorium 
filled 

up with the lushness of a 
chorus. A guitarist and bassist 
were the last to enter before 
the 
singer. 
The 
foursome 

introduced themselves to the 
audience, already improving 
and riffing off one another’s 
energy. 
Angelique 
Kidjo 

emerged from the shadows 
of the curtains with held her 
head high, strutting into the 
light with boots, a traditional 
headwrap, dress, gold hanging 
earrings and glittery tights. 

Kidjo’s voice rang clear and 

percussive. It looked as if her 
body struggled to contain her 
energy as she stomped and 
swayed with her eyes closed. 
Each time I scribbled in my 
notebook to write something 
down, I was afraid I’d missed 
something during that short 
glance away. 

According 
to 
the 
UMS 

website, Kidjo’s inspiration 
for covering Talking Heads’ 
seminal 1980 album Remain 
in Light was their heavy blues 
and rock influences that trace 
back to Africa. She wanted to 
pay homage to those roots, 
particularly 
West 
African 

music. 

For the performance on 

Feb. 16, Kidjo stood alongside 
her band of Dominic James on 
guitar, Magatte Sow playing 
percussion, Michael Olatuja 

on bass and Yayo Serka on 
drums. 

After just the first song, 

some 
audience 
members 

jumped to their feet and 
stood along the edges of the 
aisles. The bass thudded with 
vibrations that I felt in my 
feet, chest and throat.

I had to keep reminding 

myself that these weren’t her 
songs. Kidjo approached each 
song with such bravado that it 

felt like her own. A few rows 
ahead of me, a man began 
playing air drums in his seat. 
Her enthusiasm and vigor 
ran through each song like a 
bolt of electricity, bringing 
her own funk to the group’s 
classic quirky hits.

In one of the concert’s 

turning points, she threw her 
headscarf off and motioned 

for the audience to get on their 
feet and dance. 

UMS volunteer and Ann 

Arbor resident Lili Henderson 
called Kidjo “a force of nature” 
with “such a big voice for a 
tiny woman, and a unifying 
one.” 

Kidjo dedicated a cover 

to Tina Weymouth, the bass 
player of Talking Heads and 
Mother Earth. She spoke of the 
importance of the feminine 
and taking care of her and the 
women of her earth.

Later, the guitar, bass player 

and Kidjo formed a line to 
shuffle left to right according 
to her direction. Her swagger 
and confidence kept the crowd 
alight with excitement. 

Kidjo introduced us to a new 

millenium. Before launching 
into one of the album’s most 
famous songs, “Once in a 
Lifetime,” 
she 
asked 
the 

audience to change who they 
are by accepting others. She 
emphasized the need for more 
compassion and empathy in 
the world, a way to give back 
to those around us. She then 
ran through the aisles of the 
audience, directing us like 
a conductor above a sea of 
people. 

Back on stage, she invited 

those who wanted to dance 
to come forward, calling men, 
women and children. A little 
boy began breakdancing while 
the percussionist with a drum 
thrown 
over 
his 
shoulder 

clapped him on. Men and 
women got on stage dancing 
and daring each other to battle 
against 
the 
drummer 
and 

Kidjo, who kept pulling new 
people into the dance circle. 

After 
the 
show, 
Amy 

Moore, an audience member, 
approached me to ask about 
the notebook I was holding. 
She wanted to tell me what she 
witnessed. 

“Angelique Kidjo is what the 

world needs now,” Moore said. 
“And, her show is fantastic.”

TV REVIEW
‘Hot Ones’ is fun but inauthentic

JOSHUA THOMAS

For The Daily

The concept behind the YouTube series 

“Hot Ones” is simple: Take the typical 
celebrity interview and spice it up with 
some hot wings. The show is extremely 
well researched, insightful and genuine. 
TruTV has decided to adapt “Hot Ones” 
into a game show on its channel: “Hot 
Ones: The Game Show.” The game show 
centers around two teams of “bros” as 
they devour some hot wings and answer 
some trivia for a cash prize. 

Despite all the game show’s theatricality 

and flair, where the YouTube series is 
wholesome, fun and entertaining, the 
game show is just plain bland. “Hot Ones: 
The Game Show” doesn’t add anything 
new or interesting to the game show 
formula and lacks the heart that made the 
YouTube series so successful. 

So what’s so bad about the game show 

adaptation? 

Let’s start with the host. Part of what 

makes the Hot Ones series on YouTube 
so engaging is the interviewer himself. 
Sean Evans is an absolutely fantastic 
interviewer: He is thoughtful and funny, 
bringing the right amount of energy to 
his interviews. Unfortunately for Sean, 
interviewing celebrities across a table and 
hosting a game show aren’t the same thing. 
His voice hardly carries across the stage, 
and his interactions with contestants are 
dry and lifeless. In the new fantastic 
world of lights and spectacle of the game 
show set, he looks meek and out of his 
element.

The game is divided into three rounds: 

In the first two rounds, the teams “clean 
the wing,” answering a series of trivia 
from Sean for increasingly large cash 
prizes. If a team answers a question 
incorrectly, the other team automatically 
wins that money. The categories of 
questions revolve around pop culture. In 
the final round, the team with the most 
money has the chance to win $25,000 by 
playing a condensed version of charades. 

The game’s structure doesn’t provide 

that much entertainment, either. Since a 
team that answers incorrectly has more to 
lose, it is a riskier move to answer a trivia 
question than to stay silent. During the 
premiere, one team walked away almost 
uncontested despite not attempting to 
answer the majority of the trivia. Besides 
these strange rules, the show doesn’t 
present its audience with anything else 
that any other game show hasn’t done a 
thousand times before, and better. If not 
for the hot wings, the show would look 
like “Jeopardy!” for dude-bros. 

Despite all of this, there are some 

aspects of the show that aren’t all 
that bad: The set itself is incredible. It 
maintains the dark, ambient design of 
the original YouTube series with an 
updated version of the iconic logo. The 
show also has “behind the scenes” footage 
of contestants struggling to finish their 
intensely spicy wings (the puke bucket is 
also a nice touch).

They say all good things must come to 

an end. In that case, all good YouTube 
channels must become game shows. 

Television has a way of eating up the 
authenticity of YouTube and spitting out 
the shell. Lucky for those of us with a 
sense of taste, Hot Ones has returned to 
YouTube for season 11.

Friday, February 28, 2020 — 7

Thursday 
afternoon, 
the Michigan hockey team 
departed for Minneapolis to 
embark on a challenging yet 
crucial weekend series.
The 
Wolverines 
are 
searching 
for 
critical 
conference points to help them 
surge up the standings and 
potentially get home ice for 
the opening round of the Big 
Ten Tournament. 
Before the recent home 
series against Notre Dame, it 
seemed likely that Michigan 
would host the first round. 
The Wolverines were riding 
the momentum of a hot second 
half of the season, in which 
they’d won 26 of 30 points. But 
getting swept by the Fighting 
Irish 
slowed 
down 
their 
strides. 
Now, they need a successful 
weekend against a surging 
Minnesota team that’s playing 
for the regular season title to 
right the ship.
“It’s a challenge,” Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson said. “We 
didn’t do ourselves any favors 
this past weekend, and we 
put ourselves in a tougher 
spot than we could’ve been. 
Absolutely. But that’s on us 
and that’s sports.”
Through 
the 
looming 
challenge, 
though, 
lies 
a 
similar 
situation. 
In 
both 
of the last two seasons, the 
Wolverines entered the final 
weekend of regular season 
conference play looking for 
key points to secure home ice 
for the tournament. 
In 
Pearson’s 
first 
year 
Michigan thrived with its back 
against the wall, sweeping 
the nation’s top-ranked Notre 
Dame team in a home-and-
home series to make its way 
back to Yost Ice Arena for 
the tournament. But in the 
same spot last season, the 
Wolverines lost two overtime 
road games to Wisconsin and 
fell short of what they needed 
to host.
“It’s just like a mindset 
going 
in,” 
senior 
forward 
Will 
Lockwood 
said. 
“We 
know Minnesota is going to 
be coming out hot because 
they’re playing for a chance 
to win the Big Ten regular 
season. We gotta match that 
intensity and bring a little bit 
more. That’s been the word 
around the room, understand 
what they’re playing for and 
what we’re playing for is more 
important to us.”
Since 
the 
conference 
tournament was created in 
2014, home teams have lost in 
the opening round just twice. 

From prior experience, the 
Wolverines are aware of what 
a difference home ice can 
make in the first round. 
Playing at home two seasons 
ago, Michigan made it out of 
the opening round against the 
Badgers. Last year in the first 
round, the team’s season came 
to an end in Minneapolis. With 
little chance of an at large bid 
to the NCAA Tournament, a 
first-round loss would end this 
season as well.
“It’s 
a 
night 
and 
day 
different experience, playing 
at home and playing on the 
road,” senior forward Nick 
Pastujov said, comparing the 
past two tournaments. “We 
just got to make sure we do 
everything we can to come 
back here.”
Pearson 
is 
a 
little 
less 
certain 
of 
the 
advantage 
of 
playing 
at 
home. 
He 
mentioned it should generally 
be a sizable advantage but that 
hasn’t really panned out this 
season for the Wolverines — 
their home and road records 
are balanced, 7-7-2 and 6-6-1, 
respectively. Regardless, his 
preference is clear.
“If you asked me right now, 
would you rather have home 
ice playing somebody or have 
to go on the road and play 
somebody, I’d say, ‘Hey, I’d 
rather be at home,’ ” Pearson 
said. 
“Even 
though 
we’re 
undefeated on the road in the 
second half of the year.”
There’s a bit of circularity 
to Michigan’s position. The 
Wolverines want home ice for 
the tournament and to get it 
they must thrive this weekend 
— on the road. The recent road 
success Pearson alluded to is 
something 
Michigan 
plans 
to rely on this weekend in its 
fight to win home ice. But it’s 
also what the team hopes to 
fall back on if they don’t return 
to Ann Arbor.
In 
other 
words, 
if 
the 
Wolverines 
can 
continue 
with the road success they’ve 
had, everything they want to 
accomplish this season — a run 
in the Big Ten Tournament 
and a spot in the NCAA 
Tournament — is still on the 
table. And it all starts with the 
trip this weekend, in a similar 
situation as before.
“It’s going to be tough going 
into Minnesota,” Pearson said. 
“They’re playing for a league 
championship. 
They’ve 
got 
a lot on the line. So we just 
have to get back to our game, 
understand that we’ve played 
extremely well this second 
half, we’ve played extremely 
well on the road in the second 
half of the season, and we’ve 
won in Minnesota before.”

A familiar spot for ‘M’

After poor weekend, Carol Hutchins looks for an offensive turnaround

It’s hard to pinpoint exactly 
what 
plagued 
the 
Michigan 
softball team’s offense at last 
weekend’s Gamecock Invitational. 
Despite coming in undefeated, 
the Wolverines limped home with 
a 1-3 record on the tournament, 
scoring more than one run just 
once in four games.
It’s hard to know exactly 
why, but Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins has some ideas. 
Their 
swings 
lacked 
connection. They lost focus on 
the one-pitch mindset. They got 
anxious when they were behind 
the count. The technical flaws 
Hutchins saw last weekend go on, 

but she pointed to one overarching 
answer: They got cocky. 
“Without 
being 
able 
to 
articulate it, I often say that 
winning can make you soft,” 
Hutchins said. “And they had won 
a bunch in a row, and I don’t think 
they expected it to be difficult. 
Which is the only expectation I 
think you should ever have.”
The Wolverines’ offense didn’t 
produce and they left South 
Carolina with a total of seven runs 
over four games.
Michigan will have to make 
mental and physical adjustments 
going into this weekend’s Judi 
Garman Classic in Los Angeles. 
The Wolverines will face their 
highest-ranked competitors of 
the non-conference slate: No. 2 

Washington, No. 3 Texas and No. 
25 Texas Tech. 
Michigan has pulled out wins 
against ranked teams before. On 
Mar. 1 last year, the Wolverines 
took down UCLA — No. 2 in 
the country at the time — in the 
Bruins’ first and only loss until 
Apr. 12. Two days later, they 
edged out No. 5 Washington, 4-2. 
Earlier this month, they blew out 
No. 7 Florida in a sixth-inning run 
rule.
But, with the notable exception 
of this year’s game against the 
Gators, most of those ranked 
match-ups were won on the backs 
of pitchers. The combination of 
sophomore 
right-hander 
Alex 
Storako and junior left-hander 
Meghan Beaubien have frequently 

kept the Wolverines in the game 
while the offense struggled.
As Hutchins has said time and 
again, it’s the pitcher’s job to pick 
up the slack when the batters 
aren’t producing. But the reverse 
is also true. 
When 
Michigan’s 
pitching 
staff struggled last weekend, the 
offense wasn’t there to lift them 
up.
This weekend, it seems unlikely 
Beaubien and Storako will be able 
to keep powerhouse teams like 
Washington scoreless, no matter 
how on-point their games are.
Out of 16 games thus far, the 
Huskies have been held below 
five runs just three times. While 
the Longhorns lack that level of 
consistency, they’ve won 11 out 

of their 18 games with runs in the 
double digits. So far this season, 
the Wolverines haven’t been able 
to reach that level offensively, 
averaging just above four runs a 
game. 
A huge portion of the disparity 
comes from power hitting. Texas 
has 13 home runs so far. Texas 
Tech, 12. The Huskies, 18. 
Michigan has just 6.
In Hutchins’ eye, it’s not 
that the team lacks power. It’s a 
problem of pitch selection. 
“When you swing at crap you 
usually hit it crappy,” Hutchins 
said. “(Last weekend) they swung 
and we didn’t swing at very many 
good pitches. And we took a lot of 
pitches, we took a lot of strikes.”
Over the past month, there 

have been small glimpses of 
the power the Wolverines are 
capable of. Facing Florida on Feb. 
8, Michigan fired off two homers 
and four doubles, totaling six RBI, 
en route to a 11-2 win. 
While Michigan is ranked 
No. 13 and boasts a 10-3 record, 
to compete at the next level, the 
Wolverines are gong to need 
more. Specifically, they’re going 
to need to channel the power they 
found against the Gators and the 
confidence at the plate they found 
in a 10-game win streak. 
It’s not a question of whether 
Michigan has the offense to 
compete against these ranked 
opponents. 
It’s a question of whether it can 
turn it on.

Second half run propels Michigan past Penn State

Amy Dilk stood at the top of 
the 3-point arc one minute into 
the second half and surveyed her 
options.
The sophomore guard tried to 
swing a pass to junior forward 
Hailey Brown, but Penn State 
guard Shay Hagans read it from 
the start. She quickly jumped the 
pass and took it the other way for 
a layup to put the Nittany Lions up 
by two. It was the first time they led 
since the first minute of the game.
Michigan quickly rebounded. 
Two minutes later, the game 
now tied, senior guard Akienreh 
Johnson took a charge, and on the 
subsequent offensive possession, 
found a cutting Dilk on an easy 
give-and-go to take a two-point 
lead. The Wolverines (19-9 overall, 
10-7 Big Ten) proceeded to go on a 
33-7 run over the next 10 minutes 
to defeat the Nittany Lions (7-21, 

1-16), 80-66, on Thursday.
“I thought we took care of the 
ball a lot better in the second half,” 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico 
said. “I thought we found each 
other and made some extra passes. 
We had 24 assists on the night, so I 
think once we relaxed and settled 
in, and were able to figure out 
what they were trying to do on the 
defensive end, we were able to be a 
lot more successful.”
Heading into the contest, the 
Wolverines’ NCAA Tournament 
chances looked strong, and the 
win wouldn’t do much to improve 
them. But a loss to a Penn State 
team at the bottom of the Big Ten 
could have been detrimental, 
and halfway through the game, it 
looked like Michigan could cough 
up what should have been an easy 
win.
In 
the 
first 
quarter, 
the 
Wolverines took a 10-point lead 
on the back of three 3-pointers. 
Guard Niyeh Frazier was the only 

player who could get into a rhythm 
for the Nittany Lions — she scored 
seven without missing a shot, 
while the rest of the team shot just 
25 percent. Through one quarter, 
the game was as advertised — an 
easy night for Michigan and a 
chance for a tune-up before the 
postseason.
The second quarter told a 
different story. Michigan’s half-
court offense struggled greatly, 
providing Penn State with ample 
opportunity to get back in the 
game. The Wolverines committed 
11 turnovers in the second quarter 
alone.
While the Nittany Lions shot 
just 35 percent in the quarter, the 
extra opportunities they got from 
Michigan’s 
turnovers 
allowed 
them to cut the deficit to three by 
halftime, led by 10 from Frazier. 
The 
Wolverines 
struggled 
to 
score when they couldn’t get out 
in transition, and finished with 
just 10 points in the quarter — six 

from sophomore forward Naz 
Hillmon. What started out looking 
like a comfortable win became 
one Michigan had to grind out to 
prevent a bad loss.
Halftime gave the Wolverines 
a chance to regroup, and they 
responded. Despite the slow start 
that allowed Penn State to take a 
lead, Michigan’s ball security and 
passing in the second half was 
much better than it had been in 
the first. The Wolverines came out 
motivated, clearly aware of how 
devastating a loss would be. 
“We had to figure out how to 
handle the double post of Naz, and 
Amy’s being pressured 94 feet, 
where’s she getting her pressure 
releases from,” Barnes Arico said. 
“So those were some adjustments 
that we tried to talk about at 
halftime to help Naz and Amy out 
of those situations.”
In 
the 
second 
half, 
the 
Wolverines turned the ball over 
just five times, while quick passing 
allowed them to get easy baskets in 
the half-court offense. Hillmon led 
the way, scoring 14 of her 26 points, 
while freshman guard Maddie 
Nolan added 10, including back-
to-back 3-pointers in the third 
quarter that extended the lead 
from eight to 14.
“I really tried to run the floor 
today,” Hillmon said. “That’s one 
of my strong suits, getting the ball 
up and down the floor and getting 
easy paint touches.”
Because of a sloppy first half, 
Michigan couldn’t relax in a game 
that shouldn’t have been much of a 
challenge. Instead, it had to buckle 
down and correct its mistakes 
to avoid what could have been a 
crushing blow to its postseason 
chances.
It wasn’t always easy. But the 
Wolverines survived.

Wolverines look to bounce back in California

Last June, the Wolverines filed 
out of the first-base dugout down 
into the annals of TD Ameritrade 
Stadium as the entire Vanderbilt 
baseball program jumped and 
hugged 
around 
the 
pitcher’s 
mound.
The Commodores had just won 
the decisive third game to become 
national champions. Michigan left 
Omaha one game short of glory. 
In 
recovering 
from 
a 
disappointing end to what was 
otherwise a positive season, the 
2020 Wolverines decided to use 
the narrow gap between their 2019 
campaign and a College World 
Series as motivation.
“We were one win away from 
being alone on the top of the 
mountain,” Michigan coach Erik 
Bakich said. “So we reduced that 
‘one more’ to one more day of 
training, one more inning better, 
one more pitch better. And then 
obviously the things we do in here 
is just one more repetition, one 
more weight lifting session, one 
more meeting, one more rep.
“We just needed to be one 
percent better to be the final team.”
Over the course of the offseason, 
Bakich sought to do everything in 
his power to prepare his team to 
return to Omaha and be one game 
better when they arrive.
If 
the 
Wolverines’ 
No. 
9 
preseason ranking and the relative 
weakness of the Big Ten left any 
questions as to whether Michigan 
would face any adversity, the tough 
out-of-conference schedule that 

Bakich set for his team has already 
started to answer it. 
On 
opening 
weekend, 
the 
Wolverines took on two top-five 
teams in then-No. 1 Vanderbilt and 
then-No. 3 Arizona State and two 
impressive programs in Cal Poly 
and UConn. 
Michigan came out of that 
week looking like a team that was 
ready to be on top of the mountain. 
The Wolverines went 3-1 on the 
weekend, leaving the two best 
hitters in college baseball, Arizona 
State junior first basemen Spencer 
Torkelson and Vanderbilt junior 
third baseman Austin Martin, 
hitless in wins against each of their 
respective teams. The only loss on 
the weekend was against UConn 
in a game in which the Wolverines 

reached so deep into their bullpen 
the loss appeared meaningless.
Apparently, though, it was a sign 
of things to come.
Michigan played the Huskies 
three more times last weekend, 
losing the series and seeing its first 
piece of adversity.
“I think the difference was just 
our level of compete,” Michigan 
junior shortstop Jack Blomgren 
said after Sunday’s 9-2 loss. “They 
attacked us early and came on hot, 
and we didn’t really answer until 
later on in the game. So overall, they 
competed harder than us today.”
Michigan can’t expect to be 
one game better this June if it 
continues to allow talented teams 
to outcompete it.
The efforts in the UConn series 

left a sour taste in many players’ 
mouths, but thanks to Bakich’s 
scheduling, the Wolverines have 
the opportunity to reverse this 
trend almost immediately.
This weekend, Michigan plays 
three more games against Cal Poly, 
heads up and down California to 
take on Stanford and California 
in single games and then goes to 
Pepperdine for a three-game series. 
While none of these programs 
are currently ranked, they are 
all highly-esteemed and highly-
talented — fully capable of beating 
the fifth-ranked Wolverines.
To leave the next 10 days still 
looking like they can be one game 
better than last year, Michigan will 
need to respond to last weekend’s 
adversity.

WITH BROOKS OUT, 
D’MITRIK TRICE 
TORCHES MICHIGAN’S 
DEFENSE AS BADGERS 
TOP WOLVERINES, 81-74

Comeback falls short as Wisconsin 
beats Wolverines, 81-74, at Crisler

There are a lot of adjectives 
that describe Thursday night’s 
matchup between Michigan and 
Wisconsin. 
Gritty. Streaky. Roller coaster.
And at the end of it all, the 
Wolverines (18-10 overall, 9-8 
Big Ten) fell to Wisconsin (18-10, 
11-6), 81-74, after an inconsistent 
offensive performance and an 
onslaught of drained 3-pointers 
by the Badgers.
Despite the spotty offense, 
the Wolverines embarked on 
plenty of electric scoring runs. 
But it was on defense where they 
struggled most. 
Wisconsin 
shoots 
more 
3-pointers 
than 
anyone 
else in the Big Ten, and the 
Wolverines fell behind when 
those shots started hitting. At 
times, Wisconsin’s lead seemed 
an 
uncrossable 
chasm, 
and 
Michigan seemed ill-equipped 
to stop it from growing. 
“We did a very bad job of 
defending on the perimeter,” 
Michigan coach Juwan Howard 
said. “Overall, our defense did 
not get enough stops. … Huge let 
down. On the entire team, as far 
as how we’re defending. And a 
poor job from me on preparing 
our guys, so I’ll take the blame 
on it. I didn’t prepare them very 
well.”
The Wolverines got off to a 
slow start on both ends of the 
court without junior guard 
Eli Brooks, who was sidelined 
after sustaining a nose injury 
against Purdue last Saturday. 

After settling into the game, 
the offense seemed to find its 
rhythm after making some quick 
shots, but it was a rhythm they 
fell in and out of throughout the 
course of the game. Michigan 
paid for that inconsistency late 
in the game.

“We made a couple runs 
in the second half, and then 
they made some tough shots,” 
freshman wing Franz Wagner 
said. “I don’t think we lost the 
game in the second half. I think 
we just didn’t play like we have 
to in the first half. They got into 
a rhythm, and they made us pay 
at the end.”
But, as Wisconsin slowed 
down, 
Michigan 
gradually 
made its way back into the 
game, fighting back from a 

14-point deficit to draw even 
with 15 minutes remaining in 
regulation. But again, the game 
slipped out of its hands.
With 10 minutes left, the 
game was again within reach 
for the Wolverines. But even 
when the game was close, or 
felt close, Michigan just could 
not do enough to control the 
game the way it needed. The 
Wolverines couldn’t get shots 
to fall when they needed them 
most. And they couldn’t stop 
Wisconsin from sinking dagger 
after dagger.
“We always talk about getting 
stops and getting out for wide 
open 
dunks, 
layups, 
threes 
and getting to the free throw 
line,” sophomore guard David 
DeJulius said. “We didn’t get an 
opportunity to play pace-and-
space.”
The pieces are there. The 
offensive power Michigan put 
on against Michigan State and 
Indiana. The gritty defense 
the Wolverines played against 
Rutgers 
and 
Northwestern. 
When Michigan is able to put 
those things together, it has 
a chance at beating any team 
in 
college 
basketball. 
The 
Wolverines proved that in the 
Bahamas, and over the five-
game winning streak that just 
ended.
But against Wisconsin on 
Thursday night, Michigan just 
couldn’t piece together enough 
to win.
It was, more than anything 
else, a matter of consistency.
And the Wolverines couldn’t 
seem to find it.

Without Brooks, defense struggles

When Juwan Howard was 
asked about Eli Brooks’s nose on 
Wednesday, he leaned back in 
his podium chair and laughed.
During the Michigan men’s 
basketball 
team’s 
win 
over 
Purdue last Saturday, the junior 
guard found himself at the 
wrong place at the wrong time 
during a Boilermaker baseline 
inbounds pass. As he trailed 
his defensive assignment, the 
shoulder of a Purdue screener 
caught him square in the face. 
The collison fractured his nose.
For 
a 
while, 
Howard’s 
laughter didn’t stop. If there’s 
anyone familiar enough with 
the injury to chuckle, it’s the 
Wolverines’ first-year coach, 
who broke his nose three times 
during his 19-year NBA career.
But when Howard took a 
seat at the same podium a mere 
30 hours later, there was no 
laughter. As Brooks watched 
from 
the 
bench 
in 
street 
clothes, his nose swallowed by a 
bandage, Michigan’s perimeter 
defense — his personal calling 
card — proved to be its pitfall in 
an 81-74 loss to Wisconsin.
“(Brooks) is our anchor,” 
Howard said. “Yes, (senior point 
guard) Zavier (Simpson) is a 
John Wooden finalist for one 
of the (top-10) best defensive 
players 
this 
year, 
but 
I’m 
surprised Eli is not mentioned 
as one of the best defensive 
players this season because 
he has been the anchor of our 
defense. Just his presence — we 
saw how we missed his activity, 
we missed his energy, being 
able to guard guys and attention 

to detail when it comes to the 
scouting report.”
The 
defeat 
snapped 
the 
Wolverines’ five-game winning 
streak 
— 
a 
season-altering 
stretch defined by a defensive 
turnaround. Over the three 
weeks leading up to Thursday, 
Michigan’s 
defense 
allowed 
opponents to score an average 
of just 60.4 points on 37 percent 
shooting.
For nearly a month, Brooks 
had been at the forefront of that 
revival.
Without 
Brooks, 
the 
Wolverines 
repeatedly 
surrendered 
uncontested 
looks, opening the door for 
the Badgers to 
cruise 
to 
81 
points 
on 
a 
54-percent 
shooting 
clip. 
It 
was 
the 
highest 
field 
goal percentage 
Michigan 
has 
allowed at home 
this season.
“Eli 
is 
the 
best 
defender 
on our team,” freshman wing 
Franz Wagner said. “He brings 
it every night. So we missed 
him, definitely. … We didn’t 
communicate well enough and 
our energy, especially in the 
first half, it was horrible.”
The 
impact 
of 
Brooks’s 
absence was apparent from the 
start. Wisconsin canned its first 
three attempts from beyond the 
arc, opening up a double-digit 
lead just five minutes into the 
game. 
The Badgers, who entered 
the night with the conference’s 
second-best 
3-point 
clip, 

eventually used their success 
from beyond the arc to create 
pump-fake opportunities and 
driving lanes. The approach 
kept Michigan on its heels for 
much of the first half, and by the 
final buzzer, Wisconsin guard 
D’Mitrik Trice’s 28 points were 
enough to leave Crisler Center 
with a win.
Without 
Brooks, 
the 
Wolverines 
allowed 
Trice 
to enjoy a 10-for-16 shooting 
mark. Simpson, Wagner and 
sophomore 
guard 
David 
DeJulius all tried their hands at 
stopping him on the perimeter, 
only to see him post a 5-of-6 
performance from deep that 
impacted 
more than just 
Michigan’s 
defense.
“We didn’t get 
an opportunity 
to 
play 
pace-
and-space,” 
DeJulius 
said. 
“The gameplan 
(was) 
to 
run 
them 
off 
the 
3-point line. We 
understand the great assets 
they have from beyond the 
line.”
When the Wolverines did 
find ways to put a hand in 
Trice’s face, they were plagued 
by 
miscommunications 
that 
left other Wisconsin shooters 
open behind the 3-point line. 
They ultimately surrendered a 
season-worst 11 3-pointers.
To DeJulius, the root of the 
problem cut deeper than the 
surface.
“It’s not really about X’s and 
O’s,” he said. “It’s about effort 
and what’s inside your heart.”

I think we just 
didn’t play (the 
way) we have 
to in the first 
half, they got 
into a rhythm 
... made us pay.
