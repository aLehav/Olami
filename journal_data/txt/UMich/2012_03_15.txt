STATE BUDGET
Coleman
critical of

budget

Passengers ride an Ann Arbor Transit Authority bus yesterday. If the four-party agreement comes to fruition routes and services will be expanded.

In testimony in
Lansing, president
advocates for more
state funding
By PAIGE PEARCY and
JOSH QIAN
Daily News Editor and
Daily Staff Reporter
University President Mary
Sue Coleman chided state law-
makers yesterday as she criti-
cized Republican Gov. Rick
Snyder's proposed 2013 budget
that would use a new formula
to allocate state funding to uni-
versities.
in her annual testing before
the state House Higher Educa-
tion Appropriation Subcom-
mittee in Lansing, Coleman
said, "The funding recommen-
dations looks back and not for-
ward. Achievement counts for
little."
Snyder's budget proposal
would increase funding for
public universities and com-
munity colleges by 3 percent
if approved, translating into a
$36.2 million increase in funds

for higher education in the
state.
Though Coleman said she
applauds the increase, one of
her concerns is that the appro-
priation is being partially deter-
mined by performance-based
metrics, which she and Uni-
versity Provost Philip Hanlon
do not favor. They expressed
that improving the University's
performance for more state
funding would be challenging
because it is already perform-
ing at a high level.
"The metrics compare the
state's universities against each
other, rather than against their
Carnegie classification peers,"
Coleman said in her testimony.
A new allocation formula
has also been developed based
on growth in number of under-
graduate degrees completed,
number of undergraduate
degree completions in critical
skills areas, number of under-
graduate Pell Grant recipients
and compliance with tuition
restraint.
In a Feb. 24 interview with
The Michigan Daily, Coleman
also expressed disappointment
with the plan.

Increased routes,

* pending proposal
By TAYLOR WIZNER
Daily StaffReporter
While the city of Ann Arbor
awaits approval of a four-par-
ty agreement for a proposed
county-wide transit author-
ity by Washtenaw County and

Ypsilanti, students and Univer-
sity employees are also eagerly
anticipating the arrival of an
array of mass transit improve-
ments.
The four-party agreement,
approved by the city of Ann
Arbor March 5, would provide
additional transit services across
the county, including expansion
of routes and increased trans-
portation access. Jim Kosteva,
the University's director of com-
munity relations, said the agree-
ment changes many elements of
the current transit system that

will directly impact University
students and employees.
"If this plan and its funding
is approved, the intension is to
expand along existing routes,
services to other counties and
provide additional transporta-
tion," Kosteva said. "The goal
is to expand everyone's trans-
portation options (including)
patients, visitors, students."
Ann Arbor Transportation
Association spokeswoman Mary
Stasiak wrote in an e-mail inter-
view that a majority of riders
use the buses for trips to work

or school, with 35 percent of rid-
ers using TheRide for work, and
40.3 percent using it for school.
Stasiak was unable to provide
statistics specifically for Uni-
versity-affiliated riders.
Ypsilanti resident Joseph
Ansong, a research fellow at the
University, said he takes the bus
every day to and from his home
in Ypsilanti. Ansong said he is
content with the current service
of the buses, but wishes they
would come more regularly.

Organization aims
to keep students
in Michigan after
they graduate
By CHELSEA LANDRY
Daily StaffReporter
With graduation quickly
approaching, many seniors
are beginning to think more

intently about their future
plans, which may require them
to relocate to cities such as New
York, Chicago or Los Angeles.
However, one Ann Arbor com-
pany is looking for incentives to
encourage grads stay in Michi-
gan.
Ann Arbor SPARK, an orga-
nization dedicated to creating
high-tech jobs in Michigan,
recently received a $100,000
grant from the Michigan Eco-
nomic Development Corpora-

tion in March. The funding will
support SPARK's MichAGAIN
program, a series of events
aimed at bringing recent college
graduates and professionals
back to Michigan.
Donna Doleman, vice presi-
dent of marketing, communica-
tions and talent for SPARK, said
she hopes that the grant will
strengthen her organization's
efforts to bring talent to Michi-
gan.

For the Daily
Amid the slew of students
sprawled across the grass enjoy-
ing the warmer weather yester-
day, a parade of students singing

songs and carrying balloons ran
across the Diag en route to Angell
Hall to interrupt a lecture by
American Cultures Lecturer
Bruce Conforth, bearing the
news that he had been chosen for
this year's Golden Apple Award.
The award, given annually by
a University of Michigan Hil-
lel student committee called
Students Honoring Outstanding
Teaching, is given to a University
professor or lecturer who dem-
onstrates an exceptional dedica-
tion to teaching.
This year, about 100 profes-

sors were nominated, according
to members of SHOUT. The com-
mittee evaluates the quality of
each recommendation to decide
which professor has the stron-
gest commitment to excellence
in teaching before making their
final decision.
Conforth, who has been teach-

first started at the University in
2004, was also recently filmed

Snyder, Bing spar
over Detroit's fate
The debate over how best to
help Detroit avoid going broke
has escalated into a war of words
between the city's mayor and
Michigan's governor.
Gov. Rick Snyder yesterday
urged city leaders to get over
their "cultural challenge" by
accepting his plan for reviving
Detroit's financial health. But
local officials snapped back that
they're up to the job.
Detroit leaders have just over
a week to decide if they're going
to enter into a consent agree-
ment with the state that includes
a nine-member oversight board.
If they don't, they face the likely
appointment of an emergency
manager who would have even
more sweeping powers over the
city.
NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ.
Jury gets case in
Rutgers webcam
spying trial
After nearly two weeks of tes-
timony, the case that kick-start-
ed national conversations about
gay youths and Internet privacy
was sent yesterday to a jury that
must decide whether a former
Rutgers University student is
a criminal or just a young man
who was confused by seeing two
men kiss.
Dharun Ravi, now 20, is
accused of viewing a few sec-
onds of his roommate's intimate
encounter with another man in
their dorm room at Rutgers and
telling people about it in text
messages, tweets and in person.
He could face years in prison
if convicted of charges includ-
ing invasion of privacy and bias
intimidation, a hate crime.
Lawyers gave their summa-
tions Tuesday in the case, which
has gotten enormous attention
since the events of September
2010, when the roommate, Tyler
Clementi, jumped to his death
from the George Washington
Bridge.
KABUL

OBAMA
From Page 1A
the College Democrats, was an
ardent Obama supporter in 2008
and said she is looking forward
to campaigning for his re-elec-
tion this year. She pointed to his
progress on issues pertinent to
students - college loans and the
jobs economy in particular - in
calling Obama "the education
president."
"Even people who aren't in the
College Dems have seen (how
much he's done for education)
and will see it when they go to pay
back student loans and realize
how difficult it is," Brill added.
"He's made it a little easier, and I
think students have noticed."
Across campus, Brill said she
thought Obama likely has about
the same support as he did in the
2008 election. While she said
the enthusiasm levels of the last
election cycle might be difficult
to replicate since the histori-
cal nature of his presidency has
passed, Brill added that Obama's
progress in the last four years
should maintain his student sup-
port.
Abraham agreed with Brill
that Obama will find student sup-
port in his educational accom-
plishments, specifically as a result
of his advocacy for Pell Grants
and his introduction of the new
income-based loan repayment

program. Abraham added that
the students she has encountered
at the University have expressed
excitement to restart their efforts
toward aiding Obama's re-elec-
tion.
"There's a lot of enthusiasm
around the campaign and for
everything he's done for people
our age," Abraham said.
In the last presidential elec-
tion, Obama's campaign depend-
ed on the support of students
nationwide, especially at the
University. Data from student-
dominated polling places in 2008
showed a 14-percent increase in
presidential election ballots cast
from the 2004 election.
Still, a growing number of stu-
dents are growing dissatisfied
with Obama's record during his
first term and feel that he hasn't
delivered on his original cam-
paign promises of change.
LSA freshman Vitaliy Studen-
nyy said she believes Obama had
a "decent" first term, but failed
to bring the change he promised
during his last campaign.
"He hasn't lived up to the hype
that he's created," Studennyy
said. "He said he was going to
change things before he got elect-
ed, and right now, he's justgradu-
ally building up to it and making
these same promises again going
up to the next election."
Other students said the coun-
try's economic outlook has
worsened under the Obama

administration. Rackham stu-
dent Benjamin Stewart, who
said he did not vote for Obama
in 2008, said he is concerned
that the deficit and government
spending have continued to rise
over the last few years.
"I was pretty adamant against
what Bush had been doing with
the deficit, and I think it's been
either a continuation or a worsen-
ing under Obama," Stewart said.
Before Obama's election in
2008, the University's chapter of
College Democrats hosted mass
meetings during which they
registered 1,741 new voters and
enrolled more than 1,200 stu-
dents on their e-mail list during
the first week of September.
Nathanial Eli Coats Styer,
then-chair of the University's
chapter of College Democrats,
said he had never seen such a
high level of enthusiasm for a
candidate on campus, following
a 2008 meeting in which 100 of
300 attendees could not fit in the
room.
"The excitement on campus
is amazing," Styer said. "I don't
think that we've ever matched
this kind of excitement."
Brill said the group's January
mass meeting, which the group
advertised as the start of the 2012
campaign push for Obama, was
also packed with attendees.
"Students should know that
Obama's got their back, so they
should have his," Brill said.

"I'm flabbergasted," Conforth
said in an interview after the
announcement. "I think this is
the most amazing thing that's
ever happened to me in my teach-
ing career. It was the first time I
was absolutely speechless."
LSA senior Courtney Mercier,
who is taking her second class
with Conforth this semester, said
she was not surprised that he

was recognized with the honor
due to his dedication to teaching.
"He's such a great professor
to receive this award," Mercier
said. "(In my first class with Con-
forth) he wasn't just teaching to
teach, he really wanted (us) to
take something away from this
and apply it to our everyday life."
LSA sophomore Jill Effron
agreed, expressing how much
she admires Conforth's unre-
served and engaging teaching
style. She recalled a time when
he enthusiastically read poet
Allen Ginsberg's works aloud in
lecture, unabashedly including
all the explicit language in order
for the students to get an authen-
tic presentation of the work.
According to Conforth, relat-
ing to his students is something
he ventures to do with every
class. In his office - a room cov-
ered in brightly colored rock 'n
roll posters and relics of the hip-
She also said the goal of the
University's upcoming capital
campaign will be to raise funds
to help lessen student debt.
"I believe when we focus on
reducing student debt, we are
targeting the largest challenge
for students," Coleman said in
her testimony. "Your debt bur-
den should not prohibit you from
attending college or pursuing the
field of study that is most impor-
tant to you. We will work hard at
student debt reduction over the
next few years."
Coleman also spoke of the
University's cost containment
and reduction efforts that have
been implemented since she
came to the University in 2002.
By 2017, the plans will have saved
the University about $355 mil-
lion, she said.
"Despite the 35-percent reduc-
tion in state support over the past
decade, our University sits on a
stable financial foundation today

pie era - Conforth explained the
way his own life experience per-
meates his lectures.
"I think the most important
thing is just being honest about
who you are," Conforth said.
"Students can sense when a
teacher is being honest and real
... I am what I teach, I teach about
what I love, and hopefully that
comes across."
Conforth's classes are among
the most popular at the Univer-
sity and in 2010, the waitlist for
Conforth's "Beatniks, Hippies
and Punks" course filled to 50
students in just the first day of
registration.
For Mercier, the content of the
class combined with Conforth's
teaching abilities explains the
draw of students to the course.
"I never thought that Ameri-
can folklore, beatniks, hippies
and punks could be interesting,"
Mercier said.
because we began tackling the
cost drivers for higher education
long ago," Coleman said.
She also discussed the recent
research fellowship created with
Dow Chemical, announced this
week, which will add 300 new
fellowship positions and other
research opportunities at the
University.
"We are generating an enor-
mous amount of important
research in the life sciences,"
Coleman said. "This is a huge
range of activity from basic sci-
ence to the application of that
science in areas such as medical
devices and technologies."
Cotter said he heard "a lot of
positive" in Coleman's testimony,
adding that though changes may
not be made to the state's fund-
ing for higher education from
Coleman's testimony specifically,
the committee will consider her
suggestions during their delib-
erations.

Panetta safe after BUDGET
From Page 1A
vehicle crashes on

Afghan runway
An Afghan driver somehow
caught fire yesterday when he
crashed a stolen truck as U.S.
Secretary of Defense Leon
Panetta's plane was landing
nearby, officials said.
No one in Panetta's party was
hurt, said a Pentagon spokes-
man, Navy Capt. John Kirby.
In the bizarre incident, the
pickup truck traveled at high
speed and crashed into a ditch
near the ramp where Panetta's
plane was going to park at the
British airfield in Helmand prov-
ince in southern Afghanistan.
Suddenly the driver caught
on fire, but the truck did not
explode, said Col. Gary Kolb,
a U.S. military spokesman in
Afghanistan, countering earlier
reports that the vehicle burst
into flames. The driver was
treated for burns.

James Murdoch
admits failings in
phone hackings
News Corp. executive James
Murdoch acknowledged yester-
day that he could have done more
to get to grips with the phone
hacking scandal that has rocked
Britain and threatened his place
as the likely heir to his father's
global media empire.
Murdoch's admission came
in a seven-page letter written to
British parliamentarians inves-
tigating the scandal. In it, the
39-year-old repeated his insis-
tence that he didn't know the
extent of the illegal behavior at
his now-defunct News of the
World tabloid newspaper, saying
that the details had been hid-
den from him by members of his
staff.

"Under this, the University
would only experience a 1.4-per-
cent increase," Coleman said.
She added that she hopes Sny-
der and the state Legislature
will reconsider the metrics in
consideration of the University's
unique circumstances.
"This is a one-time funding
and can get taken away next
year," Coleman said last month.
"I can't build anything into base
since I don't know what will be
there next year, including stu-
dent programs."
Coleman also explained to the
committee yesterday that the
increase in funding this year is
positive after a decade of cuts
and welcomed by the University.
However, she noted that more
needs to be done.
"I'd like to see the Legisla-
ture set a goal of getting the
state back into the top 10 of state
funding for higher education,"
Coleman said. "I recognize that
would be a long-term goal, but
setting a goal is the first step
toward achievement."
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily, State Rep.
Kevin Cotter (R-Mt. Pleasant),
one of the committee mem-
bers, said each university that
receives state funding is asked
to give a 30-minute testimony
to the committee after Snyder
releases the state budget pro-
posal. The presidents of Grand
Valley State University, Saginaw
State University and Michigan
Technological University also
testified.
In her 10-page remark, Cole-
man also highlighted the Uni-
versity's changes in financial
aid investments to increase the
amount of grant money provid-
ed to students.
"As a result of these invest-
ments, most students with fam-
ily incomes up to $80,000 who
have financial need, pay less
today to attend U-M than they
did in 2005-06," Coleman said
to the committee. "Less. That's
not a misstatement."

A gift for the future
Dow Chemical's grant promotes sustainability
U niversity President Mary Sue Coleman and Andrew Liv-
eris, CEO of Dow Chemical Company, announced a new
sustainability fellowship on Monday that will be funded by
Dow Chemical to support sustainable research at the University. Dow
Chemical's gift of $10 million will be used over a period of six years to
bring a wide variety of academic leaders to our campus with the hopes
of creating solutions and promoting sustainability across the globe.
Though Dow Chemical has contributed to pollution in the past, the
Dow Sustainability Fellows Program will help to clean up our environ-
ment. More companies should take part in these types of programs as
our society continues to search for more green technology.

Uphold affirmative action

nFeb. 20,theSupreme Court
announced that it would
hear Fisherv. University of
Texas, the most
recent affirma-
tive action case
to be reviewed
by the Supreme
Court since the
2003 Grutter v.
Bollinger case
involving the SARAH
University. With ROHAN
conservative
Supreme Court
justices in the majority, it's likely that
the court will overrule the Grutter
decision, which affirmed the consti-
tutionality of considering race as a
factor in college admissions. Howev-
er, to do so would be a grave mistake
on the part of the court and would
undoubtedlydeprive schools, likeour
own, of the diverse environment that
attracts many of us to the institution
in the first place.
The 2003 Supreme Court ruling
involved two suits filed against the
University concerning its affirma-
tive action policies. In Grutter v. Bol-
linger, the plaintiff alleged that she
was excluded from the University's
Law School because of a policy that
considered race in admissions. The
second case, Gratz v. Bollinger, was a
class action lawsuit challenging the
University's undergraduate point
system, which assigned points in
favor of an applicant's racial minor-
ity status. Both cases contended
that the University's policies denied
equal protection of the law under
the 14th Amendment. The court,
in Gratz, ultimately found the Uni-
versity's point admission system
unconstitutional, but upheld the
constitutionality of the consider-
ation of race as an admissions factor
in Grutter.
As a Texas resident and former
prospective student of the Univer-
sity of Texas, I am personally famil-
iar not only with the admissions
policies of the school, but also with
the highly charged opinions regard-
ing those policies. Though I support

affirmative action, I disagree with
some of the admissions practices of
UT's undergraduate school.
As a race-neutral way of promot-
ing a diverse studentbody, the Texas
Legislature passed a "top 10 percent
rule" in 1997. The legislation man-
dated that every public university
in Texas automatically accept high-
school students who were in the
top 10 percent of their graduating
class, regardless of a school's overall
academic performance or of a stu-
dent's standardized test scores. (As
of 2011, the legislation was modified
to require the university to accept
only the top 8 percent automatically,
thereby freeing spots for students to
be admitted under the school's dis-
cretionary admissions.)
UT reserves 90 percent of its
spots for in-state students, 81 per-
cent of which were comprised of
students admitted as part of the top
10 percent rule in 2008. Though the
law increased minority presence on
campus, it did so only marginally.
In 2005, after the Grutter decision,
UT altered its admissions criteria
for the non-top 10 percent portion
of its class to include race as a fac-
tor in admissions.
In Fisher, the plaintiff did not
challenge the top 10 percent rule
- she contended that UT's consid-
eration of race among the non-top
10 percent applicants is unconstitu-
tional. Fisher attacked UT's discre-
tionary admissions program but not
the top 10 percent rule. In my view,
however, it is the top 10 percent rule
that needs to be revisited, while the
discretionary admissions policy
should be upheld.
Not only does the top 10 per-
cent rule discourage students from
attending competitive high schools
in favor of schools where they could
more likely land in the top 10 per-
cent, it also discourages students
from taking a challenging course
load which might lower their GPAs.
The policy also fails to achieve its
intended purpose of encouraging
diversity on campus.
The entering freshman class of
EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS:

2004, prior to the addition of the
affirmative action component to
admissions in 2005, had only 275
African-American students and
1,024 Hispanic students ina class of
6,796 students. In 2008, three years
after UT renewed its Grutter-type
admissions policy, the enrollment
jumped to 335 African-American
students and 1,228 Hispanic stu-
dents in the entering freshman
class.
Race should be
able to play a role
in admissions.
The practice of admitting stu-
dents based solely on their high-
school rankings largely ignores the
student as an individual. UT's dis-
cretionary admissions process is one
that considers a student's entire aca-
demic profile, personality, practices,
background, and, yes, race.
In Fisher, the Supreme Court will
effectively be ruling on the constitu-
tionality of Grutter-type consider-
ation of race in college admissions.
If it invalidates such considerations,
racial diversity on this campus and
campuses nationwide will be severe-
ly impacted for the worse.
In Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's
majority opinion in Grutter, she
wrote, "We expect that 25 years
from now, the use of racial prefer-
ences will no longer be necessary
to further the interest approved
today." It's been only nine years
since Grutter, and if the minority-
population statistics at the UT at
Austin are any indication, we have
many years to go before achieving
meaningful racial diversity in high-
er education.

This fellowship will be focused on sustain-
ability issues ranging from climate change to
energy use, and will work toward proactive
solutions to truly make an impact. At Mon-
day's announcement, Liveris said fellows "will
be inspired to work together as they would in
the real world to develop concrete solutions,
actionable solutions to how we can all live
cleaner ... and greener." The Dow Sustainabil-
ity Fellows Program will not just focus on one
graduate program at the University but unite
many programs to work together.
Though this money is a small amount when
compared to funded University research as
a whole, Dow Chemical's gift of $10 million
will still support important research. Sustain-
able research in today's world is necessary and
meaningful, as issues such as climate change,
water resources, housing, transportation and
energy use plague our society. The need for
sustainable resources and a cleaner future can-
not be ignored, and with the money from Dow
Chemical, this greener future may become a
reality due to research at the University.
While Dow's gift provides great opportuni-
ties and hopeful solutions, the company should
continue to play an active role in the commu-
nity and take part in this movement by doing
more than just donating money. The company
has a sordid past of abusing the environment,

and it should pursue other ways of improving
its practices.
The Dow Sustainability Fellows Program
will also unite a diverse, scholarly group of stu-
dents from all disciplines. Graduate students in
the areas of public policy, chemistry, econom-
ics and law will all come together to solve the
long term problems our society faces. By bring-
ing together such a wide group of academic
leaders, success and sustainable energy solu-
tions are only imminent.
Respected universities, such as Carnegie
Mellon University and Harvard University,
already have funded sustainability fellowships
and are moving toward greener solutions. It's
about time the University starts playing a big-
ger role in this active movement toward a more
sustainable future as well. We are a leading
research institute with the talented students,
staff and funding to truly make an impact in
our society.
The Dow Sustainability Fellows Program
will not only unite a group of talented indi-
viduals from various disciplines and fields
of study, but will also make the University a
forerunner in the research and promotion of
sustainable energy. Through Dow Chemical's
$10 million gift, our University will be able
to make huge strides toward a greener, more
efficient future.

VANESSA RYCHLINSKI I
An invisible band-aid

iat's an exciting time to be on
campus. The sun is shining,
the LSA Course Guide has been

Noticing my own privilege is important to
me. Unfortunately, due to those same privileg-
es, it's not something I do often. My problems
are first-world, and nightmares arise out of my
own imagination.
Pamela Reynolds, an ethnographer of chil-
dren in war and professor emeritus at Johns
Hopkins University, writes of the difficulties
of conveying the truth of war, especially when
children are involved. She questions the cred-
ibility of today's documentation of war; how
the history of war, "including children's role in
it, is written;" and finally, how "[war's] effects
on the young [is] measured and weighed."
Invisible Children's Kony 2012 video has
gone viral. In the beginning, it basically com-
pares itself to other banal bits of broadband,
such as videos of babies with kittens and medi-
cal miracles. Jason "my middle name is Radi-
cal" Russell, the narrator of the video and one
of the founders of Invisible Children, eases into
a meandering milieu of shallow topics in order
to soften the segue into the atrocities of the
developing world. In what seems like a home
movie reel of his blonde son, Russell finally
gets to the matter at hand, atrocities against
children, by inserting some slick graphics and
telling the viewer that "these kids are just like
Gavin." And so the infantilizing, cheap paral-
lels continue for 30 minutes, leaving me with
questions. Do people really need to be babied
into believing in the massive amounts of vio-
lence currently taking place? Do they need
comparisons with cute American kids in order
to care, shots of happy crowds shouting for jus-
tice in order to join the throng?
Invisible Children has come under fire for
everything from its use of funds to its choice
of friends. With more than $13 million in
donations, and about $9 million in expenses -
including salaries and production equipment
- the organization gave out only a fifth of this
to direct services. The policy journal Foreign
Affairs wrote that Invisible Children "manip-
ulates facts for strategic purposes." A March
8 article in The Telegraph has quoted Ugan-
dan journalists and bloggers calling the video
"highly irresponsible" and counterproductive
to effecting positive change in the region. An
opposing movement called Visible Children
publicized its counterpart's support of the
Ugandan government and the Sudan People's
Liberation Army, two entities with no small
amount of blood on their own hands.

The video had 75 million view in one week,
and viewers are getting the message and hope-
fully getting motivated. A March 13 article in
the New York Times praises the video for sum-
moning the heretofore "untapped power of
the viewer." But if this is true, then the world's
greatest tragedies must need to be handed to
us stylishly, in streamlined snippets that cut
apart anything resembling the true horror of
the situation.
Maybe it's the prerogative of a filmmaker to
convey material in the way that will evoke the
most emotion in the most people. But it must
be mentioned that donors to Invisible Children
receive a "Kony 2012 Action Kit" complete
with t-shirt, bracelet, posters, stickers and the
instructions to "decorate [themselves] and the
town." The organization basically directs its
audience to participate in a stylish marketing
campaign. It seems to me that this initiative
does not complete any action outside of easing
the conscience of the privileged.
Winston Kelly, a senior studying behavioral
psychology at the University, called the Kony
2012 awareness campaign "fighting a fire with
a super-soaker."
"Empirical studies have shown awareness
campaigns do not result in behavior change at
any statistically meaningful level," Kelly says.
"People consider the knowledge of the issue as
the first step, but so few people take step two or
step three."
Don't let Kony 2012 fool you. Despite its
not-for-profit status, Invisible Children is a
business like any other. If you give a compa-
ny a vote of confidence in the shape of a dollar
sign, it will most certainly want to keep up
the conversation.
The world needs to get going on its own
conversation. Violence against the defense-
less is one of the deepest evils. That being
said, taking advantage of kids on any level
through any means is wrong. Watching
Kony 2012 may force you to check your prem-
ises, shock you with a nightmarish truth and
cause you see the disturbingly expansive map
of your own privilege. All of these things are
unbelievably important. But donating money
to Invisible Children for the sake of "aware-
ness" doesn't seem to do much but provide
consumer satisfaction.

book events to vote for so-and-so
party. In the past, it was a campaign
between just two parties.
But this year, there are six candi-
dates vying for president and vice
president. Six. This in and of itself is
a reason to pay attention more than
in past years. It's not just the increase
in political parties. The historical
moment we live in demands action,
and we, the student body, must
answer the call.
As someone who knows nearly
each of them personally, all of the
candidates are qualified for the posi-
tion, and I give them my respect. And
yet, next week, students will be faced
with a choice.
We can choose to pick a slate that
prioritizes fighting for social justice
and progressive change or one that
believes that student government
should remain a static institution and
pursue small goals that are promised
to students nearly every election.
There is only one truly progressive
slate that has proven that they know
how to and are committed to creat-
ing change: Kevin Mersol-Barg and
Amy Navvab with OurMichigan. As
student leaders within CSG and LSA
Student Government, as well as other
organizations, they have a broad
range of experiences and connec-
tions with student activism.
Trust me, student government
is the last thing I thought I would
care about when I got to college. My

experience with student govern-
ment before coming to Ann Arbor
was lackluster. Every year, the popu-
lar kids won, usually by promising
French fries and ice cream in the caf-
eteria and more time for lunch. And
every year, come lunchtime, I was
disappointed with their failure.
The issue boils down to the fact
that often times, what the adminis-
tration wants and what the student
body wants are in direct conflict. In
reality, high-school students have
limited power and can be easily con-
trolledby the administration because
they don't know better.
But, news flash: we are not in high
school anymore.
The power of students has been
repeatedly demonstrated on univer-
sity campuses. Students have a long
track record of fighting for social jus-
tice here at home and elsewhere. In
just the past two years, we've played
major roles in the Occupy movement
and the fight against massive govern-
ment cuts.
The fight is not over; in fact, it's
just beginning.
Over the past 10years, Lansing has
cut 29 percent of higher education
funding. As a result of these short-
sighted cuts as well as the admin-
istration's allocation of billions for
construction projects, the average
tuition for public state universities
has increased by 87 percent in the
past decade.As I wrote last month,
the diversity of this institution has
drastically dropped. For example,
while 14 percent of Michigan's resi-
dents are black, they make up only
4.4 percent of campus, down from
7.3 percent in 2006. But these are just
two of many other issues that our
administration needs to address.We
need a student government that will
make these social justice issues cen-
tral to its agenda. We need a student
government that's not afraid to stand
up to the administration when we,
the students, know it's in the wrong.
Mersol-Barg helped found the
Coalition for Tuition Equality, the

most exciting social justice initia-
tive on campus since I've been here.
With more than a dozen of the most
influential student organizations
involved, it's undergone a campaign
to achieve in-state tuition for quali-
fied undocumented immigrants.
Mersol-Barg has been at the fore-
front, planning actions and organiz-
ing long-term strategy.
OurMichigan is
the best choice
for 'U' students.
Navvab has her own coalition.
As chair of the Open Housing Ini-
tiative, she's working to allow
students to choose roommates
regardless of gender identity and
gender expression. This initiative,
the first broad-based campaign for
social justice I experienced on cam-
pus, has already been successful in
expanding the housing options for
all students and continues to work
with administration.
But look no further than the Uni-
versity Board of Regents meeting
today to see how they, in participat-
ing in the action planned by Coalition
for Tuiton Equality and eRACism,
are demonstrating for fair tuition
policies and a diverse campus.
For social change to be most suc-
cessful on this campus, we need
executives willing to stand and act
with us.
Next Wednesday and Thursday, I
urge you to vote for those who want
meaningful social change on this
campus. I urge you to vote for Kevin
Mersol-Barg, Amy Navaab and Our-
Michigan.

Ravi may be
charged with
hate crimes after
roommate's suicide
NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J.
(AP) - After nearly two weeks
of testimony, the case that kick-
started national conversations
about gay youths and Internet
privacy was sent yesterda to a
jury that must decide whether a
former Rutgers University stu-
dent is a criminal or just a young
man who was confused by see-
ing two men kiss.
Dharun Ravi, now 20, is
accused of viewing a few sec-
onds of his roommate's intimate
encounter with another man in
their dorm room at Rutgers and
telling people about it in text
messages, tweets and in person.
He could face years in prison
if convicted of charges includ-
ing invasion of privacy and bias
intimidation, a hate crime.
Lawyers gave their summa-
tionsTuesdayin the case, which
has gotten enormous attention
since the events of Septem-
ber 2010, when the roommate,
Tyler Clementi, jumped to his
death from the George Wash-
ington Bridge.
The trial, which included tes-
timony from about 30 witnesses
over 12 days in addition to the
closing arguments, focused on a
few days inthe dormwhere Ravi
and Clementi, both 18-year-olds
from well-off New Jersey sub-
urbs, were randomly assigned
to be first-year roommates.
Defense attorney Steven Alt-
man told jurors that Ravi was
surprised to turn on his web-

cam and see his roommate in an
intimate situation with another
man. He emphasized that there
was no recording, no broadcast
and no YouTube video of the
Sept. 19,t2010, encounter.
And he said Ravi was not act-
ing out of hatred of his room-
mate or gays in general when he
saw the image from his webcam
on the computer of another stu-
dent.
"If there's hate in Dharun's
heart, if there's ugliness in Dha-
run's heart, where's there some
information and some evidence
to support it?" Altman asked
jurors.
Ravi tweeted and talked
about what he saw, but Alt-
man said lie was only doing
so because he was young, had
never before seen men kissing
and did not know what to do.
He'd turned on the webcam
in the first place, Altman said,
because he was worried about
what was happening in his
room after seeing Clementi's
guest, whom Ravi described as
"older" and "sketchy."
His client, Altman said, was
concerned about whether the
stranger might take the Pad
he'd left in the room.
Julia McClure, a prosecutor
for Middlesex County, remind-
ed jurors of testimony from
some of Ravi's high school
friends that even before Ravi
moved into the dorm, he was
concerned about having a gay
roommate.
"He was so shocked that
within about four minutes, he
sent out a tweet, because he
was seeking advice?" McClure
asked. And, she said, there was
evidence that he then told other
students about what he'd seen

and invited them to a friend's
room where they could see for
themselves.
The challenge for jurors
could be deciding whether
the laws apply to what Ravi is
alleged to have done.
He faces 15 charges. Four are
invasion of privacy and attempt-
ed invasion of privacy charges,
where the required proof is that
he saw or disseminated images
- or attempted to - of private
parts or sex acts, or a situation
where someone might reason-
ably expect to see them.
Four charges allege bias
intimidation. Ravi can be con-
victed of intimidation if he's
also found guilty of an underly-
ing invasion-of-privacy charge.
Two of those charges are sec-
ond-degree crimes punishable
by up to 10 years in prison - the
most significant penalties he
faces if convicted.
Seven charges accuse him
of trying to cover his tracks.
Among the allegations: that he
deleted and changed Twitter
postings and text messages and
told another witness what to
say.
Clementi's death was one in
a string of suicides by young
gays around the country in Sep-
tember 2010 and became prob-
ably the best known. President
Barack Obama commented on
it in an online video, as did talk
show host Ellen DeGeneres.
New Jersey lawmakers has-
tened passage of an anti-bul-
lying law because of the case,
and Rutgers changed housing
policies to allow opposite-sex
roommates in an effort to make
a more comfortable environ-
rment for lesbian, gay, bisexual
and transgender students.

Fraternity to
relocate to building
on corner of Tappan
and Hill Streets
By LIANA ROSENBLOOM
Daily StaffReporter
After 22 years of housing
complications and four reloca-
tions over the past 12 years, the
Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity is
looking forward to finally mov-
ing into a permanent home this
fall.
The brothers officially final-
ized the purchase of Memo-
rial Christian Church, located
at the corner of Tappan Avenue
and Hill Street, and renovations
began at the end of January.
According to Jerry Mangona,
president of Sig Ep's Michigan
Alpha Alumni Board, the fra-
ternity has long struggled to
overcome complications with its
housing.
Mangona said Memorial
Christian Church approached
Sig Ep's real estate agent after
making plans to relocate in
order to accommodate for its
growing congregation. After
nearly two years of negotiation
and hearings before the Ann
Arbor Zoning Board of Appeals,
a sale price was agreed on last
summer. The total cost of the
project, including renovations,
will be more than $3 million.
"Financing the project was
complex in an environment
where banks are risk-averse,
especially for a construction
project," Mangona said.
He added that renovations
will include the conversion of
old office spaces into bedrooms
and other areas into study space,
a social and dining area, and a
room to formally display chapter
memorabilia and awards.
Mangona said closing on the
property involved cooperation
from the Bank of Ann Arbor,
BB&T Bank and the Sig Ep hous-
ing corporation, adding that
more than $700,000 in pledges
from alumni are helping finance
the renovation.
Phoenix Contractors is han-
dling the construction and its
scheduled to be complete late
this summer, Mangona said.
Hobbs + Black Architects,
founded by William S. Hobbs, a
Sig Ep alum and 1958 University
graduate, has been contracted
for project design.
Kinesiology sophomore
Michael Freedman, president
of Sigma Phi Epsilon, said the
brothers are thankful for their
current home, but the space is
not sufficient. He said there is
very little common living space
and the setup is not conducive to
hosting parties.
Freedman added that once
renovations are complete on the
church, it will house 44 Sig Ep
brothers and one resident schol-
ar. He asserted that no exter-
nal changes will be made to the
church.
"I'm very excited about it and
I know the rest of the guys are
too," he said. "We, as a fraterni-

ty, have been hearing about this
for years."
Freedman said anticipation
about the new house is mount-
ing, especially now that con-
struction has begun. He added

that he is proud that the fra-
ternity is the second largest on
campus and said lie has high
hopes for the fraternity's prog-
ress once it has a place to call
home.
"Since walking by the church
and seeing the construction ...
the morale is extremely high.
The way we look at it is they
sky is the limit with an actual
home," he said.
According to Mangona, Sig Ep
surrendered its charter in Octo-
ber 1994 following sanctions
over a hazing incident.,The local
chapter still owned the house
that the fraternity had for-
merly occupied, but numerous
problems plagued the property,
including substantial inten-
tional damage and a fire in Sep-
tember 1995. The blaze, believed
to be caused by vagrants, sig-
nificantly rewduced the amount
of funding the University had
offered to pay to recover the
house from Comerica Bank.
Mangona said the Continen-
tal American Insurance Compa-
ny filed a lawsuit in 1996 against
the University, the fraternity,
fraternity alumni and the Uni-
versity's Office of Greek Life,
claiming the insurance compa-
ny had been put at "undue risk"
due to the occupants' treatment
of the house. The property has
since been demolished and is
now the site of Weill Hall, which
houses the University's Ford
School of Public Policy.
Since the fraternity, which
was founded at the University
in 1912, officially returned to
campus in 1998, brothers have
lived at four different locations,
including their current apart-
ment complex on Hill Street
that they have transformed into
a fraternity house, Mangona

said.
He added that the alumni
board recruited him in the early
2000s to find a permanent chap-
ter house, which he said was not
an easy task.
"Our biggest challenge was
finding a suitable property that
met the zoning requirement for
the city for more than six unre-
lated people to share a common
space," he said.
Mangona said concerns arose
with the Delta Delta Delta
sorority, which will be Sig Ep's
neighbors when it moves into
the new property in the fall of
2012. He added that Sig Ep has
worked closely with Jane Coo-
per, president of the House Cor-
poration of Tri Delt, to address
their concerns, which includes
headlights shining into win-
dows of the sorority's house and
Sig Ep guests cutting across the
Tri Delt property to get to the
Sig Ep house.
During an internal meeting
prior to their hearings with the
Zoning Board of Appeals, Man-
gona said documents on the
centennial history of the church
were uncovered that indicated
there was a time capsule inside.
the bronze cornerstone of the
church. A ceremony to open
the capsule will be held in early
April, involving former mem-
hers of the fraternity and the
church.
Mangona added that Sig Ep
brothers havebeen encouraged
to gather items for their own
time capsule, which they also
plan to create at this time.
"The conversations have all
been very fruitful and amicable,
and we are looking forward to
continuing to build a relation-
ship with our neighbors," Man-
gona said.

SAM DEAN/AP
Celeste Peterson, mother of shooting victim Erin Perterson, right, cries after a verdict yesterday,
Jury rules on the handling of
2007 gunmanbVirgina Tech

Lawsuit final
litigation in
shootings
CHRISTIANSBURG, Va.
(AP) - The parents of two Vir-
ginia Tech students killed in a
2007 campus massacre worked
for years to prove university offi-
cials were negligent for waiting
to warn students of a gunman on
campus, and a jury agreed with
them yesterday.
It took jurors 3/2 hours to find
that university officials botched
their response to the April 16,
2007, massacre that left 33 peo-
ple - including the gunman -
dead. The jury determined in the
wrongful death lawsuit against
the state that the parents of Julia
Pryde and Erin Peterson each
deserved $4 million. The award
likely will be sharply reduced
because Virginia law requires
such awards to be capped at
$100,000.
The lawsuit was the last pend-
ing litigation over the mass

shootings and it's not clear if any
additional lawsuits will be filed.
The state is expected to appeal
the verdict, as it did a separate
fine handed down by federal
education officials. No crimi-
nal charges were brought in the
shootings.
"We were looking for truth for
a long time," Harry Pryde said
outside the courthouse that's less
than 10 miles from Tech's Blacks-
burg campus. "We persevered
and we got some truth today."
After the verdict, the parents
said their persistence is what
their daughters would have want-
ed. They were the only eligible
families to reject their share of
an $11 million dollar settlement in
2008, instead taking the state to
court in a wrongful death lawsuit.
The $11 million settlement was
split between 24 families, exclud-
ing other disbursements such as
$1.9 million set aside in a hard-
ship fund. The state could not
immediately provide a per-family
breakdown of the settlement.
The families who sued the
state, however, said getting

answers mattered the most. They
argued that lives could have been
spared if school officials had
moved more quickly to alert the
campus after the first two victims
were shot in a dorm. The massa-
cre ended later in the morning
with the deaths of 31 more peo-
ple, including the gunman, in a
classroom building.
"When you know that some-
thing is right you're not deterred
from your course," said Celeste
Peterson, whose daughter Erin
died in the mass shooting that
was the deadliest in modern U.S.
history. "We wanted the truth
from the very beginning and we
got it. All I know is today we got
what we wanted."
The state, which was the lone
defendant in the case, argued
the university did all that it could
with the information available at
the time. President Charles W.
Steger and other university offi-
cials said they initially believed
the first two shootings were
isolated instances of domestic
violence, based on what police
investigators told them.

2002 to five in 2011.
With the national rate of
female head coaches at its high-
est this year, Pankratz remains
optimistic that the number will
continue to grow.
"I think over the years the
support for women's athletics
has grown not only emotion-
ally, but certainly financially,
and now it can be a profession
as opposed to a part-time gig,"
Pankratz said. "I think young
people can see women role mod-
els coaching, and in positions
of sports, it motivates them to
know that they can do it them-
selves as well."
The number of female athletic
administrators at the University
has also exceeded the national
average of 35.8 percent, with
females comprising 38.4 percent
of athletic administrators at the
University.
Chrissi Rawak, the senior
associate athletic director for
development at the University,
said the
University's efforts to diver-
sify its athletic administration
have caused employees to not
place a major emphasis on gen-
der in the workplace.
"(Athletic Director) Dave
(Brandon) believes in surround-
ing himselfwith people that have
diverse skills and strengths, and
that includes people that have
backgrounds that are unique and
different," Rawak said.
She added: "There are five
women around the table of
Dave's leadership team, and I
know that I replaced a man. I
don't necessarily think about
gender, I think about qualifica-
tions and experience and who is
the best person for the job."
The percentage of schools
with a full-time female sports
information director declined
this year from an average of 12.2
percent in 2004 to a current
average of 9.8 percent, accord-
ing to the study. Still, the Uni-
versity outscored the national
average, with three female
sports information directors
currently employed.
Sarah VanMetre, athletic
communications coordinator
for the women's varsity softball
and volleyball teams, said she
does not notice any discrimina-
tion as a woman holding an SID
position.
"I was a student athlete
myself," VanMetre said. "So I
feel that is my biggest identi-
\fier in this position - never my
gender."
The record high numbers for
women's participation in sports
this year have sparked excite-
ment around the nation as
female participation and equal-
ity continues to grow, Pankratz
said.
"The young women who
participate now, they have no
idea what the women in the 70s
and 80s went through so they
could be afforded these oppor-
tunities," Pankratz said. "Now
these kids feel even, and they
expect it to be even, and that's
what we were fighting for the
whole time. I think that's a cool
thing, the way that it's expect-
ed by these young kids coming
in that it's going to be fair, and
even, and that there will be

opportunities." a

'M' remembers late-season loss

Michigan's journey to
the NCAA Tourney

By MICHAEL LAURILA
Daily Sports Writer
When the Michigan women's
basketball team tips off against
Oklahoma in its NCAA Tourna-
ment first-round game on Sunday,
it will have been 4,018 days (10
years and 363 days to be exact)
since the Wolverines last danced.
In 2001, then-coach Sue
Guevara led Michigan to its
second-consecutive berth. The
Wolverines have been searching
for a chance to dance ever since.
The journey has been long. It's
seen many different faces, includ-
ing three coaches, and two differ-
ent athletic directors. Most teams
can detail their road to March
in a season but Michigan's road
to March is a bit longer and has
more than a few details.
Michigan women's basketball
B.K.B (before Kevin Borseth):
When Guevara arrived in Ann
Arbor in 1996, the Wolverines
hadn't had a date to the dance
since 1990 - the program's first-
ever bid. Shetook Michiganto the
NCAA Tournament in her second
season, only to suffer a first-round
loss to UCLA.
Following another first-round
loss to Stanford in 2000, the Wol-
verines got over the hump a year
later and defeated Virginia in the
opening round. It was only the
second time Michigan had ever
gone further than the first round
in the program's history - 1990
beingthe first.
With three NCAA tournament
berths in four years, it seemed
Guevara had changed the atmo-
sphere of the women's program.
The Wolverines hadn't previously
been known as an elite program,
but Guevara had made them just
that - one of the Big Ten's best, a
team where NCAA Tournament
appearances were the norm.
But the wheels came off
the wagon the next two years.
Between 2002 and 2004, Guevara
compiled a 30-29 regular-season
record, and the team was 9-23 in
conference play. Guevara left the
program following an abysmal
2003 collapse in conference play.
Just as it had appeared that
Guevara had turned Michigan
into a program where an NCAA
Tournament berth was expected,
Cheryl Burnett, who was the next
coach to lead the Wolverines,
found otherwise.
The Missouri native, who'd
brought Southwest Missouri
State to glory during her 15 years
there - earning 10 NCAA Tour-
nament berths and two Final
Four appearances - wanted to do
similar things for the Wolverines.
In her inaugural press confer-
ence, Burnett talked about how
proud she was to be the coach
of such a prestigious university
"where academics are the foun-
dation of athletics."
Not only did Burnett not find
similar success as Guevara at
Michigan, she barely found any at
all. After four seasons as Michi-
gan's coach, she'd compiled a
35-83 record and never took the
Wolverines to the postseason. She
abruptly retired from coaching
following the 2007 season.
The early Borseth years:
Borseth took over a program
that had suffered five consecutive

losing seasons and didn't seem to
be making any progress towards
achieving the success it had in the
early2000s.Michiganwent10-44
in Big Ten play during Burnett's
four-year tenure, and the Wolver-
ines were considered one of the
weakest teams in the conference.
Borseth had a solid reputation as
a hard-nosed yet warm-hearted
coach, who'd experienced much
success at Wisconsin-Green Bay.
During his nine-year stint, he
took the Phoenix to seven NCAA
Tournaments and compiled a 216-
62 overall record.
A native of Bessemer, Mich.,
Borseth felt comfortable coming
back to Michigan to coach. He'd
previously coached for 11 seasons
at Michigan Tech from 1987-1998
and had experience recruiting
within the state and the Midwest.
After Burnett went 10-20 in her
final season, it seemed likely that
whoever took the reins would see
a similar losing record in their
opening season. But Borseth
made an immediate impact. The
Wolverines overachieved and fin-

ished the year at 19-13, advancing
all the way to the quarterfinals of
the WNIT. His predictions also
held true in his second season:
the second year was the toughest.
Michigan finished 10-20 on the
year and 3-15 in the Big Ten.
So close, but so far:
Following the atrocious 2008-
2009 season, 2009-2010 found
the Wolverines as the preseason
favorite to finish in the cellar of
the Big Ten. Borseth reiterated
the predictions he'd made during
his inaugural press conference
and the struggles of rebuilding a
program.
Borseth's vision revealed itself
in 2010, as Michigan finished
17-13 following the Big Ten Tour-
nament. ESPN bracketologist
Charlie Creme had the Wolver-
ines as one of the last teams in the
NCAA Tournament before Selec-
tion Monday.
But likely due to Michigan's
meek 8-10 Big Ten record and
sixth-place conference finish,
Creme's predictions turned out
faulty and the Wolverines found
themselves in the WNIT. The
team made a surprising run to the
semifinals, only to be-defeated at
the hands of Miami (Fla).
A year later, Michigan found
itself in a similar position late in
the season. The Wolverines went
into Selection Monday at 17-12,
with a 4-5 record against top-25
teams, and they beat ranked Ohio
State twice. Unlike 2010, Michi-
gan finished 10-6, en route to a
third-place finish in the confer-
ence, and the team felt it had done
enough to make its first NCAA
appearance since 2001.
Once again, Creme had the
Wolverines dancing and pegged
as a 10-seed - not even one of
the last four in. But Michigan
didn't receive a bid to dance and
settled for another WNIT berth.
The Wolverines played all of their
games on the road because of con-
struction to Crisler Arena, and in
doing so, suffered a first-round
loss to low-seeded Eastern Michi-
gan.
The Journey Ends:
Coming into this season in his
fifth year at the helm, Borseth
finally had four classes that were
his own recruiting concoctions.
The experienced roster, which
lost only one player to graduation,
looked ready to make it over the
hump and finally dance.
The Wolverines lost to Ohio
State in the second-round of the
Big Ten Tournament, but had an
RPI of 44. They felt they'd done
enough, once again But Creme,
who'd put the Wolverines into
the tournament the previous two
years in his predictions, had them
the second team out.
When the field of 66 was
announced this past Monday and
Michigan's name popped up as
an 11-seed in Norman, Okla., it
seemed that Borseth's plans since
his arrival had finally come to
fruition.
"When our name came on that
screen, that room just explod-
ed," Borseth said following the
announcement. "The committee
has tough decisions to make, and
the last couple of years we weren't
on the positive end of that choice,
and this year we were. Whatever
the reason, I don't know, but I'm

glad we were."
It might have taken five years
to get the Wolverines to dance,
but they're there, and they're
looking to stay for the long haul.
As one of the team's leaders,
Boylan felt the team's frustration
about not being able to close out
games as a freshman and when
the team was snubbed by the
committee later in her career. But
she has finally been rewarded for
her determination and dedication
in her final season at Michigan.
In the same way that the
Michigan men's basketball team's
seniors Stu Douglass and Zach
Novak are the building blocks
for the current team, Boylan and
senior guard Carmen Reynolds
are the cornerstones for the Wol-
verines' present and future suc-
cess.
"Our program has changed so
much since coach Borseth came
here and (the seniors and I) were
a part of his recruiting class,"
Boylan said on Tuesday. "To be
able to leave our footprint on the
program means so much to us."

Jon Merrill was furious with
himself. The sophomore defense-
man hit his stick against the ice
in frustration
after his late- NOTEBOOK
game turnover
against Bowling Green cost the
Michigan hockey team the game.
Three weeks ago, the Wolver-
ines were still battling for first
place in the CCHA, and the loss to
last-place Bowling Green knocked
them out of the race. Merrill was
less than pleased.
Well, cheer up, Mr. Merrill.
It turns out that loss was a good
thing.
"It was big for us to really lose
to them," said senior forward
David Wohlberg. "I think in (that)
game when we lost to them, that
really opened our eyes to how
good of a team they were.
"Now we know what we have
to do to go and win against them
this time."
Michigan will play Bowling
Green - this year's Cinderella
team in the conference playoffs -
on Friday in the CCHA semifinals.
After defeating Lake Superior
State in the first round, the Fal-
cons shocked top-seeded Ferris
State in the quarterfinals.
With the rest of the CCHA
apparently sleeping on the Fal-
cons, some Michigan players have
taken to something seemingly
absurd:they're singingthe praises
of their loss.
"Even though that was a big
loss for us, it prepared us for every
series," said freshman forward
Alex Guptill. "I don't think we'd
do as well in the Notre Dame
series if we don't lose that game
against Bowling Green."
Bowling Green overcame a
three-goal deficit on Sunday
against the Bulldogs to win the
deciding game in overtime.

Sophomore defenseman Jon Merrill had a crucial turnover late in Michigan's lo

force of 6557 newtons.
Given that you can under-
stand the difficulty in getting
hockey players to block shots.
The problem is, Michigan coach
Red Berenson knows that cham-
pionship teams block shots. So,
recently Berenson and the rest of
the coaching staff have begun a
shot-blocking initiative.
First, it was the plastic pucks.
Freshman forward Phil Di
Giuseppe said the plastic pucks
appeared a month ago during
practice at Yost Ice Arena. They
were meant to ease the team in to
getting in front of pucks without
the risk of injury. The timing isn't
a coincidence. About a month ago,
Berenson spent part of his Valen-
tine's Day watching the Rangers
play the Bruins and was inspired.
"One night,, I was watch-
ing Carl (Hagelin) play with the
Rangers," Berenson said. "(Rang-
ers coach) John Tortorella, he
made it very clear, he said 'If you
don't block 'blank' shots, you don't
'blank' play. Period.' And that was
a message for the whole team.
And that's how I feel. I didn't like

blocking shots, but you can learn
how to do it."
According to Berenson, there
are three parts to blocking a shot:
skill, timing and will.
Some players have the skill.
Berenson lists senior forward
Luke Glendening, senior defen-
seman Greg Pateryn, sophomore
forward Derek DeBlois and junior
forward Kevin Lynch among the
team's best blockers.
Next, the timing: The plastic
pucks in practice have evolved to
regular pucks, and Michigan now
regularly runs a blocking drill
during practices. Two players
move the puck at the blue line, and
two other skaters have to block
the puck before it's put on net.
Finally, the will. A few weeks
ago, the team watched what fifth-
year senior goalie Shawn Hun-
wick called a "little highlight tape
of missed blocks that led to goals."
And Berenson has continued
to drive the message home. In
his post-game speech to his play-
ers after the Notre Dame series,
Berenson praised his shot block-
ers, later noting that Pateryn took

a particularly painful shot off the
arm. And just in case that wasn't
enough, he also had a doozy of a
story up his sleeve.
"I told them the story of Al
Arbour," said Berenson, referring
to his former teammate on the St.
Louis Blues. "This was the days of
no helmets, and he wore glasses
during the games. And Bobby
Hull would come down the wing
- and Bobby Hull had the best
shot in the league - and he would
rear back and he would rip it. And
Al Arbour would go down with
the glasses on, and he would block
that shot.
"Between periods, they would
take his shin pad off and they
would stitch up his shins ... And so
he'd go back out, and Hull would
come down again, and Arbour
would go down. And we would all
be on the bench just flinching for
him. And nobody would every say
a wrong word about Al Arbour.
"And so I'm telling them: if he
could block shots wearing glasses,
you could sure as hell block shots
wearing a full facemask and the
equipment you've got on."

Wolverines have done their job

Three-hundred and sixty
one days ago when Mich-
igan got bounced by Duke
in the third round of the NCAA
Tournament, fans were alright
with that.
Sure, it
would've
been nice
to knock off
a top seed,
but it was
understood
that there
was progressNEAL
made in the ROTHSCHILD
program.
The team
had bounced back from a year in
which stars Manny Harris and
DeShawn Sims couldn't bring
the team to the Big Dance, and
Michigan had outperformed
expectations.
The 2010-11 Wolverines were
expected to lurk in the depths of
the Big Ten standings, but they
instead got hot in the second
half and tied for fourth. This got
them into the NCAA Tourna-
ment, where they defiled Tennes-
see before the Blue Devils got by
them. So, naturally, in the name
of progress, Michigan would take
it a step further and make the
Sweet 16 this year, right?
Well, maybe right. But it's not
so simple. The NCAA Tourna-
ment is a strange beast.
March Madness is fun and
all, but it's not the best way to
find out who the best team is.
So much about the tournament
comes down to matchups and
officiating and lucky breaks that
it takes more than just a good
team to survive and advance.
Virginia Commonwealth made
the Final Four last year as an
11-seed. And not only were the
Rams an 11-seed, but they had to
win a play-in game to even earn
the right to take on the six-seed
in the second round.
Which do you trust more to
tell you which teams are good, a
30-plus game schedule or a six-
game tournament?
I say these things not to slam

SOFTBALL
Michigan heads to
California to end
tournament season

Michigan coach John Beilein has led Michigan toa second-consecutive berth in the NCAA Tournament.

the NCAA Tournament - it's
the best thing going in sports -
but because Michigan will get
wrongly criticized if it fails to
make the Sweet 16, and espe-
cially if it fails to make the third
round.
Michigan coach John Beilein
has already done his job this year.
He did more than bring Michi-
gan back to the tournament. He
won a Big Ten Championship and
brought the team to its highest
(non-vacated) NCAA Tourna-
ment seed since Trey Burke was
an infant. But beyond any of
these 2011-12 accomplishments,
he brought an air of permanence
to Michigan basketball. By land-
ing then-No. 2 recruit Mitch
McGary, Beilein established that
this was a school whose success
wasn't going to ebb and flow.
It would remain constant, year
after year.
No coach in today's college
basketball climate can enter a
season with the sole intent of
winning a national champion-
ship. The best that they can do is
be in the mix every year, so when
things break right, that team will
be in position to take advantage.

The only way to win the lot-
tery is to have a ticket. And the
more lottery tickets you have, the
more likely you are to get lucky.
This year, Beilein made strides
in building Michigan into a
machine that can eventually pro-
duce its own lottery tickets. Once
a school gets to that point, it's
only a matter of time before the
lottery bell chimes. I'll pretend
that's a real thing. Take Kansas,
who hadn't won a championship
since 1988 despite consistently
being a top seed in the NCAA
Tournament. No one doubted
that this was a top program and
things eventually turned out
right when Bill Self took the Jay-
hawks to a title in 2008.
Michigan may not get to the
point where it's a perennial top
seed, but even if it's in the three-
to-ten seed range for enough
years, things tend to work out.
One year, the Wolverines will
make the Elite Eight, and maybe
the Final Four. Maybe even the
National Championship.
On Friday, Michigan will face
Ohio and the pressure will be on.
The Wolverines are favored to
win, and there will be backlash

if they don't. There will be back-
lash if they don't win the game
after.
But the truth is, the NCAA
Tournament doesn't care.
Michigan may lose to Ohio, but it
doesn't mean that the Wolverines
weren't good enough to make the
Elite Eight if they were put on a
different side of the bracket. So
much is left up to chance.
The Harvard College Sports
Analysis Collective determined
that the Bobcats had a 55-per-
cent chance of knocking off the
Wolverines. How does that make
sense when it's Michigan seeded
nine spots higher?
It doesn't, and so it shouldn't
make sense that the NCAA Tour-
nament would decide the best
team. And so it also makes no
sense to judge Michigan based
on its March performance - no
matter how big the stage is.
Beilein has handled what is con-
trollable, and that's been to bring
Michigan to a position where it
can contend in March for years
to come.

After playing in Louisiana,
Kentucky and Florida during
the early regular season this
year, the Michigan softball team
will travel to California for one
last tournament before Big Ten
play begins.
The 19th-ranked Wolverines
will be competing in their sixth
tournament of the season on
Thursday.
The team will travel to Ful-
lerton, Calif. to play in the Judi
Garman Classic for the seventh-
straight year.
Michigan (16-7) has posted
a 4-1 record in each of the last
four years at this tournament
and a 21-9 mark all-time.
Coming off of a disappointing
1-2 performance at the Red and
Black Tournament in Louisville,
Kent., the Wolverines are look-
ing to bounce back.
Just as it has in other tour-
naments, Michigan will play at
least one top-25 team. After los-
ing 2-1 last week to then-No. 16
Louisville, the Wolverines will
play No. 7 Oklahoma, No. 5 Ari-
zona State, and No. 24 DePaul,
in addition to unranked Notre
Dame and Virginia.
Arizona State (25-2) stands as
the highest-ranked foe Michi-
gan will have played this season.
A reason for the Sun Devils' suc-
cess has been senior shortshop
Katelyn Boyd, who is the reign-
ing Pac-12 Player of the Week,
in part because of her current
16-game hitting streak.
This weekend's tournament
marks the first time this season
that the Wolverines will play a
top-10 opponent and more than
two ranked teams in one tour-
nament.

The Wolverines will start off
against Notre Dame and senior
infielder Dani Miller during
their first game on Thursday.
The last time Michigan played
the Fighting Irish was in the
2011 NCAA Regional, when the
Wolverines scored six runs in
the last two innings to defeat
Notre Dame, 9-8.
Such an offensive outburst
would bode well for Michigan,
as they haven't had as many
"quality at-bats" recently as
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins
would like.
The Wolverines are 13-0 in
games where they have record-
ed more hits than their opposi-
tion and 3-7 when they haven't.
An additional means of moti-
vation for the Wolverines comes
with Virginia.
They will play the Cavaliers
for the second time this season,
having defeated them 7-i at the
Citrus Classic in Kissimmee,
Fla. Michigan freshman pitcher
Haylie Wagner led the way with
a one-hitter during that match-
up.
Wagner will aim to have such
a performance again, after suf-
fering her second loss of the sea-
son last week against Louisville.
After Michigan completes
this tournament, it will return
to Ann Arbor for its first home
games, taking on Penn State in
a three-game series on March
24-25.
This will also mark the Wol-
verines' first action in Big Ten
play.
Though this is Michigan's
last regular-season tournament,
it still has four non-conference
games left against Mid-Amer-
ican Conference opponents
scattered throughout the end of
March and beginning of May.

means of connectivity are a ubiquitous
presence on campus. Walk into a Univer-
sity lecture hall and you'll see students
typing away on MacBooks, some taking careful
notes, others idly surfing the Internet via MWire-
less. But in the early '80s, as personal computing
was just beginning to establish itself as an industry,
then-Dean of Engineering James Duderstadt found
himself with a problem he desperately needed to
solve.
"It turned out very few members of our faculty
had ever used computers," he remembered.
His solution? Give every faculty member easy
access to a computer, but with one important caveat.
"I'd only let them have (a computer) if they'd
take two of them, and one of them they'd have to
take home," Duderstadt said. "They might not use it
themselves, (but) their wife or their children would
use it."
Sure enough, the home computers of many engi-
neering professors were taken overby their children.
The activities of two of these children, Thomas and
John Knoll, would eventually lead to some of the
University's first and most meaningful contribu-
tions to new media and technology.
"From time to time, (their father) would tell me
what they were doing, and one day, he told me,
'They've got this little program that they can use
to manipulate images, that this company I've never
heard of from California called Adobe would like
to license,' " Duderstadt recalled. " 'The boys call it
Photoshop."'
Building the digital world from the ground up

In addition to Photoshop, the University has pro-
duced more of today's technical mainstays, such as
the iPod and the predecessor to the modern Inter-
net, and counts among its alumni Silicon Valley
entrepreneurs such as Google co-founder Larry
Page and Sun Microsystems co-founder Bill Joy.
*"We're very
good at blazing
trails," Duderstadt
said. "That's what
people expect us
to do."
But blazing We keep inv
trails isn't the future. Is M i
work of any one
individual. In and the c halleng
outside the class-
room, innovation I thini
at the University
is, and always has..
been, a collabora-
tiveprocess. Prof. Elliot
Engineer- College of E
ing Prof. Elliot
Soloway at the
College of Engi-
neering teaches
a class that helps1
students develop
iPhone applications. Soloway follows a hands-off,
anti-book-learning mantra that emphasizes student
creativity over textbooks and code samples.
"I help the kids figure out how they can be the
next Larry Page," he said. "I'm not there to teach
them how to program; they can do that by them-

selves ... what you're really trying to find is that abso-
lute crystalline gem of an idea."
So far, this approach seems to be working. Past
student applications include the Michigan app, a
must-have all-in-one app featuring University news,
abuilt-in directory, dininghall menus, and, of course,
bus routes with real-
time schedules. On
a broader scale, his
course is also respon-
sible for the DoGood
application, which
esting in the suggests individual
acts of kindness to its
c n up to users. Digital media
e of change? company Tonic, Inc.
purchased the appli-
k it is. cation in the spring
of 2010. Accord-
ing to its App Store
description, DoGood
Solloway is now responsible for
Engineering "over 1,000,000 good
S S deeds."
In order to main-
tain this level of
accomplishment and
foster an environment
conducive to ingenu-
ity, the University provides substantial investment
in the latest available technology. "We worked hard
to acquire the latest and greatest technology," said
Daniel Atkins, professor of electrical and computer
engineering.
"We provide (students) with atool set ... the free-

dom to be entrepreneurial, to do new things and
develop a self-confidence," he said.
In addition to course offerings, the University's
investment is reflected in state-of-the-art facilities
such as the Digital Media Commons in the Duder-
stadt Center on North Campus. It's designed specifi-
cally to assist students in implementing new ideas
that merge creative arts with more technical fields.
The center houses multimedia facilities including
virtual reality simulators, 3-D labs and recording
studios, which are all free and open for students to
use.
"Over the last couple of years ... we've actually
integrated all these spaces together. So you can go in
the video studio and record something and then you
can walk over to the multimedia room and actually
have all your assets (and) be able to access it," said
Daniel Fessahazion, IT/media integration specialist
at the Duderstadt Center.
Nor is this equipment the pinnacle the University
seeks to reach in terms of fostering innovation. Staff
at the DMC work constantly to add new devices and
improve the center's overall functionality. Recently,
for example, the team worked together to solve a
long-standing student complaint.
"We've (heard from) people who are writing code,
and they want to show the teacher, or they have
rich media that they want to share with the group.
(Originally), you'd have to hook up your device, all
that stuff," Fessahazion said. "(But) we built systems
with Apple TV in them, so as long as you're in the
network, you can actually project whatever you have
in your hand to the big screen. It allows collabora-

ARTS RECOMMENDS
In this feature, Daily Arts writers will give their endorsements
for the arts you need to experience to help you deal with current events.
Cults - Cults
It's warm outside. You're a little less irritable and
are suddenly spending more time playing Frisbee
than you are taking notes in class. Why not cel-
ebrate this unexpected weather with something
equally happy and bright? With its bubbly beats
and twee-pop vocals, Cults's self-titled album has
all the makings of springy, good-day music. And
with its first single "Go Outside," it just feels right.
WARNER BROS.
"Wet Hot American Summer"
With warm weather taking over and the end of
classes in sight, it's time to slide prematurely into
a summertime mood with a great summer film,
"Wet Hot American Summer." This cult hit from
2001, both a satire and a celebration of summer-
camp culture, is one of the funniest movies of the
decade and, conveniently, the perfect procrasti-
nation companion.
RCA
"Duma Key" - Stephen King
Regardless of how amazingthis week's weather
is, it seemed to come out of nowhere - skipping
from high 30s to low 70s in a manner of days. So,
appropriately, check out "Duma Key," a change-of-
pace Stephen King novel set in the Florida Keys.
It's a bit easier to imagine haunted ships in the gulf
coast when the weather is so fine.
ACE TRADE
"The Vampire Diaries"
The CW's golden child, "The Vampire Diaries," is
back tonight after a three-week hiatus. The return-
ing episode will be one of the every-so-often flash-
backepisodes, inwhich we meet another illustrious
female from Damon's sordid past. Though these
episodes tend to sink rather than swim, we can't
help but look forward to the return of our favorite
depraved duo and a litany of scenes featuring Ian
Somerhalder's oh-so-smoldering glances.

What made you decide to get an iPad?
My actual laptop crashed during exam week, so I lost a lot of stuff,
and instead of buying another laptop, I just bought the iPad.
Why the iPad and not another type of tablet?
I hadn't really tried many others, but I just knew that Apple is a
really trusted product.
Any advice for tablet shoppers?
If a student were to get an iPad to bring to class, I would definitely
recommend getting a keyboard because to type on this would be
kind of difficult if you're trying to type fast.

STEP INTO THE SALON 'SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE' (1998), MIRAMAX
Loving, hating on the Bard

Like in the salons of 17th
and 18th century France,
this weekly installment
will feature two Daily Arts
writers discussing the finer
points of arts mediums
from at least 10 years ago.
Shall I compare thee to 1998's
other BestPicture nominees?
Thou art trite and utterly
unmoving.
Weinstein's bribes did shake the
Academy's fickle temperament,
For what else could explain
Gwyneth Paltrow's Oscar?
That's all loosely paraphrased
from the Bard himself - loosely
to the point when it's no longer
really poetry. But then again, nei-
ther is "Shakespeare in Love," no
matter how many flowery roman-
tic clichs its characters spew in
cloyingly delivered Early Modern
English.
In case you can't decipher the
pillaged sonnet in the article's
lead, here's some background.
"Shakespeare in Love" - part
of a slew of overrated Best Pic-
ture winners that includes over-
sentimental saccharine such
as "Crash," "Titanic" and "The
King's Speech" - took home
seven trophies at the 1998 Oscars,
including, as previously stated,
dubiously awarded honors for
Best Picture and Best Actress.
The film's producer, the notori-
ous Harvey Weinstein, famously
spent millions giving the movie
a last-minute advertising push,
which somehow enabled the film
to sneak by Steven Spielberg's
timeless and powerful "Saving
Private Ryan" for the top spot.
The spending drive also managed
to sneak a weakly mustachioed
Paltrow past Cate Blanchett's
regal (literally!) performance in
"Elizabeth" and a hackneyed,
ironically unoriginal script past
the diabolically plotted "Truman
Show."
But the film isn't just bad
because of the hardware it man-
aged to undeservedly win. It also
happens to be a really bad movie.
Swordfights are "West Side
Story"-esque, in the sense that
they evoke a universal "nobody
actually fights like that" reac-
tion. There's a Ben Affleck char-
acter also, who, for all intents and
purposes, is just Affleck phon-
ing in a cringe-worthy "British"
accent. And those are just a few
small, technical things that suck.
There's also the acting, which
is universally overexaggerated
and hamfisted with the small

"We think we're the shit."
exception of Judi Dench's Queen
Elizabeth, whose massive screen
presence is pitifully underuti-
lized. The script, full of not only
the aforementioned romantic cli-
ches but also cheap, unbelievably
serendipitous coincidence, could
have used a rewrite, or five, or a
shredder.
But none of these compare to
the utter derision reserved for.
Joseph Fiennes's William Shake-
speare. Fiennes plays Shake-
speare as an immature dolt in
love with his own voice, a high
school student who thinks over-
emphasized line delivery means
the greatest performance ever.
This only emphasizes the easy-
to-hate elements of the script's
take on Shakespeare, an unstable,
wildly irresponsible man-child.
This man-child is supposedly the
romantic lightning rod, who fans
of the film defend to this day, but
somehow they forget that he's a
philanderer who we see patron-
izing prostitutes. The entire plot
involves him using his honeyed
tongue to seduce Paltrow's vir-
gin (again, literally!) character.
Today, that'd be called creepy and
pedophilic.
In the end, it's not artificially
generated hype or meaningless
trophies that determine a film's
legacy, but how the public looks
at it and its cast and crew years
after its release. "Saving Pri-
vate Ryan" continues to be cited
years later as a true masterpiece,
while "Shakespeare in Love" has
faded into obscurity. While his
older brother went on to transfix
audiences in "In Bruges," "The
Constant Gardener" and "Harry
Potter," Fiennes's last leading
role was as a cop on the ABC
drama "FiashForward," which
slowly hemorrhaged viewers
until the network finally deliv-

ered the coup de grace. Paltrow
has, as "30 Rock" derisively put it,
"gone country," famously record-
ing the most whitewashed Cee-
Lo cover ever performed. And
Affleck? He's back now, and if you
haven't seen "The Town," go see
it. But immediately after "Shake-
speare"? Well, one word: "Gigli."
Advantage: Spielberg.
-DAVID TAO
It's hard not to have a soft spot
for "movie" movies. Films that are
unashamedly, one could argue,
the platonic ideal of the artistic
platform: good fun. These are the
movies filled to the brim with vil-
lains menacing dames, infinitely
quotable dialogue, recognizable
faces, comedy, tragedy, love,
heartbreak and swashbuckling
fights - films that make it onto
the everyman's favorite movie
list. After all, people don't love
"Casablanca" because it captures
the gritty realism of German-
occupied Morocco, or "The Prin-
cess Bride" because it accurately
delves into the morality of killing
the man who killed your father.
We love those films because they
teach us that art can be fun. Even
when it's sad, or dark, or cheesy,
art (especially film) can be full
of a life that makes you want to
jump up and kiss someone.
Speaking of kissing, consider
"Shakespeare in Love," the tale
of how the story of theater and
literature's most famous lovers
came to be. The movie offers us
a profoundly watchable glimpse
into a "fake" (but isn't it fun to
believe it could be true?) slice of
the life of William Shakespeare,
played with an almost uncontain-
able artistic energy by Joseph
Fiennes. An example of this fer-

vor shows up when Shakespeare
finishes a play and declares, "God
I'm good!" It's this exasperated
cockiness that makes the charac-
ter so electric, so likeable.
He is also a sort of rogue, using
his heavenly gift with words to
pilfer to pockets of theater own-
ers looking for banal comedies
and pop the corsets of the sultry
muses who warm his bed. But
because this is a "movie" movie,
his promiscuous ways cannot
continue, and he soon finds true
love in the form of Viola, played
by Gwyneth Paltrow.
Paltrow won an Oscar for this
performance, perhaps deserv-
edly. It's hard to argue against
her charm and her almost angelic
belief in the power of theater.
Also, the few moments of serious-
ness she does provide (namely,
her readings of Shakespeare's
work) are sure to produce shud-
dering and possibly tears.
The two do not stand alone
though, as the cast is full of famil-
iar faces: Ben Affleck appropri-
ately hamming it up, Colin Firth
scheming for love in all the wrong
places, Tom Wilkinson as the
producer who realizes the art is
more important than the money,
and of course Dame Judi Dench,
regal and commanding as Queen
Elizabeth.
"Shakespeare in Love" won't
give you any new insight into the
world. You're unlikely to learn
some deep, dark secret of human-
ity, and you certainly won't finish
it feeling depressed. It's not that
sort of movie. It's the sort that
makes you believe in those tales
of star-crossed lovers, that makes
you want to write poetry (it will
be bad, but who cares?), thatquite
simply makes you full of feeling.
And that's why I adore it.

NEW MEDIA

this and working with people who
manage the networks so we can
allow certain protocols to occur."
The student perspective is also
one that DMC staff find particu-
larly important. Instead of push-
ing decisions through a crowded
bureaucracy, they actively seek
out student input as they build
new initiatives to further improve
the experience.
"We are really close to the
ground in the sense that we want
to know what students are inter-
ested in and what they want to
do," Fessahazion said. "(The
building process) is not driven
from some administrator some-
where saying this is the kind of
stuff we should do. We talk to
people who say, 'it would be awe-
some if I could do this,' and if we
can do it, we make it happen."
Nor is the facility's develop-
ment process driven purely by
engineeringstudents. Through an
atypical arrangement, all Univer-
sity students can and do use the
facilities on a regular basis.
"Because (the DMC is) part of
the library, arts students have
access to these facilities," said
Ted Hall, advanced visualiza-
tion specialist at the Duderstadt
Center. "Other universities would
have similar facilities, but rarely
would arts students have access
to them."

es that move with the technical
zeitgeist aren't enough. As tech-
nology progresses and new media
development filters into class-
rooms and onto students' iPads,
keeping up with trends requires
an attitude that promotes coop-
eration.
"We're trying to make the IT
environment support the act of
collaboration," Atkins said. "It's
the collaboration, both on campus
and across the world, that moves
us to action."
Added Soloway: "When I was
at Yale, talking to colleagues was
forbidden ... but here at Michigan,
it's all about people working with
each other."
While Atkins and Soloway
aren't the only members of the
University who think Michigan's
large community inspires inno-
vation through communication
and teamwork, there's no denying
that widespread new-mediaavail-
ability will permanently alter the
learning environment inside and
outside the classroom.
"More and more of our learn-
ing experiences are not just
classroom based, they involve
producing tangible objects,"
Atkins said.
With learning becoming more
about doing and experimenting,
the University's cyber-infrastruc-
ture has to support the technical
demands of students and classes.
This infrastructure supports
computing, wireless networking
and the University's mobile ser-

that we have bigger collections
of data and new, powerful ways
of extracting knowledge from the
database," Atkins said. "Our goal
is to figure out how to harness all
that ... to help the Michigan com-
munity carry out our mission of
learning, discovery and social
engagement more effectively."
But improving infrastructure
and supporting new innovation
is not simply about replacing old
machines. With an increasing
demand for storage capability,
higher-bandwidth networks and
IT support for staff, the Univer-
sity has had to devise an IT-ser-
vicing program called NextGen
Michigan.
The program is essentially a
strategy the University uses to
find and eliminate redundant,
sub-par machines campus-wide
and develop ways of sharing
information over mobile services.
Atkins hopes that these infra-
structural changes will help the
University continue to foster
research and innovation.
"As culture and technology
platform evolves in Michigan, it
will reinforce the conditions for
innovation and leadership," he
said.
Others see larger, more long-
term implications for the Uni-
versity and higher education as
a whole. Duderstadt sees today's
new-media mainstays as compo-
nents that continue to virtualize
higher education, citing Wikipe-
dia, Google and artificial intelli-
gence as the triumvirate behind
it all.
"Wikipedia has the capacity to
build communities of people try-
ing to learn things," Duderstadt
said. "Google is just a term now

for 'all knowledge is digitized and
available.' (Artificial intelligence)
is the increasing use of analyt-
ics that can scroll through this
huge amount of knowledge ... and
extract information."
Together, Duderstadt believes
that this combination can even-
tually fulfill the same role as
modern universities. "(Wikipe-
dia) is the learning community;
(Google is) knowledge, like the
library of Alexandria times bil-
lions; and (artificial intelligence)
is the capacity to authenticate
knowledge and certify learning,"
Duderstadt explained. "This is a
university ... I think that's your
future."
The facilities and the students
must conjoin
But not everybody looks at the
University's future with the same
amount of optimism. University
professor John Holland, known as
the father of genetic algorithms,
believes that recent growth in
class sizes and the depersonali-
zation of education has compro-
mised the University's affinity for
research and innovation.
"The University has become
more and more a factory," he said.
"It's about how efficient we are at
cranking out students, and that
goes partly against the notion of
research."
And despite attempts at adding
to available facilities and rein-
vesting in new technology, Hol-
land also sees some limits in the
overall vision of the University.
"You're not going to be doing
any long-range stuff unless it has
something that you can deliver
in less than three years. Funding

for anything longer keeps getting
cut," Holland said.
But large incoming classes
and decreased state funding
hasn't stopped the University
from investing in technology and
improving facilities available to
students. For the 'U,' providing
and building a cutting-edge tech-
nological platform is a work-in-
progress.
For the DMC, for example,
funding has been plentiful. In
order to improve access to tech-
nology, the University spends
upward of $20,000 dollars for
software packages, including pro-
grams needed to run the record-
ing studios and 3-D labs. On top of
that, the technology is constantly
being updated to correlate with
the current media environment.
"We just remodeled two of our
audio studios, which cost about
$800,000 ... they're some of the
best recording facilities in North
America," said John Williams,
director of the Duderstadt Center.
Ample money is also available
to indulge student curiosity and
facilitate their experimentation
with new, powerful and obscure
software.
"You have an idea ... we will
work with you and help your
vision come to life" Fessahazion
said. "Within what resources we
have, we'll buy the package, and
you can play with it, use it and
develop your project."
This leads to a technical eco-
system in constant flux, as updat-
ed additions are integrated.
"Every year, the infrastruc-
ture gets better ... they have new,
unbelievable resources. We keep
investing in the future," Soloway
said. "Is Michigan up to the chal-

lenge of change? I think it is."
Added Atkins: "Building infra-
structure is not something you do
once, it's an organic process. We
have put together a new organi-
zational structure and new policy
that will keep that organic pro-
cess going."
With all these available
resources, it's up to students to
take the initiative and use the
services the University has put
at their disposal. Facilities like
the DMC offer millions of dollars
worth of equipment free of charge
to anyone who wants to use it.
And since the DMC first opened,
it has attracted people from all
fields who come to the facility to
bringtheir bold new ideas to life.
"A cardiologist ... used the
(recording) studio to determine
whether or not you could hear the
blood flow in the veins to deter-
mine if there was a lower-cost
way to do early detection of arte-
rial chlorosis," Williams said.
Art & Design senior Danielle
Battaglia envisioned the universe
for her senior design project; she
didn't want to model the universe
using plastic, she didn't want to
draw it out - she wanted to walk
through the idea in her head.
"I wanted to model the uni-
verse. I did a lot of research on it
because I was curious about black
holes," Battaglia said. "I kind of
said that the Big Bang could be at
the center of the black hole. I told
my professor I was interested in
this, and she pointed me to the
DMC (Virtual Reality Lab)."
Added Atkins: "For students,
there's an unlimited amount of
opportunity, but you have to take
the initiative to find out and pur-
sue it."

books required by some Univer-
sity classes. In fact, there is the
potential for an entire online
textbook initiative. And given
the widespread use of tools such
as CTools and Wolverine Access,
it's obvious that the University is
no stranger to online homework
and resources.
Conway said that despite the
problems e-readers present, he is
supportive of the library's efforts
to get involved in the e-book
business.
"In many regards, I believe
that e-readers are the future
of reading. Portability, flexibil-
ity and easy access to millions
of books are just three currently
obvious reasons," Conway said.
"As books change from being
static objects produced and con-
trolled by publishers to flexible,
interactive creations remixed by
users, the advantages of e-read-
ers become even greater."
Conway's prediction that
e-readers are the future of
reading may be correct. The

announced closing of Michigan
Book & Supply earlier this week
and the noticeable absence of
Borders on East Liberty suggest
that students are slowly moving
away from buying traditional
textbooks.
Kevin Hawkins, MLibrary's
head of digital-publishing pro-
duction, said this slow progres-
sion from physical book usage to
e-readers is comparable to the
progression of the music industry.
"Students are growing
increasingly comfortable buying
and consuming digital media,
and textbook publishers, which
have been sticking with print
to protect their revenue model,
are shifting to digital distribu-
tion now that the e-reader ven-
dors have set up sales channels
that make it easy for consumers
to acquire the books legally,"
Hawkins said. "It's similar to
music: While some people still
buy music on vinyl or CD, for
most consumers, a digital ver-
sion is more convenient, despite
its drawbacks."
Though Easterwood prefers
traditional books, she noted that
her Kindle makes reading for
classes much easier when she's on
the go.
"I use my Kindle when I have
to carry a lot of books and don't
want my bag to be too heavy,"
she explained. "For instance, it is
convenient when traveling."
LSA junior Wisam Berry is a
strong advocate of e-reader usage
at the college level. Berry, who has
used an e-reader in place of actu-

ally purchasing textbooks, said it
was much more convenient and
practical for all of his readings.
He said he would prefer to use an
e-reader in all of his classes.
"It would be all in one place
and easily accessible from any-
where and not just if I carry the
book around with me," Berry
said.
LSA junior Sandhya Rajagopal,
who has also used an e-reader in
place of a textbook, said e-readers
are more than just a convenience
because they are easier to use than
traditional textbooks.
"They are also helpful in that
they allow you to quickly search
(or) look up specific topics or
keywords," she said.
While the ability to easily look
up unfamiliar terms or literary
allusions is an appealing pros-
pect for many people, Rabkin
said "easier" isn't always better.
"Ease is probably a good thing
for most people. We don't like
to make life difficult," he said.
"(But) if you want to make that
reading part of you, then whatev-
er kind of resistance the author
has built into the text needs to be
there. And the e-reader, in fact,
undercuts that."
So will University students
soon be relying solely on elec-
tronic resources for their home-
work needs? While there's no
definitive answer just yet, it's
certainly a prospect worth con-
sidering, especially to the stu-
dents at the University, who will
be directly affected by its out-
come.
