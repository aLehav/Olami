Daily investigation finds University Housing 

lacked concern and protocols for ResStaff safety

21 current, former resident staf members allege mishandling of employee concerns

Content Warning: mentions of sexual assault, 

sexual harassment

On Sept. 8, 2020, over 100 residential 

advisors –– University housing staff members 
consisting of student employees –– at the 
University of Michigan voted to strike, 
frustrated by hazardous pandemic-induced 
working conditions. 

The University reached a deal with 

residential 
staff 

members 
two 

weeks later. As part of this agreement, the 
University agreed to provide ResStaff with 
updated data on COVID-19 cases in residence 
halls and daily communication regarding case 
numbers as well. 

They also promised the formation of the 

Residential Experience Council (REC), a 
biweekly forum for residential staff members 
to voice their concerns to University Housing 
administrators.

A Michigan Daily investigation into 

University Housing policies found that 
University Housing has reneged on its 
commitment to ensure residential staff 

members’ safety after the 

Fall 2020 strike. 

In August and September 2021, University 

Housing did not hold any REC meetings 
according to an email obtained by The Daily 
sent on Oct. 19, in which Director of Residence 
Education Jasmine Clay scheduled the first 
REC meeting two months into the semester. 

Clay wrote that meeting frequency will be 

reduced from biweekly to monthly. In addition, 
the email also included a guideline that 
regulated residential staff members’ behavior 
during REC meetings.

According to the email, REC meetings will 

not be used 

to 
discuss 

“personnel 
matters 

regarding specific supervisors of (residential 
staff 
members). 
Building 
representatives 

should follow the designated Department 
communication route to share personnel 
feedback,” Clay wrote.

For 
residential 
staff 
members, 
the 

“designated 
Department 
communication 

route” is their hall director, an in-dorm 
supervisor who directly oversees everyday 
work. Circumventing hall directors and 
reporting directly to their supervisors is heavily 
discouraged by University Housing, according 
to interviews with 21 current and former 
residential staff members.

These staff members allege this prevents 

some safety concerns from reaching University 
Housing administrators. 

In an email statement to The Daily, Amir 

Baghdadchi, Senior Associate Director of 
University Housing, commented on University 
Housing’s reporting processes.

“ResStaff can always find a first resource 

in their direct supervisor, who typically lives 
in the same building alongside their ResStaff, 
present and available to talk,” Baghdadchi said. 
“In addition, one of the strengths of our student 
staff program is that each member is part of 
a larger cohort of fellow ResStaff, including 
more experienced RAs, and some of the most 
valuable support comes from that community.”

A Daily investigation found University 

Housing failed to properly respond to 
numerous 
undisclosed 
safety 
concerns 

brought by residential staff members 
between 2018 and 2021.

Before the strike in Fall 2020, residential 

staff members were prohibited from 
speaking to the media, according to Letter of 
Appointment (LOA) documents obtained by 
The Daily. 

“ResStaff may not communicate publicly 

(including to the news media, in social media, 
or other public communication venues) about 
professional matters internal to University 
Housing without authorization from a 
supervisor,” the policy stated.

Current LOA documents, also obtained 

by The Daily, do not outline forbidden actions 
such as engagement with the media. The 
LOA from 2019-2020 was 12 pages long; the 
updated LOA for 2021-2022 is only one page 

long.

Despite the policy change, numerous 

residential staff members allege that hall 
directors continue to discourage interviews 
with the media. They fear that the vagueness 
of their current contracts would allow the 
University to easily terminate their employment.

Baghdadchi wrote in an email to The Daily 

that residential staff members are free to engage 
with the media. 

“Student staff have always been free to 

express their personal points of view as students 
to the media,” Baghdadchi wrote. “To ensure 
accuracy, factual questions about Michigan 
Housing are handled by professional staff.” 

Baghdadchi also wrote that he acknowledges 

the difficulty of residential staff work and 
shared the support provided to these staff 
members by the University.

“Resident advisors and diversity peer 

educators, known as ResStaff, have some of 
the toughest and most critical student jobs on 
campus, and we know that for them to support 
residents, they need strong support from 
Housing,” Baghdadchi wrote. 

Former residential staff member Isra 

Elshafei also spoke of the difficulty of residential 
staff work.

“It was a constant feeling of being a pawn in 

their system. We were being stripped of being 
a student,” Elshafei said. “We were no longer a 
student, we were just an RA.” 

The Daily spoke with a former residential 

staff member, who asked to remain anonymous 
for fear of professional repercussions. In this 

article, she will be referred to as Alice.

Bagdadchi declined to comment on Alice’s 

experiences. 

“The University does not comment on 

personnel matters,” Bagdadchi wrote.

Survivors 
of 
the 
late 

doctor 
Robert 
Anderson 

will be receiving a $490 
million 
settlement 
from 

the University of Michigan, 
according to attorney Jamie 
White 
on 
Wednesday 

morning. 

The settlement agreement, 

which 
White 
said 
was 

reached 
Tuesday 
night, 

comes after over 15 months of 
mediation between Anderson 
survivors and the University. 

The 
mediation 
– 
which 

initially began in Oct. 2020 
– represents 1,050 survivors 
who have come forward with 
sexual misconduct allegations 
against Anderson. It is not 
related to the class-action suit 
that was filed on behalf of all 
Anderson survivors in May 
2021. 

Since 
then, 
over 
950 

survivors 
– 
possibly 
the 

largest number in history 
– 
 
have 
come 
forward 

with allegations of sexual 
misconduct 
against 

Anderson. 

White, 
who 
represents 

78 of the survivors, told 
The Michigan Daily the 
settlement still needs to be 
approved by a judge and the 
survivors themselves. He said 
while no amount of money 
can compensate the victims 
for what they endured, the 
University 
taking 
some 

accountability in this case is a 
promising sign.

“It’s always difficult to put 

a value on what is fair and 
what is not fair when it comes 
to having your childhood 
taken away,” White said. 
“Based on my conversations 
with my clients, even prior to 

yesterday, (I think) that this 
is going to be acceptable to 
them.”

According to a U-M press 

release obtained by The Daily, 
the settlement – pending 
approval from the Board of 
Regents – will provide $460 
million to the 1,050 victims 
and the remaining $30 million 
will be reserved for any future 
claimants who participate 
before July 31, 2023. The 
settlement has approval from 
98% of the claimants.

Students, faculty reflect on Schlissel’s 
termination, hopeful for future healing

In the days after the U-M President’s firing, campus 

community reacts to impact on ‘U’

ANNA FIFELSKI
Daily Staff Reporter

In the days following former University of 

Michigan President Mark Schlissel’s termination, 
students, faculty and staff have voiced their 
opinions on the impact that Schlissel’s departure, 
and the introduction of interim President Mary Sue 
Coleman, will have on the University. 

While some have taken to social media to join the 

conversation — making memes about the contents 
of his emails as well as critiquing his vernacular 
and his Pizza House order — others have released 
statements condemning Schlissel’s actions and 
warning the community to be mindful of the 
“memes, jokes, and comments” surrounding the 
situation. 

Business sophomore Faith Richardson said the 

emails gave insights about Schlissel’s character in 
addition to his relationship with a subordinate.

“(The emails) gave you a strange insight into 

former President Schlissel and just little things 
about (his life),” Richardson said. “Like ‘You only 
tip 10% to Pizza House’, or, we’re all worried about 
COVID and he’s out here being like, ‘Oh, when can 
we go to Paris’ or whatever.”

LSA sophomore Keara Broome said she was 

happy to hear about Schlissel’s termination because 
she didn’t support his handling of the GEO strike, 
his COVID-19 policies, and other University issues. 
However, Broome said she was uncomfortable with 
the nature of how Schlissel was dismissed.

“As funny as it is to see the memes about it and 

to see everybody posting on Yik Yak about it, it’s 
awful. Like, I can’t forget that this is super gross 
and exploitative,” Broome said. “Obviously, power 
imbalances and sexual misconduct from those in 
authority is not some kind of crazy surprise. But 
then this just kind of piles on to the University’s 
stack of issues.”

Richardson said she was surprised by the 

announcement of Schlissel’s firing but is looking 
forward to the healing impact that it may have for 
the survivors of sexual assault from the University.

“I almost see this as a win for Jon Vaughn,” 

Richardson said. “He has been protesting outside 
of Schlissel’s house. I mean, it’s obviously not the 
outcome anyone was expecting. I don’t think this is 
the end of the fight. In a way, it was like a small win 
for (the people) who have been so frustrated with 
the administration and even the Board of Regents to 
just kind of be like, ‘Okay, something right happened 
for once.’”

In an email to The Michigan Daily, Art and 

Design professor Rebekah Modrak wrote she is 
looking forward to a permanent replacement for 
Schlissel. Modrak also wrote she is specifically 
hoping for a president who is humble, kind and 
ethical in addition to someone who takes action 
when they hear about violations and who appoints 
critical co-leaders.

“There’s an army of administrators who 

ensure that reports of violations are suppressed or 
obstructed,” Modrak wrote. “The culture of this 
university, from the Regents through the upper 
administrative levels, is one that is autocratic 
and discourages dissent. It’s completely against 
academic principles involving criticality and the 
search for truth. I’ve asked critical questions 
in meetings and had my hand slapped as a 
public warning to me and to other members of 
the committee not to get out of line. Schlissel’s 
departure will have no impact on them.” 

Looking ahead, Modrak wrote she expects little 

to change in terms of the University’s handling of 
sexual misconduct, despite the terms of Schlissel’s 
dismissal. 

University spokesperson Rick Fitzgerald told 

The Daily in an email that the University’s updated 
sexual misconduct policies prohibit teacher-learner 
and supervisor-supervisee relationships. 

“The university is going to extraordinary 

measures to put critical protections in place on 
top of earlier protections,” Fitzgerald wrote. “We 
continue to work with the nationally recognized 
consulting firm of Guidepost Solutions on additional 
measures.”

Over 20 members of the Ann 

Arbor for Public Power (A2P2) 
protested in front of Larcom City 
Hall Tuesday night ahead of an Ann 
Arbor City Council vote to implement 
a feasibility study in creating a 
municipal energy utility. The non-
profit organization advocates for 
the city to municipalize its energy 
utilities, meaning ensuring energy 

resources are owned and operated 

on and for the city instead of a 
private company. 

The organization is supporting 

the replacement of DTE Energy — 
the only energy service provider 

in Ann Arbor — with alternative 
methods of public power. The city 
of Ann Arbor has been working 
with private utilities like DTE 
to deliver power while pursuing 
its carbon neutrality plan, which 
was criticized by the protestors 
Tuesday night. Seventy percent of 
DTE’s power is derived from non-
renewable sources — specifically 
from coal. 

AA Public Power was formed 

last summer after frustrations 
surrounding multiple DTE power 
outages throughout Ann Arbor 
and in the state of Michigan due to 
thunderstorms. 

LSA senior Zackariah Farah, 

one of the protest’s lead organizers, 
explained that switching to public 

power would allow the city to make 
improvements in energy resources 
that DTE does not support. In an 
interview with The Michigan Daily, 
Farah said the improvements would 
include resilient infrastructure, use 
of solar and wind power in Ann 
Arbor and purchasing power from 
renewable sources both within and 
outside the state of Michigan. 

“We’re hoping that under local 

control, we’re going to be able to do 
a lot of the things that DTE doesn’t 
allow us to do, like make sure that 
our infrastructure is resilient so 
it doesn’t fail every time the wind 
blows,” Farah said. “It will allow us 
to create solar and wind farms right 
here in Ann Arbor and to purchase 
selectively power from renewable 

sources around the state and even 
outside of the state. So that’s why 
this group (A2P2) was formed.” 

Farah said the organization has 

spent a year requesting that the 
city’s Energy Commission fund and 
authorize a feasibility study that 
would provide data on the transition 
from nonrenewable to renewable 
power. 
When 
the 
commission 

met on Dec. 14, they unanimously 
recommended that City Council 
approve a feasibility study.

“The University’s buying a lot 

of dirty power from DTE because 
there’s no other choice,” Farah said. 
“DTE is a monopoly.”

Public policy experts talk redistricting process, gerrymandering 

Ford School hosts event analyzing, reflecting on 

new Michigan district maps

The Ford School of Public Policy 

held a virtual discussion Wednesday 
evening reflecting on Michigan’s 
citizen-led redistricting process and 
discussed how lessons from that 
process could be applied to the rest 
of the United States.

This event was hosted by the Ford 

School’s Center for Local, State and 
Urban Policy, the civic engagement 
organization Voters Not Politicians 

and Michigan State University’s 
Institute for Public Policy and Social 
Research. Wednesday’s discussion 
was the final webinar in a series of 
events on redistricting hosted by 
Ford and was moderated by Matt 
Grossmann, director of the Institute 
for Public Policy and Social Research 
at Michigan State University. 

The lengthy process of creating 

new district maps for Michigan 
ended on Dec. 28 of last year when 
the Michigan Independent Citizen 
Redistricting Commission (MICRC) 
voted to adopt new congressional 

and 
state 
legislative 
districts. 

The commission, made up of 13 
randomly selected applicants, was 
established after Michigan voters 
approved a 2018 constitutional 
amendment. Proponents of the 
amendment 
argued 
it 
would 

combat political gerrymandering 
by 
preventing 
elected 
officials 

and 
other 
influential 
partisan 

figures from participating in the 
redistricting process.

David Daley is the author of 

bestseller “Ratf**ked: The True 
Story Behind the Secret Plan to 

Steal America’s Democracy,” a book 
credited in helping spark the recent 
movement to push back against 
gerrymandering in the U.S. Daley said 
the state’s redistricting process was a 
highlight among the nation’s ongoing 
efforts to combat gerrymandering. 
He compared the successful citizen-
led redistricting commissions of 
Michigan, Iowa and California to 
those in less-successful states such as 
Utah, Ohio and Virginia.

University of Michigan stu-

dents turned out in record num-
bers for the November 2020 
election, with 78.1% casting a 
ballot, according to a report by 
the Institute for Democracy & 
Higher Education at Tufts Uni-
versity. This outpaces the 66% 
turnout across all of the campuses 
included in the report and mirrors 
the 79% turnout in Washtenaw 
County. 

Nevertheless, student voters at 

the University have historically 
demonstrated low turnout in local 
elections, leaving some to consider 
that the turnout problem doesn’t 
solely lie in students not wanting 
to engage but in other factors such 
as voting accessibility. 

This could boil down to a long-

debated structural issue — the 
1956 adoption of Ann Arbor’s 
pie-shaped ward map. The 1956 
City Charter established five pie-
shaped wards, and in an April 
1967 election, Charter Amend-
ment Three passed, codifying the 
requirement that there be five 
wards that are compact, of similar 
population and wedge-shaped, 
tapering from the city’s edge into 
Downtown Ann Arbor.

This 
pie-shaped 
require-

ment effectively splits up student 
neighborhoods surrounding the 
University, making it difficult for 
students to hold a majority in a 
single ward. In an interview with 
The Michigan Daily, Council-
member Kathy Griswold, D-Ward 
2, said some community members 
have claimed that the pie-shaped 
requirement was “Republican 
gerrymandering” 
implemented 

to intentionally crack students 
into multiple wards, although it is 
unclear whether that is the case.

In an email to The Daily, 

Kenichi Lobbezoo, Ann Arbor 
Student Advisory Council chair 
and Skyline High School senior, 
wrote that the pie-shaped wards 
dilute college student voices in 
government. 

“Whether intentionally or not, 

the current ward structure has 
the effect of basically gerryman-
dering student votes,” Lobbezoo 
wrote. “If students are split up 
into different wards where they’re 
in the minority, it’s that much 
harder to elect one of their own.” 

In March 1967, a month prior 

to the election which codified 
the pie-shaped ward require-

ment, City Council Democrats 
proposed a six-ward plan, which 
they believed would provide stu-
dents stronger representation and 
increase the ties between coun-
cilmembers to their constituents. 
The plan was struck down by the 
Council’s 7-4 Republican majority, 
preserving the five-ward system. 

At the time, council Republi-

cans claimed the Democrats’ plan 
would decrease council efficiency 
and was designed as a power grab, 
but then-City Attorney Jacob Fah-
rner Jr. penned an opinion claim-
ing that the change would not, in 
fact, establish minority rule. 

Ballot text of the Ann Arbor 

City Charter amendments con-
sidered in the April 3, 1967 elec-
tion, obtained by FOIA. Charter 
Amendment Three passed with 
56% of the vote and Charter 
Amendment Four failed with 47% 
of the vote. City of Ann Arbor.

In April 1967, the community 

had the opportunity to vote on 
Charter Amendment Four, which 
proposed a six-ward requirement, 
but the amendment failed amid a 
Republican sweep of the election.

Now, more than 50 years later, 

the five-ward, pie-shaped map 
persists, with City Council recent-
ly approving a pie-shaped reappor-
tionment of wards despite claims 
the new map sustains the status 
quo and disenfranchises students.

Ann Arbor’s new ward bound-

aries continue to split student 
housing into multiple wards. The 
University of Michigan lies at the 
center of the map where the wards 
intersect. City of Ann Arbor.

The primary problem
Ann Arbor holds its primaries 

in August, before students come 
back to campus. A Republican has 
not held a City Council seat since 
2005, meaning primary elections 
tend to be the deciding election for 
City Council seats because Demo-
cratic primary winners typically 
either beat a Republican challeng-
er or run unopposed in the general 
election.

Since most students are out of 

town, they miss the determining 
election for their Councilmember. 

Rackham student Amir Fleis-

chmann, contract committee co-
chair for the Graduate Employees’ 
Organization, said in an interview 
with The Daily the August prima-
ries prevent students from both 
voting and running for office. 

“The way City Council is elect-

ed with the de facto election being 
the Democratic primary that takes 

place in August disempowers stu-
dents,” Fleischmann said. “It’s not 
really possible for (students) to 
run for these positions, so we can’t 
have representation on council in 
the way that others are able to.”

Student voters have historically 

encountered obstacles in register-
ing to vote, and students who move 
residences between wards from 
year to year face the challenges of 
having to update their voter regis-
tration and becoming acquainted 
with their new councilmembers.

University students cast early 

votes for the November 2020 elec-
tion at the temporary Ann Arbor 
City Clerk’s satellite office estab-
lished at the University of Michi-
gan Museum of Art. More than 
48,000 students are enrolled at 
the University of Michigan, but it 
is unclear what proportion of Ann 
Arbor’s 113,000 residents are stu-
dents. Students have historically 
been undercounted by the census, 
with the lowest census response 
rate being in student dominated 
neighborhoods. 

Despite students making up a 

significant, yet ill-defined chunk, 
of Ann Arbor’s population, they 
are rarely elected to council. The 

most recent student Councilmem-
ber, Zachary Ackerman, D-Ward 
3, served from 2015 to 2020 and 
was the first student elected in 
more than two decades. 

Nithya Arun, president of Cen-

tral Student Government and 
Public Health senior, said since 
students make up such a large per-
centage of the population, their 
interests should be represented on 
City Council. 

“When we look at the composi-

tion of City Council, none of them 
are students currently, which kind 
of doesn’t make sense, because a 
lot of Ann Arbor is (composed) of 
students,” Arun said. “(Students) 
are a significant population, and 
any type of population, for that 
matter, deserves representation.” 

In 2005, University student 

Eugene Kang ran for City Council 
in Ward 2, and lost the August pri-
mary by a narrow 95-vote margin, 
despite significantly out-fundrais-
ing his opponent. 

Notably, in Kang’s race, zero 

votes were cast from Ward 2’s Sec-
ond Precinct which encompasses 
Mary Markley Residence Hall. 
Had the election been held when 
Markley’s more than 1,100 student 

residents were moved in, it is pos-
sible Kang could have mustered 
enough student votes to carry him 
to victory.

Students seek a piece of the pie
Arun, Fleischmann, Griswold 

and Lobbezoo all pointed to a stu-
dent being elected to City Council 
as a possible immediate way to 
increase student representation on 
local issues. 

“The most direct solution is to 

elect more students to local gov-
ernment,” Lobbezoo wrote. “The 
more young people you have in 
local government, the more local 
government is going to be recep-
tive to the priorities of young peo-
ple.” 

Nevertheless, the time commit-

ment required for a council mem-
ber can serve as a barrier to entry 
for college students. Councilmem-
bers and the mayor are considered 
part-time workers, and many hold 
full-time jobs, although balancing 
day jobs and council duties can be 
difficult.

“I’ve never met a student who 

wanted to be on council at the 
same time they were a U of M stu-
dent,” Griswold said.

Student interest in holding pub-

lic office may be limited, but it isn’t 
nonexistent. Last year, students 
formed the Coalition to Elect Stu-
dents to the Board of Regents, as 
they felt representation was lack-
ing on the board.

In an interview with The Daily, 

Ann Arbor Mayor Christopher 
Taylor said if a student were to be 
elected to City Council, they would 
have to be able to understand the 
interest of all of their constituents 
— including non-students.

“The student who wishes to be 

elected has to understand their 
potential constituents and to 
communicate to them why (the 
student) will be the best repre-
sentative for them,” Taylor said. 
“Unless you intentionally gerry-
mander the student district, then 
any student running for office 
would need to ensure that their 
campaign included and spoke to 
the hopes and dreams of non-stu-
dents.”

Fleischmann said the lack of a 

student councilmember results in 
City Council overlooking student 
issues.

Around 100 community members rally against violence at 
Women’s Huron Valley Correctional Facility in Ypsilanti

Daily Staff Reporter

Protestors oppose prison’s operation, advocate for justice for incarcerated individuals

Content warning: This article 

contains descriptions of violence 
against women.

Around 
100 
community 

members gathered outside the 
Women’s Huron Valley Correc-
tional Facility in Ypsilanti Sun-

day morning to protest against 
the prison’s operation and advo-
cate for justice for the currently 
incarcerated individuals.

Gwen Thomas, one of the 

organizers of the protest, pro-
vided 
The 
Michigan 
Daily 

with two whistleblower clips. 
The clip was recorded by a for-
mer prison employee detailing 
the abuses inside the facility. 

The anonymous voice on the 
recording said a male correc-
tional officer, believed to come 
from a contracted service, strip 
searched the female inmates 
outside of camera view, which 
is against the facility’s policy, 
according to the recording. The 
recording said the officer was 
not reprimanded. 

The Women’s Huron Val-

ley Correctional Facility has 
also received criticisms over 
its crowding level and sanitary 
condition following 24 scabies 
breakthrough cases among their 
inmates in 2019. 

Ashley Goldon, who was 

formerly incarcerated and is 
now the director for the state-
wide program Nation Outside, 
a Michigan-based organization 
dedicated to supporting justice-
impacted individuals, spoke at 
the protest. Nation Outside is 
Goldon recounted her experi-
ences in the facility during her 
speech. 

“Before I was an advocate, 

before I was a director of Nation 
Outside or had a pot to piss in, I 
was (identified in the prison as) 
681349,” Goldon said. “We can’t 
heal our nation by treating the 
most vulnerable population like 
animals. Even the prongs give 
their beasts access to heat and 
water.”

In an interview with The 

Daily, Goldon explained how 
gender 
inequality, 
combined 

with rising COVID-19 cases and 
overcrowding, made this facil-
ity’s situation unusual, even 
among Michigan prisons where 
the incarcerated serve on aver-
age the longest sentences in the 
U.S. 

“There weren’t nearly as 

many women in the prison at 
Huron 
Valley 
(Correctional 

Facility) when I was there,” 
Goldon said. “They have 400 
beds, but the facility was never 

intended to hold 2400 people, 
so they were making rooms that 
were once common areas into 
sleeping quarters. We’ve been 
hearing complaints from the 
women on the inside that they 
are sleeping on the floor. The 
difference with a men’s prison 
is that they have several facili-
ties to shuffle people around if 
needed to make sure everyone 
is safe for COVID. There is only 
one for women in Michigan.”

The 
protestors 
marched 

around the correctional facility. 
Facing the building from behind 
the fencing and barbed wire, the 
crowd stood in a line and shout-
ed: “We see you, we love you, we 
will be fighting with you!” 

Goldon told The Daily in an 

interview after the rally that 
later contact with individuals 
inside the facility, many felt and 
were inspired by the support 
from outside, but the prison shut 
down the yard to prevent gath-
ering.

Gordon 
also 
pointed 
out 

that Women’s Huron Valley 
Correctional Facility was dis-
proportionately 
impacted 
by 

COVID-19. According to data 
published 
by 
the 
Michigan 

Department of Corrections, as 
of Jan. 19, there were 276 posi-
tive active cases. 

Shawanna Vaughn, a jus-

tice-impacted activist and the 
founder of Silent Cry, Inc., said 
she travelled to Michigan from 
New York after hearing about 
the protest and violence against 

women in the prison system. 
During her speech to the crowd, 
she underscored the trauma 
linked to incarceration and 
encouraged Michiganders to 
press for legislative change like 
she did in NY for W76337, the 
post-traumatic prison disorder 
act that made its way to the New 
York State Senate.

“W76337 was my prison num-

ber,” Vaughn said. “I wrote it 
myself because it’s the only mass 
incarceration mental health bill 
in the country, and I’m clear that 
everybody who comes home 
from prison is not well. Guess 
what? Since the state made us 
not well, they don’t want to heal 
us, but 2022 is gonna be a dif-
ferent type of season because 
we comin (sic)to get everything 
they steal from us.”

Trische’ 
Duckworth, 
the 

founder of Survivors Speak, 
told The Daily about their goals 
for enacting legislative change, 
including advocating for SB487, 
a Michigan Senate bill to pro-
vide oversight over women’s 
prison. 

“When it comes to criminal 

justice reform, our politicians 
are the ones that legislatively 
delay on that, ” Duckworth 
said, “So if they’re not going to 
do what’s right in their seat, we 
will ensure that we individuals 
will do what is right for people 
at all times.”

Campus Culture is committed to 

serving the students of the University 
of Michigan and providing them with 
everything they need to know about stu-
dent culture. Needless to say, we have 
opinions that need to be aired out like 
Necto at two a.m. (so damp…). An Ins and 
Outs list is a necessity for the culture — 
Campus Culture, that is. Yik Yak barely 
begins to flesh out the essential details of 
what’s hot and what’s not. We are trying 
to do the historical work of documenting 
why Doc Martens are essential for the 
preservation of student social life (or at 
least mine).

Before we begin, we’d thought we’d 

give you a little knish (we all know the 
tea) and provide an aggregate In and Out 
list, because the best hot takes come in 
quick succession.

So here we are — Kaya Ginsky and 

Matthew Eggers. We have taken it upon 
ourselves to make the official Campus 
Culture Ins and Outs list for 2021. We 
will try to keep it brief, but to be real, 
the best Ins and Outs lists come by lis-
tening to the one-hour loop version of 
“Haunted” by Laura Les (why can’t I be 
like Maude Apatow?).

IN:
Micro Niche Meme Accounts —
As much as I consider myself a Cam-

pus Culture writer, at this point, I am 
basically on the Digital Culture beat. All 
I ever think about is memes. And what’s 
really devastating is that I know there 
are people who spend even more time 
thinking about the state of meme culture 
than I do. 

These micro-niche accounts present a 

curated selection of memes that best fit 
their small shared interest on campus. If 
you like belittling people who drink milk, 
so do I — and there’s an Instagram page 
for us! @umich_milkdrinkers has your 
daily dose of candid photos of people 
caught in the act. If you like British peo-
ple, I don’t. But if you do, @incellectuals_
umich provides a post-modern look into 
on-campus meme culture. And of course 

who could forget the OG @umichaffir-
mations? They paved the way for internet 
culture to become more important than 
flyers in the Diag. It was a big moment in 
2021 and will remain iconic in 2022.

Library Bathrooms —
Confession… I have IBS. Not really, but 

every time I take an exam, my sphincter 
feels like it’s about to implode. Clearly, I 
need solace, and you can’t find that when 
you’re sharing a bathroom with two 
of your BFFs. Library bathrooms have 
entered the chat. If you get it, you get 
it, and if you don’t, you are missing out. 
There is such a sense of euphoria I get 
from going to the library now. I’m excit-
ed to walk in, even when I don’t have to 
go. The library loves me. 

Who else would let me find comfort 

in a bathroom with harsh fluorescent 
lighting? Who else would ask if I wanted 
to check out a book? Of course, we love 
the library! Not to mention that their 
collection of digital resources has saved 
my behind in the academic sense as well. 
Totally recommend it, and would go 
again.

Frozen Yogurt —
When did froyo stop being trendy? 

It’s sweet, light and feels oddly healthy 
considering the mountains of cookie and 
brownie dough piled on top. While self-
serve froyo places took over the suburbs 
by the dozens in the 2010s, it feels like 

the froyo craze is over. But the under-
rated sweet deserves a comeback. As a 
froyo fangirl before and after it was cool, 
I recommend campus favorites Moon 
Cafe and Amer’s Deli. 

Lecture Recordings —
I physically can’t bring myself to walk 

into a lecture hall at nine in the morn-
ing. I don’t know whether it’s my lack 
of vitamin C, my Britney Spears alarm 
clock noise or listening to hyperpop right 
before going to bed (probably that, TBH). 
Nine a.m. lectures aren’t an option. Hav-
ing a recording ready at 10:40 makes my 
life so much easier. It’s not that I don’t 
want to go to class, but class doesn’t have 
a 1.5x speed option… just kidding! 

I am here for education after all, and 

who am I to pass up a class to learn about 
the ins and outs of logic design. For real 
though, thank you to the professors who 
provide more accommodations than a 
simple Piazza post.

Seasonal Drinks —
Students deserve the joy that comes 

from a designer drink for all of 2022. 
While it’s often mocked, ordering apple 
cider, pumpkin spice lattes or pepper-
mint hot chocolates at a coffee shop is 
not embarrassing. Seasonalizing these 
drinks only adds to the stigma. We 
deserve to enjoy the comforting tastes of 
artificial flavoring year-round and with-
out shame. 

Sleeping on the Bus —
It’s two a.m.. You just finished your 

partying 
in 
Kerrytown/Necto/Frat 

Row/wherever and you just got on the 
bus back to North. This is an experience 
few really understand, but it is a neces-
sity to me. Slouching against the edge of 
the chair, you can get five minutes of the 
best sleep ever on Bursley-Baits. Just for 
a moment, exams, homework and friend 
group drama all fade into the monoto-
nous drone of the engine. 

If anything, finding peace among the 

hectic need to do is some of the most 
restorative work you could do — so make 
sleeping on the bus in for 2021.

OUT:
MCards —
I am so tired of losing my MCard. It’s 

the same thing every time: I go to a din-
ing hall to get food one time because my 
fridge is empty. I sit down, I eat and I 
leave. Two days go by, I open my wallet 
and BOOM. Missing MCard. I have to 
shuffle on down to Pierpont Commons 
or the Student Activities Building to get a 
new one, only to lose it again two months 
later. For all of those who ask, I will never 
wear a lanyard. 

ALSO, I looked ugly in my last photo so 

… it’s an out for me.

Campus Culture’s Ins and Outs of 2021

The Best Books of 2021

MATTHEW EGGERS & KAYA GINSKY
Campus Culture Beat Editor & Daily Arts Writer

After an almost iterative year 

of unpredictability, the Books 
Beat continues to read to ground 
ourselves. Our favorites are 
divided into four categories: 
Literary Fiction, Historical Fic-
tion and Fantasy, Romance and 
Nonfiction (although our picks 
tend to fall into more than one 
category). Mostly released in 
2021 (with a few from the tail-
end of 2020), these titles defined 

our year — we laughed, cried and 
reflected more than we thought 
humanly possible while reading 
these books. The list includes 
titles from veritable literary 
giants like Sally Rooney, Kazuo 
Ishiguro and Hervé Le Tellier, 
TikTok-famous romance nov-
els and critical nonfiction that 
brings light to American con-
tributions to the War on Ter-
ror — we’ve read through it all 
this year. Without further ado, 
here is a list of books that got us 
through 2021.

Literary Fiction

“Beautiful World, Where 

Are You” by Sally Rooney

In our Best of 2020 article, I 

wondered when the “year-long 
wave” of the pandemic would 
finally crest and break. It turns 
out that the wave simply keeps 
going, that we learn to live on 
the wave. But life on the wave is 
still life, complex and stunning 
as ever.

“In the midst of everything, 

the state of the world being what 
it is, humanity on the cusp of 
extinction, here I am writing 
another email about sex and 
friendship. What else is there to 
live for?” says Alice in “Beauti-
ful World, Where Are You,” the 
third novel by Irish author Sally 
Rooney.

The characters of “Beauti-

ful World” expect to meet their 
high-water mark, but instead 
find that the water keeps rising. 
Nearing 30, their lives should 
be happening by now, settled in 

some way, meaningful in some 
way. They’re not. Is the meaning 
still to come, or has the moment 
passed?

The story is not as thrilling 

as “Normal People,” the tone a 
little more relaxed and patient. 
This is the pandemic novel, less 
eventful but more personal for it, 
less exciting but just as emotion-
al. Rooney reminds us that all 
the while, through every end of 
the world, we never fail to seek 
out connection. 

— Julian Wray, Daily Arts 

Writer

“The Anomaly” by Hervé Le 

Tellier

How much can a person 

change in a few months? Also, 
how would the world react to 
learning that life itself is a simu-
lation? Hervé Le Tellier’s “The 
Anomaly” asks both of these 
questions and more, weaving 
complex 
personal 
narratives 

and vast philosophical mus-
ings with ease. Its large cast of 
characters can get confusing, 
especially when the concept of 
a “time-travel doppelganger” is 
introduced. However, these dif-
ferent perspectives serve to cre-
ate a nuanced view of the central 
event of the novel: Referred to 
as “the anomaly,” a plane lands 
— with the same exact crew and 
passengers — in both March and 
June. 

Dystopian and science fic-

tion narratives can often leave 
readers yearning for more — we 
can’t help but crave the reac-
tions of the government, the 
people involved, families, chil-
dren, people from all walks of 
life to the portrayed life-chang-
ing events. This novel gives the 
reader the level of immersion 
that we desire. It follows the 
people in the plane(s), including 
the doppelgangers; it tracks the 
movements of various govern-
ments, even giving us access to 
calls between the Chinese and 
American presidents; it offers a 
seat at the table with the great 
scientific and religious minds as 
they debate what exactly hap-
pened. It is an immensely satis-
fying book, as Le Tellier is able 
to interrogate every aspect, large 
and small, of this “anomaly.” 

A 
book 
about 
something 

so psychologically and philo-
sophically slippery could not, of 
course, be fully satisfying — par-
adoxically, that would feel cheap. 
Luckily, Le Tellier ensures that 

the reader will leave with more 
questions than answers; this is a 
novel I will be thinking about for 
a long time.

Although 
“The 
Anomaly” 

technically came out in 2020, 
the English translation was only 
available in 2021, which feels 
apt — I could only recommend 
an extraordinarily colorful and 
memorable book for a year like 
this. Plus, it offers some com-
fort: At least Le Tellier’s created 
a world that is stranger than our 
own (for now). 

— Emilia Ferrante, Senior 

Arts Editor

“Klara and the Sun” by 

Kazuo Ishiguro

My pick for the best book of 

2021 is Kazuo Ishiguro’s “Klara 
and the Sun.” Following in 
the footsteps of the celebrated 
“Never Let Me Go” and “The 
Remains of the Day,” Ishiguro’s 
most recent novel embodies 
everything that is beautiful and 
unique about the Nobel Prize-
winning author’s writing. 

Set in an urban dystopian 

world, humanoid Klara just 
wants to find a home and a fami-
ly. She is for sale as an “Artificial 
Friend,” placed in the display 
window of a shop overlooking 
a busy street. From her posi-
tion, the hyper-observant Klara 
watches pedestrians passing by 
and seeks to understand human 
behavior. One day, Klara is cho-
sen to be the companion and 
caretaker of young Josie, and 
soon, human and robot form an 
unusual friendship. Later, when 
Josie falls unexplainably ill, 
Klara tries desperately to help 
her.

“Klara and the Sun” is a 

beautifully written story that 
explores a world where artificial 
intelligence plays an integral 
role in everyday human life. Like 
in his previous novels, Ishiguro 
creates a story that is haunting 
and masterfully steeped in emo-
tion. The novel makes you think 
about what it means to love and 
be human, following Klara as 
she navigates the extent of her 
ability to feel and form rela-
tionships as a human creation. 
Unique, strange, unforgettable 
and moving, “Klara and the Sun” 
is one of the best literary works 
that 2021 has to offer.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

2021 was the year artists pulled out the 

big guns. Some of the industry’s heaviest 
hitters released albums that will undoubt-
edly become classics in the years to come. 
In addition, many new and lesser-known 
artists exploded onto the scene last year 
with groundbreaking releases. While in no 
particular order, here is a short list of what 
The Michigan Daily’s very own music writ-
ers believe to be the ten best albums released 
in 2021.

CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST, Tyler, 

the Creator 

After the career milestone of IGOR, hype 

surrounding Tyler, the Creator’s newest 
album was skyrocketing, and he certainly 
did not disappoint. Guiding us through 
another weird and wonderful world was his 
newest alter-ego, Sir Baudelaire. 

While not as fiery and passionate as 

IGOR, Tyler takes on a more relaxed tone: In 
a sense, he’s made it, and now he’s just flex-
ing. The features on the album show again 
how Tyler is still one of the best collabora-
tors in rap right now: The standout track 
“HOT WIND BLOWS” featured a shining 
verse from Lil Wayne, one of his best in a 
while. All of Tyler’s best qualities are pres-
ent in this album, with Tyler himself hav-
ing grown more mature and self-reflective. 
Tyler already has a hell of a career to look 
back on, and I can’t wait to see what he has in 
store for the future.

An Evening With Silk Sonic, Silk Sonic
In an era of pop music where artists often 

seem content to rehash the best (and worst) 
elements of the 1980s, Bruno Mars and 
Anderson .Paak’s decision to look even fur-
ther backward and fully embrace the 1970s 
immediately distinguishes An Evening with 
Silk Sonic — their debut record together as 
Silk Sonic.

Of course, Silk Sonic is also distinguished 

by Mars and .Paak’s unparalleled vocal abili-
ties, which were showcased on the album’s 
electrifying lead-up singles. But what makes 
An Evening with Silk Sonic so special is the 

quality of the project beyond those singles. 
The whole album is masterfully produced 
and features powerful backing instrumen-
tals that perfectly capture different emo-
tions, from the playful wah-wah guitar on 
“Fly As Me” to the somber strings on “Put 
On A Smile.”

Unlike Mars’s previous music — which, 

let’s face it, tends to lose its impact once FM 
radio stations and grocery stores start play-
ing it on loop — the little details of An Eve-
ning with Silk Sonic keep it fresh and make it 
even better with each listen, just like the leg-
endary soul and funk music that inspired it.

Red (Taylor’s Version), Taylor Swift
Red (Taylor’s Version) was one of the most 

anticipated albums of 2021, and it lived up to 
its expectations. Composed of re-recordings 
from Swift’s 2012 Red plus ten bonus tracks 
“from the vault,” Red (Taylor’s Version) 
smashed streaming records, becoming the 
most-streamed album in one day by a female 
artist, with over 90.8 million streams on Spo-
tify. 

“All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Tay-

lor’s Version) (From The Vault),” a fan favor-
ite off the album, also set the record for the 
longest number one song on the Billboard 
Hot 100, overtaking Don McLean’s “Ameri-
can Pie.” The celebration of Swift’s release 
was felt everywhere, with watch parties for 
the “All Too Well (10 Minute Version)” short 
film across the U.S. and even a shoutout from 
the Empire State Building, which lit up red to 
celebrate the album. 

Red (Taylor’s Version), Swift’s second 

re-recorded album in her mission to regain 
ownership of her music, marks an important 
shift in discussions of intellectual property 
and record deals, giving hope to other artists 
who have also suffered losses at the hands of 
record companies.

Promises, Floating Points
When it was first announced that the 

supergroup of Floating Points’s Sam Shep-
herd, Pharoah Sanders and the London Sym-
phony Orchestra would be colliding forces to 
produce a record, there weren’t many people 
without high expectations. For one, it would 
be Pharaoh Sanders’s first album in decades. 
Add to that Floating Points’s excellent recent 
releases and the ingredients seem all laid out 

for a high-quality project. 

Even so, I’m not convinced there were 

many people that predicted the heights that 
the final product would reach. It doesn’t 
feel right to call Promises a classical piece, 
despite the prominent and climactic pres-
ence of the London Symphony Orchestra. If 
anything, it acts more like an ambient record, 
with each movement building off of the same 
motif throughout. Even though Sam Shep-
herd’s compositional acumen was already at 
a high level, the fact that he was also able to 
unlock the fullest potential of his collabora-
tors truly speaks to his progression as a musi-
cal arranger. 

The real star here, however, is Pharaoh 

Sanders’s saxophone work, some of his 
most challenging and legendary to date. He 
effectively acts as the textural centerpiece 
to the project, perfectly utilizing his signa-
ture discordant sound and even his voice 
to puncture through the mystic serenity of 
Shepherd’s production. This truly feels like 
the final jewel in the crown for Sanders. In 
any case, Promises certainly delivers on its 
namesake.

I Know I’m Funny haha, Faye Webster
Atlanta musician Faye Webster harnesses 

her sadness on I Know I’m Funny haha with 
the smoothness of a summertime breeze, 
charged with a golden mixture of warmth 
and melancholy.

Underneath coaxing vocals and steel gui-

tar twangs, Webster’s lyrics are imbued with 
subtle humor and a kind of unhurried hones-
ty you might find in a diary entry. She jumps 
from tales of mind-numbing boredom at the 
absence of a love interest on “Better Distrac-
tions” to the sting of unrequited romance 
with professional athletes on “A Dream With 
a Baseball Player” with unbridled vulner-
ability. Webster doesn’t just write sad songs 
on I Know I’m Funny haha; she fleshes out 
these moments of romantic conflict with full 
understanding of love’s inherent awkward-
ness and unexpected joys.

Webster’s evergreen transparency is 

refreshing and what makes this record a 
mainstay in my rotation. She finds her fair 
share of roadblocks and tears throughout 
the project’s 11 tracks but never loses sight of 
her own journey of self-growth. I Know I’m 
Funny haha is a soulful navigation of love 
and growing up, whose sincerity undoubt-

edly solidifies the album as timeless.

Planet Her, Doja Cat
Doja Cat’s second album, Planet Her, was 

the perfect record to solidify Doja’s spot as a 
top artist in the music industry. 

While viral songs like “MOOO!” and “Say 

So” made Doja a household name, Planet 
Her defined her as a talented singer, rapper 
and performer, even without the memes and 
TikTok dances. Songs like “Need To Know,” 
“Kiss Me More” and “Get Into It (Yuh)” 
trended on TikTok, but where most TikTok 
trends tend to get old quickly, these tracks 
remained just as good after they went viral. 

Watching Doja Cat perform Planet Her at 

various music festivals in the fall of 2021 was 
mesmerizing; Doja knows how to control an 
audience through being a raw, real person 
and having a stage presence that can hypno-
tize anyone. Planet Her is a perfect mixture 
of pop perfection and rap, and Doja’s eight 
Grammy nominations for the record are 
more than well deserved.

The Melodic Blue, Baby Keem
Following two well-received mixtapes 

in the past three years, Las Vegas-raised 
Baby Keem’s debut studio album provides 
an opportunity for the 21-year-old to assert 
himself as one of rap’s future power players. 

Keem definitely has the benefit of a little 

bit of nepotism, as his cousin (and, in this 
writer’s opinion, best rapper alive) Kend-
rick Lamar features on three of the album’s 
tracks. The sheer talent of both artists is 
apparent on these high-quality tracks, with 
“family ties,” serving as a two-faced exercise 
in brilliance with its dueling beats. Keem 
makes great use of collaborators all across 
the album, another highlight being Brent 
Faiyaz’s saccharine verse on “lost souls.” 
Keem doesn’t just lean back on his features, 
though. His output on these songs either 
matches or exceeds the quality of the other 
artists, but his solo moments in the spotlight 
shine as well, such as “16.” If rap fans weren’t 
convinced before, The Melodic Blue should 
be a sufficient signal that Baby Keem is com-
ing, and not much can stop him.

Sometimes I Might Be Introvert, Little 

Simz

Little Simz has been in the music game 

for quite some time, but Sometimes I Might 
Be Introvert has solidified her place in the 
industry. 

Simz lets her listeners into her world, and 

there are many intimate moments that allow 
this album to shine. It listens like a memoir, 
as Simz finds the balance between universal-
ity and specificity to her life experience. Simz 
creates space for introspection on tracks like 
“I Love You, I Hate You” while balancing it 
through moments of gratitude and celebra-
tion on “Woman” and “Point and Kill.” 

Sometimes I Might Be Introvert proves 

that success and a standing ovation from the 
world do not mean being in some grand per-
formance or character. Simz remains true to 
her introverted self and creates an anthem 
for all of us who would rather stay home all 
day.

— Katy Trame, Daily Arts Writer

Vulture Prince, Arooj Aftab
Arooj Aftab’s Vulture Prince deserves a 

spot on any “Best of 2021” lists. The album 
from the Brooklyn-based Pakistani compos-
er spans an impressive number of styles and 
influences while managing to stay cemented 
in Aftab’s breathtaking vocals and impossi-
bly lush instrumentation.

She reaches out suddenly, as the first track 

“Baghon Main” tunes our ears to a cham-
ber of plucking harps and the slow burn of 
Aftab’s silky vocals, and holds you until the 
very second the music stops. Without losing 
our attention for a second, Aftab lulls us with 
each track, bringing us to shattering peaks 
and crystal clear lows. Her vocal range is as 
impressive as the range of instruments and 
musical traditions that make their way onto 
the album. 

The influences vary from Hindustani 

classical, to minimalism, to vocal jazz, invok-
ing the likes of Billie Holiday and dub-reg-
gae on “Last Night.” The comfort, warmth, 
chill, emotion and unrelenting charm of 
Aftab as a vocalist only heighten the pro-
found moments of lyricism and composi-
tion. Devoted to the memory of her younger 
brother, Vulture Prince is a confession of sto-
ries, of lost moments and of love. You would 
be pressed to find music released this year as 
captivating and as immediately beautiful as 
this.

Last year, the slow return to movie the-

aters coincided with the Streaming Renais-
sance, making movies more accessible than 
ever. From long-awaited returns from two 
of Hollywood’s foremost Andersons (Paul 
Thomas and Wes), to boundary-pushing 
international features you may have missed, 
to stage-to-screen adaptations (good and 
bad), 2021 was a great year for movies. In 
no particular order, here are the Film Beat’s 
ten favorite movies of 2021.

“Licorice Pizza”
In the past few years of tumult, I have 

wondered about change. I am changing, you 
are changing, we are all new versions of the 
people we’ve since discarded. All too rare-
ly do I think about the forces behind that 
change — my own agency or just the world 
slowly roiling to shit — nor do I sit down 
and reflect, ponder how change happens or 
where it has left me. 

“Licorice Pizza” performed something of 

a miracle in that it allowed me to experience 
the course of my own enjoyment chang-
ing, welling up even moments after I saw 
it. Maybe it’s just me, but this isn’t a very 
pleasant film. It’s bright and loud and curi-
ous and maybe even a little hopeful at times, 
but it’s tough and queasy and sour too. Only 
after the credits rolled could I breathe a sigh 
of relief and accept a kind of nostalgia that 
can whisk away the darkness.

This is all to say: Maybe we have no 

control over the people we will become 
tomorrow or how content they’ll be. No 
more control than Gary (Cooper Hoffman, 
debut) as he watches his waterbed business 
crumble as the oil crisis sends the cost of 
rubber mattresses through the roof. That 
isn’t to say there aren’t little joys all around 
us worth celebrating. A hug from a crush, 
or a friend, or someone complicatedly both. 
The kinetic rush of a six-wheeler, out of gas 
and trundling down the hilly Hollywood 
streets. A kid actor, smashing a fluffy pillow 
into the face of his obnoxious boss, live on 
TV.

“Licorice Pizza” promises something I’ve 

never considered: These flecks are invisible 
to me right now. There is some happiness 
that can only be uncovered when you look 
back after the storm has beaten you down. I 
hope you will look for them with me, some-
day.

“West Side Story”
Adapting a classic is a tall order, but occa-

sionally you end up with the kind of film 
that outdoes its source material. Following 
the success of the 1957 stage production, 
the original “West Side Story” screen adap-

tation has been beloved since its release 
in 1961, but the film is also a relic of a time 
when Hollywood’s greater vices, specifi-
cally brownface and whitewashing, ran 
unchecked. In the 1961 film, the members of 
the Sharks, the Puerto Rican gang in a turf 
war with the white Jets, were primarily 
played by white men in brown makeup; Rita 
Moreno (“One Day at a Time”), who played 
Anita and won a Best Supporting Actress 
Oscar for her performance, recounted that 
she was also given dark makeup despite 
being Puerto Rican.

This new adaptation, helmed by Ste-

ven Spielberg (“Jaws”), offers a chance to 
right those wrongs. It has all of the flashy 
dance numbers and catchy tunes from the 
original, but with new, thoughtful dimen-
sions to some of its previously overlooked 
characters. Screenwriter Tony Kushner 
(“Lincoln”) rearranges some songs to great 
effect and gives stronger backstories and 
purpose to members of both the Sharks 
and Jets. Tensions between the gangs are 
not framed as fundamental racial and cul-
tural differences; instead, the ever-looming 
threat of the construction of Lincoln Cen-
ter and subsequent gentrification repre-
sent a wider sociopolitical context. The 
Romeo and Juliet love story between Maria 
(Rachel Zegler, debut) and Tony (Ansel 
Elgort, “Baby Driver”), despite being a cata-
lyst for violence between the two gangs, is 
less central to the film because the support-
ing characters are so engrossing. Ariana 
DeBose (“The Prom”) in particular gives a 
stunning performance as Anita: Don’t be 
surprised if DeBose wins a Best Support-
ing Actress Oscar for Anita, 60 years after 
Moreno won hers. This awards season 
has already seen wins and numerous nods 
for Zegler, DeBose and Moreno, as well as 
Spielberg and Kushner.

Moreno is given a new opportunity in 

the remake as Valentina, a replacement 
for a peripheral character in the 1961 film. 
As part of the change, Moreno’s character 
sings the song “Somewhere” at one of the 
emotional turning points of the film. While 
the 1961 version of “Somewhere” is a lament 
between Tony and Maria about their for-
bidden love, Moreno’s version is softer, 
more universal — contemplating what 
divides people, with the hope that someday 
the world will change. It’s this energy and 
reflection that makes “West Side Story” feel 
like a more poignant, less problematic ver-
sion of the 1961 film, and that in and of itself 
elevates it to one of the best films of the year.

“Flee”
“Nary a more guttural noise has escaped 

my lips.” I’m obnoxiously quoting myself. 
That’s what I wrote about my reaction to 
the film “Flee” when it premiered at Sun-
dance Film Festival last year, in regards to 
the laughs and cries and laugh-cries the 

film encouraged and carefully drew from 
my lungs.

That was at the beginning of the year. 

Many moons and many movies later and 
“Flee” has not been ousted as the king of 
kings of kings of movies this past year. 
“Flee” reigns supreme and remains unflag-
gingly unique.

You’re more than likely unfamiliar with 

“Flee,” for the simple fact that it has barely 
graced the silver screen. Picked up by Neon 
(they’re the guys that distributed “Para-
site”) after its smash premiere at Sundance, 
it’s not yet available for streaming and is 
only just making its way to theaters.

It’s got a number of things going for it. For 

one, it’s a smashing story about real events 
(the premise of trueness always ups the ante 
a bit, eh?) in the life of Afghan refugee Amin 
Nawabi — a documentary retelling of just 
one example of what millions of displaced 
and diasporic people have gone through.

And it’s this aspect of the film that justi-

fies its existence as not just a documentary 
but an animated film. Amin Nawabi is a 
pseudonym. Owing to his harried flight 
from Afghanistan, his identity remains con-
cealed by the stylized touch of the animated 
medium, simultaneously serving as a tool 
to both obfuscate and augment the story as 
it alternates between the rotoscoped-pre-
cision of a present-day Amin and the more 
elemental renderings of his whiplashing 
emotional state as his country-hopping past 
is brought to life.

“Flee” is hitting the Michigan Theater 

Jan. 28. Go see it.

“Encanto”
As a proud Disney adult and admirer of 

all things animation, “Encanto” became a 
must-watch for me as soon as it was released 
on Disney+. Like most Disney animated 
films, “Encanto” features an incredibly 
beautiful soundtrack with hits like “Sur-
face Pressure” and “We Don’t Talk About 
Bruno” composed by Lin Manuel Miranda 
(“In the Heights”). This, combined with the 
colorful scenery of an animated Colombia, 
makes for an experience that pleasantly 
awakens all of the senses, and I didn’t want 
it to end.

Watching the film on Christmas day 

with my family reminded me of why movies 
for all ages are so important (and difficult to 
come by). “Encanto” pleases children with 
its irresistible colors, music and a plot that’s 
easy to follow. But it satisfies adults in a dif-
ferent way, with its ability to bring a fam-
ily together in one room and put a smile on 
everyone’s faces. These shared experiences 
are what, at least in my eyes, make films 
special. “Encanto” is relatable to everyone 
in some shape or form, reminding us that 
there is something unique that makes each 
person who they are. While it’s a strong 
message for an impressionable audience of 

younger children, it’s also a message adults 
can benefit from after a year of more fre-
quent self-reflection than usual. We’ve all 
questioned ourselves over the course of the 
pandemic in some capacity as we look for 
something hopeful to grasp onto. “Encan-
to” reminds us to keep searching. There are 
always spontaneous moments of what feels 
like magic embedded in our lives. We just 
have to find and appreciate them. 

— Laura Millar, Daily Arts Writer

“Titane”
I think of myself as something of a safe 

consumer, a creature of habit. I know what 
kinds of movies I like and I tend to stick 
to them: coming-of-age tearjerkers, over-
blown period pieces, slow-going medita-
tions on everyday life, movie musicals. Most 
of my favorite movies are ones I can sink 
into slowly, that envelope me like a weight-
ed blanket.

But “Titane,” my favorite movie of 2021, 

is absolutely none of those things. Direct-
ed by French filmmaker Julia Ducour-
nau (“Raw”) and last year’s winner of the 
Palme d’Or, “Titane” is bold and audacious 
and really fucking gross. Even if it’s also 
strangely sweet at times, its goal is never to 
comfort; it’s all sharp edges and emotional 
whiplash, making it nearly impossible to 
sink into (on the off chance you feel pos-
sessed to do that at all). Its main character 
— a queer, binary-breaking anti-hero(ine) — 
has sex with a car, becomes pregnant with 
the car’s child, goes on a killing spree and 
then assumes a new identity, all in under 
two hours. It’s all gore and body horror and 
unassailable weirdness, the kind of movie 
you might watch, half shied-away, through 
the spaces between your fingers, but find 
impossible to fully turn away from. My jaw 
dropped no more than fifteen minutes in, 
and I couldn’t pick it up until well after the 
credits rolled.

Take it from a self-proclaimed wuss 

with a very low tolerance for gross things: 

“Titane” is not for everyone. It can be a dif-
ficult watch, but it’s also a genius thing — a 
forceful, raw confrontation of masculinity 
and femininity, of family, of losing and find-
ing. It’s not for everyone but, then again, I 
didn’t think it’d be for me. If I haven’t scared 
you off completely, see “Titane” with an 
open mind and know that whatever you’re 
expecting won’t be even close to what you 
get.

— Katrina Stebbins, Senior Arts Editor

“Annette”
“Annette” is the kind of film an artist 

makes when they think they aren’t going to 
make another. Leos Carax’s (“Holy Motors”) 
latest masterpiece feels like a fever dream. 
It is bizarre, depressing and intoxicating in 
all the right ways. Where else can you see 
a character singing while performing oral 
sex, a cheesy parody of crass tabloid news 
shows and a creepy wooden baby puppet 
all in the same film? Adam Driver (“House 
of Gucci”) gives one of the best perfor-
mances of his career, using his physicality 
and presence to create a terrifying portrait 
of a monster losing his mind. It’s the most 
perfect post-“Star Wars” project he could 
have picked — it destroys any notion that 
he’s just Kylo Ren. Driver is one of the best 
actors currently working, not just because 
of his acting talent, but because he’s willing 
to pick weird, challenging roles like this and 
give them everything he has. Every choice 
made in this film is a calculated swing for 
the fences, and while some aspects don’t 
totally work — like its uneven, nonsensical 
plot — it is so refreshing to see a film go for it 
all with such aplomb. People either seem to 
adore or despise this film, and that’s really 
the best compliment you can give it. It gen-
erates a strong reaction from its audience, 
and it doesn’t care whether that’s good or 
bad.

The Orange Bowl game was 
playing on a television behind 

me, visible through a reflection 

on a picture frame. Though 

I couldn’t make out the 

details of the players, 
or 
their 
movements, 

I turned and looked 
back at the screen 
hanging 
over 
the 

bar 
periodically, 

watching 
with 

disappointment 
as Georgia’s score 
increased 
at 
an 

exponentially 
greater rate than 
the Wolverines’.

My 
friends, 

seated beside me 
in a restaurant 
outside 
Minneapolis, 
listened 
to 

my 
frustrated 

commentary 
with a mixture 
of patience and 
annoyance. None 
of 
them 
were 

particularly 
interested in the 
sport. And they 
were 
probably 

alarmed that I, 
someone 
who 

had 
outwardly 

expressed 
my 

dislike of football 
in the past, was 
suddenly 
so 

invested in a game 
occurring 
two 

thousand 
miles 

away. 

I 
was 
the 

only 
University 

of 
Michigan 

student among them. I felt an 
urgent obligation to convey my 
pride in our football team, to make 
them comprehend the enormous 
significance of making it to the 
Orange Bowl despite predictions 
of major losses. My proud remarks 
were a means of reaffirming my own 
connection with the school and its 
underdog success.

As I passed the evening eating food 

and awaiting the arrival of the new 
year with my friends, anticipation 
over the results of the game remained 
at the back of my mind. Just prior to 
midnight EST, the final score put an 
end to our 2021 football success story. 
As I texted my roommate about the 
outcome, my heart sank. It seemed as 
if the illusion of prosperity and school 
spirit I fostered throughout the 2021 
fall semester had shifted. I celebrated 
our entrance into 2022 with my 
friends soon after the end of the 
game, not knowing that the loss to 
Georgia would perhaps be an omen 
for the start of my next semester at 
the University. 

***

We all know the cheer: “It’s great 

to be a Michigan Wolverine!” It’s easy 
for most of us to pick up if someone 
begins chanting it at the Brown Jug, 
on State Street or in the Big House 
student section. But for me, the 
affirmation was slow to ring true. 

Truthfully, most of my college 

experience hasn’t been “great.” 
For the past three semesters I’ve 
attended school here, my feelings 
associated with being a student at 
the University generally ranged 
from neutral to disappointed. There 
was no common tie linking students 
together last year, the virtual barrier 
too big of an obstacle, blocking any 
possibility for building a Wolverine 
network.

At any time during my freshman 

year, starting in the fall of 2020, 
I felt like I was lying when I told 

someone that I was a student at the 
University of Michigan. It was a year 
characterized by a lack of in-person 
classes, minimal official community 
or sports events and a stressful 
residential situation as I was forced 
to find alternative housing outside 
of the dorms a mere two months 
after moving to Ann Arbor. I was 
pushed out of every component of the 
quintessential college experience, 
denied everything former alumni 
had told me to look forward to: South 
Quad-West Quad rivalries, attending 
hockey games at Yost Arena and 
other honored Michigan traditions. 

The result was a disconnect from 

any and all things Michigan: when 
I thought of my status as a ‘college 
student,’ my emotions were a cocktail 
of anger, resignation and sadness. 
I continuously grappled with the 
abysmal state of the world and the 
turbulent decisions made by school 
administration. 

I began my sophomore year with 

tentative enthusiasm — I didn’t want 
to disappoint myself by becoming 
too eager at the prospect of meeting 
classmates 
and 
organization 

members face-to-face, when I knew 
all too well that that opportunity 
could be taken away at any moment.

August 2021: Fully vaccinated 

and utterly unaware of where my 
classrooms were located, I took on 
my real first day of college. I entered 
my first in-person class — a Statistics 
250 lecture — terrified at the prospect 
of talking to strangers around me, or 
finding someone to sit with among 
the mass of people. This recognition 
of my panicked emotions, though 
daunting, also made me smile 
internally. This is what first-time 
college students are supposed to feel 
like, I thought.

I was able to meet with members 

of my student organizations in real 
life, including my Michigan Daily 
meetings. I was amazed that people

actually learned and used my name, 
without reading it below my face on 
a Zoom call. I felt like an integral part 
of the publication team, a sentiment 
I had never experienced with 
virtually-run student organizations. I 
was rejuvenated, ready to contribute 
to the legacy of the renowned student 
paper and carve out my own niche on 
campus with my writing. 

This 
feeling 
of 
newfound 

engagement was a shared experience 
for many U-M students. For LSA 
freshman Jack Pribble, the fall 2021 
semester provided a genuine first-
year college experience, one that 
lived up to even his pre-COVID 
expectations for freshman year. For 
him, “being in person was integral” 
to establishing connections with 
students and engaging with student 
organizations on campus.

“I had a great time meeting a bunch 

of friends, chatting with professors,” 
Pribble said. “Whatever year you 
are, freshman through senior, you 
experienced COVID. And now this 
is kind of a return to normalcy. So I 
feel like everyone was just raring to 
go, everyone was so excited to be a 
collective unit and live their best lives 
with the most entertaining, fulfilling 
year.” 

Though SMTD sophomore Ben 

Martz did have in-person classes in 
the winter 2021 semester to fulfill his 
viola performance major, he hoped 
that the fall semester would allow 
him to be more connected to other 
musicians. 
In-person 
rehearsals 

last year were mainly separated by 
instrumental section, allowing for 
smaller class sizes. 

“Now that I’m physically in 

class and I can sit and be a part of 
the class environment, I’m getting 
to meet these people, different 
instrumentalists and vocalists, and 
there’s more of a network of people 
who know each other,” Martz said. 
“That kind of opens up doors for 
collaborative 
opportunities. 
And 

it’s so much better now that we’re 
all in person, because I think it 
was a lot harder to do those kinds 
of collaborative activities when 
everything was on Zoom, and some 
people were in their respective 
homes around the country, some 
people in their dorms.”

Martz recalled the moments 

from this past semester that made 
him feel most connected to the 
music school, including October’s 
“first (full-orchestra) performance 
in Hill Auditorium,” as opposed to 
recording separately by section and 
combining the parts for a full virtual 
concert. The orchestra’s Halloween 
performance was also a memorable 
event that allowed musicians to 

connect with the audience in a way 
that was impossible to recreate 
during the strictest moments of the 
pandemic. 

“This Halloween concert, it’s an 

Ann Arbor community thing, where 
both students and members of the 
city of Ann Arbor can show up and 
they all wear costumes,” Martz said. 
“And that concert in particular, a lot of 
the stuff that was happening on stage 
was interactive with the audience… 
and Hill Auditorium was completely 
packed. It was really cool to kind of 
feel like what we were doing had a big 
impact on the community, that what 
we were giving to these people was a 
great form of entertainment. And it 
was really obvious that they enjoyed 
it and had a great time there. As a 
performer, that really makes you feel 
like what you’re doing matters.”

Ross junior Megha Kunju said 

that the fall 2021 semester “felt 
most like college pre-pandemic,” 
and as an upperclassman, she feels 
she is even more immersed in the 
campus community than during her 
freshman year.

“A lot has changed, but there is a 

lot of opportunity for growth,” Kunju 
said. “In fact, in an organization 
I’m in on campus right now, we are 
talking about how being virtual really 
helped with accessibility for a lot of 
folks. So, we are trying to implement 
some aspects of our virtual life into 
our organization moving forward. 
I don’t think these conversations 
would have happened during my first 
semester on campus.” 

For transfer students like LSA 

senior Sean Stiles, being online has 
prevented extensive engagement 
with school spirit, but in-person 
interactions have been crucial to his 
feeling connected to other students.

“It was hard to feel connected 

to my work the way I did before I 
transferred and I have struggled 
adjusting to online learning,” Stiles 
said. “I did make some of the best 
friends I have ever had through a 
professional fraternity on campus 
— rush AXE — and these personal 
connections are what I hold onto in 
terms of my school spirit.”

SMTD freshman CC Meade 

noted that in-person rehearsals 
at times made it more difficult to 
engage with other forms of student 
life outside of commitments to the 
Acting Performance major. However, 
she agrees that her in-person classes 
have been “vital” to developing the 
skills she came to the University to 
study.

“If our performances weren’t in 

person, I would not have the same 
experience at all,” Meade said. “It 
is so hard to cultivate an ensemble 

when you can’t physically be there 
with the other people in your group.”

Testimonies like these, found 

across all corners and colleges 
on campus, highlight the shared 
experience we had, arriving at 
a 
tentative 
peace 
despite 
the 

uncertainty of the previous year and 
a half. Campus life was altered by the 
prevalence of hybrid classes, masks 
hiding the facial expressions of new 
classmates and a constant awareness 
of health risks. But we were still 
able to return to regular college 
activities and achieve customary 
milestones. This included one of the 
most prominent of Big Ten college 
traditions: football.

The first sporting event I attended 

as a college student was the football 
game against Western Michigan at 
the beginning of this fall semester. My 
parents encouraged me to purchase 
season tickets, though I didn’t have 
high hopes for the team’s success 
based on last year’s record. I made it 
clear to my friends that I would likely 
leave early from most games if I got 
bored. Nevertheless, I went to the 
first two games, grateful to finally 
take part in a proud Big Ten tradition. 
I thought I could force myself to 
enjoy the sport, if only to be able to 
participate in campus conversations 
surrounding the team’s progress 
throughout the season.

As the season went on, the 

Wolverines’ record became better 
and better. Suddenly, we were high 
in the rankings. I kept attending 
home games even as the weather got 
colder, braving the snow and frigid 
temperatures, eager to continue 
sporting maize and blue alongside 
thousands of my peers. My family 
was shocked when I started to name 
individual players, comprehend the 
specifics of the game and comment 
on particularly good — or bad — 
plays. I began to deeply want the 
team to win, despite my previous 
indifference. 

I was officially a Michigan football 

fan. I was so invested in the team 
that I changed my flight back to Ann 
Arbor during Thanksgiving Break 
from Sunday to Friday night, just so 
I’d make it back in time for our long-
awaited game against Ohio State 
University.

The atmosphere of the student 

section during that game was electric. 
Snow falling and our toes freezing, 
my friends and I sang the student 
cheers in unison with the rest of the 
fans. “It’s great to be a Michigan 
Wolverine!” resounded throughout 
the Big House countless times, 
an assertion of our true pride that 
developed slowly over the season. We 
stood amazed as Michigan outplayed 

OSU in a manner our team hadn’t 
perfected for ten years. 

As time ran out and the score — 42 

points to 27 — confirmed our place 
at the top of the Big East division, an 
overwhelming happiness overtook 
Ann 
Arbor. 
Smiling, 
shouting 

students surrounded me in the 
stadium, joyfully singing along to 
“Seven Nation Army.” Raucous 
cheers would erupt randomly on 
crowded Packard Street after the 
game — the heavy snow continued to 
fall. Though I didn’t make it onto the 
field for the celebration, I savored the 
victory for the rest of the night. 

The pride I had developed for the 

team motivated me to request a ticket 
for the Big Ten Championship in 
Indianapolis, and I was able to watch 
from the stands as the Wolverines 
demolished 
the 
Hawkeyes 
and 

entered the College Football Playoffs 
as the number 2 seed.

The 
football 
team’s 
success 

enhanced my connection to a 
school that previously felt foreign 
when its name sat on my tongue. I 
had never expected to like football 
in college, let alone actually enjoy 
it, making fall 2021 even more of 
a fleeting, unforeseen moment of 
bliss as I took part in activities that 
were nonexistent this time last year. 
Students like Pribble and Stiles share 
similar views on football, seeing it as 
a bridge between them and the spirit 
of the school.

“The experience where I felt most 

connected [to the student body] was 
when I went with friends to Cantina 
during the Iowa versus Michigan Big 
Ten Championship game,” Pribble 
said. “It wasn’t even just the football 
because we were all talking, and 
laughing, and things like that. But 
it was just such a crazy experience, 
and then everyone went out onto 
South University after. Just going 
on Snapchat the next morning just 
seeing everyone posting it out on a 
story made me feel it was like home. 
And I feel like the win definitely 
solidified that feeling.”

“One moment of connection I had 

with the University this semester was 
the Michigan and Ohio State game,” 
Stiles said. “I have never prided 
myself on being a Michigan football 
fan, but I am extremely invested 
in the sport. Walking around the 
stadium before kickoff, with the 
snow coming down, and excitement 
in the air, the feeling of school spirit 
was contagious in a way I had never 
experienced with my own favorite 
teams.” 

It’s this positive association with 

the team, and the connection it 
fostered, that made the Wolverines’ 
defeat in the Orange Bowl all the 

more crushing. The success of the 
team in arguably the most popular 
college sport reaffirmed a unity and 
our status as, in James Earl Jones’s 
words: the greatest university in 
the world. For me, it was less about 
football itself and more with my 
newfound, 
startling 
satisfaction 

with my school, made all the 
more enjoyable by the people who 
accompanied me on each game day.

***

And yet, our fall 2021 in-person 

semester became a beacon in 
the darkness as of recently: the 
undeniably controversial decisions 
made recently by the University 
administration tempered even the 
brightest of college experiences. 
Among these actions is the lack 
of 
recognition 
granted 
to 
the 

survivors of Dr. Robert Anderson, 
a blatant disregard for the victims 
of harrowing abuse within the 
University. The discovery of emails 
detailing a hidden, “inappropriate 
relationship” 
between 
former 

President Mark Schlissel and a 
University employee is yet another 
source of shame and disappointment 
for students. 

With the start of the new year and 

our winter semester, I’ve come face-
to-face with a bitter new reality: the 
harmful actions displayed by those 
who claim to represent the values 
of the school have complicated my 
views of the institution, dimming any 
glimmer of spirit I once felt in the fall. 

Stiles, who works with the 

campus’s “Justice for the 950” social 
activist group, believes that recent 
events have “colored a negative 
image of the University,” nullifying 
any positive occurrences on campus 
we might’ve experienced during the 
fall.

“The victims of Doctor Anderson 

deserve their stories heard, and need 
to be a part of the process of ensuring 
nothing like this can happen again,” 
Stiles said. “This is the least the 
University could do. The fact that 
Mark Schlissel could raise tuition 
prices, cover sexual assault violations 
and sit on billions in endowments, 
but gets fired for inappropriately 
using his University email speaks 
for itself. The University needs to 
start prioritizing its students over its 
donors and money, and that starts 
with giving the survivors a voice at 
the table.”

With the alarming rise of the 

omicron variant and the recent 
dismissal of Schlissel, the winter 
2022 semester quickly proved itself to 
be a continuation of chaos on campus. 
Immediately upon returning to Ann 
Arbor after winter break, the lack 
of University guidelines outlining 

online courses resulted in a jumble 
of online and in-person classes 
amid the rising COVID-19 cases on 
campus. Each instructor individually 
decided whether to remain in person 
or ‘e-pivot’, despite demands from the 
Graduate Employees’ Organization 
to implement a school-wide shift 
to online learning. Those who do 
test positive for COVID-19 continue 
to grapple with isolation housing 
challenges. 

The environment on campus is 

stressful and sporadic — I once again 
feel uncertain, my fragile Wolverine 
identity 
from 
last 
semester 

threatened 
by 
the 
tumultuous 

atmosphere, ready to crack on any 
given school day.

Those I interviewed expressed a 

range of feelings about the current 
semester. For one, Meade said 
she’s “super optimistic about this 
semester.” She continued, “I feel 
much more settled here now and I’ve 
been able to realize what I need to do 
for myself to feel more connected and 
fulfilled here.”

Similarly, 
Pribble 
said 

“going into any semester with a 
pessimistic attitude doesn’t allow 
for the possibility of success,” and 
emphasized 
the 
importance 
of 

staying positive despite outside 
circumstances.

Kunju is “neither optimistic nor 

pessimistic,” and “[tries] to take it 
day by day.” Martz said that “it is a 
little scarier” due to the prevalence of 
omicron and the feeling that, “we’ve 
even regressed a little bit from the 
progress we seemed to be having 
throughout the course of last year.” 

Finally, Stiles is “excited” for his 

final semester, “[hoping to] return to 
in-person classes and social events” 
before entering “post-school life.”

Fall 2021 was replete with myriad 

emotions and special moments, 
shoving all of the quintessential, 
first-time college experiences into 
one eventful semester. It gave us a 
chance to cultivate our identities as 
valuable contributors to the U-M 
community and to take part in the 
spirit that has driven the school for 
over a century. It was a complete shift 
from the previous school year, but the 
experiences were far from perfect 
— the current COVID-19 situation 
just punctuates how ephemeral our 
circumstances can be. 

As students, all we can do is hope 

that the maize-and-blue, glimmering 
memories we made in 2021 aren’t 
fleeting, and that the turmoil 2022 
brought with it doesn’t overshadow 
the milestones to come. If last 
semester taught me anything, it was 
to relish these joyful moments of 
school pride before they slip away.

I’ll bite: Giving into the ‘Twilight’ 
renaissance

The day I moved into my 

dorm and my family left me, I felt 
completely and utterly alone. My 
roommate didn’t move in until 
the next day, and I had just been 
abandoned by the people I had 
grown up with. It was me against 
the world, and the feeling followed 
me around everywhere I went. 

This feeling only built up with the 

revelation that I would have to eat, 
in public, all alone, for the first time 
in my life.

Of all the college experiences 

I had mentally prepared for, this 
wasn’t one of them. As I walked 
down the steps into the Markley 
dining hall, I could already feel 
that familiar gnawing feeling at the 
bottom of my stomach. The room 
was swarming with people. With 
every step, I became more aware of 
my existence: My hair was frizzy, 
my outfit weird, I was sweaty. Every 
tripped step or awkward movement 
around the crammed tables sent a 
surge of anxiety through me that 
was enough to tighten my chest and 
make me shut my eyes. 

There were so many people, so 

many eyes, so many things to focus 
on. I grabbed food, sat at a table 
— my table for one — and hoped I 
would fade into the background. 
What I ate, I couldn’t tell you. I was 
no longer hungry. I ate blindly and 
ran.

In that moment, I felt so guilty. 

This is supposed to be one of the 
most pivotal moments of my life, and 
I was too afraid to eat around other 
people? To my disappointment, my 
dining hall-phobia didn’t improve 
as the semester progressed. When 
I could eat with someone else, I 
would. But whenever I had to eat 
alone I was hyper aware of my 
existence and terrified to move, let 
alone eat.

I suffered in silence for weeks. 

Going to dining halls became a 
pointless venture. I was barely able 
to eat anyway, so I opted for anything 
I could make in the microwave — 
ramen, soup or leftovers. 

In short, I spent a lot of money. 

Every day I thanked myself for 
saving up over the summer, because 
otherwise, I’d be going hungry. Yet 
I never stopped feeling guilty; my 
parents were putting their own 
money toward my dining hall meal 
plan, and my seemingly-irrational 
fear was preventing me from using it. 
Here at the University of Michigan, 
dorm residents are required to select 
one of these dining plans and can’t 
opt out for a monthly allowance. If 
I’d been given the choice, I would’ve 
told my parents to just give me that 
allowance instead.

While I was privileged enough to 

accommodate my phobia, I couldn’t 
help but think about my other peers 
who might not have that option. I 
was lucky to have some spending 
money to buy myself snacks and 
food between my weekly dining hall 
visits, but what if I didn’t? What if 

I was here on scholarship, or need-
based financial aid, and my only 
viable option was to eat in the dining 
halls when I felt that I couldn’t?

These 
thoughts 
about 

inaccessibility had me concerned, 
but as I assumed I was alone in this 
feeling, I didn’t think much further 
on it. 

The first time I realized my 

dining 
hall-phobia 
was 
not 

entirely rare was a dreary winter 
morning in English 140, when we 
were 
discussing 
inaccessibility 

on campus. I volunteered how I 
found it hard to eat in dining halls, 
as they had the tendency to make 
me anxious. I was surprised when 
nearly the entire class agreed; almost 
every person had an experience in a 
dining hall that had made them feel 
uncomfortable, or kept them from 
eating.

So how big of an issue is this?
When I decided to write this 

piece and look for people to talk to, 
I was overwhelmed by the sheer 
amount of responses I received. 
While not all students were ready 
to be interviewed, countless fellow 
dining hall-phobes expressed their 
discontent with eating in the erratic 
environment.

LSA sophomore Alex Ngyuen 

talked to me about his time spent 
in the dining halls, but most 
importantly, about what he had 
been doing to avoid eating in them 
entirely.

When it was announced that the 

University was going online for the 
rest of the Winter 2020 semester, 
I remember exactly where I was. I 
was laying on my stomach playing 
Apex Legends when my housemate, 
Maggie, practically busted down 
my door. Her eyes were wide as she 
pushed her phone out to show me the 
email. The only thing I could say back 
was:

“Duuuuuuude.”
I couldn’t believe what I was 

reading. The concept of the world 
temporarily shutting down was 
surreal to me. For the rest of the day, 
I aimlessly wandered around my 
room, dragging my feet along the 
blue carpet below me just to feel a 
little something. The next couple of 
days seemed to blur together, from 
my classes moving online to most of 
my friends leaving Ann Arbor to go 
back home. My friends that would 
relax in my room were now nowhere 
to be seen, and there was a notable 
emptiness. 

There had been a buzz in my 

theatre department class group chat 
about our entire situation. People 
expressed their shared loneliness, 
fears of the world and a prospect that 
stuck out to me most: cat adoptions. 
My entire class was slowly but surely 
making plans to adopt cats. 

I told myself I would never get a pet 

in college because it was irresponsible, 
but the timing just seemed right. To 
have a furry little friend that naps 
most of the time and plays with yarn 
seemed to be the perfect solution 
to pandemic-induced depression. I 
called my friend Sophia to confirm 
that we were on the same page.

“Should we… get a kitty for our 

house?”

“UH, FUCK YEAH. LET’S 

GET A LITTLE COVID 
KITTY!”

We didn’t get a 

Covid Kitty(™) 

immediately, but it stayed on my 
mind throughout the sweaty months 
of June and July. As the beginning of 
August rolled around, we made our 
way to the Humane Society of Huron 
Valley to pick out a furry little friend 
for us to raise. The one we found was 
a tiny grey and white kitten with the 
biggest green eyes I had ever seen. 

“That one — like, of course that 

one,” my housemate and I exclaimed 
unanimously. 

We proceeded to go through the 

paperwork while the lady at the front 
desk explained to us that the kitten 
was feral, meaning he was incredibly 
shy and unsocialized. I acknowledged 
this with a brief head nod and verbal 
grunt, but she was unsatisfied with 
my response.

“Are 
you 
sure 
you 
feel 

comfortable being able to take care 

of this cat?” she pressed. 
“How many students live 
in this house with you?”

The answer was seven: seven 

queer theatre students trying to keep 
both toilets from clogging in a World-
War-II-era house. I understood why 
she was questioning me. I was a tired 
college student wearing elephant-
print sweatpants and a ripped up ‘My 
Hero Academia’ t-shirt. 

It was a big task to take care of an 

animal, but I knew that I was capable 
and responsible enough. I explained 
how I had worked with a couple 
animal shelters in the past and knew 
how to coexist with underdeveloped 
and ‘difficult’ animals. Our cat would 
be taken care of, we assured her. 

After the extensive and slightly-

tense dialogue between us and the 
inquisitive front desk lady, we were 
finally able 
to adopt our new 

little 
mister — we 

named 

him 

“Espurr” after the Pokemon. But 
the lady’s questioning did leave me 
feeling worried about the adoption 
experience. I was fearful that I was 
being selfish about adopting an 
animal, that Espurr would be better 
off back at the Humane Society.

I arrived home and was hit with 

this feeling of fear even harder. As 
soon as I let my new friend out of his 
carrier, Espurr bit my hand and hid, 
obviously not acclimated to human 
interaction. That first night I cried on 
the same blue carpet, petrified of the 
thought of a cat who didn’t like me at 
all. For the next month, he would hide 
under a huge blanket, hissing at any 
person who walked by. Sophia and 
I had to forcibly wrap him in a towel 
before petting him for twenty minute 
intervals in order to acclimate him 
to human touch. Through all of this 
he would yowl and cry, leaving me 
to wonder whether or not I was even 
helping him.

Espurr eventually came around 

to love me, but I became curious of 
the other experiences the lady at the 
front desk had had with college-aged 
adopters, and why exactly there were 
so many college students adopting a 
pet, specifically a cat, during this time 
of crisis.

A speedy Google search affirmed 

my suspicion that my roommate and 
I were not the only burnt-out but well-
intentioned college students seeking 
a furry feline to keep them company 
mid-quarantine. 

In 
a 
study 
published 
by 
the 
Frontiers 

in Veterinary Science, researchers 
determined that since 2019, the web 
searches for pet adoptions have 
highly increased: “the RSV (relative 
search value) ratio (2020/2019) for 
both dog and cat adoption increased 
by up to 250%.” I also found an NPR 
interview where Cornell University’s 
Elizabeth Berliner claims: “There’s 
some statistics that represent that 
1 in 5 pet owning homes adopted a 

new pet during the pandemic. And 
so we do have concerns about what 
this adoption season will look like in 
2021.”

Moreover, the effect of everyone 

being confined to quarantine has 
created a new ‘generation’ of pets: a 
group of pets who have spent most of 
their time inside with their humans. 
While this wave of new quarantine 
companions has provided much-
needed comfort, some worry about 
how these recent adoptees will adapt 
to post-pandemic pet life. 

Researchers state that: “There is 

a concern for separation anxiety and 
possible abandonment of these newly 
adopted pets when the owners leave 
their homes for work in the future.” 
This sudden change in routine results 
in either a miserable pet, a miserable 
owner, or both. 

If this were the case, I wondered, 

were there an abundance of pets 
being returned after owners realized 
they were in over their heads? While 
exact rates of adoption returns vary 
from region to region, there did 
appear to be an overall increase in 
returns at the start of the pandemic. 
The Animal Care Centers of NYC 
“saw 1,393 animals brought to them 
last month (June 2021), more than 
twice the number of dogs and cats 
surrendered in February.” In the 
Dallas area, cats and their kittens 
were being left in bags on doorsteps in 
this same timeframe.

With this horrifying information 

in mind, I decided to ask people 
my own age, those of the infamous 
‘College Student Who Bought Cat 
In Pandemic’ demographic, to see 
what their experiences were like, 
fiscally and emotionally, throughout 
the adoption and post-adoption 
processes.

The normalization of President 

Biden’s necropolitics is as new as 
the sky is blue. Already, I can hear 
the 
neoliberal 
back–to–brunchers 

briskly brandishing their rational-
izing remarks — their ostentatious 
retorts of “reform.” Yet what these 
prideful preachers fail to grasp is the 
sheer fact that the Biden abomination 
— sorry, administration, is not a real 
repudiation of Trump’s but instead 
a perpetuation of his legacy…which, 
of course, was a mere continuation 
of the Obama administration and 
his antecedents’ undying devotion 
to capital exploitation and the white 
power structure. 

Indeed, during Biden’s first 365 

days, we’ve witnessed a grotesque 
perpetuation of racialized immigra-
tion policies. There’s been a con-
tinuation of kids in cages, yet the 
outrage is over. The total number of 
immigrants in detention centers has 
increased by over 50%. Mass incar-
ceration remains, as political scholar 
Siddhant Issar posits, “a significant 
mechanism through which the state 
manages surplus populations and 
the social and economic crises pre-

cipitated by neoliberal restructur-
ing.” This was undeniably evident 
in 2021, as Biden’s administration 
delivered over a million deportations 
(including the inhumane expulsions 
of Haitian asylum-seekers). The only 
figure matching that is the millions 
of dollars this administration has 
put towards police funding, in addi-
tion to the continued fostering of the 
Department of Defense’s 1033 pro-
gram which maliciously militarizes 
the police, continuing to endanger 
the lives of Black and Brown peoples 
across the nation.

Last year, Kyle Rittenhouse’s ver-

dict for the racialized murder of two 
men was met with well-warranted 
wrath. But I must ask, where is this 
energy for the executive-in-chief? 
Our modern American culture is 
remarkably prone to idolizing our 
political figures. Not only do we 
rationalize these ruling-class world-
renowned killers, we regularly glo-
rify them, putting them on a pedestal 
as if they aren’t indirectly facilitating 
the same violence which we claim to 
abhor (on a larger systematic scale 
at that). Rejecting abolition and de-
carceral alternatives, we perpetuate 
our insistent urge to individualize 
systemic issues. In the face of inter-
personal justice, we ardently advo-
cate for incarceration rather than 
assessing material conditions and 
social contradictions on a broader 
structural level.

Peering out abroad, we’ve seen 

a perpetuation of imperialism as 
an imperative, with sanctions on 
Afghanistan 
and 
Venezuela 
and 

Cuba, and political destabilization 
attempts on Nicaragua. A perpetua-
tion of AFRICOM, and the militari-
zation of Afrika and the Middle East 
persists, continuing under the guise 
of “counterterrorism.” These sadis-
tic sanctions and subversion machi-
nations beget disastrous starvation, 
economic deprivation and senseless 
death. 

And let us not forget the perpetu-

ation of our planetary peril, as this 
administration’s lackluster cluster 
of climate change policies has only 
intensified the climate crisis as Biden 
issues large-scale permits for oil and 
gas drilling rivaling that of Trump’s 
first three years. Not to mention the 
avid increase in military spending 
(which remains one of the most sig-
nificant contributors to the climate 
emergency) has resulted in $778 bil-
lion towards “defense” in the name of 
“Build Bombs Better” — sorry, “Build 
Back Better.”

Meanwhile, 
Biden’s 
supporters 

continue to perpetuate and plaster 
his placative reform policies as if they 
aren’t another rudimentary ruling-
class strategy to temporarily resolve 

the inherent antagonisms within the 
capitalist system. Ultimately, none of 
these policies do anything to alter the 
material conditions of the working 
class or address the harrowing crises 
of housing and health care, education 
and the environment, all of which 
continue to be exacerbated during 
the pandemic. 

You know, the pandemic… during 

which the Biden presidency has seen 
unprecedented levels of death and 
dismay as we surpass 1.35 million 
(recorded) cases (in a day). Despite 
vaccinations, 2021 saw more COVID-
19 deaths than 2020. Now, the safe-
ty precautions many people took 
against coronavirus at the beginning 
of the pandemic have been thrown 
out the window. The pandemic wages 
on, yet those of us with privilege sim-
ply do not care as we stumble back 
into packed parties, stadiums and 
bars. It seems to me, especially as the 
new Omicron variant is prolonged, 
that for some all along, “prioritiz-
ing safety” through mask mandates, 
quarantining and other acts of col-
lective care was a mere performative 
political maneuver manufactured by 
the (neo)liberal media apparatus in 
opposition to reactionary right-wing 
sentiments. Evidently, some saw the 
Biden victory and vaccinations as a 

route to “return to normalcy” in more 
ways than one. Yet since Inaugura-
tion Day, the pandemic and all of the 
social problems persisting prior to 
his presidency remain interminably 
perpetuated, augmented and ampli-
fied. 

Of course, underlying all of this is 

the feeble collective forgetting that 
our president, much like his prede-
cessors, is a former collaborator and 
current unapologetic sympathizer 
of segregationists, an architect of 
modern-day mass-incarceration, not 
to mention an alleged abuser — all of 
which was widely accessible infor-
mation prior to Election Day.

And while nationwide disjunctive 

syllogism and the pervading false lib-
eral-conservative dichotomy might 
be to blame for the dissonance then, 
we must now renounce our flawed 
allegiance to party politics and U.S. 
electoralism as a whole.

As Malcolm X once proclaimed, 

“Any time you throw your weight 
behind a political party that controls 
two-thirds of the government and 
that party can’t keep the promise 
that it made to you during election 
time and you’re dumb enough to walk 
around continuing to identify your-
self with that party, you’re not only 
a chump but you’re a traitor to your 
race.” 

If this is the case, then what can we 

do? We can start by asking ourselves 
how we might be actively contribut-
ing to harm in our every-day lives. 
What actions might we take that are 
oriented to the dictates of capital? 

We can think more critically and 

consciously about the media we con-
sume, the brands we endorse or the 
causes we rally behind. We may con-
sider re-directing our career paths 
away from profit, away from exploi-
tation, thus, re-affirming our com-
mitments to justice by prioritizing 
the empowerment of all peoples in 
our professional pursuits. We might 
routinely ask ourselves how we can 
better situate our values and beliefs 
towards liberation in every aspect of 
our existence. 

We can invest in community and 

collective care, mutual aid networks 
and 
revolutionary 
organizations 

(such as Black Alliance for Peace). 

We can devote ourselves to habitu-

ally engaging with revolutionary 
readings and radical written works 
that have been so vigorously sup-
pressed from mainstream discourse. 

We can align our artistic passions 

and political perspectives in ways 
that push back against capitalist ide-
ology and the white power structure. 

We can begin all of this today. We 

don’t have to wait for a midterm. We 
don’t have to wait for 2024. We can 
reject the Biden abomination now

I’m an avid supporter of 

Kendrick Lamar’s music. 
My friends and family all 
know this. I play his music 
when I’m at home or in the 
car, and I am always quick 
to proclaim him as one of 
the best rappers of all time 
since his music inspires 
me to find my own artistic 
voice and become a better 
storyteller of my own life.

Kendrick is part of the 

Los 
Angeles-based 
label 

Top Dawg Entertainment 
(TDE), which houses other 
music industry stars like 
SZA, ScHoolboy Q and Isa-
iah Rashad. I was such a 
huge fan of Kendrick that 
for my 16th birthday, I made 
sure to order a TDE hood-
ie in support of the 2017 
album DAMN., his much 
anticipated follow-up to To 
Pimp a Butterfly. DAMN. 
was released on April 14, 
2017. My siblings and I 
were able to witness Kend-
rick perform the album live 
on tour in Detroit. Even 
though we were sitting in 
the nosebleeds, I will never 
forget that night. I was able 
to rap along to some of my 
favorite 
Kendrick 
songs 

like “Money Trees,” and 
halfway through perform-
ing “HUMBLE.,” Kendrick 
stopped and let the entire 
stadium rap the rest of the 
song. He even brought out 
J. Cole as a surprise guest 
to perform. The energy 
in The Palace was elec-
tric. Kendrick and J. Cole 
on the same stage? Up to 
this point in their careers, 
they had been teasing more 
music and another collabo-
ration, but all us fans had 
gotten was the song “Black 
Friday.” Seeing two of the 
greats share the same stage 
was unforgettable. 

It’s been four long years 

since the release of DAMN., 
and while fans like me 
patiently await new materi-
al from Kendrick, I’ve gone 
back and relistened to some 
of my favorite records of his. 
When revisiting Kendrick’s 
sophomore album, good kid 
m.A.A.d city, he name drops 
two very important cities in 
the opening track, “Sher-
ane a.k.a Master Splinter’s 
Daughter.” Kendrick dis-
cusses his youth and trying 
to see a girl he was inter-
ested in as he raps, “‘Where 
you stay?’ she said, ‘Down 
the street from Dominguez 
High’ / Okay, I know that’s 
borderline Compton or Par-
amount / ‘Well, is it Comp-
ton?’ ‘No,’ she replied.” 

Three things stand out to 

me in these lyrics: Comp-
ton, Paramount and Domin-
guez High.

Kendrick 
Lamar 
was 

born in Compton, Califor-
nia and I was born in Para-
mount, California. These 
two cities located in Los 
Angeles County are adja-
cent to one another and 
divided by the Los Ange-
les River. Looking through 
family photos of my early 
childhood 
in 
Paramount 

helps me understand pieces 
of my story, and discover-
ing old family photos is like 
finding a missing puzzle 
piece. I get closer to under-
standing the full picture of 
my life story one photo at a 
time. There’s this picture of 
my siblings and me posted 
up right next to the Los 
Angeles River that always 
reminds me of my lifelong 
bond I have with my older 
siblings. Here we are, at the 
borderline between Comp-
ton and Paramount, enjoy-
ing a nice evening walk 
along the river.

Kendrick also references 

Dominguez High School, 
which was also only a 
12-minute walk from our 
house on San Marcus St. 
When you can visualize and 
understand 
the 
meaning 

behind the lyrics to songs, 
it makes the listening expe-
rience so much more enjoy-
able and relatable. 

good kid m.A.A.d city 

tells the story of a young 
Kendrick Lamar growing 

up in Compton, California 
surrounded by the harsh 
realities of gang violence 
and 
substance 
abuse 
in 

a city that he still dearly 
loves. In the final verse of 
the closing victory lap of a 
track, “Compton,” Kend-
rick raps, “Now we can all 
celebrate / We can all har-
vest the rap artist of N.W.A 
/ America target our rap 
market, as controversy and 
hate / Harsh realities we in 
made our music translate.” 
The genre of rap gave indi-
viduals like Kendrick, Dr. 
Dre and Ice Cube an avenue 
to tell their life experi-
ences, and in the process of 
doing so, they received crit-
ical acclaim and success. As 
a testament to this success, 
Kendrick became the first 
rapper and non-classical or 
-jazz musician to win the 
Pulitzer Prize for music in 
2018.

Since my family moved 

to Michigan just before 
I turned five, I only can 
vaguely recall my life in 
California. Memories that 
remain ingrained in my 
mind, 
however, 
are 
the 

times my family went to 
the Santa Fe Springs Swap 
Meet at night to enjoy food 
and carnival games. Under 
the bright California moon-
light, families enjoyed Fer-
ris wheel rides and live 
music while eating elote 
and sharing tacos on sty-
rofoam plates. Using mer-
chandise, vendors created 
an entire maze within the 
Swap Meet for families to 
buy toys, clothes, art and 
decorations. 
The 
Swap 

Meets had it all. Here’s a 
picture of my mom and me 
at our own shop in the Par-
amount Swap Meet. 

We sold toy model cars 

ranging from yellow school 

buses, Dodge Vipers, Mus-
tangs and Lowriders. So 
many 
classic 
Lowriders. 

I remember I used to love 
playing with those cars at 
home on my little carpet 
race track. When I listen to 
Kendrick’s music, it bleeds 
west coast hip-hop: from 
the funky George Clinton 
G-funk inspired bass lines 
on “Wesley’s Theory” to the 
off-kilter flows on “family 
ties”, I begin to feel nostal-
gic for California. Memo-
ries and feelings of what 
life was like for my family 
in Paramount echo through 
my mind.

Thankfully, I learn new 

things about my life in Los 
Angeles through the stories 
my family has shared. My 
brother tells me that one 
time when he was 8 years 
old, his school had to ini-
tiate a lockdown because 
someone running from the 
cops had decided to run 
through the school court-
yard. My sister recalls buy-
ing helado from the local 
street vendor who would 
stroll in front of our house. 
My dad tells stories of his 
experiences being racially 
profiled by cops. My mom 
also recounts the event 
that compelled her to learn 
how to drive. One day, Mom 
was at the bus stop having 
a conversation with her 
friend. Her friend told her 
that on the previous day, 
ICE had raided that exact 
same bus stop. Through-
out the 1980s, Mexican and 

Central American commu-
nities in Los Angeles faced 
the federal government and 
their aggressive immigra-
tion raids that took place 
in homes, bus stops, night 
clubs, agricultural fields 
and warehouses. Sadly, the 
fear of potential ICE raids 
still haunts communities 
today. In our time in Los 
Angeles, we were part of 
the Mexican community. 
We ran our own Swap Meet 
stand, sold Lowrider toy 
model cars and hats and 
shirts with the word “Low-
rider” that I still wear to 
this day — it can’t get more 
L.A. than that. 

Thinking back to where 

I was born and where my 
family lived for so many 
years gives me a stronger 
appreciation for Paramount 
and Kendrick Lamar, since 
my family was part of this 
greater Black and Brown 
community that has shaped 
Los Angeles culture. You 
can’t talk about Los Ange-
les without mentioning the 
impact of Mexican and Cen-
tral American communi-
ties. I’m inspirewd to learn 
more about my Mexican 
identity when I spend time 
reflecting on the fact that 
my family was part of an 
environment so important 
and influential to an art-
ist like Kendrick. I’m even 
more inspired to continue 
learning about my identity 
because Kendrick has con-
tinually shown support and 
love for the Latinx com-
munity. On Aug. 20, 2012, 
Kendrick tweeted, “This is 
LA. I love all my extended 
Latino families. Their mor-
als their culture. This is 
California.” 

Kendrick’s love for his 

extended 
Latinx 
fam-

ily goes far beyond just a 

tweet. When Baby Keem 
and 
Kendrick 
dropped 

their music video for the 
song “family ties,” I was 
blown away by the four-
minute song’s editing and 
the scenes. Throughout the 
entire music video, differ-
ent clips of Keem and Kend-
rick rapping are layered on 
top of each other. I would 
describe the music video as 
having multiple windows 
open on your computer 
desktop except, instead of 
a browser, you have clips of 
Keem and Kendrick. At the 
3:30 minute mark, Kend-
rick raps in front of EZ Cuts 
Barber Shop wearing a som-
brero and what looks like 
a denim zoot suit. Here’s 
a behind the scenes shot 
courtesy of Compton native 
and artist, Lil L. 

When I first saw this 

scene in the music video, 
I had the biggest smile on 
my face. It may look goofy 
or seem out of place, but to 
me, it’s so cool that Kend-
rick is proudly wearing the 
traditional 
Mexican 
hat. 

The sombrero is heavily 
tied to and associated with 
Mexican culture, as it can 
be seen being worn by the 
legendary Mexican singer 
Vicente Fernández Gómez. 
The wide-brimmed hat is 
unmistakable, and I’m sure 
you’ve seen it somewhere 
being associated with a 
mustachioed Mexican guy 
eating tacos and wearing 
a poncho — but just know 
that it’s much more than 

that. 
People 
in 
Central 

America needed to create 
the sombrero to combat 
the harsh sun they dealt 
with on a daily basis. It’s 
such a strong symbol asso-
ciated with Mexican cul-
ture and I’m happy that it’s 
being worn by Kendrick in 
a music video that has been 
seen by 38 million people. 

In 
the 
“family 
ties” 

video, Kendrick is referenc-
ing the sombrero in a more 
tasteful manner as he pairs 
it with the classic zoot suit 
that has its own history 
and connection to Black 
and Latinx communities of 
Los Angeles due to the Zoot 
Suit Riots. The zoot suit has 
historic ties to the Mexican 
American neighborhood of 
East Los Angeles and the 
Black 
neighborhoods 
of 

Watts because, during the 
1930s and ‘40s, this style of 
dress was popular among 
Black and Latinx commu-
nities. These individuals 
would go on to call them-
selves 
“Pachucos;” 
how-

ever, conservative citizens 
were quick to label Mexi-
can 
Americans 
wearing 

the suits as criminals and 
gangsters, 
weaponizing 

the word and using it in a 
derogatory manner. 

Zoot suits would be fur-

ther criminalized during 
World War II when they 
were banned in 1942 due 
to the rationing of wool, 
and those who continued 
to wear the suits were seen 
as unpatriotic. Four days 
after a physical alterca-
tion between U.S. sailors 
and zoot-suiters on June 
3, 1943, about 50 U.S. sail-
ors targeted zoot-suiters 
in Mexican American com-
munities with makeshift 
weapons. This sparked the 
Zoot Suit Riots, which last-

ed until June 8, and during 
this time, Latinos and Black 
Americans were the victims 
of attacks led by racist riot-
ers. Once the riots calmed 
down, Governor Earl War-
ren created a committee to 
investigate the cause of the 
riots. It was determined 
that racism, biased media 
coverage and poor response 
by the Los Angeles Police 
Department were mainly to 
blame.

Clearly, Kendrick Lamar 

cares enough about the sig-
nificance of the zoot suit 
to wear one in the “fam-
ily ties” music video, and I 
personally love it. The con-
sistent appreciation that he 
shows in his work towards 
the Latinx communities of 
L.A makes me an even big-
ger fan of him. From eating 
elote in a palm tree to start 
off the music video for the 
Grammy 
Award-winning 

song “King’s Dead” to rap-
ping the start of his verse of 
“Collard Greens” in Span-
ish, Kendrick is showing 
support.

Knowing the history and 

influence Mexican Ameri-
cans have had and continue 
to have in the city of Los 
Angeles makes me proud to 
be Mexican American and 
born in Paramount, Cali-
fornia. Wherever life takes 
me, I know that I have that 
love for L.A. and the L.A. 
history is in my blood and 
DNA — just like it’s in Ken-
drick Lamar.

M

y 
whole 
life 
I’ve 

struggled with mental 
health. 

As a child, sometimes I would 

start feeling really sad and I wouldn’t 
know why.

When I was about 8 years old, 

my parents got me a royal blue iPod 
Nano. It had my Dad’s music library 
— mostly dad rock and some stuff 
from the 90s.

Among the selection was U2’s 

1988 
hybrid 
live/studio 
album 

Rattle and Hum. The album’s final 
song, a ballad called “All I Want Is 
You,” is about love, heartbreak and 
broken promises, things you don’t 
typically have much real experience 
with when you’re 8. All I really 
understood about this ballad was 
that it was tragic.

When I used to dip into this 

unexplainable sad place, I would 
listen to it on repeat. I can vividly 
remember sitting on a bus to 
summer 
camp, 
alone, 
isolated 

from my friends, feeling off and 
disconnected from myself and those 
around me — not knowing why but 
just wanting to be alone. 

“All I Want Is You” provided me 

with catharsis and a way to explore, 
feel and embrace this darker side 
of myself that as a child I didn’t 
understand, but looking back, I 
needed it greatly. When I wanted to 
be alone, the song gave me a place to 
hide and feel what I needed to feel; it 
gave me “a river in a time of dryness, 
a harbor in the tempest.”

As I got older, I started to have 

anxiety. Sometimes it was crippling; 
obsessive. In high school, there was 
one girl in particular who, after she 
rejected me for my best friend at 
the time, made walking the halls of 
school a terrifying experience. I was 
always panicked, constantly trying 

to make it to my next class as fast as 
I could so that I wouldn’t pass her by 
chance.

Eventually, it got to the point 

where it constantly felt like there 
was a massive pit in my stomach. 
It was the kind you get before a big 
performance or test, but I felt it 
almost every day.

At the end of my sophomore 

year of high school, I got into a big 
fight with my mom over something 
probably very stupid, and in the heat 
of the argument, she suggested I go 
see a therapist.

And to spite her, I did. 
At my first session, I was cautious. 

I wasn’t sure if I was ever going to 
go to another appointment, but I 
actually ended up liking it. It was 
just a conversation with someone 
who made you feel understood 
and offered their advice. It was like 
having a friend, the only difference 
being that you paid them.

So I kept going for almost two 

years.

And it was a godsend. High school 

was a tough time for me, as I’m sure 
it was for many others, but in the 
good times and the bad, my therapist 
was there for me and helped me 
manage my mental health. She also 
helped me through some of the 
lowest moments of my life. There 
were times I was so depressed that 
those once-a-week sessions were 
really all I looked forward to. 

Eventually though, it came time 

for me to leave the nest. I went 
to college and stopped seeing my 
therapist, believing that it was time 
for me to venture forth on my own 
— a conviction that my therapist 
agreed with. I had improved my 
mental health, bettered myself.

But from time to time, I still 

struggle. I still go to that sad place. 
Earlier this year I reached back out to 
my therapist. I wanted to meet with 
her again, but on a more irregular 
basis. She told me that because of 

the huge increase in demand for 
therapy onset by the pandemic, she 
was overbooked and couldn’t see 
me, and advised me to contact the 
University of Michigan’s Counseling 
and Psychological Services (CAPS).

So I did. 
For context, the CAPS process 

starts with a mental health history 
questionnaire, 
and 
then 
you 

schedule an initial consultation. It 
took me two weeks to get an initial 
consultation, which is kind of a 
repeat of the questionnaire. It really 
was just an appointment where 
someone asks you questions about 
your history with mental health and 
therapy to get a read on how urgently 
you need to be seen. They ask you if 
you have a history of violence, self-
harm, substance abuse, etc.

During this consultation, they 

inform you that CAPS is not really 
therapy, as students attend an 
average of only 3.5 sessions and 
usually do not go to more than five. 

It’s also not in person because of 
the pandemic; it’s conducted over 
the phone — you can’t do Zoom or 
FaceTime either. With this virtual 
form of counseling, the multitude 
of 
benefits 
from 
face-to-face 

communication are lost.

If you’re still interested at this 

point, they’ll inform you that they 
can schedule an appointment for you 
but the wait time could be between 
three and six weeks, depending on 
availability. I was still interested, 
thinking that the unexplained 
sadness I had been feeling might 
resurface at that time and that a 
session would be helpful.

About a month later, I had my 

appointment, coincidentally being 
in that sad place again. The therapist 
I was assigned to spent the first 15 
minutes of the call talking to me 
about what they could offer me.

L

ast 
summer, 
when 

President 
Joe 
Biden 

proclaimed to Ameri-

cans that we were “closer than 
ever to declaring our indepen-
dence” from COVID-19, it seemed 
unfathomable the nation would 
find itself in the throes of yet 
another pandemic surge just six 
months later. Yet, here we are 
again. Even with over 500 mil-
lion vaccines administered across 
the country — and over 70% of 
Americans age 12 and older fully 
vaccinated — COVID-19 has once 
again upended daily life. By some 
measures, 2022 feels eerily like 
2020 all over again.

The current surge is fueled 

by the highly-contagious omi-
cron variant of COVID-19, which 
has spread through the nation at 
unprecedented speeds and sent 
case counts to dizzying heights. 
On Jan. 10, health officials report-
ed 1.48 million new cases, more 
in a single day than at any other 
point in the pandemic, shatter-
ing the previous record set just 
days before. With the explosion 
in cases has come a spike in hospi-
talizations, pushing many health-
care facilities, doctors and nurses 
to the brink. In Michigan, hospi-
tals across the state are near or at 
capacity as pandemic hospitaliza-
tions break records.

In the midst of all this, some 

governments are responding with 
the harsh tactics we’ve all become 
familiar with over the past two 

years. In Canada and Europe, 
which face similar surges, gov-
ernments have instituted a slew 
of measures including lockdowns 
and closures of schools and busi-
nesses to combat the spread. 
Though it may seem at first glance 
that current conditions warrant a 
similar move by President Biden 
and governors across the country, 
it’s critical we update our COVID-
19 game plan and avoid the same 
traps we’ve fallen into before.

As alarming as the latest pan-

demic metrics are, they have to 
be put into perspective. First and 
foremost, experts believe the 
omicron variant — which now 
accounts for over 98% of new 
COVID-19 cases in the country 
— is less severe than previous 
strains like delta. A new study 
found patients who contracted 
omicron were 53% less likely to 
require hospitalization and over 
90% less likely to die than those 
who suffered from the delta vari-
ant. As in earlier waves, Ameri-
cans who are fully vaccinated 
continue to have a good progno-
sis. While omicron has evaded 
some of the vaccine’s protection 
against symptomatic infection, 
the vaccines are still extremely 
protective against severe dis-
ease. A booster shot, which more 
Americans are receiving every 
day, bolsters protection further. 
Following Canada and Europe’s 
lead and shutting down schools, 
colleges and businesses as cases 
surge simply isn’t supported by 
the data.

Returning to harsher contain-

ment measures wouldn’t only 

be unwise because omicron is a 
milder variant relative to earlier 
strains of COVID-19. Omicron is 
also wildly transmissible, even 
more so than the highly-infec-
tious delta variant. In the early 
days of the pandemic, closing 
down large sectors of the coun-
try proved to be an effective tool 
in slowing the spread. But today, 
with omicron skyrocketing in 
almost every county across the 
nation, preventing every individ-
ual case is no longer possible or 
practical.

“Omicron, with its extraordi-

nary, unprecedented degree of 
efficiency of transmissibility, will 
ultimately find just about every-
body,” Dr. Anthony Fauci said, 
noting the vaccinated and boosted 
who do get infected will “do rea-
sonably well in the sense of not 
having hospitalization and death.” 
Though lockdowns may reduce 
cases in the short term, they won’t 
stop the virus from spreading over 
the long run. It’s imperative that 
American leaders, from the local 
to the federal level, prioritize pre-
venting severe disease over cases, 
which are almost always mild for 
the vaccinated and even some-
times asymptomatic. 

Already, President Biden has 

turned his focus toward prevent-
ing hospitalization and death, 
reassuring most Americans that 
it’s “very unlikely that you become 
seriously ill.” The Biden admin-
istration recently took action to

hen the Regents of 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan 
decided 

to terminate former University 
President Mark Schlissel, they 
released 118 pages of Schlissel’s 
communications along with their 
announcement. These documents, 
containing emails, text messages 
and images, while important in 
the name of transparency, were 
promptly snapped up by a ravenous 
student body. One reddit comment 
remarked that “Never had this 
many undergraduates been so 
keen to do primary source research 
on a Saturday night.” The emails 
were 
memefied 
immediately, 

with merchandise coming to the 
market within the week, making 
fun of our lonely president m. 
This transparency is refreshing 
and 
Schlissel’s 
indiscretions 

were serious, but one naturally 
wonders, 
especially 
considering 

the predictable student reaction, 
whether this dump of salacious 
documents is anything other than 
an attempt to shield the Board 
of Regents — not necessarily the 
University as an institution — from 
blame and embarrassment.

It was no secret that Schlissel 

was not particularly popular on 
campus; 
discussions 
regarding 

Schlissel were frequently filled 
with frustration or disappointment. 
These grievances have led students 
to often question his decisions. 
However, many of the trademark 
bad decisions made by Schlissel 
were directed, or at least directly 
influenced, by the board. 

Take the unpopular decision to 

prematurely bring students back to 
campus for the fall 2020 semester 
— prior to the development of 
COVID-19 vaccines. This was not 
a unilateral decision by Schlissel 
and his administration but was 
a subject of major frustration for 
students who felt they had no voice 
in this decision. One board member, 
University Regent Ron Weiser 
(R), who has a financial stake in 
off-campus housing, even donated 
$30 million to the University days 
before its announcement to reopen. 
No one can quantify the impact of 
the regents, especially those with 
vested interests, on these decisions 
conclusively, but we must reflect on 
their influence.

While Schlissel’s actions were 

both damaging to the University’s 
reputation and an abuse of the 
power he held over U-M employees, 
numerous faculty accused of sexual 
assault 
and 
harassment 
were 

allowed a far more graceful exit. 

When former American Culture 

lecturer 
Bruce 
Conforth 
was 

reported to University officials 
for attempting to engage in sexual 
relationships with three students 
in 2008, he was allowed to retire 
otherwise unpunished in 2017 — 
inarguably a much more private 
departure than that of Schlissel. 

Former Music, Theatre & Dance 

professor David Daniels was fired 
by the board for allegations of sexual 
misconduct in March of 2020. Not 
only did the board not include a 
similarly large disclosure report, 
they began the process of formally 
firing Daniels over a year earlier, in 
July of 2019, based on allegations 
made public in August of 2018. 
Schlissel was reported, investigated 
and terminated in under two 
months.

In the well-known case of former 

Provost Martin Philbert, the board 
released an 88-page report based 
on an investigation into his sexual 
misconduct. However, releasing 
118 pages of memeable emails 
does not have the same effect that 
releasing a dense WilmerHale 
report does. Hundreds of jokes were 
not inspired by this in-depth report, 
only a fraction of which consists of 
Philbert’s actual communications. 
Secondary sources like this report 
tend to obscure the actual nature 
of the relevant content, as actual 
words inherently convey more 
than descriptions. The Regents’ 
decision to release a mass of 
personal messages deviates from 
its customary form of transparency 
about its activities, which typically 
consists of formal reports like the 
one regarding Philbert. 

In their official release, the board 

said they were releasing Schlissel’s 
communications “In the interest of 
full public disclosure.” Was this kind 
of visibility not necessary in those 
previous cases? Was the speed with 
which the board investigated and 
removed Schlissel not necessary 
before? 

This is not to criticize the Board’s 

decision to be transparent. If the 
board is going to adequately combat 
the ongoing and historic issues of 
sexual assault and harassment in 
the University, as they should, a 
consistent approach is necessary. 
This is to say that releasing 
important documents related to 
similar allegations should be the 
norm — not exclusive to figures 
with a negative public image like 
Schlissel. 

But 
apart 
from 
Schlissel’s 

strained relationship with students 
and faculty, it is worth noting that 
he fell out with the Board of Regents 
in the past year too. In light of the 
severity with which Schlissel’s 
case was treated in comparison to 
other aforementioned cases, it is 
clear that the board chose to use 
Schlissel’s actions as a means to 
(rightfully) remove an adversary 

of theirs. While these emails 
were insightful and undeniably 
humorous, this is a politicization 
of the process of dealing with 
sexual misconduct that will serve 
to taint future investigations with 
the stench of bias. Only a consistent 
protocol will ensure that this does 
not occur.

The board and administration 

must 
release 
a 
comprehensive 

plan of action for any future sexual 
assault 
or 
misconduct 
reports 

against professors, administration 
officials or any employed University 
official. Such a comprehensive plan 
will ensure that every case is treated 
seriously and with consistency 
to ensure that transgressions are 
treated with the seriousness and 
transparency they deserve. A system 
where allegations of misconduct 
are treated on a case-by-case basis 
allows for certain individuals, like 
Conforth, Daniels and Philbert to 
get away with their behavior for 
years. Sexual misconduct can occur 
at any level of the University. Only 
taking strong, public action against 
the most recognizable figures fails 
to address the broader issue. 

While firing Schlissel is a step 

in the right direction, the Board 
of Regent’s choice of an interim 
replacement, 
President 
Emerita 

Mary Sue Coleman, is not untainted 
herself. Coleman was reportedly 
aware of allegations against Martin 
Philbert during her tenure as 
president. Despite the allegations 
and Coleman’s knowledge, Philbert 
was allowed to continue serving as 
Dean of the School of Public Health 
for the rest of Coleman’s term and 
nearly six years afterward.

If Coleman’s appointment was 

meant by the board as a return to 
normalcy, to the “scandal free” 
era before Schlissel, it just shows 
how deeply tolerance of sexual 
misconduct is ingrained in the 
University’s 
administration. 

The flood of sexual assault and 
harassment 
allegations 
against 

faculty and administrators during 
Schlissel’s term was by no means 
unique. The issues of sexual 
misconduct within this university 
have been tied to Mark Schlissel; 
losing him means losing a figurehead 
to rally against and replacing him 
with a less controversial former 
president who people remember 
fondly. Once the jokes about these 
emails die down, we will still be left 
with an administration that turns 
a blind eye to sexual misconduct, 
but this time one that commands 
less scrutiny from the public. This 
cannot become the case. We have 
to remain vigilant about this issue. 
To avoid further negligence and 
complaisance, we must hold the 
board accountable for consistent 
and fair actions when faced with 
such situations.

It’s time to update our COVID-19 game plan

M

isogyny in academia 
is a special breed, 
even in “progressive” 

universities. 
What 
makes 

misogyny in academia unique is the 
unnecessary competition between 
different fields, particularly STEM 
and liberal arts: which is more 
necessary, which is more lucrative, 
which is more ethical and all sorts 
of other superlatives. As a woman 
with a liberal arts major, I not 
only often feel this competition, 
but also experience and witness 
internalized misogyny between 
women in STEM and women 
in 
liberal 
arts. 
The 
debate 

between STEM vs. liberal arts 
inaccurately reflects the true 
value of academics, and worsens 
misogyny by keeping us occupied 
with in-fighting instead of fighting 
patriarchal structures. 

The 
debate 
is 
not 
only 

irrelevant, 
but 
fundamentally 

flawed. 
Although 
containing 

different courses, degrees and 
careers, the two are functionally 
connected; 
one 
cannot 
exist 

without the other. How else would 
we have well-written lab reports 
reflecting 
scientific 
research, 

technologically-advanced 
museums demonstrating history, 
digital art and online books? While 
independently 
important, 
the 

interdisciplinary nature of STEM 
and liberal arts keeps the world 
advancing, tangibly and intangibly, 
factually and emotionally. 

We 
aren’t 
only 
competing 

over our academic beliefs, but 
the existence of misogyny itself 
towards the other party. Misogyny 
in academia is not one-size-fits-
all, but is uniquely based on our 
specific interests. When women 
have already been exposed to 

internalized misogyny our entire 
lives (who’s prettier, smarter, 
wealthier, etc.), academics add 
yet another layer. We’re not 
only driven further apart, but 
it becomes more difficult to 
communicate and respect one 
another in our experiences.

For STEM majors working 

in a “man’s world,” women are 
often 
discriminated 
against 

and not given the same voice or 
opportunities. Despite increasing 
numbers of women as researchers, 
authors and reviewers, they are 
still underrepresented in research 
projects, publications and grant 
rewards. Marginalized women, 
such as women of color and 
transgender women, have even 
more difficulties with gaining 
recognition. The mere presence of 
women in STEM fields has caused 
backlash with scientists trying 
to justify the gap with different 
theories, including that women 
are biologically less fit for STEM 
or biologically less interested than 
men — both of which have been 
proven false.

On 
the 
other 
hand, 

misconceptions 
about 
the 

importance 
of 
liberal 
arts 

programs and their economic 
value have led some universities 
to cut funding for the programs 
altogether. I believe a key part of 
this trend is that liberal arts is 
often seen as “women’s work.” 
Throughout history, when once 
male-dominated fields, such as 
teaching and social work, became 
women-dominated, those fields 
are then seen as less important. As 
a result, liberal arts coursework is 
seen as less difficult and necessary 
in the grand scheme. Women are 
encouraged to change career paths 
or even drop out. Just recently, U.S. 
Rep. Madison Cawthorn, R–N.C., 
encouraged students to drop out 

of college unless they “become a 
doctor or lawyer or engineer.” 

In STEM or liberal arts, when 

the work and achievements of 
women are undervalued on a 
personal and industry level, there 
is no point debating which form of 
misogyny is worse. When we fail 
to recognize different experiences 
with misogyny and its harm, 
we allow it to continue. Though 
passive, we all take responsibility 
when other women suffer. 

Seeing women in STEM make 

new strides and push for equality, 
I have admittedly felt embarrassed 
over my major and even resentful. 
I fear that I’m not doing enough for 
feminism by working in a women-
dominated field. For this, I’ve also 
felt ignored in my experiences 
with misogyny, because it’s not 
seen as being “as bad” as what 
other women in college face. 
Conversely, I’ve been praised for 
choosing a creative field and not 
one that’s “boring” or “typical” as 
some have inaccurately described 
STEM. 

This is why I’m extending 

not an olive branch but rather a 
metaphorical treaty. We cannot 
accept praise for our achievements 
at the expense of other women and 
their goals. My work in liberal arts 
is both influential and lucrative, 
and STEM is becoming more 
common because of our developing 
world. When so many differences 
and ignorances distract us from 
fighting for equality, we shouldn’t 
let this false narrative deter us even 
further from our goals. Is “girls 
support girls” an oversimplified 
motto? Yes, but I don’t think 
“STEM girls support liberal arts 
girls and vice versa” has to be 
so complicated. Changing our 
mentality on academic purpose 
is one step towards eliminating 
academic misogyny.

Hey, women in STEM, let’
s form an alliance

W

hen 
I 
returned 

from break, after 
three 
weeks 
of 

not seeing the people I had 
spent every second with for 
five months, you can imagine 
there was a lot to catch up 
on. Besides updates about life 
back home and the exchange 
of new schedules, there was 
one change that stood out 
amongst the other news: many 
of them had decided to change 
their major. I found it very 
strange to see so many of my 
friends returning to campus 
with a newfound change in 
the direction that they wanted 
to take their lives in. It made 
me start to think about all the 
people I knew and wonder: 
how 
many 
of 
them 
had 

changed their career paths in 
the last few months? Let’s just 
say, those who had stuck with 
their intended major were in 
the minority. 

It has always troubled me 

how today’s society expects us 
to know what we want to do for 
the rest of our lives by such a 
young age. For instance, there 
is no doubt that when applying 
to 
colleges, 
someone 
who 

can show a constant passion 
that they followed through 
for four years becomes a very 

strong 
candidate. 
Speaking 

from 
personal 
experience, 

my desire to find a consistent 
interest led me to choose 
environmental 
science 
as 

my 
life’s 
passion. 
Under 

pressure from my parents, my 
rationale at the time was that 
I liked nature and so by the 
transitive property, I should 
like environmental science. 
And that was that. For the next 
four years, that one choice 
shaped every decision I would 
later make. 

In 
my 
sophomore 
year 

of high school, instead of 
applying to the Manhattan 
District Attorney internship 
like I wanted to, I forced myself 
to spend 10 weeks at the Salt 
Marsh Nature Center building 
bat houses and creating urban 
gardens. Instead of taking the 
senior year elective, “Western 
Political Theory,” that I had 
my eye on since freshman 
year, I signed up for “Urban 
Ecology.” In fear of not being 
able to show one constant 
interest, I gave up the chance 
to pursue the varying interests 
I had and wound up sticking 
with environmentalism for my 
entire high school career. The 
one thing that provided me 
some comfort was college and, 
specifically, the opportunity 
it would provide me to truly 
explore and delve into all my 
interests. And that’s exactly 

what I have been doing.

With high school still fresh 

in my mind, I have been 
intentionally selfish at the 
University. Instead of making 
decisions based on what I 
think I should be doing for 
graduate school or my parents, 
I have been making decisions 
based on what I want and it 
has been incredible. However, 
I have quickly realized that 
not everyone has the same 
mindset. Entering college, I 
was very transparent about 
my lack of direction. Though 
I had some idea of the path I 
wanted to take, things were 
still very up in the air, and 
honestly, they still are. When 
I was meeting dozens of new 
people throughout the first 
few weeks, I was so impressed 
with how confident each of 
them were in their primary 
interests. It made me feel like 
I was doing something wrong. 
But then, after those initial 
weeks passed and I really got 
to know my friends, I realized 
the truth: there are very few 
freshmen who actually know 
what they are doing or what 
they want, but not many who 
can admit it. 

I 
have 
had 
countless 

conversations 
with 
people 

who all have had crises over 
a lack of direction and every 
time all I have wanted to do 
was to scream in their face: it’s 

okay to not know! One of my 
pre-medicine friends switched 
to 
business 
and 
another 

future doctor is considering 
app design layouts; I wish 
everyone could realize that 
there is time to figure out 
what you truly want to do. I 
will concede that the looming 
presence of declaring a major 
and finishing its prerequisite 
courses 
is 
definitely 
a 

legitimate concern. However, 
hearing yet another of my 
friends 
complaining 
about 

her solely pre-med guided 
schedule and the fact that she 
is unable to take other classes 
that interest her makes it 
clear how important it is to 
experiment a bit. 

I know that being undecided 

can feel scary and like you are 
losing some sort of lifetime 
race, but I can assure you 
that is not the case. If in 
the beginning of semester 
icebreakers people revealed 
how they actually felt about 
their future, it would be 
clear 
that 
the 
community 

of undecided or uncertain 
undergraduates is much larger 
than it appears. At the end of 
the day, the stigma around 
being undecided is completely 
unfounded. 
College 
is 

such a unique and special 
opportunity to finally delve 
into all the interests you have. 
Don’t waste it.

T

he day will eventually 
come. It’s not a matter of if 
— but when — the COVID-

19 pandemic will be formally 
declared over. Unfortunately, those 
of us who have continued to take 
the appropriate steps to mitigate 
the virus’ spread are still subject 
to some of the same restrictions 
in place since early 2020. A seven-
day, nationwide average of nearly 
500,000 COVID-19 cases almost 
two years after the start of the 
pandemic is clearly a testament to 
the failures of two administrations. 
However, it is well beyond dispute 
that the Republican Party and 
its supporters do not believe in 
science. It would be generous to say 
that only some of the GOP’s voting 
base wears its abject ignorance as a 
sort of perverse badge of honor.

It is not arguable in good faith 

that all Americans share equal 
blame for our present predicament. 
Young and old, north and south, east 
and west, conservative Republicans 
are the reason the pandemic is still 
raging in the U.S. They are, to quote 
former President Donald Trump, 
why “the world is laughing at us.” 
Indeed, the pandemic is equally a 
matter of politics as it is a matter 
of science. There are numerous 
documented stories of patients, 
thoroughly gaslit and laying on 
their 
deathbeds, 
regurgitating 

the 
same 
baseless 
COVID-19 

conspiracy theories being spread 
by Republican leaders. To put it 
simply, Republican politicians are 
killing their own voters. 

Much of this is settled in (the 

attached-to-reality portion of) 
the public square. To rehash how 
we’ve arrived at such a patently 
preposterous moment in world 
history would be fruitless. The 
only worthwhile course of action 
this late into the pandemic is 
to discuss how best to move 
forward with this virus as an 
inevitable part of life, as has been 
the case with the flu for the last 
century.

It might be jarring to hear that 

sentiment coming from a bleeding-
heart liberal, especially one who 
has 
repeatedly 
lambasted 
the 

American Conservative movement 
over 
COVID-19. 
However, 

Republicans have won their war 
on medicine at least to the extent 
that this virus becoming endemic 
appears a logical, if not foregone, 
conclusion. As such, waiting for 
the virus to be eradicated before 
proceeding with a return to pre-
pandemic life is akin to asking 
Santa for a pet unicorn this year. 

My proposal for Americans to be 

able to live with COVID-19 while 
still living our lives might seem a bit 
draconian at first glance. However, 
I would argue that it is exactly as 
nihilistic and petty as the nonsense 
to which we sane, sentient human 
beings have been subjected to by 
the COVID-19 denial class for 
almost two years. This proposal, 
though, makes scientific — and 
cathartic — sense, especially in a 
city such as Ann Arbor, of which 
young people are its lifeblood. We, 
as University of Michigan students, 
are the engine which drives our 
city and our institution. We are 
also required by our school to be 
fully vaccinated and to receive a 
booster dose, which is known to 
substantially reduce the risk of 
severe illness. Why, then, should we 
bear responsibility for the public 
health risks being taken by the 37% 
of Washtenaw County residents 
who remain unvaccinated? It is 
with that in mind that the city of 
Ann Arbor should take steps that 
will both encourage those holdouts 
to get vaccinated while removing 
the burden of their stupidity from 
those who have followed the advice 
of public health professionals.

As it stands now, University 

students are expected to wear 
masks, limit the size of social 
gatherings, 
limit 
travel 
and 

quarantine for an extended time 
with a positive COVID-19 test. That 
all sounded great in 2020, but now, 
the student body is vaccinated, and 
likely to show only minor symptoms 
for only a short number of days, if 
we were to show any symptoms 
at all. All of that is to say that U-M 
students face a low risk if they 
contract COVID-19, but we are still 
behaving as if it is the monumental, 
universal public health threat it was 
nearly two years ago. 

U-M students, who have suffered 

the loss of much of our college 
experience for it, must no longer be 
responsible for the choices of the 
unvaccinated. Provided that it can 
be done so legally – and given the 
emergency powers of the executive 
at the state and federal levels, that 
shouldn’t be a problem – hospitals 
nationwide must begin a triage 
process for access to COVID care. 
Hospitals nationwide are facing 
capacity and equipment shortages 
nearly two full years into the 
pandemic, and almost a year after 
vaccines became available. At this 
point, some burden of responsibility 
must be on the individual who has 
refused to be vaccinated. 

Given that there are finite 

resources to be dedicated to 
COVID patients, there must be 
some form of hierarchy in place to 
ensure that those who continue to 
place the whole of society at risk 
are accounted for only after life-
saving treatment has been directed 
to all vaccinated patients in need 
of care. As hospitals are plagued 
by the unrelenting stupidity of the 
Republican–led anti-vax crusade, it 
is only fair to exercise discretion in 
the distribution of care. None of this 
is to say the unvaccinated should 
be 
altogether 
denied 
medical 

care. 
However, 
by 
permitting 

doctors and hospitals to exercise 
discretion as to who receives 
prioritized COVID-19-related care, 
federal, state and local authorities 
(depending on the level at which 
such a policy is instituted) would be 
rewarding two of the demographics 
most adversely affected by COVID-
19: youth and medical professionals. 
Doing so is both a logical and moral 
imperative. 

Such a policy would also not 

fall outside the scope of standard 
medical practices, even before the 
pandemic. It is a longstanding, and 
eminently sensible, procedure in 
the medical community to triage 
patients based on chances of 
survival when faced with limited 
space, resources, equipment or 
personnel; those with a higher 
chance of survival are prioritized, 
so as to most efficiently and 
effectively allocate finite materials. 
Suffice to say, the COVID situation 
has placed all of those limitations 
on hospitals across the country. It 
doesn’t take an epidemiologist to 
know that the patients most likely to 
survive hospitalization are the ones 
who are vaccinated. Therefore, in 
addition to the moral imperative of 
prioritizing those who have taken 
steps to protect those around them, 
a triage system would also make for 
the best solution to the constraints 
faced by hospitals nationwide. 
While it is true that this will likely 
never come to pass, it is well past 
time for young Americans — all 
vaccinated 
Americans, 
really 

— to ask that the burden of the 
pandemic be placed on those too 
self-righteous to help end it. The 
sane 63% must not suffer for the 
ignorance of the insufferable 37%.

We, as college students, have lost 

so much since March 2020. It’s not 
just the tangible losses of COVID-
19 deaths that have cost people 
our age recently. Adolescents and 
young adults have been deprived of 
opportunities and life experiences, 
which, uniquely to us, we will 
never be able to get back. Whether 
it was the inability to study abroad, 
to celebrate or congregate in large 
groups or simply to interact with 
our professors and peers in person 
or unmasked, none of these things 
are replaceable in later life. College 
students continue to be deprived 
of 
their 
once-in-a-lifetime 

college experience because of 
older people who believe their 
“personal freedoms” trump — 
pun intended — the public good. 
Adults who lost their jobs are now 
faced with the best job market in a 
generation. Those who had to work 
remotely were able to experience 
a traditional work environment 
before — and will be able to 
again at some point. Experiences 
associated 
with 
youth 
and 

adolescence are nearly impossible 
to replicate, while more “adult” 
milestones can still be achieved 
later on. It is time for young people 
to take some agency in our lives, 
and stop allowing the older, and 
dumber, among us to dictate which 
formative experiences we deserve 
to enjoy. We won’t get these years 
back.

SportsWednesday: In Bloomington 
road win, Wolverines look like the 

team they could have been

Penn State dominates Michigan, 29-6, as Michigan 

drops many tight bouts

Holman, Women’s track team lead the day at Michigan Invitational

As redshirt-sophomore Cole 

Mattin walked onto the mat, it 
still seemed like the No. 3 Michi-
gan wrestling team had a chance 
to keep its dual meet against No.1 
Penn State within striking dis-
tance. 

After three bouts, the Nittany 

Lions were leading by five, and 
Mattin was preparing to wrestle 
a winnable match — certainly one 
that he needed to win.

Instead, he wrestled for just 15 

seconds. 

As Mattin collapsed, clutch-

ing his ankle, everyone wear-
ing maize and blue at Crisler 
Center let out a sigh of despair. 
Not just because Penn State was 
now ahead by eleven points, but 
because everything that pos-
sibly could go wrong for Michi-
gan was going wrong. After six 
matches, just one of which the 
Wolverines won, the fans’ wor-
ries were confirmed, and Michi-
gan (5-1 overall, 1-1 Big Ten) left 
the Crisler Center dominated 
by the Nittany Lions (13-0, 5-0), 
29-6, in their biggest dual meet 

of the season. 

Throughout the entire night, 

Michigan looked overwhelmed 
as inability to score takedowns, 
injuries and crushingly tight loss 
after loss doomed the Wolver-
ines. 

The night started with No. 1 

graduate student Nick Suriano 
winning his toughest match of 
the season over Penn State’s No. 
7 Drew Hildebrandt. But present 
even in Suriano’s victory was a ten-
dency that would plague the team 
for the rest of the night, as Suriano 
won the match, 2-1, without scor-
ing a takedown. 

“The area that was real glar-

ing tonight was just basic hand-
fighting,” Michigan coach Sean 
Bormet said. “We didn’t fight 
hard enough to get to the ties we 
needed to be in and we weren’t 
constantly clearing their ties. It’s 
an area we got exposed tonight 
and it slowed down our offense.”

After 
Suriano, 
the 
wheels 

began to come off.

Redshirt 
freshman 
Dylan 

Ragusin was the first to fall, 8-1, 
narrowly 
avoiding 
surrender-

ing a major-decision victory to 
Penn State’s No. 1 ranked Roman 
Bravo-Young as the clock ran 

out. Following Ragusin at 141 lbs, 
graduate student Drew Mattin 
filled in for recently-scratched 
graduate student Stevan Micic 
to face the Nittany Lions’ No. 1 
ranked Nick Lee. Mattin was out-
paced and surrendered a techni-
cal fall late in the third period, 
losing 21-6. 

As Cole Mattin hobbled off of 

the mat 15 seconds into his match, 
the Wolverines were behind, 14-3, 

and had yet to score a takedown. 

Redshirt junior Will Lewan 

changed that at 157 lbs in a victory 
over Penn State’s Terrell Barra-
clough in which he was able to 
outmuscle his opponent to score 
two single leg takedowns and win 
the bout 5-2, making the match 
14-6.

Up until that matchup, even 

though the Wolverines suffered 
tough losses, it felt as if each 

match had a clear aggressor. Each 
result could have been expected 
coming into the night. 

But at 165 lbs, the tide turned.
From 165 all the way to heavy-

weight, each match was nearly 
identical. The wrestlers took 
the mat, wrestled three peri-
ods of incredibly tight, mostly 
scoreless action, surrendered a 
late takedown, and lost by one 
or two points. In every match, 
it felt like the Wolverines were 
just about to break through, but 
never did.

At 174 lbs, graduate student 

Logan Massa had the Nittany 
Lions’ Brady Berge lifted in the 
air but couldn’t finish. At 184 lbs 
graduate student Myles Amine 
lost a scramble in overtime. And 
at heavyweight Mason Parris led 
into the third period, but gave up a 
late takedown and got ridden out. 

But the match most indicative 

of the team’s woes was at 197 lbs, 
where Pat Brucki lost to Penn 
State’s No. 2 ranked Max Dean in 
overtime. Brucki scored two take-
downs and surrendered none in 
regulation, but still couldn’t close 
out the match. He entered the 
third period ahead, and only had 
to escape to earn a victory, but 

instead got ridden out. 

“We gotta clean up the bottom 

wrestling,” Bormet said. “Espe-
cially when we’re getting to our 
feet and are in position to hit cut-
outs, we discussed and worked 
that area several times, but it has 
gotta work here.”

Each bout filled the arena with 

hope — even after the team result 
was decided — that the individual 
wrestlers could earn themselves a 
major victory over top ranked oppo-
nents. But Penn State never faltered.

Overall the Nittany Lions out-

wrestled Michigan. Their hand 
fighting was stronger, their shot 
defense was better and their fin-
ishes were cleaner. Their wres-
tlers consistently found ways to 
get their hands raised in matches 
that felt like fifty-fifty tossups. 
Of the five matches the Wolver-
ines lost to end the night, none 
was decided by more than three 
points.

“There’s just some basic basic 

skill level, fundamental wres-
tling, that we’ve got to clean up,” 
Bormet said. “I think tonight put 
the magnifying glass on a few 
of those areas, the handfights, 
cleaning up the bottom, and hand 
control.

BLOOMINGTON — It’s how 

it was supposed to happen, 
right?

A raucous sea of red erupt-

ing after a made bucket, a 
crowd waiting for someone — 
anyone — to make a mistake, or 
to at least miss a shot, and let 
its beloved Hoosiers back into 
the game.

The crowd never got that 

moment. Instead, it got crowd-
silencing threes from Caleb 
Houstan.

In a game that Michigan 

needed to win, the talented 
freshman stepped up time and 
time again, just as he did in 
Tuesday’s win over Maryland, 
to help lead his team to its best 
victory of the season.

When Houstan was asked 

postgame to break down his 
recent shooting form, he didn’t 
need to say much:

“I mean, it always feels good 

to make shots,” Houstan said. 
“I think I’m in a really good 
place right now.”

He hasn’t always had that 

feeling, though. Yet, he still 
remained in the gym, putting 
shots up, holding firmly onto 
his confidence.

“He hasn’t changed,” asso-

ciate head coach Phil Martelli 
said on Jan. 17, a day before 
Houstan 
first 
snapped 
his 

major shooting slump. “He’s 
still a young guy that… gets a 
lot of shots up. He works on his 
game.”

But it was always going to 

take more than just working on 
his game during a cold streak. 
More than practice shots.

Eventually 
Houstan 
was 

going to have to play like he 
did Sunday, when the home 
crowd had to hold its breath 
every time he had the ball in 
his hands. When that happens, 
the Wolverines are a different 
team.

A more dangerous team.
The Hoosiers felt that first-

hand today to the tune of 19 
points on 5-of-7 shooting from 
beyond the arc for Houstan. He 
was a killer. He played like the 
five-star prospect he came in 
as, like Michigan’s best recruit 
of the millennia.

Houstan is one of the rea-

sons that the Wolverines came 
in with sky-high expectations 
and why they cratered. When 
he struggled, so too did Michi-
gan. But, now that he’s playing 
like this, momentum is start-
ing to gather.

“I just admire being around 

a guy like Caleb,” Michigan 
coach Juwan Howard said. “I 
see so much growth in him, 
game after game.” 

While Houstan wasn’t quite 

ready for the burden that was 
laid upon him at first — a start-
ing role on an expected nation-
al 
championship 
contender, 

coming in fresh with tremen-
dous expectations of filling 
a gaping perimeter void — he 

has grown into it. Lately, the 
19-year-old sharpshooter is no 
longer passing up driving lanes 
or bricking wide-open threes, 
and while there is still the 
occasional missed shot, those 
are now diluted by confident 
swishes.

There’s no way of knowing if 

this run will sustain itself. But, 
if it does, there is also no tell-
ing what the Wolverines’ ceil-
ing will look like. A team that 
has a dominant paint presence 
paired with outside shooters 
that will drain shots? Tough to 
match up with.

That’s what Houstan was 

always supposed to be for 
Michigan. A wing that pro-
vides 
a 
consistent 
outside 

threat, 
someone 
who 
the 

opposing team always has to 
chase around because if they 
give him an open look, forget 
about it.

So, when the game was 

already well past decided and 
Houstan caught another pass 
on the wing, what happened 
next should come as no sur-
prise.

His fifth and final three, a 

cherry on top of his best game 
of the season in the Wolver-
ines’ best win of the season. 
The statement made was a loud 
one, and while that was lost on 
most of the fans who had either 
left or were making their way 
toward the exits, it wasn’t lost 
on Howard:

“He’s 
always 
been 
rock 

solid, every time, all the time,” 
Howard said. “To come in and 
practice, getting his work in, 
watching film, learning the 
game and staying dialed in 
mentally.

“It’s beautiful.”

TESS CROWLEY/Daily 

The Michigan track and field team competed in its third meet of the season, 

with the women taking home multiple titles.

This isn’t the season the Michi-

gan men’s basketball team was 
supposed to have. 

Before the start of the year, The 

Daily’s beat predicted the Wolver-
ines would finish second in the 
Big Ten and end the year with a 
Big Ten Tournament win and exit 
the NCAA Tournament 
by the Elite Eight at the 
earliest, seeing Michi-
gan reach as far as the 
National Championship 
game. 

And 
they 
weren’t 

alone. 
After 
clinching 

last year’s regular season 
Big Ten title and bringing 
in the nation’s second-
ranked recruiting class, 
there was no reason to 
think 
Michigan’s 
momentum 

wouldn’t carry over. Between the 
return of sophomore center Hunt-
er Dickinson and the additions of 
two five-star freshmen in wing 
Caleb Houstan and big man Mous-
sa Diabate, it was widely accepted 
that Michigan was among the best 
in the Big Ten.

But the team that took the 

floor for the first game — and 
almost every one since — hasn’t 
looked like one that could make 
it to March, let alone April. The 
roster that, on paper, should 
be one of best in the nation has 
failed to come alive. Houstan, 
thrust into the starting lineup 
from the first game, struggled to 
live up to the hype. The defense 
faltered. Overall, the Wolverines 
failed to live up to their lofty 
expectations. 

But, facing Indiana on the road, 

Michigan came away with an 
80-62 win, by far it’s most impres-
sive of the season. 

When asked whether the team 

is playing up to its potential or if 
there’s room left to grow, Michi-
gan coach Juwan Howard cited 
effort as the most important fac-
tor. 

“I’m just proud of how hard 

the team competed today,” How-
ard said. “… We’ll continue to go 

back in the gym each 
and every practice and 
see how we can grow. It 
was beautiful to see all 
the contribution com-
ing from everyone that 
touched that ball.” 

The Wolverines final-

ly exhibited the skilled 
roster that’s been touted 
all year with Dickinson, 
Diabate and Houstan all 
scoring in double digits.

“This team has a chance to get 

better and better each and every 
game,” Howard said. “And with 
how the roster is designed with a 
mixture of juniors and seniors and 
sophomores. … They’re getting 
better and better every game.”

Michigan started the game 

5-for-6 from beyond the arc. The 
Wolverines have hardly been 
known for their 3-point shoot-
ing this season, 
going a total of 
12-for-45 across 
their three most 
recent 
games. 

But, on Sunday, 
Michigan 
got 

hot, shooting a 
total of 11-for-17. 

The 
Wol-

verines 
fell 

into a rhythm 
on all parts of 
the court, the 
defense 
boxing 

out the Hoosiers 
and allowing for 

frequent Michigan runs. They dis-
played the type of energy expected 
of the conference leader the Wol-
verines were supposed to be. 

“Defense is really getting the 

job done for us,” Howard said. 
“Defense sometimes creates the 
offense. It’s great when you see 
the ball go through the net, it defi-
nitely builds confidence in play-
ers.” 

Added Dickinson: “I think guys 

are just playing to their abilities. 
The hard work in the gym is finally 
paying off. I’m really proud of my 
team out there.”

More than just playing to their 

abilities, they’re filling the holes 
— both offensive and defensive 
— that emerged from the Wolver-
ines’ blind spots early in the sea-
son.

So what do you get when you 

add strong defense to long-range 
shooting and contributions from 
up and down the roster? A well-
rounded team that could have a 
shot at a post-season run, the team 
that the Wolverines were sup-
posed to be.

The question then becomes, is 

this a fluke or is it the new normal?

Coming off a victory in its first 

scored meet of the season, the 
Michigan track and field team 
returned to their home track 
for a third-straight weekend, 
hosting a field of 16 colleges and 
dozens of unattached individual 
athletes for the Michigan Invita-
tional. 

Though the event was not 

scored team-wise, the individu-
al competition was fierce, with 
everything from meet records 
to international benchmarks 
being set at Saturday’s meet. 
Ultimately it was the women’s 
track team that had its mem-
bers shine brightest for the 
Wolverines, winning five of its 

nine events.

“Our women’s program in gen-

eral is pretty darn strong right 
now,” Michigan coach Kevin Sul-
livan said. “We can compete with 
anyone in the conference. Poten-
tial can be a dangerous word, but 
they have lots of it.”

Michigan got off to an explosive 

start in the meet, as sophomore 
Aasia Laurencin and freshman 
BreeAna Bates posted convincing 
victories in the women’s 60-meter 
dash and women’s 60-meter hur-
dles respectively. 

It was sophomore Ziyah Hol-

man’s performance in the wom-
en’s 600-meters that generated 
the most buzz among the crowd, 
however, as Holman and fresh-
man Savannah Sutherland dueled 
it out entering the final turn. With 
a final push, Holman both won 

the event, and posted a facility 
record in the event with a 1:29.26 
time — just one one-hundredth of 
a second faster than the previous 
record.

“I’m glad I could do the least 

and win my race, getting the 
record is an extra thing,” Holman 
said. “I always feel more comfort-
able on this track, and it helps me 
get in the right mindset for travel 
meets.”

On the men’s side, the Wol-

verines’ two victories of the day 
came in the 600 and 800-meter 
dashes. In the 800-meter, senior 
Derrick Simmons finished half a 
second faster than the next best 
runner, while in the 600-meter 
sophomore Dubem Amene posted 
a meet record time on the route to 
victory.

Dubem wasn’t the only Amene 

to win on the day however — his 
sister, senior Chika Amene, post-
ed a victory in the women’s 400-
meter dash.

“My sister brought me into 

track,” Dubem said. “She doesn’t 
understand how much she moti-
vates me. She started it for both of 
us, and I want to get to her level 
before I’m done.”

With the end of the Michi-

gan Invitational, the team now 
enters a significant road stretch, 
with just one of their remaining 
six regular season meets being 
hosted in Ann Arbor. Sullivan, 
however, is focused on a different 
perspective.

“We have quite a few athletes, 

particularly on the men’s side, 
that will be returning after this 
weekend, so we’re excited to get 
some depth.”

B

LOOMINGTON — Capitalizing on 
momentum has been a difficult task 
for the Michigan men’s basketball 
team all season. 

On the heels of a blowout win 

against Maryland, the Wolverines looked to finally 
build some by going on the road and defeating an 
upstart Hwoosiers team to grab their first quadrant 
one win. 

Michigan (9-7 overall, 3-3 Big Ten) did just that, 

defeating Indiana (14-5, 5-4), 80-62, on Sunday 
afternoon. Showing a gusto on both ends of the floor 
that it had lacked most of the year, the Wolverines got 
off to a hot start in both halves to fuel the victory. 

“We were trying to build momentum because 

we needed it, especially coming into this stretch,” 
sophomore center Hunter Dickinson said. “We knew 
that the stretch coming up was very important for us. We 
were playing for our season.”

Michigan came out playing like its life was on the line 

and blitzed Indiana in the early going thanks to a barrage 
of 3-pointers. 

A shot that has been a point of weakness for the 

Wolverines most of the season suddenly became its 
biggest weapon. Indiana collapsed towards the paint to try 
and stop interior looks, leaving shooters wide open on the 
perimeter. Michigan started the game 5-of-6 from deep, 
including two from freshman forward Caleb Houstan, who 
had made three from deep against the Terrapins after just 
two in his previous five games. The offense was getting 
every look it wanted and raced out to a 29-13 lead. 

“I think guys are just finally hitting shots that weren’t 

going in the beginning of the season,” Dickinson said. “I 
think (those were) shots that we were hitting last year that 
led to our success and it’s carrying over now to wins for us 
this year.”

Indiana, on the other hand, had been especially 

lackluster from the 3-point line, shooting just 
34.3% on the year — and the Wolverines looked 
to take advantage. They often flashed 
a zone, but the Hoosiers could not 
take advantage of the open looks. 
Indiana went just 1-of-8 on 
3-pointers in the half.

JOSH TAUBMAN
Daily Sports Editor

Late in the half, though, the Hooisers began to show 

some signs of life. They were persistent with their drives 
to the basket and back-to-back and-one makes from 
forward Trayce Jackson-Davis fueled a 9-0 run to cut 
into Michigan’s lead. 

When the halftime buzzer sounded, the Wolverines 

led just 38-30. While the hot start had seemingly faded 
for most of the team, the saving grace for Michigan 
— surprisingly — was sophomore forward Terrance 
Williams II. Williams had shot just 3-of-12 over his last 
five games but went a perfect 4-for-4 from the field for 
10 points and prevented Indiana from doing further 
damage. 
“I just wanted to provide something off the bench 
along with my energy and effort,” Williams said. 
“Today that just so happened to be scoring.” In 
the second half, the rest of the Wolverines’ lineup 
rediscovered its early mojo. Just under 90 seconds 
in, fifth year guard DeVante’ Jones laid in a bucket 
for the and-one off the fast break. Houstan splashed 
a three the next possession and the lead ballooned 
back up to 14.
“It’s great when you see the ball go through the net,” 
Michigan coach Juwan Howard said. “It definitely 
builds confidence for the players and it also helps on the 
road and the ball goes to the net because it takes some of 
the energy out of the crowd.”
 After a sporadic stretch over the next several minutes 
that saw both teams go cold from the field, Houstan was 
once again there to bail the Wolverines out. He drained a 
three from the left corner to make it a 58-45 ballgame with 
just under 11 minutes to play. 
 Houstan shot the ball with the confidence that had made 
him a highly touted shooter coming into the year, finishing 
with 19 points and going 5-for-7 from beyond the arc. The 
team as a whole fed off this energy, shooting 11-for-17 from 
deep. 
 Every time Indiana made a basket to give the crowd life, 
Michigan responded to sit them back down. As time trickled 
down, the Wolverines nursed a double digit lead that had 
grown to 16 with six minutes to go. Dickinson led the way, 
making threes and drawing and-ones that garnered celebra-
tions with continually growing enthusiasm. 
 “I think we had a few runs in the game,” Jackson-Davis said. 
“But every time we got close, they would pull away.”
 With 1:15 to go, Houstan drained an elbow three, putting an 
emphatic exclamation point on a resounding road victory for 
Michigan that it dominated from the start.
 “They’re getting better and better each and every game,” 
Howard said. “I just see that from what we have from the 
disposition at practice, I’m not surprised that our team played 
well today.”
