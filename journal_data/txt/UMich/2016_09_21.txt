The University of Michigan’s 

Spectrum Center and the Office 
of Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs 
hosted their second collaborative 
open house Tuesday to spread 
awareness about their activities 
and services for new students on 
campus.

Program 
organizers 
Abby 

Chien, 
MESA 
program 

manager, 
and 
Mark 
Chung 

Kwan Fan, assistant director 
for the Spectrum Center, said 
they’ve started to realize more 
of the intersections of the two 
programs’ missions, with joint 
events serving as one expression 
of that.

The Spectrum Center, founded 

in 1971, is an organization within 
Student Life that focuses on 
building community among the 
University’s LGBTQ students, 
offering support services like 
peer 
mentorship, 
educational 

workshops and free HIV testing. 
MESA also aims to create an 
inclusive 
space 
on 
campus, 

focusing on issues of race and 
ethnicity and offering services 
such as peer mentorship and 

The city discovered Monday 

that a sewer overflow allowed 
an estimated 600,000 gallons of 
sewage to spill into the Huron 
River this weekend.

The overflow was traced 

back to a construction site on 
Geddes Avenue near Gallup 
Park. According to a press 
release, debris from the site led 
to a blockage in a sanitary sewer, 
which then caused the overflow. 
The 
overflow 
is 
estimated 

to have occurred sometime 
between 3 p.m. on Saturday 
and 7 a.m Monday, when it was 

discovered.

The blockage was removed 

immediately after its discovery, 
allowing the normal flow of 
sewage to return. However, 
some amount of sewage had 
already reached the river.

Geddes 
Pond 
stillwater 

paddles and Argo-Gallup canoe 
trips have been temporarily 
suspended 
by 
Gallup 
Park 

authorities 
until 
the 
water 

can be tested. The city has 
already informed the Michigan 
Department of Environmental 
Quality 
about 
the 
incident, 

according to the release.

There are no communities

University 
of 
Michigan 

faculty 
members 
convened 

Tuesday night at the School of 
Social Work to contextualize 
and discuss the implications 
of 
the 
United 
Kingdom’s 

recent referendum to leave the 
European Union.

The referendum, commonly 

referred to as “Brexit,” took 
place on June 23, 2016, with 
51.9 percent of Britain’s citizens 
voting to leave the EU and 48.1 
percent voting to remain.

The panel was moderated 

by Sociology Prof. Genevieve 
Zubrzycki and comprised of 
Law Prof. Daniel Halberstam, 
History 
Prof. 
Kali 
Israel, 

Political Science Prof. Pauline 
Jones Luong and History Prof. 
Joshua Cole, who discussed the 
causes and consequences of the 
referendum.

Zubrzycki opened the panel 

by noting how the vote surprised 
voters in the UK and the United 
States as well as stakeholders 
internationally, citing reporting 
from The New York Times 
that said polls predicted the 
referendum had an 88-percent 
chance of failing.

“We woke up the following 

morning on this side of the 
Atlantic surprised, shocked and 
with a great dose of disbelief,” 
Zubrzycki said

Putting the Brexit vote in 

historical context, Israel said 
nostalgic visions and ideas of 

a “British Empire” had some 
effect in swaying the vote. 
In particular, he said some 
proponents of Brexit invoked 
ideas of British imperialism and 
nationalism in their to influence 
citizens to cast their votes 
away from the EU. He cited a 
series of controversial bus ads 
run by the “leave” campaign in 
the UK, which contained false 
information about the amount 
of money the UK was required 

to pay to the EU each week.

“The 
historical 
amnesia 

about empire as well as the 
historical nostalgia for empire 
are a very important context, 
for which I think needs much 
more exploration than they got, 
during the debates leading up 
to the referendum itself,” Israel 
said.

Halberstam, 
participating 

in the panel via webcam from 
Germany, also emphasized the 

causes and legal implications of 
the vote to leave the EU.

“You could sort of describe 

it as the populist awakening 
meets the European democratic 
deficit,” Halberstam said.

Describing the EU as an 

“imbalanced 
federation,” 

Halberstam added that there 
is a power vacuum in Europe 
because member states have 
limited 
their 
own 
national

LSA Dean Andrew Martin speaks to students at a Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Forum at the MLB Tuesday.

After 
a 
year 
of 
planning, 

University 
of 
Michigan 

administrators are beginning to 
release and implement details in 
LSA’s Diversity, Equity & Inclusion 

Strategic Plan.

At the first LSA planning forum 

about the plan Tuesday, with about 
40 students, faculty and staff were 
in attendance, Associate Dean 
Angela Dillard, highlighted the 
“Goals for Access” and the “Goals 
for 
Undergraduate 
Education” 

sections of the plan. These sections 

focus 
on 
improving 
aspects 

of 
undergraduate 
student 
life, 

including maintaining diversity in 
learning communities, improving 
on-time 
graduation 
rates 
and 

making study abroad opportunities 
more publicized so that all students 
are able to reach their full potential.

The full strategic plan will not be 

released until Oct. 6.

The plan, initiated in September 

2015 by University President Mark 
Schlissel, aims to create a campus 
environment where every member 
of the University community feel 
welcome and had equal access to 
the resources and opportunities

around the significant problem 
that certain childhood cancers 
have 
in 
causing 
death 
in 

children.”

According to the National 

Cancer Institute, cancer is the 
leading cause of death past 
infancy among U.S. children. 
An estimated 10,380 new cases 
of childhood cancer will be 
diagnosed in 2016 and about 
1,250 children ages 0 to 14 are 
expected to die from childhood 
cancer in the same period.

Opipari also said there is 

a need for more funding in 
pediatric cancer research and 
treatment.

“The second thing we wanted 

people to understand is how little 
funding goes to the study and 
research in childhood cancers,” 
Opipari said. 

A majority of cancers are 

typically 
associated 
with 

advancing age. However, Steven 
Pipe, a pediatric hematologist 
and oncologist at Mott, said some 
of the most exciting advances in 
cancer research are occurring 
in the pediatric realm. Both the 
University and Wisconsin, which 
are ranked second and fourth, 
respectively, for total research 
and development expenditures 
in 2014 by the National Science 
Foundation, are at the leading 
edge 
of 
this 
fight 
against 

childhood cancer, he added.

“I’ve been working (at Mott) 

for almost 25 years and I can see 
us for the first time really making 
major headway with some of the 
more difficult to treat pediatric 
malignancies,” Pipe said.

He 
highlighted 
two 

breakthroughs 
in 
particular 

being pioneered at Mott: precision 
oncology and immunotherapy. 
In precision oncology, doctors 
comb through a patient’s DNA 

to identify mutations in their 
tumor, which can then be 
matched to specific therapies. 
The immunotherapy approach, 
on the other hand, leverages the 
patient’s own immune system. 
Both of these methods are part 
of a larger movement away from 
nonspecific treatments, such as 
chemotherapy and radiation, to 
methods tailored to the patient’s 
own unique cancer.

A team of Mott researchers 

led by Rajen Mody, professor 
of 
pediatric 
oncology 
and 

hematology at the University, 
published a paper in late 2015 
showing the results from the 
first 102 patients enrolled in a 
precision oncology study at the 
hospital. In 46 percent of the 
patients, 
genetic 
sequencing 

revealed 
new 
targets 
for 

therapies and several children 
were believed to have been cured 
of their cancers, according to 
Opipari.

“We now have a clinic at 
Michigan, 
a 
personalized 

pediatric cancer clinic, where 
patients are coming from all 
over the country to participate 
in 
our 
sequencing 
trial,” 

Opipari said.

The University has had a 

long history of participating 
in cross-campus partnerships 
to advance various health 
initiatives. The annual Ohio 
State-Michigan Blood Battle, 
for example, began in 1982, 
with last year’s battle bringing 
in a total of 4,770 blood 
donations. In 2003, students 
began another tradition, the 
Face-Off 
Blood 
Challenge, 

with in-state rival Michigan 
State University.

Opipari saidif this year 

goes well, the hospital would 
like to explore expanding the 
competition.

“The big goal is that if this 

works, what we’d like to do is 
to make this a Big Ten wide 
challenge,” 
Opipari 
said. 

“We’d like every one of the Big 
Ten teams to get onboard as 
Michigan and Wisconsin have 
started the charge.”

use the Huron River as a source 
of drinking water.

Robert Kellar, communications 

specialist for the city of Ann 
Arbor, said the spill was relatively 
minor but the city cannot release 
more information to the public 
until it has submitted its report 
of the incident to City Council. 
Kellar said the report would 
likely be turned in Wednesday 

morning.

“The 
overflow 
was 
quite 

small, so there is not a significant 
impact,” he said. “But we are still 
taking tests out there.”

This is the third overflow 

incident to occur this year, with 
previous incidents at Bird Hills 
Nature Area, where an estimated 
36,000 gallons spilt over the 
course of 60 hours, and at Malletts 
Creek, where 400,000 of sewage 
overflow was generated across a 
two-week span.

At 
the 
City 
Council 

meeting Monday night, City 
Administrator Howard Lazarus 
said the city will be putting forth 
greater effort going forward to 
prevent such incidents.

“It is always our intent to 

be protective of our natural 
environment,” he said. “When 
something like this occurs, we 
all feel that we have let the public 
down in protecting our natural 
resources, and we will be ever 
more diligent in making sure 
that, to the best of our abilities, it 
does not occur again.”

student organization advising.

“Both our offices focus on 

social identity as a core part of 
who we are and how we interact 
with students, so we decided that 
we wanted to partner together,” 
Chien said. “People often will visit 
both of our spaces in their journeys 
around learning about how they 
want to be involved on campus and 
who they are.”

Chung Kwan Fan agreed, saying 

that working together has been 
beneficial for both organizations.

“I think that we really want 

to address more the piece of 
intersectionality, 
of 
addressing 

different identities and multiple 
complexities of those identities as 
well, so we do already have great 
collaborations between the two 
offices so we decided to thrive 

upon that,” he said. “So it’s not 
just for LGBT students of color, 
but it’s trying to address different 
identities at the same time as well.”

He said the point of the open 

house was to usher in new students 
and offer them support through 
what can be a difficult transition, 
especially for LGBTQ and minority 
students.

“Really to be aware of the 

resources 
that 
MESA 
and 
Spectrum 

offer, 
especially 
the 
support 

services, knowing that being part 
of the LGBTQ community brings 
all our challenges to somebody’s 
transition to the University, so 
knowing that those resources exist 
for them to be able to get to know 
more of their own identity, but also 
how to navigate the system, of U of 
M being such a large university,” 
Chung Kwan Fu said. “Knowing 
their resources about how to 
explore themselves, but also how 
to interact and connect with 

others.”

MESA 
Director 
Trelawny 

Boynton stressed that despite the 
amount of racial progress made 
in the last several decades, MESA 
still has a necessary role at the 
University, especially for incoming 
students.

She noted that the organization 

is in the process of creating their 
own strategic plan, paralleling a 
University of Michigan-wide effort 
launched last year by University 
President Mark Schlissel to create 
a Diversity, Equity & Inclusion 
plan for campus.

“We were created almost 50 

years ago, and we want to make 
sure we’re answering relevant 
questions for why we still need 
to be here, why do we still need 
to do the work that we do and to 
what end,” she said. “And we think 
there’s a compelling reason, we just 
want to prove it to folks who still 
need to know and be reminded.”

MESA

that LSA offers. Units within the 
University were each tasked with 
individually 
developing 
plans, 

which have now been combined 
into one campus-wide plan.

According 
to 
Dillard, 

parts of the plan have already 
been implemented. She cited 
administrators 
working 
to 

incorporate diversity criteria to 
justify faculty pay raises as one 
an example. She also said the LSA 
Opportunity Hub has established 
a laptop loan program, which has 
already loaned out 425 laptops 
to students from family incomes 
of less than $50,000, of which 40 
percent 
are 
underrepresented 

minorities. 

During Tuesday’s forum, LSA 

Dean Andrew Martin spoke of the 
importance of implementing the 
DEI plan because of how a strong 
emphasis on diversity strengthens 
the community.

“Now perhaps more than ever, 

we need to embrace that diversity 
makes us stronger and better,” 
he said. “ ‘Diversity, equity and 
inclusion’ must be more than a 
slogan.”

Martin highlighted a part of 

the called “Goal for Inclusive 
Classrooms,” 
which 
involves 

overhauling 
LSA’s 
Race 
and 

Ethnicity requirement by creating 
smaller sections with more of an 
emphasis on clear discussions and 
dialogues. Currently, LSA students 
must take one class designed as 
R&E before graduation, though 
the 
requirement 
has 
faced 

criticism from students over broad 
criteria for that designation. The 
College of LSA initiated a review 
of the requirement earlier this 
year.

Martin also emphasized that 

the implementation of the DEI 

plan will be effective only with 
the efforts of every member of the 
University.

“This 
will 
require 
real 

mechanisms for creating a campus 
environment where all students, 
faculty and staff feel valued and 
where everyone is able to take 
full advantage of the resources 
and opportunities that make LSA 
the premier public liberal arts 
institution,” he said.

Dillard 
also 
noted 
the 

importance of unity, saying a 
part of the plan responsible for 
connecting to various departments 
could use more detail.

“I think it’s a big hole in the 

plan right now,” she said. “It will 
take a lot of work and a lot of time 
… LSA is huge. We have over 70 
departments.”

LSA senior Nicole Rutherford 

said that after consulting in a 
small group at the forum that 
while they were enthusiastic 
about opportunity housing and 
the positive impacts it could 
have for transfer students, they 
had concerns about some of the 
practical aspects of the plan.

“Some 
questions 
that 
we 

had, that you identified it as a 
hole, is the partnerships with 
departments, what that will look 
like,” Rutherford said.

Some parts of LSA are also 

choosing to launch their own 
efforts alongside the University’s 
strategic plan. Trelawny Boynton, 
director of the Office of Multi-
Ethnic Student affairs, said at 
a different event Tuesday that 
MESA was in the process of 
creating a plan in order to reaffirm 
their place in the community.

“You all have I’m sure heard of 

a strategic plan that’s happening 
campus-wide. Know that we’re 
doing something that is our own 
strategic plan in MESA, so it’s a 
good time to think about why we 
exist,” she said. “We think there’s 

a compelling reason we just want 
to prove it to folks who still need 
to know and be reminded. So, I’m 
going to do a strategic process 
with a whole bunch of our staff 
involved, our student leaders, and 
a group of students that are going 
to guide me through that process.”

LSA senior Eitan Katz, who 

attended the forum, said that 
he likes the plan’s emphasis 
on administration and faculty 
overhauls because of their lasting 
presence at the University.

“To me, a lot of it really focused 

on faculty which I am really happy 
about,” he said. “Students come 
and go every four years, but faculty 
stay here for a lot longer and they 
can have a lot more of an effect on 
the University.”

However, Katz said he is 

concerned about the lack of 
planned student education on the 
principles of the plan, especially 
for first-year students.

“I didn’t see much of a focus 

on orientation,” he said. “And I 
think that’s a big thing because 
students are coming from all 
over the country and it’s a chance 
to have everyone together and 
understand what it means to have 
equity, diversity and inclusion on 
campus.”

Rutherford, in response to 

administrator’s comments, cited 
questions she had about how the 
programs within the plan would 
be evaluated.

“So 
I 
saw 
some 
of 
the 

measurables in terms of we know 
that this part has gotten off the 
ground if we receive this by this 
date, but I’m wondering about 
some of the back end,” Rutherford 
said. “Are we seeing this program 
have the effect that we are hoping 
to, maybe some of the climate 
effects that we’re hoping to see 
overall? And wondering at what 
point some of those evaluations 
might happen and in what way.”

sovereignty while not giving the 
union enough authority to make 
up for a loss of strength at the 
national level.

He said one example of 

the power vacuum was the 
European debt crisis, caused 
in part by a global economic 
downturn beginning in 2009. 
Because the EU has limited 
the powers of member states 
to regulate their own currency, 
countries like Greece were hit 
harder by the crisis, but the 
impact of the EU to help was 
muted.

“The 
European 
Union 

eliminated Greece’s power to 
regulate its own currency and 
to react locally to pressures 
of a downturned economy,” 
Halberstam 
said. 
“At 
the 

same time, they did not give 
the 
European 
Union 
the 

corresponding powers to ship 
money into Greece.”

Overall, 
Halberstam 
said 

he 
saw 
Brexit 
as 
Britain’s 

attempt to gain national power 
and distance itself from an 

ineffectual EU that had little 
power to begin with. He noted, 
however, that the process is still 
far from done — the UK now 
needs to notify the EU Council 
of its intention to leave

“That would set into place a 

two-year period, during which 
they can negotiate a ‘divorce 
agreement,’ ” Halberstam said.

Once 
this 
two-year 

period begins, Britain must 
negotiate 
new 
trade 
deals 

and border agreements with 
the remaining 27 EU nations. 
As 
a 
result, 
politicians 
in 

Britain are currently debating 
how to swiftly go about with 
negotiations but also notify the 
EU of the country’s intention to 
leave.

Panelists also discussed a 

number of other ramifications 
of 
Brexit, 
such 
as 
the 

resignation of former British 
Prime Minister David Cameron 
in June following the vote.

“The UK might not be left 

anymore, all you might have is 
‘little Britain,’ not ‘Great Britain 
anymore,” 
Halberstam 
said. 

“That’s going to be something 
that the UK doesn’t want and 
David 
Cameron 
certainly 

doesn’t want to be remembered 
as the man who destroyed the 
United Kingdom.”

The current prime minister 

of the UK is Theresa May, a 
member of the Conservative 
Party, selected after Cameron 
stepped down. May became the 
second female to occupy the 
role since Margaret Thatcher 
resigned in 1990.

Looking beyond the UK, Jones 

also noted the the implication of 
Brexit for Russia, saying a weaker 
EU will lead to greater Russian 
strength in the long term. He 
said this could be a concern 
given Russia’s 2014 forceful 
annexation of the Ukrainian 
peninsula of Crimea, and plans it 
may have beyond that.

“The UK was central to the 

EU’s 
strength, 
which 
really 

means the UK was central to 
the EU’s unity,” Jones said. “The 
UK was viewed as the biggest 
anti-Russia proponent within 
the EU, and the biggest problem 
for Russia when it came to 
negotiations with the EU.”

“Dipped 
in 
chocolate, 

bronzed in elegance, enameled 
with grace, toasted with beauty. 
My Lord, she’s a Black woman.”

You may remember seeing 

this quote from Yosef A.A. Ben-
Jochannan in a piece I wrote 
last semester about my identity 
as a Black woman. In that piece, 
I am confident, I am poised and 
I am proud of who I am. But, it 
wasn’t always this way. I used 
to struggle to find things I liked 
about myself, and viewed my 
Blackness as a dark shadow that 
covered who I really am.

But today, I know my identity 

as Black woman makes being 
me so much better. I’ve come 
to embrace who I am and all 
the other things I love to do, 
like traveling. This summer, I 
had the amazing opportunity 
to study abroad in Tokyo, 
Japan. It was such an incredible 
experience; 
I 
even 
went 

spelunking 50 feet underneath 
Mt. Fuji. Being immersed in a 
foreign culture, pushing myself 
to reach new heights and taking 
risks helped me finally break 
out of the shell I used to hide in 
for so many years.

I’m so humbled and honored 

to be one of the senior editors 
for Michigan in Color this 
semester. I’ve joined Michigan 
in Color after reporting for 
the news section at the Daily 
for three years. As a reporter, 
I was deeply impacted by the 
significant underrepresentation 
of minority voices on campus 
and a disregard for all the 

wonderful 
stories 
students 

of color at the University of 
Michigan have to tell. I love 
Michigan in Color because it 
provides a space for minorities 
to feel empowered. My greatest 
hope is that my work with 
Michigan in Color allows me to 
help highlight amazing stories 
from students of color within 
our community.

But as much as I want to 

provide a platform for my 
fellow PoC, I also want to find 
and strengthen my own voice. 
I’ve had many struggles at the 
University that have shaped 
me into the woman I am today, 
many of which were a direct 
result of my identity as a Black 
woman. I used to be ashamed of 
being a Black woman and spent 
so much time wishing I was 
someone else. But today, I’m 
proud of who I am and all the 
adversity I’ve overcome.

Someone out there needs 

help. Somewhere, there’s a Black 
girl who despises her kinky hair. 
Somewhere, there’s someone 
who looks in the mirror and 
wishes 
they 
were 
someone 

else, just like I did. I believe 
my testimony and experiences 
can be used as medicine for 
others who are facing similar 
struggles.

Expressing myself, discussing 

my struggles and telling my 
story has been hard, but I hope 
writing for MiC helps me find 
my voice and gives me the 
courage to finally talk about my 
journey with others.

Cheers to a new start and to 

all the incredible stories I hope 
to tell and hear.

Hi, my name is Ashley and 

I’m a sophomore in the College 
of Literature, Science and the 
Arts. On campus, I am involved 
in a number of social justice 
groups including the Michigan 
Community Scholars Program, 
the Program on Intergroup 
Relations 
and 
the 
Detroit 

Partnership. As a part of 
these organizations, I became 
frustrated with the lack of 
resources for students of color 
to voice their experiences, 
especially in the face of systemic 
discrimination. Joining MiC 
was my way to give back to 
communities of color at the 

University of Michigan, while 
also expanding my reflections 
on how my social identities 
impact my outlook on life. 

As an Asian woman, my 

relationship with my racial 
identity has been somewhat 
complicated. For most of my 
life, I viewed race in the black-
white binary. I struggled to 
understand if I was indeed 
a privileged member of the 
“Model Minority” or another 
recipient 
of 
oppression 

among communities of color. 
While microaggressions and 
discrimination were, and still 
are, daily rituals, I was afraid 
to rock the boat among my 
predominately 
white 
school 

and circle of friends. Before, 
I 
was 
afraid 
to 

explore my racial identity for 
fear of the cognitive dissonance 
which 
would 
arise 
from 

questioning the system I lived 
my entire life in. Since coming 
to the University, however, the 
unease has begun to fade. I 
now identify as a proud person 
of color and being a part of the 
MiC community is a big reason 
why.

Ideally, I believe MiC can 

become the main outlet for 
students of color to read and 
express 
their 
frustrations, 

experiences, culture and pride, 
while not being afraid to post 
“controversial” content. MiC 
is a place both students and 
student organizations can use 
to share their stories with the 
student body, with the goal 

to 
spark 
conversation 
and 

dialogue around campus. Here, 
people of color can find others 
living similar experiences to 
their own, and in the process 
find 
clarity 
to 
their 
own 

questions on their identity and 
voice at this University, and 
raise their MiC.

MiC isn’t just a section of a 

newspaper or another page to 
read. It is a living document 
of the struggles and triumphs 
people of color experience 
throughout campus and life. We 
are a community of strong and 
inspirational students, faculty 
and alumni who support and 
affirm each other through our 
shared experiences.

Be ready to raise your voice.
Be ready to raise your MiC.

Before college, back when 

I thought those times would 
be the most stressful part of 
my life, I would always call my 
friend who lived too far away 
and tell her that I needed to 
“find myself.” Her response 
would always be the same “Now 
what does that evenmean?” 
and my response would be 
the same “Well, um, I mean, I 
don’t know,” which I thought 
beautifully articulated the fact 
that I was completely lost on 
who I was as a person.

Narratives 
of 
Asian 

Americans in general, ran thin 
in the area I grew up in. I was 
only offered the stereotypes of 
what others told me; I was to 
accept them as truths, and I did. 
After all, my parents are super 
strict and my food is really 
weird, right? To accept these 
stereotypes was to ensure a 
(false) sense of safety and avoid 
ridicule in my mind. In a sense, 
I lost my voice. In hindsight, 
maybe that is why I would 
always complain about finding 
myself in one way. I didn’t 
know what it meant to celebrate 
myself as a person of color, and 
I 
didn’t 
want to fully 

admit my shame as one too.

But as time passed, my 

submission was more harmful 
than helpful. Little by little, 
I stood up to peers, teachers 
and strangers who wanted to 
dictate how I should think with 
no idea of the experiences of 
being marginalized because it 
definitely was way more than 
about getting my feelings hurt. 
I researched all I could to learn 
more about my cultural heritage 
as an antidote for poisonous 
stereotypes. 
Holding 
my 

ground felt much better than 
being metaphorically pinned 
down.

In college, in the midst of 

highly demanding academics, I 
was drawn to Michigan in Color 
because of how brave, honest 
and unapologetic each story 
every contributor had to offer as 
people of color. I loved, and still 
love, the freedom of allowing 
expression in all forms outside 
of written pieces like audio 
and visual art. I want to raise 
minority voices up, because I 
know how it is to be torn down.

To make others heard, not 

silenced

To make others strong, not 

shameful

To 
make 
others 
find 

themselves, like MiC has made 
me is why I chose my role.

CHRISTIAN PANEDA

Senior MiC Editor

I’m a workaholic. I love to 

plan out my days to maximize 
productivity — no 15 minutes 
can go unused. People who have 
worked with me before know 
me for wanting to streamline 
everything so that I can pack 
more activities into each busy 
day. 
But 
between 
classes, 

meetings, readings, essays and 
exams, it’s often hard to both 
find peace of mind on campus 
while still being productive. 

Michigan in Color has been 
just that — the work we do is 
cathartic more than stressful.

As a minority, I’ve spent a lot 

of my life looking for the right 
group — I’m a feminist, but 
not a white woman; Pakistani, 
but not Muslim; Parsi, but not 
Indian; American, but first 
generation. The contradictions 
never end. Navigating other 
people’s confusion about my 
identity — after all the “come 
to church with me” and “are 
you sure you’re Pakistani?” 
— ultimately left me with a 
stronger 
sense of self. It’s 

not that I don’t fit anywhere, but 
rather that I fit into a number 
of different spaces. It taught 
me that identity is more than 
the logistics — where you’re 
from, what religion you follow 
— and more than what others 
(read: majority) ascribe to you, 
but rather being able to self-
identify.

I 
currently 
serve 
as 

co-director of the South Asian 
Awareness Network, a South 
Asian social justice student 
organization. SAAN has been 
an outlet for South Asian 
American solidarity and a place 

to understand my role in social 
change. My experience with 
SAAN ultimately led me to MiC 
as a space to engage with other 
communities of color. Michigan 
in Color has been the space to 
not only explore these many 
identities, but to be surrounded 
by a group of people who share 
the identity of being a frustrated 
person of color with too many 
experiences and feelings to 
unpack alone. For the first time, 
I’ve found a group of people 
who share my worldly angst.

MiC makes the long hours 

worth it. 

SABRINA BILIMORIA

Senior MiC Editor

Not limited to the biological 

anatomy in the formal sense, our 
voices are the means through 
which we communicate our 
perspectives, our experiences, 
our beliefs. Our voices give 
weight 
to 
our 
thoughts, 

validity to our experiences and 
translate the intangibility of 
the complexity of the human 
experiences 
into 
narrative, 

reflection and wisdom. Our 
voices are our essence.

What happens when you’re 

told you don’t have a voice? That 
your voice isn’t important? It 
doesn’t have the right timbre? 
It sounds “funny?” Not “smart 
enough?”

I didn’t think my voice had 

any power. When it came to 
talking about race, I doubted 
myself. 
There 
was 
always 

someone more eloquent, more 
creative, more interesting than I 
was. My voice wasn’t important. 

My story wasn’t inspirational, 
it was shameful. Coming from 
a poor Black family where 
struggle was normalized, I felt 
like more of a trope, a number, a 
stereotype than an actual person 
with experiences. When I tried 
to speak, it sounded robotic 
and foreign; I felt phony and 
restrained in the way I spoke 
about myself. I kept my past and 
home life a secret. People didn’t 
know about me because I didn’t 
want to know myself. 

Performance freed me of 

these insecurities and doubts. 
When I was on stage, I felt strong 
and sure. I could easily connect 
to a character. A person whose 
emotions and experiences were 
different than my own, even as 
I continued to disconnect myself 
from my own emotions and 
experience. Instead of liberation, 
performance, for me, was an 
escape. A survival tactic. Life 
at the University of Michigan 
as a person of color, especially 
in conversations about race, 
sometimes felt more like a like an 

act than performing did.

As a new student to the 

University, 
I 
joined 
the 

Educational Theatre Company, 
a theater troupe on campus that 
focused on peer education and 
explored topics of social justice 
and campus climate through 
performance. 
Through 
my 

work with ETC, the boundaries 
that society, structurally and I, 
personally, had placed on the way 
I allowed myself to think about 
my story started to blur. I realized 
my story and experiences were 
important. For the first time, 
my voice was developing and I 
could recognize it. It sounded 
real. Through performance, I 
found community and engaged 
in conversation with others who 
were feeling and experiencing 
similar and different things from 
myself. These conversations took 
place in sketches, monologues 
and 
theater 
sculptures. 

Performance was instrumental 
in my self-discovery and self-
development. Theater is a tool 
to build and explore community. 

For me, it is both a part of my 
activism and my self-care. It has 
helped me find a voice. It helped 
to give me the courage to start 
to tell my story and share myself 
with my community, especially 
with other people of color. It 
led me to see the importance of 
spaces on campus for students 
of color to connect and explore, 
criticize and create, and share 
and grow together.

I hope to bring performance 

and 
other 
nontraditional 

mediums 
of 
expression 
to 

Michigan in Color. Students of 
color, despite the resounding 
noise 
of 
doubt, 
erasure 

and 
minimization 
of 
your 

experiences present here on 
campus, know that you have 
a voice. Think of Michigan in 
Color as a space for you to start 
or continue to find it. I leave you 
all with this:

Voices of color
loud and radiant amidst
a sea of white noise.
It’s easy to miss the rainbow
when you’re not looking for it.

I have a terrible memory. I 

often find it difficult to recall 
events that happened to me 
throughout a day, let alone 
over the course of a month or a 
year. This has been especially 
disheartening for me now that 
I’m a senior in college. These 
past two weeks I have found 
myself scribbling down every 
pleasant moment I experience 
with immense detail, a desperate 
attempt at documenting a year 
that I know will pass by all too 
quickly and one that I hope I can 
hold onto despite my record of 
forgetting.

I feel as though some of 

the challenges I have with 
remembering 
come 
from 

the fact that I have changed 
immensely over the past three 
years and continue to change 
almost every minute. I have a 
sense of dissociation with who 
I feel I am in this moment and 
who I used to be, even yesterday. 
At the same time, the moments I 
can remember are the ones that 
truly reflect this ever evolving 
self.

One of my clearest memories 

of freshman year is when I first 
stumbled across a Michigan 
in Color article. I remember 
sitting at my dorm room desk 
and 
reading 
through 
then-

editor Carlina Duan’s piece, 
“Our sacrifice, our shame” (one 
of the most read articles ever 

published by the Daily). I was in 
awe of Carlina and her writing. 
She was able to articulate 
her experiences as a second-
generation Chinese American 
woman in a way that I never 
could, and in reading her story 
I could better understand my 
own. Though I hadn’t written 
the piece, I felt that I had been 
given a voice.

The 
feeling 
I 
had 
after 

reading Carlina’s article for 
the first time is something that 
will never escape my memory. 
Since then I have read almost 
every article published by MiC 
and each one has resonated 
with me in one way or another. 
They have brought me closer to 
myself and helped me navigate 
my experiences on this campus. 

They have bonded me with 
communities of color at the 
University of Michigan and 
served as a constant reminder 
of our strength and resilience. 
In sum, MiC has played a 
transformative 
and 
integral 

role during my time here, which 
is why I wanted to become 
involved. I hope to continue 
the wonderful work that MiC 
has been doing — to amplify the 
voices and stories of people of 
color at Michigan, to make bold 
declarations of our existence 
and thriving here — so that even 
when my memories of this year 
become blurred and I forget the 
details of my last fleeting days 
in college, I know I will always 
remember the feeling of finally 
being heard and understood.

Is this thing on: Why MiC matters

ALYSSA BRANDON

Senior MiC Editor

As Michigan in Color returns to campus, we thought it would be a great time to reflect on why MiC 

has been and continues to be a transformative space of healing, growth and exploration for people of color. 
With countless tragedies, acts of violence and police brutality, as we look to each other in these times of 
pain and sorrow, as we struggle to make meaning for ourselves, we lean on the power of unity and we give 
ourselves and our communities space: space to grieve, space to process, to love, to be imperfect. Our stories 
don’t always have endings, our narratives aren’t linear, we’re sometimes cyclical, sometimes messy, but 
always our own. We wanted to introduce ourselves, faces new and old with the stage always set and the 
MiC still live. Michigan in Color is growing, the voices audible, our words visible.


Forced arbitration: It’s a 

tactic used by corporations to 
avoid being held accountable in 
a court of law for detrimental, 
and possibly illegal, activities 
against consumers.

Over the past several years, 

it has become increasingly 
difficult to apply for necessities 
such as an auto loan, a cell 
phone contract or even cable 
and internet service without 
being subjected to a hidden 
arbitration 
clause. 
Time 

Warner Cable, Comcast, Wells 
Fargo and many others use 
this scheme to circumvent 
courts and prevent consumers 
from joining together in class-
action lawsuits, undermining 
the consumer’s ability to seek 
justice in the wake of corporate 
wrongdoing.

These insidious clauses bind 

consumers 
to 
unknowingly 

sign away their access to a 
court, leaving them to deal 
with disputes through private, 
secretive tribunals that favor 
the company over the consumer, 
instead of undergoing a fair 
judicial process. The typical 
consumer never glances at 
the mountain of text in the 
terms and conditions, but a 
surprising number of contracts 
hide these clauses in the fine 
print, 
preventing 
everyday 

consumers from challenging 
predatory practices such as 
hidden fees, fraud and other 
illegal behavior.

For-profit 
colleges 
such 

as ITT Technical Insitute, 
University 
of 
Phoenix 
and 

Everest College are some of 
the largest household names 

that include forced arbitration 
clauses. The ads and jingles hide 
the fact that attending these 
schools 
means 
unwittingly 

signing 
away 
rights. 
For-

profit colleges are run by 
corporations and shareholders 
solely interested in profits, so 
as students shell out tens of 
thousands of dollars for school, 
prospective 
employers 
turn 

them down upon graduation, 
as many employers do not see 
their degrees from for-profit 
colleges as credible.

Thus, 
when 
students 

attempt to sue these colleges, 
many of them discover their 
options are limited by forced 
arbitration clauses. Arbitration 
proceedings are shrouded in 
secrecy, do not use a jury and 
offer few grounds for court 
review. Even clear legal and 
factual errors by arbitrators 
may be an insufficient basis 
for overruling an arbitrator’s 
decision. 
Unable 
to 
take 

for-profit colleges to court, 
students may lose thousands of 
dollars and wind up in crippling 
debt. Yet students are not the 
only ones being thrown to the 
curb because of arbitration 
clauses. 
Obstetric 
patients, 

American Express cardholders 
and even cruise ship employees 
have had their rights stripped 
away for filing class-action 
lawsuits because of what has 
been hidden in fine print. In 
one not-uncommon case, a 
Wells Fargo employee opened 
up a fraudulent account without 
the customer’s knowledge in 
order to boost sales figures. Yet 
even then, the account holder 

would be prevented from suing 
and taking it up to court and 
instead be forced to deal with 
an arbitrator behind closed 
doors.

To combat these dangerous 

and illegitimate clauses, Public 
Citizen, a nonprofit consumer 
advocacy 
organization, 

petitioned the U.S. Department 
of Education and the U.S. 
Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau to restrict pre-dispute 
arbitration 
clauses. 
Both 

agencies have proposed rules 
to limit arbitration clauses. 
While the proposed rules fall 
short of banning arbitration 
clauses outright — and both 
still need to be strengthened 
— they represent a critical step 
forward in the fight against 
these dangerous clauses and 
are expected to be finalized 
before the current president 
leaves office. If you are looking 
to 
become 
involved, 
get 

involved at Public Citizen and 
fight forced arbitration clauses 
on the floor by telling your 
members of Congress today.

Forced 
arbitration 
is 
a 

scam that forces individuals 
into giving up their rights 
in exchange for the ability 
to participate in the modern 
American marketplace. Law-
breaking corporations should 
not simply be able to say “no 
thanks” to our system of justice 
by sneaking arbitration clauses 
into the fine print of everyday 
terms of service.

The fine print of for-profit schools

BRENT KIM | OP-ED

Who is Trump’s team, really?

CJ MAYER | COLUMN

“A

nd you have to be 
smarter than they 
are. I hear so many 

times, ‘Oh, I want my people to 
be smarter than I am.’ It’s a lot 
of crap. You want to be smarter 
than your people, if possible.” 
— Donald Trump (2007)

Throughout 
the 
election, 

you’ve 
heard 
the 
same 

argument 
when 
discussing 

Trump, his policy and how 
he’ll 
improve 
the 
country: 

He’s got the best guys and 
he’ll listen. Not only is this 
argument incredibly flawed, 
it’s just plain wrong. If this 
is the default response in 
policy debates from Trump 
supporters, there’s no point 
in having in-depth debates 
without first dissecting this 
logic.

First, what if Trump did 

have the best advisers? Is that 
enough to make him a good 
world leader? Unfortunately, 
that’s 
not 
how 
the 
world 

works. Contrary to what you’ll 
hear from either side, many 
policy issues are outstandingly 
complicated with no single 
clear-cut decision to be made. 
Experts in everything from 
economics to education, even 
though they know their topic 
more than anyone else in the 
world, still disagree with one 
another. It’s up to the president 

to take their factual arguments 
and disseminate them. Sitting 
in the dark residential office 
‘til the sun rises, pouring over 
endless pages, wrestling with 
arguments that could lead to 
death of American soldiers or 
lead to poverty for millions 
and deciding what is best for 
the American people — that 
is the president’s job. It’s 
why a president’s judgments 
and policy opinions matter 
and why simply listening to 
advisers is not enough to lead 
the free world.

Now let’s bring attention 

to his advisers, and let’s start 
with Roger Ailes, the man 
preparing 
Trump 
for 
his 

debates. He spent his past 
two decades creating, leading 
and turning Fox News into 
the right-wing bastion that 
it is now. Why’d he leave his 
successful time at Fox? More 
than 20 people, ranging from 
hosts like Gretchen Carlson 
and stars like Megyn Kelly to 
employees like booker Laurie 
Luhn, have all come forward 
and accused Ailes of sexual 
harassment. 
Ailes 
started 

advising Trump after these 
accusations.

Take Corey Lewandowski, 

Trump’s first (and now fired) 
campaign manager who has 
re-emerged as one of his closest 
confidants. 
Lewandowski 

was the force behind the “let 
Trump be Trump” movement 
and encouraged him to never 

apologize 
and 
to 
attack 

the Gold Star Khan family. 
Trump 
initially 
defended 

Lewandowski after he faced 
charges for battery of a female 
reporter.

That’s not where the story 

ends. There’s so much division 
in the campaign that following 
Lewandowski’s firing, adviser 
Michael Caputo tweeted out 
“Ding dong the witch is dead!” 
(for which Caputo resigned 
the same day) and former state 
director 
Jim 
Baker 
texted 

Lewandowski, mocking him. 
Still think Trump hires the 
best guys and can run the 
United States, even though his 
campaign looks like a disaster?

Campaign 
chair 
Paul 

Manafort became the No. 1 
guy following Lewandowski. 
We’ll skip his controversial 
comments and go straight to 
his deal with Russia. Viktor 
Yanukovych, a Putin puppet 
running for prime minister 
in Ukraine in 2005, hired 
Manafort 
to 
help 
repair 

his image after the Orange 
Revolution, a mass protest 
in Ukraine after it became 
known that Yanukovych had 
rigged the election. Then The 
New 
York 
Times 
revealed 

that hidden in a secret ledger 
in Ukraine was $12.7 million 
listed for Manafort. Experts 
are unclear as to whether he 
still advises in Ukraine. To 
recap: The man in charge of 
Trump’s 
campaign 
helped 

a 
Russian 
puppet 
dictator 

after 
rigging 
a 
democratic 

election and was paid secretly 
upward of $12 million to do 
so. Manafort was finally fired 
after The Times’ story.

Can we top that? Trump’s 

newest leader, campaign CEO 
Steve Bannon, is the former 
head of far-right (and I mean 
far-right) 
Breitbart 
News. 

Under 
Bannon, 
Breitbart 

News authored articles such 
as 
“Birth 
Control 
Makes 

Women 
Unattractive 
and 

Crazy” to “There’s No Hiring 
Bias Against Women in Tech, 
They Just Suck at Interviews.” 
Former Breitbart spokesman 
Kurt Bardella said of Bannon: 
“He 
made 
more 
off-color 

comments 
about 
minorities 

and homosexuals than I can 
recount,” and that if you were 
on 
their 
Brietbart 
News’s 

conference calls, it sounded 
“like 
a 
white 
supremacist 

rally.”

This is all to contrast with 

Clinton, who has had a stable 
inner-circle since 2015, led by 
young, Democratic superstar 
campaign 
manager 
Robby 

Mook, who is known for “an 
aversion to the spotlight and 
an interest in data.” She has 
a team filled with veterans, 
including her chief strategist 
and pollster, and one of Obama’s 
closest allies, Joel Benenson. 
One of the four corner offices 
in her headquarters belongs 
to 
Elan 
Kriegel, 
Clinton’s 

“invisible guiding hand,” an 
analytic genius who has stayed 
completely out of the spotlight 
— his full name had not been 
tweeted since October 2015 
when 
a 
Politico 
Magazine 

profile was published about 
him in early September.

Republicans, as noted in the 

Politico piece, are terrified 
that Trump’s campaign team 
is so lacking of talent that the 
next generation of Republican 
campaign 
operatives 
is 

nonexistent. 
Clinton’s 

campaign is very far from 
perfect, but her advisers are 
of the highest caliber and she 
trusts them enough to keep 
them through difficult times. 
Her campaign is competent.

And then there’s Trump 

— 
Lewandowski, 
Manafort 

and now Bannon at the helm. 
Firings left and right. Disaster 
and division within the ranks, 
from cheering a firing to 
calling for a literal firing squad. 
A head spokeswoman, Katrina 
Pierson, whose penchant for 
lying and ignoring facts can 
stack up pound to pound with 
anyone on TV. A campaign in 
such constant disarray that the 
only people he truly listens to 
are his own children.

His closest ally in the Senate, 

Jeff Sessions, is most famous 
for joking about the KKK. 
According to a testimony by 
Thomas Figures, an assistant 
U.S. attorney in Alabama at the 
time, “Sessions was heard by 

several colleagues commenting 
that he ‘used to think they 
(the Klan) were OK’ until he 
found out some of them were 
‘pot smokers.’ ” His team of 
economic advisers just happen 
to be some of his biggest 
donors. When asked about 
who he consults concerning 
foreign policy on MSNBC’s 
“Morning Joe,” Trump said, 
“I’m speaking with myself, 
number one, because I have a 
very good brain and I’ve said a 
lot of things.” 

What about his campaign 

screams this guy can govern? 
The 
Republican 
National 

Convention, 
completely 

controllable 
by 
Trump’s 

campaign, is a free, four-day, 
nationally covered commercial. 
How’d he do in running that 
great 
opportunity? 
It 
was 

arguably the worst convention 
in political history. For the 
first time ever, people were less 
likely to vote for the candidate 
following the convention.

This is the worst campaign 

in 
American 
history. 
This 

was Trump’s test, and he 
failed. Politics isn’t business, 
and his talents clearly do not 
translate. 
He 
doesn’t 
have 

the skills or the people to 
competently operate in the 
political arena, and he would 
make a disastrous president of 
unknown proportions.

MELISSA STRAUSS | COLUMN

We can’t leave refugees behind

I

n light of the recent 
ceasefire 
agreement 

brokered 
between 

Secretary of State John Kerry 
and his Russian counterpart 
Sergey Lavrov in Syria, I 
began thinking again about 
an 
issue 
that 
is 

close to my heart: 
the Syrian refugee 
crisis. During my 
internship with the 
Truman 
National 

Security 
Project 

this 
summer, 

I 
conducted 
a 

research 
project 

focusing 
on 

U.S. 
policy 

toward 
refugee 

resettlement. 
Throughout 

my research, I found myself 
alarmed by the global response 
to the largest humanitarian 
crisis the world has faced since 
World War II and extremely 
worried for the United States’s 
future 
response 
following 

this 
important 
presidential 

election.

The Syrian refugee crisis 

is something we hear about 
almost daily — and often 
through the lens of highly 
political rhetoric. We’ve all 
heard of Donald Trump’s call 
to ban Muslims from entering 
our country, the fact that 
31 governors have sworn to 
stop admitting refugees into 
their states and numerous 
politicians claim the refugee 
crisis is a window for ISIS 
and other extremist groups 
to 
enter 
our 
country 
in 

“Trojan horse” fashion. In a 
nation built on the premise of 
freedom and security for all, 
this growing trend of fear and 
hate is alarming. While the 
U.S. election in November will 
clearly affect our own lives at 
home, it will also be incredibly 
important for the 4.8 million 
Syrians who have fled their 
homes in search of safety.

The United States has a 

long 
history 
of 
admitting 

refugees from all over the 
world. Providing a safe haven 
for vulnerable populations is 
in our DNA. Since World War 
II, the United States has been 
a global leader on refugee 
resettlement, providing homes 
for 3 million refugees since 
1975. 
This 
year, 
President 

Barack Obama and Secretary 
Kerry have pledged to admit at 
least 10,000 Syrian refugees in 
2016, and 100,000 total world 
refugees by 2017. While these 
are important and meaningful 
steps in the right direction, the 
election this fall has enormous 
implications for our future 
policies regarding refugees. If 

we get it wrong, then we risk 
turning our backs on refugees, 
and thus turning our backs 
on deeply rooted American 
values.

Experts 
argue 
that 

admitting Syrian refugees into 

our country will not 
only maintain and 
restore 
American 

credibility 
abroad, 

but is also essential 
in advancing our own 
national 
security 

interests. 
Ryan 

Crocker, 
former 

U.S. 
ambassador 

to Syria, Iraq and 
Lebanon, 
stated 

that 
“increased 

resettlement and aid helps 
protect the stability of a region 
that is home to U.S. allies.” 
Additionally, 
a 
bipartisan 

group of former U.S. national 
security 
advisers, 
CIA 

directors 
and 
department 

secretaries 
sent 
a 
letter 

to 
Congress 
in 
December 

stating 
that 
“resettlement 

initiatives help advance U.S. 
national 
security 
interests 

by supporting the stability of 
our allies and partners that 
are struggling to host large 
numbers of refugees.” If we 
don’t help ensure the stability 
of our allies, we risk these 
states 
breaking 
down 
and 

giving rise to more extremist 
and hostile groups.

Demagogues 
would 
have 

you believe that terrorists 
will easily slip across our 
borders posing as refugees, 
but 
these 
statements 
are 

highly 
debatable. 
In 
our 

nation’s 
long 
history 
of 

refugee 
resettlement, 
a 

refugee has never successfully 
committed a single terrorist 
attack against us. Since 9/11, 
only 
three 
refugees 
have 

been convicted for terror-
related activities — and none 
of them had any viable plans 
for an attack within the U.S. 
Unlike European countries, 
where refugees often show 
up on their borders without 
the luxury of screening first, 
the U.S. refugee screening 
process constitutes possibly 
the most difficult manner of 
entering the country. Refugees 
must endure a lengthy 18- 
to 
24-month-long 
process, 

involving the UNHCR and 
multiple 
U.S. 
government 

departments. Of the 4.8 million 
registered 
Syrian 
refugees, 

only about 18,000 have been 
referred by the UNHCR to be 
resettled in the U.S.

Once 
refugees 
arrive 

in the United States, they 
are 
connected 
with 
nine 

voluntary 
resettlement 

agencies that help them settle 
into their new communities 
and 
become 
economically 

self-sufficient. A great new 
student 
organization, 
the 

Michigan Refugee Assistance 
Program, 
has 
partnered 

with Jewish Family Services 
to help resettle refugees in 
the Ann Arbor area. The 
group is dedicated to raising 
awareness about the current 
refugee crisis, particularly by 
adding a student voice to this 
crisis while also humanizing 
refugees.

LSA senior Nicole Khamis 

says she decided to start 
MRAP this semester because 
it is a time when local refugee 
resettlement 
agencies 
need 

assistance 
the 
most 
and 

students often feel helpless 
in the face of this incredible 
crisis. “I have little patience 
for any arguments against 
settling refugees in the United 
States for numerous reasons, 
but mainly because they are 
based in xenophobic fears and 
also reproduce the rhetoric of 
Arabs/Muslims as terrorists 
and violent in nature,” Khamis 
says. Additionally, if Donald 
Trump is elected in November, 
Khamis 
believes 
refugees 

will no longer be able to seek 
protection 
in 
the 
United 

States.

Refugee policy is not a 

partisan issue. It is a moral 
one. As the situation in the 
Middle 
East 
worsens, 
the 

United States has an obligation 
to provide assistance to this 
vulnerable population and to 
our allies on the frontlines. If 
xenophobic rhetoric continues 
to 
flourish 
in 
American 

political discourse, we risk 
alienating our Muslim and 
Arab-American 
populations 

— 
possibly 
leading 
some 

vulnerable 
people 
to 
seek 

support and community in 
overseas terror organizations. 
Electing the right person in 
November 
will 
determine 

whether or not we hold true to 
American values or succumb 
to fear and bigotry.

A 1939 poll showed that 

three out of five Americans 
opposed 
the 
resettlement 

of 10,000 Jewish refugees 
fleeing from Nazi Germany. 
Imagine the devastation and 
imagine our nation’s current 
cultural 
fabric 
had 
these 

voices prevailed during that 
time of crisis. We cannot allow 
these same voices to triumph 
today’s context.

Wednesday, September 21, 2016 — 5A

Helen Mirren appears on 

screen first, ready to introduce 
the 51st season of “Documentary 
Now!” as VHS documentary-
esque 
music 

plays on in the 
background, 
almost 
as 
if 

to 
prepare 

the 
audience 

for 
an 
actual 

production. 
Unlike 
short, 

comedic 
skits 

that go for the 
punchline almost 
immediately, 
“Documentary 

Now!” 
is 
invested 
in 

recreating scene-for-scene the 
documentaries 
that 
they’re 

concurrently choosing to roast 
any given week. And because 
of that, this IFC gem has been 
taking the world of comedic 
television by storm.

Attention to detail is the most 

closely associated comment for 
Fred Armisen (“Portlandia”) 
and Bill Hader’s (“Trainwreck”) 
mockumentary 
series 
as 
it 

faithfully reconstructs some of 
the most famous documentaries 
of the past several decades. 
However, on this note, the 
series creates its own spin on 
the 
original 
documentaries 

by adding in absurd situations 
that could only arise from the 
creative minds of “Saturday 
Night Live” alumni. Recurring 
jokes, reminiscent of “SNL,” 
almost make it easy to forget 
that “Documentary Now!” is 
a separate entity from NBC’s 
long-standing comedy beehive. 
However, while “SNL” aims 
to 
produce 
quick 
laughs 

from their viewers through 
the use of obvious props and 

discussions on character flaws, 
the mocking nature that comes 
from “Documentary Now!” is 
subtler — often coming from a 
quick wink or raised eyebrow 
from Hader and Armisen, or 

jokes that blend 
seamlessly 
into 

the 
environment 

the 
duo 
has 

transformed 
into 

their stage. Hader 
and 
Armison’s 

choice to distance 
themselves 
from 

their alma mater is 
a step in the right 
direction, as the 

hard work that goes into their 
low-key jibes clearly pays off in 
the long run.

As November fast approaches 

and election season looms over 
America, the obvious choice for 
the premiere of “Documentary 
Now!” was a parody of the 1993 
documentary “The War Room,” 
which followed Bill Clinton’s 
’92 campaign for presidency 
through two of his top staffers, 
James Carville and George 
Stephanopoulos. 
This 
gives 

Hader the chance to revisit his 
uncanny Carville impression, 
a popular “Weekend Update” 
character during his years as 
an “SNL” regular. Meanwhile, 
Armisen takes on the role of a 
young George Stephanopoulos 
persona, 
Alvin 
Panagoulis, 

who flaunts his presence in the 
campaign.

In the parody titled “The 

Bunker,” Hader plays up the 
ruthless 
Southerner 
and 

Carville-inspired 
Teddy 

Redbones, 
who 
agressively 

pushes his candidate in a 
gubernatorial election though 
the use of false accusations 
and placing racially insensitive 

jockeys on the front lawns of 
their opponent’s supporters. It’s 
obvious that he’ll do just about 
anything to get his candidate 
elected, including taking a 
bullet to the leg and placing 
the blame on the opponent. 
In 
this 
respect, 
Armisen’s 

Panagoulious plays the same 
part, 
which 
is 
hilariously 

executed 
by 
comments 

regarding his attractiveness. 
“I feel like I’m shy….” Armisen 
dreamily 
recalls 
with 
a 

hand gracing his cheek, no 
doubt a silent reference to a 
young Stephanopoulos. Both 
Redbones and Panagoulious 
are 
sharply 
juxtaposed 
by 

their candidate, Ben Herndon 
(Van Epperson, “The Green 
Mile”), who refuses to exploit 
the secrets of his opponent 
for his own selfish gain after 
a moment of prayer and self-
reflection. In fact, Herndon 
furthers his attempts at being 
the 
unpopular 
candidate 

through a general indifference 
in the election itself, being 
more concerned about taking 
one’s shoes off on his carpet 
than the polling numbers. In 
the end, it’s Hader’s character 
that’s filled to the brim with 
emotional outbursts — from 
weeping at an election speech 
to his impassioned persona in 
the election headquarters.

Although there’s a missed 

opportunity in the lack of 
commentary on this year’s 
electoral 
campaign, 
it’s 

probably for the best to keep 
the world of mockumentaries 
separate from the pressures 
of modern politics. If there’s 
any takeaway message coming 
from “The Bunker,” it’s that 
“Documentary Now!” is back, 
and it’s bolder than ever.

TV REVIEW

IFC’s sleeper hit from SNL alumni rings in second season 
with parody of 1993 documentary “The War Room”

Film Column: Age 13, ripe for 

the screen

It’s not easy being 13. And 

that comes as a surprise to no 
one who has ever been that age. 
There is nothing as emotionally 
raw as being on the cusp of 
adulthood, fighting against the 
contrary instincts that tell you 
to simultaneously grow up and 
stay young.

Few 
other 
years 
in 
my 

(admittedly short) life warrant 
such a strong reaction as 13. 
I can see myself so clearly at 
that age, wearing pink jeans, 
listening to Green Day and 
getting 
unwanted 
attention 

from eighth grade boys because 
I got boobs before everyone 
else.

If 
the 
emotional 
content 

of time really is plastic, then 
I was 13 for a decade. The 
limbo between childhood and 
adulthood in my memory feels 
infinite. Thirteen holds my first 
kiss and my first period, my 
first boyfriend breakup and my 
first best friend breakup.

Capturing all that is a lot to 

ask of a 90-minute movie. The 
range and intensity of emotions 
is unlike any other time in life. 
I’ve seen many movies that try 
to look like 13, and fewer that 
try to feel like 13. Almost none 
of them succeed in either quest. 

There is no other film in 

my memory that captures the 
inexplicable feeling of 13-ness 
as Ira Sach’s “Little Men.” No 
other film has been able to 
drive to the heart of youth with 
the same level of reverence and 
poignancy.

The beauty of “Little Men” 

comes in its ability to recreate 
that age for an audience of 
people who are not 13, and 
does so respectfully. It would 
be, and is, so easy to mock 
adolescence — a age that is ripe 
with the sort of awkwardness 
and vulnerability that comedy 
thrives on. That’s not to say 
“Little Men” isn’t funny — it is 
— but its humor comes from its 
two young protagonists, not at 
them.

A scene in which a boy 

struggles to form a coherent 
answer to a question about 
poetry is especially moving. It’s 
so mundane, the way he trips 
over his words and how hard he 
tries to make sense of something 
(unrequited love) that he won’t 
understand for years — if ever. 
That grasping at adulthood that 
Sachs captures so gracefully is, 
for me, the key piece missing 
from other representations of 
this age.

And perhaps I’m so hung 

up on adolescence because, 
in addition to it being such 
a formative age in my life, I 
know a lot of people that age. 
I’ve committed the past three 
summers of my life (and at least 
the next one) to working with 
kids that age. I’ve seen first 
hand what it looks and sounds 
and feels (and smells) like to be 
13. And it looks a whole lot like 
what Sachs has created.

And I think of all the 13-year-

olds I know and I think of the 
representations of themselves 
they are being presented with 
— movies about romance and 
girl fights and bullying. The 
kind of movies I saw at 13 that 
made me wonder: why do I 
not look like that or feel like 
that or talk like that, why does 
my life not look like that? For 
example, “The Lizzie McGuire 
Movie” is supposed to take 
place 
after 
Lizzie’s 
middle 

school graduation. If anything 
is the opposite of the reality of 
middle school, it’s navigating 
a foreign city and seducing an 
older man in order to become 
an international pop star. That’s 
crazy. That’s not what 13 looks 

like. (I acknowledge that “The 
Lizzie McGuire Movie” is a 
classic of American cinema and 
an all around great time, but 
come on.)

In addition to Lizzie on the 

back of a Vespa, I want these 
kids to see these two boys, Jake 
and Tony, who, much like myself 
at that age, have not quite grown 
into their own bodies. The way 
they talk to each other and play 
with each other. The way they 
love each other in a way that 
only 13-year-olds can love each 
other. The realism that pumps 
through their every line and 
movement. 

I think it was the novelty 

of this realism that moved me 
so much. That’s why I found 
myself getting teary-eyed as 
Jake and Tony slung their out-
of-control arms around each 
other. It’s why I cried when they 
sat in the park and talked about 
the girls they liked, and when 
one of those girls ended up not 
liking Tony back, and also when 
Tony was sort of okay with that 
because he was, after all, only 
13.

The facts of the film were 

foreign to my life — I was never 
a boy living above a dress shop 
in Brooklyn and I was never his 
best friend — but watching it felt 
like watching a film adaptation 
of my own memories. “I feel 
like that kid was in my seventh 
grade 
English 
class,” 
my 

friend Jay commented on the 
stuttering poetry analyst. And 
he’s probably right. I knew that 
kid. And I’ve been that kid.

That’s why 13 is an age so 

ripe for the screen. While the 
experiences are diverse, so 
much of the emotional makeup 
is universal. When I see that, I 
feel a nostalgic sort of empathy. 
When a 13-year-old sees that, 
they see themselves reflected. 
All of that combined is the rich 
emotional stew great movies 
are made of.

So, 
why 
aren’t 
people 

making better movies about 
adolescence? I genuinely don’t 
know.

Tastes like breaking the fourth wall.
Devastating British tragicomedy 
‘Fleabag’ is a delightful surprise

Phoebe Waller-Bridge wrote and stars in Amazon’s new comedy

As a storytelling device in film 

and television, breaking the fourth 
wall can be very tricky. On the one 
hand, it becomes tiresome when it’s 
overused, shattering the illusion 
that what you’re watching isn’t real 

life. Yet, having characters show-
case their thoughts out loud can be 
an effective and even clever way to 
humanize them, such as in “Parks 
and Recreation,” “Malcolm in the 
Middle,” “The Office” and “House 
of Cards.” Fortunately for Amazon 
Video’s newest import “Fleabag,” 
the main character’s constant 
acknowledgment of the audience 

is not only inviting, but also quite 
refreshing.

Joining the ranks of other bril-

liant, nuanced Amazon comedies 
like “Catastrophe” and “Transpar-
ent,” “Fleabag” is a deeply layered 
character study that’s as hysterical 
as it is devastating. It’s the type of 
show where you’ll be crying from 
laughter and then, out of nowhere, 

SAM ROSENBERG

Daily Arts Writer

a scene will hit you with an emo-
tional gut punch and a new set of 
tears will begin flowing from your 
eyeballs.

Of course, this 

isn’t to say that 
“Fleabag” is ton-
ally inconsistent; in 
fact, all six episodes 
immaculately bal-
ance 
poignant, 

thought-provoking 
moments 
with 

darkly funny ones. 
Adapted from the 
award-winning 
2013 play, “Flea-
bag” is the story 
of 
an 
unnamed 

woman (Phoebe Waller-Bridge, 
“Broadchurch”) and her daily 
escapades as she deals with rocky 
romances, her troubled relation-
ship with her family, her job at a 
dingy café and the death of her 
best friend, all told through the 
woman’s perspective — her name 
is never uttered on the show, but it’s 
credited as Fleabag.

At the center of it all is English 

actress Waller-Bridge, who is the 
show’s creator, writer and titular 
star. Her performance on-screen 
and off drives the creative engine 
that fuels the guffaw-inducing 
one-liners and surprisingly hon-
est exposition of “Fleabag,” which 
she does through gazing and talk-
ing at the camera. She can’t help 
herself, bluntly telling us about her 
uptight sister Claire, (Sian Clifford, 

“Midsomer Murders”), her reticent 
father (Bill Paterson, “The Kill-
ing Fields”), her awful godmother 
(Olivia Colman, “Tyrannosaur”) 

and her extremely 
handsome hookup, 
whom she simply 
refers to as “Arsehole 
Guy” (Ben Aldridge, 
“Toast”).

And 
while 
the 

comedic scope of 
“Fleabag” 
never 

seems 
to 
waver, 

there’s also a subtle 
melancholy under-
lying 
each 
major 

scene, 
especially 

during 
flashbacks 

that pop up without warning. Even 
in the quieter, more profound parts 
of the show, like in one scene from 
episode four where Waller-Bridge’s 
character barely speaks, “Fleabag” 
makes some compelling points 
about the harsh realities of loneli-
ness, isolation and grief. The sad-
der moments are hard to swallow, 
but they don’t stagnate “Fleabag” 
’s comic rhythm, nor do they blud-
geon the audience with their dra-
matic undertones.

“Fleabag” also stands out among 

other television shows for its depic-
tion and treatment of sex. The 
online premise of the show defines 
the main character as “sexu-
ally promiscuous,” which in most 
mediums is a generally stigma-
tized characterization for a woman 
to have. However, in “Fleabag,” 

Waller-Bridge’s titular protagonist 
is portrayed more as a sexual being 
than as a sexual object.

Instead of resorting to the spec-

tacle of gratuitous, graphic and 
nudity-heavy sex scenes — I’m 
looking at you, “Orange is the New 
Black” — the main character’s sex-
ual forays are much more real and 
frank than you’d expect. Each of her 
sexual experiences with Arsehole 
Guy, ex-boyfriend Harry (Hugh 
Skinner, “Les Misérables”) and a 
buck-toothed bus passenger (Jamie 
Demetriou, “Rovers”) are awk-
ward, bizarre and really uncom-
fortable, but they help ground the 
show. In terms of sex, “Fleabag” 
also highlights body image issues 
and other sexual insecurities with 
a sensitive and sharp eye.

It’s a shame the first season of 

“Fleabag” is only a slim six epi-
sodes, but its brevity might also be 
its saving grace. The show is mas-
terful in its succinctness, each epi-
sode getting straight to the point 
about who exactly this main 
character is, her quirks and faults 
and how they affect her romantic 
and familial relationships. It also 
features what is quite possibly 
the shortest, most minimalistic 
title sequence in TV history. But 
for all its great qualities, “Flea-
bag” ’s breaking of the fourth wall 
gives the show a distinctive edge, 
pulling us into Waller-Bridge’s 
imperfect and wholly entertain-
ing world without ever feeling 
artificial or forced.

FOR RENT

Emma 
Donoghue’s 

bestseller “Room” captured 
the explosive desperation of 
a mother trying to get herself 
and her son out 
of a room. Her 
latest 
book, 

“The 
Wonder,” 

conveys 
the 

urgency to get 
into one.

11-year-old 

Anna O’Donnell 
has not had a 
bite of food or 
a sip of anything other than 
water 
since 
her 
birthday, 

or so she and her family 
claim. Lib Wright, a nurse 
who served under Florence 
Nightingale in Crimea, has 
been asked to watch the girl 
around the clock. Not nurse 
or diagnose her, but to see if 
the girl is indeed a miracle in 
the making. Lib is much more 
inclined to believe she will 
discover subterfuge, not the 
supernatural; 
she 
distrusts 

Anna’s parents, as well as the 
Catholic nun who has also 
been asked to watch the girl.

But the longer Lib stays with 

Anna, increasingly bemused 
as to how the girl seems able 
to survive without food, the 
more she wants to protect 
her — from her parents, from 
those visiting their home in a 
tiny Irish village and leaving 
gifts as if Anna really were 
a miracle in the flesh, from 
the town neighbors who are 
suspicious too. Lib befriends 
William Byrne, a journalist 
who has been charged with 
discovering the truth about 
Anna as well. In his writing, 
he utilizes sardonic wit in 
place of information as Lib 
won’t let him near Anna — at 
first. Eventually, he wins Lib 

over, but whilst meeting Anna, 
the child wins him over. He 
also begins to care about her 
well-being in spite of himself, 
angry that no one wants to 
admit what he can clearly 
see — the girl is dying now, 

regardless if she 
was 
somehow 

managing 
to 

get food before 
what 
people 

are calling “the 
watch” started.

Anna’s brother 

has been dead 
for 
a 
while; 

she is bent on 

getting her dead brother out 
of purgatory and into Heaven, 
but it isn’t clear to anyone but 
Lib how far Anna will go to 
achieve this goal. There is a 
painful family secret involved 
that breaks Lib’s heart; but 
when Lib discovers she’s not 
the first person to learn about 
it, and that previous people 
who knew have done nothing, 
her resolve is stiffened to 
break orders and help Anna, 
before it is too late.

“The Wonder,” like “Room” 

or “Slammerkin,” is impossible 
to put down. (I read it all in 
one sitting, crying for about 
the last 30 pages). While the 
novel is more simply crafted 
than 
some 
of 
Donoghue’s 

other work, her undecorated 
but elegant prose sears the 
image of a dying girl in a room 
into your mind, Anna’s sweet 
raspy voice echos in your ear.

The only aspect in the 

work that applies a little more 
pressure than it needs to is 
Lib’s struggle with navigating 
the 
differences 
between 

watching Anna and nursing 
her. It is abundantly clear that 
Lib, as a nurse, can’t help but 
try to get Anna to a healthier 
place.

Watching 
Lib 
lose 
her 

grasp on ideas she has held 
close to her heart for years, 
due to Anna’s extraordinary 
innocence, 
piety 
and 

selflessness would be sweet 
if it weren’t so raw. As Anna 
softens the blunt edges of 
Lib’s beliefs, Lib is forced 
to confront the capacity for 
cruelty in others.

Donoghue has pinpointed 

and pulled apart a paradoxical 
issue in this novel; she’s 
offering us a story in which a 
woman’s professional opinion 
and knowledgeable position 
is questioned on the grounds 
of her maternal feelings. Just 
when her voice matters most, 
it is willfully tuned out by 
the men in power, who have 
decided Anna’s fate as if she 
has already become nothing 
more than a legend, a tourist 
attraction, a sinless, blameless, 
voiceless symbol.

“The Wonder” may have 

a somewhat happy ending, 
but Donoghue refuses to let 
readers 
forget 
the 
weight 

that’s placed on a tiny girl’s 
shoulders, the power of the 
ghost of redemption, and the 
sobering necessity to speak 
truth of the dead for the sake 
of the living. The book is a 
reminder that hope itself isn’t 
golden, untouched by clouds; 
it is bittersweet; it is the 
acknowledgment of sacrifice 
for the potential of and the 
belief in something better.

‘The Wonder’ explores 
the virtues of sacrifice

For the Love of 

Spock

Arts
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

CBS

Eyebrows fleeky

For 60 years, Mr. Spock has 

remained a cultural icon, an alien 
with an indescribable magnetism. 
Behind 
the 
arched 
eyebrows, 

Leonard 
Nimoy 
is 

equally 
influential 

as an actor and as an 
artistic Renaissance 
man. With “For the 
Love of Spock,” fans 
of “Star Trek,” Nimoy 
or pop culture lega-
cies in general can 
look to the screen for 
two hours of gratu-
itous eyebrow raises 
and perceptive analyses on the leg-
acies of these great men. God bless 
that blunt-bang cut, that silky sto-
icism and those delicately pointed 
ears.

“For the Love of Spock” focuses 

on the creation, development and 
impact of the “Star Trek” charac-
ter Spock, the life and impact of 
Leonard Nimoy himself and direc-
tor Adam Nimoy’s own tumultuous 
relationship with his father. The 
film is an attempt to showcase the 
multifaceted life of his father and 
his monumental cultural legacy.

The documentary is structured 

chronologically, moving from the 
beginning of Leonard’s career as 
an actor to the creation of “Star 

Trek” to Leonard’s death in 2015. 
However, within this time frame, 
the doc discusses Spock, Leonard 
and Adam in a seemingly random 
movement that feels fluid some-
times, while other times seems 
abrupt. At one moment the film 
analyzes the role of Spock as a love 

interest 
with 
a 

magnetic 
attrac-

tion that subverts 
expectations 
of 

manhood, and in 
the next it sharply 
moves to discuss 
how Adam and his 
sister dealt with 
the celebrity of 
the Nimoy name. 
Yet, the somewhat 

jarring structure works, reading 
like a book with chapters rather 
than a continuous storyline. Adam 
does a spectacular job at making 
each segment so wholly intriguing 
that you forget to wonder how one 
moves into the other.

Adam’s creation is equal parts 

media texts and interviews, the lat-
ter composed of commentary from 
Leonard himself, his family mem-
bers and his costars. Retro clips 
from the original “Star Trek” series 
as well as moments from the recent 
cinematic remake, are sprinkled 
throughout, supplemented by pro-
motional posters and fan art that 
together emphasizes the expansive 
and enduring reach of Spock across 

popular culture. The interview tes-
timony is especially interesting — 
“Star Trek” actors and directors act 
as experts in their field to provide 
analyses of Spock as a character 
while offering insight into the com-
plex and influential life of Leonard. 
This technique also bridges the 
generational gap between those 
who watched the original series 
and new fans. Commentary from 
William Shatner (“Star Trek”) and 
George Takei (“Kubo and the Two 
Strings”) is intermingled with 
remarks from J.J. Abrams (“Star 
Wars: The Force Awakens”) and 
Simon Pegg (“Star Trek Beyond”). 
A balanced mix of media and inter-
views works to create an engaging, 
hilarious and insightful explora-
tion of Spock and Nimoys.

One of the most unexpected but 

nevertheless fascinating compo-
nents of the film is its exposure of 
Leonard’s flaws. Through inter-
views with Leonard himself as well 
as his children, the film discusses 
Leonard’s relationship with alco-
hol as a coping mechanism that 
gradually turned abusive and put a 
strain on his family and career. The 
film also dives into the unexplored 
corners of Leonard’s personal life, 
specifically his role as a gener-
ally absent father figure. The film 
doesn’t shy away from the raw and 
the uncomfortable, but ultimately 
smooths the edges with a satisfy-
ingly happy resolution.

B-

Churchill’s Secret

Aired September 11 

PBS

Biographical stories, while com-

pelling in nature, inherently lack 
one of the specific qualities that 
makes film narratives attractive to 
audiences — suspense. Intrinsically, 
stories true to reality automatically 
possess a built-in character arc and 
narrative structure 
that makes render-
ing them on screen 
natural. 
Audiences 

familiar with events 
and figures popu-
lar in history are 
already attuned to 
the trajectory of the 
story and its ending, 
requiring that their 
interest be captured in a different 
way. That’s where the details come 
in: the nitty-gritty of telling a story, 
a new perspective.

“Churchill’s 
Secret,” 
which 

aired Sunday night as part of PBS’s 
“Masterpiece” 
series, 
concerns 

itself with just that — every painful, 
tense moment following the stroke 
suffered by British prime minister 
Winston Churchill in 1953. Based 
on the novel “The Churchill Secret: 
KBO” by Jonathan Smith, the tele-
vision drama addresses a lesser-
known event in the PM’s life, kept 
secret from the world — delving into 
what made Churchill the leader and 
man that he was.

From the moment Churchill 

(Michael Gambon, the “Harry Pot-
ter” series) stutters mid-sentence 
while hosting a group of prominent 
guests, including the Italian prime 
minister, it’s apparent that some-
thing’s not right. The look of panic 
on his face, cross-cut with his wife’s 
strained composure, indicates the 
tense scenes to follow. The stroke, 
which 
incapacitated 
Churchill, 

was kept secret in an effort to help 
the bedridden PM return to power 
once recovered. His determina-
tion to make his last achievement 
as PM “one of peace” before retir-
ing, against the evident wishes of 

Lady Churchill (Lindsay Duncan, 
“Birdman”) and pressure from gov-
ernment party officials, is executed 
poignantly by Gambon. Aside from 
Gambon’s stellar performance as 
an aging PM, still full of life and 
love for his country and his mis-
sion as its leader, Duncan’s Clemen-
tine Churchill meets Gambon with 
equal emotional prowess.

Clementine fulfills her role 

as dutiful wife to 
Churchill, 
while 

also 
providing 

the audience with 
insight 
into 
the 

more 
sentimental 

wounds 
inflicted 

by 
her 
husband’s 

career. Though the 
primary source of 
the film’s conflict 

is Churchill’s stroke, it awakens a 
host of unborn animosity within 
his family. Churchill must deal with 
old family strife, now instilled with 
fresh life by the concentrated efforts 
to rehabilitate him, while continu-
ing to exert all his efforts into his 
career. Old wounds opened under 
new circumstances are poignantly 
portrayed by the film’s outstanding 
cast and conveyed through subtle 
cues in the movie’s execution. At 
one point, the tension erupts at a 
dinner scene between Clementine 
and her children, who unburden 
themselves of years of emotional 
pain inflicted by their father’s 
demanding career. And suddenly, 
Clementine is transformed from 
the loyal wife to an obsessive, over-
ly solicitous shell of a mother whose 
devotion to her husband cost, her 
her relationships with her children.

Though a poignant and extreme-

ly taxing scene, the argument over 
dinner feels like an ambitious cul-
mination of processing years of 
complex emotions in one scene 
— and an early emotional climax 
at that. Just halfway through the 
film, the family’s discord is revealed 
almost all at once, with little closure 
following the scene. 

The second half of the film focus-

es on Churchill’s recovery, facili-

tated by his nurse Millie Appleyard 
(Romola Garai, “The Last Days on 
Mars”). Though her strength in 
character in caring for Churchill 
as if he were any other patient 
shows throughout the movie, Mil-
lie’s own character arc is given spo-
radic acknowledgement. Through 
Clementine’s prodding, the movie 
reveals little spurts of information 
about Millie that don’t tell us much 
about her at all. It’s her dedication to 
Churchill’s recovery and composure 
in the face of the conflict surround-
ing her that makes her an appealing, 
albeit somewhat flat, character.

Equally as static is the execution 

of the film. Though the camerawork 
and editing waste no time in telling 
the story, the film leaves little room 
for variation or discord that could 
have energized the otherwise som-
ber piece. The seamless pans and 
cuts smoothly transition us from 
one scene to the next, mirroring the 
contained efficiency of Churchill’s 
recovery and the story itself.

However, 
close-ups 
reveal 

Churchill’s struggle. After he is 
rushed to his country home to 
receive care, Churchill’s condition 
takes a turn for the worse. When 
they finally arrive at the estate and 
Churchill’s helped out of the car, the 
camera cuts to a close perspective 
of his foot dragging behind him up 
the stairs of his home. In this simple 
shot, the PM’s helplessness is under-
scored –– quickly and effectively 
conveying the significance of his ill-
ness. Moments like these draw the 
audience deeper into the story with 
subtlety and emotion.

These 
minutiae, 
interspersed 

throughout a story full of earnest 
emotion, make this “Masterpiece” 
drama a truly compelling film. 
“Churchill’s Secret” provides us a 
window into the inner life of one of 
the most powerful and skilled lead-
ers in our history without much 
redundant effort. The simplicity of 
the telling of the story, combined 
with the adept work of its actors, 
provides an intriguing look into a 
great man’s life.

Harbaugh keeps opponents guessing

It’s 
clear 
by 
now 
that 

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
is always looking for even the 
slightest edge on his opponent. 
As early as his first spring 
practice at Michigan, he talked 
about trying to get one mile per 
hour faster, one percent better.

That 
competitive 
drive 

spreads to his game plans, where 
the one thing opponents can 
expect is the unexpected.

The 
Wolverines 
picked 

redshirt 
sophomore 
Wilton 

Speight to start at quarterback 
in Week 1 and stuck with him 
for the first two games until the 
outcome was well in hand.

Then, on the third play from 

scrimmage 
Saturday 
against 

Colorado, Harbaugh inserted 
third-string quarterback Shane 
Morris for a single play, with 
redshirt sophomore linebacker 
Jabrill Peppers at running back 
— and used Morris as the lead 
blocker on Peppers’ 7-yard carry.

Why? The short answer is 

because he could, just to throw 
off the Buffaloes’ strategy.

“I think people expected us 

maybe that we might rotate 
quarterbacks in the first game, 
but we didn’t, or the second 
game, so (I) didn’t think they’d 
be expecting it as much the third 
game,” Harbaugh said. “There’s 
some things that Shane does 
well, some things that (backup) 
John O’Korn does well. We 
wanted to highlight them and 
give them a chance to do some of 
those things.”

A few moments later in 

the 
first 
quarter, 
Harbaugh 

reached up his sleeve again. On 
Michigan’s third series of the 
game, the Wolverines already 
trailed 
Colorado, 
14-0, 
and 

faced second-and-10 on the 
Buffaloes’ 48-yard line. Perhaps 
because Speight was still feeling 

a hit from the previous drive, 
Harbaugh put in O’Korn at 
quarterback for one play. O’Korn 
handed off to fullback Khalid 
Hill and then jogged off the field.

Even after playing 17 ball 

carriers and 16 pass catchers 
this season, Michigan’s coach 
still has more in his bag of tricks.

“We 
always 
have 
those 

options going forward, and it’s 
good for your opponent to know 
that you have those options 
going forward,” Harbaugh said. 
“(I) like them to think that all 
things are possible.”

Michigan’s 
next 
opponent 

— Penn State, which visits 
Michigan Stadium on Saturday 
— must now account for all 
of 
them 
in 
its 
game-week 

preparation.

Harbaugh often tries to throw 

curveballs leading up to games. 
In each of his two years at 
Michigan, he did not announce 
a starting quarterback until the 
first snap of the season opener, 
and he said he expected his 
opponent to do the same. This 
year, he has not yet released a 
depth chart before any of the 
four games.

And then game day comes, 

and he always seems to have 
an extra wrinkle — like, for 
instance, using a third-string 
quarterback as a lead blocker.

“I’ve never seen a team switch 

three quarterbacks in during 
a game,” said redshirt junior 
defensive tackle Maurice Hurst. 
“That’s different. I’ve seen two 
quarterback systems — I’ve 
never seen three, and especially 
one lead blocking for one of our 
plays.

“But it’s interesting. I like his 

methods. I like what he does. It’s 
really cool to watch to see how 
our offense executes at times. 
It’s really unique, and I don’t 
think a lot of people are doing it 
like we are.”

Most of Harbaugh’s alterations 

require 
corresponding 

adjustments. 
If 
he 
changes 

running backs, the opponent 
must prepare for different plays. 
If he changes formations — 
which he does on almost every 
play — the opponent must put 
in new personnel. If he changes 
defenses, the opponent must 
block differently or run plays 
differently.

“It’s hard to prepare against 

because there’s such a wide 
variety of things, so you have to 
predict each week what’s going 
to happen almost, like, ‘All right, 
they did this, but I could easily 
see them doing this this week 
versus us,’” Hurst said. “And 
there’s stuff that we obviously 
haven’t shown yet, and stuff that 
the offense hasn’t shown yet, so 
it’s just confusing for a team. It’s 
something they have to prepare 
for every week.”

On offense, the Wolverines 

can play any one of four running 

backs, five wide receivers, three 
tight ends and two fullbacks. On 
defense, Harbaugh has chosen 
a defensive coordinator whose 
tendencies seem to match his 
own — the players say that Don 
Brown, nicknamed “Dr. Blitz,” 
can deploy a new blitz seemingly 
every third down.

In 
the 
coming 
weeks, 

Michigan could roll out even 
more 
tricks. 
Peppers, 
who 

can play almost anywhere on 
the field, still has not played 
significant 
offensive 
snaps 

(which he did not do until the 
Michigan State game in Week 7 
last season). Senior cornerback 
Jourdan Lewis could return as 
soon as this week and be another 
two-way player. And Harbaugh 
could have any number of other 
gimmicks in mind to fluster 
opponents.

“We’ll probably install 15 or 

20 different new plays a week 
or have some different twists to 

plays that we already run,” said 
senior tight end Jake Butt. “But 
that’s all just to make sure that 
we will succeed on Saturdays.”

This week, Harbaugh matches 

up against an opponent that will 
have the same goal of keeping 
its opponent off balance. The 
Nittany Lions have unveiled a 
no-huddle spread offense this 
season to try to jumpstart their 
productivity, 
one 
Michigan 

hasn’t seen before.

And 
while 
Harbaugh 

acknowledged 
the 
difficulty 

of stopping such an attack, he 
hinted that he might have some 
changes in place as well.

“Those are real options for us, 

to change things up,” Harbaugh 
said. “You like to do that. You 
don’t like to just go out and 
show the same alignment and 
assignments 
and 
techniques 

game after game after game. 
You can count on changes, 
adjustments being made.”

Michigan football coach Jim Harbaugh likes his opponents to think “all things are possible” when they play Michigan.

Chesson not satisfied with performance

After lighting up Central 

Florida for a combined 195 
receiving 
yards 
and 
two 

touchdowns in their second 
game of the season, Michigan 
fifth-year senior wide receivers 
Amara 
Darboh 
and 
Jehu 

Chesson looked right on their 
way to becoming the best pass-
catching duo in the Big Ten.

But it was a different story 

Saturday 
against 
Colorado. 

Chesson finished the game with 
no catches, and Darboh had just 
two. Each managed to score 
touchdowns using their feet — 
Chesson turning on the jets for a 
17-yard end-around and Darboh 
riding some great blocks to turn 
a dump-off pass into a 45-yard 
score — but both struggled 
to 
find 
success 
downfield 

against the Buffaloes’ talented 
cornerbacks.

“Offensively, they tested us,” 

Chesson said. “They blitzed 
us really good. Also in the 
secondary, they tested us. But 
we didn’t respond as well as I’d 
like us to respond, and I think I 
can speak for the other leader of 
the receivers, Darboh.”

Colorado 
cornerback 

Chidobe Awuzie was a known 
threat 
coming 
in, 
but 
the 

added bonus of strong play 
from 
fellow 
defensive 
back 

Ahkello 
Witherspoon 
helped 

the Buffaloes shut down the 
Wolverines’ downfield attack 
for most of the game. Darboh’s 
touchdown and sophomore wide 
receiver Grant Perry’s 54-yard 
reception in the third quarter 
were the two longest passes of 
the day for Michigan, and both 
receivers did the bulk of their 
work after the catch.

Luckily for Michigan, redshirt 

sophomore quarterback Wilton 
Speight had a reliable safety net: 
senior All-American tight end 

Jake Butt.

After taking a number of 

hits early on, including a strip 
sack that led to a defensive 
touchdown for the Buffaloes, a 
rattled Speight was finally able 
to recover in the second quarter 
by targeting Butt on short passes 
that ultimately set up two 
touchdown drives.

Butt later downplayed his role 

in the momentum swing, saying 
that the offense was simply 
taking the opportunities the 
opposing defense gave it.

“That’s 
just 
kind 
of 
the 

way the shots were called on 
Saturday,” Butt said. “I don’t 
look at it like we were trying 
to get me the ball to spark the 
team — we were just calling 

the plays and I guess I would 
just pop open and Wilton just 
kind of found me underneath. … 
It’s always good when you can 
help your quarterback get into 
rhythm a little bit, especially 
when he’s getting hit or guys 
aren’t getting open as much as 
they would have liked.”

The Wolverines have the 

luxury of multiple weapons on 
offense if players are having 
an off day, and Speight has said 
previously that he would trust 
any one of his three favorite 
targets in a one-on-one matchup, 
no matter who is playing in the 
secondary. Chesson knows he 
still has that trust, but neither he 
nor Darboh were satisfied with 
their 
personal 
performances 

Saturday.

It wasn’t so much an issue 

of Michigan’s receivers being 
unable to create separation, he 
said, but rather not doing their 
part to make plays in single 
coverage.

“See ball, get ball,” Chesson 

said. 
“It’s 
frustrating 
for 

(Speight), I know, when he 
trusts us to make a play and 
we don’t make a play. It’s also 
frustrating for us, but whenever 
we get the opportunity when 
it’s a one-on-one or whatever it 
is, when the ball’s up in the air, 
that’s the mentality you have to 
have.”

The 
Wolverines’ 
concern 

at the receiver position can’t 
be very high — Darboh and 

Chesson were the third-best 
receiving in the Big Ten last 
year in terms of yardage, and 
that was with Chesson not really 
taking off until the second half 
of the season.

Still, Michigan will need all 

of its receivers — not just Butt 
— to be firing on all cylinders 
against tougher opponents down 
the road, and that fact isn’t lost 
on Chesson. In fact, he’s glad 
there’s still room for the offense 
to develop.

“You don’t want to say this 

is the best it can be, right?” 
he said. “Because if it is, you 
have lots of games to go. ... It’s 
growing, it’s gonna continue to 
grow, and we have no option but 
to get better.”

Wolverines third 
after strong finish

When the first day of the 

Inverness 
Intercollegiate 

wrapped up for the Michigan 
men’s golf team, the Wolverines 
weren’t where they wanted to 
be. After shooting a team score 
of 592, Michigan found itself in 
ninth place out of 13 teams.

But Tuesday, the second and 

final day of the tournament, the 
Wolverines changed that.

Shooting 

a school and 
tournament 
record of 270, 
Michigan 
catapulted 
itself up the 
leaderboard to 
a 
third-place 

finish.

“I told them 

(Monday) 
night 
that 

attitude is one of the few things 
that we’re able to control on the 
golf course,” said Michigan coach 
Chris Whitten. “The execution 
and the bounce of the ball is 
something where you hope for 
the best and want the best, but it’s 
out of your control sometimes. So 
we just had to have an A+ attitude 
and hope that it would bleed into 
the scores, and it did (Tuesday).”

The Wolverines were led by 

sophomore Nick Carlson. The 
righty, 
who 
finished 
fourth 

place 
in 
the 
U.S. 
Amateur 

Championship in August, carried 
his summer momentum to a first-
place tie with a score of 209.

Carlson 
didn’t 
stop 
there, 

though. 
On 
the 
first 
hole 

of the playoff to decide the 
tournament’s 
overall 
winner, 

Carlson hit his approach shot to 
about 15 feet and two-putted for 
a par. His opponent, Jake Shuman 
from Duke, missed the green to 
the right and couldn’t recover, 

finishing with a bogey.

The victory was the first of 

Carlson’s career.

“I think he’s hitting the 

same shots that he always has,” 
Whitten said. “The difference 
is that he believes he can win, 
and he’s expecting to play well. 
I think a lot of people know that 
golf is mostly a mental game, and 
I think (Carlson) is starting to 
figure that piece out. He’s got a lot 
of confidence.”

Carlson 
wasn’t 
the 
only 

Wolverine 
who improved 
on 
Tuesday. 

Senior 
Tom 

Swanson 
tied 

Carlson’s final 
round with a 
67, while junior 
Kyle 
Mueller 

and 
senior 

Bryce 
Evon 

each shot 68 to 
fuel the team’s 

comeback.

The tournament was the first 

in a long season for Michigan, 
which enters the year with a 
mostly returning cast. But in the 
2016-17 season, the Wolverines 
expect even more. Michigan will 
now face a quick turnaround, 
when it travels to Windon, Ill., 
for the Windon Memorial Classic 
on Sunday. But if Carlson and the 
rest of the team can maintain thir 
momentum, they stand a good 
chance of living up to their lofty 
expectations.

“We’ve gone to (the NCAA 

Regionals) the past two years,” 
Whitten said. “I know that the 
Big Ten Tournament is a really 
important one for (the team) — 
and going back to the regionals 
and then going to the national 
championship, 
which 
our 

team hasn’t done in a couple of 
years. But that’s a very realistic 
expectation, 
and 
we’ll 
work 

toward that.”

Wolverines find bearings too late

Last season, the Michigan 

women’s golf team far exceeded 
expectations. The Wolverines 
finished 18th at the NCAA 
Championships despite barely 
being ranked in the top 50. 
And with four of five golfers 
returning from last season, 
this year’s Wolverines seemed 
poised to have another good 
season.

But Sunday, Michigan faced 

the reality that this year isn’t 
last season.

Competing at the East & West 

Challenge at Radrick Farms Golf 
Course — one of the two courses 
owned by the University — the 
Wolverines got off to a slow 
start, finishing fifth out of eight 
teams on Day 1. Michigan shot a 
first-day total of 598, 15 strokes 
behind fourth-place Oregon.

The three-day tournament 

was structured so that the first 
day consisted of 36 holes of 
team-stroke play, with the top 
four teams and the bottom four 
teams competing in a match-
play winners and consolation 
bracket, respectively. By placing 
fifth, the Wolverines went to the 
consolation bracket to face off 
against eighth-place UC Davis.

Michigan’s 
struggles 
only 

continued Monday, as the team 
fell to UC Davis, 3-2, in the 
consolation bracket semifinal. 
Junior Megan Kim, senior Grace 
Choi and sophomore Elodie Van 
Dievoet — all veterans from last 
year’s NCAA tournament — 
faltered in their matches.

“We had a couple of rough 

stretches 
on 
the 
36-hole 

day, which kept us out of the 
championship 
bracket,” 
said 

Michigan coach Jan Dowling. 
“And we hit a UC Davis team 
that putted really well and got 
us thinking about needing to 
improve our putting.”

Even though the Wolverines 

couldn’t find their sense of 
direction Day 1 and Day 2, there 

was still another day to get 
on course against Big Ten foe 
Nebraska. And as if Michigan 
were using the sextant for the 
first time after sailing blind, get 
on course is what they did.

All of the Wolverines finally 

put a complete round together, 
beating the Cornhuskers, 5-0, 
to secure seventh place in the 
tournament. Choi and Kim won 
their matches 1-up, while juniors 
Kathy Lim and Emily White 
— the only Wolverines to win 
their matches against UC Davis 
— won commandingly, 4-and-3 
and 3-and-2, respectively.

“We played really well today; 

we finished the tournament 
on a high note,” Dowling said 
about Tuesday’s match. “We 
certainly have some work to do 

and exposed some weaknesses, 
but we’re ready to work.”

A bright spot for Michigan, 

though, was freshman Alisa 
Snyder, who was competing 
in 
her 
first 
collegiate 

tournament. Snyder took part 
in the individual competition 
comprising of players that are 
not part of each team’s five-
person lineup.

Snyder shot 157 on Day 1 to 

qualify as the No. 3 individual 
golfer. In Monday’s semifinal, 
Snyder defeated No. 2 seed Kate 
Granahan from Penn State, 
before falling to the No. 1 seed 
from Kentucky in the Individual 
Match Play championship.

“She’s 
gaining 
some 

confidence 
and 
some 

experience 
as 
a 
collegiate 

golfer, and it’s a big step from 
junior golf to collegiate golf,” 
Dowling said. “I’m thankful 
she got the experience and got a 
tournament under her belt.”

Dowling also said she realizes 

one of the difficult parts of a 
new season is keeping up the 
momentum from the last one. 
Since the golf season is made 
up of both a fall and spring 
season, the fall season can be 
used to identify weaknesses and 
develop the players.

“I don’t think there is a team 

in any sport that plays their best 
every single week,” Dowling said. 
“It’s a great motivation how you 
react to it. I wouldn’t say we’re 
thrilled with our finish, but at the 
same time we have to learn what 
didn’t go well and get better.”

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily

The Michigan women’s golf team finished seventh out of eight teams at the East & West Challenge this week.

Evenson making another splash

Before 
she 
joined 
USA 

Triathlon, Avery Evenson had 
ridden a road bike maybe twice in 
her life.

But that didn’t stop her from 

making a huge splash at her debut 
race.

On June 29, 2013, just five 

months after she joined USA 
Triathlon, she competed in the 
Vila Velha PATCO Triathlon 
Pan American Championships. 
Evenson notched sixth place and 
completed the grueling course in 
1:06:38, only one minute behind 
the winner — her teammate 
Tamara Gorman.

“It was definitely a huge 

adjustment just learning how to 
clip in. Learning how to go on 
an hour ride and not tip over at a 
stoplight,” Evenson said.

Now, Evenson is a junior on 

the No. 10 women’s cross-country 
team, and despite suffering an 
injury last spring that kept her 
from running until mid-July this 
year, Evenson has made a similar 
early impact at Michigan.

***

Much has been written about 

Wolverine senior Erin Finn, and 
justifiably so. A three-time All-
American runner, Finn has looked 
better than ever this season, 
rocketing her way to victories at 
both of the Wolverines’ 5,000-
meter races, finishing 45 seconds 
ahead of the runner-up each time.

Evenson’s 
statement 
at 

Michigan’s 
first 
two 
meets, 

though, shows that she may share 
some of the spotlight with Finn.

Just like at her first triathlon, 

Evenson made a huge splash for 
the Wolverines at the Michigan 
Open on Sept. 2 and the Sycamore 
Invitational on Sept. 10, finishing 
third at both. Evenson posted 
times of 17:43.6 and 18:01.0, 
respectively.

“Even 
though 
she’s 
a 

newcomer, she seems like one 
of the veterans,” said Michigan 
coach 
Mike 
McGuire. 
“She’s 

very businesslike, very mature 
with a businesslike approach 
to what she’s doing. It’s been a 

really seamless transition in my 
opinion.”

Making an immediate impact 

has been a staple for Evenson 
since she was at Hartland High 
School.

In her first ever high school 

meet on Aug. 25, 2009, Evenson 
won the 5,000-meter race with 
a time of 19:15.04. She finished 
1:37.08 ahead of her nearest 
competition, 
teammate 
Anna 

Pasternak, who was two years 
older than Evenson and had 
finished 62nd out of 242 runners 
at the Michigan Division I State 
Championships the year before.

“I honestly just love to race,” 

Evenson said. “I don’t think about 
it. I just show up on the line and 
and give it all I have. I think that 
feeling after my first race back in 
high school was just like, ‘Wow! 
I didn’t know that was going to 
happen!’ I just toed the line. I’m 
just a racer I guess.”

Evenson then proved that her 

breakout performance was no 
flash in the pan.

She ran to a runner-up finish at 

the 2009 State Championships in 
18:10.3, leading the Eagles to 15th 
place out of 28 teams. She placed 
11th in her sophomore year with 
a time of 18:01.7 and 5th in her 
junior year at 17:57.2. Still, her best 
time in high school was 17:40.6 — a 
school record — against Brighton 
on Oct. 28, 2011.

At the same time, she excelled 

at long-distance track running, 
breaking 
(and 
still 
holding) 

Hartland’s records in every race 
greater than 800 meters except 
for the 2,400-meter race.

But during her senior year, 

Evenson made the decision to 
train with USA Triathlon, as 
she had been on the swim team 
at Hartland and was skilled at 
cycling. 
She 
graduated 
high 

school one semester early and 
would forego her last year of 
eligibility in cross country and 
track for the Eagles.

***

After her spectacular 2013 

triathlon debut, Evenson never 
slowed down.

She 
finished 
fifth 
at 
the 

2014 Junior World Triathlon 

Championship and took fourth 
place 
at 
the 
2015 
Under-23 

World Triathlon Championship. 
Evenson’s 
success 
had 
her 

preparing for triathlon tryouts for 
the 2016 Summer Olympics.

“I think I really grew in those 

three years as a triathlete,” 
Evenson said. “I learned how to 
be successful when you’re not 
training. So recovering right, 
eating right, doing all of the little 
things that I can control.”

Unfortunately 
for 
Evenson, 

her injury prevented her from 
competing in the tryouts as well 
as competing for the Big Ten-
Champion 
Michigan 
women’s 

track team in 2016, but she still 
has her eyes set on 2020.

“After I’m all done with my 

eligibility, I plan to go back to 
training for triathlon,” Evenson 
said. “It’s one of the reasons I went 
to NCAA running. I knew that my 
run needed work if I ever wanted 
to be on an Olympic team, if I ever 
wanted to stand on a podium at 
the Olympics. My run needed to 

be faster.”

***

Evenson’s injury last spring only 

hardened her desire to be a part 
of a Big Ten title team, whether in 
cross country, track or both.

“It’s 
honestly 
the 
most 

motivating thing ever,” Evenson 
said. “We want that feeling again. 
Coach says it’s all about the 
process. We’re ranked pretty high 
up, but he’s like, ‘We have to earn 
it every day.’ ”

And for Evenson, her triathlon 

experience might prove to be a 
unique asset in achieving that 
goal.

“It makes a cross country race 

look like a sprint,” McGuire said. 
“She’s so aerobically strong and fit 
from everything that she’s done 
in the pool, on the bike over the 
years. I think if we continue to 
keep her healthy, I think she’s just 
starting to scratch the surface.”

Avery Evenson has made an early impact for the Wolverines.

ROWING
Elmore returns golden

Amanda Elmore isn’t exactly 

sure what her future holds. She’s 
just excited to finally be back in the 
lab. But this time around, she has a 
gold medal to her name. 

Elmore, a Michigan graduate 

student, was selected to represent 
Team USA at the Rio Olympics for 
the women’s eight rowing team. 
After years of training, for which 
she put her education on hold, 
Elmore came home with the gold. 

Elmore’s 
doctoral 
thesis 

adviser, Patrick Schloss, threw 
a party to welcome her home 
and allow her research team to 
celebrate her Olympic journey. 
Elmore wasn’t shy about sharing 
her medal with her peers, allowing 
anyone the opportunity to hold or 
get a picture with her hardware.

“It was an amazing experience 

competing at the Olympics for 
Team USA,” Elmore said. “I’ve 
been working with the national 
team training center for over two 
years now, and to get to be apart 
of the women’s eight — (which) 
hasn’t lost a race in 11 years now — 
was the most amazing experience 
of my life.”

Elmore wasn’t always a rower, 

though. She started rowing during 
her sophomore year at Purdue. She 
walked on to the team and quickly 
learned that she could have a 
future in the sport.

Some of her many accolades 

include Purdue’s Most Valuable 
Oarswoman in 2012 and 2013 and 
ACRA First Boat All-American 
honors in 2011, 2012 and 2013.

After graduating from Purdue, 

Elmore 
arrived 
at 
Michigan 

to join the graduate program 
in biomedical sciences in the 
Department of Microbiology and 
Immunology. With a season of 
eligibility left, she looked to see if 
she could compete as a Wolverine.

As it turned out, she could. 

During her time rowing for 
Michigan, she helped the team to a 
second-place finish at the Big Ten 
Championships and earned All-

Big Ten First Team recognition.

“I remember asking her, ‘So 

are you good?’” Schloss said. “She 
said, ‘Well, I’m OK,’ and here she 
is now years later and she’s the 
best in the world. So, is she good? 
Come on.”

Once her college rowing days 

were over, Elmore thought it 
was finally time for her to focus 
solely on her graduate studies. 
That was until she received a 
phone call from the national team 
coordinator asking her to come 
train at the national team training 
center.

“I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t 

a little bit disappointed because 
she’s an amazing student and 
person, and we wanted her a part 
of our research group,” Schloss 
said. “But, how could I say no? 
That’s my job, I think, to help my 
students do well in life, whether 
it’s in science or on a boat.”

Elmore decided it wasn’t an 

opportunity she could pass up. She 
moved to Princeton, N.J., where 
the national team training center 
is located, and set her sights on the 
Olympics.

But, she didn’t abandon her 

studies completely. She kept in 
touch with her lab through Skype 
phone calls and e-mails and did 
work on her laptop anytime she 
could — all while competing 
against 30 other women for the 
nine spots in the boat that would 
compete in Rio.

Now that the Olympics are over, 

Elmore has to make the transition 
from athlete back to scientist. 
Though, she doesn’t think it will 
be a tough one.

“My education has always 

been my priority,” Elmore said. 
“Growing up, I always did sports, 
but I always put my academics first 
and then that was a side hobby to 
keep me fit and competing and 
having fun.”

That balance was never more 

difficult than when she was 
training for the Olympics while 
working toward a Ph.D.

But Elmore seemed to manage 

just fine.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | SEPTEMBER 21, 2016


A

t The Michigan Daily copy 
desk, we contour articles 
before they’re presented to 

the public — or, rather, the Daily 
Stylebook does. We comb through 
each article, checking for every-
thing as obvious as getting the facts 
right and as seemingly insignificant 
as the use of a semi-colon, pausing 
repeatedly to consult the Stylebook. 
The final product stands alone, 
though stripped of Oxford commas 
and laced with abbreviated titles, 
and almost always at least slightly 
different from how it came in.

Between the reliance on the style 

guide and the precision of the end 
product, I’ve realized copyediting 
an article isn’t so different from 
copyediting yourself. Think before 
you speak, check yourself before 
you wreck yourself — however you 
want to say it, everyone has a meth-
od for filtering their actions and 
words. We work hard to create and 
maintain an image for ourselves, 
constantly building from and refer-
ring back to our own personal style 
guides.

What makes up a style guide, 

though? Clearly, not everyone fol-
lows the same one. And it’s not 
possible for everyone to follow the 
same one, since different back-
grounds and opportunities deter-
mine what different people have 
been exposed to. But we build onto 
these when we start to choose our 
own experiences and communities, 

and we adjust the way we filter.

One of my chosen communities 

was the Residential College. My 
first semester there, I had a nagging 
worry that the things I was doing 
and saying weren’t quirky or pro-
gressive or eco-conscious enough. 
These traits, which the people 
around me seemed to have in abun-
dance, worked themselves into an 
RC Style Guide, which I worked into 
my own. I started tailoring specific 
actions to it, and they’ve become 
ingrained in me the same way rules 
regarding when a certain hyphen 
is appropriate or when to write out 
numbers have become ingrained in 
me at the copy desk — I don’t look it 
up, I just fix it.

Individuality, forward thinking 

and creativity are all characteris-
tics I found in the RC that I valued 
highly before college. By purpose-
fully putting myself in a setting 
where those traits became part of 
my filter, I’ve been able to strength-
en them. In turn, being aware of 
the way they’ve affected me has 
allowed me to challenge and devi-
ate from certain ones. Likewise, 
the Daily uses the AP Style Guide 
as a base, and though we revere it, 
it’s been necessary to make certain 
changes and additions to fit our 
own Stylebook. We have different 
guides, specific to the University of 
Michigan setting, playing into the 
equation.

The importance of realizing the 

guidelines we choose for ourselves 
is not a new idea, and neither is the 
importance of finding ourselves 
within them. But they’re both ideas 
I tend to forget. When I think about 
why I present and filter myself 
the way I do, I remember to make 
adjustments, to pick and choose 
for my own style guide instead of 
completely adapting to another. So 
think about it. What makes up your 
Stylebook?

ometimes I call myself a “sonic 
youth.” It’s become a bit of a pet 
name this first month of school — a 

pep name, if you will — that reminds me 
I am still a crisp young gun, traipsing the 
sunny streets of Ann Arbor with as much 
musicality as possible. But also, I’ve been 
into Sonic Youth lately.

Teenage Riot – Sonic Youth

“Yeah, you’re it,” Kim Gordon begins 

the song whispering, in that weird I’m-
Kermit-the-Frog-but-also-your-fantasy 
tone of voice — hers, and only hers. And 
somehow, I can’t help but believe her; I 
could be walking down the street, feel-
ing the farthest thing from “it,” yet she 
always reassures me that I am. A sonic 
youth, full of vitae and a healthy bal-
ance of useful and useless knowledge, I 
am. Gordon doesn’t know any of this, of 
course, but if she did I’d like to think she’d 
approve and start a teenage riot with me. 
 

Bulls on Parade – Rage Against The 

Machine

At my core, in the teeny tiny crevice of 

my heart noir, I’ve always been in love 
with rock music. Ever since I learned to 
listen, I’ve had this insatiable craving for 
it, two ears that perk up like an eager Ger-
man Shepard’s at the slightest strum of a 
Fender. Many humans, like Gordon, don’t 
know this about me — I have a generally 
perky demeanor, so when I glow up at the 
mention of Rage Against the Machine in 
public, forced smiles of latent confusion 

tend to manifest.

What Ever Happened? – The Strokes

But I listen on, as I always have. In 

psychology, there’s this thing called a 
flashbulb memory: a moment from the 
storage bin of your life you remember 
in sharp detail — the smells, the sounds, 
what you did, what you said. The only 
flashbulb memory I can summon involves 
tiny Melina nuzzled on her black leather 
living room couch circa 2006, watching 
“Marie Antoinette” for the first time and 
hearing The Strokes’ “What Ever Hap-
pened?” play during a pivotal scene. I felt 
instantly more alive when Julian Casa-
blancas wailed, when the guitar pounced 
forward. “This is everything my ears 
have been looking for” is the feeling I had. 
“This is what I like.”

Some Girls – The Rolling Stones

I still feel like this when I listen to 

any kind of rock. Almost love-struck, 
I feel in-tune to my surroundings and 
myself simultaneously. All of my senses 
are heightened by that harmony, and my 
mental state is mollified — where some 
girls need a kiss, I need Mick Jagger tell-
ing me I’m under his thumb. Alas, at the 
risk of veering into un-punk, Parmesan 
cheese territory: I feel ready to take on 
the world when I’m plugged in, no matter 
the circumstance.

And invincibility is a hell of a drug. 

Lately — with new classes, work, 5,000 
readings, the nagging thought of the 

future and the puzzles of the past nipping 
at my heels — I have needed a dose of it. 
Rock injects me. It reminds me that I can 
do it. I don’t need yoga (well, maybe) and 
I don’t need to whine about it. Instead, I 
can listen to the great musical trailblazers 
of yesteryear whine about it and squash 
my own silly fears along the way. That’s 
what a sonic youth would do.

So, lately, when I step out of my apart-

ment building every morning, I’ve got the 
Misfits crawling into my eardrums. The 
fresh air is always a little jarring, and the 
door is always a little harder to push open 
than anticipated, but I’ll be OK. Hell, I’ll 
thrive.

Because “I ain’t no goddamn son of a 

bitch. You better think about it, baby.”

ressed in a black cap and gown, walking 
across a stage in front of thousands of 

their colleagues with a sash over their heads 
and diplomas in their hands — people dream of 
their college graduation from the days of their 
youth. It is a day held in the highest esteem. 
The ensuing party, full of thoughtful gifts and 
congratulatory gestures, is often also antici-
pated — but while being the subject of praise 
and adoration for a day is nice, the reason grad-
uating from college is such a momentous and 
meaningful occasion is much more layered.

Society hails the importance of a college 

education as a ticket to upward mobility and 
a new kind of necessity for a prosperous life. 
Since the turn of the century, college enroll-
ment has risen dramatically, as high school 
diplomas and, more recently, even bachelor’s 
degrees, have lost their clout. A college degree 
has become almost an assumption, a taken-for-
granted symbol of accomplishment, because 
contemporary culture claims that everyone 
should — and does — attend college and earn 
one. But that viewpoint fails to include an 
important, and significantly rising, segment of 
the population.

Nontraditional students, often defined as 

adult students over the age of 25, have taken 
over college campuses yet are still overshad-
owed by their more typically aged counter-
parts. According to the National Center of 
Education Statistics, 38 percent of the 18 mil-
lion students enrolled in college in 2007 were 
classified as nontraditional. However, despite 
their growing presence in the classroom, non-
traditional students across the higher edu-
cation landscape lead largely invisible lives. 
Often overlooked by college administrators 
and fellow students alike, nontraditional stu-
dents tend to be lost in a sea of youth.

Helen Maynard graduated from the Univer-

sity of Michigan this past April, but she wasn’t 
part of the incoming freshman class in the fall 
of 2012. When Maynard took her first steps on 
campus, the year was 1983.

A Cleveland native, Maynard faced finan-

cial troubles from the outset, as out-of-state 
tuition costs roughly double that of in-state 
tuition, and they didn’t subside as time went 
on. By the time her senior year rolled around, 
she worked three jobs simultaneously — an 
ice cream parlor, a retail clothing store and 
the campus recreational sports department — 
and held an unpaid internship position at the 
Community Television Network, the local TV 
station in Ann Arbor. As could be expected, 
Maynard struggled to handle the balancing 
act, eventually burning out and being placed 
on academic probation. The chips were heav-
ily stacked against her, but then, seemingly out 
of nowhere, a production opportunity that paid 
reasonably well came up and she had to make 
a decision. So, a few credits shy of graduating, 
Maynard dropped out.

Time passed, but still facing an uphill climb 

to pay back her student debt, Maynard decided 
to move back to Ohio and put her retail back-
ground to use while attempting to catch the 
attention of local TV crews. One day, on her 
way home from work, one of the videographers 
she knew from the local ABC station was pass-
ing by in a truck. When he saw her, he yelled 
out the window, telling her to call the head of 
the station. They had an opening on the desk. 
With a salary and benefits, she thought she 
would be able to pay off her debts and finally 
go back to school.

But then her professional life took off, and 

those plans had to be put on hold. After moving 
up the ladder with promotion after promotion, 
working her way from producer to assignment 
editor to assignment manager, Maynard began 
to realize that the idea of finishing her degree 
had faded away.

“You stop thinking about it,” she said. “And 

it’s just not on your mind anymore.”

When Maynard did finally return to the Uni-

versity in 2014, it wasn’t as a student. She came 
because she had been selected for a Knight-
Wallace Fellowship, a program for mid-career 
journalists to complete a self-directed program 
of study, participate in professional workshops 
and travel abroad within a single academic 
year. It was that experience that brought the 

didn’t even exist. Even desktop computers 
were a rarity. To access the Internet, students 
had to wait in line at the Michigan Union to 
use the small computer lab in the basement. 
Now, there are computer labs in most aca-
demic buildings on campus. But they often sit 
untouched, as students nowadays often prefer 
to use their laptops in their dorm rooms.

For Maynard, the power to choose the life 

you want to lead is a sentiment she’s found 
common among her younger peers, and it’s one 
that resonates with her. She hasn’t always had 
the choice to determine how her life would pan 
out, so she understands its value. But she did 
decide to come back to the University and fin-
ish her degree, and it’s a choice that has paid 
off.

“I didn’t realize that there was a hole,” she 

said. “It gives me a new confidence to say, ‘OK, 
I don’t have to figure out an answer to that 
question if it comes up.’ It gives me pride to say 
I’m a graduate of the University of Michigan. 
It’s like hitting a giant reset button. I have the 
same issue as everyone else who graduated 
this year: ‘What am I going to do with the rest 
of my life?’ I’ve got a lot of life left.”

Leslie Barroso graduated from Eastern 

Michigan University with a bachelor’s degree 
in English literature and a minor in sociology 
when she was in her late twenties. Though 
she was on track to graduate in four years, she 
dropped out of college during her senior year 
to join her family’s insurance business. But 
after an experience filled with more lows than 
highs, Barroso decided to switch course.

After she earned her degree, she bypassed 

the workforce and chose to start a family 
instead. She got married and moved to a small 
island in Maine, where she spent the majority 
of her adult life raising her children as a stay-
at-home mom. It wasn’t until three years ago 
that Barroso returned to Ann Arbor, but col-
lege wasn’t part of her plans initially.

She had always considered continuing her 

education and earning a master’s degree, but 
since she could never figure out what to study, 
the idea fizzled out. Living in Ann Arbor again, 
the allure of the University was hard to resist. 
So, fate stepped in.

Volunteer work has always been important 

to Barroso, and moving to a new place didn’t 
stop her from getting involved in the commu-
nity. She spends a considerable amount of time 
at the Women’s Huron Valley Correctional 
Facility, and she also works with young women 
in recovery to help ease their troubles. Then, 

she met a few social workers in 
her circle of acquaintances, 
and that’s when it hit her. 
She wanted to pursue a 
master’s degree in social work.

So she enrolled in the School 

of Social Work in the fall of 2016, 
which means she is only two 
weeks into her 16-month long pro-
gram; however, she is already learning how to 
navigate the classroom environment.

In one of her classes a few nights ago, the 

professor told the class to partner up on their 
own, and she had a sense that she would be the 
odd one out because of her older age.

“I just knew I was going to let everyone 

else pair off and I would take who was left 
because nobody flocked over to me,” she said. 
“And I didn’t take it personally. I understood 
it. They’re forming friendships in their own 
group.”

While it might seem like it would be hard for 

her to find a sense of belonging, Barroso says 
that it’s quite the opposite. Her email inbox 
is loaded with offers to join various student 
groups and attend certain organized activities. 
But she has openly chosen to opt out of those 
opportunities — a choice frequently made by 
nontraditional students — because she simply 
doesn’t have enough time in the day.

“To be honest, I don’t expect to find a sense 

of community here,” she said. “I have such a 
busy and full life outside of this — and I put a 
lot of that on hold to go to school. I really need 
the information they can teach me, so that I 
can do what I want to do afterwards.”

Barroso wants to work for an agency as a 

therapist in direct practice, hopefully at the 
University Health System, while also develop-
ing a private practice on the Internet to pro-
vide herself with more flexibility. While it may 
have taken her a while to figure out the next 
phase of her career and life, she said she knows 
now that it has all worked out for the best.

“You only get one lifetime, so it took me this 

long but, oh well,” she said. “All these things 
converged to say, ‘This is what you want to 
do,’ and I think I made the right decision. I 
do have those feelings that I wish I had done 
it 10, 20 years ago, but not much further than 
that because I really loved the life that I lived 
between then and now. I’ve been really lucky.”

Brittney Williams also graduated from the 

University this past April, but her road back to 
college was considerably shorter than those of 
many nontraditional students. She left origi-

nally during her junior year after her 
mother was diagnosed with early onset 

Alzheimer’s disease, and she had to go 
home to Alabama to serve as her mother’s 
primary caretaker and help take care of 

her younger siblings.
She came back five years later, in the sum-

mer of 2015, to pursue a bachelor’s degree in 
sociology, along with minors in Afroamerican 
and African studies and community action 
and social change through the School of Social 
Work, where she is now a master’s student.

Though Williams was in her late twenties 

by the time of her return, her undergraduate 
classmates seemingly couldn’t tell the differ-
ence. She said until she actually disclosed her 
age, many people just figured she was a fifth 
or sixth year senior. But they responded well 
when they did eventually find out the truth.

“I think that people looked at me in a class 

mom sort of way, and so they were like, ‘You’re 
so wise,’ ‘You’ve experienced so much life,’ 
and I kind of embraced that,” she said. “And so 
much of my nature, because of my caregiving 
experience, is about loving on people and mak-
ing them feel supported, so it was fine with 
me.”

While Williams felt accepted by her fellow 

classmates, it wasn’t the same as having people 
who could fully understand her situation. It 
wasn’t until she participated in a focus group 
of nontraditional students at the Center for 
the Education of Women that she felt a sense 
of comfort.

The experience made her openly wonder if 

there were any student organizations where 
these dialogues about the trials and tribula-
tions of nontraditional students existed. When 
there were none to be found, she resolved to 
take matters into her own hands.

So she founded the Michigan Organiza-

tion of Non-Traditional Students, her self-
described “brainchild,” through the Center for 
Campus Involvement. She convinced the CEW 
to become its sponsor, so it became a sponsored 
student organization, and she served as presi-
dent.

Initially, the organization struggled to find 

its footing and recruit members, for several 
reasons. Williams noted there are many logis-
tical issues that can prevent nontraditional 
students from participating in student groups, 
such as having busy schedules, raising children 
or commuting to class. On top of that, there is 
often a mentality that nontraditional students 
are supposed to focus solely on academics, not 
engage in social activities.

To combat these issues and get the organi-

zation off the ground, Williams reached out 

to the CEW for help. Together, they shifted 
the mission from a social gathering place to 
an educational resource center, implement-
ing workshops about dealing with being the 
same age as the professor, doing group work 
with younger peers and finding resources that 
aren’t as socially accessible to them, and they 
resonated strongly with many nontraditional 
students.

As an example of how the group helps con-

nect nontraditional students, Williams said if 
UM’s Counseling and Psychological Services 
utilized social media as a key outreach strat-
egy to connect to the digital generation, a 
nontraditional student in his or her late fifties 
would have a much less active presence online, 
if at all. Therefore, an older student would have 
less access to resources and support from the 
administration, a fundamental problem Wil-
liams noticed across the college landscape.

“How you think about age is that at certain 

points in life you have different levels of self-
sufficiency,” she said. “I think half of it is mak-
ing assumptions about what people know and 
what people need who are older students and 
half of it is about not wanting to come off as 
condescending.”

While Williams has since stepped down as 

president to concentrate on life as a graduate 
student, MONTS will continue to carry on its 
mission to create a safe space for nontradition-

It’s great.”

Oftentimes, when we talk about college, we 

see something specific — the typical experi-
ence of someone 18-24, navigating their first 
years away from home. But for a growing num-
ber of non-traditional students on campuses, 
that isn’t the case. Though they take the road 
less traveled, they reach the same ultimate 
destination, and if these three women are any 
indication, the journey is worth the wait.

idea of earning her degree back to the forefront 
of her mind.

“I hadn’t thought about it in years, and being 

here on campus made me think about it again,” 
she said. “I was so struck by all the great work 
that young people were doing and the enthusi-
asm and that feeling of you can go do anything 
and there’s every opportunity, and I had lost 
some of that.

“It’s an amazing environment being on cam-

pus, the amount of energy that you have, the 
variety of viewpoints, this unlimited opportu-
nity to learn. It just re-kindled something.”

So Maynard reached out to the Center for 

the Education of Women, a University orga-
nization that provides various services and 
financial support to women and nontradition-
al students in an effort to empower them to 
achieve educational success and degree com-
pletion. After applying and sharing her story 
with them, Maynard earned a spot as a CEW 
Scholar. It was that scholarship that enabled 
her to enroll as a student again for the 2015-
2016 academic year.

Through fellowship events and professional 

workshops held by the CEW, Maynard found a 
community of contemporaries that could relate 
to her experience as a nontraditional student 
and its inherent challenges. While some of 
her coworkers were amused or confused by 
her decision to return to school in her early 
fifties, her colleagues in the CEW understood 
her reasoning and encouraged her to carry on. 
She knew it was the right decision for her, and 
their support eased her transition back into the 
world of academia.

The University she found upon her arrival 

was starkly different than the one she left 
three decades ago. The technological revolu-
tion at the turn of the century, for example, 
made it harder for her to keep up with her 
technically-skilled classmates who had grown 
up in the digital age.

On her first day, she showed up to class 

without her laptop because she had read a 
CTools notification the night before from the 
professor that told the class not to bring them. 
But when she looked around the room, all of 
the other students had their laptops out. As it 
turned out, the professor had told them not to 
bring them, except on the first day in order to 
complete an online assessment.

“(Before) if you didn’t know by the end of the 

day or the class, you weren’t going to find out,” 
Maynard said. “No one was calling your dorm 
(saying) they wanted you to read X instead of 
Y. Now I’m getting emails and notifications on 
CTools at 11 o’clock at night.”

When she started school at UM, laptops 


M

y parents both graduated from the University of 
Michigan in 1990. My dad was an outside line-
backer on the varsity football team in 1988, under 

legendary coach Bo Schembechler. My mom choreographed 
multiple productions each year for the School of Music, The-
atre & Dance. They can both share anecdotes about working 
multiple jobs on campus and being involved in clubs. Each of 
them went on to complete master’s programs. They met in 
class — the jock fell in love with the bookish girl who never 
went to a single football game. Yes, I know: It’s unbearably 
cheesy.

Their daughter, on the other hand, is from upstate New 

York. From the age of 8 all the way until my senior year of 
high school, I only considered attending a university that 
boasted a Division I women’s hockey program. The Uni-
versity, sadly, does not offer that particular varsity sport 
(though it would undoubtedly help to grow women’s hockey 
in Michigan if it did).

The vague dream I had of being a Wolverine faded during 

my freshman year of 
high school when I 
found out the school 
didn’t meet my one 
requirement: Divi-
sion 
I 
women’s 

hockey. 
Despite 

being raised by two 
enthusiastic 
Uni-

versity graduates, I 
had only visited Ann 
Arbor once or twice, 
so this news was not 
exactly crushing.

As I entered my 

senior year I was 
being recruited for 
hockey 
by 
some 

decently 
well-

known 
academic 

schools, but in the 
end I was lured 
by low tuition and 
promises of winning 
a 
national 
cham-

pionship. 
SUNY 

Plattsburgh, a Divi-
sion III school locat-
ed somewhere in 
the northernmost corner of New York, is known for having 
strong hockey teams and a decent childhood education pro-
gram. I was not there to become a teacher, so my program of 
choice — entrepreneurship — was not particularly challeng-
ing. I tested out of my foreign language requirement despite 
not taking a language my senior year and barely being able 
to hold a basic conversation in French. I put minimal effort 
into my 100-level calculus class and did fairly well, even 
though my efforts in high school pre-calculus class had been 
far less successful. School-wise, my classmates thought they 
were being challenged, but no one spent long nights at the 
library or Sunday afternoons cramming in a coffee shop. 
In my management class, I was one of the few people that 
turned in homework. My professor told me, “Don’t bother 
showing up to the final, you already have an A.”

So, college hockey was my focus. The daily grueling prac-

tices, led by a coach whose only goal was winning, felt less 
and less worthwhile. Eventually, we won the NCAA Nation-

al Championship, crushing our opposition 9-2 in the final 
game of the tournament. Almost every game of the year had 
been a blowout. We won 6-0, 8-0, 10-1 … our season became 
boring and predictable, exactly the opposite of what college 
hockey should be. Winning nationals left me uneasy, in the 
same way the perfect score in my management class left me 
feeling like I had cheated. I hadn’t earned anything and was 
being rewarded just for meeting expectations, not for tak-
ing initiative or pushing myself. It was becoming clear that 
Plattsburgh was not my home.

It took a broken back to veer my path toward Michigan. I 

left Plattsburgh after one year, clinging to my sport. I moved 
to Cambridge, Ontario, and played junior hockey there for 
half a year. In November, my skates were swept out from 
under me and my neck was snapped backwards onto cold, 
solid ice. The cheap shot behind the referee left me with 
multiple herniated discs, and six months later I went in for 
surgery.

By the time I went to the hospital to have them remove 

ruptured disc material from my spinal cord, I had been 
through four different sets of very painful and unsuccessful 
injections. I had switched doctors, convinced that the first 
hadn’t given me the best medications or treatment options 
available. I was taking too many painkillers each day, ter-
rified of becoming addicted, but not being able to function 
without them. Pain had become a way of life. A risky sur-
gery could fix me, but it would cost me my hockey career. 
Hockey player was the only identity I had left, and without 
it I didn’t know who I was.

I had never considered attending a school where I 

wouldn’t be a varsity athlete, clad in school colors and sur-
rounded by teammates. My recovery prognosis had all along 
been hazy at best. My mother urged me to apply to other 
schools besides the ones I’d visited for hockey. Michigan 
was on the list, but, to me, it still was a fallback. I’d never 
even been on an official campus visit.

Before I go any further, there’s one thing that I feel I have 

to clarify to Michiganders. People in New York do not care 
about college football as much as Midwesterners. In CBS 
Sports’ college football rankings from this week, they list 
our state’s largest Division I schools — Syracuse University 
and the University at Buffalo — at 113 and 121 respectively, 
out of 128 total teams. Michigan is currently number four 
on that list. Football is a huge reason that the University of 
Michigan is known as a great school nationally, but when 
your home state schools typically perform dismally, you try 
to avoid the rankings. Because of that, we don’t have the 
same understanding of large state schools that seems to 
be inherent across the rest of the country. To me, Big Ten 
schools just meant wild parties. Before I started research-
ing, my parents’ intense love of the school was the only rea-
son I applied to be a Wolverine.

For months in high school, I panicked about what school 

to attend. After my first college experience, I was even 
more nervous about making the wrong choice. I confided 
in one of my best friends, David, with my enrollment deci-

sion due shortly and a 
looming choice between 
the University and two 
much 
smaller 
liberal 

arts schools. He knows 
me quite well, and his 
advice 
was 
simple. 

“Michigan seems like a 
Maggie school.”

Thank goodness I lis-

tened to him. I started 
attending the University 
in fall 2015. My classes 
are challenging, but I’ve 
never been more excited 
to attend them. My dis-
mal placement test last 
year can confirm that I 
most definitely was not 
qualified to place out 
of French. With some 
help from my advisor, 
I changed my major to 
English and never have 
to struggle through a 
math class again. I took 
up writing about sports 
for The Michigan Daily 
— something I never 

would’ve had time for as an athlete. I found a new identity 
here. If this is starting to sound like an ad for attending the 
University, I’m sorry: I’m also a tour guide these days. I’m 
not on the football team like dear ol’ dad, but I just accepted 
a job at the Natural History Museum — my mom’s former 
employer. I even won an intramural soccer championship 
last fall, venturing into post-surgery athletics. Sometimes 
the balancing act of a heavy class load and extracurriculars 
gets tough, as it does for every student. Looking back helps 
me to realize how lucky I am to attend the best university in 
the world, even if it took me a while to get here.

All Roads Lead to Ann Arbor

H

e’ll be born in March. March is undoubtedly 
the best month for him to be born, because he 
can still be included in the elementary school 

calendar of class birthdays, he’ll share an astrological 
sign with Kurt Cobain and he’ll be mentioned in the 
same breath as both a lion and a lamb.

His ears will be of equal size, rather than uneven 

and with a single, pointed side. This will help with 
his insecurity, but mostly avoid the cognitive disso-
nance of, as a Jew, being asked incessantly if he knows 
Santa Claus. Because, yes, a pointed ear must mean 
he is an elf. And OK, sure, he’ll tell Santa you want a 
Nintendo DS.

His voice will drop early, so he won’t 

sound like Timmy Turner while the 
rest of his friends sound somewhere 
between Thom Yorke and Ghost-
face Killah. He won’t be asked 
tirelessly where his Fairly Odd-
parents are, or his pink hat, 
or his pink shirt. He doesn’t 
even like pink.

He’ll decide that if he 

really isn’t into this girl 
in his math class, he 
really shouldn’t date 
this girl in his math 
class. 
Screw 
the 

homecoming 
dance 

and its 1950s need 
for fertile couplets. 
This will allow him 
to avoid the uncom-
fortable 
hand-hold-

ing 
and 
awkward 

teeth kissing in the 
basement of her par-
ents’ home. And then 
he won’t have to break 
up with her in the hall-
way before math class. 
Because then she will cry 
over integral functions and 
her friends will, rightly, hate 
him.

He’ll turn off the volume 

on his computer the first time 
he visits the silent library. Or else 
Future’s “Freak Hoe” will play with 
full vigor thanks to an accidental slip 
of the hand, to his personal horror and 
the room’s collective confusion as to why this 
slight white kid is listening to Future.

He’ll always manage his time and he’ll never be 

late. He’ll know that if class starts at 9 a.m., he should 
not exit the shower at 9:15 a.m. Or 9:30. Or 9:45.

He won’t forget to text his friends for two, three 

months; OK, maybe it was longer. Because he does 
actually care about them — and how in the hell is he 
going to explain the reasons he couldn’t remember? 
Because he really should have remembered, instead 
of being too preoccupied by the way he just said “Hey, 
what’s up?” on the street, or whether this or that per-
son actually likes him or is just pretending, or if he 
shouldn’t have said that thing that he said last Friday, 
or how he ended up in the middle of an intersection 

with his face against a Ford Taurus while thinking 
about it all. And so he will never forget to text his 
friends. And they won’t get upset at him for failing to 
do so, thinking he has better things to do, like run into 
a Ford Taurus.

He’ll decide that any message sent after 2:30 a.m. 

will inevitably lead to regret, in one of its billion jaded 
forms. He will refrain from them altogether.

He’ll be direct. He won’t drag his I-Mean-I-Guess-

We’re-Dating along for a month without contact 
because he’s too afraid to tell her that he wants to end 
it and simply hopes that she will come to the under-
standing on her own, without confrontation. He 
won’t have a tequila-driven argument with her on her 
birthday, denying said strategy, saying “Oh, I was just 
busy.” Because that’s shitty. And he knows it.

He’ll be outgoing at parties. He won’t feel so awk-

ward that he resorts to rereading the most useless 
corners and memes on his small screen until the 

words and the pictures no longer make sense. He 
won’t stand around, assuming it’s the world’s job to 
make him friends, not his own. He won’t then walk 
out unannounced, so everyone thinks he died or, 
worse, threw up in someone’s bathroom. 

He won’t like boys. Like boys in the way he thought 

— he was told — he should only like girls. It will be 
clearer, simple, easy: perfect. He can avoid having to, 
when the subject is reached, laugh nervously and say 
something inconsequential about last Saturday or the 
weather. He can just smile when an ex tells him her 
greatest fear is dating a boy who “turns.” He won’t sit 
on the floor of the shower for hours, holding his head 
because he thinks this is a sentence for solitude for 

the rest of his life — that wastes water. He won’t 

be afraid everyone would think, for God knows 

why, him more Chér than Cuban Linx.

***

He’ll be born in June. June is 
undoubtedly the best month for him 

to be born, for summer is his favor-
ite season anyway, he’ll share an 
astrological sign with Tupac and 
he’ll be mentioned in the same 
breath as Jeeps and the sand.

He won’t wish his ears were 

smaller and rounded because 
they’re different, which is 
good. He’ll know his voice will 
eventually drop and he won’t 
be Timmy Turner forever. 
He’ll see the first girl he royally 
screwed over is with someone 
better. And she’s happy. And so 
is the second. And the others, 
he guesses. And he’ll figure out 
how to turn off the sound on his 
computer and he’ll try his best 
to be punctual and he’ll try even 
harder to remember the people 

who care about him and he prob-

ably won’t stop sending texts after 

2:30 a.m. but damn will he try, and he’ll 

work on introducing himself and asking 

people’s names and remembering people’s 

names and remembering the things they tell 

him, and he won’t fucking wish he wasn’t bent 

because there’s so much other shit that he could 

be worried about and he might be alone forever and 

live with a husky in the mountains of Colorado, but 
he also might not and it might not be what he always 
thought it would be or what he always wanted it to be, 
but he’s getting used to it and he just needs some time 
and damn he can even marry and maybe not even be 
hated and maybe just fucking maybe even be happy. 

And so he won’t care if everyone thinks him more 

Chér than Cuban Linx.

And he wouldn’t change a thing.

This summer, I photographed about 20 or so concerts of everyone from The 1975 to 
Johnny Depp, and yet I don’t think any of them I would consider a favorite among all I have 
seen. Not because the performances were bad, or I wasn’t close enough, but because 
when you photograph a concert, the experience becomes something different. Talking 
with other photographers after a show, no one is talking about the artist. It’s always 
“look at this shot” or “I wish the lighting was different here.” It’s because, to a concert 
photographer, it’s not about the performance, but how the performance will look through 
the viewfinder.
