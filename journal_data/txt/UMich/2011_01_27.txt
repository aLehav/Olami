If city ordinance
passes, medical pot
owner's business
will become illegal
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily StaffReporter
Though the office building at
202 E. Washington St. doesn't
look notable from the outside,
one of its tenants owns abusiness
that is rather controversial.
The business is a medical
marijuana dispensary called the
Ann Arbor Patient to Patient
Compassion Club. The dispensa-
ry's owner T.J. Rice sells several
varieties of marijuana in addition
to other products that contain
cannabis.
Since Michigan voters passed
the Medical Marihuana Act in
November 2008 through a bal-
lot proposal, regulation of medi-
cal marijuana dispensaries has
been a recurring issue at Ann
Arbor City Council meetings.

Currently, the City Council is
in the process of evaluating an
ordinance that would establish
rules for licensing the businesses.
After a first reading of the ordi-
nance was postponed last week,
the City Council will have a first
reading of the ordinance at its
Feb. 7 meeting.
Rice, also a convicted drug
felon, said he possesses marijua-
na for medical reasons. However,
he said he isn't a registered medi-
cal marijuana cardholder with
the state.
The Medical Marihuana Act
doesn't refer to dispensary own-
ers, leaving it up to individual cit-
ies to decide whether a convicted
drug felon should be allowed to
own one. The current draft of the
proposed city ordinance prohib-
its felons from doing so.
Rice, who is a cancer survivor,
said he is in the process of obtain-
ing a card butsees little use in the
identification.
"Cards aren't important at all,"
Rice said.

Students gain
experience through
working at schools
By BRIENNE PRUSAK
Daily StaffReporter
At the beginning of each
semester, Bob Bain, an associ-
ate professor in the University's

School of Education, asks his
students to write letters to their
future selves to remind them
of the teachers they want to be
and the skills they want to uti-
lize. He tells them what they're
learning isn't preparing them for
the moment, but for when they
become teachers in 18 months.
Through new programs and
graduation requirements, the
School of Education is helping

students become the teachers
described in their letters. Five
years ago, the School of Edu-
cation began implementing
new graduation requirements,
including participation in the
Clinical Rounds Project as well
as providing the option to take
part in the Mitchell/Scarlett-
U-M Partnership. The program
requires students studying to
become secondary education

teachers to have classroom
teaching experience in addi-
tion to the education they gain
through classes and textbooks.
According to Bain, students
in the Clinical Rounds Project
are required to work in five dif-
ferent schools, including public,
private, urban and suburban
schools, before graduation. This

Instead of spending their summers
working 9-5 at an internship,
members of United Against
Infectious Diseases willbe travelling
to developing countries to provide
disease testing and counseling to
at-risk individuals.
Founded last semester, the student
organization works in certain areas
of developing nations to combat
diseases like HIV, tuberculosis and
malaria. This summer, the group's 40
members will travel to communities
in South Africa, Panama and Uganda,
among other countries.
LSA junior Eric Stulberg, the
awareness and activism coordinator
for the University's UAID chapter,
said since the campus chapter is
new, members of the group will be
going abroad on trips planned by

other schools. Other universities
with UAID chapters include Brown
University, Princeton University and
Yale University. The University's
group plans to organize its own trips
abroad for summ.er 2012, according
to Stulberg.
On the upcoming trips, the
students will be immersed in rural
environments.
"We'll be staying in or near the
villages and working with local
doctors," he said.
To prepare for their time abroad,
club members will fundraise
throughout the semester. The
group is funded by Global Brigades,
but it also relies on local support.
With the donations, the group will
purchase infectious disease testing
kits that provide cheap, effective

and quick results. UAID was the first
organization to - bring these rapid
tests into Panama, Stulberg said.
In addition to offering the testing
kits, students will provide counseling
based on protocol outlined by the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, according to Rackham
graduate student Sonia Gupta, a
UAID national board member.
"All patients will receive
information about the rapid.test and
give informed consent for testing,
and patients who can benefit will
also receive prevention counseling,"
Gupta wrote in an e-mail interview.
Students will also lead awareness
campaigns before offering any
testing or counseling services in the
areas, Gupta wrote.

East Coast hit wit

Schools close en
masse throughout
the Northeast
NEW YORK (AP) - Schools
closed, governments sent work-
ers home early and planes were
grounded yesterday in an all-too-
familiar routine along the East
Coast as another snowstormswept
over a region already beaten down
by a winter not even half over.
"I fell three times trying to get
off the steps," commuter Elliott
Self said after leaving an elevated
train in Philadelphia. "I just want
the snow to stop. I want the sun
again. I want to feel just a little bit
of warmth."
Millions of people got that oh-
no-not-again feeling as the wet
and sloppy storm engulfed the
Northeast, where snowbanks in
some places were already so high
that drivers couldn't see around
corners.
Classes were called off and

commutes were snarled from
Tennessee to New England as
cars and buses slipped and slid on
highways. The New York area's
airports, among the nation's busi-
est, saw hundreds of delayed or
canceled flights. Pedestrians
struggled across icy patches that
were on their way to becoming
deep drifts.
In Pennsylvania, residents
hunkered down as a one-two
punch of a winter storm brought
snow, sleet and then more snow,
which forecasters said could total
a foot in some areas. Philadelphia
declared a snow emergency as of
yesterday evening, ordering cars
removed from emergency routes.
Northwest, in Hatfield Town-
ship, Pa., residents were scared
by thunder claps and blinding
lightning in a rare thundersnow,
a thunderstorm with heavy snow
instead of rain.
Eight to 12 inches of snow
was forecast for New York City,
which had already seen 36 inches
of snow this season in compari-

son with the full-winter average
of 21 inches. New Jersey also was
looking at up to a foot of snow,
and high winds were expected
before the storm moves out early
today.
Rain drenched the nation's
capital for most of the day and
changed to sleet before it started
snowing in earnest at midafter-
noon. Washington was expected
to get up to 10 inches of snow.
The snow and icy roads created
hazardous conditions for Presi-
dent Barack Obama as he returned
to the White House yesterday
after a post-State of the Union
trip to Manitowoc, Wis. The win-
try weather grounded Marine
One, the helicopter that typically
transports Obama to and from the
military base where Air Force One
lands. Instead, Obama was met at
the plane by his motorcade, which
spent an hour weaving through
rush hour traffic already slowed
by the storm. It normally takes
the president's motorcade about
20 minutes to travel between the
base and the White House.
In suburban Silver Spring, Md.,
Tiffany Horairy, a 43-year-old
nurse, said as she waited for a bus
that she was getting tired of the
constantcpecking of minor or mod-
erate storms.
"I'd rather get something like
last year, with all the snow at
once," she said.
Since Dec. 14, snow has fall-
en eight times on the New York
region - or an average of about
once every five days. That includes
the blizzard that dropped 20 inch-
es on the city and paralyzed travel
after Christmas.
Some places are running out of
room to stash plowed snow.
Portsmouth, N.H., hauls its
snow out to Peirce Island, but it
was nearly full, with a huge moun-
tain of the stuff.
"We probably have a five-sto-
ry snow dump right now," said
Portsmouth public works director
David Allen. "It's time to get a lift
up on it and we could probably do
a ski run."

Fuel leaks reported
in Lexus IS and
sedans in North
America, Japan
TOKYO (AP) - Toyota
recalled nearly 1.7 million cars
worldwide yesterday for possible
fuel leaks, the latest in a balloon-
ing number of quality problems
that could further tarnish the
company's reputation in the Unit-
ed States.
The recalls are mostly in
Japan, but include Lexus IS and
GS luxury sedans sold in North
America. That's where the
world's No. 1 car company faces
the biggest challenges in winning
back customer trust.
U.S. dealers will inspect cars to
see if loose fuel pressure sensors
caused leaks. There were no acci-
dents suspected of being caused
by those problems, according
to Toyota. The car maker has
received 77 complaints overseas,
75 of them in North America, and
more than 140 in Japan.
The latest quality hitch fol-
lows a spate of recalls that began
in late 2009, mostly in North
A

America, which now cover more
than 12 million cars and trucks.
The recalls involve defective
floor mats and gas pedals thatget
stuck, some of them suspected of
causing unintended acceleration.
Yesterday's recalls come
exactly one year after Toyota
stopped selling eight models in
the U.S. because of unintended
acceleration problems. The sales
suspension affected 60 percent
of Toyota's lineup in the U.S., and
was the first of four sales halts
last year.
Koji Endo, auto analyst with
Advanced Research Japan Co.
in Tokyo, said the newest recalls
will cost Toyota about 20 billion
yen ($240 million), but won't hurt
its earnings much.
"But there is that perception of
here we go again, and that hurts
Toyota's image, especially in
North America," he said.
The biggest damage to Toy-
ota's image has been in the U.S.
where its response to safety prob-
lems was seen as slow. The com-
pany's U.S. sales lagged last year
despite an industry recovery.
Some believe that Toyota's relent-
less drive for growth hurt quality.
The company has lost some
potential U.S. customers: A sur-

vey done by consumer website
Edmunds.com showed that 17.9
percent of all car shoppers last
month were considering a Toyo-
ta, a 3.8 percent point drop from a
year earlier. That drop in consid-
eration could be blamed on Toy-
ota's recalls, as well as its aging
lineup.
"Toyota needs to overcome not
just the PR damage sustained by
last year's recalls, but also the
reality that many of its models
are stale," said Jessica Caldwell,
director of pricing and industry
analysis for Edmunds.
Toyota has stayed popular
in Japan, partly because gov-
ernment incentives for green
vehicles sent sales of itsPrius gas-
oline-electric hybrid booming.
The company is likely trying
to be aggressive with recalls and
so the latest one is not a sign that
quality is taking another dive at
the company, Endo said.
To help respond to customer
complaints and investigate qual-
ity concerns quickly, the compa-
ny recently opened two new field
offices, in Houston and Jackson-
ville, Fla. It plans to open another
in Denver by the end of the first
quarter, and already has offices in
New York and San Francisco.

Nonprofit plans to
expand schools'
energy efficiency
An Ann Arbor-based nonprof-
it technical resource center says
it's expanding the energy effi-
ciency of Michigan schools by
installing solar and wind power
generation systems at 90 institu-
tions during the next three years.
Energy Works Michigan said
Thursday that the expansion of
its Michigan Renewable Schools
Program is made possible by a
$4.4 million contract with the
Michigan Public Service Com-
mission.
The program already has
helped install 30 renewable
energy systems in 24 school dis-
tricts in 2009 and 2010. Forty
more districts received energy
audits and technical assistance
in taking actions to cut costs and
increase energy efficiency.

Obama: U.S. needs
to spend more on
innovations
President Barack Obama
campaigned vigorously for his
a revamped economic message
yesterday, warning that other
countries have been grasping for
first place in the global market-
place as the U.S. fell down on the
job.
The president delivered the
argument in Wisconsin, a state
that will be critical to his re-
election prospects, a day after a
State of the Union address where
he contended that the U.S. has to
step up its spending on innova-
tion and infrastructure in order
to compete globally and create
jobs at home.
The president said yesterday
that while China invested in
clean energy technologies, "we
fell down on the job. We weren't
moving as fast as we should
have."

A' resident remains
the last missing
soldier in Iraq
The U.S. soldier was out of
uniform when he sneaked off
base on a motorcycle to visit his
Iraqi wife in central Baghdad.
The militiamen hiding nearby
weren't fooled. They were seen
seizing him at gunpoint.
More than four years later,
Ahmed Kousay al-Taie, a resi-
dent of Ann Arbor, Michigan
who was born in Iraq, is the only
American service member still
missing here. His family fears he
will never be found.
Kidnappings of foreigners
and Iraqis for ransom or politi-
cal motives were common as the
insurgency gained steam after
the 2003 U.S-led invasion. The
February 2006 bombing of a Shi-

ite mosque by Sunni insurgents
caused retaliatory bloodshed to
spiral.

Health officials are looking

determine if the patients in Port-
de-Paix were sickened by polio.
Local health authorities
reported suspected cases on Jan.
10. Of four showing paralysis
three died and one is hospital-
ized in the capital.
Officials from the Pan Ameri-
can Health Organization, Haiti's

the cause.

Report shows federal
funds used to send
officials to districts
of GOP candidates
WASHINGTON (AP) - In
the run-up to the 2006 midterm
election in which Republicans
lost control of the House, the
Bush administration repeatedly
broke the law by using federal
funds to send Cabinet secretar-
ies and other high-level political
appointees to congressional dis-
tricts of GOP candidates in tight
races, according to a government
report.
"Because those trips were
classified as official, funds from
the U.S. Treasury were used to
finance the trips and reimburse-
ment from the relevant cam-
paigns was never sought," stated

the report by the Office of Special
Counsel, an independent federal
agency that enforces Hatch Act
restrictions on partisan political
activity inside the federal govern-
ment.
"In other cases, even when
trips were correctly designated as
political, agencies used U.S. Trea-
sury funds to cover the costs asso-
ciated with the trips and did not
recoup those funds as required
by the Hatch Act and its regula-
tions," the office concluded.
OSC found that 10 agencies
used federal funds to pay for
political appointees to travel to
events supporting Republican
candidates in 2006 in an opera-
tion monitored closely by the
White House Office of Politi-
cal Affairs. The report says that
aspects of OPA that came in con-
flict with the Hatch Act during
the Bush era "have apparently
existed for decades."

rage against President Hosni
Mubarak's autocratic govern-
ment in a second day of protests
yesterday that defied a ban on
public gatherings. Baton-wield-
ing police responded with tear
gas and beatings in a crack-
down that showed zero toler-
ance for dissent.
Egypt's largest anti-govern-
ment protests in years echoed
the uprising in Tunisia, threat-
ening to destabilize the leader-
ship of the most important U.S.
ally in the Arab world. The abil-
ity of the protesters to sustain
the momentum for two days in
the face of such a heavy-handed
police response was a rare feat
in this country.
One protester and a police-
man were killed yesterday,
bringing the two-day death toll
to six. Some 860 people have
been rounded up, and Face-
book, Twitter and cell phones
- key to organizing protests -
have been disrupted.
Secretary of State Hillary
Rodham Clinton called on
Egypt to adopt broad reforms
and not crack down on the anti-
government crowds. She urged
the Mubarak regime to "take
this opportunity to implement
political, economic and social
reforms that will answer the
legitimate interests of the
Egyptian people."
Still, there was no indication
that Mubarak, who has ruled
with an iron fist for nearly 30
years, intends to relinquish

power or make democratic or
economic concessions, and no
sign he would rein in his secu-
rity forces.
The defiant demonstrations
continued late into the night. In
Cairo, dozens of riotpolice with
helmets and shields charged
more than 2,000 marchers on
a downtown boulevard along
the Nile. Smaller clashes broke
out across the capital. In one,
protesters stoned police, who
responded with a volley of tear
gas from a bridge over the Nile.
One protester, businessman
Said Abdel-Motalib, called the
civil unrest "a red light to the
regime. This is a warning."
In cities across Egypt, pro-
testers incensed by Egypt's
grinding poverty, rising prices
and high unemployment hurled
rocks and firebombs at police
and smashed the windows of
military vehicles.
The Interior Ministry
warned yesterday that police
would not tolerate any gather-
ings, and thousands of security
forces were out on the streets
poised to move quickly against
any unrest. Many were plain-
clothes officers whose leather
jackets and casual sweat shirts
allowed them to blend in easily
with protesters.
Thousands of policemen
in riot gear and backed by
armored vehicles also took up
posts in Cairo, onbridges across
the Nile, at major intersections
and squares, as well as outside
key installations, including the
state TV building and the head-
quarters of Mubarak's ruling
National Democratic Party.
Police fired tear gas to
disperse a crowd of sev-
eral hundred activists on a
main thoroughfare, chasing

them through side streets as
both sides pelted each other
with rocks while hundreds
of onlookers watched. Plain-
clothes officers shoved some
into waiting vans, slapping
them in the face.
Observing the clashes,
Omima Maher, a 37-year-old
housewife lamented her money
woes. "Everything is so hor-
rible. I hope we can change it,"
she said.
A policeman and a demon-
strator were killed yesterday
when a car ran them over dur-
ing a protest in a poor central
Cairo neighborhood, security
officials said. Earlier, three
demonstrators died in clashes
in the city of Suez and one
policemen was killed in Cairo
violence.
In Suez, east of Cairo, a
peaceful gathering turned vio-
lent at sunset when protesters
threw rocks ata morgue where
they were waiting for the body
of a man killed a day earlier.
Police broke up the crowd with
tear gas, rubber bullets andlive.
ammunition fired into the air.
Women screamed as they
called their sons home, and men
vomited in the streets from the
acrid white tear gas that filled
the air.
Protesters also firebombed
the ruling party headquarters
and a police station, damaging
both buildings as burning trash
littered the streets.
In the southern city of
Assiut, witnesses said riot
police set upon some 100 activ-
ists, beating them with batons
and arresting nearly half of
them. "Down, down Hosni
Mubarak!" chanted the crowd.
"Oh, people, join us or you will
be next."

Offensive ads of female
bodies could be banned

Italian television
company criticized
for 'vulgar' images
ROME (AP) - The government
of Premier Silvio Berlusconi, who
is involved in a sex scandal many
say fosters a demeaning image of
Italian women, took action yes-
terday against ads that use vulgar
images of the female body.
The initiative drew praise in
a country where scantily-clad
women are used to promote just
about everything. But it also
attracted sarcasm, after wide-
spread reports that parties at a
Berlusconi villa involved scores
of young girls, sometimes topless,
drinking and dancing.
The minister for equal oppor-
tunity, Mara Carfagna, signed a
protocol with an association of
advertisers and other industry
operators to set up a panel that
could ban ads that are "plainly
wrong, dangerous, vulgar and
offensive."
Carfagna, a former showgirl
who once posed for a racy calen-
dar, fended off questions during
a press conference about Berlus-
coni, who is under investigation in
Milan on suspicion he paid for sex
with a 17-year-old Moroccan and
used his officeto coveritup.
The 74-year-old Italian leader

has denied wrongdoing.
Carfagna said she had thought
of postponing the announcement
to a "more serene moment," but
she also defended Berlusconi, say-
ing nothing had been proved and
that it was not her place to pass
"moral judgment."
An opposition politician, Debo-
ra Serracchiani, welcomed the ad
initiative, but also asked Carfagna
if "offering thousands of euros to
have groups of beautiful girls over
for dinner ... shows a healthy rela-
tions with women's bodies."
Morethan2,000Italianwomen
have recently signed an online
petition to promote a different
kind of woman than the one typi-
cally associated withw Berlus-
coni, whose private TV channels
for decades have been filled with
semi-naked, voluptuous girls. The
campaign, entitled "Basta!" or
"Enough?" and coordinated by the
leftist newspaper L'Unita, aims to
tell Berlusconi that not all women
in Italy are prostitutes or show-
girls.
Famiglia Cristiana, an influen-
tial Catholic magazine that is dis-
tributed in parishes across Italy,
said in an editorial Wednesday
that men, too, should feel "out-
raged at the public humiliation
of women." It was the latest criti-
cism from a Catholic publication,
signaling the church's growing
unease over the scandal.

Calif. residents against plans
for construction of mosque

Opponents fear
radicalism, increase
in traffic
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Oppo-
nents of a proposed mosque in
the Southern California city of
Temecula collected hundreds
of signatures, bombarded city
planners with angry letters and
e-mails, and even staged pro-
tests with bullhorns and dogs.
None of it worked.
The City Council approved
plans early yesterday for the
25,000-square-foot, two-story
mosque after a nine-hour meet-
ing that included rants against
Islam as well as technical
debates about traffic concerns
and flood plains.
The Islamic Center of Tem-
ecula Valley is one of several
across the U.S. that has seized
the nation's attention in recent
months as controversy raged
over plans for a $100 million
mosque and educational center
two blocks from the site of the
Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. A
mosque planned in the suburbs
of Nashville, Tenn., has also
sparked a dispute.
The Temecula center has
owned the land for years but
didn't encounter resistance

until planning work on the
mosque coincided with debate
over the New York site, putting
150 Muslim families at the cen-
ter of a bitter fight, said Imam
Mahmoud Harmoush.
Some residents worried the
California mosque would be a
center for radical Islam and add
to traffic woes in the rapidly
developing region. The mosque
spent more than $17,000 in
the past year, which included
studies on the 4.3-acre site to
address code concerns raised
by its opponents, mosque lead-
ers said.
"It's amazing how people
shift their positions and really
don't listen," Harmoush said.
"They say, 'Maybe somewhere
they are mutilating women,
somewhere they are beating
their wives.' If somebody did
something in Jordan or Paki-
stan or Iran, that doesn't mean
American Muslims will do it
here."
Opponents said they would
meet today to discuss whether
to file a legal challenge over a
parking issue.
They insist their protest
is not based on religion but
instead on concerns about
increased traffic on an already
overburdened road, and flood-
ing issues that could impact

the mosque's neighbors - two
Christian churches.
In response, the City Council
modified the construction per-
mit to include traffic reviews
every five years and ban the use
of external speakers that could
be used for calls to prayer.
Those modifications will
be helpful for residents who
will be closely watching the
mosque for problems, said
George Rombach, a member of
Concerned American Citizens,
which was formed to oppose
the mosque.
"Part of the victory last
night was it gave us more tools
to do that - but it's totally un-
American to punish somebody
for something they haven't
done," said Rombach, who said
he was not motivated by reli-
gious bias.
Mano Bakh, an Iranian-
born U.S. citizen who rejected
the Islamic faith of his child-
hood, founded Concerned
American Citizens and said
he remained suspicious of why
so much space was needed to
worship.
"A 25,000-square-foot build-
ing for less than 150 families,
where is the logic? That tells
you something," Bakh said. "It
is in my opinion a center of rad-
icalization."

Illu-minating safety
Education and awareness is vital for protection
While it's no Detroit, it's no secret that Ann Arbor hasn't
exactly felt like the safest place lately. With a recentuptick
in crime, students and parents are concerned about the
safety of those who find themselves walking around Ann Arbor after
dark. Members of the University's Department of Public Safety and
Ann Arbor Police Department have tried to address these issues by
increasing their patrol and holding informational panels. But more
can be done to ensure the well-being of all Ann Arbor residents. The
city of Ann Arbor needs to look into lighting concerns, the University
needs to educate students about safety initiatives and students need
to do their best to protect themselves.

hy do you go to college?
To get a job I presume. I
don't think I'm alone in
saying that since
I arrived on cam-
pus, the majority
of sources have
promoted that
very message.
I've lived with a
Business School
major and Col- JEREMY
lege of Engi- LEVY
neering major
who regularly
applaud themselves for, in their
words, convincing me to transfer
out of LSA. I've also read multiple
Michigan Daily columns in which
English majors have made fun of
themselves and their supposed
future uselessness. In my time here,
I've silently upheld my personal
belief that there is value in an edu-
cation not directed toward a spe-
cific occupation. But it's a difficult
argument for many to buy into.
This column is not about your
major - I support students' deci-
sions to major in nursing, business,
architecture or whatever other
occupational fields of study are out
there. I'm more concerned about
our education system as a whole and
have generally felt that something
very crucial is missing from our job-
centered focus. The evidence for
me to make such an argument has
finally fallen into my lap.
In a new book called "Academi-
cally Adrift: Limited Learning on
College Campuses," New York Uni-
versity sociologist Richard Arum
provides concerning data showing
that many students are not picking
up critical thinkingskills in college.
Such skills are often championed as
the heart of a liberal arts education,
but they have appareotly beentaken
for granted across the educational
spectrum.

Between 2005 and 2009, Arum
tracked more than 2,000 students
from 24 different colleges and
universities. Using the Collegiate
Learning Assessment to evaluate
critical thinking skills, he found
that 45 percent of students showed
no improvement in their first two
years of school, and 36 percent
showed no improvement over four
years. Some of the skills tested by
the CLA include a student's abil-
ity to analyze a series of documents
with contrasting information and to
critique the logic behind a political
argument. While Arum didn't spec-
ify which universitieswere involved
in the study, he assures readers that
they varied widely in selectivity
and even elite universities weren't
exempt from the findings.
There's a persistent mind-
set in today's educational system
that hails job preparation at the
expense of critical thinking. This
study shows that students in tra-
ditional liberal arts concentrations
improved more in critical thinking
than those with a career-specific
major. This finding does not change
the fact that the problem exists
across majors, but does provide evi-
dence that a career-centered focus
is a major factor.
Additionally, in the most wide-
spread report on Arum'sbook, a stu-
dent from DePauw University stated
that critical thinking was "irrel-
evant" for a student who didn't have
a good resumd. The statement may
be true to a degree, but it doesn't
support the magnitude of Arum's
findings. There are a variety of rea-
sons that, on a macro-level, we need
college graduates to think critically.
Many of these reasons relate to
politics. The CLA tests the exact
skills that I would hope an educat-
ed voter rhas-when ,selecting which
political candidates to support. A
more critical citizenrywould beless

susceptible to campaign rhetoric
that is purely political or emotional
and would demand more substan-
tive promises from elected officials.
Additionally, such a base of voters
would be more capable of realisti-
cally gauging what range of policy
options exist on a particular issue.
As political scientist Morris Fiorina
stated regarding the failed Clinton
health care reform bill in 1993, "If
citizens want guaranteed health
care for all, unrestricted choice of
doctors and facilities, and lower
premiums than they currently pay,
they are unlikely to be happy with
any conceivable national health
care plan."
Something is
missing from a
vocational focus.
Politics aside, it seems apparent
that our future leaders and gradu-
ates - be it in their occupations or
elsewhere - will have to make big
decisions with societal implica-
tions, decisions that no subject-spe-
cific education will prepare them
for. There's no telling how our econ-
omy or social structureswill change
in our lifetimes. But we are doing
ourselves a disservice by focusing
on the skills that will help us in the
present circumstances without giv-
ing due weight to the critical think-
ing skills that will allow us to adapt
later on. Arum's study sheds light
on these issues in an unprecedented
way, and his findings shouldn't be
ignored in the upcoming discourse
on education.

With two armed robberies in the past two
months, there's been growing concern about
the overall safety around campus. On Tuesday,
campus leaders met with members of DPS and
AAPD to talk about what's being done to ensure
that proper precautions are taken to protect
students and Ann Arbor residents, accord-
ing to a Jan. 26 Daily article. Also discussed
was the issue of the ill-lit neighborhoods in
the Oxford Housing area that are particularly
prone to crime. At the meeting, Jim Kosteva,
the University's director of community rela-
tions, stressed that new lights would be costly
for the city.
The most important, and obvious, fix for
these areas is to install additional lighting. If
streets near Oxford are better lit throughout
the night, residents will be able to see more
of their surroundings and other pedestrians.
While the moratorium on, additional street
light is "directly financial," according to Koste-
va, the city should figure out how to produce
the money. And charging individuals in the
area for additional lighting isn't an appropriate
option. Safety isn't a service for residents, it's a
necessity.
With students' presence on campus con-

stantly fluctuating, it's difficult for them to be
aware of all of the specifics of Ann Arbor. But
it's crucial that students - especially incoming
freshmen - are informed of safety concerns
and protocol on campus. They need to be edu-
cated about what resources are at their dispos-
al and how to respond to emergency situations.
This information is available on the Univer-
sity website. But in light of the recent string
of crimes, the University should e-mail safety
information to students and post information
in all academic buildings.
While it's important that students are made
aware of how to ensure their personal safety,
it's equally necessary that they take precau-
tions to protect themselves. All students should
use ride services at night, be cautious when
walking in ill-lit areas and trust their instincts
by seeking help when they need it. It may seem
tedious to students to adhere to every safety
precaution, but it's irresponsible to not use the
free or inexpensive resources at their disposal.
Crime is an unfortunate reality, but it
shouldn't stop students from going about their
lives. With increased education and awareness,
students will be able to ensure their personal
safety.

Over the past month, students have
expressed growing concern regarding recent
crimes in the Oxford Housing area. With two
armed robberies since early December, we
recognize that something must be done to
improve safety at the University. As chair and
vicechair of the Michigan Student Assembly
Student Safety Commission, we aim to inform
students of what measures have already been
taken to prevent future incidents from occur-
ring and to help students get involved in their
own personal safety.
Since the start ofthis semester, we've sought
meetings with administrative leaders respon-
sible for student affairs and law enforcement
in the University area. Through these con-
versations, we've learned that preliminary
actions have been taken by the Department of
Public Safety, Ann Arbor Police Department
and Housing Security to deter future crime.
According to DPS Public Spokeswoman
Diane Brown, DPS and AAPD "have been pro-
viding targeted police patrols of the area as
well as surveillance efforts." University Hous-
inghas also extended Oxford dininghours and
has stationed an additional security officer at
Oxford Housing from 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. each day.
To facilitate safer student travel on the week-
ends, Parking and Transportation Services
has temporarily extended Oxford bus service
from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Saturdays and Sun-
days.
While these efforts take important steps
toward improving safety at the University,
there are also measures that students should
personally consider when traveling alone or at
night. As a start, use the buddy system - try
to walk in groups of three or more, especially
after dark - and stay on well-traveled, well-
lit paths, even if they don't provide the most
direct route to your destination. It's also criti-
cal to remain aware of your surroundings at
all times. Attackers are looking for distracted
individuals, so think twice before texting,
talking on your phone or listening to music as
you walk home. Finally, be sure to call a friend
before you leave so that someone knows when
to expect your arrival, and never hesitate to
call the police if you feel unsafe or observe
suspicious behavior.
As an alternative to walking, PTS and AATA

provide a number of free or low-cost taxi ser-
vices that are available to students throughout
the night. S.A.F.E. WALK (734-763-9255) is a
free ride-home program that transports stu-
dents from anywhere on campus to a nearby
off-campus location between the hours of 10
p.m. and 3 a.m. Ride Home (734-547-9800)
is another free transportation resource that
takes students from the UGLi, the Duderstadt
Center or the Cancer Center on the Medical
Campus to their residences between the hours
of 2 a.m. and 7 a.m. Night Ride (734-528-5432)
is a $5 shared-ride taxi service within the city
of Ann Arbor, and it runs from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Monday through Friday and 7 p.m. to 7:30
a.m. Saturday and Sunday. Also, if you decide
to take a cab, make sure you ask the driver to
wait until you are safely inside your destina-
tion before leaving.
Though these safety tips are crucial to
assuring personal security, promoting these
suggestions is only the beginning of what can
and should be done to improve safety through-
out campus. With everyone's attention turned
toward the recent Oxford-area crimes, it's up
to us - the student body - to come together
to initiate positive, proactive changes in safety
procedure. Working alongside the Dean of
Student's Office, we plan to organize a cross-
campus safety coalition with representatives
from MSA, LSA Student Government, Greek
Life and other student organizations. With
everyone on board, we will have the capability
to pool our resources, streamline information
to students in efficient and creative ways and
determine which next step will have the great-
est, most direct impact on student safety.
We are enthusiastic about the student
response thus far, and we hope to expand this
dialogue between all interested students in
order to construct the safest campus possible.
If you are interested in participating in this
discussion, please join us at our meetings on
Fridays at 2 p.m. in MSA Chambers (3rd floor
of the Michigan Union). We look forward to
collaborating with you to make a lasting dif-
ference at the University.
Josh Buoy and Stephanie Hamel
are the chair and vice chair of the MSA
Student Safety Commission.

As a self-defined political geek, I've always had faith
in the American political system. I've always believed in
this democracy and its limitless potential. But like many
others, I've been disgusted with the level of partisanship
that has plagued America over these past couple years.
It seems that ifa Republican proposes a piece of legisla-
tion, Democrats in Congresswill inevitably shut it down.
If President Barack Obama suggests a bill, Speaker of the
House John Boehner predictably opposes every aspect
of it. Elected officials have stopped trying to determine
whether or not the ideas of their political opponents are
valid and simply oppose them regardless of their pos-
sible potential.
In recentyears, this unprecedented level of partisan-
ship has been readily apparent. In November's midterm
election, matters appeared to grow worse when the
Republicans gained control of the House, thus polariz-
ing our political system even more. I was beginning to
lose faith. I was sure that neither side would be able to
accomplish anything so long as there was a Democratic
president and a Republican House. Two more years of
ineffective government seemed inevitable. But then, as
so many times before, America united in the face of trag-
edy.
On the morning of Jan. 8, 2011, Congresswoman
Gabrielle Giffords was shot along with 18 others in Tuc-
son, Ariz. During the memorial service for the victims
of this tragedy, Obama spoke about bipartisanship in
one of his most inspirational and least politically-driven
speeches thus far in his presidency. He outlined for all
Americans how we can honor Representative Giffords
and the other victims by working together to end par-
tisanship.
Soon after Obama's touching speech, members of
both political parties worked together to create a new
seating arrangement for the State of the Union address.
Unlike the usual seating arrangement based on party
affiliation, this one was randomized and had Democrats

and Republicans sitting among each other. While many
believe this unprecedented seating was irrelevant and
unnecessary, it actually stood for something much more
than a random arrangement.
For the first time in a couple years, Americans were
able to watch their elected officials act civilly toward
each other. Considering that the last State of the Union
was interrupted by Congressman Joe Wilson shout-
ing out "You lie!" at the president, it was refreshing to
see Democrats and Republicans clapping and laughing
together. However, as Obama made it very clear in his
State of the Union speech, "What comes of this moment
will be determined not by whether we can sit together
tonight, but whether we can work together tomorrow."
Unlike most State of the Union speeches, Obama
focused on both parties working together in order to
achieve American prosperity. Instead of commenting
on politically-dividing topics, the president honed in
on why and how the government can work together in
order to produce the most efficient outcome for America.
So what now? Will our government officials happily
work together and pass every piece oflegislation thatthe
country needs? The answer is obviously no. The presi-
dent made it extremely clear in his speech that we won't
always agree on everything, and that's fine. In fact, it's
this disagreementthat allows America to be the greatest
country on Earth. What we must understand is that just
because we may not politically agree with each other
on certain topics, we must still work together in a civil
way in order to accomplish greatness. As the president
appropriately said in his State of the Union address, "We
will move forward together, or not at all."
In order to secure the future of this amazing country,
we must be willing to reach across the table. Only then
will we together, as one people, be able to give our chil-
dren a better world than the one we were given.

In the past year, Bain added,
the Clinical Rounds Project has
expanded to the history and
social science cohorts as well as
the program's original focal areas
of math and science.
The School of Education has
also recently begun focusing on
"high-leverage practices" which
emphasize experiential learning
and interacting with students.
It is essential to produce stu-
dents who have good teaching
skills upon graduation, Bain said,
especially in the current lacklus-
ter job market. The recent chang-
es to the system allow student
interns to practice and learn with
students and teachers before
jumping into their own class-
rooms. In order to learn, student
interns are "paired with teach-
ers who are teaching in ways we
want our students to see," Bain
said.

DeCarlo wrote in an e-mail inter-

Project has helped her get ready
for her future career.
After experiencing both the
initial phases of the program last
year and the full program this
year she feels the new methods
have been beneficial.
"After seeing five different
teachers and all of the projects
we have covered, I'll be prepared
for our (full-time) student teach-
ing this fall," DeCarlo said.
Similarly, Education senior
Kent Sparks said the hands-on
experience has been advanta-
geous.
"Being able to collaborate with
five different teachers and dis-
tricts before I student teach full-
time really prepares me for the
challenges, of being a successful
teacher," Sparks said. "Having
this extensive firsthand experi-
ence is what makes the difference
and sets this program apart."
School of Education Dean
Deborah Ball said the Clinical
Rounds Project is necessary to
better prepare students for their
future.
Before the program was fully

implemented, Ball said, "A lot was
resting onteachers learning from
their own experience."
Now, Ball added, studentshave
the opportunity to learn in their
"field experiences." Ball said she
hopes the skills students learn
in the School of Education will
spread to other parts of the coun-
try, especially to urban areas.
"Kids deserve to have a good
education," Ball said.

has also modified its curriculum
to include additional student-
teaching requirements. Student
interns now work six hours per
week for their first three semes-
ters and spend the last semester
teaching full-time, according to
Betsy Davis, an associate profes-
sor in the School of Education.
Both the elementary educa-
tion and secondary education
programs videotape the students
teaching in order to help them
evaluate their own classroom
performances.
Cathy Reischl, a clinical asso-
ciate professor in the School of
Education, said another new pro-
gram is the Mitchell/Scarlett-U-

M Partnership, previously called
the lab school program. The part-
nership serves as a supplementa-
ry way for Education students to
study how to support children as
they learn, Reischl said.
Throughthepartnership, Edu-
cation undergraduate and gradu-
ate students work with students
in Ann Arbor's Mitchell Elemen-
tary School and Scarlett Middle
School before, during and after
school hours.
By participating in the pro-
gram, Reischl said, Education
student interns are learning to
teach by directly working with
skilled teachers and students.
One of the program's current
goals is enhancing long-term
professional development of
English as a Second Language
programs for K-5 teachers, Reis-
chi said.
Mitchell Elementary School
Principal Kathy Scarnecchia said
the partnership gives everyone
involved "opportunities to grow."
"Our teachers will begin to
articulate students their skills
(and) the students will get the
best teachers possible," Scarnec-
chia said.

If passed, city ordinance
would prohibit felons from
owning pot dispensaries,


ing properly within the first few
weeks of launch, the team has had
numerous accomplishments.
Tests completed from the RAX
lab, which is housed in the Fran-
gois-Xavier Bagnoud building on
North Campus, confirmed the
satellite's altitude determination
sensors, GPS receiver and anten-
na were working.
Spangelo, who leads efforts to
analyze the satellite's GPS data,
said confirming the receiver's
functionality was a "milestone"
for the team.
"Everyone was like, 'Oh my
God, it works, it works, it works!'
" she said. "It was such a profound
moment because we had strug-
gled so much with the system on
the ground."

Aside from completing opera-
tions work for the current RAX
mission, Sloboda said team mem-
bers are planning to launch a
second RAX as well as a satellite
called M-Cubed, which is slated
to go into orbit this fall.
The second RAX will have a
similar mission as the first RAX,
Sloboda said, but the second satel-
lite will have "enhanced capabili-
ties."
"We will probably do some
things to the (new) spacecraft
that will allow us to do more sci-
ence, or better science, or both,"
he said.
The NASA-funded M-Cubed
satellite, which members of the
RAX team are working on with
the University's Student Space

Systems Fabrication Lab, will
have a slightly different aim, Slo-
boda said. However, the details
aren't finalized, and the M-Cubed
satellite's mission is still in its
early developmentstages, he said.
Throughout the remainder of
the RAX's one-year mission, the
team will continue to tackle any
problems it faces, Spangelo said.
"There were some challenges
addressingthe functioning of the
power system, which I'm current-
ly studying," she said. "We have
to figure out the missing pieces
about what's happening."
While the current mission is
keeping the team busy, Sloboda
said the students are anticipating
the next two spacecrafts' launch-
es.

drug felon like himself would be
so open about his line of work,
Rice acknowledged he is con-
cerned about federal authorities,
but said generating awareness
about medical marijuana is the
reason he's in business.
"My job is 75 percent educa-
tion," Rice said. "The other 25
percent is protesting."
At last week's City Council
meeting, several community
members voiced their concerns
that the city's current temporary
moratorium regulating medical
marijuana dispensaries doesn't
do enough to protect the per-
sonal information of dispensary
and cultivation facility owners.
The temporary moratorium will
expire at the end of the month,
according to previous articles in
The Michigan Daily.
Gershom Avery, a Dexter resi-
dent and medical marijuana pro-
ponent, said in a Jan. 19 article in
The Michigan Daily saying that
he doesn't think the ordinance in
question should require dispen-
sary owners to register their per-
sonal information.
"The best solution isnto remove
the temptation to act as an agency
of the federal government ... by
not compiling these lists," Avery
said.
Rice said he doesn't think
the final draft of the ordinance
will call for owners to have their
information listed.
"I think they will ultimately
not require that," Rice said. "It's a
violation of patients' rights."
Rice said if the final draft of
the ordinance does contain such
a clause, owners will comply, but
not without resistance.
"We'll abide by it, but we'll sue
them," Rice said.
Rice opened his dispensary on
Feb. 2, 2010, he said, mainly to
raise money for Rainbow Farm
in Newberg Township, Mich.
Rainbow Farm is a pro-marijuana
campground that was forced to
close in 2001 after a deadly stand-
off between its members and the
FBI and Michigan State Police.
Last year, Rice had his own
run-in with law enforcement offi-
cials. He said on March 14, police
came to his office after a fellow
tenant reported the smell of mari-
juana.
Ann Arbor Police Chief Barnett
Jones said that officers seized
17 to 19 plants in Rice's office,
according to a Jan. 23 AnnArbor.
com article.
Rice said officers seized 30
marijuana plants, which are
worth $1,000 each. He said police
also seized his computer.
Though he was able to open for
business the next day, Rice said he

didn't have enough money to buy
more plants for six months.
"I want my meds back, I want
my computer back and I want an
apology," Rice said.
Rice said he doesn't think the
city will voluntarily give back his
property.
Rice added that he thinks Ann
Arbor's dispensary industry cares
more for patients and is more
sensitive to its public image than
other areas.
"We don't have four-foot neon
signs in the front windows like
they do a quarter mile from the
state Capitol," Rice said.
Though Rice said he thinks
community members respect his
business, one of his fellowtenants
disagreed with this assessment.
Dawn Nelson, owner of Ann
Arbor Hair Studio, located in suite
306 at 202 E. Washington St., said
her experiences with Rice in the
building have beennegative.
Nelson said she doesn't think
Rice runs a legitimate business
because he chooses not to be
listed on the building's directory.
However, at the time of Rice's
interview with the Daily, his
suite was listed as AP2PCC onthe
building's exterior directory.
"He does not advertise where
he is in the building, which leads
me to believe that is an illegal
business," Nelson said. "If you
were a legal business you would
want to advertise where you are
so that people could find you."
Because the location of Rice's
business isn't easily identifiable,
Nelson said, people who want
to purchase his.products enter
her hair salon asking where they
can buy marijuana. She also said
she thinks the dispensary's pres-
ence inthe building poses a safety
problem.
"I feel extremely unsafe since
he's been there," Nelson said.
"I've had a break-in at my salon."
Building Manager Jerry Spears
said Rice's one-year lease expires
at the end of the month.
This week, Monroe resident
Ken Rutherford went to Rice's
office to seek treatment for
Guillain-Barrd syndrome, which
causes body numbness and mus-
cle weakness.
Rutherford, who came to the
office in a mobilized wheelchair,
said medical procedures to treat
his disease didn't alleviate his
pain.
"They made a guinea pig out of
me," Rutherford said.
Rice said the proposed City
Council ordinance would set a
standard for cities throughoutcthe
state and the country.
"Ann Arbor's ordinance is real-
ly going to be monumental," Rice
said. "The rest of the state is going
to have to look at it and follow."


how ocean ecosystems work will
improve environmental sustain-
ability policies.
"It is not an option not to
know," Earle said. "Our lives
depend on it."
While Earle talked critically
about the depletion of the earth's
natural resources, the extinction
of species and how humans are
slowly "turning our blue planet
into a red planet," she expressed
much optimism as well.
Urgingstudentstoget involved
through rising environmental
awareness, Earle added that the
urgency of the situation creates a
perfect environment for change.
"Now is the time to make a

difference," she said. "To under-
stand what we just could not
know before we could go up in
space ... and dive down in the
ocean."
Students on the LSA Theme
Semester Steering Committee
have been actively promoting
the event around campus, and
said last night they were eager to
finally hear from Earle.
LSA senior Taylor Coyne said
she was thankful the University
brought an environmental expert
like Earle to talk as part of the
theme semester.
"She's a renowned water
expert in the world, so the fact
that she's coming here and talk-

ing, it's very impressive," Coyne
said.
LSA sophomore Maggie Oli-
ver and LSA and Business junior
Poonam Dagli, who are on the
steering committee, said the
event was a crucial way for stu-
dents to learn about the impor-
tance of this semester's theme.
"Being environmentally based
is really important," Dagli said.
"It's really exciting for the Uni-
versity to go to this level and
decide this is what they want to
advocate."
Oliver added, "It's just gener-
ating so much awareness about
water issues. She's very refresh-
ing, pun intended."


BELL TOWER
From Page 1A
ing of the bell chamber floor and
the replacement of the transmis-
sion systems on bells affected
by the structural work, the press
release states.
According to a proposal sub-
mitted to the University's Board
of Regents on June 17, 2010, the
repairs are necessary because of
the damage and deterioration of
the building's infrastructure.
Throughout the construction,
the carillon and its chimes have
been temporarily silenced. This

is the second time in the tower's
75-year history that the bells have
not rung routinely, according to a
June 2010University press release.
The last time the chimes and
bells were silenced was in March
2006 after a pair of peregrine fal-
cons, which are on the Michigan
endangered species list, were
spotted on the tower, according to
a March 13, 2006 Michigan Daily
article.
Because peregrine falcons are
frequently observed on the tower,
the current construction schedule
works around them, according to
the September press release.
In addition to the silenced

chimes, the clock permanently
displays the time as 6:30. Howev-
er, the clock should work properly
by the end of the school year.
LSA sophomore Amanda Czik
said she's noticed the silence of
the tower during the day, but
understands its necessity.
"It's weird not hearing the
chimes anymore," Czik said. "But
I think the construction is impor-
tant for the building, so it's not
that big of a deal to me."
In addition to keeping time for
people on campus, the tower also
houses School of Music, Theatre
& Dance classrooms and offices
for the Department of Musicology

and Ethnomusicology, Univer-
sity Musical Society and Charles
Baird Carillon. These locations,
however, are unaffected by the
construction, according to the
September press release.
Though the construction has
been in progress for the major-
ity of the school year, students
say it doesn't seem to have a large
impact on their daily routines.
"I have class in the Modern
Language Building, so I walk by
the bell tower often," Czik said.
"The construction stays out of
the way of most students, so I am
looking forward to the improve-
ments of the tower."

Sedative maker says drug not meant for execution

Drug manufacturer that Oklahoma already uses to do
so - said yesterday it opposes the
asks Okla. officials practice and has askedbothstates
to stop using the drug.
to stop use Pentobarbital maker Lundbeck
Inc. says it never intended for the
COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - drug to be used to put inmates to
The sole U.S. manufacturer of a death.
sedative that Ohio plans to use to "This goes against everything
execute death row inmates - and we're in business to do," Sally

Benjamin Young, spokeswoman
for the Denmark-based compa-
ny's U.S. headquarters in Deer-
field, Ill., told The Associated
Press.
"We like to develop and make
available therapies that improve
people's lives," she said. "That's
the focus of ourbusiness."
State prison officials in Ohio

and Oklahoma both said they
hadn't seen copies of the letter
yesterday and could not com-
ment.
Oklahoma has used the drug
in combination with two others
in three executions, while Ohio
announced Tuesday it is switch-
ing to the sedative as the sole
drug used to put inmates to death.

Lundbeck does not sell the
product directly to end users and
has no way of preventing either
state from usingthe drug.
"While we cannot control
how our products are admin-
istered, it is our intent that
our products be used in a safe
and appropriate manner and
encourage use consistent with

the label," the company said in
a statement.
Ohio has not yet purchased its
first supplies and Oklahoma has
said it obtains its supply from a
private pharmacy.
Both states switched to pen-
tobarbital as a national shortage
worsened of the drug they used
previously, sodium thiopental.

Struggling MSU gives
'M' chance to snap skid

Lynch in a scoring drought
for second straight season

By BEN ESTES
Daily Sports Writer
Zack Novak hates Michigan
State.
The junior guard for the
Michigan men's basketball team
said Wednesday that his rivals
throughout his life have all worn
green and white - so for Novak,
adopting the Spartans as hated
competitors was an "easy transi-
tion."

midable as was
predicted enter-
ing the season.
Despite returning almost their
entire team, the Spartans (4-3 Big
Ten, 12-7 overall) have fallen off
from their preseason No. 2 rank-
ingto No.25.
And Michigan State has won
just two of its past five games,
needingovertimeinbothvictories
despite playing athome. Still, don't
tell Michigan coach John Beilein
that the Spartans have slipped.
"(They're) not struggling,"
Beilein said. "They've played an
incredible schedule ... They're
going to make the NCAA Tour-
nament. They're a heck of a team
(and) they've got a heck of a
coach.
"These are part of the things
that you go through. You can't win
every game."
Michigan State ranks seventh
in the conference in both scoring
offense and defense.And now the
Spartans must play the rest of the
season without key reserve guard
Korie Lucious, who was kicked
off the team on Tuesday night by
coach Tom Izzo for conduct detri-
mental to the program.
But the team still has a trio of
weapons, including point guard
and defending Big Ten Player of
the Year Kalin Lucas (14.4 points
per game), his backcourt mate
Durrell Summers (13.9 points per
game) and the bruising Draymond
Green (13.2 points per game, 8.8
rebounds per game).
And Michigan has been strug-
gling even more than its rival, hav-
ing lost its last six games. Beilein
said he's seen the team improving
every day in practice - even if it
hasn't translated on the score-
board - but admitted that a lot of
the Wolverines' problems aren't
going to suddenly evaporate when
they take the court in East Lan-
sing.

Sophomore forward

time for defense
and penalty killing
By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Editor
While games aren't played
on paper, Kevin Lynch's season
has been defined by the third-
to-last page of the game notes
every week.
Under Lynch's name in the
No. 6 Michigan hockey team's
game-by-game scoring break-
down is half a page of 0-0-0
lines. The sophomore forward
hasn't registered a point in 13
games.
His last point came over a
month ago, when he scored
two goals on Nov. 20 against
Lake Superior State.
Of all players still on the
team and not injured, the only
player who has a longer score-
less streak is senior goaltender
Shawn Hunwick, who is cur-
rently just one game behind
Lynch.
The statistic sheet isn't the
only indication of Lynch's scor-
ing issues.
Lynch got off the ice after
practice on Tuesday and smiled
at the mention of the scoreless
streak.
"I knew sometime, at some
point this was coming," Lynch
said.
He should have. He's no

about a good player beating a play-
er who's younger.
"It's about a strong player or
taller player scoring over some-
body. It's not a schematic thing.
It's just-part of (being young)."
A lot of contributors for Michi-
gan have yet to even play the
Spartans, let alone at the hostile
confines of Breslin, with its infa-
mous "Izzone" student section.
These young Wolverines may be
in for a rude awakening when
they see just how intense the
rivalry game is. Novak knows,
and he was reminded about
it this week when he traded
emails with former Michigan
player Dani Wohl (2002-05).
The subject was about a
potential internship for Novak,
but Wohl made sure to mention
just how important it was to beat
Michigan State.
"I think this is one of those
games where you throw records
aside," Novak said. "You throw
everything aside. It's Michigan-
Michigan State. It's going to be a
dogfight."
Look no further than Jan. 26
of last year. The then-5th ranked
Spartans came into Crisler Arena
but narrowly escaped with a
57-56 victory after former Wol-
verine DeShawn Sims's potential
game-winning shot rimmed out
at the buzzer.
Michigan State still has its
trademark physicality, especially
on the glass. Michigan was out-
rebounded by Indiana 37-18 and
by Minnesota 38-13.
The Spartans are third in the
Big Ten in rebounding margin,
meaning the Wolverines will
have to toughen up down low.
Michigan hasn't defeated
Michigan State since2007,losing
its last four games to the Spar-
tans. And this edition of the in-
state battle would seem to be an

unlikely time for the Wolverines
to break that streak, especially
given their current overall losing
skid.
Still, Novak and his team are
hopeful because of the anything-
goes nature of the teams' rivalry.
"There's games we could've
won and there's games we
should've won (in Michigan's past
six games)," Novak said. "But it's
over now. We got a great opportu-
nity coming up (Thursday).
"(If we) go up there and get a
win, then that's a huge kickstart in
the other direction."

An unusual path for three Michigan brothers

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Wrestling.
To many, it's a sign of broth-
erly love. A way to hash out sibling
rivalries and declare oneself to be
atop the household hierarchy; the
best, the toughest, the macho-est
of all.
Craig and Susan Zeerip saw a
great love for wrestling from their
three sons beginning at an early
age in their Fremont, Mich. home.
However, their sons never outgrew
their wrestling ways.
The couple doesn't have to see
their sons duke it out at home any-
more, though.
Instead, they travel to Ann
Arbor, where their three sons -
redshirt junior Justin, redshirt
freshman Brandon and freshman
Collin - are members of the Mich-
igan wrestling team.
It's nearly unheard of for three
brothers to compete on one team at
such a highlevel, but it's even more
unusual that this family can even
utter the words, "Go Blue."
Craig and Susan are graduates
of Ohio State, where Craig wres-
tled in the mid-1980s - even Jus-
tin and Brandon grew up diehard
Buckeye fans.
These days, they laugh at stories
of getting heckled by classmates
for wearing Buckeye attire.
"Growing up in Michigan, there
were alot of Michigan fans around
us," Justin said. "Especially when
we were growing up, Michigan
was winning a lot in the Michigan-
Ohio State (football) game; we'd
always get crap. People would even
leave messages on the answering
machine."
Only Collin can lay claim to
being a lifelong Wolverine.
From a young age, pictures
showhimsportingMichiganattire
next to his scarlet and gray-clad
brothers.
This season, Justin is 12-7, while
Brandon - the reigning Big Ten
Wrestler of the Week - is 2-1. Col-
lin, meanwhile, is redshirting this
season.

SMALL TOWN ROOTS
The journey to Ann Arbor start-
ed in two small, neighboring towns
three and a half hours west of Ann
Arbor - Hesperiaand Fremont.
Craig and Susan met at Ohio
State and married. After gradu-
ating, they moved to Fremont -
where Craig grew up - and have
since taken over the Zeerip family
business, Heritage Farms, which
provides fresh produce to Meijer.
In 1990, Craigbecame the head
coach of the Hesperia High School
wrestling team, located three
miles from his house. He remained
head coach for the next 15 years,
but .later swapped roles with the
assistant coach prior to Justin's
arrival to high school.
"It's a wrestling community,"
Craig said. "We have a huge fan
base. They love wrestling. There
isn't a lot to do in Hesperia. That's
why I think wrestling does very
well in Hesperia as far as atten-
dance."
Craig estimates that Hespe-
ria draws approximately 700 to
800 fans at the wrestling meets.
To put that into perspective, the
town's population is under 1,000.
The town has two traffic lights
- shocking when you consider
that there are triple that number
of Hesperia alumni who currently
wrestle for Division-I schools.
Though the average graduating
class at Hesperia is only about 50,
six wrestlers are on scholarship at
premiere programs. Sophomore
Dan Yates - a close family friend
of the Zeerips - joins the broth-
ers on the Michigan squad. Philip
Khozein - who lived with the
Zeerips throughout high school -
is a sophomore at Michigan State
and Malcolm Martin is a freshman
at Central Michigan.
Craig didn't really push wres-
tling on his sons, but in 1997 -
after being at practices and meets
for much of his early life - it was
time for eight-year-old Justin to
give it a try.
"I think they all grew up with
it," Craig said. "And then, since
Justin was going to be wrestling,

then they wanted to wrestle too."
And so it began. In no time, six
year-old Brandon and four year-
old Collin were also on the mats.
The kids - who would create
space to wrestle by moving couch-
es in their living room - now cre-
ate bigger things. And what they
left looms even larger.
BIG FISH FROM A SMALL POND
You'd be hard-pressed to find
a family more accomplished and
well rounded than the Zeerips.
Each brother was class valedictori-
an. And on the mats, they earned a
combined 749 wins and nine state

torious - four of which earned
him state titles.
His 260-match win streak and
his 203 career pins are national
(yes, national) records. To add to
his four wrestling state titles, he
also won two in cross-country.
"We probably lefta pretty good
legacy in Hesperia," Collin, the last
brother to leave the town, said.
"Everybody not only realizes the
success we had on the mat, but
they also recognize the success
we had in the classroom. I feel like
everybody can look at it and see,
'That's a really positive legacy."'

on campus, and all three speak
highly of the support they pro-
vide each other, whether it's in the
weight room or dealing with per-
sonal issues.
Their success drives each other.
"There was a little bit of pres-
sure to always follow in their foot-
steps," Collin said. "But at the same
time, I tried using that to motivate
me, I'm with them everyday. I'm
working hard with those guys. I
look at it like, 'If they're really suc-
cessful in high school, and they're
really successful in college, why
can't I doit?'"
Though it was initially hard,
the Zeerips - even Susan's side of
the family, who live in the heart of
Buckeye country - can all proudly
sport their maize and blue - at
least during wrestling meets.
But everything changes during
the weekend of The Game.
"(My parents) weren't that
intense about it, but they had some
family friends over who were giv-
ing us more crap," Justin said.
"Down in Ohio, all my (family who
went to Ohio State), they definitely
give us alot more crap."

This Friday, Michigan - and
the Zeerip family - will make the
trip to Columbus, as the Wolver-
ines take on their heated rival.
Interestingly enough, it's alum-
ni night at St. John Arena - mean-
ing all alumni wrestlers, including
Craig, are invited to walk out prior
to the match.
"It's been a lot of fun so far,
because the questions we've got-
ten,they all want to know what I'm
going to wear when I walk out,"
Craig said. "I might look for one
of those shirts that says, 'House
Divided,' but we're all having fun
with it."
The Zeerips will have more
than 20 extended family members
- all Buckeyes at heart - rooting
on the Wolverines. Well, at least
for two of the matches, anyway.
"When it's family, there's never
a question as to who I'm going to
root for," Craig said. "It was a great
college experience for me at Ohio
State, but when the match gets
rolling, the boys will be at heart.
I am an Ohio State Buckeye, but I
will be cheering for the Michigan
Wolverines that day."

DIAG PARTY SHOPPE
340 South State
For decades, residents west of cam-
pus have debated whether it's worth it to
spend an extra buck to have a sit-down
experience at NYPD or eat on the run at
the less expensive Diag Party Shop. A
slice at Diag has a thicker crust, less gooey
cheese and has probably been sitting out
for a considerable amount of time. The
best pizza in town? No. Worth the lower
price? Maybe.
BACKROOM PIZZA
1204 South University
When the harsh lights of daytime flood
the world, one realizes that unless Back-
room's pizza is fresh from the oven, it has
probably been stagnating for who-knows-
how long. The grease from the under-
sauced pizza makes the flimsy napkins
transparent, and only the most fortified of
stomachs will withstand the queasy feeling
that follows indulging in Backroom pizza
without a shield of cheap vodka.

NYPD
605 East William
New Yorkers are pizza snobs. Though
Ann Arbor is miles away from that thin-
crust city, NYPD does a solid job as a sub-
stitute. The cheese on the cheese pizza is
gooey, but it doesn't glob over like some
New York imitators, and the crust is just
crusty enough - there's a nice crunch as
you take a bite, but it doesn't crumble. If we
didn't know any better, we might say this
was a New York slice - maybe.
SOUTH U PIZZA
1104 South University
If New York pizza is the gold standard,
Ann Arbor's newest grab-a-slice-and-go
joint is the closest it gets to Bleecker Street
heaven: It's cheap, foldable, fast and frea-
kin' delicious. No reheating necessary
- each slice looks and tastes fresh with
an ideal ratio of cheese, sauce and crust,
topped with just enough grease to skip
disgustingness and enter the scrumptious
zone. Drunk or sober, South U is king.

Graduate students
wave their way to a
conducting degree
By VERONICA MENALDI
Daily Arts Writer
Conducting an ensemble
takes more than a few waves of a
baton and a fancy suit - it takes
imagination, patience, knowl-
edge, experience and humility.
Prof. Jerry Blackstone, chair
of the conducting department in
the School of Music, Theatre &
Dance, said that since ensembles
generally consist of people from
a variety of backgrounds, a con-
ductor's job is to unify them.
"The ensemble is as a good
as the conductor," he said. "The
choir will only be as good as the
person standing in front of them,
same is true for an orchestra or
band. Just like a football team,
the members might be really tal-
ented, but until there is someone
there to unify and build a team
and perspective, it's not going to
work."
Arian Khaefi, a choral con-
ducting graduate student, said
he fell in love with conducting
because it allows him to create
music in a collaborative setting.
"I think that (conducting) is a
wonderful way to communicate
with people," Khaefi said. "It's
about the ability to help peo-
ple make fantastic sounds and
shape the music."
Although conducting might
be something a selection of
undergraduates have a strong
passion for, Blackstone said it
isn't offered at that level because
the department wants the stu-
dents to have experience as a
vocalist or instrumentalist.
Students interested in con-
ducting degrees are usually
those who have an undergradu-
ate performance degree or a
liberal arts degree from a pres-
tigious college.
"People who want (the
degree) are people who have a
passion for ensembles, whether
it be vocal, orchestral or band,"
Blackstone said.
Since potential conductors
are required to have a deep
understanding of the piece, they
usually have an undergraduate
focus in theory, musicology or
performance.
"They aren't amateurs,"
Blackstone said. "They are pro-
fessionals that could go in any
direction but chances are, they
got bit by the conducting bug
due to their love for working
with groups of people and mak-
ing an ensemble."
Khaefi's decision to go into
choral conducting started when
he was young, at his grandmoth-
er's wake. He was intrigued by
the classical music playing.
"I've never heard anything
like it before," he said. "Turns
out it was Mozart's Requiem.
After I heard it, I knew I had to
be a part of whatever that was."
Music, Theatre & Dance
junior Ken Sieloff said he has
a strong interest in pursuing a
graduate degree in conducting
- most likely choral, due to his
natural inclination as a leader
and his passion for music.
"I've always been a leader,"
Sieloff said. "Not only musically,

but with things outside of music

as well. There's something about
the preparation that goes into
conducting and actually con-
ducting a performance that is
really satisfying to my inner
musician."
Sieloff added that, as a con-
ductor, the relationship that
develops with the members of
an ensemble and with the music
is highly rewarding.
"Being able to study a single
piece of music so deeply that
you know it inside and out really
gives you an interesting connec-
tion," he said.
The University's program has
three divisions of conducting
classes - vocal, orchestral and
band, each led by a faculty mem-
ber who focuses in that area. In
those classes, two or three times
a week, a student will stand up
and conduct while everyone else
sings or plays. At the conclu-
sion, the professor responds to
the student's conducting. The
sessions are recorded for the
student to look back upon and
improve. In addition, students
will continue to have private les-
sons in their major instrument,
where they will learn to polish
their aural skills, as well as tak-
ing classes in music theory and
history.
Generally speaking, Black-
stone said finding a conducting
job post graduation is very com-
petitive and difficult, though
University students tend to find
positions.
"If a conductor is willingto go
anywhere, then you have a much
better chance of getting a job,"
he said.
The secrets to conducting
Sieloff said one of the main
characteristics a good conductor
needs is humility.
"You don't want to come
across as arrogant; you want to
come across as knowledgeable,"
he said. "It's about not acting
boastful or arrogant but rather
helping to lead."
The long process a conduc-
tor goes through begins with
the selection of the piece and
the decision of how many mem-
bers will be in the ensemble.

After that, the conductor has to
determine the ensemble's skill
level. Other factors that need
to be decided are how long to
rehearse, how many rehearsals
to schedule, what the perfor-
mance venue is like and if there
are enough players.
This already very difficult
and exhausting process also
requires additional technical
knowledge. Blackstone said it
is the conductor's job to know
absolutely everything there is to
know about the selected piece,
including its history, informa-
tion about the composer, where
it was written, for who it was
written and the musical quali-
ties of the piece throughout, like
dynamics and texture.
The conductor is also expect-
ed to know where anticipated
problems might occur and how
to prevent them. After the con-
ductor has done all that, he then
has to practice the gestures and
be able to sing along.
The best way for a conduc-
tor to be successful, Blackstone
said, is for them to come into
the first rehearsal with a dream
that turns the black-and-white-
noted sheet paper into music.
"The rehearsals are meant
to develop the orchestra, choir
or band's ability to match that
dream," he said. "If a conductor
has a strong, detailed dream or
imagination, the rehearsals will
be focused, effective and get a
lot more done."
Blackstone said conductors
are also required to know how
to make their bodies produce
the sound they want. Though
it doesn't hurt, conductors
don't have to be great sing-
ers, pianists or able to play
all the instruments, but they
need to understand how the
voice works and how to get the
sounds they imagine out of any
instrument.
"Conductors need to have
done a lot of homework, so
when you conduct you're not
green," he said. "You're an
expert at the piece. You've done
your homework in such a way
that you know it better than
anyone in the room. That way,

THE HILL' (2000), OVERCOAT
Still not over 'Hill ' a decade. later

By EMMA GASE
Daily Music Editor
While today's breed of folksy, envi-
ro-friendly poetry lover is blindly wor-
shiping the bearded ilk of iron & Wine,
the Avett Brothers and Bon Iver to sup-
ply that dose of acoustic singer-song-
writer music, it's unfortunate that nine
out of 10 of these flannel-clad follow-
ers have unwittingly missed one of the
greatest things ever to happen to the
genres of Americana and folk in the last
few decades. For shame, artsy people of
America.
In 2000, small-time musician Rich-
ard Buckner made a decision that would
quietly outshine even the most revered
of Americana musicians. He put Bon
Iver's Justin Vernon in his rightful
place as Mr. Whimper of the aughts,
and reminded us that Monsters of Folk
is merely a vehicle in which four huge
egos perpetually stroke each other.
That year, Buckner set Edgar Lee
Masters's 1915 volume of poetry "Spoon
River Anthology" to music. Named
after one of the poems in the volume,
The Hill was originally released as a
staggeringly perfect 34-minute, sewn-
together single track (later, iTunes
made the songs available individually).
More like a campfire tale or a Larry.
McMurtry novel in musical form than
an album, The Hill is one of those radi-
ant works of art that is oblivious to the
notion of time.
Though the lyrics might not be his
own, Buckner could not have more skill-
fullyrendered asettingon which to place
them. Each one- to two-minute track is
named after a person from Spoon River,
Ind. and focuses on the nature of his or
her death.
Whatever the morbidity may sacri-
fice in lightheartedness, it makes up for
in sheer power of emotion as Buckner
channels the victim's voices: a woman

dying in childbirth or an old man wast-
ing away from illness. On opening track
"Tom Merritt," Buckner details a mur-
der between two lovers that could raise
goosebumps from the hardest of hearts:
"I meant to kill him on sight / But that
day / Walking near Fourth Bridge /
Without a stick or a stone at hand / All of
a sudden / I saw him standing / Scared
to death / Holding his rabbits / And all I
could say was / 'Don't, don't, don't' / As
he aimed and fired at my heart."
Perhaps, more than anything, Buck-
ner's voice is the most valuable asset
The Hill has in its arsenal. Inherently
intimate, melancholic, weird, guttural
and purely American, his trademark
lilting warble at the end of each vocal
run adds the rare X-factor that makes
the other 99 percent of folk singers
sound positively vanilla in comparison.
Remember the year 2000? "Rock"
was being reborn with The Strokes, The
Vines and The Hives; Destiny's Child
wanted us to say their name; Christina
Aguilera and Britney Spears were duk-
ing it out on the charts. Fads, people,
only fads. What about longevity? What
about creating Art?
Richard Buckner's
follow-up explored
Spork Creek.
The Hill is a grounding and endur-
ing stamp on the dateless, the classic,
the ambiguous. This album could have
been recorded in 1915 (sans the electric
guitars) or last month.
It's the simplicitythat does it. It's the
acoustic guitars that sound like they are
being played in your living room, the
warm electric ones that trace the songs

you have the right to lead it."
It takes more than mere musical
details or theory to be successful in both
the rehearsal and the concert.
"A lot of conductors stop at pitch
and rhythm of the song," Khaefi said.
"That's the very basic mechanics of a
piece - it's not even music at that point,
it's just mathematical proportions."
While Khaefi is in front of an ensem-
ble, he has a million thoughts running
through his head.
"When I'm conducting, I'm thinking
about tone, diction, unity, the ensemble
and balance," he said. "I'm thinking of
interesting ways to teach a passage,
innovative ways to get the choir to bond
on a sound, the rehearsals coming up"
Since the University conducting pro-
gram is small and allows the students to
have plenty of conducting practice, stu-
dents like Khaefi get the experience and
feedback necessary to continue improv-
ing and learning to balance the aspects
of leading a group.
Khaefi said the University's pro-
gram is the ideal place for his dream to
become a reality because of its comfort-
able atmosphere and positivity.
"There's no negativity or mean-spir-
itedness that you might find at other
music schools," he said. "I've seen
departments around the country that
don't have that camaraderie. This one is
fantastic."
Ultimately, the type of person who is
inclined to pursue the challenging yet
highly rewarding profession that is con-
ducting need to truly love all aspects of
music and the desire to unify and lead a
group to its greatest potential.
"Are you a person that's in tune with
the people you are working with?"
Khaefi asked. "Are you able to be com-
manding and inspiring? Can you inspire
people to perform the music they are
performing better than if you weren't
standing in front of them?"
It's these qualities and more that
allow aspiring conductors to paint
music across theater halls and into the
hearts of listeners.

COURTESY OF OVERCOAT

Get off of my hill.
like fine embroidery on a cozy quilt,
the mandolins and tambourine that
garnish the record with their jubilant
underlying presence. Simple instru-
ments, simple lyrics, simple production.
We seem to have forgotten one of the
most rewarding qualities of truly great
art - the virtue of subtlety. We live in
a world of singles with flashy hooks,
booming beats and raging techno
anthems - all of which constantly pile
on top of each other in an exhausting
(and raunchy) rat race to be declared
The Next Big Thing. In 2000, Richard
Buckner was not The Next Big Thing.
In fact, he has probably never even been
described (or besmirched) by a phrase
as stupid and meaningless as The Next
Big anything, and if he were, he's most
likely Above It.
The Hill stands - no, towers - above
its peers. Trendy alt-country bands

can't touch this record with a 10-foot
pole; no folksy troubadour could sound
more authentic if he roamed the Appa-
lachian Mountains hunting deer with
a harmonica dangling from his neck.
Edgar Lee Masters laid the foundation
with his poetry, and Buckner's emotive
voice cements "Spoon River Anthol-
ogy" into true timelessness - almost a
century after the poems were written.
When the first moments of the album
dissolve from instrumental feedback
and swirl into the opening chords and
underlying strings of the first two-
minute segment, the effect can only
be described as revelatory. Why can't
all music sound like this? Shouldn't
all music sound like this? So thank
you, Tom Merritt and other tragically
deceased citizens - though you don't
survive in Spoon River, you will live
forever on The Hill.

NONFICTION
From Page 1B
It takes a mediator, someone to coax that
hidden ego out of its protective shell, to
break it down into its component parts
only to build it back up again. That some-
one is John Rubadeau.
Rubadeau began teaching sections of
English 325 (Art of the Essay) and Eng-
lish 425 (Advanced Essay Writing) at the
University 24 years ago after a brief stint
as a writing instructor at Purdue.
"I wish I could say it was by design,
but it was more by accident," Rubadeau
said of becoming a professor. "I had
been a social worker in Europe as a field
worker for the Red Cross, and then I got
into teaching by accident, and I just fell
in love with it."
To facilitate the labor that goes into
producing these miniature memoirs,
Rubadeau said the first three weeks of
his classes are devoted to personal intro-
ductions. A considerable amount of time
is spent on classroom bonding - the stu-
dents chat freely during class periods,
finding out about each other's lives and
their professor.
"The pedagogic reason behind this is
to develop a sense of community before
we discuss essays that are often extraor-
dinarily personal and intimate," he said.
As he likes to call it, it's a process of
"making the public private."
This camaraderie is further facilitat-
ed by an unexpected visitor: Rubadeau's
facial hair. On Halloween, he dyes his
fully grown beard orange to resemble a
grinning jack-o-lantern. During Christ-
mas, he comes into class bedecked with
twinkling Christmas lights and a few
spinning dreidels. On the rest of the
days, he has been known to wiggle the
whiskers in question in front of unas-
suming girls' faces.
"I've gotten a couple good beard rubs
from John Rubadeau," Hlebasko said of
her time as his student.
The beard is only one example of what
Rubadeau considers to be the secret to
being a good teacher: enthusiasm.
"If you aren't enthusiastic, feign
enthusiasm," he said. "But here's the
thing: I've never had to feign enthusi-
asm. I'm always so enthusiastic because
I'm teaching kids what they need to
know, what they need to know for the
real world.
"It sounds so strange, but I look
forward every day to going to class,"
he added. "If I could design my life, I
couldn't design a better life. I'm never
going to retire. I want to die when I'm
about 100 writing on the chalkboard,
talking about dangling participles."
Tell the truth, but tell it slant
Once the community and level of
comforthave been established, how does
one begin the essay?
"First you start out with a statement,"

Rubadeau said. "How do you integrate it
into the story that you're trying to tell?
And then you give details - I mean, it's
so simple. The writer who writes doesn't
even know his intention, he just writes
because it's a therapeutic process."
Then comes the main argument, the
thing the essay will signify.
"Pursue the answer to a question that
you genuinely want to know the answer
to," Pollack said.
This is a guiding principle in Pollack's
book "Creative Nonfiction," which was
published two years ago for classroom
use. Through she currently presides over
graduate-level work, Pollack sustains an
interest in the field of personal mem-
oir, and instated the creative nonfiction
writing program at the undergraduate
level several years ago.
"Scratch your itch," Rubadeau
explained. "What interests you? What
bothers you? What do you have ques-
tions about? Write about that, but dis-
passionately."
But issues will start to arise a few
paragraphs into the essay. For instance,
how much faith can a writer put in his
own hazy memories of an event long
past? How much creative liberty to take
in describing a scene that one barely has
a memory of? There's a certain ambigu-
ity associated with the work of a non-
fiction writer, a struggle with fitting a
messy, fractured life neatly into a con-
fines of a few blank pages.
Pollack puts it in simpler terms: If you
feel instinctively that whatever you are
saying is dishonest, you shouldn't write
it down.
"There are some people that say, 'Oh,
memory is faulty' or 'We're always mak-
ing things up' - they see nonfiction as
just as much an act of memory and imag-
ination as fiction," Pollack said. "I don't
really buy that. I think that we all know
when we're telling the truth to the best
of our abilities and we know when we're
not quite sure of something."
Pollack went on to mention the extent
of the truthfulness that readers expect
from a writer.
"If you said, 'I climbed Mt. Everest'
and you didn't, they would feel cheated,"
Pollack said. "If you said that you were
breaking up with your girlfriend in a bar
one night and Linda Ronstadt was sing-
ing 'Blue Bayou' on whatever goes for a
jukebox today, and we found it really was
Lucinda Williams singing 'Car Wheels
on a Gravel Road,' nobody's going to feel
cheated, right?"
Entering into conversation
But the writing doesn't stop after the
first draft is handed in.
"I have a whole big lecture - I say, you
know, your brothers and sisters said I
was a good teacher and all that shit, but
it's because I have high expectations,"
Rubadeau said.
Each session after the first three
weeks of his courses is devoted to cri-

tiquing and praising all of the 20 essays
produced by the 20 students in the class
- one student and one essay per day. To
prepare, every student is expected to
write at least five to six pages about that
session's essay, leading to an individual
collection of papers that often surpass-
es the 200-page mark by the end of the
semester.
"Oh, man, every Mondayand Wednes-
day night I would be on my laptop all
night long," said Engineering junior
Jacob Flood. "Your grade is dependent
mostly on what you write about other
people's papers. (Rubadeau) says, the
more you critique somebody else, the
more you'll learn about your own writ-
ing."
"I know that sounds like an ungodly
amount of work, but you definitely knock
those out way quicker than a traditional
analytical English paper," Hlesbasko
added. "It's just kind of you in dialogue
with the paper and this person that cre-
ated it."
After all, you never write in a vacu-
um - a large part of crafting a personal
essay is sharing it with others. In writ-
ing peer critiques, the writer creates
the discourse space needed to discuss
remarkably intimate subjects in a more
objective manner.
"Revising your essay wasn't just about
mechanics you worked on," Flood said.
"It had more to do with substance - what
you wanted to know more about."
By extension, this collaboration leads
to greater classroom bonding.
"We were incredibly close," Flood
said. "I feel like more so than comma
splices and misplaced modifiers, we
were in a class to articulate and express
profound things that we had in ourlives.
And that would connect us as friends
more so than in any other class.
"The one class period that really
stood out for me when this guy talked
about this abusive relationship he had
with his father, and it was just so ... it.
just seemed to transcend any normal
classroom experience," he added. "And
we weren't talking about trite mechan-
ics at that point, we were talking about
something that was clearly still affect-
ing him, it was something he was look-
ing for and in that class I think he finally
found it."
In having students pen these evoca-
tive, raw experiences, the ultimate
objective of English 325 and 425 is to
bring light to these encounters, to reiter-
ate themes about the world that fiction
writers couldn't have articulated any
better - just by nature of the essayists'
proximity to real life.
Rubadeau distilled the goals that he
wanted to leave in his students in a few
brief sentences.
"I want them to fall in love with the
language and the etymology of words,
make them aware that the things I'm
trying to teach them can't be put to
memory," he said. "I want to them to get
at the human condition."

Poets perform to
hometown crowd

Poetry is timeless. It fills volumes
upon volumes with sonnets, iam-
bic pentameter, odes and couplets. It
provides insight to

"I think a lot of Tickets from $5
people - not myself
personally - think of boring old white
men reading and writing poems back
in the olden days and get turned off
by that," said Peggy Burrows, a 2010
University alum and a member of
Ann Arbor Wordworks, a local poetry
group.
The concept of poetry is completely
different for Burrows.
"It's spoken word," she said. "Really
beautiful things that you wouldn't have
thought of are brought to the table."
Wordworks was formed by a group
of students who had been involved
with the Volume Youth Poetry Project,
an after-school program that works
with high school students to write
poetry and learn poetic technique.
Today, Wordworks is composed of 15
members who attend a variety of uni-
versities throughout the state and pro-
mote poetry through performance and
speech.
This Thursday, the group will per-
form poetry in its biggest event of the
year, entitled Homegrown.
"Every year we find a new vein to
run through the whole show. This year,
it's sort of the evolution of our writ-
ing," said Ben Alfaro, a junior at Wayne
State University. "Some of that will
entail poems we wrote when we were
really young.
"There are so many strong voices in
Ann Arbor Wordworks that in a span of
15 minutes, you're going to get a set of
voices that are powerful on their own,"
Alfaro added. "It sort of builds this
chord of sound."
According to Burrows, the perfor-
mance won't be what many would
expect of a poetry reading.
"You don't quietly snap when
you hear something you like - it's a
very interactive, high-energy per-
formance," Burrows said. "We try to
engage the audience - we have fun

pieces, serious pieces and group pieces
so you can see we're a unit, not just
individual people."
Burrows, who started writing when
she was a kid, always knew she liked
poetry.
"I always wanted to write and be
creative ... and I sort of latched onto
this form," she said.
At first, it was difficult for Burrows
to write her poems without worrying
about how the audience would inter-
pret them. She would try to mold her
writing to what she thought the audi-
ence would like best, but that didn't
work out well.
"I stopped thinking about other
people readingit and for me, that made
it a lot easier," Burrows said.
Now she writes for herself, which
also has benefits when she performs.
"The audience feels more con-
nected to it when it's honest and real
- it's very obvious that you feel this
and you're not just saying this to have
something to say," she said.

As the audience will see in Home-
grown, Alfaro's style has evolved as
well.
"I used to write more about fam-
ily and relationship stuff," Alfaro said.
"But now my writing is sort of turning
this corner. I'm talking about bigger
issues going on around me ... I'm sort
of trying to give my poems social con-
text."
He added, "I think it personally
grounds it more."
Apart from school and Wordworks,
Alfaro holds a weekly poetry workshop
in Detroit for high school students.
Based on what he's observed, Alfaro
noted that poetry is changing.
"It's starting to make this shift
towards more of a hip-hop platform
or a performance platform," he said.
"That aspect is what more young peo-
ple want to do.
"Poetry is going to be hard-hitting
and powerful - that you have to hear*
out loud. That's where it's going."
