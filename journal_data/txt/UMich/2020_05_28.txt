As the COVID-19 pandemic 
shutters businesses across the 
country, 
millions 
of 
people 
have been laid off, resulting in a 
historic surge in unemployment 
claims. On April 13, the state 
officially began accepting claims 
from 
previously 
ineligible 
workers, such as independent 
contractors, gig workers and 
self-employed people. Elizabeth 
Abdnour, 
a 
self-employed 
lawyer, applied that day under 
the new eligibility rules.
Two days later, Abdnour 
received four of the six letters 
she would get from the state 
disputing 
her 
filing. 
One 
dealt with confusion over her 
previous employer, Michigan 
State University, while two 
others focused on her status as 
a self-employed lawyer. 
All four letters contained the 
same warning regarding the 
penalty for wrongfully filing for 
unemployment.
“It 
is 
against 
state 
law 
to 
intentionally 
make 
false 
statements 
or 
conceal 
information to gain or avoid 
the payment of benefits,” the 

letters said. “You may have to 
repay up to 1.5 times the amount 
of benefits received … You may 
also be subject to criminal 
prosecution.”
Unemployment 
insurance 
helps people who have lost 
their jobs replace part of their 
wages while they look for 
work. In late March, Congress 
passed the Coronavirus Aid, 
Relief, and Economic Security 
(CARES) Act, which expanded 
the unemployment insurance 
system and gave states the 
option 
to 
offer 
Pandemic 
Unemployment Assistance to 
workers who were previously 
unqualified, including the self-
employed. The CARES Act also 
included a provision to provide 
an additional $600 per week 
to people collecting regular 
benefits.
On March 30, Gov. Gretchen 
Whitmer 
announced 
the 
expansion 
of 
unemployment 
insurance 
to 
self-employed 
people and other categories 
of workers. On April 10, the 
state 
released 
the 
opening 
date for filing applications: 
April 
13, 
when 
Michigan’s 
Unemployment 
Insurance 
Agency began accepting those 
claims at 8 a.m. 

However, creating an entirely 
new 
system 
of 
government 
benefits has not been easy, and 
some unemployed people, like 
Abdnour, have struggled to file 
claims. 
According to a request filed 
by The Daily under the Freedom 
of Information Act, since April 
10, the state has sent 251,884 
messages through its online 
unemployment 
application 
system and via physical mail 
with a “no employer selected” 
error 
to 
Michigan 
citizens 
who filed as self-employed. 
The state has also sent 14,136 
messages regarding what it 
claims are issues of intentional 
misrepresentation. 
Some 
people, 
including 
Abdnour, 
received multiple notices from 
the state over their claims.
As a lawyer, Abdnour said 
she occasionally deals with 
bureaucratic confusion. She said 
she wondered how someone 
who’s 
never 
been 
in 
this 
situation would react.
“The average person without 
legal training would probably 
be even more confused and 
scared 
because 
they 
aren’t 
experienced with the process

Self-employed in Michigan struggle 
with unemployment application

Design by Maggie Wiebe 

Trisha Vedula, Dublin Coffman High 
School junior, took the ACT multiple 
times and plans on submitting her score 
to schools, even if they are test optional. 
A lot of her peers, however, were waiting 
for the ACT school testing date,which 
is offered by the Ohio Department of 
Education but has been canceled due to 
COVID-19.
“I know U of M is a very, very good 
school. A lot of people in Ohio would be 
applying as it’s a really good school for 
them to get into,” Vedula said. “I know 
they’re also devastated by it because 
they almost feel like they wouldn’t get in 
— even if they meet other requirements 
— just because they haven’t taken the 
standardized test yet.”
Carly Cohen, Bloomfield Hills High 
School junior, was planning to retake 
the ACT in order to get a better score. 
However, with COVID-19 leading to 
standardized test dates being canceled, 
she’s not sure when, or if, she’ll get the 
chance. 
“It’s hard when a lot of schools 
around me are being test optional and 
Michigan’s not, and Michigan’s already 
a really difficult school to get into.” 
Cohen said.
The ACT Inc. is waiting until the 
week of May 26 to announce test center 
closures and cancellations for the June 
13 test date. Even so, according to its 
website, all testing is still subject to 
change up until the day of the exam.

supposed to be testing because I was

The University of Michigan’s 
Board of Regents held its third 
meeting of the year via Zoom on 
Thursday to approve recommend-
ed revisions to the Regents’ bylaws 
and address ongoing changes in 
University operations amid the 
COVID-19 
pandemic. 
Univer-
sity President Mark Schlissel said 
Regent Katherine White (D) was 
not present due to an assignment 
with the National Guard, but all 
other Regents and executive offi-
cers of the University attended. 
The meeting was live streamed on 
the University’s website and You-
Tube. 
The 
board 
unanimously 
approved changes to the bylaws 
concerning the dismissal, demo-
tion, termination and severance 
pay of tenured faculty. The chang-
es include refusal of severance pay 
in cases of alleged misconduct. 
Sally Churchill, vice president and 
secretary of the University, said 
the changes were reviewed by a 
group of nine professors from all 
three University campuses.
“The group was charged with 
furthering the University’s com-
mitment to upholding tenure; 
addressing egregious situations 
deserving of expedited proceed-
ings and interim measures; and 
reviewing and revising existing 
by law language,” Churchill said. 
“Decisions regarding the dis-
missal of tenured faculty within 
a reasonable time frame while 
respecting their due process rights 
are beneficial to both the faculty 
member and the University.”
The revisions come two months 
after David Daniels, a former 
Music, Theatre & Dance profes-
sor accused of sexual misconduct, 
was dismissed at the March Board 
of Regents meeting. Daniels had 
been on paid leave since sexual 
misconduct allegations against 
him surfaced in August 2018. The 
University began its official firing 
process in April 2019.

Schlissel noted the recom-
mendations were shared with the 
community and the board sought 
feedback for final revisions.
“The process for how we con-
sider the removal of tenure is 
one that cannot be taken lightly,” 
Schlissel said. “Tenure is essential 
for the integrity of the academic 
enterprise. I again thank everyone 
who has helped us develop these 
revisions to make us a better Uni-
versity.”
Schlissel commended the Uni-
versity for supporting the state 
of Michigan’s response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. He high-
lighted ongoing efforts in patient 
care, research and education that 
have helped the state save lives 
and develop an understanding of 
the effects of the pandemic. He 
noted several laboratory research 
programs 
resumed 
in-person 
activities on Wednesday in accor-
dance with Michigan Gov. Gretch-
en Whitmer’s executive order 
2020-90. 
Schlissel reiterated the Univer-
sity is still developing a plan for 
the upcoming semester, but he said 
he was hopeful it would be pos-
sible to offer in-person instruction 
on campus.
“The University of Michigan 
will look very different in the 
months ahead than what we’ve 
become accustomed to, but I am 
optimistic 
about 
our 
future,” 
Schlissel said. “The planning tak-
ing place at all levels of our Uni-
versity to adjust on how we deliver 
on our mission is thorough and 
impressive. This includes our 
preparations for the fall as we 
hope to be able to deliver a pub-
lic health-informed fall semester 
with a mix of in-person and online 
instruction on our campuses.”
Schlissel took a moment before 
addressing items on the agenda to 
offer his condolences to those who 
have been affected by extreme 
flooding in Midland County on 
Wednesday.
“I want to express my sympa-
thy to the thousands of Michigan-
ders affected by the flooding in 
Midland and in nearby communi-
ties,” Schlissel said. “The disaster 
comes at a time when residents

Alternative academic 
plans increase amid fall 
semester uncertainty

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, 
incoming students who would 
normally head off to the University of 
Michigan in the fall are considering 
alternative 
plans. 
Gap 
years, 
internship pursuals, community 
college classes and other options 
are now relevant as plans for remote 
learning develop, multiple students 
told The Daily. While the University 
is in the process of planning a “public 
health-informed” semester, the fate 
of fall semester is still uncertain. 
Many other universities have either 
canceled 
in-person 
instruction 
completely or are planning for an 
accelerated first semester to avoid 
the possible second COVID-19 peak. 
Incoming Music, Theatre & 
Dance freshman Lucy McDowell is 
from the suburbs of Chicago and has 
officially deferred her acceptance 
for the upcoming school year. As a 
music major, McDowell explained 
how her decision revolved around 
the value of in-person classes, given 
how 
group-focused 
her 
music 
classes would be. 
“A big part of your music 
education comes from ensemble 
work, and if you’re supposed to be 
in a choir with 100 or more kids, it’s 
difficult to make that happen over 
Zoom or recordings,” McDowell 
said. “It just doesn’t have the same 
connection or outcome. You just 

don’t get to have that personal 
connection with your professors, 
which is hard to do over the internet 
because it’s a really isolating 
experience.”
Similarly, 
Ian 
Pathak, 
an 
incoming Music, Theatre & Dance 
freshman from Virginia, has also 
considered taking a gap year given 
the uncertainty of in-person classes. 
Pathak explained the many factors 
influencing his decision, including 
tuition 
costs 
for 
out-of-state 
students. 
“The only problem is the financial 
aspect of being an out-of-state 
student and taking remote classes,” 
Pathak said. “It’s already expensive 
for me to pay going there full on. 
And room and board and meal does 
take part of it off, but tuition still 
remains the same.”
Current 
students 
across 
the 
University 
shared 
similar 
sentiments with Pathak, unsure 
if full tuition for remote classes is 
worth the cost. LSA junior Sam 
Burnstein said the transition from 
in-class lectures to Zoom classes 
revealed the diminished quality of 
remote learning. 
“What we’re paying for are a 
couple things: a slide deck and 
30, 40, maybe 50 hours of video,” 
Burnstein said. “Both of those 
things can be acquired very easily 
online for free — it’s becoming 
incredibly clear that we’re paying 
for the degree. We’re paying for 
the certification. This was already 
clear before classes went online, and 
I think going online made things

Regents alter policy
for faculty tenure


As University of Michigan stu-

dents wait to hear whether their 
fall term will be online, in-person 
or some combination of the two 
University President Mark Schlis-
sel predicts that whatever deci-
sion is made regarding classes will 
likely last through the academic 
year, not just for fall semester. In 
an interview with the Wall Street 
Journal, Schlissel discussed mak-
ing the call on whether classes are 
online or in person for the follow-
ing school year. 

“Any decision we make for this 

coming fall is likely going to be the 
case for the whole academic year,” 
Schlissel said. “What’s going to be 
different in January?” 

Schlissel, an immunologist by 

training, pointed out that the win-
ter semester comes with public 
health concerns as well and with 
COVID-19, those months could 
be worse due to the flu season. 
Roughly half of University stu-
dents are from out of state, which 
means both semesters will be 
marked with an influx of travel 
from COVID-19 hotspots.

Schlissel said his leadership 

team is working to lower the risk 
of COVID-19 for students and staff 
so it is indistinguishable from the 
risk at home. According to him, the 
school may consider quarantining 
some people upon their arrival to 
campus, along with widespread 
symptom screening, testing, social 
distancing and using personal pro-
tective equipment. 

Schools nationwide are taking a 

variety of approaches. For exam-
ple, the California State Univer-
sity system announced that their 
fall term will be mainly online and 
University of Notre Dame is plan-
ning to start the fall term early to 
end before Thanksgiving. Howev-
er, Schlissel warned that the more 
promising announcements from 
other institutions are still subject 

to approval by local officials.

“I don’t want to set false expec-

tations,” 
Schlissel 
said. 
“(The 

announcements are) really not as 
declarative as they appear.” 

The interview came days after 

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer 
relaxed the stay-at-home order, 
which was extended to June 12, to 
allow groups of less than ten peo-
ple to congregate in one location. 

The NCAA voted a few days 

prior to allow voluntary foot-
ball and basketball workouts to 
resume starting on June 1, and 
while other schools have plans to 
bring back football players for vol-
untary training, Michigan has not 
announced any sort of plan yet. 
According to Schlissel, the Univer-
sity won’t have a football season in 
the fall unless all students are able 
to be back on campus for classes. 

“If there is no on-campus 

instruction then there won’t be 
intercollegiate athletics, at least 
for Michigan,” Schlissel said. “(I 
have) some degree of doubt as to 
whether there will be college ath-
letics (anywhere), at least in the 
fall.”

Schlissel added that Michigan 

is in a better position than other 
universities to take the revenue 
loss from not having a football 
season. The athletic department’s 
budget last season was $185 mil-
lion, and about $83 million –– 43% 
of the athletic department’s rev-
enue –– came from football last 
year, according to the Wall Street 
Journal. 

“Although trouble in a $185 mil-

lion unit is a big deal, it isn’t of the 
scale that it threatens the univer-
sity,” Schlissel said.

Schlissel said he expects to 

make the decision for how the 
upcoming academic year functions 
in the coming weeks.

Thesis defense has tradition-

ally been one of the final and most 
important steps for master’s and 
doctoral students to obtain their 
degrees. However, due to the 
restrictions on in-person events 
as part of the effort to combat 
the spread of COVID-19, thesis 
defenses are now being held virtu-
ally, forcing students and faculty 
to adjust to the new format. 

John Godfrey, Rackham Gradu-

ate School assistant dean, com-
mented on the difficult challenge 
of making swift and effective 
adjustments in reaction to the 
pandemic. 

“Moving our operations online 

was a major challenge,” God-
frey said. “Rackham staff were 
working remotely and the pace of 
work has not stopped because of 
COVID. There have been students 
continuing their defense and get-
ting their degrees. We had to do 
many things from adjusting pol-
icy, to accommodating students, 
to assessing financial needs of the 
students.”

Godfrey explained how a lot 

of effort has gone into ensuring a 
smooth transition to the virtual 
format since one of the school’s 
primary functions is to facilitate 
dissertation and thesis defenses.

“Rackham’s 
major 
role 
is 

in 
administering 
dissertation 

defenses,” Godfrey said. “We have 
had 185, maybe close to 200 dis-
sertation defenses that have taken 
place online since instructions 
ended on campus. It appears that 
it’s going fairly seamlessly.”

Rackham student Amy-Char-

lotte Devitz stated one of the big-
gest challenges she faced was the 
lack of audience feedback. 

“I think the biggest challenge 

is that you lose the ability to kind 
of get that audience feedback 
when you are presenting,” Devitz 
said. “Because the program I was 
using, on your screen you can 
only see your slides, and obvi-
ously you need that to be able to 
present properly, but you can’t see 
the audience and you can’t really 
gauge their reactions. It’s hard to 
read the room.”

Engineering Ph.D. candidate 

Kevin Hughes said the process 
of defending his thesis remained 
largely unchanged for him, with 
the biggest challenge being equip-
ment and hardware preparations 
beforehand. 

“In general, BlueJeans was fair-

ly good,” Hughes said. “One chal-
lenge was actually I moved during 
this process. My wife and I moved 

to where we are going to be work-
ing in Minnesota, which brought 
up a few challenges, which include 
getting a reliable internet connec-
tion setup, the purchase of cable, 
better quality microphone. I did a 
few practice sessions beforehand 
just to troubleshoot the connec-
tion and audio quality issues.” 

Godfrey believed the new vir-

tual format has many benefits, 
including more flexibility and 
ease to implement accommoda-
tions, but also said it takes away 
the celebratory and ceremonial 
aspect of it. 

“In shifting to virtual, I think 

it may be easier to schedule the 
defense,” Godfrey said. “Normal-
ly, you had to have people all show 
up to the same building at the 
same time and sometimes it can 
be a little tricky. It may have, at 
the end, proven to be more accom-
modating. But it certainly takes 
away the celebratory aspect, like 
the reception afterwards where 
people congratulate the person 
who just finished their defense.”

Hughes said a virtual thesis 

defense raised concerns over pri-
vacy since more people can join.

“I had a larger audience than 

I would have had in Michigan,” 
Hughes said. “For instance, my 
sister, she just had a baby so she 
wouldn’t have been able to come

public-health informed, hybrid format of learning

Ph.D. candidates talk 
pros, cons of transition 

to online platform


A

ssuming all things go as 
planned without any exten-
sions, Gov. Gretchen Whit-

mer’s COVID-19 stay-at-home order 
is set to end at 11:59 pm on June 12, 
with certain industries such as auto 
manufacturers being allowed to 
partially reopen before then. This 
extension is part of a carefully cre-
ated protocol, known as MI Safe 
Start, which gradually eases stay-at-
home restrictions based on how well 
COVID-19 cases are decreasing in the 
state. While Whitmer’s COVID-19 
response has been lauded as an effec-
tive way to enforce social distancing 
after the state reopens fully with-
out conditions, many of Michigan’s 
workers will face the harsh economic 
realities that being away from work 
has inflicted upon them. 

While Whitmer’s most recent 

order allows for manufacturing 
workers specifically to go back to 
work despite the stay-at-home exten-
sions, more needs to be done so job 
holders in all fields can see some 
degree of security. In order to make 
sure that Michigan’s economy does 
not tank in a manner consistent 
with the sustained high unemploy-
ment and homelessness of the Great 
Depression and the Great Recession, 
the state government should boost 
spending 
significantly, 
preparing 

businesses to keep the workers they 
already employ and making sure ten-
ants can pay rent without fear of evic-
tion.

For many Americans in Michigan 

and elsewhere, working from home is 
simply not an option. Including din-
ing staff, salespeople at non-essential 

businesses like malls and department 
stores and other industries, many 
people are losing their jobs because 
they are not allowed to report to work 
due to stay-at-home orders. People 
are also losing their jobs because busi-
ness revenues have plummeted due to 
stay-at-home orders. Naturally, this 
causes unemployment to rise dra-
matically. Many have also resigned 
to avoid contracting COVID-19.

While there are reports of hun-

dreds or even thousands of firms 
hiring workers in Michigan right 
now, these numbers are quite decep-
tive as these businesses are in spe-
cific fields, like healthcare, which 
do not cover all of the newly unem-
ployed. With regards to Michigan 
specifically, the state’s unemploy-
ment numbers exceeded 1 million 
workers filing for unemployment 
benefits, which is around 21 percent 
of the state’s workforce. This is up 
from 180,000 people filing for ben-
efits before the COVID-19 outbreak, 
a rate of about 4.3 percent. This is a 
level not seen since the Great Depres-
sion and made Michigan the state 
with one of the highest unemploy-
ment rates (8 percent above average) 
in the country. While it is entirely 
possible that many of these jobs will 
return once the economy reopens 
and businesses have in-person con-
sumers, many establishments have 
gone out of business due to the afore-
mentioned lack of revenue. 

In Michigan’s restaurant industry 

alone, approximately 10 percent of 
all restaurants in the state may have 
closed permanently (precise hard 
data is difficult to come by given the 

pandemic) in the month of April. To 
this end, Michigan legislators like 
U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens, D-Mich., 
have supported and co-sponsored 
legislation such as the Essential 
Worker Protection Act, which calls 
for a federal interagency task force 
overseen by Cabinet members and 
other high-level officials to super-
vise federal support of newly unem-
ployed manufacturing workers in 
Michigan. This task force would also 
supervise the allocation of credit to 
businesses to make sure they, and 
the jobs they provide, stay afloat 
during this crisis. 

Although Whitmer does not have 

the individual power to authorize 
this level of financial oversight, 
working with the state legislature 
to pass appropriations boosting the 
funding already being considered at 
the federal level would be an ideal 
pathway to building a financial 
safety net not just for manufactur-
ers, but for all industries who need 
the money to keep their workers 
employed. This will help ensure 
an improved level of employment 
growth and stability that can be sus-
tained after Michigan is reopened.

Even though Michigan’s govern-

ment temporarily halted evictions 
for failing to pay rent with a March 
executive order from Whitmer, 
those who owe rent will be hit with 
those bills the state reopens, even if 
they don’t have a job yet.

Whitmer’s exit plan is key to Michigan’s recovery

P

residential nominees consider 
a smorgasbord of factors when 
mulling the vice-presidential 

nomination question. Could the person 
step into my shoes and effectively gov-
ern? Will the person excite the party 
base and get it to the polls? Is the person 
popular among independents and mod-
erates? Does the person have national 
name recognition? Is the person a fun-
draising machine? Do I like and can I 
work with the person? Does the person 
have skeletons in the closet or severed 
heads in the freezer? 

There is one additional vital question: 

Will the selection adversely alter the bal-
ance of power in the United States Sen-
ate? 

Typically, the answer is no. But when 

it’s not, when either it’s a yes or a maybe, 
the hopes of that aspiring nominee are 
usually dashed instantly. For this rea-
son, many folks have discounted the 
possibility that former Vice President 
Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic 
presidential nominee, will pick Sen. Eliz-
abeth Warren, D-Mass., for the Demo-
cratic VP spot. In the 2020 elections, the 
Democrats could retake control of the 
Senate and Massachusetts has a Repub-
lican governor, who would appoint her 
replacement. So why would the Demo-
crats make retaking the Senate even 
harder for themselves? 

For Warren, the calculation is more 

nuanced. And if Biden does want to run 
with her, he can ignore the “maybe” 
answer to the question, as long as War-
ren files her Senate resignation by June 
23, 2020. 

Let me explain. Each state decides, 

via its election laws, how a U.S. Sen-
ate vacancy gets filled. In one group 
of states, the sitting governor appoints 
someone to serve until the end of the 
vacating senator’s term. In a second 
group, the governor makes an interim 
appointment until a special election. A 
third group of states fully circumvents 
the governor and holds a special election 
to fill the vacancy.

Since 2004, Massachusetts has fallen 

into the second category. Before that, 
Massachusetts fell into the first catego-
ry. Why the change? Because in 2004, 
the Democratic Party nominated former 
Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., for presi-
dent. If Kerry had won, he would have 
resigned his Senate seat, precipitating 
the appointment of his successor by the 
sitting Republican Gov. Mitt Romney. 
Prior to the 2004 election, the Senate had 
51 Republicans and 48 Democrats (plus 
one independent, who caucused with 
the Democrats) — which meant every 
seat mattered. But Kerry lost, returned 
to the Senate, the Democrats lost a net of 
four Senate seats and the law change had 
no effect until five years later.

In August 2009, Sen. Ted Kennedy, 

D-Mass., passed away. At that time, the 

Democrats held a 60-vote, filibuster-
proof majority in the Senate (thanks 
to former Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., 
switching parties in April 2009 and 
former Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., ulti-
mately winning the Minnesota Senate 
seat in July 2009). Then Democratic 
governor of Massachusetts, Deval 
Patrick, appointed an interim senator, 
Democrat Paul Kirk, to serve until the 
February 2010 special election, which 
Republican Scott Brown won, busting 
the Democrats’ filibuster-proof major-
ity, which the Democrats have not 
recovered from since. 

Karma is a … well, we all know what 

karma is. 

Senate vacancies can matter, which 

is why presidential nominees consider 
them. House vacancies don’t matter 
because… well, presidential nominees 
rarely pick a House member for VP 
and because vacant House seats are 
filled via special election per Article I, 
Section 2 of the Constitution. Sure, one 
seat might flip the House. But in recent 
history, since the 63rd Congress in 1913 
when the number of representatives 
increased to 435, a one-member party 
change could only have flipped the 
House during two Congresses (in the 
65th Congress between 1917 and 1919 
and at various points in the 72nd Con-
gress between 1931 and 1933).

Since 1932, presidential nominees 

have chosen a sitting U.S. Senator as run-
ning mate 18 times.

Only two of these running mates 

represented a state that had a governor 
of the opposing party: 1988 Democratic 
VP nominee Lloyd Bentsen, a senator 
from Texas — of “Jack Kennedy was a 
friend of mine. Senator, you’re no Jack 
Kennedy” fame — and 2000 Demo-
cratic VP nominee Joe Lieberman, a 
senator from Connecticut. In 1988, the 
Democrats held a +10 seat advantage 
in the Senate. Though the Democratic 
presidential nominee, former Mas-
sachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, still 
should not have risked losing a Demo-
cratic Senate seat. In 2000, Republi-
cans held a +10 seat advantage, but the 
election netted the Democrats five 
seats, which evenly split the Senate. 
Had Al Gore won the presidency, his 
vice presidential nominee, then Sen. 
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., would 
have resigned his Senate seat, leaving 
the Republican Connecticut governor 
to appoint a Republican to replace him 
(at least until a low turnout special elec-
tion with an uncertain outcome). 

Elizabeth Warren must resign

A

s COVID-19 continues to run its 
course across the United States, 
there are few aspects of Ameri-
can life that have avoided this pandemic’s 
disastrous impact. 
According to medical data compiled by 
Johns Hopkins University, over 100,000 
Americans have succumbed to COVID-19. 
At the same time, the Institute for Health 
Metrics and Evaluation at the University of 
Washington projects that our nation will 
see over 130,000 deaths by early August 
as states begin to relax social distancing 
measures.
While the deaths from COVID-19 con-
tinue to mount, the economic carnage 
from shutdowns aimed at stopping the 
spread of COVID-19 is unprecedented in 
modern American history. According to 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the national 
unemployment rate has skyrocketed to 
nearly 15 percent, with the economy slash-
ing over 20 million jobs in April alone. 
Meanwhile, J.P. Morgan Chief Invest-
ment Officer Bob Michele predicted that 
our economy may not reach the levels of 
employment we enjoyed before the pan-
demic for 10-12 years.
But as thousands of Americans lose 
their lives to COVID-19 — and millions 
more forfeit their livelihoods — another, 
more subtle level of loss is rippling across 
the nation. It’s become clear that as this 
global pandemic continues to threaten 
people’s lives and our economy, our essen-
tial and celebrated freedoms as Americans 
are coming under increasing fire. 
Since governors across the nation have 
imposed stay-at-home orders in an effort 
to “flatten the curve,” our country has wit-
nessed a slew of disturbing civil liberties 
violations that seemed unthinkable before 
COVID-19 turned life upside down. While 
it’s perfectly reasonable — and necessary 
— to expect changes to our daily lives in 
trying times like these, it seems that people 
across the nation have forgotten that our 
freedoms are never put on hold, even in the 
midst of crises. It’s clear our government 
has gone too far.
While COVID-19 continues to undoubt-
edly be a formidable threat, leaders have 
gone to unacceptable, sickening lengths 
to enforce government-mandated social 
distancing, threatening arrests and even 
jail time for violating stay-at-home orders. 
(Meanwhile, the stay-at-home orders 
themselves have come under scrutiny as 
Americans question how constitutional 
they really are.) In Dallas, Texas, a judge 
sent Shelley Luther, a salon owner, to jail 
for reopening her business and defying 
the stay-at-home order; Luther was called 
“selfish” in court even as she argued that 
she had no choice, saying her children 
were going hungry. After shock across the 
state, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott prohibited 
jail time for those who violate social dis-
tancing, freeing Luther.

Similar scenes are playing out across 
the country. In Philadelphia, PA., police 
violently removed a man from a bus for 
not wearing a face covering. Others have 
been fined or arrested for simply ventur-
ing outside for a walk or exercise. While 
this excessive, dangerous enforcement 
of social distancing is threatening for all 
Americans, the New York Times reports 
that people of color are being dispropor-
tionately arrested in particular. 
Beyond these incidents, it’s clear that 
our freedoms have been violated in count-
less other ways as well. For instance, 
Americans have been barred from visiting 
places of worship like churches and syna-
gogues to exercise their freedom of reli-
gion, which meant that, for example, most 
Christians couldn’t go to church on Easter, 
their holiest day of the year. Meanwhile, in 
our criminal justice system, although the 
Constitution gives the accused the right 
to a speedy trial, a number of defendants 
have been forced to sit longer in jail as 
trial dates are pushed back. According to a 
recent article in the Lansing State Journal, 
“For defendants who are not in custody, 
the delay likely is an inconvenience. But for 
those in the county jail, the shutdown is an 
extra month — or more — that they have to 
wait for justice.” Moreover, governments 
across the country now openly discuss 
implementing advanced contact tracing 
and surveillance programs to help curb 
COVID-19, even though these programs 
would clearly infringe on our freedoms 
and privacy rights.
In addition to these civil liberties vio-
lations, the rhetoric of politicians and 
leaders across the country is downright 
disturbing. In New York City, Mayor Bill 
de Blasio suggested that New Yorkers 
turn in those that are breaking social-
distancing rules to the city, a move that 
some Americans quickly denounced as 
“communist.” In Chicago, Mayor Lori 
Lightfoot told residents that they would 
be treated like criminals if they didn’t 
follow social distancing regulations, say-
ing, “We will shut you down, we will 
cite you, and if we have to, we will arrest 
you.” Lightfoot continued, “Don’t make 
us treat you like a criminal, but if you act 
like a criminal and you violate the law and 
refuse to do what’s necessary to save lives 
in the middle of a pandemic, we will take 
you to jail. Period.” It is understandable 
that New York and Chicago — along with 
a number of other hard-hit cities — are 
continuously grappling with how to deal 
with COVID-19, but there is a way to curb 
the spread of COVID-19 without such bla-
tant disregard for our precious freedoms 
that we all celebrate as Americans.

Don’t let COVID tread on our freedoms

ZACK BLUMBERG | OP-ED

F

rom the end of World War 
II through the present day, 
the United States has main-
tained a position as the world’s pre-
mier superpower. For decades, the 
American values of hard work, indi-
vidualism, liberalism and free-mar-
ket capitalism appeared to lead to 
massive successes, including tech-
nological advancement, economic 
prosperity and high standards of 
living. However, as COVID-19 has 
exposed, the values which people 
once associated with America’s 
brand of strength and prosperity 
now appear antiquated and out-
dated and are ultimately holding the 
U.S. back. While countries around 
the world have responded to the 
virus in different ways, American 
society’s fundamental focus on indi-
vidualism, freedom and economic 
growth have exposed the inequal-
ity, distrust of government institu-
tions and lack of protections for 
vulnerable populations within our 
country. 
First and foremost, the spread of 
COVID-19 has highlighted Ameri-
ca’s extreme inequality, something 
which is largely a product of Ameri-
can society’s fanatical devotion to 
economic growth. As economist 
Milton Friedman declared in a 
1970 New York Times Magazine 
article, “The Social Responsibility 
of Business is to Increase its Prof-
its.” In the decades since Friedman’s 
article was published, it’s clear that 
America has taken his advice to 
heart. Today, the U.S. has 10 of the 
world’s 20 most profitable compa-
nies, but at a cost: It also ranks 39th 
worst in income inequality, worse 
than countries such as Angola, the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo 
and Turkmenistan. Last year, a 
study found that nearly 60 percent 
of Americans had less than $1,000 
in their bank accounts, another 
sign of America’s staggering income 
inequality. 
Unsurprisingly, America’s focus 
on profits, and its acceptance of the 
inequalities that philosophy inher-
ently produces, has greatly con-
tributed to the nation’s disastrous 
response to COVID-19. On April 21, 
a day on which over 2,600 Ameri-
cans died of the virus, Texas Lt. 
Gov. Dan Patrick said that “there 
are more important things than liv-
ing and that’s saving this country.” 
Similarly, former New Jersey Gov. 
Chris Christie commented, “there 
are going to be deaths no matter 
what,” but “we have to stand up for 
the American way of life.” In saying 
this, Christie clearly implied that 

the American way of life is primar-
ily focused on economic growth 
— inequality and public health be 
damned. When faced with skyrock-
eting unemployment rates, the U.S. 
Congress was both unwilling and 
unable to come up with an econom-
ic solution that addressed America’s 
income inequality. Although the 
federal government ultimately sent 
out a one-time $1,200 stimulus 
check to citizens, by April 23, only 
10 days after the first checks were 
deposited, 84 percent of Americans 
said they already needed another 
check to make ends meet. That fed-
eral relief bill, which cost over $2 
trillion in total, simply proved how 
unassailable American inequality 
has become. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has 
also revealed the problems with the 
American society’s support of free-
market capitalism, as workers often 
find themselves under-protected 
and devoid of rights. Although there 
has consistently been some opposi-
tion to America’s overly laissez-faire 
attitude — such as Upton Sinclar’s 
1906 novel “The Jungle” — support 
for deregulation and limited gov-
ernment oversight of the private 
sector is a major component of both 
America’s society and economy. 
As of 2015, American employees 
worked an average of 1,779 hours per 
year, the seventh most of any nation 
globally. Additionally, American 
workers often have far less nego-
tiating power with their employ-
ers than their global counterparts: 
only 10.6 percent of Americans are 
part of labor unions, far lower than 
countries of comparable wealth and 
development such as the U.K. (24.7 
percent), Canada (26.5 percent) and 
Germany (17.7 percent). 
COVID-19 has exposed the fun-
damental flaws of this anti-regula-
tory attitude, showing the danger 
of limiting workers’ rights in favor 
of supporting businesses. A quar-
ter of U.S. workers have no paid 
sick leave, meaning many essen-
tial workers face a difficult choice: 
do they go into work and risk get-
ting themselves or others sick, or 
do they stay home and risk getting 
fired, losing essential benefits such 
as healthcare? Even when workers 
have attempted to demand better 
treatment in response to the virus, 
the power imbalance between them 
and their employers makes this an 
impossible battle: On March 30, 
Amazon fired an employee who had 
planned to lead a strike demand-
ing 
safer 
working 
conditions. 
Ultimately, America’s support for 

businesses has hamstrung work-
ers’ ability to receive the protections 
they deserve, leading to preventable 
deaths.
American society’s individualism 
and distrust of government institu-
tions have worsened the COVID-
19 crisis, creating an atmosphere 
in which necessary measures are 
seen by some as totalitarian attacks 
on freedom and liberty. Across the 
country, protestors have come out 
to defend their self-proclaimed 
rights to things such as haircuts, 
believing that the government’s 
stay-at-home orders infringe upon 
their personal liberties. While other 
countries’ citizens appear to under-
stand the importance of deferring to 
public health experts in the name 
of safety, the American ethos of 
individualism appears to include 
defending one’s right to contracting 
the virus. More broadly, this rep-
resents American society’s funda-
mental distrust of government: At 
a time when trusting institutions is 
essential for a cohesive response to 
a deadly virus, some Americans are 
unwilling to put aside their personal 
biases for the communal well-being.
This focus on individual liber-
ties above all else is also apparent in 
the federal government’s response 
to the pandemic. In comparison 
to America’s constant concerns 
about creating too extensive a wel-
fare system, which has limited the 
federal government’s willingness 
to intervene, other countries have 
taken much more comprehensive 
responses: Canada’s plan includes 
C$2,000 stimulus checks for four 
months, while Denmark’s govern-
ment “agreed to cover the cost of 
employees’ salaries at private com-
panies as long as those companies 
do not fire people,” effectively freez-
ing the Danish economy until after 
the worst of the virus has passed. 
In conclusion, COVID-19 has 
exposed a bevy of problems with 
the once-fabled American value sys-
tem, showing the downsides to the 
tenets which had previously been 
associated with creating the world’s 
wealthiest nation. Today, those same 
values of free-market economics 
and individual rights are responsible 
for America’s inhumane response 
to the pandemic and have laid bare 
the deep-rooted inequalities, weak 
worker protections and unwilling-
ness to sacrifice for the greater good.

A ‘New Horizons’ diary

The music that plays at 5 a.m. in 
“Animal Crossing: New Horizons” is 
beautiful. I’ve only heard it in-game 
once. Not because I’m some Fortune 
500 freak who thinks waking up at 
the ass crack of dawn is the key to 
success, or because I woke up in the 
middle of the night and booted up the 
game because I couldn’t go to sleep. 
No. Because I had been playing “Ani-
mal Crossing” for about three hours 
through the dead of night, planning 
and landscaping and building a dis-
count Versailles hedge maze on my 
island.
I was so into this little project that 
I lost track of time, only to be slapped 
with a reminder when the Town Hall’s 
bells tolled at the top of the hour. 
Although time in “Animal Crossing” is 
synced up with time in the real world, 
the day doesn’t officially start anew 
until the clock strikes 5 a.m. You’re 
momentarily frozen and thrown into 
a loading screen to watch the daily 
announcements from the series favor-
ite shih tzu Isabelle, which I usually see 
after rolling out of bed around 2 p.m. 
The soundtrack greets you kindly once 
you regain control of your character. It 
mirrors the soft sound of ocean waves 
rolling in on your island’s beaches and 
the morning blue-green sky. It’s beau-
tiful, and I never want to hear it again.
***
Oh, “Animal Crossing: New Hori-
zons,” there was a time when I thought 
you would be the one to fix my life.
After a year’s worth of intensifying 
depression, mounting attention issues, 
dropped classes, exhausting jobs and 
dealing with all the shit life throws at 
you post-coming out as a trans woman, 
I thought 2020 was going to be the year 

where I got my life back on track. I was 
going to commit to school, get a stable 
and decent source of income, pursue 
my hobbies, be the best I could for my 
friends. “Animal Crossing” was going 
to be the reward for a life well lived, 
almost poetically placed in mid-March 
as the semester really started to ramp 
up. I would live each day to the fullest, 
and treat myself by paling around on 
my island paradise for 30 minutes or so 
before a dutiful 11 p.m. bedtime.
It hardly lasted a month. I burnt 
through the two or three free absences 
in all my classes, and skipped some 
more. I forgot to complete an earth sci-
ence online exam worth a third of my 
grade before the deadline. I processed 
the terse term withdrawal paperwork 
for the second time in my University 
of Michigan career. I held back tears 
in the lobby of the Office of Financial 
Aid as I wondered if I had fucked my 
scholarship for good. I stayed in bed 
too much, and ate too little. Suffice to 
say, it sucked.
Oh, “Animal Crossing: New Hori-
zons,” there was a time when I thought 
you would be the one to fix our lives.
The way it all went to shit was kind 
of funny, I guess. Spring Break was 
almost over, and Bernie Sanders was 
holding a rally in Ann Arbor. The sheer 
volume of people crammed into the 
fenced-off Diag was electric on that 
Sunday afternoon, but mortifying to 
recontextualize now two months later. 
I voted for Bernie in the primary that 
Tuesday, and that night I was grinding 
“Super Smash Bros. Ultimate” with 
my friends only to read the news that 
he had inexplicably lost every county 
in Michigan to Joe Fucking Biden. Oh 
yeah, and the first cases of COVID-19 
had been confirmed in Michigan.
You know, Coronavirus, That Thing 
That Had Been Happening In China 
But All Things Considered Will Prob-

ably Not Be A Big Deal In America. Or 
at least, that’s the picture I got from 
the Trump administration mouth-
pieces who were broadcasted on the 
nightly news, which I only ever caught 
if it was on the TV in the dining hall’s 
break room. I would aimlessly listen 
to them proclaiming the situation was 
under control, not thinking much of it 
while chewing on undercooked noo-
dles before I got back to my shift. But 
there I was, sitting in the game room 
of a fancy apartment building, about 
to realize that This Thing Was Quickly 
Going To Be A Big Deal. The Univer-
sity cancelled classes swiftly after the 
news came out, and soon enough the 
entire campus was shut down and my 
job with it.
It seemed like almost all my friends 
in Ann Arbor were gone within the 
following week, graduating seniors 
realizing they had sat in for their last 
physical class without even realizing it. 
I was left in this void of an apartment 
I once thought of comfortably as my 
home, with no loving family to retreat 
to and only my girlfriend to help main-
tain my sanity.
But hey, at least “Animal Crossing” 
was around the corner! In the first 
week of quarantine my Twitter time-
line was practically clamoring for it, 
lamenting the quarantine but acknowl-
edging that the game perhaps couldn’t 
come at a more apt time. A few days 
before release some fans who have 
probably never known real struggle in 
their life were even sharing an oh-so-
polite letter to Nintendo pleading with 
the company to welease their wittle 
funny animal game eawly. “Animal 
Crossing” would arrive on the wings 
of an angel to help ease the whiplash 
from all this sudden imposed isolation, 
convince us that maybe staying inside 
ain’t all that bad when we have cute 
and cozy video games to tide us over.

Oh, “Animal Crossing: New Hori-
zons,” there was a time when I thought 
you would be the one to fix it all. And 
oh, how wrong I was.
***
First impressions were promising. 
With past games in the series, all there 
is to do upon startup is complete some 
menial tasks for the omnipotent and 
contentious Tom Nook as you start to 
pay off your initial home loan. After 
about 30 minutes, the game starts to 
open up and you can play it however 
you want: Some would turn the game 
off satisfied and pick up where the 
game left off the next day, while oth-
ers would “time travel” by manually 
pushing their system clock forward 
and speed through days to cut down 
the wait on new items, shop upgrades, 
monthly events and the like.
“New Horizons” takes that thirty 
minutes of initial questing and beefs it 
up into something resembling a story, 
with the goal of making your island a 
vacation hotspot, which takes about 
two week’s worth of in-game days to 
complete. My girlfriend and I had the 
game preloaded on our Switches so 
we could play at midnight on March 
20, and we stayed up until about four 
in the morning floored by how fun and 
engaging the new crafting features 
and “Nook Miles” achievement-track-
ing system were compared to the first 
couple hours of past games.
We played in real time, so over the 
next week, we crafted cute little out-
door spaces for new villagers, built a 
shop for the Nook’s adorable appren-
tices Timmy and Tommy and upgrad-
ed the cramped Resident Services tent 
into a modern Town Hall. We laughed 
at the memes on Twitter about how 
you could get rich by catching taran-
tulas or how people stockpiled their 
island with bugs and fish waiting for 
the museum to open and its curator 
Blathers to start taking donations. 
“Animal Crossing: New Horizons” 
seemed like the rare case of a video 
game being the target of incredible 
hype yet still managing to stick the 
landing on arrival.
Or was it too good to be true? After 
your island achieves a three star rat-
ing and the vagabond musician and 
series staple K. K. Slider comes to play 
a concert, Tom Nook finally gives you 
access to the much-anticipated terra-
forming features. Your entire island’s 
layout is now able to be modified to 
your liking, and with the right items 
you can entertain the possibility of 
urban side streets, medieval castles or 
even covering every possible inch of 
your island in water.
I mentioned before that it seemed 
like everyone and their mother was 
hankering to play “Animal Crossing: 
New Horizons,” and the numbers 
don’t lie: The game sold more than 

13 million copies in the first month 
or so, which is already more than the 
last entry in the series, “New Leaf,” 
sold in its entire lifetime. And since 
everyone is cooped up at home, and 
everyone has more time to waste on 
the internet, “Animal Crossing” has 
evolved from a popular but more 
niche life-simulator with communi-
ties housed on Reddit and Tumblr, to 
a mainstream trending topic that will 
pop up on your Facebook and Twitter 
feeds even if you don’t play the game. 
There were articles about how people 
were hosting birthday parties, gradu-
ation ceremonies and even work-
place meetings on their islands. The 
Detroit Lions underpaid an intern to 
make a seven minute video revealing 
their 2020 schedule using the game’s 
robust customization features and a 
little Photoshop.
It seems like an unwritten Internet 
rule that the more popular a piece of 
media becomes the more cutthroat 
and vocal its fans are. With “New Hori-
zons” the gatekeepers were on guard 
day one, as a war was waged between 
time travellers who wanted to make 
their island look as cool as possible as 
fast as possible and so-called “purists” 
who decried anything beyond taking 
the game one day at a time as “cheat-
ing.” Although I was an avid time trav-
eller in past games, I wanted to take 
the game slowly this time, especially 
since it would give me at least a tiny 
bit of structure as the vacuous days of 
quarantine began to morph together. 
No problem, right? Twitter told a dif-
ferent story. The purists labelled the 
time travellers as impatient babies 
who sucked all the fun out of the 
game. The time travellers brushed off 
the purists as the fun-police who were 
jealous of what they were already able 
to accomplish.
Regardless of the yelling, by the 
time I unlocked terraforming and 
could finally catch up to the time 
travellers the game started to feel 
more and more like a chore. Why 
even bother trying to make a grand 
outdoor entrance for my museum or 
a high-octane boxing ring when five 
other people on Twitter have already 
done it? For a game centered around 
themes of leisure and community, it’s 
amazing how toxic and selfish some 
of its fans had become. People would 
bully others for “stealing” their ideas 
for island design or charge ridiculous 
prices for the game’s rare items on 
the ironically-named online fan mar-
ketplace Nookazon. The concept of 
cheating in “Animal Crossing” is a silly 
oxymoron at best, but people were try-
ing their damndest to make it a com-
petition.

A relationship’s “spark” is an abstract con-
cept that we love to talk about. Whether it’s 
the reason someone might want to break up 
or it’s why we aren’t going on that second Tin-
der date, the world seems to have collectively 
agreed that it’s the key to a good relationship. 
But what happens when the spark starts to 
fizzle? Or disappears altogether? Some couples 
go to marriage counseling while others might 
turn to less traditional methods of rekindling 
the relationship. In Netflix’s newest film, “The 
Lovebirds,” the answer to this question is mur-
der, of course. 
In “The Lovebirds,” Jibran 
(Kumail Nanjiani, “The Big 
Sick”) and Leilani (Issa Rae, 
“Little”) are recent exes who 
somehow 
find 
themselves 
looking like prime suspects for 
a murder — Jibran had blood 
on his coat (for reasons other than murder), and 
they both fled the scene of the crime. The two 
spend the majority of the film believing that 
their lives are over, despite their innocence. 
Though, logically, or if you watch any crime 
show, the two wouldn’t be suspects, but then 
there would be no movie. As the film progress-
es, the audience watches as Jibran and Leilani 
work to solve the murder while also unraveling 
what went wrong in their relationship. 
As one of Netflix’s more original ideas, “The 
Lovebirds” is full of the hijinks expected of a 
buddy cop film — the two go through a tense 
interrogation, obviously have to change into 
disguises and have a strange interaction with 
some fraternity boys. All the while, Jibran and 
Leilani have to contend with their breakup and 
what that actually means. Given the unique 
circumstances, they’re forced to communi-
cate their issues both with the relationship 
and with the way they each want to go about 

solving the murder. This dynamic provides an 
intriguing path of development for the char-
acters and their relationship. The audience 
watches as the two resynchronize and, though 
they still argue, it’s obvious that the trauma of 
fleeing the cops is a fantastic way to discover a 
communication style. 
The actual murder itself is presented as a 
convoluted conspiracy that really only serves to 
extend the story from a 29-minute sitcom epi-
sode to a feature length film. The murder vic-
tim, casually referred to as “Bicycle” (Nicholas 
X. Parsons, “The Domestics”) throughout the 
film, is wrapped up with some secret, cult-like 
society populated by none other than society’s 
elite. It’s far-fetched and the perfect experience 
to bring a couple back together. 
We all know the senators and 
rich billionaires of the world 
come together in weird ways 
and it’s fun to hypothesize 
that it probably happens with 
everyone in strange masks and 
odd sexual rituals. 
And, despite the complicated nature of cre-
ating a plausible conspiracy, “The Lovebirds” 
still realizes the importance of remembering 
reality. Jibran and Leilani, after a few hours 
in their new life on the run, finally make a pit 
stop at the dinner party they were supposed 
to attend that night. Here, they’re forced into 
their “normal” lives. Lives with issues that, 
after considering their night as criminals, seem 
suddenly trivial. It’s a moment of understand-
ing for both Leilani, Jibran and their relation-
ship as a whole. What’s more entertaining, 
however, is the fact that the leading couple isn’t 
another pair of white people. Instead, we sim-
ply have two actors of color playing prominent 
roles that have little focus on the color of their 
skin. They’re simply two people that might be 
arrested for murder. And while this may seem 
like an unimportant detail, it shows Holly-
wood’s progressive steps towards more inclu-
sive casting decisions. 

After I was born, my mother bought me 
timeless editions of her favorite books for me 
to read. A book lover and librarian, she hoped 
that I would be a reader like her and love the 
books she cherished throughout her life. On the 
inside cover each book, she inscribed my name 
on Winnie the Pooh book plates, and waited 
for the day when I would read them books my 
mother left me. I promised myself when I read 
them I would read them all at once, and the 
opportune moment arrived when quarantine 
began.
On the bottom right shelf of the chipping 
bookcase in my bedroom is a row of books my 
mother bought for me after I was born. The 
books, spanning from Jane Austen’s “Mans-
field Park” to Margery Williams’s “The Vel-
veteen Rabbit,” are books that stuck with her 
throughout her life, books she hoped her kids 
would love as much as she did. Some of the col-
lection I have read before, but they weren’t the 
timeless editions my mom bought me. These 
intimidated me — their thick, glossy pages and 
sturdy covers juxtaposed the selection of flimsy 
paperbacks stuffed into the other shelves. They 
looked and felt too real, too capable of swallow-
ing me whole. So for 19 years I danced around 
them, each of us conscious of the other, but at a 
safe distance away. Whenever I had the courage 
to open them up, I decided I must read them all 
at once. 
I returned home from school, and opened 
my bedroom door. My bookcase is the first 
thing I saw. The second were the books from 
my mother, and it seemed unlikely that I would 
have another opportune moment like this.
I started with Louisa May Alcott’s “Little 
Women” — a book whose 1994 movie adapta-
tion I had watched about a year ago with my 
mother, and whose 2019 version I watched 
alone last winter. I already knew the basic 
story, which is what drew me to it. I knew I 
would love Jo and cry for Beth, but the emo-
tions and realizations those movies sparked did 
not match the magic the book pulled me into. I 
was completely right to be afraid of being swal-
lowed whole. “Little Women” captured me 
completely. 
I think it was the overwhelming sense of 
familiarity — a sort of déjà vu I felt nearly every 
chapter, like I had read these crisp pages before. 
I felt inexplicably connected to the characters, 
as if I were a fifth sister reveling in Jo’s antics 
and Meg’s first love. But the more I read, the 
more I saw that the reflection I found was not 
of myself, but rather my mother and the wis-
dom and counsel she shared with me through-
out my life. I started to wonder if the ideas of 
Marmie were what inspired her in her mother-
hood, but came to conclude that it wasn’t that 

at all. The innate generosity and unwavering 
love of Marmie cannot be replicated, it must be 
rooted in oneself. The same goodness is in my 
mother. She blossoms with unselfishness and 
unconditional love. 
My mother and I have always been oddly 
close. While first my mother, she has always 
been my closest friend, too, and although I 
believe her to share the virtue of Marmie, 
the relationship I thought to most reveal my 
own with her was not that of a daughter and 
Marmie, but instead that of Jo and Beth. 
The relationships between the four sisters 
are all varied and complex. Jo is closest to Beth, 
though they have rather opposite personalities 
and values. Jo is hardheaded and vigorously 
ambitious, while sweet Beth is known for her 
shyness and quiet nature. Jo was my mother’s 
favorite character. Beth is mine. 
I saw my mother so plainly in Beth. Like 
Beth, she is “shy and quiet, sitting in corners 
till needed, and living for others so cheerfully 
that no one sees the sacrifices.” She lives for 
her children, for her family, for her friends and 
for strangers. She is the connection between 
us, watering us all with her support and warm 
embraces.
Sometimes I am afraid she doesn’t see that, 
as Beth failed to. It’s frustrating to love someone 
who is blinded to their own brilliance. How do 
you convince someone they deserve the world 
when they find themselves unworthy of it? Or 
worse, what can you give someone who wants 
for nothing? I heard my frustrations echoed in 
Jo’s overbearing efforts to fulfil the happiness 
of her closest friend. When Beth was sick again, 
Jo fell sick too with vain hopes. Jo couldn’t save 
her, but she could love her. And Beth wanted 
nothing more than to be loved.
Seeing past herself was never one of Jo’s 
strong points, and I fear it is neither one of 
mine. She learned countless lessons from Beth 
in just the nature of her, as I do my mother. The 
two were incredibly different, yet these dif-
ferences never hindered their understanding. 
Being around each other made both stronger. 
And maybe that’s why my heart broke so 
dearly when Beth passed — the sorrow of a loss 
of someone who is a part of you. Yet, it wasn’t 
her death specifically that ruined me. It was the 
moment she shared with Jo some weeks before 
her death that did it. Beth, sick on the couch, 
worries that she hasn’t done enough with her 
life when she spots one of Jo’s poems. It asks 
Beth to leave behind her patience, her courage 
and her unselfish nature when she goes. I see 
my mom worry as well about the legacy she will 
leave when her time comes, and I only hope she 
can be comforted by how much I love her as Jo 
loved Beth; that as Beth is Jo’s “conscience,” she 
is mine, and I spend every day trying to resem-
ble her.

Color as a symptom of the coronavirus

As the spread of the coronavirus 
exponentially increases by the day, 
so does its toll with 1,678,843 total 
cases and 99,031 deaths in the U.S. 
alone. Despite making up only 13.4 
percent of this nation’s population, 
the Black population is seen to 
be disproportionately victim of 
more than 50% of reported cases, 
33 percent of hospitalizations and 
approximately 60 percent of the 
deaths from the pandemic. Though 
these reports are often deemed 
related to health comorbidities 
prevently 
experienced 
amongst 
the Black community, the social 
inequities experienced by race are 
more to blame.

PRISHA GROVER
MiC Staff Writer

The video “Substitute Teacher” 
by comedians Keegan-Michael Key 
and Jordan Peele (often referred 
to simply as Key and Peele) put a 
hilarious spin on the very common 
experience of students who have 
had their names distorted by 
their educational leaders. This 
lighthearted video is a reference 
to a much bigger issue in which 
people have developed a certain 
apathy when it comes to the 
pronunciation of names which 
appear unconventional to them. 
I was raised being taught that 
my name represented my ties to 
my culture and role in the world 
— a belief quite common among 
Southeast Asian communities. 
I decided to ask some of my 
friends about their names, and 
what having that name means.

While findings indicated that age 
(39 years+), sex (male), income 
status (low-income) and insurance 
status (Medicaid, self-pay, or no 
insurnace) did increase the odds of 
hopsitalization, race independently 
influenced susceptibilty to hospital 
admission because of COVID-19. 
While the public seems to be 
surprised by the health disparities 
presented during this pandemic, 
the health burden as a person of 
color in America is anything but 
unordinary. The most prevalent 
health inequities experienced in 
this country are perpetuated by 
the systematic barriers that racism 
has inspired. The color of your skin 
ultimately warrants restrictions 
in health security to attain this 
country’s unalienable rights of life, 
liberty and pursuit of happiness. 
Race and ethnicity are crucially 
related to access to care, resources 
to treatment and health outcomes 
defined in social determinants of 
health.

Social determinants of health 
express the everyday social and 
physical conditions in which people 
play, work and live. According to 
HealthyPeople.gov, these factors 
express how individual health 
outcomes intersect with underlying 
issues that stem from economic 
stability, education, neighborhood 
and built environment, health 
and 
healthcare 
and 
social 
and 
community 
contexts. 
It 
standardizes the quality of living 
people are able to achieve and 
afford. 
The 
historically 
racist 
subjugations in the foundations 
that this country was founded 
upon leaves communities of color 
disenfranchised to suffer worse 
health outcomes. 
The 
health 
outcomes 
of 
marginalized 
communities 
presenting at the top of COVID’s 
food chain are driven by poverty 
and food insecurity and bisected 
by 
housing. 
The 
majority 
of 
the 
13.4 
million 
low-income 
American families are racial or 

ethnic minorities: Four million 
(30 percent) are hispanic, 2.9 
million (22 percent) are black, 
and about 800,000 (6 percent) 
are other nonwhites. According 
to the CDC, these families make 
up the majority of overpopulated 
American 
metropolitans 
due 
to 
institutionalized 
residential 
housing segregation and often live 
in multigenerational households 
with poor access to resources to 
drive quality of living. Racial and 
ethnic minorities often live in 
these conditions not as a means of 
personal choice or financial means, 
but by legislatively deliberate racial 
de facto segregation and redlining 
that affect residential housing 
and school systems, especially 
from the 1950s to 1970s. Though 
many people are unaware of the 
impacts legislative discrimination 
has played in the history of this 
country, it still plays a major part 
of current standards of health and 
implicitly influenced by private 
discrimination 
in 
real 
estate, 

banks, clothing, food and more. 
These households, in which the 
majority of essential workers arise 
from, are often subjected to food 
swamps, poorer physical housing 
and neighborhood infrastructures, 
limited 
occupational 
mobility 
and 
opportunity, 
and 
higher 
rates of stress. This then plays 
into increased prevalence and 
comorbidities 
with 
higher 
rates of obesity, asthma rates, 
hypertension, diabetes and other 
health conditions due to poorer 
housing conditions and access 
to care. Therefore, the overall 
risk of infection is not only more 
prevalent in communities of color, 
but these communities also have 
pre-existing health disadvantages 
that have suppressed their immune 
systems. While the essential work 
of racial and ethnic minorities 
might currently carry the nation, it 
is at the cost of their lives. 

means “blessing from Allah” 
During this conversation, many 
of them mentioned that their names 
are 
often 
mispronounced 
and 
although they make initial attempts 
to correct those who falsify their 
identity, they often fall complacent 
as a result of the person’s unwilling 
tongue. My name means “a blessing 
from God,” and while the common 

mispronunciation of it as Pree-
shah doesn’t change the meaning, 
I’ve always felt that choosing to 
pronounce my name incorrectly 
disregards its origin. I was given 
my name because my parents 
struggled to have kids for several 
years after having my older brother 
and suffered many complications 
throughout their pregnancy with 

me, thus when I was born, they felt 
that God had blessed them. The 
Sanskrit word “Prisha” is meant 
to give hope and warmth, and the 
way I pronounce it is the way my 
parents gave it to me. As my friend 
Jeevin says, “There’s a certain pride 
that you carry when you know your 
name has such a powerful meaning 
… it is a reminder of my roots.” 

Followers of Hinduism will 
often name their children after 
important figures in Hindu epics. 
For example, the name Arjun is the 
name of one of the heroes of the 
Mahabharata and one of the five 
Pandava brothers. He is said to be a 
symbol of clarity, loyalty and often 
won the favor of the gods. When 
someone names their child Arjun, 
they are paying respect to his 
namesake and hoping their child 
will be a testament to Arjun’s strong 
character. This is no different than 
someone naming their child after 
the Angel Gabriel or the Prophet 
Muhammad. 
Despite these sacred meanings, 
so 
many 
people 
resort 
to 
pronunciations 
or 
nicknames 
which are easier for the American 
tongue to pronounce. This is not 
about shortening one’s name just 
to a cute friendly nickname, but 
is about the obligation some feel 
to change what they are called in 
an act of complacency for other’s 
lack of effort. An example of 
this is people named “Prathik” 
(pronounced Prah-theek) going by 
the name “Peter.”

‘Never Have I Ever’ gone 
into an introspective spiral

SUNITHA PALAT
MiC Staff Writer

Recently, I binged Season 1 of Mindy 
Kaling’s “Never Have I Ever,” a classic com-
ing-of-age teen rom-com revolving around 
the life of a 15-year old Indian American, 
Devi Vishwakumar. At first I was uninter-
ested in another heartfelt yet cringey Netflix 
series, but the show’s mixed reviews sparked 
my curiosity: While a few of my friends 
told me the show perpetuated stereotypical 
tropes of South Asian Americans — a sight 
I did not need to see — “NHIE” has also 
been acclaimed as “a watershed moment for 
the representation of South Asians in Hol-
lywood.” Curious, but more so bored out of 
my mind during quarantine, I gave the ten-
episode show a try.
In summary, the plot revolves around 
Devi’s standard trials and tribulations as a 
15-year-old girl. She navigates the ups and 
downs of relationships with her best friends, 
her mother and of course, the boy she’s been 
crushing on. Yet, her adolescence and search 
for a different, newer and cooler identity is 
what made it a bit more complex when she 
loses her father to cardiac arrest. The show — 
as expected — is heartfelt, cringey and cute, 
but is also filled with vulnerable moments 
relating to her grief and her Indian heritage. 
Among all of these, my favorite trait of the 
show was that it made me feel represented. 
When I think of Indian Americans in 
the shows I watched growing up, I think of 
Ravi from “Jessie,” Baljeet from “Phineas 
and Ferb,” Raj from “The Big Bang Theory” 
and a few other often socially awkward, 
teased, overly studious characters who did 
not represent me. Devi, on the other hand, 
does. She has a full American accent, cares 
about school while also caring about social 
goals (popularity, her crush, fitting in) like 
any normal teenager, hangs out with white 
friends, likes cheeseburgers and doesn’t 
outwardly exert her Indian identity. Watch-
ing her character — particularly how she 

Immigrant Parents: An 
unspoken love language

My mother called me to her room late at 
night. The house was eerily quiet as it was 
every night, my father already fast asleep 
downstairs and the rest of the house void of 
sound except for the dripping of a leaky fau-
cet. I sighed as I climbed down from my bed 
and shuffled towards her room, predicting 
that the subsequent conversation would be of 
little significance. I knew she noticed I was 
upset earlier today and would ask if anything 
happened, and I would of course deflect and 
tell her everything was okay. It was difficult 
for me to express my concerns with either 
of my parents, as it often resulted in me 
explaining my worries with little applicable, 
almost surface level feedback. Perhaps it was 
the language barrier. While we both speak 
our mother tongue, Bangla, my thoughts and 
ideas were always expressed better in Eng-
lish. This was how it had always been. 
Yet, tonight seemed a little different. I 
sat down on her bed, and my mother didn’t 
say a word. Time seemed to stand still for a 
moment. Mother and son just waiting for one 
another to speak. 
Impatiently I asked, “What?”
My mother just shook her head and said, 
“Nothing,” in Bangla.
For a few more seconds, I sat down and 
then slowly, as if there was a gravitational 
force pulling me towards her, I rested my 
head next to her. I felt a weight off my shoul-
ders retract and my muscles began to relax as 
I let my body go. I felt my mother’s hand on 
my head, small but strong. My ever present 
headache gradually receded as she massaged 
my head, and I felt a small bit of relief after 
a long day. No more words were spoken that 
night.
And so, this slowly became a part of my 
interaction with my mother. Rather than 
speaking about what happened throughout 

the day, good or bad, we would sit in silence 
together, her often watching a movie on Net-
flix, and I scrolling on my phone. Some days 
I would watch a movie by her side and other 
days we would both read next to each other. 
This became our time together.
It’s commonly known that there are five 
main “love languages,” five ways to express 
and experience love: words of affirmation, 
quality time, receiving gifts, acts of service 
and physical touch, as described by Gary 
Chapman in his book The Five Love Lan-
guages. Quality time refers to time set aside 
for paying full and undivided attention to a 
person or matter at hand. While I can make 
a case that my interactions with my mother 
are quality time or physical touch, I believe 
that there is an unspoken love language that 
many parents utilize. One where our worlds 
are different but unwavering faith and sup-
port are never absent.
Often at the dinner tables of my Cauca-
sian friends, I would see their parents light 
up about the stories they told from their col-
lege days. They spoke endlessly about “how 
it was back in the day,” and my friends would 
spoon it up with the rest of their meal with 
the utter satisfaction of truly getting to know 
their parents even more. It all came full cir-
cle for them as they now find themselves in 
the same position their parents were in 25 
years ago. In my case, it’s different. My par-
ents don’t go into the details of their teenage 
years. It’s sometimes frustrating since I feel 
my relationship with my parents will never 
be as strong because the lives they led back 
home are too foreign for me to ever connect 
with. As I grew older, I realized my parents 
showed their love and enthusiasm in other 
ways. 
Although not so evident, the feeling of 
faith endowed upon another can be one of 
the most heartfelt yet subtle in nature.

navigates her heritage — reminded me of my 
young self. The painfully honest and genuine 
depiction of her uncomfortableness, slight 
disdain and forced acceptance of her Indian-
ness triggered some unexpected introspec-
tion within myself while watching the show, 
especially during episode 4, “Never Have I 
Ever...Felt Super Indian.”
A hit Hindi song from the 1970s, “Dum 
Maro Dum,” kicks this episode off while 
Devi is being dressed up by her cousin. She is 
adorned with jhumka earrings, a thick set of 
gold necklaces and a bright blue and gold half 
sari. The look on her face is so recognizable; 
it’s a sense of claustrophobia in a seemingly 
foreign (and itchy) outfit, an expression I’ve 
held every time my mom gets me ready for 
an Indian wedding, religious event or family 
party. In this episode, Devi attends Ganesh 
Puja (a Hindu holiday) put on by the Hindu 
Association of Southern California. I smiled 
as I saw my own personal experiences in 
many parts of the show, like weird conver-
sations with Aunties. But a huge moment of 
truth came out when Devi interacted with 
Harish, a family friend who came back from 
Stanford to attend the event. After asking 
why he would ever come to this “lame fest,” 
he replies:
“My roommate Nick is Native American, 
and he’s so into being Native American. 
At first, I was like, ‘You’re away from your 
parents. You don’t have to pretend to care 
about your ancestry or whatever.’ But then 
he took me to their campus powwow. No one 
was standing in the corner making fun of it. 
They were dancing and chanting, and having 
a great time, and it made me think, why do 
I think it’s so weird and embarrassing to be 
Indian?”
The juxtaposition of the two characters on 
my screen represented the chasm I’ve been 
stuck between for the past five years of my 
life.

Schlissel warns ‘M’ won’t play without on-campus instruction

As colleges and conferences 
across the country move closer 
to resuming athletic activities, 
Michigan 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel is taking a much more 
measured approach.
“If there is no on-campus 
instruction then there won’t be 
intercollegiate athletics, at least 
for Michigan,” Schlissel said 
in an interview with the Wall 
Street Journal.
These remarks come days 
after the NCAA voted to allow 
voluntary football and basketball 
workouts to resume starting 
on June 1 and Michigan Gov. 
Gretchen Whitmer relaxed her 
stay at home order slightly, 
allowing groups of less than 
10 people to congregate in one 
location as long as they practice 

social distancing.
Recently, football coaches Jim 
Harbaugh and Don Brown have 

spoken about the possibility 
of playing in front of empty 
stadiums, 
but 
both 
seemed 

certain about there being a 
season this coming fall.
The ramifications go beyond 
football, as Schlissel also noted 
any decision made about the fall 
would be extended to the winter 
semester also. Meaning that 
there may also be no basketball, 
should classes be online.
Schools across the country 
are making moves to adjust to 
COVID-19, with Notre Dame, 
Texas, North Carolina and South 
Carolina adopting a schedule for 
the fall that sends students home 
on Thanksgiving, extending its 
winter break and starting early. 
The SEC voted to allow use of 
athletic facilities on campus 
beginning June 8 and Texas 
Gov. Greg Abbott believing there 
might be fans in stadiums to 
start the football season.
The 
Big 
Ten 
has 
chosen 
to 
leave 
decisions 
about 

athletic programs largely up 
to the schools, leading to the 
possibility of a season with some 
schools participating and some 
not. Ohio State athletic director 
Gene Smith, for instance, is 
allowing voluntary workouts to 
begin June 8, pending university 
approval.
Football makes up 43 percent 
of Michigan’s athletic revenue 
through the season, and while 
playing without fans will put a 
significant dent in that revenue, 
a 
season 
without 
football 
entirely will be incredibly costly 
to the University. The athletic 
department’s budget last year 
was $185 million, but it seems 
that won’t play much into a 
decision.
“So although trouble in a $185 
million unit is a big deal, it isn’t 
of the scale that it threatens the 
University,” Schlissel said.

Harbaugh, Brown ready to play in empty stadiums

Since the COVID-19 pandemic 
halted all sports back in March, 
it’s been fairly clear: If we’re 
lucky enough to get them back, 
100,000 fans in the Big House is 
probably a step too far.
That remains the case, even 
as the NCAA starts to carve out 
a path to reopening — it voted 
Wednesday to allow voluntary 
activities for football and men’s 
and 
women’s 
basketball 
to 
resume June 1. And, barring a 
medical miracle, stuffing the Big 
House this August will remain 
an unhealthy choice.
“There is a reason to feel some 
confidence 
here,” 
Michigan 
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said 
in a radio interview recently. 
“But we also have to measure 
(people’s) expectations and say 
life’s going to be different. We’re 
not going to be filling stadiums 
in the fall.”
With that in mind, Michigan 
football seems more than ready 
to deal with the new reality.
Defensive 
coordinator 
Don 
Brown spent five years as an 
assistant coach at Hartford High 
School in Vermont, from 1977-82, 
and knows what it’s like to look 
up in the stands and see just 500-

600 people there.
“The one good thing is, people 
get excited about it that are there, 
but will there be anybody there?” 
Brown said Thursday on a Zoom 
call with reporters. “Let’s hope. 
The key will be the preparation. 
And I think this: The Michigan 
guys, the Michigan football guys 
that I know, love football. They 
love it. They love playing it. They 
love everything associated with 
it.”
One 
day 
prior, 
in 
an 
appearance on ESPN’s “Get Up!” 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
said playing in an empty stadium 
wouldn’t be a problem.
“You 
could 
definitely 
test 
both teams, you could test the 
officials and everybody, but can 
you test 100,000 fans coming 
into 
a 
stadium?” 
Harbaugh 
said. “Probably not. Without a 
vaccine, you probably couldn’t 
do that.
“To answer your question, 
heck yeah, I’d be comfortable 
coaching a game without any 
fans. If the choice were play in 
front of no fans or not play, then 
I would choose to play in front of 
no fans. And darn near every guy 
I’ve talked to on our team, that’s 
the way they feel about it.”
Other coaches and programs 

have been more optimistic — 
Ohio State athletic director Gene 
Smith told reporters this week he 
could see holding games at Ohio 
Stadium with limited capacity 
— but the overriding desire at 
Michigan is simply to get back 
on the field and in Schembechler 
Hall.
“We’ve got a good group of 

coaches and analysts and we’re 
just anxious, chomping to get 
back into the building and get 
back to some form of normalcy,” 
Brown said. “Cause I love my seat 
in that room (at Schembechler) 
when I got the two screens. I just 
feel like I’m in my element there. 
Sitting in my spare bedroom in 
Cape Cod sometimes just doesn’t 

cut it.”
Of course, even that won’t look 
normal. Brown talked of wearing 
a mask in the building and 
holding staff meetings in a team 
room in order to practice social 
distancing. But stipulations like 
that are worth it if it means 
football can happen.
“Just like coach (Harbaugh) 
said, hey, I’d rather play in front 
of nobody then not play,” Brown 
said. “Cause that could knock me 
into retirement.”

Michael Barrett looks like Khaleke Hudson’s replacement at VIPER

The last time Michigan football 
needed to find a new VIPER, it 
looked to Khaleke Hudson.
Now, with Hudson going to 
the NFL’s Washington Redskins, 
defensive coordinator Don Brown 
needs another starter at the hybrid 
position, and he thinks he’s got one 
in Michael Barrett.
“I’d seen enough out of Michael 
Barrett to be excited,” Brown said 
on a Zoom call with reporters 
on Thursday. “Runs 4.51 — that’s 
fast (in the 40-yard dash). At 220 
pounds. So that’s a good place to 
start.”
With spring football canceled 

due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
there hasn’t been much of a chance 
for 
competition, 
or 
in-person 
evaluation, at any position. To 
some extent, that makes any 
prognostication a crapshoot at this 
point, but Barrett projected to be 
the clubhouse leader to replace 
Hudson even last season.
He played 12 games for Michigan 
last year, mostly on special teams, 
but appeared at the VIPER spot 
against Notre Dame. A quarterback 
in high school, Barrett was recruited 
as an athlete, making him a strong 
fit for a position that Brown has 
made uniquely his own, in the mold 
of Jabrill Peppers.
“We talked Peppers into being the 
VIPER,” Brown said. “We get him to 

do this, you’re going to blitz, you’re 
going to play the edge, you’re going 
to do all these things, and we kind of 
tricked him into being the VIPER.”
Brown 
cited 
Barrett’s 
relationships with Cam McGrone 
and Josh Ross, who are expected 
to start at the other two linebacker 
spots. Though freshman William 
Mohan could push Barrett for 
playing time, that would be a tall ask 
— especially given the conditions 
created by the pandemic.
“(Mohan’s) a true freshman and 
has that kind of ability,” Brown said. 
“And obviously we have a number 
of guys at the safety position that 
it would be smooth as silk to drop 
them into the VIPER position with 
one of those guys.” 

Anthony 
Solomon, 
a 
rising 
sophomore, may be likely to get 
backup VIPER reps, Brown said. 
Solomon is up from 195 pounds 
to 215, and his year of experience 
makes him a known commodity. 
Right now, that’s a luxury.
“He’s another guy that’ll give 
(Barrett) competition,” Brown said. 
“So right now, we’re trying to get 
our best players on the field — that’s 
always the initial thing, is get your 
best 11, 12 on the field, and we think 
the best thing for our defense, and 
for Michael Barrett, because they’re 
both important pieces to us, is for 
him to play VIPER.”
In three years starting for 
Michigan, Hudson missed just one 
game and was one of the Wolverines’ 

more dependable commodities. He 
finished his Michigan career with 
225 tackles and 23 tackles for loss, 
along with a strong track record 
as a special-teamer. That kind of 
production wouldn’t be easy to 
replace, even if the Wolverines had 
a regular schedule of spring ball, 
summer workouts and fall camp.
Experience is a commodity. 
Barrett has it.
“Some guys can play inside 
linebacker, but they can’t play 
VIPER,” Brown said. “Most guys 
(who) play VIPER can move to 
the 
inside 
linebacker 
position. 
(Barrett’s) one of those guys … he’s 
been in the backup VIPER role for 
us. So it’s not like he’s alien to the 
position.”

In Uche’s absence, Michigan plans to retool pass rush

Just under a month ago, the New 
England Patriots swooped up Josh 
Uche in the second round of the 
NFL Draft. Michigan’s do-it-all 
pass rusher was officially gone, and 
without a spring season, there was 
little clarity on who would replace 
him.
But as he detailed in a Zoom 
call with local reporters Thursday 
morning, Don Brown has some 

ideas.
Last year, in order to get Uche 
on the field, Brown frequently 
showcased 3-4 looks on second and 
third down. This year, Brown plans 
to run more plays from a four-down 
base and utilize a variety of players 
in different packages that play to 
their strengths. The catch? Without 
a spring season to evaluate, he’s not 
yet sure what those packages will 
look like.
“It’s like, if we had gotten 
through spring we’d already have 

those answers, so when we’ve done 
preseason we have to have those 
answers,” Brown said. “But I’m 
very excited about, when you can 
say multiple guys have a chance to 
impact you in a pass-rush scenario, 
that’s a good thing.”
In particular, Brown praised 
senior Luiji Vilain, sophomore David 
Ojabo and junior Taylor Upshaw as 
players who could impact the pass 
rush in 2020. That’s along with 
defensive ends Aidan Hutchinson 
and Kwity Paye — both 2019 starters 

primed to anchor a young defensive 
line.
Still, Brown knows replacing 
Uche’s 
production 
is 
no 
easy 
task. In 2019, Uche pressured the 
quarterback on 26 percent of pass-
rush snaps. There likely isn’t a single 
person on the 2020 roster who 
can replicate that — a testament to 
Uche’s skill more than the others’ 
shortfalls.
“Unlike a year ago when Uche 
was an internal blitzer, he’s an 
external blitzer, he could do all those 

things as a standup two-point stance 
defensive end, you may have to 
divide that work between one or two 
guys because one guy may be great 
on the edge, the other may be great 
in short-area quickness and change 
of direction scenarios, might be 
better,” Brown said. “And those are 
the things that we’re waiting just to 
find out and see how that plays out.”
Despite the uncertainty, Brown 
is confident. Ojabo, who grew up 
in Nigeria and Scotland and didn’t 
begin playing football until his junior 
year of high school, was always going 
to face a steeper learning curve, but 
Brown sees in him many of Uche’s 
traits. Upshaw, who has an NFL 
pedigree, saw limited reps last year 
and became someone Brown felt 
strongly about. Vilain — who didn’t 
see the field his first two seasons 
with the program due to injury — 
was primed for a bigger role last year 
but saw fewer opportunities after 
the addition of graduate transfer 
Michael Danna.
“I go back and watch Luiji (Vilain) 
play last year at times,” Brown said. 
“And … the bottom line is, it’s his time 
now and he’ll have an opportunity to 
prove what he can do, and I think 
we’re gonna get productive, solid 
play out of him as well.”
Brown has come to accept that he 
won’t be able to see exactly what he 
has until the team begins fall camp 
— something that is likely still a few 
months off. But when he looks at the 
tape, he’s able to dream of the pass 
rush’s potential, with or without 
Uche.

Jim 
Harbaugh 
knows 
Michigan has to beat Ohio 
State. Don Brown is falling 
right behind him in line.
“I think coach (Harbaugh) 
addressed the Ohio State issue 
yesterday, am I right?” Brown 
said on a Zoom call with 
reporters. “So he’s the boss, 
that’s what he said, that’s what 
I’m gonna try to do.”
Speaking on Mike Tirico’s 
show Wednesday, Harbaugh 
said, 
“Nothing 
makes 
us 
angrier,” than losing to Ohio 
State. Over the last decade, 
though, that’s become almost 
a yearly occurrence, as the 
Wolverines have lost eight in a 

row against the Buckeyes.
Lately, much of the issues 
have come as a result of the 
defense Brown coordinates. 
In 2018, Ohio State put up 
62 points on Michigan in 
Columbus, and last November, 
it was 56, both leading to 
blowout victories for a program 
that has become accustomed to 
beating the Wolverines.
“I don’t blame players for 
anything, OK?” Brown said. 
“You blame the old guy, right 
here. OK? I gotta do a better 
job of getting our players ready 
and I promise you I’m going 
to.”
Last spring, Brown struck 
a similar tone when asked 
about the Ohio State game, 
and it didn’t lead to much 

improvement. His defense, 
in other games, has been one 
of the best in the country. 
Michigan 
ranked 
11th 
in 
defensive SP+ last season 
and has consistently been in 
or around the top 10 since 
Brown’s arrival in Ann Arbor.
But against bigger, better 
teams — the kind Michigan 
needs to beat to vault itself into 
the higher tier of programs in 
the country — the defense has 
fallen short.
Last year, prior to Ohio 
State, 
those 
shortcomings 
came against Wisconsin and 
Penn State, two road games 
in which the Wolverines fell 
short.
“We had four to five bad run 
fits, two bad plays in the pass 

game (against Wisconsin),” 
Brown said. “And we’re out of 
the football game.”
A few bad plays is all it takes 
against a high-caliber team. 
At Wisconsin, that meant a 
72-yard touchdown run for 
Jonathan Taylor, part of a 203-
yard performance on the day. 
At Penn State, it was a coverage 
miscommunication resulting 
in a 53-yard K.J. Hamler score. 
In the Citrus Bowl against 
Alabama, it was an 85-yard 
score by Jerry Jeudy on the 
first play of the game.
That’s the gap Brown now 
needs to bridge, between good 
and great. 
“We took all the pieces of 
that (Alabama) game that 
are negative, and I promise 

you, we’re gonna practice 
those plays against assorted 
looks,” Brown said. “And we 
took the same thing from the 
Ohio State game and we’ll be 
practicing against those plays, 
too, because in that scenario, 
again — it’s college football. 
When you’re not successful, 
it’s eight or nine plays, or it’s 
a group of plays that you just 
want back.”
There are positives from 
which to build, and Brown will 
talk about them passionately, 
even from the spare bedroom 
of his house in Cape Cod over 
a video call. The Wolverines 
came off that shellacking at 
Wisconsin and held Iowa to 
just three points, with eight 
sacks and 14 tackles for loss. 

They held Penn State to 72 
yards in the second half and 
came within a goal-line stand 
of forcing overtime in a white 
out. They hung with Alabama 
for three quarters.
That’s not nothing. Neither 
is winning nine games and 
finishing just outside the top 10 
as a defense. But it’s not where 
Brown, or Harbaugh, want 
to be. Especially if it means 
another embarrassing loss to 
Ohio State in 2020.
“Once again, the Ohio State 
game was a huge negative for 
us,” Brown said. “So I’m not 
gonna live in that world. And 
I don’t want the players to live 
in that world. We acknowledge 
it, we move on from it, and 
hopefully I do a better job.”

Bakich spearheads proposal to change college baseball schedule

Michigan coach Erik Bakich’s motto of “You can’t get hot 
if you don’t start cold” might need to change soon, should a 
proposal he’s spearheading to change the structure of college 
baseball be accepted.
The proposal, penned by Bakich and several other prominent 
coaches, and released on May 21, is still in its infancy and has yet 
to be formally presented to NCAA legislators. However, Bakich 
feels optimistic that it will be met with a positive response by the 
NCAA because Michigan Athletic Director Warde Manuel has 
been very supportive of his ideas. 
This proposal hopes to solve many problems within college 
baseball, especially in the wake of COVID-19, by limiting the 
budget damage of an incredibly expensive program to operate 
and helping athletes thrive both on and off the field. 
The proposal aims to push back opening day by four weeks, 
from mid-February to mid-March, allowing northern schools 
like Michigan to start their season by playing home games, 
instead of spending their first month on the road. This change 
would come with a corresponding extension four weeks later 
into summer — with the Men’s College World Series ending in 
mid-July.
This is not a new concept, and different ideas of pushing back 
the college baseball season have existed for years. But with the 
impending financial burdens due to COVID-19, this proposal 
not only makes sense for cold-weather schools, but for warm-
weather ones as well. 
A major impetus for this proposal is the large amount of 
money that can be saved by eliminating the early season road 
trips consistently taken by northern teams. Additionally, 
warm-weather schools won’t need to hand out hefty financial 
guarantees in order to make the travel feasible for the cold-
weather schools. 
“Athletic directors and administrators around the country 
have a concept of more regionalized scheduling, not just in 
baseball, but among a lot of teams,” Bakich said in a video press 
conference. “(This would help by) cutting down travel budgets, 
improving student welfare by not taking these long trips and 

jeopardizing their academics and missed class time.”
Over the last five years, Michigan spent on average $232,000 
on travel costs during the first four weekends of the season. 
Should the proposal pass, Michigan could add eight to 12 home 
games each season, which would save approximately $60,000 to 
$75,000 per season.
“It’s going to be really hard to invest in a sport that loses 
money every year that operates at such a significant financial net 
loss,” Bakich said. “And I’m not talking about a loss of 100,000 
bucks. I’m talking about seven figures of net loss.”
The benefits for cold weather schools are obvious, but Bakich 
emphasized in the proposal how the schedule change would help 
warm weather schools as well. According to the data presented 
in the proposal, teams across the country have much higher 
attendance in April and May as opposed to February and March 
— due to both poor weather and the finale of the basketball 
seasons.
For Michigan, Ray Fisher Stadium rarely reaches capacity 
until late April and May, when students have already left and 
there’s only a couple more weeks left in the season. Bakich 
argues that even the general baseball fan and families, which 
make up most of the attendance at games and subsequently the 
revenue, don’t associate baseball season until the beginning of 
the MLB season.
The financial aspect of this proposal has helped it earn 
attention, but Bakich emphasized that Michigan players, and 
players across the country, stand to gain from this academically 
and in terms of their overall well-being.
Michigan, for example, will benefit from fewer early-season 
road trips because their student-athletes won’t have to miss 
classes and won’t have the same level of stress on their bodies 
from travelling.
With a pushed back start date, players will also have more 
time to properly condition their bodies leading up to the season, 
leading to fewer injuries. 
“Student welfare should be enough to stand alone and make 
it pass,” Bakich said. “But now that you have finances attached 
to it that has real traction with athletic departments and athletic 
directors and administrators looking for ways to improve their 
bottom lines.”
Student-athletes would lose four more weeks of their summer 

with the proposed schedule, but it allows players to have a longer 
off-season in the fall, which would benefit their academics 
greatly. 
The change in off-season would also affect coaches’ recruiting 
calendars. Coaches typically focus their recruiting efforts 
through the duration of the summer and many expressed their 
concerns about how the change in schedule would affect their 
recruiting ability. 
However, Bakich said that the teams that make postseason 
runs, and thus would lose most of their summer, would actually 
benefit from the exposure they receive. Bakich found TV 
exposure was more beneficial than time spent on the recruiting 
trail. 
Having discussed the proposal with the team’s upperclassmen, 
Bakich is optimistic about their response and those of other 
players around the country and hopes it will translate to the 
decision makers in the NCAA. 
“(The players) were very, very excited about it, as they should 
be,” Bakich said. “As a cold weather team, not that we need the 
season moved back to have any type of success, but the idea of 
packing Ray Fisher stadium with a game in June… would be so 
awesome.”
Bakich and the other coaches that created this proposal set 
an aggressive timeline to implement these changes, hoping for 
them to be put in place before the 2022 season.
