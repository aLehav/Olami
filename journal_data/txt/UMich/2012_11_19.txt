ANN ARBOR CITY COUNCIL
City Council
to consider
new funding
policies for art

After public art
ballot proposal
fails, city looks for
alternatives
By TAYLOR WIZNER
Daily StaffReporter
After the failure of the city's
public arts millage on the
November ballot, the Ann Arbor
City Council will discuss two
ordinances to resolve the issue of
public art funding.
The proposal would have
eliminated restrictions on city-
funded public art and opened
funding to temporary work and
performance art, including Festi-
fools. Now that the proposal is no
longer an option, several Council
members have indicated a desire
to alter the current Percent for
Art program, which takes one
percent of funding from city con-
struction projects to fund perma-
nent public art installations.
However, Councilmember
Jane Lumm (I-Ward 2) is put-

ting forward an ordinance that
would terminate the program.
Lumm's proposal, which would
cease all funding for public arts
through the Percent for Art pro-
gram, includes revisions to the
city code that note if the program
is dismissed, public art projects
could still be funded by the city
on a case by case basis.
The ordinance modifies the
source of fundingfor maintaining
public art displays, stating that
funds can come from the city's
public arts trust "or such other
funds as the City Council may
appropriate." If the Council votes
to accept this proposal, all public
arts projects will cease by July 1,
2013.
Also, councilmembers Sabra
Briere (D-Ward 1) and Marcia
Higgins (D-Ward 4) are spon-
soring an ordinance that would
amend sections of the City Code
regarding public art.
The amendment would per-
tain to public arts sections and
would allow more freedom for

NEW ONLINE COURSES
On Thursday, 10 universities
announced they will partner to

The platform, called Semes-

who attend the universities
involved to take courses online,

while interacting with the pro-

over video chat, as well as access
course materials and a course

Institutions in the part-

Northwestern Provost Dan

At event, students
and faculty share
international
project experiences
ByASHWINI NATARAJAN
DailyStaffReporter
As part of the University's con-
tinued efforts toward promoting
international health initiatives,
students and faculty gathered
on Friday to share their experi-
ences inthe field aspartofGlobal
Health Student Day.
During the event, held in
Palmer Commons, students lis-
tened to presentations focused
on health, disease and initia-
tives to prevent illness, and
heard about opportunities for
public health research abroad.
Students also showcased their
findings from projects conduct-
ed throughout the last year and
engaged with attendees.
The day kicked off with a
keynote address from William
J. Martin, the associate direc-
tor for disease prevention and
health promotion at the Nation-
al Institute of Child Health and
Human Development, which is
part of the National Institutes

of Health. Martin's lecture
focused on global health issues
surrounding chronic respirato-
ry diseases such as asthma and
chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.
Martin began by character-
izing non-communicable dis-
eases - medical conditions
that cannot be transmitted
from person to person - as
one of the main public health
issues worldwide. He also dis-
cussed the asthma epidemic in
the 20th century, noting the
impact nutrition, environment,
trans-generational factors and
birth weight has on the fetal
origins of diseases.
"Prevention of disease may
be possible in the first thou-
sand days, years before it even
begins," Martin said.
He added that the Univer-
sity should oversee its efforts
abroad to maximize success
and make a positive impact,
emphasizing that their com-
mitmentto international health
should be a long-term effort.
"I think the key is for univer-
sities individually to figure out
what their talent sets are, what
they can provide and develop
sustainable relationships with
other universities or centers in
host countries," Martin said.

After Martin concluded his
lecture, the audience asked stu-
dent panelists questions about
their experiences, accom-
plishments and challenges in
working to implement progres-
sive and sustainable change.
The three campus organiza-
tions represented were Global
REACH, the Minority Health
and Health Disparities Inter-
national Research Training
program and Bolivia Interdis-
ciplinary Internship Group.
Following the student pan-
els, a poster session was held to
highlight student and faculty
research conducted overseas.
LSA junior William Rog-
ers, who worked on a project
involving family planning and
fertility in Uganda through
MHIRT, said the experience
changed his outlook on what it
means to be a global citizen.
"I think we live in an
increasingly global world, so to
critically engage with issues of
population is important, given
that many countries are rapidly
increasing with population,"
Rogers said. "There's a ques-
tion of, to what point do we
have too many people, and how
does that impact health ser-
vices, how does it impact food
systems?"

Public Health graduate stu-
dent Courtney Hanna, who
researched breast cancer in
Morocco last summer, said her
time abroad helped her become
more of a global student. 0
"It definitely made me more
resilient, in terms of being
dropped into a country," Hanna
said. "I had to navigate myself
in the hospitals. The medical
records were all in French and
I didn't speak French, so I had
to learn some to be able to read
the medical records ... This
experience really changed me."
Students at the fair found
the presentations to be very
helpful and insightful, helping
them choose their global health
study abroad plans for the sum-
mer.
Business junior Becca Pol
lick found that listening to oth-
ers who have conducted health 4
research abroad is essential to
becoming a more globally inte-
grated student.
"I think we see things in
terms of our own bubble," Pol-
lick said. "It's more of what
we know is only what we see.
There's so much more to that,
especially globally. How are
you going to learn it if it's not
from listening to others who
are knowledgeable about it?"
said.
Saltzman said such action
was taken on July 1, when a
10-percent cut to wages in the
Detroit Police Department
was instituted by the emer-
gency manager.
He added that any new
reforms to the current emer-
gency manager law will still
contain some of the Public Act
4 elements, but will not give
as much power to the man-
ager if it is going to remain in
effect.
"The Republicans still have
control of the state legislature
... but they can't pass the same
law that has been rejected by
the voters, but they will try
to have something that gives
more authority to emergency
managers than the old law,"
Saltzman said.


EFM
From Page 1A
with a more flexible and trans-
parent form of the law.
"My hope is that this time
around, the Republicans will be
more bipartisan about the way
they approach the issue and
allow some of the Democratic
amendments to be successful,"
Irwin said.
Snyder was not available
for comment on the proposal's
failure. However, he said in a
November statement that he
believed the act had the poten-
tial to improve the state's econ-
omy.
"This law creates an early
warning system to help com-
munities avoid a financial

emergency, or if they are in
emergency, it empowers an
emergency manager with more
ability to complete their work
so a community can get back on
track faster," Snyder said in the
statement.
Adjunct public health lec-
turer Gregory Saltzman, a pro-
fessor of economics at Albion
College, said the proposal's
rejection will have varying
effects on communities across
Michigan, but particularly sig-
nificant effects on those with
emergency managers already in
place.
"People may be a little bit
anxious about whether they'll
be able to meet their financial
obligations and that could cre-
ate economic problems for the
communities in fiscal trouble,"
Saltzman said.

Four cities - Flint, Benton
Harbor, Pontiac and Ecorse
- and the school districts in
Muskegon Heights, Detroit
and Highland Park have
emergency managers. Addi-
tionally, Detroit, Inkster and
River Rouge are under con-
sent agreements, which offer
a financial review team as an
alternative to a manager.
Saltzman noted that under
Public Act 4, the emergency
manager's extended author-
ity allowed quicker and more
extensive reform.
"(Public Act 4) allowed
emergency managers to have
the authority to not follow
the collective bargaining
process for public employees
anymore ... allowing the emer-
gency manager to unilater-
ally change wages," Saltzman

State police say a 57-year-old
suburban Detroit man has been
killed in an off-road vehicle crash
in the Upper Peninsula.
A news release from the state
police post at St. Ignace says the
crash, happened about 7 p.m.
Wednesday in Schoolcraft Coun-
ty's Mueller Township.
State police say Brian R. Reiss

The city of Santa Monica has
allowed an elaborate nativity
scene in its Palisades Park each
Christmas for nearly 60 years, but
officials are ending the tradition
this year after an atheist set up
his own non-religious display and
caused an uproar.
Now, the churches behind the
nativity are suing in federal court
and claim the city violated their
freedomofspeechbystoppingthe
holiday tradition.
A court hearing Monday in
U.S. District Court in Los Ange-
les could decide the fate of the
Christian tableau for the upcom-
ing season.
The churches want a judge to
blockthe city's ban on private and
unattended displays in the park
until the case is resolved. The city
is asking the court to dismiss the
lawsuit entirely.

Pilots and crew members at
Mozambique's national airline
have gone on a one-day strike,
grounding the carrier.
Linhas Aerrreas de Mocam-

bique's capital Maputo had been
stopped Sunday by the strike.
Workers told journalists that they
wanted higher wages and better
working conditions.
Joao de Abreu, an official with
the state-owned airline, said
international flights Sunday to
Kenya, Tanzania and Zimbabwe
had been cancelled over the strike.
Late Sunday night, negotia-
tor Paulo Napoleao said workers
struck a deal with the airline to
resume flights Monday.
The European Commission
banned Mozambican airlines last

year from flying from Europe, cit-

Christian vigilante
group triggers riots
A Christian vigilante group
killed a Muslim resident who
insisted on going through their
illegal checkpoint, triggering
riots that have left at least four
people dead in central Nigeria,
a local official said Sunday, and
showing how communities have
lost faith in government's ability
to protect them.
Rioters have burned down
houses and shops in the remote
area of Ibi, about 140 miles from
the Taraba state capital of Jalin-
go, said Ibi local government
chairman Isiaku Adamu.
A Taraba State government
spokesman Emmanuel Bello said
Sunday that authorities have sent
troops to the area to quell the vio-
lence.
Christians had put up several
checkpoints early Sunday to stop
Muslimsfromnearingtheir church
during their services as a response
to church attacks in other parts of
the country, Adamu said.

Intense fighting

for a fifth day
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP)
- An Israeli missile ripped
through a two-story home in
a residential area of Gaza City
on Sunday, killing at least 11
civilians, including four young
children and an 81-year-old
woman, in the single deadli-
est attack of Israel's offensive
against Islamic militants.
The bloodshed was likely to
raise pressure on Israel to end
the fighting, even as it pledged to
intensify the offensive by strik-
ing the homes of wanted mili-
tants. High numbers of civilian
casualties in an offensive four
years ago led to fierce criticism
and condemnation of Israel.
In all, 73 Palestinians,
including 37 civilians, have
been killed in the five-day
onslaught. Three Israeli civil-
ians have also died from Pales-
tinian rocket fire.
The Israeli military carried
out dozens of airstrikes through-

out the day, and naval forces
bombarded targets along Gaza's
Mediterranean coast. Many of
the attacks focused on homes
where militant leaders or weap-
ons were believed to be hidden.
Palestinian militants con-
tinued to barrage Israel with
rockets, firing more than 100
on Sunday, and setting off air
raid sirens across the south-
ern part of the country. Some
40 rockets were intercepted
by Israel's U.S.-financed "Iron
Dome" rocket-defense system,
including two that targeted the
metropolis of Tel Aviv.
Israel's decision to step up
its attacks in Gaza marked a
new and risky phase of the
operation, given the likeli-
hood of civilian casualties in
the densely populated terri-
tory of 1.6 million Palestinians.
Israel launched the offensive
Wednesday in what it said
was an effort to end months of
intensifying rocket fire from
the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip.
In the day's deadliest vio-
lence, the Israeli navy fired
at a home where it said a top
wanted militant was hiding.

The missile struck the home
of the Daloo family in Gaza
City, reducing the structure to
rubble.
Frantic rescuers, bolstered
by bulldozers, pulled the limp
bodies of children from the
ruins of the house, includ-
ing a toddler and a 5-year-old,
as survivors and bystanders
screamed in grief. Later, the
bodies of the children were laid
out in the morgue of Gaza City's
Shifa Hospital.
More than a dozen homes of
Hamas commanders or families
linked to Hamas were struck
on Sunday. Though most were
empty - their inhabitants hav-
ing fled to shelter - at least
three had families in them. Al-
Kidra said 20 of 27 people killed
Sunday were civilians, mostly
women and children.
Israel sought to place the
blame on militants, saying they
were intentionally operating
in places inhabited by civil-
ians. The military has released
videos and images of what it
says are militants firing rock-
ets from mosques, schools and
public buildings.

Decision on
disputed land one
goal of gathering
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia
(AP) - Southeast Asian leaders
decided Sunday to ask China to
start formal talks "as soon as
possible" on crafting a legally
binding accord aimed at pre-
venting an outbreak of violence
in disputed South China Sea
territories, a top diplomat said.
Leaders of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations
made the decision during their
annual summit in Cambodian
capital Phnom Penh, ASEAN
Secretary-General Surin Pitsu-
wan said.
The South China Sea territo-
rial disputes, which many fear
could spark Asia's next war,
have overshadowed discussions
at the summit, where the top
agenda items included human
rights and expanding an Asian
free-trade area.
Four countries in ASEAN
- Brunei, Malaysia, the Phil-
ippines and Vietnam - have
been locked in long-unresolved
territorial rifts with China and
Taiwan in the resource-rich
waters, where a bulk of the
world's oil and cargo passes.
But fresh territorial spats
involving China, Vietnam
and the Philippines starting
last year have set off calls for
ASEAN and China to turn a
nonaggression accord they
signed in 2002 to a stronger,
legally-binding "code of con-
duct" aimed at discouraging
aggressive acts that could lead
to dangerous confrontations or
accidental clashes in the busy
region.
Vietnam and the Philippines
have separately accused China

since lastyear ofintrudinginto
South China Sea islands, reefs
and waters they claim and of
disrupting their oil explora-
tions well within their ter-
ritorial waters. China, which
claims virtually the entire
South China Sea, has dismissed
the protests.
China has sought one on one
negotiations with rival nations
to resolve the disputes, some-
thing that will give it advantage
because of its sheer size, and has
objected to any effort to bring
the problem to regional or inter-
national forums like ASEAN. It
has also warned Washington
not to get involved but Ameri-
can officials have declared that
the peaceful resolution of the
disputes and freedom of navi-
gation in the vast sea was in the
U.S. national interest.
ASEAN leaders, meanwhile,
adopted a human rights decla-
ration on Sunday despite last-
minute calls for a postponement
by critics, including Washing-
ton, who said the pact contains
loopholes that can allow atroci-
ties to continue.
ASEAN signed a document
adopting the Human Rights
Declaration in Phnom Penh.
The nonbinding declaration
calls for an end to torture, arbi-
trary arrests and other rights
violations that have been long-
time concerns in Southeast
Asia, which rights activists
once derisively described as
being ruled by a "club of dicta-
tors."
ASEAN diplomats have
called the declaration a mile-
stone in the region despite
its imperfections, saying it
will help cement democratic
reforms in countries such as
Myanmar, which until recently
has been widely condemnedfor
its human rights record.

Thousands march in honor
of woman denied abortion

Woman's death,
brings abortion
debate to forefront
in Ireland
DUBLIN (AP) - About
10,000 people marched
through Dublin and observed
a minute's silence Saturday in
memory of the Indian dentist
who died of blood poisoning
in an Irish hospital after being
denied an abortion.
Marchers, many of them
mothers and daughters walk-
ing side by side, chanted "Never
again!" and held pictures of
Savita Halappanavar as they
paraded across the city to stage
a nighttime candlelit vigil out-
side the office of Prime Minis-
ter Enda Kenny.
The 31-year-old, who was 17
weeks pregnant with her first
child, died Oct. 28 one week
after being hospitalized with
severe pain at the start of a mis-
carriage. Her death, made pub-
lic by her husband this week,
has highlighted Ireland's long
struggle to come to grips with
abortion.
Doctors refused her requests
to remove the fetus until its
heartbeat stopped four days
after her hospitalization. Hours
later she became critically ill
and her organs began to fail.
She died three days later from
blood poisoning. Her widower
and activists say she could have
survived, and the spread of
infection been stopped, had the
fetus been removed sooner.
The case illustrates a20-year-
old confusion in abortion law in
Ireland, where the practice is
outlawed in the constitution.
A 1992 Supreme Court ruling
decreed that- abortions should
be legal to save the life of the
woman, including if she makes
credible threats to commit sui-
cide if denied one. But succes-
sive governments have refused
to pass legislation spelling out
the rules governing'that general
principle, leaving the decision
up to individual doctors in an
environment of secrecy.

Kenny's government says it
needs to await the findings of
two investigations into Halap-
panavar's death before taking
any action. It has declined to
say if it will pass legislation to
make the 1992 judgment the
clear-cut, detailed law of the
land. Many doctors say they
fear being targeted by lawsuits
or protests - or even charged
with murder - if they perform
an abortion to safeguard a
pregnant woman's life.
Speakers from socialist par-
ties, women's groups and abor-
tion rights activists addressed
Saturday's crowd from atop a
flat-bed truck. They decried
the fact that two decades had
passed without any political
decision to define when hospi-
tals could, and could not, per-
form abortions.
"Twenty years is far too
long. Ignoring women's rights
is wrong!" the crowd chanted.
About 1,000 people staged
a more prayer-oriented rally
in the western city of Galway,
where the Halappavanars
settled in 2008. Some placed
candles spelling SAVITA on the
pavement in Galway's central
Eyre Square.
Halappanavar's husband
Praveen, took her body back to
India for a Hindu funeral ser-
vice and cremation Nov. 3 but
intends to return to his job as
a medical devices engineer at
Boston Scientific in Galway.
The Irish government's inac-
tion on abortion means that the
only law on the books dates to
British rule in 1861, declaring
that the "procurement of a mis-
carriage" amounts to murder
and could be punishable by up
to life in prison.
Irish voters in 1992 passed
constitutional amendments
legalizing the right of Irish
women to receive information
on abortion services in neigh-
boring England, where the
practice has been legal since
1967, and to travel there with-
out fear of facing prosecution.
British health authorities esti-
mate that 4,000 to 5,000 Irish
residents travel annually to
England for abortions.

Council calls for
rebels to stop, may
add sanctions
GOMA, Congo (AP) - A rebel
group believed to be backed by
Rwanda advanced to within two
miles of Goma, a crucial provin-
cial capital in eastern Congo,
marking the first time that rebels
have come this close since 2008.
Congolese army spokesman
Col. Olivier Hamuli said the
fighting has been going on since
6 a.m. Sunday and the front line
has moved to just a few miles
outside the city.
M23 spokesman Col. Vian-
ney Kazarama initially said the
rebels would spend the night in
Goma. In the afternoon after the
fighting stopped, he said, "We
can take Goma easily now, we
have pushed the Congolese army
back over 10 kilometers in one
day."
The M23 rebel group is made
up of soldiers from a now-
defunct rebel army, the National
Congress for the Defense of the
People, or CNDP, a group made-
up primarily of fighters from the
Tutsi ethnic group, the ethnicity
that was targeted in Rwanda's
1994 genocide.

'In the negotiations that fol-
lowed and which culminated in
a March 23, 2009, peace deal,
the CNDP agreed to disband and
their fighters joined the national
army of Congo. They did not
pick up their arms again until
this spring, when hundreds of
ex-CNDP fighters defected from
the army in April, claiming that
the Congolese government had
failed to uphold their end of the
2009 agreement.
Reports, including one by
the United Nations Group of
Experts, have shown that M23 is
actively being backed by Rwan-
da, which is providing financial
support, arms as well as fight-
ers. The reports indicate that the
new rebellion is likely linked to
the ongoing fightto control Con-
go's rich mineral wealth.
On Saturday, United Nations
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon
called Rwandan President Paul
Kagame "to request that he use
his influence on the M23 to help
calm the situation and restrain
M23 from continuing their
attack," according to peacekeep-
ing chief Herve Ladsous.
The latest clashes broke out
Thursday and led to the deaths
of at least 151 rebels and two sol-
diers. On Saturday U.N. attack
helicopters targeted M23 posi-
tions in eastern Congo.
In downtown Goma, panicked

residents came out to try to get
more information on what was
happening.
In their march toward Goma,
the M23 rebels caused an entire
refugee camp holding an esti-
mated population of 60,000 to
bolt. An Associated Press report-
er who traveled Sunday to the
front line saw the remains of the
refugee camp in Kanyaruchinya,
a village along the road to Goma.
All that remained in the
camp on Sunday afternoon were
personal belongings scattered
around skeletons of tents made
of eucalyptus branches, stripped
of their plastic sheets.
Reports by United Nations
experts have accused Rwanda,
as well as Uganda, of support-
ing the rebels. Both countries
strongly deny any involvement
and Uganda said if the charges
continue it will pull its peace-
keeping troops out of Soma-
lia, where they are playing an
important role in pushing out the
Islamist extremist rebels.
The U.N. Security Council
called for an immediate stop to
the violence following a two-
hour, closed-door emergency
meeting on Saturday. The coun-
cil said it would add sanctions
against M23 rebel leaders and
demanded that rebels immedi-
ately stop their advance toward
Goma.

Next president must put student interests first
ale University appointed its next president this month, but not
without controversy. There were serious concerns about some
selection committee members' close connections to large com-
panies like PepsiCo, Inc. The University of Michigan will also be choos-
ing a presi;lent soon as University President Mary Sue Coleman's contract
expires in 2014. In light of Yale's selection committee controversy, and
with the appointment of our university's leader fast approaching, the Uni-
versity should be careful to check the influence of business interests and
connections in order to make the best choice for students.

This is for all the haters who thought I was

Protest in un

Peter Salovey, who was appointed the next
president of Yale, will replace Richard C. Levin
in June. The search committee looked at about
150 candidates for the job. Eight corporation
fellows served on the search committee, such
as the president of Goodyear Capital Corpora-
tion and the former Chairman of the Board of
JPMorgan Chase.
The University has, in the past, made the
crucial decision to ensure that corporate inter-
ests were not present in the presidential search
committee. Over the course of her tenure,
Coleman has made sure those who have a large
stake in the University played a role in the most
significant decisions as opposed to those wield-
ing corporate ties. More importantly, none of
the members of the committee that elected her
in 2002 were tied to corporate interests. This
allowsthe searchcommittee to choose the best
possible candidate who will focus primarily on
the University, not on how University contracts
and partnerships will grow their business.
As far as the next president is concerned,
the committee should be looking for someone
with a controlling interest in the University
as an institution and who will act in student's
best interest. The University and its affiliates
deserve a president who will be an advocate for
the city of Ann Arbor and'who will be willing
to continue campus improvements Mary Sue

Coleman has championed. This broad, Univer-
sity-centered outlook could be lost if selection
committee members push corporate agendas
and interests.
There must be a separation of interests. The
committee chosen by the University to pick a
new president should take care to maintain
independence to ensure an affordable future
for every student.
Teresa Sullivan, the president of the Uni-
versity of virginia and former University of
Michigan provost, made headlines this year
due to spending cuts that would have re-orga-
nized the education system to be based around
"inexpensive, online education." The univer-
sity's controversy came because she could not
reconcile her vision of an academic institution
with visions of a corporation that educates.
This only goes to show that if a president is
influenced by outside interests, his or her abil-
ity to make good decisions for the University as
a whole may be compromised.
In the next few months, the University's
selection committee must make a key decision
about its future. When the University commu-
nity starts to think about the next president,
corporate interests shouldn't play a major role
in the search process. In the end, the commit-
tee must select a president who will help stu-
dents best achieve education and experience.

y eyes have been glued to
the computer screen for
days. The Israel Defense
Forces is live-
tweeting its
offensive, "Oper-
ation Pillar of
Defense," in the
Gaza Strip. Al-
Qassam Brigades
- the military
wing of Hamas -
responds in turn. DANIEL
And in an inter- CHARDELL
active map fea-
ture, Al Jazeera
tracks, aggregates and categorizes
social media posts coming from both
sides of the Gaza conflict.
The pace of escalating warfare is
fast, but the Internet is faster.
The ongoing conflict in Gaza has
spilled over into a new realm: social
media. As Yonah Lieberman wrote
in a column last Thursday, Face-
book was suddenly abuzz with posts
decrying or lauding Israel's opera-
tion in the Gaza Strip as the military
confrontation escalated. "Am Yisrael
chai," commonly translated as "The
nation of Israel lives," flooded my
newsfeed as friends sought to express
their enduring solidarity with Israel.
Meanwhile, others drew attention to
the growing number of Palestinian
civilian casualties and injuries.
But that wasn't all. In addition
to civilians caught in the crossfire,
the combatants themselves - the
IDF and Hamas - have taken to
Twitter, YouTube and Facebook in
their official capacities to simulta-
neously propagate their respective
narratives while rallying support
for their military campaigns.
I read news reports of skirmishes
along the Israeli-Gaza border early
last week, but the gravity of the situ-
ation was only brought to my atten-
tion on Wednesday, when one of my
Facebook friends shared a link to the
IDF YouTube account. There, the
IDF had posted a video of the "pin-
point strike" on Ahmed al-Jabari, the
top military commander of Hamas.
Only 10 seconds long, the video gives
a bird's-eye view of the bombing of
Jabari's car. One moment, the car is
there. The next, it's replaced with an
explosion and a cloud of smoke.
Some argue that the video vio-
lates the YouTube terms of service
because it depicts violence and
disturbing imagery. Indeed, after


enough users flagged the video as
inappropriate, it was removed for a
short time on Thursday morning. But
hours later, YouTube put the video
back up. When I last checked, the
video had more than 4 million views.
That same day, the IDF posted the
following Tweet: "We recommend
that no Hamas operatives, whether
low level or senior leaders, show
their faces above ground in the days
ahead." But the exploitation of social
media is not limited to the IDF alone.
In response, al-Qassam Brigades
responded: "Our blessed hands will
reach your leaders and soldiers wher-
ever they are (You Opened Hell Gates
on Yourselves)."
The role of social media in this
intensifying conflict has garnered
perhaps as much attention as the
conflict itself. "There have long
been the tools of warfare associ-
ated with the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict: warplanes, mortars, Qas-
sam rockets," writes Gerry Shih
of Reuters. "Now that list includes
Twitter, Facebook, YouTube."
In the short time since this con-
flict began, news websites and blogs
have published untold numbers of
articles deliberating the moral and
free speech implications of this
newborn phenomenon, war by way
of social media. Is it the responsi-
bility of tech giants like Google -
which owns Youtube - Facebook
and Twitter to restrict the flow of
threats and violent images? That
would be a good question, but given
the fact that the Jabari video still
stands, it seems that these compa-
nies have already demonstrated
their unwillingness to implicate
themselves in the messy business
of distinguishing "appropriate" vio-
lence from "inappropriate" blood-
shed. (Slippery slope? You betcha.)
Beside, I'm less interested in that
question. More important, I think, is
this: Does broadcasting warfare on
social media make it easier for us to
ignore, perhaps even dehumanize,
the other side? Let me put it more
bluntly: If you don'tsee photos of Pal-
estinian or Israeli corpses, are you
more easily able to escape the very
real human cost of conflict?
Dehumanization - the unwilling-
ness of either side to recognize the
existence of the other - is a hallmark
of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The enforced physical separation of
Israelis from Palestinians, Palestin-

ity
ians from Israelis, enables this. Social
media platforms minimize human-
to-human contact and maximize the
speed with which information flows.
When it comet to war, that's a dan-
gerous formula. In the safety of your
home, thanks to the Internet, you can
choose which stories to read, which
videos to watch. Thousands of miles
away from the actual conflict, you
can share this information even more
widely among your circle of like-
minded friends - support more vio-
lence with only a click of the mouse. I
don't care what your political beliefs
are. That's morally repugnant.

The pace of
warfare is fast,
but the Internet
is faster.-
Due to fear, hatred, politics or all
of the above, Israelis and Palestin-
ians cannot interact. Unfortunately, I
see that same dynamic at play on our
campus. I was thrilled, for example,.
to see students protesting on the
Diag on Thursday in response to the
escalating violence. But I was less
thrilled that these protests were lit- .
erally divided along political lines.
Pro-Israel students stood on one end
of the Diag, while pro-Palestine stu-
dents stood on the other.
I have strong feelings on this con-
flict, but that's.not the subject of this
column. For our current purposes,
my only opinion worth sharing is
that civilians, Israeli and Palestin-
ian, are the true victims. It's neces-
sary to distinguish combatant from
non-combatant. Under these circum-
stances, both are threatened. That
means we should protest not against
one another, but together.
I'd like to see interfaith events
held immediately to promote dia-
logue on these latest developments.
In the meantime, before you "like"
a post you see online, let's try to
remember that you're "liking" the
death of a real human.

Israel acted in defense

Between Saturday, Nov. 10 and Wednesday,
Nov. 14, various terrorist groups led by Hamas
firedmore than 100 rockets fromthe Gaza Strip
into civilian areas in Israel without justifiable
provocation. In response, Israel launched a
successful targeted assassination of Hamas
military leader Ahmed Jabari on Wednesday.
Jabari was responsible for planning numerous
terrorist attacks, as well as the kidnapping of
Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit.
Since the assassination on Wednesday,
Hamas terrorists have fired more than 800
rockets, striking numerous Israeli cities. Warn-
ing sirens blared across cities within range of
Gaza, allowing Israeli civilians only seven sec-
onds to seek cover before impact. For the first
time in more than 20 years, warning sirens
were sounded in Israel's largest and most
vibrant city, Tel Aviv.
The recent Hamas rocket fire is the latest
escalation between the group, classified by the
U.S. government as a terrorist organizaation,
and Israel. These rocket attacks are unfortu-
nately not out of the ordinary. Hamas has fired
at Israel relatively frequently since Israel unilat-
erally disengaged from the Gaza Strip in 2005
with hope for peace. Since the beginning of this
year, terrorists have fired more than 1,000 rock-
ets from Gaza into surrounding Israeli areas.
As an independent sovereign nation, Isrdel
is responsible for neutralizing such threats
to ensure the safety of its citizens. Thus, Isra-
el launched Operation Pillar of Defense on
Wednesday, the first offensive since Operation
Cast Lead in2008. Of course, no military opera-
tion is ideal, nor is the collateral damage caused
by such operations. Forceful intervention is the
last possible resort, but unfortunately there are
times when such attacks are necessary.
In regard to Israel's attempts to protect civil-
ians during Operation Cast Lead, Colonel Rich-
ard Kemp, the ex-Commander of British Forces
in Afghanistan, made the following statement

in front of the United Nations Human Rights
council: "Based on my knowledge and expe-
rience, I can say this: During Operation Cast
Lead, the Israeli Defense Forces did more to
safeguard the rights of civilians in a combat
zone than any other army in the history of
warfare." Israel continues to use all necessary
means to protect Gazan civilians in Operation
Pillar of Defense by dropping warning leaflets,
making personal telephone calls to civilians in
danger and even diverting missiles mid-air.
Israel is certainly not perfect. Still, every
country has a right and a responsibility to pro-
tect its civilians and defend itself as a sovereign
nation. Imagine that you are one of the one
million Israelis who have been forced to sleep
in a bomb shelter since Wednesday as a result
of Hamas aggression. Imagine that you live in
New York City and your neighbors in New Jer-
sey regularly shoot rockets into your neighbor-
hood. Israel is asking for nothing outrageous,
only an end to violence and a call for peace and
safety. Yet, how can there be an end to the vio-
lence when Hamas's charter explicitly calls for
the destruction of Israel?
As statuses, pictures and links to articles
blast our news feeds on Facebook, we must
question what we see, hear and know. Know
your facts. Know that Operation Pillar of
Defense is not an offensive act of aggression,
but rather adefensive response to attacks
that Hamas initiated. Know that this isn't a
recent flare-up - rather, it's an escalation of,
the constant danger that thousands of Israe-
lis and Palestinians live through on a daily
basis. Know that Israel is not only fighting
for the safety of its citizens, but also for the
hope that one day Hamas will abandon its
arms and its extremist agenda and join Isra-
el in the process towards peace.

ANDREW WRIGHT I VIEWPOINT
Student regent not a goal for 'U'

As the former chair of the Uni-
versity's student government Stu-
dent Regent Task Force, I read with
great interest The Michigan Daily's
editorial ("Students for Regents",
11/14/12). This idea isn't "new" or
"novel" as I, along with many other
members of student government,
have worked on such a proposal for
more than 40 years. From my time
working with the Regents, I can say
that the Daily's position that the
regents will voluntarily implement a
de-facto student regent is pollyanna-
ish. While attempting to work with
the Board of Regents - five of the
eight current regents were serving
at the time of my negotiations - all
of the regents opposed, in varying
degrees, the idea of a student serving
on the board.
After intense negotiation, the
regents finally agreed to designate
a chair in the room for the current
presidentof the studentbody. I, along
with many others at the time, consid-
ered this insulting at best. For exam-
ple, at the first meeting when this
position was instituted, the regents
had a lengthy discussion regarding
University Health Service in which
none of them ever addressed the
"student" representative.
The reasons provided by the
regents as to why a student should
not serve on the board ranged from
the offensive (students could never
understand nor appreciate the com-
plexities of the issues faced by the
Board of Regents) to the inane (stu-
dents would never be satisfied with
only one student representing them

so should we have several each rep-
resenting a different constituency,
such as non-traditional students,
commuter students, graduate and
undergraduate students, etc.).
A proposal from one of the current
regents actually suggested that we
create a petition, signedby more than
600 students representing 15 constit-
uencies at the University, before they
would consider a single student rep-
resentative of the campus commu-
nity. One regent - no longer serving
- did agree that a non-voting student
seemed like an idea the board should
at least "discuss." When this regent
mentioned the idea to University
administrators, they were told it was
inappropriate for regents to intro-
duce ideas to the board for consid-
eration - typically action items are
introduced by the executive officers.
The Daily is correct that many
states have student regents, but
what they don't note is that it's not
only other states, but other Michi-
gan universities as well. Michigan
State University has four student
regents, as do almost all Michigan
state schools. Additionally, Univer-
sity President Mary Sue Coleman
worked with a voting student regent
at the University of Iowa. After
working with the regents it became
clear that there was not only an
unwillingness, but outright hostility
to the addition of a student regent.
I don't share the Daily's optimism
that the two newregents - one afor-
mer president of LSA Student Gov-
ernment - will be able to reverse
the stance of the current board and

administration. While it would be
a vast institutional improvement
for students tobe involved and con-
sulted in regards to the policies and
priorities of the Board of Regents,
I'm doubtful that the regents would
ever cede power in this way. During
the time I served working on obtain-
ing the student body representation
on the board, I determined that the
only way-to achieve a student on the
board would be via constitutional
amendment. At the time, the Uni-
versity's student government con-
ducted a statewide poll of voters and
more than 80 percent of Michigan
citizens also supported the idea of a
voting student regent.
While I lament that the current
student government has not pur-
sued the extensive work performed
by their forerunners, I believe that
without constitutional reform the
Board of Regents will never have
the invaluable input of a student.
While many other institutions have
recognized the great value of a stu-
dent regent, why has the University
of Michigan not? If the University is
truly training its studentsto be "lead-
ers" why does it resist the notion that
students are capable of handling
the responsibilities of serving on
the board? It's time for the student
body to recognize that if they truly
desire representation on the Board
of Regents, they will have to fight
for that goal as opposed to passively
standing back and waiting for the
regents to "grant" them this right.

terback. Borges utilized Rob-
inson on screens, end arounds,
options, even a double reverse
at one point. Keeping track of
where he was on the field was
exhausting.
Of course, I don't mean to
dumb down the playbook, but the
essence of it was simply to get Rob-
inson in space and let him do what
he does best: make people miss.
On the last play of the first
quarter, Robinson took a handoff
moving left, broke contain and
raced up the sideline. Fifteen
yards ahead, Hawkeye safety
Tanner Miller rushed over to
force him out of bounds - Rob-
inson took one jab step toward
the middle of the field, faking a
cut back inside and Miller was
caught on his heels. Robinson
blew by down the sideline for
another 25 yards.
And the brilliance of Satur-
day's playbook was that even
though Robinson was the focal
point, he wasn't, and didn't need
to be, the star.
Gardner finished the game
18-of-23 passing for 314 yards

laughs from the audience.
MacKie-Mason explained
how Costolo began his work
with the Internet in 1996, ulti-
mately creating three compa-
nies. Costolo sold one company,
FeedBurner, to Google for $100
million in 2007. In 2009, Costolo
joined with Twitter as COO and
became CEO one year later.
The core of Costolo's presen-
tation discussed Twitter's ability
to reinvent the agora, a reference
to the ancient Greek meeting
place where citizens could gath-
er to discuss the latest politics
and news in their community.
Costolo described the ben-
efits of the Greek agora in creat-
ing functional discourse within
communities.
"It was multidirectional, it
wasn't someone standing on a
stage as I am with you dictat-
ing, so it was a conversation and
a real dialogue," Costolo said. "It
was unfiltered. The news was not
interpreted and written down
and handed to people. And it was
real time, you were hearing what
real people were talking about
right there with each other."
Costolo went on to chronicle
how the advent of radio and tele-
vision created a form ofdiscourse
that was "outside-in," removing
the ability for viewers to provide
their voice in the media.
"The fascinating thing about
these new technologies is they all
start out with the idea that they
are going to be multidirectional,
and we even get the illusion ...
with things like talk radio," Cos-
tolo said. "But of course, it really
is an illusion because there is an
editor who gets to call in ... and
we're only listening to the kinds
of conversation that come in from

people that agree with us."
Costolo said Twitter is help-
ing bring back multidirectional
forms of media.
"Along comes Twitter, and
Twitter re-invents the agora,"
Costolo said. "We once again start
to see multiple perspectives on
a particular news story or event
that's happening. We once again
start to have a shared experience
across the globe about what's
happening and what we're view-
ing now. We once again get an
unfiltered perspective of what's
happening. But, at the same time,
it complements all these tradi-
tional forms of broadcast media."
Cliff Martin, meeting and spe-
cial events planner at the Public
Policy School, said both schools
wanted to bring Costolo to speak
as Twitter becomes more impor-
tant in the world of policy and
news.
"(Costolo) certainly has ties to
the University so that's a draw,
but... (Twitter) is becoming a tool
that is increasingly useful in dis-
seminating policy information
and people's reactions," Mar-
tin said. "As we saw in the Arab
Spring, the response to Hurricane
Sandy, the way that the govern-

and three touchdowns, not
to mention his three rushing
touchdowns. He had tremendous
pocket presence and his throws.
were on point.
But Denard, who rushed
for 98 yards and picked up 24
more through the air on two
receptions, still gets some of
the credit there. Because even
when Denard isn't doing things
in the just-let-Denard-do-things
offense, the defense is preoccu-
pied with him.
In the final minute of the first
half, Michigan was driving just
inside the Iowa red zone. Gard-
ner was under center and Rob-
inson and senior running back
Vincent Smith were both lined
up in the full-house backfield.
Gardner faked the handoff to
Robinson, who ran right and took
the defense with him to that side
of the field. Smith, who-started
right, slipped back to the left side
of the field with blockers, and
Gardner hit him with the throw-
back screen..
There was a reason Smith
was able to practically walk into
the end zone. Robinson is that
distracting of a presence. After
the game, Gardner marveled at
how well the same play worked
in practice, when defensive end
Frank Clark shouted that he

knew what was coming and actu-
ally had no idea.
But perhaps the true genius of
this playbook was the fact that
Hoke, Borges and Co. broke it
out just a week before the Ohio
State game. Suddenly, an inactive
Denard Robinson is very much
active, and getting ready for that
will chew up much of the Buck-
eyes' game planning this week
(Robinson is distracting even
when it isn't Saturday).
Obviously I don't have the
football mind that Urban Meyer
possesses, but if I had to watch
film of Michigan this week and
develop a defense that could stop
the just-let-Denard-do-things
offense, I'd be scratching my
head.
Not surprisingly, Hoke denies
the implication that that played
any role in deploying the new
playbook this week. He just
wanted to give Michigan its best
chance to beat Iowa, yadda yadda
yadda.
Hoke is a bit too sly for me to
buy that. Regardless, Ohio State
lingers, and Michigan's new
playbook is a doozy. Just ask
fifth-year senior safety Jordan
Kovacs, who after the game said
that he's just happy he doesn't
have to play against Robinson in
this new offense on Saturdays.

Economic recovery
focus of conference

At 60th annual
event, experts
discuss financial
growth
By AUSTEN HUFFORD
Daily StaffReporter
The future is looking a little
less grim for students entering
the job market in the coming
years.
At the University's 60th
annual Economic Outlook
Conference on Thursday and
Friday, economists of the Uni-
versity's Research Seminar in
Quantitative Economics - a
unit in the Department of Eco-
nomics that forecasts state and
nation economic outlooks-
predicted moderate economic
growth and increased employ-
ment gains for Michigan and
the United States through 2014.
The two-day conference,
held in Rackham Amphitheatre,
revealed RSQE's predictions for
the state and national econo-
mies to attendees. Speakers
discussed a variety of economic
topics, such as the auto indus-
try, the European debt crisis,
national mortgage trends and a
possible Midwest labor short-
age.
RSQE director George Ful-
ton, who presented the Michi-
gan forecast, said the short-term
recovery is promising, but it has
not made up for long-termlosses
that started in 2000.
"It's not hard to feel upbeat
about the Michigan economy,"
Fulton said. "We are nearly
three years into a solid econom-
ic recovery after almost a full

decade of recession. The funda-
mentals seem to be in place for
the economy to keep expand-
ing."
Still, Fulton added that only
one-fifth of jobs lost since 2000
have been recovered and that
the salaries of Michigan's work-
ers are becoming less competi-
tive.
"It's a long haul to crawl out
of a deep hole but at least we
have stopped digging in deep-
er," Fulton said.
According to RSQE, national
and state unemployment rates
are expected to decline through
the end of 2014, which could
bode well for students seeking
employment post-graduation.
Michigan's unemployment
rate is expected to drop to eight
percent by 2014,a decrease from
9.1 percent in October 2012, and
job creation is expected to result
in about 49,000 new Michigan
jobs by 2013.
RSQE predicted a national
unemployment rate of 7.4 per-
cent at the end of 2014, com-
pared to 7.9 percent in October
2012. In 2013, the number of
people employed is predicted
to reach its pre-recession peak.
In addition to unemploy-
ment rate predictions, RSQE
assessed the state of the coun-
try's real Gross Domestic Prod-
uct - a measure of economic
output estimating the value
of all goods and services in
a country. RSQE predicted a
2-percent growth in real GDP
for 2013 and a growth of 2.6
percent for 2014, the highest
increase since 2010.
Richard Curtin - the direc-
tor of the University's Con-
sumer Sentiment Survey, a
monthly study that numerically

represents consumer attitudes
toward the market and prod-
ucts - said consumers have a
positive outlook on the future
of the economy despite nega-
tive economic indicators such
as high unemployment rates.
The Consumer Sentiment Sur-
vey is re-approaching long-
term averages for consumer
satisfaction with the economy.
"Wall Street and folks inside
the -Beltway just don't believe
that consumers can be so opti-
mistic, and consumers are quite
optimistic," Curtin said.
The conference also includ-
ed presentations from chief
economists at Freddie Mac,
Nationwide Mutual Insurance
and the Center for Automotive
Research and the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture, as well as
several University professors.
Fulton, who was primar-
ily responsible for organizing
the conference, said local and
regional members of govern-
ments, business people and
professors attended the confer-
ence to hear the predictions.
Fulton not-d that RSQE eco-
nomic predictions are not per-
fectly accurate because they
rely on assumptions, and when
some of those assumptions turn
out to be false, the final predic-
tions suffer. Still, Fulton said
the predictions are beneficial to
understanding the general eco-
nomic outlook.
"It's fairly accurate to say
that over the years we've done
a pretty good job," Fulton said.
"The question is not so much if
can you forecast things exactly,
because you can't, but the ques-
tion is can you become close
enough to be useful for thepeo-
ple that use it?"


ment is using Twitter to commu-
nicate within its own offices - it's
becoming still very much useful
in social aspects, but very impor-
tant in disseminating news and
information fast."
Costolo cited the use of
hashtags on television shows,
such as "The X-Factor," to aggre-
gate viewers around a certain
topic. On election night, Costolo
said more than 15,000 tweets per
second occurred over "extended
periods of time," showing how
Twitter acts as a complement to
television and current events.
"It's increasingly the case that
people realize that (Twitter) is
where the shared experience
happens while the broadcasters
are talking about or showing us
something else that's happening,"
Costolo said.
Costolo discussed the commu-
nication Twitter fosters between
"Very Important Tweeters" and
the ordinary citizen. He added
that conversations between peo-
ple in different spheres, like the
famous conversation between
Canadian rapper Drake and oil
tycoon T. Boone Pickens, could
not have occurred without Twit-
ter's agora.
"There's all this fascinating
change when the playing field is
completely leveled and everyone
speaks with the same volume and
the same access," Costolo said.
On a more serious note, Cos-
tolo discussed Twitter's global
relationship with governments
and policy, a topic at the forefront
of events such as the Arab Spring
and the current conflict between
Israel and Hamas.
Costolo showed a clip sampling
the mass amount of tweets sent
between Japan and other coun-
tries across the globe after the
March 2011 earthquake and tsu-
nami. He added thatcgovernments
plan to formally use Twitter as a
tool to help citizens in the event
of an emergency.
"Instantaneously, in the event
of a disaster, the government in
Japan has a mechanism they can
bring up on Twitter to communi-
cate with people and allow those
people to communicate with each
other," Costolo said. "Once we get
a good sense of how this is going
to work in Japan, we'll of course
take that capability around the
world. We've already got govern-
ments in the U.K. and Spain and
elsewhere wanting to leverage
that."
In Iran and China, Costo-
lo noted that the government
blocks Twitter. While he said
Twitter is not working to become
unblocked in Iran, it hopes the
service will b'e fully available in
China in the future. In regards to
the use of Twitter by Israel and
Hamas during the recent conflict
in Gaza, Costolo said there have
been no requests to remove any
tweets.
"As far as I know, we haven't
had any requests to take down
content there," Costolo said.
In an interview after the event,
Costolo discussed how Twitter is
evolving in order to keep up with

user inventions.
"The whole history of Twit-
ter is users invented the hashtag,
users invented '@' replies and the
'@' name, and we've improved
the technologies to support the
inventions that the users have
brought to the platform."
A new invention that Costolo
revealed is an archival system for
tweets. He told the audience that
by next year, users will be able to
download the "entire history of
your archived tweets."
LSA senior Carla Uhlarik, who
attended the event, said her own
use of Twitter brought her to
the presentation, and Costolo's
speech gave her new ideas for
using the platform.
"Twitter is used more as a
vis-a-vis medium for people. It's
more of a one-on-one interac-
tion," Uhlarik said. "(Costolo's
lecture) made me want to be
more proactive in the people I
follow. Maybe expandingbeyond
just NPR ... and branching to also
like celebrities, because it kind
of gives you a grander scope of
what is going on in the world."
LSA senior Wenjie Zhu, an
international student from
China, said he personally doesn't
use Twitter because he isn't
accustomed to having the oppor-
tunity.
"Honestly I just don't feel
accustomed to have a voice,
that's how I feel about it," Zhu
said.
School of Information gradu-
ate student Benjamin Olger said
before the lecture that he was
excited to hear what Costolo had
to say about his field of study.
"I'm studying human comput-
er interaction and I'd like to be a
user experience designer," Olger
said. "I'm not necessarily sold
on working on any particular
product, but it would definitely
be really cool to work on a social
media platform."
After his speech, Costolo
noted how new jobs in the mar-
ketplace will reflect the increas-
ing popularity of social media.
"(Social media) is only going
to grow ... and you're seeing the
emergence of all sorts of new
kinds of social platforms like
Instagram and Snapchat," Cos-
tolo said. "And as younger gener-
ations specifically are concerned
less and less about 'Well, I would
never share that information'
and they do it frictionlessly,
there will be more and more
social media companies, servic-
es, platforms and opportunities."
Costolo closed his lecture
by answering a question from
the audience: "What's the most
important piece of advice you've
ever received?"
"It only makes sense to do
what you want to do and what
you're passionate about, because
that will be how you end up at
a place where looking back, you
can connect the dots and see
you landed where you wanted to
land," Costolo said. "And I mean,
you're not going to hear from
anyone who that's more true
than from me."


LANDMARK

lounge, theater room and fitness
center.
Gina Cowart - a representative
for American Campus Commu-
nities, the company that bought
the building from the original
contractor, Campus Acquisitions,
last month - said progress on the
remaining construction, while
visible, has been slow.
"Although we feel strides have
been made, we are disappointed
with the pace of their progress,"
Cowart said.
Though Campus Acquisitions
is responsible for completing the
construction they started, Cow-
art added that ACC has worked
to alleviate the woes of the build-
ing's residents, and gave each
resident a $500 Visa gift card as
a "goodwill gesture." Residents,
were also offered the opportunity
of takinga $500 rent reduction in
lieu of a gift card.
"We understand that our resi-
dents were also frustrated with
all the amenities not being com-
pleted at move-in," Cowartsaid.
All of the retail spaces on the
ground floor of the building have
been leased out and vendors are
working to build their own spaces
to accommodate individual needs,
Cowart said. Retailers such as

7-Eleven, World ofBeer, Tim Hor-
tons and No Thai! are expected to
open at the beginning of spring
term, which starts in May.
Other minor issues, includ-
ing broken toilet paper holders,
missing bed frames and mis-
matched windows, were fixed
by ACC shortly after move-
in, according to Art & Design
senior Erica Neumann, a Land-
mark resident. Despite the lack
of promised amenities, Neu-
mann and other students said
the building is still enjoyable.
"You could tell that it was
built in a rush," Neumann
said. "But nothing that really
changed the living experience
to the point where we weren't
enjoying ourselves. It was just
little things. We had to call
maintenance and they would
come up and fix it."
LSA junior Shaun Dass said
at move-in, only two of the four
elevators were working for the
approximately 600 residents,
creating a "madhouse." Despite
the challenges, Dass said ACC has
been cooperative in fixing prob-
lems as theyarise and now doesn't
wait more than five minutes for
an elevator. Though he said the
struggle of waiting for an eleva-
tor has been somewhatalleviated,
the building could benefit from
additional elevators.
Dass added it is frustrating
that the entertainment deck is not

accessible because even if it does
open soon, he most likely will not
use it because of the cold weather.
After the chaotic move-in,
LSA junior Manuj Rattan said
the building staff has worked
hard to fix issues and install
improvements.
"It was a little crazy the first
few weeks because stuff was
still being built," Rattan said.
"But now it's fine, everything's
settled in, everything's good."
LSA senior Matthew Blecker,
who also lives in Landmark, said
although he is disappointed that
the retail spaces on the ground
floor are still not ready, living in
Landmark has been pleasant.
"Out of the other options to
living on campus, I would still
probably choose Landmark,"
Blecker said.
LSA junior Ryan Fereydouni
said he is content with the liv-
ing situation in Landmark, and
feels his priorities have been
met, such as the quality of his
room and the convenient location.
He added that the amenities that
are finished, such as the gym, are
"unreal."
"Overall they've been pret-
ty accommodating," Ferey-
douni said, "but they definitely
shouldn't have crammed it in the
timethey did. Nextyear everyone
should move in there, I have no
complaints for that. Right now we
just got the shaft."

The Council is also poised to
vote on an agreement with the

The organization provides
housing for families who have

resolution, sponsored by Coun-
cilmember Higgins, requires
eight votes to pass. The Univer-
sity would have to pay the city for
"right-of-way" agreements on the
property.

The resolution is requesting
that Liberty Street - between
South Ashley Street and South

and West Washington streets -be
closed offto traffic on April7,2013.
A resolution is also on the
agenda to close streets for Fool

tival on April 5, 2013. For that
festival, which takes place from
dusk until midnight, Washing-

between 1st and Main streets,
and Ashley Street would be
closed between Washington
and Liberty streets.

Heavenly 'Halo 4'

Artistic puppet theater
thrives in Detroit

Sequel revives story
arc, hits all the
right notes
By JULIAN AIDAN
Daily Arts Writer
It has been five years since
"Halo 3." Master Chief has taken
the backseat since the finale of the
massively suc-
cessful game,
while titles
like "Wars," Halo 4
"Reach" and
"ODST" have Xbox 360
focused on 343 Industries
developing a
backstory for
the Spartans and allowing mul-
tiplayer to evolve. Now, he's back
and kicking ass like he never
went into retirement.
Suddenly awoken by Cortana,
your (mostly) trusty AI pal from
the last few games, the player
finds that colliding headfirst
into an alien-made planet is
about as unpleasant as it seems.
The planet, Requiem, acts as the
backdrop for most of the action
in "Halo 4." Pulling from all
sources of the canon - the ani-
mated series "Halo Legends,"
all previous games and even the
novels - the story in "Halo 4" is
by far the most developed and
complex.
The Covenant are back and
as much of a pain as ever, with
Jackals taking potshots at the
player from a distance and Hunt-
ers taking chunks out of every-
thing within range, exactly as
they have been since the series'
inception.
A new class of enemies - Pro-
metheans - fights for the Fore-
runners, who die-hard "Halo"

"Hey, wait for me!"
lore experts will remember as
the architects behind the original
Halo construct. They wield zany
new Forerunner-technology
equivalents of familiar weapons
such as the shotgun and pistol
and are the primary opponent
players will run into on Requiem.
As far as gameplay goes,
though, it's the same ol' run-and-
gun that "Halo" players know
and love. Four difficulties, from
Easy to the fearsome Legendary,
and gameplay modifiers ranging
from Catch (enemies throw tons
of grenades) to Grunt Birthday
Party (scoring a headshot on a
Grunt enemy will cause an explo-
sion of confetti) make replaying
your favorite levels with differ-
ent settings an extremely fun and
satisfying experience.
As expected, the multiplayer
for "Halo 4" is rock-solid. Play-
ers can now sprint without the
requirement of a perk, as they
did in "Reach," instead of sac-
rificing a play-style altering
ability like deployable sentries,
stealth, jetpacks or additional
shields. "Spartan Ops" replaces
the immensely popular Firefight
mode from "ODST" and "Reach,"

providing new and 'challenging
missions every week.
The War Games mode of multi-
player allows players to delve into
the white-knuckle combat that
has become synonymous with
the franchise. The new perks and
weaponry add just enough inno-
vation so veterans will not feel
lost amid five years of changes
without inherently changing
how the game is played: kill or
be killed in no-holds-barred
Deathmatches, or outmaneuver
enemies in Capture the Flag-type
games. A loadout system similar
to "Call of Duty" rewards players
based on performance and expe-
rience gained throughout match-
making.
"Halo 4" is everything gamers
could have hoped and dreamed
for in a true continuation of the
series. With Neil Davidge's com-
position providing spot-on music
for the epic, high-intensity game-
play, the game looks and plays
beautifully while managing not
to feel like a rehash of an 11-year-
old series about shooting things
in the face. Master Chief is back
and kicking alien ass in the best
way possible.

A lot comes to mind when
people think about Detroit: cars,
Motown, segregation, blight,
industry - the list goes on. While
these subjects are highly visible
parts of Detroit and its history,
sometimes smaller, more niche
interests in the city are forgotten
in the many discussions about the
city and its future.
Puppetry is one of those inter-
ests. Detroit is home to a small but
resilient puppetry scene, one that
has held up - even thrived - in
the tough economic times the city
has faced.
Detroit-based organization
PuppetART runs a theater, muse-
um and studio all dedicated to
puppetry. The organization per-
forms and commissions puppet
theater from the community.
The organization's show,
"Dreamtigers," is commissioned
,from another theater ensemble
called The Hinterlands. "Dream-
tigers" is based on the works of
Latin American authors who
write in the style of magical
realism, such as Gabriel Garcia
Marquez and Octavio Paz.
Established in 1998, Puppe-
tART was foundedby theater per-
formers from the former Soviet
Union.
"Back in Russia, we worked in
the theater mostly performing
puppetry, so puppetry.is our pro-
tection," said Igor Gozman, one
of the co-founders of PuppetART.
"When we came here, we did the-
ater work mostly for ourselves,

The Michigan Daily - michigandailycom Monday, November19, 2012 - 7A

NBC, are you OK?

The signs were all there.
The unceremonious
expulsion of Ann Curry
from "The Today Show," the
fault-ridden coverage of the
2012 London
Summer
Olympics, the
downright
disrespect-
ful handling
of Conan
O'Brien's
ousting, the KAYLA
renewal of UPADHYAYA
"Whitney."
Yes, NBC
has set itself on a course of self-
destruction. The peacock has lost
its damn mind.
It's not easy for me to admit
this. After all, NBC has played a
formative role in my collegiate
life. Freshman year, my room-
mate and I welcomed our new
friends into our cluttered dorm
room on Thursday nights for
NBC's beloved comedy lineup
and again on most Saturdays
for "Saturday Night Live." The
people who came to these gather-
ings, who plopped on our beds
with their Oreos and popcorn,
who laughed with us at every Liz
Lemon "blergh" and Ron Swan-
son glare, are the same people
I now live with. I'm not saying
NBC is the reason I have friends
... but yes, that's exactly what I'm
saying.
The disjointed handling of
"Community" is particularly
bizarre. Outcry from frustrated
fans on Twitter has been heart-
felt, but hardly informative,
so here's the rundown: NBC
announced this summer that the
show would move from its Thurs-
day position to Friday night - or,
as it's otherwise known, Where
TV Goes To Die - and would
receive only a half-season order.
The network also fired the brain
of the series, Dan Harmon, and
replaced him with the talented-
but-safer David Guarascio and
Moses Port. At the last minute,
NBC decided to delay the fall
premiere date to Feb. 7. The only
good news that comes of this wait
time is "Community" will at least
reside where it belongs: in prime
realty on Thursday nights.
The folks at NBC seem to
have no idea what they're doing
this year, but the current "Com-
munity" saga is actually history
repeating itself Let's take it all
the way back to 1966, when a
brand new, obscure sci-fi series
entered NBC programming: "Star

Trek."

(No one could keep a scene star-

And all the relationship dynamics
are sorted satisfactorily.
The sex scenes were as good as
PG-13 can get - which isn't saying
much - but it's nice to see a film
aimed at young adults portray a
married couple as having a pas-
sionate sex life (albeit a married
vampire couple, but it's stilla step
up). Meanwhile,the gooey expres-
sions of love between Stewart and
Pattinson made par, but only just.
The real treats of this movie are
the unexpected ones - much of
this film was directed by expec-
tation, and expectation does not
make an exciting director.
"The Twilight Saga: Breaking
Dawn - Part 2" fulfills its prom-
ises. If you have no love for the
characters, this retelling will not
force attachment on you, but the
film is sweet in all facets. It revels
in lovely, winter-oriented cinema-
tography, and there are no out-
standing flaws for the legions of
fans and haters to pounce on.
"Breaking Dawn," in full com-
mitment to its teen-romance roots,
retains the appealing quality of
making the audience feel as though
they are spectating fromthe inside
of a small, intimate world - ,'as
though the whole of Bella's and
Edward's romance were an inside
joke, and the audience is in on it.
That feeling of intimacy, however
plastic, however commercialized,
is still there for the people who
want it to be, and that seals the
deal for this franchise. Job well
done - hatersgonnahate.

TV/NEW MEDjA.NTEOK
The fate of web series
like 'Cybergeddon'

'Ragnarok' offers mythic
thrills for devoted players

By KELLY ETZ
Daily TV/New Media Editor
Less than two months ago,
"Cybergeddon," a cybercrime-
centered web series created by,
Anthony Zuiker of "CSI" fame,
debuted on Yahoo!'s online Screen
channel.
No one noticed.
That same week, at least five
"Gangnam Style" remix videos
went viral.
More than four million views
each.
"Cybergeddon" cost six mil-
lion to produce, making it the
most expensive web series ever
created. Those "Gangnam Style"
remix videos? Probably less than
five dollars total.
What's going wrong here? It's
obvious people like to watch vid-
eos online; it's how YouTube and
Hulu make all that dough. I can't
even remember the last time I sat
down and watched a TV show on
an actual television - probably
around the last time I popped a
CD into my Walkman. OK, that
might have been a slight exagger-
ation. But, seriously, it has been a
longtime.
The production quality ofthese
web series is no joke, and it isn't
as if they can't pull the big names.
Toni Hanks produced a web
series for Yahoo!, and Ben Stiller
has starred in one. It just begs one
question: Why doesn't anyone
care?

ed heavily in original content,

FILM REIEW
Legendary 'Lincoln'

Mulling over mashed
potatoes and gravy

Spielberg flawlessly
captures humanity
in politics, war
By CARLY KEYES
Daily Arts Writer
More often than not, ruining.
the end of a film will ruin the rea-
son to watch it. But in "Lincoln,"
the surprise is
certainly not*
in the ending
- it's in every -incoln
thing that takes
place before it. At Qualityl6
There's much and Rave
more to the life
of the sixteenth Dreamworks
President of the
United States than what's written
in American history textbooks.
It's time to get "honest" about
Abe.
Steven Spielberg ("War Horse")
directs this poignant period piece
that takes place at the end of the
Civil War, as Lincoln strives for
a peace treaty and the abolish-
ment of slavery. The film opens
with a muddy battle of bayonettes
and boots, gruesome close-ups of
spearing and stomping on faces
n the murky water. But Spiel-
berg takes the viewer behind the
scenes of the government rather
than enemy lines with two rivet-
ing, interwoven storylines: Lin-
coln's perspective as both a family
man and commander-in-chief,
and the House of Representatives
as it debates the fervently contest-
ed Thirteenth Amendment.
Spielberg recreates the era
using simple cinematography,
so the film functions more like a
documentary than a Hollywood
production. But his most impres-
sive achievement -proving why
he's one of the best at his craft - is
doingthe impossible: He portrays
politicians as human.
Despite power and rever-
ence, Lincoln (Daniel Day-Lewis,
"Nine") is also a tall man in a top

hat who lies on the floor with
his youngest son, helps his wife
(Sally Field, "The Amazing Spi-
der-Man") out of her corset and
forbidshis eldest son (Joseph Gor-
don-Levitt, "Looper") to enlist in
the Union army. Coated in affabil-
ity, he shares touching, personal,
thought-provoking anecdotes
with everyone from his cabinet to
Negro soldiers - awesome exam-
ples of the inventive dialogue
by Tony Kushner ("Munich"),
partially adapted from the book
"Team of Rivals: The Political
Genius of Abraham Lincoln" by
Donna Kearns Goodwin. At one
point, the Union battle strategist
runs out of the room screaming
because he just can't handle yet
another "Lincoln Lesson."
Day-Lewis's performance is
like a cinematic resurrection. He
doesn't act like Lincoln - he is
Lincoln.
But it's not just Lincoln carry-
ing the film - he's flanked by an
uncensored mob of unruly politi-
cians. If government proceedings
today were anything like this,
C-SPAN could televise pay-per-
view specials and make a killing.
These stately scholars behave like
schoolyard boys as they spend as
much time tossing crass insults
and embarrassing epithets around
the room as they do productively

debating.
Tommy Lee Jones ("Emperor")
as the radical Republican congres-
sional leader is naturally one of
the worst offenders. Comedy con-
tinues when the secretary of state
(David Straitharn, "The Bourne
Legacy") recruits three men to
bribe Democrats to support the
bill. James Spader ("Shorts") plays
ringleader as the conniving trio
both succeeds and fails in a series
of hilarious scenes. Jokes and plot
thicken as Democrats must now
combat their own kind who have
hopped the fence. The brimming
buffoonery in the narrative pro-
vides refreshing relief from the
gravity of the overarching subject
matter.
The best film is the kind that
ends way too soon, and when
this one does come to a close,
Lincoln's death consumes less
than five minutes of screen time.
The brilliance of "Lincoln" is in
the journey, not the destination.
It sets itself apart from the aver-
age war biopic by showcasing the
human elements of its characters.
A soldier is also a son, a politician
is also a husband and a president
is also a father. There's a lot more
to people than their title and what
they do - it's far more important,
and cinematically gripping, to
manifest who they are.

bashing the eats in Ann

modus operandi, I'm shifting

dinner in no time. In this third
installment of my five-part
Thanksgiving series, we're
whipping together every kid's

No Thanksgiving meal is

ous glug of gravy. I would know.
I still remember - like an

and satisfied stomachs.
Mashed Potatoes Ingredients:
5 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes
1/2 cup (1 stick) softened butter
4 ounces softened cream
cheese
4 ounces sour cream
1/a cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon kosher salt (plus
more, to taste)
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground
black pepper
Directions:
Peel the potatoes and chop

them into rough, two-inch
cubes. Better yet, find some-
one else to do this for you.
Throw them into a large pot
and cover with cold water. The
reason we're using cold water -
besides it being unnecessarily
dangerous to kerplunk chunks
of potato into boiling water - is
that they cook more evenly this
way. Bring the water to a boil,
reduce the heat to a simmer
and cook for approximately 30
minutes.

PASSIN..G THIE TORCHI

Michigan 42, Iowa 17

Gardner shines,
Robinson ignites
offense at QB, WR
and RB in victory
By ZACH HELFAND
Daily SportsEditor
The Michigan football world
turned again on Saturday. It was
an end and a beginning, the clos-

ing of a spellbinding chapter of
Michigan football and an emphat-
ic statement for the future.
Denard Robinson is gone,
another casualty of the unrelent-
ing spinning of the college football
world. The senior will play again,
but never again in Michigan Sta-
dium.
The past and the future con-
verged in Michigan's 42-17
thrashing of Iowa. Robinson and
junior quarterback Devin Gardner
shared the spotlight.

"This is his team," said Michi-
gan coach Brady Hoke, referring
to Robinson. "Him and Kovacs
and all the seniors have a big piece
of it, but Devin said it the other
day. He has been the face of Michi-
gan football."
One thousand, one hundred
and sixty-nine days after he intro-
duced himself to the Big House
crowd with a broken-play touch-
down against Western Michigan,
Robinson played his last game
at Michigan Stadium. The final

game was just as exotic and elec-
trifying as the first, two irregular
bookends to a dazzling career at
quarterback.
"It's kind of hard to swallow
right now because it's coming to
an end," Robinson said. "It's hard
to put into words what this means
to me."
Robinson had missed the previ-
ous two weekswith an elbow inju-
ry, but he got the start on senior
day. It just wasn't at quarterback.
Robinson took several snaps at

quarterback, but he started at
running back and played most of
the game there. He didn't throw a
pass, but he gained 98 yards on 13
carries and caught two passes for
24 yards. ,
Senior day, though, belonged to
Gardner. The quarterback-turned-
receiver-turned-quarterback had
his most impressive performance
yet. He scored six total touch-
downs --three throughthe air and
three on the ground. He threw for
314 yards on 18-for-23 passing and_

ran for another 37. Behind Gard-
ner's arm and Robinson's legs,
Michigan scored on each posses-
sion for the first three quarters.
"(Gardner) had six touch-
downs? Did he really?" Hoke
asked after the game. Then he con-
ceded thatcGardner'sperformance
"was pretty good."
The Wolverines had little trou-
ble with the reeling Hawkeyes,
who had lost four straight games
entering Saturday's contest. But

Fifth-year senior wide receiver Roy Roundtree celebrates with fans in the student section after Michigan's victory.
Roundtree, Gallon re*-
emerge as deep threats

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
A jubilant Roy ttoundtree
bounced back to the Michigan
sideline after hauling in a 37-yard
touchdown pass from Devin
Gardner to put the Wolverines
ahead of Iowa for good in the sec-
ond quarter Saturday atMichigan
Stadium.
Playing in his final game at the
Big House, Roundtree had just
caught his second touchdown
of the season, and his first since
Week 3. He rushed toward his
teammates to celebrate on the
sideline, then stopped short.

He spotted Paul Schmidt, the
team's head trainer, and gave him
a wide smile.
"Visualize," Roundtree told
Schmidt.
Visualize. It was a concept
Schmidt preached to Roundtree
all season, accordingto Michigan
radio analyst Doug Karsh, who
relayed the story on the broad-
cast. The snap, the route, the
catch. Visualize.
It was a proper send-off for
Roundtree, a fifth-year senior
whose peak at Michigan came
when he was a sophomore, pull-
ing in 72 catches for 935 yards and
seven touchdowns. In the two

years since then, he has just four
scores on 44 catches, never com-
ing close to his second-year totals.
And sometime before the
Michigan football team broke fall
camp three months ago, Gardner
supplanted Roundtree.
Roundtree, wearing Desmond
Howard's No. 21 legend jersey,
was expected to flourish at flank-
er this fall despite a disappointing
2011 season.
But Gardner made the tran-
sition from quarterback - his
natural position - to receiver and

Afina, fondfarewellfor 'Team 133' seniors

The final chapter is always
the hardest to put down.
The Michigan football
team's 18 seniors bade farewell'to
Michigan Stadium for the final
time with a 42-17 victory over
Iowa on Saturday. They each
exited differently, each lingered
longer than the man before.
Craig Roh
walked side--
by-side across
the field with
Will Camp-
bell, burning
a hole in the ,
turf with his
blank down-
ward stare. STEPHEN J.
He looked up, NESBITT
gazed up at
the rows and
rows of emptying bleachers.
Jordan Kovacs took his time,
slowly blazing a path to the tun-
nel. When he got there, he spread
his arms wide to greet fans on
both sides of the entrance with a
high-five.
"It was bittersweet," Kovacs
said. "Obviously, it was a big win
for us. That was exciting. For
it to be the last time in The Big
House, I'm not ready for it to
end. It's been quite the journey,
and I'm ready to ride it out."
But before they stepped off
the field, they each looked back.
They looked to see the iconic
block 'M' at midfield once more.
They looked to admire the his-
toric stadium in which 112,000
watched them win 14 games
and lose none in the past two
seasons. They looked to see who
came after.
Kenny Demens came after,
followed by Steve Wilson, J.T.
Floyd and Roy Roundtree, each
leaving a legacy behind him
as he stepped off the turf and
started up the tunnel.
Finally there was only one

locker room.
Brown is still a familiar name,
but he comes from a different
time, a darker time.
Brown spent four seasons at
Michigan, enduring the rapid
down-trend when Rich Rodri-
guez took the reins from Lloyd
Carr as head coach. He was here
when Roh was a true freshman
trying to get his feet under him
asa starter. He was here when
Kovacs was just joining the team
as a student-body walk-on. He
was here when Robinson was
just a blip on the radar, a backup
quarterback to Tate Forcier.
There are no do-overs in col-
lege football, no second chances
at finishing things right. Brown's
senior day was a 21-10 loss to
Ohio State, a merciful end to a
five-game losing streak to close
his career. That's not the way he
ever dreamt it would end.
There's a reason Hoke says
this is the seniors' team and
charges them to lead. They don't
get a second chance, and they'll
fight harder than those who
higan fans. have a next year. They are guar-
anteed nothing. Nothing other

Senior quarterback Denard Robinson finished his career at Michigan Stadium with the same flashes of brilliance that have endeared hirrto Mic

left. It was the man who filled
the stadium when Michigan
couldn't field a team worth
watching. The one who tran-
scends the quarterback position,
the alpha position in college
athletics, and does it all with a
smile. The one whose swan song
ended with an ESPN interview
at center stage of the largest
stage in the country.
Denard Robinson closed his
final chapter at Michigan Sta-
dium just the way he should.
The flicker in his eyes re-lit,
Robinson trotted past throngs
of adoring fans and disappeared
into the darkness of the tunnel
for the final time.

They didn't all make the same
impact.
Jack Kennedy only took snaps
when stadiums had been half-
emptied and TVs were shut off.
But everyone was watching as
Kennedy, not Robinson or Devin
Gardner, led the offense to lead
Michigan onto the field for the
last snap.
Kennedy took the snap,
hesitated and dipped his right
knee to the turf. As the last
seconds started to tick off the
clock, Kennedy spun to the man
behind him in the victory forma-
tion, grinned and embraced him.
It was Joe Reynolds, a redshirt
junior receiver, and the two
know each other better off the

field than they do on it. Kennedy
used his last season to follow
another passion and kickstart a
band with Reynolds they later
dubbed 'JDK and Rey.'
Senior day is a bittersweet
occasion. You realize that they
don't all have futures in football.
Hardly any of them do. In pro-
fessional football, there's always
next year. On senior day, there
rarely is a next year.
College graduation is billed
as "commencement" - a new
beginning. Senior day is any-
thing but. For a lot of these guys,
they don't flip the channel and

Michigan falls to No. 1
Akron in 2nd round

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan hockey team
didn't want to believe that
things could any worse this
weekend.
After all, they had already
lost 3-1
to No. NOTRE DAME 3
7 Notre MICHIGAN 1
Dame on -- --
Friday, NOTRE DAME 4
when MICHIGAN 1
the 12th-
ranked Wolverines collapsed
under themselves.
Though visibly distressed
over the loss, at least there was
some hope for Michigan that
things could turn around the
next night.
But hope doesn't always
translate into results, and the
Wolverines fumbled their way
to a 4-1 loss, the first time they'd
been swept at Yost Ice Arena
this season.
"I think our team came out
(tonight) with renewed ener-
gy," said Michigan coach Red
Berenson. "They felt bad about
last night's game and they
wanted to make up for it, and
they.couldn't do it.
"We just couldn't get the
offense going and it was a
defensive battle."
The first period had the mak-
ing of a picture-perfect stanza,
with crisp passes and consid-
erate puck handling in both
zones - a far cry from the slop-
piness that tore Michigan (2-5-1
CCHA, 4-6-1 overall) apart the
night before.
Considering Michigan's
man advantage was abysmal
on Friday, it wasn't necessarily
comforting to them when they
took the first-power play of the
night. The Wolverines' power
play unit stayed solid through-
out the first frame - even if it
wasn't scoring goals, at least it
wasn't giving them up.
But it was the other special-
teams unit that faltered first,
when Notre Dame (5-1, 8-3)
scored a power-play goal with
a snipe from the point midway
through the frame.

AKRON, Ohio - No match
against Akron, the perennial
NCAA men's soccer power, is
ever the most pleasant experi-
ence. But the Michigan men's
soccer team
may have AKRON 2
caught MICHIGAN 1
the Zips
at the worst possible time - in
the midst of a 14-game winning
streak.
Top-ranked Akron added
another tally to its tremendous
streak on Sunday night, edging
out the Wolverines, 2-1, in the
second round of the NCAA tour-
nament. The Zips haven't lost
a match since Sept. 9, and they
have outscored their opponents
by a staggering 36-2 margin dur-
ingthat span.
Redshirt sophomore goal-
keeper Adam Grinwis may have
played the best match of his
career for the Wolverines, but
Akron proved too much for the
improved Michigan defense. The
Zips (7-0 MAC, 18-1-2 overall)
controlled most of the possession
throughout the match, leading
to numerous plays that showed
off their crafty footwork and ball
skills.
"We did some the best stuff
early on in the second half that
I've ever seen out of any Akron
team I've had," said Akron
coach Caleb Porter. "Some of
the sequences and combinations
were fantastic."
Grinwis kept Michigan (5-3-
1 Big Ten, 11-10-1) in the game
after making a string of crucial
saves in the last 10 minutes of
the initial frame, each coming
from point-blank range inside
the 18-yard box. But even Grin-
wis's extraordinary performance
wasn't enough to keep the Zips
scoreless heading into halftime.
In the 43rd minute, it was mid-
fielder Eric Stevenson who struck
a laser to the top right corner giv-
ing Akron a 1-0 advantage just
before the break.
In the secondhalf,Grinwiswas
even more impressive, making
six out of his nine saves against
the Zips' relentless attack.

"Adam made some superb
saves in the second half that defi-
nitely kept us in the game," said
Michigan coach Chaka Daley. "I
think both keepers were excel-
lent tonight."
But the Wolverines' defense
faltered again in the 59th minute
when Akron forward Thomas
Schmitt chipped a loose ball over
Grinwis to give his team a 2-0
lead. To make matters worse for
Michigan, three minutes later,
freshman forward Colin McAtee
was shown a red card for stomp-
ing on an Akron defender follow-
ing a hard tackle.
On top of a two-goal deficit,
the Wolverines were down to ten
men on the field for the second
time this season against Akron.
But a minute later, off the ensu-
ing free kick, freshman forward
James Murphy revitalized the
Michigan squad after striking a
rocket into the left side of the net
to cut the Zips' lead to one.
"It was a little ironic," Daley
said regardingthe quick goal fol-
lowing the red card.
Perhaps it was a bit strange,
but more importantly for the I
Wolverines, Murphy's strike
meant they still had a chance.
After McAtee's red card,
the Wolverines showed more
urgency than it had in the first
sixty minutes of the match.
Daley switched formations to
push more attackers toward
the Akron goal, but goalkeeper
David Meves sealed the deal
for the Zips, as he made a leap-
ing save from junior midfielder
Fabio Pereira's shot with just
four minutes left.
"It looked good off of
(Pereira's) foot," Daley said. "It
looked like it was going in the
top pocket, but (Meves) got his
hand to it and he made a great
save."
The Wolverines' season may
be over, but Daley said that this
season, his first at Michigan, has
been a great experience for him-
self and the team.
"As a new coach, and to get
buy-in from your team, I think
our guys have grown a lot (dur-
ing the season)," Daley said.
"There will be better days for
Michigan soccer for sure."

see-sawed with back-and-forth
penalties, but neither team con-
verted. Michigan had just four
shots on goal, with no real qual-
ity looks.
Freshman defenseman Jacob
Trouba was the one who finally
lit up the sluggish offense that
was still lethargic throughout
the second stanza. With seven
minutes left, the defenseman
found a loose puck at the top of
the circle and rocketed it past
Fighting Irish goalie Steven
Summerhays's glove to knot the
game at one.
If Michigan was asleep
before, Trouba lightingthe lamp
certainly woke the team up. The
Wolverines kept possession of
the puck and had more better
looks in the last five minutes of
that period than they did in the
previous night and first frame
of Saturday combined - sopho-
more forward Phil Di Giuseppe
fired a breakaway backhand
that bounced off both posts and
Summerhays but never crossed
the line.
It was almost unfortunate for

Michigan, then, that the second
period had to end. As they came
out for the third period, the
momentum that the Wolverines
had been carrying seemed lost
as Notre Dame began to swarm
freshman netminder Steve
Racine.
"You like to keep the game
going," Berenson said. "We're
playing well and we've got a
little bit of momentum and we
need to .feed off every little bit
we can.
"It's was a close, hard-fought
game, and you had to battle for
every inch. We did, and they
did, and they finally broke us."
Racine made the big saves he
should have, and for a while,
the defense held true. Instead
of faltering in front of him, both
the blue liners and the forwards
went out of their way to clear
the zone and stop good Fighting
Irish looks on net.
The good fortune could only
hang on for so long, though.
Senior defenseman Lee Mof-
fie mishandled a puck behind
the net, passing along the end

boards right to a Notre Dame
stick, which turned into the go-
ahead goal. Just minutes later
the Fighting Irish scored again
after another defensive mishap
gave Notre Dame a loose puck
in the slot.
That marked the all-too-
familiar third-period collapse
for Michigan, a team so des-
perate that it pulled its goalie
with 3:20 left in the game, only
to lead to an empty-net goal for
the Fighting Irish.
If anything, the weekend
only confused the Wolverines
more.
Whereas in past games it was
either a weak defensive corps
or a lack of offensive produc-
tion, this weekend highlighted
troubles all over the board. And
time is ticking, as Michigan
approaches the midpoint of its
season.
"I just think we're struggling
to find full-team effort," said
senior forward Kevin Lynch.
"Inconsistency is what we're
fighting right now, and you've
got to find it somewhere."

Daily Sports Writer
It took the Michigan women's
basketball team 6:15 to score its
first basket, and in their second
road game this week, the Wolver-
ines were
handed MICHIGAN 40
their first UTAH 59
loss of the
season in a 59-40 defeat at the
hands of Utah (3-0) and its suffo-
cating defense.
From the opening tip, Michi-
gan (2-1) didn't come out with the
same fire it has had during this
young season. By thetime injured
senior guard Jenny Ryan scored
the Wolverines' first points, the
Utes were spotted a15-point lead.
And what started out ugly only
got uglier for Michigan.
In the first half, the Utes start-
ed off hot shooting 9-for-13 from
the field. No matter what defen-

sive looks it sent Utah, nothing
worked. Senior forward Kate
Thompson got into foul trouble
early, and a thin bench behind
her crippled the Wolverines. The
offense didn't help, turning the
ball over eight times and only hit-
ting one three pointer in the -first
half.
"I think they did a great job
defensively of taking us out of
game and getting us frazzled
(right) away," said Michigan
coach Kim Barnes Arico. "We
had never been in a position like
(being down 15-0) before so I
don't think we really knew how
to respond to it. We couldn't get
anything going offensively."
After a media timeout, the
game began looking up for the
Wolverines who were able to cut
their deficit to nine after a layup
by Ryan with 4:10 remaining in
the half. Despite an offensive
spark, however, Michigan was

unable to close out the half letting
Utah hit three straight three-
pointers and end the half with an
18-point lead.
"We felt pretty good when we
cut (the lead) to nine," Barnes-
Arico said. "It didn't mat-
ter, though, because we really
couldn't stop them when we
needed to and we couldn't make
big shots when we needed to."
Unfortunately for the Wol-
verines, nothing got easier in the
second half. The Utes extended
their lead to as large as 24. Led by
junior forward Michelle Plouffe's
20 points and redshirt junior
forward Taryn Wicijowski's
17 points and seven rebounds,
Utah's offense never let up.
Offensively, Michigan never
got going, shooting 36-percent
from the field and only 2-of-10
beyond the arc. The Wolverines
turned the ball over 13 times and
had just eight assists. It didn't

help that Ryan, who hurt her
shoulder in practice this week,
was playing limited minutes.
"Obviously with Jenny Ryan
hurt it hurt us offensively,"
Barnes Arico said. "She's the
heart and soul of our team and
it hurt us not to have her playing
her (normal) minutes."
With Ryanplayingjust23 min-
utes, senior center Rachel Sheffer
stepped in as the lone bright spot
in the game. The only Wolverine
in double digits, Sheffer scored
15 points on 7-of-14 shooting.
But despite matching up well on
offense, the tough matchup of
Wicijowski on defense proved to
be too tall a task.
"I don't think we were able to
stop them at all," Barnes Arico
said. "Both of them did an excel-
lent job and exposed us early on.
We knew they were going to be
the two keys and we didn't do a
greatjob on them."


PENALTY KICKS
From Page 1B
incredibly successful - ended
in heartbreaking fashion.
The Wolverines got on the
board early in the match on
fifth-year senior midfielder
Clare Stachel's penalty kick
in the 16th minute. The senior
midfielder fired the 12-yard shot
into the upper corner of the net
to give Michigan a1-0 lead.
Stachel's goal was her third
in as many games. She scored a
crucial header against Central
Michigan with under a minute
to play to force the Wolverines'
first-round NCAA Tournament
game into overtime. She also
found the back of the net against
No.24 Portland to help the Wol-
verines advance to the Sweet 16.
The one-goal advantage was
similar to an Oct. 21 contest
against the Nittany Lions in

State College, when the Wol-
verines took a lead but allowed
a late goal and tied 1-1 after two
overtimes.
Similarly, Stachel's tally was
not enough to knock off the
perennial powerhouse. The Nit-
tany Lions tied the game in the
42nd minute when midfielder
Maddy Evans buried a header to
pull Penn State even.
"I was disappointed that we
gave up acorner-kick goal," said
Michigan coach Greg Ryan. "It
was a perfect service. It was 1-1
(at halftime), which I thought
was good."
The score would remain
knotted at one through the end
of regulation and both extra
periods, but there was still plen-
ty of excitement at Jeffrey Field.
In the second half, the Nittany
Lions controlled possession and
tested Michigan's back line,
but it held strong. Near the end
of regulation, the Wolverines

began counterattacking and
exploiting holes in Penn State's
defense, but they couldn't capi-
talize on a number of promising
runs.
Then, with less than a min-
ute to play, the Nittany Lions
created a series of fantastic
goal-scoring opportunities. But
Kopmeyer made a diving save to
parry away a short-range effort,
and the ensuing corner kick
was cleared off the goal line.
The final horn sounded, and the
match headed to extra time.
In the second extra period,
Penn State's Mallory Weber had
a one-on-one chance to end the
game with a golden goal, but
Kopmeyer charged the mid-
fielder and saved alow shot with
her leg.
"(Kopmeyer) made two or
three big-time saves," Ryan said.
The game then proceeded to
the shootout, where Kopmeyer
blocked the first two attempts

GARDNER
From Page 1B
field, Gardner simply shined. His
career day at quarterback paced
Michigan in its 4,2-17 win, lead-
ing the Wolverine offense with
such efficiency that Iowa was
powerless to try and match it.
Numbers sometimes lie,
but not in this case - Gardner
completed 18 of his 23 passing
attempts for 314 yards and three
touchdowns. He ran for 37 yards
and three more touchdowns,
bringing his total to six touch-,
downs.
His lone mistakes were an
interception and a fumble (which
Michigan recovered, but which
forced the team to punt). Both
miscues occurred in the fourth
quarter, when the outcome had
already been decided.
"He's doing great," said Rob-
inson, who has topped out at five
total touchdowns in one game
over his 34 starts at quarterback.
"He's been playing well, and we
all had faith in him and we all
knew he could do it. I'm behind
him 100 percent.
"He's doing a great job and I
can't wait to see what he can do
in the future."
But the future has become
now, in the wake of Robinson's
injury. Michigan coach Brady
Hoke said that though the regu-

lar starting quarterback can
throw the ball, he can't do so
with the effectiveness necessary
to play at his normal position -
hence his role on Saturday, when
he spent most of the day lined
up as a running back, either tak-
ing handoffs or catching short
screens.
When Robinson did line up
at quarterback against Iowa, it
was to run the ball - only on a
few occasions did he pose the
threat to pass, and it turned out
to be mere show to deke the
Hawkeyes. The passing was left
to Gardner, as it has been for the
last two weeks, with Robinson
relegated to the sidelines. He was
able to take advantage against a
subpar Iowa defense.
Gardner found holes in the
secondary with ease, allow-
ing him to find open receivers
downfield and accurately at that.
Among his better throws were a
37-yard touchdown pass to fifth-
year senior wide receiver Roy
Roundtree and a 51-yard strike
to redshirt junior receiver Jer-
emy Gallon, which set up a later
touchdown.
And as Gardner also displayed
in his first two starts, he was
able to keep plays alive against
the Hawkeyes when no options
presented themselves initially -
the junior scrambled for several
first downs, and at other times
he found open receivers after he

extended the plays.
Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz said
bluntlythathis team "didn'thave
any answers" for the Gardner-
led Michigan offense, which
scored its six touchdowns on its
first six drives of the game. Hoke,
often reluctant to heap praiseon
his players, said that Gardner's
performance was "pretty good."
"A lot," Roundtree said when
asked about Gardner's improve-
ment since his first start against
Minnesota. "He's really calm in
the huddle.... I feel like he's really
stayed humble and led this team,
and is so confident in what he can
do."
Undoubtedly, part of Gard-
ner's success can be attributed to
the regained threat of Robinson,
who was effective in his new role
as all-purpose player.
Hoke said he and the offen-
sive coaches have been thinking
about ways to play both explosive
athletes at the same time for "18
months," which dates to his ini-
tial months on the Michigan job.
The Wolverines had placed both
players on the field at times last
season in what was termed the
"deuce" package, and Hoke said
that type of utilization is what
he imagined when contemplat-
ing how Gardner and Robinson
would be deployed together.
But Robinson's injury changed
that dynamic, leading to a flip
flop of roles in a way, with Gard-

on net. But her heroics weren't
enough and the Nittany Lions
stormed back to take the vic-
tory.
Thanks to the seniors, Kop-
meyer, Stachel and midfielder
Emily Jaffe, the Michigan pro-
gram looks to have a bright
future. As freshmen, Stachel
and Kopmeyer suffered through
a four-win season. This year,
the seniors led the Wolverines
to 16 wins as they helped galva-
nize the best defense in the pro-
gram's history.
In the process, Jaffe scored a
game-winning header to defeat
Michigan State, Kopmeyer set
the Wolverine record for saves
and Stachel tied the school's
mark for most goals scored by
a player in a single NCAA Tour-
nament. While the scoreboard
at Jeffery Field flashed the
final result - 1-1 - the seniors
walked off the pitch with their
heads held high.
ner the primary quarterback and
Robinson the secondary thereat.
Gardner said he never imag-
ined having as much success at
quarterback as he's had in his
three games as starter, in which
he's totaled 834 passing yards,
13 total touchdowns and, most
importantly for Michigan, three
wins.
"I never thought that, because
if Denard hadn't got hurt, I'd still
be playing receiver and we'd be
winning games in a different
way," Gardner said. "Just thank-
ful that I've taken advantage of
the opportunity."
It seems like that opportunity
will remain for Gardner for the
rest of the season, or at least for
next week's game against Ohio
State. Hoke didn't give a firm
answer, but in saying Robinson
"could" return to full-tite quar-
terback, it appears that Gardner
will keep the reins of Michigan's
offense for now.
Though redshirt junior run-
ning back Fitzgerald Toussaint
was lost to injury, Robinson is
back from his and the offense is
trending firmly upward, mostly
thanks to the revelation that has
been Gardner's passing.
The present and future quar-
terback spoke for all Wolverine
fans when asked to evaluate his
performance on Saturday.
"I'm happy about it," Gardner
said.

the win was clouded by an appar-
ent left leg injury to redshirtjunior
running back Fitzgerald Toussaint.
Toussaintwas tackled frombehind
on a run, and his left shin appeared
to buckle outward. Toussaint was
carted off the field and was later
hospitalized, where he will under-
go surgery. Gardner - who joined
Robinson and redshirt junior
offensive tackle Taylor Lewan in
comforting Toussaint before he
was carted off the field - called the
injury "heartbreaking."
Toussaint's carries were divided
between Robinson and sopho-
more Thomas Rawls. Offensive
coordinator Al Borges frequently
employed a full-house forma-
tion, with Rawls as the deep back
flanked by Robinson and senior
Vincent Smith. Out of that set,
Michigan called traditional rushes,
throws and exotic looks like hand-
off options. Hoke said Borges had
designed 15 plays specifically for
Robinson as a running back.
Two of Michigan's touchdowns
were set up by that full house set
with Robinson on the field. Michi-
gan had scored once in the first
quarter - on a Gardner boot-leg
- and once at the beginning of the
second quarter on a 37-yard touch-
down pass to fifth-year senior
receiver Roy Roundtree. On the
next drive, Gardner faked a hand-
off to Robinson out of the full-.
house formation,thenpitchedback
to Rawls, who rushed to Iowa's
two-yard line. Gardner later scored
on another boot-leg to put Michi-
gan ahead 21-10.
On the following drive, Gard-
ner again faked to Robinson and
rolled right, then threw a screen
across the field to Smith, who could
have walked into the end zone. The
score put Michigan ahead 28-10 at
halftime.
Gardner said he knew the full
house was difficult to stop because
the Michigan defense struggled in
practice - and they knew what to
expect. This week, Gardner ran
the slip screen inpractice. Before
the play, Gardner said, sophomore
defensive end Frank Clark yelled,
"You know what's coming!"
"No you don't," Gardner said.
"You have no idea. You think you
do, but you don't. And then we
threw it right over their head, and
it happened the exact same way in
the game today, and we scored a
touchdown."
Fifth-year senior safety Jordan
Kovacs can relate.
"When we go against our
offense in practice, we just get
played," Kovacs said. "We just
shake our head like,'I don't know.'I
don't know whatI would do. Ihave
no idea."
Iowa had few answers for the
three-back look but had even fewer
for Michigan's air attack. Twice,
Gardner found receivers with no
defenders in the area for easy long
scores. One the first, the 37-yard
touchdown pass to Roundtree,
Gardner also could have thrown
to a wide-open Drew Dileo in the
middle of the field.
To open the second half, Gard-
ner scored again, on - you guessed
it - a boot-leg. On the next drive,
freshman tight end Devin Funch-
ess was uncovered down the field
for another easy 29-yard touch-
downreception.
The score was Michigan's 28th
unanswered point, and the Wol-

verines had scored on every single
possession through three quarters.
Only a Gardner interception at the
start of the final frame ended the
streak.
Throughout the game, Borges
peppered in Robinson runs. In the
first quarter, Robinson scampered
for 40 yards, freezing, then beat-
ing one defender, before he ducked
out of bounds. Near the end of the
third quarter, Robinson caught a
pass down the sideline, reversed
field completely and dashed down
the opposite sideline for a gain of
20 yards.
After a shaky quarter and a half,
the Michigan defense shut down
Iowa for much of the rest of the
game. By the fourth quarter, the
win was assured, though Hoke still
called the defensive performance
"awful."
But the effort was more than
enough for a happy, if not tradi-
tional, exit for -Robinson, Kovacs
and the rest of the seniors. The two
walked off the field together, smil-
ing and "reflecting on our journey,"
Kovacs said.
Then Robinson - Michigan's
quarterback and redeemer and,
now, running back - turned to
his fellow captain and said, "This
is crazy man. I can't believe it's
alreadyhere."

ROUNDTREE
From Page 1B
ing as senior quarterback
Denard Robinson's favorite tar-
get. He made 16 catches for 266
yards and four touchdowns in
eight games.
He took catches away from
Roundtree, who had just 13
catches for 175 yards, and red-
shirt junior slot receiver Jeremy
Gallon. Gallon had three more
catches than Gardner, but it
was Gardner, the receiver trans-
plant, who had emerged as the
true deep threat.
When Robinson went down
with an ulnar-nerve injury three
weeks ago, the roles reversed.
The receivers took over again,
as Gardner transitioned back to
quarterback..
After his first career start at
Minnesota on Nov. 3, Gardner
explained that moonlighting at
receiver had aided his develop-
ment at quarterback because he
knew the tendencies of receiv-

ers, what they liked, what they
didn't.
In consecutive victories over
Minnesota, Northwestern and
Iowa, he helped. them. They
helped him right back.
Roundtree and Gallon both
made highlight-reel catches in
a last-minute comeback against
the Wildcats a week ago, and
Michigan's receiving num-
bers have sky-rocketed. In the
last three games, Gardner has
passed for 234, 286 and 314
yards - three of Michigan's top
four passing totals of the season
- and seven touchdowns.
And Roundtree and Gallon
have been the main benefactors
in the air game, combining 485
yards and two touchdowns on
28 catches. Against Iowa, both
made five catches, with Gallon
going for a game-high 133 yards
and Roundtree for 83.
They were, at long last, the
favorite targets once again.
Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz,
whose secondary was gashed
again and again in the passing

game, came away impressed
with the receiving corps.
"They've got very good
skilled players," Ferentz said.
"They have had that traditional-
ly, and it looks to me like they've
got it again. We didn't do a great
job keeping up with those guys
when we were in the right cov-
erage, then we dropped a couple
coverages too, which made it
really easy for him. Gardner did
a good job finding them."
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
praised Gallon's concentra-
tion, Roundtree's corrections.
Roundtree, who has been criti-
cized for catching the ball with
his body instead of out front
with his hands, credited receiv-
ers coach Jeff Hecklinski's
training.
"Back in the spring is when
Coach Heck had us (using) ten-
nis balls and had all the wide
receivers working on eye coor-
dination," Roundtree said. "It's
just something I really worked
on this year, just using my hands
away from my body. (It) really

helps if the defender's on your
back."
Hoke said one of the fin-
est catches of the afternoon
was an out-route to Roundtree
along the sideline. Gallon led
the downfield, vertical passing
game with catches of 51, 31 and
31 yards.
"Roy made big plays, Gallon
made big plays," Gardner said.
Roundtree kept his response
short. He was just having fun.
"It's always fun catching
balls, being a receiver," he said.
When the clock came to a stop
on Michigan's decisive 42-17
victory over the Hawkeyes,
Roundtree took his time leaving
the turf He shook hands, sang
"The Victors" and slowly moved
toward the tunnel.
Finally, he jogged toward
the tunnel, grinning and high,
fiving kids on both sides of the
entrance. He disappeared into
the tunnel for the final time in
his career, finishing just the way
he dreamt. Just the way he visu-
alized.

4/ Denard, Gardner and touchdowns, oh my. Robin-
son was dynamic, Gardner was exceptional and the
Michigan offense just changed drastically in the
Denards penultimate week of the regular season.

Even without the injured Toussaint, Michigan
gained 199 yards on the ground. On defense, the
Wolverines struggled early, but mostly through the
air. A solid performance in the trenches.

This is our last chance to act like grumps about the
student section so here it is: it was half-filled for the
Senior Day ceremonies, and didn't fill up complete-
ly for the game. Good job, good effort this year.


I OOKING GOOD

JUNIOR QUARTERBACK
DEVIN GARDNER: Everyone
laughed last year when
Robinson said Gardner
could be the Big Ten's best
player, if only he played.
Some balked earlier this
season when Gardner said
he still considered himself
a quarterback. But his
progression has been faster
than anyone could have
expected. On Saturday,
he turned in Michigan's
best performance from
a thrower all year. He
was i8-for-23 passing for
314 yards, with just two
mistakes - a meaningless
interception in the fourth
quarter and a fumble, which
was recovered by Michigan.
Plus, he scored six
touchdowns total. "Pretty
good," as Michigan coach
Brady Hoke described it.

REDSHIRT JUNIOR RUNNING
BACK FITZGERALD
TOUSSAINT: Toussaint
appeared to suffer a serious
injury to his left leg in the
first quarter of Saturday's
game. Toussaint was tackled
from behind, and his left
foot got caught underneath
him, causing his shin to
buckle outward. Toussaint'
was carted off the field and
transported to the hospital
where he was expected to
undergo surgery. After the
game, Gardner called the
injury "heartbreaking,"
and Robinson spoke of
Toussaint's toughness,
saying that he is confident
Toussaint will recover.
Hoke said that Toussaint
was accompanied by two
brothers at the hospital,
but did not give more
information on Saturday.

I

1. NOTRE DAME (13): Just
USC stands in the way of
the Irish and the National
Championship game.
Wow.
2. ALABAMA (3): Welcomee
back, Bama. We've missed
you. Looks like another
year with a SEC champion.
Sigh.
3. GEORGIA: Somehow,
the Bulldogs have played 4
just two top-25 teams.
4. OREGON: The Ducks
quacked out due to a
missed field goal.M
5. FLORIDA: Would the
Gators sneak into the
National Championship
game without winning the
SEC East?

6. OHIO STATE: Can the
ineligible Buckeyes still
win an AP title? There's
one clean answer left: The
Game.
7. KANSAS STATE: Heavy
lies the crown. The
Wildcats collapsed in their
first week with the No.1
ranking.
8. FLORIDA STATE: The
ACC might be worse than
the Big Ten this year.
9. TEXAS A&M: We humbly
request to switch lives with
Johnny Football.
10. SOUTH CAROLINA:
The Cocks have kept it up
all season. Now it's time
to finish it off with a big
splash.
