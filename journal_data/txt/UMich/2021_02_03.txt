On Jan. 27, the Washtenaw 

County Health Department issued 
a two week long stay-in-place 
recommendation urging University 
of Michigan students living on or 
near the Ann Arbor campus to stay 
in their residences and avoid group 
contact. 
The 
recommendation 

came after numerous cases of the 
more contagious B.1.1.7 variant 
were discovered among University 
students, 
prompting 
Michigan 

Athletics to cease all activity for 
two weeks. 

The Daily spoke with students 

about their thoughts on the recent 
recommendation and whether they 
believed it would successfully curb 
the spread of the virus. 

Is it a recommendation or an 

order?

The guidelines of the current 

stay-in-place 
recommendation 

for all undergraduate, graduate 
and professional students are very 
similar to the stay-at-home order 
directed solely at undergraduate 
students in October 2020. Other 
than the expanded range, the most 
notable difference is that the county 
refers to the current guidelines 
as recommendations rather than 
orders, so there are no enforcement 
mechanisms.

The difference between an 

“order” and a “recommendation” 
has caused some students to 
question what the change will 
achieve. 
LSA 
junior 
Alyssa 

Frizzo said very few of the new 
recommendations 
are 
actually 

enforced.

“I mean, the only truly enforced 

thing is that gyms are closed,” 
Frizzo said. “Nothing else is 
actually, definitively changed.”

When asked about the difference 

between the fall’s order and 
the 
current 
recommendation, 

University 
spokesperson 
Rick 

Fitzgerald 
said 
the 
county 

health 
department 
has 
had 

time to understand what other 
health departments and campus 
communities have done over the 
course of the pandemic.

“I 
think 
the 
advice, 

collectively, is to handle these as 
recommendations, not as local 
health orders,” Fitzgerald said.

LSA 
freshman 
Alexander 

Manthous said while the order in 
the fall semester helped reduce 
cases among students, several 
students got away with violating 
those 
guidelines. 
According 

to 
Manthous, 
evading 
these 

recommendations will be even 
easier this semester. 

“I know cases did go down last 

semester when they put that order 
in place, but it just seems like the 
University hasn’t been good at 
enforcing these rules,” Manthous 
said.

Susan Ringler-Cerniglia, public 

information officer for WCHD, 
said the measure is proactive and 
focuses on urging compliance.

“The 
recommendation 
is 
a 

recommendation, and we’re hoping 
for good compliance, but there’s not 
necessarily the same enforcement 
mechanism that there is with an 
order,” Ringler-Cerniglia said. 

Engineering 
freshman 
Sam 

Sugarman 
said 
the 
issue 
of 

compliance 
has 
plagued 
the 

University community throughout 
the pandemic.

“To some extent, people just 

aren’t 
going 
to 
follow 
these 

guidelines,” Sugarman said. “I feel 
like people are following what they 
deem is safe, not what the county 
deems is safe. Kids are kids. They’re 
gonna do what they want. I think 
(the recommendation) is pretty 
ineffective, to be honest.”

Peter 
Chen, 
professor 
of 

computer science and engineering 
at the University of Michigan, was 
placed on administrative leave 
Wednesday 
following 
pending 

criminal charges for sexual conduct 
of the first degree with a victim 
under the age of 13. The offense is 
alleged to have occurred on April 
1, 2017, and Chen is scheduled for a 
probable cause conference hearing 
on Feb. 4. 

There is no information at this 

time that links Chen’s charges to 
his career at the University, an 
email to CSE students from Alec 
Gallimore, dean of the College of 
Engineering, said.

“Let me be clear — sexual 

misconduct 
is 
completely 

unacceptable 
in 
any 
form,” 

Gallimore wrote. “I encourage 
anyone who has any information 
about misconduct to report it. It is 
only when we are aware of issues 
that we can address them.”

Gallimore also wrote in the 

email he plans to work with CSE 
Chair Michael Wellman and the 
rest of the department to address 
its climate and culture. When 
asked how the CSE department 
will be handling this situation, 
University 
spokesperson 
Rick 

Fitzgerald wrote in an email to 
The Michigan Daily there was no 
further information to share.

In an email to The Michigan 

Daily, Mariell Lehman, Chen’s 
lawyer, said Chen denies the 
charges against him.

“On January 26, 2021 Mr. Chen 

was made aware of the criminal 
sexual conduct allegations that had 
been made against him,” Lehman 
wrote. “He completely denies the 
allegations and has cooperated 
fully with the Ann Arbor Police 
Department to assist them in their 
investigation. Mr. Chen is confident 
that the truth will prevail and that 
he will be exonerated fully. Mr. 
Chen thanks the numerous people 
who have reached out in support of 
him over the last few days.”

In a statement to The Daily 

Wednesday 
evening, 
the 

Engineering Student Government 

wrote their assembly would be 
meeting with Gallimore to discuss 
the situation further.

“We hope to use this time 

to get a better understanding 
of the details surrounding this 
event,” the statement reads. “We 
patently abhor any and all sexual 
misconduct. Additionally, we 
will be publishing resources for 
students on our website promptly.”

Engineering 
sophomore 

Zaynab 
Elkolaly, 
an 
assembly 

representative in Central Student 
Government 
and 
Engineering 

Student 
Government, 
attended 

a pre-scheduled meeting with 
Gallimore on Thursday evening. 
She said Gallimore encouraged 
those at the meeting to not jump 
to conclusions before Chen has 
been proven guilty and expressed 
concern for the wellbeing of 
students. 

“I could also tell that he was 

personally 
very 
enraged 
and 

worried for us,” Elkolaly said. “It 
just seems like he’s a guy that cares, 
but his hands are tied right now.”

University 
alum 
Siddhant 

Pagariya was enrolled in EECS 482 

during his time at the University. 
He said he believes that students 
deserve more than just a follow 
up email on the issue because 
misconduct is a continuing issue in 
the computer science department.

“I guess for students’ peace 

of mind, they should allow for a 
lot more of a conversation, and 
listening to both sides would be 
much better than just, ‘Hey, here’s 
an email,’” Pagariya said. “They 
should … have more transparency. 
Obviously this is still a developing 
story, but even having counselors 
or some sort of conversation would 
be really helpful.”

Chen, who has taught at the 

University since 1993, was a 
professor for EECS 482 and EECS 
498 this semester. He was the last 
person you would expect to do 
this, University alum Chris Combs 
said.

“It’s a very horrible situation 

where someone who, on the one 
hand, so many students looked up 
to and respected, may have done 
something truly evil,” Combs said. 

With toddlers swaddled warmly 

in strollers, babies on parents’ 
shoulders and homemade signs in 
hand, over 100 parents, community 
members and Ann Arbor Public 
School 
students 
gathered 

downtown 
Saturday 
afternoon 

chanting “lead with facts, not with 
fear” in protest against AAPS’ 
decision to offer remote-only 
instruction indefinitely during the 
pandemic.

Ann Arbor Reasonable Return 

(A2R2) — an advocacy group 
seeking a reasonable approach to 
reopening schools — protested 
in front of the Ann Arbor Post 
Office on E. Liberty St. to demand 
in-person options for AAPS. More 
than 600 community members 
have signed a petition for in-person 
options, and nearly 130 physicians 
and pediatric providers signed a 
letter supporting A2R2’s goals.

Since Gov. Gretchen Whitmer 

shut down all K-12 schools in 
Michigan at the start of the 
pandemic, 
the 
district 
has 

implemented a virtual learning 

plan called Reimagine Learning 
to help students succeed during 
the pandemic. In early January, 
Whitmer announced that the state 
was recommending that all K-12 
schools offer in-person learning 
options by March 1.

Last week, the Centers for 

Disease Control and Prevention 
released 
updated 
guidelines 

saying schools can safely reopen 
with masks and social distancing 
requirements, 
citing 
evidence 

that shows schools are not a huge 
driver of community transmission.

Hundreds have alleged that the late doctor sexually abused them from 1968 to 2003

Since the late University of 

Michigan athletic doctor Robert 
Anderson was named in numerous 
allegations of sexual abuse dating 
back to the 1970s, more than 70 
lawsuits have been filed in federal 
court. Hundreds of former students 
allege Anderson sexually abused 
them while he was employed by the 
University from 1968 to 2003. 

Among these suits is a class 

action complaint which, unlike 
the individual lawsuits against the 
University representing specific 
plaintiffs, seeks to prosecute the 
University on behalf of all students 
affected by Anderson. 

The lawyers bringing the class 

action suit and those representing 
the 
University 
have 
been 
in 

mediation since mid-October. A 
settlement between the parties 
would offer monetary damages to 
the hundreds of former students 
Anderson allegedly abused. By 
including reform measures in their 
negotiations, it would also result in 
changes to the University’s sexual 
misconduct policy, which applies to 
all students, faculty and staff on the 
University’s three campuses.

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily last September, 
Annika Martin, the interim class 
counsel for the class action suit, 
said the lawsuit is unique because it 
aims for institutional reform as well 

as collecting monetary damages for 
survivors. Martin has worked on 
previous class actions, including a 
now-settled case against George 
Tyndall, 
a 
former 
University 

of Southern California campus 
gynecologist, who sexually abused 
thousands of former patients.

“Class actions can ask for 

change, not just money,” Martin 
said. “So that was one thing that 
was really important because when 
you have these institutions like 
USC, like U of M, like churches, 
like youth organizations, sports 
organizations, the institution needs 
to make changes to make sure that 
these kinds of things can never 
happen again.”

When contacted by The Daily, 

University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald declined to comment on 
active litigation. 

In October 2020, Fitzgerald told 

The Detroit News that “substantial 
changes” have been made to the 
University’s 
sexual 
misconduct 

policies and procedures over the 
past few years. The interim sexual 
misconduct policy, which took 
effect in August 2020, received 
a mix of support and criticism 
from 
the 
campus 
community 

for including cross-examination 
between the accuser and accused 
in cases of sexual misconduct. 

Fitzgerald also told The Detroit 

News the University is continuing 
to review the recommendations 
from 
WilmerHale, 
the 
law 

firm hired by the University to 

investigate 
decades 
of 
sexual 

misconduct from former Provost 
Martin Philbert, as they consider 
further changes. In July, the 
WilmerHale 
report 
found 

Philbert 
committed 
numerous 

acts of sexual misconduct over 
the course of two decades at the 
University. The University has 
hired WilmerHale to investigate 
Anderson’s alleged behavior as 
well.

Given a string of additional 

allegations 
against 
faculty 
in 

recent years — including against 
two professors in the School 
of Music, Theatre & Dance, an 
English professor in LSA and, 
more recently, two professors 
in the College of Engineering — 
some student organizers argue 
the University’s policy changes 
are insufficient and hope the 
Anderson case will compel more 
robust change.

Business freshman Aditi Jain, 

co-president of the on-campus 
survivor advocacy group Roe v. 
Rape, said the University’s choice 
to appoint professor Jason Mars’ 
to teach a required computer 
science 
course 
this 
semester 

despite 
allegations 
of 
sexual 

misconduct can be compared to 
the University’s alleged failure 
to respond to warnings about 
Anderson in the years he was 
employed.

‘Perfect Pair’ matches students with assisted 
living residents to combat pandemic loneliness

Having 
volunteered 
in 

assisted 
living 
facilities 

for more than three years, 
University of Michigan alum 
Emily Lerner said she noticed 
it was a challenge for senior 
residents to connect with their 
passions and the world beyond 
their facility. 

“Well before COVID, a lot 
of families stopped coming 

to visit,” Lerner said in an 
interview with The Michigan 
Daily. “And, on top of that, 
activities-wise, it’s a lot of 
bingo and ice cream socials. As 
fun as that can be, not every 
single person becomes 85 and 
wants to do bingo over and 
over. A lot of the residents were 
just getting a little bit antsy 
and feeling like they had lost 
any sort of connection to the 
outside world.”

Throughout 
her 
college 

career, Lerner thought about 
whether she could do anything 
to 
solve 
this 
engagement 

problem 
in 
assisted 
living 

facilities. 
After 
graduating 

last spring into a pandemic 
and economic recession, she 
said she found there was an 
increasingly urgent need for a 
solution, and she had the time 
to act.

In 
August 
2020, 
Lerner 

founded 
Perfect 
Pair, 
an 

organization 
that 
brings 

University 
students 
and 

assisted 
living 
residents 

together amid a pandemic that 
has largely isolated seniors.

In the few months since 

its 
creation, 
Perfect 
Pair 

has recruited more than 100 
students, partnered with five 

assisted living facilities across 
southeast Michigan and formed 
five 
internal 
committees 

to work on issues such as 
fundraising and programming.

Lerner, as the organization’s 

executive director, is working 
to further grow Perfect Pair 
and prepare it for a post-
pandemic world. She said she is 
hoping to form a chapter of the 
organization at Michigan State 
University in the next year and 
a half, and she has applied for 
501(c)(3) status so Perfect Pair 
can operate as a tax-exempt 
nonprofit.

When 
the 
pandemic 

subsides, students will carpool 
to senior facilities for activities, 
which Lerner hopes will help 
engage residents who aren’t as 
technologically savvy or just 
prefer in-person interaction.

LSA 
sophomore 
Melanie 

Esterine, 
a 
Perfect 
Pair 

member, said she joined the 
organization last fall so she 

could build a strong connection 
with her pair, especially during 
the pandemic. 

“I just thought it was so 

beautiful that this club was 
focusing on still getting them 
that human interaction, even if 
it is virtual,” Esterine said.

Perfect Pair tailors matches 

between students and residents 
by 
conducting 
preliminary 

questionnaires 
about 
their 

interests. Esterine said her 
match, Enid, used to be an 
English 
professor 
at 
the 

University, and the two bonded 
over their interests in reading, 
art and their hometown of New 
York City. 

“I already had a copy of ‘The 

Great Gatsby,’ and I had told 
(Enid) in our first meeting 
just as an introduction that 
that’s what I was reading at the 
moment,” Esterine said. “And 
she was like, ‘That’d be so great 
if we could read it together.’ So 
then Perfect Pair also provided 
her with the copy, and then we 
read it together. And when we 
finished it, we came back and 
discussed.”

In 
addition 
to 
fulfilling 

individualized 
requests 
for 

supplies, Perfect Pair sends 
activity boxes to all students 
and residents so they can 
engage 
in 
activities 
like 

painting, planting and letter-
writing over Zoom. 

Norma Aunins, a resident at 

Brecon 
Village 
Independent 

Living, said she decided to 
join Perfect Pair because she 
previously had talked with 
students 
on 
Facebook 
and 

wanted to try something new.

“It was a way to continue 

having contact with the outside 
world because it gets kind of 
closed in around here during 

this pandemic,” Aunins said. 
“I feel like I’m contributing to 
something.”

Aunins 
said 
her 
match, 

Alexandria, shares interests 
in medicine and animals, and 
their chats help her keep up 
with younger generations.

“I enjoy her personality,” 

Aunins said. “We seem to have 
a similar sense of humor and 
a lot of interests. This past 
week, she put on the screen 
a crossword puzzle, and we 
worked together. She being 
young got some answers that 
I never would have come up 
with, and me being the old lady 
of the crew … came up with a 
lot of other ones. So we really 
enjoyed that.”

Aunins 
highlighted 
that 

residents and students alike 
benefit from the interactions.

“I would highly recommend 

it to anyone who has any 
interest,” Aunins said. “It gives 
you contact with the outside 
world, 
it 
gives 
(students) 

something to do, where they’re 
contributing, 
and 
you 
also 

are contributing to their life 
experiences. So the interaction 
is great.”

Even though participating 

in the program isn’t a big-time 
commitment, Esterine said it 
has made a positive impact on 
her life.

“I feel like it’s added, as 

cheesy as this sounds, a friend 
or family member, just because 
Enid is so, so sweet,” Esterine 
said. 
“I 
genuinely 
enjoy 

speaking to her, I’ve learned so 
much from her and I’m just so 
inspired by her.”

CAMPUS LIFE

Organization started by University alum aims to facilitate interaction during COVID-19

“I just thought it 
was so beautiful 

that this club 

was focusing on 
still getting them 

that human 

interaction, even 

if it is virtual” 

TESS CROWLEY/Daily

Snow on the ground, but no students in sight on the Diag due to the stay in place recommendation last week.


It was just after 3 p.m. on Friday, 

Jan. 29 when Cameron Allen, a 
senior at Laingsburg High School 
in Laingsburg, Mich., received the 
email he was waiting for. As Allen’s 
parents hovered over his shoulder, 
he clicked on his computer mouse 
and instantly jumped out of his seat 
in excitement.

“I got in,” he shouted, looking 

directly at the camera he positioned 
to record his and his family’s 
reaction on TikTok, a popular 
video-sharing app that rose to 
prominence this past year.

His parents’ faces morphed 

from anxious to a mix of relief 
and excitement as they saw the 
confetti appear on screen, signaling 
an acceptance to the University 
of Michigan. Allen hugged his 
parents as “Latch” by Disclosure 
and Sam Smith, a popular song 
among TikTok creators, played in 
the background.

“I started recording because 

my school is super rural and most 
of the colleges I applied to nobody 
else did,” Allen said in an interview 
with The Michigan Daily. “I’m 
doing this to show my classmates 
they can achieve the impossible 
… somebody from a small town in 
Michigan can get into these high-
achieving schools.”

Allen’s 
40-second 
TikTok 

followed the script of a typical 
college admission reaction video: 
family huddling around a nervous 
applicant, 
looks 
of 
anxiety 

washing away to excitement or 
disappointment when the decision 
appears on screen. As TikTok 
continues to climb in popularity, 
particularly with Generation Z 
users, it has become a go-to platform 
for sharing these moments.

When the University’s early 

action admissions decisions came 
out Friday afternoon, hundreds 
of high school seniors vying for a 
spot in the class of 2025 turned to 
TikTok to share their results. For 

creators such as Julia Heilman, a 
senior at Clarkston High School in 
Clarkston, Mich., it was like a chain 
reaction: she saw reactions from 
other applicants on the platform 
and wanted to add hers to the 
growing pool.

“I thought I’d film my reaction 

because I didn’t have anyone home 
at the time and wanted to open it 
right away,” Heilman said. “Then, I 
saw other people make videos and 
thought, ‘This makes me happy, I 
might as well share it.’”

An atypical application cycle
College applicants around the 

world are turning to TikTok to 
share updates throughout this 
application cycle. Some users have 
“dueted” old videos about the 
admissions process — meaning 
they put an older video next to 
a newer video within one frame 
— as they heard back from each 
school they applied to. This trend 
of posting decision reactions on 
TikTok became popular when 
Tulane University began releasing 
early decision and early action 
results in November, though this 
type of video has been made since 
the early days of YouTube.

Admissions offices at schools 

like the University of Florida 
and Louisiana State University 
started using the platform this 
year to reach the next generation 
of applicants. Whether on TikTok 
or not, admissions offices across 
the country have spent the last 
year creating virtual replacements 
for the campus tours and college 
fairs lost to the ongoing pandemic 
in hopes of connecting with 
prospective students.

Following the lead of other 

colleges across the country, the 
University of Michigan instituted 
a test-flexible application policy 
in response to canceled and 
postponed SAT and ACT testing 
dates due to the pandemic. The 
early action deadline was pushed 
two weeks later than normal this 
year, meaning decisions did not 
come out until a month later than 

they did in prior cycles.

With a public health-adjusted 

school year and campus tours 
now virtual or self-guided, it 
has become more difficult for 
prospective students to understand 
the Michigan experience beyond 
what is available online or on social 
media.

But TikTok and other social 

media platforms allow admitted 
students to find other admittees 
and get a better understanding of 
the school without physically being 
there, according to Olivia Phillips, 
a senior at Princeton Day School 
in Princeton, New Jersey who was 
accepted to the University Friday. 

The 
#umich2025 
hashtag, 

which Phillips and other creators 
used 
when 
posting 
decision 

reactions, has accumulated more 
than 300,000 views on TikTok. 
In addition to amassing more 
than 20,000 views, Phillips’ video 
received comments from other 
accepted students, allowing her to 
virtually meet potential peers.

“I’ve already created my own 

little 
community 
within 
less 

than 24 hours just from social 
media, which has been absolutely 
incredible,” Phillips said. “Even 
though 
we 
can’t 
have 
those 

in-person experiences, it’s not 
completely lost because we’ve been 
able to remedy that with other 
methods.”

College acceptances caught on 

camera

When some applicants got the 

email notifying them that their 
early action results were available 
on Friday afternoon, they waited 
to open them until they could set 
up their camera and record the 
outcome. Others said they held 
off on making videos until after 
knowing they were accepted to 
avoid being on camera if they 
received bad news.

Some admittees took to TikTok 

to tell the world that their dreams 
came true, but for those who 
received a result they weren’t 
hoping for, it was to tell of a 

dream deferred. The University’s 
freshman class acceptance rate 
typically falls around 25%, making 
gaining acceptance competitive 
and deferrals common in the early 
action round. In a video announcing 
he got deferred, one applicant 
asked, “Did anyone actually get in?”

For those who were accepted, 

they 
wanted 
to 
share 
their 

acceptances 
with 
classmates, 

but that was difficult to do with 
many still learning from home. 
According to Jeanie Chang, a 
senior at Northwest High School 
in Germantown, Md. who made a 
video after being accepted to LSA, 
TikTok is one solution to this issue 
because it allows seniors to share 
their results with peers around the 
world.

Chang said posting admissions 

decisions to TikTok is less taboo 
than on other apps like Instagram 
because the algorithm of videos 
makes the platform feel less formal 
and tied to one’s personal image. In 
her experience, TikTok has become 

a virtual community where seniors 
can come together to celebrate 
one another’s victories or provide 
support to those who got undesired 
results.

 “This is one way of coping 

with losing out on senior year, and 
it’s fun to celebrate with others,” 
Chang said. “Even though I got 
rejected from other schools, I’m 
living vicariously through other 
people. It’s just fun to hype people 
up.”

A genre of its own

Though TikTok has risen in 

popularity as a hub for sharing 
the highs and lows of the college 
admissions process, the app hasn’t 
dethroned other platforms used 
to share college-related intel. 
College Confidential, a messaging 
forum used by applicants and 
their families to speculate about 
admissions across the world, lit 
up like it has in previous years as 
applicants began posting their 
results to the University-focused 
page.

YouTube 
is 
also 
still 
a 

destination for these videos as 
well as longer, vlog-style posts 
about the admissions process. 
Chang, who is waiting for all of 
her admissions decisions before 
making a final decision on where 
to attend, is recording her reaction 
to the decision of every school she 
applied to so she can eventually 
make a YouTube video about her 
college selection experience.De

College acceptance videos have 

become somewhat of their own 
genre, specifically on YouTube, 
and 
TikTok 
offers 
another 

avenue for sharing these short, 
high-energy videos with a wide 
audience. 
Because 
TikTok’s 

algorithm system displays videos 
from users beyond just those 
who someone follows — on a feed 
known as the “For You Page” 
— admittees’ reactions spread 
widely.

Student-run site ‘Study Buddies’ helps 
classmates connect during virtual semester

As 
Engineering 

sophomores 
Sam 
Forman 

and Varun Jindal prepared 
to return to virtual classes 
last semester, they said they 
dreaded the thought of being 
physically 
isolated 
from 

their future classmates. As 
a result, the two came up 
with an idea to help with 
common problems students 
experience 
during 
online 

learning.

“We thought of this site — 

it was pretty simple, right?” 
Forman said. “All we had 

to do was match students 
in virtual classes, and we 
created the site in about 
a week and posted on our 
(class) Facebook group chat. 
It blew up more than we were 
expecting.” 

The 
site 
is 
called 

StudyBuddies — a platform 
where students fill out a 
short 
form 
about 
which 

classes they are taking and 
their personal study habits. 
An 
algorithm 
matches 

students in the same class 
into 
small 
study 
groups. 

According to Forman, about 
7,000 students signed up 
for 
StudyBuddies 
at 
the 

University of Michigan last 

semester and the number 
increased to almost 13,000 
for the winter semester. 

“That’s 
a 
tremendous 

amount 
of 
the 
(U-M) 

community that now has 
people to reach out to if they 
need it,” Forman said. “Not 
every single one of those 
people ended up reaching out 
and forming a necessarily 
deeper friendship, but every 
single person had someone 
to reach out to in a time of 
need.” 

Jindal said more than 25% 

of all the StudyBuddies users 
who formed study groups 
met more than five times. 

Engineering 
freshman 

Nicolette Kleinhoffer said 
she utilized StudyBuddies 
for her classes last semester 
and had a positive experience 
even 
though 
not 
every 

student she matched with 
was responsive. She said 
people in her Math 115 study 
group 
always 
responded 

quickly which was especially 
beneficial since synchronous 
class time was limited. 

“For my math class, if we 

(my 
classmates) 
ran 
into 

issues, we had this group chat 
where we could say, ‘Hey, 
I keep getting this answer 
wrong, I think this part is 
wrong … what do you think 
I should try?’” Kleinhoffer 

said. “It was a place to ask 
for advice without having 
to go straight to a professor 
or GSI (Graduate Student 
Instructor).”

Kleinhoffer also said the 

StudyBuddies 
group 
chat 

was 
useful 
for 
catching 

up 
on 
assignments 
and 

notes in addition to being 
a 
collaborative 
space 
to 

help members understand 
concepts from their classes. 

“If 
you 
missed 
class 

or 
something, 
you 
could 

get notes from the people 
who were in your classes,” 
Kleinhoffer said. “Or if you 
weren’t really clear on an 
assignment, you could ask 
them, and that helped me a 
lot too.” 

Due 
to 
the 
success 

of 
StudyBuddies 
at 
the 

University this past semester, 
Forman and Jindal sought 
to expand the site to other 
colleges.

“We saw it doing really 

well at Michigan, we saw it 
was helping people,” Jindal 
said. 
“So 
then 
we 
were 

thinking, ‘Hey, this winter 
semester is going to be mostly 
virtual at pretty much every 
school in the nation. How 
do we bring this to another 
school?’ So we reached out to 
some contacts that we had: 
one at UChicago and one 
at UCLA. Because they’re 
on the quarter system, we 
knew that if we could launch 
at this perfect time — right 
before classes start, we could 
give them study groups.”

According 
to 
Forman, 

about 
one-third 
of 

undergraduate students at 
the University of Chicago and 
one-tenth at the University 
of California at Los Angeles 
signed up for StudyBuddies. 
While the site has a presence 
at these institutions, Forman 

and Jindal said they want to 
primarily focus on improving 
and expanding StudyBuddies 
at the University for the time 
being. 

StudyBuddies 
will 
look 

a 
little 
different 
this 

semester compared to the 
fall semester. To make the 
connection between students 
more seamless, StudyBuddies 
will send students an email 
with a GroupMe link specific 
to the small group they 
matched with any particular 
class.

“Going 
forward 
for 

this semester, we did two 
things,” Jindal said. “One, 
we were more focused on the 
community. Two, we were 
also more focused on the 
actual connection itself. We 
are sending everyone a group 
chat link.”

This 
concentration 
on 

community 
and 
seamless 

connections led Forman and 
Jindal to create an offspring 
of StudyBuddies, called Find 
My Class GroupMe — a site 
where any student can find 
and join larger class-wide 
GroupMe chats. 

“We’ve been thinking a 

lot about ‘community’ and 
how to create community 
in the classroom, and a lot 
of thought went into that 
this semester — trying to 
understand 
what 
actually 

does 
create 
community,” 

Jindal said. “Like, ‘Why did 
StudyBuddies work, and what 
we can do going forward?’ 
That’s been a challenge. And 
that’s why we ended up, for 
this semester, creating this 
larger community group chat 
— that’s what Find My Class 
GroupMe is for.”

A significant number of Ann 

Arbor suburbs and individual 
houses have racially-restrictive 
sections in their covenants — which 
bar people of color, particularly 
Black 
Americans, 
from 
home 

ownership — according to research 
from University of Michigan Law 
professor Michael Steinberg and 
Urban Planning assistant professor 
Robert Goodspeed.

Goodspeed 
and 
Steinberg 

presented their findings to the Ann 
Arbor Planning Commission on 
Jan. 12, looking to raise awareness 
about the covenants included in 
many Ann Arbor residents’ deeds 
and the looming presence of 
racism they said many locals are 
ignorant of.

“Most Ann Arbor residents 

believe 
that 
they 
live 
in 
a 

progressive community that is 
enlightened on issues of race,” 
Steinberg wrote in a February 
2020 letter to the members of 
the project committee. “Racism 
and white supremacy may plague 
many other parts of the country, 
the thinking goes, but Ann Arbor 
is an island where people of color 
have enjoyed equal opportunity 
for 
generations. 
The 
reason 

Ann Arbor neighborhoods are 
still segregated, many think, is 
because housing prices are so high 
in the city, not because of race 
discrimination.”

But 
despite 
Ann 
Arbor’s 

progressive reputation, Steinberg 
and 
Goodspeed 
found 
66 

subdivisions within the Ann Arbor 
city limit with some variation 
of racial discrimination in their 
covenants, pointing to the legacy 
of institutionalized racism in the 
community.

“(The covenants) were private 

agreements, 
mostly 
in 
new 

subdivisions when a developer 
came in in order to get funding 
from the banks or government, 
they wanted to make it an 
exclusively white neighborhood,” 
Steinberg told The Michigan Daily. 
“And so there would be portions 
of the deed next to ‘no fences or 

no frats’ that would say certain 
things.”

One of the most common 

racially-restrictive 
covenants 

present in Ann Arbor reads: 
“no part of said land shall be 
occupied by persons not of the 
Caucasian race except as guests 
or servants.”Other covenants say 
only people of the Christian faith 
are allowed to live on the property, 
Steinberg said in the planning 
commission meeting.

The racist agreement is typically 

listed under agreements that the 
homeowner must sign. When 
Steinberg bought his first house on 
the Old West Side in 1985, he was 
surprised when he found out that 
the house has a racially-restrictive 
covenant. 

“I read through my closing 

documents and talked to my real 
estate agent and I said, ‘What is 
this, I can’t believe this is part of 
the house I’m buying,’” Steinberg 
said. “She responded that it wasn’t 
enforced, and that I shouldn’t 
worry about it because there are 
lots of houses in Ann Arbor with 
the covenants.” 

When 
Steinberg 
originally 

talked to a lawyer about removing 
the racial covenant in the 1980s, 
he said he was told the removal 
process was long and expensive 
and an attempt to remove it was 
not worth it. Steinberg’s current 
house also has a racially-restrictive 
covenant in its deed, he said.

The covenants are no longer 

enforceable, as the 1948 Shelley 
v. Kraemer Supreme Court case 
ruled 
that 
racially-restrictive 

covenants are in violation of 
the 14th Amendment, the equal 
protection clause. 

“Before 1948, if I sold my house 

to a Black family, my neighbor had 
the ability to sue me, preventing 
a Black person from buying the 
house,” Steinberg told The Daily. 
“And the courts upheld them. They 
said this is a private agreement 
among all neighborhood residents, 
and Michigan Supreme Court held 
that it was constitutional to enter 
into these private agreements.”

After living in Ann Arbor for 

36 years, Steinberg told The Daily 
he promised himself that one day 

he would do something about the 
covenants. He runs a clinic at the 
Law School called The Civil Rights 
Litigation Initiative. His clinic 
gives students the opportunity 
to work on civil rights cases in a 
professional clinic setting. 

“We decided that we would 

make one of our projects a project 
to educate people about racially-
restrictive covenants in Ann Arbor 
and to work with policymakers 
to show how racially-restrictive 
covenants 
cause 
housing 

segregation and discrimination 
today,” Steinberg said. “And then 
take action to eliminate them on 
homes in Ann Arbor.”

Steinberg’s work in the clinic 

has extended to a committee 
including community members, 
city officials, students and other 
professors. 

The advisory board and project 

committee approach this topic 
with an open-ended educational 
aspect, as well as a hope to create 
policy 
changes, 
according 
to 

Goodspeed. 

Goodspeed is working with the 

committee to create an interactive 
map of Ann Arbor that will show 
which 
houses 
have 
racially-

restrictive covenants on them. 
Mapping these covenants can help 

to influence policy makers, call 
for legislative action and assist in 
community education, Steinberg 
said in the planning commission 
meeting. 

Kiera O’Connor is a youth 

activist on the committee who 
has been working closely to 
develop 
community 
education 

programs. 
At 
the 
Planning 

Commission meeting, she said as 
a young woman of color, it’s hard 
to imagine closing on a house and 
then finding a racially restrictive 
covenant in the documents.

“You know you’re buying this 

wonderful house and you’re so 
excited,” O’Connor said at the 
meeting. “And then you see this 
and you just don’t really feel 
welcome in the community. And 
it’s just, it’s really just imagining 
how uncomfortable that would 
be. And also, these restrictive 
covenants have kind of created 
Ypsilanti in a way, because they 
drove people of color out of Ann 
Arbor.” 

Naina 
Agrawal-Hardin, 
a 

member of the advisory board 
committee, said racial zoning — 
legal practices in urban planning 
designed to exclude racial and 
ethnic minorities — is responsible 
for creating predominantly white 

communities that isolate people of 
color. 

“It’s one piece of a much broader 

societal puzzle that is still telling 
people of color, and especially 
Black people, that they don’t belong 
in certain sectors of society, or that 
they’re not good enough to live in 
integrated neighborhoods to go 
to integrated schools,” Agrawal-
Hardin told The Daily. “And that’s 
just so fundamentally unjust.” 

The 
life 
expectancies 
in 

Washtenaw 
County 
and 
the 

neighboring Wayne County have 
over 6.5 years difference, and this is 
just one of the problems that racial 
zoning creates, Agrawal-Hardin 
said. 

These problems are shown in 

disparities between Ann Arbor and 
Ypsilanti. In an article comparing 
Ann 
Arbor 
and 
Ypsilanti 

opportunities, Ann Arbor had 
much higher levels of job access, 
neighborhood stability, economic 
well-being, and health rankings. 

Steinberg said he and the 

committee 
are 
focused 
on 

providing 
education 
on 
racial 

covenants in hope for a solution 
in the future. The educational 
outreach committee is focused 
on making curriculum for K-12 
students in the Ann Arbor and 

Ypsilanti area, Agrawal-Hardin 
said.

It is difficult to do a lot of 

community outreach during the 
pandemic, but the project is just 
at its beginning and will hopefully 
be ready for community education 
when COVID-19 is over, Steinberg 
said. 

Goodspeed said the research 

of the project has continued 
throughout the pandemic and is 
manageable to work from home on 
it.

“It’s moved a lot quicker than 

we expected from the goodwill of 
different stakeholders,” Goodspeed 
said. “The title industry and 
company allowed us access to their 
proprietary files to speed up our 
ability to discover subdivisions that 
have spatial covenants. In addition, 
the County Register of deeds is 
very supportive, giving us access to 
files.”

Agrawal-Hardin 
said 
the 

planning 
committee 
is 
eager 

for more information about the 
covenants to be released. 

“I want people to know: it’s not 

your fault that you don’t know 
about (the covenants) because 
there’s been a concentrated effort, 
both where we live and in the rest 
of our country and in the rest of 
our world, to cover up and deny 
and minimize the these histories of 
discrimination,” Agrawal-Hardin 
said.

In the future, Steinberg said 

he hopes the project will be able 
to provide community education 
on the history of these covenants 
and eventually remove the racial 
covenants from the deeds. 

“Part of the reason we’re doing 

this is to illustrate that Ann Arbor 
thinks it’s enlightened on racial 
justice issues, and that there’s 
no history of white supremacy,” 
Steinberg said. “But, there’s no 
better way, in our view, to bring 
that point home than to show that 
the very homes that thousands of 
people are living in have racially-
restrictive covenants that prohibit 
people of color to live there.”

U-M research raises awareness of racially 
restrictive covenants in Ann Arbor housing

Two ‘U’ professors find 66 A2 subdivisions with racially discriminatory terms in contracts

Combs took two of Chen’s 

courses during his time at the 
University 
and 
also 
attended 

the same church as Chen, where 
Combs said he had gotten to know 
Chen and his family very well.

“When I saw the email I was 

like, this has to be a typo or 
something, this is just crazy,” 
Combs said. “I just wanted to read 
through the email three or four 
times to just process what they 
were saying and accept it.” 

Engineering 
junior 
James 

Vidano is currently enrolled in 
Chen’s EECS 482 class and said he 
was also surprised when he found 
out about the allegations against 
Chen. 

“In class, we talked about him 

as being a super smart, legendary 
figure who designs computer 
science courses and just knows an 
insane amount about the whole 
computer science world,” Vidano 
said. “It was really surprising, it 
was the last person we (would) 
possibly expect to be in this 
situation.”

EECS 482 is taught by three 

different professors, and Chen 
had not yet taught a lecture before 
being put on administrative leave, 
Vidano said. The lecture has not 
met since the news about Chen was 
released, according to Vidano, and 
the class has not yet acknowledged 
the situation.

On Ratemyprofessors.com, a 

site where students rank their 
professors in terms of difficulty, 
likability 
and 
quality, 
Chen 

receives a high rating of 4.6 on a 
5-point scale. He also received 
a 99% rating on University of 
Michigan’s course atlas, which 
provides 
course 
information 

like enrollment numbers and 
instructor ratings based on data 
collected from previous semesters. 

Chen has also been awarded 

the 
Eta 
Kappa 
Nu 
EECS 

professor of the year five times, 
which takes undergraduate and 
graduate students’ opinions and 
experiences into the selection of 

the award. The award is given 
to a professor who has made 
beneficial contributions to the 
community and had a profound 
impact on students.

Ross and Engineering junior 

Gloria Stach was enrolled in 
Chen’s ENGR 100 class a year 
ago, which she said motivated 
her to learn more about computer 
science. 

“I was completely shocked and 

still kind of in disbelief, of the 
news that came out today, just 
because I remember from day 
one in class, he would talk about 
how he was such a religious man 
and he was also a family man, 
and he seemed to have very high 
morals and standards,” Stach 
said.

The 
announcement 
comes 

after recent controversy in the 
CSE 
department 
regarding 

the appointment of assistant 
professor Jason Mars, who faced 
allegations of sexual misconduct 
at his startup Clinc in Feb. 2020, 
to teach EECS 370 for the winter 
2021 semester. An email template 
calling for Mars’ removal from 
teaching the course, which is 
required for all EECS majors, 
circulated over winter break, 
though Mars continues to be an 
instructor for the class.

Elkolaly 
said 
Gallimore 

emphasized in the meeting the 
rarity of two professors in the 
same department getting accused 
of sexual misconduct in one 
year, referring to both Mars and 
Chen. Elkolaly said she thinks the 
decision to keep accused faculty 
on staff has made it difficult for 
students to focus on learning.

“With Jason Mars, he was on 

tenure, and the administration 
basically said that he’s still 
teaching because he did not do 
anything to remove his status 
as a professor,” Elkolaly said. “A 
bunch of other women that are 
terrified to go to class now would 
say otherwise — I’m of the opinion 
that it shouldn’t even be an option 
to interact with him.”

Chen was appointed to interim 

chair of the CSE department after 
predecessor Brian Noble stepped 

down two weeks after the first 
public allegations against Mars. 
Only six months later, Chen also 
stepped down from the position, 
citing “personal reasons” in an 
email sent to COE faculty in July 
2020. 

Separate from the allegations 

against Chen, Combs reflected 
on the typical culture within the 
University’s 
computer 
science 

department, which he said is often 
focused around getting to one of 
the top five tech companies. To 
rebuild trust and community in 
a department that has now been 
rocked by two recent allegations 
of misconduct, it needs to be more 
than that, Combs said.

“I’ve been a personal believer 

for a long time that (the computer 
science department) in general 
really 
needs 
to 
get 
serious 

about ethics and just think as 
a profession taking the human 
aspect more seriously,” Combs 
said. “Obviously, there’s an aspect 
of diversity there and an aspect of 
empathy that’s necessary.”

And even outside of CSE, 

considering the string of sexual 
misconduct allegations against 
faculty and staff at the University 
within the last few years, Combs 
said he wishes the mentality at 
the University was more that 
everyone had a responsibility 
towards society as a whole and to 
one another.

“The University often talks 

about getting the Leaders the 
Best, we often pull ourselves up 
and think of ourselves as being 
different or special, because we’re 
a little smarter, or because you 
got into Michigan,” Combs said. 
“We have been given positions 
of power, either as faculty or 
students who have been given 
the opportunity to come here, 
and I really think there is a need 
to refocus our culture on using 
that power responsibly towards 
thinking about those who are 
marginalized or those who don’t 
have a voice in our community.”

Many parents and Ann Arbor 

residents who oppose a return 
to in-person learning fear that 
opening schools could widen 
disparities that exist for people of 
color, particularly Black people, 
who 
are 
disproportionately 

affected 
by 
the 
COVID-19 

pandemic. The district, as well 
as some parents and teachers, 
also cite the lack of vaccines for 
teachers and the cluster of the 
B.1.1.7 COVID-19 variant in Ann 
Arbor as reasons to stay with 
virtual learning.

Since 
the 
state 
began 

distributing 
the 
COVID-19 

vaccine 
in 
December, 
more 

parents are pushing to put their 
children back into a classroom 
rather than in front of a screen. 
In mid-January, teachers became 
eligible to receive the vaccine 
under Phase 1B, though limited 
supply has meant that most 
AAPS teachers have not yet been 
vaccinated.

Lena Kaufman, A2R2 rally 

organizer and Ann Arbor parent, 
said the goal of the rally was to 
support 
Whitmer’s 
guidance 

and encourage schools to offer 
in-person options for younger 
students and students who have 
special needs, since their well-
being relies on professionally 
trained staff provided by the state.

“We’re 
putting 
this 
day 

together 
because 
we 
really 

believe that Governor Gretchen 
Whitmer is right about the fact 
that schools can be safe, low-
risk environments for children 
and teachers,” Kaufman said. 
“They have a lot of data now that 
backs that up over here. Her goal 
of getting kids, especially the 
youngest and special needs kids, 
giving them an option (...) by 
March 1st is quite reasonable and 
we want to show up and signal our 
support.”

Ann 
Arbor 
resident 
Sara 

Talpos, a science journalist at 
Undark 
Magazine, 
told 
The 

Daily she attended the rally 

because she was concerned about 
students’ mental health. After 
reading a New York Times article 
discussing how Las Vegas public 
schools were pushed to re-open 
due to an increase in teenage 
suicides, Talpos said she hoped 
AAPS would open safely to avoid 
this kind of mental health crisis.

“I came out because I’m really 

concerned about the mental health 
effect of keeping students outside 
of classrooms for too long,” Talpos 
said. “I know that remote learning 
is working for some kids, but a lot 
of our kids are very isolated right 
now, and our local pediatricians 
have been talking about increases 
in depression and anxiety, and the 
recent article by Erica Green on 
suicides really worries me a lot.”

Kai Cortina, a University of 

Michigan professor of educational 
psychology and parent of two 
AAPS students, spoke to the 
crowd about how his home 
country of Germany kept schools 
open while also ensuring student 
safety.

“Why is it that the Ann Arbor 

Public Schools, one of the richest 
school districts (...) is unable 
to learn the same way that the 
entire country has learned how 
to handle the crisis in schools, I 
don’t understand it,” Cortina said. 

Alan Simpson-Vlach, a math 

teacher teaching in person in 
Oakland County and parent of 
two AAPS students, said while 
he is impressed by the district’s 
investments in virtual learning 
technology, he worries about 
the impact of virtual learning on 
student achievement.

“The 
achievement 
gap 

continues to widen,” Simpson-
Vlach said. “Reading progress has 
come to a standstill. Depression 
and 
anxiety 
have 
become 

entrenched, and the well-being 
of whole families has suffered. 
Since when did the education of 
our children become a third-tier 
priority?” 

Kim 
Monroe, 
pediatric 

hospitalist and AAPS parent, also 
said virtual classes have led to an 
increase in mental health issues. 
Monroe said she believes AAPS 

is capable of safely reopening 
schools.

“By this point in time, it’s not 

even a question of whether it’s 
safe or not,” Monroe said. “It’s a 
question of whether we’re going 
to do it or not, and I truly believe 
that the AAPS teachers, school 
board and superintendent can do 
this. I believe in them and I think 
that we can make this happen.”

Ann Arbor resident Krysten 

Salla told The Daily she has 
observed a lack of resources for 
students with disabilities and 
English language learners. 

“(Students 
with 
disabilities 

and English learners) are really 
suffering and it’s really hard for 
them to get the services they 
need,” Salla said. “It’s really 
making a bigger achievement gap 
of kids that have the money and 
the resources to learn at home, 
or to get extra tutors and the kids 
that don’t, and those kids are 
really suffering.”

One Ann Arbor parent, Kristine 

McWilliams, told The Daily she 
opted to move her children to a 
nearby school holding in-person 
classes.

“Sadly, I am a former parent 

of Ann Arbor school district 
children,” McWilliams said. “I 
have a first and fourth grader, and 
virtual education was just not an 
option for us, so we transferred 
this year to a local charter school.”

Like other parents at the 

protest, 
Alan 
Simpson-Vlach 

said 
he 
believes 
that 
with 

determination and vision, AAPS 
can bring students back into 
classrooms safely. 

“I call on the leaders of my 

school district, the Ann Arbor 
Public Schools, to get off the 
dime,” 
Alan 
Simpson-Vlactch 

said. 
“Stop 
congratulating 

yourself on how well you are 
serving our top students and start 
serving all students. Get them 
back in school.”

‘CODA’ is a remarkable take 
on the coming-of-age story

The 2021 Sundance Film 

Festival 
kicked 
off 
with 

“CODA,” written and directed 
by Sian Heder (“Tallulah”). 
Based on the 2014 French film 
“La Famille Bélier,” “CODA” 
follows Ruby Rossi (Emilia 
Jones, “Locke and Key”), a 
17-year-old CODA (child of 
deaf adults). When she joins 
her school’s choir, she is torn 
between 
helping 
out 
with 

her 
family’s 
business 
and 

embracing her love for music. 
Although at times predictable, 
“CODA” provides a comedic, 
heartwarming 
and 
fresh 

perspective on the traditional 
coming-of-age 
story 
with 

some 
truly 
astonishing 

performances. 

As the only hearing member 

of her family, she works with 
her 
fishermen 
father 
and 

brother, played by Troy Kotsur 
and Daniel Durant in their 
film debuts. Completing the 
family is her mother, played 
by the brilliant Marlee Matlin 
(“Children of a Lesser God”). 
The four of them have such 
remarkable chemistry; whether 
the family is silently working 
out at sea or arguing at the 
dinner 
table, 
the 
audience 

is fully immersed in their 
dynamic. 

The 
strength 
of 
“CODA” 

truly lies in the performances 
and 
relationships 
of 
these 

four actors. Because Ruby can 
hear, she acts as her family’s 
interpreter in their work life. 
She doesn’t plan on leaving 
home and going to college until 
her choir teacher (Eugenio 
Derbez, “The Book of Life”) 
encourages her to audition for 
the Berklee College of Music. 

Ruby’s passion and talent 

are beautifully struck against 
the pressure that she feels 
to stay and help her family. 
Heder creates a vivid life for 
these 
characters, 
flawlessly 

demonstrating the role that 
Ruby has played in her family 
since she was a child. But 
the members of her family, 
particularly her parents, are 
given the same depth and 
compassion. 
They 
too 
are 

conflicted, bearing the same 
worries that any parent has 
about their child growing up 
and leaving for college.

This conflict is beautifully 

expressed in what are arguably 
two of the best scenes in the 
film. At Ruby’s choir concert, 
her family sits in the audience, 
excited to see her perform. But 
they also watch as the people 
around them clap along to the 
beat of the songs or are moved 
to tears by the performances. 

The sound cuts out (the 

only time it does in the film), 

showing the separation that 
exists between the two things 
that 
are 
most 
important 

in 
Ruby’s 
life. 
After 
the 

concert, as Ruby and her 
dad 
sit 
outside 
together, 

he asks her to sing her solo 
for him. He rests his hands 
on her throat as she sings, 
feeling the vibrations of her 
vocal cords. This moment is 
intimate and beautiful, and it 
perfectly encapsulates all the 
conflicting emotions that the 
characters face throughout 
the film. 

“CODA” 
is 
a 
brilliant 

addition to the coming-of-
age genre. While there may 
be many films about the 
anxieties of a high school 
senior about to leave home, 
there are none quite like this. 

Despite 
its 
formulaic 

qualities, “CODA” is moving 
and distinctive, packing an 
emotional punch by using a 
somewhat overused plot to 
tell a unique story, one that 
has historically been rare to 
find in the film industry. 

But, perhaps this won’t be 

the case for much longer. The 
cast and crew of “CODA” are 
calling for more collaboration 
between the deaf community 
and Hollywood. While it’s 
been a long time coming, 
hopefully, “CODA” is just 
the 
beginning 
of 
a 
new 

wave 
of 
representation.

The final day is just like any other in ‘How It Ends’
The final day is just like any other in ‘How It Ends’

I definitely wouldn’t survive 

an apocalypse. I’m blind without 
contacts, would probably be 
ambushed while flossing and 
have no real discernible survival 
skills. Luckily, a long, drawn-out 
apocalypse is not how it ends for 
Liza (Zoe Lister-Jones, “Band-
Aid”). Instead, Liza’s final day 
on Earth begins with someone 
stealing her car and forcing her 
on an oddly casual walk through 
the city of Los Angeles to make 
her way to a party; the looming 
presence of mortality is a meteor 
casting only a small shadow over 
the entire day. 

 Directed and written by 

Lister-Jones and Daryl Wein 
(“White Rabbit”), “How It Ends” 
follows Liza and a younger 
version of herself (Cailee Spaeny, 
“The Craft”) as they traipse 
across LA, righting wrongs, 
embracing flaws and yelling at 
Liza’s awful hipster ex Larry 
(Lamorne Morris,“New Girl”). 

Spaeny’s 
younger 
Liza 

is 
quickly 
brushed 
off 
as 

metaphysical 
— 
generally 

unseen by the world, she’s a 
voice of nostalgia and innocence 
throughout 
the 
film. 
Their 

relationship eventually comes to 
a head in a teary confrontation, 
forcing the audience to consider 
the difference between a healthy 
connection with your younger 
self and never letting go of the 
past. 

Following 
the 
premiere, 

Lister-Jones 
and 
Wein 
sat 

down with members of the cast 
to answer questions about the 
film. The one on everyone’s 

mind: How in the world do you 
make a film during the middle 
of a pandemic? The directors 
talked about working through 
the beginning of the pandemic 
through film, a kind of therapy 
for the two of them (of course, 
not in place of actual therapy, 
another joke cracked by Wein). 

They noted that shooting 

occurred mostly during the 
spring and summer of 2020 and 
it’s obvious; Lister-Jones and 
Wein created an apocalypse 
film that carries the peaceful 
atmosphere of pandemic bread-
making and a time before the 
BA test kitchen fell to pieces. 
Given the timing of filming, that 
also meant that the actors stood 
several feet apart during many 
of the shots and everything 
was 
filmed 
outside. 
Safety 

precautions 
lent 
themselves, 

surprisingly, to beautiful wide 
shots of the streets of LA. 

 It’s not just the visual aspects 

of the film that were affected by 
pandemic precautions. “How 
It Ends” consists of a series of 
cameos within scenes made up 
of Lister-Jones, Spaeny and one 
to two other people, some who 
weren’t even in the room. 

Finn Wolfhard (“It”) makes 

an appearance over Facetime, 
and Sharon Van Etten performs 
a haunting original song that 
highlights the tension between 
young Liza’s naive sense of 
ambition 
and 
older 
Liza’s 

hesitations 
about 
singing 

with a stranger. Nick Kroll 
(“Big 
Mouth”) 
is 
the 
first 

person to acknowledge Liza’s 
metaphysical 
younger 
self: 

Until this final day on Earth, 
younger Liza was invisible to 
the world. 

The meeting between the 

three 
characters 
begins 
to 

establish 
the 
metaphysical 

Liza in the “real” world, while 
simultaneously instilling the 
fear of dying alone into both the 
characters and the audience. 
This 
setup 
of 
encounter 

after 
encounter, 
borne 
out 

of necessity, is still able to 
provide the kind of narrative 
satisfaction we find in classic 

ensemble films like “Valentine’s 
Day” or “Love Actually.”

 And while these cameos 

push the story along, it’s the 
relationship between Liza and 
her younger self that makes 
the film such a relatable piece, 
despite the fact that none of us 
are making our way to a party 
anytime soon. 

The pandemic has forced 

many of us back into childhoods 

we thought we left behind 
once entering college; who 
would have thought I would 
be spending my senior year 
typing up a Sundance review, 
not in the comfort of my dorm, 
frantically trying to finish 
before a night out, but casually 
in my room with my parents 
next 
door? 
My 
transition 

wasn’t even that jarring — I 
had the habit of returning 

home most weekends, to see 
my dog, to use the kitchen, 
normal things. 

But when school closed and 

relaxing 
jaunts 
home 
were 

required extended stays, a lot of 
us started walking around with 
a shadow of our younger selves, 
analyzing 
past 
encounters, 

revisiting old friends, though 
without the impending doom of 
a meteor. Just a virus.

 ‘Cryptozoo’ is Wes 
 Anderson meets LSD

In a U.S. base on Okinawa, 

just after World War II, a little 
girl dreams of the atom bomb. 
A creature called the Baku 
comes to eat her nightmares. 

This girl, named Lauren 

and played by Lake Bell (“In a 
World”), grows up to become a 
Cryptid rescuer, saving beings 
like the Baku from those who 
seek to imprison or exploit 
them. She takes the creatures 
to the Cryptozoo, just outside 
San Francisco. 

Written and directed by 

Dash Shaw (“My Entire High 
School 
Sinking 
Into 
the 

Sea”), 
“Cryptozoo” 
debuted 

as part of Sundance’s “Next” 
series, which they describe as 
“original visions and genre-
defying work.” A kaleidoscopic 
vision that’s completely hand-
drawn, “Cryptozoo” is more 
than just original — it’s a 
singular, electrifying vision. 

During the Q&A session 

following 
the 
film, 
Shaw 

cited a quote from Picasso as 
inspiration: “Everything you 
can imagine is real.” Under 
the supervision of Animation 
Director 
Jane 
Samborski 

(“Hitiro 
The 
Peasant”), 

“Cryptozoo” 
fulfills 
this 

promise, making incredible use 
of its animated composition to 
bring its fantastical narrative 
to chimeric life. 

Each 
frame, 
literally 
a 

painting, bursts with color, 
texture 
and 
secrets. 
The 

visuals 
also 
transform 
to 

suit the story’s mood, going 
anywhere from the photo-
realistic 
to 
the 
insanely 

abstract, conveying emotion 
so 
powerful 
it 
becomes 

overwhelming. 

Inspired by the aesthetic 

and perspective of late 1960s 
radical 
art, 
the 
movie’s 

no-holds-barred 
approach 

to sex and violence is also 
startlingly unique in American 
animation, giving the story a 
lingering weight that’s hard to 
shake. It’s a beautiful acid trip 
combined with a nightmare, 
then 
illustrated 
by 
Blake, 

Bosch and Basquiat. 

The film is set in 1967 

when Lauren is on a race to 
find the Baku before the U.S. 
government captures it. The 
Feds seek to use its dream-
eating powers to consume 
those of the counterculture, 
snuffing out the hippies and 
protesters for good. Traveling 
with a Gorgon (one of the 
snake-haired beasts of Greek 
mythology) 
named 
Phoebe, 

who Shaw described as a 
“human-passing” 
Cryptid, 

Lauren’s quest takes her from 
snowy Russian peaks to a 
small Kentucky town. Led by 
Bell, the cast, which includes 
Michael 
Cera 
(“Arrested 

Development”) 
and 
Grace 

Zabriskie (“Twin Peaks: The 

Return”), sells the wonder 
and agony of a world where 
Cryptids walk among us. 

“Cryptozoo” 
combines 

the 
speculative 
wit 
of 

Kurt 
Vonnegut, 
the 
visual 

surrealism of David Lynch 
and the aloof humor of Wes 
Anderson, with a helping of 
“Jurassic Park.” It’s more than 
this 
clumsy 
approximation, 

though. “Cryptozoo” isn’t just 
strange for strangeness’s sake 
— there’s a reason behind its 
madness, a bedrock of meaning 
beneath 
its 
shimmering 

psychedelic veneer. 

“Cryptozoo” is about being 

strange in America. Be it 
different 
races, 
sexualities, 

gender identities or species, 
this country has not been kind 
to those who aren’t WASPs. The 
movie references imperialism, 
marriage and Disney World 
but, however, it’s manifested, 
the 
Cryptids 
are 
violently 

oppressed 
by 
an 
imposed 

normality, 
which 
seeks 
to 

snuff out their colorful lives. 
They’re assaulted, demeaned, 
boxed in or given a price tag by 
every human they meet. It’s no 
wonder they want to escape. 

In 
2021, 
when 
American 

institutions have wrought more 
havoc than they have in decades, 
the 
box 
office 
charts 
are 

dominated by carbon-copies and 
humans 
continue 
destroying 

the environment, “Cyptozoo’s” 
anthemic strangeness couldn’t 
have come at a better time.

s 

‘Ailey’ is a venerable portrait of a titan of American dance and his demons

“Alvin Ailey is black, and he’s 

universal,” said the late Cicely Tyson 
of the celebrated choreographer 
and hero of American dance when 
he received the Kennedy Center 
Honors in 1988. Jamila Wignot’s 
(“Town Hall”) new documentary 
“Ailey” chronicles the life of its 
namesake with attention to his key 
works. Woven into the story of his 
life, the documentary shows the 
work of the contemporary company, 
performing modern dance infused 
with Ailey’s spirit.

An only child born to a single 

mother in Texas in 1931, Ailey drew 
on his experiences in youth to tell a 
story of what it means to be Black in 
America. Shari Frilot, the curator 

of Sundance Film Festival’s New 
Frontier program, introduced the 
film as a showcase of Black joy. 
This joy, interlaced with coexistent 
Black pain, is richly layered and 
powerfully present in the archival 
footage of Alvin Ailey American 
Dance Theater performances and 
interviews with Ailey. The film, 
and much of Ailey’s choreography, 
functions as a reverential ode to 
Black perseverance through music 
and movement.

Ailey 
found 
dance 
after 

moving to Los Angeles as a child, 
where in the Ballets Russe de 
Monte-Carlo he discovered a 
“new world.” As a Black man, his 
own relationship with dance was 
energized by Katherine Dunham, 
whose movement, Ailey said, 
“touched something Texas in 
me.” From his first encounters 

with the art, Ailey drew on 
memory, personal and collective, 
harnessing his own emotion to 
stir emotion in his viewer.

His 1960 work, “Revelations,” 

which became one of his most 
renowned 
works, 
is 
virtuosic 

physical poetry about the history 
of Black experience in America. 
Rennie Harris, a contemporary 
choreographer who has worked 
with the AAADT, called the 
dancer a “physical historian.” By 
this account, Ailey was a genius 
historiographer.

The film’s most moving and 

marvelous storytelling remembers 
this genius and the toll it took. 
Ailey’s 
colleagues 
and 
friends 

reflect on the dissonance between 
man and idea; how he was used 
as a poster boy for racial progress, 
and how the immensity of his 

artistic genius overwhelmed his 
personal enclosure. His lack of close 
relationships, compounded by the 
stress of spectacular success, eroded 
Ailey’s mental health as he poured 
more of himself into his work than 
he was able to give.

This powerful feeling and Ailey’s 

emotion are resurrected by the 
stories of his peers, the footage of 
his choreography, his interviews 
and mesmerizing found footage. 
Throughout the film, we are shown 
his surroundings: Texas in the 
1930s, Los Angeles in the ’40s and 
New York in the ’70s and ’80s. 

When the company travels to 

Paris, we are transported to Paris. 
Editor Annukka Lilja did her own 
“choreography,” as Harris described 
it in the post-screening Q&A, 
beautifully bringing Ailey’s recorded 
voice into the visual present through 

montage. The effect is the telling of 
an untold story, through a novel and 
brilliantly artistic choreographic 
filmography.

Ailey died from complications of 

AIDS in 1989, but his spirit lives on. 
Judith Jamison, dancer and second 
AAADT artistic director, recalled 
that Ailey’s last breath was an 
inhale; she sees the continued work 
of the company as his collective 
and enduring exhale. The splendor 
of this idea is representative of the 
film as a whole, which is a poetic 
biography of a man who fought the 
demons of fame to tell the Black 
American saga through movement.

Ailey’s “Revelations” became one 

of his most iconic works. Drawing on 
Black culture and the role of church 
therein, the dancers ooze sorrowful 
sentimentality and spirited joy. I 
found the footage of “Revelations” 

to be the most moving of the works 
included in the film. 

To meditate briefly on the title of 

this work, which evokes the book 
of Revelation and its prophecy of 
apocalypse, I am struck by the 
poignancy of this parallel. That 
such a seminal work, situated at 
the beginning of Ailey’s illustrious 
career, should have this association 
with “end times” is a sort of sweet 
reclamation. 

Ailey 
transformed 
endings

‘In the Earth’ is the first 
good COVID-19 movie

Almost a year into the pandemic 

and coronavirus-themed shows, flicks 
and literature have started to crop up. 
The early bird was that soapy soap 
opera “Love in the Time of Corona.” 
Now we’ve got bigger names but equal 
banality in movies like HBO Max’s heist 
film “Locked Down,” which featured a 
couple using the COVID-19 lockdown 
as an excuse to rob banks. These have 
largely been on-the-nose, low-hanging 
fruit — the media gunning for brownie 
points that we, the socially isolated and 
under-vaccinated public, are loath to 
distribute.

And yet, it’s a little strange when the 

new fare we watch features bustling 
crowds of happy people, blissfully 
unaware that their immune systems 
are gloriously, divinely exposed. “In 
the Earth” strikes that balance. It’s a 
rainbow fish in a vapid viral sea, and 
we can only hope it starts to share its 
scales real damn quick.

Neither “COVID” nor “coronavirus” 

are ever said, but “In the Earth” is 
very clearly set during the COVID-19 
crisis, or in an otherwise comparable 
pandemic. They’ve got their masks, 
they’ve got their hand-sanitizing 
stations and talks of quarantine 
abound. One woman apologizes for 
having not talked to anyone in three 
months. Another guy lies to his doctor 
about how much he’s been exercising 
while isolating.

“In the Earth” is completely a 

creature of the pandemic. The idea 
for the film was conceived on the first 
day of the U.K. lockdown. The film 
was shot during the summer months 
over 15 days, the first new British 
production since the crisis started. 

But, as writer-director-editor Ben 

Wheatley (“Rebecca”) was quick to 
point out in the post-premiere Q&A 
session, “In the Earth” is not about 
the pandemic — it’s a reflection of our 
times. Some traces of lockdown living 
— natural themes of isolation and its 
strain on interpersonal relationships 
— are indelibly imprinted on it, but the 
film stands on its own two legs. 

The stars of this micro-budget 

venture are small-time but guileful 
actors Joel Fry (“Love, Wedding, 
Repeat”) 
and 
Ellora 
Torchia 

(“Midsommar”). Fry plays Martin, a 
cute-as-a-button mycologist trekking 
into the fictional Arboreal Forest to 
pair up with fellow fungus scientist 

Dr. Wendle (Hayley Squires, “In 
Fabric”) and study the mycorrhizal 
mat that suffuses the environment. 

Torchia 
plays 
the 
cigarette-

smoking, coffee-swilling guide, the 
park ranger Alma. Their research 
station is a two-day sojourn through 
the woods — no bikes, no shuttles, 
no nada. “People get a little funny 
in the woods,” Martin’s doctor tells 
him. It’s easy to get lost in a two-day 
cross-country journey, and it doesn’t 
help that the locals tell of Parnag Fegg, 
some sort of woman of the woods 
or pagan monster or chthonic spirit 
or what have you that wanders the 
forest. You can see where this is going.

And you’re wrong! It’s not going 

there. Or it kinda is. It does. But it goes 
other places too. 

“In the Earth” resists clear-cut 

categorization. Establishing shots 
feature verdant expanses of ferns 
and vine-choked gymnosperms but 
are accompanied by an arresting 
synth score by Clint Mansell. This 
contrast of the natural and electronic 
is emblematic of the film as a whole. 

While clearly a child of horror and 

British science fiction, it’s wont to 
blend the supernatural and sci-fi in 
a satisfying mélange that drips with 
the energy of a precocious pre-teen 
playing around in the forest with his 
Super 8. The film’s primary vehicle 
is that of slashery, “survive-alone-
in-the-woods” type horror — after 
an uneventful day in the woods, 
the immediate concern for Martin 
and Alma is an ax-wielding weirdo 
(played with razor-sharp skill by 
Reece Shearsmith, “High-Rise”) who 
likes photography. 

But the film’s second act takes 

a turn into the (visually and 
conceptually) psychedelic, an almost 
literally psilocybin-fueled flip that 
amalgamates folklore and science-
gone-wrong. As dazzling as that 
sounds, the latter half of the film is the 
weaker one. Once the science mumbo 
jumbo is introduced, it’s rapid fire. 

The relative emptiness of the 

characters 
becomes 
apparent: 

Martin is private and panicky, Alma 
is cool and capable and that’s that. 
But these are forgivable sins — this is 
a lean, spartan story that knows not 
the meaning of the words dilly nor 
dally. And it’s psychedelia — dazzling 
and a tad confusing is kind of the 
point.

I was wary about “Passing” 

when I found out that it was 
written and directed by Rebecca 
Hall 
(“Christine”). 
While 
I 

love her work, I tend to harbor 
resentment for white people who 
tell Black stories, especially one 
so dear to me as a mixed race 
Black woman. But after seeing it, 
noting how much of the dialogue 
was taken directly from Nella 
Larsen’s 1929 novella of the same 
name and hearing the way Hall 
clearly thought carefully about 
her work (based on her responses 
in the post-screening Q&A), any 
fears of co-opted stories were 
wiped away. 

In the Harlem Renaissance, 

Irene (Tessa Thompson, “Dear 
White People”), has a chance 
encounter 
with 
Clare 
(Ruth 

Negga, “Ad Astra”), a childhood 
friend who she had known as 
Black but now chooses to pass 
as white. Clare and Irene are 
both light-skinned Black women, 
though it’s unclear if either of 
them have a white parent or if 
their complexions were just up 
to chance. Irene has married 
a wealthy Black man and lives 
in Harlem with her two dark-
skinned sons, while the blonde 
Clare married a racist white 
man who is unaware of her true 
identity. The two women rekindle 
their friendship but are at odds 
with the other’s choices in life. 
It’s a beautiful story, and I highly 
recommend reading the source 
material. 

What’s so great about adapting 

text to film is that it adds a 
whole new layer to the literary 
experience. On the choice to film 
in a cramped aspect ratio, Hall 
said, “If you take a frame and then 

squeeze it down so that there’s no 
room for anything but the face, I 
think that you sort of signal to the 
audience that this film is about 
scrutinizing a face.” 

Beyond even the moments 

where the leading women’s faces 
are studied in attempts to decode 
their ethnic makeup, there are 
so many imperceptible changes, 
in Irene’s face in particular, 
that seem to reveal just how 
repressed the characters are — 
just how much they’re holding 
back. Irene keeps her head low 
so that she can hide under the 
brim of her hat as she hands a 
white woman something she’d 
dropped, so that the woman can 
only see this quirk with her lip, 
a sort of “survival apparatus,” 
smiling just enough so that the 
white woman doesn’t find her 
threatening 
but 
not 
enough 

so that she draws attention to 
herself. It’s heartbreaking.

I sometimes feel that the benefit 

of bringing historical fiction to 
the screen is that we can see these 
people who feel so far away in full 
color, as opposed to the grainy 
photographs in textbooks or our 
mothers’ keepsakes. 

However, Hall chose to shoot 

“Passing” in black and white. As 
I was watching, I felt that it was 
creating a comfortable distance 
between the viewer and the film, 
reminding us of our ignorance 
about untold stories, asking us to 
open our eyes and notice not the 
color of the potted plant but the 
shape it takes as it falls out of a 
window. 

Hall explained, “To make a 

film about colorism with the 
color drained out of it asks you 
to look at it as abstraction … 
You look at something in black 
and white and you accept it, but 
you’re 
undergoing 
a 
process 

of translation. Film isn’t black 

and white, it’s gray. I think that 
appealed to me because I feel that 
this is a story of nuance and gray 
areas and ambiguity.” 

There’s this incredible effect 

that shows how differently 
Thompson’s skin appears in 
different lighting, sometimes 
making 
her 
appear 
darker 

or paler — just like the main 
characters’ 
class 
status, 

passing as white or Black is all 
about the environment around 
them. The camera lingers on 
mirrors upon mirrors in the 
wealthy homes Irene and Clare 
live and leisure in; wonderings 
about what they look like to 
other people and if they’re 
black or white or gray loom 
over their heads.

When I was in high school, 

my 
literature 
teachers 

challenged us to view a story 
for what it is, to really, truly 
focus on the character rather 

than ourselves — to not search 
for ways in which we’re the 
same or how the story could 
relate to modern-day, but listen 
to what it has to say about its 
specific time. “Passing” is an 
important historical record of 
the experience of wealthy Black 
people in the art scene, as well 
as the complexities of colorism 
just a few decades removed 
from the Civil War. 

But honestly, I’m glad that we 

can see this story for what it is in 
our current world. I hope Tessa 
Thompson 
thinks 
carefully 

about the opportunities she’s 
been given as a light-skinned 
woman, 
as 
“Hollywood’s 

acceptable version of a Black 
girl.” I hope movies like this 
convince my brother that we’re 
actually pretty lucky that our 
mom is white and that the 
tragic mulatto trope really is 
just a myth.

doesn’t evaporate almost as 

soon as it arrives!

Venus’ arrival in your own sign of 
Aquarius is a boot to your self-esteem

‘Knocking’ tells a story all women know

Directed 
by 
Lyle 
Mitchell 

Corbine Jr. (“Shinaab”), a member of 
Wisconsin’s Bad River Band of the 
Lake Superior Tribe of Chippewa, 
“Wild Indian” is a thoughtful film 
that tells a narrative about trauma 
and the experience of Native 
Americans but struggles to hit the 
mark. The film misses the resonant 
pitch needed to leave a lasting 
mark on the viewer. Corbine’s 
directorial debut leaves something 
to be desired, but the thematic and 
cultural content is undeniably rich 
and valuable.

At the beginning of the film, a 

young Native boy named Makwa 
(Michael 
Greyeyes, 
“Blood 

Quantum”), abused by his father, 
turns to violence as a coping 

mechanism. In a defining moment 
for Makwa and his cousin Ted-O 
(Chaske Spencer, “The Twilight 
Saga”), a schoolmate is murdered, 
and the two boys are marked by 
this trauma for the rest of their 
lives. Makwa moves to California 
and finds success as a businessman, 
changing his name to Michael, while 
Ted-O spends decades in and out of 
prison. When they encounter one 
another after a lifetime, that boyhood 
trauma is reenacted, in a way.

Trauma is a central theme 

throughout — intergenerational 
trauma is an unfortunate fixture 
of Indigenous culture in America, 
and that motif supports the plot 
of the film. The incorporation of 
intergenerational trauma employs 
negative, 
often 
stereotyped 

portrayals of Native Americans 
as violent people with substance 
abuse issues. Whether or not this 

sort of character is necessary to 
tell a story of intergenerational 
trauma 
is 
not 
immediately 

evident.

Greyeyes 
addressed 
the 

subject during the Q&A session 
after the film: “For a long time, 
Hollywood 
portrayed 
us 
in 

grotesque ways …” Through this 
film, he was able to “reclaim and 
recontextualize that portrayal” 
of the ‘violent Indian.’ 

Greyeyes’s character is defined 

by a violent streak, a killing 
instinct kept below the surface, 
exercised from time to time in a 
controlled manner. This instinct, 
in the context of the film, reads as 
a sort of warrior complex. Rooted 
in childhood traumas, Makwa/
Michael’s sense of self is deeply 
marred by societal perspective and 
a sense of shame that borders on 
self-loathing.

In sharp contrast, Ted-O’s 

troubled life and time in prison 
belie his kindhearted nature 
and tremendous guilt. Whereas 
Makwa grew away from his 
home and past, turning to 
religion to mollify his own self-
reproach, Ted-O has carried 
his regret as a silent onus for 
decades. 

Both boys went to Catholic 

school, where a priest told a 
group of students in a chapel 
that “a tortured spirit is an 
unworthy sacrifice before God.” 
This scene juxtaposes Makwa 
and Ted-O with Cain and Abel, 
a dichotomy that forms the 
film’s key conflict. However, the 
characters seem at times to be 
too symbolic, too dichotomous 
to convince the viewer. No man 
is so simple as to be consistently 
complex.

The story is an important 

one, and the film is a victory for 
Native American representation 
in 
cinema. 
However, 
despite 

thematic 
grandeur, 
one 
can 

tell this filmmaker is a novice. 
The dialogue occasionally feels 
contrived and certain visual tropes 
fail to elevate the film to great 
heights.

In one of Corbine’s more 

successful artistic choices, the 
film is bookended by allegorical 
scenes from the past, of a Native 
man ill with smallpox, speaking 
to his mother. This more subtle 
allusion 
to 
intergenerational 

trauma and the many masks it 
wears throughout history is a 
valuable part of the film. Greyeyes 
also spoke about these scenes and 
the physical wounds suffered by 
his character throughout the film 
as literal embodiments of trauma.

There is a valuable story in “Wild 

Indian,” but much is missing. The 
characters, though fully developed, 
are given a calculated depth that feels 
artificial upon reflection. Stereotypes 
abound in the film, to varying effect 
and impact. Could we do without 
the alcoholism of Makwa’s father? 
Would physical abuse, or even the 
implied effects of having such young 
parents (his mother was 13 and his 
father 18 when Makwa was born) 
have been sufficient?

All told, “Wild Indian” starts an 

important conversation about the 
enduring hardships of Indigenous 
people in America. Unfortunately, 
the execution of this storytelling 
is flawed, and leaves the viewer 
wanting more. That said, Corbine 
certainly has more to say, and 
I imagine his future work will 
exceed and raise the standard set 
by his debut.

There’s no horror like political 

horror, 
and 
“Knocking” 
is 
no 

exception. Director Frida Kempff’s 
(“Winter Buoy”) debut feature is a 
chilling exploration of mental health, 
trauma and misogyny. Molly, played 
by Cecilia Milocco (“The Circle”), has 
recently moved into a new apartment 
when she begins to hear a persistent 
— you guessed it — knocking. The 
film follows her as she attempts to 
solve the mystery of the noises in her 
ceiling. Is she the only one who can 
hear it? Is it real? Are people lying to 
her? Just as Bong Joon Ho’s “Parasite” 
spoke to class consciousness on a 
universal level, rest assured that 
watching “Knocking” in Swedish is 
no detriment to its ability to strike at 
bare-bones human fears. 

It’s not the most subtle message 

ever. Reading the synopsis on the 
Sundance website made me feel a 
little bit like it was created from an 
algorithm that found that the phrases 
“mental health” and “gaslighting” 
were getting the most clicks online. 
Then again, it’s not the most egregious 
thing ever either, and if misogyny 
isn’t subtle, then maybe art that talks 
about it doesn’t have to be either. 
In the director’s introduction that 
played shortly before the film started, 
Kempff simply said, “We knew that 
whatever choice we made, we had to 
be bold.” 

While I’ve never experienced 

the Sundance Film Festival before, 
in-person or remote, I was a bit wary 
about how “pure” the screening 
could be when I could just turn on my 
bedside lamp when I got too scared 
— and I got scared a good amount of 
times. 

So whether you’re looking for 

frights or social commentary, Kempff 
has you covered. But actually, I 
think watching this film at home 
enhanced the experience. Hearing my 
floorboards creak and my neighbors 
arguing with each other upstairs 

made me feel like I was on one of 
those 4-D rides at the Detroit Zoo. 
You know, where they have a machine 
jerk your chair around so you feel like 
you’re riding a dinosaur? Watching 
“Knocking” when you’re a woman 
living alone during a pandemic is like a 
similarly budgeted, but higher quality, 
4-D ride at the zoo.

Some viewers might find its pacing 

frustrating, but if you lean into it, it’s 
actually one of its major strengths. At 
just 78 minutes long, you might think 
that it’d try to cram as much action 
as possible into its runtime, but its 

self-restraint is admirable. I knew I 
was watching a horror movie, so I 
started out with my shoulders in my 
ears, just waiting for something awful 
to happen. Then it coaxed me into 
complacency as the beginning lull 
kept rolling, as Molly buys groceries, 
smokes cigarettes on her balcony 
and tries to cool off in a heatwave. It 
doesn’t rely on jump scares, instead 
letting the isolation and quiet slowly 
drive screws into your spine. 

‘Wild Indian’ is a win for Native American cinema, but falls short on storytelling

SUNDANCE 2021

Romeo and Juliet 
make a modern 

reappearance in ‘R#J’

Director 
Carey 
Williams 

(“Emergency”) makes his feature-
length debut at Sundance this year 
with “R#J,” a bold reimagining of one 
of the most well-known love stories of 
all time, told entirely through social 
media. Shakespeare’s tragedy “Romeo 
and Juliet,” like many of his other 
plays, has a long and storied history of 
adaptations. Williams’s take on it uses 
Instagram, iMessage and Facebook 
to tell this story in an innovative way, 
switching from one character’s phone 
to another, with the audience tuning 
in to Instagram Lives and FaceTimes. 

The film feels simultaneously 

invasive — we see Romeo slide into 
Juliet’s DMs before they actually meet 
— and a little bit too familiar, as we are 
already spending ample time in our 
daily lives staring at exactly the kinds 
of screens replicated in the film. 

The most striking aspect of this 

film is, of course, the form it uses to tell 
the story. The form is both limiting, in 
that we cannot see personal, intimate 
moments between characters when 
there is no phone in sight, as well as 
creatively freeing because the film is 
able to introduce new elements of the 
characters. The filmmakers make 
the bold decision, for example, to 
have Romeo be a ‘dark-mode’ kind of 
person, while Juliet is a ‘light-mode’ 
type, giving the phone either a dark 
background or white background, 
respectively. 

This story invites us to make 

judgments about the characters 
based on something many viewers 
are already experts on: social media 
habits. Because of the very nature of 
social media, we are instantly able 
to place the characters into their 
online archetypes: Juliet, with her 
alt art account and a profile picture 
of her black Doc Martens with two 
differently colored shoelaces, and 
Romeo with his artfully curated soft-
boy streetwear fashion feed. 

This film takes the classic school 

assignment of “modernizing” an 
English class staple, using fake social 
media to its extreme. This is every 
fake celebrity Facebook page or 
imagined feed of a fictional character 
fully realized, with both the budget 
and the creative and artistic talent 
required to do so. Because of its roots 
outside of traditional filmmaking, it 
feels cheesy and strained at times, 
but it manages to adequately achieve 
its goal of a coherent story told 
exclusively through social media. 

The format takes some getting 

used to, and sometimes it is still 
shocking to see certain events played 
out on screen. Juliet’s very public 
suicide and Mercutio being murdered 
on Instagram live seem shocking 
until you realize that these events 
merely represent a fantastical mirror 
of exactly what our world is like now. 

We see real violence, unedited 

and raw, straight from strangers’ 
phone cameras to our own devices. 
Seeing it in an actual film is upsetting, 
especially because the reason it is so 
impactful is that it’s familiar. Romeo, 
played by Black actor Camaron Engels 
(“American Pie Presents: Girls’ Rules”), 
watches Mercutio (Siddiq Saunderson, 
“Messiah”), also played by a Black man, 
die in real-time on FaceTime. The 
country watched George Floyd die at 
the hands of the police in a video shot 
on a cell phone, in much the same way 
“R#J” presents its violence. 

Aside from its novel format, the 

film also breaks new ground by 

having an almost entirely POC cast. 
The Montagues are played by Black 
actors and actresses, and the Capulets 
are played by Latinx talent. 

“Up to this point the status quo has 

just been white people, blonde and 
blue-eyed,” Juliet actress Francesca 
Noel (“Selah and the Spades”) said in 
the post-screening Q&A session. “It’s 
revolutionary, but it’s also just the way 
the world is.”

Other 
members 
of 
the 
cast 

concurred. “As a person who does love 
Shakespeare, I think that Shakespeare 
is a beautiful poet, a beautiful artist, a 
beautiful author,” said self-proclaimed 
Shakespeare nerd Engels. “I think a lot 
of people shy away from (Shakespeare’s 
works) … especially as a Black youth.” 
Perhaps Saunderson, who played 
Mercutio, said it best: “It needed to be 
flipped on its head, it needed a new life, 
with some new color.”

Carey Williams thought of this 

film as a “mashup” of modern and 
Shakespearean language, which was 
perhaps the most impressive part of 
the film, although it, too, was a bit 
confusing at first. “I knew early on 
that I wanted to preserve the original 
text, but I wanted to put that into 
modern day,” said Williams. 

Essentially, the characters use 

21st-century slang in their texts and 
posts, but almost all spoken language is 
more or less the original Shakespeare. 
In this way, “R#J” carries on the long 
tradition of updating Shakespearean 
literature for the modern times. It 
manages to incorporate the beauty of 
Shakespeare’s original lines while also 
including current vernacular in a way 
that shows the incredible perseverance 
of Shakespeare’s storytelling. 

In addition, music is an absolutely 

integral part of this movie. “One 
thing I thought about early on was 
that this format was going to need 
music to carry it,” said Williams. “It’s 
going to need that soundtrack to pull 
it through.” 

Juliet listens to Clairo and FKA 

twigs; Romeo listens to Snoop Dogg. 
The music helps emphasize the 
fact that the characters are really 
just teenagers, something other 
adaptations sometimes forget. One 
telling example is when Juliet rebels 
against her father and posts a photo 
of her with Romeo. Her father calls 
her, and she ignores the call, instead 
turning up her music. “I was really 
focused on finding this hormonal, 
messy, tumultuous teenager who was 
really vulnerable and falling in love for 
the first time,” said Noel.

Despite its valiant effort to make 

a Shakespeare adaptation that is 
fresh, current and relevant, the film 
seems like it will be dated once the 
next Instagram or iOS update arrives. 
The interfaces of these apps we use 
everyday change, and since we use 
them every day, we get used to the 
graphics and aesthetics of these apps 
very quickly. 

However, this also means that 

graphics that fall behind the curve — 
which could take only a few months — 
instantly feel dated and out of touch. 
The point of the movie is that it is 
exactly in the current moment, and 
while it captures that moment as best 
as it can with its format, it is also going 
to be practically unintelligible to teens 
of the next generation. 

The staying power of this movie 

can really only be determined with 
time — either its graphics will age 
it into oblivion fairly quickly, or its 
classic Shakespearean backbone and 
the innovativeness of its form will 
allow it to remain relevant in the 
cultural psyche.

New year, new me: a common 

phrase used to signify growth, or at 
least the desire for it. 

The 
New 
Year 
brings 
the 

opportunity for everyone to work 
on themselves, whether that means 
working on their physical health, their 
mentality, their spirituality, etc. In 
2020, we collectively saw many signs 
pointing to the urgent need for change 
following the discovery of COVID-

19, one of them being discrimination 
towards Asian people. 

As many are aware, COVID-19 

brought along more than just sickness. 
It brought relentless xenophobic 
“jokes,” hate crimes and violence 
towards East Asians, especially since 
it was enabled by public figures like 
Donald Trump. Phrases like “At least 
I don’t eat bats,” and terms like “kung-
flu” became much more commonly 
used in the everyday American 
language. These offensive comments 
and actions have persisted because 
of a historic denial of inherent racism 

towards Asian-Americans. 

The “model minority” myth, 

created by white America to uphold a 
racial hierarchy by pitting minorities 
against each other, plays an inherent 
role in anti-Asian racism, creating 
great resentment against Asians 
who are depicted as able to achieve 
economic success and the sought-
after “American Dream.” In a Time 
Magazine article, author Viet Thanh 
Nguyen explains that this “model 
minority” mindset sets the Asian-
American community apart from 
other marginalized groups because 

compared to those communities, 
some Asian Americans receive more 
benefits from American capitalism. 

The “model minority” concept 

is problematic because it creates 
a hierarchy that allows for the 
normalization of anti-Asian racism. 
When an Asian person doesn’t fulfill 
the standards perpetuated by this 
mindset, such as the idea that they 
are studious or they play certain 
instruments, they are invariably 
deemed “less Asian.” Being “less 
Asian” denotes that they are white-
washed, not as involved in their ethnic 

communities or just an ABG (Asian 
baby girl/gangster) or ABB (Asian 
baby boy). Not only does this rhetoric 
harm the Asian community, but it also 
fails to consider the barriers that limit 
other minorities, further driving the 
wedge between them and Asians.

2020 brought rhetoric that largely 

placed COVID-19’s blame on Asians, 
escalating racist remarks to threats 
like, “Run them over,” or “We’re 
going to kill you” With COVID-19’s 
tenacious presence, persisting long 
after it was predicted to, the Asian 
community begs the question of 

whether or not there will be change 
in the society they interact with, or if 
the hate will be maintained with or 
beyond the virus. 

As long as these racist rhetoric and 

actions are the basis of how to treat 
Asian Americans, the “new me” that 
people hope for in 2021 should include 
growth in the ways they act and what 
they say. 

Make it: “New year, educated me.”

action being taken to combat this 
racism, check out President Joe 
Biden’s recent directive.)

*Writer’s Note: I feel as if this 

is definitively the last piece I will 
ever write about grappling with my 
brother’s illness as it’s time to make 
peace. I believe its final resting place 
is here at The Michigan Daily where 
it will be afforded the dignity of being 
heard by my editors. It will be read 
by my friends Siri and Duaa C. and 
my mother who dutifully give love 
to every single piece I write. And for 
that I am grateful. 

I am 16 years old when I decide 

that I will not be a mother. I am not 
entirely certain I will ever possess 
the qualities needed to be one and, 
more so, because I understand 
motherhood: what it means to be a 
mother and to unequivocally love a 
child so much so that the life they 
lead becomes your own. And I 
have thought often about this love, 
a mother’s love, a love so muddy 
and tangled, a love that knows no 
creed or consequence, a love so 
invariably tangible it renders itself 
immune to any sort of concentrated 
definability. It’s quite unlike high 
school sweetheart love or puppy 
dog love, man and car love or 
backyard garden love. Because it is 
a love that isn’t taught or learned, 
a love that asks of no qualification 
or merit, a love that isn’t newly 
discovered after 3 months of night 
classes at the local community 
college or mastery of Symphony 
No. 40 in A minor on the old 
piano from a pawn shop in West 
Lafayette, Ind., that was destined 
to never be played again. Rather, it 
is unquestioning, unflinching love, 
routine and expected, visceral, like 
the neighborhood cat named Max 
that visits every Thursday to smell 
the peonies without fail, or the 
man in the moon. And because 
of its enigmatic nature, I’d like 
to think that a mother’s love 
manifests in the most arbitrary 
yet meaningful of ways. It is wet 
bedsheets and burnt toast; bunny-
eared 
shoelaces 
and 
I-Love-

Yous whispered into concrete; 
handmade ceramic mugs from 
art class that leak coffee, tea, 
lemonade and perpetually slant 
to the right; cherry pits spat 
into grass; a pinky stuck to the 
ring finger with peanut butter; 
angry phone calls about overdue 
books from Julie Lancaster at 
the public library; and sometimes 
it’s “Childhood Brain & Spinal 
Cord 
Tumors: 
A 
Guide 
for 

Family, Friends & Caregivers” 
on the kitchen table and inky-
blue questions on how to love a 
terminally ill child. And I know 
because I’ve seen it in my own 
mother. 

In a hospital, my mother is 

my brother’s first. She is Ryan’s 
mother. 
Ryan’s 
mother 
who 

knows his height and weight. 

Ryan’s mother who knows his 
exact time and date of birth. 
Ryan’s mother who knows he 
prefers rooms that don’t overlook 
Forest Hill Cemetery and rooms 
with the TV remote attached to 
an elastic cord and nurses that 
angle their elbows just right when 
injecting 
Morphine, 
Vicodin, 

Vincristine. She is Ryan’s mother 
who knows other things too, 
like how meltdowns on the first 
day of kindergarten, overturned 
chairs and crayons snapped half, 
slurred speech, crossed eyes, 
monogrammed notes from other 
mothers with suggestions for 
expulsion and words like bully 
and 
disruption-to-the-class, 

headaches so bad he flailed and 
thrashed on the kitchen floor in 
pain, were the doing of a brain 
tumor in his cerebral cortex. And 
more so, she is Ryan’s mother who 
knew before anyone else, before 
Dr. Green and Dr. Campbell, 
before Dr. Schafer-Shapiro and Dr. 
Reddy, before nurse practitioner 
Jackie, before my father, before 
me. And perhaps it’s because only 
mothers are well versed in these 
sorts of matters. 

My brother had brain cancer 

at 6 years old, though mind you, 
cancer is the special sort of illness 
that never leaves, it burrows 
under the skin and fingernails, 
in the tongues of shoes, behind 
doorknobs and in back pockets, 
in bubbles in the honey jar and 
corduroys left to dry, and it 
took my brother’s mind and my 
mother’s soul and my father’s 
heart with it and gave back love 
and loss and shattered glass and 
rust. And being a mother to a 
son like my brother redefines 
motherhood, strips it bare and raw, 
flays it open on bathroom tile and 
unpins, untucks, unties, reduces 
it to its most carnal form, so that 
motherhood 
becomes 
wiping 

vomit off the Chinese buffet floor, 
after the fourth, the fifth, the 
sixth round of chemotherapy and 
life becomes staggered. Staggered 
around dates like Sept. 16, and 
Oct. 12, and Nov. 6. Dates for blood 
transfusions and appointments 
where the doctor talks too fast 
and the mind is too slow. And 
mostly, 
motherhood 
becomes 

acquainted with a certain kind 
of grief. One far different from 
tears cried over spilled milk, or 
the death of the goldfish won at 
the state fair after a three-month 
stint in a plastic aquarium, or over 
fractured wedding china after 
the movers rough-handle the box 
labeled fragile. Rather, it’s the 
kind of grief that wraps under 
and around the lungs, presses 
hard down on the chest so that 
the ribs begin to strain and crack, 
and even one breath becomes the 
most arduous task, it’s the kind 
of grief that hollows into the pit 
of the stomach and chips away 

at the lining, leaving marred 
holes, so that breakfast and 
acid leak into the body and 
sometimes it flashes so red hot 
it burns the heart. It is heavy 
and felt, thick and viscous, 
and it covers the floor, and 
the walls, and the windows, 
and the loose spaces behind 
the baseboards, trapping flies 
and moths, wishes made on 
shooting stars and the balls of 
feet, Get-Well-Soon cards and 
plastic forks with the prongs 
broken off. And it’s the kind of 
grief that only Rajia in Room 26 
–– whose baby I held until his 
heart gave out –– knows; and 
Dominic Jackson’s mother –– 
whose son lost so much blood 
it stained the bedsheets clean 
through, 
splattering 
shoes, 

pooling out into the hall so that 
the nurses’ station shut down 
for the afternoon –– knows; 
and the kind of grief that only 
my oldest friend Asha –– who 
lost her own mother to cancer 
–– knows; it’s the kind of grief 
that only my mother knows, 
the kind of grief that only I 
know. And above all, it’s the 
kind of grief that pushes people 
away, so that the phone calls 
and pity playdates stop coming, 
and aunts and uncles and 
family friends go on vacations 
to Northern Michigan or the 
beach instead. The hospital 
room begins to thin out and the 
neighborhood mothers don’t 
visit, and maybe it’s because 
they cannot and will never 
understand that in that room, 
motherhood becomes ashes 
and sweat and watching your 
son die. 

And in a hospital room, 

when you are all that you have 
left in this world, there comes 
a certain sort of reckoning, 
a grappling with mortality. I 
have seen my brother choke 
and gasp for air until he turned 
blue, watched him seize and 
scream and bleed. I have seen 
my mother and father cry, felt 
my spine take on weight, and 
more than anything else, looked 
death square in the eye and 
watched it tug and pull at my 
brother’s throat, bounce of the 
walls and ceiling, knock into the 
light fixture, leave irremovable 
dents in plaster and violent 
angry purple splatters that 
never seemed to fade. 

Should 
the 
tumor 
ever 

choose to grow again, my 
brother will surely die and he 
will take my mother with him, 
and this time it will not grant 
me the grace of God, mercy or 
tact, love or care, and by that 
virtue, perhaps my greatest 
fear is not my own death, but 
rather my brother’s. For what 
is a sister without a brother or 
a mother without a son.

*Content 
warning: 
this 
piece 

discusses sex trafficking and sexual 
violence* 

COVID-19 
wasn’t 
the 
only 

nightmare South Korea was dealing 
with last March. 

Going viral in late March 2020 

was the “Nth Room,” a sexual crime 
operation where women — and 
underage girls — were blackmailed 
into sexual slavery. These young 
girls, often looking for ways to help 
alleviate their financial burden, were 
recruited by trafficking operators to 
complete seemingly harmless and 
miscellaneous jobs or assignments, 
and attend conditional meetings 
with 
their 
alleged 
“sponsors” 

who would send them money in 
exchange for these deeds. These 
interactions initially occurred on 
social media services like Twitter 

before conversations were moved to 
Telegram— an encrypted messaging 
app. Here, the recruiters asked for the 
victims’ personal information, such as 
their names, bank account numbers 
and home addresses, claiming it was 
needed to deposit money to their 
accounts. The operators took this 
information and proceeded to stalk, 
blackmail and physically abuse these 
women — and order them to do such to 
themselves on video, via blackmail. All 
of these exploitative videos were then 
distributed by chatroom operators on 
Telegram to viewers who had made 
cryptocurrency transactions. 

Because the administrative user 

created eight groups on Telegram 
using ordinal numbers (i.e., 1st room, 
2nd room, etc.), the sexual crime case 
became known to the public as the 
“Nth Room” Case. Around 260,000 
users were found in association with 
the “Nth Room” and the more these 
viewers paid, the more degrading 
the content they received. The clips 

distributed went well beyond the 
nudity of these women; the women 
were forced to commit violent and 
extreme acts such as carving the word 
“slave” onto their bodies with a knife 
or harming their genitals. 

Politicians 
justified 
the 

participation of the 260,000 users. 
Congressman 
Jeong 
Jeom-sik 

remarked that viewers “enjoy these 
videos alone for self-satisfaction, 
so are we going to punish them for 
that?” The South Korean Attorney 
General Kim Oh-Soo blamed the 
girls, claiming that “It’s normal for 
teens to fool around on the computer,” 
dismissing their criminality. They 
weren’t the only politicians to express 
such tone-deaf thoughts. 

The general public was horrified. 

Over 2.7 million people in Korea have 
signed a Blue House Presidential 
Petition—a national system of political 
concern expressed via petition to the 
government and Blue House officials 
— requesting that the government 

reveal the identities of the traffickers 
and the viewers, which challenged the 
country’s norm of protecting criminal 
anonymity. Afterwards, 24-year-old 
Cho Joo-bin was identified as one of 
the chatroom administrators in late 
March, while evidence in mid-April 
revealed 18-year-old Kang Hoon as 
an underage accomplice. There’s also 
another petition where over 2 million 
people have requested that all 260,000 
viewers’ identities be revealed. 

But this isn’t enough: Korea must 

finally reflect upon its normalization 
of female objectification, which was 
made evident in the handling of the 
“Nth Room” Case. 

As a Korean girl who moved to 

America in 2010, I was ashamed of 
my motherland; these appalling 
comments from Korea’s political 
leaders only reminded me of the 
difference 
in 
progress 
between 

the modern American and Korean 
feminist movements. Unlike the more 
progressive Western feminist agenda, 

I’ve found that Korea’s deep-rooted 
history of Confucian values are often 
a justification for the subjugation of 
women. 

It’s 
offensive 
that 
Korean 

law doesn’t acknowledge child 
pornography as sexual abuse or 
exploitation, but rather as illegally-
produced films. Korean law is 
too lenient on all sexual crimes, 
which explains the proliferation of 
digital sex crimes, such as spy cam 
pornography and cyberbullying. 
Compared to sentencing in the 
U.S. for sex offenders that’s 
roughly 10 to 30 years in prison, 
sentencing for sex offenders in 
Korea is a slap in the face, as those 
who possess child pornography 
can only get jailed up to a year 
or pay a fine of 20 million won 
($18,111.68). In 2018, Son Jung-
woo received a mere 18-month 
sentence for operating one of the 
world’s largest child pornography 
sites, and South Korea even denied 

the extradition request by the U.S. 
in August 2020. Without harsher 
sentencing, how will perpetrators 
come to understand the severity 
of their crimes? How will victims 
get justice? Until then, victims will 
never feel encouraged to share 
their stories. 

Furthermore, 
Korea 
should 

change its outlook on sex, which 
is still a taboo topic. Korea is a 
sexually repressive country; porn is 
banned, and the topic of sex is rarely 
discussed by families, schools or 
even the media. In order to change 
its attitude towards sexuality, Korea 
needs to improve its sexual education 
programs in schools and normalize 
discussions about sex for students. In 
cultures where sex is taboo, people 
may repress their normal sexual 
urges so much so that it festers into 
something worse.

Make giving back the law

Reflecting on the “Nth Room” Case: Why South Korea needs a new feminist wave

New year, old jokes

You’ve Made Your Views Clear, 

Now It’s My Turn

Warren Buffett has a net worth 

of $73.5 billion. Jeff Bezos’ has one 
of $179 billion, Bill Gates has one of 
$111 billion and Mark Zuckerberg 
has one of $85 billion. If each of these 
individuals gave only 2% of their 
income to charity, that would be 
more than $28 billion raised. That 
could be used towards overlooked 
domestic issues like homelessness, 
poverty and water sanitation. This 
absurd amount of money is confined 
to only four people. Imagine, 
America, if the top five percent of 
earners, those who make more than 
$309,348 annually, were mandated 
to donate 2% of their income to the 
government that would be allocated 
towards improving the poverty rate. 
Everyone must pay taxes, but the top 
5% of earners should give an extra 
2% that should be used specifically 
for improving domestic destitution. 
It’s time for Americans to take 
responsibility for giving back to their 
community — an effort I believe 
should be mandated by law. 

It’s clear that many people with an 

excessive amount of wealth loathe to 
donate much of their money. In the 
middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
America’s wealthiest individuals 

chipped in with less than 0.1% 
(combined) of their money for relief. 
Jeff Bezos donated around $125 
million. To us, that sounds like a huge 
contribution, but when proportioned 
to his amassed wealth, it equates to 
approximately $85 for the average 
American worker. It should be an 
expectation that when you have such 
excess of wealth, at least 2% should 
be spent towards supporting people 
living below the poverty line. This 
would ensure that society’s wealth 
circulates, and that the rich do not 
become excessively rich while the 
poor do not become excessively 
poorer, working to eradicate wealthy 
America’s hoarding problem. Bezos 
himself is the perfect example when 
it comes to discussing the system of 
how the rich continue to progress 
even as the poor continue to struggle. 
In the duration of this pandemic, 
Bezos saw his wealth increase by 
approximately $48 billion. In the 
third quarter of 2020, the top 1% 
owned 31% of the country’s wealth. 
If giving back were mandated 
under the law, the amount of money 
collected can be put towards more 
practical domestic predicaments, 
which society believes would take 
hundreds of billions of dollars to 
eradicate. After all, according to 
the United States Department of 
Housing and Urban Development, 

eradicating 
homelessness 
would 

cost around $20 billion –– slightly 
less than the amount of money 
Americans spend each year on 
Christmas decorations alone.

We have become so accustomed 

to living in a country with problems 
that should not exist in the first 
place. Many of our domestic issues 
are just considered part of the norm. 
For instance, when we think about 
homelessness, we all acknowledge it. 
But we don’t reflect on what America 
would be like if the entire issue was 
eliminated. However, the answers to 
these problems are within our reach, 
far from being impossible. It seems 
impractical, yes, but solutions exist. 
In comparison to other countries, 
America is far behind when it comes 
to improving the lives of citizens in 
poverty. Take Finland, for example. 
Through Finland’s Housing First 
effort, the country has managed to 
eradicate nearly all homelessness. 
If we take the collective sum of 
everyone’s monetary contributions, 
Americans could be the leaders of 
social improvement. If America’s 
billionaires are not charitable by 
nature, it should be acceptable to 
everyone else that America can 
begin to take steps forward towards 
making progressive change, even if it 
means forcing billionaires to open 
their giant pockets.

On Jan. 6, you planned and 

executed an insurrection on the U.S. 
Capitol. You wore shirts with slogans 
and logos threatening to further 
divide an already violently divided 
nation. You fought against, and threw 
a fire extinguisher at police officers, 
while flying the symbol you claim 
represents that their lives matter. 
You carried the American flag, while 
you threatened legislators that were 
trying to defend the freedom and 
democracy the flag represents. You 
stole mail, a computer and a podium. 
You broke windows and ripped 
apart signs of the People’s House. 
You destroyed the offices of elected 
officials — and for what? To prove a 
point? Because you don’t agree with 
the results of the election? 

We’ve been through this before, 

too many times. For centuries, white 
supremacists have voiced their 
hatred and power by claiming they 
are defending the American flag, 
while in reality they are disgracing 
it. That disrespect is blatantly hung 
over our heads in the form of the 
Confederate 
flag, 
the 
ultimate 

un-American symbol, to counter 
every plea for human rights. It was 
clear when you held that flag while 

strolling through the halls of the 
Capitol, that the only thing you were 
trying to defend was your racism. 
Since you have made your emotions so 
violently clear, I’m going to talk about 
how I feel, and you are going to listen.

I’ve gone through so many 

emotions since that day. I’ve been 
disappointed even though I’ve learned 
to expect nothing less from America. 
I’ve laughed this situation off because 
I’ve become so desensitized to the 
trials of living in this country. I have 
had moments of confusion trying to 
figure out how this whole situation 
happened, but I am quickly brought 
back to reality when I acknowledge 
that these kinds of actions are in fact 
American, even though politicians 
and some in the mainstream media 
say it isn’t. I’m frustrated because 
Black people are killed just for 
existing. When we peacefully protest, 
we are arrested, tear-gassed and hit 
with rubber bullets. You walk into the 
Capitol with guns while threatening 
to hang the vice president, and get to 
pose for pictures with police officers. 
I feel hopeless because I’m constantly 
given proof of why I should be afraid 
of the country I live in. I never knew 
how far you would take it, but on Jan. 
6, you made it clear just how far you 
are willing to go. I’m crushed because 
it seems like so much work has been 

done to try and make America a 
welcoming place for everyone, but 
the cries for justice go in one ear and 
out the other, and are constantly 
dismissed and ridiculed by the very 
people who need to hear them. 

How can this hatred be so 

customary that you are willing to lose 
your lives and risk those of others? 
Why are human rights a political 
topic that we have to fight for over 
and over again? Every time we take 
one step forward, we fall ten steps 
back. How can we expect anything 
to change, when you –– and those I 
once thought I could trust amongst 
you –– are fighting to uphold racism, 
sexism and countless other harmful 
principles that are causing people to 
unfairly lose their lives? This shouldn’t 
be a problem. But it is. Seeing how 
violently divided the country is, it’s 
clear that you believe these disgusting 
ideas wholeheartedly. What will it 
take to show you that your beliefs are 
harmful? Why don’t you understand 
that white lives have never been at 
stake? White lives won’t be sacrificed 
with the results of this election. But 
everytime you suit up in your MAGA 
gear and take out your rifle, the lives 
of marginalized communities around 
you are at stake. But that doesn’t 
matter to you, does it?

Michigan Law’s administration offers little 

compassion in a pandemic

I

t’s safe to say that the fall 
2020 semester was tough 
for 
many 
undergraduate 

students, but for many University 
of Michigan Law students, it was 
downright hellish. In addition 
to eliminating Fall Break, the 
Law School also added weekend 
classes for the fall semester. 
Unlike the rest of the University, 
which held classes online after 
Thanksgiving break, the law 
school condensed its schedule 
by holding its last class the 
Wednesday before Thanksgiving.

The compressed schedule — 

as explained in a Jul. 1 email 
from the associate dean for 
academic 
programming, 
Gil 

Seinfeld, to the Law School 
community — was made in 
response to moving the school’s 
Early Interview Week. EIW 
typically occurs in the summer 
and is when many second-year 
law 
students 
interview 
for 

summer associateships at law 
firms. Due to the pandemic, 
EIW was pushed to January 
2021. Compressing the Fall 2020 
schedule was meant to allow 
grades to come out before the 
interviewing process.

Seinfeld 
acknowledged 

that the new schedule would 
be 
challenging. 
“All 
things 

considered however, this seems 
the best way to balance the 
competing needs of our student 
body,” he wrote.

Third-year 
Law 
School 

student Julia Adams disagreed. 
She argued that the school year 
could have started a week earlier 
— an approach adopted by the 
University of North Carolina at 
Chapel Hill and North Carolina 
State. Or professors could have 
been asked to grade a little bit 
faster this year. The school 
should have “put the onus on the 
people being paid,” Adams said, 
instead of putting students on 
the “chopping block.” Certainly, 
organizing a brutal schedule in 
an already brutal year seems, 
well, brutal. 

The organization of the term 

around EIW also showed Adams, 
a public interest law student who 
will not be joining a corporate 
law firm, that the administration 
did not care about “non-firm” 
students. 
The 
interviewing 

process for public interest jobs 
is less regulated — Adams had 
eleven interviews in one week.

Third-year Law School student 

Sean Brennan was incensed by 
the “lack of clear pathways for 
student input” before the fall 
term schedule was announced.

A student-produced survey, 

garnering nearly 300 responses 
and representing a wide swath 
of the Law School student body, 
found 89% of students agreed 

with 
the 
statement, 
“I 
am 

worried about my mental health.” 
In addition, 90% agreed that “the 
law school has not done enough to 
support students this semester.”

Perhaps the Law School could 

have eliminated some of the 
student distress by allowing 
students facing greater personal 
or 
mental 
health 
challenges 

than normal to take a leave of 
absence. Alas, third-year Law 
School student Everett Secor 
tried to do just that and felt led 
to believe by Lindsey Stetson, 
the associate dean for student 
life, that he may risk losing not 
only his scholarship, but also his 
enrollment. 

To Secor, it seemed that short 

of a hospitalization, the school 
would not allow him to take leave. 
To him, that decision underscored 
the school’s commitment to their 
bottom line over student well-
being. Stetson wrote in an email 
to The Daily that the decision to 
take leave is “highly personal” 
and that “we help students to 
assess their options and make the 
decision that is right for them.”

The school’s leave of absence 

policy is vague, but does not 
outline any circumstances in 
which a leave would be denied 
or students would be forced to 
reapply after a one-year leave 
period. The policy explicitly 
states 
that 
students 
must 

complete their degree within 
five years — the typical timeline 
is three years, thus allowing 
plenty of time for a leave. 
Simultaneously 
infantilizing 

students by removing their ability 
to make decisions based on their 
own 
personal 
circumstances 

whilst expecting them to endure 
an even more arduous semester 
than usual in the midst of a global 
pandemic is cruel.

Law school is taxing on student 

mental health in the best of times 
— its singular embedded CAPS 
counselor is not enough. Even 
after a Law School student died 
by suicide in 2019, there was 
no meaningful action taken to 
address mental health within the 

Law School student body. To both 
Adams and Brennan, repeated 
suggestions from the school about 
yoga and CAPS felt insulting in 
the face of more structural issues 
facing students.

After much student advocacy 

in October 2020, the Law School 
did make some small changes. 
Students were given the option to 
change one grade of a C or higher 
in both the fall 2020 and winter 
2021 term to a “P.” The exam 
period was also extended, pushed 
from ending on Dec. 11 to Dec. 
14, with professors encouraged 
to allow students to take their 
exams at any time within that 
period. 

However, Brennan pointed out 

that the changes only came about 
after intense student advocacy 
that seemed to him at times like 
“trauma porn,” where students 
felt they had to go into detail about 
their personal mental health or 
difficult family circumstances. 

The Law School could have 

mitigated a lot of the severe 
distress felt by students this past 
semester by simply listening. 
Input should have been widely 
solicited when redesigning the 
fall term schedule. Students who 
recognized that that law school 
would not be their top priority in 
the middle of a pandemic should 
have been supported in taking a 
leave of absence. 

In many ways, the refusal to 

listen parallels so many of the 
University’s mistakes in the past 
year. How much illness could 
have been avoided, for example, 
if the administration had listened 
to their own graduate students 
when they went on strike? How 
many women would have been 
spared if the University took 
sexual misconduct allegations 
seriously? 

When administrators fail to 

listen to students, it is almost 
always the students that get 
hurt. Perhaps that is why they 
never learn. 

I 

thought living in a sorority 
house was going to be exactly 
like the opening scene of 

“Legally Blonde”: girls braiding each 
other’s hair, sleepovers in the living 
room and everyone helping a girl get 
ready for a date. Obviously, because 
of the pandemic we are currently 
living through, things look a little 
different in my house. 

Masks are worn everywhere, 

there are limits to when we can use 
certain rooms and people tend to 
keep their distance. Sometimes I do 
miss playing pong in a basement that 
has some strange liquid dripping 
down the walls and making friends 
with people in bathrooms lacking 
toilet paper just as much as the next 
girl. The pandemic has robbed all of 
us of experiences that can never be 
replaced, and the impulse to go out 
and party is often very strong. But 
I have a very good reason to resist 
these impulses: I’m from Ann Arbor. 

I was born and raised in this 

quaint little town. I know it for 
warm summers on the Huron 
River and weekends spent at the 
Hands-On Museum. I learned to 
drive downtown, navigating the 
perpetual construction and taking 
back alleys and detours that led 
nowhere. And yes, Ann Arbor is 
primarily known for the University 
of Michigan, but it has always been 
so much more. 

It’s a town where people are 

unreasonably friendly, where nights 
at Top of the Park are practically a 
high school reunion, where liberal 
soccer moms can always find a 
gluten-free option, where there is a 

tangible pride in the air on late July 
nights. 

Sorority rush this past weekend 

has shown me that this pride truly 
radiates throughout campus. These 
freshmen, who have had the most 
abnormal Michigan experience, still 
talk of their pride in their school. 
This isn’t because of the University. 
With 
no 
in-person 
classes, 
a 

shortened dorm experience and no 
game days to revel in our renowned 
school spirit, this pride in our school 
must come from somewhere else: 
the city itself. 

Ann Arbor natives are proud of 

this school and of their town, and it 
shows. Over four-fifths of Michigan 
football’s season ticket holders are 
non-students, coming to campus 
each gameday and flooding the 
Big House. School spirit radiates 
through campus and is echoed 
throughout the streets of this small 
town. Even now, my neighbors 
gather on their patio every football 
Saturday to tailgate and watch the 
game as a community.

However, 
students 
at 
the 

University 
have 
been 
harming 

the Ann Arbor community this 
year. Underground frat parties, 
ill-conceived 
social 
gatherings 

and oh-so-elusive Tinder hookups 
have contributed to the rapidly 
increasing number of COVID-19 
cases in Washtenaw County. The 
University’s cases represented 60% 
of the county’s cases in mid-October, 
despite representing less than 15% 
of the county’s population. The 
Starbucks baristas and bus drivers 
that once smiled at our maize-

colored sweatshirts now roll their 
eyes, wishing we weren’t around. 

College students, you owe it to 

Ann Arbor to be better. This town, 
no matter how long you’ve been here, 
has given you a place to call home. 
The rent may be sky high and South 
U may never be truly open again, but 
Ann Arbor has given you friends, 
pizza and far too many bubble tea 
places for any one person to try. It is 
a community of people passionate 

about changing the world in their 
own unique ways, which is what 
drew so many students here in the 
first place. It used to be our secret 
pride.

Now, it’s honestly embarrassing 

to tell family and friends about my 
school. My stories are now met only 
with worried glances and timid 
questions of safety. I am ashamed of 
the “Leaders and the Best” who want 
so badly to get wasted on a Friday 

night that they can’t help but do so and 
risk other people’s lives. These are 
the lives of my community members. 
This is my home. Ann Arborites 
have poured their unwavering love 
and support into the University for 
almost two centuries. The least we 
can do is return the favor.

Thus, I end my letter with a simple 

plea. Next Friday, when the Law 
Quad crows are beginning their 
nightly journey toward the medical 

campus, put on your cutest outfit and 
FaceTime your best friend. Watch 
“Twilight” or “The Kissing Booth” 
or any other absurdly bad teen movie 
and invent your own drinking game. 
While this may not compare to the 
fun of pong on a porch, it might ensure 
that one more grandparent can join 
their family at the stadium next year.

A

t least 14 cases of the new 
U.K. variant of COVID-19, or 
the B.1.1.7 variant, have been 

identified in Washtenaw County and 
tied to the University of Michigan 
campus. While there is conflicting 
evidence on the mortality rate of this 
new strain, we know definitively that 
the B.1.1.7 variant is more contagious. 
This means that even if the new 
variant has the same mortality rate 
as the original COVID-19 virus, 
more people will die, simply because 
it spreads faster. Because of this, the 
B.1.1.7 variant being present at the 
University poses a major threat to 
the Ann Arbor community. It is vital 
that we see the reality and gravity of 
the COVID-19 pandemic and remain 
hypervigilant to protect ourselves 
and those around us.

The B.1.1.7 variant of the COVID-19 

virus was first identified in the U.K. in 
December 2020 and quickly became 
the primary variant of the virus present 
in England. Since then, multiple cases 
have been discovered in Washtenaw 
County. The Washtenaw County 
Health Department encouraged those 
who visited either the Meijer on Ann 
Arbor-Saline Road between 9 a.m. and 
10 a.m. or Briarwood Mall between 
1 p.m. and 2 p.m. on Jan. 17 to get 
tested for COVID-19 due to possible 
exposure. 

Most recently, the University 

paused athletics as a result of multiple 
student-athletes testing positive for 
the B.1.1.7 variant. Already, we have 
seen the impa scts of the higher level of 
contagion found in this version of the 
virus, and this is only the beginning. 
Even more concerning, the Food 
and Drug Administration indicates 
that the B.1.1.7 variant can trigger 
false negatives in test results more 
frequently than the original virus, 
so, while getting tested frequently is 
important, test results cannot be used 
to excuse unsafe behavior. 

This variant demands more from 

us in terms of safety precautions than 

the original version of the COVID-
19 virus. Greater precautions are 
necessary now, with the B.1.1.7 variant 
present on campus, but it is no secret 
that greater precautions have also 
been necessary at the University since 
the beginning of the fall term. The 
University’s response to the COVID-
19 pandemic was notoriously lacking 
last semester, prompting pushback 
from 
the 
Graduate 
Employees’ 

Organization, many students and 
members of the greater Ann Arbor 
community. 

In announcing the fall 2020 plan, 

Michigan’s administration promised 
symptom screening and testing. 
While symptom screening was 
available in the form of ResponsiBlue, 
an app that asked users if they had 
any symptoms, students were rarely 
required to present the screen 
indicating they had completed the 
survey when they entered campus 
buildings, rendering the program 
mostly ineffective. Though available 
at the University, testing was offered 
mainly to symptomatic individuals 
and those who had been contact-
traced, leaving the asymptomatic 
population high and dry. 

They 
only 
allowed 
all 

asymptomatic individuals to get 
tested before returning home for 
Thanksgiving. 
The 
University 

introduced the voluntary Community 
Sampling and Tracking Program at 
the beginning of September 2020 
to allow for more asymptomatic 
testing, but only a limited number of 
participants were chosen to be tested 
each week, and not all who registered 
were guaranteed to be tested at any 
point in the semester.

The underwhelming response to 

the COVID-19 pandemic was tied 
to multiple outbreaks in residence 
halls, and the University accordingly 
canceled 
most 
undergraduate 

students’ 
housing 
contracts 
for 

the winter semester. It seems as 
though the negative feedback about 

the University’s proceedings last 
term was finally received, as the 
precautions in place this semester 
are much more appropriate given the 
state of the pandemic. 

The University now requires 

students living in residence halls, 
working at the University or using 
campus facilities to be tested weekly, 
and the revamped Community 
Testing and Sampling Program 
also provides students with the 
opportunity to be tested more 
frequently if they choose to do so. 
Residence halls are now operating at 
reduced capacity, with all students 
living in single rooms. However, the 
University can only do so much.

Many students living off-campus 

disregarded 
the 
pandemic 
last 

semester, 
continuing 
to 
attend 

large gatherings and interact with 
people outside their homes, many 
times without masks. As of now, 
it seems that this behavior has not 
changed. With Fraternity & Sorority 
Life organizations recruiting and 
initiating new members, students 
have been seen in large groups, 
unmasked, at various off-campus 
houses. Though the University has 
responded to the increased threat of 
the new variant with more rigorous 
precautions, 
the 
student 
body 

seemingly has not, giving rise to 
greater concern.

It was always important for us to 

take COVID-19 seriously, but now 
more than ever, we need to buckle 
down and do the right thing. With 
the new variant being present in our 
community and being significantly 
more transmissible as the original 
COVID-19 virus strain, we must 
finally wake up to the reality of this 
pandemic and act accordingly.

The B.1.1.7 variant is no joke


2-News

I

n the early days of our 
republic, our founders were 
faced with a question of 

lasting significance; how should 
our president be chosen? Two 
potential answers arose and came 
into conflict with one another. 
Some founders supported the 
idea of choosing the president 
with a simple popular vote by the 
American 
people. 
Conversely, 

others thought Congress alone 
should select the president. 

This debate gave way to a solution 

in the middle. The president would 
neither be selected exclusively by 
a popular vote nor by Congress. 
Our chief executive would instead 
be chosen by a body of electors, a 
system that is widely known today 
as the Electoral College.

The Electoral College is one of 

the most remarkable inventions of 
our framers. It gives a tremendous 
amount of power to the people 
to directly choose the president, 
which is critical in a representative 
democracy like ours. But the 
Electoral College isn’t based on 
the popular vote alone. If that were 
the case, presidential candidates 
would likely focus solely on the 
largest states, like California, New 
York and Texas. It gives a higher 
degree of representation to small 
states like Wyoming and Alaska 
that would otherwise be forgotten. 
Through this unique system, every 
state in our republic matters. 

244 years since United States 

was founded, the Electoral College 
continues 
to 
determine 
the 

outcome of presidential elections 
every four years. But recent trends 
across the country have eroded the 
advantages of this system.

A critical component of the 

Electoral College is that major 
population centers don’t hold 
all of the power. That was true 
at first, but the framers could 
never have anticipated the rapid 
population growth of the United 
States. 

When 
this 
system 
was 

enacted, the total population of 
our country was less than four 
million people according to the 
1790 census. Today, the U.S. has 
more than 330 million people. 
But this dramatic jump doesn’t 
tell the whole story. Since more 
than 80% of Americans live in 
urban areas today, the Electoral 
College no longer represents 
the true heart of America. It 
inadvertently silences the voices 
it was intended to amplify.

There 
are 
a 
number 
of 

proposals that have been floated 
to remedy the Electoral College. 
Arguably the strongest is the 
congressional district method: 
reforming the system to allocate 
electoral votes on the basis of 
congressional districts instead 
of entire states. At the moment, 

with the exception of Nebraska 
and Maine, each state awards 
its electors through the winner-
take-all method. The candidate 
that receives the highest tally 
(technically, even if they win a 
state by a single vote) receives all 
of that state’s electoral votes. For 
instance, in the 2020 presidential 
election, Democratic president 
Joe Biden took all of Georgia’s 16 
electoral votes despite winning 
the state by a slim 0.3%.

This becomes more and more 

problematic as the U.S. continues 
to rapidly urbanize. Because 
48 out of 50 states award their 
electoral 
votes 
according 
to 

the 
winner-take-all 
method, 

urban and suburban areas have 
become unusually important. If 
a presidential candidate can run 
the table in a dense population 
center, they can virtually ignore 
the rest of the state. 

Instead of giving a voice to 

every American, the current 
system places far too much 
emphasis on a small group of 
cities. Right here in Michigan, 
much of the vote is determined 
by Metro Detroit, which contains 
more than 40% of all Michigan 
residents. The same is true in 
Chicago, New York City, Los 
Angeles and numerous other 
cities.

If the Electoral College awarded 

votes on the basis of congressional 
districts, we could effectively solve 
this problem. Determining the 
winner according to congressional 
districts would give the entire 
country a say in choosing our next 
president. While forgotten rural 
areas, in particular, would have 
the representation they deserve, 
our suburbs and urban areas 
would still have considerable 
power. Every district would be 
given a voice, and many more 
areas across the nation would be 
in play. It would become normal 
to see a Republican candidate visit 
a state like California, and to see a 
Democratic candidate visit Texas.

On the national scale, the 

congressional district method 
would 
closely 
mirror 
how 

Nebraska and Maine already 
award their electors. Instead 
of the top candidate in a state 
securing all electoral votes, each 
congressional 
district 
would 

be worth one vote, since every 
congressional district is home 
to roughly the same number of 
people. After the congressional 
districts award their votes, the 
remaining two electors (one for 
each senator) would be allocated 
to the state popular vote winner.

This proposal might initially 

seem to disproportionately favor 
the 
Republican 
presidential 

candidate since large blue states 
often have red districts who 
would give electoral votes to 

Republicans. For instance, in 
the 2020 presidential election, 
Republican 
candidate 
Donald 

Trump 
won 
congressional 

districts across Michigan and 
Pennsylvania even though he lost 
both states. Under the current 
system, Trump was awarded 
no electoral votes from either 
of these states; a reformed 
Electoral College would allocate 
a substantial number of votes 
to Trump. The same would be 
true in New York and California, 
states Biden won handily despite 
Trump performing well in rural 
areas.

But awarding votes on the basis 

of congressional districts benefits 
the 
Democratic 
presidential 

candidate too. For example, Biden 
won congressional districts in 
Texas, Florida and Ohio despite 
losing all three of these states. 
Under the winner-take-all model, 
Biden didn’t earn any electoral 
votes from these states. This 
new Electoral College would 
have awarded Biden a significant 
number of electoral votes that he 
didn’t receive under the current 
system.

If the Electoral College were 

reformed, both Republican and 
Democratic candidates would pick 
up votes in areas that otherwise 
would have been glossed over by 
the winner-take-all method. It 
truly is a system that is fairer to 
both sides. It also makes elections 
more competitive, giving every 
candidate a fair shot. Had the 
congressional 
district 
method 

been used in 2016, Democratic 
candidate Hillary Clinton would 
have lost the electoral college by a 
much narrower margin. The same 
would be true in 2020, with Biden 
prevailing over Trump with fewer 
electoral votes. 

Finally, this proposed system 

takes the emphasis off of states 
as a whole and focuses instead 
on individual districts, which are 
smaller areas that have clearer 
needs and priorities. This is 
especially important in larger 
states. For example, California 
has 53 congressional districts, all 
of which have unique situations. 
The people of California lack a 
voice when a state of nearly 40 
million people is treated as one 
unit.

Choosing the president of 

the United States is no simple 
matter. But if we want our chief 
executive to truly be a reflection 
of the will of the people, we 
need to take steps to make sure 
all corners of our republic have 
a say. If our founders had the 
opportunity to live in 2021, they 
would want nothing more than 
that.

T

he 
Republican 
reaction 

to 
Twitter’s 
decision 

to 
permanently 
ban 

former President Donald Trump is 
emblematic of today’s Republican 
Party: hypocritical and purposefully 
misleading. 
Claiming 
that 
it’s 

unconstitutional 
for 
Twitter, 
a 

private company, to ban Trump from 
their platform grossly misinterprets 
what the First Amendment says 
plainly: “Congress shall make no law 
… abridging the freedom of speech.”

The key word in the First 

Amendment 
that 
often 
gets 

overlooked is Congress. The First 
Amendment is supposed to protect us 
— the people — from the government. 
It is not meant to protect us from 
the social consequences that may 
arise because of our speech. It is not 
possible for private companies to 
violate the First Amendment. 

Republicans, while claiming to 

be the party of the Constitution, 
are lying to the American people — 
some of whom now believe that a 
private company is liable under the 
First Amendment. This goes beyond 
Twitter banning Trump. 

Simon & Schuster, a publishing 

company, 
announced 
it 
was 

canceling Sen. Josh Hawley’s, R-Mo., 
book publication for his role in the 
attempt to overturn the election 
results. Hawley responded by saying 
that the situation was “a direct assault 
on the First Amendment.”

Hawley 
is 
a 
constitutional 

lawyer 
who 
clerked 
for 
U.S. 

Supreme Court Chief Justice John 
Roberts. He knows that a private 
company cannot “assault” the First 
Amendment. Hawley, Trump and 
other Republicans who are well-

versed in the true meaning of the 
First Amendment are exploiting the 
political polarization of today to give 
themselves more political power at 
the expense of the United States and 
its citizens.

Simon & Schuster and Twitter 

— as well as the other social media 
companies that deplatformed Trump 
— are not government entities, and 
thus cannot be held accountable 
under the First Amendment. Trump 
broke its terms of service, giving 
Twitter every right to ban him and 
preventing a viable lawsuit from 
taking place. Hawley engaged in 
behavior that Simon & Schuster 
didn’t want associated with their 
brand. The Constitution does not 
guarantee Americans a right to a 
Twitter account or a book deal. 

Rather than a disagreement over 

policy or values, American political 
discourse 
has 
transcended 
to 

disagreement over fact perpetuated 
by purposeful lies. Republicans 
are telling their voters, and all 
Americans, things that are simply 
not true. 

The most prominent lie is that 

President Joe Biden is not the rightful 
president and that Trump lost due 
to rampant voter fraud, which led 
to an insurrection at the Capitol in 
January and continues to threaten 
our democracy. One solution is to 
prevent the spread of this dangerous 
information 
through 
sources 

that anyone can access, like social 
media sites. These platforms play a 
central role in our daily lives, which 
necessitates their proactivity rather 
than retroactivity.

Twitter was right to ban Trump. 

He has been tweeting falsehoods 

for months, which dramatically 
increased 
in 
number 
and 

destructiveness since the election 
in November — culminating when 
he was removed from Twitter after 
the events in January. But while 
the actions taken by social media 
companies to ban Trump and purge 
other misinformation from their 
sites was the right action to take, it is 
possible that beginning to take serious 
action against misinformation in 2021 
is too little, too late. 

The repercussions of waiting to 

curtail the spread of misinformation 
could have serious consequences all 
over the world. German Chancellor 
Angela Merkel and Russian opposition 
leader Alexey Navalny have both 
expressed concern about free speech 
in the wake of a private company 
banning such a prominent figure 
in world politics. Their arguments 
have merit and demonstrate how 
dangerous it was for tech companies 
to allow misinformation on their 
platforms for such long periods of time 
in the first place. 

There are several actions that 

the government or the companies 
themselves can take to show they 
are trying to prevent lies from being 
spread on these platforms. People 
have called for the tech companies to 
be more transparent in their actions, 
such as setting up a committee 
to make decisions about banning 
users and flagging tweets with clear 
standards that they adhere to.

Why we should give the congressional 

district method a try

I 

have many fond childhood 
memories at my local GameStop, 
a 
tiny 
store 
in 
Somerset 

Collection Mall nestled between a 
candle shop and the public restrooms. 
Back in the days before Twitter and 
Instagram, when Amazon was just a 
bookseller who struggled to compete 
with Borders, I spent my time in a 
magnificent little nerdy paradise 
containing a catalog of video games 
dating back to the 1990s and extending 
up to the newest releases. 

While my sisters and parents 

went around the mall running their 
errands, I was sure to be in the shop 
chatting up the workers or playing the 
demo game set up near the entrance. 
Then, sadly, the Internet boomed, 
brick and mortar stores like this 
became increasingly obsolete, and 
this chain fell in stature alongside so 
many others. 

However, this is only half of this 

story. The other side begins in quite 
possibly the complete opposite of 
metro Detroit — Wall Street. 

Typically, when we think of Wall 

Street, we think of the big institutional 
investors like JPMorgan Chase, 
Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs 
and so on, but these organizations 
are just one piece of the financial 
world. Instead of these traditionally 
beneficial actors, this story focuses 
on the shadowy world of hedge funds.

Hedge funds are kind of like shadow 

banks for uber-wealthy consumers 
who are willing to take on more risks 
in exchange for potentially massive 
rewards, sometimes increasing their 
investments by 40 to 50%. While these 
funds began as somewhat isolated 
and extremely susceptible to market 
fundamentals — like a business’s 
quarterly earnings and the overall 
economic environment — they have 
steadily gained influence over the 
market, transforming into some of the 
most powerful market actors.

One of their many methods 

of exerting this influence is by 
shorting (betting against) struggling 
companies, spreading misinformation 

by manipulating financial media 
and other institutions to send these 
companies into a downward spiral 
while making a tidy profit off their 
bankruptcies. This practice — while 
not necessarily illegal — is deeply 
unethical 
market 
manipulation 

and a symptom of an increasingly 
out-of-control 
marketplace 
fueled 

by cynicism, greed and a lack of 
government regulation.

However, on Jan. 25, the people 

decided to fight back. 

On the subreddit r/WallStreetBets, 

users organized to conduct a mass 
purchase of GameStop (GME) — one 
of the most shorted stocks by hedge 
funds due to its declining stature, 
inflexible business model and poor 
pandemic response — to artificially 
drive the stock price up and deal a 
financial blow to hedge funds.

This plan, however seemingly 

unlikely, succeeded beyond just about 
anyone’s expectations, skyrocketing 
GME’s price over 1,000% over the last 
week and forcing many hedge funds 
to incur massive losses to the tune of 
billions of dollars. These hedge funds, 
in panic mode, accused these retail 
investors of market manipulation, 
which is not entirely unfounded. 

With 
that 
being 
said, 
their 

argument rings hollow as hedge funds 
are the original market manipulators. 
Regulators have shown them leniency. 
Therefore, regulators should show 
leniency to the everyday Americans 
who are fighting back.

Things were looking good for retail 

investors who were finally getting 
one over on the monied interests 
when, on Thursday morning, what 
can be generously described as 
the most collusive action against 
retail investors in the last decade 
was undertaken. Popular trading 
platforms 
like 
Robinhood, 
TD 

Ameritrade and Webull restricted the 
purchasing of GME and other Reddit-
promoted companies. 

This, in turn, sent GME into a state of 

wild fluctuation rising as high as $483 
per share and sinking as low as $112 per 

share within the day. It also sparked 
major controversy online, motivating 
thousands to sign onto a class-action 
lawsuit against Robinhood — whose 
slogan is “democratizing finance for 
all,” despite recently paying $65M 
to settle an investigation into their 
practice of selling users’ information to 
institutional investors. 

The issue united Sen. Ted Cruz, 

R-Texas, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-
Cortez, D-N.Y., Barstool Founder 
Dave Portnoy, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 
D-Mass. and political commentator 
Ben Shapiro while bringing investor 
Leon Cooperman to the verge of tears 
in a truly hilarious video that I cannot 
recommend highly enough. 

So, where does that leave us?
Well, I hate to rain on Reddit’s 

parade, but this is probably not the day 
when we #EatTheRich. However, I 
do believe that this event has finally 
woken the American people — on 
both sides of the aisle — up to how 
corrupt the market can be. 

Between 
the 
Trump 

administration’s 
frenzied 
and 

mostly 
half-baked 
deregulation 

and the real world’s increasing 
disconnection 
from 
the 
stock 

market, something like this was 
bound to happen. Personally, I 
thank God that it wasn’t much 
worse, but that is not to say that this 
story is over. In fact, I think it is just 
beginning. 

I think we are headed for more 

market instability on the immediate 
horizon, and it will not stop until 
our politicians say that enough is 
enough and embolden government 
regulators. Until then, this was a good 
first shot where a down-on-our-luck 
Main Street struck back at a bloated 
and overconfident Wall Street. 

For the hedge funds, the party 

is likely winding down, but for the 
people, Mr. Brightside just began 
playing and you better be sure that 
they can hear the people sing.

What’s happened since the Soleimani assassination?

Where will it end?

Go big or go home

JULIAN BARNARD | COLUMNIST

B

eing 
a 
politician 
is 
a 

dangerous job. Just this 
month we have seen the 

United States Capitol invaded by 
extremists, 
some 
even 
spotted 

carrying zip ties, presumably with 
the intent to kidnap members of 
our government. Some members of 
Congress are taking their safety into 
their own hands. 

For instance, U.S. Rep. Peter 

Meijer, R-Mich., has recently been 
looking to purchase body armor. 
He made this decision out of fear 
for personal safety after he voted to 
impeach former President Donald 
Trump. There are legitimate threats 
to the personal safety of members of 
Congress, and while enhanced U.S. 
Capitol Police presence around all 
members is absolutely necessary, we 
as a country need to decide if that is 
enough. 

Security is like swiss cheese: you 

want to stack as many slices on top 
of each other as possible to cover the 
holes and mitigate risk. In light of the 
present danger, should members of 
Congress keep guns in their homes? 
Yes, and here is why.

If I wrote this article before Jan. 

6, or five years from now, I would 
rightfully be called paranoid for 
making such a sweeping and extreme 
recommendation, but the dangerous 
moment we are living in merits an 
appropriate response. Guns are one 
of the most viscerally divisive issues 
on the modern American political 
landscape, so this piece deserves a 
short primer before we go any further. 
I myself am not a gun fanatic — I don’t 
own a gun, I have never shot a gun and 
I do not fantasize about overthrowing 
a tyrannical government with a 
gun. This piece does not reflect 
any views on background checks, 
mandatory waiting periods, red flag 
laws, restrictions on magazine size 
or restrictions on the types of guns a 
person should be allowed to have. 

All I am trying to say is that if I 

had the opportunity, I would suggest 
that my congresswoman consider 
purchasing a gun for her home — not 
for the House floor or to carry on her 
hip at all times, but for those instances 
where a bodyguard may be too far 
away to prevent a tragedy.

A gun should by no means be the 

first line of defense, but should instead 
fill in the gaps left by a professional 
protective detail. Only the Speaker 
of the House, the House and Senate 
majority and minority leaders and the 
House and Senate whips have full-
time, designated security details. That 
is only nine of 535 voting members 
of Congress who have personal 
protection 24 hours a day. 

Many reading this, across the 

political spectrum, would agree this 
amount of protection is insufficient 
at this moment in history. Personal 
protective details have proven to be 
able to mitigate some risk. Take the 
attack on the Congressional baseball 
game in 2017, for instance. Though 
several congresspeople — including 
House Whip Steve Scalise, R-La. — 
were grievously injured, it would 
have been much worse had Scalise’s 
protective detail not been there, a 
privilege that was only afforded to 
him because he holds a leadership 
position in Congress. 

Imagine you are a member 

of Congress. Imagine you have 
received death threats, have had 
people come to your home, had your 
place of work invaded and had your 
family jeopardized. Imagine that 
the people employed to secure your 
place of work, for whatever reason, 
have not been able to do their jobs 
to a satisfactory standard. Imagine 
— even if you are one of the lucky 
members who has 24-hour security 
— that you hear someone break into 
your home while you sleep. This is 
an uncommon, though very feared, 
scenario for most Americans, but 

is absolutely within the realm of 
possibility for our members of 
Congress in 2021. In the event of this 
nightmare, I want my Representative 
— and future Secretary of the Interior 
— Deb Haaland, D-N.M., to have the 
means to defend herself.

We 
should 
understand 
the 

counterargument to my line of 
thinking: Guns, statistically, don’t 
make people safer. There is a higher 
likelihood of the gun owner or their 
family injuring themselves than 
stopping an attacker. For every one 
fatal use of a gun in self-defense, there 
are two fatal gun accidents. 

However, considering the credible 

threats against the lives and safety 
of our representatives, the calculus 
of safety looks much different for 
politicians than it does for the 
average American. If a member of 
Congress does want to utilize a gun 
for self-defense, the government 
should provide gun safety training 
for the member so that they can most 
effectively keep themselves safe.

Normally, progressives, like me, 

don’t find ourselves agreeing with 
Reps. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., 
Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. or 
Madison Cawthorn, R-N.C. Gun 
rights for members of Congress have 
recently been a Republican talking 
point, with Boebert petitioning to 
bring her Glock onto the floor of the 
House. But let’s think about it — even 
though Republicans are the most 
ardent gun supporters today, who 
would benefit from having a gun in 
their home the most? Democrats such 
as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 
D-N.Y., Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. and 
others are the recipients of the most 
ire from the mob who stormed the 
Capitol earlier this month, but are not 
provided with a 24/7 security detail.

We should of course draw a line at 

what is a reasonable bearing of arms. 
It is not reasonable for members of 
Congress to bring their firearms onto 

the floor of the House and Senate, 
considering the significant security 
measures that have been undertaken 
since the Jan. 6 riot. A gun can be a 
helpful tool, but it should be carried 
judiciously.

One politician who could be 

more amenable to a gun-oriented 
protection plan is Sen. Bernie 
Sanders, I-Vt. Sanders has a record 
of much more moderate gun policies 
than one would expect from the 
well-established progressive. Some 
of his most notable dissents from the 
Democratic Party include his 1993 
vote against a bill that mandated 
background checks for gun sales. 
In more recent years, Sanders has 
altered some of his positions on 
guns, but his dissents still serve as a 
demonstration that moderate views 
about gun control still have a place in 
the landscape of liberal thought.

In conversations about gun control, 

many people — both those in favor of 
gun control like myself, and those 
against it — can lose sight of what 
a gun is. A gun is neither a symbol 
of American hubris and disrespect 
for life nor a permanent protector of 
liberty and the American way. A gun 
is a tool used to accomplish a goal, like 
a jackhammer. 

Usually, a gun isn’t the best tool 

to keep a home safe and will more 
likely hurt someone in an accident 
than stop a legitimate intruder — at 
least that’s the case for the average 
homeowner. Members of Congress 
are in a different situation altogether. 
They are under imminent threat from 
domestic terrorism, so guns pass 
back over the line from dangerous 
ornament to helpful tool. This is 
an atypical policy response from a 
progressive, but it could absolutely 
prevent another tragedy in a chaotic 
epoch.

firearms in a perilous era

henever I sat down for 
my fifth-hour AP United 
States Government and 

Politics class in high school, I would 
brace myself. Here we go, I thought. 
Every day I reminded myself never 
to crack the eggshells I walked on or 
to care too much about the arbitrary 
arguments of my classmates. It’s just a 
high school class, I remembered, and 
you’re here for the grade. 

I recall one class where we had a 

“free day” to debate any subject of our 
choosing. Naturally, as most dramatic 
teenagers do, we selected the topic 
of abortion. Instead of partaking in 
the riveting dissension, I elected to 
illustrate the map of students in the 
order of those that talked. 

“Thank god I don’t have to do 

this,” I whispered to my table mate. 
As I predicted, the civility of the 
discourse lasted all of three minutes.

Leaving class that day, I didn’t 

think much about the dispute. I had 
merely gone through the motions for 
five months and had one hour left 
before school ended. I tended to avoid 
engaging in political issues for fear of 
being ridiculed, arrogant or both. Yet 
I wanted to speak up, to participate 
when the moment was right. Now, a 
year later, I realize that such a time 
rarely comes when it’s convenient. 

Creating these opportunities for 

ourselves to speak up is crucially 
important as they allow us to voice 
our opinions on our current state of 
democracy. Perhaps many of us have 
never been afforded this chance or, 
in a more complex sense, are unsure 
of how to do so. Starting an honest 
conversation is like Goldilocks: It’s 
either too blunt or too subtle, but 
never just right.

Eventually, 
the 
perpetual 

passiveness builds up. We release 
it in small bursts with social media 
posts and retweets, but that usually 
ends up creating more division than 
solidarity. So we push it back down, 
because nobody really cares anyway, 
right? We save our frustrations for a 
bigger fight, a more impactful event 
— such as attacking the U.S. Capitol.

I’ll spare you the details as I’m 

sure you’ve already watched, listened 
and read about it. It’s appalling and 
disgusting no matter the political 
party — or at least it should be. If 
we thought we had hit rock bottom 
before, then now we’re approaching 
some anarchist dystopia that will 
permanently rupture the well-being 
of our country. 

Yet, my dad called me into his 

room and we watched a stunned 
Wolf Blitzer attempt to analyze the 
situation, I wasn’t in total shock. I 
was more or less unfazed, as if this 
was just another level of insanity 
we’ve reached. 

Perhaps 
this 
may 
seem 

cruel or flippant, but it’s hardly 
refutable. Yes, we could be better 
as a country, but right now we 
aren’t. Granted, I never thought it 
would come to what it has. This 
happened on our watch, and we’re 
left to deal with the consequences. 
It may not be about white privilege 
or how horribly some Republicans 
behave. It’s about large-scale 
political repression and how to 
reach its solution. Our feelings 
of anguish have overstayed their 
welcome. 

In these times, I think of the 

character of the U.S. and how, after 
unspeakable tragedies like 9/11, 
the nation bonded and turned its 
newfound unity into resilience. Such 
a healing transformation seems like a 
pipe dream at the moment. 

I also reflect on my U.S. 

government class, where a debate 
that appeared meaningless in the 
big picture actually served as a 
microcosm for our national and 
political polarization. I remember 
looking at the diagram of dialogue 
I had scribbled, a zigged-zagged 
representation of dished out one-
liners and utter chaos.

ast Wednesday at noon, 
Joe Biden and Kamala 
Harris were sworn in as 

the 46th president and the 49th vice 
president, respectively, sparking 
hope for millions of Americans 
who voted for them. However, 
they are faced with no easy task. 
The new administration inherits a 
deeply divided country with one of 
its worst economies since the Great 
Depression, on top of a pandemic that 
has taken the lives of over 400,000 
individuals and a climate crisis already 
wreaking havoc across the country. 
The Biden-Harris administration has 
been given a historic opportunity to 
take advantage of their Democratic 
trifecta and use it to address the 
country’s biggest problems with 
large, sweeping solutions. Biden 
and Democrats must go bold with 
climate change policies or risk 
recreating 
the 
conditions 
that 

allowed for former President Donald 
Trump to rise to power. 

The last time the Democrats 

controlled the Senate, House of 
Representatives and the White 
House was under former President 
Barack Obama’s first two years 
in office from 2009 to 2011. Even 
though Obama was left with a 
deeply struggling economy from 
the 2007-2008 financial crisis, 
his actions as president laid the 
groundwork for Trump to gain 
popularity, specifically in the Rust 
Belt and to eventually win the 2016 
election. Trump was able to win 
roughly 8.4 million voters that voted 
for Obama in 2012, resulting in more 
than 200 counties being flipped. 

This begs the question of why 

this happened. Is it because Obama 
shied away from the big ideas he 
ran on while campaigning? Was 
it a reflection of the overconfident 
campaign that former Democratic 
nominee Hillary Clinton ran? Were 
the economic hardships caused 
by the disastrous trade deals in 

the Midwest too much for the 
Democrats to overcome? 

Placing the blame on one single 

factor is naive and will only start 
needless debate. However, moving 
on without retrospection will 
only lead to repeated mistakes. 
Lessons need to be learned from 
the last Democratic presidential 
administration so that another 
demagogue is not able to make 
it back to 1600 Pennsylvania 
Avenue. 

In addition to reversing Trump’s 

executive orders and trying to 
make inroads while attempting to 
get the COVID-19 pandemic under 
control, Biden has already signed 
30 executive orders in total, with 
two focusing on climate or the 
environment. 

The first of these reentered the 

United States into the Paris climate 
agreement, a long-time promise 
from Biden but a very basic step 
after Trump withdrew the country 

in 2017. The other executive order 
canceled 
construction 
of 
the 

Keystone XL pipeline, which would 
have run from Canada down to 
Texas, marking a huge victory for 
the thousands of Indigenous and 
environmental activists who fought 
the pipeline every step of the way. 

That same order directed federal 

agencies to review and reverse 
more than 100 regulations that the 
Trump administration rolled back 
over four years. Yes, these are good 
and necessary first steps, but there 
is still a long way to go to lessen the 

effects of climate change and the 

first 100 days of Biden’s presidency 
will tell us a lot about how big and 
bold he is willing to go. 

Rejoining the Paris Agreement 

and 
overturning 
Trump’s 

deregulations only brings the country 
back to where it was just four years 
prior. Biden must enact new policies 
to bring us into the future and make 
up for lost time under Trump. 

Biden has announced that he 

plans to roll out more of his climate 
and environmental goals in the 
coming weeks. As of this week, he 
planned on signing a plethora of 
executive orders on Jan. 27. These 
included a “series of regulatory 
actions to combat climate change 
domestically and elevates climate 
change as a national security 
priority,” suggesting that — so far — 
climate change seems to be near the 
top of the current administration’s 
priorities. 

On his campaign website, he 

goes more in-depth about his 
goals. Biden’s major goal is for 
the U.S. to have 100% renewable, 
clean energy by 2050. The steps 
he lays out to get there include 
investing in infrastructure to 
make it resilient to the effects of 
climate change, rallying foreign 
allies to commit to and follow 
through with climate goals and 
the 
“largest-ever” 
investment 

into clean energy research and 
development. On top of that, Biden 
has continuously emphasized that 
his administration will listen to 
“the science.” 

Biden has a real chance to make 

sweeping and bold policy decisions 
that 
will 
drastically 
improve 

millions of lives and give Americans 
and people around the world a 
fighting chance against climate 
change. But will he do it? 

For Biden to become a successful 

president, 
he 
must 
eliminate 

the conditions that facilitated 
the rise of Trump. This means 
substantially bettering the living 
conditions of everyday people and, 
in the process, creating a safer 
and healthier environment for 
everyone. The era of small ideas 
must come to an end — back to 
normal is not an option.

efore a global pandemic, 
racial justice protests and a 
presidential election, 2020 

already had a chaotic start with 
the United States’ assassination of 
Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, 
commander of Iran’s Quds Force, 
on Jan. 3. The assassination spiked 
already high tensions between the 
U.S. and Iran to levels not seen for 
decades, causing many internet users 
to assume the imminent beginning of 
World War III.

Obviously, this did not happen. 

Iran’s only retaliation for the killing 
was to launch missiles at two American 
military bases in Iraq, which caused no 
casualties and seemed almost designed 
not to do so. After that, tensions largely 
declined, with no further military 
action by either side, not even on the 
anniversary last week, when some 
form 
of 
acknowledgement 
was 

expected by many national security 
experts.

However, it would be a mistake to 

claim that this quiet means that the 
two countries are at peace. In fact, 
in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
the ongoing U.S. sanctions campaign 
against Iran became all the more 
cruel and unbefitting of a nation that 
claims to fight for human rights. We 
would do well to end it.

First, a little background on the 

American sanctions program on Iran: 
While the U.S. has leveled sanctions 

against Iran nearly consistently since 
the beginning of the hostage crisis 
in 1979, the most directly relevant 
sanctions to the ones we apply today 
were initially passed as part of the 
Comprehensive 
Iran 
Sanctions, 

Accountability, and Divestment Act 
of 2010. 

These sanctions banned the import 

and export of Iranian goods that were 
more valuable than $100 to the U.S., 
with the exception of some food and 
medicine items. These sanctions were 
passed in order to discourage the 
development of Iran’s nuclear program, 
and were heavily relaxed by the 2015 
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, 
which stipulated that these sanctions 
would be relaxed unless Iran restarted 
its nuclear program. Repealing these 
sanctions had a massive positive effect 
on Iran’s economy and quality of life, 
with its GDP expanding 13.4% in 2016 
and its Human Development Index 
increasing by 0.01, one of the largest 
upward movements that year.

However, with the U.S. exit from 

the JCPOA in 2018, the sanctions that 
the deal relaxed have been put back 
into place. Predictably, in the same 
metrics that proved the increase in 
Iran’s quality of life after the sanctions 
were relaxed, Iran began to decline, 
with GDP decreases of over 6% in both 
2018 and 2019 and its HDI decreasing 
by 0.002 in both years, one of the worst 
for any country in that time.

And now, with the COVID-19 

pandemic, the weight of the sanctions 
has been felt even more heavily in Iran. 
From the beginning, the government’s 
efforts at economic stimulus were 
hampered by the fact that they could 
no longer export oil, denying them 
half of their previous revenues. 
Compounding that, a 2019 Human 
Rights Watch report stated that 
American sanctions have denied Iran 
access to medical supplies, something 
that became an exponentially greater 
issue in a pandemic. 

Finally, Iran was forced to reopen 

in May, which was earlier than was 
medically advisable, because its 
economy had been so weakened by 
sanctions that it could not remain 
locked down. It is not a great leap of 
logic to suggest that these sanctions 
and their effects are at least a 
contributing factor to Iran having 
one of the highest per capita COVID-
19 death rates in the world. In light 
of this, as well as allegations that 
re-imposing the sanctions in the first 
place violated the JCPOA, the United 
Nations Security Council voted in a 
13-2 vote to proclaim that the U.S. had 
no right to impose the sanctions.
All of this, however, leaves many 
defenders of the sanctions undeterred. 
Former U.S. Secretary of State 
Mike Pompeo defends keeping the 
sanctions, stating how, “We have done 
remarkable work to deny the regime 

the resources they need to continue 
to carry out their terror campaign.” 
A Wall Street Journal editorial from 
March states that there is no reason 
to end the sanctions because, “The 
regime is responsible for the people’s 
suffering.” 

However, 
neither 
of 
these 

arguments actually hold up to 
greater 
scrutiny. 
The 
Iranian 

backed paramilitaries of Hezbollah 
and the al Houthis both remained 
active in 2020 despite the sanctions, 
not that blocking either one was ever 
a great reason to starve a country 
of medical supplies and crash its 
economy. Additionally, while no one 
can say that the Iranian government 
handled the pandemic well, it is 
ridiculous to suggest that removing 

their biggest sources of revenue and 
obstructing their access to basic 
medical equipment had nothing to 
do with their failure.

How spring break diet culture enables disordered eating

M

y favorite book begins 
by painting a vivid im-
age of frozen, foggy 

city streets, and as piercing gusts of 
wind push the temperature outside 
my window into the single-digits, I 
can’t help but put forth my version 
of the same: it is damn cold outside. 
It was damn cold yesterday, it will be 
damn cold tomorrow and it is going 
to be damn cold for the foreseeable 
future.

Bleak is certainly the word that 

seems most fitting. 

It is the frigid heart of Michigan 

winter, and when every day is this 
gray and this gloomy, who among us 
can be blamed for wanting to escape 
to sunny sands and warm beaches?

Spring break trips seem to be the 

solution. Group spring break trips 
targeted specifically towards college 
students (and especially towards stu-
dents who participate in Greek life) 
market themselves as an opportunity 
to do just that. Companies such as 
JusCollege and EF Ultimate Break of-
fer trips that they say are the ultimate 
college travel experience: a picture-
perfect spring break, with nothing to 
coordinate — just sign up, and you and 
your friends are all set to head off to 
places like Miami, Puerto Vallarta or 
Cabo San Lucas.

These trips are marketed specifi-

cally to college students as an oppor-
tunity to go on spring break with ev-
eryone they know — not just one or 
two friend groups, but entire social 
circles, entire organizations; not just 
ten or even twenty people, but hun-
dreds of people. 

It may sound like the ideal setup, 

but it’s also a daunting situation to 
walk into.

I know it would be for me. 
I remember the first time I felt self-

conscious about my body. It was the 
end of fifth grade, and my elementary 
school was throwing the graduating 
class the annual pool party. I knew I 
couldn’t wear the Speedos I wore to 
swim practice, so my mom and I went 
bathing suit shopping at Gap Kids, and 
I came home with a purple-and-teal-
striped bikini and a yellow one-piece 
with sunflowers on it — that way I 
could have options, my mom said. 

In the store, I really could have 

gone either way about which suit to 
wear to the pool party. But I got home 
and started to worry about which one 
to wear. I ended up going with the 
one-piece. I told my mom it was be-
cause I was too pale for the bikini, and 
that I’d have to work on my tan before 
I could wear it around my friends.

That wasn’t the truth.
The truth was that, at 11 years old, 

I was already self-conscious about the 
way my body would look in a bikini. 
And that was just my fifth-grade pool 

party — I can count on one hand the 
people who were there that I’m still 
close to. 

But hitting the beach in roughly the 

same amount of fabric as that yellow 
one-piece on this side of the growth 
spurt? With everyone I know at this 
university — the guy I like, the girls I 
hope will be friends for life and every-
one they know here, too — looking at 
me? 

As my fifth-grade self would have 

put it, you’d have an easier time teach-
ing London Tipton how to drive. The 
PRNDL? Sure, no problem. But a 
beach filled with people whose valida-
tion I want so, so badly? Excuse me, I’m 
just going to look for Miley Cyrus in 
this room that Hannah Montana is in. 

I knew I wasn’t alone in this senti-

ment. I spoke about these types of ex-
periences via Zoom with several wom-
en who went on spring break trips 
similar to those aforementioned. The 
women’s names have been changed 
(denoted with asterisks) to protect 
their anonymity in order to allow them 
to speak about this sensitive issue free-
ly. 

I spoke with Heather, an LSA senior 

who went on group spring break trips 
to Miami and Cabo her freshman and 
sophomore years, about her experi-
ence. 

“It was a lot — being around every-

one we knew for those four days in just 
a bikini,” Heather said. “Then there’s 
the fact that it was going to be remem-
bered for so long because of the pic-
tures, and because people judge you on 
how you look. Looking back, it was so 
stupid, but it was such a thing.”

Lisa*, another LSA senior, also 

experienced the social pressure that 
these spring break trips can create, 
saying that it can be easy to fall into 
self-comparison with everyone else 
on the trip.

“It was intimidating knowing that 

we were spending four days in this 
environment,” she said. “Being at the 
darties (day parties), and being by the 
pool, knowing that there were gonna 
be girls who were gonna be so skinny, 
and then me — I wasn’t comfortable 
taking my sarong off. It was just an in-
timidating atmosphere, knowing that 
we would be in bikinis for five days 
straight.”

But spring break isn’t supposed to 

be intimidating; it’s supposed to be 
fun. More specifically, it’s supposed 
to be the “time of your life,” and when 
real life isn’t matching up to that per-
fect picture, it’s incredibly anxiety-
inducing. 

Advertisements like this one end 

up perpetuating that sort of stress, 
presenting these spring break trips 
as a chance to have the best time ever 
— a chance, in other words, to “peak.” 
With entire social circles on one trip, 
by one pool, at one party, spring break 
can become an opportunity to take 
control of your social life. The trip 
provides opportunities that a stan-
dard house party or tailgate might not. 

Studies show that a desire for con-

trol can play a major role in the de-
velopment of eating disorders. And 
when spring break seems more and 
more like the perfect opportunity to 
take control of your social life, com-
bined with a somewhat universal feel-
ing of social pressure, maybe it should 
be less surprising that many women 
develop disordered eating habits in 
the weeks leading up to the trip. 

Kendrin Sonneville, a professor 

in the University of Michigan School 
of Public Health, explained this phe-
nomenon in a Zoom call with me.

“The college years are a time of ep-

idemiologic vulnerability — that is, it’s 
a time where people are more likely to 
experience onset of disordered eating 
or full-syndrome eating disorders,” 
Sonneville said. “People who are al-
ready worried about how they look, or 
people who are already intending to 
do a spring break trip, they’re going to 
see those images (in advertisements) 
and think, ‘Oh gosh I really have to 
take my weight and shape control ac-
tivities more seriously, I have to up the 
ante, I have to be more extreme.’”

It’s important to note that disor-

dered eating is not the same as an 
eating disorder. Disordered eating 
behaviors are defined by the National 
Institutes of Health as eating patterns 
that are abnormal, but not to the ex-
tent that would warrant diagnosis of 
a full-syndrome eating disorder. Ex-
amples of these habits include use of 
diet pills, skipping or limiting meals, 
fasting and self-induced vomiting. In 
other words, these can be symptoms 
of eating disorders but at a lower fre-
quency. Disordered eating can also es-
calate into a full-syndrome disorder, 
according to the NIH. 

These disordered eating behaviors 

can become common in the build-up 
to the spring break trip itself, Lisa says. 

“I started eating really healthy, like 

for lunch I would just have some tuna 
and some cucumbers and when we 
went out, we would binge, because we 
were so hungry and we had starved 
ourselves all day,” said Lisa. “Hor-
ribly, the week before (sophomore 
spring break), I got this laxative tea 
and drank that and took a laxative. I’d 
never taken a laxative before, but I just 
wanted to look good, and that was my 
experience. Constantly, it was some-
thing I was thinking about.”

The group nature of the trips can 

also be a factor in both initiating and 
perpetuating these behaviors. Many 
of the women’s friend groups live to-
gether and eat together, so peer pres-
sure becomes palpable, said Heather.

“Living with other girls who were 

all going through the same thing, it 
was a constant, constant conversa-
tion,” she said. “It just leads to a really 
toxic environment, because if you see 
other people only eating salads, and 
you want to have a burger or pasta or 
something, you think it’s wrong. So 
even if it was just a couple people who 
were really vocal about it, everyone’s 
actions spoke loudly.”

Some groups even go beyond just 

that atmospheric pressure and com-
mit to losing the weight together. It 
can create a sense of group account-
ability that can be very persistent, 
Traci Carson, who finished her Doc-
torate in Epidemiology through the 
Public Health School last year with 
a research focus on eating disorders, 
told me over Zoom. The constant 
conversation around body image 
only adds to this, she says.

“The group thing can kick in, of 

‘We’re all gonna do this together and 
hold each other accountable,’” Car-
son said. “So much of our culture re-

volves around talking about our bod-
ies and talking about other people’s 
bodies and making comments about 
other people’s bodies, especially in 
college.”

Carso also stressed that seemingly 

innocuous or complimentary com-
ments on social media, which often 
becomes flooded with spring break 
photos once classes get out, can en-
courage women who are already 
engaging in harmful eating habits to 
continue on that pathway.

“You see it all the time,” Carson 

said. “A woman will post a photo of 
herself and the comments section will 
be almost like making fun of her how 
small she is or how skinny she is in a 
way that’s intended to boost her ego 
and intended to make her feel good. 
But if that woman is struggling or on 
the verge of struggling with restric-
tive eating and eating disorders, it can 
just reinforce that she’s doing the right 
thing and exacerbate those behaviors 
because she’s getting those positive 
feedback.” 

Because of this reinforcement, 

comments such as “omg FIRE”, “in-
sane” and “so hot” can lead to a nasty 
cycle of more and more dieting and 
eating restriction in pursuit of those 
compliments.

“Those comments are so harm-

ful, and could end up contributing to 
a very long period of getting stuck in 
these patterns of restrictive eating and 
loving that positive reinforcement,” 
said Carson. 

The self-comparison facilitated by 

social media can also lead women to-
wards more restrictive eating behav-
iors. Hayley Friedman, an LSA junior 
in recovery from anorexia nervosa, 
spoke to me about this very concept 
over Zoom. The availability of smiling, 
dancing images of perceived cooler 
girls having the time of their lives on 
similar trips, just a few clicks away — 
they’re too easy to find and too easy to 
compare yourself to.

“That was something that I strug-

gled with for a really long time,” Fried-
man said. “I would constantly see 
pretty, skinny girls … and I remember 
especially in high school taking pic-
tures with friends or even just seeing 
pictures on social media, and just be-
ing like ‘Oh my gosh I wish I looked 
like that’ or ‘How did she do that’ or 
‘Whoa, those abs.’”

Most people know that social me-

dia posts are usually heavily edited 
and filtered, and that the people in 
the photos are often sucking in, flex-
ing and posing the exact right way in 
order for their body to appear more 
ideal for the photo. Still, though, as 
these techniques become increasingly 
subtle and convincing, it can be hard-
er and harder to separate these imag-
es from reality, Friedman explained.

“That was definitely a really big 

struggle for me — sometimes it even 
still is,” Friedman said. “I’ll see a photo 
— especially bathing suit pictures feel 
like the be-all, end all, and it makes 
it really difficult to see someone’s 
picture-perfect photograph of them 
posed in the exact right position, 
flexing, whatever it may be, and then 
you’re like ‘Oh my gosh, they look like 
that always, and I don’t look like that.’ 
There’s such a disconnect.” 

But even knowing that the discon-

nect is there doesn’t actually help that 
much, because someway or another, 
that girl you always stalk on Insta-
gram managed to make herself look 
like that in that photo, and no matter 
how much you remind yourself it’s 
not real, the fact is that it feels real. 

At least, it does to me.

I’ll see the photos, and I’ll wonder 

what my life would be like if my legs 
were that long, if my abs looked like 
hers, if I could get my hair to do that. 
And spring break is when I feel it the 
most, because my friends are really 
pretty, okay, and it’s the one week of 
the year when many are posting those 
photos at the same time.

The environment that spring break 

can create on social media around 
these trips can increase the pressure 
to look a certain way, especially in pic-
tures, said Sandy*, a Music & Theatre 
senior over Zoom. Sandy went on two 
group trips, one sophomore year and 
one junior year, during her time at 
school. 

“We all compare ourselves to each 

other when we see those pictures,” 
Sandy said. “I knew people who were 
like, ‘We need to work out every day 
so we can post pictures and look 
good,’ and I knew she was comparing 
herself to other people.” 

All of these factors combined — the 

trip “everyone’s” going on, the photos 
“everyone’s” going to be posting, the 
opportunity to take control of the so-
cial situation — essentially create a 
pressure-cooker in the weeks leading 
up to the trip. As the departure date 
gets closer, the temperature inches 
ever-higher and girls start to turn to 
increasingly harmful measures to 
achieve their “body goals,” Lisa said.

It involves a lot of workouts — “A 

lot of girls, including myself, we got 
Ross gym memberships, and you’d 
go every day and see everyone there,” 
Lisa explained — and not a lot of calo-
ries. 

Heather recalls seeing friends re-

place everything possible with lim-
ited “healthier” options. Pancakes and 
French toast at brunch are replaced 
with fruit and yogurt. Pasta and tacos 
are replaced by salads at the dinner 
table. At pregames for parties, lem-
onade and fruit punch chasers are re-
placed with lime wedges. Late-night 
cheesy bread from Pizza House and 
wings from Mr. Spot’s are replaced 
with carrots and celery. 

And as things get more intense, she 

said, even those “healthier” options 
get replaced by nothing at all. 

But these changes in diet actually 

result in the opposite of their desired 
effect, Dr. Terrill Bravender, the chief 
of adolescent medicine and director of 
the eating disorder center at C.S. Mott 
Children’s Hospital, said over Zoom.

“The first thing is that your body 

responds by going into what we think 
of as starvation mode, meaning it 
starts to metabolize itself,” Bravender 
explained. “The first step in doing 
that, physiologically, is not to burn fat, 
it’s actually to burn protein, and so if 
we go for a prolonged period without 
taking any external nutrition in, the 
first reaction of our body is that we 
metabolize our muscles. That’s not 
exactly the intention that most people 
have when they go on a crash diet.”

If the dieting continues, it can cause 

a wide variety of issues, Bravender said. 
These can include slowed brain func-
tion, decreased heart rate and blood 
pressure, weakened cardiovascular 
health, a range of gastrointestinal is-
sues and lower immune system func-
tioning. Additionally, people who are 
underweight have quicker and stron-
ger reactions to alcohol and can expe-
rience dizziness, nausea and fainting, 
especially in warm, and/or crowded 
situations — instances which are com-
mon occurrences during spring break.

I 

have two particu-
larly 
incessant 

roommates. They 

destroy my study spaces, 
knocking my notebook to 
the floor while I’m pre-
occupied on Zoom. They 
perform perilous park-
our atop kitchen cabi-
nets, bed frames and any 
other obstacle around the 
apartment they manage 
to summit. They scream 
for hours until I prepare 
their meals and, when it’s 
finally time, they devour 
them without thanks. It 
doesn’t seem that curi-
osity can kill my beloved 
cats, Socks and Salem, 
but their curiosity may 
just kill me.

All 
jokes 
aside, 
I 

wouldn’t trade my cats 
for the world. I’ve had 
them for about a year and 
a half. When they were 
adopted in July 2019, I 
couldn’t 
have 
guessed 

what was in store for 
our future. I couldn’t 
have 
known 
the 
sol-

ace that their curiosity 
would bring these past 
few months. No mat-
ter how monotonous the 
days would become, me 
waking each morning to 
a world unchanged and 
unexciting, 
Socks 
and 

Salem never saw it that 
way. They instead greet 
each day as a new adven-
ture, always able to find 
some aspect of life still 
ripe for exploration.

Most 
interestingly, 

though, 
is 
that 
amid 

these 
perpetual 
esca-

pades, Socks and Salem 
have also mastered the 
art of serenity. Whether 
atop my lap or tucked 
into some fleece-lined 
crevice, those two are ex-
perts at R&R. And so they 
spend their days cycling 
through phases of inves-
tigation and relaxation, 
defying the old adage 
which claims that curios-
ity will be their downfall. 
Instead, curiosity is what 
sustains them.

Take This 
As Your 
Warning

W

atching my two 
favorite boys go 

about life as usual over 
these past few months 
made me wonder why we 
as a society ever decided 
that curiosity would kill 
the cat. When I looked it 
up, it turned out that the 
idiom has a curious his-
tory of its own. In fact, 
centuries before “curi-
osity killed the cat” was 
popularized as an Irish 
proverb in the late 1800s, 
its wisdom took on a dif-
ferent meaning.

The phrase’s first writ-

ten account dates back 
to Ben Johnson’s 1598 
play, “Every Man and His 
Humor,” in which “cu-
riosity” is swapped for 
“care.” 
Johnson’s 
play 

was written as a satire. 
Each of the main char-
acters 
suffered 
some 

form of obsession, which 
drove the entire story’s 
conflict. Care, otherwise 
conceived of as worry or 
obsession, was theorized 
to push a person — or cat 
— to insanity.

This 
message 
rang 

true with other cultural 
contributors of the era, 
including William Shake-
speare. Just a year after 
performing in the troupe 
of Johnson’s play, Shake-
speare injected the wis-
dom into his own works 
as a line in “Much Ado 
About Nothing.” “What, 
courage man!” he wrote. 
“What though care killed 
a cat, thou hast mettle 
enough in thee to kill 
care.”

Both 
Johnson 
and 

Shakespeare 
described 

this overzealous “care” 
as a grave transgression 
which hurts not only 
yourself, but the people 
around you as well. But 
despite the rephrasing, 
my 
original 
grievance 

still holds. “Care killed 
the cat” just doesn’t align 
with the behavior I see 
in Socks and Salem. Cats 
are by nature aloof and 
nonchalant. 
It’s 
clear 

that the saying is not 
meant to be advice for 
them; instead, it reflects 
a piece of advice meant 
to be heard by us.

It’s difficult to dis-

tinguish the exact point 
where language breaks 
from culture. We weave 
our histories, our pas-
sions and our insecurities 

into the way we speak — 
both as individuals and 
communities. 
For 
this 

reason, each idiom can 
be used as a case study 
that cues into a deeper 
look of culture. Often re-
peated shards of wisdom 
provide insight into the 
evolving values of our so-
ciety.

This begs the ques-

tion: Why did colloquial 
culpability for the cat’s 
demise shift from care to 
curiosity over the years? 
Linguistic historians are 
unsure of exactly how 
the phrase evolved from 
a warning against obses-
sion to one against ex-
ploration, but in both 
instances, the message is 
clear: Stay in your lane, 
and don’t take on others’ 
problems as your own. 
You could make the ar-
gument that curiosity is 
just a more specific form 
of worry. That is, to be 
curious is to worry about 
what you do not yet know.

Nevertheless, I feel I 

must push back against 
the notion that compas-
sion and inquisition are 
inherently negative acts. 
In this moment where 
there’s little more to do 
than to bide your time, 
a rejection of care and 
curiosity would itself be 
lethal. Without my rela-
tionships or my ability to 
learn new things, I would 
have slipped into a cata-
tonic state months ago.

Just like with my cats, 

it 
seems 
these 
“fatal 

flaws” of empathy and 
inquiry are actually our 
lifeblood. And I’m defi-
nitely not the only one to 
notice, because the evo-
lution of the phrase re-
flects a change of heart. 
Eventually, a refrain was 
tacked onto the idiom 
which fundamentally al-
tered its meaning — “cu-
riosity killed the cat, but 
satisfaction brought it 
back.”

Save The 

Cat

T

he 
Greek 
word 

paraprosdokian, 

literally 
translating 
to 

“beyond expectation,” is 
used to describe a phrase 
in which the final por-
tion reveals a bit of infor-
mation which reframes 
the phrase at large. Oth-
erwise known as a gar-
den path sentence, para-
prosdokians are popular 
forms of humor and in-
trigue. 
The 
rejoinder 

regarding 
satisfaction 

turned “curiosity killed 
the cat” into one of the 
best 
known 
parapros-

dokians of our age.

Now, instead of it be-

ing a warning against 
“care” or “curiosity,” the 
sentiment 
urges 
these 

pursuits, predicting that 
one day any damage done 
will be healed through 
“satisfaction.” 
Sure, 

there may be rifts in rela-
tionships or dead ends in 
research, but there will 

also be fulfilling anniver-
saries and inspiring bits 
of knowledge that make 
the tribulations worth-
while. Still, based on my 
own observation of Socks 
and Salem, I really don’t 
think they’re all that 
pragmatic in their curi-
ous antics. They don’t 
seek out “satisfaction.” 
That’s a human desire.

Like I said before, this 

wisdom wasn’t meant for 
them. It’s meant for us. 
So why choose cats as the 
metaphorical vehicle? 

My hypothesis is that 

it has to do with cats’ 
rumored 
reservoir 
of 

extra lives at their dis-
posal. 
Particularly 
in 

light of the “satisfaction” 
supplement, 
it’s 
clear 

that the saying plays on 
the notion of redemp-
tion which requires that 
lives be easily lost and 
revived. That’s not really 
something that happens 
to humans, besides in re-
ligious or supernatural 
theories. 
Conveniently, 

though, there is an an-
cient tradition suggest-
ing it may happen to cats.

In Egyptian mythol-

ogy, the sun god Atum-
Ra was said to have 
journeyed often to the 
underworld disguised as 
a cat. Atum-Ra gave life 
to eight other gods, and 
the theology took this to 
mean that she was re-
sponsible for nine lives — 
her own included. Over 
time, the mythology was 
passed through a number 
of other cultures, com-
bined with other lived 
experiences 
and 
con-

densed into a simple leg-
end: Cats have nine lives. 
Certainly, 
they 
could 

spare just one to teach us 
a valuable lesson.

Personally, 
I 
don’t 

think that lesson should 
be “suffer until you’re 
satisfied.” 
That’s 
not 

what my cats have taught 
me. As they frolic about 
the 800 square feet at 
their disposal, they aren’t 
denying themselves sat-
isfaction. They are satis-
fied through their curi-
osity. They manifest their 
own happiness, enjoying 
life as they live it.

Sometimes I find my-

self on the periphery of 
their 
mischief. 
Salem 

will beckon me over with 
yearning meows, begging 
me to bear witness as 
he repeatedly headbutts 
the doorpost. Socks will 
scurry hastily around the 
room, sprinting across 
my chest with such fe-
rocity that for a moment, 
I lose my breath. It’s an-
noying, but I’ve lately 
been trying to appreciate 
it more. 

It’s easy to find your 

own satisfaction, if only 
you know where to look. 
And I’m incredibly lucky 
to have two curious cats 
who are always willing 
to share their adventures 
with me.

Curiosity won’t kill you 

just ask my cats

F

or most of my life, my 
brother Noah’s bedroom 
has been connected to 

mine. He cannot access the rest of 
the house without walking through 
my bedroom each morning. I have 
had the comforting privilege of 
reading Noah bedtime stories and 
hugging him goodnight a mere 10 
steps from my own bed. 

And every single morning, Noah 

would quietly creak open my door, 
walk into my room in his old-fun-
draiser-t-shirts-turned-pajamas, 
stare at himself in my wall mirror 
and swiftly exit into the hallway to 
start his day. What I could have eas-
ily dismissed as an early morning 
annoyance became an experience I 
looked forward to with each wake 
up. 

Thanks to our intimate setup, 

almost every day of my adolescent 
life began with a reminder of Noah’s 
beautiful, unique magic. His quick 
“walk through and weirdly stare at 
himself” routine was the kindest 
personalized alarm clock I could ask 
for. Even if it was just for a moment 
before I collapsed back into my pil-
low until it was almost too late for 
lunchtime, his warm smile and in-
nocent curiosity pleasantly kicked 
off even the most dreadful of days. 

However, it was not only at the 

break of dawn that Noah’s wonder-
ful and compassionate demeanor 
made me open my eyes, put on my 
glasses and truly wake up. 

Noah’s autism has paved the way 

for some of the most unusual, heart-
wrenching and glorious memories 
of my life. Many of the moments 
that have shaped who I am were a 
product of his chaotic and beauti-
ful personality. He has thrown my 
grandparent’s old books into nearby 
lakes, resulting in a chaotic yet en-
tertaining family-wide effort to fish 
them out with string and a bucket. 
He has been held back by my strug-
gling parents while I quietly cried 
as he attempted to jump onto train 
tracks during a meltdown out of 
desperation for his beloved train to 
arrive sooner. He has sung his own 
rendition of “You Are My Sunshine” 
for everyone at his sleepaway camp 
at their last night campfire. He has 
been hugged and kissed by fam-
ily members who love him end-
lessly and educated by teachers who 
would do anything to simply help 
him write his name. 

The combination of Noah’s love-

able, engaging character and my 
immense compassion for him has 
made the empathetic understand-
ing of those different from me a cen-
tral part of my identity. Our bond 
has made his metaphorical wake 
up calls begging me to be kind and 
actively voice my experiences ring 
even louder. 

The first time I recall encounter-

ing offensive disability language — 
language utilized either consciously 
or subconsciously to dehumanize 
and/or disrespect those with dis-
abilities — was as a freshman in my 
high school’s harrowing halls. Class-
mates I had barely spoken to would 
casually call a friend “retarded” or 
“sped” (shorthand for “special edu-
cation”) for simple actions such as 
dropping a textbook or spilling wa-
ter. Hearing these conversations left 
an anger in my chest that lingered 
with me. I couldn’t articulate it at 
the time, but something about twist-
ing words once reserved for people 
like Noah into casual insults tied my 
stomach in a knot. 

As I grew older and noticed these 

occurrences more frequently in my 

everyday life, I began to understand 
why these specific words deeply 
frustrated and disappointed me. 
Around junior year of high school, 
I googled the history of the word 
“retarded” in an attempt to under-
stand why and how this form of 
hate speech has become so normal-
ized. Unsurprisingly, my discoveries 
validated every concern I have ever 
had about the word’s harmful impli-
cations. 

What was once a neutral medi-

cal term for intellectual disabilities 
has been transformed into slang 
through the popularization of the 
term as a synonym for “unintelli-
gent” or “thoughtless.” The term’s 

original definition existed to vague-
ly diagnose those with developmen-
tal and/or intellectual disabilities 
in a time before more extensive re-
search on different disorders had 
been done. Due to the widespread 
use of the word in casual contexts, 
“retarded” was subsequently con-
demned as inappropriate within the 
professional community. Through 
efforts from the disabled commu-
nity and their allies, the word was 
legally barred from use in politi-
cal and professional proceedings. 
Through the creation of Rosa’s Law, 
former President Barack Obama 
approved legislation that “mentally 
retarded” was to be removed from 
all federal documents and replaced 
with the more respectful term of 
“intellectual disability.” The law 
was passed and made possible by 
efforts from former Sen. Barbara 
Mikulski, D-Md., and the family of 
Rosa Marcellino, a nine-year-old 
girl with Down Syndrome, and their 
supporters. 

And that should have been the 

end of it. 

Rosa’s Law should have set the 

societal precedent that “retarded” 
and its counterparts had become 
so ridden with problematic under-
tones that it was time to move past 

their use. The public should have 
paid attention to the desires of the 
disabled community and respected 
their wishes. It should have been 
an easy decision to abandon speech 
that disrespectfully referenced a 
relatively large community. But this 
proved to be difficult for a society 
that struggles to listen to marginal-
ized voices and often does not ac-
tively pay attention to the cultural 
contexts behind word choices.

Instead of listening to the voices 

of the disabled and carefully adopt-
ing a more respectful vocabulary, 
“retarded” was fully transformed 
into the twisted evil twin of its origi-
nal interpretation’s intention. 

To gain both an educational 

and personal perspective on these 
linguistic issues, I spoke to Remi 
Yergeau, a University of Michigan 
associate professor of English and 
Digital Studies. Yergeau specializes 
in disability studies and is on the 
autism spectrum themselves. They 
discussed the reality of this harm-
ful rhetoric and the ways in which 
these words reflect our societal and 
cultural values.

“The harm is very real,” Yergeau 

said. “Those terms are denigrating. 
They really serve no other purpose 
than to denigrate. But then they also 
communicate very strongly what 
the culture at large views as human-
ness, basically, because they are de-
humanizing terms.” 

Furthermore, Yergeau empha-

sized the offensive societal impli-
cations of these words in that they 
subconsciously favor a neurotypical 
standard of intelligence. This notion 
therefore criticizes and mocks the 
disabled community for neurologi-
cal and social differences that are 
out of their control. 

“They also represent really stock 

and horrifying notions of intelli-
gence, or they value like this able 
bodied, neuro-typical form of intel-
ligence as if that’s the pinnacle to 

which people need to reach their 
achievements,” Yergeau said. “It de-
values the human dignity and worth 
of people with disabilities”.

The ableist connotations of of-

fensive disability language make 
disassociating their historical and 
current usage virtually impossible. 
The history behind “retarded” and 
its similar insulting counterparts 
cause them to be much more than 
just words. Because of their origins 
as legitimate medical terms, their 
association with intellectual dis-
abilities appears to be somewhat 
indestructible. And when we recog-
nize inevitable complexity, the goal 
shifts: Rather than waste our time 

attempting to justify adjustable lin-
guistic habits, we need to actively 
educate ourselves and each other on 
the damaging impact of our diction 
and how we can be more inclusive 
of frequently silenced communities 
in our language choices.

Unfortunately, we know this is 

easier said than done. Not everyone 
is willing to welcome corrections to 
their speech with open arms. Those 
stuck in their ways seem to eternally 
loop back to their desire to remain 
uncensored, and it can feel like an 
endless losing battle with the public 
at large. 

Grappling with this issue has 

proven to require long term social 
change and cannot be completely 
eradicated by a singular law or 
voice. Society’s deep-seated resis-
tance to diverging from neurotypi-
cal standards, as shown in our ob-
session with offensive slang, allows 
offensive language to persevere 
through generations. I continue to 
see countless friends, significant 
others and even family members 
use “retarded,” “autistic” (in a dis-
tinctly slang context) and “sped” in 
their everyday language.

And maybe on the surface, I 

somewhat understand them. It’s 
human nature to seek indepen-

dence and reject unwanted restric-
tions. Moreover, people who may 
crave immediately rewarding be-
havioral changes can struggle with 
understanding the long term effects 
of their language. Upon my recent 
discovery that common terms such 
as “dumb”, “stupid” and “idiot” 
have problematic ties to disability 
oppression similar to “retarded,” I 
am embarrassed to say that my im-
mediate instinct was to justify my 
previous usage with any argument I 
could devise. But thinking of Noah’s 
kind voice reminded me once more 
to improve my actions rather than 
defend them to protect my pride — 
especially when its impact hurts a 
community in a way I will never be 
able to fully understand myself. 

Regardless of my lack of first-

hand experience with intellectual 
disabilities, I do my best to force 
myself out of my comfort zone and 
confront friends, family and even 
strangers about their language use 
in front of me. I have asked people 
ranging from coworkers to friends to 
a random girl in my dorm’s commu-
nal bathroom to refrain from using 
“retarded” or “autistic” to describe 
someone who is or something that 
is medically neither of those things. 
It’s terrifying to put myself out there 
regarding such a controversial sub-
ject, but my experiences with Noah 
remind me that this will always be a 
worthy fight. 

To dive deeper into the topic 

and hear from a more first-hand 
perspective, I had the privilege of 
speaking to Best Buddies member 
Anne Moler, who has a speech pro-
cessing disorder. Best Buddies is a 
nonprofit organization dedicated to 
creating meaningful relationships 
between those with and without 
intellectual and developmental dis-
abilities. 

As someone with a disability her-

self, Moler vulnerably reflected on 
her experiences with hearing offen-
sive disability language in her daily 
life. 

“It makes me have thoughts in 

my head about myself thinking I’m 
stupid and dumb, and I know that’s 
not true,” she told me. “I know that 
everyone with disabilities did not ask 
for these disabilities. They just were 
born with them or got them later in 
life and we want to be treated like 
everyone else wants to be treated. All 
we want is inclusion and respect.”

LSA sophomore Lydia Goff, Best 

Buddies treasurer, shared her expe-
rience with me as both an ally for the 
disabled community and an active 
force in promoting inclusion at the 
University. She emphasized the im-
perative role of highlighting disabled 
voices as much as possible. 

“It’s so important that we elevate 

the voices of people with disabilities 
because it’s not about being a voice 
for the voiceless,” she said. “It’s about 
who has the microphone.”

In order to truly become aware of 

the concerns surrounding disability 
language, we need to elevate disabled 
voices themselves. It is the people 
like Yergeau, Moler and Noah who 
we need to be listening to. It is the 
people who have experienced what I 
never have that can wake us up and 
guide us on the path to a more equi-
table and inclusive society. 

It is time for us to act as if we each 

have a Noah of our own coming into 
our rooms each morning. It is time 
for us to act as if each of us have a 
personal vexation for the offensive 
contexts in which our words are 
used. 

It is time to wake up.

Wake up and 
smell the rhetoric

“

What? That’s it? I want 
more!” I thought to 
myself as I finished 

the last episode of the new 
Netflix hit, “Bridgerton.” Net-
flix’s 
most-watched 
series 

ever revolves around the eight 
close-knit Bridgerton siblings. 
Viewers get to know these 
characters as they look for 
love during London’s high so-
ciety “season,” an annual time 
when elite families would host 
formal events to introduce 
their children to society and 
find them a suitable marriage. 

Eight episodes of pure fan-

tasy. I binge-watched episode 
after episode and dreamt of 
being a part of high society 
London. 
“How 
fantastical,” 

I thought, wearing one-of-
a-kind, 
uniquely 
beautiful 

dresses designed specially for 
you, attending balls, dancing 
with the hopes of finding a 
husband. And if you’re lucky 
enough, like the main char-
acter Daphne, you’ll stumble 
into a marriage with a hus-
band you actually love. Then 
there is the morning after the 
ball, which was another social 
gathering in itself. The spec-
tacle consisted of sitting in 
another elegant dress, drink-
ing tea and having pastries 
with the expectation that po-
tential partners bearing gifts 
and conversation would walk 

through the doors in an at-
tempt to charm the woman 
they were after. 

I couldn’t stop talking about 

the show with any friends 
of mine who had watched it. 
Maybe it was because I don’t 
watch much television oth-
er than the occasional “That 
‘70s Show,” or maybe it was 
because I was so bored over 
winter break that I didn’t re-
ally have much else to talk 
about. Either way, I realized I 
was not alone in my obsession 
— “Bridgerton’’ had taken the 
internet by storm. Whenever I 
opened Instagram or Twitter, 
the memes, videos or tweets 
shared a common theme: a 
desire to be a part of the phe-
nomenon. My friends even 
sent me TikToks with millions 
of views of women simply ob-
sessing over the fashion, balls 
and sex displayed on screen. 
Viewers ate up the allure of 
English high society — dress 
in elegant ball gowns, have tea 
and find a Prince or a Duke as 
a husband. 

The overwhelming desire to 

have a relationship of the kind 
depicted throughout the se-
ries and the glamorization of 
beauty so prevalent through-
out the show seemed to domi-
nate social media and the texts 
I received.

However, after days and 

weeks of giving into my infat-
uation, I decided to take a step 
back. I started questioning 
what exactly was so fantasti-
cal about the series and what 
provoked my envy of female 
characters destined to a life of 
housework and tight dresses 
with corsets worn to please 
men. The beautiful gowns that 
I was so jealous of were mere-
ly used as an attempt to catch 
the eye of a potential husband. 
The show reeked of female op-
pression. 

What exactly was I glorify-

ing? 

1813 London: a time period 

known as Regency-era Eng-
land, defined by the reign of 
the Prince of Wales who took 
to the throne when his father 
King George III was deemed 
unfit to rule due to madness. 
“Bridgerton” highlights the 
notorious social aspects of 
this period — the social sea-
son, also known as the mar-
riage market, high fashion, 
politics and gossip. Unsurpris-
ingly, this social season was 
exclusive to the upper class, 
the rich and the aristocratic 
individuals who lived their 
lives comfortably distant from 
the class struggles of the pe-
riod. This gap in the hierarchy 
of society was so cosmic that 
social mobility was virtually 
unknown — the upper class 

was not in reach of the lower 
classes and vice versa. Nota-
bly, of this era, a woman’s so-
cial standing depended on her 
reputation, which could be 
easily tarnished. 

“Bridgerton” shines light on 

the fragility of a woman’s rep-
utation — one that could be so 
easily destroyed. For example, 
being seen alone with a man, 
even if in a purely platonic 
capacity, could lead to irre-
futable damage. In the show, 
Daphne and Simon, the main 
relationship of the series, get 
caught kissing in the garden at 
one of the season’s balls. Hav-
ing been caught, and not want-
ing to ruin Daphne’s honor or 
destroy her purity (the men of 
the time period really bought 
into the idea of tainted goods), 
they had no choice but to 
marry. Why does the internet 
glorify a marriage not born of 
love, but of societal pressure 
and oppression of women? 
Despite the fact that Daphne 
and Simon ended up being in 
love after all, their marriage 
was born out of dread, with 
Simon almost risking his life 
in a duel before succumbing to 
marriage with Daphne. There 
is nothing glamorous about 
a 21-year-old woman having 
a choiceless choice: having 
to choose between being ex-
iled from society or marrying 
a man who would rather die 
than take the title of her hus-
band. 

Predictably, this was not 

the only instance of female 
oppression in the show. Elo-
ise, one of the sisters in the 
Bridgerton family, struggled 
with not being able to pursue 
her own passion. Eloise un-
derstood the sad reality that 
as a woman, she simply did 
not have the freedom to do as 
she pleased, focus on her stud-
ies and pursue a career. Eloise 
was destined to the same life 
as her sister, Daphne. 

The overwhelming female 

oppression 
throughout 
the 

show drove me to questioning 
my own thoughts. I realized 
that maybe I was just craving 
a good period piece to take 
me out of reality. Maybe I was 
dazzled by the elegant dresses 
because I haven’t worn any-
thing but sweatpants this past 
year. Maybe it was because I 
couldn’t remember the last 
large social event I have been 
to. Or possibly, the most over-
arching reason is because it 
painted a perfect, aestheti-
cally pleasing, gift-wrapped-
with-a-bow-on-top picture. 

It was a reconstructed de-

piction of the Regency Era 
for viewership, and I couldn’t 
blame the producers for doing 
so. After all, that is what cre-
ates the entire allure. When a 
show is romanticized to such a 
large extent, it is easier to look 
past the larger social issues at 
play. Despite the fact that the 
series showcased class dis-
tinctions, women’s inequality 
and female prejudice, Bridger-
ton made sure the real issues 

during this era did not over-
shadow the romantic interests 
in the series. Would the show 
be as popular if the steamy 
moments and the complexities 
of relationships was not at the 
forefront? 

I started to realize how en-

thralled I had become with the 
material aspects of historical 
pieces, rather than the great-
er historical themes. I started 
thinking about how lost I got 
in the fashion of “That ‘70s 
Show,” the coming of age, sex, 
drugs and music, that I com-
pletely overlooked aspects of 
the the 70s that made the time 
period so notable. Yes, the 70s 
was an era of fashion (bell bot-
tom jeans), disco and political 
change, but it was also a peri-
od filled with economic strug-
gle and racial tension. 

Upon further research, I re-

alized this phenomena is com-
mon with a handful of period 
pieces, whether it be obses-
sions with those of a similar 
aesthetic like “The Crown” or 
“Pride and Prejudice,” or even 
infatuation with problemat-
ic eras like the 1950s as seen 
with the “Mad Men” fandom. 

While many period pieces 

do not entirely ignore or turn 
a blind eye to the more rel-
evant themes and difficulties 
of a time period, they do tend 
to draw a picture of enchant-
ment, charm and nostalgia in 
an effort to let their viewers 
blissfully escape the present. 
Yet, even with this escapism, 
it became clear to me that de-
spite my intentions to be cul-
turally and socially aware, I 
very easily fell into the trap: 
I glorified a time period with-
out taking the implications 
into account of what that ac-
tually means. 

I don’t know how our pres-

ent is going to be written in 
history textbooks. I cannot 
speculate how the story of 
this time period will be told. 
Knowing that there is no sin-
gular moment that will define 
this period, I can only take 
guesses at what will be the 
defining moments of this era. 
However, I think the question 
of whether or not a time pe-
riod should be glorified at all, 
and to what extent, is impor-
tant. The answer is unclear, 
but for now, all I can say is 
that I will enjoy these period 
pieces with more recognition 
for what it means to glorify a 
specific part of any given time 
period. I will continue to ap-
preciate the elements that 
make a period piece so cap-
tivating, 
while 
consciously 

stopping myself from longing 
to be a part of them.

glorifying?”

Bridgerton and the 
allure of the not so 

good old days

16 — Wednesday, February 3, 2021 
statement

I 

have a playlist for social prog-
ress. From John Lennon and 
Bob Dylan’s iconic anthems 

articulating the American experi-
ence, to newer albums such as Neil 
Young’s “Living with War” and Greta 
Van Fleet’s “Anthem of the Peaceful 
Army” that reckon with our society’s 
crises and call for change, music has 
always played a profound role in the 
constant battle for social progress. 

The past 11 months have felt more 

like Barry McGuire’s “Eve of Destruc-
tion” and Nina Simone’s “Backlash 
Blues” than Pete Seeger’s “We Shall 
Overcome,” and I hit play while con-
templating “What’s Going On” and 
willing that “A Change Is Gonna 
Come.” Amid the added layers of 
chaos and uncertainty in modern life 
stemming from a pandemic and more 
political turmoil than usual, I listen 
to my playlist revering more than 60 
years of musical brilliance that is quite 
sympathetic to my pondering of soci-
ety’s shortcomings. 

“I can’t twist the truth, it knows 

no regulation // Handful of Senators 
don’t pass legislation, // And marches 
alone can’t bring integration // When 
human respect is disintegratin’ // This 
whole crazy world is just too frustra-
tin’ // And you tell me over and over 
and over again my friend // Ah, you 
don’t believe we’re on the eve of de-
struction” - Barry McGuire, “Eve of 
Destruction”

Between the 1950s and 1970s, 

the United States was polarized by 
the Vietnam War, the Civil Rights 
Movement, the feminist sexual 
revolution, the emergence of coun-
terculture and the rebellion of ado-
lescents, the beginning of gay libera-
tion and the modern environmental 
movement. Further, the ways a per-
son takes a stance on these issues 
proves to be a statement of one’s 
ideal world, otherwise known as the 
theory of cultural cognition, which 
can exacerbate divides and stunt 
both social and political progress. 

In the past year, a multitude of 

injustices have been thrust into the 
forefront of public consciousness. Yet, 
thousands, if not millions, still ques-
tion the legitimacy of today’s greatest 
issues, as reflected by instances like 
the Capitol insurrection, in which 
people defend the social structures 
and institutions that have permitted 
injustices.

It seems that both throughout the 

revolutionary decade of the 60s and 
today, the issues making headlines 
have intersected in the ideologies of 
either aspiring to solve injustices or 
the alternative of defending the way 
things are. And all along, throughout 
this endless struggle for social prog-
ress, music has served to empower 
and unite those on either side, while 

reflecting the sociopolitical senti-
ments of our nation and its people.

I wanted to understand the time-

lessness of the music on my playlist, so 
I interviewed University of Michigan 
American Culture professor Ste-
phen Berrey, an expert in 20th cen-
tury American history, over a Zoom 
call. During our discussion, Berrey 
made a point to note the critical fact 
that during the 60s, the activity for 
social change originated as grass-
roots movements.

“Social change was coming from 

ordinary people that were organizing 
and mobilizing for change,” Berrey 
explained. “The music began tapping 
into the idea that (ordinary citizens) 
can change things. The 60s represent 
this moment in which, in the air, there 
is this sense that we should be chal-
lenging authority and norms. And the 
music of the time was reflecting the 
spirit of change.”

Perhaps that is why so much music 

of the 60s and 70s has found its way 
into my playlist for social progress. 
No matter the release date or label of 
genre, albums and singles from de-
cades ago feel like they could have 
been cultivated amid the crises thrust 
onto the national stage in 2020 after 
gaining steam in city centers across 
the country. The polarization and 
obvious corruption, complicated by 
simultaneous movements for racial, 
economic, social and environmental 
justice, produced music that remains 
a poignant reflection of the United 
States’ shortcomings and struggles.

“Oh, you know we’ve got to find a 

way // To bring some understanding 
here today // Picket lines and picket 
signs // Don’t punish me with bru-
tality // Come on talk to me // So you 
can see // What’s going on” - Marvin 
Gaye, “What’s Going On”

Recognizing my risk of sounding 

nostalgic for the music of a time period 
I did not live through, I must acknowl-
edge the inclusion of newer music on 
my playlist that is just as powerful as 
that of the past. Andrew Bird artfully 
acknowledges the existential crisis 
of climate change in “Manifest Des-
tiny” and America’s political circus in 
“Bloodless.” Beyonce’s “Freedom” be-
came an anthem for the Black Lives 
Matter Movement. Hozier’s “Take Me 
To Church” contemplates all the rea-
sons we should question the Catholic 
Church. There are countless songs, 
both new and old, questioning our so-
cial structures and addressing the evils 
that America and, in many cases, the 
world can’t seem to definitively defeat.

“Well, the best lack all conviction // 

And the worst keep sharpening their 
claws // They’re peddling in their 
dark fictions // While what’s left of us 
// Well, we just hem and we haw” - 
Andrew Bird, “Bloodless”

Among the explicitly political mu-

sic of the 21st century is a wealth of 
songs rejecting the man that emerged 
to embody America’s unfinished big-
otry and ignorance, former President 
Donald Trump. Music is inherently 
political in itself, as are the circum-
stances and statements of musicians. 
During the 2016 election, artists 
joined forces on the project “1,000 
Days, 1,000 Songs” to reject, as Franz 
Ferdinand labels Trump in their con-
tribution to the project, a dangerous 
“Demagogue.” From “Locker Room 
Talk” by the Cold War Kids to Death 
Cab For Cutie’s “Million Dollar Loan,” 
musicians have responded to Trump’s 
candidacy and election with more dis-
gusted fervor and illuminating music 
than previously produced in spite of 
any other president.

Prior to the 2020 election, Demi 

Lovato condemned Trump’s inaction 
in “Commander In Chief,’’ and Mt. 
Joy released a straightforward single 
titled “New President.” Macklemore’s 
multitude of songs addressing issues 
such as same-sex marraige, white 
privilege and consumerism made his 
political positions clear long before 
the summation of America’s greatest 
evils were elected to the Oval Office. 
Since then, he has become explic-
itly critical of the former president, 
with his poignant reflection of the 
“Wednesday Morning” on which 
Trump’s victory was declared and 
his farewell to his Trump-supporting 
supporters in the recently released 
“Trump’s Over Freestyle.”

“Humanity is a privilege, we can’t 

give in // When they build walls, we’ll 
build bridges // This is resistance, 
we’re resilient // When they spread 
hate, we shine brilliant” - Mackl-
emore, “Wednesday Morning”

Aside from the release of explic-

itly anti-Trump art, many musicians 
have made their political positions 
very clear since he announced his 
candidacy in 2016. The Rolling 
Stones, Creedence Clearwater Re-
vival, Tom Petty’s family and many 
more took legal action against the 
campaign, demanding the Trump 
campaign stop playing their music. 
In addition to issuing a cease and 
desist order, CCR’s vocalist John Fo-
gerty publicly expressed his bewil-
derment that the campaign played 
the band’s iconic hit “Fortunate 
Son” that condemns silver-spoon, 
draft-dodging hypocrites at rallies 
that celebrate and try to keep one in 
the Oval Office. There is an incred-
ibly long list of artists — including 
Axl Rose from Guns N’Roses, Ri-
hanna, Brendon Urie and Adele, just 
to name a few — who have com-
municated their scorn for the for-
mer president in various types of 
public statements.

Aside from the campaign, many 

musicians, including Elton John 
and Céline Dion, declined to be-
come involved with the 45th presi-
dent during his presidency. Trump’s 
Inauguration Committee struggled 
to find A-listers for his inaugural 
events, a stark contrast to the star 
power of this month’s musical offer-
ings supporting the new adminis-
tration. Obama’s inaugurations fea-
tured Aretha Franklin, Pete Seeger, 
U2 and Beyonce. Biden’s inaugural 
events boasted Bruce Springsteen, 
Bon Jovi, Lady Gaga and a New 
Radicals reunion. These observa-
tions made headlines because 
people acknowledge the power 
of music and, for reasons good or 
bad, see these performances as po-
litical endorsements. 

Inaugural performances and In-

stagram posts are some of the ways 
musicians have made political state-
ments this past year, and considering 
the chaos, division and crises, the age-
old question of what an artist’s social 
responsibility is seems more impor-
tant than ever. But this question is 
convoluted by the ways the music in-
dustry often determines which artists, 
and thus what music, reach the mass-
es, not to mention the complication 
of art by the desire for profit. After all, 
the music industry parallels mankind 
with a dark history of exploitation, ex-
clusivity, suppression and greed.

At the end of the day, I do not know 

what artists ought to do with their 
platforms. Over a Zoom call, Kira 
Thurman, a Germanic Languages 
and Literatures and History Univer-
sity Professor and a musician, consid-
ered this question as we mulled over 
whether musicians have an obligation 
to limit their nonmusical business 
pursuits or pick red or blue: “It may be 
unanswerable, but we ask it because 
we recognize the potential of music to 
transform the world,” Thurman said. 

Cutting through the complications 

of this question, Thurman offered an 
idea that, to me, seems to serve as an 
answer: “Maybe this is the scary, damn-
ing indictment: There is no ‘art for art’s 
sake.’ Art is socially constructed.” 

You cannot separate the art from 

the artist nor from the society it was 
born out of, and the question of the 
artist’s social responsibility is insepa-
rable from the actuality that the mu-
sic speaks for the artist and itself. The 
greatest responsibility lies in the pow-
er of the music. We can argue over the 
question until another fascist runs 
for president, but at the end of 
the day, given the inherently po-
litical nature and profound power 
of music, we ought to critically 
question, consciously consume 
and vigorously scrutinize the mu-
sic we choose to listen to. 

That is not to say we must solely 

submerge ourselves in music that di-
rectly addresses the heavy dilemmas 
of mankind, considering their exacer-
bation during the past year. To quote 
The Byrds, “to everything, there is a 
season, and a time to every purpose.” 
There is great importance in music 
being fun, playful and filled with en-
thusiasm for life, even when the value 
of life and the love of living it are 
influenced by the realities of willful 
ignorance, institutional inequality 
and oppression. 

Music that does not instantly regis-

ter as being political is political and so-
cially meaningful nonetheless. Teen-
age angst, battling inner demons and 
drug addictions, breakups and body 
image all find their way into music, 
and are, of course, crucially important 
to the individual. Songs like Lizzo’s 
“Fitness,” Lady Gaga’s “Born This 
Way,” and Macklemore’s “Starting 
Over” inextricably involve the con-
cepts of love, belonging, compas-
sion and courage, and how we value 
these ideals inform our desires for 
social change and the politics that 
shape our world.

For obvious reasons that are elo-

quently expressed and best under-
stood by the songs themselves, music 
is incredibly powerful and influential. 
It reflects and challenges us, teaches, 
empowers, explains, inspires and aids 
us. In all of its profound power, it af-
fects how and who we choose to be in 
the world, and thus, how we change it. 

“Read the news, there’s something 

every day // So many people thinking 
different ways, you say // Where is the 
music? // A tune to free the soul // A 
simple lyric to unite us all, you know” 
- Greta Van Fleet, “Anthem”

Looking at the current state of af-

fairs, it is quite easy to claim we are at 
the “Eve of Destruction.” The conse-
quences of humankind’s vices, taking 
form in corruption and injustice and 
resulting in unnecessary suffering and 
death, are depressing and daunting. 
But hope and working for change to-
day is the only path leading to a better 
tomorrow, and music will always play 
a profound part in inspiring, empow-
ering and affirming these endeavors. 

So, tuning out all the noise and 

turning the volume up, I hit shuf-
fle on my paramount playlist, and 
from Neil Young’s “Love and War,” 
to Harry Chapin’s “What Made 
America Famous?”, from John Len-
non’s “Imagine” to The Youngblood’s 
“Get Together,” from Billy Joel’s “We 
Didn’t Start the Fire” to Greta Van 
Fleet’s “Black Smoke Rising” and 
the many, many masterpieces in 
between, I let the music open my 
mind and soothe my soul with un-
wavering hope and trust in that “A 
Change is Gonna Come.”

Despite unusual season, women’s rowing 

makes headway

What the 14-day pause means 

for women’s basketball

On Thursday, Michigan lost its 

first game of the season, falling 

77-81 to Ohio State. Junior forward 

Naz 
Hillmon 
had 
a 
historic 

performance with 50 points, but 

the Wolverines couldn’t find the 

win in the end. 

In a normal season, the first loss 

would sting for a few days only to 

be forgotten after the next game. 

But this isn’t a typical season. 

Michigan’s defeat may linger a little 

longer as the Wolverines embark 

on a 14-day pause due to positive 

cases of the novel COVID-19 

B.1.1.7 variant within the Michigan 

athletic department. 

The directive is just one of a 

string of obstacles Michigan has 

already faced. In fact, it isn’t even 

the first break the team’s dealt 

with. The Wolverines faced a 

22-day break in December after 

canceling games against Illinois 

and Penn State in accordance 

with COVID-19 protocols. When 

Michigan returned on Dec. 31 

against Wisconsin, it seemed as 

though they hadn’t missed a beat, 

defeating them, 92-49, with only 

eight players eligible. 

The Wolverines struggled to field 

a full team against Northwestern 

too. Conditions worsened against 

Nebraska on Jan. 7, when junior 

guard Leigha Brown, the team’s 

second-leading scorer, was absent 

due to COVID-19 protocols. 

The break will mean that the 

Wolverines will miss important 

games 
against 
Purdue, 
two 

against Michigan State, Rutgers, 

Minnesota 
and 
Maryland. 
If 

everything goes to plan, Michigan 

can return on Feb. 11 against 

Purdue. 

Since 
November, 
the 

Wolverines have been preparing 

for an unconventional season — 

temporary 
shutdowns 
seemed 

likely from the start. 

“We saw that basketball could 

actually be taken away, and we 

were disappointed with the way 

that the season finished last year,” 

Michigan 
coach 
Kim 
Barnes 

Arico said on Nov. 25 following 

Michigan’s 
win 
over 
Central 

Michigan, their first game of the 

season. “We didn’t get to play 

in the NCAA Tournament. We 

thought we had an awesome squad 

returning but we are so happy with 

the ability to be able to play today.”

Although the team has faced 

ineligibility 
due 
to 
COVID-

19 protocols in the past, as of 

Saturday, the team didn’t have any 

active cases.

The majority of the Wolverines’ 

starters have remained healthy 

to this point and a pause like this 

could allow for Leigha Brown to 

return without missing any more 

games. Even though Michigan is on 

pause now, the team understands 

that COVID-19 can still impact the 

remainder of the season.

“We understand that this is 

a different year, unprecedented 

times 
and 
we’re 
just 
really 

focusing on next man up,” junior 

forward Naz Hillmon said Jan. 

3 following Michigan’s win over 

Northwestern. “We have numbers 

called being there ready to play and 

we really try to not take our games 

for granted. You never know what’s 

going to happen tomorrow.”

In what has thus far been Barnes 

Arico’s most successful season in 

her nine years with the Wolverines, 

Michigan’s experience has come 

to the fore. The Wolverines were 

undefeated before their matchup 

against 
Ohio 
State, 
currently 

sitting at No. 12 in the most recent 

AP Poll. Core players like Hillmon, 

junior guard Amy Dilk and fifth-

year senior Akienreh Johnson have 

all stepped up only for their future 

as a Wolverine to be uncertain. 

Michigan has already proven 

this team is capable of anything 

when healthy. Once the pause is 

lifted, the Wolverines will try to 

continue their strong start. 

Right now, it’s just a question of 

when — and if — Michigan can get 

back on the court. 

It’s still early on a crisp fall 

morning in Ann Arbor, the sun 

just starting to peek through 

the fog, the dew settling into the 

still-green grass.

As the city begins to wake up, 

the Michigan women’s rowing 

team has long since started their 

day. The coxswains’ cries of 

encouragement rise above the 

constant whir of ergometer fans, 

set in formation on the field, six 

feet apart in the shadow of the 

Michigan Stadium’s Block ‘M.’ 

When 
the 
pandemic 
hit 

and canceled the remaining 11 

regattas of the Wolverines’ 2020 

spring racing season, it came as 

a shock to the team. But since 

then, with pandemic protocols 

in place, they have not let the 

strong headwind that is COVID-

19 prevent them from making 

headway on their goals. 

“It’s been a big change for 

everybody,” Michigan coach 

Mark Rothstein said. “Those 

have been some big changes, 

though 
— 
imagine 
rowing 

in a mask; it can get pretty 

uncomfortable, 
especially 

during the hard workouts.”

Rowing is a sport that relies 

on team chemistry to a degree 

that few others do. If one rower 

is even a fraction of a beat off-

rhythm, just the slightest bit off-

balance, the boat can rock back 

and forth or oars can catch crabs 

underwater, 
amongst 
other 

things that can happen to slow 

the boat down. 

With social distancing still 

firmly in place, the Wolverines 

have had to find other ways to 

bond as a team. 

“We’ve all had to rely on 

reaching out to each other a 

lot more, because last year, you 

could go up to your friend after 

a workout and give them a pat 

on the back or just say hello and 

physically be there,” sophomore 

Elena Collier-Hezel said. “This 

year, the biggest difference is 

that we can’t really see a lot of 

our teammates at one time, so 

we have to reach out to each 

other more, and when we get the 

opportunity, saying, ‘Hey, I’m 

here, hope you’re doing well.’ ”

It’s been particularly tough 

on the underclassmen: the 

freshmen, because their first 

season 
of 
college 
rowing 

(not to mention their first 

year of college) is abnormal 

beyond anything they could’ve 

imagined; 
the 
sophomores, 

because they are yet to have a 

first season under their belts, 

having had every spring race 

canceled. 

As a result, the juniors and 

especially 
the 
seniors 
are 

stepping up to perpetuate the 

team atmosphere that was a 

key factor in many of these 

women’s decisions to come to 

Michigan. 

“Our biggest strength as 

a team is our team culture,” 

fifth-year starboard Madison 

Byrd said. “It’s just taking 

advantage of those moments 

where we’re putting the boats 

in the bays, or during water 

breaks, those are really the 

only times you’re going to have 

in close proximity together, so 

just taking advantage of that. 

“As a senior class, we’ve 

really had to just keep the main 

thing the ‘main thing,’ which 

is training to win and win for 

Michigan.” 

Confident in the bonds his 

team can create, even in a 

pandemic year, Rothstein is 

focusing on making sure that 

the Wolverines are still on track 

to the lofty goals he’s set for 

them. The bar is high: Michigan 

won the Big Ten in 2019 and 

placed third at the NCAA 

championship the same year. 

And 
it 
turns 
out 
that, 

as grueling as the rowing 

workouts tend to be, there have 

been a few pluses to this very 

negative year. The team has 

had more chances to get out 

on the water, thanks to a few 

unseasonably 
warm 
winter 

days. Also, working out at the 

Big House, on the field and 

under the lights, is undeniably 

cool. 

For the coxswains, whose job 

is to steer the boat and spur the 

rowers on, encouragement and 

motivation have taken on a new 

meaning this year, spurring a 

new approach. 

“I’m usually a pretty big 

hard-ass 100% of the time,” 

senior 
coxswain 
Charlotte 

Powers said. “But especially 

with COVID, the importance 

of 
positivity 
and 
keeping 

everyone’s attitudes up has been 

super important because it’s 

obviously really hard for them 

both mentally and physically. 

So I just think keeping that 

mindset of ‘we’re on the water, 

we’re getting to practice, we’re 

here still’ is huge. It’s way more 

‘let’s enjoy this and let’s keep 

using this as a building block.’ ”

It’s 
been 
an 
effective 

adjustment — there’s a sense 

of gratitude in these rowers’ 

voices, an appreciation for the 

chance to compete at the sport 

they love, no matter what it 

looks like. 

“We had to keep reminding 

ourselves that we are here to 

win a national championship, so 

as long as that’s still on the table, 

we’ll go through anything,” Byrd 

said. “Keeping our eyes on the 

prize — I know it’s kind of cliché, 

but keeping our hearts and our 

minds focused on training for 

Michigan so that, come May, we 

can win for Michigan has been 

what we’ve been trying to keep 

at the forefront of our minds.

“Just because of a new change 

that might come our way, or a 

new protocol, or new rules or 

something else gets taken away, 

we have to remember that we’re 

not here for the gear or the free 

meals. We’re here to represent 

the Block ‘M.’ So always coming 

back to that, in spite of whatever 

difficulty we’re facing, that’s 

been crucial for us.”

The Wolverines are finding creative ways to adapt its team culture and training to the pandemic.

A week on, Michigan’s athletic department shutdown makes even less sense

Nine days ago, Michigan’s 

athletic department issued a 

14-day shutdown of all Uni-

versity athletic activities due 

to the detection of cases of 

the more contagious B.1.1.7 

COVID-

19 
variant 

within 
the 

athletic 

department.

 
At 
the 

time, 
the 

directive 

seemed to be 

an unneces-

sary blanket 

response to a targeted issue. 

The new variant of COVID-19 

was discovered in a handful 

of teams, so teams that had no 

COVID-19 cases at all also had 

to shut down? Despite teams 

not having contact with one 

another? All while the rest of 

the state went about life with 

minimal restrictions?

 Since then, we’ve learned 

a little bit more about how 

the decision came into being. 

It was technically a “recom-

mendation” from the Mich-

igan Department of Health 

and 
Human 
Services, 
not 

an 
order. 
Understandably, 

though, the University viewed 

it as an order. A public univer-

sity ignoring a cut-and-dry, 

stop-it-now 
directive 
from 

its own state government is a 

non-starter, no matter what 

label you use.

 We’ve also learned that 

the University proposed only 

affected teams be isolated. 

That would’ve enabled Mich-

igan’s moneymakers — men’s 

basketball, women’s basket-

ball and hockey all of which 

had no COVID-19 cases as of 

last weekend — to keep play-

ing. The state refused. 

Teams were sent scram-

bling to make socially-dis-

tanced travel arrangements 

back from away competitions. 

Players were resigned to their 

apartments for two weeks, 

unable to work out or practice 

in team facilities.

 Both of those realizations 

serve to absolve the Univer-

sity of blame. What they don’t 

do is make the state’s directive 

any more logical.

 “While U-M has worked 

diligently 
on 
testing 
and 

reporting within state and Big 

Ten Conference guidelines, 

the Michigan Department of 

Health and Human Services 

is mandating a more aggres-

sive strategy for this B.1.1.7 

variant, which exceeds cur-

rent program efforts designed 

around the standard form of 

the virus,” the University said 

in a release on Jan. 23.

 Here’s the thing: The state 

isn’t mandating a more aggres-

sive strategy for the B.1.1.7 

variant anywhere outside of 

the Michigan athletic depart-

ment. And that’s the problem.

If the state cared about pre-

venting the spread of the new 

variant, it would have enacted 

wide-scale lockdowns. A year 

of evidence from around the 

world shows that’s the only 

way to actually stem COVID-

19. If the state didn’t care 

about preventing the spread, 

it should’ve let teams with-

out positive cases continue 

playing. Because ultimately, 

they’re the same as everyone 

else in the community who 

hasn’t been exposed to the 

new variant.

 
Instead, 
nine 
days 
of 

inaction from the state has 

revealed the forced shutdown 

of Michigan’s athletic depart-

ment to be little more than a 

PR stunt.

 On Wednesday, Washtenaw 

County issued a stay-at-home 

recommendation for Michigan 

students. What happens if stu-

dents don’t follow the recom-

mendation? According to the 

Washtenaw 
County 
Health 

Department, that would force 

more recommendations. In a 

shock to absolutely nobody, 

the 
recommendation 
has 

proved meaningless, because 

it carries no repercussions.

 On Monday, restaurants and 

bars will be allowed to open 

for indoor dining, even though 

maskless, 
indoor 
activities 

create a perfect environment 

for COVID-19 to spread.

So does the state really 

care about stemming this new 

variant or was last week’s 

directive truly a PR stunt? Its 

actions — or lack thereof — in 

the last week indicate the lat-

ter.

And if you find yourself 

looking at the CDC dashboard 

and 
thinking, 
‘Hey, 
there 

are only 22 recorded cases of 

the B.1.1.7 variant in Michi-

gan,’ consider the parallels to 

March. 

Testing reveals the variant 

is virtually non-existent, yet 

it’s still shown up in multi-

ple Michigan counties and is 

present in 30 U.S. states. As 

of Sunday, there have been 

467 reported cases in the 

country. 
For 
comparison’s 

sake, there were 403 report-

ed cases of COVID-19 in the 

U.S. on March 7. Two weeks 

later, there were 26,025 cases. 

Without real restrictions, the 

B.1.1.7 variant can and will 

chart a similar course.

 If the state really wanted to 

curb the variant’s spread, the 

blueprint is in place to do so. 

Instead, it’s opted for a half-

baked approach that helps no 

one.

 This means that if Michi-

gan athletics return to action 

next week as they’re current-

ly scheduled to, they’ll return 

to a community with more 

spread of the B.1.1.7 variant 

than there was a week ago. 

Eventually, 
odds 
are 
that 

someone else in the athletic 

department will contract the 

variant because the spread 

hasn’t been stemmed within 

the larger community.

By that point, though, the 

Michigan athletic department 

won’t be the state’s B.1.1.7 epi-

center. Yet another new defi-

nition of normalcy will arrive. 

The PR value of taking faux 

action will be gone. The men’s 

and women’s basketball teams 

will head off to the NCAA 

Tournament.

When they get there, it may 

be too late. Their seasons may 

have been derailed by two 

weeks off practice. Even if not, 

seniors will have still lost two 

weeks of their fleeting college 

careers.

Eleven months into the pan-

demic, that’s the cost of PR.

With restaurants re-opening a week into the athletic department’s pause, many are left to question the state’s approach to COVID-19.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

The spotlight often eludes 

Nick Blankenburg.

The 
junior 
defenseman 

is overlooked in Michigan’s 
star-studded defensive group. 
Freshman 
Owen 
Power 
is 

the 
potential 
number 
one 

overall pick in next year’s 
NHL draft. Sophomore Cam 
York captained the USA World 
Juniors team that won gold last 
month.

But despite the lack of 

recognition, Blankenburg still 
finds a way to thrive.

“I don’t think that bothers 

Nick at all,” Michigan coach 
Mel Pearson said. “He just 
plays. There’s not much that 
rattles him, he’s just a hockey 
player.”

During his freshman year, 

Blankenburg 
had 
just 
two 

goals and eight assists but led 
the Wolverines in plus-minus 
at plus-11. Last season, he 
produced more offensively — 
putting up four goals and 12 
assists — but his plus-minus 
was down significantly at plus-
3. This year, he’s putting it all 
together.

Through 
sixteen 
games, 

Blankenburg has four goals and 
seven assists, and those 11 points 
are good enough for third among 
all Big Ten defensemen. He also 
boasts a plus-minus of plus-12, 
the second best on the team. 

“He skates, adds offense, 

plays hard (and) physical,” 
Pearson said. “And he’s just 
engaged. I don’t know if I’ve 
ever had to tell him to pick it 
up.”

Blankenburg has become a 

workhorse for Michigan and 
developed 
into 
a 
two-way 

threat. He’s found a home 
on a line with Power and the 
pair complement each other 
well. They have boosted the 
Wolverines’ power play — each 
contributing two goals on the 
man advantage.

“I’ve really liked playing 

with him,” Power said on Nov. 
24. “He’s such a good skater; 
so quick and so fast. We can 
both play tight, stay up on the 
forwards and have trust in each 
other where if one of us gets 
beat, we could help them.”

Throughout 
his 
career, 

Blankenburg 
has 
always 

carried a subtle confidence to 
his game. He never gets caught 
up with the distractions or 
complains about his role. He 
puts his head down and grinds. 

“He just loves playing the 

game,” Pearson said. “He just 
comes to the rink and does his 
job and plays hard every day. 
There’s no attitude, there’s no 
cockiness to him. And there’s 
no entitlement to him, he just 
comes in and plays and that’s 
what makes him so special.”

Those characteristics have 

made 
a 
lasting 
impression 

on his teammates and are 

why they voted him alternate 
captain 
this 
year. 
Adding 

Blankenburg to the leadership 
group has been important for 
keeping the team together as 
they navigate a season through 
the COVID-19 pandemic. 

However, 
if 
there’s 
one 

knock on Blankenburg’s game 
this season, it’s the amount 
of penalties he’s taken. In 
35 games last year, he only 
committed 
seven 
penalties. 

This year, he’s already up to 
six. But Pearson isn’t deterred 
by Blankenburg spending more 
time in the box. He thinks 
that the penalties are more a 
by-product of Blankenburg’s 
highly competitive nature than 
a sign of undisciplined play. 

“I’ve had to tell him to 

relax and calm down a little 
bit because he goes after 
it so hard,” Pearson said. 
“Sometimes he gets wound up 
and he really gets into it.”

Blankenburg 
may 
never 

garner the attention or the 
awards 
that 
some 
of 
his 

teammates get. But his work 
ethic 
and 
the 
consistent 

effort he brings has earned 
the respect of his teammates 
and 
his 
coaches, 
and 
the 

team knows he’s vital to the 
Wolverines success. 

“(He’s) as tough — pound for 

pound — as anybody maybe in 
our league, maybe in college 
hockey,” Pearson said. “He 
might be our most valuable 
player.”

Blankenburg quietly produces for 

‘M’ defense

RYAN LITTLE/Daily 

Michigan defenseman Nick Blankenburg quietly commands his defense amongst more talented players.

Akienreh Johnson does it all.
The fifth-year senior guard 

has been an integral part of 
the No. 13 Michigan women’s 
basketball team’s 10-1 start 
to the season. While junior 
forward Naz Hillmon usually 
takes the spotlight with her 
perennially dominant outings, 
Johnson uses her experience to 
fill in the gaps on both ends of 
the floor.

On the offensive end, her 

scoring ability is a valuable 
asset to the Wolverines’ attack. 
She averages 11.8 points per 
game, good enough to be the 
team’s 
third-leading 
scorer. 

Given the recent absence of 
junior guard Leigha Brown, 
Michigan’s 
second-leading 

scorer, Johnson has stepped 
up to fill the void. In the last 
three games, she’s averaged 15 
points. 

Johnson’s aggressive nature 

is a defining characteristic of 
her offense — it creates trips 

to the free-throw line and 
sparks momentum for the 
Wolverines. When offensive 
production 
is 
lagging, 

Johnson’s not afraid to get in 
the lane and make something 
happen. Her ability to drive 
and dish is an important facet 
of Michigan’s offense and 
averaging three assists per 
game, she works well with 
Hillmon down low.

Defensively, 
Johnson 
is 

arguably Michigan’s biggest 
asset. 
She 
often 
guards 

opposing teams’ top guards 
and has been successful in 
keeping 
them 
contained. 

Against Wisconsin, she held 
guard Sydney Hilliard, who 
averages 17 points per game on 
the season, to just one point.

“(Johnson) doesn’t get a ton 

of credit all the time for the 
things that she does that don’t 
show up in the box score, but 
she guards the other team’s 
best player and she takes that 
to heart,” Wolverines’ coach 
Kim Barnes Arico said after 
the game against the Badgers 
on Jan. 14. “(Johnson) was 

guarding (Hilliard) tonight, 
and (Hilliard) didn’t score 
a point on her. She came out 
of the game and I just said, 
‘unbelievable.’ ”

Johnson has also contributed 

to 
Michigan’s 
number 
one 

ranking in rebounding in the 
Big Ten, averaging 5.8 per game. 
Being a tall guard standing at 
6-foot-0, she crashes boards 
and assists Hillmon in keeping 
the ball away from opposing 
teams. 

“Akienreh Johnson is, I think 

the best defender in the Big 
Ten, one of the best defenders 
in the country,” Barnes Arico 
said after the Northwestern 
game on Jan. 3. “She’s up to 
every challenge, and she does 
a great job of really locking in.”

Overall, 
her 
numbers 

aren’t flashy, in fact, they’re 
comparable to the rest of 
the starters on the team. But 
Johnson’s ability to do a little 
of everything is what keeps 
her on the floor. She reads the 
floor well and fills in where 
other players lack, making her 
invaluable in the lineup.

Johnson’s defensive prowess proves 
vital to Michigan’s high-flying team

Senior 
forward 
Chaundee 

Brown Jr. elevated for a putback 
slam, putting the finishing touches 
on a dominant 77-54 win for the 
Michigan men’s basketball team 
on Jan. 12. As Brown dismounted 
from the rim, the bench went into 
a frenzy, jumping and screaming 
as if to turn Crisler Center into a 
rocking full house for just a few 
short moments. 

This scene is one of many 

examples of the energy the 
Wolverines’ 
second 
unit 
has 

brought to coach Juwan Howard’s 
club this season. Even when 
the starters are on the floor, the 
bench has created somewhat of a 
spectacle on the sidelines. Led by 
Jace Howard, the self-proclaimed 
“Bench Mob” has become an 
unmistakable and essential sight 
of every Michigan game.

“It really helps having an 

engaged bench, and I think it 
makes everything a lot more fun,” 
sophomore wing Franz Wagner 
said after the win against the 
Badgers.

As effective as their passion is 

off the court, the bench has also 
provided consistent production, 
making Michigan one of the 
deepest teams in the nation. 
Brown, in particular, has fit in 
seamlessly in his first campaign 
in Ann Arbor, averaging 8.8 points 
per game and shooting just under 
40% from the 3-point range, while 
also emerging as one of the top 
perimeter defenders in the Big 
Ten. Even though he was a three-
year starter at Wake Forest, Brown 
understands his role as a spark 
plug off the bench at Michigan.

“Coach Howard always talks 

about sacrificing,” Brown said 

after an 80-58 win over UCF. 
“We’re sacrificing a lot of things 
that on other teams, we would’ve 
been star players or starting but 
we’re taking a second role on a 
winning team. We’re just always 
ready.”

The 
Wolverines’ 
bench 

production 
doesn’t 
end 
with 

Brown. Junior forward Brandon 
Johns Jr. has proven to be a 
serviceable backup ‘5’ off the 
bench and is shooting 63% from 
3-point range. Freshman forward 
Terrance Williams and freshman 
guard Zeb Jackson have helped 
to provide energy in their first 
collegiate campaigns, and senior 
forward/center Austin Davis has 
built off last year’s breakout season 
after returning from a plantar 
fasciitis injury. 

“We have a very deep team,” 

Howard said after the win over 
UCF. “Our thing is all hands on 
deck. And game-by-game, it’s 
always being evaluated on what’s 
giving us the bench chance. But 
we’re gonna need everyone this 
season, it’s that simple. I’ll make 
sure everyone gets the chance to 
play.”

On Dec. 31 in an 84-73 win 

Maryland, the Wolverines went 
on a 31-9 second half run, in part 
due to an impressive defensive 
showing. After the game, though, 
Howard gave credit not only to 
the players on the court during the 
run, but also the energy brought by 
his reserves on the sidelines.

“I give all the credit to the 

defense, and I also give all the 
credit to those guys that were 
sitting on the bench bringing that 
energy,” Howard said after the 
game. “And that’s what keyed our 
run. The defensive disposition 
and also the energy from the guys 
that hadn’t even checked into the 
game or the guys that were taking 
a breather that were sitting on 
the bench, breathing life into the 
players that were on the floor.”

Even when they aren’t playing, 

Michigan’s 
“Bench 
Mob” 
is 

finding ways to affect the game. 
With a tough Big Ten slate 
awaiting the Wolverines once play 
resumes, the bench will surely 
continue to bring the energy and, 
more importantly, be ready to 
contribute on the floor when their 
numbers are called.

Power enjoys impressive season 
away from Canadian spotlight

Owen 
Power 
knew 
the 

expectations on him this season 
were lofty. Coming into the season 
as a potential top pick in the 
2021 NHL Draft, the freshman 
defenseman’s star only shone 
brighter following a three-point 
performance in his Michigan 
debut.

In the nine games that followed, 

though, Power registered only 
a single assist. Despite his low 
offensive output, Power never 
looked out of place in the college 
game — he’s a highly-touted 
prospect for a reason. He was 
still one of the Wolverines’ best 
defensemen even as his offensive 
game lagged a bit behind.

It’s fair to wonder if all of the 

potential 
distractions 
Power 

faced in the first half of the season 
ever got in his head. On top of 
the draft, the controversy over 
whether or not Power would be 
attending Canada’s World Juniors 
camp proved to be a constant 
talking point. 

“I think the decision to have 

me stay here and play was fine,” 
Power told reporters on Jan. 11. 
“I think either way it was a good 
decision. So I think just being 
able to stay here and kind of just 
develop with the team was a good 
decision.”

Power said all the right things 

about not attending World Juniors 
and has said the draft has not been 

a distraction, but his play in the 
second half of the season tells a 
different story. The combination 
of an extended break, extra 
practice time and the experience 
Power has gained is likely behind 
his improvement, but it’s fair to 
assume that the lack of World 
Junior’s chatter has played a role.

“There 
were 
a 
lot 
of 

distractions, and we have to make 
sure that we really put that behind 
us and the outside noise and just 
focus in on our team,” Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson said. “We do 
that (and) I think you’ll see a real 
good second half.”

While Pearson was talking 

about the team as a whole, Power 
has epitomized his sentiment, 
especially offensively. In the 
six games since the Wolverines 
returned from their break, Power 
has accumulated eight points. 
While plus/minus doesn’t fully 
convey a player’s impact, Power 
is a plus-8 in those six games. In 
Michigan’s first 10 games, he was 
a plus-1, which is telling.

The biggest difference for 

Power lies in getting more 
shots through. He has put 
multiple shots on net in six of 
the Wolverines’ last nine games, 
after doing so just twice in their 
first seven. 

This 
change 
has 
forced 

opposing teams to respect his 
shot even more in the offensive 
zone, opening up chances for 
his teammates. And Power has 
learned how to take advantage of 
that.

In a Jan. 22 win against Notre 

Dame, Power showed just how 
dangerous he can be when teams 
view him as a shooting threat. 
With the puck at the point, 
Power convincingly faked a shot, 
drawing the attention of multiple 
Fighting 
Irish 
players 
and 

leaving senior forward Michael 
Pastujov open at the right circle. 
Power dished it off and Pastujov 
converted.

Power’s 
evolution 
into 
a 

consistent offensive threat has 
also paid dividends for Michigan’s 
power play, with Power’s unit 
scoring four goals on the man 
advantage since the break.

“We lean on (the freshmen) 

a little bit more in the second 
half because they know the 
expectations and the standards of 
our program now and how hard 
it is in the Big Ten,” Pearson said. 
“When you first start you have to 
be careful with them.”

Transitioning to the college 

game is difficult for any player, 
even one of Power’s stature. 
The players are older and more 
experienced and the games are 
more physical. Add the potential 
of being the first overall pick in 
the upcoming NHL Draft and it 
makes sense that other players 
have stolen the spotlight in the 
first half.

But now, with all the possible 

distractions in the rearview mirror 
and 16 games under his belt, Power 
continues to show, game after 
game, why those expectations 
were so high in the first place.

Michigan guard Zeb Jackson helps keep the team’s spirits up.

Wolverine bench sparks their team on 

and off the court


On 
Dec. 
23, 
third-ranked 

Villanova dominated Big East 
foe, Marquette, to move to 8-1 on 
the season. Four days later, the 
Wildcats announced that coach Jay 
Wright and another staff member 
had tested positive for COVID-19. 

Despite pausing practice and 

all basketball activities in the 
wake of the news, issues persisted 
within the program over the 
next two weeks. Villanova was 
forced to postpone four games — 
without makeup dates set. Every 
time it seemed like the Wildcats 
could come back, another positive 
case sent them back to square 
one. Villanova finally returned 
to action on Jan. 19, narrowly 
escaping against Seton Hall, 
76-74 — 27 days after beating 
the Golden Eagles. Whatever 
momentum the Wildcats had 
built at the start of the season had 
seemingly dissipated. 

“We got lucky against Seton 

Hall,” Wright said. “... We 
weren’t in rhythm.” 

Faced with a lengthy layoff 

of its own, the No. 7 Michigan 
men’s basketball team hopes to 
avoid a similar dropoff when — 
and if — it resumes play. Despite 
not having any positive tests 
of their own, the Wolverines 
are currently in the midst 
of a 14-day shut down after 
the novel B.1.1.7 strain was 
detected 
within 
Michigan’s 

athletic department. 

Regardless of whether the 

Wolverines’ stoppage is slightly 
misplaced, the interruption is 
just another example of how 
the pandemic has disrupted 
college 
basketball’s 
regular 

season. 

“I get our report every 

morning on our drug tests,” 
Wright 
told 
reporters 
on 

Wednesday. 
“(Director 
of 

Program 
Administration 

Arleshia 
Davidson) 
usually 

texts me ‘All negative’ with all 
smiley faces and I send back 
prayer signs. 

“But 
if 
she 
calls 
me, 

I’m telling you my heart’s 
pounding.”

Colorado coach Tad Boyle 

summed it up well earlier this 
year: “You live day by day, 
sometimes hour by hour.”

Villanova 
and 
the 

Wolverines have not been the 
only ranked programs with 
multi-week interruptions. In 
early December, the Buffaloes 
paused basketball operations 

after starting the season 2-0. 
Clemson, which was 9-1 and 
ranked in the top-25 at the 
time, had to postpone games 
against 
North 
Carolina 
and 

Syracuse due to cases within the 
Tigers’ program. 

“It’s frustrating a little bit, 

certainly,” 
Clemson 
coach 

Brad Brownell said at the time. 

“More 
disappointing. 
… 
We 

were coming off a great win, 
and we were just excited to go 
to Chapel Hill and play North 
Carolina. Our kids were really 
disappointed on Friday when we 
took them off the court and said, 
‘Hey, we can’t go.’

“Guys are playing well and 

they want to play. When you 
have rhythm and you’re in a good 
space, that’s when you want to 
keep playing. If things aren’t 
going well, maybe a pause can 
be good for you. So, this will be 
a test for us.” 

The Tigers lost their first 

three games upon returning 
to the court by a combined 72 
points. 

So far, the way teams have 

responded to prolonged breaks 
has proven to be a mixed bag. 
From the very start though, 
many 
coaches, 
like 
Wright 

and Michigan coach Juwan 
Howard, have emphasized the 
importance of player safety. 
Now more than ever, how 
players fare off the court takes 
precedence over how they fare 

on it. That’s just the reality 
of playing basketball during a 
pandemic. 

“For us, this year, titles and 

things like that aren’t really 
going to carry much weight,” 
Wright said. “We want these 
guys to stay mentally healthy, 
physically 
healthy 
and 
get 

through as many games as they 
can. … Everybody’s just trying to 
do their best.”

Barring another stoppage, the 

Wolverines can return to the 
court on Feb. 7. In the meantime, 
Howard will hope his red-hot 
team can come out unscathed 
and undeterred on the other end. 
At the very least, he can look 
around the country and realize 
he’s not alone. 

“So much of it comes down 

to what the doctors let them do 
during quarantine and where 
your team is,” Wright said. “... 
Usually it’s all about the team, 
but this year it’s about each guy 
individually and where they are. 

“I’m sure Juwan knows his 

guys and is going to do a great 
job.”

The Michigan baseball team 

still faces several unknowns, 
like when its season will start 
and how many games it will 
play, but its coaching staff is 
now locked in.

Two coaching jobs became 

open when former pitching coach 
Chris Fetter took a pitching coach 
position with the Detroit Tigers 
and former volunteer assistant 
Ako Thomas took a coaching 
job with the Red Sox Double-A 
affiliate. Michigan coach Erik 
Bakich officially filled them last 
Friday, when the team announced 
that Steve Merriman, who was 
the pitching coach at Michigan in 
2002 and 2012, will take over as 
pitching coach and Brandon Inge 
as volunteer assistant. Both have 
decades of baseball experience as 
well as expertise in the use and 
application of technology and 
data in coaching. 

As part of a diligent search 

process that included a month 
and a half of research, Bakich 
called Merriman for his advice 
on who would be a good 
fit to succeed Fetter. Given 
Merriman’s 
position, 
Bakich 

assumed a return to Ann Arbor 
was unlikely. 

At the time, Merriman — “a 

leading voice in modern training 
methodologies and data-enhanced 
coaching,” according to mlb.com’s 
Thomas Harding — was the minor 
league pitching co-coordinator 
of the Colorado Rockies, and 
Bakich thought he was on the 
“fast track” to a coaching position 
at the mothership. He already 
had 
experience 
coaching 
at 

the major league level: in early 
2020, Merriman helped create 
and operate a pitching lab at 
the 
Rockies’ 
spring 
training 

facility, where he used Rapsodo 
technologies to analyze Rockies’ 
starters. 

“So when he said that he 

would have interest, I was so 
excited, because he was one 
of those no-brainer type of 
candidates,” Bakich said. 

Merriman was among the 

three final candidates, each of 
whom met with players in Zoom 
meetings. 

“He had a little bit of a 

unique approach,” Bakich said. 
“Instead of putting together 
some type of PowerPoint with 
a bunch of information, he 
just took a few minutes in the 
beginning of the call with each 
guy to get to know them and 
ask them questions. A really 
personal touch, and they really 
appreciated that.

“Starting about 12 minutes 

in, I got the first text that this 
is our guy. And by the end of 
the Zoom call, all of them were 
just thrilled at the opportunity 
to potentially work with coach 
Merriman.”

In addition to his skills 

in 
cutting-edge 
coaching 

techniques, Merriman has other 
qualities that Bakich wants in 
his pitching coach. Merriman 
is renowned for his skills as a 
communicator, for example.

“If I have questions, he can 

relay the information in a way I 
understand it,” Rockies’ starter 
Jon Gray said in an interview 
with mlb.com.

Merriman will play a vital 

in-game role, too, creating game 
plans and calling pitches. Bakich 
said 
Merriman’s 
experience 

as a pitching coach and scout 
will help him attack opposing 
hitters’ weaknesses and develop 
his pitchers’ strengths. 

***
To stay at the game’s highest 

level for 13 years, Brandon Inge 
had to do “all the little things,” 
Bakich said. 

He was a super-utility player, 

a Swiss Army knife who played 
every position besides pitcher 
(although he threw gas as a 
closer in college). He was equally 
versatile on offense, hitting for 
average (0.287 in 2004), power 
(27 homers in 2006 and 2009) 
and stealing bases (nine in 
2007). 

Bakich got to know Inge 

when the two worked together 
to 
chair 
the 
ChadTough 

Foundation Gala last May. 

“I was super impressed in 

these 
planning 
committees 

for the event of what a good 
dude he is,” Bakich said. “He’s 
so generous with his time in 
serving the community that he’s 
a part of.”

The financial security from a 

long and lucrative career made 
Inge an even more attractive 
candidate for the largely unpaid 
position, especially given that 
the COVID-19 pandemic would 
make finding a second job for 
a 
volunteer 
assistant 
more 

difficult. But Bakich said that 
even without a pandemic, Inge 
would be his first choice for the 
opening. 

“Maybe the best thing about 

him is that he’s one of those 
old school throwback, tough, 
competitive, gritty types of 
guys, a ‘put your nose in the dirt 
and get it done’ kind of guy,” 
Bakich (who’s considered to be 
one of those types as well) said. 
“You can tell if you were one of 
his teammates, you’d love being 
on his team. And if you weren’t, 
you probably didn’t like playing 
against him.”

Inge may be an old-school guy, 

but he’s embraced new-school 
coaching methods. Like the rest 
of the Michigan coaching staff, 
he holds a certification from the 
Titleist Performance Institute. 
He’s especially knowledgeable 
about the physiology of hitting.

He’ll mainly work with the 

catchers but will also assist 
assistant 
head 
coach 
Nick 

Schnabel in coaching the hitters. 

“He can throw BP all day 

long,” Bakich said. “And the 
information he has regarding 
hitting is extremely valuable, 
being a guy who’s reinvented 
his swing and has a lot of 
great ideas on what type of 
approaches to certain pitchers 
will help.”

Both coaches have made large 

contributions in their first few 
weeks on the job. 

“(Merriman) 
is 
seeing 

efficient movement patterns in 
guys, and some limitations that 
they may have physically, and 
creating corrections to make 
their delivery or certain pitches 
just a little bit better,” Bakich 
said. 

And 
Inge 
noticed 
some 

pitchers 
accidentally 
tipping 

their pitches during a scrimmage 
before the athletic department’s 
two-week shutdown. 

“I’m just glad both those guys 

are on our team,” Bakich said.

How coaches around the country dealt with their own COVID-19 outbreaks

A 
deconditioning 
cycle 

like the Michigan swim and 
dive teams’ will experience 
during 
the 
University’s 

14-day 
freeze 
on 
athletics 

could set the Wolverines back 
significantly after weeks of 
heavy training. For the seniors 
who already lost an NCAA 
Championship appearance last 
year, that deconditioning could 
jeopardize their last shot.

The suspension of athletics 

means the Wolverines will be 
limited to exercises they can 
conduct under quarantine. 
No gyms. No weight rooms. 
No pools.

That shift in conditioning 

poses a huge problem as both 
Michigan 
squads 
look 
to 

complete their seasons. With 
dual meets against Ohio State 
postponed and the Big Ten 
Championship 
looming 
on 

the horizon, the pause puts 
a premium on Michigan’s 
remaining time.

“At 
this 
point, 
every 

training session counts, and 
any more lost time will lead to 
more losses in fitness and thus 
more losses in performance,” 
Dr. Adam Lepley, a School 
of 
Kinesiology 
assistant 

professor, told The Daily in 
an email. “That is also not 
to 
mention 
any 
potential 

injuries suffered due to an 
accelerated 
timeline 
and 

training 
schedule, 
which 

could set individuals back 
further.”

Lepley 
explained 
that 

cardiovascular fitness levels 
can decline in just a few 
days, let alone a 14-day span. 
However, the fitness level 
of the athletes before the 
pause could be their saving 
grace from cardiovascular 
deconditioning, 
which 

affects 
everything 
from 

oxygen usage to the amount 
of blood pumped by one 
contraction.

Once the pause is over, the 

No. 5 women’s swim and dive 
team and the divers of the No. 
9 men’s squad will have less 
than 17 days to prepare before 

they travel to their respective 
conference 
championship 

locations on Feb. 24. With a 
few more days to prepare, the 
men’s swimmers will race to 
defend a Big Ten title they 
earned last season on Mar. 3.

It could prove difficult 

for the teams to get back 
into 
optimal 
shape 
even 

if 
everything 
goes 
well. 

This assumes that the team 
will work taper time into 
its 
schedule 
to 
improve 

its chances at the Big Ten 
Championship, a three-horse 
race 
between 
Michigan, 

Indiana and Ohio State.

The postponed double date 

with the Buckeyes’ swim and 
dive teams could find itself 
played out somewhere in that 
17-day span, too. While there 
have been no announcements 
of cancellation, the Wolverines 
might have trouble fitting that 
into their possibly chaotic 
return to practice.

If those dual meets are 

canceled, 
Michigan 
could 

miss out on a key scouting op 
before everything’s on the 
line.

If the Wolverines’ backs 

weren’t already against the 
wall with the density of their 
schedule, the teams could 
find 
their 
reconditioning 

time slashed even further 
should the University extend 
the pause.

The Wolverines’ cycles of 

heavy training before the 
quarantine could lessen their 
likely losses coming out of the 
freeze, easing the physical 
challenges and allowing the 
team to recover its progress.

But 
training 
hurdles 

aren’t the only barriers the 
Wolverines will need to jump. 
After months of dedicated 
work, the Wolverines will 
have ample time to ponder 
their situation before the 
championship marathon.

“Mentally, it’s way more 

difficult,” 
men’s 
swim 

alumnus Felix Auböck said. 
“(A 14-day pause) has never 
been done before the biggest 
meet.”

The constant testing of 

Michigan’s 
perseverance 

could prove helpful down 
the 
stretch 
as 
younger 

Wolverines near their final 
meets.

“(The pause) is one of the 

biggest challenges they will 
face in their college career,” 
Auböck said. “They will come 
out of it stronger.”

But for those whose college 

careers end with this season, 
the championship sequence 
could serve as a farewell tour.

Seniors 
whose 
NCAA 

Championship 
hopes 
were 

dashed with the cancellation 
of the NCAA meet last March 
now find their final chances 
threatened by the effects of 
the pause, including Ross 
Todd, 
Gus 
Borges, 
Daria 

Pyshnenko and Will Roberts.

Pyshnenko, a 10-time All-

American, 
won 
multiple 

events 
for 
the 
women’s 

team already this season. 
Her times, though, have not 
broken the plane to enter 
the 
NCAA 
Championship, 

dictated by making the “A” 
or “B” cut times to get a 
spot in each race because 
the 
training 
regimen 
for 

swimming was built towards 
getting faster as the season 
progresses. 
The 
Big 
Ten 

Championship could be her 
only opportunity to qualify, 
adding extra meaning to her 
performance coming out of 
quarantine.

On the diving side, Todd 

has already met the NCAA 
standards 
in 
the 
1 
and 

3-meter 
dives. 
However, 

the two-week gap could add 
difficulty to repeating his Big 
Ten Championship success of 
last season, a meet in which 
he earned Co-Diver of the 
Championships honors.

Not everyone is pessimistic, 

however. The break could 
only add coal to the fire that 
has fueled the Wolverines all 
season.

“(Borges 
and 
Todd) 

will be fine,” Auböck said. 
“They are so experienced 
and 
world-class 
athletes. 

Especially Ross in diving 
is a perfectionist. It should 
not be a problem for them to 
qualify.”

Michigan lacrosse: The Club Years

As a Midwestern youth in the 

1980s, John Paul was one of the 

few in Ann Arbor to be fascinated 

by the sport of lacrosse. And what 

started out as a backyard game 

for Paul to play with his friends 

became a collegiate commitment, a 

professional career and, above all, 

an unparalleled lifelong passion.

The first time John Paul tried to 

start a lacrosse program, he was shot 

down. In the early 1980s, Paul was a 

student at Pioneer High School in Ann 

Arbor. Like most athletic, Midwest-

ern teenagers of his decade, he spent 

his after-school hours playing football 

in the fall and basketball in the winter.

Paul’s spring seasons were always 

unfilled, though. Paul knew about 

lacrosse and casually played from 

time to time. He grew up with the 

sons of fabled Michigan club lacrosse 

coach Bob DiGiovanni, who revived 

the previously defunct program with 

his friends in 1965 and intermittently 

coached the team in the 1970s. But 

playing the game competitively was 

never an option for Paul growing 

up. Pioneer — like most high schools 

west of the Appalachians at the time 

— didn’t have a program for the tradi-

tionally East Coast sport, and the high 

school’s athletic department reject-

ed his attempt to field his own team.

So when Paul weighed his options 

for college, he knew he wanted to go 

somewhere he could play lacrosse. 

Albion College, less than an hour 

from Ann Arbor, had a student-run 

club team of its own, and when 

Paul enrolled in the fall of 1984, 

he jumped at the opportunity to 

play and took to the sport quickly.

Paul ultimately left Albion after 

two years due to academic struggles 

and returned to work in Ann Arbor 

from 1986 to 1990, taking classes 

at Washtenaw Community Col-

lege while he regained his bearings.

Meanwhile, Paul kept up with 

lacrosse by playing for Michigan’s 

club team. At the time, non-stu-

dents were allowed to play for the 

University’s club sports teams, so 

the roster was mostly made up of 

young Ann Arbor residents like 

Paul, as well as graduate students.

DiGiovanni, who became Michi-

gan’s full-time head coach a year prior 

to Paul’s arrival, was committed to 

changing the tone of the program by 

upping the level of accountability and 

enlisting undergraduates who would 

bring it to new heights. As a three-

year captain during this period, Paul 

served as a key leader who set the 

bar for the newer, younger players.

“Like any older player, (I was) 

just at that time leading by show-

ing them what it took to be good at 

what you do,” Paul said. “It was try-

ing to do things the right way and 

hoping that others would follow.”

After a year-long stint with the 

Detroit Turbos of the Major Indoor 

Lacrosse League (rebranded as 

the National Lacrosse League in 

1997), Paul returned to Michigan 

in 1992, this time as an admit-

ted student, where he finished his 

bachelor’s degree and played one 

last season with the Wolverines.

Following 
graduation, 
Paul 

secured a fundraising position in 

the Michigan athletic department, 

which he held for four years before 

transitioning to an adjacent role in 

the university’s College of Litera-

ture, Science & the Arts. For the first 

time in a while, things were steady 

for Paul. He had recently married 

his wife, Lisa, was happily settled in 

the town he grew up in and had a job 

working for an institution he loved. 

It appeared as if he was content. But 

then an opportunity came knocking.

After 
serving 
as 
Michigan’s 

head coach for 12 years and lead-

ing the Wolverines to an impres-

sive 
198-54 
record, 
DiGiovanni 

retired in 1997. The team’s rising 

seniors asked Paul to fill the void 

for the upcoming 1998 season.

Paul had some coaching experi-

ence, but not a ton. Back in 1990, Pio-

neer finally added a lacrosse program, 

six years after Paul’s original plea, and 

appointed DiGiovanni to the helm 

while he kept his post at Michigan. 

Helping his coach out, Paul acted as 

the Pioneers’ junior varsity coach 

and assistant varsity coach when he 

was still playing for the Wolverines. 

His involvement had waned since he 

graduated from Michigan, though.

Cautiously, Paul agreed to the 

seniors’ request under the assumption 

that his affiliation with the position 

would be temporary and part time. 

A year later, Paul found himself quit-

ting his office job in LSA to become 

the Wolverines’ full-time head coach.

“I just had such a great time doing 

it and I had this vision for making 

it more and more,” Paul said. “I just 

wanted to make the club program 

as good as it could be. So it came to a 

point where I was devoting so much 

time to that, my regular work was 

suffering and I had to make a choice. 

And I just liked (coaching) more.”

As it did for him as a player, Mich-

igan lacrosse — the brotherhood, 

the endless grind, the experience 

and camaraderie of it all — had cap-

tured his heart as a coach. And it 

wouldn’t let go for quite some time.

***

As it turned out, Paul was the 

perfect person to take the reins from 

DiGiovanni. For Paul, growing up 

in Ann Arbor and surrounded by 

the University gave him an utmost 

reverence for the Block “M” and the 

values of hard work, determination 

and enthusiasm that he felt it rep-

resented. His desire to showcase 

Michigan in its purest form culmi-

nated in a rich intensity and passion 

that he brought to the program from 

the get-go. And in terms of building 

a strong team culture, Paul made 

sure that a similar mindset mani-

fested itself in his players, his staff 

and even his eventual successor.

“I think when you have some-

one who’s lived it their entire life 

like coach Paul, he understood what 

Michigan was,” current Wolverines’ 

head coach Kevin Conry said. “It was 

ingrained in our program, so that 

the guys came in and they under-

stood, although we are relatively 

young as a program, this universi-

ty — this athletic department — has 

been around for so long and has had 

so many legends come through it.”

Upon taking the head coaching 

role, everything Paul had — money, 

time and energy — went towards 

Michigan club lacrosse. He never 

took a paycheck, even forgoing the 

proceeds from a youth lacrosse 

camp he ran every summer, instead 

putting all of his meager club sports 

coach earnings back into the team. 

This was not without sacrifice, 

not only for Paul, but also for Lisa, 

whose income the newlywed cou-

ple was solely relying on to get by.

On 
the 
lacrosse 
field, 
such 

immense commitment paid off. From 

1998 to 2006, he led the Wolverines 

to a compelling 152-37 record. Mich-

igan was among the best teams in the 

Men’s Collegiate Lacrosse Associa-

tion, the highest division of collegiate 

club lacrosse, making its way to the 

MCLA Tournaments quarterfinals 

eight of the nine seasons and advanc-

ing as far as the semifinals in 2005.

In 2007, though, the fourth-seed-

ed Wolverines suffered a major upset 

when they were blown out by No. 13 

seed Northeastern in the first round 

of the MCLA Tournament, 15-4.

The loss shocked Paul and his 

players’ systems. “We had never 

lost in the first round,” Paul said.

But after nearly a decade of glid-

ing at an above-average — yet not 

quite championship-caliber — level 

of play, the loss offered a silver lin-

ing. It allowed Michigan to step 

back, evaluate its progress as a 

program thus far and understand 

what it would take to climb the next 

rung on the ladder to excellence. 

“We were at this crossroads,” 

Paul said. “We had always been 

this team that was highly ranked 

but never got it done. When you’re 

doing that year after year after year, 

that’s culture. And so we knew we 

kinda had to blow everything up and 

completely rethink the culture if we 

were gonna make the next step.” 

That offseason, Paul met with 

the rising seniors to discuss the 

future trajectory of the program. 

He had plans to make some big 

changes, mostly elevating the level 

of intensity and overall commit-

ment, but he was worried that his 

ambitions did not match his players.

“I know they wanted to win, 

but there’s a big price to pay to do 

that, especially at the club level 

where you’re paying to play and 

there 
aren’t 
those 
expectations 

and 
accountability,” 
Paul 
said.

But 
the 
seniors 
accepted 
Paul’s 
chal-

lenge. In that moment, they bought 

in and set forth to change course. 

“We were building it to be the 

best club program ever,” Paul said. 

“That’s what we wanted to be.”

***

While it may seem frivolous for a 

coach and group of players to declare 

that they are suddenly going to rise 

to the top of the ranks of their sport, 

that sort of confidence made all the 

difference for incoming freshmen like 

Trevor Yealy prior to the 2008 season.

Although Yealy’s decision to attend 

Michigan was primarily driven by 

his interest in the University’s aero-

nautical engineering program, as 

someone who was deciding wheth-

er to play Division I or club lacrosse 

in college, he was drawn to the fact 

that the Wolverines took themselves 

seriously despite being a club team.

“I think it was those guys kinda 

setting the tone on how this pro-

gram was going to be run and how, 

from a player perspective, we were 

going to conduct ourselves,” Yealy 

said. “(Those guys took) a step for-

ward so that when my class (got) 

to Ann Arbor freshman year, we 

got a group of seniors who fully 

bought in and committed and had 

gotten the kids who were already 

there, the sophomores and juniors, 

fully bought in and committed.

“I didn’t really know any other way 

at Michigan aside from being fully 

bought in and committed to the vision 

of being an excellent program, because 

those seniors set that foundation.” 

A new standard had been codified.

In order to elevate its game, 

Michigan trained as if it were a var-

sity program, holding early morning 

lifting sessions and night practices 

four days a week in preparation for 

games on weekends. With a $1 mil-

lion annual budget, a benefit of addi-

tional sponsorships and donations 

the Wolverines had recently received, 

they were fortunate enough to have 

the financial bandwidth to do so.

“As a club team we practiced 

with incredible tempo,” Paul said. 

“I mean, our practices were brutal.”

Added Yealy: “This was not your 

traditional club sport, where maybe 

you go play for a couple hours and 

then roll out a keg onto the field after. 

It was treated very seriously, very 

much like a varsity sport. If you did not 

abide by the team rules and whatnot, 

that was it, you were off the team.”

To get some coaching help, Paul 

brought in Ken Broschart — an old 

friend who had previously run a suc-

cessful club program of his own at 

Arizona. According to Paul, as a gritty 

blue-collar Long Islander, Broschart 

brought a unique blend of tough-

ness and lacrosse intelligence that 

added positive value to the team, as 

well as Paul’s own coaching abilities. 

Michigan reaped the benefits 

of its metamorphosis immediately.

In 2008, the Wolverines went 

undefeated in the regular season, 

something no other MCLA team 

had ever done before. Entering as 

the No. 1 seed in the MCLA Tour-

nament, Michigan tore through 

its opponents in the early rounds 

before defeating No. 2 Chapman 

in the championship game, 14-11, 

to secure its first MCLA title.

The Wolverines continued their 

reign into 2009 and 2010, notch-

ing a cumulative 38-1 record over 

that stretch en route to their sec-

ond- 
and 
third-straight 
titles.

What 
Michigan 
accomplished 

over such a brief period was 

nothing short of history. For the 

majority of these three years, the 

Wolverines sat untouched at No. 1 

in the MCLA rankings. Spanning 

from the end of the 2007 season to 

the midpoint of 2010, the Wolver-

ines won 50 consecutive games.

Just as Paul and his seniors had 

set out to do in the summer of 2007, 

Michigan had quickly become one 

of the best club programs ever, and 

it showed little signs of wavering 

anytime soon. Division I coaches 

glanced at the Wolverines and were 

utterly impressed with what Paul 

had built, while club coaches des-

perately tried to figure out how to 

emulate it. For players like Yealy, 

who were now wrapping up their 

junior years, winning was the norm.

It appeared, once again, as if Paul 

was content. “I never really had long-

term goals for the program,” Paul said. 

“When we were changing the culture 

of the club program, it wasn’t neces-

sarily about winning national cham-

pionships. It certainly wasn’t about 

becoming varsity. It was just about 

being really excellent and trying to fig-

ure out how to do that better the next 

day than we did that day. That was it.”

But 
then, 
once 
again, 
an 

opportunity 
came 
knocking.

***

While 
Paul 
had 
certainly 

dreamed and talked of his program 

one day turning Division I, it was 

never a priority for him. He knew 

the answer would always be no.

“I knew (then-Michigan athletic 

director) Bill Martin pretty well, and 

I didn’t bug him about wanting to be 

varsity, because I knew what he’d say 

and I didn’t want to lose his support 

for what we were doing,” Paul said. 

“I knew bugging him about varsity 

would just piss him off, so I didn’t. 

I thought we’d never be varsity.”

Added Yealy: “Previous athletic 

directors had no interest. Rightful-

ly so, big football, basketball, hock-

ey school, they (had) their time 

plenty spent dealing with those 

sports, so adding lacrosse prob-

ably wasn’t high on their radar.”

As a result, Paul just focused 

on building the best possible club 

team that he could, so in the event 

that, one day, should his circum-

stances change, he was ready.

That day had come. On Jan. 5, 2010, 

then-Michigan president Mary Sue 

Coleman announced that Dave Bran-

don would serve as the University’s 

next athletic director following the 

retirement of Martin, who had served 

in the role for the previous 10 years.

As the former CEO of Domino’s 

and a Wolverines’ football alum, 

Brandon came to the Michigan ath-

letic department with an entrepre-

neurial spirit and sense of school 

pride that propelled him through-

out his tenure from 2010 to 2014.

Paul thought it was worth a shot 

to send a proposal to the athletic 

department detailing why Michigan 

club lacrosse should be promoted to 

varsity status. If anyone was going 

to take a chance on a new, excit-

ing opportunity, it was Brandon.

Fortunately for Paul, the stars 

were aligned in his favor. At the 

time, lacrosse was the fastest grow-

ing sport in the country, so invest-

ing in a Division I program would 

ensure that an athletic powerhouse 

like Michigan was a part of the latest 

and greatest wave in sports. Paul’s 

squad had also clearly proven itself 

to be the best club program in the 

country at the time, so it made sense 

for the Wolverines to want to take 

the next step at the varsity level.

Paul 
was 
still 
surprised, 

though, when Brandon respond-

ed positively to the proposal.

“He was like, ‘I already know I 

want to do this, I just don’t know 

if I can,’ ” Paul said. “He needed 

a few months to figure it out and 

then came back to me and said, ‘If 

we can get over all the hurdles that 

the University is going to put in 

front of us, we’re gonna do this.’ ”

To make Paul’s vision a reali-

ty, he and Brandon would have to 

fundraise $5 million. The quanti-

ty of money was merely symbolic; 

$5 million doesn’t go very far for a 

modern Big Ten athletic program 

in terms of scholarships, facilities 

and equipment, but University 

officials wanted to see some com-

mitment and have some cushion 

before approving the promotion.

While Brandon and the athletic 

department primarily handled the 

accounting and logistics behind 

fundraising, Paul sold the idea. Not 

only did he have experience work-

ing with donors from his old work 

in the athletic department and LSA, 

he was also still quite close with 

club alumni, who he knew would 

be 
interested 
in 
contributing.
