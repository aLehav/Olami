Leaders call
for inclusivity
in speeches

Ceremony highlights
importance of
campus dialogue
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily News Editor
Following a year when ques-
tions of diversity, climate and
accessibility reshaped campus
conversation and challenged the
University community to take a
hard look at itself and its policies,
University President Mark Schlis-
i sel used his inaugural address
Friday to articulate his vision for
a University marked by inclusion.
In the Hill Auditorium cere-
mony that officially installed him
as the University's 14th president,
Schlissel delivered a set of pre-
pared remarks that minced few
words in pinpointing accessibility
as one of the institution's greatest
challenges.
"Michigan's house must be big
and its doors open wide," he said.
Though new leaders often
employ inaugural speeches to lay
out new policies or initiatives,
Schlissel used the podium to eval-
uate the University's priorities.
He cited three central prin-
ciples guiding this vision for the
University: embrace the Universi-
ty's mission as a public institution,
ensure the University is a diverse

and democratic community and
promote the value of all voices.
"I firmly believe that we cannot
achieve true excellence without
leveraging the experiences and
perspectives of the broadest pos-
sible diversity of students, faculty
and staff," he said. "This is chal-
lenging work. Not only building a
diverse student body, but also cre-
ating an inclusive campus climate
that is open to difficult discourse."
Though Schlissel spoke about
diversity and access in general
terms, his decision to devote
extensive space to the topic was
evidence of University's continued
struggle to grow minority enroll-
ment and address concerns about
campus climate.
Last year, the University's
Black Student Union launched
the #BBUM Twitter campaign to
call attention to the experience
of Black students on campus. The
initiative drew national coverage
and prompted the University to
consider action on a wide spec-
trum of issues, includingtroubling
enrollment numbers for minority
students.
The University has also found
it difficult to shake the view that.
it's a place most accessible to those
with privileged socio-economic
status.
In his speech, Schlissel recalled
returning home every weekend

Students, faculty and admin-

he was formally installed as the
University's 14th president.
With speeches from Repub-
lican Gov. Rick Snyder; Univer-

Ruth Simmons, Brown Uni-
versity president emerita; and
Schlissel himself, the inaugura-
tion focused on the significant
issues facing modern public
higher education.
In his inaugural address,
Schlissel articulated his vision

for a University community
marked by inclusiveness, acces-
sibility and a vibrant civil
exchange of diverse viewpoints.
"I firmly believe that we
cannot achieve true excellence
without leveraging the experi-
ences and perspectives of the
broadest possible diversity of

Schlissel said. "This is chal-

Despite delivering a clear
promise to aggressively pursue
an agenda of inclusion, Schlis-
sel said the process of exploring
the University he now leads in
ongoing.
"I am walking in new direc-
tions, and I am asking a lot of
questions," Schlissel said. "I

'U'considers woman's advocate
Forty years ago this week Twenty yearsago this week Fourteen years ago this week
(September 11, 1974) (September 8,1994) (September 12,2000)

The University re-opened the
post of woman's advocate, a post
previously closed because the
last advocate left the position for
"personal reasons."
The re-opening followed much
debate over whether the Univer-
sity still needed an advocate for
women, leading to a lengthy re-
evaluation of the position.
The Office of Special Ser-
vices and Programs launched
an 11-member search commit-
tee appointed by OSSP director
Libby Davenport. At the date of
the article, the team was already
sifting through more than 50
applications.

Following an alleged sexual
assault inside of the Michi-
gan Union, building officials
announced their plan to re-evalu-
ate the entrance policy and over-
all safety.
Many students expressed fear
over the standing policy, specifical-
ly whenallowingnon-studentsinto
the building, as both the survivor
and alleged perpetrator were not
affiliated with the University.
In response, the University
implemented more I.D. checks
at night and checks on "people
that look like they don't belong,"
James Smiley, Department of
Public Safety captain, said.

Howard King, a prominent
attorney for many music icons,
including Dr. Dre and Metallica,
asked the University to restrict
access to the notorious file-shar-
ing site, napster.com.
King also asked 10 other uni-
versities to also restrict access to
students to avoid potential copy-
right law infringement.
Napster CEO Hank Barry
urged students not to listen to
King as they are not liable for
.potential illegal action.
"Students who engage in per-
son-to-person file sharing are not
copyright infringers," Barry said.

MHACKS
From Page 1A
future," according to the
event's website.
The 36-hour Hackathon,
where roughly 1,000 students
neglected sleep and, at points,
personal hygiene in the name of
creating hard and software, ran
this weekend: Sept. 5-7.
Last year's MHacks event cen-
tered on Detroit. Information
sophomore Vikram Rajagopa-
lan, the director of MHacks, said
prior to the event this Hackathon
would have alearningfocus.
"We are really focusing on
learning - not in watching a
course, but learning by doing," he
said. "We're gonna have Oculus
Rifts. We're gonna have a Tesla.
Similar to before, we're giving
people awesome new technol-
ogy and a chance to play with the
technology you haven't played
with before and build something

awesome with it."
With this in mind, it's not sur-
prising that there were a smat-
tering of high school students
in attendance. One of these was
Cole Hudson, a ninth grader at
Fremont High School. His moth-
er drove him to the Hackathon
from their small town in western
Michigan.
"I'm here to learn," Hudson
said. "Experience, I guess, is
what I'm looking to get out of
this experience. I mean, I've
never been around nearly this
many people interested in com-
puter programming. It's just
awesome to be around this
much creativity and just to be
able to pick up a little bit of that
would be cool."
Sponsor representatives, rang-
ing from Facebook to Chrysler,
stand behind booths, offering free
merchandise, encouraging engi-
neers to use their programming
interfaces and talkingto students
interested in internships.
Engineeringsophomore Daniel

Kim won the first place accolade,
which included a Dell tablet and
$4,000. He led a project called
Power Glove, which expanded
the capabilities of a preexisting
simulation video game called
Surgeon Simulator 2013.
As its name might suggest, the
game allows users to simulate
surgery by controlling the doc-
tor's hand with keyboard func-
tions. Kim's twist: there's no need
for an external keyboard.
He used a so-called "inven-
tion kit" called MaKey MaKey,
a device that allows household
objects to be converted into
touchpads. Power Glove uses a
digital hand to follow his own
movements exactly, including
even the flexing of individual fin-
gers.
"I never expected this," Kim
said of winning the competition.
"During the expo, I was just hav-
ing a good time. When I got a call
to (be in the top 14), I was like,
'Damn, did I break a rule or some-
thing?".

The other creations in the
top three included Android for
iPhone, an app to run Android
operations on iPhones, and
Smash Connect, which detects a
user's movements and translates
them into attacks in the classic
Nintendo 64 game, Super Smash
Bros.
Another finalist included an
app called Spudy, "your speedy
reading buddy," which allows
users to take pictures of text
from books, eliminate extrane-
ous images or figures and quickly
convert the passages into word-
by-word plaintext for easy, more
efficient reading.
There were, of course, hun-
dreds of projects that did not
make the top 14.
One, created by a group of
sophomores from Carnegie Mel-
lon University, involved the use
of floppy disks to make an instru-
ment. The disks emit a noise
when activated; the team aimed
to control both the timing and the
pitch of the disks to form what

would be a21st century piano.
Another project, pioneered by
Engineering junior Jennings Jin,
was originally called Crapp (the
crap app). Users take inventory of
items they no longer use, measur-
ing the number of items and their
collective weight and cost.
At the time of his interview, Jin
said he was "in the farting stage
of Crapp," which he had come up
with at 2 a.m. that morning. He
decided to rename the project
Heapp.
As to how he and friends had
generated the idea: "It's just like
an, 'Eh, why not?'."
Engineering juniors Connor
Grieb and Jake Glass designed
an app based on their passion
for skiing and called it "Rusty
the Local." The project assumed
the role of a local mountain man
on the slopes, and allowed users
to denote particularly good or
bad parts of a given ski trail and
broadcast them to fellow skiers,
among other functions.
Grieb and Glass each slept

around six hours during the
36-hour event, remedied in part
by the consumption of caffein-
ated brownies. A lack of rest was
common among the weekend's
hackers.
The Hackathon also featured
guest speakers ranging from Red-
dit Co-founder Alexis Ohbnian to
Grace Choi, founder of Mink, a 3D
makeup printing company.
The keynote speaker at the
event's ending in Rackham Audi-
torium was John Maeda, the for-
mer president of the Rhode Island
School of Design.
Maeda told students to
remember the importance of
their work rather than worry-
ing about more trivial matters,
namely money.
"Try not to forget that you are
part of a grand mission where
technologists, designers, people
like yourselves are shaping cul-
ture in a way that can be hugely
positive or hugely negative,
depending on the choices you
make," he said.

STORM
From Page 1A
across the state. A severe
stormwarning for the Ann Arbor
area, cautioning of 70-plus hour
wind, was issued Friday eve-
ning. Wind speeds reached 50
miles per hour in Ann Arbor, and
up to 70 miles per hour in other
areas of Southeast Michigan,
according to a CBS report.
Dixon said on Sunday after-
noon that most affected areas
should have power by Monday
evening.
"The vast majority of outages
we expect to be taken care of by
the end of tomorrow evening,"

Dixon said. "However, there will
be small clusters of customers
with individual service prob-
lems until Tuesday or Wednes-
day."
LSA sophomore Sagar Sada-
sivan, a Sybil resident who lost
power, said the loss has been
inconvenient, though the mild
weather dampens the effect.
"The only thing is it forces us
to go out of the house because
we have to charge our phones,
charge our laptops, you need
Wi-Fi for homework," he said.
"It could be worse, if the weather
was extremely hot or extremely
cold."
The water supply for LSA
junior Radhi Gohil, a South For-
est resident who also lost power,

was turned off as precautionary
measure. She said dealing with
the outage has been a confus-
ing and frustrating experience,
especially as a first-time renter.
"With school just starting,
classes getting time-consuming,
it's been a headache," she said.
"For people who it's their first
time living off campus, for some-
thing like this to happen you're
kind of at a loss for resources
and there's not really anyone you
can talk to."
Both Sadasivan and Gohil
were initially told they wouldn't
have power returned until
Thursday, but were told Sunday
that power might be returned as
soon as tonight.
Dixon said several priori-

ties influence when power is
restored. It depends on the con-
sumers' power circuit and their
power needs. For instance, hos-
pitals and police and fire stations
are likely to receive power first.
"We look to repair the circuit
that has the most customers
affected. If we can get several
thousand customers back up in
one repair, that's where we want
to focus our efforts."
Another Sybil Street resident
who lost power, Engineering
graduate student Garrett Cul-
len, said he was disappointed by
the delay.
"Understandably, (DTE) has
a lot on their plate right now,"
Cullen added. "I expected a lot
quicker service."

From Page 1A
aspirations, what they are most
proud of, and what they are anx-
ious about as we move forward
together."
Pollack, the University's pro-
vost, gave , opening remarks
welcoming the community and
introducing the University's gov-
erning Board of Regents, deans
and faculty, as well as Schlissel
and his extended family. She also
stressed the responsibility Schlis-
sel has to respond to the challeng-
es and trials facing public higher
education.
Following her speech, Snyder
noted Schlissel's eagerness to
learn, alluding to the new presi-
dent's recent trip around the state.
He added that Schlissel will serve
as the cornerstone of humanity at

the University.
"What makes the University
of Michigan a truly special place
is not one area or sectors, it is the
humanity of the University, the
people," Snyder said.
In an address that elicited
thunderous applause multiple
times, Simmons, who served as
the president of Brown Univer-
sity and appointed Schlissel it's
provost, called on universities to
devote more attention to ensuring
students leave prepared to resolve
conflict and treat others with
respect - even as theyincreasing-
ly push forward new innovations
in science and technology.
"Respect for others is a goal
worth setting and worthy of pres-
idential leadership," she said.
Regent Kathy White, who is
the chair of the Board of Regents,
outlined a history of past Univer-
sity presidents, concluding with
Schlissel's formal inauguration.

The crowd gave an overwhelming
standing ovation.
An hour before the inaugura-
tion ceremony, Schlissel joined
the regents, executive officers,
deans, faculty and representatives
from 100 other universities for a
formal robing ceremony held in
Rackham Auditorium.
In an interview with The Mich-
igan Daily during the ceremony,
Schlissel saidhewasimpressed by
the number of guests who came to
represent their university, depart-
ment or college.
"It is one of the most amaz-
ing days of my life," he said. "I'm,
humbled."
Thoughhetechnicallysassumed
the presidency in July, Schlissel
said the past week has been an
experience apart from the rest of
his time at the University.
"It really changed a lot when
the students came back to town a
few days ago," he said. "I've been

running into students all across
the campus. The energy level
went up a notch and it's just really
exciting."
However, Schlissel said there's
more he can do to become further
acquainted with the campus com-
munity.
"I have to continue my efforts
to getting to know people, getting
to know the faculty, students and
staff and what their aspirations
are and how I can add to the work
of the University to make it bet-
ter," he said.
After the ceremonial robing
process, a processional of hun-
dreds of gowned academics and
officials marched down the steps
of Rackham Auditorium and
through the Diag, ending at Hill
Auditorium.
Students and members of the
community who lined the path-
way cheered and applauded. Some
event attendees reached for mem-

bers of the processional, including
President EmeritaMary Sue Cole-
man, to snap a photo.
In the Diag, student volunteers
in maize T-shirts created a tun-
nel for the processional to walk
through. Students chanted, "It's
great to be aMichigan Wolverine"
and sangHail to the Victors.
When Schlissel exited the stu-
dent volunteer tunnel, many stu-
dents jumped at the opportunity
to give him a high five and take a
selfie.
Dozens of those participants
also took positions in a post-
inaugural community festival
set outside the auditorium. A few
hundred people gathered for Uni-
versity-sponsored food and music
set up around Ingalls Mall.
LSA sophomores Kasey Wright
and Stephanie Saravolatz served
as event volunteers earlier in the
day and helped cheer on the pro-
cessional as it passed through the

Diag.
"I am a scholarship student
here and this was something I
could do to give back to the Uni-
versity (that) has given me so
much," Wright said.
"Students started joining even
though they didn't have t-shirts
and I thought that was pretty cool
and I think everyone enjoyed it a
lot," Saravolatz said.
LSA junior Joe Murray, anoth-
er student volunteer, said he was
impressed with Schlissel's inau-
gural speech and his push for
valuing all voices, despite conflict
or disagreement.
"I would love to see him imple-
ment those ideas he talked about
as far as making sure the Univer-
sity stays really open to people
and that we seek people from
Michigan and around the country
and the world, makingsure every-
one who deserves to go here has
the opportunity to."


INCLUSIVITY
From Page 1A
as an undergraduate freshman
to work at a supermarket. Those
earnings - in concert with need-
based scholarships and student
loans - helped put him through
school. Today, he said too many
students face a more challeng-
ing climb to afford a university
education and pledged to keep
tuition affordable for all.
"Talent is uniformly .distrib-
uted across the populace," he
said. "But opportunity most cer-
tainly is not. We must encour-
age every talented high school
senior in Michigan to apply here.
Students and their parents must
hear clearly and rest secure that
the University of Michigan val-
ues curiosity and intellect, not
zip codes or family income."
According to data from the
University's Office of the Reg-
istrar, 63 percent of incom-
ing freshmen in fall 2011
reported family incomes exceed-
ing $100,000. The figure was 72
percent for nonresident students.
The median family income in the
United States is $51,324, accord-
ing to a2012 survey conducted by
the U.S. Census Bureau.
Though Schlissel cited the
University's commitmentto raise
$1 billion for financial aid as part
of the ongoing Victors for Michi-
gan development campaign,
tuition has continued to rise. LSA
in-state tuition increased by 60
percent and out-of-state tuition
by 55 percent between academic
years 2004-05 and 2013-14, due
in part to declining state support
for institutions of higher educa-
tion.
In the inauguration's keynote
speech that ignited the audi-
torium with applause, Ruth J.
Simmons, the former Brown
University president, called on
college presidents to continue
charging toward the "Great Soci-
ety" laid out by President Lyndon
Johnson in his 1964 commence-
ment address atthe University. In
that speech, Johnson called for a
renewed fight against poverty
and racial injustice that would
push America closer toward a
society "where every child can
find knowledge to enrich his
mind and to enlarge his talents."
"In our time, I see no bet-
ter site to join that battle than
universities and I see no bet-
ter generals for that battle than
university presidents," Simmons
said.
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily outside Hill
Auditorium, Simmons said, like
Schlissel, she chose to discuss
community and diversity after
this summer's tension in Fergu-
son, Mo. struck her as indicative
of the issues faced by communi-
ties across the country.
"These very fundamental
attributes of kindness and gener-
osity and respect - we give short
shrift to that - and yet when
(conflict) explodes, that's what it
comes down to."
Simmons said these challeng-

es are especially prevalent on col-
lege campuses.
"It's very hard to benefit prop-
erly from an excellent learning
environment if you're feeling
alienated, disrespected, unim-
portant," she said. "I don't have
any problem with people dis-
agreeing with me; I do have a
problem when there's nobody
there who looks at me and says I
understand that this is difficult
for you and I feel for you," she
said.
Schlissel, too, made the case
for creating a community built on
respect and dialogue, especially
amid disagreement. He cited an
incident at Brown last year when
protest prevented New York City
Police Commissioner Ray Kelly -
who pioneered the controversial
policing policy called "stop and
frisk" - from delivering astalk on
campus. Schlissel said turning
from the people we disagree with
or denying them the opportunity
to speak robs the community of
valuable learning experiences
and the chance to challenge
ideas.
"People have stood on this
very stage and voiced unsettling
opinions," he said. "Ross Barnett
was the governor of Mississippi
and a segregationist. He opposed
the civil rights legislation of the
1960s and the integration of his
state's flagship university. He
was booed here, in 1963, but he
was allowed to speak. This is
what great universities do: We
encourage all voices, no matter
how discomforting the message."
Last spring, a proposal that
asked the Central Student Gov-
ernment to support University
divestment from companies
allegedly involved in human
rights violations in Palestine
propagated tension across many
corners of campus as groups
delved into a debate that was at
times divisive.
While Schlissel didn't refer to
that controversy, he emphasized
the role of universities in encour-
aging debate that's respectful of
diverse viewpoints and a com-
munity that's open to criticism,
even when the conversation is
challenging for individuals or for
the University.
"That is why I want Michigan
to be known as a place where
mutual respect does not require
agreement, where differences of
perspective are treated with sen-
sitivity, and where we all become
advocates for, and experts in,
civil discourse."
Schlissel is not the first presi-
dent to address these issues in an
inaugural speech, though many
of those addresses devoted con-
siderably less space to the top-
ics. Toward the end of her 2003
inaugural, University President
Emerita Mary Sue Coleman
highlighted the University's
pending cases before the U.S.
Supreme Court regardingthe use
of race, among other factors, in
university admissions.
"No matter what the outcome
may be - as an institution, we
shall remain committed to the
ideal of a diversely interactive
community, dedicated to the

highest standards," Coleman
said. "If we win, we will have a
hollow victoy unless we renew
our commitment to learning
with, and learning from, diverse
others every day, in every action,
ineveryclassroom,ineveryliving
arrangement, in every research
and public service endeavor. The
nation will be looking to the Uni-
versity of Michigan for leader-
ship and inspiration, however the
decision of the Court is crafted."
Though the court ultimately
upheld part of the University's
affirmative action admissions
policy, a 2006 statewide ballot
proposal outlawed the consid-
eration ofrace in public higher
education admissions. Despite
Coleman's inaugural promises to
uphold the University's commit-
ment to diversity, Black enroll-
ment has hovered around six
percent in recent years.
James Duderstadt, who served
as the University's 11th president,
also articulated the University's
responsibility to ensure equal
opportunity in his 1988 inaugu-
ral.
"If we do not create a nation
that mobilizes the talents of all
our citizens, we are destined for
a diminished role in the global
community, increased . social
turbulence, and most tragical-
ly, we will have failed to fulfill
the promise of democracy upon
which this nation was founded,"
he said.
Still, ensuring expansive and
equitable access to the University
has proved elusive - despite the
promises of multiple presidents
who promised progress in their
inaugurals.
Though Simmons, who tapped
Schlissel to serve as her provost,
said she can't be sure how he
plans to implement the vision
established in his inaugural
speech, she said his vow to pri-
oritize diversity and dialogue is
not for show.
"Communities are not helped
by people who say one thing over
here and another over there or
who say things that are conve-
nient to be said at convenient
times," she said. "What we know
is he's not a person to do that. He
will always move in the direction
of clarity. He won't compromise
in expressing his views and that
to me is an excellent beginning."
After listening to the inaugu-
ral address, Public Policy junior
Hattie McKinney, the Black Stu-
dent Union's programming chair,
said she can tell Schlissel under-
stands the climate he's stepping
into and is ready to take the steps
necessary to create tangible
improvements.
However, she said it's a speech
that represents Schlissel's inten-
tions, and though administra-
tors often know the direction
they want to head, it's not always
achieved.
"The goals and the visions
he laid out are not an overnight
deal," McKinney said. "The pro-
cess will be ongoing. It's some-
thing he can't do alone. We'll all
have to come together to make
this vision a reality and it's going
to take time."

'El Pintor'I unsuccessful

By ADAM THEISEN
Daily Music Editor
The fact that the title of
Interpol's new record is simply
an anagram
of the band's B-
name is '-
actually an El Pintor
appropriate
metaphor Interpol
for the music Matador
itself. El Pin-
tor certainly
sounds like Interpol, minus
bassist Carlos D. and with a
few small tweaks to the group's
style. However, even though the
album features many of Inter-
pol's strengths, the pieces rare-
ly seem to fit together as they
should and it ends up sound-
ing like an inferior mish-mash
of the band's stellar classics.
El Pintor is still the Interpol
you know and (may) love, but
listen to it with its seminal
debut record Turn on the Bright
Lights still stuck in your head
after all these years and some-
thing will seem wrong.
Perhaps it's unfair to criti-
cize a band just for releasing
its best stuff too early in its
career, but Interpol doesn't
do itself any favors by stick-
ing with almost the exact style
that made it famous. Of course,
when you arrive on the scene
as fully matured as Interpol
did, it's hard to do very much
more growing, but the ghosts
of early-2000s New York City
indie rock haunt El Pintor. The
Joy Division-esque bass is still
turned all the way up, guitars
continue to drone and screech,
and Paul Banks's chilly moan of
a voice remains - which I sup-
pose is great if Interpol is your
favorite band. But Interpol's
brand of melancholy rock needs
all of its parts to be perfectly
executed to avoid being grating,
and unfortunately, there are too
many missteps on El Pintor.

That's not to say there aren't guitar part just noodles off on

Sunday was not Snyder's first
event at a STEM-related event at
the University. In 2013, Snyder
delivered the keynote address at
the University's Robotics Day,
which was sponsored by FIRST-
For Inspiration and Recognition
of Science and Technology. This
past June, he hosted the winners
of the state's high school robotics
competition held by FIRST as he
signed his education budget for
fiscal year 2015
The $05.8 billion education
budget for next year includes $2
million in grants for the robotics
program, but the Govemor hopes
that STEM and its related sub-
fields can become an even more
prominent part ofK-12 and higher
educationinthe state.
"(STEM education) hits all
those attributes about innovation,
teamwork, collaboration and real-
ly could lead to great businesses
and long term relationships," he
said.

Inspired by Cameron Esposito's
"Home alone: Lost inyour work"
"The senses, moving toward their
appropriate objects, are producers
of heat and cold, pleasure and pain,
which come and go and are brief and
changeable; these do thou endure, O
traveller. Take heed. Match eyes with
darkness. Because only time will march
by thy side, guiding thee unto an endless
unknown." - Bhagavad Gita: chapter
2, verse14
The last thingyou remember is the
way your index finger clings to the
pages. Fixed eyes dart from left to
right as silent lips trace the outlines
of your mother's language. You're
spread-eagle on your grandparents'
bed. You can smell sticks of incense
sizzling into embers on a side table.
You hear younger cousins gaspingto
climb trees in the summer heat. But
the best part of you knows you're
nowhere near. You're in the air.
You're floating.
Arjuna's chariot smolders. The
horses stampede, their manes
rippling in the feral, blood-choked
stench of carnage. Metal grating,
sparking against the tides of battle.
The hooves' deathly cadence
drumming in your ears.
A water-propelled cooler throws
cold air across your face. The
breeze caresses still limbs as your
grandfather enters the room. He
asks what's in your hands and when
you show him, you can't help but
notice a distinct pride lighten the
time-worn creases on his face. He
asks where you found it. You point
with enthusiasm at his cupboard.
When he sees you answer, he can't
help but notice a distinct fire liven
the curiosity in your eyes.
He teaches you the meaning of
knowledge. He teaches you the
meaning of hard work. He tells you
why it separates the weak from the
strong. He tells you his story.
So you keep reading. You read
about things you never even knew
existed. You read about things
that still don't exist. You see the
power that breathes through good
storytelling. You question why
certain devices leave you writhing
in anticipation while others dust you
with morsels of confusion. Slowly,
veryslowly,youlearnthe importance
of a flawed character. Ypu learn
about conflict. Your eyes search with
more confidence. Somewhere, that
moment where you read your first
curse word is still preserved, where
you can still hear your gasp turning
into a sigh, and then laughter. You
wonder where the stories come
from, about the people who wring
them from life and tame them onto a
page.You wonder if you can see them
in their work. You wonder if you will
ever truly understand what they're
whispering, let alone be one of them.
Time passes. You move away. Your
parents tell you it's for your own
good. You see your grandparents once
every two years. You miss how the
sticks of incense smelled. Nothing
looks the same. People don't look the
same. V-necks. Sweater vests. Leather
boots. Mustard stains. People speak
in strange accents. They make fun of
yours, the way you pronounce your T's
and R's, the way you say "ve" instead
of "we." No one knows your mother's
language. You only hear it at home,
but the best part of you can grasp
some semblance of beauty in the way
it lilts through the walls, shielding
you from this strange new world of
grocery stores and white people. Your

accent changes. You're thankful it
does. There's a pang of regret because
you're thankful. Eventually, suddenly,
you stop hearing your mother's
language altogether. Months pass
by before you notice any signs of its
disappearance. You wonder if this is
what growing up feels like.
You finally meet people who look
like you.You try talking to them in her
tongue, but they stare at you politely,
embarrassed for you, and explain how
they were born here. You understand
why they feel embarrassed for
you. You sense anger coursing in
you. When they notice stereotypes
surrounding them, again they say
"we were born here and have never
even had a chance to visit there." They
reiterate why, on the inside, this makes
them as American asblonde hair, blue
eyes and white skin. So what does
that make me? They celebrate your
culture, but the worst part of you says
they're pretending. You want to tell

them this, but never do.
Time passes. You go back home -
your real home. You hug your grand-
parents longer than they're used to.
You swipe sugary blobs of milk cake
from the pahtry. Your fingers toddle
along brick walls. On the roof, your
aunt unfurls a tartan blanket. She
presses out chili peppers, to be seared
dry under the sun's glaring heat. In
your cousins' stares, you catch snubby
ruptures of hesitation. You try scrib-
bling into speech all the ways you've
changed.You fumble. Knees buckle as
gagging mouthfuls of acrid self-doubt
stalks down the back of yourthroat.
You don't use your American
accent when you talk to them in
English. Air collapses inside your
neck in the moments before you catch
yourself swerving between dialects.
.There's a brief shock accompanying
the realization that you can switch.
You switch. You're ashamed of this.
Your tongue dries. Your lips purse.
You swallow, the way you would if
nervous saliva perched in the fleshy
partsof your cheeks.You switch back.
You pick up your favorite book,
the one your grandfather so gently
put in your hands all those summers
ago.You see dancing, mocking letters.
The writing that once let you scale
faraway realms now escapes you. The
wordsstill dripthroughthe corners of
your mouth but on the page, they're
blurred, alien, distant. You knock. No
one answers. You keep knocking. You
panic. You pound harder. That's what
your grandfather taught you. You feel
an entire world drifting away, and the
worst part ofyou lets it.
The table is set. It always is. The
chairspushed in.Your grandmother is
sitting on the ground, her back against
the doorway, her legs swept out on
the kitchen floor, hands plunged in a
goopy mess of coconut powder, brown
sugar and khoa. You watch in silence
as she moldsathe batter, parceling each
sticky little goop into its own little
envelope of bread. Deft fingers seal
the envelopes before tossing them in
a hissing fryer. They beckon to you,
pass you a cake. Oil still bubbles on its
surface. They brush flour across the
spine of your favorite book.
When she offers to give you
lessons, you say "yes." You sit across
the table from her, shins wobble in
anticipatipnShe watches you say the
letters out loud. EIIIIII. AHHHHH.
EEEEE. She laughs when you fuck it
up. Smiles when you don't. In time,
you learn how to scribble "MY NAME
IS AKSHAY SETH" in massive block
letters. That dinner table/makeshift
classroom is where she speaks with
whatyou are, notcwhat you usedto be.
Where you speak with her.
But then you have to leave. You
have to go back home.
You're at college. One of your
co-workers is really convinced he's
a great guy. The starchy collar on his
button-up shirt bobs up and down,
nodding enthusiastically with his
head, a gleeful leer carved across it.
He wonders out loud if you can still
speak your mother's language. You
don't make eye contact. You press
your forehead on the window. Look
at moisturized shadows condense as
you exhale.
"Yeah isn't it crazy how I still
remember the words Isaid over and
over again for seven years? And then
14 after that."
He tells you he's impressed. But
isn't convinced. He asks you to say a
sentence in her tongue. The collar's
still bobbing. He wants to give you a

high-five and chuckle at the novelty
of hearing something alien. You want
to punch him in the face but you
smile wide and reply "Akshay Seth
thinks you should go fuck yourself,
you condescending little shit" in your
mother's language. You tell him it
means "my name is Akshay Seth and
I am an engineering major."
As time passes, it becomes
harder to switch between the two
languages. Sometimes you catch
yourself speaking with those accents
or pronunciations so often used to
pigeonhole your culture. Because
screwing up just one term, no matter
how little it may be - "golf," "won,"
Thai," "salmon" - means you're
"faking." That you're not really from
-here. It means the smirking fuckface
always there to correct you. It means
having to laugh along awkwardly.
The hot blood exploding on your face
in patches of delicate shame.
Other times, you catch yourself

saying your mother's words without
the inflections that once lived,
breathed between your lips. You
think about that wall you hit when
you're angry or emotional, unable to
articulate anything going through
your mind because it's playingtug-of-
war with two languages. How you're
left sitting there, smothering this
belabored stammering, retraining
it with silence until you glimpse
those brief glimmers - glimmers of
your mother smiling, knowing. The
understanding in her eyes.
You never tell her how much that
understanding means.
So you speak in English. You read
in English. You write in English. You

words. You make your own stories
and sometimes, when you're feeling
brave, you want to place them, gently,
in front of your grandfather's eyes.
You never do. Then it's too late. You
don't understand why the tears never
come when you tease out memories
of that afternoon with him years ago.
When you do cry, it's done in private

this is what growingup feels like.
For brief moments, you find
yourself thinking aboutwhat it would
be like if you went back and never
left. It's a romantic idea. Like the chai
wallahs. The coolies hauling luggage
across sunbathed railwayastations.
Like that time your grandfather
took you to a leatherworker's street
stall. You remember the tiny space,
the beaten walls. The watch straps
and tattered purses and old belts he
liked to collect. While you waded in
the strangeness, he chuckled at the
clunky confusion seeping through
your eyes, down your cheeks, in a
pool thickening on the dust-layered
floors. He examined youintensely and
unblinking. He didn't say anything
wise before going back to sniffingthe
damaged cellphone case in his hand.
You remember your grandfather, as
if in response, motioning, nodding
silently in acknowledgment,
admitting "he does know everything
about leather." You remember how
you believed him.
You know that venturing back into
this world would mean never being
accepted as part of it. You'll always be
seen as that outsider who ask what

will always be the deserter, the family
that never came back. You exist in a
state of halves, and slowly, you come
to the realization that this means no
one will ever truly claim you.
When your uncles ask if you like
your new home better than India, you
always indicate America, but deep
down you're still half unsure, as if
maybe' there's some deeper meaning
in the question - thrust in your
hands so often - still escaping you.
Eventually, finally, you say "I don't
think I'm the same person who left."
You never repeatthose words again.
You decide to stop letting your
background define you. You decide
that if you try hard enough, you'll
get past all the rage, all the blam-
ing so many of your people think is
the answer to inequality. You realize
why peace escapes those who defend
themselves by directing generaliza-
tions in the other direction, those who
infect serious discussion by hiding
behind phrases like "[color] people
are ..." In more ways than not, you're
still one of them. You try hard not to

You see the ways understanding
can caress rigidity into change. Why
hatred stifles it. So you help them
understand. You don't pander. You
don't condescend. You tell them
your 'story. Plaster it in front of
curious, dilated pupils. Dust off its
cracks. Highlight the flaws. Scorch
them with humanity.
And then you place your index
finger on the page. It clings to your
mother's language, whispering silent
flight into still wings.
You soar. You brush along clouds of
a distant sky, feel sheets of moisture
trickle toward mumbling lips. As
your eyes drift low, regret wraps you
in its stiffening embrace, but in that
pain you feel the gusts, the winds of
strength carrying you forth.
You accept that this is what

Engaging in the world

After the 2012 presidential election,
Politico published an article citing
Tufts University studythat found Mitt
Romney may have gotten
away with his plans to call
the White House "home"
were it not for those
meddling kids.
Nationally, 67 percent of
young voters cast ballots in
favor of President Barack
Obama in 2012, while Rom-
ney secured only 30 percent. TYLER
According to the report, SCOTT
Obama won at least 61 per-
cent of the youth vote in
the so-called "swing states" of Florida, Vir-
ginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Thanks to the
intricacies of the Electoral College, had Rom-
ney been able to earn a split decision among
young voters he would have nabbed those
states - and the presidency - from Obama.
The next presidential election is still two
years away, but the truth about the young-
est voting bloc's newfound significance is an
important lesson to learn. At a young age, the
millennial generation has cemented itself as
an active and concerned demographic, whose
numbers in 2012 continued the trend of increas-
ing young voter participation since 2004.
The importance of our own political
consciousness doesn't lie where we choose to
pin ourselves - individually or collectively -
on the political map. We're at the dawn of the
defining day of our generational adulthood,
where the actions taken by and on the behalf
of millennials could result in changes to laws,
policy and culture in the short term, with
limitless future potential.
This generation is far from the first group
of people to call for equal rights and social
justice. For decades, members and advocates of
the LGBTQ community have been fighting for
their own civil liberties, the same can be said
for feminists, and not long ago the legalization
of marijuana was a far-fetched pipe dream of
those furthest left. This is the work of previous
generations, ideals that are - now gaining
unprecedented progress. Progress that is, at
least partially, due to sweeping support from
us - the youths.
As a demographic, millennials are wholly
buying into the notion of our own ability to
influence society. With the issues mentioned

above, we have already made an impact. Yet
other problems persist, like the uncomfortable
reality of being institutionally pigeonholed into
gambling our futures on the present by taking
on massive debt for an education in hopes to
achieve relevance, security and livelihood in a
changing economy. We are still young enough
to have not had the time to earn the revenue,
nor forge the relationships, to control our own
future. Yet, our needs are real.
Ultimately, if millennials continue to hold
stock in the idea that we all have political
significance regardless of resources it may
become truer. Because with pockets thin or
thick, one vote is still avote, and for any aspiring
politician, a collective body of youngsters that
consistently show up at the polls could present
the possibility of a heck of a lot of votes for
discount rates.
Of course, it all hinges on whether young
America continues to reach higher levels
of social and political fusion not just on the
biggest stages of presidential elections, but all
of them.
Every election in every town is a chance for
more millennials to cast ballots and to become
a bigger percentage of America's voting public,
as we did in 2012. That will only lead to more
time being spent figuring out what causes us
to vote. For example, if more students head to
the polls, maybe Ann Arbor will end up electing
a mayor with a more favorable view towards
student life.
Not to say it will not result in an overnight
redirection of political sympathies in the Unit-
ed States - it won't. Butthe time to define what
a generation means to society is a very narrow
windowthat just happens to be open now.
It's not that millennials own some special
ability. It is important to be sure the chance to
make a difference isn't squandered.
Referring his own generation, author
Stephen King wrote, "We had a chance to
change the world, and opted for the home
shopping network instead."
Millennials have that same chance. Take note
from those that did grasp at the opportunity for
change and left a lasting impact on the world.
Regardless of the cause, if enough energy is
put forward, there will be an effect. Become
engaged and change the world.

MOVIE RTV/NEW MEDIA MN
Summer's 'Extant' effect

MAGNOLIA
We all wear masks, metaphorically speaking.
Frank' challe ges
Social Media Age

If you're anything like me,
there's a slew of TV series that
premiere in the warmer months,
after school ends and responsibili-
ties fall by the wayside, that you
wait around
all year for.
"True Blood,"
perhaps?
"Orange Is
the New.
Black?"
Maybe it was
"Weeds" or
"The Closer?"
Or maybe it ALEC
will be "The STERN
Leftovers" or
"The Strain?"
To some,
summertime equals vacations,
beaches, sunshine. But to us, it's
all about television.
It wasn't always like that.Years
ago, the months between Mayand
September were a TV wasteland,
back during a time when the
broadcast networks - the likes of
CBS, NBC,ABC and FOX - were
all that existed and people would
actually go outside and enjoy
what the season hadnto offer.
Since the advent of cable - and
with it, quality summer offerings
from dozens of providers - the
old fashioned broadcast nets have
been forced to play catch-up. But
as I watched the latest episode
of "Extant," perhapsthe biggest
investment a broadcast network
has ever made in the lower-rated
season, I couldn't help but think...
this is the best they can do?
"Extant" is CBS's expensive
13-episode sci-fi epic, executive
produced by Steven Spielberg and
starring Halle Berry in her first
regular television role since 1989.
That sentence alone is enough to
make any TV executive drool, so,
notsurprisingly, the dramawas
ordered straight-to-series, bypass-
ing the pilot stage and ensuring a
comfortable launch date accom-
panied by a significant market-
ing campaign. However, when
"Extant" finally hitthe screens
on July 9, its critical and commer-
cial receptioiwas more or less a'
resounding shrug. By episode four,
the series' timeslot had already
been shifted and its ratings were
losing outto "Sharknado 2: The
Second One."

The film is about radical

the band encounters, main-

material girls in a material
world. But one thing this movie
does is show that being "indie"
or "alternative" is OK and
sometimes better. In our soci-
ety, we're told that we should
want Fame and Fortune: we
define success on these terms.
But this movie suggests that
Fame and Fortune sometimes,
maybe most of the time, don't
mean success. Sometimes they
mean failure. The movie seems
to be arguing that success (and
by extension happiness) ought
to be defined more individually
and that we should be wary of
the answers that our culture
pushes on us.
What's radical and rebel-
lious about the Soronprfbs
is that they don't care about
what anyone else thinks. They
make music and do their thing,
not strictly or necessarily for
themselves. They do it for the
sake of doing it, not for per-
forming for others. The film's
central conflict is the charac-
ters' (Jon excluded) disinterest
in the approval of others versus
civilization's push to make the
individual subordinate to the
opinion of the masses.
In the final scene, watching
the Soronprfbs improvise in
a lonely, godforsaken bar, Jon
realizes that the band is in its
right place. Without sacrific-
ing their individuality or com-
promising their genius, they've
found where they fit in. Jon
sees that the Soronprfbs don't
belong on YouTube or Twitter,
they belong in the grungy bar
with a handful of "regulars"
half asleep and barely paying
attention. The band doesn't fit
the paradigm of success that
Jon's mainstream ideology pre-
scribed, but they fit their own
paradigm, and that's what's
important.

Notre Shame: Good, bad and ugl

It wasn't all bad.
But there were far
more negatives
than positives
By GREG GARNO
ManagingSports Editor
We could have titled this "The
not as bad, the bad and the ugly,"
after the Michigan football team
was shut out by Notre Dame
on Saturday, 31-0. We didn't,
but there was plenty that went
wrong in the Wolverines' first
shutout since 1984.
The Daily football beat picks
out the good, the bad and the
ugly from this week.
The Good
The weather was nice.

A comfortable 70 degrees
Fahrenheit on Saturday night
with a perfect sunset and not
a cloud in the sky. It looked
good on TV and was great for
tailgating.
Aside from that, there wasn't
much to be positive about.
The Wolverines' run
defense shined as it limited the
Fighting Irish to 54 yards and
one touchdown on 31 carries.
That number includes minus-
14 rushing from quarterback
Everett Golson, though.
And most of those carries
came in the fourth quarter,
when Notre Dame had the game
safely in hand.
Junior wide receiver Devin
Funchess was the lone bright
spot for the offense, finishing
with 107 yards on 11 receptions,
but he wasn't always given the
chance to jump up for the ball.

The Bad
Michigan's rush offense still
posted a 100-yard game, but it
failed to geta single runner over
30 yards and, most importantly,
failed to score a touchdown.
The combination of
sophomore running backs
Derrick Green and De'Veon
Smith wasn't bruising enough
to barrel over defenders, and
the offensive line didn't open up
holes.
And the offensive line didn't
do much to protect fifth-year
senior quarterback Devin
Gardner, who was sacked just
twice but forced to run away
even more. He fumbled the ball
after the protection broke down
and didn't have the time to sit in
the pocket to pass to Funchess.
The Ugly

Senior kicker Matt Wile had
a forgettable game in a season
that isn't looking optimistic.
Wile finished 0-for-2 on field
goal attempts, making him
1-for-4 on the season.
He couldn't manage to get the
ball close to the goalpost on his
second attempt, slipping on his
plant foot.
Michigan coach Brady
Hoke said Wile's job wasn't in
jeopardy, but backup kicker
Kenny Allen was warming up on
the sideline at times.
Gardner didn't do much to
help Wile out, though. Gardner
and the rest of the offense failed
to make it to the red zone and
put him within a safe range.
Gardner finished 19-of-
32 with 189 yards and four
turnovers on the night. He
started the game 6-for-6, but
struggled for the remainder of

The quiet arrogance of a Michigan Man

icture this: It's Jan. 12,
2011, and you've just
been named Michigan's
new head football coach. You're
-standing
behind a
podium
at your
introductory
press
'conference,
and it's
time to field ALEJANDRO
'questions. Z NIGA
The
guy you're
replacing wasn't a Michigan
Man, but you are. You were
raised in the heart of the
Wolverines' biggest rivalry.
You were an assistant here. You
dropped everything and "would
have walked" to Ann Arbor if
that's what it took to accept
your dream job.
Because you're a Michigan
Man.
You're bold and arrogant,
and you can be, because you'll
win. You'll guard the new Fort
Schembechler, and few will
complain, because when you
win, there aren't too many
doubters.
So when a reporter asks
you about the state of the
program, which has become
a national punchline under
your predecessor, you reply
with a brash statement about
being elite and continuing to be
elite, because this is Michigan,
fergodssake, and now that
there's a Michigan Man in
charge, things will be right
again.
Brady, it's time to stop the
charade. It's not 2011 anymore.
The fanbase is turning on you,
people are calling for your head,
and it's your fault..
In case you were already
preparingthe post-game
speech to your team, here's

Brady, picture this: It's Sept.
6, 2014, and it's your fourth year
as Michigan's football coach.
Your team just entered the
history books by failingto score
a single point, snapping an all-
time NCAA record.
You're the last one to leave
the locker room, and you walk
out alone to the four officers
who are waiting to escort you
to the team bus. As you slip
by Gate A onto Notre Dame's
campus, a group of Michigan
fans spot you.
You turn away, perhaps
expecting vitriol, but instead,
the voices are positive.
"Good luck the rest of the
season, coach!" yells one, and
another shouts, "Beat Ohio
State - that's all I care about!"
So you slow down but don't
stop, and .you raise your hand
in acknowledgement of the
support that has become
increasingly rare since the 2011
Sugar Bowl.
Then you spot your wife, so
you give hera hug, then a kiss,
then a longer embrace. She's
been there for tough days since
your first head coaching job in
2003, so maybe she knows it's
best to stay quiet, and you don't
say anything, either.
But Brady, losses like
this aren't new to Michigan
anymore. And as convenient as
it may seem, silence is not the
answer.

NIGHTMARE
From Page lB
cornerbacks Raymon Taylor
and Jabrill Peppers injured,
Michigan's secondary looked
helpless.
By halftime, the Fighting
Irish led 21-0. Quarterback
Everett Golson completed 16 of
his 21 passes - Michigan's pass
rush nonexistent. He was the
.one who had the happy ending
on this night.
For Michigan coach Brady
Hoke, the ending came slowly.
:He stood on the sideline
through it all, alternating
between crossing his arms
and putting his hands on his
hips. When his team needed
encouragement, he lent them
a few claps. There was no
shortage of necessity.
Leading up to the game,
Hoke repeatedly said he had
a plan when it came to his
offensive line. It seemed he had
more plans than the coolest kid
on campus. But then Saturday,
the coolest kid on campus had
what had to have been one of
the worst nights of his coaching
life. It was brutal, it was
unrelenting.
Think of one of those
nights you've had in college,
the ones where the bad news
doesn't seem to end. When
your girlfriend dumps you at

dinner and then your fraternity
party is broken up by the cops.
Then when you go to Skeeps to
salvage the night, your fake ID
is taken.
Hoke must've felt even
worse than that after the game,
when he swore his team would
bounce back. He said he has
seen what they're capable of in
practice.
But nobody else has seen it.
His players showed little
at the end of this rivalry, a
game they all said they wanted
to win badly. We saw sacks,
hurries and pressures on
offense. We saw Notre Dame
defensive lineman Jarron Jones
throttling Michigan center
Jack Miller backwards, forcing
a Gardner fumble.
We saw a defense that looked
out of its league in the passing
game. We saw cornerback Blake
Countess get beat on a move
off the line of scrimmage by
receiver Will Fuller with 34
seconds left in the first half.
When Countess finally caught
up in the end zone, we saw
Fuller catch the touchdown
over his shoulder.
We saw wretched special
teams, too. We watched
Michigan kicker Matt Wile
miss two field goals that
seemed consequential at the
time. In the end, they weren't.
We saw the end of the
Wolverines' streak of not being

shut out. It was 365 games, now
it's back to zero. Sometimes
endings rip up the record
books.
Endings can be as cruel to
the body as they are to the
mind. Michigan's players exited
the stadium with chicken
sandwiches, the pheasant Hoke
compared Notre Dame to when
the Fighting Irish decided they
didn't want to play his team
anymore. Chickens in hand, the
Wolverines were badly bruised.
Taylor had a boot on his leg.
So too did star wide receiver
Devin Funchess. Defensive
end Frank Clark's right hand
was wrapped up. If you were
looking for smiles, the exit to
Notre Dame Stadium wasn't the
place.
On Michigan's last offensive
play from scrimmage, Gardner
threw an interception. All hope
was lost, but Gardner didn't
care. He chased after Elijah
Shumate while he sprinted
toward the end zone.
But then Gardner was
flattened in his pursuit, staying
on the ground while the clock
ticked toward zero. He won't
get another shot at Notre Dame
and neither will Michigan.
Instead, all they get is this
nightmare.

Gardner reverts to old self

Quarterback's

SOUTH BEND, Ind. - Devin
Gardner went for it when it was
too late.
He didn't need to'drop back
and scan the field, not with seven
seconds left. He didn't need to
make the pass, not then.
He was past achance to salvage
the game; two interceptions
and one fumble too late to do
anything. And he didn't learn the
lessons his coach and teammates
said he did.
He didn't see it all come down
until he looked into the black
pellets of a new turf field.
The fifth-year senior, with
his helmet buried in the hard,
rough turf, lay alone on the
43-yard line, with only himself
to reside in and only himself to
get off the field.
The Notre Dame football
team raced to the end zone and
Michigan chased after, watching

Even with a
new offensive coordinator set to
save his offense, Gardner ran out
of the pocket after he held onto
the ball too long, absorbing each
hit from the Fighting Irish. His
fumble on the second down was
the result of scrambling into the
heart of defenders.
"We held the ball a little too
long," Gardner said. "A lot of
things happened we wish we
could have done better."
The chance to make a play
wasn't during the final seven

seconds. It was on a third-and-

Or when the drive starts at the

By the time he got up there
was a crowd there and no one
clapping for reassurance. His
team was headed off the field
without him, each hanging head
more despondent than the next
filingout.
"He's a quarterback," said
Michigan coach Brady Hoke.
"We're going to play some other
really big games on the road
this year, and for him to keep
improving, he needs to play
quarterback."
But he'll have to do it with his
head out of the turf.

breaking in
its new home stadium.
The 17th-ranked Wolverines
were flat-out dominant in
their return to Ann Arbor this
weekend, posting back-to-
back shutouts on their way to
completing a home sweep.
Michigan followed its victory
over William & Mary in the
home opener with Sunday's 6-0
drubbing of Central Michigan.
The Wolverines' offense was
firing on all cylinders against
the overmatched Chippewas,
outshooting them 16-2 and
outcornering them, 5-2.
"It was a good weekend,"
said Michigan coach Marcia
Pankratz. "We were on the road
a long time. They love playing
at home. This is a phenomenal
facility and a phenomenal
homecourt advantage."
Michigan (2-2) stormed out of
the gates Sunday with three goals
in the opening six minutes of the
match, the first coming at the
2:14 mark when junior forward
Shannon Scavelli redirected a
shot from freshmen forward
Courtney Enge. While Central
Michigan's goalkeeper Sadie

initial attempt, a diving Scavelli

Youth, inexperience
doom Wolverines

By RAJAT KHARE
Daily Sports Editor
Down 17-21 in the third set,
it was the Michigan volleyball
team's last chance for a late push
to keep its chance intact to sweep
in the Big Ten/ACC Challenge.
And it obliged.
After a long exchange between
the 20th-ranked Tar Heels and
Wolverines, the rally ended with
an emphatic block by freshman
outside hitter Adeja Lambert,
bringing the dormant crowd at
Cliff Keen Arena back to life.
"I loved the way Adeja came in
and was aggressive," said coach
Mark Rosen. "Late in the match,
we decided to make that change
and she was ready. She came in
right off the bat and had a great
block, two great kills and that
was a great sign for her. She really
created some great momentum."
The Wolverines (3-2) rode the
momentum, tallying four straight
points, tying up the game at 21
and forcing a North Carolina
timeout.
After the break, the Tar Heels
(4-1) scored two points before
Michigan answered back with
three of its own, taking a 25-24
lead and earning the opportunity
to push the match to a fourth set.
The comeback was not to be
though. A net violation against
the Wolverines tied the score
before the Tar Heels scored the
final two points on a kill and a
hitting error.
"I loved the fact that our team
has come back and after the first
set, has been better," Rosen said.
"They've continually gotten bet-
ter as the match has gone on."
The Wolverines got off to a
-ockluster start, falling behind
7-2 and forcing themselves into
an uphill battle for much of the
first set.
"I didn't think we were com-
municating as well in the begin-
ning as well as we did yesterday
(against Duke)," said junior out-
side hitter Ally Davis. "It could
have been better by just talking

to each other and keeping up the
energy."
The Tar Heels pressed their
advantage, never allowing Michi-
gan to eliminate their lead and
won the first set, 25-16.
Michigan bounced back in the
second set, exchanging the lead
five times with North Carolina.
The Wolverines got off to a
quick start and took a 6-2 lead
early on. North Carolina battled
back, though, tying the game at
eight before Michigan began to
pull away, tallying four straight
points at 14-12, the last on a
Davis kill.
North Carolina staged a run
of their own, though, trimming
Michigan's lead to two at 19-17,
forcing a Michigan timeout. The
Tar Heels won the next point,
cutting the lead to one, before
freshman right side hitter Kath-
erine Mahlke brought the lead
back up to two with a kill. Along
with Davis, she led Michigan
with nine for the match.
The Tar Heels and Wolverines
went back and forth until, tied
at 24, Michigan committed two
hitting errors, giving the set to
North Carolina, 26-24.
"When the game gets close, a

lot of the hitters just go up and
try and bang the ball," Davis said.
"And it's a good thing to learn
from because, in the heat of the
moment, we need to know that,
that's not always going to be the
best decision and we were trying
to crush the ball to end the game
and that's something that we
need to work on."
Just five games into the season
and playing without their lone
senior setter Lexi Dannemiller
and a recuperating junior outside
hitter in Kelly Murphy, the ACC/
Big Ten Challenge allowed this
young Michigan team to gain
experience against a seasoned
North Carolina squad. Early on,
the Wolverines decision-making
highlighted their inexperience
but the team continued
to compete and created
opportunities in both the second
and third set to extend the match.
As the season continues
to mature and the team gets
healthy, this young team could
surprise come Big Ten play.
Though this weekend provided a
good measure of where the team
currently stands, ultimately it's
the last game of the season that
truly matters, as Rosen put it.

Michigan coach Greg Ryan has allowed freshman Megan Hinz to compete for a startingjob over Taylor Bucklin.
Hinz earns twoshutouts

By BRAD WHIPPLE
Daily Sports Writer
Last year, Taylor Bucklin
made a name for herself as
the most successful rookie
goalkeeper in Michigan women's
soccer history.
But that doesn't guarantee her
a starting spot this year.
"If you perform well, you
get to play," said Michigan
coach Greg Ryan. "If you're
off, somebody else is playing.
Nobody has a spot."
On a roster with five talented
goalkeepers, the competition is
fiercer than before. Ryan - who
has stressed the irrelevance
of past seasons - is keeping
things simple.
And Bucklin learned that the
hard way, when she gave up five
goals during the Wolverines' trip
to California last weekend. The
poor performance landed her a
spot on the bench this weekend.
Bucklin's replacement, Megan
Hinz, is a freshman now taking
the reigns of a defense still in its
developing stages. Hinz played
all 180 minutes this weekend and
posted consecutive shutouts to
help her team rebound from two
blowout losses.
"They're competing, and that's,
the way it's goingto be this year,"
Ryan said. "They're competing
every time they step on this field.
... (Hinz) had a good weekend, she

getsthenextstart. If she cankeep
putting these games together,
she'll keep playing. Taylor'sgot to
wait (for) her chance."
Friday against Toledo (3-2-
1), Hinz made just two saves
in Michigan's 4-0 victory. Her
performance didn't waver in
the slightest Sunday, when her
two saves were good enough
for a 3-0 shutout over Central
Michigan (1-3-1).
The pair of shutouts comes
after the Wolverines gave up
eight goals through two games
last weekend, two of which were
allowed by Hinz. Nonetheless,
she got the starting nod over
Bucklin. -
Now, with three starts this
season, Hinz will be in the net for
the Wolverines' (4-2) opening Big
Ten homestand, assuming the
trend continues. Up to this point,
though, Hinz hasn't felt much
intimidation.
"Being able to play behind such
a great team helps, and I didn't
really have to do all that much
this weekend," Hinz said. "Com-
inginto itwith such astrongteam
really helps my confidence."
Within the final minutes of
Sunday's game against Central
Michigan, though, the back line
broke down and Hinz was tested.
In the 81st minute, Chippewa
midfielder Emily Cooksey snuck
past Michigan's right back, and
crashed the net. Instead of wait-

ing for a shot, Hinz charged
from the net and struck the ball
away from Cooksey inside the
penalty box.
Had Hinz mishandled the
shot, it would've resulted in a
goal. But she looked confident
enough to ensure that wouldn't
happen, which is why she made
the same play a minute later.
"Dealing with balls coming in
behind, it's always nice to have
an aggressive person that's going
to come up and get the ball that
the defense can't," Hinz said. "I
try to provide that, so that way
they're notalways sprintingback
while I hold my line, because if
they geta shot off that close, you
never know."
According to Ryan, Hinz's
aggressiveness is her biggest
strength and the main reason she
was recruited.
"Being that aggressive can be
good or bad," Ryan said. "If you
use it at the right time, it's great.
If you're overaggressive, you can
beat yourself ... If (Hinz) can use
that aggression effectively and
not give away anything, she's
going to do really well."
In the five games Hinz has
played this season, she has given
up just two goals, better than
Bucklin's three during the first
six games of 2013.
But that doesn't mean much,
because, as Bucklin learned, good
things can come to a quick end.

Five things we learned: 'M' vs. Notre Dame

The Irish exposed
plenty of holes in
igan's game
Saturday
ByALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Editor
SOUTH BEND, Ind. - After a
dominant showing in week one
against Appalachian State, the
Michigan football team stalled
on the road yet again. The stage
was set in South Bend, a rivalry
game between two historic
programs for the last time, under
the lights. But the Wolverines
severely under performed and
were shut out, 31-0, for the first
time since 1984.
After an ugly performance,
it was evident that some of last
year's fundamental problems
have yet to be fixed.
1. Brady Hoke needs to go
back to the drawing board:
This isn't a huge mystery
following Michigan's disaster on
Saturday night, but it still rings
true. The Wolverines struggled
in all three phases of the game,
on their way to their first shutout
in 30 years. The offense was
unable to convert in the red zone,
the few times it got there, and the
running game transitioned back
to its 2013 woes.
Fifth-year senior quarterback
Devin Gardner turned the ball
over three times - a fourth
being called back - and spent
an extended amount of time
running for his life behind a
porous offensive line.
The defense gave up big plays
throughout the night, didn't
force a turnover and only sacked
Notre Dame quarterback Everett
Golson once. After the game,
senior middle linebacker Jake
Ryan said it's critical the defense
gets off the field on third down.
And to round out the
performance, senior kicker Matt

pressure on his right leg, but
the junior wide out shook it off
and made an appearance on the
field during the Wolverines' last
drive. However, after one play he
took himself out and following
the game Hoke "wasn't going to
talk about any of those injuries."
Funchess was seen wearing a
boot as he exited the stadium.
Early last week, Gardner
said Funchess could be the best
receiver to ever playat Michigan.
And while his words maynotring
true considering the program's
storied crop of receivers, the
praise is warranted - two weeks
in, Funchess is the best player on
this team.
5. The Wolverines will
have a chip on their shoulder
against Miami (OH):
Unfortunately for the Red
Hawks, Michigan should come
out motivated this coming
Saturday. After 30 years, and
365 games, the Wolverines were
shut out. Plus, to make matters
worse it was the last matchup
in a rivalry series. In short, it's
going to be a long day for Miami
(OH) because Michigan has a lot
to show its fans.

Ai

The Michigan football team has the good
Wile missed two field goals
bringing him to 1-for-4 over two
games. The coverage unit also
struggled at times and missed
tackles, which led to good field
position for the Fighting Irish.
2. The offensive line is still
struggling:
Following a strong
performance against the
Mountaineers in week one,
where the running backs rushed
for more than 350 yards, spirits
were high on Michigan's biggest
area of need this season. But
after Saturday night's debacle,
the jury needs to reevaluate its
early season excitement.
Though the line only gave
up two sacks, Gardner was
flushed from the pocket multiple
times. The running game
wasn't efficient. Four backs

4. Devin Funchess is the
best player on this football
team:
There was one bright spot in
Michigan's 31-0 whopping and it
came in the form of a dominant
6-foot-5 receiver.
Amid all that was ugly
Saturday night, Funchess came
away with nine receptions for
107 yards. And the Wolverines
can be thankful, that their best
player was able to bounce back
after an apparent leg injury.
Toward the end of the fourth
quarter, Funchess went down in
front of Michigan's bench after a
sideline catch.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY TOP-10 POLL

Ij
S

1. OREGON: The Ducks would
normally get props for racking
up 46 points. But they did it
aginst a team from the Big
Ten. Does that even count?
2. FLORIDA STATE: Jameis
Winston threw for 256 yards
and two touchdowns to crush
the Citadel. He didn't steal
anything in the process.
3. ALABAMA: The Tide
used two quarterbacks in
their 41-0 win over Florida
Atlantic. Can the Daily
borrow one when we play the
State News?
4. GEORGIA: The Bulldogs
had the week off before
playing South Carolina.
Facing opponents on fresh
legs could come back to bite
the Cocks.

ATM

S. OKLAHOMA: It's hard to
gauge OU when they're playing
teams like Tulsa. The Sooner
they play a real team, the
better.
6. TEXAS A&M: The Aggies'
quarterback calls himself
Kenny Trill. Until he flips off
the, err, Washington Football
Team, we'll call him Kenny
Poser.
7. AUBURN Tigers kicker
Daniel Carlson outscored the
entire Michigan team this
weekend. He had one 27-yard
field goal.
8. BAYLOR: Despite their main
act having a back injury, Bryce
Petty's Heartbreakers beat
Northwestern State 70-6.

Each week, Daily sports staffers fill out
ballots, with first place votes receiving 10
points, second-place votes receiving nine,
and so on.
9. LSU: Leonard Fournette struck
a Heisman pose on his first career
touchdown run. Against Sam
Houston State. Stay classy, Baton
Rouge.
10. USC: Some would call
the Trojans' 13-10 win
over Stanford a big win
for the program. We call it
deforestation.
