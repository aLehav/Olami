ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

University President Mark Schlissel addresses students during his monthly fireside chat with students in the Michigan Union on Thursday.

During fireside 

chat, president also

For 
University 
President 

Mark Schlissel’s final fireside 
chat of the semester, several 

students had the opportunity 
Thursday afternoon to engage 
with the president on a wide 
variety of campus issues, from 
student debt to the University’s 
sexual 
assault 
investigation 

policy.

E. 
Royster 
Harper, 
vice 

president for student life, was 
also present for the event, 
which was held in the Pond 
Room of the Michigan Union. 
Harper took notes throughout 
the meeting, which serves as a 

monthly platform for students 
to raise topics of concern to the 
president.

Campus diversity

When asked about his next 

steps following the Diversity 
Summit held last month to 
improve diversity, equity and 
inclusion on campus, Schlis-
sel said the University is very 
far from its end goal: building 
a campus community that is 
reflective of the society which 

it intends to serve.

“We’ve made some progress 

this year, but it’s going to be 
forever,” he said. “We’re going 
to be working on this as long as 
I’m president. It’s not going to 
be over in three years or some-
thing, so we have a long way to 
go.”

However, Schlissel did out-

line specific programs that 
have already been initiated in 
the past year to improve the 

Legislation could 
expand scholarship 
program to five more 

school districts

The Michigan House Work-

force and Talent Development 
Committee 
heard 
testimony 

Thursday on legislation related 
to the state’s promise zones as 
they prepare to formulate a rec-
ommendation for the full House, 
where representatives could vote 
on two bills in the near future.

The testimony concerned Sen-

ate Bill 0539 and Senate Bill 0540, 
which seek to expand a statewide 
program launched in 2008. That 
program aims to cover some or 
all of the costs of in-state tuition 
at public schools after financial 
aid awards with a combination of 
state and private funds. The bills 
propose five additional school 
districts be labeled as promise 
zones, making a total of 15.

Anna Mooney, deputy chief of 

staff for Sen. Goeff Hansen (R–
Hart), and Brianna McGarry, a 
legislative assistant for Sen. Jim 
Ananich (D–Flint), delivered the 

testimony Thursday on behalf of 
the two senators, who each spon-
sored one of the bills.

The Michigan State Trea-

sury supervises the establish-
ment of the promise zones, 
which currently serve students 
in 10 high-poverty school dis-
tricts. Students’ eligibility for 
these scholarships, as well as the 
amount they are each eligible 
to receive, often depend on how 
long they have attended school 
in the district, and could also be 
contingent on factors such as col-
lege GPA.

In an e-mail interview, Cyn-

thia Wilbanks, vice president for 
government affairs, noted the 
growing interest of school dis-
tricts across Michigan in estab-
lishing promise zones.

“The expansion of the prom-

ise zones has been stimulated by 
the interest of several more com-
munities in the state that want to 
support the post-secondary edu-
cation aspirations among their 
residents,” she said.

During her testimony, McGar-

ry said the creation of more 
promise zones is important to 
increasing access to higher edu-
cation in Michigan. She noted 
that there have been districts, 
such as Flint, that want to estab-

One of the longstanding tra-

ditions of Ann Arbor’s music 
scene 
is 
the 

annual 
per-

formance 
of 

George 
Frid-

eric 
Handel’s 

renowned 
oratorio, 
“Messiah,” 
by 
the 
Uni-

versity 
Cho-

ral Union, a choir comprised of 
Ann Arborites and University 
students. Every year, Ann Arbor 
residents comes to Hill Audito-
rium to witness Handel’s beau-
tiful musical rendition of Jesus 
Christ’s birth, life, death, resur-
rection and ascension to Heaven. 
This year, the job of directing 
the annual production was given 
to Scott Hanoian, a conductor, 
church organist and University 
alum who now serves as the Uni-
versity Choral Union’s conductor, 

directed the annual production.

“It’s a piece that I love really 

deeply, and a work that I think 
really speaks to the Ann Arbor 
community every year,” Hanoian 
said. “What I think has made 
‘Messiah’ stand the test of time 
and why people keep coming 
back to it … is that the piece is 
really a perfect marriage of text-
slash-story and music, and the 
way Handel brought the text … 
to life through music in ways that 
reading the text doesn’t bring in 
the same way.”

Hanoian grew up as an organ-

ist and attended the University of 
Michigan where he majored in 
organ performance. During his 
undergraduate years, he devel-
oped an interest in conducting 
choirs and studied under Jerry 
Blackstone, whom he succeeded 
as University Choral Union con-
ductor this year. Hanoian was 
eventually accepted into the 
graduate conducting program at 
the University, earning masters 
degrees in choral conducting and 
church music simultaneously.

“I really developed a passion 

for some of the great choral mas-
terworks,” Hanoian said of his 
experience in graduate school. 
Among these works was Handel’s 
“Messiah.”

Save the Deer 
group targeting 
Ward 2’s Kirk 

Westphal

By ISOBEL FUTTER

Daily Staff Reporter

Councilmember Kirk West-

phal (D–Ward 2) is facing a 
recall effort from the local 
group Save the Deer Ann Arbor 
over his vote in support of the 
city’s forthcoming deer cull.

A 8-1 majority of council 

members voted in favor of a 
four-year deer management 
plan in August and subse-
quently voted 10-1 in Novem-
ber to hire sharpshooters to 
kill 100 area deer this winter in 
an effort to control their popu-
lation. Westphal voted along-
side the majority both times.

Sabra Sanzotta, spokesper-

son for Save the Deer, filed the 
recall paperwork Monday, cit-
ing concerns with the scien-
tific basis underlying the cull 
and potentially negative rami-
fications. Her group has previ-

ously asked the city to gather 
more data before taking action.

“There is an unjust, uniden-

tifiable risk to public safety,” 
Sanzotta said. “And the cull 
that Kirk Westphal voted in 
favor of doesn’t have the ben-
efit of scientific evidence to 
prove that it’s even effective.”

Sanzotta said she chose to 

file a petition against Westphal 
specifically because she is a 
Ward 2 resident.

The brain is one of the most 

complex organs in the human 
body and has been studied exten-
sively for years — on Earth at 
least.

Now, a University professor is 

trying to uncover unique effects 
the organ experiences as it adapts 
to microgravity, or the feeling of 
weightlessness, in space.

Kinesiology 
Prof. 
Rachael 

Seidler, through a partnership 
with NASA, is exploring how 
long periods of time in space 
affect the brain and its functions, 
as well as investigating potential 
countermeasures for the neuro-
logical effects of microgravity.

It currently takes several 

weeks to recover from space-
flight, and her research on how 
the brain reacts to time in space 
could help speed up that process.

Seidler said the project has 

connections to research about 
brain adaption on Earth as well.

“I’ve always been interested in 

monitoring adaptation and how 
people learn new motor skills,” 
she said. “Adapting to the micro-

City Council to vote on new 
committee members, calendar

200 ‘U’ courses to leverage 
tech, cater to non-students

The council will also 
discuss a new state 
bill to amend speed 

limit provisions

By ISOBEL FUTTER

Daily Staff Reporter

Monday’s Ann Arbor City 

Council meeting will largely 
focus on preparing for the 2016 
calendar year, including shifting 
committee assignments and set-
ting an agenda.

Council committees

Following November’s city 

elections and the subsequent 
addition of new council mem-
bers, 2016 committee assign-
ments have been rearranged and 
will be up for approval. There 
are 36 committees in total.

In 2016, recently elected 

Councilmember Zachary Acker-
man (D–Ward 3), an LSA senior, 
will join six committees, pend-

ing Council approval. These 
include the Ann Arbor Summer 
Festival Liaison, the Audit Com-
mittee, the Board of Insurance 
Administration, 
Housing 
& 

Human Services and the Advi-
sory Board and Park Advisory 
Commission.

Councilmember Chip Smith 

(D–Ward 5) will likely join 
five committees, including the 
Brownfield Committee, Bud-
get and Labor Committee, the 
Energy Commission, the Envi-
ronmental Commission and the 
Liquor Control Commission.

City Council will also vote on 

a resolution to appoint Council-
member Julie Grand (D–Ward 
3) to the Greenbelt Advisory 
Commission. This is an advisory 
committee on decisions involv-
ing largely undeveloped, wild or 
agricultural land in the area.

Council rules and calendar
The Council will also vote 

on a resolution to approve the 
proposed 2016 Ann Arbor City 
Council Rules — a set of stan-

dard operating procedures for 
Council-related business.

One proposed rule outlines 

the councilmembers’ adminis-
trative responsibilities, stipulat-
ing that council members may 
not provide direction directly 
to city staff, but should do so 
through the city administrator.

The 2016 Council calendar 

will also be approved, which 
schedules each of the public 
Council meetings and work ses-
sions.

If approved, meetings will 

still occur bi-monthly at 7 p.m. 
on Monday evenings. The calen-
dar also outlines 12 work session 
dates that are open to the public. 
Three work session dates — two 
in February and one in March 
— are dedicated to budget pur-
poses and will only be held if 
necessary.

Michigan Vehicle Code

The Council will vote on a 

resolution to oppose Michigan 
House Bill 4425, which amends 
the Michigan Vehicle Code 
Memorandum. This package of 
bills, introduced in the Michi-
gan House of Representatives 
in September, would amend the 
Michigan Vehicle Code provi-
sions on speed limits.

Under the proposed amend-

ment, a speed limit would have 
to be at the 85th percentile of 
speed of free-flowing traffic. 
The speed of free-flowing traffic 
would be measured under ideal 
conditions and rounded to the 
nearest multiple of five.

Councilmembers 
Sabra 

Briere (D–Ward 1), Graydon 
Krapohl (D–Ward 4) and Ann 
Arbor Mayor Christopher Tay-
lor (D), as well as Smith and 
Ackerman, are cosponsoring the 
resolution, which states that the 
ability to modify speed limits to 
address road conditions is a tool 
of the local government, not the 
state. The resolution opposes 
interference from Lansing with 
local streets and neighborhoods, 
as the state would not be able to 
account for local conditions.

Office of Digital 

Education to retrofit 
courses leading up to 

bicentenial

By DESIREE CHEW

For the Daily

Aligned with the University’s 

upcoming bicentennial celebra-
tions, the Office of Digital Educa-
tion & Innovation announced its 
intention to adapt 200 University 
courses to cater to pre-college, 
residential and lifelong learners 
by the end of 2017.

The initiative was laid out 

this week by James DeVaney, 
associate vice provost for digital 
and engaged education. Estab-
lished last September, the DEI is 
a provost-level office that lever-
ages technology to redevelop the 
teaching and learning space, both 
within and beyond the University.

The DEI has already initiated 

significant changes to class cur-
riculums and pedagogical meth-
ods used by faculty members. The 
Digital Innovation Greenhouse, a 

branch of the DEI, brings togeth-
er faculty members, researchers 
and software developers to devel-
op digital educational tools.

Physics Prof. Timothy McKay, 

the principal investigator of the 
DIG, said he was inspired to start 
the DIG after his own experi-
ences 
developing 
ECoach, 
a 

personalized coaching tool that 
provides individualized feedback 
to students based on their back-
grounds.

Likening the DIG to business 

accelerators, McKay considers 
it the in-between space where 
innovative ideas are solidified 
into digital tools that meet the 
needs of the community.

“There is a whole process 

between an invention and a prod-
uct, or between innovation and 
infrastructure that you need to 
fill somehow,” he said. “What 
we saw was a bunch of digitally 
enabled, good ideas emerging, but 
not being able to become really 
wide-scale projects. We needed a 
place on campus where a faculty 
innovator can take a great idea, 
put it on the table, and work it out 
so that it grows into something 

that can be implemented on a 
broader scale.”

McKay asserts that digital 

tools like ECoach will continue to 
be actively marketed to all faculty 
members.

“As we develop great new 

models that should spread widely 
across campus, communities of 
practice will go out to look for 
people who might benefit from 
this and try to bring them in.”

However, according to Infor-

mation Prof. Barry Fishman, who 
developed GradeCraft, another 
DIG project, combining digital 
innovation with education is not 
always simple. GradeCraft is a 
tool that allows faculty members 
to design their courses using a 
framework 
of 
game-inspired 

learning 
and 
teaching. 
He 

acknowledged the challenge of 
getting people receptive to and 
involved in course reinvention.

“There are always challenges 

when you are trying to change 
teaching or learning practice. 
People are set in their ways and 
it takes effort to change,” he said.

her performance, including HIV/AIDS, sexual abuse and suicide.

his decision to vote in favor of the 
cull.

“It goes without saying that the 

recall process is a critical part of 
democracy,” he said. “That being 
said, in my limited experience 
of recalls, they usually seem to 
involve some kind of extreme 
behavior problem of an elected 
official, not votes on small-budget 
items like we have here. I struggle 
with the concept of using a recall 
in this instance. I suppose the 
inference is that 10 out of 11 coun-
cil members are unfit to serve in 
this person’s view.”

The deer management pro-

gram City Council approved 
is designed in hopes of reduc-
ing the deer population and in 
turn decreasing nuisance to the 
community and supporting bio-
logical diversity. The council 
allocated up to $90,000 for deer 
population management efforts 
over the next four years. Howev-
er, only approximately $35,000 
will be put toward the cull. The 
city also has plans to investigate 
alternative methods for popu-
lation regulation and the Sep-
tember approved resolution also 
provides for further exploration 
and research of deer fertility 
control.

During the cull, sharpshoot-

ers will take out deer at night on 
public property, a move which has 
proven contentious.

At the November meeting in 

which City Council approved the 
cull, approximately 50 speakers, 
spoke in support of or against the 
resolution.

“I live in Ann Arbor near pub-

lic land,” Sanzotta said during 
the meeting. “I am seriously con-
cerned about public safety. Who 
knows what high powered rifles 
are being fired on these animals? I 

don’t think that is something that 
residents should want to allow, for 
public safety reasons.”

Westphal said he understood 

why the decision was controver-
sial, but added that he ultimately 
felt the cull was the only proven 
way to manage the deer overpop-
ulation issue.

“There was a very expensive 

public outreach and research pro-
cess that apparently Council felt 
comfortable with,” he said. “It’s 
clear that nobody loves the idea 
of a deer cull. However I get the 
overwhelming feeling from my 
constituents that most under-
stand this is the only proven way 
to manage the deer and the eco-
system.”

For the Save the Deer group’s 

petition to prevail, it will need to 
be approved by the Washtenaw 
County 
Election 
Commission, 

which next meets Dec. 17.

If approved, the group will 

need to collect signatures from 
1,791 registered Ward 2 voters by 
the end of January. A successful 
petition would force a May run-
off election ahead of the August 
City Council primary, in which 
Westphal will already be up for 
re-election.

The special election would 

determine a new candidate to fill 
the seat before the election.

Sanzotta said the group’s next 

step, after filing the petition, 
would be identifying a candidate 
interested in running for West-
phal’s seat.

This is not Sanzotta’s first 

attempt at ousting a council mem-
ber because of his or her senti-
ments toward the cull.

The Save the Deer group 

worked to defeat council mem-
ber Jane Lumm (I–Ward 2) for 
approving the cull when Lumm 
was up for re-election in Novem-
ber. However, despite Save the 
Deer’s efforts, Lumm was re-
elected last month. 

gravity environment is just 
another example of how peo-
ple do that.”

Seidler’s other work focus-

es on the elderly and patients 
with Parkinson’s. She said 
there are parallels between the 
motor control loss that comes 
with aging and the experi-
ences of astronauts returning 
home.

“There are some age declines 

in the vestibular system that 
can contribute to balance loss, 
so there is a connection there,” 
she said. “I also study how 
people learn new motor skills 

— what are the brain areas that 
are engaged when the brain 
begins to learn motor memory? 
How is this process affected by 
Parkinson’s disease or aging?”

Dean of Kinesiology Ron-

ald Zernicke said he thought 
Seidler’s research touched on 
an interesting part of the tran-
sition period for astronauts. 
He cited, in particular, the 
case of NASA astronaut Scott 
Kelly, who has been in space 
for nearly 400 days — a record-
breaking flight.

“(Kelly) is coming down in 

March, who’s been up there 
for 382 days,” he said. “Your 
depth perception, your memo-
ry, motor control — those can 
all be affected because of the 

lack of gravity and the normal 
way in which the body is func-
tioning. The brain interprets 
signals in space differently in 
some respects, than it does to 
being in gravity.”

Seidler said she is particu-

larly interested in exploring 
how certain brain regions 
change during spaceflight as 
they adapt to different grav-
ity levels. She will explore 
those 
changes 
through 
a 

series of tests on astronauts 
both on Earth and in the 
space station.

“We’re doing a bunch of 

measurements before and after 
astronauts go to the Interna-
tional Space Station,” she said. 
“We’re using MRIs to measure 

brain structures and function. 
We’re measuring their bal-
ance, their functional mobil-
ity and doing a lot of cognitive 
tests. Then while they’re on 
the space station they also do 
some behavioral tests for us, 
some motor tasks that we have 
them do on a computer.”

These measurements and 

tests include obstacle cours-
es to determine how quickly 
they can move over and under 
obstacles as well as cognitive 
tests while under an MRI, a 
scanning device that provides 
a detailed picture of the brain.

Zernicke 
said 
though 

Seidler’s current work relates 
the brain to its environment in 
microgravity, the implications 

of her research could also be 
applied to the brain as it func-
tions on Earth.

“There’s 
still 
so 
much 

unknown associated with the 
brain,” he said. “The more 
you can learn in different con-
texts, the better it will be for 
finding out whether it’s on 
Earth, under different condi-
tions, under adaptations, how 
the brain adapts and responds 
to different kinds of stimu-
li. Microgravity, or being in 
space, is a different stimuli 
than people typically have. 
It’s a unique situation and that 
unique situation can poten-
tially provide some insights in 
terms of how the brain func-
tions.”

Researchers can 
preserve fertility in 
women with cancer

University researchers have 

discovered 
a 
potential 
new 

approach to preserving fertility 
in young cancer patients. 

The researchers, who con-

ducted their research on mice, 
isolated primary ovarian follicles 
and encapsulated these follicles 
in a gel. After this, the follicles 
were reemplanted in the mice. 
All those with transplanted fol-
licles resumed normal ovarian 
cycles and one-third produced 
live births. 

Researchers are also explor-

ing ovarian tissue transplan-
taition for cancer patients. A 
concern with this approach is 
that the tissue may harbor latent 
cancer cells which could be rein-
troduced to the patient upon 
transplantation. 

Current ferility preservation 

methods include embryo or egg 
freezing which are performed 
using hormonal stimulation to 
induce ovulation. Unfortunate-
ly, some patients are too young 
or their cancer is too advanced 
for this treatment to be a viable 
option. 

Famed indie film 
producer donates 
archives to the ‘U’

Renowned film producer Ira 

Deutchman announced Wednes-
day he would donate archives 
spanning his 40-year film career 
to the University’s Screen Arts 
Mavericks & Makers collection.

As founder of the companies 

Cinecom and Fine Line Fea-
tures, Deutchman has produced 
more than 150 films, including 
the critically acclaimed works 
“Matewan,” “The Player” and 
“sex, lies, and videotape”.

His donation to the Univer-

sity will include personal docu-
ments, 
e-mails, 
photographs 

and memorabilia from art house 
exhibits, the earliest dating back 
to the early 1970s.

In addition to being a film 

studies professor at Columbia 
University School of the Arts, 
Deutchman works as an indepen-
dent producer and consultant in 
independent film marketing and 
production. As a consultant, he 
has represented companies pro-
ducing a variety of film genres 
including documentaries, operas 
and ballets.

In a statement, Deutchman 

said he believes his contribution 
will add depth to the study and 
discussion of the independent 
cinema industry.

“I believe that it is important 

to understand the role of market-
ers, distributors, exhibitors and 
curators in the support and cre-
ation of film culture in the U.S.,” 
he said. “Without that part of 
the independent film ecosystem, 
it’s hard to imagine how these 
maverick filmmakers could have 
survived. By bringing this part 
of the discussion to their collec-
tion, the University of Michigan 
is making a huge contribution 
to the study of independent cin-
ema.”

lish promise zones to benefit 
their students, but have been 
unable to because state law 
limits the zones to 10 districts.

“We know that education 

is a driver of our economy, 
and we know that in certain 
areas, it’s a little bit more dif-
ficult to attain high educa-
tion,” McGarry said. “I really 
think this benefits the state 
as a whole: Not only are we 
offering a higher education, 
but if people know that they 
have the promise option for 
their children, I think, long 
term, we would see more peo-
ple coming into communities 
— potentially housing values 
could increase — because peo-
ple want to send their kids to a 
district where they know that 
they’re going to have college 
afterwards.”

McGarry also noted that 

some promise zones, especially 
Baldwin Community Schools, 
have already been successful at 
increasing college or technical 
school enrollment.

“Starting 
with 
the 
first 

promise zone in Kalamazoo, 
communities have witnessed 
a positive impact in providing 
tuition support for students,” 
she said. “Not every zone 
works in exactly the same way 
and the funding for the zones 
can vary. The expansion of 
promise zones appears to fur-
ther enhance the ability of stu-
dents and families to consider 
higher education or other post-

secondary options. That’s cer-
tainly an effort we support.”

McGarry said this flexibility 

is a positive, because it allows 
locals to decide what is best for 
their communities.

“This program doesn’t work 

in every community, but for 
locals that want to garner the 
private investment to get this off 
the ground, this gives them the 
ability to do that,” she said. “Let’s 
give more communities the abil-
ity to take advantage of it.”

Both Mooney and McGarry 

noted that 0539 and 0540’s 
more technical changes to pre-
vious legislation would increase 
the accountability of the pro-
gram. Districts would have sev-
eral years to receive treasury 
approval and begin granting 
scholarships before their char-
ters would be revoked for lack 
of success. The treasury would 
then give the next district on 
a waiting list the mandate to 
begin its own program, and 
all zones would be required to 
include mechanisms for track-
ing degree completion in their 
program design.

Mooney cited the decision 

of Jackson Public Schools, one 
of the 10 original promise zone 
districts, to terminate its pro-
gram last year due to fundrais-
ing constraints as the catalyst 
for Bill 0539. She said there 
lacked a system in the original 
promise zones legislation that 
specified how the state could 
replace that school district with 
another.

“Treasury didn’t believe that 

it specified in (previous legis-
lation) how to dissolve a zone 

if (Jackson) chose to and what 
happens to the dollars that 
they’ve raised — so that’s what 
we are trying to codify and 
clarify in Senate Bill 0539,” she 
said. “And when Jackson chose 
to dissolve, there are others on 
this waiting list that applied 
back in 2009, and Treasury 
believed there needed to be 
clarification in statute in order 
for them to certify or designate 
another eligible entity to be a 
zone.”

Bill 0540 is a technical bill 

that allows state-raised funds 
to be funneled directly to the 
promise zone programs, as 
opposed to through an inter-
mediary such as the school dis-
trict.

After the testimonies, the 

committee 
engaged 
with 

Mooney and McGarry for 
clarification on specific parts 
of the two bills and some rep-
resentatives raised concerns 
about how state and district-
level funds are appropriated 
for these programs.

Specifically, Rep. Jeff Far-

rington 
(R–Utica) 
asked 

Mooney and McGarry why the 
number of promise zones in the 
state should be limited at all.

“Why are we moving from 

10 to 15 instead of unlimiting 
it?” Farrington said. “If it’s 
good for Baldwin, Flint, Battle 
Creek, whomever else, why not 
for the whole state?”

Mooney said it is prudent for 

the state to increase the num-
ber of permissible zones slow-
ly, because these programs 
do use state funds to provide 
scholarships.

diversity of the student body,

Pathways is a pipeline program 
targeted at middle and high 
school students in two metro 
Detroit area school districts that 
would also yield four-year tuition

Harper also spoke about the 

University’s 
Comprehensive 

Studies Program, which offers 
students from under-resourced 
high schools, underrepresented 
minorities and first-generation 
students extra resources to suc-
ceed.

“If you’ve always done well it 

sort of dons on you late that you 
might need some additional sup-
port,” Harper said. “We think 
part of the Michigan challenge is 
to try to normalize help-seeking 
behavior.”

Sexual assault 

investigation procedures

LSA senior Kendal Rosalik, 

who said she is a survivor of sex-
ual misconduct, was one of the 
students who received an e-mail 
from University Title XI Coordi-
nator Anthony Whalesby and the 
Office of Student Conflict Resolu-
tion when the draft sexual mis-
conduct policy was distributed to 
students. The e-mail asked stu-
dents to share their experiences, 
make suggestions and attend pol-
icy roundtables.

“I was a little bit alarmed by the 

fact that there was not a survivor-
specific roundtable after asking 
me to share my experiences in an 
e-mail that looked like a generic 
e-mail,” Rosalik said. “There was 
no indication of what the content 

of that e-mail was going to be and 
no indication that the content of 
that e-mail was going to be con-
tacting me because I was a survi-
vor that reported.”

Rosalik said she wrote a 

10-page 
paper 
offering 
her 

thoughts on the policy and 
offered to meet with both OSCR 
and the Title IX coordina-
tor’s office, but never received a 
response. She voiced specific con-
cern with the lack of transpar-
ency the policy provides in the 
investigation of reports of sexual 
assault on campus.

In an interview after the event, 

she noted that the University’s 
investigation process — dur-
ing which a University-assigned 
investigator separately gathers 
information from both the sur-
vivor and perpetrator of alleged 
assault — lacks transparency 
because it is not clear how the 
investigator implements current 
policy to decide which party to 
trust.

She said the ineffectiveness 

of this process is illustrated by 
data from the University’s cam-
pus climate survey, noting that 
just under 4 percent of all victims 
of sexual assault at the Univer-
sity were reported to someone at 
the University for the 2013-2014 
academic year. Additionally, she 
said, only four alleged perpetra-
tors were found guilty of sexual 
assault on campus, with two 
cases pending.

“We can do the work, students 

and activists, to make this a bet-
ter policy, but there’s not a lot that 
we can do around the transpar-
ency of that policy,” Rosalik said. 
“What would you suggest we do 
to make that a more transparent 
process for survivors?”

Schlissel said he was surprised 

there was no survivor-specific 
mode of outreach concerning 
the drafting of the sexual assault 

policy, and apologized for the 
insensitivity of the e-mail she 
received. He further acknowl-
edged the challenge of investiga-
tive transparency, and said the 
University is open to suggestions 
for improvement in that regard.

Divestment from 

fossil fuels

The question of divestment 

from fossil fuels also sparked 
debate at Thursday’s event. One 
LSA sophomore brought up the 
fact that the University cur-
rently invests $1 billion in fossil 
fuel-related industries. One stu-
dent asked whether there exists 
a point when the consequences 
of investing in fossil fuels would 
outweigh any benefits. A pro-
posal to support the formation 
of a committee to consider fossil 
fuel divestment was passed by 
the University’s Senate Advisory 
Committee on University Affairs 
last month.

Schlissel responded that the 

University is dedicated to sus-
tainability and efforts to curb 
climate change, citing the Uni-
versity’s Graham Sustainability 
Institute, extensive sustainability 
research, environmental science 
course offerings and philan-
thropic efforts targeted at envi-
ronmental causes.

He 
additionally 
reaffirmed 

the University’s commitment to 
reducing environmental harm 
by reminding the audience of 
the University’s recent $80 mil-
lion investment in a natural gas-
driven turbine or co-generation 
turbine, which makes electricity 
and steam at high efficiency and 
is expected to decrease the Uni-
versity’s carbon footprint by 20 
percent.

On the topic of divestment, 

Schlissel said he is against divest-
ing due to its anticipated ineffec-
tiveness in actually diverting the 
energy market from fossil fuels.

“If you could convince me that 

the University of Michigan shift-
ing its investment portfolio away 
from fossil fuel companies would 
actually hasten our transition to 
renewables, then I’d think about 
it,” Schlissel said. “But I think 
that the strongest arguments that 
have been made so far is that it’s 
an important symbolic action 
because burning fossil fuels is bad 
for the environment.”

Schlissel said he would rather 

see students lobby the Michigan 
state legislature instead of the 
University on the topic of fossil 
fuel divestment. At the Univer-
sity level, he said, divestment is 
“mostly symbolic action.”

“If it diminishes the perfor-

mance of our endowment and our 
ability to pay for all the things 
here that we want to pay for and 
it doesn’t hasten our conversion 
away from fossil fuels, it doesn’t 
make sense to me,” he added.

The student responded that 

divesting in fossil fuel industries 
would not only be a symbolic 
gesture, but also an initial step 
in igniting a culture shift toward 
reducing environmental harm. 
He also said the University could 
influence donors not to have their 
money invested in the fossil fuel 
industry.

Student debt

During the chat, a Medical 

School student who said she car-
ries a significant amount of stu-
dent debt voiced concern with the 
University’s average amount of 
debt within the medical student 
population. She said the current 
number is skewed because a large 
portion of medical students have 
no debt, while a large portion of 
others have a significant amount 
of debt.

She also noted that continu-

ing to raise tuition poses a unique 
threat to medical students, as it is 
virtually impossible to transfer 

medical schools.

Schlissel responded that the 

University’s main focus is and 
remains on undergraduate stu-
dent debt and less so graduate 
and professional students, least of 
all medical and law students.

“It’s not that it’s unimport-

ant, but when you’re training for 
a profession, it’s a different type 
of thinking than receiving an 
undergraduate basic education,” 
Schlissel said.

“The reason why you can accu-

mulate that much debt is because 
the people loaning you the money 
appreciate the fact that there’s 
no unemployment among physi-
cians,” he added. “You will pay it 
back.”

University grading 

policies

About halfway through the 

event, Schlissel posed a question 
to those in attendance: “Does 
Michigan seem the same or more 
competitive among students than 
you thought it would be?”

Students’ 
reactions 
were 

mixed, with the general consen-
sus that, in classes graded on a 
curve, peer competition and high 
tension are more evident.

Schlissel then asked students if 

they thought an absolute grading 
system, as opposed to a curve, 
would be a more effective form 
of evaluation.

One medical student, argu-

ing in favor of an absolute grad-
ing system, said curves are 
detrimental to students whose 
grades fall below the average 
— and are subsequently curved 
down.

Similarly, 
other 
respon-

dents were mostly in favor of 
absolute grading, identifying a 
curve as a significant source of 
stress and competition. Schlis-
sel acknowledged both the 
positives and negatives to the 
curved grading system.

Look for the helpers

“What is the world coming to?” 

my 70-year-old grandmother asked 
during our conversation about the 
recent terrorist attack in Paris. The 
scenes of carnage in a city she’s 
visited many times prompted her 
to reminisce, with fond nostalgia, 
on the immensely different world 
she grew up in — a world where 
everyone supposedly left their doors 
unlocked and violence was nowhere 
near as common as it is today.

Statistically speaking, these rosy 

memories are fallacious. Contrary 
to popular belief, we’re currently 
living in the most peaceful time 
in human history. Homicide rates, 
sexual assault rates and war deaths 
are a record low across the globe.

Despite 
these 
improvements, 

it remains easy to feel cynical 
about the direction the world is 
heading in because much work is 
still needed to make our planet a 
safer place. These negative feelings 
become 
especially 
pronounced 

after disaster, because it’s often 
forgotten that after a particularly 
bad storm, you can expect to find a 
rainbow. Or, in the words of Mister 
Rogers, after a disaster, “Look for 
the helpers. You will always find 
people who are helping.”

Fourteen years ago, the United 

States watched in horror as the 
World Trade Center fell to the 
ground and into our collective 
memory. The images from Sept. 
11 are not only some of the most 
powerful of the 21st century, but 
also among the most powerful in 

global history. They joined the 
powerful group of media snippets 
— paintings of people suffering 
from the bubonic plague, pictures 
from the firing on Fort Sumter and 
videos of Hitler’s first speech as 
chancellor, to name a few — that 
captured events that went on to 
permanently alter the trajectory of 
foreign and domestic policy.

To 
most, 
these 
images 
of 

disaster represent nothing more 
than negative scars on our history. 
However, what isn’t shown in these 
pictures is the aid and support that 
poured in after the cameras were 
put down. While photos from Sept. 
11 are full of death and despair, 
photos from Sept. 12 tell a vastly 
different and more uplifting story.

The day after the towers came 

down, the world stood together in 
solidarity to show that it supported 
New York and to the mourn the loss 
of those who died in the attacks. 
Millions of dollars of aid money 
poured into the city — money that 
everyday working families had 
earned and had every right to keep. 
Yet, they found it within themselves 
to put aside their wants and needs 
for someone else’s benefit.

Over the decade and a half that 

followed, similar scenarios have 
played out across the globe. The 2004 
South Asian tsunami, Hurricane 
Katrina, 
Haitian 
and 
Japanese 

earthquakes, the Gulf Oil Spill and 
the Ebola crisis are all rightfully 
branded as disasters, and all of these 
events were seen by some as a sort 

of omen signaling that times are 
getting worse. Yet these events ended 
with people from all over the world 
coming together to help the victims, 
a fact that is overlooked all too often.

Here we are today, looking at 

Paris and asking ourselves how we 
keep letting this happen. It’s easy to 
ask, “What is the world coming to?” 
while we ignore all of the love that 
flowed into the city after the hateful 
acts. During the attacks, many 
people risked their own lives to 
save the lives of people they didn’t 
know. After the attacks, the world 
supported Paris by sending moral 
support and engaging in other acts 
of kindness. For example, Airbnb, a 
popular service that allows people 
to rent their homes to travelers, 
provided homes for Parisians in 
need of a place to stay. Acts like 
these were common, but were 
outshadowed by the negativity that 
followed the attacks.

This isn’t to say we shouldn’t 

discuss tragedies when they strike 
— we definitely should. However, 
when we have these discussions, 
we shouldn’t forget to look for the 
helpers who inevitably arrive when 
the smoke settles, the individuals 
who continue to prove that most 
people do not have hate in their 
hearts. If not, we might leave the 
discussion with a more cynical 
view of the world than what 
 

actually exists.

— President Barack Obama said in an interview with CBS correspondent Norah O’Donnell 

on Dec. 2 about the mass shooting in San Bernardino, CA.

“

NOTABLE QUOTABLE

We should never think 
that this is something 
that just happens in the 
ordinary course of events, 
because it doesn’t happen 
with the same frequency 

in other countries.”

JASON ROWLAND | VIEWPOINT

Blame it on our generation?

 Do you remember what happened 

at the University of Connecticut 
a few months ago? A kid pulled a 
total “college bro move,” but it was 
taken to an extreme. He was drunk, 
but also turned out to be underage. 
In the process of the student 
demanding the famous jalapeño 
bacon mac and cheese from one 
of the school cafeterias, he was 
physically restrained by two of the 
cafeteria managers after repeatedly 
pushing one of them. The student 
was clearly intoxicated. Student 
bystanders quickly busted out their 
camera phones, and the whole thing 
went viral on YouTube. 

There are so many problems 

in this one incident. First of all, 
the disrespect displayed by the 
students 
toward 
the 
cafeteria 

manager is simply hard to watch. 
Yes, the student was under the 
influence, and we all get that 
sudden craving of food when we 
feel a bit tipsy, right? But this isn’t 
something normal or OK. Not only 
does the student repeatedly swear 
at someone who works for him 
day and night, but he also clearly 
shows he believes the manager is of 
a lower rank of some kind, simply 
because he is a cafeteria manager.

A teenager looks down upon 

a man around the age of his par-
ents because of his occupation. We 
might all be hesitant to admit this is 
true, but this happens far too often. 
Some of us nonchalantly poke fun at 
people with more laborious occupa-

tions, such as janitors or cafeteria 
managers. It may all be fun and jokes 
until this disrespect manifests itself, 
especially in an educational environ-
ment, where we are meant to learn to 
become respectful citizens. Janitor 
jokes and lunch-lady jokes, where we 
either consciously or unconsciously 
consider them inferior solely based 
on what their subjects do for a living, 
aren’t the type of laughs we should be 
sharing as adults.

What else went wrong here?
If you checked YouTube when 

it happened, there were, and still 
probably 
are, 
countless 
videos 

of the same incident, taken from 
several different angles. Everyone 
at the cafeteria found this drunk 
student demanding some mac and 
cheese amusing enough to record it 
on video and shamelessly upload to 
the Internet.

But if you watch any version of the 

video, hardly anyone present jumps 
in to break up the situation, not 
to mention at least try to calm the 
drunk student down before things 
escalated. While nobody there may 
have instigated or directly taken 
part in, it’s concerning that nobody 
tried to step in and take action 
to prevent things from going so 
far south. People were recording 
it on their phones, laughing and 
generally drawing an unnecessary 
amount of attention to the incident.

Finally, someone who seemed to 

be a fellow school employee tried to 
tell the student to leave the prem-

ises. But the drunk student didn’t 
listen, and the police had to show 
up to put an end to the situation.

I can’t guarantee I would have 

been courageous enough to stop the 
student from going crazy, but I can 
definitely admit that pulling out my 
phone to share this with the world 
wouldn’t have been the first thing on 
my mind if I was there. Maybe the 
atmosphere or the cultural ambience 
of college has set a deep-rooted tone 
or sense of humor that makes us find 
incidents like this funny, and so we 
let them happen and laugh at them. 
However, as adults, most, if not all of 
us should be concerned if anything 
like this were to happen around us. 
In the case that it does, at least some 
of us should be able to be in the video 
as the “party poopers” and spoil 
 

the “fun.”

Ever since the introduction of 

social media, everything is very 
short-lived. The memes we see on 
Facebook, the hilarious videos on 
YouTube and all the Internet good-
ies don’t stay with us for longer 
than a week; at least in my case. 
So naturally, people already forgot 
about this Internet sensation.

To whoever is reading this, 

I apologize for digging this old 
topic back out. But we could learn 
a few things from this happening. 
Besides, how good could that mac 
and cheese really be?

FROM THE DAILY

AD search must include students

The next Athletic Director should prioritize diversity, inclusion
T

he University confirmed Wednesday that the search for a 
permanent athletic director has begun and that interim 
Athletic Director Jim Hackett does not wish to be considered 

for the position. For better or worse, the University’s reputation is 
intertwined with athletic success, affecting all community members, 
including student-athletes, student-fans and even students who don’t 
care about athletics. Following the disastrous tenure of former Athletic 
Director Dave Brandon and a remarkable past 13 months with Hackett 
as interim Athletic Director, the University must be diligent in finding 
an applicant who’s committed not only to maintaining Hackett’s 
success, but also to increasing diversity and promoting inclusion in the 
Athletic Department. Furthermore, the University must keep in mind 
students from across campus — not just ones who are passionate about 
sports — to ensure all perspectives are taken into account in the search 
for a new athletic director.

The University cannot afford to hire 

another Dave Brandon. Despite his ties to 
the University as an alum and former regent, 
Brandon’s 
mismanagement 
of 
multiple 

situations outweighed any of the positive 
contributions he made as Athletic Director. 
Brandon’s mishandling of quarterback Shane 
Morris’ concussion — which included a press 
release sent at 1 a.m. and statements that 
contradicted former football coach Brady 
Hoke — was abysmal. During Brandon’s 
tenure, former football kicker Brendan 
Gibbons was allowed to play a game on 
Nov. 23, 2013 after being found responsible 
for a 2009 sexual misconduct allegation by 
the Office of Student Conflict Resolution 
on Nov. 20, 2013; a change to the Student 
Sexual Misconduct Policy in 2011 allowed 
the incident to be investigated by the Office 
of Institutional Equity, which resulted in 
Gibbons’ “permanent separation” from the 
University. Brandon also reportedly wrote 
denigrating e-mails to alumni, neglected 
to involve students in numerous important 
decisions regarding athletics and raised 
student ticket prices to astronomically high 
levels. Ultimately, under his leadership, the 
Athletic Department became more about the 
bottom line than heart and tradition.

Enter 
Jim 
Hackett, 
the 
Athletic 

Department’s soul doctor. Hackett became 
the interim Athletic Director in October 
2014, heading a department in disarray. In 
his first decisions as director, Hackett fired 
an unsatisfactory football coach, hired the 
dream coach the Michigan fan base wanted 
and orchestrated a $169 million deal with 
Nike. Growing up in an atmosphere that 
promoted deep respect for coaching and 
sports, Hackett has routinely supported all 
athletes and coaches throughout the past 
year. In an open letter after Michigan’s last-
second loss to Michigan State on Oct. 17, 
Hackett condemned the violent comments 
directed at Michigan punter Blake O’Neill, 
who made a mistake in the last play of the 
game. Hackett’s demeanor and attitude 

about the job is admirable. Continuing this 
culture of respect, financial success and 
understanding of tradition is an imperative 
task for the next athletic director.

In a conference call with local media 

outlets Wednesday, University President 
Mark Schlissel said, “I’m looking for the 
best person for the job. It is a $151 million 
enterprise. It’s a complex enterprise that 
requires somebody with business accounting 
and leadership skills and experience.” These 
skills, along with an understanding of college 
athletic departments, which Schlissel also 
mentioned as a criterium, should be the 
baseline requirements.

The new athletic director must have 

an unwavering commitment to increasing 
diversity and inclusion at the University. The 
Athletic Department has immense influence 
in steering campus culture and should 
feel a responsibility in providing students 
of all backgrounds with a full University 
experience. This begins by making student 
tickets more affordable. Earlier this year, a 
need-based reduced price ticket program 
for football, basketball and hockey was 
implemented for students who receive Pell 
grants. The new athletic director should 
work to expand this program to include more 
low-income students, not for just those on 
Pell grants. Furthermore, student discounts 
at M-Den locations should be implemented 
to allow every student to show school spirit 
affordably.

Currently, the search committee consists 

of eight indviduals including a coach, a 
current and former student-athlete, a faculty 
representative, a member of Schlissel’s 
special 
counsel, 
the 
University’s 
chief 

financial officer and the current medical 
director at Renown Rehabilitation Center in 
Reno, Nev. Though Schlissel and Hackett said 
during the conference call they will make it 
a priority to seek student opinions, it should 
be done formally in open forums or meetings. 
In these forums, there must be a deliberate 
effort to include students of all backgrounds.

‘Empire’ falters 
in second season

Mediocre storylines 
hurt Fox drama at 
mid-season finale

By CHRISTIAN KENNEDY

Daily Arts Writer

At the sophomore season mid-

point of “Empire,” a week of quick 
changes come to a close. First, 
Cookie 
(Tar-

aji P. Henson, 
“The 
Curious 

Case of Benja-
min 
Button”) 

was taking over 
Empire, 
then 

she 
creates 

her own com-
pany. Hakeem 
(Bryshere Gray) 
has PTSD from 
his kidnapping, 
then he doesn’t. Jamal (Jussie 
Smollett) is gay, then he kisses a 
girl. “Empire” ’s second season 
thus far has been riddled with 
half-played-out storylines. That, 
coupled with an inconsistent sup-
porting cast, has taken a once-
glossy primetime soap and dulled 
it down to its lackluster bits.

The root of “Empire” ’s prob-

lem is the mediocre prix-fixe 
menu of storylines. You can’t pick 
and choose which ones you want 
and none of the courses are all 
that great. The problematic writ-
ing reflects onto the characters 
and the show’s overall quality. 
The condemnable lack of ensem-
ble scenes due to fragmented sto-
rylines came to a mass collision 
in Wednesday’s episode, leav-
ing viewers with even more new 
questions than answers.

The Lyons no longer have rap-

port with supporting cast, most 
of which have come and gone 
sporadically. A three-dimension-
al Tianna (Serayah McNeill), 
likeable Onika (Grace Gealey) 
and stunning Elle Dallas (Court-
ney Love, “The People v. Larry 

Flynt”) have been replaced with 
Marisa Tomei’s painstakingly 
boring lesbian venture capitalist 
Mimi Whiteman. Tomei’s talent, 
paired with Whiteman’s charac-
ter description, lends itself well 
to the submissive tone emulated 
throughout the first season. But 
ultimately, Mimi Whiteman and 
the lack of non-Lyon charac-
ter development highlight the 
show’s dragging plot.

Though “Empire” isn’t down 

for the count quite yet. There 
are still moments of magic that 
sparked viewers’ passion dur-
ing season one. The chemistry 
between Alicia Keys and Jussie 
Smollett is unbearably infectious, 
despite the show’s unwilling-
ness to define their relationship. 
Cookie’s speech at the women’s 
prison, albeit unoriginal, felt gen-
uine and Hakeem’s subsequent 
prison performance was one of 
the season’s strongest.

As the first installment of sea-

son two closes, “Empire” once 
again re-enters the “who’s gonna 
win the kingdom” storyline that 
has been looped in throughout 

its lifetime; there has just been 
another shuffling of teams. Ulti-
mately, the season closes with its 
worst and best choices. A preg-
nant Rhonda (Kaitlin Doubleday) 
was pushed down the stairs (pre-
sumably by a psychotic and also 
pregnant Onika), consequently 
throwing a wrench in one of the 
season’s few well-functioning 
storylines. And Lucious’s (Ter-
rence Howard, “Iron Man”) long-
awaited 
humanization 
comes 

after Hakeem casts the decid-
ing vote to remove his father 
as CEO of Empire. His break-
down, complete with gunfire, 
tears and a comforting Cookie 
hopefully mark a turn for 
“Empire” ’s course.

“Empire” — the “Empire” that 

broke records and captivated 
viewers last season — is in the 
second season’s fall finale some-
where. Out of focus and hidden 
behind the copious amounts of 
plot, the drama’s true potential 
is kept afloat by the talent of the 
cast and the show’s character 
dynamics, but it will soon be in 
danger of drowning within itself.

BOOK REVIEW

Dramatic ‘Witches’

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

Stacy Schiff’s “The Witches: 

Salem, 1692” is the kind of book 
you forget isn’t fiction.

Though it’s a 

bit long for those 
not 
already 

acquainted with 
Salem 
schol-

arship, 
“The 

Witches” is still 
accessible. 
It 

chronicles 
the 

beginning of the 
Salem hysteria, 
follows the esca-
lation of the tri-
als to fever pitch 
and addresses the eerie silence that 
followed the 19 executions of the 
“witches.” Reading these stories 
feels like watching a play — a seri-
ous, sometimes unwittingly and 
darkly humorous play.

It began with a group of young 

girls having fits and accusing 
neighbors of witchcraft. Accused 
witches either denied the charges 
— effectively signing their own 
death warrants — or confessed 
and named other witches in turn. 
The “afflicted” girls, as they were 
known, rapidly became Salem’s 
darlings. Ministers and other 
leaders of the town hung on their 
every word, tracked the quick, 
darting movements of their eyes 
in the courtroom and shrugged 
helplessly as the girls screamed 
and contorted their bodies in 
pews, crying out that they were 
being pricked by the specters of 
witches they had named.

Schiff includes stories about 

family feuds, adulterous relation-
ships with servants, jealous spouses 
and the transparent machinations 
of petulant teenagers. They startle 
you into realizing the colonists of 
Massachusetts Bay lived with the 
same kind of subtle social politics 
we do now. For better or for worse, 
these accounts make the fantas-
tic events of Salem relatable to our 
own lives. They increase the length 
of the work as a whole, and some-
times teeter on the edge of being 
extraneous. But they flesh out the 
story that, historically, is too often 
chalked up to a fluke year of frantic 
religious fanaticism.

The creative retelling of these 

tales is also where Schiff’s sense 
of humor glints through the lines. 
For example, she observes that 
becoming an “afflicted” girl often 
meant not having to milk the cows 
(or do any of the other chores that 
plagued Puritan girls from dawn 
to dusk). Schiff is also completely 
aware of her audience, slyly slip-
ping in references to “Harry Pot-
ter” and “The Wizard of Oz” in 
the footnotes.

She also illustrates how reli-

gion was present in every aspect 
of the colonists’ lives and how this 
created an environment where 
accusations of and hysteria about 
witchcraft could (and did) spread 
like wildfire. Witchcraft and reli-
gion were inextricably linked; acts 
of sorcery were conflated with her-
esy. Witchcraft implied a contract 
with the devil.

In studies of American history, 

women have often been relegated 
to paragraphs within chapters. But 

it’s undeniable that women were 
the central characters in the Salem 
witch trials — they were the major-
ity of the accusers and the accused. 
Schiff’s analysis of the witch trials 
through a gendered lens is incred-
ibly astute without being dismis-
sive of the other influences that 
played a role. Over the years, there 
have been several lenses through 
which people have viewed and 
interpreted the Salem witch trials, 
and Schiff manages to incorporate 
many of them.

It’s impossible for us to ever have 

a fully comprehensive understand-
ing of what transpired in Salem in 
1692. Our primary sources are 
limited; we have access to death 
warrants, preliminary hearings 
and confessions, but that’s about 
it. Though Puritan girls in Massa-
chusetts Bay were more educated 
than others of their demographic 
at the time, none of them left jour-
nals or diaries.

Schiff’s book is deceptively 

accessible. It reads like a novel, but 
it represents painstaking historical 
research and the putting together 
of a thousand-piece puzzle — of 
which a few pieces are forever lost 
to us. The witchcraft trials repre-
sented a bizarre amalgam of gender 
and class politics, religious fervor 
and adolescent strains that culmi-
nated in the hanging of 19 people. 
Schiff captures and communicates 
this complexity to us, but she also 
acknowledges that no matter how 
far we strain to reach back through 
time, there are some mysteries in 
our history that will always elude 
us, just ever so slightly out of reach. 
Salem, 1692 is one of them.

and Company

Hanoian found work as an 

organist in Washington, D.C. 
and, in 2007, became the con-
ductor at Christ Church Grosse 
Pointe 
in 
Michigan 
before 

accepting the conductor position 
at the University.

“I applied and part of the job 

description is conducting the 
annual performance of Handel’s 
Messiah in Hill Auditorium,” 
Hanoian said. “That was one of 
the projects that drew to me to 
the position as the conductor of 
the choral union as a whole.”

While the story of “Messiah” 

is rife with Christian imagery, 
Hanoian stressed that the story 
can be appreciated by people of 
all faiths.

“You can take the raw emo-

tion away from the person itself 
and apply that to your own faith 
and your own journey throughout 
your spirituality,” Hanoian said.

In Handel’s “Messiah,” the 

religious imagery is not the main 
selling point, but rather the sheer 
range 
of 
emotions 
explored 

throughout the work.

“Handel has created those 

emotions through music in ways 
that the human experience can’t 

express in any other way, and I 
think that’s one of the reasons the 
community supports it year after 
year, and that people keep com-
ing to the piece year after year,” 
Hanoian said.

Those well versed in music the-

ory will appreciate Handel’s inno-
vative use of musical keys. The 
performance begins in E minor, 
a foreboding key that represents 
the uncertainty of the world 
before the birth of Christ. The 
triumphant climax of the perfor-
mance — the Hallelujah chorus — 
is in D major.

“D major is the triumphant 

key,” Hanoian said. “In baroque 
music, when you arrive at D major, 
there’s usually trumpets and tim-
pani involved, and when trum-
pets and timpani are involved, it’s 
usually something that’s heroic 
and majestic.”

The change in key through-

out the performance mirrors 
the emotional journey that runs 
through the story.

“The way the piece evolves to 

arise in D major is always fun to 
see,” Hanoian said. “Most music 
starts and ends in the same key. 
This is not one of those pieces; 
it starts in E minor and ends in 
D major.”

Hanoian has inherited a choral 

group that is incredibly versatile, 

having performed with sym-
phony orchestras from Detroit, 
Ann Arbor, Toledo and even San 
Francisco.

“One of the things that’s a 

unique challenge for me is that 
they’ve done ‘Messiah’ for so 
many years and they’ve had dif-
ferent conductors throughout 
the years,” Hanoian said. “Every 
conductor brings their own … 
interpretation of what Handel 
wanted. I think what the unique 
challenge is for me, as my first 
year, is introducing new perspec-
tives of the work ‘Messiah’ to the 
Choral Union and seeing how 
they react to all of that, and to see 
how some things that have been 
ingrained in them over the years 
may or may not change from one 
year to the next.”

In addition to its adaptability, 

another strength of the Univer-
sity Choral Union is its intermin-
gling of people of all ages who 
work together to create a great 
work of art.

“One of the intergenerational 

things that excels in (the group) 
is having someone who’s sung 
‘Messiah’ 
with 
someone 
for 

whom this may be a brand new 
piece,” Hanoian said. “To have 
the experienced singers mentor-
ing and leading the younger ones 
is always a wonderful thing.”

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

Tasty musical meals

By CARLY SNIDER

Daily Arts Writer

Music is like food — deli-

cious, satisfying and necessary 
to live. Those who try to abstain 
are depriving themselves of vital 
nutrients. Those who only par-
take in junk are doing their souls 
a disservice. Just like music, food 
is simultaneously universal and 
extremely varied. It can be dif-
ficult to craft but is even more 
pleasurable to consume. Presenta-
tion is important. It is an art that 
has been practiced and perfected 
for millennia and one that is con-
tinually advancing. A chef mak-
ing a multi-course meal is akin to 
a musician constructing a setlist: 
following a predetermined agen-
da to maximize the consumers’ 
enjoyment.

First, some pre-dinner drinks. 

In the musical realm, these are 
tracks that loosen up listeners and 
wet the palate, something unas-
suming but enticing. It can be 
fruity or rich, but it needs a kick. 
Deptford Goth’s “Union” is the 
perfect cocktail — the soundscape 
is dense, the lyrics are sultry and 
the beat is progressive. It can be 
consumed passively or with vigor, 
just like a fine glass of wine.

Next, the appetizer. This course 

should build off of the mood 
established by the initial musical 
tasting, adding another dimen-
sion to the experience. It may be 
a good time to draw listeners in 
with a fan-favorite, bringing up 
sensory memories of pleasant 
pasts. Make them feel comfort-
able before throwing them into 
the main course. A tasty appetizer 
might consist of Marina and the 
Diamonds’s “Froot,” a bubblegum-
lacquered pop track bursting with 
innuendo. Marina’s voice com-
mands attention without being 
powerful enough to overshadow 
what is to come, like a light but fla-
vorful soup.

The main course, the focal point 

of the evening. This is the art-
ists’s time to shine, to truly show 
their ingenuity and skill. Gener-
ally lengthier and heartier than 
any of the previous presentations, 
the main course may span mul-
tiple tracks. They should play off 
of each other, both through simi-
larity and distinction. The songs 
could be lengthened, remixed or 
mashed up. Whatever the method, 
there has to be a standout moment 
— an unforgettable culmination 
of sensory stimulation. It could be 
anything from the first bite, tip-

ping diners off to the delectabil-
ity to come, or the final mouthful, 
making the art of what they have 
just experienced apparent. A main 
course combo might consist of 
“Call Your Girlfriend” by Robyn 
moving into “Empathy” by Crystal 
Castles, topped off with “Alive” by 
Sia, creating quite a colorful plate.

Wrapping it up, a little some-

thing sweet. Mirroring the inten-
sity of the appetizer, dessert 
should ensure that the evening 
leaves the recipients of art full but 
not over-satiated, pleasantly fed 
but not lethargic. The taste left 
in their mouths should be one of 
simultaneous satisfaction and of a 
longing for more. Like a delicately 
whipped chocolate mousse, Arc-
tic Monkeys’s “Why’d You Only 
Call Me When You’re High?” is 
the perfect cap to any evening. 
The dessert should create an air of 
possibility, a sense that the night is 
still young, that there will always 
be more art to consume.

The streams of art run deep. No 

matter how different the forms, 
the emotive and personal nature 
of creation runs through all medi-
ums. Whether an album or a salad, 
a new single or an individual take 
on a classic dish, art is made to be 
consumed.

TV NOTEBOOK
Fallon transcendent

By SHIR AVINADAV

Daily Arts Writer

When my mother and I sit down 

to watch TV, as with any family, 
there’s typically some contention 
over which program to watch. 
She’ll put up a fight against what-
ever sitcom is playing on a mara-
thon loop and objects to the 
reruns of “Keeping Up With The 
Kardashians” that constantly air. 
After I berate her for her devo-
tion to “The Voice” and sensa-
tionalized local news, we finally 
settle on yet another episode of 
“Friends” or some Katherine 
Heigl movie that’s already half-
way through its airtime.

Yet, since I’ve gone off to college, 

every time I return home, we sit 
down every night promptly at 10:30 
p.m. armed with snacks and mugs 
of tea to watch “The Tonight Show 
Starring Jimmy Fallon.” What is it 
about this charismatic host and the 
series of parodies, celebrity guests 
and viral sketches that prompts my 
mom and I to overcome our differ-
ences and dedicate over an hour to 
watch his show? The same ques-
tion can be asked of his nearly 3.9 
million viewers.

Late night talk shows — a staple 

in many American homes — are 
more than just a reflection of the 
nation’s cultural climate. They’re 
a ubiquitous part of the nightly 
routine of viewers who — com-
forted by the regular presence of 
witty hosts carefully selected by 
networks — are a living part of 
the long tradition of late night TV 
dating back to the ’50s. With the 
succession of new late night talk 
show hosts in recent years, it’s 
important to note that this tradi-
tion has been carried out in much 
the same way, slightly varying 
with the experience and person-
alities of different hosts.

For Fallon, whose program rates 

highest among 18-49 year olds, his 
focus is endearingly rooted in a 
genuine desire to have fun and 
entertain audiences. Aided by a 

Grammy-winning band, the tal-
ented announcer and writer Steve 
Higgins and a long list of celebrity 
guests, Fallon exudes a youthful 
charm while embracing the show’s 
heritage. While this legacy pre-
dates the onset of my mother’s and 
my fascination with the show, its 
imminence can be felt in each epi-
sode. The feeling of being a part of 
something encompassing years of 
tradition and culture, something 
that began before my family’s 
arrival to the U.S., and has contin-
ued since, connects my mom and 
I not only to one another, but to a 
culture not fundamentally a part of 
our identities.

Though my mom and I grew up 

in two completely different worlds 
(she was born and raised in Israel, 
while I was raised in the U.S.), 
watching Fallon poke fun at presi-
dential candidates and hilariously 
execute uncanny impersonations 
of celebrities bridges the cultural 
gap between us. As much as grow-
ing up with two cultures indepen-
dent of one another was a gift, it 
also created a disparateness that 
I’ve had to work my whole life to 
reconcile. Part of this disparity was 
fostered by my mom’s dissociation 
from many aspects of American 
culture I had to learn on my own.

Almost 20 years later, however, 

the gap has grown smaller — in 
part due to the expanse of media 
that imbues American audiences 
with the nuances of its culture. 
For today’s young adults, who 
spend most of their time in front 
of screens, it’s rare to find a form 
of entertainment that grabs their 
attention while also appealing to 
their parents’ traditional sense 
of humor. Though late night TV 
has reached younger audiences, it 
has failed to represent and engage 
more diverse audience members — 
who are alienated by the predomi-
nance of white men hosting late 
night shows. 

Despite issues of diversity, late 

night TV’s longevity contributes to 
a shared culture among audiences 
— something Fallon embodies. In a 
2013 interview with GQ magazine, 
Fallon says of “Late Night” (the 
show that groomed him to take 
on his most recent hosting gig): 
“On ‘Late Night,’ it’s like we’re all 
in on the joke.” This attitude, car-
ried on to “The Tonight Show,” has 
generated a similar feeling among 
audience members. And for an 
hour each night, this feeling tem-
porarily relieves the discrepancy 
between the preferences and atti-
tudes bred by the cultural and gen-
erational differences between my 
mom and me.

The cost of death on 
‘The Walking Dead’

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

*Spoiler 
Alert: 
This 
article 

contains spoilers for “The Walk-
ing Dead,” “24” and “Game of 
Thrones.”*

Oct. 25, 2015

Glenn (Steve Yeun, “The Leg-

end of Korra”) stands on top of a 
dumpster as a hoard of zombies 
surround him and his terrified 
companion 
Nicholas 
(Michael 

Traynor, “Rectify”). Glenn grabs 
the man and tries to calm him 
down. The two look at each other; 
Nicholas whispers, “Thank you,” 
raises his gun and shoots himself. 
His flailing body falls into the sea 
of walkers, taking Glenn with him. 
Glenn lands on the ground and the 
monsters converge, ripping and 
tearing at flesh. Dramatic music 
crescendos while the diegetic 
audio fades out. Glenn cries out, 
covered in blood as the camera 
pulls away.

Fans of “The Walking Dead” 

were shocked to see the charac-
ter go. Glenn, introduced in the 
first season of the AMC mega-
hit, had gone from a shy delivery 

boy into a seasoned warrior and 
loving husband to Maggie (Lau-
ren Cohan, “Chuck”), all while 
becoming a fan-favorite. Despite 
seeing the worst the world had to 
offer, Glenn still had hope when 
he spared Nicholas, even after the 
man tried to kill him. But it was all 
for naught, as Glenn was claimed 
by the bleakly brutal world of “The 
Walking Dead” and viewers con-
templated a series without one of 
their favorite characters.

From the series’ perspective, 

the death held even more weight. 
Not since Andrea’s death at the end 
of season three had a character 
introduced in the show’s inaugu-
ral season been killed off — a fact 
made even worse considering the 
playful callback Glenn made to his 
first encounter with Rick over the 
radio in the same episode. Glenn’s 
death was a monumental move for 
the show.

Or was it?
In a TV environment where 

death is rampant, many viewers 
abide by the mantra, “Not until I 
see the body,” to confirm a charac-
ter’s death, something “The Walk-
ing Dead” would have a hard time 
proving since Glenn was appar-
ently devoured. But further seeds 
of doubt were planted, includ-
ing photos of Yeun on set next to 
new characters and showrunner 
executive producer Scott Gimple’s 
(“Chase”) own vague statement. 
To say the least, some people were 
suspicious.

Nov. 22, 2015

After weeks of speculation, 

these suspicions were confirmed 
during the episode “Heads Up,” 
as Glenn slipped out from under-
neath Nicholas’s dead body and 
hid under the dumpster until the 
hoard of zombies left. In spite of 
seemingly impossible odds, Glenn 
was alive as he began his trek back 
to Alexandria.

However, among the initial 

sighs of relief were the groans of 
dissent. For some, “The Walking 
Dead” had cheated its own rules. 
Somehow, the ruthless reality of 
the show had skipped over Glenn 
and allowed him to survive, and 
some people couldn’t buy it.

However, 
“The 
Walking 

Dead” has had characters work 
their way out of impossible situ-
ations before. In season four, 
Tyreese (Chad Coleman, “The 
Wire”) fought his way out of 
a surrounding hoard of zom-
bies with nothing more than a 
hammer. Daryl (Norman Ree-
dus, “The Boondock Saints”) 
did much the same with some 
embalming tools. Was Glenn’s 
sneaky survival just the straw 
that broke the camel’s back for 
suspension of disbelief?

Perhaps a tired audience is 

the answer, but “The Walking 
Dead” committed a bigger crime 
than just having a character 
emerge from imminent death; 
it has done that before and will 
do it again. The bigger infraction 
was its attempt to trick the audi-
ence and its subsequent emo-
tional manipulation.

Glenn went through a death 

scene in all intents and purposes. 
That’s how “The Walking Dead” 
presented it; from Glenn in 
anguish to the sorrowful music, 
it was a scene meant to gauge a 
specific emotional response from 
an invested audience. However, 

one vital element was missing 
— Glenn didn’t die. Instead, the 
show drew out his fate for four 
weeks as characters mourned 
his potential death. One particu-
lar scene had Maggie tell fellow 
survivor Aaron (Ross Marquand, 
“Impress Me”) about her preg-
nancy with Glenn’s child and her 
husband’s death: “I don’t get to 
know what will happen. I don’t 
get to know why it happened.” 
It’s an effective scene, but it’s 
built on weak foundations that 
amount to a fake out.

Glenn’s resurrection wasn’t 

a reconsideration, like the sev-
enth season return of Tony 
Almeida on “24” after his fifth 
season “death,” or ambiguous 
departure (predicated by source 
material, like the Hound’s fate 
in “Game of Thrones”). The 
move was a calculated decep-
tion meant to achieve all the 
emotional storytelling from a 
character’s death but with none 
of the consequences. From the 
“death scene” to episodes of 
subsequent remembrance, Scott 
Gimple and his writers ran the 
gamut of grief. But, at the end 
of the day “The Walking Dead” 
still has Glenn and now many of 
those pivotal scenes ring hollow.

Going Forward

Following 
Glenn’s 
“death,” 

Mary McNamara of the Los 
Angeles Times wrote, “On ‘The 
Walking Dead,’ however, death 
is part of the immersive experi-
ence. The writers make regular 
sacrifices of beloved characters, 
in part to keep its monsters scary 
but also to stay true to its con-
ceit: Just as our ancestors were, 
and people around the world are, 
continually struck down by natu-
ral predators, invading armies, 
oppressive 
governments 
and 

disease so are those living in the 
world of ‘The Walking Dead.’ ”

“The Walking Dead” can’t be 

afraid to kill off longtime favor-
ites or it risks betraying the 
inherent nature that made it so 
popular in the first place. A cast 
of core characters is needed for 
consistent investment and depth, 
but no one should be invincible.

“The Walking Dead” pres-

ents a brutally honest universe, 
where a character can die at any 
moment; it does a disservice to 
itself when it is not truthful with 
its audience.

Such is the case with Glenn’s 

near death and survival, a story-
telling maneuver that pulled the 
wool over many viewers’ eyes 
in hopes of delivering unearned 
emotional payoff.

And so, the series enters 

another critical juncture as it 
moves forward. Will this kind 
of storytelling become com-
mon as the main cast survives 
and a sea of redshirts falls to 
the encroaching zombies? Time 
will tell. Perhaps “The Walking 
Dead” has a harsh surprise in 
store for its characters and audi-
ence, especially considering the 
upcoming introduction of Jef-
frey Dean Morgan as the infa-
mous comic character, Negan, a 
violent man with a penchant for 
swinging a baseball bat named 
“Lucille.”

But for now, “The Walking 

Dead” has to live with the choice 
it has made. Yes, the show still 
has Glenn, but at what cost?

Colbert’s ‘Late 
Show’ better live

A trip to see a taping 

on the day before 

Thanksgiving

By ALEX INTNER

Daily Arts Writer

On 
the 
day 
before 

Thanksgiving, New York City’s 
Ed Sullivan Theater was decked 
out 
in 
special 
decorations, 

complete 
with 
a 
fireplace 

projection on the back screen 
and fall-colored lights around 
the studio. After a few hours 
of waiting, I was finally seated 
for the day’s taping of “The Late 
Show with Stephen Colbert.” 
The studio’s look told me it was 
going to be a special episode, 
and I was in for a fun hour-and-
a-half.

At television tapings, before 

the audience sees anyone who’s 
actually on screen, a comedian 
comes out to “warm up” the 
group. At “The Late Show,” 
Paul Mecurio got the spectators 
cheering 
and 
laughing. 
He 

achieves these two tasks in 
different 
ways: 
telling 
the 

crowd to yell and cheer (“I 
want you to be LOUD!”), and by 
making fun of individual studio 
viewers. I’ve seen Mecurio 
before tapings of “The Daily 
Show” (in fact, he accidentally 
referred to Colbert as “Jon” at 
one point), but at “Colbert” he 
actually brought those he made 
fun of onstage (instead of just 
pointing and talking to them).

In fact, he actually had my dad 

and me join him on the stage. (At 
one point, my dad’s laugh stuck 
out and got Mecurio’s attention.) 
He didn’t get much time with us 
(the stage manager was telling 
him to wrap up his set), but there 
was still enough for an audience 
member to shout “Go Blue” at 
our Michigan gear and for some 
members to cheer for our native 
New Jersey. It was a surreal 
couple minutes, which went by 
too fast.

One of my favorite aspects 

was the show’s band, Stay 
Human. Before Colbert went 
out on stage, the band played a 
seven-minute set. During that 
performance, they energetically 
presented a drum piece, with 
each of the members getting 
their own. Then, Batiste got the 
chance to shine, as he led the 
band through a few different 
songs. He ran around the stage 
and brought the audience in 
with enthusiasm. During the 
“commercial breaks” (yes, they 
take breaks during the taping), 
they played music from classic 
up-tempo jazz to some slow 
Blues, showing off a tremendous 
range. 
Even 
as 
stoppages 

extended for several minutes, 
Batiste and Stay Human made 
them feel like nothing.

Still, seeing Colbert was 

the reason I was there, and 
we got to see some more of his 
personality at the taping than 
viewers do at home. In a mid-
show Q&A, an audience member 
asked him about Tolkien’s “The 
Silmarillion.” While Colbert is 
known to be a huge “Lord of the 
Rings” fan, it surprised me to 
hear the specific details that he 
shared on the topic. Most late-
night hosts do Q&A’s like this, 
which gives the host a way to 

bond with the group — Colbert 
relishes this opportunity.

The crowd in the studio 

also saw Colbert make some 
mistakes during the taping. At 
one point during the episode, 
he told a joke about a monkey 
being Ronald Reagan’s first 
wife, and he laughed a bit too 
much after telling it. So, he 
had to repeat the joke a couple 
times, remarking, “Do try to 
enjoy that joke a second time. I 
find comedy works better when 
you 
know 
what’s 
coming.” 

There was also a moment where 
the spectators cheered for a 
character’s name, ruining a 
planned bit. Colbert cut the 
filming and told the group they 
missed their cue, which made 
the moment even better when it 
happened.

The Thanksgiving episode 

ended 
with 
Colbert, 
Stay 

Human and the episode’s guests 
around a dinner table, eating a 
feast cooked by Daniel Boulud. 
When giving the toast, he 
seemed grateful to be hosting 
“The Late Show.” He makes 
that feeling abundantly clear to 
those in the studio by projecting 
it into every segment, which 
makes the several hours of 
waiting worth it.

‘M’ opens Big Ten play

By MINH DOAN

Daily Sports Editor

A season ago, the Michigan 

hockey team played Wisconsin 
five times — four times in the 
regular season 
and 
once 
in 

the 
Big 
Ten 

Tournament.

The 

Wolverines 
triumphed over 
the Badgers in 
all five games, 
with an average 
margin 
of 

victory of 3.8 
goals.

But a fresh 

season 
and 

a 
new 
crop 

of 
freshmen 

breathed 
new 

life into Wisconsin coach Mike 
Eaves’ team. His squad will be 
ready to break the losing streak 
when No. 12 Michigan takes on 
the Badgers at Yost Ice Arena this 
weekend in both teams’ Big Ten 
opener.

“I know that they’re coming 

out 
hard,” 
said 
freshman 

forward Cooper Marody. “It adds 
something to be the first Big Ten 
game, and it’s going to be tougher, 
and there’s more at stake. We’ve 
got to come out hot, have a good 
start and do what we do well.”

Most notably, forward Luke 

Kunin 
and 
goaltender 
Matt 

Jurusik have given Badgers’ fans 
the hope that last season, when 
Wisconsin won just four games, 
will not repeat itself.

Kunin, 
who 
played 
on 

the 
United 
States 
National 

Development 
Team 
alongside 

many Wolverines, is currently 
second on the Badgers’ stat sheet 
with nine points and will look to 
get the Badgers on the board early.

Jurusik, on the other hand, 

didn’t come in as highly touted, and 
wasn’t expected to play much this 

season. But in the third game of 
the season at No. 1 Boston College, 
Jurusik replaced goaltender Adam 
Miller after Miller allowed two 
goals in four minutes.

Jurusik hasn’t looked back, 

playing every minute since the 
change in net in Chestnut Hill, 
Mass.

And since that game, the 

Badgers have steadily improved. 
Since starting out the season 
without a win in six games, the 
Badgers have gone 3-1-2 and come 
to Ann Arbor with an impressive 
win at then-No. 1 North Dakota 
and a tie against No. 9 Denver.

“They’re much better than their 

record,” said Michigan coach Red 
Berenson. “They’re much closer 
to a typical Wisconsin team. They 
play hard, they play physical, and 
they play with intensity. They’re 
hard to play against, they play 
good systems and they’ll be stingy 
defensively.”

Added 
freshman 
forward 

Cooper 
Marody: 
“We 
know 

they’re going to be a good team, 
and they have the ability to make 

plays so we have to play well.”

On the other side of the ice, 

Michigan comes into the Big Ten 
opener after an uneven weekend 
against Dartmouth that saw it 
score a 7-0 victory on Friday 
before tying the same Big Green 
team, 1-1, on Saturday.

“In hockey, the teams are 

pretty even no matter what,” 
Marody said. “At the level that 
we’re at, any team can beat any 
team on any night, and the puck 
just wasn’t finding the back of the 
net like it was in the first game. 
Sometimes that happens, so we 
need to find other ways to score.”

But Marody pointed out one big 

positive from the weekend, which 
was that the Wolverines allowed 
only one goal in two games.

A big part of that was senior 

goaltender Steve Racine, who 
finished 
the 
weekend 
with 

38 saves. But 14 minutes into 
Saturday’s game, Racine suffered 
a lower-body injury and junior 
goaltender Zach Nagelvoort came 
off the bench to take his place.

Nagelvoort 
played 
well, 

finishing the game with 30 saves, 
and he will be relied on again this 
week with Racine still injured.

But if the Michigan’s power 

play clicks as it has recently, 
Nagelvoort may not be called 
upon as often.

The man-up unit has scored 

nine goals in its last five games 
and will be one of the Wolverines’ 
keys to success this weekend.

“We’ve established a little 

rhythm as to where each player is 
going to be,” Marody said. “(The 
power play) flows better now.”

With the Big Ten teams not 

performing as well in the non-
conference portion schedule as 
many hoped, just a couple losses 
could be devastating for their 
NCAA Tournament hopes.

Michigan’s goal is to avoid that.
“(This weekend’s games) are 

just part of the puzzle,” Berenson 
said. “This whole RPI thing is 
a puzzle. All we can do is win as 
many games as we can, regardless 
of what other teams have done and 
regardless of the nonconference 
schedule.”

VOLLEYBALL
Wolverines return 
to NCAA tourney

By LANEY BYLER

For the Daily

As the Michigan volleyball 

team gears up for the first round 
of the NCAA Tournament against 
Santa Clara on 
Friday in Los 
Angeles, one 
characteristic 
that seems to 
be 
propelling 

the Wolverines 
is their ability 
to 
make 
a 

comeback.

Whether 

it’s making up 
for a lost point 
or a full set, 
Michigan has 
proven that it 
can rally. This can be credited 
to the Wolverines “point-for-
point” mentality. It’s a common 
theme that’s touched on during 
interviews and is clearly evident 
on the court.

“Even if you don’t lose the first 

match, you lose points throughout 
the match — you lose momentum 
at times,” said Michigan coach 
Mark Rosen. “You have to really 
bounce back from that. We use 
the term ‘playing point for point’, 
which means we have to play for 
the next point instead of playing 
for the last point, or 10 points ago. 
They’re thinking about the point 
they’re in. Whether you lose the 
first set or you lose two and have 
to come back and get them in five, 
this team has a lot of resilience 
that way.”

Michigan returns to the NCAA 

Tournament after missing the 
event last season. If it beats Santa 
Clara on Friday, it will play the 
winner of UCLA and Lipscomb 
on Saturday.

The 
Wolverines 
are 
no 

stranger to tough competition. 

Michigan has established its 
reputation as a comeback team in 
its recent conference wins against 
Penn State, Michigan State, Ohio 
State and Illinois. The first time 
the Wolverines encountered each 
of these teams, they suffered 
difficult defeats, such as their 
3-0 losses to Michigan State and 
Illinois. But the second time the 
Wolverines faced their Big Ten 
foes, they looked completely 
different. Michigan has stepped 
up its game each time it got a 
second chance against these 
teams, pulling wins against each 
higher-ranked squad.

Michigan hasn’t played Santa 

Clara before, so it can’t rely on 
its 
penchant 
for 
comebacks. 

However, the Wolverines do plan 
on playing Santa Clara as if they 
had lost to the Broncos before.

“We’re seeing these teams for 

the first time, but I think we’ll go 
in there with the same mentality 
that we do when we lose,” said 
senior setter Carly Warner. “So as 
long as we go in knowing we can 
beat them the first time and come 
out strong, we’ll be OK.”

Though 
the 
Wolverines 

won’t be able to capitalize on 
the weaknesses made apparent 
from playing a team multiple 
times, Michigan plans on taking 
advantage 
of 
the 
Broncos’ 

shortcomings early.

“I think that unfamiliarity is 

kind of a cool thing,” Rosen said. 
“It makes you go, ‘Hey, we really 
have to pay attention to this team 
a little bit more,’ and I think it’s 
exciting to play someone outside of 
the Big Ten. You’re guaranteed the 
first two rounds of the tournament 
to play someone different than 
a Big Ten team. So preparation-
wise, that’s the only difference. 
You have to realize you’re not 
playing someone you know as 
intimately as a Big Ten team.”

WRESTLING
Familiar event 
up next for ‘M’

Wolverines travel 

to tournament 
named after 
former coach

By LELAND MITCHINSON

Daily Sports Writer

When the Michigan wrestling 

team travels to Las Vegas for the 
34th annual Cliff Keen Collegiate 
Wrestling 
Invitational, 
it 

will 
find 
no 

shortage 
of 

links back to 
Ann Arbor.

The 

Wolverines 
have 
joined 

top teams from 
around 
the 

country in Las 
Vegas 
since 

December 
1983, 
when 

head coach Joe McFarland was a 
junior on the team.

“It 
was 
real 
competitive 

when we (started) coming to the 
tournament,” McFarland said. 
“There were a lot of really good 
teams like there are today. I lost 
in the finals my junior year, and I 
wrestled a really good match my 
senior year and won it. Obviously 
you always have better memories 
when you win, right?”

The invitational, named after 

legendary 
Wolverines 
coach 

Cliff Keen, was started by former 
Michigan wrestler and three-
time NCAA champion Mark 
Churella Sr. while he was serving 
as the head wrestling coach at 
UNLV.

Churella’s 
son 
Josh, 
a 

three-time 
All-American 
for 

the Wolverines, is currently 
an 
assistant 
coach 
for 
the 

Wolverines and is headed back 
to the tournament he spent his 
childhood attending, while his 
brothers Mark and Ryan, also 
former Michigan wrestlers, will 

be helping Churella Sr. run the 
event.

“It’s a neat deal for me now,” 

Churella said. “I grew up going 
to the tournament, and then I 
competed at the tournament, 
and now I’m able to coach at the 
tournament. It’s a pretty cool 
dynamic.”

For 
the 
wrestlers, 
the 

tournament provides an early-
season measuring stick against a 
high level of competition that the 
Wolverines may not see again 
until the NCAA Tournament.

Most of the Michigan starting 

lineup will be competing in the 
tournament, including returning 
All-Americans 
Rossi 
Bruno, 

a senior, and Conor Youtsey, 
a redshirt junior. Bruno and 
sophomore Alec Pantaleo will 
be looking to improve on their 
runner-up performances from 
last year’s tournament. However, 
the Wolverines will be without 
juniors 
Brian 
Murphy 
and 

Adam Coon, who are out with 
unspecified injuries.

“Everybody in the Big Ten 

knows each other,” Bruno said. 
“They know how each other 
wrestles. At this tournament, 
you draw from a wide variety of 
different styles of wrestling from 
all parts of the country, and you 
might run into somebody that 
you have no clue who it is. For 
me, that’s a big positive.”

Added 
McFarland: 
“There 

are a lot of quality kids here, kids 
who are highly ranked from 
across the country, so it’s going 
to be a challenge for our guys. 
For the most part, this is our first 
opportunity this year to compete 
in a big-time tournament like this 
against some of the top-ranked 
teams 
and 
nationally 
ranked 

individuals. We want our guys to 
see where we’re at this point in the 
season and then build from there.”

Despite flying to the West 

Coast 
and 
facing 
diverse 

competition, the Wolverines 
will 
find 
maize 
and 
blue 

connections everywhere.

Sophomore guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman played 25 minutes Tuesday at North Carolina State and may continue to do so with Derrick Walton Jr. injured.
Abdur-Rahkman’s role expands

By LEV FACHER

Managing Editor

Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-

Rahkman has spent the first month 
of the 2015-16 season competing for 
minutes. There’s not much time to 
go around in the backcourt for the 
Michigan men’s basketball team, 
but John Beilein’s clarification 
Monday 
that 
Abdur-Rahkman 

would remain a regular part of 
the Wolverines’ rotation made his 
plans for the future clearer.

The statement rang true a 

day later, but not in the way the 
Wolverines’ coach intended.

Abdur-Rahkman, a shooting 

guard, became a de facto point 
guard on Tuesday at North 
Carolina State when junior guard 
Derrick Walton Jr. suffered a 
sprained ankle midway through 
the first half.

“It was certainly a hellfire day, 

because Derrick’s been playing so 
well,” Beilein said.

Walton entered the Wolverines’ 

66-59 win averaging 10.4 points 
and 3.8 assists, and his confidence 

on the court was noticeable in 
the Wolverines’ wins against 
Charlotte and Texas last week.

With senior Spike Albrecht 

continuing 
his 
slower-than-

expected rehabilitation process 
following 
two 
offseason 
hip 

surgeries, Beilein had few options. 
Albrecht did see the court, but he 
was clearly limited in his abilities, 
picking up a personal foul on a 
loose ball and recording no shot 
attempts in five 
minutes played.

Even 
junior 

guard Andrew 
Dakich, 
who 
played 

substantial 
minutes toward 
the end of the 
2014-15 season as Michigan’s 
backcourt suffered one injury after 
another, was unavailable. Dakich, 
a walk-on, is planning on spending 
the 2015-16 season as a redshirt to 
preserve another year of eligibility.

Abdur-Rahkman’s 25 minutes 

were a season high — he played 
just 
six 
in 
the 
Wolverines’ 

previous game, a 78-72 defeat of 
Texas on Nov. 27.

Abdur-Rahkman and senior 

Caris LeVert, who are both 
typically 
considered 
shooting 

guards, ended up splitting the 
lion’s share of ball-handling duties. 
Abdur-Rahkman didn’t turn the 
ball over and served as a perimeter 
distraction for the North Carolina 
State defense. LeVert scored 18 
points on the night, and redshirt 

sophomore 
guard Duncan 
Robinson 
added 17.

With 

Walton 
out, 

somebody still 
had to defend 
the Wolfpack’s 

Anthony 
“Cat” 
Barber, 
and 

Abdur-Rahkman drew the short 
end of the stick.

“Muhammad-Ali 
did 
a 

wonderful job with just staying 
with Barber and keeping him 
from getting the ball in the places 
he likes it,” Beilein said.

Barber, who is averaging 20.3 

points per game this season, 
finished with 16. He dealt with 
second-half foul trouble, and 
his efforts proved too little to 
complete a late comeback attempt.

Abdur-Rahkman was quiet in 

terms of scoring, recording just 
four points on 2-for-4 shooting 
from the field, but slowing Barber 
and providing another capable 
ball-handling presence in the 
backcourt proved to be his biggest 
contributions.

As 
injuries 
go, 
Walton’s 

is well-timed. The toughest 
portion of the Wolverines’ non-
conference schedule is behind 
them, and Michigan has just one 
road game — Tuesday’s visit to 
Southern Methodist — between 
now and its Big Ten opener at 
Illinois on Dec. 30.

Beilein, however, doesn’t see 

things in that light.

“You’re not going to hear that 

from me,” he told WTKA radio’s 
Matt Shepard, who suggested that 
Michigan would have no trouble 
without Walton in its game at 
SMU.

“It was certainly 

a hellfire day.”

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
‘M’ earns 7-0 start

Wolverines roll past 

Pittsburgh to tie 

best season start in 

program history

By BRAD WHIPPLE

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball 
team’s 
undefeated 

start to the season hadn’t carried 
much 
weight 
headed into 
Thursday’s 
game. 
The 
Wolverines 
had 

outscored each of their six 
opponents by an average of 34 
points, running the floor on both 
offense and defense. Every game 
was decided by halftime.

Michigan needed to take on a 

more challenging test. It needed 
to face a better-known opponent, 
maybe even one with which the 
Wolverines had a history. What 
they got was Pittsburgh, which 
handed Michigan its first loss 
last season.

This 
time 
around, 
the 

Wolverines (7-0) passed.

Behind an explosive first half 

characterized 
by 
Michigan’s 

effective 
three-quarter-court 

press and 61-percent shooting, 
the Wolverines jumped out to 
a 22-point lead at halftime, and 
they never relinquished it in 
their 82-45 victory.

“We knew that (Pittsburgh) 

was gonna be scrappy, gonna play 
hard, gonna give us a different 
look than we’ve faced all year 
with their size, length and 
athleticism,” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico. “I thought we 
handled it exceptionally well 
from the start.”

Added senior guard Madison 

Ristovski: “We’re able to sub in 
and have fresh legs coming in all 
the time. That’s super important 
playing teams like Pittsburgh. 
Pittsburgh is a good team, but 
we were nine deep.”

Michigan not only bested one 

of its demons from last season, 
but it also continued its perfect 
start to the season, reaching 
7-0 for the first time since 2011 
— equaling the best start in 
program history.

Though Katelynn Flaherty 

missed her first four shots, the 
sophomore guard still led the 
team with 24 points. With 1:46 
left in the first quarter, Flaherty 
jumped to tip a pass back toward 
Pittsburgh’s basket, and she 
took it down for an uncontested 
layup.

That basket was the second of 

a 16-3 run, which lasted nearly 
five 
minutes 
and 
extended 

Michigan’s lead from five to 
18. The Wolverines continued 
to make stops on defense by 
drawing several charges, diving 
for loose balls and double-
teaming the Panthers’ point 
guards the instant they crossed 
the half-court line — limiting 
Pittsburgh (4-3) to 40.4-percent 
shooting.

Michigan found even greater 

success on its offensive end. The 
Wolverines shot 51.5 percent 
from the field and yielded the 
best results from their 3-point 
shooters. 
Freshman 
guards 

Boogie Brozoski and Nicole 
Munger each knocked down 
three baskets from beyond the 
arc and proved why they are two 
of the deadliest shooters on the 
team aside from Flaherty and 
junior guard Siera Thompson.

With 7:49 left in the game, 

Brozoski, who totaled 13 points, 

drained her third trey to give 
Michigan a 32-point lead, its 
largest of the night at that point.

The offense showed how 

balanced it could be once again, 
with 10 players scoring and 
seven others lending an assist.

“We have Katelynn Flaherty, 

who’s one of the best shooters 
in the country, on our team, and 
we’re not running every play for 
her,” Barnes Arico said. “We’re 
trying to find the best look — 
not only Katelynn. … Katelynn 
herself is making extra passes 
and not feeling the pressure of ‘I 
have to score’ every time.”

Where the Wolverines seemed 

to be lacking, though, was 
their rebounding game. Both 
freshman center Hallie Thome 
and sophomore forward Jillian 
Dunston had an unusually poor 
showing, combining for just 
seven rebounds.

Stepping into the rebounding 

role was junior guard Danielle 
Williams, who grabbed a team-
high 10 boards as Michigan 
still outrebounded Pittsburgh, 
39-25. As usual, Williams wasn’t 
looked to as a scorer and instead 
dominated under the glass while 
playing scrappy.

“She does the dirty work 

for us,” Ristovski said. “When 
you’re out there, you always 
want to be out there with 
Danielle, because she’s always 
doing the little things to help the 
team get better.”

The 
next 
two 
Sundays, 

Michigan 
will 
face 
two 

more teams that handed it 
demoralizing losses last season: 
Princeton 
and 
UCLA. 
It’s 

“revenge week,” as the team 
is calling it, so the Wolverines 
can’t soak in Thursday’s victory 
for too long.

They still have two tests left.

Wolverines’ pressure 
‘D’ makes difference

By BRANDON CARNEY 

Daily Sports Writer

It’s not often that a player 

shoots 7-for-7 in the first half and 
the opposing coach goes into the 
locker room happy.

But even though Pittsburgh 

forward Yacine Diop did just 
that, Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico was pleased with the way 
the Wolverines defended her on 
Thursday.

Diop may have scored 15 points 

at the break, but Michigan’s 
suffocating three-quarter court 
press forced the Panther forward 
into committing five turnovers in 
that time. By the end of the night, 
the Wolverines had pressured 
Pittsburgh 
into 
making 
24 

turnovers, as defense powered 
Michigan to the 82-45 win.

Knowing Pittburgh’s height 

was going to be an issue, Barnes 
Arico set up a press scheme to 
prevent the Panthers’ post players 
from getting the ball early in 
possessions.

The 
Wolverines 
had 
two 

defenders on Pittburgh’s ball 
handlers in the backcourt, trying 
to force half-court traps in the 
corner or risky cross-court passes.

Senior 
guard 
Madison 

Ristovski was at the head of the 
press early in the contest. She 
was constantly sliding between 
the Panthers’ guards, trying to 
stop them from getting any open 
passing lanes or outside shots.

“(Ristovski) started the game 

focused and locked in,” Barnes 
Arico said. “She scored for us 
early. She defended for us early. 
She’s playing at another level, 
and we need her to because of her 
experience. I thought Madison 
was absolutely terrific for us 
tonight.”

Ristovski played a huge role 

setting up the defense in the 
first quarter, but it’s junior guard 
Siera Thompson who will haunt 
the memory of Pittsburgh ball 
handlers. 
Thompson 
picked 

up 
a 
team-high 
five 
steals 

and 
pressured 
the 
Panthers 

into making countless errors 
throughout the contest.

The Wolverine defense really 

got up to speed when freshman 
guards 
Boogie 
Brozoski 
and 

Nicole Munger entered the game 
after the under-five timeout in 
the first quarter. The Wolverines 
earned 11 steals in total and forced 
Pittsburgh to commit turnovers 
on 34 percent of its possessions.

But whenever the Panthers got 

through the Michigan backcourt, 
the Wolverines were ready to 
slide in and make an aggressive 
move in front of the basket. 
Michigan drew five charges, 
with sophomore forward Jillian 
Dunston acting as the roadblock 
between Pittsburgh players and 
the basket.

While Dunston has led the 

Wolverines in rebounding for 
most of the season, junior guard 
Danielle Williams worked her 
way inside and grabbed a team 
high 10 rebounds Thursday. The 
guard made up for her lack of 
height by outhustling and out-
jumping Pitt’s big lineup.

Williams has come off the 

bench to spark the Michigan 
defense throughout her career, 
and she did it again against the 
Panthers.

“Out of anyone, (Williams 

is) not a scorer,” Barnes Arico 
said. “But the charges that she 
took tonight, and the tips and 
deflections that she took, and 
to be a 5-(foot)-8 kid and get 10 
rebounds against a big team just 
shows you her toughness and her 
unselfishness.”

The 
Wolverines 
baffled 

Pittsburgh all night on the 
defensive end, and will hope 
whatever scheme they throw 
at Princeton on Sunday will be 
similarly effective. The Tigers’ 
offense, 
which 
averages 
79 

points per game, may finally be 
an even match for a Michigan 
defense 
that 
answered 
the 

challenge Thursday.
