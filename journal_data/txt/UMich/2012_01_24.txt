Campus
reacts to
visit from
president
Students express
excitement for speech
later this week
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily News Editor
Following yesterday's announcement
that President Barack Obama will be
speaking at the University this Friday,
campus leaders and students on both sides
of the aisle expressed excitement for the
upcoming visit from the nation's leader.
Though Obama is expected to discuss
college affordability in his speech, stu-
dents said they hope he also discusses
ongoing issues pertaining to job growth
and rebuilding the economy in Michigan -
topics particularly important to students
getting ready to enter the workforce.
Anton Dirnberger, chair of the Univer-
sity's chapter of College Republicans, said
though he disagrees with Obama's views
on several issues, he respects the "office of
the presidency."
"I think as a Wolverine, that's great to
have the President - no matter what party
he is a part of - come to campus," Dirn-
berger said.
However, Dirnberger expressed frus-
tration that Obama is attempting to garner
electoral support amid economic difficul-
ties that continue to afflict the nation, add-
ing that he anticipates that the president
will be more focused on campaigning in
his speech than discussing impactful pol-
icy.
"It's pretty much a campaign speech
- we all know that," Dirnberger said. "I
wish, and I think a lot of people do, that he
would spend more time trying to work out
some ideal situations to get some Ameri-
cans back to work."

20 years ago this week (J-

The Ann Arbor News
Detroit Free Press claimed

traveling to candidates' ho
to keep details of the hiring1

Act requires that the public 1.

be able to make some decisi

40 years ago this week (Janu-
ary 26, 1972): In a historic case, a
University research associate had
her final court appeal in charges
regarding sex discrimination and
unfair wages.
Cheryl Clark was the first
woman in the country to request
increased wages from a university
on the basis of gender discrimina-
tion. Her initial complaint to the
University stated that her male
coworker, who held thesame posi-
tion, made $3,400 more than her.
She also argued that her salary
should be higher than his, as she
claimed to have more seniority,
training and experience.

The University originally
denied her request and stated any
discrimination was not intended
and therefore did not merit legal
action.
70 years ago this week (Janu-
ary 27, 1942): After winter break,
95 University students were
infected with a highly contagious
form of German measles.
At the time, hospital officials
said they witnessed an increas-
ing number of cases every day fol-
lowing the initial outbreak. The
contagion ward reported to the
Daily that it was able to handle the
increased patient load, but said it
was unsure if that would remain
true if the disease was not con-
tained.

COLEMAN
From Page 1
Coleman said the University
has "an academic environment
that is almostunparalleled," add-
ing that its focus on global oppor-
tunities and its vast involvement
in the arts are particular areas
where the University hopes to
demonstrate its excellence.
"The great strength of the
University is in the breadth of its
scholarly endeavors," Coleman
said. "... We are trying to engage
students in as many ways as we
can."

Coleman continued, discuss-
ing the necessity of providing
accessible and affordable educa-
tion for University students.
"We have to find ways to offer
higher education at a cost that is
sustainable," she said.
However, she said many states,
including Michigan, are disin-
vesting in higher education, not-
ing that the state has continued
to decrease allocations to higher
education funding over the past
few years - including a 15-percent
cut to higher education funding
enacted by Republican Gov. Rick
Snyder in the last fiscal year.
"The state has a role, and we
need to be articulating that role,"
she said.

-H-(I

While Coleman said the Uni-
versity understands that the
state can't provide funding at
the levels it has previously sus-
tained, she said she hopes the
gap in funding can be alleviated
by donations from businesses.
"To be successful in this
endeavor we need strong sup-
port and advocacy from the busi-
ness community," she said. "I
am pleased that we have a group
of business owners ... that are
advocating for a reinvestment in
higher education."
Outside of business and state
support, Coleman also noted the
need for private support for the
University.
"Private support is no longer a
luxury - it is a necessity," she
said.
Coleman said the University
is tightening its budget, focus-
ing on what she called "cost
containment." She said the
University has saved $400 mil-
lion in budget cuts since 2003,
and plans to save an additional
$90 million in further budget
cuts this year.
"We have to find smarter
ways to do things," she said.
She said the funds saved
from the cuts have been allo-
cated toward need-based
student financial aid and the
hiring more staff, ultimately
leading to the hiring of more
than 150 new faculty members.
There was a double-digit
increase in demand for under-
graduate need-based financial
aid in six of the last seven years,
according to Hanlon. Hanlon
said he is glad that the Univer-
sity had the money to invest in
those areas.
"I'm glad that we were able
to find the funding to do it," he
said. "I think (it) had (a) tre-
mendous benefit."

Republicans sieze
opportunity to gain
Congressional seat
PHOENIX (AP) - U.S. Rep.
Gabrielle Giffords' decision to
resign from Congress sets up a
political free-for-all in her com-
petitive southeastern Arizona
district, with voters set to pick
a temporary replacement and
then a full-term representative in
rapid succession.
As Giffords, critically injured
in a mass shooting last year, steps
out of the public eye this week
to focus on rehabilitation and
recovery efforts, her departure
thrusts Tucson into the national
spotlight.
The three-term Democrat was
heavily favored to be re-elected,
so her decision to step down cre-
ates an opportunity for Repub-
licans to pick up a seat in the
House.
But holding onto Giffords' seat
has sentimental as well as sym-
bolic value for Democrats as the
elections will come as the presi-
dential race intensifies - in a Red
state that the Obama campaign is
targeting.
Bruce Ash, Republican nation-
al committeeman for Arizona,
said the upcoming special elec-

tion "will be a bellwether prob-
ably for the November elections."
Giffords was shot in the head
as she met with constituents out-
side a Tucson supermarket on
Jan. 8, 2011. Six people died and
13 were wounded, including Gif-
fords. She has made steady prog-
ress in her recovery, returning
to the House chamber in August
to cast a vote for the debt-ceiling
compromise, but she still has dif-
ficulty speaking.
With both parties expected to
target the race, "it means money.
It means lots of national money,"
said Carolyn Warner, Democratic
national committeewoman.
Under a timetable set in Ari-
zona law, Republican Gov. Jan
Brewer will schedule the special
elections - both a primary and
a general - once Giffords leaves
office and a vacancy is declared.
The primary is expected to be
held in April and the general in
June.
But only months later, there
will be the regular primary elec-
tion in August to pick nominees
for the Nov. 6 election for the full
two-year term that starts next
January.
"We have no idea how this is
going to go," said state Rep. Steve
Farley, a Democrat who said he
had his sights on running for a
state Senate seat but now is leav-

ing open the possibility of a con-
gressional race. "The dynamics
are going to be very hard to pre-
dict."
In another twist, the district
itself changes between the two
elections, shedding some outly- *
ing areas of Tucson and including
more of the central city.
The special election is for the
8th Congressional District. The
regular election is for the 2nd
District, recently renumbered
and reconfigured under the once-
a-decade redistricting.
"It's goingto complicate things
for people who are running in
that they have to run in both
districts," said Jim Kolbe, the
Republican who held the con-
gressional seat before Giffords.
Both versions of the district
are regarded as competitive, but
Democrats pick up a few percent-
age points in voter registration
under the newer version to pull
roughly even with Republican.
Independents make nearly a third
of the electorate.
Voter turnout typically is low
in special elections, but the extra
attention devoted to this cam-
paign could spur participation,
particularly among Democrats,
who tend to vote at lower rates
than Republicans, said Patrick
Kenney, an Arizona State Univer-
sity political science professor.

Four of six Kenyan

International Criminal Court
judges yesterday ordered four
prominent Kenyans, including
two potential presidential candi-

orchestrating a deadly wave of
violence after their country's dis-
puted 2007 presidential election.
Among the four suspects sent

Kenyatta, and former Education
Minister William Ruto - both of
whom are planning to run for the
presidency this year.
Kenyatta, 50, is the son of
Kenya's founding president, Jomo
Kenyatta, and the country's rich-
est citizen with a personal for-
tune of half a billion dollars. Ruto
is a former ally of Prime Minister
Raila Odinga, but the two had a
falling-out - partly over Ruto's
insistence on making his own
presidential bid this year.

A bill making it a crime to deny

The Senate's vote yesterday

impose new sanctions on France.
It already suspended military,

the lower house of French parlia-
ment passed the bill last month.
The measure now needs to be
signed by President Nicolas Sar-
kozy, whose party proposed it, to
become a law.
While most historians contend
that the 1915 killings of Arme-
nians as the Ottoman Empire
broke up was the 20th century's
first genocide, Turkey vigorously
denies that.

MATT ROURKE/AP
Republican presidential candidate, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich meets with supporters at The River Church,
yesterday, in Tampa, Fla.
Gingrich in firing ine as
campaig moves to Florida'

Romney accuses
him of engaging
in "potentially
wrongful activity"
TAMPA, Fla. - Fresh off his
big South Carolina win, Repub-
lican Newt Gingrich found him-
self on the defensive yesterday
as the volatile GOP presidential
contest shifted to Florida.
Chief rival Mitt Romney
sharpened his attacks on the for-
mer House speaker, calling him
"erratic" and pressing for disclo-
sure ofclients, contracts, records
and other work he was paid to
do after leaving Congress. Atop
Romney's list are Gingrich's
consulting arrangements with
mortgage giant Freddie Mac and
details of ethics investigations in
the 1990s.
Romney also charged that
Gingrich had engaged in "poten-
tially wrongful activity" when
he worked with former col-
leagues in Congress to create
a prescription drug benefit for
Medicare.
"We could see an October sur-
prise a day from Newt Gingrich,"
Romney said after a round-table
session with people struggling
with home foreclosure prob-
lems.
Gingrich, who earlier had

appeared on ABC's "Good Morn-
ing America," mocked Romney
as "somebody who has released
none of his business records,
who has decided to make a stand
on transparency without being
transparent." After initially
balking, Romney is set to release
personal tax records today.
The sniping between the two
contenders opened a Florida
fight that is shaping up as piv-
otal to determining which one
of them will become the GOP's
presidential nominee. The four
candidates - Gingrich, Romney,
Rick Santorum and Ron Paul
- were to meet Monday night
in Tampa for the first of two
debates heading into Florida's
primary on Jan. 31.
Gingrich, who planned a pre-
debate campaign appearance on
yesterday afternoon in Tampa,
basked in his come-from-behind
triumph in South Carolina two
days earlier. The win made for
three different winners in the
first three states to hold con-
tests, with Santorum winning
Iowa and Romney taking New
Hampshire.
Gingrich's campaign said it
had raked in $1 million in the
first 24 hours since South Caro-
lina's primary Saturday.
Frequently the aggressor in
the race, Gingrich is now the one
taking fire from all sides.
Santorum described Gin-

grich as too "high risk" to be the
Republican standard-bearer.
Romney has been calling Gin-
grich a lobbyist. Gingrich flatly
denied lobbying on behalf of
Freddie Mac or other clients.
"It's not true. He knows it's
not true. He's deliberately say-
ing things he knows are false,"
Gingrich said. "I just think that's
what the next week will be like."
Gingrich told ABC he has
campaign lawyers working to
make the Freddie Mac records
public. He said the decision
rests with the Center for Health
Transformation, which he
founded but no longer owns.
Two former Gingrich compa-
nies earned $1.6 million over
eight years from Freddie Mac.
Gingrich has said he only earned
about $35,000 a year himself.
Gingrich's work for Freddie
Mac has come under scrutiny
because of its role in the housing
meltdown.
After the housing forum
yesterday, Romney told report-
ers that Gingrich should con-
sider giving back any money he
earned from the troubled mort-
gage company.
Gingrich said he was braced
for more criticism from his
remaining opponents and their
allies. On Sunday, some Repub-
lican leaders voiced worry
about Gingrich's combative
style.

After oil embargo
Iranian officials
target Strait of
Hormuz
TEHRAN (AP) - Senior
Iranian lawmakers stepped up
threats yesterday that Islamic
Republic warships could block
the Persian Gulf's oil tanker
traffic after the latest blow by
Western leaders seeking to rein
in Tehran's nuclear program: A
punishing oil embargo by the
European Union that sharply
raises the economic stakes for
Iran's defiance.
The EU decision in Brus-
sels - following the U.S. lead to
target Iran's critical oil exports
- opened a new front against
Iran's leadership. Pressure is
bearing down on the clerical
regime from many directions,
including intense U.S. lobbying
to urge Asian powers to shun
Iranian crude, a nose-diving
national currency and a recent
slaying in what Iran calls a
clandestine campaign against
its nuclear establishment.
In response, Iranian officials
have turned to one of their most
powerful cards: The narrow
Strait of Hormuz at the mouth
of the Gulf and the route for
a fifth of the world's oil. Iran
has rattled world markets with
repeated warnings it could
block the hook-shaped water-
way, which could spark a con-
flict in the Gulf.
Military experts have ques-
tioned whether Iran has the
naval capabilities to attempt a
blockade. But the U.S. and allies
have already said they would
take swift action against any
Iranian moves to choke off the
30-mile (50-kilometer) wide
strait - where the American
aircraft carrier USS Abraham
Lincoln, along with British and
French warships, entered the
Gulf on Sunday without inci-
dent.
The British. Ministry of
Defense said the three nations
sought to "underline the
unwavering international com-
mitment to maintaining rights
of passage under international
law."
Earlier this month, Gen.
Martin Dempsey, chairman of
the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff,
told CBS' "Face the Nation"
that 'Iranian forces could block
shipping through the strait
"for a period of time," but
added "we can defeat that"

and restore the flow of oil and
other commerce. He did not
offer details on a U.S. military
response, but the Pentagon is
believed to have contingency
plans for such a scenario.
A member of Iran's influen-
tial national security commit-
tee in parliament, Mohammad
Ismail Kowsari, said yesterday
that the strait "would defi-
nitely be closed if the sale of
Iranian oil is violated in any
way." He went on warn the U.S.
against any "military adven-
turism."
Another senior lawmaker,
Heshmatollah Falahatpisheh,
said Iran has the right to shut-
ter Hormuz in retaliation for
oil sanctions and that the clo-
sure was increasingly probable,
according to the semiofficial
Mehr news agency.
"In case of threat, the closure
of the Strait of Hormuz is one
of Iran's rights," Falahatpisheh
said. "So far, Iran has not used
this privilege."
The lawmakers' comments
do not directlyreflect the views
of Iran's ruling clerics, but they
echo similar statements made
earlier this month by military
commanders with close ties to
the theocracy.
At the same time, however,
Iran has tried to ease tensions
by offering to reopen nuclear
talks with the U.S. and other
world powers after a one-year
gap, and backing off warnings
about U.S. naval operations
in the Gulf - where the U.S.
Navy 5th Fleet has a base in
Bahrain.
Yesterday in Brussels, the
EU's foreign policy chief Cath-
erine Ashton urged Iranto offer
"some concrete issues to talk
about."
"It is very important that it
is not just about words; a meet-
ing is not an excuse, a meeting
is an opportunity and I hope
that they will seize it," she said
as the EU adopted its tough-
est measures on Iran with an
immediate embargo on new oil
contracts and a freeze of the
country's Central Bank assets.
About 90 percent of the EU's
nearly $19 billion in Iranian
imports in 2010 were oil and
related products, according to
the International Energy Agen-
cy.
Yesterday, the U.S. added
new sanctions on Bank Tejer-
at, Iran's third-largest bank.
Obama has also approved new
sanctions on Iran's powerful
central bank that take effect
later this year.

Bosquez and Soto were taking
the children to a hotel in Gua-

Irish couples who believed they
were going to adopt them.
The plan began to unravel
on Jan. 9, when local police

ranza and accused her of trying
to sell her 2-year-old daughter.

Youth, assemble!
Anti-SOPA protests should begin activism trend
t's not easy to mobilize the youth, but the sweeping changes
proposed by the recent Stop Online Piracy Act and Protect IP
Act bills did just that last week. The bills received widespread
attention from the outset, owing to the broad regulations they would
impose on Internet users if passed. However, it wasn't until the legisla-
tion incited protests from Wikipedia, Google and other major websites
that students finally took note of the bills' implications. It's unfortu-
nate, however, that only threatening pirated online content rallied
young people. Youth activism and involvement must affect all aspects
of politics, and the Internet has proven its ability to sustain it.

PIPA was introduced in the U.S. Senate on
May 12 and SOPA was introduced in the U.S.
House on Oct. 26. Though the bills' propo-
nents claim that their passage is necessary
to protect content providers from copyright
infringement, many others see the potential
for undue damage. Congressmen, academ-
ics and analysts who oppose the bills often
cite their "domain-blocking" provisions as
the most damaging parts of the bills. Under
these provisions, the government could
block an entire domain name for copyright
infringement committed by a single user. In
other words, if a YouTube user uploaded a
copyrighted video to the site, SOPA and PIPA
would allow the government to block and fine
the entire YouTube domain for a single user's
actions.
Students were relatively quiet about the
legislation at first, but tensions reached a
fever pitch when Wikipedia initiated a SOPA/
PIPA "blackout" last Wednesday for 24 hours
to simulate the legislation's possible conse-
quences. Tweets mentioning SOPA spiked
sharply during the blackout - from 5,000
tweets per hour to an eventual peak at 267,000
tweets per hour in the early evening.
Though the sudden rush of support was
encouraging, it also revealed the younger
demographic's overall lack of motivation.

Nearly half of Twitter users are between ages
18 and 34. The legislation has been available
for review for months, so it stands to reason
that it shouldn't take a show of force like the
Wikipedia blackout to get students' attention.
The attention had serious implications.
Both bills are now on hold and appear to have
been stopped. While the topic is sure to be
broached again, hopefully the Internet outcry
will lead to industry input to find a reasonable
solution to piracy.
There's no doubt that content creators and
providers deserve some sort of legal protec-
tion against creative theft. Unfortunately,
SOPA and PIPA protect content providers at
the expense of domain holders and consum-
ers by holding the whole online community
responsible for the crimes of a few rogue web-
users.
Since young people represent a huge por-
tion of the web community, it's their respon-
sibility to take charge of and protect what's
important to them. The rec~nt controversy
made it clear that the influence of students
nation-wide is strong and resonant. But activ-
ism can't stop after this would-be victory. In
2008, students came out in record numbers to
make their vision of the country relevant in
electing President Barack Obama. Four years
later, the 2008 trend mustbe repeated.

When I first wrote about
the Keystone XL pipeline
last October, I assumed
it was a forgone
conclusion the
thing would be
built. All the
tree-hugger pro-
tests in the world ,
wouldn't be able '
to stop a project
that was pro- JOE
jected to import SUGIYAMA
700,000 barrels
of crude oil a day
to the United States. And I was right
- kind of.
It turns out environmental-
ists have a rather unlikely group to
thank for putting a halt to the pipe-
line - the GOP. That's right - the
Republican Party has unwittingly
thrown a wrench into Keystone XL's
progress with a clause attached to
a payroll tax cut bill, demanding a
60-day deadline for its review pro-
cess. That bill, passed last month,
gave President Barack Obama until
last week to approve or reject the
hot-button issue.
Much to the chagrin of Republi-
cans - who believed lighting a fire
under the proposal would yield a
rash decision to uphold the wishes of
jobless Americans - Obama reject-
ed the project. The State Depart-
ment cited the expedited timeline
as the main reason for the pipeline's
rejection. There wasn't enough
time to fully explore the environ-
mental impact of Keystone XL on
the regions in its path. Though the
decision was ultimately Obama's to
make, the State Department strongly
suggested he deny the permit.
Obama has said that Keystone
XL isn't dead in the water and his
administration was on pace to
approve it before Congress's inter-
ference. There might be hope for

an alternative pipeline in the future
- barring further Republican med-
dling with the approval process.
Russ K. Girling, chief execu-
tive of TransCanada, the Canadian
company attempting to build the
pipeline, has alreadygone on record
saying "TransCanada remains fully
committed to the construction of
Keystone XL," and that they "will
reapply for a presidential permit
and expect a new application to be
processed in an expedited manner,
to allow for an in-service date of
late 2014."
To borrow from College Game-
day's Lee Corso, not so fast my
friend. According to Kerri-Ann
Jones, assistant secretary of state for
oceans and international environ-
mental affairs, it's not that simple.
Expediting the process is currently
not an option, and a new proposal
would warrant an entirely new Final
Environmental Impact Statement,
in addition to the months needed
to process its findings. The Obama
Administration has said it will study
these new pipeline routes, but the
final decision on the permit will be
delayed until after the presidential
election in November.
As you can imagine, this was a
highly unpopular decision among
Republicans and oil companies alike.
The American Petroleum Institute
is in the process of launching a cam-
paign advocating for the pipeline.
The group notes that Keystone XL is
the "largest shovel-ready project in
America" - a fact that will surely be
hammered home during the upcom-
ing presidential election.
The GOP presidential candi-
dates are united under the front
that Obama has cost the country
with his rejection of the pipeline.
Mitt Romney has called Obama's
decision "as shocking as it is reveal-
ing," citing the president's "lack

of seriousness about bring down
unemployment, restoring economic
growth and achieving energy inde-
pendence." Rick Santorum claims
that Obama is "panderingto radical
environmentalists." And the ever
soft-spoken Newt Gingrich called
the rejection "a, stunningly stupid
thing to do."
The opinions of the GOP can-
didates have been well-received
among their Republican breth-
ren, but the fact remains that this
rejection is their own doing. With
ample time to evaluate the environ-
mental impacts of the pipeline and
offer alternative solutions to these
issues, Keystone XL could have
very well been the next big project
for the U.S.

Enviornmental
groups should
thank the GOP.

God knows waiting for our gov-
ernment to address an issue can be
like watching paint dry. That said,
a verdict that has the potential to
directly affect the health of millions
of Americans is not something that
should be decided on a whim. Repub-
licans dropped the ball on this one
(though you'd be hard-pressed to get
one to admit it) and they should be
the ones under fire for the rejection
of the pipeline. If they'd only let the
process play out, our country would
be in a position to create thousands
of jobs and import millions of gallons
of turmoil-free crude oil.

Waiting for King's dream

We, as citizens of the United States, have
the right to vote our highest officials into
office. Typically, we then proceed to complain.
about many of their decisions so much that
we would have ourselves believe we could
do a better job than those officials who have
made the science of politics their mind, body
and soul. This being said, our system works.
The United States boasts one of the world's
highest GDP per capita, and most of us would
say we are happy. But does that really make
us happy?
Unfortunately, the successes of our sys-
tem, whatever they may be, have falsely con-
vinced society that politicians should lead our
country - even when they have committed
adultery, we would consider electing them to
represent our country. To me, this is disgust-
ing and disgraceful.
I am not a conservative or a liberal. I think
my place is to give more than I receive and to
make all decisions based on morality. As some
politicians would see it, it is completely accept-
able to have one CEO who makes $5 million
a year pay fewer taxes than a worker making
$42,000. This is immoral and unacceptable.
To tax the CEO and redistribute the money to
the blue-collar worker: this too is immoral and
unacceptable. To invoke morals - something
our politicians should advocate - would be to
persuade the CEO that he should contribute
to the well-being of the worker. A moral politi-
cian would help the CEO see he does not need
to make $5 million a year whether he rightfully
earned it or not. This is where one fault of our
system lies.

Secondly, this lack of attention to morals is
due to a partisan political system. When vot-
ing, we are forced into choosing a side; these
two sides have stuck evermore to the ideals of
their parties. This is of benefit to no one. We
should not need liberalism, conservatism or
libertarianism.
Our politicians should be friends. They
should have the utmost desire to make those
who elected them happy, whether it is by their
own ideas or someone else's. Above all, they
should be role models for all of us, and they are
disgracefully not living up to this task.
Politicians should ensure that everyone has
an equal opportunity to succeed. This means
that mentally handicapped students in Ann
Arbor should receive as much attention and
money for their education as those in cities
throughout the country.
They should see to it that the legislation
this country was built upon are upheld. This
means that an attention-grabbing trial should
not come before the trial of someone charged
with a lesser crime. A speedy and fair process
applies to all trials equally.
The examples I have given are simple. They
are matters which can be dealt with much bet-
ter than they are currently, and it is up to our
politicians to make decisions based on moral
standards to change these things. In the words
of author W.E.B. Du Bois, "the vision of life that
rises before these dark eyes has in it nothing
mean or selfish." Maybe our politicians should
consider this before acting.

ast summer, I visited the
Clayborn Temple AME
Church
in Memphis,
Tenn. where
Martin Luther
King Jr. came
to rally striking
garbage workers .,..
at what would
be the end of his
life. The church JOEL
had been the BATTERMAN
workers' head-
quarters during
the strike, which began after two
of their number were accidentally
crushed to death inside a garbage
truck. The rest decided they'd had
enough ofbeingtreatedlike the trash
they handled. But the congregation
has left since then and the church
was closed - the walls overgrown
by crawling vegetation, windows
boarded up, the whole structure
encircled by a chain-link fence.
Next door, the parking garage of
the new downtown stadium turned
its concrete back on the house of
worship, flaunting a Toyota sign,
one of the big companies without
unionized workforces that helped
make the old Confederacy a new
center for auto production. Across
the street on the other side of the
church, empty lots baked in the sun
where buildings once stood. I ate
lunch on the grass outside with a
local NAACP official who remem-
bered King's visit and its tragic
conclusion. He said with regret
that despite the demise of legal Jim
Crow, things now aren't much bet-
ter for many people.
This past Sunday, I attended
the service at New Bethel Baptist
Church on Linwood Ave. in Detroit.

New Bethel was the church of the
Reverend C.L. Franklin, father of
Aretha Franklin, and one of the
greatest preachers of his genera-
tion. Today, New Bethel is still in its
old home, and the sermons remain
stunning. The church's history
room displays photos of Franklin
marching with King and other civil
rights leaders of the era. Outside,
the scene is just as forlorn as Mem-
phis, if not colder. Linwood's busi-
nesses were devastated by the 1967
riots - or rebellion, if you prefer.
In the decades since, the street has
decayed further until only the odd
party store and church remain to
break the monotony of emptiness
along its length.
Martin Luther King Jr. Day is rou-
tinized in present society. It can be
hard to imagine that simply declar-
ing the day a federal holiday took
decades of struggle. If we tune in at
all, we often get pious calls for ser-
vice: bloodless summons to the mak-
ing of ill-defined differences, shorn
of any relation to the deeper ques-
tions that animated King's career.
Even the University's MLK Sympo-
sium theme this year, describing a
"new generation of activism," tends
to wilt without specific attention to
what this activism should affect.
Making the day meaningful,
I would suggest, requires us to
engage not only in celebration, but
also in mourning, to recognize not
merely the triumphs but the trag-
edies the American freedom strug-
gle has experienced since King's
death. It demands we pay atten-
tion not just to podiums on glitter-
ing stages, but also to city streets
from Memphis to Detroit, where
the ghosts of the movement's past
hover uneasily over landscapes of

profound loss.
As Detroit-born historian Kevin
Boyle has observed, America is by
and large a Christian nation, and
King's story has all too easily and
conveniently been transfigured, as
it were necessary, into the familiar
story of Christ. King died for Ameri-
ca's sins, the story suggests, and with
his blood, the stains of racism could
be washed clean. All we now need
is to believe in his ideals, or a subtly
altered principle of "colorblindness",
to find our national salvation. Or so

01

Pay attention to
what activism
should affect.
some would have us think.
Instead of faith in freedom from
personal prejudice, I'd argue that
it is through activism that we can
most surely fulfill King's dream.
In contrast to the Christ anal-
ogy Boyle describes, this strategy
assumes knowledge of the broader
project of social reconstruction
King sought to accomplish, and the
ways in which we've fallen gravely
short of the mark. Among activ-
ists, a frequent warning against
negative campaigns notes that King
chose to give an "I Have A Dream"
speech, not an "I Have A Night-
mare" speech. That is correct. Yet,
we must also face the nightmares
that still haunt us before we can
resurrect the dream.

New Apple apps provide
students with e-textbooks

Despite growing
use of e-readers,
students still prefer
paper textbooks
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
For the Daily
With the recent launch of two
new iPad applications developed
for the use of electronic text-
books, Apple may help ease the
sore backs of students lugging
heavy books around campus.
Despite the increasing usage
of electronic devices for reading
nationwide, students, a Univer-
sity professor and a local book-
store employee say they don't
anticipate that the apps will lead
to a decline in the purchase of
paper textbooks in Ann Arbor.
Last Thursday, Apple released
iBook Author and iBooks 2.
The iBook Author app allows
authors and publishers to write
and design their own textbooks
at no cost. iBooks 2 improves
on its predecessor, iBooks 1, by
including the ability to highlight
and annotate text, tap on words
for definitions and make digital
flashcards from personal notes.
During the announcement of
the release of the apps last week,
Apple said that high-school
level textbooks would be priced
at $14.99 or less, while pricing
on college-level e-textbooks
remains undetermined.
Apple has already contracted

Dirnberger said though he
would be somewhat interested
in hearing Obama's views on
higher education, he would
rather hear him speak about his
decision to reject plans for the
Keystone XL oil pipeline - a
transnational project that would
install an oil pipeline stretching
from Canada to Texas.
"I know he definitely won't
be talking about that, but that's
what I would like to hear," Dirn-
berger said.
Dirnberger said he hopes
that Obama won't suggest rais-
ing taxes to make college more
affordable.
Though about 50 students
protested at House Major-
ity Leader Eric Cantor's (R-Va)
speech at the Michigan League
in October, Dirnberger said the
group does not plan to protest
against Obama's speech, adding
that he was particularly upset
with the protests staged during
Cantor's speech.
"As a Wolverine, I think we
should hold ourselves to higher
standards," Dirnberger said.
Amanda Caldwell, chair of
the University's chapter of Col-
lege Democrats, said she has
received various e-mails from
members requesting informa-
tion about the upcoming speech,
including students not involved
with the organization inquiring
about obtaining tickets.
"We are all very excited for
him to visit," Caldwell said.
Caldwell said she expects
that the president will discuss

to increased anti-immigration
enforcement.
AATA CEO Michael Ford spoke
in favor of the plan at the Jan. 16
meeting, and answered further
questions from council members
last night. Ford told the council
that Salem, Sylvan, Bridgewater
and Saline Townships are the only
four municipalities in the county
that have yet to commit to the new
plan.
During the public hearing por-
tion of last night's meeting, about
40 speakers - including support-
ers and opponents of the proposed
plan - spent approximately two
hours taking 3-minute turns to
voice their opinions to City Coun-
cil members.
Michael Benson, president of
Rackham Student Government,
said while the graduate student

several large publishers, includ-
ing Pearson, McGraw-Hill,
Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and
Dorling Kindersley, to produce
e-textbooks.
Helene Neu, director of the
University's elementary French
program, said she is skeptical
about student receptiveness
toward the new apps.
A recent CTools survey sug-
gested that students wouldn't be
particularly interested in using
e-textbooks. In the survey, SO
percent of respondents cited "on
paper" as their preferred method
of reading documents - an over-
whelming majority compared to
11 percent of those who chose
"computer screen," 5 percent
who prefer a tablet computer, 3
percent who prefer an e-reader
and 1 percent who answered
"other."
Bryn Hauk, a specialist at
Michigan Book and Supply, said
despite the influx in use of elec-
tronic devices for reading, he
does not view e-textbooks as a
threat to the sale of paper text-
books.
"(E-textbooks) could have the
potential to impact sales," Hauk
said. "But with (our) new rental
program, I think we'll still have
the ability to sell a lot of books."
However, Hauk said being
able to save money on books by
purchasingthem digitally is ben-
eficial to students.
"If it saves students money, I
think it's great, and bookstores
can always adapt," she said.
Hauk noted that e-textbooks
financial strains on students and
highlight research being done at
the University, adding that his
speech will likely be related to
his State of the Union address
tonight.
In addition to college afford-
ability, Rackham student
Hakeem Jefferson said he antic-
ipates Obama to speak about job
growth or educational initia-
tives - topics he said he thinks
are important to improve the
state's economy.
"I'm excited that the presi-
dent's coming to town," Jeffer-
son said. "I think it's important
for him to come to town not only
because he's looking to get elect-
ed in November, but because
Michigan probably needs to
hear more about his jobs plan
and ... know more about what
he's going to do to help the econ-
omy improve."
Nursing freshman Monica
Sehgal said she's happy that the
president is returning to cam-
pus following his 2010 Spring
Commencement address. But,
because this is Obama's second
trip to the University in the past
two years, Sehgal said the presi-
dent should also make an effort
to visit other colleges in Michi-
gan.
"I feel like he's coming to the
University of Michigan because
it's a liberal school," Sehgal said.
LSA junior Ifeoma Dike
argued that Obama represents
a stark contrast to former Presi-
dent George W. Bush, who didn't
visit the University during his
eight years in office.
"For me, it's very monumen-
tal because I know this is his
second time coming," Dike said.

about," Hauk said.
LSA sophomore Bayan Fou-
nas said she would rather pur-
chase a textbook than use an
app, because she is more inclined
to read a physical copy of a book
rather than an electronic copy.
"I personally prefer books
on paper, for that more authen-
tic feel," Founas said. "It's also
more uncomfortable reading
from a lit screen."
LSA Freshman Yohei Kane-
hara said though he would be
interested in the apps, he would
only purchase them for certain
classes.
"I'd probably get a real text-
book for classes involving more
note-taking and to highlight
text, like in (general chemis-
try)," Kanehara said. "But I
would get an electronic text-
book for something I'm just
reading."
Like Founas, LSA sophomore
Jeff Duncan said he is not par-
ticularly interested in using the
new technology, since many
professors post their readings
on CTools or programs like
Wiki, that provide free access to
written works.
"In some of my classes my
teacher has a Wiki set up - I
would prefer that across the
board," Duncan said.
"It's really good for our genera-
tion and for the school."
Like Sehgal, Dike said other
cities, like Detroit, would benefit
from a visit from the president.
"If he came to Detroit, I
think that would show that he
is benevolent, and that he is
very interested in rebuilding the
community," Dike said.
LSA junior Gabriela Recinos
said Ann Arbor's central loca-
tion makes it an ideal place for
Obama's speech.
"Ann Arbor is a pretty good
place because a lot of people can
come," Recinos said. "People
from (Ypsilanti) can come, peo-
ple from Detroit can come and
hopefully people from outside of
Ann Arbor will come."
Rackham student Brad Kent
said he is looking forward to
hearing Obama elaborate on
issues discussed in his State of
the Union address.
"I'm glad that he's coming,
and I'm excited that he's going
to come after he gives the State
of the Union address so we can
hear him expound on his plans,"
Kent said.
LSA freshman Ken Leaton
said he is looking forward to
hearing Obama discuss his plans
leading into November's 2012
election.
"I'm definitely excited to
see him because I'm interested
to hear what he'll say for the
upcoming election, "Leaton
said. "I will definitely try to go."

President Barack Obama takes the stage at the 2010 Spring Commencement ceremony held at Michigan Stadium on May
1, 2010.

From Page 1
said in a statement to The Michi-
gan Daily that the University is
excited to welcome Obama back
to campus.
"As a public research univer-
sity, we share his commitment
to a strong future for our state
and our nation," Coleman said in
the statement. "We are particu-
larly honored that he will visit
following his State of the Union
address."
Political Science Prof. Ken
Kollman said winning the sup-
port of a "core constituency" of
working and middle class voters
in Michigan would be crucial to
Obama's re-election.
"Winning Michigan is very
important to his re-election,"
Kollman said. "It's also a state
where he can cash some chips in.
He can take a lot of credit for sav-
ing the Big Three or at least two
of the Big Three. He is in a fight
for working-class white voters all
over the country, and there are
a lot of such voters in Michigan
that ... appreciate what he did for
the Michigan economy but are
also worried about future job
prospects."
Michael Traugott, a research
professor at the University's
Institute for Social Research,
added that Obama may have
chosen the University due to
his working relationship with
University President Mary Sue
Coleman or his connection with
Valerie Jarrett, a senior advis-
er to the president and a Law
School alum.
"I think there's probably a
variety of reasons (he's com-
ing)," Traugott said. "One of
them is, of course, that in the
fall, Michigan will be an impor-
tant state for its electoral votes."
Last June, Coleman was one
of six university presidents from
around the country to join with
Obama in creating the Advanced
Manufacturing Partnership,
a joint venture between the
Obama administration and uni-
versities to increase the number
of advanced manufacturing jobs
in the United States and develop
more sophisticated manufactur-

Event Details

ing processes.
Traugott added that the
proximity of Michigan's Feb.
28 Republican presidential pri-
mary could be another incentive
for the president to visit to Ann
Arbor this week. He noted that
Obama will probably tailor the
speech to discuss his policies
that are popular with Michi-
gan voters, including the 2009
bailouts of General Motors and
Chrysler.
"There will be an interest in
framing the Michigan Republi-
can primary in terms of topics
that he thinks he has a particu-
lar advantage on, including
unemployment and the bailout
of two of the Big Three automo-
bile companies," Traugott said.
Despite the state's upcoming
primary, Obama's main focus
will be continuing to mobilize
Democratic support, particu-
larly against the past economic
policies of the Republican candi-
dates, Kollman said.
"His big thing now is to try to
draw contrast between himself
and the Republican Party as a
whole and to try to be running
against them as a party," Koll-
man said. "He doesn't exactly
know who his opponent will be
yet, but no matter who it is, he's
going to try to tie them to eco-
nomic policies that are seen as
not willing to step up places like
Michigan," Kollman said.
The Ann Arbor Police Depart-
ment, along with the Universi-
ty's Department of Public Safety
and the U.S. Secret Service, has
been working to prepare for
Obama's visit, Ann Arbor Police
Chief Barnett Jones said.
"The president's coming to
town, and every measure will be
taken," Jones said.
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hief-
tje said the law enforcement
agencies are workingtogether to
prepare for the visit. Hieftje said
that while Ann Arbor is used to
hosting big events, "everybody's
on deck when the president
comes to town."
"Aside from having the presi-
dent come, and obviously folks
like that, we also host a lot of
very large events in town, (like)

the largest art fair in the coun-
try," Hieftje said. "Seven times a
year, Michigan Stadium is filled,
so we're used to big events and
traffic control, (and) I think it
will be well-handled."
Obama was the fourth presi-
dent to give a commencement
speech in Ann Arbor, following
former presidents Bill Clinton in
2007, George H. W. Bush in 1991
and Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964.
Other former presidents have
delivered historic speeches at
the University. Then-Senator
John F. Kennedy famously
announced his intention to cre-
ate the Peace Corps program
from the steps of The Michigan
Union on Oct. 14, 1960 as he was
running for the presidency. For-
mer President Gerald R. Ford
also began his ultimately unsuc-
cessful 1976 re-election cam-
paign at a rally at Crisler Arena.
In his address to the 2010
graduating class, Obama
stressed the need for civic
involvement and discussed the
difficult economic environment
that University graduates would
face as they entered the work
force.
"The fact is, when you leave
here today, you will search for
work in an economy that is still
emerging from the worst cri-
sis since the Great Depression,"
Obama said in his speech. "You
live in a century where the speed
with which jobs and industries
move across the globe is forcing
America to compete like never
before."

body supports regional transpor-
tation, he personally believes the
pending legislation needs addi-
tional work.
"On behalf of the graduate stu-
dents of the University of Michi-
gan, we certainly support the
initiative," Benson said. "I think
some of the details - specifically
the financing - need to be worked
out."
Ypsilanti Mayor Paul Schreiber,
who spoke in the public hearing
section of the meeting, said he also
supported the measure.
"Think macroscopically, think
about how bringing people in is
going to help your city," Schreiber
said.
Several opponents of the mea-
sure spoke as well, showing con-
cern with the cost of the plan.
Council member Jane Lumm
(I-Ward 2) and several other
opponents of the bill said they felt
further public input was neces-
sary before creating a new county-

wide authority.
"I want to thank the folks at
AATA for their patience," Lumm
said. "I certainly support the post-
ponement, and look forward to
gettingthe final plans."
Throughout the night, several
speakers, including Ann Arbor
resident Clark Treneski, said they
felt prolonged discussions were
testing their patience.
"We've already had two years
of public input," Treneski said. "I
am not worried as an Ann Arbor
taxpayer, I'm not worried about
my neighbors stealing my money.
This is the time to buckle down
and move forward. I just turned
70 - I'm tired of waiting."
In an interview following the
public hearings, City Council
member Sabra Briere (D-Ward 1)
said she was happy to see a large
amount of public interest over the
matter, as reflected in the expan-
sive amount of speakers present at
last night's meeting.

"I'm really pleased with the
large amount of speakers, it's not
only important, but it's significant
that the opinions are pretty evenly
balanced," Briere said. "... It's nice
to see that a lot of people care
enough to come out and that we
can hear different perspectives."
COUNCIL PASSES RESOLU-
TION IN SUPPORT OF IMMI-
GRANT RIGHTS
Earlier in the meeting, several
citizens spoke during the public
commentary section in support of
a resolution to oppose increased
anti-immigration enforcement in
the city. The council later passed
the resolution.
In support of the proposal,
audience members held signs
advocating for immigrant rights
during the meeting. Proponents
who addressed council said they
felt the resolution is an important
part of the effort to stop the unfair

deportation of immigrants they
believe to be hardworking and
non-threatening to society.
Martha Valadez, School of
Social Work representative for
Central Student Government, said
in an interview after speaking to
council that the resolution would
assure residents that Ann Arbor is
in tune with federal-level legisla-
tion proposals.
"The resolution would support
immigrant families in the Ann
Arbor community to prevent the
deportation and detainment of
immigrants who aren't serious
criminals, which is basically what
the national legislation is trying
to do" Valadez said. "It will show
that the city is aware of these
issues and we want to make sure
we can support them as much as
we can."
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hief-
tje said the resolution ensures
that people are aware of the city's
stance on a controversial issue.

"It is very appropriate for our
community ... what we're talking
about here is objecting to people
with long standing ties to the
community from being jerked
from their homes by a process
that I think in some ways has got-
ten out of control," Hieftje said.
Ann Arbor resident Joseph
Summers, vicar of the Episcopal
Church of the Incarnation, said
he opposes aggressive measures
that tear apart immigrant fami-
lies.
"Our public policies are a
reflection of our core values and
who we are," Summers said. "In
recent years we've seen immi-
gration customs enforcement
known as 'ICE' acting like goons
for the Imperial forces from Star
Wars, breaking down doors in
the middle of the night, and ter-
rifying families, and separating
husbands and wives from their
children. It's simply unaccept-
able."

British woman becomes first
to ski alone across Antarctica

Italian Coast Guard scuba divers carry away the recovered bodies of two victims of the grounded cruise ship Costa Concor-
dia off the Tuscan island of Giglio, Italy, yesterday.
. .
To bdiles recovered
froI talian cruise ship e

10 days after the
accident 15 people
found, 17 remain
missing
ROME (AP) - Nudged gen-
tly by the tides off Tuscany, the
capsized Costa Concordia has
been deemed stable enough on
its rocky perch for salvagers to
begin pumping fuel oil from its
giant tanks as early as today.
The cruise liner, its hull
gashed by a reef and pocked by
holes blasted by divers searching
for the missing, yieldedtwo more
bodies yesterday, 10 days after
the accident. The corpses of two
women were found in the luxury
liner's Internet cafe, now 55 feet
(17 meters) underwater.
Tables, desks, elegant uphol-
stered armchairs and cabinets
bobbed in the sea as divers guid-
ed the furniture out of the holes
to clear space for their explora-
tion inside.
So far, the bodies of 15 people
have been found, most of them
in the submerged portion of the
vessel, while 17 others remain
unaccounted for. Authori-
ties said earlier reports that an

unregistered Hungarian woman
had called friends from the ship
before it flipped over turned out
to be groundless.
The Concordia rammed a reef
and capsized Jan. 13 off the tiny
Tuscan island of Giglio as it was
carrying 4,200 passengers and
crew on a Mediterranean cruise.
Salvage experts received the
green light yesterday to start
pumping fuel soon from the dou-
ble-lined tanks of the Concordia.
The weekslong fuel-removal
operation aims to avert a pos-
sible environmental catastrophe
in the waters off Giglio, part of
a protected seven-island marine
park.
Officials said the pumping
would be carried out as divers
continue the search for the miss-
ing since instrument readings
have determined the Concordia
was not at risk of sliding into
deeper waters and being swal-
lowed by the sea.
"The ship is stable," said Fran-
co Gabrielli, head of the national
civil protection agency. "There
is no problem or danger that it is
about to drop onto much lower
seabed."
Meanwhile, an oily film was
spotted about 300 yards (meters)

from the capsized vessel by offi-
cials flying in a helicopter and
by residents of Giglio, Gabrielli's
office said. Samples were being
analyzed, but preliminary obser-
vations indicated the slick is a
light oil and not from heavy fuel
inside the Concordia's tanks.
Absorbent panels put around
the area seemto have at least par-
tially absorbed the oil, authori-
ties said.
The ship's Italian captain,
Francesco Schettino, is under
house arrest near Naples, fac-
ing possible charges of man-
slaughter, causing a shipwreck
and abandoning his vessel while
some people were still aboard.
He has insisted that he was coor-
dinating rescue operations from
a lifeboat and then from shore.
The ship's operator, Costa
Crociere SpA, has distanced
itself from the captain, contend-
ing he made an unauthorized
detour from the ship's autho-
rized route. Schettino, however,
has reportedly told investigators
that Costa officials requested
that he sail close to Giglio in a
publicity move.
In a statement issued late
Monday, Costa said it would
refund passengers the full cost

Aston traveled
1,084 miles since
November
BUENOS AIRES (AP) - Brit-
ish adventurer Felicity Aston
became the first woman to ski
alone across Antarctica yester-
day, haulingtwo sledges around
crevasses and over mountains
into endless headwinds, past the
South Pole and onward to the
coastal ice shelf, persevering for
59 days in near-total solitude.
She made it to her destina-
tion ahead of schedule, using
nothing but her own strength to
cover 1,084 miles (1,744 kilome-
ters) from her starting point on
the Leverett Glacier on Nov. 25
to Hercules Inlet.
The most surprising thing
about her journey, she said,
was how emotional it proved
to be, from the moment she
was dropped off alone, through
every victory and defeat along
the way.
"I'm not a particularly weepy
person, and yet anyone who
has been following my tweets
can see me bursting into tears,"
she said in an interview with
The Associated Press yesterday
while waiting for a plane to pick
her up.
"When I saw the coastal
mountains that marked my end
point for the first time, I liter-
ally just stopped in my tracks
and bawled my eyes out," she
added. "All these days I thought
there was no chance I was going
to make it in time to make that
last flight off Antarctica, and
yet here I am with three days to
spare."
Aston also set another record:
the first human to ski solo, across
Antarctica, using only her own
muscles. A male-female team
earlier skied across Antarctica
without kites or machines, but
Aston is the first to do this alone.
Aston, 34, grew up in Kent,
England, and studied physics
and meteorology. A veteran of
expeditions in subzero environ-

ments, she worked for the Brit-
ish weather service at a base in
Antarctica and has led teams
on ski trips in the Antarctic, the
Arctic and Greenland.
But this was the first time
she traveled so far, so alone,
and she said the solitude posed
her biggest challenge. In such
an extreme environment, the
smallest mistakes can prove
treacherous. Alone with one's
thoughts, the mind can play
tricks. Polar adventurers usual-
ly take care to watch their team-
mates for signs of hypothermia,
which is easier to diagnose in
others than yourself, she said.
She thought she was done
for when her two butane light-
ers failed high in the Transant-
arctic Mountains, where it got
"really very cold."
"Suddenly I realized that
without a lighter working, I
can't light my stove, I can't
melt snow to make water, and I
won't have any water to drink,
and that becomes a very serious
problem," she said. "It's quite
stressful. It was just a matter of
every single day, looking at my
kit, and thinking what could go
wronghere and what canIdo to
prevent it?"
She did have a small box of
safety matches, and counted
and re-counted every one until
the lighters started working
again at lower altitude, she said.
This Antarctic summer has
seen the centennial of Roald
Amundsen's conquest of the
South Pole, where Britons still
lament that R.F. Scott's team
arrived for England days later,
demoralized to see Norway's
flag. Scott and his entire team
then died on their way out, and
some of their bodies weren't
found for eight months.
Aston had modern technol-
ogy in her favor: She kept fam-
ily and supporters updated
and received their responses
via Twitter and Facebook, and
broadcast daily phone reports
online. She carried two satellite
phones to communicate with a

support team, and a GPS device
that reported her location
throughout. She also had two
supply drops - one at the pole
and one part way to her finish
line - so that she could travel *
with a lighter load. Otherwise,
her feat was unassisted.
While others have trav-
eled farther using kites, sails,
machinery or dogs (now banned
for fear of infecting wildlife
with canine diseases), she did it
on her own strength.
Aston, whose journey also
helped raise money for monu-
ments to the 29 Britons killed
on Antarctica since Scott, had to
fight near-constant headwinds
across the vast central plateau
to the pole. Then she turned
toward Hercules Inlet, push-
ing through thick, fresh snow,
until she reached her goal on the
Ronne Ice Shelf, a spot within
a small plane's reach of a base
camp on Union Glacier where
the Antarctic Logistics and
Expeditions company provides
logistical support to each sum-
mer's expeditions.
With skies clearing yesterday,
Aston tweeted that she's been
promised red wine and a hot
shower after she gets picked up.
"A very long, very hot shower,"
she emphasized. "It's something
I haven't had in quite a longtime
now!"
From there, she'll join dozens
of other Antarctic adventur-
ers on the last flight out, a huge
Russian cargo plane that will
take her to Chile. Then she will
fly home next week to Kent, in
southeast England.
There, after two months of
little but freeze-dried food, she
can look forward to chicken pie,
her mother said.
"I think there will be lots of
cuddles, lots of hugs, it will be
quite emotional," said Jackie
Aston, 61.
Felicity Aston, pondering her
last hours of solitude yesterday,
told the AP she felt both joy and
overwhelming sadness at finish-
ing.

Adaptations not 'Great'

Uplifting follow-up

The "Harry Potter" movies
were better than the books. Now
that I have your attention, it's
time to discuss an important
matter: adapting a book into a
movie. It's an
old topic, but
an important
one nonethe-
less, given a
movie slated
to hit the-
aters one year
from now: JACOB
"The Great AXELRAD
Gatsby."
Despite
its distant release date, a recent
article in The New York Times
reminded me of an important
fact concerning this oft-adapted
novel: You can't make a good
movie version of "Gatsby."
I first learned this lesson
when my 11th-grade-English
teacher showed us the third
incarnation of "The Great Gats-
by" on film after finishing our
unit on the book. I was stunned.
How could they take a novel I
really liked and make such an
awful movie that was so stilted,
slow and boring?
As the story goes, Nick Car-
raway, a young Ivy League grad,
moves to the West Egg of Long
Island upon graduation to begin
his life. The year is 1922 and it's
the Jazz Age - the film's inclu-
sion of all of that era's gaudy
splendor creates a rich backdrop,
complete with bootlegging and
phrases like "old sport." Nick
soon meets his neighbor, the
mysterious Jay Gatsby. Gatsby
is in love with Daisy Buchanan,
who is in turn in a relationship
with Tom Buchanan, a kind
of meathead in fancy clothes.
Gatsby throws lavish parties
and pines after Daisy, but does
not ultimately get the girl of his
dreams. That's about it. Seri-
ously.
So far, there have been six
film versions made of "Gatsby,"
including a silent film and a
Korean adaptation. After the

Chairlift's new
release 'Something'
evokes nostalgia
By KATIE STEEN
Daily Arts Writer
If you've heard "Bruises," the
song popularized by a 2008 iPod
commercial, then you've heardthe
music of Chair-
lift. The band ****
has changed
a bit since its Chairlift
one-hit suc-
cess. Two of its Something
members ended Columbia
their romantic
relationship, resulting in the dude
quitting the band and the threat
of legal action, but singer Caroline
Polachek has handled the split
just fine. In Chairlift's latest music
video, made for the song"Amanae-
monesia," Polachek does not have
grass stains; she has a mint-green
unitard. She's not falling down;
she's prancing around in a trans-
fixing interpretive dance. And she
is neither black nor blue.
For the band's sophomore
album Something, Polachek and
partner-in-crime Patrick Wim-
berly made an effort to ditch the
moodier sound of their first LP,
Does You Inspire You. Polachek
aimed to please a much wider
audience with this album, telling
Pitchfork, "I want to make stuff
that a 10-year-old might bear
coming outof the radio and think,
'Yeah! I love this!'"
Not all of the songs off Some-
thing are completely kid-friendly,
though. In the first track, "Side-
walk Safari," Polachek con-
templates various methods of
vengeance - guns, hit men, poi-
son and eventually hitting her
victim with a car. But "Sidewalk
Safari" is fun: a blend of Atari-
esque melodies and the elongated

Steve is sad because he ate his twin.
advantages of female vocals. The
song's ending sounds slightly like
a futuristic race car speeding
away - a reminder that Chairlift
may seem sweet, but really, its
singer may want to run you over
with her car.
But Something isn't spiteful.
The album enters a sort of dreamy
void in its second half with the
track "Frigid Spring." Polachek's
voice surfs over melodic lines,
changing direction with rapidity
and smoothness. The next song,
"Turning," has a similar, REM-
cycle-inspired feel to it. Almost
everything about it remains vague
and ambiguous - where the song
is going, what the emotion is, what
Polachek is actually singing, to
name a few. The most unexpected
aspect of "Turning" is its lack of
change; the song is repetitive and
seems to build up to nothing. But
Chairlift doesn't frustrate -it
turns monotony into serenity.
While Something has a shorter
length than Does You Inspire You,
Chairlift takes its time with each
song. For its first album, the band
slapped together a peculiar array
of ideas, resulting in a scatter-
brained mix of tracks with subject
matters ranging from witches to
condoms. With Something, the
songs are more inspired and con-
nected, maintaining a heavily

'80s-inspired sound that remain
consistent but doesn't become
tedious or unoriginal.
However, when Chairlift
becomes too enthralled with '8s
throwbacks, it ends up with track-
like "Cool as a Fire" that becon:
cheesy and tired with their over:
the-top nostalgia. The song -
heartfelt proclamation of despair
over a lost love - lasts four min
utes and shows up in the middi:
of the album, a mopey interludc

Tough CCHA is nothing for
Michigan to worry about

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Bench sees extra

ake Superior State has the
eighth-best record in the
CCHA. For all intents and
purposes, that's not good.
Ohio State has the best record
inthe CCHA. For all intents and
purposes, that's pretty good.
The Buckeyes and the Lakers
play a series
this week-
end, with six
points on the
line. In most
years, a Janu-
ary matchup
between an
eighth-placeJ
and first-place EVERETT
team wouldn't COOK
be too signifi-
cant.
But now let's imagine that
there's a significant ice shortage
in the greater Midwest area and
the rest of the conference gets
the weekend off. Oh, and imagine
Alaska doesn't have snow either
- I'm not creative enough to
come with a scenario where Alas-
ka doesn't have snow in January.
In this severely ice-lacking
scenario, a sweep by Lake Supe-
rior State would vault it into first
place in the conference. One
weekend sweep - that's what
separates No. 1 from No. 8 in the
CCHA right now. The confer-
ence is more packed than the bus
shipping Engineering nerds up to
North Campus. And with roughly
two months left in the season,
nine teams have a shot at finish-
ing first.
It's not like the conference is
full of scrubs that can't separate
from one another. There are cur-
rently eight teams in the Pairwise
top 17. Though it's bereft of a
standout team that's a lock to
win the CCHA, this conference is
loaded from top to bottom - the
difference between first place and
not even securing a first-round
bye in the CCHA Tournament is
just four points.
But as daunting as it maybe
to finish off the season in the
best conference in the country
successfully, the No.8 Michigan
hockey team is goingto be fine.

By MICHAEL LAURILA
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan women's basketball
coach Kevin Borseth is known
for going to his bench early and
often this season.
On Sunday, when Michi-
gan (5-2 Big Ten, 16-4 overall)
squared off against Indiana at
the Crisler Center, Borseth did
just that. He was able to play 13
different players, and it was a
happy occurrence that this hap-
pened on the team's "Parent's
Day" in Ann Arbor.
With 16:25 left in the second
half, the Wolverines led by as
many as 28 points. The drubbing
of the Hoosiers enabled Borseth
to play some reserves that rarely
see the court.
"Great win, obviously," Bors-
eth said on Sunday. "Everybody
got a chance to play, and that sure
makes the locker room sweeter
after the game."
In the second half, Indiana
went on a 9-0 run, forcing Bors-
eth to revert back to the start-
ers. But it was short-lived, as the
Wolverines quickly built their
lead back up, allowing Borseth to
clear the bench once more. Other
than that Hoosier run, the bench
players had all-around success
against Indiana, combining for
18 points and 10 rebounds.
The last time Michigan played
13 players in a game was on Nov.
14 against Florida Atlantic. It
was even more significant that
the entire team played against
Indiana since so many players'
parents were there to see it.
"Everybody's parents were
here, and parents want to see
their kid play, so fortunately we
got everyone in the game and
they were able to play a little bit,"
Borseth said. "That's really key
(for them.)"
Added senior guard Courtney
Boylan: "Everybody pretty much
had a parent here, so that was
really great, because I think it's
good for the parents to get to see
everybody come in. Plus it's just
great for team camaraderie."

Along with being important
for morale, the Wolverines' abil-
ity to play the entire roster is also
beneficial for some of the young-
er players' development. Fresh-
men Brenae Harris and Cyesha
Goree saw more time than usual.
At one point in the second
half, the lineup of Harris, junior
guards Kate Thompson and
Jenny Ryan and junior forwards
Rachel Sheffer and Nya Jordan
was a preview of what Michi-
gan's starting five could look like
next year.
Though Harris has had alimit-
ed role for most of the season, the
Ohio native was a highly touted
recruit, and after Boylan's gradu-
ation, she could see more playing
time at pointguard. In the 11 con-
tests Harris has appeared in, she
has averaged 7.9 minutes and 2.1
points per game. These numbers
might not look good on the stat
sheet, but the Borseth offense
can be tough for a player just out
of high school to transition into.
"Obviously, there's a lot of
promise sitting (on the bench),"
Borseth said. "We feel good
about the kids that we've got that
are sitting down there."
Since Michigan has had a lot
of close games - seven of its
20 games have been decided
by seven points or less --the
reserves haven't seen a lotof time
on the floor. But Borseth, who
played collegiately at Lake Supe-
rior State, knows how it feels to
sit on the bench.
"I've sat there before as a
player and never got a turn to
play when my parents came, and
inside, it really hurts," Borseth
said. "It's very difficult to sit
there, I get it. A lot of those guys
are waiting for their turn."
But it won't always be that
much "sweeter," as Borseth
said. Indiana is winless in Big
Ten play, and one of the weaker
teams in the conference. When
Michigan faces No. 18 Penn State
on Thursday, the Wolverines will
look to avenge their Jan. 12 loss
at State College, and it'll be up to
the starters to accomplish that.

Fifth-year senior goaltender Shawn Hunwick has compiled a .958 save percentage for Michigan this January.

Two weeks ago, that statement
would have sounded a lot more
hollow, considering the Wolver-
ines were entering their toughest
two-week stretch of the year.
Michigan had to go on the road
against then-No. 2 Ohio State and
then at then-No. 6 Notre Dame
the next weekend, a four-game
stretch that would decide a whole
lot about the direction of the
season.
The Wolverines emerged from
that gong show of a stretch at 3-1,
sweeping the Buckeyes and split-
ting with the Fighting Irish.
The games won during that
stretch are obviously important,
but not as important as the way
Michigan played.
The Wolverines went into
Notre Dame and played their
most physical series of the year,
clawing their way to the split and
not backing down an inch. The
penalty-kill unit is back to where
it was last year with the return of

sophomore defenseman Jon Mer-
rill, and the power play actually
scored some goals on the road in
South Bend.
Most importantly, fifth-year
senior goaltender Shawn Hun-
wick is playing out of his mind
recently. His .958 save percentage
in January will keep Michigan in
the thick of things even if every
other unit has a slip in produc-
tion. 163 saves in 170 shots is more
than good - it's CCHA champion
good.
And this team is getting hot at
the right time. Its loss at Notre
Dame was its first since Dec. 9.
Michigan has traditionally been
a second-half team, and this year
isn't looking any different. A lot
of things could happen over the
next two months, but right now,
the Wolverines look as good as
any team in the CCHA. Michigan
just played its two best oppo-
nents of 2012 - and its upcoming
schedule is a lot more manageable

than January was.
The bye weekend following the
Notre Dame series comes at the
perfect time, giving Michigan a
chance to recover physically. The
Wolverines then close out the
regular season against two of the
worst teams in the conference,
Northern Michigan and Bowling
Green, which makes a late push at
first place much more likely.
In October, Hunwick was top-
pled over in the net by a Northern
Michigan player. He stood up and
decked the Wildcat, getting him-
self thrown out of the game.
In January, Hunwick was
toppled over in the net by a Notre
Dame player. He stood up and
skated away as a swarm of Wol-
verines flew toward the net to
protect their goalie.
Tough conference or not,
Michigan is going to be fine.

RPI of 24 means that it shouldn't it keeps them believing in them-
have to worry about making the selves even more."

With trips to Columbus and
East Lansing looming in the next
two weeks, a date at relatively
weaker Purdue (4-3, 14-6) seems
like the perfectopportunity forthe
Wolverines to snare their first road
contest of the season.
Having topped Illinois at home
and bested Minnesota in Min-
neapolis, the Boilermakers have a
couple solid wins under their belt.
But they've also been blown out by
Michigan State and Penn State on
the road, and their loss on Jan. 12
to Wisconsin ended their 26-game
winning streak at home.
But Purdue remains a solid
team. The bigger problem for
Michigan is that Mackey Arena
has been a house of horrors for the
Wolverines in recent years. The
Boilermakers have won the last six
games played in West Lafayette -
Michigan hasn't won at Mackey
since Feb. 19, 2003. The last time
Beilein's team tripped there was
in 2010, when the Wolverines

couldn't overcome the ejection of
Manny Harris and felliby10 points.
"Down (in West Lafayette), it's
usually been a really good first half,
but they just wear you down with
their defense eventually," Beilein
said. "We've got to do everything
we can to keep that from happen-
ing."
The Purdue attack is once again
spearheaded by Robbie Hum-
mel, a player who opposing teams
must feel like has been there for-
ever. The fifth-year senior is in the
midst of a successful comeback
from two ACL tears, the first suf-
fered toward the end of the season
two years ago and the second in
the team's very first practice last
season. While point guard Lewis
Jackson and 3-point marksman
Ryne Smith bolster the offense,
the key to stopping the Boiler-
makers is still to stymie Hummel,
who's averaging15.4 points and 6.3
rebounds per game. The forward
has struggled a bit in his team's last

three games, shooting just 10-for-
42 in that span. Hummel was par-
ticularly ineffective in Saturday's
loss to Michigan State, scoring just
two points, but Beilein said he's
still a "tremendous" player.
Michigan knows what it's like
to have a star player in an offen-
sive funk. Sophomore guard Tim
Hardaway Jr. has not looked like
his normal high-scoring self in
recent weeks, averaging just 9.3
points per game while Burke has
become the team's go-to threat.
It's a reversal from last sea-
son for Hardaway Jr. The Miami
native turned it on in Big Ten play
last season, especially from deep,
shooting 44.2 percent on 3-point-
ers during conference play. This
year, Hardaway Jr.'s gotten colder
in the Big Ten. He's shot 19.2 per-
cent on 3-pointers and is just 1-for-
16 in the last three games.
Meanwhile, sophomore for-
ward Evan Smotrycz continues to
disappoint. After enjoying the best

all-around stretch of his career
in December, Smotrycz has aver-
aged just 3.9 points per game since
scoring 10 in the Big Ten opener
against Penn State.
"You have a flow to your team,"
Beilein said. "Last year, we really
had a flow with Darius, and Stu,
and Zack, and everyone in concert
all the time. ... Right now, we're
trying to develop the same flow,
and sometimes that will throw a
good player just out of his timing."
The Wolverines have not
fared well on the road against .
teams which themselves just suf-
fered a disappointing loss away
from home, falling to both Iowa
and Arkansas. At the same time,
Michigan defeated Wisconsin and
Michigan State when both teams
were coming off losses.
That's the situation on Tuesday
night, and Purdue is 5-0 this sea-
son after a loss. With Michigan
desperate for its first road triumph,
something's going to give.
