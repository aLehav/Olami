Last weekend, The Michigan 
Daily 
reporters 
went 
to 
11 
different protests, driving 269 
miles and speaking to almost 100 
people in 10 cities about why they 
came out. Some said it was their 
first time protesting. Many more 
said they were used to protests in 
big cities, but they never expected 
protests of this magnitude — or 
even protests in general — in their 
suburban 
hometowns. 
When 
asked if not before, why now, 
almost everyone had the same 
answer: People are tired, and they 
want change. 
This 
article 
is 
the 
first 
installment of a four-part series 
on police brutality protests across 
Metro Detroit over the weekend 
of June 6 and 7. Check back at 
michigandaily.com this week for 
parts two, three and four. 
It was a sight many said they 
thought they’d never see. 
Ulysses Wright and Charlie 
Evans were working at the 
Hungry Howie’s in Ferndale 
on Saturday afternoon when 
thousands 
started 
flooding 
past 
their 

storefront window, marching 
in protest of police brutality. 
The two went outside to take 
in the sight, which left them 
speechless and nearly moved 
Wright to tears. Wright said 
the crowd meant so much to 
him because he is a Black man 
in America, but also because 
he has never seen people come 
together like this.
“It makes me want to cry, 
like you don’t really care about 
anything else in the world,” 
Wright said. “I think the world 
kind of stopped for me, and I’ve 
never had that feeling. There 
was no existence except taking it 
all in. It’s hard to put it in words, 
because that’s just cheapening 
it. It was like literally if God 
himself came to show us he was 
God, that was it.”
Over the weekend, tens of 
thousands wore masks to march 
in suburbs throughout Metro 
Detroit against police brutality, 
joining 
millions 
across 
the 
country and around the world 
in wave after wave of protests 
sparked by the killing of George 
Floyd.
Throughout the latter half 
of the 1900s, the growth of the 
suburbs often came at Detroit’s 
expense, as capital and white 
residents moved out of the city 
in droves while Black residents 

were prevented from following. 
To this day, Detroit is unique 
among other metropolitan hubs 
across the country in that much 
of the wealth is concentrated in 
its outlying suburbs rather than 
in the city itself. 
The 
majority 
of 
those 
arrested in the first several 
days of Detroit’s protests lived 
in the suburbs. Through the 
week, protests began spreading 
to Detroit’s suburbs, many of 
which are predominantly white. 
According to Sterling Heights 
resident 
Megan 
Williams, 
her ancestors had been slaves 
and her mother had walked 
with Martin Luther King Jr. 
She marched in her very first 
protest in Ferndale on Saturday 
afternoon.
“We don’t want to repeat 
cycles,” Williams said. “I refuse 
to birth a child into a world 
where they have to do any more 
than us.”
Below 
are 
some 
of 
the 
protesters from Saturday on 
their experiences with racism 
and what this current moment 
means to them. You can read 
more 
from 
protesters 
on 
Saturday in Part Two of this 
series coming soon.

‘When one of us hurts, we all hurt’: 
Tens of thousands protest racism

Paulina Rajski/Daily
Content Warning: Sexual assault, 
sexual abuse.

A 
Twitter 
account 
created 
Wednesday 
called 
“Assaulters 
at 
UMich” posted a series of tweets 
calling out alleged sexual assaulters 
on the University of Michigan campus, 
including a professor. The account 
asked for direct messages from students 
with claims of sexual assault and posted 
these submissions to their page with 
the name and picture of the alleged 
assaulter along with any fraternity or 
athletic team affiliation.
The Daily reached out to the creator 
of the account via direct message, 
whose identity cannot be verified and 
asked to remain anonymous due to 
safety concerns. The creator told The 
Daily via Twitter direct messages that 
they wanted to help survivors because 
the University has failed to protect 
survivors from their abusers.
“At first I wasn’t sure if people 
would send in their stories, but once 
individuals started sharing their stories 
I was shocked at the sheer amount of 
individuals who have gone through 
these (traumas),” they said. “It just 
shows how prevalent sexual assaults 
(are) and that UMich needs to do a 
better job taking action.” 
The creator said though they are not 
able to verify the submissions of alleged 
abuse that they are receiving, they are 
vigilant about deleting posts that are 
proven to be untrue.

The University of Michigan 
hosted a virtual town hall titled 
“Constructive Conversations for 
Societal Change” on Friday, in soli-
darity with the protests that have 
erupted across the nation against 
racism and police brutality. The 
town hall was moderated by Rob-
ert M. Sellers, vice provost of equity 
and inclusion and chief diversity 
officer, and focused on providing a 
platform for the University of Mich-
igan community to come together.
“Our conversation today marks 
our collective recommitment as 
individuals and as a university to 
ending systemic racism in our soci-
ety and within our institution,” 
Sellers said. “In doing so, we affirm 
that Black lives matter. We recog-
nize that this conversation is not the 
solution, nor can it be our response, 
our only response, to the senseless 
killing of George Floyd and far too 
many other African Americans. It’s 
only a necessary start to acknow-
ledging our collective pain and out-
rage.”
LSA senior Darlena York shared 
her experiences with racism on 
campus, citing a survey from a pol-
itical science class she took and the 
effect of the survey on students’ 
mental health. 
“It makes students not want to 
participate in class, not want to 
go to class, because it’s very detri-
mental to our mental health, detri-
mental to how we want to perform 
in class and it’s detrimental to our 
overall well-being as students,” 
York said. “A lot of my experiences 
aren’t that positive when reflecting 
on racial inequality on campus. It’s 
very exhausting as a student lead-
er sometimes, having to constantly 
combat those things.”
Rackham student Naomi Mae 
Wilson, who has been a commun-
ity organizer for the past 10 years, 
spoke about her involvement in 
fighting systemic racism at the 
University of California at Berke-
ley, New York University and in 
her communities at the University 

of Michigan. She emphasized that 
fighting for change can be exhaust-
ing and traumatic.
“Having been in the work for 10 
years, it’s not really, really long but 
it’s a lot for me. My experience and 
my feelings are both exhaustion and 
also a deep, deep fire in my spirit to 
fight for justice and to make sure 
that we have change,” Wilson said. 
“Young people are out there and 
they are dedicating their childhoods 
for justice which in some ways, in a 
lot of ways, is beautiful and in a lot 
of ways is incredibly sad that we 
lift up these young folks who are 
out there, to march and demand for 
their lives to matter.”
Riana Anderson, an assistant 
professor at the School of Pub-
lic Health, spoke about the link 
between systemic racism and the 
disparate impact of COVID-19 
on the Black community and the 
effects of the protests on mental 
and physical health, making people 
more susceptible to the dangers of 
COVID-19.
“My work shows how racial acts 
exact a toll on psychological out-
comes like anxiety, depression and 
trauma, even if it’s not personally 
happening to us, as is the case with 
so many of the virtual experiences 
we viewed online,” Anderson said. 
“Our bodies also react through 
physiological 
processes, 
like 
increased blood pressure, quick-
ened heart rate and heightened 
production of stress hormones, 
eroding our physical health and 
wreaking havoc on our normal 
stress responses including regulat-
ed breathing, which of course ties 
back to COVID.”
Eddie L. Washington Jr., the 
executive director of the Division of 
Public Safety and Security, shared 
his emotional reaction to the video 
of George Floyd’s murder.
“When I saw the video, the first 
thing I thought about was just the 
loss of life. And I think about the 
loss of life and the impacts that that 
has directly on (Floyd’s) family, on 
the community, on Blacks specific-
ally,” Washington Jr. said. “It causes 
a spark of images that I think about 
for most of my life, images from 
the 60s and the 70s. I think about 
the loss of trust for some, but the 
increase of distrust for others.”

‘U’ hosts discussion 
on societal change

The challenges that international 
students face in attending American 
universities are plentiful, ranging 
from intense culture shock to rising 
tuition fees. Add the COVID-19 
pandemic, which comes with strict 
travel 
restrictions, 
troublesome 
flights home and visa issues, and 
those challenges double.
The University’s International 
Center Director Judith Pennywell 
told the Daily that over the past 
few 
months, 
the 
center 
has 
received numerous requests for 
help regarding the pandemic and 
uncertainty for the fall semester. 
“Students are wondering about 
the availability of remote learning 
opportunities for fall and whether 
there are visa or immigration related 
implications,” 
Pennywell 
said. 
“Some students have expressed 
concerns about internship offers 
being revoked in light of COVID-19.”
Second-year Information student 
Chengyue Qiu, an international 
student 
from 
China 
and 
the 
secretary for Graduate Rackham 
International (GRIN), a student-
run organization at the University 
meant to support graduate students 
on campus, mentioned how since the 
pandemic hit, her peers have faced 
both academic and career obstacles.
“I have a lot of friends who had 
their internships canceled because 

of COVID,” Qiu said. “That’s a really 
common thing.”
Engineering alum Mohammed 
Majid had his offer as an upcoming 
software engineer at Uber rescinded 
due to the pandemic. Majid, an 
international student from India, 
shared his story on a LinkedIn post 
that spread widely throughout the 
University community.
“Hi Everyone!” the post begins. 
“Yesterday, I received a phone call 
from my recruiter: my new grad 
SWE offer from Uber was rescinded 
due to COVID-19, with 90 days 
left to find employment or risk 
deportation.”
Upon graduation, international 
students who do not want to 
return home usually apply for 
Optional Practice Training, which 
allows students to stay in the U.S. 
for a maximum of 12 months for 
employment-related training in their 
field of study. But not all companies 
choose to sponsor international 
students and some organizations 
related to defense or national 
security seldom hire or interview 
non-U.S. citizens. Students who are 
granted OPT are only allotted 90 
days of unemployment. 
In an interview with The Daily, 
Majid spoke about the grueling fall 
job recruitment process and how 
difficult it was to do it all over again 
last month. Back in September, 
he said he applied to as many as 
100 jobs and by November had a 
couple of offers — three months 
of applications, phone calls and 
interviews.

Academic and career 
dilemmas emerge as 
COVID-19 rages on

Community reflects 
virtually on protests, law 
enforcement and racism


Rackham student Aya M. Waller-
Bey was sitting in her room in 
Munger Graduate Residences when 
she heard someone else moving 
around in her suite. She got up to 
find a maintenance man, who told 
her that work would be done on two 
rooms inside her suite. Two new 
residents were expected to move in 
in a few weeks.
“He’s like, ‘Oh, there’s two 
rooms here we’re going to work on 
today and also tomorrow,’” Waller-
Bey said. “‘We might be getting two 
new people here on June 1.’”
Waller-Bey said this was the first 
she was hearing of it, and thought 
it was odd in light of the COVID-19 
pandemic.
“It was actually the maintenance 
guy who told me I should expect 
to see two new people on June 1,” 
Waller-Bey said. “Not even, you 
know, the building (administra-
tion).”
The following week, on May 
26, Waller-Bey received an email 
from University Housing, confirm-
ing that new suitemates would 
be arriving soon. The email also 
detailed 
the 
updated 
move-in 
procedures for incoming Munger 
residents, specifying that students 
would have to make appointments 
for arrival and check-in. Addition-
ally, the email specified only one 
person would be allowed to help 
residents move in and required all 
personnel involved with move-in to 
wear masks and face protections. 
University 
Housing 
later 
expanded to include additional 
protocols regarding health screen-
ings for incoming residents and 
sanitation of assistive move-in bins 
and other “common touchpoints” 
in another email to residents on 
May 28. But Waller-Bey’s concerns 
started a few weeks before any 
communication regarding incom-
ing suitemates, when, on May 12, 
University Housing sent her an 
updated contract.
A “Hold Harmless” clause was 
updated in the Community Living 

at Michigan contract with specific 
language regarding COVID-19.
“You agree to release the Uni-
versity, its agents, and employees 
from any and all damages, liabil-
ity, claims, expenses, or loss (col-
lectively, “Claims”) resulting from 
or arising out of your use of space 
within University Housing, includ-
ing those related to the potential 
exposure to contagious viruses like 
the coronavirus,” the clause reads.
Waller-Bey called the clause 
“disturbing” and described how 
this clause seems to clash with Uni-
versity Housing’s commitments to 
their residents.
“I’m no lawyer, but it just doesn’t 
make sense to … on one hand talk 
about equity and safety and pro-
moting … a safe environment for 
your students, and then on the 
other hand, say, ‘Nevertheless, if 
you get sick, we are not liable or 
responsible,’” 
Waller-Bey 
said. 
“And again, meanwhile, you are 
exposing residences, to new people 
in the places where they live.”
Residents were asked to return 
the contract within a week, but 
Waller-Bey has yet to do so, stat-
ing that she did not feel like she 
had enough information to make an 
informed decision. 
The Graduate Employees’ Orga-
nization has also taken issue with 
updated provisions in the contract. 
GEO president Sumeet Patward-
han, a Rackham student pursuing a 
doctorate in philosophy, discussed 
GEO’s response to the contract 
updates in an interview with The 
Daily.
“So GEO, as you know, is a labor 
union for graduate employees on 
campus, but our mission is to pro-
tect all graduate students on cam-
pus,” Patwardhan said. “The reason 
this (updated contract) relates to … 
GEO’s purpose in its organizing as 
a whole is because these concerns 
of graduate housing directly affect 
our members who reside in hous-
ing, or who might reside in housing 
in the future.”

Over 700 people went to the 
Ann Arbor Farmers Market on 
their bikes to join the Silent Bike 
Ride for Black Lives Matter Friday 
afternoon. Adults, elderly and chil-
dren of all races were present while 
wearing masks to the protest host-
ed by Survivors Speak, an inter-
faith council for peace and justice, 
and Bicycle Alliance of Washtenaw, 
among other local organizations. 
Not everyone had bikes: Some 
people wore roller skates or used 
skateboards to participate. Many 
signs supporting the Black Lives 
Matter movement were attached to 
bikes, some of which wrote “Fight 
racism,” “I’ll teach my kids. You 
train your cops,” or simply “Black 
Lives Matter.” Loud music blasted 
through the farmers market before 
the protest started.
Sha’Teina Grady El was recently 
victim to police brutality in Ypsi-
lanti when a police officer punched 
her in the face and arrested her 
while her husband was tased. 
Grady El spent four days in jail 
before she was released. Since the 
incident, state Sen. Jeff Irwin, 
D-Ann Arbor, drafted a bill that

requires more training for police 
in Michigan. The family is also 
currently seeking assault charges 
against the deputy who punched 
her. 
Grady El spoke to the crowd 
about her appreciation of peace-
ful protests occurring in Michigan 
and around the nation to contest 
police brutality. She said in order 
for those who commit police bru-
tality to be held accountable, peo-
ple need to be aware of everything 
the city is doing to support the 
police department.
“We have to let these legisla-
tors know that enough is enough,” 
Grady El said. “We’re holding them 
accountable. They need to do what 
we want them to do because we put 
them in office. So we need to make 
sure that we keep them account-
able, but everything that they pass 
underneath our noses. (A) lot of 
times things (are) passing –– we 
don’t know –– but we have to stay 
involved.”
William Amadeo, Grady El’s 
lawyer, shared his disappointment 
in the sheriff’s response to the 
incident. Amadeo said defending 
the officer is a sign of weakness 
because the police officer is not a 
victim — Grady El is. 
“Jerry Clayton, we watched in 
horror when you gave your press 
conference on Friday,” Amadeo 
said. “What you did a week ago 
was you defended that monster for 
45 minutes. I understand you have 

a job to do. I understand there’s 
pressures but being a man is not an 
easy task and you are not doing the 
right thing by Sha’Teina and Dan 
and their family. Let me be real 
clear to you, Sherriff Clayton, I 
know you’re watching this. You are 
not the victim. They are. At some 
point, lip service gets old. We need 
action.”
Trovious Starr, co-counsel to 
Sha’Teina Grady El’s lawyer Amad-
eo, shared his experience learning 
about police brutality as a child. 
He expressed his frustration for 
having to pass on that lesson to his 
children, which is something he 
wishes he did not have to teach.
“I thought about the time when 
I was in middle school, seventh 
grade,” Starr said. “At the Bible 
study in my grandma’s house and 
the talking, not to talk about the 
birds and bees, but the talk. This 
kind of talk is like ‘Hey, this is 
what you do if you’re ever in a situ-
ation where law enforcement has 
you detained’ … It is unfortunate 
because it’s 2020 and I still have to 
have that talk with my kids.” 
Desiraé Simmons, co-director 
of Interfaith Council for Peace and 
Justice, shared with the crowd 
about a conversation with her 
daughter, emphasizing the pres-
ence that police brutality has on 
young children.

‘Hold Harmless’ clause added to CLAM 
contract is ‘disturbing’ to students

Over 700 participants 
support the Black Lives 
Matter movement


W

e all know Karen. She 
is the minority of 30 
to 
40-year-old 
white 
women whose voice is loud despite how 
misguided and misinformed she is. 
She exudes entitlement and a superior 
“Can I speak to the manager?” attitude. 
She is unafraid to use her privilege as 
a weapon. In today’s context, she is 
audibly doubtful of any new COVID-19 
research and public-health protocols, 
especially when her long-overdue salon 
appointment is at stake. And according 
to Heather Suzanne Woods, a meme 
researcher and professor at Kansas 
State University, Karen “demands the 
world exist according to her standards 
with little regard for others, and she 
is willing to risk or demean others to 
achieve her ends.” This definition con-
tinues to evolve. 
The controversial stereotype of 
a woman named Karen has roots in 
African American Vernacular Eng-
lish as well as a tirading subreddit, 
and it has taken over internet culture 
in the form of a meme. Karen’s notori-
ous behavior is best depicted in viral 
TikTok videos, acting as a social com-
mentary towards absurd and indecent 
behavior rooted in white supremacy. 
However, the use of this meme was 
quick to receive criticism on accounts 
of sexism, racism, ageism and clas-
sism. While writer Julie Blindel went 
so far as to call the meme a “slur” that 
is “woman hating” in a tweet, oth-
ers even likened it to “the n-word for 
white women.” In the name of reverse 
racism and other baseless accusations, 
the meme continues to be attacked. 
And once again, the perfectly legiti-
mate message this politicized joke was 

meant to express was underwhelmed 
by another fruitless debate. 
The meme is simple: Karen-like 
behavior is problematic. It is problem-
atic because it is a direct result of white 
supremacist sentiments that have 
long been deeply embedded within 
the current system. It is problematic 
because when authority gets involved, 
Karen is initially never at fault and is 
never doubted. And it is problematic 
because Karen knows this when she 
picks up the phone to dial 911 at the 
slightest inconvenience. In fact, just 
this past Memorial day, a Twitter 
video went viral revealing a similar 
incident in Central Park regarding a 
white woman calling the police on an 
African-American man who simply 
asked her to put a leash on her dog, 
telling them he was threatening her 
life. These kinds of false accusations 
to the police against Black people are 
extremely dangerous and have dire 
consequences as history has revealed 
time and time again, like in the case of 
Emmett Till. But Karen won’t think 
twice before racial profiling. 
Defending any similar behavior 
is problematic — especially on the 
account of reverse racism. This fic-
tional term assumes that racism exists 
on a level playing field and that there 
exists a level of power and author-
ity the Karen meme has to affect the 
white person’s privileges. But there is 
no systemic relationship with power 
here and, if anything, excessive use of 
the joke contributes to racial prejudice 
among white women, leaving all their 
privileges intact. To liken Karen to the 
“n-word for white women” is com-
pletely inappropriate, especially when 

no word carries the same weight of 
violent, systemic racism. To use sexism 
as a victimizing justification for tak-
ing advantage of someone’s historical 
oppression is nothing short of white 
feminism, using feminism so long as 
it’s comfortable and self-rewarding and 
continues to further a white agenda. 
As commissioning editor Kuba Shand-
Baptiste suggests in her column for 
Independent, “getting to the Karen 
equals 
discrimination 
conclusion 
requires an enormous leap: Entirely 
ignoring the racist behaviours the nick-
name originally intended to personify.”
The Karen debate is not one worth 
having. Her behavior is explicit and 
wrong, and it is justifiably called out 
by internet culture. But it’s not the only 
type of conduct that is unacceptable. It’s 
easy to point out other people’s wrongs 
and to criticize their absurd behavior, 
especially when it’s trending. Subtle 
racial profiling and implicit prejudice 
may be quieter, but it is just as influen-
tial. Complicit silence is just as loud. As 
protests for the countless Black lives 
unlawfully lost to systemic racism and 
police violence continue to take over 
the streets across the country, claiming 
you are not racist is no longer sufficient. 
Our role as machines against injustice 
continues to evolve. And it’s more than 
likely that there exists a sliver of Karen 
in all of us that we must constantly keep 
in check. We must recognize our own 
entitled tendencies towards any race, 
class and gender.

Recognize your ‘Karen’

T

here is a massive mental health 
crisis brewing as COVID-19 
sweeps across our communi-
ties. While many of us are trying to fol-
low ever-changing protocols at home, 
thousands of frontline workers are 
perpetually immersed in the pandemic, 
unable to escape the constant threat 
of exposure. The number of cases and 
deaths have overwhelmed our current 
healthcare infrastructure — but the 
depth of this unpreparedness goes far 
beyond not having enough masks. 
Healthcare workers must deal with 
a high daily influx of COVID-19 cases 
coming into hospitals with composure 
while patients and families are suffer-
ing. Their workload has skyrocketed, 
alongside a constant uncertainty of 
ever-changing protocols. Burnout is 
typical in the medical field even when 
there isn’t a crisis at hand, and with the 
added stress COVID-19 and govern-
ment failures put on frontline medical 
workers, the emotional toll is going 
to be unprecedented. Since the sharp 
increase of cases in the United States in 
mid-March, these workers have had no 
time to process the emotional weight of 
the crisis, and have no time to seek psy-
chiatric support.
Facing 
continuous, 
inescapable 
stress both in the workplace and inter-
personally is having a devastating 
impact on healthcare workers. There 
are three critical psychological impacts: 
acute stress response, moral injury and 
post-traumatic stress disorder. Stress 
reactions range from physical symp-
toms like headaches to behavioral 
changes like drug and alcohol abuse. 
If these reactions are not recognized 
and confronted, feelings of guilt and 
shame can accumulate below the sur-
face. Moral injury occurs when there 
is a betrayal of what is considered right 
— during this pandemic, healthcare 
workers have to consistently go against 
their own beliefs to uphold hospital 
protocol. Healthcare workers cannot 
touch, comfort or support their patients 
in ways they used to, and they must 
act as the liaison between families and 
patients that are separated at the door. 
While no family was allowed to 
enter the room of a dying 75-year-old 
COVID-19 patient, one nurse remained 
by his side. She held his hand and moist-
ened his lips to help comfort him. Ulti-
mately, “she held an iPad close to him, 
so he could see the face and hear the 
voice of a grief-stricken relative Skyp-
ing from the hospital corridor.” After he 
passed away, she wept in the secluded 
hallway. Coping with a moral injury 
takes time that frontline workers do 
not have. Finally, the unavoidable stress 
and moral injury they experience can 
lead to PTSD, a mental health disorder 
with symptoms similar to a traumatic 
brain injury, that severely alters how 

someone experiences stress. 
When someone experiences trauma 
and does not have the social or psy-
chological support needed to process 
and manage the weight of its emo-
tional impact, they can develop coping 
mechanisms to help relieve temporary 
frustration. However, the trauma can 
ultimately rewire the brain, leaving 
the nervous system on constant high 
alert for the next stressor. The residual 
effects of suppressing the impact of 
trauma does not aid healing, but rather 
creates a cacophony of physical and psy-
chological symptoms that can be debili-
tating. PTSD is a mental health disorder 
that alters the function of the amygdala, 
which regulates emotions and stress 
responses. The hippocampus, critical 
for verbal declarative memory, is also 
highly sensitive to trauma. Addition-
ally, PTSD can permanently alter the 
medial prefrontal cortex, which helps 
regulate emotions and behavior. 
It is critical that we take the time to 
educate ourselves about PTSD, anxi-
ety disorders and the impact of trauma 
on one’s well being while the rapidly 
churning news cycle buries the threat 
of the mental health crisis. Thanking 
the medical frontline heroes for their 
tireless work is a good first step, but we 
must effectively support these workers 
by actively listening to their struggles 
and addressing the structural failures 
of psychiatric care. 
In order to appropriately address the 
crisis at hand, we must provide ongo-
ing and wide-scope care. According to 
Dr. Jessica Gold, an assistant professor 
psychiatry at Washington University 
in St. Louis, that includes “preventive 
measures (stress reduction, mindful-
ness, and educational materials), in-
the-moment measures (hotlines, crisis 
support), and treatment (telepsychiatry 
for therapy, and medication if needed).” 
As a community, we must collectively 
work to destigmatize mental illness 
and seeking treatment and choose to 
be supportive rather than dismissive. 
We need to check in and be prepared 
to actively listen to the struggles and 
traumas these workers are willing to 
share, even when it is painful. Keeping 
a strong support system is difficult dur-
ing this time of social distancing, but it 
is critical for the successful recovery of 
frontline medical workers. 
In the United States, mental ill-
ness is slowly becoming less stigma-
tized. However, the progress toward 
acknowledging and confronting mental 
illness is not urgent enough.

F

ollowing George Floyd’s kill-
ing late last month, the news 
that former police officer Derek 
Chauvin had been arrested and recently 
charged with second-degree murder was 
no doubt a positive development. Many 
prominent national figures, including 
former presidential candidate Sen. Amy 
Klobuchar, D-Minn., have seen it as a 
sign of progress and a “first step towards 
justice.” Even though many, including 
Mr. Floyd’s family, believe the charges 
to be too minor and instead favor first-
degree murder charges for the accused, 
this is a major improvement from previ-
ous cases of police brutality. For exam-
ple, a grand jury refused to even indict 
former police officer Darren Wilson for 
murder in the infamous 2014 shooting of 
Michael Brown. 
However, even if Chauvin is convicted 
of all counts and imprisoned for as long 
as possible, which is currently 40 years, 
there is no further indication that the 
senseless police violence that claimed 
the lives of not only Mr. Brown and Mr. 
Floyd, but many others, will end. In 
2017 alone, the police killed 19 unarmed 
Black men. In 2015, they killed 36 human 
beings. Delivering justice alone is not 
enough. Protesting and looting in the 
streets alone is not enough. For there to 
be real change, America’s justice system 
must enact institutional reforms, specifi-
cally reforms on how police departments 
train officers on how to treat Black 
Americans. 
In 2015, after Freddie Gray died of 
fatal spinal cord injuries that the media 
attributed to a ‘rough ride’ in a police 
van, the comedy talk show The Daily 
Show with Trevor Noah released a seg-
ment entitled “Are All Cops Racist?” 
where correspondents Jordan Klepper 
and Roy Wood Jr. interviewed multiple 
law enforcement officials and scholars 
to inquire about the source of incessant 
police violence against Black Ameri-

cans. One person they spoke to, Dr. 
Phillip Goff, University of California at 
Los Angeles Associate Professor and 
criminal justice reform expert, stood 
out in his assessment of the sources of 
police brutality by attributing the vio-
lence to “implicit biases” held by police 
officers. These implicit biases cause the 
inability for police officers to distinguish 
between Black Americans as victims, 
perpetrators or bystanders at a potential 
crime scene and the ubiquitous harmful 
stereotypes suggesting that Black people 
are more likely to engage in violence or 
crime. In other words, police officers 
are aware of the same stereotypes that, 
according to Dr. Goff, “almost all people” 
have, and may know that they are incor-
rect and morally wrong. However, being 
active in high-stress settings exacerbates 
these biases to the point where they 
become an automatic, and often deadly, 
assumption of aggression that overrides 
better judgment. 
Dr. Goff is not the only scholar to make 
this argument. An earlier study at the 
University of Colorado in 2002, where 
participating undergraduate students 
had to identify the object white and Black 
people were holding in their hands and 
then decide whether or not to shoot, 
backed Dr. Goff’s statements. University 
of Colorado researchers found that par-
ticipants shot armed Black people quicker 
and took longer intervals of time to decide 
not to shoot unarmed Black subjects. Sub-
sequent studies verified these results and 
suggested that “bias crept in when offi-
cers were subject to mental stress.” Even 
studies dating back to as early as 2001 
found that both “police officers and civil-
ians are consistently more likely to associ-
ate black faces with criminality.”

I

t seems that every time we see 
another display of police brutal-
ity, people argue about what the 
appropriate response to unprovoked 
killing should be. One man is killed, 
and a hundred people who never met 
him are quick to tell you that an eye 
for an eye makes the world go blind, 
but it’s easy to say that when you’re not 
the blind one to begin with. Riots are 
easy to write off as ill-meaning chaos if 
you don’t understand how or why they 
happen, and in a country built by riots, 
that should not be the case.
Many have made up their minds 
about the “why” — anger and poor 
morals. This reductive view of the 
Minneapolis riots isn’t a new explana-
tion, but it’s widespread to the point 
that even the mayor, Jacob Frey, claims 
the protest is no longer about protest-
ing, but violence. Instead, critics focus 
their arguments on “why not” to riot, 
citing three major reasons I’ve seen 
other than simple moral outrage: the 
destruction of a community, increase 
in crime and a lack of relevance to the 
supposed subject of protest. Here’s 
why they don’t make much sense.
The “destroying your own commu-
nity” argument is probably the most 
common in the discussion about Min-
neapolis. Fortunately for the rioters, a 
community is not a series of buildings. 
It is a population of people. This report 
showcases the economic impact of the 
1960s race riots showing a decline in 
Black-owned property values. This 
loss in property value doesn’t account 
for the leaps made in civil rights dur-
ing this decade that made life more 
liveable for said property owners. 
And, if we are to consider economic 
destruction, what are we to make of 
the white flight from cities to suburbs 
that helped create the climate for those 
riots? Certainly, the white families who 
took commerce out of cities en masse 
and left them destitute played a role in 
harming their former communities. 
The truth is that Minneapolis riot-
ers have no intention to destroy their 
own community. The buildings being 
looted are in the vein of AutoZone and 
Target, massive chains that aren’t spe-
cific to the city at all, while small local 
businesses remain intact — while they 
may have suffered some residual dam-
age — were not directly targeted. And, 
as it turns out, that particular Target 
has a long history with the Minneapo-
lis police, the very subject of the riot.
Another reason this point falls apart 
is that many rioters aren’t part of the 
community. Minnesota Gov. Tim 
Walz claims 80 percent of the riot-
ers aren’t from the area, though there 
isn’t any way to verify the steep statis-
tic; with protests happening all over 

the country right now, including here 
in Ann Arbor, it seems unlikely that 
people would need to travel far to find 
one. More likely is the presence of agent 
provocateurs, people who try to pro-
voke others to commit a crime so that 
they can be punished. Police are known 
to go undercover at protests and esca-
late things — at the 2008 Democratic 
National Convention protest, undercov-
er detectives staged an altercation with 
the police commander which resulted 
in the liberal use of pepper spray by a 
cop who wasn’t in the loop and who 
thought the commander was being 
attacked. A similar staged arrest led to 
a fight between bystanders and police 
in riot gear at the 2004 Republican 
National Convention protest. Sure 
enough, police have repeatedly incited 
unprovoked violence at the recent pro-
tests, even against who they know to be 
journalists rather than protesters.
Next, riots do not lead to more 
crime. Long-term changes in crime 
rates are more easily tied to changes in 
police behavior, and those trends aren’t 
in favor of the police. For example, 
Baltimore police noticed fewer crimes 
after one of their officers killed Fred-
die Gray and the number of shootings 
spiked drastically within the area. This 
could mean that, as the article puts it, 
Baltimore police “stopped noticing” 
crime after the murder by one of their 
own, or it could mean that their mis-
conduct caused the increase in violent 
crime; neither option is flattering. After 
a string of events starting with the death 
of Eric Garner, the New York Police 
Department staged a strike, and rather 
than seeing more crime, they saw less. 
The authors of the report pointed not 
to deterrence by police violence or a 
drop in how many crimes were report-
ed, but that “aggressively enforcing 
minor legal statutes incites more severe 
criminal acts.” In other words, an over-
bearing police department created the 
climate for violent crime — without 
them, there were fewer instances of all 
but the most severe offenses.
The final condemnation of riots 
is that they are irrelevant to protests 
because they’re either only about 
opportunistic crime or they don’t 
successfully prompt change. As the 
National Review author I cited puts it, 
“People don’t commit arson to make a 
political statement. What does burn-
ing an AutoZone even communicate 
if it could be translated into politics?” 
However, there is no form of protest 
more profound under a capitalist econ-
omy than the redistribution of goods, 
especially when unemployment rates 
are reaching close to 20 percent along-
side billionaires’ profits. Legitimate 
protesters use looted supplies to sup-

port the cause and their communities, 
like the Minneapolis protesters tak-
ing milk to help those who had been 
tear-gassed (the subsequent theft of 
expensive goods was carried out by 
people unrelated to the movement). 
On top of this, peaceful protestors are 
also among those cleaning up after 
demonstrations in their community. 
Meanwhile, police officers have been 
seen destroying the property of oth-
ers to impede protestors. The most 
pressing issue today is how capitalism 
interacts with and often jeopardizes 
human rights — of the dying poor in a 
nation with billionaires, of sweatshops 
overseas, of the pollution produced 
by mass production of goods. I can 
think of nothing more emblematic of 
the injustice at hand than juxtaposing 
those outraged by a burning AutoZone 
with those outraged by the murder of 
their neighbors.
As for success, there is no univer-
sal outcome, but as a queer American, 
I can promise you that riots against 
police were the single most effec-
tive tool for LGBTQ+ people in this 
country. If people hadn’t thrown 
bricks at cops at Stonewall the move-
ment would never have taken off; San 
Francisco drag queens who destroyed 
police cars and broke windows in 1966 
were finally granted social services 
and dignity. Martin Luther King Jr.’s 
March on Washington got laws passed 
peacefully, but the majority of Ameri-
cans disapproved of him despite his 
nonviolence, even if we like to believe 
he was successful because he “won 
hearts by conveying respectability,” as 
one civil rights activist wrote. King was 
assassinated regardless of his peaceful 
tactics, just like Black men are shot 
whether they’re unarmed, handcuffed 
or running away. The clear message 
is that protest of any kind will be met 
with violence and death; to derogate 
protesters for breaking windows bor-
ders on cruelty.
We in Michigan should be sym-
pathetic. The 1967 Detroit Riots were 
some of the biggest in American histo-
ry, and yet we forget. White protesters 
storm our capitol with guns to scream 
in the face of police — in a time where 
distance can save lives — and leave 
untouched so the same stay-at-home 
order protesters can call the unarmed 
people of Minneapolis “violent and 
unlawful” a month later. How would 
you feel if it was your brother being 
arrested on live television for doing 
his job, or your father choking under 
someone’s knee? Would you sign a 
petition, or would you riot?

On ‘Creole Giselle’, a re-
imagined classic ballet

Many ballet stories are weird. 
Swans falling in love, dolls being mis-
taken for humans and the Christmas-
time obsession with a nut-cracking 
device all pass as normal. We accept 
their quirks because their music 
and choreography are about more 
than their stories. Adolphe Adam’s 
“Giselle” is different. “Giselle” has 
an awesome story. Arthur Mitchell 
might have known this more than 
anyone. 
Albrecht is a womanizing prince 
who pretends to love Giselle, a peas-
ant, while he is actually engaged to 
be married. When she learns of his 
trickery she dies of heartbreak and 
swiftly joins an army of female ghosts, 
here called willis, dedicated to the 
destruction of all men who cross their 
path. When Albrecht comes looking 
for Giselle’s grave (a little too late, 
don’t you think?), the kingdom of 
female afterlife forces him to dance 
until his own death — it’s a delicious 
ending to a beautiful show. Originally 
premiered in Paris in 1841, the ballet 
enjoyed immediate success, eventu-
ally travelling across Europe and into 
America in 1846. 
The show is easily one of the most-
performed productions in ballet 
today, but it’s also quite symbolic of 
a racially oppressive past. The willis 
dance in white dresses that match a 
historically white skin uniform that 
excluded any dancers of color long 
past its 19th century premiere. 
Arthur Mitchell’s “Giselle” is dif-
ferent. First created in 1984 for his 
all-black company Dance Theatre of 

Harlem, the production eventually 
won a Laurence Olivier Award for its 
ingenious handling of history, ballet 
and American art. Mitchell enlisted 
Frederic Franklin to restage the clas-
sic story using his cast of all-black 
dancers. Franklin abandoned the 
show’s original Rhineland setting and 
moved his production to the Ameri-
can South on a farm in Louisiana. He 
kept the choreography true to the 
1841 original and maintained Adolphe 
Adam’s masterful music. They named 
their new show “Creole Giselle.” 
This past weekend, DTH streamed 
a 1987 recording of “Creole Giselle” 
on YouTube. The New York Times 
named the show one of “Six things 
to do at home this weekend,” and the 
recording accrued over 7,000 views in 
one day. Though blurry and at times 
darkly lit, the show boasted crisp 
technique from its dancers and its 
refreshing design shone as an artistic 
tour de force. 
Watching the video, I wondered: 
Why haven’t more companies taken 
Mitchell as an example for them-
selves? Marketing departments often 
complain of audiences who feel dis-
connected from classical ballet sto-
ries — what do we have in common 
with a German peasant, a Russian 
swan or a lifelike dancing doll? These 
feelings of separation can be even 
greater for people of color who have 
been excluded from such shows on 
the basis of historically white casting 
and in some ballets, problematic por-
trayals of Eastern cultures. Mitchell 
knew this because he and his dancers 
had lived it, but he did not allow the 
outer image of “Giselle” to push him 
away. Stripped of costumes and cast-

ing choices, every ballet to have sur-
vived so many years tells omnipresent 
stories of love and loss. Often referred 
to as the Hamlet of ballet, “Giselle”’s 
dazzling music and dreamy dancing 
sets a golden standard of such emo-
tions, and there is power and inten-
tion in DTH’s choice to perform the 
work in full: Black dancers, and all 
dancers of color, are equally able to 
display the universal facets of the 
human condition that “Giselle” and 
every one of its 19th century coun-
terparts explore. Such themes do not 
belong to one era or one people, yet 
their current packaging can some-
times make it seem to be so. 
What’s stopping other major bal-
let companies from reconsidering 
their 19th century reproductions? 
Could “Swan Lake” happen on the 
shores of Lake Michigan? Wouldn’t 
“Le Corsaire” work well on a Navy 
ship? Perhaps “Coppelia”’s doll fac-
tory could be set in industrial-age 
America. More recently than Mitch-
ell, “Final Bow for Yellowface” author 
Phil Chan told Megan Fairchild in an 
interview in May that he’s been work-
ing on a new version of “La Bayadere” 
set in 1930s Hollywood rather than 
an ill-represented India. The new 
approach, Chan said, “makes that 
story about us instead of them. When 
Mitchell moved DTH’s “Giselle” to 
the Antebellum South in 1984, he was 
doing just that: Through a simple set 
change, his show could tell the stories 
that belonged to his dancers and not 
the all-white group from 150 years 
prior.

‘Girl, Serpent, 
Thorn’ is fresh 

A sign of a compelling book is the 
inability to look away from the page. 
When reading Melissa Bashardoust’s 
“Girl, Serpent, Thorn,” my nose stayed 
glued to the e-book screen. Despite the 
questionable pacing and unfulfilled 
storylines, I chugged her book down 
like a gloriously cold bottle of water on 
a scorching summer day.
I was immersed in Melissa Bashar-
doust’s fictionalized Persian empire. 
Her mythic world documents sprawl-
ing palaces, dangerous ladies and 
looming demonic forces. In that vast 
world, a young princess, Soraya, is 
isolated from the rest of the popula-
tion. Her poisonous touch makes her a 
threat to the kingdom. While her twin 
brother rules the realm, she is touch-
starved and relegated to her bedroom, 
and can only travel 
through the palace’s 
secret 
passageways. 
To change her fate, 
she is tempted by 
the mythic demons 
whose 
power 
she 
has been gifted. That 
temptation leads her 
and her kingdom to 
their destruction and 
ultimate resolution.
Soraya stands for every reader 
unaware of their potential and power. 
She is a poster child for internalized 
self-loathing but lacks the vocabu-
lary to identify her insecurities. She’s 
lonely and afraid of her own abilities. 
She wants friends but fears for their 
safety. She fundamentally wants some 
permanence in a world determined to 
obscure and deny her existence. Very 
few novels represent internalized self-
loathing and confusion as clearly as 
Bashardoust’s. 
Bashardoust’s ancient Persian set-
ting functions more as a vague aesthet-
ic stage for magical plot devices than 
as an immersive world. Bashardoust’s 
primary focus is her character-driven 
drama. There is very little within the 
novel grounded in history. Further-
more, the broader war between Sora-
ya’s civilization and the demonic 
forces that plague them goes unex-
plored and unquestioned. The greater 
in-world conflict is a watery backdrop 
for Soraya’s struggle to identify her 
wants within a cacophony of conflict-

ing opinions and expectations.
Though “Girl, Serpent, Thorn” is 
not compelling in setting, its strengths 
lie in its willingness to focus on indi-
vidual autonomy. In many respects, 
Bashardoust’s protagonist is atypical. 
Soraya’s backstory and actions code 
her as an antihero but while she ques-
tions morality, her greatest sin is out 
of her power. She’s too powerful and 
influential to make childish mistakes. 
Soraya does not mean harm but all 
her actions have consequences. While 
confused and hurting, Soraya cripples 
her kingdom’s defenses, allowing a 
hoard of demons to overtake the land. 
Soraya’s mistakes and selfish desire 
sets her apart from others in the YA lit-
erary canon. Bashardoust allows Sora-
ya to impart devastating destruction 
on those around her, then forces her to 
clean up her mess. But despite her self-
ishness, you can’t help but empathize 
with her character. Soraya has not 
only been deprived 
of human company 
but also the ability to 
make mistakes. That 
tragedy drives Sora-
ya’s desire for restitu-
tion and foretells her 
kingdom’s doom.
Soraya’s 
atypical 
character 
construc-
tion is one example 
of how Bashardoust’s novel plays Rus-
sian roulette with expectations. Vet-
eran YA readers are trained to pick up 
on genre tropes and plotlines. Soraya 
has two love interests. Early hints 
flag each character as a contender 
for her heart. But unlike other YA 
novels, ultimately neither love inter-
est is fighting for Soraya’s heart. They 
are vying to influence her worldview 
and self-perception. Through min-
ute framing differences, Bashardoust 
flaunts romantic expectations while 
never straying beyond the bounds of 
YA convention. Her novel features the 
YA hallmarks, such as: The powerful 
magic woman who doesn’t know she’s 
special, dark and mysterious boys and 
looming existential threats. However, 
the novel does not attempt to sub-
vert the genre conventions. Instead, 
Bashardoust rearranges the tropes 
by compressing the novel’s timeline. 
Common YA tropes act as temporary 
red herrings for seasoned readers.

BOOK REVIEW
BOOK REVIEW


Pop culture would have us believe that the 
Venn diagram between sports fans and art nerds 
is more or less two separate circles. As a humble 
representative of the tiny sliver in the middle, 
I want to introduce my friends on both sides to 
the world of their culturally prescribed adver-
sary. There are some similarities between the 
two that few would expect to find — similarities 
that, I argue, allow us to view sport as art. Let’s 
set the scene. Our protagonist is NFL analyst 
Adam Schefter, who stakes his reputation on his 
straight-shooter, no-nonsense reporting. Scheft-
er’s Twitter feed is the Associated Press of the 
NFL world; if he says something, it’s true. A few 
weeks ago, Schefter put on his best suit, set up his 
webcam in front of his well-stocked bookcase, 
and joined an ESPN broadcast held over Zoom, 
complete with all the aggressive rock music, 
flashy graphics and artificial urgency we’ve 
come to expect from the network. The occasion? 
The announcement of the order in which next 
season’s NFL games will be played in.
One might think the order of games isn’t par-
ticularly interesting news, perhaps worthy of a 
short segment highlighting interesting match-
ups, but ESPN had other thoughts. They instead 
hosted a three-hour show breaking down each 
team’s schedule with such pressing commentary 
as “X team won’t be able to handle so many games 
in cold cities in December,” or, “Y rookie quarter-
back will be demoralized by difficult opponents 
early on.” This was stated with a baffling level 
of confidence, despite being months away from 
a season whose fate is already uncertain due to 
the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, Schefter 
desperately tries to do the impossible and fill the 
home stretch of this painfully long production 
with anything resembling objective analysis.
How did Schefter find himself in this posi-
tion? The ESPN show is an extreme example of 
the increasing role of narrative in professional 
sports. A three-hour show for a schedule release 
is a bit excessive, but the stories that the media 
constructs around games are a large part of what 
makes them so exciting. Each NFL team plays 
16 regular-season games. Though the average 
broadcast is over three hours long, the ball is only 
in play for about 11 minutes per game. To make 
these short bursts of action feel consequential, 
the media sets up elaborate storylines in the 
hours and days leading up to games. They do so 
by creating characters out of athletes and fram-
ing games such that they follow a traditional nar-
rative arc, putting their characters in situations 
where they have to overcome obstacles larger 
than the game itself. The week one matchup 
between the Saints and the Buccaneers, for 
instance, becomes not just a potentially good 
game, but a battle between veterans Drew Brees 
and Tom Brady to solidify their legacy as the best 

quarterback in the league and to push the limits 
of how many years they can play at a high level. 
Analysts will routinely praise the determination 
and perseverance required of Brees and Brady to 
play through their 40s. 
Each play thus carries far more weight, as it’s 
not just the game on the line, but also a whole 
host of abstract values and principles. In this 
light, analysts can be considered analogous to 
storytellers — more so than regular journalists, 
as they add far more narrative to their subject 
matter than a reporter covering a “real” news 
story. That is to say, the difference between the 
actual events and their portrayal in the media 
is greater in sports journalism than it is in other 
branches of journalism. Athletes are, in a sense, 
analogous to performers, coaches to directors, 
referees to stage managers and so on. The result 
is a coherent “show” so to speak, a circular sys-
tem consisting of the game and the media’s 
commentary about the game. The tendency to 
narrativize games can be found in other sports, 
but the NFL and its media apparatus have used 
these techniques the most. It pays off for them 
too. The NFL has for some time been the most 
watched sports league in the United States. One 
might argue that this phenomenon is just a way 
to sensationalize the game and increase profits. 
Though I’m inclined to agree, the narrativization 
of sport has nonetheless created the conditions 
by which sport can — and I think should — be 
considered art. 
Coinciding with the rise of narrativized 
sport, we’ve seen athletes and sports journalists 
broaden the scope of the issues that they’re will-
ing to discuss. Whereas sports media in the past 
generally had a narrow focus on the sport itself 
(e.g. play-by-play recaps, statistics, trade and con-
tract negotiations, etc.), it now doesn’t shy away 
players’ personalities, drama and even broader 
social issues that don’t directly relate to sports. 
This is mostly an organic process, without any 
motivation outside of generating more content 
for its own sake. People in sports media are prob-
ably not intentionally making sport like art, and 
if they are, it is only for the practical concern of 
making games more entertaining. There are, 
however, real stakes to these conversations.
Sports media, especially NFL media, often 
uses rhetoric that praises athletes’ toughness, 
determination, grit and other similar attributes. 
This traditionally masculine rhetoric is often 
channelled to destructive ends. Athletes’ tough-
ness is used to justify and downplay the serious 
health risks associated with playing a contact 
sport like football. Countless football players 
have suffered from CTE, and though the NFL 
has made some small gestures to player safety, 
the problem remains largely unaddressed. Vio-
lence by athletes is routinely swept under the 
rug. Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, for 
example, was accused of sexual assault twice in 
2010. One case ended in a settlement and another

was dropped by the accuser while stressing that 
she was not recanting her story. Roethlisberger 
received only a six-week suspension and no jail 
time, and he still plays for the Steelers to this day. 
These are just a few of the ways that the cultural 
and political conflicts of the world are reflected 
in sport. These issues pertain mostly to football, 
but there are undoubtedly problems that other 
sports leagues need to reckon with, like the 
racism against black athletes in European soc-
cer leagues, or the pay gap between male and 
female athletes. Most players and sports journal-
ists see themselves as passive observers of these 
issues with no recourse in the face of the large 
enterprises that are the sports leagues and news 
organizations. This serves to only strengthen the 
apathy of people involved in the sports world, 
preventing any grassroots corrective measures 
outside of the minor reforms from above. 
One attempt to solve a serious issue in the con-
text of sport is Colin Kaepernick’s peaceful pro-
test against police brutality in 2016. Many argued 
that Kaepernick kneeling during the national 
anthem was somehow disrespecting the flag 
and the troops, despite getting the suggestion to 
kneel from a military veteran. These arguments 
were clearly weak at the time, and are even more 
ridiculous in the context of the ongoing protests 
in response to the murder of George Floyd, yet 
they still persist. Saints quarterback Drew Brees 
came under fire just last week for saying that he 
would “never agree with anybody disrespect-
ing the flag of the United States of America” in 
a conversation about the current protests and 
Kaepernick’s anthem protest. This prompted 
impassioned responses from journalists, athletes 
and even Brees’s own teammates condemning 
his stance. Conversations like these could have 
never taken in sports media of the past. Coverage 
of player personalities and the drama of the day 
has unintentionally paved the way for the seri-
ous conversations athletes and sports journalists 
are increasingly having. Kaepernick and his sup-
porters had a sense of pride in themselves and 
their values that outweighed the pressure from 
their institutions to conform to the status quo. 
We can see that the increasingly artistic qualities 
of sport have, in a limited sense, enabled athletes 
to be more outspoken and to feel a sense of agen-
cy over themselves. Does this mean that sports 
are, in fact, art?
I won’t try to identify an essential quality to 
art and shoehorn sport into a vague definition 
or sneak it in on an obscure technicality (though 
vague, obscure and technical rules are certainly 
on brand for football). Instead I’ll go the other 
direction, and suggest that there is value in view-
ing sport as art regardless of whether it fits some 
prescriptive definition. Contentious debates 
around what is and isn’t art are common among 
art critics. Art critic David Novitz discusses this 
issue in his article “Disputes about Art,” pub-
lished in the Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criti-
cism. He focuses on pieces that are seen as test 
cases in the art world, pieces that incite particu-
larly heated debate, like “Fountain” by Marcel 
Duchamp, an ordinary porcelain urinal submit-
ted for an exhibition with the intent of mock-
ing the superficiality of European high culture 
post-WWI. When it comes to more subversive or 
unconventional pieces, the debates around their 
validity as art have less to do with particular 

ways we decide to define art (e.g. essentialism, 
functionalism, artist’s intent, etc.), but rather 
are “part of a larger dispute about whose values 
and beliefs are worthy of serious attention, and 
whose cultural interests should prevail in a given 
society,” according to Novitz. 
Novitz suggests that by considering an object 
art, we grant it a certain kind of privilege. The 
status of art functions as a legitimizing force that 
works in two directions. On one hand, traditional 
and established pieces and art forms reinforce 
the existing set of cultural values. On the other, 
subversive pieces and forms that are successful 
in attaining artistic status can grant legitimacy 
to ideas and values that have previously been 
marginalized. People who make or talk about 
art are generally aware of this tension in one way 
or another. It is common among artists to have 
conversations about how a given piece subverts 
or conforms to standards, and what implications 
that has on art and culture. Artists themselves 
are often keenly aware of the cultural work that 
their art performs and make this an explicit 
focus of their pieces. 
A common refrain from Kaepernick’s critics is 
that politics don’t belong in sports, that sports are 
a place where we can relax and tune out from the 
world. This attitude is clearly harmful to people 
like Kaepernick who are politically active and 
don’t have much power compared to the NFL 
as an institution. It prevents people involved in 
sports from being critical of either sports institu-
tions or broader society. Narrativized sport has 
empowered athletes and journalists to be vocal 
about these issues and many have taken advan-
tage of it. This is where art comes in: If athletes 
and journalists internalize their roles as per-
formers and storytellers respectively, they can 
claim a certain agency. In the same way artists’ 
values are reflected in their art, what if athletes 
and journalists saw themselves as reflecting the 
same values in their dedication to their sport as 
they do when speaking out against injustice? In 
the same way an artist who sells out, panders 
or otherwise compromises their values isn’t 
taken seriously, what if an athlete or journal-
ist who maintains the integrity of their values 
both on and off the field is commended? An 
artistic approach to sport humanizes athletes 
by encouraging them to untether themselves 
from the interests of those in power. It allows 
those involved in sport to be active participants 
in shaping the structures that they are a part of, 
so that fixing issues like CTE and violence among 
athletes becomes within the scope of the average 
athlete or journalist and not left at the mercy of 
faceless institutions. This reorientation will have 
to come from the ground up. Athletes and jour-
nalists must be willing to break from the views of 
owners, leagues and news networks and be vocal 
critics of the world around them. Perhaps if we 
consider sports art — and athletes and journal-
ists artists — they can grant themselves a sense 
of legitimacy that hasn’t been afforded to them 
by the “keep politics out of sports” crowd. At the 
very least we can recognize that sports’ increas-
ing similarities to art has empowered athletes 
and journalists. And if an artistic ethos can be 
beneficial to those in the sports world, maybe the 
rest of us can see where in our own lives we can 
be artists, where we can see ourselves as legiti-
mate and empowered actors.

Mass incarceration and Black 
American health

The criminal justice system is 
one of the chief systems affect-
ing Black American health. The 
country’s prison system and over-
policing strategy is not just a way 
to keep criminals off the streets, it 
is a large, for-profit institution that 
gains strength by perpetuating an 
endless cycle that is almost impos-
sible to break. The prison industrial 
complex of this country is particu-
larly compelling as a challenge to 
Black American wellness because 
it so disproportionately and inten-
tionally affects Black people above 
any other group. Especially now, 
as there is a nationwide push to 
abolish the police, it is crucial to 
understand why police brutal-
ity and racism are public health 
issues. Because the U.S. incarcer-
ates many more of its citizens than 
other 
developed 
democracies, 
many researchers have cited it as 
partly responsible for the widening 
gap between health of the U.S. and 
other countries.
The ratio of white to Black 
imprisonment rates is 1 to 7, largely 
a result of the War on Drugs and its 
targeting of young, disadvantaged, 
inner-city members of minority 
groups. Michael Tonry and Mat-
thew Melewski highlight the role 
of racist crime control policies on 
subjugating Black Americans in 
their article, stating that had incar-
ceration rates remained at 1970 
levels (around 130 per 100,000) 
or at 1980 levels around 200 per 
100,000], “fewer black men would 
have suffered the pains of impris-

onment, resulting stigma, and 
reduced employment prospects,” 
and there would be “many fewer 
broken black families, fewer nega-
tive role models for black boys, 
more marriageable black men,” 
and “less deterioration in poor 
black communities.” The prison 
industrial complex can be seen as 
an extension of the plantation and 
acts of racial violence, fostering 
normalization of violence against 
Black bodies, inhumane servitude 
and normalization of Black deaths 
.These are only a few of the effects 
of mass incarceration on Black peo-
ple, Black men and boys in particu-
lar. While other young men are out 
building their futures, Black men 
are at odds with a racist system.
Prisons do not only affect the 
individual, but families and com-
munities as a whole. Aside from 
obvious health barriers includ-
ing lack of proper food, hygiene, 
health care and the fact that pris-
ons and jails are overcrowded with 
people in poor health receiving 
inadequate care, being in such an 
environment has the capacity to 
breed extreme and irreversible 
psychological damage. Nearly one 
in three Black men will be impris-
oned in their life, and nearly half of 

Black women have an immediate or 
extended family member in prison. 
Research has found very harm-
ful effects on physical and mental 
health of inmates after release, as 
well as negative health impacts on 
the partners and children of incar-
cerated men. Incarceration con-
tributes to familial and community 
fractures and gives no opportunity 
for rehabilitation. Furthermore, 
prominent health disparities faced 
by Black Americans, including HIV 
risk and preterm birth/maternal 
health problems, can be linked to 
mass incarceration, highlighting 
not only the intersectionality but 
also the pervasiveness of the issue. 
A study on mass incarceration and 
public health revealed a signifi-
cant positive association between 
Louisiana jails’ Black individu-
als incarcerated and estimated 
risk of preterm birth, suggesting 
that mass incarceration may be an 
underlying factor of the inequities 
in reproductive health outcomes of 
Black women in Louisiana. 
In order to address the health 
issues plaguing Black Americans 
both inside prison and as a catalytic 
effect of it...

The undocumented, 
incarcerated and homeless

A new moment in history is 
being lived in every community, 
within every country; unlimited 
to any age, race, socioeconomic 
class or sex. It has canceled music 
festivals and rallies, graduations 
and weddings, a fun taco Tuesday 
with friends or our beloved Skeeps 
Saturdays. Within the blink of an 
eye, life as we knew it was turned 
upside down. Everything that made 
months and years feel like seconds 
disappeared, and space and time 
have never felt slower. Throughout 
the semester, prior understand-
ings of community, space, time 
and history have been challenged 
and unveiled, having various layers 
and dimensions. Particularly with 
time/history, years like 1991 have 
become more than just a date. 1991 
symbolized the new wave of Black 
migration, the precursor to many of 
the “hot summer riots,” the death 
of Latasha Harlins and beating of 
Rodney King, as well as the release 
of A Tribe Called Quest’s second 
album: “The Low End Theory.” 
Multiple layers come with each 
year and at times, what is realized 
is that these layers not only reveal 
multidimensional 
plotlines, 
but 
could, potentially, serve as a means 
of distraction from what is inher-
ently at risk and threatened. 
COVID-19 serves as a distrac-
tion from the U.S.’s perception and 
categorization of race and opportu-
nity. As universal as this virus has 
been broadcasted to be, there is an 
inherent racial disparity at play, 
particularly seen within big cities

and places of wealth gaps. The two 
cities that may help to best under-
stand the relationship between 
the virus and racial categorization 
amongst the data are San Francis-
co and Seattle who were hit early 
on by the virus and continue to be 
affected and drastically changed 
by its presence. Through the analy-
sis of the various measures taken 
within these two cities, the percep-
tion of the virus as a universal phe-
nomenon may dissipate and instead 
demonstrate another event in time 
that has been taken as an opportu-
nity to disempower marginalized 
communities and disguise biases 
against the same demographics. 
There are two moments of urban 
crisis that have been acknowl-
edged. The first in the late 60s, fol-
lowing the civil rights movement 
and joining alongside the Black 
power movement. The second was 
during the early 90s with the emer-
gence of riots and political unrest 
amongst marginalized communi-
ties, particularly that of the Black 
community. Currently, there seems 
to be another period of urban crisis 
that some may say is a continua-
tion from that of the 90s, but may 
also be seen as something new. As 
time has progressed, marginalized 
communities have gotten better at 
adjusting to what society “offers” 
and extracting what they can from 
it. In the 60s, it was rights, liberties 
and more opportunity in the North 
and West, thus the reason why 
many families migrated across the 
country.

Why is it they resent my dark

From Till to Floyd
And the hundreds in between

Another statistic in the book,

Another innocent life wrong-

Then we grieve, the pain fades
And we play the waiting game

I’m disappointed we pride

that our families believed would

what feels like no support from

has a history of privileging “white-

are dismissed until we begin to 
disturb the “peace” this University

Black Lives Matter is a peaceful organiza-
tion — created after the killing of Trayvon 
Martin in 2013 — that fights to support Black 
innovation and excellence and combat acts 
of violence, which are the result of systemic 
racism. While the recent protests are cer-
tainly sparked by George Floyd’s killing, this 
is not what the fight is about nor does it end 
with the conviction of his killers — Derek 
Chauvin, Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Keung 
and Tou Thao. And Black Lives Matter 
doesn’t end with Breonna Taylor or Ahmaud 
Arbery either. Activists are seeking a disrup-
tion of the system that has been working to 
appease the white supremacist narrative 
and society. Black Lives Matter is seeking 
freedom, an end to police brutality and the 
inequalities in the justice system, brought 
about by the violence against Black people on 
the basis of their skin color. 
According to a study conducted by the 
Proceedings of the National Academy of the 
Sciences of the USA, Black men and women 
are 2.5 and 1.4 times respectively more likely 
to be killed by police over the course of their 
life than white men and women. Addition-
ally, several white police officers and white 
perpetrators, in general, have gotten away 
with killing black men and women despite 
the existence of evidence that could con-
vict them. For example, Philando Castile 
was killed at a traffic stop and his killer 
was caught on tape, and instead of his killer 
being convicted, the city paid Castile’s fam-
ily a large settlement. Terence Crutcher was 
experiencing car trouble, and officer Betty 
Shelby said she shot him because she “feared 
for her life.” A video showed he had his hands 
in the air and made no threats towards her. 
Tamir Rice was playing with a toy gun when 
an officer shot him for allegedly pointing his 
pistol at people. The officer was simply fired. 
The Black Lives Matter movement is a peace-
ful and legal movement, currently pushing 
for change in our policy about excessive use 

Protesting racism: A 
first-person perspective

AAKASH RAY
MiC Staff Writer

Provided by Aakash Ray

With the Black Lives Matter movement 
gaining momentum in the last couple weeks, 
it has become routine to wake up to social 
media feeds brimming with infographics on 
“the history of racism in America,” “defund-
ing the police” and other ways to support the 
cause. We scroll away on our phones, reading 
relevant articles and casually sharing sensa-
tional stories of police brutality as regularly 
as we once broadcasted our weekends at the 
lake. What was once the outcry from primar-
ily Black Americans has transformed into 
a nationwide pursuit for systematic racial 
justice. Yet, as with any movement, I predict 
media attention will subside, people will stop 
posting and other news will take greater pre-
cedence.
The backdrop of “quarantine life” present 
within our daily lives, has left people with 
the easy excuse to digress from in-person 
activism. Reading experiences from behind 
a screen and having conversations within 
the comfort of our homes is far less engag-
ing than hearing the voices of those in pain 
amplified in person. I decided to attend a 
protest in Detroit this past weekend to empa-
thize, to grieve and to fight alongside Black 
Americans.
As a non-Black POC, I have always shied 
away from discussing anti-Blackness within 
my own South Asian community. As an indi-
vidual with few Black friends, it has been dif-
ficult for me to confront the racial prejudices 
within my own social circles and feel confi-
dent that I was being the best ally that I could 
be. Trying to overcome this doubt, I felt a pit 
in my stomach as I traveled to Detroit know-
ing this will be the first time I face this dis-
comfort in-person. 
Arriving at Eastern Market, I felt the thick 
heat in the air as I positioned my mask. I felt 
a bit disoriented and lost at first not know-
ing where to begin. I was met with hundreds 

of other individuals ready to march down to 
the riverfront, carrying all types of signs, 
from “Black Lives Matter” posters to ones 
donned with the names of dozens of Black 
Americans who died at the hands of police 
brutality. One sign in particular relayed the 
words of human rights activist Malcolm X 
who said, “I don’t see an American dream; I 
see an American nightmare.”
As the words circled in my head, I was 
overcome with deep sadness. Why is it that 
thousands needed to gather together to 
prove ending racism isn’t controversial? Why 
must it take outcries from across the world 
for the systems in power to pay attention? Is 
there any American dream at all for margin-
alized communities in this nation?
With these thoughts lingering in my 
mind, we slowly began to march. Initially, 
we walked in silence and spread out far 
apart from others; however, as time went 
on, we began to draw closer together. With 
this cohesion came synchronization, and the 
once muffled chanting became strong and 
melodic. 
“No justice” was quickly followed by a 
powerful punch, “no peace.”
“Hands up!” “Don’t shoot”
“Say their names?” “Which one?”
The sun was beating down and I could 
feel my voice being strained from chanting 
through my mask for hours. Sweat had begun 
to drip down the side of my face along with 
tears, racing towards the sides of my mouth 
where I could taste a faint saltiness. The 
efforts were largely led by Black Americans 
whose voices echoed the pain and injustice 
of the past 400 years — reminding myself 
and other protestors to continue pushing 
through the heat and fatigue. Alongside the 
pathway, volunteers of all ages, including 
young boys and girls, hung “BLM” signs off 
the side of their coolers as they lugged...

of force in law enforcement on the basis of 
race. This also points to outrage over the 
overcriminalization of Black people and the 
decriminalization of caucasian people by the 
justice system, as according to the United 
States Sentencing Commission, “Black male 
offenders received sentences on average 
19.1 percent longer than similarly situated 
White male offenders.” Additionally, a study 
conducted by the Sentencing Project shows 
how implicit bias has led people to associate 
criminality with Black and Hispanic people. 
We want to express how we, as South 
Asian Americans, can help, because being 
South Asian or any other NBPOC [COPY: 
maybe spell out] is not an excuse to dismiss 
this discussion. We, as a community, benefit 
from this oppression and if we do not inform 
ourselves and our peers to create change, we 
remain a perpetrator of the problem. Being 
brown can sometimes feel like a get out of jail 
free card — I’m not white, I’m brown, how 
could I be racist to black people? You’d be 
surprised; a lot of this is due to the “model 
minority” myth. 
For those who are unfamiliar, the “model 
minority” myth is the idea that certain POC 
groups (like East Asian and South Asian 
Americans) are the ideal immigrant group. 
If you have parents with the immigrant suc-
cess story, you’ve probably heard the age-old 
tale: “We came to America with so little, we 
worked hard, climbed the ladders, ignored 
discrimination and are now well-off in the 
land of dreams.” But some who tell this tale 
do so by putting down other POC: “If I did it, 
why can’t they?” 
The success of minority groups in Ameri-
ca is largely a result of Black activism in the 
1960s, but also the stark difference in treat-
ment in this country in the modern day. Yes, 
Asian Americans and South Asian Ameri-
cans have faced horrible discrimination in 
this country — the Chinese Exclusion Act, 
internment camps and the fears of...

‘We were going to win a national championship. That’s what we were 
gonna do’: An oral history of the 2005 Michigan softball championship

The Michigan softball team 
was tired of simply making it. 
Entering 2005, the program 
had been to the Women’s College 
World Series seven times in 
the last 10 seasons, yet never 
finished above fifth place. In a 
West 
Coast-dominated 
sport, 
the 
Midwestern 
Wolverines 
were viewed as a respected 
competitor, not a viable threat to 
win the championship.
From the very beginning, the 
2005 team set out to change that 
perception. Undeterred by the 
burden of a No. 1 ranking, slight 
from the national media and bouts 
with the brink of elimination, 
the Wolverines proved they were 
more than competitors. They 
were champions. 
“It was Michigan softball’s 
moment,” Jessica Merchant, a 
2005 senior shortstop and team 
captain, said. “And it was just an 
exciting moment for Michigan 
softball to be able to finally get to 
the top.”
Fifteen years later, the team’s 
remarkable victory continues to 
be felt in the confines of Alumni 
Field and across the softball 
landscape. The Daily spoke with 
players and coaches to reminisce 
on the legendary season. 
Michigan 
began 
the 
2005 
season ranked eighth nationally, 
pairing an auspicious freshman 
class with a core nucleus of players 
returning from a 2004 trip to the 
Women’s College World Series. 
Early on, it was apparent that 
last year’s letdown in Oklahoma 
City hung over the team — the 
Wolverines fell to LSU, 3-2, in 13 
innings and then to Stanford, 5-4, 
to close their season.
Merchant: Every year we 
had a goal setting activity. We 
talked about what goals we’re 
gonna set for ourselves as a team 
throughout the year.
Stephanie Bercaw, Michigan 
outfielder, 2003-2006: Every 
year, it was always “Let’s make 
it to the World Series.” For that 
year, that came up again, and 
there was a big debate on why 
we keep saying “Make it” to the 
World Series.

Tiffany 
Haas, 
Michigan 
second baseman, 2003-2006: 
(Merchant) stood up and she 
was loud and said, “I want to win 
this. This is what I want.” She 
just made a decision, 
said it out loud, and from that 
moment, we all bought in.
Bonnie 
Tholl, 
Michigan 
associate head coach, 1994-
2020: Someone in the room 
needed to say it, and Jessie 
Merchant had enough courage 
to say it.
Jennie 
Ritter, 
Michigan 
pitcher, 
2003-2006: 
When 
it was finally said, (Michigan 
coach Carol Hutchins) was just 
like, “Okay, let’s do it.” It was 
so matter of fact. If that’s what 
we’re gonna do then let’s do it. 
It was more of a mission than a 
lofty goal.
It didn’t take long for Michigan 
to hit its first bump in the road — 
a season-opening 7-6 loss to No. 
17 Baylor. 
Ritter: We lost that first 
game, it was like what the heck 
are we doing? Then we went on 
the win streak.
Rebekah Milian, Michigan 
outfielder, 2004-2007: We just 
kept knocking teams off. And 
we just sort of knew. We lost our 
first game and after that, we just 
never lost.
Michigan rode a 21-game win 
streak into the opening game of the 
Judi Garman Classic in Fullerton, 
California (March 17 - March 20). 
Ranked fifth in the country, the 
Wolverines had already toppled 
eight ranked opponents on the 
season, yet matchups with No. 11 
Texas and No. 1 Arizona loomed. 
Tholl: 
The 
Judi 
Garman 
tournament was typically a mini 
Women’s College World Series 
with the caliber of teams that 
were entered in that tournament 
year in and year out.
Grace 
Leutele, 
Michigan 
third 
baseman, 
2003-2006: 
You either survive or die that 
weekend in my opinion — you 
either win them all or lose them 
all. 
Carol Hutchins, Michigan 
head coach, 1985-2020: We beat 
Arizona in the finals.

Leutele: It proved to us that 
what we already knew to be true 
was true. That we were capable 
of beating anybody. 
Nicole Motycka, Michigan 
designated player, 2002-2005: 
And it gave us the confidence 
a national championship team 
needs to win. A lot of teams 
are really talented, but I think 
it takes a certain level of that 
confidence.
Hutchins: They didn’t care if 
I believed in them or not. They 
had an innate swag that, as many 
good teams as I’ve had, I have 
never had a team with that kind 
of internal belief.
Hutchins: So we got back and 
somebody said you’re probably 
gonna be ranked number one, 
and I was like “Oh, greeeeat.” 
Because you know, I know as 
well as anyone, I’m trying to 
get back to the World Series and 
have a chance to win it, but just 
to get to it, how hard it is. 
Samantha 
Findlay, 
Michigan first baseman, 2005-
2008: All I have drilled in my 
head still is “We’re gonna play 
one-pitch softball, we’re gonna 
play one game at a time until we 
get to the World Series until we 
win the national championship.”
Merchant: 
Hutch 
sent 
a 
message loud and clear that 
nobody cares who’s number one 
in the middle of the season and 
that all that matters is who’s 
number one at the end.
Hutchins: The team wasn’t 
rattled by it. We just did a really 
good job. Those kids had been to 
the World Series and had their 
heart broken. They knew that 
this wasn’t over until the end.
Merchant: I think it was a 
stepping stone for us. Maybe not 
to ourselves so much, but to the 
rest of the country that we were 
here to compete with the best.
Michigan 
breezed 
into 
Big 
Ten play on a school-record 
32-game-winning streak, setting 
up a much-anticipated home 
opener against No. 24 Iowa. 
The 
Hawkeyes 
shocked 
the 
Wolverines, 5-2. 
Becky 
Marx, 
Michigan 
catcher, 2005-2006: We just 
had this expectation that we 
were going to blow through 
everyone. That made us regroup 
a little.

Tholl: It turned out to be 
the very best thing that could 
have happened to us because we 
weren’t afraid of losing anymore.
Motycka: The losses that we 
experienced kind of humbled us 
to reset and focus on what was 
important. Because I think that 
we knew that we could do it, we 
just had to maintain composure.
Hutchins: In the entire Big 
Ten season until the last day 
we were number two in the Big 
Ten. Northwestern had a one 
game lead on us all year. And you 
know what? Our kids still valued 
winning the Big Ten season, 
probably more than I did. 
Merchant: 
We 
needed 
Michigan 
State 
to 
beat 
Northwestern to give us a shot 
the next weekend, so a lot of 
things fell into place.
Hutchins: They only had to 
beat us once, we had to beat them 
twice.
Michigan 
State 
edged 
out 
Northwestern, 
creating 
a 
dramatic 
final 
weekend 
of 
the Big Ten season between 
Michigan (13-2 Big Ten) and the 
Wildcats (15-1 Big Ten). Buoyed 
by a dominant performance from 
Ritter, the Wolverines took the 
first game, 3-0. In the second 
matchup, Michigan erased a 4-2 
deficit with a six-run sixth inning, 
holding on to a 8-7 win. The Big 
Ten Championship was theirs. 
Leutele: Anything less than a 
championship would’ve felt like 
a disappointment. 
Merchant: 
I 
think 
that’s 
what you play for. You play for 
championships.
Marx: You can’t go into the 
World Series and not be battle 
tested. You have to learn how to 
battle, and (Northwestern and 
Iowa) taught us how to do it. 
No. 1 Michigan swept through 
its 
three-game 
regional 
slate 
effortlessly, setting up a super 
regional matchup against No. 
21 Washington, where the teams 
split the first two games to 
force a decisive third meeting. 
After falling behind 2-0 in the 
first 
inning, 
the 
Wolverines 
responded emphatically, scoring 
11 unanswered runs.
They were headed back to the 
World Series, their mission far 
from complete.
Merchant: Michigan softball 

in the past, you know, they 
hadn’t shown up in the World 
Series. They didn’t have great 
finishes there.
Leutele: They weren’t known 
for their success at the World 
Series. They were known to 
make it.
Hutchins: 
We 
were 
2-14 
in World Series history as a 
program when we got there.
Merchant: We hadn’t proven 
ourselves on that stage.
Ritter: They talked about the 
powerhouses, and we weren’t 
one of them.
Bercaw: And it was always, 
can 
Michigan 
do 
it, 
can 
Michigan do it? It was never 
expected, the way that in other 
years teams are expected to win 
when they’re ranked number 
one. It still felt like we were the 
underdogs.
Ritter: Nobody seemed to 
care too much about us.
Hutchins: Our kids were 
mad, and I loved it.
Haas: Hutch said something 
like, 
“Well 
you 
guys 
are 
underdogs. But so what? Go and 
prove yourselves.”
Milian: But I think we liked 
being the underdogs. We knew 
that we weren’t expected to win 
and I think we liked that.
Hutchins: They had a chip on 
their shoulder and they played it 
up big time. Cause everywhere 
we go, everybody’s talking about 
everybody but us.
Tholl: We used it as our fuel.
Merchant: The rest of the 
country doesn’t believe in us. 
We’ll show you what Michigan 
softball is about.
Michigan blanked DePaul, 3-0, 
and Texas, 4-0, to begin their 
World Series campaign. Against 
Tennessee, 
the 
Wolverines 
suffered a crushing 11 inning 
loss that ended on a 2-run walk-
off home run. A second loss to 
the Volunteers and their season 
would end the same as it had the 
past 7 trips. 
Hutchins: And we come back 
less than twelve hours later. We 
got off the field at 2 a.m. We had 
a noon game. I’m like, noon?
Tholl: We had had rain delays 
in the series that pushed the 
whole schedule back.
Milian: We barely got any 
sleep that night.

ORAL HISTORY 
From Page 10A

Ritter: We were all exhausted.
Marx: I remember being pretty 
crushed. I cried on the way back to 
the hotel. 
Leutele: We were like there’s no 
way that can happen again.
Leutele: I just remember the grit 
in Jenny Ritter’s face. We were all 
like, “If she’s gonna do that, who can 
stop her?” I really think we rallied 
around that belief.
Marx: We just decided the next 
game that this was going to be our 
shot, if it was going to be our last 
game then we were going to give it 
everything that we can.
Milian: I remember we watched 
so much film on the other pitcher, 
Tennessee’s Monica Abbott.
Hutchins: The other big dog.
Tholl: 
A 
really 
intimidating 
presence on the mound. And we just 
didn’t have our offense in sync like 
we did 60 games earlier.
Marx: You don’t go up against 
Monica Abbott and think you’ve got 
anything in the bag.
Bercaw: I remember Monica 
Abbott. … You hear the stats and how 
good they are. But the thing is, we 
prepped for all of that.
Ritter: What’s amazing about 
this team, though, was that when 
you feel like we’re hitting a dead 
end and there’s nothing we can do, 
somebody comes through and that’s 
how it’s been the entire season. 
Ritter: Bercaw came through.
Marx: Bercaw hits the home run 
— our first home run of the series — it 
just gave us life. Oh yeah, this is who 
we are, we can do this.
Ritter: All of a sudden there’s this 
adrenaline in our veins.
In the bottom of the fourth inning, 
Michigan was up 1-0 with two outs 
and a runner on second. Bercaw sent 
Abbott’s pitch over the fence for a two-
run home run. The blast proved to be 
game-winning, as the Wolverines won 
3-2.
Later that day, Michigan returned 
to action, battling UCLA — the two-
time defending champions — in Game 
1 of the World Series final. 
Ritter: We went back to the hotel, 
the idea was to rest and recover 
and try to figure out what the heck 
we were gonna do, because we 
had never been in the World Series 
championship before.
Hutchins: UCLA, they had been 
sitting around for a day watching us, 
and they got Ritter out early in the 
game - as soon as we got behind we 
took her out. She was tired. 
Marx: We had nothing left in the 
tank. 

Milian: They scored right out of 
the gate.
Ritter: To me, there was a little 
bit of a let down, at least on my part, 
that we made it, to be satisfied that 
we just made it to the World Series 
final. That was just a mental lapse in 
my judgement of feeling like we’ve 
done enough. 
Milian: And we knew we could 
beat them, it was just I think the 
Tennessee games took something 
out of us. We just needed to get some 
rest and come back.
Michigan dropped the opening 
game to UCLA, 5-0. 
Hutchins: Game 2 we rested up 
and told them, “Just play, don’t worry 
about it, you’re rested now.” 
Haas: We just kept doing what 
we’ve been doing. We just wanted to 
win a game.
Hutchins: We got behind in game 
2, 2-0, in the fifth inning. I’m like, 
“Wow, we’re not gonna score a run 
in the championship series.” We 
were the leading hitting team in the 
country.
Merchant: Even when we were 
down we didn’t panic, we didn’t give 
up.
Findlay: When we got down we 
didn’t get down on each other, we 
picked each other up.
Merchant: Maybe it was being a 
little bit naïve, a little bit young, and a 
little bit too cocky, but no matter who 
we were facing or what the situation 
was, we thought we were going to 
win.
The 
Wolverines 
were 
staring 
elimination in its face. With one out 
and a runner on first, Marx stood in 
the batters’ box.
Hutchins: And Becky Marx hit 
her famous homer to tie it up.
Marx: When I hit it I didn’t even 
know it went over. When Bonnie told 
me at first it was over the fence … I 
knew we were back in the game. 
Bolstered by a Merchant two-run 
double in the same inning, Michigan 
went on to win Game 2, 5-2, setting up 
a winner-take-all game the next night. 
UCLA struck first with a solo home 
run from first baseman Lisa Dodd. In 
the sixth inning, the Wolverines finally 
broke through when Findlay knocked 
an RBI single into right field. The two 
teams remained deadlocked into the 
bottom of the ninth, when the Bruins 
threatened to take the championship. 
Designated player Kristen Dedmon 
blooped a double and advanced to 
third on a sacrifice bunt, putting the 
winning run at third with just one out. 
Ritter, the ace, stood in the circle.
Ritter: UCLA, all they have to do 
is score that run. So I guarantee, they 
were feeling pretty dang good.
Tholl: I only allowed myself to 

do this for about 10-15 seconds, but I 
remember looking out into right field 
… and I was like “Wow, we were so 
close. We came so close.”
Ritter: (Hutch) tells me to walk 
the next two batters. … I hated it. I 
still hate it, to this day.
Marx: It was not one of those 
moments that I needed to calm her 
down. I just needed to let her go.
Ritter: This is a moment where 
we are 60 feet away from losing the 
World Series and we want to win so 
badly, so I just said, “OK, I’m going to 
do this.’
Milian: It was just that mental 
switch of “No, we’re going to do this. 
We’re going to get out of this and get 
to the next inning.” 
Marx: She just would not let 
anyone take this away from her. She 
was gonna be the pitcher that got up 
there and did it.
With the bases loaded, Ritter 
induced an inning-ending ground 
out from UCLA left fielder Ashley 
Herrera to retire the threat, keeping 
the season alive. 
Tholl: That’s a huge momentum 
shift. And it’s more of a momentum 
shift 
for 
the 
team 
that 
just 
squandered the opportunity.
Ritter: But the game’s still going.
The Wolverines wasted little time 
threatening in the top of the tenth, 
as Haas reached on a fielding error 
and freshman outfielder Alessandra 
Giampaolo recorded an infield single. 
The stage was set for Findlay, who 
strode to the dish with the go-ahead 
run in scoring position and two outs. 
Ritter: The fact that they pitched 
to Sam Findlay is still baffling to me.
Bercaw: 
Anytime 
that 
Sam 
would go up, you’d just kinda wait for 
the big hit to happen.
Leutele: We all believed in Sam 
so much in that moment. She’s gonna 
do this.
Motycka: Do you think it’s going 
to be a home run and something 
so glorious? No, but you knew she 
would make something happen.
Findlay: I liked pressure. … I 
knew I wanted to be in that position 
and I was confident.
Haas: I just kept on trying to 
make eye contact with her, to give 
her my energy.
Ritter: The whole team is up at 
the railing, I’m in the back corner 
literally focusing on nothing, just 
hoping somebody gets a hit.
Findlay: I saw a good pitch and I 
took a good swing and as soon as I hit 
it, you just kinda knew.
Ritter: All of a sudden I hear the 
crack of the bat, the team screaming, 
the ball going over the fence and 
I’m trying to figure out what just 
happened.

Hutchins: I was just wishing it 
over the fence. Get out, get out, get 
out.
Merchant: I was praying that it 
was going to go out.
Haas: I knew it was a bomb.
Tholl: I knew the moment it came 
off the bat, it was going out of the 
park.
Bercaw: It was a laser.
Marx: I just remember being like, 
“I can’t believe they just pitched to 
Sam Findlay. Of all the players in the 
whole country, you just pitched to 
Sam Findlay?” She just did what she 
does.
Findlay: The 
feeling 
I 
felt 
rounding third base heading home to 
see my teammates and seeing their 
faces, that’s something I’ll never 
forget.
Bercaw: It felt like a sealed-deal. 
… The emotion of that was just 
indescribable.
Findlay: To see how happy they 
were, it gave us the confidence to 
finish the bottom of that inning 
knowing we would bring Michigan 
the first softball championship. 
Findlay: It’s a hit that forever 
changed my life.
Hutchins: I immediately went 
into, okay gotta keep them calm. You 
know, we hadn’t won yet.
Ritter: I remember just talking to 
myself, this isn’t over yet. You’ve got 
to go out the same way you did every 
inning and you’ve got to get three 
more outs.
Tholl: Jennie Ritter was the 
bulldog we needed in the circle. Not 
once in that season had she fallen 
apart, and I knew she wasn’t going to 
do that in the brightest moment. 
Tholl: In the biggest moment of 
the season, she was going to be our 
rock.
Hutchins: It worked out, it all 
worked out.
In charge of preserving the three-
run cushion, Ritter retired two of the 
first three batters she faced, the lone 
baserunner reaching on a fielding 
error. With Michigan one out away, 
Dedmon lifted a towering fly ball to 
the left-side of the infield. 
Ritter: When that pop up came 
and I saw Merchant catch it, my first 
reaction … was thank god it’s over. 
Bercaw: I was out in right field, 
so I was always the last to get in. 
Everybody else is already celebrating 
by the time I reach the infield. 
Just heart-pumping, raw emotions 
everywhere.
Marx: Everyone was crying.
Bercaw: I just wanted to run 
in and hug somebody, jump and 
celebrate together. It was awesome. 
Haas: It’s the best day of our lives. 
And the celebration, it didn’t end.

The 
2005 
team 
became 
the 
first program located east of the 
Mississippi River to win the women’s 
softball College World Series, which 
began in 1982. It’s the only national 
title in Michigan softball’s 42-year 
history. 
Hutchins: A championship, it’s 
something that no (other) Michigan 
team has.
Tholl: Michigan winning the 
national championship gave hope to 
the rest of the country.
Leutele: I think it changed 
everything.
Tholl: It legitimized every athlete 
who played softball outside of the 
West Coast, and so I think that was 
our legacy. 
Ritter: It’s no longer a West Coast 
sport. We’re a cold weather school, 
up in the north playing on the road 
and practicing inside for our first 35 
games or so, yet we can still compete 
at that level.
Hutchins: I think it did open up 
the doors for a lot of people to say we 
can do this.
Merchant: It gave sixth graders 
in Michigan hope that they could 
compete at the highest level, whether 
it be at the University of Michigan or 
for any cold weather team.
Ritter: Make kids everywhere 
believe that this is possible, that they 
don’t just have to be in the West or in 
Florida and have a chance to play all 
the time to win. It’s a big deal for our 
sport.
Bercaw: I’m from a small town in 
Ohio. There was a family of kids from 
my hometown, they drove up to the 
World Series. … Situations like that, 
you could just see how it inspired 
girls. It doesn’t matter where you’re 
from or where you go, you can reach 
any level that you set out to reach.
Leutele: I was from Arizona, so as 
a child who had softball aspiration, I 
should have wanted to stay in the Pac-
10. ... I think other student athletes 
really realized that, wait a minute, I 
can go to another university and we 
can create a culture of that and really 
believe in it and not be afraid.
Hutchins: There’s no question 
that people have always noted to me 
how (the championship) changed 
the landscape. But we were never out 
to change the landscape. We were 
out to put Michigan on the map.
Ritter: This is a team that you 
find once in a lifetime. You want me 
to rank the teams that I’ve been on, 
USA and everything, the chemistry 
that energy that we had, nothing 
compares to this team. I don’t think 
anybody could’ve beaten us that 
year. 
... I truly in my heart believe that 
we were unbeatable.

Another year, same result against OSU

November. 
In college football, it’s the month 
where opportunities are missed, 
heroes are made and hearts are 
broken. Two months of success are 
nullified by catastrophic late-season 
failures. A season of mediocrity can 
be forgotten by a Rivalry Week upset. 
Or, in those rare and special years, a 
great team can be immortalized as 
legendary. 
In his first season in our NCAA 
14 simulation of Michigan football, 
fictional coach Stanford Lipsey can do 
just that. Entering the regular season’s 
home stretch with a 10-0 record, the 
upcoming fateful showdown with 
Ohio State looms large. 
But first, a trip to Iowa City 
presents a smaller, more remote 
hurdle: Overcome the notorious 
“Kinnick Curse” and clinch the 
Wolverines’ first-ever berth in the Big 
Ten Championship Game. 
Game 11: No. 1 Michigan at Iowa
Big Ten football fans know 
that if your team still has national 
championship hopes in November, 
the last place you want to be is Iowa’s 
Kinnick Stadium. The fearsome venue 
made victims of perfect seasons from 
Penn State and Michigan in November 
2008 and 2016, respectively, before 
dashing Ohio State’s College Football 

playoff hopes with a crushing upset in 
2017. And, because NCAA 14 still uses 
the old BCS system to determine who 
plays for the national championship, 
a loss at this stage could completely 
derail Lipsey’s honeymoon season. 
But the Hawkeyes’ late-season 
voodoo held no match for the 
Wolverines’ diverse passing attack. 
In the game’s first minute, a 62-yard 
touchdown 
pass 
from 
junior 
quarterback Dylan McCaffrey to 
junior wide receiver Ronnie Bell set 
the tone for a 35-19 Michigan victory. 
Iowa could do little to stop McCaffrey, 
whose 18 completions for 253 yards 
and two touchdowns demonstrated 
why the Wolverines boast the nation’s 
top passing offense. A punt return 
touchdown from sophomore safety 
Daxton Hill put the butter on the 
cornbread. 
With the win, Michigan booked 
its trip to the Big Ten Championship 
Game. Still, the achievement is but 
background noise to the monumental 
task directly ahead. 
Game 12: No. 1 Michigan vs No. 15 
Ohio State
Ohio State is in the midst of an 
identity crisis as losses to Cincinnati, 
No. 24 Michigan State, and No. 7 
Indiana secured the Buckeyes’ worst 
record since 2011. As a result, the 
Wolverines entered Rivalry Week as 
heavy favorites. 
Given the recent history of The 
Game, it was the perfect scenario for 

a heartbreak. Again. 
With two minutes remaining, 
Ohio State quarterback Justin Fields 
stepped under center with the 
chance to complete that heartbreak. 
Michigan had just scored its second 
touchdown of the game to cut the 
Buckeyes’ lead to six, but a couple 
first downs would render that score 
irrelevant, sending the Wolverines 
home, tail between legs. 
Fields took the first down snap, 
faked to his running back and 
bounced outside on the read option. 
What little daylight he saw was 
quickly swallowed up by junior 
cornerback Gemon Green. Fields had 
trouble with the tuck, the ball hit the 

turf, and Green fell on it. 
Three plays later, the Wolverines 
took the lead. A Big House that had 
been emptying out moments earlier 
suddenly pulsed at the thought that 
the most brutal stretch in the history 
of the rivalry could finally be ending.
But then, as if the game itself 
realized the absurdity of a first-year 
coach ending two decades of sheer 
dominance, Justin Fields rose like a 
demon summoned from the depths 
of Columbus. He had been given 1:33 
to save Ohio State’s season, and he 
used every second of it. Five straight 
completions set up the easiest game-
winning field goal in the history of 
the rivalry and kicker Blake Haubeil 
buried it. Final score: 23-21, Ohio 
State. Even the simulation knows.
Imperfect.

Around the country
Michigan’s Rivalry Week loss 
dropped it to No. 5 in the country, 
behind the two remaining undefeated 
teams — Alabama and Louisville 
— and two fellow one-loss teams, 
Clemson and … Indiana. This means 
there is a slim, but real, chance we 
see Tom Allen coaching in a National 
Championship. Unsettling. 
The 
Wolverines 
will 
take 
on 
Nebraska 
in 
the 
Big 
Ten 
Championship, setting the stage 
for more corn jokes. In the SEC, 
top-ranked 
Alabama 
will 
face 
No. 6 Florida, while the Pac-12 
Championship 
features 
No. 
25 
California and No. 16 UCLA. No. 
3 Clemson will, shockingly, face a 
somewhat 
formidable 
opponent 
in No. 10 Virginia Tech for this 
year’s 
ACC 
Championship. 
The 
Big 12, meanwhile, did not have a 
championship game when NCAA 14 
was released, but Oklahoma would 
win anyway. 
Despite the heartbreak against the 
Buckeyes, Michigan’s season is not 
over. It has a chance to win its first Big 
Ten title since 2004, and, although 
there’s almost no chance of a national 
championship berth, the Rose Bowl is 
a hell of a consolation prize. 
Still, this Wolverines team — like 
many that came before it — will be left 
wondering, “what if?” The numbers 
say this team is elite, but in Ann Arbor, 
performance against Ohio State is one 
of the most important measures of 
success. 
And this year, Michigan failed.

‘M’ rebounds, secures virtual Rose Bowl victory

In the last part of The Daily’s 
NCAA 14 simulation of Michigan 
football, the Wolverines saw 
their 
national 
championship 
hopes erased by Ohio State. 
Despite almost unprecedented 
levels of success in his first 
season, coach Stanford Lipsey’s 
first 
matchup 
against 
the 
Buckeyes ended in the same way 
as the previous eight renditions 
of The Game. 
But the season isn’t over. 
Thanks to some early-season 
struggles 
from 
Ohio 
State, 
Michigan still has the Big Ten 
Championship 
Game 
and 
a 
potential Rose Bowl berth to end 
the year on a strong note. The 

Wolverines haven’t even been 
to a Rose Bowl since 2007, so 
the famously patient Michigan 
faithful 
would 
surely 
deem 
a 2-0 finish to the season an 
unmitigated success. 
Right?
Big Ten Championship Game: 
No. 5 Michigan vs Nebraska
Do you remember that scene 
from Interstellar where Cooper’s 
driving his kids to school and 
quickly abandons the road when 
he sees a rogue drone flying 
overhead? His truck cops a flat 
tire and there’s no road for him 
to follow to get to the drone, 
so he plows right through a 
cornfield and eventually reaches 
his goal. 
That’s essentially the story of 
this game, a 90’s football fan’s 
wet 
dream. 
The 
Wolverines 

had their goal in sight — the 
program’s 
first 
Rose 
Bowl 
appearance since 2007 — and ran 
right through the Cornhuskers 
to reach it. Led by an outstanding 
168 yards and two touchdown 
catches 
from 
senior 
wide 
receiver Nico Collins, Michigan 
harvested a 38-17 blowout over 
Nebraska. Sophomore defensive 
tackle Christopher Hinton led 
the defense with ten tackles, and 
junior linebacker Cam McGrone 
tallied two sacks and a fumble 
recovery. 
With Nebraska out of the way, 
Lipsey’s Wolverines move on to 
Pasadena for the Rose Bowl and 
a chance to salvage some joy at 
the end of an imperfect season. 
Rose Bowl: No. 3 Michigan vs 
No. 20 California
What better way for a team to 

bid farewell to its seniors than 
a game at the most historic and 
picturesque venue in college 
football? 
I guess virtually all players 
would 
prefer 
a 
national 
championship, but even so, the 
sun setting over the Rose Bowl 
is just more poetic than the roof 
retracting over the Mercedes 
Benz™ Tostitos™ Coke Zero™ 
National Championship Game 
presented by Bass Pro Shops™. 
Plus, the open air helps prevent 
the spread of disease as the Cal 
and Michigan alumni in the 
stands take every chance they 
can to mention where they went 
to school.
For the Wolverines’ seniors, it 
was a goodbye for the ages. In a 
38-13 Michigan victory, Collins 
capped off his illustrious career 

with six receptions for 106 yards 
and a touchdown. McCaffrey’s 
other two touchdown passes 
went to senior tight end Nick 
Eubanks, 
and 
senior 
safety 
Brad Hawkins pulled in an 
interception for good measure. 
Even the special teams got 
involved — senior kicker Quinn 
Nordin finished a career full of 
hits and misses with a 53-yard 
field goal in the third quarter. 
Like many Wolverine senior 
classes in recent memory, this 
one will leave with questions 
about what could have been. It 
isn’t easy to stick with a program 
through a coaching change — 
especially when the new guy 
has never coached football in his 
life — but in the end, they will 
certainly be remembered fondly 
in Michigan lore.
