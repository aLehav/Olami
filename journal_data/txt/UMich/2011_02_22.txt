Faculty leaders
expected to meet
with Coleman to
discuss plan today

Members of the lead faculty
governing body planto present a
faculty counterproposal to Uni-
versity Provost Philip Hanlon's
recommendation to lengthen
the tenure probationary period
for faculty members this week.
Senate Advisory Committee
on University Affairs members
discussed yesterday Hanlon's
proposal, which would change
Regent Bylaw 5.09 by length-
ening the maximum tenure
probationary period University
schools and colleges can choose
for faculty from eightyears to 10
years.
SACUA Chair Ed Rothman,
a professor of statistics, said
at yesterday's discussion that
he agrees with Hanlon's sug-
gestion to give faculty more
decision-making power, but dis-
agrees with Hanlon's proposal
to change the bylaw. -

Rothman and Gina Poe,
SACUA vice chair and associate
professor of anesthesiology and
molecular and integrative phys-
iology in the Medical School, are
working on counterproposals
that offer short-term and long-
term solutions to what they feel
are problems with tenure proba-
tionary periods.
Rothman and Poe plan to
meet with University President
Mary Sue Coleman today to talk
about their counterproposal.
They said yesterday that a draft
should be available for faculty
distribution this week.
Rothman said he doesn't
think the tenure probationary
period should be extended for
all faculty members but sug-
gested they be able to opt for an
extension on an individual basis
without questioi or penalty
from the administration.
However, Rothman said this
is only a short-term solution to a
larger, long-term problem - ill-
defined standards for obtaining
tenure. Rothman said externally
generated standards, like pub-
lishing requirements for faculty
members, diminish quality of
work. He said tenure should be
determined by internally gener-

Few male students
seek to enter

Daily StaffReporter
Nursing School junior David
Kalvelage has only one com-
plaint about his area of study,
and it isn't that he's typically

only one of several males in his
Nursing School classes.
"Often nurses can be very
chatty and gossipy," he said.
As a male in the School of
Nursing, Kalvelage is often in
the minority in his classes and
at the Oakwood Annapolis Hos-
pital in Wayne, Mich. where
he works while pursuing his
undergraduate degree.
But Kalvelage said being in
this position is often an advan-

tage. Being one of the few males
in the undergraduate nursing
program has set him apart from
his classmates, he said.
"Professors might remember
me a little easier," Kalvelage
said. "I've noticed a couple of
times, though, I'll only have met
a professor once, (and) the pro-
fessor will know me right off the
bat."
Kalvelage isn't the only male
in the School of Nursing who

feels his situation is a positive
one. Several males studying and
working in the school said being
in the minority is often benefi-
cial, offering them aunique edu-
cation and segue into the field.
According to data provided
to The Michigan Daily by the
School of Nursing, out of 146
traditional freshmen and soph-
omore cross-campus transfer

Tent city looks for sponsor

10 residents stay in
Camp Take Notice
during winter
By AUSTIN WORDELL
Daily StaffReporter
In the woods near I-94 off
Wagner Road, a path opens up
to a clearing where 10 current
residents of Camp Take Notice,

a group of homeless individuals
who live in tents, continue their
self-governing community dur-
ing the winter months.
Living in separate tents with
one large tent designated for
group meetings, residents of
CTN have been keeping warm
this season with small propane
heaters and two wood-burning
stoves in the large tent.
Diminished by about one-
third of its population during

warmer weather, CTN currently
faces the challenges of finding
a private sponsor and looming
budget cuts of local non-profit
organizations.
Located on public land that
isn't easily visible from nearby
roads, members of the camp are
seeking a private land sponsor
so they can move to a more per-
manent location. Trespassing

Digitization of

By RACHEL BRUSSTAR
Daily StaffReporter
With Google's help, it is
becoming increasingly easi-
er for students to ditch their

paperbacks and hardcover
textbooks for e-readers and
iPads.
The option partly stems
from the University's involve-
ment with the Google Books
Library Project, in which tens
of thousands of volumes from
campus library collections
have been digitized each week
since 2004. According to Paul
Courant, the University's dean

of libraries, the project is cur-
rently 60 percent complete in
its digitization process - with
more than 1 million volumes
currently readable and more
than 5 million volumes text-
searchable online.

A PIECE OF HISTORY

Holding class on holidays

Despite the everyday hustle and
bustle of University students' schedules
yesterday, many people outside the Uni-
versity community didn't have work or
class due to Presidents' Day.
When the University recognizes a
federal holiday, students, faculty and
staff receive the day off. But when the
University chooses not to recognize a
federaliholiday - like Presidents' Day -
University classes and activities aren't
cancelled.
In regard to Presidents' Day, Univer-
sity spokesman Rick Fitzgerald said he
was unsure if the University has ever
recognized the federal holiday.
"It's not been one of the recognized
federal holidays for a long time," he
said.
However, the University doesn't hold
classes on Martin Luther King Jr. Day

because it wants students, faculty and
staff tobe available to attend MLK Day
related events on campus, according to
Fitzgerald.
"(Martin Luther King Jr. Day) is not
a holiday in the sense that the staff has
the day off. It's just a day when regular
classes are suspended so that students
and faculty are able to attend the many,
some, or all of the of number of sympo-
sium events," Fitzgerald said.
The University chooses only to
eliminate classes on MLK Day because
it fears that calling it a holiday will
decrease attendance at symposium
events, he said. Fitzgerald added that
the suspension of classes on MLK Day
has been a part of the academic calen-
dar since the creation of the symposium
25 years ago.

Protesters listen to a rally as sleet falls outside the state Capitol Monday, Feb. 21, 2011, in Madison, Wis.
Budget plan -may tilIt
political playing field

Debate continues
over union rights
in Wisconsin
MADISON, Wis. (AP) - The
high-stakes fight in Wiscon-
sin over union rights is about
more than pay and benefits in
the public sector. It could have
far-reaching effects on electoral
politics in this and other states
by helping solidify Republican
power for years, experts said
yesterday.
While Republican Gov. Scott
Walker's plan to wipe out collec-
tive bargaining rights for most
public employees has galvanized
Democrats and union members
in opposition, the GOP could
benefit long-term by crippling a
key source of campaign funding
and volunteers for Democrats.
"It would be a huge landscape-
altering type of action, and it
would tilt the scales significant-
ly in favor of the Republicans,"
said Mike McCabe, director
of the Wisconsin Democracy
Campaign, which has long
tracked union involvement in
Wisconsin elections. "This is
a national push, and it's being
simultaneously pushed in a num-
ber of states. I think Wisconsin
is moving the fastest and most
aggressively so far."

The National Education Asso-
ciation, which represents 3.2
million workers, said teachers'
collective bargaining rights are
also being targeted by propos-
als in Ohio, Idaho, Indiana and
other states.
Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, a
Republican, said yesterday law-
makers should pass a proposal
to bar public employees from
negotiating health insurance
benefits. In Indiana, a GOP-led
House committee debated yes-
terday a right-to-work bill that
would prohibit union member-
ship from being a condition of
employment.
The Wisconsin plan strikes
at a key Democratic Party con-
stituency by eliminating the
mandatory union dues teachers
and other public workers are
required to pay. The plan would
take away the ability of most
municipal and state employees to
bargain any condition of employ-
ment beyond their base sala-
ries - including benefits, work
schedules and overtime pay. And
unions would need to survive a
vote of their members every year
to stay in existence.
Public safety workers, includ-
ing police officers, firefighters
and state troopers, would keep
their rights under the plan.
Those unions endorsed Walker
in his campaign for governor

last year, but he said they were
exempted because he did not
want to jeopardize public safety
if they walked off the job.
Nancy MacLean, a labor his-
torian at Duke University, said
eliminating unions would do to
the Democratic Party what get-
ting rid of socially conservative
churches would do to Repub-
licans. She called unions "the
most important mass member-
ship, get-out-the vote wing of the
Democratic Party."
"It's stunning partisan calcu-
lation on the governor's part, and
really ugly," she said.
Walker has denied political
motivations, saying his proposal
is about cutting state and local
spending for years to come. But
in an interview with The Asso-
ciated Press last week as pro-
tests raged inside the Capitol, he
acknowledged his plan to allow
workers to opt out of payingtheir
dues could cripple unions.
"That's something that threat-
ens these national leaders. They
want that money. That's their
existence. Having mandatory
membership is what keeps them
going," he said. "If people have a
choice, I think many of them are
afraid that things will change,
and that's where the intensity
is. But for us, it's about balanc-
ing the budget and doing it in the
most responsible way possible."

NURSING
From Page 1
in last year's entering School of
Nursing undergraduate class.
Of the school's 225 master's stu-
dents, 16 are male. And of the 69
doctoral students in the school,
only two are male.
For the University's sec-
ond career Bachelor of Science
in Nursing program, which is
intended for college graduates
interested in obtaining an accel-
erated degree in nursing in 12
months, the 2010 entering class
has the highest percentage of
males of all nursing programs
at 17 percent. But at 13 male stu-
dents, this is still a lower num-
ber than male enrollment in the
school's undergraduate and mas-
ter's programs.
The gender imbalance at the
school reflects the number of
male professional nurses - with
6 percent of the total population
of registered nurses being male,
according to the nursing informa-
tion website MinorityNurse.com.
The numbers of males enrolled
in School of Nursing degree pro-
grams is just above or below this
percentage.
According to the most recent
data available in the University's
StatusofWomenReportfor2007-
2008, 8 percent of students who
graduated with a baccalaureate
degree from the School of Nurs-
ing during that academic year
were males. Additionally, males
made up 6 percent of the gradu-
ating master's class that year, and
no males were in the graduating
doctoral class.
Kalvelage said he thinks low
male interest in the field is due
to the unrealistic perceptions the
media produce. Kalvelage cited
the films "Meet the Parents" and
"Yes Man" - which have male
nurses as main characters - as
examples of the media skewing
the image of the male nurse.
"The media suggests thatnurs-
ing isn't a manly field to be in," he
said.
Not only are students in the
School of Nursing predomi-
nantly female, but women have
also made up the majority of the
school's faculty since the 90s,
according to the Status of Women
Report. In 1990, there were 62
tenured and tenure-track women

faculty in the School of Nurs-
ing, but only 4 men in the same
positions. In 2007, there were
38 females and three males who
were tenured and tenure-track
faculty members.
Nursing School Prof. Reg Wil-
liams said he finds the imbal-
anced ratio of males and females
in the field unfortunate, but sug-
gested there may be hope for
improvement.
"Medicine started out being
predominantly men, and over
time now, it's evened out in terms
of men and women," he said.
Nursing School senior Kim-
berly Cristobal, president of the
Student Nurses' Association on
campus, said she's noticed the
gender imbalance in her classes,
in clinical practice and within her
student organization. She added
that she's fielded patient requests
to be cared for only by a female
nurse, though male and female
nurses are generally assigned the
same tasks within a health care
setting.
"(These patients) have been
older women, or those who object
due to religious reasons or mod-
esty," Cristobal said.
She said she's observed more
males pursuing graduate work
to advance to specific nursing
positions, like nurse anesthetist,
which is one of the top-paying
areas of nursing that many male
nurses choose to enter. Accord-
ing to the American Association
of Nurse Anesthetists website,
about 46 percent of all nurse
anesthetists are males.
Kalvelage said he's considering
becoming a certified registered
nurse anesthetist in the future.
He said he thinks many men
interested in medicine choose to
be doctors since it's often viewed
as a more prominent position
than a nurse.
"I think it's important to
men to have a prestigious job,"
Kalvelage said. "I think nurs-
ing, as a very care-focused field,
expects women to fulfill that car-
ing role."
Williams, who has been teach-
ing atthe Universitysince the80s,
said he's seen the nursing stereo-
type persist since he was a college
student. As a nursing student at
the University of Washington in
Seattle in the 70s, Williams said
he wrote a research paper that
considered the presence of males

inthe field.
"I argued at the time that the
field would benefit from a greater
balance of men and women," he
said.
School of Nursing Dean Kath-
leen Potempa wrote in a state-
ment on the School of Nursing's
website that building a hetero-
geneous population at the school
is a priority for students, faculty
and administrators.
"The school places great value
on diversity and multiculturalism
and seeks to ensure a positive,
supportive climate in which all
individuals are welcome,"Potem-
pa wrote. "We are a community
that is committed to building
an environment that values and
respects every person, regardless
of gender, age, race, sexual orien-
tation, cultural background, reli-
gion, nationality or beliefs."
Nursing School junior Kyle
Brown said he thinks the stereo-
type of nursing being a female-
oriented field is decades old and
is difficult to shake. However,
Brown, who has been working in
a hospital for a few years, said he
has found it refreshing to be one
of the few males in a nursing set-
ting.
"I went to a private all-boys
school during high school, and
now that I'm in nursing school
...it's a good change of pace," he
said.
Williams said despite being
one of the few males in hisgradu-
ating class at the University of
Utah, he was able to thrive due to
the support of his professors.
"When I think back to my
undergraduate education... I was
very fortunate," he said. "I wasn't
treated anydifferentlyormadeto
feel foolish."
Each male said ultimately, they
are proud of their work and are
excited to be able to provide a
unique contributionto the field.
"So often I hear that nurses are
the ones that patients remember
the most," Kalvelage said. "They
can have the most personal
impact (on patients) and can be
there during all steps of care."
Brown said he found his call-
ing in nursing after observing the
interesting and meaningful work
nurses have the opportunity to
do.
"When you leave work for the
day, you feel like you've done
something worthwhile," he said.

Alaska state rep.
refuses airport
pat-down search
An Alaska state lawmaker is
making her way back to the state
Capitol after refusing a pat-down
search at a Seattle airport, a
spokeswoman said.
Rep. Sharon Cissna underwent
a body scan as she was preparing
to leave Seattle-Tacoma Interna-
tional Airport Sunday and was
then required to undergo the pat-
down by Transportation Safety
Administration officials, said
Michelle Scannell, her chief of
staff.
Scannell' said the TSA called
for the pat-down because the scan
showed Cissna had had a mastec-
tomy.
The TSA, on its website, says
* security officers "will need to see
and touch your prosthetic device,
cast or support brace as part of the
screening process."
Scannell did not elaborate
beyond the statement. TSA
spokesman Kawika Riley, after
being asked to respond to Cissna's
comments, issued a general state-
ment that did not mention Cis-
sna or the Anchorage Democrat's
claims.

36 people killed in
Mali stampede
At least 36 people were killed
in a stampede yesterday when
a crowd surged against a metal
barrier after a Muslim ceremony,
Mali's minister of interior security
and civil protection said.
Sadio Gassame said the stam-
pede at Bamako's Modibo Keita
Stadium took place during a cer-
emony marking the Muslim holy
period of Maouloud. The incident
occurred as tens of thousands of
people were attempting to leave
through a metallic enclosure.
Anguished families gathered
outside the.capital's Gabriel Toure
Hospital where the staff was pre-

paringto post a list of the dead. At
least 64 others were wounded.
Sidiki Coulibaly was visibly
shaken as he waited for the dread-
ed news. "I've already had it con-
firmed that my aunt died. We are
now trying to find out what hap-
pened to her daughter. She's just
10 years old. They go to this event
together everyyear," he said.

Former dictator's
son dies of cancer
The eldest son of the late dic-

makes it more difficult to recover
a huge fortune amassed by his
family..
Gustavo Stroessner, a former
air force colonel, died of lung can-
cer Sunday, according to officials
at La Costa hospital. He was 66.
Stroessner fled with his father
when the dictatorship fell and
spent two decades in exile in Bra-
zil. The former dictator died in
2006 at the age of 93 in Brasilia,
and his son finally returned to
Asuncion last year after a judge

phia and head overseas for the
first time.
Educators want more minor-
ity students to follow the lead of
Adeyina, an African-American
graphic design major. Foreign
study is seen as crucial to student
development and even as a key to
national security, yet minority
participationbadlylags their over-
all presence on college campuses.
"It's really a matter of persuad-
ing young students of color that
this is possible for them and this
is necessary forrthem," saidPeggy
Blumenthal, executive vice presi-

dent of the Institute of Interna-
tional Education. "You come back
changed, more self-confident."
About 81 percent of study-
abroad students are white,
although whites represent 63 per-
cent of enrollment in higher edu-
cation, according to 2008-09 data
released in November by the New
York-based institute.
Blacks comprise 4.2 percent of
study-abroad students but are13.5
percent of the college population.
Latinos are 6 percent of study-
abroad participants but nearly
12 percent of higher ed students.
Asian-Americans, representing
6.8 percent of college students,
are slightly overrepresented in
study abroad at 7.3 percent.
Barriers often include lack of
funds, fear of racism, worries
about delayed graduation, and
few role models - either family
or faculty - who have traveled
abroad.
But better marketing might
help. Instead of touting foreign
study as an essential cultural
experience, universities could
stress it as a path toward self-reli-
ance, independent thinking and
valuable job skills, said Augus-
tana College researcher Mark
Salisbury.

At least six killed,
15 injured in deadly,
military attacks
ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP)
- Elite troops loyal to the sit-
ting president Laurent Gbagbo
entered opposition neighbor-
hoods in Ivory Coast's biggest
city yesterday, throwing gre-
nades, firing machine guns and
attacking the population with
rocket launchers, witnesses
said.
The attack happened as
an African Union delegation
arrived in a last-ditch effort to
find a solution to the crisis that
has gripped this nations since a
contested election nearly three
months ago.
At least six people were
killed during the yesterday
assault, including a 14-year-old
boy who was rushed to a local
clinic in the Treichville district
of Abidjan. Doctors said he died
of blood loss and a reporter saw
his corpse, his chest and abdo-
men crisscrossed by hundreds
of shrapnel wounds.
A few blocks away, dozens of
community members sat vigil
around a second body, this one
of a young man draped in a
bloody sheet who had half his
face torn off by what witnesses
said was fire from a machine
gun mounted on the back of a
police truck.
A reporter was led to the
spot where two more people
had died, and whose bodies
had been taken away. At least
15 people were wounded and
those that could talk say they
recognized the signature red
berets of the presidential guard
as well as the elite unit's insig-
nia on the trucks.

The crackdown happened
in neighborhoods that support
opposition leader Alassane
Ouattara, who is the interna-
tionally recognized president of
Ivory Coast. He is expected to
receive the AU delegation today
inside the hotel where he has
been barricaded since the Nov.
28 election, unable to govern
the country he was elected to
lead because the sitting presi-
dent refuses to go.
Laurent Gbagbo, who has
been in power for a decade, has
refused to accept the results
issued by his country's elec-
toral commission which are
considered legitimate by the
United Nations and all the
international observation mis-
sions. The country's constitu-
tional council, headed by one of
Gbagbo's closest advisers, has
overturned those results.
While the sound of explo-
sions echoed through the town,
the pomp and ceremony that
accompanied the arrival of
four African presidents sent to
resolve the political crisis con-
tinued as if nothing was going
on.
The AU delegation first
went to the presidency and is
expected on Tuesday to head
to the Golf Hotel, a resort hotel
on an arm of Abidjan's lagoon
where Ouattara and his staff
live under 24-hour U.N. guard.
The panel created by the Afri-
can Union comes on the heels
of numerous other mediation
efforts and is the latest attempt
to try to find a graceful exit for
Gbagbo, who has been able to
cling to power because he still
controls the army.
The U.N. estimates close to
300 people have been killed
since the vote, a majority of
whom were supporters of Ouat-

tara.
The five president panel
includes the presidents of Chad,
Mauritania, South Africa and
Tanzania. Another panel mem-
ber, Burkina Faso's President
Blaise Compaore, canceled
his trip to Abidjan after a vio-
lent youth militia aligned with
Gbagbo descended on the air-
port late Sunday, saying they
planned to attack Compaore's
convoy if he attempted to enter
the country.
Of the five, Compaore has
been the most vocal supporter
of Ouattara. By contrast, Zuma
has suggested that the results,
which have already been cer-
tified by the United Nations
and accepted by governments
around the world, should be
reviewed.
Neither side believes the
mediation effort will work.
Gbagbo's advisers have said
they will not accept the pan-
el's conclusions if the panel
attempts to tell Gbagbo to leave:
Ouattara's side is equally
pessimistic. His prime minister,
Guillaume Soro, said last week
he expects the negotiation
attempt to fail. He called on
Ouattara's supporters to launch
an 'Egypt-style' revolution.
In Ouattara neighborhoods
over the weekend, police
opened fire in places where res-
idents were attempting to hold
meetings. On Monday, shots
could be heard ringing out from
Treichville including what
sounded like heavy artillery.
Large caliber bullet holes
riddled the storefronts in Treich-
ville and a hole 2-feet in diameter
was visible in the concrete side
of a building that, witnesses say,
was blown open by a rocket. Doc-
tors say security forces used gre-
nades during the operation.

Chicago prepares
to elect next mayor

Candidates aim to
force second vote in
April runoff
CHICAGO (AP) - Former
White House chief of staff Rahm
Emanuel's main rivals in the race
to succeed Chicago Mayor Rich-
ard Daley spent yesterday doing
some last-minute campaigning
and scratching for every vote they
could find in the hopes of forcing
anApril runoff.
Former Chicago schools presi-
dent Gery Chico and former U.S.
Sen. Carol Moseley Braun each
predicted would receive the votes
necessary to deny Emanuel an
outright victory today and to
force a two-person runoff.
The fourth major candidate,
City Clerk Miguel del Valle, also
has pleaded with voters through-
out the campaign to send the race
to a runoffso they have more time
to decide.
"We expect a runoff and I
think you'll see that tomorrow
and then we can get the race on
and going right away," said Chico,

who spent much of yesterday
riding Chicago Transit Author-
ity trains and telling commuters
what he plansto do if elected.
There will bean April 5 runoff
between the top two vote-getters
unless someone receives more
than 50 percent of the vote today.
Recent polls showed Emanuel
nearing that margin with Chico,
Braun and del Valle fighting for
second place. Two other candi-
dates - William "Dock" Walls
and Patricia Van Pelt-Watkins -
are also running.
"It's probably going to wind up
in a runoff, but that's ok, we can
handle that," Braun said during a
fiery South Side news conference
attended by some of her most
powerful backers, including the
Rev. Jesse Jackson and U.S. Reps.
Bobby Rush and Danny Davis.
Davis, who withdrew from
the race in December in what he
called an act of black unity, is fea-
tured in a new radio ad in which
he asks voters to back Braun and
recounts how his fatherused to
tell him that the Bible says "any
manwho willnot support his own
house isworse than an infidel."

TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -
Two former presidents - one
Republican, the other a Demo-
crat - will chair a new national
institute to promote civility in
political discourse in the city
where U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Gif-
fords was severely wounded in
a shooting rampage that left six
dead, officials announced yes-
terday.
The National Institute for
Civil Discourse will be run by
the University of Arizona. For-
mer presidents George H.W.
Bush and Bill Clinton will
serve as its honorary co-chair-
men.
"Our country needs a setting
for political debate that is both
frank and civil, and the Nation-
al Institute for Civil Discourse
can make a significant contri-
bution toward reaching this
goal," Bush said in a prepared
statement.
Clinton said the institute
"can elevate the tone of dia-
logue in our country, and in so
doing, help us to keep moving
toward 'a more perfect union."'

five others were killed. Giffords
was among 13 people injured.
While it is widely suspected
that Jared Loughner, 22, who
faces charges in the shooting,
suffers from mental illness,
many have focused on the bitter
political climate in which the
assault occurred.
Shortly before the ram-
page, Giffords herself wrote an
e-mail to Trey Grayson, direc-
tor of Harvard University's
Institute of Politics, complain-
ing of the incendiary rhetoric in
her last campaign, and asking
if his group couldn't do some-
thing.
"Well, today the congress-
woman's own hometown uni-
versity has decided to do just
that," said Fred DuVal, vice
chairman of the Arizona Board
of Regents. "And Trey Grayson
... has joined OUR board."
The institute's goal is to
develop programs, stage con-
ferences, design curricula and
encourage research intended
to promote more civility in the
political arena, said its director,
Brint Milward. For instance, he
said it could back research on
such areas as "cognitive science
and how the brain responds to

one is always ready to man the
barricades?"
The institute - funded in
part by a grant from Tucson-
based health care provider
Providence Service Corp. and
to be housed in one of firm's
downtown buildings - would
cooperate with similar organi-
zations and institutions across
the country, Milward said, "to
create an archipelago of organi-
zations that want to promote a
different style of politics."
DuVal said the institute
might even be able to influence
"the dark arts of cable TV."
Greta Van Susteren, host of the
Fox News Channel's "On the
Record," is among those named
to the institute's board.
Milward said the institute's
first event will be an executive
forum that will bring together
"a very diverse and very well-
known group of individuals, all
of whom have thought deeply
about the problems of our poli-
tics and the benefits of a more
civil discourse that would bring
us help in governing the United
States more effectively." He
would not say when that would
be or who would be participat-
ing.

One union doesn'tft all.
'U' should focus on specific needs of GSRAs
The issue of unionization has recently become a major con-
cern for graduate students at the University. The Graduate
Employees' Organization is lobbying to bring graduate stu-
dent research assistants under the umbrella of its union, and the
University is declining to negotiate this issue with GEO. While GEO
hasn't gone on strike, members are not happy about the University's
current stance at the bargaining table. The University is under no
obligation to discuss GSRA unionization with GEO, but it's important
that it recognizes the needs of GSRAs - who do invaluable work on
their research projects - and be sure that they are being met.

GEO is currently in negotiations with the
University about its contract. Among the issues
on the bargaining table isthe desire to unionize
GSRAs. As a result of a 1981 Michigan Employ-.
ment Relations Commission ruling in which
the University contested GSRAs status as union
members, GEO only represents graduate stu-
dent instructors and graduate student staff
assistants. GEO wants to bring GSRAs into its
collective bargaining agreementto help address
issues of wage discrepancies, concerns of dis-
abled and international GSRAs and other issues
pertaining to working conditions.
According to Jeff Frumkin, the associate
vice provost and senior director of academic
resources, the University has a permissive
right to not discuss this issue and has chosen
not to do so. Since GSRAs are not protected
by GEO, GEO doesn't have the authority to
negotiate GSRA rights. GEO is overstepping
its bounds in trying to bring GSRAs into its
bargaining agreement and needs to recognize
whereis authority ends. But the University;
needs to ,work directly with GSRAs to make
sure that their needs are being met, their con-
cerns are being addressed and they know what
resources are available to them if they have an
issue to discuss.

In an interview with the Daily, Frumkin said
the University doesn't think it's in GSRAs' best
interest to join GEO because a collective bar-
gaining agreement wouldn't properly address
the specific issues related to each GSRA
research project. Many GSRAs agree with this
sentiment and have indicated that they don't
want to join GEO. But the University cannot
completely ignore the needs of GSRAs. Clearly
there is a missing link in this situation, and the
University needs to address this concern.
If GSRAs want to campaignfor unionization
that is their right, butthey needto actively pur-
sue this option with GEO behind them. Not the
other way around. Currently, GEO is attempt-
ing to assimilate GSRAs into its union by ask-
ing them to sign membership cards, but there
should also be active participation by GSRAs so
it's evident that they are collectively on board
with this decision.
There are undoubtedly situations in which
a GSRA may require assistance in dealing
with a faculty member or the conditions of
his or her work at the University,,but union-
izing may not be the most effective solution.
Instead, the University must be willing to help
GSRAs by expanding or implementing neces-
sary resources.

Remember the food pyramid?
Think back to your elemen-
tary school's cafeteria - I
canstillvisualize
that multi-col-
ored guide to
eating well. Back
then, following
the pyramid's
recommenda-
tions - lots of
carbohydrates, MARY
followed closely DEMERY
by fruit and veg-
etables - seemed
simple enough, though that's not to
say I actually followed it. I was terri-
bly picky, and my own move toward
healthy eating didn't really start
until my sophomore year of college
when I finally learned to cook for
myself..
But back then, the stakes didn't
seem so dire. Today, thanks to the
obesity epidemic, every bite we take
is loaded with more than calories.
For some, a bite is loaded with guilt,
for others, with wonder: Am Ieating
the "right" food? Is this good for me?
Personal opinions about what
constitutes healthy eating vary, but
the Department of Agriculture and
Department of Health and Human
Services are trying to make that
simpler. Every five years, the depart-
ments release a new set of Dietary
Guidelines. In the past, it has been
difficult to separate these recom-
mendations from the desires of the
powerful farm-interested lobbyist.
As a result, consumer health was
often secondary to the meat and
dairy lobbyists.
But the newest set of Dietary
Guidelines for 2010 - released in
last month - resist these power-
ful lobbyists more than ever before.
That's not to say these guidelines are
perfect. You can still see the influ-
'ence of the meat and dairy lobbyists,
but it's not as transparent as in years
past. This batch of guidelines also

moves closer to a non-biased map for
healthy eating.
Simplicity was one of the most
powerful themes to emerge from
the 2010 guidelines. In essence, we
should eatless. This is tough, practi-
cal and much-needed advice. It may.
sound harsh coming from a govern-
ment agency, but it's time we face
our demons with eating openly and
honestly. We cannot sustainthe cur-
rent way we eat - both for health
reasons and for the environment's
sake. The recommendation to eat
less is a wonderful start.
The guidelines recommend doing
so by supplementing your diet with
fruits and vegetables - ideally, your
plate will be half full. At first glance,
that's a daunting amount of veg-
etables, but another key to follow-
ing these guidelines is patience. We
didn't get fat overnight, and we're
not going to slim down that quickly
either. Healthy, long-lasting weight
loss takes time, and the way to do it
successfully is gradually.
The second key tenet to the 2010
Dietary Guidelines points to con-
suming nutrient-rich foods. This
is a vague recommendation. At the
grocery store, it can be hard to tell
what's good for you and what's
not, especially since the Food and
Drug Administration doesn't regu-
late everything that manufacturers
write on their products.
These nutrient-rich foods
include fruit, vegetables, whole
grains, low-fat dairy, seafood, lean
meat, eggs, beans and nuts. Notice-
ably, these are all mostly "whole"
foods, rather than a compendium
of artificial ingredients. This is
encouraging, though on the whole,
the guidelines would have done
well to push for a more environ-
mentally friendly diet.:
What could the guidelines have
included? New York Times col-
umnist Mark Bittman thought
"The Omnivore's Dilemma" author
EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS:

Michael Pollan's slogan would have
been a good place to start: "Eat
food. Not too much. Mostly plants."
Unfortunately, Pollan's manifesto is
still a bit unrealistic for many of us.
As a nation, we're not quite ready
- though we should be - to fully
embrace a plant-based diet.
Simplicity can
help promote
healthy eating.
Nonetheless, exposure to this
idea is the only way to convince
Americans that eating less meat is a
relevant endeavor. The fact that the
guidelines are only issued every five
years becomes important - though
Americans aren't yet willing to
embrace the idea of eating "mostly
plants," repeating this mantra is one
way to work towards its eventual
acceptance.
The guidelines had the potential
to introduce this idea in a relatively
small way. There's a growing move-
ment called "Meatless' Mondays"
that encourages Americans to take
a break from meat once a week.
The program is run in association
with the Johns Hopkins' Bloomberg
School of Public Health. It's a very
gradual reduction in meat consump-
tion, but the end result hopes to get
Americans to consume 15 percent
less meat. The goal isn't just person-
al health - for the Meatless Mon-
day folks, the planet's health is just
as important. In an ideal world, the
2010 Dietary Guidelines would have
endorsed this program or created
one like it.

Protect NPR, it protects us

In the weeks and months following Sept. 11,
Americans turned to National Public Radio by
the millions. It was a scary time, and people
needed trustworthy information and analysis
as they struggled to make sense of something
that seemed senseless.
So worthy of respect was their coverage
in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks that
many of the new listeners NPR gained in 2001
became committed new fans, and 9/11 became
a turning point for public radio. Over the last
decade, as the audience for nearly every other
traditional news source has sharply declined,
NPR saw its audience grow 50 percent- with
nearly 30 million listeners of every political
affiliation now tuning in every week and mil-
lions more downloading NPR podcasts.
Yet despite NPR's popularity - due to
its success at creating a product which the
American people have deemed worth fund-
ing - public radio finds itself in jeopardy. Last
week, House Republicans announced a budget
proposal that would completely eliminate the
Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which is
partially responsible for funding NPR.
I have no doubt that sharp cuts to the fed-
eral budget are necessary. The Republican
plan would slash education, pulverize the
Environmental Protection Agency, eliminate
AmeriCorps, cut funding for Great Lakes
cleanup in half and reduce nutritional support
for infants. I'm willing to accept the fact that
some of those cuts maybe necessary to get fed-
eral deficits under control.
Americans, though, cannot accept cuts to
the institutions, that allow them to check the
power of their government. The CPB, while
accounting for a laughably small portion of
the federal budget, plays an important role in
holding the government accountable. Cutting
the CPB, let aloneeliminatingitentirely, would
be fundamentally inappropriate and irrespon-
sible. That's why strict policies exist for British
lawmakers interested in adjusting the funding
of the government-supported BBC.
Admittedly, the elimination of the CPB
would not affect countless commercial media
sources. But NPR's 30 million listeners would
argue there's a significant difference between
the service provided by NPR and that of other

broadcast sources like MSNBC and Fox News.
It's a difference important enough to cause
huge numbers of private citizens to donate to
public radio stations like Michigan Radio here
in Ann Arbor.
That difference is all about trust. When I
headtothegymat5p.m.,mostofthetelevisions
are tuned to Glenn Beck's show on Fox News,
and while I find his style especially obnoxious,
my feelings apply to many of the programs on
modern cable news. They're focused on politi-
cal extremes, and like Keith Olbermann before
his departure from MSNBC, Beck concentrates
on entertaining his audience. It's an unavoid-
able condition of commercially-funded media
that he makes money, not based on the merit of
his analysis, but based on his ability to enter-
tain and retain viewers.
That's what makes NPR's business model
so special and its cause so important. NPR
reporters take home money only if they can
convince listeners their report was so well
composed, so unbiased and so important
to the general population that it warrants
a donation or a CPB grant to sustain future
reports. The built-in emphasis on qual-
ity over entertainment is what makes public
media unlike any other form of media on the
planet. The only way I manage to survive 30
minutes on a treadmill listening to Glenn
Beck is the knowledge that I'll soon climb
into my car and hear those calm, sane words,
"From NPR news in Washington..." They're
words that say, "Go ahead, Nick, make up
your own mind."
Forty years ago this April, NPR began its
broadcasts with live coverage of the Senate
hearings on the war in Vietnam. Since then,
NPR and its journalists have accumulated
hundreds of awards, including 53 George Fos-
ter Peabody Awards. Far more importantly,
though, it has gained the trust of the American
people as an even-handed source for news and
analysis. For 40 years, as an independent gov-
ernment watchdog and source of top-quality
journalism, NPR has been protecting our free-
doms through its reporting. Now it's our turn
to protect NPR.
Nicholas Clift is an Engineering sophomore.

Even though it's only Febru-
ary, it's been a pretty good
year for
agriculture.
Wait, wait:
Don't stop read-
ing yet. I know
many of you are
thinking, "Farm-
ing? Cows? Bor-
ing!" But this
farming stuff is RACHEL
really important VAN GILDER
in Michigan.
And in the past
couple of months, Michigan agricul-
ture has finally started to getsome of
the recognition it deserves.
Farming is our state's second-
largest industry following the auto-
motive industry. The agriculture
industry employs more than 1 mil-
lion people statewide and generates
about $60 billion in economic activ-
ity, according to the Michigan State
University Product Center. Michigan
produces huge quantities of high-
quality asparagus, blueberries, black,
red and navy beans, apples and car-
rots, among a variety of other valu-
able crops. Michigan's big claim to
fame is cherries. The state produces
about 75 percent of the nation's tart
cherries, according to the Michigan
Department of Agriculture.
In a move that had champions of
agriculture like me cheering, Repub-
lican Gov. Rick Snyder recognized
agriculture's importance in his first
annual State of the State address on
Jan. 19. He asked the state Legisla-
ture to add agricultural processing
to the 21st Century Jobs Fund, a
government-based initiative started
in 2005 by former Democratic Gov.
Jennifer Granholm. It's designed to
"strengthen and diversify Michi-
gan's economic base by fostering
the creation and growth of new
jobs, new businesses and new indus-
tries" through private investments,
according to its website. If the Leg-

1grfestiva
islature agrees, the fund will invest
more money in creating agriculture
jobs in Michigan.
It's encouraging to hear Snyder
recognize the importance of agricul-
ture to the state - it's far too often
that people focused on Michigan's
automotive industry ignore the eco-
nomic powerhouse that employs
about 24 percent of the state's popu-
lation, according to the MSU Product
Center. Investing in a growing indus-
try that's already successful is sim-
ply smart business. And Snyder is, if
nothing else, a shrewd businessman.
But Snyder's nod to the agricul-
tural industry wasn't the only good
news for Michigan farmers. Fans
of the recently-canceled Michigan
State Fair also got some good news
earlier this month.
Granholm gave the State Fair's
public funding the ax in 2009. With-
out the funding, the fair wasn't able
to get off the ground in2009 or 2010.
There was talk of leasing the state
fairgrounds located in Detroit to
other organizations, but those plans
fell through. Despite its importance,
it looks like Michigan's historic State
Fair perished for good at age 160.
I lamented the loss of the State Fair
last year ((Agri)cultural celebration,
04/05/2010). Agriculture is a signifi-
cant- part of Michigan's identity, and
it deserves recognition on a state level.
The State Fair provided that recogni-
tion. When it died, an already under-
appreciated industry slipped a little
further into the background.
I also argued that if Michigan
agricultural organizations worked
together to raise private funds to
sponsor the event, they could prob-
ably bring the State Fair back to life.
I was only half right.
In early February, a coalition of
agriculture-based groups announced
that they have banded together to
create a replacement for the State
Fair: The Great Lakes Agricultural
Fair. The Agricultural Fair would

host traditional fair events such as
a farmer's market and animal judg-
ing. Organizers also plan to include
concerts from a variety of genres and
other family-friendly entertainment
like traditional fair rides.
Agriculture is a
defining aspect
of our state.
The group sponsoring the event,
which is made up of Michigan poli-
ticians and businessmen, still needs
to finish brokering deals with enter-
tainment acts and hammering out
other details. But it looks like every-
thing is moving alongsmoothly. The
event is scheduled to be held at the
Silverdome in Pontiac - which was
formerly the home of the Detroit
Lions - Sept. 2 through 5, according
to a Feb. 7 Detroit News article. The
article said Grant Reeves,- general
manager of the Silverdome, hopes
to draw more than 80,000 people to
the event. One-day admission tick-
ets are expected to cost only $8 for
adults - not an unreasonable price.
The prospect of a State Fair sub-
stitute is wonderful. Much of Michi-
gan is rural, though the woes of
Detroit discussed in the news often
make us forget that. It's only right
to take the time to come together to
celebrate this very important part of
our state's culture. The Agricultural
Fair won't be the same as the State
Fair - but it's close enough.
Agriculture is a defining aspect of

Controlling critics

COURTESY OF COLUMOIA
Easy, breezy, beautiful. Adele.
Adele matures o

On second release,
British singer comes
into her own
By CHLOE STACHOWIAK
Daily Arts Writer
In a music industry haunted by Brit-
ney Spears scandals and gimmicky
Gaga stunts, it's no wonder female
performers get such a
bum rap. Our culture
buzzes with reasons
to dismiss these art- Adele
ists as superficial or
corny - after all, how 21
seriously can you take
someone who sings Columbia
about brushing her
teeth with alcohol?
Don't be fooled by her multiple award
nominations, Grammys and frequent
VHS Radio Countdown appearances:
Adele is more than your average main-
stream artist. With her raw, honest
voice and bluesy style, the 22-year-old
singer-songwriter has usedrthe power
of her music alone to rise to the top of
pop charts. By releasing her second
album, 21, the British star has proven

once again that she has what it takes to
stand out from her peers - without the
aid of reality shows or bubble costumes.
Despite the popularity of sleazy pop
songs and overwhelming dance beats,
21's sincerity is what makes it shine.
Its earnestness is felt in "Don't You
Remember," a simple yet powerful bal-
lad of a relationship gone awry. Though
its topic and lyrics aren't revolution-
ary by any means, Adele's singing style
glosses the song with gusto. Her voice is
tinged with passion and pain, taking on
the qualities of soft and explosive tones
as she pleas for her lost lover to return.
It's a voice that makes even the most
generic "please remember me" lines
moving, resonating with any girl who
has suffered from a broken heart. As
she sings, it's tempting to find the guy
she's singing about on Facebook and
send him a meddling message to bring
the two back together - anything to
console her heartfelt wails.
Though they probably won't bring
listeners to their knees in empathy, 21's
faster tracks are just as authoritative as
"Don't You.Remembern",Numbers like
"Rollingsin=the Deeb" swing with soul
and emotional fury, creating a musi-
cal storm with chorus-style backup
vocals and jazzy instruments. The

lead vocals thunder with confidence as
Adele threatens some scumbag: "You're
gonna wish you had never met me." It's
the kind of track - bold and irresistibly
catchy - that inspires impromptu car
singing sessions, unapologetically fill-
ing the vehicle with bass and girl power.
However, not all of 21 lives up to the
vigor of "Don't You Remember" and
"Rolling in the Deep." Some tracks, like
"Lovesong," sound stale - though not
unpleasant, they just don't create the
same emotional rush as other, funkier
numbers. Still, Adele's radiant vocals
help to salvage even the least exciting
parts of the album, adding personal
touches to otherwise average tales of
heartache.
There is something to be said for
Adele's modest musical style and the
popularity it's gaining - rivaling artists
with more years of experience, more
album releases and larger wig collec-
tions. 21 is a breath of fresh, natural air
in an industry that quakes with gaudy
personas and tabloid appearances. With
its fiery vocals and punchy instrumen-
tals t.ealbum giveshope to the future.
of mainstream pop: Maybe one day
musicians will be judged solely on their
sound, not their resemblance to a Ring-
ling Brothers act.

i's become common, with a canon
of criticism so popular and abun-
dant, that film goers start to devel-
op loyalties - not so much to the films
themselves, but to the critics who make
a living reviewing
them.
You're out there
- the person who
aligns himself or
herself to a single
critic's picks and
passes as if the
critic's preference ANK'R
is their own. There SOHONI
are also those who
put much in the
critics as a whole - the ones who only
watch the Certified Fresh films on Rot-
ten Tomatoes and would rather read a
film to death than - god forbid - watch
something less than great.
Sarcasm is bitter, but in all serious-
ness, I get quickly sick of the critics.
As art goes, no, there is no rubric for
a "good" film, but critics nonetheless
wield the general stamp of approval.
And as far as my push for independence
from their influence goes, I realize their
hold on me is no weaker than their hold
on much of the film-going world. After
all, most of my articles are reviews.
In some ways, I've become part of the
monster.
But I resist. I review movies, but I
love some movies that most, if not all,
critics wouldn't exactly call top-caliber,
and while Ican identify the blocks that
build a "good" movie and judge those
for the world, Ican at the same time
avoid such a utilitarian view when
watching a film for myself. And as far
as understanding the way an artform
functions, it seems that we reviewers
overemphasize to death.
Don't forget standards - but then
again, we lose something in blindly fol-
lowing them. Those who treasure the
film experience - and not simply each
film asa narrative commodity - know
that almost every movie offers some-
thing new. I can't go back in time and
make every film "great," but while I'm
sitting in the theater, I'm not afraid to
appreciate even the mostbasic of inno-
vations - a witty few lines of dialogue
oran impressive camera shot I haven't -
seen before.'
There's a way to see beyond the'ciit-
ics. And the way ISwatch films isn't - or
shouldn't be - unique. (But I see the
irony too - don't always listen to the
film writers you read, including me.)
Popular film criticism, while present-
ed as artistic analysis, in many ways
feeds the economic hierarchy of the

film industry. In conjunction with stu-
dios, critics box in the market structure
of Hollywood, judging each film against
preconceived notions of whatthat film
should be in relationto its place in the
market. Audiences use the critics to find
the films they think best fit their idea of
preference, and then financially reward
critical suggestion. If you're looking
for a screwball comedy, the critics will
tell you which one you'll like. If you're
looking for a character-driven period
piece, the critics will steer you that way.
It sounds somewhat extreme, but we
watch what critics tell us to watch.
The function of critics in our view-
ing choices isn't unexpected or sur-
prising. Hollywood is a machine, and
much like movie marketing, critics
direct viewers. To push against that is,
to some extent, to lose touch with soci-
ety's view of the medium.
Don't always trust
critics - even me.
So, while I like to put the critics
away, there needs to be a more complex
way to manage their influence. While
it's tempting to ignore them, and also
tempting to abuse them, Ioften find it
helpful to have them in the back pocket,
but carry an awareness of an artistic
achievementbeyond them that only I
can define. And I would recommend the
same to anyone. Like any art, film is sig-
nificantly a social medium of exchange,
but is meaningless without the individ-
ual's interaction withthe work.
And that's the most important take-
awaywe can gain from examining the
critics' effect on film-going: We have
our own critical eyes that supersede
those of the critics - all we lack is the
training and the specialization to make
us think and write for others to under-
stand our standards.
We should each have our own
standards of what makes something
"good," or what makes something fit
within our expectations. The critics
know what they like, and they'll tell
you; in the end, avoiding panned films
like "Th'&Roo inmate" will ptobably
save you money and sanity. Buts don't
use critics as your own critical mind.
When it comes to your entertainment,
you know more than them.

'Big Mommas,' small laughs

By STEPHEN OSTROWSKI
Deputy Magazine Editor
The conditions under which a sentient
moviegoer might enjoy John Whitesell's
("Deck the Halls") laughable "Big Mom-
mas: Like Father, Like
Son" are so few - like
if he or she does not
value time, money or Big Mommas:

- that humor would Like Father,
be better served Like Son
cuing up 107 minutes
of Lolcats, FACEin- AtQualityl6
HOLE and other and Rave
quickly fossilizing 20th Century Fox
Internet memes.
In this third and
hopefully final installment of the "Big
Momma" tour-de-cinematic foible, FBI
agent Malcolm Turner (Martin Law-
rence, "Death at a Funeral") is caught in
an unfunny pickle after stepson Trent
(Brandon Jackson, "Lottery Ticket") wit-
nesses a murder at a botched sting opera-
tion. As is the obvious witness protection
protocol, the duo does the gender shuf-
fle - Lawrence suiting up as franchise
namesake Big Momma and Jackson as
his (her?) grand-niece, Charmaine - and
relocate to an all-girls art school, where
they snoop around for a piece of evidence
to lock up the murderers from the sting-
gone-bad. Cue an unwanted barrage of
genital jokes, archetypal family bonding
and a regrettable taste in your mouth.
Unsurprisingly, no amount of artifice
is sufficient to mask the story's pain-
ful lack of imagination and effort. The
once-magnetic Lawrence, a la Adam
Sandler and Mike Myers, joins the ranks
of aged funnymen refusing to surren-
der their dulling comedy crowns. The
fresh-faced Jackson gives an equally
dry performance, and even a brief open-
ing cameo from Ken Jeong (Ken Jeong!
Of "The Hangover" and "Community"
fame!) doesn't give the film its badly

needed comedic zest.
The supporting cast is equally dimen-
sionless, with the film unsuccessfully
relying on stock characters to resusci-
tate a wheezing narrative. These include
brooding-but-bumbling and fashionably
streamlined criminals, a smooth-talking
and lovable janitor and a shallowly pack-
aged female student populace presum-
ably designed to let the leads shine.
If you were going
to see this film,
Chang your mind.
Admittedly, Lawrence's slapstick -
though largely infantile lest you enjoy
gender-confused punchlines - is a
somewhat fresh departure from the bro-
y, Apatowian humor infecting recent
cinema (irreverent cultural references
behind thick wire rims can lose their

zing). However, there are too few oppor-
tunities for Lawrence to salvage the slop-
py semblance of contrived storylines. Not
that Lawrence is a Brando reincarnate
- but half-baked subplots that weakly
broach the crime comedy and young love
genres, paired with the endlessly recy-
cled "he's a she" arc, are too much for Big
Momma's prosthetic shoulders to carry.
Which brings the unavoidable, popu-
lar question for Hollywood bombs: Who
greenlit this film? To be sure, the first
two "Big Momma" flicks both grossed
well over $100 million worldwide, so it's
logical to assume - quality be damned
- that the third effort would be equally
bankable. But at some point the sanc-
tity of a franchise, even if it hinges on
a glistening fat suit, should be halted
in the name of creative integrity. Like
"Little Fockers" and "Saw nth" before
it, "Like Father, Like Son" is another
erosive blow to a slowly dying, margin-
ally amusing franchise. Somewhere, the
rightfully euthanized Mrs. Doubtfire -
though hardly the zeitgeist of cinema -
unsoundly turns over in her grave.

understated instru- Asobi SekSU
mentals of Volcano
Choir: Experimental Fluorescence
bands keep the music polyvinyl
scene stimulating.
It's easy to be drawn
in by their inventiveness, which chal-
lenges mainstream music with eccentric
sounds and pushes expectations into
new territory. After all, when was the
last time someone listened to Animal
Collective without being hypnotized by
its offbeat melodies and effects?
Some experimental
bands are engaging.
Not this one.
Then there's Asobi Seksu. With
strange, fluttery female vocals and unfo-
cused instrumentals, the band's new
album, Fluorescence, has little in com-,
mon with most of music that pumps
though our speakers - but not necessar-
ily in a positive way.
The album starts promisingly with
"Coming Up" as drum beats and the
light, choppy vocals of Yuki Chikudate
fall gently against a stronger synthe-
sizer line. Guitars and male vocals soon
join, weaving together a diverse, irre-

sistibly upbeat song. It's an intoxicating
crescendo of sounds, trance-like and
delicate while underlined with firmer
electronic melodies.
This, however, is where the dream-
pop magic ends. While the layers of
"Coming Up" float effortlessly, the
rest of Fluorescence isn't as cohesive -
instead, it's clunky, scattered and just
doesn't make sense.
"Trails" is one of many unsuccessful
numbers, as its multiple elements strike
against each other awkwardly for the
length of the four-minute track. Fuzzy
guitars are covered by keyboards and
messy drum crashes, creating a clatter
of sounds instead of the smooth, intri-
cate ones heard at the beginning of the
album. It's an obnoxious, muddled mess
that generates more confusion than
actual enjoyment.
Matters are only made worse when
Chikudate begins to sing. Though she
clearly has a strongvoice, it is too strong
for the already chaotic tracks. She over-
whelms the songs with powerful notes
- both on- and off-key - and fails to
carry an actual melody at any point. As

Less 'Biutiful' the fourth time

lnsrritu brings tired themes of death and
suffering to newest Bardem film
By Timothy Rabb I Daily Arts Writer

After a landmark career as
the first Mexican director to be
nominated for .an Oscar, having
three critically
acclaimed films
and a signifi-
cant following Biutiful
in several coun-
tries, Alejandro At the State
Gonzalez Sfiar-
ritu has come Focus
full circle with
"Biutiful." But it's not one of
those good circles that round out
a standout filmography. It's an
endless cycle of death, despera-
tion and despondency that runs
the same tedious course with no
hope of divergence.
Just like he did with the
monolithic skyscrapers of
Mexico City, the desert plains
of Morroco and the crowded
streets of urban Japan, Ifisrritu
underscores every sordid corner
of Barcelona and drains his cin-
ematic world of all natural light.
A murky haze hangs in the air,
no one smiles, prayers are never
answered, babies cry perpetu-
ally and no cloud has even a hint

of silver lining.:
Uxbal (Javier Bardem, "No
Country for Old Men") is a devot-
ed father of two and the dis-
graced husband of a prostitute.
He lives week to week by hustling
working immigrants and bribing
cops to look the other way. When
he learns that he has an aggres-
sive form of cancer that will kill
him in only two months, he races
to get his affairs in order and find
his children a more suitable care-
taker than their birthmother.
Even before he knows his life's
deadline, Uxbal is a burdened
man. His bipolar wife refuses Sadder than Sad Keanu.

whom the universe has a brutal a dark ceiling. The picturesque
vendetta, and we pay ten dollars imagery is a graceful comple-

ment to a well composed film.
But this pastel of cinematic
devices would be better suited
to paint a Corot landscape than
a Kevorkian death poster.
The irony of the grim premise
is already obvious before see-
ing the movie. Sfirritu's first
three films - "Amores Perros,"
"21 Grams" and "Babel" - were
part of what was referred to as
the "Death Trilogy," a riveting
depiction of death and its conse-

quences. So how to take his lat-
est story in a new direction? The
simple answer is, with new char-
acters and a new setting. It's hard
to use the whole "companion
piece" exemption to defend the
familiar themes that ruin "Biuti-
ful" and waste Bardem's acting
chops. Really, the whole affair
is a melodramatic "Saw" install-
ment, except in lieu of average
feature length you'll get to cringe
for two-and-a-half hours.

SEKSU
From Page 5.
she whines that her "baby
doesn't love (her) anymore" and
how confused this makes her feel
in bizarre pitches and scales, it's
difficult to feel sympathetic. It
might be a more natural reaction
to ask, "What the hell was that?"
The rest of the tracks are just
as puzzling. Though the instru-
mentals are pleasing in places -
like the electrifying synthesizer
in "In My Head" or the psyche-
delic keyboard of "Deep Weird
Sleep" - there is a disjointed
feeling in the songs as a whole.
Some parts shine individually
but are thrown together in a
thoughtless way, each competing
to be the tracks' center of focus.
When paired with the overpow-
ering coos and strange tones of
the vocals, the album sounds
more like noise than music; it's
a frenzied static of instruments
lacking a cleargoal or melody.
While Asobi Seksu describes
its music as "experimental
dream pop," it's frightening
to imagine the kind of dream
this album describes. Garbled
in its messy sounds and irritat-
ing vocals, Fluorescence would
be a better soundtrack to a
drug-induced panic attack than
the gentle waves of the REM
cycle. There might just be a line
between experimental music
and white noise; if so, Asobi
Seksu has stumbled over it with
clumsy, cumbersome strides.

ated standards like peer reviews
of faculty members' perfor-
mances.
"Long-term, I think what we
need to do is come up with a
standard that we have control
over," Rothman said.
He added that since faculty
members have no control over
fluctuations in. the economy,
tenure shouldn't be determined
by economically-driven fac-
tors such as obtaining research
grants or publishing materials.
According to an e-mail Han-
Ion sent to faculty members on
Friday, the proposal was made
available for public comment
yesterday. The SACUA members
present at yesterday's discussion
agreed that public commentary
is important for moving forward
with changes to tenure stan-
dards.
"It is really important for fac-
ulty to respond to the provost's
call for comments," Poe said.
In the e-mail, Hanlon wrote
that he hopes to bring the pro-
posal to the University Board of
Regents for a vote this spring.
If the regents vote in favor

of the proposal to change the
bylaw, it wouldn't alter the abil-
ity of the governing faculty at
any school or college to decide
to change the tenure probation-
ary period in any school or col-
lege.
Medical School faculty mem-
bers spoke in favor of the pro-
posal at the regents' monthly
meeting last Thursday. The
Medical School, Ross School of
Business, School of Dentistry,
School of Education and Taub-
man College of Architecture
and Urban Planning are the only
schools and colleges that cur-
rently use the full eight years for
tenure probationary periods.
Rothman said yesterday that
Medical School faculty mem-
bers are in favor of changing the
bylaw because they lack the time
needed to meet requirements for
tenure.
"I contend that that's not a
problem - that's the symptom
of a problem," Rothman said.
"The symptom of the problem
is what's being treated with the
changing of 5.09."
Poe and Rothman's short-
term solutions would allow each
faculty member to choose to
extend his or her tenure proba-
tionary period twice for reasons

like pregnancy or illness.
Rothman said lengthening
the period for all faculty mem-
bers would be a disservice to
many because not making ten-
ure after 10 years could damage
to a career or delaytheir plans to
raise a family.
"Waiting 10 years is cruel and
unusual punishment," Rothman
said.
Kim Kearfott, SACUA mem-
ber and Engineering profes-
sor, said Poe's counterproposal
could help all faculty members.
"The idea of transparent and
ubiquitously applicable, flexible
tenure clock stoppage - a policy
like that - is something that is
potentially beneficial to every-
one across the campus," Kear-
fott said.
Poe said she thinks other uni-
versities will follow suit if the
changes suggested in her coun-
terproposal are implemented.
However, Rothman said the
University should be concerned
with maintaining standards of
excellence and attracting new
faculty in lieu of the imminent
retirement of many baby-boom-
ers.
"We should be worried about
getting new faculty," Rothman
said.

TENT CITY
From Page 1
munity to move multiple times
in the past, first from the woods
behind Toys 'R' Us at Arborland
Mall, then to an area of public
land near 1-94 off Ann Arbor-
Saline Road and finally to its
current location, where kCTN has
been based since last May.
The idea for CTN was based
on a homeless living community
that began in Seattle, Wash. in
the 1990s. The name Camp Take
Notice refers to the residents'
hope that they will be recog-
nized as human beings, rather
than having camp itself be rec-
ognized.
"What we are saying is take
notice of the situation ...," camp
resident Nate Williams said.-
"First of all, take notice that the
problem of homelessness isn't
going away. Take notice that
there is a big gap in services that
are being provided compared to
what should be provided."
The camp is a self-governing
organization in which resi-
dents have assigned roles. Camp
responsibilities include main-
taining security, keeping track
of donations and serving on
an executive committee that
determines if a resident should
be kicked out of the camp for
infractions such as drug or alco-
hol use or the threat of violence.
Besides camp duties, camp
residents' work daily, seek work
outside of the camp or look into
disability benefits and other
social services. Current CTN
residents said the average stay at
the tent city is a period of several
months, though residents will
occasionally stay within the tent
community for more than a year.
CTN co-founder Caleb Poirier,
who spent time in a Seattle tent
community, said one of the best
benefits of living in the camp is
the relationships he developed.
"Having friendships ... that.
is why I am excited at this as
a model," Poirier said. "Often

times when you are in this situ-
ation, you are in it by yourself.
There is not an easy accessed
social community for people
who are on the bottom of soci-
ety."
Poirier added that the feeling
of being accepted by a commu-
nity often draws people to tent
cities.
Brian Nord, president of the
Michigan Itinerant Shelter
System Interdependent Out of
Necessity (MISSION) - a non-
profit group that supports CTN
- said the relationships formed
in the community help residents
handle hardships they're facing.
"The folks have dedicated
themselves, at least for the time
they are there, to take care of
each other," Nord said. "The
social connections are one of the
things that keep these people
alive."
With official non-profit sta-
tus, MISSION facilitates funding
and advocates on behalf of CTN.
MISSION assists in communica-
tion between the camp and the
surrounding communities, along
with helping camp residents
take advantage of the social ser-
vices offered to them.
"We're making these incre-
mental steps to help folks live
more safely (and) a little bit more
comfortably so they can focus on
other things," Nord said.
He said people's ignorance
of what homeless individuals
to experience fuels misunder-
standing of homeless communi-
ties.
"The misconception is that
they just want to live off what-
ever the system is willing to give
them," Nord said. "They're list-
less, have no sense of direction
and have no interest in being a
positive part of society.'
Jeffrey Albanese, a graduate
student in the University's joint
doctoral program of anthropol-
ogy and social work, has sat on
the board of MISSION and stud-
ied tent communities. He said
media coverage too frequently
portrays tent cities as growing in

number or appearing because of
the recession.
"There are a number of tent
cities that predate the recession
by a decade or more," Albanese
said. "These sort of things hap-
pen in good economic times and
bad."
Albanese added that he feels
it is important to recognize the
diversity of the causes behind
the creation of tent cities. Some
tent cities tarise because home-
less individuals are frustrated
with the way they have been
treated by shelter' "a lack of
low-income housing.
In the case of CTN, residents
were careful to note that they
appreciated the work Washt-
enaw County's Robert J. Delo-
nis Center does, yet they wish
people noticed the lack of low-
income housing in Washtenaw
County,
The Delonis Center is the
main resource for single, home-
less adults and links individuals
with social services, according
to Ellen Schulmeister, the execu-
tive director of the Shelter Asso-
ciation of Washtenaw County.
The Delonis Center offers beds
year round and expands its offer-
ings during the winter months.
However, the availability of beds
doesn't always meet the demand.
Schulmeister said she believes
housing prices in Washtenaw
County are higher than in neigh-
boring counties, which increases
the problem of homelessness
here.
"There are never enough ser-
vices for everybody no matter
where people live," she said. "I
believe the tent city has the same
goal that we have, which is to get
people housed."
Living outside in tents is a
long way from a permanent solu-
tion, Schulmeister said.
"To me, the only perma-
nent option is housing. There
wouldn't be a tent city if we had
enough housing,"-she-said. "The
problem. is that the money is
going away faster than we know
what to do."

cy from gathering data on indus-
trial greenhouse gas emissions,
controlling greenhouse gases
released by stationary sources
and increasing gasoline's ethanol
amount from 10 to 15 percent.
The origins of the GLRI
stretch back to 2004 when for-
mer President George W. Bush
issued an executive order for the
EPA and other federal agencies
to form the Great Lakes Inter-
agency Task Force to coordinate
and prioritize restoration efforts
in the Great Lakes region.
In 2010, when Obama
announced he would allocate
$475 million to jumpstart the
GLRI, the work done by the
IATF over the previous five
years translated into an EPA-led,
interagencyinitiative thatwould
target the most critical prob-
lems in the Great Lakes region,
including invasive aquatic spe-
cies, non-point source pollution
and contaminated sediment.
Jennifer Read, assistant
director and research coor-
dinator for the Michigan Sea
Grant - a partnership between
the University of Michigan
and Michigan State University
aimed at conserving the Great
Lakes - said in an interview
last week that she anticipated
that the U.S. House would most
likely pass the Continuing Reso-
lution by the end of the week.
"I would say the budget cuts

to a digital copy of essentially
every bound published work in
our libraries within a couple of
years," Courant said.
Though it is difficult to gauge
the exact progress of the digiti-
zation process, Courant said he
doesn't think the University is
more than two years away from
completing the first phase of the
digitization.
Since the start of the Google
Books Library Project, the Uni-
versity has been in the process
of building a collective digital
library called HathiTrust Digi-
tal Library that uses books made
digital by Google. HathiTrust,
which is a collaboration with
52 other libraries, is part of
the development of the largest
library in the world, according
to Courant. The University was
one of the first institutions to
work with Google on the proj-
ect along with Stanford Univer-
sity, Harvard University, Oxford
University and the New York
Public Library.
The Google Books Library
Project intends to digitize all
bound materials from the Uni-
versity's main library system,
as well as those of the William
L. Clements Library, Bentley
Historical Library, Law Library
and the Kresge Business Admin-
istration Library. In total 8 mil-
lion volumes will be digitized,
according to Courant.
Ben Bunnell, manager of
Library Partnerships for Google
Book Search, wrote in an e-mail

that so far Google has digitized
more than 15 million books,

we're looking at are not unex-
pected, but they're still sort of...
short-sighted because of what it
is we're turning down in train-
ing the next generation of scien-
tists, understanding restoration
science better, faster and restor-
ing our natural resource base
here, which is going to be the
basis of our next economy," she
said.
No current Michigan Sea
Grant projects will be affected
by federal budget cuts, Read
said. Having received $1.5 mil-
lion from the GLRI, the Michi-
gan Sea Grant is currently
leading two restoration projects.
The Green Marina Education
and Outreach project focuses on
reducing pollution by develop-
ing better training instruments
for people partaking in boat-
ing and marina activities. The
Restoring Native Fish Habitat
in the St. Clair River project
aims to increase spawning areas
fpr native fish species in the St.
Clair River, according to Read,
who is a co-principal investiga-
tor on the St. Clair River project.
The Michigan Sea Grant is
also collaborating on five other
projects funded by the GLRI,
including one aimed at con-
taining the spread of invasive
aquatic species and another
monitoring beach contaminants
through laser technology.
While these initiatives will
continue, Read said, budget cuts
will take a toll on future GLRI
endeavors to investigate unex-
plored issues in restoration sci-

ence.
"(Restoration science) requires
a lot of adaptive management -
that is, being able to monitor and
understand what's happening
in the result of your restoration
activity and tweak it as you need
to and follow up in later years,
so having less dollars to do that
activity means ... we're able to do
less," she said.
The Continuing Resolution -
known as H.R. 1 - is an indica-
tion of the strong anti-spending
sentiment among the Republi-
can majority in the House. The
bill needs to pass in the U.S. Sen-
ate and then be signed by Obama
to be turned into law. The feder-
al government is at risk of shut-
ting down if an appropriations
bill isn't passed by March 4.
After the bill passed in the
House on Saturday, Hal Rogers
(R-KY), chair of the U.S. House
Appropriations Committee,
expressed his firm support for
the bill in a statement that day.
The bill passed with a 235-189
majority and addresses the need
for the nation to reduce its defi-
cit.
"We held no program harm-
less from our spending cuts,
and virtually no area of gov-
ernment escaped this process
unscathed," he wrote in the
statement. "While these choic-
es were difficult to make, we
strived to spread the sacrifice
fairly, weeding out waste and
excess, with a razor-sharp focus
on making the most out of every
tax dollar."


which accounts for nearly 10
percent of books across the
globe. Google aims "to scan just
about all of the world's books"
and will continue on its quest by
pursuing further collaborations,
Bunnell wrote.
"Since we're scanning col-
lections from so many libraries,
all students are able to benefit
from multiple library collections
directly, whether their own
institution is a direct participant
in the project or not," Bunnell
wrote.
In addition to more typical
texts, Google has been working
with NASA to digitize aeronau-
tical material, according to Bun-
nell.
To make information more
accessible, some of the fully
readable digitized texts have
been converted to an electronic
publication, or EPUB, which
allows for the text to be read on
digital readers such as Kindle
and E-Book, Courant said.
"Basically, you'll be able to
carry the library around in your
pocket," he said.
University students will also
have the option to print course-
packs for classes using the digi-
tized library collections after
copyright concerns are resolved.
Courant said he believes this
option will be available within
the next few years. Addition-
ally, he said he thinks people
will eventually choose to view
the coursepacks on their mobile
devices like iPads and iPhones
and only print certain sections
they want in paper form.
Courant said he believes
access for students to older
works of literature will improve
with the digitization of library

collections, as well as provide an
efficient method of record keep-
ing for collections.
"I think it makes the printed
literature of the 20th century
able to compete for student
attentionconthe same terms
as the new literature, which is
born digital, and I think that's
extremely important because
there's a remarkable amount of
very important work that was
done in the past," he said.
The complete digitization of
library collections is the most
significant technological change
for libraries to date, Courant
said.
"I really think (it) is the big-
gest transformation in the work
of libraries ever," he said.
But not all the volumes are
currently readable because of
problems with copyright law,
according to Courant.
The Google Books Library
Project is in the midst of a class
action lawsuit with the Authors
Guild regarding issues with
copyrights. The lawsuit was
initially filed against Google
in 2005. The case has yet to be
settled in court, according to
Bunnell.
"It's a class action, so the
court has to approve any settle-
ment proposed by the parties,"
Bunnell wrote. "The parties
have in fact proposed a settle-
ment, but the judge has not
approved it yet."
This is the only lawsuit
regarding copyright laws with
which the project is currently
involved, Bunnell added.
"We are confident that Google
Books is fully compliant with
U.S. and international copyright
law," he wrote.

Lack of 3-pointers doesn't
mean lack of offense for Blue

BASEBALL
New bat rules could
lower home run total

By LUKE PASCH
Daily Sports Writer.
Nearly three weeks ago, in
Columbus, the Michigan men's
basketball team shot 19 3-point-
ers in a 62-53 loss to then-No. 1
Ohio State. It was the first time
since mid-December and just the
third time all season the Wol-
verines attempted fewer than 20
shots from beyond the arc.
Then, in the four subsequent
games - against Penn State,
Northwestern, Indiana and
Illinois - the team shot 19, 15,
15 and 18 triples, respectively.
But in Saturday's 75-72 win at
Iowa, Michigan returned to its
shooting-happy form, firing 20
3-pointers.
Every team knows the rap on
Michigan coach John Beilein's
offense - be wary of his shoot-
ers. He runs a guard-heavy sys-
tem, and the only player hesitant
to launch one from 3-point terri-
tory is his center.
And at the beginning of Big
Ten play, that seemed like the
perfect offense for the Wolver-
ines. As an undersized, under-
experienced and relatively
unathietic squad, it provided
the opportunity for upsets. If
the team was shooting well on a
given night, it had the potential
to beat pretty much any team in
the nation.
Better yet, the system gave
Beilein's frontcourt contingent
- one of the youngest groups of
forwards in the nation - time
to develop. The big men were
used sparingly enough that
they weren't consistently pres-
sured to score in the paint, but
they were active enough for the
offense to avoid becoming com-
pletely one-dimensional.
So, why the sudden change
lately?
Well, against the Buckeyes,
the Wolverinep didn't haveamuch
of a choice. Ohio State coach
Thad Matta drew up a master-
ful defensive gameplan, and his
players executed it well for 40

ERIN KIRKLAND/Daily
Redshirt freshman forward Jordan Morgan has been an important part of Michigan's success in the paint this season.

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Writer
They say chicks dig the long
ball.
The chicks, then, must have
loved when former Wolverine first
baseman Mike Dufek hit a walk-
off solo home run last year against
Northwestern to complete one of
the most improbable comebacks in
Michigan baseball history. Down
14 runs after three innings, Michi-
gan rode four home runs to a 15-14
victory. The comeback was shock-
ing, to say the least.
What's equally as shocking is
that had the game been played
a year later, Dufek's blast might
never have left the park.
Effective this season, the NCAA
has imposed strict new standards
for the metal bats used in colle-
giate play. According to sophomore
centerfielder Patrick Biondi, Mich-
igan coach Rich Maloney told the
team that the NCAA expects home
run totals to be cut in half.
The standards, announced in
2008, are partially in response to
an increase in offensive numbers
in the past five years. The NCAA
citeda41-percentincrease inhome
runs per game from 2006 to 2009
as evidence that bat technology
has beenimprovingtoo rapidly..
According to a news release on
the NCAA's website, "The goal is
for non-wood bats that meet this
new standard to perform similarly
to wood bats."
The main issue the NCAA's
Batted Ball Coefficient of Restitu-
tion certification addresses is the
trampoline-like effect of modern
metal bats by measuring and limit-
ing a bat's "bounciness." Normally,
when a baseball meets a bat, the
ball compresses and in the process
loses some energy. Butnewer com-
posite bats only have a thin outer
layer of metal that compresses
instead, springing the ball forward
like a trampoline.
Michigan is ateam with little
power to begin with. Aside from
junior designated hitter Coley
Crank, who had 14 home runs last
year, the rest of the team's return-

ing players totaled just 13 home
runs all last season. The Wolver-
ines don't have much power to lose.
But their lack of dependence
on home runs can actually be an
advantage. Unlike teams who rely
heavily on the long ball, Michigan
does not stand to lose much offen-
sive production from the new bats.
"These bat standards couldn't
have come at a better time," senior
second baseman Anthony Toth
said. "We are a small-ball team.
Coach has always preached that.
It really plays into our hands really
well. We have a lot of speed, we
have good defense, we're going to
have solid pitching, and the bats
are going to play intoour favor."
Even for a small-ball team, the
new bats require an even more
intense focus on fundamentals.
Maloney said the team has put in
extra work this offseason on things
like bunts, steals and hit-and-runs.
With more emphasis on funda-
mentals, the Wolverines will have
to clean up their play in the field.
While normally solid defensively,
Michigan committed six costly
errors in three games during the
Big Ten/Big East Challenge last
weekend.
The average of two errors per
game almost doubles the Wol-
verines' average from last season.
But the team can look to improve
as they get more game experience
outdoors.
Of course, the overall formula
for success in baseball remains
unchanged: timely hitting, defense
and, most importantly, pitching.
Redshirtsophomore pitcher Bobby
Brosnahan said he doesn't plan on
changing the way he attacks hit-
ters.
"You've been doing it your
whole life, you pitch the same
way," Brosnahan said. "But I think
pitchers are goingto be able to get
away with more. Hanging curve-
balls aren'tgoingto be hit500 feet.
It's still going to get out of the yard,
but ldon't thinkyou'regoingtoasee
as many balls fly outcof the yard if
they don't really square it up."
The chicks may not dig that, but
the pitchers certainly will.

minutes of basketball.
"They had a great gameplan
to try and take our shooters
away from it and try to sag off
our big men," sophomore point
guard Darius Morris said after
the game. "(Ohio State forward
Jared) Sullinger was at the hole
just waiting for me if I did break
down the defense. And then,
they had good ball pressure on
me. They really wanted to take
our shooters out of the game and
make us dribble drive."
The Wolverines were caught
off guard and mustered just
53 points against the Buckeye
defense.
Beilein knew that teams
would start watching the game
film from Value City Arena ear-
lier this month. As opponents
started keying in on the perim-
eter shooters, his post players
would have to grow up quickly,
and the guards would have to
start penetrating instead of
swinging the ball around the
perimeter.

They did just that.
As defenders spread out to
the arc, lanes started opening
up inside. Junior guards Zack
Novak and Stu Douglass, and
even sophomore Matt Vogrich,
started executing on backdoor
cuts to the hoop. And if they
were ever stopped in the key by
a post defender coming up from
help-side, redshirt freshman
center Jordan Morgan was often
left open in the paint.
Indeed, Morgan has benefited
on the offensive end - he's aver-
aged nearly 14 points over the
five games since that matchup in
Columbus.
"A lot of times, offensive suc-
cess comes from the game plan
from the opposing team," assis-
tant coach Bacari Alexander said
after Morgan scored 27 points
against Northwestern. "Today,
we saw a situation where Jordan
Morgan was rolling to the basket
and they elected to stay with our
shooters. What ended up hap-
pening was Jordan was open

with so many opportunities at.
the rim."
Perhaps most surprising was
the success Michigan found
underneath at Illinois last week.
Though the Wolverines lost,
54-52, they actually outscored
the Fighting Illini in the paint,
36-34. And considering some
of the home team's premiere
frontcourt talent - 7-foot-1
senior Mike Tisdale and 6-foot-9
seniors Mike Davis and Bill Cole
- that feat should not go unno-
ticed.
It's possible, then, that Beilein
now is feeling bittersweet about
getting swept by the Buckeyes
this season. It never feels great
to lose to a hated rival, but
thanks to Ohio State, this Michi-
gan squad has learned to balance
its outside shooting and driving
much more effectively.
With three games left in the
regular season and an NCAA
Tournament berth on the line,
Beilein and his team found that
balance atjust the right time.

WRESTLING
Wrestling through adversity,
Biondo pursues championship

Just over a month ago, I
wrote a column about the
Michigan hockey team's
irrelevance on the national
scene. It was sitting in second
place behind
Notre Dame
in the CCHA,
but it still
hadn't shown
me anything.
If you
wantedto
have a conver- MARK
sation about BURNS
the Wolver-
ines possibly
competing for a national title this
season, Iwouldhavetoldyou,
"Sorry, butcthisteam just doesn't
have it in them. Maybe next year
Red Berenson will win his third
NCAA title."
"You hope to peak atthe right
time," senior forward Louie Capo-
russo added on Jan. 13. "You want
to stay positive obviously, and you
want to say thatthe team is head-
ed in the rightdirection. I mean,
that's the obvious answer.
"The real answer will lie in
what we do from here on out. I
mean, you can speculate and you
can predict that you think your
team is going inthe rightdirec-
tion, but it's notgoing to do much
if you're not making that happen."
Following those comments,
Michigan swept four of five con-
ference series - three of which
have come in the friendly confines
of Yost Ice Arena. During that
stretch, Berenson has received
stellar goaltending from senior
Shawn Hunwick, and barring any
season-ending injury, it looks like
Michigan will ride the Sterling
Heights, Mich. native forthe rest
of the season.
Some of Michigan's big guns
have also resurfaced, with the
likes of sophomores Chris Brown
and Kevin Lynch combining for

Michigan coach Red Berenson has Michigan ranked second in the CCHA.

eightgoals in that time span.
So, in a sense, Michigan is going
in the right direction. But there's
just one slight issue - defense.
Don't get me wrong. At times
this season, Michigan's team
defense has been pretty solid.
Just ask the world-record setting
crowd in attendance at The Big
Chill. The Wolverines currently
rank 10th nationally, allowing just
2.38 goals per game.
But despitethe their success in
the past six weeks, it seems that
during every press conference, the
comments aboutplaying better
defensively surface.
This past Friday, after Michi-
gan's 6-3 win over Western Michi-
gan, Berenson called a few of the
Broncos' goals "too easy," and
added thatthe team mighthave
been a little too relaxful in its own
end.
And it's not just coming from
the coachingcstaff - the players
are beingcandid and calling a
spade a spade.
"We emphasized tightening
it up a little bit," junior defense-
man Greg Pateryn said following
Friday's game. "We were too loose
after the second period. They got
17 shots there in the second, and

we wanted to focus on defense and
keep as many chances out as we
could."
You could pinpoint other areas
of the Michigan hockeyteam and
possibly say, "Hey, the power play
has been hit or missfor most of the
season. That's where the Wolver-
ines need the most work."
Or how about, "They still don't
have a super-star player who can
take over any game at the drop of
a hat."
No, the fact still remains: more
attentionto detail in the defensive
zone and abetter awareness of
the opposing players on the ice
will bring Michigan into national
contention. The Wolverines are
clearly headed in the right direc-
tion. To sayanything else would
be downright wrong. A few
tweaks here and there with the
defensive mindset of the team, and
you could be purchasing just a few
more postseason tickets.
The road's paved, and the car's
gassed up and ready to go.
Now it'sjust time for Michigan
to point it north to St. Paul, Min-
nesota.

On November 19, 2010 in
Bethlehem, Penn., the final 10
seconds were ticking away in
fifth-year senior captain Antho-
ny Biondo's match. Michigan
wrestling was trailing Lehigh,
but things looked bright for
Biondo - then ranked No. 8 -
who was leading 14th-ranked
Joe Kennedy.
Coming off a season in which
he finished just a win shy of All-
American status, both Biondo
and the young Wolverines could
see greatness right in front of
them.
But inside Biondo's 197-pound
frame, things weren't okay. And
suddenly, things on the mats
weren't either - Biondo's body
gave way with just three seconds
remaining.
"I was feeling horrible," Bion-
do said Monday. "I prpbably
shouldn't have wrestled, but I
wrestled and I was winning, but
I just fell apart and the kid came
back and beat me in overtime."
Showing the grittiness and
drive that earned him captain
status this season, he pushed
through the ensuing weeks until
he was forced to withdraw from
the Cliff Keen Invitationals on
Dec. 4. His forfeiture drew him
8th place, afar cry from Biondo's
usual success - he had moped up
to No. 2 nationally by then.
Biondo visited a specialist,
where he learned he was suffer-
ing from colitis - a disease that
causes the colon to swell.
"It felt like I had a really bad
sickness and I wrestled through
it all the way through the (Cliff
Keen Invitational)," Biondo said.
"For a couple of weeks, I was
having some really bad perfor-
mances ... I was diagnosed with
colitis. That was really tough."
