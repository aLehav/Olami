For first time in ten years,
women make up majority
of freshman class
By JENNIFER CALFAS
Daily Staff Reporter
With 43,710 students registered for
fall 2013, enrollment at the University
has set an all-time record for the fifth
consecutive year, according to the Office
of the Registrar. The total number of stu-
dents increased by 284 students - 0.7
percent - from the 2012 total.
Setting a record for the seventh con-
secutive year, applicants for this fall's
entering class reached 46,814, a 10 per-
cent increase from Fall 2012. Of those
applicants, the University accepted
15,570 - 19 more than in 2012 - with a
33 percent acceptance rate, more com-
petitive than last year's 36 percent accep-
tance rate.
While enrollment increased over-
all, membership across various parts of
the University varied. Undergraduate
enrollment grew by 1.1 percent to 28,283
students. The freshman class outnum-
bers the 2012 class by 54 students with
6,225 students. The number of graduate
and professional students is 15,427, a 0.1
percent change from the previous year.
For the first time in 10 years, the
freshman class consists of a 51.6-percent
majority of women. Men constitute 48.3
percent of the class, or 3,035 students.

Lester Monts, senior vice provost for
academic affairs, said in a statement that
he was impressed with the "rising cali-
ber" of this year's freshman class.
The University also holds a 97-percent
retention rate for freshmen and a 91iper-
cent six-year graduation rate, which is
33 percentage points above the national
average for four-year institutions.
Using a new federal demographic clas-
sification for the past four years, the Uni-
versityhas been able to track dataon race
and ethnicity. Under these guidelines,
the number of underrepresented minor-
ity freshmen - which include African
American, Hispanic American, Native
American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific
Islander students - saw a slight increase
10.6 percent this year, 0.6 percent more
than last year.
For the total number of students
enrolled, students who identify as white
represent the majority, with 27,399 stu-
dents, or 72.6 percent.
The next largest represented groups
in University data were Asian Ameri-
cans, African Americans, Hispanic
Americans, Native Americans and Pacif-
ic Islanders, representing 15.3 percent,
6 percent, 5 percent, 1.2 percent and 0.3
percent of the total number students,
respectively.
Enrollment data came out a day after

ments Tuesday in Schuette vs. Coalition

Students walking through the Diag
Wednesday evening heard something
different from the usual pleas from
students passing out handouts, miscel-

Student artists performed on the

This performance was the first sched-

The club, co-founded by LSA senior
Omar Hashwi and LSA sophomore
Amrutha Sivakumar - who is a Daily

Hashwi decided to bring his business

'U' alums develop app
to foster food sharing

LeftoverSwap helps
users get a meal and
reduce waste
ByEMILIE PLESSET
For the Daily
It's about as American as apple pie
- which, coincidentally, is part of the
problem.
In an effort to combat obesity issues
in the United States, University alumni
Dan Newman and Bryan Summer-
sett have launched a free iPhone app,
LeftoverSwap. The app aims to reduce
food waste and promote local eating by
allowing users to buy and sell leftover
food.
Users can advertise leftovers simply
by posting a photo of their food while
buyers can browse for nearby leftovers
and arrange for pickup or delivery.
"(The app) assuages the guilt about
not wasting any food," Newman said.
"If someone picks it up, you're rescuing
the food. On both sides of the equation
people feelgood aboutthetransaction."
The app is marketed as a way to make
a small impact in solving problems of
obesity and world hunger,,as well as a
way to grow community ties. Newman
said the app already has 4,000 users
and is gradually growing in popularity
across the country.
"The first confirmed leftover swap

happened in New York and it was the
same day we launched it," Newman
said. "The person who picked it up
said how it was probably the best bag
of chips he'd had just because it was so
rewarding."
The duo developed the concept for
the app in 2010 on a lark after graduat-
ing fronv the University. While visiting
Summersett in Seattle, Newman said
the two former roommates ordered too
much pizza for dinner and had to throw
it away.
"We thought how good of an idea it
would be to broadcast that we had this
pizza to people in the area if they want-
ed any, because otherwise it was going
to go to waste,"Newman said.
LeftoverSwap went into production
in July when a San Francisco Weekly
reporter showed interest in the concept
after discovering the website Newman
had made for the nonexistent app as an
example coding and web design proj-
ect.
"We decided we would definitely
make (the app) a real thing after all the
interest in it," he said.
While LeftoverSwap operates with
good intentions, more than a few may
be wary of eating a stranger's leftovers.
"There are people who find it totally
disgusting because food is a very per-
sonal thing, and they have a right to
be," Newman said. "Hopefully, we can
change the cultural tone towards shar-

Connecting nonprofits to support

Thirteen years after graduation,
University alum Sammy Politziner
crossed path with his old school-
mate Scott Thomas again at the
Big House in 2008, when both of
them returned for a football game
as ardent Wolverine lovers. This
led to the foundation of Arbor
Brothers, a non-profit organiza-
tion dedicated to connecting early-
stage nonprofits with potential
donors.
How did the idea of Arbor
Brothers come into being?
I became good friends with the
guy living next door to me in West
Quad freshman year. He and I led
parallel lives for the next 13 years,
graduating UM, doing Teach for

America in New York City and
working on Wall Street. In 2008,
we returned to Ann Arbor for a
football game and - inspired by
the energy on our active campus
- decided it was time to figure
out how we could "get back to
being part of the solution." We.
didn't know what form our ven-
ture would take, but we pledged
to ourselves to go out to dinner
once a week for six months with
a foundation officer, nonprofit
leader, academic or consultant to
determine where the holes in the
philanthropic landscape lay.
How does the experience at
the University contribute to
your career as nonprofit
organization founders?

Michigan has had a profound
impact on my life. From my
classes investigating our coun-
try's education system, to par-
ticipating in Alternative Spring
Break, to game day walks to the
Big House, I found the dedication
to community at Michigan both
strong and inspiring. I believe in
the high standard of becoming
a Michigan Man and I use that
metaphor as a guidepost of opti-
mism, grit and integrity. I'm still
working at it, of course, but we
named our organization after our
college town as a daily reminder
to live up to that standard.

Washington state approves
rules for pot legalization

Regulations to build
path for industry
around the world
SEATTLE (AP) - Washing-
ton adopted rules Wednesday
for the recreational sale of mari-
juana, creating what advocates
hope will be a template for the
drug's legalization around the
world.
Mexico, Uruguay, Poland
and other countries and states
already are reviewing the new
regulations, which cover every-
thing from the security at and
size of licensed marijuana gar-
dens, to how many pot stores
can open in cities across the
state, said Alison Holcomb,
the Seattle lawyer who drafted
Washington's marijuana initia-
tive.
Washington will tax pot
highly and cap total production
in the state at 80 metric tons.

Sales are expected to begin by
the middle of next year.
"We feel very proud of what
we're doing," said Sharon Fos-
ter, chairwoman of the Wash-
ington Liquor Control Board,
as she and her two colleagues
approved the rules. "We are
making history."
Washington and Colorado last
year legalized the possession of
up to an ounce of pot by adults
over 21, with voters deciding to
set up systems of state-licensed
growers, processors and sellers.
The measures put state officials
in the difficult position of craft-
ing rules for a fledgling industry
barred by federal law for more
than seven decades.
The board devised Washing-
ton's regulations after nearly
a year of research, debate and
planning, including public hear-
ings that drew hundreds of peo-
ple around the state.
Supporters hope taxed pot
will bring the state tens or hun-

dreds of millions of dollars, with
much of the revenue directed to
public health and drug-abuse
prevention.
Colorado approved its pot
industry rules last month, and
sales are expected to start in
some cities there at the begin-
ning of 2014.
The two states' laws are large-
ly similar, although Colorado
voters are considering whether
to tax marijuana at a much lower
rate, with no limit on total pro-
duction.
Colorado also will let stores
sell both recreational and medi-
cal marijuana. Both states will
require such measures as seed-
to-store tracking, background
checks for license applicants,
and child-resistant packaging.
Washington liquor. board
members said they tried to make
marijuana accessible enough
that legal pot would undermine
the black market, but not so
accessible that it would threat-

en public health or safety. The
board hopes the sale of legal
marijuana will capture about
one-quarter of the state's total
pot market, for starters.
Under the rules, the board
will issue licenses for up to 334
marijuana stores across the
7 state, with 21 of them in Seattle
- a figure some have questioned
8 as too low, considering the city
estimates about 200 medical
marijuana dispensaries already
are operating there. The City
Council has passed zoning regu-
lations for pot businesses that
would require medical marijua-
na dispensaries to obtain a state
license or stop doing business by
2015.
The rules limit the number of
licenses that anyone can hold to
three - an attempt by the board
to stamp out any monopolies
before they start. They also pro-
hibit out-of-state investment in
pot businesses and require qual-
9 m ity-control testing of marijuana
by third-party labs.

Judge to wait
for advice before
making a decision
DETROIT (AP) - Same-sex
couples queued up all afternoon
at county courthouses, some
even carrying wedding flowers.
Then a federal judge deciding
whether to throw out Michi-
gan's gay marriage ban shocked
everyone, saying simply: Wait
'til next year.
After hearing arguments
and poring over a stack of legal
briefs, U.S. District Judge Ber-
nard Friedman said Wednesday
he needs to hear from experts
on Feb. 25 before settling the
fate of a 2004 Michigan consti-
tutional amendment that rec-
ognizes marriage as being only
between a man and a woman.
"This was never a scenario
we imagined," Oakland County
Clerk Lisa Brown said. Same-
sex couples were at her office,
anxious to get a marriage
license if the judge ruled in
their favor.
"One couple has been togeth-
er for 53 years," Brown added.
"I think they've waited long
enough."

The lawsuit, brought by
Jayne Rowse and April DeBo-
er, two Detroit-area nurses in
a lesbian relationship, argues
that Michigan's constitutional
amendment violates the U.S.
Constitution's Equal Protec-
tion Clause, which forbids
states from treating people dif-
ferently. The amendment was
approved by 59 percent of vot-
ers in 2004.
Friedman clearly caught
lawyers on both sides off guard,
as they had agreed to have him
decide the issue on arguments
and briefs.
More than 100 people were
in the courtroom, anticipating
a decision in favor of gay mar-
riage, and dozens more watched
a video feed of the hearing in a
nearby room. A groan went up
in that room when Friedman
said he's not ready to make a
decision.
Thirteen states and the Dis-
trict of Columbia allow gay
marriage.
An attorney for Michigan
said the U.S. Supreme Court
has recognized that states have
authority to regulate marriage.
Kristin Heyse noted that more
than 2.5 million voters support-
ed the amendment.

"The people of the state of
Michigan should be allowed to
decide Michigan law. This is
not the proper forum to decide
social issues," Heyse, an assis-
tant attorney general, told the
judge.
Rowse, 49, and DeBoer, 42,
who have lived together for
about eight years, declined
comment outside court.
"We were all hoping for an
immediate ruling, but they
understand it's a very long pro-
cess," Dana Nessel, co-counsel
for the couple, told reporters.
Ninety miles away in Ing-
ham County, Marnee Rutledge
and Samantha Wolf were dis-
appointed, too. Rutledge had a
pink flower pinned to her shirt,
while Wolf carried a bouquet
of flowers that Rutledge gave
her when proposing earlier in
the day. They had a summer
. ceremony nearby in Holt that
wasn't legal.
"We are in our minds mar-
ried," Wolf said at the court-
house in Mason. "We had a
ceremony, we took our vows.
That we aren't afforded the
same rights as everybody who
has stood up in front of their
priest and loved ones - that's
wrong."

Detroit ends Sept.
with cash on hand
Detroit ended September with a
positive cash flow, largely because
it defaulted on many of its finan-

rupt city's emergency manager.
Inhisreporttothestatetreasur-

had anunrestricted cash balance of
about $128 million for the quarter
ending Sept. 30. The bounty mostly
was driven by the collection of
more than $237 million in summer
property taxes, he said.
Orr defaulted on $2.5 billion of
the city's unsecured debt in June,
around the time he asked credi-
tors to take pennies on the dollar
for debt owed them. An interest-

Five indicted for

Five former employees of

decades duped investors and gov-
ernment regulators, a prosecutor
said Wednesday as the workers'
criminal trial began.
"These are the people who
helped him do it," said Assistant
U.S. Attorney Matthew Schwartz,
pointing at each defendant in fed-
eral court in Manhattan. "Bernie
Madoff needed help to fool so
many people for so long.... A fraud
of this scope and duration could
not have been carried out alone."
Later, he added: "For year after

Police report dry

LAX was a 'prank'
A baggage handler arrested
after dry ice bombs exploded at

The motive was disclosed a
day after the arrest of Dicarlo
Bennett, a 28-year-old employee
for the ground handling compa-
ny Servisair.
"I think we can safely say he
is not a terrorist or an organized
crime boss. He did this for his
own amusement," said LosAnge-

Downing, who heads the depart-
ment's counter-terrorism and
special operations bureau.
No one was hurt on Sunday

when two plastic bottles packed
with dry ice exploded in an

device was found Monday night.

Greece's Parliament lifted the

on Wednesday, as part of a crack-

the fatal stabbing last month of a
Greek rapper.
Golden Dawn lawmakers
walked out before the vote, which
saw near-unanimous approval.
The government argues the
party operates as a criminal orga-
nization. Golden Dawn argues
that the case against it is politi-
cally motivated.
"I am being prosecuted for
what I believe in, and not for
my actions," Panagiotis Iliopou-
los, one of the lawmakers whose

Booker was elected to com-
plete the 15 months remaining
on the term of Frank Lauten-
berg, whose death in June at age
89 gave rise to an unusual and
abbreviated campaign. If he
wants to keep the seat for a full

six-year term - and all indica-
tions are that he does - Booker
will be on the ballot again in
November 2014.
Gov. Chris Christie, a Repub-
lican with a national following
of his own, appointed his attor-
ney general, Jeffrey Chiesa,
to the Senate temporarily and
scheduled a special election for
a Wednesday just 20 days before
Christie himself is on the ballot
seeking re-election. Christie said
he wanted to give voters a say as
soon as legally possible.
Democrats challenged the
timing, saying Christie was
afraid of appearing on the same
ballot as the popular. Booker.
But courts upheld the governor's
election schedule.
Booker had a running start
on the election. Before Lauten-
berg died, Booker passed up a
chance to run against Christie
this year, saying he was eyeing
Lautenberg's seat in 2014, in
part so he could complete a full
term as mayor - something he
won't do now that he's heading
to Washington.
He won an August primary
against an experienced Dem-
ocratic field including two
members of Congress and the
speaker of the state Assembly
in a campaign that was largely
about ideas.
The general election was
about deeper contrasts, both
ideological and personal.

Top Republicans
concede defeat in
shutdown standoff
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Up against a deadline, Con-
gress raced to pass legislation
Wednesday night to avoid a
threatened national default and
end the 16-day partial govern-
ment shutdown in the culmina-
tion of an epic political drama
that placed the U.S. economy at
risk.
The Senate passed the mea-
sure on a bipartisan margin
of 81-18 at midevening. That
cleared the way for a final,
late-night vote in the Repub-
lican-controlled House on
the legislation, which hewed
strictly to the terms President
Obama laid down when the
twin crises erupted more than
three weeks ago.
The legislation would per-
mit the Treasury to borrow
normally through Feb. 7 or per-
haps a month longer, and fund
the government through Jan.
15. More than 2 million federal
workers would be paid - those
who had remained on the job
and those who had been fur-
loughed.
At the White House, Obama
hailed the Senate's vote. Once
the measure reaches his desk,
he said, "I will sign it immedi-
ately. We'll begin reopening our
government immediately and

we can begin to lift this cloud of
uncertainty from our business-
es and the American people."
Less than an hour later, as
debate began in the House,
Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky.,
said, "After two long weeks, it
is time to end this government
shutdown. It's time to take the
threat of default off the table.
It's time to restore some sanity
to this place."
The stock market surged
higher at the prospect of an
.end to the crisis that also had
threatened to shake confidence
in the U.S. economy overseas.
Republicans conceded defeat
after a long struggle. "We
fought the good fight. We just
didn't win," conceded House
Speaker John Boehner as law-
makers lined up to vote on a
bill that includes nothing for
Republicans demanding to
eradicate or scale back Obama's
signature health care overhaul.
"The compromise we
reached will provide our econ-
omy with the stability it des-
perately needs," said Senate
Majority Leader Harry Reid,
declaring that the nation "came
to the brink of disaster" before,
sealing an agreement.
Senate Republican leader
Mitch McConnell, who nego-
tiated the deal with Reid,
emphasized that it preserved a
round of spending cuts negoti-
ated two years ago with Obama
and Democrats. As a result, he
said, "government spending

has declined for two years in a
row" for the first time since the
Korean War. "And we're not
going back on this agreement,"
he added.
Only a temporary truce, the
measure set a time frame of
early next winter for the next
likely clash between Obama and
the Republicans over spending
and borrowing.
But for now, government was
lurching back to life. In one
-example, officials met to discuss
plans for gearing back up at the
Department of Housing and
Urban Development, where 307
employees remained at work
during the partial shutdown
and more than 8,000 were fur-
loughed.
After weeks of gridlock, the
measure had support from the
White House, most if not all
Democrats in Congress' and
many Republicans fearful of the
economic impact of a default.
Boehner and the rest of the
top GOP leadership told their
rank and file they would vote
for the measure, and there
was little or no doubt it would
pass both houses and reach
the White Iouse in time for
Obama's signature before the
administration's 11:59 p.m. Oct.
17 deadline.
That was when- Treasury
Secretary Jacob Lew said the
government would reach the
current $16.7 trillion debt limit
and could no longer borrow to
meet its obligations.

Trial for Khmer Rouge party
leaders nears end in Cambodia

Civil lawyers call
for reparations for
those affected by the
brutal regime
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia
(AP) - Cambodia's trial of the
Khmer Rouge's two surviving
leaders began hearing clos-
ing statements Wednesday,
with pleas for belated justice
and reparations almost 40
years after the brutal regime
destroyed much of a generation
of Cambodian people.
Now ailing and elderly, Nuon
Chea, 87, the regime'schiefideol-
ogist, and Khieu Samphan, 82, its
head of state, are charged with
genocide and crimes against
humanity - including torture,
enslavement and murder - for
planning and implementing the
policies that left an estimated 1.7
million people dead.
Initial statements on Wednes-
day came from the lawyers of
"civil parties" participating in
the trial to represent the victims.
They called for collective repara-
tions in the form of commemora-
tive monuments, mental health
treatment for victims and col-
lections of documents related to
victims' suffering and to the trial.
Statements fromthe prosecu-
tion and defense are scheduled
through the end of October, and
a verdict is expected in the first
half of 2014.
Hundreds of victims who
lost their loved ones during
the regime's 1970s rule packed
the tribunal's courtroom and
crowded outside.
"I need to see justice," said
Prak Sri, 66, who traveled from

the southern province of Takeo.
"I want to see this court pun-
ish these Khmer Rouge leaders
because 11 of my relatives were
killed."
Death and disability have
robbed the tribunal of other
defendants. Khmer Rouge For-
eign Minister Ieng Sary died
in March, and his wife Ieng
Thirith, the regime's social
affairs minister, was declared
unfit for trial in September
2012 after being diagnosed with
dementia. The group's cop lead-
er, Pol Pot, died in 1998.
Just 20 minutes into Wednes-
day's hearing, Nuon Chea told
the court he felt ill.
"I feel dizzy. May I leave?"
the man known as Brother No.
2 told the court. He was escort-
ed out in a wheelchair, taken to
a holding cell to watch the pro-
ceedings via video link.
The Khmer Rouge, in power
from April 1975 until January
1979, emptied the country's cit-
ies, forcing Cambodians into
backbreaking work in rural col-
lectives and executing any it
suspected of dissent.
Torture and death by star-
vation, lack of medical care,
overwork and execution were
endemic under the Khmer Rouge.
Civil party lawyers recount-
ed testimony of mothers who
watched their babies die due to
lack of food and medicine and
families forcibly marched at
gunpoint across the countryside.
"Forced transfers involved
the complete emptying of towns
and cities," said civil party law-
yer Hong Kim Suon. "There was
usually no food, water, shelter or
medical care," he said.
"They were discarded,
dumped in the middle of

nowhere, left to their own
devices, eating leaves, roots,
watching their children die in
the cold, in the rain," said civil
party lawyer Elisabeth Simon-
neau Fort. "And they now
understood that they would be
exterminated, smashed, pul-
verized if they did not bend to
the (regime's) requirements."
"But still today there is akind
of inability to believe that this
happened, especially among
the victims, and the question
comes up again and again: How,
how did this happen?"
The civil party lawyers
expressed hope that the trial
would help victims find some
answers to the question of how
such horrors occurred.
"After more than 30yearstheir
right to justice and reparations
will be realized," said another
civil party lawyer, Pich Ang.
The tribunal, launched in
2006, so far has convicted only
one defendant, Khmer Rouge
prison director Kaing Guek
Eav, who was sentenced to life
imprisonment in 2011. Cambo-
dia has no death penalty. His
case was known as 001.
The current trial, Case 002,
against senior leaders of the
regime opened in November 2011
and has included 212 days of tes-
timony from 92 individuals.
To make a massive indict-
ment more manageable, the
court decided to split Case 002
into smaller "mini trials" that
would examine the evidence
in rough chronological order.
It was feared that the aging,
infirm defendants might not
survive long enough to complete
more comprehensive proceed-
ings, depriving victims of even a
modicum of justice.

Dozens of groups
renounce affiliation
with Syrian National
Coalition in Thrkey
BEIRUT (AP) - Several
dozen rebel groups in south-
ern Syria have broken with the
main political opposition group
in exile, a local commander
said in a video posted Wednes-
day, dealing a potential new
setback to Western efforts to
unify moderates battling Presi-
dent Bashar Assad's regime.
The Turkey-based Syrian
National Coalition, the political
arm of the Free Syrian Army
rebel group, has long struggled
to win respect and recognition
from the fighters. It is widely
seen as cut off from events on
the ground and ineffective in
funneling aid and weapons to
the rebels.
In the video, a rebel in mili-
tary fatigues read a statement
with about two dozen fighters
standing behind him, some hold-
ing a banner with FSA emblems.
FSA spokesman Louay Mik-
dad told The Associated Press
that the video is authentic and
identified the man speaking
as a captain in one of the rebel
groups, Anwar al-Sunna, which
posted the video.
The rebel in the video said
political opposition leaders
have failed to represent those
trying to bring down Assad.
. "We announce that we with-
draw our recognition from any
political group that claims to,
represents us, first among them
the Coalition and its leadership
which have relinquished the
principles of the homeland and
the revolution," he said.
He named 66 groups that he
said support his statement. The
man suggested rebel groups
would reorganize, saying that
"we are unifying the forces of
the revolution militarily and
politically," but did not explain
further.
It could not be confirmed
independently if all the groups
named in the video support
the statement. Noah Bonsey,
an expert on Syrian rebels at
the International Crisis Group
think tank, said one of the larger
groups named in the video did

not post the statement on its
Facebook page.
Nevertheless, Louay Mik-
dad, an FSA spokesman, said.
tle video should serve as a
wakeup call to the Coalition.
"We respect what they (the
rebels) are saying," he said. "We
think our brothers in the Coali-
tion ... should listen to the peo-
ple inside and they should open
a direct dialogue with them."
He said the FSA commander,
Gen. Salim Idris, would try to
speak to some of the groups
named in the video.
Coalition spokesman Khaled
Saleh did not immediately
respond to an emailed request
for comment.
Hundreds of groups of fight-
ers operate in Syria, often with
considerable local autonomy,
and shifting alliances are com-
mon in a chaotic battlefield.
Last month, nearly a dozen of
Syria's more powerful rebel
factions broke with the Coali-
tion and called for Islamic law
in the country, cementing the
rift between rival camps.
Rebel groups with a strong
Islamic orientation, from mod-
erates to hardliners, "appear
to be aligning themselves
politically, much more closely
than they have previously,"
said Charles Lister, an analyst
at -IHS Jane's Terrorism and
Insurgency Center.
The groups named Wednes-
day appear largely local and less
influential than those which
broke away from the Coalition
in September, Lister said.
Mikdad said they include
rebel groups from the south-
ern Daraa provinces and the
rural areas around the capital,
Damascus.
Southern Syria has been con-
sidered a stronghold of the mod-
erate opposition, while Islamic
extremists, including those
linked to al-Qaida, seem to be
spreading their influence in the
north and east.
The latest apparent setback
for the Coalition comes at a time
when it's tryingto decide wheth-
er to attend negotiations with the
regime on a political transition.
U.N. $ecretary-General Ban
Ki-moon said Wednesday that
the U.N., the U.S. and Russia are
"intensifying efforts" to start
such talks in Geneva in mid-
November.

(Over)protecfimg student privacy
Reasonable access to student data is beneficial to education research
n October 2, Michigan's state legislature introduced a bill that prohib-
its public schools and school districts from collecting certain personal
information about its students during homework, tests or other cur-
ricular assignments. Personal information, such as a student's socioeconomic
status or place of birth, as well as physiological information, such as biometrics
and facial-recognition markers, would be banned from collection. While the
intention behind this bill to bolster students' rights to privacy is laudable, the
outright ban of collecting potentially useful information is short-sighted and
does a disservice to the schools and students.

like, "It's a cold
one out there." In winter, they
crouch for hours on frozen lakes
with only a line through the ice
and their whole bodies, bundled in
down jackets except for their eyes,
steely with a fisherman's patience.
Of course, this all sounds like
a stereotype of what a man is sup-
posed to be. But this is how these
guys really act, and I think it's
because they know this strong-
silent-type persona is what our cul-
ture expects from them.
Feminists like myself often
lament the impossible demands
that society places on women. The
ominous "they" wants us to embody
perfection. "They" want us to navi-
gate the sinner-saint dichotomy
without so much as a whimper or a
lipstick smudge. We're supposed to
be' mothers and bimbos and virgins
and whores and wives. And yes,
these expectations are a big prob-
lem - they're reductive, dismissive
and the bane of feminine existence.
But I rarely hear my fellow femi-
nists talk about the ways in which
men also fall victim to societal pres-
sure, and how everyone can suffer
from the standards we set for them.
People have specific ideas about
what it means to be a man and,
unfortunately, a guy doesn't exem-
plify manliness simply by having a
penis. Instead, he must constantly
prove his masculinity and worth
as a man with prescribed behav-
iors - you know, doing dude stuff,
like hitting on chicks and strutting
around without a shirt on. Then, we
make all kinds of assumptions and
judgments about men based on how

they act.
We assume that dudes don't feel
deeplybecause theirbrains are busy
marinating in 30-racks of Busch
Light, football scores and whatev-
er their dicks want. We think that
men are incapable of communicat-
ing emotion and must use their fists
to settle arguments. We want every
man to emulate a sex idol - James
Dean at our house parties, the Rat
Pack at last call - and if they're not
suave and forward with women, we
call them pussies. We expect men to
calculate their every action, speak
eloquently if at all, puff up their
egos and have Teflon hearts. Basi-
cally, we expect guys to be stoic,
comfortable with violence and sex-
ually insatiable.
But by making these assump-
tions, we set a low standard for
male behav-
ior. We reduce
guys to aggres- W e a.
sive, unfeel-
ing caricatures perpett

These cartoon- w
ish projections inequ
then teach boys
that things like
tears and empa-
thy make men seem feminine,
which negates masculinity. Emo-
tion therefore becomes associated
with weakness and womanhood,
which demonizes the softest, most
human parts of a man, and leads to
a wider chasm between the genders
and encourages sexist behavior. For
example, a guy is much more likely
to put down women if he thinks
keeping them at a distance will
make him seem manlier in compar-
isgn. In short, we all help perpetu-
ate our own gender inequalities by
teaching boys and men that mas-
culinity is founded on withholding
their humanity.
However, I've loved men all of
my life, and the ones I've cared for
most have shown me their soft-
ness. My father's a big guy who will
"man up" to protect his family any
day, but he also sings love songs to
my mother and admits to weeping
every time he hears Joni Mitch-
ell's "For Free." At a time in middle

parties to make fun of my sparse
unibrow, boys were there to share
their earbuds on the bus as we
whipped past acres of farmland.
I've comforted two of my best male
friends, one under each of my arms,
as they cried through the end of
"50/50." The list goes on.
Essentially, I recognize men as
humans who are more than capable
of emotional complexity, and I love
it when dudes defy norms by flaunt-
ing their abilities to express them-
selves. I know that most men have it
in them to love and respect women,
and many do so regularly. In my
feminist circles I'm always defend-
ing guys when necessary, making
sure an individual isn't confused
with the entire patriarchy.

I need you to prove me right every

Falling victim to societal norms
isn't an excuse for truly bad behav-
ior, like violence or sexual aggres-
sion. The perpetuating stereotype
isn't all society's fault - many men
do play into it. But our culture also
needs to alter its definition of man-
hood. We need it to encompass the
characteristics we'd like to see in the
guys who hang out with our friends,
sisters and daughters. We need to
allow for features like gentleness
and respect and tears. By exiling
such human traits frommasculinity,
we all have a hand in molding many
men into the robots we resent. We
need men to feel safe enough to rise
above our expectations and show
their true, complex selves.

Bible. Satan himself. Antonin Scalia,
the man, believes in Beelzebub, the
character. Keep repeating this to
yourself as you go through this arti-
cle, otherwise you're liable to think
such a claim too dubious - the man
actually believes in the Devil.
In an in-depth interview with
Jennifer Senior of New York Mag-
azine, the justice went on record
to discuss many things, from his
staunch opposition to certain rights
for homosexuals to his favorite
television shows. Perhaps the most
surprising thing during the con-
versation was his genuinely stated
belief that the Devil of the Bible
is "a real person." Scalia cited his
Catholic faith as his reason for
believing, claiming that it was
what "every Catholic believes" and
is necessary "if you are faithful to
Catholic dogma."
When pressed for evidence of
the Devil's existence, Scalia admit-
ted that the Wicked One isn't mak-
ing pigs run off cliffs or possessing
people much these days (something
the Prince of Darkness was appar-
ently fond of during the time of the
Gospels) because He's gotten "wili-
er" over time. Scalia claims that the
Devil spends most of His time these
days convincing people He doesn't
exist (along with that god he sup-
posedly opposes), and that this is a
"more successful" strategy.
On Scalia's scoreboard it's Key-
ser Soze from the "The Usual Sus-
pects": 1, Regan MacNeil from the
"The Exorcist": 0.
Let's reflect for a moment on how

terrifying it is for the longest-serv-
ing justice currently on the Court to
take this absence of evidence as an
indication of a nefarious existence.
Far scarier than any demon is this
man with the Scales of Justice in
his hands feeling the weight of thin
air. The man actually believes in the
Devil.
Scalia then draws the conclusion
that this shift in diabolic strategy
from an active to a passive role is
"why there's not demonic posses-
sion all over the place." Nowhere
in the interview is there any hint
that Scalia has considered the null
hypothesis: there are no devils. No
angels have fallen from Heaven nor
serpents risen from Hell; people
have been people and the world
has been as it is far longer than
many traditional religious accounts
would insinuate. This, however, is
not how Justice Antonin Scalia sees
it all, a fact he has repeated time
again as he declares his Catholicism
the guiding philosophy behind the
justice he delivers.
This is the
same Catholi-
cism responsible As a chili
for witch hunts,
the Crusades the Del
and the Inquisi-
tion. This is the man,
philosophy of
a Church that only
believes the
introduction of
condoms in developing countries
is far worse than spread of HIV,
ordains that consenting adults
can only love each other in certain
ways, and has bred the one of larg-
est pedophilic scandals in human
existence. This philosophy convinc-
es grown men to believe in fairy-
tale monsters and excludes grown
women from its priestly class. It
should, therefore, come as no sur-
prise when Scalia was "offended"
by the interviewer's question, "Isn't
it terribly frightening to believe in
the Devil?" Given his philosophy,
it's the Devil who should be afraid.
As should we all.
That religious beliefs, ceremo-
nies and ideologies should have

no place in the governance of citi-
zens of this country is self-evident.
That a judge, let alone one of nine
responsible for shaping the rights
of hundreds of millions of people,
shouldn't accept conclusions with-
out evidence,isn't an unfair request,
indeed it is foundation upon which
all justice must be based. That this
conversation is even necessary
speaks to how far our civilization
still has before it.
To say that belief in devils and
demons, ghosts and spirits belong to
the childhood of our species is to be
too charitable with our condemna-
tion. We must and we should hold
such beliefs in contempt. No con-
temporary society benefits from its
populace's fear of its devils nor from
the charity of its gods. It's people
alone that determine what world we
have before us. It's a world that Scalia
would rather have perched over the
heat of Hell's fires than have homo-
sexual couples feel the warmth of
loving hands in emergency rooms.
The millions of people that believe
as he does stand

policy. The University said diver-
sity remains a priority despite
the state's ban on the race- and
gender-conscious admission pro-
cesses.
Ted Spencer, associate vice
provost and executive director of
undergraduate admissions, said
the admissions process analyses
how students will contribute to
and preserve the University com-
munity. The University takes a
"holistic approach" when con-
sidering applicants, taking into
account test scores, high-school
grade-point average, leadership
and application essays.
"We want to hear their voice,"
Spencer said. "We're looking for a
story, not a paper."
Over the past few years, Spen-
cer said each class has improved
from the last. He added that
although he says it at every fresh-
man convocation each year, this
year's class "is, once again, the
strongest class admitted to the
University of Michigan overall."
Spencer said the state's affir-
mative action ban put restrictions
on how admissions can ensure
they select a diverse class, but the
University has made efforts to
let students around the country
know that the school is open to
their applications.
"Racial and ethnic diversity is
very important to us," Spencer
said. "Due to the ban, we have
not been able to continue to grow,
r but we've been doing everything
we can across the country to say
that the University is identifying
students of all backgrounds and
doing the best we can to let them
know Michigan welcomes them

and can provide a good educa-
tion."
Spencer added that the Uni-
versity understands that a diverse
environment allows students to
learn better, as it reflects more of
a real-life situation.
LSA junior Sarah Ballew, co-
chair of the Native American
Student Association, said she
was unimpressed with the slight
increase in minority student
enrollment this year. Although
affirmative action is banned,
Ballew said the University should
reach out more to minority
groups, as Spencer says they try
to do.
"Coming to such a prominent
University, diversity is so impor-
tant because, you really need to,
have the perspectives of many
different people," Ballew said. "It
creates an enriched student life
curriculum, and what it really
boils down to is having represen-
tation and having minorities in
the academic setting helps learn-
ing."
As tuition rates increase each
year in part due to dwindling
state appropriation, the number
of non-resident students enrolled
has gone up as well.
Overall, the University hosts
21,947 in-state students, 15,704
out-of-state students and 6,059
international students, approxi-
mately 50 percent, 36 percent and
14 percent respectively.
For the 2012-2013 academic
year, there was a total of 43,426
students enrolled: 51 percent in-
state, 35 percent out-of-state and
14 percent international students.
This year, non-resident under-
classmen pay a total of $53,490
per semester at the University,
while lower division resident stu-
'dents pay $26,240 each semester.
While the University ensures full

need-based financial aid is met
for residents, University Provost
Martha Pollack said in March
that the University hopes to even-
tuallymeet full need-based finan-
cial aid for non-resident students
as well.
This aid will be supplemented
by a record amount of financial
aid from. the University, which
is dedicating $161.2 million for
undergraduate and graduate
need-based financial aid, and
increase of $16.4 million from last
year. The University's upcoming
capital campaign - set to launch
Nov. 8 - has a $1-billion goal for
student support to be raised over
the next few years.
As housing renovations con-
tinue with South Quad and, next
year, West Quad, University
Housing works closely with the
office of admissions to ensure
that each freshman has guaran-
teed housing.
University Housing spokes-
man Peter Logan said the hous-
ing renovations have challenged
University housing to get creative
with their layouts pending the
growing student body. To accom-
modate freshmen, the housing
staff bases the number of spaces
to make available for freshmen
off of projections made by the
Office of Admissions.
With renovations underway,
the housing staff has converted
former common study spaces into
bedrooms that can fit two to four
students and has made North-
wood III apartments a "first-year
living community" - meaning
a residence reserved solely for
freshman.
This year, 5,330 freshmen,
2,643 sophomores, 878 juniors,
466 seniors an4 1,270 graduate
students live in University hous-
ing.

gan Theater.
"The work that they're doing,
it's not what people traditionally
think of as art," Hamilton said.
"But at the same time, as artists,
one of their jobs is looking for-
ward."
Iaconesi and Persico cre-
ate projects that combine art,
technology and politics to
force people to consider how
their individuality and privacy
is impacted by the inherently
anonymous, intrusive nature of
technology.
"They're able to, through
their work, bring to society the
opportunity to have a dialogue
and see what the potentials are
for what's going on," Hamilton
said.
A way in which Iaconesi and
Persico create such dialogues
is by using unwitting people as
subjects for their art.
One project, titled "Incau-
tious Porn," is a mock form of
blackmail. Iaconesi and Persico

urges users to be cautious and
use common sense when making
purchases.
Newman cites his time at the
University as having influenced
the creation of LeftoverSwap.
"There was one class that
stood out for me in the Business
school," Newman said. "It taught
set up a fake company that takes
phone numbers left in comments
on porn websites, and generates
paintings out of them. Members
of the public are told that they
have to pay $10 to check if they
are in this company's database,
$50 to buy the painting with
their phone number and $1,000
to remove themselves from the
database.
The whole enterprise is a con-
trolled experiment - Iaconesi
and Persico don't actually keep
the phone numbers. If some-
one buys "their" painting, they
receive a painting with the origi-
nal comment, but with Iaconesi's
phone number, and the money
they paid goes toward research.
If someone sends in $1,000 to get
their information removed, they
receive a full refund and a how-
to guide for internet privacy.
The questions that Art is
Open Source raises are quite
prescient, and not just because
of the current media attention
on the NSA and government sur-
veillance. Two weeks ago, David
Segal of The New York Times
profiled the rise of websites
that post mugshots and demand
money in return for the mugshot
being taken down.

us to effect positive change in the
world, which is something that
really inspired me."
LeftoverSwap is currently
only available on Apple iOS
devices. Newman hopes to devel-
op an Android and web version
soon but does not have a launch
date.
"It's probably overdue to have
the dialogue that they're bring-
ing to the table," Hamilton said.
But Art is Open Source isn't
just limited to projects like this.
Iaconesi is a brain cancer sur-
vivor who, upon receiving his
diagnosis, posted his medical
records online for others to com-
ment on.
" 'Whenyou have somethingas
serious as cancer, your life disap-
pears and you are replaced by a
disease," Iaconesi said in a June
2013 TEDGlobal talk this year.
He eventually received over
500,000 responses from TED,
ranging from neuroscientists
recommending treatments to
someone sending him a sculp-
ture of his tumor.
Art is Open Source is about
this sort of dialogue, where peo-
ple come together and discuss
the pros and cons of what has
become a dominant part of their
daily lives.
"All of a sudden, you have to
start thinking about what the
effect of this (technology) is, and
what are the possible outcomes,
instead of blindly marching
forth," Hamilton said, "which
in society is what we've kind of
been doing so far."

that through Stamp Nation."
Stamp Nation meets every
Monday night in the CFC Lounge
in the Shapiro Undergraduate
Library. The group said they
would like to have concerts every
two weeks in the Diag but might
be looking for an indoor venue for
colder weather.
Business senior Josh Ross,
along with Sivakumar, helped
Hashwi put together the club
with the goal of helping bands
realize the resources available
on campus. Ross said the club is
looking to continue with Diag
performances as well as concerts
on a bigger level, possibly at Rack-
ham Auditorium, where students
could buy tickets ahead of time.
In addition to hosting perfor-
mances, such as a battle of the
bands,the club is also lookinginto
providing workshops to teach stu-
dents how to play instruments, as
there are no resources currently
on campus for non-music majors.
"(We would like to) partner

with other musicians. If they
want to throw a concert, we can,
help promote the show," Ross
said. "We want to do anything
where we can get musicians
together."
Business junior Brandon Can-
niff is a hip-hop songwriter and
performer who is hoping to tour
after earning his degree in music
business. He recently joined the
club and said it has been a great
place to meet other artists and
work together on performances.
"Eventually, we would want to
tune up with restaurants, bars,
etc. and find people who would
take our roster of musicians, who
we've tested, know that are good
and please the crowd, and really
do a show here," says Ross.
Though the concert did not
attract masses of students, many
students were aware of the per-
formance as they passed by.While
some only turned their heads and'
others took a quick video or pic-
ture, only a few paused to listen
for a couple of minutes.
LSA junior Danielle Strom was
listening to the concert while
waiting for a friend.
"I like that you can enjoy it if

you want, but you aren't forced
to," she said.
LSA freshman Megan Gizzi
wished she knew more about
when and where the performanc-
es were. ,
"I love listening to live music
but I had never heard of the club
until tonight," Gizzi said.
By the end of the night, what
was originally a quickly passing
audience had evolved into a small
group of students gathered in the
Diag, with some even clapping,
dancing and cheering on the per-
formers.
Ross said he feels passionately
about Stamp Nation creating the
right kind of environment for the
students.
"We want to be a place where
people can feel safe and chill (so)
that they can share their music
and share themselves. This is a
place where you can find people
like you, who share your passion
for music."

Crash was a result
of bad weather,
government said
BANGKOK (AP) - A plane
from Laos' state-run airline
crashed in bad weather in the
Southeast Asian nation, appar-
ently killing 49 people from 11
countries, the government said.
The Lao government said it
was dispatching rescuers to the
scene of Wednesday's crash,
but the Australian government
said it was told no survivors
were expected.
The Ministry of Public
Works and Transport, which
operates Lao Airlines, said 44
passengers and five crew mem-
bers were on Flight QV301 from
the capital, Vientiane, to Pakse
in the country's south. Earlier
reports had 39 passengers.
"Upon preparing to land
at Pakse Airport the aircraft
ran into extreme bad weather
conditions and was report-
edly crashed into the Mekong
River," the ministry said in a
statement.
The airline flies an ATR
72-600 twin-engine turboprop
plane on the 467-kilometer
(290-mile) route. French maker
ATR said the plane that crashed
had been delivered in March.
The aircraft is configured with

68-74 seats, it said.
Thai Foreign Ministry
spokesman Sek Wannamethee
said his country's embassy in
Vientiane was informed that
the plane crashed 7-8 kilome-
ters (4-5 miles) from the airport
at Pakse.
A passenger manifest faxed
by the airline listed 44 peo-
ple: 17 Lao, seven French, five
Australians, five Thais, three
Koreans, two Vietnamese and
one person each from Cana-
da, China, Malaysia, Taiwan
and the United States. Kore-
an, French and Thai officials
confirmed the totals for their
nationalities.
Australia's Department of
Foreign Affairs and Trade said
six Australians were on board,
a discrepancy that couldn't
immediately be reconciled. Rel-
atives released a photo of Gavin
and Phoumalaysy Rhodes and
their two young children. The
government said the other two
Australians were an aid worker
based in Laos and his father.
The Lao government said
the airline "is taking all neces-
sary steps to coordinate and
dispatch all rescue units to the
accident site in the hope of find-
ing survivors."
However, the Australian
foreign affairs statement said,
"Lao authorities have told our
embassy in Vientiane they do

not expect any survivors."
The Lao transport minis-
try statement said the crash
is being investigated and the
airline hoped to announce its
findings on Thursday. A Vao
Airlines employee contacted
by phone at Vientiane's Wattay
airport said a news conference
would be held Thursday.
ATR issued a statement from
its headquarters in Toulouse,
,France, declaring that it will
fully assist the investigation. It
said the Lao Airlines plane had
been delivered from the pro-
duction line in March this year.

STEM
From Page 1A
petitive grant program available
to organizations that provide
classroom or extracurricular
STEM programs for students,
from pre-kindergarten to the
college level across the state.
Though criteria for these
competitive grants have not
yet been determined, Barbara
Bolin, executive director of
STEM Partnership, said the
grants will be awarded to pro-
grams that create project-based
learning activities that involve
the students in applying class-
room knowledge.
STEM proponents say they
are placing a heavy emphasis on
project-based learning because
students tend to learn best when
they apply their knowledge in
real-world contexts.
Zemke said he believes the
hands-on, project-based learn-
ing inherent in STEM education
will make students more enthu-
siastic about school.

"Kids get really excited about
technical stuff when they actu-
ally get to put their hands on it
and can connect the dots with
an instructor," he said.
Bolin sees STEM's active
approach to learning as a better
alternative to traditional meth-
ods.
"Sitting (students) in class-
rooms and lecturing to them
and working exercise after exer-
cise from a textbook have not
been very effective, and conse-
quently students become disen-
gaged - they don't see the point
of what they're being asked to
learn," she said.
Bolin and Zemke said grant
money could be awarded to
iniaitives like the High School
Enterprise Program, in which
a team of students operate as
and deal with practical matters
of a company; the A World In
Motion program, which incor-
porates the laws of physics,
motion, flight and electronics
into hands-on activities; as well
as technical competition teams,
such as the University's Solar
Car team.

Zemke said he's concerned
with the state's significant
shortage of engineers. In addi-
tion to improving engagement
with young students, STEM
education is essential to the
health of Michigan's manufac-
turing-driven economy, he said.
While explicit budgetary
commitments to STEM educa-
tion are more recent, Michigan
has long placed an emphasis on
math and science as it estab-
lished the Mathematics and Sci-
ence Centers Program in 1988.
According to its website, it has
since grown to a network of 33
regional centers that "provide
leadership, curriculum support,
professional -evelopment, and
student services to educators."
The $375,000 grant to the
STEM Partnership comes as
part of a $500,000 budget
increase to the science and math
center budget for fiscal year
2014, and a 3-percent increase
to the overall education budget.
Zemke said, "If we want suc-
cessful students to come out of
our public education system, we
need to help all levels."

Thompson-Shaw
ignites off the bench

By BRAD WHIPPLE
Daily Sports Writer
This late in the women's soc-
cer season, it's harder to substi-
tute bench players into games
since the stakes are too high in a
BigTengame to experimentwith
unproven players. Against No. 17
Penn State on Sunday, Michigan
coach Greg Ryan started junior
defender Keyana Thompson-
Shaw anyway. She had only
played one game this season, but
the experiment paid off.
"I would say she performed
at 100 percent (against Penn
State)," Ryan said. "I didn't think
she could last 90 minutes, and I
said, 'If you get tired, just let me
know and we'll get a sub in for
you.' That hand never went up."
Sunday, the matchup between
the 12th-ranked Wolverines and
the Nittany Lions ended in a
1-0 shutout for Michigan with a
goal from senior midfielder Tori
McCombs. The win by the Wol-
verines (4-1-1 Big Ten, 10-2-1
overall) put them in second place
in the Big Ten standings and
quenched their thirst for revenge
by defeating the team that oust-
ed them in the third round of last
year's NCAA Tournament.
Ryan said the contest was one
of the most defensively challeng-
ing games Michigan has played
this season as it held the top
scoring offense in the conference
without a goal. Penn State (4-2,
10-3-1) outshot the Wolverines
21-7, but Thompson-Shaw's per-
formance on defense was critical
to the team's success.
"It just shows how hard she's
been working every practice all
year," said senior defender She-
lina Zadorsky. "To be able to step
into arguably one of our hardest
games and perform like that on
the spot is what we needed from
her, and she was able to deliver."
Despite only playing one
game this season prior to Sun-
day, Thompson-Shaw is familiar
with the Nittany Lions' style. She
has had five career starts, three
of which were in Happy Valley,
including last year's loss i1 the
NCAA Tournament.

"I think once you go for a pro-
longed period of time without
playing you do have to person-
ally keep your positivity up,"
Thompson-Shaw said. "I was a
little nervous going in, but I did
play last year and I had the sup-
port of my team around me to
pick me up."
When Thompson-Shaw took
the field, her focus was to cover
senior forward Maya Hayes, the
Nittany Lions' leading scorer
with 13 goals. Hayes's speed has
been a huge challenge for her
opponents' defense and allowed
her to easily get behind teams'
back lines and create scoring
opportunities.
Thompson-Shaw shut down
Hayes by holding her to only one
shot on goal. With Shaw putting
pressure on Hayes in the 18-yard
box, Zadorsky and fellow seniors
Christina Murillo and Holly
Hein had an easier time protect-
ing the back line. Ryan said that
Thompson-Shaw's performance
took the defense to another level.
As the Wolverines closed the
passing lanes and put pressure
on Penn State's attack, the Nit-
tany Lions were limited to seven
shots on goal that were all saved
by freshman goalkeeper Taylor
Bucklin, who was named Big Ten
Defensive Player of the Week on
Monday.
But it was Thompson-Shaw
who endured 90 minutes of non-
stop defense against one of the
conference's most unstoppable
forwards. Thompson-Shaw's
performance put Michi-
gan's defense in sync, making
McCombs's goal all that was
needed to earn the first shutout
since Sept.27.
Though he rarely throws her
in the lineup, Ryan said Thomp-
son-Shaw is the best individual
defender on the team at stopping
strong forwards and will be used
for certain matchups. With her
senior year looming around the
corner, Thompson-Shaw might
find herself starting more often.
"Maybe I need to give that kid
some more time," Ryan said. "We
wouldn't have won that game
without Keyana."

Last year was former Michi-

last shot at the Big Ten title she
came to Michigan to win. Late
in the season, she went into
State College needing a victory.

It was the 86th minute. Former

straight Big Ten title with a tie,
the Nittany Lions earn home-
field advantage through the
third round of the NCAA Tour-
nament, then beat Michigan ina
penalty-kick shootout.
Just outside Seattle this sum-
mer, Kopmeyer and Nairn, the
two Big Ten rivals, set aside
their collegiate roots.
They played four years each
at Michigan and Penn State,
compiling two of the most illus-
trious careers in the history of
their schools. They moved 2,000
miles west. And then they lived
together for six months.
Teammates on the Seattle
Reign FC of the National Wom-
en's Soccer League, Kopmeyer
and Nairn, both 2012 graduates,
shared an apartment this sum-
mer.
"We talked about it a lot,"
Kopmeyer said. "This was our
common bond to begin with.
It was definitely a topic, whose
school is better, a little bit of
smack talk here and there, but
nothing too mean."
When they were drafted in
January, they didn't know much
about each other, even after
playing against one another for
four years. They had gone to a
camp together before college.
Then, Kopmeyer sent a Face-
book message to Nairn asking if
she wanted to live with her..
They found an apartment 10
minutes from the training facil-
ity. But the situation didn't come
without its occasional Michi-
gan-Penn State debates.
"We're both the type of peo-
ple where we know we can joke
with each other," Nairn said.
"When we dish it out, we can
take it. It's all in good fun."
The two have moved out
since the end of the season last
August. Kopmeyer now lives
in San Diego and trains with a
goalkeeping coach in prepara-
tion for next season in April. She
was waived last year because
she backed up Hope Solo, who
happens to be the starter for the
U.S. Women's National Team.
Nairn lives and trains in State
College and called the women's
soccer game between Michigan
and Penn State for Big Ten Net-
work on Sunday.
Though now living 3,000
miles apart, the two anticipated
the rivalry game when their for-
mer teams played Sunday.
"We joked about it a lot, the
Penn State-Michigan thing and

always playing against each
other," Kopmeyer said. "There
were times when even in prac-
tice, our coaches could see it....
They thought it was funny, and
they could tell that there was
definitely a rivalry there."
The stakes were high as
always this year, with Michigan
needing a win to stay in the Big
Ten race and Penn State needing
a win to stay in contention for its
16th straight conference cham-
pionship.
In the end, the Wolverines
came out with the narrow victo-
ry, something they hadn't done
against Penn State since 2002.
"Going down in penalty kicks,
especially the way it happened
when we were up, that was
hard," Kopmeyer said. "I was
cheering (Sunday) like I was on
the sidelines.
It's so fun to see how far this
team has come. I'm so proud and
happy to have been a part of it.
I realize that a lot of my time
there was spent growing as a
team and rebuilding and putting
together (Michigan coach Greg
Ryan's) vision, and it's really
here now. I couldn't be happier
for those girls."
Kopmeyer said she and Nairn
talked back and forth on social
media about the game. She
posted a picture last Wednesday
of Nairn holding Kopmeyer's
dog in a Michigan collar. Nairn
replied with a picture of her four
Big Ten championship rings.
"I know the Michigan girls
all knew about it, and they were
like, 'Don't worry, girl, we got
your back,"' Kopmeyer said.
They likely won't room
together again nextyear because
Kopmeyer may be playing for a
new team. Still, both enjoyed
living together this summer.
"Haley's hilarious," Nairn
said. "She's so smart. Sometimes
she's making fun of me, and I
have no idea that she is."
Michigan and Penn State
will continue to wrestle with
the conference lead along with
Nebraska.
The Wolverines are two
points back in the standings,
while the Nittany Lions are
three. They could meet again in
the Big Ten or NCAA Tourna-
ments.
other than that, the rivalry
will be put to bed until next
year, when Kopmeyer, Nairn
and their schools will start it up
all over again.

TERRA MOLENGRAFF/Daily
Redshirt junior quarterback Devin Gardner said, "It's all about what happens in Schembechler Hall and what happens in this building"
For first time in oke 's
tenure, wee under seige

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily SportsEditor
He had been as patient as he
could all week, but by Wednes-
day night, Michigan coach Brady
Hoke was tired of answering
questions about his team's loss to
Penn State.
"Why are we talking about
it?" he asked Jim Brandstatter on
Hoke's weekly radio show on the
Michigan IMG Sports Network.
After the show, Hoke was done
with regularly scheduled media
sessions for the week. That's like-
ly fine with him.
For the first time in his tenure,
Hoke has found himself in the
middle of a miniature tempest
this week as his team prepares
for Indiana on Saturday. It had
been quietly brewing for weeks
now: first the near-upset against
Akron, then the close win over
Connecticut. But it was the come-
from-ahead, quadruple-overtime
loss to Penn State that - fairly or
not - set off a wave of criticism
from around Ann Arbor and in
the blogosphere.
In his press conferences on
Monday and Wednesday, Hoke
faced the most pointed questions
he has seen in his time here:
Was he concerned about the
offensive line coaching, he was
asked Monday?
"No, not at all," Hoke said

Was the play calling too con-
servative?
"No."
He was asked if he'd keep the
I-formation (he would) and the
unbalanced formation (that too).
Does the team understand what
kind of team it wants to be?
Hoke just chuckled.
This happens to all college
football coaches. All teams lose
at times. Even Bo Schembechler's
1984 team went 6-6. And most
college fan bases are not shining
examples of emotional stability,
and Michigan, even at 5-1, is no
exception.
But as the Wolverines try to
solve deep, lingering issues with
the offensive line, pass rush and
turnovers, they now must con-
tend with the distractions that
come with an ornery fan base.
In Hoke's first press conference
as the Michigan coach on Jan. 12,
2011, he became emotional when
speaking about Michigan's tradi-
tion. He said he would've walked
to Ann Arbor to become its coach.
The press conference was raw
and endearing, and he would later
enjoy a lengthy period of stability
and support.
In this climate, Schembechler
Hall again became known as
"Fort Schembechler" - nothing
in, and nothing out. That's been
an emphasis this week.
"We talk about the important

things that are said are what's in
this room," Hoke said. "No one
else really matters besides the
guys in the room."
Michigan also brought in moti-
vational speaker Eric Thomas,
whose message was "kill the
noise," according to redshirt
junior quarterback Devin Gard-
ner.
"Which is what our coaches
have been preaching to us for-
ever," Gardner said. "It has noth-
ing to do with the outside world,
what everybody else thinks. It's
all about what happens in Schem-
bechler Hall and what happens in
this building."
Outside, the siege continued all
week. After Hoke's media session
on Monday, it was offensive coor-
dinator Al Borges's turn on Tues-
day. He, too, encountered some of
the sharpest questions he's faced
during his tenure in Ann Arbor.
Why the delay of game pen-
alties, one reporter asked? (An
aberration, he said, not a recur-
ring problem.) Has he lost con-
fidence in the inside running
game?
"No, no. We haven't lost confi-
dence in anything," Borges said.
What was his philosophy at the
end of the game?
"Well, we have the best kicker
in the league," he said. "At least,
we think."
Did he change his offensive

approach during the game?
"Because the bowergamewasn't
as good, you can't just say, 'We're
not goingto do it anymore,' "Borges
said. "You still have to sprinkle it
in."
During the week, players were
quick to defend Borges. Senior
wide receiver Drew Dileo point-
ed out how smart Borges is, how
much experience he has.
Hoke said he doesn't need to
spend extra time with the offen-
sive line because, "I've got a great
offensive line coach. I've got a
great coordinator. I'm with them
enough because we go so much
against each other. I don't need to
do that. That's some coach trying
to think he's a hero. That's not me.
I'm not a hero."
Still, Hoke and Gardner both
allowed that it's impossible to
tell how each individual player
will react to criticism of the team,
younger players especially. The
responsibility is on the older play-
ers, Gardner said, to deflect the
noise.
"I mean, everybody's gonna
have their opinion whether you
win or lose," Gardner said. "So I
mean, we lost one game but that
doesn't determine how our sea-
son's gonna end and how we're
gonna finish. That's up to us.
Whether we finish strong or let
this loss be a cloud over your
head."

Core of seniors

By DAVID GRANADIER
For theDaily
Last year's Michigan volley-
ball team made it to the NCAA
Tournament semifinals with
one senior on the squad. This
season, five seniors are looking
to lead the team even further.
Outside hitters Molly Toon

Jennifer Cross and defensive

The teams who compete in
college football's new play-
off system will be chosen by a
Rhodes Scholar, a former U.S.
Secretary of State and a former
congressperson, among others.
Beginning in the 2014 sea-
son, the group will look at win-
loss record, schedule strength,
head-to-head results and con-
ference titles to determine
which four teams will compete
for the national championship.
A committee comprising
the conference commissioners
tasked with overseeing the new
system selected the 13-person
selection committee.
Bill Hancock, executive
director of the College Football
Playoff, announced the names
Wednesday. Combined, the
committee has about 230 years
of experience in college foot-
ball.
"We wanted people of the
highest integrity for this com-
mittee, and we got them," Han-
cock said ina statement. "Every
one of them has vast football
knowledge, excellent judgment,
dedication and love for this
game."

Term lengths will "gener-
ally" be three years, according
to the press release. The com-
mittee will meet several times
during the season, and then
again on selection weekend to
determine the participants of
the two semifinal games.
Five members of the commit-
tee currently serve as Directors
of Athletics at their respective
schools: Jeff Long at Univer-
sity of Arkansas-Fayetteville,
BarryAlvarez at Wisconsin, Pat
Haden at Southern California,
Oliver Luck at West Virginia
and Dan Radakovich at Clem-
son.
Condoleezza Rice, currently
a professor at Stanford after her
time as U.S. Secretary of State,
is also on the committee, as is a
former U.S. Air Force Academy
Superintendent, Lieutenant
General Mike Gould.
Former NCAA Executive

back Archie Manning, former

the drill will translate to the
team's forecheck, which is impor-

opportunities, the lack of which
also concerns Berenson.
"I want them to be hard on the

Still no answers at left guard,
where 5 players fight for spot

By MATT SLOVIN
ManagingEditor
The leftcguard position for the
Michigan football team might
as well be a revolving door.
That's because, instead of clar-
ity coming to NOTEBOOK
the offensive
line picture
at the season's midway point,
things are becoming increas-
ingly jumbled.
Redshirt freshman Erik
Magnuson, listed on the depth
chart as a backup tackle, is the
latest player to take reps at left
guard. He spent much of Satur-
day's loss at Penn State filling
in for injured fifth-year senior
left tackle Taylor Lewan. Mag-
nuson's versatility makes him
an ideal candidate to rotate
between the line positions.
"He hasn't done that a lot, but
he's a really athletic guy," said
Michigan coach Brady Hoke at
his Wednesday press confer-
ence. "He did some good things
the other night that warrant
trying to get the best five on the
field."
According to Hoke, no deci-
sion has been made as to who
will emerge from the logjam

at the position to start against
Indiana this week. He said five
different players have been
rotating at left guard in practice
- Magnuson, freshman Kyle
Bosch, redshirt freshman Kyle
Kalis, redshirt sophomore Chris
Bryant, who started against
the Nittany Lions, and redshirt
junior Joey Burzynski.
Hoke noted that Magnuson,
who is 6-foot-6 and 285 pounds,
had to get stronger to catch up
with his classmates. His high-
school career as a lacrosse play-
er meant he missed out on time
in the weight room.
"He's got a quickness to him,"
Hoke said. "He's got good feet.
That's why we recruited him at
left tackle - because of his ath-
leticisih."
SCHEDULES LEAKED: A few
hours before Michigan's 2018
and 2019 conference schedules
were slated to be released by the
Big Ten on Wednesday morning,
they appeared on mgoblue.com.
In both of those seasons,
the Wolverines will be tested
right off the bat in the Big Ten
against traditional powers. A
home game against Nebraska
will open the 2018 conference
schedule, while Michigan will

play at Wisconsin in its first Big
Ten game of 2019.
Starting next season, the
Wolverines will play against
their top two rivals, Michigan
State and Ohio State, at home
in the same seasons and on the
road in the same seasons. That
trend will continue, with both
of those games being played on
the road in 2018 and at the Big
House in 2019.
Michigan will play each team
in the newly formed East Divi-
sion, as well as three crossover
match-ups. In 2018, the cross-
overs are Nebraska, Northwest-
ern and Wisconsin. In 2019, they
will be against Wisconsin, Iowa
and Illinois.
The complete 2018 and 2019
Big Ten schedules can be found
here.
INJURY UPDATE: Lewan suf-
fered a couple different "boo
boos," as Hoke said, against
Penn State, causing him to miss
the second half.
According to Hoke, the ail-
ments won't keep him out of the
game against the Hoosiers.
Lewan appeared woozy as he
stumbled to the sidelines after
walking most of the way off the
field on his own accord.
When asked if Lewan under-
went tests for a concussion,
Hoke said that the tackle saw
the team's doctors but wouldn't
explicitly say what the injury
was.
A few plays after Lewan was
injured, he sprinted back onto
the field, much to Hoke's sur-
prise.
The coaching staff needed to
physically separate Lewan from
his helmet in order to prevent
him from trying to re-enter the
game in the second half.
"I didn't see it," Hoke said of
Lewan's sneaky return. "But he
didn't play after chat, did he?"
NOTES: Motivational speaker
Eric Thomas, a former Michi-
gan State consultant, addressed
the team Wednesday. Redshirt
junior quarterback Devin Gard-
ner said it helped the team to
"kill the noise" coming from
public criticism of the team fol-
lowing its first defeat. ... Hoke
said placing additional focus on
an increased offensive tempo to
simulate Indiana is unnecessary
because the team typically prac-
tices that way regardless.

After all the initial outrage
over the new Michigan football
student seating policy - followed
by full crowds, followed by grum-
bling about wait times, followedby
empty seats - a new survey shows
the general opinion about the seat-
ing policy has changed very little.
Initially, a large majority of stu-
dents opposed the policy. Midway
through the season, a large major-
ity of students still oppose the
policy.
In a survey conducted by the
Central Student Government
released Wednesday, 76 percent
of respondents indicated that they
opposed the policy, compared to
17 percent who said they were
supportive. Prior to the season, 73
percent opposed the policy, with
14 percent in support.
The number of responses
points to the high level of student
engagement with the issue. In
slightly more than 24 hours, 5,892
students responded. The survey
was sent in an email from CSG
President Michael Proppe on Oct.
8.
Overall, 77 percent of respon-
dents said the 2012 season was a
more enjoyable experience. Just
eight percent said 2013 was more
enjoyable.
CSG presented the findings
to the SACUA Student Relations
Advisory Committee meeting on
Oct. 11. On Oct. 15, Proppe pre-
sented analysis of the results to
the Athletic Department. Accord-
ing to a CSG press release, the Ath-
letic Department has expressed a
willingness to consult with stu-
dents and faculty before deter-
miningthe 2014 ticketpolicy.
"Though there wasn't much
student input leading up to the
switch to general admission, the
Athletic Department has been
very responsive to student con-
cerns since then," Proppe said in
the release. "This meeting was
another huge step forward."
Proppe added that "next year's
process will be an improvement
over this year's."
The survey also provided a
glimpse at why students support-
ed or opposed the policy. Inter-
estingly, both groups listed the
same reasons. For those who sup-

ported the policy, 81 percent said
they liked the flexibility to choose
with whom they sit. That was the
most popular reason for support-
ing the policy. Among those who
opposed the policy, 85 percent
said they couldn't sit with friends
who didn't arrive atthe same time.
That was also the most popular
reason for opposingthe policy.
Forty-two percent of support-
ers said the policy creates a better
atmosphere in the student section.
Seventy-five percent of those who,
opposed said it hasn't improved
the environment. And then there
were the six percent of those who
support the policy - about 60
respondents - who said they were
in favor of the plan because they
enjoy standing in line.
"We reviewed the Central Stu-
dent Government's survey results,
and while some results were not
surprising based on our own
shared observations, there was
some feedback that will be very
helpful in making improvements
going forward," said Michigan
Athletics Chief Marketing Offi-
cer Hunter Lochmann in the CSG
press release. "We look forward to
working with the CSG to review
our ticketing policies in general as
we make decisions for future sea-
sons."
The Athletic Department has

declined the Daily's requests for
comment on the student ticket
policy.
The department announced the
policy change in an email on April
23. Students immediately resist-
ed the change, and within three
hours, a Facebook group opposing
the change garnered more than
1,500 'likes.' Within 24 hours, a
formal online petition through
CSG requesting a shift back to the
old procedure of assigned seats
had more than 2,600 signatures.
The policy announcement also 2
came with a price hike, to $295
for seven games in 2013, includ-
ing service fees, from $205 for six
games in 2012. That makes Michi-
gan the second-most expensive
student ticket out of the 129 FBS
or soon-to-be FBS schools in 2013.
The Daily conducted a Face- '
book poll on April 24, in which
77.2 percent of the 643 voters indi-
cated they hated the policy, but
the CSG survey was the first for- E
mal poll conducted of the student
population.
When the season began, the
student section was full for the
opener against Central Michigan
and the night game the following
week against Notre Dame. But by
the next two home games - Akron
and Minnesota - large swaths of
the student section were empty.

Tatch out, Five Guys
there's a new ham-
burger in town. If
you ask me, it's about time.
. Ann Arbor, surprisingly,
has never
really offered
much when
it comes
to burger
joints. Of
course you
can order
a burger at NATE
nearly every WOOD
bar in town,
but as far
as restaurants that special-
ize in the American classic,
there are few: Red Robin (way
down State Street), Quickie
Burger (terrible food) and most
recently Five Guys (not a bad
choice). My bet is that Blimpy
Burger - may she rest in peace
- long dominated the campus
market for hamburgers with
its cult following, effectively,
staving off competition for
decades. Now that Blimpy's
gone, though (at least for now),
I wouldn't be surprised if we
see a rapid influx of new burger
joints in the near future.
BurgerFi, Ann Arbor's new-
est place to grab a patty and
fries, would have us call this
the "Burgerfication" of Ann
Arbor. The new fast-casual
restaurant opened its doors
on South University just over
two weeks ago. I was excited
enough at the prospect of fill-
ing the burger-less void in my
heart - and stomach - that
Blimpy left with its closing. But
when I heard that BurgerFi was
billing itself as "The Burger
Joint for Foodies," I knew it
would be love at first bite.
The restaurant's interior is
industrial-modern. The stools
and chairs are made from recy-
cled Coke bottles and the tables
from milk cartons. Sheets of.
hard stone cover the floor, giv-
ing way to walls of unstained
2x4 planks of light wood. The
ceiling is a patchwork of metal

"Lightning Bolt" "Shake"

Let's just face it: The Pearl Jam ofbygone years
has disappeared, replaced with the new version
where Eddie Vedder reads soldiers' obituaries
in the morning paper. Just so, "Lightning Bolt"
bears a lot more resemblance to "World Wide
Suicide" than anything from Ten - but hey, out
with the old, in with the new. "Lightning Bolt"
definitely has its moments, at least - it's upbeat
and fun, and you're more likely than not to catch
yourself humming along before the song ends.
Just don't expect some classic grunge magnum
opus. Pearl Jam keeps on keeping on, but those
face-melting days might be over.

What's that you're hearing? Could it - could I
it be? An electric guitar? In a The Head and
the Heart song? In the words of the insmortal
Kenan Thompson: What up with that? All in
all though, don't let the soft touch of technol-
ogy fool you - this is the classic folksiness you
came for in the new HatH album. So what if
there's a touch of raw amp? In an album called
Let's Be Still, maybe you should be grateful that

Johnson croons, "You won't forget the man
who's making you shake." Don't be afraid of a

MICH IGAN DAILY

Under the stage name, Tycho, producer and
visual artist Scott Hansen makes calming,
ambient techno that's perfect for taking the
edge off of procrastinated homework. "Awake,"
Tycho's latest single, furthers the hypnotic
tone of Hansen's 2011 album, Dive, and places
his always ambling guitars higher in the mix.
Stuck on writing the thesis for an essay that's
due in a few hours? Let "Awake" be the calming
drug you wish you had a prescription for, and
then once it's effects have subsided, make sure
to go to the Spotify page for Dive and then start

"What You Want" are typical tracklist fodder,
crawling through over four minutes of open
mic-like croons, Birdy banks on "Skinny Love'
- and not only because it's a cover of Grammy-
winning Bon Iver's delicate hit. As fragilely
angelic as 17-year-old Birdy herself, "Skinny
Love" is a piano-laced plea for mercy, just beg-7

CURTAIN
From Page 1B
This sort of cohesion ofthe crew
could only come from practic-
ing the entrances and exits. After
moving into the Lydia Mendels-
sohn Theatrethe week before, tech
week officially began.
"We moved into the theater
on Wednesday, October 2nd, and
we had two spacing rehearsals,"
Cohen said, rehashing the busy
week. "We did Act 1 on Wednes-
day and Act 2 on Thursday, which
was for figuring out how to work
on stage, and then we begin tech,
which is slowly going through the
show and figuring out the lights
and the sequencing of stuff."
Before the show began, Cohen
and Director Mark Madama went
through notes he had for her, ask-
ingabout lighting, scene entrances
and timing.
"Everything that happens,
we're doing this all through the
rehearsal process, but this devel-
ops over the course of the show.
We make mistakes," DeLaduran-
taye said. "This isthe final version,
so by nowthere are pretty much no
mistakes. It's our job to help every-
thing happen. It's like people-
organizing."
Cohen called the final min-
utes before lights on and a rush of
bodies filled the backstage. The
opening scene, consisting of five
"Liebeslieder Singers," or Sond-
heim's chorus, instantly allowed
the show to reflect the dedication
and hard work of the weeks of
rehearsal. Each actor went onstage
in character and after exiting,
stayed in character until they were
safely in the green room.
The crew mouthed the words
to each song and scene, having
memorized the performance. The
sets changed without a hitch, each
crew member working seamlessly
t|gether, knowing exactly where
fo stand so that the rolling set piec-
es wouldn't move under an actor's
weight.

damage was quickly controlled -
few realized what had happened

est of hiccups were discussed.

crew members, the dedication and

planning that goes into a show
such as this reflects the passion
and love for theater: the desire to
be a part of an industry focused on
creating flawless performances.
"Ten minutes to the top of Act
2; this is 10 minutes to the top of
Act 2," Cohen reminds everyone to
take their places before the second
act can begin.
Everyone goes to their spot,
chatting excitedly and quietly with
their friends and co-performers.
Crew members whisper into their
headsets, making last-minute
adjustments. Two actorshug, obvi-
ously the best bro-friends. Every-
one waits for Cohen's cue.

"The show is supposed to be
quite good!" the usher told me
excitedly as she led me to my seat
in the sixth row. Ever the great
conversationalist, I replied dryly,
"Yeah, I hope so." She raised her
eyebrows and hurried away. In ret-
rospect, I could hardly blame her,
but in my defense, my sentiments
at the time could not have been
more honest. The night was a night
of many firsts: the first time I'd
taken advantage of an opportunity
to witness a theatrical production
and the first time I'd walked into
the Mendelssohn Theatre.

It was the first time I realized
what it means to stick out like
a sore thumb. Dressed in jeans,
slippers and an over-worn jacket
thrown over a T-shirt, I looked
every bit a college kid in a crowd of
(very) well-dressed, and probably
rich, old people. As I took my seat, I
was thankful for the cold, crisp fall
air thatprevented me from coming
along in shorts, as was my initial
intention.
With so many firsts comes the
inescapable feeling of hope, which
explains say rather succinct reply
to the excited usher. I hoped that
the University's production of "A
Little Night Music" would be con-
sistent with tonight's prevalent
theme and provide me with my
first enjoyable theatrical experi-
ence.
However, I couldn't help but be
offset by the interiors of the Men-
delssohn. Obviously I'm no expert
in the intricacies of theater decor,
but in my mind's eye, I had pic-
tured something more lively than
the current setting. I wasn't there
to appreciate the surroundings,
but how can one not notice the
dim lighting and bland interior?
The initially overwhelming sense
of hope that came hand-in-hand
with my first experience in front
of the stage had been canceled out
by the underwhelming aura of the
theater, and I sat in my seat - an
adequately whelmed scruffy col-
lege kid.
Soon, the curtains rose, piano
chords sounded, performers ...
began performing. Needless to say,
the sound of music and the accom-
panying voices injected new life
into the place, but it was hard for
me to understand any of the words
so melodiously belted out. As I
acclimated to the singing, I finally
began to realize there are two-
and-a-half more hours of "A Little
Night Music" left.
The play is about the complica-
tions of love and lust, told through
the story of an ensemble of curi-
ous characters. Fredrik Egerman
is a lawyer, who is married to an
18-year-old girl, Anne Egerman.
However, Anne is the subject of
Henrik Egerman's affections, the
lawyer's son. Fredrik desires the
famous actress Desiree Armfledt,
with whom he has a romantic his-
tory. Desiree is a flirtatiouswoman
seemingly adept at juggling the
romantic attentions of the lawyer
and a Count Carl-Magnus, who is
married to Countess Malcolm.
It's easy to see how such a
setup can make for an entertain-
ing comedy of errors filled with
interesting developments that are
bound to keep audiences attentive

throughout. I did a bit of reading
before attending the production
and found out that this show was
Broadway's first play centered on
adult humor. The idea was intrigu-
ing, and I was eager to see how it
would play out on stage. Suffice
it to say, I wasn't disappointed.
The brand of humor prevalent
throughout the show was won-
derfully subtle and low-key, never
once indulging and falling into the
dangerous realms of crass comedy.
The performers did justice to the
wonderfully written script, excel-
lently delivering the many puns
and punch lines, making the play
very enjoyable. Though the show
had its fair share of musical num-
bers, they didn't offset the pacing
and effortlessly merged with the
narrative. The quality of singing
was brilliant, nothing less than I
had expected.
Yes, the show was longer than
I had anticipated, and unfor-
tunately my attention began
to wane as it went on. But that
doesn't take anything away
from the quality of the produc-
tion - it just so happened that I
was slightly under the weather. I
would liketotakethis opportuni-
ty to apologize to my fellow view-
ers sitting next to me; I doubt my
intermittent coughing and sneez-
ing at surprisingly well-timed (or
rather, ill-timed) moments was
appreciated. Initially I thought
they were clearing their throats
because of similar health prob-
lems, but when long, focused
glares in my direction accompa-
nied each of their ahems, I began
to have differing thoughts. How-
ever, no major damage was done,
since the show is full of moments
that keep the audiences smiling
and laughingthroughout.
As the curtains closed and
the cast took their bows, I real-
ized that my blocked nose need-
ed some immediate attention.
I made a beeline for the nearest
restroom, but not before I navi-
gated my way through a crowd
of very pleased theatergoers.
Yes, I agree - the play was won-
derful, but I wasn't really con-
cerned with that right now. A
couple of minutes later, I walked
out, temporarily free of my nasal
problems and in a much better
state to savor my first theatri-
cal experience. I felt content at
having experienced my first play
and left the formerly dim theater
with a bright smile. I did happen
to meet the usher on the way out,
and conveyed my ample satisfac-
tion and gratefulness. Indeed,
the show was quite good.

In the heart of Ann Arbor, theater. over the years, it has
amid the hustle and bustle of won a wide variety of awards
restaurants, shops and cafes, and nominations, garnering
Performance Network Theatre national recognition and lead-
is the perfect centerpiece for an ing the artistic quality and play
elegant night in town. Founded selection in Michigan.
in 1981, PNT has grown from Currently celebrating its
a fledgling company to Ann 32nd year, PNT showcases seven
Arbor's resident professional shows each season that range

from world-premier plays by
both local and national play-
wrights to Broadway musicals.
The company's performanc-
es have been recognized in all
aspects -of theater, including
best acting, design and new
script. In 2009 and 2011, PNT
was nationally acclaimed for
attaining the Edgerton Founda-
tion New American Play Award
for performances of "Dead
Man's Shoes" and "It Came
From Mars."
"Performance Network has
transformed from a number of
performers and organizations
that brought dance companies,
musicians, clowning and theater
to the organization and turned it
into what is now a theater," said
Logan Ricket, associate develop-
ment director at PNT.
In addition to its year-round
professional productions, PNT
runs the Children's Theatre
Network to provide original
shows to entertain and educate
Ann Arbor's younger audience.
Through Children's Theatre
Network, PNT also arranges
theater workshops that teach
students creativity, problem-
solving skills and healthy self-
expression.
The Fireside New Play Fes-
tival is another means through
which PNT diversifies Ann
Arbor's entertainment palette.
The festival is a live stage read-
ing done by professional actors
and directors. The audience is
then allowed to provide feed-
back after the production. Pre-
sented three times each year,
the festival showcases the works
of new playwrights, providing
them with the opportunity to
have their work performed in
front of a real-life audience.
PNT also immerses itself into
the Ann Arbor community by
giving emerging and established
playwrights the opportunity to
work closely with actors and
directors through its Submit-A-
Script program. Through this
program, PNT not only serves
the role of a stepping stool for
new playwrights but also pro-
vides local playwrights the
chance to have their work exam-
ined on a professional level.
"We need new voices in con-

temporary American theater,"
said Erin Sabo, PNT's managing
director. "The reason why we are
a member of the National New
Play Network is so that we can
nurture new playwrights and
nurture the craft of American
theater." Sabo said the submis-
sion program provides writers
feedback and, occasionally, a
reading at the Fireside festival.
As a Commonweal Theatre,
PNT reaches out to more than
40,000 patrons every year in
order to keep a balanced bud-
get. As Sabo explained, under 50
percent of the non-profit PNT's
income comes from ticket sales.
The rest comes from individual
donors and grants.
"Some of it is through per-
sonal appeals made through
letters to some of our patrons,
our subscribers and community
members," Sabo said. "We gath-
er it by going to businesses who
we appreciate in the area and
ask them to either be an in-kind
sponsor - which means provid-
ing food donations at an opening
night - or a monetary spon-
sor, which is actually helping to
underwrite some of our produc-
tions."
Sabo said the theater's "cre-
ative and capable" staff serves
a crucial role in its success as a
theater organization.
As a non-profit, PNT is affiliat-
ed with the Actors' Equity Asso-
ciation of professional Actors
and Stage Managers. Therefore,
its primary purpose is not nec-
essarily to make a profit. Rather,
the money PNT earns is used to
develop the theater in order to
bring Broadway-quality perfor-
mances to Ann Arbor's doorstep.
Nevertheless, the more support
PNT gets from the community,
the more it's able do with the
art, and the more it's able to give
back.
For instance, PNT's partner-
ship with Ann Arbor's Elmo's
T-Shirts allows them to get dis-
counted rates on printing ser-
vices.
PNT relies on volunteer ush-
ers throughout the season for
all of its main stage productions
and special events, as well as
volunteers for administrative
tasks and assisting other aspects

of production. Individuals in
the community, Sabo said, have
donated costumes and props to
shows in addition to monetary
donations.
"In any way we can get sup-
port, we take it," Sabo said.
That support can be attrib-
uted to PNT's ability to provide
unyielding aesthetic leadership
in southeast Michigan over the
past 32 years.
"A lot of it begins with word of
mouth. We've been around Ann
Arbor since 1981 - we've been
around for 32 years. So, it's been
32 years of people coming to our
theater shows and loving what
we do and 32 years of somebody
telling their friend to tell their
friend, and it's also been 32 years
of us learning - learning what
grants are out there and where
we can get support from," Sabo
said.
As a leader of PNT, Sabo is a
member of the Cultural Leaders
Forum, which brings together
theater organizations once every
month to provide support and
offer ideas and advice to each
other. PNT is also a member of
the Michigan Equity Theatre
Alliance, which offers a similar
service to theater companies.
"Theater is a funny, com-
petitive business," Sabo said,
"where, yes, you want to com-
pete, you want to have the bet-
ter shows, but we are also - at.
the end of the day - doing some-
thing that we love. So we are all
very supportive of each other in
wanting the other to succeed."
As a non-profit theater orga-
nization struggling through
the economic recession, PNT is
fortunate enough to have a very
strong donor base that keeps
it alive and functioning well.
However, it's also through the
talent of PNT's board members
and staff that the organization
is able to deliver high-caliber
entertainment to Ann Arbor
audiences.
"It's more important for us to
make sure that we are support-
ing the local artists in Michigan
and helping them have a career
in theater and not having to
leave the state," Sabo said. "That
balance is a fine line that some-
times keeps me up at night."
