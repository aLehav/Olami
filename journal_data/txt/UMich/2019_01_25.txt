Katie Wolberg returned to 
campus after winter break filled 
with anticipation. As a second-
semester 
LSA 
freshman, 
she 
resolved to explore her developing 
interest in consulting, excited by 

the prospect of what joining a firm 
offered her: a network, a group of 
friends and a community at the 
University of Michigan. Despite 
Katie’s interest in data analytics 
and consulting, her anticipation 
quickly turned into disappointment 
when she was met with rejection at 
some of the top consulting clubs 
on campus, cutting short her 

opportunity to engage in this new 
atmosphere.
“I’m planning on transferring 
to the School of Information,” 
Wolberg said. “I’m interested in 
maybe consulting in the future, 
or doing something in the tech 
industry, and I thought [joining 
a club] would be a really good 
opportunity to meet new people 

and expand my network … and then 
it fell through and now I’m like, ‘Do 
I need to rethink what I’m doing?’”
Campus clubs and organizations 
are an integral part of the college 
experience. With more than 1,600 
clubs at the University, students are 
afforded the opportunity to engage 
in a myriad of activities. 

Pulitzer Prize-winning author 
James Forman Jr., a law professor 
at Yale University, discussed 
mass incarceration, government 
intervention 
and 
systemic 
inequalities within the criminal 
justice 
system 
Thursday 
in 
Weiser Hall. About 150 students 
and faculty gathered for this 
event, organized by the Donia 
Human Rights Center Annual 
Martin Luther King, Jr. Lecture.
Forman 
spoke 
about 
his 
Pulitzer 
Prize-winning 
book 
“Locking Up Our Own: Crime 
and 
Punishment 
in 
Black 
America” and the historical 
context that details a past 
of 
African-American 
mass 
incarceration and intense law 
enforcement implemented by the 
government in response to issues 
within the African-American 
community.
After law school, Forman 
worked as a public defender in 
Washington D.C. He described 
a particular case in which he 
defended a 15-year-old who plead 
guilty to possession of a gun and 
a small amount of marijuana.

Student group dedicated to improving living standards in Pakistan hosts event

Just a few days after Julia Putnam 
and Tim Wise delivered a keynote 
address at the Reverend Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr. Day Symposium, 
Paani partnered with eight other 

cultural 
organizations 
at 
the 
University of Michigan for “Culture 
Night” to raise awareness about 
the sanitation issues facing their 
respective countries and to share 
their unique cultures.
Paani is an organization that focuses 
on improving the living standards 
in Pakistan through bettering the 

environment 
and 
implementing 
clean health technologies, especially 
through building wells, inputting 
clean energy sources and working 
with health clinics. Pakistan is 
currently undergoing the world’s 
third worst water crisis, with the 
prime minister predicting the country 
to have no more clean water by 2025.

More than 100 students filled the 
Rackham Assembly Hall as Paani 
and the Bangladeshi, Egyptian, Iraqi, 
Jordanian, 
Lebanese, 
Pakistani, 
Persian 
and 
Yemeni 
student 
associations shared various aspects 
of their culture, including food, 
dance and traditional clothing.

Construction 
projects 
and 
campus expansion pose concerns 
among 
student 
organizations 
about reaching the University 
of Michigan’s goal of a 25 
percent reduction in carbon and 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2025.
LSA junior Julian Hansen is 
the founder of the U-M Climate 
Action 
Movement, 
a 
student 
organization dedicated to pushing 
for campus carbon neutrality. 
According to Hansen, the power 
plant expansion poses concerns for 
reducing emissions.
“Since the initial announcement, 
there has not been much very 
vocal progress,” Hansen said. 
“But one thing is the expansion of 
the Central Power Plant, which 
Schlissel says will take us halfway 
to our 2025 goal, but all in all we are 
a bit nervous about the expansion 
because it has been shown a lot 
once you really heavily invest we 
will be unlikely to divest in a time 
that will fulfill CAM’s goal.”
Engineering 
junior 
Logan 
Vear, Climate Action Movement 
member, further expanded on 
the concerns of the power plant 
expansion.

The current shutdown of the 
federal government has lasted 33 
days so far, making it the longest 
shutdown in U.S. history. With 
no set end date, the shutdown has 
begun impacting finances, both 
at home and in the workplace. 
These impacts have prompted 
a number of local responses 
from 
Michigan 
government 
representatives and from those 
on campus. 
The federal shutdown began 
on Dec. 22, 2018 after Congress 
members failed to agree on a 
border security deal. President 
Donald Trump has shut down 
the government, saying he won’t 
reopen it until he receives a 
payment plan for the Mexico-
United 
States 
border 
wall. 
Democrats in Congress refuse 
to accept his offer, and House 
Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said the 
State of the Union Address would 
not be held until the president 
reopens the government.
In an interview with Michigan 

News, 
Matthew 
Shapiro, 
professor of Economics at the 
University of Michigan, said this 
shutdown is far different than the 
one in 2013 because there is no 
end in sight. He explained those 
affected have delayed paying bills, 
including paying their mortgage, 
because doing so helped them 
financially 
during 
the 
2013 
government shutdown. However, 
through a study he conducted 
with fellow researchers, Shapiro 
determined delaying payments 
will do far more harm than good, 
as it will cause serious trauma to 
workers’ finances in the long run.
Michigan 
Gov. 
Gretchen 
Whitmer teamed up with Govs. 
Andrew Cuomo of New York 
and Jay Inslee of Washington to 
release a joint statement asking 
for individual states to grant 
unemployment benefits to federal 
workers who attend work without 
compensation. The Department 
of Labor has told workers they 
are not technically unemployed 
and therefore do not qualify for 
unemployment benefits.

LSA freshman Liat Weinstein on her story “MESA facilitators lead peer-
led teach-in to oppose racism, inequality on campus:

“My favorite person I got to interview was probably one of the peer leaders for MESA, Ade, 
who ran the session. He gave some really interesting quotes about why it was important 
ot teach about racism, especially today, and to teach undergraduate students about their 
roles in recognizing racist incidents in their communities.” 

“There were only about six students at this event, which I think made it even more powerful 
because they were all talking one-on-one about racist incidents in their communities and 
actions that have impacted them personally. It wasn’t so much like a panel discussion 
with a large group of people in an auditorium. There was definitely some space for 
disagreement.”

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
When we remember Dr. King, of course we do it 
selectively, don’t we? We pick out only the pretty and the easy 
parts, the simple parts, the one line from one speech. You know 
the speech and you know the line, the one about judging 
people by the content of their character not the color of their 
skin. That is the easiest, least radical, least revolutionary thing 
Dr. King has ever said. That’s why we pull that one out. ”

Tim Wise, anti-racism activist and writer, during his keynote speech at the Martin Luther King Jr. Symposium Memorial Lecture

“We are a little skeptical 
for us committing to a 25 
percent reduction and saying 
that we will get there by doing 
this central campus power 
plant expansion,” Vear said. 
“The reason for that is given 
that this would commit us to 
using natural gas directly on 
our campus, and that could 
potentially lock us in for more 
years than we would hope, to 
later inhibit us to potentially 
getting 
to 
that 
carbon 
neutrality goal. The campus 
plant expansion is somewhat 
opposing to a commitment to 
carbon neutrality.”
According 
to 
Andrew 
Berki, director of the Office 
of Campus Sustainability, the 
University has found success 
in reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions despite significant 
campus expansion.
“From 2006 to 2018, we 
really 
invested 
in 
energy 
conservation in our buildings 
on 
campus,” 
Berki 
said. 
“We’ve 
seen 
a 
reduction 
of 50,000 metric tons over 
that time. Over that same 
time 
period, 
our 
campus 
has grown in infrastructure 
over 20 percent, so if you 
think about that, we’ve really 
made 
tremendous 
strides 

in energy conservation in 
existing buildings and new 
construction by mitigating 
carbon creep, even through 
tremendous campus growth.”
Berki said measures such 
as 
gathering 
energy 
and 
water conservation reports, 
as well as calling for energy 
audits, are considered when 
planning any campus building 
or expansion project.
“All construction projects 
mitigate 
greenhouse 
gas 
emissions 
through 
energy 
conservation 
measures 
and 
water 
conservation 
measures,” 
Berki 
said. 
“We use a number of these 
different 
both 
statewide 
regulations 
and 
internal 
regulations and policies we’ve 
put in place to try and make 
sure our buildings are built as 
efficiently as possible.”
After the announcement 
of the Central Power Plant 
expansion in October, Berki 
said the project would push 
greenhouse 
gas 
reduction 
efforts 
to 
about 
halfway 
toward 
their 
25 
percent 
decrease goal.
“It takes time to develop 
strategies and to get those 
strategies approved, and I’m 
happy to say we have a couple 
strategies that we really think 
are going to get us to that goal 
actually ahead of schedule,” 
Berki said. “One of those is 

the expansion of our central 
power plant where we’re 
going to add a 50-megawatt 
turbine to increase natural 
gas, increase the capacity 
of our natural gas plant, 
and reduce the amount of 
electricity that we’re buying 
from DTE, so that is going to 
get us about halfway towards 
our goal.”
In a Jan. 13 interview, 
University President Mark 
Schlissel expanded on the 
University’s 
utilization 
of 
the Leadership in Energy 
and Environmental Design 
certification 
program, 
a 
rating system that looks at the 
energy efficiency of building 
designs. The LEED system 
attempts to create efficient, 
cost-saving green buildings.
“We’ve established energy 
efficiency 
standards 
for 
our 
buildings 
and 
we’ve 
established a commitment to 
use the LEED certification 
program to shoot for a certain 
minimum level, if not exceed 
a certain level, of LEED 
certification, all of which 
are designed to diminish the 
energy needs of a building.”
According 
to 
Vear, 
the 
LEED program highlights a 
weakness in the University’s 
efforts to aggressively reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions.
“When it comes to our 
expansion 
on 
campus 
in general and all the 
construction going on — a 
lot of that currently, our 
standard is only LEED 
silver 
for 
sustainability 
measures 
for 
any 
new 
construction, 
and 
that 
has 
been 
demonstrated 
over the past few years 
to 
not 
be 
the 
most 
aggressive and the most 
beneficial measure to be 
taking in order to truly 
be sustainable and reduce 
emissions 
effectively,” 
Vear said.
According 
to 
Berki, 
Schlissel’s 
announced 
commission 
to 
create 
a timeline and distinct 
goals for the University 
to reach carbon neutrality 
is the next big step for 
the 
University’s 
efforts 
to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions.
“I think that commission 
is 
being 
formed 
right 
now, so the membership 
scope 
and 
schedule 
of 
that 
commission 
is 
being 
formed 
by 
the 
president, and we expect 

an announcement very soon, 
what that’s going to look 
like, and that’s really the 
next step,” Berki said. “So 
that commission is going to 
be tasked with developing 
strategies and plans to submit 
to him on how to put the 
University on a track towards 
carbon neutrality.”
Berki 
also 
said 
the 
commission 
would 
be 
a 
benefit 
not 
only 
to 
the 
University, 
but 
to 
the 
nationwide effort to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions as 
a whole.
“The president has made it 
clear that this commission is 
not only going to look at our 
own campus footprint, but 
it’s going to be tasked with 
developing technologies that 
can be transferable beyond 

the University of Michigan 
borders,” Berki said.
Schlissel 
said 
the 
University is in a perfect 
position to aid others with 
the 
findings 
of 
his 
new 
commission.
“At an academic institution, 
we’re in a great spot to solve 
the problem for us in a way 
that others can take what 
we’ve learned and come up 
with and tested and use it for 
themselves,” Schlissel said.
Despite construction and 
campus expansion, Berki said 
he still expects to achieve 
their goal of 25 percent 
reduced emissions by early 
2025.
“We’re going to meet our 
goal ahead of schedule,” 
Berki said. “I would say 
early 2020s, and the next 
step is to figure out how to 
do more, how to get on the 
path 
towards 
neutrality, 
and the commission is going 
to be taken with doing so.”

CARBON 
From Page 1


On Jan. 23, U.S. Reps. Debbie 
Dingell, D-Ann Arbor, and Fred 
Upton, R-St. Joseph, introduced 
emergency legislation called the 
Pay Federal Workers Act allowing 
states to make unemployment 
benefits available for these unpaid 
federal workers during government 
shutdowns. 
The federal shutdown also means 
several agencies in Washington, 
D.C., have been closed indefinitely. 
This has caused a backup in 
workflow, especially as it pertains 
to the reception of proposals from 
lobbyists to legislators.
Cynthia 
Wilbanks, 
vice 
president of government relations 
at the University, spends her time 
working closely with lobbyists both 
locally and in Washington, D.C. She 
has found members of Congress are 
still present during this situation, 
but some agencies are closed.
“The members of Congress are 
still quite accessible,” Wilbanks 
said. “We have not experienced a 
delay or any particular issues with 
respect to members of Congress. 
Their offices are open. … Some 
of the agencies, however, are not 
considered essential, so they are 
being impacted if they were not 
funded in the regular appropriation 
cycle.”
Wilbanks recalled one employee 
telling her how sometimes there 
is no one in certain departments 
to receive their project in grant 
proposals. She advised her to still 

observe deadlines in the hopes 
that when the government does 
reopen, they recieve responses to 
their work as close to on schedule 
as possible.
“I was advising one faculty 
member, she was working on 
a proposal that needed to be 
submitted, and her agency —the 
agency that she’s submitting it 
to — is technically not working,” 
Wilbanks said. “And I said, ‘Don’t 
miss the deadline,’ because the last 
thing you want is not submitting it 
on time.”
One of the main priorities in 
Wilbanks’ division is research. 
The University is the largest 
public research university and has 
been impacted by the shutdown. 
Wilbanks is helping her staff work 
around the shutdown, though the 
longer the uncertainty continues, 
the harder it is for her staff to 
continue their projects.
“The shutdown is certainly 
problematic — it leaves a lot 
of 
uncertainty,” 
Wilbanks 
said. “Most of our researchers 
and 
administration 
itself 
are 
considering how to bridge the 
current situation with(out) the 
support that keeps many of these 
programs and projects going, but 
by now, I’m pretty sure that just 
in any course of action that we 
might think about the course that 
says, ‘Well, we’ll be shut down for 
another 30 or 60 days’ will start 
to have ripple effects and impact a 
number of people at the University. 
It’s just hard to know which ones.”

After the boy was found 
guilty 
and 
sentenced 
by 
a 
Black 
judge, 
Forman 
recognized 
what 
he 
saw 
as 
an 
African-American 
jurisdiction 
incarcerating 
their own. 
Forman 
stated 
that 
in 
D.C. at the time of this 
trial, 40 percent of judges 
in the Supreme Court were 
African-American, the City 
Council and police force were 
primarily Black, the mayor at 
the time was Black, as well as 
the chief prosecutor.
“Even 
with 
all 
that 
representation 
of 
local 
government, we were doing 
the same thing that everyone 
else was doing around the 
country,” 
Forman 
said. 
“Passing 
the 
same 
laws, 
enacting the same policies, 
with 
the 
same 
results. 
I 
told you that one third of 
young Black men were under 
criminal justice supervision 
nationally, at the time in D.C., 
it was one in two.”
Forman spoke about his 
research reading constituent 
letters 
from 
African 
Americans 
to 
government 
representatives 
regarding 
drug and crime concerns in 
their neighborhoods during 
the 1960s and ’70s. Forman 
attained 
the 
letters 
from 
retired local politicians who 
saved these papers.
“The 
generation 
of 
people 
that 
are 
receiving 
these letters are the first 
generation of Black elected 
officials to be elected in any 
number in this country since 
Reconstruction,” 
Forman 

said. “All of them remember 
the long history of under-
enforcement 
and 
under-
protection of the law that’s 
been a hallmark of the Black 
experience in this country 
since slavery.”
Forman spoke about the 
rise 
in 
heroin 
addiction 
in the 1960s and how the 
government responded with 
increasing the presence of law 
enforcement. 
According 
to 
Forman, when David Clarke, 
one of two white members 
of the original city council, 
received concern about heroin 
addiction in public spaces, 
the problem was sent to the 
police 
department, 
where 
law 
enforcement 
response 
trumped 
a 
public 
health 
response.
Forman attributed Clarke’s 
response to the epidemic as a 
“constraint of imagination,” 
a 
constraint 
that 
Forman 
characterized as stigmas and 
stereotypes surrounding the 
Black community.
“Because, 
of 
course, 
if 
the problem is addicts in 
public space, you would send 
people 
whose 
only 
tools 
are handcuffs, and the only 
place they can take you is 
the local jail where there is 
no treatment,” Forman said. 
“And David Clarke wasn’t a 
bad guy, but his imagination 
was constrained.”
Forman 
acknowledged 
a 
history 
of 
white-
dominated 
governments 
which increasingly led to 
unfavorable decisions toward 
African Americans passed in 
the government.
“Institutionalized 
white 
supremacy 
in 
government 
and law and policy for over 85 
percent of American history 

and that has an impact that 
manifested itself in decisions 
up and down the government, 
decisions 
to 
systematically 
deprive Black communities 
and 
Black 
citizens 
of 
resources,” Forman said.
Forman mentioned the past 
decisions made in government 
which 
resulted 
in 
law 
enforcement’s dependency to 
respond to disparities present 
in the Black community.
“The communities that were 
asking for protection, that 
these newly elected officials 
were elected to represent, 
lacked 
the 
resources 
to 
protect themselves so they 
were unduly reliant on the 
state, they were unduly reliant 
on police and prosecutors 
for protection,” Forman said. 
“It’s those tiny decisions that 
are individual bricks that 
collectively have built up the 
prison nation that we have 
become.”
Public 
Policy 
junior 
Lena Dreves said she found 
Forman’s 
analysis 
of 
the 
system as a whole particularly 
interesting.
“I think it’s really important 
how he really constructively 
criticized 
each 
actor 
and 
piece in a way where he’s not 
putting all the blame on one 
piece of the entire system,” 
Dreves said.
Forman went on to discuss 
the solutions he sees to the 
problem of mass incarceration 
in the United States, including 
action on a local level.
“It is tempting to look at 
speeches of presidents and 
acts of Congress, but it is just 
as crucial to look at acts at 
the local level,” Forman said. 
“Even though what happens 
in Washington gets so much 

attention, 
actually 
what 
happens in states and counties 
and cities is more important 
for 
pushing 
back 
against 
mass 
incarceration 
than 
anything that’s happening in 
Washington, D.C. And so we 
can’t let the media attention 
drive our activism and drive 
our analysis of the problem or 
of the solutions.”
The right to serve on a jury 
has been central to the civil 
rights struggle in the United 
States, and Forman suggested 
voting on a jury is crucial to 
making change.
“Understand the power you 
can have as a juror … Use the 
jury box as a site of politics,” 
Forman said.
Public Policy senior Drea 
Somers said individuals who 
work together can play a role 
to alter the structure of an 
institutionalized system.
“Movement 
building 
is 
super 
important,” 
Somers 
said. “It is a lot of hard 
work. … Mass incarceration 
is a daunting system, but 
with a few good people and 
intentional work, we can all 
chip away at the structure.”
Forman 
concluded 
the 
lecture with a quote from his 
father, an advocate during the 
civil rights movement, who 
worked with Martin Luther 
King Jr.
“What 
you 
have 
to 
understand is that we were 
fighting knowing that the 
change may not take place 
in our lifetime. … We were 
fighting for 10,000 days from 
tomorrow,” 
Forman 
said. 
“And we were fighting for 
freedom because fighting for 
freedom in an unjust system 
is what makes you human.”

The 
evening 
included 
a 
presentation, 
traditional 
dance performances from the 
Yemeni Students’ Association 
and 
the 
Iraqi 
Student 
Association 
among 
other 
events.
Business junior Sikander 
Khan, the director of strategy 
and 
operations 
for 
Paani, 
explained 
how 
the 
event 
developed after the various 
organizations realized they 
all had common challenges 
with 
sanitation 
in 
their 
respective countries.
“We 
found 
a 
bunch 
of 
different 
cultural 
organizations 
that 
all 
struggle 
with 
the 
same 
common 
struggle, 
which 
was sanitation conditions,” 
Khan said. “So we reached 
out to these different orgs 
and they were very excited 
about working together to 
raise awareness about these 
humanitarian 
crises 
going 
on and just bringing people 
together to experience their 
culture.”
The event began with a 
presentation about Paani and 
how their original mission 
of building wells in Pakistan 
developed into a wider effort 
to make use of all University 
resources to tackle the issue. 
One of these efforts was 
establishing a public health 
curriculum 
in 
Pakistan 
to 
teach 
children 
about 
sanitation. It also touched 
on the intersectionality of 
the 
sanitation 
issues 
and 
how it impacts countries and 
individuals all around the 
world — specifically Yemen, 
which has a total population 
of 28 million people, with 
19 million of those people 
without access to water.
LSA 
freshman 
Shanmin 
Sultana, director of internal 
affairs for Paani, elaborated 
on the intersectionality of 
the 
sanitation 
issue 
and 
discussed 
how 
Paani’s 
mission expanded.
“Initially, we were very 
focused 
on 
Pakistan, 
but 
we noticed a lot of other 
countries, especially in the 
Middle East and in South 
Asia, 
were 
also 
suffering 
from water crises like us,” 
Sultana said. “We wanted to 
come together and highlight 
that this water crisis is not 
just central to Pakistan, it’s 
a universal crisis in many 
countries. We wanted to show 
that while we stand primarily 
in Pakistan, we stand in 
solidarity 
with 
all 
these 
countries that are suffering 
with 
sanitation 
related 
crises.”
After 
the 
presentation, 
the event began to showcase 
traditional dances performed 
by 
the 
Yemeni 
Students’ 
Association and the Iraqi 

Student 
Association. 
The 
event also included a “best 
dressed” competition, which 
allowed attendees to show off 
cultural clothing.
LSA 
sophomore 
Alana 
Phillips heard about the event 
through a friend. She said 
she appreciated the chance 
to learn more about different 
student groups and cultures.
“I think it’s a good way 
for people to learn about 
different cultures, different 
experiences 
that 
link 
together different parts of the 
world that can get overlooked 
sometimes,” Phillips said. “It 
brings out the good things.”
Khan 
also 
emphasized 
another important aspect of 
the event was showcasing 
the positive aspects of each 
country because many have 
been demonized by popular 
media. He hoped the event 
would offer others the chance 
to learn more about different 
cultures.
“By 
bringing 
all 
these 
different 
people 
together 
who kind have been pushed 
to the side culture wise and 
human wise, it just gives us 
a good opportunity to come 
together,” Khan said.
LSA junior Mehrin Ahmed, 

Bangladeshi 
Students 

Association marketing chair, 
echoed Khan’s sentiment and 
discussed how even though it 
is important to acknowledge 
the challenges their countries 
face, it is also important to 
celebrate their beauty.
“We don’t want to dismiss 
the issues,” Ahmed said. “We 
know they exist and we’re 
here to shed light and bring 
awareness, 
but 
also 
have 
the positive on the sidelines 
and show that despite these 
challenges, 
despite 
the 
struggles we face, we’re still 
here. Our vibrance — it’s 
outshining everything.”
Moving forward, Phillips 
hopes the University will 
support more events hosted 
by communities of color and 
encourage more students to 
attend them.
“They can bring the events 
to light,” Phillips said. “Also 
encouraging 
them 
(the 
events) to be in spaces where 
more kids are going to see 
them, where students are 
going to see them, because we 
get overlooked when they’re 
not in spaces you’re going to 
see other students here at the 
University.”
Ahmed also touched on the 
importance of representing 
different 
communities 
on 
campus 
and 
encouraged 
ongoing team work.
“We exist,” Ahmed said. 
“Not just our struggles and not 
just the things we celebrate, 
but solely our existence does 
not get the traction we’d hope 
for on this campus. We’d hope 
that a community like this 
would bring people together 
in a comfortable manner.”

But 
many 
pre-professional 
organizations 
require 
intensive 
application processes that make 
membership extremely exclusive. 
Competitive 
admissions 
are 
especially prevalent in business-
oriented, 
pre-professional 
organizations, including consulting 
groups, 
investment 
firms 
and 
business fraternities. Applications 
often require written supplements, 
interviews and multiple rounds of 
“cuts,” yielding an extensive process 
of new member selection.
A 
growing 
sentiment 
of 
frustration has developed among 
portions of the student body due to 
the highly selective nature of these 
clubs, which reject a majority of 
initial applicants before welcoming 
new members.
LSA 
junior 
Andrew 
Levey 
discussed how his own experience 
with rejection from a campus 
consulting firm led him to create 
Alliance Consulting Group, an 
organization dedicated to providing 
all students with an opportunity to 
learn about consulting.
“I tried to become interested 
in the consulting industry in the 
beginning of my sophomore year,” 
Levey said. “I applied to a lot of the 
Ross consulting clubs to see if I could 
learn about the industry and get 
some real-world experience doing 
so, and I found that these clubs are 
really, really hard to get into if you 
don’t know anything about what’s 
called a case interview.”
In a case interview, an applicant 

is presented with a hypothetical 
business 
scenario 
that 
the 
interviewee 
must 
assess 
and 
propose a solution to. Consulting 
clubs often utilize this interview 
style to assess potential members.
Levey went on to discuss how 
Alliance Consulting combats a 
culture of exclusivity by focusing 
on new member education and 
developing skills for consulting, 
including how to complete a 
successful case interview.
“I thought it was unfair that 
people who don’t know about an 
industry are assessed on a learned 
skill they don’t know,” Levey said. 
“I felt that there needed to be a club 
on campus for students who, even if 
they don’t know what consulting is, 
if they want to become interested in 
it, they can have the opportunity to 
do so.” 
Business junior Thejas Suvarna, 
president of APEX Consulting 
Group, one of the most selective 
consulting groups, stated that in an 
effort to provide all students with an 
equal opportunity to succeed in the 
recruitment process, case interview 
workshops are held to explain what 
they are and provide applicants 
with examples of how to approach 
problems. APEX Consulting Group 
focuses 
on 
offering 
pro-bono 
consulting for local Ann Arbor 
businesses and is known to have 
selective membership.
“At the end of the day, we really 
emphasize that while there’s a 
formal name to this case interview, 
really it’s just a way to gauge your 
thought process and see how you 
break down a problem, and those 
are inherent traits people will have,” 

Suvarna said.
“We do so much work with 
clients and we have to manage 
those relationships,” Suvarna said. 
“Clients give us their personal 
information. We have to make sure 
that we’re respecting their privacy 
and serving them a purpose and 
doing a good job, and it’s not feasible 
for us to do that well with a club 
that’s too big for us to manage.”
Suvarna went on to discuss the 
firm’s applicant selection process 
is based on anonymity to ensure a 
more holistic process at large.
“Our 
application 
process 
is 
completely anonymous,” Suvarna 
said. “We go through and read the 
responses to our essays because, for 
us, what is most important is, ‘Did 
these people do their homework and 
learn about what APEX has to offer? 
Is there a legitimate reason that they 
want to be in APEX, to contribute to 
the community rather than to just 
use it as a step to the next thing?’ 
That all comes first.”
Ed Huebner, assistant director 
of Counseling and Psychological 
Services, noted the positive aspects 
of selective clubs, as they instill a 
strong sense of community among 
members within a large campus.
“I think the idea goes back to 
connection and feeling a sense 
of belonging — and that could be 
belonging to a group, a club, an 
organization or a department,” 
Huebner said. “There’s a sense of 
identity that can come from feeling 
like, ‘This is my group, this is my 
connection, these are my people, 
and from that there’s a closeness 
that we feel.’”
Huebner discussed how the 

feeling of belonging contributes 
to the mental health of students 
on campus, both positively and 
negatively.
“For a lot of our students that 
come in, this can be a very big 
place,” Huebner said. “So that idea 
of, ‘Who can I connect with and feel 
belonging with?’ on campus ends 
up being a really big factor when it 
comes to their mental health.”
Norm Bishara, the associate dean 
for undergraduate programs at the 
Ross School of Business, provided 
an email statement on behalf of 
the Business School discussing 
how success on a college campus 
goes beyond admission to any one 
organization.
“The clubs provide benefits to 
students by creating opportunities 
for 
leadership 
and 
real-world 
experiences, 
offering 
fellowship 
and a like-minded community, and 
creating positive impact,” Bishara 
wrote in the email. “… We recognize 
that the student leaders of some 
clubs have implemented competitive 
application processes. While clubs 
and student organizations are an 
important part of the Michigan 
Ross experience, student success is 
independent of participation in any 
single club or activity on campus.”
Business junior Jack Geiger, vice 
president of clubs for the Bachelor 
of 
Business 
Administration 
Council, 
said 
the 
competitive 
nature of business-oriented clubs 
is appropriate, given the rigorous 
work students participate in once 
admitted.

Frustrated with Israel? America needs to look in the mirrror

ZACK BLUMBERG | COLUMN

I

n January of this year, 

Jonathan Weisman of the 

New York Times published 

an interesting article detailing 

what he described as the “Great 

Schism” — a sharp ideological 

divide rapidly forming between 

American 
and 
Israeli 
Jews 

over 
Israel’s 
ideology. 
Now, 

schisms 
don’t 
just 
magically 

appear — they stem from intense 

polarization regarding an issue. 

In this situation, American and 

Israeli Jews disagree over Israel’s 

foreign 
policy 
under 
Prime 

Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, 

who has taken a more aggressive 

stance 
against 
Palestinians, 

seemingly 
shifting 
from 
a 

diplomatic approach to a military 

one. Last year, Netanyahu said 

he did not think a Palestinian 

state should ever have control 

of its own security measures, a 

sentiment which was reflected 

in decreasing support for a two-

state 
solution 
among 
Israeli 

citizens, which dropped from 

47 percent in 2017 to 43 percent 

in 2018. Israel’s changing stance 

regarding Palestine brings up 

a simple question: Why? The 

parameters of the dispute itself 

haven’t changed in recent years, 

and the number of fatalities on 

both sides has actually been 

decreasing.

In reality, Israel’s increased 

antipathy stems from decisions 

the United States has made. 

The 
U.S. 
has 
continuously 

supported 
Israel 
financially 

ever since its creation in 1948. 

Originally, this was a necessary 

step for protecting a U.S. ally 

that needed aid. However, U.S. 

financial 
assistance 
toward 

Israel has since spiraled into 

unconditional, 
consequence-

free support for the Middle 

Eastern nation, allowing it to 

do as it pleases with nearly no 

repercussions. Every year since 

1978, the U.S. has given Israel at 

least a billion dollars in aid, and 

every year since 1983 it has been 

at least $2.4 billion. For the U.S., 

unconditional aid to this degree, 

especially military aid, is largely 

unique to Israel. The only two 

countries the U.S. gave more aid 

to last year were Afghanistan 

and Iraq, both countries where 

there are active troops.

Fundamentally, 
I 
believe 

in the idea of a Jewish state. 

However, it is important to 

distinguish between believing 

something 
should 
exist 
and 

supporting 
it 
unconditionally 

with 
billions 
of 
dollars, 

especially if it might violate 

human 
rights. 
It 
is 
hardly 

surprising that Israel has taken 

a more militant stance towards 

Palestine recently considering 

the U.S. has given Israel the 

green light to do what it pleases. 

Since 2000, there have been a 

total of 7,065 Palestinians killed 

in the Israel-Palestine conflict, 

compared to only 1,101 Israelis, 

meaning 
88 
percent 
of 
the 

deaths have been Palestinians. 

Additionally, 
numerous 

reports have come out alleging 

Israel has used institutional 

torture 
against 
Palestinians. 

While these abuses are overly 

aggressive 
and 
unacceptable, 

the U.S. continues to simply 

give Israel billions of dollars in 

military aid. Without so much 

as a verbal condemnation, let 

alone a financial threat, there is 

no incentive for Israel to change 

its ways. Those who encourage 

protests against Israel are often 

accused of holding Israel to 

a higher standard than other 

countries, but holding Israel to 

a higher standard is seemingly 

fair: The U.S. contributes far 

more money to Israel than to 

nearly any other country, so 

it is reasonable to have higher 

expectations for it.

This brings us to our final 

question: Why such staunch 

support 
for 
Israel? 
The 

United States has never been 

particularly 
concerned 
with 

ethics or human rights when 

making foreign policy decisions 

in the past (see Iran, Nicaragua, 

Chile or many other countries), 

instead prioritizing things like 

cheaper 
access 
to 
resources 

like oil. With Israel, it would be 

logical to assume this support 

would come from Jews — Israel 

is a Jewish state, after all. 

Surprisingly, however, this is far 

from the case.

Backing for Israel is not solely 

based on collegial support from 

Jews, but can also be partially 

attributed to Islamophobia from 

white, conservative Americans, 

particularly 
evangelical 

Christians, many of whom see 

support for Israel as a way 

of 
opposing 
Muslims 
and 

Muslim 
states. 
When 
asked 

to rate Muslims on a “feeling 

thermometer,” Jews (who skew 

heavily Democratic) rated them 

a 51 out of 100, slightly above 

the overall average of a 48 

ranked by U.S. adults overall. 

On 
the 
other 
hand, 
white 

evangelicals rated Muslims a 37, 

lower than any other surveyed 

group. The disdain for Muslims 

among conservative voters, in 

particular white evangelicals, 

subsequently leads to strong 

support from Americans. In 

the 2018 midterms, 75 percent 

of 
white 
evangelicals 
voted 

for 
Republican 
candidates 

in elections for the House 

of Representatives. Both the 

Republican Party as a whole 

and 
white 
evangelicals 
are 

strongly supportive of Israel, 

with 79 percent of Republicans 

saying they sympathized with 

Israel (versus only 27 percent of 

Democrats). Most tellingly, 46 

percent of white evangelicals 

said the U.S. was not doing 

enough to help Israel, while 

only 31 percent of Jews and 25 

percent of the general public felt 

the same.

Lastly, perhaps even more 

worrying than the evangelical 

right’s ideological support of 

Israel is how willing everyone 

else is to go along with it. Over 

the course of the past year, 

there has been support from 

members of both the Democratic 

and 
Republican 
parties 
for 

passing a bill to make it illegal 

for 
companies 
to 
boycott 

Israel, a blatant violation of 

the First Amendment. The bill, 

literally titled the “Israel Anti-

Boycott Act,” would allow the 

government to fine organizations 

up to $1 million for boycotting 

Israel and other nations the U.S. 

has not officially sanctioned a 

boycott against.

As a Jew myself, writing 

this piece was a difficult and 

upsetting endeavor. I support 

a Jewish state in theory, and 

I want to be able to fully 

support one in reality as well. I 

understand the political climate 

makes Israel a tough place to 

govern.

However, it still saddens me 

to see a Jewish state operating 

on many values I, as a fellow 

Jew, do not agree with. I want 

to see an Israel that is governed 

on hope and a willingness to 

compromise, not on entrenched 

views of xenophobia. Here in the 

United States, I want an Israel 

that is supported not because 

we fear or dislike Muslims, but 

rather because we are tolerant, 

loving and accepting. As it is 

said in Leviticus 19:34, “The 

foreigner residing among you 

must be treated as your native-

born. Love them as yourself, for 

you were foreigners in Egypt.”

O

n Jan. 13, Gillette, a 

titan in men’s razors 

that 
has 
toted 
the 

macho “The Best a Man Can 

Get” 
tagline 
for 
decades, 

uploaded an advertisement to 

YouTube titled, “We Believe: 

The Best Men Can Be.” The ad 

challenges men to be better in 

an age where people attribute 

bullying and harassment to 

“toxic masculinity” and the 

#MeToo movement saturates 

headlines. The backlash was 

instantaneous. 
Gillette’s 

YouTube video faced almost 

double the number of dislikes 

as likes, and the comment 

section is filled with comments 

such as “I will not apologize for 

being a man,” “Never gonna buy 

Gillette ever again,” and “I am a 

woman, and I refuse to support 

a brand that insult(s) men so …” 

It’s clear America isn’t united 

behind Gillette on this issue.

The 
central 
thesis 
of 

Gillette’s ad seems noble and 

well-intended; being a man 

at his best means upholding 

what is right and showing 

compassion for others. Who 

wouldn’t 
support 
that? 
Are 

men overreacting and missing 

the valid criticism of their 

behavioral 
constructs? 
Or 

are 
political 
identitarians 

unfairly indicting an entire 

gender for the behavior of 

a subset of bad actors? And 

what is “masculinity” anyway? 

How much of it is innate and 

biological and how much is 

inculcated from society? This 

controversy sparked a dialogue, 

and with it came an opportunity 

for others to define the issue.

Two days later, the company 

Egard 
Watches 
uploaded 

the ad, “What is a man? A 

response 
to 
Gillette.” 
The 

advertisement emphasized the 

good in men, showing vignettes 

of firefighters, soldiers and 

civilian heroes paired with 

statistics demonstrating that 

men account for 93 percent of 

workplace fatalities, over 97 

percent of war fatalities, 71 

percent of all homicide victims, 

80 percent of all suicide victims 

and 75 percent of all homeless 

people (though numbers taken 

from 
SAMHSA 
suggest 
51 

percent of all homeless people 

are single men, 24 percent are 

single women, and 23 percent 

are 
families, 
usually 
single 

mothers with children). The 

video was dedicated to “all 

those who sacrifice everything 

to make the world safer and 

better 
for 
all 
of 
us,” 
and 

projected a positive message 

about the nature of traditional 

masculinity.

The 
founder 
of 
Egard 

Watches, Ilan Srulovicz, said 

Gillette’s ad unfairly painted 

men with a broad brush: “It’s the 

overwhelming majority of men 

who sacrifice, who want to be 

protectors, who want to be good. 

And how do you effect positive 

change? … You show the best of 

us.” Is masculinity an archaic 

set of tools that have become 

outdated and problematic for 

our modern world, or is it a 

strength men can use to make 

the world better? While Gillette 

highlights 
toxic 
masculinity, 

Egard 
highlights 
virtuous 

masculinity, and judging from 

YouTube’s 
responses, 
the 

majority of viewers decidedly 

favor Egard’s message.

So perhaps Egard’s critique 

reflects the issue here: Gillette’s 

delivery. While many agreed 

with 
the 
message 
Gillette 

espoused, the majority don’t 

believe it is the place of an 

often 
morally 
challenged 

multinational 
corporation 
to 

feed them their ethical peas 

and carrots. “Just the type of 

social commentary I look for 

in my shaving gel,” said one 

commenter, 
garnering 
over 

11,000 likes. A similar sentiment 

was seen in the backlash to Nike’s 

Colin 
Kaepernick 
campaign. 

Furthermore, many commented 

that Gillette’s representations of 

men were extreme, unrealistic 

and outlandish, and perhaps a 

popular video with cartoonish 

vignettes 
is 
not 
the 
most 

sensitive instrument to deal 

with an important issue like 

this.

One vignette in the Gillette 

ad shows two boys beating 

each other at a barbecue to 

an 
audience 
of 
complacent 

men when Gillette’s ideal man 

swoops in to break them up. 

“That’s not how we treat each 

other, 
okay?” 
he 
instructs 

with 
a 
paternal 
kindness. 

Gillette’s implication here is 

the unenlightened men would 

merely stand by and watch these 

little boys tear violently at each 

other. Here, Gillette’s vision was 

fair, but its portrayal of men 

missed the mark.

Gillette believes some part 

of traditional masculinity is 

flawed. This toxic masculinity — 

the violent, overly competitive, 

unemotional 
or 
sexually 

aggressive behavior in men — 

is a product of our historical 

attitudes 
towards 
men 
and 

women. Certainly, it is true that 

some male behavior considered 

“masculine” 
is 
undesirable. 

Unfortunately, however, Gillette 

missed a great opportunity to 

better analyze this with morally 

reasonable 
and 
instructive 

scenes.

A 
viewer 
must 

recognize that both of these 

advertisements 
are 
merely 

business campaigns designed 

to appeal to consumers in a 

divided political atmosphere 

and rake in market share and 

sales for their shaving razors 

and wristwatches. There’s no 

such thing as bad publicity 

after all, and just as Nike’s sales 

increased 31 percent after their 

Colin Kaepernick controversy, 

Gillette’s trending status may 

follow suit. Yet both of these 

videos do offer us fascinating 

insights into a modern dialogue 

of what it means to be a man. In 

the end, perhaps we should be 

careful about how we paint half 

the population of the planet, 

and ensure our well-intended 

messages inspire rather than 

alienate.

Gillette’s vision

portrayal of men 
missed the mark


While I wrote about “Slender Man” last year, I mentioned 
that trying to analyze a movie so completely devoid of quality 
was similar to going into a dissociative 
state. All of what I thought I knew about 
movies suddenly meant nothing, because 
nothing 
meant 
anything. 
Sure, 
shoot 
every single scene of the movie without a 
light on. Completely abandon characters 
and plotlines. Kill Joey King with a tree. 
What the hell does it matter? I thought 
that would be my greatest challenge as a 
reviewer: putting into words that “Slender 
Man” wasn’t just a bad movie, it was a 
nothing movie. Enter “Replicas.”
Keanu Reeves (“John Wick”) stars as 
William Foster, a brilliant scientist who 
is this close — this close — to a world-
changing breakthrough in transferring 
human consciousness from a biological 
subject to a synthetic one if his family and 
his boss would just get out of his way with 
their “ethical questions” and their “board 
meetings.” Luckily for him, his family is 
quickly killed in a car crash, providing him 
with not only a relief from those moralistic 
voices of reason but with new test subjects. 
Retreating to his home, he clones his 
family and begins the work that will see 
their consciousness transferred from their 
old bodies to their new ones. What could possibly go wrong?
Everything.
Everything could possibly go wrong.
In order to get at the heart of the journey “Replicas” takes 
you on, you almost have to break it up into chunks. Trying to 
digest the whole thing at once can only lead to pain. First, let’s 
go back to before the beginning. The film was shot in mid-2016 

— produced by the not-at-all-fake-sounding Company Films 
— and screened at the Toronto International Film Festival in 
September of 2017, where it was sold to the very-real-why-do-
you-ask Entertainment Studios Motion 
Pictures. The first trailer dropped Oct. 
of that same year, promising the sort of 
movie that you’ll 
find on Reeves’s 
IMDb ten years 
from 
now 
and 
say out loud, “He 
was in that?” In 
lieu of a release 
date, the trailer 
just 
promised 
“Replicas” 
was 
“coming soon.”
A 
year 
and 
a 
half 
passed. 
To 
put 
it 
in 
perspective, 
Barack 
Obama 
was 
still 
president 
when 
“Replicas” 
was 
shot, 
and 
candidacies 
for 
the 2020 election 
were 
being 
announced when 
it was released. 
It took a while. 
Curiously, 
“Replicas” 
didn’t 
undergo 
any 
reshoots that would necessitate such a 
long wait, and by all appearances, it’s 
the same movie that was screened at TIFF 2017. Expectations 
weren’t low for “Replicas,” because by the time it found its 
way to theaters, everyone had basically forgotten it existed. 
Another trailer dropped, and again as befitting a Keanu 
Reeves 
movie 
that 
doesn’t 
begin with the words “John 
Wick,” 
everyone 
basically 
shrugged.
Now we can get to the movie. 
That lack of expectations may 
have played a role in my initial 
reaction to the film, or at least 
its first act, which takes the 
form of a trashy Frankenstein 
homage that, while not exactly 
high 
art, 
is 
entertaining 
nonetheless for its willingness 
to commit to tropes usually 
found in horror movies. It 
plays like a SyFy original 
movie, but you know what? 
There’s nothing wrong with a 
little dumb fun every once in a 
while.
Then 
everything 
starts 
changing. Plotlines drop like 
flies; in the most egregious 
example, the bodies of Reeves’s 
deceased 
family 
members 
simply 
disappear 
between 
scenes. 
Director 
Jeffrey 
Nachmanoff (“Traitor”) starts 
listening to his worst instincts, 

resulting in silly directing choice after silly directing choice, 
like cheesy zooms before obvious trailer lines that resulted in 
my first unintentional laughs of the movie.
They would not be the last.
From here, it’s hard to discuss 
what happens without delving into 
spoilers, and given that I think 
“Replicas” is a film that has to be 
seen to be believed — and by that 
same token, should be seen with a 
couple of friends and more than a 
couple of beers — I wouldn’t want to 
rob you of the impact of seeing some 
of this for the first time. So in the 
most general of terms, the horror 
stylings give way to the cliché sci-
fi thriller you’d expect from a movie 
with the tagline “Some humans are 
unstoppable.” It’s bad, but more 
than that, it’s simply boring.
Then everything changes again. 
Where the first shift was a slow 
decline from trashy B-movie to the 
sort of snooze-fest Januaries are 
made of, it’s possible to pinpoint 
the exact moment that “Replicas” 
seals its fate as one of the most 
memorably bad movies in recent 
memory. From this moment on, there 
are more shots at canted angles than 
there are normal shots, as if the 
cinematographer passed out halfway 
through production and was clinging 
to the camera for support. There are 
multiple conspiracies, multiple heel 
turns and multiple laugh-worthy 
moments — all before the killer robot shows up, because of 
course there’s a killer robot. I’d say the effects used to bring 
it to life look like something out of a video game, but frankly, 
I’ve been playing a lot of “Red Dead Redemption 2” lately 
and I think my go-to pan for bad effects would be insulting 
to video games if applied here. It looks like the effects artist 
took their kids’ box of crayons and just drew a robot on the 
screen. By this point, “Replicas” barely resembles a real movie 
as much as it does a movie pitched by a fictional character in 
a scene meant to satirize everything wrong with Hollywood. 
If Keanu Reeves ever starred in a sequel to “Tropic Thunder,” 
this is the fake trailer they’d show before the movie.
I don’t know what to say about “Replicas” besides what I 
already have. You have to see it to believe it. There’s no way 
to properly quantify it. Even describing in exact detail what 
happens on screen wouldn’t do it justice because there’s 
no way to capture how quickly it moves between different 
sorts of bad — from affable trash to boring trash to a sort of 
transcendent trash that forced me to reconsider how I think 
about movies. If a movie has some highs, does that rectify 
the fact that it also has some of the most abysmal lows I’ve 
ever encountered? Or does its slow descent into madness taint 
everything that came before it? Was I wrong to think there 
was any good in it to begin with or was everything I thought 
was remotely remarkable just the result of me believing these 
things would pay off later or that the writer knew what a pay 
off was? Are there any lessons to be learned here or is the 
whole thing just a trial sent by God to test the faith of film 
fans?
I don’t know. I just don’t know. I feel like Luke Skywalker 
trying to decide if Darth Vader can still be redeemed even 
though he blew up a planet. “Replicas” is good. “Replicas” is 
bad. “Replicas” is all.

Ann Arbor’s music scene is 
one of tradition and variance. 
Specifically, the venues in Ann 
Arbor play a crucial role in the 
city’s musical history. Hill 
Auditorium, in conjunction 
with the University Musical 
Society, is known for hosting 
some of the most legendary 
orchestras 
of 
all 
time 
— 
the New York and Berlin 
Philharmonics, to name a few. 
The Blind Pig brings in a wide 
variety of punk, popular and 
local musicians to a historic 
venue that big names of the 
past have walked through. 
But one of the most intimate 
venues that Ann Arbor owes a 
significant part of its history 
to over the last 50 years is The 
Ark. The Ark plays an integral 
role in bringing folk music to 
Ann Arbor, hosting over 300 
different acts of varying styles 
throughout the year, from 
folk to jazz to bluegrass and 
everything in between.
Founded 
in 
1965, 
The 
Ark began as a nonprofit 
organization, 
and 
has 
remained 
the 
same 
since, 
aside from a brief stint in the 
’70s. Times had become tough, 
and the venue had to rely on 
ticket sales to keep afloat. The 
Ark was able to get back on 
track, able to return to their 
mission with the initiation of an 
idea in 1977. That idea was The 
Ann Arbor Folk Festival.
“Those first couple of Folk 
Festivals sort of came out of 
desperate measures and these 
artists coming together saying, 

‘we’ll do this show and support 
this 
venue 
that’s 
important 
to us as performers as well as 
the community’,” Barb Chaffer 
Authier, the marketing director at 
The Ark, said in an interview with 
The Daily. Since then, the festival 
has remained an important aspect 

of The Ark’s legacy.
A few things have changed since 
1977, when the festival was held 
on only one night in the Power 
Center. It wasn’t until the mid-
’80s when the festival switched 
over to Hill Auditorium, bringing 

in headliner Bonnie Raitt. Back 
then, headliners consisted of local 
artists, as opposed to the huge 
names that are brought into town 
today.
In 2003, the festival added a 
second night. “Hill Auditorium 
went 
under 
renovation 
in 
2003, which is the year we 
moved back to the Michigan 
Theater,” Authier explained. 
“And because we now had 
a crowd of over 3000 that 
were attending the festival 
… that’s when we started 
doing two nights.” When the 
festival moved back to Hill 
Auditorium, The Ark decided 
to keep the festival two days 
long due to the success of the 
previous year.
Having 
more 
time 
for 
different acts, the festival 
decided to push the boundaries 
with some of the artists they 
brought in. “You hear Folk 
Festival and you might be 
thinking ‘Kumbaya’ or singer-
songwriter 
or 
something 
like that, but it really gave 
us the opportunity to put a 
bigger variety of music on the 
lineup,” Authier explained.
The 
Ann 
Arbor 
Folk 
Festival has not only allowed 
The Ark to remain nonprofit 
by becoming one of its biggest 
fundraisers, but it has also 
made Ann Arbor one of the 
most well-known spots in the 
country for folk music. The 
Ann Arbor Folk Festival takes 
place this Friday and Saturday, 
Jan. 25 and 26, at Hill Auditorium. 
In addition to the festival, many 
of the artists on the lineup will be 
returning to The Ark this winter 
and spring. Tickets for those 
shows are on sale now.

Folk Fest to be fully fantastic

Like the entirety of 
Vice News, “Temptation 
Island” 
nags 
at 
my 
inability to resist trivial 
media. A reboot of the 
2001 hit, the show centers 
on four couples who are 
questioning 
their 
relationships 
and 
places 
them on an 
island 
with 
a handful of 
hot 
singles 
whose 
sole 
purpose 
is 
to 
get 
the 
couples 
to 
cheat on each 
other.
If 
“Temptation 
Island” 
sounds 
like 
it 
was 
genetically 
modified 
in 
a lab to be as scandalous 
as 
possible, 
that’s 
because 
it 
definitely 
was. One moment I’m 
getting “Jersey Shore”-
style 
bickering, 
the 
next 
moment 
I 
have 
tension inspired by “The 
Bachelor” — all of this is 
only made better by the 
host Mark L. Walberg. 
This 
man 
makes 
me 
think he would’ve hosted 
“Survivor” 
if 
only 
he 
didn’t get too “in his 
feels.” The show might as 
well include a disclaimer 

warning the audience that 
the show is best viewed 
while scrolling through 
your Instagram feed in 
one hand and typing a 
half-finished essay in the 
other.
Despite the low barrier 
of 
entry, 
“Temptation 
Island” isn’t a bad show. 
In fact, I was sufficiently 

entertained 
while 
watching it. The vicarious 
nature of watching other 
couples potentially cheat 
on another gave me a 
giddy, omniscient feeling. 
Watching 
“Temptation 
Island” is akin to being 
the cool kid that everyone 
tells their secrets to, yet 
not being expected to 
give any dirt in return. 
This 
sometimes 
blurs 
the line between genuine 
and 
scripted 
reactions 
but if you actually stop to 
think about it you realize 

it doesn’t matter because 
it’s “Temptation Island,” 
and who cares.
Though 
“Temptation 
Island” exists solely to 
fulfill our need for gossip, 
comparing 
the 
2000’s 
version to this current 
rendition, an interesting 
conversation about how 
reality 
television 
has 
changed 
before 
our 
eyes 
is 
provoked. 
Today, it is 
expected 
that 
everyone 
who appears 
on 
reality 
television 
will 
be 
palatable 
enough 
to 
be 
deemed 
attractive by 
the 
average 
viewer.
However, 
if 
you 
compare the 
singles who appeared on 
the 2000’s version and the 
singles in the reboot, you 
can see plainly the drastic 
shift in our expectations 
for who can be on a show 
that is supposed to be 
present reality. It’s almost 
as entertaining as the 
show itself to watch USA 
Network dictate what the 
“ideal American” bachelor 
and bachelorette looks, 
dresses and acts like. And 
if that means cheating on 
your significant other, so 
be it.

The 
title 
of 
Kristen 
Roupenian’s 
first 
short 
story 
collection, 
“You 
Know You Want This,” is as 
absorbing and inviting as it 
is 
provocative 
and 
rancorous. 
It’s 
the 
voice of someone that 
knows the power they 
wield, a person who is 
not afraid to use it to 
manipulate. This bold 
acknowledgement of 
one’s sexual prowess 
is something you’d 
expect to see in a 
raunchy 
message, 
maybe, or on a film 
screen. Anywhere but 
the cover of the fresh 
literary 
sensation’s 
first book.
If 
the 
daring 
extorted by the cover 
is 
an 
indicator 
of 
anything, it’s of the 
fierceness to follow. 
“You Know You Want 
This” is a compilation 
of 
twelve 
short 
stories, 
with 
“Cat 
Person,” Roupenian’s 
viral 
2017 
piece, 
smack in the middle. 
But if readers crack 
the 
Helen 
Zell 
Writers’ 
Program 
graduate’s 
newest 
publication 
expecting 
another stoic, extra-literary 
story of the world like that 
of “Cat Person,” they are 
expecting wrong.
To 
a 
grandiose 
effect, 
Roupenian decides to open 
the work with something 
brash: the sexual psychosis 
and abuse of “Bad Boy.” 
Roupenian refuses to hesitate 
in introducing her breadth 
as a writer, boldly declaring 
herself on the page in a take-
it-or-leave-it cleanse. This is 
commendable. “Bad Boy” — 
if readers survive its horror 
— is a fantastic story. No 
matter how despicable the 
scenario, Roupenian leaves 
questions unanswered and 
tempts the reader onward, a 
choice that few will be able 
to turn down.
Following the initiation 
“Bad 
Boy” 
provides, 
the 
collection wanders off mostly 

into story hybrids of horror 
and literary fiction. Most of 
the stories are successful, 
with 
only 
a 
few 
failing 
to reach splendor. Three 
consecutive 
stories 
near 
the center of the work seem 
to fumble, like “Sardines,” 
a story which lacks the 

inflexible and surefire plots 
of the rest of the collection. 
It reads as misplaced and 
incohesive with the tone of 
the remaining work. While 
the writing of such stories 
maintains 
their 
quality, 
the structure falls flat. The 
endings jump away from the 
central plot they maintained 
for their first half, almost as 
though Roupenian ran out of 
ideas and scribbled in some 
gasp-worthy ending so that 
the middle stories matched 
the rest of the collection.
But 
between 
“Cat 
Person” and the eight other 
sensations in “You Know You 
Want This,” the collection is 
easily forgivable for these 
lapses. “Cat Person” in itself 
is so wonderfully true to 
life, so fearlessly blunt and 
unforgiving, that it nearly 
absolves the collection all 
by itself. Works such as 

“The Good Guy,” “Death 
Wish” and “Biter,” jaggedly 
stand out, too. In the former, 
Roupenian returns to the 
fable of social media dating, 
only this time making it the 
female 
counterpart 
who 
knows so badly what they 
want — to be harmed a great 
deal 
prior 
to 
sex. 
This story highlights 
what Roupenian does 
best: She flashlights 
over 
the 
murkiest 
possibilities 
of 
humanity, 
baring 
the 
vile 
and 
uncomfortable. This 
has more effect than 
mere 
discomfort 
and intrigue. It is 
through such reveals 
that 
Roupenian 
is 
able 
to 
pinpoint 
exactitudes 
of 
the 
world that innocuous 
fiction 
cannot 
achieve. She offers a 
character that elicits 
recoil 
in 
readers, 
only to seduce them 
into wandering back 
into narratives with 
her grimness.
Marked 
by 
the 
accomplishment 
of 
polished writing, this 
intrepidness attains 
exceptionality. 
Impossible 
to 
be 
bored 
with, 
the 
stories pry at the 
very edges of what fiction 
endangers to do. “You Know 
You Want This” navigates 
the desire to hurt and be 
hurt, 
the 
realm 
of 
lust, 
infatuation, harassment and, 
yes, the politics of being a 
mother of a pre-teen. And it 
is remarkable.
Any 
readers 
expecting 
regurgitations 
of 
“Cat 
Person” (or any New Yorker 
story for that matter) are 
sure to be surprised in the 
best of ways by the brilliance 
and brashness Roupenian is 
able to accomplish. “You 
Know You Want This,” steers 
through venereal, disturbing 
and absurdist worlds, daring 
readers to keep their eyes 
open. 
Roupenian 
settles 
into her place as principal 
antagonist by way of her 
narratives, as if challenging 
readers at every turn: If you 
can stomach it, look.

BOOK REVIEW
Roupenian is ravishing

JOHN DECKER
Daily Arts Writer

With Martin Luther King Jr. Day 
and dreams for an equal society in 
mind, the arrival of “If Beale Street 
Could Talk” to the big screen is 
undeniably timely. After awing 
audiences with the dazzling and 
poignant 
“Moonlight,” 
director 
Barry Jenkins proves once more 
that his talents know no bounds. 
Jenkins’ latest piece, “If Beale 
Street Could Talk,” juxtaposes 
flickers of the beauty, innocence 
and warmth of young love with 
the rotten and bitter reality of 
racial injustice in the 1970s. 
With breathtaking visuals and a 
memorable score, Jenkins revives 
James Baldwin’s beloved love 
story, honoring the late novelist 
and shedding light on the societal 
inequality that our nation has yet 
to overcome still today.
Alonzo “Fonny” (Stephan James, 
“Race”) and Tish (KiKi Layne, 
“Veracity”) have always belonged 
to each other. Neighbors in Harlem 
since childhood, the nature of their 
relationship evolved as they grew, 
but the love between them was 
always unquestioned, true and pure. 
Fonny and Tish’s future marriage 
plans are tested when their worlds 
are turned upside-down with news 

of both Fonny’s wrongful conviction 
of rape and Tish’s unplanned 
pregnancy. Led by Tish’s mother 
Sharon (Regina King “Ray”), Tish 
and Fonny’s families crusade to 
prove 
Fonny’s 
innocence 
and 
prepare for Tish’s baby, struggling 
against a system constructed to deny 
them justice.
Hands down, one of the most 
impressive aspects of the film is the 

brilliant cinematography. Jenkins 
stays true to the same style he 
established in “Moonlight,” filling 
the screen with rich colors and 
expertly 
interspersing 
close-up 
shots. The honey-golds, yellows, 
deep reds and warm brown tones 
that dominate the film’s color 
palate, paired with the incredibly 
personalized camera movement 
invite the viewer inside the emotional 

worlds of the characters. In one 
especially impactful sequence, we 
watch a flashback of artistically-
minded Fonny crafting an unshaped 
sculpture out of wood. The camera 
pans around Fonny as he inspects 
his work, the smoke from a cigarette 
between his lips gracefully twirling 
into the air. The smoke moves 
about in the air as Fonny paces the 
floor, creating the stunning image 
of a dance between the smoke 
and Fonny in sync with the 
accompanying melodic score.
Also to Jenkin’s credit is his 
clever interplay of auditory and 
visual components. “If Beale 
Street Could Talk” balances the 
heavy and dark with the light 
and beautiful, simultaneously 
translating Baldwin’s words about 
the wonders of first love and the 
racist outside world’s threat to it 
to screen. The score reflects these 
contrasting themes, somehow 
managing to sound both deeply 
heartbreaking and hopeful. Though 
at times the steady-nature of the 
film can make some moments drag 
a bit long, it is not so much that the 
quality of Jenkin’s creation can be 
waved aside. All blended together, 
the strong use of color, emotional 
tangibility of the actors and well-
crafted score create a powerful 
effect that can only be described as 
symphonic.

I 
cannot 
fathom 
the 
number of bruises the 21 
bodies comprising the Los 
Angeles 
Master 
Chorale 
will have as they continue 
to 
trudge 
through 
their 
world tour performance of 
“Lagrime di San Pietro.”
“Lagrime di San Pietro,” 
meaning “Tears of St. Peter,” 
is an Italian Renaissance 
choral piece composed by 
Franco-Flemish 
composer 
Orlando di Lasso in 1594. 
The piece depicts the seven 
stages of grief experienced by 
St. Peter after he renounced 
his affiliation with Jesus 
Christ before his arrest and 
subsequent crucifixion. Upon 
Jesus’s arrest, many of his 
disciples and followers fled 
or were punished alongside 
him. St. Peter is a subject of 
particular focus upon the 
arrest of Jesus because of 
his denial of Christ. St. Peter 
can be seen as a figure of 
betrayal — both betrayal of a 
friend and betrayal of faith — 
and as such, Peter spent the 
rest of his life full of regret 
for his disloyalty. Peter is 
effectively stuck pondering 
on his sin, while the rest of 
the world marches on. As 
described by Doyle Amburst, 
violist 
for 
the 
Spektral 
Quartet, “The tragedy in this 
story is not the accident. It is 
the catastrophe of being left 
behind.”
“Lagrime” is an ancient 
piece, one that has been 
performed countless times 

for 
countless 
audiences 
because 
of 
its 
beautiful 
harmonies 
and 
emotional 
storyline. The Los Angeles 
Master Chorale, guided by 
Conductor 
Grant 
Gershon 
and Director Peter Sellars, 
embraces a novel element to 
“Lagrime”: kinesiology.
The Master Chorale enter 
the 
stage 
lacking 
shoes 
and garbed in loose gray 
clothing, depicting the drab 
mental state of Peter. And 
though this outfit is not 
entirely far off from the 
dress of the era, the clothes, 
more importantly, allow the 
singers to move about the 
stage freely. This introduces 
a new, kinetic art form to the 
traditionally choral piece, 
and the group uses it well.
Throughout 
the 
piece, 
dramatic 
movements 
are 
scored 
by 
strong 
Italian 
lyrics that may correspond 
with or contradict what is 
being sung. As Peter was 
being metaphorically shot 
with 
arrows, 
the 
singers 
toppled to the floor in pain 
while 
maintaining 
proper 
intonation. After a moment 
of silence at the end of a 
piece, 
the 
singers 
slowly 
maneuvered to their feet, 
mimicking 
the 
malaise 
mornings of Peter’s as he was 
reminded of his regret.
Some 
of 
the 
group’s 
movements, especially those 
that are not easy on the body, 
were heavily repeated — I 
cannot count the number 
of times the singers fell to 
their knees, laid on the stage, 
jumped up quickly, clutched 
their 
chest 
or 
clutched 

their 
fellow 
performers. 
Upon reflection, however, 
the repetitive oscillation of 
visible activity and lethargy 
elegantly mirrored the cycle 
of depression felt by Peter. 
This ability to be actively 
moving and not miss a musical 
beat is a feat in and of itself. 
To also incorporate meaning 
into those movements shows 
true mastery of the piece.
In 
addition 
to 
bodily 
representations of the music, 
lighting became a key part 
of the performance. As the 
singers described the cold felt 
by Peter, the lights became 
a diffuse to a dim white. 
Upon the revival of spring, 
the lights became warmer, 
as the snow melted. Not 
only did the lights brighten, 
but the singers moved more 
gracefully 
and 
the 
notes 
being 
sung 
were 
softer 
and warmer. In effect, the 
lighting created even more 
feeling and emotion. Changes 
in lighting can easily become 
distracting 
and 
conflict 
with the piece. However, 
the lighting techniques used 
in “Lagrime” were expertly 
carried out.
The 
performance 
runs 
approximately 80 minutes 
with no intermission. The 
audience must sit through 
the whole grieving process 
of 
St. 
Peter: 
the 
anger, 
the 
depression 
and 
the 
contemplations of suicide. 
There is no break from the 
grief, no opportunity to slip 
away. But to be encapsulated 
by this performance for 80 
minutes was not something 
difficult to do.

Michigan looks to break out of offensive funk at Indiana

On Tuesday night, Michigan 
hit 21 of 62 shots, including a 
feeble 3-for-22 from 3-point 
range, and scored just 0.92 
points per possession.
Thanks 
to 
a 
buzzer-
beater 
by 
redshirt 
junior 
wing Charles Matthews, the 
Wolverines escaped with a 
59-57 win over Minnesota. But 
that highlight aside, anyone 
who bravely trekked through 
the freezing rain to Crisler 
Center would call it for what it 
was: an objectively ugly game 
of basketball.
How 
ugly? 
Michigan’s 
effective field goal percentage 
of 36.3 was, per UMHoops.
com, 
its 
worst 
shooting 
performance in a win since 
2008, when John Beilein’s first 
Wolverine team beat Illinois, 
49-43.
It’s 
a 
frequent 
saying, 
especially in a conference 
as strong as the Big Ten — 
a win is a win. That didn’t 
offset the ugliness or make 
this particular win any more 
enjoyable.
Speaking 
to 
reporters 
20 minutes after the most 
memorable play of his college 
career, Matthews was subdued. 
He candidly elaborated on 
Michigan’s 
latest 
struggles 
while seemingly trying to 
forget about the Wolverines’ 
last two games.
“Yeah, 
I’m 
happy,” 
Matthews said. “But I don’t 
feel like we played that well.”
He continued: “I told the 
team, (junior guard Zavier 
Simpson) told us as well, we 
kinda gotta loosen up. We’re 
playing kinda tense out there. 
We understand we want to 
have a perfect season. We 
want to win, but we still gotta 
be out there playing with 
smiles on our faces, having fun 
and competing to win.”
In 
the 
overall 
season 
context, 
Matthews’ 

explanation 
for 
Michigan’s 
sluggishness makes at least 
some sense, because it’s a story 
we’ve seen before.
The 
Wolverines 
trudged 
through December’s slate of 
guarantee games and looked 
similarly uninspired against 
Big 
Ten 
bottom-dweller 
Penn State. After beating the 
Nittany Lions, a date with 
then-No. 21 Indiana loomed. 
Despite an unbeaten record, 
the past month had set a 
mandate: 
Michigan 
would 
have to play more inspired, 
play more consistent, play 
better against better teams.
And did the Wolverines 
ever do that. Matthews was 
everywhere 
against 
the 
Hoosiers, racking up steals 
and fast-break dunks while 
locking future lottery pick 
Romeo Langford in a closet. 
Highly-touted 
freshman 
Brandon Johns broke out to 
the tune of eight points and 
eight boards in 13 minutes. 
Michigan led by 17 points 
less than 10 minutes in and 
finished with a 74-63 win that 
never seemed that close. To 
the extent that “flipping the 
switch” is a real phenomenon, 
this was it.
That contest was in line 
with a trend: The Wolverines 
have 
played 
their 
best 
basketball with the bright 
lights on. In highly anticipated 
games 
against 
Villanova, 
North Carolina, Purdue and 
Indiana, they were just about 
untouchable, and they seemed 
to know it. But they haven’t 
always looked that way against 
teams that shouldn’t be able to 
touch them.
Maybe Matthews is correct. 
Maybe 
Michigan 
possesses 
the ability to flip the switch 
whenever it wants. Maybe all 
it needs is to have fun again.
All of this is to say: Friday 
night’s rematch at Indiana will 
put that theory’s viability to 
the test.
It’s a matchup that has 

admittedly lost a bit of its 
luster. Starting with their loss 
in Ann Arbor, the Hoosiers are 
in a five-game tailspin. They 
come in shorthanded as well 
— center De’Ron Davis is out 
with an ankle injury, while 
starting guard Devonte Green 
was indefinitely suspended 
earlier 
in 
the 
week 
for 
undisclosed reasons.
But it is a road game in 
the Big Ten, and as cliché as 
it is, winning on the road in 
conference play is a challenge 
itself. If there’s any place 
that provides a real home-
court advantage, it’s Indiana’s 
Assembly 
Hall. 
And 
the 
Hoosiers still have Langford 
and forward Juwan Morgan — 
who scored 25 points against 
the Wolverines on Jan. 6.
Simply put? It’s a game that 
Michigan shouldn’t have to 

struggle to get up for.
“When you’ve got 17,000 
people cheering against you, 
it’s just the stuff you dream 
about 
growing 
up,” 
said 
sophomore 
guard 
Jordan 
Poole. 
“You 
want to be in 
situations 
like 
this.”
Beilein spoke 
more 
quietly 
than 
usual 
Tuesday, flatly 
stating 
his 
disappointment 
in 
Michigan’s 
lack of growth 
from Saturday’s 
loss. Thursday, 
his tone was similar but 
tempered. He admitted that 
his expectations might have 
been too high; that his message 
after the loss to Wisconsin 

needed more time to sink in.
“I was not as happy as I 
probably should have been,” he 
said. “I think, as a coach, you 
expect too much, you expect 
it to immediately kick in after 
the 
Wisconsin 
game. And when 
I 
saw 
some 
of the similar 
things that we 
had pointed out 
… 
Sometimes 
you just gotta be 
ready to move 
on, realize I’m 
human, they’re 
human, and we 
should 
have 
enjoyed 
that 
win better.”
But if the lessons learned 
in Madison have yet to take 
effect, 
any 
concerns 
will 
keep 
growing 
in 
urgency. 

On the heels of two subpar 
performances, the difference 
between a two-point win, a 
20-point win or a loss becomes 
that much greater.
If the Wolverines indeed 
have a switch, Friday night 
would be a good time for them 
to flip it.
“I feel like we were just 
trying to go out there and 
win a game, rather than being 
excited to make open shots 
and being excited to beat a 
good team. I feel like that’s 
something that decreased the 
last couple games,” Poole said. 
“Being able to flip the switch 
and try to turn it on tomorrow 
and get after it in practice, 
just have fun. When you’re 
there, you have 16 people 
against 17,000. … Being in that 
situation is something I feel is 
exciting for us.”

Wolverines drop contest to Indiana, 70-60, pushing road record to 2-7

In the midst of a back-
and-forth sequence, Indiana 
regained control.
First, having found space 
on 
the 
wing, 
Hoosier guard 
Jaelynn 
Penn 
knocked down 
a 
3-pointer. 
Moments later, 
following 
a 
turnover 
by 
Michigan’s 
freshman point 
guard 
Amy 
Dilk, 
it 
was 
Ali 
Patberg 
converting a baseline floater 
on the other end for Indiana.
That 30-second sequence 
seemed to encapsulate the 
game as a whole. Despite 
making 
multiple 
runs 
to 
keep the game close, the 
Wolverines 
(12-8 
overall, 
3-5 Big Ten) just never took 
command, ultimately losing 
to the Hoosiers (16-4, 5-3) on 
the road, 70-60.
From the start, Indiana 

dictated the tempo of the 
contest. It jumped out to a 
five-point lead and built on 
it as the quarter progressed. 
Three-pointers from Penn 
and Brenna Wise pushed its 
lead to eight with 3:30 left 
in 
the 
first 
quarter.
To 
Michigan’s 
credit, it fought 
its 
way 
back 
thanks in large 
part to the play 
of 
sophomore 
forward 
Hailey Brown. 
Down 
just 
six 
entering 
the second quarter, Brown 
scored five quick points — 
including a three from the 
top of the key.
From 
that 
point 
on, 
the game was played at 
lightning 
speed. 
Penn’s 
second 
3-pointer 
of 
the 
game was matched by senior 
guard Nicole Munger. The 
Wolverines’ sharpshooter — 
who was 1-16 from beyond the 
arc in Big Ten away games 

entering Thursday — found 
her target again later in the 
quarter to pull Michigan 
within two. Following the 
Hoosiers’ 
quick 
five-point 
burst, 
freshman 
forward 
Naz 
Hillmon 
converted 
two contested layups — 
foreshadowing 
things 
to 
come — to cut Indiana’s lead 
to just three at the half.
The 
Hoosiers 
however, 
came out of the break firing 
on all cylinders. Off of a 
defensive 
rebound, 
Penn 
raced down the floor and 
finished at the rim. Another 
jumper from Patberg and 
an open 3-pointer from the 
corner gave Indiana even 
more breathing room.
In 
customary 
fashion 
though, 
the 
Wolverines 
closed 
the 
gap. 
From 
a 
double-team, senior center 
Hallie 
Thome 
skillfully 
found Dilk, crashing toward 
the basket for an easy layup. 
Hillmon, then, went to work 
in the paint — gathering 
an offensive rebound and 
finishing 
down-low 
on 
multiple occasions.

And 
yet, 
every 
time 
Michigan seemed to regain 
its 
footing, 
the 
Hoosiers 
answered 
accordingly. 
During 
one 
exchange 
at 
the beginning of the fourth 
quarter, 
Dilk 
received a pass 
in 
transition 
and had a clear 
path 
toward 
the 
rim. 
Out 
of 
nowhere 
Indiana’s 
Bendu 
Yeaney 
sprinted down 
the floor and 
stripped 
the 
ball 
out 
of 
Dilk’s unsuspecting hands.
“Kinda seemed like they 

were first to the loose-balls 
all night,” said Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico. 
“Even when we got a steal 
early on, we gave it right 
back to them. The ball was 
going through 
our hands early 
on.”
The 
dagger 
came 
with 
a 
minute 
left 
in the fourth 
quarter. 
Since 
Thome 
was 
dominating 
inside 
defensively 
— 
finishing 
with 
five 
blocks 
— 
the 
Hoosiers had to hit from the 

outside. Penn did exactly 
that — finding space on the 
right wing and drilling the 
20-footer to bring her final 
point total to 28.
The 
Wolverines 
fought 
valiantly, but their scoreless 
final 
three 
minutes 
and 
Indiana’s ability to make 
plays when they had to, in the 
end, resulted in another away 
defeat, pushing their road 
record to 2-7.
“We got really good looks,” 
Barnes Arico said. “That’s the 
thing — we ran stuff in our 
offense, we got looks in our 
offense and they just didn’t 
go in. And they made ten 
threes, so they shot the ball 
incredibly well all night.”

Michigan dominates Penn State, 5-1

The 
first 
two 
matchups 
between the Michigan hockey 
team and No. 15 Penn State 
resulted in a total of 23 goals 
scored.
In turn, Michigan coach Mel 
Pearson shifted his focus to 
defense — something he had 
emphasized all season. But for 
Thursday’s matchup especially, 
he made clear that he wanted 
to see the team protect the net 
better.
And 
after 
a 
scoreless 
first period, the game plan 
showed. From start to finish, 
the Wolverines made junior 
goaltender 
Hayden 
Lavigne’s 
night easier throughout the 
period — and the game, one that 
ended in a 5-1 win for Michigan. 
Though the Nittany Lions had 
32 shot attempts and 15 on target 
in the first period alone, few of 
them were high-quality looks.
Michigan blocked nine shots 
and held Penn State’s only power 
play of the period to zero shots. 
It wasn’t until the dying minutes 
of the period that Penn State 
had a clean look on net, which 
was stopped by Lavigne after a 
barrage of shots.
Offensively, the Wolverines 
were held to a low-shot count — 
seven.
“I thought our first period was 
a little slow,” said junior forward 
Jake Slaker. “After a week off, 
it’s tough. I thought they were 
a little more ready for the start 
of the game, just looking at the 
shots, they had 15, we had seven. 
Then the rest of the game, we 
took over.”
The 
second 
period 
saw 
the 
Wolverines’ 
offensive 
aggression pay off. Sophomore 
Dakota Raabe made a sprint 
to the offensive zone. The 
majority of both teams were 
still in Michigan’s defensive 
zone, but freshman forward 
Jimmy 
Lambert 
saw 
Raabe 
in the neutral zone and shot a 
push forward. The pass landed 

perfectly at Raabe’s stick as he 
staked into the zone, with only 
one defender trailing him.
The one-on-one confrontation 
was 
too 
much 
for 
the 
inexperienced 
Oskar 
Autio 
— who was starting his first 
collegiate game. Raabe cut right, 
but smacked a backhanded shot 
into the net to break open the 
scoring.
“Usually 
for 
left-handers 
coming down the left, it’s kind 
of a standard move a lot of guys 
do –– forehand, backhand, five-
hole,” Raabe said. “So, that’s 
kind of what I was going for.”
And from there, the goals 
started to rain in for the 
Wolverines. Scoring four goals 
in a period against Penn State 
isn’t new. Michigan has done 
it twice in the previous two 
meetings. But this time, there 
was a defense to back it up.
“Our guys did the simple 
things. We got to the net,” 
Pearson said. “We stopped in 
front of the net. Pucks and people 
to the net and we competed 
there. We haven’t done a lot 
of — first period, we didn’t do 
any of that. If you look at the 
shot chart, everything’s off to 
the side. There’s nothing from 
in front. You look at the second 
period, we’re getting to the net.”
With 
the 
Nittany 
Lions’ 
offense unable to start up, the 
Wolverines’ offense took over. A 
little over halfway through the 
period, they scored three goals 
in under a minute to create the 
separation they haven’t been 
able to all season.
Lambert battled against the 
boards and came up clean with 
the puck. He cut toward the net 
where he saw Slaker waiting 
at the opposite side of the net 
unguarded. The passing game 
and the goal followed.
“Jimmy made a great play to 
me,” Slaker said, “And I was just 
kind of sitting there, wide open, 
so I just had to do my job as soon 
as he got it to me.”
Leaving 
little 
time 
for 
celebration, 
senior 
Nicholas 

Boka scored a goal 14 seconds 
after. Penn State made a bad pass 
in the defensive zone that led 
to freshman Nick Blankenberg 
stealing the puck. He took the 
puck to the net but failed to 
convert. Boka, however, was in 
the right place to clean it up. He 
curled around towards the right 
of the net, where the rebound 
had leaked, and hit a low shot 
that went past Autio.
Thirty-eight 
seconds 
after 
that, Lockwood scored his ninth 
goal of the season. He initially 
shot on net and a fight in traffic 
ensued. The puck leaked out 
back to where Lockwood lied in 
wake, and he converted on the 
distracted goalie.
The period was the breakout 
Michigan looked to have all 
season, and the momentum 
stayed 
until 
the 
ending 
seconds of the second period. A 
breakaway by the Nittany Lions 
forced senior defenseman Joseph 
Cecconi to take a roughing 
penalty to stop the Penn State 
skater from converting.
The penalty bled into the 
third period, but Michigan had 
no problems with the penalty 
kill, a consistent trait for the 
team all season.
The 
Wolverines 
drew 
a 
power 
play 
of 
their 
own, 
after junior defenseman Luke 
Martin got slashed clearing 
the puck. The man-advantage 
ended with a few high-quality 

chances for both sides but no 
goal. However, minutes after, 
senior forward Brendan Warren 
hooked a players leg to prevent a 
breakaway.
Right as the penalty ended, 
Penn State scored a goal. A 
Nittany Lion skater centered a 
pass, but it deflected off of Boka’s 
skate and in between Lavigne’s 
legs that ended what would have 
been Lavigne’s second shut out 
of the year.
“Just in control. He just looks 
calm in the net, keeps things 
simple, 
doesn’t 
overreact,” 
Pearson 
said. 
“But 
he’s 
competing. He’s really working 
hard to compete on every shot”
Nick Pastujov committed a 
penalty that put Penn State on 
the power place again. Down 
three, the Nittany Lions opted 
to pull their goaltender for the 
6-on-4 
advantage. 
However, 
freshman forward Garrett Van 
Wyhe gained a rebound at the 
blue line and took a long look at 
the net. With no one around him 
to contest the shot, he sealed the 
game with an empty netter.
“I think for us, we were 
focused on defense more,” Slaker 
said. “And our defense led to our 
offense tonight. When we keep 
them to one goal that gives us a 
pretty good opportunity to win 
a game every game. So if we can 
do that night in and night out, as 
long as we get two (goals), that’s 
a win.”

Second period stretch propels Wolverines

All it took was 52 seconds.
At the end of that stretch, 
the 
game 
was 
effectively 
over. The Michigan hockey 
team drained any momentum 
Penn State had left, scoring 
three goals in under a minute 
to extend its lead to 4-0 with 
5:47 remaining in the second 
period.
It started on the power play.
Freshman forward Jimmy 
Lambert was in a scrum for 
the puck along the left boards. 
He escaped with possession, 
creating space for himself. 
As he drifted towards the left 
faceoff circle, the freshman 
floated a backhanded pass 
across 
to 
junior 
forward 
Jake Slaker in the right slot. 
Slaker fired a one-timer past 
goaltender Oskar Autio’s glove 
side to give the Wolverines a 
2-0 lead.
“Big-time play on the Slaker 

goal,” said Michigan coach 
Mel Pearson. “He does a good 
job on the wall, steps up, wins 
a battle, steps off and has the 
poise and presence and vision 
... He’s got talent. He’s just 
connecting the dots, and he 
had a good game tonight.”
Just 
14 
seconds 
later, 
Michigan 
scored again.
Freshman 
forward 
Nick 
Blankenburg 
— in his debut 
as 
a 
forward 
— 
collected 
the 
puck 
on 
an errant pass 
intended 
for 
forward 
Alec 
Marsh in the 
Nittany Lions’ defensive zone. 
Blankenburg deked past one 
defender, making him fall to 
the ice, and made a beeline 
for the net. Though the initial 
shot 
was 
blocked, 
senior 
defenseman 
Nicholas 
Boka 

crashed the net and cleaned up 
the loose puck. He fired a shot 
past Autio, who was sprawled 
out in the crease after saving 
Blankenburg’s attempt.
Boka’s goal came as the 
crowd was still on its feet 
celebrating 
the 
goal 
from 
Slaker. And 38 seconds later, 
Michigan 
completed 
its 
second-period 
assault on Penn 
State.
After 
sophomore 
forward 
Michael 
Pastujov forced 
a turnover in 
the right faceoff 
circle 
in 
the 
Wolverines’ offensive zone, 
junior forward Will Lockwood 
secured the loose puck. He 
got a shot on net which was 
saved by Autio. Michigan had 
several shot attempts in the 
scrum that ensued in front of 

the net, Lockwood finished 
what he started as circled back 
towards the net and flicked 
the puck into the back of the 
net, 4-0.
It was like an all-out blitz 
of sorts that seemed to catch 
the Nittany Lions off guard. 
Michigan 
continued 
the 
pressure and kept Penn State 
on their heels for the entirety 
of 
those 
52 
seconds 
and 
emerged on the other end with 
a 4-0 lead. 
“We would’ve been happy 
with three goals, probably, in 
the game, the way we were 
going,” Pearson said. “… (We) 
came through tonight. That’s 
good. It’s nice to see them 
rewarded by getting to the net. 
We have to do more of that. We 
have to get those gritty goals. 
We’re not gonna make a lot of 
great plays and fancy plays. 
We have to simplify things. If 
we can do that, then we have 
enough guys who are hungry 
around the net.”
