19 'U' students

B By CLAIRE GOSCICKI
Daily StaffReporter
All University affiliates cur-,
rently in Japan are safe and
clear of the danger caused by a
8.9-magnitude earthquake and
tsunami that wreaked havoc on

the country's northeast coast on
Friday.
There were 19 University
undergraduate and graduate stu-
dents and two faculty members
in Japan when the earthquake
and tsunami hit, according to
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald. All of them were out
of harm's way, and the Universi-
ty has been in contact with each
individual, Fitzgerald said.
"None of them are in the hard-
est hit area," he said.

The undergraduate students
are overseas for University-
sponsored study abroad pro-
grams, but the graduate students
are in Japan to conduct research,
according to Fitzgerald, who said
he didn't know why the faculty
members were in the country.
It's unclear whether the stu-
dents or faculty plan to evacuate
the country, Fitzgerald added.

ority was to make contact and

Thousands rally in Beirut to
demand Hezbollah disarm

Hezbollah will not
respond to protests,
representative says
BEIRUT (AP) - Tens of thou-
sands of supporters of Lebanon's
pro-Western opposition thronged
downtown Beirut yesterday,
demanding that the Iranian-
backed militant group Hezbollah
give up its weapons.
The rally was a potent show
of support for Lebanon's toppled
prime minister Saad Hariri, who
moved into the opposition after
Hezbollah and its allies forced his
government to collapse in Janu-
ary.
"We want to place the weapons
at the disposal of the state because
it is the state that unites us all and
it is the army that protects us all,"
Hariri said, shouting over the
crowd as they cheered and waved
Lebanon's national flag.

Hariri has taken a far stronger
public stance against Hezbollah
in recent weeks than he did dur-
ing his 14 months as prime minis-
ter, suggesting that the country's
political deadlock is far from over.
Ghaleb Abu Zeinab, a member
of Hezbollah's political bureau,
said the group will not respond to
yesterday's gathering.
But a slew of billboards has
popped up in Beirut lately, say-
ing "Israel also wants Hezbollah
disarmed" - a clear message that
Hezbollah sees its weapons as a
necessary safeguard against its
enemies.
Hariri accuses the militant
group, which is backed by Syria
and Iran, of using its weapons for
intimidation and political lever-
age.
Yesterday's rally heightens
growing tensions in Lebanon over
a U.N. tribunal investigating the
2005 assassination of Hariri's
father, former prime minister

Rafik Hariri.
The Hague-based court is
widely expected to accuse Hez-
bollah members of involvement in
the killing in indictments issued
two months ago but which remain
sealed. Hezbollah vehemently
denies having anything to do
with the killing, and its ministers
walked out of Saad Hariri's gov-
ernment when he refused to cut
ties with the tribunal.
Hezbollah and its allies then
secured enough support in par-
liament to name Najib Mikati
as their pick for prime minister.
Mikati has emphasized that he
will not do the bidding of any one
side in Lebanon's fractious poli-
tics, but he is still struggling to
form a Cabinet.
Opponents of Hezbollah -
which the U.S. considers a terror-
ist organization - say having an
Iranian proxy at the helm of Leb-
anon's government would lead to
international isolation.

Exhibit on Vishnu introduces
Hindu art to U.S. audiences

Curators aim to
increase awareness
of Hinduism in art
NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP)
- Hinduism is the world's third
largest religion and its oldest con-
tinuously practiced one, so it's
somewhat surprising there has
never been a major U.S. museum
exhibition on Vishnu, one of its
most important deities.
"Vishnu: Hinduism's Blue-
Skinned Savior" is a new exhibit
at Nashville's Frist Center for the
Visual Arts that aims to introduce
American art audiences to the
visual beauty of the intricate ways
Hindus throughout time have ren-
dered their deities.
Curator Joan Cummins, of the
Brooklyn Museum, described the

goals of the exhibit recently dur-
ing a private tour.
"First, to introduce one aspect
of a major world religion, Hindu-
ism, to a largely uninitiated audi-
ence," she said. "We assume they
are intelligent but don't know
almost anything about Hinduism.
"Second, to show absolutely
gorgeous Indian art - the very
best material from collections all
over the world, the most beautiful
and rarest examples."
Vishnu is one of Hinduism's
three most important gods,
although that description is
somewhat misleading. Hinduism
scholar Joanne Waghorne, a reli-
gion professor at Syracuse Univer-
sity, said many Hindus, but not all,
believe the religion's many differ-
ent deities are simply aspects of a
single divinity.
Vishnu is easily recognizable in

paintings by his blue skin.
"His association with the skies
is one explanation for his blue
skin," Cummins said, "but really
it's not explained very well in
scripture. His skin is just blue."
His role among the Hindu dei-
ties is the preserver. He maintains
balance and is usually depicted
with a very erect posture. Like
many Hindu gods, Vishnu is often
shown with multiple arms, sym-
bolizing his ability to do many
things at once.
A beautifully preserved sand-
stone stele produced in the 10th
century in central India - "Vish-
nu Flanked by His Personified
Attributes" - is one of the intro-
ductory pieces in the first gal-
leries. It is one of several pieces
that has never been seen outside
its home museum or appeared in
publications.

Bus sliced in half
on N.Y. highway
killed 14 early
Saturday morning
NEW YORK (AP) - Passen-
gers and witnesses to a horrific
crash that sheared the top off
a bus and killed 14 people told
investigators that the driver's
account of getting clipped by a
tractor-trailer didn't match up to
what they felt and saw before the
vehicle slid off the road and into
a sign pole.
Driver Ophadell Williams had
told police that his World Wide
Travelbus was hit just as it crossed
the New York City line early Sat-
urday on a trip from the Mohegan
Sun casino in in Connecticut.
But passengers said Williams
had already swerved at times to
the right for no reason before the
accident, a law enforcement offi-
cial said yesterday. The official
wasn't authorized to speak pub-
licly about the probe and spoke
on condition of anonymity.
The bus was returning to
Manhattan's Chinatown after a
quick overnight trip to the casino.
The official said that passengers
said they didn't feel anything hit
them and that other motorists on
Interstate 95 said they didn't see
the bus get hit. The official said

police spoke to the tractor-trailer
driver, who said he was following
the bus.
Williams remained hospital-
ized in stable condition yesterday
and has not commented publicly.
His family could not be reached.
As many as 20 passengers
were treated at hospitals follow-
ing the accident. Nine remained
hospitalized, including the bus
driver, at St. Barnabas Hospital
and Jacobi Medical Center. Most
were in critical condition.
Officials at Jacobi were still
trying to identify one passenger,
an Asian man in his 50s, spokes-
woman Barbara DeIorio said.
"He's very injured. He's not
able to communicate yet," she
said, adding that the man was in
the surgical intensive care unit.
The 14 victims - eight men
and six women - all died of blunt
force trauma, said Ellen Borak-
ove, a spokeswoman for the New
York City medical examiner's
office. She said the office was
working with family members to
identify them.
The National Transportation
Safety Board has interviewed
two passengers from the bus,
but it hasn't spoken to the bus
driver or the driver of the truck,
Vice Chairman Christopher
Hart said at a news conference
late Sunday.
He said the investigation was
still in its early stages, but the

NTSB plans to talk to the bus
company to see what kind of
fatigue management the com-
pany has in place. Investigators
will also look into the casino's
records to see whether the driv-
er checked into a room there.
The NTSB will analyze three
devices: a camera mounted in
the bus facing the passengers;
an engine control module, which
may tell how fast the bus was
going; and a GPS tracking device
from the tractor-trailer, said
Hart.
Some of the 31 passengers
were still asleep when the bus
crashed at 5:35 a.m. Saturday.
The-bus scraped alongtheguard-
rail for 300 feet, toppled and
crashed into the support pole
for a highway sign indicating the
exit for the Hutchinson Parkway.
The pole knifed through the bus
front to back along the window
line, peeling the roof off all the
way to the back tires.
The bus was one of scores that
travel daily between Chinatown
and the Foxwoods and Mohe-
gan Sun casinos in southeastern
Connecticut.
Mohegan Sun, in Uncasville,
Conn., has estimated a fifth of
its business comes from Asian
spending and caters to Chinese-
American gamblers. Its website
has a Chinese-language section
offering gaming and bus promo-
tions.

Tons of dead
sardines scooped

Cleaning crews yesterday fin-

found floating dead in a Southern
California marina, five days after
the slimy, stinking mass of sar-
dines was discovered.
Crews from several coastal cit-

removed about 140 tons of dead
sardines from King Harbor in
 Redondo Beach, city officials said
in a statement.
The fish were taken to a com-

The city said that while the
fish were gone, local crews will
continue cleaning up the after-
math of the die-off in the harbor
for another week.
Biologists from the University
of Southern California and the
California Department of Fish
and Game have said critically low
oxygen levels in the water caused
the sardines to suffocate.

By late in the afternoon, the
crippled Waterfront restaurant
was sitting in the river near a

The restaurant broke loose on

set to begin in October, which
is later than some city officials
were expecting.
"I think we all expected con-
struction to begin this spring,"
Ann Arbor City Council mem-
ber Sabra Briere (D-Ward 1)
said. She added that the pros-
pect of construction not begin-
ning until October is "very
disappointing."
The bridges were built in 1917
and 1928 and have received a
Federal Sufficiency Rating of
only two out of a 100-pointscale.
According to Briere, both bridg-
es are monitored "constantly"
by city engineers to ensure the
public's continued safety.
The construction activ-
ity will necessitate closure of a
section of East Stadium Boule-
vard from Nov. 28 through the
duration of the project, accord-
ing to Senior Project Manager
Michael Nearing. South State
Street will also be closed for
about two weeks this December
to allow for the demolition of
one bridge.
Nearing said he is not expect-
ing "any major difficulties"
regarding road closures. He
added that officials will moni-
tor the detour and will make
"modifications as needed" dur-
ing the construction process.
Officials are working on final-
izing construction plans and
expect to have them completed
by early June. Bids will then be
solicited through the Michigan
Department of Transportation
during September.

The U.S. State Department

John Greisberger, director of
the University's International
Center, offered his condolences
to about 100 international stu-
dents from Japan studying at
the University through an e-mail
sent on Friday.
"The International Center
was reaching out to all of the stu-
dents ... to express our concerns
for them and their families and
also to see if any of them needed
any assistance," Fitzgerald said.
Yoshiki Masada, president of
the Japan Student Association
on campus, wrote in an e-mail
interview last night that the
organization raised money at
their annual Japan Culture Fes-
tival on Saturday to help those
affected by the earthquake and

tsunami.
"When we heard of (the earth-
quake), we knew we had to help
Japan through this event," he
wrote.
With the United Asian Ameri-
can Organization, Masada wrote
that the group raised more than
$600 and is planning to set up
more support efforts. The Japan
Business Association at the Uni-
versity is also planning to raise
funds to aid Japan, according to
Masada.
One of the most perilous situa-
tions was at the Fukushima Dai-
ichi nuclear complex where one
explosion occurred Saturday.
Because the earthquake elimi-
nated the plant's power supply
and the tsunami flooded backup
generators, Japanese govern-
ment officials were concerned
that another explosion was
imminent.
Residents who lived within 12
miles of the Dai-ichi plant had
been preemptively evacuated.
Officials said that 1,500 people
have been examined for radia-
tion poisoning and at least 160
people may have been exposed to
radiation.
The incidents at the plants
have resulted in a power short-
age throughout Japan, with
about 2 million homes out of
power yesterday. Today, rolling
blackouts will be used in Tokyo
and other cities to preserve elec-
tricity.

million for the construction,
and the state's Transportation
Enhancement Funding pro-
gram will provide an additional
$1.2 million.
According to Nearing, the
city's portion of the bill is about
$6.2 million and will be covered
by a variety of sources includ-
ing road repair millages.
However, recently proposed
cuts to the 2011 federal budget
in the U.S. House of Represen-
tatives have called into question
the TIGER II funding. Accord-
ing to Briere, council members
have not been told that the Sta-
dium bridges' specific funds are
in jeopardy.
According to Ann Arbor
Council member Christopher
Taylor (D-Ward 3), even if
federal funding for the project
were compromised, the city
would move forward with its
plans.

"Building the bridges is
imperative, and it will be done,"
Taylor said.
According to the city's
TIGER II grant application, the
entire cost to repair the bridges
will be made up in less than
a year since the city will save
money from fewer car crashes
and delays, and more people
will travel to Ann Arbor.
The construction will also
provide an opportunity to add
bike lanes, a wider sidewalk,
energy-efficient LED bulbs
for streetlights on each of the
bridges and will eliminate vehi-
cle weight restrictions.
In the project planning stag-
es, Nearing said the bridges
pose no threat to motorists and
pedestrians.
"They don't look very nice,"
he said. "They're kind of run
down, but they're not hazard-
ous at all."

Top Iraqi lawmakers, ministers
investigated for forged documents

About 20,000
employees may have
false credentials
BAGHDAD (AP) - Iraq's par-
liament is investigating some
20,000 government employees
who appear to have used fake
diplomas and other forged edu-
cation certificates to get their
jobs, a lawmaker said yesterday.
Layla Hassan, a lawmaker
and member of an investigatory
panel, said employees with fake
credentials may include minis-
ters, deputy ministers and other
top lawmakers.
"Some of those who have fake
education certificates are senior
officials in the current and for-
mer government," Hassan said in
an interview, declining to name
any until the investigation is
complete.
"These people should not be
pardoned. Otherwise, others will

do the same in the future," she
said.
Officials from Iraq's higher
education ministry could not be
reached for comment.
The revelation could further
anger many Iraqis, as frustration
with shoddy government ser-
vices, corruption and high unem-
ployment have prompted dozens
of protests across the country in
recent weeks.
The use of fake diplomas has
become widespread the last sev-
eral years, creating a thriving
black market in a country with 15
percentunemployment.
The use of such documents
"has a devastating effect on the
country, because it means that
it is being run by inefficient and
even illiterate people," saidBagh-
dad political analyst Hadi Jalo.
Jalo blamed the surge in forg-
eries on the lack of law enforce-
ment that followed the 2003
U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. During
Saddam Hussein's government,

when life-threatening penalties
were imposed against criminals,
the use of fake documents was
mostly limited to passports to
leave Iraq, Jalo said.
The costs range from $1,500
for a high school diploma to
$7,000 for Ph.D. credentials,
according to a forger interviewed
yesterday in Baghdad's poor Sadr
City neighborhood.
The man, who would iden-
tify himself only as Abu Haidar,
claimed that the forgers are pro-
tected by police and some gov-
ernment officials.
Parliament may not require
offenders to return their pay-
checks if they voluntarily
acknowledge getting their
government jobs with fake
credentials, said Hassan, the
lawmaker. But they will face jail
time if convicted, she said.
Iraq is struggling with solidi-
fying its fragile democracy,
while insurgents seek to under-
mine it with attacks.

Project aims to
reverse years of
disconnect
NEW YORK (AP) - For
decades, development in New
York was about concrete, sky-
scrapers and roads - highways
that often ringed the city and
kept people from the hundreds
of miles of waterfront shoreline
that help define the city. Now, the
city's first waterfront plan in two
decades will spend billions of dol-
lars to reunite New Yorkers with
their water.
The $3 billion-plus plan, to be
announced by the Bloomberg
administration today, would add
SO new acres of parks, expand
dozens more, overhaul the city's
sewage system to reduce waste
pushed into the rivers and dredge
waterways to make room for
giants ships that are rarely seen
on the East Coast.
The blueprint is New York
City's attempt to reverse more
than a century of planning that
left much of the city's 520 miles
of shoreline inaccessible to resi-

dents and instead directed them
inland for their recreation and
relaxation.
"New York City has more
miles of waterfront than Seat-
tle, San Francisco, Chicago,
and Portland combined - but
for decades, too many neigh-
borhoods have been blocked
off from it," Mayor Michael
Bloomberg said in a statement.
our-waterfront-and water-
ways - what we are calling New
York City's sixth borough - are
invaluable assets, and when our
work is complete, New York City
will again be known as one of
the world's premier waterfront
cities."
For much of the city's history,
the waterfront was viewed more
as dumping ground than desti-
nation. The Erie Canal's opening
in the early 1800s made the city
America's main port, and indus-
trial toxins and human waste
turned much of New York Har-
bor to muck. The harbor's oys-
ters died, methane gas bubbled
to the surface, and the horrific
smell wafted inland and kept
the city's upper class far from
the water.

After violence, new settlement
housing approved in West Bank

Mourners shocked
by details of deaths
and bloody assault
JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel
responded defiantly yesterday
to a bloody Palestinian assault
against West Bank settlers by
approving construction of new
settlement housing, retaliat-
ing for the stabbing deaths of a
father, mother and three small
children with a measure that
infuriated Palestinians and,
together with the attack, threw
already shaky peace efforts into
a new tailspin.
Even in a country long accus-
tomed to violence, the grisly
details of the killings late Friday
stunned Israel. Among the vic-
tims were a 4-year-old boy and
his baby sister. Their pictures
leaped from Israel's front pages,
pushing news of the Japanese
earthquake and tsunami disas-
ter aside. As Israel's military
searched for the Palestinian
suspects in a broad sweep in the
WestBank, thousandsofmourn-
ers thronged a Jerusalem ceme-
tery for the funeral.
"There is not a Jewish heart
that is not shedding a tear,"
Chief Rabbi Yona Metzger said

in a eulogy, his voice cracking
in anguish. "After such horrific
pictures, with whom do we have
to sit and talk peace?"
Mourners screamed and
wailed as the bodies of the three
male victims were brought in
wrapped in white and black
prayer shawls, the two females
in blue shrouds. The pouch con-
taining the infant was no larger
than a potato sack.
Many rocked back and forth
in prayer as speakers addressed
the audience, and family mem-
bers collapsed in grief. Some
mourners bore signs in Hebrew
reading, "The government
demolishes homes, Arabs mur-
der Jews."
The bloodshed, which shat-
tered a lengthy lull in the West
Bank, threatened to drive Israe-
li-Palestinian peacemaking even
further out of reach. Peace talks
have been stalled since Sep-
tember, and the combination of
deadly violence against Israelis
and new settlement construc-
tion was likely to deepen the
mutual distrust.
Officials said assailants cut
through a fence surrounding the
settlement of Itamar, entered
the home of the Fogel family and
killed the parents - Udi, 36, and
Ruth, 35, - and three of their

children, Yoav, 11, Elad, 4 and
3-month-old Hadas.
An older daughter who was
out with friends came home and
discovered the carnage. The
attack took place shortly after
the family finished the weekly
dinner celebrating the Jewish
Sabbath.
Footage of the gory scene
broadcast on Israeli media
showed children's toys in pools
of blood and tipped over furni-
ture. A settler group released
photos of the dead lying on the
floor with bloody wounds. One
of the pictures showed the body
of a baby and an adult laying on
blood soaked sheets, further
shocking already traumatized
Israelis.
Israel indirectly blamed the
Palestinian government for the
carnage. Israel has long con-
tended that Palestinian text-
books and official media are
full of hatred toward the Jewish
state, and that killers of Israelis
are often glorified.
Yesterday, a group of activ-
ists from Palestinian President
Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah move-
ment dedicated a square in the
West Bank city of Ramallah
after Dalal Mughrabi, a female
militant who carried out a 1978
bus attack that killed 37 Israelis.

'Emergency power plav
Michigan EFM legislation subverts voter will
State Republicans silenced the outcries of opposition on Wednes-
day when they passed emergency financial manager legislation,
which grants exclusive powers to governor-appointed officials
in emergency situations. The bill passed in the Senate and will go back
to the House for minor changes before it's placed on Republican Gov.
Rick Snyder's desk. The new bill far exceeds the level of control that
a non-elected official should have, and with its passing there will be
many decisions that Michigan voters won't have control over.

devote this column to thank-
ing four very special people:
Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.), Gov.
Scott Walker
(R-Wisc.), Rep.
Michelle Bach-
mann (R-Minn.)
and former _
Arkansas Gov.
Mike Huckabee.
Our nation
owes these IMRAN
people a lot. We SYED
owe to them the
survival of the
core of Ameri-
can greatness - the vitality of our
democracy. We should never forget
what these special people did for our
country in its time of need. Let me
explain.
America is great. Yes, the reces-
sion was bad, but even at its deepest,
90 percent of us still had jobs. Yeah,
the Afghanistan and Iraq wars have
been bloody and costly, but odds are
that most of us were not personally
affected enough to continually care.
Even with all that going on, it's easy
for the average American to just go
home, turn on the game, grab a beer
and forget everything.
Let that apathy continue long
enough, and this country would lose
the last remaining tinges of demo-
cratic activism and dialogue that its
founding was rooted in. But fear not
because four heroes have saved us
from that awful fate.
Thank you, King, for reminding
America of what we cannot afford to
become. It had been too long since we
had a good, old-fashioned witch-hunt
around here, and your congressional
hearings on "the radicalization of
American Muslims" really hit the
spot. After years of subtly question-
ing the loyalty of every American
Muslim and the place of Islam in

the pool .of possible life choices a
freedom-loving American may make,
the Right finally had the chance to
spread its wings at those hearings.
Turns out thatgiving Republicans
control of the House (which made
King chair of the Committee on
Homeland Security) was just what
we needed to do. The lunacy of the
extreme Right's position on social
issues will continue to be brought
to the fore for the next few months.
Thank you for lettingus voters take a
good long look at what we cannot let
this countrybecome.
Thank you, Walker, for being the
first of the Tea Party fundamental-
ists to succeed at implementing the
ludicrous agenda the crazies have
been barking about for a couple
years. You accepted no compro-
mise from cowering Democrats, no
matter how much they caved. You
showed no mercy, and you won.
Whereas your fellow Republicans
only subtly blamed unions for every
problem this country has had since
the dawn of time, you are a man of
action. Thank you for reinvigorating
the working class and for waking up
the sleeping giant that is labor vote
- in Wisconsin, but also across the
country and especially here in Mich-
igan. Come election time, they'll be
sure to pay you Tea Party folks back.
My thank you to Bachmann
could be for any number of things;
no one has a more decorated record
of obliviously invigorating the pro-
gressive cause than the woman who
never met an issue she couldn't mis-
understand and misconstrue. This
particular thank you, however, goes
to Bachmann for introducing the
"Lightbulb Freedom of Choice Act."
Back in 2007, Congress imple-
mented new standards for light
bulbs; they had to meet a base level
of efficiency, or they'd be phased out.

But, as Bachmann pointed out, "The
government has no business telling
an individual what kind of lightbulb
to buy." Never mind that the govern-
ment isn't actually doing that. Never
mind that using an efficient light
bulb is a nearly effortless way to save
money and the environment. Never
mind that Bachmann is adding to
the bureaucracy she claims to hate
by proposing a useless bill.
We owe them the
survival of U.S.
democracy.
And finally, Huckabee. You lov-
able teddy bear with the venomous
fangs of a viper. Your contribution
is the most direct to the immediate
future of our democracy. By igno-
rantly questioning and deriding
President Barack Obama's multicul-
tural background, you have made
him - the most powerful man in
the world - look like a victim. The
Obama political machine didn't
need any help, but thank you, Mike
Huckabee, for reminding voters how
much you and your party hate any-
one who is a little different.
These four individuals, and the
hundreds of others in government,
cable news and talk radio who spew
similar evil, have saved this coun-
try. The electorate might have been
lulled into a blissful nap, but they
have shaken us awake - just in time
for the 2012 election.
We owe them everything.

Once approved by Snyder, the EFM will
have the ability to control a wide array of gov-
ernment spending. According to a March 10
Detroit News article, among other powers,
these one-year appointees will now be able to
sell government assets, toss out local ordinanc-
es and take total control of school curricula.
Twenty amendments proposed by Democrats
were rejected by Republicans, including an
attempt to limit an EFM's salary to that of the
governor's, which is $177,000.
This bill further removes citizens from
government and looks much less like democ-
racy, especially the kind that Republicans
espouse. These officials have one person to
report to, and that's the governor. And while
these positions may be in place for emergen-
cy situations, the definition of such events is
obviously subject to interpretation. There's
no way to ensure that there will be no abuse
of EFM power. Republicans may dictate that
having to negotiate with a union qualifies as
an emergency, and under this new legislation
the EFM would be able to terminate union
employee contracts.
Iteexsn like the state-trgislature is trying-
to avoid the turmoil that overcame Wiscon-
sin's government in recent weeks and bypass
the step in which citizens can try to influence
government decisions. With EFMs, decisions

would be made, and voters would have no
choice but to sit back and deal with the conse-
quences.
Among the more alarming powers, EFMs
will be able to undermine the decisions of local
elected government officials. It is even more
authoritarian for these EFMs to be able to con-
trol school curricula, since there's no guaran-
tee they will have a background in education.
Detroit's EFM, Robert Bobb, has been an effec-
tive adjudicator for Detroit and was appointed
and reappointedby former Democrat Gov. Jen-
nifer Granholm, but even an exemplary EFM
should be barred from dictating what schools
teach.
Snyder has been comparing Michigan to
Wisconsin and wants to prevent Wisconsin's
recent crisis from manifesting here. This new
bill may be a way to avert the same mess, but
it is also avoiding a true democratic process.
For appointed officials to be able to subvert the
power of elected officials shows a disregard for
the will of voters.
Unfortunately, once the House finishes
revising the bill, it will land on Snyder's desk
-and-will-likely be signed into law. If the policy
takes effect, Snyder needs to work with local
governments and schools to make sure that
implementation of an EFM is a mutual and
beneficial decision.

Last spring, MForward emerged as a group of dedi-
cated individuals united by a common aspiration to
improve student governance on campus and commit-
ment to making the Michigan Student Assembly a true
advocate for students of this university. This spring,
we're reaffirming our values with a new slate of indi-
viduals determined to advance the MForward agenda of
ideas, action and community.
This is why I have decided to run for president with
MForward, along with LSA Junior Brendan Campbell
as my running mate and a phenomenal ticket of student
leaders from across every section of campus. Collec-
tively, we share the goal of re-energizing student par-
ticipation in governance as a means of affecting change
with benefits that will reach every corner of our campus
community.
Our work begins with establishing new forums for
exchanging ideas. As a whole, we hope to create a more
accessible, transparent and efficient coalition of student
representatives. In order to better communicate with
and assess the needs of our peers, we plan to broadcast
MSA meetings, hold monthly presidential addresses and
host frequent town hall gatherings that connect stu-
dents with University administrators. In these settings,
we can both express our ideas so that they may fall sub-
ject to discussion and debate among the community, as
well as elicit feedback and suggestions from those whose
interests we're strivingto serve.
We also would like to emphasize our relationship
with other student-led organizations, as we consider
them vital to the vibrancy of our campus fabric. By intro-
ducing rolling funding opportunities and holding office
hours in multiple locations around campus, organiza-
tions will have increased access to our resources. Fur-
thermore, we intend to open our legislative process to
student groups by creating a system that allows student
organizations to pass resolutions through MSA.
Once we have implemented these tools for increasing
our engagement with the student body, we will actively
fight to enhance the campus community through our
commitment to improving accessibility and affordabil-
ity. Alongside student organizations, we intend to create
new programming and outreach initiatives to connect
with communities currently underrepresented at the
University.
By reaching out to high schools across the state, we
will unify the voices of students to establish networks of
peer support. Such dialogue, coupled with advocacy for
more education grants for students of different minority
groups, has the potential to diminish the gap between
high school and college that can become insurmount-
able to so many of our state's youth. In our actions, we

hope not only to create opportunities of higher educa-
tion thatpreviously didn't existbut also seek to diversify
and enrich our campus culture.
In terms of affordability, cuts to funding higher
education have led to tuition hikes that hurt students
across every demographic. Because the members of
MForward believe so passionately in fighting for the
needs of the students we represent, we see it as our
responsibility to lead the effort of keeping these trends
in check. While we will strive to use our institutional
resources for the benefit of our peers, we also will not
hesitate to take a stand against these institutions when
students' academic careers become jeopardized by
financial constraints.
Finally, the overarching aspiration of MForward is
to build a better and more cohesive campus community.
All students deserveto feel included in the dynamic aca-
demic, extracurricular and social environments around
which our campus culture thrives, These initiatives
begin with continuing MForward's efforts to implement
open housing.
While progress has been made on this issue in that
transgender and gender non-conforming students will
now be able to live in suites with other students of their E
choosing - regardless of gender - much work still
remains in advocating for a full open housing program.
In a similar vein, we also will seek to establish a more
comprehensive system to address incidents of bias. We
see it as critical that students' safety and positive cam-
pus experiences aren't threatened by intolerant atti-
tudes toward different social identities.
As part of the largest governing entity on campus,
MForward members feel a compelling responsibility
to use MSA resources only in ways that serve to unite
students with each other, with their campus environ-
ment, with their communities and with the tools they
require for accomplishing their goals. By opening up
waves of communication between students, student-
led organizations and the administration, we have the
unique potential to facilitate connections with new and
enhanced educational and organizational opportunities.
This is why Brendan Campbell, myself and all the
MForward candidates have decided to seek positions on
MSA this year. We're students, seeking the support of
students, and promising to strengthen the student body.
If we all work together as a united force, we can further
define and embody the phrase "Leaders and the Best"
- that ever-present classification to which we so firmly
subscribe.
DeAndree Watson is the MForward
presidential candidate. He is an LSA junior.


Responsible citizens should
be allowed to carry guns
TO THE DAILY:
In Seth Soderborg's March 9 article (All
guns were not created equal, (3/7/2011), he sug-
gests that semi automatic pistols should be
banned in favor of small revolvers with a short
range and small cartridge capacity. However,
former presidents Ronald Reagan, Abraham
Lincoln, James Garfield, William McKinley
and Theodore Roosevelt were all shot by small
pistols with a short range and small cartridge
capacity. Former President John F. Kennedy
was killed with a hunting rifle, which Soder-
borg would permit. We must realize that
nearly all shootings occur in "gun-free" or gun-
restricted zones. The bloodiest shootings have
been at places like Columbine High School,
Virginia Tech University and Fort Hood, all
places where firearms are prohibited.
This is no coincidence. A shooting is more
likely to occur in a school than at a shooting
range. Making the United States a gun-restrict-

ed zone would put us all at risk. No law will
ever be able to keep guns out of the hands of
dangerous people: It will only disarm respon-
sible citizens.
Soderborg is comfortable with police offi-
cers carrying semi automatic pistols. Howev-
er, we must remember that police officers are
human, just like concealed pistol license hold-
ers. Earlier this year, a middle school student
- the son of a police officer - used his father's
service weapon to kill the vice principal at
his school. What is the difference between a
police officer and a CPL holder? The only dif-
ference is that police officers must take an
oath. Would making CPL holders take an oath
reassure the public?
Most police officers do very little weapons
training after certification. It's very easy for
a private citizen to amass more trigger time
than a police officer and thus be more profi-
cient with his or her pistol. We can't put a cop
on everycorner,but we have more thanenough
responsible citizens.

SNYDER
From Page 1A
Coleman is recommending that
Snyder be given a Doctor of Law
degree.
"I think one of the messages,
I hope, to graduates is here we
have a UM alum - triple alum as
a matter of fact - who went out
and had a successful career, and
he's come back in public service,
public service in a way he hopes
he can use -his knowledge and
expertise to help build a founda-
tion for the future of the state,"
Coleman said of Snyder.
Before becoming Michigan's
48th governor, Snyder served as
CEO and chair of the board of
Ardesta, LLC, a venture capital
firm Snyder co-founded. While
at Gateway between 1991 and
2007, Snyder also served as exec-
utive vice president, president

and chief operating officer, chair
of the board and interim CEO.
Snyder is also the co-founder of
Ann Arbor SPARK, a regional
business accelerator.
Snyder's post as governor is his
first position held in public office.
"I admire the fact that he was
willing to run (for governor) in a
time when many states are facing
challenges," Coleman said.
During their Thursday meet-
ing - which will be held in
Detroit for the first time - the
regents are also expected to
approve a slew of nominations
for honorary degrees to be given
at commencement. Among those
recipients, Coleman said she is
proposing that honorary degrees
be given to former U.S. Rep. Vern
Ehlers (R-Mich.), William Clay
Ford, Jr., the executive chair of
Ford Motor Company, Spike Lee,
a well-known film and television
producer director and writer, and

Stephen Ross, a University alum,
real estate mogul and prominent
donor to the University.
Additionally, the Board of
Regents will be asked to approve
an honorary degree for Wash-
ington Post Columnist Eugene
Robinson, who has accepted an
invitation to speak at Rackham
Graduate School's graduate exer-
cises in Hill Auditorium on April
29.
Coleman said this year's line-
up of honorary degree recipients
represent beacons of creativity
and hard work.
"It is quite amazing ... " Cole-
man said. "I think they will natu-
rally serve as role models for our
graduates."
Coleman is recommending
that Robinson, also a University
alum and former co-editor in
chief of the Daily, be given a Doc-
tor of Humane Letters. Robinson
is an award-winning journalist,

having won the Pulitzer Prize in
2009 for a series of columns he
wrote while covering then-Sen.
Barack Obama's presidential
campaign.
"(He's) a former Daily report-
er who went on to have a spec-
tacular career," Coleman said.
"It should generate, and I know
it will, lots of pride from the
alums."
Ross is being recommended
for an honorary Doctor of Law
degree. The Business School's
namesake, Ross is well known
on campus for his philanthropy,
including a $100 million gift to
the Business School. He is now
the chair and CEO of The Relat-
ed Companies, L.P., a real estate
firm based in New York.
"(Ross is) a tremendous phi-
lanthropist not only to the Ross
School, but to other areas in the
University as well," Coleman said.
Coleman is also recommend-

ing that Ehlers receive an hon-
orary Doctor of Law degree.
Ehlers, who used to represent
Michigan's third district in the
U.S. House of Representatives, is
also a retired physicist and pro-
fessor at Calvin College in Grand
Rapids, Mich., where he served
as chair of the physics depart-
ment.
"With his advocacy for science
and a scientist himself, he under-
stood what it took to be able to
support great science," Coleman
said. "He was a tireless advocate
for the sciences in Congress, and
we're very proud to honor him."
Pending the regents' approv-
al, Ford is expected to receive
a Doctor of Law degree at com-
mencement as well. Ford has
served in numerous leadership
roles at the Ford Motor Compa-
ny, including his current position
as executive chair and former
position as CEO.

"The Ford Motor Company
has been a tremendous partner
with the University in research,
and over the years, they've been
so generous," Coleman said. "We
are so pleased that Ford has done
well and is on the road, we hope,
to recovery."
Lee is expected to receive
a Doctor of Fine Arts. Calling
him a "creative genius," Cole-
man said, "We're very pleased to
honor his work."
Lee's production company, 40
Acres & A Mule Filmworks, has
produced more than 35 movies.
Lee has also received an Emmy
Award and has been nominated
for two Academy Awards.
Commencement is set to take
place on Saturday, April 30 at 10
a.m. in Michigan Stadium. Rack-
ham's University Graduate Exer-
cises are scheduled for the day
before at 9:30 a.m. in Hill Audi-
torium.


GEO
From Page 1A
poned the date. Once the contract
expires, a new contract will be up
for a vote of approval by the Uni-
versity's Board of Regents.
More rights for GSIs with
disabilities is just one of many
changes that have been suggested
for the new contract during the
26 bargaining sessions that have
taken place since December. Once
implemented, the signed proposal
will be the first article in any Uni-
versity union's contract to outline
the rights of GSIs with disabili-
ties.
While many issues facing
reform under the new contract -
like salaries and benefits related
to child care - have existing

articles under GEO's current con-
tract, the tentative agreement
signed Friday will be a brand new
addition to the contract.
Echols said in her research
of other universities' employee
unions, she hasn't found another
collective bargaining agreement
that allows GSIs to request spe-
cial accommodations.
"This is pretty groundbreaking
because no other union has taken
this on as something to change
employer policy and employer
structure," Echols said. "In terms
of this collective bargaining
agreement, it's really unique."
GEO President Robert
Gillezeau, a GSI in the Depart-
ment of Economics and a gradu-
ate student research assistant for
the Center for Afroamerican and
African Studies agreed with Pat-

rick O'Mahen, former communi-
cations chair of GEO and a former
Michigan Daily columnist, who
called the signing of the proposal
"historic."
The main resource set up for
GSIs with disabilities will be
a process in which instructors
can request accommodations for
their disabilities, according to
Echols. This willbe done through
a similar process for students
with disabilities who go through
the Office of Services for Students
with Disabilities.
Echols said GEO has been
working on the proposal since
last summer and has been negoti-
ating the finalized proposal with
University administrators since
December.
"We hope that the Univer-
sity will use that for all kinds of

employees," Echols said.
Mathieu Desan, a GSI in the
Department of Sociology, said
the administration has been flex-
ible in evaluating all issues under
negotiation except the inclusion
of graduate student research
assistants under GEO's collective
bargaining rights.
GEO has been advocating to
allow GSRAs in the union since
it bargains on their behalf. But
University officials still follow
a 1981 Michigan Employment
Relations Commission regulation
that states GSRAs are foremost
students,and not employees.
Despite this, Desan said he
thinks the administration has
been "really receptive" to their
proposal.
Federico Pous, a GSI in the
Department of Romance Lan-

guages and Literatures, and Jen-
nifer Bowles, a graduate student
fellow, brought their 4-year-old
daughter Iris to the bargaining
session Friday. They are expect-
ing their second child soon.
Pous and Bowles are advocat-
ing for the elimination of a stip-
ulation under the current GEO
contract that requires a 20-hour
work week for both partners in
order for them to have access to
child care resources. Pous said
negotiations with the administra-
tion have been difficult as many
of his propositions during pre-
vious bargaining sessions have
been shot down.
International GSIs are often
denied access to child care
because the University has a poli-
cy that limits the number of work
hours for foreigners, Bowles said,

adding that she hopes GEO's next
contract will change the require-
ment.
Desan said while he isn't a
parent, he sees the struggles his
friends with children go through
and thinks it is important GSIs
are given more support when it
comes to child care.
"I'd like to see the University
move on our child care proposal
in particular," Desan said.
The collective bargaining
agreement will be negotiated
between GEO and the adminis-
tration's bargaining team in two
meetings this week. Gillezeau
said he anticipates the union
and administrators will reach a
consensus at the meetings and
that the agreement will then pro-
ceed to the University's Board of
Regents for approval.

POLICY
From Page 1A
The review of the Depart-
ment of Public Safety's current
policy, according to Scarnecchia,
was prompted after a Univer-
sity faculty member, who had
been issued a trespass warn-
ing, raised concerns and after
the Michigan chapter of the
American Civil Liberties Union
decried the trespass policy
issued against former Michi-
gan Assistant Attorney General
Andrew Shirvell. Shirvell cre-
ated the blog "Chris Armstrong
Watch," which accused Michi-
gan Student Assembly President
Chris Armstrong of putting forth
a "radical homosexual agenda"
in the student government, in
addition to calling him a racist
and elitist.
Currently, four criteria exist
for when University Police may
read a trespass warning: when
an individual has committed or is
suspected of committing a crime
on campus, when an individual
disrupts the operations of the
University, when an individual
poses a risk of physical harm to
others or when an individual
refuses to adhere to University
rules.
Scarnecchia is recommend-

ing the last reason be amended
to limit the scope of when a tres-
pass warning may be issued to
situations in which an individual
refuses to adhere to University
rules that "protect the health,
safety and welfare of the Univer-
sity's community members and
property."
"(We want) to link it to pro-
tection of the community's
safety and not to just any Univer-
sity rule, which could be read too
broadly," Scarnecchia said.
Scarnecchia is also recom-
mending a more streamlined
review process be put in place
once a trespass warning has
been issued. She's proposing
that all DPS officers must submit
notice to their shift supervisor
whenever they issue a trespass
warning so that the supervisor
may review it and recommend
modification or rescission of it
to the DPS executive director if
the supervisor believes it is war-
ranted.
"There's nothing in the policy
that required that, and we think
that a second pair of eyes on the
issuance of the trespass warning
within a very short period of time
... will help ensure consistency
across the department," Scarnec-
chia said.
Additionally, Scarnecchia
is asking that all hearings of

appeals be scheduled within 30
days of an appeal being filed and
that the outcome of the meetings
be decided within 10 days there-
after.
Currently, no time limit exists
for appeals of trespass warnings.
Some have suggested a procedure
in which an automatic appeal be
filed each time a trespass warn-
ing is issued, though Scarnecchia
said she doesn't know whether
such a process would be in any-
one's best interest.
"I'm going to be open to that
conversation and whether or not
that oughtto happen, but... some-
times people understand why
they're beingtrespassed and they
are not inclined to appeal," Scar-
necchia said, mentioning other
circumstances like criminal
charges might also be a reason
why individuals may not want to
appeal their trespass warning.
People have also raised con-
cerns over the appeal process
because only the executive direc-
tor of DPS or his or her desig-
nee can hear appeals. Critics
have said the practice is not as
accountable as an independent
body like the DPS Oversight
Committee - an advisory board
of students, faculty and staff -
reviewing appeals or having the
appeals reviewed by a University
office separate from DPS.

Scarnecchia is also proposing
that a time restriction be placed
on trespass orders, which would
allow individuals back on cam-
pus once a set period of time had
passed. Currently, trespass warn-
ing bans impose a life-long ban
from campus, unless appealed
and modified by the executive
director of DPS.
"One of the biggest weakness
in our current policy is that there
is no time limit on the trespass
warnings," Scarnecchia said. "I
think one of the problems has
been that we haven't done regu-
lar reviews. So once the warn-
ings have been issued, they've
sat in a database somewhere, and
no one has looked at them again
unless the person who receives
the warning comes back and
requests a change."
Though Scarnecchia said put-
ting a time limit on trespass
warnings would be beneficial,
she said it is unclear what type of
limit may be implemented, since
people concerned about the poli-
cy have varying perspectives and
some incidents are more extreme
than others. However, individu-
als with pending criminal cases
would not be subject to the time
limit while their cases are ongo-
ing.
Other proposed policy chang-
es would expand DPS's ability

to enforce trespass warnings by
implementing the warnings at all
University campuses instead of
at the campus where they were
issued.
"We did not have a good state-
ment in the policy of the coor-
dination of the three policies
between Ann Arbor, Flint and
Dearborn," Scarnecchia said.
When the University's Board
of Regents met in Flint, Mich.
last year for one of its monthly
meetings, an individual banned
from the University's Ann Arbor
campus due to a trespass warn-
ing was permitted to address
the regents because she wasn't
explicitly banned from the Flint
campus. Though the office that
coordinates regents meetings
approved the speaker in advance,
Scarnecchia said the example
showed the lack of clarity in the
policy.
"There's a lot of confusion
about whether (trespass warn-
ings) could be enforced at other
campuses," Scarnecchia said.
Scarnecchia said she is propos-
ing is a clarification in language
to emphasize the University's
commitment to its policies on
freedom of speech and artistic
expression.
"We want to have, sort of
upfront and center in the policy,
the acknowledgement that we.

care about (these policies), and
the policy should be adminis-
tered in the context of those
other policies," Scarnecchia said.
It is unclear how the policy
proposals would affect about
2,000 people who have already
received trespass warnings at
the University's Ann Arbor cam-
pus. Asked if the policy changes
would be implemented retroac-
tively, Scarnecchia said she's not
sure whether the University
would be able to contact every-
one on the list to inform them of
a change to their trespass warn-
ings.
The proposed changes have 4
not yet been formally approved.
Scarnecchia said she wants to
collect input from the University
community before she discusses
the changes with the Ut versi-
ty's executive officers. As part of
this, Scarnecchia said she will be
meeting with several faculty and
student groups on campus, the
University's and state's chapters
of the ACLU and representatives
from University Police rn the
Flint and Dearborn campuses.
After the changes are final-
ized, Scarnecchia will submit the
final proposal to DPS for formal
adoption and implementation.
Scarnecchia said she hop's the
final proposals can be of cially
adopted by May.

The allure of classic film
Why old movies captivate us, and r
why that's not too cliche
By Will Defebaugh I Daily Arts Writer

Just what is it about old films
that is so appealing? "Casablan-
ca." "Breakfast at Tiffany's." "The
Sound of Music." These mov-
ies are all considered classics,
rewatched time and time again.
But why? What is it about these
films that makes us love them so,
that makes them qualify as our
favorites? And do we actually love
them, or is it just for show?
These questions, particularly
the last one, were on my mind
after I learned that the State The-
ater would be giving away cinema
memorabilia this past weekend,
ranging from old 35mm trailers to
posters from every film the State
has screened in the last five years.
I thought about going - really,
Idid. Butsomewhere between my
being sick Saturday morning and
the thought of an overwhelming
crowd of pretentious film buffs
fighting for a copy of a "Citizen
Kane" poster they would probably
never even put up made me want
to stay curled up in bed. Then the
idea occurred to me that it prob-
ably wouldn't even be a crowd of
pretentious film buffs, but just a
crowd of wannabe pretentious
film buffs. Or freshmen.
Needless to say, I decided to
nap instead. But as I was lying
there, trying to drift off into
unconsciousness, I couldn't help
but think about all of the mov-
ies that could be there. I thought
about "The Graduate" and "Gone
with the Wind." I had dreams
of "Dr. Strangelove" and "Blade
Runner." "To Kill a Mocking-

bird," "Shawshank Redemption."P
Would they be there? Should they
be there?
All these films have made a
huge impact on pop culture at
one point or another. People have
loved them, cried over them. But
there is something different about
people liking them now - people
who weren't around when they
first made their mark. You have to
ask yourself whether their inter-
est is genuine or just trendy.
After all, we live in a culture
that is Hollywood-obsessed. The
films we like say a lot about us.

America is cornered somewhat,
cast too frequently as a bum-

last legs. It tries desperately to
retain its power, and reveals just
how much moral fiber it has, or
lacks, in the process.
So, frankly, it's the perfect
time for a movie like "Battle: Los

$100 million budget about Aaron
Eckhart ("The Dark Knight")
commanding a group of Marines
against extraterrestrials as our

this war movie. The story of this

FAR EAST BEATS
Chinese rappers at the 'U'
Andreas Hwang discusses how hip hop
finds its way in Chinese society
By Lucy Perkins ( Daily Arts Writer

FINE ARTS COLUMN
Austen adapted

Each country has an icon that
represents its national identity to
the world. There's beer in Germa-
ny, there are pyramids in Egypt
and Panama has its canal. But
these associations can't and don't
encompass each country's culture
in its entirety. For example, China
has the Great Wall, but it also has
an extensive underground hip-
hop scene. Who knew?
On Friday, a student-organized
event sponsored by the Center for
Chinese Studies and the Confu-
cius Institute featured Chinese
rapper Young Kin, B-boy Fishball
from Hong Kong and DJ Rocklee
from Macau. Through perfor-
mances and showcases from these
Chinese-speakinghip-hop artists,
attendees had the opportunity
to experience this lesser-known
aspect of Chinese culture.
"Our main goal was to spread
awareness on campus that hip
hop in China exists," said LSA
senior Eric Couillard, who orga-
nized the event. "But at the same
time, we wanted people to learn
how hip hop is different in the
developing world versus in the
United States."
Andreas Hwang, who has taken
on the professional name Young
Kin, is one of China's most well
known rappers and was the fea-
tured speaker at the event. Born in
Switzerland, his parents moved to
Beijing when he was three months
old. When he was ten, Hwang saw
a group of kids rapping at school.
It was something he hadn't been
exposed to before, and he was
hooked immediately.
"They kind of impressed me,"
Hwang said in an interview with
The Michigan Daily. "I always
wanted to do something that
motivates people, like speaking
publicly or rapping."

In high school, Hwang began
writing his own lyrics, freestyling
and exploring the underground
hip-hop scene of Beijing for rap
battles. After he graduated, one of
the biggest hip-hop crews in Bei-
jing at the time, Yin Ts'ang, took
him. under its wing. The group
released mixtapes, one of which
included Hwang's first hit "Made
in China."
"I got a lot of attention for
that song and I started getting
approached by record labels like
Warner Music and Universal,"
Hwang said.
Even though Hwang was
beginning to be recognized as
one of the most popular rappers
in China, there was still a source
that continuously worked against
him and the other members of Yin
Ts'ang: the Chinese Ministry of
Culture.
"You end up feeling really
restricted as an artist," Hwang
said. "(The Ministry of Culture)
will have so many limitations on
what you can do that it inhibits
your growth."
Yin Ts'ang chose to ignore
The Ministry of Culture in order
to maintain its authenticity. The
group released most of its music
illegally online to express the
ideas that were important to its
members while escaping govern-
ment regulation.
"It's very frustrating. The only
way that hip-hop artists can stay
true to their culture and keep
their credibility is to do it all
underground," Hwang said. "If
you follow (The Ministry of Cul-
ture's) rules, hip hop isn't a true
form of self-expression. It's a
tricky game and we're up against
a very smart opponent."
According to Hwang, Yin
Ts'ang used rap to expose the

Young Kin from mainland China's first rap group, Yin Ts'ang, speaks last Friday.

people of China to new ideas and
opinions.
"Hip hop is an art form that is
very direct, soit's really useful for
hipping people to new slang and
concepts," Hwang said. "It's per-
fect for presenting ideas vocally
and showing how you feel the
country is changing."
Chinese hip-hop groups like
Yin Ts'ang may have exposed fol-
lowers to new concepts and ideas,
but their influence on areas out-
side the country will be slow at
best.
"We're just beginning to see
a wave of Chinese youth culture
spreading to other countries," said
Mary Gallagher, director of the
University's Center for Chinese
Studies. "It's just a matter of time,
though. China is still relatively
poor and developing - it's not able
to have a big cultural impact yet."
According to Gallagher, lan-
guage barriers may also be a fac-
tor slowing down China's cultural
influence.
"The culture is closely tied
with the language," she said. "If
you don't have the language abil-
ity, it's that much harder for the
culture tobe shared."

Couillard expressed similar
sentiments about the spread of
Chinese hip hop.
"It's not something that could
be exported at this point," Couil-
lard said. "At least right now, it's
not something that anyone out-
side of China could appreciate,
because it's so specialized."
Couillard pointed out that Chi-
nese hip hop often talks about
things that wouldn't necessarily
be popular in the U.S.
"One of the most popular hip-
hop songs in China is about some
guy cussing out his teacher,"
Couillard said. "It's not about the
song being good musically, but it's
just a cultural thing that everyone
there hates their teachers so they
can identify with it. But unless
you speak Chinese, it's impossible
for you to relate to that song."
But for those who can relate
to it, hip hop is a big part of the
underground Chinese culture,
and its presence has the power
to gain momentum in the future,
with dedication from artists like
Young Kin.
"The future can look really
good if we work hard," Hwang
said. "We can take this really far.?

I tis atruth universally
acknowledged, that any
adaptation of Jane Austen's
timeless classic "Pride and Prej-
udice" will be met with either
hostility or
obsession,
but will most

fanatic atten-
tion of Aus-
ten disciples.

Most
recently, "Pride and Prejudice"
entered my life through a staged
romantic comedy adaptation my
family saw over spring break
at the Cincinnati Shakespeare
Company. While I thoroughly
enjoyed parts of the show, I
thought it was miscast and the
characters reduced to annoying
shells of their most recognizable
traits. Elizabeth was confident
and witty, but ina "shut up, no
one wants to listen to you" way,
and Darcy was reserved and bit-
ter, but to the point of seeming
constipated.
Despite my criticism for the
adaptation, people seemed to
go gaga for it. Not only was the
show's run extended, but each
performance sold out - an
unprecedented event for such
a small theater with a niche
audience. This is the power of
"Pride and Prejudice" - even
a mediocre performance of the
beloved story can draw in more
people and revenue than Shake-
speare's greatest masterpieces.
How can this be? Why i. "Pride
and Prejudice" so prone to
adaptations that keep Austen's
fan base spellbound?
On the "Pride and Preju-
dice" Wikipedia page, there's
an entire section devoted to -
adaptations, ranging from the
2005 film with Kiera Knight-
ley as Elizabeth Bennet to
"Pride and Prejudice and
ombies" - the 2009 novel
that adds the living dead to the
social circle of 19th-century
England. Coin Firth stars in
both the classic six-hour BBC
made-for-TV miniseries and
the clever rom-com adaptation
"Bridget Jones's Diary." Dozens
of books start where Austen
left off, imagining the lives of
the beloved characters post-
last page, or telling the story
from Mr. Darcy's point of view.
Another BBC miniseries, "Lost
in Austen," features a modern
30-something (obsessed with
"Pride and Prejudice") who
finds a portal in her bathroom
directly leading her to the attic
in the Bennet house. She swaps
places with Elizabeth and
everything goes crazy. There is
also Sir Elton John's rumored
film adaptation "Pride and
Predator" which adds an alien
invasion to the rolling farmland
of Longbourne.
A sense of timelessness isn't
the only reason "Pride and
Prejudice" has stayed in the
public eye and creative mind
for all these years - the book
is also boundless. There seems
to be no tweak too bizarre for
the fans. You could place the
Bennet sisters at the bottom of
the sea, with shell bras and fish
fins, and I bet people would lap

it up. It's already been made
into a musical and a Bollywood
film, but where is the Disney
version, complete with talking
animals and an Alan Menken
soundtrack?
I'm sure that, for some, these
adaptations are blasphemous

taints on the holyground upon
which the sacred work of fiction
sits. Others may be amused by
these new spins, but uncompro-
misingly claim that the book
will always be better than any
variation. And for a lot of girls
in my high school, it was the
idea of a sexy, misunderstood
Mr. Darcy - played by either
the simultaneously regal and 4
adorable Firth or the much
rawer and emotional Matthew
Macfadyen - that kept the
pages turning and the obsession
ignited.
But the universally acknowl-
edged truth remains that if you
love "Pride and Prejudice," any
mention of it in a contemporary
context is going to set your
heart pounding. My grandma
and aunt have a theory: It's the
brilliance of Austen's writing,
her ability to make the inane
drama of an average fictional
family seem relatable to readers
- but also magically illusive -
that captures our attention and
that of the adapters who offer
their own spin on the Bennets.
Austen (probably not intention-
ally) balances between identi-
fiable characters and enough
wiggle room for adaptations to
be born.
As a self-proclaimed Austen
fan, I believe that my kind and 4
I swarm to adaptations because
they give us something new
to talk about, swoon over or
laugh at. The novel isn't novel
anymore - it was written over
200 years ago. Everything that
can be said about the original
has been said. The only nov-
elty comes with adaptations -
sometimes the more ridiculous,
the better.
From zombies
to Colin Firth,
'Pride' takes
many forms.
It's like Shakespeare. Con-
temporary casts are strivingto
find new lenses through which
to perform classics like "Ham-
let" or "Romeo and Juliet."
Like adaptations of "Pride and
Prejudice," these interpreta-
tions range from interesting
- like switching gender roles
- to ridiculous, like having the
characters bounce around on
jazzercise balls.
And, for me, the adaptations
of "Pride and Prejudice" repre-
sent something more important.
Jane Austen is abridge between
the generations of women in my
family. Maybe my grandmoth-
ers, aunts, and mother won't
appreciate "Pride and Prejudice
and Zombies" - which, as con-
noisseurs of the weird, my sister
and I find hilarious - but we
all went to see the somewhat-
biographic "Becoming Jane"
together in theaters and spent
quality time with each other.
While I can't begin to fully
understand why adaptations of 0
"Pride and Prejudice" continue
to captivate an audience that
changes with each passing gen-
eration, I can hope to be con-
tinually amused by adaptations

of "Pride and Prejudice" - I'm
looking at you Elton John - and
to keep sharing the Jane Austen
experience with my family.

Alexander starts out "A Million

West Region
as No. 8 seed
By BEN ESTES
Daily Sports Writer
Who could've predicted this?
Picked by everyone to finish at or near the bottom of the
Big Ten, playing with no seniors and with one of the young-
est squads in the country, the Michigan
men's basketball team has defied the OHIO STATE 68
odds this season. MICHIGAN 61
The Wolverines' surprising season
culminated on Sunday, when they were announced as a No.
8 seed in the NCAA Tournament. Michigan willl take on
Tennessee in the second round this Friday in Charlotte, N.C.
"It's huge," Michigan Athletic Director Dave Brandon said
yesterday. "It's huge for our program. I'm so proud of Coach
Beilein and his staff and these players. They've earned this,
and they've worked incredibly hard. I don't think anybody
gave us a snowball's chance in hell of being here."
The team gathered at Crisler Arena to watch the selection
show in front of a large gathering of fans.
CBS had a camera crew there to interview Michigan coach
John Beilein and get live shots of the team's and crowd's
reaction to its potential selection.
Beilein addressed the fans before the show began.
He preached about being pleased with the season no mat-
ter what the outcome of the selection show was.
It was a rather pessimistic take, considering most experts

returned from the

thing:
The Wolverines were going

nament.

certify her son's pipe dream.
"I thought you were stupid,"
she told him the other day, when
the two spoke on the phone.
"No one thought (we would
make it)," Novak admitted after
the Wolverines' Selection Show
gathering at Crisler Arena on
Sunday.
But the thingthat's different
about this team, the one thing
that no one could deny all season
- from the Wolverines' bevy of
devastating losses to its sweep
of Michigan State - is that this
team has heart.
That fact was never more obvi-
ous than when Michigan's name
was called in the No. 8 seed of the

West bracket.
The whole of Crisler Arena
burst likea maize and blue fire-
works show, as players leapt
out of their seats with the same
look of disbelief that most fans
wore all season. The team that
wouldn't win, couldn't win, had
won.
It's a theme that's been miss-
ing from Michigan sports the last
few years. It's somethingthat
you could see written all over
Novak's face as his grin went ear
to ear for the rest of the bracket
selection.
I've written plenty the last
year or so in this column about
how Michigan sports (read:
mostly football) have under-
achieved, missed out on oppor-
tunities and generally just not
carried themselves as Michigan
teams should.
I don't need to tell you that the
football team gave up at times
this year - the lack of execution
speaks for itself. And it took me
until last night, watchingthe
faces of a young, inexperienced
squad of Michigan athletes, to
understand why this basketball
team was so different from the
past three football teams.
This team has heart. And ahell
of a lot of it.
It also has a coach that its play-
ers and fans can trust, through

thick or thin.
"(This team) wasn't goingto
win on experience," Michigan
Athletic Director Dave Brandon
said as the pandemonium died
down inside Crisler Arena. "It
wasn't going to win because it
played an easy schedule in an
easy conference. This was all
about heart - and great coach-
ing."
Michigan sports teams are
supposed to have both of those
at all times. They're supposed to
overachieve, shock and intimi-
date - that's what makes the
alumni and fan network so vast
and the list of wins so long.
That's why underachieving
coaches get fired after three sea-
sons. That's why new coaches are
hired who can unite first and win
soon after.
It's awinning formula that has
been written in pen through all
the NCAA history books in maize
and blue.
You don't become the win-
ningest program in college foot-
ball history without that formula.
Or a softball powerhouse. Or an
Olympic swimming legend. Or
even the best water polo program
in the East.
It's what makes much of the
remainder of the country despise
Michigan fans. It's why the rest
of the country hated the Fab Five.

SOFTBALL
Blue drops first game of season,
goes 3-1 at Louisville Invitational

By MATT RUDNITSKY
Daily Sports Writer
LOUISVILLE, Ky. - Looking
up at the scoreboard after two
innings, the No. 6 Michigan soft-
ball team saw something it hadn't
seen in its first 24 games: the Wol-
verines were trailing at the end of
an inning.
Michigan fought back and
mounted a seventh-inning rally to
pull within one run, but the come-
back against Western Kentucky
on Sunday fell short, as the Hill-
toppers nabbed a 3-2 victory.
It was the Wolverines' first loss
of the season, capping off their
best start in history at 24-0.
Still, Michigan(25-1)wonthree
of its four games on the weekend
at the Louisville Invitational,
defeating both Western Kentucky
and Louisville in Saturday's dou-
bleheader, then the Cardinals
again on Sunday to recover from
its loss.
"This weekend was a very good
test for us," sophomore second
baseman Ashley Lane said. "Com-
ing back from spring break and
comingto play this tournament ...
it was a struggle.
"I'mnotgoingtolie,wewere all
tired, but we pushed through. We
made it count when we needed to,
and obviously we came up short
in the first game today, but we did
give it our all. It was definitely a
good test."
In the weekend's first game,
Louisville wasswithin striking dis-
tance as the game wound down.
Entering the top of the seventh,
Michigan was clinging to a 1-0
lead. But led by a two-RBI single
from senior first baseman Dorian

Shaw, the Wolverines put up three
runs on three hits, giving them a
4-0 lead.
Louisville finally put up a run
in the bottom of the seventh, but
it wasn't enough. The Cardinals
reached base 10 times - on nine
hits and one walk - but Michi-
gan senior pitcher Jordan Taylor
stayed calm under pressure, leav-
ing nine total runners on base.
After just 15 minutes of rest, the
Wolverines took on Western Ken-
tucky, dominating from the get-go
to earn a7-1 victory.
Michigan put up two runs in
the first and poured on five in the
second. The Hilltoppers decided
to walk the always-dangerous
Shaw to load the bases, but the
Wolverines made them pay,
knocking in all five runs after the
free pass.
Sophomore pitcher Stephanie
Speierman got the win, hurling
a complete game and carrying a
shutout into the sixth inning.
The next morning, the Wolver-
ines had the Hilltoppers nipping
at their heels. This time, Western
Kentucky seized control early and
never let up.
Hilltopper left-hander Mallorie
Sulaskie was magnificent, hold-
ing a Michigan team that averages
over seven runs per game to just
two runs on six hits.
Taylor pitched again for Michi-
gan, allowing Western Kentucky
to load the bases in the third
inning and ceded two runs. But
after that, Taylor went back to her
usual, unhittable form, but it was
too late.
Western Kentucky took a 2-0
lead into the sixth - extending it
to 3-0 in the seventh - and Michi-

gan couldn't get anything going at after she was the losing pitcher

By MATT SLOVIN
Daily Sports Writer
LOUISVILLE, Ky. - Short-
stop has been an unlucky posi-
tion this season for the No. 6
Michigan softball team.
First, junior Stephanie Kirk-
patrick underwent season-end-
ing knee surgery last week on a
recurring injury.,
Then, at the Louisville Soft-
ball Classic this weekend, a
screaming grounder took a nasty
bounce, clipping sophomore
Amy Knapp. Asked about the
status of Knapp's injury, Michi-
gan coach Carol Hutchins pro-
vided no comment.
Enter junior Amanda
Chidester, the Wolverines' jack-
of-all-trades. During Michigan's
weekend in the Bluegrass State,
she played three different posi-
tions, filling in wherever neces-
sary for any teammates ailing or
simply needing a rest.
With a batting average above
.400, Hutchins knows it's imper-
ative that 'Chiddy' remains
in the lineup, so she plugs
Chidester into different spots
on the field - catcher, third base
or shortstop - and is generally
pleased with the result.
Though Chidester's view
of the field may change dur-
ing a game, her mentality never
wavers.
"There's (multiple) positions
that I've played throughout my
entire life, so I just need to take
it for what it is and do my job,"
Chidester said.
And a loss against a medio-
cre Western Kentucky squad
over the weekend did nothing
to change that mentality. When
Michigan (25-1) travels to Cali-

fornia next weekend for the Judi
Garman Classic, the competition
will be the fiercest the Wolver-
ines have seen this season.
But for Hutchins, it's not so
much about the name on the
opponent's jersey as it is the
mentality of those in Maize and
Blue.
"We just need to compete,"
Hutchins said. "It's not about
the other teams."
Chidester knows there is no
one to blame after aloss - albeit
a rare one - but the team itself.
"We need to go out there with
a purpose every single time,"
Chidester said. "It's an eye-
opener for us."
"We need to go
out there with
a purpose every
single time."
Michigan may not be playing
with the same fire that it started
the season with, but Hutchins
won't tolerate any lackadaisical
efforts from her unit.
With No. 4 Arizona and No.
8 Arizona State awaiting this
weekend, the Wolverines will
have to return to that early-
season form if they want to have
success.
"As long as we're play-
ing together and we're doing
our part, our team is great,"
Chidester said. "When we tense
up ... we get down. But if we stay
positive and have alot of energy,
we'll be okay."

NO.8 SEED
From Page 1B
pegged the Wolverines as solidly
in the tournament after their
victory over Illinois in the Big
Ten Tournament quarterfinals
on Friday.
"I just have to always prepare
myself for (disappointment),"
Beilein said. "You just never
know what's going to happen.
I would have been very disap-
pointed (if we were left out)
- never shocked, but very dis-
appointed. But now that I see
where we were seeded, I don't
know what I was so worried
about."
Indeed, it appears that Michi-
gan would have been safely in
the field even if it had lost to the
Fighting Illini.
Beilein explained his team's
surprising seed by pointing to
the strength of the Big Ten -
seven conference squads made
the tournament - and the fact
that the Wolverines finished in
fourth place.

Two starting Buckeyes -
point guard Aaron Craft and
shooting guard David Lighty
had to sit most of the first half
after collecting two fouls early.
Then Jordan Sibert, who came
in as a result of the early foul
trouble, recorded two personals
as well.
Unlike the Wolverines, Ohio
State is not known for having
much depth to its roster. How-
ever, coach Thad Matta fina-
gled with the lineup, went into
halftime holding onto a 31-27
advantage and then was able to
play his starters in the second
stanza.
"We got them into a bit
'of trouble," Morgan said. "I
thought that maybe we could
use that to our advantage a little
more, but we didn't. In the sec-
ond half, I think all their starters
were in again."
And once the Buckeyes had
their starting five in the game,
L it seemed like they could do exe-
cute at ease on both the offen-
sive and defensive ends.
Ohio State shot 47 percent
from the field and collected
39 rebounds to Michigan's 33.
Sullinger tallied a game-high 13
rebounds to give the Buckeyes a
lot of second chances.
"That's also something we
can't let happen," Morgan said.

From Page 1B
James had four teammates
in Cleveland - it wasn't the
Cavaliers, because the "Chosen
One" worked alone. For him,
his chalk fell to the ground just
as easily as his opponents. And
when he left, Cleveland fell
apart.
And maybe that's what
people thought would happen
to Ann Arbor when Manny
Harris and DeShawn Sims left.
Maybe people thought their
dust would fog the air and the
remaining Wolverines would
crawl on hands and knees to the
exits. Maybe that's why student
ticket sales plummeted this
season.
But maybe people were too
focused on the names on the
backs of the jersey, rather than
the one on the front.
In the past 10 seasons, only
once has the Naismith College
Player of the Year, the award
that honors the top men's bas-
ketball player, been given to a
player partipating on the team
that won the National Champi-
onship.
Ever since a team meeting
after the Wolverines' 69-64 loss
to Minnesota on Jan. 22, Michi-
gan has been playing with a dif-
ferent mentality on the court.
"I watched that film and was
really disgusted with myself, I
knew I needed to step up. Not
just in terms of my on-the-court
performance, but just being a
better teammate," Morris said
at the time. "Afterward, I called
a team meeting and I apolo-
gized to everybody and every-
body else stepped up too and
said they've been lacking too
at being a good teammate and
holding each other accountable
to go out there and playing hard
all the time."
Morris and junior captains
Stu Douglass and Zack Novak
have pulled this team together
into a single cohesive unit. They
don't care about who scores.
They leave the statistics to the
statisticians.
But not every group of play-
ers in the country can say that.
With just under six minutes
left in Michigan's Big Ten Tour-
nament semifinal game against
Ohio State, a Morris layup
was blocked by the 6-foot-8,
255-pound Dallas Lauderdale.
When Lauderdale returned to
earth, he was holding up two
fingers.
That didn't signify how many
points the Buckeyes withheld
from the Wolverines that pos-
session.
It was the number of blocks
Lauderdale had that game.
Michigan was about to go on
a run, and Ohio State's senior
leader was bragging about his
stats.
But when Hardaway Jr. hits
a big shot, he doesn't count how
many he's hit. He doesn't let
life skills and financial literacy to
find success, whether it's on the
court or off it.
But either way, he'll urge the
students to confront life issues
the same way he and the rest of
the Fab Five did it - face-to-face,

ketball. The film details every-
thing that's been under wraps
since the early 1990s, from the
individuals - how they got from
the inner-city to Ann Arbor - to
their revolutionizing hip-hop
swag, to the massive payment
scandal involving Webber that
ultimately led to their deletion
from the record books.
"First and foremost, (we want
to show) that we were college
*-kids," Rose said after a private
screening on Friday. "So there
were things that we did that were
responsible, there were things
we did that were stupid. There
were times when we were able to
articulate ourselves, there were
times when we were ignorant and
immature. That was part of the
college experience."
And within, the movie presents
a pungent critique of amateurism
in a sport where the NCAA and
athletic departments take mil-
lions to the bank on the successes
of unpaid athletes.
The only significant figure
notably absent from the film,
however, is Webber himself, and
for fairly obvious reasons. Not
only did his relationship with
University booster Ed Martin
and subsequent dishonesty with a
grand jury tarnish the Michigan
basketball program, but his infa-
mous timeout call when there
were no timeouts left at the end
of the 1993 National Champion-
ship game against North Carolina


is still a sore subject.
Both events were discussed
extensively in the film.
"The elephant in the room, as
you saw in the film, is that Chris
chose not to give a 2011 inter-
view," Rose said after the screen-
ing. "But hopefully he'll find that
salvation in this life, like he could
bring some sort of closure to it.
Like I told him, I wish all I had
to say is that I called a timeout.
You think I want to be sitting
there with my grandmother or
son talking about me being in the
crack house? No I don't want to
talk about that, man. That's what
I told him."
Rose was referringto a pointin
his sophomore year, when he was
caught playing video games at
his friend's house during a drug
bust. But in addressing the issue,
he mentions that he was not in a
crack house - because he knows
from home what a real dope
house is.
Indeed, Friday's screening
at the Detroit Science Center in
front of mostly just Rose's friends
and family was personal for him.
Through every moment of his
career, he's brought a piece of the
Motor City with him.
And now, he's giving back.
The end of the movie briefly
mentions his plans to open the
Jalen Rose Leadership Academy,
a charter high school that will
find its home in the heart of the
city.
"For some of these kids, it's like
Beirut to finally get to school,"
Rose said after the screening.
"Your uncle's on crack, you've

Leave your
mark, class of
2011, and get
an NCAA title

BIS

One of the largest incom-
ing classes in Michigan
hockey history came to
Ann Arbor four years ago.
Twelve freshmen became Wol-
verines back in the fall of 2007,
and since then, the class size has
dwindled to just seven.
Following
the class's
first year, it
saw the early
exit of power
forward Max:
Pacioretty to
the Hamilton
Bulldogs, the' MARK
minor league BURNS
affiliate of
the Montreal
Canadians. After its second sea-
son, Aaron Palushaj left Michigan
and is still toiling around in the
American Hockey League (maybe
that wasn't the best choice, eh?).
The Wolverines also said, "Bye,
bye," to Kevin Quick and Tris-
tin Llewellyn for violating team
expectations.
After all of that, the seven
still standing (senior netminder
Shawn Hunwick is projected
to return for a fifth year) have
"I can't tell you
I'm happy with
the legacy or the
program."
won practically everything: two
CCHA regular-season titles, two
conference tournament champi-
onships and three Great Lakes
Invitational titles. It's been to the
NCAA Tourney all four years, but
the Frozen Four only once.
With that being said, it's time
for this senior class to leave its
mark at Michigan and check the
one box that has eluded this pro-
gram for over a decade: an NCAA
title.
And the run to St. Paul, Minn.
begins next Friday in the CCHA
Tournament semifinals.
The Wolverines have won
games this year in every imagin-
able way, which is certainly key
come playoff time and especially
in the NCAAs.
They have shellacked teams
like Michigan State with a 5-0
win in The Big Chill at the Big
House in front of a world-record
crowd. Hunwick stole the show
on a few occasions - just ask-

Alaska and New Hampshire about
the netminder.
The Nanooks fired 76 shots on
Hunwick in a two-game series
back in January, and the Sterling
Heights, Mich. native stopped all
but three to preserve the sweep.
Against the Wildcats, he stopped
45 of 48 shots in a 3-3 tie during
mid-October.
Not to mention, Michigan won
10 of its 25 contests by just one
goal.
The list goes on and on about
the ways in which this team won
hockey games this season.
This past weekend against
Bowling Green - in the class's
final game at Yost Ice Arena -
was a perfect example.
In Saturday night's 4-1 win,
three sophomores tallied lamp-
lighters, with defenseman Lee
Moffie notching two goals in the
process.
Michigan's three leading scor-
ers who were actually in the
lineup - Carl Hagelin, Matt Rust
and Chris Brown - didn't register
a single point.
The Wolverines dominated an
inferior team up-and-down the
ice all night long - they sent the
Falcons back to that state down
south and propelled themselves
to Joe Louis Arena once again.
So here we are.
It's mid-March and Michigan
is back at the Joe contending
for another CCHA Tournament
championship.
Wouldn't it be nice, though, if
Wolverine nation was cheering
for an NCAA title contender this
year?
Don't worry, it is.
"I can't tell you if I'm happy
with the legacy or the program,"
Michigan coach Red Berenson
said to FoxSportsDetroit in an
article last week. "I don't think
we've done as well as we should
have."
But this class has done as well
as it "should have" - almost.
When Michigan grabs a No. 1
or No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tour-
nament in two weeks, there won't
be lofty expectations that can't be
reached.
There's just going to be one
slight dilemma.
Will the seven members of 2011
become a memorable class by
bringing home the program's 10th
title, or will they become a class
lost in the memory of a program
that has fallen short on other
occasions on the biggest stage?
We'll find out soon enough.

week-
end, the BOWLING GREEN 1
any- MICHIGAN 4
thing
wasg expected.,
INegrly everything went as
planned for the No. 5 Michigan
hockey team in its CCHA quar-
terfinal series.
The Wolverines swept Bowl-
ing Green by rattling off a 5-1
win on Friday and a 4-1 win on
Saturday like they were check-
ing items off their shopping list.
The next item on the list:
the Mason Cup, awarded to the
winner of the CCHA Tourna-
ment.
"We're a confident team,"
sophomore defenseman Lee
Moffie said. "We came into this
weekend wanting two wins,
and anything short of that
would have been disappointing.
We came here and got the two

wins.
"We were confident in that
happening, and we made it hap-
pen."
The Falcons are living proof,
of the unpredictable nature of
the playoffs; they were the last
seed in the conference tourna-
ment, winning just three games
in the CCHA all year.
They then beat No. 6 seed
Northern Michigan in the first
round.
Friday's game started with
Bowling Green believing they
could do it again.
Early in the game, the Wol-
verines blocked a shot, and the
rebound bounced to a Falcon
in the slot. With senior goalie
Shawn Hunwick on the other
side of the net, freshman for-
ward Luke Moffatt tied up the
stick and left the game score-
less.
"They're playing a smart
game, and they're looking to
create turnovers and they did
get one," Michigan coach Red
Berenson said after Friday's
game. "They got a good chance
on it. They can score goals....
They scored enough goals last
weekend."

That would be the best
chance the Falcons would have
for the first two periods. Michi-
gan woke up, scoring two goals
in the first and added another
in the second - senior forward
Scooter Vaughan's toe-drag-to-
top-shelf highlight reel goal -
to put the Wolverines up three
and the game out of reach.
Bowling Green had scored
three goals just one time in
their last 17 games.
It was more of the same Sat-
urday, wiAt Michigan using the
first two periods to reach the
magical three-goal mark in the
second period.
This time it was Moffie's see-
ing-eye wrist shot from the left
point that squeaked through
Falcon goalie Andrew Ham-
mond late in the second period
that put the game away.
"It was just a decent release,
and I don't think he was ready
for it," Moffie said. "He prob-
ably should have made the save,
but luckily it went in."
Perhaps the only thing Mich-
igan didp't check off the to-do
list wasstay healthy.
Late in the third period of
Friday's game, junior forward

David Wohlberg was sand-
wiched by two Falcon play-
ers - according to Berenson,
Wohlberg broke his collarbone
on the play, and he will miss the
rest of the season.
Senior forward Ben Winnett
filled in for Wohlberg on the top
line.
The offense didn't slow
down. A day after outshooting
Bowling Green 41-24, the Wol-
verines had 15 more shots than
the Falcons in game two.
The plus-32, shot differen-
tial on the weekend is the big-
gest difference Michigan has
recorded all season.
"It's a tough series when
you're playing against a last
-place team," Berenson said.
"Sometimes you might think
you can take liberties; or you
can take shortcuts. Well, there's
no way."
Friday will be Michigan's
next opportunity to round out
their shopping list as it will face
No. 4 seed Western Michigan
in the semifinals, and the finals
will be on Saturday. As the top
seed, the Wolverines are the
obvious favorite.
But you know what they say.

Sophomores pace 'M' offensive attack

'QUICK HITS' WITH
BRANDON BURLON

By CASANDRA PAGNI
Daily Sports Writer
Following a season-ending
collarbone injury to the Wol-
verines' second-leading scorer,
junior forward David Wohlberg,
in game one of the best-of-
three CCHA quarterfinal series
against Bowling Green on Fri-
day, the Michigan bench was
depleted on Saturday, to say the
least.
In fact, freshman defenseman
Kevin Clare was the only healthy
game-time scratch for the Wol-
verines..
In losing Wohlberg and senior
forward Louie Caporusso - who
suffered alower-body injury two
weekends ago against Northern
Michigan - the fifth-ranked
Wolverines lost leadership and
two top-tier forwards.
But in the seniors' last series
in Yost.Ice Arena - a 5-1 Friday
victory and a 4-1 win on Satur-
day it was the sophomores
who shined.
"Obviously, when guys go
down, all the guys have to step
up," senior forward Carl Hage-
lin said after Saturday's win.
"Today, (sophomore defenseman
Lee Moffie) stepped up with a
great game, great performance,
two goals and one assist. (Sopho-
more forward Lindsay Sparks)
had a really good game as well
and so did (sophomore forward
A.J. Treais). That is what you
need and those guys are ready
to play. They're obviously very

skilled guys and they showed up
today."
Sparks, who has had a consis-
tent spot in the lineup since the
series in Marquette, sawhis hard
work pay off in both games this
past weekend.
Sparks scored his first goal of
the series just 42 seconds into
the third period against the Fal-
cons on Friday. Michigan was
up 3-0 on Bowling Green, but
Sparks's goal set the tempo for
a dominant third period for the
Wolverines.
"I'm glad (Sparks) scored a
goal," Berenson said on Friday.
"Lindsay had a chance to have a
real good game, and I can't tell
you he didn't have a good game,
but he misfired on one of his best
chances. You'd like to see him
finish that one. But neverthe-
less he's playing, getting some
experience, hopefully some con-
fidence."
Sparks flashed that confidence
on Saturday, scoring Michigan's
second goal of the game six min-
utes into the second period. He
took a cross-ice pass from fresh-
man defenseman Mac Bennett,
beat the Falcon defenders and
buried the puck for his third tally
of his sophomore season.
Treais, the center on Sparks's
line, scored the Wolverines' sec-
ond power-play goal of the game
on Saturday.
While senior forward Ben
Winnett played with Treais and
Sparks on Friday, freshman for-
ward Luke Moffatt joined the
