In November 2015, while 

other students were focusing on 
midterms, football games and 
the fast-approaching Michigan 
winter, then-LSA senior Zachary 
Ackerman had something else 
on his mind. He was running for 
Ann Arbor City Council.

“I grew up in Ann Arbor and 

grew up as a pretty nerdy kid. 
When I was 15 and a student 
at Pioneer High School, that 
nerdiness 
channeled 
itself 

into an interest in politics and 
government. 
Figuring 
local 

government 
was 
the 
most 

approachable, I started attending 
City 
Council 
meetings,” 

Ackerman wrote in an email 
interview. “By early 2015, I had 
grown pretty unhappy with my 
representation on City Council 
and went out to find an alternative 
candidate. 
Unfortunately, 
I 

couldn’t find one, so I threw my 
hat in the ring instead.”

He was not the first person to 

run for or sit on City Council as 
a student, but his involvement 
in local politics is certainly not 
the current norm for University 
of Michigan students. When 
Ackerman ran in 2015, The Daily 
reported a voter turnout of 0.81 
percent of those registered in 
Ward 1’s first and second precinct 
and a voter turnout of 1.15 percent 
for Ward 4’s first precinct — all 
student-heavy areas. At Palmer 
Commons that year, a total of 
seven ballots were cast.

Ann Arbor has over 117,000 

residents, but the University has 
over 44,000 students. Students 
make up a sizeable portion of 
the city, and many issues in town 
directly affect them. So why 
aren’t they voting?

“Students were obviously a 

very big part of that” 

Low voter turnout among 

students is nothing new, nor is it 
unique to the University.

According to the Center for 

Information and Research on 

Civic Learning and Engagement 
at Tufts University, voter turnout 
at universities across the country 
in 2014 was just 19 percent. 
People under 30 voted at a rate 
of only 21 percent. The rest of the 
nation had a much higher turnout 
rate of 36 percent.

As director of the Campus 

Vote Project, an arm of the 
Fair Elections Legal Network, 
Michael Burns is hoping to 
change that reality.

Business 
junior 
Matthew 

Mansour was granted a personal 
protection order against his 
roommate, 
Business 
senior 

Abhishek McFarland, based on 
a tense living environment in 
which Mansour was too afraid 
to come back to his apartment at 
Landmark Apartments on South 
University Avenue. McFarland 
will have to move out of the 
apartment with police present.

The terms of the PPO also 

mandate 
McFarland 
cannot 

have any contact with Mansour. 
While 
McFarland’s 
attorney 

pointed out the two were in the 
same school and possibly the 
same apartment, Washtenaw 
County judge Patrick J. Conlin 
said McFarland should take 
the effort to avoid him and 
that Mansour should not go to 
the police if he simply passes 
McFarland in the apartment.

Close to 40 students packed 

the Washtenaw County Trial 
Court 
Thursday 
afternoon 

to 
support 
Mansour, 
who 

claimed in a viral Facebook 
post yesterday evening he was 
targeted for being a gay man.

While McFarland’s attorney 

argued it was an eviction 
situation to be kept at a 
Landmark level and Mansour 
sought a PPO for his own 
convenience, 
Conlin 
ruled 

the environment was hostile 
enough to grant the order. 
Conlin expressed disbelief at 
the McFarland’s stories and said 
his witness recount involved 
too many people and was too 
inconsistent. 

The case is also currently 

an open investigation with the 
Ann Arbor Police Department. 
AAPD detective Jessica Oliverio 
testified Thursday, but did not 
have many details to add to the 
case. 

Mansour 
said 
while 
he 

was out on Fall Break, his 
friend Michelle Vander Lugt, 
Engineering senior, went to 
borrow groceries from him 
when she noticed all his kitchen 
utensils and dog toys — later 
estimated to be $600 in worth 
— were missing. Additionally, 
she said the roommate who 
opened the door for her warned 
her she might not find anything. 
She then took pictures of knife 
marks 
on 
Mansour’s 
door, 

a 
damaged 
doorknob 
and 

windowsill. Mansour said the 
environment felt more life-
threatening after he came out 
on National Coming Out Day 
earlier this month.

Mansour 
previously 

petitioned the Office of Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion on the 
basis of sexual discrimination. 
Conlin, however, said he did 
not see evidence of anti-gay 
behavior strictly by McFarland, 
but agreed there have been too 
many incidents that targeted 
Mansour.

Mansour testified Landmark 

randomly assigned Mansour 
to 
McFarland’s 
apartment 

with two roommates. Mansour 
owned a service dog for his 
anxiety, to which McFarland 
reacted harshly on the first 
day and continued to call him 
expletives. 

During his time living with 

his roommates this semester, 
Mansour argued McFarland 
created a toxic environment, 
cheering on a roommate to 
urinate in his dog’s bowl and 
throwing his property out the 
window. He said the roommates 
were also stealing exit signs, 
and when Mansour brought this 
up to Landmark authorities, he 
said McFarland called him a 
“bitch” several times. He then 
said he banged on the wall while 
Mansour was in his bedroom, 
saying “All gays go to hell.”

In his statement to the 

court, McFarland said he was 
frustrated with the situation 
and admitted to swearing at 
Mansour once. He said he 
was allergic to dogs and did 
not realize the service animal 
was hypoallergenic. However, 
Conlin 
said 
McFarland’s 

frustrations with living with a 
dog were targeted at Mansour 
rather than brought up to 
Landmark.

Mansour played a recording 

of a male voice saying the 
expletives 
to 
the 
court. 

McFarland countered the voice 
belonged to his friend.

When McFarland came to 

the stand, he insisted he would 
be happy to welcome Mansour 
back. While he admitted to the 
other roommate urinating in 
his dog’s bowl, he said he did 
not urge neither did he say the 
anti-gay slurs. He insisted it 
was another friend. McFarland 
also said the knife marks on the 
door was because of another 
friend during the weekend of 
the University versus Michigan 
State football game, not Fall 
Break.

McFarland and Mansour’s 

roommate came as another 
witness on McFarland’s behalf. 
As he approached the stand, the 
witness’s gait was wavering and 
speech slurred, prompting the 
judge to ask him if he was under 
the influence. The roommate 
replied he was not.

The 
witness’s 
story 

conflicted 
with 
Mansour’s 

Former state Sen. Gretchen 

Whitmer spoke to students and 
answered their questions during 
an event at the University of 
Michigan on Thursday night at an 
event sponsored by the University’s 
chapter of College Democrats.

In January, Whitmer declared 

her 
candidacy 
for 
governor, 

following 14 years in Michigan 
legislature. 
She 
previously 

served in the Michigan House 
of Representatives and in the 
Michigan Senate. Whitmer spoke 
briefly about why she decided to 
run, reminiscing on the state she 
knew when she was growing up 
and what she hopes to rebuild. 
Some of her areas of concern are 
public education, repealing the 
emergency 
manager 
law 
and 

getting rid of gerrymandering in 
the state of Michigan.

“And right now I look around at

agenda by the way,” Whitmer said.

Campus-wide DEI survey finds majority of student body satisfied with diversity climate

One in five students at the 

University of Michigan — and 43.8 
percent of all underrepresented 
minority 
undergraduates, 

defined as non-white and non-
Asian — reported experiencing a 

discriminatory event in the last 
year.

These metrics and more were 

released Thursday afternoon in 
results of a campus-wide climate 
survey on diversity, equity and 
inclusion.

While a majority of campus 

–– 72 percent of students, faculty 
and staff –– reported overall 

satisfaction 
with 
the 
campus 

climate with respect to diversity, 
minority students are much more 
likely to feel dissatisfied and 
experience discrimination.

34.8 percent of Asian students 

and 7.5 percent of white students 
said 
they 
had 
experienced 

racial 
discrimination. 
Among 

undergraduates, 
37.1 
percent 

of 
women, 
29.3 
percent 
of 

LGBTQ students, 28.1 percent 
of 
international 
students 
and 

47.7 percent of disabled students 
reported experiencing at least one 
incident of discrimination in the 
past 12 months.

for equity and inclusion, said the

Every Friday, The Michigan Daily 
republishes an article from The 
Daily’s archives from a moment in 
University history. 

December 16,1956 
— Winter 

has the dubious distinction of 
being the leading season for gripes 
and complaints about the ever 
popular subject of weather. 

Days are short, walking and 

driving are often treacherous and 
the wind is sharp and biting. For 
some it is a convenient time to 
count the days until spring and 
vow fervently to “go south next 
year and stay there.”

But for others all is not lost. 

The snow covering the ground 
offers vast opportunities for fun 
and frolic. Racing down snow 
covered slopes is exhilarating 
to mind and body. The dangers 
add a challenge to the skills of 
the skier. Tobogganing and ice 
skating provide hours of fun for 
the enterprising sportsman. 

The snow, a frustrating 

enemy if one is in a hurry, is also 
a picturesque thing of beauty. 
Even those who long for summer 
appreciate the impressive views of 
landscapes and buildings covered 
with a clean, fresh blanket of 
snow. 

Snow covered porch rails, 

broken down fences and the 
barren limbs of trees become the 
subjects for camera lovers and the 
old, fondly recalling happy winter 
days of their youth. 

For the young and the young at 

heart, it is a time for the creation 
of all sorts of things in snow. The 
children build the ever-popular 
snowman with the pipe in his 
mouth and of course the “fort” for 
an exciting snow-ball fight. 

College students hold winter 

carnivals and build everything 
from ships to houses, all from 
snow. Contests and parties are 
held in the atmosphere of the 

stimulating vigor of winter. 

For the winter-lover it is a time 

of crisp, cold air and rigorous 
outdoor life. For one and all it is a 

time of beauty as only nature can 
create beauty.

primary utility of the survey was 
to target further Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion plan efforts.

The 
questionnaire 
sought 

demographic information such 
as sexual orientation, disability 
status and racial or ethnic identity 
— including a category for Middle 
Eastern or North African students. 
The group has not been tracked at 
the University in the past; the DEI 
survey found the group makes up 
less than 4 percent of the student 
body. 

“(The 
survey) 
also 
allows 

us to effectively look at certain 
populations 
separately 
from 

other populations, recognizing 
the nuance with respect to 
experiences,” 
Sellers 
said. 

“Historically, (MENA students) 
have … been forced to either 
identify as ‘White’ or ‘other.’ By 
being able to include them in the 
survey, we have a more accurate 
assessment of, first and foremost, 
how many folks are actually here, 
and then to be able to look at their 
experiences separately. That also 
reaffirms our sense that they are 
an important community in and of 
themselves.” 

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel noted the data was 
collected during Fall Semester 
last year –– before many of the 
recent incidents of racism and hate 
speech that are now the focus of 
student action.

“Whatever the context was in 

people’s minds last fall was the 
context in which they answered 
those questions,” Schlissel said at 
the announcement of the survey 
results in the Michigan Union.

The survey designed by the 

Office of Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion 
received 
responses 

from 2,065 students, 2,583 staff 
members 
and 
1,061 
faculty 

members, at response rates of 59 
percent, 73.8 percent and 70.7 
percent, respectively.

Responding to the 7.5 percent of 

white undergraduates reporting 
racial 
discrimination, 
William 

Axinn, 
professor 
of 
survey 

research, said he encountered 
surprises like this in almost all the 
surveys he has conducted.

“My 
experience 
conducting 

surveys on all topics, and with 
this topic, is you discover the full 
diversity of what’s out there when 
you take a survey that samples 
from the general population in a 
scientific way, you will discover 
people with experiences and 

opinions you might not have 
expected ahead of time,” he said. 
“I am no longer ever surprised 
to find a percentage, often a 
small percentage, who have an 
experience you’re not expecting 
to see.”

The most commonly reported 

reason for discrimination among 
all 
students, 
undergrad 
and 

grad, was political orientation, 
which accounted for 21 percent 
of the reports of discrimination, 
followed by race and gender at 20 
percent each. 

Sellers said he wasn’t expecting 

so many students to report 
discrimination based on their 
political orientation.

“One of the things that was 

surprising was the finding that 
undergraduate students, a high 
number of them report relatively 
fewer opportunities to interact 
across 
political 
orientation 

and 
higher 
frequencies 
of 

discrimination around political 
orientation than I personally 
would have predicted,” he said.

As a result, Sellers said, the 

University 
is 
organizing 
and 

hosting a series of symposia 
centered 
around 
free 
speech 

during 
the 
winter 
semester, 

focusing specifically on differences 
in political backgrounds. Other 
action items more broadly include a 
streamlined bias response process 
— with boosted student awareness 
— the Inclusive Teaching Initiative 
and incorporating DEI efforts into 
faculty and staff performance 
reviews.

The survey also included data 

on the disabled community on 
campus. Making up 5 percent of 
the student body, students with 
a disability are 287 percent more 
likely to experience discrimination 
and 145 percent more likely to 
report feeling neutral, unsatisfied 
or very unsatisfied with the 
University. The words “disability” 
and “disabilities” are mentioned 
a total of five times in the 40-plus 
page campuswide strategic plan.

Sellers 
pointed 
to 
other 

programs, such as the Inclusive 
Teaching Initiative, that implicitly 
cater to disabled students.

“Nowhere in that initiative as 

it’s described is it described as a 
disability-focused initiative, but 
the benefits will be accrued by 
students with disabilities,” he said.

and McFarland’s accounts — 
according to the roommate, no 
one had ever insulted Mansour 
despite 
McFarland 
admitting 

to having called Mansour the 
expletive. He also said he never 
heard a friend say the anti-gay 
chants, 
despite 
McFarland’s 

insisting another friend said 
the slurs. The roommate did, 
however, admit to urinating in 
Mansour’s dog’s bowl.

The witness also said the 

incidents in which the door was 
knifed — also insisting it was 
the night before the Michigan 
State game — were caused by 
a friend from New York that 
had a schizophrenic episode 
after drinking and going off his 
medication.

On 
the 
conflicting 
dates, 

Conlin said he could not see a 
beneficial reason for Mansour to 
lie. He also said he plausibly could 
not see how many people could 
be involved and for the witness’s 
friend to have that burst of energy 
after being intoxicated since the 
afternoon. 

Business junior Serena Brown 

attended the hearing in support 
of Mansour.

“(My friends and I) are in the 

same section as Matthew,” she 
said. “I came to show support to 
someone who is really sweet.”

Mansour later told the Daily he 

was relieved by the verdict.

“I am glad that I am able to 

move back into my apartment, go 
back to my bed,” he said. “(I am 
sad) that there were lies made in 
the court today but the judge saw 
through that pretty clearly and I 
am glad that he gave me the PPO.”

Arnold Reed, who is the father 

of LSA senior Arlyn Reed, one 
of Mansour’s friends, said he 
has known Mansour for many 
years and never known him to 
participate in unruly behavior.

“We are very, very happy,” 

he said. “(Mansour) is a good, 
nice kid ... I am not happy for 
(McFarland) ... but he has to come 
to justice and understanding.”

“One of the things (the Fair 

Elections 
Legal 
Network) 

noticed in trying to help remove 
these barriers to registration 
for 
voting 
for 
underserved 

populations was that students 
were obviously a very big part 
of that,” Burns said. “Back in 
2012 we started the Campus 
Vote Project to have the biggest 
impact on that.”

The Campus Vote Project 

aims to address the issue by 
focusing on voter registration, 
voter 
education 
and 
voter 

turnout efforts all in a non-
partisan or politically-neutral 
way. Last year, the organization 
started a program to train 
colleges to increase these efforts. 
According to Burns, they took 
about 100 statements of interest 
from campuses that wanted 
to participate and ran those 
schools through an educational 
program on how to get students 
to register and turn out to vote.

This year, after reviewing 

feedback and looking at the 
progress each campus made, the 
Campus Vote Project gave the 
designation of ‘Voter Friendly 
Campus’ to 83 institutions. The 
University of Michigan is not 
included on this list.

“We’re 
below 
average, 

Michigan is right now” 

It’s not just local elections 

that 
are 
forgotten 
at 
the 

University. Turnout numbers for 
the 2016 presidential election, 
while 
significantly 
higher, 

were still low among students. 
According 
to 
the 
National 

Study of Learning, Voting and 
Engagement report, only 44.7 
percent 
of 
the 
University’s 

students voted last fall, and only 
68.2 percent were registered.

Professor Edie Goldenberg, a 

former dean of LSA and director 
of the Ford School of Public 
Policy, said she is concerned 
about these figures. At a plenary 
session of the Michigan Political 
Science Association last week, 
she participated in a panel 
of students and faculty from 
schools all over the state on the 
topic of how to increase student 
voting.

“Both 
Oakland 
University 

and Wayne State University 
have higher voter turnout rates 
than University of Michigan and 
Michigan State,” Goldenberg 
said. “It’s our hope that we can 
make our numbers improve and 
become more respectable. We’re 
below average, Michigan is right 
now, based upon our 2016, our 
2014, and our 2012 numbers 
… for large public universities. 
And Michigan doesn’t like to be 
below average in anything.”

This 
low 
turnout 
might 

not be entirely students’ fault. 
According 
to 
Goldenberg, 

Michigan’s 
voting 
laws 
are 

unfriendly compared to other 
states’. Michigan is classified 
by voting advocacy group Rock 
the Vote as a “blocker,” the 
category of states that make it 
most difficult for their residents 
to vote. Michigan doesn’t have 

same-day registration, online 
registration — all things that 
make it easier for people, and 
especially students, to vote.

“Obviously it’s not the only 

reason, because Wayne State 
and Oakland did it, and they’re 
in Michigan also,” Goldenberg 
said. “The Wayne State Student 
Government is very active; our 
student government has been 
very active. But we’re all working 
together now on this Big 10 
Voting challenge, and I think 
that Michigan will do much 
better going forward because we 
have support from the President 
on down, really.”

The Big 10 Voting Challenge, 

an initiative started by University 
President Mark Schlissel, has 
turned voter turnout into a 
competition among the fourteen 
schools in the Big 10 Conference. 
The winner will be determined 
based on which school has the 
highest turnout rate in the 2018 
midterm elections.

This is just one way the 

University is working to change 
the voting narrative on campus. 
Goldenberg is also working 
with a group of about forty 
students and faculty on the Turn 
Up Turnout initiative, which 
partners with TurboVote to get 
students registered quickly and 
runs workshops for college and 
high school students to promote 
voter education, and also puts a 
tab for registration on Wolverine 
Access.

“We set up tables at every 

orientation session this summer 
for new students and we helped 
them access TurboVote and 
get signed up,” she said. “This 
means that in the mail, they’ll 
receive a voter registration card 
that is partially filled out, along 
with a stamped envelope. It also 
will provide them with election 
reminders (for wherever they 
register). We helped provide 
access to about 15,000 students 
this summer, and we’ve been 
looking for opportunities to 
table since then.”

One of the things Goldenberg 

and the Turn Up Turnout team 
have discovered is that certain 
groups of students are more 
likely to vote than others. STEM 
students, for example, vote at 
an even lower rate than that of 
the entire University. Music, 
Theatre & Dance junior David 
Kamper, 
a 
science 
student 

himself, is working with Turn 
Up Turnout and science policy 
organization 
314Action 
to 

develop programs that will 
directly target the University’s 
students in the sciences to show 
them how important their vote 
is.

“Science students are among 

the worst student voter turnout, 
just due to classes and the 
questions about applicability,” 
Kamper said. “One of our 
initiatives we’re gonna really 
hit hard come January 2018 is 
‘From Lab to Booth,’ where we 
get scientists in the community 
and scientists in the University 
to get out of the lab and back into 
the voting booth.”

Kamper is still registered 

to vote at home in Minnesota, 

but plans on changing his 
registration to Ann Arbor for 
next year’s midterm elections.

“Voting and understanding 

issues goes completely beyond 
just voting for president every 
four years.” 

Even with the increased rates 

of registration Goldenberg and 
her team are trying to promote, 
many students like Kamper are 
choosing to register in their 
hometowns. This only furthers 
the lack of student involvement 
in Ann Arbor politics.

Proving this point, Enrique 

Zalamea, an LSA senior and 
president of the University’s 
chapter of College Republicans, 
is registered in New Jersey. He 
said, though, his organization 
has done work for local elections 
in the past. While they are 
not campaigning for any City 
Council candidates this year 
(there are no Republicans on 
the ballot), they have canvassed 
for 
gubernatorial 
candidates 

and state Senate candidates. 
Zalamea thinks part of the 
reason students are so inactive 
when it comes to local elections 
is because local officials aren’t 
reaching out to them.

“I suppose you can take a 

look at it in terms of the lack of 
inaction from college students 
in local level politics might be 
because people from that level 
don’t reach out to us,” Zalamea 
said. “The Colbeck for Governor 
campaign reached out to us … 
If anyone from the local City 
Council wanted to come speak 
to us, then we’d be more than 
happy to, if they wanted us to 
volunteer for us or canvass, we’d 
be more than happy to do that as 
well. It’s been kind of silent on 
their part.”

Public Policy senior Rowan 

Conybeare, 
chair 
of 
the 

University’s chapter of College 
Democrats, is also registered 
to vote elsewhere. She said her 
group has also not officially 
helped 
with 
any 
Council 

campaigns this year, though 
they have been contacted about 
supporting ballot initiatives.

“We have been reached out 

to on a few ballot initiatives that 
are going up,” Conybeare said. 
“We have not endorsed any. But 
if someone reaches out to me and 
asks if they can come talk about 
a city issue, we always work with 
them to inform our members 
and get the word out.”

This idea of “getting the word 

out” seems to be both the most 
important and most challenging 
piece of the puzzle for those who 
are involved in city politics. LSA 
senior Jeremy Glick sits on the 
City Council Student Advisory 
Committee, and he said the 
committee 
is 
talking 
about 

not just how to get students 
registered, but how to get them 
informed.

“This is obviously something 

we’re taking on with this new 
registration challenge, but it’s 
something we’ve also talked 
about as well — about informing 
students of what’s going on 
at a local level,” Glick said. 
“Especially when things like 
rent prices, where buildings are, 

how many units are available are 
so important to us as students 
are really formed at the council 
level … One of the biggest things 
I wish students would realize, 
especially those who aren’t 
from Michigan, or from this 
part of Michigan, is that voting 
and understanding issues goes 
completely beyond just voting 
for president every four years.”

LSA junior Sam Weinberg is 

another member of the small 
minority of students involved 
in local politics. Serving as the 
field director for Jared Hoffert’s 
City Council campaign in Ann 
Arbor’s 2nd Ward, Weinberg 
echoed Glick’s message.

“I think there’s a lot of focus 

— by all people but especially 
young people — to focus on a 
higher voter turnout in national 
elections 
rather 
than 
state 

elections,” Weinberg said. “But 
a lot of change can occur in 
local elections, which I think is 
underappreciated … I just wish 
voter turnout was a lot higher.”

“I don’t think students 

realize how much power they 
have in town.”

Among 
City 
Council 

candidates 
themselves, 
the 

views on student involvement 
are mixed.

Ann Arbor resident Diane 

Giannola, currently running for a 
Ward 4 seat on City Council, told 
The Daily in a video interview 
last week that she doesn’t feel 
most of the city’s issues actually 
apply to students.

“There’s only specific items 

that are relevant to students,” 
Giannola said. “I think people 
make too big of a deal about 
students not voting, because 
I think most students still 
have their licenses at their 
home address, which is where 
they’re politically involved… I 
understand that students don’t 
care about it. There’s nothing 
that’s gonna get them out to vote. 
But they can have a big impact 
on those things that are right 
around campus. But they have to 
want to have an impact. We can’t 
make them come out to vote.”

leader of the resistance for all 14 … 
but I’m tired of being the leader of 
the resistance. It is time for us to 
start setting the agenda.”

Rowan Conybeare, a Public 

Policy senior and the chair of College 
Democrats, said the attendance 
at recent events for gubernatorial 
candidates is encouraging and 
could be a sign that Democrats will 
win back seats in 2018.

“I’m really excited that the 

various gubernatorial candidates 
have wanted to come speak with us. 
She is our third,” Conybeare said. 
“I think we need to be careful, but 
I think it could be indicative of the 
democratic wave that everyone is 
talking about in 2018. I do not think 
it is a given. I think that students, 
Democrats and Michigan as a whole 
need to work just as hard as we 
would have if we had won in 2016.”

An issue at the center of the 

race is preventing post college 
brain drain. In an interview with 
the Daily, Whitmer discussed the 
importance of making college more 
affordable and, at some point, free.

“One of the things that I worked 

on as a senate Democratic leader, 
I authored a plan that I called 
the Michigan 2020 plan which 
would’ve provided free four-year 
college for every Michigan student,” 
Whitmer said. “That was something 
that I’ve always been a champion 
of and I know what that means 
for young people pursuing their 
dreams. … I think if we create those 
opportunities here, that’s one of the 
most important things we can do to 
keeping young talent in Michigan.”

Following 
the 
monologue, 

Whitmer spent majority of the 
event answering questions from the 
audience. In many of the questions, 
especially 
when 
compared 
to 

Democratic 
candidate 
Abdul 

El-Sayed, Whitmer emphasized 
the amount of experience she 
has in state government and how 
that gives her a leg up on other 
candidates.

CAMPAIGN
From Page 1A


A 
 

thought popped into my 
head as I walked out of 
Hill 
Auditorium 
after 

a live Q&A with a 
politician 
I 
deeply 

respect, 
Hillary 

Clinton. I realized that, 
to 
my 
recollection, 

Clinton didn’t mention 
a single word about 
the 
mistakes 
her 

campaign 
made 
in 

2016. 
To 
be 
sure, 

Russian interference, 
voter 
suppression 

and 
former 
FBI 

director Jim Comey’s 
statements had an enormous 
impact on the ultimate outcome. 
However, 
surely 
the 
Clinton 

campaign would change some 
aspects of their strategy if they 
could run all over again. 

I worry my blindness in the 

moment to Clinton’s mistakes is 
indicative of a larger, problematic 
trend 
in 
the 
United 
States. 

The American voter tends to 
mythologize the political figures 
we support, transforming them 
into heroes whom we project our 
hopes and dreams onto. Idolizing 
politicians in this way can only 
lead 
to 
disappointment 
and 

political fragmentation.

The 
realities 
of 
modern 

campaigning 
exacerbate 
the 

American tendency to herald 
our chosen candidates as heroes. 
Campaigns run relentless ads 
exalting their candidate as a 
pillar of American exceptionalism 
and 
ruthlessly 
demonizing 

their opponent. For example, 
Ed Gillespie, Republican and 
Virginia gubernatorial candidate, 
ran 
a 
commercial 
about 
a 

month ago tying his opponent 
to the notoriously violent MS-13 
gang. The words “Kill, Rape, 
Control” flash across the screen 
a split second before Gillespie’s 
opponent’s 
face 
appears. 
By 

contrast, the ad paints Gillespie 
as a conquering hero ready to 
vanquish the dangers of gang 
violence. Ads like these exploit 
primal human emotions like fear 
to convince voters that politicians 
exist as either evil villains or 
virtuous heroes.

Viral marketing and social 

media further distort American 
perceptions of politicians. When 
we circulate memes of politicians 
online, when we watch politicians 
in funny late night TV bits and 
when we unquestioningly retweet 
politicians, we imbue our elected 
officials with celebrity status. 
This social media content and 

the short attention span of the 
internet reward charisma over 
policy substance.

Additionally, 

the 
current 

extreme 
political 

polarization 
within 

the U.S. encourages 
unquestioned loyalty 
to 
and 
admiration 

for party candidates. 
Polls 
from 
2014 

indicate 
Americans 

are 
more 
likely 

than ever before to 
consistently express a 
liberal or conservative 

viewpoint. 
This 
ideological 

consistency 
carries 
over 
to 

people’s friend groups and social 
media; over a third of Americans 
only see one ideological viewpoint 
represented on their social media 
feeds. These sort of echo chambers 
encourage political groupthink 
by expressing the same opinions 
over and over again. If a voter 
observes near constant praise for 
their party’s preferred candidate 
online, they may be more likely 
to observe that politician as an 
infallible hero.

The idolization of politicians 

carries 
troubling 
implications 

for American democracy. First, 
viewing politicians as heroes 
blinds voters to their candidate’s 
flaws. A perfect example lies in 
the Democratic opinion of Barack 
Obama’s economic policies. A 
Reuters poll from 2015 indicated 
64 percent of Democrats believed 
Obama’s policies improved the 
economy. 
However, 
economic 

data indicates the economy has 
improved mostly for the rich, not 
for those of lower socioeconomic 
status, 
thus 
exacerbating 

economic inequality. Evidence 
indicates 
Obama’s 
policies 

directly contributed to the rise of 
the rich and stagnation of middle 
American incomes; when the 
economy collapsed, the Dodd-
Frank Wall Street Reform Act 
left giant loopholes for financiers 
to jump through, instead of 
tightening regulations on big 
banks and Wall Street. 

Of course, this sort of blindness 

extends to the other side of the 
aisle. How else could 81 percent 
of white Evangelical Christians 
vote for Donald Trump (a man 
who brags openly about sexual 
assault and was pro-choice until 
2011)? Though Trump’s behavior 
arguably 
violates 
Christian 

morals, Evangelicals voted for 
him because they believed the 
Republican party would advance 

important 
goals 
like 
pro-life 

legislation and curbing illegal 
immigration. Political idolization 
prevents voters from holding 
officials accountable for their 
policy and moral failures.

When we put our politicians 

on 
pedastals, 
we 
imbue 

them with more power than 
they actually have to make 
change; this inevitably leads to 
disappointment. The U.S. political 
system was designed to preserve 
the status quo. Politicians aiming 
to make change must confront 
three branches of government, a 
bicameral legislature, federalism, 
factional and partisan politics and 
hostile special interests every step 
of the way. In recent years, 
about only three percent of 
bills considered in Congress 
became laws.

The enormous gap between 

voter 
expectations 
and 

the legislative reality only 
breeds 
disappointment 
and 

resentment, as demonstrated 
by 
Congress’s 
current 
13 

percent approval rating. This 
sort of frustration may be a 
significant cause of America’s 
embarrassingly 
low 
voter 

turnout rate. Tempering our 
expectations may ultimately 
reduce our collective cynicism 
about the democratic process.

Lastly, worshipping a single 

politician can blind voters to the 
merits of other candidates who 
may advance their interests. 
The phenomenon of the small 
amount 
of 
Bernie 
Sanders 

supporters 
who 
voted 
for 

Donald Trump demonstrates 
this danger. The proportion 
may seem insignificant at an 
estimated 12 percent. However, 
Trump’s 
margin 
of 
victory 

was very small in states like 
Michigan; 
perhaps 
those 

lost votes could have made 
a difference if they went to 
Hillary Clinton. Though Bernie 
falls ideologically left of Clinton, 
surely a President Clinton would 
have advanced policies more 
favorable to Bernie supporters 
than President Trump has.

I’m not advocating adopting 

a jaded stance toward all 
politicians. 
Elected 
officials 

can be great role models, and I 
believe most are true patriots. 
I only ask we hold our favorite 
politicians 
accountable 
for 

their actions and not fall into 
blind devotion. 

I

n discourse about politics, I 
see increased divisiveness, 
cynicism and an averseness 

to 
perspective 
and 

debate. In laying out 
the problematic ideas 
and beliefs I see coming 
from 
“democratic 

socialists,” 
I 
can 

confidently 
say 
(as 

someone who defines 
himself as a moderate/
centrist liberal) the 
terms 
“liberal” 
and 

“democratic socialists” 
are not synonymous.

Political 
commentator 

David Sirota, a self-professed 
progressive 
liberal, 
states 

that “there is a fundamental 
difference” between a centrist 
liberal 
and 
a 
“progressive.” 

The 
term 
“progressive” 
or 

“democratic socialist,” which 
I find to mean the same, is 
normally 
a 
politically 
fiscal 

concept. According to Sirota, 
“‘liberals’ ... are those who focus 
on using taxpayer money to help 
better society.” He continues, 
“‘progressive’(s) are those who 
focus on using government power 
to make large institutions play by 
a set of rules.” In addition to this 
definition, I find “democratic 
socialism/progressivism” 
has 
developed 
an 
ideology 

where self-referentiality is the 
foundation of morality.

Let me be clear: There are issues 

our country needs to fix. I certainly 
want and work for women to be 
treated respectfully, and that 
everyone, regardless of gender, 
race or religion, should receive 
equal opportunities. To me, this 
is simply being a good human. 
But when these morally sound 
baselines are hyper-contorted to 
fit ideology, not policy, the issues 
become misconstrued. There isn’t 
actually a push for progress, but 
rather a tit-for-tat competition of 
who can be the most “progressive.”

One of the larger issues I’ve 

noticed 
is 
the 
“democratic 

socialist” mindset — a blind faith 
in some policies not because they 
are understood, but because they 
sound nice. This leads to easily-
repeated phrases and slogans 
(“resist, resist, resist”) that, I 
guarantee you, most of their users 
do not understand. It’s just the 

“right thing” to say — and people 
retweet, like and pat them on the 
back for doing so.

For example, some 

cite Bernie Sanders 
on the importance of 
free college education. 
A common solution 
provided 
is 
taxing 

more of the wealthy 
corporations so that 
our education could 
be paid. But do you 
understand 
the 
tax 

systems 
involved? 

Do you understand 

the necessary restructuring of 
existing policy? Do you reckon 
that some privileges might be 
taken away? I reckon that almost 
all these individuals who abide by 
such beliefs don’t know; rather, 
they faithfully follow the leader. 
This is highly problematic. Though 
reduced college fees certainly 
aren’t unreasonable, it is still our 
duty as citizens to understand 
policy and logically develop our 
own ideas, not base our logic in 
niceties and emotional rhetoric.

In addition, the “progressive” 

movement has begun to use 
tactics scarily similar to the Tea 
Party’s, much of which includes 
their 
response 
to 
President 

Obama’s stimulus bailout package 
in 2009. What started as an issue 
on fiscal policy quickly became 
an organization that popularized 
and 
espoused 
some 
deeply 

questionable ideas, such as the 
birther movement, and welcomed 
problematic 
people, 
such 
as 

Donald Trump. In addition, people 
in the Tea Party had a sense of 
disdain for dialogue and believed 
the system doesn’t need to be 
improved, but destroyed. From my 
perspective, eerily similar notions 
from the “democratic socialists” 
are being espoused. The biggest 
difference is that the baseline 
notions of progressivism are good, 
but their intents are taken far out 
of proportion.

An issue in “progressivism” is 

an aversion to introspection on the 
morality of the movement, since 
many of the underlying values 
are moral and just. Therefore, 
whenever there is a “screaming 
match” against a campus speaker, 
there’s a sense of a moral “high 
ground” because it is “in the name 

of” equality. Therefore, any action 
(though possibly uncouth and 
quite morally dubious) that defeats 
the “perpetrator” is acceptable. 
There’s no actual dialogue to 
question, to think about their own 
ideas and to debunk questionable 
notions. It’s just a mob looking for 
a person or group to blame and 
demolish. “Democratic socialism” 
now isn’t about change — it’s about 
getting even. 

I find that, in the name of 

increased 
dialogue, 
equality, 

justice and other good things, 
the “progressive” movement has 
played a bit of mental gymnastics 
with the semantics of these words. 
These words push politics into a 
competition, not actually hoping 
for true progress, but a sense of 
camaraderie among only certain 
individuals and a personal need 
for acceptance. The movement has 
become a contest of who can be 
more “progressive” and who needs 
to be done away with — rather than 
persuaded and reformed.

Furthermore, 
the 
sense 
of 

morality is almost entirely based 
on 
self-referentiality. 
If 
only 

one person has qualms about a 
certain phrase, word or minute 
action, 
everything 
associated 

with that deed is regarded as 
morally problematic. Though this 
sometimes is fine, my problem is 
that “progressives” today deem 
this the end of the discussion. 
There are no follow-up questions, 
or only some social group can 
comment. Otherwise, any remarks 
are seen as unethical and an 
egregious act against a particular 
group of people.

I hope that the Democratic 

Party, which I usually support, 
takes a step back and doesn’t adopt 
this ideology into its platforms. 
If the Democrats want to win in 
2018, they must begin to distance 
themselves from this mindset. 
Though the baselines for this 
movement are things I work 
and advocate for, the aggressive, 
exclusionary, 
hyper-partisan 

rhetoric the “democratic socialists” 
push will only create more divide, 
which then creates more tumult to 
the chagrin of more retweets, more 
likes and smugger political sport.

:47 
p.m.: 
My 

appointment 
is 
at 

1:00 p.m., so I decide 

to take an Uber to the clinic, 
wondering if the driver can sense 
my discomfort.

The worst day of my life 

was not the night of my rape. 
It wasn’t printing out a coupon 
for Plan B the next day. It also 
wasn’t when I wrote my suicide 
note seven months later and 
went to bed hoping I wouldn’t 
wake up in the morning. It is 
this day, two months after my 
assault, sobbing in a strange 
bathroom for 45 minutes, that is 
seared into my memory.

1:15 p.m.: I am sitting in 

the waiting room of Planned 
Parenthood, slightly shaking as I 
fill out paperwork.

Post-traumatic stress disorder 

is strange and unpredictable. 
It had my brain inputting my 
assaulter’s face on nearly all 
men in my life, avoiding walking 
anywhere from my usual routes 
and forgetting important details 
of that night only for them to 
come back in jarring flashbacks. 
I avoided intentionally thinking 
or 
talking 
about 
anything 

relating to my assault, which is 
why I waited to get tested for 
STIs and HIV until two months 
after I was raped.

1:43 p.m.: The results of my 

rapid HIV test are negative. We 
just need a urine sample for the 
STI test, the nurse says, adding 
that they won’t call me unless it’s 
proven positive.

To 
say 
I 
am 
cautious 

regarding sex would be a huge 
understatement. I had always 
been so careful with condoms 

and birth control in order to 
minimize any risk of pregnancy 
and disease. The night I was 
raped, I was unsure of anything 
that occurred; I had no control 
in the situation. I remembered 
few details, and I didn’t trust 
his account. I felt so stupid. This 
never should have happened. 
How could I have let this happen 
to me?

2:28 p.m.: I have been sitting 

on the toilet for 30 minutes now, 
with the water running to garner 
a urine sample of any sort. The 
sooner I get this done, the sooner 
I can leave, I think, with tears 
streaming down my cheeks.

Why me? I couldn’t look 

at 
myself 
anymore, 
feeling 

disgusted and betrayed by my 
own body. I remember looking 
in 
the 
mirror 
10 
minutes 

after my assault and telling 
myself that I was a whore. 
A 
controlling, 
long-distance 

ex-boyfriend would get angry 
when I partied and said that 
one day I would get raped. He 
was right.

2:41 p.m.: I shut the bathroom 

door behind me and tell the 
nurse I couldn’t do the urine 
sample between sobs. She takes 
me aside, and I tell her I was 
assaulted. She asks if I am 
seeing a therapist, I tell her I am 
currently seeing two.

The first close friend I told 

said to not make a big deal 
about it. The first therapist 
I told said I needed to take 
responsibility for my drinking. 
I became more guarded than 
I ever had been. For months, I 
would stay up until early hours 
in the morning, searching the 
internet for resources to tell me 
if I was right or if they were.

2:52 p.m.: I finish the cup of 

water the nurse gave me and 
compose myself enough to walk 
out of the office. I schedule an 
appointment for 4:00 p.m. later 

that day in hopes my bladder 
will comply.

Saying 
the 
word 
“rape” 

wasn’t something I could do 
until nearly a year later. Rape 
was violent and I never fought 
back that night; I just laid there 
and tried to get it over with as 
soon as possible. I remember 
thinking, “No I don’t want this 
and I don’t like him holding my 
head down, but I’m too drunk to 
fend him off and I said no earlier 
so why would he listen now and 
it will be over soon enough.” It 
wasn’t sex, I was just a body to 
masturbate into. What worth 
do I have now? Who would ever 
love a damaged girl?

4:12 p.m.: I return to the clinic 

in fresh makeup and finally 
complete the urine test. I don’t 
receive a call from the clinic, 
meaning I am clean. I breathe 
for what seems like the first time 
in months.

I ache for all those girls who 

were before me, as I am sure 
I was not the only one. I ache 
for my friends who all say they 
have had something similar 
happen to them before. I ache 
for my parents who learned 
months later and never wanted 
to believe something like this 
could happen to their baby girl. 
But I don’t ache for myself. For 
months, I went into survival 
mode and did the absolute 
minimum to go on to the next 
day. I haven’t felt anything since 
the night where my body, trust 
and innocence were taken from 
me. As if under anesthesia, I 
feel pressure but no pain — just 
absolute numbness.

Who is A. Boogie?
‘No Questions About Lil 
B’: In conversation with 
A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie

I’ve been obsessing over A. 

Boogie Wit Da Hoodie for quite 
some time now. His trademarked 
sound (a natural yet unexpected 
blend of post-Drake era harmonies 
with gritty horror-core subject 
matter) has made him a fixture 
within 
hip 
hop’s 
emergent 

generation — the rare youngster 
who’s neither wholly resistant 
to nor blindly acceptant of old 
school practices. For this reason, 
I 
employed 
the 
Bronx-raised 

crooner as a centerpiece in my ode 
to New York hip hop last winter, 
and in February, I drove all the way 
to Columbus, OH for his concert 
(which turned out to be a lousy 
club walkthrough). I even eagerly 
anticipated the late September 
release of his debut album, The 
Bigger Artist, which enhanced 
production value and earned the 
number one spot on Billboard’s hip 
hop/R&B chart.

However, last week, when news 

began circulating that A. Boogie 
had physically attacked Lil B “THE 
BASED GOD” at Rolling Loud 
Music Festival, I consequently 
unfollowed him on multiple social 
media under an assumption that I 
would no longer be able to root for 
his success.

So, what was I to do when, on 

Sunday evening, I got offered a 
10 minute phone conversation 
with A. Boogie in promotion of 
his upcoming concert in Detroit? 
I 
instinctively 
accepted 
then 

constructed a mental strategy in 
which I expected to transition 
from casual small talk to a more 
combative discussion about the 
BASED GOD. (“Shouts out to a 
boogie,” Lil B wrote on Twitter, 
publicly diffusing tensions after the 
altercation; “Is it really all love?” I 
imagined myself inquiring.)

This plan almost actualized 

too, until exactly two minutes 
prior to my Tuesday conversation 
with A. Boogie, when I received 
a confirmation from his team 
bearing exactly one condition: 
“Heads up has been given and no 
questions about LIL B,” the email 
read.

Immediately, I found myself 

navigating a journalistic semi-
crisis, weighing the pros and cons 
of agitating a newly-platinum 
rapper who’s bragged of having 
“shooters beside (him).” Even 
whilst speaking with A. Boogie, I 
remained undecided on the issue 
and suppressant of my intrinsic 
desire to surge for the story. I was 

finally convinced not to, though, 
by A. Boogie’s genuine likability: 
Throughout 
our 
conversation, 

he displayed both a focused 
work-ethic and passionate belief 
in 
loyalty; 
he 
simultaneously 

presented 
the 
unapologetic 

attitude of a street-raised business 
bull (think Jay Z, one of his idols) 
aside the softer, calmer tone of a 
sweetheart big brother.

Who is A. Boogie? That remains 

up for interpretation (much like 
the circumstances that led to his 
controversy with Lil B). What’s 
known for certain, though, is that 
he won’t allow himself to be boxed 
in — not by his geographically, 
generationally or even by the 
“BASED GOD.”

***

You’ve had a wildly exciting 

year: Between the birth of your 
daughter in February to the 
recent release of your debut 
album, a lot of milestones have 
been crossed. How do you 
manage to stay grounded amidst 
such consistent growth?

I just keep positive people 

around me, I keep the same, same 
day ones around me, you feel me? 
And I just keep doing what I’m 
doing plus more. As long as you 
keep doing what you’re doing plus 
more, you always gonna succeed 
and be successful.

How did it feel to have The 

Bigger Artist debut as the number 
one album on Billboard’s R&B 
/ Hip-Hop charts? Was that 
something you were striving 
for?

Yeah, man, that’s something 

I feel like, I checked it off my 
checklist and I’m on to the next 
one. Now, I’m trying to win a 
Grammy, feel me?

One of the album’s most deep-

cutting songs is its introduction, 
“No Promises,” on which you 
rap: 
“Lifestyle 
getting 
out 

of 
control, 
lifestyle 
getting 

ludicrous / I made a mili in less 
than a year and I blew that on 
stupid shit.” What were some of 
the first things that you splurged 
on 
after 
initially 
becoming 

successful?

Man, some of the first things I 

bought, I went right to Avianne, 
copped mad ice, got my mom a crib, 
gave my mom some bread, I gave a 
lot of love to a lot of family when I 
first got money.

What’s different about being 

in New York City now, as a 
celebrity, versus being there 
before as a regular kid from the 
Bronx?

Man, being from New York City, 

first of all it’s hard coming out of 

NYC, making it though. So, I’m 
just, I feel like I could do a lot, just 
‘cause I did that. It’s a blessing, you 
feel me, and I feel like I got that 
prince, I feel like I’m in that prince 
spot right now.

You 
told 
Complex 
that 

growing up, you rarely traveled 
out of Highbridge because: “The 
Bronx really don’t get along like 
that.” Is it all love everywhere 
when you go back now?

Yeah, 
I 
feel 
like 
that’s 

everywhere though. Like, when 
you go to Brooklyn, people in 
Brooklyn don’t get along with 
Brooklyn people, Bronx don’t get 
along with Bronx people, just cause 
like, you’re all too close to each 
other and everything I feel like 
though. It’s different.

As you head out on this world 

tour, headlining concerts in 
Europe and different countries, 
what are you most excited to see 
or do for the first time?

Um, I don’t really know, I’m just 

looking forward to learning new 
things and seeing new things, and 
knowing what the whole overseas 
thing is about. Everywhere you go 
is always different, so you never 
know what to expect … I’m excited 
to perform in London. I sold out in 
London.

Are we ever going to get 

those collab projects with Don 
Q or PnB Rock that you’ve been 
teasing?

Man, I’m good at those, but … I 

got everybody’s songs. I’m gonna 
release a whole bunch of music out 
of nowhere, so …

How did it feel to be a part of 

the XXL Freshman Class? Do 
you feel connected to that new 
wave in hip hop that’s emerging, 
or are you kind of like an old 
head within that crowd?

Nah, I still fuck with the 

old heads, but I fuck with my 
generation too. I’m learning. Like, 
my generation is still new to me, so 
I’m still learning new things about 
hip hop these days. That XXL part 
right there was just like, man … 
I’m glad I did that ‘cause my whole 
teenage life was just looking at the 
XXL (and) who was on it on the 
next year, on the next year … So, me 
being on it for last year was just a 
blessing bro.

You told Billboard that you’re 

considering 
going 
back 
to 

school. Would you ever consider 
coming here, to the University of 
Michigan? I can give you a tour if 
you need.

Who knows? Who knows where 

I end up man, you’ll probably catch 
me somewhere in the cut with a 
hoodie.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

Across her various phases, Tay-
lor Swift’s music has garnered 
a wide-ranging set of opinions. 
Despite this, she has consis-
tently released fantastic music 
videos; case and point is the first 
single from her forthcoming LP 
Reputation, “Look What You 
Made Me Do” and its accom-
panying video. The song was 
polarizing, yet the video was 
an impressively complex and 
well-thought-out spectacle. Her 
streak of excellent music videos 
just ended. The latest addition 
to her repertoire — the visual 
accompaniment to new single 
“...Ready For It?” — is unchar-
acteristically bad, despite being 
the strongest track we’ve heard 
off of Reputation thus far.
The sci-fi-inspired “...Ready 
For It?” video unsuccessfully 
attempts a cliché narrative, 

pitting a Taylor Swift dressed 
in S&M inspired black with 
a Taylor in a skin-colored 
bodysuit that makes her look 
nude. Clearly, we are leagues 
past “Teardrops On My Guitar.” 
The bodysuit itself, an apparent 
reference to the garb worn by 
the protagonist of the “Ghost in 
the Shell” franchise, generated a 
Twitter eruption and seemed to 
be one of the few things worth 
commenting on from the entire 
video.
Otherwise, we have a poorly 
developed storyline that 
attempts to paint nude-bodysuit 
Taylor (who eventually morphs 
into white-bodysuit Taylor) 
as a sympathetic character 
trapped in a glass box, who 
ultimately escapes by defeat-
ing black-hooded Taylor. In the 
process we discover the latter 

is actually a robot. How can 
Swift expect the public to buy 
into her latest bad girl persona 
when it’s the white-clad Taylor 
who is destroying the villainous 
Taylor? Given the size of her 
PR team, one would expect this 
new phase to be significantly 
more refined than it is.
The only redeeming quality of 
the video is the visual editing. 
It seems like Swift and direc-
tor Joseph Kahn wanted to 
hit every button on the effects 
dashboard, resulting in an 
incredible menage of lightning 
bolts, armored horses, mechani-
cal eyeballs, glowing orbs and 
robotic spiders — the video is 
certainly a spectacle. However, 
it sacrifices content and story-
line in the name of effects and 
ultimately falls flat as a result.

FX

‘American Horror Story’ is currently on its seventh season
It’s time to break up with 
‘American Horror Story’

One writer’s look at the slow decline of the popular FX show

Before the co-creators of “Glee” 

Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk 
debuted their anthology series 
“American Horror Story” back in 
2011, the television world had no 
idea what it was in for. With the 
help of some ambiguous, visually-
enticing trailers, the creators left 
prospective viewers with more 
questions than answers on what 
to expect — effectively creating a 
widespread buzz before the show’s 
premiere. A genius marketing 
technique could have been enough 
alone to launch lesser shows, but 
the Murphy and Falchuk had so 
many more tricks up their sleeves.

When I first heard the creators 

of “Glee” were making a horror 
show, I scoffed. I thought: Haven’t 
they done enough damage to the 
realm of TV with their tacky, 
musical contribution? So imagine 
my surprise when I found myself 
tuning in for their new show every 
week, counting down the days 
to each new episode. “American 
Horror Story” was like nothing I 
had ever seen before, and being 
someone 
with 
a 
DNA-deep 

aversion to scary things, it spoke 
to the show’s quality that even I 
could withstand the spooks.

Season one of “AHS” was 

everything I could ask for from a 
TV show. It was cinemagraphic, 
well-written, sexy, suspenseful, 
compelling and the list goes on. 
Amidst all the sexual and horror-
driven thrills, season one, “Murder 
House,” had a cohesive plot and a 
knockout concept. The idea of a 
victorian age home holding all the 
spirits who had ever come to pass 
within its walls made for a wide 
playing field for the writers — and 
they used it wisely. The addition 
of 
backstories 
of 
tangential 

characters being added slowly 
to the greater story line of the 

Harmon family gave encapturing 
tidbits of these surrounding spirits, 
intercutting 
between 
different 

periods of time, all without 
detracting from the story arc.

Aside from the consistency 

in directorial style and strength 
in the base concept, just about 
everything great about season 
one would come to slowly fall 
away in those following. Many 
cite the beginning of the end with 
season three, “Coven,” — which 
did undeniably suck — but to me 
the issues that would become the 
all out downfall of “AHS” were 
birthed in season two.

The idea of a horror story in 

a 1960s asylum was by far the 
theme that resonated with me 
the most. It felt, however, as 
though the creators lost all sense 
of restraint from this season 
forward — perhaps on the high of 
a wild success in their first season. 
The addition of Adam Levine 
(“The Voice”) and Jenna Dewan 
Tatum (“Step Up”) to the cast 
highlighted what would continue 
to be a pointless piece of the “AHS” 
rhetoric: 
Irrelevant 
celebrities 

being added on for the sake of 
star power. Cough, cough — I love 
you, Stevie Nicks, but you had no 
business coming on this supposed 
horror show. 

Season two, like every season 

of “AHS,” was incredible in its 
concept, but rather than letting 
the strength of that stand on its 
own, the creators stuffed each 
episode full of every bit of shock 
value they could get their hands 
on. Adding in alien probings, 
flesh-eating 
creatures 
and 
a 

polyamorous ending for Evan 
Peters (“X-Men: Apocalypse”), the 
season just ended on a sour note 
for me, which was indicative of 
what was to come. While horror 
is about making a viewer squirm 
and jump, the show became less 
about beautifully built-up tragic 
or terrifying storylines that made 

it what it was and more about 
pushing the “Did they really just 
do that?” feeling. 

By season four, “Freak Show,” 

it felt as though Murphy and 
Falchuk were just drunk off the 
power of this empire they had 
created, feeling they could do no 
wrong. Again, while this season 
had things that worked, they 
continued trying to squish in every 
star, every OMG moment, every 
grotesque sex scene they possibly 
could. To add insult to injury, 
the creators let their true colors 
seep through with the addition 
of terribly tacky and pointless 
musical numbers. I could have 
gone the rest of my life without 
hearing Evan Peters perform 
Nirvana, or without hearing Sarah 
Paulson (“American Gothic”) do 
the ugliest cry known to mankind 
throughout every season, for that 
matter.

While nothing can take away 

the majesty of season one, the 
steady decline of “AHS” ’s quality 
has just desecrated the good name 
it once made for itself. Mind you, 
many of the flaws were forgivable 
enough, considering I made it 
through season seven, “Roanoke.” 
But that was more out of a morbid 
curiosity of how much worse 
the show could have possibly 
gotten and what jaw-dropping 
boundaries they would be pushing 
this season.

Where I draw the line, however, 

is the most recent season, “Cult.” 
It took about under 10 minutes 
for me to recognize that all I had 
once loved about the show had 
vanished, and in its place was just 
an obnoxious soap box for social 
commentary, hidden under the 
thin veil of a shitty plot. I really 
never wanted to lose faith in you, 
“AHS” (I really tried), but it’s just 
gone too far. I wish I could say the 
creators should quit while they’re 
ahead, but that chance already 
came and went.

SHOWTIME

‘White Noise’ premiered on Showtime this past Sunday
‘White Famous’ could be 
funny, if it wasn’t just lazy

Jay Pharaoh’s new show offers little humor with bad, sexist writing

“Saturday 
Night 
Live” 
has 

become known as a machine for 
cranking out comedy stars. Input 
a famished improv actor who 
does a decent George W. Bush 
impression, and out pops a shiny 
new celebrity with two book deals 
and a TV show already signed on 
for three seasons. With his new 
Showtime comedy, Jay Pharaoh 
is the most recent and former 
“SNL” cast member trying to 
take advantage of that seemingly 
flawless formula. Unfortunately 
for him, the machine is still 
working out some kinks.

“White Famous” has a great 

idea delivered through a bad TV 
show. Floyd Mooney (Jay Pharoah) 
is a young comedian trying not to 
betray his hometown roots as he 
works toward becoming “white 
famous.” He’s got everything 
you’d 
expect 
a 
bright-eyed, 

up-and-coming 
comedian 
to 

have: 
An 
overzealous 
agent 

(Utkarsh Ambudkar, “The Mindy 
Project”), an on-again / off-again 
relationship with the mother of his 
child (Cleopatra Coleman, “The 
Last Man on Earth” ), an implicitly 
racist boss (Stephen Tobolowsky, 
“One Day at a Time”) and even an 
encouraging yet slightly crazed 
mentor Jamie Foxx (“Baby Driver”) 
who plays himself. But even with a 
talented cast and a solid concept, 

the show struggles to feel like 
something substantive and worthy 
of more than just a single episode.

You know when the ticket 

person at the movie theater says 
“enjoy the movie” and you respond 
with “thanks, you too?” That is 
what it feels like to watch “White 
Famous.” 
It’s 
not 
completely 

wrong, but it does leave everyone 
involved feeling just a little bit off. 
Pharoah’s character seems to be 
stuck in a single, ongoing comedy 
sketch, and the joke wears down 

about 10 minutes into the half-
hour-long episode. By the time 
you’re done watching, there’s 
nothing left to look forward to. 
Mooney gets a job on a big movie 
set, him and his ex-girlfriend are 
on relatively friendly terms and 
the agent he fired at the beginning 
of the episode is already back 
working for him. Every conflict 
that arises as a possible storyline 
is resolved by the episode’s end, 
leaving no reason to tune in next 
week or any week after that.

It’s disappointing given the 

show’s potential to address real 

problems present in Hollywood. 
At one point, Mooney complains 
to Foxx that everytime a Black 
man tries to climb the ladder 
in Hollywood, directors try to 
emasculate him by putting him in 
a dress. It’s a fascinating point, and 
one that can be seen in Dwayne 
Johnson’s “Tooth Fairy” and Tyler 
Perry’s “Madea” series, among 
numerous other examples. Yet 
instead of exploring this topic, Foxx 
brushes off the comment, and it’s 
never really addressed again.

The 
show’s 
capacity 
to 

humorously address the societal 
pressure of being a Black man in 
Hollywood is also ruined by its 
blatant sexism. You can’t pick and 
choose what minority group you 
aren’t going to offend and which 
one you are — it’s kind of an all-
in, all-out deal. If you can’t be 
funny without uncomfortable Bill 
Cosby jokes and an old White dude 
that’s racist and sexist (but we’re 
supposed to understand that’s 
wrong, so it’s a joke), than you 
aren’t really funny, you’re just lazy.

There’s no doubt that Jay 

Pharaoh is a talented young 
comedian whose talents extend 
beyond 
the 
impressions 
that 

defined his run on “SNL,” but 
“White Famous” is not the show 
to demonstrate that. If, like his 
character, 
Pharaoh 
wants 
to 

become the next Eddie Murphy or 
Chris Rock, he may have to put on 
that hypothetical dress and take 
some more daring steps to stardom.

CINEFLEX

We’re not a fan
YouTube film critique’s 
swift and plaguing rise

Vloggers surge in popularity threatens cinephile community

Tony Zhou struck internet 

gold in 2014. His YouTube 
channel 
Every 
Frame 
a 

Painting, with over a million 
subscribers, 
produces 
video 

essays analyzing nuances in 
filmmaking, 
like 
the 
Coen 

Brothers’ 
reverse 
shots 
or 

the use of silence in “Raging 
Bull.” 
Along 
with 
other 

popular channels — CineFix, 
Nerdwriter, Closer Look and 
Karsten Runquist — Every 
Frame a Painting is a major 
player in a booming market for 
video essays.

That market, however, is 

very one-dimensional: A man, 
presumably in his mid-20s, 
talks about why a director, 
often David Fincher, is just so 
damn great after pointing out a 
somewhat obvious filmmaking 
technique. People watch these 
videos without having seen 
the 
movies 
he’s 
critiquing 

and close their laptops feeling 
smart. Worse yet, they feel 
like they never have to see the 
movie at all.

CineFix’s 
content 
in 

particular irks me and is 
the epitome of why these 
essays produce a new level of 
pretentiousness. This channel 
creates listicle videos ranking 
the “best” of something, like 
the most beautiful shots in 
cinema. One video discusses 
the most beautiful movies of all 
time: Stanley Kubrick’s (“Eyes 
Wide Shut”) “Barry Lyndon” is 

listed for its shots that replicate 
paintings. Truth be told, at 
least 95 percent of the video’s 
viewers haven’t seen the movie. 
And a high percentage of that 
group probably never will.

If those who never saw the 

movie accepted their ignorance 
and didn’t act knowledgeable, 
all 
would 
be 
well. 
Sadly, 

this is rarely true. I’ve had 
conversations 
with 
devoted 

CineFix viewers where I’ll be 
bombarded with information 
about how beautiful “Barry 
Lyndon” is. But when I ask 
them their favorite scene, they 
daftly reply, “Oh, I’ve never 
seen it.”

Watching a video essay does 

not give you the right to talk 
about a movie as if it’s your 
favorite, especially when you 
couldn’t be bothered to spend 
187 minutes sitting through 
“Barry Lyndon.”

The origins of the rising 

popularity 
of 
video 
essays 

likely dates back to Anthony 
Fantano’s 
popular 
music 

channel, The Needle Drop. 
Although he’s not producing 
video 
essays, 
per 
se, 
his 

content 
involves 
in-depth 

music critique reflecting his 
wide, developed taste for just 
about every genre of music. 
He paved the way for future 
video essayists to make their 
own 
statements. 
Fantano, 

however, doesn’t take himself 
too seriously, unlike many of 
his essayist successors.

In many ways, the film 

criticism community loosening 
its barriers to entry is a feat. 
But we’ll always need a decent 

amount 
of 
tweed-wearing 

academics writing lengthy film 
critiques. The truth is, a lot of 
the video essayists’ content is 
not entirely original and comes 
from the work of PhD-holding 
professors. Everyone should be 
able to express their opinions 
about films. But not everyone 
can be a film critic, at least not 
in the scholarly sense of the 
word.

Obviously, 
not 
all 
video 

essays 
are 
bad. 
Kogonada, 

prominent 
up-and-comer 

responsible for “Columbus,” 
began his career making video 
essays on Vimeo, that other 
video sharing website that 
never fails to disappoint the 
two times a year I use it. His 
videos are always expressive 
and 
original, 
making 
him 

an important voice in film 
criticism 
today. 
Video 

essays’ rising popularity is 
an equalizer of sorts, giving 
voices to those who deserve 
more attention but lack the 
Hollywood connections.

For 
people 
looking 
to 

blow off steam and watch 
intellectually 
stimulating 

content, there’s nothing wrong 
with video essays. YouTube 
becoming plagued with video 
essayists, 
however, 
is 
off-

putting, especially considering 
the lack of gender diversity 
within the community.

Watching 
a 
movie 
and 

having an opinion is essential. 
Sharing 
these 
opinions 
is 

always 
welcome. 
Watching 

video 
essays 
instead 
and 

pretending to be an expert on 
film is nothing but obnoxious.

BOOK REVIEW
‘A Good Cry’ is a comfort

“A 
Good 
Cry” 
is 
Nikki 

Giovanni’s 21st collection of poems 
to be published, and the experience 
shows. As one of America’s 
most prolific and recognizable 
living poets, this new collection 
proves that Giovanni is settling 
into her role as senior poet with 
grace, elegance and a continued 
immediacy that makes her work 
as relevant today as it was in the 
1960s and ’70s.

The poems in “A Good Cry” are 

written in Giovanni’s signature 
style, combining the lyrical with 
the endearingly colloquial. At 
her best, she revels in simplicity: 
Simple 
language 
and 
images 

thoughtfully 
bundled 
together 

to express great complexity and 
intensity of feeling. Poems like 
“Bread,” “Thirst” and “Morning 
Breakfast Routines” elevate the 
mundane pleasures of food and 
drink to a dream-like state of 
poetry, and “On a Snowy Day” 
is an ode to the impact of small 
acts of kindness from strangers. 
The emotional backbone of this 
collection, in both its lightest and 
darkest moments, is Giovanni’s 
complete sincerity, and this makes 
each poem, no matter how simple, 
vibrate with honesty.

At times, the poems might 

falter in the direction of being 

too simple. For example, the 
acrostic “A Poem for Morris” 
and the prose poem “A Poem for 
Joanne” say nothing that hasn’t 
been said before by other writers 
in more nuanced ways. These 
poems are saved, however, by 
Giovanni’s enduring earnestness, 
her affection for the subjects 
shining through in every word. It 
would be a mistake to confuse her 
preference for simple, everyday 
subjects with an inability to cope 
with complexity and ambiguity; 

Giovanni is able to sit comfortably 
at the midline between light and 
dark, hope and hopelessness. If 
anything, her choice to write about 
seemingly 
quotidien 
subjects 

reveals an admirable lack of self-
consciousness that comes from her 
wealth of experience.

The poems in this collection 

reveal 
Giovanni’s 
thematic 

obsessions, many of which revolve 
around time, memory and age. In 
poems like “Heritage” and “If I 
Have to Hospital,” she considers 
old age with refreshing equanimity. 
In “Surveillance,” “Baby West” 
and “I Married My Mother,” she 

looks back on her childhood, and 
particularly her troubled family 
relationships, with a refusal to 
either idealize or condemn; and in 
“Rita Dove” she looks forward to 
the next generation with enduring 
hope. Giovanni also writes about 
friendship, 
particularly 
her 

friendship with fellow writer 
Maya Angelou, with an intensity 
that many poets ascribe only to 
romantic relationships, insisting 
on 
solidarity 
and 
connection 

as the most important human 
experiences. Many of the poems 
in this collection correspond with 
Giovanni’s lifetime of work as a 
civil rights activist; she views the 
Civil Rights movement as both a 
triumph and an ongoing struggle, 
making this collection an essential 
read in the current political 
climate.

The common thread running 

through 
this 
collection, 
and 

perhaps the greatest virtue of 
Giovanni’s work, is her ability to 
confront joy and tragedy in a single 
swoop. She demands connection 
in a world where we are bound 
to be isolated, and honorable 
intentions even under the worst of 
circumstances. Her message, both 
a comfort and a call-to-arms, is 
best expressed in “Introduction to 
Tim O’Brien”: “You cannot make 
the tragedy go whole / You cannot 
make the hurt heal / You can do 
nothing but embrace / The best 
within yourself.”

It looks like the Michigan football team has itself a new

against Rutgers, and he didn’t disappoint — throwing for 124 
yards and a touchdown. While Jim Harbaugh wouldn’t say Peters 
will definitively start against Minnesota, the redshirt freshman 
will still have a chance to help the Wolverines hang on to the 
Little Brown Jug.

Behind Enemy Lines: Steven Richardson

It was a tumultuous offseason 

for the Minnesota football team. 
After 10 players were suspended 
following 
an 
accusation 
of 

sexual 
assault, 
the 
team 

threatened to sit out the Holiday 
Bowl. Former head coach Tracy 
Claeys supported the boycott, 
which was eventually dropped. 
Claeys lost his job shortly after. 

In his absence stepped P.J. 

Fleck, the charismatic former 
coach of Western Michigan. 
Fleck earned a reputation for his 
off-the-wall behavior — if you’ve 
ever heard ‘Row the boat’ used 
in a motivational fashion, it’s 
thanks to him — but is also an 
accomplished coach. In his final 
year coaching the Broncos, Fleck 
led them to a 13-1 record and an 
appearance in the Cotton Bowl 
after 
an 
undefeated 
regular 

season.

His first year at Minnesota 

has seen the Golden Gophers 
struggle 
through 
conference 

play. 
Yet 
it 
was 
apparent 

after 
a 
conversation 
with 

senior defensive tackle Steven 
Richardson at Big Ten Media 
Days in July that Fleck has 
already made a positive impact 
on the program.

The 
Daily 
spoke 
with 

Richardson 
about 
the 

coaching transition, everyday 
conversations with Fleck and his 
impressions of Jim Harbaugh.

TMD: “Can you take us back 

to the first time you met him, 
when he was recruiting you (at 
Western Michigan)?”

SR: “My first impression was, 

this guy’s good. I was close to 
just saying yes, because, I mean, 
he’s very charismatic. He’s a 
very genuine coach. He says a lot 
of stuff and has a lot of phrases, 
but he backs it up all the time.”

TMD: “The previous coaching 

transition between Coach Kill 
and Coach Claeys seemed like 
it would be more seamless. Has 
it been much different going to 
Coach Fleck this summer?”

SR: “Yes. There’s just a lot 

more energy. He brought in a 
great culture that has helped 
us not just on the field but also 
off the field, too, socially. He’s 
bringing in a lot of other people 
that are helping us. We just 
learned how to cook. We learned 
how to eat dinner the right 
way — eat with the silverware 
outside-in. Just little things like 
that. It’s more than X’s and O’s 
with him.”

TMD: “How long did it take 

you to adjust to this — are you 
still adjusting now?”

SR: “There’s always growth. 

That’s what the culture brings 
in. … You’re changing every day, 
you’re growing every day. That’s 
what the culture is. I’m still 
growing right now. Coach has 

done that to me.”

Q: “Is there anything that he 

said, that you just kinda like, 
‘Did he really say that?’ ”

SR: 
“I 
can’t 
remember 

anything like that.”

Q: “What’s the funniest thing 

he’s said?”

SR: “I’m not sure. He has a 

lot of phrases. It’s like his own 
dictionary. It’s crazy. I wouldn’t 
even say that they’re funny. 
They all make sense and they all 
back up. It’s very motivational.”

TMD: “Do you find those 

phrases 
working 
themselves 

into your daily conversations 
now?”

SR: “Yeah. I will actually say 

the ‘elite’ thing threw me off. 
People ask me, ‘How are you 
doing?’ I’m like, ‘I’m good.’ Just 
a normal answer. But he was like, 
‘But what’s wrong?’ I’m like, 
‘What are you talking about? I 
just said I’m good.’ He’s like, ‘No, 
no, you didn’t say you’re elite.’ 

So it’s like, obviously have to get 
used to those kind of things, but 
there’s definitely a difference, 
and that’s what the culture has 
brought in.”

Q: “Given what transpired at 

the end of last season with the 
controversy and everything like 
that, did it almost feel like you 
guys had to go in a completely 
different 
direction 
with 
a 

different type of personality?”

SR: “Before I say anything, 

I want to say that I respect the 
coaches that I had. But I think 
it was necessary that we had to 
have the change. We’re learning 
things outside of just football. 
We’re learning socially. We’re 
learning how to treat women. 
… Like treat them as if they’re 
a queen. We’re talking about 
changing a narrative and not just 
having a stereotypical student-
athlete picture on how football 
players 
treat 
women. 
We’re 

changing the narrative to just 
becoming better men overall.”

TMD: 
“You 
guys 
played 

Michigan 
in 
2015. 
It 
was 

Harbaugh’s 
first 
year. 
Do 

you have any impression of 
Harbaugh as a coach?”

SR: “I think he’s a good 

coach. He’s a very tough coach 
to play against. That was a very 
emotional week because that’s 
when Coach Kill stepped down. 
Even though that was a really 
tough week and we still lost, 
that was still a really fun game. 
It was all the way down to the 
very last play. Going back to 
your question, he’s a really good 
coach. I respect him.”

TMD: “His antics are in the 

news often. Does that draw any 
similarities to Coach Fleck?”

SR: “I actually never thought 

about that connection, but yeah, 
I can definitely see it. How 
they’re just out there and very 
energetic coaches.”

TMD: “The way the game 

ended in 2015, does that provide 
any extra motivation when you 
guys play them this year?”

SR: “No, that’s just in the past. 

We’re going to play them like 
it’s any other game. We’re going 
to play them hard, like Coach 
talks about, changing our best. 
We’re going to play Buffalo the 
first game and that’s all we’re 
focused on.”

Daily Sports Editor

The Daily spoke with the Minnesota defensive lineman at Big Ten Media Days in July

FILE PHOTO/Daily

First-year coach P.J. Fleck will face the Wolverines for the first time in his Minnesota career Saturday night, hoping to reclaim the Little Brown Jug for the Golden Gophers.


When Sarasota, a town in 

southwestern 
Florida, 
was 

rated America’s meanest city 
in 2006, Karan Higdon was 
just a nine-year-old kid who 
wore 
size 
nine-and-a-half 

shoes. He was a big kid, no 
doubt, who went to the Boys 
and Girls Club most days after 
school and sometimes met his 
friends for kickball outside in 
the neighborhood. He played 
Pee Wee football for the Port 
Charlotte Bandits, and even 
back then he was running over 
every tackler in his path.

Todd 
Johnson, 
though, 

spent that year with the 
Chicago Bears. Then in his late 
20s, the professional defensive 
back was in his fourth season 
in 
the 
National 
Football 

League since getting drafted 
out of the University of Florida. 
After games, 
Johnson 
would 
pick 

up 
leftover 

football 
gloves 
and 

shoes 
from 

the 
Bears’ 

locker 
room 

to send back 
to Sarasota’s 
Riverview 
High School, 
his 
alma 

mater.

It 
was 

also 
the 

year Karan’s 
mother, 
Samantha 
Christian, 
decided the family should 
move out of Newtown. On the 
outskirts of Sarasota’s inner 
city, Newtown was a tight-knit 
community where everyone 
knew everyone, but it was also 
an area where you didn’t want 
to make a wrong turn.

Higdon, 
Johnson 
and 

Christian 
are 
just 
three 

characters in a bigger story of 
how one boy from Florida did 
what so many others couldn’t 
— get out. Higdon’s story is 
one of motivation, hard work 
and commitment. It’s a story 
about someone who made the 
right choices when others 
didn’t and stuck by them 
against adversity. It’s a story 

about a protagonist and a 
supporting cast that never left 
each other’s side.

This 
story 
begins 
in 

Sarasota.

***

Karan Higdon almost quit 

football when he was five 
years old. It was too hot, and 
they had him running laps. 
After one day of flag football 
with the Sarasota Redskins, 
the kindergartner decided it 
was enough.

One of the other boys’ 

fathers was the team’s coach, 
so that boy got to play running 
back. 
That’s 
how 
youth 

football teams usually worked 
— the coach’s son got to play 
a position that always got the 
ball, and if the coach had a 
nephew as well, then that kid 
might get a few runs.

The other kids, though, 

were usually just thrown in 
wherever. For Karan, that 

position 
was 

center.

Eventually, 

after 
Karan’s 

mother told him 
to “suck it up” 
and go play, one 
of the coaches 
noticed how fast 
he could run. 
So in the next 
game, 
Karan 

played running 
back, 
they 

handed 
him 

the ball and it 
was all go from 
there.

Karan 
was 

still young, but 
realized 
that 

running out in the Florida 
heat wasn’t so bad when he 
had the ball in his hands. He 
also realized that people were 
invested in him, and nobody 
more so than his mother.

Christian wanted to be 

Karan’s biggest fan and be just 
as involved in his life as her 
parents were for her, especially 
her 
mother. 
Christian’s 

mother never skipped her 
daughter’s sporting events, 
award ceremonies or parent-
teacher 
conferences. 
She 

made 
sure 
her 
daughter 

had whatever resources she 
needed to succeed.

“To see my mother sitting 

in the stands as I’m playing 

basketball or see her in the 
stands as I’m running the 100-
yard dash, it meant everything 
to me,” Christian said. “I 
didn’t care if nobody else was 
there to support me. I wanted 
my mother there.”

So when Christian became 

a mother to three boys, she 
approached parenthood the 
very same way: staying as 
involved as possible in her 
kids’ upbringing.

Growing 
up, 
Christian 

pushed Karan to be very 
active. She described him 
as bubbly, happy and always 
smiling. When he wasn’t in 
class, he was playing sports. 
He’d meet up with other 
friends in the neighborhood 
to play touch football, because 
that’s what most of the kids in 
Sarasota would do.

Christian had also grown 

up in Sarasota, though, and 
she knew all too well how easy 
it was for boys like Karan to 

get 
distracted. 
Newtown’s 

neighboring 
areas 
were 

fairly 
impoverished, 
and 

homelessness was a major 
problem for the city.

On 
certain 
streets, 

Christian always saw kids 
getting caught up by older 
guys. There were fights and 
drugs, and Christian knew 
how malleable a young boy 
growing 
up 
there 
would 

be seeing people flaunting 
around money with shiny 
jewelry and the newest pairs 
of shoes.

She 
didn’t 
want 
Karan 

seeing

dealers 

or attending a school where 
he’d hear about “so-and-so’s 
parents getting busted” and 
going to jail. She didn’t want 
Karan to get the idea that 
stealing or selling drugs was a 
productive way to go through 
life.

“I didn’t want Karan to 

get 
hypnotized 
with 
the 

fascination of that illusion of 
what a man is supposed to be,” 
Christian said.

She’d grown up in the city 

and seen it all herself.

So when Karan was nine, 

Christian moved the family 
out of the inner city to North 
Port, a neighborhood much 
further south of the county.

She wanted to make sure 

that Karan didn’t become like 
some of the people she had 
seen in Newtown, because 
as he moved up into middle 
school, 
she 
was 
starting 

to realize how significant 
football could really be for 
him.

***

When Karan was playing 

Pop Warner football at the 
age of 12, his nickname was 
“Nightmare.”

“This kid was literally a 

nightmare on the football 
field on offense and defense,” 

Christian said about her son. 
“He was just unbelievable. 
He used to carry his team on 
his shoulders. They would 
run Karan so much, that I 
was like, ‘Hey coach, don’t 
you think you need to give 
the ball to somebody else? 
You’re running him so much!’ 
But Karan was able to carry 
that load. He would average 
at least four touchdowns a 
game.”

Karan, 
too, 
started 
to 

realize how good he was.

“I was pretty big as a kid, 

compared to other kids, so I 
would just run through a lot of 
people,” he said.

High school coaches started 

paying 
attention, 
too. 
It 

became clear that wherever 
Karan went for school, he 
would go straight to varsity.

Riverview High School was 

always the likely candidate 
to land Karan. Christian had 
gone to Riverview herself, and

Karan Higdon’s Sarasota success story

TED JANES

Daily Sports Writer

Michigan’s running back saw one way out of Florida. With the help of his mother, he took it and ran.

Junior running back Karan Higdon poses with his mother, Samantha, after rushing for 200 yards and three touchdowns against Indiana this year.

I didn’t want 
Karan to get 
hypnotized 

with the 

fascination of 
that illusion of 
what a man is 
supposed to be.


Christian’s nephew, D.J., had 
played football there, so she 
and Karan often went to see his 
games. Karan was just 13 years 
old when Riverview coach 
John Sprague approached him 
and Christian to talk about his 
future.

Sprague 
had 
followed 

Karan through Pop Warner, 
and wanted him to come join 
the Rams.

“Send him to Riverview, 

Sam,” Sprague had said. “We’ll 
take good care of him.”

Riverview always had a 

great football program, and 
its coaches knew how to 
get their players ready for 
the next level. They helped 
players put together film for 
recruiting and did everything 
in their power to get players 
recognized by colleges.

Karan was the kind of 

running 
back 
Riverview 

needed, and Riverview was 
the kind of school where he 
could thrive. The coaches 
there, as Christian learned, 
cared more about their players 
than just their football talent.

“Everyone in the community 

knew, if you wanted your child 
to get a football scholarship, 
you need to send your child 
to Riverview High School,” 
Christian said.

Despite 
being 
pursued 

by almost every school in 
the area, Karan enrolled at 
Riverview.

The other schools didn’t 

stand a chance. They didn’t 
know 
Karan. 
They 
just 

knew 
him 
as 
a 
football 

player, and that’s all they 
cared about. Manatee High 
School, which won the 2011 
State Championship, heavily 
recruited him. It seemed like 
all the aspiring football players 
wanted to go to Manatee, and 
Karan had the offer waiting.

But he wasn’t interested, 

according 
to 
his 
mother, 

because what Manatee cared 
about 
most 
was 
putting 

another kid on a roster to 
try and win a championship. 
Karan’s academic and career 
goals couldn’t take a back 
seat. His dreams of being an 
orthopedic 
surgeon 
would 

get blanketed by all the 
pressure to put football first. 
That wasn’t what Karan 
wanted — Karan wanted to 
prioritize his education.

At Riverview, Karan and 

Christian knew they had 
that opportunity.

Even 
when 
Sprague 

retired from his longtime 
head-coaching job, where he 
had been for three decades, 
the plans never changed.

Sprague stepped down 

in March of Karan’s eighth 
grade year. He wouldn’t 
be 
on 
the 
sideline 
to 

coach Karan through high 
school, like he had done 
successfully for so many 
players, but Christian knew 
their decision was still 
the right one. Sprague’s 
replacement, 
after 
all, 

wanted the same thing for 
Karan as she did.

***

Over that span, as Karan 

moved 
through 
middle 

school, Todd Johnson was 
finishing up his NFL career. 
After his fourth season 
with the Bears, he signed 
a four-year contract with 
the St. Louis Rams. He had 
29 tackles in 2007, and 23 
the next season as a backup 
safety. The Rams waived 
him from the roster in 2009 
and, after a short stint in 
Buffalo, he returned home 
permanently to Sarasota.

Moving 
back 
meant 

Johnson would be much 
closer to Riverview High 
School, where he graduated 
from in 1998. As a kid, he 
dreamed of playing for the 
Riverview Rams, so when 
he went away to college 
and the NFL, he always 
made sure to come back to 
his roots. He’d work out 
with Riverview players in 
his offseasons and stayed 
connected with his former 
coach, Sprague, who had 
been with the school since 
1981.

Unfortunately, 
Johnson 

saw the same challenges 
that Samantha Christian 
had seen. He noticed them 
before he left Sarasota. He 
noticed them when he came 
back.

“I saw a ton of kids that 

were talented and gifted 
that could go on and do 
great things but didn’t make 
good decisions, made poor 
choices and therefore lost 
out on moving on,” Johnson 
said.

Whether it was falling 

behind in grades or getting 

in 
trouble 
with 
the 
law, 

it seemed that every year 
another great football player 
could do everything on the 
field, but did something wrong 
off it.

So when the opportunity 

opened up to get more involved 
at Riverview, Johnson threw 
his hat in the ring.

And 
in 
April 
of 
2011, 

Riverview named Johnson its 
new head coach. Johnson’s 
NFL career hadn’t been over 
for even two years before 
he was right back in the 
mix at the place where it all 
started for him. In his first 
press conference, he spoke 
about how important it was 
to mentor every individual, 
giving 
them 

the 
positive 

environment 
they needed 
to 
be 

successful.

He wasn’t 

taking 
this 

job 
just 
to 

win football 
games on his 
old stomping 
ground. 
He 

took 
it 
for 

the chance to 
give back.

As 
the 

summer went on and Johnson 
transitioned 
into 
his 
new 

job, more schools continued 
pursuing Karan. He was a 
popular, likeable and sought-
after football player, and the 
cutthroat Florida high school 
competition wanted to seize 
him up.

Eventually 
Johnson 

approached Karan. Rumors 
of more schools’ interests 
had circulated around, and 
Johnson wanted to check in, 
so he asked Karan what was 

going on.

“Coach, I’m a Ram from 

now until forever,” Higdon 
told him. “I will never leave 
here. I started here, and this is 
where I’m gonna finish.

“I told you that I’d be here 

for four years, and that’s not 
going to change no matter 
what.”

Nothing 
waivered 
for 

Karan. When other schools 
wanted to talk, Karan had 
none of it. He had given his 
coach his word, and stuck by 
his decision.

So Karan was committed, 

Pee Wee football was long gone 
and Pop Warner had passed. 
He was the star in those 
leagues, but if Karan wanted 

to succeed — 
which 
he 
so 

badly did — he’d 
have to be the 
star 
in 
high 

school.

“Listen 

here, 
son,” 

Christian once 
told him. “You 
are 
going 
to 

have a hundred 
Karan Higdons 
in high school. 
The 
level 
of 

competition, 
that 
bar 
has 

been raised now. You are really 
going to have to fight and show 
what you can do.”

Just as she predicted, high 

school brought about new 
challenges. Karan hadn’t been 
big on weightlifting, but in 
middle school football, that 
didn’t matter. He was so fast 
and naturally big that he could 
bulldoze through everyone 
he played against. But against 
bigger 
and 
stronger 
high 

school players, that wouldn’t 
be the case.

His 
natural 
talent 
was 

enough to put him on varsity, 
but it was in the weight room 
where he began to really learn.

“There comes a point where 

you got to grow,” Karan said. 
“You’ve got to learn how to 
perfect your craft, and I knew 
that there was going to come a 
point in time where some guys 
I’m going to have to make miss 
and some guys I’m going to 
have to run through.”

High school was that point 

for him. Johnson and the rest 
of Riverview’s staff worked on 
everything with Karan, and he 
ate it all up. They taught him 
how to juke his opponents, 
how to lift right and how to be 
more explosive.

Sometimes he’d use less 

weight 
when 
he 
bench-

pressed, bring the weight 
down slow, and then explode 
up. For squats and leg presses, 
he did the same thing.

While other kids were out 

elsewhere, Karan was in the 
weight room. When he wasn’t 
there, he was on the football 
field. If he wasn’t there, he was 
studying. He was doing it all, 
and doing all of it really, really 
well. 

By the time his first varsity 

game came around, Karan, 
Christian and Johnson all 
knew that he was ready for 
this next step.

Everybody 
else 
quickly 

found out.

In 
a 
game 
between 

Riverview and Booker High 
School, the coaches called a 
run play for him.

Karan took the ball and 

darted 
forward 
before 

lowering his shoulder to truck 
through 
Booker 
defensive 

back Ricky Jones Jr.

on Twitter during
Saturday’s game.

Jones, a senior All-American 

who went on to play as a 
wide 
receiver 
at 
Indiana, 

was knocked flat onto his 
back. He was one of the area’s 
top recruits, and Karan — a 
freshman — ran him straight 
over, and everybody had seen 
it. It was in that moment that 
everybody knew this freshman 
belonged on varsity.

Karan’s 
upward 
trend 

only continued. He carried a 
4.0 GPA in high school and 
dominated on the football field. 
With Johnson’s guidance and 
his mother’s support, he was 
thriving at Riverview.

One 
of 
his 
teammates, 

though, couldn’t say the same.

“There’s always one kid in the 

bunch,” Christian recounted.

This one kid was a wide 

receiver on Karan’s team, and 
as Christian said, “probably 
could’ve gone anywhere in the 
country to play 
football.” 
Too 

many 
people 

got caught up 
wondering 
where he’d play 
Division I or 
what NFL team 
he’d get drafted 
to, and nobody 
paid attention 
to 
what 
was 

really going on.

Come 
time 

for graduation, the receiver’s 
grades had tanked and his 
SAT scores weren’t sufficient. 
He had to attend community 
college in an effort to boost his 
grades, but that year passed 
him by, and eventually his 
motivation waned.

“It went from, ‘I can go to any 

school in the United States and 
play Division I football’ to ‘Now 
I go to a community college for 
remediation. You know, forget 
school, I’ll never see myself on 
the football field again. I just 
want to be a rapper,’ ” Christian 
remembered 
about 
Karan’s 

teammate.

It was an unfortunate trend, 

and one Christian had seen 
time and time again. Parents 
got too focused on getting 
kids to the next level that 
they didn’t recognize when a 
child struggled to barely make 
minimum grades.

“It’s sad,” Christian said. 

“It’s very sad to see that happen 
to some of these children. They 
get lost in the system.”

But Karan wasn’t one of them. 

In a system that could’ve held 
him down — a system where 
giving into his environment 
would’ve been such an easy 
choice — Karan kept moving up.

“It was very apparent that 

Karan 
wasn’t 
going 
to 
let 

anything 
get 
in 
the 
way,” 

Johnson said.

That’s because Karan just 

kept plugging away. He kept 
being 
friendly 
to 
people, 

making good choices and living 
the life his mother was dead set 
on creating for him.

He became the ambassador 

for a football program that 
had given so much for its 
community.

And after high school, Karan 

came to Michigan. Three years 
later, now, he still thinks about 
all those people when he runs 
for 100 and 200-yard games for 
the Wolverines.

He plays for his family, his 

former coaches and Riverview 
teammates, all of the people 
that haven’t made it out of the 

system 
and 
all 

the kids back in 
Sarasota 
who 

someday hope to 
be just like him. 

“I’m 
running 

for more than just 
myself,” 
Karan 

says. 
“It’s 
more 

than just me when 
I play this game.”

He rushes head 

on 
at 
tacklers 

because he has a 

legacy to carry. He goes back 
to Sarasota and hosts football 
camps, because he wants to see 
those kids have the opportunity 
to succeed. Karan runs so 
hard, because if he hadn’t, he 
wouldn’t be where he is today 
— a junior at Michigan, and the 
Wolverines’ leading running 
back.

And Karan does it all for 

his mom, because if she hadn’t 
believed in him, he might not 
have either. If not for football 
and the support he found at 
Riverview, Karan might have 
been no different than those 
people his mom pushed him so 
hard to surpass.

“In Florida, it’s the way out,” 

he said. “I just take that each 
and every time I take the field,” 
he said.

He 
runs 
harder 
than 

everyone else because he has 
bigger goals and bigger dreams. 
Karan Higdon wants to write 
his own story, and so every 
play, he runs a little bit harder, 
because his story isn’t over yet.

It’s very sad to 
see that happen 
to some of these 

children.

What to Watch For: Minnesota

Here we go again. For the 

second time this season, the 
Wolverines will be hosting a 
night game at Michigan Stadium 
with a trophy on the line. 

The last time, as you know, 

didn’t go so well for Michigan. 
Amidst a torrential downpour, 
fifth-year senior quarterback 
John 
O’Korn 
threw 
three 

interceptions 
en 
route 
to 

Michigan State’s upset over the 
Wolverines.

Then again, a lot has changed 

since then. Michigan appears 
to have a new quarterback in 
Brandon Peters. The offensive 
line issues that plagued the 
Wolverines against the Spartans 
appear, at least in part, to have 
been solved, and Michigan’s 
backfield has reaped the benefits 
— coming off a performance 
against Rutgers that featured 
two 100-yard rushers in Ty 
Isaac and Karan Higdon.

Minnesota, in its own right, 

boasts a threatening run attack 
with a mobile quarterback to 
go with it. The Golden Gophers 
have pieces in place to threaten 
to reclaim the Little Brown Jug, 
and did I mention there’s an 
80-percent chance of rain?

Here’s what to watch for 

when Michigan faces Minnesota 
and its first-year head coach P.J. 
Fleck:

1. Is this officially Brandon 

Peters’ job?

The 
redshirt 
freshman 

quarterback 
finally 
saw 

legitimate 
playing 
time 

against 
Rutgers, 
replacing 

O’Korn midway through the 
second quarter. He didn’t fail 
to impress, finishing with 10 
completions on 14 attempts for 
124 yards and a touchdown.

After the game, Jim Harbaugh 

acknowledged 
that 
Peters 

likely 
exceeded 
everyone’s 

expectations — including his 
own. He went on to say he was 
optimistic about his new man 
under center, even seemingly 
suggesting that this is now 
Peters’ job to lose.

“Right now, I feel really good 

about the way that (Peters) 
played,” Harbaugh said, “and 
feel good about him taking the 
next step and being the starting 
quarterback and having a great 
week of now knowing he’s 
the 
starting 
quarterback 
in 

practice.”

On 
Monday, 
however, 

Harbaugh seemed to pump the 
breaks a bit, saying he would 
not name a starter and that the 
Wolverines would prepare both 
Peters and O’Korn. But he did 
state that it was “likely” Peters 
would receive his first starting 
nod — placing his chances at “51 
percent”.

If one thing is definitive 

though, it’s that Peters will play. 
Harbaugh made that much clear.

It’s just a question of if he gets 

his first college start under the 
lights against Minnesota.

2. 
Can 
Minnesota’s 
run 

game 
best 
Michigan’s 

defense?

The Wolverines love to bring 

the pressure, to say the least. 
The only problem is that the 
Golden Gophers may be able to 
counteract it.

“They’re gonna run the rock,” 

said defensive coordinator Don 
Brown. “Their mantra you can 
tell is big, strong — I think the 
best offensive line we’ve played 
to this point in terms of run 
blocking. They’ve got multiple 
running backs that can carry 
the load. We’ve gotta do a great 
job in controlling the run game, 
and then obviously doing a good 
job on third down from our 
standpoint.”

In large part, as Brown alluded 

to, that production rests on the 
trio of Rodney Smith, Shannon 
Brooks 
and 
Kobe 
McCrary. 

Brooks and McCrary boast five 
touchdowns each, while Smith 
appears to be the workhorse back 
— turning 153 carries into an 
average of 78.4 yards per game.

Minnesota averages 4.1 yards 

per carry on the ground and 
boasts 13 rushing touchdowns, 
and it’s the first Big Ten team 
Michigan has encountered with 
with a top-50 rush offense.

Breakdown: ‘M’ 
has a slight edge

For just the fifth time in 

program history, the Michigan 
football team will be playing a 
night game in Ann Arbor. The 
Wolverines didn’t have to wait 
very long since the last one.

A 
month 
ago, 
Michigan 

lost a sloppy tilt with now-
No. 24 Michigan State amid a 
torrential downpour, and had 
to watch the Spartans walk off 
its field with the Paul Bunyan 
Trophy. Saturday night, there 
will be another trophy on the 
line.

Michigan (3-2 Big Ten, 6-2 

overall) 
will 
be 
facing 
off 

against Minnesota (1-4, 4-4) 
for the Little Brown Jug, which 
the Wolverines claimed after 
beating the Golden Gophers two 
years ago thanks to a goal-line 
stand with seconds remaining 
on the clock in Minneapolis.

Here’s 
how 
Michigan 

matches up with Minnesota on 
Saturday night.

Michigan pass offense vs 

Minnesota pass defense

Whether coach Jim Harbaugh 

and his staff choose to admit it 
publicly or not, Brandon Peters 
will be the leader under center 
for the foreseeable future. The 
redshirt freshman quarterback 
took full advantage of his first 
taste of meaningful game action 
last week, putting a 10-for-
14, 124-yard, one-touchdown 
performance on his resume.

While he didn’t light up 

Rutgers, Peters settled into the 
groove of the offense and did 
what the Wolverines needed 
him to do to turn the game 
around. 
From 
his 
quiet 

confidence to his poise in the 
pocket, Peters impressed his 
teammates 
and 
coaches 

See BREAKDOWN, Page 8

All in all, Brown isn’t speaking 

in hyperbole.

The Wolverines have a test 

waiting for them Saturday. Only 
time will tell if the defensive unit 
is capable of passing that test.

3. Can Ambry Thomas take a 

kick to the house?

Michigan’s 
freshman 

defensive 
back 
debuted 
as 

the Wolverines’ kick returner 
against Purdue. He admitted 
that 
the 
responsibility 
was 

intimidating at first, but has 
since embraced the role.

Entering the matchup with 

Minnesota, 
Thomas 
is 
now 

averaging just over 25 yards per 
return. Equipped with speed 
that Thomas himself says can 
stack up with the best in the 
nation, he has flashed an ability 
to make big plays on special 
teams.

Last Saturday is the perfect 

example. 
After 
bobbling 
a 

kickoff against Rutgers, Thomas 
took off — weaving his way 
downfield before being tripped 
up from behind near the 37-yard 

line with open space in front of 
him.

He subsequently drew a delay 

of game for spiking the ball — 
something he jokingly justified 
by saying that he was one man 
away from breaking loose to the 
end zone for the third straight 
week.

At the end of the day, Thomas 

hasn’t had a highlight reel return, 
at least not yet. Special teams 
coordinator Chris Partridge said 
last week that the Wolverines 
are close. Thomas echoed that 
sentiment this week. But the 
missed opportunities still linger 
in his mind.

“Everyday, literally, I picture 

it,” he said Tuesday. “It’s gonna 
happen real soon, hopefully a big 
game.”

And 
with 
the 
Wolverines 

playing their second game under 
the lights, Thomas may get 
the big-game return he’s been 
imagining.

4. 
Will 
Minnesota 

implement the direct snap?

If 
there 
has 
been 
one 

consistent issue plaguing this 
Michigan defense, it’s direct-
snap plays.

Then-No. 2 Penn State went 

to it early and often in State 
College. On the second play of 
the game, Saquon Barkley took 
a direct snap 69 yards to the end 
zone.

A week later, Rutgers wide 

receiver Janarion Grant went 
to the formation again, making 
Michigan pay with a 65-yard 
touchdown run of his own.

With a trio of backs all with 

a pension for the big play, 
Minnesota could try to expose 
the Wolverines again. And if 
the Golden Gophers’ backfield 
doesn’t do it, quarterback Demry 
Croft might.

Minnesota hasn’t shied away 

from letting Croft run the ball, 
as 
the 
redshirt 
sophomore 

boasts 36 carries for 196 yards 
— highlighted by a 64-yard 
touchdown run against Oregon 
State.

Brown 
will 
surely 
be 

preparing Michigan’s defense for 
the formation, as he said Grant’s 
touchdown was the one play that 
“irks the hell” out him.

But until the Wolverines prove 

capable of stopping it, every 
team they face will be tempted 
to replicate the success on the 
direct snap.

as 
well 
as 
the 
Michigan 

faithful. 
He 
may 
have 

jumpstarted 
the 
Wolverines’ 

struggling offense last Saturday, 
but he needs to show that he can 
have that much of an impact on a 
regular basis.

Peters will have his work 

cut out for him in a matchup 
against the Golden Gophers’ 
20th-ranked defense. In eight 
games, Minnesota has given up 
just eight touchdowns through 
the air. It has also allowed an 
average of 114 passing yards 
per game, which is 10 less than 
Peters gained last Saturday. 
While Peters has yet to throw 
an 
interception, 
the 
Golden 

Gophers have forced eight and 
returned them for 98 yards.

Peters is bound to face some 

bumps in the road eventually. 
They might come sooner than 
expected Saturday night.

It’s not every day that a ground

back rotation. Junior Karan 
Higdon and fifth-year senior Ty 
Isaac both eclipsed 100 yards 
rushing, and Higdon teamed 
up 
with 
redshirt 
freshman 

Kareem Walker to score three 
touchdowns.

As 
far 
as 
Michigan 
is 

concerned, it was no fluke. 
After 
starting 
the 
season 

with 
concerning 
flaws, 
the 

offensive line has been on the 
mend according to fifth-year 
senior Patrick Kugler. With a 
mentality to open up holes for 

the Wolverines’ talented backs, 
Kugler and his unit have worked 
to resolve the little mistakes that 
plagued them for much of the 
year.

Regardless, Minnesota will 

provide 
a 
more 
challenging 

test 
than 
they 
have 
faced. 

The Golden Gophers’ trio of 
linebackers, 
Thomas 
Barber, 

Jonathan Celestin, and Carter 
Coughlin, have the ability to 
wreak havoc in stopping the 
run. Barber leads the team with 
75 tackles, Coughlin leads with 
8.5 
tackles-for-loss 
and 
4.5 

sacks, and Celestin has both an 
interception return and fumble 
recovery.

The 
running 
backs 
and 

offensive line had their best 
outing against Rutgers, and that 
momentum should be enough 
to push them past Minnesota’s 
tough front.

Minnesota pass offense vs 

Michigan pass defense

More often than not, operating 

an offense with two different 
quarterbacks is a recipe for 
disaster. Despite relatively solid 
numbers 
from 
Minnesota’s 

Conor Rhoda and Demry Croft, 
the Golden Gophers are no 
exception.

Minnesota has one of the 

worst offenses in the nation, 
ranking 110th nationally in total 
offense. Rhoda and Croft have 
combined for 1,251 yards and just 
nine touchdowns in eight games 
played. They should be grateful 
to have a target like receiver 
Tyler Johnson, who has caught 
31 passes for 591 yards and seven 
of those scores.

Michigan, 
on 
the 
other 

hand, has one of the best pass 
defenses in the country. Ranked 
as the fifth-best unit in passing 
efficiency, 
the 
Wolverines’ 

secondary has held opponents to 
just six total scores this season. 
While their individual statistics 
might not stand out as much, the 
chemistry of the back four has 
been a strength for Michigan.

Whichever quarterback takes 

the field will have a hard time 
breaking through the defense in 
the air.

Edge: Michigan
Minnesota run offense vs 

Michigan run defense

As is the case with the 

Wolverines, 
Minnesota’s 
run 

game is the dominant offensive 
unit. And it has a trio of backs 
of its own in Rodney Smith, 
Shannon 
Brooks 
and 
Kobe 

McCrary.

The three have combined for 

12 touchdowns, with Brooks 
and McCrary coming up with 
five each. Smith is the lead back, 
though, as he has received the 
vast majority of carries with 153. 
Together, they have helped the 
Golden Gophers rank in the top-
50 nationally with an average of 
182 yards per game.

Despite Minnesota’s strength 

in this area, Michigan has a 
strength of its own, too. The 
Wolverines’ 
defensive 
line 

has 
only 
improved 
as 
the 

season has progressed, with 
the combination of fifth-year 
senior tackle Maurice Hurst 
and sophomore defensive end 
Rashan Gary continually causing 
fits for opposing offenses.

As good as Michigan’s front 

four is, it may not be able to 
contain 
Minnesota’s 
running 

back trio, though.

Special teams
It hasn’t been the best of times 

for redshirt freshman kicker 
Quinn Nordin.

After missing a PAT against 

Penn State amid rousing boos 
for the one-time Nittany Lion 
commit, Nordin missed another 
kick against Rutgers — this 
time, a 37-yard field goal. He 

is still 14-for-17 on the year, 
which is good for an 80-percent 
completion rate, but his recent 
string of games hasn’t been the 
most encouraging.

Nordin will be up against 

a kicker with a comparable 
record in Golden Gopher Emmit 
Carpenter, who is 11-for-15 — a 
73.3 completion percentage.

In a game that could turn out 

to be closer than expected, one 
of these two kickers might play a 
role in the decision.

Edge: Push
Intangibles
While it may not have been 

long since Michigan’s last home 
night game, it has been a long 
time since the Wolverines played 
host to Minnesota. They won’t 
want to remember it.

In the midst of Michigan’s 

catastrophic 5-7 season back in 
2014, the Golden Gophers came 
away with a 30-14 victory. That 
was all before Harbaugh took 
over the program.

Under 
his 
watch, 
the 

Wolverines brought the Little 
Brown Jug back to Ann Arbor in 
2015. They won’t want to give up 
another trophy.
