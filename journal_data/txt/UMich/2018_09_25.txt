STUDENT LIFE

University President Mark 

Schlissel sat down with The 
Daily Monday morning to talk 
about recent developments on 
sexual misconduct training 
and 
investigations 
at 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan, 

voting 
laws 
in 
Michigan, 

recommendations to change 
the current Regent investment 
protocols and more.

Sexual 

Misconduct 
Data 
and 

Sixth 
Circuit 
Court 
Ruling

The 

recent 
Sexual 
Misconduct 

Report from the Office for 
Institutional Equity, released 
in early September, shows 
an increase in reported cases 
of sexual misconduct, even 
while the number of case 
investigations dropped.

Schlissel said he interprets 

the number as a sign that the 
rate of reporting is increasing, 
and credited the #MeToo 
movement 
and 
broader 

societal change for increased 
willingness to report.

“In general, it’s actually a 

good thing that the number of 

incidents reported is going 

up,” 
Schlissel 

said. 
“The 

incidence 
of 
this 

conduct 
is 

intolerably 

high, but 

the 

frequency of reporting is far 
lower. So, it’s a good thing, and 
I think it’s a product of some 
of the educational campaigns 
we’re doing on campus but 
also heightened sensitivity and 
awareness of misconduct in the 
broader society.”

Schlissel 
said 
there 
are 

several reasons for the reduced 
number of investigations. He 
noted the University doesn’t 
have 
jurisdiction 
in 
cases 

that don’t involve students or 
faculty at the University — in 
which case a report is filed 
and the case is referred to the 
Ann Arbor Police Department 
— 
and 
said 
complainants 

sometimes 
choose 
not 
to 

pursue 
investigations 
into 

reported misconduct.

“We’re going to continue 

to try to get everyone who 
feels as if they’ve been treated 
inappropriately to step forward 
and ask for help,” Schlissel 
said. “And then we’ll work 
with them to figure out the 

Amid 

national 
uproar 
following 

multiple allegations of sexual 
assault against Supreme Court 
nominee 
Brett 
Kavanaugh, 

students and faculty at the 
University of Michigan campus 
are 
protesting 
and 
finding 

ways to discuss the issue, how 
it pertains to campus climate 
and its relevance in national 
discourse.

After 
first 

sending 
several 
anonymous 

tips to U.S. Rep. Anna Eshoo, 
D-Calif., 
and 
Sen. 
Dianne 

Feinstein, D-Calif., Christine 
Blasey Ford, a professor at 
Palo 
Alto 
University, 
came 

out 
publicly 
in 
September 

with 
details 
regarding 

Kavanaugh’s alleged attempt of 
sexual assault when the two of 
them were high school students. 
Kavanaugh 
allegedly 
pinned 

Ford to a bed, groped her and 
when she resisted and tried to 
scream, he put his hand over 
her mouth. Ford has provided 
notes telling the same story from 
a couple’s therapy session in 
2012, as well as individual 

therapy 

in 2013 and results from a 
polygraph test she passed in 
which she detailed the incident.

In 
a 
statement 
released 

through the White House last 
Monday, 
Kavanaugh 
denied 

the accusation and claimed no 
memory of this incident or Ford 
herself.

“This is a completely false 

allegation,” Kavanaugh said. “I 
have never done anything like 
what the accuser describes — to 
her or to anyone. Because this 
never happened, I had no idea 
who was making this accusation 

until 
she 
identified 
herself 

yesterday.”

Deborah 
Ramirez, 
a 

woman 
who 
attended 
Yale 

University 
with 
Kavanaugh, 

came forward yesterday with 
her 
own 
allegationsagainst 

Kavanaugh.

Democratic lawmakers are 

calling for a more in-depth 
investigation of the allegations 
set forth by Ford. President 
Donald Trump also weighed 
in on the issue, emphasizing 
Kavanaugh’s 
“impeccable 

reputation” and his doubt in the 

allegation because 

of the 

lack of a police report and time 
passed from the alleged assault.

In response, Twitter saw a 

surge of tweets with the hashtag 
#WhyIDidntReport, 
detailing 

the shame and difficulty people 
had faced in reporting their own 
sexual assault.

LSA 
senior 
Sarah 
Saks-

Fithian, a volunteer at Sexual 
Assault 
Prevention 
and 

Awareness Center, emphasized 
the difficulty for survivors of 
sexual 
assault 
to 
overcome 

trauma amid media and the 
internet opinion that criticizes 
victims for not coming forward 

sooner. 

According 
to 
Saks-Fithian, 

victims begin to feel their 
experience 
is 
invalid. 
More 

locally, she underscored the 
importance 
of 
organizations 

on campus such as the Peer-led 
Support Group program through 
SAPAC, which supports and 
advocates for survivors of sexual 
assault.

“I think that the Kavanaugh 

case affects survivors on campus

highly 
publicized

sexual 

violence

best way forward with the goal 
of reducing this to as low a level 
as possible, if not zero.”

Schlissel also spoke about 

the recent ruling by the 6th U.S. 
Circuit Court of Appeals stating, 
in cases of sexual misconduct, 
universities 
must 
give 
the 

accused student or an attorney 
an opportunity to cross-examine 
the accuser in a hearing. Court 
filings obtained by the Detroit 
Free Press show the University 
argued 
for 
a 
third 
party 

mediator, but the extent to which 
misconduct investigations will 
change remains unclear. 

“(The 
University) 
is 
no 

longer contesting whether the 
investigative model they have 
used to date is sufficient, and 
understand 
that 
they 
must 

provide students in Title IX cases 
with a live hearing including 
cross-examination,” the filing 
reads. 

Schlissel 
expressed 
his 

concern about the ruling and 
stated the University is working 
to accommodate complainants 
as well as possible.

“We are concerned that a 

procedure that requires a person 
who is bringing a complaint to 
confront the person who they 
think is responsible for an act 
of misconduct may really have a 
very difficult effect on people’s 
willingness to step forward and 
seek help and bring a complaint,” 
Schlissel said. “So, we’re looking 
for ways that will allow us to 
satisfy the requirements of the 
court ruling, to allow some kind 
of hearing, but to do it in a way 
that is as sensitive as possible 
to all of the parties who are 
involved in the complaint.”

Schlissel 
stated 
the 

University is approaching the 
court to ask for clarification and 
find out if other proposed cross-
examination 
methods 
will 

legally fit with the ruling.

Investment Considerations
Last August, the University 

announced 
the 
University’s 

Board 
of 
Regents 
will 

consider 
moving 
investment 

decisions currently in the public 
board meetings to the investment 
offices after a recommendation 
from 
an 
independent 

review 
by 
accounting 
firm 

PricewaterhouseCoopers. 
According to Schlissel, this 
is only a suggestion that the 
board will consider, not an 
actual action item that will be 
implemented.

These suggestions come after 

months of reporting, originally 
published in the Detroit Free 
Press, claiming the University 
has invested up to $4 billion of its 
$11 billion endowment into the 
global properties of the largest 
University donors including real 
estate developer Stephen Ross, 
investor Sandy Robertson and 
businessman Sam Zell. The 
Free Press also reported Regent 
Andrea 
Fischer 
Newman 

(R) accepted campaign funds 
from 
donors 
who 
receive 

investments from the University. 
Schlissel 
and 
University 

statements have denied these 
claims.

In an effort to clarify the 

role of the Investment Advisory 
Committee, 
Schlissel 
said 

the committee would use its 
financial background to help 
the University make better 
investment decisions in the 
future.

“They’re largely alums … 

who are leaders in all different 
sectors 
of 
the 
investment 

work,” 
Schlissel 
said. 
“We 

discuss what we think future 
trends are in different types 
of 
investments. 
We 
don’t 

discuss specific investments … 
These are volunteers and the 
expertise they bring to the table 
is just enormously valuable, so 
we need to model our future 
budget and to do that, we 
need good predictions of how 
much money the endowment 
is going to earn and this group 
helps us think about what 
reasonable 
expectations 
are. 

It’s 
remarkable 
service 
by 

volunteer alumni basically.”

Currently, 
the 
board 

hears and approves specific 
investments in the monthly 
meetings and suggests regents 

be removed from voting due 
to conflicts of interest. In the 
proposed revision to meeting 
agenda, the board would vote on 
broad investment decisions and 
allow private committees to act 
on these recommendations and 
make investments themselves.

Schlissel 
said 
this 

change, 
proposed 
by 

PricewaterhouseCoopers 
and 

not guaranteed to be enacted, 
would bring the University up to 
speed with common investment 
practices at other institutions.

“(PricewaterhouseCoopers 

said) other universities like 
us, the boards of regents or the 
boards of trustees don’t vote 
on 
individual 
investments,” 

Schlissel said. “The level of 
professional expertise that it 
takes to figure out whether 
a particular investment is a 
good one is really complicated. 
We hire professionals in our 
investment office to do that 
so that was a suggestion made 
by the PWC people and we’ll 
consider it … The PWC folks 
pointed out that we’re an 
outlier and they don’t know of 
other universities that vote on 
individual investments on the 
Board.”

In regard to the image of 

moving a public decision to a 
private 
committee, 
Schlissel 

claimed 
it 
wouldn’t 
affect 

the University’s openness on 
investment decisions.

“We 
currently 
provide 

a report every year on the 
University’s investments and 
that’s all public and that’s a 
normal 
practice,” 
Schlissel 

said. “It wouldn’t be a change 
in transparency because these 
things are already reported on 
an annual basis.”

Financial Aid Programs
According 
to 
the 
Office 

of 
Financial 
Aid, 
the 

University cost of attendance for 
in-state students is $30,298 
and $64,386 for out-of-state 
students. 
When 
discussing 

other leading institutions like 
New York University’s medical 
school covering tuition for all 
of its students and Stanford 
University 
covering 
tuition 

for all students whose income 

is below $125,000, Schlissel 
focused 
on 
Michigan’s 

prominent 
aid 
program 

— the Go Blue Guarantee.

The Go Blue Guarantee 

covers tuition for in-state 
students 
whose 
income 

is 
below 
$65,000. 

Schlissel said this is a big 
accomplishment for a public 
university.

“We are, as far as I know, 

the first public university 
ever to make a guarantee of 
four years of free tuition and 
fees for half of the families 
in the state of Michigan,” 
Schlissel said.

Schlissel 
added 

universities like Stanford 
University 
or 
Harvard 

University that have the 
financial capacity to grant 
more aid is beneficial for 
their 
students. 
For 
the 

University of Michigan, on 
the other hand, he said the 
Go Blue Guarantee does 
good work.

“What 
Michigan 
has 

done (with the Go Blue 
Guarantee), to me, it’s the 
thing I’m proudest out of 

everything I’ve accomplished 
since I’ve been here,” Schlissel 
said.

For 
out-of-state-students, 

Schlissel said the University 
meets 
the 
federally-

calculated 
financial 
need, 

based on the FAFSA. He said 
the University would like to 
help more students attend but 
will prioritize in-state families 
with programs like the Go Blue 
Guarantee.

“I would love to be able to 

do corresponding things for 
other populations of people, 
but our first responsibility as a 
Michigan public university is to 
the members of our community 
here in the state,” Schlissel said.

Schlissel said other public 

universities 
are 
following 

the University’s example and 
expanding financial aid budgets 
and programs to make college 
more affordable.

“Ohio has copied us, Illinois is 

copying us, and I think that’s a 
wonderful thing,” Schlissel said.

Michigan Voting Laws
The University of Michigan 

and Michigan State University’s 
chapters of College Democrats 
recently filed a lawsuit against 
the 
Michigan 
Secretary 
of 

State over what they see as 
unnecessarily restrictive state 
voting laws, bringing renewed 
attention on campus to voting 
accessibility.

Schlissel was instrumental 

in starting the Big Ten Voting 
Challenge, an initiative aimed 
at increasing voter registration 
and turnout at Big Ten schools. 
After hearing the idea, originally 
proposed for just the University 
of Michigan, Schlissel wrote 
the other 13 Big Ten university 
presidents 
and 
proposed 
a 

contest for the greatest increase 
in the percentage of registered 
voters and the biggest campus 
turnout. The others responded 
positively 
and 
began 
the 

initiative.

Schlissel 
expects 
campus 

turnout to be much higher than 
in previous elections and lauded 
the recent public focus on voting 
at the University.

“Anything that makes it more 

difficult to exercise the right 
to vote — I think you have to 
be enormously careful about,” 
Schlissel 
said. 
“And 
what 

we’re trying to do is encourage 
all Michigan students to get 
registered, whether it’s here 
in the state or their home state 
— and to vote. … I’m really 
optimistic that the turnout is 
going to be much greater than 
it has been in recent elections 
because of all the focus on this. 
It’s much better to participate 
in the process than to complain 
about elections.”

Schlissel also addressed the 

possibility of not holding classes 
on Election Day, as mentioned 
by CSG President Daniel Greene 
at the board meeting last 
week. In the short term, the 
administration 
has 
asked 

faculty to be mindful of the date 
and try not to schedule exams or 
events on that date.

Schlissel has also discussed 

canceling classes on Election 
Day and making up the lost class 
time by shortening Fall Break 
by one day, an idea that has 
seen a mixed reception among

and that they can be very 
triggering and disruptive to 
survivors’ 
healing,” 
Saks-

Fithian said. “Trauma tends 
to hover close to the surface, 
and it can be very triggering 
when survivors are bombarded 
by stimuli related to their 
experiences. 
As 
a 
survivor 

myself, I know that I become 
more emotionally vulnerable 
when 
I‘m 
continually 

exposed to stories of sexual 
violence, especially in such 
highly publicized cases like 
Kavanaugh’s because there’s 
really no way to avoid it.”

Saks-Fithian 
also 

highlighted 
how 
issues 
in 

society are reflected in the 
University campus community, 
and public figures should be 
held to higher moral standards 
of 
behavior. 
Saks-Fithian 

made the distinction between 
limiting Kavanaugh’s career 
opportunities and ruining his 
life.

“The 
Kavanaugh 
case 
is 

extremely 
relevant 
for 
our 

campus community and for 
the world because it involves 
someone trying to join the 
highest echelons of legal power 
that exist in our country,” she 
explained. “I find it interesting 
that people are focusing on 
the impact these allegations 
may 
have 
on 
Kavanaugh’s 

career 
without 
taking 
into 

account the impact the assault 

has had on the survivor. The 
impact of sexual violence is 
not limited to memories of the 
experience(s). 
The 
violation 

of bodily autonomy, agency 
and 
independence 
have 

consequences that are often 
widespread and long-lasting 
and can and often do completely 
alter the survivor’s life.”

This situation has made some 

question the legitimacy of the 
Supreme Court nominations 
process, a conflict stemming in 
part from Republicans’ blocking 
of former President Barack 
Obama’s 
nominee 
Merrick 

Garland 
as 
a 
replacement 

for former Justice Antonin 
Scalia. 
Senate 
Republicans 

refused to hold any hearings 
on 
Garland’s 
nomination 

and 
successfully 
appointed 

and confirmed Justice Neil 
Gorsuch in 2017 under the 
Trump 
administration. 

In 
addition, 
Kavanaugh’s 

confirmation would make him 
the second sitting Supreme 
Court justice, including Justice 
Clarence Thomas, accused of 
sexual misconduct. 

Michigan 
Law 
Professor 

Richard Primus weighed in 
on the issue, describing the 
implications of this case and 
how it relates to the hearings 
regarding 
the 
accusations 

against Thomas by attorney 
Anita Hill.

“The 
Kavanaugh 

confirmation 
hearings 
are 

turning out to be potentially the 
most explosive and damaging 
confirmation hearings in the 

history of the Supreme Court. 
Many 
people 
are 
drawing 

parallels 
to 
the 
Clarence 

Thomas 
hearings 
in 
1991,” 

Primus wrote in an email to The 
Daily. “But in 1991, there was a 
much higher degree of trust and 
cooperation between the rival 
political parties in Congress, 
and in 1991 the President who 
nominated the candidate was 
not himself famous for bragging 
about 
committing 
sexual 

assaults.”

Primus 
explained 
the 

importance of accountability 
within the Supreme Court in 
order to preserve its status as 
an institution that exercises fair 
judicial proceedings.

“It’s a mistake to think 

that the Supreme Court is 
permanently and automatically 
a respected institution whose 
rulings the other branches are 
willing to respect,” he wrote. 
“It took the Court a hundred 
years after the Constitution 
was ratified to accumulate the 
capital necessary to exercise 
judicial 
review 
of 
federal 

legislation on a regular basis. 
In large part because of the 
stonewall of Merrick Garland, 
the Court’s stature was already 
wobbling before the current 
sexual assault allegations came 
out. If things go badly now, 
the Court might face a rough 
future.”

Primus 
emphasized 
the 

importance 
of 
sensitivity 

regarding the issue because of 
its wide-reaching impacts on all 
women who have experienced 

sexual assault.

“No matter what happens to 

the Court, the process is taking 
a serious toll on many women 
who have been victims of sexual 
violence and who are finding the 
intense public discussion of the 
current allegations particularly 
difficult,” he wrote. “Very few 
of us have direct contact with 
the confirmation process, but 
probably all of us have contact 
with someone who is having a 
hard time because of the way 
current events intersect with 
her personal experience. We 
should be thoughtful about 
being sensitive to that reality as 
events unfold.” 

The Coalition to Defend 

Affirmative Action, Integration 
& Immigrant Rights and Fight 
for Equality By Any Means 
Necessary, 
also 
known 
as 

BAMN, held a protest on the 
Diag Monday afternoon calling 
for the removal of Trump from 
office and the subsequent defeat 
of Kavanaugh’s nomination.

Kate 
Stenvig, 
a 
national 

organizer with BAMN and 
chair of BAMN’s U-M chapter, 
explained the mission of the 
protest.

“We believe Christine Ford, 

and now Deborah Ramirez,” 
Stenvig said. “The nomination 
of Brett Kavanaugh now to the 
Supreme Court is a real threat 
to democracy, and to the rights 
of women, and because Trump 
has chosen Kavanaugh because 
of his longstanding position 
that a sitting president should 
be above the law. I think it’s 

been clear from the beginning 
that Trump’s whole platform 
and his whole support base 
is 
fundamentally 
based 
on 

misogyny, immigrant bashing 
and racism.”

Stenvig 
described 
Trump 

and Kavanaugh as unfit for 
their 
government 
positions, 

citing the separation of migrant 
children from their families, 
which became a topic of national 
discussion this summer.

“Trump has proven to be the 

abuser-in-chief: his promotion 
of sexual assault and predation 
of women, the fact that he has 
committed 
massive 
crimes 

against humanity by already 
using national security as the 
premise for separating children 
from their families and putting 
children in cages, while denying 
immigrants the basic right 
of applying for asylum which 
is their legal right,” she said. 
“Nobody, neither Trump nor 
Kavanaugh, who are abusers, 
should be in the position to be 
able to make decisions over our 
lives.”

Rackham 
student 
Kate 

Napier 
protested 
alongside 

BAMN 
and 
explained 
she 

felt the accusations against 
Kavanaugh 
automatically 

disqualified 
him 
from 
the 

Supreme Court.

“Brett Kavanaugh is not fit to 

serve on the highest court in the 
land,” Napier said. “Someone 
who has committed an act 
of violence against a woman 
cannot be given power to make 
decisions about women’s lives.”

The 
Big 
Ten 
Voting 

Challenge began as part of 
a 
University 
initiative 
to 

increase student turnout, and is 
now a competition between the 
14 Big Ten schools to achieve 
the highest turnout rate in 
the 2018 midterm elections. 
After a protracted discussion, 
the committee approved the 
endorsement resolution. Some 
SACUA 
members, 
however, 

expressed 
concerns 
that 

endorsing the challenge, which 
has been endorsed by all 19 
schools and colleges within 
the University, would send 
an unduly partisan message. 
While 
SACUA 
member 

Bill Schultz, a professor of 
engineering, 
agreed 
with 

SACUA chair Neil Marsh that 
the endorsement “seems pretty 
uncontroversial,” Schultz said 
it wouldn’t be taken that way 
by everyone.

“One of our major parties 

would 
like 
to 
encourage 

students to vote and one would 
like to discourage students 
from voting in their own way,” 
Schultz said. “I just don’t know 
that this couldn’t be another 
slight thing that is going to raise 
eyebrows if we support this. 
I think we should, but I think 

it isn’t as non-partisan as we 
would like it to be. I think this 
is relatively uncontroversial, 
but it will be viewed as a 
political act, I think, by many 
political views.”

The 
University 

frequenty 
draws 
ire 
from 

conservative bodies for its 
historically 
left-leaning 

politics: after President Donald 
Trump’s victory in the 2016 
general 
election, 
University 

president Mark Schlissel faced 
criticism 
for 
comments 

that seemed to disparage the 
election outcome. 

SACUA 
Vice 
Chair 
Joy 

Beatty, an associate professor 
of 
management 
studies 
at 

U-M 
Dearborn, 
expressed 

her disappointment that U-M 
Dearborn could not be included 
in the voting challenge since 
it was not technically a part 
of the Big Ten conference. 
Beatty 
also 
said 
despite 

members’ views on whether 
or not the endorsement was 
controversial, the issue could 
be avoided by voting not to 
endorse.

“The 
thing 
about 
not 

endorsing it is no one’s going to 
know we’re not endorsing it –– 
except for people who read The 
(Michigan) Daily,” Beatty said.

The assembly then shifted 

to 
discussion 
of 
sexual 

misconduct 
policies 
in 

relation to faculty and staff. 

In February, the University 
announced 
it 
would 
hire 

an unnamed outside firm to 
conduct a review of its sexual 
misconduct policies and the 
Office for Institutional Equity, 
which processes all complaints 
related to sexual misconduct 
within the University. The 
review is to be divided into 
two phases: one as a review of 
just the University’s written 
policies on sexual misconduct, 
and 
a 
second 
to 
evaluate 

examples of how those policies 
are carried out. Schlissel said 
at the meeting the reviewer did 
not “have any final comments 
to 
share,” 
but 
shared 
he 

expects the review would be 
complete by the end of the fall 
semester.

SACUA 
member 
Sami 

Malek, a professor of internal 
medicine, 
emphasized 
the 

degree to which faculty were 
unhappy with the current state 
of operations within the OIE.

“This is very important that 

we have somebody looking at 
it,” Malek said. “There’s a lot 
of disappointed people in the 
process.”

Last 
winter, 
The 
Daily 

reported on “The Whisper 
Network,” 
a 
crowdsourced 

database of sexual harassment 
and assault in higher education 
— incidents reported by and 
involving University faculty 
appeared more than a dozen 

times. 

“One thing to consider when 

looking at these cases is in any 
academic relationship there is 
a power dynamic,” Rackham 
student 
Nicole 
Bedera 

commented 
on 
the 
cases. 

“That’s exactly why the people 
who have sexually harassed 
the same people for years have 
been able to get away with it. 

The decision to conduct 

an external review of the 
University’s 
policies 
and 

procedures came shortly after 
revelations in the case of Larry 
Nassar, a doctor at Michigan 
State 
University. 
Nassar 

assaulted students and patients 
under the guise of medical 
treatments over the span of 
three decades and was aided 
by other MSU employees who 
failed to follow through on 
student reports of misconduct 
by Nassar and, in some cases, 
actively 
suppressed 
the 

reports.

While 
Schlissel 

acknowledged that since he had 
come into his role as president, 
there had been “a small number 
of individual cases” involving 
faculty misconduct, he said 
there was no valid comparison 
to the Nassar case.

“I 
don’t 
know 
how 
to 

categorize 
this 
as 
a 
‘big’ 

problem, and to use the Nassar 
example, I thoroughly reject,” 
Schlissel said. “That person was 

committing sexual misconduct 
for 30 years. So, although we 
aspire to have every case done 
as perfectly as we can, to me 
there’s no analogy between 
a consistent handful of cases 
that come through OIE that 
faculty regrettably feel are 
unfairly run, and 30 years of 
sexual assault.”

Finally SACUA addressed 

the case of Prof. John Cheney-
Lippold, 
who 
rescinded 
a 

letter 
of 
recommendation 

for a student’s study abroad 
application after learning the 
program took place in Israel; 
Cheney-Lippold 
is 
engaged 

in an academic boycott of 
the 
country. 
Shortly 
after 

news of the professor’s action 
became public, the University 
released 
a 
statement 

expressing disappointment in 
the professor’s decision, and 
Schlissel spoke against the 
boycott at last week’s Board of 
Regents meeting. 

“It is disappointing that a 

faculty member would allow 
their personal political beliefs 
to limit the support they are 
willing to otherwise provide 
for our students,” the statement 
read. “We will engage our 
faculty 
colleagues 
in 
deep 

discussions 
to 
clarify 
how 

the expression of our shared 
values plays out in support of 
all students.”

Expressing his desire to 

hear the “candid thoughts” 
of SACUA members, Schlissel 
moved the meeting into closed 
session. Following the meeting, 
Marsh released a statement 
from SACUA on the practice 
of writing students letters of 
reference, saying they wished 
“to 
draw 
the 
University 

community’s 
attention” 
to 

the 
American 
Association 

of 
University 
Professors’ 

Statement 
of 
Professional 

Ethics.

“As 
teachers, 
professors 

encourage the free pursuit of 
learning in their students,” the 
AAUP’s statement reads. “They 
hold before them the best 
scholarly and ethical standards 
of their discipline. Professors 
demonstrate 
respect 
for 

students as individuals and 
adhere to their proper roles 
as 
intellectual 
guides 
and 

counselors. Professors make 
every reasonable effort to foster 
honest academic conduct and to 
ensure that their evaluations of 
students reflect each student’s 
true merit. They respect the 
confidential 
nature 
of 
the 

relationship between professor 
and student. They avoid any 
exploitation, harassment, or 
discriminatory treatment of 
students. They acknowledge 
significant 
academic 
or 

scholarly 
assistance 
from 

them. 
They 
protect 
their 

academic freedom.”

Detroit and the University
Last 
week 
the 
University 

announced a partnership with 
Harvard University and the city 
of Detroit to create programs 
to combat the opioid crisis, 
improve 
economic 
mobility 

and 
provide 
educational 

opportunities 
at 
Marygrove 

College in Detroit for students 
and teachers. The University also 
recently acquired the remainder 
of the Horace H. Rackham 
Education Memorial Building in 
Midtown.

With 
these 
recent 

announcements, Schlissel said 
the University plans for a higher 
profile involvement in Detroit.

“I’m trying to find ways for 

all the different research and 
teaching programs that touch 
Detroit to synergize with one 
another, to know about each 
other, and to take advantage 
of one another’s expertise and 
contacts,” Schlissel said.

In 
navigating 
the 

communities within Detroit, 
Schlissel said it’s important to 
have partners in the community 
and 
to 
communicate 
with 

them.

“The worst thing in the 

whole world is to come in, 
do a research program, and 
leave,” Schlissel said. “There 
you’re really taking advantage 
of 
people. 
What 
the 
best 

research and teaching does is it 
identifies great partners in the 
community, works together to 
define what the important 
problems are that need to be 
studied or addressed and then 
collaborates on their solution.”

Schlissel added the thought 

process behind collaborating 
with Harvard for the new 
program in Detroit was to 
utilize their data science and 
economists and pair them with 
Michigan’s expertise of the 
city itself. 

Future Plans
In announcements and focuses 

for this semester, Schlissel said he 
would save large announcements 
for his leadership conference 
coming up in a few weeks. 
However, he did mention the 
University will be looking at 
sustainability and involving the 
arts in other areas of campus.

The focus on environmental 

sustainability 
comes 

after members of the University 
of 
Michigan 
Climate 
Action 

Movement spoke during public 
comment at last week’s board 
meeting. Members stressed the 
University’s place as a leading 
figure 
in 
reducing 
carbon 

emissions. The group pushed the 
University to go carbon neutral 
by 2035 and carbon negative by 
2040.

are working to legalize civil 
unions.

“Since 2003, there were 

eight attempts to introduce 
civil unions,” Smiszek. “So far, 
we are one of the last European 
Union 
countries 
without 

any legislation of this kind. 
Poland is also another country 
without any protection against 
homophobic, 
transphobic 

hate speech and hate crime, 
which has been condemned 
many times by the council of 
Europe.” 

Smiszek noted similarities 

between 
Poland 
and 
the 

U.S.’s struggle for LGBTQ 
rights. He brought up a Polish 
Supreme Court case known 
as the “printer case” that 
bears 
resemblance 
to 
the 

well-known 
Masterpiece 

Cake Shop v. Colorado Civil 
Rights Commision in which 
a 
same-sex 
couple 
sued 

a Colorado baker for refusing 
to make a wedding cake. The 
main difference between the 
cases, however, was that the 
Polish Supreme Court said 
that sexual orientation, race 
or gender could not be the 

basis for refusal of services, 
whereas 
American 
courts 

place a much larger emphasis 
on freedom of religionl.

Smiszek said coming to the 

University helps to promote 
the exchange of ideas within 
international legal systems, 
and helps him identify areas 
of improvement in Poland’s 
activism.

“I’m 
a 
human 
rights 

lecturer and academic, but at 
the same time, I’m an LGBT 
activist and lawyer litigating 
different 
pieces 
on 
LGBT 

discrimination,” he said in 
an interview with The Daily. 
“I think it’s important to 
present this perspective to 
American colleagues. I get 
to learn whether the U.S. is 
behind the equality agenda or 
not. Exchanging experiences 
and thoughts about where is 
the place of LGBT rights in 
the American or Polish legal 
system is important. I am here 
to learn from the American 
perspective, 
and 
I 
am 

astonished at what the LGBT 
community has achieved in 
this country in the last 40-50 
years.”

Sociology 
Professor 

Kiyoteru 
Tsutsui, 
director 

of the Donia Human Rights 
Center, 
said 
their 
center 

brings in speakers based on 
the desires of the students.

“I teach a course on human 

rights, and in that class and 
outside of the classroom I 
sense and I hear our students 
having questions about what 
is going on in the world,” 
Tsutsui said. “They want to 
learn about human rights’ 
standards in the world, the 
various laws- international 
and domestic. So we are here 
to provide that information 
because we have a lot of people 
on campus and outside campus 
who have great expertise on 
human rights issues, politics, 
and law.”

While many of the people in 

attendance were professors, 
LSA 
freshman 
Jagienka 

Timek, a Polish student, was 
one of many students who 
came to the lecture. Timek 
said she tries to keep up with 
news from her home country, 
but didn’t feel like she knew a 
lot about LGBTQ issues.

“My 
parents 
are 
from 

Poland, and I am strongly 
Polish,” Simek said. “I like 
to stay up to date with the 
current political climate in 
Poland, and LGBT rights, it 
hasn’t been in the mainstream 
in news outlets necessarily. 
Going 
to 
Poland 
every 

summer, 
and 
seeing 
the 

referendums, seeing people 
on the streets, demonstrating, 
it makes a personal impact on 
me. There are no protections 
against discrimination or hate 
crimes, and that was crazy to 
me.”

The 
event 
also 
drew 

people 
from 
outside 
the 

University community. Kasia 
Kietlinska, an English and 
Rhetoric professor at Oakland 
University, 
said 
she 
was 

excited when she saw the event 
because of her immersion in 
Polish culture.

“I’m Polish and live in 

Ann 
Arbor 
–– 
I 
follow 

everything,”Kietlinska 
said. “I’m addicted to reading 
Polish publications. It just 
seemed incredibly perceptive. 
He really knows his stuff. And 
just noticing how LGBT rights 
have progressed, from being 
not being not very popular for 
the center to right parties, to 
then becoming accepted by 
these relatively conservative 
groups of people, even in the 
mainstream.”

At the end of the lecture, 

Śmiszek emphasized there are 
great strides being made in 
the LGBTQ community, and 
there has been a vast increase 
in 
participation 
in 
public 

demonstrations and events.

“In 
1998, 
the 
Pride 

Festival 
brought 
together 

only three people with their 
faces covered –– three brave 
activists,” Smiszek said.“And 
twenty 
years 
later, 
there 

were almost 80,000 people 
marching on Warsaw streets.”

Śmiszek 
also 
mentioned 

the 
election 
of 
Anna 

Grodzka was the first openly 
transgender 
member 
of 

parliament in Poland, and 
these 
achievements 
give 

hope to the future of the 
movement. In contrast, the 
United States has never had an 
openly transgender member 
of Congress. Smiszek said he 
hopes students will continue 
to fight for the progression of 
LGBTQ rights here in America 
as well.

“You 
have 
to 
talk 
to 

others,” Smiszek said. “It is 
a challenge to speak to those 
who are hostile. But, you have 
to believe in your fight and 
not give up. It took 20 years 
in Poland, and it started with 
extremely brave people who 
started this discussion around 
LGBT rights. And now, I would 
say you have a blossoming 
of LGBT infrastructure and 
activism.”

W

hen my parents started 
feeding me music, they 
treated love songs like 
alcohol. Little tastes from their cups 
— sips of wine, accosting them if they 
guzzle down more beer than they’re 
allowed. And never any hard alcohol, 
because who gives a 10-year-old a 
shot of vodka?
They played love songs that 
were fluffy and light, interspersed 
on mixed CDs that rotated in the car 
stereos on rides lasting no more than 
10 or 15 minutes. One of the first was 
Bobby Vinton’s version of “Sealed 
With a Kiss,” a beachy tune about 
counting down summer’s end with 
letters between two lovers, each one 
“sealed with a kiss.” I can picture 
my mom driving the car and smiling 
warmly — her eyes closing for a 
tender moment at the red light as she 
sang along with Vinton.
Like a small kid’s tongue dipping 
into red wine, the song contained 
enough flavor of love to keep me 
wondering about the vast sweetness 
I could only experience when I was 
older, with the bitter aftertaste — 
the “cold, lonely summer” Vinton 
alludes to.
Through the succeeding years, 
my iPod was mostly pop songs and 
Broadway show tunes. The playlists 
on my iPod Nano were a flurry of 
jittery mid-2000s Britney Spears and 
Lady Gaga — easy enough to dance to, 
so the lyrical content was rendered as 
meaningless syllables.
When I was 13, however, my 
piano teacher gave me the shot of 
musical vodka. As I struggled to write 
my own songs, she suggested seeking 
inspiration in Joni Mitchell’s records. 
Her recommendation was “A Case of 
You,” a song about the determination 
Joni had to stay standing while taking 
swigs of her lover — like a case of 
wine — until she finished the bottle. 
It was too strong for this 13-year-old, 
being so potent with a longing that 
went deeper than any Bobby Vinton 
rendition. The song’s parent album, 
Blue, ran 10 songs long and sifted 

through every strain of heartbreak, 
insecurity and loneliness. If “A Case 
of You” was a shot, then Blue was a 
handle of liquor.
Yet, as though my taste buds 
weren’t ready, the meaning of each 
song was clear, but the heart of her 
words still proved illusory. Love 
was something that a 13-year-old 
was bound to feel only for his family, 
and even so, that kind of love was an 
entirely different beast. Still, I went 
through artists known to inspire 
and who have been inspired (which 
could include almost every singer-
songwriter of the years following 
Blue) by Mitchell. I found Laura Nyro 
and dusted off her strongest bottle, 
the album New York Tendaberry.
Like Mitchell’s voice, Nyro’s was 
acrobatic, yet struck by the emotional 
paralysis of heartbreak. Her mood 
shifted from yearning anxiety to 
resigned fate. In the opening track, 
“You Don’t Love Me When I Cry,” 
she confronts her lover for only 
distancing himself when she is at her 
weakest. I couldn’t understand why 
her voice was pulling at me so hard. 
As I grew older, I felt disingenuous 
every time I let the words diffuse into 
my blood.
I had never been in love. For 
years, I had feigned attraction to the 
opposite gender, fabricating love 
more than most people my age did, 
even with their seventh or eighth-
grade “boyfriend.” After I came out, 
love songs only distilled attraction 
and emotion more than before.
Love songs increasingly bog 
down my playlists, with heavy-hitters 
like D’Angelo’s ostensibly gentle 
profession of desire, “Really Love.” 
I thought I could transcribe the 
emotion into the bedroom of some 
guy I was hooking up with, putting 
on music in the background to 
make what D’Angelo was singing 
more palpable.
Instead, it feels like every time 
I accompany a Grindr hookup with 
one of my playlists, I just sully the 
meaning rather than connect with it. 

I’ve never been in a relationship — let 
alone felt love — and haven’t seen the 
prospects line up on the horizon.
Suddenly, the notes of each love 
song have unraveled into questions 
of my own inability to find love. 
They choke my capacity to connect 
by acting as reminders that I deceive 
myself when I try to feel, when I try 
to connect. I’ve failed in trying, and 
what was once a connection built on 
curiosity and longing is now just a 
sad, sputtering attempt at knowing 
what it means to be lovelorn.
As I’ve expanded my taste, I can 
connect with artists on different 
levels. I listen to Princess Nokia’s 
“Bart Simpson” and empathize 
with her experience as an outsider 
in school while still comprehending 
the vast contrasts in our lives. But, 
love songs continue to hinder the 
way I internalize music. The more 
my sex life becomes a smattering of 
empty kisses with strangers, the less 
I feel permitted to listen to songs that 
used to intoxicate my senses. Maybe 
the dizzying effect it once had on me 
is now too vertiginous, provoking a 
sense of guilt and self-pity for reasons 
I can’t fully grasp. I’ve become woozy 
— chugging like the college kid I am 
— lapping up the music as a substitute 
for the real thing and letting it pool 
up in the bowels of my mind. In the 
process, I think I’ve frustrated my 
sense for natural, real love.
I started shifting toward sinking 
myself into songs about being 
alone, like Mitski’s “Nobody,” 
a 
swelling 
indie-rock 
song 
about asking for nothing but 
meaningful, loving company.
But, as indulgent as works like 
that are, they just lead me in the 
direction of wanting the same thing 
the artist wants. And then I listen 
to another love song, knowing I 
shouldn’t be allowed.

What might mess up midterm elections
T

here 
was 
something 
inherently 
cringeworthy 
in reading about 11-year-
olds hacking into the database 
of Florida’s election website, not 
because the midterm elections are 
suddenly under the threat of middle-
schoolers, and not because hacking 
the 2018 midterm seems to be child’s 
play. Rather, it was the feeling that 
following the coverage of DefCon 
Voting Machine Hacking Village, 
a workshop at an annual security 
conference, the public was left with 
nothing more than the knowledge 
that democracy is literally in the 
hands of Russian hackers, and that 
there are some very brilliant 11-year-
old kids out there.
Add some smart hackers, dilute 
an issue until left only with its 
sensationalist side, skip all the boring 
parts in the process of solving it, and 
you get technology coverage. Tech 
coverage seems to resemble an ad 
infinitum repetition of these steps, 
with tech companies, non-profits 
and hackathons following suit and 
framing their problems and solutions 
emphasizing the new and shiny. The 
organizers of DefCon described 
the environment the kids used for 
election websites as “exact clones.” 
The press decided to use the same 
language: “Exact clones.” After the 
conference, the organizers cut down 
on their claims, changing the 
term to simply “clones.” When the 
National Association of Secretaries 
of State issued a press release 
complaining that the “environment 
in no way replicates state election 
systems,” Jake Braun, one of the 
organizers, replied that they were 
“fucking idiots” for not seeing that “a 
nation-state is literally hacking our 
democracy.”

Later on, a report revealed 
students were only working with 
look-alikes of election websites, 
with specific vulnerabilities added 
for the event and the participants 
coached on finding them. Still, 
Braun’s 
aggressive 
response 
is 
understandable: He wasn’t actually 
fighting for the legitimacy of his 
voting machines. He was fighting 
for getting the necessary media 
coverage to make the public aware 
of election cybersecurity issues. 
Instead, in the process, the core 
of these issues and their possible 
solutions got lost in hundreds of 
words on terrifying Russian hackers 
and brilliant middle-school hackers.
In response, ProPublica released 
an article on a completely overlooked 
key piece in election security: email 
system vulnerability. The two-
factor verification process is a way 
of logging in that not only requires a 
username and a password, but also 
something only the user has (i.e. a 
unique code on their phone). This 
type of logging in is so widely used 
that even we, as college students, 
can use it to log into our university 
accounts. But, it is also one of the 
things that one-third of the counties 
overseeing toss-up congressional 
elections don’t have access to. 
Internet-connected 
systems 
are 
just as vulnerable to hacking as 
voting machines, but email is such 
a mundane thing that it would be 
hard to find its place in an article 
talking about hackers undermining 
or saving democracy.
Throwing around the words 
“cybersecurity” 
and 
“hackers” 
instinctively brings to mind coders 
trying to solve an encryption. 
Cybersecurity, though, should not 
be regarded as solely a technology 

challenge. Harvard University’s 
Belfer Center for Science and 
International Affairs developed 
a checklist for managing cyber 
risks during political campaigns, 
but you probably won’t see that 
too often in the news. Having a 
report released on cyber risk mostly 
dealing with the “human element” 
in cybersecurity doesn’t seem to 
add anything new or shiny to tech 
coverage. Still, cyber risks mostly 
show up because we are human. 
Because some of the most common 
passwords people use are “123456” 
and “password.” Because we put 
our passwords into spear-phishing 
emails. Because we will sometimes 
share our passwords with the 
people we work with.
The way these conferences 
and journalists frame election 
cybersecurity and tech in general 
affects the perception graduates 
will have on their future tech jobs. 
We want jobs where we can work 
on these supposedly “new” issues 
and solve them with “shiny” codes 
and brilliant hackers. That’s why 
so many of us will want to work 
for Google, Facebook and all the 
other companies that dominate the 
press coverage of technology. In 
the meantime, political campaigns 
are getting hacked because there 
was no training in identifying a 
phishing email. In the meantime, 
counties are struggling to hire 
the people capable of dealing 
with all the emerging cyber risks, 
and people are probably hanging 
around DefCon, hacking supposed 
“election websites.”

Am I allowed to listen to love songs anymore?

Let’s talk about pot
T

his 
November, 
Michiganders 
will 
be 
able to vote on Proposal 
1, 
which 
would 
legalize 
the 
possession, 
consumption 
and 
sale of marijuana for recreational 
purposes. In a recent survey from 
The Detroit News, 56 percent of 
likely voters supported Proposal 
1 and 36 percent opposed it, with 
only 6 percent undecided. Even 
opponents of legalization expect 
it to pass by a wide margin as 
voters, especially young voters, 
will be motivated to the polls by 
the spectacle of legalization. This 
is probably why the Republican 
Party in Lansing tried (and failed) 
to legalize marijuana in an effort 
to keep Proposal 1 off the ballot 
and tamp down on voter turnout 
in an election year that is looking 
increasingly bad for the GOP.
Recreational use of marijuana 
has been legalized in nine states 
and Washington, D.C. Thirteen 
other states and many of Michigan’s 
largest cities — including Ann 
Arbor, Detroit, Grand Rapids and 
Lansing — have decriminalized, 
but not legalized, recreational 
marijuana. 
Decriminalization 
means that someone caught with 
small amounts of marijuana will 
face a civil penalty, such as a 
fine, instead of criminal charges. 
Medical marijuana is also legal in 
Michigan, provided a person has 
one of 22 health conditions the 
state government has approved to 
qualify for treatment with medical 
marijuana, 
including 
autism, 
chronic pain and cancer. People 
with one of these conditions can 
apply for a state medical marijuana 
ID card.
While 
legalization 
and/or 
decriminalization of marijuana is a 
step forward in undoing the tangled 
mess that was the war on drugs, 
the hysteric anti-drug mindset of 
former Presidents Richard Nixon 
and Ronald Reagan still influences 
drug policy at the federal level. 
When Michigan votes to legalize 
recreational marijuana on Nov. 6, 
pot will still sit alongside heroin as 
a Schedule 1 controlled substance 
in the Drug Enforcement Agency’s 
eyes. In states like Colorado, where 
recreational marijuana is already 
legal, the mismatch between state 
and federal statutes means that 
while a person may be able to sell 
marijuana freely, they cannot open 
a bank account for their business. 
Comedian John Oliver does a 
great segment on this topic that I 
encourage everyone to watch.

But, 
I 
am 
not 
a 
legal 
columnist. With the legalization 
of recreational marijuana use in 
Michigan 
seeming 
inevitable, 
it’s high time we have a real 
discussion 
about 
the 
public 
health solutions and challenges 
posed by marijuana.
The properties of marijuana 
come from naturally-occurring 
chemicals 
in 
the 
plant 
that 
interact with the endocannabinoid 
system. The ECS is a system of 
cellular receptors in the nervous 
system that normally bind the 
neurotransmitters AEA and 2-AG. 
The chemicals in marijuana are 
similar enough in structure to 
AEA and 2-AG to bind to the ECS 
receptors and activate the system 
which plays a role in appetite, 
pain, memory and mood. The 
two most well-known chemicals 
in 
marijuana 
are 
THC, 
the 
psychoactive ingredient, and CBD 
though there are many more.
Marijuana has been touted to 
possess all sorts of health benefits, 
chief among them as a non-opioid 
treatment 
for 
chronic 
pain. 
Michigan is in the jaws of a massive 
opioid epidemic and marijuana 
is often mentioned in discourses 
about 
solutions. 
Theoretically, 
opioids and cannabinoids (the class 
of chemicals in marijuana) treat 
chronic pain in much the same 
way. While cannabinoids stimulate 
the ECS, opioids stimulate the 
body’s mu-opioid receptors. Both 
lead to changes in perception of 
the chronic pain. They do not 
treat the underlying cause of 
the pain (e.g. inflammation or 
damaged nerves). The key appeal 
of cannabinoids over opioids is that 
no one has died of an overdose on 
marijuana while thousands have 
overdosed on Oxycontin and 
other opioids. Despite this benefit 
and fairly solid evidence that 
cannabinoids can treat chronic 
pain, U.S. health care providers 
still prefer to prescribe opioids — 
a barrier that must be addressed 
if marijuana is to ever be widely 
used as an opioid alternative.
Marijuana has been shown to 
have other concrete health benefits, 
such as reducing vomiting in cancer 
patients and improving food intake 
in HIV-positive patients. However, 
there are also a fair number of 
fantastical claims out there about 
what pot can cure. Marijuana 
and its non-psychoactive cousin, 
hemp, have been shrouded in 
an aura of mysticism that leads 
some people to believe it can cure 

complex diseases such as cancer. 
The unfortunate truth is there is 
no evidence that marijuana cures 
or slows the course of cancer.
Health care providers, hospital 
and public health organizations in 
Michigan would do well to educate 
people about the reality of what 
marijuana can and cannot do, 
otherwise, we could see patients 
forgoing proper medical treatment 
and instead trying to smoke 
themselves, or their kids, healthy.
Speaking of smoking, let me 
bust one of the most common 
marijuana 
myths 
out 
there: 
Smoking pot is not harmless. 
While not as addictive as opioids, 
about 10 percent of chronic 
marijuana smokers will develop 
a dependence, with a higher 
likelihood 
of 
dependence 
the 
younger you are. Just like other 
substances, stopping marijuana 
can cause withdrawal that while 
not deadly, can make it hard for 
someone to quit if they want to. 
Smoking any burning plant matter, 
be it marijuana, tobacco or even 
lettuce, exposes a person to nasty 
chemicals produced by the burning 
process. Regular marijuana use 
is also linked to heart and lung 
problems as well as at least one 
type of cancer. 
None of this is to say that 
recreational 
marijuana 
should 
remain illegal, just that there is 
a need for widespread education 
about the risks of use when 
Michiganders gain far greater 
access to marijuana. Like alcohol 
and tobacco, marijuana will be 
tightly regulated under Proposal 1 
which should put minds at ease.
Proposal 1 is by no means 
perfect. It does not erase marijuana 
convictions of people, especially 
people 
of 
color, 
who 
have 
predominantly been incarcerated 
under the old war on drugs 
policies. That is the next step. 
When Proposal 1 passes by a hefty 
margin, which I think it will, it will 
also send a message to Congress to 
act to end the federal prohibition 
on marijuana.
The war on drugs was based 
on hysteria and racism, not public 
health concerns. Now that we are 
crawling out of this failed era, it is 
time we treat marijuana the way 
it should be: as a drug with real 
potential to benefit people’s lives, 
but also with some real risks that 
need to be properly mitigated.

You know the old platitude 

that 
someone 
is 
(insert 

compliment) for a (typically 
disparaged group)? To get an 
accurate review of Facebook 

Watch’s newest offering, “Sorry 
For Your Loss,” I’m going to 
have to dust it off. So yes, “Sorry 
For Your Loss” is good. For a 
Facebook Watch show. “Sorry 
for Your Loss” boasts a thought-
provoking premise not easily 
compared with others currently 
on television.

In the wake of her husband 

Matt’s (Mamoudou Athie, “The 
Front Runner”) sudden death, 
young widow Leigh (Elizabeth 
Olson, “Ingrid Goes West”) must 
cope with long-standing family 
drama, the expectation from 
others to just be OK again and 
the realization that she may not 
have known as much about Matt 
as she previously conceived. 
Ironically, what makes the show 
so original is part of the reason 
why it fell so flat — it’s as almost 
as though they had HBO-level 
ideas with a Freeform-level 
action plan. 

Despite the strong premise, 

the show does not elaborate 
from there. By the episode’s 
conclusion, I had no strong 
connection 
to 
any 
of 
the 

characters. Frankly, none felt 
engaging or likable. This very 
well could have been because 
Leigh is depicted as a barre class 
instructor who chooses to yell 
into a microphone to teach a 

class of 12 or because the mom 
reminded me of every difficult 
white woman I’ve ever seen in a 
Michael’s Craft Store.

This 
fault 
was 
only 

highlighted 
more 
by 
the 

raw realism of the general 
premise. 
Characters 
either 

felt incomplete, like Leigh’s 
sister Jules (Kelly Marie Tran, 
“Star Wars: The Last Jedi”), or 
inconsistent, like Leigh herself. 
Jules’s alcoholism is given as 
much depth as a kiddie pool; the 
chance to delve into her internal 
conflict of committing to her 
recovery while her life is not in a 
perfect vacuum was squandered 
in favor of her simply saying that 
she’s “better now.”

Moments like Leigh’s blow 

up at her grief group were 
unfounded. It’s understandable 
that the point was to show her 
unraveling, but the tone of the 
dialogue in the scene felt out 
of place. It was too comedic. 
Yes, dramedies are a thing, but 
an indication of a good one is a 
consistency in tone that “Sorry 
For Your Loss” lacks. Most 
importantly, I simply cannot 
place the trajectory of where this 
show will take us for multiple 
seasons. This show does not 
seem to have the entertainment 
value to carry an audience for 
years; it would fit into a mini-
series or even a film format much 
more comfortably.

After all, the exploration of 

loss and the process of grieving 
is definitely the show at its 
strongest. Rather than flatly 
mentioning through dialogue 
how happy Leigh and Matt were 
before his passing, the writers 
took a page from “This Is Us” 
with the inclusion of flashbacks. 
These flashbacks ensure that 
Matt is an actualized character, 
rather than just a tombstone 
that we have to feel sorrow for 
with every mention. Viewers 
are able to see their relationship, 
and make assumptions about 
its strengths and weaknesses 
for themselves instead of only 
hearing about it from Leigh’s 

perspective — a shrewd choice 
as a large fraction of the show is 
based around the holes in Leigh 

and Matt’s marriage.

The flashbacks are also used 

skillfully to illustrate the show’s 
central point: just how little we 
care about loss or death unless 
we are directly affected by it. 
There is a poignant moment 
midway through the episode 
where viewers flashback to pre-
death Leigh answering an advice 
column question about loss. She 
breezily answers that “it’s not 
the end of the world.” We then 
flash back to modern day, where 
Leigh’s world is evidently over. 
Viewers are forced to wrangle 
with the question, “why are 
we 
so 
uncomfortable 
with 

discussions of death?” I even 
internalized for a moment if this 
is why the show didn’t seem to 
initially pique my interest.

“Sorry 
For 
Your 
Loss” 

currently is the crown jewel 
of Facebook Watch, but on a 
pseudo-network 
that 
boasts 

the likes of “Ball in the Family” 
and 
the 
Degrassi-knock 
off 

“Five Points,” clearly it does not 
take a tremendous amount of 
entertainment value to become 
its standout. 

‘Sorry For Your Loss’ is 
good enough for what it is

Kid-friendly horror movies 

are 
often 
looked 
at 
with 

suspicion, but it’s a genre I 
believe is important. I’m not 

saying you should traumatize 
your child by sitting them down 
and turning on “Hereditary,” 
but a movie that isn’t afraid 
to get creepy or have real 
stakes can offer formative 
experiences 
and 
valuable 

lessons to young audiences, 
teaching them not to stigmatize 
negative emotions like fear 
— a familiar notion for those 
familiar with Pixar’s “Inside 
Out” — because sometimes 
things have to get scary in 
order for there to be a happy 
ending. Movies like “Coraline,” 
“ParaNorman” and even the 
original 
“Ghostbusters” 
all 

attest to this in different ways.

With that philosophy in 

mind, I was excited for the 
latest entry in the genre, “The 
House with a Clock in Its 

Walls,” an adaptation of the 
1973 book of the same name 
by John Bellairs. Directed by 
torture porn king Eli Roth 
(“Death Wish”), of all people, 
it follows 10-year-old Lewis 
Barnavelt 
(Owen 
Vaccaro, 

“Daddy’s 
Home 
2”), 
who 

moves in with his eccentric 
uncle Jonathan (Jack Black, 
“Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get 
Far on Foot”) after the deaths 
of his parents and learns his 
uncle is a warlock searching 
for a sinister clock left in the 
wall of his home by its evil 
previous 
owner. 
Together 

with Jonathan and his uncle’s 
neighbor, a powerful witch 
named Florence Zimmerman 
(Cate Blanchett, “Ocean’s 8”),

FILM REVIEW

BROCKHAMPTON, the boy 

band at the intersection of internet 
hip-hop nerds and hip indie 
teenagers, have released their 
first project of the calendar year: 
iridescence. This project follows 
an immensely prolific 2017, during 
which they released three projects 
and ascended to minor stardom.

The clear strength of this 

album lies within the production 
and the arrangement. A well-
done motif in the production is 
the contrast between organic 
and industrial: swelling, earthy 
strings juxtaposed with distorted 
kicks 
and 
dissonant 
synths, 

elegant piano parts undercut with 
frantic synthetic drum breaks, 
beautiful vocals lines bathed in 
artificial effects and vocoders; 
the strength of the production is 
found in the transient moments 
at the intersection of the natural 
and manmade. Some moments, 
such as the transition between 
“NEW ORLEANS” and “THUG 
LIFE,” are truly inspired. The 
album is overflowing with ideas, 
yet some of the strengths at times 
become flaws: the recklessness, 
the business, the bipolar swings 
in mood and energy. What makes 
the production so creative also 
threatens to throw iridescence into 
disarray and chaos.

Disappointingly, the vocalists 

are far less charismatic than any of 
their previous projects; there are 
no real quotables, and the lyrics, by 
leaning towards the introspective, 
sacrifice the irreverent humor and 
charisma of the Saturation trilogy. 
Part 
of 
BROCKHAMPTON’s 

appeal was that how much fun 
they were having shone through 
their work; that particular quality 
feels muted on this album. Joba 
has always been hit or miss, 
particularly when rapping, but it 
is on iridescence that this becomes 

painfully clear, as he has to pick 
up some of the slack left by Ameer 
Vann’s forced departure. He sets 
the tone for the album with a 
wince-inducingly corny verse on 
“NEW ORLEANS.” Worth noting 
is that his hits are still there, his 
part on “J’OUVERT” being one 
of the most memorable moments 
on the project. Matt Champion’s 
presence on the album is muted: 
He seems to appear less often 
than any other vocalist except for 
Bearface, and when he does it’s 
often forgettable.

While BROCKHAMPTON is 

clearly continuing to grow and 
develop on iridescence, some 
of their clichés are becoming 
tiresome. The autotuned falsettos 
are starting to become old, and 
most of their slow songs still use 
the production as a crutch for 
weak songwriting and uninspired 
harmonic structures, giving off an 
impression not unlike expensive 
ornaments on a plastic tree. What 
played a great role in the band’s 
explosion in popularity was their 
ability to sound unlike anyone else 
on the scene. But after saturating 
the market with four full-length 
projects in a little over a year, they 
don’t possess that same freshness.

Still, there are some great 

cuts: “WHERE THE CASH AT” 
is maybe the eeriest song off 
the album, a pulsing industrial 
beat laid over with rapidfire 
heavily-filtered 
Merlyn 
and 

Matt Champion verses, the final 
product having the not-unpleasant 
effect of boring into your head. 
“WEIGHT” is excellent, sonically 
dynamic 
and 
emotionally 

complex. The sappy string section 
and swelling chorus that open 
it up threaten to turn the song 
mawkish, but the band manages 
to avoid that particular pitfall, 
instead creating a piece that is 
spectral and moving. “DISTRICT” 
is an upbeat distorted track that 
locks into a neurotic groove, while 
the vocalists all come through 
with some of their best work on 
the album. The beat cools off 
in an outro containing an Isaac 
Brock-influenced guitar part and 
some robotic vocal overlays. The 
transition from “J’OUVERT” to 
“HONEY” is probably the best 
executed concept on iridescence 
(it’s a shame that the robotic 

hook on the latter track falls so 
flat). “SAN MARCOS” is “slow 
BROCKHAMPTON” done right — 
too often they fall into blandness 
when they attempt these sensitive 
songs, but something about this 
track feels much more purposeful 
and structured.

BROCKHAMPTON’s greatest 

triumph on iridescence is their 
newfound 
ability 
to 
weave 

together their aggressive and 
sensitive sides. The Saturation 
trilogy would segregate these soft, 
introspective works into interludes 
and outros while the high-energy 
cuts took center stage. They hinted 
at a growing cohesiveness on 
Saturation III with the mid-tempo, 
moody “BLEACH.” It’s only on 
iridescence that they’ve succeeded 
at forcing their disparate styles to 
coexist peacefully.

If 
you’re 
a 
big 

BROCKHAMPTON fan, you will 
either love or hate this album — if 
you’re into the funky, catchy songs 
like “GOLD” and “SWEET,” there 
might not be much for you on this 
project. If you loved aggressive 
cuts like “HEAT” and others of its 
ilk, or if you found yourself drawn 
to reflective, heavily-produced 
songs like “BLEACH,” iridescence 
is deserving of a close listen.

“Sorry For Your 

Loss”

Series Premiere

Facebook Watch

Tuesday @ 9 p.m.

the clock before it brings about 
the end of the world.

For two-thirds of “The House 

with a Clock in Its Walls,” I was 
onboard. The characters and 
their personalities were well-
drawn, and they were brought 
to life with a set of lively 
performances from the entire 
cast, especially the adults. 
Jack Black and Cate Blanchett 
don’t 
seem 
like 
the 
most 

obvious pairing in theory, but 
on screen, their chemistry and 
friendly sniping back and forth 
quickly steals the show. Best 
of all, it’s genuinely unsettling 
and doesn’t always talk down 
to its target demographic. It 
has its failings, yes, mostly a 
set of unfunny fart jokes and 
jump scares — the fart jokes 
of horror — but there’s also 
foreboding production design 
and a mythology that Roth uses 
to build atmosphere and tell 
kids to embrace what makes 
them weird.

Then, as it enters its home 

stretch, 
everything 
falls 

apart. If you’ve ever taken a 
screenwriting 
class, 
you’ve 

been told that if you’re having 
a problem with your third 
act, you’re actually having a 
problem with your second. 
This is usually correct; the idea 
is that you spend your first two 
acts setting up pins that your 
third act will knock down. If 
we were to extend the bowling 
metaphor, Eli Roth spends the 
first 80 minutes of “The House 
with a Clock in Its Walls” 
setting up his pins, then spends 
the last 25 minutes of his movie 
urinating on them.

Strong characterization is 

replaced by garish, godawful 
CGI. 
Clever 
dialogue 
is 

replaced by flatly delivered 
clunkers like, “Come with us to 
the turret. It is a special turret.” 
Atmosphere and an almost 
Spielbergian sense of wonder 
— “The House with a Clock 
in Its Walls” was produced 
by 
Amblin 
Entertainment, 

Spielberg’s 
production 

company — falls away, leaving 

sight gags that wouldn’t be out 
of place in a “Minions” movie. 
For a story that champions 
embracing what makes you 
stand out, to see it fall prey to 
the same tropes that plague 
most kids movies and start 
condescending to its audience 
is disheartening.

There’s not much left by 

the end of “The House with 
a Clock in Its Walls” that can 
be said to be untouched by 
this, including its status as 
what could have been a good 
example of kid-friendly horror. 
It’s tarnished by what feels 
like a studio’s idea of “what 
kids are into these days,” and 
this is coming from someone 
who is usually very hesitant 
to call “studio interference” 
on anything. What could have 
been a formative experience 
for some of the kids in the 
theater ends by regarding them 
as worthy of little more than a 
shrug, and so it received the 
same from many of them as the 
credits rolled.

It’s only on 

iridescence 

that they’ve 

succeeded at 

forcing their 

disparate styles 

to coexist 

peacefully

Release Date: Tuesday, September 25, 2018

6 — Tuesday, September 25, 2018
Arts
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

I 
didn’t 
believe 
in 

superheroes 
until 
LeBron 

James came along, because — 
aside from recently bolstering 
his bid for induction into the 
All-Time Human Hall of Fame 
— LeBron James is really 
good at basketball. He gains a 
cult-like following because he 
does things like effortlessly 
dunking on Kevin Garnett to 
remind us that he is, indeed, a 
superior being. With mouths 
agape and one Kevin Harlan 
assisting our comprehension 
of the insanity with his “with 
no regard for human life” call, 
we feel empowered, because it 
happened. A human did that. 
So, surely, there’s an alternate 
universe where we can do it, 
too.

Caught on the other end 

of that display was Kevin 
Garnett. Future Hall of Famer 
Kevin Garnett. Which is funny, 
because we’ve all been Kevin 
Garnett.

I’ve been Kevin Garnett. A 

lot. Just this past month I’ve 
been yammed on, over and 
over, by strangers and familiar 
faces with a tenacity unseen 
since 
2008 
bedroom 
Nerf 

Hoop showdowns. It stinks. 
It also makes the response 
(the counter-attack) all that 
much sweeter. Because, to live 
a high-flying existence, you 
should — you need — to dunk 
on folks.

Hold your own dunk contest, 

participated in by you, judged 
by you, and announced by 
you. 
Visualize 
your 
own 

posterization. Think it into 
existence. 
Win 
emotionally 

over your arena. Where to 
start? Some inspiration:

DUNK: Zach LaVine, New 

York City, 2015

Metaphorically 
suitable 

for: 
rewarding 
job 
offer, 

growth period, impending 
come-up

We 
begin 
not 
with 
an 

in-your-face jam but with a 
smooth 
maneuver. 
LaVine’s 

dunk is marked by grace, his 
6’5” figure unforcefully gliding 
its way through the air. Worth 
noting is the innovation in 
spite of his late entry into dunk 
lineage; yearly complaints of a 
stale, worn-out dunking canon 
have forced each year’s crop of 
dunkers to get more creative 
with their performances. This, 
however, remains fresh. We see 
this then as mental motivation 
for life adaptation and positive 
self-evolution. When you want 
to 
remain 
graceful 
amidst 

any sort of adversity, be Zach 
LaVine. Go behind the back 
and look beautiful doing so. 
Now you see me, now you don’t. 
Look what I can do with me.

DUNK: 
Julius 
Erving, 

Philadelphia, 1983

Metaphorically 
suitable 

for: 
reunions, 
tough 

conversations, 
wholesome 

closure

This “rock-the-baby” dunk 

is just ridiculous. It took place 
in a real-live game with other 
people who are also 6’7,” and 
also have biceps the size of 
my head, and oh my shit, the 
disrespect. It’s legendary. Dr. 
J’s blunt force is complemented 
by a baby, his baby, and you, 
too, can carry your baby so 
triumphantly. Whether that 
baby is a relationship you’d like 
to maintain, or a connection 
you want to reestablish (or 
bring to a peaceful end), dunk 
with it, or all over it. The slam 
speaks for itself; it’s the most 
effective way to show that you 
know your worth.

DUNK: 
Vince 
Carter, 

Oakland, 2000

Metaphorically 
suitable 

for: getting in their business, 
staying in their business, a 
proverbial middle finger

The best part about this jam 

is that, as Vince Carter was 
preparing for the contest, he 
thought, at some point, “What 
if I just jump so damn high 

I can hang my damn elbow 
in the basket for a while?” 
He then he did exactly that, 
and, save for the reactionary 
gasps 
of 
astonishment, 
we 

instantly felt like an inferior 
breed upon watching it. This 
is disrespect of the highest 
order, and we should take 
notes. Go higher, high enough 
even so you can laugh down on 
those still abiding by the laws 
of gravity. Be petty enough to 
hang on the basket for a while 
and make jaws drop in awe of 
unfuckwithability.

DUNK: Michael Jordan, 

Chicago, 1988

Metaphorically 
suitable 

for: 
unequivocal 
personal 

triumph

When 
MJ 
flew 
through 

another galaxy (a full 15.09 
feet in the air, to be precise) en 
route to NBA legend, it wasn’t 
his 
seemingly 
impossible 

airtime 
that 
was 
most 

important, nor was it the fact 
that he did so in front of 18,000 
adoring 
hometown 
Chicago 

fans. Rather, it was Jordan’s 
tongue wag that made the real 
statement. 
The 
wag 
teases 

silent defiance, as if he was 
internally laughing about his 
upcoming stunt on the world. 
So take a full-court running 
start like Mike, especially if 
it means you’re flying 15 feet 
over fools. Wag some tongue 
and warn them that you now 
run the league — er, their world 
— and will control everything 
they love for the next 10 years. 
Heartless is good and heartless 
is healthy.

That being said, you won’t 

automatically 
be 
Michael, 

because no one wins life upon 
first launch from the free throw 
line. You’ll likely be LeBron’s 
Kevin Garnett first, and that’s 
OK. Just remember: When you 
finally get your Vince-hey-just-
hold-my-balls-for-a-quick-sec 
Carter moment and dunk the 
entire country of France all the 
way back to 1789, Garnett will 
be there to cheer you on.

Navigating life through 

NBA’s best dunks

An artist, an author, a NASA 

advisor and a creative founder, 
Ariel Waldman is a prime 
example of the unexpected. 
Although she has no formal 
science background, she chased 
her admiration and curiosity for 
space exploration, which soon 
lead her to send a spontaneous 
email to NASA. Now, Waldman 
— with a degree in graphic 
design — has launched her 
creative mind into the world of 
NASA, where she advises the 
NASA 
Innovative 
Advanced 

Concepts 
(NIAC) 
program 

and founded a plethora of 
interactive science platforms. 
Being the fulcrum between 
science 
and 
art, 
Waldman 

will be speaking about her 
ingenious work this Thursday 
at the Michigan Theater. 

According 
to 
Spacehack.

org, Waldman’s work involves 
space 
hacking, 
where 
her 

mission is “to make science and 
space exploration disruptively 
accessible.” While many non-
scientific users used to dream 
of having access to space data, 
information and explorations, 
Waldman 
now 
makes 
that 

dream a reality. 

“I remember early on having 

a desire to apply design, and 
the creativity that comes with 
design, towards a much broader 
range of things,” Waldman 
said in an interview with The 
Daily. Some of her most popular 
multiuser 
science 
platforms 

include 
Spacehack, 
Seahack 

and Space Hack Day, where 
she is the global director. Space 
Hack Day, she explained, “is a 
two-day-all-night event where 
anyone excited about making 
weird, silly or serious things 
with science comes together 
in the same physical space to 
see what they can prototype 
within 24 consecutive hours.” 
With her background in design 
and her passion for science, 
Waldman is the glue between 
these two important societal 
mediums. 

“Design has a huge amount 

of power in the world that is 
often underestimated for how 
much it affects how people do 
things and why they do things,” 
she said. “Being trained as a 
designer is really being trained 
in communication and how to 

be an effective translator.” 

Due to her education in 

artistic design, Waldman has 
a “voracious appetite to apply 
design and creative thinking” 

to the world of science and 
other mediums. As a means of 
understanding and engaging, 
she 
brings 
community 

together to not only explore 
for themselves, but also to 
help benefit professional space 
research and exploration. Many 
of these projects stem from 
Space Hack Day that eventually 

lead 
to 
“real, 
tangible 

breakthroughs.” 

In her Ted Talk, Waldman 

describes one of these beneficial 

projects where a participant of 
Space Hack Day designed “The 
Beard Detector,” a device that 
would detect when he would 
need to shave by using a USB 
microscope, a few codes and an 
open computer vision library. 
Later, 
a 
particle 
physicist 

saw this design and created a 
research program that would 
be used to detect cosmic rays in 
a cloud chamber. It is powerful 
projects like these that allow 
Waldman’s work to inspire an 
everyday, non-scientific user, 
and gives them the opportunity 
to 
make 
a 
difference 
in 

progressing science research 
and space exploration. 

“It’s both breaking down 

their 
personal 
goals 
that 

they’ve built up and working on 
breaking down the walls that 
society puts up for them,” she 
said. “It’s trying to break those 
down from both sides.” 

Society tends to keep art 

and science on either side of 
a spectrum, creating a facade 
that they are opposite and 
impermeable crafts. By letting 
people access scientific data 
and 
use 
their 
imagination, 

however, Waldman brings a 
community of innovative and 
progressive people together, 
synthesizing the powers of our 
left and right brains. 

“I like infusing serendipity 

into 
science 
and 
space 

exploration, and for me, getting 
that chance to work at NASA 
was never something I knew 
I could do. I think it’s still 
something that I need to pay off 
to other people,” she said.

Waldman said she never 

expected her degree to lead 
her into a place like NASA. 
Nonetheless, she lives her life on 
the line of what is possible and 
what is deemed impossible. By 
creating a world of “what ifs,” 
neither she nor her participants 
need to know where their 
imaginations are going to lead. 
The lack of expectation seems 
to be a highlight of Waldman’s 
work and a key aspect to her life 
as well. 

“I think the greatest aspect 

of my work is knowing that the 
door is open for them (users) to 
play around in other disciplines. 
And for that, it can be either life 
changing or not life changing at 
all. But knowing they can walk 
through that door whenever 
they want is the most important 
thing for me.”

Rashan Gary sharpening his leadership skills in his junior season

Rashan Gary could have argued 
with his coaches on Saturday 
when they opted to hold him out 
for the second half of the No. 14 
Michigan football team’s blowout 
win against Nebraska.
Part of the reason for Gary’s 
rest could have been a possible 
shoulder injury he suffered in 
the first half. The trainers were 
around him for a while, and it 
looked like they were tending to 
Gary’s shoulder, but Gary smiled 
and shrugged it off as a problem 
with his pads at Monday’s media 
availability. It wasn’t the most 
convincing deflection, but he 
showed no sign of an ailment 
Monday, so there’s no reason to 
doubt that he could have played if 
needed.
Still, with the score already 
out of hand, Gary had to fight 
his competitive nature that was 
telling him to argue his way 
back into the game, and take an 
uncharacteristic backseat to let 
younger players get some action.
“You know, it’s the bigger 
picture,” Gary said. “Me sitting 
back, and, you know, me not 
taking those reps, I was actually 
happy, because I got a chance, you 
know, to help (freshman defensive 
end Aidan Hutchinson) with what 
he’s seeing in the game, helping 
(sophomore defensive end Kwity 
Paye) see what he’s seeing in the 
game. You know, just hyping 
them up. Getting hype with them. 
Letting 
them 
know, like, ‘While 
you’re 
on 
the 
field, this is yours. 
And anything you 
want you can go 
get.’ And it was 
fun.
“Yeah, 
of 
course, 
as 
a 
competitor, 
I 
want to be on the 
field every play, 
every snap. But, it’s the bigger 
picture.”
He is an unquestioned leader 

on a defense with a ton of 
experience. From the preseason 
until now, stories 
have been told 
about Gary taking 
Hutchinson 
under his wing — 
Gary admitted he 
tells Hutchinson 
he is better than 
Gary was as a 
freshman.
That’s 
saying 
a 
lot, 
because 
Gary 
was 
the 
consensus No. 1 recruit in his 
class, and the MVP of the 2016 
Under Armour All-America Bowl. 

He’s developed into a dominant 
player on the defensive line, 
and Saturday was his best game 
of the season so far — he had a 
season-high two tackles for loss, 
including a sack in a little less 
than one half of play.
“His 
preparation 
during 
the week, his intensity during 
practice, 
everything,” 
said 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh, 
“sets a great example for the rest 
of the players on the team. If you 
want to be, ‘I want to play like 
Rashan Gary. How do I go about 
that?’ Study Rashan. See how 
he approaches his workouts, his 
practice, you know, meetings, and 

you’re gonna see it at the highest 
level.
“It’s a great position to be in 
as a coach to say, ‘Okay, look at 
your best player. Look how he 
prepares.’ ”
Some of that work ethic and 
leadership ability has surely come 
from observations Gary has made 
of the players before him. He 
played alongside Maurice Hurst 
for the past two seasons, and was 
in Hutchinson’s position when 
Taco Charlton and Chris Wormley 
were the starting defensive ends.
Hurst, Charlton and Wormley 
are all in the NFL now.
But junior cornerback Lavert 

Hill came in with Gary and 
knew him from the start. He says 
Gary’s leadership qualities have 
progressed, sure, but were even 
present back in his freshman 
season.
“He always had it, like, as 
soon as he came in,” said junior 
cornerback Lavert Hill. “So him 
just getting older and getting 
more mature, I can see it, like, just 
progress over time.”
Whether 
Gary’s 
example 
has elevated the play of his 
teammates is something that can 
probably never be confirmed. 
Michigan’s defense is very good 
and extremely deep — it held 

Nebraska to 132 yards all game, 
and many reserves got solid 
playing time.
What is a sure thing is that 
Gary’s presence on the field 
obviously helps the Wolverines — 
after all, he’s a future early-round 
draft pick.
And 
if 
Gary’s 
words 
on 
Hutchinson replacing him for 
Saturday’s second half are to be 
believed, Gary is content to see 
his teammates make plays while 
he’s out.
“That’s my brother, I want to 
see him shine,” Gary said. “If 
I shine, we all shine, and vice 
versa.”

KATELYN MULCAHY/Daily
Junior defensive end Rashan Gary has become a player that Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh can point to as an example of how hard work and dedication can help a player become elite.

WOMEN’S SOCCER
‘M’ falls to Minnesota, 
1-0, in double overtime

If you blinked, you may 
have missed it. Out of nothing, 
Minnesota senior April Bockin 
received the ball at the edge of 
the box, took a few touches and 
rifled a shot into the far corner.
Michigan players fell to their 
knees in disappointment. For 
the second time in four games, 
the Wolverines had lost in 
double overtime, 1-0.
The Wolverines’ previous 
loss came at the hands of 
another 
Big 
Ten 
rival 
— 
Indiana — just ten days ago. 
Senior forward Reilly Martin 
and 
sophomore 
midfielder 
Sarah Stratigakis had given 
Michigan 
an 
early 2-0 lead, 
only to see it 
disappear in the 
last five minutes 
of 
the 
game. 
The 
Hoosiers 
pushed the game 
into 
overtime 
with two quick 
goals and then 
finished 
their 
comeback 
operation just three minutes 
before the final whistle.
On Sunday, as the Golden 
Gophers 
rejoiced 
following 
their 
sudden 
death 
goal, 
Michigan 
coach 
Jennifer 
Klein 
was 
left 
pondering 
the unfortunate trend that 
seems to be developing for the 
Wolverines.
“You’re going to face games 
like that where it’s just not 
— everything’s not clicking, 
and you’re just gonna have 
to find a way to get a result,” 
Klein said. “We didn’t do that 
against Indiana and we failed 
to do it again today. We can’t 
check out in those moments. 
We have to be dialed in and 
ready to go. Those moments are 
championship moments and we 
have to be better in those.” 
Michigan 
may 
not 
have 
been firing on all cylinders, 

but 
throughout 
regulation 
and overtime, it was the one 
creating the better scoring 
opportunities. 
Sophomore 
forward 
Nicki 
Hernandez 
was a consistent threat to the 
Minnesota 
defense, 
chasing 
balls into the box and testing 
the 
goalkeeper. 
Stratigakis 
was also creating chances both 
with her passes and long shots 
from outside the box. Despite 
this, the Wolverines couldn’t 
apply the finishing touch.
Until the final play, Michigan 
had kept it relatively tight at the 
back, too. In fact, sophomore 
Wolverine goalkeeper Hillary 
Beall didn’t have to record a 
save until the second overtime 
period.
And 
yet, 
this seemingly 
advantageous 
combination 
of 
offensive 
and 
defensive 
control 
led 
to 
nothing. 
At the end of 
regulation, 
the game was 
still scoreless. 
The 
Gophers 
proceeded to pull out the 
victory in double overtime, 
breaking Michigan hearts.
Although the score lines of 
the two games may have been 
very different, the storylines 
weren’t. Both games saw the 
Wolverines 
dominate 
early 
before crumbling in late game 
situations. 
Whether 
that’s 
down to inexperienced youth, 
or just a lapses in concentration, 
Michigan’s inability to seal the 
deal has cost it two pivotal Big 
Ten results.
“I think we just needed to be 
smarter in certain situations,” 
Klein said. “Not put ourselves 
in areas where we gave the 
ball away, when we could have 
simply just kept it. But overall, 
I don’t think fatigue was a big 
factor today, we just made 
some bad mistakes, and lost our 
focus unfortunately.”

CONNOR BRENNAN
Daily Sports Writer

“... we just 
made some bad 
mistakes and 
lost our focus...”

Wolverines’ pressure isn’t enough vs. Gophers

It only took one good shot.
After 14 minutes of overtime 
with only one previous shot, 
Minnesota’s 
April 
Bockin 
stepped into the top right 
corner of the box and fired a 
game-winning strike that beat 
the 
Wolverines’ 
sophomore 
goalkeeper Hillary Beall to 
the top left corner of the net. 
The Gophers (2-1-1 Big Ten, 
6-4-1 overall) streamed onto 
the field to celebrate, and the 
Michigan 
women’s 
soccer 
team (2-2, 6-5) was left to 
figure out what went wrong, as 
it fell, 1-0, in double overtime.
After a back and forth first 
half with no real scoring 
chances, 
the 
Wolverines 
changed 
their 
offensive 
scheme in the second half 
and began to put pressure on 
Minnesota. 
Sloppy passing throughout 
the first period held Michigan 
to six shots, with just two on 
target. For the second half, 

Michigan coach Jennifer Klein 
used two holding midfielders 
to increase passing efficiency.
“I felt that that (switch) 
gave us a little bit of some 
better balance and allowed for 
us to find the ball a bit better,” 
Klein said. “We created some 
better movement up top.”
For the majority of the 
second half — particularly 
from 
the 
70th 
minute 
on — the Wolverines put 
consistent pressure on the 
Gophers’ 
defense. 
Redshirt 
junior midfielder Katie Foug 
had an open chance near 
the box but just missed on 
the 
pass. 
Moments 
later, 
freshman midfielder Meredith 
Haakenson received a cross 
from senior midfielder Abby 
Kastroll and fired a shot that 
went just wide of the net.
With every close pass, every 
time a Michigan player chased 
down a loose ball near the net, 
every shot that just missed, the 
crowd at U-M Soccer Stadium 
grew louder. The anticipatory 
energy was palpable, and it 

almost seemed that a goal was 
inevitable for the Wolverines.
But as time ticked towards 
the 90th minute and regulation 
ended with the score still 
deadlocked, it became clear 
that the Michigan pressure 
may not be enough.
Open scoring chances were 
repeatedly 
blocked 
by 
the 
Minnesota 
defense, 
shots 
were saved by the Gophers’ 
goalkeeper 
Maddie 
Nielsen 
and the 90th minute came and 
went — and the score remained 
0-0.
The Wolverines remained 
tough in overtime, matching 
Minnesota’s 
physicality 
blow for blow. The game was 
highlighted by hard hits and 
tough tackles, as is somewhat 
expected from a Big Ten 
matchup.
“Every game is gonna be a 
physical battle,” Klein said. “I 
felt as if in some moments we 
were unfortunate to not get 
some calls our way, but that’s 
the nature of the game. We 
have to learn to push through 

that and make our necessary 
adjustments to give ourselves 
a chance.”
Seven minutes into the first 
overtime, Michigan had what 
may have been its best scoring 
chance of the game. Senior 
forward Reilly Martin passed 
a corner kick to sophomore 
midfielder Sarah Stratigakis, 
who sent the ball to the top 
of 
the 
box 
for 
freshman 
midfielder Raleigh Loughman.
Loughman’s shot bounced 
off the goalpost, and the 
Wolverines’ scoring chance 
— their only shot in either 
overtime period — was over. 
Minutes later, in the second 
overtime, after all the crowd’s 
anticipation and hope for a 
Michigan goal, it only took 
one strike from the Gophers 
to 
send 
the 
crowd 
home 
disappointed.
“We can’t check out in those 
moments,” Klein said. “We 
have to be dialed in and ready 
to go. Those moments are 
championship moments and 
we have to be better in those.”

With real tests still on the horizon, offensive line showing improvement

Junior 
defensive 
end 
Rashan 
Gary 
has 
noticed 
a trend with the opposing 
offensive line in practice. 
If Gary and his crew of All-
America-level defensive line 
talent win a rep, the offensive 
group wants another.
“ ‘Let me get that rep back,’ 
” Gary recalls hearing. “ ‘We’ll 
do it again.’ ”
Added Gary: “Iron sharpens 
iron.”
It’s 
part 
of 
a 
broader 
attitude Gary and much of the 
team have started realizing: 
the offensive line is confident 
and only gaining confidence 
each week.
“We’ve been saying it all 
year,” said junior guard Ben 
Bredeson, 
“that 
we’ve 
all 
gotten a lot better.”
Bredeson isn’t wrong; they 
have been saying it all year. 
Some — those in the media 
included — just haven’t been 
willing to listen. Last week, 
senior tackle Juwann Bushell-
Beatty pushed back against 
fans who judge offensive line 
play without understanding 
its nuance. 
“The public doesn’t really 
understand 
the 
inner-
workings of how things go 
on in here. I think there were 
mistakes, 
and 
when 
there’s 
mistakes — and 
there’s 
always 
— 
everyone 
wants to point 
fingers 
and 
there are things 
that happened,” 
he 
said. 
“It’s 
football. 
I 
understand, 
regardless 
of 
what happens, O-Line is going 
to take blame for whatever.”
In week one, that criticism 
was 
defeaning, 
after 
the 
offensive line took the brunt 
of the heat for a 24-17 loss 
against 
Notre 
Dame. 
The 
Wolverines averaged just 1.8 
yards-per-rush in that game, 
and managed to score 10 

offensive points. 
In the three games since, 
Michigan has averaged over 
278 yards rushing and 50 
points per game. And after 
being 
sacked 
three 
times 
(and pressured 
countless 
more) 
in 
the 
opener against 
the 
Fighting 
Irish, 
junior 
quarterback 
Shea Patterson 
has been sacked 
just three times 
in 
the 
three 
games since.
You might say it’s unfair 
to 
judge 
the 
offensive 
line against three inferior 
opponents. 
Bushell-Beatty 
and other offensive linemen 
might say it was just as unfair 
to judge them after one game, 
the season-opener. 
It works both ways, which 

is why the group up front 
doesn’t get too bogged down 
in outside perception.
“We don’t have any stats to 
go with the work that we do, 
but just seeing 
it 
on 
film,” 
Bredeson said. 
“If 
you’re 
an 
O-Lineman, you 
understand, you 
can 
see 
what 
you’re 
doing 
well, 
what 
you’re not doing 
well.”
While 
increased 
repitition among the starting 
unit 
— 
Bushell-Beatty, 
Bredeson, sophomore Cesar 
Ruiz, junior Michael Onwenu 
and 
fifth-year 
senior 
Jon 
Runyan — has players and 
coaches encouraged, much of 
the optimism regarding the 
offensive line has to do with 
those working behind the 

starters.
In 
Saturday’s 
56-10 
annhiliation of Nebraska, 10 
reserve 
offensive 
linemen 
saw game action, including 
promising 
freshmen 
tackles 
James 
Hudson 
and 
Jalen Mayfield. 
The 
duo 
— 
often 
grouped 
together 
for 
convenience — 
has been coming 
along 
well, 
even 
sniffing 
potential 
starting roles. It seems both 
will be starters at Michigan, 
whether that’s one week or 
one year from now. Last week, 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
said each was taking roughly 
25 percent of the reps with the 
first-team offense. 
Bredeson 
has 
seen 
significant 
potential 
with 

both, in practice and limited 
game action.
“James 
(Hudson) 
is 
an 
outstandingly 
athletic 
kid. 
Once 
he 
cleans 
up 
some 
technique 
things and gets 
his consistency 
down, it’s scary 
how 
far 
that 
kid could go,” 
Bredeson said. 
“Measurables, 
you can’t really 
measure it, but 
you can see it 
every 
single 
day when he’s 
making progress. And he’s 
made a ton of progress. If you 
watched film from this spring 
all the way to now, it’s night 
and day.
“Jalen 
(Mayfield) 
made 
huge 
strides, 
coming 
in, 
especially as a freshman. It 
was a big learning curve, but 
I think we’re past that now 

with him. Really happy with 
him.”
As any offensive lineman 
will tell you, though, there’s 
tremendous 
intangible 
value 
in 
the 
development 
of 
cohesion. 
When 
asked 
where the unit as a whole 
has improved most, Bredeson 
pointed to communication. 
“I felt like we didn’t talk 
enough early weeks, especially 
in the Notre Dame game,” 
Bredeson said. “Now, we’re 
not 
only 
communicating, 
we’re 
over-communicating. 
Things are going really well 
for us on the line. Once we’re 
able to talk through the looks 
and see what we have, that 
gives Cesar the full picture of 
what’s going on; he can make 
all the adjustments.”
And as all the other pieces 
seem 
to 
fall 
into 
place, 
as an All-Big Ten caliber 
quarterback starts to come 
into his own, as a young 
receiving 
corps 
continues 
to blossom, as the group of 
tight ends round out what’s 
nearing a complete offense, 
the offensive line seems to be 
the final piece to the puzzle. 
It’s certainly no guarantee 
the maligned group ever gets 
to 
an 
above-average 
level 
against other top-end Big Ten 
teams — it seems nobody will 
know until the mid-season 
matchups 
against 
Wisconsin, 
Penn State and 
Michigan State.
But Bredeson, 
the 
de 
facto 
leader 
of 
the 
offensive 
line, 
is confident his 
unit will excel, 
even if those on 
the outside are 
still scarred from week one.
“I think we’ve matured 
a lot, more than you should 
in three games,” Bredeson 
said. “The way normal teams 
mature through the season, 
I think we’re past where we 
should be on paper. I think 
that’s going to pay dividends 
later on.”

Michigan dominates, settles for tie against PSU

Two minutes is rarely enough 
time to determine the better team in 
a soccer match. Sometimes, though, 
it’s enough to impact the result.
Unfortunately for the Michigan 
men’s soccer team (1-0-1 Big Ten, 
5-1-1 overall), Friday night was one of 
those times, as it drew Penn State 1-1.
Just 130 seconds into the game, it 
fell a goal behind when the Nittany 
Lions’ Christian Sload collected a 
pass near the penalty spot, turned 
and fired past the Wolverines’ 
sophomore 
goalkeeper 
Henry 
Mashburn.
“It did catch us off guard but that 
shouldn’t be happening,” Mashburn 
said.
Added Michigan coach Chaka 
Daley: “Those mistakes and that 
focus in the first couple of minutes 
might have been the difference in 
getting three points or one point.”
The Wolverines, though, quickly 

settled into the game, dominating 
the rest of regulation.
Just two minutes after the goal, 
sophomore forward Jack Hallahan 
put Michigan on the front foot 
by taking the ball in midfield and 
beating a few defenders on his way 
into the Penn State box, although 
his eventual cross inched too close 
to goalkeeper Josh Levine.
Though 
it 
didn’t 
lead 
to 
anything, that burst of energy was 
foreshadowing of things to come for 
the Wolverines.
Over the next 65 minutes, 
Hallahan was the their best player, 
penetrating the Nittany Lions’ 
defense from the right wing all 
night.
“I’m smart enough to know that 
when someone’s playing well, let’s 
make sure to get it to him,” Daley 
said.
“One day it’s Umar (Farouk 
Osman), the next day it’s (Hallahan), 
one day it’s (Mohammed) Zakyi.”
On Friday, it was Hallahan. And 

finally, after spending the evening 
whipping in crosses that couldn’t 
find a man or shots that just missed 
the target, he was the one who broke 
through for Michigan in the 70th 
minute.
He cut onto his left foot and put 
a dangerous cross into the penalty 
box, where it deflected off a Penn 
State defender and into the net.
“We put them under a ton of 
pressure and I think at some point, 
something’s gotta give,” Daley said. 
“And I thought we just continued to 
press and press and put stuff in on 
tip of the goalkeeper and something 
had to give and we found one. We’ll 
take it any way we get it.”
Four minutes earlier, though, 
came the biggest of a string of 
missed chances for the Wolverines 
that could have turned into goals.
Hallahan was at the center of 
Michigan’s attack again, as he broke 
down the right wing before cutting 
a pass back to senior forward Noah 
Kleedtke, whose shot was kick-

saved by Levine from close range.
When asked if any missed 
chances stood out to him, Hallahan 
pinpointed that play.
“Noah Kleedtke’s where I’ve 
gone down the line and cut it back 
and their keeper’s got a foot on it,” 
Hallahan said. “It’s just margins at 
that point.”
Ultimately, 
that 
inability 
to 
convert 
chances 
doomed 
the 
Wolverines. With 12 minutes left 
in 
regulation, 
senior 
defender 
Marcello 
Borges 
found 
senior 
midfielder Ivo Cerda six yards out 
but Cerda couldn’t put it on target.
That ended up being Michigan’s 
last major chance as Penn State 
rebounded in a balanced overtime 
period, and for all their dominance, 
Daley and the Wolverines had to 
settle for a draw.
“We’re disappointed because 
that (opening goal) was maybe the 
difference for us,” Daley said. “… But 
fortunately, we got one point. And at 
the end of the day, that’s important.”

VOLLEYBALL
Wolverines lose against 
Nebraska, defeat Iowa

Michigan coach Mark Rosen 
called this weekend’s experience a 
new dynamic for the team.
He 
was 
referring 
to 
the 
beginning of Big Ten play, of 
course, but in many more ways 
than one, the seventeenth-ranked 
Wolverines volleyball team had 
to face a new dynamic — losing 
— as it dropped its first match of 
the season against No. 3 Nebraska 
before bouncing back to beat Iowa.
“I thought we played okay at 
times, but we didn’t play at the level 
that we needed to to be successful,” 
Rosen said. “That was the first loss 
for us, how’s the team going to 
respond? How are they going to be 
able to come back from that?
“We don’t know because we 
haven’t done it all year.”
Despite the set count saying 
otherwise, as Michigan fell in four 
sets to the Cornhuskers, the game 
was close-knit, with both teams 
encountering ways to exploit one 
another’s weaknesses.
Though for the Wolverines, 
their weaknesses were an open 
book — and Nebraska read it.
While tough serving will throw 
any team off, Michigan’s passing 
dove in quality due to taking the 
brunt of bad first touches, and 
in turn, the offense as a whole 
struggled. The Cornhuskers were, 
as Rosen emphasized, “huge,” and 
against a mismatch physically, 
mediocre passes won’t get the job 
done.
In many cases where one team 
is more dominant sizewise, it is 
counterable with pinpoint passing. 
 
There are ways to work around a 
stable block if the spiker has flexible 
spiking options once in the air — 
which falls upon the setter to make 
happen. And there was no question 
that Nebraska was bigger and more 
physical.
But by taking away junior 
setter Mackenzi Welsh’s typically 

accurate-passes through aggressive 
serving, the Cornhuskers disrupted 
the Wolverines’ balanced offense 
so that it could only muster a .135 
attack average to a .314 of their own 
— a game-defining differential. 
They 
essentially 
made 
it 
so 
Michigan had no choice but to hit 
where and when they wanted to 
and made the offense predictable.
When you face someone more 
physical, someone who forces you 
out of your game plan and has all 
the adjustments to counter what 
you are good at, there’s little you 
can do.
But the Wolverines found a way 
to keep the match against the third-
best team in the nation competitive, 
and it is every bit a testament to 
their tenacity. But that alone just 
wasn’t enough. Nebraska had the 
edge in every statistical category 
and came out on top accordingly.
The real worry for this Michigan 
team was how it would respond to 
the loss, something it had avoided 
all year. There are many routes a 
team can go after the first loss, but 
the Wolverines took one that Rosen 
thought of as a nice job in bouncing 
back.
In a nearly-equivalent statistical 
game, Michigan found a way to 
tip the balance through standout 
performances from its outside 
hitters. Junior Sydney Wetterstrom 
hit a career-high 21 kills, while 
senior Carly Skjodt and freshman 
Paige Jones added 18 and 14 kills, 
respectively.
Those players proved to be a 
difference maker in an up-and-
down match.
“It was a good, balanced match,” 
Rosen said. “They were good. 
We were good. And it was really 
back-and-forth, and the first set 
was really tight, and I thought we 
competed really well in those last 
few points to finish it out...”
