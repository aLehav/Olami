Philip J. Deloria, former 

University 
of 
Michigan 

professor, became Harvard 
University’s 
first 
tenured 

Native-American 
studies 

professor 
last 
week 
after 

having taught in the History 
and 
American 
Culture 

Department at the University 
for over ten years. Deloria 
specialized 
in 
Native-

American history and also 
served as the associate dean 
for 
Undergraduate 
and 

Graduate Education in LSA, 
director 
of 
the 
Program 

in 
American 
Culture 
and 

acting director of the Native 

American Studies Program. 
In his time at the University, 
Deloria was an outspoken 
advocate for Native American 
students and inequalities in 
higher education. 

Deloriaa 
earned 
his 

doctorate degree in American 
Studies from Yale University 
and taught at University of 
Colorado before coming to 
the University. He became 
a Carroll Smith-Rosenberg 
Collegiate Professor in 2009.

“At Michigan, I was really 

fortunate to be involved in 
building the Native American 
Studies 
program,” 
Deloria 

said. “I feel like my time at 
Michigan was full of really 
good things and it was really 

LSA Student Government 

passed 
five 
resolutions 

Wednesday night, including 
one in support of the Lecturers’ 
Employee 
Organization’s 

negotiations 
for 
a 
new 

wage contract and another 
calling for an investigation 
into potential conflicts of 
interest in investment of the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 

endowment. 
The 
latter 

resolution 
was 
introduced 

and approved in time for LSA 
SG to join a group of student 
organizations also requesting 
further transparency before 
the Board of Regents’ meeting 
Thursday afternoon.

LSA 
SG 
representative 

Amanda 
Delekta, 
an 
LSA 

junior, 
co-sponsored 
the 

resolution.

“The 
regents, 
who 
are 

supposed 
to 
overlook 
the 

investment of the endowment, 
passed 
the 
responsibilities 

largely on to a financial 
executive 
committee,” 
she 

said. “A number of those 
individuals 
have 
been 

investing the endowment into 
their own enterprises, which 
is obviously a large conflict 
of interest and there has not 
been a lot of oversight with 
the issue.”

The Detroit Free Press 

recently 
reported 
the 

University invested portions 
— estimates range from $3 

to nearly $4 billion — of its 
nearly $11 billion endowment 
in funds run or owned by 
major donors. The resolution 
passed with 19 votes in favor 
and three against. LSA SG 
members 
debated 
whether 

the allegations of conflicts 
of interest had merit and if 
calling for an investigation 
might needlessly incite the 
regents. 

Representative 
Jordan 

Schuler, an LSA sophomore, 
said he didn’t see how an 
investigation 
could 
hurt, 

especially if the claims about 
the endowment, as University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

wrote in an op-ed in the Free 
Press, are false.

“Passing 
this 
resolution 

doesn’t necessarily say that 
we believe there is severe 
malpractice, 
but 
passing 

it does say that it’s worth 

finding out,” Schuler said.

The resolution in support 

of LEO’s bargaining efforts 
comes two days after the 
University responded to the 
union’s salary proposals. The 
union, which represents non-
tenure track faculty across all 
three University of Michigan 
campuses, is asking for higher 
wages 
and 
enhanced 
job 

security. On Monday night, 

On 
Monday, 
several 

Michigan 
lawmakers 

proposed 
new 
legislation 

during 
a 
Michigan 
House 

of 
Representatives 
meeting 

to fight sexual assault and 
harassment in response to the 
Larry Nassar trials, #MeToo 
movement 
and 
#TimesUp 

movement. The call for new 
policy has a specific focus on 
college campuses in hopes 
of 
increasing 
prevention, 

education 
and 
protection 

services.

In early February, Nassar 

received his third sentence of 
40 to 125 years for sexual assault 
charges. 
The 
260 
reports 

against Nassar included those 
of Olympic gymnasts Jordyn 
Wieber and Aly Raisman, as 
well as countless other women 
who were assaulted under 
his treatment as a former 
Michigan State University and 
USA Gymnastics doctor. These 
reports of abuse contribute to 
the thousands of women who 
have recently come into the 
spotlight under the banner

University alum, Democrat running to replace Republican Dave Trott in 11th district

Dan Haberman, one of the 

11 candidates for Michigan’s 
11th Congressional District seat 
and University of Michigan 
alum, has made the decision to 
unionize his campaign staff. 

Haberman, who received his 

bachelor’s degree in political 
science from the University, 
is a businessman, lawyer and 
Democrat from Birmingham 
running to replace the seat 
vacated by former U.S. Rep. 
Dave 
Trott, 
R-Birmingham. 

Democrats 
hope 
to 
claim 

another 
U.S. 
congressional 

seat 
despite 
the 
district’s 

Republican-leaning history.

Now, Haberman is unionizing 

his staff in a move that he says 
symbolizes his commitment to 
workers’ rights.

“I believe that it is important 

to protect all Michigan workers. 
It’s not always convenient, but 
it’s the right thing to do. Our 

representatives 
in 
Congress 

are sent there to represent 
and protect the people they 
represent and to take action,” 
he said. 

His Democratic opponents 

include 
Haley 
Stevens,

former chief of staff for an 
auto task force led by former

A study conducted at the 

University of Michigan found 
unhealthy body weight may 
make it harder to resist food, 
an 
important 
step 
in 
the 

struggle to prevent obesity. 
In her study, Carrie Ferrario, 
a 
research 
and 
assistant 

professor 
at 
the 
Medical 

School, 
discovered 
obesity-

prone rats had a stronger 
response to a sound signaling 
food, and the rats that showed 
the strongest response were 
the ones that gained the most 
weight.

To test her theory, Ferrario 

cued rats, both obesity prone 
and 
obesity 
resistant, 
by 

associating the promise of food 
with a certain sound. She then 
trained the rats to push a lever 
when they wanted food.

She found the rats that 

were more prone to obesity 
were more likely to press the 
lever when they heard the 
sound. She also discovered the 
obesity-prone rats developed 
more CP-AMPA receptors in 
the nucleus accumbens region,

On Tuesday, 11 biomedical 

projects from across the state 
of Michigan were selected as 
recipients of the Innovation 
Hub awards. Fast Forward 
Medical Innovation, a unit 
within the Medical School’s 
Office of Research at the 
University 
of 
Michigan, 

grants the awards. More than 

$1.8 million in total has been 
allocated 
to 
health-related 

research projects statewide, 
ranging 
from 
automated 

brain tumor diagnosis using 
convolutional neural networks 
to 
reversing 
synchronized 

circuitry to treat tinnitus in 
humans.

The 
awards 
are 

funded 
by 
the 
Michigan 

Translational Research and 
Commercialization for Life 
Sciences 
Innovation 
Hub, 

which is managed by Fast 
Forward Medical Innovation 
and funded by the University 
and the Michigan Economic 
Development Corporation.

The 
MTRAC 
Innovation 

Hub 
began 
solely 
as 
a 

University program in 2014 
but has since expanded to the 
entire state of Michigan. It has 
an operating budget of over $4 
million.

One 
project 
which 
was 

granted 
the 
award 
is 
a 

University 
research 

team led by Susan Shore, 
a professor within the 
University’s Department of 
Otolaryngology-Head and 
Neck Surgery. The team 
is developing a device to 
treat tinnitus, a condition 
that causes a ringing in the 
ears and affects 15 percent 
of Americans. They have 
conducted 
successful 

trials on guinea pigs and 
are starting to work with 
humans.

“This tells us a lot about 

how the circuitry in the 
brain changes after noise 
damage and tells us how 
the auditory system works 
in general, so that can end 
up helping other kinds of 
hearing disorders as well,” 
Shore said in January.

Howard 
Petty, 

a 
professor 
of 

Ophthalmology 
and 

Visual Sciences, is another 
recipient of the Innovation 
Hub award. Petty is the 
principal 
investigator 

of a University research 
team working to improve 

ocular cancer therapy with 
semiconducting nanoparticles.

“In our preliminary studies, 

we have a couple papers on 
this. 
We 
have 
developed 

nanoparticles that generate 
toxins and what we can do is 
we can inject them into the 
eye and the nanoparticles 
have been developed so we can 
target the tumor cells in the 
eye,” Petty said.

In the future, Petty said 

he wants to make the drug 
available to human patients.

“What we’re going to be 

able to do with the money is 
get enough publications and 
data that if it works well in 
treating mice, we’ll be able 
to use it as an investigational 
drug,” Petty said. “The goal is 
to try to make this available to 
patients, and this will provide 
us, 
between 
fundamental 

research and clinical research, 
it will help us cross that gap.”

In 
early 
January, 
the 

finalists 
– 
whose 
initial 

proposals 
were 
due 
in 

September 
– 
gathered 
in 

downtown 
Ann 
Arbor 
to 

present their project proposals 
at the annual meeting of the 
external 
MTRAC 
oversight 

committee.

Those selected, spanning as 

far as Michigan Technological 
University to the University, 
received 
individual 
awards 

ranging 
from 
$75,000 
to 

$250,000 
with 
the 
goal 

of 
helping 
their 
products, 

which are already partially 
developed, reach the market 
and help patients as soon as 
possible.

WOLVE RINE OF THE WE E K

What is your ideal 
Valentine’s Day date?
“Going to Skyzone 
and jumping in 
trampolines with 
my significant 
other, grabbing 
something to eat, 
and then watching 
a movie.” 

LSA junior Nate Baker


the 
University 
proposed 
a 

$1,000 increase to the starting 
salary for lecturers in 2019, 
followed by a $750 increase in 
2020 and then $500 in 2021.

Appointments 
Committee 

Vice Chair Brooke Lennox, an 

LSA sophomore, sponsored the 
resolution.

“Showing as much support as 

we can is important,” she said.

Three 
bylaw 
amendments 

were 
also 
passed, 
one 
of 
 

which requires representatives 
to 
use 
gender-inclusive 

language during official LSA SG 
events and in communications.

Diversity Affairs Committee 

Chair Corrina Lee, an LSA 
sophomore, 
offered 
an 

“unfriendly amendment,” as 
she felt a phrase mandating 
 

LSA 
SG 
members 
“shall 
 

make an effort to use gender-
inclusive language” was too 
“flippant.”

“I appreciate the sentiment 

behind 
this,” 
she 
said. 

“Obviously we should all be 

using inclusive language, but 
seeing the way it’s worded 
I reject it. It’s seems easy to 
disregard. I don’t feel like that’s 
a real culture change.”

Secretary Hunter Arcand, an 

LSA senior, disagreed.

“I don’t think this clause 

is flippant whatsoever,” he 
said. “When people make an 
 

effort, it makes a massive 

difference.”

The amendment ultimately 

failed, and the LEO resolution 
passed with 23 votes in favor 
and none against. 

The 
two 
other 
bylaws 

amendments

ballots awarded to the person 
listed as the voter’s next choice.

President Barack Obama, and 
Fayrouz Saad, former director 
of Detroit’s immigrant affairs 
who would be the first Muslim 
woman in Congress if elected.

This 
decision 
comes 
the 

same week that Randy Bryce, a 

Wisconsin Democrat running 
for the seat of House Speaker 
Paul Ryan, R-Wis., announced 
he would unionize his own 
campaign 
staff. 
Bryce 
said 

his campaign’s contract is the 
first 
collective 
bargaining 

contract by campaign workers 
— Haberman’s is the first such 
congressional 
campaign 
in 

Michigan.

“The more folks we can help 

stay in the field, the better off 
the Democratic Party and the 
progressive 
movement 
will 
 

be,” Meg Reilly, vice president 
of 
the 
Campaign 
Workers 

Guild, said to the Huffington 
Post.

Though 
U.S. 
unionization 

was at a record low of 10.7 
percent for the year, non-
technical 
services 
saw 
an 

increase of 90,000 in union 
members, 
according 
to 
the 

Bureau of Labor Statistics. 

The Campaign Workers Guild 

is looking to further increase 
non-technical union workers 

by targeting young campaign 
workers who are usually short-
term and sometimes unpaid. 
According to Bloomberg, the 
CWG aims for a collective 
bargaining 
agreement 
that 

would apply to all Democratic 
campaigns for all government 
sectors.

Janice 
Fine, 
Rutgers 

University 
labor 
studies 

professor, has worked on both 
local 
and 
national 
election 

campaigns. She is supportive 
of the CWG goals because 
workers 
often 
overexert 

themselves without sufficient 
compensation.

“There’s no question that it’s 

exploitative work,” Fine said to 
Bloomberg. “It’s premised on 
the idea that young people will 
work 24-7 in a selfless – and 
often dangerously selfless – 
way, and that culture has been 
passed on for generations.”

Haberman agreed and said 

as a Democrat, it is his job to 
protect and “champion” the 
rights of workers.

“My staff had heard about 

the 
formation 
of 
the 
new 

Campaign Workers Guild and 
brought it to my attention,” he 
said. “They expressed a desire 
to send a message that we stand 
in solidarity with campaign 
workers 
who 
dedicate 

their 
careers 
to 
promoting 

progressive values at all levels 
of government. For me, this was 
the right thing to do,” he said. 

However, many of the low-

paid and non-paid staffers are 
often student interns. As of 
right now, Haberman said he is 
unsure if they will benefit from 
this change.

“The campaign is working 

with the CWG to determine if 
any, changes or effects this will 
have on those students who are 
in our fellowship program. It 
is our understanding that the 
unionization will only affect 
full-time staff of the campaign.”

or receptors that have been 
shown to be linked to cocaine 
addiction.

When the team used drugs to 

block these receptors, the rats 
no longer sought food when 
they heard the trigger sound; 
however, Ferrario said this 
type of drug would not work 
for humans given how large an 
effect a healthy lifestyle and 
environment have on obesity 
in people. Nonetheless, the 
findings could still be a “huge 
step” to understanding obesity.

In 
an 
email 
interview, 

Ferrario stated these findings 
could be very significant if they 
could find out how individual 
differences relate to this kind 
of cue-triggered eating.

“Our data suggest that a 

one-size-fits-all approach may 
not be best when it comes to 
maintaining a healthy weight, 
but 
rather 
that 
prevention 

and 
treatment 
strategies 

may need to be tailored to 
individual 
needs,” 
Ferrario 

wrote. 
“We 
can 
use 
our 

obesity-prone and -resistant 
rodents as tools to work out 
changes in the brain that 
influence feeding and potential 
strategies, both behavioral and 
pharmacological, to dampen 
and reverse unhealthy eating 

patterns.”

Rackham student Rebecca 

Derma, who works in Ferrario’s 
lab, stated in an email interview 
that she believed obesity is a 
very important area of research, 
and Ferrarrio’s research struck 
a chord with her.

“Carrie’s research examining 

the 
psychological 
and 

neurobiological 
contributors 

to obesity struck a chord with 
me,” Derman wrote. “Whereas 
addictions 
are 
rather 
rare 

disorders, obesity is a very 
common disorder and it is on 
the rise. It’s prevalence (both 
in 
human 
and 
nonhuman 

animals 
- 
pets 
and 
urban 

wildlife) 
to 
me, 
suggests 

that it arises from a rather 

‘normal’ 
appetitive 
process. 

This is of particular interest 
to me because it allows us to 
explore the more naturalistic 
and perhaps more generally 
relevant forms of ‘maladaptive’ 
appetitive behaviors.”

There is a lot more research to 

be done, and Ferrario said there 
are already people working on 
extrapolating on this research. 
The studies were only done on 
male rats, and Rackham student 
Yanaira 
Alonso-Caraballo, 

who also works in Ferrario’s 
lab, has been studying how 
naturally occurring changes in 
female reproductive hormones 
enhance cue-triggered food-
seeking in obesity prone rats. 
Alonso-Caraballo studies the 

different responses that occur 
when rats are in different 
phases of their ovulation and 
menstrual cycles.

“For the past 15 years, we 

have been mainly studying 
males, and females are basically 
the 
understudy,” 
Alonso-

Carabello said. “So a lot of 
the drugs and treatments that 
are out there have been done 
on males, and this is across 
all sciences. My goal moving 
forward is to keep on studying 
females and the female brain 
and the female behavior, and 
understanding the very basic 
mechanisms of behaviors and 
how the brain works.”

Derman stated she felt the 

research was important on 

two different levels in order to 
increase human well-being and 
uncover important truths about 
reality.

“First, 
it 
is 
important 

because 
uncovering 
the 

mechanism that drive obesity 
will help us treat and prevent 
this disorder and ultimately 
bring us closer to maximizing 
humanities 
collective 
well-

being,” Derman wrote. “And 
second, from a basic science 
perspective, understanding the 
neurobiology of behavior is a 
profoundly valuable endeavor 
because there is intrinsic value 
in uncovering the nature of 
reality, whether or not it results 
in a direct impact on human 
life.”

productive and important.”

Deloria 
began 
teaching 

this winter at Harvard in 
a 
transitional 
semester, 

teaching a graduate seminar 
in Native-American studies. 
Beginning next semester, he 
will teach an introductory 
course on Native-American 
studies — which would look 
similar 
to 
the 
course 
he 

taught at the University — 
and an introductory seminar 
for graduate students on the 
same subject. Deloria looks 
forward to his time at Harvard 
and hopes to accomplish the 
similar goals he achieved at 
the University.

“At Harvard, I am hoping 

to do a little more of the 
same,” Deloria said. “It’s a 
different 
institution 
with 

different challenges and it’s 
an institution that is really 
interested in Native-American 
issues.”

Deloria 
discussed 
his 

latest scholarly project on 
researching global indigenous 
people 
in 
countries 
such 

as 
Taiwan, 
Australia 
and 

Scandinavia. He said Harvard 
will allow him to further 
explore these areas.

“I’ve got a real interest in 

global indigenous connections 
and some experience with 
Taiwan and Australia and 
Scandinavia,” 
Deloria 
said. 

“Harvard is a place where I 
think it could be interesting 
to 
learn 
about 
indigenous 

groups.”

History department chair 

James 
Cook, 
University 

professor 
of 
history 
and 

American studies, discussed 
the close relationship he has 
had with Deloria and the 

lasting effect he had on his 
colleagues. Cook and Deloria 
began 
their 
time 
at 
the 

University around the same 
time in 2001 and Cook said 
they have since been close 
colleagues and friends.

“We have supported each 

other’s work in many ways.” 
Cook said. “I am very sad about 
that, he is one of my closest 
friends and colleagues here 
and I understand why this was 
a good move for him and really 
wish him well.”

Deloria 
comes 
from 
a 

Native-American family with 
his father and grandfather as 
Native-American intellectual 
leaders, setting the foundation 
for 
his 
love 
of 
Native-

American history. He often 
brings his Native-American 
legacy into the classroom. 
Rackham 
student 
Matthew 

Villeneuve described how he 
would accompany his lectures 

with Sioux songs, bison hides 
and by singing protest ballads 
on his guitar.

“Phil’s not just one of the 

best scholars of American-
Indian history, but he is also 
a 
tremendously 
creative 

thinker in American Studies, 
and a wonderful mentor and 
teacher,” Villeneuve said in an 
email interview. “I’m guessing 
these kinds of folks don’t 
come along very often. I’m 
excited to see the intellectual 
community that Phil is able 
to gather in Cambridge and I 
can’t wait to see what he does 
with the place.”

Deloria 
looks 
forward 

to making a difference at 
Harvard and beyond.

“It’s a chance to make a 

difference at a big institution 
and to make a difference like 
this at this institution, is to 
make a difference in the wider 
world.” Deloria said.

of #MeToo, accusing actors, 
politicians, university officials 
and men of sexual assault and 
harassment across the nation.

At 
the 
House 
meeting, 

state 
Rep. 
Kristy 
Pagan, 

D-Canton, 
spoke 
in 
favor 

of 
improved 
funding 
for 

prevention education as well 
as a potential requirement 
 

for 
health 
care 
facilities 

to 
ensure 
all 
minors 
are 

aware of their rights during 
examinations, 
specifically 

that they may be accompanied 
by 
a 
parent, 
guardian 
or 
 

other 
adult 
during 
the 

examination.

Pagan also noted the state of 

Michigan currently allocates 
no funding for rape prevention 
and 
services 
within 
the 

budget for the Department of 
Health and Human Services. 
She proposed a $1 million 
allocation 
from 
the 
state 

budget for these services. This 
would require an increase in 
federal funding in Michigan.

“We are one of the only 

states in the country that 
does not have any money 
going toward sexual assault 
prevention,” 
Pagan 
said. 

“This leaves a striking gap in 
providing these services to 
nonprofits. We are only able to 
fund 18 nonprofits that focus 
on sexual assaults throughout 
our entire state. And these 
18 nonprofits are only able 
to cover 33 of Michigan’s 83 
counties.” 

State 
Rep. 
Erika 
Geiss, 

D-Taylor, 
spoke 
on 
the 

current lack of protection for 
survivors of sexual assault 
and harassment on college 

campuses. 
She 
proposed 

the creation of a Title IX 
ombudsman 
within 
the 

Department of Civil Rights 
who would become a resource 
for 
survivors 
and 
help 

protect them from potential 
retaliation or intimidation.

“Creating 
a 
Title 
IX 

ombudsman would help to 
strengthen the laws on Title 
IX 
reporting 
and 
ensure 

that victims and survivors 
are given the support and 
help that they need,” Geiss 
said. “Creating this Title IX 
ombudsman would reaffirm 
Michigan’s 
commitment 
to 

protecting 
those 
who 
are 

victims of unwanted sexual 
behaviors.”

State Rep. Donna Lasinski, 

D-Scio 
Township, 
argued 

in favor of eliminating the 
current “10-year statute of 
limitations for charging or 

filing a civil lawsuit against 
a 
person 
suspected 
of 

committing a sexual assault on 
a person under the age of 16,” 
according to the Detroit Free 
Press.

“We know that for adults, 

the processing of a sexual 
 

assault is very difficult,” she 
said. “For those who are minors 
when the assault occurred, we 
know that these are some of 
our most vulnerable citizens. It 
is disgusting and inhumane to 
take away a child’s innocence 
and to rush them through (the) 
process of what it takes for 
them to reconcile what has 
happened to them.”

Lasinski also proposed a 

law should be put in place to 
require health facilities to 
begin investigations of a report 
of sexual assault against a 
health professional within 48 
hours.

“W

ho here knows 
who their state 
representative 

is?” my professor asked on the 
first day of class.

As I quickly scanned the 

room, I was startled. Not a 
single hand was in the air. You 
might be wondering what class 
I was in, rationalizing that 
maybe this lack of knowledge 
is acceptable in Introduction to 
Biology or Calculus 2. But you 
would be sorely disappointed, 
just as I was, to know that the 
class was Electoral Politics in 
the Developing World, a class 
taken by most political science 
majors as one of their final 
requirements for graduation. In 
a population with a relatively 
high need for basic political 
knowledge, not one person could 
name their state representative. 
His name is Adam Zemke, by the 
way, but that could not be further 
from the point. For progressives 
to reverse the causes of a Donald 
Trump presidency, they must 
not once again fall into the trap 
of throwing away local elections.

Under 
President 
Barack 

Obama, Democrats had a net 
loss of 1,042 state and federal 
posts. 
Read 
that 
number 

again 
for 
good 
measure: 

1,042. Democrats lost nine 
senate seats, 62 seats in the 
House of Representatives, 11 
governorships and over 900 
seats 
in 
state 
legislatures. 

For all of the unity and hope 
tied to Obama’s campaigns, 
it 
is 
startlingly 
evident 

that those themes did not 
translate 
to 
Democratic 

candidates 
everywhere. 
In 

fact, the opposite happened. 
Republicans running in local 
elections relied on emotional 
appeals, in direct contrast to 
those of Obama.

Using 
racism, 
anti-

Semitism, 
conspiracy 

theories and lies, politicians 
in 
these 
local 
elections 

started 
a 
transformation 

in 
the 
American 
public. 

In 
Oklahoma, 
the 
state 

legislature mandated teachers 
present 
the 
shortcomings 

of evolutionary theory. In 
North 
Carolina, 
the 
state 

voted to deny using studies 
that cited rising sea levels in 
formulating policy. Finally, in 
Georgia, the legislature had 
a four-hour meeting where 
at one point it was proposed 
that Obama was capable of 
mind control. These are just 
a few of the truly absurd 
actions local politicians have 
taken recently. The lack of 
accountability in American 
politics is striking, and it by 
no means started on Nov. 8, 
2016. In the wake of Obama’s 
resounding win, Democrats 
lost sight of the influence local 
races can have. Having the 
presidency was not enough to 
stop the destruction of trust 
in our political institutions. 
The Pew Research Center 
found that fewer Americans 
trust the government now 
than 
after 
the 
Watergate 

scandal. Democrats allowed 
Republicans 
to 
relentlessly 

attack our institutions, and 
we are seeing the effects of 
that now.

There is a lazy narrative 

out there that these baseless 
attacks, or “alternative facts,” 
were born out of a Trump 
presidency. The truth is that 
Trump was a consequence of 
almost a decade of looking the 
other way, and not a cause of 
compulsive lying in politics. 
While it is true that all of the 
examples above come from 
states 
with 
a 
Republican 

majority, Democrats are to 
blame too. Instead of fighting 
for truth and facts at every 
juncture, they chose instead to 
save their time and resources 
for only the biggest of races. 
In the congressional district 
where I grew up (Pa.-18), I 
did not get a chance to cast a 
meaningful vote for my U.S. 
representative 
because 
the 

Republican 
incumbent 
ran 

unopposed. That congressman, 
Tim Murphy, resigned this 
past October after reports 
came out that he urged his 
mistress to have an abortion, 

despite his staunch pro-life 
advocacy. Even though it was 
highly unlikely for a Democrat 
to win in the district, at least 
contesting the seat might have 
led to a more rigorous vetting 
of Murphy. More generally, 
by failing to contest races all 
over the country, Democrats 
allow Republicans to erode 
our democracy one election at 
a time.

There 
are 
signs 
that 

everyday 
progressives 

started 
to 
recognize 
the 

value in consistent grassroots 
organization. 
Groups 
like 

Indivisible, 
Swing 
Left, 

Flippable, Run for Something 
and many more are equipping 
citizens who want to get 
involved in politics with the 
tools to make differences in 
their communities. There have 
been some recognizable gains 
because of this transition, 
such as the performance of 
Democrats up and down the 
ballot in Virginia; however, the 
Democratic establishment has 
not fully embraced a 50-state 
approach. 
In 
a 
Montana 

election for the House of 
Representatives, 
where 
the 

Republican candidate body-
slammed 
a 
reporter, 
the 

Democratic establishment had 
been outspent by $4 million. 
The Republican candidate won 
because the election was not 
played on a level field because 
of a lack of interest from 
the 
Democratic 
leadership. 

Members of the Democratic 
Party must demand that the 
establishment step up and 
match their fervor. Finally, my 
home district, the one where 
the Republican just resigned in 
scandal, sees the Democratic 
candidate 
only 
trailing 
by 

three points. The Democratic 
Party must be learning their 
lesson, right? They have to be 
all in, right? Nope. Republican 
outside groups have spent $3 
million to the Democrats’…$0. 
Go figure.

In defense of hook-up culture

W

hen 
a 
former 

contestant 
on 

“The 
Apprentice” 

became a White House staff 
aide, it felt like the world was 
beginning to turn on its side 
(though, to be fair, the star of 
the show becoming president 
is probably the primary reason 
for 
why 
everything’s 
gone 

lopsided). When that same 
contestant is dismissed from 
the White House staff and then 
airs her complaints and fears 
about her former employer on 
“Celebrity Big Brother” to an 
E! News anchor, it feels like 
someone set the world ablaze.

The complaints of Omarosa 

Manigault (known, inanely, as 
the mononymous “Omarosa”), 
the 
former 
director 
of 

communications for the Office 
of Public Liaison, could be 
internalized in several ways, 
all of which indicate the 
bizarre state of media and 
news consumption.

In one aspect, it can be 

viewed as her warning to the 
American people via the popular 
reality television show about 
the hazardous ineptitude of the 
incumbent administration.

However, it can also be 

perceived as — and this is 
the way I processed such 
bizarre news headlines — that 
entertainment 
has 
seeped 

into 
the 
stratosphere 
of 

the 
already-hyperpartisan 

political climate. Or, instead 
of seeped, perhaps it has 
completely 
devoured 
it, 

distorting the face of politics 
into something that is as 
harrowing as it is amusing.

After seeing a headline 

as asinine as “Omarosa talks 
Trump 
on 
‘Celebrity 
Big 

Brother’: ‘I was haunted by 
tweets 
every 
single 
day,’ 

I recalled how a certain 
entertainer 
prophetically 

tried to tell the world, or 
at least his fans, of this 
disastrous path.

Omarosa’s 
dark 

proclamation on reality TV 
evoked a certain album that 

haunted my summer days, the 
stinging and searing “Pure 
Comedy” by folk-rock singer 
Father John Misty. The blend 
of masterful cultural criticism 
with the resonance of someone 
who’s been left exhausted and 
beleaguered by the political 
climate was both cathartic and 
blisteringly incisive.

As though with a scalpel, 

Father 
John 
Misty’s 
clean 

dissection of today’s politics 
came from a messy place, 
especially 
in 
songs 
such 

as 
“Total 
Entertainment 

Forever,” where he highlights 
how entertainment saturates 
existence, 
rich 
or 
poor, 

describing an Oculus Rift-like 
VR system that elucidates every 
desire through a screen.

Every 
dystopian 
image 

rendered is clearly rooted in 
the messiness of a culture 
whose politics have become 
circus-like. 
Two 
summers 

ago, 
after 
the 
nomination 

of President Donald Trump 
at the Republican National 
Convention, I saw Father John 
Misty at Camden, New Jersey’s 
XPoNential music festival.

He 
bitterly 
improvised 

a cover of Leonard Cohen’s 
“Bird On a Wire” with new 
lyrics slamming the fact that 
a “reality god” was inching 
closer to the White House, 
and that we, the crowd and 
proverbial 
“people,” 
were 

to blame for fostering an 
environment that commodified 
politics vis-à-vis an obsession 
with entertainment.

After the festival, which 

I 
went 
to 
solely 
for 
his 

appearance, I was miffed by 
his departure after singing one 
song that he didn’t really write. 
 

Yet 
his 
words 
have 

continued to linger in my 
head, and the only way to 
internalize the increasingly 
fatuous nature of our world 
has been through his music. 
It is almost as though I have 
begun reading every headline 
as inextricably tied to his 
omens 
as 
they 
manifested 

themselves in a White House 
run by clueless celebrities and 
far right zealots.

Though I doubt Father 

John Misty is the only cultural 
critic to point out the troubling 
nature of our discourse, I 
referenced his music in the 
hopes that perhaps it would 
shed light on how our insatiable 
need for entertainment has 
transmuted politics.

Omarosa’s warning could 

signify the deeply troubling 
nature 
of 
a 
White 
House 

currently teetering the world 
on the brink of apocalypse. But 
we already knew that.

Instead, 
her 
appearance 

on “Celebrity Big Brother,” 
whispering to Ross Mathews 
while she chokes back tears, 
featured the staple histrionics 
of any reality TV show as 
she exploits the fears of the 
American people. Do we blame 
the advent of capitalism for 
pushing for every last view out 
of the American people, or do 
we blame ourselves?

However, the point is that 

Father John Misty’s prophetic 
vision, 
one 
which 
doesn’t 

stand alone but, invariably, is 
constantly floating in my mind, 
has barely even been approached.

We continue to frame every 

political act in such overly 
sensationalist terms that it 
feels like a globe is falling 
off the edge with a racist, 
xenophobic 
world 
leader 

at the helm. Will we begin 
flouting this hedonism in the 
hopes 
that 
entertainment 

and politics will no longer 
be inextricable? Or are we to 
continue being complacent in 
our own decadent demise?

Perhaps this is the next 

move 
of 
the 
resistance: 

distilling 
politics 
and 

entertainment 
and 

renormalizing the culture in 
the hopes that we will never 
again elect a “reality god.”

“

NOTABLE QUOTABLE

I was recently asked in an interview 

what its like to be a gay 
athlete in sports. I said that it’s 

exactly like being a straight athlete. 
Lots of hard work but usually done 

with better eye brows. ”

W

hen I was a little 
girl, I had a very 
clear 
picture 
of 

how my romantic life would 
turn out. Here’s what would 
happen: When I was about 18 
or 19, I would meet the love of 
my life. He would come home, 
meet my parents, impress them 
and, after a few years of dating, 
we would get married. It would 
be an easy and simple system, 
following a moral code of 
conduct in parts inspired both 
by the Bible and the Disney 
princess movies I was addicted 
to watching.

As I grew older, the media I 

consumed changed from Snow 
White and “The Young Women 
of Faith Bible” to more mature 
romantic 
books 
and 
films, 

mostly romantic comedies such 
as “27 Dresses” and “Hitch.” 
With this change also came 
an alteration to my perception 
of sex and dating. All of the 
sudden, the clear picture of 
my future romantic life turned 
into a story of how I would 
date multiple awful men before 
finding The One. Sex early on in 
the relationship was imperative 
to the relationship’s survival, 
and I would have to walk the 
fine line between slut and 
prude. Though less easy and 
simple, this new system would 
also follow a sexist moral code 
of rules and regulations on how 
to act and behave in potentially 
romantic situations.

And then I was old enough 

to participate in both of the 
systems I had created in my 
head, and I began to realize just 
how unappealing they really 
were. I could either pressure 
myself into getting into a long-
term relationship at a super 
young age, or I could play 
romantic games with everyone 
I dated until I found someone 
with whom I could cut through 
the bullshit, holding myself 
to ridiculous beauty and diet 
expectations until then. So, 
though every adult I’d grown up 
with was shaming millennials’ 
“hookup culture,” I have to say 
I’ve found much more freedom 

in 
this 
supposed 
immoral 

system than in any of the other 
dating systems presented to me 
by the media and the rules of 
our parents.

The freedom I have found 

comes from the fact that in 
regard to dating, none of us 
really seem to know what the 
hell we’re doing. Some of us are 
hooking up with lots of people, 
and some of us are intentionally 
single and abstinent. The rules 
that governed the romantic 
lives of our parents don’t seem 
to apply anymore, so we’re kind 
of making things up as we go. 
And honestly, I think it’s in this 
confusion that really makes 
hook-up culture great. People in 
romantic/sexual relationships 
are forced to talk about their 
relationship status and what 
that status looks like to them. 
They’re forced to really think 
about what their expectations 
are and what they want from 
a romantic/sexual partner or 
partners. From my experience, 
I’ve learned that “casual” and 
“dating” look a lot different 
to different people, and what 
might be “casual” for one 
person might be more serious 
for another. And honestly, even 
though 
they’re 
undoubtedly 

awkward, I’m here for these 
open 
and 
communicative 

discussions. They prepare us 
for when, or if, we decide to 
enter into more serious, long-
term relationships. They make 
us better listeners and also 
better friends.

Our 
generation 
has 

seen a sexual and romantic 
revolution 
comparable 
only 

to the sexual revolution of the 
1960s. In our lifetime, we have 
witnessed the implementation 
of marriage equality, the rise 
of 
discussions 
surrounding 

consent on college campuses 
and the #MeToo movement, 
all of which have transformed 
the ways we view romance, 
sex and relationships. In my 
experience, the generational 
gap between our parents and 
us regarding attitudes towards 
LGBTQ relationships is the 

size of the Grand Canyon, and 
the universal idea that we are 
all sexual beings who wish 
for romantic happiness is very 
much in question. Suddenly, 
the conversation surrounding 
our romantic lives isn’t as open 
and shut as it once was, and I 
celebrate that.

I’ve 
read 
articles 

criticizing 
hook-up 
culture 

for dehumanizing women and 
for destroying young people’s 
abilities to have long-term, 
meaningful 
relationships. 

However, I would argue that a 
more liberal attitude toward sex 
and relationships has created a 
landscape where young people 
feel more able to express their 
wants and desires. It’s this 
more liberal attitude that I see 
bringing about the ability to 
discuss the #MeToo movement 
without the shame that was 
once 
attached 
to 
sexual 

assault and harassment. And 
apparently, since the divorce 
rate is dropping, I would 
advocate that folk’s ability to 
foster 
healthy 
relationships 

isn’t dying out, but becoming 
stronger. I would argue hook-
up culture’s liberal attitudes 
toward sex and romance are 
creating an atmosphere that 
makes sex and romance safer.

So, 
this 
Valentine’s 

Day I hope everyone does 
exactly what they want to do, 
uninfluenced by any societal 
expectations of what they 
should want. If that means 
looking for a casual hook-up, 
having a romantic date with 
a long-term partner, being 
alone or spending time with 
friends because you aren’t 
interested in romance or sex 
now or really ever, then I hope 
you do that. We are living in a 
time of unprecedented change 
and confusion in regard to our 
personal lives, and I hope you 
take advantage of that and do 
exactly what is comfortable 
for you.

Elena Hubbell is an LSA senior and 

a Senior Opinion Editor.


Taylor Bump’s home in Gulf 

Port, Fla. is almost 1200 miles from 
Ann Arbor.

Situated right on the azure 

waters of Tampa Bay, it’s about 
a 40-minute drive from South 
Florida’s softball stadium. The 
last thing anyone would associate 
with the house is softball. Yet by 
a chance event, the sport became 
both the nexus and the antithesis 
of the freshman third baseman’s 
house, all in one afternoon.

It was after the Michigan softball 

team had wrapped up the USF 
Wilson-Demarini 
Tournament. 

If there was one word to describe 
the up-and-down weekend, tiring 
would be a fitting choice. Five 
games in three days, smack dab in 
the middle of midterms, the players 
had a lot on their plate. Back home 
in Michigan, however, an incessant 
winter storm had no plans to stop.

Coach Carol Hutchins broke the 

news to the Wolverines: their flight 
back to Detroit had been cancelled. 
They would need to stay the night 
in Tampa after having already 
spent more than three days there 
before. That would give them only 
two full days back home until they 
had to go back on the road and play 
in the Big Ten/ACC Challenge.

“Now what are we going to do?” 

Hutchins wondered.

The team had 24 hours to kill, 

over 20 hungry coaches and players 
to feed and no hotel booked. In the 
midst of all that, Hutchins didn’t 
turn to a coach, captain or another 
veteran, but rather to Bump, fresh 
off her first collegiate start at third 

base, for advice.

“Well, I asked her, ‘Taylor, if you 

were stuck in Tampa with all your 
softball friends, what would there 
be to do?’ ” Hutchins said. “I was 
wondering what we might do. Go 
to Busch Gardens? Go to the beach? 
Walk around?”

Bump had no hesitation. Even 

as a freshman, she knew that she 
had lots of camaraderie within 
Michigan softball and a tight 
family at worst an hour’s drive 
away. The third baseman goes as 
far as describing her teammates as 
“basically my family now.” So, just 
like that she picked up the phone.

“Hey mom, how do you feel 

about having the whole team over?”

Bump says her mom showed no 

hesitation.

Fast forward a few hours, and 

it’s easy to see that Hutchins, Bump 
and the rest of the team made the 
right choice. The players traded 
in sweaty uniforms for swimwear 
and peace of mind. Some of the 
assistant coaches and the seniors 
stopped by a local Publix and 
bought the fixings for a makeshift 
ice cream and snack bar — a 
welcome indulgence for everyone 
from Bump to Hutchins.

But therein lies exactly the 

beauty of the softball team’s Tampa 
excursion. Even though the players 
and coaches didn’t follow the most 
efficient schedule or regimen for 
the day, the opportunity to relax 
and bond off the field over the 
course of a long season provides 
them a chance to grow closer as 
normal people: without being 
forced to work together by the rigid 
construct of college athletics.

Game-saving plays against Spartans display Cecconi’s growth

“Don’t let the puck cross the 

line.”

That was the only thought 

going through Joseph Cecconi’s 
mind late in Saturday night’s 
game against Michigan State.

With under three minutes 

left in regulation, sophomore 
goaltender 
Hayden 
Lavigne 

had just made two critical 
saves to preserve the Michigan 
hockey team’s 3-2 lead over the 
Spartans. But the rebound was 
loose and the netminder was 
out of position to make a play.

Michigan 
State 
forward 

Cody Milan backhanded the 
puck toward a wide-open net, 
and suddenly, the Spartans 
were 
milliseconds 
from 

tying the game and spoiling 
the 
Wolverines’ 
hopes 
for 

a regulation win and three 
points.

But in swooped Cecconi, and 

the junior defenseman would 
follow through on his own 
command.

Originally, Cecconi wanted 

to swat the puck away from the 
goal, but as he fell backward into 
the net, he realized he couldn’t. 
Instead, he caught the puck in 
his right hand and caressed it 
to his chest. Recognizing where 
he was, Cecconi pushed the 
puck out before it could cross 
the goal line — preventing, after 
further review, the game-tying 
goal.

“When it’s a scramble like 

that, everyone has to go back 
to the front of the net,” Cecconi 
said. “I was the closest guy to 
the net and Hayden was far out, 
so I just stepped right in there 
and made a save, I guess.”

The previous night, Cecconi 

was watching his teammates 
from the Munn Ice Arena 
stands 
in 
East 
Lansing, 

dejected after being called for 

a game misconduct and ejection 
for a high hit midway through 
the first period. Twenty-four 
hours later at Little Caesars 
Arena, 
the 
blueliner 
was 

making a heroic 
heads-up 
play 

to 
ultimately 

seal a Michigan 
victory 
in 
the 

annual “Duel at 
the D.”

Three 

minutes earlier, 
Cecconi was the 
first one down 
the ice with the 
puck, 
looking 

to make a play on the rush. A 
pinpoint cross-ice pass to a 
trailing Quinn Hughes resulted 
in a toe-drag from the freshman 
defenseman and the game-
winning goal.

Saturday 
night’s 
standout 

game was just an addition to 
an already-breakout season for 
Cecconi. His 16 points — four 
goals and 12 assists — and 69 
shots double his production in 

both categories 
from 
his 

freshman 
and 

sophomore 
campaigns.

Michigan 

coach 
Mel 

Pearson 
believes 
that 

while Cecconi’s 
offensive ability 
has always been 
there, he hadn’t 

been able to put it to good use 
until this season.

After two years of being 

underutilized, Pearson’s new 
systems suddenly gave Cecconi 
the 
chance 
to 
capitalize, 

especially on the power play. 

Focused on moving the puck 
low-to-high in the offensive 
zone, 
the 
Wolverines’ 

defensemen are now registering 
more shots from the blueline, 
affording 
Cecconi scoring 
opportunities 
aplenty. And he 
hasn’t put them 
to waste.

With 
crisp 

passes 
and 

strong 
blasts 

from the point, 
the Youngstown, 
N.Y. native has 
notched 
two 

goals and seven assists with the 
man advantage — comprising 
more than half of his points 
and more than any fellow 
defenseman with the extra 
man.

“He’s got good offensive 

skills, and I just think with that 
encouragement and confidence 
and the opportunity, he’s taken 
advantage of it,” Pearson said. 
“I think his growth in his game 

is huge.”

Pearson 

credits 
part 

of 
Cecconi’s 

offensive success 
to his elite puck 
management, 
seen 
in 
swift 

breakouts 
from 
the 

defensive zone, 
anticipating 
his 
teammates’ 

positions and passing “like a 
pro.”

On defense, his 6-foot-2, 

205-pound frame contributes 
to an increased reach with the 
stick and being able to body up 
opponents in scrums.

But Pearson was quickest to 

point to Cecconi’s increased 
maturity as a reason for recent 
achievements.

He 
believes 
Cecconi’s 

elevated poise started with 
winning a gold medal with 
Team USA at the 2017 U-20 
World Junior Championships 
— an experience that “really 
changed him.” Next was being 
named an assistant captain.

“Obviously, he is a leader, 

he wears a letter, he plays in 
every situation for us,” Pearson 
said. “He’s still young, but 
he’s matured a lot, and I think 
just 
taking 
on 
that 
added 

responsibility has helped him 
understand what being a leader 
is all about.”

Cecconi agrees. Offseason 

drills 
upped 
his 
technical 

game, 
but 
he 
considers 

his veteran presence on a 
roster mainly comprised of 
youngsters to have made the 
greatest difference.

“Being an upperclassman, I 

know that I have more of a role 
to play on the team,” Cecconi 
said. “I think that added to my 
confidence.”

And the “A” on Cecconi’s 

jersey is rubbing off on his 
teammates.

“Joe’s a great friend, a great 

teammate and a great player, 
obviously,” 
said 
Hughes, 

Cecconi’s 
defensive 
partner. 

“He just keeps things light, 
he’s not always serious … and 
he’s a very well-liked guy in the 
locker room.”

With intimidating defense, 

sharpshooting on the power 
play and veteran leadership, 
Cecconi has stepped up in a big 
way.

“He understands how the 

team counts on a guy like him,” 
Pearson said. “Especially when 
you’re given the opportunity, 
you have to seize it and take 
advantage of it, and he has.”

The Michigan softball team stayed in Florida on Sunday due to a snowstorm.

together, when we’re together on 

the field and in the locker room, we 
become really close, but when we’re 
together outside of the field and 
outside of the locker room, there’s 
just something, there’s a different 

kind of bond that forms,” Bump said. 
“And with trust and with laughter 
and with, just like, smiles, and just 
being around each other when 
we’re not around softball, it makes 
us really comfortable together.”

The Wolverines won’t have many 

more opportunities off the beaten 
path to build up true team bonds 
like they did on this sunny Sunday 
in Florida. The opportunity to 
establish a family, like the perfect 

pitch for a batter, is something 
Michigan can’t afford to miss out 
on. Right now, though, after an 
opportune snowstorm and Bump’s 
open home, it seems the Wolverines 
are on the right track.

Wolverines in trouble 
after loss to Minnesota

The No. 23 Michigan women’s 

basketball team is in a world of 
trouble.

After falling to Minnesota 

(9-4 Big Ten, 20-6 overall) 
on 
Wednesday, 
93-87, 
the 

Wolverines have now lost four 
of their last five. Against the 
Golden Gophers, as well as its 
other defeats during the slide, 
Michigan 
had 
opportunities 

to come out victorious, but 
couldn’t finish.

In 
the 
first 
period, 
the 

Wolverines (9-6, 20-8) shot 
an efficient 47 percent from 
the floor. Given Minnesota’s 
abysmal 27-percent clip from 
the field, it seemed rather 
peculiar for the Golden Gophers 
to be up 21-19 at the end of the 
frame.

The 
reason 
for 
this? 

Minnesota was able to force 
Michigan to commit eight fouls, 
affording the Golden Gophers 12 
free throws. The main culprit, 
junior guard Nicole Munger, 
racked up three fouls in the first 
quarter.

In the second frame, Michigan 

fouled only twice, giving up 
two Minnesota points from the 
charity stripe. However, the 
Golden Gophers were able to 
pick it up from the field, scoring 
24 points, to take a 45-40 
lead going into the half. The 
Wolverines’ deficit could largely 
be attributed to their dreadful 
defense and the lack of scoring 
from their big three scorers — 
senior guard Katelynn Flaherty, 
junior center Hallie Thome and 
Munger — combing for seven 
points; Thome and Munger were 
both held scoreless. 

“They went to that box-and-

one early where they were face-
guarding Kate,” said Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico. “At 
halftime, we felt like we were 
okay, even without her not 
scoring a lot because she had 
six assists and she was really 
moving the ball and finding 
them for high percentage shots.”

Flaherty came to form in the 

third quarter. The program’s 
all-time leading scorer tallied 
13 points, including nine from 
behind the arc. Thome added 
10 points of her own. This run 
allowed Michigan to take a 
73-69 lead into the final quarter.

But then, things fell apart.
The 
Wolverines’ 
defense 

continued to be poor, allowing 
Minnesota to start the quarter 
on an 11-2 run. Michigan made 
a slight run of its own after 
a Flaherty 3-pointer, taking 
an 83-82 lead, but the Golden 
Gophers prevailed.

“I thought we ran out of gas 

a little bit,” Barnes Arico said. 
“We had some critical turnovers 
late. They made the plays they 
had to down the stretch and we 
did not.”

There was one bright spot, it 

was the Wolverines’ bench play, 
which had to step up, as starting 
freshman forward Hailey Brown 
out with a yet-to-be-determined 
leg injury. Michigan’s bench 
scored 27, including a career 
high 19 from sophomore guard 
Akienreh Johnson.

“I thought (Johnson) did a 

great job of moving without the 
basketball and was able to get 
some easy buckets just because 
of her movement,” Barnes Arico 
said.

With the loss, the Wolverines 

are now in jeopardy of missing 
out on the NCAA Tournament, 
again. This would be the second 
straight year Michigan’s late-
season slide knocked them out 
of the tournament.

“We’ve been trying to stay 

really positive,” Barnes Arico 
said. “We talked about our 
seniors and juniors — Jillian 
(Dunston), Kate and Hallie — 
they need to make those plays 
down the stretch.”

The Wolverines now have 

only one regular season game 
left — on the road against No. 
10 Maryland. In a scenario 
that seemed unlikely just a few 
weeks ago, their postseason 
hopes just might depend on that 
matchup.

EVAN AARON/Daily

Fifth-year senior forward Duncan Robinson went 6-for-8 from three Wednesday.

HUNTER SHARF
Daily Sports Writer

Unlike many coaches, John 

Beilein doesn’t pretend every 
game is equal. When the No. 22 
Michigan men’s basketball team 
(10-5 Big Ten, 21-7 overall) was 
lackluster early this season, he 
posited that January and February 
were when it really mattered.

After 
last 
week’s 
loss 
to 

Northwestern, 
however, 
the 

Wolverines 
looked 
far 
from 

experiencing the February success 
they had enjoyed in years past.

Beilein had a solution: to give 

his seniors more opportunity to 
lead.

That’s exactly what happened 

Tuesday, and it worked.

Bolstered 
by 
36 
combined 

points 
from 
seniors 
Duncan 

Robinson and Muhammed-Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman, the Wolverines 
routed Iowa (3-12, 12-16), 74-57, at 
Crisler Center.

“It’s their time right now,” 

Beilein said. “I want them to shoot 
more, I want them to be more 
aggressive. It’s their time.

“Tonight, they saved the day.”
Though 
Michigan 
never 

seemed to lose control of the 
contest, forward Luka Garza 
scored Iowa’s first eight points 
of the second half and closed the 
team’s 13-point halftime deficit to 
single digits early in the frame.

But in his second-to-last game 

at Crisler, Robinson came up with 
a big-time answer. The forward 
drained a trio of 3-pointers 
on 
consecutive 
possessions, 

extending the Wolverines’ lead 
to 16 points midway through the 
second half.

From there, Michigan’s defense 

would ensure the victory, as it has 
all season. The Wolverines shot 
a middling 42 percent, but held 
the Hawkeyes — who lead the 
conference in per-game scoring — 
to their third-lowest output of the 
year.

“I was really proud of our 

defense, although the percentage 

(against us) isn’t great,” Beilein 
said. “They had 12 turnovers in the 
first half that allowed us to (pull) 
away a little bit.”

Early on, however, it was 

Iowa’s defense that was causing 
problems.

Taking 
a 
page 
from 

Northwestern’s 
playbook, 
the 

Hawkeyes utilized an extended 
zone to slow Michigan’s offense, 
forcing numerous attempts late in 
the shot clock.

“About ten minutes before the 

game, I saw the starting lineup 
and knew they were definitely 
going zone, and it was going to be a 
huge zone,” Beilein said. “We were 
ready, but it took us for a shock 
initially.”

After trailing 9-2 early, the 

Wolverines 
responded 
with 

aggressiveness in transition to 
tie the contest at 14 just minutes 
later — capped by a steal and score 
by Abdur-Rahkman off an Iowa 
inbounds pass.

That 
trend 
continued 
for 

the entire first half, which was 
dominated by sloppiness. The 
Hawkeyes committed 12 turnovers 
during the first 20 minutes. 
Michigan had five. Errant passes, 
shot clock violations and air balls 
were plentiful for both sides.

As sloppy as the half was, 

though, 
Abdur-Rahkman 

provided 
some 
beauty 
on 

Valentine’s Day. Slicing down 
the right side, he whipped a pass 
behind his back into the corner 
that shifted the Iowa defense to 
create an open triple for junior 
center Moritz Wagner, who would 
finish with 14 points.

“(Abdur-Rahkman) is really 

careful with what he does and is 
not afraid to make the extra pass,” 
Beilein said. “I think we’re going 
to really miss him in the future. … 
He’s as complete of a player than 
as you’d ever think he’d become.”

It was just one example of 

the impressive vision Abdur-
Rahkman flashed all night, as he 
finished with seven assists and no 
turnovers to go along with his 18 

points.

And in a game dominated by 

Michigan’s seniors, it’s fitting 
that three of those assists were to 
Robinson. With just over seven 
minutes to go in the first half, 
Abdur-Rahkman drove baseline 
to find a wide-open Robinson, who 
drained his first of six 3-pointers 
on the night.

“(As seniors) we don’t want 

to leave any stones unturned,” 
Robinson said. “We want to 
compete and play hard and make 
winning plays. I thought (Abdur-
Rahkman) played great tonight 
and found me in a lot of good 
situations.”

After a 16-point effort against 

Wisconsin, Robinson would finish 
with 18 points on 6-for-9 shooting 
Wednesday — a sign he’s starting 
to solve his offensive woes at the 
right time.

And as demonstrated by the 

win, Michigan might be too. 
That’s pivotal as the Wolverines 
prepare for a challenging stretch 
to close the regular season that 
includes Sunday’s showdown with 
No. 8 Ohio State.

Robinson and Abdur-Rahkman 

realize they have some power 
in the way their team ends 
the year. And in accordance to 
Beilein’s 
solution, 
Michigan’s 

seniors showed exactly that on 
Wednesday.

I-O-W-A

You 
remember 
Duncan 

Robinson, right?

The lanky marksman who set 

the world ablaze from beyond 
the arc when he transferred from 
Division III’s Williams College. 
The guy who captivated the 
fanbase and agitated opposing 
coaches. The fifth-year senior 
captain primed for the season of 
his life.

Senior guard Muhammad-Ali 

Abdur-Rakhman sure does.

“I was here when he was 

shooting like 70 percent as a 
sophomore,” 
Abdur-Rahkman 

said. “I’m glad he’s getting back to 
his old self and playing with the 
same confidence he had before.”

Robinson 
followed 
an 

offensive outburst on Sunday 
against Wisconsin — 16 points 
on 4-of-8 from 3-point range — 
with another electric shooting 
display Wednesday, helping lift 
Michigan past Iowa, 74-59.

These 
performances 
were 

nothing that Robinson and coach 
John Beilein didn’t see everyday 
in practice. 

But 
for 
the 
Wolverines’ 

opponents, this was a warning 
shot: Duncan Robinson is back, 
and subsequently, Michigan’s 
offense is on the ascent.

After draining three of his 

five 3-point attempts in the 
first half Wednesday, Robinson 
came back out in the second half 
on the prowl. With Michigan 
maintaining a steady lead, he 
put the game on ice, stamping 
the stretch of the game with 
3-pointers on three consecutive 
possessions.

With the Wolverines holding 

a 49-40 lead with 12 minutes 
remaining in the game, Robinson 
spotted up comfortably behind 
the Hawkeyes’ packed-in zone. 
Receiving the ball on the wing, 
he used the space to elevate and 
drain a 3-pointer. Then, with the 
flimsy zone offering ample space, 
Robinson knocked down another 
on the next possession from the 
same spot on the floor. By the 
time the third left his hand, the 
whole building knew it was in.

Iowa promptly called timeout, 

but it was too late. Robinson 
— mobbed at midcourt by his 
teammates — had put Michigan 
up 58-42, and the game to bed.

“Again, I watch everyday in 

practice,” Beilein said. “It’s the 
rep shooting drills where you 
have a minute to make so many 
threes. … He just goes ‘Bang, 
bang, bang, bang, bang.’ Some 
of our guys will have a good day 
and a bad day. He never misses 
the mark.”

Added Robinson: “When you 

make one or two, you kinda, at 
least in my head, have the green 
light for the next one even if it 
may be questionable. That’s just 
kind of how basketball is. Coach 
B instills a lot of confidence in 
me and so do my teammates. … 
He was actually on me after the 
game to shoot more.”

After 
Wednesday’s 
game, 

Robinson raised his 3-point 
shooting percentage to 38.6, 
inching closer and closer to his 
elite career norms.

His re-emergence offers a 

potent shooting threat on a team 
that has consistently struggled to 
maintain offensive consistency. 

And yet, the secondary and 
tertiary benefits of having a 
dead-eye 
shooter 
might 
be 

equally important.

The 
possession 
after 

Robinson’s 
long-distance 

bonanza, junior center Moritz 
Wagner grabbed an offensive 
board as Robinson sprinted to 
the near wing for a potential 
open three. As the Iowa defender 
frantically attacked Robinson to 
close out, Wagner instead fired 
the pass to Abdur-Rahkman at 
the top of the key. Using the space 
afforded to him by Robinson’s 
3-point threat, Abdur-Rahkman 
breezed down the lane for an 
easy lay-in.

The Duncan Robinson Effect 

is back, and not a moment too 
soon.

“We have a couple shooters 

on our team,” Abdur-Rahkman 
said. “But no one like Duncan, 
one of the best in the country. 
When he’s hot like that, it adds a 
different dynamic and a different 
look for teams to try to guard, 
and helps open up a lot of things 
for other people.”

Robinson 
has 
sporadically 

shown signs of breaking out of 
his prolonged slumber. Against 
Rutgers he hit four 3-pointers 
to spread the lead in that ugly 
defensive battle. Against Detroit 
Mercy 
and 
Alabama 
A&M, 

he combined for eight threes, 
though the competition level still 
left more to be desired.

But 
coupling 
his 
outing 

Sunday against Wisconsin with 
his 
performance 
Wednesday, 

this stretch could very well be a 
breakthrough at the biggest time 
of the year.

“(It’s) not really (hard to stay 

aggressive), 
especially 
when 

you’re a senior looking at your 
last games,” Robinson said. “I 
kinda look at it like it’s now or 
never. You see the time ticking 
out on your career, you’ve got 
to have a heightened sense of 
urgency about wanting to leave 
a mark.”

Queer art is thriving in the Ann Arbor community

Local 
activist 
Ariel 
Friedlander is ready to fuck 
shit up.
Of course, that’s not all she’s 
here for. But it summed up a 
lot from our interview this 
weekend.
“That’s what’s in the future. 
Having fun and fucking shit 
up,” Friedlander said. “I think 
that’s what we do best.”
The “we” to which she 
was 
referring 
is 
Radical 
Anticapitalist 
Deviants 
and 
Forum 
of 
United 
Nonconformists, 
a 
local 
collective dedicated to student 
activism and the creation of 
fun, safe and welcoming spaces 
for marginalized communities 
in Ann Arbor. Radfun was 
formed during the fall semester 
of last year with the goal of 
creating a space where students 
could come together and focus 
on things that they care about: 
one part social justice and one 
part having fun.
Friedlander herself is warm 
and approachable, manifesting 
in her mannerisms the same 
welcoming nature that she 
describes 
as 
characterizing 
Radfun. But, like Radfun, she’s 
also angry and passionate about 
defending what she cares about. 
She’s just making sure to direct 
that passion to the right places.
“When we create a safe space 
for queer and trans people 
of color, we’re also creating 
a radical space, because it’s 
so different from the social 
scene 
our 
campus 
offers,” 
Friedlander said. “We do like to 
use our parties and our social 
events as a way to create radical 
change.”
Radfun’s 
emphasis 
on 
radicalism 
and 
fun 
as 
“intertwined,” as Friedlander 
put it, brings up interesting 
questions 
about 
the 
intersection between these two 
things. For Friedlander and 
her fellow Radfun activists, 
this means seeking out ways 
to work toward social justice 
while making as much use of 
fun and creativity as possible 
in the process. In the past, 
Radfun has used both zines 
and 
fundraising 
parties 
as 
ways of working toward this 
goal. Their current and recent 
projects have also included 
working with the Stop Spencer 
Coalition and the Michigan 
Student Power Summit.
Zines 
in 
particular 
are 
among 
Radfun’s 
primary 
vehicles for creative political 
innovation. Commonly defined 

as 
self-published 
mini-
magazines (hence the name 
“zines”) with relatively small 
circulation, zines are popular 
in both artistic and social 
justice circles, and Radfun is no 
exception.
“I think art is so important 

to good activism, and I think 
it’s 
incredibly 
underused,” 
Friedlander said. “And Radfun 
is 
awesome 
because 
they 
see how art can play such an 
influential role in activism, 
reaching people on different 
levels that words just can’t. 
So creating these spaces and 
parties with music, or zines 
full of art and color, is really 
important and a way to reach 
people that is really useful and 
unique.”
Radfun is currently working 
on several zines, including 
one about queer safe spaces 
for people of color, and one 
visualizing what the University 
of Michigan might look like in 
a future in which everyone was 
truly welcome and included in 
the community.
“Art 
is 
always 
at 
the 
forefront 
of 
social 
justice 
issues,” Friedlander said. “Any 
social justice movement that’s 
successful has heavily relied 
on art … because we are often 
from a place of oppression and 
exclusion, and by using art, we 

can communicate those ideas. 
We can create that radical 
change that we couldn’t do any 
other way.”
She added that Radfun has 
been seeing a lot of art that 
“reflects the queer identity and 
queer experience.” President of 
Radfun Darian Razdar was also 
able to speak to the presence 
and significance of queer art in 
an email interview.
“Creativity and the arts have 
always been important for the 
queer community,” he wrote. 
“Through the arts we are able 
to make our voices heard, to 
affirm ourselves and folks like 
us. As queer people, we face an 
increasing amount of political, 
social, cultural and economic 
marginalization — so the arts 
both allows us to process 
the world in which we live 
and make a life for ourselves 
that feels more authentic and 
fulfilling than more capitalist 
styles of production.”
Radfun is doing a great deal 
of work on the University’s 
campus as far as combating 
injustice and advocating for 
queer people. However, beyond 
the campus itself, the larger 
queer community of Ann Arbor 
is 
also 
consistently 
active, 
particularly when it comes to 
the arts.
One long-established focal 
point for Ann Arbor’s queer 
community is Braun Court, 
a 
small, 
homey 
square 
of 
local businesses located in 
Kerrytown. 
The 
primary 
components of Braun Court 
are the Jim Toy Community 
Center, Trillium Real Estate, 
Aut Bar and Common Language 
Bookstore. The latter two are 
co-owned by married couple 
Martin Contreras and Keith 
Orr, who have been active 
players in the queer community 
of Ann Arbor for at least the last 
couple of decades.
From the outside, Common 
Language Bookstore is well-
lit and full of bright colors, an 
inviting sight nestled into the 
far-left corner of the snowy 
courtyard. As I walked up to it 
for the first time, a cheery ’60s 
pop song began emanating from 
the speakers of its next-door 
neighbor, Aut Bar, which felt 
like it added even more spirit 
and character to the previously 
silent street block.
You barely have to step inside 
to see that Common Language 
is any true bookstore lover’s 
dream. It’s cozy and vibrant, 
with walls and shelves spanned 
by a broad selection of both 
vintage and brand-new books 
— Nadine Hubbs’s “Rednecks, 
Queers, 
& 
Country 
Music”

“When we 

create a safe space 

for queer and 

trans people of 

color, we’re also 

creating a radical 

space, because 

it’s so different 

from the social 

scene our campus 

offers”

There was a moment years 
ago when I felt attacked, not 
intentionally, but in the way 
that an offhand comment by 
someone at the table next to you 
at a restaurant might strike you 
rather peculiarly, as if a nugget 
of truth you had neglected your 
whole life took the form of a small 
bug that creepily crawled inside 
your ear, planted itself there 
and birthed a number of smaller 

bugs that ravaged your thoughts. 
The attack came in the form of 
a truism, or as close to a truism 
that an opinion can get, uttered 
by a friend: That if I was such a 
passionate listener of music, I 
could surely name one song that 
made me emotional. The fact was, 
I couldn’t.
Sure, there were songs that 
made me feel lost in space, if only 
for a moment. George Gershwin’s 
“Rhapsody in Blue” and the 
sudden break that occurs midway 
through 
Vampire 
Weekend’s 
“Hannah Hunt” both came to 

mind immediately. But I would 
be lying if I were to declare that 
either song or really anything 
in my life I had heard up to that 
point, on a wintery Feb. mid-
afternoon in 2015, had struck me 
to my physiological core.
Troye Sivan’s “My My My!” 
might just be the first song to 
do that. It’s a bubbly pop song, 
constructed from the bare bones 
that have defined the genre: 
verse-chorus-verse-chorus-
bridge-chorus. Its three minutes 
and 25 seconds feel specifically 
engineered to be just short of 

satisfying, the only solution for 
which is to hit repeat. But more 
importantly, it’s a shameless 
anthem of queer love, one that 
works as an uplifting sequel to 
Sivan’s song “Heaven,” which 
appeared on his first album Blue 
Neighbourhood.
“Heaven” 
details 
Sivan’s 
journey 
coming 
out, 
his 
reckoning with his moderately 
religious upbringing — like me, 
he’s Jewish, but unlike me he 
attended an Orthodox school. 
Sivan noted in interviews around 
the time “Heaven” was released 
that the hardest person to come 
out to was himself. Before his 
coming out, Sivan sings, with 
mournful regret, “Trying to 
sedate, my mind in its cage / And 
numb what I see.”
The 
central 
concern 
in 
“Heaven” is spiritual, with Sivan 
reconciling his sexuality with 
its inherent connection to sin. 
Judaism, it seems to me, views sin 
as an act, not as a characteristic. 
One murders, for instance, but 
one is never a murderer. We’re 
all, in that way, redeemable. But 
sexuality is different because 
it’s a core part of us. It shapes 
our desires, our behaviors, our 
longings. It’s inseparable from 
who we are as people. It would 
feel 
rather 
disingenuous, 
or 
whatever the proper word for that 
is, to “atone” for my gayness and 
then, later the same day, partake 
once more in gay life.
That’s Sivan’s question: Can 
I get to heaven while being gay? 
In other words, am I abrogating 
this 
nebulous 
spiritual-cum-
religious-cum-familial obligation 
by liking men? Later, in the 
chorus, Sivan lets out a cry for 

help: “Without losing a piece of 
me / How do I get to heaven? / 
Without changing a part of me 
/ How do I get to heaven?” He 
ends his entreaty with some 
degree of resolution — “Maybe I 
don’t want heaven?” — but there’s 
more than a shred of doubt. After 
all, denying a core part of your 
identity feels rather cruel, but 
considering the alternative may 
be an eternity of damnation, well, 
something’s gotta give.
These doubts have also plagued 
my mind; I think I became more 
“religious” — or at least more 
conscious of my relationship to 
my religion — when I came out 
(again, to myself more than to 
other people). And the idea that I 
was giving into sinful temptation 
disturbed me. I didn’t have the 
throngs of screaming fans that 
comforted Sivan and told him 
he was loved, but I did have 
supportive parents and brothers 
and friends. And something tells 
me that Sivan wasn’t entirely 
comforted by that fandom, just 
as, despite displays of support, 
I still wrestled with that inner 
conversation, 
telling 
myself 
not that what I was doing was 
morally wrong in any way, but 
was disappointing to my family 
and faith, if anything by the text 
alone.
If “Heaven” asks a question, 
“My My My!” answers it. A 
passionate ode to, presumably, 
his boyfriend, the professional 
very good-looking person Jacob 
Bixenman, “My My My!” finds 
Sivan gloriously loving another 
man. The beauty, though, is that 
his act of pitching woo mirrors 
his transition from self-doubt to 
self-assurance. “Now, let’s stop 

running from love,” he croons. 
“Let’s stop running from us.” He’s 
taking a risk, as we all do when we 
fall in love. But he’s also turning 
his inner conflict from “Heaven” 
inside out. Once in denial of his 
sexuality, Sivan embraces it. And 
he’s roping others in with him.
It also helps that “My My My!” 
really bangs. Its glitch-infused 
chorus is so joyful, a mixture of 
hesitation and confidence that 
is inextricably linked to the gay 
community. It’s a community that 
has been ravaged by AIDS and 
is still held in contempt by large 
sections of America, let alone 
elsewhere in the world. Sivan’s 
vocals cut through, cheerfully 
crying, “I die every night with 
you.” Sivan has transcended 
and, perhaps, embraced this 
heaven/hell fear, describing and 
celebrating his personal petite 
mort without shame and with 
passion and verve.
When “Call Me By Your 
Name,” 
the 
other 
recent 
celebrated work of Jewish gay 
art, was released, there was some 
commentary that the film was 
a celebration of hedonism, and 
that Michael Stuhlbarg’s fatherly 
monologue towards the film’s 
conclusion was the coup de grâce 
in its celebration of uninhibited 
sexual behavior. But I don’t buy 
that. I don’t agree that someone, 
prone to intellectualizing their 
lives, finding themselves rapt by 
an unexplainable urge and an 
undeniable love is hedonistic. It’s 
liberating. It’s who he is. To deny 
our love is to deny our selves. I’m 
happy that Sivan has been able to 
do the same, and I’m glad I have 
his example to lead me through 
my own life.

CAPITOL RECORDS

was one of the first intriguing 
examples to catch my eye. A 
narrow staircase leads upstairs, 
which features a variety of 
sections 
such 
as 
mystery, 
performing arts, men’s erotica, 
health, self-help and ecology. 
Daylight streams in through 
bright, colorful curtains. For 
me, by far the most appealing 
discovery upstairs was Duke, 
a friendly dog curled up in an 
armchair.
Orr 
and 
Contreras 
have 
worked for many years to 
make Common Language a 
welcoming and useful space 
for queer people in Ann Arbor. 
Common 
Language 
was 
founded in 1991 as a space, 
alongside Aut Bar, for Ann 
Arbor’s LGBTQ+ community to 
come together and engage with 
literature.
“The primary mission of the 
bar is to provide a safe space 
for the LGBT community,” Orr 
said. “So with that in mind, 
we have always been on the 
forefront of any activism. We’ve 
sued the governor twice, won 
both times. We’ve certainly 
engaged in lots of fundraising 
activities. We’re often the focal 
point if there is any reason for 
gathering.”
As a bookstore, Common 
Language is naturally largely 
focused on literature as an art 
form. However, the store also 
features graphic and visual art 
and uses its Instagram account 
(@commonlanguage) to post 
and reblog queer art from a 
variety of sources.
“Art is a different type of 
language,” Orr said. “It’s also 
like spoken language — it’s 
going to be very different from 
one culture to another, and 

within a culture … At its heart, 
I think every piece of art is 
a piece of activism. Because 
it says something, and it says 
something in a way that’s 
different than our everyday 
experience, and therefore is 
already a radical notion. I think 
it’s one of the reasons why great 
art tends to have proponents 
who are part of a radical 
movement.”
According to Orr, the most 
prevalent 
environment 
for 

local queer art currently is 
in the realm of spoken word 
and performance art. This 
can be seen in shows such as 
“HERsay,” a performance art 
show organized by singer-
songwriter 
Patti 
Smith, 
as 
well as demonstrations such 
as performance artist Holly 
Hughes’s imaginative protest 
of Donald Trump’s presidency 

through the organization of 
performance events.
In the past, the businesses 
of Braun Court have also 
participated in stands of their 
own. One memorable incident 
occurred 
when 
notoriously 
anti-gay activist Fred Phelps 
came to picket Aut Bar in 
2001, and Orr and Contreras 
decided to respond by donating 
one dollar to the Jim Toy 
Community Center for every 
minute he stayed. They reached 
out to the community via email 
to ask for additional pledges 
and ended up raising $7,500 in 
about an hour. As such, for Orr, 
running queer businesses and 
participating in activism have 
often gone hand in hand.
“Ultimately, books are part 
of the artistic culture, and as 
such, the radical element is 
there as well,” Orr said.
And hopefully the radical 
element will be there for years 
to come. Common Language 
might be small, but it is a time-
tested and starring example of 
the type of community many 
young, queer people in Ann 
Arbor are currently envisioning 
and seeking. That is to say, a 
space that is radical while also 
being welcoming, artistic and 
relentlessly creative.
“Art’s 
what 
changes 
the 
world,” Orr said. “And such 
has it always been. Every time 
there’s a repressive regime, 
the 
underground 
movement 
is largely being fueled by, or 
working in parallel with, an 
artistic movement of some sort. 
In fact, oftentimes the artistic 
movement is well ahead of the 
political one, and the rest of the 
world is catching up. So I guess 
it’s just look, listen and learn.”

Thursday, February 15, 2018 — 3B

In 2017, singer-songwriter 

Annie Clark, better known by 
her stage name St. Vincent, 
coyly fielded questions in an 
interview with The New Yorker 
about her supposed position 
as 
the 
queer 
protagonist 

of 
her 
then-upcoming 

album 
Masseduction. 
She 

responded to the interviewer’s 
questions with, “Songs are 
like prophecies. They can be 

stronger than you are.”

Three 
years 
before 
that 

interview, 
I 
heard 
Romy 

Madley-Croft, one of the lead 
singers of the band The xx, 
croon the first few lines of 
“Shelter” from a bruised iPod 
Nano: “I find shelter in this 
way / Undercover hideaway 
/ Can you hear when I say / ‘I 
have never felt this way.’” She 
sings above sparse background 
instrumentation, 
and 
the 

yawning ambiguity of her voice 
turns the song into a seemingly 
endless 
line 
of 
possibility, 

which — at the time — matched 
the seemingly endless line of 
long black hair that belonged to 
the girl who always sat next to 
me in seventh period art class. 
She liked to paint flowers, and 
the careful way her fingers 
sketched the curving outline 
of a rose made something in 
my chest bloom. I don’t know 
what to call this kind of quiet 
attraction 
— 
easy 
laughter 

passed between us like love 
letters 
in 
an 
after-school 

special — but I did match 
the uptick of my heartbeat 
whenever she turned to talk 
to me with the tempo of the 
beat during the second half of 
“Shelter,” so I think I have a 
start.

Many years later, in an 

interview with The Fader, The 
xx would describe their music 
as “A queer space. We avoid 
gender, we avoid sexuality, we 
avoid time and place, so people 
can have that room to connect 
and to set their own ideas to it.”

Songs that can take any 

form desired; music to free the 
questioning soul.

It’s a liberation that can 

be seen time and time again 
within the musical archives. 
The androgynous legacy of 
Prince — with his blown out 

curls, 
platform 
heels 
and 

affinity for wearing sequined 
suits during performances — 
highlights the allure of art’s 
nonconformity, the lines that 
can be blurred in expressions 
of 
identity. 
“My 
name 
is 

Prince, and I am funky,” the 
opening song off of Prince’s 
historic album [Love Symbol] 
declares, embossed with the 
golden arches of The Love 
Symbol itself. The glyph Prince 
invented to take the place of 
his name during the early ’90s 
defied phonetics and defied 
labels, an icon that melded the 
astrological Mars-Venus, male-
female signs into something 
new: a bold announcement of 
fluidity.

Ziggy Stardust, the first of 

David Bowie’s many elaborate 
personas, inspired a similar 
sentiment 
of 
eccentricity. 

Stardust dazzles in Bowie’s 
1972 album, The Rise and 
Fall of Ziggy Stardust and 
the Spiders from Mars, as 
an 
extraterrestrial 
sort 
of 

hero, 
descending 
from 
the 

heavens 
with 
a 
sleek 
red 

mullet, 
heavy 
makeup 
and 

an iconic lighting bolt streak 
of red and blue, destined to 
save Earth’s slow, apocalyptic 
demise with the power of 
rock ‘n’ roll. Unfortunately, 
he eventually weaves his own 
demise. As both the spider 
and the insect caught in its 
web, he finds himself trapped 
by the destructive nature of 
the very cult of personality he 
has created. The album closes 
with the song “Rock ‘N’ Roll 
Suicide,” and Stardust, knees 
cracked under the weight of his 
own stardom, implores anyone, 
everyone, “Let’s turn on and be 
not alone (wonderful) / Gimme 
your 
hands 
cause 
you’re 

wonderful.”

More than just convoluted 

spectacle 
of 
glam 
rock, 

The Rise and Fall of Ziggy 
Stardust melded music and 
social 
commentary 
within 

the splendor of an eclectic, 
space-age narrative. It wasn’t 
queer music in the traditional 
sense — speaking directly to 
LGBTQ experiences — yet this 
particular album, as well as 
the persona it catapulted into 
prominence, is still heralded 
as an icon for many who 
question labels of sexuality, of 
gender and of the interplay of 
the two. Within the strange 
effervescence 
of 
Ziggy 

Stardust, 
the 
outcasts 
and 

misfits who questioned their 
place in society’s norms at the 
time found a hand onto which 
to grab, a space to traverse 
their own forms of creative 
expression.

A few months after her 

New Yorker interview, Clark 
dropped 
Masseduction 
and, 

much like David Bowie’s work, 
it is more illustrative of the St. 
Vincent persona she created 
than of Clark herself. The 
overtly sexual figure that graces 
the album’s cover in a leopard-
print thong and hot pink tights, 
a glaring reminder of the neon 
glow of the 1980s, is one of 
St. Vincent’s many elaborate 
manifestations. She embodies 
the rattle of pill bottles and 
throws cheeky winks that are 
half-hidden 
behind 
plastic 

surgery bandages. “Sugarboy, 

I’m in need / How I wish, for 
something sweet,” she sings on 
the album’s fourth track, and 
then immediately parries with, 
“Sugargirl, figurine / Pledge 
all your allegiance to me.” 
Songs have gleaming edges — 
sensuality oftentimes is used 
as a weapon — and the world 
she develops is one that is 
fraught with personal tension, 
different from Bowie’s and 
Prince’s softer, more grandiose 
expressions. Yet, all three pop 
phenomena can be considered 
related in the distinct ways 
they eschew orthodoxy. 

As Clark herself said in 

a series of interviews with 
Pitchfork, “All human beings 
create their own mythologies, 
and I’m in the somewhat 
bizarre 
circumstance 
of 

creating a big mythology that 
gets shared with a lot of people. 
In some ways, doing the work 
that I do is about reinventing 
a value system. More or less, 
there’s 
a 
ubiquitous 
value 

system 
in 
America, 
these 

markers that signify your rite 
of passage into adulthood or 
into validity: getting married 
and having kids and having 
mortgages. But I always felt a 
little bit like an alien cocking 

my head to the side at various 
cultural milestones, going, ‘I 
would never aspire to that.’” 

The transcendent power of 

these artists — Prince, Bowie, 
St. Vincent and countless others 
— lies in their imaginative 
exploration of the self through 
their 
music. 
The 
various 

personas 
and 
characters 

conceived may not be accurate 
representations of the artist 
but to be autobiographical is 
not the point. In the hyper-
surreal landscapes of Ziggy 
Stardust, [The Love Symbol] 
and Masseduction, individuals 
can find echoes of private 
desires that are too fluid, too 
subjective and too nuanced to 
be so easily categorized.

“When people are growing 

up they’re generally looking for 
something in the culture that 
reflects 
their 
subconscious 

yearnings,” Grayson Perry told 
The Guardian as he described 
the effect Bowie’s pop had on 
his generation in the ’70s. I 
can’t help but be reminded of 
a certain song that one bruised 
iPod Nano used to contain.

SINGLE REVIEW: “ONLY ACTING”

 Kero Kero Bonito’s new-
est single “Only Acting” 
finds the British trio exper-
imenting with elements 
of rock ‘n’ roll, punk and 
industrial music. The track 
opens simply, with a drum 
machine and vocalist Sarah 
Midori Perry delivering her 
signature light, comfort-
able flow. An easy bassline 
works its way in next — a 
definite sonic shift for Kero 
Kero Bonito — which is 
then followed by a crescen-
doing flurry of harsh synth. 
It’s exciting to see Kero 
Kero Bonito, well known 
for their stellar saccharine 
J-pop style, experimenting 
with sounds that are a little 
edgier and more intense.
 The real payoff of “Only 

Acting” is the interplay 
between Perry’s lyrics 
and the new techniques 
employed. Perry opens 
with an assertion: “When 

I step onto the stage, I 
see the curtain raise / It’s 
apparent, I’ve got someone 
to play.” The couplet is a 
tongue-in-cheek nod to how 
embodying an aesthetic can 
be useful, but also limiting. 
In Kero Kero Bonito’s case, 
Perry is making it clear that 

the past pop-centric style 
has become cumbersome, 
and that the group is ready 
to grow out of it. However, 
that isn’t to say that they 
completely abandon the 
fun, sugary electro-pop that 
put them on the map. That 
same energy is infused with 
a tense desire for release, 
culminating in skipping 
effects, errant cymbals and 
synth as the track trips 
over itself during the final 
moments. “Only Acting” is 
a morsel of what the next 
iteration of Kero Kero Boni-
to will sound like — innova-
tive, self-aware but as fun 
as ever.

“The 
original 
show 
was 

fighting for tolerance, our fight is 
for acceptance.”

This is the sentiment that 

opens the first minute of “Queer 
Eye,” a Netflix reboot of the 
2003 Bravo series “Queer Eye 
for the Straight Guy.” For those 
unfamiliar with the show, the 
concept may seem offensive or 
demeaning. Five gay men, each 
an expert in either food, culture, 
grooming, fashion or design, 
take a disheveled straight man 
and turn him into something 
beautiful. Yet the show is not an 
exploitation of stereotypes or a 
gaudy attempt at reality; rather, it 
is truly “a fight for acceptance,” as 
on-cast fashion expert Tan says.

Dallas, Ga. isn’t exactly a town 

that 
anyone 
would 
consider 

progressive. Located in the Deep 
South with a population of just 
13,000, it encapsulates the classic 
hometown Southern attitude that 
is practically immune to change. 
But this is where Bobby, Karamo, 
Tan, Antoni and Jonathan, better 
known as the “Fab 5,” find their 
first project.

Tom 
is 
a 
self-described 

“country boy.” He’s got a lush 
beard, a rotund belly and a thick 
Southern drawl — the type of 
character who would seem more 
comfortable adorning a certain 
red trucker hat than a pair of 
suede Oxford shoes picked out 
for him by a gay man. When the 

Fab 5 find him, Tom is sitting in 
a stained recliner, drinking his 
special mix of Mountain Dew 
and tequila. He may look like a 
lost cause, and with his mantra of 
“You can’t fix ugly,” it’s clear that 
he certainly thinks he is.

Yet the last thing that “Queer 

Eye” will stand for is insecurity. 
This is a show about acceptance, 
and that means accepting every 

part of yourself and expecting 
others to do the same. The Fab 5 
are unapologetically themselves, 
and they each have a vibrant 
personality that transcends the 
career stereotypes that people 
may try to fit them into. The same 
goes for Tom, who I myself am 
guilty of placing into a certain 
category. But Tom is a delightful 
character whose transformation 
from a jort-clad lonely man to 
a confident, flat-cap wearing 
grandpa 
was 
honestly 
tear-

inducing.

And 
it’s 
through 
this 

realization 
and 
through 
the 

interaction between the men 
that the significance of the show 
becomes so evident. The politics 
are not obvious, but they are 
certainly present. Nobody has 
to ask what might be strange 
about bringing together these 
two demographics that are so 
often pitted against each other. 
But watching Tom cuddle up on 
a mattress with Jonathan and 

Bobby, talk love with Antoni and 
be vulnerable with Karamo — it 
makes a person start to question 
everything they thought they 
knew about how we should view 
and treat each other.

Normalizing this behavior is 

why it is so important that we 
have such queer representation 
on television. This decade is no 
stranger to a proliferation of queer 
characters on hit TV shows. From 
“Modern Family” to “Andi Mack” 
to “Will & Grace,” queer people 
are representing all different 
walks of life. And while all of that 
is wonderful, “Queer Eye” brings 
a new, perhaps more favored form 
of representation. In “Queer Eye,” 
queerness is obviously central, 
but it isn’t a plotline or conflict 
or ploy to get publicity. Rather, it 
is just something that permeates 
every aspect of the show, in all 
of its pure-fun glory. If you’re 
watching “Queer Eye,” you are 
going to be having a good time. 
Incorporating 
queerness 
into 

such a feel-good, relatable show 
not only encourages, but also 
fosters, acceptance.

As humans, our differences 

may seem far more important 
than our commonalities. It is 
hard to look at someone who 
leads such a vastly different 
lifestyle and believe that they too 
share the same hopes and wants 
and insecurities as you do. But if 
“Queer Eye” teaches us anything, 
it is that some prejudices and 
assumptions run only skin-deep 
and no matter the circumstances, 
there is nothing that a great 
makeover can’t fix.

Exploring the evolution of 
contemporary gay cinema

The shape and fabric of 
queer 
cinema, 
particularly 
male-centered gay narratives, 
has 
changed 
and 
evolved 
in 
interesting 
ways 
in 
contemporary 
film 
history. 
Some of the most beautiful, 
heartbreaking and emotionally 
resonant stories of the past two 
decades involve a negotiation 
of love and desire between 
two men. Critically acclaimed 
films 
featuring 
these 
narratives, 
like 
“Brokeback 
Mountain,” “Moonlight” and 
“Call Me by Your Name,” 
portray the dynamics of gay 
relationships in different ways 
reflective of the contemporary 
social 
landscape. 
These 
three films, notable for their 
critical 
success 
and 
wide 
popular appeal, showcase an 
important evolution in the 
artistic 
representation 
of 
gay narratives as well as the 
cultural reception of these 
stories.
In 
2005, 
“Brokeback 
Mountain” made waves as one 
of the first films in wide release 
to show open expressions of 
affection and desire between 
male characters. The film tells 
the story of two cowboys, Ennis 
Del Mar (Heath Ledger, “The 
Dark Knight”) and Jack Twist 
(Jake Gyllenhaal, “Stronger”), 
whose passionate escapades 
in 
the 
isolated 
Wyoming 
countryside turn into a lifelong 
forbidden love. Ennis and Jack 
both represent a brand of 
dominant masculinity defined 
by 
gruff 
silences, 
salt-of-
the-earth physical labor and 
bow-legged stances typical of 
the unromanticized modern 
cowboy. But alone in the scrub 
of Brokeback Mountain, the 
two men are free to release the 
façade and explore each other 
emotionally and physically.
The 
texture 
of 
the 
relationship 
between 
Ennis 
and 
Jack 
in 
“Brokeback 
Mountain” 
is 
shaped 
by 
tense silence. The two men 
engage in intimacy through 
aggressive 
and 
hurried 
moments of furious passion, 
communicating in a few quick 
thrusts the conflicting tension 
between desire, guilt, identity 

and 
societal 
condemnation 
intertwined in the act of love. 
Silence is almost a tangible 
and weighted physical force 
in this film, present and solid 
as Ennis and Jack try to come 
to terms with their internal 
desires. Through this silence, 
the irreversible bond forged 
between the two is clear from 
body language and eye contact 
alone. Eventually, both men 
must return to civilization 
and try to lead normal lives, 
marrying women and having 
children. 
The 
sweeping 
tragedy of the film is the 
collection of speckled moments 
where Ennis and Jack share a 
brief rendezvous on Brokeback 

Mountain, dream of a life 
together and know it would be 
impossible.
“Brokeback 
Mountain” 
is a story of powerful but 
heartbreaking 
forbidden 
love. 
The 
film 
represents 
a gay narrative defined by 
sparse, 
intense 
physicality 
and chronic longing, with men 
who fit neatly into the mold 
of dominant masculinity. The 
film reflects a budding societal 
acceptance 
of 
mainstream 
queer narratives, an ability 
to watch two men having sex 
on screen and appreciate the 
humanness 
of 
their 
story. 
But the film’s overwhelming 
focus on the consequences 
of being gay also reflects a 
persistent 
societal 
fear 
of 
wholly accepting gay romance 
as simply romance in general. 
The film is an important 
benchmark in gay cinematic 
narratives, particularly male-
centered ones, but fails to 
do the work of more recent 
critically acclaimed films.
In 
2016, 
Barry 
Jenkins 
popped onto the scene with 

“Moonlight,” 
a 
hauntingly 
beautiful film chronicling the 
youth, adolescence and young 
adulthood of Chiron, a kid 
growing up gay and Black in 
Miami, played in three parts 
by Alex Hibbert (“The Chi”), 
Ashton 
Sanders 
(“Straight 
Outta Compton”) and Trevante 
Rhodes (“If Loving You Is 
Wrong”). The film handles 
its gay coming-of-age story 
with 
impeccable 
nuance 
and grace, painting a main 
character whose personality is 
opaque but whose desires for 
companionship are viscerally 
resonant. Chiron’s relationship 
with 
Kevin, 
also 
played 
in 
three 
parts 
(newcomer 
Jaden Piner), Jharrel Jerome 
(“Mr. Mercedes”) and André 
Holland (“Selma”) acts as a 
throughline in the film, as 
Kevin is Chiron’s first and only 
sexual encounter.
“Moonlight” 
is 
deeply 
moving 
in 
its 
almost 
symphonic gay narrative. Like 
“Brokeback 
Mountain,” 
the 
film has little dialogue; Chiron 
is defined by his quietness, 
barely 
speaking 
to 
other 
characters or voicing his own 
thoughts and emotions. It is 
only with Kevin that Chiron is 
able to articulate his thoughts 
and feelings, and in every stage 
of the movie, Kevin’s genuine 
interest in Chiron allows him 
to shake off the weight of 
his crippling loneliness. The 
relationship between Chiron 
and Kevin is complicated by 
the rules and expectations of 
their world, as in “Brokeback,” 
but the simplicity of their 
connectedness to each other 
is 
profoundly 
beautiful. 
Masculinity 
also 
plays 
a 
similar role in “Moonlight” 
like it did in “Brokeback.” 
Dominant 
masculinity 
is 
reaffirmed, as Chiron tries 
to emulate the hard exterior 
of powerful men as armor 
for his inner tenderness. The 
film doesn’t reject this form 
of masculinity, but challenges 
its 
validity 
and 
explores 
the complex negotiations of 
identity.
Unlike 
“Brokeback 
Mountain,” the gay narrative 
in “Moonlight” is textured 
by a gentle give-and-take of 
honesty 
and 
vulnerability. 
The 
film’s 
incredible 
win 

for Best Picture at the 2017 
Oscars 
reflects 
a 
societal 
appreciation 
for 
intricate, 
introspective 
stories 
that 
reveal the realities of human 
experience. In “Moonlight,” 
the gay narrative is both the 
focus of the film and one of its 
many layers. The film marks 
the progression from a crucial 
and critical focus on sexuality 
to a dynamic and nuanced 
portrayal of a character who 
happens to be gay.
The most recent film to 
feature desire between two 
male characters is “Call Me by 
Your Name,” a breathtaking 
story of attraction and affection 
between 
Elio 
(Timothée 
Chalamet, “Lady Bird”) and 
Oliver (Armie Hammer, “Free 
Fire”). The tension between 
Elio and Oliver builds as a 
gradual avalanche, collecting 
itself slowly and ultimately 
barreling all at once. But 
unlike the hurried bouts of 
furious passion between Ennis 
and Jack in “Brokeback,” Elio 
and Oliver explore each other 
gently, slowly and tenderly. 
And while physicality plays 
a part in “Call Me by Your 
Name,” as in its predecessor, 
it takes the form of a gentle, 
pawing playfulness, similar to 
“Moonlight.”
The shading of the gay 
narrative in “Call Me by Your 
Name” 
is 
unprecedented 
in the canon of critically 
acclaimed films of its kind. 
The film doesn’t focus on 
characters 
wrestling 
with 
their sexuality and is simply 
about love and personhood 
and bodies. Masculinity is 
not emphasized, questioned 
or asserted, but is almost 

dismissed in favor of passion. 
The 
film 
is 
unconcerned 
with structuring a space in 
which two people can’t be 
together, and instead explores 

the 
equally 
heartbreaking 
forces of memory and feeling. 
“Call Me by Your Name” is 
a universal story about a 
human connection between 
two people who wholly love 
each other. The success of the 
film, its enormous presence 
in popular culture and the 
way fans worship and obsess 
over Chalamet and Hammer 
all speak to a societal shift in 
audiences who crave a story 

about an organic and beautiful 
love 
between 
two 
people. 
“Call Me by Your Name” isn’t a 
story about a gay relationship, 
but about a relationship in 
general, one that emphasizes 
the 
importance 
of 
feeling 
deeply.
Vulnerability is the guiding 
throughline of these three 
films. 
In 
each, 
characters 
must 
detach 
themselves 
from 
societal 
expectations 
and personal hesitations and 
relinquish themselves to the 
purity of love and desire. 
While each film handles this 
process in different ways, they 
collectively show how gay 
narratives are defined by the 
process of opening oneself up 
emotionally in order to share 
a selfless, tender and deep 
emotional 
connection 
with 
someone else. In “Brokeback 
Mountain,” 
vulnerability 
reveals the fragile masculinity 
of its characters who are 
trapped 
by 
an 
era 
that 
condemns 
their 
expression 
of 
love. 
In 
“Moonlight,” 
vulnerability is both Chiron’s 
weakest and strongest point; he 
struggles against it his whole 
life, but when he relinquishes 
himself to it, he finally finds 
peace 
and 
happiness. 
In 
“Call Me by Your Name,” 
vulnerability 
is 
celebrated, 
as the characters physically 
and emotionally explore each 
other in honest terms and 
celebrate the experience of 
feeling. The lasting presence 
and evolution of vulnerability 
in gay narratives emphasize 
the shifting ways in which 
audiences 
and 
filmmakers 
understand and portray the 
nuances of queer experiences.

Joshua Bell is met with 
endless praise in encore

There’s nothing quite like 
hearing one of the world’s top 
musicians performing in one 
of their favorite concert halls. 
Joshua 
Bell’s 
performance 
with 
Sam 
Haywood 
this 
past weekend in the Hill 
Auditorium was one of these 

instances.
From the very moment that 
I 
entered 
the 
auditorium, 
the concert hall was abuzz. 
Practically every seat in the 
hall was full, thousands of 
excited conversations being 
conducted 
throughout 
the 
auditorium.
After 
the 
thunderous 
applause as Bell entered the 
stage, the quiet opening of 
Mozart’s “Violin Sonata No. 
32 in B-Flat Major” seemed 
quite modest and unassuming. 
Bell and Haywood’s playing 
was impeccable, each phrase 
flowing seamlessly into the 
next. If anything, I found 
it difficult at certain points 
to remain engaged with the 
performers on stage — the 
music was so calming that 
it became hard to remember 
that it was being performed 
by the two little people being 
dwarfed by the huge stage 
on which they stood. This 
flawless performance was met 
with three separate applauses, 
the audience refusing to hold 
their praise until the end of the 

work.
Though the concert was 
presumably centered around 
Joshua Bell, Sam Haywood 
easily lived up to expectation. 
He played with an incredible 
attention to detail, bringing 
specific notes out of the texture 
and offering an interesting 
counterpart to Bell’s playing. 
Haywood’s 
loose 
definition 
of tempo gave the pieces an 
ethereal quality as he felt out 
each moment, accelerating and 
decelerating in tandem.
The second piece on the 
program was Richard Strauss’s 
“Violin Sonata in E-Flat Major.” 
This thorny work was executed 
with 
the 
same 
technical 
proficiency as the first piece. 
The frantic arpeggios in the 
piano and scalar passages in 
the violin were particularly 
impressive. At no point in the 
piece did it seem as though 
Bell 
was 
in 
anything 
but 
complete control. He moved 
around 
the 
stage, 
leaning 
backwards as he reached for 
higher 
notes 
and 
jumping 
forward 
as 
he 
navigated 
particularly loud or assertive 
passages. It was incredibly fun 
to watch these two musicians 
communicate 
through 
the 
music, the separation between 
the audience and performers 
dissolving 
as 
the 
musical 
conversation continued.
The 
piece 
ends 
with 
a 
prolonged false cadence before 
a quick, humorous coda. Bell 
sold this ending both visually 
and aurally, the beleaguered 
false ending matching Bell’s 
increasingly 
rigid 
playing 
posture. Bell jumped in the 
air as the quick coda passage 
began 
and 
the 
musicians 
followed 
through 
with 
an 
energetic performance of this 
passage. After two applauses, 
Bell and Haywood retired to 
the dressing rooms to take 
their well deserved break.
Third 
on 
the 
program 
was Schubert’s “Fantasie for 
Violin and Piano in C Major.” 
Bell and Haywood managed 
the eclectic work well. The 
calm opening gave no hint of 
the lively concepts to come, 
the 
violin 
part 
constantly 
reaching 
its 
upper 
limits 
before 
somehow 
expanding 
even further upward. For the 
first time in the concert, Bell 

had some pizzicato (plucked) 
passages. If there was anything 
missing from this performance 
it was his employment of this 
technique, as it was quite 
difficult to hear Bell over the 
piano. The rest of the work, 
however, was quite impressive 
— though the work calls for 
the upper limits of the violin’s 
large range, Bell did not seem 
phased.
The applause following this 
work was overpowering. After 
two encores, Bell announced 
from the stage that he would 
perform a movement from 
Clara 
Schumann’s 
“Three 
Romances” 
and 
Henri 
Wieniaski’s “Polonaise No. 1 in 
D Major.” The Schumann was 
a touching end to the concert, 
a quick respite before the 
virtuosic “Polonaise.” In this 
regard, the “Polonaise” did 
not disappoint. Bell performed 
the 
piece 
from 
memory, 
moving about the entire stage 
as he was finally freed from 
the spatial limitations of the 
stand. It was this piece, more 

than anything, that stuck with 
me after I left the concert — 
Bell moving about the stage, 
his hands a blur, his bow in 
motion; the complex passages 
meeting the ears seeming to 
defy the simplicity with which 
the musician carried himself. 
It was a memorable end to a 
memorable concert, a musical 
experience that will stick with 
me for a long time.

FILM NOTEBOOK


The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Thursday, February 15, 2018 — 5B

“My dad and I both grew up in 
the same Pennsylvania town. And 
he was gay, and I was gay and he 
killed himself.”
This is the line that sums up 
the plot of the critically acclaimed 
graphic memoir and musical 
“Fun Home,” a riveting story 
based on the life of cartoonist 
Alison Bechdel.
I first read Alison Bechdel’s 
2006 
graphic 
memoir 
“Fun 
Home” 
when 
its 
musical 
adaptation was nominated for 
Best Musical at the 2015 Tony 
Awards. 
Discovering 
“Fun 
Home” was one of the most 
interesting and intimate reading 
experiences I’ve ever had. It is a 
heartbreaking and truthful and 
beautiful depiction of a unique 
experience that has the ability to 
transcend its specific narrative, 
making it relatable in a way I 
would never have expected. 
Although I don’t identify as a 
part of the LGBTQ+ community, 
I never expected a graphic novel 
about the experience of growing 
up with a queer identity to speak 
to me on such a personal level. 
But just as the queer community 
is constantly asked to suspend 
their own disbelief to relate to the 
hundreds of thousands of straight 
protagonists in all mainstream 
literature, it shouldn’t come as a 
shock that as a straight person, I 
could relate deeply to the queer 
narrative Bechdel shares with us 
through her cartoons.
When the book was published 
in 2006, “Fun Home” headlined 
nearly every best of the year 
book list, but it took a transition 
into a musical and garnering 
an immediate popularity in the 
world of musical theatre to find its 
way to my bookshelf. Praised for 
breaking the boundaries of any 

definition the world previously 
held of “memoir,” the story 
follows Bechdel’s childhood in 
rural Pennsylvania and tells the 
journey of both her own sexuality 
and her relationship with her 
closeted gay father. The memoir 
is laid out in a series of comics that 
chronicles her relationships with 
her parents and grapples with the 
past and the present — telling the 
stories of her life before and after 
her father’s suicide.
The graphic novel is seen as 
a turning point for the world of 
graphic novels — after its massive 
success, more people began to 
write and share graphic novels. 
But more importantly, after its 
publication, the greater theme 
of 
queerness 
became 
more 
mainstream in the world of art 
and literature. The story came at 
a time where the world was ready 
to celebrate this narrative and 
bring it into a dialogue that had 
been on the precipice for a very 
long time. The honesty of the 
novel makes reading it feel like 
looking directly into the house 
that Bechdel grew up in, the one 
described intricate in the memoir.
After being received as a smash 
hit in both the queer community 
and society as a whole, talk of 
a musical based on the memoir 
began in 2013. “Fun Home” 
opened on Broadway officially in 
2015, and the theatre community 
— 
more 
importantly, 
the 
mainstream theatre world that 
is Broadway — have never been 
given such a gift.
Historically, 
musicals 
and 
plays that make it to Broadway 
aren’t always the ones that look 
to make a statement, but rather 
those that look to entertain. 
“Fun Home” was able to do 
both, creating a beautiful and 
captivating 
moment 
for 
the 
world. After falling in love with 
the novel, I bought tickets to the 
show when it took home the 2015 

Tony for Best Musical, among 
other accolades. The LGBTQ+ 
narrative needed to hit center 
stage Broadway; I sat in the Circle 
in the Square Theatre in early 
2016 and I don’t think I breathed 
for a full two hours. By the end, I 
was sobbing with a joint feeling 
of heartache and awe. The most 
beautiful and inspiring part of the 
performance was seeing a queer 
protagonist not limited to just a 
coming-out-narrative. The story 
is about so much more: memory, 
relationships, connecting with 
others, 
growing 
up, 
finding 
yourself and coming to terms with 
the life that you have been given. 
All of this is surrounded by and 
framed in Bechdel’s struggle with 
her sexuality — both the graphic 
novel and the musical are unique 
in that they are multifaceted. I sat 
in that theatre, right in the center 
of Bechdel’s pain and ecstasy and 
was refreshed to see something 
so needed on a mainstream stage, 
being shared and celebrated 
by the queer and non-queer 
communities alike.
Since its original publication, 
“Fun Home” has become a 
cultural phenomenon. It is the 
gift that the world needed, it is the 
musical Broadway needed and it 
is the book my mind and heart and 
soul needed. Despite closing on 
Broadway in 2016, the show has 
completed its first national tour, 
produced regionally in the United 
States as well as internationally 
in the Philippines, with its 
future sights set on Japan and a 
second national tour. Its ability to 
continue to captivate and affect 
audiences is a great testament to 
the universality and prominence 
of the story. It is a beautiful 
moment for the queer community 
and the world — one that inspires 
thoughtful discussions and opens 
the door to more mainstream art 
that is rooted deeply in the theme 
of queer identity.

“What kind of music do you 
like?”
When 
this 
question 
is 
dropped on any date/Tinder 
conversation I’ve ever had, my 
heart hits my stomach. There’s 
the safe route containing my 
pop interests: “I adore Carly 
Rae Jepsen and Lorde. The new 
Charli XCX mixtape is full of 
jams. I’ve been a long time 1D 
fan,” etc. And then there’s the 
answer that’s a bit more true to 
form: “I’d literally cut my heart 
out for The Wonder Years. I 
feel a religious connection 
to everything Green Day has 

ever done. I shed a few tears 
during Jawbreaker’s reunion 
set at Riot Fest last year.” As a 
gay man in 2018, I often find it 
hard to reconcile my punk and 
queer 
identities, 
something 
that has bothered me due to 
the closely entwined history of 
these two cultures.
Both 
punk 
and 
queer 
identities share the idea of 
“otherness” — not making 
the cut for normalcy, feeling 
disenfranchised from the state 
of the world and generally 
sticking out. The punk scene 
was 
often 
where 
queer-
identifying people would be 
able to gather to have some 
sense of belonging. Punk is 
literally rooted in otherness, 
in the ability “to stick it to the 
man” and to live however you 
want, not how the world wants 
you to. The first time I heard 
the lyric “So fuck the world 
/ And what it wants me to 
be,” off of “Hoodie Weather” 
by The Wonder Years, was 
the first time I began to have 
hope for any type of agency in 
my life. It was the first time I 
decided to fight back against 
the 
homophobia 
deeply 
ingrained in me from 13 years 
spent in Catholic school.
About a year ago, I read 
an article by Tom Vellner on 
Noisey that lauded the merits 
of punk and “the scene” in 
helping him come out as a gay 
man after also spending years 
in Catholic school. The article 
mirrored my experiences in 
middle school and high school 
with almost startling accuracy. 
I have vivid memories of being 
enthralled by the melodrama of 
My Chemical Romance’s “I’m 
Not OK (I Promise),” and the 

sensual theatricality of Panic! 
At The Disco’s Brendon Urie 
helped me understand that it 
was just fine to be male and 
expressive at the same time. 
Senses Fail’s Pull The Thorns 
from Your Heart taught me 
that a period of self-hatred 
and 
denial 
was 
perfectly 
normal for queer people to 
go 
through, 
and 
hearing 
Billie Joe Armstrong belt out 
“Seventeen and strung out 
on confusion” from “Coming 
Clean” comforted me more 
than anything else when I was 
17 myself. My first real crush 
ever was probably on Pete 
Wentz of Fall Out Boy. This 
music was my first indication 
that I wasn’t an anomaly.
As 
positive 
and 
heartwarming as the article 
was for me, I also find it 
to 
be 
a 
fairly 
uncommon 
experience 
in 
the 
modern 
world and among people my 
age. While I certainly know 
other queer punks, I’m more 
often greeted with surprise 
or a jabbing, “I used to love 
‘Sugar 
We’re 
Goin 
Down’ 
when I was 15” when I tell 
other gays (usually men) about 
my musical passions. Despite 
the shared ethos of punk/emo 
music and queerness, there 
seems to be a disconnect in 
the 
general 
perception 
of 
their relationship by many gay 
individuals in the 21st century.
This could be largely due 
to the mostly indie/hip hop 
obsessed bubble of Ann Arbor 
(the city where I first opened 
up to seeing men romantically), 
but I’d like to propose that it 
could be partly in response to 
the more open social climate 
of today’s world in comparison 
to the ’80s and ’90s. With the 
continuous 
deconstruction 
of social norms like gender 
and 
heteronormativity 
— 
which punk culture was one 
of the first to widely express 
and popularize (i.e. Pansy 
Division) 
in 
the 
last 
few 
decades of the 20th century 
— LGBTQ+ individuals may 
find it less necessary to seek 
comfort 
in 
marginalized, 
niche cultures that used to 
represent safe havens for the 
queer community. More queer 
people might be able to find 
comfort in shinier, more visible 
mainstream genres like pop 
and hop hop, or simply not feel 
the need for catharsis in music. 
While 
these 
are 
freedoms 
I wish I had growing up, 
brainwashed by conservatism 
and religion — I often had 
to sneak my sisters’ Britney 
Spears HitClips because boys 
weren’t supposed to enjoy 
“(You Drive Me) Crazy” — it’s 
a beautiful thing to witness 
an improving social climate 
where more and more LGBTQ+ 
people feel much less pressure 
from society.
Yet, I’m also worried that 
the sparks ignited by the punk 
movement that have burned 
a path for this improvement 
are slowly being forgotten and 
degraded. 
The 
importance 
of 
this 
artform 
in 
queer 
identity 
is 
being 
further 
marginalized even by queer 
people themselves, chalking 
it up to meritless melodrama 

masked in aggressive guitar 
riffs and the quick pulse of 
a snare drum. Punk culture 
continues to degrade itself in 
the modern world through 

the perpetuation and almost 
overwhelming 
saturation 
of assault cases, most often 
by cis, straight white men. 
Despite 
today’s 
decaying 
relationship 
between 
queer 
and punk cultures, it should be 
remembered as a forerunner 
and advocator for queer rights 
and expression, as a place for 
those growing up without 
acceptance to go and finally 
turn themselves inside out.
Punk music let me know 
it was OK to ride my sisters’ 
Barbie bike and to play Pretty, 
Pretty Princess with them and 
to love “The Powerpuff Girls” 
and, eventually, to look at a 
cute boy without a second of 
shame.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW: ‘SISTER CITIES’

 Just a few weeks ago, The 
Wonder Years put up a mys-
terious website with a list of 
coordinates; these coordi-
nates happened to be the loca-
tion of posters spread across 
the globe — from Manhattan 
to Dublin to Sydney and many 
other places — each contain-
ing a letter spelling out a 
password to unlock a teaser 
video for their forthcoming 
album Sister Cities. In the 
video, lead singer Dan Camp-
bell offers a succinct thesis 
for their latest work: “It’s 
a record about distance, or 
maybe how little the distance 
matters anymore.”
 Last week, the band 
released the title track as the 
album’s lead single along with 
a music video directed by Josh 
Coll (formerly of Foxing). The 
song explores this idea of dis-
tance and the interconnectiv-
ity of the human experience. 
Both in composition and lyri-
cism, The Wonder Years con-
tinue to separate themselves 
from other contemporary rock 
bands, relaying emotionality 
that feels intimate to the lis-
tener but is also immediately 
understood to be universal. 
Campbell belts out on the 

bridge, “I was just mange and 
skin and bone / You took me 
into your home / Kept warm 
on a blanket from your worn 
out winter coat,” leaving us 
with a hint of the comfort 
we experience in the people 
around us; reminding us that 
negativity and collapse aren’t 
permanent.
 The video chronicles the 
experiences of people staying 
at the same motel, mapping 
out different emotions in 
their separate lives and fol-
lowing the maid who cleans 
up the aftermath — there’s 
destructive children, lovers 
in the bathtub, a duo dancing 
in a haze, a couple in a bitter 
argument and a family trying 
to cope with their displace-
ment by a 
hurricane. 
Throughout 
the video, 
shots cut 
from delight 
and ecstasy 
to grief and 
anger, a 
breathless 
whirlwind 
of emotions 
as frantic as the track itself. 
Uniting these scenes in the 

common setting of the motel 
unites these emotions and 
experiences 
within all of 
us, conveying 
the cohesive 
essence of 
human nature.
 Toward the 
end of their 
teaser, Camp-
bell adds that 
the record is 
“about how we 
all experience grief and suc-
cesses in these alternating 

tidal waves of joy and devas-
tation,” a perfect summary 
for the theme of their latest 
music video. If the lead single 
is any indication, The Wonder 
Years’s masterful storytell-
ing is taken to new horizons 
and even greater heights on 
Sister Cities, one with a scope 
far vaster than the more per-
sonally oriented narratives 
explored on their past few 
records.

Alex & Effee expand narratives 
of LGBTQ+ in blog, love and life

To be trans and visible has 
always been radical. Despite 
the leaps and bounds made by 
activists like Laverne Cox and 
Janet Mock (their work being 
proclaimed in 2014 as “The 
Transgender Tipping Point” by 
Time), transgender individuals 
continue to be the victims of 
violence 
disproportionately. 
And while more and more 
transgender stories are being 
brought to television and film, 
stock characters and ideas, such 
as the “tragic trans figure” or 
the 
“successful 
transition,” 
dominate the public’s idea of 
trans life.
It 
makes 
sense, 
then, 
that the next step for trans 
representation 
in 
media 
is 
finding a voice for the stories 
that defy tragedy or explore 
life beyond, or even without, 
transition. Artists Alex Jenny 
and Effee Nelly are a pair of 
queer and trans people of color 
who seek an outlet for these 
stories. Jenny and Nelly are 
poets and photographers, who 
recently opened a blog that 
chronicles their experiences in 
life and love.
Jenny and Nelly met at the 
University in 2012 and graduated 
in 2014. The pair married later 
that year. While they were not 
as much the activists they are 
now, Jenny was a member of 
The Coalition for Queer People 
of Color and volunteered at the 
Sexual Assault Prevention and 
Awareness Center. Last Friday, 
SAPAC invited Jenny and Nelly 
to speak on the intersection of 
queer and trans identities and 
healthy relationships.
“They invited me back a few 
years ago to do the keynote 

for 
their 
student 
activist 
conference, and once we started 
the blog, they invited both of us 
back,” Jenny said.
Their blog was born out of 
their need to feel connected 
to the creative aspects of their 
lives as the pair was busy 
maintaining and building their 
professional lives. By day, Jenny 
is a therapist and social worker 
and Nelly works as a consultant. 
But out of the 
office, they are 
poets and artists. 
The blog, simply 
titled 
“Alex 
& 
Effee,” 
consists 
of 
writing, 
photography and 
a journal where 
they share life 
updates 
and 
playlists. 
The 
pair’s 
writing 
deals with the 
complete 
trans 
experience, 
ranging 
from 
healing, current 
and past trauma, 
romance 
and 
family.
Despite meeting in 2012, 
the pair didn’t bring their 
relationship to social media 
until Feb. 2017. Part of the 
delay 
stemmed 
from 
their 
growing disconnect from the 
creative part of their lives as 
the pair worked on building and 
maintaining their professional 
lives. Other reasons are far 
more personal.
“We didn’t identify as trans 
when we were here at school, 
but through the safety of our 
relationship, 
we 
developed 
together and discovered parts 
of ourselves we thought were 
unlovable,” Jenny said.
Through their process of 
growth and healing, Jenny 

and Nelly bring a different sort 
of queer and trans narrative 
to the fore. Instead of telling 
a 
traditional 
coming-out 
narrative, 
like 
Amazon’s 
“Transparent,” or a tragedy 
like “Prayers for Bobby” or 
“Brokeback Mountain,” Jenny 
and Nelly use their blog to 
share what Jenny calls: “the 
multiplicity 
of 
possibilities 
and existence. There are so 
many 
different 
storylines 
for 
queer and trans 
people, not this 
one 
imagined 
narrative.”
However, 
opening up for 
the entire world 
was not an easy 
process. 
The 
pair 
worked 
on 
striking 
a 
delicate balance 
between 
raw 
and 
confident, 
a struggle that 
continues to play 
out 
for 
many 
queer and trans 
individuals. 
Nelly said that “as trans people, 
we’re often reminiscing,” which 
alludes to the push-and-pull 
between internal pressures to 
be true to oneself and external 
pressures to follow the status 
quo. So, if a person comes out 
later in life, they question 
whether their efforts to protect 
themselves when they were 
younger 
inhibited 
potential 
growth. This question resonates 
throughout many of Jenny and 
Nelly’s poems.
While it has been a struggle 
inviting so many people into 
their creative process, Jenny 
and Nelly find managing the 
blog to be incredibly fulfilling. 
As time has passed, Nelly said, 

“(they’re) being a lot more 
intentional now” and explained 
how the couple is trying to 
give readers and followers a 
full picture of her and Jenny’s 
love. She mentions how some of 
the photography on their blog 
helped a father find someone to 
do senior pictures for his trans 
daughter, which was incredibly 
fulfilling. “These are gifts to my 
younger self that she just didn’t 
have,” she said.
Aside from new creative 
pathways, Jenny and Nelly 
find the blog to be a different 
and exciting new outlet for 
activism. For Nelly, starting 
conversations 
through 
an 
online platform — and being 
visible in that way — is very 
different.
“I was in direct action. I was 
part of the group advocating for 
a new Trotter,” Nelly said.
Jenny agreed and stated that 
the blog allows them to explore 
elements of their identity that 
other forms of activism cannot: 
“I don’t think we would have 
been able to do this a few years 
ago. Our most radical work is to 
love ourselves.”
Romance 
or 
not, 
Jenny 
and Nelly’s blog reflects the 
crescendoing calls for a new 
sense of social rights and a 
complete picture of the life of 
marginalized individuals.
“As glamorous as we portray 
ourselves, we are part of that 
middle,” Nelly said.
As you read through Jenny 
and Nelly’s blog, you start to 
understand the inner workings 
of their lives. They like pop 
music. They reminisce about 
the past. They love to see their 
family and travel. From their 
journal, you would think that 
life is simple and easy now — 
but the road to being visible has 
been everything but.

It’s no secret that historically 
mainstream 
hip-hop 
culture 
has been saturated by straight 
men making misogynistic and 
homophobic remarks in their 
music and in the media. Hip 
hop was dubbed a male and 
masculine genre that had no 
room for women or those with 
a queer identity. However, time 
changes things, as does talent.
Queer hip hop got its start as 
an underground movement in the 
early ’90s. Labeled “homo hop,” 
the movement wasn’t aiming to 
create a subgenre of music but to 
serve as a community building 
tool 
for 
LGBTQ+ 
rappers. 
Primarily 
based in Calif., 
the 
movement 
included 
the 
likes 
of 
rap 
group 
Deep 
Dickollective 
and 
rappers 
Caushun 
and 
Cazwell. Yet, the 
idea of a queer-
identifying 
famous 
rapper 
still 
seemed 
strange. 
An 
unspoken 
rule 
still permeated 
hip 
hop, 
that 
even if you were 
queer, you didn’t 
talk about it.
While 
not 
necessarily 
a 
rapper, 
Frank 
Ocean is still a 
part of hip hop’s 
culture. He was 
a 
member 
of 
the 
California-
based rap collective Odd Future 
and is friends with legendary 
hip-hop artists like André 3000, 
Jay-Z and Kanye West. On July 
4, 2012, Ocean posted an open 
letter on his Tumblr account 
in which he stated that the first 
person he ever fell in love with 
was a man. His next album, 
released a week after his Tumblr 
post, 
would 
be 
filled 
with 
beautiful lyrics referencing his 
first love. Channel Orange went 
on to sell 131,000 copies in its 
first week, debuting at number 
two on the Billboard Top 200. A 
queer identifying man became a 
reserved superstar.
Ocean’s 
success 
set 
a 
precedent. 
Queer 
hip-hop 
artists who may have felt they 
couldn’t express their sexual 
identities through their music 
now had a shining example to 
look up to. Tyler, the Creator, 
the Odd Future frontman with 
an eccentric personality and a 
brand defined by his comical 
approach to music and social 
media, took a different approach 
to 
his 
most 
recent 
album, 
Flower Boy. Seen as a “coming 
out” album by critics and fans 
alike, the candid Flower Boy is 

splattered with direct references 
to Tyler’s sexuality. In the track 
“I Ain’t Got Time,” Tyler raps — 
almost under his breath — “Next 
line, I’ll have em’ like woah / I’ve 
been kissing white boys since 
2004.”
While Tyler, The Creator is a 
part of the culture Frank Ocean 
helped popularize, artists like 
Kevin Abstract are a result of 
it. His 2016 album American 
Boyfriend: A Suburban Love 
Story paints a vivid picture of 
two men completely taken with 
one another. Abstract doesn’t 
try to hide his identity with 
suggestive 
or 
impressionistic 
lyrics. He is direct and open 
about his feelings for the man 
he loves. On the second verse of 
the album’s title track Abstract 
sings, “My parents 
wanna kill them 
/ Let them kill 
me.” 
An 
aura 
of 
indifference 
towards 
others’ 
opinions 
of 
his 
sexual 
identity 
permeates 
throughout 
American 
Boyfriend.
Hip 
hop’s 
attitude towards 
queerness 
is 
evolving 
rapidly. 
The 
culture 
is 
beginning 
to 
lose 
the 
toxic 
masculinity 
that plagued the 
early years of the 
genre’s 
history. 
Atlanta-based 
rapper 
Young 
Thug wore a dress 
for the cover of 
his 2016 mixtape 
Jeffrey, and when 
asked about his decision to do 
so, he stated: “When it comes 
to swag, there is no gender 
involved.” Jay-Z raps about his 
mother coming out in “Smile” — 
“Cried tears of joy when you fell 
in love / Don’t matter to me if it’s a 
him or her.” Old- and new-school 
rappers alike are beginning to 
embrace the cultural shift of 
popular rap.
Despite 
the 
strides 
that 
have been made, it would be 
misleading to say that hip hop 
has become a safe space for the 
LGBTQ+ community. A few bad 
apples still stain the improving 
reputation of hip hop’s culture. 
The members of rap group 
Migos have recently made the 
news multiple times for making 
homophobic 
remarks. 
From 
Offset’s 
blatantly 
ignorant 
lyric “I don’t vibe with queers” 
to 
the 
members 
expressing 
public 
disappointment 
at 
discovering their fellow rapper 
iLoveMakonnen came out as 
gay. Yet the ignorance of a few 
shouldn’t minimize the clear 
shift currently taking place in 
hip hop. The young genre has 
come a long way from its socially 
problematic beginnings.
