NSYSU party
learns about U.S.
healthcare system
By ERIC GABBARD
Daily Staff Reporter
For 26 Taiwanese graduate
students and health care profes-
sionals, a week-long visit to the
University - and to the United
States - is an experience that will
not soon be forgotten.
Taking place from July 23-27, the
School of Public Health's Depart-
ment of Health Management and
Policy is hosting the Institute of
Health Management for members
of the National Sun Yat-nen Uni-
versity. The focus of the program is
to emphasize many elements of the
U.S. health care system.
The NSYSU was established in
1980 in Kaohsiung, Taiwan and con-
tains six colleges that offer numer-
ous programs for its undergraduate,
graduate and doctoral ntudentn.
Among the vinitors are physi-
cians, surgeons, radiologists, occu-
pational therapists, administrators
and graduate students. The major-
ity of members are practicing pro-
fessionals and administrators.
Christy Lemak - associate
professor of health management
and policy who gave a presenta-
tion covering the performance of.
health organization at the event -
explained that the seminars range

intopicsfromhealthcare reformto
quality of care.
"The week was designed to meet
the expressed topical interests of
the visitors," Lemak said.
In addition to the program's
seminars, the visitors will have the
opportunity to tour the University
of Michigan Health System, the
Detroit office of Blue Cross Blue
Shield of Michigan, the Henry Ford
West Bloomfield Hospital and the
Chelsea Retirement Community.
Jersey Liang, professor of health
management and policy, is one of
the leading faculty members for
the program, along with Lemak.
originally from Taiwan, Liang
had not been to the United States
until after he had completed his
college education and began his
graduate training. Liang currently
has active research programs in
Japan, China and Taiwan and fre-
quently travels between East Asia
and the United States.
It was Liang's interaction in the
countries where he has researched
that began hin passion for hosting
international studentn and profen-
sionals in the U.S.
"Clearly, there is a very signifi-
cant interest of people from other
countries that would like to come
*to the United States," he said.
Liang added that while he hosts
studentsfrom countries like Tai-
wan, students from the United
States are also showing an "over-
whelming" interest in learning
more about countries such as

China and Japan.
Liang explained that the Public
Health School has become more
invested in programs like this
week's Institute of Health Manage-
ment in recent years.
"I think the School of Public
Health is very; very interested in
making a significant investment
in what we call the 'Global Public
Health Initiative,"' Liangsaid.
The long-term, strategic goal
of the initiative would be to reach
out to the University's peer institu-
tions abroad and establish relation-
ships so thatstudents preparing for
careers in health care can become
more exposed to other health care
systems.
As for the future of such pro-
grams as Institutes of Health
Management, Liang is optimis-
tic that the Public Health School
can expand its reach further, in
coordination with other institu-
tions. Additionally, programs may
be held for longer periods of time,
potentially for four weeks rather
than just one.
"Strategically, there may be
many possibilities," Liang said. "It
may be a mixture of web-based
instruction, as well as, having
(international students) come here
periodically, and, at the same time,
we could also send some of our stu-
dents abroad."
Liang cited the joint institute
formed between the University's
College of Engineering and the
Shanghai Jiao Tong University as

an example of collaboration that
the Public Health School is looking
to follow.
"We see all of this as possible,"
Liang said. "We would very much
like to see something like this for
the School of Public Health."
Ying-Chun Li, an associate pro-
fessor for the graduate program -
of health care management at
NSYSU, led the group from their
side of the program.
Li praised the University as an
educational institution, adding
that the visitors, including himself,
were impressed by the campus and
educational facilities.
"I think the University is a good
place for students to learn,"he said.
"That was one of the reasons why I
brought the (NSYSU) students here
this time."
One requirement of the NSYSU's
Institute of Health Care Manage-
ment is that students must spend a
semester abroad with a partnering
institution.
For students working full-time,
like the students attending this
week's program, they are allowed
to attend a much briefer program
due to their demanding schedules.
Li said the on-site visits to
UMHS weretespecially "eye-open-
ing" forthe students. He addedthat
the seminars have provided a dif-
ferent, valuable perspective of the
U.S. health care system.
Evelyn Huang, a surgical resi-
dent in Taiwan, said her time with
the University has been a new and
excitingexperience.
"The lectures and visits are
inspiring - we have new ideas and
we'll benefit alot," Huang said.

Wisconsin's Bret Bielema so, but Hoke said he determined

it wasn't worth the changes that
would result.
"It's really a personal philoso-

really is a situation that we'd rath-

"I think your emotions are

his policy.
He said the Wolverines had
built a bond that wasn't worth
messing with, or at least that their

not warrant any potential disrup-

"To be honest with you, we kind
of made a decision - I'd be lying

Meanwhile, a tense O'Brien -
undoubtedly stressed by the idea
that at least several of his players

he will play this season - did not
seem to enjoy the questions that

Silas Redd, the biggest name
involved in transfer rumors,
O'Brien simply said "no." He was
similarly terse when asked if he
had talked directly to Beckman
about the latter's intentions.
And when asked if he was sur-
prised by the conference's policy
of unrestricted transfers for Penn

thusly, also in curt fashion:
"Nothing surprises me, no, so

ber of A2A3, came up with the
idea of swimming across the Eng-
lish Channel for ALS, according to
A2A3 President Suzanne Ross.
"When (Mercer) found out that
there was a world record specifi-
cally for six women in a relay for
double-crossing, she decided that's
what she wanted to do," Ross said.
Ross said ALS is an orphan
disease because pharmaceutical
companies do not see it profitable
to invest in finding a treatment or
cure for ALS.
"We were shocked at the time
whenourmainwayofgettingmoney
was through private donations or
government grants, not the pharma-
ceutical companies," Ross said.
Ross said she concluded the best
way to support Schoeni and his
family was to raise funds specifi-
cally for ALS research.

The Channel for ALS campaign,
a collaboration of the six women
and A2A3, has raised nearly
$80,000. The funds will be used to
support research that focuses on
finding an effective treatment and
cure for ALS.
"We give all.the proceeds from
the events and donations and such
to labs doing what we call 'cure-
based research,"' Ross said.
Ross said she appreciates the
community's support of A2A3.
"This is the largest initiative
(A2A3 has) ever had, and we hope
that brings attention to-ALS as well
as the 'urgent need for research
fund," Ross said.
While the team was training to
swim across the English Channel
last March, Mercer came across
medical problems of her own when
she was diagnosed with breast can-
cer.
Ross said everyone's immediate
reaction to Mercer's diagnosis was
that they expected her to take time

off for treatment and perhaps not
swim at all.
"The more (Mercer) realized
all the treatment options she had
available to her was made pos-
sible by people who have donated
to research for breast cancer, she
became that much (more) deter-
mined to continue to cross the Eng-
lish Channel for ALS research and
for people like Bob," she said.
According to Schoeni, Mercer
had her last chemotherapy on July
9, only two and a half weeks before
the team's swim across the English
Channel.
"What an incredible inspiration
they are to me, giving me strength
as I deal with changes in my body,"
Scheoni said.-
A2A3 has funded three different
ALS research organizations - the
Robert Packard Center for ALS
Research at Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity, a nonprofit biotech com-
pany in Cambridge, Mass. and the
University of Michigan.

ALS research at the University
is conducted under Eva Feldman,
neurology professor and direc-
tor of the program for neurology
research and discovery.
Gretchen Spreitzer, professor
of organizational behavior and
human resource management and
Schoeni's wife, said Feldman and
her team plan to start a clinical
trial of intraspinal transplantation
of stem cells on ALS patients by
next month.
"It's been a selfless, amazing
story of the swimmers doing this
to raise awareness and research
funds for ALS," Spreitzer said.
Spreitzer said her husband's bat-
tle would be harder to fight without
the support from the community
and added that yesterday was the
fourth anniversary of his diagnosis.
"We appreciate the love, support
and encouragement of the Univer-
sity community every day that Bob
fights this awful disease," Spreitzer
said.

CHICAGO - The Michigan foot-
ball team was dealt a blow on Mon-
day with the indefinite suspensions
of Fitzgerald Toussaint and Frank
Clark amid legal charges.
Toussaint, a redshirt junior run-
ning back who was the starting
tailback in 2011, was arrested on
Saturday and was slapped with a
charge of operating a vehicle while
intoxicated.
Clark, asophomore candidate for
the starting weak-side defensive
end spot, was arrested and charged
with second-degree home invasion
in June after allegedly stealing a
laptop from Stockwell Hall.
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
announced the players' suspen-
sions when they surfaced Monday
and he backed up the suspension
on Thursday at the annual Big Ten
Media Days in Chicago.
"They're indefinitely suspended
right now," Hoke said. "They're
going to pay the price for poor judg-

ments, which a lot of 18- to 23-year-
old kids make, and then we'll make
a decision down the road."
Hoke said he does not know
yet whether Toussaint and Clark
will join the football team as it
opens fall camp next week. Look-
ing further into the future and the
looming season opener against
reigning-champion Alabama, Hoke
refused to forecast whether the
suspensions might be lifted before
the season.
"Obviously there's a standard of
performance we expect at Michi-
gan from an academic standpoint
to a community standpoint and
to an athletic, competition stand-
point," Hoke said.
The blame for the suspensions,
of course, goes to Toussaint and
Clark individually. But does Hoke
pin some of the blame for off-field
transgressions on the senior lead-
ership of the football team?
"You always do," Hoke said. "You
always do. That's all part of it. It's a

cess that guys go through. They're

Plans to expand
gluten-free cookies
to other gluten-free
baked goods
By PETER SHAHIN
Daily Staff Reporter
Finding a niche in today's econ-
omy may be tricky, but in Arbor
Haven Foods' case, it is oh, so
sweet.
Arbor Haven Foods isn't con-
cerned aboutgettinginto aground
war with existing bakeries over
cookie turf. Their motive is about
providing a distinct product in
response to a growing demand for
gluten-free foods.
So far, the new startup led by
University students is selling only
gluten-free chocolate chip cook-
ies, but it hopes to expand in the
near future to other product lines
including a larger variety of cook-
ies and breads.
Engineeringsenior Steve Dean,
Arbor Haven Foods president
and co-founder, said his interest
in developing gluten-free foods
grew out of his own frustration
with existing products on the
market.
Dean, having a strong gluten
allergy, said it is oftena challenge
to reconcile the label of "gluten-
free" with something that is actu-
ally appetizing.
"Really, the idea started as try-
ing to be able to feed myself some-
thing that tastes different than
Styrofoam," he said.
Dean, who received help from
the University's Center for Entre-
preneurship, started working on
the product in 2006 but began
forming a company and commer-
cial model in 2009 with his broth-
er, Josh Dean.

It was during that time that
Steve Dean started honing his
chocolate chip cookie recipe for
industrial-scale production.
"Not all of my ingredients
always play nicely together,"
Steve Dean said. "Josh was here
for one of the first cookies. He
spat the whole thing out. That's
an interesting moment when your
family and friends are so appalled
at something you fed them that
they spit it out."
Having settled on a final - and
palatable - recipe, Arbor Haven
Foods partnered with Celiac Spe-
cialties, a gluten-free bakery in
Novi, Mich. to produce commer-
cial quantities of the gluten-free
chocolate chip cookies.
The enterprise is tiny, operat-
ing the business, researchband
development out of Dean's base-
ment, but it's a start toward what
the founders hope to be a lifelong
commitment.
On the marketing side, the
company has partnered with local
vendors Espresso Royale and
Iorio's Gelateria and recently sold
products at a booth at the Ann
Arbor Street Art Fair.
Steve Dean added that the com-
pany is also working with Zinger-
man's to sell their products at the
Delicatessen and Bakehouse.
LSA senior Pauline Knighton,
vice president of Arbor Haven
Foods, said the company is cur-
rently focused on expanding
its reach to grocery stores like
Kroger.
"We're really happy with our
end product of the chocolate
chip cookie," Knighton said. "But
again, that was a couple months
of tweaking and lots of money
that needs to go into products. We
have a lot of recipes ready to go,
but it's the extra step, and extra
time and money, to get that prod-

Funds also to send
student to overnight
Wolverine Camp
next summer
By ANNA ROZENBERG
Managing News Editor
While trying to get an Oreo in
your mouth from your forehead
using only your face muscles may
seemunorthodox for most Univer-
sity events, it's exactly what Camp
Bradford called for when rain
struck earlier today.
Camp Bradford, held in West
Quad, raises money to hold a one-
day camp each summer for under-
privileged children ages 10-18 who
may not be able to afford Wolver-
ine Camps. The other part of its
budget is devoted to sending at
least one child to overnight camp
the following year.
This year, for Camp Bradford's
fourth year, it raised about $1000
- enough money to fund the day
as well as send a female camper
to a Wolverine Camp next sum-

mer, according to Kierstdea Furey,
Camp Bradford's activities coordi-
nator and LSA Junior.
Furey's job was to plan the day
for campers, much like the Oreo
game.
"We planned it so that way kids
could be outside and inside in case
of rain and weather," she said.
Furey explained that they
started off the day with tie-dying
T-shirts donated by Underground
Printing, one of Camp Bradford's
partners.
"Tie-dye was the first thing that
kids love to do," Furey said. "The
counselors like to do it, too."
There were only 14 campers
today, but Furey hopes to see the
number of campers grow in the
future.
"In the past we haven't had
good communication from year to
year, which is why it's something
we're really focusing on this year
to make sure that these kids know
about it next year," she said.
She added that the counselors
this year are making a binder to
pass on to next year's staff to help
them have a smooth transition.

Fundraising Chair Angelena
D'errico said Camp Bradford's goal
for next summer would be 40 to 50
campers, after improving aware-
ness and fundraising.
She said while this year's camp
was less than ideal size-wise, they
couldn't have held the camp with-
out their fundraising events and
their partnership with Domino's
Pizza and Underground Printing.
"We had a fundraiser with Buf-
falo Wild Wings and we made a
lot of money off of that," D'errico
said. "Domino's has been so sup-
portive all summer ... we owe
them tons."
D'errico said she and the other
counselors will stay involved at
least through the choosing pro-
cess of the student they'll send
to overnight camp next summer.
She explained that they've sent a
boy in previous years and plan on
sending a girl next summer.
"We're going to reach out to
high schools and YMCAs and-see
if they have an outstanding woman
athlete who would like to come to
camp but maybe couldn't afford to
come to camp here," she said.

Trad1tion over success
Michigan shouldn't accept any Penn State football players
This past November, a tragedy came to light at Pennsylvania State
University so horrific that the NCAA issued a severe punishment.
The head coach and several high-ranking administrators stayed
silent when they knew about Jerry Sandusky's sexual abuse of young
boys. After the NCAA deducted future scholarships from the Penn State
football program, current players were given the option to immediately
break scholarship agreements and transfer from the program without
being forced to sit out a year. These players now must decide whether to
stay at their school or continue their football careers elsewhere. Universi-
ty football coach Brady Hoke stated that he will not recruit or accept any
Penn State football players, and this is a smart decision that will maintain
the University's distance from the Penn State tragedy.

Rewardii
Freshman year, the thought
of having an essay workshopped
in front of 15 other students in
English class
terrified me. I
would sit at my
laptop and read
over my peers'
essays, amazed
at how words
I had encoun-
tered - maybe
once in a Jane ADRIENNE
Austen novel ROBERTS
- were appar- -_BERTS_
ently a part of
their vocabu-
lary. I felt as though my way of
speaking, and therefore my writ-
ing, paled in comparison.
After getting to know these stu-
dents throughout the semester, it
became apparent that they didn't
speak in18th-century English. They
talked like me. But if they wrote the
way they spoke, there would be a
few too many swear words, and
exclamation points would quickly
overtake periods.
Not many people can get away
with writing like that. But it seems
as though many tend to veer to
the opposite end of the spectrum,
resulting in writing that sounds so
foreign that a dictionary is a nec-
essary companion for reading it. It
comes off as elitist.
In an article by Ryan Bloom in
The New Yorker, he describes how
"prescriptivism is currently the
dialect of power and being able to
manipulate that dialect can help
you get ahead." According to Bloom,
using our natural dialects in writing
is a worthy goal, but it isn't reality.
Big words, correct comma usage
and structurally sound sentences
are rewarded in college classes,
articles and so on.
He's right, Stylistically, most of
us conform to the standards we've
been taught since kindergarten.
And that's expected. But what's
scary is that we, asa society, reward
the writing with the most obscure
word and style choices.
For example, growing up, I
always thought Mitch Albom was a
flawless writer. I think it was most-
ly because of name recognition, but
it was also due to the fact that I felt
like crying after reading almost
any article written by him. A few
weeks ago, a coworker informed me
that he didn't like Albom's writing
because it was predictable and he
felt as though his emotions were
being manipulated.
I was shocked to hear this, but
after reading one of his articles
again, I realized he had a point. I
wanted to cry because of the style
of the article, which consisted of
italicized, short and poignant sen-
tences combined with word choices
that wouldn't make appearances in
everyday conversation. This style of

,g eliti sm
writing is rewarded. Many consider
Mitch Albom to be a brilliant writer
- and he very well could be. But in
all honestly, no one speaks in ital-
ics while taking five-second pauses
between sentences. It's unnatural.
This style of writing can work really
well, but it shouldn't necessarily be
the best and only way to get your
point across.
Most people
don't write the
way they speak.
The problem with this is that
most students try to emulate writ-
ing of this kind. In my third grade
class, we had a project in which
we had to write a story and then
look in a thesaurus and change
some of our words. It caused me
to include the word "pungence"
in my story. And trust me, I don't
think I ever used the word = let
alone had any idea of what it even
meant - before stumbling upon
"pungence" in that thesaurus.
I stuck by that method for a
while. When my essay was being
workshopped in that first English
class at Michigan, I had a field day
with the Word Thesaurus tool, and
I can't imagine that the essay was
my best work.
It's a scary thought to write
exactly the way we speak when
grades and reputations are on the
line. We stick to what we know
works: smooth transitions, capital
letters and a rich vocabulary. That
probably won't change anytime
A small step to ending this so-
called "language elitism" is to
recognize that style doesn't neces-
sarily have to drive a piece of writ-
ing. Many of us - myself included
- are quick to love a writer or an
essay simply because we're awe-
struck at how much smarter the
writer sounds than us. It's unfortu-
nate because some ofcthe besteessays
and articles sound like the author is
having a casual conversation with
a friend. Rewarding great content
and stylistic risks is the first stop
to dethroning prescriptivism and
crowning natural dialects in the
written form.
And maybe, most importantly,
those well-placed italicized sen-
tences that evoke unnecessarytears
aren't a requirement for great writ-
ing.

Dynarski prepared a testimony
for the hearing.
In her testimony, she said the
goal of federal student aid and
education incentives is to help
people who are smart enough for
college but not wealthy enough to
pay tuition to afford their educa-
tion, adding that the programs at
the moment areinadequate.
"The current education tax
benefits do little to get more peo-
ple into college," Dynarski said.
"We should simplify and focus
the tax incentives and coordinate
them with the student aid pro-
grams."
Dynarski added that despite
growing tuition prices, education
still helps people find jobs.
"Even with record-high tuition
prices, a bachelor's degree pays for
itself several times over," Dynar-
ski said.
However, she said college is
"unequal," despite becoming
attainable for some.
"Only 9 percent of children

born in the poorest quarter of
families earn a B.A.," Dynarski
said. "The figure is 54 percent, six
times larger, for those with the
highest incomes."
Dynarski explained her worry
of this gap setting the country up
for a dim future.
"Growing education gaps
between the children of the rich
and the poor threaten this vision
of economic mobility," she said.
"We are in danger of devolving
into a rigid caste society where the
children of the poor are destined
for low education and menial
jobs."
Dynarski said higher. educa-
tion reform can help reduce the
inequality, adding that earlier
educational institutions are an
important part as well.
"There is a role for post-second-
ary policy in shrinking these gaps
... (but) it is important to under-
stand the limits of post-second-
ary policy," Dynarski said. "Gaps
in educational attainment and
achievement start early."
Dynarski explained that the
Pell Grant and the American
Opportunity Tax Credit are the
flagships of the student aid and
.tax incentive programs, adding

that the Pell Grant is especially
useful because it directs its funds
toward the neediest students.
"Just 15 percent of Pell Grant
recipients have household
incomes above $40,000 per year,
and just 3 percent over 60,000,"
Dynarski said.
Dynarski added that both pro-
grams have doubled in size over
the last two years.
In her testimonial, she outlined
the reforms she thinks to be most
prominent.
"The goals of reform should
be to focus the incentives on
those who are on the margin of
attending college, to simplify the
incentives so that families can
understand and respond to them
and to coordinate the programs,"
Dynarski wrote.
She wrote that merging the
Pell Grant and the American
Opportunity Tax Credit into a
single, refundable credit would
make the student aid process less
complex and would allow lower-
income families to receive better
benefits.
Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.)
attended the committee meeting
and said the bill he introduced on
Feb. 9 could help by forcing col-

leges and universities to release
important data that parents and
students can use to determine
which institution is the best value
for them.
Addressing this idea, Dynarski
said she thinks Wyden's bill would
do good, if passed.
"I think (Wyden's bill) would be
a great step forward to have uni-
fied, uniform info about gradua-
tion rates, about prices and about
employment rates and earnings
of graduates from institutions,"
Dynarski said. "The state of Flor-
ida has been doing this on its own,
using its own data systems, but
seeing a more uniform set of infor-
mation across the country would
be a great step."
Baucus said the committee
needed to find a way to simplify
the federal student aid programs,
which he thinks can be complex
and confusing for Americans.
"Under current law, there are
eight separate tax expenditures
related to higher education, and
these benefits use five different
definitions of 'eligible expenses,'
" he said. "Taxpayers must calcu-
late their taxes using each tax cut
to determine which one works
best."

Baucus brought a chart - only
one page out of 87 dedicated to
how to obtain education tax cred-
its - to the committee thatshowed
the IRS questionnaire that fami-
lies use to determine if they are
available for education tax credits
like the American Opportunity
Tax Credit.
"Based on the complexity of
this guide, one would think the "
IRS expected all of America's
future students to want to major
in accounting," Baucus said. "The
Government Accountability Office
will tell us today how this com-
plexity affects families. They have
found that many families often
pick the wrong benefit and leave
money on the table."
Baucus said reform is essential
for the U.S. education system to do
its job properly.
"We need to make the system
simpler for families, and we '
should improve these benefits for
students. Through tax reform,
we need to look at how we can
achieve the greatest bang for
our buck," Baucus said. "Our
entire system should work to
help, not hinder, the pursuit of an
education."

On Friday, the Big Ten held its
annual preseason media days to
discuss the upcoming football
season. Hoke stated, "It really is
a situation that we'd rather stay
out of." The current Michigan
football team has a chemistry
that he doesn't want to disrupt.
Hoke added that he wants to let
the Michigan team handle its own
business and let the Penn State
players handle their business at
their university. Conversely, other
coaches from various schools
were open to accepting former
Penn State football players.
Penn State University suf-
fered a monumental tragedy, and
the University doesn't need to
exacerbate the situation in any
way. While it is understandable
that the players would want to
leave and have the opportunity
to take their talents elsewhere,
Michigan should stay completely

isolated from the situation. The
entire Michigan community -
especially the football team -
empathizes with the Penn State
football team, but distance is
needed in this situation.
The Michiganfootballteamhas
been working toward this upcom-
ing season since the Sugar Bowl
ended in early January. Building
character, developing plays and
generating a winning team for the
2012-13 season are Hoke's goals
for his team. Adding new players
this late in the off-season would
disrupt the camaraderie of the
team, especially as players arrive
fresh from a tumultuous experi-
ence at Penn State.
The Michigan tradition and the
process of becoming a Michigan
Man is instilled in these young
men the instant they step on cam-
pus as freshmen. It's important
that Michigan respects other

schools and continues the Michi-
gan tradition. Penn State is fac-
ing a very intense punishment
- taking players away from their
team would be contradictory to
the tradition on which Michigan
prides itself. Hoke is widely dis-
playing respect for both Michigan
and Penn State by maintaining
the culture of his football team
and not interfering with the Penn
State situation.
Hoke did admit that there are
some talented players on Penn
State's team that could help
Michigan's team, but transfer-
ring them from Penn State to
Michigan is not worth the cul-
tural sacrifice of the team. "No
man is more important than the
team," Bo Schembechler famous-
ly declared in his 1983 speech
called "The Team". Michigan
isn't a place that sacrifices its cul-
ture and tradition for success.

Neighborhood 'Watch' mediocre

MICHAEL NEVITT |I Vo EWP o ial
Not so social

Schaffer's latest fails
to impress; too much
raunch, no substance
By SEAN CZARNECKI
Daily Arts Writer
It's no secret that "The Watch" is
using an old Hollywood trick: Get
a bunch of heavyweights together,
and the box office
numbers will fol-
low. Really, just
look at all that The Watch
cheddar: Penned
by Seth Rogen At Quality16
and Evan Gold- and Rave
berg ("Super-
bad"); starring Fox
Ben Stiller
("Tropic Thunder"), Vince Vaughn
("Wedding Crashers"), Jonah Hill
("21Jump Street") and Richard Ayo-
ade ("The IT Crowd"). Yet, despite
those big names, audiences should

spend their time elsewhere besides
this mash-up of insipid raunch and
inspired improv, comedy and sci-fi.
Stiller is an over-zealous, over-
involved member of a small town
community who forms a neighbor-
hood watch after his friend is mur-
dered in the local Costco, of which
he's a manager. And as you prob-
ably know, the neighborhood watch
ends up defending the world from
alien invaders.
Stiller, Vaughn, Hill, Ayoade,
Rogen, Goldberg - how did this
movie go wrong? Though it's faintly
reminiscent of "Ghostbusters" and
"Attack the Block," there's nothing
particularly wrong with the prem-
ise. What those comedians' earlier
releases had was an abundance of
knee-slapping lines, a moral (even
sentimental) core and tremendous
performances. For the most part,
"The Watch" lacks all these traits.
This second directorial feature
from Akiva Schaffer ("Hot Rod,"
also a member of Lonely Island)

does give its audience a handful
of chuckles and, every once in a
while, a hearty out-loud laugh.
The most memorable: a seemingly
improvised gag involving Vaughn
and a Russian nesting doll, tak-
ing advantage of Vaughn's rapid
fire verbosity. Yet Schaffer barely
ever exploits his actors' strengths,
instead relying on an overabun-
dance of raunch, not wit. Con-
sequently, "The Watch" quickly
becomes obnoxious.
Besides the gross-out gags, the
film's other main focus is sci-fi. The
alien invasion proves superfluous to
thelaughs. In fact,the filmwould've
fared better as a story about a group
of mismatched suburbanites in a
neighborhood watch.
There's some great ideas in
this movie. Watching Stiller as
the straight man attempting to
be as multi-cultural as possible
by befriending all the minorities
in the neighborhood is great fun.
He has no black friends - but he's

Group bowling was just the worst idea.
getting there, he says. He's the
one societal douche that hasn't
outworn his comedic fodder: the
overcompensating white man.
"The Watch" had promising racial
undertones, but ultimately pro-
vides superficial revelations.
Being edgy is not the same as
throwing out four-letter words.

You gotta dig deeper. No such
thoughtful laughter will be found
here. Story short: If you want
some real laughs, go see "Ted."
"The Watch" 's mediocre laughs
could just as effectively be repro-
duced by trading locker room sto-
ries with your friends at home, for
free.

The ceiling of the Sistine
Chapel was finished in 1512
after more than four years of
work by Michelangelo. It is
unquestionablyone of the most
beautiful and famous ceil-
ings in the world. One of the
highlights of my summer was
standing beneath this world-
famous artistic masterpiece,
awestruck. As I looked to my
side to see if the hundreds of
other fanny pack-carrying
tourists were as stricken by its
beauty as I was, I was shocked
to see numerous eyeballs star-
log at Blackberrys and iWhones
instead of at the 300-plus fig-
ures colorfully depicted above
them. It appeared that Chris
was "checking into" the Sis-
tine Chapel, while Lisa shared
a picture on her Facebook
profile of some battling naked
figures in thefamous mural
and then eagerly continued to
update her screen to check for
notifications.
In the past decade, Face-
book has proven to be an effec-
tive means for people to share
stories and images from their
lives with family, friends,
coworkers and Sarah What's-
Her-Name that theytmetattha
one party that one time. With
just the simple click of a smart-
phone touch screen, you can
"mobile-ly upload" an image
or video of a special moment to
your profile and share it with
hundreds or thousands of your
"closest" friends instantly. But
why does that random girl
from your 1th grade English
class need to experience the
Sistine Chapel with you?
The truth' is, she doesn't.
With the ever-evolving popu-
larity contest of social media,
the Facebook generation has
started to lose sight of what
is most important. Instead of
thinking about how beautiful
a landscape is, we have started
to think in terms of how many
likes or comments a picture of
it will receive. Your enjoyment

of your own life is no longer
important; what's important
now is the development of your
digital persona.
Now, sharing on Facebook
does have its advantages. It's
much simpler to post a picture
than have to send it 15 times
in e-mails to different people.
However, when your usage
becomes so excessive and
intrusive that it lessens your
ability to enjoy real-life experi-
ences, there is a problem. Social
networks should be a means of
sharing special life moments
without inhibitingthem.
This rule of thumb should
be applied to more than just
one's travels and major life
milestones. We have all seen
the group of freshmen eating
in the dining hall, each with
one eye on their chicken broc-
coli bake and the otherontheir
iPhone. While this moment
may not be as inspiring as
admiring the Sistine Chapel,
it - like all of life's moments -
is just as fleeting and special.
Before you know it, you will
be sitting on the plane back
from Europe wishing you had
eaten one more cup of gelato,
or sitting at graduation in the
Big House longing to hang out
with all of your friends one
last time.
So don't live a life destined
to be filled with social net-
work-induced regret. Take the
advice you've heard a million
times and just put the phone
away. Take a deepbreath and
enjoy where you are and what
you are doing at that very
moment. Enjoy your friends,
enjoy your food, enjoy the
Sistine Chapel and enjoy the
moments you will never have
back again. It may sound like a
Hallmark card, but it's advice
you won't regret following.
Save your Facebook-ing for
later - like when you're pro-
crastinating in the UGLi.

Our current system for funding
research is broken.
Though
that may not
be the posi-
tion of the
University,
as it's now
launching
an innova-
tive alterna-
tive called MICHAEL
MCubed that SMALLEGAN
may provide
a direction
for change.
The way academia powers
forward, claiming new victories
daily, obscures the rough edges
of the current paradigm. Let me
recall for you the saga of scientific
misconduct by Marc Hauser, the
Harvard University evolutionary
biologist - not to further tarnish
his name - but to bring some of
those edges to light.
Hauser was studying the abil-
ity of tamarin monkeys to learn
algebraic rules and in 2002 pub-
lished results in Cognition - a
journal that publishes research
about the study of the mind -
that supported his hypothesis.
To establish patterns in the mon-
keys' behavior, his team watched
video of the monkeys' behavior.
and coded the monkeys' actions.
After some questions arose
concerning Hauser's data and his
refusal to let his lab colleagues
recode his tapes, his research
assistants recoded the data with-
out his consent. Their data looked
nothing like his. Coding behav-
ior is somewhat subjective, but
what they found prompted fur-
ther investigation because the
data was so different. In the end,
Hauser was found guilty of eight
counts of scientific misconduct
and resigned from his position at
Harvard in 2011.
Hauser could, just be a bad
apple, but from an outsider's
view, academia appears to pro-
mote such "bad behavior."
Whenever I curl up with a new
issue of some bleeding edge sci-
entific journal (which I assure
you isn't often, I have a life...),
I'm always struck by the fact
that hypotheses are always con-
firmed. I haven't yet run across a
peer-reviewed article, that says,
"We thought this would happen,

but this happened instead." I
don't think it's because scientists
are always dead-on with their
intuition. It's just that there is no
room in contemporary journals
for negated hypotheses.
Journals, funding agencies and
research institutions don't seem
to think that results of failed
experiments are worth sharing.
So Hauser's hypothesis would
have to have been confirmed -
otherwise, all his team's efforts
would have been for naught.
But how did he even get to that
point - to have a hypothesis that
was essential to support? Herein
lies the problem inherent to how
research funding operates: In
order to be awarded money for a
grant proposal, your hypothesis
needs to be well on the way to
being proved correct.-
The key concept undergirding
our current system is that com-
petition creates better results.
Hence, we have the X PRIZE
Foundation, the DARPA Robotics
Challenge and National Science
Foundation receiving 40,000 pro-
posals each year and only funding
11,000. To succeed in these races,
principal investigators must do
their homework. This means that
in most cases, researchers apply
for smaller grants first, usu-
ally from their home institution.
Likely, some significant portion
of the University's $1.24 billion
it spent on research in the fiscal
year of 2011 went to projects of
this type.
*This means that by the time
you even receive a federal grant
for your idea, you've already
invested money and months of
time into gathering preliminary
supporting data. All of this makes
it increasingly "necessary" for
their careers thattheir hypoth-
eses are correct. Otherwise, all
that work can be scrapped and
shelved.
These incentives thus encour-
age explorations that are nar-
row and one more step on what's
already been done. They make
taking baby steps the prevailing
paradigm. Everheardofthe "least
publishable unit?" The really big
leaps that we need to take to solve
big problems aren't safe to talpe in
this environment. Furthermore,
solutions to these problems often
lie strewn across the borders of

multiple disciplines and funding
for interdisciplinary research is
even harder to come by.
MCubed is an
opportunity for
collaboration.
So, that's the stage upon which
MCubed, a part of the Universi-
ty's Third Century Initiative, will
enter in the fall.
MCubed, instead of taking a
merit-based approach to fund-
ing, will hand $60,000 to any
three researchers from at least
two different units who agree to
work together on a project. The
only approval for the ideas will be
mutual interest in the questions
asked. It appears that all schools,
colleges and departments in the
university will be participat-
ing, providing an unprecedented
opportunity for cross-disciplin-
ary explorations. The money can
be used to hire a postdoctoral
researcher, graduate student or
an undergraduate to work with
the team of three.
In a creative - and playful -
move, interested faculty will be
given a token that's a third of a
cube and represents $20,000.
They can only cash out the
$60,000 when they've agreed
to work with two others and the
pieces of the cube are combined.
Faculty will meet and toss around
ideas on a web platform that will
launch in the fall.
In addition to the $15 million
the program will infuse into Uni-
versity research, the initiative is
also an experiment in itself. The
Institute for Social Research
faculty will observe the collabo-
rations formed and the impact
of the results of this program.
MCubed could fall flat or be a bea-
con guiding academia away from
asking questions that we almost
know the answer to, to ones that
currently have us scratching our
head. We wait with bated breath.

would be best for Disney to leave

than clashing the modern with the
Fairytale.

Little plot, but
enough dancing to
entice audience
By JACOB AXELRAD
Editor in Chief
It's refreshingto see a movie play
to its strengths, which is precisely
what "Step Up Revolution" - the
fourth install-
ment in the fran-
chise - does so
well. Itgives audi- Step Up

the-gut, street- and Rave
wise, bootylicious
dancing. More Summit
succinctly, there's
very little in the way of storyline,
dialogue or acting. And that's OK.
The minds behind these films have
finally accepted that they don'tneed
to ask their dancer-stars to pretend
to act. That's not whatbrings people
to the theater.
What's required, rather, is a plot
that requires little thought on the
part of the audience.'So long as the
exquisitely constructed perfor-
mances connect in a kind of lin-
ear fashion, we suspend disbelief.
Because the artistry - and yes,
there is real artistic achievement
here - lies in director Scott Speer's
ability to film flash mobs the way
Peter Jackson films Middle Earth:
with a fetishistic obsession that

'Step Up' delivers the. right moves

makes them larger than life, almost
majestic.
We open with Sean (newcomer
Ryan Guzman) turning to best-
friend Eddy (Misha Gabriel, "Clerks
II") and asking, "You ready?" Eddy
smirks. "You're kidding, right?" he
responds. The two buddies then
step out of the car, initiating a flash
mob smack in the middle of Miami.
Like a dance number from a clas-
sic Hollywood musical, the street
erupts into a choreographed frenzy
showcasing the latest moves from
The Mob, an underground dance
crew trying to make a name for
themselves by winning a YouTube
competition.
The video soon goes viral, gen-
erating millions of hits within days.
And The Mob seems poised for star-
dom, but complications arise when
Sean, The Mob's front man, falls
for Emily (Kathryn McCormick,
"Fame"), the daughter of wealthy
businessman Bill Anderson (Peter
Gallagher, "American Beauty").
Anderson is intent on developing a
hotel in a historic district of Miami
where The Mob holds strong roots.
His plans don't go over well with
The Mob or his daughter, an aspir-
ing dancer with hopes of dancing in
a professional company. She joins
The Mob - both for love and to
inject a sense of "danger" into her
otherwise safe style of dance - and
a modern-day David-and-Goliath
story unfolds in dance-battle fash-
ion.
The result is an extended music
video of sorts. Imagine the best

parts of Fox's "So You Think You
Can Dance" combined with eye-
popping visual effects and cin-
ematography. In one scene a fine
art museum becomes The Mob's
stage as the dancers, clad in cam-
ouflaged costumes, peel off of the
paintings, literally bringing the art
to life. In another scene The Mob
turns to protest art as they "mob" a
city council meeting in an attempt
to save their neighborhood. This
time they adorn themselves in suits
and fedoras, mechanically mov-
ing throughout the office building,
dollar bills fluttering in the air. It
could easily be the background to
a Michael Jackson number as they
dance in fluid synchronization.
Mesmerizing doesn't even begin
to capture the feeling that's creat-
ed as camera meets dancer in this
duet for the digital age.
Unfortunately, there are occa-
sional cringe-inducing moments
where these gorgeous people have
to actually (gasp) act. In these
scenes it's disheartening to think
that you root for the villain, as
Gallagher - the only real actor of
the bunch - dominates the screen.
His lines are cheesy. His char-
acter is as thinly drawn as they
come. But this is still the man who
charmed legions of fans as Sandy
Cohen in "The O.C". He reveals
depth where the other characters
reveal little more than beautiful
smiles atop beautiful bodies.
On top of the gratuitous shots of
bikini-clad wdmen lounging pool-
side (We get it. We're in Miami)

the biggest flawisthat"Revolution"
is still restricted by the traditional
restraints of story. The poor waiter.
The rich girl with artistic ambi-
tions. The oppressive father. Corpo-
rate conglomerates pushing out the
little guy. It's like the screenwriters
reached into a bag and pulled out
the most obvious plot points that
have worked in similar movies of
the genre. Yes, Patrick Swayze and
Jennifer Grey made sparks fly as,
you guessed it, a poor waiter and
a wealthy girl in "Step Up" 's '80s
equivalent "Dirty Dancing".
But there's no need for "Revolu-
tion" to include a lame reproduc-
tion of that movie. Better to take
a note from Bollywood and let

the movement do the talking. No
pulpy emotions injected unneces-
sarily between performances. No
preachy voice-over monologues.
No moments of startling irony
(spoiler alert: the movie's finale
prompts a Nike representative
to ask The Mob if they want to
be the new face of the company.
They accept. The fact that they
work the whole movie to stave off
a hotel chain, only to sell out to a
corporation that's been accused
of using sweatshop labor since the
'70s is a paradox that's difficult to
swallow). All we really need are
the types of dance that make us
drool with envy and awe. Anything
"movie"related is secondary.

Happy- ever after, or not

By ANNA SADOVSKAYA
ManagingArtsEditor
Cinderella had a glass slipper;
Snow White had seven dwarfs; I
had a Little Mermaid costume.
Growing up with the classic Disney
princess movies, I imagined my life
os a fairytale: I'd have flowing locks,
a handsome prince and a talking
animal friend. There was some-
thing brilliant about the old movies,
despite their setbacks.
No doubt classic Disney movies
are steeped in stereotypes and rely

on sexist ideals to carry the plot,
but considering the time period in
which the Fairytale-world back-
drop was created, it made sense.
When Disney came out with
"Snow White and the Seven
Dwarfs" in 1937, women were the
center of a household - support-
ing their families by keeping a tidy
home, raising children and not
being wasteful with money. "If you
let me stay, I'll keep house for you.
I'll wash and sew and sweep and
cook ... " says Snow White when the
dwarfs find her sleeping in their

beds. She automatically concedes
to the female role of the 1930s,
presenting her usefulness and
value through the homemaker
personality.
Likewise, released in 1950,
"Cinderella" echoed America's
attitude towards women - obe-
dient wives, obedient daughters.
Cinderella was a quiet, compliant
girl that cleaned and cooked. She
was rewarded for her submissive
behavior with a Prince - someone
to give her a bigger, nicer home to
