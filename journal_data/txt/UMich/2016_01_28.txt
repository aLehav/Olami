Life and Death in A2

Ann Arbor 

carefully monitors 
filtration systems 
to avoid potential 

harm

By BRIAN KUANG

Daily Staff Reporter

As the water crisis in Flint 

dominates national headlines, 
local attention has turned to 
Ann Arbor’s water system — 
specifically, a case of possible 
contamination in the city’s 
groundwater.

From 1966 to 1986, Gelman 

Sciences 
of 
Ann 
Arbor 

manufactured medical filters 
using dioxane, a potentially 
dangerous organic compound, 
subsequently 
contaminating 

the 
city’s 
surrounding 

groundwater with the toxic 
substance 
1,4-dioxane. 

Gelman, 
acquired 
by 
Pall 

Life 
Sciences 
in 
1997, 
is 

currently held by the Danaher 
Corporation, who acquired it 
in 2015.

Since 1992, Gelman Sciences 

has been held legally liable by 
the Environmental Protection 
Agency for monitoring and 
cleanup of the contamination; 
this 
responsibility 
has 

been passed on to Gelman’s 
successor companies.

Currently, both Pall Life 

Sciences and the Michigan 
Department of Environmental 
Quality 
independently 
test 

samples 
from 
monitoring 

wells several times a year.

The plume of contaminated 

water is heavily monitored to 
avoid 
human 
consumption 

and is undergoing gradual 
cleanup. 
More 
than 
120 

private wells in the city have 
been closed since 1985 due 
to the contamination, but it 
is currently not considered 
a danger to the overall city 
water supply.

dioxane here, and in my

For the Daily

Cumulatively, 
nearly 
40 

million Americans carry 1.3 
trillion dollars worth of student 

debt and one out of every 
four Americans are either in 
delinquency or default, Susan 
Collins, dean of public policy, 
said to a full room of 100 at 
Weill Hall Wednesday.

At the University specifically, 

she noted, last year’s graduating 
class 
cumulatively 
owed 

$35,000.

In light of those numbers, 

Collins led a discussion with 
Susan Dynarski, professor of 
public policy, education and 

economics, and Rohit Chopra, 
senior adviser of the U.S. 
Department of Education, about 
whether there is a student debt 
crisis in the U.S.

According 
to 
Dynarski, 

University students often aren’t 
the ones at risk of defaulting on 
their student loans.

“Erase from your mind the 

image of a Yale graduate, NYU 
graduate, a Columbia graduate 
or even a U of M graduate — 
in fact, anyone who graduates 

with a BA is relatively unlikely 
to default (on their student 
loans),” she said.

Rather, Dynarski said the 

average victim of student debt 
crisis is a college dropout from 
a non-selective, community or 
for-profit college.

“(Those who) grew up poor, 

entered college late, in their 
20s or 30s, to improve their job 
market skills,” Dynarski said.

Michigan hires 

former UConn A.D. 
to same position, 
source confirms

By LEV FACHER AND SIMON 

KAUFMAN

Daily Sports Writer and Daily 

Sports Editor

Warde Manuel, the current 

athletic director at Connecticut 
and a former Michigan football 
player, will become Michigan’s 
next athletic director, a source 
close to the Connecticut athletic 
department 
said 
Wednesday 

in an interview with the Daily, 
confirming earlier reports from 
the Detroit Free Press and ESPN.

Manuel will replace interim 

Athletic Director Jim Hackett, 
who has held the post since 
Dave Brandon’s resignation in 
October 2014.

Connecticut has yet to publicly 

confirm 
Manuel’s 
departure. 

According to the source, who 
spoke 
on 
the 
condition 
of 

anonymity because he was not 
yet authorized to speak publicly 
on the matter, Manuel met 
with the university’s board of 
trustees Wednesday morning. 
Susan Herbst, the university’s 
president, 
acknowledged 

Manuel’s exit to donors and 
others close to the program 
following the meeting.

In a November interview 

with the Daily at the Battle 4 
Atlantis basketball tournament 
in the Bahamas, Manuel spoke 
effusively of Michigan football 
coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh 
and 

Hackett, but declined to answer 
questions about his long-term 
interest in making the jump to 
Ann Arbor.

Manuel 
was 
Harbaugh’s 

teammate in 1986, when the 
Schembechler-led 
Wolverines 

won the Big Ten, and he has 
made no secret of his love for his 
alma mater.

Fisher 
and 

Adam 
Rountrey, 
manager 

of the Research Museum 
Vertebrate 
Collection, 

gathered to discuss the find’s 
significance and future plans 
for its display.

Fisher worked with farmer 

James Bristle, who found the 
remains, and a team of both 
graduate and undergraduate 
students on the excavation, 
and over the course of a 
single day they uncovered a 
significant amount of fossil

Rountrey on the story of the 
discovery and some of their 
work in the time following 
and 
included 
time 
for 

conversations at individual 
tables based on prompted 
discussion questions.

mammoth specimen provides 
insights into the creature’s 
life and interactions with 
humans. Additionally, Fisher

LSA-SG passes resolution to 
support BSU efforts in Flint

$6,000 also 

allocated to SAPAC 

budget at weekly 

meeting

By CAMY METWALLY

 Daily Staff Reporter

LSA Student Government 

passed 
several 
resolutions 

at 
a 
meeting 
Wednesday 

night focusing on community 
outreach and inclusivity.

“We’re 
really 
beginning 

to make a difference and 
beginning to make a lot of 
change on campus, ” LSA-SG 
President Jason Colella, an 
LSA senior, said. “And that’s 
really heartening and makes 
me proud to be in SG tonight.”

In response to the Flint 

water crisis, LSA-SG passed a 
resolution which authorized 
a $1,000 donation to deliver 

clean water to the community. 
The money will be transferred 
from 
the 
Executive 

Discretionary section of the 
budget to the Black Student 
Union. The BSU created a 
GoFundMe account to buy and 
distribute clean water to the 
people of Flint.

LSA-SG treasurer Patrick 

Mullan-Koufopoulos, 
LSA 

sophomore and co-sponsor of 
the resolution, stressed the 
importance of solidarity and 
support.

“We do have a sister campus 

in Flint,” Mullan-Koufopoulos 
said. 
“They’re 
Wolverines. 

They bleed blue just as much 
as you and I do. They’re the 
leaders and best just as much 
as we are, and they’re in 
crisis.”

Public Policy senior Hattie 

McKinney, vice speaker of 
BSU, spoke to LSA-SG prior 
to voting. She said BSU plans 
raise at least $10,000 to buy 

water bottles and distribute 
them in Flint.

McKinney 
explained 

that many of the minority 
populations in Flint don’t feel 
comfortable 
with 
officers 

coming 
to 
their 
doors, 

stressing the importance of 
student efforts in the city.

“We’re figuring out a way 

to coordinate water donations 
with our connections with the 
schools,” McKinney said.

LSA-SG 
plans 
to 
visit 

Flint next Friday as well to 
contribute to the cause.

“You’re 
supporting 

our 
sister 
campus, 
you’re 

supporting the students who 
are there, you’re supporting 
the people of the town and 
really 
you’re 
just 
making 

the 
stance 
that 
says, 
‘as 

Southeastern Michigan, we 
stand together,’ ” LSA-SG 
external relations officer Joey 
Hansel, an LSA junior, said.

Supporting the immediate 
campus as well, LSA-SG 
passed a resolution to donate 
$6,000 from the budget to 
SAPAC. Of the total budget, 
$2,000 will be allocated 
toward three volunteer- and 
peer-led support groups to 
further 
raise 
awareness, 

enhance 
workshops 
and 

expand 
events. 
Another 

$2,000 will fund a new event 
SAPAC plans to host this 
semester that will involve 
other universities in the 
state.

An allocation of $1,000 

[COPY: they mention that 
there is $6,000 going to 
SAPAC, but only expand on 
$5,000 of allocations] will be 
made to a survivor care fund 
aiming to provide survivors 
with a greater sense of safety 
and security — the money 
can be used for hotel rooms, a 
new phone and lock changes. 
This money goes directly 
to survivors, and Mullan-
Koufopoulos 
stressed 
the 

importance of this program.

“I 
wanted 
to 
make 

sure we were making an 

impact on campus,” Mullan-
Koufopoulos 
said. 
“And 

something 
Holly 
Rider-

Milkovich said stuck with 
me — she is the director of 
SAPAC. She was talking about 
how one in three females on 
this campus will experience 
an attempted sexual assault.”

LSA junior Laura Meyer, 

SAPAC Networking, Publicity 
and 
Activism 
program 

coordinator, appreciated the 
contribution and addressed 
LSA-SG 
Wednesday. 
She 

stressed that the donation 
would 
contribute 
to 

groundbreaking work.

“It’s difficult to quantify the 

difference that an amount of 
money this size is going to make 
to what SAPAC does,” Meyer 
said. “It really is going to make 
a great amount of change.”

Meyer also mentioned that 

more survivors are seeking 
services, and to accommodate 
the 
increasing 
demand, 

SAPAC plans to hire a new 
professional 
staff 
member. 

She 
said 
the 
increasing 

demand for services is a result 
of the greater accessibility 
and awareness on campus.

Mullan-Koufopoulos asked 

how LSA-SG can participate in 

non-monetary ways. Speakers 
mentioned 
ally 
training, 

funding and participation in 
SAPAC’s activism week in 
April.

LSA-SG 
also 
passed 
a 

resolution in favor of naming 
the new Biological Sciences 
building 
after 
President 

Emeritus Mary Sue Coleman. 
LSA expects the construction 
of the building to be completed 
by Jan. 1, 2018.

LSA-SG noted that Coleman 

and President Emeritus Lee 
Bollinger are the only two 
former University presidents 
without buildings named after 
them. It also highlights that 
there are no campus academic 
buildings solely named after 
a 
woman. 
Acknowledging 

the 
underrepresentation 
of 

women in STEM fields, the 
resolution supports naming 
the building after Coleman.

Graduating 
with 
an 

undergraduate 
degree 
in 

chemistry and receiving a 
doctorate 
in 
biochemistry, 

Coleman was a woman in the 
biomedical field. It further 
outlines her qualifications and 
contributions to the University.

The resolution recognizes 

her 
contributions 
to 
the 

University, such as developing 
greater 
international 
and 

corporate 
partnerships. 

Numerous 
initiatives 
have 

benefited 
the 
University, 

such as her commitment to 
expanding 
sustainability 

research.

Most of the members voted 

in support of the resolution, 
emphasizing the importance 
of 
such 
a 
resolution 
in 

furthering 
inclusivity 
on 

campus.

However, LSA junior Yong-

Joon Kim pointed out that 
some students on campus 
expressed reservations about 
naming 
a 
building 
after 

Coleman. While he was in 
support of the resolution and 
noted the importance of such 
a vote in the representation 
of women and inclusivity, 
he said certain constituents 
disapproved 
of 
Coleman’s 

practices, 
which 
they 

described as the “privatization 
of the University.”

“I urge you to vote yes for 

this resolution simply because 
we are making history,” Kim 
said. “This is very important 
for diversity and inclusivity on 
campus … I ask you to honor 
people for the right things.”

and solar.

Ian Hiskens, professor of 

electrical 
engineering 
and 

computer science, said the 
energy transition has several 
impacts on the electric grid.

“The 
main 
issue 
with 

renewables 
is 
variability,” 

Hiskens said. “Output for 
a coal power station can be 
fixed and controlled. If you 
deal with a wind farm, you 
have no control over the 
output. The energy grid needs 
to be upgraded to manage 
fluctuations and variability.”

Pascal 
Van 
Hentenryck, 

professor of industrial and 
operations engineering and 
the leader of the project, 
said 
the 
change 
alters 

fundamentals 
about 
how 

energy grids function.

“As we push the frontier as 

to how much renewable energy 
can be put in the network, 
the basic assumptions of the 
grids are no longer true,” 
Van Henternyck said. “We 
need to change the way the 
system operates by altering 
the algorithm that determines 
the balance of electricity in 
different places.”

As 
an 
example 
of 
an 

alteration, he cited a possible 
need to import and ship solar 
energy from sunny places like 
Arizona to elsewhere in the 
United States.

Most existing test cases 

that transmission operators 
draw from have become “toy 
problems”, Van Hentenryck 
said, 
making 
them 
not 

necessarily 
reflective 
of 

today’s complex networks.

To mitigate this dearth of 

realistic data sets, the team 
will embark on a multi-phase 
two-year 
project, 
one 
of 

the seven funded by the $11 
million Advanced Research 
Projects 
Agency-Energy 

(ARPA-E) program run by the 
Department of Energy.

The first phase of the project 

involves 
data 
acquisition 

and modeling. This includes 
monitoring the life of existing 
power networks to obtain a 
year-long series of data. Since 
retrieving 
real 
data 
from 

the United States is difficult 
due to security concerns, the 
group plans to partner with 
French utility firm, Réseau 
de 
Transport 
d’Électrique. 

The data from French and 
European 
networks 
then 

have to be modeled into an 
intelligible format.

For the modeling phase, 

Hiskens, 
a 
former 
power 

engineer in Australia, said he 
hopes to use his knowledge 
about realistic power system 
domains.

“We 
are 
interested 
in 

building 
data 
sets 
with 

numbers, 
parameters 
and 

variables that are sensible 
when 
evaluated 
from 
the 

perspective of a real power 
system,” Hiskens said. “I will 
be involved in making sure 
that formats and structures 
developed are sufficiently rich 
to capture the idiosyncrasies 
of power systems.”

However, 
he 
noted 
the 

difficulty in capturing the 
uniqueness and intricacy of 
power systems.

“Ultimately we need to 

establish a format that is 

complex, flexible yet useable. 
This way, others who want 
to work on power system 
optimization can test new 
algorithms based on the data 
sets, building a community 
pool of information.

Given 
the 
sensitivities 

of 
using 
real 
data, 
Van 

Hentenryck hiding some data 
while interpreting the overall 
picture will also be a challenge.

“We will have to use the 

algorithm to obfuscate data 
that is sensitive, such that the 
real data is unrecoverable,” 
Van Hentenryck. “Sometimes 
we 
get 
aggregated 

consumption profile, meaning 
that we need to desegregate 
the data into as fine-grained as 
possible.”

The next phase of the 

project would be to generate 
synthetic benchmark data that 
are not identical, but similar 
to reality. Subsequently, the 
team will have to validate its 
processes and findings, as well 
as place the test cases on an 
accessible portal.

The 
University 
team 

will also work closely with 
researchers 
from 
the 
Los 

Alamos National Laboratory, 
which has a long history 
of 
providing 
capability 

and support to the federal 
government in modeling and 
simulating power systems.

Russell Bent, who works 

as a scientist in Los Alamos, 
said 
industry-academia-

government collaboration is 
highly important in improving 
the 
United 
States’ 
power 

systems.

“My role at Los Alamos 

is 
to 
develop 
underlying 

schemas that describe all the 

components of power systems 
in their complexity,” he said. 
“We hope to take a closer 
look at some of the synthetic 
problems and test cases being 
created and make sure there is 
a realistic flavor to them.”

The ultimate goal, Bent said, 

is to build better, more efficient 
algorithms and computational 
methods for federal customers 
— the transmission operators.

Van Hentenryck said the 

grant will largely go into 
recruiting 
and 
sponsoring 

manpower for the project. 
Currently, 
researchers 

from 
Columbia 
University 

and California Institute of 
Technology 
are 
working 

alongside the University team. 
He said he hopes to assemble 
a team of 15 to 20, comprising 
undergraduate, 
graduate, 

Ph.D. and post-doc students.

Though there are multiple 

milestones that the team is 
expected to reach, the project’s 
ultimate success in power 
optimization is indeterminate 
at this point, researchers said.

Van 
Hentenryck 
likened 

the project to an exploration 
phase.

“We know where we are 

going, but we don’t know 
what we are going to find,” 
he said. “So here we are going 
to generate these test cases, 
but we don’t really know how 
well we can solve them or if 
the solution can be scalable 
for 
future 
networks 
that 

incorporate more renewable 
energy.”

Nonetheless, he said, he is 

excited about the potential of 
the project.

“It’s not every day that you 

can change the world.”

University students 
receive Hopwood 
Awards

The University Hopwood 

Awards program recently 
bestowed almost $29,000 to 
students who entered the Avery 
and Jule Hopwood Underclassmen 
Contest for creative writing.

These awards are the oldest 

writing awards for college-level 
writers, and are supported by an 
endowment from University alum 
Avery Hopwood, a Broadway 
playwright from the 1920s. The 
writer gave one-fifth of his estate 
to the University in hopes of 
encouraging creative writing. 
The University has given over 
3,200 students a total of over 
$3,000,000, according to the 
LSA Hopwood Awards Program 
website. Famous playwright and 
creative author, Arthur Miller has 
also won Hopwood Awards.

Winners received awards based 

on categories such as fiction, 
nonfiction and poetry. 

A ceremony for the award-

winners was held Wednesday in 
the Rackham Amphitheater with 
a reading by Marge Piercy, four-
time Hopwood Award winner. 

 

Children with 
half- and step-
siblings exhibit 
aggressive habits

About one in six children living 

in the United States live with half- 
or step-siblings just before they 
enter kindergarten, according to 
recent University research.

Paula Fomby, a sociologist at 

the Institute for Social Research, 
conducted the study and found 
that these children also behave 
more aggressively more often than 
children who do not live with half- 
or step-siblings. 

Though many similar studies 

have focused on how family 
complexity affects children’s 
development and look at the 
marital status of the parents and 
their relationship to the children 
living in the home, Fomby said 
most of the children with complex 
sibling relationships do not live 
with step-parents. Rather, they 
often live with a single mother or 
both biological parents.

The study used data from 

a sample of nearly 6,500 U.S. 
children and their families. Other 
factors that explained the increased 
aggression in some children include 
financial resources, the mother’s 
parenting style and the absence of 
either parent.

 ‘U’ endorses 
HPV vaccination 
as preventative 
measure for cancer 

The University Comprehensive 

Cancer Center joined 69 other 
top cancer centers across the 
country in releasing a statement 
encouraging people to receive 
the human papillomavirus 
vaccination as a preventative 
measure for cancer. The 
statement is in response to low 
vaccination rates among all 
demographics. 

Low national vaccination 

rates have resulted from a lack 
of physicians recommending the 
vaccine to their patients and a 
misconception in parents who do 
not realize the vaccine’s potential 
to be effective in preventing 
certain types of cancers. 

The Centers for Disease 

Control and Prevention released 
information stating that HPV 
infections are the cause of nearly 
27,000 cancer diagnoses in the 
country. Though girls have 
more often received the vaccine 
than boys, still no more than 40 
percent of girls and 21 percent 
of boys have received all three 
recommended doses. 

Ted Lawrence, director of 

the University Comprehensive 
Cancer Center, said in a press 
release that the goal of the center 
is to conquer cancer, and by 
encouraging people to receive the 
HPV vaccine, the center becomes 
closer to achieving that goal.

opinion 
the 
state 
has 
done 

nothing on it,” Petainen said. 
“Today Snyder promised to work 
harder on these issues, hold him 
to it if he’s not recalled.”

“He has consistently ignored 

the environment as he aimed for 
profits. But in the process, he 
forgot about his true customer. 
His customers should not have 
been the businesses, but the 
people 
of 
this 
great 
state,” 

Petainen added.

1,4-dioxane has been linked 

to cancer and can cause nervous, 
liver and kidney damage in large 
amounts. 
The 
Environmental 

Protection 
Agency 
linked 
a 

dioxane concentration of 3.5 
parts per billion in groundwater 
to a one in 100,000 incidence rate 
of cancer in a 2010 report.

According 
to 
Kristen 

Schweighoefer, the Washtenaw 
County Environmental Health 
director, computer models show 
the plume is also slowly moving 
eastward and northeast, which 
may reach Ann Arbor’s principal 
water sources of Barton Pond 
and the Huron River after an 
extended time frame.

“There is some thought that 

the plume may eventually reach 
Barton 
Pond 
or 
the 
Huron 

River,” Schweighoefer wrote in 
an e-mail. “The timeframe is not 
known, but may be decades or 
hundreds of years or more away.”

She added there are monitoring 

systems in place to prevent this 
contamination from reaching the 
public.

During the public commentary 

period of the Jan. 19 Ann Arbor 
City Council Meeting, Ann Arbor 
resident Kai Petainen connected 
the Flint crisis to Ann Arbor’s 
contamination in urging the city 
council push for more state action 
regarding the underground hole 
of dioxane (called a plume), and 
criticized Gov. Rick Snyder’s (R) 
lack of response to it.

Ann 
Arbor 
Environmental 

Coordinator 
Matthew 
Naud 

said though dioxane has been 
detected in private wells, routine 
tests of city water have never 
detected any dioxane, let alone 
any near the hazard threshold of 
3.5 parts per billion maintained 
by the EPA.

“For anybody drinking city 

water, there is no risk,” Naud 
said. “That being said, there are 
areas in the county where it is 
showing up in private wells … in 
subdivisions outside the city there 
is a chance of contamination.”

Despite assurances that there 

was no immediate risk and that 
this issue is completely separate 
from 
Flint, 
both 
Naud 
and 

Schweighoefer said the crisis in 
Flint has drawn more attention to 
their work regarding the dioxane 
plume.

“(The

to be a hybrid between the 
two known North American 
mammoth 
species: 
the 

Columbian mammoth and 
the woolly mammoth.

Fisher said he is most 

excited about what this 
discovery can uncover about 
early human’s relationships 
with mammoths.

“I think the most exciting 

thing and most important 
thing is the nature of human 
impact on these animals,” 
he said. “The early people 
who immigrated to this 
continent were seeing these 
animals 
and 
they 
were 

critical to their livelihood. 
We are humans; we are 
interested 
in 
our 
own 

history.”

As part of the discussion, 

the 
museum 
directors 

asked 
for 
suggestions 

from the public on how to 
display the specimen. The 
museum already plans to 
display the entirety of the 
skull and create a mold and 
cast of the tusk to place 
into the skull. The tusks 
were removed from the 
skull in order to safely dry 
and study them.

Rountrey 
also 
said 
a 

larger 
project 
on 
fossil 

display by the Museum of 
Natural History is currently 
underway, which aims to 
create 3D models of the 
University’s collection of 
fossils to be viewed online.

Rountrey 
said 
this 

is 
important 
because 
it 

would 
allow 
researchers 

to examine fossils without 
having to physically move 
them, risking damage.

“The models are valuable 

not just in making a nice 
website,” he said. “They 
serve in some ways to 
protect the specimen.”

LSA 
freshman 
Bailey 

Rousseau said he found the 
concept of a hybrid species 
fascinating.

“I 
think 
it’s 
pretty 

interesting how it might be 
a hybrid of the two known 
pachyderm-like 
species 

from the Ice Age,” he said.

Kira Berman, assistant 

director of the Museum of 
Natural History, said the 
discovery is a thrilling one 
for the University.

“It’s just so exciting to 

have such a large exciting 
fossil that’s found so close,” 
she said. “It has such an 
importance in terms of what 
we know about Michigan’s 
prehistory.”

by those individuals are usually 
small, she added — typically 
around $5,000 to $10,000.

Thus, the “crisis” really only 

affects those who have a low 
income following graduation 
or an incomplete education, 
Dynarski said.

“In my opinion, if there is a 

crisis of any sorts, it’s a crisis of 
low earnings in our country,” 
she said. “We lack a safety net 
to handle a very large number 
of people who are receiving 
very low earnings and who 
cannot handle even $5,000 in 
debt as a result.”

Chopra 
said 
from 
his 

experiences, which he said 
had given him a “consumer 
financial market perspective, 
other bills and responsibilities 
contribute to the student debt 
problem and debt alone is not 
the issue.

“When 
someone 
is 

delinquent on their student 
loans, it is often just one side of a 
broader array of shocks that are 
happening in their life: fighting 
to keep paying rent, struggling 
to make payments on their car 
loan … the trauma that they’re 
managing is something that we 
always have to keep at the top 
of mind,” he said.

Chopra also noted various 

policies 
currently 
being 

pursued 
to 
counteract 
his 

definition of the issues with 
student debt, specifically citing 
loan repayment plans.

“This is a broad expansion of 

affordable loan modifications 
… that allow borrowers to pay 
a reasonable amount of income 
to manage those times of 
distress,” he said.

Along 
with 
whether 
a 

student 
debt 
crisis 
exists, 

another question for Chopra 
and Dynarski came both from 
multiple 
audience 
members 

and online viewers: “Why not 
make college free?”

Chopra said there is an effort 

to essentially make community 
college free or nearly free, 
arguing that if society believes 
getting a degree is critical for a 
person’s future, it needs to be 
readily available.

Last 
January, 
President 

Barack 
Obama 
proposed 

making two years of community 
college free for students who 
met certain requirements. The 
proposal is currently stalled 
before committee in Congress, 
and faces a significant uphill 
battle in both chambers given 
that both are GOP-controlled.

Chopra 
noted 
that 
how 

tuition is made free and also 
to whom it is made free needs 
to be taken into account when 

considering 
free 
college 

proposals, adding that people 
with lower incomes should not 
view cost as an impediment.

Dynarski said historically 

college has been free, citing 
nominal costs in the ‘60s and 
‘70s. Free community college, 
she said, would be a return to 
that era.

Referring 
back 
to 
the 

discussion 
about 
the 
debt 

crisis, she added that free 
college would be an effective 
way of controlling it because 
many minorities and first-
generation 
college 
students 

attend community colleges.

Public 
Policy 
graduate 

student Joshua Rivera, who 
attended the event, said he 
enjoyed 
the 
back-and-forth 

engagement 
between 
the 

speakers regarding a relevant 
topic.

“I am deeply interested in 

education policy and I thought 
that it was a wonderful event,” 
he said. “It’s nice to have 
Professor 
Dynarski, 
who’s 

been writing in the field very 
extensively in The New York 
Times, but also to have someone 
who’s going to work for the 
Department 
of 
Education 

(Chopra) give their perspective 
and so it was interesting and 
humorous to see them kind of 
engage in these issues and their 
respective roles.”

T

he current Powerball jackpot sits at 
a measly $75 million, and well out-
side of news coverage, too; it’s a mere 

fraction of the record $1.5 
billion jackpot set a few 
weeks ago that dominated 
headlines and office water-
cooler conversations.

Perhaps it’s out of the 

news for more pragmatic 
reasons as well. Math-
ematics is a form of prag-
matism, in my opinion. For 
a mere $2, you can play 
one in 292,201,338 odds 
to hit all six numbers and 
take the jackpot. Working 
out the expected value for such a play, or the 
return on investment in a sense, is difficult 
since it depends on the prize amounts and 
number of players, but excluding those fac-
tors gives an expected value of somewhere 
around negative $1.42. Once you include 
splitting the earnings with other winners in 
the same prize tier, as well as paying taxes on 
the earnings, reduced cash value if prizes are 
taken in the lump sum and inflation on prizes 
taken as annuity, at some point for the lower 
jackpots the cost of paper 
and ink for the ticket is 
worth more than its pos-
sible earnings value. Even 
at the record $1.5 billion 
jackpot, a ticket was only 
worth about $1.32.

Nobody should be sur-

prised at these figures. 
Like any form of gambling, 
the lottery is carefully 
formulated and mathe-
matically plotted out such 
that the odds are against 
the players, so that the 
house, or in this case the 
state, can make money. 
The Powerball officials 
certainly know this, and use it to their advan-
tage. Changes to the Powerball rules reduced 
the odds of winning the jackpot specifically 
so that it could grow to record heights and 
draw in more ticket buyers through the viral 
media billions of dollars tends to generate. 
With the odds in their favor, the Powerball 
makes more money, even if someone wins the 
jackpot. The odds are against the players in 
extreme ways at these lower jackpot values, 
and it’s these players playing at these low 
jackpot levels who drive up the jackpot of the 
Powerball. It’s unlikely there’s a winner any-
time soon, as it takes more than 300 million 
tickets in play before the odds of a winner 
become more favorable, and thus the Power-
ball and lottery news will be out of the daily 
news cycle. But it’s the demographics of these 
players who regularly play and drive the jack-
pot up that show the nasty, predatory nature 
of the lottery.

Citizens from impoverished counties play 

the lottery at much higher rates than resi-
dents of wealthy counties. Tickets are bought 
in significantly disproportionate amounts by 
those who are unemployed and lower class, 

and those who lack secondary or post-sec-
ondary education. One study showed that 71 
percent of lottery players would use the win-
nings to pay off debt, a clear sign of financial 
instability worsened by the poor investment 
strategy of playing the lottery. While the old 
adage of “the lottery is a tax on the mathe-
matically challenged” is somewhat demean-
ing, the regular players of the lottery, and 
those buying tickets that drive up the Power-
ball jackpot in its early stages of the cycle, are 
the ones who cannot afford the repercussions 
of playing. The lottery, like any form of gam-
bling, has the potential to be addictive and 
destructive, and lower socioeconomic status 
has been shown to be a significant risk factor 
for developing into a problem gambler.

This money, essentially a voluntary tax, 

goes directly to the state; on average, the lot-
tery pays out 62 percent of its revenue as win-
nings, and thus represents a 38-percent tax 
rate on purchases. The moral dubiousness of 
fundraising at the expense of citizens who 
can least afford this tax would be offset by 
tying the lottery to the one cause people tend 
to be in universal favor of: education funding. 
Yet, studies show that the lottery fails to pro-
vide any benefit to education itself, as not only 

do non-lottery states pro-
vide more funding in their 
budgets than lottery states 
with lottery revenues, but 
after the implementation 
of a lottery, states tended 
to 
decrease 
education 

expenditures, and often 
directed the earmarked 
funds to other causes 
anyway. The lottery has 
become 
nothing 
more 

than an obstacle to insti-
tuting sensible tax policies 
and budgets that prop-
erly and morally support 
education, at the expense 
of an already marginal-

ized lower class. The mantra that the lottery 
is good for education is nothing more than a 
fraudulent explanation to plug holes in a state 
budget with decreased debate. The lottery 
draws in a lot of money from a small pool of 
players: Depending on the state and study, 70 
to 80 percent of lottery revenues come from 
20 to 30 percent of the players. The lottery 
doesn’t affect the majority of tax-paying citi-
zens and thus there is not much of an axe to 
grind with the process. It sets up the lottery as 
nothing more than a political ploy.

Nobody is going to win the Powerball 

jackpot for some time. The amount will con-
tinue to balloon to some astronomical num-
ber, sparking a situation in which the media 
sends buyers into a frenzy, tickets are bought 
and news stories are written about how the 
lives of the winners are forever changed. Yet 
the important stories will come in the weeks 
after, in the stories of the lives of those who 
will buy the tickets in vain. Their lives, too, 
are changed, one loss at a time.

Foregoing the lottery

Psychologists, therapists, sociolo-

gists, etc. all claim through research 
to have the cure for what has become 
the modern-day disease plaguing 
relationships: divorce. There are 
many statistics out there for the cor-
rect and accepted divorce rate. Some 
sources claim the rate of all mar-
riages ending in divorce is upward 
of 50 percent, while others cite it as 
being closer to 30 percent. Whatever 
the number, it is still disturbing and 
worthy of inquiry to study why so 
many marriages end tragically. Being 
divorce conscious and researching in 
depth what really makes a healthy 
marriage or relationship seems coun-
terintuitive. People have maintained 
successful and happy relationships 
in the past, so why does divorce seem 
like such an issue now? Perhaps 
the answer to the question of why 
divorce happens is simpler than so 
much research tries to explain.

My personal experience with 

divorced parents has shaped the way 
I view the study of relationships as 
well as these statistics that so many 
professionals try not only to explain, 
but also to prevent from increasing. 
My parents divorced when I was 10 
years old, resulting in my mom leav-
ing the house and moving to a neigh-
boring city to be close to my brother 
and me. Each of my parents, prior to 
their relationship with each other, 
had divorced their first spouses as 
well. Now, both of my parents have 
moved on to third marriages. While 
this may seem insane to some who 
have no experience with divorce, 
it became very common to me as I 
grew up and began to develop as my 
own person.

As a child, growing up in what is 

often termed a “broken household,” 
I quickly became aware that there 
was barely a difference between my 
parents and my friends’ parents who 
were still together after X years of 
marriage. My parents fought, their 
parents fought, too. My parents 
were able to be happy around each 
other for the sake of their children, 
and those other parents who were 
still together were able to be happy 
despite fighting, too. So what made 
my parents so different from those 

other ones who were able to stay 
together? Only since moving out and 
coming to college have I discovered 
any real answer to this question. I 
can now view my own family from an 
outsider’s perspective after not living 
at home for six months or so, but still 
receive the details of what is going 
on and who said what in this fight or 
another. This has helped me realize 
that the secret to a lasting relation-
ship may be easier to find than I orig-
inally perceived.

Communication is key. Yes, I 

think the solution to keeping two 
people together indefinitely is as 
simple as being able to effectively 

communicate with each other. When 
referring to communication here, 
I am not suggesting that talking at 
one’s spouse will save a marriage. 
However, being able to objectively 
express one’s emotions, grievances 
and thoughts to another person, 
hearing and allowing the other per-
son to reciprocate and be listened 
to is the huge secret to the success-
ful maintenance of any relationship. 
This communication, if completed in 
a manner that allows both people to 
feel heard and respected, can resolve 
any issue that may arise and create 
an air of intimacy between people.

The research done on the subject 

of divorce that most parallels this 
idea of communication being the 
most important aspect to a healthy 
relationship comes from the work 
of psychologist John Gottman, 

who has studied relationships for 
more than four decades. His work 
has shown that when comparing 
groups of couples who have main-
tained their relationships to groups 
of couples who have split up, there 
are a few defining characteristics 
that separate and explain why the 
people who stayed together were 
able to stay together, and why those 
who separated were not able to stay 
together. From this research, Gott-
man found that physiologically, 
those who stayed together main-
tained calmer and more trusting 
states during conversation while 
those who had split up were con-
tinually 
showing 
flight-or-fight 

responses, even when discussing 
simple events from the day. The 
ability to trust and feel respected 
and happy during conversation 
comes directly from practicing 
 
 

effective communication.

Proper communication extends 

further from the topics that are 
most important to couples, the ones 
that may cause arguments into silly 
little conversations that seem mun-
dane. Gottman’s research continued 
to say that those couples who stayed 
together were more likely to indulge 
in their partner’s “bids” or attempts 
at getting the other person’s atten-
tion with some seemingly insignifi-
cant occurrence, such as wanting 
to talk about something funny that 
happened at work that day. In Gott-
man’s research, those couples who 
listened and recognized the need 
for this simple form of communica-
tion were able to make their partner 
feel heard and emotionally fulfilled. 
Those couples who split up were 
less likely to humor their partner 
and disrupt their own lives to dis-
cuss these kinds of topics.

Proper communication for both 

important and unimportant topics 
has become a sort of lost art in rela-
tionships. People either do not know 
how to communicate effectively or 
are not willing to put in the energy to 
do so, and the institution of marriage 
has suffered for it.

I haven’t been a conservative 

forever. Until my junior year of 
high school, I considered myself an 
unavowed liberal. I won’t bore you 
with the entire story, but several 
factors contributed to me coming 
to the realization that I harbored 
many conservative thoughts — not 
an absolute ideology, however.

Not surprisingly, I started to 

identify with the Republican Party 
— it seemed like the logical deci-
sion. I am now a proud member of 
the College Republicans here at 
the University — but of my party 
at large, I cannot express the same 
degree of pride.

As I survey the current presiden-

tial primary battle, my choices have 
been narrowed down to the lesser 
of many evils. Call me a “slave to the 
establishment” or not a “true con-
servative” — frankly, I don’t care. I 
am not one to shy away from saying 
I adhere to some liberal ideas along 
with my conservatism.

What!? A member of a political 

party who doesn’t agree entirely with 
their party’s platform? Such horror!

Therefore, I’m sure you can 

understand that with the advent 
of the likes of Donald Trump, Ted 
Cruz and the other bloviating insti-
gators who occupy Republican 
debate stages, I am filled with utter 
disgust at the state of our party. Not 
only is it a detriment to moderates 
like myself to have bigoted bombas-
tic individuals holding the banner 
of the GOP, but it moves our nation 
further along a partisan divide that 
seemingly increases day by day.

However, I want to focus on 

Trump as the true symbol of my 
current distaste.

Yes, I know, he is discussed 

incessantly ad nauseam. But it isn’t 
the man I concern myself with, it’s 
what he epitomizes.

The prospect of Trump as the 

Republican nominee is becoming 
increasingly viable — he was poll-
ing at 41 percent in the latest GOP 
primary poll. This means several 
things, but perhaps the most strik-

ing is this: Apparently, if you asked 
about two-fifths of GOP voters, 
they would consciously cast a ballot 
for a candidate who promoted a pol-
icy banning an entire religion from 
entering the nation, who suggested 
we deport 11 million illegal indi-
viduals “humanely,” who doesn’t 
have a shred of political experience, 
who attributed global warming to a 
Chinese hoax to somehow gain an 
economic advantage over the Unit-
ed States and who cannot answer 

basic questions regarding foreign 
or domestic policy.

You really can’t make this stuff up.
It is easy to pry for sympathy 

from those who aren’t Republicans, 
as Peter Wehner recently did. Bear 
in mind, Wehner worked for the 
previous three Republican admin-
istrations, and now he is clamoring 
to vent his frustrations in arguably 
the nation’s most liberal main-
stream newspaper.

As I read the comments section of 

that article, almost every single state-
ment reflected the same principle: 
Sorry, GOP, but this one’s on you.

Unfortunately, they are spot on.
After years of unrelenting nay-

saying — at times, clear racism 
— a lack of basic knowledge about 
reproductive health, along with 
just plain ignorance about women 
and the election of congressmen 
who disrupt a State of the Union 

address with exclamations of “you 
lie!” — just to name a few — we have 
formulated a party that would not 
only accept the likes of Trump as 
our standard-bearer, but fervently 
support him.

As Wehner points out, there was 

a time when the GOP stood for con-
servative ideals, but wasn’t catering 
to prejudicial remarks or proposals. 
There was even an era when work-
ing with Democrats on legislation 
wasn’t taboo. I find it appalling 
that Marco Rubio is consistently 
attacked by his fellow candidates 
for being a member of the biparti-
san coalition dubbed the “Gang of 
Eight” that tried to pass compre-
hensive immigration reform just 
a few years ago. Granted, many 
of these arguments are focused 
on the bill’s actual substance, but 
what irks me is the reality that 
Republicans charge at Rubio simply 
because he attempted to formulate 
policy in tandem with Democrats.

There are times when I ponder 

the idiom “you are your own worst 
enemy.” Well, my fellow Republi-
cans, this may be a time to discuss 
that idea amongst ourselves.

If Trump or Cruz becomes the 

nominee, I’m not sure who I will 
vote for, if anyone at all. Just like 
Wehner, I believe this could be a 
watershed moment for the GOP — a 
point at which center-right individ-
uals devoted to bettering the world 
along with our Democratic coun-
terparts split with angry, mob-like 
“Republicans” who would rather 
see Muslims banned from the 
greatest nation on Earth than solv-
ing, as a united citizenry, the issues 
that grip our country.

Nobody can predict the future, but 

we can look to the past for possible 
answers. We now know one thing 
for certain: We, the GOP, created the 
mess we are in. Now it’s up to us to 
either fix it or let the party run its 
inevitable course toward failure. 

What we created

I am now a proud 

member of the College 

Republicans here at 
the University — but 
of my party at large, 
I cannot express the 
same degree of pride.

The mantra that the

more than a fraudulent 

explanation to plug 

holes in a state budget

People have

‘M’ looks for season sweep

By BRAD WHIPPLE

Daily Sports Editor

It is said lightning never strikes 

twice in the same place, and that 
could spell trouble for the Michigan 
women’s basketball team.

Thursday, 

the Wolverines 
(3-5 Big Ten, 
11-8 overall) will 
face Iowa for 
the second time 
this 
season. 

Both teams left 
off two weeks 
ago in dramatic 
fashion, 
when 

Michigan 
completed 
a 
stunning 

17-point 
comeback 
against 
the 

Hawkeyes in Crisler Center.

Now, the Wolverines are hoping 

to earn their first season sweep of 
Iowa since the 2009-10 season. But 
on the road, comebacks are much 
harder to muster.

“If you get in a hole that deep 

on the road, it’s gonna be tough 
to come back,” said Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico. “Playing 
at Iowa, they always have great 
crowds, and they’ll have a great 
atmosphere, so that’ll be a little 
bit challenging.”

A struggling Michigan defense 

won’t make it any easier. Though 
the Wolverines are scoring 81.5 
points per game, good for eighth 
nationally and third in the Big 
Ten, offense can’t win games 
alone. Michigan is 10-2 when 
scoring 80 points or more, but its 
two losses have come in its most 
recent games.

Sunday 
against 
Nebraska, 

Michigan gave up 93 points and 

allowed the Cornhuskers to take 
a 21-6 lead just five minutes into 
the game.

The 
game 
prior, 
the 

Wolverines lost to No. 7 Ohio 
State by just four points after 
allowing four Buckeyes to reach 
double digits in scoring.

“We really do have to get 

better defensively,” Barnes Arico 
said. “We have some really 
great 
offensive-minded 
kids, 

but none that really — maybe 
Siera Thompson, maybe Danielle 
Williams — that want to defend. 
Other than that, they want the ball 
in their hands and want to score. 

“We have to get them to 

believe that playing defense is 
just as important to our program 
as playing offense. For us to 
be successful, we need some 
defensive stoppers and defensive-
minded people.”

Considering 
that 
the 

Wolverines were barely averaging 
60 points in Barnes Arico’s first 
year at the helm, scoring 80 points 
is not necessarily a bad thing. But 
Michigan will need to make a 
similar improvement on defense 
to make the NCAA Tournament.

According to Barnes Arico, 

it’s the younger kids who “don’t 
really understand defense yet” — 
a sentiment she shared with men’s 
basketball coach John Beilein. 
Freshman center Hallie Thome, 
for instance, scored a game-high 
24 points against Nebraska on 
Sunday, but fouled out of the 
game in the fourth quarter.

Thome is a major piece of the 

Wolverines’ 
lineup, 
especially 

under the glass, and without her, 
senior guard Madison Ristovski 
had to take on the Cornhuskers’ 
bigs in the paint. Considering 
Ristovski is 5-foot-10, it was a 
defensive mismatch. 

To work out some of the 

defensive kinks, Michigan has 
placed a large emphasis on it at 
practice throughout the week. 
Heading into Thursday, the 
Wolverines have the advantage 
of already playing Iowa once 
this season.

“It’s 
nice 
having 
an 

opportunity to go back and watch 
us play against them and see 
where we really need to improve 
for the next game,” Barnes Arico 
said. “Iowa’s a great team. They 
were off to a tremendous start, 
and then they hit a little bit of a 
bump in the road. I think that’s 
what our conference has kind of 
been all year long — everybody’s 
beating everybody.

“(Iowa’s) on a little bit of a skid.”
With two straight losses, the 

Wolverines are in similar danger. 
They’ll need to steal a win on the 
road to break out of it.

ICE HOCKEY
Michigan set for 
pivotal weekend

Wolverines take on 
No. 15 Penn State in 
State College, then 
in New York City

By JASON RUBINSTEIN

Daily Sports Writer

Michigan’s top line is the best 

in the country. That could seem 
like a sweeping statement, but 
the stats tell the 
whole story.

In 
the 
10 

games 
that 

juniors 
Tyler 

Motte and JT 
Compher 
and 

freshman Kyle 
Connor 
have 

skated 
as 
a 

trio, they have 
accumulated 64 
points.

“You 
can’t 

create 
those 

things,” 
said 

Michigan coach 
Red Berenson. “It’s special.”

No team has shown the ability 

to stop the three forwards 
together so far, but this weekend 
will 
be 
the 
toughest 
test. 

Thursday night, No. 6 Michigan 
will travel to 
No. 
15 
Penn 

State to play 
one game, and 
both 
teams 

will 
head 

to 
Madison 

Square Garden 
in New York 
City 
two 

days 
later 

for a second 
matchup.

In previous seasons, Penn State 

has had the Wolverines’ number. 
Two years ago, the Nittany Lions 
ended Michigan’s season in the 
Big Ten Tournament, as the 
Wolverines needed to beat them 
only in that game to advance to 
the NCAA Tournament.

Last season, Penn State beat 

Michigan three out of the four 
times they played, including a 
road sweep at the Pegula Ice 
Arena — one of the toughest 
venues in the country with its 
nightly sellouts, committed fans 
and vertical bleachers that seem 
to be on top of the ice.

“Definitely a rink we want to 

keep quiet,” said senior forward 
Justin Selman.

Look 
for 
Michigan’s 
first 

line to do just that. With Motte 
and Compher being two of the 
Wolverines’ 
hardest-working 

players, and Connor perhaps the 
their most skilled player, no line 
has found an answer for them.

“It’s 
worked 
well 
with 

Connor’s 
skill, 
his 
ability 

to 
make 
plays 
and 
finish 

opportunities,” 
Motte 
said. 

“JT’s grinding ability — he’s a 
good two-way center man — 
helps a lot in the D-zone and on 
faceoffs. (Compher’s) ability to 
make plays is unbelievable, and 
I just try to give those guys the 
puck, and try to put away my 
opportunities when I get them.”

The trio is the biggest reason 

for 
Michigan’s 
astounding, 

nation-leading 4.86 goals per 
game. However, that offense can 
only take a team so far when the 
same team ranks 44th in team 
defense, surrendering 3.10 goals 
per game.

For this reason, Berenson 

has emphasized team defense 
in the weeks leading up to this 
weekend. The Wolverines have 
prioritized clearing pucks out the 
zone and limiting any rebound 
chances — something Ohio State 
capitalized on a couple of weeks 

ago. 
Selman 

said the team 
knows 
its 

goaltending 
can handle the 
initial shot. It’s 
the team’s job 
to make sure 
there isn’t a 
second.

Michigan 

will 
feature 

a bit of a different lineup this 
weekend — sophomore forward 
Dexter 
Dancs 
is 
suspended 

for 
Thursday’s 
game, 
while 

sophomore defenseman Cutler 
Martin is suspended for the 
weekend. 
Freshman 
center 

Cooper Marody will also be 
out this weekend due to illness, 
meaning junior forward Max 
Shuart will likely slot up from his 
fourth-line role to the third-line 
center position.

Regardless, the Wolverines 

know what’s at stake this 
weekend. With their biggest 
test to date and a depleted 
lineup, look for the first line to 
lead the charge.

were, 
when 
Michigan 
was 

playing football, we stopped 
whatever we were doing, and we 
were watching,” the source said. 
“During some of (Connecticut’s) 
football games, when he was 
focused on our game, he would 
have 
the 
Michigan 
game 

recorded at his home. Nobody 
was allowed to tell him what the 
final score was.”

Among Manuel’s more notable 

achievements at Connecticut is 
the men’s basketball program’s 
remarkable 
resurrection 

following 
a 
postseason 
ban 

issued by the NCAA in 2012 for a 
low academic progress rate.

“It didn’t take Warde long to 

not only fix the APR but bring 
it to a perfect 1,000,” the source 
said. “The guy is a no-nonsense 
guy. He knows what needs to be 
done, and he 
gets it done.”

Despite his 

impressive 
resume, 
Manuel 
still 

inherits 
a 

high bar from 
Hackett. 
Since 
assuming 
the position, 
Hackett hired 
Harbaugh in December 2014, 
inked a record-setting apparel 
contract with Nike in July and 
extended 
men’s 
basketball 

coach John Beilein to a contract 
through the 2020-21 season in 
November.

Manuel’s hiring bucks a recent 

trend of hiring former corporate 
executives 
to 
run 
athletic 

departments. Former Michigan 

athletic director Bill Martin, 
who held the post from 2001 to 
2010, founded First Martin Corp. 
in 1968 and remains chairman of 
the Bank of Ann Arbor. Brandon 
was the CEO at Domino’s Pizza 
before he replaced Martin.

Manuel, 47, has no corporate 

experience, but he has built an 
impressive resume in athletics. 
He previously served as an 
assistant 
athletic 
director 
at 

Michigan under Tom Goss and 
then Bill Martin. He also served 
as the athletic director at the 
University of Buffalo from 2005 
to 2012.

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel 
told 
reporters 
in 
a 

December 
teleconference 
that 

corporate experience, while a 
potential plus, was far from critical.

“I’m looking for the best 

person for the job,” Schlissel said. 
“It is a $151-million enterprise. 
It’s 
a 
complex 
enterprise 

that requires somebody with 

business, 
accounting 
and 
leadership 
skills 
and 

experience. … 
The 
bottom 

line is we’re 
going to hire 
a spectacular 
person.” 

Many 

with ties to 

Connecticut’s program had long 
feared that Manuel would return 
to his alma mater, the source 
said, but his timeline for doing so 
was uncertain.

“He is an incredibly capable 

administrator, but more than 
that, he understands people,” the 
source said, lamenting Manuel’s 
departure. 
“He’s 
a 
freakin’ 

incredible guy — it sucks to be us.”

Wolverines fend off Rutgers, 68-57

Michigan beats 
another sluggish 

start to earn win at 

Crisler Center

By JACOB GASE

Daily Sports Editor

After eight and a half seasons 

coaching in the Big Ten, Michigan 
men’s basketball coach John 
Beilein has learned not to take 
any 
game 

for granted.

When 

Minnesota 
and its winless Big Ten record 
came into Crisler Center last 
week 
and 
the 
Wolverines 

struggled to secure a slim five-
point victory, Beilein merely 
shrugged. He knows that in this 
conference, any team can beat 
him on any given night.

So when Rutgers came to Ann 

Arbor seeking its first Big Ten win 
Wednesday night, Beilein knew 
better than to look past it. Sure 
enough, Michigan started slow 
again — but this time, it woke up 
more quickly.

Despite missing their first five 

shots and not taking the lead until 
late in the first half, the Wolverines 
(6-2 Big Ten, 16-5 overall) took 
over the game with a 12-0 run in 
the first frame and cruised to a 
68-57 victory. In contrast to the 
win over the Golden Gophers — in 
which junior forward Zak Irvin 
and junior guard Derrick Walton 
Jr. almost single-handedly took 
over — multiple Michigan players 
stepped up their play in the 
winning effort.

Redshirt 
sophomore 
guard 

Duncan Robinson led the way 
with 18 points on four 3-pointers, 
sophomore 
guard 
Aubrey 

Dawkins spurred the first-half 
offensive resurgence and finished 
with 11 points, and Irvin flirted 
with a triple-double with a final 
line of eight points, 12 rebounds 

and eight assists.

Though 
the 
Wolverines 

finished with four double-digit 
scorers, things didn’t look so easy 
in the beginning. In fact, Beilein 
had a bad feeling before the game 
even started — just minutes before 
the game, his scouting report, 
which was between four and five 
pages, went missing.

“I always religiously go over it 

one more time, and I couldn’t find 
it,” Beilein said. “That was a bad 
omen to start, because after 1,100 
games, I have the same ritual, and 
I couldn’t find it.”

That bad luck quickly spread 

to the court, where Michigan 
shot just 25 percent (including 
1-for-6 from 3-point range) in 
the first 12 minutes of the game. 
The Wolverines managed to 
stay in the game thanks to nine 
first-half Rutgers turnovers — 
including one Scarlet Knight 
falling out of bounds with the 
ball and another throwing a pass 
into the first row of courtside 
seats near the basket.

With Rutgers (0-8, 6-15) clinging 

to a 16-12 lead at the penultimate 

first-half media timeout, Dawkins 
— who dropped a career-high 31 
points against Rutgers at Crisler 
Center last season — was the one 
to manufacture that energy. After 
Dawkins cut into the lead with 
a 3-pointer and a two-handed 
slam dunk, junior forward Mark 
Donnal blocked a shot and later 
found Dawkins for a wide-open 
3 on the other end for his eighth 
straight point to tie the game at 20.

Dawkins’ spark propelled the 

Wolverines to a 12-0 run, with 
Irvin and Robinson both hitting 
3-pointers to give Michigan a 
seven-point lead at the half.

Walton 
hit 
two 
straight 

3-pointers soon after the break to 
push the lead to 12, but Rutgers 
marched right back with a 7-0 
run. The teams traded offense for 
the next several minutes before 
sophomore forward Ricky Doyle 
hit two straight layups, Dawkins 
and Robinson nailed two more 
triples and Walton converted 
three straight free throws to 
extend the lead to a game-high 
14 points — a deficit the Scarlet 
Knights couldn’t erase.

Dawkins comes off 

bench to deliver 

spark, put Michigan 

in front for good

By SIMON KAUFMAN

After 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball team came out flat 
against an unheralded Minnesota 
team last week, Crisler Center 
looked 
like 
it 
might 
been 

experiencing déjà vu Wednesday 
night as the Wolverines hosted 
Rutgers — a team still looking for 
its first conference win.

In the first half, Michigan (6-2 

Big Ten, 16-5 overall) did its best 
to allow the Scarlet Knights (0-8, 
6-15) to forget they were riding 
a seven-game losing streak into 
Ann Arbor — including five losses 
by more than 20 points.

The Wolverines started the 

game shooting 5-for-20 from the 
field and trailed the Big Ten’s 
second-worst team 16-12 with 

eight minutes left in the first half.

Enter Aubrey Dawkins.
After coming off the bench 

with just under 12 minutes left in 
the frame, the sophomore forward 
wasted little time in making his 
presence felt.

Following a string of three 

straight misses from junior guard 
Derrick Walton Jr., Dawkins hit 
on his first try, knocking down a 
3-point attempt from the corner.

Thirty seconds later, Dawkins 

used a pick to lose his man at the 
top of the key. He cut toward the 
hoop and met eyes with Walton, 
who had the ball just beyond 
the arc. Walton threw a bullet 
to Dawkins, and the 6-foot-6 
sophomore caught it and threw 
down a dunk, swinging his legs 
beneath him for a split second in 
‘How ya like me now?’ fashion.

Less than a minute later, after 

junior forward Mark Donnal 
blocked a Rutgers shot attempt on 
one end, it was Dawkins again on 
the other end, hitting another 3 to 
tie the game at 20.

Two minutes. Three shots. 

Nine points.

Michigan took the lead on its 

next possession and never looked 
back, ultimately picking up a 
68-57 win.

“(I’m) just trying to provide 

energy in whatever way I can,” 
Dawkins said. “If it’s making 
shots, if it’s rebounding, if it’s 
making the right pass — whatever 
it is — just trying to give the game 
a different kind of vibe, a different 
energy. That’s what I pride my 
game on right now, just trying to 
make something happen.”

Dawkins’ 
electric 
entrance 

provided the spark Michigan 
needed to flip the switch. After 
missing his first three tries from 
deep, junior forward Zak Irvin 
hit from beyond the arc with just 
more than four minutes left and 
hit two free throws late to salvage 
an otherwise forgetful first half 
and help send the Wolverines into 
the locker room with a 34-27 lead.

In the second half, Dawkins 

came close to changing the energy 
in a big way again. With Michigan 
up 
nine, 
Dawkins 
streaked 

through the paint after catching 
a Walton pass from the baseline. 
Two Rutgers players split as 
Dawkins charged toward the 
basket, elevated and attempted 
to throw down a one-handed, 
jaw-dropping dunk. But the ball 
caught too much of the back of the 
rim and ricocheted past half court 
in the opposite direction.

“I jumped too far,” Dawkins 

said of the dunk. “I thought the 
guy in the paint was going to 
jump, but he didn’t jump, so I 
was expecting the contact, but 
it wasn’t there, and I was like, 
‘Wow, I’m too far away so now I 
can’t land it, so I just gotta throw 
it and hope it goes through.’ Blake 
Griffin-esque. But it didn’t go in.”

Despite the blooper-reel miss, 

he didn’t hesitate to fire from the 
corner when he had an open look 
on the next trip down the court, 
hitting his third 3 of the night.

Dawkins finished 4-for-6 from 

the field for 11 points — the margin 
of Michigan’s win.

LIFE and DEATH in ANN ARBOR

Muehlig, Ann 
Arbor’s funeral 
home since 1852

By MATT GALLATIN 

Daily Arts Writer

In youthful Ann Arbor, a city 

known by some as “the best col-
lege town in America,” death can 
be a foreign language. As much 
as smoking commercials and 
PSAs attempt to remind us of our 
mortality, the widespread youth-
ful delusion of invincibility can 
be hard to shake for a population 
that has little experience to the 
contrary. Students cross the street 
without looking both ways, drink 
more than they probably should, 
smoke cigarettes in the name of 
hipsterdom and yet, more often 
than not, still see the light of day 
tomorrow.

But death is a very real part of 

life in the ostensibly invincible 
Ann Arbor. We recently mourn-
ed the death of Chad Carr, the 
5-year-old son of former Univer-
sity quarterback Jason Carr and 
the grandson of former University 
football coach Lloyd Carr. Last 
July, a 21-year-old student fell 
to his death after climbing onto 
the glass ceiling covering Nickels 
Arcade. And of course, as with 
any city, there are people who pass 
every day.

For transient young students 

— for young people in general — 
it’s easy to absorb these deaths as 
one would anything else on the 
daily news cycle. When murders 
in Chicago are treated with more 
stoicism and banality than the 
morning traffic report, it becomes 
hard to see the emotion in death. 
For those who aren’t close to the 
individuals who pass away on TV, 
there likely isn’t a lasting impact 
from these tragedies. Loss is not a 
part of the local young adult ver-
nacular.

For a few, however, death and 

grieving are their livelihood.

Muehlig Funeral Chapel is the 

only funeral home within the city 
limits of Ann Arbor. Founded by 
Florian Muehlig in 1852, it is the 
oldest funeral home in the state of 
Michigan, originating in an upper 
floor office along Main Street and 
eventually moving into its current 
building on South Fourth Avenue 
in 1928. Once a private hospital, 
the history of Muehlig Funeral 
Chapel is the history of Ann Arbor. 

Thomas Jensen, director of the 

Muehlig home, has worked in the 
field for the last 34 years. While 
many enter the profession because 
of family ties, Jensen explained 
in an interview with The Michi-
gan Daily that he entered the field 
“totally by accident.”

“Over a summer during high 

school I got a part time job at the 
local funeral home washing cars, 
working at ceremonies, answer-
ing the phone and such,” Jensen 
said. “I went to college, and in my 
third year I decided that this (the 
funeral businesses) was what I 
wanted to do.”

As a student at Wayne State 

University in Detroit, Jensen con-
tinued working at funeral homes, 
and lived in one nearby during 
his later college years. Aside from 
the social strain that comes with 
living in a funeral home, Jensen 
explained that it was little differ-
ent than living in your average 
apartment.

“It’s hard to get your friends to 

come over,” Jensen said. “And for-
get about girls, I didn’t even try.”

According to Jensen, social 

stigmas are common for funeral 
directors. With the prominence 
of TV shows like HBO’s “Six 
Feet Under” and fantasized 
horror films like “After.Life,” 
there’s a tendency to focus on 
the morbid and tantalizing, 

regardless of accuracy.

“People are very intrigued by it 

(the funeral profession),” he said. 
“There’s two ways it goes if you’re 
on an airplane. They’ll say some-
thing like ‘I work in accounting,’ 
and I respond with ‘I’m a funeral 
director.’ Either they’re not going 
to say another word to you, or 
they’re never going to shut up. 
People have a curiosity of what 
goes on. They focus more on the 
technical, backroom things that 
aren’t actually as scary or creepy 
as people think they are.”

“There is a technical, medical 

part to the job,” he added. “It’s 
an important part, but it’s a really 
small part. It’s not the majority of 
our time.”

Rather, Jensen said, a lot of time 

is spent helping families. “For the 
first few weeks we’re getting them 
through the stages so they can 
move on. We’re not grief coun-
selors, but we educate people on 
what to expect, what they might 
go through emotionally.”

It’s this, not the cadavers, that 

drew Jensen to the business.

With his intimate place within 

the Ann Arbor community, Jen-
sen offers a unique perspective on 
both our ever-changing modern 
society and the lives of Ann Arbor 
residents. Whereas the funeral 
ceremonies that Jensen officiated 
when he began his career over 30 
years ago were often religious, 
traditional and perhaps cookie-
cutter, today’s ceremonies are 
remarkably personal.

“Now, people are telling us 

what they want, and it’s our job to 
make it happen,” he said. “We’ve 
had people bring in motorcycles 
and put them up with the casket. 
We’ve had them bring old cars in 
and park them outside. We’ve had 
them bring boats and park them 
outside. We had a gentleman who 
had participated in the Mackinac 
Races for over 30 years, and they 
had all his flags from all his races 
all the way around the room, with 
pictures of his boat everywhere.”

And, because this is Ann Arbor, 

pride for the University finds its 
way into the most intimate part 
of a person’s life. Funerals are 
not to be held in Ann Arbor when 
there is a football game. Families 
hang the University flag over their 
loved ones, and often request for 
the home to be decorated in maize 
and blue for the service. Some 
even manage to incorporate the 
Big House into their commemora-
tion: “It’s not unusual for people 
to request we drive past the sta-
dium,” Jensen said.

But with emotions running 

high, funeral ceremonies are not 
always flowered with family unity. 
Jensen said everyone handles loss 
individually, but often one fam-
ily member’s idea of how to com-
memorate a loved one differs from 
another’s. In some families this 
leads to passive aggressiveness, 
though in others it can be much 
more overt.

“We’ve had fist fights, we’ve 

had yelling, we’ve had the 
police show up,” Jensen recalls, 
noting a particular quarrel over 
a seemingly innocuous portion 
of a ceremony

“With one family, there were 

two daughters arguing over flow-
ers, and they were throwing them 
at each other,” he said. “Not just 
the flowers, but the vases. So 
sometimes you’ve got to step in 
and separate that.”

Beyond stepping into physi-

cal altercations, funeral directors 
have the daunting task of handling 
the emotional weight of other’s 
grief on such a consistent basis. 
Jensen said there is no doubt that 
the job is draining. Indeed, there is 
an element of separation that the 
funeral director must have.

“You have to deal with that 

(loss),” he said. “But I tell people, 
not that we don’t have feelings 

or don’t feel for them, but we’re 
not emotionally connected to the 
people who pass like those who 
come for our services are. They’re 
paying us a lot of money, and 
they’re not paying us to cry with 
them. Not that we don’t do that, 
but that’s not what we’re here 
for them to do. We’re just here to 
help them any way we can, to help 
them get through their grief, so 
that they can hopefully move on.”

Jensen 
explained 
that 
the 

most difficult part of the job is — 
perhaps surprisingly — the long 
hours.

“For me personally, the families 

always come first,” he said. “I’ve 
missed a lot of my family things.”

He added that with modern 

technology, it’s become almost 
impossible to truly remove your-
self from the job. But, as he points 
out, that is little different than 
most careers, and the satisfaction 
that he receives from helping a 
family through the process of loss 
is rewarding enough to make the 
profession worth it: “I love what I 
do,” he said. 

For a profession so rooted in 

death, Jensen says that his job 
gives him an important perspec-
tive not just on loss, but on life.

“We just had a 17-month-old 

yesterday whose parents are from 
Alaska,” he said. “They came down 
here just for U of M, with their 
son, and he didn’t survive the sur-
gery. Life’s not so bad compared to 
all the people I’ve worked with. It 
keeps things in perspective that 
way, not to sweat the small stuff.”

But when it comes to the big 

stuff, Jensen says that he isn’t 
worried.

“I don’t want to die yet, but if I 

die tomorrow, I’m OK with that,” 
he said.

For Jensen, faith is an impor-

tant element in facing any fear of 
passing.

“It (the job) affects my belief in 

life after this; I hope, so yeah, it 
affects a lot,” he said. “Again, treat 
the body as just a vessel. The soul 
is then going to live on.”

Last October, a close friend of 

mine died in a drunk driving acci-
dent. I won’t lie and say that this 
gave me some kind of epiphany 
about valuing my own life. Every-
thing didn’t suddenly become 
clear. I didn’t “see the light.” 
Rather, I drank to blackout the fol-
lowing weekend and missed the 
service. A moral low-point? Prob-
ably. For me then, and likely still, 
it’s easier to embrace the igno-
rance of death as an abstract.

I offer this not for sympathy, 

but to recognize the shortcom-
ings of one-size-fits-all clichés. 
We’re constantly assailed with 
the importance of each day of our 
lives. We’re supposed to accept 
that we can be gone at any minute, 
and therefore need to enjoy every 
moment of our days here. “Thank 
God it wasn’t us,” people say.

But if each day could be our 

last, should we attach such grav-
ity when a day doesn’t fit the bill 
for “best day ever?” The idea that 
we can be extinguished like a 
candle isn’t an enjoyable concept. 
It seems in ignorance there is far 
more bliss.

Jensen’s proximity with death 

reminds him, and us, that we 
shouldn’t sweat the small stuff. 
To me, this extends to the things 
we cannot change. I can’t change 
that someone texting down I-94 
could leave me, or anyone, six 
feet under. But what good is 
there for it to weigh on myself, 
or anyone else? People enter 
funeral homes each day. Wor-
rying about when we’ll go can’t 
change that. For me, embracing 
each day doesn’t come from the 
fear the it could be the last, but 
because so far it isn’t. 

“It’s going to be OK,” Jensen 

says. If a funeral director can 
believe this, we sure as hell can.

“Ann Arbor? What a great col-

lege town.”

How many times have we all 

heard that? No doubt, it’s true. 
Ann Arbor is populated with an 
incredible variety of people; this 
city is built on passion, intellect 
and drive.

Recently I realized that the 

more time I spend in AA, the 
more I forget that. Outside of 
this town, it’s easy to see how 
it stands out. There is a type of 
energy at school you can’t find 
anywhere else. When I speak 
to alumni about Ann Arbor, the 
conversations are endless: Where 
do you go to eat? What shows 
have you seen? Sports, events, 
classes — everything. We will all 
be at the point when we eventu-
ally leave this city, (some never 
do, but you might) and appreciate 
all these elements that composed 
what we called home.

With two years almost com-

pleted, and only two to go, I 
realize there is potential to miss 
the point. I feel like we’re so 
immersed in it — whether that it 
is classes, clubs or relationships 
— it’s hard to really appreciate 
the vastness of this place and 
recognize all the opportunities 
here.

There are thousands of stu-

dents in this city studying so 
many different subjects, with so 
many different talents and pas-

sions. It’s absolutely crucial we 
use that towards something. I 
feel like I get stuck in this rou-
tine (understandably so) of class-
es, clubs, friends, résumé, career 
… the list goes on. It takes some-
thing extra to get myself out of 
this mindset and recognize that 
I, along with many others, could 
be missing exactly what Ann 
Arbor asks us to find. Find our 
passion, yes. But ultimately, find 
its purpose.

I came across a video the 

other day posted by C.S. Mott 
Children’s Hospital with SMTD 
Senior Christina Maxwell sing-
ing to children in the hospital. 
She decided to use her talent and 
passion for performing to bright-
en the day of children.

I realized then — that is exact-

ly what we should be doing here.

You could see this forced 

reflection as clichéd, or maybe 
you think you’re already doing 
this. This video made me ques-
tion if I really am.

Ann Arbor hands you the 

opportunity to find what you 
love, but often we see that as 
something applied to a career 
and not everyday occurrences. 
We should use what we’re learn-
ing, seeing and experiencing 
not only toward future goals, 
but toward what’s in front of us. 
Simply, to do something beyond 
ourselves.

Maxwell’s Friday visits to the 

hospital illustrate exactly what 
I’m talking about. It’s so easy to 

get fixated on everything we are 
committed to, and in turn lose 
moments we don’t even realize 
we had. We have a rare oppor-
tunity to be in a place that offers 
the ability to simultaneously 
learn and give. 

“What performing is about is 

that connection,” Maxwell said. 
“It’s about sharing that gift of 
joy, that give of love, that gift of 
happiness.”

The kids at Mott are so excited 

and happy by these Friday visits, 
and the musical theatre students 
who perform are simply doing 
what they love. This service isn’t 
some résumé booster, or way to 
showcase talent. It’s sharing a 
gift with those who need a little 
more joy.

I’m not telling you to drasti-

cally change your schedules to 
accommodate this idea. I am, 
however, suggesting you start 
recognizing the moments that 
are in front of you to give back. 
The gratification from those 
efforts is inexpressibly glorious, 
whether you are the one doing it 
or witnessing it.

Maxwell admitted that her 

Friday visits provide the best 
work she will ever do.

So Ann Arbor, the great col-

lege town, what else do you have 
to offer?

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

 “Give me the landscape of 

the moon,” Wolfmother’s lead 
singer, Andrew Stockdale, prob-
ably said. 
“Yes, give 
me the land-
scape of the 
moon and 
then give me 
a couple dif-
ferent outfit 
options. Give me a full-body 
cape to wear, but also give me a 
stereotypical ‘cool hipster rock 
god’ outfit to wear as well so 
that I can still have the option 
of maybe getting laid.” 

“We’ll work with the Star 

Wars hype that the world is 
still coasting on,” Stockdale 
said to his band. “Put the resi-
dent ‘hot girl’ in the video in 
something that the sci-fi nerds 
can masturbate to later. But 
let’s leave the viewer with an 
impression, however so small, 
that we understand and appre-
ciate feminism. So make sure 
you give her a sword of some 
sort to emphasize that under-
lying ‘strong female role’ that 
we hope to emulate.” 

And so the Princess Leia 

wannabe runs around the 
galaxy, lazily slashing into 
the sides of men in alligator 
masks. She is destroying them 
before she has to face the dark 

Galactic warlord who, armed 
with bushy goatee, looks like 
the opposite of a Sith lord. He 
looks like your neighbor down 
the street who waters his lawn 
too much. 

It’s so wildly entertaining in 

its simplicity, and it’s so dumb 
that it has done something 
right. So the Aussie band is 
either secured tightly to the 
Earth, or they are far, far away 
on the moon of their minds. 
With this music video, they are 
either brilliant or insane. 

With the inescapable notes 

of sexism and tinges of self-
obsession aside, Wolfmother’s 
newest music video for “Victo-

rious” off of their recent album 
Gypsy Caravan is an homage 
to the bad sci-fi movies of the 
1970s and ‘80s. The music vid-
eo’s director, Brother Willis, 
describes this tongue-in-cheek 
video as “a lost space movie” 
that is mysteriously found and 
popped into a VCR somewhere. 
It’s a groovy concept that 
manifests itself into an enter-
taining video. 

But the greatest reveal of the 

Wolfmother video? You can’t 
hide a bad, Muse-wannabe 
song behind the strangeness of 
a music video.

COVER STORY

SINGLE REVIEW

 Macklemore is a rapper 

who, in the past, has released 
songs about penises and thrift 
shop cloth-
ing. He 
has been 
dismissed 
as phony, ille-
gitimate and 
a sellout.

Regardless 

of Mackl-
emore’s 
reputation, 
he’s always 
been socially conscious. He first 
rapped about racial inequality in 
2005 on “White Privilege.” Now 
he’s back with “White Privilege 
II,” the second single from his 
upcoming album This Unruly 
Mess I’ve Made.

At times, Macklemore’s mes-

sage is rambling and repetitive. 
Choosing to make a song about 
such a culturally relevant issue 
is great, but the song is eight 
minutes and 45 seconds and the 
instrumentals are all over the 

place. The somewhat discom-
bobulated political statement is 
interspersed with soulful sam-
ples/dialogue and vocals from 
Jamila Woods, all complemented 
by typically piano-heavy produc-
tion from Ryan Lewis. 

Despite the blemishes, Mackl-

emore still has thoughtful com-
mentary. He acknowledges the 
cultural appropriation some 
might see in his music, saying, 
“You’ve taken the drums and 
the accent you rapped in / Your 
brand of hip hop it’s so fascist 
and backwards / That Grand-

master Flash’d go slap it, you bas-
tard,” and taking it a step further 
by reiterating his genuine inter-
est in making racial progress.

At best, he’s using his platform 

to bring more light to an impor-
tant social issue. At worst, he’s 
using such a serious matter to 
add to his success/street credit as 
a social activist and entertainer.

What results from his efforts 

may not be a well-executed 
attempt, but it is an attempt. And 
in times like these, in this social 
climate, that’s worth something.

RUBY WALLAU/Daily

The Ann Arbor Zen Buddhist Temple offers placid sanctuary to “everyone nice.”

Ann Arbor Buddhist 

Temple a haven of 

calm energy. 

By MADELEINE GAUDIN 

Daily Arts Writer

Nestled between a defunct bike 

shop and a vacuum store, the Ann 
Arbor Zen Buddhist Temple is 
easy to notice and just as easy to 
miss. The bright yellow Victorian 
and the adjacent brick building 
don’t scream “temple.” But once 
on the other side of the stone wall, 
the pair of buildings, connected 
by a small garden, feel very much 
like a sacred space. There’s a 
tremendous calm energy hanging 
in the air. The street noise, though 
minimal on a Sunday morning, all 
but disappears.

Once inside the temple, the 

calmness I felt in the courtyard 
is intensified exponentially. After 
passing 
through 
an 
entrance 

room, I walk into the main temple 
room in silence. It’s packed. Most 
of the mats are taken already, but 
I find one in the back and sit down. 
Trying to meditate is really hard, 
and I guess the whole trying part 
defeats the purpose of meditation. 
At first, I find it difficult to keep 
my eyes closed. Something in 
my brain keeps flicking my eyes 
open nervously. When my eyes 
are closed I can’t help worrying 
that I’m doing this wrong. Is there 
something I should be thinking 
about? And then, nothing changes 
except it gets easier — I think about 
less. Mostly, I don’t think about 
trying to keep my eyes closed.

Then, a bell rings and we begin 

chanting a prayer that’s easy to 
pick up. While we’re chanting, the 
children who attend a kid’s service 
in the yellow house next door file 
in wearing animal masks. They 
perform a play about Buddha’s 
enlightenment that’s endearing 
and extremely informative.

priest of the temple (known 
to the temple community by 
her first name, Haju), said a 
few words about meditation, 
mindfulness and strengthening 
our practices. Incredibly poised 
and gentle, Haju is the spiritual 
and community leader of the 
Ann Arbor temple. One of her 
congregants described her as “the 
North Star” of their temple. She 
greets everyone as they exit with 
a bow and introduces herself to 
any new attendees.

In a conversation later that day, 

Haju described her congregation 
as 
“an 
increasingly 
diverse 

community of people from all 
walks of life … an increasingly 
supportive community of people 
who help each other.” It is 
also an incredibly welcoming 
community. At the service I 
attended, many, like myself, were 
at the temple for the first time; a 
few were even rookie meditators 
too. But after the service, lifetime 
members and newbies conversed 
about mindfulness, meditation 
and 
the 
upcoming 
women’s 

basketball game.

The 
temple 
also 
offers 

services outside Sunday services 
like the one I attended. Haju said 
the temple “offers means for 
people to go through the various 

aspects of the life cycle, you 
know, in a spiritual way.”

They “conduct baby blessings, 

have 
marriage 
ceremonies, 

divorce ceremonies even, and 
house 
blessings 
and 
funerals 

and memorial services” to give 
members of the community means 
of 
commemorating 
spiritually 

each milestone in their lives.

The entire temple community 

has a strong focus on activism and 
community service.

“We also try to do services 

in the community so we work 
in the prisons and we help with 
hunger relief, and we do some 
fundraisers,” Haju said.

Next door, I attend a meeting 

with members of the community 
who 
focus 
on 
environmental 

consciousness. They practice a sort 
of sacred activism: activism driven 
by the teachings of mindfulness. 
The group attends conferences, 
participates in marches and goes 
on meditation retreats. In the 
meeting I attended, they discussed 
opening these retreats for non-
Buddhist member of the Ann 
Arbor community who share their 
passion for conservation.

“We do interfaith work, too 

… we try to have meetings with 
people from other religions,” Haju 
said. “We don’t think Buddhism is 
the only religion on the planet or 
the most worthy.”

Involvement in the greater Ann 

Arbor community is central to 
the temple. Practice extends far 
beyond the services.

“We say everyday life is the way; 

the way of the Buddha is everyday 
life; everyday life is the way of the 
Buddha,” Haju said. Members of 
the community agreed, saying 
their practice was “not always 
conscious.” Dog walks and grocery 
store visits alike serve as everyday 
reminders of mindfulness.

At lunch, I discuss the impact of 

the temple outside the stone walls 
with Haju and some of the temple’s 
congregants as residents. The 
great consensus is that it’s hard to 
tell the difference between their 
practice at Sunday services and in 
their daily lives.

“It’s not about being here or not 

being here,” one member said.

Others commented on the 

joy that comes with having a 
community that you can both 
take from and give to. The 
temple clearly has a strong, often 
subconscious impact in the daily 
lives of its members. In their 
jobs, classes and social lives, 
the members said “mindfulness 
follows you everywhere.”

“This is not about some kind 

of monastery that has nothing 
to do with the secular world,” 
Haju said, in reference to the 
temple’s reach within the greater 
Ann Arbor community. “It’s 
about helping people so they 
can contribute wholesomely and 
ethically and artistically … to 
community and society.”

As much as the temple helps 

its members in their lives, it 
helps them equally in their 
deaths. Death is embraced as an 
important and necessary event in 
the lifecycle.

“We do not keep death under 

cover,” Haju said. “We try to be 
really open. It’s the nature of our 
existence; there isn’t anybody 
that doesn’t die. So if we embrace 

that we die it means we have to 
embrace that we’re living, that 
we’re alive, because it makes our 
lives so precious and important 
while we have them.”

That 
acceptance 
of 
death 

can be extremely painful and 
difficult and Haju acknowledges 
that. “It feels like, ‘What can we 
do?’ ” she said.

“So, during the time before 

that they die, we just do all 
the basic things — take them 
soup and take them to hospital 
appointments and do whatever 
needs to be done,” she continued. 
“And, then talk about this end 
of life that they are approaching 
and what they what to be done 
and how they want things to be.

“Usually it’s very calming for 

the mind and so there’s a sense 
of being able to relax with the 
journey.”

They aren’t afraid to “talk 

about this end of life that they 
are approaching” because honest 
conversation can sometimes be 
more 
comforting 
than 
warm 

soup or casseroles. “Usually (this 
conversation) is very calming for 
the mind and so there’s a sense 
of being able to relax with the 
journey,” Haju said.

For those left behind in the wake 

of a death, the temple does offer 
funeral and memorial services. 
It usually includes a photo of the 
deceased on the altar surrounded 
by small items of importance to the 
person; the community meditates 
and chants to help the deceased 
with 
their 
journey. 
Services 

continue in this manner for 49 
days after their death.

“In Buddhism, we say it takes 

49 days for the essence of a person 
to find its next rightful place in the 
universe,” Haju said. Services on 
the 49th day are commemorated 
as being the day the person’s spirit 
finds a new home in the universe.

These memorial services extend 

to the four-legged members of the 
temple community as well.

“Dogs have died and people 

of course love their animals,” 
Haju said.

Because, no matter what, 

death is a really difficult and for 
many people a spiritual practice 
can help with accepting death. 
Especially when that spiritual 
practice is contained within a 
community like that of the Ann 
Arbor Zen Buddhist Temple. 
When the temple has these 
services for the sick, dying or 
deceased they are really, as Haju 
puts it, “sending compassion, 
sending strength and courage” to 
the living left behind.

The community of the Zen 

Buddhist temple manages to be 
extremely tight-knit and at the 
same time open, so new and old 
members alike feel comfortable to 
practice side by side. As

“The public is welcome to 

the temple on Sundays, and we 
certainly invite people who are 
interested or curious to come 
along,” Haju said. “And we’ll be 
happy to have them experience the 
service as well as answer questions 
and all of that.”

The 
Ann 
Arbor 
Buddhist 

Temple, no matter where you come 
from, takes you into its arms and 
lets you, even if only for a morning, 
experience the power of a purely 
accepting community.

this week’s event:

When the hell is the Pizzzza coming? For fuck’s sake. This movie sucks so bad. I can’t stop laughing. 

Y’all fuckin look like PS2. Look at this green screen. John Williams must be rolling in his grave. “He’s 
dead” says matt. I literally cant believe how much of a Blade Runner ripoff this goddamn movie in. But it’s 
not even as good. This just shows how great the force awakens really is. Literally nothing interesting has 
happened in this movie and it’s bad.

20 minutes into Netflix and chill and Padme says “please don’t look at me like that.” (ACTUAL 

LINE FROM THIS MOVIE ISN’T IT FUCKING ROMANTIC)

I would so much rather be watching the red letter media review than this. The 

pizza got here, and it was literally the best thing that’s ever happened to me. 

I’m so full but I just want to eat more of it. Can we talk about how 

great food is?

“A kiss that you should never have given me…” 

this movie sucks so bad. I’m actually appalled, 

insulted even.

“Duel of the fates” started 
playing. This is the best part of 

the prequels. The only other things 

I liked in this movie so far were the obi-

wan vs. djanfo unchained fight and the noise 

the seismic chargers made. Everything else sucks.

Watto 
is 
definitely 
a 
jewish 
gstereotype. 

HEEEEEEEEYYYY ANNNNIIIIIEEEEEEE YOU GIVE ME 

SHEKELSSSSS ( EDITORS LINK TO “IF I WERE A RICH MAN 

FROM THE GREAT FILM FIDDLETR ON THE ROOF)

There’s this sequence where Anakin raids the Tuscan raiders camp and it’s 

stolen completely from The Searchers (John Ford, who cares?) shot and all. George 

lucas is such a remix xulture.

“Stay with me mom” no I want to die rather than talk to you more you little shit

Meesa no like this movie. Meesa want to die.

—DAILY ARTS WRITER

I actually haven’t seen this movie in a long time, now I’m 

reminded why. As we sit down to watch the film, tensions 

are already high as I watch the first few minutes of the 

movie through smoke — unfortunately it didn’t block 

the screen. Baked just started to fight me over 

something (I think over how shitty Yoda looks). 
He knocks over the chair I’m sitting in and I pin 
him to the ground. Needless to say I won and 
our fight choreography is better than most of 
this movie’s.

 
I honestly forgot how boring this whole 

assassination plot was. “I mean, a plan that 
involves phallic death worms, an assassin lizard 
woman and a speeder chase can’t be that boring,” 

I think to myself as the cold, hard reality sets in. 

And all of a sudden we’re dividing our main cast (for 

how good of friends Anakin and Obi-Wan are supposed 

to be, they sure don’t spend a lot of screentime together). 

Also, why are we giving responsibility to Jar Jar Binks? That’s a 

worse move than electing Donald Trump — or maybe Jar Jar is more like Sarah Palin with their unin-
telligible dialect. Thankfully the pizza has come to give us relief, thank the midichlorians!

Now we get to watch the cringe-inducing awkwardness of Anakin and Padme’s “romance.” Buzzed 

is starting to drink whenever Anakin stares creepily at Padme, and I lament for his poor liver. We get 
the iconic, “I hate sand” double entendre (poor Hayden Christensen, Daniel Day Lewis couldn’t make 
that line work). Buzzed chugged his drink for the duration of that first kiss (note: that was hard liquor). 
Now Anakin’s talking about dreaming about her every night, and I think Natalie Portman (who is gor-
geous in this movie) is genuinely uncomfortable. If anyone is in need of relationship remix, it’s Anakin 
Skywalker — no means no, buddy. Oh well, nothing a little testicle cow riding can’t fix.

As much as I rip on this movie, the sound design for the seismic charge is a work of goddamn genius. 

Unfortunately the rest of the dogfight between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett is ruined by Boba Fett provid-
ing commentary over the whole thing. Baked has decided to go to bed after Anakin’s nice little geno-
cide — Padme seems way too OK with this.

Let’s just get this over with. This movie is bad. It’s an overly complicated mess of weird names and 

characters we never see, the dialogue is painful and hardly any of the special effects hold up (Yoda is 
particularly bad). It’s like the filmmakers took Phantom Menace as a template, asked “What did we 
do wrong?” kept those things and ruined anything that worked. Somehow, against all odds, they were 
able to make a battle featuring like 100 Jedi boring and the final duels with Count Dooku (R.I.P. Chris-
topher Lee) are even worse. Just watch the two “Clone Wars” animated series that aired on Cartoon 
Network, somehow these cartoons are more mature and realistic than this green screen mess.

—MATTHEW BARNAUSKAS

Yoda’s CG brown eyes still can’t sparkle with the sexual lustre 

of Natalie Portman’s lip gloss. WAIT, Anakin has a RAT-TAIL? 
Buns have never been hotter. Why does no one talk about how 
sexy Obi-Wan is? God, I want to cut Jar Jar into sushi and eat him 
with sriracha. This plan is so convoluted. Gratuitously sexual 
assassin. Unnecessarily complex assassination plot. Say what you 
want about hayden Christensen, the speeder scene is still dope 
to the nines. Anakin’s enunciation is too goddamn good. Light-
saber used as pickaxe You’d think the Force would allow you to 
maneuver through a crowd withoutr looking like a sexually con-
flicted goofball. Deathsticks scene: don’t do drugs, kids. Even the 
moments of inspiration in this film are dopey. It’s trying to rip off 
bladerunner but it’s joggin’ and trippin’. CG cheeks jiggle weirdly. 
Are the women’s hair INTENTIONALLY stupid? Every time 
Padme’s hair comes onscreen I feel like it should be announced by 
the John Cena theme. “Please don’t look at me like that” — Padme, 
to Anakin. No Netflix, no chill. If that kiss weren’t in the script, it 
never would have happened. That come-hither look was game-
less. Anakin Skywalker is a masterclass in how NOT TO act when 
you have absurd power as a young white cis jedi male. Chubby 
loser nerd padawan answers important question. Wipe transi-
tions are the grape drank of cinema. Anakin is a White Knight 
Nice Guy. He just said Milady, for crying out loud! Don’t play that 
game Ani. You only want to tap that. I don’t like sand either Ana-
kin. “My mistress’ eyes are nothing like the … sand.” Romance 
scene in field. Is this a rom-com? Because go fuck yourselves. 

You’re trying too hard. Seismic charge — the reapers noise in Mass Effect. Boba fett is Aussie? Okay, the 
emotional shenanigans with respect to Anican’s mom’s death — key!

wHERE ARE WE? WHAT’S GOING ON NOW? MY AMERICAN ATTENTION SPAN CAN’T TOL-

ERATE THIS LACK OF ACTION.

For The Daily

You’ve probably seen the story 

on social media about how the 
merchandise for “Star Wars: The 
Force Awakens” angered long-
time fans of the franchise when 
the protagonist Rey (Daisy Rid-
ley, “Scrawl”) was not depicted 
in most of the promotional toys. 
The way Rey has been left out 
of the toys used to promote the 
seventh 
installment 
parallels 

the lack of toys made depicting 
Black Widow (Scarlett Johans-
son, “Lucy”) when “Avengers: 
Age of Ultron” was released last 
year, which went so far as to 
replace her with Captain Amer-
ica in a Lego set based on a scene 
she starred in. Even “The Force 
Awakens” director J.J. Abrams 
has expressed his disapproval at 
the lack of Star Wars merchan-
dise depicting Rey, according 
to Entertainment Weekly. After 
Leia made the change from prin-
cess to general for the Resistance 
in “The Force Awakens,” there is 
no doubt in my mind Abrams and 
his team expanded the possibili-
ties for women in this cinematic 
universe and beyond. I hope 
filmmakers follow his lead to 
provide characters that female 
moviegoers can relate to and be 
inspired by just like their male 
counterparts.

I longed for such representa-

tion growing up and never got 
it. The few movies with heroines 
who made it to the big screen — 
like Jennifer Garner’s “Elektra” 
and Halle Berry’s “Catwoman” 
— were critically panned as some 
of the worst movies ever made. I 
thought it was unfair these char-
acters were so poorly adapted, 
as it robbed me of fictional do-
gooders I could see myself in as I 
strived to become someone who 
could take care of herself. 

This was always apparent on 

Halloween, when us girls would 
be pushed to dress like demure 
princesses or pretty fairies, 
while the boys got to emulate 
butt-kickers like Superman, G.I. 
Joe and other men who made 
a difference. Those who dared 
demonstrate their connection to 
the good role models presented 
in these male-dominated genres 
were ridiculed for wearing a 
“boy’s costume.”

Obviously, 
just 
because 

someone has a different gen-
der than you doesn’t mean you 
can’t relate to them. However, 
I found it deeply discouraging 
that the women in these films 
only served as a distracting love 
interest, such as Mary Jane in 
the “Spider-Man” franchise, or 
an administrative sidekick that 
provided emotional support as 
a man struggled to save the day, 

such as Pepper Potts in the “Iron 
Man” franchise.

I want the toy industry to 

know they are wrong if they 
believe the horribly outdated 
stereotypes that boys won’t sup-
port a female hero and girls only 
want to be princesses. Many of 
my female friends growing up 
owned merchandise of the male 
heroes they wanted to be like 
in spite of their gender. Once, 
when we were little and play-
ing make-believe, my brother 
was upset he couldn’t play as 
the tomboy Buttercup from 
“The Powerpuff Girls” because 
he was of the opposite sex, even 
though he identified with her 
brash nature and admired her 
confidence. Moms, aunts and 
grandmas have shown me pic-
tures of their adorable little 
boys in Princess Elsa costumes 
from “Frozen” simply because 
they love her character.

Though the landscape of 

female heroes is changing, with 
Marvel’s “Jessica Jones” and 
“Agent Carter” making a splash 
in the TV world, there still are 
not enough women leading films 
as heroes. As girls have every 
right to be represented and 
addressed in the media as any 
other demographic, we need to 
embrace the few heroines we 
have to build a space in this mar-
ket for more to come.

Motherf*ckers act like they forgot about Rey.
Where are our Rey 
action figures, Walt?

By GIANCARLO BUONOMO 

Daily Food Columnist

When I first moved to Rome 

last winter and began walk-
ing around the neighborhood 
that would be my home for the 
next four months, it wasn’t 
the ancient, crumbling Aure-
lian walls that made the biggest 
impression on me. It wasn’t the 
preponderance of Vespas, or the 
number of Apollo and Venus 
lookalikes. It was that within 
two blocks of my apartment, 
there were four butcher shops. 
Four busy, expansive butcher 
shops, staffed by greying men in 
blood-stained aprons. At home 
in Boston, I knew of only one 
devoted butcher shop in the 
whole city — most people just 
went to the supermarket. Some-
times, I’d tiptoe into one of the 
shops, listening to the thump of 
cleavers against wooden boards 
and breathing in the heavy, ripe 
aroma of raw flesh, until someone 
finally asked me if I was going to 
buy something. That these shops 
all thrived despite their proxim-
ity, and that everyone seemed to 
shop there, fascinated me.

Whenever I walk into Ann 

Arbor’s Sparrow Market, I think 
back to happy moments in Rome. 
One of the only dedicated butch-
ers left in the area, Bob Sparrow 
has presided over his shop for 32 
years now, and has become the 
main source of high-quality meat 
for both home cooks and restau-
rant chefs alike. And for me — I 
recently began curing meat in my 
basement, and Sparrow was the 
only place in town where I could 
find pork cheeks.

I dropped by the shop recent-

ly to get the skinny (and the 
fatty) from Bob himself. When I 
arrived the other morning, Bob 
was behind the long glass dis-
play case, working on a mound of 
shell-pink chicken breasts. With 
a scimitar-like knife, he trims 
off the ragged edges, and then 
butterflies the meat open with 
a practiced swipe. Above him, 
two tanned hams and a bone saw 
hang from the ceiling. Beneath 
him, the tile floor sparkles, clean 
as a surgical theater.

“How are we doing, brother?” 

he said, rhyming “brother” with 
“udder.” “You don’t mind if I 

work while we talk, right?”

In person, Bob doesn’t look like 

your stereotypical butcher. Jerky-
thin, with a shaved head, thick 
black glasses and a soft voice, he 
gives off a somewhat monkish 
aura. But Bob’s been at the cutting 
board his entire life. He grew up 
in tiny Willis, Michigan, 20 miles 
outside of Ann Arbor, on a work-
ing farm. He’d help his parents 
slaughter the animals they raised 
and taught himself knife work by 
trapping and skinning fox, mink 
and raccoon.

He moved to Ann Arbor 34 

years ago, and apprenticed for a 
bit with another butcher, but he 
liked being his own boss better. 
After two years, he and his wife 
opened up Sparrow Meat Mar-
ket in Kerrytown, and they’ve 
been there ever since. In his 
time, Bob’s seen more than a 
few local butchers go under, as 
supermarkets with pre-cut and 
packaged meat become more 
popular with harried shoppers. 
Even when a small-time butcher 
hustles, it’s hard to compete with 
megamarts.

“I think it’s just too much 

work and not enough profit. You 
have to be much more involved 
— we’re open seven days a week, 
and I also own all of this,” he 
said, gesturing to the main space 
of the market, which holds pro-
duce and dry goods and other 
specialty products. “The only day 
we’re closed is Christmas.”

For a while, American butcher 

shops seemed destined for the 
slaughter. According to the Chi-
cago Tribune, there was an 18 
percent decrease between 1997 
and 2007. In Britain, it was even 
worse — by 2008, 23 butcher 
shops were closing every month. 
As profits decreased, and fewer 
and fewer people were interested 
in apprenticing, many butchers 
were forced to retire or sell their 
businesses.

When I asked Bob if the num-

ber of customers had decreased 
in recent years, he gave an 
amused smile.

“No, it’s gone waaaaaayyyyy 

up. Especially younger people,” 
he said. “Definitely it’s the young-
er crowd, not people my own age, 
who are more open-minded.”

As gourmet cooking, local 

ingredients and an overall obses-

sion with craft become more and 
more popular in America, butch-
ers like Bob are experiencing a 
needed boost in both sales and 
appreciation. Not that the work 
itself has gotten any easier — 
butchery requires lifting heavy 
hunks of meat, and wielding 
blades sharp enough to cut them 
(or a finger) straight in half. But 
Bob sees his role as a butcher as 
more than just a fabricator of 
flesh. He’s the link to their food 
that most people don’t realize 
they want until they enter the 
butcher shop.

“I know it’s the internet age 

and all, and everyone’s always 
walking around on their phones, 
but they still want human interac-
tion,” he said. “You can’t kill that.”

“I’m not a picky eater, but I 

want to see where my food came 
from and who’s handled it,” he 
added.

He takes this role so seriously 

that he’s willing to slice through 
popular appeal and forgo bou-
tique farms in favor of larger, 
better established meatpackers 
in Detroit, if he doesn’t think the 
product meets his standards.

“I’m reluctant if someone calls 

me up and says ‘I’ve been an 
organic or grass-fed farmer for 
two years,’” he explains. “I don’t 
think you really know enough 
at that point to be selling to the 
public.”

Bob has increased his business 

by supplying meat to various res-
taurants around town. But he’s 
also become the go-to guy for 
anyone in town interested in pre-
paring the more overlooked ani-
mals and organs — suckling pigs, 
pheasants, 
sweetbreads, 
pork 

cheeks, Bob can find pretty much 
anything if you ask him.

As I prepared to leave, Bob 

asked me if there was anything 
special I wanted him to order for 
me.

“Can you get me beef bung?” I 

asked. Beef bungs are the stom-
ach lining of cow, used to encase 
large pieces of meat during cur-
ing.

“Beef bungs? You serious?”
“Shit,” I thought. “That was 

too weird of a request.” 

Bob reached into a cooler and 

pulled out of bag of bone white 
tubes.

“How many do you want?”
