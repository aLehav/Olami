In 
partnership 
with 
the 
Detroit 
Community-Academic 
Urban 
Research 
Center, 
University of Michigan student 
organization Poverty Solutions 
took on nine, year-long projects 
in 2019 in an effort to combat 

the rising rates of poverty and 
evictions in Michigan using a 
cross-community 
collaborative 
approach.
Numerous cities within the 
state of Michigan, including 
Muskegon, 
Saginaw, 
Battle 
Creek and Dearborn Heights, are 
among the top 20 mid-size cities 
in the United States with the 

highest rates of eviction.
Robert Goodspeed, assistant 
professor of urban planning, 
Margaret 
Dewar, 
emerita 
professor of urban planning and 
Elizabeth Benton, an attorney 
working with the Michigan 
Advocacy 
Program, 
will 
be 
conducting Michigan Evictions: 
Assessing Data Sources and 

Exploring Determinants, one of 
the nine projects. 
Goodspeed said the project 
aims to analyze the factors 
leading to eviction. He suggests 
some of the causes might include 
varying housing costs in different 
geographic locations and a lack of 
access to legal services.

Upbound at Work is an 
outgrowth of Autism Alliance 
of 
Michigan, 
a 
Michigan-
based nonprofit organization, 
which leads efforts to expand 
opportunities for people affected 
by autism. President and CEO 
Colleen Allen developed the 
program five years ago along 
with Chief Programming Officer 
Tammy Morris. Upbound at 
Work aims to connect those with 
disabilities seeking employment 
to companies so they are able 
to lead a successful career. 
Upbound at Work collaborates 
directly with disability services 
and career services on the 
University of Michigan campus.
The program started because 
companies who had hired an 
individual with autism often 
consulted 
Autism 
Alliance 
as 
mediators 
for 
instances 
where the employee’s job was 
in jeopardy and about to be 
terminated. Morris stated often, 
it was because of something as 
simple as miscommunication or 
misunderstanding. Additionally,

Grillcheezerie 
Sandwich 
Shoppe closed its doors after four 
years in Ann Arbor.
The restaurant originated in 
the city of Southgate. The original 
location closed in 2014, less than 
a year after its opening. Facebook 
users said the limited seating and 
high prices made the Southgate 
location undesirable.
Nick Costos, the owner of 
Grillcheezerie, previously operated 
Mr. Greek’s Coney Island on South 
State Street from 1995 to 2006. In 
2014, he had the idea to re-open 
Grillcheezerie in a new location on 
Packard Street. 
Costos told MLive in 2014 that 
the shop would offer more than 10 
varieties of sandwiches, costing 
between $4 and $7 each, in addition 
to traditional macaroni and cheese, 
soups and salads.
Grillcheezerie was a counter-
service 
restaurant 
with 
a 
delivery option and could seat 
approximately 
12-15 
people 
at a time, Costos said in the 
interview. He was inspired to open

Rebecca 
Veidlinger, 
Law 
School lecturer and current 
Title IX investigator, has begun 
teaching a course focused on 
Title IX and its role in institutions 
of higher education. The course 
centers 
upon 
policy 
issues 
relating to the investigation 
of sexual misconduct and the 
importance of other federal laws 
in response to these allegations. 
Veidlinger, 
who 
investigates 
allegations 
of 
gender-based 
discrimination 
and 
sexual 
violence as an attorney in private 
practice, structured the class as 
a 16-person seminar in order to 
facilitate open discussion and 
debate.
The University revised its 
sexual misconduct policy after 
the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of 
Appeals ruled in September 
2018 that public universities 
“must give the accused student 
or his agent an opportunity to 
cross-examine 
the 
accuser.” 
Echoing this decision, Secretary 

of 
Education 
Betsy 
DeVos 
strengthened 
the 
rights 
of 
defendants in Title IX cases by 
allowing for a period of cross-
examination 
between 
the 
accuser and accused in November 
2018. These developments in 
Title IX policy have created a 
ripple across campus, with letter 
writing campaigns and student 
group petitions.
Veidlinger said her work as an 
attorney and investigator offers 
students a real-world perspective 
on these issues to enhance their 
understanding of legal theory.
“I cannot only teach the 
theory, the legal bases like case 
law and the legal texts, but I can 
also share with them what I’m 
seeing on ground,” Veidlinger 
said. “We’ll learn about the 
regulations and then I’m going to 
tell them: here’s what this looks 
like in real life.”
This class has been taught 
previously, but it is the first time 
Veidlinger is teaching it. Law 
School student Rebecca Strauss, 
who is enrolled in the class, said

MADELINE HINKLEY/Daily
Washtenaw County Health Officer Ellen Rabinowitz, Washtenaw County Commissioner Dr. Felicia Brabec, and Assistant Professor of Health Behavior and 
Education Dr. Paul Fleming discuss health equity at the Ann Arbor District Library Thursday evening. 


The Graham Sustainability 
Institute at the University of 
Michigan awarded Catalyst 
Grants 
to 
four 
cross-
disciplinary 
sustainability 
projects 
this 
January. 
Jennifer Haverkamp, director 
of the Graham Institute, said 
the winning projects embody 
the value of partnership and 
community involvement in 
research and will develop 
real-world applications over 
the course of the semester.
“What we hope in each case 
is that faculty and students 
working 
together 
with 
external partners generate 
research results that have real 
value and use in the world of 
sustainability,” she said.
According to Haverkamp, 
the collaborative nature of 
the 
sustainability 
projects 
will 
lead 
to 
effective 
sustainability 
applications 
in the areas of engineering, 
botany and public policy.

“Ultimately, the Graham 
Institute 
is 
focused 
on 
fostering 
sustainable 
solutions in the real world, 
which 
requires 
robust 
collaboration across sectors,” 
she said. “These projects are 
excellent examples of putting 
that mission into action and 
bringing 
U-M 
expertise 
to 
bear 
in 
partnership 
with 
practitioners 
and 
policymakers 
beyond 
the 
University.”
The 
research 
teams, 
which include faculty from 
the School for Environment 
and 
Sustainability, 
Stamps 
School of Art & Design, Ford 
School of Public Policy, the 
Earth 
and 
Environmental 
Science department and the 
Climate and Space Sciences 
and Engineering department, 
are beginning work with the 
$10,000 Catalyst Grants. The 
projects include Expanding 
the Renewable Energy Policy 
Initiative, which encourages 
local and state government 
officials to support equitable 

access 
to 
clean 
energy 
technology, and Cut or Keep: 
Farmer Perceptions and Tree 
Management 
in 
Forested 
Cocoa and Coffee Agriculture, 
which will help farmers in 
Ethiopia and Ghana decide 
how to use their land. The 
two other grant recipients are 
The Rust Belt Herbarium and 
Better Communicating Great 
Lakes Ice Forecasts.

All four will involve 
the 
development 
of 
environmental 
sustainability 
applications with partners 
and stakeholders.
Ayumi 
Fujisaki-
Manome, 
principal 
investigator 
for 
Better 
Communicating 
Great 
Lakes 
Ice 
Forecasts, 
will be developing an 
improved 
interface 
for 
ice forecasts with the U.S. 
Coast Guard 9th District 
and 
Lake 
Carrier’s 
Association.
“Researchers 
and 
stakeholders will meet to 
discuss what’s needed for 
forecasting information,” 
Fujisaki-Manome 
said. 
“We are going to include 
an 
interactive 
graphic 
development 
system 
so we can improve the 
forecast graphic alongside 
stakeholders.”
The 
Rust 
Belt 

Herbarium 
project 
will 
document the flora of the 
greater Detroit area in order 
to fill knowledge gaps about 
urban plants, explained Anton 
Reznicek, herbarium curator 
and project co-director.
“For some of these species 
our information is thin,” he 
said. “Plants that are weeds of 
these kinds of urban settings 
are the most dynamic element 
of the flora … but we don’t 
have as much information as 
you might think.”
The herbarium project will 
also hold meetings with local 
stakeholders and create an 
Instagram account to share 
findings.
Daniel Phillips, a doctoral 
candidate 
in 
the 
School 
for 
Environment 
and 
Sustainability, explained the 
herbarium will be working 
with community stakeholders 
to hear their feedback. 
“The people who live in 
these neighborhoods have a 
vested interest,” Phillips said. 
“We will mediate between 
larger long-term goals and 
the immediate needs of the 
community. … The only way 
we 
can 
understand 
these 
needs is to have conversations 
with people.”
Business 
junior 
Elsa 
Borrello, 
a 
Graham 
Sustainability 
Scholar, 
reflected on the importance of 
an interdisciplinary approach 
to addressing sustainability 
issues.
“I think it’s really important 
to bring together people who 
are interested in the sciences, 
to 
share 
knowledge 
with 
business people who can bring 
new perspectives and solve 
a problem more holistically,” 
she said.
Haverkamp looks forward 
to 
hearing 
from 
future 
Catalyst Grant applicants and 
is hopeful about the research 
projects selected this January.
“We look forward to robust 
interest in the next round 
of grants and look forward 
to seeing the results of the 
grants that we just issued,” 
she said.

Business junior Sonia Lee on her story “Study shows HAIL scholarship 
increases low-SES student population, recipients still say lacks guidance 
for integration”:

“The first thing I learned is that while the University has been trying to make great strides 
to attract more lower-SES students, there are still a lot of improvements to be made. I think 
the biggest change we can make would be to just listen to students who are receiving these 
scholarships, and provide necessary resources to them once they get here.”

“I interviewed two students for the article. I liked interviewing both of them because while 
their experiences with HAIL were really different, at the core, they had a lot of the same 
issues, but they also saw some of the same benefits of it. Just to hear that HAIL was the 
thing that made them interested in coming to the University was something that was really 
great to hear.

INSTITUTIONALIZING EQUIT Y

Michelle Bolofer, the Executive Director of Century Forward, a nonprofit focused on building community infrastructure, speaks at the Urban Planning 
Martin Luther King Jr. Symposium on “Institutionalizing Equity: Radically Restructuring Opportunity in Detroit” in the Art and Architecture Building 
Thursday evening.

“It is evident that eviction 
is a state-wide phenomenon,” 
Goodspeed said. “Is it other factors 
like the cost of housing, or a lack of 
affordable housing in particular 
locations? Or is it the access to 
legal systems? The number of 
legal attorneys available and how 
close you are to their office really 
varies a lot throughout the state. 
(Attorneys) are doing their best, 
but just have limited resources.”
After observing the available 
data, Goodspeed hopes to identify 
patterns in eviction rates and then 
take it one step further by changing 
public policy.
“The other focus of the project 
is to understand the substantive 
patterns and work with courts 
to understand the data they 
have and then come up with 
recommendations on how the 
court system and how policy 
leaders can better track evictions 
in the state,” Goodspeed said. “We 
want to know how accurate is the 
data that is available and how we 
can set up systems so that we can 
monitor this system going forward. 
Because right now, there is not a 
good mechanism of doing that.”
Benton 
is 
an 
attorney 
at 
Legal Services of South Central 
Michigan, a legal firm in the 
Michigan 
Advocacy 
program 
that services low-income families 
involved in custody and evictions 
cases. She stressed the importance 
of this project, as evictions place 
an overwhelming amount of stress 
on these families already facing 
numerous challenges.
“Our concern is relative because 
we are representing these clients 
every day and see the tremendous 
impact that evictions have on their 
lives,” Benton said. “It’s not just 
about having to move, which is very 
disruptive — but it involves time off 
of work and time away from school. 
Housing is central to people’s lives, 
stability and wellbeing. So when 
they are evicted, it’s just a really 
horrible experience.”
Goodspeed 
and 
Benton’s 
eviction venture is just one of the 
nine projects created in attempt to 
mitigate large-scale poverty. More 
than $200,000 was distributed 
from Poverty Solutions among 
the projects to continue in the 
fight against financial inequality. 
Many of these projects will allow 
numerous 
University 
schools 
and colleges, including public 
health, nursing, social work and 
Michigan Medicine, to conduct 
research in collaboration with the 
greater Ann Arbor community. 
These partnerships include aid 
from the Detroit Community-
Academic Urban Research Center, 
the Detroit Health Department, 
the Henry Ford Health System, 
the Community Health and Social 
Services Center and many other 
community-run facilities.
Luke 
Shaefer, 
director 
of 
Poverty 
Solutions 
and 
Public 
Policy professor, believes this 

system-level approach helps the 
community as a whole better 
understand and address poverty.
“The government can’t do it 
alone, the private sector can’t do it 
alone, and the University certainly 
can’t do it alone,” Shaefer said. “But 
we can if we work together. The 
role for the University is to bring 
data and analysis to bare so that 
we’re targeting the right policies 
and so that we really understand 
what we’re trying to grapple 
together. To really find solutions 
that work, we really have to have a 
working partnership.”
LSA senior Zachary Tingley, 
research 
assistant 
at 
Poverty 
Solutions, believes it is the duty 
of the University as a public 
institution to play a pivotal role 
in 
engaging 
with 
economic 
inequality.
“I think it’s important U-M 
conducts this research because any 
institution has a moral obligation 
to instigate change,” Tingley said. 
“The fact that Poverty Solutions is 
action-based and engaged with the 
community allows the University 
to recognize its impact on the 
community around it and embrace 
partnerships with non-university 
stakeholders.”
Other joint projects running 
this year include the testing of a 
simulation exercise called CHAT 
(CHoosing All Together), with goal 
of helping overlooked, minority 
members of different communities 
establish and prioritize health 
benefits. Poverty Solutions will 
also tackle food insecurity issues 
within impoverished homes by 
providing cooking classes. These 
plan to teach strategies that help 
reduce food waste and budget 
healthy and inexpensive meal 
plans.
Poverty Solutions has resourced 
about $9 million to fund research 
initiatives which have already 
produced an outlasting impact. 
Their research has altered the way 
Detroit Public Schools collect data 
on their homeless students and 
helped implement new methods 
to deliver community-wide health 
care support.
Though these projects will only 
run through the 2019 calendar year, 
Shaefer believes the initiatives will 
have a lasting effect on the fight 
against economic inequality and 
high eviction rates.
“I think (the team) is going to 
really map out and get a sense of 
what’s going on with the eviction 
landscape in a year’s time,” Shaefer 
said. “We will be able to find out 
what we can do to try to keep 
people in their homes while also 
supporting the overall ecosystem, 
and how we might be able to 
increase the affordable housing 
units. These types of policy levels 
are where the rubber hits the 
road. So, hopefully, in a year they 
have come to some proposed 
recommendations 
that 
could 
be moved forward. Sometimes 
change happens very quickly, 
and sometimes it’s much slower, 
so we’ll have to see what the 
landscapes hold.”

free case management to people 
who reached out seeking advice 
finding 
employment, 
helped 
launch 
the 
foundations 
of 
Upbound at Work.
“There were about 300 job 
seekers just in Michigan, so 
when we started we already had 
a base of about 300 job seekers,” 
Morris said.
Though Autism Alliance is the 
umbrella organization, Upbound 
at Work is not limited to 
assisting just those with autism. 
The 
organization 
maintains 
corporate 
contracts 
and 
partnerships with companies 
such as Ford, General Motors 
and Daimler so Upbound at 
Work can communicate with 
recruiters who specialize in 
helping people find employment. 
Upbound at Work seeks to bridge 
the gap between employers and 
job seekers.
Beyond 
initial 
outreach, 
Upbound at Work helps with the 
employment process every step 
of the way. Hetal Patel is one of 
the communication specialists 

who works one-on-one with 
job seekers in order to provide 
support 
for 
various 
areas, 
including problem solving, non-
verbal 
communication 
skills, 
interviews 
and 
interpersonal 
skills. Patel works with the job 
seekers to provide an initial 
consultation and make goals; it 
is very much an individualized 
process.
“I enjoy being able to work 
through the various obstacles 
individuals seeking employment 
face and finding sustainable and 
suitable 
employment 
options 
that allow the use of individual 
strengths,” Patel said. “Seeing 
how the support we put in 
place is beneficial not only to 
the individual but the entire 
organization has been rewarding 
to see as well.”
Kelly Cole is the vocational 
rehabilitation 
manager 
specializing 
in 
rehabilitation 
counseling. As she transitioned 
from her role as a job navigator 
with Autism Alliance to helping 
with employment at Upbound 
at Work, she was able to work 
with job seekers to build their 
skills and strategize with them 
while also acting as a support 
network once they were hired. 

She explained how retention is 
important for long term growth.
“It’s so unique; everybody is 
so different,” Cole said. “Every 
single case is kind of like a 
brain teaser. It helps me check 
myself and treat everyone as 
an individual who wants to live 
independently and live their own 
lives. And once I get positive 
feedback and see the lives 
that are being changed, I am 
reminded of why I do what I do.”
Such 
direct 
services, 
like 
professional 
skills 
coaching, 
have been working.
Ronald 
Larson, 
professor 
of 
chemical 
engineering 
at 
the University, explains the 
experience his son went through 
with Upbound at Work. Through 
his son, Andrew, graduated in 
2014 with a B.S. in Computer 
Science, 
he 
had 
trouble 
interviewing and adjusting to 
expectations due to social and 
cognitive deficits. And after a 
while, he became discouraged, 
Larson said.
“Thanks to the help from many 
kind people, and most recently 
and especially Tammy and her 
team, Andrew is on a good track 
now, and his added confidence 
has given him a great boost in 

continuing to work towards 
higher life functionality,” Larson 
said. “So, we are delighted with 
Upbound at Work program, and 
how much it has helped our son.”
Morris 
explained 
how 
it 
has grown in the past couple 
years, as there are much more 
job 
seekers 
coming 
to 
the 
organization. From individuals 
with backgrounds in aerospace 
engineering to those versed in 
coding, such job seekers bring 
with them a range of diverse skill 
sets.
“I think it’s because of the 
awareness 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
companies 
are 
looking 
and 
welcoming,” 
Morris 
said. 
“They’re 
diverse 
individuals 
who are a little bit different so 
getting the message out that it’s 
okay.”
The organization aspires to 
raise awareness about these 
issues in order to create a more 
tolerant environment. Due to the 
competitive nature of the field, 
those with invisible disabilities 
are often hesitant to disclose 
their disability.
“The impact of having a job is 
life changing,” said Morris. “It’s 
an entryway into everything.”

Veidlinger’s background as an 
attorney in private practice offers 
a unique opportunity to learn from 
someone further removed from 
the University administration.
“In the past, this course has 
been co-taught by the general 
counsel of the University and 
the Title IX coordinator of the 
University,” Strauss said. “I’ve 
heard that the perspective was a 
little more biased in favor of what 
the University does to deal with 
these things, and I’m excited to be 
able to learn from a professional 
with an outside perspective.”
Gil Seinfeld, associate dean 
for 
academic 
programming 
at the Law School, noted how 
Veidlinger’s experience in Title 

IX investigation demonstrates her 
serious commitment to enforcing 
the law she teaches.
“For any faculty member, it 
is so important to communicate 
genuine immersion in and about 
the 
subject 
matter,” 
Seinfeld 
said. “I think she (Veidlinger) is 
obviously seriously engaged and 
enthusiastic about teaching and 
she’s going to bring that into the 
classroom.”
Strauss 
hopes 
the 
course 
will provide her with a legal 
framework 
to 
better 
inform 
her opinions. Strauss is a board 
member of the Gender Violence 
Project, a student organization 
within the Law School which 
raises awareness about gender 
discrimination in the American 
legal 
system 
and 
represents 
victims of sexual assault. Strauss 
said her work with the project has 

made her increasingly passionate 
about defending the rights of 
accusers, but also acknowledged 
it is necessary to eliminate bias in 
order to study law.
“Title IX proceedings within 
the University aren’t judicial 
proceedings — there aren’t as 
many rules,” Strauss said. “Under 
this policy, it’s totally cool for your 
rapist to come up and slut-shame 
you in front of decision makers. 
I think that’s really troubling 
and unfair to complainants who 
are already going through this 
potentially traumatic process. But 
I also understand that I have a lot 
of personal biases about that and I 
think it would do me some good to 
look at the full picture.”
Veidlinger said the course 
consists of in-class discussions 
regarding the history and current 
use of Title IX policy in higher 

education. Instead of a final 
exam, there will be a paper on any 
topic a student finds particularly 
interesting related to Title IX. 
Veidlinger noted how the study 
of Title IX is not complete until it 
incorporates current events and 
changes to policy that frequently 
arise.
“In my experience, something 
that is so interesting about Title IX 
is there are so many current events 
going on over the past few years, 
and I suspect into the future, that I 
think it’s a great time to study Title 
IX,” Veidlinger said. “I wouldn’t 
be surprised if my syllabus has to 
change mid-way through based 
on changes that may come down 
through court decisions or agency 
actions from the Department of 
Education.”

New MSU President appointed following 
Engler’s resignation of the position

Satish Upda, the school’s executive vice president for admin services, will take the post

The Michigan State University 
Board of Trustees named Satish Udpa, 
the school’s executive vice president 
for administrative services, interim 
president 
on 
Thursday 
morning 
following the John Engler’s resignation.

Board member Brian Mosallam 
said during the meeting he saw the 
resignation of Engler and appointment 
of Udpa as the start of a new era 
on campus, the Detroit Free Press 
reported Thursday morning.
“On this day, our survivors no 
longer have to go to bed thinking no 
one would listen to them,” Mosallam 
said in the meeting. “Today, the healing 
can begin.”
The appointment comes after an 
11-page resignation letter from Interim 
President 
John 
Engler 
released 
Wednesday night. Engler came under 
new criticism after the release of a 
statement to The Detroit News in 
which he commented about a healing 

fund. He said survivors of Larry 
Nassar, who was sentenced to 40-175 
years in state prison for criminal 
sexual conduct charges in January 
2018, were enjoying the spotlight 
created by the case.
In a letter sent to MSU staff 
and faculty in January 2018, Upda 
wrote MSU must work to address 
its mistakes and emphasized the 
importance of devoting time and 
resources to healing and creating a 
campus culture which provides a safe 
environment for all members of the 
community.
“The pain inflicted on young 
women and girls, some of whom are 
our students, indeed our children, will 
remain seared in our memories as long 
as we live,” Upda wrote. “MSU has 
been a beacon of hope for more than 
160 years to many around the world. 
While we are ready to identify and face 
our mistakes, we cannot stop building 
on the mountain of good that we have 
been privileged to build. We cannot let 

this tragedy define us. Our collective 
will to be a force of good has to prevail.”
Engler also faced criticism in 
December over his decision to close 
a $10 million healing fund created 
to pay for mental health services for 
survivors of former MSU doctor Larry 
Nassar’s abuse. Board trustees voted 
the reopen the fund.
Engler’s appointment as interim 
president followed Lou Anna Simon’s 
resignation from the position in the 
wake of the Nassar scandal in January 
2018. Engler’s resignation came after 
board chairwoman Dianne Byrum 
told him the board was holding a 
special meeting Thursday morning, 
during which the board planned to 
fire him.
In his letter, Engler highlighted 
changes he made on campus during 
his tenure as president. Under his 
leadership, the University developed 
24-hour access to counseling and 
a new app for related services. The 
university’s health colleges, clinical 

operations and student wellness 
programs 
were 
all 
restructed 
during Engler’s time as president, 
and oversight of athletic trainers 
was transferred from doctors from 
coaches.
“The bottom line is that MSU 
is a dramatically better, stronger 
institution than it was one year ago,” 
the letter read. “It has been an honor to 
serve my beloved university.”
Upda held his vice president 
position at MSU since 2013 and served 
as dean of the engineering school for 
seven years before that.
As vice president for administrative 
services, 
Upda 
oversaw 
the 
university’s human resources, IT and 
facilities departments, as well as the 
offices of planning and budgets, land 
management and the Facility for Rare 
Isotope Beams, according to the Free 
Press.

must focus on the social climate 
of an individual as well. She 
mentioned that by researching a 
variety of topics, more evidence 
could be found that one’s health 
is influenced by more than just 
a handful of factors.
“We worked on a report 
called Reducing Youth Arrests 
Keeps 
Kids 
healthy 
and 
Successful,” Rabinowitz said. 
“Not 
necessarily 
something 
you think a health department 
would be involved in, but we’re 
really concerned about it and 
now we’re looking at what 
other communities have done.” 
Felicia 
Brabec, 
licensed 
psychologist and social worker, 
continued Rabinowitz’s theme 
of social determinants affecting 
one’s 
health 
and 
included 
how race is often tied in with 
determining 
one’s 
health 
situation. She explained how 
her offices have taken a new 
approach to combating health 
inequality.
“We are operating under 
something 
called 
‘targeted 
universalism’ which means that 
we are choosing to really focus 
on race and how it’s shared 
some of those determinants 
that we’ve heard about based 
on race,” Brabec said. “And 
what 
targeted 
universalism 
says is ‘Hey, we’re going to start 
with this sliver, we’re going to 
start with race, understanding 
that intersectionality is really 
important and part of all this 

and we’re not doing that to 
the detriment of these other 
intersectionalities, but this is 
where we’re starting.’”
 
She 
continued 
her 
presentation 
by 
informing 
the audience on how racism is 
institutional, individual and 
structural. She then brought the 
complexity of racism back to a 
local scale by citing an example 
of 
redlining 
in 
Kerrytown 
a few years ago. Redlining 
is the denial of a home in 
certain neighborhoods based 
on someone being deemed a 
“financial risk” because of their 
race. Brabec also supplied the 
statistic of Washtenaw County 
falling to the bottom 8 percent 
in the U.S. for upward income 
mobility.
The 
final 
panelist, 
Paul 
Fleming, 
assistant 
professor 
of health behavior and health 
education at the University, 
wrapped up the presentations 
by discussing what he deemed 
“the chilling effect” the 2016 
election had on undocumented 
immigrants attending health 
care 
professional’s 
visits. 
After 
intensive 
research 
at 
several 
different 
health 
care 
institutions, 
Fleming 
and his team found a reason 
why 
immigrants 
skipped 
out on appointments was an 
increase and pervasive fear 
of 
deportations. 
The 
fear 
has resulted in fractures and 
strategic behavioral changes.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
4 — Friday, January 18, 2019

J

ames 
Burrill 
Angell, 
the 
longest 
serving 
president at the University 
of 
Michigan, 
described 
the 
University 
as 
a 
place 
that 
would provide “an uncommon 
education for the common man.” 
From its founding, the University 
was supposed to offer an elite 
education to people without the 
means to afford one in other parts 
of the country. The quote is still 
often thrown around to describe 
what the University aspires to 
be. It is a valuable goal, but the 
University has fallen short. The 
University has made both getting 
admission as well as campus life 
harder for low and middle-income 
in-state students by admitting 
more disproportionately wealthy, 
out-of-state students. This trend 
goes 
against 
the 
obligation 
the 
University 
has 
to 
the 
Michiganders whose tax dollars 
fund it. The University has both 
the financial flexibility and moral 
obligation to reverse this trend.
I need to make a disclaimer: 
I make these arguments in 
spite of myself, as I think this 
University should admit fewer 
students like me. I am a product 
of this policy change. I attend 
this school with unbelievable 
privilege. As an out-of-state 
student with a family that is 
willing and able to support me 
emotionally and financially, I do 
not suffer from the consequences 
of the University’s admissions 
policies. Yet I, and other out-
of-state students, should want 
the University to accept more 
in-state students.
The 
University’s 
student 
demographics 
have 
changed 
— for the wealthier. Almost 10 
percent of students’ families 
are in the top 1 percent income 
bracket, while only about 16 
percent fall in the bottom 60 
percent. Additionally, only 15 
percent of students qualify for 
Pell Grants (a federal, need 
based financial aid package), 
a percentage which, based on 
results from a Washington Post 
study, is the ninth lowest out 
of the public universities in the 
top 100 colleges and universities 
list published by U.S. News & 
World Report. For comparison, 

at 
competitor 
schools 
like 
Michigan 
State 
University 
and University of California-
Berkeley, 23 percent of students 
qualify for Pell Grants.
A similar story can be told 
about the proportion of in-state 
students 
at 
the 
University. 
University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
has 
said 
that 
he 
wants “to keep the majority of 
undergrads from Michigan.” In 
2008, the proportion of in-state 
students was 67 percent, but it 
was only 51 percent in fall 2016. 
Considering the fact that for 
tuition and fees, in-state students 
pay $15,262 per year, while out-
of-state students pay $49,350, 
the reduction of in-state students 
from two-thirds to one-half of 
the student body makes both 
the University and its campus 
environment 
much 
wealthier. 
University officials are conscious 
of 
their 
motivations: 
The 
University is not need blind for 
out-of-state students, while it is 
for in-state ones, so taking more 
of the former makes financial 
sense.
To be fair, the University’s 
transition to accepting more 
out-of-state 
students 
follows 
a trend among flagship public 
universities around the country. 
Compared to other institutions, 
the 
University’s 
shifts 
look 
tame. 
The 
University 
of 
Alabama’s student body went 
from 72 percent in-state in 
2004 to 36 percent in-state in 
2014. One study found that the 
University of Washington did 
not even give in-state students 
an advantage. However, not all 
flagship institutions have the 
same financial flexibility as the 
University of Michigan.
One way to observe the 
University’s financial flexibility 
is by getting a tour. Anyone who 
has been around campus can see 
that the University continues 
to invest in new buildings and 
infrastructure 
projects. 
The 
brand-new 
Biological 
Science 
Building ($261 million) opened 
this year, while the Kraus Natural 
Science Building ($120 million) 
and the Michigan Union ($85 
million) have just started extensive 
renovations. The University also 

just released plans for the Central 
Campus Recreation Building ($150 
million) to follow suit.
A closer look at endowment 
growth 
also 
demonstrates 
this 
relative 
flexibility. 
The 
University’s endowment is the 
eighth largest among all U.S. 
universities 
and 
the 
second 
largest among public universities. 
Furthermore, 
the 
University’s 
endowment 
has 
a 
20-year 
annualized return rate of 9.6 
percent, which places it in the 
top 10 percentile of all university 
endowments. A top 10 endowment 
with a top 10 return rate should be 
able to do more.
Beyond 
the 
moral 
obligations the University has 
to Michiganders, there are a few 
reasons it would be in the its best 
interest to accept more in-state 
students. 
First, 
as 
Sociology 
professor Elizabeth A. Armstrong 
argues, 
by 
accepting 
more 
out-of-state 
students, 
flagship 
universities are creating a “party 
pathway” that takes away from 
their mission to be a vehicle of 
social mobility. Second, based 
on data from South Carolina, 
in-state students are more likely 
to remain in their home state 
after graduation than out-of-
state students, and thus are more 
likely to contribute to Michigan’s 
economy. 
When 
Michigan’s 
economy is strong, state higher 
education budget cuts are less 
likely. 
Last, 
admittng 
more 
in-state students would make 
Michiganders think more highly 
of the University. Instead of being 
perceived as a wealthy University 
for out-of-state students, they 
might see it as a place where they 
can go to school to get a great 
education.
I am an out-of-state student. 
These changes would make it 
harder for me and all out-of-
state students to get into the 
University. But also I want the 
University to be the best it can 
be, and one way to do that is by 
accepting more in-state students.

When solidarity proves most crucial
F

or a group of 30 close-

knit 
friends 
in 
my 

English medium school in 

Bangladesh, teenage pregnancy 

was not a taboo. Instead, it was 

abandonment and demonization 

from 
my 
boyfriend. 
It 
was 

inconsistent 
sympathy 
and 

ostracism from my friends. This 

dynamic serves as an example 

of the double standards that 

emerged in a growing feminist 

crowd, one that shied away from 

solidarity when I most needed it.

In ninth grade, I started 

dating the most “popular” boy in 

my class — the football (soccer) 

star. Everyone unconditionally 

sympathized with his alarming 

anger 
born 
from 
childhood 

trauma. 
Two 
days 
after 
I 

informed my boyfriend of my 

pregnancy 
scares, 
he 
broke 

up with me. Later, I walked 

into a local pharmacy full of 

judgmental 
male 
faces 
and 

bought two pregnancy tests. I 

took them that night at 4 a.m. 

The image of the plus sign 

remains my worst memory.

I immediately called my best 

friend and she offered to help 

out. When the news reached 

my ex-boyfriend, he ferociously 

threatened 
me. 
I 
countered 

with plans to release physical 

evidence, internalizing the fetus 

as my fault and my fault only. I 

eventually handled the situation 

with the help of my dad through 

a 
“black-market” 
in-clinic 

procedure. After skipping school 

for a week, I finally returned 

with heavy cramps and bleeding 

between my legs in my uniform. 

I expected my pain to end there, 

but I was surprised at what 

followed.

Vicious words against me 

had spread like cancer and my 

ex-boyfriend broadcasted that 

I had fabricated a pregnancy 

to trap him into getting back 

together 
with 
me. 
I 
still 

remember 
the 
excruciating 

pain I felt when I read a post 

on my his Facebook wall. It was 

labeled “Psycho Rams” (a not-

so-subtle nickname for myself) 

and he along with two women 

— individuals who now write 

about women’s empowerment 

— ‘liked’ the message. I still 

vividly remember the mortifying 

moment I learned that some 

of my friends, who knew of my 

misery before my abortion, had 

spent fun evenings high with 

him, even during the week 

where I was physically emptied 

and emotionally sliced open. 

Not only did they not support or 

believe me, but they were also 

indifferent to my pain.

I 
thought 
our 
friends, 

especially the girls, many of 

whom were vocal against sexism, 

would 
seriously 
condemn 

his actions and defend me. A 

handful of my close friends had 

warned him but were silenced 

by the majority of my classmates 

who disregarded my lifeline 

calls and excused him with 

their dangerously impenetrable 

soft spot. In other words, their 

favoritism towards my ex as 

both a man and the most popular 

boy of our school prevented 

them from acting against his 

malevolence, 
let 
alone 
even 

recognizing it.

When I voiced how betrayed 

I felt, I received sneaky jokes that 

indicated I was overreacting. 

Girls who declared themselves 

social 
justice 
warriors 
the 

following year — who now chide 

people for using “pussy” as a 

slang for coward — somehow 

failed to register that calling me 

dramatic snatched my slightest 

defense 
when 
I 
was 
most 

vulnerable. People’s insensitivity 

to my suffering exacerbated the 

trauma I was already burdened 

with. I felt as though hiding my 

sorrow was my only option to 

survive. Thus, months later, I 

pretended to enjoy social events 

with my friends, only to then go 

home and embark on a perilous 

journey of self-harm. I cried 

myself to sleep for a year, even 

after I left for boarding school.

Prior to starting college, 

many female friends, including 

those 
who 
didn’t 
support 

me at the time, emerged as 

radical 
feminists, 
organizing 

women’s marches and panels 

on women’s rights. By contrast, 

I 
refused 
to 
participate 
in 

feminist conversations because I 

witnessed the lack of sisterhood 

when I was harmed by a man in 

my friend group. And though 

almost six years have passed 

since the incident, few women 

friends 
have 
contacted 
me 

about it in seeking reflection. 

In 
conversations 
with 
some 

other female friends, if I ever 

slip my ex-boyfriend’s name, 

they nervously laugh or remain 

silent. I know some of them still 

venerate him. Only one female 

friend, 
the 
most 
outspoken 

feminist, who was also closest 

to my ex during the pregnancy, 

apologized to me — but only 

after she had fallen prey to one 

of his disrespectful deeds. She 

stated that “we were so stupid 

and young.” 

While I did appreciate her 

apology, I wasn’t and am still 

not seeking apologies because I 

understand that we make many 

dangerous mistakes when we 

are young and immature. But 

our ignorance must never justify 

our wrongs, especially when it 

threatens someone’s wellbeing. 

If we are going to march against 

widespread marginalization of 

victims in college, it is imperative 

to also consider circumstances 

of our youth when we deviated 

from the feminist values we 

now advocate for. We have to 

confront our past injustices in 

order to be genuinely supportive 

of women experiencing trauma 

in our current feminist spheres.

Another 
woman 
woefully 

revealed a few days ago that she 

mistrusted me last year when 

my ex uttered: “I never received 

solid proof of pregnancy.” I must 

note that he hypocritically lied 

to her, even after apologizing 

to me for willfully deserting me 

during the pregnancy. But even 

if he didn’t have evidence, the 

fact that a woman believed him 

over me just shows we often tend 

to side with the perpetrators and 

doubt the victims. It seems to be 

the norm that males, especially 

popular ones like my ex, easily 

gain our trust. But more often 

than not, they misuse this power 

to redeem themselves. In today’s 

world, we are quick to post “I 

believe her” when a woman 

speaks out on public hearings, 

but we paradoxically secretly 

doubt and shame them before 

providing support. Before we 

simply share articles on the 

#MeToo movement or campaign 

to “Believe and Support All 

Women,” it is imperative to fight 

the 
normalized, 
misogynist 

temptation to blindly believe men 

and question the authenticity of 

a woman’s agony. These are both 

important and interconnected 

pillars in equality and justice.

Despite my past struggle 

and ostracization, I am still 

incredibly 
lucky. 
My 
life 

continued without interruptions. 

My 
father 
was 
extremely 

supportive and I was blessed to 

have the choice of an abortion 

— privileges that I cannot take 

for granted. But demonization 

and lack of support from peers 

is fatal for someone already 

fighting with herself to overcome 

haunting memories. So I stress 

the 
importance 
of 
believing 

and supporting women through 

the recovery of a traumatic 

experience. And in order to 

exercise the full potential of our 

feminist endeavors in college 

and beyond, I emphasize the 

necessity 
to 
reflect 
on 
the 

blunders of our past. Blunders 

where we could have offered

the Detroit Free Press reported

Though identifying the rash is 
a breakthrough for prison officials

as 
Machelle 
Pearson 
have 
described 
the 
abject conditions that led to such 
medical quandaries at the facility. 
After Pearson was released from 
Huron Valley, her primary medical 
provider surmised the rash she 
contracted while there was a 
result of coming into contact with 
mold. Pearson, in an interview 
with the Free Press, recalled the 
mold accumulating in the showers 
— black fungus spreading across 
and 
eventually 
encompassing 
what was once a tile ceiling. When 
inmates 
cleaned 
the 
shower, 
they would have to squeegee the 
ceilings, inevitably leading to the 
water dripping onto their clothes 
and forcing them to essentially 
bathe in hazardous juices that 
remained in the fabric long after 
they were finished mopping.
Despite accounts like those 
from Pearson, officials in the 
prison reframe the issue as one 
brought on by inmates, not a 
dilapidated infrastructure. Citing 
an improper mixture of cleaning 
chemicals used by the women, 
rather than mold, they deflected 
blame from themselves in an 
attempt to dissuade the notion 
there was any wrongdoing on 
behalf of the leadership.
If one were to follow this 
particular strain of bureaucratic 
incompetence 
to 
its 
root, 
it 
would once again exhibit how 
overpopulation 
debilitates 
Michigan’s 
prison 
system. 
Policies that ensnare the state’s 

most 
vulnerable 
populations 
weigh down Michigan’s criminal 
justice system, with a state prison 
population that has ballooned 
to 40,000 and another 14,000 
in jails. Michigan has one of the 
highest rates of incarceration in 
the country.
The 
overstuffed 
criminal 
justice system, both state and 
nationwide, yields the kinds of 
inhumane living circumstances 
seen at Huron Valley. And 
this is hardly the first time 
there have been complaints 
lobbed against the women’s 
prison. Just this September, 
two experts who investigated 
the prison filed reports in 
federal court claiming that the 
overcrowding 
and 
crumbling 
conditions in the prison violate 
the Eighth Amendment to the 
Constitution 
as 
“cruel 
and 
unusual 
punishment.” 
The 
cramped space provides little 
area for recreational use or 
exercise, imposing physical and 
mental burdens onto those in 
the prison. Officials converted 
storage units into living areas 
and dismissed building codes 
so that, as one of the prisoners’ 
attorneys described, the prison 
was literally “bursting at the 
seams.”
Yet again and again when 
both inhabitants and outside 
investigators decry the facility, 
officials dismiss the concerns. 
Though the country is ostensibly 
pushing against the trend of 
mass incarceration that has 
been a fixture of the criminal 
justice system for decades, state 
policies are as primitive as they 
are resistant to change.
Federal changes to domestic 
incarceration policy only impact 
those in federal prisons, which 
does not make up a substantial 
portion of prisoners. Furthermore, 
these 
changes 
seem 
almost 
cosmetic when looking at the 
numbers. 
The 
prison 
system 
still groans under the weight of 
esoteric, racialized policies which 
place an emphasis on profiting off 
imprisoned bodies.
There are opportunities for 
Michigan to change, especially as 

recently sworn-in Gov. Gretchen 
Whitmer seeks political wins that 
have the potential for bipartisan 
support. Since 2007, the Michigan 
prison population has decreased 
from a record high of 51,000 to 
40,000 inmates. And though 
Huron Valley is ridden with 
problems, at the center of the 
issue is an overpopulation crisis 
which is hazardous for inmates 
and 
cumbersome 
for 
state 
bureaucrats to manage.
Policies that legislators and 
Whitmer 
could 
look 
at 
are 
occupational licensing, specifically 
reforming the current system 
in place that prevents those 
with 
criminal 
records 
from 
receiving a license that enables 
them to work in certain fields. 
Restrictions currently placed are 
indiscriminate, barring anyone 
with a criminal record from 
obtaining one even if the crime 
they committed is unrelated to 
the occupation in which they seek 
a license. This has the potential to 
reduce recidivism rates and enable 
more people to contribute to the 
Michigan economy.
Michigan lawmakers could also 
look into reforming the current 
bail system, which discriminately 
impacts 
low-income 
earners 
who cannot afford to pay the 
exorbitant bail costs imposed on 
them. Thousands of people remain 
in jails without charges simply 
because they cannot meet the set 
bail.
This is one of many problems 
facing the inmates of Huron 
Valley. 
The 
deteriorating 
infrastructure, 
past 
history 
of 
sexual 
assault 
and 
overpopulation 
due 
to 
the 
artificial increase in capacity 
has 
yielded 
wide-ranging 
consequences for inmates. The 
policing and prison policies in 
Michigan are still in dire need of 
reform, with change necessary 
for thousands of prisoners who 
are now becoming subject to 
human rights violations.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

It’s practically worn out in musical discourse to 
bemoan the “three-and-a-half-minute pop song,” 
usually in comparison (as a strawman) to a more 
complicated, underrated work. That concision 
and formalism are, in and of themselves, seen 
as worthy of disdain should seem strange to 
anyone who regularly listens to popular music 
— Irving Berlin’s acknowledged mastery was 
generally constricted to an almost formulaic 
32-bar structure, as were many of George 
Gershwin’s songs 
that later became 
jazz 
standards. 
Concision 
is 
the 
rule 
in 
songcraft, not the 
exception, 
and 
for good reason. 
A 
song 
is 
a 
perfect vessel for 
clear and concise 
expression 
that 
still 
retains 
the 
ability 
to 
accommodate 
complex 
emotions and a 
wide variety of 
styles. It makes 
sense that this 
form has endured 
to 
the 
present 
day much more 
than the intricate (and often opaque to first-time 
listeners) European symphonic forms.
Songs are also useful in that people rarely 
want to hear just one at a time. Some of the 
earliest examples of short-form composition are 
the 19th century “song cycles” by composers 
who also worked in the symphonic mode. Franz 
Schubert wrote two evening-length cycles for 
a vocalist with piano accompaniment parsed 
into small songs ranging from under a minute 
to around six minutes. Trying to tell a story 
with what is essentially a set of miniatures 
is an interesting musical problem — there’s a 
dialectic between continuity and subtlety. The 

song cycle contains many-faceted impressions 
rather than a continuous arc. Schubert’s songs 
are little snapshots of the main character’s 
emotional state, and some of the most poignant 
songs cut away from the narrative arc to focus on 
nature — the wind through the trees, a creaking 
weathervane.
This approach to songs — a narrative told 
through small elements — didn’t survive entirely 
intact in the emergence of the album a century 
later, but a lot of music criticism acknowledges 
that albums need some kind of flow that both 
acknowledges the separateness of the elements 
and links them together. This discontinuous 
continuity is hard to locate in any particular 
aspect of the music, a certain je ne sais quoi. 
To pick an example at random, a review of 
LCD Soundsystem’s “Sound Of Silver”: “We’re 
besieged and stupefied enough by downloads and 
mixes and remixes and mashups and collections 
of songs masquerading as albums that an album 
that feels like an album strikes me as positively 
ideal right now.”
It’s interesting that the reviewer mentions 
mixes and mashups — the mix, whether done 
in a continuous flow by a DJ or simply ripped 
onto a cassette or a CD, is somewhere between 
album and mashup. The mix splits albums at 
their weakest components and collages their 
component parts, creating a new large-scale 
form out of pre-existing parts.
The creator of the mixtape, in essence, is 
performing a “reading” of their particular 
musical landscape. Their task is to maximize 
a particular quality of music that they value 
independent of the artists’ original intentions — 
the creation of a personal genre that brings what 
they value in music to the forefront. A mixtape 
can be a sonic memory palace, a record not only 
of listening but listening in a particular way and 
with specific priorities. The role of the listener 
becomes active — it’s a process approaching that 
of the composer or the record producer, who 
draws on their store of auditory knowledge to 
create new things.
The “playlist” of the 2010s takes this logic of 
maximization as its lowest strata, but functions 
in a different way. Playlists, in their scale (it’s 
very easy to make playlists that are hours long) 
and ability to be updated and edited over time, 
have acquired something like a furnishing or 

decorative function, that of a lamp you can 
turn on and off. Playlists are created, in part, 
to fulfill some function: opening Spotify’s front 
page presents the listener with playlists that are 
tailored to a specific activity, like “deep focus” 
or “brain food.” The writer Liz Pelly writes on 
Spotify’s Muzak-esque attitude toward music 
in general. Playlists are curated according to 
genre and, increasingly, according to mood, 
“chill” prefacing a multitude of playlists. Pelly 
writes: “Spotify loves “chill” playlists: they’re 
the purest distillation of its ambition to turn 
all music into emotional wallpaper.” Pelly 
has similar misgivings about the “discovery” 
playlists Spotify offers, writing that streaming 
“creates passive environments where listeners 
stream what they like, and more of what they 
like, and more of what they like — ad nauseam.” 
This is the afterlife of the mixtape: The ability to 
create specific pathways through music culture 
as a whole is turned into a way to maximize the 
passive aspects of music listening.
Curation retains its creative potential, even as 
it threatens to pull the listener into an effective 
undertow. Is it possible that we could have 

seen this coming? Isn’t art made from other 
art one with an already essentially narcissistic 
relationship to the work of other artists? Mixtape 
culture was initially lauded as lifting the listener 
out of passivity 
and into a small 
act of creation. 
The question then 
becomes whether 
or not a society 
where 
everyone 
is encouraged to 
have a passively 
creative 
(and 
corporate-
mediated, 
in 
Spotify’s 
case) 
relationship 
with 
other 
art 
is 
desirable. 
Mixtapes 
were 
never meant to 
be the default way to engage with music, and a 
world where everyone exists in a lonely sea of 
their own taste was never the intention.

‘Mars Room,’ in portrait

I have a crush on Rachel 
Kushner — everything about 
her. 
I 
was 
initially 
turned 
on by her debut novel “The 
Flamethrowers,” a smart and 
stylish sojourn from the dirty art 
hoes of 1970s Soho to the political 
underground of Italy, complete 
with glamorous touches of DMT 
churches, performance art and 
street violence. Swoon.
“The Flamethrowers” is so 
vivid, so bitingly electric and 
feminist-without-the-word that 
I got curious about the woman 
behind the pen and slipped into 
a 
forty 
minute 
biographical 
research bender. Rachel Kushner 
is 
a 
San 
Francisco 
native, 
the certain spawn of beatnik 
scientists that lands a gig at a 
feminist bookstore at the ripe 
age of five, does the Berkeley 
thing and bools around the SF 
nightclub scene on her Moto 
Guzzi before casually saucing 
over to Columbia for her MFA. 
In author imagery, she often 
appears in front of cars, behind 
Wayfarers 
and/or 
clad 
in 
leather. She’s got three critically 
acclaimed blockbuster novels, a 
Guggenheim, an honorary PhD 
from Kalamazoo and now a spot 
on the Man Booker shortlist 
with her latest book, “The Mars 
Room.” I repeat: swoon.
“The Mars Room” reads much 

like “The Flamethrowers” in 
its grunge-glamor. Our femme 
fatale, Romy Hall, grew up 
hard and fast in San Francisco, 
getting into catfights and PCP 
on the weekends before working 
at The Mars Room, a low-fi
 
but high-cred strip club in the 
gritty Tenderloin district. It’s 
not a stereotypically secure gig, 
but Romy enjoys the power she 
wields at the club and a steady 
source of income to support 
herself and her son. She’s smart, 
pragmatic and tough (“Every 
stripper I know is clever. Some 
are practically geniuses.”), but 
she doesn’t have the ability to 
prevent or outrun a customer-
turned-stalker, and she really 
doesn’t 
have 
the 
cultural 
capital 
or 
capital-capital 
to 
defend herself at court when an 
encounter with the creep turns 
violent. But this is all delivered to 
us through sporadic flashbacks. 
The novel opens in the thick of 
consequence: 
Romy 
shackled 
chattel-style to a prison bus, 
careening nebulously into two 
consecutive life sentences in the 
Central Valley.
“The Mars Room” unfolds 
like 
this, 
unsticking 
and 
resticking in time between its 
present (2003 at the Stanville 
Women’s Correctional Facility) 
and Romy’s shrouded past on 
the streets of SF. Structurally, 
this can be unpopular territory: 
Novels that nix the frameworks 
of time and place run the risk of 

bleeding out into disorganized 
and 
disorienting 
masses 
of 
detail. Kushner, however, is a 
seasoned rebel. She manipulates 
the timeline so deftly that these 
scenes slide into each other 
with a dreamlike logic. Romy’s 
GED prep session at Stanville 
summons an anecdote of teaching 
her son to count, a memory that 
morphs into musing on how 
counting functions “like prison, 
from a name to a number.” This 
brings us back to Stanville where 
the women on death row are 
sewing sandbags for “five cents 
an hour, minus fifty-five percent 
restitution.” 
The narrative is a ride on 
Romy’s train of thought, a 
psychological portrait made vivid 
by its very meandering. Between 
the hustle for shampoo and 
tampons, hazy recollections of 
bad lap dances and dehumanizing 
treatment from prison guards 
and 
public 
defenders 
alike, 
Kushner captures the indefinite 
restlessness of a mind pinned 
between past and future, time 
and place, hope and regret. 
That being said, “The Mars 
Room” sprawls. Those who value 
plot will be frustrated with the 
way this one constantly wavers 
between 
absent 
and 
forced. 
Those who enjoy form and detail 
will revel in Kushner’s obsession 
with it, a highly visual approach 
to storytelling singular enough 
to land her on the Man Booker 
shortlist.

BOOK REVIEW

The first week of every 
semester is always a haze of 
casual inquiry. Why are you in 
this class? What do you do in 
your free time? Share a funny 
story with the person sitting 
next to you. It goes on and on. 
But in my Comm 102 class this 
week, the GSI asked a topically 
relevant question: What is your 
media guilty pleasure? The 
answers from my discussion 
full of sorority girls and frat 
boys was pretty similar across 
the board, from Instagram 
to Netflix to a minor FIFA 
addiction that made everyone 
laugh. For me, I realized that it 
was YouTube. And not just the 
classical version of YouTube, 
full of late-night clips and fail 
videos, but almost exclusively 
skincare and makeup taught by 
beautiful French (or similarly 
nonchalant) women. They’re 
calming in a way that I’ve never 
been able to put my finger 
on, and I definitely watch too 
much for it to be good on my 
eyes late at night. But there’s 
something 
indescribably 
soothing 
about 
applying 
serums and moisturizers in 
pace with a lilting European 
accent in the morning and 
before bed. I think it does the 
same thing for me that praying 
might do for someone else. 
Going through the motions of 
my skincare routine is a sort of 
ritual, an excuse to reflect on 
the day that has passed and the 
one ahead of me while keeping 
myself occupied.
Nonetheless, my love for 
beauty 
videos 
(specifically 
ones 
like 
those 
made 
by 
Violette, Into the Gloss and 
Christine Nguyen) is still a 
guilty pleasure. My friends 
make fun of me for the amount 
of products I have lined up 
hidden in drawers and on my 
desk, for the hours I probably 
spend watching these women 
meticulously 
apply 
their 
favorite creams and lipsticks 
every 
year. 
As 
I 
jokingly 
answered my instructor during 
discussion, I began to realize 
how much my little ritual really 
meant to me. When I look at my 
skincare habits fiscally, I am 

shocked and horrified by the 
potential hundreds of dollars 
that I’ve spent on product. 
But as a realist, there is some 
part of this spending that is 
an investment in myself that 
pays off. Not only is my skin 
fantastic (bar one very fun 
week every month), but I am 
also genuinely excited to do my 
routine twice a day. As a self-
declared workaholic, my ritual 
of beauty video play-alongs is 
sometimes the only thing I do 
outside of writing or reading 
all day. Everyone has their 
own little things that make 
them happy, and for me it’s 

the feeling of a fresh face, the 
stinging satisfaction of a peel 
or the faint taste of menthol as 
my lip balm sinks in.
In 
the 
morning, 
I 
roll 
out 
of 
bed 
to 
my 
birds-
and-piano 
alarm 
of 
Aphex 
Twin’s 
“aisatsana 
[102]” 
and subsequently settle into 
my desk chair, laying out 
the things I’ll need for the 
day. It’s a little “American 
Psycho” 
Patrick 
Bateman, 
but first; there are serums, 
then 
moisturizers 
mixed 
together to thwart pollution 
and 
dryness, 
sunscreen, 
makeup, highlighter and gel 
and hairspray. All the while, 
I love to throw on a video 
in 
the 
background 
there’s 
something uncanny about the 
effect of someone else making 
themselves up while you do, 
like a very chic friend sharing 
secrets before a night out. It 
doesn’t even have to be related 
what I’m doing, but knowing 
that by osmosis I might pick up 
a tip or two. Even a hint of the 
calm and collected demeanor 
of these women is enough 
to 
make 
these 
ten-minute 
intervals of peace and self-care 
in my busy life worth it.
The famed burlesque dancer 
and general beauty icon Dita 
Von Teese consistently brings 
up these moments in every 
interview I’ve ever seen her 
give. To Von Teese, the thrill of 
making yourself into something 
beautiful, something different 
than yourself and full of joyful 
glamour. Like her, I find my 
own joy in going through the 
steps of my preparations for 
the day, in making myself 
into whatever I want to be 
at any given moment. The 
consolation of other women 
in that process via YouTube or 
a podcast or even in real life 
makes those moments even 
more powerful and effective 
than they would be alone. It 
may be a guilty pleasure, but it 
is pleasure nonetheless, a small 
happiness in an oft-stressful 
and clustered world. If I spend 
80 dollars on Vitamin C, so be 
it: There is no price to comfort 
and confidence.

“I Get No Joy”

Jade Bird

Glassnote Records

SINGLE REVIEW: ‘I GET NO JOY’

We’re only two weeks into 
2019, but already it’s shaping 
up to be a huge year for British 
singer-songwriter Jade Bird. 
She recently announced the 
official release date for her 
self-titled debut album, the 
anticipation of which has been 
bolstered by one high-quality 
single after another. Her new 
single, “I Get No Joy,” was 
released in tandem with the 
more razor-edged “Uh Huh” 
and “Love Has All Been Done 
Before,” and hints at a fresh 
frustration and yearning that 
feels true, even this early on, 
for an artist like Bird.
The premise of the song is 
an interesting take from Bird, 
who, upon first glance, seems 
able to derive joy from almost 
anything, whether it’s the joy 
of embarking upon her first 

major tours or that of recording 
her first full-length album. But 
Bird’s music itself runs the full 
gamut of self-consciousness, 

from the questioning nature 
of a troubled relationship in 
“Love Has All Been Done 
Before” to the righteous self-
awareness of “Good Woman” 
from her debut EP, Something 
American. “I Get No Joy” turns 
this critical eye to her artwork, 
bursting with a frustration 
and a specific creative drive 
that harkens back to Alanis 

Morissette hits like “Right 
Through 
You.” 
Wielding 
the moody electric guitar 
that is swiftly becoming her 
trademark, 
Bird 
questions 
herself and others with lines 
like, 
“Electric, 
connected, 
unexpectedly 
affected 
/ 
What do you need? What do 
you need? / I get no joy.” Her 
optimism peeks through with 
the 
almost-murmured 
line, 
“I know the sun will shine / 
Another day, another time,” 
which expertly leads the song 
toward its close. “I Get No 
Joy” feels like a new branch for 
Bird in terms of subject matter, 
and that it speaks well of her 
upcoming album’s potential at 
this point comes as no surprise.
— Laura Dzubay, Daily Arts 
Writer

“It’s not saturated. It’s not going to look 
colorful. It’s going to be very subdued. 
Sometimes, it’s not as pretty as you want it to 
be,” says Waldemar Centeno (“The Goldbergs”). 
He’s talking about the look and feel of one 
of his recent projects as a film editor: Jason 
Orley’s (“The Intern”) “Big Time Adolescence,” 
a coming-of-age comedy starring Pete Davidson 
(“Saturday Night Live”) and Griffin Gluck 
(“American Vandal”). The film has been selected 
to premiere later this month at Sundance Film 
Festival as part of the U.S. dramatic competition.
I spoke with Centeno about “Big Time 
Adolescence” for upward of 45 minutes. Not 
once did he assume personal credit for the 
festival honor —or for any aspect of the film, for 
that matter.
He recounted the day he found out about the 
film’s selection for the festival. He remembers 
hearing it from Orley, who “with a very stoic 
face, just said, ‘We got the call. We got into 
Sundance.’” Centeno explained the personal 
significance of that moment, admitting, “I won’t 
lie to you: It has been 13 years of really hard work 
to even get the phone call to work on a project 
starring Pete Davidson, but I obviously kind of 
teared up, and gave him (Orley) a hug. You know, 
I went home, and pretty much cried for a whole 
night.” But he also spoke to what it means for 
the entire team involved, whom he got to know 
while cutting the film on set: “We were shooting 
for that (the Sundance recognition). It wasn’t 
expected, but we’re really excited as a group.”
Even when I gave Centeno a premium 
opportunity to foreground his contributions 
to “Big Time Adolescence” in asking about the 
particular role he played as editor, he refused, 
and instead underscored the collaboration 
necessary for effective storytelling in film. 
Centeno praised the performances of the cast: 
“As an editor, that’s all you really want, some 
really great acting, so you can actually do your 
job.” He added, “I was always told as I was 
coming up as an editor, working as a technician 
and running the edit is just twenty percent of the 

work. 80 percent 
of 
it 
is 
the 
camaraderie that 
you 
have 
with 
the person you’re 
working 
with 
when I’m giving 
feedback, it’s not 
that I go, ‘This 
is how I want 
it.’ I go, ‘This is 
the 
way 
Jason 
(the director) is 
envisioning going 
forward.’”
This 
vision 
centers 
on 
the 
friendship 
of 
teenage 
Mo 
(Gluck) 
and 
twentysomething 
Zeke (Davidson), 
and 
the 
strain 
that 
helpless 
matters 
like 
age 
difference 
and growing up 
puts 
on 
their 
relationship over 
time. 
Centeno 
told me that this 
story is “close to the heart” and named the aspect 
of the story that he found most persuasive: “It’s 
about an outsider, essentially, that thinks he’s 
an insider, but then ends up being shunned later 
on in the story. I grew up on the East Coast, 
understanding this type of person that was the 
page … that’s what drew me to it.”
Of course, with Davidson and Gluck playing 
the lead roles, the film foregrounds male 
companionship. I pressed him about that, and, to 
my surprise and delight, Centeno did not plead 
the Fifth, regurgitate a rehearsed response 
or dodge the crucial, oft-dodged question of 
representation on screen. Instead, he answered 
the question directly and thoughtfully and did 
not feel the need to go on the offensive when 
supplying a counterpoint. He assented that the 
film “does center on these two male companions 

and some of their friends that are male,” but 
clarified, “Since the beginning of our screenings 
of this, we really wanted to make it a point to talk 
about this: How do people feel about the women 
in this movie?” He then added, “there are three 
women in the movie who really shine. They play 
these three really strong female characters that 
are entwined with Zeke and Mo’s life. They have 
some powerful moments. They’re not just there 
to let the boys do whatever they want. They’re 
there to make sure they speak up for what’s 
right,” and are able to “speak for themselves.”
As 
a 
coming-of-age 
film, 
“Big 
Time 
Adolescence” also situates itself in a genre that 
never sees a shortage of films and that has, as 
of late, seen an increase in representation of 
marginalized voices and experiences. Pressed a 
second time, Centeno was once more refreshingly 
direct and earnest with his answer. “We still 
have a long way to go in the film industry,” he 
recognized, in terms of honoring diversity and 
tipping the scales of representation. But he 
pointed out another important dimension of 
diversity that lies in the storytellers themselves, 
commenting, “There is diversity in the people 
that worked on it (“Big Time Adolescence”),” and 
drawing on his own experience as an example. 
“I’m Puerto Rican, and a Puerto Rican editor, I 
was able to give my insight on something that 
was not necessarily of my culture. I was able to 
say, ‘No, that’s not the way you should say that. 
There’s a better way to say this.’”
In 
terms 
of 
what 
makes 
“Big 
Time 
Adolescence” stand out in a crowded genre, 
Centeno 
highlighted 
the 
unique 
interplay 
between comedy and drama at work in the film. 
“The way we looked at it was a comedy where 
we would try not to heighten the comedy; 
we’d heighten the drama,” Centeno explained, 
“because Pete Davidson’s story is a cautionary 
tale of this older kid who befriends this younger 
kid and thinks they’re really good friends and 
will be for a very long time. But at some point, 
people get grown out of.” Elaborating on what 
it meant to heighten the drama in the context of 
a comedy, Centeno contrasted the unremitting 
speed of some comedies to the more measured 
pace of “Big Time Adolescence.” “That’s 
essentially what we did: we lived in those 
moments” — meaning the slower, dramatic 
scenes in the film — “instead of trying to get to 
the next joke.” Centeno distinguished the breed 
of comedy that emerges from this sensitivity 
from the network comedies he has cut in the 
past, calling it “a very real, natural, dirty 
comedy that a network show would never be.” 

The anchor of the comedic dimension of “Big 
Time Adolescence” is, according to Centeno, 
Pete Davidson. He called Davidson “one of the 
driving forces of the comedy,” and indicated that 
“the way he acted really drew the comedy out of 
everybody else.” As a bonus, however, Centeno 
believes the film will also show audiences 
Davidson “has a lot of depth in him,” as do “all 
the other characters.”
At that point in the conversation, we had hit 
the 40-minute mark. For my last question, I 
asked if Centeno wanted to say anything about 
his experience at the University as an alumnus 
and former sports writer for The Michigan 
Daily. After narrating his jagged trajectory 
toward undergraduate degrees in English and 
film, he remarked, “I always tell people I did 
storytelling as a major.” After elaborating on 
his investment in storytelling at the University 
and The Daily, I posed my standard, “Is there 
anything else you’d like to add?” Centeno’s reply 
was one of the last things I would ever expect an 
interviewee to say to an interviewer: He told me 
he would like to hear about my experience at the 
University and The Daily.
Pleasantly 
surprised for the 
third 
distinct 
time, I began to 
ramble about my 
love of The Daily 
and my inability 
to 
declare 
a 
major; 
Centeno 
listened patiently 
and 
responded 
thoughtfully. 
When 
I 
finally 
stopped 
talking 
and let Centeno 
go, 
I 
returned 
to what Centeno 
had 
said 
about 
majoring 
in 
storytelling. 
Because 
in 
my 
rambling, 
I 
had 
responded 
to 
Centeno 
as 
though he were 
someone I could 
unhesitatingly 
trust 
with 
my 
story — as though 
I’d been speaking 
with a storyteller.

I

mitation is the sincerest 
form of flattery, so goes the 
saying.
The Michigan hockey team 
currently finds itself in the mid-
dle of the pack. 
Five points from 
the top of the 
Big Ten and, 
likewise, five 
points from the 
bottom. Sit-
ting at 27th in 
the Pairwise 
rankings, the 
Wolverines will 
need all hands 
on deck to make 
a postseason push.
Last season, Michigan was 
reeling heading into the second 
half of the season. They were 
well out of the NCAA Tourna-
ment picture and a birth in the 
tournament seemed improbable.
And as if this season couldn’t 
get any more similar to last sea-
son, the Wolverines are losing 
one of their top offensive threats 
to an injury sustained in the 
World Junior Championship.
Again.
After Tuesday’s practice this 
week, Michigan hockey coach 
Mel Pearson said he’s a “glass-
half-full kind of guy.” Perhaps 
his mind was already on the 
impending absence of his star 
forward, Josh Norris. Moving 
forward, the 
team will have to 
employ that sort 
of mentality.
The news 
wasn’t officially 
released until 
this morning: 
Norris will 
undergo surgery 
and miss the 
remainder of the 
season with an 
undisclosed injury.
The sophomore is second on 
the team in points and tied for 
first in goals despite missing the 
past six games. He is arguably 
the team’s best pure scorer and 
makes a difference every time 

he steps on the ice –– see Nor-
ris’ performance against Lake 
Superior State. He was having a 
breakout season: Norris eclipsed 
his goal total from last season 
and sits just four points behind 
his freshman year’s point total 
in less than half as many games 
played.
And now, the Wolverines 
must prepare for life without 
Norris. But don’t panic –– Mich-
igan has been here before.
Last season, then-sophomore 
forward Will Lockwood missed 
the second half of the season 
after suffering a left shoulder 
injury in an outdoor game 
against Canada while repre-
senting Team USA. He was a 
key offensive contributor while 
healthy in his first two seasons 
with the Wolverines. In 16 
games last season, he tallied 
four goals and seven assists. As a 
freshman, he finished second on 
the team in points with 20.
“There’s just a lot of scary 
similarities with this year and 
last year,” said junior forward 
Nick Pastujov. “You lose a guy 
in World Juniors, we come back 
after Christmas with a couple 
big wins against Ohio State and 
Notre Dame this year compared 
to a couple wins against Notre 
Dame last year.”
Michigan’s season has been so 
similar to last season already, it’s 
almost humor-
ous.
So, if there is 
any silver lining, 
many of the lead-
ers on the team 
have experienced 
what it’s like to 
find success after 
losing one of 
their top offen-
sive weapons.
“I think one 
of the main teaching tools you 
get off of it is that there’s still a 
lot of season left,” Pearson said 
before today’s practice on the 
lessons learned from last sea-
son’s experience. “The team still 
can have success even though 

you might not have one of your 
main characters involved, you 
can still have a rewarding sea-
son, and that you can still reach 
your goals.”
It’s almost as though the 
Wolverines this 
season are inad-
vertently paying 
homage to last 
season’s roller 
coaster. Some 
of the similari-
ties –– such as 
the injuries 
–– are out of the 
team’s control 
and, rather, are 
a result of poor 
luck. But others –– erratic goal-
tending amplified by the team’s 
mediocrity through the halfway 
point of the season and signa-
ture conference wins early in 
the second half –– are a result 
of player performance and give 

fans and team members, alike, a 
sense of déjà vu.
“We went through it last year, 
I guess that’s the other thing 
that we can look back upon,” 
Pearson said. “It’s a little déjà 
vu, same situa-
tion. We have a 
player go to the 
World Juniors, 
gets hurt, out for 
the year. We’ve 
seen this act 
before, and we’re 
just gonna have 
to follow the 
same script this 
year.”
Consider it an 
impromptu encore of sorts.
If there is one form of consis-
tency Michigan has shown this 
season, it is found in inadver-
tently following that same script 
from last year. Once again, it is 
losing one of its “main charac-

ters,” as Pearson put it, for the 
second half of the season.
And that script that Pearson 
hopes to follow was a collec-
tive effort. Last season, then-
freshman forward Jack Becker 
increased his point total from 
zero to eight in the second half 
of the season. Another player 
who must continue to make an 
impact this season is junior for-
ward Nick Pastujov. He is cur-
rently tied with Norris for the 
most goals on the team — more 
than doubling his goal total from 
last season — and has appeared 
on the top line alongside Lock-
wood in the absence of Norris.
“I think all four lines need 
to kind of dial it in like we did 
last year where coach could 
kind of put out any line against 
any matchup,” Pastujov said. “I 
think all the lines need to kind 
of step up there.
“So, I think it’s just one of 

those things where we have 
to stay on the right path, don’t 
really get too discouraged about 
it. We’ve seen what we can do 
when we play good teams. I real-
ly don’t think there’s no reason 
we can’t make the same run we 
did last year.”
Winning at Notre Dame 
and Ohio State without Norris 
showed what the Wolverines 
are capable of doing moving for-
ward. Michigan already faced an 
uphill climb to make it into the 
NCAA Tournament.
But they’ve been here before.
“We don’t know, we don’t 
know what the ending is going 
to be,” Pearson said. “We have 
a choice to make sure we do 
everything we can to make it a 
storybook ending.”

Behind Enemy Lines: The Daily sits down with Wisconsin’s Ethan Happ

On Saturday, the Michigan 
men’s basketball team (17-0 
overall, 6-0 Big Ten) will face 
one of its biggest challenges 
in Big Ten play when it takes 
on Wisconsin (11-6, 3-3) at the 
Kohl Center in Madison.
The Badgers were among 
the conference’s 
most impressive 
teams 
early 
in the season, 
notching 
non-
conference wins 
over Oklahoma 
and 
North 
Carolina 
State, 
and 
opening 
Big 
Ten 
play 
with a win at 
Iowa. They have 
encountered a rough stretch 
since 
then, 
dropping 
their 
final game of 2018 to Western 
Kentucky before losing three 
of four to start the new year 
— 
including 
home 
losses 
to 
Minnesota 
and 
Purdue. 
They also fell just short in a 
comeback attempt at No. 19 
Maryland on Monday.
Still, though, it’s a marked 

improvement from last season 
for Wisconsin, who went 15-18 
in 2017-18 and missed the 
NCAA Tournament for the first 
time in 20 years. If the Badgers 
return to postseason play this 
season, it will be on the back 
of fifth-year senior forward 
Ethan Happ, a two-time All-
Big Ten selection. The Daily 
sat down with Happ at Big Ten 
Media 
Day 
in 
October.
The 
Michigan 
Daily: Is there 
a 
different 
attitude in the 
team this year 
coming off the 
down year than 
there was last 
year or the year 
before that?
Ethan Happ: Yeah, we know 
how far away we were. It’s not 
like we were right there at the 
NCAA tournament mark, we 
were far away, and we know 
how much we have to improve. 
And last year, it’s not like 
we expected to be good, but 
we almost took for granted 
the little things that made 
Wisconsin so good every year, 

year in and year out. So, I think 
this year, we’re not taking 
anything for granted and we’re 
just gonna grind in practice and 
try to make the season the best 
one that we’ve had in a while.
TMD: So how do you close 
that bigger gap between where 
you were last year compared to 
the years before that?
Happ: Defensively is the 
biggest thing. You could tell, for 
the last five years or whatever, 
we were a great defensive 
team, except for last year. Even 
within the season, the whole 
first half of the season, we 
weren’t good. Then, we got a 
little bit better, and then when 
we started actually winning 
games toward the end of the 
year, that’s when we really 
locked in and became a pretty 
good defensive team. So that’s 
just a major — it goes hand in 
hand with us being in the win 
column more often.
TMD: How has the program 
changed since the first half of 
your freshman year when Bo 
Ryan was here?
Happ: The program itself 
hasn’t changed. We still have 
the same principles, the same 
selfless attitude that you need 

in any Wisconsin program. 
But there are differences from 
coach to coach. But I think the 
main thing is with the players, 
that 
we 
just 
want to preserve 
the 
culture 
that’s 
been 
at 
Wisconsin. 
To 
answer 
your 
question, I don’t 
think there has 
been a lot of 
change. We just 
need to get back 
to 
where 
we 
have been.
TMD: 
What 
led you to eventually take your 
name out of the NBA draft last 
year?
Happ: A couple of things. 

One, the feedback I got from 
teams, they thought I’d benefit 
from another year. But also, 
just the way we ended last 
season, I didn’t 
want that to be 
my last season 
at 
Wisconsin. 
So hopefully we 
end this on a lot 
better note and 
go out the right 
way.
TMD: 
What 
feedback 
did 
they give you?
Happ: 
The 
most unanimous 
things 
were 
free 
throw 
percentage has to improve and 
then, being able to space the 
floor with, like, a 15-foot jump 

shot. Those are big things for 
teams to move me higher up 
on their boards. They said I 
was an elite ball handler for 
my side, finisher, passer. They 
just need to see that to move up 
higher on their boards.
TMD: Have you used that 
feedback to help you mentor 
the younger guys on the team 
on what NBA teams are looking 
for?
Happ: Not especially on 
what NBA teams are looking 
for. I’m just more putting the 
NBA in the background right 
now, just trying to focus on 
how Wisconsin can be the best 
team. Luckily, there are things 
that can be mutually beneficial 
for myself making it to the next 
level, but also for Wisconsin.

Norris out for season with undisclosed injury

Josh Norris — a sophomore 
forward 
who 
ranks 
second 
on the Michigan hockey team 
in points — will miss the 
remainder of the season, the 
team 
announced 
Thursday 
morning. 
Norris 
sustained 
an 
undisclosed injury at the 2019 
World 
Junior 
Championships 
earlier 
this 
month and has 
not dressed for 
the Wolverines 
since returning 
from 
the 
tournament. 
His injury will 
require season-
ending surgery. 
“It’s 
disappointing to have my season 
end and I’m going to miss being 
on the ice with my teammates 
every day, but it’s something 
that I have to take care of,” 
Norris said in a statement. “I 
am looking forward to working 
hard during rehab and am 
excited to get back on the ice. 
I’m going to be here supporting 
my teammates throughout the 
rest of the season and wish them 
the best of luck.” 
Norris’ 10 goals through the 
first part of the season is tied 
for first on the team with junior 
forward Nick Pastujov. His 19 
total points rank second behind 
sophomore defenseman Quinn 
Hughes, who has three goals 
and a team-leading 19 assists for 
a total of 22 points. 
Prior to the World Juniors, 
Norris 
centered 
Michigan’s 
top line and was leading the 
team in points. He was the 19th 
overall pick in the 2017 NHL 
Entry Draft by the San Jose 
Sharks, though his rights have 
since been traded to the Ottawa 
Senators. 
“I feel bad for Josh. He 
was 
having 
an 
outstanding 
season,” said Michigan coach 

Mel Pearson in a statement. 
“Knowing him, he will work 
extremely hard to come back 
stronger and become an even 
better player. We look forward 
to having Josh continue to be a 
part of our team this season.” 
Both Pearson and Norris’ 
comments left the idea of 
whether Norris will be back 
with the Wolverines next season 
or sign with Ottawa open to 
interpretation, 
though Pearson 
said 
Thursday 
that he expects 
Norris to be back 
next year.
“We’ve 
had 
some 
conversations 
prior 
to 
the 
injury,” Pearson 
said 
Thursday 
in 
his 
office. 
“We haven’t discussed any of 
that since the injury because 
we want to focus him on getting 
healthy and that. But I do (think 
he’ll be back). Now, having said 
that, he might, he might not be. 
I mean, he’ll have options. We’ll 
just see how that plays out, how 
his recovery goes and how he 

thinks. What he wants to do.”
Moving forward, Michigan 
must find a replacement for 
Norris. It’s hard to replace him 
with just one player — and the 
Wolverines aren’t planning to 
try to do that.
But 
since 
they’ve 
been 
without him for six games 
already, Pearson has a better idea 
of what the team might look like 
in his absence. In the six games 
without Norris, 
Michigan posted 
a 2-2-2 record, 
including 
two 
road wins over 
top-15 teams in 
wins at No. 4 
Ohio State and 
No. 
12 
Notre 
Dame.
“In that six 
games, I liked 
a lot of things 
without him,” Pearson said. “So, 
we’ve already played without 
him. I think that’s a key. If all 
of the sudden we just found out 
today, you’re going into a big 
weekend and wow, you don’t 
have him, then there’s a little 
more, I think, panic or concern. 
Because of that, I think we’ll be 

in good shape. You don’t replace 
— no one’s going to step up and 
replace a player like (Norris), 
especially how well he was 
playing.”
And though Norris is the 
second Wolverine in two years 
to miss the second half of the 
year 
after 
a 
season-ending 
injury at the World Juniors — 
junior forward Will Lockwood 
saw his sophomore campaign 
cut short after a 
shoulder injury 
last 
year 
— 
Pearson doesn’t 
plan 
to 
stop 
allowing players 
to 
attend 
the 
tournament.
“There’s 
some concern,” 
Pearson 
said. 
“But 
we’ve 
done it for years 
here at Michigan and I guess 
our stance is we’ll always do 
whatever we can to support 
U.S. 
hockey 
and 
especially 
the World Junior team, the 
World Championship team. If 
we have players that have the 
opportunity to play there, then 
we’ll continue to support that.”

Sophomore forward Josh Norris will miss the remainder of the season after sustaining an undisclosed injury.

‘M’ falls to Iowa, 75-61

Thursday night, the Michigan 
women’s basketball team looked 
to get its first road conference 
win of the season.
That was set to be a tall task 
as the Wolverines were slated 
against No. 22 Iowa — a squad 
led by forward Megan Gustafson, 
the nation’s leading scorer — but 
despite the odds Michigan trailed 
by just three points at halftime.
After the break, though, the 
Hawkeyes turned it up a notch. 
They started to push the tempo 
and saw results. Fewer than 
three minutes into the quarter, 
they drained a triple from the left 
corner to make it a 10-0 run.
The 
Wolverines 
called 
a 
timeout but never recovered. 
Iowa (13-4 overall, 4-2 Big 
Ten) widened the gap, handing 
Michigan (11-7, 2-4) a 75-61 loss 
— the team’s fourth loss in its last 
six games.
“Through our growth process 
and through our improvement 
is the decision-making when 
other teams are going on a run,” 
said Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico to WTKA. “… We called a 
timeout. We tried to regroup, 
I mean, we had a better fourth 
quarter but we were down a little 
bit. And we scored in the fourth 
quarter; we just couldn’t get the 
stops that we needed to get.”
Contrary to recent games, ball 
handling wasn’t an issue. Prior 
to the game, the Wolverines 
averaged 
a 
whopping 
16.7 
turnovers per contest, but against 
the Hawkeyes, they lost the ball 
just seven times.
Rebounding was not alarming 
either. Michigan was outmatched 
by just four boards while the 
team actually won the battle for 
offensive rebounds.
Shooting, however, was a key 
problem. The Wolverines went 
1-for-15 from beyond the arc, 
with the lone 3-pointer coming at 
the start of the final quarter.
The Hawkeyes, on the other 

hand, 
excelled 
at 
shooting. 
Michigan often double-teamed 
Gustafson, but that left her 
teammates open. They finished 
the game shooting 57.6 percent 
from the field — a step up from 
Michigan’s 41.8 percent.
“We miss a lot of shots and we 
gotta get better at finishing some 
of those shots too,” Barnes Arico 
said. “And then we gotta get some 
key stops when we need to, and I 
think we need to understand the 
sense of urgency with that.”
The game was set to be a battle 
between senior center Hallie 
Thome and Gustafson.
Gustafson had the upper-hand 
to start the game. She scored from 
under the basket on her team’s 
first offensive possession and 
then further imposed her will 
by blocking Thome on the other 
end. Thome would fight back, but 
Gustafson still led her team with 
21 points and 16 rebounds.
Iowa’s guards added to the 
offensive clinic, showing off their 
ability to attack the basket early. 
This — coupled with Gustafson’s 
success — helped the Hawkeyes 
establish a five-point lead a few 
minutes into the contest.
Freshman 
forward 
Naz 
Hillmon 
soon 
checked 
in, 
though. She missed a shot from 
close right away, but got her 
own rebound and capitalized on 
the second-chance opportunity 
to give her team a spark. She 
finished with a team-high 16 
points.
Less than a minute later, 
Hillmon dove to the floor to win 
a loose ball around midcourt. 
This led to a bucket from junior 
forward Kayla Robbins.
Sophomore 
guard 
Deja 
Church then followed suit. She 
immediately stole the ball near 
midcourt and took it to the basket 
to give her team a 16-10 lead.
But the Hawkeyes countered 
with a 6-0 run to tie the game at 
the end of the opening frame. The 
remainder of the first half was a 
balanced affair, but ultimately, it 
wouldn’t matter.

The previously untold story of Zavier Simpson’s recruitment to Wisconsin

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

ANNIE KLUS/Daily
Junior guard Zavier Simpson was recruited by Wisconsin before committing to play basketball for Michigan.

On Saturday afternoon, the 
Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 
team will stake its claim to be 
the nation’s top-ranked team 
for the first time in half a 
decade.
If it does, Zavier Simpson 
will have helped the Wolverines 
defeat the school he almost 
attended.
It 
seems 
impossible 
to 
imagine now — with Michigan’s 
and 
Simpson’s 
identities 
inextricably intertwined — but 
four years ago, the pair had 
barely crossed each other’s 
radars. 
The 
Wolverines’ 
recruiting efforts were centered 
around 
now-Michigan 
State 
point guard Cassius Winston 
and, as a result, Simpson had 
yet to even consider Michigan.
Instead, the junior point 
guard 
seemed 
destined 
for 
Wisconsin. Now, four years 

later, neither Quincey Simpson 
— Zavier’s father and AAU 
coach — nor Lamont Paris, the 
assistant coach who nearly 
recruited him to Madison, can 
recall which major conference 
school was the first to enter 
Simpson’s recruitment.
The consensus? It wasn’t 
Michigan.
It may have been Wisconsin, 
but Quincey also remembers 
Illinois 
and 
Northwestern 
heavily pursuing his son at the 
time. The Badgers, though, 
were the most comfortable 
option for the Simpsons. Paris 
and Quincey grew up just 30 
minutes apart — Quincey in 
Lima, Ohio, where he raised 
Zavier, and Paris in Findlay, 
just 35 miles up the road. They 
got to know each other in the 
early 90s, facing each other 
in high school basketball, and 
have maintained a relationship 
ever since.
So 
when 
Paris 
began 

recruiting Zavier, it was a 
natural fit for both.
“It was an easy conversation,” 
Quincey 
told 
The 
Daily. 
“Because, like I said, he’s from 
Findlay 
and 
we’ve 
known 
each other. So it was really 
comfortable talking to him. 
But I do remember when that 
process 
started. 
They 
just 
reached out to me and we just 
kind of built a relationship and 
we built a rapport.”
“I first knew (Quincey) and 
then I saw Zavier was coming 
up and was a good player,” 
Paris, now the head coach at 
Chattanooga, 
added. 
“And 
I knew where he had been 
recruited and what kinds of 
schools were recruiting him. 
It probably was, originally, not 
at the Big Ten level, which, we 
didn’t care that much about. I 
just knew he was a good kid and 
a good solid player and a good 
leader.”
Quincey, though, knew not 

to magnify the importance 
of previous relationships, or 
which school offered when. 

A former Division II player 
himself, he instead advised 
Zavier to concern himself with 
fit and development — two 
boxes which Wisconsin ticked 
just as well.
“It was intriguing because 
Wisconsin has been known 
for the way that they develop 
players,” Quincey said. “And so, 
seeing some of the guards that 
they have had 
in the program, 
we were really 
happy that they 
were 
keying 
on 
my 
son’s 
recruiting.”
Then, 
the 
summer 
after 
Simpson’s 
junior 
year 
of 
high 
school, 
everything 
abruptly changed. A friend of 
Quincey’s was a scout and told 
him that both Michigan and 
Michigan State were heavily 
pursuing 
Cassius 
Winston. 
Whoever didn’t get Winston, 
he explained, would be left 
without a point guard.
Quincey knew the Spartans 
coaching staff through an old 

AAU player of his, but had no 
previous 
relationship 
with 
Wolverines coach John Beilein 

or his staff. Still, he reached 
out to then-assistant Bacari 
Alexander to gauge Michigan’s 
interest. Soon, both Alexander 
and Beilein began showing 
up to Simpson’s AAU games. 
Beilein, though, acknowledged 
that his interest in Simpson 
was dependent on Winston’s 
decision.
“He just said, ‘Hey, if I ever 
get 
the 
sense 
that I may not 
get 
(Winston), 
then I’m gonna 
go in hard with 
(Zavier).’ 
And 
we 
understood 
that,” 
Quincey 
said. “Most kids 
probably would 
take that as a 
diss, 
we 
took 
that 
as 
being 
honest, and we respected that.”
But soon after the Wolverines 
started pursuing Simpson, it 
became clear that Winston was 
destined for East Lansing. So 
only one week after using one 
of their five official visits with 
Wisconsin 
that 
September, 
Quincey and Zavier hit the road 
for what would become the first 

of countless drives up I-75 to 
Ann Arbor.
It took less than half the 

visit for Quincey to be sold on 
Michigan, but he didn’t want to 
force a decision on Zavier. A few 
hours later, on the drive home, 
he found out he didn’t have to. 
Zavier was ready to commit.
“We always kept a pros and 
cons list for every school,” 
Quincey said. “And there were 
absolutely no cons when we 
visited Michigan. Every box 
was checked, so there was 
nothing else to wait around 
for.”
Within 
days, 
Simpson’s 
commitment 
was 
official, 
stunning the Badgers — and 
every other school that had 
pursued him.
“I hadn’t heard Michigan that 
much,” Paris said. “I had heard 
a couple other schools, but I had 
not heard Michigan so that was 
kind of out of nowhere.”
Then, 
Paris 
paused 
and 
took a moment to reflect on 
Simpson’s recruitment process 
— something he hasn’t done in 
years. 
“Anyway, it works out how 
it’s supposed to work out.”
Three 
years 
on, 
the 
Wolverines 
can 
have 
no 
disagreements.
