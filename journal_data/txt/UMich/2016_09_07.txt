Starting at the beginning 

of 
classes 
Tuesday, 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan’s 

two-year-long 
transition 

to Canvas was complete — 
drawing mixed reactions from 
faculty over the process and 
implementation, and overall 
positive 
impressions 
from 

students.

Canvas 
is 
an 
online 

learning management system 
that includes features such 
as assignments, grades and 
discussion 
boards. 
Moving 

forward, it will be the class 
platform for all University 

classes, 
replacing 
CTools. 

The switch is one part of the 
University’s NextGen plan — 
a strategy for investing in the 
next generation of technology 
and 
creating 
shared 

infrastructure across campus.

The 
University 
piloted 

Canvas 
in 
the 
2014-2015 

school year with lukewarm 
responses from faculty and 
students, using it in 130 
courses and engaging more 
than 10,000 students and 
150 instructors. The decision 
to move forward with the 
transition was motivated by 
a decided need to, once the 
transition had begun, reduce 

At their meeting Tuesday, 

City Council voted 8-3 to 
approve the proposed and 
long-delayed Woodbury Club 
Apartment project three years 
after it was first brought before 
the council for approval.

The 
Woodbury 
project, 

slated to be built on the 
southeast corner of Nixon 
Road and M-14 near North 
Campus, was introduced in 
2013. However, approval has 
been consistently delayed due 
to pushback from neighboring 
residents concerned about the 
potential ecological damage to 
nearby wetlands and increased 
flooding risk.

Dozens of city residents 

living 
in 
neighborhoods 

adjacent 
to 
the 
proposed 

development 
attended 

Tuesday’s 
City 
Council 

meeting to advocate against 
the 
project 
— 
a 
regular 

occurrence whenever a vote to 
approve the project has been 
brought before the council for 
debate in the past.

Along 
with 
ecological 

concerns, opponents to the 
project expressed frustration 
with a perceived lack of effort 
by 
the 
project’s 
developer 

in 
engaging 
neighboring 

residents and the potential 
for 
overcrowding 
schools. 

They also pointed to a lack 
of 
accessibility 
to 
public 

transportation 
from 
the 

proposed apartments, which 
they 
said 
could 
lead 
to 

increased traffic congestion.

Ann Arbor resident Jane 

Kingston reiterated concerns 
expressed by many of her 
neighbors, saying the proposed 
project will damage the nearby 
wetlands and increase the risk 

of flooding.

“I’m really sad, and kind 

of mad and kind of frustrated 
that I’m here again to try and 
argue the case for this issue,” 
Kingston said. “We’ve been 
told by consultants and the 
people in the area that the 
parkland that’s there, as well 

as the properties nearby will 
be negatively damaged in a 
manner that is dramatic and 
severe. We’re not talking about 
just a little bit of development 
impact, we’re talking about 
damage in a manner that is not 
reversible.”

The South University Avenue 

business district is preparing to 
undergo a 10-story change.

Hughes 
Properties 
is 

working with Hobbs + Black 
Architects to construct a new 
student housing building near 
the intersection of the Diag and 
South University. The building 
will offer a combination of 
four-, 
five- 
and 
six-person 

bedrooms to appeal to a wide 
range of students, and it will 
include commercial spaces on 
the ground floor.

It will replace a few buildings 

along the north side of South 
University 
between 
Church 

Street 
and 
East 
University 

Avenue, 
though 
Espresso 

Royale and TCF Bank will 
remain standing.

Over the past years, high-

rises such as these have been 
controversial, 
with 
students 

pointing to them as one of many 
examples of unaffordable rent 
downtown.

The cost to rent in the 

South U. building has not 
been 
disclosed. 
However,

E. Royster Harper, vice president for student life, addresses the students of the Central Student Government about her wishes for the coming school year at the CSG 
meeting in the Michigan Union Tuesday.

Central Student Government 

President David Schafer, an LSA 
senior, spoke to the body about 
issues ranging from diversity to 
mental health support on campus 

at their first meeting of the 
semester on Tuesday,

Schafer specifically highlighted 

the need to increase the number 
of staff members in Counseling 
and 
Psychological 
Services, 

noting that four more full-time 
members have already been added 
after discussions between CSG 

and University Provost Martha 
Pollack.

“Last year the ratio stood 1 to 

14,000 and now it should be down 
to about 1 to 1,150 to 1 to 1,200,” 
Schafer said. “Obviously there’s 
still work to be done but this is 
a really positive development 
and this is a strong foundation 

on which additional work and 
advocacy in the area of student 
mental health and well-being can 
be built.”

The body also discussed new 

directives to focus on during 
the year. Schafer said six new 
directives were considered as

As students returned for their 

first day of classes, The Michigan 

Daily stopped by the Diag to gather 

some of their thoughts on what 

they’re excited for in the new 

school year.

LSA Freshman Luis Orozco 

said his first few days on campus 

have been exciting because of all 

the different opportunities here at 

the University of Michigan.

 “As a freshman, I’m looking 

to find my place on campus, you 

know, find my own part within 

the Michigan community,” Orozco 

said. Orozco’s first impressions 

of campus have been positive, he 

added, but he said there has been a 

lot for him to take in.

 “A lot of people, a lot of things 

to do, a lot of events going on all the 

time. It’s kind of overwhelming, but 

it’s also manageable, there’s a lot of 

helpful people here,” he said.

 Sitting in his hammock 

between trees on the Diag, LSA 

junior Christopher Kulwik said he 

appreciated the opportunity to be 

returning to the University.

 “I’m glad to be back 

hammocking in the Diag,” Kulwik 

said. “It’s really fun.”

 Other benefits to being back on 

campus, he added: food.

 “I also like finding free food on 

campus, because I like free food,” 

Kulwik said.

 LSA sophomore Phoebe Hopp 

said she’s glad to be back at the 

University and especially looks 

forward to football Saturdays.

 “I love football gamedays, 

seeing all the maize and blue and 

just the atmosphere that comes 

along with that,” Hopp said.

 In addition, Hopp said she was 

ready to get back to the grind and 

explore new course material and 

classes this year.

 “I’m excited for a lot of the 

production and screenwriting 

classes I get to take this year,” 

Hopp said.

 LSA sophomore Anna DeVeaux 

echoed her sentiment and said 

she was ready to undertake new 

challenges this year.

 “I’m excited to start learning 

a new language — I’m starting 

Spanish from scratch this year,” 

she said.

As the summer has come 

to an end, so has a new pilot 
youth employment program 
called 
Summer 
16, 
which 

placed young people in Washt-
enaw County in jobs meant to 
give them work experience.

Forty-six young people aged 

16 to 24 were placed at vari-
ous 
community 
businesses, 

including the Ann Arbor Area 
Community Foundation, the 
Ypsilanti Food Co-op and the 
University of Michigan.

Shamar Herron, the work-

force development manager for 
Washtenaw County, said the 
program was highly success-
ful in finding long-term career 
opportunities for those par-
ticipating. The program was 
initially designed for young 
people who have distressed or 

disadvantaged 
backgrounds, 

but Herron said the program 
has attracted a diverse array of 
participants over time.

The summer work placement 

program is a collaborative 
project between Washtenaw 
County Sheriff’s Office, the 
Michigan Works! Association 
and the Ann Arbor/Ypsilanti 
Regional Chamber of Com-
merce.

Herron said his goal was to 

place the participants in fields 
such as research and IT, among 
others, to give them practical 
skills that could be applicable 
to future careers.

“Whether you were work-

ing in areas such as informa-
tion technology, government 
or non-profit industries, you 
were able to learn some tan-
gible hard skills,” Herron said.

He noted that, given that 

the program was a pilot, there 

are several areas he hopes to 
improve on next year, includ-
ing better preparing for a high 
level of interest in the program 
and ensuring all young people 
complete their jobs.

“Realistically, there were 

some bumps in the road,” Her-
ron said. “It was a pilot, and we 
didn’t do everything perfectly, 
but we did get business and 
youth connected.”

Patricia Walker, the chief 

operating 
officer 
at 
the 

AAACF, said she had positive 
experiences with Summer 16.

Youth were placed in a vari-

ety of positions, such as one 
with the AAACF, which includ-
ed customer service work, 
communication with donors 
and key constituents, coordi-
nation of database updates and 
additional research.

Walker said that if the 

youth employment program is 

renewed next summer, the 
AAACF will certainly par-
ticipate.

Next 
year 
during 
the 

planning process, the Mich-
igan 
Works! 
Association 

will 
assist 
participating 

businesses plan the employ-
ment of an intern into their 
budgeting process, primar-
ily to help alleviate the costs 
that were transferred to it 
during this year’s pilot pro-
gram.

“There are partnerships 

that we missed out on that 
we want to make sure that 
we explore,” Herron said.

Summer 16 program works with ‘U’ 
to give young people job experience

Washtenaw County youth ages 14-20 given jobs with local orgs


to a minimum the amount of 
time students were required to 
move back and forth between 
the two platforms. By the 
summer of 2016, 89 percent of 
courses used Canvas.

Sean 
DeMonner, 
ITS 

executive director of teaching 
and learning, was responsible 
for the internal team tasked 
with 
implementing 
the 

system. He said the switch to 
Canvas allows the University 
to move forward on a more 
efficient version of features 
like 
gradebook, 
assignment 

submission capabilities and a 
discussion board. Two thousand 
universities, school districts 
and 
institutions 
worldwide 

use Canvas, according to the 
Canvas website. CTools was the 
University’s own system.

“The ultimate goal is to take 

the resources, the dollars, that 
were going into the development 
of those capabilities in CTools 
and reinvest in next generation 
academic 
technologies,” 

DeMonner said.

He added that the transition 

is 
also 
the 
University’s 

response to new data analytic 
possibilities.

“We’re starting to see new 

things come into play like 
learning analytics — this idea 
that we can capture data from 
various places, analyze it and 
apply it to different kinds of 
support activities for students,” 
he said.

DeMonner 
said 
the 

University hasn’t been able to 
invest in these new support 
mechanisms to drive students’ 
success at the level that they’d 
like 
because 
they’ve 
been 

working with CTools.

Among faculty over the past 

week, opinions on the switch 
were 
mixed, 
with 
several 

expressing concerns. Initially, 
some faculty had discussed 
prolonging 
the 
transition 

process for another year to 
allow for a longer adjustment 
period.

However, 
the 
Digital 

Ecosystem Subcommittee of 
the Digital Innovation Advisory 
Group encouraged the provost 
to expedite the process. The 
faculty subcommittee no longer 
exists.

School of Public Health Prof. 

David 
Mendez, 
the 
former 

chair of the subcommittee, said 
it was important for students to 
not have to go back and forth 
between the platforms.

“What we recommended was 

a transition that could happen 
as fast as possible, but without 
rushing students or faculty,” he 
said.

Senate 
Assembly 
Chair 

Bill Schultz, an engineering 
professor, said though some 
faculty and students prefer the 
system, he is still adjusting.

“I find it is not as intuitive as 

I thought it would be,” Schultz 
said. “I think this might be 
better for students, and might 
take some transition time for 
faculty.”

American 
Culture 
Prof. 

Lisa Nakamura started using 
Canvas in winter of 2016. She 
said she would like to be able 
to make project sites through 
Canvas, such as for smaller 
reading groups within a class 
or clubs, and be able to make 
collaborative sites for students 
to make study guides on their 
own.

Overall, however, Nakamura 

said she likes Canvas better 
than CTools due to better 
interface and quickness.

“There are some annoying 

things about it, but I think 
those were also true of CTools,” 
she said.

Students 
also 
expressed 

a range of opinions about 
Canvas, but several said they 
were happy just to not need to 
switch back and forth between 
platforms.

LSA sophomore Clare Shafer 

said it was an inconvenience 
using both sites when she 
just wanted to double check 
something for a class.

“I had one class on CTools 

last semester and it was really 
annoying 
because 
I 
was 

constantly having to log in and 
then log back out,” she said. “I 
just wanted to be able to quickly 
access my classes and see if I 
had homework.”

Shafer also said she preferred 

Canvas because of its layout.

“I think how they have the 

grade tab and the calendar tab 
is more efficient than it was 
on CTools,” she said. “Canvas 
seems more modern.”

LSA junior Tad Conrado 

had a similar perspective. He 
said he preferred the style on 
Canvas and liked having to only 
access one platform.

LSA senior Evan David said 

he preferred CTools because 
it had a more obvious user 
interface, but is fine using 
Canvas.

“Personally, I liked CTools 

better in general,” he said. 
“I 
thought 
it 
was 
more 

streamlined and I thought the 
user interface was easier.”

In spite of the big adjustment, 

DeMonner said the support 
that Canvas has received has 
been very important for its 
integration at the University.

“A change like this, even 

though it has happened over a 
period of two years, is hugely 
impactful 
for 
campus,” 
he 

said. “It touches pretty much 
every student, all the faculty, 
with very few exceptions. We 
have received a lot of support 
in partnership from different 
constituencies around campus. 
I appreciate that, and I thank 
folks for going with us on the 
journey.”

students’ 

living options, but emphasized 
the 
inaccessibility 
of 
safe, 

affordable housing for students 
close to campus. She added 
that she worries students are 
expected to sacrifice safety, 
security and convenience when 
searching for apartments.

“More student housing in 

this area is good, especially 
because most concerns about 
housing 
involve 
safety,” 

Yang said. “It’s good that the 

apartments will be so close to 
the Diag and Central Campus, 
but, on the other hand, places 
in these areas charge a lot for 
housing. This is frustrating 
because it implies that safety 
comes only with wealth.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Tara 

Jayaram 
echoed 
Yang’s 

sentiment.

“It depends on the price,” 

she said. “If it’s affordable off-
campus housing, then I’d be 
really happy about it. But if it’s 
something like Zaragon Place, 
I just feel like it wouldn’t be 
worth living there.”

However 
LSA 
sophomore 

Jessica 
Bleiweis, 
a 
current 

Landmark resident, said she 
believes the cost of rent at 
high-rises like hers reflects 
the quality and convenience of 
her experience. She added that 
she appreciates the amenities 
provided by the complex, which 
offer her a more comfortable 
living arrangement than that in 

dorms.

“I feel like (the new building) 

would be a really good idea,” 
Bleiweis said. “I know that there 
are people who are struggling 
with finding housing, and, if it’s 
as nice as Landmark, I’m sure 
they’ll get a bunch of people 
who want to live there.”

Ron Hughes, a developer at 

Hughes Properties, declined 
to 
comment 
about 
future 

development plans and the 
completion date when contacted 
by The Michigan Daily Tuesday. 
However, to move forward, the 
project will first need to be 
reviewed by the city’s Design 
Review Board and the city’s 
Planning 
Commission, 
and 

then approved by City Council, 
a process which usually takes at 
least several months. Specific 
dates for design review board or 
planning commission meetings 
that would include a review of 
the project were not available 
Tuesday.

a focus for the body’s future 
goals. These directives include 
an increase of student input on 
University 
decision-making, 

fostering a more inclusive campus 
environment, 
an 
expanding 

student 
access 
to 
resources, 

conducting 
more 
sustained 

CSG 
outreach, 
enhancing 

student 
opportunities 
and 

promoting greater collaboration 
among students and student 
organizations.

As 
well, 
the 
body 
will 

commission 
a 
demographic 

report 
of 
the 
organization 

for the first time to be more 
transparent about the diversity 
on the assembly. A Michigan 

Daily 
report 
conducted 
last 

March 
found 
a 
trend 
in 

hegemonic practices after the 
presidential slot was filled by a 
man for the seventh consecutive 
year. In a comparison of CSG 
presidential and vice presidential 
representation to the student 
population, 
disparities 
were 

discovered across the board in 
almost all categories but white 
students.

“We are all really committed 

to 
ensuring 
that 
CSG 
is 

more 
inclusive, 
diverse 
and 

representative in the year ahead,” 
Schafer said. “I think it’s not only 
going to hold us more accountable 
as an organization to improve our 
diversity in the long term, but it’s 
also going to allow us to possibly 
set objectives and measures going 
forward and benchmarks that we 

can apply for our future now and 
in the long term.”

After the data is collected, 

Schafer said a report about the 
findings will be published.

In 
accordance 
with 
the 

directives, 
Schafer 
also 

discussed the launch of an 
executive order calling for an 
internal improvement taskforce 
within the body to improve its 
demographics and address their 
diversity as an organization, 
such as looking into methods of 
guaranteeing first-year student 
representation on the body. The 
taskforce would be staffed by the 
newly elected Student General 
Counsel as well as the Chief 
Justice and Student Judiciary, 
a member of the CSG Rules 
Committee and another member 
of the body.

As council discussed the 

issue for the final time, City 
Councilmembers 
Jack 
Eaton 

(D–Ward 4), Jane Lumm (I–
Ward 2) and Sumi Kailasapathy 
(D–Ward 1) — who typically 
dissent against the approval of 
large construction projects — 
all made clear they would vote 
in opposition to approving the 
Woodbury project.

Eaton 
argued 
the 

fundamental 
environmental 

and 
infrastructural 
issues 

surrounding the project have 
not been adequately addressed 
in 
explaining 
his 
vote 
in 

opposition.

“We 
can 
pretend 
this 

development 
isn’t 
going 
to 

impact traffic on the roads,” 
Eaton said. “We can pretend 
this project isn’t going to impact 
flooding in the surrounding 
areas, we can pretend this 
project isn’t going to impact 
nearby natural features. I don’t 
believe we should rezone this 
property and I don’t believe we 
should approve the site plan.”

Eaton’s 
sentiments 
were 

echoed by Lumm, who also 
made clear she believes the 
project would fundamentally 
hurt surrounding residents and 
the environment.

“In the city’s desire to add 

density citywide, we allow these 
projects to proceed without 
their 
own 
infrastructure 

support,” Lumm said. “Both 
these projects will exacerbate 
traffic 
problems 
in 
already 

problematic areas … our job is to 
accept that reality.”

Kailasapathy 
was 
also 

outspoken against approving 
the project. She argued the 
Woodbury apartment project is 
emblematic of a broader issue 

of City Council pushing for 
development projects without 
adequate concern for existing 
residents.

“I like to face facts, I prefer 

to live in reality … a couple of 
weeks ago after rain we got 
photographs from neighbors (of 
flooding),” Kailasapathy said. 
“This project is going to add 500 
parking spaces — imagine the 
runoff; there’s a big disconnect 

between the projects we’re 
approving and the people who 
are living there.”

Despite the opposition, all 

eight remaining members of 
the council — including Mayor 
Christopher Taylor — voted 
in favor of rezoning the Nixon 
Road land parcel to residential 
and approving the Woodbury 
construction plan.

City Councilmember Zachary 

Ackerman (D–Ward 3) — who 
voted in favor of the project 
— 
argued 
the 
development 

is necessary to increase the 
local housing supply to meet 
growing demand. Ackerman’s 
points were echoed by the other 
council 
members 
voting 
in 

favor.

“This piece of land is fewer 

than two miles from (North 
Campus 
Research 
Complex) 

and 
Googleplex,” 
Ackerman 

said, referring to the site of the 
proposed apartments. “We are 
in need of more diverse housing 
in more diverse locations.”

The ultimate goal is 
to take the resources, 

the dollars, that 

were going into the 
development of those 
capabilities in CTools 
and reinvest in next 
generation academic 

technologies.

T

he beginning of a new 
semester 
here 
at 
the 

University of Michigan 

provides a wonderful opportunity 
to 
appreciate 
the 
amazing 

educational 
environment 
we 

share, surrounded by outstanding 
faculty members, expert staff and 
extraordinarily talented students.

Thanks to you, every moment 

at the University provides a 
precious opportunity to learn. 
Learning takes place in our 
classrooms, labs, performance 
halls and libraries. It takes place 
when we discuss ideas and issues 
in residence halls, over meals and 
while socializing.

Learning at the University 

is enriched by the intellectual 
breadth and diversity of our 
university 
community. 
The 

University is fortunate to include 
such 
a 
wonderful 
range 
of 

individual perceptions, scholarly 
viewpoints 
and 
people 
from 

every U.S. state and more than 
120 countries around the world.

In a place with so many 

diverse perspectives, however, 
disagreement is often inevitable. 
But it can also be invaluable.

The conflict of discordant 

ideas and opinions — even when 
it makes us uncomfortable — 
is an essential feature of an 
academic community. At the 
University, we are at our best 

when our discourse is inclusive 
and welcoming to conflicting 
ideas and diverse voices.

It 
challenges 
our 
way 
of 

thinking. It helps us grow. It 
teaches us how to work through 
problems in groups and express 
ourselves in ways that bring 
about positive change. It allows 
us to take advantage of the full 
breadth and benefits of a UM 
education.

Our ability to learn together 

is guided by core values of the 
University, including respect, 
civility 
and 
equality. 
These 

values are also essential to 
our educational environment. 
Speech 
that 
is 
hateful 
or 

threatening diminishes learning 
by inhibiting discussion, and it 
does not lift up our community.

For 
the 
last 
decade, 
our 

“Expect 
Respect” 
campaign 

has focused on these issues in a 
campus-wide partnership that 
emphasizes the value we derive 
from our similarities and our 
differences. 
Expect 
Respect 

states, “Together, we can create 
and 
maintain 
a 
respectful 

and 
inclusive 
environment 

that provides the support and 
opportunity necessary for each 
member of our community to 
prosper and achieve.”

The ability to respectfully and 

honestly engage with people of 

differing worldviews is one of 
the most essential skills we can 
learn — and teach. As part of our 
ongoing efforts to engage many 
views, we will continue to have 
conversations 
across 
campus 

about the complex intersection 
of free speech and respect.

We 
do 
this 
not 
just 
as 

educators and students on a 
campus, but as members of 
society who aspire to lead in the 
larger world. These are lessons 
that apply to the coming months 
and years, to this election cycle 
and beyond, as well as to all who 
pursue knowledge in service of 
the public good.

For 
nearly 
two 
centuries, 

we 
have 
drawn 
tremendous 

intellectual 
strength 
from 

the breadth and diversity of 
our community. I hope that 
the 
University 
community 

will always be an inalienable 
forum 
for 
discovery, 
debate 

and discussion, a place where 
respect and disagreement are 
complementary, 
where 
each 

makes the other stronger and 
where we all advocate for and 
learn from their confluence.

It 
is 
my 
honor 
to 
learn 

beside you, the members of the 
University community.

They’re both lying

D

onald Trump’s entrance 
into 
the 
presidential 

election has brought a 

couple of policy issues to the 
forefront — and one of those is 
trade. Trump has yelled at the 
top of his lungs against trade 
agreements 
like 
the 
North 

American Free Trade Agreement 
and 
the 
Trans-Pacific 

Partnership, 
while 
Clinton 

quietly tries to pivot away from 
the fact NAFTA was signed 
while she lived in the White 
House. While they both try to 
push their anti-trade rhetoric, 
history shows that they’re lying, 
and all in an attempt to woo the 
Midwest and the Rust Belt.

First, the facts on NAFTA and 

the TPP: NAFTA, signed by Bill 
Clinton, is a trade agreement 
between 
the 
United 
States, 

Mexico and Canada to eliminate 
barriers to trade and investment 
between 
North 
American 

countries. Supporters like the 
organization Council on Foreign 
Relations 
argue 
that 
“some 

fourteen million jobs rely on 
trade with Canada and Mexico,” 
while the opposition argues that 
the 
added 
competition 
from 

low-wage countries has caused 
increased 
unemployment 
and 

wage stagnation.

Both sides have their merits: 

Free trade and globalization 
can lead to wage stagnation, 
but these things also promote 
higher-paying and better quality 
jobs. In reality, the net effect 
was financially positive, but the 
advantages are widespread while 
the negatives are concentrated 
in one area — manufacturing. 
In addition, trade agreements 
in general facilitate improved 
relationships between countries.

The TPP aims to do something 

similar: increase trade in order 
to create jobs. But in addition 
it seeks to act as a stopper on 
China’s rising power in Asia. By 
promoting trade and becoming 
more involved in the area, the 
United States hopes to exercise 

its 
influence 
to 
fight 
back 

against China’s rising influence. 
While economically the same 
pros and cons exist, the check 
on China is a big advantage that 
supporters, including President 
Barack Obama, really hope to 
implement.

Now, onto the candidates. 

Trump 
has 
repeatedly 
said 

that he plans to “rip up” trade 
agreements. 
The 
candidate, 

through 
his 
rhetoric, 

purposefully 
creates 
the 

impression that he is against 
any trade agreement, but this is 
not true. Trump claims not to be 
against free trade, but for “fair 
trade.” His proposed solution 
is to re-negotiate NAFTA, stop 
the TPP and impose a tariff on 
imported goods from China. 
He says he believes the world is 
taking advantage of us, and we 
need to be stricter with our trade 
agreements and be willing to 
walk away from them — in order 
to protect American jobs.

In 
reality, 
while 
Trump 

does believe these trade deals 
are hurting us, he is (most 
likely) 
practical 
and 
aware 

of 
his 
limitations 
in 
doing 

so as president. In his 2008 
book, “Never Give Up,” Trump 
wrote: “The important thing to 
consider is that more and more 
there is an interdependence of 
world economies. No one can 
afford to be isolationist any 
more. Keep your focus global. 
Globalization has torn down 
the barriers that have formerly 
separated the national from the 
international markets.” Trump 
is a manipulator — he uses his 
rhetoric to portray himself as 
the defender of the American 
worker, but he knows he can’t 
do it, and by slipping in the idea 
of “fair trade,” which does not 
mean anything (he can claim 
anything he negotiates is fair), 
he keeps the window open for 
him to flip on the issue come the 
time he sits in the Oval Office. 

Clinton 
sat 
in 
the 
White 

House in 1993 when her husband 
signed NAFTA into law, and she 
has praised the bill in the past. 
As secretary of state, she sat by 
Obama’s side as he negotiated 
and attempted to fast-track the 
TPP agreement. In spite of all 
of this, she stands in front of 
her crowds and claims she is 
against these agreements. Terry 
McAuliffe, arguably one of the 
Clinton’s closest confidants for 
years, slipped and admitted that 
Clinton has said she supports the 
TPP during recess. It’s hard to 
believe someone who fought for 
free trade for so long, who helped 
negotiate the TPP and said back 
in 2012 that it “sets the gold 
standard in trade agreements” 
all of a sudden thinks it to be 
unworthy.

So this brings us to the 

question of why. Why are they 
lying? Well, in an election where 
Trump’s path to 270 electoral 
votes is as slim as ever, he needs 
to win the Rust Belt, which 
includes Pennsylvania, Michigan 
and Ohio. Trump’s game plan is 
to target white, working-class 
voters — the ones most affected 
by trade — and to claim that these 
trade agreements brought down 
the fall of the auto industry and 
the manufacturing Rust Belt. 
He hopes to win mostly white 
Western Pennsylvania to counter 
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh to 
take the state, and to target the 
fears of those in manufacturing 
Ohio and Michigan. If he could 
win those three states, he could 
win 
the 
presidency. 
Clinton 

knows this, too: If all she needs 
to do to win these three states 
is to lie about her thoughts on 
trade, she’ll do it. We don’t know 
how they’ll act once one of them 
sits in the Oval Office, but both 
are playing smart politics on 
trade. In other words: They’re 
lying.

M

y 
first 
two 
years 
at 
the 

University of Michigan were 
incredibly 
difficult 
— 
not 

necessarily academically (at first), but on 
a personal level. I was struggling socially. 
I felt somewhat lost in 300-person, intro-
level lecture halls where reading the 
slides and binging on textbooks the night 
before a blue book exam was enough to 
secure a top grade. I was insecure around 
the people who, with such ease, seemed to 
have so much fun going out to fraternity 
parties and bars regularly — something 
that made me extremely uncomfortable 
and often landed me alone in my dorm 
room, armed with my 
computer and my family’s 
Netflix login. It didn’t 
help that our football 
team sucked.

There were, of course, 

bright moments. I drank 
for the first time and 
came to terms with the 
fact that it’s OK to do that 
(and even like it) every so 
often, provided that it’s 
calculated and not out of 
control. I befriended one 
of my psych professors, 
who likely doesn’t know the extent to 
which her kindness and eagerness to help 
me succeed buoyed me. I slowly solidified 
concrete friendships with people on this 
newspaper, in my classes and even some 
who I’d met by chance during the first 
weeks of school. It wasn’t all bad — far 
from it, actually. But it sometimes felt like 
the bad outweighed the good.

By sophomore year, though I didn’t 

admit it to myself, I was struggling with 
depression. It was hard to get out of bed 
some mornings and easier to sleep all day. 
I felt homesick. I considered transferring 
schools at one point. It was a culmination 
of feeling isolated in a place with so many 
people. I know that all of this doesn’t 
really feed the widespread enthusiasm 
that returning to one of the most glorious 
schools on the planet usually entails — so 
here’s the upside.

I certainly found that I was not alone in 

even my darkest struggles, and I want you 
to know that you won’t be either. Don’t 
be afraid or ashamed if college isn’t what 
you expect it to be. Embrace it. Of course, 
recognize and celebrate what goes well; 
but, if there is suckiness along the way, 
know that it’s completely normal — and 
rest assured that it will get better.

If you feel alone, lost, unsure of your 

future, existentially confused, angsty, 
depressed, exhausted … well, join the 
club. Know that it’s a big group with an 
infinite alumni base. Struggling feels 
awful while it’s happening, but it makes 
you appreciate the light at the end of the 
tunnel so much more.

Looking back, Michigan is a place that 

forced me to get out of my comfort zone. 
Its size made my drive to find smaller, 
engaging communities that much more 

important. I couldn’t have made it through 
without the Daily, without the Lloyd Hall 
Scholars Program and the Ford School. 
I was determined to feed my interests 
with smart people who challenged me and 
broadened my worldview, and the people 
I’ve met through those communities have 
gone above and beyond.

It is a place that gave me a platform 

to simultaneously enjoy an immersive 
liberal arts education and pursue my 
professional interests during the year. For 
example, interning for “60 Minutes” in 
Washington D.C. through the University’s 
Michigan in Washington program was a 

unique and life-changing 
opportunity 
that 
I 

wouldn’t trade for the 
world.

It is a place that built 

upon my understanding 
of diversity and inclusive 
language, and my ability 
to 
engage 
others 
in 

dialogue by truly listening 
before I respond, not just 
pushing my own agenda.

It 
is 
a 
place 
that 

humbled me by exposing 
me to students who dazzle 

with their intelligence and high potential 
to change this world for the better (yes, 
folks, the “Michigan Difference” is a real 
thing out there). This is certainly not a 
place to rest on one’s laurels.

Freshmen (and even sophomores), I am 

in no position to tell you that all four years 
of college will be the best of your lives. 
They might not be. But I can tell you that 
it’s going to be OK. All of this positivity is 
borne of, and strengthened in contrast to, 
the initial struggle to find and understand 
myself. That struggle persists (a fact of 
life to which any senior can attest), but I 
am undoubtedly better for it and grateful 
for the perspective it has given me. You 
will be, too.

This is the beginning of the end. You 

blink an eye, and suddenly you’re having 
conversations over drinks with friends about 
job prospects, rent, the economy, politics, 
etc. Sure, it’s just cheap sangria, but you 
start to have these out-of-body experiences 
in which you hear yourself talking and 
realize that you sound like an adult.

As that happens, you understand that 

college is where you really grow up 
and come into your own. The ensuing 
contentedness makes the struggle so 
worth it.

I guess the lesson here is, before you 

know it, you’ll blink, and it’ll be more 
bittersweet 
than 
you 
ever 
could’ve 

imagined. Maybe you don’t realize how 
much fun you’ve had until you’re nearly 
done having it — but that just means there’s 
always something to look forward to.

Welcome back.

Well-rounded ‘Pete’

By SYDNEY COHEN

For The Daily

Right on cue, the Disney movie 

mill has churned out another high-
quality film with a big-name cast, 
this time in the 
form of simple 
and 
frothy 

children’s 
film 

“Pete’s Dragon.” 
While the film 
is not altogether 
remarkable, 
it 

stands to argue 
that sometimes 
meeting expec-
tations of mediocrity can be pleas-
ing in its own right. With its own 
set of high and low moments, 
“Pete’s Dragon” boasts of child-
hood whimsy in the classic Disney 
fashion.

The film follows the story of 

its titular character, a young boy 
named Pete (Oakes Fegley, “Board-
walk Empire”) who is orphaned 
and stranded in the woods after 
his parents die in a sudden car 
accident. After wandering around 
the forest alone and afraid, Pete is 
rescued by a friendly and impres-
sively 
animated 
furry 
green 

dragon, whom he dubs Elliot. Fast 
forward six years, and cue a classic 
Tarzan-esque scene of Pete, long-
haired and loin-clothed, tromp-
ing through the forest with Elliot, 
carefree and uninhibited. How 

he’s survived for six years in the 
forest with no adult supervision 
is unimportant — the film offers a 
heartwarming picture of two lost 
boys who have created a home for 
themselves in the wilderness.

Pete’s status quo is interrupt-

ed by the introduction of a cast 
of human characters, including 
Natalie (Oona Laurence, “South-
paw”), the curious young girl; 
Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard, “The 
Help”), the maternal forest ranger; 
and Meacham (Robert Redford, “A 
Walk in the Woods”), the folkloric 
grandfather. Pete is discovered 
and reluctantly taken to the nearby 
town, and struggles to adjust to the 
civilized world in a stressful scene 
of sensory overload. As he begins 
to settle in with Grace and her 
family, Pete struggles to negotiate 
between his sense of belonging and 
his sense of home.

The largest blemish on an oth-

erwise pleasant story is the film’s 
overarching conflict; Karl Urban 
(“Star Trek”) plays the antagonist 
with a disturbingly bloodthirsty 
quality that seems starkly out of 
place in a children’s movie. Urban’s 
character hunts, shoots, chains 
and keeps captive the harmless 
green dragon with admittedly zero 
motivation other than to prove he’s 
capable of doing it. The result is 
equally traumatizing and comical 
as Urban’s unmotivated violence 
serves no purpose other than to 

further the plot. Disney insists on 
creating a human villain with vio-
lent tendencies rather than delving 
deeper into internal psychological 
conflicts such as culture shock and 
what it means to belong.

For the most part, “Pete’s 

Dragon” is a charming adaption 
of its namesake children’s story, 
wrought with fantastical story-
book charm. The score by Daniel 
Hart (“Comet”) is whimsical and 
infectious, and the gratuitous land-
scape shots of the north pacific for-
est are gorgeous. Furthermore, the 
film’s most prominent gold nugget 
is the ease with which the charac-
ters in the film accept the existence 
of the mythical creature. There is 
no conflict with what constitutes 
reality; for example, Pete’s crayon 
drawing of Elliot is not met with 
skepticism by Grace, but with curi-
osity. The film ultimately retains 
the theme that childhood belief in 
something that doesn’t seem plau-
sible shouldn’t be ignored or down-
graded, but instead explored and 
praised. The film stands out from 
other members of the children’s 
fantasy genre as it subtly sub-
verts the traditional development 
of skepticism to understanding, 
instead offering trust in the unbe-
lievable. Simple and predictable, 
“Pete’s Dragon” isn’t the worst 
thing to be pumped out of Disney, 
nor is it the best; it simply gets the 
job done.

FILM REVIEW

By MADELEINE GAUDIN

Daily Film Columnist

It wasn’t even intentional. 

It wasn’t a cleanse or a detox 
or a challenge. It just sort of 
happened. I wasn’t supposed to 
learn anything.

I went three months without 

watching a movie. The last 
movie I watched was “The 
Lobster.” So, bonus points for 
a hard-to-hold indie, double 
bonus points for seeing it in 
theaters, triple bonus points 
for seeing it by myself (if you’re 

into that sort of thing).

That was in early June, and 

I haven’t been in a theater 
since. I haven’t even watched 
anything on Netflix. No DVDs 
(throwback!), no pay-per-view, 
no off-brand Blockbuster 
that is somehow still all over 
small-town New Hampshire. 
Nothing.

I was working as a counselor 

at a summer camp in Vermont, 
I had limited access to my 
phone and even more limited 
access to larger screens. The 
Wi-Fi was too slow to stream 

anything and the nearest 
theater was a half hour away. 
So, I was forced to completely 
unplug from my favorite 
strain of pop culture for three 
months.

And it was sort of incredible. 

I’m behind — I’m what’s-the-
name-of-that-new-Adele-song 
level behind. Part of me is 
happy that “Harambe” means 
nothing to me and that I don’t 
know what Donald Trump 
said last week. I am, however, 
a little upset that I didn’t get 
the chance to watch all the 

FILM COLUMN

The power of a pop-
culture sabbatical

wonderful and horrible and 
wonderfully horrible movies 
that came out this summer.

Yes, I know, I can always 

watch these movies (the power 
of the internet!). I didn’t wake 
up from a coma in an alternate 
reality where all popular 
culture had been reset. But, 
it felt overwhelming looking 
at this long list of movies I 
hadn’t seen and trying to find 
a place to start. Should I go 
chronologically or from best 
to worst reviews or vice versa? 
Things got more complicated 
as I began to include other 
films into the running movies 
from the long list I call 
“Movies I’ve Never Watched 
and Sometimes Pretend To 
Have Seen So People Will Stop 
Telling Me to Watch Them.” 
Maybe now would be the best 
time to watch “Star Wars”? Do 
I have to watch the original 
“Ghostbusters” before seeing 
the new one?

I care about being able to 

hold my own in pop culture 
conversations. It’s easy to roll 
my eyes at boys in my film 
classes who cannot believe I 
haven’t seen “The Godfather.” 
But watching the value of my 
thoughts decrease (even in the 
eyes of a very eye-roll-worthy 
film boy) is hard.

I know I have something to 

say about movies, no matter 
what I’ve seen. If the pop 
culture reset I got this summer 
has taught me anything, it’s 
that it doesn’t matter. I’m 
not an expert. I’m not the 
most well-versed film buff at 
this school. But that doesn’t 
matter to me anymore. My film 
knowledge can’t be measured 
by what I haven’t seen, rather 
by what I have.

So, that’s why I’m still here. 

That’s why I can still be here 
(despite what film boy has to 
say), writing about something 
that I don’t know everything 

about. And as I begin to take 
residence in this weird little 
space called the Daily Arts Film 
Column, it is important for me 
to justify (mostly to myself) 
why I’m here. I’m not an expert 
and I never will be. I’m here 
because I like stories and I like 
art and I like to look at things 
and listen to things, and if you 
pour all that into one cup, it 
makes a mixed drink called 
cinema and that is something I 
really love.

Despite the sky clearing and 

the choir of angels singing, the 
queue on my Netflix still made 
my head hurt.

So instead, I chose what 

I wanted to watch. And I 
rewatched “Heathers.” And it 
was so very, and in my humble 
(yet very valid) opinion, much 
better than “Star Wars.”

Still hung up on “The 

Lobster”? Take a breather and

BOOK REVIEW
‘Choice’ parodies 
modern testing

By KARL WILLIAMS

Daily Arts Writer

Chilean 
writer 
Alejandro 

Zambra’s latest book is a nov-
elty — it’s a novel written in 
the 
form 
of 

a 
multiple 

choice 
exam. 

The 
premise 

sounds like a 
joke and seems 
to resign the 
book to failure 
at first look. 
One wonders can he pull it off? 
Can he sustain the conceit for 
an entire book?

The short answer is that he 

does. And brilliantly so. “Mul-
tiple Choice,” the fifth of Zam-
bra’s books to be translated into 
English, is a strikingly original, 
funny and moving novel. At a 
little over 100 pages, a char-
acteristic length for Zambra, 
it’s a firework of a book in the 
mode of Nabokov’s “Pale Fire” 
and Cortazar’s “Hopscotch.” 
The book is an act of remem-
brance, a formal experiment, 
metafictional rift on education 
and Chilean society, a comic 
game of literary interpretation, 
a political critique and a parody 
of standardized testing — all in 
one. Few books can do so much 
with so little.

The book repurposes the 

college entrance exam under 

Pinochet 
— 
the 
Academic 

Aptitude Exam — becoming 
not just formally innovative but 
politically charged. It’s based 
on the test from 1993, the year 
Zambra, who loves to play with 
the ambiguities between fiction 
and life, took it. He recycles a 
piece of dreaded bureaucratic 
material and transforms it into 
a magnificent parody of the 
inadequacy 
of 
standardized 

testing. As a teacher says to his 
former students near the end of 
the book, “you weren’t educated, 
you were trained.” Zambra’s 
book is an exercise in this 
miseducation.

“Multiple Choice” is a series 

of vignettes of life in Chile under 
the Pinochet regime. Zambra 
tells the stories of everyday 
citizens during the dictatorship 
in the strangest forms. The 
book is divided into five tests: 
Excluded Term, Sentence Order, 
Sentence Completion, Sentence 
Elimination 
and 
Reading 

Comprehension. Zambra makes 
great use out of the narrative 
possibilities that these forms 
bring.

Zambra’s novel risks being 

merely clever but overcomes 
it. Because of its brevity (could 
anyone read a 500-page book in 
the same form?) and Zambra’s 
ability to realize characters 
almost 
immediately 
upon 

entrance, the book works well 

both as a series of revelations 
about Chilean life and as a comic 
enactment of the standardized 
test.

In Reading Comprehension, 

which consists of three different 
reading tests and is the finest 
section of the book, we get the 
stories of the Covarrubias, who 
cheat on the college entrance 
exam so that both can get into 
the best college; of a recently 
married couple in Chile, where 
divorce was illegal until 2004; 
and of a father who writes a 
letter to his son in which he 
expresses regret that his son 
was ever born. These are all 
good stories on their own, 
and when reading, one forgets 
they’re part of a test.

In 
the 
second 
section, 

about the married couple, for 
example, Zambra shows his 
acerbic wit. The fourth question 
reads: “According to the text, at 
the beginning of the twenty-
first century the nation of 
Chile was: A) Conservative in 
its morality and liberal in its 
economy. B) Conservative in 
its inebriety and artificial in all 
things holy. C) Innovative in its 
levity and literal in its tragedy. 
D) Aggressive in its religiosity 
and conjugal in its wizardry. E) 
Exhaustive in its chicanery and 
indecisive in its celerity.” It’s a 
90-question test, but somehow 
they’re almost all this good.

Piety disrupted 
in WWII drama

By SYDNEY COHEN

For The Daily

World War II cinema often 

focuses on classic perpetrator-
victim tropes, with the same 
classes 
of 
people 

occupying the 
same 
roles. 

Yet 
“The 

Innocents” 
focuses in on 
the 
fringes 

of 
Poland, 

spotlighting 
the story of 
the marginalized, the forgotten 
and the abused.

“The 
Innocents,” 
set 
in 

immediate 
post-World 
War 

II Poland, tells the story of 
Mathilde 
(Lou 
de 
Laâge, 

“The Wait”), a French nurse 
volunteering 
with 
the 
Red 

Cross, who discovers and aids 
a convent of nuns dealing with 
multiple pregnancies caused by 
rape at the hands of invading 
Russian 
soldiers. 
The 
film 

focuses on the impact of the 
Russian invasion — a widely 

overlooked 
and 
forgotten 

section of history — specifically 
the innocent bystanders in 
Poland 
who 
suffered 
their 

own atrocities during World 
War II. Even more so, the 
film offers a view into a realm 
rarely discussed — it is a piece 
exclusively centered around the 
female experience.

A cast of female characters 

allows us multiple perspectives 
on the situation of unwanted 
pregnancy 
in 
a 
chaste 

community, 
with 
complex 

emotions 
and 
questions 
of 

morality 
being 
discussed 

through characterization. De 
Laâge’s Mathilde is the skilled, 
determined and compassionate 
nurse who transitions from 
the invasive foreigner to the 
trusted 
savior 
through 
her 

tireless determination to help 
the nuns. Her altruism is only 
muddled by a perpetual mask 
of stoicism, which works to add 
complexity to her character. 
Agata Buzek (“Redemption”) 
plays Maria, the woman who 
enlisted Mathilde’s help and 
tries to hold together the 

falling pieces of the nuns’ lives. 
Maria embodies strength and 
perseverance, with an added 
layer of intrigue accorded to 
her with hints at a promiscuous 
former 
life. 
Finally, 
Agata 

Kulesza (“Ida”) plays the Abbess, 
a woman struggling to do what 
she believes is best for her 
convent while sacrificing herself 
in the process. The brilliance of 
the characterization is that no 
woman is one-dimensional in her 
motivations or actions; instead, 
each 
woman 
is 
individual 

and compelling. The acting is 
genuine and convincing, as each 
woman portrays her own fear in 
nuanced yet powerful ways.

The 
film 
is 
not 
entirely 

without men. The male voice 
is Samuel (Vincent Macaigne, 
“Sunday 
Lunch”), 
the 
head 

doctor at the Red Cross. While he 
helps deliver some of the babies, 
his male perspective seems 
superfluous, and he doesn’t do 
much besides mimic Mathilde’s 
work and try to get her into bed. 
As a film portraying the 1940s, 
it is important to keep in mind 
that while it focuses on the

FILM REVIEW

lives of women, it’s ultimately 
a film set in a male-dominated 
world (for example, Mathilde 
can only practice medicine as a 
doctor when in an environment 
absent of men). This calls into 
question the necessity of a male 
role in a film about the female 
experience: 
Is 
it 
necessary 

because 
it’s 
historically 

accurate, or does it undermine 
its feminist nature?

In regards to cinematography, 

the movie is dark, disturbing 
and 
raw. 
Director 
Anne 

Fontaine 
(“Adore”) 
makes 

brilliant 
aesthetic 
decisions; 

the shots are cold and dark, 

oscillating 
between 
barren 

winter landscapes and empty 
stone corridors. Devoid of color 
or comfort, the design enhances 
the emotional impact of the 
movie. In terms of its conflicts, 
the film deals with the issues of 
rape and unwanted pregnancy 
with austerity. One scene, in 
which Mathilde is almost raped 
herself by Russian soldiers, is 
bone-chilling and traumatizing, 
emphasizing the powerlessness 
of herself, the convent and 
women in general. Later, we see 
the Abbess leaving a newborn to 
die of exposure and the baby’s 
mother committing suicide soon 

after, 
highlighting 
questions 

of 
whether 
good 
intentions 

justify morally ambiguous acts. 
Religion works as a central 
motif, as the women’s faith in 
Christianity, and even humanity, 
is continually tested.

“The Innocents” is a movie 

about the female experience, 
the 
hardships 
endured 
by 

marginalized 
women 
of 
a 

desolate war-torn country, and 
the love and support they gave 
each other. While it rips you to 
shreds for two hours, the film 
ends on a satisfying, if fragile, 
note of hope. It is an important 
lesson on history and humanity.

TV NOTEBOOK

What is TV without 
 

HBO’s stronghold?

By ALEX INTNER

Daily Arts Writer

We’re used to hearing about 

HBO as being the standard-
bearer of television. For years 
now, it’s the network that has 
been the most Emmy nominated 
(mainly because of the variety 
and 
quality 
of 
content 
it 

produces). It’s the network that 
the likes of Netflix, Showtime 
and Starz try to emulate in 
their everyday programming 
decisions.

Yet, HBO finds itself in a 

precarious position for the 
first time in several years. 
While there’s no denying the 
massive success of “Game of 
Thrones,” the drama will only 
have two more seasons on the 
air. Outside of “Thrones,” the 
network has very few other 
established 
dramas. 
“The 

Leftovers” is its only other 
drama existing past its first 
season, and that will end with 
its third airing in 2017. Their 
last big attempt at a drama hit, 
“Vinyl,” was unceremoniously 
unrenewed after it realized the 
dramatic retooling the show’s 
second season would require 
wasn’t worth the investment. 
They’re 
even 
considering 

reviving the “True Detective” 
franchise after its critically 
panned second season without 
showrunner Nic Pizzolatto.

That means that, if nothing 

else succeeds, HBO will find 
itself with zero established 

dramas on the network. To 
combat this, they’re going to 
be putting a heavy emphasis 
on new programming. This 
starts this fall with the launch 
of “Westworld.” The network 
has invested substantial time 
and money into the series. A 
pilot was first ordered back in 
2013, and in 2014 it was picked 
up to series with a targeted 
2015 premiere date. However, 
production stoppages and other 
delays forced the show off that 
date, and it finally makes its 
debut in October. The network 
also has upcoming shows from 
familiar creators already picked 
up to series. David Simon (“The 
Wire”) will be making a series 
about the porn industry in New 
York City in the ’70s called “The 
Deuce” and Alan Ball (“True 
Blood”) will be returning to his 
roots in family drama, though 
the show does not yet have a 
title.

Still, none of these shows 

are guaranteed surefire hits. 
A 
development 
process 
as 

tumultuous 
as 
“Westworld” 

’s does not usually inspire 
confidence. And, though Simon 
has created what are considered 
to be two of the network’s most 
acclaimed series in “The Wire” 
and “Treme,” they never had 
huge audiences at the level of a 
“The Sopranos” or a “Game of 
Thrones.”

All 
these 
problems 
are 

compounded 
by 
the 
recent 

regime change at the network. 

Michael Lombardo recently left 
his position as president of the 
network and was replaced by 
one of his key deputies Casey 
Bloys to replace him. Usually it 
takes a new leader a few years 
to establish their presence at 
the network and develop shows 
in their own voice, but HBO 
doesn’t have time to lose. It 
needs to work on developing 
hits fast. HBO’s development 
process is notoriously slow, as 
exhibited by “Westworld.” They 
don’t have the years it takes to 
slowly nurture something out 
of the gate right now. They need 
to get a hit drama on the air in 
the next year, or they risk being 
without one at all.

However, HBO has been 

in this position before. “The 
Sopranos” went off the air in 
2007 and was immediately 
followed up by the flop “John 
from Cincinnati” and “Tell 
Me You Love Me,” which was 
renewed for a second season 
and cancelled several months 
later when they couldn’t figure 
out what a second season would 
be. Still, a year later, “True 
Blood” premiered. The vampire 
drama quickly grew into the 
network’s biggest hit since the 
famous mob drama, giving them 
a building block they could 
used to sure up their schedule. 
It meant they could maintain 
their reputation as the home for 
quality, buzzworthy TV. After 
all, what’s the TV landscape 
without a strong HBO?

Atuahene, Sahlool spark ‘M’

By BRANDON CARNEY 

Daily Sports Writer

Through its first three games, 

the Michigan men’s soccer team 
had developed a clear problem. The 
Wolverines were still evaluating 
their options for where their next 
goal was going to come from.

They had been shut out in two 

of their first three matches as they 
couldn’t figure out who was the 
best fit to lead their attacking line.

But two moments of brilliance 

just two minutes apart in the 
second half may have shined 
the light on the solution for the 
Wolverines.

Sophomore midfielder Francis 

Atuahene scored a low screamer 
off a corner just before senior 
forward Yamann Sahlool worked 
his way through the Yale defense 
to find a second, helping Michigan 
earn a 2-2 draw on Monday.

After falling a goal behind, 

Michigan coach Chaka Daley 
made the call to introduce 
Atuahene, who had missed the 
prior two matches while nursing 
an injury, and pair him with 
Sahlool to lead the attacking line.

As Atuahene subbed in, the 

Wolverine 
offense 
sparked 

to life after looking futile for 
the opening 60 minutes. His 
power 
and 

confidence 
were 
exactly 

what 
Michigan 
was 
missing 

not 
only 
in 

the first half 
of 
Monday’s 

match, 
but 

through 
the 

prior 
three 

matches of the season.

“I thought the person who 

changed the game was when 
(Atuahene) came on,” Daley said. 
(Atuahene and Sahlool) have the 
license to interchange and go 
from one spot to another within 
the front three. They did a good 
job with their movement to make 

things exciting.”

Daley has experimented with 

several different combinations at 
the head of the Wolverines’ attack. 
On Friday against Columbia, 
Daley chose to start sophomore 
defender 
Marcello 
Borges 

at 
striker. 
Borges’ 
footwork 

allows him to make a difference 
wherever he’s positioned, but as 
he showed over the weekend with 
10 missed shots, finishing is still 
an area he needs some work in to 
be considered a regular option as 
Michigan’s number nine.

On Sunday, Michigan started 

redshirt sophomore midfielder 
Michael 
Kapitula 
at 
striker 

against the Bulldogs, but he 
looked uncomfortable from the 
start, lasting just 33 minutes at 
the spot.

“(Kapitula and Borges) are 

capable and dangerous players,” 
Daley 
said. 
“I 
think 
their 

movement is good and they 
create chances. Certainly as we 
go we don’t look against anybody. 
Every team is a little different.”

Kapitula and Borges both 

lacked the physicality to get past 
Yale’s central defenders, which 
forced Daley to make the two 
changes that would make the 
difference against Yale. Sahlool 
came on and began holding the 

ball 
up 
for 

wingers 
like 

Borges to make 
runs.

The 

Wolverines’ 
attack 
looked 

more 
lively 

and dangerous 
with the senior 
forward on the 
field, but still 

lacked the finishing ability in the 
final third to find a breakthrough. 
Sahlool looked comfortable in his 
role and that carried over to his 
quality of play.

“I feel like playing center 

forward is really good for me,” 
Sahlool said. “I’m a guy who likes 
to make short runs in behind 

the defense just to be dangerous 
or get in the box and just get as 
many shots off as I can. I think 
the number nine is my best 
position. I like to shoot and score 
when I can. It’s what I’ve been 
doing since I was a little boy.”

Once Michigan had fallen 

behind, Daley knew he was 
going to have to make a risky 
substitution by bringing on an 
unfit 
Atuahene, 
but 
holding 

out on the change for so long 
may have made the difference. 
The 
sophomore 
midfielder 

was a constant menace for the 
defenders marking him and put 
on a convincing display on why 
he should be the Wolverines’ 
go-to scorer once fully healthy.

“I think Francis is a top player 

and he’s capable of playing five or 
six spots within the team,” Daley 
said. “We’ll continue to find his 
niche because he’s becoming 
more and more of a mark man. 
They put a man on him and man 
marked him the entire time he 
was on.”

After 
this 
weekend’s 

performance, Daley has a strong 
case for Sahlool and Atuahene 
leading the attack heading into 
conference play.

“We know Sahlool can hold up 

the ball real well and Atuahene 
can go score goals up top with his 
speed,” Borges said. “I think they 
are our goal scorers on the team, 
and we know if we can find them 
in the right places, they’ll score 
their goals.”

WOMEN’S SOCCER
Kastroll recovers 
from early injury

By BRAD WHIPPLE 

Daily Sports Editor

At one point during the 

Michigan women’s soccer team’s 
2-0 win against Ole Miss on 
Friday night, Abby Kastroll 
stopped moving, put her hands 
above her head and tried to catch 
her breath.

The 
sophomore 
midfielder 

had been all over the pitch — 
beating out any counterattack, 
heading balls and sliding for 
loose passes to clear the ball. 
Kastroll appeared unstoppable, 
but even she needed a substitute 
and came out of the game in the 
30th minute.

After 
the 
halftime 
break 

concluded, Kastroll took the field 
again for the next 45 minutes. As 
the Rebels began an offensive 
onslaught in an attempt to 
rebound from a two-goal deficit, 
the Wolverines couldn’t afford 
to have her off the field, and 
Kastroll remained steadfast on 
defense for the rest of the match.

Kastroll’s exhaustion wasn’t a 

matter of her needing to improve 
her stamina. Rather, it was a sign 
of how strong of a player she is 
becoming — one who will give 
100 percent for any minute she is 
on the pitch.

The 76 minutes she played 

against Ole Miss were no different, 
and they earned her praise from 
Michigan coach Greg Ryan after 
the game when Ryan approached 
Kastroll and said, “This was a 
breakout night for you.”

“She hasn’t had that night yet 

this year, where she just imposes 
her will on the game from 
an attacking and a defending 
standpoint,” 
Ryan 
said. 
“I 

thought she dominated every 
matchup she went into tonight.”

Kastroll’s stellar performance 

Friday is not an outlier when 

compared to how instrumental 
she has been in the team’s 
success thus far, though. On Aug. 
28 against then-No. 12 Notre 
Dame, she put Michigan on the 
scoreboard first with a header in 
the 64th minute.

After redshirt junior forward 

Ani Sarkisian headed a slow ball 
toward the net, Notre Dame 
goalkeeper 
Ginny 
McGowan 

was primed to make the save. 
Kastroll, though, was positioned 
right in front of the net, and with 
no more than a split-second to 
react, she threw her head up and 
backward to head the ball just 
past McGowan.

Three 
days 
before 
that 

matchup, Kastroll also assisted 
on half of the Wolverines’ four 
goals against Marshall.

Kastroll has had an impressive 

showing of late, all of which came 
after she was injured during the 
preseason. Since Michigan began 
training on Aug. 3, the team 
hasn’t had much time off.

“We haven’t been able to 

rest her, so she just had to plow 
through it,” Ryan said after 
Friday’s win. “But I think she’s 
finally feeling really recovered 
from that injury. She looked 
really strong tonight.”

Luckily for Kastroll and the 

rest of the Wolverines, they were 
rewarded with a two-day rest 
period after their game Friday — 
a rarity in college soccer.

“They’re tired,” Ryan said. 

“This is huge rest for us. Then 
it’s just getting ready to come out 
and compete like we competed 
tonight against UC Riverside and 
then into the Big Ten season.”

So far, Kastroll’s success has 

come without an extra day of rest, 
so there’s no telling what kind of 
show she and the Wolverines 
could put on this Friday at U-M 
Soccer Stadium.

“I feel like 

playing center 
forward is really 

good for me.”

Onwenu contributing on both sides

True freshman 
375-pounder 

making his mark in 
more ways than one

By JACOB GASE 

Daily Sports Editor

Weighing in at 375 pounds — 

and looking like every bit of it 
up close — freshman offensive 
lineman Michael Onwenu is the 
biggest player on the Michigan 
football team, and not by a 
small margin.

But what does a player like 

him eat to build that hulking, 
muscle-bound frame?

“I don’t know, I like grapes,” 

Onwenu said with a straight 
face. “I like fruit, so, I just eat 
a lot of fruit. I swear, I don’t 
even eat as much as people 
think I do. … I don’t eat a lot of 
junk food, just whatever I feel 
like eating.”

Whether you believe his 

dietary habits or not, Onwenu 
has already been given a chance 
to put his impressive size to 
good use early in his first season 
with the Wolverines. Saturday, 
he was one of a team-record 
17 true freshmen to make his 
collegiate debut for Michigan in 
a 63-3 win over Hawaii.

Onwenu may be part of a 

loaded recruiting class, but since 
enrolling in classes over the 
summer, the Detroit Cass Tech 
product stood out enough for 
coach Jim Harbaugh to grant 
him the opportunity to practice 
on both the offensive and 
defensive lines — and play both 
in his first game as well.

When he took the field at 

Michigan Stadium for the first 
time as an offensive lineman, 
Onwenu said “it didn’t feel 
real.” Little did he know that, 
due in part to the defensive line 
dealing with numerous injuries 
Saturday, he ended up playing 
both ways right off the bat.

Onwenu had been a two-way 

player all through high school 
— offense more than defense — 
but he says he has no preference 
for which way he lines up, as 

long as it gets him on the field.

“I’ve always played both, so 

I really don’t have a favorite,” 
Onwenu said. “Even going into 
the 
future, 

I feel like I 
could 
play 

both. … I’ve 
always played 
offense more 
than defense, 
but I feel like 
I can be better 
at defense. I 
just have to 
get consistent 
with my technique. When I 
get consistent, I feel like I’ll be 
dominant.”

It’s a unique position to be in 

for a young lineman — Onwenu 
said that ever since Harbaugh 

first started recruiting him, 
the prospect of playing both 
ways has always been on the 
table. When Onwenu went 

to 
camps 

with 
other 

top 
recruits 

from around 
the 
country, 

he said even 
players 
ranked 
higher 
than 

him 
didn’t 

have such an 
opportunity 

from their coaches.

Part of the reason for that is 

his natural speed, which seems 
counterintuitive 
given 
his 

stature.

“I’ve never been little, but I 

always had a little quickness,” 
Onwenu 
said. 
“Even 
when 

I played little league, I was 
always kind of the fastest big 
guy. Now I’ve gained more 
pounds, so — I mean, I still try 
to be as fast as I was, but I just 
try.”

Natural 
talents 
aside, 

Onwenu also has a high-quality 
training staff and nutritionist 
at his disposal to maintain his 
imposing form. Neither he nor 
the coaching staff has a set 
weight in mind, but Director of 
Performance Fergus Connolly 
has been a helpful guide.

“I’ve got Fergus — that’s my 

man,” Onwenu said. “Even in 
the summer, when I was trying 
to figure out how to lose pounds 
and gain more muscle, he was 

just telling me tricks and tips, 
what I can do. Not so much 
losing weight, just like trying to 
fix what I’m eating — eat more 
healthy stuff or make better 
choices.”

Whatever choices Onwenu 

is making seem to be the right 
ones. As a freshman once 
touted “my favorite guy right 
now” by Harbaugh earlier in 
camp, he figures to see more 
playing time in the coming 
weeks as the defensive line 
continues to heal and the 
Wolverines take on more low-
level competition.

His weight may jump out 

on paper, but the fruit-fueled 
lineman with deceptive speed 
has more to offer his new team 
on both sides of the ball.

Peppers happy in Brown’s defense

Michigan’s most 
versatile player 

happy with results 

after first game

By MAX BULTMAN 

Managing Sports Editor

Jabrill Peppers says he tries 

to lay low going to classes. He 
doesn’t wear football gear, hoping 
it will help him avoid attention.

On a football field, though, 

laying low is impossible.

No. 
5 
is 
everywhere 
on 

Michigan’s defense and special 
teams, and presumably, he’ll see 
time on offense at some point as 
well. He plays in the box, in the 
secondary, on the line and perhaps 
in the nightmares of various 
coaches around the Big Ten.

He opened 2016 with a tackle 

for loss on the first play from 
scrimmage, and logic suggests 
there will be more tone-setting 
plays to come. That’s because, 
under new defensive coordinator 
Don Brown, aggressive play 
calling is the new normal.

“He’s 
a 
very 
aggressive 

defensive caller, so we just make 
him look good, try to make him 
as right as possible with anything 
he calls, even if it puts us at a 
disadvantage,” Peppers said. “We 
just try to make them look good, 
man. Because he trusts us, he 
lets us go out there and play, and 
that’s the least we could do.”

When 
Brown 
came 
to 

Michigan from Boston College, 
he showed Peppers film of Matt 
Milano, the Eagles’ version of 
Peppers from last season. He 
wanted to show the versatile 
defensive back how he would 
be used in his defense. And one 
game into the season, Peppers 
seems 
sufficiently 
impressed 

with his new coach.

“Once we all really got the 

defense, and started adding 
our own swagger and our own 

attitude to it, man, it was just 
clicking,” Peppers said.

Peppers, of course, is the 

linchpin. If he was not already 
the most indispensable, he likely 
is now after his backup, Noah 
Furbush, went down with an 
undisclosed injury. There are 
players behind Peppers, but none 
can alter the game in nearly as 
many ways.

He said much of his job is 

similar — though he plays in the 
box much more — but Peppers 
now said he considers himself 
savvier than a year ago.

“Like down and distance 

situations, 
reading 
the 

quarterback’s 
drops, 
reading 

the receivers’ releases,” he said. 
“Now I’m in the box, reading the 
guard pull, reading the down 
block. Just things like that. And I 
just feel as though, like a lot of us 

do, we’ve just been here before. 
We know what we’ve gotta do, so 
let’s just go out there and do it.”

That manifested as a strong 

day against Hawaii. Peppers had 
eight tackles, two for loss and one 
sack as part of 
a unit that held 
the 
Rainbow 

Warriors 
to 

just 
three 

points. 
The 

Wolverines 
scored on two 
interceptions 
returned 
for 

touchdowns, 
and 
they 

forced another 
fumble. It was as strong a 
defensive day as Michigan fans 
could have hoped for.

But even though Hawaii put 

together only one long drive in the 

first half — with mostly starters 
in the game for the Wolverines — 
Peppers wasn’t entirely content. 
When the Rainbow Warriors 
made their field goal, it curtailed 
his hope of a season-opening 

shutout.

“We 

wanted to shut 
those 
guys 

out,” he said. 
“We 
wanted 

to just come 
out and make 
a 
statement. 

We’ve seen a 
lot of teams 
struggle 
in 

week 
one. 

We feel as though we had the 
hardest camp. We feel as though 
we’ve got the best head guy. So 
we just want to go out there and 
make a statement no matter who 

we play.”

On that drive, Peppers said 

Hawaii 
simply 
called 
good 

plays 
to 
match 
up 
against 

Michigan’s scheme. He said the 
Rainbow 
Warriors 
exploited 

Michigan’s gaps, leaving room 
for quarterback Ikaika Woolsey 
to scramble and complete passes.

He was willing to concede 

that some success was expected 
(“You know they’re gonna 
make plays, this is Division I 
football,” he said,) but he also 
wants them to keep contain 
better and “gap integrity.”

Still, 
what 
Michigan 
did 

against Hawaii worked. And 
Peppers knows it.

“If they don’t score, and you 

keep taking the ball over and 
putting points on the board,” 
Peppers said, “you should like 
your chances.”

GRANT HARDY/Daily

Redshirt sophomore Jabrill Peppers is the most versatile player in Don Brown’s new defense, and early results from him in his new position were positive.

AMANDA ALLEN/Daily

Freshman lineman Michael Onwenu earned the chance to play on the offensive and defensive lines, and Jim Harbaugh earlier called him one of his favorite players.

“I’ve never 

been little, but 
I always had a 
little quickness.”

“We wanted 
to just come 
out and make 
a statement.”

I

’m alive, and therefore I sweat.

At a young age I learned to merge those two 

gross activities into an ipso-facto literary equa-

tion à la Descartes. I don’t fancy myself a philosopher, 
though, unless of course Descartes sweat. Which he 
probably did, because he was alive. Then, ipso facto, I 
am a philosopher. See how that works?

Regardless, there’s something about summer that 

turns me into a deep, perspiring thinker. Maybe it’s 
the freedom I have to mentally romp. In college, we’re 
bestowed an almost-four-month hiatus when it starts 
to get warm outside, during which we swap five-page 
papers for glossy internships or charming little mun-
dane jobs or traveling. And in all of this, there is luxury; 
there is time.

Time Is On My Side — The Rolling Stones

The original frenemy, free time lends to both pro-

gressive and toxic thoughts. My marvelous mind can 
choose to be productive one day in, say, the thick of 
June — but it can spiral into existential wah-wah when 
August rolls around and the looming promise of school 
hangs in the air like an upcoming date with a really hot 
guy. Once you’re on the date, it’s great, but the car ride 
to the restaurant is sticky, sticky agony.

Wah-Wah — George Harrison

So how do we stop this sun-induced cacophony? 

George Harrison hated the way “Wah-Wah” turned 
out. Producer Phil Spector did his job and produced the 
shit out of it, and the result reeks of endless tinkering 
and mixing and adding. But there’s an inherent beauty 
to the song’s raw chord progression. The way it falls 
then picks up, kind of telling us to do the same. So when 
we shake off all the chachkis — the bad thoughts, the 
uncertainty, the tinkering — things sound pretty OK.

I get a little bit of bass added to my song when a 

stranger compliments my necklace and I let him. And 
the drums come when I tell him to have a great day. A 
groove starts when I inhale mango gelato with some 
high school friends, and we laugh at freshman-year 
roommates and Melania Trump’s marshmallow dress. 
The summer sweat goes away here, and I don’t miss a 
drop of it.

But some summers — some lucky, muggy, unsuspect-

ing summers — you get a guitar solo. It happens at a 
music festival. You meet a guy (we’ll call mine Detroit 
Denzel) who also loves the Pixies and understands the 
beauty and essentiality of Mark Rothko. And you kiss 
him, to M83, possibly the most underwhelming indie-
pop band of all time. But what the hell.

Do It, Try It — M83

Kissing Detroit Denzel felt like a symphony, like 

every silly problem of mine melted away and all that 
was left was colors. After the festival, we kept seeing 
each other, and the city was ours to peel. There was so 
much to uncover: What makes Detroit tick? What made 
us tick? What was his favorite movie, his dog’s name, 
his biggest fear?

Are You That Somebody — Aaliyah

Everything was fresh. I knew it might end, like sum-

mer might end, but I didn’t care because the thought 
of having even a moment with him was endlessly more 
delicious than the comfort of inaction. And I think it 
was love, but that might be those simmering nights in 
the passenger seat of his car talking. So maybe it’s good 
to leave it all there, simmering, living.

Age of Consent — New Order

One scorching day, DD and I were at a concert. The 

sun aggressively streamed into my eyes as I blabbered 
about my dreams and the future, diving into that sum-
mer-existential abyss again, and DD patiently listened. 
I solidified, unwittingly, the nature of our fling when 
I blurted out that I wanted to move to New York next 
summer, and possibly for the rest of my life. I expected 
him to freak, or to get mopey and shut down completely. 
Instead, he looked me dead in the eye, his brown ones 
tiny and steady as the fact of knowing that the seasons 
change, and he opened his bearded mouth:

“I dare you.”
And I started to sweat, and it felt great.

T

his summer, I had the wonderful opportunity to 
study abroad in Grenoble, France, for six weeks, 
take classes in French and live with a French 

family. Considering my prospects for internships after 
my sophomore year were low, I thought it would be 
something to do. I spent the last three summers working 
in a restaurant in my hometown, and I knew I couldn’t 
do that for another summer. This seemed like a compro-
mise: Yeah, I’d have to take classes, 
but at least I wouldn’t be home for 
the whole summer, and — as an added 
bonus — I’d be in France.

Little did I know how much this 

“compromise” would change my life.

Upon arriving in Grenoble, the tran-

sition felt shocking. Born in Belgium, 
and as a citizen of the United King-
dom, I grew up moving around the 
world. I was used to being a foreigner 
and addressing home as somewhere far 
away. However, being completely alone 
in a foreign place seemed odd and out 
of place. I hadn’t slept very well on the 
plane and hadn’t had a proper meal 
in more than 12 hours. Fatigue was 
setting in and now I was required to 
speak to a family I’d never met before 
in a language I hadn’t spoken since fall 
semester.

The first few weeks went by, and 

the language started to settle in more 
naturally. Rather than thinking and 
rehearsing everything I was going to 
say beforehand, the words started to 
roll off my tongue and my comprehen-
sion of everyday language rose dramat-
ically. Instead of feeling uncomfortable 
and embarrassed about every social 
interaction, I started to become at ease. 
I was learning every day, and watching 
my own progress was inspiring; I knew 
I had to be brave, initiate conversation 
and accept the fact that sometimes I 
would mess up. With this realization, 

and some practice under my belt, I began to fall in love 
with the French culture. A cheese plate every day after 
dinner? Sign me up.

The six weeks flew by, and the program ended before I 

was ready for it to be over. After taking classes in French, 
I was ready for a break from homework and studying. 
However, leaving France and returning to Michigan left 
me feeling sad. This great adventure I embarked on had 

gone by so quickly. I was learning so much every day, and 
now that was over and I’d be returning to my normal life. 
I love my life in Ann Arbor, but closing one chapter and 
starting another made me feel a small and tugging sense 
of grief.

As I sit here writing in Ann Arbor, I’m aware of how 

constantly I think of the differences in culture, the 
things I learned, and I notice the ways that I’ve changed. 

Grenoble surprised me, as I found myself 
outside of my comfort zone in a really cool 
way. Going abroad not only allowed me 
to gain insight on a new way of life, but it 
also gave me a lens through which I could 
observe my own culture. I am appreciat-
ing things about Michigan that I never 
noticed before. For example, we will strike 
up a conversation in any setting with any 
person. In the grocery store and picking 
up a certain brand of orange juice? Some 
nice lady next to you will probably tell you 
that’s her favorite too. We like to connect 
and communicate, which is something 
unique to American culture I never really 
noticed before.

If you have the opportunity to study 

abroad, do it. No questions asked — just do 
it. It’s expensive and difficult to squeeze 
in, but find a way to make it work. In our 
busy lives, we rarely take the moments to 
expand our understanding of the world 
and experience it in a different way. We 
are so focused on school, working, get-
ting good grades, staying active, eating 
healthy, socializing, maintaining accept-
able levels of social media presence — all 
while trying to stay sane. Studying abroad 
is scary, and that’s awesome. It gives you 
the chance to put your routine on pause 
and see how you can cope in a foreign set-
ting. And finding out that you can is pow-
erful and motivating. As I move on to my 
junior year after Grenoble, I feel so blessed 
to have had this opportunity to grow and 
learn more about the person I strive to be.

accounts for certain sites that ask for a Face-
book login, rather than providing the opportu-
nity to make your own or use a Google login. 
But these difficulties are not enough to force 
him to join the website with 1.7 billion users.

The distaste for online relationships, Ellison 

said, is one of three reasons cited for people 
who do not have Facebook accounts. Ellison’s 
work focuses on the benefits of the social net-
work, but she pointed to other research being 
done to specifically note why some people 
choose not to have Facebook accounts.

“We’re at the point now where on a college 

campus if you’re not on Facebook, it’s probably 
because you have some reason,” Ellison said. 
“It’s not just that you haven’t heard about it.”

The other two reasons cited by those with-

out accounts include fearing productivity con-
cerns and privacy issues — as Ellison puts it: 
“what one particular company is doing with 
my data once it’s out there.”

LSA senior Katrina Rayment’s reasons have 

shifted from adolescence to young adulthood. 
At first, she struggled socially in middle and 
high school, meaning “I did not want to adver-
tise how few friends I had.” Now Rayment has 
plenty of pictures she could be tagged in. It’s 
just that she sees Facebook as a waste of time.

“Other people have told me how much time 

they spend on this one thing and that just 
seems, like, really unappealing,” Rayment 
said. “I already spend so much time wasted 
browsing the Internet; I don’t need to add, like, 
another distraction.”

The average person spends 50 minutes 

every day on Facebook, according to The New 
York Times. That’s more time than the aver-
age American spends on educational activities, 
grooming themselves, house care and real-life 
face-to-face communication, according to the 
widely cited Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Time 
Use Survey. Of all leisure activities, only televi-
sion takes up more of our time.

For college students in particular, this can 

manifest into a larger problem of procrastina-
tion. It’s a real issue — writing this article alone, 
I frequently find myself opening up a new tab 
of the site almost unconsciously. Facebook’s 
distracting qualities are so prevalent that 
researchers Adrian Meier, Leonard Reinecke 
and Christine Meltzer at the Johannes Guten-
berg University in Germany came up with 
aname for it: Facebocrastination.

Public Policy senior Graham Steffens said 

Facebook began to “go out of style” when he 
was a senior in high school. He hasn’t looked 
back since deleting his in 2013.

“I definitely have more time,” Steffens said. 

“The amount of time spent scrolling through 
your newsfeed is incredible. You don’t realize 
how much time it takes until you delete it.”

If students like Jermyn and Steffens are 

fine without it, what keeps others logged on? 
Ninety percent of those aged 18 to 29 use social 

media, according to Pew. On college campus-
es, the primary way to hear about parties and 
other campus events happening is through 
Facebook invites. In my own experience, Face-
book Events and Facebook Groups seem essen-
tial for campus life.

Unsurprisingly, that’s the major drawback 

for Steffens and those who are Facebook-free.

“I wouldn’t get invited to events where 

other people would,” Steffens said. “It just took 
extra effort to kind of go out of my way to make 
sure I heard about those, or make plans with 
people if you actually want to hang out instead 
of just having like a third party to initiate that.”

Jermyn says to get invited to events he 

either has to go out of his way to get the infor-
mation or depend on his friends for an invite.

“Even just social things, like if people would 

be having parties or something they would 
create a Facebook event, say: ‘I’ll invite you on 
Facebook,’ and I would say: ‘Well, I don’t have 
a Facebook,’ ” he said. “I probably missed out 
on some social interactions because I didn’t 
have a Facebook and I kind of just rely on other 
people to text me if there was something going 
on.”

However, not seeing events or social inter-

actions via Facebook isn’t all negative.

Steffens said he realized after leaving Face-

book the effect staring at photos of parties he 
wasn’t invited to or vacations he didn’t go on 
has on users.

“I have an overall positive experience with-

out it,” Steffens said. “The lack of FOMO — 
that’s a big thing. People can get really stressed 
out constantly looking at other people’s lives 
and compare their own lives to it. Removing 
that aspect, I think makes a happier person.”

Facebook’s inherent voyeurism, and the jeal-

ousy that can result from it, is often lamented. 
However, Ellison, the social scientist, noted 
that as a perk.

“Facebook is a window to staying connected 

with friends in kind of a lightweight manner so 
that they’re able to see what others are doing 
and feel that there’s a connection even when 

they’re not co-located,” Ellison said.

As interesting as that can be, Ellison notes 

in the short term the feature can also aid in 
building connections in real life. While non-
users like Christoph may not know what their 
friends have been up to recently, Ellison says 
users have conversation starters when they see 
them in person.

“One of the ways that we talk about that in 

our work is by making an argument that Face-
book serves as a social lubricant, and the idea 
there is essentially the information that you 
see on Facebook can then be used to kind of 
make conversation happen more fluidly when 
you do communicate through some other 
channel,” she said.

Maybe a user sees a friend post about get-

ting a puppy or visiting a new restaurant; the 
next time the user sees their Facebook friend 
in person these are starting topics of conversa-
tion. This aspect makes Christoph understand 
the appeal of Facebook; he said he never knows 
what people are up to unless he sees them day 
to day or makes an effort to reach out to them.

“My relationships are more stuck in the 

timeframe that I’ve seen the person,” Chris-
toph said. “A lot of the people that I haven’t seen 
in a long time I have no idea what they’ve done 
in the last year or so, which is unfortunate. The 
thing with Facebook is that with Snapchat you 
can see what’s going on if you’re checking it, 
but with Facebook you can see what’s going on 
today and look back three weeks ago and check 
out everything up until when they created it in 
middle school.”

Yet Steffens’ feelings of FOMO associated 

with the barrage of information still aren’t 
unfounded. Psychology Prof. Ethan Kross 
published a study in 2013 linking avid Face-
book users to higher rates of depression. His 
researchers found the more people utilized the 
social network throughout the day, the more 
their mood declined.

“We find that the more users use Facebook 

passively — i.e., browsing the site without add-
ing content — the worse they subsequently 
feel,” Kross said. “We also have some data indi-
cating that one potential explanation for this 
relationship has to do with jealousy — brows-
ing the site passively is associated with higher 
feelings of jealousy, which in turn predict peo-
ple feeling worse over time. Some researchers 
have speculated that this is because people 
curate the way they appear online.”

Keeping in mind the curation factor Kross 

referred to, the constant sharing can also be 
too much. Christoph said hearing about this 
stress from his Facebook-using friends was a 
reason he never joined.

“I feel a little less cluttered,” Christoph said. 

“I hear people complaining that Facebook is 
boring and they don’t know why they use it. 
I know people that get worried about putting 
their vacation photos on Facebook and making 

sure to share all their study abroad photos and 
stuff, so it’s kind of like people feel obligated 
to update it and keep their presence online 
fresh and update everyone. For me I don’t 
really worry about posting photos or Facebook 
drama that’s happening. It’s one less thing to 
check. I don’t have to look for Facebook mes-
sages.”

Here the benefits of Facebook become one of 

its disadvantages — this rings true for college 
students passively Facebocrastinating to avoid 
studying.

A study done by Sven Laumer, an assis-

tant professor at Otto-Friedrich University in 
Germany, validated my annoyance with Face-
book’s constant, banal notifications: Many 
users see Facebook as a place of demands 
rather than a space for interesting content to 
be shared. Users complained of feeling social 
overload when on the site because of its social 
demands and obligations, such as wishing 
“friends” a happy birthday, promote or share 
content produced by other “friends,” contrib-
ute to their fundraisers or react to their sta-
tuses.

Jermyn currently doesn’t suffer from this 

stress, nor does he foresee ever having to.

“I find that without having a Facebook, I’m 

able to keep in touch with the people I really 
want to keep in touch with,” Jermyn said. 
“The other people who maybe I wasn’t as good 
of friends with or whatever in high school, if 
I really want to get in touch with them, I can 
get in touch with them, but I don’t think that I 
really need a Facebook to make sure that I can 
do that.”

Sure, Jermyn will be the only classmate at 

his high school reunion shocked at how his 
classmates have aged. He may miss seeing 
where his acquaintances went over Spring 
Break, or hearing about so-and-so’s new job, 
but he’s content. The Facebook-less are fine 
without it; despite being disconnected online, 
they’d still pass on an online interaction to one 
face-to-face.

W

hen Will Jermyn was in seventh 
grade, he did what many 2007 mid-
dle schoolers did — he set up a Face-

book account.

But unlike most other 7th-graders, the Face-

book Jermyn created was for his mom, not 
himself. Jermyn, a Public Policy junior, used 
his email to make it. He didn’t know many oth-
ers on the site at the time and thought it would 
be too much effort to create a new email.

Jermyn has cycled through several new 

email accounts in the nine years since then, 
but he still hasn’t found a reason to create a 
Facebook. As the popularity of the social net-
work grew and more of his classmates used the 
site to organize events after school or created 
groups for clubs, he considered making one 
but found he was always fine without it. He 
said he has realized at times that his life would 
be easier with an account, but the extra work 
that came with not having one — like having to 
go out of his way to make sure he knew about 
events happening — didn’t outweigh his feeling 
that it wasn’t essential.

“I just never really decided to get one,” he 

said. “There were definitely a lot of instances 
where I was like, I should have one with differ-
ent clubs and stuff and different teams. Using 
Facebook was kind of like a big way that every-
one communicated.”

Jermyn is outgoing, but prefers to stay in. He 

has a good group of core friends, whom he says 
he relies on to hear about things going on on 
campus — whether they be events or the daily 
doings of one’s friends. The ubiquity of Face-
book as a tool for communication is something 
Information Prof. Nichole Ellison studies at the 
University of Michigan. She said its popularity 
and utility have made it a “common language,” 
but also come with the drawbacks of the hav-
ing a life online: how much time it takes. 

“Facebook is kind of one-stop shopping,” 

Ellison said. “For many people, that’s where 
all their friends are. So you have the cell phone 
numbers of some of your friends, but not all, 
or you’re on Snapchat with some of them, but 
not all, but Facebook is kind of like a common 
language. Facebook does of course have these 
coordination features, like planning events, 
that kind of lower the barrier to that kind of 
work.”

I had the opposite experience of Jermyn: 

In seventh grade, my mom set up my account. 
Today, the way I utilize Facebook has shifted — 
as I’m sure it has for most users as the site has 
moved to expand. It’s gone from a place where 
my double-digit amount of classmates post-
ed gawky photos and messaged after school 
before I had a phone, to what is now essentially 
a database of everyone I know. The ability to 
“unfollow” users makes it more personable, but 
the experience is less genuine. Though there’s 
nothing which particularly attracts me to the 
site, it’s hard to imagine life without it. I am 

not a fan of memes or 30-second cooking tuto-
rials, nor do I enjoy flipping through tagged 
photos of people from my middle school. Day 
to day, Facebook for me is often banal. Log on, 
see the same active users, hear about an event, 
check my notifications, close browser. It’s not 
an activity I want to do, need to do, or look 
forward to doing, it’s something I just do. It’s 
normal.

Even the activity of keeping up with 1,200 

Facebook “friends” can be exhausting, with 
the exhausting yet ultimately appealing voy-
eurism that is Facebook stalking. There is also 
the issue of fretting about one’s own appear-
ance — the fundamentally fruitless concerns 
over how many “likes” a new profile picture or 
status receives. These are social anxieties that, 
regardless of Facebook, we all experience, but 
are amplified on the site.

Jermyn has never had to deal with that. 

His friends are actually his friends, and he’s 
not pretending to have a four-digit amount of 
them.

“One aversion to Facebook that I’ve had is it 

is very easy to connect with people and the idea 
of having thousands and thousands of friends 
or something — I don’t know if I ever really 
liked that kind of idea,” Jermyn said. “For me, 
I’m more about having a few close friends that 
you text with and that you hang out with on 
a regular basis instead of having this large, 
expansive network that’s maybe people that 
you aren’t as willing to hang out with frequent-
ly, maybe you see them like once every now and 
then, but not on a regular basis.”

He added that if a club or a job required him 

to make one, he would, but for personal use, 
probably not. He’s content with the friends 
he has in real life, and doesn’t understand the 
appeal of having lots of “friends” online.

Yet Facebook seems critical; for many, it’s 

hard to imagine a world without it. Whenev-
er a new social media app is created, it seems 
Facebook ends up buying it — take how Face-
book Live emulated Periscope, or how mov-
ing Messenger to a separate app put it at odds 
with other popular messaging applications like 
Whatsapp. The site bought out picture-sharing 
app Instagram in 2012 and recently launched 
“Instagram stories,” mimicking the opera-
tives of Snapchat. According to a Pew survey 
conducted in September 2014, Facebook is the 
most used social media site.

That ubiquity has made lives like LSA junior 

Hiro Christoph’s difficult, even in minor ways. 
I was surprised he didn’t have a Facebook — 
he’s an RA, known for being personable and 
kind. Christoph seems like the kind of person 
who would get hundreds of likes on his profile 
picture. Influenced by his parents, who were 
always adamantly against him having a Face-
book, he never logged on.

He noted that he has faced some difficulties 

not having one, such as being unable to make

W

e’re always told that this is 
the prime of our life, this 
college thing. I believe the 

elusive, omnipotent “they” who dic-
tate generalizations similar to the one 
above — They always say ignorance is 
bliss! — are right. This is a prime.

OK, thanks for reading. Goodbye.
Kidding, of course, because what in 

the name of Jim Harbaugh’s dad bod is 
a “prime?” A sexual prime may differ 
from, say, an artistic prime in a themat-
ic sense, but at their core the “eras” are 
the same: periods of heightened suc-
cess and gusto and freedom to flourish. 
And the flourishing happens, without 
abandon.

Currently, I am a sponge — a con-

fident albeit quasi-existential junior 
in college who loves music and talk-
ing to other humans, who realizes she 
still has a lot to soak in, interpret and 
squeeze out in practice. A sexy sponge.

This absorbent female feels she is 

ready to begin living with abandon, 
as one would in their prime — but she 
hasn’t been lately. The combo platter 
of a brand new year, a new apartment, 
new impending classes, etc. is thrill-
ing, yet my already messy mind has 
been on overdrive, swimming in self-
doubt. I have been forgetting to let go 
and breathe, to stop and smell my sur-
roundings, to kick out the jams. I am 
having fun, as the kids say, but I don’t 
think I am in my prime right now.

So to feel sponge-ier I like to think 

about cool people in their prime. 
When I wrote “kick out the jams” a 
few precious words ago, my unathlet-
ic self was referring to the 1969 song 
by Detroit punk-rockers MC5 (whom 
I’ve blabbered about before). These 
five hungry gentlemen would smash a 
Detroit venue called the Grande Ball-
room every week in the late ‘60s. The 
concert hall’s ornate Art Deco interior 
and sweeping wooden dance floor — 
now derelict — housed hundreds of 
countercultural young guns back in 
the day. They swayed, sweated, loved 
and drugged as MC5 wailed, rambled 
and rocked. And then the next Friday 
night would roll around, and they’d 
do it all over again. I pine for ’69 and a 
Grande prime.

The rest of MC5’s discography, 

post-debut album (recorded live at the 
Grande), is underwhelming for a band 
with such a ferocious start. In this case, 
“prime” is synonymous with “peak” — 
and that duo’s very nature insinuates 
an artistic high point can only be hit 
once. And though the zenith is sweet 
and gnarly and sonic, it is deafeningly 
singular.

But can prime be plural? Can we 

have more than one Grande Ballroom 
in this life? The problem is I’ve had a 
few primes already, and I know I want 
more. I hit a prime at the end of fresh-
man year, when everything about Ann 
Arbor became familiar. My adoration 
for this city transitioned from a fresh 
crush to a candle-lit love — my writ-
ing seemed to pour out of me, and my 
fellow students felt like fellow con-
cert-goers. The noises of these streets 
sounded like an MC5 song.

Nowadays, it’s a little harder to 

write, for whatever reason. I fell out 
of the Ballroom a few months ago and 
became a bit of a realist. College ends 
in a little less than two years — what 
will I do? Who will I be? Where will 
I be?

I’ll be moving away from my home-

town of Detroit, in the hopes of broad-
ening my horizons and finding work in 
journalism: This much I know. I’ll be 
away from the actual location of the 
Grande Ballroom. And I’ll be moving 
away from Ann Arbor, inevitably — the 
location of my second Grande Ball-
room. Where the next Ballroom is, I’m 
not quite sure.

It could be in New York, where inspi-

ration pops out of skyscrapers by the 
droves, or Los Angeles, where Charles 
Bukowski changed the definition of 
prime living (read: sloppy booze and 
sleazy women and delicious poems). 
Location has the power to inspire such 
eras, obviously.

Yet, that’s just the thing: What is 

Ann Arbor to my own mind, location-
wise? Maybe I am the person, place 
and thing who ignites my primes, and 
has all along. Maybe I have the power 
to build a Grande Ballroom whenever 
and wherever I want — construct my 
own wooden dance floor and sum-
mon a band of characters to fill it with 
lovely dissonance. Maybe I’m the lead 
singer of MC5, and maybe it’s time for 
me to stop worrying and start giving 
myself the freedom to flourish, with-
out abandon. Maybe I will right now.

I recognize that sometimes the latter 

choice will give me a full-on Ballroom, 
and sometimes it will not. But as I sit 
steps away from The Ark at dusk, with 
these words coming out a little easi-
er than before, my heart is bubbling 
— this I can’t deny. Whether that’s a 
fabulous prime coming, or a fabulous 
nothing on its way, I’ll be here, allow-
ing myself many great songs to play on 
my own steady, steady stage.

F

or the longest time, I let myself 
love a life I was never meant to 
live. I’m a cradle Catholic and 

regularly attended Mass at the church 
my family has gone to for more than 50 
years. I received sacraments through-
out childhood. I wanted my marriage 
to be recognized by God in the church. 
But recently, I’ve let all of these expec-
tations go because I’ve finally accepted 
the fact that I’m gay.

All my life, I’ve grown up listening 

to homophobic slurs, jokes, television 
shows, music, propaganda, opinions, 
essays, ideologies, hate groups, reli-
gions, businesses — and eventually I 
just got tired of it.

Even as a little kid, I was exposed 

to the world’s intolerance: When I 
lived in Illinois in the third grade, one 
of my new classmates told everyone I 
was gay, and I ate lunch alone for the 
following three weeks. I remember 
hearing a classmate in middle school 
jokingly talk about forming a hate 
group to kill gay people. While debat-
ing social issues and LGBTQ rights in 
high school, my classmates were ada-
mant that homosexuality is a chosen 

“lifestyle,” and that no one is born that 
way and that it is a disgusting, unnatu-
ral, perverted existence.

Though I’ve known for the longest 

time — and have been in denial — I 
never had the courage to give up the 
life that was so easily laid out for me. 
I wanted to be married in the same 
church my parents and grandparents 
were married in. I wanted to easily 
have kids of my own. I wanted to live a 
life without fear.

I’ve only recently found the strength 

to accept who I am. This spring, I had 
the privilege of going into the woods 
of New Hampshire with a University 
of Michigan program called NELP,

I wanted my 
marriage to be 
recognized by 

God in the church.

Straight Expectations

the New England Literature Program. 
It’s an intentional community, a space 
built to foster teamwork and coopera-
tion. Everyone, including the instruc-
tors, works together to sustain our 
little community in the forest for 45 
days. Without easy access to the rest of 
the world, everyone tends to be pres-
ent.

At the beginning of my stay in New 

Hampshire, I was asked why I came 
to the woods, and it’s been something 
I’ve been turning over in my mind ever 
since. I went into the woods with no 
clear objective. It is now easy for me to 
see I needed the time away, the space 
to think, the silence to hear, the capac-
ity to listen and the opportunity to be 
kind.

The woods offered me the first time 

to personally know gay people who 
were out, successful and happy. For the 
first time, I met gay people who were 
both professionally and socially thriv-
ing in the real world. I finally found an 
accurate representation of the life I’d 
been avoiding out of the fear of letting 
go of the one I’d let myself idealize for 
too long.

And while those woods will always 

be a special place for me, the idea at 
the end of the program is to return.

In my case, coming back and return-

ing were two very different things. 
I came back from the woods on June 
17, but I finally returned sometime in 
August.

Returning meant living a more delib-

erate life, being more self-reliant and 
letting go of the expectations I set for 
myself for as long as I can remember. 
Living a lie did no one any good. No 
one I knew really knew who I was, 

and it was incredibly lonely. It’s only 
after having seen other strong queer 
people that I’ve come to terms with my 
faith, my lack of representation in the 
church, the way I’ll be marginalized in 
society and the people who will choose 
to be left behind.

Letting go sucks. It’s taken me forev-

er to realize this, but the expectations 
of the ideal life I’d created in my mind 
were unhealthy. There are people in 
this world who will always be angered 
and disappointed by the fact that I’m 
gay. I don’t have to be one of them.

For the first time, I met 

gay people who were 

both professionally and 

socially thriving in the 

real world.
