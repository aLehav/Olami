Update 1/8: The University 
of Michigan has updated its 
COVID-19 dashboard to reflect 
an 
increase 
in 
quarantine 
housing availability. University 
spokesperson Rick Fitzgerald 
wrote in an email to The Daily 
that the increase reflects the 
University’s 
plan 
to 
house 
two students in two-bedroom 
quarantine 
housing 
spaces. 
Previously, 
each 
apartment 
housed 
only 
one 
student, 
regardless 
of 
how 
many 
bedrooms it had.
When LSA freshman Ruide Xu 
— who lives in South Quadrangle 
residence hall — tested positive 
for COVID-19 on Wednesday, his 
first thought was to contact the 
quarantine housing hotline — 
only to be met with no response 
after multiple calls and emails.
“We doubted if (the University 
of Michigan) has (sic) enough 
quarantine 
housing,” 
Xu 
said. “It feels like they’ve got 
very bad communication and 
management there and people 
are getting really confused when 
they need help.”
Eventually, Xu said he was 
able to contact a representative 
from the U-M Division of Public 
Safety and Security but was 
informed that he was not on the 
quarantine housing list despite 
being enrolled as a student living 
on campus who tested positive 
for COVID-19. As of Friday 
evening, Xu has still not been 
relocated to the University’s 
quarantine and isolation housing 
and has been living in his dorm 
awaiting further instructions.
Similar to Xu, other U-M 
students 
who 
have 
tested 
positive for COVID-19 have also 
struggled to find Q&I housing 
in light of the recent surge in 
positive COVID-19 cases. 
The increase in cases comes 
after the University announced 
they 
would 
be 
resuming 
in-person classes as scheduled 
on Jan. 5 despite calls for classes 
to be delayed or moved online 
for two weeks in response to 
the rapid spread of the omicron 
variant. Some instructors elected 
to e-pivot for the first two weeks 
of the semester. As of Friday, 
The University has reported 815 
positive COVID-19 cases for the 
week of Jan. 1. 
The updated Q&I policies 
exclude 
students 
living 
off 
campus 
from 
University-

provided 
accommodations, 
according to Vice President for 
Student Life Martino Harmon. 
In a Jan. 6 email to students, 
Harmon wrote students living off 
campus who contract COVID-19 
should “remain in residence” or 
“relocate to another residence, 
such as a permanent residence” 
for the duration of the isolation 
period. Harmon also said Q&I 
housing was 11.5% occupied.
University 
spokesperson 
Rick Fitzgerald wrote in an 
email to The Michigan Daily 
the University was anticipating 
an increase in demand for 
Q&I housing at the start of 
the semester and were thus 
prioritizing on-campus residents 
— a policy that, according to 
Fitzgerald, has been in place 
since last semester. 
“With the start of the term 
and 
many 
students 
moving 
back into the residence halls, 
and anticipated increased need 
for 
isolation 
for 
on-campus 
residents, Q&I space is being 
prioritized 
for 
on-campus 
residents and not available to 
off-campus 
students 
at 
this 
time,” Fitzgerald wrote. “That 
approach has not changed from 
the fall term.”
In a separate email to The 
Daily, 
Fitzgerald 
provided 
additional resources for students 
who test positive for COVID-
19, encouraging those who get 
tested off campus to report their 
results to the University.
“(Reporting positive tests) is 
the quickest, most effective way 
to get on the list for transfer to 
Q&I housing,” Fitzgerald said. 
“As our Student Life colleagues 
investigate 
some 
of 
these 
situations, they are finding that 
students are not uploading their 
test results.”
Students can report their 
positive COVID-19 test results 
here.
As of Jan. 7, Q&I housing 
occupancy is reported to be 
at 33.3% capacity. University 
spokesperson Kim Broekhuizen 
wrote in an email to The Daily 
that Q&I housing data is updated 
every morning at 8:30 a.m., and 
students who move into housing 
after the data is posted are not 
included until the next day. 
“It is not real time data,” 
Broekhuizen wrote. “As noted, 
Q&I 
is 
constantly 
moving 
students 
in, 
and 
out, 
each 
day. The numbers are always 
changing.”

U-M instructors ‘e-pivot’ to 
remote instruction for first 
two weeks of semester

With COVID-19 case counts at a record high, some faculty members decide to shift online

The Graduate Employees’ Organization 
and some faculty members at the University of 
Michigan are calling on the administration to 
pivot to remote learning, or “e-pivot,” for the 
first two weeks of the semester in an effort to 
curb the recent skyrocket in COVID-19 Omicron 
cases.
On 
Wednesday, 
GEO 
hosted 
a 
press 
conference via Zoom to announce they 
would take matters into their own hands, 
teaching remotely until cases return to a more 
manageable level
Rebekah Modrak, professor of Art & Design, 
said the combination of rising hospitalizations, 
no remote options for students who test positive 
for COVID-19 and Ann Arbor Public Schools 
going online for the week of Jan. 3 outweigh the 
harms of two weeks of virtual learning. 
“If we are willing to look at the present reality, 
not as we may ideally want it to be, but as it is, 
what we see is that instructors are reporting 
high-numbers of frantic emails from students 
notifying them of an infection, a need to isolate, 
or delays in their travel plans,” Modrak said.
Positive COVID-19 cases at the University are 
currently at their highest since February 2021. 
The U.S. also recently reported over one million 
new daily COVID-19 cases on Jan. 4. 
Lecturers’ Employee Organization president 
Kirsten Herold, who was also present at the 
press conference, said while the Fall 2021 

semester was successful, too much is unknown 
about the omicron variant of COVID-19 to 
mandate in-person instruction. 
“A lot of (LEO) members want to teach 
in-person,” Herold said. “We are calling on the 
administration to allow instructor discretion – 
at least for the first few weeks … . We find the 
distrust in faculty members to make the right 
choice really disheartening.” 
Prior to Wednesday’s press conference, GEO 
held an emergency general membership meeting 
Tuesday to discuss the University’s decision to 
have an in-person semester. After the meeting, 
GEO sent an email, which was obtained by The 
Daily, to their members, saying 95% of attendees 
voted to endorse a motion to support an e-pivot. 
GEO president Joey Valle said at the press 
conference that hybrid learning is inevitable due 
to high numbers of faculty members and students 
testing positive for COVID-19 and having to 
quarantine. Valle said the complications with 
resuming in-person learning outweigh the 
potential benefits. 
“The University has repeatedly made the 
claim that classrooms are safe and there’s no 
transmission in classrooms, however after 
repeated asking, they have not provided the 
evidence of that,” Valle said. “ The University’s 
stance that people need to be in person … despite 
many unknowns on how omicron is transmitted 
within our University’s campus represents a 
situation that is very concerning for many of our 
members.” 
The GEO conference comes after U-M faculty 
penned an open letter to the campus community 

Monday advocating for a short period of remote 
learning at the beginning of the term. The 
rapid spread of the omicron variant has led 
1,475 community members to ask for remote 
instruction, according to the letter. 
The letter highlights similar concerns from 
students, faculty and families as hospitals are 
overwhelmed with positive cases. The letter says 
while the University as an institution continues 
to push for in-person instruction, the e-pivot is 
something faculty and students are personally 
deciding to participate in on the individual level.
University 
spokesman 
Rick 
Fitzgerald 
told The Michigan Daily in an email that 
the signatories to the open letter represent a 
small percentage of faculty on the University’s 
campus and those who signed the letter aren’t 
necessarily instructors or planning on moving 
their classes remotely. According to Fitzgerald, 
the University has 5,200 instructors teaching 
classes to more than 50,000 students this term. 
“A classroom at U-M is, perhaps, the safest 
place to be in the entire state of Michigan,” 
Fitzgerald wrote. “As noted on our public 
dashboard, 98 percent of all students are 
vaccinated, 98 percent of faculty are fully 
vaccinated and there is an indoors (sic) masking 
requirement across the campus.”
In an interview with The Michigan Daily, 
GEO Secretary SN Yeager said they would like 
to see the University reassess their decision for 
in-person learning after the e-pivot time period 
is over.

‘I feel disrespected’: 
UMich students face 
long wait for quarantine 
& isolation housing

 ‘U’ experiences delays, prioritize on-campus 
residents in Q&I accommodations 

TAMARA TURNER/Daily

In July 2021, Rackham alumni 
Matthew Bernhard heard that the 
Georgia Institute of Technology was 
considering offering a job to then-
University of Michigan professor 
Daniel Genkin. 
Bernhard had repeatedly made 
UMich 
administrators 
aware 
of 
Genkin’s alleged academic bullying in 
the Computer Science and Engineering 
department. He decided it was worth 
making his concerns known one 
more time, this time via a Twitter 
direct message to an acquaintance 
and faculty member in Georgia Tech’s 
School of Cybersecurity and Privacy.
“Hey, so word on the street is 
that (Georgia Tech) is making an 
accelerated tenure offer to Daniel 
Genkin,” Bernhard wrote in messages 
obtained by The Michigan Daily. 
“That’s possibly a really bad idea. Daniel 
is horrifically abusive to students and 
other faculty, a fact pattern that has 
followed him from Penn to UMich.”
After receiving this message, the 

Georgia Tech faculty member sent a 
screenshot of it to the interim chair 
of the School of Cybersecurity and 
Privacy, Rich DeMillo, according to 
emails obtained by The Daily under a 
Freedom of Information Act request. 
The Georgia Tech faculty member 
introduced Bernhard to DeMillo via an 
email, obtained by The Daily, sent later 
that day. 
Within 
hours, 
Bernhard 
sent 
DeMillo a multi-paragraph description 
of Genkin’s alleged bullying at UMich. 
A portion of Bernhard’s email to 
DeMillo.
Bernhard 
never 
heard 
back. 
But DeMillo included Bernhard’s 
allegations in a document obtained 
by The Daily detailing the numerous 
warnings Georgia Tech had received 
about Genkin’s alleged behavior.
Document describing allegations 
obtained by The Daily under FOIA.

Two 
weeks 
later, 
DeMillo 
announced Genkin’s hiring to Georgia 
Tech’s School of Cybersecurity and 
Privacy.
A Michigan Daily investigation 
found 
numerous 
previously 

undisclosed allegations of abusive 
behavior 
against 
Genkin. 
These 
allegations span Genkin’s time at the 
University of Pennsylvania, where 
Genkin was previously employed as 
a postdoctoral researcher, and at the 
University of Michigan, where Genkin 
was a faculty member in the Computer 
Science and Engineering department 
from 2018 to 2021. 
The allegations range from pressure 
to falsify data to comments and actions 
insinuating physical violence. They 
also include alleged misogynistic and 
racially charged comments, emotional 
manipulation 
and 
unprofessional 
workplace behavior.
The Daily’s investigation also 
found that administrators at UPenn, 
UMich and Georgia Tech were 
repeatedly made aware of these 
allegations, according to dozens of 
emails, messages and other documents 
obtained by The Daily.
The 
Daily 
also 
found 
that 
complaints against Genkin were 
reported to UMich’s then-Office for 
Institutional Equity (now the Office for 
Equity, Civil Rights & Title IX). At least 
one of these complaints prompted an 

investigation into Genkin’s behavior. 
The status of this investigation remains 
unclear.
In an email to The Daily, Genkin 
disputed these allegations.
“These 
[allegations] 
were 
investigated by Michigan’s CSE and 
found to be inaccurate or exaggerated,” 
Genkin wrote. “As a result, no 
disciplinary actions were taken. I was 
never contacted by OIE and have a 
clean disciplinary record across Penn, 
Michigan and Georgia Tech.”
Genkin’s statement to The Daily.
Blair 
Meeks, 
Georgia 
Tech’s 
Assistant Vice President of External 
Communications, 
wrote 
in 
an 
emailed statement to The Daily that 
“all of (Georgia Tech’s) typical hiring 
procedures 
including 
background 
checks, criminal record checks and 
reference input” were followed when 
hiring Genkin. 
DeMillo 
declined 
numerous 
interview requests, writing in an email 
to The Daily, “I am unclear what story 
you are asking me to share my side of.”
“Some of your questions refer to past 
events at Michigan about which I have 
no first-hand knowledge,” DeMillo 

wrote in a later email to The Daily. 
“Other questions appear to be based on 
allegations that are flatly untrue.”
DeMillo declined to comment 
on specific allegations and didn’t 
note which ones he believes are 
untrue.
Michael Wellman, the current 
Chair of UMich’s Computer Science 
and Engineering department, said 
in an interview with The Daily that 
the department effectively addressed 
complaints against Genkin. 
“In this case, the actions … we 
implemented to address concerns 
about faculty behavior were effective,” 
Wellman said. “We investigated 
immediately, 
we 
supported 
the 
students, we set clear expectations 
for the faculty member for correction 
and improvement. We took decisive 
action, CSE did, in this case as soon as 
relevant information was brought to 
our attention.”
This is not the first allegation of 
improper workplace conduct to be 
raised against professors in UMich’s 
CSE department. In February 2020, 
The Verge reported allegations of 
sexual harrassment against CSE 

professor Jason Mars. In May 2021, 
The Daily published an investigation 
regarding 
UMich’s 
handling 
of 
allegations of sexual misconduct 
against former CSE professor Walter 
Lasecki. 
The CSE department has also 
experienced 
rapid 
turnover 
in 
leadership. Chair Brian Noble stepped 
down in February 2020, weeks after 
allegations were reported against 
Mars. Later that year, Interim Chair 
Peter Chen abruptly stepped down in 
July 2020 for “personal reasons.” In 
January 2021, Chen was charged with 
criminal sexual misconduct, and that 
case is currently pending trial. 
Wellman told The Daily that CSE 
is more committed to improving the 
department’s culture than ever before. 
“CSE is, based on our experience, 
arguably more aware than just about 
any other departments about the 
necessity to ensure and to establish 
a strong community with a positive 
climate,” Wellman said. “And our 
faculty and staff are working on many 
fronts to achieve this.”

State of Michigan adopts new 
Congressional maps, reflects 
on engagement process

Jim Toy, a lifelong advocate of 
LGBTQ+ rights who was widely 
believed to be the first openly 
gay man in the state of Michigan, 
peacefully passed away on January 
1 at the age of 91, according to The 
Detroit Free Press.
As early as the 1970s, Toy was 
a prominent voice in fighting dis-
crimination against the LGBTQ+ 
community. He graduated from the 
University of Michigan with a mas-
ter’s degree in clinical social work 
and helped to establish the Uni-
versity’s Human Sexuality Office 
— now referred to as the Spectrum 
Center — which became the “first 
campus center in history” commit-
ted to supporting LGBTQ+ indi-
viduals.
“I’m saddened to hear of the 
death of Jim Toy, national social 
justice advocate, life-long cham-
pion of LGBTQ+ rights, pioneer of 
the @UMSpectrumCtr & 2021 @
UMich honorary degree recipient,” 
University President Mark Schlis-
sel wrote on social media. “May we 
all honor his legacy by offering our 

support to all who experience dis-
crimination.”
At a 1970 anti-Vietnam War rally 
in Kennedy Square, Detroit, Toy 
became the first man in the state 
to publicly come out as gay while 
representing the Detroit Gay Lib-
eration Front. He later went on to 
become a founding member of the 
Ann Arbor Gay Liberation Front.
Many local officials, including 
Washtenaw County Commissioner 
Jason Morgan, also spoke to Toy’s 
legacy and impact on the commu-
nity on social media.
“Jim Toy was and will always 
be a champion for LGBTQ rights 
and for our community,” Morgan 
wrote in a Tweet. “He was a men-
tor, friend and someone I admired. 
I am honored to have known Jim.”
Ann 
Arbor 
City 
Council-
member Travis Radina, D-Ward 
3, served alongside Toy at the 
Washtenaw Rainbow Action Proj-
ect, which was renamed the Jim 
Toy Community Center in 2010. 
Radina shared on Facebook that 
Toy was a thoughtful and wise 
mentor, who went on to co-author 
the first official Pride Week decla-
ration adopted by the Ann Arbor 
City Council. 

“Most people who are lucky to 
live as long as Jim did have expe-
rienced amazing and great lives,” 
Radina wrote. “But Jim wasn’t 
satisfied to simply live a great life 
for himself. He dedicated nearly 
all of his time with us to ensuring 
that others could live great lives 
as well — and to live them openly, 
safely and as our true selves, sur-
rounded by friends and unwaver-
ing love.”
Radina also noted Toy was a co-
author on Ann Arbor’s first non-

discrimmination policy on sexual 
orientation as well as a strong pro-
ponent of adding sexual orienta-
tion, gender identity and gender 
expression to the University’s non-
discrimmination bylaw. 
Flowers and memories can be 
sent through the Muehlig Funeral 
Chapel. No services have been 
scheduled.

Ann Arbor, Washtenaw County officials reflect on legacy and impact

BECCA MAHON/Daily

Leaders of the Michigan Independent Citizens 
Redistricting Committee (MICRC) held a news con-
ference Tuesday to speak on the officially adopted 
congressional maps for the state of Michigan.
Following years of engaging in community 
feedback, the commission adopted the Chestnut 
Congressional map, Linden state Senate map and 
Hickory state House map. The approved maps will 
be in place until the next redistricting cycle in 2031.
The Chestnut map — which removes the state’s 
two majority-Black congressional districts — was 
backed by eight commissioners and gives Democrats 
a 7-6 advantage in the next election. The Linden map 
was backed by nine commissioners and leans 21-17 
Democrat, a move that shifts the control away from 
Republicans in the state Senate for the first time 
since the early 1980s. The Hickory map was backed 
by 11 commissioners and leans 54-56 Republican.
Throughout the drawing and consideration of 
various maps, the commission said they heard sev-
eral concerns from citizens about gerrymandering 
and ensuring accurate representation for Michigan 
voters. The commission — led by 13 citizens random-
ly selected from more than 9,000 applications — had 
more than 25,000 comments from across the state 
over the course of 130 open meetings.
The MICRC’s work is the first time in state his-
tory that an independent citizen-led commission 
handled the redistricting process. In 2018, Michigan 
voters approved an amendment to the state consti-
tution that created the commission, requiring their 
work be done open to the public. 
MICRC Chairperson Rebecca Szetela said that 
the most exciting aspect of this redistricting process 
was the citizen participation.
“This has been an exciting and invigorating pro-
cess and I am so proud to have been a part of it,” 
Szetela said. “This is the first time that we have had 
citizens throughout the state have the ability to com-
ment, participate and assist in the drafting of con-
gressional districts, state House districts and state 
Senate districts, and that is a fantastic testament to 
Michigan and a fantastic testament to this commis-
sion that we were able to do it.”
Commissioner Brittni Kellom agreed, saying that 
she appreciated the ways in which the commission 
was able to work together.
“We live in a society where voting and trust and 
being a caring brother or sister to your fellow 
citizen isn’t always the value and I think we had an 
opportunity to reinstill that in Michigan,” Kellom 
said. “I think that that above all is a testament to what 
true democracy looks like. It’s a testament to what it 
looks like to work together and build community no 
matter what your race is, no matter what you believe 
in, no matter what you do in your personal life, so 
that has been the beauty of the commission.”
During the press conference, the commission said 
they received significant feedback from citizens who 
were concerned with the lack of representation for 
Black residents in the state, particularly in the city of 
Detroit.
Kellom said that if the commissioners had more 
time to draw out the maps and get to know areas 
across the state, especially Detroit, the final maps 
likely would have been different and more consider-
ate of the Black population in Michigan.
“I know Black people all over, and particularly in 
Detroit, will continue to do what they need to do to 
survive, which is to galvanize and to be active and 
to do what they need to do,” Kellom said. “Do I wish 

that there was more time to get it right? Absolutely, 
because I truly believe that the way that you answer 
and restore pain and healing is to give people a head 
start and a head start is not cheating when you’ve 
gone so long without.”
Szetela said that while she believes the approved 
maps are in agreement with the Voting Rights Act, 
she said she is still concerned that a lack of data about 
Black voters, especially in and around Detroit, may 
have impacted the fairness of the final maps.
“Unfortunately with this process being so data 
driven, there’s just an absence of data that we can’t 
analyze to determine that,” Szetela said.
Szetela, Kellom and Commissioners Rhonda 
Lange and Erin Wagner all voted against a motion 
Tuesday morning that would have stopped the com-
mission from considering new maps. If approved, 
however, this motion would have extended public 
comment by enacting a new 45-day period, which 
would have given the commission more time to con-
sider other maps or draw new maps.
Szelta said that an extension of time may have 
allowed for more fair maps to be drawn that would 
more accurately represent voters.
“I think the biggest issue for us was just time,” 
Szetela said. “Unfortunately, we happen to have 
this inaugural commission come into play during a 
pandemic which created all sorts of challenges both 
with the ability for us to meet in person and with the 
ability to get data from the Census Bureau that assist-
ed us in drawing the maps so despite that extraordi-
nary challenge, we rose to the occasion, we worked 
really hard and we managed to get these maps done 
in a timely manner.”
Moving forward, Kellom advised all citizens to 
examine the maps and continue to actively partici-
pate in voting and democracy.
“I would tell the citizens to understand the map 
– whatever feeling you have on it – understand all 
three maps and what that means for you in the 
future, and then develop and devise and create and 
reimagine, just like we did, a plan that allows you to 
be the most successful and what that means and I 
hope as a commission, we can have opportunities to 
facilitate that conversation,” Kellom said.
Despite conflicts in support for the approved maps, 
Communications and Outreach Director Edward 
Woods III said that having a citizen-run commission 
allowed for more fair maps to be produced.
“In 2018, voters in Michigan, by more than 61%, 
said that they wanted voters, citizens, Michigan resi-
dents to draw the maps and not politicians so that 
they can have fair maps and prevent gerrymander-
ing,” Woods said. “Tonight, we are happy to report 
that that has taken place.”
Commissioner Douglas J. Clark said that he 
is proud of these maps and that the commission 
worked hard to represent all communities as best 
they could.
“We just can’t meet everybody’s needs 100%, so 
we chose to move forward and do the best we could 
to get to that point and we recognize there’s probably 
some things that some folks like and other things 
they don’t,” Clark said. “There’s conflicts in every-
thing that we went forward to discuss. We made it 
where we thought it represented the largest part 
of the society and I’m personally very proud of the 
products that we’ve produced.”
The commissioners said that they do not plan to 
sue the commission moving forward, but they may 
still face legal challenges.

On Friday, the University of Michigan COVID-
19 dashboard reported a record high of 815 positive 
cases so far for the week of Jan. 2. This number has 
increased since the University reported 676 positive 
cases for the previous week ending on Jan. 1.
Most cases are linked to household and social 
gathering exposures, according to the dashboard 
update, and the majority of cases reported mild 
symptoms of sore throat and runny nose. The 
positive COVID-19 cases were collected from the 
Community Sampling and Tracking Program and 
the University Health Services, the latter of which 
reached a 26.9% positivity rate on Friday. Complete 
data for this week will be released on the COVID-19 
dashboard on Jan. 12.
Quarantine and isolation housing was at 35.1% 
capacity on Thursday before dropping to 33.3% as of 
Friday at 8:30 a.m.
The University has received 22,000 submissions 
of booster information from students, faculty and 
staff from all three U-M campuses, University Presi-
dent Mark Schlissel wrote in an email to the campus 
community Friday. Submissions are currently being 
verified, and individuals may submit vaccine infor-
mation here.
Schlissel also announced that N95 masks will 
be available while supplies last at some on-campus 
COVID-19 testing locations. The masks will be avail-
able for anyone in the U-M community and can be 
found at any of the seven CSTP sites on campus in 
the coming days. Individuals do not need to be get-
ting a COVID-19 test to receive an N95 mask. 
In addition, Schlissel called on U-M instructors 
to offer flexibility in accommodating students who 
are ill or quarantining this semester, including not 
penalizing students who may not have documenta-
tion of illness.
“In addition, accommodation for illness can 
include activating video or zoom in equipped class-
rooms so that students who are out sick can see and 
hear the class…” Schlissel wrote. “Provost Susan 
M. Collins and I also recognize that in some cases, 
absences of instructors or large numbers of students 
due to illness and quarantine and isolation may tem-
porarily warrant remote teaching.”
Martino Harmon, vice president for student life, 
and Robert D. Ernst, associate vice president of stu-
dent life for health and wellness, sent an email out to 
students on Thursday detailing information on what 
to do if students test positive.

At the Dec. 9 Board of Regents 
Meeting at the Postma Club-
house, Chuck Christian, a for-
mer University of Michigan 
football player and a survivor of 
former University doctor Robert 
Anderson, made an unsched-
uled 
appearance. 
Christian 
spoke with the regents about his 
experience with Anderson and 
his resulting fear of doctors – to 
which he attributes his stage IV 
cancer diagnosis. 
Christian – who has been 
camping 
outside 
University 
President Mark Schlissel’s house 
since Oct. 8 along with fellow 
Anderson 
survivor 
Jonathan 
Vaughn – said he knows many 
other survivors who have been 
diagnosed with preventable dis-
eases because of their fear of 
doctors. 
“We’re still dealing with the 
trauma 30, 40 and 50 years later; 

some of us can’t hold a job because 
Michigan didn’t stop Anderson,” 
Christian said. “One player said 
to me, ‘I have battled with drugs 
and alcohol for half of my life, all 
because I was raped repeatedly 
by the team doctor.’ Four of my 
friends have died in the last year 
because of their fear of doctors.” 
Christian then revealed Jona-
than Vaughn has recently been 
diagnosed with cancer. 
“I just found out today that my 
dear friend Jon Vaughn was diag-
nosed with cancer,” Christian 
said at the Dec. 9 meeting. “My 
prayer is that it’s not the terminal 
kind like I have, and Jon will con-
tinue to protest in the camper in 
front of the President’s house…in 
public you say how sorry you are 
about what Anderson did, but in 
private victims are traumatized 
and abused. We are treated like 
animals.” 
Vaughn – who announced on 
Nov. 14 he is running for Board 
of Regent in 2022 and has vowed 
to camp outside of Schlissel’s 
house for 100 days or until Presi-
dent Schlissel and the Board of 
Regents agree to meet with him 
– sat down with The Michigan 

Daily to talk about his diagnosis 
and what it means for both his 
regent campaign and the ongoing 
protest. 
Vaughn said he first began to 
experience symptoms on Oct. 
5 – three days before he began 
camping outside Schlissel’s house 
– when he noticed a lump on his 
neck. Vaughn said he later went 
to the doctor’s, where he was ulti-
mately diagnosed with thyroid 
cancer. 
Vaughn said it was terrifying 
to be back in a hospital after his 
experience with Anderson, but 
Christian helped him put those 

fears aside and take care of his 
health. 
“That first weekend when I 
found out I’m having conversa-
tions with Chuck and he was like, 
‘you know, Jon, just don’t put this 
off like I did,’” Vaughn said. “That 
was when it kind of hit me … that I 
had compartmentalized so much 
– it was terrifying, obviously, to 
walk into a hospital for first time 
in many, many, many years, but 
once I got there, I realized that at 
some point in time, (I was) gonna 
have to break the cycle.” 
Vaughn said he will undergo 
surgery in January to remove 

the cancer and Christian and 
Tad Deluca – former University 
wrestler and whistleblower for 
the Anderson case – will take over 
protesting while he is in surgery 
and recovering. 
“I will go in (to surgery) in the 
morning, they have to observe 
me overnight and then I (will be) 
released the next day,” Vaughn 
said. “I’ve already started talking 
to Chuck and Tad and some of the 
other survivors that, at that point, 
we’ll do a relay which I will hand 
off for one of my fellow survivors 
to sleep in the tent or the camper 
overnight, and then I’ll be right 

back (after my recovery).” 
Vaughn said his diagnosis will 
not impact his regent campaign 
and he is working on creating a 
more concrete campaign blue-
print to share with voters in the 
coming months. 
Over 950 Anderson survivors 
have been in ongoing mediation 
with the University since Oct. 
2020. Vaughn and Christian plan 
to continue camping outside of 
Schlissel’s house until Jan. 16.

ALLISON ENGKVIST/Daily

Now that the gradu-
ating class of Michigan 
Daily journalists, editors 
and developers have said 
their heartfelt goodbyes, 
it’s time for a chorus of 
enthusiastic 
“hellos.” 
After a staff-wide elec-
tion on Nov. 12 and sev-
eral 
section-specific 
elections throughout the 
past couple of months, 
The Michigan Daily is 
delighted to announce its 
131st editor in chief and 
managing editor team.
The editor in chief and 
the editorial page edi-
tors were elected by all 
sections of The Daily on 
Nov. 12. The managing 
editor and digital manag-
ing editor were appointed 
by the editor in chief and 
approved by The Daily’s 
management desk on Nov. 
28. The management desk 
also chose a new editor 
of The Statement, the 

paper’s weekly magazine. 
Editor in Chief: Jas-
min Lee
LSA junior Jasmin Lee 
will serve as The Daily’s 
editor in chief for the 2022 
calendar year. Lee previ-
ously served as a senior 
news 
editor 
overseeing 
campus life and student 
government coverage, as 
well as a member of Cul-
ture, Training and Inclu-
sion. Lee said she has 
wanted to run for EIC 
since she began writing as 
a freshman and one of her 
main goals is to make The 
Daily more accessible to 
students on campus. 
“In the past, The Daily, 
(has seemed) like this big 
intimidating (place),” Lee 
said. “Although the work 
we do is important, and 
does take a lot of time, I 
just want to make sure 
either the ability to pro-
duce work on The Daily, or 
the ability to have access 
to the quality journalism 
that we produce, is open to 
everyone.” 

Managing 
Editor: 
Paige Hodder 
LSA junior Paige Hod-
der will serve as the paper-
wide managing editor for 
2022 and will work with 
Lee to create a commu-
nity among Daily staffers. 
Hodder previously served 
as a summer news editor, 
a Daily staff reporter and 
contributor for The Daily 
Weekly Podcast. 
“One 
of 
my 
biggest 
goals is to recapture and 
redefine the kind of com-
munity that we create at 
The Daily,” Hodder said. 
“A lot of that has been lost 
to COVID it can feel really 
disconnected these days 
and I want to bring us back 
together as a newsroom, 
but then also cultivate a 
culture in the newsroom 
of listening and acknowl-
edgement 
of 
shared 
knowledge.” 
Digital Managing Edi-
tor: Aya Salim
As The Daily’s second 
ever digital managing edi-
tor, LSA junior Aya Salim 
will be responsible for 

overseeing 
The 
Daily’s 
online presence and the 
six digital sections: photo, 
video, web, design, audi-
ence engagement and pod-
cast. 
Before being appointed 
to her new position by 
Lee, Salim served as the 
managing design editor 
and worked on the video 
section as a videographer 
as well. After working in 
two different digital sec-
tions throughout her three 
semesters on staff, Salim 
said she plans to facilitate 
cross-section projects and 
support The Daily’s ongo-
ing “online-first” initia-
tive.
“I’m really excited to 
see not only how print and 
digital sections can collab-
orate … but also just how 
the digital sections them-
selves can collaborate and 
do cool different projects,” 
Salim said. “And also how 
the digital aspects of The 
Daily can also contribute 
to accessibility.” 

Business 
Manager: 
Aaron Santilli
LSA sophomore Aaron 
Santilli, 
former 
senior 
account 
executive, 
will 
lead The Daily’s business 
operation section for 2022. 
Santilli said one of his 
main goals as business 
manager is to make sure 
staffers were compensat-
ed equitably for the work 
they produced. 
“(My goal is) ensur-
ing that all employees of 
The Daily are paid (and) 
treated fairly for the work 
that 
they’re 
producing. 
So you know, I’m going to 
continue that in cohesion 
with Jasmin, the editor in 
chief, as well as Paige the 
(managing) editor,” San-
tilli said. 
Arts: Sabriya Imami 
and Lillian Pearce
The arts section will 
be led by LSA juniors 
Sabriya Imami and Lillian 
Pearce, the 2022 manag-
ing arts editors. Both of 
them have previous expe-
rience as arts writer and 
Imami served as the film 

beat editor while Pearce 
served as the book beat 
editor. A major part of 
their platform is to consis-
tently put their writers at 
the forefront. To help arts 
writers make the most of 
their time on staff, Pearce 
said she and Imami plan to 
host workshops on lever-
aging Daily experiences in 
the job market.
“As managing editors, 
Sabriya and I are planning 
out different workshops 
we could do to help (arts 
staffers) 
improve 
their 
internship 
opportunities 
or their interview skills,” 
Pearce said. “So we are 
really 
excited 
thinking 
about how we can support 
writers and Daily arts peo-
ple in different (aspects) of 
their lives.”
Imami said she and 
Pearce also want to pro-
duce more content fea-
turing the local art scene 
to encourage the greater 
Washtenaw County com-
munity to read and con-
tribute to arts articles.
“There’s a huge music 
scene in Ann Arbor that 
we wanted to highlight 
and even all the local 
bookstores and booksell-
ers, just to uplift the Ann 
Arbor community too,” 
Imami said.
Audience 
Engage-
ment: Evan DeLorenzo 
and Zoe Storer 
LSA junior Evan DeLo-
renzo and LSA sophomore 
Zoe Storer will serve as 
the 2022 audience engage-
ment managing editors. 
DeLorenzo has served as 
a senior editor for audi-
ence engagement and an 
academics reporter for 
the news section. Storer 
worked as an audience 
engagement assistant edi-
tor as well as the audience 
engagement co-managing 
editor for summer 2021. 
DeLorenzo 
said 
the 
audience 
engagement 
section is responsible for 
keeping 
the 
University 
of Michigan community 
informed on The Daily’s 
content. 
“I just really love the 
thrill of breaking news 
and feeling a part of some 
online 
community. 
It 
brings a sense of impor-
tance and purpose to my 

life,” DeLorenzo said. “It’s 
more than just like tweet-
ing captions and whatnot, 
we’re bringing good con-
tent to the people.” 
Storer said one of her 
main goals as co-man-
aging editor is to build 
cohesion within the audi-
ence engagement section 
because editors and staff-
ers often have different 
experiences and responsi-
bilities. 
“People who work on 
(our) newsletter have a 
very different experience 
than people who work on 
our Instagram or Face-
book and Twitter,” Storer 
said. “So kind of (just) 
bringing all those groups 
together and then…con-
tinuing to create a plat-
form where people in the 
campus community can 
find the most important 
news and book reviews 
and all that good stuff.” 
Copy: Caroline Atkin-
son and Ethan Patrick
LSA juniors Caroline 
Atkinson and Ethan Pat-
rick will be taking over 
as the 2022 copy chiefs. 
Both Atkinson and Patrick 
have previously served as 
senior copy editors and 
summer 2021 copy chiefs. 
Atkinson has also written 
for the arts section while 
Patrick has written Daily 
sports 
pieces. 
Patrick 
said their main goal is to 
restructure the copy sec-
tion to give the senior copy 
editors greater responsi-
bility and flexibility.
“We 
are 
restructur-
ing copy a little bit to try 
to make it less suscep-
tible to burnout,” Patrick 
said. “One of our goals 
is to increase the power 
and responsibility of the 
senior copy editors … so 
we hope it’s more exciting 
for them because it’s a lit-
tle more responsibility on 
their part, but it’s also just 
going to be easier for their 
schedule.”
Atkinson 
said 
the 
planned restructure will 
also allow her and Patrick 
to spend more time look-
ing holistically at each 
article to ensure all pub-

“I would hope that they would realize that they have not 
been transparent,” Yeager said. “They have not considered 
anyone they say that they’re considering in these plans and 
… I would like to see (the University) reassess their insistence 
that everyone be in person because saying everything’s in 
person when we’re all (individually) switching to remote is 
just ridiculous.”
At the start of the Fall 2020 semester, GEO went on strike 
for two weeks in response to the University’s reopening 
plans amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Yeager later told The 
Daily in an email that the organization’s members do not 
plan to go on strike right now and would rather continue 
teaching, but in a safer manner.
“Graduate students come to this university in part 
because we want to teach, which is what we’re currently 
doing right now, even if we’re doing so virtually,” Yaeger 

wrote. “So GEO’s current focus is not a job action, but 
supporting graduate students who are teaching, no matter 
what modality they choose.”
Yeager said in order for GEO to go on strike, a majority of 
members currently employed by the University as Graduate 
Student Instructors or Graduate Student Staff Assistants 
would need to vote to do so. 
LSA junior Annie Mintun, speaker of the Central Student 
Government assembly, said at the press conference that 
she sees the e-pivot as an opportunity for students to have 
access to learning during an uncertain semester. Mintun, 
who is currently quarantining due to a COVID-19 exposure, 
said the e-pivot would be one of the only ways she could 
participate in her classes. 
“The only confidence I had that I would actually be able 
to actually participate this (week) was when I heard that 
instructors were coming together to provide online options 
for students like me who are in quarantine,” Mintun said. “I 
hope that the University will not punish these instructors 
who are taking it upon themselves to try and protect their 

students.” 
Valle said while there have been no documented cases of 
retaliation against faculty members who decided to e-pivot, 
there have been emails from faculty discouraging remote 
instruction. Valle also said if COVID-19 conditions continue 
to deteriorate, there is potential for the e-pivot to extend 
beyond two weeks. 
“The decision to make this a two week e-pivot was made 
democratically, rising out of faculty concern,” Valle said. “If 
we are in largely a similar situation two weeks from now, 
I imagine similar democratic processes might extend the 
e-pivot.” 
University President Mark Schlissel and University 
Provost Susan Collins also sent an email to the U-M 
community Monday — two days before the start of the 
semester — reiterating the University’s commitment to an 
in-person start on Jan. 5 and reminding students to continue 
masking indoors and self-report the mandated COVID-19 
booster shots. 
“We expect these first few weeks of the semester to be 

challenging and ask everyone to care for yourselves and for 
one another by staying safe and practicing kindness during 
what will be a stressful time for many,” Schlissel and Collins 
wrote. “Cases are very likely to increase, regardless of 
decisions we make about in-person work or classes.”
In reference to Schlissel and Collins’ email, Silke-Maria 
Weineck, professor of comparative literature and German 
studies, told The Daily that the two narratives of taking care 
of each other while also teaching in person do not seem to 
coincide, and many faculty members will choose to prioritize 
their health and safety over in-person classes.
“We got an email from Schlissel (on Wednesday) that 
said, ‘please be kind to each other, support each other, do 
what’s good for you, but also teach in person,” Weineck 
said. “It seems these two directives are incompatible. And I 
think many of us will choose to take the second part of the

Wellman also expressed his commitment 
to the faculty mentorship process. 
“But it’s also important to realize we do 
not discard people the first time they make 
mistakes, but rather we attempt to correct the 
problems,” Wellman continued. “In this case, 
the system we put in place to mentor a new 
faculty member to address identified concerns 
worked.”
In an email on June 24, 2021, a Georgia 
Tech faculty member stressed the importance 
of getting Genkin to sign Georgia Tech’s offer 
letter for a tenure-track faculty position.
“Michigan is also trying to make things 
better for him and we should not give them 
unlimited time to work on him to stay,” the 
faculty member wrote to DeMillo. 
On August 9, 2021, Genkin wrote in an 
email to a Georgia Tech administrator that he 
was “being pushed to resign UM” and that he 
“had his lab packed up.” 
Genkin’s email in which he said that he was 
“being pushed to resign.”
Wellman said that he did not push Genkin 
to resign. 
“As I said, we made clear to him that he 
needed to correct the problematic behavior,” 
Wellman said. “We provided advice and 
mentoring about how to improve as a research 
advisor, including how to eliminate all the 
problematic behavior, how to reduce the stress 
that he was perceived as imposing on students. 
And we also introduced vigilant monitoring of 
his lab and paid attention to the well-being of 
students.”
Angel Rodriguez was an undergraduate 
researcher in a cybersecurity lab when 
Genkin joined UMich in 2018. According to 
Rodriguez, Genkin was intriguing: young and 
eccentric with a flashy research history. 
“He basically disrupted the whole security 
field,” Rodriguez said in an interview with 
The Daily. 
A few months after arriving at UMich, 
Genkin allegedly approached Rodriguez 
about working for him in exchange for a spot 
in the PhD program. 
“I knew that I had a harder chance of 
getting into the PhD program because I didn’t 
have the grades for it,” Rodriguez said. “He 
told me that he could basically guarantee that 
I’d get in.”
Rodriguez said he was enthusiastic about 
his “trial run” working for Genkin during the 
summer of 2019. But by the end of the summer, 
Rodriguez had reported Genkin to OIE twice. 
Genkin’s alleged bullying began with 
inappropriate comments. Rodriguez said he 
witnessed Genkin insult the speaking skills 
of non-native English speakers. Genkin 
allegedly called Rodriguez, an African 
American man, a “monkey” and allegedly 
made frequent comments about his weight. 
Once, Rodriguez said he watched Genkin 
keep a student feeling ill in the lab until 
the student started crying. In an interview 
with The Daily, Rodriguez said he filed his 
complaint with OIE because of this alleged 
incident. 
“I think that was the straw that really 
pushed me to report,” Rodriguez said to The 
Daily. “ (The student) really was afraid of 
leaving early because if (Genkin) saw … he 

would go into the office and then criticize 
(them) and belittle (them).”
On July 20, 2019, Rodriguez sent an 
anonymous email to OIE, a copy of which 
was obtained by The Daily. He asked about 
protections of students who report about the 
behavior of professors. 
“I have witnessed concerning actions from 
a faculty members that have made myself and 
others uncomfortable,” Rodriguez wrote. 
“Myself and others have refrained from 
reporting them because of the risks imposed 
on the students and faculty working directly 
or indirectly under them.”
Rodriguez’s anonymous email to then-OIE.
Elizabeth Seney, then-Senior Associate 
Director of then-OIE & Interim Title IX 
Coordinator, wrote back that the University’s 
policy “prohibits retaliation against an 
individual for reporting or otherwise sharing 
information about concerns of discrimination, 
including discriminatory harassment, on 
the basis of any protected class identified in 
the University’s Nondiscrimination Policy 
Notice.” 
Seney’s reply to Rodriguez’s anonymous 
email.
Nine days after that, Rodriguez responded 
with a detailed anonymous complaint about 
Genkin’s alleged behavior. 
“Daniel will frequently insult, belittle, and 
generally not be conscious of the negative 
effects his words and actions have on the 
feelings of wellbeing, safety, and respect, of 
his peers and underlings,” Rodriguez wrote to 
Seney. “I respect his work, but I do not respect 
the hostile work environment he has created.”
Seney replied, thanking him and writing 
that OIE would address the concerns which 
fall within OIE’s scope. 
Filing the anonymous complaint did 
not seem to improve Rodriguez’s working 
conditions, Rodriguez said. Genkin persisted 
in making “unreasonable” demands on 
Rodriguez’s work hours and research output, 
Rodriguez told The Daily. On August 12, 2019, 
Genkin questioned the 80 hours Rodriguez 
reported working over a two-week period in a 
message on Slack reviewed by The Daily. 

Later that week, Rodriguez said he went 
to Genkin’s office to ask him to approve his 
timecard. Rodriguez said that Genkin showed 
him what he claimed to be an unapproved 
lock on his door. Rodriguez said he cautioned 
Genkin against doing things he shouldn’t be. 
“If you tell anyone about it, I’ll get in trouble, 
and I’ll hang you,” Genkin allegedly replied, 
according to the second OIE complaint 
Rodriguez later filed.
“I look back on it now and I still feel like I 
under-reacted to a lot because of how much I 
had on my plate at the time,” Rodriguez told 
The Daily.
On Nov. 4, 2019, Rodriguez sent a message 
to graduate students about a new concern: 
Genkin was allegedly encouraging colleagues 
to falsify data before a fast-approaching 
academic paper deadline. Copies of this chat 
were obtained by The Daily.
With Rodriguez’s approval, Bernhard 
wrote to Noble about this pressure to falsify 
data. Three other graduate students, four 
faculty members and one administrator were 
cc’d on this email, obtained by The Daily. 
Rodriguez responded in the email chain 
that Genkin often pressured others to bend 

the rules. He wrote of the “numerous times” 
Genkin pressured him and his colleagues to 
circumvent “the safety committee … to cut 
costs and save time.” 
On Dec. 10, 2019, Rodriguez replied to the 
previously anonymous complaint to Seney 
by claiming it as his own. He included new 
allegations against Genkin in his reply. 
Rodriguez’s email to Seney in which 
he identified himself as the author of the 
anonymous OIE complaint.
“I kept feeling a deep fear that I was 
burning bridges I may need during or after 
my undergraduate career,” Rodriguez wrote 
in his email to Seney. “The news of this report 
reached Daniel, and I strongly believe he 
knows it was me. I fear for retaliation.”
Five days later, on Dec. 15, Rodriguez 
decided not to apply to the PhD program. 
Five days after that, on Dec. 20, Genkin 
submitted an application to a tenure-track 
faculty position in Georgia Tech’s School of 
Cybersecurity and Privacy. 
By April 2019, Bernhard was becoming 
wary of Genkin’s alleged behavior in the 
student office space he shared with Genkin’s 
advisees. He met with then-CSE chair Brian 
Noble to discuss this on April 19, 2019.
“The first meeting, I felt good,” Bernhard 
said in an interview with The Daily. “I sort of 
laid out…my concerns about the department 
were not just Daniel-based. It felt good to have 
someone who seemed at the time like they 
were listening.”
After that meeting, Genkin allegedly 
followed Bernhard out to his car to find out 
what information had been shared with Noble. 
“I couldn’t tell at the time if it was just total 
lack of awareness of social norms or … like, ‘I’m 
going to physically intimidate you and follow 
you around until you tell me what you’ve been 
telling other people’,” Bernhard said. 
Bernhard later initiated email chains, 
obtained by The Daily, with multiple graduate 
students and faculty members to discuss 
concerns about Genkin in Sep. 2019. 
One of Bernhard’s emails regarding his 
concerns about Genkin’s alleged behavior.
Genkin’s 
alleged 
conduct 
severely 
disrupted the graduate student workplace, 
according to Bernhard’s email chains. In 
one instance, he allegedly used the shared 
graduate student office to drill into his Segway 
battery, filling the space with noxious fumes, 
Bernhard wrote in the emails. 
In another instance, Bernhard wrote in 
the emails that he witnessed Genkin yell at 
a graduate student until they cried. When 
Bernhard spoke with Genkin about this, 
Genkin allegedly replied that, “I can either go 
in there and scream at (the student) until (they 
cry) and then (they’ll) do the thing, or I can just 
do it myself.” (Italics in original text)
In the same conversation, Bernhard wrote 
in the emails that Genkin allegedly said, “The 
only thing that gets professors fired is sexual 
impropriety and academic dishonesty.”
In early Sept. 2019, Bernhard heard rumors 
of Rodriguez’s OIE complaint.
“He’s been asking people if they want to go 
hunting for rats, apparently,” Bernhard wrote 
in a message to a peer obtained by The Daily. 
Over the next four months, Bernhard 
repeatedly met with Noble and other CSE 
faculty. Bernhard said that they consistently 
declined to take substantive action to address 
student concerns.

In one specific instance, Noble responded 
to Bernhard’s email to ask if any of Genkin’s 
behavior could be proven with something in 
writing.
Noble’s response asking if anything was in 
writing.
“The most common response from (Noble) 
was that his hands were tied,” Bernhard told 
The Daily. “Legally, (he) couldn’t do anything. 
There was nothing he could do to stop 
(Genkin) from abusing us. It’s just the system. 
It’s not really his fault, which was the one that 
really got to me.”
Bernhard recalled to The Daily that Noble 
established rules in one of these meetings that 
Genkin would have to follow going forward. 
One of these rules was that Genkin could not 
enter the shared graduate student office space.
After Genkin allegedly continued to enter 
the graduate student office space, Bernhard 
wrote to Noble. Noble responded via email to 
say that he had not yet spoken to Genkin. 
After months of meetings but little 
improvement in Genkin’s behavior, Bernhard 
told The Daily he and other graduate students 
had lost confidence in the department’s ability 
to address Genkin’s alleged bullying. 
“By this point, we were pretty upset that 
not only have we had to go through these 
fairly traumatizing experiences, but also 
that nothing was done,” Bernhard said. “The 
University as a whole didn’t seem to care.” 
Nevertheless, Rodriguez and Bernhard 
continued to make administrators aware 
of Genkin’s alleged conduct. In Feb. 2020, 
Rodriguez had individual meetings with 
Noble and Alec Gallimore, Dean of the College 
of Engineering. 
Rodriguez followed up with an email to 
Gallimore listing his recommendations to 
improve reporting to OIE. 
“Thank you for coming in and for this 
message,” Gallimore wrote in an email reply. 
“I’m also sorry. The behavior you describe has 
no place at Michigan.”
In March 2020, Bernhard forwarded then-
chair Peter Chen the previous emails between 
him, Noble, other faculty members and other 
graduate students regarding Genkin. Chen 
replied that he was “trying to get up to speed 
on this situation as fast as I can.”
In a video chat later that month, Bernhard 
said that Chen acknowledged he wasn’t sure if 
he could do anything to help the situation with 
Genkin. 
“He seemed receptive,” Bernhard said. “It 
was obvious he was in fact finding mode. I felt 
really good after my one conversation with 
(Chen). And then nothing happened as per 
usual.”
Even prior to his time at UMich, Genkin 
faced allegations of bullying.
In 2017, Genkin worked in UPenn’s 
Cryptography and Information Security 
department as a postdoctoral researcher. 
According to emails sent by a student in 
the department between Jan. 2017 and 
Sept. 2017 and obtained by The Daily, 
Genkin was allegedly “passive-aggressive,” 
“manipulative,” “disruptive,” “toxic” and an 
“intellectual bully.”
The 
UPenn 
Office 
of 
University 
Communications did not respond to repeated 
requests for comment by The Daily. Current 
CSE chair Wellman denied knowing about 
these allegations during Genkin’s hiring.
“I had heard about (the UPenn emails) 

recently that some students were saying that 
there were these known allegations, but we 
never received those and I can tell you as 
someone involved in the hiring, there was 
nothing in the record about that,” Wellman 
said in an interview with The Daily.
The term “academic bullying” has been 
increasingly applied to conduct in higher 
education institutions in recent years. 
Researchers say that bullying thrives in 
research settings. 
In 2019, the Max Planck Society in 
Germany conducted a survey of workplace 
harassment of over 9,000 employees, 17.5% of 
whom said they had experienced bullying in a 
period longer than 12 months. Also in 2019, the 
science journal Nature reported that roughly 
20% of the 6,000 PhD students surveyed said 
they experienced bullying. Of those, 57% said 
they felt “unable to discuss their situation 
without fear of personal repercussions.”
In an interview with The Daily, Wellman 
said that Genkin’s alleged behavior had 
changed.
“We did not receive any reports of incidents 
or problematic behavior of this sort after 2019,” 
Wellman said. 
Bernhard told The Daily he believes that 
the remote research requirements of the 
pandemic prevented Genkin from engaging in 
further alleged bullying.
“We were all remote so it’s not like (Genkin) 
could have done the things he was doing,” 
Bernhard said. “It’s hard to say, was it even 
really a problem anymore?”
Bernhard and Rodriguez both graduated 
from U-M CSE with their respective degrees 
in the spring 2020. 
Nov. 17, 2021, Rodriguez requested a copy 
of OIE’s investigative report regarding his 
complaints, according to details obtained by 
The Daily. Rodriguez was told via email that it 
would take up to 45 days for him to receive this 
report. He has not yet received a reply.
Though Bernhard contacted Georgia 
Tech administrators July 6, 2021, Genkin had 
received his first offer letter in May. Genkin 
signed a second offer letter on June 26. 

Wellman confirmed that he spoke with 
DeMillo, the Georgia Tech interim chair, on 
July 13, 2021, as indicated in emails obtained 
by The Daily. 
“So I had a phone call with the chair of 
the department that hired him, and I guess 
what I’ll say is that we did not withhold 
any information about his situation or his 
performance at Michigan,” Wellman said. “I 
answered any questions that he had.”
Georgia Tech completed a background 
check on Genkin on May 24, 2021. The 
background check, reviewed by The Daily, 
included a standard screening of any history 
of criminal, credit, driving or substance abuse. 
Records of Georgia Tech’s background 
check as obtained by The Daily.
In response to continued concerns over his 
previous alleged behavior, Genkin wrote to 
The Daily that his current students are happy 
with his mentorship style. 
“The allegations raised are in stark contrast 
to positive feedback from students that are 
currently in my research lab,” Genkin wrote.

LSA junior Kristina Wendling – who lives off-campus 
in a 10-person house – tested positive for COVID-19 on 
Tuesday, the day before classes resumed. Wendling has 
been quarantined in her room since she has been unable 
to utilize University-provided accommodations and is 
unable to return to her permanent residence, creating an 
uncomfortable living situation with her nine roommates. 
“Usually I’ll check everyone’s class schedules and see 
when the least amount of people are around and that’s 
when I’ll plan when I’m going to go make food or when I’m 
going to take a shower, things like that,” Wendling said. 
Wendling said her roommates all attend in-person 
classes and while none have tested positive for COVID-
19 yet, she’s concerned about putting her roommates and 
other students at risk. 
“I just wish I could have gotten better help with the 
isolation housing because I’m just in a weird little bedroom 
here and I still share common spaces,” Wendling said. “So 
I’m just nervous.”
LSA senior Bella Karduck lives in an off-campus 
residence where she shares a room and multiple common 
areas with other students. After first testing positive for 
COVID-19 in December 2021, Karduck stayed in Q&I 
housing. 
When Karduck tested positive with new symptoms 
on Jan. 3, she was denied University-provided 
accommodations and was told to reach out to the Dean 
of Students Office, which encouraged her to stay in her 

apartment. 
“The response I got from The Dean of Students Office 
was ‘Omicron is mild and highly-transmissible. So you can 
clean and try the best you can so your roommates don’t get 
sick,’” Karduck said. “So I posted in the Facebook pages 
looking for a place to stay kind of out of desperation so I 
didn’t have to drive home.”
Karduck said she wishes the University offered more 
options for off-campus students who test positive for 
COVID-19 and can’t relocate to their permanent residence 
or isolate in their off-campus residences.
Resident Advisors also discussed students living in 
residence halls who struggled to obtain access to Q&I 
housing after testing positive for COVID-19, according to 
messages obtained by The Daily.
“A resident of mine came to me telling me that their 
roommate tested positive and when UHS finally got back 
to them, they told her that they had around a 300 call 
backlog and that Q&I housing is at capacity,” one message 
read. 
Another message said Hall Directors had been directed 
to inform Resident Advisors to refrain from speaking to 
the media, particularly regarding housing-related issues. A 
Resident Advisor in another residence hall confirmed the 
information in a subsequent message. 
A Resident Advisor who agreed to speak with The Daily 
on the condition of anonymity for fear of professional 
retaliation said the increase of COVID-19 cases in residence 
halls has made it difficult to continue with day-to-day RA 
duties. The Resident Advisor will be referred to as Charlie.
“It has kind of made me scared to go on duty,” Charlie 
said. “Specifically, just going to the bathroom because 

certain residents who have community bathrooms that 
have tested positive have not been taken to quarantine 
right away. One resident in particular has been (taken to 
quarantine) but it took more than 24 hours. A positive test 
was reported yesterday around 10 a.m., and they just got 
taken today at around 1 p.m.”
Charlie said their residents have elected to self-isolate 
when in close contact with a COVID-positive student 
despite University guidelines which do not require students 
with a COVID-19 booster shot who are asymptomatic to 
quarantine.
“I think that students are probably going to be suffering 
because they’re trying to be more responsible than the 
University is,” Charlie said. 
Addressing circulating rumors of limited Q&I housing, 
University spokesperson Rick Fitzgerald wrote in an email 
to The Daily about the current situation of Q&I housing.
“Q&I housing is not full,” Fitzgerald said. “Today we 
are at about 12 percent of a total capacity of more than 
400 beds. And the university is working to increase that 
overall capacity. There are delays in responding to students 
who have tested positive, but on-campus students will be 
relocated to Q&I housing as soon as possible.”
The 12% referred to Thursday morning’s update. As of 
Friday, that number was revised to 35%.
Xu also said the safety policies in the dorm were loosely 
enforced, making him feel uncomfortable. Prior to the 
winter 2022 semester, students were not required to 
wear face masks in their own residence halls, including in 
common areas. In December, the policy shifted, requiring 
all students in residence halls to wear face masks through 
at least Jan. 17, regardless of vaccination status. 

“In classes, I feel very safe because everybody wears 
masks,” Xu said. “I feel less safe in the campus housing 
because people are just not wearing masks when they 
should.”
Xu said because his roommate — who has not tested 
positive for COVID-19 — and himself are both unable to 
find alternative housing, they must coexist in their dorm 
room while wearing masks at all times except for sleeping. 
During a RHA meeting on Thursday, members 
expressed concerns regarding COVID-19 positive students 
remaining in the dorms for extended periods of time after 
receiving a positive test result.
Members of the student body have also taken to social 
media to share their difficulties with being transferred 
to Q&I housing. Some students have said their MCards 
were frozen, denying them access to dining halls. Others 
have said that Q&I housing had forgotten to prepare meals 
for students in their residency. Broekhuizen denied both 
rumors of COVID-positive students’ MCards being frozen 
and that Q&I housing is forgetting to prepare meals for 
students. 
LSA 
junior 
Isabel 
Rodriguez 
critiqued 
the 
administration’s approach to the Winter 2022 semester and 
said that it didn’t account for the stress it put on students.
 “(They’re) just kind of saying, well, like ‘You guys can 
handle it. You’re young. You won’t get sick from it because 
you’re vaccinated’, which isn’t necessarily true,” Rodriguez 
said.

“I just want to fast forward 
to the part of my life when 
everything is okay,” Issa says 
to her reflection in the mirror. 
It’s a statement that we can all 
get behind.
Life has its trials and tribu-
lations. Oftentimes, it feels 
like there’s no possible way to 
get through the storm. But the 
series finale of HBO’s “Inse-
cure” is proof that things do 
eventually work out in the end; 
we just have to stop standing 
in our own way.
Created and written by Issa 
Rae (“The Lovebirds”), “Inse-
cure” is a dramedy television 
series partially based on her 
web series “Awkward Black 
Girl.” After blessing the screen 
with five amazing seasons, the 
show is a monument of signifi-
cant representation of modern 
Black women within friend-
ships, relationships and every-
thing else in between.
The finale seals the deal and 
confirms the legacies of the 
main cast in their exit from the 
show. It fast forwards to all 
the big moments that will hap-
pen between Issa (Issa Rae, “A 
Black Lady Sketch Show), Kelli 
(Natasha 
Rothwell, 
“Baby 
Shark’s Big Show!”), Molly 
(Yvonne Orji, “A Black Lady 
Sketch Show”) and Tiffany 
(Amanda Seales, “The Story of 
Our Times”), such as the girls 
getting together for Molly 
and 
Issa’s 
birthday 
party, 
Kelli starting a new chapter 
in her life and the girls visit-
ing Tiffany after her move to 
Denver. However, the episode 
also illustrates struggles, such 
as Issa’s having to make the 
decision between being with 
Nathan (Kendrick Sampson, 
“How to Make Love to a Black 
Woman”) or Lawrence (Jay 
Ellis, “Escape Room: Tourna-
ment of Champions”) and Mol-
ly’s overcoming a sudden death 
in the family. At the end of it 
all, the episode tells the audi-
ence that everything will be 

okay for the group of friends.
While the series embraces 
interpersonal 
relationships 
between Black women, what 
stands out the most is the epi-
sode’s ability to show what it 
takes to make decisions con-
fidently. When Issa invites 
Lawrence over for a tour of her 
new office space, she reflects 
on what it took to get to where 
she is now, realizing it was her 
own anxious thoughts that 
kept her from her true wishes 
and hindered her potential. 
Issa is now consciously aware 
that she has full control over 
her life and that when she lets 
doubt stand in the way of mak-
ing decisions, she has no one to 
blame but herself.
The finale also portrays the 
true meaning of friendship. 
At moments, we see Molly 
grieving over a sudden death 
in her family. Fast forward 
to the night of her wedding, 
when Molly shows gratitude 
for her friendship with Issa. 
This dynamic shows that their 
friendship is what keeps Molly 
strong. With Issa in her cor-
ner, she believes that she can 
get through anything.
“Insecure” does a fantas-
tic job of making sure the 
viewers have an insight into 
some of the real-life dynam-
ics between Black women. The 
finale inspires the viewers to 
have empathy for all the char-
acters, not just Issa.
By the end of the series, the 
women learn how to go through 
the motions of life and expect 
the unexpected. Sure enough, 
life throws a few curveballs, 
but choosing to stay firm with 
the decisions you make in 
those tumultuous times and 
relying on healthy friendships 
will see you through. Eventu-
ally, everything will be okay.

“Don’t Look Up” is a film that plays 
things safe but thinks it is doing something 
brave. The film, co-written and directed 
by Adam McKay (“The Big Short”), is an 
allegory for climate change, providing 
audiences with the ambivalent reactions of 
the media and government leaders to the 
impending doom of the planet presented by 
a comet heading towards the earth. In this 
story, the comet is discovered by Randall 
Mindy (Leonardo DiCaprio, “Once Upon 
a Time in Hollywood”) and Kate Dibiasky 
(Jennifer Lawrence, “X-Men: Dark Phoe-
nix”), who continually try and fail to get 
people to realize the apocalypse is coming.
The film delivers its story and overall 
message with a sense of self-importance 
that is unwarranted. Yes, it is important to 
sound the alarms and take action against 
the developing climate disaster, but any-
one who is aware of the effects of climate 
change is likely already trying to do some-
thing about it. Not only that, but the major-
ity of the people that will see this movie 
are already in that camp, meaning McKay 
and co-writer David Sirota (a journalist 
and former Bernie Sanders campaign advi-
sor) spend two hours preaching to an echo 
chamber that already believes in the mes-
sage.
By the time Randall Mindy gives his 
Howard Beale-esque “I’m mad as hell” rant 
on live television towards the end of the 
film, he’s essentially just explicitly re-stat-
ing what the message of the film is to the 
few members of the audience that didn’t 
understand what took place in the previous 
two hours. The lack of subtle commentary 
isn’t necessarily a bad thing, in fact, it can 
be quite provocative and effective at times 
— see the ending of Spike Lee’s “BlacK-
kKlansman.” However, “Don’t Look Up”’s 
ideas are not elusive, bold or provocative in 
the slightest.
Because the film’s climate change mes-
sage has no weight behind it (given the 
audience’s preexisting understanding of its 

drastic effects), it becomes nothing more 
than a perfectly adequate drama. It rarely 
feels boring, seeming more focused than 
the rest of McKay’s filmography. His previ-
ous two films, “The Big Short” and “Vice,” 
were very messy in their execution (for 
good and bad). Both tried to go for a hybrid 
drama-sketch comedy tone that only kind 
of works in “The Big Short” and doesn’t 
work at all in “Vice.” McKay has ditched 
that for the most part and “Don’t Look 
Up” then works as a fairly straightforward 
drama with some heightened, cartoonish 
characters.
Docu-drama handheld cinematography 
and frantic editing, McKay’s trademark, 
are still here but feel more toned down 
than usual. Neither works particularly 
well (apart from the wild cutting taking 
place when Dr. Mindy is having anxiety 
attacks) and when the film’s cinematog-
raphy doesn’t look downright ugly, it just 
looks fairly bland. It makes sense that this 
film was released on Netflix because it isn’t 
particularly cinematic; it looks like an epi-
sode of “Succession” with a bigger budget.
“Don’t Look Up” so desperately wants 
to be this generation’s “<a href=”https://
www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-mov-
ie-dr-strangelove-1964”>Dr. Strangelove</
a>,” that it not only tries to capture its tone 
but also references similar key details like 
its use of a World War II-era love song as a 
sign of the apocalypse.
I appreciate what McKay tries to do in 
his films because his ideas in terms of con-
tent and form are quite unique compared to 
mainstream Hollywood filmmaking. They 
don’t always work — “Vice” really struggles 
and it took me three viewings to finally 
come around on “The Big Short” — but the 
attempts are never complete failures. His 
projects, including this one, always have 
potential, but he never finds the right bal-
ance in his execution, which leads to either 
wildly messy projects or an uninteresting 
final product. “Don’t Look Up” is unfortu-
nately the latter.

‘Insecure’ finale tells 
us that everything will 
be okay, eventually 

Before watching “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” I was 
extremely worried it would be bloated and not make 
sense. I am a big fan of everything Spider-Man, and I was 
afraid the movie would try to ride off of its MCU status 
instead of being good on its own. I was happy to discover 
that it did not do this, instead actually taking some major 
risks with its characters that ultimately pay off in a very 
emotional movie.
The movie starts off right where “Spider-Man: Far 
From Home” left off, with Peter’s (Tom Holland, “Chaos 
Walking”) identity revealed to the world. I am going to 
try to avoid spoilers as much as possible and just stick to 
what was shown in the trailers, and just a fair warning, 
watching this movie with as few spoilers as possible is 
the best way to watch it. The film is full of remarkable 
dramatic reveals — all of which are best left unsaid to 
those who want to watch it unspoiled.
Willam Dafoe (“The Lighthouse”) is a national trea-
sure. He plays one of many returning villains in the 
movie, but his Green Goblin is the ultimate villain out of 
them all. Willam Dafoe elevates the role in everything he 
does, fully immersing himself in the character in a way 
that I just loved. The Green Goblin is not just a crazy 
killer; he actually challenges Peter Parker ethically. 
Throughout the movie, Peter struggles to get everything 
he wants, attempting to return to a normal teenage life 
while still being Spider-Man. The Green Goblin wants 
to convince Peter that he is unable to use his powers to 
save everyone; he can’t live a normal life and will have to 
sacrifice his morals in order to win.
Tom Holland’s Peter Parker stood out amongst other 
superhero movies for its lack of a true origin story. Audi-
ences generally already know how Peter Parker becomes 
Spider-Man; they did not need to see it again. “Spider-
Man: No Way Home” is the origin movie that the MCU 
never gave him. In this movie, we see Peter mature and 
make difficult decisions, fully coming into his role as 
Spider-Man and living up to the classic words of “with 
great power comes great responsibility.” 
This movie makes many bold choices with the char-
acter of Peter Parker, forcing him to choose between his 
personal life and saving as many people as possible, with 
Holland giving an extremely compelling performance 
that adds to the complexity of Peter’s decisions. The film 
rises above the heightened action scenes, giving some 
incredibly emotional interactions and confirming my 
personal undying love of Spider-Man as a character.
That all being said, “Spider-Man: No Way Home” does 
have all of the usual MCU-specific problems: A lot of the 

humor is very quippy (passable, but with occasionally 
cringey lines), the fights are full of quick cuts between 
CGI-ed characters and it still solidly fits within the MCU 
format of the first act being set-up, the second act being 
the hero struggling to beat the villain and the third act 
being a big action set-piece. Many people are getting 
tired of the repetitiveness of Marvel movies, and this 
movie definitely didn’t get rid of the highly over-pro-
duced aspects of the MCU.
This movie is not perfect. I know some people com-
plained about plot holes it created in the MCU canon, 
but I found the explanations to make enough sense that 
I could just go with the flow. The ending itself has con-
fusing bits, but it seems like that is done on purpose to 
create anticipation for future movies.
In all, “No Way Home” is still an engaging movie, 
which makes it that much more impressive. It drew me in 
despite the formulaic nature of most MCU movies, with 
the ties into the rest of the films never really distract-
ing from the heart of the movie. It has actual emotional 
depth that will definitely make it stand out in the coming 
years of constant MCU content. I think overall the movie 
is one of the best representations of superheroes on the 
big screen, showing how they can really address moral 
questions, while still giving a blockbuster experience.
be expected when they created this universe a decade 
ago. The sheer gravity of a decade, ten years, is in itself 
an ode to the passion of fandoms that really love what 
they create. Superwholock was a god. Today it is a house 
of memories built with love and care, its doors open to 
generations to come for several more decades.

“I am a bad mother, but I am 
learning to be good.”
Jessamine Chan’s dystopian novel 
“The School for Good Mothers” is 
not perfect by any means — neither 
is its heroine, Frida. However, Chan 
has constructed both a novel and 
a character that demonstrate the 
desperate yearning and burnout of 
motherhood with a level of depth that 
few other works of literature have 
achieved.
“The School for Good Mothers” 
focuses on Frida Liu, a Chinese 
American mother living in a near-
future, seemingly normal version 
of Philadelphia, who is exhausted 
from fighting her ex-husband over 
custody of their baby, Harriet. 
Frida’s 
postpartum 
depression, 
Zoloft withdrawals and exhaustion 
produce a state of fatigue that leads 
her to leave the house and Harriet 
for a few hours. Upon returning 
home, she is confronted by the police 
and her ex-husband who send her 
to a rehabilitation camp for a year, 
where she will learn how to be a good 
mother. The middle portion of the 
novel is set in the “school,” located in 
an abandoned college campus, where 
mothers are subjected to strange, 
unspeakable horrors. If Frida doesn’t 
succeed, she will lose her ability to see 
Harriet. 
Motherhood is often talked about 
in art but until recently, has rarely 

been contextualized in the limitations 
of humans. Maternal mental health, 
especially, is overlooked; more than 
one in ten mothers struggle with 
postpartum depression, but the topic 
has long been considered taboo. 
Frida Liu, Chan’s protagonist in 
the “School for Good Mothers,” is 
deeply depressed. She’s also a single 
mother fighting for custody. As 
Frida flounders, the novelist displays 
a tension between the needs of a 
drained mother and her baby. 
In demonstrating this tension, 
Chan undertakes a hefty task: to 
persuade the reader to see the 
humanity in a mother who did, in fact, 
neglect her daughter. The novel is an 
excellent, compelling commentary 
on what it means to deal with mental 
illness as a mother. Frida struggles 
against herself, attempting to change; 
however, a lack of support stemming 
from society’s refusal to see mothers 
as people sends her character further 
into heartsickness.
“The School for Good Mothers” 
not only highlights the challenge all 
mothers face of being “good” in the 
eyes of society, but also makes room 
for the compounded pressure placed 
upon women and mothers of color 
to assimilate to the status quo. One 
specific way Chan accomplishes this 
is through the character of Frida’s 
ex-husband’s 
mistress 
and 
new 
girlfriend, Susanna. While Frida is 
away learning how to be a “good” 
mother, Susanna parents Harriet with 
methods that seem to be taken straight 

from Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop: 
she is the epitome of white “woke” 
motherhood 
and 
pseudoscience, 
laden with essential oils and organic 
foods in lieu of medical necessities.
Additionally, women of different 
races are treated differently by the 
“school”: white and Asian women 
are offered easier chores, while 
Black and Hispanic women are 
regularly forced to do taxing manual 
labor. Additionally, these mothers 
are offered less forgiveness by the 
government, as well as the camp’s 
administration. Frida is relatively 
privileged, yet she is constantly singled 
out by others for being “alien” — as the 
only Asian American person in the 
camp, Frida is judged as a function of 
her “otherness.” Chan demonstrates 
different levels of a specific racial 
hierarchy in “The School for Good 
Mothers” in a way that feels like a 
microcosm of American tensions as 
well as a perfect portrayal of how 
strict socioeconomic expectations 
of motherhood harm marginalized 
communities of color most.
Throughout Frida’s time at the 
“school,” she is consistently corrected 
by her supervisors for being too 
cold and apathetic in her parenting 
style, while she feels she is simply 
mirroring 
her 
own 
more-than-
adequate upbringing. “The School 
for Good Mothers” highlights the 
difficulties mothers face, especially 
those with intersectional identities: 
are styles of parenting normalized in 
marginalized communities simply 

misunderstood by a majority-white 
society? Or are they harmful? Frida 
turns this dichotomy over her mind, 
eventually believing in the inferiority 
of her parenting the longer she stays 
in “school.” Frida’s own parents, 
however, truly love and care for 
her; they support Frida while she 
struggles, and cry when they see 
her mistreated. Chan illustrates the 
difficulties and insecurities of child-
raising vividly: the competition, 
the 
enforced 
heterogeneity, 
the 
suppression. When mothers exist in 
an echo chamber of opinions of what 
is “best” for their child, they feel it is 
necessary to hide their complexities. 
Frida is consistently forced to hide 
multiple parts of her identity in order 
to be a “good mother,” which is a 
realistic depiction of the way many 
today are expected to parent.
One of the story’s weaker aspects 
was its lack of commitment to other 
main ideas outside of or overlapping 
with the struggles of motherhood. At 
times, it seemed that Chan wanted 
to make a point regarding the issues 
that less economically advantaged 
mothers face, yet nearly all of her main 
characters were well-off. Chan also 
seemed to want to use the opposing 
“School for Good Fathers” to highlight 
the special pressure placed on mothers 
as opposed to fathers, but failed to 
make any deep cutting remarks on 
the subject, nor did the introduction 
of the counterpart “school” for fathers 
allow for any meaningful character 
development for the mothers. Other 

thematic 
discrepancies, 
such 
as 
inconsistent characterization and the 
unclear explanation of the dystopian 
setting, left this novel feeling more like 
a first draft than a final and complete 
piece of work. The real triumph 
comes from the personal and intimate 
portrayal of Frida’s struggles trying to 
be “good.” 
Make no mistake — parts of the 
story feel too on-the-nose. A hallmark 
of good dystopian fiction is its 
plausibility and hypothetical history; 
however, aspects of “The School for 
Good Mothers” feel heavy-handed 
and unexplained, so much so that it 
was hard to accept as believable. The 
entire premise of Frida being cast off 
to a parental rehabilitation camp for 
leaving her baby alone for a few hours 
feels like overkill for a governmental 
system so vaguely addressed within 
the novel. Additionally, the lack 
of motivation provided for most 
characters in the novel made them feel 
like caricatures. “School” facilitators 
such as Ms. Khoury and Ms. Russo 
felt like one-note villains who were 
unsympathetic in their actions and 
words; it felt hard to believe that while 
torturing and separating troubled 
mothers from their children, they 
offered fake sympathies because they 
“get it” — they have a niece! However, 
if you strip these parts away, what’s 
left is the intense story of a complex 
character who is struggling against 
mental illness while trying her 
hardest to be a good mother. 
The middle section of the novel, 

in which Frida is sent to the actual 
“School for Good Mothers”, drags. 
This isn’t necessarily a mistake — in 
fact, the novel’s form vividly portrays 
the deep depression into which Frida 
sinks. However, the unnecessary 
abundance of detail weighs the book 
down. This novel would be best read 
in chunks, because it can sometimes 
read as though the deeply flawed 
Frida is pulling the reader down with 
her. Still, in its redeeming parts, Frida’s 
emotions are so exhaustively detailed 
that they feel tangible: whenever 
Frida 
interacts 
with 
Harriet, 
whether it is through a phone call, 
a social worker or even through her 
thoughts, the stressful desperation is 
overwhelming. The most rousing part 
of the novel is the conclusion, which is 
a wild, vague reversal of the beginning 
that leaves the reader reeling in shock. 
While there were definite flaws 
within 
“The 
School 
for 
Good 
Mothers,” the book offers raw emotion 
from a complex antihero in a rare 
fashion. The quick bursts of feeling are 
enough to keep the reader going (but 
not fully satisfied) while slogging their 
way through the novel. Additionally, 
the small mentions of Frida’s parents 
trying their best to take care of her are 
incredibly grounding. The book isn’t 
perfect, but Jessamine Chan’s novel 
is nothing if not an intense, messy 
and sometimes beautiful portrait of 
motherhood that will make readers 
question their perception of what 
being a “good mother” really means.

Let’s be real — it has been a very 
trying time. For Gen Zennials 
like myself, our situation often 
feels 
bleak 
in 
general. 
So, 
as much as I appreciate the 
intensity and social commentary 
of “Squid Game” and company, 
it’s “Penguins of Madagascar” 
that has my heart, even after all 
this time. 
We 
first 
saw 
the 
iconic 
foursome 
— 
Skipper 
(Tom 
McGrath, “The Boss Baby 2: 
Family 
Business”), 
Private 
(Christopher Knights, “Penguins 
of Madagascar: the Movie”), 
Rico (Conrad Vernon, “Donkey’s 
Caroling 
Christmas-tacular” 
and 
John 
DiMaggio, 
“Inside 
Job”) 
and 
Kowalski 
(Chris 
Miller, “Puss in Boots: The 
Last Wish”) — that inspired the 
spinoff in the Dreamworks 2005 
animated feature “Madagascar.” 
Skipper 
delivered 
what 
is 
arguably the franchise’s most 
dearly remembered line: “Just 
smile and wave boys, smile 
and wave.” From that moment 
on, 
these 
wholesome 
Seal 
Team 6 wannabes established 
themselves as No. 1 on the 
field and No. 1 in my heart, and 
certainly deserving of their own 
show — one that was written 
with 
humor 
when 
so 
many 
shows today take themselves too 
seriously.
They are, simply put, the 
perfect group. You have Skipper, 
the boss; Kowalski, the smart 
one; Private, the sensitive one, 
and naturally, Rico, the explosive 
one. Something for everyone! 
They aren’t trying to stamp out 
international terrorism, they’re 
trying to secure popcorn — and 
I like it that way. It’s nice to 
have a break from death and 
destruction while lost in penguin 
exploits, which are especially 
funny because they believe their 
missions and foes to be equally 
serious. At the first sign of 
trouble, they snap into position 
as dramatic music plays and 
raise their flippers into fighting 
positions. 
Their battles with Alice (Mary 
Scheer, “iCarly”) bring me a 
special joy. Zookeeper Alice is 
the Karen to end all Karens. She 
doesn’t just want to speak with 
the manager — she demands 
it. As the cast identifies in the 
first episode, for every Alice you 
destroy, more come in her place. 
In real life, you have to play nice 
with Zookeeper Alice. In this 
magical escape, the penguins 
play to win and outsmart her 

at every turn. She’s suspicious 
of them from day one, forcing 
the penguins to go to extreme 
lengths to divert her attention 
to ensure their secrets don’t 
become public. When Private 
accidentally becomes an internet 
star due to the zoo’s newly 
installed webcams, there are 
eyes on the penguin HQ at all 
times. Luckily, Alice becomes the 
next overnight sensation when 
the camera swings towards her 
instead as she swings her hips to 
whatever is playing on her iPod. 
The 
penguins 
aren’t 
just 
highly trained agents hardened 
by their harrowing missions 
gone wrong. The show is rife 
with softer moments, such as 
their protection over an egg that 
Marlene (Nicole Sullivan, “High 
School Musical: The Musical: 
The Series”) finds and places in 
their care, although they each 
have rather different plans for its 
development. The egg ultimately 
belongs to a mother duck, but 
they still have room in their 
family for the little duckling 
all the same. The elite force is 
deeply pure, with goodness in 
their hearts, as much as they 
attempt to highlight their status 
as “trained professionals.” 
This is to say nothing of their 
rivalry with King Julien (Danny 
Jacobs, “All Hail King Julien”) — 
semi-affectionately referred to 
as “Ringtail” — and the lemurs. 
We all see ourselves in Maurice 
(Cedric the Entertainer, “The 
Neighborhood”) these days (read: 
exhausted), and while Julien is 
annoying, the show doesn’t try to 
pass it off as acceptable — we see 
the penguins lose their minds 
over their loud, inconsiderate 
neighbors just like we do ours. 
At one point, the ambitious 
penguins literally attempt to 
vacation on the moon via what 
seems to be an oversized trash 
can armed with road flares to 
escape the lemurs — if only. 
Regardless, when Julien is in 
danger, Skipper and the boys 
still do everything they can to 
save him.
Of course, no show is without 
its 
failures. 
I 
feel 
it’s 
my 
journalistic duty to acknowledge 
the work as a whole, so I 
mention the racist nature of 
the zoo’s gorilla characters and 
Mort’s (Andy Richter, “Elf”) 
foot fetish, which are, to put it 
mildly, uncool. Still, “Penguins” 
is there for you when you most 
need it. “Bring me your tired, 
your weary,” it says. “If only for 
20 minutes, I will banish the 
darkness.”

Why ‘Penguins 
of Madagascar’ is 
unironically my favorite 
show

Prestige pictures, movies that are 
made to garner critical acclaim and 
win awards, are often more subtle and 
intellectual than their blockbuster and 
more commercial peers —or at least they 
pretend to be. They are usually helmed 
by a more singular voice and make 
attempts to respect their audiences by 
not spelling things out. Some movie-
goers appreciate a movie that behaves 
almost like a puzzle, and they take 
pride in their success in solving it. But 
some prestige pictures can at times 
leave so few clues that the experience 
can become frustrating, and this is the 
case with Jane Campion’s (“The Piano”) 
“Power of the Dog.” 
That being said, the three central 
performances 
are 
all 
forceful 
and 
appropriate. 
Kirsten 
Dunst 
(“Melancholia”) as Rose is reserved 
and clearly full of opinions that she 
holds back to remain civil with her 
domineering brother-in-law Phil, who 
does not hide his distaste for her. As 
the movie goes on, her discomfort with 
his presence is communicated through 
looks and movement alone. Kodi Smit-
McPhee (“ParaNorman”) plays her son 
Peter and is centered and seems very 
astute to the audience. The standout 
performance is the much advertised 
Benedict Cumberbatch (“Spider-Man: 
No Way Home”) as the previously-
mentioned brother-in-law Phil Burbank. 
He is the most expressive and dynamic 
character, and his malice and desire for 

control is visible from everything from 
the way he walks to the slightest facial 
twitches. 
This film is visually gorgeous and 
crafted with a precise understanding 
of movement and blocking. The way its 
atmosphere is built with meticulous and 
specific editing is comparable to other 
perfectionist auteurs such as David 
Fincher (“Gone Girl”). But Jane Campion 
has a style of her own, and it shows 
here: She uses every tool at her disposal 
to create a mood that is unique to this 
story and to her directorial approach. 
Cinematographer Ari Wegner’s (“Zola” ) 
use of light and shadows helps establish 
the power dynamics that are necessary 
for this film to function, and wide, 
landscape shots help construct the 
Western setting. Jonny Greenwood’s 
score elevates this, evoking memories 
of his past work — the orchestration 
resembles “There Will Be Blood” — and 
is equally important in building a tense, 
hostile atmosphere. 
All these factors combined make for a 
relentless, but slow and deliberate two 
hours of the characters (mostly Phil) 
doing what they can to assert their will 
and control people. In the first half or so, 
this works wonders, creating an intensity 
that is difficult to pull away from — 
watching Phil slowly and indirectly 
impose his will on Rose is hypnotizing. 
But during the second half, when the 
film focuses on the interactions between 
Peter and Phil, some of the major twists 
and turns of the plot are so subtle and 
glossed over that the ending comes 
across as weak at best, and incoherent 

at worst. Subtlety and understatement 
are almost necessities in modern award-
season films, but there is a point where 
not spelling out every mystery can 
cease to be intelligent and rewarding 
and instead become obnoxious and 
unpleasant for the viewer. 
There are a lot of impressive techniques 
and skills expressed in “The Power of the 
Dog,” but the true story is too shrouded 
behind layers of pseudo-intellectualism, 
which keeps the viewing experience 
from being fruitful and fulfilling. It’s 
obvious that Campion and company 
wanted to create a masterpiece, but 
ironically they would have likely been 
successful if they weren’t so focused on 
making one artificially. 
Instead, I believe the song is meant 
to empower women to speak out when 
things don’t feel right and to claim 
the space they need to talk about what 
happened, without the fear of being 
slighted.
Although “All Too Well” is specific 
to Swift’s personal experiences, her 
attention to detail is what makes the 
song all the more relatable to any 
listener; Swift’s story is powerful, but 
the real punch behind the song is the 
suggestion that the small moments 
matter and shouldn’t be ignored. “All 
Too Well” made me feel seen in ways 
that I’ve never experienced with a song 
before: There’s a special kind of magic 
that exists when you realize that you’re 
not alone in the pains you’ve suffered, 
and that it’s OK to feel even the small 
things deeply.

‘The Power of the Dog’ is stunning and wonderfully acted,

In high school when I was struggling with 
my sexuality, my future always looked blurry. 
Whenever I would think about my late 20s and 
30s, I had no idea what my romantic life would 
look like. Everything was in the air. Would I 
ever come out? Would my family accept me? 
Would I ever be comfortable with who I am? 
Growing up as a closeted bisexual, I never 
really believed in love. I remember seeing 
Instagram posts in high school with captions 
writing about how in love the pictured people 
were, and I would ask myself how 16- and 
17-year-olds could possibly know what love is. 
Looking back, I was just entertaining a very 
naive perception I had of others in love. I was 
jealous of everyone else dating and finding 
love interests; I wanted to be “normal” and 
easily find a partner, but that wasn’t my reality. 
Though I knew most of my friends would be 
accepting, I wasn’t ready to come out and was 
far from the idea of pursuing a relationship.

Though I dated girls when I was young, I 
knew that these relationships wouldn’t last. 
These romances were short-lived and made 
me feel better about myself. Yes, I knew I was 
gay, but these relationships were experiences 
that society and heteronormativity forced me 
to have. I didn’t come to terms with my sexual-
ity until the middle of high school. Before then, 
I only had experiences with girls and hadn’t 
yet developed an attraction for guys. As these 
relationships ended and as I got older, I had to 
come to terms with who I was and “explore” a 
new side of myself I couldn’t ignore. 
In an attempt to explore my identity, I 
(unfortunately) downloaded Grindr, a “social 
media” app for gay men. As a 19-year-old 
newly-out person, I wanted to check out this 
community and what it had to offer. Though 
I wasn’t on the app to find love, it was a very 
… informative experience on what hook-up 
culture was like in the community. I had only 
come out a couple of months prior and was 
ready to check out this side of my sexuality, but 
I was definitely not trying to find love — espe-
cially through Grindr. 

After being on the app for a couple of 
months, I met a guy who was different from 
the others I’d met. We had only met each other 
twice when I realized there was a connection 
that I had never experienced before. The sec-
ond time we met, we stayed up late into the 
night and talked for hours — constantly find-
ing things we had in common. Whether it was 
finally being able to experience what straight 
people often take for granted, or simply being 
happy that I was able to express romantic 
emotions, I was excited to feel normal in the 
privacy of my apartment, free from society’s 
judgment. 
During this time, I was sharing a one-bed-
room apartment with a roommate who ended 
up moving out, giving me and my new roman-
tic interest the opportunity to spend a lot more 
time with one other. He would come over, we 
would make dinner, drink wine and watch a 
movie. Back then, this was the only thing that 
was getting me through my Zoom classes and 
feelings of isolation in my lonely apartment. 
It was an experience that was so exciting and 
new. When he was over, everything felt so 

normal — something I never thought I would 
experience.
Little did I know back then that I was fall-
ing in love. These moments felt so normal yet 
were the most exciting times of my daily life. If 
someone would’ve told me a year earlier that I 
would have someone I loved, I would’ve never 
believed them. 
Soon, these exciting dinner moments 
turned into an everyday thing. He slowly 

began to bring his things into my apartment. 
His toothbrush and contact holder for just-in-
case situations ended up next to mine in my 
bathroom. Then came an extra day’s worth of 
clothes in his backpack, followed by his next 
day’s worth of Zoom school work, and all of a 
sudden his wardrobe was sharing what was 
now our closet. 

I think about death daily. It might be 
morbid, but meditating on the grand-
est mystery of our existence gives me 
a certain kind of comfort that you can’t 
get from anywhere else. 
Our modern American culture has 
no time for pondering or praying. No 
time for meditation. No time to imag-
ine. There is no time for the mystical 
when we’re trapped on an egotistical 
carousel of capital accumulation and 
exploitation. We have been condi-
tioned to spend our lives in service 
to our senses, entertaining ourselves 
with an excess of foods to eat, alco-
hol to drink, drugs to use, clothes to 
wear and media to mindlessly indulge 
in. And if we’re not doing that, we’re 
wearily working ourselves, intermina-
bly in pursuit of a comfortable career 
to uphold these luxurious lifestyles. 
What this way of living doesn’t entail 

is an engagement beyond what can 
only be perceived with our five senses 
or understood by an interim intellect. 
We all know these subjective, short-
lived sources of pleasure that we pride 
and provide ourselves with are always 
transient 
sources 
of 
gratification, 
yet we fill our days and nights chas-
ing them, woefully missing out on the 
bliss that comes from connecting to 
the divine, the eternal absolute, which 
lasts forever. 
A friend of mine once said that our 
relationship to death informs our rela-
tionship to all endings in life. Or, as 
American author Steve Bouma-Pre-
diger puts it, our “eschatology shapes 
(our) ethics.” Our attitude toward the 
ending of a day, a season, a year, an 
era, a class, a club, a project, a semes-
ter, a friendship, a romance, a piece of 
art, everything in our lives is a direct 
reflection of our attitude toward the 
end of our life — and what lies beyond. 

Since 1978, “Orientalism,” by late Pal-
estinian-American 
academic 
Edward 
Said, has served as the basis for many 
academic courses focused on West Asia 
and North Africa. Widely considered one 
of the first works of postcolonial theory, 
it describes the West’s misperception 
and misrepresentation of the “Orient” 
— a term used by Westerners to identify 
Africa, Asia and their inhabitants in an 
exoticized and often disparaging way. 
But despite challenging Western aca-
demia and creating positive shifts within 
it, Said’s work also has major shortcom-
ings that must be recognized, specifically 
regarding the narratives of indigenous 
minority groups in West Asia and North 
Africa. 
In “Orientalism,” Said describes the 
West’s harmful tendency of generalizing 
the “Orient” as one region with indis-
tinct societies, cultures, structures and 
other qualities. This is most often done 

through art, as architectural styles and 
stereotypical clothing from one particu-
lar region appear in pieces meant to rep-
resent a completely different place. The 
generalization of different people groups 
and regions creates a false image of them, 
as their distinctiveness is erased. Fur-
ther highlighting Orientalism’s harm-
ful impacts, Said states, “the Orient and 
Islam have a kind of extra-real, phenom-
enologically reduced status that puts 
them out of reach of everyone except the 
Western expert. From the beginning of 
Western speculation about the Orient, 

the one thing the Orient could not do was 
to represent itself.”
Everything Said stated regarding 
Western notions of Africa and Asia holds 
true. However, the irony behind Said’s 
argument lies in his own flawed concep-
tion of West Asia and North Africa. When 
describing the region, Said employs the 
terms “Arab World” and “Islamic World.” 
He often uses them interchangeably, fail-
ing to underscore the difference between 
the two. Noting this distinction is essen-
tial when challenging Western notions, 
which regard Arabs and Muslims synony-
mously despite one being an ethnic group 
and another being a religious group. 
Furthermore, not only did he employ 
the terms with minimal distinction, he 
also used them to represent a region with 
many non-Arab and non-Muslim identi-
ties. Minority groups such as Imazighen 
and Kurds typically do not fit the former 
category, those such as Arab Christians 
do not fit the latter, and others such as 
Armenians, Assyrians, Mandaeans and 
Yazidis fit neither of them. Nevertheless, 
they all natively reside in West Asia or 

North Africa, which Said mainly identi-
fies with Arabs and Muslims. Uncoinci-
dentally, the groups in the last category 
have faced the most erasure throughout 
history because not only are they mis-
understood by Westerners, but they are 
also misunderstood by the larger, typi-
cally Arab and/or Muslim groups from 
the same region. Using the terms “Arab 
World” and “Islamic World” further 
contributes to this erasure, as they fail 
to capture the diversity of the region by 
assigning it to a single identity. 
Said’s disregard for minority groups in 

his works on West Asia and North Africa 
has contributed to misconceptions by 
majority groups from the region. Many 
fail to understand that “Orientalism” was 
written from an occidental perspective, 
meaning its target audience was West-
ern, mainly white, readers, not minorities 
native to the region. When minorities dis-
cuss the marginalization, discrimination 
and oppression their groups have under-
gone in their homelands, many members 
of majority groups use arguments from 
“Orientalism” and similar works against 
them. For example, many will deny the 
distinct identities of minorities, accusing 
them of having their identities influenced 
by the West’s negative perceptions of 
Arabs and Muslims. Ignorant responses 
as such add to the irony, as minorities 
were not just affected by Orientalism 
like their majority counterparts, but also 
impacted by it to a greater degree due to 
the lack of knowledge and active erasure 
of their identities in the first place.
In particular, the case of the Assyrians 
provides a classic example of a minority 
group enduring oppression and misrep-
resentation from both Westerners and 
regional groups. As an ethnic minority 
that mainly practices Christianity, Assyr-
ians have faced persecution for their eth-
nic and religious identities throughout 
history. Subsequent wars, ethnic cleans-
ing and religious persecution in recent 
years have uprooted Assyrians from 
their indigenous homeland — regions 
of northern Iraq, southeastern Turkey, 
northwestern Iran and northeastern 
Syria. Today, the overwhelming major-
ity of them live in the West, where they 
continue to face a lack of representation. 
In southeast Michigan, for example, 
Assyrians who mainly identify with their 
religious affiliation, Chaldean Catho-
lic — an identification used as a conse-
quence of the issues at hand — comprise 
a community of 160,000 people, possibly 
greater than the number of Assyrians 
currently in Iraq, which stands at as little 
as 142,000. For reference, approximately 
500,000 Assyrians reside in the U.S.
One would expect more information 
to be available about such a large group 
in the diaspora, but to Assyrians this 
absence is not surprising. Much of the 
information about Assyrians online is 
inaccurate or deliberately divisive due to 
long-lasting impacts of ethnic repression 
in their home nations and Orientalist nar-
ratives pushed by Western missionaries.

There’s no mistake. They’re home.
Children, even those with just an 
ounce of sneakiness, look for cues to 
alert them of when their parents arrive 
home. The sound of gravel being uni-
formly crunched by wheels can serve 
as a signal to hide any evidence of the 
candy we overindulged in or a sign to 
abruptly turn off video game consoles. 
One source of stimuli I seldom missed 
was a distinct blend of scents. Usually 
generated from the manual labor jobs 
my parents are employed in, this lin-
gering concoction of smells could only 
be achieved over the span of several 
hours, the duration required for grease, 
gasoline and sweat to slowly embed 
themselves between individual cotton 
fibers. 
These aforementioned scents would 
arrive 
at 
two 
intervals 
clustered 
around the late evening, which is often 
when I’d either be reading about cur-
rent events or completing homework. 
The former activity was a favorite 
pastime of mine. I was a gluttonous 
inquisitor that consistently consumed 

articles through Business Insider and 
Bloomberg (prior to the existence of 
their paywalls). Regardless, I’d bury 
my attention into textbooks or digi-
tal screens as my parents attempted 
to decompress after an arduous day 
of work. This exact scenario unfolded 
over countless evenings throughout 
high school. Our household’s seeming-
ly mundane routine proved to be trans-
formative with each passing day, as I 
was becoming more embedded in dif-
ferent environments, like speech and 
debate club and eventually college, and 
drifting further away from the spaces 
my parents are left behind in.
Social class has outsized influence 
over the connections a person forms 
based on physical and relational prox-
imity, and these connections serve as 
important conduits for a wide spectrum 
of knowledge. Sociologists often refer 
to these concepts as social and cul-
tural capital respectively. The advent 
of the Internet, and the tools and ser-
vices that have followed, like Coursera 
and Google’s search engine, have often 
been promoted as great equalizers of 
information and opportunity.

H

arvard 
University 
recently 
announced 
an extension of their 
test-optional policy, which allows 
applicants to forgo submitting 
scores on the dreaded SAT or ACT. 
The policy, first implemented last 
year in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic, will remain in effect 
until 2026. Though the University 
of Michigan has yet to decide 
whether they will follow suit, it is 
not unreasonable to suggest that 
administrators are considering the 
idea. 
Constructing 
an 
argument 
against 
the 
consideration 
of 
standardized 
testing 
in 
U-M 
applications is simple. Our student 
body does not mirror the racial 
makeup of the state of Michigan. 
As a public university, one of our 
institution’s fundamental goals is to 
serve Michigan residents. Analysis 
from the Brookings Institution 
indicates that the large gap in 
SAT test scores between different 
racial groups can be explained by 
family 
income, 
racially-related 
test anxiety and lack of adequate 
preparation. 
They 
also 
cite 
research that finds high school 
GPA predicts college success more 
accurately than an SAT score. 
Because SAT scores influence 
where students apply, are accepted 
and how much financial aid they 
receive, this gap perpetuates the 
underrepresentation of some racial 
groups within elite colleges and 
universities. 
Proponents 
of 
standardized 
testing could counter by arguing 
that even if this outcome is not 
ideal, the SAT is an objective 
assessment. 
Unlike 
personal 
essays which can have wildly 
different levels of quality assigned 
to them based on who is reviewing 
them, an SAT score is one 
number, easily comparable across 
candidates. Proponents of testing 
argue that removing the SAT from 
the admissions process could give 
less qualified students an unfair 
advantage over those who do 
well on the test. Yes, the average 
scores for Black and Latino test 
takers both fall below the College 
Board’s 
“college 
readiness” 
benchmark, but many within 
those groups score above average. 
When admissions officers are 
deciding between two competitive 
applicants, it could theoretically 
come down to a 4.0 GPA, 1200 SAT 

and a 2.9 GPA, 1560 SAT. Relying 
more heavily on SAT scores would 
benefit the latter candidate, even 
if it was the former who worked 
harder in high school, as reflected 
in their GPA, but lacked the proper 
resources to succeed on the SAT. 
Again, noting the evidence that 
SATs are less predictive of college 
success than GPA, the emphasis on 
SATs appears unjustly important. 
Given the previously mentioned 
empirical 
link 
between 
race, income and test scores, 
underrepresented 
students 
applying to the University of 
Michigan would hopefully benefit 
from a shift away from tests. 
However, Meghan McArdle of 
the Washington Post argues that 
Harvard’s decision to continue 
being test-optional will benefit 
wealthier 
children 
instead, 
because they are more likely to 
have exemplary extracurriculars, 
grades 
and 
letters 
of 
recommendation. Without SAT 
scores, admissions officers can (or 
are forced to) justify their decisions 
using less quantitative criteria, 
making them less accountable and 
their process more opaque. 
And yet, in a larger sense, why 
has the debate over test-optional 
policies begun to dominate the 
larger conversation around solving 
educational inequality? Research 
that identified possible reasons 
for the racial gap in test scores 
also point to income and parental 
education as explanatory factors. 
Even if attending an elite school 
would 
give 
underrepresented 
students 
a 
significant 
boost 
in upward mobility, there are 
not many spots at Harvard, 
Yale, Williams or other small 
institutions able to commit an 
inordinate amount of resources to 
each student. 
Even if we accept that changing 
testing policies would increase 
the number of disadvantaged 
students attending those schools, 
that does not change the fact that, 
broadly, SAT scores show a lack of 
adequate primary and secondary 
education for a significant number 
of Americans. For students seeking 
other paths to higher education, 
they are behind, and different 
admissions 
policies 
will 
not 
change that. 
Instead of focusing narrowly 
on 
testing, 
policymakers 
should consider other methods 
of 
lessening 
inequality 
in 
college enrollment, starting by 
reevaluating how we finance 
public K-12 education. In 1994, 

the state of Michigan passed a 
proposal that increased the sales 
tax by 2% and assumed control 
over the allocation of school 
funding, replacing the old system 
based on property taxes. Studies on 
the effects of this policy found that 
it reduced disparities in per-pupil 
spending between school districts 
and increased the percentage 
of students that enrolled in and 
graduated from college. The latter 
benefit was not concentrated 
among the poorest students, but 
this is perhaps partly explained by 
the decisions made at the district 
level to allocate funding towards 
more affluent students. Despite 
that, the reform demonstrated that 
investing in primary education 
can translate into better long-term 
education outcomes. 
Another policy, introduced by 
researchers at the University of 
Michigan, found that providing 
targeted 
information 
about 
financial aid to “high-achieving, 
low income” students resulted in a 
significant increase in applications 
and 
enrollment 
among 
that 
demographic. Students already 
qualified to attend the University 
based on current standards were 
not applying or enrolling simply 
because they did not understand 
the amount of financial aid they 
would receive. 
These kinds of policies, aimed 
at reducing economic disparities 
in college admissions, may or may 
not also reduce racial disparities. 
Given the correlation between 
race, 
education 
and 
income, 
one would hope that racial and 
economic justice can be achieved in 
tandem. Removing standardized 
testing might be the most efficient 
option to quickly reduce racial 
inequality in admissions. It is 
easy to implement and does not 
require additional spending by the 
government or parents. However, 
even setting aside concerns about 
admissions transparency, is the 
most efficient solution always the 
best one? 
We spend 12 years in primary and 
secondary education but only four 
as undergraduates. Preparation 
for a successful college career 
includes the skills and experience 
one 
gains 
throughout 
their 
educational career. By focusing 
almost exclusively on how to alter 
the admissions requirements such 
that different groups can get in, we 
avoid discussing the possibilities 
that bolder, broader changes to 
public education can provide for 
the average American student. 

O

ne Democrat, from a deep-
red state smaller than 
Idaho or Nebraska, has 
attracted attention from across 
the country for his bold moves in 
an increasingly divisive political 
landscape. He has been blasted 
by members of his own party and 
praised by his opposition. Joe 
Manchin, D-W.Va., has suddenly 
emerged as a key player in U.S. 
politics. The senator, a moderate 
from West Virginia, has proved 
himself as a strong and capable 
leader willing to put country 
before party. With the next 
presidential election approaching 
rapidly, Manchin is the perfect 
embodiment of the leader America 
needs in the White House. 
Manchin has had a lengthy 
political career. He first served in 
West Virginia’s House of Delegates 
starting in 1982, before moving onto 
the State Senate and eventually 
securing the posts of secretary of 
state and governor. He then ran for 
U.S. Senate in 2010, where he has 
represented West Virginians ever 
since. 
A centrist, Manchin has played 
a key role in Senate negotiations 
throughout 
his 
tenure, 
often 
voting with Republicans. That 
oppositional posture has only 
become more pronounced since 
President Joe Biden took office at 
the beginning of this year. Manchin 
has 
wielded 
unprecedented 
influence over Biden’s agenda in the 
evenly split 50-50 Senate, where 
one vote makes all of the difference 
on many bills. His unique position 
has earned him the title of “most 
powerful man in Washington.” 
After months of negotiations, 
Manchin lived up to that title when 
he unilaterally sank Biden’s $1.75 
trillion Build Back Better social 
spending bill in dramatic fashion, a 
core piece of the president’s agenda. 
Manchin’s 
announcement 
in 
December that he would be voting 
“no” on the Build Back Better bill 
was quickly met with a storm of 
criticism from fellow Democrats. 
White House Press Secretary 
Jen Psaki accused the senator of 
reversing his position on the bill, 
stating the politician’s comments 
were “at odds with his discussions 
this week with the President, 
with White House staff, and with 
his own public utterances.” Sen. 

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said Manchin 
did not “have the courage to do the 
right thing for the working families 
of West Virginia and America,” 
daring him to vote against the 
package on the Senate floor. Rep. 
Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., said 
Manchin “has never negotiated in 
good faith” and was “obstructing 
the president’s agenda.” 
Undoubtedly, Manchin’s sudden 
announcement after months of 
progress on the bill — the price tag 
of which Democrats cut by half 
to appease Manchin and fellow 
moderates — was a shock to the 
political world. On the other side of 
the aisle, Republicans praised the 
senator’s move, with speculation 
mounting that Manchin was even 
considering flipping his affiliation 
to the Republican Party. Senate 
Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, 
R-Ky., said Republicans “would 
love to have him on our team.”
Essentially, to many Democrats 
and other staunch supporters of 
the Build Back Better bill — which 
promised over half a trillion 
dollars to combat climate change, 
$400 billion for universal pre-K 
education along with hundreds of 
billions for child tax credits, paid 
leave and Medicaid expansion — 
it appears Manchin is now seen 
as the ultimate political enemy. 
Meanwhile, Republicans see him 
as a hero who stopped a pivotal 
piece of Biden’s agenda in its 
tracks, dealing a serious blow to the 
president’s political fortunes. 
It would be a mistake to assess 
Manchin’s 
behavior 
in 
these 
superficial political terms. The 
apparent death of Build Back 
Better may be a short-term loss 
for Democrats and a win for 
Republicans, but let’s instead shift 
our focus to how it would impact 
the country. Millions of Americans 
would have benefited from some 
aspects of this unprecedented 
spending package, but the Build 
Back Better Act had obvious, 
overwhelming 
drawbacks. 
The 
Congressional 
Budget 
Office 
(CBO) found the true cost of the 
bill was far greater than Democrats 
had advertised. If passed, this 
legislation would have contributed 
to our nation’s massive $29.6 
trillion debt, which has swelled 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The 
CBO 
determined 
the 
national debt would have soared 
by a staggering $3 trillion if the 
programs in the bill continued for 
10 years, a likely scenario in this age 

of deficit spending. 
This 
package 
would 
have 
presented an unacceptable risk as 
our nation contends with historic 
levels of inflation, new uncertainty 
surrounding the omicron variant 
and 
tensions 
with 
American 
adversaries like Russia and China. 
Manchin wrote his “Democratic 
colleagues in Washington are 
determined 
to 
dramatically 
reshape our society in a way that 
leaves our country even more 
vulnerable to the threats we face.” 
While it’s critical we help workers, 
parents, students and patients 
through social spending, it needs 
to be done in a far more responsible 
fashion.
At the end of the day, if every 
politician were like Manchin, the 
Build Back Better bill never would 
have received the level of support 
it did. But most aren’t these days. 
The vast majority of our elected 
leaders would rather score political 
points by passing this bill rather 
than acknowledge the economic 
and political risks that it entails. 
For once, a politician transcended 
politics and put the needs of 
the 
country 
first, 
something 
Democrats and Republicans alike 
often cannot muster the courage 
to do. Every American — even 
the 
staunchest 
supporters 
of 
Build Back Better — should praise 
Manchin’s willingness to take a 
true risk and do what he earnestly 
believes is right for his constituents 
and the country.
Sen. Manchin — someone who 
puts Americans first and politics 
second — is the leader we all need 
in these turbulent times. We 
should all hope Manchin seizes 
the opportunity and mounts a 
run for the White House in 2024. 
Less than a year into the Biden 
administration, it’s become clear 
the current president — whose 
approval rating stands at a historic 
low — has failed to solve multiple 
crises, 
from 
Afghanistan 
to 
COVID-19. On the Republican side, 
things don’t look much better. If 
former President Donald Trump 
enters the race for a second term, 
which appears increasingly likely, 
qualified Republican candidates 
may pass on a run for the Oval 
Office.
Manchin 
should 
seriously 
consider making a bid for the 
White House. If he does, every 
American should turn out and vote 
for a leader who will put the nation 
first at every turn.

This holiday season, between 
December 24 and December 
31, airlines cancelled 15,000 
flights nationwide. In New 
York City, Broadway shows 
are being cancelled left and 
right, dozens of restaurants 
are closing their doors and the 
recently elected mayor, Eric 
Adams, even cancelled his 
inauguration gala. Though not 
as severe, this soft lockdown 
feels reminiscent of the hard 
lockdown in March 2020. 
As a student, there is one 
parallel course of action that 
stands out the most. Schools 
gave 
students 
a 
two-week 
“break” in early 2020 which 
turned into months of virtual 
instruction. I fear a similar 
fate for my education now 
that many universities are 
delaying the date that students 
will come back to campus, 
and opting instead for two 
weeks 
of 
online 
learning. 
Understandably, a two week 
break may be terrifying to 
the student — of any level — 
who has had years of their 
experience 
ripped 
away 
from them. But we must be 
rational, and try our best to 
understand the damage that 
an unmitigated Omicron wave 
could do to our community.
I do not want school to go 
back online. After losing a year 
and a half of my high school 
experience to virtual learning, 
I 
can’t 
imagine 
missing 
anything more. The loss of my 
last year of high school sports, 
the experience of finally being 
a senior and having time with 
my friends before we all went 
our separate ways has made 
me grateful for the college 
life I have experienced thus 

far. As a result, I am less 
willing to let it go. However, 
as colleges across the country 
— both private and public 
— are starting their spring 
semesters online, my feelings 
have become more ambivalent. 
While I have a strong desire to 
go back, the decision to return 
to in-person classes is not that 
simple. 
As a New Yorker, I have seen 
how Omicron has ravaged the 
city. On walks to the nearby 
coffee cart for my daily fix of 
iced coffee, I am surrounded 
by COVID testing lines that 
have taken over every other 
block. Masks are back to 
being glued on faces, as no one 
dares to pull them down, even 
outside. Even my hometown 
friends, who I may not see 
again for months, have taken 
to self-isolating for fear of 
contracting the virus. After 
only two weeks of break, I am 
already aware of the dangers 
that lie in densely populated 
areas and what is at stake if 
the situation is not handled 
properly. As such, I fear what 
is to come of the University of 
Michigan and its population 
of over 48,000 students and 
29,000 employees. 
With 
students 
returning 
from all corners of the country, 
and some from across the 
globe, 
the 
risks 
of 
rapid 
spread are high. Though there 
will be some who remain 
cautious, there will be many 
who won’t; whether it be 
continuing nightly endeavors 
at packed fraternities or simple 
carelessness like forgetting to 
wear a mask in public places, 
chances are high that we will 
be seeing a surge of Omicron 
cases on campus. If it really 
does come to that, we may be 
looking at an entire semester of 
virtual learning. Considering 

this, I would gladly delay the 
gratification of fully in person 
classes if it means we will 
minimize the amount of time 
that we will be forced online.
So, if the spread of Omicron is 
this serious and many colleges 
have already shut down for a 
week or two, why haven’t we? 
Without the notifications that 
used to inform us of positive 
COVID cases in classrooms, 
what are we left with? The 
requirement 
that 
students 
and faculty receive booster 
shots, 
the 
easily 
avoidable 
ResponsiBlue screening checks 
along with the University’s 
arguably 
lackluster 
contact 
tracing program and isolation 
policies will likely be hard-
pressed to protect our campus 
community from COVID-19. 
As such, it is the University’s 
responsibility to do more. 
Possible solutions include 
mandating 
regular 
COVID 
testing 
— 
even 
for 
fully 
vaccinated students on campus 
— as is the norm at several peer 
colleges and universities across 
the country. The University 
should also consider resuming 
communication about positive 
cases 
across 
campus, 
or 
even 
temporarily

The best course of action

we should be cognizant of the 
fact there are scores of other 
actions outside of a full virtual

could take to make campus

so far the University has 
adopted 
worryingly 
few 
of

COVID-19: Episode 2 – Omicron Strikes Back

PALAK SRIVASTAVA

Social media has a funny way 
of clouding our perceptions of 
ourselves. Being barraged with 
everyone else’s perfected versions 
of their lives, at least for me, 
makes it incredibly difficult to 
resist comparing and scrutinizing 
myself against others. This is my 
beef with Instagays. Instagays, 
attractive gay men on Instagram 
who have followings that surpass 
the tens of thousands, are an 
established facet of the culture 
of gay men. Surpassing the 
occasional thirst trap, these men 
post pictures that are aspirational, 
aesthetic, seductive and fine-
tuned to take full advantage of 
social media algorithms. 
Each time an Instagay comes 
across 
my 
feed 
during 
my 
social media scrolls, a cognitive 
dissonance arises within me. On 
the one hand, they elicit my desire. 
On the other hand, they deflate my 
self-esteem because I will never 
measure up to their good looks and 
immaculate lifestyle. Instagays 
obscure the perceptions of how 
gay men see themselves and what 

they expect the appearances of 
other gay men to be. There needs 
to be a wider recognition that gay 
men with rippling abs who party 
every weekend are a minority, 
rather than the majority, in the gay 
community. This understanding 
would help elevate the self-esteem 
of many gay men and recalibrate 
the expectations that we gay men 
have for each other.
Instagram 
is 
a 
notorious 
enemy of self-worth. This app’s 
image-based interface makes it 
easy to see attractive influencers 
flaunting excessively glamorous 
lifestyles within a few taps. 
Facebook is aware that Instagram 
is taking a toll on the mental health 
of its users. According to insider 
research at Facebook, “Thirty-
two percent of teen girls said that 
when they felt bad about their 
bodies, Instagram made them feel 
worse.” Instagram creates a self-
esteem addiction fueled by likes 
and followers. 
The app’s potent effect on 
mental health is all the more 
worrisome 
when 
looking 
at 
Instagays. And, the LGBTQ+ 
community 
historically 
has 
higher rates of mental illness, 
especially depression and anxiety. 

These elevated rates of mental 
illness, combined with an app 
that is chock full of chiseled 
gay men living it up in the party 
capitals of the world, are a recipe 
for the destruction of gay male 
self-esteem. With a history of 
anxiety and confidence issues, 
I myself have fallen victim to 
late night social media scrolls 
that turn into self-loathing pity 
parties. Sometimes seeing a fellow 
gay man who is seemingly the 
most attractive, successful man 
who has ever existed triggers 
depreciative thoughts that make 
me feel lonely and defeated.
Social media is not an accurate 
representation of reality. Read 
that last sentence over again 
until it truly sinks in. It’s a piece 
of wisdom we’ve all heard many 
times over, yet many of us still 
fall prey to the lures of that one 
Instagram page that reminds us of 
what we’re not and what we don’t 
have. Instagram is a doctored 
version of reality. It is Photoshop 
on steroids. Social media posts 
highlight all of the high points of 
one’s life and never the lows. 

The danger of Instagays

O
n Nov. 30, a gunman 
walked into Oxford High 
School in Michigan and opened 
fire, killing four and injuring seven 
more. The gunman was only 15 
years old. This shooting came at 
the end of one of the deadliest 
years for gun violence in U.S. 
history, with almost 45,000 gun 
deaths so far. Fighting against 
gun violence is not an easy task, 
yet shootings such as the one 
at Oxford High School show 
that the time for change is long 
overdue. Gun violence is always an 
anomaly — until it hits your own 
community, family or friends.
First, 
it 
is 
important 
to 
understand what gun violence 
means. It is violence in which a 
firearm (pistol, shotgun, assault 
rifle or machine gun) is used in a 
domestic or social setting to harm 
or kill civilians.
Gun violence is a threat looming 
over us that has culminated in one 
of the most horrific public health 
crises. Why? There is a lack of 
transparency and research in gun 
violence data collection. Not only 

is data limited, the background 
check process — which is meant 
to screen for mental health issues 
or other red flags — is glaringly 
deficient.
As passionate advocates of 
bringing transparency to gun 
violence data, we made it our 
mission to carve through the 
opacity and find true answers. 
We sat down with Dr. Marc 
Zimmerman, 
professor 
of 
public health at the University 
of Michigan and co-director of 
University of Michigan’s Institute 
for Firearm Injury Prevention, 
to hear about what he and the 
University are doing to effect 
change. 
A young soul from the Jersey 
Shore, Zimmerman immediately 
showed a keen interest in our 
passion to create transparency 
and awareness for gun violence 
prevention. He has been doing 
work on youth gun violence 
protection for over 30 years. Five 
years ago, he submitted a proposal 
to the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) for funding 
for teenage gun violence research 
and subsequently received $6 
million in grant funds “to advance 
youth firearm violence prevention 
research.” 

Zimmerman pointed out the 
role of demographics in the issue 
of gun violence. Sixty percent of all 
firearm deaths are suicide, most in 
rural areas, and mostly by white 
men over the age of 50. This data 
begins to introduce the necessity 
for us to change the narrative to 
protecting mental health instead 
of blaming gun violence on mental 
health. 
This is Zimmerman’s goal. 
Occasional national stories of mass 
shootings increase stigmas about 
people with mental illness, when 
in reality, shootings are a daily 
occurrence. They are a result of the 
lack of mental health background 
checks, medical intervention and 
money for research. Zimmerman 
is bridging this knowledge gap 
and bringing clarity to the youth 
epidemic of gun violence. For 
Zimmerman and us, anti–gun 
violence efforts are not about 
taking away the 330 million guns 
in America, but teaching safer gun 
ownership and ensuring stronger 
background checks. It is a public 
health effort specifically poised at 
saving lives. 
To 
protect 
Americans, 
we 
need more data on how and why 
gun deaths occur. This data 
will lead us to solutions that 

can be implemented to protect 
youths, make gun usage safer and 
provide transparent information 
to our government and medical 
professionals.
Doctors are our first line 
of 
defense. 
According 
to 
Zimmerman, right now, doctors 
lack training on how to have a 
conversation with their patients 
about guns — including safe 
storage and maintaining strong 
mental health. When you walk 
into your doctor’s office, you’re 
asked if you use a seatbelt, if you 
wear a helmet and if you drink 
and drive. Similarly, you should be 
asked if your gun is locked in a safe 
location in your home. 
Dr. Patrick Carter, a colleague 
of Zimmerman’s and co-director 
of the Institute for Firearm Injury 
Prevention, found that less than 
5% of older adult firearm owners 
discuss safe storage with their 
physician even though older adult 
suicides account for more than 
30% of all firearm fatalities. There 
is a disconnect between the data 
provided and the practices within 
medical offices to prevent suicidal 
deaths. More funding is required 
to train doctors on how to ask 
patients 
meaningful 
questions 
related to firearm safety. Firearm 

injury prevention starts with a 
conversation with a healthcare 
professional.
With more funding and training, 
we can give doctors the power to 
limit the number of gun deaths. 
Students and teachers are also able 
to change the conversation and 
stigmas around mental health and 
gun violence. Nobody understands 
this more than Linda Beigel 
Schulman. Mother of Scott Beigel, 
a heroic teacher who sacrificed 
his life defending his students 
during the Parkland shooting of 
2018. Linda has worked tirelessly 
to push for policies such as red 
flag laws at a national level and 
has become a leader in preventing 
further gun violence. Red flag 
laws allow officials to temporarily 
remove a firearm from those who 
present a danger to themselves 
and others. This law could prevent 
shootings like these in the future. 
19 states and Washington, D.C., 
have already enacted this law. 
Michigan has yet to pass it.
Schulman 
spends 
her 
days speaking with students, 
community leaders and advocates 
about her son’s story. By sharing 
her story with young people, she 
is trying to open the conversation 
and prevent another shooting. 

Zimmerman 
and 
Schulman 
understand the importance of 
mobilizing a population against 
teenage violence and cutting to the 
root causes.
For the first time in the past 
20 years, the CDC and National 
Institutes of Health (NIH) have 
recognized gun violence as a 
public health crisis and have thus 
begun to award institutions, such 
as Michigan’s Firearm Injury 
Prevention Institute, funding. We 
need to keep this conversation 
moving forward, and to do so 
involves you.
Red flag laws are just one 
policy that you can help advocate 
in the state of Michigan by 
writing a letter or calling your 
state representative. Increasing 
mental health background checks 
is another issue that requires 
attention and advocacy to increase 
the conversation of gun safety 
in medical practices. From the 
lack of funding for data on gun-
related fatalities to the necessary 
mental health focus that should be 
enforced in background checks to 
facilitating conversations within 
medical practices, there are many 
areas to leave an impact. It starts 
with having a conversation with 
your peers.

A

s Martin Luther King Jr. 
Day approaches on January 
17, we must remember his 
dream that one day people of every 
race would be treated as equals. In his 
“I Have a Dream” speech, he famously 
urges his listeners to fight for their 
equality with peaceful protest rather 
than with violence.
Despite the fact that this speech was 
delivered over half a century ago, in 
1963, and was one of the most poignant 
and influential moments in U.S. history, 
his dream of racial equality has yet 
to be fulfilled. To ask for the idea of 
racial equality to be upheld is not an 
exorbitant demand; the current state of 
our nation, however, suggests that this 
demand may have required more than 
King expected.
Though MLK Day is recognized as 
a federal holiday, Robert E. Lee Day is 
recognized as a state holiday in several 
southern states. The precise date of this 
holiday varies by state but often falls 
on the third Monday of January each 
year, as does MLK Day. Lawmakers’ 
justification for this dual holiday is the 
inconvenience of having two separate 
holidays in January. In Alabama in 
particular, the celebration of Lee is 
even grander than that of King. 
The antithesis of these two historical 
figures is notable, with one being a 
former Confederate general who fought 
for the rights of white slave owners to 
own Black people and the other being a 
civil rights leader who lobbied tirelessly 
for equal rights. The celebration of a 
man who owned almost 200 slaves, who 
fought against our nation’s foundations 
of racial equality and who was indicted 
for treason for attempting to divide the 
country, is disgusting, especially when 
it is seemingly designed to undermine 
the celebration of his exact opposite.
Even if Robert E. Lee Day were 
celebrated on a different date than 
MLK Day, it would remain a major 
issue. Its celebration exemplifies how 

the Confederacy has remained an 
influential and revered part of history 
for many Americans. The Confederacy’s 
persistence is further displayed in 
the many United States citizens who 
still proudly wave the Confederate 
flag today. While those who fly this 
flag may justify it on the grounds of 
Southern pride, it undoubtedly still 
carries the weight of racism and white 
supremacy. The continuing veneration 
of the Confederacy is just one of many 
examples of the racial inequality that 
still pervades our nation today. 
While Dr. King proudly advocated 
for rooting out racism, many people 
seem to have forgotten MLK’s message 
of the virtues of peaceful protest. While 
the vast majority, 93%, of 2020’s Black 
Lives Matter protests were peaceful, 
the other 7% resulted in nine people 
dying and over $1 billion of property 
damage. However, it is arguable that 
these violent riots are truly what 
opened the eyes of many. 
It’s easy to view this violence as an 
unacceptable repudiation of MLK’s 
message, a betrayal of the ideals that 
inspired the Civil Rights Act in favor 
of senseless violence. However, to 
hold this view would be to ignore the 
observations, and consequent changes 
of belief, that King made later in life. 
Toward the end of his lifetime, King’s 
popularity waned. He was abandoned 
by many of his white, moderate 
supporters and expressed the fear that 
white moderates might be a greater 
enemy to him than radicals due to their 
desire for order. These were the same 
individuals that King excoriated in his 
“Letter From a Birmingham Jail” for 
preferring an “absence of tension” to 
the “presence of justice.”
This attitude explains a speech he 
gave right here in Michigan just three 
weeks before his assassination, titled 
“The Other America.” In this speech, he 
denounces the lack of improvements in 
standard of living for Black Americans 
in the previous years, despite gaining 
greater legal rights, and seemingly 
addresses those who would denounce 
riots as antithetical to his vision with 

the phrase “a riot is the language of the 
unheard.” Essentially, while he finds it 
regrettable that riots continue to occur, 
he recognizes that to condemn them 
without first eliminating the injustice 
that causes them is hypocritical and 
ultimately futile.
It seems that the day King dreamed 
of was further off than he may have 
thought, and, even if conditions had 
changed radically in the months 
following this speech, his assassination 
a short time later means that he would 
never have been able to see it. The fact 
that nearly 54 years later his dream 
has still not been fulfilled has led many 
to lose hope. This is a mistake. Our 
generation is more socially aware than 
any generation thus far. While we may 
not have the capacity to change the 
current state of affairs right now, we do 
have the power to teach our children the 
ideals of racial equality. Our children 
can then pass these values to their own 
children. This will eventually lead us to 
a permanent escape from the society of 
inequality we live in; we may even see 
this change during our lifetime.
The issue of racial inequality is wide 
ranging and multifaceted, so much so 
that I have barely scraped the surface 
of it. Rather than taking the day off of 
classes to relax on Jan. 17, I encourage 
you to really think about why we 
have this day off. Reread King’s most 
famous speech, “I Have A Dream,” and 
appreciate not only his rhetoric but the 
goal he had in mind. 
After taking time to understand his 
message, I ask that you consider how 
you will spread it. At any instance of 
injustice, we cannot hesitate to speak 
up, we must take efforts in extending 
this message to our friends, family and 
other relations. 
Our 
generation, 
especially 
Michigan’s leaders and best, has the 
capacity to make King’s dream come 
true. In doing this, we are making the 
dream of millions of other oppressed 
people come true as well. When this day 
finally comes, I am sure Martin Luther 
King Jr. will be smiling from afar.

Martin Luther King Jr.’s dream is yet to be fulfilled

Early 3-point shooting crucial in 
dominating win over Rutgers

Driving into the lane, senior 
forward Naz Hillmon kicked 
the ball out to senior guard 
Amy Dilk on the baseline. 
Catching, ready to shoot, Dilk 
fired up a 3-pointer, draining 
her first three since returning 
from a lower leg injury that she 
suffered in the first game of the 
season.
In 
the 
No. 
8 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team’s 
matchup with Rutgers, sound 
3-point 
shooting 
buried 
the 
Scarlet 
Knights 
early, 
sustaining a lead the Wolverines 
would never relinquish.
The three from Dilk was just 
the beginning of a first half 
attack from behind the arc. In 
the subsequent offensive play, 
senior wing Leigha Brown 
knocked down a three from 
the top of the key. The back-
to-back 
3-pointers 
capped 
off a 12-0 run to end the first 
quarter.
Opening the second quarter, 
the Wolverines stayed hot from 
behind the arc. Junior guard 
Maddie Nolan buried a three 
from the wing to start the 
quarter. Nolan would go on to 
finish the game 4-for-4 from 
three, ending with 14 points.
“I would take Maddie up 
against anyone in the conference 
shooting-wise,” 
Brown 
said. 
“I think she’s one of our best 
shooters.”
Continuing the hot streak, 
senior forward Emily Kiser also 
flashed her extended range with 
a three from the corner. Brown 
knocked down another three late 
into the third quarter. In total, 
four players contributed from 
behind the 3-point line, tying for 

the most in a single game so far 
this season.
Michigan’s 
diverse 
3-point 
attack throws a wrinkle into 
opposing 
teams’ 
defensive 
scheme. Keeping extra defenders 
out of the paint frees up Hillmon 
to work in the post and opens 
driving 
lanes 
for 
Wolverine 
guards. 
“We have a lot of depth in the 
guard position,” Brown said. 
“And a lot of people that do 
different things, whether that’s 
shooters coming off the bench, 
Amy coming out trying to create 
just as good as anyone. Our 
ability and the versatility that we 
have with that position. … I think 
that it’s really important to have 
that. A lot of teams don’t really 
have six or seven guards deep 
that can play so that’s definitely 
huge.”
Coming out of the locker 
room, the relentless barrage 
quieted down in the second half. 
Michigan only had one 3-pointer 
the rest of the game. Yet there 
was no need for more.
As the clock ticked down on 
a game Rutgers had no hope of 
winning, the Wolverines’ second 

quarter storm of raining threes 
had already dashed the Scarlet 
Knights’ hopes. Michigan ended 
the game shooting 60% from 
three — and with a season high 
nine 3-pointers.
“Maddie Nolan is such an 
unbelievable shooter, and she 
made some great shots but 
Leigha Brown really made them 
tonight too,” Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico. “And it was 
great to see Emily Kiser make 
one as well.”
If Michigan can sustain this 
level 
of 
shooting, 
alongside 
Hillmon and Kiser in the post, 
the Wolverines could have a deep 
offensive rotation that keeps 
opposing teams on their toes. 
The combination will be needed 
as Michigan still looks ahead 
to the remainder of a strong 
conference schedule. As the No. 8 
team in the country for the first 
time ever, the Wolverines have a 
new target on their back.
“We’re in a position where 
people are coming for us on any 
given night,” Barnes Arico said. 
“We’re seeing everybody’s best 
shot. So we have to bring our best 
game and we can’t have lapses.”

Michigan defeats Georgia in highest scoring season opener 
in program history

With the first routine of 
the season, sophomore Reyna 
Guggino raced down the vault 
runway and soared into her 
Yurchenko one and a half. She 
landed on the ground as the 
crowd, including a full student 
section, roared, her feet staying 
still to complete a stuck vault. 
Guggino’s 
vault 
scored 
a 
9.900 and set the tone for the 
rest of the gymnastics meet on 
Thursday as No. 1 Michigan 
(1-0) defeated No. 15 Georgia 
(0-1) in its first meet of the 2022 
season 
197.750-194.500. 
The 
Wolverines ultimately won the 
meet by over 3 points and earned 
the highest score in program 
history for a season opener. 
The meet also marked the 
first time fans were allowed to 
watch in person in the Crisler 
Center since COVID-19 shut 
down the 2020 season. 
“It 
was 
amazing 
to 
have 
everyone in here,” senior Natalie 
Wojcik 
said. 
“Everyone 
was 
super 
involved, 
cheering 
the 

whole time and participating in 
all our little traditions that we 
have throughout. And the student 
section was completely filled, so it 
was really cool to see their support 
and just to be here back with our 
families and all of our friends.”
Following 
Guggino’s 
first 
vault, the rest of the vault 
rotation also delivered high-
scoring routines, highlighted 
by 9.900s from senior Abby 
Heiskell 
and 
junior 
Sierra 
Brooks. Every gymnast in the 
rotation completed a Yurchenko 
one and a half, which gave them 
an extra boost in their scoring, 
since the vault allows for a start 
value of 10.0.
“In 
order 
for 
(the 
more 
difficult vault) to be a benefit, not 
only do you have to do them, you 
have to do them well,” Michigan 
coach Bev Plocki said. “Because 
if you do it and you don’t do them 
well, it will probably be a bigger 
deduction. But if you do them 
well… in theory it gives you a 
tenth, tenth and a half edge over 
someone else.”
As the Wolverines completed 
their 
vault 
rotation, 
the 
Bulldogs struggled on bars, 

giving Michigan a full point lead 
moving into the second rotation. 
The 
Wolverines 
continued 
their strong performance onto 
the bars, led by a 9.950 from 
Wojcik and a 9.925 from Brooks. 
Meanwhile, Georgia suffered 
another rough rotation on the 
vault with a fall. Michigan 
gained a 98.900-97.525 lead 
halfway through the meet. 
The Wolverines continued to 
increase their lead with a set 
of solid routines on the beam. 
Wojcik and Heiskell both stuck 
their dismounts, earning a 9.950 
and a 9.925. When Heiskell 
finished her routine, she ran 
directly 
to 
assistant 
coach 
Maile’ana Kanewa-Hermelyn — 
who leads the coaching efforts 
for beam — to embrace her. The 
event has been a steady force for 
the team and was instrumental 
in its national championship 
title last season.
“Maile has been amazing,” 
Plocki said. “Our staff is amazing, 
we complement each other so 
well. Scott and I both have more 
experience, which comes with 
age, but she’s been such a great 
infusion of young energy and some 

new ideas. And she choreographed 
all of our floor routines, which I 
think are spectacular.”
Michigan’s 
floor 
routines 
did not disappoint in the final 
rotation, 
where 
the 
team 
clinched the win. Junior Gabby 
Wilson closed out the meet with 
the highest scoring routine, 
earning a 9.950. Sophomore 
Naomi Morrison also assisted 
on the floor and throughout the 
rest of the competition, as she 
competed in her first all-around 
effort for the Wolverines. 
“(Competing 
in 
the 
all-
around) gives me a confidence 
boost,” Morrison said. “I just 
want to be a steady force for this 
team, and I really want to put 
up scores for them and help our 
team succeed, and hopefully win 
a national championship again.”
Michigan’s 
performance 
secured 
the 
win 
against 
Georgia, but also proved why 
it is the top ranked team going 
into the season. Its score of 
197.750 was the highest for 
any team in the NCAA this 
weekend, as well as the highest-
scoring season opener for the 
Wolverines in program history.

TESS CROWLEY/Daily 

The defending National Champions, Michigan, had a strong start to the 

2022 season.

JEREMY WEINE/Daily 

Michigan’s victory over Rutgers was propelled by its success from 
beyond the arc

While 
much 
of 
No. 
6 
Michigan’s core was away at the 
World Junior Championships, 
sophomore forward Brendan 
Brisson stayed with the team. At 
twenty years old, he was too old 
to make the cut. 
But after scoring two goals 
against No. 10 Massachusetts on 
Saturday night, he showed his 
continued influence on how the 
Wolverines perform as a whole. 
In Sunday’s final game to 
complete a sweep over the 
Minutemen, 
Brisson 
was 
electric 
from 
the 
get-go. 
Whether it was sticking up 
for 
sophomore 
goaltender 
Erik Portillo, rushing back on 
defense or firing shots on net, 

his presence was immense. 
Brisson’s 
forecheck 
and 
backtrack aided his line in 
dominating the Massachusetts 
defense.
“A lot of our chances in the line 
came off turnovers,” sophomore 
forward 
Matty 
Beniers 
said. 
“Forecheck and getting pucks 
back 
is 
huge 
for 
our 
line. 
We’re great with the puck, but 
sometimes it’s harder for skilled 
guys to get the puck back. We did 
that great this weekend.”
In the final minute of the 
first period, Brisson picked up 
a loose puck deflected off the 
Minutemen’s 
goaltender 
and 
buried it for the opening goal. 
This wasn’t the only time his 
name would be blasted over the 
arena speakers; Brisson’s work 
continued after the break, sliding 
the puck to a wide open Beniers 

and giving Michigan a 2-0 lead. 
“He’s a sniper and one of the 
bigger goal scorers I’ve been 
around for 40 years of college 
hockey,” Michigan coach Mel 
Pearson said. “Anywhere near 
him he’s got an idea how to finish. 
The puck follows him. The puck 
comes to him.”
Brisson’s defensive work also 
strengthened the Wolverines as 
a whole and gave them the edge. 
During a Michigan powerplay, a 
Massachusetts skater drove up the 
right wing; Brisson blocked his shot 
and didn’t let him get near Portillo. 
The Wolverines regained possession 
and took advantage of their extra 
man by tiring out the opposition and 
bombarding them with shots.
Brisson was still hungry in 
the third, earning four shots. 
In the final moments when the 
Minutemen 
had 
scavenged 
a 

goal, Michigan continued to find 
Brisson to design plays. He now 
leads the team with 14 goals, three 
behind Western Michigan forward 
Ethen Frank, the nation’s leader.
His influence was seen in all 
aspects of Sunday’s matchup. 
When a scuffle starts on the ice, 
Brisson is likely to be in the thick 
of it. By the end of the second 
period, he had spent 4 minutes in 
the penalty box. Brisson’s ability 
to get in the opponent’s head 
and win the psychological game 
is an underappreciated skill — 
which he displayed on numerous 
occasions on the night. 
“He’s starting to play with more 
pace,” Pearson said. “I didn’t like 
his penalties tonight. He’s got to 
play with a little more emotional 
control. And that’s good because 
he’s getting his hands dirty. It’s 
just not the goal now.”

Brisson’s days in a Michigan 
uniform will likely come to an 
end when the season concludes, 
but it’s clear his respect and skill 
within the group will have a 
lasting effect. Opposing teams 

tend to have a tough day on the 
ice when Brisson is present — and 
they can expect it to continue 
when they play the Wolverines.
At least until the end of the 
season.

Brisson powers Michigan in sweep of Massachusetts

Brisson guides Michigan to weekend sweep over Massachusetts

Less than eight 
hours 
before 
tip-off, 
it 
was 
announced 
that 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 
team 
would 
not play No. 10 
Michigan 
State 
on Saturday due 
to 
COVID-19 
concerns 
within 
the 
Wolverines’ 
program. 
After 
being 
tested 
on 
Friday, the team fell below 
the Big Ten minimum of seven 
available scholarship players.
Unsurprisingly, 24 hours 
later, 
it 
was 
revealed 
that 
Michigan 
wouldn’t 
meet 
the 
threshold 
on 
Tuesday and would also 
forgo its matchup against 
No. 3 Purdue. With each 
unscheduled day off the 
court, 
Michigan 
coach 
Juwan Howard is losing 
his most fleeting resource: 
time. 
After four unranked non-
conference 
losses, 
Howard 
has repeatedly stated that his 
players have what it takes to 
turn it around — even when 
the number of those players 
available 
to 
compete 
has 
begun to dwindle.
“It’s so easy to try and point 
out like, ‘What’s missing?’ ” 
Howard said after Tuesday’s 
loss to unranked Rutgers. “ 
‘No leadership, no shooting, 
no defense.’ I have so much 
positive — I see so many great 
things.”
Now, the potential Howard 
sees will have to wait until 

at least Jan. 14, when 
the 
Wolverines 
are 
scheduled to play Illinois 
in Champaign. 
But 
Howard 
is 
familiar with COVID-
related 
challenges. 
Last season, COVID-
19 was always a factor, 
whether it was looming 
as a constant threat or a 
present danger. 
Most notably, Howard 
and his team weathered a two-
week athletic pause extending 
from the end of January to the 
middle of February last year. 
As 
COVID-19 
transitioned 
from a novelty to a constant 
reality, there came to be an 
expectation of what a team 
would look like after a COVID-
19 pause: off on its shooting, 
sloppy in its defense, generally 
sluggish from being locked out 
of the gym in the middle of the 
season. 
So, naturally, there were 
concerns that the pause would 
hamper a season that was off 
to a stellar start.
“Well, there were some 
turnovers 
being 
made,” 
Howard 
told 
reporters 
after the first practice post-
COVID-19 pause last season. 
“Some 
excessive 
fouling. 
Some wobbly legs. All that is 
expected when you haven’t 
been able to work out, play 
basketball, been sitting in your 
apartments, studying, having 
Zoom calls with professors 
and tutors, haven’t been able 
to get in the gym. When you 
have a layoff like that, you’re 
gonna have some rust. Gonna 
be winded.” 

But the Wolverines didn’t 
lose an ounce of momentum. 
Michigan shook off the rust 
with 
a 
road 
win 
against 
Wisconsin, a performance that 
snowballed into a five-game 
win streak. In just his second 
season in Ann Arbor, Howard 
proved himself not just as a 
coach that could shape talent 
but one that could withstand 
adversity. 
Of course, there are very 
few resemblances between 
this season and last. Last 
season, the Wolverines went 
into the COVID-19 pause 
with a 13-1 record and a No. 
4 ranking. After the first 
half of this season, Michigan 
is solidly unranked with a 
firmly mediocre record of 
7-6. 

Potentially 
more 

importantly, 
last 
year’s 
pause 
was 
athletic-
department-wide, a result 
of COVID-19 outbreaks in 
other programs. While this 
year’s break will likely be 
shorter, there’s a difference 
between getting players back 
in shape after they’ve been 
sitting in their apartments 
versus bringing players back 
after 
potentially 
having 
COVID-19.
And, there’s a difference 
between facing a pause while 
trying to keep a team at the top 
of its game and trying to revive 
a team that’s limping through 
conference play. 
The question of how big 
that 
difference 
is 
— 
and 
whether Howard has what it 
takes to overcome it — will 
have to wait.

Sports Wednesday: 
Canceled games put one more hole 
in the sinking ship

F

ollowing 
the 
regular 
season 
and 
conference 
tournaments, the NCAA 
deploys 
PairWise, 
a 
mathematical 
ranking 
system, 
to seed its postseason hockey 
tournament. Facing the defending 
NCAA National Champions, the No. 
6 Michigan hockey team received a 
prime chance to boost its PairWise 
rankings entering the second half 
of the season. 
On Sunday, it was clear that the 
Wolverines understood the stakes. 
Michigan (16-6-1 overall, 7-5 Big 
Ten) fired on all cylinders, defeating 
No. 10 Massachusetts (10-6-2), 4-2, 
for a pivotal series sweep. 
“If you’re a competitor and you’re 
a player, you want to play in these 
big games,” Michigan coach Mel 
Pearson said. “… I thought our 
players were dialed in, I give them 

a lot of credit.”
Both teams’ forceful backchecks 
highlighted much of the first period. 
Michigan and Massachusetts made 
plenty of entries into its offensive 
zones, only to be swarmed by 
defending skaters who consistently 
broke up odd-man rushes. 
Yet, as the game wore on, the 
Minutemen’s backcheck weakened 
while the Wolverines’ held strong. 
The development ultimately gave 
Michigan the edge, as crisp passes 
and clean zone entries dislocated 
and overwhelmed Massachusetts 
defenders, guiding the Wolverines 
to a comfortable 3-0 lead by the end 
of the second period. 
“All week, we did a great job just 
preparing for what they were going 
to bring,” senior defenseman Nick 
Blankenburg said. “At the end of 
the day, every guy on this team laid 
it all on the line this weekend. … 
Everyone played for each other and 
everyone played the right way.” 
Nearly 
midway 
through 
the 
first period, Portillo corralled a 

shot 
from 
Minutemen 
forward 
Ryan Sullivan into his pads, and as 
Massachusetts skaters whacked at 
him to dislodge the puck, officials 
declared the puck frozen and a 
scuffle ensued. 
As referees cleared the scene, the 
puck sat harmlessly in the middle 
of the crease. Portillo kept the puck 
out of harm’s way throughout the 
contest, totaling 28 saves in another 
strong showing. 
On the other end, with less than 
a minute left in the first period, the 
Minutemen made their first costly 
defensive error.
Sophomore 
forward 
Matty 
Beniers took the puck behind 
the left post, and Massachusetts 
goaltender Matt Murray easily 
poked 
the 
difficult-angle 
shot 
away with his stick. The puck 
slid towards a conglomeration of 
skaters left of the crease, but no one 
was able to control it as sophomore 
forward Brendan Brisson skated in 
from across the ice, snapping it past 
Murray. 

The momentum carried over 
into the second period, where 
Massachusetts saw its chances 
dwindle by the minute. 
Michigan 
dominated 
the 
Minutemen’s power play over the 
first two minutes, and less than 
four minutes into the period, 
the 
Wolverines 
struck 
again. 
Sophomore forward Kent Johnson 
speedily 
entered 
the 
attacking 
third without a contest, finding 
Brisson in the slot. Brisson shifted 
to his left before finding Beniers 
on the right side for a raucous one-
timer goal. 
“I think it was a result of us just 
working harder than they were,” 
Beniers said. “They were working 
really hard, they played a good 
game, but I think we were just a 
little bit better than them.”
Throughout 
the 
first 
seven 
minutes of the second period, the 
puck practically lived in Michigan’s 
offensive zone, and the Wolverines 
seized 
control 
of 
the 
game. 
Michigan outshot Massachusetts, 

7-3, in that span and didn’t look 
back. 
While the Wolverines remained 
in command, freshman forward 
Dylan 
Duke 
added 
insurance. 
Securing his own rebound following 
a pad save from Murray, Duke 
launched the puck over Murray’s 
right pad for Michigan’s third goal.
A 
shorthanded 
goal 
by 
Massachusetts 
forward 
Bobby 
Trivigno with six minutes left in 
the third period couldn’t derail the 
Wolverines, and junior forward 
Johnny Beecher’s second empty-
net goal of the weekend sealed the 
deal.
With the Big Ten standings 
tight and the conference schedule 
returning to full-swing, Michigan 
enters its final stretch with much-
needed momentum and another 
signature victory to add to its 
resume. 
“The gang’s all back together,” 
Pearson said. “… Just really proud 
of our team.”
