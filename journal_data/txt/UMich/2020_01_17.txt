U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, 
D-Mich., held a community 
meeting Thursday evening 
at 
Washtenaw 
County 
Learning Resource Center 
to discuss potential action 
to stop the spread of the 
Gelman Plume, a plume of 
toxic 
chemical 
pollution 
currently running through 
Ann Arbor’s groundwater. 
Dingell 
spoke 
at 
the 
event 
alongside 
officials 
from 
the 
Environmental 
Protection Agency, Michigan 

Department of Environment, 
Great Lakes & Energy and the 
Michigan Attorney General’s 
Office. Approximately 150 
community 
members 
and 
City 
Council 
members 
attended the event. 
At the meeting, community 
members 
asked 
questions 
and discussed ideas with 
the officials, who expressed 
a commitment to stopping 
the spread of the plume. 
Dingell told The Daily the 
goal of the meeting was to 
bring relevant government 
agencies together to discuss 
how 
best 
to 
solve 
the 
problem. 

“The 
Gelman 
dioxane 
plume has been a problem 
in Washtenaw County for 
far too long,” Dingell said. 
“As 
local 
leaders 
work 
towards 
consensus 
on 
a 
solution, it is essential that 
we 
have 
all 
responsible 
government agencies at the 
table 
to 
publicly 
answer 
questions about the current 
situation 
and 
options 
moving forward. That is 
why I convened this meeting 
with representatives from 
the EPA, EGLE, and the 
Michigan Attorney General’s 
offices. It is important that 
everyone 
comes 
together 

in the same room to have 
a productive conversation 
and be rowing in the same 
direction about how to best 
move forward.”
The 
event 
began 
with 
Jason Morgan, chair of the 
Washtenaw County Board 
of Commissioners. Morgan 
asked pre-planned questions 
from community members 
to the officials on the panel. 
The 
first 
question 
was 
directed towards the EPA 
and EGLE about their efforts 
to address the issue. 

Approximately 15 students 
and 
faculty 
gathered 
in 
North 
Quad 
Thursday 
afternoon 
to 
hear 
Jenny 
Radesky, 
Medical 
School 
assistant 
professor, 
share 
her research on the effects of 
technology and media usage 
on child development.
Radesky, who received her 
M.D. at Harvard Medical 
School, 
specializes 
in 
developmental 
behavioral 
pediatrics. She has trained at 
Seattle Children’s Hospital 
and Boston Medical Center.
Radesky began her talk 
by discussing her research 
interests 
in 
parental 

influence on their children’s 
use of technology.
“I was interested in how 
media fits into this situation: 
parents’ 
technology 
use 
and child technology use,” 
Radesky said. “I was really 
influenced by the research 
on 
background 
TV 
and 
parent-child interaction.”
Radesky said she chose 
to study mobile technology 
as opposed to traditional 
technology because it has 
been studied much less and 
she was curious about its 
effects. She said she wanted 
to know what happens when 
media is in your pocket.
Scott 
Campbell, 
Communication and Media 
professor, 
moderated 
the 
event. He said he chose 

to 
showcase 
her 
work 
because it is unique to her 
department 
and 
impacts 
many community members.
“I chose to host (Radesky) 
because of a mixture of her 
scholarship that fits with 
what we have going on,” 
Campbell said. “But there is 
also an applied aspect of her 
work that we don’t always 
get a chance to benefit from. 
Some of us are parents and 
very curious about the work 
that she does and how she 
does it.”
Through 
observational 
studies, 
Radesky 
found 
that 75 percent of families 
used a device during meal 
times and and tended to 
have less interaction among 
family members. Radesky 

noted 
this 
observational 
study was not about making 
conclusions, 
but 
instead 
to learn more about what 
specifically she wanted to 
study.
After 
much 
trial 
and 
error, Radesky landed on an 
application called Moment 
which tracks a participant’s 
phone 
usage. 
Specifically, 
it tracks when an app is 
opened or closed. Her sample 
consisted of Android and 
Apple users. 
Radesky found children 
used YouTube for at least one 
hour each day, which she said 
she wants to study further.

Beginning 
Friday 
morning, 
community members can start 
taking 
classes 
at 
Michigan’s 
first-ever SoulCycle. The studio 
is located on South University 
Avenue near Espresso Royale.
Classes are expected to run at 
least 29 times during the week and 
new bookings are available every 
Monday at noon. Prices, packages 
and schedules can be found on 
their website. 
Briana Krull, studio manager 
of SoulCycle Ann Arbor, said she’s 
excited to introduce the Ann Arbor 
community to this new experience, 
which features choreography as a 
way to obtain a full-body workout. 
Unlike other workouts focusing on 
competition, Krull said SoulCycle 
is focused on the individual’s goals.
“A lot of workouts these days 
are quantified with metrics,” Krull 
said. “SoulCycle doesn’t really 
have a competitive aspect, it’s 
more about tuning into your body. 
You’re supposed to match the beat 
of the music that you’re riding with 
your pedal strokes, and you also 
ride with your pack.” 
Krull said the setup of the room 
is supposed to help members focus 
on doing the best of their ability.
“We’ll have the bikes close 

Professor 
of 
management 
and organizations Robert E. 
Quinn, co-founder of the Center 
for 
Positive 
Organizations, 
spoke to about 100 students and 
educators about bringing out the 
best in employees and students 
on Thursday afternoon at the 
Ross School of Business. The 
talk focused on how authentic 
group discussions are the most 
constructive way to create a 
better work environment. 
The lecture centered on the 
analogy of turning horses into 
unicorns, which Quinn used to 
mean turning good employees 
and students into great ones. 
“This is the central question 
that I want to lay out: how can 
… leaders and others turn horses 
into unicorns?” Quinn said. 
“The real question is, how do 
you turn an ordinary company 
into a great company.” 
Quinn 
then 
introduced 
a 
colorful pie chart based on a 
balance of virtues and their 
vices. This chart was meant to 
show managers that every action 
has a pro and a con. For example, 
Quinn said encouraging creative 
action could also potentially 
introduce chaos.

This is the third installment of 
a three-part series investigating 
student mental health at the 
University 
of 
Michigan. 
The 
Daily interviewed students on 
campus, 
students 
across 
the 
country and prominent leaders 
of mental health to contribute to 
this series. In part one and part 
two, The Daily examined student-
found complains about CAPS 
and alternative mental health 
resources on campus.
The 
Daily 
previously 
reported 
on 
mental 
health 
services 
and 
alternative 
resources that have emerged 
at the University of Michigan. 
However, student frustrations 
with wellness resources are 
not unique to campus, as many 
universities across the country 
are 
struggling 
to 
provide 
adequate service in response to 
increasing demand. 
The 
Daily 
completed 
an 
analysis of the mental health 
resources at schools comparable 
to the University, finding that 
the University and other schools 
are working together to improve 

these programs.
At Michigan State University, 
wait times for Counseling and 
Psychological 
Services 
are 
typically 
under 
two 
hours. 
The University of California, 
Berkeley offers a vast array of 
mental-health promotion clubs. 
While many universities have 
different resources and ideas for 
improving mental health, U-M 
CAPS Director Todd Sevig said 
the University is a role model 
when it comes to mental health 
at college campuses.
“We’ve had a lot of successes 
at CAPS,” Sevig said. “People 
around the country kind of copy 
what we do.”
Michigan State
Michigan State University’s 
Counseling and Psychological 
Services offer slightly different 
services 
than 
University 
of 
Michigan’s. For example, instead 
of booking appointments in 
advance, they primarily offer 
walk-in appointments for initial 
consultation.
MSU CAPS Director Matt 
Patishnock said their counselors 
try to fit in as many students as 
possible every day to match their 
students’ expectations.

B E HIND THE STORY

Every Friday, Daily staffers will give a behind the scenes look at 
one of this week’s stories. This week, LSA freshman Jasmin Lee 
and sophomore Calder Lewis on their three-part series about 
University mental health services:

“Over break, we interviewed multiple students from all over the 
country who we asked from social media who would be interested in 
talking about our material. We got their opinions about the mental 
health resources at their schools and colleges. We also got U-M 
students talking about CAPS and other resources that they’ve used 
here.”

Jasmin Lee

“The biggest roadblock that we had was figuring out the angle of the 
first story. We started out with a huge, basically 6,000-word piece, 
and we ended up splitting it into three separate stories.”

For generations, the Michigan Union has been a place 
where students lead, a place of activism and a place of 
student-driven change that has made us a better and more 
important University. It’s my hope that the Union encourages 
students from all different backgrounds and academic 
disciplines to interact and take advantage of the outstanding 
breadth and diversity of our great University.”

Faculty panel to set academic 
agenda for presidential debate

2020 theme semester ‘Debate and Democracy’ aims to encourage student civic engagement

JULIA FORREST 
Daily Staff Reporter

The Presidential Debate 
Academic 
Advisory 
Committee, a new faculty 
committee, will create a 
“Democracy 
and 
Debate” 
themed academic semester 
for Fall 2020 ahead of the 
2020 presidential debate. 
The 
committee 
plans 
to 
incorporate 
various 
debate-centered 
academic 
events in all 19 schools and 
colleges 
throughout 
the 
University in order to make 
students 
 
more 
civically 
engaged. Additionally, the 
committee is encouraging 
each 
school 
and 
college 
within the University to host 
discussions, lecture series 
and other programs centered 
around 
the 
debate 
and 
civically engaging topics. 
Angela 
Dillard, 
the 
committee 
chair 
and 
a 
professor of Afroamerican 
and African studies, spoke 
to The Daily about the goals 
and plans of the committee 

and the 2020 semester.
“Ideally, 
the 
theme 
semester 
offerings 
will 
highlight 
the 
U-M 
disciplinary 
and 
interdisciplinary strengths,” 
Dillard said. “The theme 
semester also provides a 
forum for exploration and 
discussion of a range of 
issues at play during the 
2020 election season, from 
health care and economic 
mobility to climate change, 
immigration, education and 
mass incarceration.” 
Dillard 
expressed 
how 
important 
it 
will 
be 
for 
students 
from 
interdisciplinary 
backgrounds to participate 
in the activities.
“In this moment in U.S. 
politics, the most pressing 
issues 
that 
confront 
us 
as a nation are radically 
interdisciplinary,” 
Dillard 
said. 
“Hence, 
solutions 
will need to span academic 
disciplines, 
will 
need 
to 
be responsive to citizens 
and 
other 
members 
of 
communities, will need to 

be grounded in evidence and 
open to inquiry, debate and 
the free exchange of ideas 
in ways that incorporate a 
diversity of opinions and 
lived realities.” 
Another member of the 
committee, Jenna Bednar, 
professor of political science, 
spoke on the committee’s 
efforts to get student input 
on the academic agenda. 
“We’re working with our 
student 
groups 
to 
make 
sure that we are able to 
incorporate as many student 
perspectives 
as 
possible 
into our decision making,” 
Bednar 
said. 
“They’re 
literally at the core of our 
decision-making process.” 
One of the groups the 
committee is working with 
is 
the 
Central 
Student 
Government. Public Policy 
senior and CSG President, 
Ben 
Gerstein, 
is 
one 
of 
the student leaders on the 
core 
committee, 
a 
unit 
of 
the 
PDAAC 
working 
with various departments 
involved with the debate. He 
said students have reacted 

positively to the idea of a 
themed semester. 
“I think it presents a 
unique 
opportunity 
for 
curricula from faculty who 
are putting together this 
with intention and the idea 
of making this an experience 
that not only do our students 
get 
to 
maximize 
their 
ability to experience what’s 
occurring when the debate is 
actually on campus, but have 
some sort of contextualized 
understanding,” 
Gerstein 
said.
Bednar said the committee 
will continue to design and 
prepare the themed semester 
with 
student 
voices 
and 
campus resources in mind. 
“It’s the first time the 
University’s 
hosted 
one 
of these debates, and so I 
hope that students feel a lot 
of pride in hosting and in 
having the world tuned into 
the University of Michigan, 
Ann Arbor,” Bednar said. “I 
hope that it gives (students) 
an opportunity to reflect on 
their own role as a citizen in 
our democracy.”

“As part of our counseling 
services, we offer a same-day 
access for any student for any issue 
every day,” Patishnock said. “On 
any given day, 50 students walk 
in without an appointment and 
they either get a brief consultation 
or routine screening or crisis 
appointment. Then there’s the 
continuity of care expectations 
meaning that the commissions 
here that screen that student will 
keep them here if we can. That’s 
a significant part of our resources 
for students.”
According 
to 
MSU 
CAPS’ 
website, 
initial 
visits 
take 

anywhere from 90 to 120 minutes, 
including paperwork and waiting 
room 
time. 
MSU 
freshman 
Lily 
Callis 
said 
the 
walk-in 
appointments made it easy for her 
to find access to care right away at 
MSU CAPS.
“The walk-in is very helpful 
when someone is having a crisis 
and I think that’s very helpful 
to have on campus,” Callis said. 
“They typically refer a lot of 
students to outside campus help 
since there’s so many students.”
MSU CAPS offers referrals 
to resources outside of its own 
services, 
including 
hospitals, 
therapists and other mental health 
professionals in the East Lansing 
area MSU has staff members 
assign 
students 
with 
these 

resources and ensure they are 
safe. Patishnock said he sees this 
as a solution to the drastic increase 
of students seeking mental health 
services at MSU CAPS in recent 
years. 
“Given the total increase in the 
number of counselors we had, 
we’ve had to refer out a significant 
number of students to the local 
community,” 
Patishnock 
said. 
“We’ve hired a full-time referral 
coordinator and social worker 
who meets with students all day 
long and helps them get connected 
into the community as opposed to 
just giving them information to 
make sure they don’t get lost.”
At the University of Michigan, 
CAPS prefers to keep students 
within their counseling center for 

mental health issues that can be 
solved for short-term counseling. 
The CAPS annual report showed 
more than 73 percent of clients 
attended five or fewer sessions in 
the 2018-19 school year.
Since 
U-M 
CAPS 
is 
not 
designed for long-term mental 
health support, less than 1 percent 
of students receive more than 20 
appointments.
According to Sevig, CAPS has 
one care manager who places 
students with resources outside of 
the organization which they can 
access for long-term use.
“One thing we started — 
and we were the first in the 

CAPS

country to do this — (is) we have a care 
manager,” Sevig said. “So we developed 
one person, and now we have two full-
time people, to help with referrals that 
take a little work.”
Emphasis on referring to East Lansing 
professionals also impacts the goal of 
students visiting MSU CAPS. According 
to The State News, MSU CAPS only offers 
students three free appointments, after 
which appointments must be covered by 
insurance or out of the student’s pocket. 
U-M CAPS, in contrast, never charges 
students 
and 
offers 
free 
counseling 
indefinitely for those with extenuating 
circumstances that prevent them from 
finding appropriate, outside long-term care. 
Sevig said U-M CAPS’ efforts to provide 
medium and longer-term service without 
charging students means it cannot base 
its appointment model on walk-ins like 
MSU CAPS. The report showed about 26 
percent of patients saw CAPS for six or 
more sessions last school year.
CAPS can offer longer treatment 
for students who are experiencing 
a complex reaction to a traumatic 
event, are uninsured or do not have 
transportation to off-campus referrals. 
Sevig said the average number of 
sessions is four to five, but it is important 
to continuously make appointments 
available. 
“We’ll see the person,” Sevig said. 

“We’ll do it whenever we can. Our staff 
will do extra to fit students in, but I would 
like to, on a systemic level, increase our 
ongoing work to do more than average.”
While students have complained 
about the inadequacy of CAPS at the 
University, many schools look to U-M 
services as a model to improve their own 
programs. Patishnock said Sevig has 
been helping MSU develop their CAPS 
service, which has been around for less 
than two years.
“We have 29 full-time counselors,” 
Patishnock said. “I understand the 
University of Michigan has even more 
counselors per student. We’re trying to 
get ourselves about even with where you 
guys are.”
Big Ten Conference and Okanagan 
Charter 
The University is not alone in its 
efforts 
to 
improve 
mental 
health. 
Representatives 
from 
CAPS 
attend 
the yearly Big Ten Counseling Centers 
Convention to exchange ideas with 
similar-sized schools. According to Sevig, 
the idea for embedded counselors — a 
branch of professionals from CAPS who 
specialize in the culture and students 
of different colleges throughout the 
University — came from Northwestern 
University and the University of Iowa. 
“It was really radical because in our 
profession, we have this idea that you have 
to come to us,” Sevig said. “So I waited 
for them to implement it for a year, and it 
was still working really well there. Then 
I wrote up this model for seven of our 

staff to be with the four schools on North 
Campus and three of the professional 
schools on Central Campus and it all got 
funded.” 
The University is also a member of 
the Okanagan Charter, an international 
charter for health-promoting universities 
and colleges aimed at promoting overall 
well-being 
on 
campus. 
Wolverine 
Wellness Director Mary Jo Desprez 
said the charter guides many of the 
University’s efforts on mental health.
To 
illustrate 
how 
the 
Charter’s 
framework could improve day-to-day 
practices, Desprez gave the example of 
a professor who can choose between 
setting a paper deadline at midnight or 
at six o’clock in the morning. While the 
six o’clock deadline gives students more 
time, she said many students would stay 
up all night writing.
“There’s no reason the paper can’t be 
due at three o’clock in the afternoon,” 
Desprez said. “That is a way a faculty 
member can contribute to the health and 
well-being of the community just based 
on one small change.”
Orientation 
During 
freshman 
orientation, 
the 
Educational 
Theater 
Company 
performances mention CAPS and include 
a presentation for parents as well. 
However, many students told The Daily 
they are unaware of how they can make an 
appointment with CAPS and how to get to 
their office. LSA sophomore Eva Schwarz 
told The Daily that finding out how to 
make an appointment was more difficult 

than making the actual appointment.
“I went to make an appointment and it 
took a lot of navigating, figure out how to 
watch a video and then the video, people 
acting out like a scene and then it finally 
tells you how to make your appointment, 
which you can’t even do online,” Schwarz 
said. “To me, it seems like such an ordeal 
to go through the process of trying to use 
the University’s resources.” 
Schwarz 
did 
not 
remember 
the 
information from orientation, raising 
concerns if it actually sticks with students.
In contrast, Ben Crino, Western 
Michigan University sophomore, told 
The Daily that WMU tells students about 
their mental health resources and how 
they work during orientation. Unlike 
the University students interviewed, he 
remembered this information.
“I did my orientation a month before 
school started and they take you right to 
the building, then they take you inside 
and they take you to one of the rooms,” 
Crino said. “They take your whole group 
like a tour, but they make sure to really 
cover that place. You know where it is on 
campus, you know what it looks like and 
you know how to (make an appointment).”
When asked if the University was 
aware that students felt they did not 
retain information presented about CAPS 
during orientation, Sevig said he would 
be open to working on ways to make the 
information more prevalent. He said he 
would be interested in making a CAPS 
office stop as part of the campus tour like 
Western Michigan does.

“I think that’s a great idea,” Sevig said. 
“We’d be happy to do it.”
Wellness Clubs at Other Universities
Student efforts to improve the well-
being on campus are also not unique to 
Ann Arbor, as examples of like-minded 
organizations can be found across the 
country.
For 
example, 
Northwestern 
University’s Happiness Club “encourages 
and facilitates random acts of kindness 
… creating moments that lead those 
involved to think, ‘That just made my 
day!’” according to the organization’s 
website.
The University of California, Berkeley, 
often ranked as a top public university 
along with the University of Michigan, is 
home to mental health promotion clubs 
like You Mean More, De-Stress with Dogs 
and Art & Mind.
Akash Rathod, a freshman at the 
University of California, Berkeley, said he 
is grateful for the student support at the 
highly competitive school. He recently 
attended a session for the Berkeley 
University Health Services nutrition 
team focusing on the intersection of 
healthy food and well-being. Rathod 
said he believes having wellness clubs is 
important to students prioritizing their 
mental health.
 “I think the organizations have had 
a positive impact,” Rathod said. “A 
lot of students that need the help and 
were previously not getting the help 
are getting more resources and are in a 
better position now.”

together to feed off the energy of 
the people next to you and really 
feed off the music,” Krull said. 
“You’re supposed to disconnect 
from your phone, from metrics … 
really enjoy that 45 minutes of your 
day for yourself.”
LSA freshman Celene Philip has 
participated in SoulCycle classes 
before. Philip said she enjoys the 
non-competitive aspect of the 
workout.
“The instructors stress a lot 
that the only person you’re here 
for is yourself, and they stress a 
lot about the idea that you don’t 
have to follow their guidelines,” 

Philip said. “You just need to push 
yourself enough that you are out of 
your comfort zone.”
Krull said each class is capped at 
47 people and led by an instructor. 
The 
selection 
process 
for 
instructors is competitive, she said.
After regional auditions, Krull 
said 
prospective 
instructors 
spend eight weeks in New York 
City or Los Angeles to train. 
Then, they teach practice classes 
in 
their 
respective 
markets, 
which Krull described as having 
“cut-throat” 
competition 
with 
high expectations for technique 
perfection.
SoulCycle faced controversy in 
August when its owner, prominent 
University donor Stephen M. Ross, 
held a fundraiser for President 
Donald 
Trumps’s 
re-election 

campaign. SoulCycle released a 
statement on Twitter, signed by 
CEO Melanie Whelan, saying 
the company did not endorse the 
fundraiser.
LSA sophomore Nicole Lin 
participates in Michigan Muscle 
Club 
and 
has 
heard 
about 
SoulCycle from her teammates. 
She said she is hoping to try it.
“I’ve heard a lot about cycling 
classes, so I would be willing to 
try it,” Lin said. “It’s really good 
cardio, especially since I’m not a 
fan of running.” 
However, 
Lin 
is 
slightly 
concerned about the prices of the 
classes. New riders receive an offer 
of $20 per class, and $26 per class 
afterwards. In an email to The 
Daily, Kimberly Gibbs, SoulCycle’s 
director of public relations and 

communications, noted that for 
the first time ever at the Ann Arbor 
studio, SoulCycle is offering a 
discounted $22 class for students 
with a valid ID.
Philip 
shared 
a 
similar 
sentiment to Lin’s regarding cost, 
but said she thinks it will be a fun 
workout she can do every once in 
a while. 
“It can be pretty hard for people 
to afford it,” Philip said. “On one 
hand, it can be good for people 
who come from big cities that often 
do SoulCycle when they’re home 
so they can have a piece of home 
to bring with them to Ann Arbor. 
But I also think that hopefully 
SoulCycle will market it in a way 
that’s more accessible to people 
here.”

“The thing that’s different 
about this particular picture is 
that it’s cognitively balanced 
and the virtues have opposites,” 
Quinn said. “This picture is 
very simple, yet very complex. 
The average manager does not 
have this picture in their head.”
His 
final 
point, 
social 
excellence, was based on the 
story of Gerry Anderson, chief 
executive officer of DTE Energy. 
When the recession of 2008 hit, 
Quinn said Anderson consulted 

with a financial advisor and was 
told he would have to cut his 
labor force. According to Quinn, 
Anderson decided to be honest 
with his employees. 
“Gerry goes to his ‘herd of 
horses’ and he says, ‘Let me share 
with you what’s really going 
on,’” Quinn said. “‘I don’t want 
to downsize. I’ll do anything to 
avoid downsizing. Problem is, I 
don’t know what to do. I believe 
you (the employees) do.’” 
Quinn made the point CEOs 
do not typically admit when 
they do not know something. 
However, 
Quinn 
claimed 
Anderson’s authenticity helped 

the company have its best year 
in 2010. 
Chinelo Onuigbo, CJ Greer 
and Ty Moreno are master’s 
students in the School of Social 
Work. Onuigbo said the three 
came to the talk for a class. 
Moreno also said they wanted 
to learn new leadership styles.
“We came here because we’re 
learning about new leadership 
styles and new philosophies,” 
Moreno said. “Not just, ‘You do 
what I say,’ but, ‘What does the 
group want?’ The idea of group 
wisdom versus manager wisdom.” 
Onuigbo said she enjoyed 
the talk and liked the multiple 

options provided.
“There were a lot of different 
models to consider and maybe 
adapt to different scenarios and 
work styles,” Onuigbo said. 
Greer said he particularly liked 
the example with Anderson. 
“I thought that the talk was 
very innovative, and it was 
very practical in the examples 
that it used, especially hitting 
close to home using DTE as an 
example,” Greer said. 
However, 
though 
Moreno 
enjoyed the talk, she admitted 
she had heard much of it before. 
She speculated the talk might be 
differently received by different age 
groups in the audience. 
“Individuals 
from 
the 
community who are out 
of school and are much 
older and maybe learning 
this as something brand 
new,” Moreno said. “And 
there’s 
students 
who, 
I 
think from our generation, 
are already hip to this. It’s 
very intuitive because we 
are not a generation who 
wants to be told what to do. 
We aren’t a generation that 
doesn’t 
have 
confidence 
in our own answers. To 
see this laid out in an 
educational framework is 
nice, but I didn’t think it 
was revolutionary.”

EPA 
Deputy 
Director 
Joan Tanaka expressed 
the importance of the 
EPA working with state 
officials 
to 
contain 
the 
toxic 
chemicals 
spreading 
throughout 
the groundwater in Ann 
Arbor. 
“We understand that 
lots of stuff is going on 
right now, there’s going 
to be a lot of talking,” 
Tanaka said. “I don’t 
think 
anybody 
wants 
the 
problems 
to 
get 
worse and so we would 
be working together to 
figure out how it could 
not (get worse).”
Tanaka also said the 
site 
is 
not 
currently 
considered a Superfund 
site, a site requiring long-
term care which receives 
government 
support, 
because the groundwater 
contamination is not at 
a point of causing harm 
to people. Without this 
classification, it does not 
require emergency funds 
for cleanup from the EPA 
or from the responsible 
party, Gelman Sciences, 
Tanaka said. 
Currently, EGLE is in 
charge of making sure 
the level of the toxic 
dioxane chemical stays 
below a certain level and 
does not harm Ann Arbor 
residents. 
The 
meeting 
then 
moved to city and county 
officials asking the panel 
specific questions. Most 
of the questions were 
geared 
towards 
the 
EGLE, Attorney General 
official and the EPA to 
better 
understand 
the 
timeline of diminishing 
the plume. 
Tanaka 
explained 
that at most it would 
take 
approximately 
25 

years for the plume to 
be entirely cleaned up 
by the EPA, but in the 
meantime, 
EGLE 
will 
continue to monitor the 
plume. 
The 
discussion 
then 
opened up to questions 
from 
all 
community 
members in attendance. 
Community 
members 
asked 
questions 
about 
the timeline of cleanup 
efforts and who would be 
in charge of the cleanups. 
Rita Loch-Caruso, an 
environmental 
health 
sciences professor who 
attended 
the 
panel, 
spoke to The Daily after 
the meeting about her 
concerns.
“I’m 
very 
concerned 
about the plume,” Loch-
Caruso said. “I live on 
the west side of Ann 
Arbor 
and 
I’ve 
been 
going to these meetings 
for over ten years, and I 
have watched the plume 
advance 
toward 
my 
property. I’ve lived in our 
home for over 35 years 
year. The plume is now 
under my house.” 
Loch-Caruso 
also 
discussed her thoughts 
on 
the 
community 
meeting after hearing the 
different representatives 
from 
the 
different 
agencies speak. She left 
the meeting feeling like 
there is more work to be 
done on this issue.
“What 
I 
take 
away 
is that we still have an 
uphill battle to climb,” 
Loch-Caruso said. “It’s 
not clear to me though 
that 
the 
regulatory 
groups from the different 
government agencies and 
the different government 
entities and jurisdictions 
are really going to be 
able to come together in 
agreement, but I really 
hope so because I think 
we need a solution.”

Green home incentives

L

ike many homes rented 
by students in Ann Arbor, 
my 
house 
was 
built 
over 100 years ago. Due to the 
antique, inoperable fire alarm still 
attached to our kitchen wall and 
the significant breeze felt near a 
closed window, I cannot help but 
wonder what level of care has been 
taken in bringing this home into 
the 21st century.
The temperature is dropping, 
and the heating bills are rising. 
My housemates and I crank up 
our thermostat but often still 
feel cold in our home. As an 
environmentalist, it pains me to 
think about all of the energy and 
resources that go into heating 
this home just to be lost through 
our outdated windows and poor 
insulation. Leaking windows are 
the culprit for 25 to 30 percent of 
heat loss in a home.
The 2012 Ann Arbor greenhouse 
gases (GHG) inventory found that 
the residential sector makes up 22 
percent of Ann Arbor greenhouse 
gas emissions. Over half of Ann 
Arbor’s housing units are rentals, 
which means that the energy 
efficiency of these rental units has 
a huge impact on the city’s overall 
GHG emissions. A report shows 
that energy efficiency upgrades 
could reduce the United States’ 
emissions by half.
Landlords have no economic 
incentives to improve the energy 
efficiency of a home when renters 
are 
responsible 
for 
paying 
electricity 
and 
water 
bills. 
This is problematic as it leads 
to extremely outdated homes. 
Replacing windows or appliances 
are home improvement measures 
that are not very invasive or 
difficult. The payoff is long-term 
for those paying the bill and for the 
energy grid we are so reliant on.
However, if landlords cover 

the costs of utilities and instead 
incorporate them into monthly 
rent 
(which 
some 
landlords 
do already), residents have no 
monetary incentive to reduce 
their daily usage. This is an issue 
of competing split incentives. A 
compromise is necessary so that 
both parties have some incentive 
to reduce energy waste for the 
benefit of students’ wallets and 
emissions reductions.
There should be some level 
of accountability for landlords 
while still leaving some financial 
incentive for renters to limit their 
usage. One option would be if 
the management company was 
required to pay the remainder of 
our bill after it reaches a certain 
maximum (in a deductible-style). 
Another would be if it were 
required to pay a percentage of 
our utility bills. Or maybe the 
state should raise the Michigan 
energy improvement tax incentive 
of 10 percent so landlords to want 
to improve the efficiency of the 
homes they manage.
Another way to hold landlords 
accountable for the efficiency of 
their homes would be to simply 
require that the insulation and 
appliances of a home meet a certain 
energy standard, similar to how 
homes must meet strict fire codes. 
Just as there is an inspection of 
fire safety standards, there could 
be an inspection of efficiency 
standards where records must 
be presented to prove that, for 
example, the windows have been 
updated in the past 20 years. Like 
fire hazards and asbestos, energy 
inefficiency can be considered 
a safety threat. While perhaps 
more abstract, outdated homes are 
indeed contributing to the safety 
threat of climate change.
Living in an old house rather 
than an updated apartment is 

a dramatically less sustainable 
lifestyle. Simply, the land use and 
energy for a single-family home 
outweigh that of a multi-family 
dwelling unit. That being said, 
the old homes of Ann Arbor give 
the city its character and charm. 
For me, living in one of these old 
houses has been a wonderful, 
unique experience. 
There is something to be 
said for the water usage in old 
homes as well as energy usage. 
Landlords 
and 
management 
companies can update water 
appliances 
and 
greatly 
reduce the water usage of a 
home. Low-flow faucets and 
showerheads are an example. 
Another is simply having a 
dishwasher, which uses less 
water 
than 
hand-washing 
(unfortunately, my rental house 
lacks a dishwasher, like many 
in Ann Arbor). But, similar to 
electricity use, there has to 
be some financial incentive or 
requirement for a homeowner 
to want to spend on these water-
saving investments.
The student housing market 
in Ann Arbor is such that this 
house, built in 1901, will continue 
to rent out each year, no matter 
if efficiency updates are made or 
not. After all, student housing 
in Ann Arbor has reached 98 
percent occupancy each year 
since 2014. Even with high 
rent prices and dreadful utility 
bills, students will continue to 
pay to live in my house built 
over a century ago. The paint is 
chipping, and the bathroom door 
has no lock, but the thing about 
this old house that really matters 
is the functionality of it in the 
new century.

Gender-neutral bathrooms aren’t for everyone
A

s transgender issues have 
entered the forefront of 
American 
politics, 
the 
issue of public restrooms has been 
contested in courtrooms across 
the nation. Between 2013 and 2016, 
almost half of states made efforts to 
pass laws restricting transgender 
people’s access to single-gender 
facilities by their “biological sex,” 
often with public schools as the 
battlegrounds. With the debate 
over where transgender individuals 
should use the restroom becoming 
more and more heated, many public 
facilities have opted for the middle 
ground: gender-neutral bathrooms.
Bathroom bills — the most recent 
of which is the Kentucky School 
Privacy Act — and gender-neutral 
restrooms arose in response to 
widespread social anxiety over 
visibly trans people using gendered 
restrooms. While the courts argued 
with no verdict in sight, gender 
non-specific bathrooms were the 
easy solution. Rather than wholly 
accepting or rejecting transgender 
people, 
gender 
non-specific 
bathrooms create a third space 
where we can be ignored entirely. A 
bathroom that welcomes all genders 
eliminates the debate entirely.
The University of Michigan is 
one of the countless colleges now 
offering a gender-neutral bathroom 
option for its students. Currently, the 
Spectrum Center lists 102 “gender-
inclusive” restrooms in campus 
buildings, 
not 
including 
those 
within the dorms themselves. The 
term “gender-inclusive,” however, 
is misleading. People of any gender 
can use them, that is true, but that 
doesn’t mean they are supposed to.
The issue: When anyone can 
use a facility, anyone will. This is 
how I find myself waiting for one 
of Alice Lloyd Hall’s two single-
use 
gender-neutral 
bathrooms 
to become available each night. 
Unsurprisingly, with 520 students 
living in the building, I’m rarely 
fortunate enough to gain access to 
a restroom when I need it. And yet, 
I’m still luckier than the students 
in the many halls with no gender-
inclusive showers or restrooms 
whatsoever. For most, these single-
use restrooms are seen as a luxury. 
They’re private, they’re cleaner, 
they’re (typically) newer. But for 
transgender students — the people 
these restrooms are meant to 

accommodate — it’s often a matter 
of safety.
For transgender students who 
pass as their gender, not being able 
to use gender-inclusive restrooms 
isn’t an issue, but this isn’t always 
the case. Androgynous-looking or 
mid-transition trans people may look 
out-of-place in both male and female 
restrooms. The state of Michigan 
doesn’t have laws explicitly forcing 
transgender 
people 
into 
the 
bathroom of their assigned sex at 
birth, but because University housing 
cards only give students access to 
the restroom matching their legal 
gender, students aren’t always able 
to use the restroom they’d feel safer 
in. A student who looks like one 
gender (for instance, someone who is 
far along in transition but can’t get a 
legal gender change yet) is forced to 
use the bureaucractically-mandated 
restroom rather than the one 
their appearance implies, causing 
problems not just for the individual, 
but everyone involved. Whether or 
not people should feel threatened 
by the existence of trans people in 
gendered spaces, we know that they 
do. If cis people weren’t afraid of 
us, we would only have to deal with 
the discomfort of feeling out-of-
place, not the fear of being treated as 
predators. Trans people do not want 
to make ourselves or others upset by 
using the “wrong” restroom, but we 
often aren’t given any other choice. 
While 
individual 
incidents 
at the University have not been 
publicized, 21.3 percent of trans and 
genderqueer U-M students reported 
being a victim of nonconsensual 
sexual contact, surpassed only by 
undergraduate cisgender women 
at a rate of 26.9 percent. However, 
the same survey also found that 
only 42.1 percent of trans students 
thought campus officials would take 
a sexual misconduct report seriously, 
the lowest rate of any group, and 
a mere 23.5 percent expected an 
investigation of said misconduct 
would be fair (all other groups had 
rates over 40 percent). Perhaps most 
startling is the manner in which 
these assaults occur. When the 
results are broken up by the use of 
physical force, inability to consent 
or both, trans students are the only 
group that solely reported physical 
force as a tactic. Concurrently, an 
AAP study of transgender teens 
found that the risk of sexual assault 

was higher for students who had 
restricted restroom access at school. 
Public restrooms are far from the 
only reason trans students are being 
assaulted, but they are an undeniable 
factor in the trend. At the very least, 
restrooms serve as a venue for the 
act.
Gender-inclusive 
bathrooms 
are meant to be a safe haven for 
transgender students, but it’s this 
very inclusivity that often renders 
the spaces useless. They were 
designed to push trans people out 
of gendered bathrooms for the sake 
of cisgender society’s comfort — the 
safety of trans people was merely 
a fortunate byproduct. And, sure 
enough, these restrooms made 
to make cisgender people more 
comfortable are so often used by 
them out of a preference for privacy 
at the expense of their trans peers’ 
well-being.
Having access to safe restrooms 
is especially vital on college 
campuses because many students 
have no access to private restrooms. 
Those who live in the dorms 
almost invariably have to shower 
there, too. There is nowhere else 
for transgender students to go if 
their residence hall lacks a gender-
neutral restroom, or if the few in 
their building are always occupied.
Creating safe restrooms for 
trans 
and 
genderqueer 
U-M 
students requires individual action 
as well as the implementation 
of large-scale change by the 
University. Trans students need a 
gender-neutral restroom option, 
regardless of which residence 
hall they live in. We need an 
appropriate number of restrooms 
for the size of the building, or 
gender-neutral bathrooms with 
stalls to accommodate more than 
one student at a time. However, 
these efforts will be useless unless 
cisgender students are willing to 
acknowledge why these changes 
are being made in the first place. 
It is easy to forget that restrooms 
labeled “gender-inclusive” have 
an intended audience, and it is even 
easier to ignore it when the privacy 
of a single-use room is so tempting. 
By thinking twice before taking 
advantage of a vacant restroom, you 
can make someone else’s day safer.

Language in a poltically correct 2020

T

he First Amendment of the 
United States Constitution 
is unabridged freedom 
of speech and expression — even 
ahead of our right to bear arms. 
Today, more than 200 years later, 
there are virtually no laws limiting 
speech, but there are thousands of 
federal and state laws governing 
actions. Not to worry. Every day, 
an angry mob of underqualified 
commentators is imposing limits on 
speech and thought more powerful 
than any law ever contemplated 
by our founders. Say the wrong 
word, think the wrong thought 
and the mob will shame you into 
submission and silence, ensuring 
you will always watch your tongue 
and “speak right.” 
“Speak right” is a term I use to 
explain the following phenomenon: 
similar to George Orwell’s famous 
term “NewsSpeak,” peers and 
commentators 
act 
as 
political 
correctness police who pressure 
people to “speak correctly.” Under 
this cultural norm, the wrong 
word or phrase can leave a person 
permanently marked as “bigoted” 
even if their values and actions 
prove otherwise. In the book 
“1984,” nonconformists would be 
jailed for critical speech, and yet 
pressure can work just as well to 
shame people into silence. With 
“speak right,” words speak louder 
than actions.
Many believe President Donald 
Trump has utilized racially-coded 
rhetoric, so he’s racist. Never mind 
that the first piece of legislature 
he supported — the First Step Act 
— passed criminal justice reforms 
that benefited the Black community 
more than any other demographic. 
Due to his work in the economy, 
Black unemployment under his 
administration is at an all-time low. 
What is racist about those actions?
Hillary Clinton, by contrast, has 
not been subject to the same level of 
scrutiny for her political speech. It 
went largely ignored, for instance, 
that in 1996, Clinton referred 
to young black criminals as 
“superpredators.” More startlingly, 
I’d argue, is that actions taken by 
the Clintons were detrimental 
to the black community. The 
Clintons supported a crime bill 
which 
held 
harsh 
provisions 
for the incarceration of drug 
traffickers and disproportionately 
affected Black citizens — in 
seven states, 80 to 90 percent 
of imprisoned drug traffickers 
were 
Black. 
Additionally, 
while 
white 
unemployment 
rates fell to record lows under 
Clinton’s administration, Black 
unemployment 
rates 
were 
consistently twice as high and in 

some years, even higher. 
Whereas we speak in a stream 
of consciousness, our actions are 
thought out and deliberate and 
therefore should be evaluated with 
more weight. However, people’s 
speech is the subject of a lot of 
criticism today. People fail to realize 
that those who are politically 
correct can be just as bigoted, 
if not more so, than those who 
aren’t. The real concern attached 
to political correctness is the 
lack of transparency. People may 
think one way and speak another. 
In fact, as controversial as it is, 
a politician’s racist gaffe should 
probably be more worrisome than 
a kid whose vocabulary includes 
racist slang. 

I’d argue that the former is 
more likely to be conscious of what 
they’re saying so when they have a 
speech mishap, it probably reflects 
their true beliefs because they 
said precisely the thing they were 
trying to avoid. Politically incorrect 
people — on the other hand—are 
less conscious of what they’re 
saying, so when they say something 
bigoted, it may be reflective of their 
bigoted notions, but it may also be 
due to nurtured ignorance. While 
ignorance can’t and shouldn’t 
be excused, I believe a lack of 
knowledge is less malicious than 
true racism, sexism, etc. 
The term “political correctness” 
by its nature does little to expose 
racist people and is more often used 
to censor or silence people. When 
one’s character is truly pure, they 
shouldn’t have to worry about what 
they might say. Actions will always 
shine through and mirror one’s 
character. 
In a creative writing class, I 
saw political correctness stunting 
creativity firsthand. My friend 
was eager to share a piece he had 
worked on for a long time. The 
piece, a romantic short story, 
centered around a heterosexual 
relationship. My professor spent 
the majority of class ripping my 
friend’s story apart because the 
female part didn’t have as many 
lines or vivacious characteristic 
traits as the male counterpart. He 
noted my friend’s piece fell into a 

trope and decided that was pretty 
much all there was to it.
In my final piece, my professor 
flagged the word “they” when 
referring to Mexicans, which he 
deemed insensitive and directed 
me to a list of politically incorrect 
terms. As a Mexican-American 
myself, it felt as though my 
intentions were being completely 
overlooked. It seemed that the 
words my friend and I chose were 
more important than what the 
story told — my friend’s overall 
story wasn’t sexist, nor was mine 
racist. 
It is hard to be politically 
correct in a world where “they” 
can’t be used. Political correctness 
in 
general 
is 
subjective 
— 
some consider Black to be the 
appropriate term, while others 
deem 
it 
offensive, 
preferring 
African American. It is more 
fruitful to look beyond the terms 
to people’s underlying intentions. 
Moreover, creative works can 
be good even if they aren’t 
progressive. The establishment of 
political correctness encourages 
uniform, progressive works. If an 
author can’t write a book without 
a progressive plot, we may end up 
with a lot of princess-and-princess 
fairytales but no way of knowing 
whether those authors actually 
supported homosexuality or just 
needed to check off a “politically 
correct” box.
Even though we may need more 
roles like these, they shouldn’t be 
placed by default because it may 
be blatant they were incorporated 
as an afterthought and weren’t 
uniquely developed. My professor 
would’ve liked if my friend added 
more female lines. If afterwards 
he did, however, it might suggest 
that dominant female roles are 
unnatural and therefore, have to 
be forced. Underneath the blanket 
of political correctness, there’s no 
way of knowing whether notions 
of equality and justice were 
actually realized or if they were 
forced into submission.
The end result of political 
correctness is always an approved 
form of speech (“speak right”) but 
not always a better set of actions. 
Free speech should be adamantly 
preserved if we want to progress as 
an equal and just society. The fear 
of being politically incorrect does 
nothing to shift people’s notions, 
but everything to silence true 
beliefs. The only way to combat 
ignorance is to let people speak 
freely and convince them of their 
ill-guided conceptions.

We all want to be remembered 
— there’s no doubt about that. If 
we didn’t, fame wouldn’t be so 
coveted and patent lawyers would 
be out of a job. But when it comes 
to making history, few of us are 
ever able to achieve anything 
“noteworthy.” Or are we? Terrence 
Malick’s (“Song to Song”) newest 
film, “A Hidden Life,” challenges 
the idea that, in order to leave a 
mark on the world our actions 
have to be outstanding. Instead, 
it suggests that simply following 
through on our beliefs, even in the 
face of serious adversity, is enough 
to make an impact on the world. 
The film explores this idea 
through the life of Franz (August 
Diehl, “Salt”), an Austrian farmer 
called up to fight for the Nazi 

regime. Though “A Hidden Life” 
provides a timely conversation 
about what it means to “make 
history,” the film lacks any intrigue 
beyond the typical violence of the 
Nazis. 
“A Hidden Life” should not have 
been three hours long. The official 
runtime is 2.88 hours — 2.88 hours 
filled with Austrian mountainside, 
German prisons and little else. 
Though the contrast between a 
peaceful farming village and bare 
prison yards help create jarring 
transitions, 
the 
scenery 
adds 
nothing to the plot. The mood of 
the film was often affected by the 
cloud cover, but one can only stare 
at on-screen clouds for so long. 
The film is eventually split 
between two viewpoints — that of 
Franz in the German prison after 
having refused his position as a 

soldier and that of his wife, Fani 
(Valerie Pachner, “Bad Luck”). 
The 
couple’s 
letters, 
provided 
as voiceovers between scenes, 
narrate their feelings and longings 
as they grapple with Franz’s 
strained relationship with the 
Germans and Fani’s increasing 
loneliness. But even as they pour 
out their feelings, there is little to 
no emotional connection between 
the characters and the audience. 
Even though Fani bursts into tears 
while tilling the fields and the 
audience takes Franz’s point of 
view while being beaten by a Nazi, 
there is little passion. Instead of 
tearing up at the tragedies Franz 
and his family faced, most in the 
audience, myself included, just 
watched indifferently as these 
moments unfolded.
Eventually, this leads to a pair 
of 
one-dimensional 
characters 
whose only distinctive quality 
is their farm in Austria. There is 
little nuance to the film’s message 
— Franz is nothing more than 
a man dying for his cause. And 
maybe that’s exactly just who he 
was. The simplicity doesn’t take 
away from the nobility of his 
actions, but it does mean that his 
story should be saved for World 
War II documentaries watched in 
high school history classes.
The intent of the story is not the 
problem here. It’s still incredibly 
important to remind ourselves 
that our individual actions have 
consequences, 
no 
matter 
how 
small. Unsung heroes from wars 
should be remembered. But not at 
the expense of a plot. With further 

research, or even just a basic 
understanding of how Hollywood 
works, it becomes increasingly 
clear why Franz’s story was told: 
he is a man. God forbid we make 
movies about women during the 
war that aren’t an American Girl 
Doll story. It’s obvious that the 
Austrian farmer’s story should 
be told before the women who 
cracked key Nazi codes and helped 
win the war.
It is important to discuss men 
like Franz, the ones who quietly 
sacrificed their lives to stand up 
for their beliefs. We obviously can’t 
all be the next Greta Thurnberg or 
Gandhi. But that also doesn’t mean 
we have to devote a three-hour 
film and $7 million to $9 million, 
according to Wikipedia, to a story 
that could be told in a 15 minute 
segment in a Netflix documentary.

‘A Hidden Life’: a film that 
should have stayed hidden

FILM REVIEW

I watched a video about five years ago that 
detailed how states in the U.S. would be affected 
by climate change in the next 50 years. Moving 
from west to east, I saw the expected: more 
droughts and wildfires on the West Coast, intense 
hurricanes in the East and rising sea levels all 
throughout the continental U.S., with large 
areas of Florida and North Carolina underwater. 
But what about the Midwest? Many hold a 
misconception that climate change will affect the 
Midwest less severely. The video affirmed this, 
concluding that Michigan would be one of the 
safest states to live in the near future. While this 
may, in part, be true, we often overlook one key 
factor: the Great Lakes. 
Water levels of the Great Lakes have been 
steadily rising, with a record rise in water levels 
from 2014 to the present. News feeds are cluttered 
with images of entirely submerged lakeshore 
properties, or staircases and ceilings being swept 
away by the passing water. Many of us may 
recognize that climate change is responsible 
for these rising water levels, but will they ever 
return to normal? And if not, won’t our Michigan 
shorelines suffer? 
The Great Lakes Theme Semester, hosted 
through LSA, tries to give us some answers. This 
past Monday was the first panel in a series of six 
intended to give the public perspective on issues 
surrounding the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes 
Theme Semester also includes museum and 
photography exhibitions, among other events 
featured throughout campus.
Speakers at this first panel, titled “Dynamic 
Lakes and Lake Dynamics,” included Drew 
Gronewold, 
professor 
in 
the 
School 
of 
Environment and Sustainability, Guy Meadows 
of the Great Lakes Research Center at Michigan 
Technological University, Susan Och of Leland 
Township Parks and Recreation and James Clift, 
deputy director of the Michigan Department of 
Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy. 
Effects of climate change are startling, which 
is why some of us avoid thinking about it unless 
we have to. Climate change is also a slow process 
(remember, climate not weather), making it hard 
to directly observe unless an expert points it 

out to us. The term “eco-anxiety,” anxiety about 
natural threats such as climate change, has 
been coined in the last decade, and it’s easy to 
understand why. Large scale global changes are 
stressful, even more so when options seem bleak 
without policy change. But I’ve found something 
strangely reassuring in talking about climate 
change with my friends, colleagues, experts or 
even roommates. This is the conversation that 
“Dynamic Lakes and Lake Dynamics” intended 
to continue.
The panel offered both scientific and political 
perspectives on the Great Lakes, contrasting topics 
like the hydrological cycle and shoreline erosion 
with local and state-wide policies. Gronewold 
said the water levels of the lakes tend to oscillate 
between extreme highs and lows (unlike sea 
levels, which have been rising consistently for the 
last 150 years). Lows occur when higher average 
temperatures cause evaporation to increase, and 
highs occur when this increased moisture falls as 
heavy rainfall. It’s hard to predict the water level 
of the lakes in any given year, a trend that climate 
change is responsible for (this tug of war between 
extremes is the same reason that Michigan has 
extremely cold winter during some years, but very 
warm winters during others). This fluctuation 
between high and low water levels, as well as 
increased wave energy, has devastating effects 
through the process of shoreline erosion. Beaches 
and cliffs are being pushed further back each 
year, blurring the line between public and private 
property along the lakes. 
So, what can we do? In truth, not much. Water 
levels are dependent on continental moisture 
patterns, which by nature are challenging to 
predict. Aside from building lakeshore properties 
further from the shore, controlling one of the 
world’s largest reserves of freshwater is no easy 
task. Our best bet is to curb the effects of global 
warming at the individual and national level. 
Michigan will likely become a state that lives along 
the extremes, as will many other states in the U.S. 
As much as we like to believe it, the Midwest is 
not exempt from climate change. The Great Lakes 
Theme Semester opens up an important and 
accessible dialogue that I urge everyone to be a 
part of.

Theme Semester and future panels can be found

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW

This past Monday, after attending Kiley’s Reid’s 
book signing at Literati Bookstore and hearing her 
read from her hit debut novel “Such a Fun Age,” 
I spent my night reflecting on the nature of art, 
authorial intent and what I have appreciated so 
much about my recent reads. 
I didn’t anticipate this book signing to be as 
evocative and engaging as I’ve heard Reid’s novel 
to be, especially not as I awkwardly jostled in 
between other attendees to the only available seat 
in the front row — but I found myself surprised. I 
haven’t had the pleasure of reading “Such a Fun 
Age” yet, so this won’t be a review (for that, see 
fellow Arts writer Verity Sturm’s review here), but 
rather a reflection on how the event highlighted the 
transformational nature of a work of art, and how 
art ceases to be limited by authorial intent once the 
work takes on new meaning for someone else.
In many ways, Kiley Reid’s journey as a writer, 
as she outlined it throughout the Q&A segment, is 
emblematic of how a piece of writing can take on a 
life of its own, often in unexpected ways. Before her 
writing career, Reid was trained as an actress; she 
cited her love of telling stories as the underlying 
motive of this lost dream. In her early twenties, she 
landed a role in a commercial for a search engine 
and thought that the opportunity would finally be 
the gateway to a many-storied acting career, only 
to realize… she hated it. So, she decided to explore 
writing (again, citing her passion for stories), and 
set out on a journey that would lead her here. She 
applied to graduate school — two years in a row — 
nannied and, of course, wrote. 
Though not exactly a comprehensive biography, 
the portrait Reid presented of herself was as 
unpredictable as the way she characterized her 
novel’s journey. Reid began with a few fundamental 
ideas she wanted to explore — racial fetishism, 
awkward interactions and a weird three-person 
transactional relationship — but as the story 
evolved, it mutated in unexpected ways and took on 
a life of its own. Reid elaborated on a few things 
that surprised her, but what stuck out the most 
was how she seemed to continually underscore the 
autonomy of her characters. For example, veering 
away from using children in her story as convenient 
plot devices, Reid let “Briar be Briar,” who, like 
many other 3-year-olds, was basically “a useless 
person” in terms of contributing anything. And that 
naturalistic characterization was OK with Reid. 
Kiley Reid’s comfort with 

allowing characters and plots to develop in the most 
natural way reflects an embrace of the interpretive 
and applicable nature that art is inclined toward. 
Thankfully, it’s something she allowed her novel to 
do as well. At the start of the event, she reflected 
on her surprise upon hearing what others have 
said about “Such a Fun Age.” Readers have taken 
away themes and messages far beyond the original 
vision Reid meant to broadcast. The novel’s value 
to readers has gone far beyond the insights into 
class, race and awkward relationships that Reid 
originally intended. To some, it is also a gateway 
into the mind of a privileged but well-meaning 
individual, a meditation on friendship, the tension 
between a nanny and the mother of the child she’s 
nannying and so on.
Regardless of what it meant to Reid, her readers 
or anyone else, the book has a commentative power 
that is typical of well-written fiction. Complex 
and comprehensive literature is able to grow and 
flourish beyond the author’s original vision and in 
turn undergo various transformations in the eyes of 
each reader. In so many literature classes, we focus 
on authorial intent when analyzing a work, but 
when reading for pleasure, what the book means for 
you ultimately determines your level of enjoyment. 
I’m one of those unbearable English nerds, so I’m 
reminded of a lot of boring old literature when I think 
about what writings have taught me something. 
But there have also been recent releases that have 
demonstrated the same thematic transcendence, 
books from which I’ve gained wholly unintentional 
messages from. Maggie O’Farrell’s “I Am, I Am, I 
Am” is one such book and Matt Haig’s “Notes on a 
Nervous Planet” is another, but listening to Kiley 
Reid has truly made me realize how much we need 
to appreciate art that is able to do this. With these 
lenses on, I look forward to reading Reid’s hit, and 
seeing what other masterpieces she will create.

BOOKS EVENT REVIEW

The “What’s the Use?” music video was slated 
to shoot the day Mac Miller tragically died of a 
drug overdose in September 2018. His wounded 
fifth studio album Swimming was a month old. 
It’s a work of introspective resignation, a plea to 
stay afloat amid depression, substance abuse and 
heartbreak. There was a lot to look forward to for 
the forlorn, 26-year-old Mac. “I just wanna go on 
tour,” he tweeted the night before his death. 
In a strange, surreal sense, it feels as though 
Mac never left. In the 16 months since his passing, 
he’s been immortalized through the gestures 
and actions of a music community that felt a void 
after his loss. Even more than the music he made, 
his fans grieved his lost potential. Each album 
was its own era, a monumental improvement 
from the last. The posthumous release of Circles 
continues this legacy. Conceived as a sister 
album to Swimming, Circles was nearly complete 
before Mac’s death. The album is scheduled to be 
released on Jan. 17 and it feels odd to leave an era 
as fresh as Swimming behind. 
Circles’s lead single “Good News” was 
released earlier this week directly following 
news of the album. The song itself is a dejected 
portrayal of the isolation and indifference Mac 
felt during those last few months of his life. And 
while it’s definitely in the same headspace as 

Swimming, the song reveals Mac succumbing 
to his shattered interiority. He is exasperated, 
lonely and depressed. He doesn’t want “to find 
a way” as he did in “Ladders” and questions 
“Why does everybody need me to stay?” These 
jarring, surreal thoughts are accompanied 
by soft optimism in a sparse, plucky and 
breezy instrumental with some gentle bass 
embellishments.
The music video is just as hazy and ambient 
as its instrumentals. The six minute video is 
bookended by clips of Mac entering and leaving a 
recording studio. This takes viewers on a journey 
through trippy, ethereal animated scenes that 
depict a desert, garden and ocean among many 
other scenic destinations. There are videos 
and photo clips of Mac dancing, joking around 
and playing instruments as he sings wearily of 
his trials and tribulations. A sense of comfort 
accompanies every image, almost pastel colors 
standing out despite the despondent lyricism 
that carries them. Flowers, birds, horses and 
other lively images scatter every scene.
“Good News” is just as comforting and 
gorgeous as it is jarring. No one anticipated a 
posthumous release as personal as a Swimming 
track. This puts us in the same position many of 
us were in back in September 2018; Circles was 
produced in the same headspace as Swimming. 
They allow us to revisit the idea of legacy as we 
enter another era of Mac without him, just days 
before what would’ve been his 28th birthday.

Colony House is back 
on ‘Where I’m From’

Leave What’s Lost Behind, the upcoming 
album from the Nashville-native quartet 
Colony House, is lyrically fit to be a best-
selling novel. In just a few pre-released songs, 
the band has already crafted an inspiring 
account of their own dealings with the 
past, filled with vivid imagery of expansive 
landscapes and the notion of playing a role in 
something much larger than yourself. “Where 
I’m From,” their latest single off the new 
album, adds to this narrative by describing 
the beauty found in both joyful and painful 
moments. 
The song begins with steady finger snapping 
before opening up to an electric piano riff. 

With a mellow, resonant register, lead singer 
Caleb Chapman sings of “the scent of cedar” 
and “the warmth of a fire,” reminding us 
of the simple things about where we come 
from. The song as a whole is plain in nature, 
only incorporating a few musical elements 
and keeping the tune rather modest, but its 
simplicity pairs well with the soothing lyrics 
and creates a stunning sense of peace.
“Where I’m From” offers vulnerable 
sincerity and freedom in playing a small role 
in a bigger picture. Unlike their previous 
albums filled with catchy chants and abrupt 
transitions, Leave What’s Lost Behind is more 
mellow and reflective. It’s an opportunity for 
the band to take a step back and meditate on 
the past few years as an indie group slowly 
climbing up the charts.

Listening to Pop Smoke: 
an ill-advised decision
Consent and queer media

JIM WILSON
Daily Arts Writer

DANGER
KEEP OUT
HAZARDOUS MUSIC
As they say, “listening to Pop 
Smoke is always an ill-advised 
decision.” All right, maybe it’s just 
me (I say it at least once each week), 
but it’s true — the Brooklyn driller 
has the ability (read: gift) to pull 
listeners into his world and never 
let go. This, of course, isn’t a bad 
thing by any means, but it can create 
some sticky situations for sure. In 
the car, Pop Smoke can cause you 
to miss your turn and get lost. At 
a party, Pop Smoke can make you 
ignore everyone around you and 
exist solely as a body for the music 
to move through. In short, Pop 
Smoke can cause people to do some 
pretty wild things, but why? The 
answer, of course, is multifaceted, 
but it all comes down to one thing: 
808 Melo, his producer.
The East London producer 
has been crafting beats for UK 
drill and UK hip-hop acts for the 
past couple of years, but he has 
only produced a one-hit wonder, 
“Know Better,” a disrespectful and 
boastful track by Headie One and 
Rv. The dissonant melodies, off-
kilter hi-hats and sliding 808s on 
the vocal sample provide the two 
men with the perfect sonic palette 
to talk some greasy shit and spew 
rude comments. Thanks to 808 
Melo, “Know Better” has become 
a quintessential UK drill song and 
has even been used by Stormzy 
in his disappointing Wiley send, 
“DISAPPOINTED.”
Suffice to say, Melo’s time was 
bound to come, but he’d need an 
American to do it: someone with 
global appeal and what is to some 
a more tolerable accent. Pop Smoke 
was that someone. From the get-
go, the two men were a match 
made in drill heaven. Their earliest 
collaborations 
include 
“MPR” 
and “Flexin’,” two hard-hitting, 
hard-nose, hard-ass songs that 
immediately yanked listeners into 

their frigid landscapes. Though the 
sound had been popular in the UK 
since around 2016, to Americans, it 
was fresh and new. It was exciting 
in the same way Atlanta trap and 
Chicago drill were exciting when 
they first exploded into the scene. 
Now, all Melo and Pop would need 
was a breakout hit.
“Welcome to the Party” was that 
hit. When the track came out in May 
2019, it immediately caught fire. 
And for good reason. “Welcome 
to the Party” is an absolute banger, 
and I don’t say that lightly. It’s 
the kind of song that commands 
everyone’s attention for the track’s 
entire three minute and thirty-four 
second runtime. Pop Smoke is cold 
as ice on the track, using a staccato 
flow to deliver absurdist tough talk 
like “Bitch, I’m a thot, get me lit / 
Gun on my hip / One in the head 
/ Ten in the clip” and “Don’t let 
that Henny in my system / I catch 
a body, next day I forget it.” In his 
words, to be “welcome to the party” 
is to do what he has already been 
doing. The beauty of Pop Smoke is 
how assured of himself he is, like 
he knows he was bound to be the 
first to blow up with this sound. His 
charisma and energy is just plain 
infectious. 
However, 808 Melo is the 
reason that Pop Smoke was able to 
flex and move the way he does on 
“Welcome to the Party.” Melo’s beat 
is kicked off with what may be the 
best producer tag of 2019: a female 
voice slowly declaring, “Thisssss 
issss a Melooo beat.” As soon as the 
tag drops, you know both Pop and 

Melo are going to go to work. Melo 
does most of the heavy lifting by 
crafting an expertly simple beat, 
highlighted by reversed horror 
movie piano slashes and pulsating, 
gurgling 808 slides. Pop Smoke and 
808 Melo prove on “Welcome to the 
Party” that they’re the new rapper-
producer dynamic duo, and no one 
is going to challenge them soon.
Pop Smoke, thanks to “Welcome 
to the Party,” is on his way to 
becoming a breakout star, the 
harbinger of Brooklyn drill, similar 
to how Chief Keef introduced the 
world to Chicago drill. Hell, he was 
featured on Travis Scott’s Jackboys 
compilation on the song “GATTI,” 
co-produced by (surprise, surprise) 
808 Melo. Most of Pop’s other 
songs are variations on “Welcome 
to the Party,” but they all work so 
well that it does not matter at all. 
However, when Pop does break the 
mold, he transcends. On “PTSD,” 
from his debut tape Meet the Woo, 
he does his best 50 Cent impression 
and crushes it, delivering an 
impassioned 
and 
emotional 
performance. With time, hopefully, 
he continues to both break the mold 
while creating more drill classics.
What’s the point of all this? I’ll 
tell you: Pop Smoke is a force of 
nature, a veritable black hole. His 
charismatic gravity is so strong that 
nothing can escape him. He is one 
man sufficiently compact enough 
to disrupt the four dimensions of 
the spacetime continuum. So, don’t 
say I didn’t warn you when — not if 
— Pop Smoke takes over your entire 
world.

Trigger warning: This article 
discusses issues of sexual assault 
and violations of consent in the 
media.
I’ve recently taken the plunge 
into the Netflix original series Elite, 
a Spanish demi-soap revolving 
around 
the 
indoctrination 
of 
public high school students into 
an exclusive private academy and 
the lives of their opulently wealthy 
classmates. 
Over 
the 
course 
of its current two seasons, the 
round table cast find themselves 
embroiled in the throes of a murder 
investigation, a concurrent missing 
person investigation, class and 
racial tensions, relationship drama, 
sex scandals and light incest (why 
not pepper it in, right?). In many 
ways, it uses similar tactics as its 
most obvious predecessor, Gossip 
Girl, to draw in its audience. While 
it isn’t the same kind of buzzy 
location and fashion behemoth, 
it certainly offers an imaginary, 
salacious peek into the lives of 
the young, rich and powerful-
-subsisting viewers with high-
stakes, high-drama plot lines that 
play on a simultaneous disgust and 
fascination with extreme privilege 
and the kinds of problems that 
might come with it. My primary 
interest in watching the show, of 
course, is its undeniable queerness 
(before actually watching the show 
in earnest I just fast forwarded to 
all of the gay stuff), but like Mikelle 
Street of Out before me, I couldn’t 
help but notice there were some 
sticky dynamics going on around 
issues of consent, as well as familial 
and partner relations. This isn’t to 
say that the show presented these 
dynamics as acceptable behavior 
or even that by enjoying the show 
one is somehow co-signing them, 
but they certainly fall in line with 
how queer relations are often 
represented in the media, especially 
in content that’s marketed towards 
young adults. 
Some of the issues that I’m 
referencing 
specifically 
have 
already been touched on and I 
worry about belaboring points 
that have already effectively been 

made, and those are the actions 
of 
a 
bi-questioning 
character 
named Polo (Álvaro Rico.) In the 
first season, Polo and his then-
girlfriend, Carla (Ester Expósito), 
begin a three-way relationship with 
one of the new students, Christian 
(Miguél Herràn), and enter into it 
by pursuing a cuckolding fantasy 
without expressly telling him what 
was happening. Later that season, 
he establishes an imbalance of 
power between Christian and 
himself by offering him a modeling 
gig, specifically the cover of his 
mothers’ fashion magazine, and 
then initiating oral sex with him 
after his photoshoot with the 
knowledge that Christian had not 
expressed any interest in having 
direct sexual relations with men. In 
season two, he pressures his friend, 
Ander (Arón Piper), into kissing 
him and exchanging handjobs 
in the same bed as their friend, 
Guzman 
(Miguel 
Bernardeau), 
who is passed out drunk. The first 
two situations were presented 
as something that wasn’t okay 
and that Polo had to answer for, 
and the third was used more as 
a scandalous foreshadowing tool 
for a dynamic between the three 
that would slowly unfold over the 
course of season two. Without 
spoiling anything, Polo’s sexual 
behavior can easily be seen as a tie 
in to his violent and sociopathic 
tendencies, and his actions are 
by no means put on a pedestal by 
the show, but I have complicated 
feelings about the intersection 
between budding queerness and 
violation being treated so often as 
an easy access point in seemingly 
progressive storytelling.
For 
one 
thing, 
the 
show 
brings up some very meaningful 
conversations around what consent 
means and what it means to violate 
it. Across the board, the show very 
aptly colors in several shades of 
gray in what is often treated as a 
subject involving only extremes. 
Sexual assault is usually portrayed 
as an overwhelming display of 
physical violence, or as the old, 
powerful boss attempting to coerce 
the new, unsuspecting employee, 
and not as something that can 
happen between people who know 
each other well, in a way that 

involves more subtle methods of 
coercion, coming from people that 
might not understand (and, often 
times not be willing to understand) 
that what they’re doing is harmful. 
The show goes a long way to show 
that people have to learn how to ask 
for it and give it, to set boundaries, 
that it can take people time to 
realize that their consent has been 
violated, and that bringing it up 
can be even more difficult when 
the playing field isn’t even. Taking 
an extremely sensitive topic and 
showing how a conflict regarding it 
might play out in a youth-oriented 
context is sure to help create 
internal dialogues about how it 
might apply to one’s life in a way 
that is, well, groundbreaking. 
Any form of media that has the 
smallest 
potential 
of 
helping 
people advocate for themselves or, 
conversely, reflect on their actions 
with that subject matter is one I 
eagerly support.
Yet, my issue stems from the fact 
that there are very few narratives 
revolving around queer sex that 
don’t involve an all encompassing 
kind of existential pain, let alone 
some kind of violation of consent, 
either contained within the act 
itself or by who has knowledge 
of it. Even in Modern Family, 
often considered a marvel of 
social engineering for essentially 
sanitizing a queer relationship 
through the lens of an American 
nuclear family, only ever hinted at 
their two gay characters, Cam (Eric 
Stonestreet) and Mitchell (Jesse 
Tyler Ferguson), having sex on one 
occasion when they were being 
walked in on by Cam’s parents 
(which, if I remember correctly, 
was a point of contention in the 
episode). In Gossip Girl, the most 
noteworthy on-screen kiss was the 
result of Blair (Leighton Meester)’s 
scheming, 
manipulating 
her 
boyfriend, Chuck (Ed Westwick) 
into kissing a faculty member 
of NYU without his express 
knowledge. The only other same 
sex kiss in the show was in an 
episode that treated public outing 
as a punch line.

‘M’ snaps skid, beats Badgers 68-56

After Sunday’s blowout loss 
to 
Maryland, 
the 
Michigan 
women’s basketball team needed 
to bounce back strong. Thursday 
night against Wisconsin, the 
Wolverines did just that.
Michigan (12-5 overall, 3-3 Big 
Ten) came out fast, scoring nine 
points in the first two minutes 
and jumping out to an early 
seven-point lead as the Badgers 
(9-8, 1-5) had trouble defending 
the Wolverines’ biggest threats. 
Sophomore point guard Amy 
Dilk — coming off two games 
in which she shot a combined 
4-for-25 and turned the ball over 
often — was vital to the start, 
making Michigan’s first basket, 
assisting on another and grabbing 
a rebound.
A Wisconsin timeout slowed 
the 
Wolverines’ 
offensive 
momentum, but they locked 
down 
defensively. 
Michigan 
didn’t force many turnovers, but 
the Wolverines prevented the 
Badgers from getting the ball 
in the paint and forced them to 
take contested outside jumpers. 
Wisconsin shot just 4-for-14 in 
the first quarter and only scored 
eight points.
Michigan’s offense struggled 
at the beginning of the second 

quarter — scoring just two points 
in the first three minutes — but yet 
again, its stout defense kept the 
Badgers from coming back. Just 
as Wisconsin’s offense started to 
gain some momentum with two 
baskets in three possessions over 
a minute, sophomore forward 
Naz Hillmon found her rhythm.
Hillmon, after being held to 
just two points on 1-of-4 shooting 
in the first quarter, scored nine 
in the final seven minutes of the 
second, leading the Wolverines 
to a 16-point halftime lead. She 
finished with 21 points and 14 
rebounds. Dilk added four of her 
12 points in this stretch.
“Naz seemed like she had a 
little bit of a slow start and then 
you look at the end of the game, 
and she was incredible again,” 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico said on a postgame radio 
show. “(She) is a rebounding 
machine.”
The 
Wolverines’ 
defense 
struggled a bit in the second half, 
though, allowing the Badgers to 
shoot 52 percent after shooting 
just 31 percent in the first half, but 
their offense continued to click. 
They got the ball into the paint for 
high-quality chances and often 
got to the line, where they were 
10-for-10 in the half. Michigan 
led by 19 with four minutes left 
when Wisconsin ended the game 

on an 11-4 run to finish with 
only a 12-point deficit —most of 
which came with the Wolverines’ 
reserves in the game.
Rebounding was key to the 
Wolverines’ 
strong 
offensive 
performance, with Hillmon at the 
forefront. In three of Michigan’s 
five losses, the Wolverines have 
been 
outrebounded 
by 
their 
opponents. With a starting five 
consisting of players all 6-foot 
or taller, and not many 3-point 
shooting threats on the roster, 
outrebounding 
opponents 
and 
getting 
second-chance 
opportunities has been crucial 
for Michigan. Thursday, the 
Wolverines grabbed 48 rebounds 
— 22 offensive — compared to the 
Badgers’ 23, and scored 27 second 
chance points.
“I thought we were awesome 
on the offensive glass,” Barnes 
Arico said. “Obviously we can 
count on Naz every night to 
really offensive rebound. But 
Kayla Robbins was tremendous 
on the glass, as was AK and Amy 
Dilk. We just had a motor to the 
basketball tonight and that was 
great to see.”
This game came at just the right 
time for Michigan. Wisconsin is 
one of the weakest teams in the 
Big Ten, allowing the Wolverines 
to gain some confidence and pick 
up their first conference road win. 

Michigan readies for Garza rematch

On Dec. 6, Iowa center Luka 
Garza marched into Ann Arbor 
and dropped 44 points.
Forty. Four.
Perhaps 
even 
more 
astounding, though, was that 
his team lost — by double digits.
Regardless of the outcome, 
there is no chance Michigan 
men’s basketball coach Juwan 
Howard is happy with letting 
any human being score 44 
points on his team.
So that leads to one big 
question heading into Friday’s 
match against the Hawkeyes: 
Should the Wolverines continue 
their 
defensive 
strategy 
of 
maintaining 
one-on-one 
matchups, or is it time to 
double the post and one of the 
nation’s most prolific scorers? 
That description is not an 
overstatement — Garza sits as 
the NCAA’s sixth-leading scorer 
with 22.3 points per game.
For 
now, 
it 
seems 
that 
Michigan will look to maintain 
its defensive scheme — involving 
guarding the low post one-on-
one — and to trust the strength 
of its big men on defense to limit 
Garza in the points column.
For 
many 
teams 
across 
the nation, thinking of a way 
to effectively prepare for a 
6-foot-11 elite scorer may leave 
coaches 
and 
players 
alike 
scratching their head. But for 
the 
Wolverines, 
with 
their 
plethora of big-bodied centers, 
the task falls on the shoulders of 
its scout team. Junior forward 
Jaron Faulds, in particular.
“We got Jaron Faulds playing 
Luka 
Garza,” 
junior 
walk-
on forward C.J. Baird said. 
“Jaron’s really good at taking 
his time and getting in good 
positioning, so we’re hoping 
that’s a good imitation of Garza. 
Cause Garza’s elite at getting 
his body, getting position in 
the post and scoring, so we’re 
trying to imitate that as best we 
can, but honestly, it’s hard. He’s, 

I don’t know, number six scorer 
in the country. So it’ll be a good 
challenge for us.”
How effective Faulds will 
be at this game of impressions 
will unfold on Friday in Iowa 
City. 
Faulds’ 
impersonation, 
combined with the defensive 
capabilities of senior center Jon 
Teske, sophomore center Colin 
Castleton and senior center 
Austin Davis as well as how 
many fouls these players will 
commit against the shifty Garza 
will dictate whether or not 
Garza will have another career 
night down low.
So far this season, early foul 
trouble and hacking opponents 
down 
low 
has 
been 
the 
Wolverines’ defensive “MO.” In 
no game was this emphasized 
further than the most loss on 
the road against Minnesota. 
The team committed 19 fouls, 
emphasized by four by Teske, 
and let Golden Gophers center 
Daniel Oturu drop 30 points.
Baird insists that fouling 
has been a focus for the team, 
defensively, as well as one-on-
one situations, given the team’s 
defensive sets.
“Guarding 
one-on-one 
without fouling is probably one 
of the hardest things to do in 
basketball, and I’d say, in my 
opinion, in the post as well, 
it’s probably one of the hardest 
things to do in basketball,” 
Baird said. “But there are some 
things that you can do with, 

technique-wise, that you can 
say look at this technique, this 
will help you in this situation. 
Or make sure you keep your 
foot planted here and stay down 
on a second jumper so you’re 
not fouling. There are a lot of 
stuff that goes with technique, 
especially in the one on one 
defense, that you can improve 
upon rather than just saying, 
‘Be better.’ ”
And if the technique doesn’t 
work, it sounds like Howard 
is relatively fine letting Garza 
getting 
those 
touches 
and 
points in the paint. As long as 
that plan of attack ends in a 
victory.
After Michigan’s last game 
against Iowa, Howard sat down 
at the podium, stat sheet in 
hand, and visibly revealed his 
shock at what he was reading. 
The first-year coach was floored 
by the opposing offense and 
joked about his role in the affair.
“Second-chance 
points,” 
Howard responded when asked 
what shocked him. “(Garza) 
had 27 second-chance points, 
and then points in the paint, 
56. I was like, ‘Wow!’ That’s on 
the coach, man. I did a horrible 
job.”
Joking or not, Friday’s game 
will be as credible an indicator 
as any of whether Howard’s 
defensive gameplan is reliable, 
or makes as brazen of a 
comment as his own as to the 
state of his coaching.

Wojcik leads comeback

As Evianna Roberson climbed 
onto the beam, she received the 
full attention of all in attendance at 
Crisler Center. Her performance 
was the last of the meet, and with 
a perfect score, she would force a 
tie between her No. 17 Washington 
and the No. 6 Michigan women’s 
gymnastics teams. 
The lead margin throughout the 
first two rotations of last Friday’s 
meet 
had 
been 
consistently 
microscopic in favor of the 
Wolverines. But Michigan ran 
into trouble in its third rotation, 
the beam, allowing the Huskies 
to move into first place and 
Texas Woman’s 
University 
to 
make up ground. 
“Quite 
honestly 
I 
was 
very 
disappointed, 
very 
disappointed 
with 
beam,” 
Michigan coach 
Bev Plocki said. 
“... We still have a 
lot of work to do.”
The half-point deduction from 
sophomore Natalie Wojcik’s fall 
was symptomatic of an event 
performed at a lower quality than 
the vault and bars. A team score of 
48.100 on beam was nearly a full 
point lower than that of any other 
event.
The onus fell on the Wolverines’ 
floor gymnasts to reclaim the lead, 
and while not all were aware of 
the score, the necessity of ending 

on a high note after a subpar beam 
was unanimously felt. 
“Bev had us circle up and she 
was like, ‘Let’s do floor like we’re 
on a mission,’ ” freshman Gabby 
Wilson said. 
Plocki encouraged her team to 
control its own destiny.
“My mindset is never really 
anything to do with the other 
team,” Plocki said. “My mindset 
is we need to entertain this crowd, 
and we need to rock and roll here 
on floor.”
That’s exactly what Michigan 
did. It was the only squad that 
posted more than 49 points on 
floor, led by a 9.900 from Wojcik; 
after handing over the lead on 
beam, she helped engineer the 
effort to reclaim 
it.
“It was good to 
kind of reset and 
look at floor as a 
new opportunity, 
and try not to 
let beam affect 
what happened,” 
Wojcik said. “I 
knew I had to 
keep going, push 
forward 
and 
finish 
out 
the 
meet strong.”
Roberson could not achieve 
perfection, leaving the Wolverines 
with a comeback victory. But for 
Plocki, not all wins are created 
equal.
“When you’re satisfied, you’re 
done, because somebody is doing 
better,” Plocki said. “This team 
is capable of being a 49.5 on any 
event. And so you can see where 
we still have room to improve.”

Lambert focuses on improving defensive habits

Jimmy Lambert remained 
on the ice.
Long finished was practice, 
players had come in, completed 
their drills and left thereafer.
Long gone were the coaches, 
who hurried off the ice to prep 
for the Michigan hockey team’s 
upcoming matchup.
But the sophomore forward 
was far from done.
He worked on shooting, 
rifling shots into the empty 
net. When he ran out of pucks, 
he collected them back up, and 
went again. And again. And 
again. Sometimes he’d spend 
up to 30 extra minutes on the 
ice, just firing the puck on 
target.
If you look at Lambert’s 
numbers, it’s clear why he’s 
putting in extra time.
He only has one goal this 
season, and he scored it almost 
three months ago. With just 
four total points, he’s tied for 
eighth on the team. Last year, 
he led the freshman class 
with 11. His name hasn’t been 
featured on the scoresheet 
since assisting on an empty net 
goal against Wisconsin on Dec. 
1.
Lambert’s 
offensive 

statistics are emblematic of 
how the first half of the season 
went for the Wolverines: rough.
“Obviously the puck hasn’t 
gone in as much as I’d hoped,” 
Lambert said. “But when it 
doesn’t go in the net you’ve got 
to contribute in other ways.”
And that’s exactly what he’s 
done.
During 
the 
middle 
of 
November, Lambert switched 
positions from 
right wing to 
center. 
While 
not a transition 
he’d 
been 
anticipating, 
the 
Michigan 
coaches 
made 
sure 
their 

forwards 
were prepared 
to 
play 
in 
whatever 
role 
the team called 
upon them to play. Despite this 
expectation, having the trust 
of the coaches to fill a gap in 
the lineup gave Lambert the 
confidence boost he’d been in 
search of.
With a new role and a 
scoring slump, he decided to 
focus on the aspects of his 
game he could control. His 
backchecking and forechecking 
habits, faceoffs and ability to 

set up opportunities for his 
teammates.
“I think I made a lot of 
improvements in my game 
defensively,” Lambert said. “I 
think I’ve done a good job in 
the D-zone winning draws. I 
recently played on the penalty 
kill. Think it’s been good, 
really the only thing that could 
go a little better is scoring 
some goals.”
Last weekend 
at then-No. 14 
Notre 
Dame, 
with 
the 
Wolverines 
leaving 
a 
prominent 
penalty 
killer 
in 
Dakota 
Raabe 
home 
in Ann Arbor, 
Lambert 
saw 
significant 
ice 
time on the man 
disadvantage. 
Prior 
to 
the 
Great Lakes Invitational (GLI), 
he’d seen little to no time 
killing penalties. But in South 
Bend, he fit in seamlessly on 
the unit. He was getting his 
stick in passing lanes, taking 
away angles, even blocking 
shots.
In the circle, he’s been 
averaging just over 50 percent 
on faceoffs with 68 won and 66 

lost. Some of Lambert’s success 
on faceoffs can be credited to 
a new strategy Michigan has 
been using since the GLI — 
watching their opponents take 
draws.
“It’s always good when you 
can have a little bit of an edge 
on the opponent,” Lambert 
said. “Being able to watch all 
four of their centers, and the 
guys that go in when they get 
kicked out. Just being able to 
know what they do. It’s really 
good for us to have a plan going 
into each faceoff.”
This weekend, as Lambert 
and his teammates turn their 
attention towards the sixth-
ranked 
Nittany 
Lions, 
his 
defensive improvements will 
be beneficial.
Penn 
State’s 
offense 
is 
tied for second in the NCAA, 
averaging 4.00 goals per game 
while the Wolverines sit at 
44th with an average of 2.32. 
While 
Michigan’s 
scoring 
numbers, much like Lambert’s, 
aren’t overly promising, the 
team’s defense is solid.
Allowing just 2.05 goals per 
game on average, Michigan’s 
defense is ranked fifth. With 
that in mind, the key to this 
pivotal series for both Lambert 
and the Wolverines will be 
what they do without the 
puck — with Lambert noting 
that the most crucial aspect 
of the weekend is to play solid 
defense.
“One 
way 
to 
keep 
the 
number-one scoring team off 
the scoresheet is by playing 
offense ourselves,” Lambert 
said. “And keeping them in 
their own end. If we can be 
heavy on them in the forecheck 
and get pucks in deep and just 
be relentless all night, I think 
we should have a pretty good 
weekend.”
Coming off a weekend road 
sweep of the Fighting Irish 
that catapulted it out of last 
place in the Big Ten Conference 
standings, Michigan has an 
opportunity to prove itself. Its 
success will depend largely on 
Lambert and the rest of the 
team to make strong defensive 
plays, especially if the offensive 
woes of the first half creep in.

Sophomore guard Amy Dilk scored 12 points with six rebounds as Michigan beat Wisconsin on Thursday night.


 There is no shortage of tangible measures by which Michigan football’s offense improved drastically over 
the course of the season. It turned the ball over less, scored more points, won more games and did so more 
convincingly. That’s the what. Offensive coordinator Josh Gattis’ growth, though, can be seen in the how. 
 None more so than the usage of Giles Jackson.
 Jackson, a receiver who just finished his freshman season, possesses a skillset tailor-made to Gattis’. He’s 
5-foot-9, speedy and athletic. Before Gattis found a consistent role for him in the offense, Jackson contributed 
as a kick returner, and it’s hard to imagine he won’t return to the role in 2020.
 Jackson won’t beat defenders with physicality or technique — at least not right now, a year into his college 
football career. He’ll beat them in the open field, by juking guys out of their shoes, or just being faster.
 Defenses must account for Jackson everywhere on the field. Once the Wolverines came to realize that, 
they started lining him up in different spots and putting him in as much space as they could, stressing 
opposing defenses to their breaking point.
 Early in a win over Michigan State, the Wolverines lined up in a tight formation and saw the 
Spartans show zone coverage pre-snap. Jackson lines up on the boundary, with the field-side 
receiver running vertical and occupying the corner. Michigan runs a split-zone look, with 
quarterback Shea Patterson faking the handoff and Jackson darting around the edge to take it 
instead. Tight end Sean McKeon arcs around the edge defender instead of blocking him, giving 
Jackson a convoy to the open field if he can turn the corner past a bigger, slower Kenny Willekes.
 Spoiler: He can.
 Later in the same game, Michigan runs Jackson on an end around again, but this time from a 
spread formation, against man coverage with no window dressing to make it look any different. 
Doesn’t matter.
 Anytime the Wolverines make it a contest between Jackson and an edge defender, Jackson’s 
going to win.
 “Every time he touches the ball, I think he’s gonna score,” sophomore linebacker Cam 
McGrone said after Michigan’s Citrus Bowl loss against Alabama. “He has that explosive-play 
capability, and he makes something happen with the ball every time he touches it.”
 By then, the Wolverines had regularly started putting Jackson in the backfield pre-snap, with 
only good things to show for it.
 Against the Crimson Tide, Jackson finished with a season-high four receptions for 57 yards, 
including a 40-yard catch. On that play, Jackson lined up in the backfield and Michigan sent slot 
receiver Mike Sainristil in motion, an Alabama defensive back following and indicating man coverage.
 That meant a linebacker would be covering Jackson — a mismatch of seismic proportions. Patterson 
faked a handoff. Jackson sprinted upfield on a wheel route, giving the linebacker no chance to turn his 
hips, easily gaining five full yards of separation. The throw hit Jackson in stride and he kept going after 
the catch.
 It’s reminiscent of another explosive play Jackson hit two games prior, at Indiana. 
Just the same way, Michigan lined up pre-snap with Jackson in the backfield 
and saw man coverage. They faked a handoff and the Hoosier 
linebacker assigned to cover Jackson took a step forward, making 
an already-lopsided matchup that much easier.
 Then it was just Jackson, upfield all by himself.
 By the time Michigan had a handle on Jackson’s usage 
in 2019, it was too late to seriously impact the outcome 
of games. Even with that explosive play against 
Alabama and a touchdown against Ohio State, 
Jackson finished the year with just 19 touches on 
offense, for a total of 211 yards. There are areas 
of his game — route-running in particular — that 
will benefit from an offseason of work.
 In 2020, Jackson will be a fulcrum of the 
offense, part by design and part by necessity. 
After Donovan Peoples-Jones’ departure for 
the NFL, Jackson will be in line for more 
snaps, along with Cornelius Johnson and Mike 
Sainristil. What’s yet unclear is whether the 
Wolverines see him long-term as a slot receiver 
or an H-back. Based on how they used him 
towards the end of this season, it may be the 
latter.
 “Giles is a real ascending player,” Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh said after the Citrus Bowl. 
“... He’s a true freshman, so I didn’t know exactly 
what you’re going to have in a true freshman, but 
he has really produced and had a heck of a year.
 “... Can’t say enough good things about him.”
