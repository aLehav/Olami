The Ann Arbor City Council 
voted 
to 
terminate 
City 
Administrator Howard Lazarus 
without 
cause 
on 
Tuesday 
night, effective Feb. 29. 
The 
resolution 
to 
fire 
Lazarus, 
sponsored 
by 
Councilmembers Jack Eaton, 
D-Ward 4, and Jane Lumm, 
I-Ward 2, passed with a 7-4 
vote. The resolution approves 

a 
separation 
and 
release 
agreement 
guaranteeing 
a 
severance of one year’s salary, 
amounting to $223,600, and an 
additional lump sum of $1,000. 
The agreement also states that 
neither Lazarus nor the city will 
disparage or make comments 
that reflect negatively upon the 
other party.
Lazarus opened the meeting 
with a statement reflecting on 
his almost four years serving as 
Ann Arbor’s city administrator. 
He thanked the council and 

community members for the 
opportunity to serve and spoke 
about what he believes to be the 
four pillars of public service: 
purpose, respect, health and 
joy.
“We’ve accomplished many 
significant efforts; in addition 
to preserving and protecting 
the 
tremendous 
quality 
of 
life that we have in Ann 
Arbor, much of what we do 
is unnoticed, and that is the 
nature of the job we’ve chosen,” 
Lazarus said. “We may also 

never know the extent to which 
we positively impact the lives of 
people in our community.”
During 
public 
comment, 
multiple Ann Arbor residents 
addressed the upcoming vote 
on 
Lazarus’s 
termination. 
Dan Michniewicz, a candidate 
for City Council to represent 
Ward 5, said the firing was 
motivated by politics rather 
than motivated by concern for 
the public good. 

U.S. 
Rep. 
Debbie 
Dingell, 
D-Mich., 
Ann 
Arbor 
Mayor 
Christopher Taylor and multiple 
Ann Arbor City Council members 
gathered 
on 
Tuesday 
for 
a 
Representative Roundtable hosted 
by the University of Michigan 
Central Student Government. 
CSG President Ben Gerstein, 
Public Policy junior, introduced 
the panelists and led the panel 

with 
a 
series 
of 
questions 
regarding 
student 
involvement 
in the November 2020 elections. 
Approximately 
25 
people 
participated in the interactive Q&A 
session with the politicians in the 
Michigan Union.
Dingell 
touched 
on 
the 
importance of voting and praised 
the Big Ten Voting Competition 
from 2018, reiterating the impact 
that voting can make.
“I’ve just talked to most of you 
about a lot of issues you care about,” 
Dingell said. “Your vote makes 

a difference. President Trump 
won this state by a very narrow 
margin of the popular vote. If more 
students had voted … it might have 
made a difference, and people need 
to know your vote matters.”
In anticipation of the November 
elections, panelists described what 
they are doing to mobilize student 
voters. Taylor discussed ways 
college students can vote, including 
absentee ballots and additional 
voting locations to make voting 
more convenient for students.
“Our goal is to also have 

on-campus locations where we 
can have staff members there to 
provide in-person, absentee access 
for student voters for weeks in 
advance of the election,” Taylor 
said. “Our goal is to enhance 
the student vote this November, 
just from the municipal side, 
communicate absentee, in-person 
absentee 
… 
make 
sure 
that 
students know that that’s going to 
be available on campus and then 
increase throughput at precincts.”
Most cooks discard pepper 
tops and stems as unusable 
food 
scraps. 
For 
campus 
chefs 
Russ 
Palmer, 
Tony 
Picinotti and Frank Turchan, 
however, these scraps had 
hidden potential to become 
hummus served at a buffet 
dinner Tuesday night. 
The 
WasteLESS 
event 
featured 
dishes 
with 
recycled 
ingredients 
and 
a panel to inform roughly 
40 
attendees 
on 
food 
waste 
and 
preventative 
practices. 
According 
to 
Claire 
Prenevost, 
Planet 
Blue 
Student 
Leader 
and 
LSA senior, the event was a 
joint collaboration between 
MDining, Planet Blue Student 
Leaders and the University of 
Michigan Sustainable Food 
Program. 
“It’s really just a natural 
pairing of people being able 
to sit down and then gain 
more in-depth information 
from people that have more 
experience in their career and 
personal 
lives,” 
Prenevost 
said. “Then (they will) be able 
to take that information and, 
as consumers, apply it in their 
everyday lives.”

After the City of Ann Arbor 
placed Police Chief Michael 
Cox on administrative leave 
earlier 
this 
month, 
the 
Independent 
Community 
Police Oversight Commission 
hosted a community forum 
to 
discuss 
Cox’s 
leave. 
Approximately 50 community 
members and city leaders 
attended 
the 
meeting 
on 
Tuesday night in Ann Arbor 
City Hall. 
Commission 
Chair 
Lisa 
Jackson began the meeting 
with a statement about the 
situation, noting the lack 
of public information. She 
confirmed 
Cox 
was 
not 
placed on leave as a result 
of any sexual harassment-
related claim. Jackson said 
the 
investigation 
should 
conclude 
Thursday 
and 
the 
ICPOC 
will 
hold 
a 
special committee meeting 
sometime at the end of the 
week to update the public 
and allow for comments and 
questions. 
Many community members 
commented on the damage 
done to Cox’s public image by 
being placed on leave.

Suzanne 
Anglewicz, 
research 
attorney 
for 
the 
Institute 
for 
Legislative 
Action division of the National 
Rifle Association, began her 
seminar 
by 
acknowledging 
opposition to the NRA on 
college campuses: “Disagree 
with us, but at least disagree 
with us on the facts.”
On 
Tuesday 
night, 
the 
University’s chapter of College 
Republicans hosted a seminar 
in partnership with Anglewicz 
to discuss the NRA, gun 
control debate and the Second 
Amendment. 
NRA 
University, 
an 
interactive 
presentation 
on 
gun rights, was founded in 
2008. Anglewicz said NRA 
U’s mission is to educate 
college youth on the gun 
control debate and Second 
Amendment, 
as 
well 
as 
clarify misinformation about 

the NRA. About 45 students 
gathered in the Michigan 
League to hear Anglewicz’s 
presentation. 
The NRA currently has 
nearly five million members. 
Anglewicz 
addressed 
the 
distinction 
between 
the 
lobbying body of the NRA and 
the rest of the NRA’s work 
with education and safety 
training. Anglewicz said the 
NRA annually trains more 
than one million civilians 
about gun safety and has 
more than 125,000 firearm 
instructors nationwide. 
“We are not the lobby 
for gun manufacturers and 
dealers,” Anglewicz said. “We 
are a non-profit, civil rights 
organization 
that 
serves 
people.” 

While 
Anglewicz 

highlighted 
the 
education 
efforts by the NRA, political 
lobbying by the NRA has been 
at the forefront of national 
news.

The 
University 
of 
Michigan Central Student 
Government 
convened 
in 
the 
Michigan 
Union 
Tuesday night to discuss 
allocations of Legislative 
Discretionary funding, to 
confirm new roles and to 
amend the election code. 
The 
Assembly 
began 
with 
deliberations 
on 
allocating a fund of $5,645 
for 
performing 
Macbeth 
in the Union courtyard. 
Music, Theatre & Dance 
representative 
Zion 
Jackson advocated for the 
resolution.
“The reason we are doing 
this is because we feel that 
theatre is an integral part 
of the American lifestyle, 
and I feel that theatre 
has power in connecting 
people,” Jackson said. “This 
Shakespeare play does a lot 
of that. It has a lot of themes 
(that) are very political, not 
in a bad sense, but it shines 
a light on different topics of 
today.”
LSA 
representative 
Maddi Walsh, on the other 
hand, was concerned about 
the cost required for this 
production.
“We 
don’t 
have 
any 
way 
of 
really 
knowing 
concretely what the value 
that we are getting out of 
(the production) is,” Walsh 
said. “We don’t really know 
aside from just projections 
from past productions what 
our return on investments 
is going to be and whether 
it is going to be similar or 
not.”
In response to Walsh’s 
concerns, 
Jackson 
recognized the production 
is a risk financially, but 
also creates an opportunity 
for CSG to build a stronger 

relationship 
with 
the 
School of Music, Theatre & 
Dance.
“I know it’s a risk. It’s 
very risky and that we 
don’t 
know 
the 
actual 
return on investment and 
such, but I also feel like 
with something like this 
we won’t know unless we 
try,” Jackson said. “There 
haven’t been any efforts, at 
least to my knowledge, any 
concrete or solid efforts 
for us to try to establish a 
better relationship with the 
School of Music, Theatre & 
Dance, and so I feel like this 
is a method to do that.”
After 
a 
vote, 
the 
resolution 
was 
referred 
to 
the 
Resolutions 
and 
Finances Committee due 
to concerns regarding the 
large fund needed. 
The 
Assembly 
then 
confirmed LSA sophomore 
Brendan Neary as vice-chair 
of the Student Organization 
Funding Committee. Last 
semester, LSA junior and 
SOFC vice-chair Max Jones 
was recalled for application 
misconduct.
LSA 
freshman 
Kyla 
McCallum 
was 
also 
confirmed as chief of staff. 
McCallum 
will 
succeed 
Public 
Policy 
junior 
Amanda 
Kaplan, 
who 
announced her candidacy 
for CSG President with the 
Mobilize 
party 
Monday 
night. 
The Assembly approved 
a resolution to create a 
Student 
Organization 
Committee 
to 
improve 
CSG’s 
relationship 
with 
student 
organizations 
and relieve the workload 
on 
SOFC, 
which 
is 
currently responsible for 
enforcing CSG regulations 
and 
managing 
student 
organization funding. 
The committee will be 
led by a director who will 

manage 
communication 
with student organizations, 
funding and enforcement of 
rules. SOC will also manage 
other student organization 
operations 
that 
are 
not 
related 
to 
funding 
but 
impact student life. 
The 
Assembly 
also 
reached 
a 
decision 
to 
remove the BIT Liaison, 
who 
oversees 
SOFC’s 
Bystander 
Intervention 
Training 
Liaison, 
and 
redirect the responsibilities 
of the liaison to the Sexual 
Misconduct Prevention and 
Survivor 
Empowerment 
Commission. It was also 
decided that the Bystander 
Intervention Training will 
be converted to an online 
course. 
The Assembly discussed 
proposed 
amendments 
to 
the 
election code. Engineering 
representatives 
Zeke 
Majeske and Carla Voigt 
and 
LSA 
representative 
Sam 
Braden 
advocated 
for 
banning 
political 
parties. The group said 
that currently, parties seek 
out 
popular 
candidates 
who have the ability to get 
numbers.
Additionally, the group 
said there is a lack of 
information on ways to 
participate 
in 
CSG 
due 
to the fact that students 
usually learn about CSG 
only 
during 
election 
season. They said the party 
system further discourages 
individual candidates from 
contesting 
party 
picks 
for 
seats 
and 
prevents 
candidates from winning 
because 
of 
their 
party 
affiliation.
They also pointed out 
the 
financial 
burden 
on 
candidates 
who 
run 
without a party, saying they 
are delegated significantly 
lower 
funds 
when 
campaigning. 

CSG 
Speaker 
Whit 
Froehlich 
ruled 
this 
amendment out of order 
on the grounds that it was 
unconstitutional. However, 
the group said even if their 
proposal does not argue the 
unconstitutionality of the 
current system, it is still 
unfair.
The 
Assembly 
then 
engaged 
in 
a 
debate 
regarding the revocation of 
Froehlich’s ruling. Majeske 
withdrew the resolution.
The 
same 
group 
proposed another set of 
amendments 
that 
would 
allow students to campaign 
with other candidates, but 
would prevent them from 
campaigning under a single 
party name and putting a 
party name on the ballot. 
Froehlich ruled this set of 
proposed amendments out 
of order. 
The 
Assembly 
then 
debated the group’s third 
set of amendments. The 
Assembly voted to pass 
the sets of amendments, 
which bans party names 
on the ballot and prevents 
candidates from spending 
money on other candidates.
CSG Vice Speaker Selena 
Bazzi advocated for the 
amendments, 
saying 
she 
felt that candidates running 
with parties have an unfair 
advantage over individual 
candidates.
“When I first ran for CSG 
with MomentUM against 
MVision, I felt like I was 
chasing after everyone to 
vote for me, and even then I 
barely made it,” Bazzi said. 
“When I ran with Engage, 
I barely had to campaign, 
and I was on top. I feel like 
parties matter a lot.”

Three representatives present amendments to adjust role of parties in student government elections

Central Student Government discusses 
election parties, performance funding

Feb. 19, 1975: ‘U’ to destroy some student files

The literary college (LSA) plans 
to destroy portions of student 
counseling 
records, 
according 
to 
Charles 
Morris, 
associate 
dean of LSA. The material to be 
removed consists of letters of 
recommendation written mainly 
by high school counselors, which 
have been forwarded from the 
admissions office to the LSA 
counseling office.
Morris 
reported 
that 
Vice 
President for Academic Affairs 
Frank Rhodes told him last week 
that the letters of recommendation 
could not be made available to 
students.
HOWEVER, because the LSA 
Administrative Board, which has 

final decision-making authority 
over LSA counseling offices, had 
earlier declared that all material 
in students’ files should be made 
available to the students, Morris 
said there is no option now 
available to the board except 
removal of the files in question.
Morris stated that “the feeling 
of the board is that if the material 
is not accessible to the student, 
it should not be accessible to 
anyone.” He stressed that the 
decision to destroy the material 
was something that they had been 
forced to do, not something of 
which he personally approved.
Nevertheless, 
Rhodes 
had 
stated last term that he would 

be “appalled” by destruction of 
files, and that the administration 
strongly opposed such a move. 
Rhodes 
was 
unavailable 
for 
comment last night.
HOWEVER, 
Edward 
Dougherty, assistant to Rhodes, 
contends that “the statement last 
term (opposing destruction of the 
records) was not made for ever 
and ever.”
Ernest Zimmerman, another 
assistant toRhodes, stated that 
“we did not ask the Administrative 
Board to do that (destroy files). 
They are at liberty to remove 
them; it’s their decision at this 
point.”
The move to destroy student 

records was prompted by a new 
federal law that allows students to 
see almost all the material in their 
counseling files. However, letters 
of recommendation to admissions 
offices written prior to January 
1, 1974 (with the understanding 
that the contents were to remain 
in confidence), may remain secret.
ZIMMERMAN 
argued 
that 
“the law provides that those 
letters submitted prior to January 
1 are confidential and should 
remain as such.”
However, another clause in the 
law, the Family Education Rights 
and Privacy Act of 1974, also states 
that recommendations used for 
purposes other than their original 

intent – namely admissions – may 
be made available to the subject. 
Morris contended that the 
files should be made available 
for that because of this clause; 
in fact, he had sent a letter last 
month to Zimmerman explaining 
that he intended to make the 
files completely open “unless we 
receive a contrary directive from 
the University.” That directive 
came from Rhodes last week in 
the letter that asked Morris to 
keep the files secret. 
According to Morris, “where 
the LSA administrative board and 
the 
University 
administration 
disagree clearly is in regards to 
their definition of that clause.”

“The University position was 
that making the files available 
would be a violation of the high 
school counselors’ rights,” Morris 
stated.
Morris said that the LSA board 
was then faced with a dilemma 
when Rhodes instructed that the 
letters remain secret – and the 
board was left with no choice but 
destruction of the files. Morris 
said that a consensus decision of 
the board was reached earlier this 
week.
Morris also explained that 
removal of the records would take 
some six months, and could be 
considerably expensive.

RUCHITA IYER/Daily
Members of Central Student Government listen to student proposals at their weekly assembly meeting in the Union Tuesday evening.


The 
panel 
then 
discussed 
college 
affordability 
and 
its 
impact on students at the 
University. Benji Timpf, 
regional 
coordinator 
for 
U.S. 
Sen. 
Gary 
Peters, 
stressed 
the 
senator’s focus on college 
affordability.
“The 
Senator 
has 
been doing work to hold 
the Department of Ed 
accountable 
to 
ensure 
that the loans students 
are receiving, they know 
the conditions of those 
loans,” Tim said. “The 
Senator has been pushing 
to hold the Department of 
Ed accountable, increase 
the availability of those 
programs’ work … (and) 
making 
Department 
of Ed more accessible 
and 
understandable 
to 
students.”
City Council members 
weighed in on housing 
affordability 
and 
efforts to address the 
issue. 
Councilmember 
Zachary 
Ackerman, 
D-Ward 3, discussed the 
disparity 
between 
the 
10,000-person 
increase 
in University enrollment 
and the 6,000-bedroom 
increase in housing.
“That 
doesn’t 
quite 
add up,” Ackerman said. 
“Simple 
math 
tells 
us 
there’s an imbalance. We 
have a supply issue. So, 
we need to address supply 
by building new housing.”
Ackerman 
said 
City 
Council 
is 
working 
on 
zoning 
rules 
and 
increased incentives for 

building. The council is 
also looking into building 
on land already owned by 
the municipality as well 
as regulating the market 
of 
short-term 
rental 
properties.
Councilmember 
Julie Grand, D-Ward 3, 
suggested 
thinking 
of 
campus affordability in 
relation 
to 
community 
affordability.
“One way to reframe 
the 
issues 
is 
that 
a 
lot of issues that are 
important to affordability 
are 
important 
for 
our 
community 
more 
broadly,” 
Grand 
said. 
“Sometimes 
we 
put 
student 
issues 
in 
this 
bubble where they really 
don’t 
belong 
because 
you’re a really important 
part of our community. … 
What’s good for students 
is what’s good for our 
community.”
Following a question 
from 
the 
audience 
regarding divisiveness in 
public discourse, Dingell 
addressed her role in this 
and her interactions with 
President Donald Trump 
via social media.
“I think the biggest 
fear to our democracy is 
the hatred and division in 
this country right now,” 
Dingell said. “I have seen 
hatred and vitriol and 
some of the worst rhetoric 
you can ever imagine. It’s 
simply not okay.”
Dingell, whose husband 
John Dingell passed away 
last February, said she 
plans to collaborate with 
Cindy McCain, the widow 
of Senator John McCain, 
for a tour centered around 
civility.
“We 
were 
both 

married 
to 
great 
men 
and 
heroes 
that 
we 
loved, and we’re going 
to talk about civility,” 
Dingell said. “You’re all 
communicators. You have 
to tell people it’s not okay. 
We have to stand up to the 
hatred in this country.”
In 
response 
to 
a 
question 
from 
the 
audience 
regarding 
health 
care, 
Dingell 
reinforced her message 
on 
the 
importance 
of 
engagement in this area.
“If you care about an 
issue, become engaged,” 
Dingell said. “Advocate, 
put the face on it, on 
the issues and … as we 
go into this year, we 
need 
to 
tell 
people 
about the importance of 
Medicaid and have people 
understand … it’s a child, 
it’s a senior that has 
nobody to care for them.”
LSA freshman Timothy 
Marvin, 
who 
attended 
the event, thought the 
conversation 
on 
the 
social media divide was 
especially 
pertinent 
to 
today’s 
political 
environment.
“I liked the kind of 
tangent we had about 
social media and more 
broadly 
the 
public 
discourse 
and 
where 
that’s at in the United 
States 
today,” 
Marvin 
said. “I think that’s like a 
real problem. Policy starts 
with how people talk, and 
the way people talk isn’t 
very collaborative right 
now. And you notice we’re 
very divided, so we don’t 
really get anything done.”

ROUNDTABLE

Some 
proactively 
called 
for public apologies from 
members of City Council and 
Mayor Christopher Taylor, 
asking about how damages 
could be repaid.
Attendees 
had 
many 
questions 
about 
the 
investigation into Cox by a 
private law firm and who 
would receive their report. 
Jackson 
also 
commented 
on the lack of a Human 
Resources 
Director, 
who 
would normally be involved 
in the process. Commission 
members pointed out there is 
little precedent and they are 
not entirely sure what will 
happen. 
The 
discussion 
quickly 
moved to City Administrator 
Howard 
Lazarus, 
who 
City 
Council 
voted 
to 
remove 
Tuesday 
night. 
Councilmembers Jane Lumm, 
I-Ward 2, and Jack Eaton, 
D-Ward 4, sponsored the 
resolution to separate with 
Lazarus, which includes a 
severance of one year’s salary, 
amounting to $223,600, and 
an additional $1,000. Lumm 
is part of the ICPOC and 
Eaton was present for the 
majority of the meeting. 
After the announcement 
about the resolution to remove 
Lazarus, many community 
members 
grew 
frustrated 
and began shouting at Lumm. 

She explained his possible 
removal was unrelated to the 
situation with Cox. 
“The separation agreement 
is not in the least related,” 
Lumm said. “The timing, 
of 
course, 
is 
furious, 
but 
coincidental. 
Your 
assumption 
the 
two 
are 
related 
is 
understandable, 
but they are not related. 
This 
was 
discussed 
with 
Lazarus in various settings, 
well in advance of our email 
(announcing it).”
Many 
commission 
members 
and 
attendees 
expressed anger with the city 
government at all levels and 
especially with City Council. 
They said Cox’s placement 
on leave was a demonstration 
of the inefficacy of Ann 
Arbor’s government and the 
community’s 
underlying 
racial tensions. 
Jackson 
commented 
on 
how the situation reflects on 
Ann Arbor, regardless of the 
final outcome for Cox and 
Howard Lazarus. 
“I have no knowledge of 
what 
happened; 
I 
don’t,” 
Jackson said. “But what I do 
know is that it is not a good 
look for the city of Ann Arbor. 
It doesn’t speak well for us; 
it doesn’t speak well for the 
process.” 
Councilmember 
Eaton 
spoke to the commission, 
explaining the City Council 
has no information about 
Cox. He also said he thinks 
the public should be given 
more 
information 
and 
that 
City 
Council 
would 

investigate how the current 
situation evolved. Eaton said 
City Council did not know of 
any issues with Cox and that, 
if he is reinstated, they will 
look into repairing the harm 
that was done. 
After Lumm and Eaton 
left for the City Council 
meeting, 
the 
commission 
and 
community 
members 
expressed 
their 
gratitude 
for 
the 
opportunity 
to 
have ICPOC meet and hear 
community input. 
Ann Arbor resident Lori 
Saginaw, 
who 
has 
been 
involved in previous police 
reform efforts in the city, 
spoke about the importance 
of 
the 
community 
being 
involved in ICPOC meetings 
and how activism can affect 
the city government. 
“I cannot tell you how 
grateful I am that all of you 
are doing what you are doing,” 
Saginaw said. “There were so 
many times I was the only 
person sitting here during 
these meetings, in contrast, 
to tonight when you can 
know this community cares 
and wants to be a part of this 
work. So, talk about activism, 
here it is. We are going to 
continue to talk (about these 
issues).”
The meeting ended with 
calls 
for 
transparency 
regarding 
both 
Cox 
and 
Lazarus, as well as demands 
for the release of data about 
policing in Ann Arbor.

edu.

The panel, moderated by LSA 
freshman Hannah Kim, consisted of 
Palmer; Urban Planning Professor 
Lesli Hoey; Jennifer Petoskey, city 
of Ann Arbor solid waste outreach 
and compliance specialist; and LSA 
sophomore Chase Dautrich.
Palmer shared the procedures 
campus chefs practice to reduce 
waste and recycle dining leftovers. In 
addition to training kitchen staff, he 
emphasized the importance of cross-
utilization of ingredients in reducing 
waste in menus. 
“Food waste is at the forefront of 
all chefs’ minds,” Palmer said. “For 
chefs, it’s about training, really … It’s 
always an ongoing process.” 
To inform attendees on procedures 
taken on a university-wide scale, 
Hoey 
shared 
her 
experience 
co-leading the Internal Analysis Food 
Team on the President’s Commission 
on Carbon Neutrality. According to 
Hoey, the team’s mission is to broadly 
analyze anything related to food on 
the University of Michigan’s three 
campuses. In an effort to reduce 
carbon emissions, Hoey said the 
team 
suggests 
waste-preventing 
procedures before food is prepared 
and suggests protocol to follow after 

waste has been produced. 
“A major part of what we are 
going to suggest is some systems 
that better keep track of what we’re 
actually wasting still — even despite 
certain initiatives — and also try to 
understand what the impact is once 
you do implement more initiatives,” 
Hoey said. 
Hoey said the team is facing a 
lack of data concerning food waste 
and composting on the campuses. 
Hoey said her team struggles 
with a fragmented system of food 
production, consisting of units such 
as athletics, medicine, dining and 
autonomous consumption in schools. 
Hoey noted about 40 percent 
of food waste occurs at the retail 
and customer levels. She said this 
means changes on the individual 
level will make the largest impact on 
greenhouse gas emissions.
As someone who has always had 
a problem with throwing food away, 
Hoey said that she will even eat off 
others’ plates when feasible to prevent 
leftovers from being discarded. 
Adding to personal examples, Palmer 
shared that if he cannot find a way to 
utilize food scraps, he will feed them 
to his chickens at home. 
“It is something we constantly talk 
about,” Palmer said. “It is extremely 
important that we use our foods to 
the fullest.”
According to Prenevost, one of the 

steps in reducing waste at the event 
was using an RSVP list to estimate 
how much food would be needed. 
Prenevost said she believes this can 
help prevent excessive leftovers at 
campus events. 
LSA junior Anastasia Bergeron 
said she signed up to expand what 
she has learned through Net Impact, 
a student organization collaborating 
with businesses for environmental 
and social impact. 
“Food 
waste 
is 
really 
an 
interesting topic that I just never 
heard about before,” Bergeron said. 
“I was interested in learning more 
… I always knew it was good for the 
environment, but I never really knew 
scientifically why it’s so much better 
to compost.”
Dautrich 
discussed 
his 
involvement with the Food Recovery 
Network. The organization will host 
a regional summit on campus on April 
4. Dautrich shared that his main goal 
in reducing waste was increasing 
conversation among students. 
“One big way that people can 
promote sustainable food systems is 
just talking about it,” Dautrich said. “I 
feel like communication is one of the 
biggest challenges for this generation. 
There are a lot of problems, but there’s 
also a lot of solutions. Maybe they just 
haven’t been able to spread yet.”

“City staff are making political 
decisions,” 
Michniewicz 
said. 
“I don’t think this most recent 
iteration of what is a political tiff 
between two factions is going 
to get our community anywhere 
closer to addressing the climate 
crisis or housing crisis at the scale 
necessary.”
When presenting the resolution 
to 
fire 
Lazarus, 
Eaton 
said 
the decision came from a long 
discussion 
that 
began 
when 
Lazarus applied for a job as a city 
manager in Gainesville, Florida. 
His application referenced conflict 
with councilmembers, offending 
some of his colleagues. Eaton 
offered no further explanation 
for the reason of the proposed 
termination.
“While 
the 
council 
is 
concluding 
his 
employment 
without cause under the contract, 
it’s mostly because we don’t wish 
to state those causes, and we don’t 
wish to engage in litigation over 
whether or not the cause existed,” 
Eaton said. “It’s really of mutual 
benefit to the city administrator 
and the city to conclude this 
through negotiation rather than 
acrimony.”
Lumm said the decision came 
from a need for a more positive 
and 
productive 
relationship 
between councilmembers and the 
city administrator. 
“I don’t believe it’s appropriate 
to go into specific details about 
our city administrator or his 
performance,” Lumm said. “I 
know it is fair for anyone to 
ask why I would vote for this 
… I’ve served on council a long 
time and with quite a few city 
administrators, and I’ve seen 
the 
evidence 
that 
council-
administrator 
relationships 
are important to the effective 
functioning of city government 
both internally and externally … 
I want to support and promote 
relationships that are healthy and 
what you would expect to see on a 
high performing team.”
During the comments in support 
of the resolution, some residents in 
attendance interrupted with yells 

of disapproval and accusations 
of corruption. One held up a sign 
that read, “Good luck with a 
replacement!”
Councilmember Jeff Hayner, 
D-Ward 1, who voted in favor 
of 
firing 
Lazarus, 
addressed 
the 
crowd’s 
concerns 
about 
transparency.
“There’s personnel matters that 
don’t allow us to speak to some 
certain issues publicly,” Hayner 
said. “I certainly am sympathetic 
with the public who feel perhaps 
cheated of their opportunity to 
opine on this matter … there’s 
not much I can do to increase 
transparency around this matter 
and for that I apologize.”
Mayor 
Christopher 
Taylor 
voted against the resolution and 
expressed his disapproval of the 
council’s decision in a statement 
to The Daily.
“This action will waste more 
than $275,000 of taxpayer money 
and, as the Council majority 
admits, is entirely without cause,” 
Taylor’s statement reads. “Mr. 
Lazarus has done nothing wrong. 
This is a political termination that 
is bad for Ann Arbor.”
Taylor wrote that Lazarus is 
well qualified for his position and 
more needed than ever as the city 
faces critical stages of developing a 
$400 million budget, negotiations 
regarding 
the 
Gelman 
plume 
and the administrative leave of 
the police chief, among other 
challenges. 
He 
accused 
the 
council of punishing Lazarus 
for his resistance to “backroom” 
demands.
“Mr. Lazarus worked every day 
for Ann Arbor with intelligence, 
grace, and honor, to provide basic 
services and deliver real and 
meaningful change in pedestrian 
safety, affordable housing, and 
climate action,” Taylor’s statement 
continues. “The Council majority’s 
campaign of backroom pressure 
has culminated tonight in a 
grave public error. Ann Arbor, its 
residents and its reputation, will 
suffer from this deeply unwise 
decision for years to come.”
Councilmembers 
Zachary 
Ackerman, 
D-Ward 
3, 
Julie 
Grand, D-Ward 3, and Chip Smith, 
D-Ward 5, all of whom voted 
against the resolution, released 

an open letter addressing the 
decision. Their letter states that 
the majority made their decision 
out of dislike for Lazarus.
“Put simply, the City Council 
majority didn’t like Mr. Lazarus,” 
the letter reads. “They didn’t like 
that he pushed back when they 
pressured him to ignore city policy 
established through legislation 
passed in years prior. They didn’t 
like that he reminded them that 
their role is to set policy, not to 
micromanage and publicly berate 
public servants.”
Ackerman, 
Grand 
and 
Smith assert that the decision 
is 
unprofessional 
and 
fiscally 
irresponsible.
“Removing 
the 
City 
Administrator 
without 
cause, 
throwing away his skills when 
they are needed most, and using 
your money to pay him to leave is 
offensive to our most fundamental 
values,” the letter continues. “The 
Ann Arbor we represent believes 
in and expects transparency.”
During general public comment, 
a number of attendees expressed 
outrage at the council’s decision. 
Speakers were critical of the lack 
of cause for terminating Lazarus.
Sally Hart Peterson, executive 
policy 
adviser 
for 
economic 
development at the Office of the 
City Administrator and former 
City Councilmember representing 
Ward 2, urged the councilmembers 
to rethink their vote, calling 
their decision detrimental to the 
interests of the community.
“The decision to terminate 
our city administrator without 
cause undermines the long-term 
integrity and stability of the 
administrative role of the city,” 
Peterson said. “It undermines 
the morale of our city employees, 
it is fiscally irresponsible and 
it is an insult to all who rely on 
our administrator’s leadership, 
authority 
and 
keen 
decision-
making to keep the city running 
on a day-to-day basis … (Lazarus) 
has a clear sense of right and 
wrong, a respect for authority, 
and understands the clear line and 
division between city council and 
city administrator.”

 The Center for Responsive 
Politics 
reported 
the 
NRA 
spent more than $3 million on 
lobbying expenditures in 2019. 
Anglewicz 
mentioned 
the 
NRA’s 
extensive 
efforts 
to 
ensure gun safety and its 
dedication to education. 
“Even 
if 
we 
can’t 
find 
common ground on policies, 
we can always find common 
ground on how we can be 
safe 
and 
responsible 
gun 
owners,” Anglewicz said. “So, 
a lot of what we do is really, the 
majority, about safety education 
and training.” 
LSA 
senior 
Taylor 
King, 
co-founder of Students Demand 
Action, 
an 
activist 
group 
dedicated to combating gun 

violence, said gun safety must 
be a priority in a conversation of 
gun control. King said she has 
done gun violence prevention 
work for 11 years, is a survivor 
of gun violence and previously 
worked with Moms Demand 
Action 
before 
launching 
Students Demand Action on 
Michigan’s campus. 
“I and Students Demand 
Action as a whole really have no 
problem with members of the 
NRA,” King said. “We promote 
gun safety. We think gun 
ownership, it is a constitutional 
right, but we think there are 
some people who are a threat 
to themselves and others who 
probably should not have guns, 
and that people that do have 
guns should be using them 
safely and responsibly … If (the 
NRA U event’s) focus is on gun 
safety and gun education, more 
power to them.”

Anglewicz 
discussed 
the 
debate surrounding universal 
background checks. She said 
the term Universal Background 
Checks is “dangerous” because 
it gives the impression there are 
no background checks in place. 
She noted the NRA has been in 
support of the National Instant 
Criminal Background System, 
also known as NICS, since it was 
introduced in 1998; however, 
the NRA does not support H.R. 
8, which requires background 
checks between private parties. 
The NRA argues this is a 
private transaction and opposes 
legislation that would enforce 
a universal background check 
requirement for gun transfers 
between 
unlicensed 
sellers, 
such 
as 
transfers 
between 
family members.
“You want to know what 
‘universal’ is?” Anglewicz said. 
“It’s ‘I want to transfer a pistol 

to my father, I have to go get 
paperwork, run a background 
check on him, do all of our 
fingerprinting, then sell him 
the firearm and re-register it’ 
and that sort of thing. That’s 
what they’re calling ‘universal.’ 
We already have background 
checks.”
Anglewicz admitted current 
background 
checks 
fail 
to 
prevent threatening individuals 
from obtaining firearms, but 
gun reform should not come 
from bans on types of assault 
weapons. 
“We 
already 
have 
background checks,” Anglewicz 
said. “They are failing. It’s a 
terrible system and it needs 
help. People who are convicted 
felons, adjudicated mentally ill 
and a danger to themselves and 
others, should not have access 
to firearms. So, this system is 
broken. So, instead of focusing 

on the system, people are 
talking about assault weapon 
bans. Congress is wasting our 
time with these silly things that 
are going to keep nobody safe.”
Anglewicz 
discussed 
the 
term “assault weapons” and 
said the term did not exist prior 
to 1989, calling it a “made-up 
political term.”
In a 2018 article, CNBC 
reported 
that 
the 
firearm 
industry often refers to “assault 
rifle” as a military weapon 
with “select fire capabilities,” 
or the capability to switch 
between 
semi-automatic 
or 
a fully automatic mode. The 
AR-15 only has semi-automatic 
settings and is therefore not an 
assault rifle by this definition. 
Anglewicz 
referenced 
rifles 
more powerful than the AR-15, 
and said despite AR-15 high 
profile media presence, assault 
weapon bans are not the most 

effective approaches to reform. 
“Any gun can be deadly,” 
Anglewicz 
said. 
“But 
to 
demonize one particular rifle in 
the effort to ban it so they can 
create a slippery slope, you have 
to see through that. It’s very 
dangerous rhetoric.”
LSA freshman Nick Schuler, 
College Republicans freshman 
chairman, said he hoped the 
event fostered an educational 
dialogue 
about 
the 
Second 
Amendment and gun control 
debate. 
“Our goal is not to convert 
everyone into a gun lover, but 
just to have more understanding 
on campus,” Schuler said. “We 
think it’s very important to 
understand both sides of the 
political spectrum no matter 
where you lie, and to create 
more of a culture and foster a 
good campus that has diversity 
of thought.”


A 

common sentiment shared 
by people of color is that it’s 
exhausting to constantly 
have to explain your identities, 
your culture and whether or 
not a particular comment is 
appropriate to say when a simple 
Google search likely would have 
provided the inquirer with the 
answer to the question. What 
is often even more frustrating 
is that it is obvious when you’re 
not actively trying to diversify 
what you know about social 
identities or you’re not seeking 
out the opportunity to learn more 
about backgrounds and cultures 
different from your own. While 
asking genuine questions isn’t to 
be discouraged, be aware of your 
intention. If you’re coming off as 
close-minded, then it is in itself a 
form of ignorance. Diversity is a 
complex concept and mandates 
effort and attention. So, making 
inappropriate 
comments, 
asking offensive questions or 
repeatedly committing the same 
microaggressions 
sends 
the 
message that the asker is choosing 
to be ignorant. 
That said, if you’re curious 
about the food a peer is eating 
or a cultural event a friend is 
celebrating, be conscious of your 
word choice and ask questions 
respectfully. The general rule of 
thumb: Exhibiting a willingness 
to learn will always be celebrated. 
However, people of color often feel 
as though they’re burdened with 
the responsibility of educating 
their peers. This creates a campus 
climate that is uncomfortable for 
students and faculty of color. 
It is known that people of color 
experience 
college 
differently 
than white people. It’s difficult 
to 
navigate 
predominantly 
white spaces while enduring 
microaggressions 
along 
the 
way. 
Back 
in 
2017, 
Marist 
College 
conducted 
a 
survey 
investigating “Racism in the 
United States: Who’s Responsible 
for Fixing the Problem.” The 

results of the survey showed the 
majority of Americans place the 
responsibility of tackling racism 
head-on upon everyone, not just 
one specific race. Additionally, 
most Americans did not agree 
that the burden of ending racism 
should fall upon people of color. 
Similar to the findings of this poll, 
it’s important to not only address 
issues related to social identities 
like race and ethnicity as they 
happen on campus, but also take 
initiative to educate ourselves on 
the diversity of social identities on 
campus before an issue arises.
As students at the University 
of Michigan, we are privileged 
to have access to a plethora of 
resources: 
books, 
computers, 
courses, 
professors 
and 
educational 
events. 
Therefore, 
it is the general expectation we 
recognize that privilege and use 
it to better our knowledge. This 
means finding space on your 
Google Calendar to attend Martin 
Luther King Jr. symposiums, 
events, talks and dialogues. This 
means attending conferences and 
dialogue-based events on topics 
like racism on college campuses 
not because it’s an extra credit 
assignment, but because you’re 
trying to learn more.
I’ve also spoken with students 
who are not from marginalized 
communities or do not identify 
with minority groups who feel 
like they’re walking on eggshells 
around classmates of identities 
different 
from 
theirs. 
Even 
more so in courses that discuss 
multicultural content and topics 
related to race and ethnicity. 
Rather than avoid participating 
to prevent accidentally offending 
your 
classmate 
or 
to 
risk 
appearing 
not 
“woke,” 
take 
actionable steps to improve your 
knowledge on diversity, equity 
and 
inclusion 
activities 
and 
initiatives on campus as well as 
to further your communication 
skills, as you’ll likely be a part of 
diverse work environments in the 

near future. For example, take 
an introductory level women’s 
studies class like Women’s Studies 
220. Take it because you’re 
likely to engage in relationships 
or conversations with women, 
whether in professional contact, 
friendships, romantic relations, 
etc. 
Diversity, equity and inclusion 
events, programs and policies 
are, 
of 
course, 
important 
for 
undergraduate 
students’ 
professional 
and 
personal 
development. We all know that. 
Nowadays, the terms “diversity,” 
“accessibility” and “inclusivity” 
are found in every Fortune 500 
company’s mission statement or 
campus initiative. This is great in 
theory, but it’s no longer sufficient 
to simply exercise awareness of 
what those terms mean. Instead, 
consider viewing these words 
through the lens of your peers 
and 
their 
lived 
experiences. 
Showing support and acting as an 
ally involves educating yourself, 
showing up and engaging with 
other students of diverse identities 
during 
dialogues 
covering 
controversial topics. 
As University students, it’s 
important to support one another 
on our way to becoming well-
rounded professionals and part 
of the workforce. For students of 
color, this means inviting your 
friends of all identities and cultural 
backgrounds to the cultural events 
for the organizations in which 
you’re 
involved. 
Don’t 
solely 
market these events to those who 
are already immersing themselves 
in DEI endeavors. It is equally 
important to engage in DEI-
related discussions with people 
of diverse thoughts, experiences 
and ideas as well. If we all take it 
upon ourselves to share our lived 
experiences with one another, 
we will all benefit together as a 
community.

the 
House 
Judiciary Committee 
approved articles of 
impeachment against President 
Donald Trump in December, 
Chairman 
and 
Rep. 
Jerrold 
Nadler, D-N.Y., declared that it 
was “a solemn and sad day.”
In retrospect, Nadler could 
not have been more right — 
just for all the wrong reasons. 
The impeachment trial against 
President Trump was a deeply 
unsettling spectacle that targeted 
far 
more 
than 
the 
current 
occupant of the White House. It 
ripped at the very fabric of our 
country. 
The 
impeachment 
against 
Trump was solemn and sad not 
because our president was being 
charged with high crimes and 
misdemeanors, but because one of 
America’s major political parties 
had unashamedly stooped to such 
a low level. The trial was a clear 
slap in the face for so many in this 
country.
As many of us know, the 
impeachment effort fortunately 
came to a quick end a couple 
of weeks ago in the president’s 
favor. But what has not come to 
an end is the dangerous political 
pattern this trial is a part of. The 
impeachment was the last straw 
for many in this nation, and 
Americans have had enough of 
it. There’s simply no excuse for 
the Democratic Party’s relentless 
attacks on our president. 
Since 
our 
president 
first 
announced 
his 
candidacy 
nearly five years ago, Democrats 
have unceasingly picked apart 
everything 
about 
Trump, 
investigating 
and 
scrutinizing 
his every move. They have 
thrown bombshells into the Oval 
Office, one after another. They 
have put his business affairs 
under a microscope. And, most 
recently, they have impeached our 
president and put him on trial for 
weeks in front of the American 
people.
Trump isn’t perfect. He’s made 
some questionable choices that 
fall outside the boundaries of 
historical presidential behavior. 
But 
an 
occasional 
mistake 
shouldn’t subject the president to 
a process that has only occurred 
three other times in U.S. history.
Democrats have truly done 
everything imaginable to damage 
our president and bring him down 
once and for all. They have tried 
to rip this country apart, literally. 
(I am referring to Speaker of the 
House Nancy Pelosi’s stunning 
move at the end of Trump’s State 
of the Union speech).
While the impeachment trial 
only ended recently, Democrats 
began plotting the end of Trump’s 
political career before it had 
begun. It all began in 2011, when 
Fusion GPS was founded in 
Washington, D.C., by a group of 
veteran journalists. 
While 
Fusion 
did 
some 
investigation in the past, it rose to 

prominence after it was hired to 
investigate the 2016 presidential 
candidates, 
which 
included 
Trump. By the time Trump won 
the election in November of that 
year, Fusion had hired intelligence 
expert Christopher Steele to help 
investigate Trump’s ties to the 
Russian 
government. 
Steele’s 
research and the firm’s efforts 
ultimately produced a plethora 
of alarming allegations against 
the president, among them that 
Trump had an extensive record of 
collusion with Moscow. Once all of 
these unverified charges against 
Trump 
surfaced, 
Democrats 
quickly worked to implicate the 
president by constantly talking 
about “Trump-Russia collusion,” 
even though the origins of the 
allegations and the dossier as a 
whole are questionable.

As the Trump administration 
continued 
to 
come 
under 
unrelenting 
scrutiny, 
Special 
Counsel for the United States 
Department of Justice Robert 
Mueller came into the picture, 
assuming 
command 
of 
the 
investigation 
once 
he 
was 
appointed in May 2017. After 
working for about two years, 
Mueller’s anticlimactic findings 
were released in a final report 
that was clearly disappointing for 
Democrats. The underwhelming 
ruling didn’t charge Trump with 
any crime at all and found the 
president didn’t engage in any 
conspiracy 
with 
the 
Russian 
government.
But the Democratic Party didn’t 
stop here. Still determined to take 
the Trump presidency down, 
they began to explore other ways 
that they could somehow end this 
resilient 
administration. 
Soon 
after the conclusion of the Mueller 
investigation, 
the 
Democrats 
used their broad control over 
the investigative powers of the 
House of Representatives to begin 
an impeachment inquiry into a 
July 2019 phone call between 
Trump and Ukranian President 
Volodymyr Zelensky.
This 
impeachment 
inquiry 
quickly spiraled out of control, 
collapsing 
almost 
immediately. 
From the start, it was obvious it 
was a highly partisan effort, with 
every Republican voting against 
both articles of impeachment in 
the House.
Even though the Constitution 
plainly requires the House to 
forward the articles to the Senate, 
Pelosi and Democratic leadership 

initially resisted because they 
knew Trump would never be 
convicted in the Republican-
majority Senate. But still, they 
were eventually passed on and 
— after weeks of monotonous 
trial proceedings with few new 
revelations — Trump was swiftly 
acquitted with only one Republican 
siding with Democrats, receiving 
the vindication he deserved.
That brings us to today. After 
years 
of 
systematic 
attempts 
at 
destroying 
this 
legitimate 
administration, Trump is still the 
president. And he’s doing better 
than ever before. Meanwhile, 
Democrats have been forced to 
return to the drawing board, and 
it’s not hard to wonder what they’ll 
try next. 
But I sincerely hope that before 
the next allegations surface — 
before they engineer the next 
bombshell and before they find 
another “impeachable” offense 
— Democrats take a moment 
and return to reality. While they 
have been trying to demolish, 
Trump has worked to reconstruct. 
Trump may be controversial, but 
Americans have unequivocally 
expressed their support for his 
innovative policies.
A recent Gallup poll released 
in the midst of the polarizing 
impeachment trial found that 49 
percent of Americans approve of 
the president’s job in office, an 
all-time high from this pollster. 
This may not be a majority of the 
nation, but according to the same 
poll, only 46 percent of Americans 
approved of President Obama’s 
job at the same point in his first 
term. Moreover, Gallup added in 
another poll that over 60 percent 
of Americans feel they’re better 
off than they were three years 
ago, while only 45 percent said 
the same at the same point in the 
Obama presidency.
In the end, whether Democrats 
like it or not, Trump has done a 
lot of good for millions of people 
across the country. These numbers 
don’t signal us that we have a rogue 
president who is blatantly violating 
American law, as Democrats tell 
us, but a respected leader who is 
doing great things. 
More than ever before, it’s 
time to give our president the 
respect he deserves and actually 
let him govern as the leader of 
the U.S. I’m not asking Trump’s 
political opponents and haters to 
vote for him in November. Every 
American has a right to go to the 
polls at the end of this year and 
vote for whichever candidate 
they believe can best lead our 
country forward.
But until then, it’s time to 
part ways with this immature 
behavior. We may not all support 
Trump, but we all have a critical 
duty to be fair to our president 
and support him in his ultimate 
mission to uplift all Americans.

W

hat 
is 
in 
Georgia 
besides the Coca-Cola 
headquarters, peaches 
and the state opossum, Pogo? Well, 
both the soul of the Republican Party 
and its greatest danger — former 
Democratic Rep. Stacey Abrams — 
reside in the state. While I would 
love to write about the massive threat 
that Abrams poses to Republicans, 
there’s frankly not enough space in 
this article to accurately portray her 
brilliance, so let’s take a look at the 
soul of the Republican Party — and 
by that, I do not mean the former 
steak salesman in the White House. 
In fact, I do not believe that the soul 
of the party lies with any one person 
right now, but I believe that two 
Republican Senate candidates — Sen. 
Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., and United 
States Rep. Doug Collins — are vying 
to be its figurehead.
This 
old-fashioned 
far-right 
versus center-right battle began 
Aug. 28, 2019, when Georgia’s senior 
senator, Johnny Isakson, announced 
that midway through his third 
term he would retire due to health 
concerns. Immediately, all eyes 
went to Atlanta where Gov. Brian 
Kemp was given a gift and a curse: 
Appointing Isakson’s replacement. 
Kemp, ever the strategist, held an 
open application process where 
any Georgia citizen could submit 
a resume and cover letter. Though 
this publicity stunt bought Kemp 
some time, the political universe 
quickly narrowed the selection 
pool to Collins, Loeffler and former 
Secretary of Health and Human 
Services Tom Price. However, with 
Price’s public resignation putting him 
in a precarious legal position, Kemp’s 
table was set.
If former President George W. 
Bush and Sen. Mitch McConnell, 
R-Ky., could breed a senator in a lab, 
Kelly Loeffler would be the product. 
Born to soybean farmers in rural 
Illinois, Loeffler worked her way up 
the corporate ladder of a commodities 
trader, Intercontinental Exchange, 
and eventually became the CEO 
of Bakkt, an IE subsidiary, in 2018. 
Throughout her business career, 
Loeffler was an avid Republican 
donor and activist, having donated 
more than $3.2 million with her 
husband. The power couple’s pet 
causes included former presidential 
candidate Mitt Romney’s campaign, 
the National Republican Senatorial 
Committee and former Speaker of the 
House Paul Ryan. While her money 
brought her into the party’s upper 
echelons, she has always wanted to 

hold elected office. And after seeing 
David Perdue win an open Senate seat 
in 2014 that she passed up, Loeffler 
did not want to miss her chance to 
become a part of Congress’s clubby 
upper chamber in 2020. 
While Loeffler seems born for 
this job, Collins couldn’t be less 
poised to work with McConnell. 
From humble beginnings in rural 
Georgia, Collins earned a bachelor’s 
degree from the University of North 
Georgia and a master’s in divinity 
from the New Orleans Baptist 
Theological Seminary. Following 
his education, he was the pastor 
at Chicopee Baptist Church for 11 
years. Capitalizing on his church’s 
success, Collins entered the political 
sphere through the Georgia House of 
Representatives, ultimately moving 
to the U.S. House where he currently 
serves as the Ranking Member of 
the House Judiciary Committee. 
From this perch, the Congressman 
has spent the last two years making 
his southern drawl and fast-talking 
a staple on cable news by arguing 
with Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. 
and making “irregardless” trend on 
Twitter.
For Kemp, this decision was 
obvious: Loeffler. The former Bakkt 
CEO and co-owner of Atlanta’s 
WNBA team had plenty of financial 
backing for her 2020 run, and, more 
importantly, she shared Kemp’s 
traditional Chamber of Commerce 
republicanism. 
Conversely, 
the 
far-right Collins had no qualms 
about appearing on Fox News or 
berating former Special Counsel 
for the U.S. Department of Justice 
Robert 
Mueller, 
which 
earned 
Collins a strong ally: the President. 
Collins’s position on the front lines 
of Trump’s defense put him in the 
President’s good graces. Therefore, 
Trump extensively lobbied Kemp 
behind the scenes for Collins. Kemp’s 
tiebreaker was McConnell, who gave 
him a gut check and reminded Kemp 
that Republicans could still win the 
Senate in 2020 even if Trump lost. 
Therefore, Loeffler needed to be 
appointed. And on Dec. 4, she was.
When she got into office, Loeffler 
had 
one 
priority: 
get 
Trump’s 
endorsement. From allying with 
Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, during the 
impeachment 
saga 
to 
baselessly 
attacking Romney, she has proven she 
will go to great lengths to receive it. 
She was on track to receive this golden 
ticket to victory, but on Jan. 29, her 
life got significantly harder as Collins 
announced that he would challenge 
her in the special election for Isakson’s 

old seat. This decision was met with 
a swift rebuke from the chairman of 
the NRSC Kevin McLaughlin, who 
said “All (Collins) has done is put two 
Senate seats, multiple House seats, and 
Georgia’s 16 electoral votes in play.”
Additional groups like the Senate 
Leadership Fund and several sitting 
Republican senators have issued 
similar warnings, but, importantly, 
there is one person who has been 
conspicuously quiet on the issue: 
President Donald Trump. With great 
power traditionally comes great 
responsibility, but the former reality 
TV star has been like a bull in a china 
shop — or horse in a hospital — over 
the last three years. Thus, Trump is 
the wild card in this primary who 
could drastically swing the race one 
way or the other. However, learning 
from his 2017 primary endorsement 
of Luther Strange over the ultimate 
victor Roy Moore in Alabama, 
Trump has typically refrained from 
supporting candidates in competitive 
primaries. Therefore, Loeffler and 
Collins will likely have to slug it out 
until Nov. 3.
While the winner of the special 
election remains unknown, the 
winner of the Republican infighting 
is 
one 
person: 
Rev. 
Raphael 
Warnock. Warnock is a Baptist 
preacher from Atlanta who has 
been sharply critical of Trump 
and announced his candidacy for 
the 2020 special election amid a 
flurry of prominent Democratic 
endorsements, including Abrams 
and Democratic Rep. John Lewis. 
Warnock’s deep ties with Black 
voters will energize this key voting 
bloc in 2020, which poses a greater 
threat to the Republicans than either 
Collins or Loeffler; and, because of 
Georgia’s Jungle Primary election 
rules, these three will share a ballot 
in November. If none of them reach 
50 percent, then there will be a 
runoff between the top two, but the 
two Republicans are in a precarious 
position because they must fight on 
multiple fronts while Warnock can 
address them as a unit and possibly 
squeeze out 50 percent.
The bottom line is if Republicans 
want to keep this key seat from 
Warnock and the Democrats, they 
have to convince Trump to endorse 
someone. If he doesn’t, we will see a 
fight for the soul of the Republican 
Party play out, and we might see the 
end of the party’s 15-year Georgia 
dynasty.

Battle for the soul of the Republican party

“Music Talks” is a series where 
Daily Music Writers give their takes 
on the biggest releases in new music. 
From picking best and worst tracks 
to asking what makes a record tick, 
the Music beat is here to give praise 
and give shit to music worth talking 
about.
For better or for worse, Kevin 
Parker (the tie-dyed mastermind 
behind Tame Impala) is back. 
After a relatively quiet 2018 spent 
collaborating with the likes of SZA, 
Theophilus London and ZHU, 
Parker finally announced a new 
album in early 2019, The Slow Rush, 
and dropped a new track called 
“Patience” in mid-March. For some, 
it was like the homecoming of a 
friend who had spent over twelve 
months in Big Sur, dropping a 
whole lot of acid as a vehicle to find 
themself. That is, he is now back 
and better than ever. For others, it 
was like the return of a yacht rock 
nuisance cosplaying as a psych-
pop-rock poseur. (For better or for 
worse, remember?) Since the release 
of “Patience,” Parker has been in 
full-on album-release-mode, slowly 
trickling out singles (as the album’s 
title implies). Now, he’s wrapping 
up several months of a press tour 
that has included a much-lauded 
performance on Saturday Night 
Live and an interview with Beats 1’s 
Zane Lowe, in which he boasted that 
while creating the album, he was 
inspired by Travis Scott (the two 
are mutual fans and collaborators) 
and shopping while stoned (a rather 
pedestrian activity these days). 

The Slow Rush is the first massive 
release of 2020. Will it remain 
that way, or will it wash away the 
current of Parker’s past releases (get 
it?)? Find out below.
Jim Wilson, Daily Arts Writer: 
First and foremost, which camp 
do you ascribe to: Tame Impala is 
the force that will bring modern 
psychedelia to the mainstream, 
or Tame Impala is the force that 
will reduce modern psychedelia 
to nothing more than marijuana-
tinged yacht rock?
(all laughing)
Clara Scott, Daily Arts Writer: 
Well, uh, I’m a fan of Tame Impala, 
but I don’t think that they’re 
bringing psychedelia back to its 
former glory. However, I think 
that they’re doing something really 
interesting on this album where 
they’re merging psychedelia with 
house in a weird way. I would say 
I’m a fan, but I wouldn’t say that I 
ascribe to either camp.
Sam Cantie, Music Beat Editor: 
What do you mean by merging with 
house, may I ask?
Scott: I think a couple of tracks 
on this album that are more 
house and techno inspired than 
the rock foundation that a lot of 
Tame Impala’s previous music 
was influenced by, especially with 
the use of synthesizers and digital 
production.
Cantie: I can’t firmly say that I’m 
in either camp. Like, I’m somewhere 
in between because well ... let me 
think of a reason for that ... I just feel 
like a lot of people listen to Tame 
Impala without any notion of genre 
or what that means for the music 
industry as a whole. It’s more that 
the entity of Tame Impala is a cool 
thing to say you listen to at parties, 

or like a good conversation sparker.
Diana 
Yassin, 
Daily 
Arts 
Writer: I would say I’m a very 
casual fan, and I don’t think I’ve 
ever been very pumped about 
stuff that Tame Impala puts out, 
but whenever I see Tame Impala, 
I think, “hey, that’s great!’ I think 
they bring back psychedelia in some 
ways, like what Sam said, there’s a 
new sense of meshing new genres, 
like what you see rap artists doing 
these days. I don’t think there’s 
anything pure psychedelic, though.
Drew Gadbois, Daily Arts 
Writer: If you asked me, like, 
eight years ago, around Lonerism, 
probably would have been way 
more on the side of “they’re doing 
something really different … ”
Cantie: Wouldn’t you have been 
like 12?
(all laughing)
Scott: I was the same way!
Gadbois: I think now, and it’s 
interesting that Clara brought up 
house, that it’s more synth-wave …
Scott: Interesting.
Gadbois: Especially this album, 
but also Currents. Like, Kevin Parker 
definitely dove deep into what he 
could do with his synthesizers. It 
kind of strayed a little too far to 
be called psychedelic in that way, 
because once you go synth-wave, 
you’re going into a completely 
different atmosphere. And, to “flex 
my genre knowledge,” I also heard 
some hypnagogic pop, which I, ya 
know, only know one band that falls 
under that genre, but ... yeah, I’m 
probably on the latter side of things 
here.
Wilson: 
That’s 
definitely 
a 
round-about way of saying it.
Anish 
Tamhaney, 
Special 
Guest and Daily Film Editor: I 

think Kevin Parker has something 
really special, and I think the 
question on the longevity of Tame 
Impala’s impact was sort of an open 
one before this album came out. But 
I think, if anything, that question 
has been answered negatively by 
this album. I think people will not 
talk about Tame Impala the same 
way they did a year ago, a couple 
years ago after this album.
Cantie: Hot takes …
Scott: Hot takes. 
Wilson: Whole lot of hot takes … 
Yeah, I’m not a fan. I think it’s a lot of 
yacht rock, and… yeah.
Scott: I think yacht rock is selling 
it short.
Gadbois: 
Yeah, 
Michael 
McDonald plaaaayed. You can’t 
compare!
Scott: Yeah, we all love Steely 
Dan in this house (at Daily Arts).
Q: What is your snap reaction 
to ‘The Slow Rush’?
Yassin: Why does every song 
sound the same?
Scott: Oh. well, I don’t think 
every song sounds the same. I 
really… aagh (drops phone) ... really 
liked the first one and “One More 
Year.”

Cantie: Mine was that all I could 
hear was Kevin Parker’s voice ... 
constantly ... over and over again ... 
you couldn’t discern anything else.
(unanimous agreement)
Tamhaney: It was a little too 
similar for my liking. A few times it 
took risks were either on the singles 
or the finale, “One More Hour,” 
which was one of the times I truly 
felt impressed. I don’t feel like that 
ending was earned by the rest of the 
album.
Scott: Yeah, the opening track 
and the ending track are the best 
ones 
that 
weren’t 
previously 
released. Anish is totally right: 
when he took the risk to break from 
his norm, those tracks were the best 
ones, but the rest was just filler.
Wilson: He definitely wanted to 
make himself the shining star. In an 
interview, he said that he was ready 
to fully embrace being a celebrity, 
and this album is the embodiment 
of that. 
Gadbois: That brings up an 
interesting point: should certain 
artists, when they’re supposed to be 
bands, be the deciding force? I don’t 
even know … calling it Tame Impala 
seems disingenuous. It should just 

be Kevin Parker.
Scott: This project, yeah. 
(murmuring, 
probably 
in 
agreement)
Gadbois: To go off of your point, 
he sings too much for his own good, 
he doesn’t let his own production 
shine when, a lot of times, it really 
should. It just seems like he’s trying 
to talk about something when he 
has nothing to talk about.
Cantie: I watched his triple j 
interview or whatever, and I got 
that vibe, one hundred percent. He 
was saying he listened to no other 
music while making this album. He 
was like, “Elevator music set me off” 
and I …
Scott: Mü-ZAK!
Cantie: Yeah, and when they 
were asking him what’s your 
infatuation with time and how this 
album plays with nostalgia and all 
that stuff, he was like, “I don’t know. 
I was kinda just thinking about it. 
Kinda what was just on the brain,” 
while I’m like, “ah I want more from 
you!” 

Music Talks: A rountable 
on Tame Impala’s latest

WIKIMEDIA COMMONS

Rob makes “Top Five” lists. 
Movies, villains, musical artists, 
heartbreaks. Rob has a Top Five 
for everything, and while looking 
straight into the camera, she’ll tell 
them all to you. “High Fidelity” has 
returned and may very well deserve 
a place on your next Top Five list. 
In a reimagination of the Nick 
Hornby novel and 2000 film of the 
same name, Hulu’s new TV series 
“High Fidelity” updates its record-
shop love story to 2020. Starring 
Zoë Kravitz (“Big Little Lies”) as 
Rob, this series rewrites its own 
story with a fresh image of living 
and dating in New York City.
Rob, in addition to making 
constant Top Five lists, owns a 
record store where she works 
with her friends Simon (David 
H. Holmes, “Mindhunter”) and 
Cherise (Da’Vine Joy Randolph, 
“Dolemite Is My Name”). After a 
particularly devastating breakup 
with number five on her “Top Five 
Heartbreaks” list, Rob decides to 
revisit her list and investigate what 
exactly has prevented her from 
finding true love. 
As Rob reluctantly reopens 
her past, ex-boyfriend No. 5 
Mac (Kingsley Ben-Adir, “Peaky 
Blinders”) returns from London 
after moving away the year before 
and brings a new fiancé back 

with him. Now confronted with a 
choice between making amends or 
wallowing in self-pity, Rob begins 
the dreaded process of “getting 
back out there” and opening herself 
back up to the world.
Unlike previous versions of Rob, 
Kravitz’s character struggles not 
only with navigating her love life, 
but also with her position as a black, 
queer, small business owner in a 

quickly gentrifying neighborhood. 
The New York of “High Fidelity” 
is the New York often ignored by 
TV — looking at you, “Sex and the 
City”and “Girls.” 
“High Fidelity” maintains an 
atmosphere that matches cynicism 
and social critique equally with 
lighthearted fun and humor. Much 
like the original novel and film, 
“High Fidelity” addresses the topics 
of unrequited love and unbridled 

music snobbery with the snark 
and occasional earnestness that 
unites millenials and Gen X. Rob, 
obsessed with music history and 
pop culture, presents a paradoxical 
image of youth that is both lost and 
found. 
Between 
long 
rants 
about 
the history of the Beatles or the 
indifference of the universe, “High 
Fidelity” captures the confusing, 
soul-sucking process of recovering 
from bad relationships and allows 
its audience to enjoy the sadness 
and absurdity that ensues in the 
process. Despite Rob’s persistent 
negativity and self-doubt, “High 
Fidelity” offers a realistic and, at 
times, heart-warming response to 
modern dating culture.
This iteration of the “High 
Fidelity” story also includes the 
most important aspect of the 
original: 
an 
absolutely 
killer 
soundtrack. Both the book and 
film relied heavily on music as 
its language for expressing Rob’s 
journey, and the Hulu show pulls 
no punches with its mix of hip hop, 
disco, punk, French pop, ‘90s R&B 
and unapologetic guilty-pleasure 
songs. 
In accordance with its source 
material, the spirit of “High 
Fidelity” is carefully preserved in 
its 2020 update. The Hulu series 
makes significant amendments to 
the original version but executes its 
vision with wit and artistic flair. In 
its first season, “High Fidelity” has 
already staked its claim for a place

TV REVIEW
TV REVIEW

“Can 
we 
be 
careful 
of 
those 
bells 
on 
the 
floor 
there?” 
shouted 
Malcolm 
Tulip, assistant professor in 
the Department of Theatre 
& Drama and director of 
“Yerma,” in the middle of 
my 
interview. 
His 
voice 
reverberated 
through 
the 
Lydia Mendelssohn Theatre, 
bouncing off the historic walls 
with intensity. A student on 
stage, unfazed, snatched up 
the golden bundle immediately 
before turning back to the 
scene. 
A 
Thursday 
night 
rehearsal of “Yerma” was in 
full swing, and gloriously so.
This coming weekend, the 
Department of Theatre and 
Drama will present “Yerma,” 
a story of a young woman 
struggling to conceive in a 
small village in rural Spain. 
“Yerma” 
was 
originally 
written by beloved Spanish 
poet and playwright Frederico 
García Lorca in 1934, two years 
before he was executed in the 
Spanish Civil War of 1936. 
This performance of “Yerma,” 
a 
heartfelt 
tragedy 
that 
questions 
womanhood, 
was 
translated by Jo Clifford, an 
openly transgender playwright 
who’s achieved acclaim in the 
London theatre scene.
“There 
will 
be 
nothing 
that’s naturalistic in the piece. 
Yet, the idea of the piece is still 
to get to something essentially 
human,” Tulip said. 
He considers “Yerma” to be 
a blend between traditional 
theatre 
and 
out-of-the-
box thinking, preferring to 
add his own unique flair to 
conventional productions.
Tulip also prefers to think 
of 
“Yerma” 
using 
Lorca’s 
description: “a tragical poem 
in six paintings.” Looking out 
at the rehearsal stage that 
Thursday night, bustling with 
a flurry of students, I began 
to see what Tulip meant. Art 
forms 
are 
interchangeable 
and fluid — who’s to say a 
poem can’t also be a play, as 

well as a painting? Paintings, 
while static, can convey facial 
expressions and gestures as 
acutely as a moving body of art 
can.
Diversity is crucial to the 
identity of “Yerma.” The cast 
is composed of 14 women 
and only three men, a rare 
scripting in classical theatre. 
Many of the cast are native 
Spanish speakers and all music 
is composed and performed by 
students. 
“It was important to have a 
different array of bodies on the 
stage that are capable and able 
to do different things,” said 
Javier Soriano, a sophomore 
Theatre Performance Acting 
major playing the shepherd 
and mailman.
Mallory Avnet, a senior in 
the BFA acting program, knew 
she wanted to play Yerma 
the moment she saw Simone 
Stone’s production broadcast 
by 
National 
Theater 
Live, 
starring Billie Piper as Yerma. 
“I remember seeing it and 
thinking, I have to. I have to do 
that,” Avnet said. “The role is 
so complex, complicated, gritty 
and 
messy. 
Unfortunately, 
there’s not a lot of roles that 
encompass that for women in 
theatre.”
“I think everyone’s perspective 
on Yerma is ever changing, but 
it’s always very judgmental,” 
Soriano said. 
The same can be said for 
women all over the world, a 
gender frequently slandered 

for being too proactive or 
assertive. Every woman can 
understand 
the 
trepidation 
with which Yerma encounters 
the world, even if Yerma as a 
character seems unhinged at 
times. 
“I resonate with her so 
strangely. 
This 
show 
has 
brought up things for me that I 
wasn’t expecting,” Avnet said.
As all good works of art are, 
“Yerma” is still relevant to 
our times even though it was 
written nearly a century ago. 
“The 
creative 
voice 
is 
critical and subversive. We’re 
in that world now. Especially 
post-impeachment,” 
Tulip 
said. 
The most recent budget 
proposal for 2021, released 
by the Trump administration 
weeks ago, proposes cutting 
the 
National 
Endowment 
for 
the 
Arts 
and 
the 
National Endowment for the 
Humanities completely.
Lorca wrote “Yerma” in 
the wake of the Spanish Civil 
War against fascism. Years 
later, we’re still struggling 
with the same balance of 
power. Liberal arts have a 
reputation 
of 
challenging 
existing, oppressive powers, 
and “Yerma” is no exception.
“Yerma” isn’t a flashy, eye-
catching play or musical. But 
often times, the best theatre 
isn’t. The cast is confident that 
“Yerma” will touch everyone in 
some way, minute or grand, when 
they leave the Mendelssohn.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Some days, you wake up feeling 
like a queen of darkness and start 
searching 
through 
your 
sock 
drawer for your chandelier earrings 
and crow companion. On these 
days, I tend to turn to the music and, 
more specifically, the music videos 
of Angel Olsen. One look at the 
cover of her new album All Mirrors 
— featuring her severe, eyeliner-
caked stare emerging from a halo of 
black fur — and you know this is not 
a woman to be trifled with.
All Mirrors emphasizes her 
eccentric style like never before — it 
uses sweeping string arrangements 
to emphasize screeched vocals. 
The listener is left with an ominous 
taste in their mouth, but I’m not 
here to review the album. What 
really impacts me is the way her 
music videos for “Lark” and “All 
Mirrors” correspond so precisely 
to the music she makes and her 
overall musical persona. Her music 
videos are an exact expression of 
her music (something I’d categorize 
as 
“glamorous 
doom”). 
They 
correspond to a very specific mood 
of mine, or are viewed when I don’t 
know what mood I’m in. However, 
according to Spotify, her monthly 
listener count on their platform 

is over a million, recognizing that 
even this niche state of mind finds 
an enthusiastic following.
In the video, she bathes in 
noir, 1940s elegance, the drama 
emphasized 
through 
costume 
switches. She changes from a 

structured, pleated gown that seems 
to be made out of white gossamer, to 
a spartan black dress with a small 
touch of lace around the waist. 
Clad in these black folds, she comes 
face to face with another version 
of herself dressed in an enveloping 
black outfit and a dramatic crown 

with pieces of metal shooting like 
sun rays from her head. Finally, 
she slowly spins in a glittery light-
colored dress that completely covers 
her body in shaking, shimmering 
fringe. She emerges from a crowd 
of grabbing hands that hide her for 
a moment with a triumphant air, 
carrying herself tall and proud. 
Yet, her costume changes, from 
light to dark then back again, seems 
to reflect something within herself. 
I’ve always been very attuned to 
clothing, and attempt to dress in 
a way that expresses something 
about myself. As such, watching 
an emotional transition of her’s 
expressed through clothing strikes 
a chord with me. As her Spotify bio 
says, “this record is about owning 
up to your darkest side.” She can be 
powerful while accepting both her 
good and bad sides.
Somehow, this video is sparkly 
and spectacular while also being 
goth and dark. But, even though it 
is severe in its lack of color, it also 
provides a sense of comfort to the 
viewer. The brilliant self-confidence 
and victorious rebirth-type imagery 
incites similar feelings in the viewer 
in a forceful empathetic reaction. 
It is not tailored to any one specific 
gender, but is an empowerment 
message to all. 

Her Macabre Highness

WIKIMEDIA COMMONS

ROSE SOFIA KAMINSKI
For The Daily

“Lady Clementine” is one 
of Marie Benedict’s righteous 
novels focused on unearthing 
the untold stories of prominent 
women in history. All of her 
books center on hidden historical 
stories of women; this fiction in 
particular concentrates on the life 
of Clementine Churchill, the wife 
of well-recognized British Prime 
Minister Winston Churchill. The 
novel follows Clementine and 
her relationship with Winston 
closely, shifting tones from World 
War I, to the interwar period, to 
World War II. 
Using 
Clementine’s 
first-
person 
perspective, 
Benedict 
brings her protagonist to life 
through her intelligent remarks, 
quick wit and observant nature. 
Benedict 
paints 
Clementine 
as incredibly human with her 
candor and the inclusion of 
self-doubt that shapes both the 
book and Clementine’s overall 
life. Despite her insecurities, 
Clementine grows increasingly 
confident in her attempts to stand 
up for what is right, no matter the 
consequence. Her true notable 
role in the British Parliament 
is unveiled within this novel; 
Clementine is much more than 
just a wife to Mr. Churchill, a 
sentiment almost immediately 
clarified by Clementine herself. 
Her story is told in such 
a personal manner that the 
book reads as if it were one 
of 
Clementine’s 
resurrected 
personal diaries. Her struggles 
as a mother and the strains in her 
marriage are only heightened by 
the tension of war, the pressure 
of 
the 
political 
atmosphere 
weighing heavily on her and 
Winston’s 
shoulders. 
This 
constantly 
pushes 
the 
book 
forward with the several layers of 
conflict that Benedict beautifully 

braids together. We are exposed 
to all elements of Clementine’s 
life, and the inclusion of these 
issues makes her story feel as real 
as if it was written during these 
trying times when she was still 
unsure of how her future would 
unfold. Benedict is able to tell 
Clementine’s story knowing the 
results and impacts of the events 
discussed without undermining 
Clementine’s 
own 
fears 
and 
doubts. 
The periods of the book set 
during WWI and WWII were 
most gripping for me; the well-
researched historical inclusions 

of Benedict are enough to pique 
interest, though the usage of the 
perspective of someone as crucial 
yet unknown as Clementine 
Churchill 
permitted 
these 
familiar and tragic retellings 
of war to be told in a new way. 
It was strange reading about 
the events of these wars from 
the perspective of a woman 
since the view of women and 
their plight are often left out of 
history textbooks, along with the 
perspectives of other minority 
groups; regularly ignored by her 
own husband and the majority of 
parliament, Clementine makes it 
her mission to fight for the rights 
of these groups and encourage a 
greater consciousness of all the 

people involved and affected by 
the policies of those with power. 
Nevertheless, 
her 
lack 
of 
power, especially in the face of 
general resentment from other 
political figures, diminishes her 
efforts. The frustration she faces 
routinely sends Clementine into 
sicknesses that cause her to leave 
home in order to recuperate. 
This cycle repeats itself several 
times during the novel and 
leaves Clementine with the same 
anxieties: feeling like a bad wife 
and mother for leaving; dreading 
a return to the draining duties 
required of her to keep the house 
in order, take care of her family 
and continue her work as a 
political correspondent. Though 
understandable, 
her 
frequent 
trips away from her family and 
the 
resulting 
consequences 
slow the plot, taking away from 
the 
otherwise 
eventful 
and 
suspenseful novel. 
The interwar period is not 
as strong overall in comparison 
to Benedict’s tellings of the 
gruesome events of the war; 
there 
is 
less 
happening 
in 
Clementine’s life and the lack of 
action encouraged her repetitive 
spirals. She is a powerful force 
during the wars, called the 
“secret weapon” by Winston as 
she takes on an essential role for 
the advancement of Britain and 
the execution of her husband’s 
demands. Even so, the “secret 
weapon” nickname coined by 
Winston is not as rewarding 
for me as it is to Clementine. If 
anything, it is an accurate label 
for the insufficient recognition 
Clementine 
receives 
for 
her 
pivotal influence. 
Benedict’s goal of highlighting 
the significance of Clementine 
was well-achieved. The blend 
of Clementine’s personal and 
diplomatic endeavors enables an 
engaging atmosphere, especially 
as we enter the tense political 
discourse during the wars where 
Clementine’s most vivid presence 
is portrayed.

Fatigue catching up to Michigan

Prior to Sunday, the Michigan 
women’s basketball team had lost 
just two of its six games without 
senior forward Kayla Robbins 
— both to No. 18 Northwestern, 
both by single digits.
Without 
sophomore 
guard 
Danielle Rauch, who suffered 
a hand injury in practice three 
games after Robbins went down, 
the Wolverines had won two of 
three.
But with the absence of 
Robbins and Rauch, almost every 
other player on the roster had to 
play significantly more minutes 
than they had before. While 
many players were able to handle 
playing more for a while, fatigue 
clearly hurt Michigan in a 62-41 
loss to Rutgers on Sunday. 
Junior forward Hailey Brown 
played over 35 minutes in three 
of the first six games without 
Robbins, and only played less in 
the others due to foul trouble. 
Prior to Robbins’ injury, she 
rarely ever played 30 minutes. 
But despite playing more than 
she ever had, Brown was just as 
effective, shooting 37 percent 
from 3-point range over this 
stretch.
Senior 
guard 
Akienreh 
Johnson averaged 33.5 minutes 
over the six games, a six minute 
increase over her per-game 
average with Robbins and Rauch 
healthy. And with her uptick 
in minutes, she was playing her 
best basketball of the season, 
averaging 13.8 points and 8.3 
rebounds per game, all while 
guarding 
opponents’ 
biggest 
perimeter threat.
“My role has stepped up 
where I have to bring more 
energy,”Johnson said after a Jan. 
26 win over Rutgers. “I have to 
bring the steals that (Robbins) 
got, bring the charges that she 
got, defend the best player like 
she did, get offensive rebounds 
like she did.”
But Barnes Arico knew that 
the players wouldn’t always be 
able to handle playing so many 

minutes as well as they had, and 
she would have to figure out how 
to keep them fresh. 
“We tried to utilize some 
timeouts tonight,” Barnes Arico 
said after a Feb. 6 win over 
Purdue. “I think we made them 
stay seated until the end of the 
timeout. Sometimes we run out 
there a little bit quicker. But 
tonight we were saying ‘Nope. 
Stay here until that horn blows 
and rest your legs.’ ”
While Brown and Johnson 
both stepped up over the six-
game stretch and the Wolverines 
were playing as well as they had 
all season, Sunday against the 
Scarlet Knights the injuries and 
fatigue finally caught up with 
them.
Brown scored just four points 
on 1-for-9 shooting — 1-for-
6 from deep — in 31 minutes. 
Johnson 
scored 
just 
three 
points 
on 
1-for-8 
shooting 
in 36 minutes. Behind these 
performances, Michigan played 
its worst game of the season. It 
shot just 30 percent from the 
floor and got out-rebounded by 
Rutgers, issues only magnified 
by a less-than-full-strength Naz 
Hillmon totaling five points and 
four rebounds.
“There’s definitely a fatigue,” 
Barnes 
Arico 
said 
Sunday. 
“When you look at the minutes 
that we’ve accumulated this 
week, and haven’t really had a 
day off, and I just think it was the 
wear of Rutgers too. It’s a credit 
to them, too. We couldn’t get 

anything to get going offensively, 
and then rebounding, they really 
dominated on the glass, which 
last time we beat them on the 
glass.”
The Wolverines could have 
used Robbins’s ability to get 
tough baskets when not much 
else is working for the offense. 
They could have used Rauch’s 
energy to motivate them at a time 
when they didn’t have much. 
For the first time all season, it 
was clear that Michigan missed 
Robbins and Rauch.
Going 
forward, 
while 
Michigan’s schedule gets easier, 
the team doesn’t have much 
time to recover between games. 
With just two days off between 
Sunday’s loss and a Wednesday 
night game against Illinois, the 
Wolverines don’t have much 
time to rest up and get their legs 
back. Hillmon doesn’t have much 
time to get back to 100 percent.
When Robbins and Rauch 
went down, Michigan knew 
fatigue would become an issue. 
For a while, the Wolverines won 
despite it, but Sunday showed 
that they can’t always rely on 
players like Brown and Johnson 
to play nearly 40 minutes of 
high-quality basketball. 
And if Michigan’s season is 
going to end in a tournament bid, 
it is going to come despite a lack 
of depth. Because with Robbins 
and Rauch not coming back, the 
problem is likely not going away 
any time soon.

Clay’s six goals lead ‘M’ to 16-8 win

It took nearly the entire first 
quarter, but once Michigan’s 
offense clicked, there was no 
turning back. 
The 
Wolverines 
had 
mustered only two goals for 
a majority of the first quarter 
until they finally erupted for 
four in the final 80 seconds. 
Their hot start propelled them 
to a 16-goal outburst. Led by 
dominant performances from 
the attack line, the Michigan 
men’s lacrosse team (2-1) was 
able to cruise to its second 
victory of the year, throttling 
Canisius (0-3), 16-8.
Junior 
attackman 
Kevin 
Mack — who recorded a first 
quarter hat trick — ended with 
four goals on the day. Freshman 
attackman Josh Zawada has 
continued to excel early on in 
his career as he produced two 
goals and four assists. Zawada 
is now tied for the team lead 
in 
points 
with 
sophomore 
attackman Bryce Clay.
Clay, 
who 
boosted 
his 
season total to 13 points, had 
no problems finding the back 
of the cage either as he netted 
six goals. This performance 
not only set his career high, but 
matched the Michigan record 
for goals in a single game. 
Despite his successes, he has 
his eyes set on bigger things.
“It was pretty cool,” Clay 
said. “But I’m gonna focus on 
the team win.”
That 
focus 
was 
exactly 
what allowed the Wolverines 
to dictate every facet of the 
game. They were set up with a 
barrage of opportunities early 
on, largely due to their ferocity 
in the riding game. The Golden 
Griffins managed to clear only 
two of their six chances and 
were plagued by turnovers. 
“The ride really triggered 
our offense,” Michigan coach 
Kevin Conry said. “We weren’t 
clicking on all cylinders in the 
first quarter, and then a couple 
good rides were able to fuel the 
offense.”
Canisius was able to get on 
the board early in the second 
and cut the lead to 7-2 by a pair 

of goals by Mathi Boissonneault. 
This run was immediately put 
to rest by back-to-back goals 
by Zawada to Clay, giving the 
Wolverines a commanding 9-2 
lead. 
They would 
extend 
the 
lead 
to 
11-3 
and head to the 
locker room in 
a 
comfortable 
position. 
One 
of 
the 
biggest factors 
behind 
their 
overwhelming 
first half was 
senior face-off 
specialist Matt Dellacroce. He 
won a remarkable nine of 10 at 
the center x and scooped up six 
groundballs before the break.
While Dellacroce was happy 
with those accomplishments, 
perhaps the most memorable 
one came in the first quarter 
when he buried his first career 
goal. 
“It’s incredible, it’s a long 
time coming,” Dellacroce said. 
“But, I just have to credit that 
to all the practice we’ve done.”
The face-off group has been 
instrumental in his success this 
season.
“We’re 
all 
super 
close,” 
Dellacroce said. “But when it 
comes down to it in practice, 
we’re probably one of the most 
competitive 
groups 
on 
the 
field.”
Michigan would tack on five 
more goals in the third quarter. 
The Zawada to Clay connection 
remained 
unstoppable 
and 
senior 
midfielder 
Christian 

Ford contributed a career-high 
two goals. 
By the start of the fourth, 
the Wolverines were in cruise 
control. 
Their 
16-5 
lead 
allowed Conry to incorporate 
some of his less 
experienced 
players. 
Canisius 
would 
outscore 
Michigan 3-0 in 
the final period, 
but 
the 
game 
had been long 
decided.
Even 
though 
the 
Wolverines were 
comfortable throughout, there 
is still room for growth.
“I just think playing for 
60 full minutes,” Conry said. 
“Especially a young team, we 
have to keep the same intensity 
and the same tempo throughout 
an entire 60 minutes.”
This will be crucial for the 
Wolverines moving forward 
as the schedule ramps up. 
The 
team 
faces 
national 
powerhouses Yale and Notre 
Dame in the non-conference 
and will have to go through the 
gauntlet that is the Big Ten.
“Not letting up off the gas 
pedal,” Clay said. “Especially 
playing in the Big Ten, it’s 
gonna be a dogfight the entire 
game.”
Until then, Michigan has 
its eyes set on a date with 
Merrimack 
this 
Saturday. 
These early tests will serve as 
building blocks for the team 
and its young core.

Team effort leads Wolverines to win

One step at a time. 
It was a simple approach 
but it was all that sophomore 
Maddie Mariani needed to 
propel herself to a career best 
performance on the beam. She 
earned a 9.900 for her routine, 
but none of it came as a shock to 
her coach. 
“Those routines I see from 
her in the gym every single 
day,” 
Michigan 
coach 
Bev 
Plocki said. “I was just glad that 
she was able to get up there and 
compete.”
And it wasn’t just Mariani. 
All the Wolverines stepped 
up to lead the No. 7 Michigan 
women’s 
gymnastics 
team 
(7-0 overall, 5-0 Big Ten) to a 
196.800-195.975 win over Iowa 
(4-6, 1-4) Friday night. 
“This team has just been 
focused all year,” Plocki said. 
“Overall, I’m happy with our 
performance.”
Michigan led off on the 
uneven bars and got out to an 
early lead, 49.250-48.875. They 
were paced by freshman Sierra 
Brooks, who earned a 9.900 
— her best mark in any of the 
four events. Brooks compiled 
a 39.475 to take the all around 

title, her third of the season. 
The team moved to the 
vault and continued to put 
the pressure on. A trifecta of 
Wolverines earned scores of 
9.875 to share the vault title. 
Among them was sophomore 
Abby Heiskell, who scored a 
career best in her first vault 
routine since the opening meet. 
Michigan remained ahead 
98.525-97.875 
through 
two 
events. 
The 
Wolverines 
headed to the 
floor in what 
turned out to be 
their strongest 
showing of the 
day. Freshman 
Gabby 
Wilson 
danced 
and 
tumbled 
her 
way to a 9.900 
to lead the field. 
Michigan claimed four of the 
top five finishes on floor and 
had an overall score of 49.300.
The 
Wolverines 
extended 
their lead to 147.825-146.800 
as they switched to their final 
event — the beam. 
“Before beam we had a team 
meeting,” Mariani said. “We all 
felt super confident going into 
(it).”

It was there that Mariani 
thrived. She blew past her 
previous career high of 9.875 
and flipped her way to a 9.900. 
Her approach was the same 
as 
always. 
This 
time, 
the 
execution was just better. 
“I 
didn’t 
do 
anything 
differently.” Mariani said. “I 
just felt more confident going 
into it.” 
Her 
performance 
sealed 
the deal for Michigan and the 
Wolverines took 
home the win, 
196.800-195.975. 
They 
remain 
undefeated 
and took down 
another Big Ten 
opponent, 
now 
turning 
their 
attention to the 
Big 
Five 
meet 
next 
weekend, 
where 
they’ll 
look to finish unbeaten in 
conference play for a second 
year in a row. 
“We love our record of 

dominance in the Big Ten,” 
Plocki said. “We want to keep 
that string going.” 
Added Mariani: “I’m feeling 
really great about the team. 
We’re definitely coming for 
that regular season title.”

The Michigan women’s basketball team lost to Rutgers, 62-41, on Sunday.

Hutchins hoping for improvement

Michigan is perfect — in 
record, at least.
The Wolverines are 9-0, 
ranked No. 8 in the country and 
have outscored their opponents 
by a total of 25 runs. Three 
of the nine wins have come 
against ranked opponents. At 
first glance, the numbers are 
impressive; signs of a team 
playing elite softball, even 
against high tier opponents. 
But it’s not good enough.
Not 
for 
coach 
Carol 
Hutchins.
The team needs to improve. 
And it has plenty to improve 
upon, according to its coach.
“I didn’t think we were 
very sharp,” Hutchins said. 
“We missed at least four or 
five opportunities that were 
all but routine pop flys. And 
bunts. We made a couple errors 
there.”
The 
miscues 
were 
mainly attributed to lack of 
communication and lack of 
experience. Michigan has a 
new catcher, a new second 
baseman, a new first baseman 
and a new third baseman. On 
top of that, juniors Lou Allan 
and Taylor Bump are splitting 
time at first and third base. 
The only returning starting 
infielder is junior shortstop 
Natalia Rodriguez.
The 
remedy 
to 
the 
inexperience: live situations.
Hutchins noted that live 
drills have been an integral 
part of practice this week to 
address the errors in the field. 
They forced the players into 
communicating and making 
plays together, gearing them 
up for the upcoming weekend. 
While fighting through the 
growing pains, the infield has 
looked to Rodriguez, its pillar 
of consistency.
“I’m going to have a lot of 
voice in the infield,” Rodriguez 
said. “Taking charge on plays 
and stuff like that. Some of 
my teammates say I’m like a 

common presence, so I try to 
maintain that on the field.”
As a member of Hutchins’s 
designated leadership team, 
this is expected of Rodriguez. 
Notching nine putouts and 11 
assists in Michigan’s first nine 
games with a 1.000 fielding 
percentage, she leads through 
her play as well 
as 
her 
voice. 
Knowing 
this, 
Rodriguez 
takes it upon 
herself to help 
her teammates 
improve.
“I 
look 
to 
push 
my 
teammates,” 
Rodriguez said. 
“It’s good for a 
competitive drive. I want the 
people next to me to excel in 
their game.”
While 
Rodriguez 
helped 
to answer the team’s fielding 
problems, Hutchins was also 
working on the other side of 
the ball.
“I think offensively we keep 
trying to get better,” Hutchins 
said. “I don’t think we’re 
hitting as well as we need to 
hit. We let a lot of pitches get 
away from us.”
The struggle has led to run 
droughts and close games for 
Michigan. Four of its nine 

wins were only by one run. 
One of those was a 1-0 win 
against Fresno State in the 
ninth inning, a game that could 
easily have been lost without 
dominant performances from 
junior 
left-hander 
Meghan 
Beaubien 
and 
sophomore 
right-hander Alex Storako. 
Hutchins 
believes 
the 
Wolverines 
need to improve 
every 
pitch. 
She’s 
preached 
her 
one 
pitch 
mentality to her 
team the entire 
season. 
She’s 
materialized 
the mentality in 
practice, having 
the batters take single pitch at 
bats. A ball or a hit? You win. 
Anything else? You’re out.
The Wolverines are staring 
down the pipe at matchups 
against five top 25 teams in the 
next two weeks, including the 
No.1 and No. 2 teams — UCLA 
and Washington, respectively. 
As Hutchins sees it, Michigan 
will have to be better.
The path to this improvement 
is known throughout the team.
“You’ll hear Hutch say it over 
and over again,” Bump said. 
“One pitch softball, one pitch 
softball, one pitch softball.”

Mann thrives in sweep of Spartans

Monday 
night 
at 
Little 
Caesars 
Arena, 
Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson took his 
seat at the podium of the media 
room and got right to it. Not 
long 
before, 
the 
Michigan 
hockey team raised a trophy 
in celebration of a three-goal 
victory over Michigan State at 
the Duel in the D. But with the 
red carpet rolled and put away, 
Pearson became critical and 
turned to his team’s fortune.
“I’ll just start off by saying 
that 
I 
thought 
we 
were 
fortunate 
tonight,” 
Pearson 
said. “I didn’t think that was 
one of our better efforts, but 
we found a way to win the 
game.”
And behind the Wolverines’ 
fortune was Strauss Mann.
Despite Michigan’s 4-1 win, 
the 
sophomore 
goaltender’s 
stellar 
performance 
was 
critical. He faced 32 shots 
and saved all but one. There 
were moments Monday where 
it seemed he could stop just 
about anything.
With under seven minutes 
to go in the second period, 
the 
Spartan’s 
defenseman 
Cole Krygier fired the puck 
at the left side of the net. The 
low slot was crowded, yet 
Mann blocked the shot. The 
puck immediately bounced to 
forward Brody Stevens near 
the right side of the crease. 
A goal looked inevitable, as 
Stevens stared at the gaping 
right side. But just as Stevens 
swiped his stick at the puck, 
Mann fully extended his left 
blocker to deny the goal.
And then a few minutes later 
Mann was at it again, this time 
with an even more sublime 
save.
Forward Nicolas Müller got 
the puck at the far right side 
of the low slot. Mann hovered 
at the right edge of the crease, 
waiting for the shot. When 
it came though, sophomore 
forward Garret Van Wyhe 

extended his stick to deflect it.
The puck slid to forward 
Josh Nodler at the other side of 
the slot. Because of the sudden 
deflection, Mann was totally 
out 
of 
position. 
Everyone 
awaited the buzzer, but it 
never came. As soon as Nodler 
released his shot, Mann dove 
across and blocked it with his 
stick. 
The puck then ricocheted 
off his own helmet and headed 
back towards the net. It clanked 
off the right post and was just 
about to slide past the red line 
when Mann, who lay flat on 
his chest after the initial dive, 
and sophomore forward Nolan 
Moyle cleared it away.
“Strauss Mann making a 
hell of a save for us,” senior 
forward Jake Slaker said. “So 
that’s good to see.”
Added senior forward Will 
Lockwood: “I don’t know how 
it stayed out, honestly. He does 
that at practice day in and day 
out, so you know, we’re kind of 
used to it at this point. But you 
see it live like that, it’s pretty 
spectacular.”
Mann’s .935 overall save 
rate has him ranked sixth 
in the nation. As one would 
expect, that average has had its 
variation. He started the new 
year hot, saving 95.8 percent of 
shots through five conference 
games — the series against 
Notre Dame and Penn State 

plus a Friday game against 
Ohio State.
Through the Saturday game 
against the Buckeyes plus the 
following 
weekend’s 
series 
against 
Wisconsin, 
Mann 
struggled a bit. He gave up 10 
goals over those three contests, 
saving just 90.3 percent of 
shots.
In the most recent series 
against the Spartans, though, 
Mann was back at the pinnacle 
of his game and notched a 
stellar .966 save rate. And it 
came at a crucial time.
Pearson 
mentioned 
that 
Michigan 
State 
arrived 
in 
Detroit the night before, giving 
the Spartans time for a practice 
skate to be fully prepared 
come game time. Michigan, on 
the other hand, did not come 
early — some of the players 
were even taking tests Monday 
morning. Thus, switching into 
a hockey mindset became more 
difficult. Perhaps a result of 
this, the Wolverines struggled 
with puck possession at times 
during the game, especially on 
the defensive end.
They were all the more 
fortunate to have Mann there 
to back them up and lead them 
to a signature sweep.
“This has been his best 
performance of the second 
half tonight,” Pearson said 
after Monday’s game. “And we 
needed him.”

Injuries pave way for improved depth

At the beginning of the 
Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 
team’s season, roster depth 
was a serious question swirling 
around these Wolverines. It 
seemed as if three players — 
junior forward Isaiah Livers, 
senior 
point 
guard 
Zavier 
Simpson and senior center Jon 
Teske — would have to carry 
the team.
That hasn’t exactly gone 
according to plan. 
Livers was sidelined with a 
groin injury in late December 
and reaggravated it against 
Illinois a month later. On Sunday 
against Indiana, he appeared to 
injure his ankle — he’s currently 
wearing a boot as a precaution, 
and it’s unclear whether he’ll 
play at Rutgers on Wednesday. 
Simpson was given a one-game 
suspension at the beginning of 
the month for a traffic violation. 
Teske has been slumping lately, 
putting up double-digits just 
once in the last five games and 
shooting 30 percent.
Early in the season, any one 
of these could have been a major 
problem for Michigan. 
Now, 
while 
missing 
production from one of these 
three is still less than ideal, the 
Wolverines have figured out a 
way to get by — and then some, 
thanks to their bench play.
“Now that the season has 
progressed, and we’ve dealt 
with injuries and suspension, 
guys have to step up,” Michigan 
coach Juwan Howard said. 
“That 
allowed 
guys 
like 
Brandon Johns, David DeJulius, 
and others — Austin Davis, too 
— to have a larger role with the 
team. I’ve felt we were deep 
from the beginning.”
To 
bolster 
the 
interior 
offense amid Teske’s struggles, 
Michigan has turned to his 
fellow senior center, Austin 
Davis. Though this is the first 
season in which Davis has 
seen significant playing time, 
he’s been making his presence 
known in the last few games. 
“Big Country is hooping,” 
Livers said, grinning, last week, 
referencing Davis’ nickname. 

Davis 
notched 
nine 
points 
against 
both 
Indiana 
and 
Northwestern and a career-
high 11 against Ohio State at 
the beginning of the month. 
He’s also usually good for 
somewhere 
between 
three 
and five rebounds in around 10 
minutes a game.
“He’s 
improved 
so 
much,” 
Teske 
said. 
“He’s 
always 
been 
there. He works 
hard every day, 
and 
you 
just 
want to get him 
attempts 
here 
and there. 
“I’m so proud 
of 
him 
and 
happy for him. To be able to 
get his chance now — he’s been 
taking with it and running with 
it. These last couple games, 
he’s been our sparkplug. I’m so 
proud of how hard he’s worked 
and what he’s done so far.”
When 
Livers 
has 
been 
sidelined, sophomore forward 
Brandon Johns, Jr. has stepped 
into the starting role. It was a bit 
of an adjustment, but Johns has 
been finding his stride lately. 
He scored 14 points against the 
Hoosiers on Sunday and put up 
a career-high 20 two weeks ago 
against Rutgers in New York, 
a performance Michigan will 
hope he can repeat when the 
Wolverines travel to Piscataway 
to face the Scarlet Knights again 
on Wednesday.
Howard has been preaching 
confidence to Johns all season, 
and the results have been clear 
in Johns’s game lately. It’s in 
the way he carries himself, both 
on and off the court: shoulders 
squared, head high, eyes clear. 
He’s self-assured, and he has 
every reason to be. He’s taking 
more shots, and more of those 
shots are falling. 
“He’s been solid all year, 
man,” Howard said after the 
Indiana game on Sunday. “He 
has one of the prettiest jump 
shots. I wish I could shoot the 
ball back in the day like Brandon. 
He’s another guy that comes in 
practice and is always trying to 
look for ways to improve. We’ve 

seen the guy, this season, he’s 
just blossoming, game after 
game. 
“With 
this 
energy 
and 
effort, the way how he attacks 
the glass, with his force, his 
athleticism, and now he’s flying 
around, being active, that’s 
him. That’s who he is. He’s our 
energizer.”
Of 
the 
three 
starters, 
Simpson 
perhaps 
least 
requires 
a 
capable 
backup. It’s not 
uncommon 
for 
him to play the 
entire 
game, 
or close to it. 
But that hasn’t 
been 
happening 
as 
much 
lately, 
as 
sophomore 
guard 
David DeJulius has taken on 
a bigger role — he started at 
Nebraska when Simpson was 
suspended — and more minutes; 
he’s averaging a little over 20 
minutes per game.
DeJulius 
is 
making 
the 
most of that time. He’s finding 
opportunities 
for 
himself, 
putting up 10 points against 
Michigan State while facing 
Cassius Winston, one of the 
best point guards in college 
basketball. But in true point 
guard form, he’s also starting 
to find them for his teammates; 
he 
had 
seven 
assists 
at 
Northwestern last week. 
“I’m 
trying 
to 
make 
improvements each and every 
day,” DeJulius said. “Being more 
confident in that leadership 
role, just in case (Simpson) goes 
down, or gets in foul trouble, 
or for any reason, it’s just being 
able to be prepared for the 
moment. I feel like being able to 
make plays not only for myself 
but for my teammates has 
always been my game.”
Obviously, Michigan would 
like to have Simpson, Livers 
and Teske at their best. But 
going forward, if that’s not the 
case for whatever reason, the 
Wolverines are in good hands. 
This bench, shaped by the 
adversity of a midseason slump, 
is more than prepared to bolster 
the team going forward.

Hajjar shows value in quality start

As Steven Hajjar boarded 
the bus for the half hour drive 
between Salt River Fields and 
the Phoenix Municipal Stadium, 
his adrenaline was pumping and 
his nerves were racing.
The 
left-handed 
redshirt 
freshman had waited a year for 
his first start after a knee injury 
sidelined him last season, but on 
Saturday he was given only 30 
minutes to prepare. 
Because 
the 
Michigan 
baseball team made an already 
challenging week even harder by 
adding a game against then-No. 
3 Arizona State, the Wolverines 
were forced to expedite their 
pregame routine and skip their 
scouting report. 
“I was waiting a long time to 
go out there and play with the 
guys,” Hajjar said. “(I) got to 
watch all last year all the success. 
It was great to finally be a part 
of it and be out there with the 
guys. Obviously Arizona State is 
a really good team.”
The odds were stacked against 
Hajjar. He was facing a team 
with some of the top hitters in 
the country in his first collegiate 
start while the defense behind 
him was about to play in the 
second game of a double header.
Hajjar was nervous — and 
rightfully so. 
But the lefty delivered a 
performance that put all of his 
prior nerves at ease. 
In his first opportunity to 
prove his worth and show his 
potential to earn a spot in the 

rotation, 
Hajjar 
pitched 
six 
innings and did not allow a single 
run. 
After the Sun Devils got three 
quick outs in the top of the first, 
Hajjar struck out the first two 
batters he faced — two up, two 
down. 
Even more impressive given 
who the second batter was — 
Arizona State’s junior Spencer 
Torkelson. He is also known as 
the No. 1 college prospect in the 
2020 MLB draft, according to 
Baseball America, and a two-
time unanimous All-American. 
The Pac 12 home run leader 
from 
a 
year 
ago 
struck 
out 
swinging. 
Arizona State’s 
biggest 
threat 
was neutralized. 
All 
said 
and 
done, Torkelson 
would go 0-for-3 
on the day with 
a walk. 
With the help 
of what Hajjar 
described as an “absolute brick 
wall” of a defense behind him, 
the first inning was over. The 
nerves were lessened and Hajjar 
began to grow more and more 
comfortable with each inning. 
Despite growing more relaxed 
throughout his outing, his game 
plan remained steady and simple. 
“I just try and go out there and 
throw strikes as best I can and 
compete,” Hajjar said.
A simple game plan, but one 
that he followed with great 
accuracy. Over the course of six 
innings, Hajjar faced 23 batters 

and only threw 87 pitches. That’s 
good for an average of 3.78 
pitches per batter. 
After losing starting pitchers 
Tommy 
Henry 
and 
Karl 
Kauffmann last year — putting 
a major hold in the pitching 
rotation — Hajjar proved that 
he has the ability to get outs 
against some of the best hitters 
in the country in a high-pressure 
environment. 
The 
biggest 
question coming in to the season 
is replacing the second spot. 
Hajjar isn’t expected to become 
Michigan’s ace, a spot most likely 
saved for junior right-hander 
Jeff Criswell, but 
he 
showed 
on 
Saturday that he 
has the abilities 
to 
be 
a 
solid 
weekend starter 
and 
possibly 
become the No. 2 
guy. 
The 
first 
inning went as 
well as anyone 
could 
have 
expected. But the true impact 
of Hajjar’s debut came when 
he faced adversity in the later 
innings. In the second inning, 
allowing a walk and a hit with 
two outs, Hajjar earned his 
third K of the day, stranding two 
runners on base. 
In the fifth inning, with the 
Wolverines leading 2-0, Hajjar 
allowed 
two 
singles 
and 
a 
sacrifice bunt to advance both 
runners into scoring position 
with only one out. However, the 
Sun Devils were unable to make 
strong contact with the ball. The 
next two batters flew out to end 
the inning. 
Hajjar’s seven strikeouts and 
three hits propelled him to win 
his first Big Ten Freshman of 
the Week and Big Ten Pitcher 
of the Week awards. His four 
pitch repertoire of low 90 MPH 
fastballs, slider, circle changes 
and curveballs proved to be 
nearly unhittable for some of the 
best batters in the country. 
With only 30 minutes to 
prepare, Hajjar couldn’t have 
asked for a better start. There’s 
no telling what his ceiling might 
be given more time to prepare.

I

n March 2019, I found a YouTube video titled “How 
to Remember Your Life” that proposed the unthink-
able: The only way to remember your life is to delete 
your photos. Instead of keeping hundreds of vacation pho-
tos, you whittle them down to a few and turn your camera 
roll into a highlight reel. Each photo becomes more precious 
than before, a real documentation of your memories rather 
than a dump of disconnected moments.
I felt increasingly anxious as the video progressed. I’ve 
accumulated thousands of photos and videos over the years, 
documenting every fleeting moment, and even the thought 
of deleting them seemed insurmountable to me. It would 
feel like erasing my own life.
Deleting photos felt like cleaning my bedroom as a child 
when I hoarded anything that resembled a memory — even 
if it was a broken doll part or an expired gift card. Once in 
fifth grade, when my floor was covered by at least four lay-
ers of clothes, my mom marched upstairs with a trash bag 
and waded through the mess to throw things out. Years-old 
receipts, paper snowflakes and scrap fabric all mercilessly 
went in the bag. I sobbed and told her I was saving them for 
something, though I wasn’t sure what, and wrote a scathing 
entry in my diary: “My life is ruined.” 
Though I believed I’d grown out of my hoarding phase, 
finding that YouTube video made me realize I’m still in it. 
Even today, I would feel as if my life was ruined if I lost my 
pictures. But it isn’t just about the photos, just as my hoard-
ing as a child wasn’t about keeping paper scraps — it was the 
fear I’d forget the moments associated with them. It wasn’t 
about the objects, it was about the memories.
I 

think I’m a memory hoarder. This means I collect 
memories like inanimate objects, clinging to them 
out of fear of forgetting my life. I need to document 
everything as accurately as possible in case I want to expe-
rience it again — otherwise, my life would feel like a collec-
tion of single-use moments, waiting to be thrown away after 
living them just one time.
I’m a photographer, which makes it much easier for me 
to hoard memories. I can capture moments closely to how 
I experienced them, find the right angle and edit them to 
match reality, then re-visit the photos as many times as I’d 
like. I regret the shots I don’t take if I have the chance.
But my position creates a paradox: Does taking a picture 
help you remember a moment, or does it distract you from 
experiencing it?
I lived in Costa Rica this past summer and brought my 
professional camera everywhere, including when my 
friends and I went horseback riding. As our horses twisted 
their way up the green hills of Monteverde, I gripped my 
camera, leaning back in my saddle and steadying my hand 
despite the gallop of my horse. I put my eye to the viewfind-
er and searched for the perfect angle.
When we got to the top of the hill, I got about two min-
utes with the full, magnificent view — and spent the entire 

time taking photos. I was desperate to capture 
the scene correctly, to finally get to enjoy the ride, 
because the only way I can stay in a moment is if 
I know I’ve captured it already. But by the time I 
got the shot, the ride was over.
By now, I’ve spent more time looking at the 
photos from horseback riding than I did actu-
ally experiencing it. Though I can still picture 
the scene from how my eyes authentically saw it, 
those memories are slowly being replaced with 
the photo representations. My fear of forgetting, it 
seems, might actually stop me from remembering.
I

n the 2012 movie adaptation of “The 
Secret Life of Walter Mitty,” Walter Mitty 
finds Sean O’Connell, a traveling film 
photographer, searching for a rare snow leopard 
in the Himalayas. When it finally walks in view 
of his lens, Sean leans away from the viewfinder. 
Walter asks when he’ll take the photo. 
“Sometimes I don’t,” Sean responds. “If I like 
a moment ... I don’t like to have the distraction of 
the camera. I just want to stay in it.” The leopard 
passes without any documentation.
The scene frustrates me each time I watch this 
movie. Isn’t there a way to capture the moment 
and still experience it? Doesn’t he want proof? 
Still, I identify with his distaste for the distrac-
tion — I wish I could have taken photos in Costa 
Rica without having to sacrifice the experience of 
those moments. 
I’ve dreamed of the day when I can take a pic-
ture with just my eyes, like the episode of “Black 
Mirror” where humans have cameras in their 
brains. In the show, though, this leads to their 
downfall as they obsessively watch their lives 
over again, to the point where it’s difficult to justify creating 
new memories.
Though we don’t have the technology to make this a 
reality yet, it seems as though the concept is already a 
trend — we aren’t shooting on film with 24 shots to a roll, 
but instead, we have phones with increasingly high-quality 
cameras, connected to the seemingly-infinite storage of the 
internet. We have GoPro travel videos and 20-minute daily 
vlogs generating quick clicks for influencers. The urge to 
capture is always there because the bounds are limitless for 
what we can remember.
I began using social media as a way to create a highlight 
reel of my favorite moments without having to sort through 
my camera roll. But now, it’s transformed into something 
different; memories become capital to be liked and shared, 
or to appear on Timehop and be reminded of past memo-
ries. In a way, it isn’t just the camera that distracts you, but 
reviewing those moments is also another distraction.
Maybe memory hoarding is just the norm now, and it’s 

better to miss some moments if it means you’ll have a digi-
tal archive of your life. Or maybe it’s just the new nostalgia, 
more enticing to capture than not, and we’ll never know 
how much our digital memories will paint over the analog.
D

uring my last week in Costa Rica, I had to leave 
my camera behind when I went snorkeling in a 
coral reef. I remember almost every minute of 
those two hours swimming with my face in the water, drift-
ing past sea urchins and vibrant fish as if I was part of their 
habitat. I was immersed — the only filter between my eyes 
and the water was my goggles, not the viewfinder of a cam-
era. I was free to absorb the scene without inhibition.
Though I don’t have a photo to relive the experience, it’s 
still a vivid memory. Maybe I should have tried to bring 
my GoPro, or maybe it’s better to let the memory live and 
die organically. Sometimes you want the distraction of the 
camera, and sometimes you have to let the leopard walk by. 
Either way, the best memories will always find their way in. 
You just have to let them.

H

er mother said she was sorry 
that she hadn’t been there to 
protect her daughter, and that, 
of all the places she had warned her about, 
the post office wasn’t one of them,” read 
a news report of her death.
On 
Sept. 
4, 
2019, 
about 
2,000 
people dressed in black were gathered 
in the University of Cape Town’s plaza. 
Directly below Devil’s Peak, one of Cape 
Town’s most iconic features, the space 
usually hums with students eating lunch 
or taking a break between classes. And 
if they’re lucky, the sun is still high over 
the mountain. That day was sunny — I 
remember because I’d worn my only black 
pants and they stuck to my legs — but on 
that September afternoon, the plaza was 
the site of a vigil. 
Uyinene Mrwetyana was a first year at 
UCT who, like thousands of women across 
the world, was a victim of femicide, or 
the killing of a woman on account of her 
gender. She’d gone to a post office to pick 
up a package and instead was locked in 
the office, raped by the post office worker, 
beaten with a set of postal scales when she 
wouldn’t stop screaming, then hidden in 
the trunk of a car until her burned body 
was dumped in a township outside the city. 
I’m not sure I have ever written a more 
horrible sentence. Maybe this one is worse: 
This kind of violence is not uncommon in 
South Africa and elsewhere. 
The statistics are horrifying. South 
Africa has one of the highest rates of rape 
in the world, and it ranks fourth, out of 183 
countries, for femicide. About every three 
hours, a woman is murdered within the 
country’s borders. 
Uyinene — or just Nene, as her friends 
called her — had been missing since Aug. 
24. Someone had posted flyers around 
campus, and I wish I could say that I’d 
done something when I saw them — that I 
wasn’t just another person who glanced at 
them and moved on. But I was. 
The school sent out a string of emails 
over a few days: It was confirmed that Nene 
was the victim, that memorial services 
would be held on campus and later, when 
the administration realized how angry 
the student body was, classes would be 
canceled the rest of the week. 
My literature tutor, UCT’s equivalent of 
a GSI, emailed us: “Tomorrow’s schedule 
has officially been suspended by Prof. 
Phakeng. Take this time to mourn, heal, 
and protest if you are able to. As students 
of the Humanities, you are in a position 
to bear witness to and take action against 
human rights violations. I encourage you 
all to engage, in whatever capacity you are 
able to, in the events planned in Uyinene 
Mryetwana’s memory tomorrow. 
“Take care of yourselves and be safe, 
especially if you are going to Parliament. 
Wear sunscreen, bring plenty of water and 

snacks, and charge your phones.” 
My friends gathered in our living room 
to decide what to do. In Ann Arbor, news 
like this would fly through GroupMe and 
Slack threads; I imagined the explosion of 
all the WhatsApp groups we weren’t in. 
My housemates Dinte, Hannah, Maaike 
and I found an Instagram story with plans 
for a march on Parliament and a memorial 
at school. Wear black, it said. It’s OK if 
you’re angry, or grieving, or too upset to 
come at all. 
O

n the day of the memorial, I 
stood in the plaza, on the right 
edge of the crowd. Sunflowers, 
proteas, calla lilies and a hundred other 
flowers spilled off the corner of the stage, 
the only bright spot in a sea of black. The 
crowd began singing in Xhosa and Zulu 
as we waited for Nene’s family to arrive. 
My Dutch friends and I swayed to the 
beat of songs we couldn’t understand. As 
outsiders to this group, our presence was 
the only thing we had to give. 
University 
students, 
faculty, 
administrators and Nene’s family all 
spoke that day. After the memorial ended, 
a protest began. Girls read speeches and 
poems, most of them while crying, but 
then something shifted. The sadness 
became outrage. The whispering became 
yelling. Gone was the murmuring from 
the crowd — it was time for anger. Girls 
began sharing their stories of assault and 
harassment with the crowd. They spit 
their most private, horrifying moments 
into the microphone: having to jump out 
of an Uber after being groped, boyfriends 

thinking their relationship was a free pass 
to their bodies, running across campus at 
night after exams. 
We watched woman after woman cry 
at the podium, then pull herself together 
because people needed to hear what 
happens to women every day, in public 
and in private. I pulled out my phone to 
record a girl describing when her Uber 
Eats driver told her to come get her food 
from the car, only for two of his friends to 
jump out of bushes, trying to drug her. She 
ended up in the intensive care unit. I saved 
the recording, whispering to Dinte that I 
was going to play it for Nico and Jonathon, 
the rest of our group of friends, who’d 
spent the day surfing. I was angry with 
Nene’s attacker, with rape culture and 
with them for not caring. We sat in the sun 
for four hours and listened to these women 
because that’s all we could do. They needed 
to know someone cared about them and 
their story, so we stayed even after most of 
the crowd had gone home. I didn’t want to 
watch another woman cry, but I knew that 
if I were in her position, I’d want another 
person quietly watching, giving witness 
while I spoke. 
When it was finally over, we walked 
down the steps, watching students dressed 
in black disperse across campus. Most 
went to the bus stops, some walked to 
Lower Campus, the rest got in cars or, like 
us, called Ubers. When our car arrived, 
pulling up at the bottom of the steps, we 
checked the license plate numbers before 
getting in. He noticed our black clothes 
and asked about the protest.

“My daughter knew Uyinene,” he said. 
“She hasn’t come out of her room.” 
We told him we were international 
students, that we didn’t know many people 
there but needed to go to the protest. In 
the passenger seat, I thought about how 
small the world is. In a city of nearly half a 
million people, our Uber driver’s daughter 
knew Nene. In a world of over seven 
billion, gender-based violence preys on 
women everywhere.
He dropped us at Cafe Ganesh, a little 
restaurant in our neighborhood. We 
quietly ate roti and falafel salads, reaching 
across the table to share food. Dinte, who 
always knows what to say, stayed silent, 
and I noticed her eyes pooling with tears. 
She leaned her head against the wall and 
closed her eyes, already apologizing. 
“Today was hard. I’ve been thinking about 
a lot of things.” She told us a story about her 
and her boyfriend. The details are hazy and 
they aren’t mine to share. We sat in silence 
as she cried, and then Maaike broke it with 
her own story. I offered one and Hannah 
followed. All four of them were different, 
but every girl has something.
While I waited for the news to go 
international, I debated telling my parents. 
Photos of Uyinene, the protests and anger 
choked my Instagram feed, but on the 
other side of the world, it was silent. I told 
a couple of friends about the attack when 
they asked how I was doing, then regretted 
saying anything. It was overwhelming to 
explain and underwhelming to read their 
responses. What is anyone supposed to 
say? 
I decided there was no point. I was being 
as safe as I could. The next time I had to 
run errands, I asked my friend Jake to 
come with me — Jake, who was tall but 
gangly, and better at cracking jokes than 
intimidation. Coordinating two schedules 
just to go pick up my hiking boots my mom 
had mailed was frustrating. Knowing I 
was only safe if an attacker thought I was 
another man’s property was more so. 
After Nene, though, it was foolish to go 
anywhere alone. Even such a public place 
as a post office. 
These attacks don’t happen because 
women aren’t being safe, they happen 
because men choose to attack women — no 
matter where they are, what they’re doing 
or time of day. My parents were 8,000 
miles away. Half of me figured that if it was 
going to happen to me, it would, and there 
wasn’t much I could do about it. The other 
half knew my privilege, especially abroad. 
When I went to catch a campus bus and 
realized they’d gone on strike, I could 
afford to call an Uber in seconds. My house 
had a gated door. I could leave the country 
at any moment, if need be. I felt safe in my 
own home and was surrounded by people I 
trusted. I’m white.

Paradise and reality aren’t so far apart


T

he words poured over the crowd 
gathered on the Diag like a warm 
blanket, 
our 
collective 
voices 
growing in volume and conviction: 
Bless those in need of healing with re’fuah 
shlemah 
the renewal of body,
the renewal of spirit
and let us say, amen.
The Mi Sheberach — a Jewish prayer — 
pleads for complete physical and spiritual 
healing. It is sung to help those we know and 

those we don’t. It is sung for Jews and non-
Jews. My aunt sings it every time she sees an 
ambulance speed by. It’s a hymn of immense 
pain and effortless beauty, and in that 
moment on the Diag, as hundreds gathered to 
mourn an event that had shaken many of us 
to our core, it fully embodied both.
One day prior, on Oct. 27, 2018, Robert 
Bowers, a white supremacist, walked into 
the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh and 
opened fire, killing 11 people and wounding 
six others. After he was apprehended, Bowers 

reportedly told officers “that he wanted 
all Jews to die” and that “(Jews) were 
committing genocide to his people.” 
“Screw the optics,” Bowers wrote on Gab, 
a social media platform popular among white 
supremacists, hours before the attack. “I’m 
going in.” 
I was born over 50 years after the end of 
World War II, when the height of fascism in 
Europe led to the systematic extermination 
of six million Jews in the Holocaust. In the 
time immediately following the war, anti-
Semitic attacks dissipated. For many in 
my generation, anti-Semitism was more 
theoretical than reality; we heard about it, 
read about it, knew it existed but rarely saw 
it in our day to day lives.
We are taught from an early age, in books 
and history courses, that learning about 
our collective past informs the present 
and predicts the future. It’s a truism in our 
culture. But perhaps we cannot understand 
the value of this currency until we’ve lived 
it. The turbulent history of Judaism follows 
a through line of oppression and bigotry. To 
count the groups that have sought to exclude 
or remove us would be a tireless task.
I knew this history. I attended Jewish day 
school for nine years, participated in Jewish 
youth groups throughout high school, joined 
a Jewish fraternity upon arriving at the 
University of Michigan and held Judaism 
central to my identity along the way.
The Pittsburgh shooting was a glass-
shattering moment for me — an abrupt 
confrontation with the lively threat of Jewish 
hatred. Nationally, it was an awakening to 
the rise of modern anti-Semitism in the U.S., 
much of which is subtle, some of which is not. 
According to the Anti-Defamation League, 
the jump in anti-Semitic attacks from 2016 
to 2017 was the largest increase in American 
history, from 1,267 anti-Semitic “incidents” 
to 1,986 “incidents.” That number has largely 
leveled off in the years since, establishing 
a startling norm. The incidents ranged 
from swastikas painted in public spaces to 
shootings at Jewish centers. Bowers’s attack 
was the most extreme, but it was not an 
outlier.
The best way to remedy this pain is 
through community, a central aspect of 
Jewish culture. That was how I found myself 
on the Diag that day, holding up my phone 
flashlight in the cold, dreary drizzle. I looked 
around and saw dozens of my friends. We 
hugged. Some cried. It was brief, but healing. 
As such, I knew why I was on the Diag 
mourning the loss of people I did not know, 
alongside our shared community. Though 
unofficial, the University of Michigan Hillel 
website estimates there are approximately 

6,500 Jewish students at U-M, accounting 
for roughly 14 percent of the student body. 
In the United States as a whole, Jews make 
up just 1.9 percent of the population.
What I did not know was how: How, 
exactly, did the primary state school in 
Michigan, which has the 23rd-highest 
percentage of Jews in the nation, become a 
hub for Jews all over the country? How did 
this random Midwestern school find itself on 
lists of top Jewish schools? 
What I came to understand through 
researching this central question in books, 
articles, interviews and documents was that 
simply learning that history was too narrow. 
We all must confront a more uncomfortable 
question, 
one 
that 
extends 
beyond 
understanding where we come from.
Why should we care?
N

early 100 years ago, Harvard 
University 
President 
Abbott 
Lawrence Lowell sat in an office 
somewhere in Cambridge, Mass., and 
pondered a solution to his “Jewish Problem” 
— a phrase with deep historic origins. 
“The essence of the ‘Jewish Problem’ was 
how to control the influx of Jews into areas 
of social activity that were predominantly 
Protestant,” wrote Stephen Steinberg in 
Commentary Magazine.
Higher education, to that point, was one of 
those spaces.
By 1922, Jews made up over one-fifth of 
Harvard’s freshman class, with some reports 
indicating that number reached as high 
as 27 percent by the mid-1920s. There were 
just over three million Jews in the U.S. at the 
time, accounting for less than 3 percent of the 
population. Families who fled from pogroms 
and anti-Semitic violence across the globe 
in the late-1800s and early-1900s had begun 
to place a foothold in the system of higher 
education. 
That influx led to an unease within 
the 
education 
system. 
Leaders 
like 
Lowell worried about the disruption a 
disproportionate Jewish population at elite 
universities might cause.
“We learned that it was numbers that 
mattered; bad or good, too many Jews were 
not liked,” Harry Starr, an undergraduate at 
Harvard at the time, recalled to the Jewish 
Virtual Library. “Rich or poor, brilliant or 
dull, polished or crude — (the problem was) 
too many Jews.”
What ensued was an informal but 
systematic 
quota 
system 
created 
to 
quell Jewish enrollment at Harvard and 
other Ivy League schools. According to a 
2005 profile from Malcolm Gladwell titled 
“Getting In,” the Harvard admissions 
office poured through its student records 
in the 1920s to assign its students a 
designation — “j1” for someone who was 
“conclusively” Jewish, “j2” where there was a 
“preponderance of evidence” of Jewishness, 

“j3” for the “possibility” of Jewishness.
Gladwell writes that Princeton sent 
representatives to competitive boarding 
schools in order to rate potential candidates 
from 1 to 4 on “desirability” based on physical 
appearance and other subtle factors that 
could hint at a Jewish background. Yale 
began to center physical appearance with its 
applicants. Masculinity. Height. Charisma. 
Background. All euphemisms, all deliberate. 
The process was quiet but effective. In order 
to limit Jewish overflow, these schools had to 
change the definition of merit entirely.
By the end of Lowell’s term at Harvard 
in 1933, Jewish enrollment had dropped 
to 15 percent. Yale cut down to 10 percent. 
In 1986, Yale publicly admitted in a book 
titled “Joining the Club” that it perpetuated 
discrimination on the basis of religion for 
several decades. A memo from the admissions 
chairman in 1922 titled “Jewish Problem” 
implored limits on “the alien and unwashed 
element,” according to a New York Times 
article. It also solidified prior historical 
understanding that Yale limited its student 
Jewish population to 10 percent for over 40 
years.
“There were vicious, ugly forms of 
discrimination at Yale, as with the larger 
society,” the then-University Secretary at 
Yale, John A. Wilkinson, told the New York 
Times. “It’s part of our history, and we should 
face up to it.”
During 
the 
same 
time 
frame, 
the 
University of Michigan’s Jewish population 
began to grow rapidly. Though U-M has 
never asked about religious affiliation 
directly on its application or campus surveys, 
University of Michigan Hillel and academic 
estimations shed light on this growth.
From 1915 to 1936, the timeframe in which 
many Ivy League schools were believed to be 
implementing Jewish quotas, U-M’s Jewish 
population grew from just over 200 students 
to nearly 1000, according to the Ira Smith 
Papers and Student Christian Association. 
That amounted to an increase from 5 percent 
of the student body to 10 percent in a relatively 
short period of time. 
So it’s intuitive to connect the growth of 
the Jewish community at U-M, the one that 
gathered in the Diag after the Pittsburgh 
shooting, to the discrimination at Ivy 
Leagues: The community I’ve socialized 
with, lived with, cried with, sung with. 
It’s logical, given that context, to lift the 
University on a pedestal; to laud a history 
of tolerance and perseverance; to exude 
unabashed pride. This is a reputation the 
University touts. The Michigan difference. 
Leaders and the best.
Tossed in the middle of the fourth 
paragraph of the “History” section of 
the University of Michigan’s Wikipedia is a 
lofty sentence along those lines:
“The University became a favored choice 

for bright Jewish students from New 
York in the 1920s and 1930s, when the Ivy 
League schools had quotas restricting the 
number of Jews to be admitted.”
“These schools are suddenly seeing all 
these Jewish students and saying ‘We don’t 
want this many Jewish students,’ ” Karla 
Goldman, a Judaic Studies professor, told me. 
“So do they come to Michigan?”
Then a pause and a sigh.
“Um…”
G

oldman sits in the back corner 
of her fourth-floor School of 
Education 
office 
and 
pores 
through 
spreadsheets. 
She 
shows 
me 
yearbooks from the 1930s, in which she 
scours home addresses, parental information 
and occupations in order to establish highly-
educated guesses about who was Jewish.
Documents and books line the walls, her 
computer tucked in the back left corner, 
enclosed by a fortress of miscellaneous 
papers. It’s got a real Robin Williams’s-office-
in-“Good Will Hunting” kind of vibe.
But Goldman’s focus is narrow. She’s spent 
months researching the very question I’ve 
come to ask her: Is there definitive proof that 
U-M’s robust Jewish community originates 
directly from the quotas at Ivy League 
schools in the early to mid-20th century?
And before those words can even depart 
my mouth, she dives in.
“There is some part of University of 
Michigan oral history lore, when it talks 
about itself as a diverse institution, that points 
to that time. That while these Northeast elite 
schools were excluding Jewish students that 
Michigan welcomed them,” Goldman says, 
careful to leave causation at an arm’s length. 
“It’s kind of an informal history, so people 
will mention that.”
She continues.
“I think it’s very likely that the quotas 
at a lot of northeastern schools created a 
movement of northeast Jews, in particular, 
sort of looking farther west than they 
otherwise would have — that’s likely. The 
thing we don’t know is: What was the status 
of Jewish students at Michigan? Are we 
assuming there weren’t quotas? There’s not 
the same kind of smoking gun evidence thus 
far.”
It’s clear she’s spent a considerable amount 
of time in search of that “smoking gun” 
evidence, and is as disappointed to share as I 
am to hear that no such evidence exists. 
“I mean, it was really serious work they 
did at Harvard, Princeton and Yale to keep 
Jews out, and many other schools,” Goldman 
said. “We don’t see that effort here. That’s 
interesting. (And) it’s not that we don’t see 
anti-Semitism. We see it.”
One such area in which anti-Semitism 
crept into the admissions realm was graduate 
school applications. While, again, there was 
no direct invocation of religious affiliation 

on the application, it is clear Jews were at 
a disadvantage given the large number of 
Jewish applicants U-M’s graduate schools 
received annually.
In one case, now publicly available, a 
recommendation for a Jewish dental school 
applicant makes explicit reference to that 
double standard.
“Mr. (redacted) is Jewish but not the loud 
offensive type of Jew,” the recommendation 
said. “He is courteous, pleasant, courteous 
of others and very hard working. … So I am 
hoping that he will be admitted in spite of his 
Hebraic origin.” 
In 1935, two students were expelled for 
something the school categorized as “radical 
behavior.” Both students were from the New 
York area. It’s widely understood, though 
not explicitly stated, that both were Jewish, 
according to Goldman. The expulsions 
sparked an internal discussion about forming 
a quota at U-M, limiting the number of 
students from New York and New Jersey 
— the backbone of the out-of-state Jewish 
population at U-M.
“And it’s clear they were discussing: 
Should we limit these Jewish students who 
come here and tend to be radical?” Goldman 
said. “They decide not to do it.”
At this time, the same infrastructure of the 
Jewish community that exists today began 
to take shape. The University of Michigan 
Hillel — the central hub for Jewish social 
and academic programming — was founded 
in 1926, becoming the third Hillel on the 
continent. At the time, Jews were isolated 
to the same dormitories (often Mosher-
Jordan Residence Hall). Jewish fraternities 
and sororities formed, as the sole source for 
Greek life inclusion for Jewish students. In 
the 1933-1934 school year, for example, the 
84 students who self-identified as “Jewish” 
in Greek life were the sole members of seven 
fraternities on campus. In the 41 other 
fraternities, not a single member identified 
as “Jewish.” Alignment of sorority members 
followed a similar spread.
Slowly, overt anti-Semitic acts that were 
once commonplace began to dissipate. 
Jewish 
quotas, 
anecdotally, 
ceased 
to 
exist by the 1960s. As campuses continued 
to diversify demographically, Jews began to 
pass as white, gaining many of the privileges 
that come with it. Harvard in the 1920s, for 
example, almost exclusively comprised of 
white Protestants and Jews. As colleges 
become a melting pot for people of all races, 
ethnicities and religions, it became harder to 
stigmatize Jews as “the other.”
Anti-Semitism in the modern context 
exists more subtly. Many of those flashpoints 
on campus manifest through the blurred lines 
of good-faith critiques of Zionism and bad-
faith swipes at Jews writ large. The Trump 
administration’s Executive Order, one issued 
under the guise of Title VI of the Civil Rights 
Act, complicates those matters by blanketly 
conflating all anti-Zionism as anti-Semitism, 
and by unilaterally categorizing Judaism as a 
race.
These defined identities only muddle 

conversations, much of which manifests in 
campus environments.
“I’ll tell you what my hope is, my wish is, 
for a college environment,” Goldman said. 
“Instead of being the place where we have 
these flashpoints of conflict, we’re actually 
all here together, could this be the place 
where we actually are able to engage each 
other in ways that aren’t possible elsewhere 
in society?”
I

n academic terms, Goldman’s venture 
is a noble one. The history of the 
Jewish people — one littered with 
oppression and perseverance — extends to 
the higher education system some take for 
granted today. She wants to know whether 
U-M’s self-image of acceptance holds true. 
She’s interested in proving whether the 
causal claim at the core of Jewish community 
at U-M passes muster. I am, too.
But why should students who may not have 
grown up in New York or New Jersey, or may 
not be Jewish, care about the origins of the 
strong Jewish community at U-M? That was 
the question I posed to Goldman near the 
end of our conversation, and one I’d grappled 
with plenty.
“It both reshapes our sense of what that 
time was, the presence of anti-Semitism in 
spaces that we’re used to thinking as very 
comfortable, very easy presence,” Goldman 
said. “So there’s that. We also tend to think 
of the university as a very static thing. But it’s 
not, it’s changed so much.” 
“And then when you begin to think of 
inclusion now and exclusion. … You have to 
think about, well, in what sense is university 
meant to be an institution for privilege — a 
place to perpetuate privilege, which it is. 
But also, to what extent is it meant to be a 
place that creates opportunities as a point of 
access for people who start without a lot of 
privilege.”
That last point stuck with me. In 2018, a 
group sued Harvard for discriminating 
against 
Asian 
students 
in 
admissions 
processes, claiming it weighted race too 
heavily in admissions processes at the 
expense of merit. It was, once again, a 
challenge of affirmative action. The suit, 
though hardly a facsimile of the claims 
about Jewish quotas in the 1920s, resurfaces 
difficult questions about merit. Who belongs? 
Who does not? Who gets to make that 
distinction? We are all here, on this campus, 
because that determination about us was 
made in the affirmative. Acceptance. Are we 
willing to grapple with why?
These difficult questions are ones those 
with the privilege of existing in higher 
education are not forced to confront. They 
are questions that have persisted for decades 
and will continue for many more.
They are not questions I, nor my peers, 
considered on the Diag when we sang, 
reveling in the intense healing of community.
But we’re here and we’re singing the Mi 
Sheberach and that, in itself, is an immense 
luxury. 
If only for a moment, all that matters is not 
where we’ve been, but where we are.

Was Michigan an answer to the ‘Jewish Problem’?


Wednesday, February 19, 2020 // The Statement
6B

I

t was early February, and a woman 
with short brown hair was leading 
me through a long, twisting hallway 
in the Student Activities Building. I held 
my coat in my arms, feeling stunned until 
we arrived at an empty office with just a 
chair and a sad, barren desk. Once inside, 
the woman directed me to sit at a small, 
round table as she took her place in the 
chair at the desk behind me, watching. 
“You have one hour,” she said. It seemed 
like a short time to look at everything 
and take notes by hand, as phones were 
prohibited during this process. Before 
I could get a word in, a stack of papers 
was placed in front of me: my college 
admissions file. 
I had this meeting in my calendar 
for a month, and I had been anxiously 
awaiting it. When the semester started 
back up in January, I heard whispers 
about University of Michigan students 
requesting to view their admissions file, 
sparked by a YouTube video uploaded by 
a student at the Ross School of Business. 
I was intrigued and wanted to investigate 
further, so I let myself fall into a dark hole 
of YouTube videos and Reddit threads. 
Similar videos existed of students from 
other schools reacting to their admissions 
files, and reactions across them were 
mixed — there were both positive and 
negative 
evaluations. 
Reddit 
threads 
vaguely described the process, with some 
users warning others about imposter 

syndrome. 
I 
felt 
apprehensive 
and 
considered avoiding this whole process, 
but my curiosity was too strong. When I 
came out of my mini investigation, I came 
to a decision: I was going to request to see 
my admissions file. 
The ability to view college admissions 
files is nothing new. Through the Family 
Educational Rights and Privacy Act — 
more commonly known as FERPA — 
schools are required to provide students 
who currently attend the school with 
access to their educational records if they 
request it. This includes law enforcement 
records, 
employment 
records 
and, 
of course, admissions files. Once a 
student requests these records, FERPA’s 
guidelines require the school to comply 
within 45 days. 
Though FERPA was signed into law 
by President Gerald Ford in 1974, I didn’t 
know much about the process until 
stumbling upon Jack Liu’s video earlier 
this year. Last year, my senior year of high 
school, college seemed so far away. The 
possibility of seeing my admissions files 
was something I hadn’t thought about 
until I was on campus. 
When I was in the process of applying, 
college admissions always seemed like 
a secretive process, but the lawsuit filed 
by a group of Asian American students 
against Harvard University re-opened the 
conversation 
around 
the 
college 
admissions 
process, especially since it has forced 

Harvard to reveal the factors that their 
admissions office considers. Additionally, 
ever since a group of anonymous Stanford 
University students came forward and 
urged others to request their records 
through FERPA in 2015, students have 
grown more curious — the University 
of California, Berkeley, for example, 
reported that they had experienced 
a spike in file requests shortly after the 
Stanford news. In recent years, there has 
been more and more coverage that details 
how FERPA allows students to request 
their admission files, which has likely led 
to a rise in requests. 
The decision to see your file is a hot 
topic, too. While many students on the 
internet, like University of Pennsylvania 
student Christy Qiu, appear to recognize 
that the act of viewing their admissions 
files was revealing to an extent and 
promotes transparency, there are still 
those who caution people from doing so. 
Many of the comments I read on Reddit 
warned fellow students from viewing 
their files because it might lead to feeling 
demoralized. Seeing yourself on paper, 
evaluated by people who have most likely 
never met you, can be a disheartening 
process. 
When I spoke to some University 
students about the admissions process, 
it was clear students felt similarly. “The 
college admissions process gave me a 
ton of anxiety,” LSA freshman Anya 
Dengerink-Van Til said. “I don’t want to 
reawaken those anxieties.” 
I’ll admit that even though I felt 
confident about wanting to see my file, 
I was still nervous about it. There was 
definitely something terrifying about 
reading what people thought of me. After 
all, I find even regular criticism to be hard 
to accept at times; I even get hurt when my 
mom tells me she doesn’t like the sweater 
I’m wearing. But there was a part of me 
that feared something beyond criticism 
— a part of me that wondered if I was 
somehow lesser than those who had been 
accepted before me, especially because I 
had been deferred. 
There was one thing that pushed 
me to go forward with seeing my 
application. I was far enough away 
from that version of myself to view the 
file somewhat objectively; even if it was 
only a year ago, I felt different from the 
girl who had filled out all those forms 
and written all those application essays. 
A year ago, I was insecure, and more 
than anything, I cared about how I 
looked in comparison to other students. 
I wanted to seem like the best. Passions 
came second. But a lot has changed 
between then and now. My mentality 
about school is completely different — 
I attend class because I want to learn, 
and I pick my organizations because I 
genuinely care about them. 
Back at that small, round table, I flipped 

through the papers anxiously. Any actual 
evaluations made by the admissions 
office were at the bottom of the stack, 
compiled into two pages; the majority 
of the papers were printed pages of my 
Common Application. My extracurricular 
activities, 
grade 
point 
average 
and 
test scores were listed multiple times 
throughout the file, accompanied by a few 
handwritten comments. One admissions 
officer in particular had specifically 
pointed out two of my extracurriculars, 
in which I held a position of leadership 
in, specifically: Model United Nations as 
head delegate and National Honor Society 
as an officer. Both of these, from what I 
could tell, seemed to be good examples 
of leadership, which made me an “EXC 
stud.”: Excellent student. 
This was something that struck me. In 
high school, Model UN was important to 
me. It was one of those clubs that helped 
me grow more confident with public-
speaking, which I’d always felt insecure 
about. NHS, on the other hand, never felt 
personal to me. Sure, I was proud to have 
been elected as an officer by my class, but 
it felt obligatory — especially at the time 
— and I had never experienced personal 
growth in NHS like I had in Model UN. 
Seeing those two extracurriculars next 
to each other as if they were equal felt 
absolutely bizarre to me. Yet, they were 
there, right in front of my eyes and printed 
in ink. 
As I continued through the admissions 
officers’ evaluations, there was another 
comment that stuck out to me. Each 
admissions officer ranked me with a 
single digit number. It was printed next 
to my name, twice, above each section of 
their comments. To me, it was clear that 
it was a ranking. But there was no way of 
knowing what it meant. It didn’t say what 
the number was out of or if it was simply 
a doodle from a bored admissions officer. 
Was it meant to be a score? Why was I 
that number and not another one? And 
was it a good thing, or a bad thing? There 
was no way of telling, and the uncertainty 
terrified me. 
For some time after, I lingered on the 
number that haunted my admissions file for 
a bit. The mystery behind the number was 
somewhat uncomfortable, but I quickly 
realized and accepted there was nothing 
to be done about it. Besides, I reasoned, at 
this point it’s not as if it matters. Seeing 
that number hadn’t changed anything 
about myself in the present, and it’s not as 
if they had actually ranked me as a person 
with those numbers. They had ranked 
me as an applicant — an amalgamation of 
test scores and clubs and leadership roles. 
Regardless of their comments, evaluations 
and rankings, I still have pride in who I 
am. I am still a thinker, a writer, a friend 
and a student. Regardless of admissions, 
I will continue to grow and establish my 
place here.

I

t was recital day, and all of my stu-
dents were lined up backstage; these 
girls formed a perfectly straight line, 
no taller than my knee. I had been teaching 
dance since I was an adolescent so I knew 
what I was doing. My ballet teacher — whom 
I so badly wanted to impress, even though 
no matter how hard I tried, she would never 
compliment me — smiled at the sight. She 
loved lines, especially straight lines. She 
examined the girls as she approached me, 
and she invited me to admire how small 
all the girls were while they adjusted their 
frilly lavender tutus. She squatted with an 
exaggerated grunt to pick up one little girl 
with brown skin, big brown eyes and messy 
curly hair. 
“This one,” she started, “this one is 
dense. Small, but dense.” She 
paused, waiting for me to agree. I 
watched in disbelief as this child, 
who looked a lot like me, cocked 
her head to the side in confu-
sion, her limbs dangling like dead 
weight. 
I knew what my ballet teacher 
meant. She picked out the girl 
with brown skin in a line of white 
faces, only to lift her up and down 
and mock her for her weight, and 
I could tell she had done it many 
times before with other girls. I 
wanted to cover the child’s inno-
cent ears — she was four years old 
and already being subjected to the 
beauty, race and weight ideals of 
the dance world. I wanted to look 
at my teacher straight in the eye 
and tell her the damage she was 
causing, but I pretended I had not 
heard her comment while a hard 
lump formed in my throat. 
I thought back to when my 
ballet teacher opened up about 
her past struggles with anorexia 
as a young dancer. Thirsty to 
achieve perfect lines in both her 
technique and her physique, she spilled 
every detail to us in between barre exer-
cises about how she would not eat until her 
stomach growled with pain. When she said 
this, she looked straight at me. 
There’s an unspoken truth in the per-
forming industry, a long-kept secret that 
artists and producers discuss behind closed 
doors: The lack of diversity and visibil-
ity in the performance industry from body 
shape to ethnicity to gender. It’s pointed 
out by directors on admissions boards at 
the University and by top casting direc-
tors when they are thinking of quick fixes 
to the diversity problem. However, these 
problems can only be solved with systemic 
change and courage. 
As a performer and arts journalist, I 
become increasingly frustrated every time 
I enter a rehearsal room or sit in a plush 

theater seat to watch the same stories being 
told over and over again — stories of white 
suburban families, whitewashed stories of 
cultural happenings. 
I grew up in dance studios where tight 
leotards clung closely to my newly formed 
curves, and the surrounding mirrors ampli-
fied my image and mocked me for my devel-
oping shape. My brown skin and curves 
stuck out from the pale skin and thin bod-
ies of my peers. Unlike them, I felt like I had 
no one to look up to in the ballet or modern 
dance world. No one who looked like me. 
As my physical body grew, so did my shame 
for the shape of my new womanly form; my 
body was a terrain with hills and valleys 
that no leotard from Capezio’s dancewear 
store would contain. 

I entertained dreams of becoming a pro-
fessional dancer — taking masterclasses 
with the Rockettes and with “Newsies” 
men — but there was a voice in the back of 
my head that told me there would be no way 
that I could make it in that world. It wasn’t 
made for me. 
The professional performance world is 
where straight hair transforms effortlessly 
into a tight, neat bun atop one’s head. It is a 
place full of people who fit into any leotard 
they pick off the rack at Capezio. There is 
no room for girls whose first thought when 
choosing a leotard is, “My God, I hope this 
can hold in my boobs.” There was no room 
for my thick, curly hair that weighed down 
my messy bun, which gave me headaches 
and pulled me down during pirouettes. 
I feared a world where I would audition 
for Joffrey or Martha Graham. I didn’t have 

the lines they were looking for. The panel 
would take one look at the fat on my stom-
ach and my breasts, scoff and not even both-
er to look at me dance. I accepted that as a 
fact because, as a young artist, everything 
seems so out of reach — so much bigger than 
only you. 
I stopped dancing. In my mind, I was 
making the choice to stop living in a fan-
tasy world where curvy, brown-skinned 
girls like me could dance in serious ballet 
or modern dance company stages. I love to 
dance, but every time I looked at myself in 
the mirror, it was a reminder of why I could 
never make it.
I 

was raised on Broadway and books. 
I grew up getting lost in the magical 
“Wicked” soundtrack, felt love and 

heartbreak through the musical journey of 
“The Last Five Years.” 
The 2008 musical “Next to Normal” edu-
cated me about mental health issues and 
taught me that musicals do not all have to 
sound like Disney princess movies with 
light, airy instrumentals and simple melodic 
motifs sung in a fluttery tone. 
I buried my nose in the “Junie B. Jones” 
books and turned to the philosophies of 
Dr. Seuss when I was in crisis. I constantly 
ransacked Barnes and Noble for the next 
best book, where I was introduced to “One 
Hundred Years of Solitude,” the Greek clas-
sics and random poetry books. Words rang 
in my mind like musical lyrics. I learned that 
I hate Hemingway.
Those are the memories I hold closest to 
my heart: reading a chapter book in my bed 
all day, unable to put it down, becoming the 

characters I read about or getting lost in the 
velvet seats of a Broadway theater, imagin-
ing myself on the big stage. Theater was 
the manifestation of the wonderland that 
existed in my head. Theater showed me 
there was a way to make all the stories I read 
about come to life — from “Alice in Wonder-
land” to “The Lords of Discipline,” anything 
could be made for the stage. There were no 
limitations to live theater; it was like seeing 
a book being read in front of me. 
My whole life, I watched the experiences 
of others play out right in front of me; how-
ever, it wasn’t until I saw “In the Heights” 
in middle school that I finally felt heard. 
Familiar characters who shared my cul-
tural identity took the stage, and the sound 
of the clave echoed through the Richard 
Rodgers Theatre. I was ecstatic to 
see others around me having fun 
watching a reflection of my life on 
stage. The characters were finally 
articulating my own feelings: the 
experiences of being a Latina in 
New York City and a proud daugh-
ter of immigrants. For the entirety 
of my childhood, I never consid-
ered the possibility my own story 
was worth sharing on a Broadway 
stage.
Experiencing “In the Heights” 
helped me find my voice, liter-
ally and figuratively. I thought: I 
don’t have to be skinny or white 
to have a nice singing voice, 
right? Who said I couldn’t audi-
tion for Broadway? I auditioned 
for my dream school, a perform-
ing arts high school named Fio-
rella H. LaGuardia High School 
located in NYC. When I got 
accepted into the voice depart-
ment, I knew it was my turn to 
tell others my story with my 
newly-found medium. 
However, somewhere along 
the way in high school, I lost 
sight of the story I was supposed to be 
telling: my story, the one of a short, curvy, 
Latina who gets cast as a lead in a Broad-
way show, or the first one of her kind to 
make it onto the Rockettes. Mine was 
supposed to be the story of breaking the 
mold, but as I found myself struggling to 
find a sense of belonging in a mostly-white 
school, I no longer felt like I deserved to be 
heard. It was like being back in dance class 
again, surrounded by people who look 
nothing like me, who seem so carefree 
walking into audition rooms with confi-
dence that you can only get from growing 
up with money and never being told “no.”
