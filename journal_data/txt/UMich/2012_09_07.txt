Change takes
time, Obama
argues at DNC

President accepts
Democratic
nomination, urges
support
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporter
Challenged by Republicans to
prove that the country is better
off now than it was four years
ago, President Barack Obama
offered a "better path forward"

as he accepted the Democratic
nomination for president Thurs-
day night.
In a speech that lasted about
40 minutes, Obama cast the
presidential election as a deci-
sion between two critically dif-
ferent ideologies for how to
tackle America's most challeng-
ing issues. While acknowledging
that progress has been sluggish,
he promised that with more time
vast change willbe made.
"I won't pretend the path I'm
offering is quick or easy," Obama

Adds that 'U' alum
Blau will succeed
him in leading real
estate firm
By PETER SHAHIN
Daily StaffReporter
University alum Stephen M.
Ross, the namesake of the Uni-
versity's Ross School of Busi-
ness, said in an event at the

Business School on Thursday
that he will step down next
week as CEO of The Related
Companies, the real estate firm
he founded. He announced that
the company's president Jeff
Blau, also a University alum,
will take over as CEO.
Every one of the 499 seats
was filled at Blau Auditorium,
with students and guests spill-
ing into three of the Business
School's conference rooms, as
Ross and Blau lounged in arm-
chairs and fielded questions

ranging from job prospects for
business graduates to the state
of the Miami Dolphins, the
NFL team Ross owns.
But, the surprise of the
hour-long presentation came
in a truly unscripted exchange
between Ross and Blau over
the future of Related's manage-
ment, when Ross said he will
leave his position as CEO and
will be replaced by Blau. '
"I'll be the first to tell you
that next week we're announc-
ing he's the CEO and I'm just

the. chairman -you'll read
about that next week I'm sure,"
Ross said. "Just don't tell the
press, with social media it's
going to be all over the place."
Both Blau and Ross declined
to comment after the event
when asked about the person-
nel change. Representatives
from Related did not respond to
requests for comment.
Ross didn't say *hy he
is leaving his position, and
it's unclear when an official

Republican presidential

DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION
Students among delegates

GROOVIN'

Clinton, Obama
speeches among
highlights for Dems
in Charlotte
By CHANNING ROBINSON
Daily StaffReporter
Several University students
made the trek to Charlotte, N.C.
this week to participate in the
Democratic National Conven-
tion and show their support for
President Barack Obama and
the Democratic Party.
LSA sophomore Daniel Elkus

attended the convention as a
delegate from Michigan's 9th
district. Elkus said he tries to
be as politically involved as
possible to represent the inter-
ests of the campus groups he
participates in, including the
University's chapter of College
Democrats, the American Civil
Liberties Union, Hillel and the
United Cerebral Palsy of Metro-
politan Detroit.
Of the numerous speakers,
he said former President Bill
Clinton - who gave a fervent.
address urging Obama's re-elec-
tion - and Bob King, president
of United Auto Workers, were
particularly impressive.

"Bill Clinton gave an excel-
lent speech about the future of
the nation ... and showed it is
impossible
to gov-
ern under
licans,"
Elkus said.
LSA
junior
Jacob
Light also referenced Clinton's
speech as one of the convention
highlights.

Google transition nears completion

About half of 'U'
students have
migrated services
By MOLLY BLOCK
Daily StaffReporter
As students settle into the new
school year, the University is also
getting acclimated to its new
Google e-mail platform.

The University's migration
from Internet Message Access
Protocol - its previous webmail
program - to Google is almost
complete, according to officials.
By the end of September, all
IMAP e-mail accounts will auto-
matically change to M+Google,
the University's personalized
Google platform.
The switch was pioneered by
the University's NextGen Michi-
gan Collaboration project, which

was officially launched on March
5, giving the Ann Arbor campus
access to more than 40 Google
collaboration applications.
According to Rita Girardi,
senior marketing and communi-
cations specialist for the Next-
Gen program, M+Google differs
from a standard Gmail account
in its lack of advertising and its
integration with existing Univer-
sity tools such as MCommunity,

European Bank
unveils plan to
save the Euro

Central Bank
plans to buy
ulimited number
of bonds
FRANKFURT, Germany
- The European Central
Bank unveiled its most ambi-
tious plan yetto ease Europe's
financial crisis with a plan
to buy unlimited amounts of
government bonds to help
lower borrowing costs for
countries struggling to man-
age their debts. I
Large-scale purchases
of short-term government
bonds would drive up their
price and push down their
interest rate, or yield, taking
some pressure off of finan-
cially stressed governments
such as Spain and Italy.
"We will have a fully effec-
tive backstop to avoid destruc-
tive scenarios," ECB President
Mario Draghi said at a press
conference, in which he also
defended the euro currency
union as "irreversible."
After the ECB plan was
announced, the yields on gov-
ernment bonds across Europe
fell and stock markets rallied.
"This is a potential game-
changer," says Jacob Kirkeg-
aard, research fellow at the
Peterson Institute for Inter-
national Economics. "This
is the first time the ECB has
committed its balance sheet
in this way. And the way it is
done is politically sustainable
in Europe."
The ECB's 23-member
governing council' approved
the plan with only one dis-
sent. The head of Germany's
Bundesbank, Jens Weidma-
nn, opposes the plan, arguing
that the ECB is moving too far
in the direction of financing
government deficits, which is
prohibited by the European
Union treaty.
The ECB's pledge of sup-

port came with an important
caveat: Countries that want
the central bank to help with
their borrowing costs must
first ask the 17 countries that
use the euro to buy their
bonds with existing bailout
funds and they must submit
their economic policies to the
scrutiny of the International
Monetary Fund.
That puts immense pres-
sure on financially stressed
countries such as Spain and
Italy - which have been reluc-
tant to seek help from their
euro partners - to take the
next step. Both countries face
borrowing rates that are in the
upper range of what's sustain-
able over the long-term.
Spanish Prime Minis-
ter Mariano Rajoy refused
Thursday to make any com
mitment to trigger the ECB
bond-buying. "When I have
something new, I'll tell you,"
he told reporters at a press
conference that was held
after he met with German
Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Italian Prime Minister
Mario Monti praised the plan
as an "important -step for-
ward" but said any decisions
on Italy's potential request for
aid were "premature."
If Spain and Italy were
to accept aid from the euro-
zone's bailout funds, it would
put them in the same com-
pany as Greece, Ireland and
Portugal - something the two
countries have been wary of.
An earlier ECB effort to
drive down rates by buying
bonds was limited in size -
the ECB spent 210 billion
($264 billion) - and did not
have lasting impact. The ECB
ended that program Thursday.
The ECB first said its new
bond-buying plan was in the
works on Aug. 2, and markets
have climbed steadily since
then. Investors across the
globe greeted the release of a
more detailed plan with fur-
ther enthusiasm.

MARQUETTE, Michigan
State unveils new'
Olympic themed
license plate
Michigan is offering a new
license plate for motorists to
show their support for the
nation's Olympic athletes.
Secretary of State Ruth John-
son on Wednesday announced
the availability of the plate. The
redesigned plate features bolder
USA lettering and the phrase
"Go Team USA" along the bot-
tom.
It replaces Michigan's exist-
ing Olympic design that was
introduced in 1995.
Olympic gold medal-winning
gymnast Jordyn Wieber says in
a statement the plate "is a great
way to say, 'Go Team USA!'
Wieber is from the Lansing-area
community of DeWitt.
KANSAS CITY
Catholic bishop
failed to report
pedophile priest
The first American bishop
criminally charged in the cler-
gy sex abuse scandal was found
guilty Thursday of a misde-
meanor count of failing to report
suspected child abuse, a convic-
tion that extends the struggle
of Roman Catholic leaders to
restore trust in the church.
Bishop 'Robert Finn was
acquitted on a second count.
He received two years.of proba-
tion, but that sentence was sus-
pended and will be wiped from
his record if he adheres to a set
of conditions that include man-
datory abuse reporting training,
setting aside $10,000 in diocese
money for abuse victim counsel-
ing, and instructing all diocesan
agents to report suspected crim-
inal activity involving minors.
Finn and the Catholic Dio-
cese of Kansas City-St. Joseph
were each charged with two
misdemeanor counts of failing to
report suspected child abuse to
the state. Prosecutors said they
dropped charges against the dio-
cese, and the judge is expectedto
sign off on that Friday.
NEW YORK
Stock index soars
to pre-2008 levels
The last time the stock market
was this high, the Great Reces-
sion had just started, and stocks
were pointed toward a headlong
descent.
But on Thursday, the Dow
Jones industrial average hit its
highest mark since December
2007, and the Standard & Poor's
500 index soared to its high-
est level since January 2008 in
a rally that marked a milestone:
American stocks have come
almost all the way back.
A long-anticipated plan to
support struggling countries in
the European Union provided
the necessary jolt, and the gains
were extraordinarily broad. All
but 13 stocks in the S&P index

were up. European markets
surged, too.
TOLEMAIDA, Colombia
Colombia rejects
peace proposal
from rebel group
President Juan Manuel San-
tos on Thursday night rejected
a proposal by Colombia's main
leftist rebel movement to observe
a cease-fire during peace talks
that are to begin next month in
Norway.
Leaders of the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia, or
FARC, said hours earlier dur-
ing a news conference in Cuba
that their first item on the nego-
tiations' agenda would be to pro-
pose a truce in the half-century
of fighting that has killed tens of
thousands.
Santos said that would not
happen. He said the Colombian
military and police had been
instructed to intensify offensive
actions against the rebels.

say, at this point in time, they
view their scarce resources as
more effectively devoted to other
states. They just have a limited
amount of money, and they've got
to be smart in how They spend it."
Super PACs American Cross-
roads and Americans for Pros-
'perity recently committed $13
million to spend on advertising
in key swing states, so the deci-
sion to end Romney's advertising
campaign in Michigan may sug-
gest that his campaign is placing
less focus on winning the state in
the November election, accord-
ing to The News.
Poll numbers released by
Public Policy Polling on Sept. 3
indicate that Obama is currently
carrying a 7 point lead in Michi-
gan.
The destination for the con-
servative groups' funds may be
states such as Florida, Ohio, Col-
orado, Virginia or North Caro-
lina - battleground states that
Heaney said are more contested
and more electorally significant
than Michigan.
Political Science Prof. Vin-
cent Hutchings agreed, adding
that other swing states are more
important to Romney's election
chances and President Barack
Obama's re-election.
"(Romney) really needs Flor-
ida and Ohio; it's a little hard to
see him winning without both
those states," Hutchings said.
"But he doesn't really need
Michigan, and frankly, neither
does the president."

from last week," Light said.
"You couldn't help but be excit-
ed and enthused as he delivered
the speech of the night."
Light compared the con-
vention's excited mood to the
enthusiastic support Obama
garnered at the 2008 conve-
tion.
Recent polling data indicates
the November election will be a
close race, Political Science Prof.
Michael Heaney said. He added
that he expects the youth vote
to be a determining factor in the
election's outcome.
"The polls show it's basical-
ly an even race," said Heaney.
"Very few people are undecided.
The trick is getting the few that
wouldn't participate, to partici-
pate."
Light said he attended the
convention to continue foster-
ing student support for Obama,
noting that the student voice is
increasingly important thisyear.
"I thought it was really
important to go, to show that
young people really support
the President and the work he's
doing for us," Light said.
Elkus said he will be vot-

Like Romney and conser-
vative groups, Obama and his
backers have spent little on
advertising in Michigan, accord-
ing to Hutchings. He added that
the lack of Michigan funding
seems to be a sign that neither
campaign expects the state's
vote to be close.
"(Obama's) not going to spend
a lot in Hawaii or in California,
and by that token, Mitt Romney's
not going to spend a lot in Utah
or in South Carolina," Hutchings
said. "That's because they're not
competitive. To the extent that
Michigan becomes non-com-
petitive, then neither candidate
is going to spend much money
here."
In spite of the withdrawal of
advertisements here in Michi-
gan, LSA senior Jared Boot,
chair of the University's chapter
of Students for Romney, said the
group will continue advocating
for the GOP candidate. He said
the group will continue to make
telephone calls to garner support
for Romney every Thursday.
"I still think the race (in Mich-
igan) is competitive," he said.
Matt Frendewey, spokesman
from the Michigan Republi-
can Party, also told The News
that Romney, who was born
and raised in Bloomfield Hills,
Mich., is not ceding the chance
to become the first Republican
presidential candidate to win
Michigan since former President
George H.W. Bush in 1988.
"The last two credible polls
showed Michigan in play," said
Frendewey. "We recognize we're
the underdog and we have to
compete hard to win."
ing for the Obama-Biden ticket
based on the pair's track record.
"I'm voting Democrat and for
Obama because of what he has
done to improve the life of the
average American," Elkus said.
Specifically, Elkus cited the
Affordable Care Act - the com-
prehensive health care reform
plan passed under Obama in
March 2010 - as a transforma-
tive piece of legislature.
"Obama has done so much for
people like myself with cerebral
palsy by passing the Afford-
able Care Act and eliminating
pre-existing conditions," Elkus
said. "As a delegate, I see myself
as a voice for the disability com-
munity whose worlds would
be turned upside down by the
Romney-Ryan plan."
- Light said he will cast his
presidential vote Democratic
not only because of what his
administration has accom-
plished the past four years, but
because of the strength of the
convention's message.
"This convention has
marked the Democrats going
on the-offensive ... we have the
direction for the future and
for the next four years," Light
said. "It's really the future
that we are electing (bama)
for."

GOOGLE
From Page 1A
the University's online directory.
Girardi said the new Google
platform aims to establish more-
efficient and collaborative tools
for communication within the
University. The Dearborn and
Flint campuses will also move to
M+Google this fall, she added.
"This effort is about much
more than e-mail and calendar,"
Girardi said. "It's about working
together more effectively and
easily. We're already seeing how
Google collaboration tools are
changing the way we work."
According to Girardi, the Uni-
versity also has plans to inte-
grate more existing tools with
the Google platform. She said the
hope is to sync Wolverine Access
calendars and class schedules
with Google, though this change
will require software changes to
Wolverine Access, which won't
happen immediately.
Though Girardisaid the change
will likely be significant for many
faculty members who have used
the old program for awhile, she
said she's not concerned that stu-
dents will have difficulties with
the new interface.
"The move to M+Google for
e-mail and calendar is a big

change, especially for those facul-
ty and staff who were accustomed
to using e-mail software like Out-
look or Apple Mail," Girardi said.
"Because so many students were
already using Google, it seems
the transition has been easier for
them."
In a four-month period from
May to August, many University
faculty members and staff migrat-
ed to M+Google mail and calendar.
However, the University of Michi-
gan Health System, along with
other small research groups, is not
permitted to transition due to the
nature of healthcare regulations
and data restrictions. The Uni-
versity of Michigan-Google Apps
for Education Agreement doesn't
include liability protection, which
is a concern for UMHS and other
groups handling sensitive subject
matter. However, the groups will
still have access to Google tools
beyonde-mail.
Girardi said about 27,000 of
M+Google student users self-
migrated in the past six months,
about 51 percent of the student
population, noting that she
expects about 52,860 students to
self-migrate.
"As of this week about half
(of the University) has moved to
M+Google," Girardi said. "We are
sending out weekly reminders
to those who haven't moved yet,

advising them that they have until
the end of September to do so."
Engineering junior Shan
He said the self-migration was
appealing since he is already
familiar with Google's e-mail plat-
form.
"I migrated last semester
because I had a Gmail account
before I came here," he said. "It is
much more convenient because it
has Google calendar and Google
documents which are really use-
ful."
Even though Engineering
sophomore Andrew Pollack
didn't previously have a Google
account, he said he found the
transition to be smooth.
"Migration was a very easy
process," Pollack said. "I did it
about a week before school start-
ed, and it's a lot better because
Gmail keeps you logged in and it
shows the entire e-mail conversa-
tion."
However, theconcernsofsome
students who have had problems
making the change from IMAP
to Gmail are discouraging others
from making the switch.

announcement will be made.
The Related Companies is
one of the largest privately-
owned real estate firms in the
country, best known for devel-
oping Time Warner Center, a
skyscraper complex in NeW
York City.
Ross, 72, graduated from the
University with a bachelor's-
of business administration
in 1962. In 2004, he donated
$100 million to construct the
new Business School complex
in 2004, after which the Uni-
versity renamed the school in
his honor. As of March, his net
worth was $3.1 billion, accord-
ing to Forbes.
"I really have a lot of respect
for what's taught at Michigan,
the people here, and what it
stands for," Ross said.
Blau earned a bachelor's of
business administration from
the University in 1990 and has
also donated significant sums
to the Business School. Blau
Auditorium is named after him.
Peter Allen, moderator of the
event and a lecturer in the Busi-
ness School, said he connected
Ross and Blau after a lecture
in 1988. Allen explained that
after Ross spoke to his class, he
asked to meet with Allen's best
student, and that started the
partnership between Ross and
Blau.
"What came through loud
and clear was their emphasis
on passion and quality, both

on people and the product they
build," Allen said in an inter-
view after Thursday's event.
The majority of the questions
from students revolved around
job prospects, community val-
ues and personal reflection
for Ross and Blau. One student
said he had started three failed
businesses and asked the duo
about their greatest business
shortcoming.
"That story (the three failed
businesses) is worth more than
your GPA," Blau responded.
"Failure should be viewed as a
learning experience," he added.
Ross advised students to
think outside the traditional
market to find jobs, citing his
own company as an example.
"You have to have the atti-
tude that you don't want to be
where everybody else is," Ross
said. "We're always looking to
be doing things differently."
Ross also criticized the
Obama administration for new
regulations during the event,
saying the private sector could
"out wait" Obama and the 2012
election before investing.
Ross co-hosted a $2,500-per-
plate dinner for Republican
presidential nominee Mitt
Romney in January accord-
ing to Palm Beach Daily News.
However, Ross did not mention
Romney by name during the
event.
"From a political standpoint,
I think if we don't have a new
president,' we could have. a
worldwide recession, just the
way things are lined up," Ross
said.

In an interview after the
session, Ross said the only sur-
prising topic was the amount
of questions he received about
the . Miami Dolphins. He also
expressed uncertainty about
the fate of future entrepreneurs
as the country goes through a
"great change."
"It's unfortunate, you like
to think you're leaving it bet-
ter for the next generation, and
that might not be the case,"
Ross said.
Business senior Stan Dupuy
said he was impressed with
Ross and Blau's answers dur-
ing the event, but he wasn't
surprised Blau was being pro-
moted to CEO. Dupuy said two
years ago in a class visit, Ross
had indicated that Blau was
being groomed for the posi-
tion.
"We were pretty much told
that Jeff (Blau), having been
in the company for 20 years,
was really the next in line, and
that Steve was forming him to
be the next CEO of Related,"
Dupuy said.
Business freshman Abhi
Satya said he found Ross's
answers thorough and genu-
ine, and saw the stories of his
struggles with failure early in
his career as motivational.
"He truly inspired all the
students by telling us the story
of his failures and made him-
self seem like a real person,
like one of us, who came up
from being an eager student
to one of the most successful
businessmen of all time," Satya
said.


OBAMA
From Page 1A
said. "I never have. You didn't
elect me to tell you what you
wanted to hear. You elected me to
tell you the truth. And the truth
is, it will take more than a few
years for us to solve challenges
that have built up over decades."
He vowed, however, to solve
those challenges - to grow the
economy and restore the promise
of the middle class, end foreign
wars and energy dependence,
while improving all levels of edu-
cation.
"But know this, America, our
problems can be solved," Obama
said. "Our challenges can be met.
The path we offer may be harder,
but it leads to a better place. And
I'm asking you to choose that
future."
The plan Obama presented
in his speech included the cre-
ation of 1 million manufacturing
jobs by 2016, the reduction of net
oil imports by half by 2020 and
decreasing the growing rate col-
lege tuition in the next decade.
Obama spoke little of the youth
vote or on higher education, but
emphasized his experience in for-
eign policy and with the economy.
Obama called voting for him over
Republican presidential nomi-
nee Mitt Romney "the clearest
choice of any time in a genera-
tion," directing his most pointed
language to Romney's record of
outsourcing jobs.
"After a decade of decline,
this country created over half a

million manufacturing jobs in
the last two-and-a-half years,"
Obama said. "And now you have
a choice. We can give more tax
breaks to corporations that shift
jobs overseas or we can start
rewarding companies that open
new plants and train new workers
and create new jobs here in the
United States of America."
Obama continued to tout
his experience and his accom-
plishments in office, contrast-
ing himself with Romney. He
responded to Romney's charges
against him at the Republican
National Convention last week,
saying the Republicans failed to
offer solutions to the nation's
challenges.
"Now, our friends at the
Republican convention were
more than happy to talk about
everything they think is wrong
with America, but they didn't
have much to say about how
they'd make it right," Obama
said. "And that's because all
they have to offer is the same
prescription they've had for the
last thirty years."
Obama's focus on solutions
stemmed, in part, from his
desire to frame the election asa
choice between him and Rom-
ney rather than as a judgment
of his economic record, Politi-
cal Science Prof. Michael Trau-
gott said.
"He is vulnerable when the
campaign centers on the refer-
endum, and he's vulnerable if
the Republicans get the focus

omy," Traugott said. "Buthe's at

Resist "Temptation"
Don't chant "You Suck" at tomorrow's game
or anyone who's been to a Michigan football game in recent
years, there's a peculiar tradition in which the student section
chants "You Suck," to the tune of "Temptation." It's a student-
made tradition that many enjoy, but it's also a tradition that can make
our University appear petty. It's uncommon in the world of sports for
teams and fans to come together and agree to cut down on negativ-
ity and trash talk. It's all part of the game, right? It doesn't have to be.
And that's why Michigan students should be commended for starting
a movement aimed at banning "You suck" at the Air Force game on
Saturday.

Decisively undecided

returned to Ann Arbor a
. changed student. Yes, I'm a
year older, a year wiser and
all the other
philosophical
wisdom people
mutter about.
But most impor-
tantly, I came
back to campus
with a clear idea
of where I want
to be and what I SARAH
want to do. SKALUBA
For those of
you silently judg-
ing the fact that I'm an undeclared
junior, pardon me. But unfortunate-
ly, I was in the ranks of freshmen
that come through the University's
doors with a cookie-cutter plan and
a declared concentration.
The first year of college as an
undeclared student is a breeze. Peo-
ple ask what you're studying, you.
reply you're undecided. They quickly
take pity, "don't worry - you still
have so much time." Well, let me tell
you a secret I've learned since then:
They're wrong. Your collegiate years
do indeed fly by. My freshmen year
ended, then my sophomore year and
before I knew it, I was lost in the
"undecided, pre-med, possibly pre-
health" shuffle that all too many stu-
dents seem to find themselves in.
If there's any sort of wisdom I
can pass on to incoming freshmen
and those still-undecided sopho-
mores out there, it's this: Explore
all that our college has to offer you.
Whether it's that crazy first-year
seminar about aliens or Econom-
ics 101, move beyond your comfort
zone. How are you supposed to
know you love cultural anthropolo-
gy if you never take an intro course?
Or that your true passion lies in
public policy, but you've only taken
science courses?

Outside influence - whether
from family, friends or close men-
tors - places immense pressure on
decisions about concentrations and
future career paths. Decisions that
not only shape your entire under-
graduate experience, but affect
the opportunities you'll encoun-
ter years from now and the person
you'll ultimately become.
It's extremely important to not
only take a step back and think
about yourself and what truly
inspires you, but also to take into
consideration your own individual
goals and hopes. Too often, we
get lost in the hustle and bustle of
everyday campus life. Running to
classes, cramming for exams and
attempting to maintain some sort of
social life doesn't exactly leave time
for self-reflection.
Not to mention that future finan-
cial success, a well-respected career
and job security are important
factors constantly on our- minds.
Especially today, when our nation's
economy continues down a dan-
gerous path and the post-graduate
employment rate is worse than ever,
with 58 percent of recent graduates
either unemployed or underem-
ployed.
The economic environment we're
currently facing is most likely one of
the main reasons that more than half
of all undergraduates are declaring
concentrations in business, engi-
neering or nursing, according to U.S
Department of Education statistics.
There's nothing wrong with these
majors if it's truly what you feel pas-
sionate about and want to pursue.
But as young, determined Michigan
students with a variety of skills and
talents, we shouldn't feel restrict-
ed to a pre-professional major just
because it promises a specific career
upon graduation.
Why take advice from a complete

strajsger who's both undeclared
and already entering her third
year of college? It may seem like the
blind leading the blind. But honestly,
if there is one thing I wish I would
have known coming here two years
ago, it's this.
Discover what truly inspires you,
take courses that excite you and real-
ize you've only scratched the surface
of academia. If you don't take advan-
tage of all the opportunities thrust
your way an undergraduate student,
then when exactly do you plan on
discovering your passion and niche
in the world?
Ignore outside
influence and find
your passion.
Clearly, I took the roundabout
way of getting to where am I now,
but if it weren't for my misstep's
over the past two years, I'd still
be in the same undeclared, topsy-
turvy mess I found myself waiting
in a year ago. The eclectic courses
I took, my work at The Michigan
Daily and my recent experience
working on a U.S. Senate cam-
paign have helped shaped me as an
individual and have paved a road
towards a future I'm excited about
and willing to work for.
So here's to you guys - the help-
lessly lost, continuously wandering,
undeclared students of LSA. Don't
lose hope, ignore outside pressures
and never lose sight of finding what
truly inspires you.

On fourth down, regardless of the score,
the Michigan Marching Band plays "Tempta-
tion." But while the band chants "Oh, Yeah,"
Michigan students chant "You suck." A few
months ago, Michigan students took it upon
themselves to put an end to this tradition,
if at least for one game. With the Air Force
game fast-approaching, students created a
Facebook event urging other Michigan stu-
dents to chant "Defense, Defense" instead of
"You Suck" during the song. More than 2,100
people have joined the effort.
This is a student initiative. And while reac-
tions may vary, it'sgreat to see students striving
to be more respectful at football games - espe-
cially to those who serve in our country's armed
forces. It's important to show other universities
and sports fans that Michigan students have
respect for those risking their safety for our
nation's. This student objective has potential to
promote respect at non-sporting events as well.
By committing to this movement, students are
proving they can take initiative and not simply
react to an administrative decree.
University administration has been threat-

ening to force the band to stop playing "Temp-
tation," but actions should not only be altered as
a result of threats. As students of the Universi-
ty, we should realize that the "You suck" chant
can be perceived as - and usually is - imma-
ture by our respected alumni base. After all, as
college students, we should be above juvenile
language, despite a competitive setting. By par-
ticipating in the chant, we're encouraging neg-
ativity to younger generations, as well as other
schools the Wolverines face.
As students of a University with leading
reputations in a multitude ofstudies, we should
also strive to be leaders in promoting respect.
This movement is a first step toward eliminat-
ing negativity. In this case, it is a matter of lead-
ing by example. As a leader in collegiate sports,
we need to act the part. On Saturday, by not
chanting "You-suck," we can change aless than
impressive tradition.
Refraining from the "You suck" chant at the
Air Force game this weekend is a simple, but
necessary, way to show our appreciation for
servicemen and women. Everyone should unite
and participate in this effort to show respect.

When MariaIbarra was a senior in
high school, she had only one school
in mind for college -the University
of Michigan. But when she told a
counselor that she lacked legal citi-
zenship status, she was devastated to
learn that her dream was most likely
impossible. Maria was born in Mex-
ico and came to Detroit with her
parents when she was nine years
old. Maria is undocumented. And as
a result, she was ineligible to obtain
in-state tuition status from the Uni-
versity, nor could she be supported
by federal financial aid. That harsh
financial reality keptAnn Arbor just
out of Maria's reach.
Maria instead attended the Uni-
versity of Detroit Mercy, where last
year she graduated as Valedicto-
rian. Because of the University of
Michigan's regressive tuition poli-
cies, Maria was denied access to her
dream school, and we were denied
Maria's talent and intelligence.
The University ties eligibility for
in-state tuition to legal residency,
and thus excludes the thousands
of undocumented students who
attend Michigan primary and sec-
ondary schools. These students,
often from' the lower rungs of the
state's economic ladder, face pro-
hibitively high tuition rates with
fewer means - such as financial aid
programs - to overcome them. The
University is in effect hindering a
specific class of young Michigan-
ders with institutional barriers to
educational access.
The rationale for tiered tuition at
public universities istwofold. First, it
supposes the notion that those who

have paid into the university sys-
tem through taxes deserve a lower
rate. Contrary to persistent anti-
immigration myths, undocumented
immigrants contribute substantially
to state and federal coffers. They pay
sales and property taxes and at least
half, according to the non-partisan
-Institute for Taxation and Economic
Policy, pay income taxes through an
IRS Individual Taxpayer Identifica-
tion Number.
Second, public higher education
is often deemed an investment in
those young people most likely to
stay and contribute to the state. In
the case of undocumented students,
their personal and civic ties reside
squarely in Michigan, and almost
all, including Maria, count more
years in this state than many of
their documented counterparts. It's
counter to the University's mission
to "serve the people of Michigan"
and detrimental to the state's eco-
nomic future to effectively shut its
doors to an entire group of bright,
qualified Michigan students.
Critics of tuition equality for
undocumented students cry foul
over fairness, claiming that it's
a disservice to citizens and legal
immigrants to "reward" those
without legal status. The reality is
that the students in question ille-
gally crossed borders or overstayed
their visas.as young children at their
parents' behest, or were themselves
victimized by an often perverse
immigration bureaucracy. The con-
sequence of condemning entire gen-
erations of young people is economic
stupidity and abject moral failure on

a societal scale. -
It's worth remembering that
before this issue entered the ugly
realm of partisan debate, it was
addressed with common sense and
decency. Currently, 12 states have
laws that grant undocumented stu-
dentsequalconsiderationforin-state
tuition, includingKansas, Texas and
Utah - not exactly bleeding-heart
liberal legislatures.
The University has the constitu-
tional authorityto act autonomous-
ly in this regard, and it has a moral
obligation to do so. Access to edu-
cation is perhaps the defining issue
of contemporary civil rights in this
country. The Coalition for Tuition
Equality, a collection of more than
a dozen student organizations, is
committed to making sure that
the University makes good on its
responsibility to all students in
Michigan and finds its way to the
right side of history.
As representatives of the state's
flagship of higher education, it's the
duty of all students, faculty mem-
bers and administrators to speak
out against discrimination and
in favor of access and justice for
young Michiganders. Once Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman and the
University's regents hear our voices
and those of the thousands of young
people fenced out from the Michi-
gan Difference, a failure to act on
tuition equality would besmirch
with bitter hypocrisy our place
among the leaders and best.

Ruckus's return to the The Ark
as the group kicks off its "Eter-
nity of Dimming" tour, promot-
ing the upcoming 2013 release
of the highly anticipated third
full-length album that singer-
songwriter for the band Mat-
thew Milia described as "the
culmination of a trilogy that
began with The Orion Songbook
and Deadmalls & Nightfalls,"
their previous albums. ,
Frontier Ruckus started in
2002 when two Bloomfield
Hills, Mich. high school stu-
dents, Milia and banjoist for the
group David W. Jones, began
working together. Originally
the duo had a slight musical
rivalry, but it soon grew into
friends and collaborators that
brought a strong energy to the
early days of Frontier Ruckus,
explained Milia, which never
left. After Jones, a year Milia's
senior, began studying at the
University, Milia would drive
up to practice with him in his
dorm room.
"U of M was really our first

college experience as a band
and our first foray into some
tenuous professionalism," Milia
said. "We played at Amer's in
the Union and out in the diag;
back then we dreamed of play-
ing at the Blind Fig or The Ark."
While Miliastudied at Michi-
gan State University, "Frontier
Ruckus" grew in size and musi-
cal maturity as the band contin-
ued to develop its repertoire and
reputation, explained Milia.
The Band currently consists of
two other members Ryan Etz-
corn and Zachary Nichols, both
of whom Milia met in East Lan-
sing.
In 2008, the group's first full-
length album, The Orion Song-
book, not only represented a sort
of artistic thesis for the group
- as Milia explained - but also
garnered wide and abundant
praise from critics. Allmusic
reviewer Chris Berggren wrote,
"The Orion Songbook is about as
good a debut as a band can hope
for," while Aaron Shaul, a music

critic for Detroit's MetroTimes,
wrote, "this debut establishes
the group as already one of the
very best sounds to come out of
Michigan this entire decade."
2010 sophomore album,
Deadmalls & Nightfalls, received
similar praise from an even
wider audience. After nearly
two years of touring, the band is
getting ready to release its third
album, a double CD with 20
songs to be released in January.
Milia explained that whereas
The Orion Songbook was poetic
with broad strokes and Dark-
malls & Nightfalls represented
a step towards more fixity and
itemization, Eternity of Dim-
ming is, from a writing perspec-
tive, the most hyperbolically
specific.
"I couldn't be more proud
of the record," Milia said. "In
terms of personal mythology
and lyricism, it's a new height
for me. Sifting through the
abundance of tangential mem-
ories, dense short stories and

scenes, and then distilling them
into a mammoth work like this
is cathartic."
Though the record has
many imagistic motifs, Milia
explained that one of the most
pervasive is the catalog of '90s
merchandise written into many
of the songs.
"The clunky, heavy metaphor
of '90s technology, like a copy
machine or one of those huge
computer monitors, just sitting
there with all its obsolescence,"
Milia said. "My childhood was
the '90s and I still have all these
useless things from that splen-
did time. All those weighty
objects are now anchors of a
dead era, so it's a very bitter-
sweet nostalgia."
But Milia's lyricism is not
the only aspect of Frontier
Ruckus that brings the nostal-
gic requiem to the record. Milia
explained that every member
of the band brought something
much more intense and diverse.
"Sonically, it's a different
vibe on this record," Milia said,
"It's got a lot of jangly electric
guitar - i la The Birds or Big
Star - along with keyboarding
from the '80s and '90s. Pulsat-
ing and unpredictable percus-
sion along with organs give the
record a musicality we worked
really hard on."
Rather- than describing the
album's sound as distinct from
previous works, Milia explained
that all the elements that came
to define Frontier Ruckus are
still present in the record, only
expanded upon as they main-
tain a connection to their roots.
That essential fixity in the
music gives the Michigan shows
a shared relatability, which
Milia explained, makes them
the best of the tour.
"There is a specificity toour
music, since it is rooted in a
locality and mythologization of
'home,' which purveys through
the whole Michigan landscape,"
Milia said.

Sophomore Carl Ward breaks into the clear against Air Force in Michigan's 24-7 victory at Michigan Statium on Sept. 29, 1964.
Archives: Michigan runs past Air Force in'64

By BILL BULLARD
Daily Sports Editor
On Sept. 29, 1964, the Michi-
gan football team opened its sea-
son at Michigan Stadium against
Air Force.'
It was the Wolverines' first
and only meeting with the Fal-
cons until this Saturday, when
the two teams face off again at
the Big House.
This is the Daily's game story
from Michigan's 24-7 victory on
that day in 1964:
Bump Elliott's Wolverines
used a combined arsenal of rush-
ing and passing yesterday to
overpower a spunky Air Force
squad which could move only
through the air in the season
opener for Michigan here yester-
day. The score was 24-7.
Quarterback Bob Timberlake
set the tone for the game as he
guided the Wolverines into the
end zone the first time they got
their hands on the ball. He also
engineered two 80-yard drives
culminating in touchdowns dur-
ing the second and third quar-
ters.
And to top off a very successful
afternoon for the senior signal-
caller who had been a doubtful
starter last week, Timberlake
booted a field goal from the Fal-
con 16-yard line just before the
half ended to give the Wolverines
a 17-7 halftime margin.
Rival Coach Ben Martin
whose team had defeated Wash-

ington 3-2 last Saturday, praised
the Wolverines afterwards for
posing a dangerous double-
threat. "The Wolverines have a
quarterback who can throw the
ball," he observed. "But when he
couldn't get rid of it, he kept the
ball and still gained yardage by
running."
At the same time, he lamented
the Air Force failure to win by a
massive air attack.
"We intended to pass quite a
bit, although not as much as we
actually did. We have players
who can throw and catch and we
expected that Michigan's defense
against passing would be weaker
than its running defense."
Complete 15 of 21
The Air Force completed 15 of
21 passes in the first half but only
eight of 19 in the second half as
the Michigan secondary tight-
ened up somewhat.
Michigan rolled up 311 yards
rushing and 91 yards passing.
Coach Bump Elliot commented
that he thought the whole team
played well for the first game of
the season.
"I was especially pleased
with the way our sophomores
came through," he added. Elliott
started sophs Carl Ward at right
halfback and Jim Detwiler at left
halfback. Detwiler was subbing
for junior John Rowser, out of
action with a leg injury.
Ward and Detwiler picked up
51 and 72 yards rushing, respec-
tively. But the team's rushing
leaders were Timberlake with

80 yards and senior fullback
Mel Anthony with 79 yards on
the ground. Sophomore fullback
Dave Fisher made it into the
game in the fourth quarter and
picked up 28 yards on six carries.
Elliott said, "I think the game
was in doubtuntil the third quar-
ter, when Timberlake on a third
down pass play ran to get the first
down by a yard."
The Wolverines had taken
over on their own 20-yard line
after Bart Holaday was wide
on a field goal from the Michi-
gan 16-yard line. The Wolverine
offense moved to the 45-yard line
before it seemingly stalled. But
on a third down and 30 yards to
go situation, Timberlake couldn't
find a receiver open and ran up
the middle of the field to the Air
Force 24-yard line, just making
the first downby a yard.
Anthony Gets First
Three plays later Anthony
gained a first down on the 14-yard
line on a fourth down and one
yard to go situation. Anthony
picked up four more yards on the
next play. Detwiler then started
to sweep around right end, cut
inside the end, and when hit by
opposing tacklers about the four-
yard line simply bulled his way
into the end zone.
This score and Timberlake's
conversion put Michigan on top
24-7. Both teams threatened
in the final quarter but neither
scored.
Michigan moved in for the
first score of the season after

the third play of the game when
Falcon halfback Paul Wargo
fumbled and senior left tackle
Arnie Simkus recovered on the
Air Force 35-yard line. It took the
Wolverines eight plays to chalk
up the seven points.
Second Touchdown.
Michigan's middle touchdown
came after a close call on defense.
Junior linebacker Tom Cecchini
had temporarily halted a Falcon
drive by recovering Wargo's fum-
ble on the Michigan 15-yard line.
But two plays later Timber-
lake passed to Henderson at the
28-yard line and Henderson, try-
ing to outflank a Falcon defender
and escape down the left side-
lines, fumbled the ball. It was
recovered by Lloyd Duncan on
the 15-yard line and the Falcons
were once again in a threatening
position.
Fullback Steve Amdor tried
to carry the ball through right
guard on the first play but was
nailed at the line of scrimmage
by junior linebacker Chuck Deh-
lin. On the next play, quarterback
Tim Murphy lofted a pass to
end Bill Landes but sophomore
defensive halfback Rich Volk
leaped in front of Landes to catch
the ball for a touchback.
Eight Plays
Michigan started from the
20-yard line and charged down
the 80 yards in only eight plays
for the touchdown. The big plays
of the series were a 34-yard run
around left end by Ward who had
taken Timberlake's pitchout and

a 25-yard Timberlake to Steve
Smith pass play. Anthony scored
from five yards out on the second
play of the second quarter.
Murphy completed four
passes and a pass inference pen-
alty put the bal on the Michigan
seven-yard line. But the Falcon
attack bogged down and on the
fourth down situation, Murphy
was ready to hold the ball for
Holaday's field goal attempt. But
Murphy picked up the ball, rolled
to his right and hit halfback Dick
Czarnota in the end zone for the
touchdown.
Detwiler Runback
Air Force kicked off the Michi-
gan and Detwiler ran it out of the
end zone to the 35-yard line of
the Wolverines. Timberlake led
the Wolverines down the field
with passes of 16 and ten yards
to junior end Craig Kirby and
his own 19-yard run. Then on
the six-yard line of the Falcons,
a personal foul was called on
Michigan and the attack stalled.
Timberlake attempted a field
goal but it was blocked by Amdor.
The Michigan signal-caller fell
on the ball at the 45-yard line but
got another chance to go for the
three-pointer when an offsides
penalty was called on Air Force.
This time Timberlake's attempt
was wide but the Falcons were
offside again.
The third time Timberlake
didn't miss. He split the uprights
from the 16-yard line, putting the
Wolverines on top, 17-7, at half-
time.

VOLLEYBALL
'M' heads to
Wisconsin
for Classic
By GREG GARNO
Daily SportsaEditor
The Michigan volleyball team's
season hasn't been considered
successful just because it has gone
undefeated while playing with
seven freshmen despite missing its
lone four-year player.
But rather Michigan has been
successful because the 23rd-
ranked Wolverines have gone 7-0
without using thesame starting
lineup twice.
"What it really says to me is that
we have a lot of depth," said Mich-
igan coach Mark Rosen about his
team's success. "We have a lot of
players that can fill different roles
and it'sbeen an interesting experi-
ence this year."
Certainly, Michigan's lineup
hasn't moved around by choice
this year, but it has managed to
make the mostofevery game. This
weekend, the Wolverines will take
their lineup to the Golden Eagle
Classic in Milwaukee, Wisc. for a
four-game tournament.
On Friday, the Wolverines take
on Wake Forest and Marquette -
a pair of teams Michigan carries
a 6-0 combined all-time record
against. The Wolverines con-
clude the tournament on Saturday
against first-time opponent East-
ern Illinois and No. 25 Northern
Iowa.
Michigan will miss senior right-
side hitter Claire McElheny, who
was absent from last weekend's
home tournamentwith anunspec-
ified injury. One of last year's lead-
ers in kills, McElheny'n absence
has forced junior outside hitter
Molly Toon to make the switch to
right-side hitter along with fresh-
man outside hitter Ally Davis.
Early-season games present
another challenge for Michigan;
which has limited time to prepare
for the competition. But the head
coach has14years of experience to
compensate for that.
"I think Marquette really tends
to run a very fast style of volley-
ball," Rosen said. "Their coach
likes to go really quick with his
tempo, so that puts some pressure
onus."
The Wolverines will counter
this tempo with the strong play of
junior outside hitter Lexi Erwin,
who is second in the Big Ten in
kills per set with 4.42. After she
was subbed out in Saturday's game
against Arkansas, Michigan strug-
gled to hold a lead. The Wolverines
take on a ranked team for the first
time this season in NorthernIowa.
The Panthers (4-2) will look to
senior outside hitter Amy Braun,
averaging 3.16 kills per set this
year, to overcome Michigan junior
middle blocker Jennifer Cross.
"Northern Iowa is a great vol-
leyball program," Rosen said.
"They've had a really strong tra-
dition and their kids know how
to play the game very well. They

don't make alot of errors and they
know how to putpressure onyou."
Michigan will also use Toon,
who is quietly surging to the top
of Mighigan's leaderboards. Toon
- named to the adidas/Michigan
Challenge first team on Saturday
- looks to carry the success from
her 12 kill performance against
Arkansas. After tallying 21 total
blocks last year, the junior already
has11 in her new role.
Expect sophomore setter Lexi
Dannemiller to also be a key factor,
after beingnamed the tournament
MVP on Saturday. Dannemiller
averages more than 11 assists per
set and has played in all 26 of the
Wolverines' sets.
Michigan's greatest advan-
tage may be in their chance to
scout opponents live, though. The
opportunity allows the Wolver-
ines to learn more about a team
they havey't played since 1992.
"We try and have them watch
the game from their position,"
Rosen said. "Who are you going
to be up against and what do you
have to do to be successful. I think
by the time we play them our play-
ers will have a lot of insight."

Michigan looks to- rebound against Air Force

This week, the pregame discus-
sion was again about unmatched
recrtsiting classes. The dialogue
touched on size disparities and
about game-

said Air Force
coach Troy Calhoun. "They're
pretty darn big.
"And they're very, very good.
They're gonna have a bunch of guys
out there that had a bunch of stars
after their name when they were in
high school."
Sounds familiar, and for No. 19
Michigan, its task this week should
be familiar: Prove it can dominate
Air Force just as Alabama dominat-
ed Michigan. This week, the gap in
talent and athleticism is arguably
larger, but that might not show on
the field.
If Alabama wins through the
sheer force of its talent, Air Force
wins despite its lack of talent. The
Falcons move, they pitch, they pull
and block downfield. They fake,
they counter and they option, and
when your head starts spinning,
they throw play-action passes over
it.
Earlier this week, -senior defen-
sive end Craig Roh likened the Air
Force triple-option attack to "mass
chaos".
"There's Army in there, there's
Navy in there," said Michigan
coach Brady Hoke, who referred to
the other service academies' offen-
sive systems. "The midline series,
the veer series, but then there's also
some pro-style offense. They give
you a lot of looks, a lot of different
formations. There's a lot of window
dressing that goes along with it."
Calhoun said this year's
iteration of the triple-option

relies more heavily than in years
past on zone reads and toss sweeps
with a good amount of play action
passing. The Falcons are built to
feast on a Michigan defense that
looked unsure and undisciplined
last Saturday.
"If your eyes aren't where they
need to be, if you're not physical at
the line of scrimmage,you're going
to have problems," Hoke said.
Against Idaho Statelast week,
Air Force rushed for 484 yards,
an average of 8.3 per attempt, and
scored an other-worldly seven
touchdowns on the ground.-
Michigandid not face a triple-
option offense last year, and they
won't face another aside from the
Falcons in 2012. Defenses, even
strong ones, that are unfamiliar
with the Air Force offense tend to
struggle. The Falcons gained more
than 400 yards of total offense
against its three toughest oppo-
nents last year - Notre Dame, TCU
and Boise State - including 565
yards against the Irish.
Compare that to teams accus-
tomed to defending the triple
option, Army and Navy, both of
which held Air Force to less than
400 yards. The Falcons gained
more than 250 more yards against
Notre Dame than they did facing
the Midshipmen.
"As a coach I'll be dead honest
with you," said defensive coordi-
nator Greg Mattison. "I don't care
who you're playing, getting 500
yards is a lot of yards."
For a run-heavy team, Air Force
does not chew up much clock.
Opposing teams averaged slightly
more time of possession in 2011
than the Falcons. And opposing
offenses last year averaged more
plays per game (68) than Michi-
gan averaged last year (66).
Yet when Air Force establishes
the run (and doesn't score on a
quick strike), the wait between a
punt and the next possession can
be excruciating.
Michigan must counter with
efficiency, something which offen-
sive coordinator Al Borges admit-
ted was lacking against Alabama.
Senior quarterback Denard Rob-
inson completed less than half of
his passes (11-for 26) and Michigan
converted just three third downs

outof12. The way to exploit the Fal-
cons' defense, though, is through
the air. Idaho State completed 42
of 53 passing attempts for365 yards
and two touchdowns.
Michigan performs best when
Robinson ignites the offense with
his legs. After the loss to Alabama,
Borges said he pulled Robinson
aside and told him, "I don't want
you to think you lost the game,
although there'll be people who
want to make you believe that."
Borges continued: "We didn't
run the ball."
The return of redshirt junior
running back Fitzgerald Toussaint
from suspension helps, but bynow,
Robinson is a known commodity.
To free up running lanes, Robin-
son will have to pass.

Though many of his players are

At long last, the Michigan football team is back home. The Wol-
verines open their 2012 home schedule Saturday against Air
Force, hoping to rebound from a poor showing in the Cowboys
Classic against Alabama. Redshirt junior running back Fitzgerald
Toussaint is back, and expected to start, so Michigan's running
game might actually get going against the Falcons.

Air Force senior quarterback
Connor Dietz was part of a back-
field corps that rushed for a nation-
high 484 yards last weekend. Dietz
finally slowed down this week, just
long enough to sit down for a press
conference in Colorado Springs,
Colo.
This transcript, courtesy of a Air
Force Athletic Department video,
touches on Dietz's game, his roots
in Ohio State country and more:
Question: Growing up in Colum-
bus, Ohio, I bet you grew up a big
Michigan fan.
Connor Dietz: Not at all. But I
was never really into the whole
Ohio State-Michigan rivalry. I was
a college football fan, and obviously
it was Ohio State growing up, but
once I came here it's pretty much all
Air Force. I don't really see how you
can be a fan of someone else when
you're playing for another team.
Q: Would you say that your
hatred for Michigan is a little more
close to home than other players on
the team?
CD: I guess you could say so
because of my roots, but I've never
really despised them. I've got acou-
ple of guys who played at my high
school that play up there (redshirt
freshman Keith Heitzman). They're
obviously a great college football
team. It's going to be a good chal-
lenge, but as a competitor this is
what you want, and as ateam this is
what we're looking forward to.
Q: In addition to what you do
offensively, how much can the pace
of what you do help you in a game
like this?

CD: Ourtempo, our.conditioning,
we're going to have to use every-
thing to our advantage that we can.
Being aware on offense of where
we're going, when we're going
there. Trying to keep the tempo up
is going to playa crucial part, that's
for sure.
It's not one of those games where
it's going to be a first-quarter game
or a second-quarter game. We're
looking to play four quarters, and
that's what we think it's going to be.
Q: Michigan has big-play ability.
Is this the kind of game where you
try to hang with them, and the lon-
ger you hang with them the better
chance you have of winning?
CD: Any time you're in a big
game, you want to come down in
the fourth quarter and have it be a
one-possession game. From there,
anything can happen on any given
Saturday. We're going to play our
game, be us. Michigan hasn't seen
us, we haven't seen them. We're
gonna go out, be the best we can be
for three quarters, and then in the
fourth quarter see where we are.
Q: How would you assess your
play last Saturday (in Air Force's
49-21victory over Idaho St.)?
CD: I played OK. It's nice to come
out the first home game and get the
nerves out and get the first win out
of the way, but I didn't playtoo well.
I could have been a little smarter
with some of my throws. In a game
like this, coming up, some of those
throws we're goingto have to hit for
home runs instead of 30-yard gains.
Some of my rushes, I could have
ran a little harder, maybe broken

one or two more tackles. ... There's
a lot of things when you come back
in on Monday and turn the film
on. It's a whole new game; it's like
you didn't even play the last game,
you're watching something brand
new.
Q: When you look at the sched-
ule, people say, 'Oh, this is Michi-
gan.' Is it hard to just tell yourself
this is asnormal game?
CD: It's kind of hard. Obviously,
we've all been looking at this game
since last January - me especially,
being from the Midwest. It comes
down to: It is another game. They
were talking to us about the crowd
and everything, but they play every
home game there in that kind of
atmosphere, so I think we can go
in and play one game there. A lot of

guys on this team have had expe-
rience going into big-time games
like this - Oklahoma, Notre Dame
- so it is another game and we can
only control what we can control.
There's no use worrying about
other things.
Q: Is it dangerous to face a team
like Michigan when they're com-
ing off a game they feel a little bit
embarrassed about?
CD: I think facing a team like
Michigan is dangerous no matter
how they feel or whatever game
they came off of.
"They have playmakers on both
sides of the ball, more than one,
obviously. There's not really a good
time or bad time to catch them;
every time you playa team like that
it's going to be a four-quarter grind

and you've got to come to play with-
your hard-hat on.
Q: Are you goingto have to match
Denard Robinson step for step for
your team to have a chance this
weekend?
CD: (laughs) Nah. I never really
understood why people compared
quarterbacks ... because you never
play againsteach other, so I never
understood why it's a quarterback
versus a quarterback thing. I think
it's Air Force offense versus Michi-
gan defense.
"And while Denard Robinson is
a huge part of Michigan's offense,
it's Michigan's offense against Air
Force's defense. So I'm not going to
try and focus on anything like that,
I'm going to try to focus on my job
with our offense.

Ohio is so good at football.

Sure, there's population -
it's the seventh-largest state
in the country by that mea-
sure. But New York, Illinois
and Pennsylvania all have
bigger populations, and none
match Ohio's football prow-
ess (though Pennsylvania
nearly does). Michigan and
North Carolina come close to
Ohio's population figure, but
they don't hold a candle to
the quality of Ohio's football
either. When you talk to high
school coaches - the ones
who see the interest more

acutely than anyone else,
who feel the pressure more
strongly than anyone else -
you find that even they don't
have a firm answer.
The only possible expla-
naiton is passion.

a visceral, almost indefinable

In some ways, the history
of Michigan football is the
history of an Ohio foundation.
That foundation includes two
of three Heisman winners,
two of the previous four head
coaches - including the most
iconic - and some of the best
players in Wolverine history.
That foundation includes
Hoke, and his focus on Ohio
- a focus that has yielded
results unmatched in recent
years. And there's no reason
to believe the run in Ohio
won't continue.

Williams from Cincinnati
Sycamore - saw playing
time in Michigan's season
opener against Alabama last
Saturday.
For the class of2013, Hoke
has already secured nine
more Ohioans, including six
four-star players.
Simply put, no previous
Michigan coach - at least
recently - has done better
in Ohio than Hoke has so far.
In his two full classes,
Hoke has landed 18 players
from the state, with a star
average of 3.7 according to
Rivals. By comparison, Rich
Rodriguez signed 14 Ohio-
ans in his two full classes
as Michigan head coach,
with a star average of 3.1.
And in Lloyd Carr's final six
full recruiting classes from
2002-07, the Wolverines
signed just 12 players from
Ohio, albeit. with a 3.6 star
average.
"I think that it's a com-
bination of Michigan being
a high-profile school in the
Midwest and Brady Hoke
putting a focal point on the
state of Ohio," said Rivals.,
com Midwest Analyst Josh
Helmoldt. "It's come togeth-
er and allowed them to real-
ly make a strong dent in the
top talent for that state."
Hoke's efforts are espe-

cially notable when com-
pared to his predecessor's.
As the numbers indicate,
Rodriguez recruited Ohio
strongly. But he focused just
as much on Florida, where
his staff had ties and where
he had recruited in the past.
Rodriguez emphasized
Florida as much as Hoke's
staff emphasizes the Mid-
west.
The current staff has
four assistants specifically
assigned to Ohio. Smith and
defensive coordinator Greg
Mattison focus on the major
hotbeds - the southwest
section around Cincinnati
and Dayton and the north-
east section around Cleve-
land, respectively. Offensive
coordinator Al Borges and
defensive line coach Jerry
Montgomery also help out.
Rodriguez, meanwhile,
had four coaches assigned
to Florida. While that state
produces even more talent
than Ohio, the competi-
tion is greater, with three
in-state powers - Florida,
Florida State and Miami -
and the rest of the South also
making a concerted effort to
recruit there.
It was like Rodriguez
was searching for a fountain
of youth in Florida. Hoke,
meanwhile, has already
begun mining the Potosi
that sits next door.
"You're just kind of get-
ting who you can, when you
can (in Florida)," Helmholdt
said. "I think when you're
looking at building a class,

don Moore, for example, all
said that they didn't grow
up rooting strongly for Ohio
State.
Hoke was helped, too, in
the 2012 class by the tattoo/
memorabilia scandal that hit
Columbus and eventually
forced the resignation of for-
mer coach Jim Tressel. The
uncertainty surrounding the
Ohio State program caused
several recruits to re-think
their plans.
Kalis and Strobel, for
example, both were Ohio
State fans, and they have said
they likely never would've
considered Michigan were it
not for the doubts that arose
concerning the Buckeyes.
Kalisein fact, was initially
committed to the Buckeyes.
But each decided to -look at
the Wolverines in the wake
of Ohio State's issues.
That pair and the other
Ohio recruits have been sold
on Michigan because of the
way that Hoke and his staff
operate.
"Really down to earth,"
said Sycamore High School
coach Scott Dattilo, who
coached Williams. "That's
the one thing about Coach
Hoke that jumped out. I've
known Coach Smith for
a while, very easy to talk
to him, but Coach Hoke's
just a down-to-earth guy. I
can see why kids would be
drawn to him. Doesn't come
off as holier-than-thou head
coach.
"Just one of the guys that
comes in and talks football,
and I think that's an appeal-

ing trait."
The coaching staff,
including Mattison - who
has a reputation for being
one of the best recruit-
ers in all of college football
- knows Ohio well, and it
doesn't put on any pretens-
es when it recruits there.
Genuineness is what most
recruits point to when asked
about the Michigan coaches,
accordingto Helmholdt.
Dymonte Thomas, a
safety/running back from
Marlington High School in
Alliance who is committed
to Michigan for 2013, even
said that Mattison is "pretty
much like another dad for
me."
It's that comfort level that
Ohio recruits have found
with Hoke and company
that has spurred the staff's
recent recruiting successes.

Like Thomas, Pickering-
ton North High School tight
end Jake Butt, another 2013
commit, said he thought
he'd "never go" to Michigan
before Hoke's staff began
recruiting him.
'"After visiting for the
Ohio State game, the Michi-
gan-Notre Dame game, get-
ting to see games like that,
it really just got my heart
into Michigan," Butt said..
"You know what? It wasn't
even hard at all (to pick Ohio
State's biggest rival)."

From a defender's perspective,,
Air Force's triple-option rushing
attack looks like a mess. The offen-
sive linemen are absurdly mobile,
senior quarterback Connor Dietz
has speed and senior running back
Cody Getz is faster.
'On Tuesday, senior defensive
end Craig Roh described the triple
option as "mass chaos."
But in reality, the triple option is
very calculated and requires a ton
of discipline to deploy successfully.
Needless to say, the Falcons are
disciplined, and they know how to
exploit defenses that aren't.
On every rushing play, Dietz
has the option of handing off to his
fullback, keeping the ball himself
or pitching it to his tailback. To
defend against that multi-pronged
attack, Michigan's defenders need
to stick to their keys instead of
flocking to the ball on every play.

toERIN KIRKLAND/Daily
Michigan coach Brady Hoke has a stiff test waiting in week two.

The Wolverines struggled
mightily against Alabama last Sat-
urday, and now they'll have to gear
up for an offense that most players
have little experience defending
against. Consider the triple option
an equalizer of sorts for an Air
Force squad that lacks the talent
and athleticism Michigan will see
in the conference season.
Edge: Air Force
Air Force pass offense vs. Michi-
gan pass defense
If the triple option rushing
attack isn't mind-boggling enough
in itself, consider that Dietz also
has the option to pass the ball.
Forgot about that, didn't you?
Air Force doesn't throw the
ball much. Last Saturday, the Fal-
cons rushed the ball 58 times and

attempted only 11 passes.
But each tlime Dietz throws the
ball he has the defensive coverage
on its heels, which creates space
for the ensuing running plays. And
maybe after running the ball eight
to 10 plays in a row, he'll shock you
with the deep ball, which he isn't
afraid to throw.
Dietz threw for 142 yards on just
eight completions against Idaho
State last week.
Still, Air Force's receivers aren't
the most physical, and Michigan's
secondary should do a solid job
sticking with them, even with cor-
nerback Blake' Countess's season-
ending ACL tear against Alabama.

Eighty-five years after Bennie
Oosterbaan graduated from Michi-
gan as a five-time All-American,
his No. 47 jersey is finally back on
the field.
Oosterbaan, a nine-time Michi-
gan letterman in football, basket-
ball and baseball from 1924-28,
earned All-American distinction
five times - three times asa defen-
sive end and wide receiver, and
twice as a forward on the hard-
wood. His No. 47 was the first"
number retired by the Michigan
'football team, and on Saturday.it'll
be the first one reinstated.
This season, the Wolverines will
honor Oosterbaan, former Presi-

dent Gerald Ford (No. 48), Ron
Kramer (No. 87) and the Wistert
brothers (No. 11) - Francis, Albert
and Alvin - by returning their
former jersey numbers to the field
with a patch designating them as
'Michigan Football Legend' jer-
seys. On Saturday, one Michigan
player will trot out of the tunnel
with a new number - No. 47.
Who that player will be, though,
is still a mystery.
"I kind of put a pool of names
together," said Michigan coach
Brady Hoke. "The qualities that we
would look for and the character
that we would look for."
Does he know which player it'll
be?
"I think I know what we're going
to do," Hoke said.

Hoke will present the number to
a deserving player, but they'll have
to accept the attention that comes
with representing a legend like
Oosterbaan.
"That's up to them," Hoke said.
"Believe me, I'm not going to force
it on anybody, but we're going to
have a conversation about it and
about what this means and what an
honor it is."
Immediately following his
graduation in 1928, Oosterbaan
joined on as an assistant coach for
the Michigan football and men's
basketball teams. He became head
basketball coach in1948 and served
in that capacity for nine seasons.
In 1948 he also became head
football coach. In 11.seasons, he
compiled a 63-33-4 record. Michi-

gan won three Big Ten champi-
onships under Oosterbaan, the
national title in 1948 and the 1951
Rose Bowl.
"I think there's a lot to say about
Bennie's legacy and his perfor-
mance and his production, his
character and integrity that he
brought to Michigan," Hoke said,
adding that he never met Ooster-
baan before his death in 1990.
Hoke said Michigan will be edu-
cated on Oosterbaan's impact at
Michigan prior to the home opener
against Air Force on Saturday.
In an interview with Michigan
historian Greg Dooley, Ooster-
baan's godson Ben McCready -
named after Oosterbaan - said the
-legend's family "loved and support-
ed" the idea.

McCready and eight members
of Oosterbaan's family will be
featured in an on-field ceremony
before the game on Saturday.
"I think Bennie would be
thrilled that his number was going'
to be back on the field, as it was
for the very first game ever played
in Michigan Stadium," McCready
said. "I also think he might be a bit
embarrassed by all the fuss but as
long as it made people happy he'd
be fine with it."
When asked if he had any
preference to who wears No. 47,
McCready pinpointed fifth-year
senior safety Jordan Kovacs.
"But I don't have any say in that
decision," McCready said. "I trust
the coaches to pick the right play-
er."

Michigan football's history
with the state of Ohio and
the resurgence under .Hoke
By: Ben Estes, Daily Sports Editor

CINCINNATI - It's just
past dawn on a day in early
August here, though this
scene could befound anywhere in
this state: other big cities such as
Columbus or Cleveland, smaller sub-
urbs such as Pickerington or Lake-
wood, quainter towns like Findlay.
A group of 16- and 17-year-olds
find themselves trudging across a
vast grass field. The sun is beginning
to peek through the clouds, and it is
at the same time glorious and fore-
boding. Glorious, because the rays
soften the gloominess of the long,
arduous day set before these teen-
agers; foreboding, because the rays
also promise misery once morn-
ing recedes into afternoon and the
August heat begins to stifle them
once again.

For young men to be awake this
early on a late summer morning -
the last days of freedom before the
school year seizes their lives for nine
more months again - they have tobe
either insane or they have to be foot-
ball players.
These are the latter.
The same routine unfolds in every
state across this country, which val-
ues its football as dearly as it does its
freedoms. But there's something dif-
ferent about football in Ohio.
It might not be a way of life here,
but it's a big part of life. Communi-
ties are centered around high school
football teams; coaches are scruti-
nized as if they were coaching pro-
fessionals; players engulf themselves
in the sport. The state of Ohio is a
football hotbed, and the talent that

grows here and the intensity that
envelops communities speak to that.
It -is, without a doubt, the locus of
Midwestern football.
Brady Hoke knows all about Ohio
high school football. He's recruited
the state almost his whole coach-
ing career, which has most recently
brought, him to the head coaching
position at Michigan.
But Hoke also grew up here. He
saw the fervor firsthand as a line-
backer and center (and senior cap-
tain) for Fairmont East High School
in Kettering, a suburb of Dayton.
The passion permeates the state.
"Friday nights in Ohio are kind of
important," Hoke said.

Horace G. Prettyman arrived at
the University of Michigan in 1882.
He came from Bryan, Ohio, a town in
the northwest part of the state that's
closer to the Indiana border than it
is to Toledo, the nearest major Ohio
city.
A "forward" for each of the next
four years, Prettyman was the first
Ohioan to play on the Michigan
football team, three years after
the first-ever group of Wolverines
played their inagural game. He
was joined by other Buckeye State
natives beginning in 1886, and soon
the quality of these Ohioans sky-
rocketed.
Pontius Miller, from Circleville,
was the first Ohio-bred football
player to become an All-American
at Michigan as a tackle in 1913. The

next decade saw four
of his peers accomplish the
same, including Benny Friedman,
one of the most prolific quarterbacks
in school history.
Men like Prettyman and Miller
couldn't have known it at the time,
but they established a legacy that has
been central to the storied tradition
of Michigan football: dependence on
players who hail from Ohio.
"It's always been part of Michi-
gan's recruiting," Hoke said. "We
have two Heisman winners from the
state of Ohio."
They are Desmond Howard and
Charles Woodson. Hoke went on
to name other luminaries 'hailing
from the state, including Bo Schem-
bechler, Jerry Hanlon and Gary
Moeller.

"It's a big part of it. You've got a
state that's got great coaching, very
passionate about the game of foot-
ball," Hoke said.
To put it bluntly, Michigan's all-
time success could not have hap-
pened without Ohio-born players.
'The state of Michigan produces
some high-quality players, but not
enough to fully.support a dominant
program.
Ohio, on the other hand, pro-
duces enough players to supply
multiple progsins, and it has.
Recent Ohio-born Wol-
verines include players
such as Mario Manning-
ham and Shawn Cra-
ble. Redshirt junior
running back Fitzgerald
Toussaint and fifth-year senior safe-
ty Jordan Kovacs are two of the more
prominent names on Team '133' who
hail from the state.
All told, Michigan has had 126
separate players earn All-America
distinction. Twenty-one of them,
or about 17 percent, have been from
Ohio.
Twelve of those 21 All-Americans
have come in the last 43 years, dat-
ing from when Ohio native Schem-
bechler assumed control of the
Wolverines. The Ohio flavor has
been more pronounced ever since.
And it's only gotten stronger
under Hoke.

When Hoke was hired by Michi-
gan'in January 2011, he and his staff
made clear that recruiting the state
of Ohio would be an emphasis.
"Obviously being the state right
next door like it is, it's a high prior-
ity," said linebackersi coach Mark'
Smith. "And from the standpoint of
the quality of the football that's pro-
duced in Ohio, you'd be stupid not to
go in the state of Ohio."
Hoke was thrown into the fire
recruiting-wise due to the timing of
his hire, with National Signing Day
less than a month away. After mak-
ing sure the recruits who had already
committed to Michigan under for-
mer coach Rich Rodriguez would
be retained, Hoke went to work
on adding more players, including
four Ohioans - defensive end Keith
Heitzman, linebacker Antonio Poole,
defensive end Frank Clark and since-
departed cornerback Tamani Carter.
But Hoke's recruiting genius in his
native state fully emerged in recruit-
ing the class of 2012, his first full
group with the Wolverines.
All told, he signed nine players
from Ohio, including one five-star
(offensive tackle Kyle Kalis) and four
four-stars, according to-Rivals.com's
rankings. Three of them -
