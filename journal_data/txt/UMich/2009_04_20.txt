DUNKIN' ON THE DIAG

A SECOND TRANSITION
For transfer
students, a
struggle on
N. Campus

After a newspap er collapse

For tough transition,
76 percent of transfer
students placed on
North Campus
ByVERONICA MENALDI
Daily StaffReporter
When LSA sophomore Lauren
Mosena transferred to the Uni-
versity of Michigan from Pitzer
College in Claremont, Calif. in the
fall, she had two major challenges
ahead of her.
Â° Not only did she have to struggle
through Michigan's harsh winters,
but she also had to adjust to a com-
pletely new university - with new
professors, new classes and, hope-
fully, new friends. But because
she was placed on North Campus,
Mosena said that those were more
difficult tasks.
"It has been extremely hard to
meet people around me in North-
wood," Mosena said. "Everyone
who lives up here already has their
life here at Michigan figured out
and aren't necessarily looking for
new friends - alot of them keep to
themselves."
And Mosena's experience is not

an isolated one.
According to figures obtainedby
The Michigan Daily from Univer-
sity Housing, 76 percent of trans-
fer students for the fall 2008 term
- 199 of the 262 students - were
placed on North Campus in either
Bursley Hall, Baits I and II or the
Northwood Community Apart-
ments.- And of -those students, 91
percent - or 181 - lived in North-
wood.
University Housing Spokesman
Peter Logan said this trend is due
to the fact that the kitchen and
apartment-style living that North-
wood offers is appealing to older
students, and also that many trans-
fer students request it.
But Logan said the decision
is ultimately dictated by space.
Because the University is respon-
sible for supplying housing for
first-year and returning students,
transfer students aren't always
placed in ideal locations, he said.
"Transfer students are placed
where space is available in Uni-
versity Housing facilities that they
have requested or would be appro-
priate to their age and university
experience," Logan said. "We can't
always give a transfer student a
placement that they prefer, but we

p What becomes of a
community when its
local paper closes?
By CHRIS HERRING
Daily StaffReporter
When it became known late last
month that Ann Arbor's primary
daily newspaper, The Ann Arbor
News, would be closing its doors
in July, the obvious question fol-

lowed: Who's going to provide
local news content for the area?
And with dozens of papers hav-
ing closed since the start of the
year, it's a question that's being
asked across the country. At best,
the print newspaper industry is.
in a state of flux. At worst, it's in a
state of emergency.
To reduce costs, the Detroit
Free Press and The Detroit News
just scaled back home delivery to
three days a week. In the last two
months, two big-city dailies, the

Rocky Mountain News in Denver
and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer,
have closed and gone exclusively
online. The San Francisco Chroni-
cle and The Boston Globe have also
recentlyreceived threatsofclosure
from their parent companies.
Understandably, the fate of
major papers and their respective
cities has been the primary topic
of discussion when it comes to the
future of the industry. But little
has been said about how smaller
cities like Ann Arbor - and even

smaller towns -are being affected
when they lose their main source
of news.
In many cases, industry experts
and newspaper veterans say, small
communities have much more to
lose than major cities when their
primary newspapers fold. With
no apparent outlets to plug the
news holes left behind, residents
of small and mid-sized towns
are more likely to be uninformed
about the developments taking

UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION
A look inside how
the 'U' formulates
its' annual budget.

CAMPUS SOCIETIES
Order of Angell releases list of 2010 members

University officials
discuss how they
finalize the budget
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily StaffReporter
The University's budget is mas-
sive, to say the least. With totals of
more than $5.2 billion in operating
revenues and expenses at the Uni-
versity's three campuses, including
the University of Michigan Health
System and the Athletic Depart-
ment, it's easy to see why devel-
oping the University's budget is
almost a year-long process.
Despite the budget's enormity
and vast importance for life at the
University, very little about its for-
mulation is known to many mem-
bers of the University community.
Over the past two months, through
several interviews, University
President Mary Sue Coleman,
Provost Teresa Sullivan and Phil
Hanlon, vice provost for academic
and budgetary affairs, have offered
insight onto this rarely discussed
process.
The University's budget plan-
ning begins in the fall of the previ-
ous academic year. Upon direction
from the office of the Provost, the
dean of each of the University's
schools and vice presidents of each
executive office begin formulating

budget recommendations for their
respective units.
In an interview last month, Cole-
man said deans and vice presidents
are directed each year to look for
ways to cut costs.
"We understand that we're
going to have to take between land
2 percent out," she said. "We're just
goingto have to cut."
Coleman said the cuts proposed
must impact the quality of edu -
cation at the University as little
as possible, so as not to harm the
experience students receive on
campus.
In an interview last month, Sul-
livan said in addition to the cuts,
deans and vice presidents are
asked to reallocate an additional 1,
to 2 percent from low priorities to
higher priorities - to put emphasis.
on each unit's bigger goals. Once
this has been done and the propos-
als are completed, the budget rec--
ommendations are then reviewed
in budget conferences with the
provost.
In that March interview, Sul-
livan said this year's budget con-,
ferences began in January and
were expected to finish near the
end of March. She explained that
the budget conferences provide
an opportunity for deans and vice
presidents to present their budgets
and justify the amount of money
they're requesting.

Group includes 22
leaders of campus
organizations, teams
By EMILY ORLEY
Daily StaffReporter
Most students are fairly famil-
iar with the many clubs on campus
that comprise "the leaders and the
best" of the University. However
there is one club made up of prom-
inent leaders on campus that pre-
fers to work in silence.
Order of Angell, the senior honor

society started by and named after
former University president James
Burrill Angell, announced its new-
est class, "Pride of 2010," to The
Michigan Daily on Saturday.
Every year, a new group of
prominent organization leaders,
sports captains and influential
Greek representatives are select-
ed, or "tapped" by the outgoing
class to join the club and continue
its mission.
"It is an organization to advance
exceptional leadership through a
lifelong loyalty to and engagement
with the University of Michigan,"

CR IM E FORKING OVER YOUR MONEY
Kappa Sigma vandalized
by intoxicated student

By TREVOR CALERO
Daily StaffReporter
Ann Arbor police officers
responded to a call at a fraternity
house early Friday morning after
-a 20-year-old University student
reportedly smashed multiple
windows in the front of the house,
an Ann Arbor Police Department
official said.
Sgt. Andrew Zazula said when'
the officers arrived at the Kappa
Sigma fraternity at 806 Hill St. at
around 2 a.m. they found a front
glass door shattered and broken
windows on the front and side of
the house.
"The student said somebody
from that residence was giving
him a problem earlier," Zazula

said.
Kappa Sigma President Greg
Carmody said he was in-his room
with a couple of friends when he
learned of the vandal's presence
at the front of the house.
"Someone comes in my room
and says that someone is outside
with a metal pipe," Carmody said.
"I went downstairs and was try-
ing to calm him down and at this
point he started going off on me.
He was just in a state of uncon-
trollable rage."
The man, who was apparently
drunk, claimed that someone
from the fraternity had been yell-
ing at him from across the street,
Carmody said.

Gunmen seize two
foreign aid workers
An aid worker says gunmen have
kidnapped two foreign aid workers
in Somalia.
He says the Medecins Sans Fron-
tieres (Doctors Without Borders)
workers were seized in central
Somalia yesterday by around 25
gunmen traveling in two trucks.
The Somali staff traveling with
the two hostages were released.
One of the captives is European and
the nationality of the other is not
known.
The aid worker spoke on condi-
tion of anonymity because he was
not authorized to talk to the media.
Attacks on aid workers are com-
mon in Somalia. The government
accuses them of helping insurgents
and the insurgents accuse them
of being spies. Dozens have been
killed, kidnapped or threatened
within the past year.

Senate seat dispute
to be heard by state

Republican Norm Coleman's next
and possibly last gambit for regain-

before a Minnesota Supreme Court
that seems built to his advantage:
Five of the seven justices were put
there by Republican governors.
But Coleman's edge with the
court, which is expected to receive
the appeal this week of his election-
lawsuit loss to Democrat Al Fran-
ken, isn't all it seems.
Two of the GOP appointees
will sit out the appeal because
they helped referee the statewide
recount. A third has drawn fire for
past donations to Coleman's Senate
campaigns,
And the court as a whole has a
history of nonpartisanship in elec-
tion-law decisions.
While courts nationwide are
being increasingly drawn into polit-
ical disputes, few elections reach
this stage. Fewer still have such
stakes: A six-year Senate term vital
to the Washington power struggle.

judges want to see come their way,"

Obama says reaching out to
enemies strengthens U.S.

Obama calls for
closer ties with
Cuba, Venezuela
PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP)
- Defending his brand of world pol-
itics, President Barack Obama said
Sunday that he "strengthens our
hand" by reaching out to enemies of
the United States and making sure
that the nation isa leader, not a lec-
turer, of democracy.
Obama's foreign doctrine
emerged across his four-daytrip to
Latin America, his first extended
venture to a region of the world
where resentment of U.S. power
still lingers. He got a smile, hand-
shakes and even a gift from incen-
diary leftist leader Hugo Chavez
of Venezuela, and embraced over-
tures of new relations from isolat-
ed Cuban President Raul Castro.
"The whole notion was that if
we showed courtesy or opened up
dialogue with governments that
had previously been hostile to us,
that that somehow would be a sign
of weakness," Obama said, recall-
ing his race for the White House
and challenging his critics today.
ORDER
From Page 1A
Andrew Dalack, spokesman for
Order and co-chair of Students
Allied for Freedom and Equality,
wrote in an e-mail interview.
The core values of this year's
22-member class, as highlighted in
a press release, are "leadership and
character, passion and commit-
ment and diversity and humility."
"The class of 2010 looks forward
to improving Michigan through
an enduring commitment to hum-
ble service," Dalack wrote in the
e-mail.
While the club never officially
released its class list before 2006,

"The American people didn't
.buy it," Obama said. "And there's a
good reason the American people
didn't buy it - because it doesn't
make sense."
Still, Obama made sure to inject
some go-it-slow caution and clear
expectations for U.S. foes as he
capped his trip to twin-island
nation of Trinidad and Tobago
with a steamy outdoor news con-
ference.
On Cuba, he said Castro should
release politicalprisoners,embrace
democratic freedoms and cut fees
on the money that Cuban-Amer-
icans send back to their families.
Obama has lifted some restrictions
on Cuba, and Castro responded
with a broad, conciliatory over-
ture.
"The fact that you had Raul
Castro say he's willing to have his
government discuss with ours not
just issues of lifting the embargo,
but issues of human,rights, politi-
cal prisoners, that's a sign of prog-
ress," Obama said. "And so we're
going to explore and see if we can
make some further steps."
He did not, though, offer any
sign of lifting the crushing U.S.
trade embargo on Cuba, as many
the organizations records and his-
tory are open to the public.
Despite previous conflicts, the
organization is currently regis-
tered with the University and can
be found on Maize Pages.
Even though information about
the club is readily available, order
prefers to act silently.
"While some of our activities
are listed publicly, we seek to serve
Michigan without recognition,"
Dalack wrote.
The club, founded in 1902, was
referred to as Michigamua from
its inception until 2006, when the
group changed its name to remove
its allegedly racist reference to a
Native American tribe.
In 2000, during a takeover of

Latin American and U.S. lead-
ers want. Obama acknowledged
that the ti.S. policy in Cuba for
the last 50 years "hasn't worked"
but said change will be gradual.
In Washington, both Democrats
and Republicans said Sunday that
they wanted to see actions, not just
rhetoric, from Cuba.
"Release the prisoners and we'll
talk to you. ... Put up or shut up,"
said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.
"I think we're taking the right
steps, and I think the ball is now
clearly in Cuba's court," said Sen.
Claire McCaskill, D-Mo. "They
need to respond and say what
they're willingto do."
As for Venezuela, Obama's
friendly encounters with Chavez
at the summit drew intense
publicity - partly, Obama said,
because Chavez is good at getting
in front of TV cameras. Chavez's
anti-American rhetoric has, in
the past, led Obama to call him a
demagogue.
Obama returned to Washington
early Sunday evening. But even
before he got back, Obama was
facing condemnation from some
Republicans about how he dealt
with Chavez. "I think it was irre-

Mosena said that when she final-
ly managed to meet friends - who
mostly live on Central Campus - it
was more difficult to socialize with
them because she lived on North
Campus.
Adam Runkle, president of the
Organization for Adult and Trans-
fer Students, a student organiza-
tion dedicated to helping transfer
students adjust to life at the Uni-
versity,said many transfer students
have voiged similar concerns.
"I have had several students
complain of their placement on
North Campus because it hinders
their ability to maintain a social
life with other students on Cen-
tral," Runkle said.
Runkle, an LSA senior, said
many freshmen or non-transfer
students living on North Campus
already have a social circle, and
+hatft +maes- it ex+remely hard

for transfer students to adjust.
When LSA senior Tae Won Um
first arrived at the University, com-
ing from Korea, he understood that
he would probably have to learn
new customs, styles and slang. But
the culture shock that normally
comes with moving to a foreign
country was only exacerbated, Um
said, because he was placed in Baits
I on North Campus, isolated from
many of his fellow students.
Um transferred from Hankuk
University of Foreign Studies in
Seoul, South Korea, last year, and
said he has had trouble adjusting
to life at the University because of
where he lives.
"As an LSA student having all
classes on Central Campus, it was
neither a time-effective nor social-
ly engaginglife," he said.
With the libraries on Central
Campus having more resources
related to, his studies, he said, his
placement on North Campus made
life that much more challenging.
It also forced him to be conscious
of +the s cedule owhen Leoing to

study.
"The University needs to con-
sider more carefully when putting
students into dorms," Um said.
Jennifer Brown, an LSA junior
who transferred from Grand Valley
State University at the beginning of
this year, said she has mixed feelings
about her experience as a transfer
studentresiding on North Campus.
Brown was placed in North-
wood III with many other transfer
students that she said she probably
wouldn't have met if she lived on
Central Campus.
"Itiskindofnicetobe livingwith
other transfer students because
we are all going through the same
transition, and it is nice to have
others that you can relate to close
by," she said. "However, I know a
majority of the other students in
Northwood probably have not
had the same experience."
Brown saidshe also felt unnec-
essarily isolated living on North
Campus.

from the rest of the campus makes
the transition a little more difficult
than necessary. Especially when a
majority of my peers are lining on
Central and/or have already estab-
lished their own friendships, living
on North makes it harder to try to
mingle with other juniors."
In order to meet more students
and become more "connected"
with - Central Campus, Brown
joined Alpha Gamma Delta soror-
ity shortly after she arrived on
campus.
"North can be a deterrent to
becoming involved in academic
and social organizations," she said,
and joining the sorority has helped
her become more involved with
student activities.
LSA junior Kaitlin Terpstra-

Sweeney, who transferred from
Pasadena City College in Padadena,
Calif., said she couldn't completely
adjust to life at the University of
Michigan until she moved away
from North Campus at the end of
her first semester.
"It was a pretty lonely experi-
ence (living in North Campus),"
she said. "I just had transferred
this year from California, and
because I transferred from so far
away I didn't know anyone."
Terpstra-Sweeneysaidshemade
the decision to move off of North

t's no secret that the University of Michigan is stranded in the
middle of the Midwest. In cities like Ann Arbor and Detroit,
it's easy to feel disconnected from other metropolitan areas.
Students needing to travel often complain about the current options
being limited, expensive and inconvenient. Thankfully, President
Barack Obama has recently announced plans to build a nationwide
high-speed rail network of 100 miles per hour-plus trains. This
network would connect Ann Arbor to Chicago and Detroit,
providing students with much better options for sampling other
cities. At the same time, the plan would conserve energy and
create needed jobs. Such a plan should be implemented quickly for
the good of students, workers and the state.

Administrators need a lecture

The proposed plan identifies 10 cor-
ridors, one of which is the Chicago hub
network that would connect Chicago with
other metropolitan areas in the Midwest,
including Detroit. The broader goal of the
proposal is to relieve the congestion on
highway and airport infrastructure by giv-
ing travelers an efficient alternative in the
form of speedy, electric-powered trains. In
addition, the plan will also create short-
term and long-term jobs for the upgrading,
construction and maintenance of the rail-
road infrastructure.
With Ann Arbor on the Chicago-Detroit
rail route, this would make it easier for stu-
dents to get to Chicago and beyond much
faster than they do now. Besides opening up
new destinations for everyone, this could
also help out-of-state and international
students by giving them an option of flying
from Chicago, which can be cheaper than
flying from Detroit. But all students benefit
from easier options to travel long distances
in shorter amounts of time. Being located a
mere 2 hours from Chicago gives students
in Ann Arbor much better access to the
world outside the University community.
The state of Michigan also stands to
benefit from this plan. The high-speed
rail network would create both short-term
and long-term employment for Michigan,
which is dealing with the highest unem-

ployment rate in the country. The state
does not have an efficient and affordable
public transportation system to speak of.
This project would give it a much-need-
ed boost in infrastructure by connecting
parts of the state to Detroit, and Detroit
to other metropolitan counterparts in the
Midwest. This creates greater connectivity
between everyone who lives in Michigan,
which will undoubtedly be helpful as the
state inches toward economic revival.
A reliable nationwide rail network
would also ease the demand for air and
road travel and decongest clogged airways
and highways. And in doing so, it will make
the United States cleaner and greener. The
electric-powered trains would reduce
dependence on vehicles that burn harm-
ful fossil fuels. Reducing the number of
cars on the road and planes in the air could
decrease both air pollution and greenhouse
gas emissions.
While the plan has its critics, high-speed
rail networks like the French TGV and
the Japanese Shinkansen have been suc-
cessful, and there is no reason why such
a model can't be replicated in the United
States. This is a sound investment, from
an economic as well as an environmental
standpoint. It's an investment we need to
make to get our state and our country back
on track.

The other day, I bought a copy of the magazine Foreign
Policy at the local Borders and read the cover article on the
"Axis of Upheaval."After finishingit,Ewantedto armmyself
immediately, buy enough food for at least 40years and con-
struct a nuclear silo 20,000 leagues under the sea. World
destruction seemed imminent. Then, I decided maybe the
world's fate wasn't so dire - maybe Foreign Policy was just
publishedby over-anxious war hawks. SoI picked up a copy
of the magazine Foreign Affairs and read about Russia's
rapid destabilization and anticipated battles in the Indian
Ocean over sea control with burgeoning Indian and Chinese.
naval fleets.
At this point, I stopped reading and turned on the televi-
sion. CNN was showing pictures of a glacier in Antarctica
falling into the ocean as some really confused penguins
stared on in disbelief.o
I decided to take a nap. Between economic catastrophe,
international destabilization and climate change, there isn't
much to be optimistic about these days.
America finds itself in a precarious position, surround-
ed by rising international powers as it negotiates a tricky
financial crisis that has laid waste to the economy. But with
every crisis comes opportunity, and I think that the Obama
administration would do well to utilize this current melt-
down to make some fundamental changes. No, I'm not advo-
cating for universal health care, the nationalization of banks
or redistributive wealth programs. But if the Obama admin-
istration focused on using this crisis to spur investment for
new alternative-energy research or to help redesign our
infrastructure for a future without petrol, then America
could prepare to take an active role in world leadership on
combatingclimate change..
It's no secret that America hasn't been smitten with cli-
mate change initiatives over the last two decades, declining
to sign the Kyoto Protocol and emitting greenhouse gases
at a rate greater than any other country except China. But
with American businesses lining up outside the Congressio-
nal gates looking for bailout money, the Obama administra-
tion and Congress would have a perfect opportunity to help
alter practices within large American companies. Normally,
I'd be completely opposed to any government attempt at

regulating big business beyond health and safety code. But
in asymmetric economic conditions, when failed compa-
nies need taxpayer money to continue operating, I have no
qualms with tyingstipulations to bailout payments - stipu-
lations thatcould require companies to devote a certain per-
centage of the bailout money to alternative energy research
before receiving Uncle Sam's check.
The government is already encouraging private action
through General Motors and Segway's new P.U.M.A. cre-
ation. Part-Segway, part golf cart and part-rickshaw, the
P.U.M.A. attracted much attention during its recent beta test
in New York City. This was obviously an attempt by General
Motors to garner some positive PR, since many Americans
view the car manufacturer's troubles as a result of clue-
less management and cringe at the idea of taxpayer money
being used to help subsidize GM operations. But the idea
of using crises to help encourage new and innovative ideas
is very important. Given high barriers to entry for vehicle
manufacturing and energy development, the private mar-
ket would be unlikely to produce new and innovative ideas
without substantial subsidies. A project like the P.U.M.A. or
the Chevy Volt could require large government investment
to bring to market. Using the bailout money as a means of
enticing change in America's large companies would create
an opportunity for new projects that could help prepare our
infrastructure for the future.
To solve the climate change issue with any efficacy
beyond mere political rhetoric or pieces of purely symbolic
legislation, American private industry will have to fun-
damentally change. Whether that innovation begins with
companies like GM spurred on by stipulations tied to bailout
money or, perhaps more likely, with small entrepreneur-
ial start-ups focused on fuel-cell or bio-mass energy is not
important. What matters is that our government realizes
that no solution to the climate change issues will come from
congressional legislation, cap-and-trade systems or Al Gore
documentaries. Any real solution to the climate change issue
needs to disseminate directly from private industry, and this
crisis is a perfect opportunity to begin that transformation.

noms face is finding time between with perfect bodies and unlimited
fancy vacations and award cer- cash. These teen idols are hardly
emonies to count their millions of relatable figures for the typical

morals and a big old smile. Miley
Cyrus is Disney's go-to girl, and
her TV show "Hannah Montana"
is crazy-popular with the tweens.
In the past few years, Cyrus has
gone from daughter of a one-hit

because there's nothing the world

tion from my BLOCK
high expecta-
tions for your summer television-
watching schedule.
If I ruled the world, you would
all spend this summer watching
the first five seasons of "Lost," all
three seasons of "Arrested Devel-
opment," the sci-fi miniseries "The
Lost Room" and season one (I'll
spare you the rest) of "Heroes." But
it has been broughtto my attention
that some of you enjoy such luxu-
ries as eating and sleeping to such
a great extent thatyou would forgo
those higher TV pleasures. So for
you disillusioned readers, Iwill
direct you to the wonderful world
of the YouTube series.
The YouTube series is a mag-
nificent thing. As Britney Spears
would innocently put it, it's-not
a viral, not yet a TV show. A
series usually consists of 10 or
so five-minute episodes that you
can watch in a single evening or
space out for the entire summer
if you've got the willpower. They
range from the product of three
guys, two cases of beer and a shit-
ty old video camera to the work of
C-list celebrities with too much
time on their hands.
Now, obviously I wouldn't be
bringing these up if I didn't have
some in mind for you already.
Being the hoity-toity elitist I am,
I can't help but recommend the
classiest of YouTube's offerings.
First up is "The Guild," a tale"
of some misfits wholly absorbed
in their unnamed "World of
Warcraft"-esque video game.
There's the nursing mother who
finds going on raids more impor-
tant than removing the surge
protector from her infant's mouth,
the guild leader who clearly lost a
lot of money in a pyramid scheme
and the meek, redhead protago-
nist who one day opens her door
to see one of her fellow guild
members with blue roses and a
marriage proposal. With good
production values, decent acting
and an annoying-beyond-all-
reason theme song, "The Guild"
will entertain anyone who has
ever been or ever wanted to be a
complete nerd.
tfslayinggnomes and bring-
ing your own cheese to a cheese-
burger joint aren't your thing,
then maybe I can interest you in
the pseudo-how-to series "You
Suck at Photoshop." You can learn
to superimpose a picture of your
marriage license on a van wind-

shield, edit a wedding band off
your deceitful ex-wife's finger,
add a cat urine stain to your car-
pet and more. But the clincher is
that, despite the evident marital
problems the protagonist Donnie
hopes to edit away, he actually
teaches legitimate Photoshop
tools, because "you suck at Pho-
toshop - now let's waste another
five or six minutes of my life and
see if we can do something about
it." Waste of Donnie's life? Maybe.
Waste of yours? Most certainly
not.
For those who scoff at or at
least appreciate the potential
humor in the soap-opera melo-
drama, I've saved the best for you.
The subject matter of "Horrible
People" is exactly what it sounds
like. Throughout the story of a
money-grubbing mother trying to
marry off her son to a rich fam-
ily, one character is found to be
a chocoholic, at least four people
get killed, fecal matter takes a
starring role and a man tries to
impregnate a passed-out bride-to-
be with a turkey-baster. In other

summer day.
words, standard soap fare, hut in
five-minute bites.
These should be more than
enough to tide over the eaters
and sleepers among you. If not,
you can always check the other
nominees for best YouTube series
from the last two years' YouTube
awards (apparently we award
pretty much everything these
days). And come to think of it,
those of you who have the time to
get through all my other recom-
mendations probably have enough
time to get through these too.
So go and enjoy the freedom
of summer. Lie on a towel on the
beach, umbrella overhead and lap-
top beside you. Bask in the rays of
the sun and the glow of the screen
as you watch Donnie move a cat
from the couch to a trash bag.
Or spend the summer making
your own series. It's the perfect
chance to live out those this-
would-make-a-sweet-TV-show
dreams you probably have if
you're taking the time to read this
column. Who knows? You could
be the next winner of the presti-
gious YouTube award.
And with that on your resume,
you might actually be able to get a
job next summer.

the course of a single day, the album carries
a unique sense of movement and spontaneity
that is immediately enthralling: To put it sim-

Lerner is a self-professed fanatic of the Far
East, though he has never actually been there,
as he confesses in "Tokyo": "Only in my dreams
/'Cos they're all I know." The standouttrack is
a triumph of pop songwriting, reworking well-
worn melodies and progressions (The Strokes'
"Barely Legal" in particular) with its own
endearing brand of meat-and-potatoes power-
pop. Making the most out of basic arrange-
ments, Walla and Lerner layer the few overdubs
to create just the right amount of punch. The
careful mix of brevity and high velocity always
spells desire for repeated listens, and "Tokyo"
is a textbook example of the craft.

icon. He has managed to convince
millions of people they absolutely
need bizarre items like OxiClean,
the Bedazzler and Mighty Putty.
Of course, the next logical step
for the world's most famous info-
mercial tycoon is his very own TV
show, where he can yell at vulner-
able consumers for a full hour -
not bad for a guy who first starred
in two-minute commercials.

BUDGET
From Page 1A
Last week at Coleman's monthly
fireside chat - an event to which
a group of students are invited to
meet with the president and to ask
questions and share concerns about
the University - Royster Harper,
vice president for student affairs,
told students about her experience
with the budget conference this
year.
"We went into our budget meet-
ing, and we had squirreled away a
little money, and so the issue on the
table when we got there was 'What
are you going to do with all this
money?' she said. "We had squir-
reled it away for specific things that
we knew we were going to have to
replace or some equipment, so we
had our little list."
Harper said because the bud-
get she had presented looked too
large, she was forced to go back
and outline more specifically what
the money would be used for, so the
provost could review the budget
more carefully.
"When she saw the budget, it
was big at the bottom," she said.
"So we had to go back, make our
list and show her exactly why we
'didn't have what looked like a lot of
money."
Sullivan said after budget con-
ferences are finished, she joins her
budget team in reviewing the list of
priorities from each school or office
to determine what may be feasible
for the following year. At the same
time, Sullivan said her budget team
will review ways to control expens-
es through cost containment.
"If we can contain costs, that
makes a big difference in the bud-
get," she said, adding that the Uni-
versity has eliminated $135 million
in expenses over the past six years
because of cost containment.
The approximately $135 mil-
lion in savings has been due to
measures like changing how the
University orders and distributes
supplies, increasing energy effi-
ciency at several campus build-
ings and alternative strategies for
managing employee health care
benefits.
Sullivan stressed that in order to
protect the University financially
from year to year, cost containment
measures have to be permanent
solutions. For example, the Univer-
sity has renegotiated several con-
tracts with suppliers to gain more
favorable prices and switched to a
direct-delivery system -eliminat-
ing the need for a central office on
campus to deliver office supplies to
various schools and offices.
Sullivan said one-time cuts can
create a structural deficit - mean-
ing the expenses may return the
following year requiring the Uni-
versity to make deeper cuts or raise
revenue streams, like tuition, more
dramatically to cover the costs.
The University has had an equal-
ly long-term approach to other
aspects of its financial planning.
Approximately two years ago the
University switched from a five year
rolling average on payouts from its
endowment to a seen-year aver-
age to better insulate the Univer-
sity's endowment from changing
winds in the nation's economy. This
means the 5 percent annual payout
from the endowment is based on
the past seven years' performance,
which mitigates temporary spikes
or dips in stock markets and other
investments.
Coleman and Sullivan both said
the same conservative approach
would be taken with any money the
University might receive from the
federal stimulus package. Instead
of using the money to cover exist-
ing operating costs, both said the

money would be used for one-time
expenses, since the money would
not be available in the future.
Sullivan said throughoutthe pro-
cess she also receives advice from
multiple advisory groups that are
convened to offer advice about the
budget. Two such advisory boards
include the Student Budget Advi-
sory Committee, which consists of
students from campus that meet
with Sullivan on a monthly basis,
and the Prudence Panel, which has
members from the faculty, staff and

Monday, April 20, 2009 - 7A
students on campus:
In a meeting with Sullivan and
some members of the Student Bud-
get Advisory Committee last week,
committee members explained the
committee has met approximately
six times since it was founded last
fall. The committee, Sullivan said,
was created to bring a student voice
into the budget process and help
students learn about the Univer-
sity's budget process.
The Prudence Panel, which was
also formed earlier this year, is a
committee of faculty, staff and stu-
dentsthatmeetswiththeprovostto
discuss ways to cut expenses from
the general fund.
Sullivan said although the com-
mitteesmaynotmakerecommenda-
tions on cost-cutting strategies that
can be immediately implemented,
their recommendationsmay be able
to help cut costs in future years.
After all the recommendations
and budget proposals have been
received and discussed by the pro-
vost's budget committee, the pro-
vost and her staffwill work to create
a budget that will balance expenses
with expected rvenues.
Revenue streams to the Univer-
sity include appropriations from
the state, tuition paid by students,
endowment revenue, research
grants, and other fees charged for
services.
Some sources of revenue can be
restricted for certain activities. gor
instance, most endowment funds
are given by donors for a specific
purpose and can only be used for
that purpose, whether it be student
scholarships, endowed professor-
ships or special programs at the
University.
Other funding from the Health
System and the Athletic Depart-
ment is used by those entities and
does not enter the general fund -
excluding funds from the Athletic
Department that pay for student-
athlete scholarships and money
contributed for general financial
aid.
On the other hand, state appro-
priations can be used for any pur-
pose at the University. Coleman
said the fact that state appropria-
tion money isn't earmarked for any-
thing makes it especially valuable
to the University because it can be
used for any purpose.
Since 2002, the University has
lost $36 million of state appropria-
tions in nominal dollars and more
than $100 million in total of state
appropriations in real dollars -
which are adjusted for inflation
at the Consumer Price Index for
Detroit.
Sullivan said it can be very dif-
ficult to predict revenue levels
because the University finalizes its
budget in June, butthe state doesn't
finalize its budget until the end of
September - making it hard to pre-
dict state appropriation levels.
"We go to our board in June, but
thestatebudgetdoesn'tgetwrapped
up until Sept. 30 so we have to make
a guess everyyear about how much
we're goingto get," she said.
Last year was the first time the
budget was presented to the Uni-
versity Board of Regents in June.
Previously the budget was not pre-
sented until July. Sullivan said she
instituted the change so incoming
freshmen know their tuition rates
earlier in the summer.
Sullivan said in the past, esti-
mates have not always been accu-
rate, but that she tries to estimate
conservatively to ensure drastic
measures like a mid-year tuition
increase aren't necessary.
For example, Sullivan said last

year the University's estimates
were wrong last year, but that the
decision was made to absorb the
difference internally as opposed to
further raisingtuition.
"I have to be the most conser-
vative person about the budget on
campus," Sullivan said, "because if
I get it wrong, we all pay the price
for 12 months, maybe more."
The regents have unanimously
approved the University's budgets
- including those for each of the
University's three campuses and
the healthsystem- for the pasttwo
years. However, in 2006, Regent
Andrea Fisher Newman (R-Ann
Arbor) opposed each of the budget
proposals.

MONTANA
From Page 5A
starlet) getntoo serious or too real. While she may strug-
gle with "tough" decisions, like whether to go forward
with her Hannah duties or keep a dinner date with a
cutie cowboy - allowing for a montage in which Cyrus
changes clothing multiple times and annoyingly ruins
everyone's meal - there's little question everything
will work out in the end.
Miley will have her pink bedaxzled cake and eat it
too. Lest things get too intense, most of the supporting
characters in the film serve as mere comic foils, play-
ing for cheap laughs regarding runaway ferrets and
bottom-biting alligators. Miley may play pretend when
she is Hannah Montana, but her "home life" is hardly
more realistic.
'The film's only saving grace is Vanessa Williams
(TV's "Ugly Betty"), who plays into the movie's campy
vibe, projecting some fun into her portrayal of Han-
nah's savvy manager. Her snark is the only real humor
found in the film apart from the hilarious befuddled
faces of confused extras. Cyrus herself, while an OK
singer and actrels,is unsurprisinglyunlikable as Miley.
She acts spoiled and selfish, but, in the end, says sorry
and all is forgiven - hardly a true-to-life example of
teenage rebellion.
The film tries hard to tell audiences that Cyrus is a
relatable example of teenage life. Perhaps one just has
to walk a mile in her jeweled cowboy boots, butit's hard
to find a connection between the fantasy world of Han-
nah Montana and the real drama teens face. She might
just be a product of a more cosmetic generation of teen
idols who celebrate glitz over substance, but the adults
behind the production should have knownbetter.
TELEKINESIS
From Page 5A
one-two punch of "Tokyo" and "Look to the East," is
enough to keep listeners pleasantly on edge through-
out the first half of the album. Fortunately, the first
side packs enough firepower to keep the album afloat,
its particular strength countering the lackluster songs
that round out the disc.
Naturally, the album's quieter, duller moments are
revealed on its second half, after the sugar high of the
first has worn off. Here, one of the major hurdles of
pop records is revealed: How can a record keep listen-
ers interested throughout? Lerner has no answer. The
weaker songs decorating the album's second side feel
half-formed and uninspired. Tracks like "Great Lakes"
and "Calling all Doctors" seem hollow; the melodies
don't stick nearly in the same way and are easily throw-
aways in the face of the radio-ready "Coast of Carolina"
and the '50s pop balladry of "Awkward Kisser."
Luckily, the album ends with the pleasant, albeit
anticlimactic "I Saw Lightning." It highlights Lerner's
folkier tendencies, with just an acoustic guitar accom-
panying his admittedly thin voice to reveal a naked-
ness otherwise unexplored on the rest of the album.
Though it's easy to dismiss pop songs as trite or
derivative, it's damn near impossible to pinpoint what
makes them so infectious in the first place. The sound
is so much like Death Cab that Chris Walla may as well
have written half of these songs himself. Still, there's
no doubt that Michael Lerner brings a quality and
a knack for the pop craft all his own. Hopefully, the
future finds Lerner's Telekinesis moniker carving out
its own niche in the modern power-pop landscape -
but surrounded by such good company, he may never
need to.

The Michigan football team is no longer pursuing
former Duke point guard Greg Paulus, according to a
Scout.com report on Saturday.
On the Dan Patrick radio show on Thursday, Pau-
lus said he had an opportunity to compete at the
quarterback position at Michigan. He was at the
Wolverines' final spring practice Tuesday to meet
with Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez and talk about
potentially joining the team.
Paulus said that he has trained with the Green Bay
Packers as well as talked to several college teams.
An ESPN.com article from Wednesday reported
that Paulus had been offered by Duke football coach
David Cutcliffe the opportunity to try out for wide
receiver for the Blue Devils.
"He's a quarterback at heart, but there was no way 0
he was going to be able to compete and play quarter-
back for us," Cutcliffe said to ESPN.
Immediately after a FOXsports.com report broke
the story ofPaulus's visit to Ann Arbor, rumors began
to swirl about the point guard playing for Michigan
next season. Under NCAA rules, he could apply for
a waiver and, because he technically has one more
year of blanket eligibility, Paulus could come back to
college sports for one year should he choose to use it', I1

with Cal coming in a half a tenth
behind that.
Just one big mistake could have
dropped the Wolverines to fourth.
But Michigan put together its
best meet of the entire season
when it mattered most, posting its
highest NCAA finish since 2000.
And for the second straight night,
the Wolverines posted their high-
est team score of the season.
"Pretty, much everything
clicked," senior Joe Catrambone
said. "We've never, ever hit this
high. It was just one great routine
after another."
As the gymnasts predicted all
year, pommel horse was a differ-
ence-maker. The Wolverines chose
to start on the bye rotation, mean-

in gymnastics, been inconsistent,
he knew he could hit it on Friday
night.
So the Michigan coaches decid-
ed to pull Cameron from the vault,
thus preventing him from com-
peting in the all-around.
"I just talked to the coaches
about what would be best for the
team," Rosso said. "Basically, if put-
ting Chris in was best for the team,
then put Chris in. Or if having a
little more difficulty would be bet-
ter for the team, then take a chance
on me. Chris could have easily been
All-American, national champion
in the all-around, but he was will-
ing to give that up for the team."
Through the thick, hot air of
Minnesota's Sports Pavilion on
Friday night, Rosso pounded down
the runway. He flipped a total of
three times off the vault table,
landing in a deep squat and taking
one step back to steady himself.
"I was a little nervous, because
I was pretty much putting myself
out on the line," Rosso said. "Either
I was going to eat my words or I
was goingto live up to them."
He lived up to them - his 15.70
score tied for Michigan's second-

5 of 6 hit sets, with sophomore
Chris Cameron anchoring the
rotation. He was competing with
an injured shoulder held together
by an extensive tape job, but he
performed as if nothing was out of
the ordinary.Afterhis 15.30 set, he
tilted his head back and whooped.
Following a picture-perfect
rings rotation, in which Michi-
gan's four top gymnasts all scored
a 15.00 or higher, the Wolverines
headed for vault. And in what
became the story of the night, all
six vaulters performed to their
potential.
Still, of the teams who had
already gone on the bye, Michigan
was third. And coming up next
was parallel bars, the event that
had given the Wolverines prob-
lems for over a month.
Senior Ralph Rosso led off.
Over his career, Rosso's trade-
mark has been his steadiness, and
his hits are usually so predictable
that they can be easily overlooked.
On Friday, he did exactly what he
was supposed to do - get Michi-
gan started with a solid hit.
The Wolverines built off Ros-
highest of the night.
All through the competition,
Rosso was a rock-solid foundation
for his teammates. He led off the
recentlytroublesome parallel bars
with a hit routine - and the rest
of the event squad followed with
four hits in the next five sets.
"We talked about needing to
get off to a good start (on paral-
lel bars), and Ralph's been that
guy all year," Michigan assis-
tant coach Scott Vetere said. "He
doesn't have a high start value but
he's clean. And he did just that."
Rosso was a spark on the rings
and floor rotations as well, start-
ing strings of Wolverine scores
above 15 on both events.
For the senior, who was part of
the team that finished eighth and
out of the team finals in 2006, it
was a fitting end to his career.
"To go from eighth to second,
it was quite an amazing journey,"
Rosso said. "Just everything that
we've gone through, from the dis-
appointment to our triumphant
success, it's been worth it all."

so's success, as fourofthe nextfive
hit their sets. After senior Ryan
McCarthy stuck his dismount, he
began dancing and gesturing to
the fans to get louder. Cameron
bounced among his teammates
like an out-of-control Ping-Pong
ball after his 14.95'set, while Kel-
ley anchored with a 14.75.
When the Wolverines got to
high bar, the energy of team
and fans reached new heights.
Catrambone performed the same
set that earned him the Big Ten
high bar title, sticking his triple
backflip dismount. Kelley finished
the event with a 15.45 set, roaring
to his teammates.
"That was the moment for me
where I went crazy," Michigan
assistant coach Scott Vetere said.
"I think I could have jumped over
the high bar."
Heading into floor exercise, the
final event, Michigan was in third
behind Cal and second-place Stan-
ford. The two expected powers of
the night, Stanford and Oklahoma,
finished on rings and vault.
Michigan knocked out set after
set on the floor. Sophomore Ben

Baldus-Strauss finished his rou-
tine and ran in long leaps back to
his teammates' arms. Rosso, Cam-
eron and Kelley ended the night
with three straight scores above
15 - exactly what the Wolverines
needed to edge out the Sooners
for second place.
"You know, even though we got
second, this felt like '99 where
we won," said Vetere, who was
a freshman on the 1999 NCAA
Championship team. "You could
just feel that we were going to hit
routines. That's just a great feel-
ing and as a coach, I haven't had
that feeling since I was compet-
ing."
The Cardinal finished in first
place, but from the beaming smile
on the face of every Wolverine, it
was easy to believe they had won.
After the arena had emptied, they
even sang The Victors, the normal
celebration following a win.
"There were 15 of us, but
tonight we were one," Rosso said.
"We couldn't have done it without
each other. We had each other's
backs and we did it for the love of
each other."

Michigan squeaks out
win at archrival Indiana
for eighth straight title

By AARON SHAW
For the Daily
Winning CWPA Western Divi-
sion Co-Player of the Week last
weekend wasn't enough for senior
captain Julie Hyrne.
She played her best game of
the year yesterday, according to
Michigan coach Matt Anderson.
With her five goals Sunday, includ-
ing a SportsCenter Top 10-worthy
no-look, over-the-head goal as the
first half expired, Hyrne led the
Michigan water polo team to a 9-8
victory over Indiana for the CWPA
Western Division Championship.
The win in Bloomington wasthe
eighth championship for Michigan
coach Matt Anderson and is the
Wolverines' 22nd straight win this
season.
"It has taken a lot of hard work
to do what we have done," Ander-
son said through the Athletic
Department. "I am very happy
because the girls played well, and
they deserved it. They need to
enjoy this moment and then turn
their focus to next weekend."
After rolling past Penn State-
Behrend 14-2 in Saturday's quar-
terfinals and Gannon 17-4 in the
semifinals, No. 1 seed Michigan
came out strong in yesterday's
final against tournament host and
No. 2 seed Indiana. Hyrne's goal
as the clock ticked down gave the
Wolverines a 7-3 lead entering
halftime.
"I knew there was about three
seconds left on the clock," Hyrne
said through the Athletic Depart-
ment. "Keller (Felt) set it and I just
tried to get off a quick shot."
The third period began with a
resurgent Indiana team pressing
hard for the first goal, but senior
goalie Brittany May was there to
make save after save. May had two
crucial stops two minutes into the
third period when the Wolverines
(30-8) were on a double-ejection
penalty kill.

Kylee Botterman is on her way
to becoming one of the most deco-

The sophomore placed ninth
in the floor exercise at the NCAA

It was Botterman's second

is the first Michigan gymnast
to win the floor exercise title at
the Big Ten Tournament and the

Botterman scored a 9.875 at

"Even though she got the ball

Entering the final frame, the
Wolverines held a 9-5 lead. For the

OFILI: Leader and best in a Southern-dominated sport
From page 1B

Henry said it's human nature for
an athlete to pace herself based on
how other people are running, so it
should come as no surprise that he
likes Ofili to run alone.
"It's like acar being on the high-
way," he said. "If that car is around
a bunch of other cars going 55, the
fastest it will go is 60. But if Tiffa-
ny's on the highway by herself, she
can go about 80."
Ofili's motor has been running
faster than anyone else's for a while
now. After arriving at Michigan
in the fall of 2005, the freshman
promptly broke school records in
both the60- and 100-meter hurdles.
She currently holds the nation's fast-
est collegiate time in the 100-meter
hurdles (12.88) and hasn't lost in her
signature event, the high hurdles, in
almost a year.
The Ypsilanti native has clocked
such ridiculously fast times in her
four-year career that Henry often
has to come up with new ways to
push her in practices.
When her pharmacy school
schedule - 9:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. on
Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays
and 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Tues-
days and Wednesdays - allows her
to practice with her teammates,
Henry routinely puts his star ath-
lete at a disadvantage. He recently
started Ofili 10 metersbehind one of
her teammates in a 200-meter dash
to challenge her. She still managed
a tie.
Though her times have always set
her apart - she first broke Michi-
gan's indoor and outdoor hurdles
records as a freshman - the most
noteworthy thing about Ofili's
accomplishments is that they've
come in the cold-weather state of
Michigan.
Since 1982, when the hurdles
became an official event for the
women's national championships,
just Ofili and two others have won
national titles for Midwestern
schools. That-Ofili has four champi-
onships is unheard of - in the Mid-
west or otherwise.
While she finds Michigan's cold
weatherfrustrating,Ofilineverseri-
ously considered competing in the
South. Part of that had to do with
limited recruitment from there. She
also wanted to stay close to family
and study pharmacy.
Ofili takes pride in breaking
the stereotype that runners from
the North can't run as fast as their
southern counterparts.
"A lo ef athletes think that just

because they go to a certain school
that has a certain name that they'll
automatically do well," said Ofili,
who had practiced inside that day
because of April snow. "There's
more to it than that."
NOT YOUR.TYPICAL NATIONAL
CHAMPION
The 21-year-old has a wide range
of interests, most of which aren't
tied to athletics. She seemingly con-
trols her concern for sports like a
light switch. If she, her teammates
or her family aren't involved in a
sporting event, Ofili probably won't
take notice of it.
When one considers her family's
extensive sports history, it becomes
a bit easier to understand.
Her brother Alex, now 26, played
football at Michigan. Her oldest
brother, Frank, now 27, played foot-
ball at Toledo. Her 14-year-old sister
Cindy, who Tiffany lovingly calls
"Joobie Boodie," is a high school
freshman who plays basketball, vol-
leyball and just beganrunningtrack.
Ofili's father and uncles all ran track
in college, too.
"She'd rather be at home than go
to Michigan football games on Sat-
urday," said teammate Geena Gall,
who's roomed with Ofili all four
years. "She doesn't even buy sea-
son tickets or anything. She'll only
go to the games if we have a (track)
recruitvisiting."
Ofili said she has nothing against
sports - they just aren't high on her
list of priorities.
"IfI had a choice between watch-
ing 'House' and watching a basket-
ball game, I'd watch 'House,'" she
said.
That she enjoys the medical
TV drama is no shocker, given her
interest in medicine. After three
years as an undergrad inthe College
of Literature, Science and the Arts,
Ofili applied to and gained admis-
sion from the College of Pharmacy
last year. She's currently finishing
her firstyear in the program.
Pharmacy is among the four
things - God, family and track
being the other three - she con-
siders most important. She cares
about pharmacy so much that she
plans to earn her degree in 2012,
just months before that year's Sum-
mer Olympics, in which Ofili hopes
to compete.
Though striking that balance
sounds nearly impossible, those
closest to her say she'll be able to
accomplish both.

Ofili has derived some of her big-
gest loves from her parents. Her
interest in education can be tied to
her mom, who teaches first grad-
ers in Detroit. Her desire to go into
medicine comes from her Nigerian
father, who is a retired eye doctor.
The track star said her most-
prized attribute -her faith in God -
stems from her mother. Ofili attends
Sunday church services every week,
calling the routine something she
""never compromises."
She frequently discussed her
faith with her mother, Lillian, after
one of her teammates, Joi Smith,
died from a quick-spreading cancer
in Nov. 2007.
"That shook her up a lot," Lil-
lian said. "She talked about Jai a
lot. I just told her to stay prayerful
because you never know what may
happen in life."
Ofili heeded her mother's advice.
Shortly after her teammate's death
sophomore year, she made a vow to
run each race like it was her last.
"Joi's passing really made me dig
deeper and explore what's impor-
tant in life," Ofili said. "It's really
easy to get caught up in what's hap-
pening every day and not appreciate
things as much as you should. What
happened with Joi made me look at
things differently."
MOVING BEYOND OBSCURITY
In the three years that have
passed since Smith's death, Ofili has
become the nation's top collegiate
hurdler.
At times, using the word "domi-
nant" to describe her performances
would be an understatement. She's
reset her own records in the 60-
and 100-meter hurdles 12 times
(she shattered the 60-meter hurdles
mark three times in a four-week
span her sophomore year). Ofili
claimed her first national title as
a sophomore and has won her last
four NCAA championship meets.
She'll be the hands-down favorite
when she vies for a fifth consecutive
hurdles crown in June.
But she's still got more to prove.
Her dominance alone hasn't gar-
nered the attention of the trackcom-
munity - let alone her classmates at
Michigan - yet.
Asked why Ofili still competes
in relative obscurity, Henry cited
geography..
"If she were at a USC or a Texas,
she would be on the covers of track
magazinesbynow," said Henry,add-
ing that the lack of attention doesn't

bother Ofili. "Even most people in
our athletic department don't know
about her."
Ofili was close to changing all
that last year. She narrowly missed
qualifyingfor the U.S.Olympic Trial
Finals in the 100-meter hurdles, the
competition that determines which
American runners will go to the
Olympics. The race, in which the top
eight finishers advance, saw Ofili
come up just shy of the final spot.
Her finish, .004 seconds behind
the eighth-place finisher, was so
close that officials had to calculate

her time out to the thousandths (the
process is almost always done by
the hundredths). Only then did Ofili
find out that she'd placed ninth and
not eighth.
She called the process "bitter-
sweet," saying she was honored to
run against the best in the world,
but disappointed to finish so close
without earning an invitation to the
Olympics.
"It's definitely motivation for the
next time," she said.
Because of her youth - she was
the youngest of the top nine finish-
ers - andhercollegiatesuccess,Ofili
is expected to be a force to contend
with in the 2012 Olympic Trials. In
an effort to meet that expectation,
she plans to continue training on

campus with Henry after this year,
much like former Michigan swim-
ming coach Bob Bowman trained
Michael Phelps before the 2008
Olympics. Ofili expects her regi-
men to stay consistent while she's in,,
pharmacy school.
"Not having the block 'M' on my
chest will be the only difference,"
she said.
That and the fact that people will
know exactly who she is - at least
if she accomplishes what her coach
thinks she can.
"Ithink she'llhbreak the American
recordandtheneventuallybreakthe
world record someday," Henry said.
"When? I don't know. But as long as
she keeps the drive and fire that she
has now, I think she will do it."
