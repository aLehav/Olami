LSA senior Jacob Chludzinski has 

spent the last few weeks hunkered 

down in the comfort of his family home 

in Clinton Township, Mich., keeping 

up with schoolwork, finalizing plans 

for after graduation and enjoying 

family time. 

“Although the current situation 

is unfortunate, I am glad I have the 

opportunity to be safe at home with 

my family,” Chludzinski said. “The 

main shift has been trying to become 

accustomed 
to 
the 
‘Groundhog 

Day’-type routine we are all in. 

It is important to stay active and 

motivated, but these conditions have 

made it hard.” 

Chludzinski is one of the millions 

of Michiganders confined to their 

homes due to a statewide stay-at-

home order implemented by Gov. 

Gretchen Whitmer on March 10 that 

has recently been extended until 

April 30 in response to the spread of 

COVID-19. 

Michigan has been hit particularly 

hard, where the virus has infected 

more than 24,000 residents and killed 

more than a thousand. Detroit is 

considered to be the latest hotspot of 

the coronavirus, with the third-most 

cases and deaths in the United States. 

Whitmer, like most other state 

governors, 
made 
the 
emergency 

declarations at the request of public 

health officials, who say aggressive 

social distancing is crucial to saving 

lives as it prevents health care 

systems from becoming even more 

overwhelmed. 

However, the declarations have 

made 
Chludzinski, 
a 
member 

of 
the 
University’s 
chapter 
of 

Young 
Americans 
for 
Freedom, 

a 
conservative-leaning 
group 

advocating for limited government, 

and others wonder how individual 

liberties are being balanced with state 

interests in times of emergency. 

“I understood Governor Whitmer’s 

initial 
declaration,” 
Chludzinski 

said. “My initial reaction understood 

that we were entering a time where 

individual 
liberties 
would 
be 

compromised for the greater health 

and safety of our nation. However, it 

became clear almost immediately that 

the vagueness and uncertain timeline 

of several restrictions would lead to 

many constitutional questions.” 

Whitmer’s executive order limits 

gatherings, traveling and bans all non-

essential workers from going to work. 

In the recent extension of the order, 

Whitmer has now mandated that non-

family gatherings and vacation travel 

are strictly prohibited. The extension 

further 
regulates 
how 
essential 

business ought to run in order to 

promote everyone’s health and safety. 

Whitmer’s orders have limited 

the way Michiganders can exercise 

certain liberties. This has led some to 

question what the long-lasting effects 

of the pandemic will be on the way 

we think about states’ rights versus 

federal power and individual liberties 

versus these powers. 

When the University of Michigan 

urged its students to return home 

due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 

Education junior Nicole Afton 

moved back home to Kent City, 

Mich., a rural town with limited 

access to Wi-Fi and consequently, 

reduced access to remote learning. 

“Kent City is a super rural town, 

so I’m really limited in Wi-Fi 

options, and I didn’t have Wi-Fi 

at my house,” Afton said. “I had 

to buy Wi-Fi myself. I am also 

unemployed from my jobs. I have 

two, and I can’t work at either of 

them because they’re closed, so it 

was a financial struggle for me to 

figure out how I was going to buy 

Wi-Fi at home.”

Like 
Afton, 
many 
students 

from 
low-income 
families 
or 

rural areas returned home with 

more challenges than when living 

on campus. Purchasing reliable 

access to the internet without a 

source of income from on-campus 

jobs was at the forefront of many 

students’ struggles.

As a result, companies like 

Comcast 
are 
providing 
free 

Wi-Fi networks across the nation 

for low-income families trying 

to work from home. However, 

students from rural areas still face 

connection issues.

“Comcast, 
Spectrum, 
all 
of 

those providers were all offering 

free, and I called them and got 

denied because Kent City is so 

rural,” Afton said. “So I tried their 

options, and I was denied because 

where I live is in the middle of 

nowhere.”

Social justice virtual webinar 
features activists, students

Event highlights ways to remain involved with activism despite COVID-19

Students and community members 

attended a virtual webinar event on 

reproductive, 
environmental 
and 

criminal justice Saturday afternoon. 

Students for Reproductive Rights and 

Justice in conjunction with Earth Day 

2020 hosted the event. The webinar 

featured speaker Siwatu Salama-Ra, an 

advocate for the liberation and dignity of 

women, an organizer for environmental 

justice and a prison abolitionist. 

Salama-Ra 
also 
took 
questions 

from several students and community 

members about her experiences and 

highlighted ways individuals can get 

involved in activism even during the 

COVID-19 outbreak. 

Salama-Ra 
first 
introduced 
her 

platform by linking it to the global 

coronavirus pandemic, referring to our 

current time as a time of war. 

“Some would describe the days 

amongst us to be a time of war,” Salama-

Ra said. “The intersecting work of 

reproductive 
justice, 
environmental 

justice and climate justice are ingrained 

in my story, and I am grateful to share 

how community power and the power 

of story freed me from prison.”

In addition to organizing programs 

and legislation for these issues, Salama-

Ra said there is a need for a change in the 

culture as well. 

“In addition to all of the organizing to 

resist systems of oppression, we need to 

create a culture of care instead of cops, 

cages and surveillance,” Salama-Ra said. 

“This is why things like the approval of 

facial recognition in Detroit and in other 

Black cities is an assault on us all. If we 

really know that the criminal justice 

system had very little to do with justice 

and truth, we would all go down to the 

courthouse and disassemble it brick by 

brick.” 

Salama-Ra 
shared 
her 
personal 

experience with incarceration and 

emphasized the importance of change 

to our current justice system. 

“I, like so many others, are living 

examples of how prosecutors weaponize 

felony firearms and other heightened 

charges in order to corner people into 

taking plea deals regardless of their 

innocence,” 
Salama-Ra 
said. 
“This 

vicious system must come to an end. 

I saw nothing but Black and brown 

bodies going through what seemed like 

an assembly line into the jaws of this 

monster and there (were) no words 

to express how devastating it was to 

experience.” 

Salama-Ra continued by connecting 

her work within the prison system to 

environmental justice, showcasing the 

parallels that lie within these issues. 

“If a community is polluted and 

poisoned, it is also likely to be policed 

and prisoned,” Salama-Ra said. “This 

same system that exploits the planet 

and its resources is the same system that 

exploits our Black and brown bodies in 

the criminal justice system.” 

Salama-Ra discussed how an oversight 

bill to create an advisory committee 

in the prison system could improve 

physical and mental health of prisoners. 

Especially during the current COVID-

19 outbreak, these individuals are most 

vulnerable. 

“The oversight bill is so necessary 

now, more than ever, as thousands of 

people inside prisons and jails are most 

vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic,” 

Salama-Ra said. “My last outing before 

Governor Gretchen Whitmer closed all 

non-essential businesses was to the state 

capitol building where we introduce 

these bills.” 

She emphasized the importance of 

communities coming together to support 

a movement that connects prison reform 

and environmental justice. 

“I’d rather not be a leader in this 

movement — I’m no leader — I’d rather 

be part of a collective movement where 

all of us are leaders,” Salama-Ra said. “I 

survived something so damaging that our 

community was able to see up close what 

the prison industrial complex is, how 

aggressive it is and what it would take to 

abolish it … I invite you to join me on this 

path (in a) grassroots lead (organization) 

that connects all of these threads.” 

LSA sophomore Kiley Lowery asked 

during the Q&A portion of the talk 

about ways people can get involved in 

activism, especially during the COVID-

19 outbreak. Salama-Ra responded that 

individuals should connect with those 

who are in need and may lack support.

“Reaching out to loved ones who are 

imprisoned and need help navigating 

through isolation — be in contact with 

them,” Salama-Ra said. “The way that 

I’ve been handling it is staying in constant 

communication (with) people I know 

who need some support. Sometimes I 

do not have the support that they need 

and sometimes it is me forwarding a 

message and I reach out to people in our 

community who are more equipped (to) 

dealing with prisons, we call on our allies 

to intervene.” 

Public Policy senior Brianna Wells, 

president of the Students for Reproductive 

Rights and Justice organization, told The 

Daily these discussions are important 

especially during these unprecedented 

times. 

“Hosting this webinar with Siwatu in 

collaboration with Earth Day was really 

important for people to understand the 

intersections between racial justice, 

reproductive justice and environmental 

justice,” Wells said. “We wanted to shift 

the conversation about reproduction 

in relation to climate change from 

harmful rhetoric about overpopulation to 

conversations about how we build more 

just and sustainable communities in the 

face of climate crisis.” 

Wells also told The Daily this type 

of work is more necessary than ever 

amid the coronavirus pandemic, which 

disproportionately impacts vulnerable 

communities.

“This virus is not impacting everyone 

equally,” Wells said. “We’re reminded 

every day about the disproportionate 

number of Black lives that are being 

taken by COVID-19. Clearly, there’s 

something deeply wrong structurally, 

and highlighting the intersection of 

these injustices with personal stories like 

Siwatu’s can go a long way in getting to 

the roots of these problems.”

Government officials, at both 

the federal and state levels, have 

requested that families “stay home, 

save lives” to slow the spread of 

COVID-19, and to protect themselves, 

and those around them. Back in 

March, Michigan Medicine displayed 

a graphic showing how we can 

flatten the curve (slow the spread 

of COVID-19): if communities work 

together to slow the spread of this 

virus, the number of cases will 

stretch out across a longer period 

of time, allowing hospital beds to 

accommodate more people. Staying 

home and practicing social distancing 

can be a way families across the U.S. 

can help slow the spread of COVID-

19, but staying home is not the safest 

reality for everyone. 

On April 2nd, The Rising Majority 

— a coalition of allied organizations 

and movements formed in 2017 

— hosted a virtual teach-in with 

activists Angela Y. Davis and Naomi 

Klein to discuss movement building 

in the time of the coronavirus crisis. 

Angela Davis discussed the gendered 

violence of capitalism and how so 

many survivors of abuse are not able 

to retreat to a safe home during this 

pandemic: “This whole idea of ‘staying 

at home’ assumes we can retreat 

to a safe, nurturing environment, a 

refuge.” 

After viewing this teach-in and 

thinking about this insight from 

Davis, I shifted my attention to 

what staying home may look like for 

survivors of abuse and violence in 

unprotected conditions:

Violence 
against 
women 
and 

children is a public health crisis and 

staying home to slow the spread of 

COVID-19 has many impacts on those 

who cannot go to safe homes.

The National Domestic Hotline 

reported 951 calls between March 10 

and 24 that mentioned COVID-19; 

one caller from New York said her 

abuser threw her out the front door 

and kept their child after she woke up 

because she was not feeling well. Life-

threatening situations like living in 

abusive households place inexplicable 

pain on survivors to take part in this 

worldwide retreat to homes.

In Grand Rapids, Mich. alone, 

domestic violence cases have spiked 

48%, as reported by Kent County 

Prosecutor’s Office and some of 

the blame can be placed on the 

coronavirus; a prosecutor of Kent 

County voiced concerns of children 

facing abuse being unable to reach out 

to trusted adults for help like teachers 

due to remote learning. 

Furthermore, there are many 

impacts on those who do not have 

safe homes and those who may be 

economically dependent on their 

abusers; financial uncertainty for 

some can prevent them from leaving 

home — even outside of this pandemic 

as cases have spiked during times of 

economic crisis. The CEO of the 

National Domestic Violence Hotline, 

Katie Ray-Jones reported to TIME 

magazine that the calls they have 

received have ranged from “abusers 

threatening to throw survivors out on 

the streets so that (the survivors will) 

get sick” to “(withholding) financial 

and medical resources”. 

Advocates 
are 
still 
providing 

resources for those experiencing 

violence and abuse. As reported by 

the director for the legal project at 

two justice centers for New York’s 

Sanctuary for Families — a shelter 

that provides legal and counseling 

services for women and their children 

— “though New York shelters are 

considered essential, many domestic 

violence service providers are not 

seeing as many clients because of the 

virus and are moving their services 

to online.” But hotlines are still open 

and some states like Philadelphia 

have set up online databases where 

individuals can request protection 

against their abusers. 

Keep in mind that not everyone 

has the ability to go to a safe home 

nor remain there during this crisis 

- staying home is a privilege. To 

provide allyship to those you may 

know who are living in unsafe spaces, 

ask them how you can support 

them in this time and provide 

them with local resources in a safe 

manner, so that their livelihood is 

not compromised. Linked below is a 

website that provides resources for 

those experiencing homelessness, 

those who identify as survivors and 

those seeking support for domestic 

and sexual abuse; these resources 

have been combined by national 

organizations 
and 
community 

organizations. 

If I stretch my memory as far back 

as it’ll bend, I can remember the first 

time I had to teach myself how to 

breathe again. My parents had gone to 

a fundraiser, leaving me alone with my 

sister and my brother. I don’t remember 

exactly why, but I remember I needed 

to talk to my mom on the phone. For 

whatever reason, maybe because they 

thought I was too much of a mama’s 

girl or maybe they wanted to mess with 

me, my siblings wouldn’t let me call her. 

Then there was this pressure on my 

chest, a feeling that I can only compare 

to someone taking a dull spoon and 

carving out your heart, and I couldn’t 

breathe anymore. I started sobbing 

uncontrollably and begged them to let 

me use the phone. I was maybe 7 or 8, 

but the possibility that this might be the 

last time I got to talk to my mother or 

that something horrible would happen 

if I didn’t hear her say she loved me 

that night overtook me. My hands went 

numb, and I’ll never forget sitting in my 

room alone, desperately trying to coax 

air back into my lungs.

There are so many little moments 

like that from my childhood that my 

family and I had chalked up to me being 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 , being sensitive, a crybaby, 

but which read like undiagnosed 

anxiety when I write them out. I 

love my family so much, but I felt so 

misunderstood. For so much of my life, 

I internalized that view of myself — 

that I was a crybaby, irrational, prone 

to over-dramatic displays of emotion 

for no reason — and for a long time, 

it stopped me from developing any 

security in my emotions. I am normally 

the first to apologize, I let countless 

makeup technicians and hairstylists 

fully fuck up my face because I don’t 

know how to speak up for myself, and 

I tread so lightly around everyone’s 

feelings because they must be more 

valid. It wasn’t until I was much older 

and I spoke to a therapist that I had the 

language to describe what I was going 

through. It was hard hearing that I 

showed very classic signs of clinical 

depression and anxiety, but for the first 

time I could trust my feelings as being 

real and valid and not just a creation 

of my melodramatic mind. Most 

importantly, they were something I 

could control.

We all have these stories about our 

lives we tell ourselves in our heads, 

again and again, until they become our 

reality. I never told my parents about any 

of this, because being misunderstood 

had become a core part of my story. I 

equated coming from a culture that 

doesn’t 
prioritize 
understanding 

mental health to my parents simply not 

caring about mine. I would get so angry 

at them for not sympathizing with 

a struggle I never made the effort to 

explain to them. I resented them, a little 

bit, for being a barrier in my attempts to 

get better. I told myself I was alone in 

this, I had always been alone, and there 

was no point in asking for help. 

Ironically, amidst all this social 

distancing, I no longer had the choice 

to isolate myself. Being quarantined 

with my family day in, day out means 

that all of my emotions are on full 

display for them to see again. Despite 

my best efforts to hide how hard this 

whole pandemic was for me, my mom 

walked in on me one night mid-panic 

attack. My hands were shaking, my 

mouth gaping, gasping for breath, I was 

suddenly a child again. Except, I wasn’t 

alone this time. My mom immediately 

put her hands on my back and told me 

to breathe. I could feel the hesitant 

judgement and confusion attached, but 

she stayed with me for however long it 

took me to calm down. That willingness 

to meet me where I am meant the world 

to me.

A universal gap in knowledge for 

most first-generation immigrants is 

understanding that just because their 

parent’s love and support doesn’t show 

up how they want it to, it doesn’t mean 

it isn’t there. We speak our love (among 

other things) in different languages. 

Our parents only know what it is to 

try to survive in this country and they 

want the same thing for us. They didn’t 

have the luxury of self-actualization. 

There was always a bigger problem. 

Emotional needs were always a barrier 

to be buried. It doesn’t mean they don’t 

care. When I decided to look for it, love 

was there. Even if my mother couldn’t 

fully grasp what I was going through, 

she still sat there and breathed with 

me. And what a great miracle it is now 

to share a breath. That’s all that really 

matters, all that I can expect.

The new FX series titled “Dave” 

is a semi-autobiography of David 

Burd, played by himself, who goes 

by Lil Dicky on stage. Yes, it is a 

corny dick joke and yes, I kinda 

love it. Moving on.

We follow Lil Dicky’s journey as 

he’s trying to make it in the music 

industry and become the greatest 

rapper 
alive. 
Along 
with 
his 

friends Mike (Andrew Santino), 

Elz (Travis ‘Taco’ Bennett), and 

GaTa (played by GaTa himself), 

they experience the ups and 

downs of what it means to be a 

new artist on the scene with a lot 

to prove. While the show only has 

six episodes released on Hulu so 

far, I’m a fan already. It’s goofy, 

adorable, cringy, relatable and 

really fucking funny. 

I value seeing heartwarming 

relationships on-screen so I was 

thrilled to see such endearing 

friendships 
develop 
quickly 

throughout the first six episodes.

One character, in particular, 

seems to be a fan favorite already. 

GaTa is Lil Dicky’s hypeman, the 

person on stage with a rapper to get 

the crowd excited, and succeeds in 

bringing a pure and lighthearted 

aspect to the group’s dynamic. 

In the show, he’s a new member 

of the friend group after meeting 

Dave outside of YG’s studio in the 

first episode. So far, GaTa’s already 

stealing scenes and showing off 

his chops in his first acting role. 

He’s the kind of character that 

does something so unexpected and 

unfiltered that you just have to 

laugh in disbelief. I would compare 

his character to Darius played by 

LaKeith Stanfield in another FX 

show called “Atlanta”.

In the fifth episode titled, “Hype 

Man” the audience sees a more 

serious side to the show. After 

a failed rehearsal where GaTa 

becomes overwhelmingly ‘hype,’ 

he later reveals he has bipolar 

disorder. We see a heartbreaking 

flashback of his manic episodes 

and his diagnosis. The reaction to 

GaTa’s disorder is validating and 

what I think most people would 

hope to receive after opening up to 

their new friends. 

This episode was a very pleasant 

surprise. I believe the portrayal of 

people with mental illnesses has 

become increasingly positive in the 

media over the years, and “Dave” 

did a valiant effort of showing that 

mental illness is not an anomaly. 

GaTa tells us that the people who 

you may least expect — hypemen 

whose entire job is to uplift the 

energy in the room— might be 

suffering in silence in the hopes of 

making everyone else feel better.

After the episode aired, GaTa 

posted a video on Instagram 

thanking viewers for their kind 

reviews of his acting, however not 

all of it was just a role. He shared 

that events such as his manic fit at a 

shoe store with his mom to getting 

kicked off tour buses after making 

other artists uncomfortable, were 

almost completely accurate, along 

with the fact that he does have 

bipolar disorder in real life.

He shares, “I’m just here to 

inspire yall… I just want mental 

health awareness. I want people 

to take it very seriously, especially 

while 
we’re 
going 
through 

this,” (referring to the current 

quarantine measures most people 

are taking).

While “Dave” has been comedic 

relief for me during these trying 

times, seeing GaTa’s story has been 

extremely influential to me and 

viewers like me who also suffer 

from mental health difficulties. 

If you need a break from the 

craziness of self-isolation, take a 

break from reading the news, give 

“Dave” a try, and most importantly 

take care of yourself.

What Does ‘Staying Home’ Look Like during COVID-19?


S

helter-in-place: day one. I felt 

exceedingly optimistic. I was 

free from the binding shackles of 

my three jobs and 18 credits, and I now 

had time to do things I was forced to 

neglect. During the week, I would be able 

to devote more time to studying for each 

of my classes, and I could enhance my 

understanding of the lecture material by 

engaging more in-depth. I could dedicate 

my weekends to self-care and relaxation. 

I finally had time to engage with my 

favorite hobbies like working out, creative 

writing, painting and playing with my 

baby Yorkies. The coronavirus might have 

been ravaging the United States, but I 

was safe inside my house. My mother had 

stocked up on food, emergency supplies 

and, most importantly, toilet paper. Life 

was going to be good. 

I may have only been sheltered-in-

place for 17 days, but it feels like at least a 

couple of years. Seventeen days with my 

two older sisters and middle-aged parents 

have been illuminating. Seventeen days 

living in constant fear of contracting the 

deadly virus from my father, who is a 

doctor, or God forbid transmitting the 

virus to a loved one, has been stressful. 

Seventeen days spending more than 

18 hours per day in the same room and 

more than 23 hours per day in the same 

house has been boring. 

With modern technology, there is 

almost an infinite number of ways to 

pass the time, but to paraphrase the 

cinematic masterpiece “Phineas and 

Ferb,” the problem for our generation 

is finding a good way to spend it. The 

first instinct for many is picking up our 

phones to pass the time. We’ve been 

texting our exes, organizing Zoom 

calls with our friends and shooting our 

shots in Instagram comment sections: 

But what have we really been doing to 

ourselves? 

Our reliance on social media has 

increased tenfold since social distancing 

guidelines have been in effect according 

to Kimberley Lee from the Mental 

Health Association in Springfield, Mass. 

In her words, “(Social media) is an 

opportunity for us to stay connected, stay 

informed,” in order to transform social 

distancing into just physical distancing. 

From that perspective, social media has 

undoubtedly served as a positive force 

in our lives. It has reconnected us with 

friends, family and the greater world 

around us. However, as we all know, the 

overuse of social media can have some 

precarious effects on our mental health. 

Social media websites like Snapchat, 

Twitter, Facebook and Instagram were 

crafted to function like drugs in order to 

turn users into addicts. Every like, view 

and re-share releases a bit of dopamine, 

which 
is 
the 
neurotransmitter 

responsible 
for 
increased 
energy 

and happiness levels. (It is also the 

neurotransmitter that cocaine releases). 

Thus, 
the 
emotional 
stimulation 

received creates a relationship for 

young people between using these 

social media sites and happiness, so 

we begin wanting more. We use these 

platforms more actively: keeping our 

Snapstreaks, tweeting our hot takes, 

bragging about our kids on Facebook — 

or at least that’s what my dad does — and 

posting dances on TikTok. Social media 

addiction is already a prevalent concern 

in our modern society, but quarantine 

is 
immeasurably 
exacerbating 
our 

addictions with potentially frightening 

consequences. 

At the end of the day, each of us has 

been trying our absolute hardest to 

escape the unconscionable fear of death 

and overwhelming dread that seems 

to creep up on us more and more each 

day. We inevitably use social media as a 

distraction from our darkest thoughts, 

and that’s an understandable instinct. 

I’ve been doing it too. However, taking 

a step back to write this article has 

been therapeutic because it has forced 

me to analyze my own actions and 

contextualize them through the lens of 

this terrifying era in which we currently 

operate, so I encourage you to do the 

same. And no, I do not mean become an 

opinion columnist for The Daily.

Start a journal. Write down how 

you feel about quarantine or your sleep 

schedule or how you cannot stand Dan 

and Serena’s breakup at the end of 

season one of Gossip Girl because they 

were the perfect couple who restored 

your belief in love … or whatever else is 

occupying your headspace. This practice 

can help clear your mind and allow you 

to have a fresh perspective on life. At 

the end of quarantine — whenever that 

glorious day comes — you can look back 

on how this period has changed you, and 

you can carry the lessons of quarantine 

back into normal life. 

There are theories that Generation Z will 

be nicknamed “the Corona generation.” 

Even though I’m partial to “Zoomers,” I 

do not object to that characterization — it’s 

better than being known for participation 

trophies like Millennials. It speaks volumes 

about the defining period that we are all 

now living through together. However, this 

characterization does prompt one central 

question: What will we learn from this? 

Will we come out stronger, more 

grateful for our friends and family? Will 

we come out jaded, angered by the federal 

government’s slow response that cost 

thousands of lives? Will we come out 

unchanged because we spent the whole 

time laughing at Vanessa Hudgens’ memes 

and having our ears violated by the worst 

rendition of John Lennon’s “Imagine,” 

courtesy of Wonder Woman? 

Historians will be better able to 

answer these questions than I can and, 

truthfully, everyone will have their own 

experiences. But I believe we should take 

this unique opportunity to change our 

lives for the better. Bettering our lives only 

requires a few minutes a day, whether 

that’s anything from journaling to an abs 

workout. We have already let Auntie Rona 

take away our sense of security. We can’t 

let her take our futures as well.

FROM THE DAILY

The need for statewide rent and mortgage relief measures
T

he economic fallout created by COVID-19 is already enormous. With an 
expected long recession to follow once relative normalcy resumes, 
many renters either already have or will lose their source of income. As a 

result, calls for rent strikes and collective action to pressure landlords into waiving 
rent fees are spreading. Though the current era of economic despair brought by 
social isolation is unprecedented, tenants should consider the consequences of rent 
strikes — and shy away from them. Instead, renters should urge their governors 
and representatives to show more transparency in their decision-making processes 
behind rent forgiveness, freezes and eviction suspension executive orders. 

The COVID-19 crisis has caused a 

drastic increase in unemployment 

as businesses close their doors. As 

such, many University of Michigan 

students have lost campus or 

non-essential 
jobs. 
Moreover, 

many others will not receive any 

funds from government stimulus 

because they have been claimed as 

dependents by others elsewhere. 

In addition, students living off-

campus were strongly urged by 

the University to return home, 

meaning rented properties are now 

largely unoccupied. In this time of 

uncertainty, tenants and landlords 

alike are under immense financial 

stress. To mitigate these hardships, 

there must be a governmental 

incentive to allow for these missed 

rent payments. The city of Ann 

Arbor along with Gov. Gretchen 

Whitmer must freeze rent and 

mortgage payments until after stay-

at-home orders have dissipated. 

In this case, tenants will have the 

ability to regain a source of income 

and, in turn, the ability to pay off 

the rent. 

Michigan’s 
current 
eviction 

suspension 
order 
lasts 
until 

April 17. This date is rapidly 

approaching, and unless Whitmer 

signs an extension to the order, 

landlords will be able to resume 

eviction processes for non-paying 

tenants. 
However, 
based 
on 

current projections, the COVID-

19 crisis will most likely last far 

beyond April. As such, stay-at-

home orders may continue into 

the summer months, meaning 

tenants with non-essential jobs 

may be without income for the 

foreseeable future. Such tenants 

may see the organization of a rent 

strike as appealing, though this 

movement could ultimately be 

more damaging than helpful due 

to the usually hostile relationship 

between tenants and landlords. 

Rent strikes are extremely difficult 

to coordinate, especially during 

a 
pandemic 
when 
in-person 

organizing 
efforts 
and 
face-

to-face meetings are out of the 

question. With stay-at-home orders 

mandated and social distancing 

efforts, even if tenants managed 

to organize a rent-strike, the legal 

action many tenants may face after 

the COVID-19 pandemic could be 

financially devastating. 

Leigh Higgins, an attorney at 

the D.C. Tenants’ Rights Center, 

urges tenants to try to arrive at a 

compromise with their landlords, 

whether that be payment plans, late 

payments or the temporary waiving 

of eviction notices. This stems from 

the fact that even though landlords 

cannot legally charge late fees for 

rent or other payments while their 

geographical region is under a 

state of emergency, once the courts 

open back up, landlords could 

retroactively take legal action in 

the form of evictions or mediation 

of 
their 
lost 
compensation. 

Additionally, 
if 
tenants 
must 

withhold their payments due to the 

current state of emergency that the 

pandemic has implemented and the 

landlord ultimately decides to evict 

in a few months, this eviction record 

could be incredibly detrimental to 

the individual for years to come. 

An eviction record can sabotage 

an individual’s ability to secure 

housing or financial aid for years 

unless the respective record is 

sealed. This is because landlords 

can easily search for a potential 

tenant’s name, as eviction records 

are publicly accessible. Higgins 

adds that many landlords simply 

make their decision based on the 

presence of an eviction record alone, 

not taking the time to dig deeper 

to see if the case was dismissed or 

not. Unfortunately, this signifies 

to landlords, many times without 

any form of further investigation, 

that the prospective tenant isn’t 

trustworthy, reliable or a good 

option to inhabit their property. 

Further, advocates for legislation to 

seal these records argue that judges 

may not be sympathetic after the 

pandemic when the goal of the 

tenants was for landlords to cancel 

rent instead of the traditional 

fight to improve living conditions. 

For these reasons, The Michigan 

Daily Editorial Board believes that 

the best course of action for Ann 

Arbor residents is to reach out to 

the landlords and express their 

concerns while also contacting 

Whitmer and other representatives 

in hopes of a transparent plan of 

action and timeline regarding rent 

and mortgage payments for the 

state. 

Drastic times call for drastic 

measures 
and 
exceptions. 

Unfortunately, landlords are not 

going to forgive rent payments 

without 
city 
or 
state-wide 

measures. This leaves it up to 

the tenants to either attempt to 

organize a building or property-

wide strike or to reach a sense of 

compromise with the landlord for 

payment plans, payment reductions 

or 
optimistic 
cancellations 
in 

this dire time of need. Many 

tenants, especially those of lower 

socioeconomic status or individuals 

who 
already 
lived 
paycheck-

to-paycheck, may not have the 

privileges to work from home or 

to be, in any sense, comfortable 

without normal income. Therefore, 

for many renters, the ability to pay 

rent is contingent on their ability 

to work and accordingly, the end 

of stay-at-home orders, which is 

predicated on the resolution of the 

COVID-19 pandemic. 

This is a very complex issue, 

as is everything impacted by this 

crisis. In order to make progress in 

the right direction, local and state 

government officials must step 

up to make sure both tenants and 

landlords have collaborative and 

legal tools in place to recover from 

this emergency.

A

s an introvert, I have been 

in some way, shape or form 

preparing for this moment 

for my entire life. I had used Zoom 

before a few of my classes made 

the switch to virtual meetings on 

the platform, and I was no stranger 

to the virtual learning world. I 

used Google Hangouts before it 

was cool or necessary. I regularly 

swipe through videos on TikTok, 

which is apparently a quintessential 

Generation Z activity. 

And 
still, 
with 
all 
of 
that 

generational knowledge, I ran into 

all sorts of questions during the start 

of my online courses a few weeks 

ago. Could I be more informal in my 

class’s BlueJeans chat than I would 

be in a class email? How am I possibly 

going to take an exam online? Are 

other people also realizing that 

this particularly useless meeting or 

mandatory in-person seminar could 

have just been an email? 

My initial opinion 

about 
shifting 
from 

in-person 
classes 
to 

online meetings was 

largely 
negative. 
It’s 

definitely been difficult 

to retain information 

and 
remain 
focused 

during 
these 
online 

sessions, 
and 
many 

students I’ve talked to 

have expressed similar 

feelings. During class 

and during my newly-

expanded amount of 

free time, I am having difficulty 

motivating myself to do anything 

at all. I miss my classmates and 

roommates a whole lot, and I miss 

studying with friends. I miss being 

employed. I miss certainty, routine 

and structure. 

In particular, I miss my roommate’s 

Muddy 
Buddies. 
That 
is 
not 
a 

euphemism for something weird or 

kinky — one of my roommates makes 

this delicious snack (also known 

as puppy chow) that simply tastes 

like joy and whose components 

yield zero health benefits. There 

is perhaps an argument to be made 

in defense of the peanut butter, 

but the rest of the ingredients for 

Muddy 
Buddies 
(confectioner’s 

sugar, cocoa, butter, etc.) have 

about as much nutritional value 

and addictive quality as the average 

mango Juul pod. I thought that my 

exodus from Ann Arbor would mark 

the end of my roommate’s delicious 

treats for the house to enjoy. My 

sister has a vicious allergy that 

could require hospitalization if she 

were to ingest a peanut, and in this 

time of crisis, messy peanut butter 

foods are to be strictly avoided in 

my household. Imagine my surprise 

later, standing in the half-empty 

Detroit 
Metropolitan-Wayne 

County airport, as I spotted some 

Chex Mix Muddy Buddies ripoffs 

on the way to my gate. I impulsively 

bought two bags. 

It is hard to describe the taste 

of Muddy Buddies à la Chex Mix. 

I suppose it tastes like giving 

up, if that were something one 

could taste. Whereas snacking on 

my 
roommate’s 
Muddy 
Buddies 

provided me with the carelessly 

optimistic sense that everything in 

the world might just turn out OK, 

crunching 
on 
these 
artificially-

flavored 
bad 
boys 
evoked 
the 

anxiety of a mediocre English or 

theater major graduating into one 

of the worst job markets in recent 

history. If you were to rip open the 

dark belly of all human despair and 

venture into the gunk of its fleshy 

depths, you’d find those peanut 

butter chocolate Chex Mix bags. 

As a recent Harvard Business 

Review 
article 
suggests, 
the 

coronavirus 
crisis 
will 
create 

indelible 
changes 
within 
the 

United States. and abroad. It’s 

unclear exactly how the massive 

shift to online college courses will 

impact the future of learning at the 

University of Michigan, or other 

educational 
institutions 
in 
the 

long-term. A nation-wide survey 

of college students have found the 

psychological effect of their school’s 

shutdown to be significant; many 

survey respondents reported higher 

levels of depression and anxiety. This 

should come as no surprise given the 

abrupt changes in daily 

student life: 52 percent 

of 
respondents 
had 

been unexpectedly laid 

off from a job or had 

their hours cut back, 

28 percent lack reliable 

access to healthy meals 

and 20 percent lack 

reliable access to a 

mobile device or WiFi. 

Statistics 
like 

these 
illustrate 
my 

biggest concern with 

the 
“we’re 
in 
this 

together” style of guidance to those 

feeling dejected about the crisis. 

Some students have the means to 

make it through the coronavirus 

pandemic with very few disruptions 

if any at all, as suggested by the 

21 percent of survey respondents 

who 
expressed 
no 
significant 

changes in their lives due to the 

coronavirus. Some students may 

be forced with the decision to 

withdraw from their studies. Many 

students will lose loved ones. We 

are not, in fact, all in it together. 

This is perhaps something we forgot 

amid the confusion of President 

Donald Trump’s response to the 

coronavirus, the shuffling closure 

of many public places like libraries 

or restaurants or the bizarre frenzy 

of the supermarket rush for — of all 

things — toilet paper.

Everyone has someone who cares 

about them and would love to hear 

from them (from afar — seriously, 

please stay at home). It would be 

foolish to expect our attempts at 

social interaction in quarantine 

to be as good or as valuable as the 

genuine sense of fulfillment that 

comes with getting to see your 

favorite people. It might as well be 

a law of physics that Chex Mix’s 

imitation puppy chow will never 

taste like my roommate’s, but I 

eat it nonetheless. I still go to my 

online classes, despite the lingering 

feeling of loss that is palpable 

among students who have ceased 

to see their friends, go to work or 

leave their houses. 

Do what you have to do. As one of 

my favorite professors once said in 

her newly-online office hours, “Be 

gentle with yourself.” Try to make 

new memories, good ones.

O

utside of the Louvre, 

a guard stands in 

front of the endless 

queue, 
controlling 
eager 

tourists 
and 
admitting 

them in an orderly fashion. 

Somewhere around noon, he 

will cut the queue and close 

the entrance, then tell that 

unfortunate traveler who was 

just cut, “Sorry, come back 

tomorrow.” These days, when 

no one can actually get into 

the Louvre, I feel like that 

unfortunate traveler. This is 

about when the entire country 

draws the line right in front of 

you.

Amid 
the 
crisis, 
I 
am 

living in the United States as 

an Asian and a foreigner. It 

would take an hour for me to 

explain how this situation has 

unleashed racist sentiment 

against 
Asian 
people, 
but 

there is another important 

aspect: How COVID-19 has 

forced me to recognize my 

position here in the U.S. At the 

White House press conference 

on 
March 
17, 
a 
reporter 

pointed out that President 

Donald Trump’s use of the 

term “Chinese Virus” is racist 

against Chinese Americans. It 

is not even worth discussing 

his remark, but the phrasing 

of the question itself was 

upsetting. She criticized him 

for being insensitive to the 

discrimination against “Asian 

Americans,” 
not 
Asians 

in 
general. 
Other 
media 

coverage also addresses this 

as an Asian American matter. 

At first, I wasn’t sure if I read 

them correctly. What about 

Asians in this country who 

are not Americans?

I have been living in the 

U.S. for almost two years as a 

“Korean Korean.” Observing 

American 
reactions 
to 

coronavirus-related 
racism, 

I felt like the queue was cut 

right in front of me. Even 

when 
being 
discriminated 

against, there is a priority to 

be recognized as a victim. If 

there was a queue to enter the 

category of victimhood, they 

let Asian Americans in, but not 

us. The most depressing part is 

that even the journalists and 

so-called liberals who claim 

to defend minorities against 

the current administration 

draw 
the 
line 
to 
first 

recognize “their people” as 

victims. 
Intersectionality 

creates 
different 
tiers 
of 

“minority-hood.” While Asian 

Americans 
are 
prioritized 

over Asian foreigners, racists 

attack both groups on the 

same basis. If we are not even 

recognized as victims, who 

will care about us?

The ugliest part of this 

intersectionality 
is 
that 

our 
nationality 
alienates 

us institutionally. In other 

words, if someone says “If 

you don’t like it, just go back 

to your own country,” I have 

nothing to say, unlike those 

who are “from here.” This 

devastating reality becomes 

even more apparent during 

hard times. Canada closed 

its border and decided to 

only let their citizens and 

permanent residents in. The 

University pushes all students 

to go home, but there is no 

guarantee that international 

students can return to the 

U.S. someday. What I see from 

this panic is the priority of 

inclusion. 

Of course, I am aware 

that 
U.S. 
citizens 
have 

always been entitled to more 

rights in the first place. For 

instance, 
in 
the 
Supreme 

Court 
case 
Kleindienst 
v. 

Mandel (1972), it is decided 

that foreign nationals are not 

entitled to the same degree 

of due process as citizens 

when entering the U.S. It 

is 
institutionally 
accepted 

that foreigners are not even 

second-class 
“citizens.” 

However, when it comes to 

a national emergency, aside 

from 
my 
value 
judgment 

of whether this is right or 

wrong, countries prioritize 

their 
citizens 
even 
more 

explicitly.

To 
clarify, 
what 
I 
am 

pointing 
out 
here 
is 
the 

priority of recognition, not 

the priority of privilege. I 

don’t expect the same degree 

of legal privilege with the 

people who have no other 

country than the U.S. that 

will protect them. I, too, 

have my own country that 

will take care of me as much 

as, or even more than, the 

U.S. does to its people. But 

by choosing to stay in Ann 

Arbor, I am denying myself 

that opportunity by my will. 

However, that doesn’t mean 

that I am willing to risk 

more than what I would have 

received in my country of 

origin. As long as I am living 

here, paying more than any 

domestic students would, as 

well as taxes, I want the same 

degree of respect as a member 

of this community. At least, 

I want the recognition as a 

victim who needs protection 

from racist attacks. Maybe 

my analogy to the Louvre was 

wrong: It is more like a queue 

rushing into a tornado shelter. 

This is a more serious and 

desperate situation, where no 

one should be left outside. So, 

don’t draw the line.

Don’t draw the line

T

his 
Letter 
to 
the 

Editor is written in 

response to a news 

article written by Angelina 

Brede titled “Students, faculty 

question 
spring, 
summer 

tuition costs, quality of remote 

learning.”

Though I understand the 

frustration with the University 

of Michigan’s refusal to reduce 

tuition costs for the spring and 

summer terms, I cannot agree 

with the sentiment entirely. 

Tuition is about so much more 

than paying to be on campus 

for classes and community.

First and foremost: Spring 

and 
summer 
terms 
are 

incredibly different from what 

occurred during this winter 

term. They are optional — 

nobody is expected to take 

courses during these terms. 

Additionally, they were moved 

online a month in advance 

of the courses starting. This 

gives instructors substantially 

more time to convert the 

courses 
than 
there 
was 

during this term, and thus, 

these courses should be of 

substantially higher quality 

in comparison. Beyond this, 

students 
are 
making 
an 

informed decision. We were 

told the classes would be 

remote far in advance. Unlike 

this term, nobody is being 

blindsided by this change.

Furthermore, 
though 

buildings are on lockdown, 

University 
resources 
are 

fighting to go remote for 

the benefit of students. I 

understand 
we’re 
losing 

the 
“campus 
experience” 

by not being in Ann Arbor, 

but we are not losing all of 

the resources of student and 

University 
organizations. 

The library has made an 

additional 
1150 
books 

free-to-read 
online. 
Many 

organizations, including The 

Daily, First Generation, LSA 

Opportunity Hub and LSA 

Honors, have offered online 

events for their members 

and/or the broader University 

community. 
Though 
these 

resources are compromised, 

it’s demeaning to erase the 

labor of countless people 

in complaints about losing 

the “campus experience” by 

insinuating that we have lost 

them entirely.

The 
University 
is 
more 

than 
its 
buildings. 
Spring 

and 
summer

Everyone has

cares about 
them and 
would love 
to hear from 

them.

It is institutionally 

accepted that 

foreigners are not 
even second-class 

“citizens.”


A camera looks out onto a dimly lit living 

room. The frame is slightly unlevel, tilted 

up toward the right. In the bottom corner, a 

candle flickers; its shadow dances over the 

comfortable white drapes at the end of the 

room. Deep piano music starts, and a woman 

walks into view. She’s dressed simply: just 

shorts and a tank top. She starts to lunge 

toward the left, but then the video quickly 

changes to a different woman. This time, 

we’re outside, and the new subject continues 

the lunge from the previous shot. The camera 

changes again, now to a kitchen, where two 

people stand on screen in complementary 

loungewear sets. They continue the previous 

movements until there’s another switch, and 

then another, and then another, and then 

back to the first one. The sequence continues, 

the music swells and the dance finishes.

This is Pacific Northwest Ballet’s “One 

Thousand Pieces,” a performance created 

by PNB’s first-ever resident choreographer 

Alejandro Cerrudo. It was set to open the 

day after social distancing orders disbarred 

performances in PNB’s native Seattle. Instead 

of giving up, however, the company filmed 

the work from their various quarantined 

locations.

In many ways, the collaged final product is 

amateur: an amalgam of blurred clips taken 

on phone cameras that don’t capture the right 

frame and can’t handle the harsh lighting 

of homes and apartments. Pieced together, 

though, the imperfections make it beautiful. 

The work is bewitchingly haunting — the 

setting is intimate, the dancing is personal 

and the title “One Thousand Pieces” all of 

a sudden seems to work too well to be an 

accident. 

This is not the only product of dancers 

in quarantine. On Instagram alone, New 

York City ballet posted a similar collage 

of Justin Peck’s “The Times Are Racing,” 

San Francisco Ballet published archived 

footage of previous performances and NYCB 

principal dancer Tiler Peck started teaching 

virtual ballet class six days a week. Every 

day, even every hour, new content floods the 

feeds of isolated ballet fans across the globe. 

These are big names in the ballet world. 

NYCB, SFB and PNB are part of a select group 

of elite ballet companies in the United States. 

Their performances often cost hundreds of 

dollars to see, and their dancers — especially 

the principals — are the closest one can get to 

celebrity in a world of pliés and pointe shoes.

Traditionally, 
the 
dance 
world 
is 

interwoven across a networked bubble of 

passionately competitive individuals. It’s 

a community known for secret-keeping 

and built on the sink-or-swim method of 

orientation. Outsider audience members only 

get to see the finished product. 

Social media has dissolved some of these 

boundaries in the past few years. The first 

wave of influencers pulled back curtains on 

a ballet dancer’s life off-stage and showed 

the world they were also people who laughed 

and cried and walked their dogs on their days 

off. Nevertheless, the divide between us and 

them — between stage and audience, in and 

out — remained strong. 

Now, we all seem to be an audience for the 

same horrific show. We’re sitting on couches 

and floors and beds and chairs as we watch 

a pandemic desecrate an artistic community 

wholly dependent on large crowds and public 

performances. Without the stage, companies 

and individual artists are left wondering how 

to stay relevant, not to mention ready-to-go 

when it’s time to rebuild. Last week, San 

Francisco Ballet posed a telling question on 

their Instagram story: What would you like 

us to show you? 

In a humbling equalizer of our own 

humanity, the ballet world thus faces a 

re-evaluation of who gets to see what, who 

takes class from whom and what defines the 

very essence of performance.

No one has answers. Everybody has 

questions. But, in a thrilling change of 

events, everyone is in control of where this 

goes next.

Take an offstage look at the onstage world of ballet

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW

Just days before his passing, Mac Miller 

begged Thundercat to appear on his Tiny 

Desk performance. The bassist initially 

refused, as the excursion would require him 

to take days off from his European tour. But he 

eventually took on the request and surprised 

Miller, and the pair 

performed 
songs 

from Miller’s album 

Swimming. “I could 

see that he wanted 

it to be something,” 

Thundercat told NPR 

in a recent interview. 

“He 
wanted 
to 

introduce people to 

how it works for him. 

(...) You know, I would 

do that for Mac.” The 

duo’s music video for 

single “What’s the 

Use?” was slated to 

film a few days later, but Miller died before the 

shoot. Thundercat talked to Mac Miller for the 

last time over the phone the night before and 

told Miller that he loved him. 

“What’s the Use?” never got its music 

video, but it lives on as a tribute to Mac in this 

new era for Thundercat. It’s not featured on 

Thundercat’s newest album It Is What It Is, but 

the album’s title hearkens back to “What’s the 

Use?” with “it is what it is, till it ain’t” being 

one of the track’s signature lines. Thundercat 

also repeats the title across different points in 

the album. In another ode to Mac, the groovy 

baseline on “What’s the Use?” immediately 

follows every live performance of the single 

“Black Qualls.” 

Executive producer Flying Lotus puts it 

simply on Twitter: “I decided to structure the 

album as a journal of where (Thundercat’s) 

been since ‘drunk.’” Following 2017’s Drunk, 

Thundercat has not only experienced the loss 

of a best friend, but a number of developments: 

of sobriety, love and friendship. 

The album is split into three acts that 

individually 
explore 
self-awareness, 
fun 

times and loss. The first part kicks off with a 

newly developed sense of awareness on “Lost 

In Space / Great Scott / 22-26.” Thundercat 

describes the tension of feeling alone while 

knowing he’s not really alone. He fixates on his 

breathing and pulse and questions where he 

is. The track is sparse: 

Ambient synths and 

twinkling chords float 

in 
the 
background 

like 
a 
glitching 

space 
machine. 
He 

concludes simply by 

saying he’s “lost in 

space” and must start 

the show, as the same 

instrumentals 
carry 

into 
“Interstellar 

Love.” 

“Interstellar Love” 

operates as a jazz-

infused 
sequel 
to 

“Lost in Space.” The track is more intricately 

developed than the opener, with the synths 

giving way to Thundercat’s signature bassline 

and Kamasi Washington’s climatic saxophone 

playing. Overall, a theme of ephemeral 

beauty and the desire to find love envelops 

this part of the album as Thundercat sings 

about “find(ing) someone to love.” This love 

is likely platonic, as follow-up track “I Love 

Louis Cole” is a dedication to Thundercat’s 

friendship with fellow musician Louis Cole 

and the good times they’ve had together. This 

opening section of the album is admittedly 

forgettable; it does a good job of setting the 

scene, but these three tracks seem to float 

alone, as the “space” theme is not revisited 

throughout the rest of the album. 

What the album lacks in its intro, it makes 

up for in its chaotic, lively second act. Standout 

track and single “Black Qualls” is a mellow but 

sonically complex, funkadelic centerpiece. 

Steve Lacy’s full, soulful vocals are a balanced 

contrast to Thundercat’s thin falsettos as 

the two harmonize across the track’s verses. 

Similarly, P-Funk legend Steve Arrington’s 

warbly, raspy vocals in the chorus add a 

classically trippy element to this piece. On a 

track that lyrically explores not giving into 

paranoia, Thundercat uncharacteristically 

slaps his bass, placing its percussion at the 

very center. “Black Qualls” ends seamlessly 

with a transition from bass to violin and 

vocals from Childish Gambino. The blithe, 

heightened energy is carried on throughout 

the rest of the tracks from this part of the 

album. Whereas “Miguel’s Happy Dance” 

functions similarly to “I Love Louis Cole” 

as a reference to musician and collaborator 

Miguel Atwood’s happiness in a newfound 

relationship, “How Sway” and “Funny Thing” 

are designed more for Thundercat’s versatility 

on the bass. The former is exactly what we’d 

expect from Thundercat but on stimulants, 

the chords progressing at incredible speed 

on loop. The latter, on the other hand, is 

more groovy, the bassline warbly and full 

with Thundercat’s falsetto high-pitched and 

melodious as he sings about wanting to forget 

his pains and party.

The album climaxes at comedic summit 

“Dragon Ball Durag.” The track is preceded 

by “Overseas,” a goofy skit about joining 

the mile high club with a guest appearance 

from Zack Fox. Whether or not it delivers 

the intended comedic effect is debatable, but 

it proves a sufficient precursor to the single 

“Dragon Ball Durag” with Fox’s declaration: 

“There appears to be a shiny black man in 

first class / Getting some sloppy-toppy / He’s 

got his chains on and a durag.” “Dragon Ball 

Durag” essentially aims to capture the energy 

of Thundercat’s Twitter with references to 

anime, video games and comic books. Simply 

put, the song is about Thundercat wanting his 

lover to accept him for who he is. He captures 

this with hilarious honesty, asking his girl 

“how do I look in my durag?” in between 

anime references and promises to make love. 

Other memorable lyrics include “Do you like 

my new whip? / Watch me go zoom zoom,” 

and “I might be covered in cat hair / But I still 

smell good.” Beyond its humor, “Dragon Ball 

Durag” earns its merit as a standout track for 

its lush instrumentals. The bass work here is 

some of the busiest and funkiest throughout 

the album; the keys are smooth and the sax 

embellishments add a nice jazzy element.
