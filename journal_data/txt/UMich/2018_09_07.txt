ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

On 
a 
predominantly 

white 
campus, 
University 

of Michigan’s multicultural 
student organizations often 
play an critical role in creating 
communities 
for 
minority 

students. This year, multiple 
student organizations made 
strides to create a more 
inclusive Welcome Week for 
their new peers.

Students groups such as 

Black 
Student 
Union, 
the 

African Student Association, 
the 
Caribbean 
Student 

Association, 
Arab 
Student 

Association 
and 
Assisting 

Latin@s 
to 
Maximize 

Achievement all held events 
during this year’s Welcome 
Week to welcome students 
back to campus. The Office of 
Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs 
assisted in a number of events 
as well. 

While this year’s enrollment 

report has yet to be released, 
underrepresented minorities 
make up 12.8 percent of the 
undergraduate student body, 

according to last fall’s figures.

The second annual Umoja 

Festival was one of the many 
events organized by the Black 
Welcome 
Week 
committee 

this year. “Umoja” is a Swahili 
word for unity, and the BSU, 
African Student Association 

and the Caribbean Student 
Association all planned the 
event. The festival, held on the 
Diag at the end of last week, 
served as a way to connect the

legislature 

voted today to adopt a measure 
that would raise the minimum 
wage to $12 an hour, eliminate 
the tipped minimum wage and 
allow workers one hour of paid 
sick leave for every 30 hours 
worked. 

The Michigan Senate voted to 

adopt the proposal Wednesday 
and the Michigan House followed 
suit Thursday. The decision to 
adopt means the issues will no

HOSPITAL

The University of Michigan 

Professional 
Nurse 
Council 

will begin voting on a possible 
work stoppage next week. The 
union, which represents nurses 
at 
Michigan 
Medicine, 
has 

been bargaining with hospital 
administrators since January. 
Their previous contract expired 
June 30 and a new agreement 
still has not been reached.

UMPNC 
is 
currently 

pursuing unfair labor practice 
charges against the University 
on the grounds that Michigan 
Medicine has broken a written 
commitment to maintain current 
nurse staffing levels. UMPNC 
has said securing fair staffing 
levels is one of their biggest 
priorities for the new contract. 
Thousands of nurses and their 
allies attended a rally held by 
UMPNC in July to advocate 
for safer staffing and a better 
contract.

UMPNC representatives were 

not available to comment before 

the time of publication, but Sara 
Wallenfang, associate executive 
director 
for 
professional 

and member relations at the 
Michigan Nurses Association, 
confirmed the union decided 
to hold a vote on the potential 
stoppage.

At the July meeting of the 

University’s Board of Regents, 
UMPNC 
vice 
chair 
Donna 

Carnahan 
emphasized 
the 

union’s desire to care for and 
protect patients above all else.

“We 
provide 
world-class 

nursing care,” Carnahan told 
the Regents. “The UMPNC’s 
bargaining concern is about 
patients and the care they 
receive… I no longer feel I can 
trust my lifelong employer. I fear 
the University is now prioritizing 
profits over patient safety.”

Michigan Medicine said in 

a statement Thursday many 
priority negotiation issues have 
already been solved through 
bargaining. They feel progress 
has been made in contract 
negotiations, and they strongly 
oppose a work stoppage.

Symposium highlights LGBTQ

Audience members felt event lacked ethnic and racial diversity, grad student involvement

A group of about 60 faculty, staff 

members and students attended 
a day-long symposium Thursday 
on LGBTQ inclusion in research 
at Rackham Graduate School. 
Speakers discussed the range of 
LGBTQ scholarship and research 
at the University of Michigan, 
though some attendants criticized 
a lack of diversity in programming.

Rob Stephenson, director of the 

Center for Sexuality and Health 

Disparities and a department chair 
in the School of Nursing, spoke 
about how his identity intersected 
with his research.

“Do I only have to do LGBT 

health or HIV (research) because 
I’m a gay man?” Stephenson said. 
“Is that all I’m allowed to do? No, 
that’s ridiculous. I’m a researcher, 
and I learn from my work with 
communities 
... 
your 
identity 

doesn’t determine what type of 
research you’re doing. It should 
not preclude you from doing any 
research. You know, we have many 
cisgender heterosexual faculty at 

the center who work on research 
on gay couples. People will say, 
‘Well, what do they know?’ 
They have fundamental skills 
in research, and they work with 
communities.”

Stephenson 
said 
leading 

by example was essential to 
mentoring younger researchers. 
He emphasized the importance 
of being an advocate and using his 
research to make a positive impact.

“I think we have an ethical 

responsibility 
as 
scientists 
to 

mentor the next generation, and 
I think it’s doubly impactful 

when you’re a sexual minority 
scientist to provide leadership and 
mentoring to other people,” he 
said.

Gesturing around the room, 

Stephenson added, “This right here 
is a huge mentorship opportunity.”

and Adolescent Gender Services

meeting, the board, led by 
University President Mark 
Schlissel, voted to increase 
student tuition rates for the 
third year in a row. In-state 
tuition 
increased 
by 
2.9 

percent and out-of-state rose 
by 3.9 percent. Since 2002, 
tuition revenue has increased 
by more than 135 percent. 

Compared to last year’s 

rates, tuition for Michigan 
residents went from $14,826 
to $15,262 and out-of-state 
student tuition went from 
$47,452 to $49,326.

The board voted 7-1 to 

approve the tuition hike. 
Regent Andrea Newman, R, 
was the only board member 
to oppose the hike. In the 
meeting, she said she voted 
against the motion in an 
effort 
to 
keep 
University 

costs affordable for students.

“I’ve 
said 
this 
before, 

and I feel this is the real 
opportunity to make this 
statement,” 
Newman 
said. 

“In the past 10 years, we’ve 
raised in-state tuition over 
30 percent for freshmen and 

sophomores — an average of 
3.3 percent per year — and 
more for juniors and seniors.”

Schlissel and the regents 

pointed to recent initiatives 
such as the Go Blue Guarantee 
— a full-tuition financial 
aid package for all in-state 
students whose families make 
less than $65,000 a year — as 
worthwhile 
affordability 

investments 
that 
require 

further funds to support. To 
counteract this tuition hike, 
this year’s budget included 
a 16.3 percent increase — 
about $28.9 million — in 
undergraduate financial aid 
funding.

This 2.9 percent tuition 

increase 
still 
puts 
the 

University below the state’s 
increase cap of 3.8 percent.

Room and board rates also 

increased by 3 percent — 
now between $296 and $400 
more — as part of the vote. A 
statement in the University 
Record from the regents said 
the additional funds from 
the increase will be used 
to improve residence hall 
facilities.

“This 
marks 
the 
ninth 

consecutive year of residence 
hall operating cost increasing 
by 1 percent or less,” the 

statement 
reads. 
“With 

eight residence halls still in 
need of major upgrades, the 
overall 3 percent increase 
will cover essential housing 
services 
while 
supporting 

future 
renovations 
and 

maintenance.”

Regents 
may 
move 

investment decisions out of 
public meeting agendas

University 
officials 
are 

currently 
considering 

removing 
voting 
on 

investment decisions from 
the regents meeting agendas, 
bringing previously public 
investment 
conversations 

behind closed doors.

According to a statement 

from the University, the board 
would vote to establish broad 
guidelines 
for 
investment 

decisions and then allow the 
previously public votes to be 
made by the investment office 
staff.

University 
spokesperson 

Rick Fitzgerald said in a press 
release the current protocol 
far more public compared to 
other institutions and is not 
necessary.

“U-M goes beyond what 

peer 
institutions 
consider 

necessary by presenting new 
investments to the Board 

of 
Regents 
in 
public 

session to be approved 
before the investments 
are executed,” Fitzgerald 
wrote. “A more common 
practice would be for 
the Board of Regents to 
annually 
approve 
the 

types of investments that 
are appropriate for U-M 
and what percentage of 
total 
investments 
are 

appropriate 
for 
each 

investment type.”

The 
decision 
came 

months after the Detroit 
Free Press published an 
investigation claiming the 
University had invested 
funds into the properties 
of large donors to the 
University, 
including 

Stephen 
Ross, 
Sandy 

Robertson and more.

After the Detroit Free 

Press 
report, 
student 

organizations 
such 
as 

Roosevelt 
Institute 

and College Democrats 
published public callsfor 
the 
University 
to 
be 

more transparent about 

investment 
practices. 
LSA 

senior 
Christopher 
Olson, 

an author of a resolution 
from 
Roosevelt, 
requested 

the 
University 
publicly 

characterize the nature of 
endowment funds and future 
investments.

“As students we have a 

vested interest in how the 
endowment is used to promote 
the educational excellence of 
this University,” Olson wrote. 
“Conflicts of interest with 
University endowment have 
the potential to reduce the 
returns of the endowment 
which in turn will reduce the 
money which could be used to 
reduce the cost of tuition.”

Judge rules in favor of 

Bias Response Team in First 
Amendment case

In May, a group of students 

backed by an advocacy group 
called Speech First sued the 
University 
for 
infringing 

on their First Amendment 
rights with the use of the 
Bias 
Response 
Team. 
A 

federal judge sided with the 
University in early August, 
denying 
Speech 
First’s 

motion to end use of the BRT.

The BRT, housed under 

the Dean of Students office, 
responds to students’ reports 
of bias incidents involving 
race, 
ethnicity, 
gender, 

sexuality, religion, age and 
other identities.

The lawsuit was the first 

of its kind nationally and 
alleged 
the 
University’s 

speech 
code 
was 
too 

broad and vague to punish 
students. As Judge Linda 
V. Parker stated, however, 
the BRT’s investigations do 
not constitute a significant 
threat to a student accused of 
perpetuating bias.

“Even 
if 
the 
record 

reflected that the BRT had 
criticized 
an 
individual’s 

speech, there would be no 
First Amendment violation 
‘in the absence of some actual 
or 
threatened 
imposition 

of governmental power or 
sanction,’” 
Parker’s 
ruling 

read.

The Department of Justice 

filed a statement in support of 
Speech First’s suit, accusing 
the University of censoring 
student speech.

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
(La Casa is) moving in a positive direction. We 

understand that there’s a lot of demands that can’t be 
solved in a certain timeframe. They require time, so I think 
we’ve been understanding on that end because (the

more immediate or easier to tackle.

REVIEW
From Page 1A

Every Friday, one Daily news staffer will give a behind the scenes 
look at one of this week’s stories. This week, Ford senior Riyah 
Basha contributed reporting to a story on multicutural welcome 
week events.

“I’ve been following most of these organizations for the last two years 
or so, and it’s been so inspiring to watch communities accomplish 
what they set out to do so many years ago. ALMA and SALAM both 
seemed to achieve great success in pipelining young students of 
color to the University, and Black Welcome Week sets the standard 
in bringing dozens of Black student organizations together. All three 
of these communities have been historically marginalized at the 
University. And so as a student of color myself, it’s important that 
younger generations are able to not just follow in the footsteps of 
previous classes, but achieve more, and push for better. It’s incredibly 
heartening to see these communities ensuring just that; drawing on 
their shared histories and empowering each other with love. Though 
I don’t hold the identities of these affinity organizations, I learn from 
them. I try to give their stories a platform. And I encourage our staff 
members (shoutout Catherine Nouhan for tying the story together!) to 
do the same.”

In response, administrators 

eliminated multiple portions of 
its speech code in an effort to 
“remove potential ambiguity,” 
as University President Mark 
Schlissel put it. Dictionary 
definitions of “bullying” and 
“harassment” were removed 

from the code.

“We’re changing the way 

we describe things, but we’re 
not changing the function of 
these groups,” Schlissel said in 
a June interview.

As 
students 
make 
their 

way back into classrooms this 
week, multiple departments 
and professors include clauses 
on free speech and dialogue in 
their syllabi.

“Now 
as 
interim 
dean, 

I plan to champion some 
fundamental values of a liberal 
arts and sciences education — 
citizenship, engagement, and 
true dialogue,” LSA interim 
dean Elizabeth Cole wrote in 
an email to students Thursday. 
“By 
dialogue 
I 
mean 
the 

ability to speak authentically 
about what you think and 
feel while also being able to 
hear, understand, and respect 
different perspectives.”

other and the campus.

Education senior Camyrea 

Barnes, 
BSU 
secretary, 

said Umoja and other Black 
Welcome 
Week 
events 
can 

be crucial programming for 
incoming students.

“The Black community, when 

I was a freshman, welcomed 
me,” she said. “And I wanted 
to do my job as a senior to 
welcome the Black community 
and welcome the freshmen 
into the community, to let 
them know that when things 
go down, when they deal with 
microaggressions, when they 
deal with bias incidents that 
happen to them, or just being 
a student here — that they 
know that they have the Black 
community here to lean on.”

Music, 
Theatre 
& 
Dance 

freshman Mattie Levy attended 
Umoja, 
and 
expressed 
her 

excitement 
about 
the 
SIBS 

mentorship program and the 

additional groups she plans on 
joining after Welcome Week.

“SIBS is support for incoming 

Black students,” Levy said. 
“You can sign up to be a big sib 
or a little sib. So for freshmen, 
I’m a little sib so you’ll get a 
mentor ... at the event, they gave 
us soul food, they had activities 
and they had a magic show. I’ll 
probably join the Black Student 
Union too. That community is 
going to help you, always have 
people there for you, always 
have somewhere to go, someone 
to call.”

Earlier 
in 
the 
month, 

Assisting Latin@s to Maximize 
Achievements 
held 
an 

additional student orientation 
for their student participants. 
The orientation was a four-
day program through which 
incoming students were given 
introductions to faculty and 
given resources that promote 
their academic, cultural and 
emotional wellbeing. 

Last fall, ALMA participants 

painted messages of Latinx 
identity and pride on the Rock, 

only to find racist graffiti 
plastered 
over 
the 
popular 

student landmark. Community 
members repainted the Rock 
in solidarity the next day, 
and 
students 
began 
more 

concereted efforts to organize.

“A 
year 
later 
and 
the 

momentum is still growing,” 
Ford senior Yvonne Navarrete, 

former La Casa lead director, 
wrote in a Facebook post this 
week. “The Latinx community 
bounced back and hasn’t looked 
back.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Ronnie 

Alvarez, 
head 
of 
ALMA, 

shared his excitement about 
the turnout and meaningful 
relationships built during the 
orientation.

“I was very surprised that 

the 
participants 
were 
able 

to 
create 
very 
meaningful 

relationships 
despite 
the 

large group and limited time,” 
Alvarez said. “They also have 
expressed that they feel a lot 
more aware of the resources 
that are available to them at the 
University. ALMA is important 
for this campus because it 
helps 
students 
transition 

into a space where they are 
largely 
underrepresented. 

ALMA 
participants 
become 

empowered 
through 
the 

workshops 
centered 
around 

their identities and also become 
much 
more 
aware 
of 
the 

resources that the University 

has to help them succeed.”

The Office of Multi-Ethnic 

Student Affairs and the Arab 
Student 
Association 
also 

hosted an event called SALAM 
— Successful Arab Leaders at 
Michigan. SALAM is a two-
day program that aims to 
introduce 
incoming 
Arab 

students to campus resources, 
support networks and the Arab 
community. They met with 
current students and faculty, 
and as LSA freshman Hilal 
Bazzi recounted, the event 
was important for her social 
acceptance on campus.

“Coming from Dearborn, we 

have one of the largest Arab and 
Muslim 
populations,” 
Bazzi 

said. “Coming to the University 
of Michigan — it’s a much more 
diverse population ethnically, 
racially, 
and 
religiously. 
I 

thought it was very important to 
stay true to who you are and be 
able to connect with others like 
yourself on campus. So finding 
this 
community, 
connecting 

with 
this 
community, 
and 

educating others about your 

culture and identity I think is 
so important.”

Public Health junior Nour 

Eidy, SALAM’s co-organizer, 
said she believes there are 
more steps to be taken when 
planning 
multicultural 

events. She thinks programs 
like SALAM are especially 
meaningful when building the 
social and emotional wellbeing 
of incoming students. 

“I know that we’ve done 

programs like Arab and Latinx 
Wolverine Day where we’re 
trying to show new admitted 
students all the community has 
to offer, but we really wanted 
there to be a follow up to that,” 
Eidy said. “Now you’re here, 
what now? Your journey has 
begun, where’s the community 
at, where’s that family aspect 
we were talking about? There’s 
such value in peer mentorship 
and when it’s organic, when 
you have shared identities and 
similar identities it’s this whole 
new level of comfort and trust 
that’s built up.”

medical services and support 
and conducts research focused 
on children and adolescents who 
identify as trans.

“We are a young clinic,” Selkie 

said. “It’s a steep learning curve, 
I would say … At this point, very 
little that we do has any evidence 
behind it, which is frustrating 
clinically but exciting from a 
research perspective.”

Selkie said the clinic seeks 

out input from patients and their 
parents when considering and 
conducting research.

“When you’re doing research 

with a sensitive, marginalized 
population, 
you 
really 
need 

their input in how you are going 

to conduct the research and 
what your priorities are even 
going to be,” she said. “I think 
that in pediatric research that’s 
interesting because our specialty 
by nature is a paternalistic 
specialty because our patients are 
literally children, and so I think 
that we often ask for parents’ 
input, but we serve so many 
adolescents that it behooves us to 
involve the youth in our research.”

At the end of the symposium, 

Associate Prof. Lawrence La 
Fountain-Stokes, 
director 
of 

Latina/o Studies, criticized the 
lack of ethnic and racial diversity 
among the speakers.

“That should be addressed 

very specifically, perhaps taking 
advantage of the Institute for 
Research on Women and Gender 
and their programs,” La Fountain-
Stokes said during a question-and-

answer session at the end of the 
event. “Also, graduate students 
have been noting how they didn’t 
know about it and were not able 
to present, so in moving forward, 
it seems like it would be ideal to 
have more spaces for graduates to 
present.”

Public Health student Hyuri 

McDowell agreed the symposium 
would 
benefit 
from 
more 

diversity, saying more inclusion— 
as well as increased involvement 
from graduate students— would 
have augmented the perspectives 
offered at the event. McDowell 
also said it was important to 
discuss 
the 
intersection 
of 

research and LGBTQ identity.

“The 
intersection 
between 

those two is very important 
because no one has just one 
identity,” he said. “I think those 
two things have to work together.”

“Nurses are critical to the 

delivery of safe patient care,” 
the statement reads. “The most 
critically ill patients in the state 
come to Michigan Medicine. If 
any of our nurses go out on strike, 
their absences will put patient 
safety at serious risk.”

Striking is technically illegal 

for public employees. According to 
Michigan Medicine’s statement, 
employees will not be paid for 
time out on strike.

In a bargaining session between 

UMPNC and Michigan Medicine 
administrators Wednesday, the 
hospital offered a revised package 
proposal to union representatives. 
According to an email sent to 
nurses by Michigan Medicine 
president 
David 
Spahlinger 

and shared with The Daily by a 
Michigan Medicine spokesperson, 
the package includes 3 to 4 
percent pay increases across the 
board over the next three years. 
The package also offers increases 
in shift differential, weekend and 
on-call pay, as well as limits on 
mandatory overtime and tuition 
reimbursement 
for 
graduate 

nursing programs.

on the ballot, warning that 
Republican representatives will 
only dismantle them in a process 
known as “adopt-and-amend.” 
Though no Republicans voiced 
support for any of the policies 
during debate, State Sen. Patrick 
Colbeck, R-Canton, was one of 
three Republicans who voted 
against adopting the proposals, 
saying 
adopt-to-amend 
is 
a 

“procedural gimmick.”

“That’s not how we should be 

doing things,” Colbeck told The 
Detroit News. “We should be 
debating the merits.”

Public Policy junior Katie 

Kelly, communications director 
of the University of Michigan’s 
chapter of College Democrats, 
expressed 
similar 
concerns. 

Though she supports the policies, 
she worries about Republican 
legislators gutting the initiatives 
in their lame-duck session later 
this year.

“The voters should be the 

ones to pass these initiatives, 
not those who do not have the 
public’s best interests at heart,” 
Kelly said. “This is simply a 
ploy by the Republicans to take 
this initiative off the ballot and 
amend the laws after the election 
to suit their own interests.”

Republican legislators have 

not made any comment on 
whether or not they intend 
to amend the proposals, but 
Michigan House Speaker Tom 
Leonard, R-DeWitt, said the 
legislature needs to have a say in 
what is in them.

“Both 
of 
these 
citizens-

initiated 
laws 
were 
poorly 

written,” Leonard said, according 
to The Detroit News.

Some Democratic legislators 

voted against the proposals to 
avoid the “adopt-and-amend” 
procedure, even though they 
agreed 
with 
the 
policies 

themselves. State Sen. Curtis 
Hertel, D-East Lansing, said the 
adoption outcome was “a trick on 
the voters of Michigan, an attack 
on democracy,” according to The 
Detroit News.

If the proposals are not 

amended, the Michigan One 
Fair Wage initiative would raise 
Michigan’s 
minimum 
wage 

to $12 an hour by 2022 and 
include tipped workers by 2024. 
Currently, a “tip credit” allows 
employers to pay workers who 
are tipped as low as $3.38 an 
hour.

Tips are expected to make up 

the difference between the $3.38 
wage and the minimum wage 
for workers who aren’t tipped, 
which is $9.25 an hour. The Fair 
Labor Standards Act requires 
employers make up any other 

differences, but enforcement is 
said to be so relaxed, the One Fair 
Wage website calls wage theft an 
“epidemic.”

Allowing tipped workers to 

earn full minimum wage would 
have huge effects on women and 
people of color. Studies from 
Cornell University have shown 
that Black workers earn less 
than white counterparts, and 
perceived attractiveness plays a 
large role in how much women 
get tipped. More than 7 in 10 
tipped workers in Michigan are 
women, and the poverty rate 
among women who work for tips 
is 20.8 percent. The poverty rate 
for women of color who work for 
tips is 27.1 percent.

The 
Michigan 
Restaurant 

Association frequently opposes 
minimum wage increases and 
paid sick leave, and said the 
proposal will increase costs by 
241 percent and eliminate 14,000 
restaurant jobs in the state. The 
MRA also argues employees 
like the tipping credit system –– 
according to Upserve, 97 percent 
of servers prefer the tip credit 
system.

If the proposal becomes law, 

Michigan would become the 
eighth state to not use a tip credit.

The University’s chapter of 

College Republicans did not 
respond immediately to requests 
for comment.

P

apa John’s has received 
significant 
media 
attention in the past 
couple of months, largely due 
to their outspoken leader, 
John 
Schnatter. 
Schnatter 
made headlines in December 
2017 
after 
he 
criticized 
the NFL’s handling of the 
national anthem protests. He 
infamously termed the whole 
affair a “debacle,” ignoring 
the purpose of the protests 
— 
which 
were 
intended 
to 
call 
attention 
to 
the 
disgraceful policing practices 
throughout African-American 
communities. 
Investors 
and consumers reacted to 
his 
remarks: 
Papa 
John’s 
shares fell 11 percent and 
sales dropped an estimated 
5 
percent 
in 
the 
weeks 
afterward. Schnatter, feeling 
the pressure, stepped down as 
CEO but retained his position 
as chairman of the board.
Schnatter made headlines 
again in July 2018 when the 
media reported on his use 
of the N-word, along with 
other controversial remarks, 
during 
a 
conference 
call 
with an external marketing 
firm. During the call, he 
claimed he wasn’t a racist 
but ended up using the racial 
slur, “explaining that KFC 
founder Colonel Sanders used 
that word, but Papa John’s 
didn’t.” 
Schnatter 
resigned 
as chairman the day after the 
story broke, but he has been 
fighting the board to try and 
come back ever since. In July, 
the company’s sales suffered 
a 10.5 percent decline in its 
North American market. 
Along with covering his 
use of the N-word, Forbes 
released “The Inside Story of 
Papa John’s Toxic Culture” 
by 
reporter 
Noah 
Kirsch. 
The 
piece 
shed 
light 
on 
the 
problematic 
culture 
found at Papa John’s and at 
organizations across the globe. 
Kirsch wrote about the “bro 
culture” that was pervasive 
at 
the 
company. 
Female 
employees were mocked and 
asked time and time again if 
they were menstruating. Male 
executives 
made 
repulsive 
references 
to 
“gangbangs” 
and comments about whether 
women wanted “to jump on 
the train.” Employees at the 

firm explained that it was 
Schnatter’s close circle of male 
executives that perpetuated 
this despicable culture.
Forbes’s 
coverage 
of 
Papa John’s is of particular 
importance for two reasons. 
First, it’s clear that racism 
and 
racial 
insensitivity 
is 
alive and well even in the 
21st 
century. 
People 
can 
choose to believe that racism 
is a thing of the past, but 
Schnatter’s remarks — at least 
in my mind — demonstrate 
the unwillingness of certain 
individuals 
to 
realize 
the social impact of their 
ignorance. Second, the culture 
that 
permeates 
through 
Papa John’s likely permeates 
through 
scores 
of 
other 
organizations. The degrading 
and 
disrespectful 
remarks, 
which 
contributed 
to 
the 
“bro culture” at Papa John’s, 

can certainly be overheard at 
other organizations.
You can say that one man 
doesn’t speak for an entire 
organization – that Schnatter’s 
remarks shouldn’t define the 
abstract entity that is Papa 
John’s – but I would disagree. 
Leaders — especially leaders 
of multinational corporations 
with thousands of employees 
and millions of consumers — 
must recognize the impact 
they have on how individuals 
think and act. Instead of 
perpetuating 
arrogance, 
ignorance 
and 
dominance, 
leaders like Schnatter should 
use their global platforms to 
encourage more positive and 
constructive values.
The 
#MeToo 
movement 
has played an important role 
throughout the coverage of 
cultural failings at not only 

Papa John’s but also several 
notable 
organizations. 
Earlier this year, The New 
York Times published a piece 
about the firing of several 
male 
executives 
at 
Nike 
after women revolted over 
the company’s inhospitable 
culture. The authors discussed 
the 
company’s 
culture 
by 
mentioning that staff outings 
often ended at strip clubs and 
bosses were reported to have 
“referenced a staff member’s 
breasts in an email.”
Nike’s corporate culture 
may not have been much 
different than Papa John’s, 
but leaders at each respective 
organization could not have 
acted 
more 
differently. 
Leaders at Nike decided to 
act and reform themselves 
internally 
before 
the 
bad 
publicity hurt its bottom line. 
The company has even been 
able to maintain stable stock 
price growth since The New 
York Times first published the 
piece in April.
Nike should serve as an 
example 
for 
organizations 
everywhere on how to react 
to 
the 
increasing 
social 
awareness and consciousness 
in 
our 
current 
society. 
Gloria Feldt, co-founder and 
president of Take the Lead, 
wrote an incredible piece in 
Time 
magazine 
about 
how 
organizations should respond 
to the #MeToo movement. She 
writes, “…leaders will have 
to create work environments 
where women aren’t objectified 
and where implicit bias is at 
least recognized and at best 
eliminated 
from 
recruiting, 
hiring and retention practices.”
I hope the coverage of 
Papa John’s, along with the 
ongoing 
coverage 
of 
the 
#MeToo movement, will cause 
more 
companies 
to 
reform 
themselves. I hope this serves as 
a warning sign to organizations 
across the globe that racial 
insensitivity and “bro culture” 
are not sustainable principles 
to maintain in our current 
society. Leaders can choose 
to do the right thing — while 
avoiding embarrassment — by 
reforming themselves and their 
organization’s culture.

SAM KOLE | OP-ED

To the disillusioned student
A

t a time in history when 
every 
political 
norm 
has been upended and 
replaced with partisanship and 
personal attacks, we remember 
the American hero, Sen. John 
McCain, R–Arizona. McCain, 
a selfless public servant for six 
decades, had an unwavering 
optimism 
in 
our 
political 
system and its ability to do good 
work for the American people. 
McCain was regarded as “the 
maverick of the Senate” for his 
uncommon courage to defy 
party lines and vote with his 
conscience. McCain will forever 
be remembered for his shocking 
Senate vote against the repeal of 
the Affordable Care Act, which 
McCain opposed on principle 
but voted to keep in place for 
the good of the country over the 
good of his party.
Respected by many, McCain 
rose above ad hominem attacks 
to focus on the issues important 
to the people of Arizona and the 
rest of the country. His style and 
class are of a bygone era when 
issues of policy and substance 
dominated 
headlines. 
John 
McCain’s patriotic spirit is what 
must be reignited on college 
campuses across the country.
Optimism in our system has 
fallen out of favor. Academia’s 
harsh criticism of politicians 
and the U.S. government over the 
past two decades has forestalled 
our generation’s optimism that 
through our democracy we 
can effect change in pursuit 
of a more perfect union. Look 
across historically politically-
active campuses and notice the 
frightening lack of patriotism 
or belief in the government 
as a positive agent of change. 
The 
student 
movements 
of 
Berkeley and Ann Arbor in the 
’60s have been replaced with 

hashtags 
and 
social 
media 
“like activism.” Students have 
John McCain to look to as an 
example of how a dedicated 
civil servant and politician can 
move our democracy forward. 
Change takes decades to enact: 
We need to be proactive in 
pushing advocacy and strive 
toward making our campuses 
and communities better places 
to live and study.
Our 2017 campus protests 
against 
the 
administration’s 
policies and directives were 
merely reactive. As students, 
we need to be proactive in 
our approach and continue to 
participate all year long, rather 
than just when it is popular or 
trending to do so.
The 
next 
generation 
of 
American taxpayers has become 
jaded and bored by our political 
system. Too often, we forget 
that those on the other side 
of the debate are also patriots 
interested in what’s best for our 
country. As students, we ought 
to recognize the humanity of 
our opponents and respect their 
positions. As former President 
George W. Bush said in his 
eulogy for McCain: “He was 
honorable, always recognizing 
his opponents were still patriots 
and human beings. He loved 
freedom with a passion of a 
man who knew its absence. He 
respected the dignity inherent 
in every life.” Even in the most 
fraught 
of 
circumstances, 
McCain never gave into the 
personal 
attacks 
that 
have 
come to dominate presidential 
politics. Instead, he embodied 
decency in his respect for his 
opponents and continued to 
debate the issues of the day.
In his farewell statement, 
McCain articulated this best: 
“We are three-hundred-and-

twenty-five million opinionated, 
vociferous 
individuals. 
We 
argue 
and 
compete 
and 
sometimes even vilify each other 
in our raucous public debates. 
But we have always had so much 
more in common with each 
other than in disagreement. 
If only we remember that and 
give each other the benefit of 
the presumption that we all love 
our country we will get through 
these challenging times. We will 
come through them stronger 
than before. We always do.”
The spirit of John McCain 
survives through the voices of 
campus activists who speak 
up for the policies they believe 
in and then turn out to vote 
those policies into law. Engage, 
lean in, turn on and activate 
yourself to become a force for 
good and an impetus for change 
and reform. We do this not 
because it is easy or convenient 
but because it is our duty as 
an 
engaged 
citizenry. 
Our 
democratic system requires us 
to show up to vote instead of 
dismissing the effectiveness of 
one vote, as this lazy response 
is reserved for the uninterested. 
The “like activism” politics of 
today is mere virtue signaling 
intended for social media sites 
and is not enough. Hashtags do 
not effect change. Liking posts 
is not enough.
Take responsibility for the 
campus, community, state and 
country you live in. Former 
President 
Barack 
Obama 
addressed 
audiences 
at 
the 
DNC admonishing the nation, 
saying, “Democracy is not a 
spectator sport.” We owe it to 
ourselves and to our future to 
get informed and get involved.

Takeaways from the recent Papa John’s disaster

ERIK NESLER | COLUMN

It’s time for new Democratic leadership

MARGOT LIBERTINI | COLUMN

I

t’s been two years of 
soul-searching 
and 
restructuring 
for 
the 
Democrats 
since 
the 
2016 
election 
when 
Republicans 
won the presidency, 
the 
House 
of 
Representatives and 
the 
Senate. 
Now, 
it is time to enact 
the 
strategy 
they 
have 
formulated 
throughout 
these 
past two years in 
order to try and 
win the House and Senate 
back 
in 
November. 
Thus 
far, this strategy has been 
to largely focus messaging 
on the economy, as it is a 
salient and relatable issue. 
Economic inequality is rising, 
causing 
major 
resentment 
and unease. The Democrats 
are certainly the major party 
that is more likely to address 
this inequality, as they have 
a 
stronger 
background 
of 
enacting such policy.
In a perfect world, that 
would be all that matters. 
Democrats have the better 
policy 
for 
the 
issues 
of 
today, and thus, they should 
be 
elected. 
However, 
the 
messaging is not always so 
easy. In fact, much of the 
messaging has nothing to do 
with the economy, or policy 
at all, because our era is 
so insanely polarized that 
all of that takes a back seat 
to partisan politics. What 
rallies Republicans together 
more than anything? Shared 
disdain 
for 
Democratic 
leadership, 
namely 
Rep. 
Nancy 
Pelosi, 
D–Calif, 
the minority leader in the 
House. More than a third 
of 
Republican 
attack 
ads 
are focused on Pelosi, and 
she is a major aspect of the 
Republican 
strategy 
for 
keeping control of the House 
in November. The ads link 
Democratic House candidates 
to Pelosi and then attempt 
to link Pelosi to a host of 
ridiculous accusations, such 
as secretly being in support 
of 
MS-13. 
Unfortunately, 
this strategy is influential, 
and Democrats are not in a 
position to take any risks in 
this election. Thus, I would 
encourage Pelosi to remove fuel 
from the fire and step down 
before November midterms.
Further, many Democrats 
aren’t particularly enthused 

about 
the 
leader, 
either. 
This is especially true of 
Democrats in swing states, 
such as Ohio and 
Pennsylvania, 
because 
the 
moderate vote is so 
important, and the 
anti-establishment 
message 
is 
loud. 
Notably, these are 
states that Donald 
Trump 
won 
in 
2016, 
and 
they 
are 
important 
to 
potentially 
flip 
the House. The connection 
to Pelosi appears toxic for 
those in tight races. Some 
candidates have gone so far as 
to say they will not vote for her 
if elected, while others simply 
speak vaguely of new leadership.

Clearly, 
she 
is 
not 
presently a popular political 
figure — but why? Of course, 
some of it is pure Republican 
strategizing. 
Their 
party 
is 
split 
between 
Trump’s 
nationalist 
populism 
and 
the more traditional fiscal 
conservatism — two economic 
visions that are quite at odds. 
Thus, rather than bridge that 
divide through seeking middle 
ground candidates or smart 
policy, they have decided to 
unite through use of a common 
enemy found in Pelosi. But 
why is her own party turning 
on her? Of course, a good 
portion of the animosity is 
both ageist and misogynistic. 
She’s a 78-year-old woman, 
and thus people believe her 
time has passed. We rarely 
hear that a man is getting 
too old for the job, so this 
aspect of the Pelosi problem 
is unfortunate and unfair.
However, it is not entirely 
about 
her 
age 
or 
gender. 
Nancy Pelosi has been the 
House Democratic leader for 
16 years, including during 

the 2010 elections, when the 
Democrats 
lost 
63 
House 
seats — a loss the party has 
yet to recover from. From that 
perspective, it does not seem 
that she has been particularly 
effective in rallying voters. 
The Democratic Party lost 
the past four House elections, 
even 
as 
they 
won 
the 
presidency in 2012 with the 
re-election of then-President 
Barack Obama. Furthermore, 
after serving as leader for 
so long, Pelosi truly is the 
establishment. 
She 
has 
consistently rejected a turn 
toward left-wing economics, 
even as the party has shown 
an enthusiasm for it through 
the popularity of Sen. Bernie 
Sanders, D–Vt., in 2016 and 
the recent primary elections 
of 
progressive 
candidates 
such as Alexandria Ocasio-
Cortez. 
These 
reasons 
support the notion that she 
should 
step 
down 
before 
November 
in 
order 
to 
reinvigorate Democrats and 
cut off a core Republican 
strategy.
With 
fresh 
messaging 
should 
come 
fresh 
faces. 
This 
cannot 
be 
the 
Democratic Party of 2016 
unless we want to lose like 
the 
Democratic 
Party 
of 
2016. We need to update 
our leadership to represent 
the party of economic and 
social justice for the whole 
country. 
Rep. 
Tim 
Ryan, 
D–Ohio, challenged Pelosi 
after the 2016 election, and 
he has indicated he might 
do so again. Having party 
leadership from a Rust Belt 
state rather than California 
or New York would be a 
refreshing 
and 
welcome 
change for the party.
Above all else, we need 
party leadership that can 
ensure a win in November. 
Between separating families, 
continuing corporate tax cuts, 
defending our adversaries, 
the state of the Democratic 
Party and the country as a 
whole is incredibly dire. The 
Republicans are using Pelosi 
as a way to fire up their 
voters, and there is too much 
at stake to lose any votes. 
Hopefully, Pelosi will step 
down and allow room for 
another Democrat to rise and 
carry this party forward.

bum bum. Bum. Bum bum bum. 
Bum.

What do you think of when 

you read this line? The State Farm 
jingle? Red Robin? It’s really just 
gibberish, but to me, this series of 
“bums” is the thumping beginning 
of The Beach Boys’ innovative 
classic “Good Vibrations.” The 
electric bass carries that song 
through all of its crazy twists and 
turns right from the beginning. 
This is true to much of American 
pop music, and although the bass 
may be hidden under other rhythm 
parts, it is instrumental to the 
groove of a genuine hit. Imagine 
“Good Vibrations” without bass, 
or the “M.A.S.H.” theme, or Ike 
and Tina Turner’s “River Deep, 
Mountain High” or Nancy Sinatra’s 
“These Boots Are Made for 
Walkin’”— it’s nearly impossible. 
The women behind all of these 
songs fell into bass as an accident, 
but made a permanent mark on 
American 
pop 
music 
forever. 

Without Carol Kaye, those iconic 
lines and many, many more simply 
wouldn’t exist.

Though 
she 
is 
relatively 

unknown to people outside of 
music, Kaye is arguably one of, 
if not the most prolific studio 
musician in pop history. She boasts 
an estimated 10,000 studio credits 
on both guitar and bass, and her 
professional career lasted almost 
half a century. Now a grandmother 
settled in Antelope Valley, Calif., 
Kaye is not who you expect to be 
nearly the most recorded bassist 
of the last five decades. A petite 
blonde without frills, the musician 
is frank and straightforward in 
interviews. She wears sunglasses 
inside, 
and 
always 
has. 
She 

doesn’t use a decked-out, custom 
instrument, and instead plays a 
Fender Precision Bass, with a pick. 
In fact, Kaye didn’t even start out as 
a bassist, but rather a jazz guitarist, 
giving lessons and playing in clubs 
to make cash for her mother at 14 
years old.

I was almost embarrassed to 

find out about Carol Kaye for the 
first time a few months ago. I mean, 
how can someone so incredibly 
prolific 
and 
instrumental 
to 

popular music fly so under the 
radar? But that’s the beauty of her 
talent — she was never in the studio 
for the fame, sex, rock ‘n’ roll and 
least of all, drugs. Instead, it was for 
a steady paycheck to feed her three 
children and mother at home. Her 
genius did not lie in charisma, but 
pure inventiveness. At 13, Kaye’s 
mother bought her a steel-string 
guitar and she began taking lessons 
on her own dime, taking odd jobs to 
gain extra income and support her 
single parent. Her teacher saw a 
special talent in the young girl, and 
soon, Kaye was playing jazz gigs in 
Los Angeles nightclubs.

But she had a baby at 16, and 

had to keep up several day jobs to 
support her family. In 1957, Kaye 
was playing guitar at the Beverly 
Cavern in Hollywood when a 
producer asked for someone to 
play on Sam Cooke’s arrangement 
of “Summertime.” Going from live 
work to studio session playing, 
called “record dates” at the time, 
was a big decision — often, jazz 
musicians never returned from 
the studio in those days. Kaye had 
mouths to feed, though, so she 
took the job, and soon she was in 
demand. By then, she had married 
and had another child, so the 
meager sums of club life would not 
cut it. In the studio, she found a crew 
of similar musicians that had made 
the transition from jazz to the pop 
and rock hits of the time. Though it 
may have seemed like the Monkees 
and groups like them were playing 
their own instruments on each hit 
record, it was likely Kaye and her 
contemporaries, skillfully boiling 
down years of jazz performance 
into the catchy notes of a pop hook. 
In an interview with For Bass 
Players Only, she claims she never 
felt alienated as the only woman 
in the studio during most of her 
career, but Kaye was trailblazing 
a path for other female musicians 
with every move she made.

One fateful day in 1963, the 

electric 
bassist 
on 
a 
Capitol 

Records studio date didn’t show up, 
and Kaye was called in to replace 
him. She had done some bass guitar 
work on hits like “The In Crowd” 
by Dobie Gray, but was by and far a 
guitarist first before that moment. 
The second she laid her hands on 
a Fender P-Bass for the first time, 
music history changed. It may 
sound like hyperbole, but it’s the 

truth — Kaye soon rose to “first 
call” status as a session bassist and 
worked for days on end, sometimes 
sleeping on her instrument case 
in between takes. She was the 
rhythm behind much of The Beach 
Boys’ legendary 1966 album Pet 
Sounds, and both Brian Wilson 
and Quincy Jones have called her 
the greatest electric bassist of all 
time. Paul McCartney has even 
said that Kaye’s work influenced 
his contributions to The Beatles’ 
classic record Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely 
Hearts Club. Her talent was pure, 
unabashed and obvious to anyone 
who heard it. Her lines weren’t 
too complicated or basic or poppy 
or rock ‘n’ roll, but rather perfect 
elaborations on the simple rhythms 
put in front of her. She created 
a smooth and precise sound so 
famous that producers would ask 
other bassists to replicate on the 
rare occasion she couldn’t make 
it to a date. Most of all, Kaye was 
a master of the groove, following 
whatever her training and hands 
told her to do.

In addition to her musical 

talent, Kaye was always a staunch 
advocate for herself and her ideas. 
Without this, she would have never 
left two unhappy marriages, hired 
a live-in nanny and provided for 
her entire family on her own for 
years. Her genius both allowed 
her to pave her own path in music 
history 
and 
be 
self-sufficient 

enough to prove any critic wrong 
about a woman’s place in the studio. 
Even beyond her years as a session 
musician, the bassist published 
instructional books to teach the 
next generation of players. She still 
gives lessons via Skype at the age of 
83. Kaye would not deem herself a 
feminist hero, and neither would I 
— that’s never what she wanted to 
represent, and never set out to be 
anything other than a guitar player. 
But she certainly is a hero of some 
sort, especially to women in music. 
Such a prolific career on such iconic 
albums and with such legendary 
bands is an accomplishment that 
can’t even be fully understood 
by anyone but her. That number, 
10,000 songs, is almost impossible 
to truly fathom, but for Kaye, it’s the 
reality of her life’s purpose. Anyone 
who has listened to the radio since 
1958 has heard her play at one time 
or another, and I hope that one day 
they know her name.

SINGLE REVIEW: “SUSPIRIUM” 

Yesterday, 
Thom 
Yorke 

released a solo track entitled 
“Suspirium.” The song is a 
creepy pastoral waltz off of 
the score Thom Yorke has 
composed for the upcoming 
horror film “Suspiria.” The 
instrumentation is minimal, 
limited to just piano and 
flute (what sounds like a 
harpsichord 
mirrors 
the 

piano). The work straddles 
the 
line 
between 
angelic 

and 
vaguely 
unsettling; 

the 
bittersweet 
quality 

is 
attributable 
to 
Yorke’s 

eldritch 
voice 
and 
what 

sounds like the heavy use 
of 
major/minor 
modality 

(a 
compositional 
gambit 

Radiohead 
is 
particularly 

fond 
of), 
which 
has 
the 

rhetorical effect of imparting 
a sense of instability. The 
cryptic lyrics contribute to 

this feeling of uncertainty as 
well, with lines such as “All 
is well, as long as we keep 
spinning / Here and now, 
dancing behind a wall / When 
the old songs and laughter we 
do / Are forgiven always and 
never been true” sounding 
like some Delphic prophecy.

While most of Yorke’s solo 

work is distinguishable from 
the 
music 
of 
Radiohead, 

“Suspirium” 
could 
easily 

be mistaken for a outtake 
from A Moon Shaped Pool, 
or a companion piece to 
“Like 
Spinning 
Plates.” 

Yorke’s 
ability 
to 
create 

such a beautiful effect while 
retaining simplicity of both 
orchestration and harmony 
is a testament to his prescient 
songwriting 
abilities. 
The 

piece is gorgeous, a simple 
composition 
tinged 
with 

complex 
implications 
of 

sadness and confusion. While 
I haven’t seen the movie this 
song was made for, “Suspiria” 
is already fighting an uphill 
battle if they want to live up 
to the score.

GENDER & MEDIA COLUMN

‘The Innocents’ clumsily 
executes a clever premise

Confused, 
angry 
and 

lovestruck 
teenagers 
running 

away from the oppressed tyranny 
of their homes is a tried and 
tested formula that even Netflix 
has jumped upon recently. The 
streaming service’s newest show, 
“The Innocents,” however, is one 
of their less impressive efforts. 
Just as Netflix’s “The End of 
the Fu***ng World” channeled 
the whimsy and irreverence of 
“Pierrot Le Fou,” “The Innocents” 
evokes the more cliché aspects of 
young adult dramas.

“The Innocents” deals with 

the bizarre and the supernatural 
by chronicling the love story 
of 
teenagers 
June 
(Sorcha 

Groundsell, “Clique”) and Harry 
(Percelle 
Ascott, 
“Doctors”). 

Both are rather well-adjusted 
compared to most stereotypical 
TV teenagers. While they do 
explore their own fears and 
anxieties, the show portrays them 
as doing so with a more realistic 
sense of tact and maturity than 
expected of teenagers. June, who 
lives with a strict and controlling 
single father, decides to escape her 
home after her 16th birthday and 
on the eve of a move to Scotland. 
She is endowed with the ability 
to shape-shift, and discovers that 
she is being followed by Steinar 
(Jóhannes Haukur Jóhannesson, 
“Game of Thrones”). Steinar turns 
out to be a fellow shape-shifter 
sent by her mother, who is under 

the care of a mysterious caretaker 
Ben Halvorson (Guy Pearce, “Jack 
Irish”).

“The Innocents” feels like a 

show comprised of two separate 
shows, each of which is strong 
overall but together, entirely 

dissonant. 
June 
and 
Harry’s 

romance is sweet and realistic, 
and the way they react to troubling 
situations is in tune to their own 
personalities. In the other “world” 
of the story, which is set in a 
stunning Norwegian landscape, 
Pearce plays a cleverly written, 
ambiguous caretaker of shape-
shifters, with sharp dialogue and 
engaging sub stories amongst the 
various residents of the sanctuary 
known as “The Sanctum.”

However, the show never quite 

successfully merges these two 
overarching storylines together. 
Steinar provides the early links, 
but they are never fleshed out in 
the early episodes. The scenes that 
are meant to be disturbing and/or 
enlightening are rarely so, with 
the exception of the actual shape-
shifting scenes. In such scenes, the 
show rarely subverts but drowns 
in well-established tropes, also 
hurt by an unmemorable score. 

Throughout the early episodes, 
the show bounces around several 
tones, but never seems to decide 
on one.

Nonetheless, one of the things 

the show does have going for 
it is its sheer aesthetic beauty. 
The 
aforementioned 
Nordic 

landscapes are brilliantly shot, 
reminiscent of the lair of CEO 
Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac, 
“Annihilation”) in “Ex Machina.” 
They contrast well with the harsh, 
brooding skies and landscapes 
of the UK, where the bulk of the 
action takes place.

Another positive aspect of the 

show is the secondary characters. 
June’s brother Ryan is a recluse 
suffering from agoraphobia, and 
who seems to deeply care for 
his sister. Harry’s scenes with 
his mentally disabled father are 
tender and some of the most 
emotionally charged in the show. 
These characters are fleshed out 
and engaging in their own right, 
and they suggest more sources of 
intrigue in later episodes.

While not as engaging as 

its premise suggests, the early 
episodes of “The Innocents” pose 
a series of intriguing questions, 
especially about what in the world 
connects all of its seemingly 
disparate storylines. Fans of other 
Netflix series such as “Stranger 
Things” will appreciate the sci-fi
 

angle the story takes, while others 
may appreciate the romance and 
simultaneous growth of the teen 
leads. Unfortunately, both of these 
aspects do not form a seamless 
combination.

TV REVIEW

I would never move to a city 

without 
ensuring 
that 
there 

was an independent bookstore 
within walking distance first. A 
community without a bookstore 
is akin to a chest without a beating 
heart. Unable to function, unable 
to exist, without life. A bookstore 
is the type of place that makes a 
community feel like a home. It is 
impossible to imagine a perfectly 
functioning city without at least 
the option to walk a bit and find 
perfect solace between the lines 
of a good book. It comes down to 
storytelling — the sweetness of it, 
the grittiness of it, the heartbreak 
of it and the necessity of it. We 
would not be much without 
stories. Our homes would not 
be much without stories. Our 
cities, our highrises, our public 
parks, our 9-to-5 jobs and our 
family rooms would not be much 
without stories. Our lives need 
independent 
bookstores. 
Our 

lives need books. 

In order for bookstores to 

function, people must read. Our 
communities need readers to 
buy and share books. In a world 
where Amazon is a click away and 
our eyes are glued to our phone 
screens, this proves no small feat. 

Enter: 
Thomson-Shore, 

a 
Dexter, 
Michigan 
book 

manufacturer, printer, publisher 
and distribution company with 
one goal: to celebrate books. In 

Oct. of 2017 the company held 
its first annual “Booktoberfest,” 
which Lori Minnick, an employee 
at Thompson-Shore, described 
as an “opportunity to celebrate 
all things books with the entire 
family” in a recent interview 
with the Daily. The event is a 
celebration of authors, books 
and reading put on by Thomson-
Shore annually and aided by Ann 

Arbor’s own Literati Bookstore. 

Minnick went on to explain 

the event a bit more, which is 
scheduled for this Saturday, Sept. 
8. 

“We have some great authors 

who will be sharing their stories 
and signing books, experts in the 
industry sharing insight, tours 
of our plant showing first-hand 
how books are made, a pitch 
your book contest for authors 
looking for a publishing deal 
and an opportunity for children 
to become published authors,” 
Minnick said.

When asked to describe the 

event in more detail, Minnick 
continued with the idea that 
events like Booktoberfest are 
necessary to get the community 

excited and passionate about 
reading, especially in a time of 
such technological advancement, 
in a world where we are all prone 
to be “too distracted” or “too 
busy” to take the time to read. 

“We celebrate our authors 

accomplishments,” she said. “We 
celebrate that the industry is still 
going strong and we celebrate the 
fact that people still want to hold 
and read real books.”

It comes as a bit of a heartbreak 

that we must be reduced to such 
a phrase — “people still want to 
hold and read real books” — as 
though the practice is falling away 
from us in this 21st century. A 
bookstore is idiosyncratic in this 
way because it holds something 
for everyone. It is a romantic 
practice — book browsing and 
book purchasing and the idea of 
authors putting pen to paper. As 
consumers we are given the gift 
of bookstores — an opportunity 
to walk into a blind date empty 
and walk out in love at first sight 
with words we didn’t even know 
we needed. 

There’s 
something 
special 

about the ability of literature to 
transcend time and space, and 
there’s 
something 
incredibly 

important about ensuring that 
children are a part of the push 
to get people reading again. 
Booktoberfest 
seeks 
out 
a 

variety of activities and authors 
for children in order to ensure 
families will come with their 
young kids, get them excited to 
read new books and ravenous

Booktoberfest will give 
AA a literary awakening

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW
about literature. 

The event is not only important 

for families and book consumers, 
but also writers, as it provides 
a variety of opportunities for 
authors to have their work 
showcased 
and 
new 
writers 

to bring their work to the 
community. 

“Writers 
generally 
are 
so 

involved in writing that they do 
not spend time thinking about the 
tough stuff: publishing,” Minnick 
said. “Once the manuscript is 
complete or close to complete 
there is still a ton to accomplish 
before your book gets to readers. 
This event will offer a treasure 
trove of information for authors 
to consider as they wind down 
their writing process and ramp 
up their publishing activities. 
There is a lot to consider in order 

to publish a book you can be 
proud of.” 

When 
all 
three 
exciting 

elements come together — text, 
author and reader — real magic 
can happen. The community 
sees the need for independent 
bookstores, for new authors and 
for precious stories. The authors 
are inspired to write and the 
books tell the tale on their own. 

“Books are and will remain 

the most affordable vacation 
ever offered,” Minnick said. “In 
a world where people can’t get 
off screens, a paper book offers 
an escape and opportunity to 
focus on just one thing: a story, a 
narration, a biography, an interest. 
People forge relationships with 
physical books and this is across 
generations.” 

Between 
bringing 
the 

community together, celebrating 
books and lifting up new and 
previously 
published 
authors, 

Booktoberfest seems to do it 
all. Most importantly, though, 
Booktoberfest 
restarts 
the 

conversation about storytelling. It 
ignites a fire under a community’s 
belly, mingling the writers with 
the readers and mixing the words 
with moments to make literary 
magic. 

“Books are people,” Minnick 

said. “We celebrate books because 
of what’s in them. Our history, 
our poetry, our stories.”

Books are indeed people, and 

people are stories. Now, more 
than ever, we need so many of 
these things — stories, human 
interaction and words. But most 
importantly, all of us, whoever we 
are, need books.

I caught myself looking at 

the screen a lot that night at 
Ford Field. It’s where I’m most 
used to seeing Taylor Swift, 
how my brain most comfortably 
processes her — broken up 
between camera angles, the 
editing making her into a 
collection of discrete, two-
dimensional images that can be 
twisted small enough to fit into 
a Twitter icon, or stretched out 
to a massive, inhuman size on 
the screens at the end zone of a 
football stadium.

And yet, the real Taylor was 

right there, golden haired and 
sparkling in her many catsuits 
and 
dresses. 
Her 
presence 

looms so large in culture 
and 
memory 
that 
seeing 

her, tiny and present and so 
fundamentally real, felt like an 
earnest shock to the system. 
When the booming opening 
bass notes of “Ready For It” 
kicked off the show, we saw 

her silhouette rising above the 
crowd, hooded and huge, but 
when the glow dropped, it was 
just her. Alone on the massive 
stage, tiny across the waves of 
people and lights in the crowd.

The “Reputation” tour is 

an impeccable tour de force 
pop production, with lighting, 
stage design and choreography 
expertly conceived to create 
an experience that feels both 
massive and intimate. Apart 
from a small issue with the 
sound that slightly pitched up 
Taylor’s voice (though that 
might just be a consequence of 
broadcasting a mic feed across 
a ridiculously huge and kind 
of weirdly shaped venue), the 
show was impeccable, and full 
of brilliant creative details.

Taylor Swift has never been 

much for subtlety, and in live 
performance, the melodrama 
was deliciously entertaining. 
Ninety foot snakes popped up 
during “Look What You Made 
Me Do,” dancers were mounted 
atop golden thrones in “King 
Of My Heart” and Taylor held 

her arms out as though she was 
being crucified on no less than 
two separate occasions. When 
the lyrics called for her to “beg 
you on my knees to stay” you 
can bet she dropped all five 
feet, 11 inches of herself to the 
floor. The girl commits.

Like in her previous tour 

promoting 1989, each person 
in the audience was given a 
bracelet that lit up along with 
the show, and the result was 
a stadium that felt like a self-
contained galaxy, each of us 
equipped with our own little 
stars that shone in purples, 
reds, pinks, blues, golds. And 
really, the show felt like a world 
unto its own, a complete multi-
sensory, 
multi-dimensional 

experience. It was a perfect 
tribute to Taylor’s many old 
and 
new 
identities, 
never 

condescending 
towards 
her 

past selves because she clearly 
understands the intimate way 
her audience invests our lives 
in her own history. Such is the 
power of a Taylor Swift song — 
personal to her, the writer, and

Taylor’s corner: A night at

CONCERT REVIEW

personal to everyone who hears 
it.

It’s unsurprising, then, that 

the best parts of the show 
found 
Taylor 
performing 

alone. Her stage presence and 
easy intimacy with tens of 
thousands of people at once 
just can’t be taught. The night’s 
highlight was “Delicate,” when 
Taylor stepped into a sparkling 
gold cage that floated her up 
over the crowds and across 
the stadium. The screens that 
usually displayed close-ups of 
her face were blacked out and 
speckled only in purple starry 
lights to match our bracelets, 
so that all you could see in the 
stadium were spots of lights and 
the gold orb containing Taylor, 
floating above our heads. “I 
know that it’s delicate,” she 
sang, her voice hushed and 
tender, and the song washed 
over 50,000 people.

She made a great effort to 

bridge old and new material 
— the jaded cool-girl affect 
of “Style” merged seamlessly 
with the sweet earnestness of 
“Love Story”; the righteous 
anger of throwback “Should’ve 
Said No” melded with the petty 
fury of “Bad Blood.” The true 
stroke of genius, though, was 
when she sat at the piano and 
played “Long Live” and “New 
Years Day” together, weaving 
together 
with 
devastating 

precision two of the sweetest 
songs in her catalogue. “Hold 
on to the memories / they will 
hold on to you,” she sang before 
her voice dropped to a low 
murmur, “And I had the time 
of my life with you.” She let the 
piano notes hang in the air for 
a bit before she looked up at us, 
and her face broke into a smile 
as the audience let out the 
loudest cheer of the night. We 
cried, we loved Taylor Swift.

As I was confronted with the 

jarring presence of a person 
who I’d only ever understood 
through screens, I found myself 
thinking a lot that night about 
what that must feel like to be 
Taylor Swift, actual human 
being, so small on a such a big 
stage, everyone looking at you 

and everyone seeing something 
different in your image. What it 
must feel like to run through a 
crowd of people carrying signs 
with your name and your face, 
hordes of strangers reaching 
for you with arms outstretched 
and trying to grab at different 
parts of you. What do we want 
from Taylor, and what does she 
want from us? What is it like 
to have complete strangers say 
they love you? What is it like to 
maybe love them back?

It’s long been commented 

that Taylor’s most valuable 
skill as a pop star is her ability 
to make a sentiment, song 

or moment intended to be 
consumed by millions feel as 
though it’s directed at each 
individual person experiencing 
it. And to be sure, there’s 
an element of manipulation 
to that, the way her public 
persona deliberately cultivates 
a 
parasocial 
relationship 

between her and her fans. 
Through 
little 
tidbits 
of 

admissions in her music, social 
media and public profile, her 
fans feel like we know her 
when we clearly don’t, like we 
might even love her.

It’s a strange paradox — 

intimacy created not despite 
distance between audience and 
performer, but rather because of 
it. Still, I think the distance can 
be desensitizing sometimes. 
It’s easy to take a pop star of 

Swift’s 
popularity, 
impact, 

fame and notoriety and see her 
only as a nexus of conversation, 
a figure onto which we can 
project pretty much anything. 
A concept that we can discuss, 
use as a framework for debates 
about gender, class, race and 
pretty much every other topic 
you can possibly think of. It’s 
easy to forget in all the talk 
about the concept of Taylor 
Swift™, that there’s a very real 
Taylor Swift. It’s only in these 
rare spaces where it’s possible 
to make a real life contact 
and connection that we can 
remember there’s a version 
of Taylor who’s just a person. 
Talented and charismatic and 
wildly wealthy and popular, 
sometimes kind and sometimes 
vicious, sometimes hungry and 
sometimes tired, sometimes 
her best self and sometimes 
her worst self — but at all times 
human.

“Can I tell you guys a secret?” 

she asked halfway through the 
show, standing alone on stage in 
a glittery leotard and oversized 
patchy jacket, strumming her 
guitar. “This tour is the most 
fun I’ve ever had.” She looked 
out at us and smiled, and there 
was a cunning glint in her eyes 
as she let us into her world, 
each of us made to believe we 
were her co-conspirators and 
the keepers of her secrets. I 
saw real love in that look, too — 
but I’m sure someone else saw 
something different.

She ended the show with 

a mashup of “We Are Never 
Ever Getting Back Together” 
and “This Is Why We Can’t 
Have Nice Things,” storms of 
confetti raining down on us and 
the lights on our wristbands 
going haywire with colors. 
The screens and the stage 
were configured to look like an 
opulent mansion as she danced 
around in her glittering purple 
dress, leading the audience 
in a cathartic, floor-stomping 
chant. She took a bow and the 
doors of the mansion locked. 
Then said she loved us one last 
time — and in a flash, she was 
gone.

Taylor Swift has 
never been much 
for subtlety, and in 
live performance, 
the melodrama 
was deliciously 

entertaining

Behind Enemy Lines: A conversation 
with an MLive WMU football beat writer

By MAX MARCOVITCH

Daily Sports Editor

Michigan’s home opener this 
year comes without much of the 
normal pomp and circumstance. 
The curtain has been lifted on 
this team, and the opening act left 
much to be desired. Last week’s 
loss to Notre Dame eliminated 
some of the revelatory intrigue 
that often accompanies this week. 
In comes Western Michigan — 
traveling just over 100 miles to the 
east — to take on the Wolverines 
on 
Saturday 
at 
Michigan 
Stadium. 
Both 
teams are 0-1. 
The Broncos 
enter the game 
off a 55-42 loss 
to 
Syracuse, 
in 
hopes 
of 
spurring 
an 
unprecedented 
upset 
behind 
a 
surprisingly 
upstart offense. 
The 
Daily 
spoke to Patrick 
Nothaft, a reporter for MLive and 
Kalamazoo Gazette reporter, to 
learn about Western Michigan’s 
strength and weaknesses, and how 
the two teams might match up on 
Saturday.
The Michigan Daily: From a 
national perspective, people knew 
Western for PJ Fleck — he sort 
of put Western on the map. How 
would you describe the state of the 
program at this point?
Patrick Nothaft: I would say 
that, honestly, the excitement from 
that undefeated regular season 
is kind of wearing off, just from 
looking around town, you don’t see 
as much of the support around the 
street — all the Western flags in 
the business windows and all that 
kinda thing that you saw during 
the undefeated season.
I will say the expectations were 
pretty high last year. I know a lot of 
people — especially after hanging 
tough with USC week one — were 
expecting better than 6-6. It’s 
hard to just look at the record and 
say the season was a total failure, 
because there were just so many 
injuries. They had 21 guys that 
were 
season-enders, 
including 
the quarterback. And as it turned 
out, the backup was not ready for 

Division I college football. He 
left the program and isn’t playing 
football anymore. So it was a 
pretty rough go offensively.
When other teams are putting 
10 guys in the box daring you to 
throw, and you still can’t throw, 
it’s a pretty disappointing product 
as a fan to watch, just because 
you get in a lot of third-and-long 
situations and you can’t pass. Last 
year obviously didn’t go that well. 
It seems like reading some of 
the reactions from the fans this 
year, there’s just not that much 
excitement. They think a middle-
of-the-pack MAC finish is on the 
table this year. But I think that, as 
far as what the coaching staff is 
doing, they have the right people 
in place for future success. They 
only have 10 seniors on this team. 
I think they’re headed in the right 
direction. I think Tim Munster is a 
really good offensive coach, but it’s 
just going to take a little bit of time.
TMD: What did you make of the 
game against Syracuse?
Nothaft: I thought the offense 
was definitely a bright spot, at 
least in the second half. They 
hit some big plays. I think I said 
earlier, the passing game just 
couldn’t get on track last year at 
all. For them to come out, and 
drove for almost 380 yards and 
three touchdowns, including that 
84-yarder from John Wassink to 
(D’Wayne) Eskridge. I thought 
that was really good to see. They 
still got their yards rushing the 
ball, even though they kind of 
abandoned the run game after 
they got that huge first-half hole. 
I think that the offense was really 
encouraging. But the defense, on 
the other hand, definitely wasn’t. 
To let a quarterback run for 200 
yards on 15 carries is not what 
you want to see. I think people 
are going to find out as the season 
goes on, the Syracuse quarterback 
is probably one of the best dual 
threat guys in the country. He led 
Syracuse to a win over Clemson 
last year. They’re not really going 
to see that caliber of quarterback 
going forward. I think the defense 
will show improvement, but the 
offense is what really surprised 
me, with how well it’s clicking.
TMD: Is that what you expected 
coming into the year — an offense 
that was going to be the strength 
of the year, with a defense that lags 

behind?
Nothaft: I think that was a 
surprise. People had questions 
about quarterback John Wassink 
coming off his season-ending 
surgery to repair his broken 
collarbone. People didn’t really 
know what to expect. He started 
out terrible against USC and 
Michigan State, which isn’t too 
unexpected for a guy making his 
first two career starts on the road 
like that. He settled down in MAC 
play. I think people just kind of 
wondered if his 14:2 interception 
ratio that he posted in MAC play, 
if that was going to carry over. 
And it turns out that he’s picking 
up right where he left off, at least 
he did against Syracuse anyway. 
Things are going to go a little 
bit differently against Michigan 
because their defense is so good. 
I think him being able to hit those 
big plays and loss passes was 
definitely a surprise because they 
couldn’t do it all last year. That was 
the one weakness of the offense, 
was that they could not stretch the 
field.
TMD: For Michigan fans who 
might be unfamiliar with Western, 
who are a few players they should 
be looking out for?
Nothaft: I would say the 
running back Levante Dollomy. 
During the summer in practice, he 
ran a 4.32 40-(yard dash). So he 
is definitely fast. There’s probably 
very few Michigan players who 

will catch him from behind if he 
gets loose in the open field. 
Their wide receiver (D’Wayne) 
Eskridge. He had that 84-yard 
touchdown catch against Syracuse. 
He’s another guy, he posted a 4.33 
40-(yard dash) over the summer. If 
he gets behind Lavert Hill or David 
Long, it’s going to be really tough 
for those guys to catch him. If I 
were the Michigan cornerbacks, 
I wouldn’t gamble. I’d just try to 
keep him in front of me. If you can 
put a hit on him right as he catches 
it, that’ll work out in their favor a 
little bit more.
I think those are the two 
big guys on offense. Those are 
pretty much Western’s two main 
playmakers.
TMD: Are there any other 
matchups that you think might give 
Michigan trouble — specifically on 
the other side of the ball?
Nothaft: 
Everyone 
knows 
how bad Michigan’s tackles have 
looked. Notre Dame has a real 
good front. Western has some 
decent defensive ends. I don’t 
want to call out anyone by name, 
but the ends of the offensive line 
kind of look lost. Whether or not 
they can beat Western’s defensive 
ends one-on-one is a fair question, 
I think. They’re not really the 
biggest defensive ends, I think 
they’re both around 240 pounds. 
That could be somewhere where 
Western Michigan has an edge, 
but I’d expect if Michigan’s having 

trouble with that, they’ll just rely 
on the ground game, because 
Western’s 
interior 
defensive 
linemen 
aren’t 
very 
big 
and 
Michigan’s guys are huge. I think 
they could push them off the ball, 
and just run it and escape with a 
pretty easy win.
TMD: If Western is to hang 
around in this one, what are a few 
keys to that?
Nothaft: I think turnovers 
will be huge. If they can get to 
Shea Patterson and force some 
fumbles, that’s a really good way 
to put Michigan in a hole. If they 
can hit some big plays over the top, 
like they did against Syracuse — 
I’m sure that Michigan’s watched 
the film on Western, so they know 
they have some speed guys. But if 
Western can find a way to get some 
of their receivers behind defensive 
backs — no matter where they 
are on the field — that could be a 
touchdown. 
So I think those are the two big 
things: connecting on some keys 
plays offensively and then forcing 
some 
turnovers 
and 
getting 
pressure on Patterson.
TMD: Prediction?
Nothaft: I said at the beginning 
of the season it’d probably about 
38-14, Michigan. I think it’ll 
probably be a little higher scoring, 
just based on how many points 
Western gave up against Syracuse. 
So I guess right now I’d probably 
say 42-17, Michigan.

Formally a Wolverine, Drake 

Harris will return to Ann 

Arbor on Saturday a Bronco.

 Drake Harris will run through 
the 
Michigan 
Stadium 
tunnel 
Saturday. His band will play the 
fight song, and his team will take 
the field.
Since arriving in Ann Arbor five 
years ago, it will be the last time 
Harris will play in front of the 
Wolverine faithful.
That’s because he transferred to 
Western Michigan this past year.
Harris was supposed to be a lot of 
things: a basketball star, the leading 
receiver in Michigan high school 
history, the next great Michigan 
receiver. But after twists and turns, 
some bad luck and a few injuries, 
Harris’ new home is with the team 
that will be on the opposing sideline 
from the one he last called home.
Drake Harris is a Bronco now.
That’s not how it was supposed to 
be.

***

Everyone thought Harris would 
end up a basketball player.
He started playing in third grade, 
at Hoop City in his hometown of 
Grand Rapids, Mich. That’s where 
Harris first met Drew Zuidema, 
his best friend and a four-year 
basketball player at Spring Arbor 
University.
At that age, talent is rough and 
hard to identify. But as Harris 
grew up, he got bigger, and his pure 
athleticism became apparent. First 
he joined the Grand Rapids Storm 
in the AAU and then moved on to 
the Chicago MeanStreets of Nike’s 
Elite Youth Basketball League. It’s 
the same program that produced 

Derrick Rose, Eric Gordon and 
Anthony Davis.
“I mean, I remember going to 
games and watching him go up 
against D’Angelo Russell, you name 
it, Stanley Johnson, and he killed 
them.” Zuidema said. “If we’re 
gonna be honest, he was night 
and day better than like all those 
dudes.”
With that success, football took 
a clear backseat, and with good 
reason. By the time Harris began 
his freshman year at Grand Rapids 
Christian High School, he already 
had 
a 
scholarship 
offer 
from 
Indiana and had built a strong 
relationship with Michigan State 
basketball coach Tom Izzo.
But Grand Rapids Christian football 
coach Don Fellows saw the impact 
Harris, a tall, lanky, athletic freak, 
could make on the football field. 
Harris had played football before, 
with the Seidman Boys and Girls 
Club in Grand Rapids when he was 
younger, but Zuidema says Harris 
sustained a few injuries playing the 
sport back then, and he shied away 
from it.
With the help of Harris’ father 
Mike, though, and even some 
coercing from Izzo, who likes two-
sport athletes, Fellows convinced 
the young receiver to transition 
back to the football field. Harris 
played on the freshman team that 
season, then moved up to varsity 
his sophomore year. That’s when 
things started to shift, as Harris 
went for over 1,000 yards receiving 
with 12 touchdowns.
But just as his football career 
was starting to ramp up, Harris 
committed to play basketball at 
Michigan State that summer, in 
2012.
“If Drake had to do it over again, 
he’d probably tell you that Coach 

Izzo was the coach that he trusts 
most out of this whole thing,” 
Fellows said. “And Coach has been 
really good to Drake since then, 
so that’s a compliment to him. 
But I think Drake committed to 
Michigan State early to get the 
pressure off of him.”
The next season, Harris set the 
world on fire. He went for 2,015 
yards, an Michigan High School 
Athletic Association record, and 
25 touchdowns, the second-best 
mark in MHSAA history. In the 
state championship game, Harris 
accumulated 243 yards and two 
touchdowns against Orchard Lake 
St. Mary’s. The guy who matched 
up with Harris that game? Eventual 
Michigan State legend Jalen Watts-
Jackson.
From 
there, 
the 
offers 
came 
streaming in. Zuidema says Harris 
would get texts from football 
coaches across the country — 
sometimes 15 in a day — and it put 
the pressure right back on.
“We’d be at home playing video 
games or something, because he 
basically lived with me in high 
school,” Zuidema said. “I mean, you 
name it, whatever college coach in 
the country was blowing his phone 
up. I mean, I remember teams like 
Tennessee and SEC coaches texting 
him like 10 or 15 times a day. He 
struggled with that a lot, because 
it was so many teams that hitting 
him up at that point, he didn’t know 
what to do, because it’s hard to 
respond to every single one, acting 
like you’re kind of interested.”
In 
March 
of 
2013, 
Harris 
decommitted from the Spartans.
Just over a month later, Harris 
went on a visit to Michigan’s spring 
game in 2013. Zuidema, a Michigan 
State fan himself, came with him. 
“They laid out the red carpet,” 

Zuidema 
said. 
“They 
did 
everything. Even I walked away 
from it, like, that’s pretty damn 
good. … He wanted to be close to 
home too. He wanted his family 
and friends to watch him.”
A day after that visit, Harris 
committed to the Wolverines and 
coach Brady Hoke.

***

Local stardom isn’t all it’s cracked 
up to be, especially when things 
go wrong.
Before 
Harris’ 
senior 
season even began, 
he 
suffered 
a 
hamstring injury, 
and 
he 
never 
played a game.
In 
just 
two 
seasons, 
he 
finished with 
the 
fourth-
most 
career 
yards 
(3,133) 
and the eighth-
most 
career 
touchdowns 
(37) in MHSAA 
history.
With that, rumors 
swirled. 
People 
wondered if Harris was 
really 
sitting 
out 
with 
an injury or if there was 
something else at foot, but 
Harris kept a cool head.
“I hear people say he got in 
trouble,” Mike said. “And I’m 
like, ‘News to me! I’m his dad! 
I’m a cop! People can come 
up with the craziest stuff, 
you know, and the craziest 
thing is if you’re good at 
something, people want 
you to fail. It’s sad that 
some people are like 

that. It is. He had to battle through 
all that, and, like I said, I think it 
made him stronger today.”
Added Zuidema: “People would 
come up to me, and I’d be like, 
‘Dude, I’m his best friend. He never 
did anything.’ … I think that was the 
local, I mean, people just talking. 
People didn’t like him, because 
you couldn’t really stop him, 
obviously. He 
had 
that 


hamstring injury, and it 
was legit, and he could 
never really rattle that. And 
I’ve never had a hamstring 
(injury), but he said it was 
the most painful thing ever 
and it kept coming back to 
him.”
The season passed, but the 
hamstring injuries persisted. 
Harris left for Ann Arbor, 
joining a roster that was 
already packed with talent, 
still trying to return from his 
setback. Harris redshirted 
the 2014 season.
That year, the Wolverines 
went 5-7, and at season’s 
end, Hoke was out and Jim 
Harbaugh came in.
A new wrench was thrown 
into Harris’ plans.

***

Harris 
and 
Harbaugh 
seemed, at first, to be a great 
match.
Before the season began, 
Harris 
generated 
buzz. 
Next to the likes of Amara 
Darboh and Jehu Chesson, 
who ended up starting the 
season, Harris looked to be 
emerging as a strong option 
in Harbaugh’s offense.
However, 
when 
the 
Wolverines 
opened 
their 
season with a loss to Utah, 
Harris didn’t catch a pass. It 
was a preview of the career 
to come.
“I would be at mostly every 
home game with his parents, 
I mean, my dad would go, 
and we were so frustrated,” 
Zuidema said. “I mean that’s 
what it is. It’s the B1G. It’s 
D-I. Harbaugh comes in. He 
has his studs come in, and 
Drake would try every day 
in practice. He would send 
me videos like the last two 
years of Jabrill Peppers and 
(Jourdan) Lewis on him, just 
killing them.
“… 
He 
always 
respects 
Harbaugh and all that stuff, 
it’s just that transition was 
tough for him.”
Harris, 
the 
four-star 
recruit, one of the most 
prolific 
receivers 
in 
the 
history of Michigan high 
school football, played just 
26 games in his Michigan 
career, finishing with nine 
catches for 60 yards and zero 
touchdowns.
Mixed along the way were 
rumors 
of 
injuries 
and 
position changes. Harris was 
a long way removed from the 
days of dominating future 
NBA all-stars on the EYBL 

circuit.
“I think that the system 
that Michigan runs isn’t 
necessarily a system for 
Drake,” Fellows said. “I’ve 
always been amazed that 
people don’t take vertical 
shots with Drake, and the 
last couple years I have been 
watching them — obviously 
I’m 
not 
judging 
Coach 
Harbaugh — it just doesn’t 
seem like there were that 
many opportunities in their 
system to utilize him. So I 
think it wasn’t necessarily 
a personality conflict or 
anything like that, I’m just 
not sure that Drake fit their 
system, per se.”
Showing his mental fortitude 
again, though, Harris stuck 
it out. He earned his degree 
in marketing and sales, then 
transferred 
back 
to 
the 
west side, to join Western 
Michigan.

***

Now Harris is a Bronco.
Fellows helped with the that 
recruitment, as he knows 
Western Michigan defensive 
coordinator Lou Esposito.
Mike says his son trusts 
Broncos coach Tim Lester 
like he trusted Hoke when 
he first committed.
According 
to 
Zuidema, 
Harris had offers from all 
over the country again, but 
he wanted to stay close to 
home.
“It was all up to Drake,” 
Mike said. “He’s old enough 
now 
to 
make 
his 
own 
choices, but you’ve gotta 
live with the choices. So we 
don’t have any regrets. Now, 
personally, with some of 
the things that happened 
to the kid, oh yeah, we’re 
a little upset about, but 
I’ll just keep that to 
myself. 
Because 
we 
know, Drake Harris 
is a great kid with 
great 
character. 
And 
my 
thing 
is, 
character-wise, he’s 
gonna 
stand 
out 
regardless 
when 
he’s done playing 
football 
above 
anything else. 
So my biggest 
thing 
with 
everything 
is 
he 
made the 
choices 
he 
made.
“And 

you know what? He got 
a great degree at a great 
university at Michigan. But, 
athletically, we just felt he 
never got the opportunities 
he should have, and you 
know hey it is what it is.”
In his opening game, a 
Western Michigan loss to 
Syracuse, 55-42, Harris got 
eight targets, hauling in one 
of them for 12 yards.
For some receivers, that 
would 
be 
disappointing. 
For Harris, it’s a welcome 
change to get those targets, 
to just get the chance to 
make a play again.
Saturday, he’ll get another 
chance, this time against 
the Wolverines. He’ll meet 
up at pregame with his 
old teammates and 
then match up 
against them.
“Drake 
is 
super 
polished 
on 

knowing what to say, because 
he’s 
been 
dealing 
with 
this for eight, nine years,” 
Fellows said. “So he’s saying 
the 
right 
things, 
‘This 
will 
be 
exciting for my 
teammates, 
this 
and 
that.’ But 
I know 
deep 
down, 
you 

know, 
if 
he 
gets 
the 
opportunity to make a lot of 
plays, I think it’s just human 
nature to be able to prove 
people 
wrong, 
I 
think 
Drake is 

excited 
about 
that 
opportunity.
“But you’ll never catch him 
saying anything, nor has 
he said anything to me. I’m 
speaking for him. I think 
he’d relish the opportunity 
to be super successful in that 
situation.”
From all accounts, Harris 
still wants a chance at the 
NFL. Saturday will be his 
best opportunity to show 
that he’s capable.
Zuidema and Mike will 
be 
watching 
from 
the 
stands. 
Harbaugh 
will 
be watching from the 
sideline. The world will 
be watching from their 
television sets.
Harris still has a chance 
to achieve the goals he 
always wanted.
It’s almost like normal.
But this isn’t quite 
how it was 
supposed 
to be.

Breakdown: Michigan vs. WMU

By ETHAN WOLFE 

Daily Sports Writer

Six days after losing to No. 8 
Notre Dame, the sky still isn’t 
falling and Michigan football is 
still playing in its home opener 
on Saturday against Western 
Michigan.
But what happened in South 
Bend was more realization than 
revelation — the oft-praised 
Wolverines (0-1 overall) had 
problems to manage on both 
sides of the ball. The offensive 
line alone provided a season’s 
worth 
of 
concerns 
limiting 
Michigan’s potential.
But Jim Harbaugh announced 
that he had no plans to make 
personnel changes just yet. So 
the same rotation that took the 
field Sept. 1 will get its chance at 
redemption in front of its home 
crowd against the Broncos (0-1).
Western Michigan lost its 
season opener in a shootout at 
home to Syracuse, 55-42. While 
the 
Broncos 
showcased 
an 
explosive offense, their defense 
was 
the 
polar 
opposite, 
a 
concern that set the Wolverines 
as the 25.5-point favorite to win.
Here’s how Michigan matches 
up against Western Michigan on 
Saturday.

Michigan 
pass 
offense 
vs. Western Michigan pass 
defense

Tackles Jon Runyan Jr. and 
Juwann Bushell-Beatty would 
have been better off as ghosts 
on some plays against Notre 
Dame. All three sacks came 
from Runyan on the left side, 
but Bushell-Beatty had his own 
struggles surrendering pressure 
on the right. Even established 
players struggled. Sophomore 
center Cesar Ruiz allowed a 
hurry that resulted in a Notre 
Dame interception.
Michigan has a more than 
capable quarterback in junior 
Shea 
Patterson, 
who 
has 
weapons at his disposal in a 
deep tight end and wide receiver 
group. But Patterson will need 
time to throw — a proposition 
that looks feasible against the 
Broncos’ weak defensive front.
Western Michigan gave up 
just 11 completions against the 
Orange, but got burned for 226 
yards 
and 
two 
touchdowns 
when 
the 
Broncos 
were 
already getting pummeled by 

the Syracuse rushing attack. 
Western 
Michigan’s 
defense 
totaled two sacks and three 
hurries, 
hardly 
surpassable 
numbers 
against 
stronger 
competition. It also floundered 
against taller receivers — a fate 
that could bode well for 6-foot-
4 Nico Collins. Saturday could 
be a breakthrough opportunity 
for the Wolverines’ unproven 
offense.

Edge: Michigan

Michigan 
run 
offense 
vs. Western Michigan run 
defense

Michigan’s supposed running 
back rotation never came to 
life against Notre Dame. Senior 
Karan Higdon toted the ball 
21 times for 72 yards and a 

touchdown, while junior Chris 
Evans recorded just two carries 
the 
whole 
night. 
Higdon’s 
touchdown 
— 
the 
offense’s 
lone score — came in what was 
essentially garbage time late in 
the fourth quarter.
The coaching staff clearly 
sees Higdon as a three-down 
back, despite rushing for only 
3.4 yards per carry behind a 
flat-footed offensive line. If 
there was ever a time to rotate 
with Evans and No. 3 back 
Tru Wilson, it’s in the non-
conference slate.
The running game should 
have no trouble getting back 
on track, though, against the 
Broncos. Against the Orange, 
Western Michigan surrendered 
200 
rushing 
yards 
to 
Eric 
Dungey, who now holds the 
Atlantic 
Coast 
Conference’s 

single-game 
quarterback 
rushing record. The Broncos 
also allowed five touchdowns on 
the ground.
Michigan is yet to establish 
a prominent run game, though 
history 
suggests 
that 
will 
be short-lived with Western 
Michigan’s 
front 
seven. 
Patterson doesn’t have to be a 
hero in this one.

Edge: Michigan

Western 
Michigan 
pass 
offense vs. Michigan pass 
defense

Cornerbacks 
coach 
Mike 
Zordich 
knew 
Notre 
Dame 
would catch the ball against 
his secondary. The Fighting 
Irish’s primary receivers were 
no less than four inches taller 

and 20 pounds heavier than his 
defensive backs, and their size 
was on full display in the first 
half before a relative shutout in 
the second half.
Safeties Tyree Kinnel and 
Brad Hawkins led the way 
with eight and six tackles, 
respectively, while fifth-year 
senior 
cornerback 
Brandon 
Watson intercepted a pass. Star 
corners Lavert Hill and David 
Long struggled early on, but 
regained their footing.
The defensive back rotation 
may not have much work to do

given 
the 
pressure 
that 
Broncos’ 
quarterback 
Jon 
Wassink will face, but could 
see a different kind of battle 
on Saturday than they did 
the previous week. Western 
Michigan’s D’Wayne Eskridge, 
at 5-foot-9, put up video game 
numbers 
against 
Syracuse, 
hauling in eight catches for 
240 yards and two scores. His 
counterpart, Jayden Reed, had 
a noteworthy seven receptions 
for 121 yards and a touchdown 
himself.
The numbers are 
jarring, 
but Wassink will likely have 
less time to throw. Michigan’s 
secondary is still elite, and will 
ultimately have what it takes to 
limit the Broncos’ aerial attack.

Edge: Michigan

Western 
Michigan 
run 
offense 
vs. 
Michigan 
run 
defense

LeVante 
Bellamy 
has 
4.4 
speed and a solid offensive 
line that helped him pull off 
a 64-yard touchdown versus 
Syracuse. But he is largely 
unproven and has never faced a 
defensive front like the one the 
Wolverines boast.
Last Saturday, Michigan often 
found 
itself 
overcommitting 
against dual-threat quarterback 
Brandon Wimbush, who had 
success finding his receivers 
on crossing patterns or taking 
off 
running 
himself. 
But 
Wassink isn’t Wimbush, and the 
Wolverines mostly had success 
stuffing Notre Dame’s running 
backs.
Western 
Michigan 
doesn’t 
bring anything that Michigan 
either 
hasn’t 
seen 
or 
has 
gotten burned on in the past. 
With Rashan Gary and Chase 
Winovich coming around the 
edges and Devin Bush and 
Khaleke Hudson crashing down, 

the defense should have its way 
on Saturday.

Edge: Michigan

Special teams

Early on, the Wolverines’ 
and 
Broncos’ 
special 
teams 
units are hardly differentiable, 
though 
Michigan 
holds 
the 
slight advantage. Sophomore 
Ambry Thomas broke off a 
99-yard kick return touchdown 
when the Wolverines needed it 
in the worst way against Notre 
Dame. But sophomore Donovan 
Peoples-Jones misplayed a punt 
return to end the first half and 
showed little more. Sophomore 
Will Hart booted three punts 
for an average of 44 yards, 
compared to the Broncos’ five 
punts and 36-yard average.
Michigan redshirt sophomore 
kicker 
Quinn 
Nordin 
hit 
a 
28-yard field goal, but missed 

his chance at a second when 
Hart botched a hold. Western 
Michigan’s Josh Grant missed 
his only attempt of the year, 
but was 6-for-6 on extra points. 
Both teams have their respective 
issues, but the Wolverines have 
had the more concrete results to 
start.

Edge: Michigan

Intangibles

Michigan has the most at 
stake given its expectations and 
desire to rebound. Patterson, 
while 
showing 
flashes 
of 
confidence, is still looking to 
prove his worth alongside his 
receiving unit. The offensive 
line, deemed a strength by Ruiz, 
needs immediate improvement.
Western Michigan is still 
working out the kinks with its 
second-year coach Tim Lester. 
The Broncos are young and 

introduced 
the 
second-best 
recruiting class in the Mid-
American Conference, but are 
still putting the pieces together 
after an undefeated 2016 season. 
That chemistry doesn’t seem 
like it can happen at Michigan 
Stadium.

Edge: Michigan

The 
Wolverines 
have 
the 
upper hand in every category, 
but 
as 
seen 
on 
Saturday, 
improvement 
opportunities 
are aplenty. Western Michigan 
has playmakers, but its defense 
could face problems against a 
Michigan offense that is still 
figuring through things on its 
own.

Prediction: 
Michigan 
41, 
Western Michigan 17

What to Watch For: WMU

By MARK CALCAGNO 

Daily Sports Editor

Last 
week, 
the 
Michigan 
football 
team 
entered 
Notre 
Dame Stadium looking for a 
statement win. And as had been 
the case the previous 16 times 
the Wolverines played a ranked 
team on the road, they didn’t get 
one.
On 
the 
surface, 
a 
24-17 
defeat at hands of the country’s 
twelfth-ranked team isn’t that 
concerning. 
But 
aspects 
of 
Michigan’s performance were.
Western 
Michigan 
(1-0 
overall) doesn’t provide a chance 
to snap an ugly streak or earn that 
marquee win. But it does supply 
the 21st-ranked Wolverines (0-1) 
an opportunity to shore up areas 
that cost them last week. 
Here’s what to watch for in 
Saturday’s home opener.
Offensive line play
Shea Patterson spent much 
of his Michigan debut under 
duress. The junior quarterback 
was sacked twice and pressured 
on numerous other occasions 
— sometimes even left with no 
fighting chance just moments 
after the snap.
Simply, the Wolverines’ most 
glaring issue last week was its 
offensive line. But you wouldn’t 
have known it from what Jim 
Harbaugh said Monday. 
“Yeah, 
I 
thought 
it 
was 
improved,” Harbaugh said. “We 
look at it and there was probably 
a few boxes that you check and 
say, ‘Hey, this is improved.’ That 
was another area I think was 
improved and we continue to get 
better in that area, but I think it 
was one of the areas that I think 
we’re improving on.”
Though many college teams 
have established chemistry by 
the end of camp, junior tight end 
Sean McKeon thinks more game 
experience will aid Michigan’s 
offensive line.
“I thought (the line) looked 
good,” 
McKeon 
said. 
“The 
offensive line, obviously, they 
gotta work to build chemistry, 
maybe even more than they tried 
to build in camp. So just got to 
build more chemistry up front.”
Well, 
Saturday 
is 
another 
chance for that — although one 
has to wonder if the Wolverines 
will consider playing redshirt 
freshman James Hudson or true 
freshman Jaylen Mayfield more 

at tackle. Senior Jon Runyan 
Jr. was noticeably overmatched 
against the Fighting Irish, but 
Harbaugh said he’s sticking with 
the same group of Runyan, Ben 
Bredeson, Cesar Ruiz, Michael 
Onwenu and Juwann Bushell-
Beatty this weekend.
Regardless of who finishes 
the game, however, for the sake 
of Patterson’s health and his 
offense, 
Michigan’s 
offensive 
line needs to show improvement.
Tight ends, Oliver Martin
Michigan’s tight ends were 
the lone bright spot of its passing 
game a season ago. But against 
Notre Dame, McKeon as well as 
juniors Zack Gentry and Nick 
Eubanks combined for just 31 
yards on five catches.
A 
6-foot-7 
target, 
Gentry 
helped the Wolverines pick up 
a first down early, but couldn’t 
pull down a catchable potential 
touchdown pass in the second 
quarter. McKeon and Eubanks, 
meanwhile, 
were 
held 
quiet 
by the Fighting Irish’s speedy 
linebackers.
Yet the ho-hum effort could 
be viewed as a positive for 
Michigan. 
The 
Wolverines 
finally got solid production from 
their receivers, who caught just 
two touchdown passes all last 
year. Though they didn’t get to 
the endzone last Saturday, Nico 
Collins, Donovan Peoples-Jones, 
Grant Perry and Oliver Martin 
were productive with 17 catches 
for 181 yards.
Now the challenge is ensuring 
the tight ends and receivers are 
effective concurrently.

When 
asked 
if 
Michigan 
would look to its tight ends more 
against the Broncos, Harbaugh 
on Monday didn’t give an explicit 
direction. But the answer should 
be yes.
The Wolverines need more 
from 
Gentry, 
McKeon 
and 
Eubanks. 
Combining 
the 
reliability the group provided 
last season with the flashes 
the receivers showed Saturday 
would make life significantly 
easier for Patterson.
And so would more of Martin.
In his first collegiate affair, 
Martin 
did 
exactly 
what 
receivers are supposed to do 
with a scrambling quarterback: 
find open space. On a third-and-
seven late during Michigan’s 
lone offensive touchdown drive, 
Martin saw Patterson moving to 
his right and jolted towards the 
hash to catch a 21-yard pass. 
“I had a seam release corner, 
and cover-2, and I kinda got 
bumped outside a little bit early,” 
Martin said on Tuesday. “So I got 
on the sideline quick, and then I 
saw Shea scrambling and kinda 
motioned me in. And I saw the 
defense kinda overplay a little 
bit, so I just cut back across the 
field and there was that little 
hole in the defense that he hit me 
on.”
Despite the lopsided score, 
the play didn’t go unnoticed. 
Receivers coach Jim McElwain 
mentioned 
that 
Martin 
and 
freshman Ronnie Bell would 
receive more playing time this 
week.

Josh 
Metellus’ 
(second) 
debut
Josh Metellus finished his 
day in South Bend after just 
five minutes and 54 seconds. 
Attempting to dislodge a pass on 
the Notre Dame’s second drive, 
the junior safety was called for 
targeting and ejected.
Cornerbacks coach Michael 
Zordich said the play made him 
re-examine how the targeting 
rule is called.
“Was it helmet to helmet? 
I don’t know,” Zordich said. 
“Looked like a shoulder to me. 
But you gotta be smart. The play 
was made.”
Sophomore Brad Hawkins was 
adequate after the ejection in 
replacement — besides allowing 
43-yard touchdown pass to Chris 
Finke — but Saturday will be 
Metellus’ first true opportunity 
of the season. Despite being an 
All-Big Ten honorable mention 
in 2017, Metellus acknowledged 
he needed to improve in man and 
slot coverage — a priority across 
the safety position in fall camp.
And though Western Michigan 
is no Notre Dame, it has weapons 
that 
could 
make 
Michigan’s 
defense 
pay. 
Wide 
receiver 
D’Wayne Eskridge caught eight 
passes for 240 yards and two 
touchdowns against Syracuse, 
using his straight-line speed to 
burn safeties over the top.
Former 
Michigan 
receiver 
Drake Harris is also a threat 
for the Broncos — though he 
made only one catch last week. 
Still, there’s a rare challenge in 
facing a player who knows the 

Wolverines inside and out. 
“We know Drake is a really 
good athlete. Hell of a basketball 
player,” Zordich said. “He can 
jump through the roof, so you 
gotta watch him. And then 
(Eskridge), really, damn good 
game last week. Really explosive, 
very fast, so there’s a challenge 
for (both) of those guys for us.”
Added Harbaugh: “(They’re) 
very 
aggressive. 
The 
game 
against Syracuse was a hard-
fought game. They battled. So, 
that’s what we’re getting to 
know right now. We looked at 
the team in the summer. … Been 
impressed.”
Bottom line and prediction
Last week wasn’t a confidence-
inspiring 
performance 
for 
Michigan. Notre Dame stepped 
on the Wolverines’ throat early, 
and 
even 
when 
momentum 
looked to swing, the contest 
never really felt close.
Thus, 
Michigan 
needs 
a 
strong effort from start to finish 
this Saturday. That means no 
early 
defensive 
lapses 
while 
keeping its quarterback upright 
— in addition to capitalizing on 
redzone opportunities. It would 
take a lot for the Wolverines to 
fall, but a lackluster performance 
could further cut confidence in 
Jim Harbaugh’s team.
