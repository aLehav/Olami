The University of Michigan 

Board of Regents met virtually 
Thursday afternoon for the first 
time during the 2021 calendar 
year. During the meeting, board 
members gave updates about the 
current state of the University and 
heard from public commenters 
regarding concerns over lecturer 
status, fund allocations to the 
satellite 
campuses 
and 
the 

University’s COVID-19 response.

Regents Ron Weiser (R) and 

Katherine White (D) were not in 
attendance at the meeting, and 
the reasons for their absence were 
not clarified at the meeting. U-M 
spokesman Rick Fitzgerald later 
confirmed to The Michigan Daily 
that while U-M officials do not 
know why the regents were not in 
attendance, scheduling conflicts 
are not uncommon.

U-M President Mark Schlissel 

began the meeting by providing an 
update on the status of returning 
to more in-person instruction 
for the Fall 2021 semester, which 

will heavily depend on vaccine 
availability. 

“We’re optimistic that fall will 

look and feel much more like a 
normal academic and residential 
term at U of M,” Schlissel said. 
“We’re looking at various scenarios 
based on what fraction of our 
faculty, staff and students are able 
to be vaccinated … We’re hopeful 
that unlike present circumstances, 
COVID-19 vaccine supplies will 
outpace demand in the coming 
months.” 

Regent 
Jordan 
Acker 
(D) 

then 
addressed 
the 
January 

insurrection at the U.S. Capitol 
by supporters of former President 
Donald Trump. 

“We must live in the same basic 

truth: the election of 2020 was not 
stolen, the insurrection was not a 
hoax and our government can only 
endure when the losers of election 
accept the legitimacy of defeat,” 
Acker said. “There was, in fact, no 
steal to stop.” 

Acker’s speech comes after 

calls for the resignation of his 
fellow Regent Weiser from some 
U-M community members. In 
recent weeks, Weiser has come 
under fire from those who think 

he did not adequately denounce 
the riots in the U.S. Capitol and 
has been accused of making 
undisclosed payments to further 
his campaign for Michigan GOP 
Chair. Inappropriate emails from 
Weiser to the other Regents have 
also surfaced in the last few weeks.

In February 2020, the Board of 

Regents announced the University 
would not bring forward any 
new direct investments in fossil 
fuel companies after sustained 
student activism to divest entirely 
from fossil fuels. At Thursday’s 
meeting, Regent Mark Bernstein 
(D) said he and the board have 
been collaborating with activists, 
peer universities and other climate 
experts to find a way to sustainably 
invest the University’s assets, 
but did not otherwise specify the 
University’s next steps.

“We 
aim 
to 
make 
our 
investments 

in a way that contributes to the 
essential transition to a low-carbon 
economy, and we expect to share 
concrete next steps at our next 
board meeting,” Regent Bernstein 
said.

In what some residents are 

calling a jurisdiction-breaching 
move, six Ann Arbor City Council 
members and Mayor Christopher 
Taylor signed a public letter 
Sunday night addressed to the 
Ann Arbor Public Schools Board 
of Education demanding further 
planning and action around a 
return to in-person and hybrid 
learning in the district.

The move comes after weeks 

of debates over the safety of 
in-person teaching and a Jan. 31 
protest by AAPS students and 
parents requesting the option to 
return to classrooms in-person. 
AAPS has been fully virtual since 
March 2020.

According to a Facebook post 

from Councilmember Jen Eyer, 
D-Ward 4, who is one of the 
letter’s signatories, their specific 
demands include an accelerated 
return 
to 
in-person 
learning 

amid declining COVID-19 cases 
and 
increasing 
vaccinations, 

confirmation of the district’s 
hybrid in-school learning plan and 
a target date of return, as well as 
greater communication regarding 
plans for the Fall 2021 semester.

In 
their 
letter, 
the 

councilmembers emphasized the 
importance of in-person learning 
and the negative impact a lack 
of in-person instruction has on 
students’ wellbeing. 

“The 
extended 
absence 
of 

in-school learning harms the 
emotional and mental state of 
students and stresses already 
stressed families,” the letter reads. 
“These harms are universal, but 
they are compounded among 
homes with young students and 
community members who are 
resource-deprived or who have 
special needs.”

This 
letter 
from 
some 

councilmembers 
comes 
after 

AAPS 
Superintendent 
Jeanice 

Swift announced mid-January that 
the district would conduct remote 
instruction 
indefinitely, 
given 

continued difficulty for teachers to 
acquire the COVID-19 vaccine and 
the presence of the B.1.1.7 variant 
in Ann Arbor. She explicitly said 
there was no specific date set 

for the start of hybrid-learning, 
though she wrote that the district 
would plan for possible in-person 
options with community input. 

Swift 
also 
laid 
out 
the 

district’s stages for return to 
in-person 
learning, 
beginning 

with “students with high-level 
specialized learning needs” who 
choose to return. Other priority 
groups include pre-school and 
kindergarten age students as well 
as small groups of middle and high 
school groups to receive in-school 
learning center support. 

In a Jan. 8 press conference, 

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer urged 
all schools to offer in-person 
instruction 
beginning 
March 

1. Despite guidance from the 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention showing that schools 
are not major sites for COVID-19 
transmission if proper protocols 
are enforced, some AAPS parents 
and teachers are reluctant to 
return to classrooms — especially 
as 
COVID-19 
cases 
among 

University of Michigan students 
remain high.

The Michigan Daily’s 2021 

Management Desk voted Feb. 7 to 
prohibit any of The Daily’s editors 
from holding membership in Order 
of Angell, an exclusive senior 
honor society formerly known as 
Michigamua, or any similar society 
at the University of Michigan. 
This decision was made after 
recognizing that Order’s nature 
and those of other such societies 
goes against the mission and ethos 
of The Daily, as well as to denounce 
Order’s egregiously racist past.

As a news organization, The 

Daily 
aims 
for 
transparency 

and accountability of all public 
institutions. 
Order 
and 
other 

organizations like it, which bring 
together powerful student leaders 

from across campus and do not 
publicize their actions, are the 
antithesis of that.

Order’s “About Us” page and its 

members have always been vague 
about its activities, which the 
group’s members have previously 
attributed to the organization’s 
historical pillar of “humility in 
secrecy.” What this really means is 
that those outside the organization 
do not know what the group does 
and therefore are unaware of the 
true breadth of its influence. 

Despite former members’ denial 

of the organization’s secrecy and 
sway, it is clear that Order holds 
power on campus. By its own 
account, Order was significantly 
involved in the creation of the 
Michigan Union and continues “to 
lead many vital projects that have 
made the University of Michigan 
the great public institution that 
it is today.” Prominent faculty 
and 
administration 
members 

have “occasionally” been invited 
to 
join 
the 
organization 
as 

honorary 
members, 
including 

an administrator in the Office of 
Institutional Equity in 2007. Many 
administrators have spoken at 
Order’s Leaders for Life conference, 
including University President Mark 
Schlissel and at least two regents. 
One former Daily staffer who was 
in Order cited the organization 
as a way to be privy to otherwise 
inaccessible information.

The 
Daily 
believes 
it 
is 

important to remain distinct from 
organizations friendly with the 
University’s administration, and 
Order fits this description. In this 
way, having a clear separation from 
Order and other such organizations 
aligns with The Daily’s existing 
policy prohibiting Daily staffers 
from 
holding 
membership 
in 

Central Student Government.

Furthermore, per The Daily’s 

bylaws and code of ethics, Daily 
staffers must “remain free of 
associations and activities that may 
compromise integrity or damage 
credibility.” Past Daily staffers 

have debated whether being a part 
of Order is a conflict of interest for 
the closeness that Order fosters 
between The Daily’s editors and 
student leaders of organizations 
that The Daily is supposed to report 
on. This year’s Management Desk 
has decided that it is. 

Membership in societies like 

Order places The Daily amid 
ongoing controversy and erodes 
our integrity. In the past, at least 
one Daily staffer has stepped 
down 
due 
to 
concerns 
over 

another’s membership in Order. 
Previous Daily editors who’ve 
held membership in Order have 
deferred editorial oversight of all 
articles relating to Order or naming 
members of Order. However, there 
is still unresolved gray area as 
The Daily publishes numerous 
articles on prominent student 
organizations, many of which have 
individuals who carry membership 
in the society.

Alumni of color 
call on Order of 
Angell to disband 
in Feb. 22 letter
Letter comes after current class sent 

email to all alum Feb. 17 asking input on 

“sunsetting” the organization

Order of Angell, an exclusive 

senior honor society oft-criticized 
for its legacy of racism and its 
elitism, is considering disbanding, 
according to an email sent to the 
society’s alumni obtained by The 
Michigan Daily. The email, sent by 
the current 2021 class of members 
on Feb. 17, says Order is seeking 
feedback from alumni on its value 
to campus, its changes over time and 
the ramifications of “sunsetting” 
the organization by not selecting 
another class. 

Order has suspended the process 

of tapping potential new members 
while 
it 
considers 
its 
future, 

according to the email. 

Order’s Class of 2021 — known as 

the “Pride” of 2021 — cites reasons 
“beyond their control” for “not 
start(ing) on a solid footing,” such 
as their smallest size relative to 
past classes, complications from the 
pandemic and being called racist 
over social media. 

“The conditions on campus 

have been difficult,” the email 
reads. “For example, dealing with 
being labeled as racists on social 
media, the internal push for further 
reforms, and the inability to engage 
in oral and in-person traditions 
have eroded confidence in selecting 
another Pride. Further volatility 
around campus standing, sponsor 
units, 
programs, 
agendas, 
and 

alumni engagement over our recent 
history also led to organizational 
fatigue.”

Alumni were asked in a Google 

form how Order has positively 
impacted campus or their lives, 
as well as what they had done to 
improve campus relations and 
promote a “more accurate narrative” 
of the organization.

Finally, they were asked: “What 

are your reactions, advice, or final 
Wise Words to the potential Last 
Pride Ever?”

On Tuesday morning, Order 

alumni of color released a letter 
to the current class calling on the 
group to disband or, alternatively, 

implement 
five 
main 
reforms. 

These reforms include making 
Order’s history known through 
“public 
truth-telling,” 
requiring 

racial justice education for current 
members and alumni and holding 
a “restorative-justice” process with 
Indigenous community members to 
mend the damage done by Order’s 
past appropriation of Native American 
symbols and traditions. 

The other reforms include having a 

transparent nomination and selection 
process, as well as developing 
organizational measures to limit 
or end engagement with alumni, 
particularly those before the 2006 
name change from Michigamua.

The letter, which has 21 signatures 

from current members, alumni and 
allies as of Tuesday afternoon, says 
both Order’s racist past and current 
treatment of members of color makes 
it necessary for the group to disband. 
The letter says that though Order 
claims to champion diversity and 
inclusion on the surface, “being a 
person of color in the organization 
was both laborious and harmful.”

“At the table on Monday nights, 

students of color often faced a 
hostile environment riddled with 
microaggressions 
and 
tokenism,” 

the letter reads. “Attempts to address 
these inequities were often met with 
silence at best and silencing at worst. 
The power within the organization 
was always with white students, 
backed by a powerful cadre of alumni 
who pulled strings within the Pride. 
Race-based aggression was assumed 
to have been limited to “the past,” 
even 
while 
racialized 
power 

dynamics continued to shape the 
day-to-day of the organization.”

The letter also says that students 

of color had to cross higher 
thresholds to be considered for 
acceptance into the society.

“Students of color have had to 

be exceptional in their leadership, 
while 
many 
non-marginalized 

students are granted seemingly 
automatic memberships due to their 
association with so-called “legacy” 
organizations,” the letter reads.

Ann Arbor City Council and public 
react to proposed rules to limit time
New resolution aims to improve discourse and accessibility of meetings

JULIA FORREST
Daily Staff Reporter

In an effort to improve 

discourse and ensure meetings 
are accessible to the public, 
the Ann Arbor City Council 
introduced a new resolution 
on Feb. 1 to amend Council 
Rules to have Council meetings 
end 
earlier, 
garnering 
both 

support and wariness from 
councilmembers. 
Since 
the 

council moved to conduct fully 
remote meetings during the 
COVID-19 pandemic, meetings 
have often gone into the early 
morning, sometimes past 1 a.m. 

The resolution also aims 

to limit negative interactions 
between councilmembers. 

On Feb. 1, City Council voted 

to approve the resolution R-21-
047, a Resolution to Approve 
Amendments to the Council 
Rules. It was brought up for 
a second time on Feb. 16 in 
a motion to reconsider its 
approval 
after 
issues 
were 

raised 
about 
the 
resolution 

potentially 
infringing 
on 

free speech. The motion to 
reconsider was approved. 

The 
resolution 
entails 

limiting 
discussion 
and 

debate on agenda items by 
reducing speaking times for 
councilmembers 
from 
three 

minutes 
down 
to 
two. 
An 

amendment in the resolution 
calls for councilmembers not to 
“assail, question, or impugn the 
integrity, character or motives 
of another Member” in or 
outside of council meetings.

Ann 
Arbor 
Mayor 

Christopher Taylor would act as 
the Presiding Officer over the 
meeting and would ultimately 
decide if a violation occurs. 

If the mayor deems that a 
violation occurred, he will give 
the councilmember who was 
spoken against two minutes 
of speaking time to defend 
themselves or say that the other 
councilmember is out of order. 

Councilmember Julie Grand, 

D-Ward 3, spoke at the Feb. 
1 meeting in support of the 
resolution, 
saying 
that 
the 

resolution will give power to 
councilmembers 
to 
defend 

themselves 
against 
attacks 

made on them without it taking 
up their limited speaking time. 
She has been on City Council 
since 2014 and said she hopes 
the resolution will help to 
improve 
councilmembers’ 

behavior.

“I believe the point of this 

is not to use it frequently and 
to actually keep us from going 
down in a rabbit hole where 
we’re defending one another,” 
Grand said at the meeting. “It 
really just gives that person, on 
hopefully a very rare occasion, 
the opportunity, if they have 
been clearly attacked to step in 
and get back in quickly to the 
work that we’ve been doing.”

Councilmember Lisa Disch, 

D-Ward 1, also spoke at the 
Feb. 
1 
meeting 
in 
support 

of 
the 
section 
allowing 

councilmembers 
to 
defend 

themselves 
against 
attacks 

that may imgun their integrity. 
Disch has been a member of 
City Council since Nov. 2020.

“This is not constraining 

anyone’s 
ability 
to 
express 

their opinion,” Disch said. “It 
is constraining their ability to 
promulgate 
negativity 
about 

this body and its individual 
members. 
And 
because 

statements 
that 
promulgate 

negativity 
about 
the 
body 

and it’s members compromise 
the dignity of this council, it 
compromises trustin council.” 

Councilmember 
Elizabeth 

Nelson, D-Ward 4, told The 
Daily she does not think the 
resolution would shorten the 
meeting because the length is 
based largely on the number 
of 
agenda 
items, 
not 
each 

individual speaking. She also 
worried about issues not being 
fully discussed and understood 
by various councilmembers in 
the interest of time. 

“I’m concerned about the 

idea that we want to reduce 
speaking time and that the 
suggestion is coming from new 
councilmembers right out of 
the gate,” Nelson said. “(They) 
are 
perhaps 
less 
informed 

about some of these issues, and 
I will say that when I first got 
on council, I benefited hearing 
from our colleagues who have 
more experience than me.”

Councilmember 
Jeff 

Hayner, D-Ward 1, said he also 
disapproves of the proposal 
and told The Michigan Daily 
he thinks the desire of new 
councilmembers 
to 
limit 

speaking time seems to be an 
overstep. 

“I didn’t see the need for the 

rules,” Hayner said. “And the 
rules were coming from a couple 
of councilmembers who’ve only 
been seated for a month and 
a half and so I thought it was 
a little presumptuous to start 
changing the rules.”

Hayner said the new rule 

would 
reduce 
the 
amount 

of time councilmembers are 
present to hear the concerns of 
their constituents. 

“It’s not like you’re reducing 

speaking 
time, 
what 
you’re 

reducing is my ability to speak 

on behalf of the 25,000 people 
I represent,” Hayner said. “I 
feel like you’re taking away 
from constituents your ability 
to express your constituents’ 
concerns.”

Brandon Dimcheff, a resident 

of Ward 4, spoke to The Daily 
in support of the resolution. 
He said he thinks the rule 
should be adopted to limit 
councilmembers from arguing 
with one another. 

“I feel like (the resolution) 

shouldn’t be that controversial,” 
Dimcheff said. “For me, I am 
definitely 
happy 
that 
(the 

resolution is) happening. People 
think it’s going to be weaponized 
against something, but I don’t 
see it. I think regardless of 
the situation, they should stop 
bickering at each other.” 

Dimcheff also said he thinks 

councilmembers’ time should 
be time-limited to shorten the 
total meeting times. 

“I think that this process is 

not intended to limit the scope 
of 
the 
grievance 
hearing,” 

Dimcheff said. “I don’t think 
anybody’s 
First 
Amendment 

rights are getting trampled.”

Dimcheff said he believes 

that the new rule would result 
in 
increased 
information 

density and quality of debate, 
as each councilmember would 
have to keep the information 
they are sharing concise. 

“If everyone comes prepared 

for the meeting (it will be) 
productive,” 
Dimcheff 
said. 

“Everyone would get up to 
speed individually and ask the 
best questions.”

Members of the Ann Arbor City Council are debating new rules to limit the length of meetings and to allow councilmembers to respond to direct verbal attacks.

ANN ARBOR


Additionally, 
separating 

Order membership from editing 
responsibility still hurts our ability to 
report on Order, as groups opposed 
to Order will nonetheless decline to 
talk to Daily reporters who are not in 
Order, which The Daily experienced 
as recently as 2019.

Importantly, 
knowing 
that 

journalism aims to “comfort the 
afflicted, afflict the comfortable,” 
Daily membership in Order hurts 
our ability to build trust with 
and amplify the perspectives of 
marginalized communities. This 
is given Order’s history of racism 
and harm, specifically in regards 
to its misuse of Indigenous rituals, 
language and artifacts.

The 
organization, 
previously 

named Michigamua, had exclusive 
access to the tower of the Michigan 
Union, a privilege unlike those 
given to any other student group. 
Since at least the 1970s, some U-M 
students have pushed back against 
Michigamua’s 
appropriation 
of 

Indigenous culture, and in 1989, 
the group agreed to eliminate all 
references to Indigenous culture 
except in its name.

But in 2000, activists in the 

Students 
of 
Color 
Coalition 

occupied 
Michigamua’s 
tower 

space for 37 days, finding that 
Michigamua’s 
meeting 
space 

had a “wigwam-like” design and 
exhibited 
Indigenous 
statues, 

headdresses 
and 
instruments. 

Michigamua also displayed photos 
of members taking part in initiation 
rites based on Indigenous rituals 
and 
gave 
members 
nicknames 

disrespecting Indigenous language. 
Past Michigamua/Order members 
well into 2012 have accused SCC of 
setting them up, despite extensive 
records suggesting the contrary. 
After sustained SCC protest, the 
University’s administration removed 
Michigamua from the Union tower. 

In 2007, Michigamua went 

through a series of reforms: it 
registered as an official student 
organization through the University, 
began to release its list of members 
and renamed itself as Order of 
Angell in honor of former University 
President James Burrill Angell — 
who founded the group in 1902 — 
against the Angell family’s wishes. 
Even today, though Order writes on 
its website that members “no longer 
participate in (Indigenous) rituals 
and actively condemn the practice,” 
the organization partially excuses its 
past as Michigamua by writing that 
“(a Native American theme) was a 
very common theme for many social 
clubs and literally millions of their 
members across the country” at the 
beginning of the 20th century. 

It is also noteworthy that during 

his tenure as University president, 
Angell negotiated the treaty that 
was the predecessor to the Chinese 
Exclusion Act and believed Chinese 
immigrants 
to 
the 
U.S. 
were 

inherently foreign and unassimilable.

In 
2019, 
multiple 
campus 

organizations 
condemned 

participation in Order due to the 
organization’s past appropriation of 
Indigenous culture and its elitism. 
These groups — including the United 
Asian 
American 
Organizations, 

La Casa and the Arab Student 
Association — announced policies 
that bar students who accept 
membership in the society from 
holding leadership positions within 
their organizations.

The Daily’s current leadership 

acknowledges and apologizes for 
our organization’s past involvement 
in Order. Since 1930, at least 58 Daily 
staffers have been a part of Order, 
very often The Daily’s Editor-in-
Chief or other high-ranking leaders. 
And since renaming itself as Order 
of Angell and attempting to distance 
itself from the term “secret society” in 
2007, Order has also used The Daily 
as a platform to publicize its member 
list, as recently as 2017. 

Though unable to make up for 

over 90 years of complicity with 

one letter from the editor or one 
Management Desk vote, The Daily’s 
current leadership wants to begin 
rectifying damage by dissociating 
formally from Order and other 
exclusive senior honor societies on 
campus. We believe The Daily’s 
platform should not be used to 
further the agendas of already-
powerful, historically problematic 
organizations such as Order.

This 
year’s 
leadership 
also 

recognizes that Michigan in Color, a 
section within The Daily by and for 
students of color, was the first entity 
within The Daily to condemn Order 
and “all other secret societies,” doing 
so in 2019. 

On Feb. 7, 2021, The Daily’s 

Management Desk approved the 
following provisional amendment to 
The Daily’s bylaws:

Because The Michigan Daily is 

committed to accountability and 
transparency, 
MDesk 
members 

will not join Order of Angell or 
any other exclusive senior honor 
society on campus or participate 
in programming run by these 
societies (i.e. Leaders for Life). A 
leader within The Daily partaking 
in a secretive group with a history 
of harm, including in any of their 
programming, 
does 
not 
align 

with our mission and core values. 
Participation in these societies, 
which value non-transparency over 
open engagement, directly goes 
against The Daily’s goal of being 
an organization that holds power 
responsible and elevates diverse 
narratives.

A staff-wide vote to confirm the 

provisional amendment will be held 
at the next all-staff assembly in April, 
per bylaw procedure.

Speaker 
Nancy 
Pelosi, 

D-Calif., announced Feb. 11 that 
a raise in the federal minimum 
wage to $15 would be included 
in the $1.9 trillion coronavirus 
relief bill. The bill, if passed by 
the House of Representatives, 
would be able to bypass the 
60-vote filibuster in the Senate 
through budget reconciliation 
and only requires a simple 
majority to be voted into law. 

However, 
the 
bill 
faces 

significant roadblocks in the 
Senate. With a 50-50 divided 
Senate, all 50 Senate Democrats 
and 
Vice 
President 
Kamala 

Harris would have to vote to 
enact the bill through budget 
reconciliation. 

The potential increase to the 

minimum wage, which would 
include gradual increases over a 
period of four years, would be the 
first time Congress has raised 
the minimum wage since 2009, 
where it was set to $7.25 per 
hour. In Michigan, the minimum 
wage is currently set at $9.65 per 
hour. A $15 per hour hike would 
represent a nearly 107% increase 
in the minimum wage on the 
federal level and a 55% increase 
for the state of Michigan.

Dr. Wally Hopp, University 

of 
Michigan 
Business 
and 

Engineering 
professor, 
said 

he has reservations about the 
unprecedented wage increase, 
especially during a pandemic. 
Hopp said he thinks Congress 
should wait until the economy 
has 
recovered 
to 
raise 
the 

minimum wage and to do so in a 
more phased approach than the 
current plan.

“If 
we 
go 
too 
suddenly 

absolutely, (there’s risks),” Hopp 
said. “Using a phased approach 
… we’re going to aim to get to 
$15 an hour, but we’re going 
to go on a pace that takes into 
account inflationary effects and 
unemployment.”

Engineering sophomore Nick 

Tran said he believes that the 
federal minimum wage should be 
higher than $15 per hour. Tran 
is from Seattle, a city that has 
already implemented a $15-per-
hour minimum wage, and said 
that the increased wages allowed 

him to save up money for college 
and put more money into the 
economy. 

“(The wage) allows me to 

support myself based on that 
salary,” Tran said. “If I was paid 
a lot less than that it would be 
somewhat more of a problem.”

It costs almost 32% less to 

live in Ann Arbor than it does to 
live in Seattle. Hopp said that he 
believed the role of the federal 
government is to set a bare 
minimum wage that could be 
increased gradually, but that the 
real increases should come at the 
state and local levels. 

“The minimum wage should 

be different for different parts 
of the country, and it is,” Hopp 
said. “I think there is a role 
for setting a bottom for the 
federal minimum wage … if we 
sort of push on the bottom of 
the wage scale a little bit, then 
it forces people like myself to 
make decisions to accommodate 
(employees).”

Hopp is also the owner of Great 

Harvest Bread Company in Lake 
Orion, Mich., and noted business 
owners have options other than 
layoffs when it came to balancing 
their budgets in the face of 
an increased minimum wage. 
These options, such as reduced 
hours and underemployment, 
are not counted in current 
unemployment metrics. 

“In order to stay in business at 

all, I really only have two levers: 
one is to increase prices and the 
other is to decrease hours,” Hopp 
said. “If I can’t be viable with 
adjustments to those two, then I 
go out of business.” 

James Wilhelm, the General 

Manager of Black Pearl on Main 
Street, spoke to the challenges 
his restaurant would encounter 
in the face of an increased 
minimum wage. Wilhelm said his 
business has thirteen employees 
making less than $15 per hour 
with approximately half of them 
as high school or college students. 

He said business has changed 

drastically over the course of 
the pandemic, and he had to 
temporarily consolidate positions 
to ensure safety and to cut costs. 
If the minimum wage were to 
be raised, those changes could 
become 
permanent, 
Wilhelm 

said. 

“Currently my servers are 

running their own food and 
bussing their own tables which 
is something pre-pandemic … we 
were paying (other) people to do,” 
Wilhelm said. “If the minimum 
wage goes up, there’s no way I 
could afford to pay the servers 
(that wage), plus pay a food 
runner, plus pay a busser.” 

If he were to give raises to 

employees to get them to the new 
minimum wage, Wilhelm said 
he would have to give equivalent 
raises to the rest of his staff to 
maintain the same hierarchy as 
before the wage increase. This 
increase would likely lead to him 
having to further consolidate 
employees or raise his prices. 

Wilhelm 
said 
he 
feels 

fortunate that his restaurant has 
larger ticket prices than other 
restaurants. 
Smaller, 
lower-

priced restaurants, he feared, 
wouldn’t be able to handle the 

increase nearly as well. 

“I hope (government officials) 

talk to real restaurant owners 
and actually get the opinions of 
people who have been doing this,” 
Wilhelm said. “My restaurant 
may 
survive, 
but 
it 
doesn’t 

mean all restaurants are going 
to survive … I worry about the 
smaller restaurants that aren’t as 
busy (as Black Pearl).” 

In contrast, Lauren Bloom, 

owner 
of 
Bløm 
Meadworks 

on 4th Avenue, said all of her 
employees currently make more 
than $15 per hour and that it was 
important for all of her employees 
to make a livable wage. Bloom 
said while owners of businesses 
and restaurants specifically are 
hurting right now, their servers 
and employees are hurting just as 
much. 

“I do understand that this is a 

challenging time for restaurant 
and service industry owners right 
now,” Bloom said. “But there’s 
never going to be a time that’s 
easy for business owners to make 
an increase in wages … but just as 
business owners are struggling, 
I think service employees are 
struggling too.” 

The federal bill also seeks to 

eliminate tip credit, which allows 
businesses to pay employees less 
than minimum wage if their 
income is subsidized through 
consumer tips. Phillis Engelbert 
owns The Lunch Room and 
Detroit Filling Station and said 
she is a staunch supporter of 
an increased minimum wage. 
Engelbert estimated that her 
employees make $17 per hour with 
tips, and if the tip credit were to 
be abolished, she would raise the 
price of products and reform the tip 

process. 

“Restaurants would have to 

figure out how to pass that price 
increase on to the consumers, 
there would be no other way to do 
it,” Engelbert said. “I think that 
would have to alter the way tipping 
happens … maybe tipping would 
go away altogether and customers 
would get charged the true cost of 
the product, including the true cost 
of the labor.” 

In 
early 
February, 
the 

nonpartisan 
Congressional 

Budget Office found that a $15 
minimum wage would increase 
unemployment 
by 
1.4 
million 

workers by 2025, but it also has the 
potential to lift 900,000 people out 
of poverty.

Some lost power, struggled to complete assignments due to extreme weather

Local businesses in Ann Arbor discuss impact of a 

potential federal $15 minimum wage policy

BUSINESS

Restaurant owners, U-M professor talk pros and cons of raising workers’ salaries amid pandemic, financial uncertainty

CARA JHANG/Daily

Ann Arbor restaurant owners and a U-M Business professor weighed in on how a potential federal $15 minimum wage policy would affect the local area.

GEORGE WEYKAMP

Daily Staff Reporter

With 
snowstorms 
raging 

across the country, University 
of 
Michigan 
students 
are 

grappling with bad weather 
conditions while taking virtual 
classes from across the country.

LSA junior Emery Hakim 

has been living with friends in 
an apartment on the University 
of Texas at Austin’s campus 
for the Winter 2021 semester. 
Texas has been particularly 
hard-hit 
by 
the 
weather, 

and Hakim said she and her 
roommates have not had water 
supply for the last few days. 
All classes and activities at 
UT-Austin, including virtual 
activities, were canceled due 
to the snowstorm. She said the 
grocery stores are not open and 
the roads are not clear, forcing 
Hakim and her roommates to 
conserve their food until the 
situation resolves. 

“We really did not expect for 

it to get this bad,” Hakim said. 
“Like we knew it was going to 
snow, and it snows all the time 
in Michigan, but now the entire 
city is shut down and classes 
(at 
UT-Austin) 
have 
been 

canceled.”

Engineering freshman Tom 

Sherman, on campus in Ann 
Arbor, was trying to get to 
his 8:30 a.m. class on North 
Campus on Tuesday and had to 
decide between taking the bus 
and riding his bike 2.6 miles. 

Sherman said the bus is cold 
anyway since the windows are 
kept open to reduce the spread 
of COVID-19, so he chose to 
bike. 

“That was a mistake because 

the sidewalks weren’t clear, 
and I fell off my bike,” Sherman 
said. “I guess in a normal year it 
would be nice to ride in a nice, 
warm bus and have the bus drop 
you right outside your building. 
I guess those aren’t luxuries we 
have this year.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Maryam 

Haltam is taking classes from 
her home in Plano, Texas. She 
said her house lost power for 
a couple of hours, causing her 
to join the widespread panic 
across the state.

“When we lost power, we 

started panicking and my dad 
started looking for hotels but 
they were all full,” Haltam said. 

Luckily, the power came 

back shortly after. Haltam also 
said she got to help some of her 
neighbors who had lost power 
and water.

“Our neighbors came over to 

have dinner with us since they 
had lost power for two days,” 
Haltam said. “I know a ton of 
people right now who do not 
have internet, cell service and 
are literally shivering in their 
houses trying to stay warm.”

Haltam said she is concerned 

about the state’s response to 
the snowstorm and how state 
leadership is navigating the 
crisis. 

“(Texas Gov.) Greg Abbott 

went live, and he was like, 
‘Guys it’s because we actually 
do need fossil fuels because 
renewable energy isn’t reliable,’ 
which isn’t true,” Haltam said. 
“Because the actual problem 
wasn’t that. It was the outdated 
power 
plants 
that 
cannot 

withstand the cold.”

Gov. 
Abbott 
and 
other 

Republican politicians falsely 
blamed frozen wind turbines as 
the root cause of the widespread 
power outages in Texas that left 
almost 3 million homes without 
power. Renewable energy only 
accounted for 13% of the power 
outages. Coal and gas energy 
sources accounted for double 
the amount of energy lost.

According 
to 
the 
Texas 

Tribune, the state also decided 
to not update their equipment 
to 
withstand 
harsh 
winter 

weather conditions per energy 
and policy experts. Many Texan 
politicians also chose to ignore 
warnings for extreme weather, 
citing they “prioritized the free 
market.”

Hakim said she lost power 

Wednesday afternoon and is 
concerned that she might not 
be able to submit a paper due on 
Friday without access to WiFi. 

“I’m pretty sure my professor 

will understand,” Hakim said. 
“But there’s a lot of chaotic 
energy here in this apartment 
right now.”

Nada Eldawy *Call me cleopatra the 

way I’ll conquer your heart <3 *Serial Netflix 
watcher *Love my cat more than I’ll love you: 
I had planned to start this piece by saying I 
downloaded Minder (Muslim Tinder) for 
purely journalistic purposes, a last-ditch 
effort to contribute to Love in Color before 
graduating as a chronically-single senior. But 
in all honesty, the application was on my phone 
weeks before the inspiration to write this piece 
struck. 

I never really felt like love was meant for 

me. Whether that’s a symptom of growing up 
without a huge Muslim community or just a 
product of insecurity, it was never really on my 
to-do list. However, like most people reading 
this, I found myself with all this time on my 
hands after quarantine, too much of which 
was spent aimlessly scrolling through my 
phone, before I realized — maybe halal dating 
could fill this gap. I downloaded Minder for 
a total of twenty minutes, including the time 
it took to create my profile. I barely began 
scrolling. One second, I saw a familiar face, 
the next second, the app was deleted off my 
phone and all traces of my profile’s existence 
were gone. Then I came across a Vice article 
of three people swiping right on Minder for 
a month, and before I even finished reading 
it, I knew — if I couldn’t stay on Minder for 
myself, I could at least do it under the guise of 
research. I forwarded the article to Maya, and 
the rest is history. 

The second time around, I was relaxed 

enough to appreciate all the app has to offer. 
From checking off your Islamic priorities, to 
getting straight to the point about willingness 
to relocate and marriage timing, your profile 
included all the no-nonsense communication 
to avoid games and keep things halal. While 
seeing marriage timelines of “less than 1 year” 
was terrifying and made me question my entire 
existence, it also gave me all the necessary 
information to get to know someone seriously 
without having to guess their intentions (and 
also very valid reasons for swiping left). If this 
was my Google Play review, I would give the 
Minder profile setup a 10/10 — and if you’re 
off-put by the reference to an Android, don’t 
worry. So were most of my Minder prospects.

The profiles themselves are a different 

story. I only made it a day on Minder before 
the guilt of my ulterior motive of writing this 
article ate me up, and I added it to my profile. I 
went for a cute and quirky, “Here for an article, 
but swipe right if you still want to chat!” Most 
people ignored the tidbit or asked about it in 
shock days after they reached out, leading me 
to believe that men don’t actually read what 
you write. Prove me wrong.

As for the profiles I saw, there was a severe 

lack of creativity. Along with the classic set of 
questions, Minder lets you choose three extra 
prompts to put on your profile. I cannot express 
the sheer amount of men who chose the 
question “What do you love about your mom?” 
and I’m still wrapping my head around how 
many of those answers were along the lines of 

“Everything, she’s an angel.” I’m unclear about 
whether the whole brown boy obsession with 
their mothers is sweet or alarming. There was 
also a huge demographic of non-Muslims just 
there with the motto, “‘If she’s white, don’t 
swipe right’ -me, 2019” (a direct quote from 
a fratty-looking white man). To be honest, 
I’m not sure what these self-proclaimed non-
Muslims expected to get out of Muslim dating, 
especially on a platform that exists explicitly to 
meet other Muslims. You could call it interest 
in other cultures and religions, but I prefer to 
call it what it is: fetishization. On the other end 
of the spectrum was the plea of, “Please no 
girls who are westernized — no makeup, must 
wear hijab, and not be a protester in the streets. 
If you support BLM or Gay Rights, please 
astaghfirullah just unmatch.” (This wasn’t 
supposed to be an exposé, but here we are). 
That, too, was a huge red flag. All too often I 
feel like my religiosity is written off because 
I don’t wear a hijab, so any profiles explicitly 
mentioning the hijab ate away at me bit by 
bit. But more than that, I was appalled how 
<Unnamed Muslim Man> expected women to 
swipe right on a person who explicitly opposed 
the most integral tenet of Islam: standing up 
for justice and helping the marginalized.

Every once in a while, I would come across 

a regular Muslim guy who was chill and woke, 
and we’d chat. I went through many of the 
same conversations consisting of someone 
asking me about my favorite Netflix original, 
me answering and conversations fizzling out 
naturally. A couple times I took conversations 
off the app, looking for the elusive “click,” and 
while I met some really great people, things 
never panned out for one reason or another. A 
couple people were just geographically too far 
away — a side-effect of me setting my profile 
to national to avoid only seeing people from 
our Muslim Students’ Association. One guy 
accused me of friend-zoning myself right off 
the bat (he wasn’t wrong).

Another blocked me after a pretty standard 

conversation, which took many days of 
friend-therapy for me to realize I hadn’t 

done anything wrong (That is a PSA: Saying 
you’re not interested is infinitely better than 
blocking someone). There was a time or two 
when someone checked all of the boxes, every 
single one, but the thought of spending my life 
with someone scared me so much I exited. 

Honestly, while I deleted Minder and do not 

foresee returning back to it in the near future, 
I do not regret the experience. By the end of 
my month-long trial, I no longer felt the urge 
to throw my phone at the wall when I saw 
someone I knew, and I gained some important 
communication skills in the process. Especially 
as a Muslim woman, it was valuable for me to 
destigmatize talking to people romantically. 
There is so much internalized judgement in 
the Muslim community surrounding dating, 
but as long as your intentions are pure, there is 
absolutely nothing wrong with getting to know 
someone or exploring your feelings. In another 
world where I was a bit more emotionally 
ready, who knows? I could’ve found my naseeb 
on Minder.

Maya Moka *Looking for my Arabic 

ting *If this doesn’t work out it was a dare 
*A life goal of mine: to go viral on TikTok: I 
consider myself a hopeless romantic. I grew 
up fantasizing about the Hallmark, cheesy 
relationships I saw on TV and dreaming of the 
day I could someday come to experience a love 
of my own, catapulted by a quirky meet-cute 
and followed by love letters and dancing in the 
rain. I blame Taylor Swift for a large portion 
of this. Being Arab and Muslim, however, 
and growing up with rigid expectations of 
what love looked like and the sequence of 
events that it should follow (meet someone, 
immediately get parents involved and start 
planning your future together), I never really 
saw that type of love in the cards for me. Still 
though, a girl could dream. It wasn’t until I 
grew up that I began to see things were not 
all black and white when it came to religion 
and dating, and that things could be done 
in a more modern way while still being kept 
halal (well, depending on who’s definition 
of “halal” we’re using). I still had, and to 

an extent have, crazy high expectations 
for love and hopeless romantic ideals, and 
the short-lived relationships I’ve had can 
definitely speak to that (If I’ve ever made 
you a playlist, you owe me a V-Day present). 
So, when the idea of a Muslim dating app 
came up, I was very reluctant at first because 
I had never considered meeting people in 
such a systematic way before. I liked love to 
be spontaneous, hitting you out of nowhere 
— on a study abroad or on a random night 
hanging out with a group of friends when you 
realize there might be a little something more 
between you and another person. But for the 
sake of quarantine, and writing this piece, 
I decided to give it a shot. Similar to Nada 
though, while I downloaded it under the guise 
of MiC content, I secretly hoped it would lead 
to something akin to real romance. 

I have had the app for about three months 

now. That’s three times longer than I originally 
planned to have it, and I hate to say it, but I 
have indeed not found love. I bought the three-
month premium membership because I had a 
crippling fear of being found by people I knew, 
which may stem from the irrational feeling 
that dating apps are a “last resort” when I know 
that’s not true and the sheer embarrassment of 
having to announce to the world that I’m single. 
I have found a friendship that could have maybe 
eventually turned into a relationship if he were 
more serious and if we didn’t live on opposite 
sides of the country. It started off great, but sort 
of fizzled out as things often do when someone 
stops putting in as much effort and it begins to 
feel like more trouble than it’s worth. In terms 
of Minder, it proved to me that I could indeed 
vibe with someone I met online and that I do 
have the capacity to sustain something with 
distance and delayed gratification if need be. 
It also dispelled the notion I had ingrained 
in myself that romance can’t be real if it has 
intentional, planned beginnings. In terms of 
guys my age, it proved the usual — diving in 
too quickly still isn’t the right move for me and 
pretty words often amount to zero actions or 
follow-through. 

I have also found several short-lived 

conversations that ended abruptly, a couple 
reasons to change my phone number, many 
cheesy bios, many weirdly hypersexual profile 
pictures and a much clearer picture of what I 
do and don’t want in a potential partner. And 
that counts for something, right?

What struck me the most was the 

discrepancy between the types of guys on 
the app and what they wanted, as well as how 
many men simply do not know how to talk to 
women — be it from shyness, impatience, not 
being serious about the app or whatever else. 
Some of them genuinely sounded like they 
had never talked to a woman in their entire 
life. Don’t get me wrong, my expectations 
for men on a dating app were not unrealistic, 
but where was the charisma and charm that 
Taylor Swift wrote hundreds of songs about? 
While some of my matches asked right off 
the bat if I would send nudes or was into 
something more “casual,” others brought 
up marriage within the first conversation. 
And then to echo Nada’s point, there was the 
outrageous laziness and lack of creativity in 
bios: About me: Just ask.;The key to my heart: 
food. What keeps me up at night: Netflix.

Thanks, Ali. That, coupled with your 

shirtless mirror selfie, really sold me. 
However, guys’ lazy bios and cringey photos 
are a running joke on most dating apps, so 
I definitely don’t chalk it up to religion or 
demographics. 

All in all, the experience was quite fun and 

interesting, and I appreciate Minder for what 
it is: A place for Muslims to get to know each 
other and clearly articulate what they want in 
a partner and relationship. It definitely plays a 
role in destigmatizing dating in our religion, 
and we deserve a place where we are the norm 
and not an exception or a fetish, but I think my 
overall disappointment is less about dating as 
a Muslim and more about dating apps more 
generally.

The L-word

Love in color: Minder edition

Pink happens to be my favorite color. 

Yet, I’m not that excited to see stores boast 
hues of pink and red as this time of year 
approaches. 

The l word didn’t exist for me until 

Valentine’s Day. As a kid, I was always 
excited by the prospect of Valentine’s: how 
lovely it is that we have a day dedicated to 
showing affection and care for those in our 
life. I dreamed of dramatic confessions, 
endless bouquets of roses and taking 
time to appreciate one another in typical 
romantic-comedy fashion. I believed that 
Valentine’s Day enabled people to be brave 
enough to say “the l word.”

Since then, I’ve been tying some sort 

of magic to the day. A couple of years ago, 
I would have been hoping for my own 
Patrick Verona to walk through the door. 

In high school, I might’ve thought about 
the boy in my geometry class sending me 
a candy-gram — anonymously of course — 
to jumpstart our high school sweethearts 
story. Last year, it would’ve been nice to 
grab Starbucks with someone. But you see, 
none of these aims ever came true. I was set 
up by the rom-com industry and Hallmark 
holiday that is Valentine’s Day. And before I 
knew it, “the l word,” whether in text or out 
loud, left me feeling sick. 

Recently, I’ve been thinking about why 

it’s so hard for me to even say “the l word.” 
Maybe because it’s sacred to me. Maybe 
because my mom never said it. Maybe 
because I’ve only seen it on a television 
screen. Maybe because I don’t think it 
belongs to me. Maybe it’s not even real. My 
friends and I often say that your perception 
of “the l word” is based on its presence 
around you. So, I’ve been searching for it. 
For love. Yes, love. In old photos, hand-me-
down clothes and in every fold of a love 

letter. And I can tell you, it’s real.

I see it when my mom silently leaves 

a plate of peeled mandarins on my desk. 
My uncles who fight to pay the bill at a 
restaurant. Friends that send each other 
songs that remind them of each other. 
Sending audio messages over texting. My 
favorite is when partners hold onto each 
other’s belongings so gently while the 
other is occupied. Plus, all the moments 
we can’t see or don’t know about. Like 
how you think of someone in your Duas 
(prayers). Or looking forward to their 
name under your notification bar. 

It’s not the break-out-in-song-and-

dance or Taylor Swift’s “Love Story” type 
of love that I’ve always envisioned, but it 
is love. While it’s nice to hear and see the 
word this Valentine’s Day, it doesn’t always 
have to be said aloud. Hidden amidst the 
pink hearts and bubble lettered l word, it’s 
the beautiful action of love that finds itself 
everywhere.

Valentine’s Day is stereotypical

My 
mother 
taught 
me, 
however 

unintentionally, about love through her life 
stories. She would tell me how when she was 
younger, her father would make extra money 
by fixing other people’s broken household 
appliances. She explained how when her 
birthday was approaching, he would pray that 
people’s appliances would break so he could 
afford to buy her a dress, even though she never 
expected anything. My mother showed me home 
videos she found from 1998. The videos consisted 
of my parents being completely and utterly 
mesmerized by my older sister, who was just one 
year old at the time, doing nothing besides sitting. 
My mother was the one who taught me that love 
is gentle, kind, patient and forgiving. She taught 
me that love has the ability to grow and change 
over time, so that it can become stronger. Love 
takes effort and is ongoing. 

With Valentine’s Day just around the corner, 

I can’t help but note the differences between 
mainstream society’s expression of love 
and my mother’s stories about love. Society 
dictates that men are frantically browsing 
stores, trying to figure out the perfect gift 
for their significant others. They search aisle 
after aisle, wondering if their wife or girlfriend 
would want chocolate, flowers or jewelry. Or 
maybe they want it all. Of course, the basic 
expectation is a nice dinner, so that has to 

happen regardless of what gift he chooses. 
These men consequently feel as though the 
pressure is on when it comes to Valentine’s Day. 

Much of society and the media claim that 

Valentine’s Day is the designated holiday 
to proclaim love and appreciation for the 
important people in our lives. In theory, 
Valentine’s Day seems like a wholesome way 
to express love, and giving gifts is a method 
of depicting your love on this holiday. Though 
society has largely accepted this, the holiday 
can easily turn into a performative, shallow 
way of appeasing your supposed loved one 
through materialistic items, which ultimately 
goes against everything I believe love stands 
for. It is just as important to celebrate your 
loved ones every single day in simple ways, 
whether that be through actions or words. 

Since when did the magnitude of love 

become quantifiable through gifts and how 
much someone spends? Love is not measured 
on a monetary scale. Celebrating a holiday 
that directly or indirectly supports this notion 
can and will never depict the amount of love 
someone has for another person, whether 
that person is a parent, sibling, friend or 
significant other. The modern meaning of 
love, as suggested by Valentine’s Day, is not the 
same love my mother taught me. When you 
really love someone, you show it on more than 
just one day. It is seen through actions rather 
than materials. This type of love appears to 
be absent from the stereotypical notion of 
Valentine’s Day.

In light of Valentine’s Day, our MiC editors 

asked us to each write a piece on love. I had 
to sit and think about what, even in all of 
my incredibly extensive experience and 
expertise, I could possibly draw from. But as 
I sat with myself in silly embarrassment and 
contemplation, I realized I would be lying if I 
said I hadn’t felt a tremendous amount of love 
this past year and even in the last few weeks. I 
have felt love even, and especially so, outside of 
any kind of romantic sense of the word. I have 
witnessed a love that transcends, that inspires 
… a love that I am immensely grateful for in this 
season.

At first, I was going to write about how 

the pandemic has taught me that love, in any 
and all of its forms, is essential. How it is a 
grounding force whose power and necessity I 
have recognized in this precise moment. How 
I have realized that having even just a handful 
of people, whether it be friends or family 
members, to love and gingerly receive love back 

from has been a crucial stake in my mental 
health and a truly supernatural constant 
amidst such uncertain times. 

I think it goes without saying that this 

past year has been extremely difficult and 
frightening and uneasy. But it really has been 
the loved ones surrounding me who have not 
only occupied my mind with matters other 
than a raging pandemic, but who have also 
filled each passing day with joy, comfort and 
someone or something to look forward to. 
I was going to write about how, despite the 
ambiguous shifting — and even expedited 
drifting — that this pandemic has caused in 
many of our relationships, the love you engage 
in with this handful of people, whoever they 
may be, is more than enough to carry you along.

But I have also realized that maybe this 

love is not necessarily a given. For myself, it 
has been the love from my family members, 
close friends and roommates that has helped 
me move forward despite such troubling 
times, not just begrudgingly so but even 
with an expectant joy. From gorging on Mr 
Spots’ Philly cheesesteaks in the Law Quad 
to talking late into the night around a warm 

bonfire to clinking thermoses full of hot cocoa 
on a snowy day, being able to hold onto these 
loved ones so closely and safely, I now realize 
is a privilege. For many others, this handful 
of people might be out of arm’s reach, or 
unavailable to see safely, or hurting or even 
gone. And I think it would be foolish and 
perhaps even entitled of me to assume that 
an abundance of love is currently accessible 
or guaranteed to everyone in today’s 
circumstances. 

What I have found this Valentine’s weekend 

is that love in the era of COVID-19 is not a 
given but rather a gift. And I should cherish it 
as such. I should consider the love that I have 
been so lucky to know during this pandemic as 
something that is incredibly precious, and in 
doing so appreciate my handful of loved ones in 
a way that is more frequent, more intentional 
and more vocal. I should call them more often, 
check up on them as they do for me and wish 
them good morning and good night. 

For Valentine’s Day 2021, perhaps I should 

simply unwrap, enjoy and reply to the love I 
have received this year.

The exploitative, violent nature of the capitalist 

system cultivates a culture of lovelessness. The hyper-
consumerism of late-capitalism –– with its damning 
demands for domination, rugged individualism and 
conformity –– permeates and toxifies our interpersonal 
relationships, making way for a severe drought of 
love. Simply put, love and capitalism cannot coexist. 
They’re incompatible. Only by reconnecting with our 
inner divinity and embracing radical love can we find 
ourselves one step closer to deconstructing oppressive 
structures on our path towards liberation. Liberation, 
however, is just one aspect of the journey, for love is our 
true destiny.

German social psychologist Erich Fromm, in his 

book “The Art of Loving,” discusses the ways in which 
love is the answer to the problem of human existence. 
He explains that having awareness of ourselves, of our 
fellow man and woman, of the future and the fact that 
we will inevitably die, prompts within us an awareness 
of our aloneness, or “separateness,” which is the source 
of all anxiety. 

In our attempts to overcome separateness, Fromm 

claims that we achieve (re)union by transcending 
our own life and finding at-onement (harmony). He 
also describes the ways that humankind has strived 
to prolong the anxiety of our separateness through 
inadequate means; from the orgiastic states of drugs, 
sexual desire or the accumulation of capital, we’ve seen 
time and time again an overwhelming tendency to try 
and alleviate our own experience of separateness. 

Much like author C.S. Lewis once stated, “All that 

we call human history — money, poverty, ambition, 
war, prostitution, classes, empires, slavery — [is] the 
long terrible story of man trying to find something 
other than God which will make him happy.” Whether 
we refer to it as God, higher consciousness, a higher 
power or whatever, there is truth in the fact that amid 
the mystery and miracle that is life, forces beyond our 
own seem to be guiding our spirit in the direction of 
interconnectedness, communion, fullness, wholeness 
or simply put, love. 

As Black feminist activist bell hooks remarks in 

her book “All About Love,” “my belief that God is love, 
love is everything, our true destiny — sustains me.” 
The Buddha defined the spiritual path to freedom as 
a practice characterized by the liberation of the heart 
which is love.. And as the Biblical passage 1 John 3:14 
states, “Anyone who does not know love remains in 
death.” Even in a culture distinguished by immense 
lovelessness, we all still seek to know love. 

But how do we know love, and what separates love 

from basic attraction? 

Martin Luther King Jr. sought to answer these 

questions in his 1967 speech “Beyond Vietnam: A Time 
to Break Silence” in which he said, “When I speak of 
love I am not speaking of some sentimental and weak 
response. I am speaking of that force which all of the 
great religions have seen as the supreme unifying 
principle of life. Love is somehow the key that unlocks 
the door which leads to ultimate reality. This Hindu-
Muslim-Christian-Jewish-Buddhist 
belief 
about 

ultimate reality is beautifully summed up in the first 
epistle of Saint John: ‘Let us love one another, for love 
is God and everyone that loveth is born of God and 
knoweth God.’”

Similarly, according to bell hooks, to know love we 

must “let go of our obsession with power and domination” 
which pervades Western society everywhere from our 
places of employment, religious institutions, political 
arenas, school systems and interpersonal relationships. 
We can let go of this obsession with power and 
domination by first understanding love as an active 
force. 

With this in mind, we can come to an understanding 

of the four basic elements, according to Fromm, that 
denote the active character of love, and exist in all forms 
of love: care, responsibility, respect and knowledge. 

Fromm cites care of love as “an active concern for 

the life and growth of that which we love.” He explains 
that we must labor in order to love, and that it requires 
dedicated work and effort in order to enhance the life of 
those we love.

He describes the responsibility of love as “being able 

and ready to respond.” In order to love, we have to be able 
to react to the needs of others and understand the necessity 
of putting others first –– before our own needs are met.

Fromm describes respect of love as not out of fear or 

awe, but “in accordance with the root of the word.” This 
means that respect is predicated on the basis of freedom 
and independence, or the absence of exploitation. If 
we’re in accordance with someone, that means we are 
aware of and conscious of their boundaries and rights 
as a human being. But to do this, we must know them.

Thus, the knowledge of love, or the knowing whom 

we love, is an absolute necessity. Fromm claims that 
“knowledge is empty if not motivated by concern.” He 
goes on to say that this knowledge has another aspect to 
it, and that by knowing someone else, we come further 
to uncovering the secrets inherent in the miracle of life 
itself. 

While we can only know ourselves to a limited extent, 

knowing others allows us the affirmation and assurance 
that we are not, in fact, alone in this universe. In this, 
Fromm concludes that the only way to “full knowledge” 
lies in the act of love.

It is only when we are taking action, or acting in 

some way that we are fully alive. As Christine Valters 
Paintner states, “our greatest creative act is living our 
daily lives.” What better way to live our lives than with 
love in our hearts and on our minds? As bell hooks 
asserts in her chapter on Divine Love, “To be fully 
alive is to act … I understand action to be any way that 
we can co-create reality with other beings and the 
Spirit. Action like a sacrament is the visible form of an 
invisible spirit, an outward manifestation of inward 
power.” 

By being critical and examining our own actions, we 

become better at outwardly putting forth this inward 
power inherent in all of us. By offering care, remaining 
responsible and respectful and having a desire to learn 
and to know, in all our interactions, we enrich not only 
others, but ourselves in the process. As we continue to 
strive through our actions to be fully alive, we embark 
on a lifelong trip towards our true destiny –– love.

To my talented Black Queens, 
The love I have for you is indescribable. I 

am so proud of all that you have accomplished. 
In the music industry, you continue to set the 
standard, raise the bar, dominate and make 
us proud. Flo Milli’s flow is unmatched, and 
Cardi always comes through with the dynamic 
visuals. JT and Caresha create a lifestyle all 
City Girls strive for, and Saweetie’s impeccable 
style and business hustle are not to be 
messed with. Megan’s rhymes and 
confidence make us all turn into 
Hot Girls. Nicki Minaj is the 
Rap Queen, and Doja’s style 
changes are so effortless. 
You ladies have followed 
in the footsteps of the 
greats including Queen 
Latifah, 
Lil’ 
Kim, 

Missy Elliot and Salt-
N-Pepa, and continue 
to dominate the rap 
game. 

But Black women 

aren’t just taking over 
rap 
music. 
They’re 

dominating R&B. Chloe x 
Halle are a power team that 
always comes through with the 
mesmerizing harmonies. Kehlani 
and Victoria Monét’s pens have me 
repeating verses two or three times over before 
I finish their songs, just to make sure I catch all 
of their clever word plays. H.E.R. and Solange’s 
moving messages produce emotions that are so 
powerful, and the combination of Jhené Aiko’s 
soft voice and her soothing instrumentals 
ringing through my ears creates such a magical 
and comforting experience. SZA’s lyrics always 
make me feel like she is speaking directly 
to me and describe exactly how I’m feeling. 
Jazmine’s strong voice is unmatched, and her 
timeless music is somehow nostalgic while also 
sounding fresh over a decade later. You ladies 

continue to prove that no one is touching the 
power of Black women and R&B. I am loving 
every millisecond of it.

You aren’t one-dimensional. No. You are 

multi-talented Queens that demand your 
worth be known in every aspect of society. 
Lizzo isn’t stuck in one musical genre –– my 
unapologetic queen can do them all. Rihanna 
is killing it in beauty, fashion, music and 
everything in between. Teyana Taylor is a 
singer, songwriter, actress, dancer and director; 
I mean, is there anything she can’t do? Beyoncé 
leaves me in awe 24/7. No words can describe 

her impact. With her impeccable music, 

vocals, films, music videos, jaw-

dropping performances and 

incomparable Ivy Park line, 

she has shown that girls 

have run the world for 
decades. You ladies are 
capable of so many 
great things, and you 
do it all so gracefully. 

People 
constantly 

compare you all, and 
I know it can be a lot. 
The haters persistently 
tell you that you don’t 
belong on the pedestals 
where you so firmly reside. 

They 
constantly 
body 

shame Lizzo and Megan. 

They call Beyoncé untalented. 

They created drama between Nicki 

and Cardi to distract from their immense 

talent. The disrespect Black women endure 
is hard and undeserved. But you continue to 
rise above the hate, shine, support one another 
and succeed. There are so many more Black 
women killing it; I can’t even name them all. 
You’ve changed my life more than you could 
ever know. The confidence boost I get every 
time I open Apple Music is unreal. You make 
me feel like I can accomplish anything just by 
being my unapologetic self. Everything about 
you is admirable, inspirational and flawless. I 
love you, and feel so lucky to be alive to witness 
such greatness. Keep killing it!

Love: our true destiny

The woman in the pale pink raincoat pulls 

me aside at TJ Maxx, and her voice drips 
with honey as she drawls that she absolutely 
loooves my sweater. My knee-jerk instinct is 
to reply, “Thanks, I love you!” 

I feel my cheeks burn, a crimson flush 

washing over my face as her thin eyebrows 
furrow in confusion. How bizarre must it be 
to hear those words from a stranger, uttered 
by anyone beyond your family, closest 
friends and significant other? But though I 
didn’t intend to let that slip, I mean it. I do 
love her.

I love her the same way I love the stout old 

man who owns the bakery on West Warren 
Avenue. During an unexpected blizzard in 
high school, my tire explodes on the way 
to class. After skidding aimlessly for a few 
minutes, rim grinding against icy concrete, I 
pull into an empty parking lot to inspect the 
car. As I stand shaking from the snow and 
scowling from the inconvenience, I hear a 
thickly-accented voice call out from behind 
me, “Come inside. It’s cold.”

Moments later, I am seated adjacent from 

Issam, the Palestinian bakery owner who 
has managed to serve me a plate of piping hot 
manaeesh only seconds after I was whisked 
into the store. We share the generous 
serving of bread, tugging warm tendrils of 
cheese behind it with each slice pulled, and 
exchange stories while I wait for my mother 
to call me back. We stumble through the 
conversation — with his broken English and 
my underdeveloped Arabic — and I learn 
about his brothers back home and his eldest 
daughter with whom I share a name.

He tells me that his bakery is a family, 

despite the lack of blood relations. I watch 
them work, smiling warmly and cracking 
jokes with every passing moment, and I 
think I see it too. He shoots me a toothy grin 
and slides a crumpled five-dollar bill to get 
my tire replaced. As we part ways, he offers 

me a can of Pepsi and a warmth that seems 
to thaw the bitter cold outside. Years later, I 
still owe him five dollars.

I love her the same way I love the 

eccentric Jimmy John’s employee who 
speaks to me in his self-proclaimed “alien 
language,” an endearing string of foreign 
noises 
indecipherable 
to 
Earthlings 

like me. Freshman year makes devoted 
regulars of my roommate and me, and 
we find ourselves stumbling into the 
tiny storefront every other night without 
fail, only to be greeted by our favorite 
night-shift worker. Soon, this becomes 
the highlight of our school year. With 
every anxiety-inducing all-nighter, we 
find solace in our Jimmy John’s visits. 
He makes us laugh so hard we forget our 
dreadful essays and exams, and soon the 
fluorescently-lit shop becomes our safe 
haven on campus. When he informs us 
that he’s quitting, we’re inconsolable, 
sobbing on the floor of our tiny room in the 
residence hall.

My friend Kyra and I pour our hearts 

into a farewell letter and present it to him 
on his last day. An unfamiliar ‘80s pop 
song croons over the speakers, and before 
we know it, the three of us are swaying 
back and forth in time with the music. We 
continue our awkward, wordless dance 
in the empty State Street sandwich shop 
before reluctantly saying goodbye to our 
favorite stranger, clutching our Turkey 
Toms like an unspoken parting gift. My 
other friend laughs at this story, asking 
how we could feel such grief over someone 
we hardly knew. I respond incredulously, 
“Because we love him!”

I love people recklessly and often. Passing 

strangers, 
Zoom 
classmates, 
cheerful 

Starbucks baristas: All great loves of my life 
that have come and gone, victims of my naive 
romanticization. I think it’s my favorite thing 
to do. A grave mistake we make is assuming 
that love is a finite, limited commodity — 
that we must cling to it with unrelenting 
persistence and grant it to a select few. 

These reservations around love, particularly 
the version we’re sold through Hallmark 
movies and Billboard Top 100 songs, are 
understandable. It feels malicious and 
elusive. It hides away from us. It taunts the 
single and lonely, and it convinces us that 
we’ll never acquire its joy. I’ve come to find 
that this version of love has blinded us to 
the real thing entirely. 

The real thing does not hide. It is not 

an extraordinary gift that few are blessed 
to find or receive; love is wherever you 
allow it to be. It’s not always clasped in 
the hand of a lover. No, sometimes it sings 
along to the hum of the engine when your 
friend drives you home after a long day, a 
gentle hymn only heard by the two of you. 
Sometimes it slips through the crack of the 
door held open by a stranger. Sometimes it 
is neatly folded in the pile of laundry your 
mother leaves on your bed, engulfed in 
the scent of fresh linen or woven into the 
stories your little sister tells her friends, 
the ones in which you are always the 
valiant superhero. Sometimes you don’t 
know you’ve planted it until you feel 
the tickle of its leaves on your neck, and 
sometimes you’ll never realize it was love. 
But it will fill someone up and unravel 
them, and they will bask in its warmth 
which endures for years. 

Love is wherever you find it, so if it slips 

between your lips, let it curl into your lungs 
and dance around like smoke, tingeing 
your skin pink. If it gives up a seat on the 
bus for you, nod in appreciation and rest 
your weary bones. If it lands at your feet 
in shards, make a mosaic and let the light 
refracted shine brighter than any burning 
hatred or dull indifference. 

I hope you learn to find love in all 

of those unexpected places: bakeries, 
sandwich shops or fleeting conversations. 
When you do, I hope you recognize it for 
what it is and allow yourself to either hold 
it close or pass it on. If you can’t find it 
there, I hope you at least find it in these 
words, knowing that I love you, stranger.

6 — Wednesday, February 24, 2021 

Last week, the Zell Visiting Writers 

Series, sponsored by the Helen Zell 
Writers’ Program, featured Marcelo 
Hernandez Castillo, a renowned poet 
and graduate of the University of 
Michigan who recently published his 
first memoir “Children of the Land.” 
During the event, which took place 
over Zoom, Castillo shared his work, 
talked about his career and answered 
questions for the public in an hour and 
a half long talk with faculty, staff and 
community members.

The meeting opened with a 

heartfelt introduction from Castillo’s 
editor, Sofia Groopman, who told 
us how the two had met. When 
she first read his poetry, she felt 
the fundamental trust that exists 
between a writer and their editor — an 
unnamable reliance as mysterious as 
it is strong; she knew she had to work 
with him.

Castillo possesses many laureates: 

He is a graduate of the University’s 
Master of Fine Arts program and 
is the first undocumented student 
to have done so. He is the founder 
of Undocupoets, a group of poets 
who support and advocate for other 
undocumented poets, and a published 
author. His award-winning poetry 
was also recently adapted into an 
opera and now most recently, his 
memoir was published. This latest 
work, which has been nominated 
for multiple awards and praised 
heavily, tells his story of being an 
undocumented immigrant crossing 
the border to becoming a celebrated 
modern poet.

Following his introduction, Castillo 

took some time to read a few excerpts 
from his work. Even though he sat 
alone in his room, his enthusiasm 
and charisma could be felt from miles 
away. Every pause in his reading, 
every extra emphasis in his voice, all 
served to illustrate the complex and 

vibrant picture that was his poetry. 
He began with the titular poem from 
his first book, “Cenzóntle.”

An emotional piece, it can only be 

summarized by a quote: 

“Because the bird flew before there 

was a word for flight years from now 
there will be a name for what you and 
I are doing.”

These were the opening lines to the 

poem — each line that followed grew 
more ethereal, packed with yearning, 
loss and emotions too complicated 
to name. Although the audience 
could not be viewed from Zoom’s 
speaker setup, it was clear they were 
enraptured (I know I was). Sometimes 
while watching a performer you can 
see their passion for their work in 
every move they make, and you know 
that this is what they were meant 
to do — this is how it felt listening to 
Castillo.

He then read an excerpt from his 

memoir: a chapter detailing what it 
was like to send his mother back to 
Mexico as she self-deported. Taking 
place 12 years after his father was also 
deported, Castillo and his siblings had 
to experience the pain and sorrow 
again, but this time in the new, 
bitter context of knowing they were 
sending their mother to be alone with 
her abusive husband and they may 
never be together as a family again. 
Beautifully written, it was clear from 
every twist and quiver of the words 
that this heart-wrenching story was 
written by a poet. 

Following his readings, Castillo 

entered a Q&A session with Nadia 
Mota, a current graduate student at 
the University. When asked about his 
graduate experience at the University, 
Castillo reminisced on the invaluable 
community he found in the writer’s 
program and has since returned to his 
alma mater as part of the Zell Visiting 
Writers Program to teach and advise 
current students on their writing.

On Feb. 9, HBO aired a new documentary 

directed by the renowned Sam Pollard, known 
for his work in the 1998 Academy Award-
nominated documentary “4 Little Girls.” The 
documentary, “Black Art: In the Absence of Light,” 
is an enlightening, 90-minute-long experience 
cultivated by the insight of artists ranging from 
Carrie Mae Weems to Kehinde Wiley, alongside 
other notable curators, collectors and scholars. It is 
an analysis of every stepping stone that has helped 
forge the path for Black artists and the emergence 
of Black American art within a predominantly 
white sphere.

The documentary centers its narrative around 

David C. Driskell’s 1976 exhibition “Two Centuries 
of Black American Art” at the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art, which compiled 200 years of art 
history using 63 carefully chosen artists. The event 
became a social-historical phenomenon by shining 
a light on the legacy of Black American artists. 

The discourse of “Black Art: In the Absence of 

Light” centers around institutions and their role in 
providing a sense of belonging. Museums, through 
their collection and exhibition practices, play a 
crucial part in the representation of the Black 
community, whose talent has long been ignored 
by mainstream American society. Art historian 
Maurice Berger, who gives his insight on the role 
of institutions throughout the film, exposes a 
clear problem of museum curation when he states 

that 85% of artists in the collections of American 
museums are white and that only a shocking 1.2% 
are Black. 

Driskell’s “Two Centuries” paved the way 

for the numerous movements, museums and 
exhibitions that emerged towards the end of the 
20th century, facilitating the introduction of Black 
art in the mainstream fine art sphere. However, it 
has certainly not been a smooth path. 

The film recalls “Harlem on my Mind,” the 

1968 exhibition showcased at the Metropolitan 
Museum of Art, as a hypocritical and wrongful 
display of “Black art.” While the show was centered 
around the African-American community, it 
showcased zero Black artists. This, alongside 
the emerging Civil Rights Movement, became 
an impetus for rethinking who decides which 
stories get told and in what way. In a sense, a lot of 
the reactionary exhibitions that came thereafter 
sought to take viewers out of their comfort zones 
and to challenge the previous conventionality of 
the art. 

This is exemplified in another exhibition the film 

calls attention to: “Black Male: Representations 
of Masculinity in Contemporary American Art” 
at the Whitney Museum of New York in 1994, 
which was curated by Thelma Golden, another 
important figure throughout the documentary. 
“‘Black Male,’” in the words of Kehinde Wiley, the 
artist behind former President Barack Obama’s 
portrait, “looked at the body as a sign of strength. 
It looked at masculinity as a sign of performance. It 
looked at femininity as an invention.”

This exhibition reshaped the meaning of 

Blackness and maleness in visual culture. In the 
documentary, images of the exhibit and cutouts of 
media critiques are shown, allowing the spectator 
to see how something so controversial had 
become liberating and illuminating for many but 
bewildering and perturbing to others. It’s amusing 
to read that what the press had to say echoed the 
exhibition’s original intention: a sort of artistic 
rebellion.

Black art has been there since the foundation 

of this nation: As Theaster Gates, the artist 
who concludes the film, said, “We are part of a 
continued renaissance — it’s been happening.” 
But now it’s time to make Black art part of the 
mainstream and the public eye. To become “great 
makers in the absence of light.”

After dissecting and deconstructing “Black Art: 

In the Absence of Light,” I appreciate the value of 
the whole and the importance of every featured 
voice — many of which I was unfamiliar with and 
others for whom my interest grew stronger. It is 
comforting to see Black art flourish and get its 
rightful recognition.

However, the documentary could be more 

succinct. In and of itself, it is a sort of exhibition. 
It deals with the impact that two generations of 
artists had on today’s artists and it acts as a general 
summary of what an arbitrary selection of Black 
artists have accomplished since. It is an analysis 
of various themes within a culture too frequently 
considered monolithic. 

Fans of HBO’s “Euphoria” may 

already be well-acquainted with the 
meditative rhythms of rising indie 
artist Ai Bendr — her debut single 
“Love Me Low” appeared in the most 
recent episode of the hit television 
show in January. The song now has 
over one million plays on Spotify and 
thousands on YouTube. 

For those who don’t yet know 

about Bendr, though, the introductory 
period happens quite quickly: Her 
soothing music bounces in between 
the walls like the warm hug we’ve all 
so desperately needed since this time 
last year. Give it a minute — maybe 
two — and you’re left with the oddly 
comforting sense that this woman 
must know you personally, for how 
else could a few notes be so exactly 
what you needed to hear?

Despite the intimacy of her sound, 

Bendr remains relatively unknown 
as an artist — but her story is actually 
quite interwoven with Michigan. 
Originally born in Australia, Bendr 
moved to Ann Arbor as a toddler, 
where she spent most of her childhood. 
She then went to boarding school in 
Massachusetts before returning to 
Lady Ann last fall when she started 
as a freshman in the School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance.

Bendr studies performing arts 

technology or, in her words, “basically 
music production.” This semester, 
she’s taking advantage of online 
classes by living in Los Angeles, 
meeting with producers and putting 
the content of her coursework to 
practical use. More recently, she 
signed with Interscope Records — her 
first-ever record label — and now has a 
year of exciting new releases planned 
under their management.

But most of the story behind “Love 

Me Low,” the track featured in HBO’s 
glittered show, starts long before the 
glamour of these dreams became a 
reality. 

“I was peeing when I came up with 

the tune,” Bendr told The Daily from 
her room in Los Angeles. She laughed 
at the memory, which perhaps feels 
quite distant after a year of such 
turbulence. She wrote the song last 
February, in the last weeks that she 
would spend at her boarding school 
before COVID-19 prematurely ended 
her senior year. At the time, she was in 
a relationship and thoroughly in love. 

“I was thinking about graduation 

and having to say goodbye to this 

person that I really loved,” Bendr said. 
“I was sad because I was happy, and 
I knew that in the future I would be 
sad.” 

In this sense, Bendr says, “Love 

Me Low” is essentially just a goodbye 
song. 

“It’s really a combination of this sad 

feeling because you’re letting go of this 
person that makes you so happy,” she 
said. “But you’re also just grateful that 
you were able to have them in the first 
place.” 

The song tells the story of a 

heartbreak that you see coming but do 
not try to stop: a feeling of melancholic 
happiness, of holding on to each 
moment because you know that soon, 
one of them will be the last. 

Bendr took this inspiration with 

her back home to Michigan and 
eventually recorded the single in her 
parents’ boiler room. “It was the best 
place for acoustics,” Bendr said. She 
lined the walls with couch cushions to 
avoid echo — now one million people 
on Spotify have heard the end result. 

Since then, a lot has changed. Press 

attention grew, and record labels came 
knocking. Bendr started making plans 
to move to Los Angeles in January, 
and more projects started falling into 
place. Then, one day last fall, she was 
sitting at her desk doing schoolwork 
when her phone buzzed with a 
notification from her producers. 

“They were like, ‘Hey can you give 

us a second, could you FaceTime us, 
because “Love Me Low” is going 
to be in “Euphoria,”’ ” Bendr said. 
She smiled at the memory of it all 
happening so quickly and simply. 

“I just kind of spammed them, I 

was like ‘wtf wtf — you can’t just say 
that.’ ” 

But it turned out to be just that 

simple: An agent who had appeared 
in Bendr’s Twitter direct messages 
a few months prior had been the 
one to facilitate the deal. A few 
weeks later, Bendr’s song echoed in 
the background of Jules’s (Hunter 
Schafer) bedroom toward the end of 
the second “Euphoria” special episode 
which was released on Jan. 22. 

The 
song’s 
placement 
feels 

especially fitting for Bendr; she still 
remembers watching the first season 
of “Euphoria” with the person who 
eventually inspired the “Love Me 
Low” tune. 

“It is so full circle,” she said. And 

from here she hopes that that circle 
will only grow.

The “First Time” Maybe a 

friend sends it to you with a little text 
saying “thought you’d like this!!” that 
instantly makes your chest balloon. 
Or maybe it comes up on a Spotify 
radio station or playlist. Perhaps it 
intrigues you from the depths of a 
book passage. It’s possible you choose 
it because the album art looked 
interesting. Maybe it means a lot 
instantly. Maybe it takes a second 
to settle in, finding the perfect way 
to inhabit your brain. Whatever the 
case, that song stays with you. For 
some reason, it’s really lodged in 
there. You can’t get it out of your head. 
The two of you are intertwined.

The Three Days Where You 

Play It A Million Times With your 
cell phone, you can take it anywhere. 

The song becomes the thing you most 
consistently spend time with. You’re 
working most of the time, but luckily 
you can concentrate while listening to 
music. You put it on in the background 
when you find time to hang out with 
friends. It accompanies you to the 
grocery store, people staring at you as 
you hum it in the aisles. You write the 
lyrics you like best on the back of your 
hand, and you listen to it seven times 
in a row. And each time, you seem to 
somehow like it better.

You Add It To Playlists What’s 

that emotion you’re feeling right 
now? You can’t quite figure it out. 
Your finger absentmindedly hovers 
on your mouse, as you look over 
your playlists. The song sits on your 
mind, and you decide it’s time to 
give it a home. But which one to 
add it to? These days, it feels like 
everything in your life is constantly 
moving fluidly into the next thing. 

There are no times to stop and 
breathe (except winter break, when 
everything stopped just a little 
too much). All you can do is take 
the things as they come and try to 
process them even as you’re moving 
on to the next. 

But this song, it just seems to fit into 

some niche. It clicks, somehow, God, 
you know that sounds cheesy. It’s 
when you’re adding it to the playlist 
that you usually listen to at 1 a.m. 
that you realize, maybe this is a sad 
song. How strange that this comes 
as a surprise. It’s not immediately 
apparent, you suppose, thinking 
about how maybe the touches of 
trumpets or drifting guitar strings 
hide the impact of the lyrics. This 
tune walks some strange line across 
your mind. You guess that you just 
haven’t really taken the time to figure 
out why that is. Why does the song’s 
balance appeal to you right now? 

What is it you love at the moment 
that makes this blend of notes and 
emotions make sense? What is it you 
need?

You Send It To Loved Ones 

It sounds almost like that song 
that played over and over that 
September when you and your 
best friend were 16 and she had her 
own car and gave you summery, 
open-windowed car rides home 
from school — it has the same bass 
line, maybe. You text it to her, and 
immediately she writes back that 
she misses you. What does quality 
time mean in a pandemic? What 
does it mean when you and your 
best friend go to different colleges? 
Sometimes, the best you can do is 
send a song you think she’d like and 
schedule a FaceTime. 

Jenny Slate (“Gifted”) cries a lot 

in “Obvious Child.” My sister makes 
fun of me because I have a running 
list of the best crying faces in film (at 
the top is Rooney Mara in “The Social 
Network”), and she reminds me that 
the ability to cry on camera doesn’t 
automatically meet the criteria for a 
good actor. 

One of my biggest pet peeves, 

actually, is when actors drool for their 
big crying scene, making a show out 
of the spittle and snot running down 
their face, like they’re silently hoping 
this scene makes the cut for their Best 
Supporting Actor reel. I think it’s the 
pendulum swinging back from when 
vaudeville-era stars would have single 
tears rolling down their faces so as not 
to muddle their makeup or when that 
one director told Jessica Alba to “cry 
pretty.” Either way, it just feels really 
performative — when we’re watching 
a film, we’re not supposed to see the 
actor performing, we’re just supposed 
to see the character existing.

Slate plays the lead Donna in 

Gillian Robespierre’s (“Landline”) 
directorial debut, and she doesn’t ugly 
cry. We follow her as she stumbles her 
way through a new relationship and 
pregnancy after being cheated on by 
her now ex-boyfriend. She cries so 
much — when she’s waiting outside 
her ex’s house, when she’s at an 
abortion clinic, when she’s lying in her 
mother’s bed — and, because of that, 
it’s become as natural as scratching an 
itch or tucking her hair behind her ear.

Donna doesn’t ugly cry because 

she’s grieving her relationship. The 
tears roll down her face easily, with 
no restraint left, because she’s just 
living through these awful things that 
keep happening. She doesn’t have the 
strength anymore to hold back tears 
when she lost her job, got cheated on 
and didn’t know how she was going to 
pay for her abortion.

I love how even though this movie 

is a romantic comedy, at times it feels 
deeply sad. I love how they portray 
the arduous, non-linear process of 
repairing Donna’s life: visiting family, 
drinking, 
performing 
stand-up 

comedy. I love how winter is an integral 
part of the backdrop: Valentine’s Day 
ironically falling on the coldest day 
of the year, running out of a bar into a 
freezing night looking for someone, 

listening to the rattle of your old 
radiator. It’s my comfort movie when 
I’m depressed and miss the sun.

There’s this scene where her boss 

says, “Change is good, Donna.” And 
she says, “Man, that’s like, the rudest 
thing you’ve ever said to me.”

It’s just an iconic quarter-life crisis 

film.

We need more sad romances with 

happy endings. For all the silent crying 
and worrying in this movie, it’s still so, 
so romantic. 

I have this theory that pre-coital 

scenes (and post-coital, like the Magic 
8 Ball scene in “Good Will Hunting”) 
could be better utilized in film, and 
not just a cut to candles as soon as they 
start making out to keep the PG rating 
in a sexless Marvel movie. Donna and 
Max, her one-night stand (Jake Lacy, 
“High Fidelity”), have an impromptu 
drunken dance scene to Paul Simon’s 
“The Obvious Child,” and it’s so 
heartbreakingly beautiful that it 
breaks my heart. They’re goofy and 
visibly sweaty and laughing into each 
kiss — and it’s just so tender it makes 
me insane.

While romantic scenes like when 

Max warms up Donna’s butter for 
her are really incredible, the greatest 
part of “Obvious Child” is its deep 
understanding and appreciation of 
love in all its forms. Platonic, familial, 
self-love — it means so much to me 
to see Donna have a nice dinner with 
her parents or put her head in her 
roommate’s lap. And Richard Kind 
(“Inside Out”) is a treasure as Donna’s 
father. When he says, “Creative energy 
can come from the lowest point in 
your life,” it just makes me wish he 
was my dad. I rewatched it recently, 
and I forgot how funny it is, actually. 
So much of it feels so poignant to 
me, even when Max brings flowers 
to the abortion clinic like some kind 
of Georgia O’Keeffe joke, or their 
conversation about naming blizzards 
because “That’s what it’s gonna be like 
from now on.” 

When I feel really defeatist about 

life, it means a lot to hear Donna’s 
deeply confessional jokes about her 
vagina. I just hold on to the thought 
that you can cry over the low hum 
of medical equipment during a 
procedure, then wrap yourself in a 
blanket, hold your partner’s hand and 
wait to heal.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Wednesday, February 24, 2021 — 7

We began by talking about our 

dreams in abstraction, the intuition 
that webs our subconscious. Indigo 
Sparke, 
the 
Australian 
singer-

songwriter, expertly builds a world 
of her own in her music — dreamlike, 
filled with coursing energies and 
space to let yourself expand. 

“I think I’ll like, wake up and … I’m 

still living in the motion and some sort 
of dream space,” she mused in a Zoom 
interview with The Daily. Her dreams 
infiltrate every inch of her new record, 
Echo. The beginning of consciousness 
when waking can be so hard to 
pinpoint. Sometimes, upon arising 
from a deep sleep, there is a feeling, 
just for a bit, that you’ve come into a 
very real world that is not your own. 
This otherworldliness is prominent in 
her music.

Sometimes, 
though, 
Sparke’s 

dreams give her a better sense of 
connection with her life. These 
dreams are “psychic,” even as she 
laughs at herself for using the word. 
They give her a sense of what is to 
come, preparing her for a future she 
can face calmly. We discussed why 
this inner sense of prophecy might be 
figuring its delicate way into her sleep. 

“I think actually, everybody has 

the capacity to tune into an energy 
field where the information is existing 
already,” she said quietly. “And I think 
everybody has access to a certain level 
of intuition. And it’s just about refining 
that tool and tuning into something 
that is so inherently what it means to 

be a human being in a world where 
we’re living in subtle energy.” 

This sort of mindfulness requires 

the trifecta of body, mind and 
environment to carefully be in tune. 
Her music walks this line. At the 
best of times, this personal balance 
is difficult to manage; in periods of 
suffering, it can feel like the three are 
falling out of sync in a way that can 
never be repaired.

Oh, these periods of suffering. 

Sparke’s haunting, gentle voice paints 
a fragile veneer over the chasms of 
emotion her new work covers. It 
draws deeply from the spirit of the 
desert. The stretching of skies found 
in such a landscape was a necessity 
for her at the moment of writing. It 
was an environment she could fill 
her lungs with, something she could 
merge with and allow to envelop her. 
She described herself as surrendering 
to her environment, as though this 
was something everyone did, as if 
everyone had as easy of a time letting 
go of the boundaries of their body and 
becoming a part of a whole. It is a gift, 
a way to contribute to the experience 
of everything around you.

This sense of everything, a holistic 

view of the world, falls right in line 
with Sparke’s philosophy. She believes 
that “everything is inherently linked 
and there is a greater energy,” pivoting 
toward a discussion of spirituality 
in her music. An old man named 
God who lives in the clouds is not in 
her periphery. Faith of any kind is 
a tricky thing to capture with your 
own two hands in a definitive way; 
it is something that she thinks of as 
lived, instead of conjured in the mind. 

Your outside reflects your inside, 
both in your actions of living a sacred 
life and in dealing with your own 
traumas. “The Urgency of Change,” a 
book by Jiddu Krishnamurti she told 
me about, handles this subject well, 
addressing, in Sparke’s words, how we 
are “always seeing externally … what 
is unresolved internally.”

“I feel like I’m full of minefields that 

I’m constantly trying to understand,” 
she finished, although not hopelessly. 
This self-searching process is part 
of the privilege of life, and one she 
pursues in so many different ways.

I asked: “When do you feel most 

at peace with yourself and the world 
around you?” She instantly recalled 
the desert and the ocean, open spaces 
that allow room for her to be. Another 
instance, perhaps, of using our 
external and internal environments 
to tap into each other. This sense of 
peace is something that comes and 
goes for her, just like for the rest of us; 
what motivates her music and her life 
are the themes of love and grief. 

“What is it to heal?” she asked, 

a question coming some months 
after the breakup of a meaningful 
relationship. “I feel that you can’t have 
the healing without the breaking in 
some way.” 

Breaking yourself down is a process 

that feels like it must have some 
absolute end, but really, it is a cyclical 
one. These senses of love and grief have 
inhabited her life ever since she was a 
kid, and they take their rightful places 
in her music. The gentle humming of 
guitars and plaintive lilt of her voice 
gives a sweetness to any tears produced 
over the course of her life. 

Tears of love, tears of change. On 

the cover of her new album, her long 
blonde hair blows across her face, with 
her eyes peering out of the shadows 
it creates. This shadow has since 
been removed, as she hacked off her 
hair until it was shoulder-length in a 
cathartic process that included half 
an hour of sobbing. It involved ridding 
herself of the male gaze, as she let go of 
the trait she had been complimented 
on since childhood. 

“It didn’t take away from how I saw 

myself in my beauty at all,” Sparke told 
me. It allowed her to define her beauty 
for herself, instead of having others 
try to do it for her.

“Someone told me that hair holds 

trauma,” she said, building up to a 
laugh. “And I was like, ‘Oh my God, 
I’ve got like, 17 years on me.’” 

Not only a physical change, the 

cutting of hair allowed something to 
click between mind and body. All of a 
sudden, there came a connection.

“Once I chopped it off, I actually 

realized that in a place in a home 
deeper in myself than I even knew 
was there, my values were actually 
intact in some way,” Sparke said. 
She described her core values as 
consistency, 
vulnerability 
and 

honesty, pausing between each word, 
turning it over on her tongue and in 
her mind as she checked to make sure 
it truly matched her feelings. 

Consistency is a virtue in love and 

relationships of any kind, she decided. 
This safe harbor of return assuages 
the physical stress she feels upon 
change. That doesn’t mean impulses 
can’t figure their way in, though. 
“Dog Bark Echo,” one of the tracks 
on her new album, was recorded 

spontaneously a while back, when 
living with fellow artists in a castle in 
Italy. There is a magic there that she 
keeps with her. It is magic of a very 
personal kind; Sparke is keenly herself 
at all times, in conversations and in 
songs, even when it bruises and hurts.

Vulnerability 
and 
honesty 

are woven into the fabric of her 
music — her work is a healing scab, 
acknowledging that its recovery is 
impermanent and that the skin will 
eventually be broken again. She lays 
herself bare not only in the words 
she sings but in how she sings them, 
offering them as an expression of her 
truest self. She makes this music for 
what she’s going through, she told 
me, never appeasing the listener.

Full of gender, 
free from designation

BY MELANIE TAYLOR, STATEMENT CORRESPONDENT

M

y name is Melanie Renee Tay-
lor, and my pronouns are she/
they. These are your two requi-

site pieces of information needed when ad-
dressing, discussing or otherwise perceiving 
me. And as intrinsic as they both are to my 
identity, even they aren’t set in stone. Maybe 
someday I’ll change my name. It was only 
very recently that I adopted new pronouns. 
Yet, when I introduce myself as such, it paints 
a stagnant picture that allows you to begin to 
make evaluations and assumptions about the 
person I am.

However, there’s something you may not 

have inferred from that introduction: I love 
language. I love how it provides an outlet for 
explanation and innovation, putting words to 
concepts which would otherwise only exist 
in the mind. I love the way language ebbs and 
flows with the human experience, both influ-
encing and being influenced by the introduc-
tion of new cultural norms. But language, like 
all other manifestations of culture, can only 
attempt to estimate its nuances and complexi-
ties. One example of this phenomenon can be 
found in gendered pronouns.

Studies show that Gen Z has the largest 

proportion of publicly queer-identifying peo-
ple of any generation to date. Over the past 
few years, and particularly during the lock-
downs, young people across the country have 
convened with their peers and taken to social 
media, mulling over exactly what kinds of 
gender identity fit them. Along with that ex-
ploration comes a logistical debate over how 
our language can adapt to these newly emerg-
ing demographics.

Gendered pronouns are often inconve-

nient. They imbue gender identity with for-
mality and rigidity where it’s not always natu-
ral. We have to put our identity in a box as a 
function of our language. Gendered pronouns 
are also a great source for enforcement of the 
existing patriarchal status quo, exacerbating 
certain stigmas against those who can’t or 
won’t conform.

Many widely-used languages — includ-

ing Korean, Afrikaans and more — function 
without gendered pronouns as they exist in 
English. And for many of the languages that 
treat pronouns like English does, activists 
across the world are working toward increas-
ing the use of gender-neutral language in their 
respective cultures and countries. Some have 
argued that the solution lies in transitioning 
to gender-neutral language entirely. But in my 
experience, acceptance and normalization of 
gender neutrality is not always the answer.

Many people find empowerment in gen-

dered pronouns. It can be very affirming for 
someone who transitioned from male to fe-
male or vice versa to “pass” as their desired 
binary gender, and when they are “misgen-
dered” — either through use of the opposite 
binary pronouns or through a reductionist 
use of they/them — that constitutes a micro-
aggression. The way I see it, ubiquitous use of 
agender pronouns is comparable to attempt-
ing a “colorblind” approach to race; it’s tone 
deaf and ignores all of the intricacies that gen-
der identity has to offer.

Stuck between a rock and a hard place, 

gender identity continues to be muddled and 
misunderstood. Perhaps the only thing we 
can really do is stop taking it so seriously.

***
We’ve established that the nuances of gen-

der cannot be described through a catalog of 
identity monikers. Gender encompasses emo-
tion, expression, personality, perspective. In a 
recent Tiktok trend, creators emphasized this 
complexity by attempting to describe their 
gender by likening it to some object or experi-
ence.

In keeping with the trend, LSA junior Syd 

Lio Riley (they/them) said in a phone inter-
view with The Daily that they’d describe 
their gender as “when an LSA freshman tells 
you their major, and it’s like, ‘Maybe that’s it, 

but probably not.’ And it’s too 
soon for anybody to actually 
tell.”

Riley — who often uses he/

him pronouns as well — also 
compared their gender to 
Bernie Sanders’ tumultuous 
political orientation.

“I am a man in the same 

way that Bernie Sanders is a 
communist,” Riley said. “Like 
I’m definitely not, but I’m 
close enough to let you think 
that. And the more removed 
from gender and transness 
that you get, the more likely 
that you are to assume me of 
being (a man).”

Riley said that in this sense, 

their identity is often least un-
derstood by cisgender people 
who haven’t had to grapple 
with any inaccuracies pro-
duced by a binary conception 
of gender. Thus, it is more 
difficult for cisgender people 
to understand the nuances of 
Riley’s identity.

Art & Design junior Xochi 

Sanchez (she/her) — who in 
a phone interview with The 
Daily described her gender 
as “a raccoon that you’ve be-
friended” — believes that it’s 
“intuitive” for queer people 
to understand the nuances of 
their peers’ gender whereas 
cisgender people may not. 
Without an organic introduc-
tion to gender politics, such as 
the lived experience of ques-
tioning your own gender, it 
becomes much more difficult 
to empathize with what that 
looks like for another person.

“I think I’m lucky,” Sanchez said. “Nearly 

every person I’m friends with is trans and/or 
nonbinary, so they just all know.”

For LSA junior Parker Kherig (ze/hir), 

confusing people with hir gender is half 
the fun of it. Kherig, whose self-described 
gender is “the bundt cake from ‘My Big Fat 
Greek Wedding’ with the little flower in it,” 
said in a phone interview with The Daily 
that ze find joy in subverting gender expec-
tations.

“I feel like (spite) really colors my gen-

der,” Kherig said. “Because so much of my 
gender expression is just, ‘How f---ing con-
fusing can I look? How absolutely perplex-
ing can I present myself to the world?’”

Kherig said hir first experience question-

ing hir gender happened at a very young 
age. One night when Kherig was in elemen-
tary school, ze were intrigued by something 
happening on hir block and attempted to go 
out to investigate in hir pajamas. Ze made 
it down the stairs only to be stopped at the 
door by hir father.

“He was like, ‘You can’t go outside in 

that,’” Kherig said, “Because it says some-
thing about my morals if me — a seven-year-
old — went outside in my pink princess 
Barbie nightgown. And that was the point 
where I was like, ‘What is this bullshit?’”

For Riley, that realization surfaced a bit 

later in life. Riley began to wonder about 
their gender when they were in high school 
because they had been dating someone who 
identified as gender fluid. At first, Riley 
said, it was difficult to understand.

“I never felt like I fit into that expecta-

tion of what gender fluidity was supposed 
to be,” Riley said. “But as soon as I kind of 
unlearned the idea of gender needing to 
look any particular way, I started identify-
ing as nonbinary.” 

Sanchez also took to questioning her 

gender identity late in high school, but it 

wasn’t really until two years later when she 
transferred to the University of Michigan 
that Sanchez started feeling comfortable 
in her identity. She met a group of queer 
people also in the School of Art & Design 
and habitually attended the school’s events 
hosted by trans artists whom she showed 
her work to and solicited advice from.

“That ended up being the breaking point 

where it was like, ‘You know what, it’s been 
over two years,’” Sanchez said. “I need to 
actually get this out in the open and start 
working on it.”

It was then that Sanchez started coming 

out to her family and others “in little bits.” 
And that’s the thing about coming out — it’s 
not some one-and-done task that can be ac-
complished in a single, swift motion.

Contrary to how it may seem in film or 

television, coming out is a long and labori-
ous process that never really ends. So long 
as they continue to have new life experienc-
es and expand their group of friends and ac-
quaintances, queer people will always have 
someone else they need to come out to.
F

or example, I attend upwards of 10 
Zoom meetings every week. Because 
my account, like most students, is 

hosted by the University, I am unable to per-
manently alter my name on the platform. 
That means that if I want it to list my pro-
nouns next to my name, I have to manually 
go in and make that change every single time 
I enter a Zoom call. When you have to come 
out once every two hours, it starts to get ex-
hausting.

“It’s become such a formal way of des-

ignating not only what gender are you, but 
who in the space is trans,” Riley said. “And 
I have to choose then what pronouns I put 
next to my name — if I do at all — and then as 
soon as I do, what statement does that make 
about who I am in that space?”

Riley goes on to note an added compli-

cation: Our identities aren’t static. Not only 

do they evolve over the course of our lives, 
but they also switch from context to context. 
Sometimes we may choose not to update the 
pronouns in our name because in that par-
ticular setting, expressing one’s nonbinary 
identity doesn’t feel safe or welcome.

Kherig described this code-switching as a 

defense mechanism used by queer people in 
situations where they may not feel safe ex-
pressing their whole or truest identity.

“I think there are plenty of times where 

the real thing, the big thing, the beautiful 
thing is just too much for people,” Kherig 
said. “So there are definitely ways that I have 
learned to make myself smaller, to protect 
myself in certain spaces. And I think that’s 
something that most people have to do.”

Kherig also noted a sense of shame preva-

lent in the queer community which arises 
when someone simplifies themselves to con-
form in unsafe situations. To Kherig, that 
shame is neither fair nor necessary.

“We have to make ourselves smaller for 

other people to protect ourselves,” Kherig 
said. “And you should never feel ashamed 
of that. Because you are preserving yourself, 
you’re preserving your peace. And you de-
serve to survive.”

Riley said that it is difficult for a third par-

ty to ever be fully cued into a nonbinary or 
trans peer’s entire gender identity.

“One thing that would be really useful 

for non-trans and cis folks to understand 
is that they will never be able to fully get it 
right,” Riley said. “And I think that’s a really 
hard thing for people to sit with, especially if 
you’re a person who cares about other peo-
ple and affirms other people.”

There are so many factors influencing 

how a person’s gender manifests at any given 
moment that it’s not feasible to evaluate it all 
from a distance.

April 12, 2020
What does a pandemic look like? 
F

or me, it’s a monotony of days 
peppered with bouts of depres-
sion in the apartment my grand-

parents pay for and waves of overwhelm-
ing guilt and helplessness. Neither are 
productive emotions in a pandemic. 
There are also good days, where the sun 
is out and my coffee tastes just right, and 
I remember that this is only temporary. 
I live alone, though a friend lives up-
stairs. I never thought I’d be grateful to 
be an introvert. The sadness of the world 
sometimes feels far away, accessible only 
through Twitter headlines or 
the New York Times articles my 
mother sends me … hourly. Oth-
er times it feels like it’s moved 
into my apartment, stitched into 
my clothes and seated across 
the table. It feels as if we’re 
under- and overreacting at the 
same time. A pandemic smells 
like solitude, an endless supply 
of lavender candles lingering in 
the corners of my apartment. It 
tastes like too much whiskey, 
consumed alone. 

In warmer times, a pandem-

ic can sound like the crack of 
dice hitting the plywood tables 
punctuating Ann Arbor’s yards 
— the fraternity house across 
the street has been playing for 
what seems like weeks. Last 
night, my friend called a noise 
complaint on them. Sometimes 
life feels normal. I remember a 
March afternoon my freshman 
year of college, when I left my 
dorm for class and froze outside 
the building door. What words 
are adequate to describe feeling 
fresh sunshine on your skin af-
ter weeks of studying and exist-
ing under fluorescent lighting 
and the smothering dullness 
of the world? Sunshine meant 
frat boys outside in their yards, 
shirtless (always) and Weezer 
spilling through the speakers. On an is-
land in the sun, we’ll be playing and hav-
ing fun, and it makes me feel so fine, the 
speakers say. 

In my early quarantine days, I siphoned 

as much sun as I could from my front 
yard. I pulled a plastic yellow chair into 
the yard to do my homework and yelled 
over, “Hey, can you turn the music up?” I 
pointed upward in the air with my thumb. 
A barefoot guy in blue shorts and abs I can 
count from across the street yelled “Oh, 
you want it up? You got it!” Maybe it’s the 
2020 “college” version of the orchestra 
that played as the Titanic went down, and 
I’ll take what I can get. 

A pandemic also sounds like the Spoti-

fy playlist I’ve been building called “quar-
antine, baby!” I only put songs on it that 
make me happy or want to dance or smile. 
That’s what we all need more of, anyway. 
Every couple hours I turn up the music 
and dance around my apartment, because 
in a pandemic you need endorphins. 
I’m grateful no one is around to see this 
abomination. Then again, this is because 
no one is around. My homework and un-
watched lectures linger on my chipped, 
paint-covered brown desk, watching me 
twirl around the room. Right as I trip into 
the coffee table, my inbox dings with an-
other email from my astronomy professor. 

As usual, he’s massacred it with his caps-
lock addiction, and I forward the message 
on a one-way trip to the trash.

I call my mom several times a day — 

imagine that, 16-year-old Annie! Pandem-
ics make you see how much you need 
other people. I make a quarantine playl-
ist for her too. I listen to it as I walk the 
streets around my house, filled with emp-
ty porches and the beginnings of spring 
flowers. “Annie!” I hear someone’s voice, 
but I can’t see them. “Annie!” It’s my 
friend Hannah — we spent six weeks in 
the New Hampshire woods together last 
spring, sharing poems, hammocks and 
secrets. She’s standing at the top of the 

stairs to her porch, I’m 10 feet back on the 
sidewalk. It’s awkward.

“Am I allowed to hug you?” I ask. 
“I mean, I’m fine with it,” she laughs. 

It’s a clumsy hug, our arms bumping as we 
find our footing together. In retrospect, I 
probably should have stayed on the side-
walk, but it’s human nature to crave con-
nection. 

Sometimes a pandemic is more work. 

My dad stayed near his job in Chicago 
throughout March, organizing huge or-
ders of equipment for field hospitals in 
McCormick Place from the Army Corps 
of Engineers. He forwards us the plans: 
“AWARDED ACF CONTRACTS,” the 
email attachment reads. Eight projects, 
equaling 9,693 beds, to be completed in 
27 days, at most. He writes in the email, 
“Kind of surreal, let’s hope they build 
them and are not needed.” My dad spends 
his Saturdays at the delivery dock so his 
shipping guys can stay home. Luckily, I’m 
at the age where I can appreciate his em-
pathy for his employees instead of com-
plaining that he’s not at home. 

But a month into the pandemic, it be-

came clear how different it looked for 
those on opposite ends of the financial se-
curity spectrum. A pandemic looks a bil-
lion different ways, and most of them are 
not as privileged as mine. New York Gov. 

Andrew Cuomo called COVID-19 “the 
great equalizer,” but this evidently could 
not be farther from the truth. Maybe in 
just plain human terms, it’s accurate. 
We’re all dealing with something, and it 
will only go away if we all do our part. But 
our losses are by no means equal. I think 
about this a lot. 

More than 16 million Americans have 

applied for unemployment. I was laid 
off. My co-workers have houses, kids 
and bills to pay. People are displaced, los-
ing income, losing benefits, losing family 
members and friends. The Guardian de-
clared that minority and at-risk groups 
are, of course, disproportionately af-

fected: “It’s a racial justice issue,” their 
headlines read. Celebrities on Twitter 
are learning what it means to be an ac-
tual parent, without the help of nannies, 
while single mothers watch incredulous-
ly. Small businesses rely on GoFundMes 
to survive. A Navy captain pleaded with 
his superiors for more resources for his 
ship in order to combat COVID-19. After 
his firing, he tested positive for the virus. 
What about people without running wa-
ter to wash their hands? People with pre-
existing conditions? Those who have lost 
health insurance? Those with insufficient 
health care? Single parents? People expe-
riencing homelessness? The list goes on. 

I once wrote a letter to my future chil-

dren for a nonfiction writing class. At the 
time, Australia was on fire. “It’s 2020, and 
right now it feels like the world is much 
more bad than good, I wrote. I hope you 
are more confident about your world than 
I am with mine.” But now it just seems 
like the world is burning everywhere. If 
only I’d know what was ahead. A national 
election, a pandemic, climate change, ri-
ots at the Capitol. The list goes on. 

In the letter I’d also written that “poli-

tics has become morality and I don’t 
know how to navigate that.” My old 
housemate, Julia, and I had a late night 
conversation from our respective sides of 

Lake Michigan. 

“I think a lot of my sadness is coming 

from seeing the way the U.S. is handling 
this and realizing the state of our coun-
try,” I told Julia. “Like, I lost a lot of faith 
and pride in my country when Trump 
was elected but seeing doctors and nurses 
beg for supplies is just another level that 
I wasn’t prepared for.” It’s silent on the 
other end. Who has an answer to that? 

Finally, she said, “I’m doing what is 

perceived as normal, and inside I’m kind 
of screaming.” Maybe in a pandemic, 
that’s all you can do. 

February 18, 2021
What does a pandemic look like? 

It looks like six half-full or-

ange bottles, compounding in a 
cupboard as my psychiatrist tin-
kers with the chemicals my brain 
thinks it can do without. 

It looks like falling in love — a 

few nervous phone calls and our 
first date on the porch with the 
windows open. We’re both stub-
born and eager and dive hungrily 
into learning each other. 

It looks like my mom with her 

drawer full of KN95s, a stack of 
writing portfolios to grade, a cafe 
au lait, a glass of wine, her run-
ning shoes and a round of greet-
ings as her students enter the 
Zoom. 

It looks like a wedding in my 

grandma’s backyard, tables of 
pizza and salads spaced out by 
tiki torches and apprehension. 
My cousin and her husband say 
“I do” on my aunt’s porch, framed 
by July sunflowers from a friend’s 
garden. Two families mingle to-
gether next to Lake Michigan as 
the sun sets.

There are some better days 

— even a few nights spent in 
tents. Nov. 9, when Joe Biden of-
ficially won the election. People 
cascaded into Chicago’s streets, 
dancing and singing, befriending 
strangers, feeling an unfamiliar 

warmth in the air. The day my friends 
and I cooked shakshuka next to Lake 
Superior. Moving into a new apartment, 
a two-bedroom this time, with a small 
army of plants, my best friend and her 
dog. The day my mom got vaccinated. 
All the dinners, walks, games, naps and 
breaks taken outside. 

Young people are entrenched in a 

mental health crisis (no need to read 
the article, a scroll through Twitter or 
TikTok will give a good indication), Go-
FundMe has ballooned into America’s 
insurance policy and climate change and 
government oversight joined forces to 
trample Texas. 

I’ve always wanted to believe that 

those with means will help those with-
out, and in the past year I’ve watched 
both brilliant displays of empathy and 
soul-crushing acts of hatred and selfish-
ness. “It’s 2021, and right now it feels like 
the world is much more bad than good.”

Today, Ann Arbor is quiet, except for 

the brawling snow plows and the salt 
crunching under my boots. I force myself 
to walk down to the Huron River a few 
times a week; I lay on the ice and watch 
clouds skid across the sky. The handful 
of people milling around the river nod 
slightly to each other. We’re all looking 
to be seen.

Scattered 
quarantine thoughts 
from a terrible dancer

statement

“

I’m a nice guy,” crooned Neil, 
the 
sloppy, 
cocaine-addicted 

aspiring novelist, to the woman 

he’d just attempted to sexually as-
sault, Carey Mulligan’s Cassandra. 
She eyes him now knowing other-
wise. “I’m a nice guy.” Neil repeated, 
desperation creeping into his voice. 

Cassandra smiled. “You keep say-

ing that. You’re not as rare as you 
think. You know how I know? Be-
cause every week, I go to a club, and 
every week, I act like I’m too drunk 
to stand. And every f---ing week, a 
nice guy like you comes over to see if 
I’m okay. You want to f--- me still?”

“I’m a nice guy.” 
Though I watched “Promising 

Young Woman” on pay-per-view in 
my bed by myself, I could still hear 
the collective eye roll from women 
everywhere at this line. I could al-
most as clearly hear the gears turn-
ing in the head of every man who’d 
heard the line and thought back to a 
time he’d crooned it too. 

I remember hearing it in high 

school. I got B’s DM almost a month 
after he’d been accused of sexually 
assaulting a girl I knew as a friend of a 
friend of a friend. This news shocked 
me as I thought back to running lines 
with him in a practice room for a play 
we were both auditioning for. Slight-
ly chubby, awkwardly kind and will-
ing to run lines with the freshman 
girl who didn’t know anyone there, 
he seemed like such a … nice guy. He 
promised. He promised that he was 
a nice guy in the DM, then he asked 
me on a date. He was probably lone-
ly after he’d been kicked out of the 
show based on the allegations, but I 
knew better. This was no nice guy. 
I blocked him from my Instagram, 
along with the story from my mind.

I heard this line again a few years 

later. S was my new friend, why 
shouldn’t I have thought of him as 
a nice guy? I was crewing a show he 
was starring in, and he sure seemed 
like one in the beginning. We’d get 
coffee after rehearsals. He’d always 
offer to drive and pay. He showered 

me with compliments, even men-
tioning me in his bio in the playbill. 
Swoon. And so, I had no reason to 
think otherwise until his texts be-
gan to get more frequent and more 
demanding, and I complained to my 
friends that he was beginning to get 
a little … clingy? 

I felt the first red flag when I told 

him I’d lost my virginity and he re-
sponded, “How about you seriously 
consider not f---ing someone unless 
you’re in a committed relationship 
with them.” First, this is verbatim, 
I still have the screenshots. Second, 
this is some seriously demented pa-
triarchal nonsense. 

Another red flag sprung up when 

he pointed out that I’d stopped re-
sponding as much as I used to and 
that he had “separation anxiety” 
when I ignored him. “I’m working,” 
I lied. “Are you lying to me?” he re-
sponded. Yikes. He wasn’t wrong, 
but he clearly couldn’t take a hint.

His response? “Don’t ignore me. 

I’m a nice guy.”

I brushed it off and showed the 

texts to my friends. We ended up 
laughing about it. I would never have 
admitted it to myself at the time, 
but the attention seemed harmless. 
The red flags are obvious now, but 
at the time I was almost flattered to 
have someone so obsessed with me. 
It became a little less funny when 
he started texting my friends beg-
ging them for my address because he 
wanted to drop off my usual coffee 
order and apologize for being clingy. 
I then told him I didn’t want to be 
friends anymore. It was even less 
funny when he told one of our mutu-
al friends, “Honestly, the only thing 
that would fix our friendship would 
be a gun.” 

So much for a nice guy. Isn’t it fun-

ny how that works?

From my experience with guys, 

this is how it usually goes: Guys only 
have to promise they’re nice guys in 
the event they prove themselves to be 
otherwise. A nice guy is a term used 
“to describe someone who believes 
himself to possess genuine ‘nice guy’ 
characteristics, even though he ac-
tually may not, and who uses acts of 
friendship and basic social etiquette 
with the unstated aim of progressing 
to a romantic or sexual relationship.” 
Sounds about right, especially when 
you add the context that it’s often 
used as a cover for violent or misogy-
nistic behavior directed at women.

After everything I’ve gathered 

from my experiences with men, I re-
quest but one thing of the male popu-
lation: Be a nice guy and mean it. We 
want to give you the benefit of the 
doubt. Women are not prudes or “So-
cial Justice Warriors” or “unf---able 
b-tches” for not putting out or not 
wanting to go home with you or put-
ting you in the “friend-zone” or not 
letting you hold our drinks. We’ve 
just heard way too many stories 
about what happens to girls who do. 
The threat of gender-based violence 
is always in the back of our minds, 
and we go out of our way to avoid 
making ourselves a target. We’ll give 
the guy we’re not very interested in 
our phone number at the bar because 
we don’t know how angry he’ll get 
if we don’t. On the other end of the 
spectrum, we aren’t sluts or whores 
or whatever other terms of endear-
ment you want to call us to your bud-
dies when we do choose to do some-
thing with you. Assuming consent 
was present, we think you’re a nice 
guy. Don’t screw it up.

People who date guys, I commend 

you for having to deal with not one 
but two pandemics in these troubling 
times: COVID-19 and the nearly as 
deadly “Nice Guy” epidemic. Accord-
ing to a study published by the United

W

hen I was in kindergarten, I had 
mandatory Quiet Time in my 
room every day after school for an 

hour. I could play with my toys or look at books 
or color, but I was not to disturb my mom un-
less I needed something important.

Needless to say, I was not a big fan of Quiet 

Time when the policy was first put into place, 
and I protested. Loudly. And daily. But my 
mother is an incredibly smart woman, and she 
quickly figured out how to get me to cooperate. 

One fall afternoon, having finished my 

after-school snack, I trudged up to my room, 
complaining all the way upstairs. When I got 
into my room, I found a shiny new book wait-
ing for me at the end of my bed. It was a kids’ 
biography of Abigail Adams, whose name had 
instantly earned her my admiration when we 
learned about the Revolutionary War. (Re-
member the ladies!) 

Suddenly, Quiet Time didn’t seem all that 

bad. Usually, I spent most of the hour bemoan-
ing the drudgery my own mother was subjecting 
me to and checking the clock every few minutes. 
But that day, I barely noticed as the once-dreaded 
hour ticked by. I was absorbed in my new book. 

My mom must have noticed my relative lack 

of complaints when I came back downstairs 
an hour later. Because after that, for as long as 
I had after-school Quiet Time, every so often, 
she would leave a book or two — sometimes 
new, sometimes from the library — waiting for 
me on my bed.

As I got older (and relatively easier to man-

age), Quiet Time was no longer required. But 
by then, I had become a full-blown bookworm. 
My favorite day of the week was the day my 
mom drove me to our local library after school. 
I had the route from my school to the library 
memorized before I could even ride a bike.

I would tumble out of the car the second my 

mom parked and skipped across the shaded 
parking lot. I’d bounced down the stairs to the 
children’s section, where I’d promptly buried 
myself in the stacks. I’d stay there browsing 
happily until it was time to go, at which point 
my mom invariably had to help me carry my mas-
sive pile of books upstairs to the checkout desk. 

When we got home, my mom helped me 

carry my books upstairs and organize them in a 
precarious tower on my nightstand. I picked up 
the book I was most excited about and, if I was 
left unbothered, would spend the rest of the af-
ternoon reading until it was time for dinner. 

Somewhere between 15 and 21, my love 

for reading lost that intensity, that excitement. 
Math homework started getting harder. TV 
started getting more interesting. My friends 
and I were suddenly allowed to go places on 
our own — and sure, they were just the mall 
and the local Starbucks, but our newfound 
freedom was thrilling. 

On top of that, the intense pressure I felt to 

fit in meant I was terrified of being judged for 
my reading choices. I’d rarely pick up books I 
hadn’t already heard my peers talking about, 
and if I did, I wouldn’t mention it. It was just 
another reason to read less.

I still read books, of course. I even still read 

not-required-for-English-class books, and I 
kept an eye on the news. When I had the time, 
I’d pick up a murder mystery or whatever novel 
all friends were talking about at the time. But 
always something light and easy; always some-
thing that wouldn’t require too much brain-
power; always something I could easily put 
down if I had to.

Because of that, it wasn’t the same. 
I no longer read for the sheer excitement of 

it. I no longer devoured books because I just 
had to know what happened next. The amount 
of schoolwork and extracurriculars I had left 
me with few afternoons to spend reading, and 
very little mental energy to tear through a book 
at breakneck speed. So even though I read 
books I liked — books I loved, even — the old 
excitement was reduced to a few glimmers.

Most of those patterns I started forming in 

middle and high school became cemented in 
college. Once I found my friends at school, I 
was less scared about being judged, but it was 
midterms by then, and the only thing I had time 
for was school. As much as I loved reading for 
fun, I just didn’t have the time — or the brain-
power — for it. 

Then COVID-19 happened, and suddenly, I 

had all kinds of time. 

It started in early May, just after I had fin-

ished classes. My mom and some of her friends 
had planned a mother-daughter Netflix Party 
to watch “Clueless,” the gloriously 90’s teen-
movie adaptation of Jane Austen’s “Emma,” 
which I had recently started reading as a way 
to wind down during finals. 

A love for Austen is one of many things 

I inherited from my mother, who excitedly 
watched the entire BBC “Pride and Prejudice” 
series with me when I decided to read it fresh-
man year of high school. So this was an excit-
ing moment: We could watch an adaptation of 
“Emma” (a movie we both already loved) while 
I was reading it. 

Suddenly, I was right back to my middle 

school reading habits. I spent afternoons read-
ing on our porch. I fell asleep with images of 
Regency flirtations dancing in my head. I fin-
ished the remaining three-quarters of the book 
in four days. 

The old flame was reignited. I tore through 

books last summer, just for the fun of it. I read 
whatever I felt like reading: murder mysteries 
and spy thrillers, gritty true crime and cheesy 
rom-coms, high literature and history and 
Harry Potter for the 100th time. And suddenly, 
reading was fun in a way it hadn’t been in years. 

A quick scroll through Twitter confirmed 

that I wasn’t the only one feeling like this. My feed 
was full of nostalgia for the elementary school 
Scholastic Book Fair, book recommendations and 
people like myself who had gone back to their 
middle school reading habits in quarantine. 

For me, quarantine also took the pressure off 

reading because I stopped feeling like I had to be 
reading something impressive or cool or interest-
ing whenever anyone asked. I stopped caring what 
other people thought about my book du jour. 

N

ot caring what people thought about 
my current read made an incredible 
difference. I sourced book recom-

mendations from family and friends and social 
media. Eventually, I made a Goodreads account 
to track what I was reading and find more sug-
gestions. It quickly became my favorite In-
ternet rabbit hole — say what you will about 
robots monitoring our lives, but the algorithm 
on that website is very, very accurate, and I am 
thankful for that. 

It’s part of a larger trend we saw during 

quarantine: allowing ourselves to indulge in 
self-care to escape the literal hellscape outside. 
Along with countless skincare TikToks and 
plenty of online shopping, reading fun books 
became a way for me to treat myself to some-
thing uplifting or escapist. 

Of course, as the summer progressed, read-

ing became so much more than just an escape. 
As the Black Lives Matter movement rightly 
took its place in the forefront of our conscious-
ness, we got a necessary reminder about the 
importance of reading diverse authors and ed-
ucating ourselves, and leaders in the movement 
recommended books like Ta-Nehisi Coates’ 
“Between the World and Me” and Ibram X. Ken-
di’s “How to Be an Antiracist.” Mike Gustafson, 
who co-owns Literati Bookstore in downtown 
Ann Arbor with his wife, and Richard Retyi, the 
director of communications and outreach for 
the Ann Arbor District Library, both told me in 
interviews last week that antiracist literature 
has been in more demand ever since.

It’s an adjustment, to be sure — these are 

not light, easy reads. But honestly, at this point, 
what’s one more adjustment? We’ve switched 
to online classes, contactless takeout meals and 
countless Zoom holidays. Switching up what 
we’re reading is a small, but important addition 
to the massive change the last year has brought. 

Lockdown has also been incredibly difficult 

for local libraries. The Ann Arbor District Li-
brary hasn’t opened its doors in almost a year. 
But AADL is committed to serving the commu-
nity, so they’ve adapted. Story hours, book clubs 
and film discussions were all moved online. Li-
brarians are available for shelf service to find 
what their patrons are looking for. Checkout is 

now done contactless in the library’s lobby or 
online, as AADL works to make audiobooks 
and e-books, which are in more demand than 
ever, as widely accessible as possible.

And it’s working. 
I spoke with Retyi last week, and his pride in 

the work AADL is doing to help the community 
through the pandemic was audible over the phone. 

“We are circulating about 60% of the 

amount of material that we were when we 
were fully open,” Retyi said. “It’s remarkable 
— to have two-thirds of our stuff still going out 
even though nobody can browse. It’s huge. The 
volume has been awesome.”

Indie bookstores are also struggling. It was 

true before the pandemic, thanks to Amazon 
and Jeff Bezos’ correct assumption that giving 
me a coupon for a book on my to-read list will, 
in fact, make me buy the book online rather than 
going to the store. But the pandemic has made it 
even harder. It’s no longer safe to just pop in and 
browse your local bookstore, so that two-day 
Prime shipping looks better and better. 

So indie bookstores have adapted, too. My 

beloved Capitol Hill Books at home in D.C. 
is doing appointments where you can have 
the entire store to yourself (a literal dream) to 
browse safely for an hour and custom-book 
grab bags. Literati has expanded its online aup 
and virtual events. They’ve even put their sig-
nature Public Typewriter online.

It hasn’t been easy. But like the library, indie 

bookstores are finding their niche in this pan-
demic. Gustafson told me more about what 
indie bookstores are doing to stay afloat during 
the pandemic over email, and though it’s been 
challenging, Gustafson’s love for and pride in 
his work is clear. 

Still though, attending online events and 

picking up books curbside is a far cry from af-
ternoons spent studying, browsing and drink-
ing coffee in Literati or getting lost in the stacks 
at the Dawn Treader. It’s only a “semblance” 
of that pre-pandemic haven, Gustafson says.

In the midst of a pandemic, 

a refuge in reading

T

he first time someone referred 
to me as an alien, I laughed. I 
did not have a big, bald head. 

My skin wasn’t green and my eyes, 
while on the large side, looked quite 
normal to me. The word “alien” 
followed me around for years. In 
America, because of my immigration 
status, I was as extraterrestrial as Zoe 
Saldana in “Avatar.” 

Therefore, when confronted with 

the question, “What does an alien 
look like?” in a freshman seminar, my 
answer was, “they look a bit like us.”

According to the Oxford English 

Dictionary, the meaning “foreigner” 
has been associated with the word 
“alien” as early as the 1380s. The 
first citation for the science-fiction 
meaning was in 1929, in the Wonder 
Stories magazine. It appears that we 
had been using the word “alien” to 
refer to foreigners long before we used 
it to refer to extraterrestrial creatures. 
Consequently, we can conclude that 
when the English-speaking world first 
wrote about Martians in space, they 
imagined these Martians to be similar 
to foreigners. Alien means the same 
today as it did in the 1380s — it is used 
to differentiate between people based 
on race and borders. It is a pejorative 
term that strips immigrants of their 
humanity and their rights on the basis 
of such humanity. 

In 
18th 
and 
19th 
century 

humanitarianism, 
autopsies 
were 

popularized. They made it clear 
that on the inside, our bodies are 

extremely similar, if not all the same. 
It is one of the reasons humanitarian 
aid exists today. We realize, above all, 
we are human. According to Thomas 
Laqueur, “the humanitarian narrative 
relies on the personal body, not only 
as the locus of pain but also as the 
common bond between those who 
suffer and those who would help.” 

But the act of referring to a person 

as an “alien” clashes with the notion 
of humanity. Identifying someone 
as “alien” disregards all of their 
other forms of identity and simply 
classifies them as “the other.” It 
is an unnecessary word that only 
serves the purpose of differentiating 
between people on the basis of race, 
ethnicity and nationality. It is used to 
deepen the divide between “us” and 
“them,” and it perpetuates racism and 
problematic stereotypes. 

In his article about the social 

and legal construction of “aliens,” 
Kevin Johnson writes: “the concept 
of the alien helps to reinforce and 
strengthen 
nativist 
sentiment 

toward members of new immigrant 
groups, which in turn influences U.S. 
responses to immigration and human 
rights issues.” 

These influences appear in politics 

and laws that are very prominent in 
our society’s very recent political 
agenda. The Muslim Ban comes 
to mind. The infamous wall at the 
Mexican-American 
border 
comes 

to mind. Children in cages and 
separation of families comes to 

mind. The rampant sentiment of 
“go back to your country” comes to 
mind.

My mother, who doesn’t speak 

English, works at a bistro. A customer 
thought that she made his coffee with 
water instead of milk and told her to 
“go back to Russia.” My mother is not 
Russian. 

Words carry meaning. Language 

influences attitudes in society. The 
fact that extraterrestrial beings are 
named after immigrants serves as 
proof. The word alien carries negative 
connotations that reinforce distinctions 
and divisions between human beings. It 
perpetuates stereotypes that make it 
impossible for our society to progress. 

The only thing all aliens have in 

common is that they’re aliens. The 
only thing that all people have in 
common is that they’re people. You 
can’t be both. 

D

espite 
the 
few 
fond 

memories of my time at 
high school, I am certain 

that I would have preferred my 
in-person experience to that of any 
K-12 student currently attending class 
virtually. Now, nearly a year into the 
pandemic, a significant proportion of 
schools still remain closed, offering 
instruction solely via a computer 
screen. 

President Joe Biden entered office 

with an ambitious reopening plan, 
pledging to return K-12 students to 
classrooms within his first 100 days. 
Following the Centers for Disease 
Control 
and 
Prevention’s 
new 

guidelines for reopening, announced 
last Friday, it is looking like that plan is 
not only ambitious but unlikely. 

With that being said, even if Biden’s 

original threshold back in December 
was over-aggressive, opening schools 
is possible. And, for the sake of all of 
the students who have dysfunctional 
or 
abusive 
households, 
depend 

on food from their school, do not 
have strong internet connections 
or are suffering through Zoom-
administered physics lessons, it 
should be treated as a priority. 

According to the CDC’s report, 

elementary 
schools 
are 
pretty 

much in the clear to go back to 
the classroom. As long as proper 
procedures, such as mask-wearing 
and social distancing, are followed, 
they can operate regardless of the 
community transmission rate. Doing 
that is not feasible for every school, 
depending on the potential size and 
infrastructure limitations, but for 
many, it can be done. Middle schools 
and high schools are also permitted to 
operate, except if transmission rates 
in the district reach the highest level 
— defined by either a 10% or greater 
positive community test rate or 100 
or more cases per 100,000 people in a 
seven-day period. 

The main barrier to schools 

reopening 
countrywide 
is 
not 

necessarily the logistics of adhering 
to safety regulations, even if that is 
difficult to do in some districts. One 
of the most prominent oppositions 
is from teachers’ unions and staff 

within the buildings, many of whom 
do not believe that schools can be 
reopened in a safe manner.

Teacher unions have held firm that 

a strict set of demands must be put in 
place before the process of reopening 
schools can begin. But even they are 
beginning to lay down their guard 
following this new report from the 
CDC, with Randi Weingarten, the 
president of the American Federation 
of Teachers, responding with a 
positive review: “Today, the CDC met 
fear of the pandemic with facts and 
evidence. … For the first time since 
the start of this pandemic, we have a 
rigorous road map, based on science, 
that our members can use to fight for 
a safe reopening.” 

For some, vaccinations have 

been at the heart of that strict 
set of demands — teachers in 
Minnesota 
have 
rallied 
and 

nurses, educators and parents plan 
to hold daily press conferences 
to voice their concerns about a 
rushed reopening.

While the CDC agrees with 

unions that teachers should be 
among the top of the priority 
hierarchy, vaccinations are not a 
prerequisite for students nor staff 
under these new guidelines. New 
York City’s success in regard to 
teacher safety has been evidence 
for that.

Still, one prominent concern 

remains for others: ventilation. 
Many schools are old and lack 
proper 
ventilation 
systems, 

which in the context of COVID-
19 could present a significant 
risk for its occupants. Experts 
have criticized the CDC’s report 
on this point, noting that a less 
aggressive emphasis should be 
placed on sanitizing surfaces 
around school buildings and more 
should be placed on ensuring 
adequate ventilation. After all, 
this is an airborne disease. 

Biden and the House Democrats 

are working on a solution to various 
infrastructure 
restraints. 
Their 

proposed 
COVID-19 
relief 
bill 

includes $129 billion in education 
relief funding that, in theory, could 

address improper ventilation in 
applicable 
districts. 
Of 
course, 

infrastructure like that will take 
some time to implement, but once it is, 
a true in-person learning experience 
could be in sight. 

The reality is reopening will not 

be perfectly risk-free. But that does 
not mean it is extraordinarily risky. 
And the values of in-person education 
need to be weighed against these 
risks. 

As 
Gov. 
Gretchen 
Whitmer 

stated this month, “The value of 
in-person learning for our kids is 
immeasurable.” She is spot on. 

Virtual schooling removes nearly 

all of the social aspects of school, 
stripping learning down to the cut-
and-dried: teaching and learning. 
There is only so much that teachers 
can do to foster participation and 
students certainly do not have the 
same ability to chat or check-in with 
their peers as they do in person. 

Racial inequities, which were 

already prominent within our school 
systems prior to the pandemic, are 
now exacerbated by online or hybrid 
learning. Nearly 30% of all K-12 
public school students in the United 
States do not have proper access to 
the internet in their homes. This, 
mixed with parents who are often 
already stretched thin with their own 
jobs and the loud environments that 
are common within multiple-family 
homes, makes for a horrendous 
learning environment for a large 
proportion of American students.

The virus’s danger must be 

acknowledged. But the CDC has 
already considered the risks, and 
within the context of schooling, the 
danger can be heavily mitigated in 
several ways. 

We should not be abandoning 

the concept of in-person schooling 
because it may require some extra 
work to reopen. Instead, go full steam 
ahead. The consequences of being 
stuck at home for students are only 
going to multiply if we don’t. 

T

his summer was not 
the first time Black Lives 
Matter protesters took to 

the streets demanding change and 
accountability of and within “the 
system.” However, it was one of the 
first times that substantive policy 
proposals came out of the movement 
and into mainstream discourse. The 
main policy proposal: defunding the 
police. 

This has different definitions 

depending on who you ask, but it can 
range anywhere from reallocating 
some 
of 
the 
funding 
police 

departments receive to mental health 
and counseling initiatives all the 
way to abolishing the entire police 
system in this country. I am not here 
to discuss the merits of this plan, but 
merely the messaging that younger 
progressives brought to the streets 
this summer. 

In 
early 
December, 
former 

President Barack Obama said, “I 
guess you can use a snappy slogan 
like ‘Defund The Police,’ but, you 
know, you lost a big audience the 
minute you say it, which makes it a lot 
less likely that you’re actually going to 
get the changes you want done.” 

What Obama is saying is that 

there are serious and systemic 
problems that need to be solved 
and addressed by politicians, but 
by using such harsh language, 
younger Democrats have alienated 
themselves 
from 
the 
larger 

population. I know from experience 
that older Americans were turned 
off from the language of “defund 
the police” at first because they 
viewed that as a direct threat to 
their personal safety. One huge 
assumption that progressives made 
is that the average person will read 
beyond the title of a plan and do 
their due diligence in researching 
the actual policies it is aiming to 
advocate. It is impossible to expect 
this of every American. Clearly, our 
messaging matters. A lot. 

In a meta-analysis of polls in June, 

around 31% of Americans supported 
defunding the police system. What is 
even more shocking is that when the 
polling question changes from “Do 
you support defunding the police?” to 
a more specific question asking if you 
would support using some taxpayer 
funds that go to the police to other 
agencies that could better respond 
to some emergencies, the number 
shoots up to 72%. 

This represents a massive gap 

between the support of the slogan 
and the support of the actual 
messaging behind it. Almost three in 
four Americans believe in the concept 
of taking some responsibilities off the 
plate of law enforcement and giving 
them to more qualified professionals 
instead. This stands sharply in 
contrast with the slightly more than 
one in four who support the attached 
slogan. 

This shows us that Obama was 

right: Messaging matters. People 
often quickly jump the gun and go 
for the home-run solution when the 
practical and effective approach 
is right in front of their eyes. It 
is important to understand that 
policymaking does not happen in a 
simple Democratic or Republican 
vacuum. Real policymaking takes 
compromise and understanding of 
others. 

A lot of young people simply see 

the world from one lens, sometimes 
clouded by privilege and relative 
inexperience. While well-intentioned, 
the messaging of defunding the police 
played right into the hands of the 
current Republican Party in the 2020 
election cycle; they ran numerous 
false 
ads 
targeting 
Democratic 

candidates 
saying 
that 
these 

candidates supported defunding the 
police when many had categorically 
denied this. These include the senate 
seats in 2020 in Maine, Iowa, North 
Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia 
— the majority of which Democrats 

lost — as well as attempting to leverage 
this claim in the presidential race. 

Additionally, an ad claiming that 

Joe Biden supported defunding the 
police decreased his net favorable 
rating by 11 points in focus groups. 
Black 
Americans, 
who 
many 

progressives claim to be acting on 
the behalf of, do not overwhelmingly 
support this policy — anywhere from 
51% of Black voters in Michigan 
are actually against defunding the 
police. These findings confirm that 
using this divisive messaging is not 
accomplishing the goal we need to 
be striving for: police reform. It is 
getting us further away from that 
goal in exchange for a snazzy slogan 
that we can exert on our parents or 
less “woke” friends. 

While I believe the damage of 

the “defund the police” slogan has 
already been done, progressives, 
liberals, 
independents 
and 

conservatives concerned with the 
gravely serious issues of police 
brutality and systemic racism should 
instead look to see how we can best 
solve this in the future. 

We can do it by approaching 

people who do not look or think like 
us to see how best to get our message 
across to them. There have been 
many issues where messaging has 
limited the policy goals behind it, 
but it must stop here. Progressives 
have great ideas to move this country 
in a positive direction, but we must 
understand how our views come 
across to others and plan accordingly. 

If 
we 
want 
to 
genuinely 

accomplish something with our 
messaging, it is not enough to merely 
think we are correct and not care 
about the public perception. We must 
engage with others on a substantive 
level to truly accomplish policy 
change in the future.

C

ollege students could reasonably 
be forgiven for being wary of 
the 
future 
of 
remote 
work. 

After nearly a year of dancing between 
hybrid classes and fully online ones 
— the uncertainty often coupled with 
an increased workload and isolation — 
remote work might seem like a tough sell. 
But even after the population reaches herd 
immunity, many companies are planning 
to offer more work-from-home options for 
their employees. 

Salesforce recently announced that it 

will allow employees to choose if they ever 
return to the office. Facebook and Twitter 
also announced similar policies. Other 
companies are targeting a fall return to 
the office, but remain tentative and don’t 
expect a sudden, full-time return. The 
lack of haste to return to the working place 
in any capacity speaks to the fact that 
overall, productivity has not decreased. If 
anything, it’s up. 

The benefits of working from home 

are numerous. Fully remote work or 
hybrid work that allows for less frequent 
travel means people can live further from 
expensive urban centers or closer to loved 
ones. It means commute time can be 
repurposed into time for family, exercise 
or rest. It means less traffic and more 
flexibility. 

We’ve been seeing all of that for almost 

a year, but have been unable to fully reap 
the rewards. A sentiment I often see is 
that we aren’t working from home: We 
are working through a crisis. Work is the 
afterthought, the last item on the to-do 
list after the job of surviving. It would feel 
a whole lot different if you could choose 

to do work in a coffee shop one day, for 
example, or catch up with friends over 
dinner after work. 

I am excited for the possibility of 

greater work-from-home opportunities. 
For one thing, it improves accessibility 
for everyone. Disability advocates have 
been asking for greater work-from-
home accommodations for years. Even 
for companies that don’t decide to let 
the majority of their employees remain 
remote, the productivity and benefits of 
remote work will make it harder to deny 
reasonable accommodations. 

It is hard to believe how often we 

went to school or meetings while ill 
prior to the pandemic. Before a cough 
represented a potentially deadly virus, it 
still represented illness, yet the messaging 
I always received was that a hard-working 
student would show up anyway. I haven’t 
even gotten a cold since last March (knock 
on wood), whereas I feel like I used to be 
a little bit sick from October to April of 
every year prior. From now on, if I’m lucky 
enough to have a job that I can do from 
home, I’ll stay home with the sniffles and 
not feel guilty about it. 

Not every job is going to be conducive to 

remote work, but many likely will, perhaps 
even entry-level jobs that University of 
Michigan grads could expect to take. It 
is, however, going to require a shift of 
mindset. 

Pandemic-era 
college 
students, 
I 

predict, are going to come out of college 
with an obliterated sense of work 
boundaries. Most of us don’t have the 
luxury of even separating our workspace 
from our sleep space the way working 

adults might. After a day of classes and 
office hours, many of us have meetings 
until well past dinner. In the before time, 
we could pretend those meetings were 
social, at least a little. Maybe someone 
would bring food, play music or make 
small talk before the beginning of the 
meeting. Now? It’s all work, Zooming past 
9:30 p.m.

We’ll likely be in this remote or 

hybrid setting for the foreseeable future, 

and I wonder if we, as students, can 
help restructure some of those virtual 
boundaries 
for 
ourselves. 
We 
can’t 

magically give ourselves home offices or 
less work, but maybe we can send less of 
those late-night homework texts? Those 
club meetings from the “great before,” do 
they all need to be Zoom calls? 

As many of us prepare to enter the 

remote workforce, I want to talk more 
seriously about how we can make it 

sustainable after the unavoidable mess 
that has been online school. For me, that 
means making myself less available after 
8 p.m., using my perennial proximity to 
the kitchen to eat a lot of small meals and 
occasionally giving up for an hour and 
lying on my bed. But I seriously can’t wait 
my room. 

B

EEP! BEEP! BEEP! It’s 9:15 a.m. I 
get up, hop in the shower and then 
get dressed. Moving semi-quickly, 

I usually prefer to go anti-“Zoom casual.” I 
don’t roll out of bed. I try to get dressed as if 
I were going to school in person, along with 
brushing my teeth; this routine helps me get 
into “school mode.”

It’s 10 a.m. and my history class is starting. 

As I join Zoom, I select “Join with Video” and 
prepare to see the faces of my classmates too. 
However, I am mistaken. The cameras are 
off, including the cameras of both professors 
— I am suddenly the only face to the learning 
process. Embarrassed, I swiftly turn mine off 
as well and for the remaining 79 minutes, I 
stare at black boxes or the names of my illusive 
peers. 

What the heck is going on? The first 

semester, I estimated, was an anomaly. As 
students, we were all getting used to Zoom 
and maybe we preferred to go unseen in our 
non-traditional learning states. So be it. Now, 
in the second semester, I’m confused. Almost 
a year into this whole “virtual learning” 
situation, are we still breaking the ice?

We shouldn’t be. In fact, keeping cameras 

on compensates for the lack of informal 
social interactions that can occur outside of 
a pandemic. In a breakout room for another 
class, I noticed a poster for Drake’s Nothing 
Was the Same album on the wall of my 
peer’s room. Coincidentally, he happens 
to be my favorite artist and NWTS is my 
favorite album, so a natural conversation 
transpired. If my friend had her camera off or 
we were in a classroom, chances are I would 
have never known she liked Drake too. In a 
pandemic setting, where creating informal 
social interactions is incredibly difficult, 
these candid on-camera moments are a social 
lifeline. 

Forbes notes that not only are face-to-face 

video calls encouraged, but they are becoming 
the norm. Gene Marks, business columnist 
and founder of The Marks Group consulting 
firm, believes that turning the camera on has 
helped him “close more deals and connect to 
our customers better.” Seeing is, quite literally, 
believing; people are more trusting in others 
when they can view them. 

The Stanford Daily ran a survey of 46 

students across the country about leaving 
their videos off during class. Two-thirds of 
respondents said they’ve been in a situation 
that is uncomfortable during class and 
preferred to not use their camera. Don’t worry, 
I get it — I’ve been there too. We all have. A 

brief period without visuals is warranted at 
times, certainly. 

However, as students, the number one thing 

we crave from our professors is transparency. 
It’s a two-way road. How can we expect it from 
our professors if they aren’t receiving it from 
us? Let’s be honest: you’re probably not paying 
attention with your camera off. I receive daily 
Snapchats of other people’s computer screens 
in a gallery view. Moreover, how does anyone 
capture the “Zoom fails” I watch on YouTube? 
While these moments are clearly mortifying, 
they are relatively preventable if you pay 
close attention to what is in view in your 
background and warn your housemates and 
family members that you are on a call.

Additionally, don’t we want to see other 

people while we learn? We feel reassured 
when assimilating with others’ confused 
looks in math class, curiosity when we catch 
someone daydreaming and solidarity in 
rolling our eyes at the one kid who always 
talks. Quite simply, face-to-face interaction is 
essential to our educational experience. 

I hate to be this guy, but there is a 

possibility that Zoom becomes our future. The 
convenience of clicking on a link and joining 
a meeting via mobile device is exponentially 
greater than the trouble of organizing 
in-person meetings. For example, say you’re a 
businessperson and have a 10 a.m. meeting. Do 
you want to wake up at 8 a.m., have to put on a 
suit and tie and wait in traffic? Or would you 
rather wake up at 9 a.m., take a shower (which 
could even be optional) and only have to focus 
on your top half looking sharp? 

Turning our cameras off, especially just 

because we feel like it, is yet another bad 
tendency of ours exposed by Zoom: laziness. 
For many of us, we often welcome the path of 
least resistance within our respective day-to-
day grinds. Thus, we have to make a conscious 
effort to salvage the positives of our day we had 
grown accustomed to before this pandemic: 
seeing each other. 

I’m not saying that you have to show us 

your roommate picking their nose in the 
background and I don’t necessarily need to see 
an empty chair if you go to the bathroom. All I 
ask is that for the sake of our collective sanity, 
it would be nice to enjoy each other’s company 
the way Zoom, FaceTime and all other video 
conferencing platforms are intended. 

Until then, I’ll be sure to wear my best 

slippers and robe. See you in class! 

T

rump is gone. After four long years 
and a particularly tumultuous last 
two weeks, former President Donald 

Trump has left office and President Joe Biden 
and Vice President Kamala Harris have been 
sworn in. While it’s natural to want to take 
some time to celebrate the inauguration of an 
at least slightly less terrible administration, it 
is important to discuss what the new Biden 
administration plans to do with its mandate 
and narrow congressional majority. While 
writers for The Daily have already discussed 
what policies the new administration should 
and should not pursue, it is important to 
consider what foreign policies they are 
actually pursuing. To quote Sen. Elizabeth 
Warren, D-Mass., “personnel is policy,” so 
it’s worth asking who Biden’s foreign policy 
personnel are.

The answers are not inspiring. Biden’s 

principal foreign policy staffers highlight his 
adherence to the bipartisan foreign policy 
status quo: one of endless war, devastating 
sanctions and pursuance of defense industry 
profits over rational decision-making.

One of Biden’s picks that best exemplifies 

these issues is Avril Haines, the Director of 
National Intelligence, who is in charge of 
coordinating intelligence relating to national 
security issues and briefing the president 
on it. Over the summer, Haines’s addition 
to the Biden campaign’s foreign policy team 
generated a great deal of controversy, both 
from generally left-wing detractors and those 
who were flabbergasted that those detractors 
existed. The latter category, consisting largely 
of former Obama administration officials, 
pointed to her creation in 2013 of guidelines 
for when drone strikes should be used. 

The most important of these guidelines 

was a standard of certainty that a drone 
strike target is actually the lawful target 
that it is aimed for. The ex-Obama officials 
in question cited these guidelines as a reason 
that anti-war progressives should support 
Haines’s addition. Samantha Power, former 
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was 
quoted as saying, “(Haines) sought to put a 
lethal instrument of U.S. power into a legal 
framework, to minimize the risk of civilian 
casualties, and to give a program shrouded in 

secrecy far more transparency.”

While it is impossible to tell how many 

civilian lives this policy saved, there are 
also plenty of problems. A 2016 report on 
civilian casualties between 2009 and 2015, 
which Haines, then-deputy national security 
advisor, was almost certainly involved in 
publishing, was considered by news outlets 
such as The Guardian to be a massive 
undercount of actual casualties. Additionally, 
years after the guidance was issued, the 
Obama administration bombed Doctors 
Without Borders hospitals in Afghanistan 
and funerals in Yemen, a violation of 
international law. Essentially, at best, the 
guidance report debatably decreased civilian 
casualties and certainly did little to increase 
transparency.

Haines’s issues don’t stop with the drone 

program. As Deputy Director of the CIA, she 
presided over the release of the Senate report 
on the CIA’s torture program. Her particular 
role was to classify as much of the report as 
possible, keeping valuable information about 
the crimes committed in the program away 
from the public’s eyes. Haines’s consistent 
stance against accountability for torturers 
and perpetrators continued with her support 
for the selection of Trump’s CIA Director 
Gina Haspel, who oversaw waterboarding at 
a CIA black site in Thailand. 

Beyond the obvious abhorrence of 

doing this in the first place, this shows an 
unwillingness on Haines’s part to hold U.S. 
government officials accountable for crimes 
they commit during her tenure, an important 
issue should anything like the CIA torture 
program ever occur again.

Haines is not the only problematic figure 

on Biden’s foreign policy team. While Biden’s 
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has spent 
most of his career in the military, and thus 
does not have a political policy-making record 
to analyze, he was, until his confirmation as 
Defense Secretary, a member of the Board 
of Directors at military contractor Raytheon 
Technologies. While he has pledged to recuse 
himself from decisions regarding his former 
employer, this still leaves an opening for 
Austin to support military actions that would 
help Raytheon’s bottom line, just as long as 

he does not have a hand in negotiating the 
contract.

Perhaps 
most 
importantly, 
Antony 

Blinken, Biden’s pick for Secretary of State, 
has been behind just about every bad foreign 
policy decision during his two decades in 
government. As then-Sen. Biden’s chief 
foreign policy advisor, he supported the 2003 
invasion of Iraq, a particularly consequential 
view given Biden’s position as Chair of the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee. As 
then-Vice President Biden’s National Security 
Advisor, he supported the 2011 invasion of 
Libya, which plunged the country into civil 
war. Additionally, as then-President Obama’s 
Deputy Secretary of State, he supported the 
Saudi invasion of Yemen, which has created 
what UNICEF has called the world’s worst 
humanitarian crisis. Even now, during his 
confirmation hearings for Secretary of State, 
he declared his support for sanctions on Iran, 
which have, among other things, crippled its 
ability to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.

Defenders of Biden will likely respond 

to all of this with something to the effect of 
“well, at least Biden’s better than Trump.” 
On issues such as climate change and 
immigration, that is true. However, with the 
exception of the war in Yemen, which Biden 
has recently spoken against, every issue 
mentioned here is a continuation of Trump-
era policies. 

Trump took the Obama administration’s 

already opaque, murderous drone program 
and made it worse. As mentioned before, 
Trump’s Haines-endorsed pick for Director 
of the CIA oversaw torture personally and 
Trump’s last confirmed Defense Secretary, 
Mark Esper, was also a weapons contractor 
lobbyist, like Austin. Every single war and 
sanctions program that Blinken supported 
was either started by Trump or continued 
under him. 

A real break from the Trump era requires 

an adjustment in its foreign policy, and 
with his initial picks for key foreign policy 
positions, President Biden seems unwilling 
to make the necessary changes.

Michigan’s depth proves its value over course of season

Michigan’s Adaptive Sports and Fitness Program: An opportunity 

to be a part of history

Michigan searches for consistency as 

postseason looms

There is a reason collegiate and 

professional basketball leagues give 

out a sixth player of the year award 

at the end of every season: Depth 

matters.

And the Michigan women’s 

basketball team has proven it has no 

shortage of depth. Rotation players 

have combined to score 16% of the 

team’s overall points this season. 

In moments when the starting five 

have required rest or missed games 

because of COVID-19 protocols, 

the bench has stepped up for the 

Wolverines. Michigan’s 13-2 record 

is in large parts a product of its depth. 

Sophomore guard Maddie Nolan 

is arguably the team’s best player off 

the bench, even earning her way into 

the starting lineup four times, first 

being thrust into the lineup when 

Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico 

put her in while junior wing Leigha 

Brown was absent with COVID-19 

complications. One of the team’s best 

3-point shooters, Nolan frequently 

reignites the Wolverines’ offensive 

momentum. In Michigan’s win 

over Wisconsin, where she scored 

a career-high 21 points, Nolan was 

a consistent outside threat that the 

team leaned on. In the early moments 

of the game, graduate student guard 

Akienreh Johnson got tangled up 

with some defenders and managed 

to find Nolan on the outside. Nolan 

fired a shot from behind the arc and 

got the team, which had bungled the 

last few possessions, back on track. 

“She’s big, a strong guard, she 

defends exceptionally well, she 

rebounds well,” Michigan coach Kim 

Barnes Arico said. “She can shoot 

the ball and that really (gives) us an 

option from the outside.”

Junior guard Danielle Rauch 

is another player that has played 

considerable time for the Wolverines, 

averaging 15.2 minutes per game and 

starting twice when Brown was out. 

Rauch’s impact can’t be quantified by 

a mere box score. 

Rauch has only scored 21 points 

in the 200 minutes she’s played 

for Michigan, but her role isn’t 

necessarily to come off the bench 

and score basket after basket. Usually 

subbing in for junior guard Amy Dilk, 

Rauch becomes a de facto manager 

of the offense, spreading the ball 

around to players for open shots. 

Rauch has 19 assists on the season, 

the fifth-most on the team even 

besting some of the starters who’ve 

gotten much more time on the court. 

“I’d give Danielle Rauch a lot of 

credit. She’s really grown into her 

role outside and on the court,” Dilk 

said when asked about leadership 

within the team. “All of us, with 

everything going on, have really had 

to step up and have a leadership role.” 

Junior forward Emily Kiser 

missed the first five games of the 

season due to an ankle injury, but 

she’s emerged as a consistently 

solid defender since her return. 

Specifically, Kiser has demonstrated 

her ability to play strong defense in 

the post with senior forward Hailey 

Brown and junior forward Naz 

Hillmon. 

Sophomore guard Michelle Sidor 

is another rotation player that hasn’t 

seen a lot of playing time but has 

been efficient with the minutes she 

gets. Appearing in 10 games off of the 

bench, Sidor is most effective from 

behind the arc, shooting 34.8% from 

deep so far this season. She knocked 

down three triples against Oakland 

and tied her career-high 16 points 

against Butler, a performance fueled 

by 4-for-8 shooting behind the arc. 

The four-player freshman class 

has also shown flashes of talent for 

the Wolverines, revealing a bright 

future where Michigan has roster 

depth in the long term. 

Depth matters, and Michigan is 

lucky to have such consistent players 

to back up its starters. 

In an unorthodox season, you 

never know when a player will have 

to take up the mantle of the team’s 

mantra: “Next man up.” 

Come March, it might make all 

the difference. 

When Chris Kelley arrived in New York for 

a wheelchair tennis tournament, continuing 

his athletic career at Michigan was already on 

his radar. 

As the 2019 United States Tennis 

Association champion with a No. 2 ranking in 

the Men’s A division, Kelley was highly sought 

after and Dr. Feranmi Okanlami, the Director 

of Michigan’s Adaptive Sports and Fitness 

program, had made it clear that he wanted 

Kelley as a Wolverine. 

About to return home, Kelley crossed 

paths with “the tipping point” — Okanlami 

was coincidentally at the same New York 

airport as him at the same time. 

“It felt like I was supposed to be here (at 

Michigan),” Kelley said. 

While Okanlami may not be able to 

stumble upon every prospective athlete 

across the nation, Michigan must find a way 

to separate itself from colleges like Alabama, 

which has a multi-million dollar facility 

dedicated to adaptive sports, or Illinois and its 

rich adaptive sports history.

Still in the early stages, it’s no secret that 

the Wolverines are playing catch up. But 

Michigan has all the makings of becoming a 

recruiting powerhouse in the Midwest.

“There is no program that exists in 

Michigan and the surrounding area,” 

Erik Robeznieks, the Project Manager of 

Michigan’s Adaptive Sports and Fitness 

program, said. “The closest program to us 

in the collegiate space is the University of 

Illinois.”

Kelley, a Michigan native, chose not to 

play adaptive sports as an undergrad because 

there simply wasn’t an in-state option. 

Now, there is. As a result, Michigan can tap 

into the in-state recruiting pool, as well as the 

remainder of the Midwest athletes looking 

for a program closer to home — a clear path 

to bolstering a program on the rise. With that 

said, it is far more than the most convenient 

option. 

“The academics (were) another thing that 

drew me to Michigan,” Kelley said. “When 

you’re looking at athletics, whether you’re 

on the adaptive or able-bodied side, we all 

know that eventually, we’re not going to be 

playing sports. Our bodies will get to a point 

where competitive play just isn’t in the cards 

anymore. When I started thinking about my 

future, the opportunities that the University 

has for me to further my education were more 

appealing to me.”

A blossoming relationship with Michigan 

Medicine offers Adaptive Sports a critical 

resource when it comes to sports medicine 

and prioritizing the health of its student-

athletes. 

“Having somebody who understands 

disabilities and the needs of the wheelchair 

population on a team overall is pretty 

important,” Kelley said. “Johan Latorre is one 

of the coaches that helps out, and he’s also a 

doctor.”

But physical health is not the only factor 

contributing to an athlete’s ability to perform 

at the highest level. A robust support team 

fortified by university resources assists 

student-athletes with all aspects of life.

“The fact that there is an integrated 

support team between academic support 

services, program staff, the coach, their peer 

student-athletes,” Robeznieks said. “We have 

all those different resources and connections 

within the University in place to support the 

all-around student-athlete.”

Yet programs like Michigan Medicine, 

MDisability and Services for Students with 

Disabilities are just the tip of the iceberg. A 

partnership with the Ann Arbor Center for 

Independent Living has provided a space that 

Adaptive Sports can call its own.

“Our 
athletes 
need 
strength 
and 

conditioning,” Robeznieks said. “They need 

fitness beyond their sport. We’ve painted 

the walls maize and blue. We put in rubber 

flooring to actually make a better tactile 

environment for people in day-chairs.”

Adaptive Sports has also partnered with 

the Varsity Tennis Center and the U-M 

Indoor Track Building, providing frequent 

access to high-level facilities. But “frequent” is 

not enough. Equitable access to the resources 

Michigan offers able-bodied student-athletes 

is the program’s ticket to appealing to the best 

adaptive student-athletes around the country. 

“We’re not asking for a 10-million dollar 

facility for ourselves,” Robeznieks said. “We’re 

just looking for that same level of access.”

As the program continues its efforts for 

equitable resources, notoriety remains an 

equally important area for improvement. A 

multitude of facilities are only worthwhile 

if prospective student-athletes are aware of 

them. Largely dependent on word of mouth as 

of now, Adaptive Sports has centered its focus 

on carving out its own recruiting pipeline by 

linking itself to the greater adaptive sports 

community. 

“A great end for us was establishing 

connections with the people who are now 

affiliated with the Midwest Adaptive Sports 

Committee,” Robzenieks said. “We are now 

in with a system of people and organizations 

that operate within adaptive sports at the 

junior level in Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, 

Michigan and Ohio.”

Mary Free Bed Rehabilitation Hospital, 

the Turnstone Center for Children & 

Adult with Disabilities and the Great 

Lakes Adaptive Sports Association have 

generated a recruiting pool brimming with 

talented athletes looking for post-secondary 

education.

On the flip side of things, universities 

across the country need help from the NCAA 

to make information about prospective 

adaptive student-athletes more readily 

available. 

“In 
able-bodied 
tennis, 
there’s 
the 

Universal Tennis Ranking,” Kelley said. “You 

get star-rankings so you might be a one-star 

recruit or a two-star recruit or a three-star 

recruit. And in wheelchair tennis, we don’t 

have something like that right now.”

With 
the 
minimal 
recruiting 

infrastructure in place for adaptive sports, 

there needs to be a massive implementation of 

tools and platforms to help coaches and scouts 

evaluate the best athletes around the country.

When there are elite players like Kelley, 

decorated with accolades and looking to take 

their athletic career to the next level, the 

entirety of the adaptive sports realm needs to 

know about it.

As the logistics of adaptive sports continue 

to be fluid at both the university and national 

level, one thing remains constant: Michigan’s 

program offers the opportunity to be a part of 

history. 

“It takes a very different kind of athlete to 

come to a new program because there is a bit 

of unknown rather than the tried and true 

history of some of these more established 

programs,” Robeznieks said. “But some of 

the feedback we’ve gotten from the athletes 

so far is that they feel a lot of value being part 

of the University of Michigan Adaptive Sports 

program because day after day we’re forging 

history. 

“We’re building a program from scratch 

and they get to be there from day one.”

A lack of focus. No energy. Not 

being mentally prepared.

These were the factors that 

contributed to the Michigan hockey 

team’s upset loss Friday night 

against Ohio State. Fortunately for 

the Wolverines, they were able to 

bounce back the next day with a 6-0 

throttling of the Buckeyes. 

Come tournament time, though, 

Michigan won’t be afforded the 

luxury of a second chance. 

“We’re gonna get into a situation, 

a big game where it’s just a one-off,” 

Michigan coach Mel Pearson said. 

“You don’t get a second opportunity. 

That’s your season, and how would 

you like to feel after you play like that 

and you’re done?”

Since the Wolverines returned 

from 
their 
COVID-19 
induced 

shutdown, they’ve split both their 

series. One game, they’ll look like 

an unstoppable force that can score 

at will. The next, they’ll be caught 

completely flat-footed and unable to 

make up an early deficit. 

“I asked our team what’s the 

difference from one night to the 

next,” Pearson said. “For some its 

mental preparation. You have to work 

through that. You have to find a way 

to persevere and work through that.”

Being plagued by inconsistent play 

is an issue many teams deal with, 

mainly in the early stages of a season. 

It’s not something Michigan wants to 

be working through now — especially 

with the Big Ten Tournament 

looming just over three weeks away. 

It 
appeared 
the 
Wolverines 

were hitting their stride prior to the 

shutdown. Following the long layoff 

for winter break, Michigan won five of 

its first six games and was building its 

rapport as a national title contender. 

As the Wolverines work back from 

the pause, the team is desperately 

trying to get its conditioning back to 

the level it needs to be. 

“(That 
two-week 
shutdown) 

happened at the most inopportune 

time,” Pearson said. “That’s our big 

challenge, is how much do we need 

physically. But at the same time, we’ve 

got to back off so mentally so they can 

recharge and refresh.”

It’s no mystery how good this 

team can be. Michigan has been 

ranked in the top-10 all season, 

and even after their loss to an 

Ohio State team with just six wins, 

it stayed planted at No. 7. The 

perception is that this team will 

be fighting it out with the nation’s 

elite come late March. And 

yet, the Wolverines aren’t even 

dominating their own conference. 

They are currently tied for third 

place in the standings, 11 points 

behind Wisconsin and 15 behind 

Minnesota. They’ll have to go 

through both to win the Big Ten 

Tournament, and they’ll have to 

come into each game mentally 

and physically prepared — with no 

wiggle room for off days.

“Maybe these guys are just waiting 

to turn it on or turn it off,” Pearson 

said. “I still think we’re probably 

another week, week and a half away 

from being where we need to be.”

Not every game is going to be an 

offensive shootout. In between, there 

will be slow-paced, war-of-attrition 

type battles. In single-elimination 

tournaments, the Wolverines can’t 

afford to quit if the game’s style of 

play doesn’t align with theirs. 

Michigan needs to approach these 

upcoming games with a consistent 

effort, and finding that consistency 

starts in practice. Pearson expressed 

his frustration with his players’ latest 

work ethic: 

“When I put them on the goal line 

and they skate down to the far end 

and touch the boards and come back 

as fast as they can; they go pretty fast. 

And then you say, ‘Okay, why don’t I 

put five million dollars down at the 

end of the rink and you got to go down 

there and there’s another five million 

when you come back.’ Are you gonna 

skate faster? They usually say every 

time, ‘Oh, absolutely.’ ” 

“Well, why? Why can’t you do it all 

the time? Why can’t you play all out all 

the time?”

So can Michigan flip the switch? 

That’s the five million dollar question.

COLUMBUS — Something had 

to give. 

Entering Sunday, the Michigan 

men’s basketball team boasted 
the nation’s seventh-best defense. 
Ohio State, meanwhile, owned the 
third-best offense. 

In 
a 
battle 
of 
Big 
Ten 

heavyweights, the Buckeye attack 
proved potent. Yet, the Wolverine 
offense matched Ohio State punch 
for punch, rising to the occasion 
and 
securing 
Michigan 
(16-1 

overall, 11-1 Big Ten) a decisive 
92-87 road win over the Buckeyes
(18-5, 12-5). 

“We’re going to enjoy this 

victory,” Michigan coach Juwan 
Howard said. “Overall, it was a 
big production for everyone who 
played in that game from start 
to finish, every guy contributed 
huge, made great plays for us 
down the stretch.” 

One hundred and nine years 

passed before a top-5 matchup 
precipitated on the hardwood 
between the bitter rivals. The first 
one, though, lived up to its billing. 

Both teams came out swinging. 

Duane 
Washington 
notched 

10 quick points for Ohio State, 
showcasing a lethal 3-point stroke. 
Senior wing Chaundee Brown 
offered a counter off the bench, 
draining three 3-pointers and 
keying an 8-0 run that dug the 
Wolverines out of an early five 
point hole. 

“I told (senior forward) Isaiah 

Livers in warmups, I was like, ‘I 
like these rims, I love these rims,’ 
” Brown said. “I was like, ‘Yo, it’s 
gonna be a good one.’ ”

Brown’s teammates followed 

suit, 
with 
Michigan 
putting 

together a scintillating first-half 
performance, punctuated by a 
10-of-13 mark from beyond the
arc. On 17 first-half baskets, the
Wolverines recorded 12 assists. 

“Our guys understand … about 

just making the easy plays,” 
Howard said. “And we need more 
ball and player movement. And 
get away from the iso-ball. So the 
different defensive reads, our guys 
took their time making simple 
plays.”

Though 
Michigan’s 
offense 

percolated, the Wolverines failed 
to build an advantage on the 
scoreboard. Each basket induced 
an answer from Ohio State at 
the other end, with 6-foot-7 E.J. 
Liddell giving Michigan fits. 
Liddell’s three offensive rebounds 
contributed to 10 second-chance 
points in the first half. Heading 
into the locker room, Michigan 
clenched a two point lead. 

In the opening minutes of the 

second half, the offense grew cold. 
Open looks, the likes of which the 
Wolverines capitalized on during 
the first twenty minutes, became 
misses. Ohio State seized a three 
point lead. 

And yet, Michigan clawed 

back, shifting its attention inside 
to 
7-foot-1 
freshman 
center 

Hunter Dickinson. Pulverizing an 
undersized Buckeye frontcourt, 
Dickinson scored 16 of his team-
high 22 points in the second half. 

“That’s what we expect him to 

do,” senior guard Eli Brooks said. 
“We feel that he can’t be stopped 
down there. He’s proven himself 
that he can score against anybody. 
He did that today.” 

The offense, though, by no 

means became one-dimensional. 
Five different Wolverines scored 
in double-figures, with a sixth — 
sophomore wing Franz Wagner 
— finishing with nine points. They 
only committed seven turnovers, 
with all but one coming before 
halftime. 

“The 
ball 
movement 
was 

really great today,” Dickinson 
said. “That’s something I think 
has been great all year. Such 
an unselfish team, I think I’ve 
said it after every game, how 
unselfish the team played. I think 
everybody just enjoys playing with 
one another, so it’s really easy to 
share the ball.”

A pair of ferocious offensive 

rebounds by Brown sustained 
a possession that culminated in 
his lay-up, giving Michigan a two 
point lead with 5:45 to play. It was 
a lead the Wolverines wouldn’t 
relinquish. 

The two teams continued to 

trade blows in a game marked by 
its intensity and physicality. The 
tide seemed to turn definitively 
in Michigan’s favor when Livers 
scooped up an errant Ohio State 
pass. He finished on the other 
end with an and-one, giving the 
Wolverines a six-point lead with 
2:33 left. 

With the clock waning, Livers 

spiked Ohio State’s inbounds pass 
back down the court, thwarting 
the last-ditch comeback attempt. 
The Buckeye sideline sat in silence 
while Michigan spilled onto the 
court and bum-rushed the tunnel, 
relishing its most-impressive win 
on a season that seems destined 
for a special ending.

Michigan proved its me in a top-5 victory on the road Sunday.

MILES MACKLIN/Daily 

The Wolverines dominated from outside and in the paint to best Ohio State on Sunday afternoon.

Videos were shown, elbows 

were thrown, some choice 
words were exchanged and 
bodies hit the floor.

Whenever 
Michigan 
and 

Ohio 
State 
square 
off 
— 

regardless of the sport — there 
are sure to be some fireworks 
and animosity. On Sunday, 
though, bolstered by both 
teams’ top-5 rankings and 
their recent encounters, the 
intensity was ratcheted up. 

The bitter rivals were at 

each other’s throats with hard 
fouls, aggressive drives to the 
rim and players diving for loose 
balls. The Wolverines seemed 
to relish the physicality. 

“I 
like 
these 
types 
of 

games, dog fights,” senior 
guard Chaundee Brown said. 
“Like (Michigan coach Juwan 
Howard) says, it’s a boxing 
match.”

From the tip-off, it was clear 

the game was going to be a war 
of attrition. Whichever team 
was left standing at the end 
was going to have to earn it. 
Using every bit of motivation 
afforded by the Buckeyes, 
Michigan did just that. 

It’s typical for players and 

coaches to claim that they 
view each game in a vacuum, 
that they don’t look ahead to 
any one opponent and don’t 
look back at the results of 
previous 
seasons. 
For 
the 

Wolverines, who hadn’t won in 
Columbus since 2014, this was 
not the case. 

“The biggest thing that we 

came into it looking at was our 
record at Ohio State,” senior 
guard Eli Brooks said. “That’s 
something we really wanted 
to change at the start of the 
day. That’s what drove us the 
most.”

While seniors like Brooks 

didn’t want to see their 0-3 
road record extended further, 
even those playing in their first 
game against the Buckeyes 
had added motivation. 

Prior to the game, Howard 

showed the team a video of 
Ohio State players dancing in 
the locker room after beating 
Michigan 
for 
the 
second 

time last year. The Buckeyes 
subsequently also started a 
tradition of presenting “golden 
jersey” trinkets to players who 
sweep the Wolverines in the 
season-series. Michigan took 
offense to all of it. 

“Of 
course 
we 
were 

motivated by it,” freshman 
center Hunter Dickinson said. 
“But I think the players here 
last year and coach Howard 
were 
probably 
the 
most 

motivated from watching that 
video. 

“I think it was just the 

Michael Jordan approach, any 
little thing that can get you 
extra motivated helps. That 
was something that definitely 
got everybody really prepared 
for this game and motivated.”

Added Brooks: “Yeah, we 

showed them a couple videos 
that rubbed us the wrong way 
and that we wanted to change 
the tides, so that’s why we did 

that.”

Despite this being their first 

taste of the rivalry, Brown 
and Dickinson were involved 
in a majority of the trash talk 
and strife — Brown by choice 
and Dickinson by virtue of 
his position. At one point, the 
referees had to step in and tell 
Brown to tone down the back-
and-forth he was having with 
a Buckeye.

Meanwhile, 
the 
usually 

even-keeled, 
mild-mannered 

Dickinson 
threw 
down 
a 

monstrous two-handed dunk 
in traffic with a little more 
aggression than usual, driving 
the Michigan bench to near-
hysteria. 

“I could tell that they didn’t 

like us, and we sure didn’t 
like them either,” Dickinson 
said. “You could see that it 
was a really competitive game 
and I think there’s definitely 
something to be said for an 
Ohio State-Michigan rivalry. 
It’s definitely one of the best 
in the country.”

Whether 
it 
was 
from 

newcomers to the rivalry or 
veterans well-conditioned to 
the rough-and-tumble nature 
of it, the Wolverines brought 
a bit more intensity over the 
Michigan-Ohio border. And it 
paid off in a big way. 

“Gonna 
enjoy 
the 
bus 

ride home with the victory,” 
Howard said. “Because I’ve 
been on the other side before 
when you’ve lost a game and 
you had to have a bus ride back 
home. It’s not a good feeling.”

Michigan proved it’s ready for March, maybe April

Due to the nature of the rivalry, Michigan brought particular fervor in its win over Ohio State on Sunday.

ETHAN 
SEARS

COLUMBUS 
— 
Hunter

Dickinson fired off a tweet and 
stepped up to the Zoom camera.

“First of all, did you literally 

just tweet that clap back at Doug 
Gottlieb before coming on this 
Zoom call?” a reporter asked.

“Yeah.”
Around 

when 
 

Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 
was 
tipping 

off
in

Columbus, 
Gottlieb, 
a 

sports radio 
host, 
had 

tweeted: 
“Michigan 
hasn’t 
played 
the

better Big 10 teams, got smoked by 
Minnesota on the road… Hard to 
guess how they play today- smart 
money is on Ohio State.”

It’s the kind of sentiment the 

Wolverines have heard for much 
of the season. They’ll probably 
hear much less of it after Sunday. 
Because, really, what else is left to 
question. Between Gottlieb’s tweet 
and Dickinson’s press conference, 
Michigan and Ohio State played 
the sort of basketball game usually 
reserved for an elevated court in 
April. Shots hitting nets. Bodies 
hitting floors. Dickinson and E.J. 
Lidell battling. Chaundee Brown 
and Duane Washington Jr. all over 
the place. Rankings tend to border 
on meaningless — this, though, felt 
every bit like No. 3 vs. No. 4. 

Michigan came out on top, 

92-87. It is, at this point, a
prohibitive favorite to win the
Big Ten regular-season title. The
questions left now are reserved for 
March. So Dickinson hit back at

 Gottlieb, responding: “Lol.”
“I think coming into the season, 

some people didn’t have us ranked in 
the 
country,” 
Dickinson 
said. 

“Some people had us ranked I 
think seven in the Big Ten. And so 
I don’t think it’s anything new to us. 
I think one way or another, they’re 
gonna have to, I guess, realize 
who we are and what we’re about. 
One way or another. 

“We don’t look for anybody’s 

appreciation. 
We’re 
gonna 
go 

out there and earn it every day in 
practice and in the games.”

If 
you 
didn’t 
think 
those 

questions were answered before 
Sunday, look to the first half. The 
Buckeyes were bringing double-
teams on Dickinson every time he 
put the ball on the floor, making it 
impossible 
for 
him 
to 
score 

inside. So Michigan moved the 
ball and shot the lights out with 10 3-
pointers and 12 assists, keeping it in 
the game when its defense and its 
star big man couldn’t.

Or look to halftime. That’s when 

Brown, one of those players who 
was on fire from outside in the 
first half, told Wolverines’ coach 
Juwan Howard: “Go to Hunter.” 

Needing to stop Michigan from 

shooting 
more 
3-pointers, 
Ohio 

State 
didn’t 
pressure 
Dickinson 

quite as much in the last 20 
minutes. So he scored 16 points 
with five rebounds, including a 
two-handed dunk that shook the 
Schottenstein 
Center’s 

foundations to put the Wolverines up 
82-76.

“They had a 6-7 guy (Lidell) 

guarding a 7-2 guy,” Brown said. 
“So I’m like, if they double, we 
have myself, Isaiah (Livers), Mike 
(Smith), Eli (Brooks), (as) shooters 
around the perimeter. So they 

gotta give one. They’re not gonna 
double him, or if they do, we 
gotta shoot it. It was just common 
sense.”

You can also look a few minutes 

before that dunk. That’s when 

Brown 
grabbed 
two 
straight 

offensive rebounds underneath 
Michigan’s basket with Buckeye 
bodies all around him. He flipped 
up a putback attempt — the 
Wolverines’ third shot of what’s 
technically 
classified 
as 
one 

possession — that went in. It put 
Michigan up 71-69, a lead it never 
relinquished. 

“It was very inspiring,” Howard 

said.

But let’s go back to what Brown 

said for a second. It gets at the 
heart of what makes Michigan 
so good, so frustrating to play, so 
impossible to defend. You can’t 
get away with single-covering 
Dickinson. You can’t get away 
with leaving the Wolverines’ 
shooters. Unless you’ve got a big 
man capable of containing a guy 

who looks like a Player of the Year 
candidate or Michigan happens to 
have a bad day shooting, there’s no 
answer.

“When it’s time to compete 

out there on the floor, we talk 

about all the time, winning the 
day and be(ing) appreciative of 
the opportunity to have this time 
to play basketball,” Howard said. 
“During these games when there 
are tough stretches, when we go 
through scoring droughts or turn 
the ball over or the other team gets 
an offensive rebound, our guys 
always figure it out and stay the 
course.”

Slowly but surely, the truth of 

that — the truth of everything 
Howard preaches — has become 
evident over the course of the last 
three months. It’s been impossible 
to ignore or shrug off since mid-
January, when the Wolverines 
blew the doors off Minnesota and 
Wisconsin at home. 

Since they’ve returned from a 

COVID-19-induced pause, beating 

the Badgers on the road, Rutgers 
at home and Ohio State in what 
might be the best game of college 
basketball’s regular season, even 
those with their heads in the sand 
have awoken to the possibility that 
this team might just be playing on 

a Monday night in April.

“Welp,” Gottlieb tweeted after 

the game. “Missed this one.”

LSA COLLEGIATE LECTURE

In the halftime locker room 

during 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball team’s game against Ohio 

State, senior wing Chaundee Brown 

had one message for Michigan 

coach Juwan Howard: 

“Go to Hunter.”

In their biggest game of the year, 

the Wolverines shouldered their 

offensive load onto freshman center 

Hunter Dickinson. Putting that 

kind of pressure on any freshman 

will undoubtedly lead to a few 

butterflies. At this point in his 

young career, though, Dickinson 

has grown accustomed to it. 

The night before the game, 

Dickinson met with Howard to 

go over film. The pair broke down 

Dickinson’s game, zeroing in on 

areas that could still be polished.

“Those one-on-one film sessions, 

those workouts that we have, 

the team workouts, the big man 

workouts, 
he’s 
growing 
before 

our eyes,” Howard said. “It takes 

freshmen a little longer to figure 

it out, but Hunter has this high 

basketball IQ because of his passion 

for the game and the way how he’s 

accepted learning. A lot of guys 

don’t want to be coached. Hunter 

wants to be coached.”

Dickinson was held relatively 

in check in the first half. He was 

routinely 
swarmed 
by 
double 

teams and struggled to find looks 

inside, forcing the Wolverines to 

concentrate their offensive attack 

on the perimeter. The strategy paid 

off, and a 10-for-13 3-point shooting 

display in the first half forced the 

Buckeyes to take their attention 

away from the paint.

“They had a 6-7 guy guarding a 

7-2 guy,” Brown said. “So I’m like, if 

they double, we have myself, Isaiah 

(Livers), Mike (Smith), Eli (Brooks) 

(as) shooters around the perimeter. 

So they gotta give one. They’re not 

gonna double him or if they do we 

gotta shoot it. It was just common 

sense.”

Once the Buckeyes keyed in 

on 
stopping 
the 
Wolverines’ 

3-point 
attack, 
Dickinson 
had 

an opportunity to take over. He 

notched 16 points in the last 20 

minutes alone, whether it was at 

the free throw line, shimmies in 

the post or a thunderous jam over 

two Buckeyes that put Michigan up, 

75-72, with 4:19 minutes left. 

The 
Buckeyes’ 
E.J. 
Liddell, 

who stands at 6-foot-7, drew the 

assignment of Dickinson. With 

Dickinson standing at 7-foot-2, the 

Wolverines continued to feed him 

nearly every trip down. 

For Dickinson, his second half 

masterclass isn’t anything new. He’s 

proven that he’s more than willing 

to shoulder the scoring load in the 

second half, whether it be willing 

Michigan’s offense to a two-point 

win over Penn State in its Big Ten 

opener or scoring 13 second half 

points to help defeat Maryland on 

the road. While most freshmen may 

shy away from the big moments, 

Dickinson lives for them.

“Hunter’s performance shows 

to me exactly what I knew from 

the beginning and why I recruited 

him,” 
Howard 
said. 
“He’s 
a 

competitor. He’s not gonna beg or 

shy away from competition.”

As much as Howard praises 

Dickinson, the young center speaks 

just as, if not more, glowingly of 

his coach. Following a 10-point 

outing against Rutgers that saw him 

shoot just 4-of-10, Dickinson was 

unhappy with his performance. He 

turned to Howard for guidance on 

how to bounce back.

“Whenever I’m down on myself 

from a previous game … I always 

come to him and ask (Howard) to 

go over the previous game with 

me,” Dickinson said. “He’s really a 

player-friendly coach, so whenever 

I come to him for help, he’s always 

there 110% with me.”

One key aspect of Dickinson’s 

game that he has expressed desire 

to work on is working out of double 

teams. On Sunday, he looked far 

more comfortable working out of 

them, consistently firing cross-

court passes to open shooters.

“Today, I think they came with 

different looks at me,” Dickinson 

said. “I think the experience from 

playing teams who have doubled 

me, teams who haven’t and then 

teams who mix it up has really 

helped me grow in that aspect. (I’m) 

just really reading the floor a lot 

better.”

More and more, Howard can see 

a little bit of himself in Dickinson, 

whether it be his drive to work on 

his game, his work in the post or his 

willingness to get better. He even 

thinks one day Dickinson could 

be a coach if he chooses to once he 

retires.

Howard knows that can wait 

though. In the short term, Dickinson 

and the dominant Wolverines have 

other goals on their mind.
