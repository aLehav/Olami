THE TEXTBOOK MARKET
Study finds
alternative
textbooks a
cheaper buy

DIAG DASH

Profs., students still
hesitant to switch to
online textbooks
By ALEXA BREEDVELD
Daily Staff Reporter
Textbooks can be one of the
largest expenses for students, but
according to a recent study by the
Student Public Interest Research
Group, new technology could less-
en that financial burden.
The Student PIRG study - "A
Cover to Cover Solution: How
Open Textbooks Are the Path to
Textbook Affordability" - is a
response to a change in the Higher
Education Opportunity Act that
was passed over the summer. The
change aimed to make the process
of buying textbooks cheaper and
easier for students by requiring
professors to post textbook lists for
classes during class registration.
In its report, Student PIRG
found that online alternatives to
traditional print textbooks are both
cheaper for students and easier for
professors to update.
Additionally, Student PIRG
reported that "open textbooks" -
free or inexpensive textbooks that

can be downloaded or printed from
websites like Project Gutenberg or
Google Books - are particularly
efficient for students and can be
used as either a printed or digital
text.
Steve White, a professor at the
University of Massachusetts-
Dartmouth who contributed to a
conference call on Thursday about
the study's release, said he is very
concerned about the rising cost of
student textbooks.
"As a professor, I've noticed that
many of my students are forgoing
buying the textbooks due to finan-
cial hardship, especially since the
economic downturn," White said.
"Their performance in the class
suffers when they don't have the
book or access to the book."
White said he prefers online
textbooks, particularly open text-
books, to traditional print text-
books.
"I can customize the (online)
textbook and teach the material
I want," White said. "I can add or
delete material as I see fit."
Nicole Allen, a Student PIRG
leader and one of the directors of
the study, said that online text-
books will make education signifi-
cantlymore affordable for students.

Fil-m tax cut helps A2 business

Hotels, t-shirt
companies see more
business when film
crews arrive
By JENNA SIMARD
Daily StaffReporter
Since becoming a law in 2008,
the Michigan film tax incentive
has received significant atten-
tion from both supporters and
opponents.

With increased sightings of
celebrities around the state,
many Michiganders have been
questioning whether the law -
which offers a 40-percent tax
rebate to companies that shoot
films in Michigan - has actually
provided the state with tangible
benefits in exchange for the tax
break.
But Jim Burnstein, screen-
writing coordinator in the Uni-
versity's Department of Screen
Arts and Cultures and a veteran
of the film industry, has only
positive things to say about the

incentive.
"It's working beyond any-
body's expectations" said
Burnstein, who is now on the
Michigan Film Office Advisory
Council. He added that it cre-
ates a lot of jobs directly in film
production, and that the most
important jobs are the ones that
don't get measured by the critics'
reports.
According to Burnstein,
in 2009 film crews in Michi-
gan spent 2,000 nights in local
hotels. Local restaurants, cater-
ing businesses and t-shirt com-

panies have also had increased
sales.
Jerry Kozak, one of the found-
ers and owners of the Ann Arbor
T-shirt Company, said he saw his
company's sales increase within
only a few months after the com-
pany started two years ago. The
company has had a number of
films place large orders, which
he says has had more than just an
economic benefit.
"Outside of the money itself,
it's also given us some credibility
since we are a young company,

Landlords say economy
changing housing trends

Owners say students
are splitting rooms
to save money
in downturn
By LINDSAY KRAMER
Daily StaffReporter
As many freshmen and countless
tenants are coming to realize, the
Ann Arbor housing scramble for
the next school year is back and in
full swing.
Popular campus realtors like
Arch Realty, Old Town Realty
and Prime Student Housing have
acknowledged the early rush to
find housing has begun. While the

yearly timeframe of the housing
scramble hasn't changed, some liv-
ing patterns have - possibly due to
the economy.
Arch Realty Leasing Director
Charisse Traband said in an e-mail
interview that while students con-
tinue to look for the same types of
housing from year to year, the hous-
es are getting a bit more crowded.
"We do see that students are
more likely to share rooms and
decrease individual costs," Tra-
band wrote.
Old Town Realty Business
Manager Rudy Acuna said in an
interview that tenants have been
keeping their homes in better con-
dition than in years past to get their
full security deposits back.
"They checked out a lot cleaner

this year, probably because people
wanted all their money back,"
Acuna said. "There are a lot more
people trying to over-occupy which
we have to monitor a lot more
closely."
Despite this slight change in
residents being more willing to
share rooms and doing what they
can to drive down costs, the same
expensive and popular locations
are still the most competitive and
likely to be leased earliest in the
year.
"The most popular area is the
south campus near Hill, Oakland,
Church, and E. University," Tra-
band wrote. "A close second runner-
up would be the Kerrytown area
between N. Huron and Kingsley."

DPS: Robbery suspect seen
panhandling on'U' grounds

Two candidates challenging Dingell

Yshelu Johnson was
charged with
robbing a student
near South Quad
By DEVON THORSBY
DailyNewsEditor
The man accused of robbing
a University student outside of
South Quadrangle on Sept. 23

has been reported on and around
campus multiple times since his
release from jail, Department of
Public Safety spokeswoman Diane
Brown confirmed yesterday after-
noon.
According to the crime alert
released the day of the robbery,
a student reported to University
Police that a man grabbed him
and pulled him a few feet from
the sidewalk, demanding money.
Once the student gave the man
money, the crime alert said he fled

the scene on foot. The robbery
happened at around 11:45 that
morning.
Brown said that Yshelu John-
son was arrested for the crime by
University Police later that day,
and was arraigned for the crime
on Sept. 24. Shortly thereafter, he
was released on 10 percent of a
$5,000 bond. Brown said he was
reportedly seen back on campus
within hours of his release.

Dingell's tenure in
House is a liability
By BETHANY BIRON

U.S. Congressman John Ding-
ell (D-Mich.) may have 54 years
worth of incumbency to his advan-

tage in the race for Michigan's 15th
district U.S. House of Representa-
tives seat. But this hasn't deterred
others from vying for the position.
Republican candidate Rob-
ert Steele and Matthew Furman,
a member of the U.S. Taxpayers
Party of Michigan, will be on the
ballot on Nov. 2, running against
Dingell. Both candidates aim to
change certain policies Dingell has
supported during his time in office,
though they each have different
approaches to solving the nation's

pressing issues.
Steele, a University alum and
local physician, hasn't been
involved in politics prior to his can-

experience immigracing co the Unit-
ed Staesfrom Cuba at12 years old has
provided her with firsthand knowl-
edge of both the subjects she teachen
and researchen at the University.
As part of her work, she approaches
race, ethnicity and immigration from
a sociological perspective.
A University alum and faculty
member since 1988, Pedraza focuses
her research and syllabi on immigra-
tion. A former director of the Uni-
versity's American Culture Latino
Studies Program, Pedraza's current
work is influencedhby her past.
Pedraza's family immigrated to
the United Scates because of the 1959
Cuban Revolution. To describe her
family's situation, she referenced
Melinda Lopez's play, "Sonia Flew."
The play is currently showing at Ann

about the 54,000 Cuban children
who came alone. There was a rumor
going around in Havana at the time
of the beginning of the Revolution.
They were going to round up all the
children and send them to study in
the Soviet Union and take them away
from their parents," she explained.
"This play is really aboutcthatedrama."
Although she did not come to the
United States alone, Pedraza said she
was separated from her parents for a
number of years after immigrating.
"Various family, conflicts become
a part of that decision and this is all
very well portrayed in the play," she
said.
Once she arrived in the U.S.,
Pedraza attended a Quaker board-
ingaschool in Maine until she finished
high school. She then decided to
attend the University for her under-
graduate degree and graduated in
1967 with a B.A. in sociology. She
went on to earn her M.A. is teach-

ing from the University as well. She
received her Ph.D. in sociology from
the University of Chicago.
She has received the Excellence
in Education Award twice from the
University and the President and
Provost's Award for Service, among
other awards throughout her career.
As a dual citizen of the United
States and Cuba, Pedraza is able to
return to Cuba using a family reuni-
fication visa. The nature of her work
also requires that she travel back to
conduct interviews. Pedraza esti-
mates that she has traveled there at
least 12 times.
"There is a very strong dissident
movement in Cuba right now. I do
expect that there will be a new demo-
cratic awakening, which is how I like
to think of it," she said. "And when it
comes, I expect that I will be able to
help in some fashion."

DETROIT
Convicted political
consultant seeks
delay in sentencing
Detroit political consultant Sam
Riddle is seeking a delay in his sen-
tence for corruption.
Riddle is due in federal court
today. But lawyer Richard Conver-
tino wants a judge to hold a hearing
to determine how Riddle's state-
ments to investigators were used
to calculate the value of political
payoffs.
Convertino says Riddle's rights
may have been violated.
Riddle pleaded guilty in May to
conspiracy, a charge that covered
his crimes with then-Detroit coun-
cilwoman Monica Conyers and a
Southfield councilman. Prosecu-
tors are recommending 37 months
in prison.
The government accused Riddle
and Conyers of shaking down busi-
nesses for thousands of dollars.
Riddle's former companion, Mary
Waters, faces sentencing for a mis-
demeanor tax offense.
TRAVERSE CITY, Mich.
Canada joins U.S. in
Asian carp research.
Canadian and U.S. scientists
announced yesterday the launch
of a joint study that will look at
the likelihood that Asian carp will
spread across the Great Lakes and
decimate the fish populations if
allowed to gain a foothold.
The 18-month study will be the
first joint effort by the two nations
to evaluate possible consequences
of an invasion by bighead and silver
carp -Asian species threateningcto
enter Lake Michigan through Chi-
cago-ares rivers and canals.
"We have seen the destructive
behavior" of Asian carp in parts
of the Mississippi and Illinois riv-
ers, where they have disrupted the
food web by hogging the plankton
on which many fish depend, said
Becky Cudmore, senior research
scientist for Fisheries and Oceans
Canada. "We are not taking the
threat to the Great Lakes lightly."
Canadian researchers produced
an initial assessment in 2004 and
U.S. experts did likewise the fol-
lowing year. The new project will
aim to resolve differences between
them while yielding new informa-
tion about the carp threat, said
Marc Gaden, spokesman for the
Great Lakes Fishery Commission.

permission by the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals to present their

viewpoints.
Brewer's lawyers told the
appeals court that the opinions of
foreign countries have no bearing
on whether the law is constitu-
tional.

were meddling in a domestic legal
dispute.
Mexico was joined in its brief by

President Barack Obama is

Scores of ambassadors and
other foreign officials were invit-
ed to the East Room yesterday for
cocktails and hors d'oeuvres at an
annual diplomatic corps recep-
tion. Appearing with first lady
Michelle Obama, the president
told his guests that in a world that's
more interconnected than ever, it's

Obama said the governments
were working together on global
economic growth, confronting vio-
lent extremism, securing nuclear
weapons and achieving peace from
the Middle East to Sudan.

Times Square bomber sentenced to life

Shahzad warns of
more attacks in
future from Al Qaeda
NEW YORK (AP) - The Paki-
stani immigrant who tried to deto-
nate a car bomb on a busy Saturday
night in Times Square accepted a
life sentence with a smirk yester-
day and warned that Americans
can expect more bloodshed at the
hands of Muslims.
"Brace yourselves, because the
war with Muslims has justbegun,"
31-year-old Faisal Shahzad told a
federal judge. "Consider me the
first droplet of the blood that will
follow."
His punishment for building the
propane-and-gasoline bomb and
driving it into the heart of the city
in an SUV in May was a foregone
conclusion, since the charges to
which he pleaded guilty carried
a mandatory life sentence, which
under federal rules will keep him
behind bars until he dies.
But the former budget analyst
from Connecticut used the court-
room appearance to rail against
the U.S., saying the country will
continue to pay for occupying
Muslim countries.
"We are only Muslims trying
to defend our religion, people,
homes and land, but if you call us
terrorists, then we are proud ter-
rorists and we will keep on terror-
izing you until you leave our lands
and people at peace," he told U.S.
District Judge Miriam Goldman
Cedarbaum.
Shahzad - brought into the

courtroom in handcuffs, and wear-
ing a long beard and white skull-
cap - had instructed his attorney
not to speak, and Cedarbaum told
prosecutors she didn't need to hear
from them.
That left the two free to spar
over his reasoning for giving up his
comfortable life in America to train
in Pakistan and carry out an attack
authorities say could have killed an
untold number of pedestrians.
"You appear to be someone who
was capable of education and I do
hope you will spend some of the
time in prison thinking carefully
about whether the Quran wants
you to kill lots of people," Cedar-
baum said.
Shahzad responded that the
"Quran gives us the right to defend.
And that's all I'm doing."
The judge cut him off at one
point to ask if he had sworn alle-
giance to the U.S. when he became
a citizen last year.
"I did swear, but I did not mean
it," Shahzad said.
In his address to the court, he
said Osama bin Laden "will be
known as no less than Saladin of
the 21st-century crusade" - a ref-
erence to the Muslim hero of the
Crusades. He also said: "If I'm
given 1,000 lives, I will sacrifice
them all."
Shahzad smirked when the
judge imposed the sentence. Asked
if he had any final words, he said,
"I'm happy with the deal that God
has given me."
Afterward, the head of the FBI's
New York office, Janice K. Fedar-
cyk, cited evidence that Shahzad
hoped to strike more than once.

This June 29, 2010 photo taken from video and provided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation shows an FBI-staged explosion
in Osceola Mills, Pa., that prosecutors say replicates the power of the car bomb Faisal Shahzad tried to detonate in New York's
Tiwes Square on May 1, 2010.

"Shahzad built a mobile weapon
of mass destruction and hoped and
intended that it would kill large
numbers of innocent people and
planned to do it again two weeks
later," Fedarcyk said in a state-
ment. "The sentence imposed
today means Shahzad will never
pose that threat again."
U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara
called Shahzad a "remorseless ter-
rorist who betrayed his adopted
country."
"We have tobe concerned about
homegrown terrorists given recent

events. We're working as hard as
we can to make sure we don't have
another event like that," Bharara
said.
White House spokesman Nick
Shapiro said the administration
was pleased with the sentencing.
"We tried the case in a civilian
court, we were able to use every-
thing that he said and everything
that we uncovered for intelligence
collection purposes," he said. "His
trial served no propaganda pur-
pose for al-Qaida, and only under-
scored the strength of our justice

system."
Calling himself a Muslim sol-
dier, Shahzad pleaded guilty in
June to 10 terrorism and weapons
counts. He said the Pakistan Tal-
iban provided him with more than
$15,000 and five days of explosives
training late last year and early
this year, months after he became
a U.S. citizen.
For greatest impact, he chose a
crowded a section of Times Square
by studying an online streaming
video of the so-called Crossroads
of the World, prosecutors said.


Survey: Latinos
still strongly
support Dems.

U.S. seeks vote on Russian
nuclear arms pact summit

Some say
immigration issues
may influence more
Latinos to vote
WASHINGTON (AP) - In a
year when Democrats are strug-
gling to energize supporters,
Hispanic voters appear signifi-
cantly less motivated than the
rest of.the U.S. to cast election
ballots even though two-thirds
of Latino registered voters say
they'll vote Democratic in their
congressional race, a Pew His-
panic Center study found.
The center's national survey,
released Tuesday, found 51 per-
cent of Latino registered voters
were absolutely certain they
would vote - compared with 70
percent of U.S. voters - and 65
percent of Latino voters planned
to support the Democrat in their
congressional district, com-
pared with 47 percent of U.S.
voters.
They are pledging that sup-
port even though only 26 percent
of the voters said the policies
of President Barack Obama's
administration have helped Lati-
nos. Thirteen percent said the
administration's policies hurt
Latinos, while 51 percent said
they had no effect.
"The Latino vote appears to
continue to strongly identify
with the Democratic Party," said
Mark Lope, Pew Hispanic Cen-
ter's associate director.
A51percentLatinovoter turn-
out would be a slight increase in
turnout over 2008. But midterm
turnout for all voters generally is
lower than in presidential years.
In 2006, about 32 percent of eli-
gible Latino voters showed up at
the polls.
"Even though they say they
plan to vote, many things may
get in the way of actually turning
out to vote," Lope said.
About 19.3 million Latinos, the
nation's largest minority group,
are eligible to vote, Pew Hispan-
ic estimates. Two of every three
live in California, Texas, Florida
or New York.
Latinos voted more than 2-to-
1 for Obama in 2008. But the
sagging economy and outrage
among some voters has the Dem-
ocratic Party concerned about
a general apathy among its core
supporters and some newer and
independent voters.
Latino voter turnout is gen-
erally lower than for U.S. reg-
istered voters overall. But
the Latino share of all voters
increased from 6 percent in 2004
to 7.4 percent in 2008, according
to Pew Hispanic's data. Nearly
half of Itino eligible voters say

they voted in 2008.
Some have suggested Latino
voters would stay home because
of lack of action on immigration
reform legislation by the Obama
administration. However, an
Arizona immigrationlaw and the
Obama administration's attempt
to thwart may also serve as ral-
lying points for get-out-the-vote
drives among Latinos.
Ben Monterroso, executive
director of Mi Familia Vota, said
his group is targeting new Lati-
no voters in Texas, Arizona and
Colorado who are less likely go
vote. Mi Familia Vota is a group
trying to increase Latino voting
numbers.
"Neighborhoods where we
are working, from Houston to
Phoenix, Yuma to Denver, we
have seen the Latino community
being interested in the elections
out of the outrage" over Arizo-
na's immigration law and anger
over largely Republican votes
against legislation that would
have given many young people
brought to the country illegally
by their parents a chance to
become legal U.S. residents.
Immigration did not rank as a
top voting issue for Latino regis-
tered voters in the Pew Hispanic
survey. It came in fifth behind
education, jobs, health care and
the federal budget deficit.
But two-thirds of registered
Latino voters say that have talk-
ed about the immigration issue
with someone they know in the
past year. Those who had were
more motivated to vote, the sur-
vey found.
The Pew Hispanic Center's
survey also found:
-Thirty-eight percent of Lati-
no voters whose primary lan-
guage is Spanish are absolutely
certain to vote this year.
-Republican Latino regis-
tered voters are more likely than
Democratic Latino registered
voters to say they have given the
election quite a lot of thought, 44
percent versus 28 percent.
-Among Latino registered
voters who identify with or lean
toward the Republican Party,
18 percent say the GOP is better
for Latinos than the Democratic
Party, while 60 percent say they
see no difference.
The Pew Hispanic Center
survey is based on telephone
interviews done Aug. 17 through
Sept. 19 by Social Science
Research Solutions (SSRS) with
1,375 Latinos ages 18 and older.
Of those surveyed, 618 were reg-
istered voters. Some interviews
were conducted in Spanish. The
margin of sampling error is plus
or minus 3.3 percentage points
for the sample of all Latinos,
plus or minus 4.88 for registered
Voters.

U.S. wants similar
action as 1992
START Treaty
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The
Obama administration is hoping for
an overwhelming Senate vote this
year to ratify the new arms control
treaty with Russia, the chief U.S.
negotiator said yesterday.
Rose Gottemoeller said chances
for ratification of the New START
Treaty in the "lame duck" session
after the November midterm elec-
tions are "good."
She pointed to the 14-4 bipar-
tisan vote in the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee last month
which sent the treaty to the full
Senate, and the administration's

efforts to build support including
answering about 900 questions
from senators and holding 18 hear-
ings and four major briefings.
Gottemoeller recalled that the
1992 START treaty to reduce the
nuclear arsenals of the United
States and then Soviet Union was
the last major treaty ratified by the
Senate on Oct. 1, 1992.
"We are hoping that we will
have the same kind of vote which
was the vote for the START treaty,
95-0 against," she said. "We're
looking for that kind of vote this
time around as well."
Gottemoeller, the assistant sec-
retary of state for arms control,
verification and compliance, spoke
to reporters after addressing the
U.N. General Assembly's disarma-
ment committee where she said

that in addition to pressing for a
vote "as soon as possible," the U.S.
wants to begin negotiations on a
treaty to ban production of atomic
bomb material and try again to rat-
ify the nuclear testban treaty.
Progress on the New START
treaty has been slow since Presi-
dent Barack Obama and Rus-
sian President Dmitry Medvedev
signed it in April. It would reduce
the limit on strategic warheads to
1,550 for each country from the
current ceiling of 2,200. It also
would set new procedures that
allow both countries to inspect
each other's arsenals to verify
compliance.
When Gottemoeller was asked
whether there were any chances
for the treaty to be ratified this
year, she replied: "Absolutely, yes."

Big benefits in nanotech
'U' and federal government should invest in research
J nrthe wake of cuts to state funding on higher education facil-
ities across the state, the University received some uplift-
ing and positive news - a nanomechanical engineering lab
complex will be built on North Campus by 2013. The new lab,
called The Center of Excellence in Nano Mechanical Science and
Engineering, will be home to a nanotechnology research project.
It will focus on progress in healthcare and biotechnology, among
other areas. When the facility is complete, it will have the poten-
tial to greatly benefit the University and the state. The Univer-
sity and the federal government should continue to invest in this
project and other similar lab projects.

Relax and have a beer

According to a Sept. 29 article in the Daily,
the University received a $9.5 million grant
from the National Institute of Standards
and Technology to dedicate to the creation
of a $46-million nanomechanical engineer-
ing lab complex on North Campus. In addi-
tion to the federal grant, the University, the
College of Engineering and private pledges
will also contribute to the lab's funding.
Jack Hu, the organizer behind the original
proposal and the associate dean for academ-
ic affairs in engineering, noted in an inter-
view with the Daily that the new facility
will contribute in vital nanoparticles behav-
ioral research that will benefit the medical
and manufacturing fields.
The potential benefits of The Center of
Excellence in Nano Mechanical Science and
Engineering and similar research efforts
are too im ortant to be ignored. The oppor-
tunity to further commit to research could
have the potential to have many tangible
benefits for generations to come. In this
case, research devoted to furthering the
advancedelnts in'the medical field could'
lead to scientific breakthroughs that actu-
ally save lives. For example, nanotechnol-
ogycould help to better detect and diagnose
several types of cancer, as well as create
new treatments, according to the Project on
Emerging Nanotechnologies.
Research could also prove to be a helpful

investment for the state as well. As Gov. Jen-
nifer Granholm said ina press release about
the buildings' creation last week, the new
lab complex could help diversify our state
economy as well as create new jobs. And
these benefits are exactly what our state
needs as it faces a high unemployment rate
and an uncertain future. This facility is just
one way to help revitalize state employment
by encouraging the growth of the research
industry and drawing esteemed researchers
and scientists to Michigan.
Not only is the creation of this lab com-
plex beneficial to the state, but it could
also encourage and add to the growth of
research at the University. With the open-
ing of this new facility, the University will
have the opportunity to broaden the scope
of its research. This lab complex could draw
researchers to the University. In turn, this
influx of researchers could improve the
speed of research progress. This win-win
situation will lead to impressive technologi-
cal and medical breakthroughs.
The University has shown its commit-
ment to research. And now, the federal gov-
ernment has demonstrated its support, too.
But furthering advancements in research
shouldn't end here. The University and fed-
eral government should continue to invest
in research developments that will lead to
valuable real-world benefits.

n his column about combat-
ing underage drinking three
weeks ago, Tyler Jones referred
to alcohol as a
"crutch" that stu-
dents shouldn't
have to rely on to
manage stress or
social situations
(The battle for State
Street, 09/17/2010).
And while colum-
nist Joe Sugiyama
showed a better JEREMY
understanding of
college life in his LEVY
response column
the following week,
he didn't outright refute the idea of
alcohol as a crutch (It's a sober world
after all..., 09/21/2010).
If you asked the authors of a recent
study entitled "Late-Life Alcohol Con-
sumption and 20-Year Mortality,"
they'd likely tell you that alcohol has
very tangible social benefits, and is far
from a crutch
in most cases.
In a sample of
1,824 partici-
pants between,
ages 55 and 65
over a= study
period of 20
years, the
study found
higher mor-
tality rates for
non-drinkers
than for heavy
drinkers.
Yes, you
read cor-
rectly. The
study showed
that moder-
ate drinkers
had the low-
est mortal-
ity, while
heavy drink-
ers - defined
as those who
drink three drinks or more a day on
average - also showed lower mortal-
ity rates than abstainers. The authors
attributed the difference in mortality
rates to the social differences between
drinkers and non-drinkers. Non-
drinkers were more likely to suffer
from depression, isolation or other
mental health issues.
Granted, this study should be
taken with a grain of salt. While the
findings in favor of moderate drink-
ing were robust, the authors didn't

go as far as to say that the social ben-
efits of binge drinking outweigh the
health problems.
Still, the study can serve as evidence
that drinking - and not just moderate
drinking - holds a legitimate social
role in many aspects of our society,
including college. To borrow a term
from sociology, drinking under the age
of 21 may be technically illegal, but it's
by no means socially deviant. In other
words, it's more common for a college
student to drink than abstain. This pat-
tern has a lot to do with the prevalence
of alcohol in all aspects of our culture
- and contrary to Jones's view, that's
not necessarily bad. Drinking among
college age kids isn't an epidemic, as
some public officials want us to believe.
It's just normal.
In this vein, there's a major con-
tradiction between what students
are taught about alcohol and how it's
actually perceived in society. At least
among adults I know, there's ageneral
consensus that to a certain degree,

Just take a moment to think about
the role of alcohol in society. How
many beer commercials do you see on
a dailybasis? Try and count the num-
ber of adult social events - fancy din-
ners, bar nights, high school reunions
- that involve alcohol. Even at many
religious gatherings, drinking is the
custom. Alcohol is prevalent in many
aspects of social life and it's simply
naive to think that those under 21
aren't going to partake.
Of course, I realize that alcohol can
be extremely dangerous when con-
sumed irresponsibly. I agree that the
number of late night hospital visits
from underage kids due to drinking is
unacceptable. But college students are
disproportionally lectured about the
dangers of drinking, even though they
are not necessarily the most endan-
gered. According to the Center for
Disease Control, of all fatal car crashes
in 2008 in which the person who died
had a BAC above .08, 34 percent were
21 to 24 years old, 31 percent were 25
to 34 years old
and 25 percent
were between
35 and44years
'I ~ - old. The 18-to-
21 age group
isn't even in
the top three.
Yet, a slogan
like "Mothers
Against Thir-
ty-Year Olds
Drinking" just
doesn't have
o the same ring
r': to it.
But 5 don't
think irre-
sponsible
- drinking is
what we're
really talking
about here.
The subject is
agencies like
The National
Institute of
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism that
claim that it's a problem that 83 per-
cent of college students drink at all,
or those who argue that alcohol is
an unnecessary crutch. Ultimately,
these are the same groups that argue
for stricter, ineffective law enforce-
ment of underage drinking and fail to
see the realities of alcohol's place in
social life and it's potential benefits.

drinking at a young age isn't a prob-
lem. Many adults tend to be okay with
high school students drinking in con-
trolled situations, such as family func-
tions, and for the most part know that
college students are going to drink
underage. Most of our parents prob-
ably drank when they were in college,
and for some of them, the drinking age
in their state was 18 at the time. These
perceptions stand in sharp contrast to
the hyperbolic messages we receive
from public sources.

When I wrote a viewpoint coming out in The
Michigan Daily during my freshman year (Com-
ing out for acceptance, 03/04/2009), I received a
lot of e-mails and comments from people, both
good and bad. Some congratulated me, while
others told me that I was going to burn in Hell.
I knew there was a risk to coming out in such a
public way, but I believed that if I could help
anyone feel comfortable with who they are or to
realize that others were going through what they
were, it was worth it. I honestly didn't expect
the criticisms from people who never met me -
or ever cared to for that matter - but for every
person telling me that I was wrong or disgusting,
two others were asking for advice or telling me
that reading the article was helpful.
I'm sure everyone has heard the recent news
about Andrew Shirvell, an assistant attor-
ney general for the state of Michigan, and his
open attacks on Michigan Student Assembly
President Chris Armstrong. I'm not here to
give you a recap or rewrite all the unprovoked,
malicious statements this grown man is mak-
ing about a college student. My point is to tell
Shirvell and anyone who agrees with his meth-
ods and beliefs that the student body of the
University stands behind Armstrong. The work
he has been doing to make the campus a more
inclusive place for all students, no matter how
they identify themselves, is something to be
commended, not met with bigotry. I'm tired of
sitting back and letting someone attack one of
my peers for being openly gay and for trying to
makea difference on campus.
I started hearing about Shirvell and his blog
"Chris Armstrong Watch" a while back, but I
chose to avoid reading it because I figured the
whole situation would soon blow over and he
would realize that cyber-bullying a college stu-
dent isn't be the best way to spend one's time

and energy. I was wrong.
As the publicity increased, and with "The
Daily Show" on campus's steps, I knew it was
time to read what was being said about the
person I voted to represent me and my school.
I was outraged by his callous assumptions and
so-called "reporting," which looked much more
like stalking to me. Yet, despite the public back-
lash, Shirvell still holds a position of power in
the Michigan attorney general's office.
I would like to congratulate Armstrong for
taking these personal attacks with maturity and
coolness. Armstrong, having expressed his inten-
tions to continue with what Shirvell calls his
"radical homosexual agenda" and enact the pro-
posals that prompted the studentbody to vote for
him (such as the much-needed open housing and
that oh-so-radical cafeteria hours extension, as
noted by Anderson Cooper in his interview with
Shirvell last Tuesday), is showing that he won't
be silenced or scared into submission.
I think Armstrong is setting an example that
we all, as future leaders, should follow: Stand up
for what you believe in. Fight for your rights and
the rights of all those around you. I also think
it's important to understand that, while it's hor-
rible to think in this day and age that people
can still be so condemning of members of the
LGBTQ community, the national attention that
this affair is receiving can only help the fight for
gay rights by putting a spotlight on MSA's work
and the progress it's trying to make.
As the University "Expect Respect" campaign
says, "I expect respect for myself and my com-
munity." So speak up and show the world that the
University supports its student body president
and won't sit idly by while he is attacked and bul-
lied for who he is and what he believes in.

State redistricting process is flawed

As a newspaper reporter for more than a decade, Ihad the
chance to cover nearly every level of government, from Con-
gress and the Supreme Court to the Pinckney Village Coun-
cil. One of the greatest joys of that work was interviewing
the "man/woman on the street" to gather the general pub-
lic's thoughts on the political issue of the day.
One of the inescapable conclusions of talking to so many
people about so many different topics is that the level of
consensus on politics in America - that is, agreement
among the actual people, not politicians - is surprisingly
high. I would wager that most people agree on most things
(excluding some seemingly intractable issues like abor-
tion rights). Sm convinced that a non-dogmatic, centrist
approach to government is what most people want.
Now, however, polarization is the order of the day. Grid-
lock in Washington, demonization of one or the other side
by TV, radio and Internet pundits and the infusion of great-
er and greater amounts of cash into political campaigns
have combined to create a toxic political atmosphere.
One often-overlooked contributor to these divisions is
the current practice of redrawing political districts every 10
years based on the decennial census. Ina classic case of the
fox guarding the henhouse, the job of redistricting is tasked
to the state legislature. The very people who would benefit
from drawing the lines to create "safe" districts - districts
so heavily populated by voters of one party that the other
party's candidates essentially have no chance of winninga
general election - are the ones who actually get to do it.
The result is a system in which politicians have absolute-
ly no incentive to appeal to the center. That's because in a
safe district, all a candidate has to do is win the primaryand
he or she is virtually guaranteed to win the general elec-
tion. So all they have to do is win over their party's primary
voters, generally a more hard-line group than the electorate
as a whole, at least in my experience.
Perhaps a more troubling effect is the disparity between
the voting preferences of the electorate and the makeup of
our Congressional delegation. For example, in Michigan,
according to a 2 07 report from the Michan Campaign

Finance Network, 49.2 percent of votes in the 1998 Con-
gressional elections were cast for Democrats. But because *
the party had drawn the districts after the 1990 census,
10 of Michigan's 16 seats in the House, more than 62 per-
cent, were held by Democrats. After Republicans drew the
districts following the 2000 census, an equal and opposite
situation emerged: In the 2006 election, 44.5 percent of the
Congressional vote went to Republicans, but they ended up
with 9 of the 15 seats, or60 percent. If this isn't a subversion
of the will of the voters, I don't know what is.
This issue has gained some attention this year, as vari-
ous media outlets have written about how high the stakes
are in this election cycle. In effect, the winners of this
election will control each states' political scene for the
next 10 years. Michigan stands to lose one of its Congres-
sional seats because of our population loss. For the most
part, however, these media accounts fail to point out the
ridiculousness of the system in which political partisans
essentially get to choose their voters, instead of voters
choosing their candidates at the ballot box.
Ann Arbor residents have a great opportunity to learn
more about the issue with the screening of a new, unre-
leased documentary called "Gerrymandering." A special
showing of "Gerrymandering" is set for 7 p.m., Oct. 6 at
the University's Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy on
State Street. Writer/director Jeff Reichert will attend and
participate in a panel discussion after the showing with
University Professor John Chamberlin, former U.S. Rep.
Joe Schwarz (R-Mich.) and Rich Robinson of the Michi-
gan Campaign Finance Network.
Reichert will also attend a fundraiser in Detroit for
Common Cause of Michigan, which is making redistrict-
ing reform one of its top issues this year.
Other states, notably Iowa, have implemented non-par-
tisan systems of redistricting. It can be done. And if we
want to take positive actionto overcome the artificial divi-
sions plaguing our political system, it should be done.

Lucy vWainrign socne releases ner first frl-lengn album on uct. 2
Roche folks The Ark

By ARIELLE SPECINER
DailyArts Writer
Though her family name may
bring her recognition, Lucy Wain-
wright Roche is
certainly break- Lucy
ing out on her Wa.
ownin
In prepara- Roche
tion for her stop
in Ann Arbor, Tonight at
Roche - a folk 8 p.m.
musician known The Ark
for her candid- Tickets from $21.50
ly funny stage
demeanor - spoke with the Daily
about her famous family (half-
brother Rufus, father Loudon and
mother Suzzy Roche), asserting
that they won't influence her as
she blossoms into a new artist.
"We're all in the same business,
everyone is very supportive of
each other. And also, we're all very
different from each other, so that
kind of allows us to each have our
own thing," Roche said.
Since most of her family con-
sists of singer-songwriters like
herself, Roche grew up on the
road, and her nomadic life heavily
influences her songwriting. Her
first full-length album, LUCY,
which will be released Oct. 28,
recounts her days on tour with
her family as well as her travels as
a solo singer.
"There are a lot of different
songs about different places. I
think that's a reflection of how
long I've been away from home for
the past couple of years," Roche
explained.
-While Roche enjoys touring, she

does admit to being homesick.
"I miss being home sometimes,
but I don't think I would trade all
the things that have happened to
me on the road and the people that
I've met," she said.
And shehas metsome incredible
people. Roche has been co-billed
with fellow singer-songwriter and
friend Antje Duvekot at many tour
stops and will be opening for the
Indigo Girls in a few weeks start-
ing in New Hampshire. She has
also shared the stage with some of
her relatives.
"I've been really lucky to get to
open for lots of different artists
and share the stage with lots of
different people and that's one of
the highlights of this whole career
so far," she said.
Though she is just starting out,
Roche has earned a good deal of
praise.
Ira Glass of National Public
Radio compared her to the likes of
Joni Mitchell and Patti Griffin.
Seeming flabbergasted by the
compliment; Roche responded,
"It's so amazing, I can hardly
believe that it was said. I'm cer-
tainly flattered, it's a great com-
parison and I'm honored to be
compared to either one of them."
However, she refuses to be con-
fined to those judgments.
"I think that my personality and
my music is pretty specific to who
I am. There may be parts of me
that's certainly been influenced by
people ... like Joni Mitchell or Patti
Griffin or even my family mem-
bers. But really at the end of the
day, you kind of end up being who
you are naturally, too."

'My Designs Inside
Your Body' looks at
the aesthetics and
culture of food
By PROMA KHOSLA
For the Daily
While interactive art exhibi-
tions are becoming increasingly
popular, few end with patrons
actually con-
suming the ..
pieces on dis- die
play. Among Vogezang:
these few are yAufl m
the designs of
Marije Vogel- Inside Your
zang, Dutch
food designer
and upcoming Tomorrow at
lecturer in the 5:10 p.m.
School of Art & Michigan Theater
Design's Penny
Stamps Speak-
er Series. Vogelzang specializes
in food design, a field in which
artists prepare and arrange food
to be aesthetically pleasing.
Through her catering company,
Proef, Vogelzang simultaneously
creates exhibitions and meals.
"I'm educated to be a product
designer, but I decided to choose
food as my preferred material,"
Vogelzang wrote in an e-mail
interview with the Daily. "When
working with food I noticed that
it has so much effect on the world
around us and ourselves."
Vogelzang considers herself
an "eating designer" rather than
a food designer, because she
believes "food is already perfectly
designed by nature." As an eating
designer, Vogelzang is more con-
cerned with food's origin, prepa-
ration, etiquette, history and
culture. She tries to find unusual
combinations and methods of pre-
paring her pieces, which range
from hors d'oeuvres to full meals. _.

Marije Vogelzang makes interactive art you can eat.

She focuses on the verb "to eat"
and the ways it can be manipu-
lated.
"I work on food related proj-
ects like restaurant concepts,
dinners, hospital projects, inspi-
ration sessions, food industry and
try to make simple creative ideas
that respect food," Vogelzang
explained.
One of Vogelzang's favorite
projects was a recreation of World
War II recipes served to people
who survived the Rotterdam
Hunger Winter during the war.
Though many of the guests were
so old they could no longer taste
food, the look and feel of Vogel-
zang's recipes stimulated their

memories from more than 60
years ago.
"Another one that I like is a
project to get children to eat vege-
tables," Vogelzang added. "I invit-
ed 12 kids to my studio and told
them we were going to make jew-
elry out of vegetables. The main
tools they could use were their
teeth. The children were making
their jewelry and were ... chew-
ing away lots of vegetables that
they stated before they didn't like.
The emphasis was on playing. Not
on eating. Secretly they ate and
accepted the taste."
In her 10 years of integrat-
ing art and food, Vogelzang has'
found that the right eating design.

can benefit the mind and heart as
well as the body. She has devel-
oped her own set of criteria for
her company's eating design,
working with eight points - the
senses, nature, culture, society,
technique, psychology, science
and action - to stimulate the
brain and emotions.
"When working with food,
naturally you work with the
senses. But more important is the
story behind it, the story that I
want to tell. Sometimes it's about
where the food comes from or
what it does to yourbody or how
food makes you communicate

No Age screws
up 'Ever ything'

Glitz, glamour, justice

Lo-fi production
can't obscure
uneven songwriting
By JOSHUA BAYER
Daily Arts Writer
Out of all the do-it-yourself,
scrappier-is-better trash pop out-
fits infesting
the indie scene *
nowadays, gui-
tar-and-drum No4Age
duo No Age is E
probably the Evethin
most interesting.
But, as a mild Sub Pop
disclaimer, this
ongoing movement of fanboy-as-
artist is probably one of the least
interesting trends in indie rock
since - possibly - ever. While "lo-
fi" recordings certainly have their
rugged charm, poor production
value is never a substitute for solid
songwriting. And the majority of
the music pumping outof this trend
is little more than least-common-
denominator garage fuzz.
With 2008's Nouns, No Age
transcended pigeonholing, nailing
a magnetic balance between punk-
influenced thrashing and shoe-
gazey brainwashing. Everything
In Between, No Age's latest, is still
less vanilla than your average io-fi
outing, but finds the band trying to
squeeze a poppier, more condensed
product out of its raw, color-out-
side-the-lines aesthetic. And, from
the sound of it, it's clear that No Age
isn't quite ready for the big leagues
just yet.
"Life Prowler" kicks things off
with an incessantly pulsing drum
machine, paving the way for a
scratchy-but-harmless wave of
single-minded guitar riffs while
synth sirens tack on a forced air of
synthetic dreaminess. Meanwhile,
vocalist Dean Spunt sings vaguely
profound lyrics that read like for-
tune cookie prophecies: "One time
is all I need / to know my job's
complete / and when J reach into
/ myself, my past comes true." The
whole thing feels like a cookie-
cutter projection of genuine intro-

spection, and the shruggy chord
progressions sound lazy rather
than restrained.
"Common Heat," No Age's crack
at a ballad, follows in this same vein
of prescribed "intimacy." The song
strikes an alluringly sandy texture
with fast-picked acoustic guitar and
insistent shaker, but Spunt's snotty
warble doesn't bode well for the
band's newfound mode of breezy
faux-earnestness: "I get myself up
to go to work / But I can't find my
cleanest shirt / There's no way I can
get out of bed now." The track's juve-
nile vibe echoes Best Coast's petty
couch-bum moping, but minus all
the droll self-awareness - Spunt
just sounds like he's whining.
Elsewhere, No Age proves it can
still crank up the volume ... but also
write incredibly pedestrian shred-
a-thons. "Fever Dream" coasts on
the same facile four-second riff for
three-and-a-half minutes, tossing
in a few of the band's signature gui-
tar-as-migraine feedback screech-
es for sorely needed variety. While
the hangnail aggression certainly
gets the blood pumping, the track
exemplifies the record's repetitive-
ness.

"Skinned" is even less fun, with
Spunt sneering out of tune over
midtempo power chords and junk-
yard snare battering that's more
grating than constructively abra-
sive. The band seems to be "rein-
ing it in" from spontaneously shifty
noise collages to a more refined
blend of slacker rock, but the record
is far too in-your-face to feel believ-
ably apathetic. Instead, No Age just
sounds like it's trying way too hard
to sound like itself.
"Depletion" and "Shred and
Transcend" both feature white-hot
guitar solos, but these moments
of searing precision mainly just
serve to emphasize the structural
asphyxiation on the rest of the
album.
. "Glitter" is the only real stand-
out, with distorted guitars gouging
out drama over a tight rhythm of
jock-jam drum machine claps and
monkey-sprung snare fills, empha-
sizing the utter lack of tension on
the rest of the album.
Rather than delivering the more
mature, more calculated album
that No Age clearly intended, the
band inadvertently flashed us its
baby teeth.

" Mich. film office: Over $300 mllion
wil- be spent in state on films this year

From Page 1A
only two-years old," said Kozak.
The company has provided
shirts for movies such as "Stone"
and "Sunset Boulevard," Kozak
said, adding that this summer it
also provided $6,000 worth of
shirts for "Scream 4" and did a
personalized order for director
Wes Craven.
Michelle Begnoche, the com-
munications advisor for the
Michigan Film Office, said that
this year's in-state production
expenditures will be more than
$300 million from more than 40
films. She added that in 2007 the
state of Michigan produced three
films with only $2 million spent
in production.
As more production compa-
nies are beginning to see the
benefits of shooting in Michigan,
the quality of the films produced
in the state is increasing as well.
HOUSING
From Page 1A
These popular areas are filled
with many houses and apartment
complexes. Pasthistoryfromthese
realtors has shown the houses are
the most likely to sign earliest in
the year, while one- and two-bed-
room apartments tend still to be
available later in the year.
"Larger units, such as three
bedrooms and up, see their most
interest earlier in the school year,"
Traband wrote. "Demand for
two bedrooms and below follows
toward the end of the fall term."
Prime Student Housing, which
leases apartments, reported that it
sees a rush to rent properties both
at the beginning and at the end of
the school year.
"As it gets later on people will
wait until the last minute and not
rent in the middle of our leasing

involved," Steele said.
Careless government spend-
ing is putting today's youth in an
increasingly dangerous position,
Steele said because today's young
people will be saddled with the
nation's debt in the future.
"Most parents wouldn't go out
and buy a big screen TV and a
motor home and then charge it to
their kids," Steele said. "Your par-
ents wouldn't do that, I wouldn't
do that to my children, and so why
should we allow the government
to do the same thing?"
Furman, too, wrote in an e-mail
interview that the federal govern-
ment needs to curb its current
levels of spending, which is a key
ideal of the U.S. Taxpayers Party
of Michigan.
"I believe that with lower taxes
and less of their paychecks being
confiscated by the government,
individuals and families can save,
spend, and invest as they see fit,
and business can expand, grow,
and hire, thereby growing the
economy," Furman wrote. "There
you have the difference between
liberal policies and common sense
policies."
Furman, who's currently train-

ing in a police academy, wrote that
he feels Dingell has advocated "a
liberal, socialist agenda that has
pushed America to the breaking
point," which has caused a huge
national deficit.
"I am campaigning for Con-
gress to help restore America to
her founding principles of lim-

Burnstein said that five films shot
in Michigan were entered into
the Toronto Film Festival last
year, three of which were shot in
Ann Arbor.
The tax incentive is not only
beneficial to the state economi-
cally but also socially. Both Beg-
noche and Burnstein emphasized
the gravity of Michigan's "brain
drain" and hope the increased
film production will keep young
people in the state.
"When we passed the law,
migration of students to L.A. and
New York stopped," Burnstein
said. "It's got alot of young people
to want to stay here."
Michigan's increased screen
time has also helped its morale,
said Burnstein. Troubles with
the auto industry prior to the
passing of the law caused many
Michigan residents to lose con-
fidence in their state. Burnstein
said that the film industry may

have helped reverse that effect.
He said he believes Clint East-
wood's movie "Grand Torino,"
which was filmed in Detroit, was
a significant turning point that
helped instill a sense of pride in
Michiganders.
"A perception of ourselves
began to change with all of these
bright lights," said Burnstein.
Ann Arbor has been a hot spot
for Michigan film production.
Stars such as Michael Cera, Clive
Owen, Hayden Panettiere and
Hilary Swank have all been to
Ann Arbor to film since the law
passed.
"Answer This!" a comedy
filmed this year in Ann Arbor and
which will be premiering at the
Michigan Theatre on Friday, has
even deeper roots in this city. It
was directed by University alum
Chris Farah. Farah said that it
was his dream to film here in Ann
Arbor and the tax incentive made

it possible.
"Without the incentives, we.
really wouldn't have been able
to make it here," Farah said. "It's
pure economics."
Farah added that though
Michigan is now a competitor
with Tinseltown, it still lacks
the cinema infrastructure of Los
Angeles. His team had issues
finding a certain crane for his
cameras, which he said could
have been found within minutes
in Hollywood.
Though Michigan isn't quite
Hollywood, these incentives have
certainly aided many film pro-
ducers. Begnoche said that films
can receive up to a 40-percent
credit if they meet certain quali-
fications and hire enough Michi-
gan residents to work for their
films.
"You need to have that kind of
incentive to come shoot in Michi-
gan," said Farah.

TEXTBOOKS
From Page 1A
"Open textbooks offer a wide
range of affordable, flexible
options, including printable PDFs
and files that can be read on acom-
puter or smartphone," Allen said.
But University professors sound
more skeptical.
Business School Prof. Jim
Adams said he is concerned with
the flexibility of textbooks that are
only online, in comparison to hav-
ing the option of buying the hard
copy of the book or accessing read-
ings through C-Tools.
"I myself like to assign primary
documents ... I make all these pub-
lications available both in course-
packs and on C-Tools. That way,
students can choose: pay for the
convenience of a coursepack, or
download yourself," Adams wrote
in an e-mail interview. "For the
courses I teach, until now, Iam not
aware of an online option that is
both available and good."
Statistics Prof. Brenda Gunder-
son wrote in an e-mail interview

that she believes in giving students
multiple ways to access their class
material, including online texts,
e-books, and using the same edi-
tion for texts multiple years in a
row to cut down on costs.
"I am very much in favor of giv-
ing students many options fortheir
textbooks," Gunderson wrote.
Gunderson cited online text-
books as beneficial when they
offer interactive features and cost
less for students.
University students also seem
ambivalent towards using online
textbooks.
LSA freshman Megan Lim said
she prefers traditional print text-
books and readings.
"Online would be good for a
quick resource," Lim said. "But I
prefer (print) books because you
can actually mark and highlight
in it."
LSA junior Nick Manoogian
said he is using an online textbook
right now.
"My French textbook is online,"
Manoogian said. "Financially, it
would be (cheaper), but I think I'd
prefer a hard copy."



season," Traband wrote.
LSA senior Chris Vivian said
he experienced the trauma of not
signing early last year and then
having fewer options to choose
from at the end of the year. He is
living near Hill Street and Main
Street this year.
"I felt the pressure from sign-
ing early," he said. "I had a house
lined up in the fall but when that
fell through my roommates and
I had major difficulties locating
available housing during second
semester."
Though some realtors said
there was some concern that the
economy or construction of new
student high-rises might affect
the housing market, the beginning
of the leasing season has shown no
significant change in the housing
market.
"There hasn't been as much of
a negative effect as I would have
thought," Acuna said. "At first we

were alittle scared. Ourproperties
do offer a different sort of charac-
ter than those high-rises and they
are not necessarily as expensive."
Old Town Realty reports that it
is at 98 percent capacity with its
units this year, and Arch Realty
reported that it has not had prob-
lems with vacancies.
"While we do not see the high-
rises as our direct competition,
we have noticed that rents around
the new high-rise buildings have
increased at an accelerated rate,"
Traband wrote. "Properties in
other areas around campus have
maintained their value and we
have had no issues with vacancy."
And while the off-campus hous-
ing market seems to sustain many
changes and continues to thrive
around campus, residence halls
are also luring back students with
new construction and better living
situations.
"We have noticed particularly

in the past couple of years just
a slight increase in percentage
points of students who want to
return to on-campus housing,"
said Housing Communications
Director Peter Logan. "This is a
function of, probably, the econo-
my... just the overall anticipation
and improvements we've been
making to the residential experi-
ence here."
Ultimately, many students sign
leases for the following year in
September and just accept the
housing race as it is. Shonkoff said
she was able to get a house that
was "absolutely perfect," by sign-
ing her lease early.
"We signed (in) the beginning
of September," she said. "We had
heard that a couple of our friends
had already been looking and we
knew that it was really competi-
tive and wanted to get a jump start
and not have to be scrambling for
a house."

SUSPECT
From Page 1A
arrest, Johnson was read trespass
for the Ann Arbor campus.
Brown said that people being
charged with crimes such as
robbery are usually given bond
conditions at their arraignment
that include a ban from the place
where the crime in question
occurred. Brown said that in
Johnson's case, the judge made no
such provision, but the trespass
read to him upon arrest prohibits
his return to campus.
Brown added that with each
reported sighting of Johnson on
campus, University Police either
did not reach him in time, or he
had moved just off of University
property, outside the jurisdiction
of DPS.
Johnson is often reported as
asking for $20 in order to go to
Flint to see his family or his chil-
dren, according to Brown.
While Brown said that Johnson
is not typically reported as touching
passersby or appearing belligerent,
she said that because he appears to
have crossed the line in the case of
the unarmed robbery, he is a threat
to students on campus.
Brown also said that the danger
of panhandlers becoming more
aggressive wouldn't exist if com-
munity members did not give them
money.

"When people respond to that
begging it enables that activity to
continue," Brown said. "There are
a lot of resources in this commu-
nity for people who are without
jobs or places to go. They don't
need to be on the streets begging
for money."
Brown added that the most
common issue on campus with
those asking for money occurs
when they come into one of the
University buildings and end up
asleep or suspects of larceny.
Annarbor.com reported that
Johnson was involved in 98 City of
Ann Arbor police reports between
January 2001 and August 2007,
including reports of aggressive
panhandling, narcotics possession
and assault and battery.
Johnson has also been reported
in his vehicle asking for money
from people walking by. Brown
said the vehicle is most often
described as a minivan, though
the make and year vary in witness
reports.
Johnson will appear in Washt-
enaw County Court for his pre-
liminary examination on the
charges of unarmed robbery this
afternoon.
The crime alert described the
attacker as a dark-skinned male
in his 30s, about six feet tall, with
a medium build. DPS requested
in the Annarbor.com article to be
contacted if Johnson is seen on
campus.


ited government, freedom, liberty
and fiscal responsibility," Furman
wrote.
By promoting tax cuts and
establishing a lower income tax,
Furman wrote, he hopes to begin
to erase the nation's debt. He said
he believes this will allow Ameri-
can families to better use their
own money without government
interference.
Though it might not seem like a
traditional path to politics, Steele
said his work as a doctor has pre-
pared him to be a politician in
many ways because he knows
how to handle difficult situations
and address important issues in a
timely fashion.
"We have career politicians
who aren't frankly that interested
in fixing the problems," Steele
said. "They're perfectly willing to
kick it down the road to the next
person just as long as they can get
re-elected this time."
Steele said he also hopes to
improve what he calls "account-
ability," or ensuring that every
person in Congress understands
the entirety of each bill placed
before him or her. Steele said too
often legislators vote on pieces
of legislation that they fail to
read completely due to excessive
length.
"The bills need to be shorter,"
Steele said. "And they need to be
on one topic, and they need to be
out in the public."
When asked about running
against someone who has been
in Congress for more than five
decades, Steele said he thinks this
actually plays to his advantage
because Dingell has become too

consumed with the Washington
political scene.
"(Dingell's) been in the position
where he thinks every solution
starts and ends in Washington
D.C., and that's just not the case,"
Steele said.
Recently, Steele has become the
subject ofnegative political adver-
tisements from the Dingell cam-
paign. The ads claim that Steele
plans to privatize social security,
provide tax breaks to large corpo-
rations and decrease prescription
drug coverage for senior citizens.
But Steele said these accusations
aren't based in fact.
"My adult life has been taking
care of people who have been on
Social Security or Medicare,"
Steele said. "So this idea that they
want to paint me as someone who
wants to eliminate these things
which I flat out never said is fairly
crazy."
Furman, too, has no political
experience and mirrored much of
Steele's concerns regarding Ding-
ell's politics.
Dingell has been directly
involved with many of the prob-
lems currently plaguing the
nation like the struggling econo-
my, the housing crisis and the fed-
eral debt, Furman wrote.
"All this has taken place on
John Dingell's watch, and when
taking a look at his voting record,
it's easy to see that he's contrib-
uted to these problems," Furman
wrote.
Furman, who's only 25-years
old, wrote that he thinks his
youth will play to his advantage
in the election because it means
he has no connections with large

corporations or special interest
groups.
"I don't have 54 years of ties
to big business and special inter-
ests," Furman wrote. "I don't owe
anyone favors and I'm not owned
by lobbyists."
Furman wrote that he hopes
voters are able to look beyond his
age and instead focus on his polit-
ical platform.
"I believe most voters are smart
enough to base their decision on a
candidate's stances and solutions,
not how many candles are on the
cake," Furman wrote.
Some of Furman's other stanc-
es on policies include advocating
for America to leave its mem-
bership position in the United
Nations, cracking down on illegal
immigration by enforcing stricter
border control, eliminating citi-
zenship by birthright and abolish-
ing foreign aid to countries that
demonstrate hostility, he wrote.
"My role models are the Found-
ing Fathers," Furman added. "My
guide to government and policy
is the Constitution. I'm a fight-
er for liberty, freedom and fis-
cal responsibility. I think that's
one hell of an improvement right
there."
Furman wrote that he hopes
students look beyond the tradi-
tional two-party political system
that has dominated American
politics to date and strongly con-
sider third-party candidates like
himself.
"The future of America hangs
in balance like a loose tooth," Fur-
man wrote. "And it's the Repub-
licans and Democrats that have
brought us to this point."

ICE HOCKEY
Merrill, Langlais
adjust to new roles
as season begins

'M'4toys with position changes
By JOE STAPLETON
Daily SportsEditor

By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Editor
One is a 24 year-old who took a
circuitous route to Ann Arbor. The
other is an 18 year-old who has
been in town the past two years
with the National Team Develop-
ment Program.
One is an undrafted free agent.
The other is a second round pick.
But for the Michigan hockey
team, senior Chad Langlais and
the freshman Jon Merrill, have
made up the top defensive pair in
the first weeks of practice as well
as in the Wolverines' season-open-
ing tie with Mercyhurst. Together,
they're adjustingto their new roles
- Langlais as a senior leader, and
Merrill as a player at the college
level.
"They're both smart," Michi-
gan coach Red Berenson said after
Tuesday's practice. "Merrill's got
an offensive side to him, and he's
got a defensive side to him, so right
now I think he's a good fit with
(Langlais). Now, we'll see when we
get into some serious competition
in our league."
The pair saw a good amount of
time on the power play and both
had an assist on No. 4 Michigan's
first goal of the season. But Mer-
rill's freshman mistakes became
evident as the Lakers mounted
their comeback. His errant pass
up the boards resulted in Mercy-
hurst's third goal. He was the on
the ice for the tying goal as well.
These defensive miscues leave
Merrill like many other freshmen
defensemen - focused on his own
zone far more than the opponent's.
"The hardest thing for a young
defenseman when they come in is
just gettingthe puck out of our own
zone and playing good defense just
so you're not on the ice for minus,
minus, minus," Berenson said. "I
think that's his focus right now is
just making that first pass a good
pass, playing good defense, and

then if he gets any offensive chanc-
es, that's fine."
Merrill finished minus one
against Mercyhurst. But the 38th
pick in last June's NHL Draft can
learn from his free-agent coun-
terpart. Late in overtime, a puck
trickled behind senior goalie
Shawn Hunwick and lay in the
crease. Langlais turned around
and swiped it away with his stick
to preserve the tie.
More important than his defen-
sive heroics is Langlais's newfound
leadership role. After the gradu-
ation of Steve Kampfer and Chris
Summers, Langlais is one of two
seniors on the blue line. And he has
jumped at the opportunity to lead.
"He's had a good role right from
day one," Berenson said. "He's
been a go-to defenseman, but now
you can just see. He's got that extra
swagger, that extra confidence on
the ice, that extra authority on the
ice that goes with experience."
Also absent with Kampfer and
Summers leaving is offense from
the back end. They combined to
account for just over 40 percent of
scoring from defense last year.
Langlais, known for his quick-
ness and puckhandling ability, was
the second-leading scorer among
Michigan defensemen last year
with 21 points, just two behind
Kampfer. But he isn't as eager to
put the added pressure of produc-
ing more points on himself.
"I'm always tough on myself but
I know we have a lot of good defen-
semen that can carry the load too,"
Langlais said.
The members of Michigan's top
defensive pair have their separate
roles iri practice as well. Langlais is
one of the first to get off the ice for
practice, while Merrill has to wait
and pick up all of the pucks. But
all their differences become less
important when the puck drops.
Even the generation gap.
"I didn't even realize he's six
years older than me," Merrill said.

The defensive struggles for the
Michigan football team this year
have been well documented. One
of the most common explanations
for the issues on the defensive
side of the ball is
the unit's lack of NOTEBOOK
experience, espe-
cially in the secondary. So against
Indiana last week in Bloomington,
Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez
decided to spread around what
little experience he had.
Specifically, he spread two of
his most experienced defensive
players around to different areas
of the field.
Junior Mike Martin, who has
started 17 straight games at nose
tackle, found himself playing defen-
sive end at times during Michigan's
42-35 win over the Hoosiers.
And redshirt sophomore J.T.
Floyd, who has started every
game this season at cornerback
along with two games last year,
was moved to safety at certain
points in Saturday's game.
The move worked out well for
Martin, who registered a sack
rushing from the end spot.
"It was fun, it was different,"
Martin said after the game. "It
was something coach (Rodriguez)
put in at the end of the week, so
I didn't get a chance to run it in
practice."
Floyd, arguably the Wolverines'
most consistent cornerback, had a
good afternoon against Indiana,
registering a pass breakup and 15
tackles, with one for loss. Some of
those tackles occurred when he
was playing safety.
"J.T., we put him in some dif-
ferent situations too," redshirt
sophomore Jordan Kovacs said
during Monday's press confer-
ence. "We had a couple different
packages that we ran, I thought
for the most part it worked."
It only worked to an extent,
considering the Michigan (5-0
overall, 1-0 Big Ten) second-
ary was once again torched last
weekend, allowing Hoosier quar-
terback Ben Chappell to have a
record-setting day. The fifth-year
senior completed 45 passes for
480 yards and three touchdowns,

tAKt FROMM/Daily
Sophomore defensive back J.T. Floyd andjunior defensive lineman Mike Martin are two of Michigan's most consistent defend-
ers. And after playing at different positions in Michigan's win over Indiana, the coaches are thinking about keeping the change.

numbers that would make any
defensive coordinator cringe.
Moving Martin and Floyd
around to different positions
could be indicative of a more
desperate search for answers on
defense, which will be tasked next
week with stopping Michigan
State quarterback Kirk Cousins
and sensational freshman run-
ning back Le'Veon Bell.
RODRIGUEZ TALKS ROBIN-
SON'S RECRUITMENT: Sopho-
more quarterback Denard
Robinson has been, without a
doubt, the nation's best player
through the first five games of
the season. But how did he get to
Michigan? Rodriguez shed some
light on his recruitment of Robin-
son during the Big Ten teleconfer-
ence on Tuesday.
According to Rodriguez, one
of the keys to landing Robinson
was promising him that he would
remain a quarterback as opposed
to moving him around the field,

which is what Florida and other
schools aimed to do.
"It was a battle to the end
because Florida and other schools
were recruiting him as an ath-
lete," Rodriguez said. "We told
him quarterback and we were
able to show him that we'd used
similar quarterbacks in the past."
The most noteworthy of those
past quarterbacks was obvi-
ously Pat White, Rodriguez's last
quarterback at West Virginia and
a gifted athlete. Comparisons
between White and Robinson
have abounded since the sopho-
more arrived at Michigan, but
the comparisons have mostly cen-
tered around running ability..
Rodriguez said the comparison
could go beyond that.
"I think the biggest comparison
that I've seen so far is their ability
to lead a team and the attention
they get is not going to faze them
at all," Rodriguez said. "Pat was a
tremendous leader whose team-
mates rallied around him and I

see the same thing with Denard."
DANTONIO TALKS DENARD:
Last week, Michigan State coach
Mark Dantonio was forced to
watch his team's victory over
then-No. 11 Wisconsin from his
hospital bed. His assistants have
said they were in constant contact
with the coach throughout the
game on his cell phone.
On Saturday in the Big House,
they'll only need a headset. Dan-
tonio said during the Big Ten tele-
conference Tuesday that he'll be
coaching from the press box.
The Spartans have a much
different challenge in front of
them this weekend. While they
may have just beaten one of the
best teams in the Big Ten, they
now face Heisman frontrunner
Denard Robinson.
"He is certainly special," Dan-
tonio said of Robinson during the
teleconference on Tuesday. "We
have not come across a player like
him in a long, long time."

SOFTBALL
All three pitchers dominate in exhibition

Freshmen impress
in fall-ball season

Payne, Taylor and
Speierman combine
to give up only one
run in nine innings
By EVERETT COOK
For the Daily
In a theme that promises to be
recurrent throughout the upcom-
ing season, the Michigan softball
team rode
its pitch- LAK ESUPERIOR ST. 1
ingto a 5-1 MICHIGAN 3
exhibition
victory against Eastern Michigan
on Tuesday night at Alumni field.
Junior Hilary Payne, senior Jor-
dan Taylor and sophomore Stepha-
nie Speierman held the Eagles to
one run off of six hits ina game that
was scheduled to go nine innings
instead of the usual seven.
Perhaps the most encourag-
ing part of the game for the Wol-

verines was Payne's bounce back
performance. Payne, a transfer
from Loyola Chicago, was lit up
for six runs last time she took the
hill. Since that was the first out-
ing (albeit in an exhibition) of
her Michigan career, no one was
quite sure what to expect this time
around.
Payne struggled with command
out of the gate, but calmed down
enough to throw three dominant
innings, allowing only one hit and
striking out two. Payne showed her
ability to get outs by forcing many
Eagle popups and seemed to recover
from the butterflies that plagued
her last time.
The other up-and-comer of the
Michigan trio is Speierman, who
continued to impress after throw-
ing three innings of no hit ball in the
last exhibition she played in. Spei-
erman allowed one run on two hits
while striking out four and looked to
have better command of her formi-
dable fastball.
Taylor, the wily veteran of the

group, is looking to build on her
stellar junior season in which she
posted a 1.42 ERA and was named
co-Big Ten player of the year. Taylor
pitched three innings, allowing no
runs and two hits with three strike-
outs.
Last season, Taylor could look
to now-graduated Nikki Nemitz
for help, but these days she is the
eldest of the group and has different
responsibilities.
"Usually as a pitcher you are a
leader before your senior year,"
Taylor said after the game. "But it
is definitely different without Nikki
here. We aren't used to each other
yet, but it looks good and we have
a lot of really good, young players. I
think we will be just fine."
On the offensive end, the Wol-
verines took advantage of a lack of
control from the Eagles' pitchers by
scoring many of the runners who
got on base due to walks. Freshman
Mandy Gardner blasted a two-run
home run after senior Dorian Shaw
was walked, and junior Stepha-

nie Kirkpatrick drove in freshman
Lyndsay Doyle with a single after
Doyle was walked.
Shaw, a first baseman, had a hand
in a lot of the offensive production
by getting on base twice. After lead-
ing the team with 21 home runs last
season, she figures to be a integral
part of the team for the upcoming
year. Shawis one of only six seniors
on this year's team, but she doesn't
see the Wolverines' youth as an
impediment.
"There is no reason we can't
accomplish our goals," Shaw said.
"Our goals are always to win the
College World Series and to win a
Big Ten championship. There's no
reason we can't do that with five
freshmen on the field."
"It's just a matter of not getting
caught up in using the freshman
label as an excuse."
The next exhibition for the Wol-
verines won't be for another four
months, but this game gives them
something to build on during the
winter off-season.

densome, Shaw and the other
seniors are happy to accept the
responsibility Hutchins has put
on them.

of our jobs," Shaw said. "(Coach
Hutchins) shouldn't have to tell
us, it's something we want to do
and it's finally our turn to go, 'Oh,

On the field everything appears
to be in sync. In limited exhibition
play, the squad's freshmen have
shown their potential. On Satur-
day, freshman leftfielder Nicole
Sappingfield collected two base
hits and drove in a run to lead
Michigan to a 7-6 victory.
Tuesday against Eastern Mich-
igan, freshman infielder Mandy
Gardner - who did not play
against the Spartans - gave the
Wolverines a two-run lead with
a home run in the second inning.
Sappingfield added an RBI single
in the fourth as the Wolverines
defeated the Eagles 5-1.
Despite the Wolverines' youth,
the veterans like Shaw are confi-
dent in their team.
"The expectations don't change
when you have more freshmen,"
Shaw said. "We're Michigan soft-
ball and we expect to win the Big
Ten and we expect to go to the
World Series. The expectations
don't change based on who's on
your roster."

A FOREIGN EXPERIENCE

k I

BY NASTASIA PETEUIL

Editor's Note: Nastasia Peteuil is a
student from France who spent the
summer and the first few weeks of the
semester in Ann Arbor. She is not a
native English speaker.
W henI walk in the streets of
Ann Arbor, I think to myself
what a quiet place it is to
live. The city is actually quite large, yet
the nature is omnipresent. I am always
astonished by the sight of all the baby
squirrels in the city, and the forestry of
Nichols Arboretum surrounds one in
calm and serenity despite its setting in
an American city.
But one day, I went to a Saturday
football game.
American football is a real cultural
phenomenon here in the States, espe-
cially at the collegiate level. Each uni-
versity has its team, and just asI'd heard
from American studentsaback in France,
Michigan is particularly obsessed with
its football team. Every Saturday the
pre-game begins before you're out of

bed, then comes the game and then the
post-game for the still able-bodied few.
Every Saturday, game after game.
In my short time in Ann Arbor, I
went to two football games. And what
I found was that Americans love to
play games. The most famous seems
to be beer pong. It's really a game of
skill. You make your opponent drink
by tossing your ping-pong ball into
his or her cup of beer. A special game
for football pre-games is the ice luge
game. This is a special way to drink
fast and freshly. Plenty of other games
exist, some sillier than others. The
wet umbrella, for example: you pour
your beer on the umbrella and a friend
tries to trap the liquid in his mouth.
The dangerous beer thrown in the
air: I never understood the purpose
except thatyou take a cold beer show-
er. The ski: a game of solidarity where
you help your friends to drink as fast
as possible. The crazy reverse wine:
you try once, not twice.

They sure love drinkinggames here
in Ann Arbor.
Another American specialty is
what I will call sidewalk drinker
hunting. This is where the campus
police watch for people drinking on
the sidewalk, lookingto write as many
tickets as possible. This whole open

But I bet most freshman or foreigners
do the same thing I did my first game.
You don't have to know how to go, you
simply follow the others going to the
game like a herd of sheep.
Michigan stadium is the biggest in
the USA. For the first game, the stadi-
um set a new record: 113,090 people!
The colors of the team - maize and
blue - fill the overheated stadium to
capacity. I wondered what the whole
fascination was around these two col-
ors. Everyone in this town seems to
want everything about Michigan and
football to have these colors. I caught
a lot of scorn when I decided to buy
a beautiful plastic fashion bracelet
with the block 'M' - a red 'M'. When
I proudly wore it
ainer law to the first game,
everybody seemed
specially if astonished at me:
"What! It isn't

wasn't blue.

sive, and I think notvery friendly. The
University band actually supports
this with their instruments. Michigan
students apparently love that.
Indeed, it's also interesting to see
how much everyone loves the band
here at Michigan. Everyone loves
the band and thinks it's cool. Back in
France, musicians are seen as arro-
gant or lost souls. The way the college
band operates is different from any-
thing I've ever seen; they even get to
play during the games and at halftime.
The game is also very special. Of
course, there is the part of Ameri-
can football where you're just wait-
ing around all the time for the game
to start, stop, then start again. When
you're watching the game, it's actually
a bit of a game in and of itself to figure
things out. You have to follow the ball.
At moments you're wondering where
the ball is: Who got the ball? Why
did he run and not throw? What is he
doing with the ball? All of these ques-
tions are racing through your head
looking to be answered.
But the, most magical moment of
all is that split second that feels like
an eternity where the quarterback
heaves the ball way up into the air
and time stands still. The stadium
goes silent and everyone follows the
flight of the ball through the air until
that fateful moment when the catch
is made and an explosion of joy rocks
the entire stadium. Or if he misses the
ball, the entire stadium lets loose a
collective sigh. It must be a tough life
for someone after missing a catch to
hear the disappointed sounds directly
at him from 110,000 people.

Once you're
ne, inside the Big House, you have to
n't support your team, and your voice
e- becomes a real weapon. Each song
ge occupies a special niche. For example,
ell. the famous fight song, "The Victors,"
rts dates back to 1898 and serves as the
ac- song I'll remember most. The song is
)id known everywhere as the fight song
ot. of Michigan and everybody knows it
by heart and sings it passionately as a
collective group.
My favorite song is a different one,
though. I'll simply call it "You Suck."
Thelyrics are really easyfor aforeign-
er like me to remember, unlike the
fight song. "You Suck" is more aggres-

TH EJUNKD RAWER
random student interview by will grundler

Hi, this is the Random Stu-
dent Interview, in which
we attempt to gauge the
tragedy of the human condition.
Please state your name and class
standing for the record.
I'm Molly and I'm a sophomore
and I'm majoring in PoliSci.
What do you look for in a part-
ner if they're ugly to begin with?
What sort of values?
I guess just friendliness...a sense of
humor.
Maybe money? You know, for
plastic surgery?
Not really.
Have you ever felt the urge to
slap people who fall asleep in the
library, and if so, why?
No, because they probably need
the sleep.
But isn't it awful when their
mouths just hang open like it's
nobody's business?
I try not to look. I've seen homeless
people sleeping in the library before.
Have you noticed the chalk
messages on sidewalks recently?
Messages like, "You are loved"
and "It's going to get better"? Do
you feel loved and do you think it's
going to get better?
Actually, I write a lot of those for
DORAK (Do Random Acts of Kind-

ness).
Do you think they might make
a person depressed, say, if they're
not actually loved?
No. I think they always put a smile
on people's faces. I don't know if any-
body is not loved.
Well, Hitler. Moving on, it's
thought that if an obnoxiously
large -
Wait, what? There are flames out
there! (Motions to Diag.)
Do you take ADD medication?
I should. I'm just heavily caffein-
ated.
It's thought that if an obnox-
iously large asteroid hadn't wiped
out the dinosaurs sixty-five mil-
lion years ago, we wouldn't exist.
From this perspective, is it pos-
sible for you to take life seriously?
Yeah...uh...yes.
Why don't you think it was men-
tioned in the Bible, though?
(Pensive.) I don't know.
Do you think we should keep
old people around, or just kind of
move them somewhere to free up
space?
Yeah, they teach us a lot. They're
kind of wise, people say.
Do they add anythingto society,
though? Medical costs, I guess.
You're a political science major,

would it be political suicide or per-
haps revolutionary to save costs by
cutting old people?
No, I don't think people would go
for that, no.
Shouldn't the University
increase admissions of left-handed
students if they want to remain
"diverse"?
I guess there should probably be an
equal...an equal...
Equal rights?
Yeah. I'm left-handed, actually.
Right. When you interview for
jobs they probably screen you, you
know, for being left-handed -
Affirmative action.
Well, that's race. But how many
extra points should left-handed
people get in the admissions pro-
cess?
Like, on a scale of one to ten? Five.
Five? Pretty arbitrary. Mov-
ing on, what campus group do
you think we could do away with?
What about the Squirrel Club?
Oh yeah, we can do without that.
They don't do anything of value,
do they? They're like the mosquito
of campus groups.
They don't need to be feeding
squirrels.
There's Glee Club, too.
No, I like glee club. "Glee" is on

tonight.
I don't watch TV.
You've never heard of "Glee"?
I'll ask the questions. Do you
think that big orange statue thing
outside of Angell Hall needs to be
melted down and sold for profit?
Yes. It looks really bad. I've heard
that it's supposed to spell "Art." Is
that true?
Looks like it spells "X" to me. In
ten words or less, tell me how we
can fix the economy.
Uh...
One.
That's a word?
Two, three, four!
Stop wasteful spending.
Why don't we just create more
jobs, though?
Because that's also wasteful
spending, to pay people for jobs that
aren't really necessary.
I guess so. Look for this in
tomorrow's issue of "The State-
ment."
I've read these before. I read the
Daily every day.
Wow, you're our first person
to read the Daily every day! How
awful is it?
I love it.

sity does not have knowledge of this
information," Cunningham wrote in
an e-mail statement.
Since arriving at college Ibarra
has lived somewhat of a double life
because only a few ofher close friends
know she is undocumented.
"I kind of know people are going
to look at me differently if they found
out," she said. "I talk to people about
(the DREAM Act) and they always
.respond with 'if they're undocu-
mented and they're illegal then they
shouldn't be here.' Well, what would
you say if I told you I was undocu-
mented?"
Critics of the DREAM Act call it
an amnesty program and a way for
undocumented parents to use their
children to take advantage of the ben-
efits of living in the U.S. But Nawrocki
doesn't see it that way.
"I can't imagine a two year old
coming into America and thinking
'I'm screwing the system,' " she said.
"It's not amnesty, it's nothing like
that. They have to earn it."
Desire Semana, 19, is an undocu-
mented student and Detroit-area
activist working with the campus
organization By Any Means Neces-
sary. When he is organizing DREAM
Act efforts, Semana says he is con-
stantly dealing with what he calls
"anti-immigrant" bashing.

Act could fix an unfair system.
"The fact that undocumented stu-
dents are not allowed to get financial
aid to go to college is discrimination,
it's second class treatment, it's Jim
Crow," said Rackham student Kate
Stenvig, the president of BAMN.
The protest was one of many that
took place across the country that
day, including protests at Wayne
State University and the University
of California at Berkley. And on Nov.
1, BAMN and other organizations
around the country will again be ral-
lyingin support ofthe DREAM Act on
college campuses across the country.
Though heightened awareness of
the DREAM Act has only recently
made its way to Ann Arbor, a move-
ment has been growing surround-
ing the legislation for months and in
some places across the country, even
years.
In July, students gathered in Wash-
ington, D.C. for what they called
a "mobilization" in support of the
DREAM Act. In addition to rallies
and a mock graduation, eight undocu-
mented students staged a sit-in in the
offices of U.S. Senators Harry Reid
(D-Nevada) and John McCain (R-
Arizona) demanding thatthey support
the DREAM Act as a stand-alone bill.
The eight students are in the pro-
cess of standing trial, but they were
able to have
some influence

With that one interaction, McCain
proved the activists' point. They
aren't getting the same benefits as
other students because they aren't
citizens. And as they see it, without
the DREAM Act they have no viable
path to become citizens.
Martinez said it was this pre-
dicament that drew her to organize
for the DREAM Act. As she sat in a
Washington D.C. coffee shop on a
day off from her summer internship
at the U.S. Department of Education
this summer, Martinez talked about
her undocumented friends from high
school, who are just like her, except
for one detail.
"They couldn't go to college like I
could," she said.
Martinez emigrated to the U.S.
with her family from Mexico legally
when she was younger. Though she
found the transition to a new country
difficult, she was helped along in high
school by a group of friends - some
documented, some not - who also
shared her immigrant experience.
"These students are just like me,
they're just as smart as me or even
smarter, but they're in a state of
limbo," she said.
She added that the worst thing
about not passing the DREAM Act is
that "you're wasting talent."
Robelledo agrees, saying right now
she is essentially prohibited from
contributing to the society that has
provided her with an education up
until this point.
"We want to give back, but we're
not being allowed to because we don't
have a simple number," she said.
"It's really sad to see that because
we grew up like Americans. If I were
to go home, I wouldn't know what
home was," she continued. "We've
been here for so long, we grew up
here. (Citizenship) is the only thing
that is preventing us from continuing
to do what we're doing. Why not let us
do it the right way?"
For Semana, the legislation isn't
just about being able to contribute.
He also thinks it's necessary for him
to get access to the American dream.
"I thought I was in a country where
there were great promises of equali-
ty," he said. "But what I expected was
not forthcoming."

On a blustery afternoon last week,
Semana was on the steps of the Mich-

activists holding signs and trying to
engage passersby. Most students just
walked by without giving a second

started arguing with one of Semana's

ayanna Robelledo, a 20-year-
old second-year student at
Henry Ford Community Col-
lege, has been living in the United
States since she was nine years old.
But because of one day a few years
ago, Robelledo's life is drastically dif-
ferent from that of other American
college students.
Her grandfather, who was an
American citizen, was in the process
of helping the rest of her family apply
for citizenship. Robelledo says her
grandfather was missing one page
of the necessary paper work, so he
decided to drive home from work to
pick it up. On the way back from his
job he got into acar accident and died.
That day changed the trajectory
of Robelledo's life forever. Instead
of being able to consider any college,
like her other high school friends,
Robelledo's choices were limited.
Though some universities would
accept her without a social security
,umber, if they were public she would
likely have to pay an international
student rate, and if they were private
her family wouldn't be able to afford
tuition. And there was no help in
sight - without citizenship, Robelle-

do couldn't apply for financial aid.
Robelledo was able to find a college
that would take her and fit within her
price range, but to pay for it she now
works 12-hour shifts at a factory dur-
ing the semester.
And it's unclear if all that work will
even pay off in the end because it will
be nearly impossible for Robelledo
to pursue her dream of becoming a
teacher without a viable path toward
citizenship.
Robelledo and other students like
her are working to get Congress to
pass one piece of legislation that
they hope will take their aspirations
off hold. The bill - the Develop-
ment, Relief and Education for Alien
Minors Act - was shot down last
month when it was before the U.S.
Senate as part of a larger defense bill.
But if passed, the DREAM Act would
allow undocumented individuals to
earn citizenship through two years
of college, or two years of military
service.
For Robelledo, getting the legisla-
tion passed amounts to a question of
her livelihood.
"If the DREAM Act were to pass,
(undocumented students) would

become non-deportable so I wouldn't
have that fear of maybe getting
deported tomorrow," Robelledo said.
Students around the country and
across southeast Michigan are work-
ing through rallies, callingcampaigns
and even public arrests to push Con-
gress to act, and despite the recent set
back, they say they're not giving up.
"We're a little disappointed
that the vote wasn't moved upon,"
said Education senior Samantha
Nawrocki. "We definitely didn't see it
as a defeat for the DREAM Act. We're
re-strategizing on how we're going to
keep pressuring Congress. Since we
have a little bit more time we're going
to continue to try to grow the base."
Nawrocki is an organizer with One
Michigan - a group with chapters
around the state that is advocating
for the DREAM Act. Nawrocki, who
has a passion for immigrants' rights
issues, said she first became involved
with the DREAM Act after meeting
undocumented students at a sort of
DREAM Act activism boot camp.
"These people really became my
friends and seeing what the DREAM
Act would mean to them and their
futures was how I became invested

in the DREAM Act," she said. "With
a lot of these students, they're going
through college right now, but what
does that really mean in the end?"
This is a question that Maria Ibar-
ra asks herself all the time. Ibarra, 20,
is a junior at the University of Detroit
Mercy studying English and social
work, but because she is an undocu-
mented citizen, her degrees will
amount to little once she graduates.
"If the DREAM Act doesn't pass, I
won't be able to get my (social work)
license," she said.
But there are other challenges that
Ibarra faces on a day-to-day basis.
She works full time while attending
school, so when her friends are out
having fun, she is always busy catch-
ing up onhomework.
Living off-campus also creates
daily obstacles.
"How am I going to get to school
today? Am I going to risk it and drive
without a license?" is a question Ibar-
ra says she constantly grapples with.
And the reason Ibarra spends
her limited free time attending One
Michigan meetings and calling con-
gressmen is because she believes the
DREAM Act will be her ticket to a

typical college life.
"It would just take away this con-
stant, not really fear, I don't know,
frustration, at the back of your mind
that you can't do what everyone else
takes for granted," she said.
"Itwould meanI can stop worrying
about little things," Ibarra continued.
"When I turn 21 t won't be able to go
out with my friends and celebrate and
go have a drink because I won't have
an ID to prove that I'm 21."
Ibarra's college application process
was also drastically different from
that of her friends. She had always
dreamed of attending the University
of Michigan, and she even went as far
as to complete the entire application.
But she "just tore it apart" because
she was concerned her status would
make it impossible for her to attend.
According to University spokes-
woman Kelly Cunniningham,
undocumented students aren't pre-
cluded from attending the Univer-
sity because University officials are
unaware of their status during the
admissions process.
"Proof of citizenship is not
required during the admissions
process and therefore the Univer-

W ith the beginning of October comes changing leaves, cooler and crisper weather and
a plethora of potential inexpensive outdoor activities to do. The Michigan autumn will
undoubtedly quickly turn to winter, but before it does, take advantage of some fall activities that
won't break your budget.
One of the best things about going to college in Michigan is the easy availability of cider mills.
So, plan a day with some friends picking apples and drinking warm mulled cider before the or-
chards freeze over. There are tons of cider mills close by, but if you want to pick your own apples,
try going to Wiard's Orchards and County Fair in Ypsilanti. But if you don't have an interest in the
fair, avoid going during the weekend when there is a (somewhat hefty) county fair admission fee.
If you don't want to spend the effort and money getting to an apple orchard, take advantage of
the fall activities you can do right here on campus. Take a scenic walk through the Arboretum. Play
a game of frisbee by the Diag. Jump in a pile of freshly raked leaves. Or, just breathe in the fresh,
free autumn air.

How Joseph Rosa plans to usher UMMA into the 21st century

By Leah Burgin

PhotosbyJedMoch

I

Imagine the second floor of the Univer-
sity of Michigan Museum of Art. No matter
which doors you enter through - the Alumni
Memorial Hall doors, accessed through a clas-
sical colonnade, or the modern entries of the
Maxine and Stuart Frankel and the Frankel
Family Wing - and no matter which path you
followthrough the museum, atsome point you
find yourself on a threshold. You look through
the glass out toward State Street
and realize you're on a bridge
between the old and the new.
This transition is not sub-
tie. Structurally, there's a
marked change in materi-
als as the marble flooring
turns to wood. The collec-
tions change as well - from
exhibits featuring Europe-
an and American art to those
with Asian and African works.
It can be described as a change in
atmosphere. The old wing emotes
rigidity and respect; the new oozes light
and energy.
A man named Joseph Rosa stands on a simi-
lar threshold. As the new director of UMMA,
Rosa is charged with a unique responsibil-
ity: bridging the gap between the museum's
150-year-old collection and its brand new
expansion, intended to usher UMMA into the
21st century. And with over 18,000 pieces in
UMMA's collection and 53,000 square feet in
the new Frankel Wing, there are a lot of pos-
sible forms this bridge could take. But Rosa is
up for the challenge.
Rosa, soft spoken but energetic,
describes his entry into the museum world
as serendipitous. After receiving architec-
ture degrees from both the Pratt Institute in
Brooklyn and Columbia University, he worked
for various architectural firms. Through that
work, Rosa became interested in the work of
Albert Frey, about whom he ultimately wrote
a book and put together and curated a show.
Rosa says he didn't plan to get into a career
with museums, but since that first show, he
has been hooked. His body of work speaks for
itself. Rosa has curated more than 30 exhib-
its at the four museums he's worked at: the
National Building Museum in Washington,
D.C., the Heinz Architectural Center at the
Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburg, the San
Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Art
Institute of Chicago.
Ruth Berson, the deputy director of exhi-
bitions and collections at the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art said Rosa was an
"absolutely fabulous curator" when she
worked with him during his time as the muse-
um's Helen Hilton Raiser Curator of Architec-
ture and Design.

She remembered, in particular, a series
of exhibitions Rosa put together called "The
Design Series" that looked at "cutting-edge
work in architecture and design."
"(The series) provided a forum for the ...
emerging people in the field," Berson said. "He
has an eye for what is coming up and is new."
Chrysanthe Broikos, a curator at the
National Building Museum, echoes Berson's
sentiments on how Rosa nurtured and led his
department in Washington.
"He brought a lot of great shows to the
museum and really tried to raise the profile
of the (National Building Museum)," Broikos
said. "He would actually design a lot of the
smaller shows we were doing ... and that
helped in terms of the overall look and feel of
the exhibition."
But no museum tested Rosa more than the
Art Institute of Chicago. In his position as the
museum's John H. Bryan Chair and Curator
of Architecture and Design, Rosa was chal-
lenged with retooling his department as well
as with overseeing a 300,000-square-foot
expansion project.
Rosa was brought to Chicago to be, as he
says, an "alchemist," exponentially expanding
the museum's previously small collection in a
short time span.
Zoe Ryan, the Art Institute's Neville Bryan
Curator of Design and interim John H. Bryan
Chair and Curator ofArchitecture and Design,
was actively involved with Rosa's departmen-
tal changes.
Currently, Ryan and Rosa are co-curating
an exhibit set to open at the Art Institute Dec.
11. It's Rosa's final exhibit at the Art Institute
and is the result of Rosa's and Ryan's close col-
laboration for the past four years. The show,
"Hyperlinks: Architecture and Design,"
focuses on the idea that architects and design-
ers can work with a base idea that has mul-
tiple iterations. The exhibit demonstrates that
the germination of an idea can be universally
applied.
"Someone doesn't just make a chair," Rosa
explained, gesticulating wilding. "It's a chair
with other possibilities."
"The hyperlinks show is thinking very
broadly of what architecture and design
mean," Ryan added. "We want to have unique
and original works in the museum."
According to Ryan, this somewhat-radical
exhibit reflects Rosa's management style and
what he can bring to UMMA - taking further
the department, which brags the largest gal-
leries devoted to art and design in the country.
"We are very forward-thinking," she said.
"(Rosa is) not afraid of avant-garde methods
and approaches."
After James Steward - UMMA's
sixth director who held the post for 11 years
and oversaw the expansion project - left the

"We need to start acting like a
regional art museum because
we're as big as one."

questioning what a museum can be," he said.
"A university by nature challenges students to
be the best and gives them the edge on what-
ever medium it is that they're studying."
"(I thought) 'What could I do if I was there?
How could I make it even more than it is? Can
I contribute? Can I do what they need?' "he
added. "Those are the parts I loved the most
(about UMMA): feeling comfortable and just
being energized by what the possibilities are."
In coming to UMMA, Rosa brought with
him big ideas for the museum. Integral to the
implementation of his goals is utilizing the
new Frankel wing. Opened in March of 2009,
this wing represented a $41.9 million, 3-year
expansion and refurbishing project.
For Silverman and Slavin, the expansion
was nothing but positive.
"I think the University of Michigan now
has the art museum it deserves," Slavin said.
"We're very poised to fulfill the educational
and University mission because of the addi-
tion. Everything from classes taking place on
a daily basis to lectures and symposiums. We
can showcase performing arts on a faculty
and student level. So to me, the building is the
physical opportunity to manifest the mission."
Rosa is very interested in the "town/gown"
debate, and many of the initiatives he plans
to pursue speak to both of UMMA's main
constituent groups - the University and the
surrounding community - and aim toward
bridging the gap between these two circles.
Rosa said he is looking toward creating
"three tiers" of improving the museum. The
first: collaboration with other units, like the
School of Social Work and the Ross School
of Business, that might not have a museum to
house their collections. Secondly, Rosa plans
to hire a curatorial administrator "to manage
guest curators and traveling shows" in order
to give the museum's current three curators
more time to produce their own shows. And
last, Rosa wants to fill any gaps within the col-
lection by bringing in guest curators or travel-
ing shows.
Rosa said that he also wants to "start using
the museum in new ways" and is considering
how UMMA can reach out to the student pop-
ulation and the Ann Arbor community.
"I want the building to become a nexus for
students and people in Michigan," he said.
"We're going to explore the possibility of hav-
ing the building open twice a year ... from 6
p.m. to 12 a.m. with music and food because
it should be a place where people come to mix.
Another thing is possibly doing projections in
the courtyard ... from night to morning. (By)
showing videos at night, even while the build-
ing is closed, the building is active."
Accordingto Rosa, just as important as col-
laboration between UMMA and other Uni-

versity departments is a relationship between
UMMA and the greater academic community
from outside of the University. He is also inter-
ested in establishing a solid future plan for the
museum.
"My interest now is to be macro and then
micro. We need to start acting like a regional
art museum because we're as big as one," he
said. "We need to start thinking about holding
events here ... Many people are interested in a
black tie gala, a lecture series, an acquisition
meeting."
He added that UMMA will use the services
of a consultant to help the museum with its
"master plan."
"One ear, three years, five years, and then
you revise before the fifth year for another five
years. It allows everyone's voice tobe heard ...
It's collective," he said. "In five years, where.
do we want to be? ... It's the moment to ques-
tion. It'll be fun."
Rosa also has more pedestrian goals for
UMMA in the coming years, including ana-
lyzing branding, membership and how to
bring more visitors to the museum.
"We want to bring in more people for the
experience," Rosa explained. "It's not just foot
traffic, it's web traffic, when you curate a show
and it travels, that's your traffic.... I'd love to
see our shop go online. We could have more
merchandise. Things like that."
So far, Rosa has found his time at UMMA
"productive," saying that "everything is going
smoothly."
"The previous director did an amazing job
building this building," he said. "And the
previous directors did an amazing job
building a collection. (UMMA is) one
of the oldest and largest of the uni-
versity museums, with a col-
lection that's quite good.
That's a great platform
to build and play
with."
"University
museums
are not
just little
leagues,"
he added.
"They
actually cul-
tivate things that are
going to the big places."
For now, it seems that UMMA needs to
successfully straddle the bridge between its
past and its present, ushering in a new age of
community interaction, while simultaneously
creating a bridge for all of its constituents. But
for Rosa, a director who understands bridges
from a structural and theoretical standpoint,
these goals are not out of reach.
"Everyone goes to the gym," he said.
"Everyone should belong to museums."

University in 2009 to accept the directorship
of the Princeton University Art Museum,
the University formed a 14-person advisory
search committee to find his replacement.
"In general, we had a large pool of appli-
cants," said committee member Raymond
Silverman, director of the museum studies
program. "Some people applied from aca-
demic museums ... others applying from civic
museums. Most of the applicants were people
who had held high level curatorial positions,
such as Joe Rosa."
Rosa understood UMMA's desire for a map-
savvy driver.
"They were interested in someone who
could help lead, direct, be collaborative and be
the face for the institution," he said. "I've done
that and I love doing that. It's a complicated
little business if you don't know the ropes."
Besides being impressed with "how nice
everyone was" during the laborious interview
process and the University's dedication to the
arts, Rosa was attracted to UMMA because,
as he said, "there's nothing broken" within the
institution.
"I was amazed," he said. "In the contempo-

rary state of art culture and museums as insti-
tutes, there's a lot broken. I thought, 'There
are no potholes anywhere!' and there usually
is. And I was impressed to see this uncondi-
tional commitment to art from the provost
and the president, which I think is, quite hon-
estly, a rarity."
He was also impressed by the excitement
and enthusiasm of the University's alumni
community.
"When I said I was coming here, all the sud-
den allthese people (I know) are from the Uni-
versity of Michigan," Rosa said. "(They have)
unconditional love for the University, which
is brilliant, because this place gave people
a start to a life that they treasure, and that's
what education should be about. That's what
art should be about."
Rosa also felt at home at the University.
As a member of both worlds UMMA encom-
passes - academia and museums - Rosa said
UMMA "felt natural." He was also excited by
the opportunities that UMMA presents as a
university museum.
"University art museums are really the
most accessible place to do things that are
