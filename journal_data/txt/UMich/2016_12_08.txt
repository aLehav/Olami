The School of Art & Design 

has 
begun 
to 
implement 

strategies to increase diversity 
in teaching and in coursework 
as part of the University of 
Michigan’s 
campus-wide 

plans to increase diversity, 
equity and inclusion.

Karina Moore, director of 

admissions at the Art & Design 
School, said as part of the DEI 
initiative, grants have been 
given to different areas of the 
University to allow them to 
increase inclusion specifically 
within their space, which the 
school has received. The exact 
monetary amount of the grants 
has not been released.

The 
Stamps 
Diversity, 

Equity & Inclusion Strategic 
Planning 
Committee 

submitted its specific plan to 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel before he released 
his campus-wide plan. The 
original Art & Design School 
plan included concepts for 
better recruiting and retaining 
diverse faculty.

Moore said after receiving 

feedback 
and 
financial 

commitments 
from 
the 

University, the Art & Design 
School decided to use the 
funding to focus on the aspects 
of their plan tied to curriculum 
and faculty teaching.

Irina 
Aristarkhova, 

professor of Art & Design and 
head of the DEI commitee 

for the Art & Design school, 
wrote 
after 
meeting 
with 

students to receive input on 
ways to improve the plan, the 
school has started running 
workshops with the Center 
for Research on Learning 
and Teaching in response to 
desires for a more diversity-
oriented curriculum.

“Our next workshop is this 

coming 
Friday, 
December 

9, where faculty will share 
their syllabi and workshop 
new ideas for assignments, 
examples, and strategies to 
make inclusive teaching a more 
explicit part of their courses 
for Winter 2017 semester,” she 
wrote.

Art & Design Prof. Franc 

Nunoo-Quarcoo, former head 
and current member of the 
planning 
committee, 
noted 

the Art & Design School had 
not received all the funding 
it requested, but said the 
committee 
will 
focus 
on 

achieving its goals in other 

With the fall semester 

coming to a close, Central 
Student 
Government 
has 

set 
the 
groundwork 
for 

campaign 
initiatives 
it 

hopes to carry out next 
year, 
including 
engaging 

more with the student body 
through scholarships and an 
anti-racism campaign called 
“It Starts with Me.”

In late September, CSG 

released a diversity report 
that indicated the Student 
Assembly 
was 
mostly 

made up of wealthy, white, 
heterosexual males. White 
students 
made 
up 
69.8 

percent 
of 
the 
assembly 

while Asian students made 
up 
the 
second 
largest 

portion of members with 
9.3 percent. The diversity 
report noted 58.1 percent of 
members identified as male, 
40.7 percent as female and 
1.2 percent preferred not to 
answer. A 2015 analysis by 
The Michigan Daily noted 
the past seven CSG presidents 
had been men.

CSG 
President 
David 

Schafer, an LSA senior, said 
after the survey’s release that 
the student government was 
committed to diversity both 
on campus and within the 
organization.

Whip’s Dog Days has been a

of Michigan for almost 25 years,

Whip’s Dog Days will celebrate 
its 25th anniversary on campus.

“He had people who had

Whipple said. “He was here for 12 
years. And he said he had a pretty

CLAIRE MEINGAST/Daily

Theatre Prof. Anita Gonzalez and Dance Prof. Robin Wilson hold a discussion about diversity in the arts for the Diversity Next! series at North Quad Wednesday 
night.

An 
opera 
professor, 
an 

investigative choreographer, an 
Ann Arbor resident, a graduate 
student and about seven other 
arts-interested 
individuals 

all convened Wednesday in 

a community room in North 
Quad to discuss the importance 
of 
including 
arts 
in 
the 

diversity conversation as part 
of the Diversity Next! series 
organized by the Center for 
World Performance Studies.

The event was the first of the 

series, which, according to the 
event’s flyer “is an arts-inspired 

series of conversations… that 
seeks to broaden the horizons 
of diversity deliberations on 
the U-M campus and beyond.” 
The CWPS said they aim to 
host three more panels during 
the winter semester.

Diversity Next! is separate 

from 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan’s Diversity, Equity 

& 
Inclusion 
plan 
launched 

by 
University 
President 

Mark 
Schlissel 
in 
October 

and includes campus climate 
related 
training 
and 
the 

opening of the new Trotter 
Multicultural Center to create 
a more diverse and inclusive 
campus.

Earlier 
this 
month, 

the 
Michigan 
House 
of 

Representatives 
introduced 

a bill to adjust the Michigan 
National Guard State Tuition 
Assistance 
Program. 
The 

bill, which was introduced by 
Rep. Bruce Rendon (R–Lake 
City) would allow any current 
member of the National Guard 
to apply for tuition assistance 
while attending a university or 
college in Michigan. 

The 
Michigan 
National 

Guard 
assistance 
program 

is housed within the state’s 
Department of Military and 
Veteran Affairs. Brig. Gen. 
Mike Stone, assistant adjutant 
general for installations of 
the Michigan Army National 
Guard, said the revamping 
of the program is a welcome 
change that will strengthen 
Michigan’s National Guard.

“The program is all about 

readiness,” 
he 
said. 
“Our 

number one priority in the

is 
readiness.

Is Virtual 
Reality the 

New Reality?


Tuesday, the University of 

Michigan Health System was 

ranked among the top teaching 

hospitals in the country by the 

Leapfrog Group — a nonprofit 

group that reports on the quality of 

health care provided by hospitals 

nationwide.

The rankings, recognized to 29 

hospitals across 13 states, take into 

account factors such as the quality 

of intensive care, positive poll 

responses about patient care from 

former patients and a high safety 

rating. 

Only one other hospital in 

Michigan, Metro Health Hospital 

in Grand Rapids, was recognized as 

one of the top teaching hospitals in 

the country.

Last August, UMHS was 

ranked number one in the state 

and 18th in the country, by another 

ranking system, U.S. News & World 

Report.

This past October, the Leapfrog 

Group also awarded the UMHS an 

A ranking for safety — a distinction 

that takes into consideration 

factors like hand hygiene and 

communication about medicines 

and discharge information.

According to the UMHS 

website, the hospital system 

processes thousands of patients 

each year.

“Our three hospitals, 40 

outpatient locations with more than 

150 clinics, and extensive home 

care operations handle 2.1 million 

outpatient visits, more than 47,000 

hospital stays in 1,000 beds, and 

much more each year,” the website 

states.

UMHS declined to comment 

about Tuesday’s rankings.

Before and after Yirong 

“Rose” Bi arrived to the 
United States from Hangzhou, 
China — with little to no 
experience speaking English 
— she has overcome many 
difficulties.

First was a surgery in 2014 

that took her out of the pool for 
four months. More recently 
was a 10-page English paper 
due right before the Big Ten 
Championships. She believes 
that these experiences have 
helped her develop faith in 
herself.

Determination, it seems, 

runs through her veins. Bi 
recalled the story of her 
father, who was born into a 
large family that was very 
poor. He was able to secure 
a good education due to his 
hard work and ultimately 

started his own business. 
Around the time Bi was 5, her 
father’s company fell apart, 
but he was persistent in his 
work to improve the situation. 
Now, his company is a sponsor 
for next year’s World Cup.

“He’s 
a 
really 
strong 

man,” Bi said. “I want to be 
strong like him, to be able to 
overcome anything and be a 
strong woman.”

Since then, she’s conquered 

those obstacles and more. In 
her first two years on the No. 6 
Michigan women’s swimming 
and diving team, Bi has made 
quite the impression.

Winning two NCAA All-

American honors in the 500-
yard freestyle and 1,650-yard 
freestyle her freshman year, 
and boasting a GPA over 3.7, 
she was awarded the College 
Swim 
Coaches 
Association 

of 
America 
Scholar 
All-

American. So far this season 

she has been named Big Ten 
Swimmer of the Week and has 
competed in the USA College 
Challenge — a meet pitting 
college 
athletes 
against 

professionals.

Even more impressive than 

that is when Bi arrived from 
Hangzhou, China, she spoke 
very little English. 

Bi took her first steps on 

American soil walking into her 
freshman year at Michigan. 
She faced a steep adjustment 
to a new culture, language 
and 
classroom 
setting, 

having been homeschooled 
all throughout high school so 
she could attend a swimming 
academy. 
This 
transition 

has been difficult, but Bi 
was ready for a change and 
undeterred by the challenge.

“I knew it was going to be 

hard, but I didn’t expect it 
to be that hard,” Bi said. “I 
knew that Michigan has a 

really good swim team, 
and I wanted to improve 
my swimming. I wanted 
to learn something real … 
and I was really excited 
to be in class, to have 
classmates around you and 
have that atmosphere.” 

Working with a tutor 

and 
speaking 
English 

every day are the two key 
aspects 
she 
attributes 

to 
her 
improvement. 

However, 
the 
language 

barrier is one Bi is still 
working to overcome.

“Communication 
has 

been a major challenge,” 
Bi 
said. 
“Sometimes 
I 

don’t know how to express 
myself to others, especially 
with classes. In class, I’m 
too shy to ask questions, 
but I go to office hours as 
much as I can. So, private 
situations make me feel 
comfortable to talk about 
what I’m struggling with.” 

Bi also benefits from her 

relationship with her new 
teammates, who have been

BRIEF: UMHS HIGHLY-RANKED AMONG TEACHING HOSPITALS

Laura De Becker, associate curator of African Art at the University of Michigan Museum of Art, presents about 
her most recent exhibition on Wednesday evening at UMMA.

the grill and serves a lunchtime 
crowd. Whipple said he is not in 
it to get rich, but rather to pay for 
his son’s education and to make 
relationships with his customers.

“I do it for the students,” 

Whipple said. “Students come a 
lot during their time here and then 
graduate. My favorite part about 
being out here is just working with 
the community and being a part of 
it. After being out here this long, 
you become part of Ann Arbor.”

His commitment, he said, stems 

from his desire to be there for the 
students since many expect him to 
be there every day for them. The 
only things that stop Whip’s Dog 
Days are snow, heavy wind and 
rain or sub-zero temperatures.

“It’s the relationships that you 

build out here, there’s a lot of 
good people out on the streets,” 
Whipple said. “As long as you give 
them good service and good food, 
everything works out. I would 
credit it to being persistent and 
being reliable. People know you’re 
here.”

Whipple said he has gotten to 

know several students throughout 
the years, many of whom often 
come back to visit after they 

graduate.

“The nice thing is that I get to 

know them because they become 
regulars,” Whipple said. “Then 
once they graduate, I’ve had a lot 
of them, over the years, come back 
and just visit me. Then we catch 
up. They see how I’m doing, I see 
how they’re doing.”

He credits his success largely 

to the convenience and the prices 
of his products. Despite many 
competitors over the years who 
told Whipple they were going to 
shut him down, Whip’s Dog Days 
has remained, albeit with some 
changes.

“I created the dog of the day 

and I made my own homemade 
mustard,” Whipple said. “And 
I just got more creative to offer 
more things. We’ve had the same 
menu. But sometimes I bring out 
different soups and I added bagels 
and cream cheese.”

Engineering sophomore John 

Cohen said he visits Whipple’s 
stand frequently on Monday’s and 
Wednesday’s since he has classes 
from 9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. and can get 
food quickly.

“This is somewhere pretty close 

and cheap and just makes hot 
food,” Cohen said. “It’s convenient 
because I’m going up to north right 
now and it’s right by the bus stop. 
Everything kind of clicks.”

Other characteristics Whipple 

said have helped him outlast 
competitors 
are 
his 
friendly 

service, a central location, low 
prices and a high-quality product.

“The convenience of it, being 

where it’s located is big,” Whipple 
said. “They’re in a hurry. They 
have to get to class. I keep my 
prices low to where it’s affordable. 
It’s a good quality product. There 
are people who come and go, but 
the thing is, is they don’t run it like 
a business. Students come to me 
and tell me they care. I think that’s 
the success over the years: being 
here for people.”

Since he runs his stand on a 

college campus, Whipple said he 
likes to keep his prices low. He still 
only accepts cash, as he prefers that 
over using credits cards, saying he 
would have to push his prices up to 
pay for new technology.

“Students don’t have a lot of 

money,” Whipple said. “I like to 
keep my prices low so I can keep a 
high volume of customers.”

When Whipple packs up at 3 

p.m. and drives his trailer back to 
the garage where he cleans up for 
the day, he said he is satisfied he 
was able to be on campus making 
an impact on the lives of others.

“It’s the people,” Whipple said. 

“It’s about being out with the 
people. It makes for a good day.”

ways. 

For instance, Moore said, 

part of the plan requested a 
DEI 
coordinator 
specifically 

for the Art & Design School, but 
that request was not granted. 
Instead, the committee itself 
will make up for the lost role and 
all members of the community 
will be responsible for holding 
the school accountable.

Moore 
said 
prospective 

students this year have shown 
an increased interest in learning 
about campus climate issues 
both in the Art & Design School 
and around the University.

“Prospective 
students, 

especially 
this 
year 
with 

everything that has been going 
on across the country, are more 
willing or interested in asking 
about what the climate is, 
having to do with all kinds of 
diversity here at Stamps and at 
large at the University,” Moore 
said.

Nunoo-Quarcoo said at the 

end of this year the committee 
will create a one-year report 
to 
assess 
the 
plan 
before 

creating 
another 
report 
at 

the five-year mark. He noted 
while these reports will be an 
overall 
description 
of 
what 

the committee has done, what 
has been observed, what has 
been learned and what needs 
improvement, the committee 
will always look at how the 
plan is going through regular 
meetings.

He said he hopes at the end 

of five years, DEI becomes less 

of something each unit has to 
do, but something that happens 
naturally.

“DEI should become a main 

issue, it should become the 
default,” Nunoo-Quarcoo said. 
“For me, it really ought to be the 
default and not the exception.”

Aristarkhova 
wrote 
that 

having a wider perspective is 
necessary in the art and design 
world today, whether that be 
for one’s own creative practice, 
career 
opportunities 
or 

problems within communities 
that need solving.

“Due 
to 
the 
increasingly 

global nature of art and design, 
the school needs a diverse group 
of faculty and staff to prepare a 
diverse community of students 
to contribute their full potential 
to a much more globalized world 
of art and design,” she wrote.

Moore said the DEI plans 

at the Art & Design School are 
important not only because 
they 
will 
improve 
climate 

issues within the school, but 
also because they will help the 
students grow as artists.

“On a broader level, artists 

and designers are instigators in 
our society — they are raising 
awareness, they are bringing 
up issues that are important 
to everyone in society,” Moore 
said. “So they themselves, they 
need to be aware and have 
spaces where there are guided 
discussions and conversations 
about these issues and where 
they’re not only able to but 
required to investigate what’s 
happening in terms of diversity, 
equity and inclusion not only 
here at U of M but in our country 
through their creative work.”

disaster? The program helps 
with retention of our members 
and strength in our readiness. 
It’s a benefit to our members 
so they can continue their 
education.”

HB 6013 stems from a 

previous 
National 
Guard 

tuition assistance program, 
which went into effect in 
July 2014 and was the first 
of its kind in the state. The 
program create a National 
Guard tuition assistance fund 
was created within the state 
treasury, 
giving 
the 
state 

treasurer the ability to direct 
the investments for the fund. 
The fund is capped at $10 
million.

Michigan was one of the 

last states in the country to 
adopt a tuition assistance 
program for soldiers in the 
National Guard. The state 
had a program prior to the 
2008 Great Recession, but 
discontinued it due to the 
limited state budget.

The current program has 

faced many challenges in 
terms of the administration 
of the program according to 

Stone. He said the original 
program 
required 
going 

through 
many 
steps 
and 

people in order to approve 
tuition assistance and get 
those funds to the universities 
or colleges.

“That first year was chaotic 

because we couldn’t launch 
our marketing campaign, so 
the first incoming class of 
young soldiers didn’t know 
where to go and didn’t have a 
website,” he said. “They were 
manually processing all of 
these tuition requests. After 
December that year we had 
so much paper stacked up … 
we didn’t get our payments 
out the door to our soldiers 
in time for them to register 
for second semester. It was an 
administrative nightmare.”

To addresss this, the bill 

gives the adjutant general 
the power to expend money 
from the fund to an eligible 
candidate 
at 
an 
eligible 

educational institution. This 
determining power would be 
given to Maj. Gen. Gregory 
Vadnais, 
adjutant 
general 

and director of military and 
veterans affairs for Michigan’s 
National Guard.

The 
tuition 
assistance 

can cover any field of study 

that will lead to vocational 
or 
technical 
training, 
a 

certificate 
or 
the 
eligible 

person’s 
first 
associate’s, 

bachelor’s or master’s degree.

Stone 
said, 
despite 
the 

administrative 
hiccups 

associated 
with 
the 
first 

bill, the National Guard has 
already seen an increase in 
registration and rankings of 
Michigan’s Guard.

“We have seen an increase 

in enrolled soldiers after the 
creation of the program,” he 
said. “Of the 54 states and 
districts that participate, we 
were lagging in the 40s and 
50s in a number of categories. 
This past fiscal year we ended 
in the top 10 for many of these 
categories.”

He added that he believed 

the program will continue to 
help strengthen Michigan’s 
National Guard.

“We are number one in 

the nation in recruitment per 
capita,” he said. “The program 
is having a positive effect on 
our readiness. When a state 
can maintain its unit strength, 
you keep those units. Prior to 
the creation of the program, 
we’ve been losing forces to 
Ohio and Indiana as direct 
competitors for talent.”

Ed 
Sarath, 
interim 

director 
of 
Center 
for 

World Performance Studies 
and professor of jazz and 
contemporary improvisation, 
spearheaded 
the 
Diversity 

Next! initiative.

“The idea of the series 

is to convene a series of 
conversations 
on 
diversity 

that are inspired by the arts 
and that seek to put attention 
on areas of the diversity 
conversation 
that 
don’t 

necessarily get addressed that 
often, if at all,” Sarath said.

He pointed to Black music 

as an example of the lack of 
interconnectedness between 
race and diversity.

“So for instance, the place 

of Black music in the music 
curriculum and in the culture 
of 
Black 
studies 
is 
very 

marginalized, so that’s an 
example of a topic that will 
come up,” he said.

Sarath, Theatre & Drama 

Prof. Anita Gonzalez and 
Dance Associate Prof. Robin 
Wilson 
were 
the 
three 

panelists at this particular 
discussion.

The conversation, which 

was not attended by any 
students, was largely open-
ended. To begin the event, the 
panelists talked about their 
experiences 
with 
art 
and 

diversity.

Gonzalez said the arts have 

been diverse for a long time 
but now it’s important to 
connect that to the University 
as a whole.

“(I) always found the arts 

to be diverse,” she said to the 
group. “The conversation is 
how diversity can work into 
the University.”

Wilson 
echoed 
that 

sentiment, saying the arts 
inherently have a role to play 

in creating a more diverse 
environment for everyone.

“One of the ways to look at 

this is not only how the arts 
have always been diverse, but 
how at their best they have 

erased boundaries,” she said. 

As 
the 
conversation 

progressed, 
the 
event’s 

attendees asked the panelists 
questions, 
including 
on 

initiatives that panelists have 
been involved in during their 
careers and their motivations 
for doing and creating art. 

Conflict arose between the 

panelists when they began 
discussing differences in their 
art forms and experiences. 
Sarath 
talked 
about 
how 

in his experience as a jazz 
musician, he has occasionally 
felt like the minority when 

he was in environments with 
other types of musicians. 
One audience member said 
they felt attacked by Sarath’s 
statement, as she believed 
he was generalizing other 
types of musicians, but the 
disagreement 
was 
short-

lived, 
as 
they 
realized 

that it was an instance of 
miscommunication.

As the conversation came 

to an end, the members of the 
group said they were pleased 
with how it went and they are 
looking forward to the panels 
continuing next semester.

One 
audience 
member, 

Rackham 
student 
Jennifer 

Pollard, said it spurred some 
unique 
conversations 
and 

thoughts. 
She 
added 
that 

moving forward, it will be 
important to continue talking 
about 
diversity 
and 
how 

different forums and groups 
of people can address a lack 
of it.

“I 
guess 
(the 
aim 
is) 

pretty much now to kind of 
streamline and figure out 
how we bring people together, 
how we find them, because 
sometimes there are people 
that have been missing from 
conversations” Pollard said. 

ensuring that as a governing 
body, we are representative 
of every student on campus,” 
Schafer said at the time. “We 
look 
forward 
to 
analyzing 

the results of the report and 
conceptualizing ways in which 
we can better represent our 
various constituencies.”

CSG has since sought to 

increase 
socioeconomic 

diversity within the body and 
beyond through the Leadership 
Engagement 
Scholarship, 

which 
provides 
monetary 

support to student leaders. 
The scholarship is meant to 
ease the financial burden of 
participating in organizations 
such as member fees and 
hours worked at organization 
events. So far, CSG has raised 
$100,000 through fundraising 
and donations.

CSG Vice President Micah 

Griggs, an LSA senior, said 
the scholarship helps alleviate 
the financial strain of being 
heavily involved in a student 
group.

“There 
is 
socioeconomic 

status within diversity and that 
can be a barrier for students to 
get involved with CSG,” Griggs 
said. “So that is one way we 
are trying to engage with the 

student body. And not only get 
people involved with CSG but 
other student organizations.”

Former 
CSG 
President 

Cooper Charlton, a University 
alum, said his administration 
tried taking steps to provide 
similar 
scholarships 
for 

undocumented students, but 
ran into legal issues. He said 
he appreciated how Schafer 
and Griggs have found ways to 
fund scholarships within legal 
and community boundaries.

Schafer said he has also been 

working with other student 
organizations and encouraging 
students to participate more in 
student government.

“The next semester, we are 

going to encourage students 
to run in the CSG elections … 
encouraging students to get 
more involved,” Schafer said. 
“It’s an organization that will 
be here beyond our time on 
campus and one that has the 
ability to really better the lives 
of students.”

The day after President-

elect Donald Trump’s win, 
Schafer also spoke at a vigil 
in support of marginalized 
students. During the gathering, 
he called for students to call 
out discriminatory actions on 
campus.

“To all that have been 

targeted 
or 
marginalized: 

You have a place on this 
campus,” he said during the 

the 
vigil. 
“The 
University 

of Michigan is yours just as 
much as anybody else’s. Don’t 
stop challenging each other. 
So I am challenging everyone 
here tonight who professes 
to be an ally — whenever 
you hear a microaggression, 
whenever you hear an act of 
discrimination and bigotry or 
injustice perpetrated by one 
of your friends or any one of 
your acquaintances, step up 
and challenge them. Because 
if you don’t, you are part of the 
problem.”

In 
an 
interview, 
he 

emphasized 
working 
with 

other communities, such as the 
Muslim Students’ Association, 
to 
become 
more 
available 

for those who feel unsafe on 
campus. Schafer said CSG 
hopes to be a part of student 
gatherings such as the vigil 
and to become a resource for 
those who need it on campus.

“(The vigil) was for the need 

for students of all different 
backgrounds, of all different 
identities, 
of 
all 
different 

political beliefs really to come 
together to lift this campus up,” 
he said. “To continue to elevate 
Michigan so it reflects our very 
best selves and our high ideals. 
And anytime we get a chance 
to ensure the safety and the 
welfare of students, anytime 
we get a chance to interact 
with them, it’s an opportunity 

we are naturally going to seize. 
So I am looking forward to 
continuously 
watching 
this 

campus improve.”

CSG 
Communications 

Director Joe Shea, a Public 
Policy senior, said one of his 
goals for the next semester 
is creating partnerships with 
other student organizations to 
plan future similar events.

“I try my best to keep myself 

up to date with events that 
are 
happening 
on 
campus 

and I would hope student 
organizations that are looking 
to approach CSG would feel 
comfortable reaching out to 
us and letting us know what is 
going on,” Shea said.

Griggs said another way 

CSG is taking steps to improve 
campus climate is through 
the 
new 
“It 
Starts 
with 

Me” 
campaign 
that 
hopes 

to establish CSG members 
as allies for those who feel 
marginalized on campus.

The “It Starts with Me” 

campaign is led by Griggs and 
hopes to raise awareness of 
discrimination 
on 
campus. 

The campaign also responded 
to the anti-Black, anti-Muslim 
and anti-LGBTQ posters seen 
around campus this fall.

Griggs 
explained 
CSG 

is handing out wristbands 
and 
banners 
for 
student 

organizations 
who 
support 

the 
campaign 
and 
hopes 

to work with The Program 
on Intergroup Relations to 
facilitate ally workshops.

“We 
really 
just 
wanted 

to call in students to be an 
ally through their actions, 
and it can just be something 
symbolic like signing a poster 
but also to bring awareness to 
these issues,” Griggs said in 
an earlier interview with The 
Michigan Daily. “Sometimes 
events on campus occur and 
students 
just 
brush 
them 

under the rug or they forget 
about it, but communities are 
hurting.”

Charlton 
praised 
Griggs 

for her proactive approach in 
responding to campus climate 
issues.

“Something that I recently 

learned was self-exploration 
leads to self-love which leads 
to people love,” Charlton said. 
“I think that’s one of the things 
the campus tries to work 
toward, but a large part of that 
starts with one’s relationship 
with themselves.”

Griggs also noted that CSG 

has 
been 
connecting 
with 

students through town hall 
events. 
For 
instance, 
CSG 

held its first town hall in early 
October on affordable housing, 
organized by Nadine Jawad, 
a Public Policy junior. Jawad 
said the town hall was a way to 
gather student interest on the 
topic and was a starting point 

for future town halls.

The 
event 
was 
mostly 

attended 
by 
student 

government 
members 
and 

Ann 
Arbor 
employees 
and 

residents.

During the CSG debates 

last year, Charlton said there 
was a disconnect between the 
student government and the 
student body.

“I definitely think CSG has a 

lack of trust from the student 
body right now,” Charlton said 
last year. “It’s something we’ve 
tried to fight this year, and 
unfortunately I don’t think we 
completed our goal.”

In an interview, he said he 

believes the role of CSG should 
empower student voices and 
actions on campus, especially 
against 
disenfranchisement 

and should take steps with 
the administration to protect 
students. 
Chartlon 
added 

he 
feels 
like 
the 
Schafer 

administration 
has 
taken 

positive steps toward student 
communication.

“One thing I have noticed 

is that CSG this past semester 
has 
been 
much 
more 

communicative 
with 
the 

student body than I believe 
we were last semester,” he 
said. “They’ve done a good 
job of being more connected 
to students. So, I would like to 
see them continue that into the 
second semester.”

major sources of support. This 
has been another cultural 
shift for her, as back in 
China, swimming was more 
individually focused.

“When you’re tired, you 

have your teammates around 
you when you need them,” Bi 
said. “Even if you don’t say, ‘I 
had a bad day,’ they ask you 
and talk to you and make you 
feel much better. ... You just 
challenge yourself because 
you do it for your teammates 

and for the team.”

Despite 
the

she has faced, Bi is proud of 
what she has accomplished so 
far and is hungry to achieve

more than worthwhile.

“This was one of the best

I 

am sitting here writing this 
column, and in another tab 
of my nifty web browser, the 

New York Knicks are playing. I 
am alone, hunkered 
down in my basement 
as 
wet 
muck 
falls 

from the sky outside. 
Nobody wants to watch 
sports with me. 

In 
the 
seconds 

before I tell people that 
yes, I’m a sports fan, a 
pit of insecurity forms 
in my gut. To give you 
a sense, I’m an English 
major with a women’s 
studies minor, I live in a 
co-op previously called 
Michigan Socialist House, my 
full name is Isaiah David Aaron 
Zeavin-Moss, I’m from Brooklyn, 
N.Y. and I campaigned for Bernie 
Sanders. And the people I speak 
to 
generally 
associate 
sports 

with obnoxious men who yell 
misogynistic things about each 
other and excessive drinking and 
people rioting in the streets in 
destructive ways after their teams 
lose. My friends, dear to me, see 
these instances of gross behavior 
and they write off the entire 
institution of sports.

But 
this 
attitude 
ignores 

fundamental elements of sports. 
All social arenas as large and as 
layered as the world of sports 
— music, politics, etc. — contain 
cultures within them. And these 
subcultures respond in varying 
ways to the thing which they all 
are celebrating. For example, you 
are reading The Michigan Daily. 
This means you must respect 
journalism. But there is an entire 
cult within journalism that spends 
hours debating the merits of the 
Oxford comma. People spend 
hours talking about the difference 
between paratactic and hypotactic 
writing styles in ways you would 
find obnoxious. What does any of 
that mean, you ask? Who cares? 
You wonder as your jaw hangs 
wide open and your friends around 
you struggle not to laugh because 
of the mayonnaise you have on 
your chin that you’re ignoring 
in order to make a point about 
how outraged you are about the 
conversation topics that people 
find worth their time? Yeah! Me 
too! But here I am, gnashing away 
at my keyboard for the sake of this 
newspaper.

Certain publications even use 

ludicrous, 
offensive 
language 

just to grab your attention. This 
is corrupt. News sources, as 
such, know they have your trust 
and they will manipulate you 
because of it. And yet no one on 
this campus would see somebody 
reading a news source and, with 
a blanket statement, simply say, 
“Oh. I don’t like news sources. 
Now, since that person’s reading 
one, I’m going to judge them. 
I don’t want to be friends with 

someone who reads newspapers.”

There is no nuance in this 

closed-minded 
perception 
of 

sports. Sports is (are? Sports lets 

you have fun with 
grammar! The beauty 
is in the ambiguity, 
people!) a celebration 
of psychologies, of 
thinking about these 
people as characters, 
of 
narrativizing 

their 
lives, 
of 

finding 
moments 

of attachment with 
these 
figures, 
the 

same way we watch 
shows or politicians 
on TV and think 

about how cute or fun or silly 
this person is and wow I love 
watching them just speak.

I think about this sort of 

narrativization all the time. 
Throughout 
my 
childhood, 

my family and I would watch 
as our favorite players would 
act out their extensive secret 
handshakes 
in 
moments 
of 

triumph. We would watch as 
they would hug each other, 
crying, after defeat. We would 
criticize how the most famous 
player would hog the ball, to the 
detriment of our team. Haven’t we 
all experienced these phenomena 
(communally 
grieving 
over 

disappointment, grappling with 
the selfish person who acts 
selfishly in what should be a team 
effort (think of your latest group 
project for reference))?

Last night, even, I had a dream 

about one of the Knicks’ most 
dynamic players, Joakim Noah. 
Noah is new to the team this 
year, and he was having a really 
hard time with the pressures, the 
limelight, of New York City. He 
actually went to a school where 
I knew people, and we connected 
over this! I consoled him. We 
sat in the backseat of an Uber 
together, and I told him a joke: 
What do you call a man with no 
arms and no legs who’s trapped 
in a pot of vegetables? Stu! And 
he laughed! Oh, what joy, what 
sheer joy. There we were — me, 
the blubbering and drooling and 
snot-drenched boy coming to the 
aid of the 7-foot, man-bunned, 
NBA superstar, canoodling and 
commiserating over all that 
life has thrown at us. These 
people can become figures in 
our lives whom we admire and 
adore, onto whom we project our 
own admirations and fears and 
insecurities, with whom we live 
and grow up.

But back to psychologies. How, 

for example, do these young 
men cope with the immense 
pressures that come with their 
job? Baseball players have fewer 
than five milliseconds to react 
to a professionally thrown pitch. 
Imagine having that amount of 
time to perform an act which will 

decide the story written about 
you for the rest of time. How 
would you respond to that? These 
are people — everyday people, 
with backstories of triumph and 
tragedy and success — who are 
all responding to these pressures. 
Should we not embrace this 
institution?

And of course I think we need 

to criticize sports for all of those 
moments of crude, disgusting 
and violent behavior. They ought 
to be examined and they ought 
to be rooted out. On this campus, 
for example, I often cringe during 
gamedays where a crowd of 
essentially all white people drinks 
and parties while essentially only 
people of color clean up cans from 
the ground. Or, as has happened 
twice this semester alone, I was 
walking to the game with friends 
of mine from another school 
when University of Michigan 
students saw us and said, laughing, 
“Faggots!” What does that say 
about my school, that my tour of 
my everyday life here included 
this? And this violence is certainly 
part of the culture of sports.

But it’s also connected to 

cultural 
elements 
outside 
of 

football games. Greek life, for 
example, where so many infamous 
parties take place, promotes 
certain prototypically masculine 
ideals 
which 
put 
enormous 

pressure on its members to deride 
those who do not set those same 
standards for themselves. The 
people who, knowingly or not, 
decide not to take part in those 
standards become “faggots.” But 
something about the football 
games helps to bring out this 
culture, it is certainly true.

The University, then, must do 

more to combat this behavior. 
There must be greater awareness 
demanded of its students of 
certain social issues. A more 
concrete administrative effort 
to combat this hate speech — not 
in the form of advertisement 
campaigns or slogans, but in 
concrete, visible action. There 
needs to be a greater effort to 
promote understanding of why 
this language is so impactful and 
so destructive. 

Like all structural systems, 

sports has its deep, foundational 
flaws that are connected to other 
elements of American culture. 
But the solution is not to turn our 
collective heads from these flaws. 
Instead, we ought to consider 
them, to work on fixing them, while 
also embracing all the beautiful 
elements sports offers its audience: 
to celebrate camaraderie and to 
project our own fears and fantasies 
and expectations and loves and 
wishes, and to pour ourselves into 
them through narrativization and 
celebration of human will.

a 
neurosurgeon 
to 

lead the Department

But 
unfortunately, 

President-elect 
Donald 
Trump 

does. 
Trump 
has 

nominated University 
of

Ben Carson to head 
the

as secretary. Carson’s lack of 
experience and rhetoric prove 
he is unqualified for the position. 
As secretary, Carson’s decisions 
could have devastating impacts 
on fair-housing policies.

For context, the Department 

of 
Housing 
and 
Urban 

Development is an incredibly 
important agency, with 9,000 
employees and a budget of 
over $47 million. The primary 
goal of the agency is to operate 
several programs that provide 
housing assistance to low-
income families. The agency 
runs the Section 8 voucher 
program 
and 
the 
Federal 

Housing Administration, both 
of which play essential parts 
in providing housing support 
to millions of Americans. The 
department also enforces the 
Fair Housing Act to combat 
housing discrimination.

Just to be clear, nothing about 

Trump signaled that he was 
going to appoint an exceptional 
candidate. After all, this is 
the same person whose racist 
convictions guided his decision

background on the campaign 
trail. Whenever Trump spoke 
on the subject of urban housing, 
he had a tendency to conflate 
the “inner city” with “African 
Americans.” These are some 
pretty big red flags in regard 
to how Trump would structure 
an 
agency 
whose 
primary 

goals include enforcing a Civil 
Rights law he violated. Even 
still, Carson’s appointment is a 
pretty low blow.

Carson 
is 
an 
incredibly 

inexperienced nominee for the 
federal agency. Nothing about 
his education and career as a 
neurosurgeon 
has 
prepared 

him for the role as a federal 
housing expert. Furthermore, 
he doesn’t know a thing about 

running 
a 
federal 

agency. Don’t just 
take my word for 
it; Carson himself 
believes he would 
be 
unqualified 
to 

run a government 
agency. 
According 

to a Carson camp 
aide, “the last thing 
he would want to do 
was take a position 
that could cripple 

the presidency.” And yet today 
we see Carson accepting the 
role as the nominee. 

Prominent 
conservatives 

have responded to the claims 
that Carson is unqualified by 
saying his childhood experience 
growing up in public housing 
naturally qualifies him. That 
is not the case. While living in 
public housing doesn’t inhibit 
an individual’s potential to 
work in government, it also 
doesn’t 
necessarily 
grant 

someone the skills to run a 
government agency. Though 
the experience of growing up 
with government assistance is 
certainly valuable to consider 
when 
shaping 
government 

policy, it does not grant the 
skills necessary for secretary 
candidates. Receiving public 
assistance and running public 
assistance programs are very 
different things. In addition 
to Carson’s lack of experience, 
his individual responsibility 
mentality confirms he is unfit 
to run the program.

Throughout Carson’s self-

acclaimed 
“rags-to-riches” 

biography, he has an incredibly 
pervasive “pull yourself up 
by the bootstraps” mindset. 
Carson has admitted to the 
belief 
that 
“poverty 
was 

really more of a choice than 
anything else.” Furthermore, 
he has openly criticized the 
Affirmatively Furthering Fair 
Housing requirement as “social 
engineering.” 
The 
housing 

rule, which was implemented 
under the Obama presidency, 
requires 
local 
communities 

to halt housing segregation 
and implement procedures to 
address segregation. Carson’s 
statements display a failure to 
understand the social context 
in which housing problems, 
such as segregation, persist.

Housing 
segregation 
has 

a history based on policies 
that can also be labeled as 
what 
Carson 
calls 
“social 

engineering.” 
Douglas 

Massey and Nancy Denton’s 
novel “American Apartheid” 
provides 
an 
analysis 
that 

details 
the 
government 

intervention that created and 
expanded ghetto communities. 
Policies 
such 
as 
redlining, 

subsidizing 
suburbanization, 

slum 
clearance, 
widespread 

denial of Black mortgages, 
public housing concentration 
in minority and low-income 
communities and a lack of 
transportation infrastructure 
have all contributed to the rise 
of the urban ghetto.

Therefore, 
it 
is 
these 

government 
interventions, 

not the failure of individuals 
to pull themselves up by 
their bootstraps, that play a 
significant role in housing 
disparities. It is imperative 
that 
government 
practices 

work to compensate for this 
history. Solutions like the 
Affirmatively Furthering Fair 
Housing rule can accomplish 
this, but under Carson, these 
policies are in danger. As 
secretary, Carson has the 
potential to put us years back 
on 
federal 
desegregation 

efforts.

Unfortunately, repealing the 

fair housing rule is not the only 
damage that Carson could do as 
HUD secretary. He could gut 
the Section 8 housing program, 
which, 
despite 
its 
flaws, 

assists millions of Americans 
in paying their rent. Carson 
could also gut Fair Housing Act 
enforcement efforts, allowing 
businessmen 
like 
Trump 

free rein to discriminate in 
their 
housing 
complexes. 

Carson 
is 
undoubtedly 

unqualified to be secretary of 
the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development. I 
hope that Carson proves me 
wrong 
and 
reinforces 
the 

housing assistance the federal 
agency 
provides. 
However, 

his individual responsibility 
mindset and open criticism 
of desegregation efforts lead 
me to believe he will only do 
damage as secretary.

CJ MAYER | COLUMN
Trump, Democrats and the future of populism
P

resident-elect 
Donald 

Trump’s 
rhetoric 

outflanked the Democrats 

in one crucial aspect 
this year: the idea of 
populism. Populism, 
the movement of the 
masses against the 
elite and powerful, 
has 
typically 

been 
utilized 
by 

Democrats in recent 
years to decry Wall 
Street and the “1 
percent.” But in an 
election in which the Democratic 
candidate was a symbol of the 
establishment and ruling class, 
the Republican Party was able 
to steal the anti-elite rhetoric 
from its political rivals. Among 
the many issues where Trump’s 
policies 
will 
likely 
differ 

from his campaign rhetoric — 
especially given his decisions 
in the month after Election Day 
— few could be as stark as this 
appeal to populism. The swamp 
doesn’t seem to be draining all 
too quickly.

It starts with his Cabinet and 

closest advisers. One of the most 
important Cabinet members, 
secretary 
of 
the 
treasury, 

will be Steven Mnuchin, the 
finance chairman for Trump’s 
campaign. Trump repeatedly 
claimed on the campaign trail 
that “Wall Street has caused 
tremendous 
problems 
for 

us,” that he knows the guys 
at Goldman Sachs and that 
these people have total control 
over politicians. He even tied 
Hillary Clinton to Goldman 
Sachs in a final campaign ad, 
suggesting 
Clinton 
would 

implement policies to help the 
banking 
industry. 
Rhetoric 

such as this gave Trump the 
populist mantle. Interestingly 
enough, his pick for the most 
important economic position 

is a 17-year Goldman Sachs 
alum, who drove a Porsche in 
college and named the hedge 

fund he founded after 
an area near his house 
in the Hamptons. This 
doesn’t 
sound 
like 

the man to carry the 
populist torch Trump 
talked about.

And 
then 
he 

announced 
his 

nomination for secretary 
of commerce, Wilbur 
Ross. When George W. 

Bush put his Cabinet together 
in 2001, he was lambasted for 
having too wealthy an array of 
advisers who were out of touch 
with the American people — their 
net worth was about $250 million. 
Wilbur Ross alone is worth about 
10 times Bush’s entire Cabinet.

All 
told, 
Trump’s 

administration could be worth 
up to $35 billion! Let’s not 
forget Steven Bannon, Trump’s 
chief strategist, who will be yet 
another Goldman Sachs alum 
with the immediate ear of the 
president. Raging against those 
affiliated with the banking 
industry and Goldman Sachs, 
Trump has surrounded himself 
with an awfully large number 
of them.

It’s warranted to criticize 

Trump’s Cabinet as out of 
touch because of the collective 
wealth of its members, but in 
reality it comes down to the 
policies they enact and how 
those will affect millions of 
Americans. And the policies 
he has suggested, at least early 
on, are in line with his choices 
for 
advisers. 
For 
example, 

Trump’s 
tax 
plan 
would 

eliminate the federal estate 
tax that targets 0.2 percent of 
the wealthiest Americans. Half 
of his proposed tax benefits 
would directly benefit the top 

1 percent. He has said that the 
federal minimum wage should 
be abolished. 

Trump and Mnuchin have 

said they want to “strip back” 
and 
dismantle 
the 
Dodd-

Frank Wall Street Reform and 
Consumer Protection Act. Dodd-
Frank, enacted in response to the 
Great Recession, was intended 
to reform and regulate Wall 
Street so that a similar crisis, 
like one created by recklessness 
on Wall Street, wouldn’t happen 
so easily again. It’s a symbol of 
the populist reaction to the 
Great 
Recession. 
Trump’s 

desire to dismantle it, jointed 
with his positions on taxes and 
the minimum wage, is a signal 
that the populist rhetoric of his 
campaign could end when he 
begins to actually govern.

When evaluating potential 

Democratic responses to the 
next four years of Trump, 
populism presents a powerful 
chance to take advantage of 
emerging 
voter 
tendencies. 

In terms of rhetoric, the likes 
of Elizabeth Warren, Bernie 
Sanders and their mass of 
followers 
must 
carry 
the 

populist 
mantle. 
Attacking 

Trump directly for what he 
says won’t be enough — look 
no further than the election 
for evidence. Democrats would 
be wise to establish a singular, 
policy-oriented line of attack.

Trump 
rode 
into 
power 

on the wave of anger at the 
establishment, but now he’s the 
establishment, surrounded by 
the same flourishing fish in the 
same swamp. It’s time for the 
Democrats to become the party 
of populism — the party of the 
people — once again.

Year in Review: Wide Receivers

With the Michigan football 

team’s 2016 regular season in 
the books, the Daily looks back 
at the performance of each unit 
this year and looks ahead to the 
future in 2017. In this edition: 
wide receivers.

They were what we thought 

they’d be — sort of.

Returning 
two 
fifth-year 

seniors from an impressive air 
attack, the Wolverines delivered 
exactly the type of overall 
receiving 
season 
they 
were 

expected to in 2016.

The roles reversed for Jehu 

Chesson and Amara Darboh 
— with the latter emerging as 
the go-to target and the former 
a complement — but the total 
impact 
was 
similar. 
When 

Michigan wanted to throw the 
ball, it had targets it could count 
on around redshirt sophomore 
quarterback Wilton Speight.

Darboh 
and 
Chesson 

combined 
for 
1,295 
yards 

between them, just 54 fewer 
than they posted a year ago. 
And while the team’s total 
passing yards were down — a 
consequence of several blowout 
wins and a late-season injury 
to Speight — the Wolverine 
receivers ensured an efficient 
passing game was still a core 
tenant 
of 
Jim 
Harbaugh’s 

offense.

HIGH POINT: When Central 

Florida stacked the box to take 
away 
the 
Michigan 
running 

game in the second week of the 
year, Darboh and Chesson made 
the Knights pay. Darboh posted 
five catches for 111 yards and two 
touchdowns, with Chesson adding 
four receptions for 84 yards.

It wasn’t often that teams 

could 
entirely 
shut 
down 

Michigan’s stable of backs, and 
in many games, the Wolverines 
led by so much that receivers 
were a moot point by the 
second half. You don’t typically 
need a big play when you’re up 
by 30 points.

But against the Knights, an 

aggressive run defense forced 
Speight to take the reins. He 
responded 
by 
throwing 
four 

touchdown 
passes 
(including 

three in the first quarter), with 
Darboh’s 30-yard dagger in the 
fourth sealing a 51-14 blowout win.

LOW POINT: Some of the 

Wolverines’ struggles at Kinnick 
Stadium are easily explained. 
The Iowa crowd was sufficiently 
rowdy to host the nation’s No. 
3 team, and Speight struggled 
against a surprisingly tough 
Hawkeye defense.

But it was hardly all Speight’s 

fault. Late in the game, with the 
outcome still in doubt, Speight 
found Chesson at the sideline 
for what would have been a first 
down. Instead, though, Chesson 
couldn’t hang on, and Manny 
Rugamba took the pass away at 
the Hawkeyes’ 25-yard line.

With a completion there, the 

Wolverines would have been in 
field-goal range with a chance 
to go up 16-11 or better with 
under four minutes remaining. 

Instead, the Hawkeyes went on 
to win, 14-13.

It didn’t come down to that 

one play, though. Michigan 
threw for just 103 yards all 
game, not enough to win in an 
imposing road environment. If 
there was a game the Wolverine 
receivers could have back, this 
one would no doubt be high on 
their list.

THE 
FUTURE: 
With 

Chesson and Darboh departing, 
the future is a bit unclear.

Sophomore 
slot 
receiver 

Grant Perry was in and out of 
the offense this year, but he 
showed solid potential. His 183 
receiving yards were fifth-most 
on the team and the third-most 
by a wide receiver.

The main question is who will 

fill in around him. Freshmen 
receivers Eddie McDoom and 
Kekoa Crawford both got their 
feet wet in the offense, but 
McDoom was primarily used 
on jet sweep and screen plays. 
He had five catches for 59 yards, 

and Crawford added four for 47. 
The Wolverines will need both 
to step up and fill the shoes of 
Darboh and Chesson.

In addition, redshirt junior 

receivers Drake Harris and 
Maurice Ways will be looked to 
as veterans to step up. Harris 
was a highly touted recruit who 
struggled with injuries early 
and has yet to make a significant 
impact, while Ways has drawn 
praise for his contributions 
blocking, 
but 
struggled 
to 

produce statistically.

As 
for 
incoming 
players, 

Michigan is reportedly targeting 
some of the nation’s best high 
school receivers — including 
Detroit Cass Tech’s Donovan 
Peoples-Jones — and some could 
contribute early.

There will likely be some 

clarity by the end of spring 
practice, when the Wolverines 
have had their extra bowl 
practices 
plus 
their 
spring 

allotment to evaluate their next 
crop of receivers.

Darboh emerges as top target; Chesson provides additional big-play threat

SAM MOUSIGIAN/Daily

Fifth-year senior wide receiver Amara Darboh became Michigan’s top pass catcher this season with 826 yards.

Michigan hopes road 
stretch pays off later

Since the Michigan women’s 

basketball team last played at 
Crisler Center against Western 
Michigan 
on 
Nov. 
21, 
the 

Wolverines have traveled to 
the Virgin Islands, Atlanta and 
Cincinnati.

Michigan 
had 
a 
largely 

successful start to its odyssey as 
it posted a 3-1 record in the first 
four contests away from Ann 
Arbor. The Wolverines defeated 
then-No. 25 Gonzaga in the 
Virgin Islands, 78-66, as well as 
Georgia Tech, 92-52, while their 
only defeat came at the hands of 
then-No. 10 Florida State.

Both Michigan’s offense and its 

defense clicked against Georgia 
Tech. Junior guard Katelynn 
Flaherty tallied 25 points while 
junior forward Jillian Dunston 
achieved a double-double with 
10 points and 12 rebounds. 
Meanwhile, the 
defense 
held 

Georgia Tech to 
just 29.3 percent 
shooting.

“It 
was 

surprising,” said 
Michigan coach 
Kim 
Barnes 

Arico on WTKA 
radio. “They’re a 
good team, and 
they came into 
the game undefeated. We knew 
it was going to be tough playing 
at their place, especially with the 
schedule that we’ve had. But our 
kids were really locked into the 
game plan, and they’re getting 
better defensively.”

But in Monday’s 61-58 loss 

to Xavier, which has yet to play 
away from Cincinnati, all of the 
miles the Wolverines have logged 
seemed to finally catch up to them.

Though 
Flaherty 
compiled 

21 points, only one other player 
— senior guard Siera Thompson 
— 
scored 
in 
double 
digits 

Monday night. Michigan shot 
an uncharacteristically low 33.9 
percent from the floor and was 

outrebounded, 46-32.

The Wolverines still had a 

chance to walk away with a win, 
though, as they held a 58-57 
lead with 1:02 in the fourth. But 
the 
better-rested 
Musketeers 

answered with a two-pointer 
and two free throws to saddle 
Michigan with its second defeat 
of the season.

“Xavier did a really good 

job taking us out of what we 
wanted to do,” Barnes Arico said. 
“They tried to limit Katelynn, 
Siera, (freshman guard Kysre 
Gondrezick) and our scorers, and 
try to have our non-scorers shoot 
the ball. I think our confidence got 
shaken a little bit because we were 
asking people that normally don’t 
shoot the ball to score for us.”

Though 
Barnes 
Arico 

acknowledged the difficulties of 
such an extended road trip, she 
pointed out a silver lining. During 
Big Ten play, the Wolverines have 
two sets of back-to-back road 

games — against 
Wisconsin 
and 

No. 12 Ohio State 
and then against 
No. 4 Maryland 
and Nebraska.

From a travel 

perspective, 
those 
voyages 

will 
pale 
in 

comparison 
to 

the one Michigan 
is currently on, 

and the Wolverines may even be 
better prepared to handle the 
grind because of the grueling 
nature of the current stretch.

“Siera said to me after the 

(Xavier) game, ‘Coach, my legs 
haven’t felt like that in four 
years,’ ” Barnes Arico said. “I 
think that the travel is kind of 
getting to us a little bit. But we 
keep preaching to our team that 
this is going to prepare us for 
March. We are hoping that this 
helps us in the long run.”

But before then, the Wolverines 

will add over 5,000 more miles to 
their itinerary, as their next games 
are at San Diego State on Friday 
and No. 9 UCLA on Sunday.

“I think that 
the travel is 

kind of getting 
to us a little bit.”

Michigan’s first line looking to 
break out of offensive slump

At 
one 
point 
this 
past 

weekend, 
freshman 
forward 

Will 
Lockwood 
deftly 

maneuvered past a Nittany Lion 
defenseman and found himself 
with a chance to score against 
then-No. 7 Penn State. But 
Lockwood’s shot rang off the 
crossbar, missing the target by a 
matter of inches.

It was the difference between 

the Wolverines tallying a crucial 
goal against a tough Penn State 
squad and coming up empty 
once again.

The production from the 

top line of Lockwood, Jake 
Slaker and Alex Kile has cooled 
considerably since its scorching 
start to the season. It hasn’t 
tallied a point since Michigan’s 
4-0 win over then-No. 4 Boston 
University on Nov. 11, going 
scoreless in the five games since 
— over which the team’s record 
is an ugly 1-4.

While the goals and assists 

have yet to materialize, the first 
line remains confident in its 
abilities. Lockwood attributes 
the cold streak to bad puck luck 
— like on that near-goal against 
Penn State.

“I feel like I’m still getting 

good opportunities,” Lockwood 
said. “The only time you need 
to start worrying is when you’re 
not getting those opportunities, 
but I think they’re there, and I 
think I just haven’t been getting 
the bounces I wanted.”

Added Michigan coach Red 

Berenson: “As long as you’re 
getting 
chances 
and 
you’re 

playing hard and you’re playing 
the right way, then sooner or 
later it’ll go in.

“Part of it is confidence, part 

of it is execution, part of it is 
work ethic and part of it is just 
staying with the game plan and 
being patient.”

Despite the slump, Lockwood 

and Slaker still have the first and 
second-most points on the team, 
respectively, while Kile has the 
seventh-most — a sign of just 
how important their offensive 
performances are for Michigan. 
The Wolverines 
average just 2.50 
goals per game 
on the season, 
a number that 
dips to a paltry 
1.80 per game 
over the past five 
games.

For 

Lockwood, 
Slaker 
and 

Kile, there’s no 
alternative 
to 

hoping their luck will change 
but to put their heads down and 
to continue to work on being 
two-way forwards.

Berenson subscribes to the 

theory that the foundation of 
a good offense is a stalwart 
defense, one that constantly 
forces 
turnovers 
by 
the 

opponent. After all, you can only 
play offense when you possess 
the puck, and Michigan has the 
nation’s second-worst Corsi — 
which is a measure of possession 
through shots tallied versus 
shots given up.

“We’re just telling them they 

have to play hard, they have to 

play the right way and they’ve 
got to play good defense,” 
Berenson said. “If we play good 
defensively, then the offense 
will come. ... If you preach 
offense, you’re not going to get 
it. If you preach defense, you’ll 
get offense.”

Kile, 
a 
seasoned 
veteran 

and captain, has dealt with 
numerous slumps before. In 
his mind, winning is the best 
solution to breaking out of a 
slump. Michigan’s next chance 
to do that comes this weekend at 

Yost Ice Arena, 
where 
the 

Wolverines will 
play Wisconsin 
for a two-game 
series.

The 
only 

problem is that 
the 
chances 

of 
Michigan 

winning appear 
to be correlated 
to how well its 
first line plays. 

But while Michigan needs its 
first line to start scoring again, 
Berenson has tried not to put 
the “weight of the world” on 
their shoulders.

“They were scoring easy at 

the start of the year and now it’s 
a little harder,” Berenson said. 
“And it’s not just about scoring, 
but for those guys, you expect 
they’re 
going 
to 
contribute 

offensively.

“They know they haven’t 

scored, 
but 
they’re 
doing 

everything in practice to get 
into good habits so when their 
chance comes in a game, they’ll 
bury it.”

Wagner rises to occasion during winning time

Michigan coach John Beilein 

wanted to take Moritz Wagner 
off the floor.

In crunch time against Texas 

on Tuesday, Beilein thought 
senior forward Mark Donnal 
would 
be 
the 
more 
viable 

defensive option to prevent the 
Wolverines from suffering their 
second heartbreaking loss in 
seven days.

But 
assistant 
coach 
Billy 

Donlon had a different idea. 
Donlon convinced Beilein to 
keep Wagner in the lineup 
down 
the 
stretch 
because 

the sophomore forward was 
hedging the ball screen well.

In return for his confidence, 

Beilein received the ultimate 
payoff.

Down one, the Longhorns 

inbounded the ball to Eric Davis 
Jr. on the right wing with 9.5 
seconds left. He dribbled around 
the arc and down the lane and — 
as he revealed after the game — 
expected the play to give him an 
open layup.

He was met by Wagner 

instead. Rather than sticking 
with his original man, Shaquille 
Cleare, Wagner switched onto 
Davis after noticing the Texas 
guard wasn’t even looking in the 
direction of his rolling big man.

Wagner let Davis pull up 

for the contested shot, waited 
for gravity to start pulling him 
down and then blocked the 
attempt with just under six 

seconds left.

At the end of it all, Beilein’s 

faith in his assistant’s advice put 
Michigan on the right side of a 
nail biter. 

And 
his 
faith 
didn’t 
go 

unnoticed by Wagner either. In 
a young season where Wagner 
is still working on his defensive 
game, calling his block an 
“instinct play” in the postgame 
interview was a sign of progress. 
After all, his play on the 
defensive end has essentially 
been the only reason he isn’t 
averaging more than his 18.8 
minutes per game.

“Obviously it takes a lot of 

experience, and it helps me a 
lot that I know that people trust 
me out there,” Wagner said 
Tuesday night. “And that not 
every mistake (means) I’ve got 
to think about everything, that I 
can play with my instincts. That 
helps me a lot.”

Once 
junior 
guard 

Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-

Rahkman had secured the ball 
and earned a trip to the charity 
stripe 
after 
the 
block, 
the 

Wolverines had all but put the 
game on ice. Wagner wasn’t shy 
about his excitement.

The 
6-foot-11 
forward 

marched to the scorer’s table 
like a man possessed, fist-
pumping and chest-pounding 
his way down the sideline as 
he screamed toward the Maize 
Rage section that had just 
erupted into pandemonium.

The exuberant enthusiasm 

is nothing new from Wagner, 

though 
the 
moment 
felt 

different given that he was the 
hero of the night. But to him, it 
was a lot simpler than that, and 
to Beilein, this team is going to 
need that spark.

“I’m just so happy when we 

win,” Wagner said with a smile. 
“I can’t really control that.”

Added Beilein: “This is a team 

that their personality does not 
exude that type of excitement. 
We’re a little bit laid back. We 
don’t want it to show. … Zak 
Irvin gives us a lot of that. But 
after that, there’s a big dropoff of 
guys that it’s not natural to them. 
Moe, it’s very natural to him, and 
it’s very helpful to the team.”

And in case the energy and 

game-clinching 
block 
weren’t 

enough, Wagner put on the same 
offensive show that has been in 
his arsenal since his freshman 
year to win the game for Michigan 
on the other end as well.

With 25.2 seconds on the 

clock, and the Wolverines down 
one, senior wing Zak Irvin got 
the ball at the top of the key. 
Wagner set a screen and rolled 
to the rim as Irvin dribbled to 
the right block and went up for a 
doubly contested reverse layup.

The ball bounced off the 

backboard, but Wagner had 
been wedging his man the entire 
time. He corralled the rebound 
and kissed the ball off the glass 
as he was falling under the 
basket, giving Michigan its final 
lead with 20 seconds remaining.

“I got the rebound and didn’t 

really see the basket to be 
honest,” Wagner said. “Trusted 
myself a little bit, and it went in.”

After the game, Texas coach 

Shaka Smart praised Wagner’s 
versatility on both ends of the 
court, even going so far as to call 
him the best player on the floor.

But in reality, the best player 

on the floor almost sat out 
the final minutes in the first 
place. Without Donlon’s advice, 
it would have been Donnal 
checking in during crunch time.

Maybe Donnal would have 

hit the go-ahead basket and 
rejected Davis’ shot, too, but 
there’s no way for Beilein to 
know.

What he does know, though: 

he finally went with Wagner 
in winning time, and boy, did 
it look like he was meant to be 
there.

Is Virtual 
Reality the 
New Reality?

“Is this the real life? Or is 

this just fantasy?”

I am levitating in an orange-

and-black grid, reminiscent of 
the 1982 film “Tron.” My eyes 
widen with awe as a screen 
appears in front of me. In the 
next moment, I am floating 
alone in outer space, drawing my 
name and other symbols in the 
atmosphere. My environment 
suddenly changes and now I’m 
walking around in snow and 
attempting to paint a 3-D nose 
and eyes on a snowman. After 
that, I’m standing on a wrecked 
ship at the bottom of the ocean, 
watching a large blue whale 
pass me by, staring into my 
soul. I am unnerved, but oddly 
calm. Then, I’m transported to 
a colorful office, where I fulfill 
various tasks in my cubicle 
and take orders from my robot 
bosses. Did this really happen 
to me? No, but it certainly felt 
like it did.

This 
was 
part 
of 
a 

virtual reality simulation I 
experienced Tuesday night at 
the Duderstadt Center located 
on North Campus. Using the 
HTC Vive, a bulky headset 
equipped with two nunchuck-
like remotes, I was immersed in 
a cyber world with crystal-clear 
resolution that was beyond my 
own imagination. And yet, it 
was a world that could easily 
exist as our own.

Virtual reality possesses the 

power to control, manipulate 
and shape our own artificial 
world, 
offering 
a 
myriad 

of experiences that may be 
deemed 
impossible 
in 
real 

life. Though VR technology 
has been around for several 
years now, its advancement 
and growing accessibility has 
helped it become integrated 
into 
mainstream 
society. 

Augmented reality — technology 
that augments virtual objects 
in the physical world — has 
also become somewhat popular, 
most notably with this past 
summer’s craze over “Pokemon 
Go.” Once a rare, immensely 
expensive 
commodity, 
VR 

technology 
is 
available 
for 

purchase on our mobile devices 
and electronic stores, ranging 
from low-end platforms (the 
$15 Google Cardboard) to high-
end headsets (the $799 HTC 
Vive and the $599 Oculus Rift). 
Through 
motion-detection 

sensors, users can navigate 
naturally, manipulate objects 
and 
interact 
with 
virtual 

environments. They can watch 
movies, play video games and 
even 
visit 
exotic 
locations 

like the Big House. But while 
entertainment is an integral 
part of the VR experience, 
its technology has become so 
state-of-the-art that it also 
benefits health and education.

In 
September 
2015, 

engineering 
senior 
Duncan 

Abbot and a group of friends 
started Gwydion, a student-run 
startup club that specializes 
in 
VR 
and 
augmented 

reality 
technology. 
At 
last 

year’s 
MHacks, 
the 
semi-

annual hackathon held at the 
University of Michigan, the 
group won the game category. 
Now, Abbot — the president 
and CEO of Gwydion — and 
his peers are continuing to 
create newer, bigger things. 
Their most recent achievement 
was a VR-based tool made 
for 
children 
with 
physical 

disabilities at the C.S. Mott 
Children’s Hospital. The device 
was a biometric EMG controller 
that senses muscle signals and 
calibrates them wirelessly to a 
mobile VR app, which simulates 
a flying game. By controlling 
the field bar via the controller, 
the game allows the user to 
increase muscle movement.

“It provides a disconnect 

from the real world — not 
associating 
pain 
with 

something 
that’s 
actually 

happening — and experiencing 
in-game feedback,” Abbot said. 
“Those kinds of products that 
can take people who are limited 
in their ability to move and go 
places are the most positive 
impacts VR can have.”

In addition to the EMG 

controller, Gwydion is also 
currently developing a massive, 
self-conceived VR multiplayer 
online game. But Abbot noted 
that Gwydion “started with 
games, but found that there 
were ample and unexplored 
opportunities for non-games in 

the VR/AR space.”

The group is also working 

on 
Crystal 
Finder, 
another 

invention that will hopefully 
continue to expand VR beyond 
the 
realm 
of 
recreation. 

According to Abbot, Crystal 
Finder is a product that uses 
augmented reality to analyze 
crystal 
structures, 
as 
well 

as architectural and dental 
models. With help and guidance 
from the Materials Science and 
Engineering Department at the 
University, Abbot is hoping the 
device will be cheap enough 
for students to use and that it 
will be accessible through our 
phones and Google Cardboard.

“Having 
the 
multiple 

angles on VR is at the core of 
(Gwydion’s) business model,” 
Abbot said.

VR has certainly proven to 

be multifaceted. Along with 
Abbot, creative minds at the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
— 

students and faculty in the 
School of Art & Design, the 
College of Engineering and 
even LSA — are taking the 
opportunity 
to 
explore 
the 

limitless possibilities of VR/
AR technology in their own 
way. Dan Fessahazion, director 
of Digital Media Commons 
and manager of the Emerging 
Technologies 
Group 
at 
the 

Duderstadt 
Center, 
plays 
a 

pivotal role in guiding students 
and staff in embarking on 
ambitious projects with the 
help of VR/AR technology and 
the building’s video studios 
and 3-D labs. Having worked 
there since about the time of 
Duderstadt’s opening (almost 
20 
years 
ago), 
Fessahazion 

firmly believes that VR/AR 
technology cultivates creativity 

and innovation.

“The 
vision 
of 
the 

Duderstadt Center is to be a 
catalyst for collaboration and 
multidisciplinary artwork and 
empower 
engineers, 
artists 

and creators of all kinds to 
come work with us to deliver 
something 
that 
has 
never 

existed before,” Fessahazion 
said. “Our role is to identify 
the right tools, technology, 
software and delivery and then 
engage them as a team and help 
them structure their idea.”

By connecting and engaging 

with the campus community, 
Fessahazion helps figure out the 
needs of artists and engineers 
at the University who are trying 
to create projects. Working 
alongside Fessahazion is Travis 
Tamez, 
the 
visualizations 

systems specialist at the DMC. 
With a degree in mathematics 
and statistics from Central 
Michigan University, Tamez 
saw the job at the DMC as a way 
of broadening his horizons in 
terms of visualization. Similar 
to 
Fessahazion, 
Tamez 
is 

inclined to help students and 
faculty make their projects 
and ideas become reality. He 
talks to them about resources 
like the video studios, 3-D 
labs and visual consultants, 
subsequently 
guiding 
their 

visions on how they could fit into 
virtual and augmented reality. 
With VR/AR technology, Art 
& Design students can create 
multimedia, 360-degree videos 
and Engineering students can 
craft 3D-based projects. Due to 
the demand of content creators 
and users, VR/AR has become 
more 
financially 
accessible 

and thus grown immensely in 
popularity.

“It’s 
not 
just 
games 

anymore, but visualization and 
ecoterrorism and it’s driving 
the adaption rate,” Fessahazion 
said.

By working extensively in 

this specific field, Fessahazion 
and Tamez both recognize the 
benefits and the drawbacks 
of VR/AR technology. While 
Tamez touched upon the perks 
of entertainment and travel, he 
also mentioned health benefits 
including therapy treatments 
for PTSD and seeking MRIs in 

3-D. 

At the same time, however, 

VR/AR technology comes with 
downsides, primarily in its 
detachment 
and 
disconnect 

from 
actual 
reality. 
Abbot 

noted that with our increased 
attachment to escapism through 
our phones and computer, VR/
AR technology leads to further 
displacement 
from 
reality. 

Additionally, Fessahazion says 
that VR/AR technology “is not 
a shared experience yet,” in 
that users can only experience 
the VR world on their own and 
not with a virtual community of 
other VR users. 

“It insulates you from being 

aware of your environment 
and 
being 
aware 
of 
the 

complications VR produces,” 
Fessahazion said.

The VR environment can 

have both damaging short-term 
effects (mostly motion sickness) 
and long-term effects, such 
as implanting and inducing 
false memories during the VR 
experience.

It’s hard to not recognize 

the 
potential 
dangers 
that 

VR and AR could pose for our 
society in the future. Sci-fi TV 
shows are large proponents of 
this paranoia. In particular, 
the popular British anthology 
series “Black Mirror” provokes 
sharp, 
satirical 
commentary 

on the effects of technology, 
particularly 
virtual 
and 

augmented reality. The most 
recent season discusses the 
issues of VR and AR in heavy 
detail, depicting its likely uses 
in 
episodes 
about 
modern 

warfare 
(“Men 
Against 

Fire”), hyper-real video game 
simulations 
(“Playtest”) 

and 
even 
in 
everyday 
life 

(“Nosedive”). 
When 
Google 

Glass was released in 2013 
as a prototype, it elicited a 
polarized reaction, with issues 
concerning security, privacy 
and 
safety. 
Dave 
Eggers’ 

dystopian novel “The Circle,” 
which will be adapted into a 
film starring Emma Watson 
and Tom Hanks next year, also 
delves deep into the creeping 
emergence 
and 
perils 
of 

augmented reality technology.

“VR is more mature now and 

AR is a little behind, but AR is 
going to dominate down the 
line, has potential to change 
how we do things,” Fessahazion 
said.

After getting a taste of the 

VR and AR systems myself, 
I realized that most of its 
benefits often outweigh the 
costs, despite how disorienting 
the 
technology 
is. 
I 
first 

experienced the AR system 
using the Microsoft HoloLens, 
a device that projected life-size 
holograms of a mime, a zombie, 
a unicorn head and a hamster 
wheel onto real objects. I could 
pause and play the actions 
of each hologram, simply by 
motioning 
my 
fingers 
and 

hands. But when I tried on the 
HTC Vive headset, I entered 
another dimension. Everything 
I witnessed, from the giant blue 
whale to the snowman, felt 
eerily real. The possibilities of 
VR felt endless.

Considering the extremely 

rapid 
progress 
of 
today’s 

technology, the likelihood of 
everyone in the world owning 
a VR and/or AR system in the 
near future, whether on our 
phones or through glasses, is 
becoming more and more of a 
reality. The resistance against 
VR and AR is valid, but given its 
positive impact on advancing 
health and education, it seems 
like that kind of technology 
is here to stay and that we 
should 
embrace 
it. 
Visual 

and music artists have also 
already taken advantage of 
VR in their own craft. Taylor 
Swift and Childish Gambino 
have 
created 
360-degree 

music videos for their songs 
“Blank Space” and “Me and 
Your Mama,” respectively — 
apparently, Gambino is selling 
a virtual reality vinyl of his 
new funkadelic album “Awaken, 
My Love!,” as well, but ideas 
as to how that would look are 
currently 
unknown. 
Movies 

like “The Martian,” “School 
of Rock” and “Star Wars” are 
available to watch via the 
Oculus Rift VR headset.

Virtual 
(and 
augmented) 

reality 
may 
be 
scary, 
but 

it’s 
an 
innovation 
that 
is 

equally exciting and thought-
provoking. After my first-ever 
VR/AR experience, I wondered, 
“Was that a fantasy?” Nope, I 
realized soon after. This was 
real life.

 Just a few weeks ago, John 
Mayer dropped his first 
single in over three years. 
The artist debuted his track 
“Love on the Weekend” via 
Facebook live stream in 
which he also revealed that 
his 2017 album The Search 
For Everything will contain 
“more music than I’ve ever 
put out in any one year.”
 Mayer has spent the past 
few years touring with the 
Grateful Dead spinoff band, 
Dead 
& 
Company, 
dur-

ing which he met designer 
Jimmy Dean who helped 
him 
create 
an 
already-

sold-out, 
“Love 
on 
the 

Weekend” themed T-shirt.
 Like the tee, Mayer’s 
single is initially appeal-
ing and cozy. It sounds a 
bit like it should have been 
released as a soft, sum-
mer pop-rock single. The 
simple, 
chiming 
guitar 

chords echo throughout the 
track, giving it a dreamy 

depth. The country twang 
of 2013’s Paradise Valley 
pleasantly pervades “Love 
on the Weekend” — its 
hazy opening riff carries 
an August breeze into the 
gray winter work grind 

of its November release.
 It’s an easy listen; acces-
sible and honest with both 
its lyrics and calm strum-
ming pulse. Mayer’s open-
ing lines are relatable — a 
tad melodramatic, even. He 
sighs, “It’s a Friday, we’ve 
finally made it.” The sing-
er ruminates on fleeting 
love — a love reserved for 

the unrealistic ease of the 
weekends. Aware of his 
willing submission to even-
tual letdown, Mayer sings 
“I hate your guts, ‘cause I’m 
loving every minute of it.”
 “Love on the Weekend” 
is an intriguing introduc-
tion to John Mayer’s forth-
coming 
release, 
which 

he described as “a record 
that is fully me.” 17 years 
after the release of his 
first EP Inside Wants Out 
in 1999, Mayer admits that 
on his upcoming album, 
“I’m 
borrowing 
from 

my own sound finally.”

Forewarning: the original version of this analysis was deleted 

by my drunk alter ego just last night. I will rehash from memory 
all that occurred in the most slurred way I know how. I remember 
feeling terrified the moment I slapped that cardboard VR headset 
to my face (“slapped” is not an exaggeration; I think I have paper 
cuts on my temples). I was already floating on alcohol and now 
everything around me was too! The next thing I noticed was how 
nice my character’s butt was. Some things never change, no matter 
how intoxicated I am. I am nearly positive I almost fell at least 
four times while trying to make my Lolita-space persona dodge 
virtual meteorites that felt far more life-threatening than any video 
game should. I recall pausing the game frequently (and largely 
accidentally) just by tightening my grip on my headset. 

I am totally sober now and I still don’t know how that 

cardboard eye-box understood what I wanted. Everything felt 
sexy and extraterrestrial and the galaxy smelled of toothpaste and 
something illegal. I remember how I ended my original copy of this

VALLEY 9000

Nicolas Cage about to ghost ride the whip.

I love Shakespeare adaptation 

films that were clearly conceived 
by producers who never read more 
than the Sparknotes in high school 
— movies set in modern times with 
tangled romantic subplots that just 
barely seem to echo the old stories 
of the Bard.

There’s “O,” (2001), which 

turned Othello into a basketball 
player; “10 Things I Hate About 
You,” (1999), a classic, more-or-
less 
sexism-free 
high-school 

adaptation of “Taming of the 
Shrew”; “My Own Private Idaho,” 
(1991), in which Gus Van Sant sticks 
scenes from “Henry IV” into the 
streets of the Pacific Northwest; 
and 
there’s 
the 
criminally 

underrated “Get Over It” (2001), 
featuring a high school’s musical 
adaptation of “Midsummer Night’s 
Dream” (please watch “Get Over 
It” soon).

These films all take the skeletons 

of time-tested, classic stories and 
give them new personalities, new 
details and updated jokes. They 
work because they play with the 
formula yet still give audiences 
exactly 
what 
they’ve 
always 

wanted — love, betrayal and 
slapstick comedy.

But before any of these movies, 

there was Martha Coolidge’s 1983 
low-budget rom-com “Valley Girl,” 
which is like “Romeo and Juliet” 
only in the sense that two people 
who are different fall in love and 
one’s friends don’t really approve. 
Nobody even dies, man.

More than just one in a long 

list of “R&J” retreads, though, 
“Valley Girl” is one of the greatest 
underdog 
successes 
in 
film 

history. Coolidge was given a 
mere $350,000 to make the film, 
with the stipulation that there be 
multiple scenes with bare breasts, 
and somehow, she turned in a 
commercial smash and work of art 
that’s still worth watching today.

The plot is one of the oldest 

stories ever told. Boy meets 
girl. Boy and girl fall in love. 
Contrivances break boy and girl 
apart. Boy wins back girl. In this 
case, the boy is Randy (Nicolas 
Cage, believe it or not), and the girl 
is Julie (Deborah Foreman, best 
known for roles in some minor, 
cult-ish ’80s flicks). Randy is a 
punk from Hollywood. Julie is an 
OG Valley Girl. Julie’s friends don’t 
like Randy, which means she has to 
choose between him and them.

Coolidge, 
who 
also 
made 

“Real 
Genius,” 
perhaps 
the 

best-ever college-prankster film 
outside of “Animal House,” has a 
special knack for working within 
limitations of both genre and 
budget without succumbing to 
cheap gimmicks or tired clichés. 
Of course, we know the entire 
plot of “Valley Girl” the moment 
Randy and Julie lock eyes for the 
first time, but the world of these 
characters is portrayed in such 
a thrillingly engrossing way that 
plot doesn’t matter.

The entire first act, for instance, 

is reminiscent of a Richard 
Linklater film —even though 
“Valley Girl” was released over 
half a decade before “Slacker” 
hit screens. The opening scene 
with Julie and her friends at the 
mall is entirely in “Valleyspeak,” 
with characters throwing back 
and forth recently popularized 
phrases like “to the max,” “far 
out” and “gag me!” with authentic 
inflection. Immediately, we’re let 
into these girls’ lives in a way that 

feels as natural as a movie can be.

We then move to a party, which 

is where Randy and Julie first talk, 
but special care is taken to ensure 
that we’re at least a small part of 
every 
attendee’s 
conversation, 

even if they’re inessential to the 
main story. And when Randy 
gets thrown out of the party and 
has to sneak back in, he doesn’t 
immediately reunite with Julie. 
Instead, we’re treated to a long 
sequence of Cage looking bored in 
a shower as he listens to the other 
couples flirt and get high. Maybe 
these scenes were all shot just 
because they were cheaper than 
anything with action, but they give 
“Valley Girl” a unique, lived-in, 
almost cinéma vérité style.

Randy proceeds to take Julie on 

a beautiful tour of downtown L.A., 
where their perfect chemistry 
doesn’t fizzle out, even in the face 
of unfamiliar, intimidating (for 
Julie) sights. The shots of their 
driving tour of the city at night 
are stunning, with landmarks like 
the Chinese Theater captured 
alongside burlesque clubs, diners 
and a guy getting pulled over by a 
cop. It’s not often that a rom-com 
has a strong sense of geography 
— most of them take place in 
New York or just any generic 
city — but “Valley Girl” owns 
Los Angeles, making any viewer 
who has never been still feel like 
a local. (Meanwhile, Cage keeps 
hilariously yelling nonsense out 
the car at random people on the 
street: “Rico! Nah, you didn’t do 
that!”)

And when I saw Linklater’s 

“Everybody Wants Some!!” this 
year, the scene that most stood 
out to me was early on, when five 
baseball teammates were simply 
driving and rapping along to the 
The Sugarhill Gang. It’s perfectly 
sweet, and no other director, I 
thought, would linger that long on 
kids just listening to a song.

But Coolidge takes care to show 

her characters just hanging out, and 
that includes Julie and her friends 
lipsyncing 
to 
Bonnie 
Hayes’s 

“Girls Like Me.” It’s a fraction 
of the length of the Linklater 
sequence, but that moment kicks 
off one of the strongest scenes of 
the film — a simple slumber party 
where the girls talk about eating, 
boys and little siblings, with rapid-
fire dialogue that somehow avoids 
being too smart or overwritten 
while also remaining engaging. It’s 
so intimate that I almost feel guilty 
watching it — like I’m violating the 
characters’ privacy.

Foreseeing 
the 
independent 

films of the next decade, Coolidge 
approaches her subjects like a 
sociologist — studying what they 
do while not forcing them into any 
contrived problems. The conflict 
of “Valley Girl” is just the same 
conflict every high school junior 
has: “Who am I?” The director 
understands teenagers in a way 
few artists do. They don’t have 
clear motives; they’re not always 
consistent personalities. They’re 
just trying to learn and do what 
feels right.

Coolidge’s tremendous empathy 

for all of her characters is perhaps 
best exemplified by the roles 
of Julie’s parents. In most any 
other teen movie, parents are 
antagonists, whether they’re well 
meaning or not. They ground the 
kid or force them to do homework 
or forbid them to attend the party, 
and it’s up to the protagonist to 
work around the obstacles they 
lay down. However, in “Valley 
Girl,” Julie’s parents are fully 
developed people — members of 

the Woodstock generation who 
run a health food restaurant and 
try to give their daughter as much 
space and freedom as possible.

Her dad in particular steals his 

scenes, both as a solid advice-giver 
and, more comically, a guy who has 
to retreat to the bathroom to smoke 
a joint when it really hits him 
that his daughter is growing up. 
Together, amid all the hormones 
and confusion of the younger 
characters, Julie’s parents remind 
us that growing up and figuring 
out the world is a process we never 
completely finish.

Also notable in “Valley Girl” 

is a decided lack of cruelty. As 
Roger Ebert noted in his review 
at the time, “This is one of the 
rare Teenager Movies that doesn’t 
try to get laughs by insulting and 
embarrassing teenage girls.” It’s 
clear that Coolidge sees how to 
make the best possible versions 
of what could be painfully awful 
movies, and she challenges herself 
to go above and beyond what’s 
expected of a micro-budgeted 
exploitation movie called “Valley 
Girl.”

The soundtrack is unbelievable, 

filled with classic ’80s songs 
before they got tired out and some 
weird, exciting deep cuts. First 
of all, the rich kids’ party is filled 
with this weird, seemingly Joy 
Division-influenced 
post-punk 

that everyone loves to dance to in 
the dorkiest ways. If that scene 
is true to life, I’m super jealous. 
Beyond that, the prom is played 
by Josie Cotton, who sings the 
minor new-wave hit “Johnny, Are 
You Queer?” I don’t know about 
you, but I didn’t hear anything 
that provocative at my prom (well, 
maybe “Get Low”).

And most memorably, there is a 

literal three-minute falling-in-love 
montage set to Modern English’s 
then-new “I Melt with You,” 
which, coupled with cute moments 
of Randy and Julie around town, is 
earnest and endearing enough to 
improbably give that song new life 
for me.

Of course, there are still flaws in 

this movie. Cage, while charmingly 
goofy and bright-eyed with love, 
plays his “punk” character more 
like The Fonz than anyone who 
would truly seem dangerous, and 
when the plot wheels actually 
do spin they feel unnatural and 
rushed. But even so, I want to put 
“Valley Girl” in the lineage of films 
that brilliantly capture young 
people trying to figure out love, 
identity and what they want for 
the future — from “Boyhood” to 
“Mean Girls” to “Clueless,” all the 
way back to when “The Graduate” 
practically reinvented cinema.

The last shot of the film is, in 

fact, a direct invocation of “The 
Graduate” ’s famous ending, in 
which Hoffman and his bride 
are beaming in the back of the 
bus post-wedding. Like any other 
high school movie, “Valley Girl” 
climaxes with a prom scene, one 
that Randy disrupts in order to get 
Julie back, setting off a hilariously 
overdramatic fistfight and then 
foodfight.

Busting out of the gym, the 

couple hops in a limo and leaves 
for a hotel. They sit in the back 
seat, exhausted and high on 
endorphins. More than likely, 
this is a moment they’ll look 
back 
on 
with 
embarrassed 

nostalgia, after they’ve had 
other relationships and made 
more mistakes. But right now, 
this is the most thrilling night 
of their lives, and we’re right 
there with them.

COURTESY ANDREW BROPHY

When the acid hits.
RPG ‘Knuckle Sandwich’ developer 
talks indie gaming and roleplaying

Andrew Brophy reveals creative process behind his inventive new RPG

Over the past several weeks, 

motivated by hyperactive fandom 
and a selfish desire to learn about 
the inside world of making video 
games, I’ve set forth on a journey 
to discover the best and brightest 
projects active in the independent 
role-playing game scene.

First, I interviewed a team 

from Shanghai, a developer from 
Canada and a local student who 
dreamed of success in game 
development. Then, I spoke to 
a crew of undergrads at DePaul 
University 
whose 
Kickstarter 

garnered 
nearly 
$70,000. 
In 

the process, I was tipped off to 
possibly the most fascinating 
and promising project you’ve 
never heard of — Andy Brophy’s 
“Knuckle Sandwich.”

To put it simply, “Knuckle 

Sandwich” looks fucking rad. I 
would highly encourage you to 
check out the BATTLE SYSTEM 
PREVIEW 
video 
Brophy 

uploaded to YouTube — if your 
taste is anything like mine, you’ll 
be immediately struck by the 
saturated and colorful art style. 
Andy draws the graphics himself, 
but you wouldn’t know it just by 
looking at it. The look is unique: 
retro-inspired but not cloyingly so.

Next, you’ll chuckle at the clever 

fourth-wall-breaking 
dialogue, 

and the absolutely slappin’ battle 
music. Damn, that song. I don’t 
even know how to describe 
it 
— 
post-disco? 
Avant-garde 

digital funk? Regardless, calling 
it foot-tappingly orgasmic is an 
understatement.

Finally, you’ll see the brilliant 

innovations in the game’s combat. 
Some of the attacks go beyond 
the standard “press the button 
at the right time to do extra 
damage” and involve small-scale 
WarioWare-style 
mini-games, 

bouncing out of the screen and into 
a manic arena where the player is 
forced to confront a reflex-based 
challenge. I’ve never seen a game 
do something like this before.

I had to track down Andy’s email 

and hit him up for an interview. 
In an emailed response he was 
gracious and accommodating, but 
still a little cryptic — the perfect 
combination for an artist who 
knows he has something great in 
the works.

First the generic stuff — I’d 

love to hear about you, your 
history as a gamer and your 

history as a developer. 

To be honest, it’s a pretty 

regular origin story! I used to buy 
a bunch of video game magazines 
as a kid and often they’d include 
free games and software with each 
issue … I happened to find this neat 
little program called GameMaker 
when I was 11 and I just went 
from there. A year or so later, I got 
amongst a few maker communities 
online and I guess now I’m here?

You’re based in Australia, 

right? What part of it? Is there an 
indie development scene there?

That’s 
right! 
I’m 
from 

Melbourne, which has probably 
the biggest game development 
scene in the country. Last week, 
we literally had our International 
Games Week, which encompasses 
PAX, Unite and a few other 
conferences. It’s ridiculous how 
far the scene has grown here in the 
last few years — I started getting 
involved about five years ago and 
it was this nice and cosy group 
of people … Now we have these 
major events that attract many big 
international guests. It’s very cool.

Lots of people are comparing 

“Knuckle Sandwich” to the 
MOTHER series. Is that fair? 
Can you tell me about the games 
and people you’ve been inspired 
by as you’ve began developing 
“Knuckle Sandwich?”

It’s pretty fair! I’ve personally 

only played Mother 3, but that 
series ooze so much style that I feel 
they influence many of my other 
inspirations. Outside of games, 
I’m really inspired by American 
Psycho … but that should probably 
be a secret, heh.

Holy 
crap, 
the 
visual 

effects and sprite work in 
“Knuckle Sandwich” are rad. 
I read somewhere that it’s a 
GameMaker game, is that true? 
If so, how are you managing 
to accomplish such a visual 
complexity? 

You’ll find that being “good” at 

GameMaker usually means you 
know your way around its quirks. 
Honestly, it’s mostly black magic 
that makes it work. 

Are you the only one working 

on the game? What about the 
game’s music? It’s insanely 
awesome, by the way. 

I’m working with some very 

cool musicians on the game, 
including Captain Beard, Barch 
and Gyms. Other than that, I’m 
doing all the design, code, writing, 
art and marketing for the game! 
It’s exhausting, but it’s 100% worth 
it. 

What 
are 
some 
of 
the 

things you love about making 
independent games? What are 
some of the challenges?

I totally think the creative 

freedom is pretty sweet. I’m just 
making a game that’s comprised of 
things I like, so it’s really lovely to 
see that resonate with many other 
people. I also love the vibrant 
community … I’ve made so many 
close friends through making 
games, and that’s really my 
favourite take away from doing it.

Like I said before though, it 

is exhausting, especially in my 
situation where I’m doing the 
bulk of the work on the game. 
It’s very easy to feel burned out. 
Fortunately, I’ve gotten myself to 
a good place where I’m good at 
avoiding that!

Some aspects of the game’s 

combat seem to be inspired by 
mini/microgames 
like 
those 

featured in Mario Party and 
WarioWare. Can you tell me 
more about them? Where did 
that idea come from?

I hate puzzles in RPGs! I find 

they waste the player’s time more 
often than not. Minigames are 
more entertaining to me because 
they can be a completely fresh 
experience. With the tone of KS, 
it also means I can do something 
100% unexpected, yet it won’t feel 
out of place. 

It appears that there was 

a coordinated attack on one 
of 
your 
gameplay 
videos 

coming from 4chan. Was that 
disheartening to receive so 
much hate? What keeps you 
going through the process of 
creating the game?

If 4chan don’t like you, you’re 

doing something right … right? 
If the response to the game was 
overwhelmingly 
terrible, 
I’d 

probably be very down about 
working on it. Fortunately, for 
every person who doesn’t like it, 
there’s ten people who super dig it. 
It’s very lovely.

I know a lot of it’s probably 

under wraps, but I’d love to 
know more about the plot of 
“Knuckle 
Sandwich.” 
Also, 

what are some of the emotional 
and moral themes of the game? 
Is there a particular aspect 
of humanity you’re hoping to 
explore? 

I can’t reveal the major plot 

points, but I can say that a huge 
part of the story is about how 
people cope with loss, as well as 
how people’s ambitions can affect 
others. Is that cryptic enough?

 Now let’s get this out of 
the way: Kylie Lotz, formally 
known under the name Petal, 
is one of the best damn artists 
making music today. Her 
lyrics are sharply 
poetic, her voice is 
achingly soft and her 
melodies bemoan of 
heartache. Over a 
year after releasing 
her incredible debut 
album Shame, Lotz 
has put out a video 
for one of the more melancholy 
songs on the album titled 
“Chandelier Thief,” showcasing 
much of what makes her music 
so enticing.
 It’s a dark and often bare 
video, with shots of Lotz 
singing softly in different 
locations while staring 
longingly at the camera. 
Lotz is found walking around 

in alleys at night, or in almost 
entirely dark rooms except for 
her glowing frame. The song 
slowly builds on itself, with 
nothing except Lotz’s tender 

voice and a gentle 
electric guitar until 
over a minute and 
a half into the 
song, when Lotz 
sings, “I never 
asked you to watch 
me in my sleep.” 
The rest of the 

band kicks in as shots of 
Lotz with expressions 
from bemusement to 
understanding cut across the 
screen — her scenery never 
changes, but her emotions 
are symmetric to the song’s 
atmosphere.
 The video does a fantastic 
job reflecting the emotions of 
becoming distanced from an 

old lover or friend. Usually 
this transition is healthy, 
despite the harsh realization 
that change is rarely easy. 
As fireworks go off behind 
her, Lotz smiles and sings “No 
matter how much distance we 
put between / can’t guarantee 
we wouldn’t touch our feet,” 
granting resolution in the hope 
of making amends that were 
broken in the past.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

The adult prequel to the 

famous story of “Peter Pan,” 
the Tony-award-winning play 
“Peter and the Starcatcher,” 
will be performed tonight at the 
Power Center. With more music, 
more tech and more 
collaborations, 
the University of 
Michigan’s Theatre 
Department 
is 

prepared to take 
the 
audience 
on 

a 
new 
kind 
of 

journey. 

The story beings 

with 
an 
orphan 

named Boy, soon to 
be named “Peter.” 
He and a few other 
orphans 
set 
sail 

on the ship titled 
“The 
Neverland.” 

On this voyage, Boy 
meets Molly, the daughter of 
the Starcatcher Lord Aster. He 
and Molly discover a mysterious 
treasure chest which they soon 
learn cannot fall into the lap of 
evil pirate captain Black Stache. 
 

“This story involves rich and 

fabulous characters,” director 
and School of Music, Theatre 
& 
Dance 
professor 
Gillian 

Eaton said in an interview. 
She said the original story of 
Peter Pan was written among 
other “outrageous stories of 
adventures” that all involve 
“children and danger.” With 
300 individual props, a small 
pit orchestra and an intricate 
set, this has been one of the 
most demanding performances 
the theater department has put 
on.

“We 
are 
the 
Theater 

department, not the Musical 
Theater 
department,” 
Eaton 

said. But as a play with musical 

scores, it became “a wonderful 
challenge for the actors.”

One of the stage managers, 

LSA Senior Jacqueline Saldana, 
added that cross departmental 
collaboration 
is 
an 
intense 

accommodation they have had 
to incorporate, especially among 
lighting, props and costuming.

 With new opportunities 

for the actors 
and 
a 
tech-

heavy 
show, 

Peter and the 
Starcatcher can 
be 
considered 

a “simple, old 
fashioned story 
with 
modern 

technology,” 
assistant 
student director 
Marty McGuire, 
an 
SMTD 

Sophomore, 
said.

For 
cast 

members 
the 

experience of preparing for this 
performance has been unique 
for several reasons:

“This is different from any 

other show I’ve done while at 
Michigan. It’s an opportunity to 
explore something new with my 
classmates, and it means a lot to 
be able to create this exciting 
world with them.” said David 
Newman, an SMTD junior who 
plays Lord Leonard Aster

“The best part about Stache 

is that he sometimes cares more 
about proving to the audience 
that he’s the ultimate villain 
over the other characters on 
stage, breaking the forth wall 
like it’s his job,” said SMTD 
junior Jeffrey Fox, who plays 
Black Stache.

“Everyone 
(the 
cast) 
is 

always engaged in enhancing 
the audiences experience of the 
story we are telling,” said SMTD 
senior Sten Eikrem, who plays 

Robert Flacon Scott.

“Molly’s deep duality is what 

makes her so enjoyable to play. 
Her faith in humanity and 
her youthful ignorance is still 
very alive.” said SMTD senior 
Kourntey Bell, who plays Molly 
Aster.

“Playing Peter has been an 

amazing 
experience,” 
said 

SMTD junior Brooks Inciardi, 
who plays the Boy/Peter. “I’ve 
been thrown around, dropped 
off mountains and flown. J.M 
Barrie, the author of ‘Peter 
and Wendy,’ said it best when 
talking to a group of actors 
before opening their play for 
the first time: ‘All you need is to 
adorn yourself with the spirit 
of a child.’ That is what I do 
every night and what I hope the 
audience will leave with.”

In 
our 
interview, 
Eaton, 

McGuire and Saldana got to 
the root of why this show puts 
itself in its own category. They 
discussed childhood adventure 
–– that feeling of living life 
on the dangerous side. Eaton 
looked out to the set stage and 
asked, “Remember how you 
would dream of flying?”

And 
I 
did. 
Smiling, 
I 

reminisced about the time I 
asked my Mom for a Wendy 
nightgown for my birthday, and 
then another one for Christmas. 
She would ask me why my room 
was so clean, and I told her that 
I wanted it to be spotless for 
Peter Pan when he came to the 
window. 

The inner child in me lit 

up as the actores more deeply 
discussed 
this 
performance, 

the concept of taking chances 
and the reason why Peter and 
the Starcatcher is performing 
here on campus. It is made for 
the audacious kid that is still 
deep within all of us, itching to 
experience one more journey 
while we are still young.

Flashy high-tech play from SMTD to open this Thursday

Senior thesis ‘White Snake’ will slither 
into Walgreen, your heart and your soul

Enduring love story sheds light on urban legends and emotions alike

A classic legend that renders a 

story of love, courage and truth 
will travel from ancient myths and 
traditional oral storytelling to an 
adaptation set for the stage at the 
Power Center.

This weekend, School of Music, 

Theatre & Dance Senior Gregory 
Strasser directs Mary Zimmerman’s 
“The White Snake” 
as his senior thesis.

“The 
White 

Snake” 
tells 

the 
story 
of 
a 

serpent spirit who 
transforms 
into 

human form as a 
beautiful 
woman 

and travels to the 
mortal world with 
her friend Green 
Snake. Eventually, 
she falls in love and 
the play embarks 
on a journey of 
romance, exploring our inherent 
desire as humans to give and receive 
love. White Snake, played by SMTD 
junior Shenell McCrary must find 
the strength to seek something she 
has never before found — someone 
who accepts her and loves her fully 
for who she is.

“It is a timeless romance, because 

the entire play is about being seen 
for who you truly are,” Strasser said.

“The White Snake” originally 

premiered 
at 
the 
Oregon 

Shakespeare Festival in 2012 and 
later at the McCarter Theater in 
Princeton. It is an adaptation of an 
ancient Chinese legend, but has 
been reimagined for the American 
stage. As the story has evolved 
over time and moved through 
different places, the characters 
have changed, but the fundamental 
theme of the importance of love is 
woven through every piece of this 
tale.

“What the playwright has done 

in this particular adaptation is 
show that she wants to honor all 

the different interpretations of 
‘The White Snake,’” Strasser said. 
“Throughout the play, the narrators 
will pause the action and they’ll say 
‘that’s one way the story could have 
gone, but here’s another way the 
story could go too.’ ”

The play’s visual landscape forms 

through the characters’ creations, 
rather than a complex design for the 
set, costumes and props.

“We are trying to find as many 

things to touch into the magic 

of 
theatricality, 

without 
having 
to 

rely on the magic of 
technicality,” Strasser 
said. 
“Everything 

we are trying to do 
is generated by the 
actors.”

How much the cast 

has managed to create 
is remarkable.

“Together, 
the 

ensemble has built 
a boat, a cloud, a 
labyrinth, a thousand-
hand goddess, two 

gigantic snakes; choreographed a 
battle between the elements; and 
found a way to physicalize a forest 
and a storm,” Strasser said.

He explained that these creations 

have emerged because he has taken 
a step back and has left the actors 
with the opportunity to create, the 
product of this freedom has been 
incredibly rewarding for Strasser 
and the cast. Beyond the visual 
elements of this show, they grapple 
with complex themes and questions 
that Zimmerman’s script offers.

“There’s actually one really 

magical line in the play that I think 
sums up the author’s intent really 
well, which is ‘all forking paths 
lead to the same destination,’” 
Strasser said. “You can make so 
many different choices in your life 
that no matter what, at the end of 
the day you’re going to reach the 
destination.”

Strasser’s decision to direct 

this play for his thesis came from 
traditions of his childhood, as 
this Chinese legend was one of 

his bedtime stories. When he 
shared this with his mom, who 
is an immigrant from China, 
her response sparked Strasser’s 
analysis of a central question in this 
piece: who has the power to tell this 
story?

“She said, ‘You know you have to 

use Chinese people in it, because it’s 
a Chinese story.’ I wasn’t totally in 
agreement with that,” Strasser said. 
“I understand if you’re going to tell 
a story from a certain perspective, 
especially if it has racial identity as 
a major theme of it, then you better 
cast it that way. But in this case, 
racial identity isn’t the theme of 
this show. The theme of the show is 
love. And everybody can experience 
love.”

Strasser’s inclusion of different 

identities and voices has helped 
him preserve the fundamental 
truth of this play: that love 
is available to all. This story 
showcases its beauty in many 
forms. The cast emphasizes that 
everyone has the right to tell a 
story and everyone has the right to 
hear a story. This piece unites all 
people through these differences.

“The reason I love this play is that 

it demonstrates the universality 
of human spirit, which is that we 
want to be loved and we want to be 
truthful about how we are loved,” 
Strasser said. “You don’t need to be 
Chinese to be that. You don’t need to 
be anything to be that. That is just a 
human thing.”

Overall 
Strasser 
said 
his 

directing experience was both 
rewarding and exciting, including 
experimentation 
with 
different 

ideas and perspectives and an 
honest look into some of the most 
beautiful and painful aspects of the 
journey to find love.

“There are so many people who 

are so afraid of being seen as who 
they truly are and I think it’s the 
most courageous thing that you can 
do to come out and say: ‘Love me 
and take me as I am,’ ” Strasser said. 
“And it’s even more courageous for 
the person to respond and say: ‘I do 
love you.’ ”

Versatility and the jack of all trades

In our daily devotion to reach 

greatness, we as a culture, have 
come to realize we cannot be just 
one thing. The world is no longer 
satisfied 
with 
one-dimensional 

beings 
who 
offer 

mastery in just one 
area out of the vast 
dimensions composing 
our world. There has to 
be more to us than just 
one feature. We have to 
be good at our craft, but 
also knowledgeable in 
the areas surrounding 
it and complementing 
it — even in areas barely 
related to what we 
know.

The process of becoming well 

rounded emerges in stages; you 
start at one place and gradually 
prepare to take on more, little 

by little. It’s kind of like learning 
a language; first you get the 
grammar 
down, 
sentence 

structure, then vocabulary. Then 
you 
move 
towards 
adopting 

the 
conversational 

elements of language 
and 
start 
learning 

about 
the 
culture 

surrounding 
it. 

However, one language 
isn’t enough. Now that 
you’ve gained fluency 
in one, it’s time to 
move onto the next. Be 
well-versed in many 
languages 
so 
that 

you can display your 

versatility. 

You’re not just working towards 

becoming the best writer. Or the 
best singer. Or the best actor. Dancer. 
Musician. Director. Producer. You’ve 

got to be working towards acquiring 
a wide range of skills.

Resumes have to offer bits and 

pieces of what compose the whole. 
If I want to be a great writer, I 
have to learn how to become a 
great editor, a great reader and 
a great critic. The etymological 
history of this term dates back to 
1764, as “well-rounded” was to be 
“symmetrically 
proportioned.” 

One aspect of us can’t weigh too 
heavily on the other parts. It’ll 
offset the balance. It’ll force us to 
admit we can’t do A, B and C. Only 
A. Yet, it seems that isn’t enough.

Lin-Manuel Miranda, a name 

you’ve probably heard nonstop 
lately, provides a beautiful example 
for what a well-rounded person 
really looks like. He is referred 
to as an actor, rapper, composer, 
playwright and writer. Miranda 

does all of this and does it well, 
offering the paradigm for a well-
rounded artist. Best known for 
his lyrics and music for “Into 
the Heights” and “Hamilton,” 
Miranda’s 
artistry 
displays 

dimension. While doing many 
things, each aspect of his holds 
immense value.

Sometimes in the process of 

taking on too much, we wear 
ourselves thin and the value of 
each part starts to dwindle. In this 
way, we become beings who do a 
lot of things, but each at a subpar 
level — not the best or even close to 
the best. 

We’ve become a people who 

have to acquire more than one 
skill to prove we can do the thing 
we claim to know best, the best. In 
this process, we learn it requires a 
willingness for each of us to jump 

into anything for the sake of gaining 
deeper knowledge towards what 
originally provoked our passion.

There is a distinction worth 

making between what exists as a 
choice and what we force ourselves 
to do to become more dynamic. 
Sometimes one path leads to 
another and you may discover 
that your interest in singing may 
lead to an interest in playing an 
instrument. Either way, there is 
a choice whether to divert or not 
from familiarity. The expectation 
has already been set. Our culture is 
just waiting for us to reach it.

As students, we see this type of 

thinking play out in almost anything 
— careers, jobs, internships — we 
want to offer more than the person 
next to us and it is vital towards 
developing our craft.

Agent Leslie Barany writes in 

a letter to aspiring artists: “Stop 
aspiring and start doing. This will 
keep you very busy but it can’t be 
helped. In my opinion, this is how 
you might, possibly, have a shot at 
becoming a good artist.”

We have to be motivated to 

know a lot about what surrounds 
us in our artistry, the fields outside 
of our specific studies and even the 
people around us who are different 
than ourselves.

To become a well-rounded 

individual, we have to start doing. 
Greatness is not purely expertise 
in one area, but it is appreciation 
and knowledge of everything 
surrounding it. In this, you can 
tap into a new level of richness and 
beauty towards what you already 
know and love — offering more to 
your pursuit while understanding 
all that surrounds it.

Fashion in the time of President-elect Donald Trump: 
the politics of dress and identity in today’s day and age

The role of the fashion industry in our national political discourse

On Nov. 18, women’s clothing 

designer Sophie Theallet released 
an open letter on her Instagram 
denouncing 
Melania 
Trump, 

the future first lady. Theallat, 
who designed many of first lady 
Michelle 
Obama’s 
stunning 

gowns 
throughout 
President 

Barack Obama’s administration, 
wrote that President-elect Trump 
campaign’s values and actions did 
not align with those of her brand.

In addition to Theallat’s letter 

about Melania, attention to Ivanka 
Trump’s 
own 
collection 
has 

increased. Some claim her brand, 
which promotes strong women in 
the workplace, is contradictory to 
the words and actions of her father, 

the President-elect. In response 
to this, a California-originated 
campaign 
#GrabYourWallet 
is 

urging 
customers 
to 
boycott 

Trump 
brands, 
as 
well 
as 

pressuring retailers to remove the 
brands from their shelves. Over 
200 million people have tweeted 
with the hashtag, and Shoes.com 
and Bellacor have both dropped 
the Trump name from their 
merchandise.

These 
recent 
happenings 

represent 
the 
much 
larger 

sentiment of the fashion industry 
throughout this past election. 
Much of the fashion industry, 
including Vogue Editor-in-Chief 
Anna 
Wintour 
and 
designer 

Diane von Furstenberg, supported 
Clinton and fought for her win. 
With Donald Trump taking office 
soon, fashion’s relationship with 

politics just got that much more 
interesting.

Upon 
reading 
about 
these 

new forms of protest, I began to 
wonder about the relationship 
fashion should hold to politics. 
Theallat 
herself 
noted 
that 

involving her brand with the 
recent election may not be a smart 
move business-wise. However, 
she also noted that it was a 
family business and she wanted 
to promote what she believed 
was the right thing. But patrons 
of fashion pushed back, arguing 
that style and politics should not 
intermingle and remain separate 
in their individual worlds.

Why shouldn’t brands, and 

designers, 
take 
a 
stance 
on 

these issues? Furthermore, as 
consumers, how do we continue 
to connect style with candidates 

with whom we don’t necessarily 
agree? Does an opinion, popular or 
unpopular, control our willingness 
to buy from that brand?

Frankly, it is not uncommon 

for brands to take a stance in 
current 
affairs, 
and 
fashion 

almost always plays a role in 
any overtly-public phenomena. 
We cannot pretend that the two 
worlds do not coexist, and that 
the everyday brands we touch 
and care about don’t influence 
us immensely. First ladies have 
often been under the scrutiny 
of the public and media: Jackie 
Kennedy, Hillary Clinton and 
Michelle Obama have all drawn 
attention as fashion symbols of 
their times. Furthermore, people 
relate certain styles to politics, 
such as the pantsuit that has been 
synonymous with Hillary Clinton.
