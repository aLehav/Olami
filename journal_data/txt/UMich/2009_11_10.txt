No leads in fire investiga tio

Fire chief: AAFD is
* waiting on AAPD to
move forward
By DARRYN FITZGERALD
Daily StaffReporter
The Ann Arbor Fire Depart-
ment has yet to determine any

leads in the investigation of a fire
that engulfed an abandoned build-
ing on South University Avenue,
more than two weeks ago.
Although fire department offi-
cials have ruled out natural causes
for the blaze that devastated the
former location of Pinball Pete's,
investigators have not identified
any suspects.
"We are waiting to see if the

police detectives come up with
something that would be appli-
cable for us to follow up on," Fire
Marshal Kathleen Chamberlain
said.
There is no new information
regarding whether the fire was
started intentionally.
Chamberlain told the Daily
that the Ann Arbor Fire Depart-
ment and Police Detective's Unit

are cooperative agencies, but.
work independently with regard
to these types of investigations.
"We're following up on what-
ever leads (the detectives unit)
has," Chamberlain said. "Some-
times there isn't much to follow
up on - that's why so many fires
are undetermined."

Martin apologized
for incidents at
Notre Dame,
Delaware St. games
By JILLIAN BERMAN
Daily News Editor
University Athletic Director Bill
Martin apologized yesterday for
allegedly assaulting two students
who work for the Department
of Public Safety at home football
games on two separate occasions.
At the Michigan football games
against Notre Dame and Delaware
State, Martin allegedly made phys-
ical contact with the DPS staff-
ers after he was initially denied
entry into the Regents Guest Area,
according to a DPS incident report.
In a statement released late yes-
terday, Martin said that confusion
over changes in DPS protocol was
to blame for the incident and that
he had apologized to the two staff-
ers for his behavior.
"It was a frustrating situation,
and one I should have handled
differently," Martin wrote in the
statement.
The two victims will not be
pressing charges and DPS has
closed the file, according to Uni-
versity spokeswoman Kelly Cun-
ningham.
The first incident occurred atthe
Notre Dame game on Sept. 12. LSA
sophomore Jackie Turner told DPS

she was assigned to work the north
stairwell of the Regents Guest Area
to make sure only patrons with a
Regents Area wristband gained
entry to the area.
Just before halftime, Turner
was in charge of opening doors to
let patrons out of the area when
three males wearing University of
Michigan polo shirts attempted to
come through the doors, according
to the report.
Turner told DPS she stepped in
front of the doorway and told the
man in the front of the group that
she needed to see his pass to let
him in. in response, the man, Mar-
tin, put his hand on her shoulder
and said "Honey, I'm the athletic
director," pushing her just enough
so she would get out of his way.
According to the report, Turner
decided to report the incident after
she heard fellow employees talking
about a similar incident at the Oct.
17 game against Delaware State.
Arif Kahn, an Eastern Michi-
gan student and DPS employee,
told DPS he was assigned to work
the south stairwell of the Regents
Guest Area during the Delaware
State game.
Shortly after the game ended, a
man and woman, both elderly, tried
to enter the area and walked past
him "as if he wasn't there," accord-
ing to the report. Kahn said he put
his hand on the door and asked to
see their passes. In response, the
man "forcibly grabbed" Kahn's
windbreaker and pushed him

The Broadway of Ann Arbor

The Mendelssohn The-
atre, tucked away in the
hack of the second flour
of the Michigan League,
opened in May 1929
with the opening of the
League, according to the
theatre's website.
Throughout its exis-
tence the theatre has
played host to shows that
later went on to be per-
formed on Broadway.
The theatre gets its
name from Lydia Men-
delssohn, the mother of
Gordon ,Mendelssohn,
who donated $50,000 to
erect the theatre.
During the Great
Depression, the Univer-
sity's Women's League,
which was responsible for
the upkeep of the build-

log and the theatre, went
bankrupt and the Univer-
sity took over operation
of the theatre, according
to Barry LaRue, senior
performance halls opera-
tions manager for Univer-
sity Produsctions.
LaRue said though
there are many theatres
on campus, the Men-
delssohn has a unique
character.
"Various theatres that
we have represent a wide
variety of architectural
styles that allow people to
choose the right venue,"
he said. "(But) some
things just fit in Men-

Today, the theatre is
used for academic events,
as well as theatrical

performances from the
School of Music, Theatre
& Dance and Ann Arbor
Civic Theater, according
to Jeffrey Kuras, direc-
tor of University Produc-
tions.
Kuras said when he's
been a part ofperform anc-

"People refer to the

Senate debates
abortion coverage
Abortion opponents in the Senate
are seeking tough restrictions in the
health care overhaul bill, a move that
could roil a shaky Democratic effort
to pass President Barack Obama's
signature issue by year's end.
Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., said
Monday it's unlikely he could sup-
port abill that doesn't clearly prohibit
federal dollars from going to pay for
abortions. His spokesman said Nel-
son is weighing options, including
" offering an amendment that's similar
to the one passed by the House.
The House-passed restrictions
were the price Speaker Nancy Pelosi,
D-Calif., had to pay to get a health
care bill passed, on a narrow 220-
215 vote. But it's prompted an angry
backlash fromliberals,some ofwhom
are now threatening to vote against a
final bill if the curbs stay in.
Senate Democrats will need Nel-
son's vote - and those of other abor-
tion opponents in their caucus - to
prevail in what's likely to be a gruel-
ing debate against Republicans who
are unified in their opposition.

Radical imam

A radical American imam on
Yemen's most wanted militant list
who had contact with two 9/11hijack-
ers praised alleged Fort Hood shooter
Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan as a hero on
his personal Web site yesterday.
The posting on the Web site for
Anwar al Awlaki, who was a spiri-
tual leader at two mosques where
* three 9/11 hijackers worshipped,
said American Muslims who con-
demned the attacks on the Texas
military base last week are hypo-
crites who have committed treason
against their religion.
Awlaki said the only way a Mus-
lim can justify serving in the U.S.
military is if he intends to "follow
in the footsteps of men like Nidal."
"Nidal Hassan (sic) is a hero. He
is a man of conscience who could
not bear living the contradiction
of being a Muslim and serving in
an army that is fighting against his
own~y ," Awlaki wrote.

Drug treatment: Is

States look to
change war on drugs
by expanding
rehab programs
NEW YORK (AP) - Based on the
rhetoric, America's war on drugs
seems poised to shift into a more
enlightened phase where treatment
of addicts gains favor over impris-
onment of low-level offenders.
Questions abound, however, about
the nation's readiness to turn the
talk into reality.
The economic case for expand-
ing treatment, especially amid
a recession, seems clear. Study
after study concludes that treat-
ing addicts, even in lengthy resi-
dential programs, costs markedly
less than incarcerating them, so
budget-strapped states could save
millions.
The unmet need for more treat-
ment also is vast. According to fed-
eral data, 7.6 million Americans
needed treatment for illicit drug
use in 2008, and only 1.2 million -
or 16 percent - received it.
But the prospect of savings on
prison and court costs hasn't pro-
duced a surge of new fiscal support
for treatment. California's latest
crisis budget, for example, strips all
but a small fraction of state funding
away from a successful diversion
and treatment program that voters
approved in 2000.
"It's easy to talk a good game
about more treatment and helping
people," said Scott Burns, execu-
tive director of the National Dis-
trict Attorneys Association. "But it
smashes head on into reality when
they don't put their money where
their mouth is."
Money aside, the treatment field
faces multiple challenges. At many
programs, counselors - often for-
mer addicts themselves - are low-
paid and turnover is high. Many
states have yet to impose effective
systems for evaluating programs, a
crucial issue in a field where success
is relative and relapses inevitable.
"Fifty percent of clients who
enter treatment complete it suc-
cessfully - that means we're losing
half," said Raquel Jeffers, director
of New Jersey's Division of Addic-
tion Services. "We can do better."
The appointment of treatment
expert Tom McLellan as deputy
director of the White House Office
of National Drug Control Policy in
April was seen as part of a shift of
priorities for the drug czar's office.

McLellan said he sees greater
openness to expanding treatment
but also deep misunderstanding or
ignorance about scientific advances
in the field and the need to integrate
it into the health care system.
Most Americans, he suggested,
have an image of drug treatment
formed from the movies - "car-
toon treatment" involving emo-
tional group encounters - and are
unaware of a new wave of medi-
cations and other therapies that
haven't gained wide use despite
proven effectiveness
"For the first time, it can truly
be said that we know what to do -
we know the things that work," he
said. "But do we have the economic
and political willingness to put
them into place? If we do, we'll see
results."
McLellan, insisting he's not "a
wild-eyed liberal," said expanding
treatment wouldn't negate the war
on drugs.
"Law enforcement is necessary,
but it's not sufficient," he said. "You
need effective preventive services,
addiction and mental health ser-
vices integrated with the rest of
medicine. You shouldn't have to go
to some squalid little place across
the railroad tracks."
By federal count, there are more
than 13,640 treatment programs
nationwide, ranging from world-
class to dubious and mostly oper-
ating apart from the mainstream
health-care industry.
Dr. H. Westley Clark, director
of the federal Center for Substance
Abuse Treatment, said his agency
wants states to develop better mea-
surements of programs' perfor-
mance.
"The data shows treatment saves
money - $1 spent to $4 or $7 saved,"
Clark said. "If you're an altruist,
making treatment available is a
good thing. If you're a narcissist,
it's a good thing - you'd pay less in
taxes."
Treatment advocates are closely
watching Congress, hoping the
pending health care overhaul will
expand insurance coverage for sub-
stance abuse programs. Recent fed-
eral dataindicatesthat37percentof
those seeking treatment don't get it
because they can't pay for it - and
many land in prison.
The work force in drug treat-
ment is, for the most part, modestly
paid, with counselors often earning
less than the $40,000 per year that
it costs to keep an inmate in prison
in many states.
"Some of the stigma that goes
with addiction adheres to the staff

as well," Jeffers said. "Most agen-
cies are trying to do right - but the
field is getting increasingly compli-
cated. The business skills that are
needed aren't always the same skills
that make a good clinician."
Yet generally, front-line coun-
selors win high praise - especially
the ex-addicts who bring savvy and
credibility to the job.
"People in the field weren't driv-
en to it by the money or glamour, but
often by personal experience or that
of a loved one," said Keith Hum-
phreys, a treatment expert from
Stanford University now working
for the drug czar's office. "They
may not have the fanciest degrees,
but they are incredibly caring."
Garnett Wilson served prison
time for armed robbery in the 1980s
and now - at 61 - has two decades
of drug counseling under his belt as
a valued employee of the Fortune
Society, which provides support
services to ex-offenders in New
York City.
As he cajoles the men in his
groups, he strives to remember his
own battle to change.
"Some of the people who've
been through it become too rigid,"
he said. "Preaching doesn't work.
They forget how hard it is to rise
above your environment, and they
alienate the people they're trying
to help."
Wilson says he focuses his efforts
on "those guys that are ready."
Perhaps Joe Smith is one of
them.
A 29-year-old from Brooklyn,
Smith recently served eight months
in prison for a weapons offense and
was a heavy marijuana user, but
now - studying and job-hunting -
says he's determined to go straight.
"It's been kind of tough," he said.
"The hardest part is just to come
to it every day, but when you come
to think about it, it's not so hard
- because if you don't, it's back to
jail."
Another client, Ronnie Johnson,
has been back in New York City
barely a month after more than a
decade in prison upstate.
"It's like family -here --every-
body's supportive," said Johnson,
39, contrasting the Fortune Society
staff with drug treatment workers
in prison who were "just doing it for
a paycheck."
In the years ahead, New York may
serve as a test case for the potential
to expand treatment programs.
Earlier this year, its legislature
approved sweeping reforms of
harsh drug laws enacted in 1973
under Gov. Nelson Rockefeller.

NY governor
vows to legalize
same-sex marriage
by year's end
ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov.
David Paterson yesterday urged
lawmakers to legalize same-sex
marriage in New York, calling it
"an issue that touches on the very
core of our citizenship."
His request raises the hopes
of gay advocates who suffered a
major defeat in Maine when vot-
ers repealed that state's same-sex-
marriage law last week.
In New York City, Christine
Quinn, the openly gay council
speaker, quickly weighed in by
offering an impassioned plea for
the state Senate to pass a bill legal-
izingsame-sex marriage.
In a rare midyear address to a
joint session of the Legislature,
the Democrat singled out his gay
marriage proposal in a lengthy
agenda for today's extraordinary
session that will mostly be devot-
ed to addressing the state's $3.2
billion budget deficit.
"It is an issue that in many
ways speaks to the very founda-
tion of our democracy," Paterson
said of gay marriage. "I would like
it addressed as immediately as
possible, because justice delayed
is justice denied. I am asking the
members of the New York state
Senate on both sides of the aisles
to take up and pass the marriage
equality legislation this week."
It was the only time his 15-min-
ute address was interrupted by
applause, but it was only a smat-
tering, with perhaps half the leg-

islators refusing to clap.
However, in a signal that usu-
ally indicates progress in negotia-
tions in Albany, Paterson changed
his time frame for adoption from
Tuesday, the only day so far
he called the Legislature into
extraordinary session, to some-
time this week.
Then Paterson made a personal
plea, following his framing of the
issue a year ago asa civil right, and
his recent promise to have the bill
passed and signed into law by the
end of the year.
The Rev. Jason McGuire of
New Yorkers for Constitutional
Freedoms said Tuesday's results
in Maine have shown even mod-
erate Republicans that they can't
afford to back the measure going
into the 2010 elections. He said
the group is confident they have
35 or 36 senators opposed to the
measure, which would block pas-
sage in the 62-seat house.
"God established marriage and
I don't think the state has a right
to redefine it," McGuire said. But
he said the concern is really about
children, who need to learn from
mothers and fathers.
"Marriage is never about two
people. It's about future gen-
erations," he said. "It does affect
what's good for society as a
whole."
Already passed in the Demo-
crat-led Assembly, the measure
wasn't brought to the floor in
the spring because there weren't
enough votes in the 32-30 Demo-
cratic majority to pass it. A few
Democrats opposed the bill on
religious grounds. Paterson
changed that by putting the bill in
his proclamation for yesterday's
extraordinary session.

Excelling online
Cost of copy shops can be offset by online course materials
At several hundred dollars per semester, the cost of course
materials can be a sizable burden for many students. For
students who purchase coursepacks from Excel Test
Preparation, that burden might get a bit heavier. Last week, a
federal district court ruled that Excel was violating copyright
laws by not paying fees to publishers. And while there is a valid
need to clear up the legal issues surrounding copyright laws that
affect students, infringing upon students' access to knowledge
is problematic. This ruling underscores the need for copyright
laws to be friendly to students in the education process, but more
importantly should serve as a reminder for professors to make
more of their course materials available online.

Federal District Court Judge Avern Cohn
issued a statement Nov. 2 sidingwith several
publishers alleging that Excel had commit-
ted copyright infringement. In June 2007,
Blackwell Publishing, Elsevier, Oxford Uni-
versity Press, SAGE Publications and John
Wiley & Sons filed suit against Excel and
claimed the company had committed copy-
right infringement on 33 documents. Excel
was targeted because, unlike other copy
shops in Ann Arbor, it wasn't paying fees
to publishers. Excel owner Norman Mill-
er claimed that since students copied the
information for their own personal use, the
company wasn't violating copyright laws.
But the federal district court disagreed,
ruling last week that copyrighted materials
were being sold for profit and without pay-
ment of appropriate fees.
Excel's practice of not paying the pub-
lishing fees may seem questionable, espe-
cially considering that the company was
in competition with local businesses that
were following the letter of the law and
paying the fees. But opaque copyright laws
that fail to clarify what is or is not "fair use"
for college students are at least partly to
blame. These laws need clarification so that
all copy shops can follow clear, consistent
regulations.
But in formulating a consistent legal defi-

nition, it should be taken into account that
Excel was able to offer its services at half
the price of other Ann Arbor copy shops
because it didn't pay publishing fees - pro-
viding cheaper coursepacks for students.
Making course materials less expensive is
important. When course materials are too
expensive, some students have no choice
but to not of buy them and suffer the conse-
quences. Copy businesses need tobe able to
provide materials to students at a low cost,
and if copyright laws prevent this from
happening, it might be the laws that need
to change.
Luckily, many professors are aware of
this, and already post their required read-
ing materials online for students. Moving
academic materials online is an important
trend that should become the norm for Uni-
versity classes whenever possible. Online
access to course'materials can negate some
of the costs associated with buying and
printing texts, and gives students more
options. It also makes knowledge more
widely available through the Internet.
But students in many classes will con-
tinue to need access to hard copies of their
materials. For this reason, copy shops
will continue to serve a vital purpose and
require laws that understand the services
they offer to college students.

Buried in the news this past
week was a story that NASA
had announced a winner in
its Power Beaming
Challenge, a com- -
petition aimed at
rewarding innova-
tive designs that
may lead toward
a new meansaof
getting to space:
using an eleva-
tor. A space eleva-
tor is just one of BEN
dozens of projects CALECA
rattling around
in the brains of
futurists that has
not only the power to inspire people,
but also the potential to change the
way people live in general. If our
species hopes to make the world a
better place, it is essential that orga-
nizations such as NASA continue to
encourage research into expansive
projects for the betterment of our
civilization.
The space elevator is a perfect
example of a massive engineering
undertaking to open up access to
space by making space travel afford-
able. The concept was the brainchild
of author Arthur Clarke as an eco-
nomical means of getting into space.
A cable over 20,000 kilometers long
is placed between a floating offshore
platform on a body of water and a
space station that orbits the Earth
at the same rate as the offshore plat-
form is moving. An elevator car could
move payloads between the two ends
of the cable at only a fraction of the
cost of current orbital rocket tech-
nologies. What's holding the concept
back is current technology. Materials
strong enough for such a cable don't
yet exist outside of laboratories, and a
vehicle that can move up such a cable
isn't like anything ever before built.
The NASA competition aims at help-
ing to solve this second dilemma.
There are of course, many other
avenues for researching massive

scale projects. International Ther-
monuclear Experimental Reactor is a
fusion reactor project in France that
could, in theory, solve our clean ener-
gy concerns for good through the use
of a fusion reactor, that mimics the
sun's internal energyprocesses. A cell
biologist at the Mount Sinai School
of Medicine in New York last week
published a proposal to artificially
fertilize great deserts in Africa and
Australia. That would create a new
ecosystem that would absorb more
carbon dioxide than man produces
per year, effectively removing man's
contribution to global warming. Oth-
ers have proposed solar screens the
size of countries that would decrease
the total sunlight sent to Earth.
But these kinds of projects require
billions upon billions of dollars -
perhaps even trillions - and would
require alevel ofcooperationbetween
countries that seems unachievable
today. Without the ambition to try for
such lofty goals, there is less incen-
tive for quantum leaps in innova-
tion. The exponential rate of growth
of technology should be motivation
enough for ever bigger projects, and
if people are given just a little push to
reach for lofty goals, innovators come
out of the woodwork.
The most recent noteworthy exam-
ple was the Ansari X-Prize, a private
group that awarded $10 million to
the first team to reach space with a
privately financed and built space-
craft. The group's intention was to
spark entrepreneurship and innova-
tion to jumpstart space exploration.
Within just a few years, engineer
Burt Rutan's team, Scaled Com-
posites, created what they dubbed
SpaceShipOne. The team nwb*'has a
budding space tourism venture that
uses an upgraded version of Rutan's
prize-winning design. Many other
proposals for space hotels and space-
planes have popped up since then.
To say that there isn't excitement
over pie in the sky goals is just plain
wrong - there's no greater way to get

engineers and scientists to use their
talents to their fullest or for govern-
ments to cooperate better than to
give them dreams.
What if these kind of endeavors
fail? A project like the space elevator
or massive geoengineering projects
aimed at changing the very climate
of Earth are perhaps too difficult for
our generation to realize. Perhaps
we're fating ourselves to Daedelus'
folly by aspiring to such grand ideas.
The same thing that happens when
other scientific initiatives fail - the
thousands of hours of work, the mate-
rials developed and tested and the
small innovations designed to work
around problems in a larger picture
all find their way into our lives in
ways their creators never intended.
Even if we can't build a cable strong
enough to hold a space elevator, we
might design one strong enough to
make safer, stronger and more effi-
cient bridges.
Big investments
in technology
will pay off.
By financing and encouraging
research into ambitious projects,
organizations both public and pri-
vate that encourage innovation are a
benefit to society as a whole. Orga-
nizations like NASA and the Ansari
X-Prize encourage the first steps
toward research in fields that indi-
viduald miight otherwise not attempt
to tackle on their own. More than
making a massive project possible,
they give more avenues for intended
and unintended advancements in
beneficial technology.

Foreign fallacy

Pictures of alien anatomy: guaranteed crowd-pleasers

'V' crashes to Earth

New ABC sci-fi series
can't live up to the drama
of its promo clips
By JAMIE BLOCK
SeniorArts Editor
There's a vendetta to be had against
ABC's new sci-fi drama
"V." Promos promised * *'
intrigue, mystery, sub-
version,. an expert cast, V
stunning visuals and the
epic tale of a stalwart few Tuesdays
rising against the blindly at 8 p.m.
devoted masses. As for ABC
keeping those promises
... well, at least "V' lookedpretty in the
previews.
"V" follows the visitors, a race of reptil-
ian aliens who wear the skin of beautiful
people, as they come to aid and/or destroy
humanity. And from the high frequency
of none-too-subtle knowing looks from
visitor High Commander, Anna (Morena
Baccarin, "Firefly"), destroy seems to be
a good bet. Heading the anti-visitor resis-
tance is Georgie Sutton (David Richmond-
Peck, "Robson Arms"), a slightly irritating
little fellow whose picture should appear
next to the dictionary definition of
"snarky." Joining him in the fight are
FBI agent Erica Evans (Elizabeth Mitch-
ell, "Lost") and Father Jack Landry (Joel
Gretsch, "The 4400"). The show is a re-
interpretation of a 1980s show with the

same nane and same aliens, bringing the
story into the 21st century.
The cast is brimming with sci-fi and
supernatural veterans from such TV sta-
ples as "Lost," "The 4400" and "Firefly."
These actors all do a great job with what
they're given, but the writing is often so
stale and predictable that no amount of
acting aptitude could make their roles
truly shine. That said, the veteran actors
do all manage to at least counterbalance
the writing, bringing their scenes to a
moderately happy medium.
But then there are the other cast mem-
bers. Morris Chestnut (Film's "The Perfect
Holiday") hides his character Ryan Nich-
ols's inner struggle about as well as a palm
tree hides an elephant, and his fake smile
is so appalling - as well as legitimately
terrifying in its largeness and whiteness
that it physically hurts the eyes and brain
to behold. Other mediocre-at-best acting
jobs are performed by Logan Huffman
("America"), who plays Erica's son Tyler,
and relative newcomer Jesse Wheeler as
Tyler's best friend Brandon. It shouldn't
be that hard for angsty teens to act like
angsty teens - but apparently it is.
It's bad enough that line delivery from
some cast members sounds straight out of
a first read-through, but the writers had to
make the dialogue exceedingly predictable
as well. It wasn't difficult to predict the
next three lines verbatim in most scenes,
taking away all the impact the more pro-
found statements were intended to have.
And this predictability was not unique
to the lines themselves - it infected the

pilot's plot as well. With perhaps one
exception, there were no major twists or
turns. Considering "V" is a remake, there
must certainly be some adherence to the
framework of the original, but the updated
version has no excuse to lull onward so
formulaically. Many scenes feel far too
drawn out specifically because it's clear
exactly where the intended suspense is
heading. And when you know something
potentially epic is going to happen, you
want the show to hurry up and get there.
So yes, finally it must be noted that some
very epic stuff does happen in "V" Maybe
only half the cast really shines, maybe the
dialogue is stilted and predictable and
maybe the plot follows a well-worn formu-
la - that can all be glanced over (mostly)
when one considers the show's undeniable
cool. The spaceships and other alien tech-
nologies are breathtakingly portrayed,
even on a small screen. The clean, mod-
ern, peaceful-yet-evil vibe of the visitors,
is executed flawlessly; they are every sci-fi
junkie's fantasy. And "V" succeeds where
ABC's other new supernatural endeavor
"FlashForward" has been recently failing:
The epic nature of the visitors' arrival and
impact on humanity is not diminished by
the show's focus on a select few characters.
When a classic sci-fi premise meets
great sci-fi actors, you ought to get a must-
see sci-fi show. Instead, predictable and
stale writing has brought a promising
premise down from orbit and crashed it
into Earth. And while the explosion may
be entertaining for a while, we've all seen
explosions before.

magine, if you will, a multiplex.
You and your friends are scanning
the marquee looking for a good
time. Listed among the films playing
are the historical -
action epic "Hero,"
the vampire fright-
ener "Let the Right
One In" and the"
quirky, unconven-
tional romantic com-
edy "Love Me If You ANDEW
Dare." If you or your L
friends tend to flock
toward any of these genres of movies,
perhaps you'd enjoy trying one of these.
Except the ticket-taker has informed
you that all three movies are "foreign
films," and your first impression of a
"foreign film" is three hours of a Swed-
ish family sitting around a dinner table
talking about their feelings. You decide
to pass on these risky ventures and go
see something mediocre instead. It
may not be the best movie you could've
chosen, but at least everyone talks in
English, right?
There is a continued insistence in the
movie industry to lump all international
movies into a single genre known as
"foreign," and this mindset has got to go.
It's a nonsensical, outdated and in many
ways xenophobic concept, as though a
film not made by Americans isn't wor-
thy of sharing their categorizations.
"Foreign films" can still be dramas,
comedies, fantasies or family-friendly,
but you'd never know because they're all
stuffed into art-house cinemas and the
same corner of the video store.
The word "foreign" in itself is mis-
leading because it implies impenetrabil-
ity; as in, the experience of viewing such
a movie would surely alienate you. But
film is supposed to be a universal lan-
guage, right? You don't need a degree in
Spanish tobe terrified bythe Pale Man
character in "Pan's Labyrinth." Movies
are visual by definition, and our level
of understanding shouldn't depend on
whether or not those visuals were cre-
ated in our country.
But let's assume that "foreign" is an
acceptable way to categorize a film's
genre. Now, what makes a foreign film?
According to the Motion Picture Acad-
emy's rules for eligibility into the Best
Foreign-Language Film Category, over
half of the dialogue must be spoken in a
language other than English. So what of
this summer's "Inglourious Basterds,"
in which more dialogue is spoken in
foreign languages (French, German and
Italian) than in English?
Well, maybe that's OK because the
director, Quentin Tarantino, is Ameri-
can. We wouldn't want to limit the
audience for an American director's
movie just because not every line of dia-
logue is in English ... unless that Ameri-
can director is Julian Schnabel and the
film is the all-French "The Diving Bell
and the Butterfly" - it was classified as
foreign.
And then there's the strange, sad

case of the Israeli drama "The Band's
Visit," which has the dubious distinc-
tion of being labeled as both "foreign"
and "not foreign enough." The film
has spoken dialogue in English, Arabic
and Hebrew, and was submitted for
consideration in the 2007 Best Foreign-
Language Film category but deemed
ineligible because over half of the
dialogue was spoken in English. But
because it's so hard to tell which tongue
is spoken more in the movie, the Acad-
emy determined this by counting each
individual word. So despite the fact that
the film was made in a different country
by non-Americans, it was separated
from other great, arbitrarily "foreign"
films by a handful of English words.
And as those who have seen "The
Band's Visit" know, the English is
spoken in order to bridge the com-
munication gap between the Egyptian
characters and the Israeli characters.
The film was punished for trying to
impart a message about cross-cultural
understanding.
Look, it's fine for a movie to embrace
its own cultural heritage. In fact, that
should be encouraged. But it's not fine
for us to define a movie strictly by its cul-
tdral heritage. A kung-fu crowd pleaser
by Yimou Zhang ("House of Flying
Daggers") evokes the legends of ancient
China by design, so we can say it's a Chi-
What's in a
language?
nese film. But we shouldn't file it next to
Roberto Benigni's "Life Is Beautiful" at
Borders and pretend the two are similar
enoughtobe grouped together.
The Ann Arbor District Library has
just about the best filing system I've
seen when it comes to distinguishing
international cinema. It has a "foreign
language" section, but the movies are
grouped according to their country of .
origin. Which makes sense, inasmuch
as those who liked "The Band's Visit"
will be more likely to stumble on the
also-excellent Israeli film "Waltz With
Bashir." But this system is still flawed.
How, for example, could you ever hope
to discover Ousmane Sembene's "Moo-
laad6" unless you were already looking
for a movie from the African nation
Burkina Faso?
There's a new movie called "The
Baader Meinhof Complex" opening at
the Michigan Theater this weekend.
It's a historical political drama about
a'70s-era German terrorist group that
has been getting rave reviews. It's also
spoken in German. I haven't seen it yet,
but I plan to. If you see the movie, don't
think of it as a "foreign film." Think of
it as a film.

& Reality

In voting for Barack
Obama on November 4,
2008, millions of people
sought a change from the
previous eight years of the
Bush administration. One
year later, a balance sheet
can be drawn.
Far from "change,"
Obama is deepening the
right-wing policies of his
predecessor-including
handing out trillions of

dollars to bail out the
banks; expanding war in
Afghanistan and Pakistan,
continuing the occupation
of Iraq and issuing new
threats against Iran; and
pushing through a health
care overhaul aimed at
cutting costs and care for
millions of Americans.
While the bankers who
created the crisis are now
doing better than ever,

the social crisis affecting
masses of people is getting
worse, as unemployment
soars and wages fall.
These public meetings
will present a detailed
analysis of the policies of
the Obama administration
and will explain the
basis for an independent
socialist movement of
the international working
class.

From Page 1
exhausted its own investigation
and is now waiting on new evi-
dence from the detective unit.
As of 6 p.m. yesterday night,
the Ann Arbor Police Department
Detective's Bureau had not returned
the Daily's phone calls regarding the
current status of its investigation.
If the detectives don't obtain any
leads, the cause of the fire will be
ruled undetermined, but the case
will remain open.
"Undetermined fires are never
really closed out," Chamberlain
LECTURE
From Page 1

said. "You never know when some-
one might come forward."
Chamberlain explained that in
the event that an arson case goes
undetermined, it will remain that
way until a witness or suspect
brings forth new evidence.
"Arsons are usually built on cir-
cumstantial evidence rather than
direct evidence," Chamberlain
told the Daily. "They're very diffi-
cult. We process what we have and
are waiting to see if anything new
comes up."
Chamberlain urged witnesses to
call the fire department or police
detectives unit with any additional
information they have aboutthe fire.

Tuesday, November)10, 2009 - 7
Chamberlain was quoted in an
earlier Daily article saying that fire
officials determined the blaze start-
ed on a corner of an upper floor of
the building, and very quickly had
spread through the entire structure.
Neighboring buildings including
the apartment complex University
Towers and Momo Tea sustained
minor damage as a result of the fire.
Momo Tea reopened on Friday
after damage to its kitchen forced
the business to close for some time.
University Towers was evacu-
ated during the fire for safety pur-
poses,butthe 600 displacedtenants
were allowed back intotheir homes
within a few horns

WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Army psychiatrist accused of the
Fort Hood massacre is believed to
have acted alone despite repeated
communications - monitored by
authorities - with a radical imam
overseas, U.S. officials said yester-
day. The FBI will conduct an inter-
nal review of its handling of the
information, they said.
An investigative official and a
Republican lawmaker said Maj.
Nidal Malik Hasan was in contact
with Anwar al-Awlaki, an imam
released from a Yemeni jail last
year, 10 to 20 times. Despite that,

Green, began opening statements
mid-morning by painting McGee
as a hard-working man dedicated
to furthering his education.
McGee, who holds both bache-
lor's and master's degrees from the
University, worked as a radiation
safety officer at Ford Motor Com-
pany before returning to the Uni-
versity full-time in August 2004 to
study neutron radiology. To further
his quest to become a professor,
McGee became a pre-candidate for
" the Ph.D. program.
Hartman began his assistant
professorship in fall 2007, the same
year he hired McGee. McGee was
assigned to complete the security
systems for a neutron generator in
the Naval Architecture and Marine
Engineering Building on North
Campus.
Green said McGee began to
question Hartman's care for safety
when he began setting safety sys-
tem deadlines so early they couldn't
be completed in time. Hartman
would also occasionally bring his
son, a minor at the time, into the
lab to assist him, an act McGee
thought was unsafe.
Hartman caused a problem with
the laboratory's neutron generator
when he fired it up while McGee
was out of town on Nov. 6, 2007.
Green said that after the incident
McGee expressed his concerns to
two nuclear engineering and radio-
logical sciences professors, James
Holloway and John Lee.
Green said McGee observed

Hartman and another graduate
student pouring unknown chemi-
cals down the drain of a recently
installed stainless steel sink on
Feb.16, 2008. McGee had concerns
about the chemicals going down
the drain becyuse he believed it

cuss the case. Republican Rep.
Pete Hoekstra of Michigan, the
top Republican on the House
Intelligence Committee, said it
was his understanding Hasan
and the imam exchanged e-mails
that counterterrorism officials
picked up.
Hasan, awake and talking to
doctors, met his lawyer yesterday
in the Texas hospital where he
is recovering under guard from
gunshot wounds in the rampage
Thursday that left 13 people dead
and 29 injured. Officials said he
will be tried in a military court, not
a civilian one.
FBI Director Robert Mueller has
ordered an internal inquiry to see
University spokeswoman, Kelly
Cunningham, wrote in an e-mail
statement that the incident was
the result of confusion over a new
security policy and that DPS has
closed the file.
"There was a situation at the
stadium involving two University
employees and Athletic Director
Bill Martin," she wrote. "The
employees were part of a new
security process for the stadium's
guest areas and they (one each,
on two separate occasions) did
not initially allow Martin - who
was unaware of the new proce-
dure - to enter. The change caused

Based on all the investiga-
tions since the attack, including a
review of that 2008 information,
the investigators said they have
no evidence that Hasan had help
or outside orders in the shoot-
ings.

unnecessary confusion and we are
working to improve the process for
future games. The employees were
satisfied with the follow up and the
matter has been resolved."
In the statement released yester-
day, Martin said that he had apolo-
gized to the two employees for the
incidents.
"I have communicated with
both employees to discuss the situ-
ation and express my regret," Mar-
tin wrote. "They were just doing
their jobs."
On Oct. 21, Martin announced
he would step down as athletic
director effective Sept. 4, 2010.

"It's a time set aside for thinking
about academic and intellectual free-
dom, (which are) core values for our
campus and our education," she said.
Hamburger who specializes in
constitutional law and its history,
based yesterday's lecture on his
extensive study of First, Amend-
ment rights and censorship. ?r
Hamburger said there has been
a dramatic shift toward censorship
of scholarly work in the 21st centu-
ry. He said while Americans think
their freedoms of speech and press
are protected by the First Amend-
ment, this is not the case.
"But faculty and students,
including faculty and students right
here in Michigan, no longer have
the ability to control this freedom
because of the revival of the licens-
ing of speech and the press," Ham-
burger said.
Hamburger said the United
States is moving toward drastic
policies of press and speech censor-

the 17th century, during Galileo's
time. At that time, individuals were

this proved not to be the case.
McGee said when he was assist-
ing Hartman in another professor's
laboratory later that day, Hartman
could have exposed them to Cesium
137 - a highly radioactive material.
Though the potential source of Cesi-
um was later proved to be inactive,
when McGee asked Hartman if the
source was off, Green said Hartman
responded that he was didn't know.
McGee left the room immediately.
McGee made a complaint about
Hartman's laboratory safety to the
University's Radiation Safety Ser-
vice, Green said. Two days later,
Hartman terminated McGee of all
his responsibilities in the lab.
David Masson, the attorney
representing the University, used
his opening statement to portray
McGee in a different light.
Masson said McGee's acceptance
as a pre-candidate to the Ph.D. pro-
gram in 2004 was debated at first,
with concern about a history of
incomplete grades and a GPA that
did not fit department standards.
Masson said the worsening
relationship between McGee and
Hartman was rooted in McGee's
inability to finish tasks Hartman
assigned him. Masson said Hart-
man permitted McGee to work only
10 hours per week in his position
because McGee had received an
incomplete in a winter 2005 class.
In early December 2007, Hart-
man expressed his desire not to
renew McGee's position in the
laboratory, but McGee remained in
the position for the winter semes-
ter after Hartman's colleagues per-
suaded him to keep McGee.
After McGee sent multiple
e-mails refusingto come in to work
on the generator's safety system
despite a Feb. 25 deadline, Masson
said Hartman decided the project
would best be completed without
McGee. At this point, Hartmvan

road problems soon, Nystrom said
Michigan's roads will continue to
fall apart.
"The longer our state-elected
officials wait to act on this issue,"
he said, "the further behind we
will fall in terms of the amount of
deterioration that we see on our
roads and bridges."
e-mailed McGee to tell him he was
relieved of his duties in the lab,
though he would be paid for the
rest of the semester.
Masson said Hartman was
unaware of the safety complaints
McGee had made about him at the
time of McGee's termination.
McGee began his testimony
today, speaking of the amiable rela-
tionship he had with Hartman at
the beginning of his employment.
"I appreciated him," McGee
said. "I thought we were working
well together."
But after Hartman's failed
attempt to start up the neutron
generator in November, McGee
said he began to have concerns
about Hartman's care for safety in
the laboratory.
McGee said he couldn't make
several safety deadlines because
the credit card Hartman gave him
to make necessary purchases for
the laboratory was denied multiple
times.
McGee said he also had trouble
meeting deadlines because he
needed the fire marshal to approve
several aspects of the laboratory's
construction.
McGee said Hartman's strict
deadline demands and refusal to
schedule around McGee's final
exams was out of character for the
relationship the two men had in
the past.
"I had no idea where these
demands were coming from,"
McGee said.
Masson's cross-examination of
McGee is scheduled to take place
tomorrow.
Six women and one man make
up the jury that will determine the
outcome of the case. Two of the
jurors are University employees.
Judge Archie Brown set the trial to
last the rest of the week, with jury
deliberations to occur either Friday
or next Monday.

The Michigan Daily - michigandailycom

Highly touted freshman
gets first taste of Crisler
in exhibition win vs. WSU

Beilein impressed
by Maize Rage's
strong attendance at
Friday's game
By CHRIS MESZAROS
Daily Sports Writer
Though Michigan fans got
their first glimpse of this season's
basketball team on Friday, most
eyes were focused on one player
- freshman Darius Morris.
After the season tipped off
inside Crisler Arena, the fresh-
man jitters quickly evaporated for
Morris, who is projected to be the
team's starting
point guard. NOTEBOOK
"Before the -- --
tipoff (I felt the jitters)," Morris
said. "But as soon as I got the ball
in my hands, it was cool. It felt just
like in practice or any other kind
of game. Basketball is a simple
sport. People try to make it com-
plicated, but if you can block all
those other thoughts out, you'll
be fine."
While Morris had little impact
on the stat sheet - posting just
four points and three assists - he
excelled on the defensive end.
Morris plays at the top of Mich-
igan coach John Beilein's 1-3-1
zone, where he used his length to
disrupt the opposing offense and
his speed to lead Michigan on the
resulting fast breaks.
"I think because of his length
and how active he is and once he
learns that he is a finisher ... you
want a guy on top that's going
to finish on the break, as well,"

Beilein said. "I've really been
impressed with how quickly he
picks things up. He's long enough
to do that and really quick."
Morris, a Los Angeles native,
was recognized yesterday by Fox-
sports.com columnist Jeff Good-
man in his national "65 things to
watch during the 2009-10 season"
preview.
And one of the keys for Morris
is whether he can quickly pick up
Beilein's offense.
"I thought he did a good job,"
Beilein said. "He's learning the
offense and now hopefully he'll
find the spots and just drive it.
Don't run any plays just drive the
ball when they give it to you. He's
sorting this out. A really high IQ
player, hopefully he'll find the
sweet spot."
STRONG TURNOUT: With
the Maize Rage extended into
the southeast corner of Crisler
Arena this season, the question
remained - how many students
would actually show up for an
exhibition game?
On Friday, students made up the
bulk of the crowd and impressed
Beilein, who remembers some of
the not-so-enthusiastic crowds of
past exhibition games.
"It was tremendous," Beilein
said. "I do remember, I think, the
first exhibition game of going out
and saying, 'I thought this was
Michigan.' There was this small
crowd. It was real neat to see
everyone come out like that."
The official attendance was
9,657, but well over 1,000 were in
the Maize Rage alone.
One reason for the added sup-
port is the stipulation that stu-
dents who attend the most games

will get seating priority for the
Michigan State and Connecticut
games later this season.
Either way, the team looks to
feed off the raucousness of fans.
"Man, that was great," sopho-
more Zack Novak said. "The
Maize Rage was out there today
and I think we really fed off them
at times, and if we can have them
all year, that's like having a sixth
man on the floor."
"As soon as I
got the ball in
my hands, it
was cool."
WARMING UP: With an
upcoming schedule featuring
bottom-dweller teams like Hous-
ton Baptist and Northern Michi-
gan, the merits in favor of holding
exhibition games are question-
able.
But Beilein said these games
are key to get the team in game
shape.
"I really liked the competition
that we got today," Beilein said.
"You can't even simulate that in
practice with that kind of game
speed, especially the start of the
game.
"They hit us with a screen here
and a screen there and our kids
are thinking and trying to sort
everything out. That's why these
exhibition games are terrific for
us to start the year."

Daily Sports Editor
The Michigan Stadium tunnel is
never short of emotion.
Following a Michigan win, it's
the center of constant commotion,
endless cheers and a likely rendi-
tion of "The Victors." After a Wol-
verine loss, sorrow and frustration
radiate through the ageless tunnel.
Following Michigan's 38-36 loss
to Purdue, Tate Forcier couldn't
escape that emotion.
Encouraging fans shouted his
name like all was well, but Forcier
looked stoically at the ground and
kept walking. On his way to the
Michigan locker room, the fresh-
man quarterback forcibly ripped
off his wristbands, one by one, and
threw all four to the ground.
His frustration was understand-
able. Although he finished 15-of-24
and tossed his firstctouchdown pass
in more than a month, Forcier's
third-quarter fumble on an option
pitch led to a quick 19-yard touch-
down score for the Boilermakers.
During the Wolverines' 4-0
start, any "freshman mistakes"
were masked by Forcier's late,
game-winning touchdown drives
against Notre Dame and Indiana. It
seemed fair, then, to expect Forci-
er to be more mature than his age
would suggest.
But during Michigan's five
straight conference losses, it's been
easy to find faults with the 19-year-
old freshman under center. During
his four-game touchdown-throw-

ing drought, which started in Iowa
on Oct. 10, Forcier completed just
47.3 percent of his passes, fumbled
five times and threw two intercep-
tions.
"That's my fault a little bit -
making the little freshman mis-
takes that you don't want to make,"
Forcier said yesterday. "Turnovers
happen, and you've just got to put
it behind you. Especially these next
two games, you can't have any."
With just two games remaining,
on the road at Wisconsin and at
home against Ohio State, Forcier is
taking it upon himself to make sure
nothingslips through the cracks.
For Michigan to garner the
all-important sixth victory and
become bowl eligible, Forcier
will have to show the resiliency,
strength and accuracy he displayed
in the Wolverines' early-season
wins.
"You can never send your seniors
out empty-handed," Forcier said.
"That's something I don't want to
do. A lot of it's on me and how I play,
how I motivate these guys."
If coming back from an injury
is a motivational factor, Forcier
has done his share this season.
His injuries have piled on quickly
- wrist, shoulder and concussion
- and now include his left knee,
which he twisted Saturday during
the third quarter. Forcier said the
knee injury would require him to
wear a sleeve.
But even as he has battled inju-
ries, Forcier says he has become
more comfortable with the pace of

the game. On Saturday, he looked
more at ease in the pocket and
showed less of the "happy feet" he's
been known for. Yesterday, Forcier
said he has noticed the game has
slowed down forhim since theWol-
verines lost to Illinois on Oct. 31.
"I told him this last week, ... 'I've
got to ask you to perform and act
and be older than what you are,' "
Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez
said. "If he's 19 years old, you have
to act and play and behave like a 21,
22-year-old. That's easier said than
done."
In the Wolverines' upcoming
games, many are expecting Forcier
to hold the keys to potential upsets
against Wisconsin or Ohio State.
But according to him, that means
reverting backto his old ways.
"I'm trying to do what I was
doing at the beginning of the sea-
son - getting the athletes the ball,
let them be athletes," Forcier said.
"I did a great job last week, getting
Roy(Roundtree)the ballandlethim
play. It's hard when things aren't
going right. You want to be the guy
to answer that question."

After being swept by Miami, how
good is this team?

ast weekend's games
started with the Michigan
student section lookingup
at the top rows of Yost Ice Arena,
chanting at the small Miami con-
tingent in attendance. And after
the Wolverines' subsequent on-ice
play, Michigan will be looking up
to Miami for a
long time. MIKE
A 5-1 loss FLOREK
to Miami on
Saturday com- On ice hockey
pleted the road
sweep for the top-ranked Red-
Hawks, who were 3-43-1 at Yost
all-time coming into the weekend.
But the Wolverines' defeat is more
telling of the young season than
just abad loss.
All four of the Wolverines'
losses have come against currently
ranked opponents. The teams they
have beaten are a combined 9-17-3.,
For an average team, that may
be tolerable. For the fourth-ranked
team in the country - ateam with
the best defensive unit in four
years and a returning Hobey Baker
finalist - it's unacceptable.
If it isn't time for concern yet, a
bad series against No.17 Michigan
State next weekend should turn
the fan base rightfully into crisis
mode.
"We're a pretty good team, but
maybe we're notgood as we think
we are, and maybe we're not as
good as (the media) thinks we are,"
Michigan coach Red Berenson

said. "We'll find that out as the
year goes on, butright now that's a
lowpoint."
There is still time to figure out
how "pretty good" they really are,
but it isn't as early in the season
as you might think. Michigan is
just about a fourth of the way into
the season, and already has lost as
many games against ranked teams
as it did when it went to the Frozen
Four in 2008. Last season, which
culminated ina first-round upset
loss to Air Force, the Wolverines
went 5-6-0 against ranked oppo-
nents.
To get to the Frozen Four,
Michigan has to beat teams they
aren't necessarily supposed to
beat. If the Wolverines can't beat
them in the regular season, how
can they expect to beat them in
the postseason? Being over .500
against ranked teams in 2008 had
to playa role in the confidence the
Wolverines had heading into the
NCAA Tournament. They knew
they could beat the best.
These types of series, especially
against top-ranked teams, can
build that confidence and define
your season. When you get out-
scored 8-2 on the weekend, the
definition of your team isn't what
you want.
Now, Michigan must respond,
something it failed to do during
this weekend series. Once the
RedHawks took the lead in both
games, the Wolverines never ven
