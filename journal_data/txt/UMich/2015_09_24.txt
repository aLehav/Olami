Daily Staff Reporter

Say goodbye to CTools.
In 
an 
e-mail 
Wednesday 

afternoon, 
University 
Provost 

Martha E. Pollack and Laura M. 
Patterson, associate vice presi-
dent and chief information offi-
cer, announced that beginning 
with the fall 2016 semester, all 
new course sites will be hosted by 
Canvas.

Canvas, piloted during the 

2014-2015 academic year, is a dig-
ital course management system 
with discussion boards, class-
room notifications and a plat-
form for submitting assignments, 
among other features.

The pilot included more than 

10,000 students, 150 instructors 

and 130 courses. Of that group, 
92 percent of faculty and 100 per-
cent of student focus group par-
ticipants either preferred Canvas 
to CTools or were neutral to the 
change.

In a press release, Wallace 

Hopp, professor of industrial and 
operations engineering and Busi-
ness School associate dean for 
learning and design, said his tran-
sition to Canvas went smoothly.

“I love the fact that it’s becom-

ing a standard in our industry. I’m 
talking to some of the other top 
business schools and they’re on 
Canvas, making it very easy for us 
to share best practices,” he said. 
“I converted over to Canvas this 
year and I’m really pleased. I am 
facilitating a flipped classroom 
delivery and have set-up digital 
videos and online assessments 
through Canvas. It’s worked flaw-
lessly for me.”

The flipped classroom is a 

model in which lectures are 
delivered online and are watched 
outside of class, allowing profes-

GOP presidential 

contender, ‘U’ 

alum emphasizes 
conservative values

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

SPRING ARBOR, Mich. — 

Chanting “Go Ben, Go!” and 
“USA! USA! USA!” the crowd of 
Ben Carson supporters who filled 
Spring Arbor University’s gym-

nasium exploded with applause 
as the former neurosurgeon and 
University alum walked on stage.

Recent polls place Carson, 

who is running for the Republi-
can nomination for president, in 
second or third place in the GOP 
field, behind Donald Trump and 
in close competition with former 
Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fio-
rina.

Known for his Christian prin-

ciples and rags-to-riches story, 
it’s not surprising Carson chose 
to speak at the small Christian 
university in Spring Arbor. Brent 

Ellis, Spring Arbor University 
president, led the crowd in prayer 
during his opening remarks.

Prior to Caron’s arrival, Sen. 

Mike Shirkey (R–Clarklake) and 
Rep. Earl Poleski (R–Jackson) 
eased the anxious crowd await-
ing Carson — who was stuck in 
traffic — with a rendition of “God 
Bless America.”

Carson opened his speech by 

describing his life story, reflect-
ing on how his mother’s faith in 
God helped him excel in school. 
In elementary school, Carson 
said he struggled academically 

and envied others in class who 
were naturally gifted in school.

Growing up in poverty in 

Detroit, his mother forced him 
and his brother to get serious 
about their education by mak-
ing each of the boys write a book 
report every week — it was only 
later they discovered she was 
illiterate.

“I was not very enthusiastic 

about this program — and that’s 
putting it very lightly — I didn’t 
want to do that, her friends were 
always criticizing her. They 

IFC prevents Greek 
life involvement in 
annual event after 
SAE loses charter

By JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily Staff Reporter

The Mud Bowl, a charity touch 

football game hosted annually by 
the University’s since-disbanded 
chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fra-
ternity, will not be played this year.

In the last five years, the event 

has raised more than $100,000 for 
C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital.

The Interfraternity Council has 

said Mud Bowl cannot be held due 
to a standing policy that forbids fra-
ternities from co-sponsoring events 
with chapters that have been dis-
banded. The University’s SAE chap-
ter, which has hosted the football 
game for 82 years, lost recognition 
from its national chapter this year.

The policy forbids fraternities 

from co-sponsoring events with 
illegitimate organizations — such 
as an organization that is on social 
probation, suspended or expelled 
from the IFC — or they run the 
risk being disbanded themselves. 

Though IFC can’t prevent a private 
group from hosting an event, Greek 
life members — who have histori-
cally made up a large portion of the 
event’s participants — would face 
discipline if they were to participate 
this year.

IFC President Alex Krupiak said 

the policy was not created with the 
knowledge that it would result in 
the discontinuation of Mud Bowl. 
He said, at that time, SAE was in 
good standing with the IFC. SAE 
was expelled from the IFC in 2011 
for hazing.

“It’s not something that was cre-

ated in recent times,” Krupiak said, 
“It was definitely more than three 
years ago at minimum.”

Former SAE President Brett 

Mizzi, a Business senior, said 
Greek life is misapplying the policy, 
because anyone who forms a seven-
person team is invited to partici-
pate.

“The fact that the University is 

trying to intervene on individual 
students’ decisions about whether 
to play a touch football game or not 
is absurd,” Mizzi said.

Public Policy junior Zachary 

Dubin, a former member of SAE, 
said halting the tradition of Mud 
Bowl was unfair to previous genera-

Some students 
say they prefer 
renovation of 
current facility 

By ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

During the height of #BBUM 

— the student-driven campaign 
that aimed to draw attention to 
the experiences and challenges 
of Black students on campus 
— the movement’s leadership 
stressed the importance of relo-
cating the Trotter Multicultur-

al Center closer to campus.

But at a forum on Wednes-

day, several students were hesi-
tant about moving the facility, 
even as the University consid-
ers options for a new location. 
E. Royster Harper, vice presi-
dent for student life, joined 
several University officials at 
Trotter to solicit input on the 
process. During the session, 
Harper emphasized the need to 
honor the legacy of the original 
facility, even if the University 
moves forward with plans to 
construct a new one.

University officials also dis-

cussed a potential the timeline 
for building a new center and 

provided their perspective on 
the decision-making process.

The speakers included Uni-

versity Planner Susan Gott 
and Diana Adzemovic, senior 
design project manager for 
Architecture, Engineering and 
Construction at the University.

There are currently three 

locations under consideration 
for the construction of a new 
multicultural center: the site 
of the current Michigan News 
Service building on Maynard 
Street, between Betsy Barbour 
and Helen Newberry Residence 
Halls on State Street and near 
the Munger Residences on 

Peddle-powered, 
booze-friendly

Trolley Pub, which offers ped-

al-powered trolley tours in cities 
across the country and encourag-
es riders of age to bring their own 
alcohol, is opening a branch in 
downtown Ann Arbor. The trol-
leys can transport up to 14 riders, 
who all help prop the trolley with 
foot pedals, similar to a paddle 
board.

The BYOB-style pub also offers 

hop-on, hop-off service at several 
Ann Arbor bars and local land-
marks.

Ann Arbor Trolley Pub will 

start offering rides on Friday, 
beginning at the Heidelberg res-

first two weeks, the company will 
offer free promotional rides. Cus-

Peter Smereka won 
teaching honors, 
national awards

By TANAZ AHMED

Daily Staff Reporter

Mathematics 
Prof. 
Peter 

Smereka died unexpectedly Sept. 15 
following a heart attack.

Smereka began working at the 

University in 1994 as an assistant 
professor of mathematics. He was 
promoted to a full professorship 
in 2003. Smereka obtained a 
bachelor’s degree in physics from 
the University of Waterloo, Canada, 
in 1983 and a Ph.D. doctorate in 
chemical engineering from the 
University of California, Santa 
Barbara, in 1989.

During his time at the University, 

Smereka was a member of the 
Michigan Center for Theoretical 
Physics. He was also a part of the 

math department’s Applied and 
Interdisciplinary 
Mathematics 

program, which he directed for 
several years. He also helped 
develop and instruct an honors 
program for freshman science and 
engineering students.

While in Ann Arbor, Smereka 

was awarded the National Science 
Foundation Career Award in 1996 
and the Excellence in Education 
Award from LSA in 1997.

In an obituary submitted by 

the Smereka family and the math 
department, family and colleagues 
described him as funny and 
insightful.

“Smereka was always inquisitive 

and provided a lot of humor, insight 
and thought-provoking questions 
for his family over the years,” 
they wrote. “He was an incredibly 
sensitive and kind person often 
running to help his family members 
when in need.”

Smereka published more than 

60 research articles throughout his 

lifetime. His work in fluid dynamics 
— the science behind liquids and 
gases in motion — was influential.

Condolences 
from 
faculty 

members filled the comments 
section of the obituary posted 
on the website for the University 
Record.

“Peter was a dearest friend and 

my best colleague,” wrote Giovanni 
Russo, a mathematics professor at 
the University of Catania in Italy. 
“To work with him has been one 
of the most exciting experiences of 
my life. Very dedicated to science, 
with an extraordinary good taste 
for interesting problems, he was an 
extremely sensitive, scrupulous and 
kind man with highest intellectual 
honesty. I always admired him, and 
I will miss him forever.”

A memorial will be held for 

Smereka in the spring. Memorial 
contributions can be made to the 
Peter Smereka Memorial Graduate 
Student Fund.

Ann Arbor staple to 
shutter storefront 
after two decades

By LEA GIOTTO

Daily Staff Reporter

BethAnn Karmeisool, owner 

of the S3 Safe Sex Store, said 
Wednesday the store will close 
its doors at the end of October.

She said her decision to close 

the storefront, located on South 
University Avenue, is a result of 
her building being sold and the 
recent decline of in-store sales.

“My building has been sold 

and I don’t know the future 
of the building,” Karmeisool 
said. “I don’t know exactly, but 
the rumors are the building is 
going to be knocked down for a 
larger project to go up much like 
Landmark.”

The owner said she thinks 

sales have declined in recent 
months 
due 
to 
increased 

competition and popularity of 
online retailers, such as Amazon 
Prime.

While physical sales have 

decreased, Karmeisool said the 
need for the community outreach 
services she offers, such as free 
HIV 
testing 
and 
individual 

counseling, have increased.

“I think (the closing) is going 

to have a large impact on the 
community because of all of the 
services we do provide,” she said. 
“People in the community are 
going to have to go elsewhere 
for that, and many do not have 
transportation options.”

Karmeisool 
stressed 
that 

while she close the physical 
storefront, S3 is not going out of 
business.

She is going to maintain S3’s 

online store, which is currently 

running in tandem with the 
storefront location. She plans 
to update the store’s website 
to include a blog stocked with 
sexual health information. 

“That telephone number will 

be linked directly to me, so if any 
student needs someone to talk to, 
and they don’t have that outlet, I 
will still be available to them as 
much as possible,” Karmeisool 
said.

The owner also ensured she 

will remain involved with the 
University 
through 
outreach 

programs, as a visiting lecturer 
at the School of Public Policy and 
through hosting sexual health 
workshops.

“I 
plan 
on 
quarterly 

workshops where people can 
get their sexual health questions 
asked, learn about new things 
going on with sexual health 
at large and also get free HIV 
testing,” she said.

Safe Sex Store closes 
amid declining sales

Thompson Street and Pack-

ard Street. Planners are also still 
considering an alternative plan 
to renovate the current center on 
Washtenaw Avenue.

Trotter Director Jackie Simpson 

said in a poll of 715 students, most 
respondees said they preferred the 
State Street location.

Amid talk of relocating, LSA 

senior Bree Sullivan pointed to the 
significance of the current build-
ing for many students. She said 
for decades, the building has been 
a home for minority students on 
campus — and the space may not 
feel as safe if located closer to cam-
pus.

“This is a lot of history, this 

building,” she said. “I want it, and I 
want future generations to have it.”

Harper recalled the tradition 

and activism from which the Trot-
ter Center was born. According to 
their website, Trotter opened in 
1971 as a space to hold meetings 

and cultural events for Black stu-
dents. The desire for the multicul-
tural center grew out of efforts by 
the Black Action Movement and 
other prominent civil rights move-
ments in the 1970s.

“We are doing for the next gener-

ation what the people you were talk-
ing about did for you,” Harper said.

However, Harper also drew 

upon the difficulties that come 
with the current Trotter location. 
The decision to build a new mul-
ticultural center closer to campus 
came from organizers of the 2013 
#BBUM movement, who said the 
site’s location between fraterni-
ties and sororities made minority 
students feel uncomfortable when 
walking back and forth at night.

“This movement to move as 

fast as it can has been built on the 
notion that this place does not meet 
students’ needs,” Harper said. “We 
are at some point going to have to 
say this is what we need.”

Gott listed the criteria that stu-

dents and administrators worked 
on last year when looking for sites 
of a new center. Some of these cri-
teria included making sure the new 

space is able to accommodate ban-
quet or multi-purpose rooms and is 
near loading and unloading docks 
for special events. The checklist 
also prioritizes a new location near 
the Diag and other student servic-
es — such as transit, food services, 
study spaces and computer labs.

Gott said the administration has 

worked to expedite the selection 
process to fulfill the needs of a new 
multicultural center on campus.

“What is so unique here is we 

just spent a lot more time with the 
students,” Gott said. “We asked 
over and over again what Trotter 
should be doing for Michigan.”

Sullivan also suggested building 

a space solely for Black students, 
adding that the voices of Black 
students are sometimes overshad-
owed. She said though the stu-
dents at the time of the #BBUM 
movement liked the idea of moving 
Trotter closer to Central Campus, 
students now might not feel the 
same way.

“I would say we should take 

into consideration how times 
change, and how things in world 
are changing around us,” Sullivan 

said. “What students might need at 
the moment could be very different 
from what they needed two years 
ago.”

Rackham student Asya Harri-

son, secretary of Students of Color 
of Rackham, said while moving to 
Central Campus would allow for 
more use of the site, Trotter would 
lose its current quietness and dis-
tance from classes and schoolwork.

“That is one of the downsides, it 

will get a different kind of use and 
more use,” Harper said.

Social Work student Zachary 

Pritchett said though he likes the 
current location of Trotter, moving 
the building would lead to more 
visibility on campus and subse-
quently a larger voice on campus 
issues. He pointed to the Spectrum 
Center as an example of a powerful 
voice because of their location in 
the Michigan Union.

Gott said no matter the deci-

sion on renovating or relocat-
ing Trotter, it is important to 
remember the history of the cen-
ter and the significance it will 
have for future generations of 
students.

sors to spend in-class hours trou-
bleshooting with students as they 
work through assignments and 
projects.

This semester, more than 1,700 

University courses and 28,700 
students are using Canvas. For 
the rest of the academic year, 
instructors will be able to choose 
between either system.

However, 
students 
have 

expressed frustration with the 
simultaneous use of CTools and 
Canvas, 
a 
grievance 
Pollack 

acknowledged in the e-mail and 
in a September interview with 
The Michigan Daily.

“I can appreciate the chal-

lenge,” she said in September. 
“On the other hand, we’re such a 

big University that we can’t really 
just flip a switch and do it all at 
once. When you go through sys-
tem changes there’s just always a 
little period of some added chal-
lenge.”

Pollack accepted a recom-

mendation from the group who 
oversaw the pilot program — 
the Digital Innovation Advisory 
Group’s Digital Ecosystem Sub-
committee — to expedite the full 
transition to Canvas by fall 2016.

The University of Michigan’s 

Dearborn campus, as well as 
close to 700 other schools across 
the country, currently use Can-
vas.

In an interview Wednesday 

morning before the transition 
was 
announced, 
Comparative 

Literature Prof. Silke-Maria Wei-
neck, chair of the Senate Advisory 
Committee on University Affairs, 

said she thought the transition 
process had been well handled 
and that faculty were generally 
optimistic about it. 

“There’s been a lot of consulta-

tion, so we think that’s been done 
well,” Weineck said. “There’s 
been a lot of faculty input, there’s 
been a careful pilot program 
to identify possible programs, 
so fingers-crossed. There are 
always transition costs.”

Public Health Prof. David 

Mendez, chair of the Digital 
Ecosystem Subcommittee, said 
in the release that faculty should 
take advantage of the resources 
available to aid their transition.

“I encourage faculty to exper-

iment with Canvas and to engage 
with colleagues who have used 
it,” he said. “Talk to your local IT 
support or instructional design-
ers who can help you get the 

most out of Canvas. Once people 
start using Canvas, they realize 
the transition is not that hard and 
the rewards far exceed the cost of 
moving to a new system. I encour-
age our colleagues not to wait too 
long to get started.”

The University’s ITS Ser-

vice Center is offering Convert-
2Canvas assistance, available to 
instructors upon request. The 
service moves material for facul-
ty from CTools to Canvas within 
a few days.

Existing 
course 
sites 
on 

CTools will be available through 
August 2017, at which point they 
will be archived and available 
to faculty upon request. CTools 
sites not used for courses — such 
as those created for student orga-
nizations, research and other 
projects — will remain active for 
now.

would say: ‘You can’t make your 
boys sit around reading books, 
they’ll grow up and they’ll hate 
you.’ … I didn’t like it much at 
first, but as I started reading these 
books, I started knowing stuff; 
stuff that nobody else knew. And 
within the space of a year and a 
half I went from the bottom of the 
class to the top of the class.”

Carson graduated from the 

University’s Medical School in 
1977 and spent his career at Johns 
Hopkins University.

He said growing up he always 

aspired to be a doctor, but did not 
think his career would take a turn 
into politics.

“I never thought when I left 

Michigan that I would end up in 
the political arena,” Carson said.

Though he deemed the higher 

education proposals of other 
candidates fiscally irresponsible, 
including a plan proposed by Ver-
mont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Dem-
ocratic presidential candidate, 
to provide free, universal high-
er education, Carson’s speech 
focused on the key role education 
plays in economic advancement.

He recalled the nation’s history 

of emphasizing education, dating 
back to the early colonists who 
settled the Massachusetts Bay 
Colony.

“That’s one of the reasons we 

were able to rise from nothing 
to the pinnacle of the world on 
such short order,” Carson said. 
“Think about this: before Ameri-
ca came on the scene — 100 years, 
500 years, 1,000, 3,000, 5,000 — 
people did things the same way. 
Within 200 years of the advent 
of America, men were walking on 
the moon. This is the most excep-
tional nation in the world.”

He said for all the bad things 

people say about the United 
States, there are still always peo-
ple trying to come here and not 
very many trying to leave.

In a span of five minutes, Car-

son was able to touch on all of the 
major social points of contention 
in the election: women’s rights, 
religious freedom and same-sex 
marriage.

“The war on women — what 

a phony thing to say. That is all 
hype,” Carson said. “I say that as 
someone whose life was shaped 
and made successful by women. I 
have the most wonderful mother, 
the most wonderful wife, PAs, 

administrative 
assistants, 
col-

leagues who are women, and who 
I could never have been success-
ful without them, and I recognize 
that. I think most Americans rec-
ognize that.”

Carson also cited examples of 

places where women are worse 
off than in the United States.

“There are some nations in the 

world where they don’t recognize 
that — where women are not even 
allowed to drive, where their tes-
timony in court is worth half as 
much as a man’s, where they’re 
treated more like children than 
like equals,” he said.

On the issue of religious rights 

in the U.S., Carson referenced the 
founding fathers — many of whom 
came to the New World to escape 
religious oppression in Europe. 
He called particular attention to 
Benjamin Franklin, who, Carson 
recounted, asked the founding 
fathers to pray together during 
the stressful process of writing 
the Constitution.

“(The founding fathers) felt 

very strongly that we must do 
everything we can to allow peo-
ple to practice their faith,” Carson 
said. “Many people in our nation 
today who think that our consti-
tution’s law says we should be free 

from religion, but no, it’s freedom 
of religion.”

Despite this outspoken support 

of the First Amendment, Carson 
made national news Tuesday 
when, during an appearance on 
“Meet the Press,” he said he was 
against the election of a Muslim 
president.

Carson said while he disagrees 

with the Supreme Court decision 
in June to permit same-sex mar-
riage in the United States, he has 
nothing against people who are 
gay.

“I personally believe that the 

Supreme Court made a mistake 
when they basically voted to 
change the definition of marriage 
from what it has been tradition-
ally for thousands of years,” he 
said. “I have nothing against gay 
people — zero — but, I’m a prag-
matic person and I realize if you 
change the definition of marriage 
for one group, what right do you 
have not to change it for the next 
group, and the next group, and 
the next group.”

Carson is one of several GOP 

candidates to visit Michigan in 
recent months. Over the week-
end, five Republican contenders 
spoke to state party leaders at 
conference on Mackinac Island.

tions of University students.

“We really want to continue it, 

for the literally thousands of peo-
ple who have played in it and have 
memories of it,” Dubin said.

Mary Beth Seiler, director of the 

Office of Greek life, said the dis-
continuation of Mud Bowl is only 
in response to the involvement of 
members of the former SAE, who 
fall under the category of “rogue.”

“Nobody is trying to discontinue 

the Mud Bowl in Greek Life,” Seiler 
said, “If another organization that 
was recognized were sponsoring 
the Mud Bowl, that would not be a 
problem.”

Rogue fraternities refer to a 

situation in which the chapter is 
either removed from the IFC or its 
national organization withdraws 
recognition. Seiler said SAE has 
been considered a rogue organiza-
tion since it was expelled from the 
IFC, but lost ts national charter this 
summer.

Seiler added that the Office of 

Greek Life simply requests that fra-
ternities uphold the policies they 
have passed. “It’s part of the bylaws, 
and that is why the students will be 
unable to participate, based upon 
our rules,” Krupiak said. “If it were 
hosted by an IFC fraternity, that 
fraternity should be allowed to play, 
but because it’s SAE, they’re not.”

on the Office of Greek Life to allow 
SAE to reinstate the Mud Bowl cur-
rently has 1,421 signatures. 

ney, but will not be permitted to 
bring liquor.

Evan 
Wood, 
Trolley 
Pub’s 

regional manager based in North 
Carolina, helps set up new loca-
tions nationally. He said the com-
pany has been in communication 
with Ann Arbor officials to ensure 
a smooth launch.

“Before we start in new loca-

tions, we build a relationship and 
start conversations with the chief 
of police, City Council and any-
body that may have a major role,” 
Wood said. “We do a lot of public 
relations so that we’re in no way 
inconspicuous.”

Amanda Swan, managing part-

ner for the Ann Arbor Trolley Pub, 
said she is excited to get business 
started.

“It’s going to be really, really 

fun,” Swan said. “I’m excited to 
kick it off by having a complete 
public kick-off, like a meet and 
greet. Anyone can hop on and hop 
off.”

A 14-person private tour costs 

$375. However, if a party does 

not have enough people to fill the 
entire pedal pub, they can pur-
chase $30 single tickets to ride on 
a “mixer” pedal-pub. Both options 
include a tour around the down-
town area and the option to stop at 
bars along the route.

Swan said the pedal pub oper-

ates like any stationary restaurant 
or bar.

“We card everyone that wants 

to drink,” Swan said. “People 
that are over 21 get a stamp on 
their hand so we know they can 
drink and we have a tour conduc-
tor or driver that keeps an eye on 
things.”

Despite the drinking, guests as 

young as 13 years old are allowed 
to ride.

Trolley Pub first opened in 

North Carolina and has expanded 
around the country. Swan start-
ing working for Trolley Pub in 
Madison, Wis. After she moved 
to Detroit, the company asked if 
she was interesting in setting up 
a location in Michigan. Swan told 
the company Ann Arbor would be 
the perfect location.

“I just love the restaurant scene. 

It’s such a fun downtown,” Swan 
said. “It’s something for every-
one, and the energy is really good. 

People are open and relaxed, it’s 
fun and there’s a vibe. I’m excited 
to bring an interesting way to get 
around downtown and for people 
to see Ann Arbor.”

In July, Gov. Rick Snyder signed 

a law allowing individuals to con-
sume beer and wine while pedal-
ing from bar to bar. That means 
pedal trolleys in the state can now 
allow their customers to drink 
beer or wine while on board. How-
ever, individual cities are permit-
ted to pass their own ordinances 
against drinking.

Ann Arbor does not currently 

have an ordinance outlining rules 
and regulations for pedal-pow-
ered pubs. City Councilmember 
Jane Lumm (I–Ward 2), who is 
a member of the Liquor License 
Review Committee, said the city 
is working to fast-track an ordi-
nance.

“The Liquor License Advisory 

Committee and the city staff are at 
this time doing the necessary due 
diligence,” Lumm said. “We’re 
obtaining the necessary staff and 
stakeholder input to inform the 
development of an ordinance and 
policy recommendation for the 
committee’s consideration. The 
committee will then make a rec-

ommendation for council consid-
eration.”

It is unclear whether drinking 

will be banned on the trolley pubs 
or merely regulated. Some cities, 
like Royal Oak, have voted to com-
pletely ban drinking on board.

Wood said the pedal pubs will 

respect whatever ordinance the 
city produces. He also said they 
would continue tours alcohol-free 
if necessary.

“We do a very good job of self-

regulating and I think if it goes 
well-enough and they see how 
responsible we are, hopefully that 
will turn into less of a concern,” 
Wood said. “We like to not take 
advantage of the laws and city that 
we’re in.”

The city has also expressed 

concerns about customers of Trol-
ley Pub exiting the vehicle with 
open containers. Wood said they 
have a zero-tolerance policy with 
open containers leaving the pedal 
pub.

“You wouldn’t walk out of a 

bar into the street with a beer 
or drink, so don’t do that here,” 
Wood said. “We put city laws and 
ordinances way before we worry 
about getting a bad review on Yelp 
or TripAdvisor.”

S

anitary products including tampons, 
pads, panty liners and even the cost-
conscious, eco-friendly DivaCup are 

items taxed in all but five 
U.S. states. Besides Massa-
chusetts, Maryland, Min-
nesota, New Jersey and 
Pennsylvania, the United 
States considers the tam-
pon to be a nonessential item and a luxury (like 
a yacht or Lady Gaga’s dog’s collar). As if being 
a female isn’t costly enough, we pay to have our 
periods like it’s something we enjoy. “Wow, I’m 
sooo looking forward to this new box of pads. 
I can’t wait to get home and try one on!” an 
eager PMSer exclaims. Or, “Girl — could I trade 
you a regular for a super? That’s one rare rag I 
must get for my collection,” because feminine 
hygiene is just that fun.

It’s like we are all in this club, and we keep 

paying the same union dues, but there are no 
visible changes being made to improve our 
group’s experience. Instead, we continue to 
fight for equality, basic rights for our own 
bodies, respect for our existence, health care, 
access to contraception — all the while pay-
ing a tax on something that is considered dis-
pensable by a group of males in power. At this 
point, who wouldn’t jump at the idea of invol-
untary muscle contractions and fluctuating 
hormones? Sign me the “F” up.

This is an essential part of being a woman; 

it isn’t an accident or something we choose 
to have. Females bleed, we have periods, and 
affordable feminine hygiene has always been 
a necessity. This should not even be in ques-

tion. As basic as they are, tampons are expen-
sive (with an average box costing about $6.99). 
What makes an already fundamental need out 
of reach is placing a tax on it, which discrimi-
nates against women for having menstrual 
cycles in the first place. This sanitary tax puts 
women in a position of irregularity (no allu-
sion intended) where we pay to acknowledge 
our biological differences from men. If you can 
agree that our reproductive systems are our 
own business and not the government’s, the 
sooner we can all agree that no gender should 
be taxed. This brings us closer to the necessary 
separation of body and state/body and nation.

Over the course of a lifetime, the amount of 

money we spend on tampons and pads proves 
that having a period isn’t cheap. I mean it’s 
actually ridiculous. Let’s be real. For the sake 
of progress: Canada recently passed a motion 
to drop the tax completely. Yet in the United 
States, the sales tax for sanitary products still 
ranges from 4 to 9 percent. This is a nation-
wide dilemma and I hope these facts motivate 
more petitions and women who fight for rep-
resentation. We have a long way to go, ladies 
— but don’t forget how luxurious periods are 
in the meantime. “WOMEN FOR GLITZ: We 
put the bling-bling in reproductive systems!” 
“Period? MORE LIKE SURPRISE PARTY!” 
“Period? Let’s celebrate with these decorative 
plates. I hope you like them.”

Let’s do something about this.

FROM THE DAILY

O

n Friday, the U.S. House voted to defund Planned 
Parenthood (248-177) based upon false beliefs surrounding 
its abortion services. The Center for Medical Progress, 

an anti-abortion group, recently released several videos depicting 
Planned Parenthood workers discussing the sale of fetal tissue for 
profit, an illegal act under federal law. Shortly after their release, the 
videos were criticized for unethical reporting, misleading edits and 
referred to as contributions of a prolonged campaign of deception. 
Unfortunately, the videos were the basis of many Republican 
arguments to defund the organization in their recent House vote. 
Their vote to defund Planned Parenthood is deplorable and we 
strongly encourage the House of Representatives to consider the 
facts and popular opinion before making such rash decisions.

A house misled

Representatives must consider facts, opinions before voting

F

ast and brash, Donald Trump 
has certainly succeeded in 
enrapturing the American 

public with his 
unconventional 
presidential cam-
paign. We have 
watched 
him 

before, 
hosting 

“The 
Appren-

tice” and “Celeb-
rity Apprentice” 
as he cashed in 
for 
providing 

us with raucous 
entertainment 
disguised 
as 

legitimate business. We should ask 
ourselves how he would cash in 
armed with the disguise as the dem-
ocratically elected American presi-
dent. Because he would cash in.

What lies beneath the show is the 

quagmire of this campaign. Accu-
sations of associations with the 
Italian-American mafia, running 
an alleged scam known as Trump 
University and shepherding four 
businesses into bankruptcy bring 
about questions regarding how he 
would run the country.

First, if the mob association accu-

sations made by Pulitzer Prize-win-
ning journalist David Cay Johnston 
and journalist Wayne Barrett are 
true, Trump has done business with 
Philadelphia and New York crime 
families. He purchased the future 
site of Atlantic City’s Trump Plaza 
for twice its market value from 
Philadelphia 
mobster 
Salvatore 

Testa and constructed the casino 
using two firms controlled by Phil-
adelphia mob boss “Little Nicky” 
Scarfo. Additionally, Trump Tower 
and other New York City proper-
ties were constructed with con-
crete from a firm owned by NYC 
bosses “Fat Tony” Salerno and “Big 
Paul” Castellano. These ties reveal 
Trump’s resolve to achieve business 

at any cost and a potential presiden-
cy marked by cronyism and corrup-
tion. The price for our country could 
be steep if Mr. Trump facilitated 
organized crime as America’s leader.

Furthermore, Trump ran an 

alleged scam himself. Trump Uni-
versity 
enrolled 
students 
who 

lost up to $35,000 each in fees for 
courses and seminars that failed to 
provide them with degrees or par-
ticipation in an accredited program. 
Trump is accused of overcharging 
former students for services that 
were not delivered.

Trump launched Trump Univer-

sity in 2005, offering courses and 
seminars in real estate. Fees ranged 
from $1,495 for a three-day seminar 
to up to $25,000 for individual coach-
ing. Investors’ software packages 
cost $2,000 and a “Gold Elite” pack-
age for $34,995 promised to provide 
the mentorship necessary for jump-
starting a real-estate business, but 
often the mentors were unreachable.

Controversy began when the 

New York State Bureau of Education 
declared that calling the organiza-
tion a university was possibly illegal 
in 2010, leading to the organization 
to change its name to The Trump 
Entrepreneur Initiative.

The Trump Entrepreneur Initia-

tive lasted until 2013, at which time 
the Office of the New York Attorney 
General had gathered enough evi-
dence from its 2012 investigation 
to file the civil lawsuit. The now 
defunct Trump Entrepreneur Initia-
tive was embroiled in a $40 million 
civil lawsuit filed by New York Attor-
ney General Eric Schneiderman and 
was found guilty of not obtaining 
a license for a for-profit university. 
The organization continues to face a 
class-action suit in California.

The ongoing Trump University 

fiasco indicates that Trump hasn’t 
followed all of our country’s laws and 
has been keen to take advantage of 

the more vulnerable. A Trump presi-
dency could include tax breaks and 
incentives for for-profit vocational 
schools and a reduction in Pell grants 
and government loans for nonprofit 
universities.

As college students, we must ask 

ourselves what a man who ran a for-
profit university into destruction 
would do for us. He has stated on 
numerous occasions that he wants 
to cut the U.S. Department of Educa-
tion down, perhaps as a way to ease 
regulations. He isn’t afraid to leave 
behind his messes.

Additionally, four of Trump’s 

businesses in Atlantic City declared 
bankruptcy, including: Trump’s Taj 
Mahal (1991), Trump Plaza Hotel 
(1992), Trump Hotels and Casino 
Resorts (2004) and Trump Enter-
tainment Resorts (2009). When 
asked about these bankruptcies by 
ABC’s George Stephanopoulos in 
2011, Trump remarked, “I’ve used 
the laws of this country to pare debt 
… We’ll have the company. We’ll 
throw it into a chapter. We’ll nego-
tiate with the banks. We’ll make a 
fantastic deal. You know, it’s like on 
‘The Apprentice.’ It’s not personal. 
It’s just business.”

Well, Mr. Trump, continue to 

use the laws of this country to your 
advantage. It seems to be work-
ing out. The Republican candi-
date has masterfully marketed an 
image of a blunt businessman who 
has achieved “greatness” through 
obtaining an exaggerated amount 
of wealth, but in actuality he is hus-
tling us all. His past of cutting deals 
with the mafia, scamming students 
and running his Atlantic City busi-
nesses to the ground highlight his 
lack of empathy, the most impor-
tant quality for our country’s com-
mander in chief.

Trumped and scammed 

Though most of the talk surrounding 

Planned Parenthood is based on the abortion 
services that some branches of the organiza-
tion offer, it should be noted that abortions 
only account for 3 percent of the services 
Planned Parenthood provides. In fact, the 
organization is responsible for many other 
basic sexual health services such as contra-
ception, family planning, HIV and STI testing, 
and breast exams, to name a few.

Though much of Planned Parenthood’s 

financial support comes from private dona-
tions, removing federal funding from its bud-
get may hinder access to basic sexual health 
care for those who wouldn’t regularly be able 
to afford it. According to the Guttmacher 
Institute in 2010, “Planned Parenthood pro-
vided about a third of the services to women 
who obtained contraceptive care at federally-
subsidized safety-net centers.”

Lawmakers who support the sudden end of 

federal funding to Planned Parenthood seem 
to have a skewed perception of the nonprofit 
organization. For example, Diane Black (R–
Tenn.) recently said, “Planned Parenthood 
can get their money back if they fully commit 
to what they talk about, women’s healthcare, 
and stop performing abortions for this year.” 

Federal funding given to Planned Parent-

hood is prohibited by Title X to provide abor-
tions to those who are not in medical need or 
in cases of rape or incest. Essentially, those 
who voted to defund Planned Parenthood cut 
money that did not even go toward the issue 
they are trying to stop.

Planned Parenthood dissenters simply are 

not thinking about any of the consequences to 
removing funding for a pivotal, national orga-
nization. While the cause and effect aren’t 
necessarily directly linked, closing Planned 
Parenthood facilities across the country has 

been closely correlated to various HIV out-
breaks. For example, Scott County, Ind., has 
been battling a recent HIV outbreak since the 
closing of its only Planned Parenthood back 
in 2013; the clinic that was closed didn’t even 
provide abortion services.

Aside from the increase in HIV cases, 

unplanned pregnancies will inevitably rise as 
well. Unfortunately, these are only a few of the 
unintended consequences of defunding such 
an important organization. Other repercus-
sions may be more severe.

Furthermore, polls taken by Hart Research 

associates found that 63 percent of registered 
voters are opposed to defunding Planned Par-
enthood, causing one to wonder why the deci-
sion was made in the first place. The recent 
House vote seems like a strategic political 
move with no regard for what the public actu-
ally supports. Basing their argument solely 
on accusations made against Planned Parent-
hood that were proven false further makes the 
Republicans’ case irrational. Any videos made 
by anti-abotion activists posing as Planned 
Parenthood patrons were proven to be heav-
ily edited to contain material that was not in 
fact related to what was actually happening at 
the time.

Investigating leadership within Planned 

Parenthood or any corruption that is hidden 
under the core of the institution is valid. U.S. 
citizens, including those who are registered 
Republicans, are well within their rights to call 
out any wrongdoings of Planned Parenthood 
and demand corrections accordingly. However, 
the move to completely remove federal funding 
from Planned Parenthood was wholly preemp-
tive and brash. The House needs to thorough-
ly rethink such decisions and withhold any 
impulse to make such an ill-advised political 
statement at the expense of millions.

Seeing social skills

“Y

ou don’t need peo-
ple,” I told my sister’s 
strained 
self-esteem 

on 
the 
phone 

one 
afternoon. 

“They 
aren’t 

necessary to the 
life we live. We 
are 
indepen-

dent.”

I could hear her processing the 

information on the phone. “But if 
you want some, find the people you 
want to be with; if they are more 
trouble than they are worth, let 
them go.”

I took a few seconds to listen to 

my own advice, “Call Mom and run 
that advice by her, will you? I’m not 
sure that it is healthy.” She mum-
bled she would as I hung up and 
walked to class.

Looking back, it seems that in 

addition to giving poor advice, I 
was right. It isn’t healthy.

Though I pride myself on being 

independent, it’s undeniable that 
social support has a positive impact 
on health. Having people to depend 
on, to relax with, to stop you from 
studying yourself into an early 
grave, lowers your stress, which 
affects every aspect of health, men-
tal and physical. 

A Harvard University study, 

found that a lack of strong rela-
tionships increased the risk of pre-
mature death (by all causes) by 50 
percent. This is to say, even though 
relationships 
may 
take 
effort, 

they’re imperative.

You 
hear 
that, 
Brooke? 
I 
 

was wrong.

She never asked my mom, by 
 

the way.

If you’re not one to care about 

your health, it might persuade you 
if I said fellow human beings are 
also critical in learning. This is 
something I find immensely more 
important than health, but I’ve 
never been quite right that way.

Community, it’s called. While the 

interpretation of the word may be 
the members of the town you grew 

up at, or members of the University 
you now attend, communities are 
much more. My definition of a com-
munity is people who are bonded 
by similar action. Whether paint-
ing, running, learning Spanish or 
embracing a common culture, the 
people with whom you share pas-
sions are important because of how 
you can grow from one another.

As a member of the Lloyd Hall 

Scholars Program, a Michigan 
learning community dedicated to 
writing and the arts, I have been 
exposed to new interests such as 
slam poetry and journalism, things 
I believe have made me a better 
writer. Without community, what 
knowledge am I to cultivate?

I’ve never been all that great at 

making friends. I’m not trying to 
seem pitiful, it just seems that way. 
Independence is my scapegoat, and 
while I love the friends I have, it 
takes the pressure away when I tell 
myself there isn’t a requirement to 
be sociable. But I’ve been wrong 
before.

The other morning I was sitting 

in the dining hall shoveling in some 
watermelon before heading off to 
class. Some boy, oblivious to my 
solitude and my still-sleeping brain, 
sat across from me emitting cheer. 
“How are you doing?” he asks me. I 
breathe out a “good,” my voice still 
adjusting to the sunlight. “How’s 
your first week at U of M?” I didn’t 
tell him I was a sophomore, because 
it didn’t really matter. I tried to 
muster a little enthusiasm, but plain 
pleasantries have a way of bringing 
me down. “Great,” my answer had 
no voice inflection. He wanted more 
from me: “You aren’t convincing.” 
With the same flat sound I replied, 
“That isn’t my job.” I got up and 
walked away in awe of myself, but 
now I cannot stop thinking, some-
day, it will be.

Aside from peer relationships, 

socializing with people has become 
even more crucial to our existence, 
now more so than ever. Network-
ing is necessary for entering many 

career 
fields. 
The 
University’s 

Alumni Association even states, 
“(Eighty) percent of a job-seeker’s 
energy should be focused on net-
working.”

Our futures are held in strangers’ 

hands, and so, if we want to amount 
to anything, we need to impress 
them. Luckily, our dear University 
must sense our newly adult awk-
wardness, because be it Health 
Management and Policy’s Griffith 
Leadership Center or the Tauber 
Institute for Global Operations, 
events are frequently planned to 
meet the important people with 
these strange hands. These events 
are 
decorated 
with 
appealing 

phrases like “informal conversa-
tions with senior executives” and 
“interact in a small-group setting.”

To me, those words are not 

comforting, but intimidating and 
sweaty. Whatever my personal 
comfort level, these opportunities 
are nonetheless important, and stu-
dents should take advantage of the 
generosity by practicing network-
ing at the play dates organized for 
us.

The advice I should have given 

sounds a little more like this: You 
don’t need to be a people person, 
however, you do need some people. 
Remember, though, that no relation-
ship you have should be the same. 
While you may rely on people, you 
don’t need everything from them and 
certainly not everything from one 
person. There should be people you 
rely on for loyalty, others for the pas-
sion of shared interests. Some people 
can only be relied upon when you 
need a good time (a very important 
type, I must add). There will be those 
who teach you, those who help lift 
you and those you just have to sur-
vive being around. All are important, 
but none are all-encompassing.

Life would not be impossible 

without social networking; it would 
just be a lot harder.

Michigan’s defense keys on 
aggressiveness, confidence

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

In Saturday’s game against 

UNLV, the Michigan football 
team’s 
defense 
allowed 
just 

235 total yards (92 rushing, 143 
passing), forced eight punts and 
intercepted two passes.

But another number stuck 

out to the Wolverines. And it 
frustrated them: seven points 
allowed.

“We wanted that shutout,” 

said junior cornerback Jourdan 
Lewis on Monday. “They weren’t 
supposed to score. We weren’t 
supposed to let them score, so we 
let up seven points, and that’s the 
biggest statistic we’re supposed to 
fix. There wasn’t supposed to be 
points on that board.”

Michigan 
blanked 
Oregon 

State for the last 58 minutes of 
its second game of the season 
heading into the UNLV game. 
An early touchdown prevented 
a shutout in that game, but the 
sentiment was the same: Rather 
than being pleased with giving up 
just seven points, the Wolverines 
were upset that they allowed even 
that many.

And it’s that sentiment that has 

Michigan among the top defenses 
in the country.

“Since spring ball, there’s been 

an increase in that (mentality),” 
said 
secondary 
coach 
Mike 

Zordich on Wednesday. “It’s 
something we want to build on. 
We’ve got a long way to go, but it’s 
something we want to build on.”

The first step in building on it 

will be Saturday at home against 
Brigham Young. Through three 
games, 
the 
Wolverines 
rank 

seventh in the nation in total 
defense and are tied for 12th in 
scoring defense. But they haven’t 
faced an offense as potent as 
the Cougars’, led by freshman 
quarterback 
Tanner 
Mangum 

and a host of receivers. They have 
the ability to pose an issue for 
Michigan.

But the Wolverines can counter 

with aggressiveness. They pulled 
down two interceptions Saturday. 
On 
one, 
junior 
cornerback 

Channing Stribling jumped a slant 
route and snatched the ball out 
of the air. On the other, redshirt 
junior cornerback Jeremy Clark 
stuck with his receiver, used his 
hands to gain separation and 
turned around at just the right 

moment for the interception.

Michigan might need those 

kinds of plays in its tough games 
going forward.

“We’ll line up Jourdan Lewis 

against 
a 
(6-foot-6 
receiver), 

scrappy as Jourdan is, that’s a 
tough matchup,” Zordich said. 
“But that’s how we’re going to 
play it. They’ve got to fight, for 
sure.”

And fight the Wolverines have 

on defense in each of their first 
three games. While they’ve had 
struggles of their own, they’ve 
also helped out the offense by 
getting a stop when needed or 
gaining valuable field position.

In order to do so, they’ve 

developed a confident attitude 
that’s the hallmark of all great 
defenses. More than once this 
year, Michigan has dug in while 
defending its own red zone or 
come up with a turnover to give 
the offense an opportunity.

“It might sound bad, but 

we kind of thrive off those 
situations,” said senior linebacker 
James Ross III. “We like them. 
I mean, we would like to limit 
them, but if it happens, we love 
to be back on that field, and we 
love to get the ball back for our 
offense, so if that happens we go 

back out there and we look at it as 
an opportunity. We try to do our 
best and get the ball back.”

The Wolverines will need 

that mindset, too: Their games 
are about to get closer, starting 
Saturday. 
They 
might 
find 

themselves behind and in need 
of a stop to stay in the game, or 
just ahead and in need of a stop to 
protect the lead.

As Michigan has struggled over 

the past few years, its defense has 
been more of a stopgap than a true 
asset. The Wolverines are ready 
to take the next step, aided by a 
high confidence level.

“We can be the best in the 

country if we just continue to use 
our technique,” Lewis said. “Just 
need to get the ball back, honestly. 
Need to improve on turnovers, get 
more turnovers. That’s the main 
goal.”

Asked on Wednesday about 

Lewis’ comment, Zordich — his 
position coach — smiled.

“That’s what we want them to 

think,” Zordich said. “Certainly 
the work they produce has to 
match that. We absolutely want 
that kind of attitude for those 
guys. It helps. Certainly their 
position requires that kind of 
attitude.”

Jourdan Lewis goes for a pass breakup in Michigan’s win against UNLV.

Michigan defeats Oakland, 4-1

By KEVIN SANTO 

Daily Sports Writer

ROCHESTER, Mich. — If you 

blinked, you might have missed 
it.

In the 41st minute, freshman 

forward 
Francis 
Atuahene 

received the ball on the left wing 
and — in 
a 
fashion 

that 
is 

becoming 
all too familiar to opposing 
defenders — bolted to the goal 
line before serving a perfect ball 
back to the penalty spot.

Redshirt 
sophomore 

midfielder 
Michael 
Kapitula 

found himself in the right place 
at the right time and shot the ball 
into the open net.

Kapitula’s finish broke a 1-1 tie 

and completely altered the tone of 
the game, as the Michigan men’s 
soccer team went on to cruise to a 
4-1 victory against Oakland.

“It was the last five minutes of 

the half, and Oakland had a lot of 
possession before that,” Kapitula 
said. “I feel like the goal changed 
the momentum of the game. I just 
wanted to put myself in a good 
position, and I did. The ball came 
to me, so I had a tap-in.”

The Wolverines (1-0-1 Big 

Ten, 4-2-1 overall) were the 
first to strike in the match, 
when freshman midfielder Ivo 
Cerda headed junior defender 
Rylee Woods’ corner kick from 
the six-yard box past Grizzlies’ 
goalkeeper Wes Mink in the 16th 
minute.

But Michigan’s lead was short-

lived. In the 19th minute, junior 
defender Lars Eckenrode took 
Oakland forward Gerald Ben 
down in the 18-yard box for a 
penalty kick.

Ben stepped up to the ball and 

calmly finished it up the middle, 
as sophomore goalkeeper Evan 
Louro dove early in anticipation 
that the shot would be directed to 
the right.

For the ensuing 22 minutes, 

Oakland (0-1-0 Horizon League, 
3-4 overall) had the Wolverines 
frustrated and on the defensive, 
maintaining 
the 
majority 
of 

possession and forcing Michigan 
to play long balls to its target 
forwards. The Grizzlies drew six 
fouls in the same timeframe — a 
sampling of the physicality of the 
matchup, in which the two teams 
accumulated 33 fouls and five 
yellow cards. 

Eventually, Kapitula and the 

Wolverines recovered to finish 
on an opportunity that sent them 
into halftime with a lead.

“When we made it 2-1, I think 

that was a dagger,” said Michigan 

coach Chaka Daley. “Oakland had 
a little sense of belief after getting 
a penalty kick that could get them 
going, and we stifled that pretty 
quickly (when Kapitula) put it 
away nicely.

“Ramp up the intensity was 

the conversation at halftime. And 
make sure we’re not complacent 
with 2-1. And I think the guys 
did a great job of responding to 
that.”

Michigan 
ended 
the 
half 

with a 10-4 shot advantage and 
carried the momentum from 
Kapitula’s goal into the second 
half.

At the onset of the second half, 

the Wolverines regained control 
of possession and dictated the 
pace of play, while finding ways to 
combine with each other instead 
of sending long balls.

And as Michigan’s pressure 

on Oakland mounted, Atuahene 

finally put the game out of 
reach in the 64th minute. After 
receiving a ball near the 18-yard 
box, Atuahene carried the ball 
to the corner of the six-yard box 
before firing a shot near-post past 
Mink.

From that point, Michigan 

coasted to victory, and senior 
forward William Mellors-Blair 
added a fourth goal in the 85th 
minute to put the finishing 
touches 
on 
the 
Wolverines’ 

fourth win of the season.

After coming away victorious 

Sunday in its first Big Ten game 
against Northwestern, Michigan 
followed 
up 
the 
impressive 

performance with a win over 
an in-state foe the Wolverines 
haven’t 
always 
fared 
well 

against.

Now the key for Michigan is to 

stay consistent as it heads into the 
bulk of the Big Ten schedule.

‘M’ defies history 
in blowout victory

By KATIE CONKLIN

Daily Sports Writer

ROCHESTER, Mich. — It 

was clear that the Michigan 
men’s soccer team was in enemy 
territory during its Wednesday 
night game at Oakland. The 
game drew a crowd of more than 
800 spectators, and students 
gathered on the hill adjacent to 
the field. Others chose to observe 
from a bird’s-eye view, perched 
atop the neighboring parking 
garage, while young fans rallied 
the crowd in a “Let’s go Oakland” 
chant near the goal line.

They 
came 
expecting 
a 

Grizzlies win. 

Most 
would 
make 
the 

assumption that the Wolverines 
would come out on top, especially 
after they won their 150th game 
in 
program 
history 
against 

Northwestern, 3-0, earlier in 
the week. Michigan holds a 
9-1-4 overall record against the 
Grizzlies, but recent history 
indicates 
that 
visiting 
their 

campus is no easy task.

During their past three visits 

to Rochester, the Wolverines 
have not been able to pull away 
early, resulting in the nail-biter 
finishes Oakland fans have come 
to expect.

With 
all 
three 
previous 

meetings at Oakland Stadium 
extending 
into 
an 
overtime 

period, 
games 
between 
the 

two teams have been anything 
but boring in recent years. The 
record between the in-state foes 
on Grizzly turf remains 1-1-1, and 
the fans, enjoying success against 

the state’s flagship university, 
remember.

The crowd arrived for a show, 

but it was one the Wolverines 
weren’t aware of. 

“(We) don’t know anything 

about the past,” said Michigan 
coach Chaka Daley. “The past is 
gone.”

Michigan took the field with 

this mindset, prepared to earn a 
win regardless of prior results.

The Wolverines were the 

first to hit twine. Freshman 
midfielder Ivo Cerda knocked 
in a header near-post off a short 
cross just over 15 minutes into the 
match.

However, 
the 
Grizzlies 

retaliated quickly, capitalizing on 
a penalty kick opportunity. The 
back-and-forth scoring kept the 
many spectators enthralled.

But first to the ball at the 

start of the second half, the 
Wolverines began to capitalize 
on their shots and took advantage 
of opportunity.

The 
viewers 
remained 

absorbed in the match well into 
the second half, not because it 
was the even game they came 
to watch, but because of the 
numerous scoring chances the 
Wolverines created. With 21 
shots on goal, Michigan kept the 
bystanders on their toes, never 
knowing when they could slip a 
ball into the back of the net.

“If we can live up to the 

standard the team has set, and we 
can live up to that standard every 
single game … we’ll get what we 
deserve out of every single game,” 
Daley said.

 In Mexico, sicario means 
hitman. The trailer for “Sicar-
io” will tell you as much. 
However, 
the trailer 
won’t tell 
you exactly 
what’s going 
on, plot-
wise. Which 
is actu-
ally one of 
its strengths. 
The first official trailer for 
“Sicario” takes you south 
of the border with protago-
nist Emily Blunt (“Edge of 
Tomorrow”), as she becomes 
engaged in the bloody, never-
ending war between drug 
enforcement officers and the 
high rollers of illegal drug 
industry. One such high roller 
appears to be Benicio Del Toro 
(“Snatch”), while Josh Brolin 
(“No Country for Old Men”) 
plays Blunt’s ally.
 The trailer begins with 
the oft-used strobelight 

strategy, flashing bits of the 
film between blank black 
space. While unoriginal, the 
technique works well with 
similarly styled sound effects. 
Intimidating figures, tense, 
unexpected action and a 

Mexican backdrop seem to 
provide a reliable idea of what 
to expect from “Sicario.” For 
what it’s worth, talks of a 
sequel have already begun.

We sent Daily arts writer Danielle 

Raykhinshteyn to the Diag to find out 
what students are wearing for fall. The 
answer? Old standbys with plenty of 
history, thrifted gems and sartorial 

souvenirs from far-off places.

Sean Zhang, 21 — Engineering senior, mechanical engineering:

“I care more about my hair than my clothes, so I’ll keep growing my hair. I like 
keeping this ponytail. I’m not really focused on how I’m going to dress today.”

Anita Ho, 18 — Music, Theatre & Dance freshman, clarinet performance:

“I really like flannel shirts, so I’m planning on going thrifting next weekend with 
my roommate for some flannels. I’m pretty petite, so I’m looking for anything 
that I can tie at the waist or that fits my height.”

Allison Fedler, 18 — LSA freshman, undecided:

“I have a pair of suede, taupe-colored wedges. They’re an ankle boot. They’re 
comfortable, and I like wearing heels because I like being taller than I am. I think 
they look good with a lot of different outfits.”

Brandon Patterson, 28 — Rackham student:

“This leather bag is a bag I got after traveling to India this summer. It reminds 
me of the trip and is just a good bag all around that is pretty versatile. It’s a 
brown bag with magnet clips on the sides and pretty simple in its design, but 
inside there are three pockets, a few zippered ones, and it also holds a laptop, 
which is what I need it for.”

By CAROLINE FILIPS

Daily Arts Writer

From a distance, the world of 

high fashion seems an insular 
realm separate from reality. It 
appears an esoteric bubble, often 
associated 
with 
pretentious 

overtones — a universe inhabited 
by 
inflated 
personalities 
and 

embellished 
veneers 
floating 

within a sea of fabrics.

But a visit to Main Street’s Ayla 

& Co. eschews any preconceived 
notions 
of 
fashion’s 
surreal 

associations. In the theme of 
Ann Arbor’s inviting allure, the 
boutique 
sustains 
a 
genuine, 

unique vibe that the Ayla herself 
established in 1980.

The dynamic Ayla emigrated 

from Turkey with a pioneering 
vision to introduce fashion to Ann 
Arbor. She created her eponymous 
retailer as a space for tree town’s 
fashionably inclined women to 
shop, sip fresh-brewed coffee 
or tea and intermingle among 
exquisite textiles.

“She was a wonderful woman 

with incredible style and an 
incredible 
vision,” 
current 

co-owner Narmeen Gaeta said. 
“She was kind of fearless and always 
ready to try something new.”

Ayla 
transmitted 
that 

captivating 
bravado 
into 
her 

inventory’s signature aesthetic — 
clean and classic, yet distinctive 
— one Gaeta defines as good design 
and high style, but not fashion 
victim-y.

Unfortunately, Ayla succumbed 

to breast cancer just four years 
into her small-business venture. 
Luckily, she left the store in good 
hands with her husband, a former 
shoemaker, and Gaeta, a prior sales 
associate during her time at the 
University. Gaeta’s sister, Nadia 
Sesi joined her on the retail team 
until the duo decided to oversee 

operations 
as 
co-owners 
and 

buyers. The sisters opened as “Ayla 
& Company” in 1989, rebranding 
from the former storefront of 
“Ayla.” Gaeta and Sesi continue to 
preserve Ayla’s magnetic essence, 
but have refashioned as necessary 
through the years. 

“We kept the spirit of it, but 

over the years we’ve elevated the 
quality as the customer base grows 
older,” Gaeta said. “We’ve taken 
the seedling of the idea and made 
it grow and blossom. We’ve put our 
own stamp on it.”

With longevity to boot, the sister 

act has proved successful in Ann 
Arbor’s ever-changing retail scene. 
The secret seems to be an emphasis 
on 
building 
genuine 
rapport 

with their clientele and resisting 
commercialization. Though the 
owners stray from the promotional 
virtues of social media, the shop 
promotes a real, live space for 
likeminded 
connectedness. 
A 

visit to Ayla & Co. feels more like 
a personal shopping appointment 
than a rote retail experience of 
scripted customer service. Regular 
shoppers gossip while poring over 
their specific style selections per 
recommendation of either Gaeta 
or Sesi, with one of the two always 
working the floor.

“We’re service intensive here,” 

Gaeta said. “The customer base 
likes to see us here, and they trust 
our opinions. We’re definitely 
active owners.”

Their collection encompasses 

lifestyle pieces of eveningwear and 
work wear, a majority of which 
are European-designed. The most 
popular sellers range from the 
contemporary designs of Cacharel, 
to the colorful, whimsical Italian 
line 
Maliparmi; 
Michigan-

designed 
b.may 
handbags 

have been a customer-coveted 
item, along with an accessory 
assortment of ornate statement 

jewelry, scarves, shoes and various 
handbags. Though they don’t carry 
big-name designer labels such as 
Lanvin or Chloé; quality remains a 
top priority for Gaeta and Sesi.

“Every season we try to bring in 

new designers,” Gaeta said. “The 
hallmark of our store is that we 
showcase lesser known designers 
that are really, really good. The 
look and the style sensibility is 
similar.”

Keeping up with the fashion 

industry’s rapidity, Gaeta and 
Sesi curate prospective seasonal 
collections 
approximately 
six 

months in advance. Just last week 
Gaeta met with countless retailers 
in New York to assemble the store’s 
spring selection.

“We go and buy the clothing 

and visit showrooms,” Gaeta said. 
“We do attend some trade shows 
because that’s where a lot of new 
designers get their name out.”

It’s clear to see Ayla’s mentality 

resonates with the sisters, as 
they always make a point to seek 
out up-and-coming designers in 
efforts to continually present a 
fresh sartorial assortment.

“You kind of have to risk a 

little bit and try something new,” 
Gaeta said. “That’s how you have 
to be in fashion. It’s very easy to 
stay on a certain track and never 
deviate. Sometimes you have to 
try something new because you 
never know when it will be well-
received.”

It’s a fearless philosophy that’s 

panned out well for the duo. With 
distinguishable sophistication in 
design, Ayla & Co.’s collections 
are multi-generational — Gaeta 
even admitted to selling the 
ombré shift dress seen in this 
issue to both teenage and senior 
patrons. Though far from dated, 
the standout of Ann Arbor’s retail 
landscape endures as a destination 
of accessible high fashion.

Ranking the fall 
fashion editorials

A breakdown of 
seven hundred 
pages of style

By MARA MACLEAN

Daily Arts Writer

As fall approaches, the fashion 

world is abuzz with excitement for 
the coming fashion month and Sep-
tember issues. Each magazine pro-
duces its thickest issue of the year, 
stuffed with advertisements from 
every luxury brand and retailer. 
The product is overwhelming — 700 
pages of gorgeous images and top 
editors all trying to say that jackets 
are important for fall — so we got 
Daily Style Writer Mara Maclean to 
rank them.

5. VANITY FAIR: Though 

Taylor Swift’s cover story was not 
the most jaw-dropping or influ-
ential, her shoot with Mario Tes-
tino captured a different layer of 
strength and beauty that can get 
lost amid the constant #squad ins-
tagrams and red carpet moments. 
The writing was more of a stand-
out in Vanity Fair than in the other 
September issues (as it should be 
for this magazine), which leads 
to its lower ranking. Our rank-
ings are focusing on the quality 
of editorial shoots, and many of 
this issue’s insights weren’t worth 
mentioning. Still a powerful voice 
in fashion, VF was essential to 
include in the top five. There was a 
nice story about Gigi Hadid’s social 
media power, but again, nothing 
truly ground-breaking. 

4. ELLE: Similar to Vogue, Elle 

released The Elle Look, a defini-
tive listing of fashion’s brightest 
stars with their muses. It was fas-
cinating to see who inspires some 
of the greatest talents in the fash-
ion universe. Alexa Chung jumped 
around with Erdem Moralioglu 
and Diane von Furstenberg posed 
with actress Allison Williams 
— it was an interesting take on 
Vogue’s who’s who. Cover star 
Keira Knightley looks out from 
the pages in eye-popping colors in 
her “Everything is Illuminated” 
spread. Paola Kudacki and Holly 
Millea show us just how beautiful, 
talented, well-read, opinionated 
and fashion-forward the actress 
is. Next, Elle walks us through 
fall’s crazy textures — fur, brocade, 
chiffon, lamé (yes!) — in “Road 

to Marrakech.” Like many other 
issues, Elle touched on the bright 
colors and wild prints to come in 
“Mad Max,” highlighting fashions 
turn towards maximalism. Their 
pastel editorial, “Beyond the Pale,” 
just couldn’t compare to the simi-
lar spread seen in Porter. Finally, 
to end on the dopest of notes, Elle 
spotlights the modern woman at 
age 30 for their 30th anniversary. 
Basically a catalogue of every 
power woman, Elle lists every out-
standing comedian, musician, nov-
elist, athlete, actor and politician 
who portray the strength of 30.

3. VOGUE UK: Vogue UK set 

the tone for their September issue 
with another powerful choice in 
cover star — Emma Watson. In 
“Voice of a Generation,” Violet 
Henderson and Josh Olins try to 
capture everything that is Emma 
Watson. The images are soft and 
feminine, while the clothes show 
the strength and powerful voice 
that is synonymous with the UN 
ambassador; the images were just 
as intriguing as the story. Vogue 
UK’s strongest editorial, “Fade 
to Black,” showed the color of fall 
in sculptural silhouettes, crazy 
wools and graphic hardware. The 
stark shots emphasized the inter-
esting shapes and lines that can 
be created with the classic color. 
Immediately following, in “No 
Debutante,” primary colors and 
splashy prints popped off the page 
in an ‘80s shoot. In “The Witching 
Hour,” Vogue UK showed their 
greatest strengths in the portrayal 
of delicate lace and wisps of chif-
fon in dark, eerie shots — a look not 
mentioned by fashion’s other play-
ers. Overall, this issue was solid, 
as always, but not at the editorial 
level of Porter and U.S. Vogue.

2. PORTER: The only reason 

Porter holds the number two spot 
is Vogue’s ability to reach a wider 
audience. Overall, the editorials 
and fashion insights reached an 
entirely new level in Porter’s Fall 
2015 issue. The excellence begins 
with the cover star, Daria Wer-

bowy. Fashion’s favorite rebel, 
known for her incredibly closed 
off personal life and modern femi-
ninity, poses in the most striking 
editorials to date. Mikael Jans-
son captures the supermodel in 
two very different stories — “True 
Grit” and “Soft Focus.” Porter, 
known for its innovation and com-
mitment to the finest production, 
shows Werbowy among the dirt 
and grease, in powerful shapes 
and colors; then, transitions into a 
world of pastels and delicate linge-
rie. The contrast is overwhelming 
and insightful, and Porter claims 
its rightful place as one of the lead-
ing voices in the fashion industry. 
Read on for more glamorous shots 
and sensational editorials, all 
thrown together with incredibly 
well-written cultural and human-
interest pieces.

1. VOGUE U.S.: For anyone 

who has seen “The September 
Issue,” it is clear the Vogue team 
sets an incredibly high standard 
for this particular month’s edi-
tion. September 2015 was the 
greatest example of this constant 
pursuit of excellence. To begin, 
the fashion bible spelled out 
who’s who in the fashion industry 
with “Forces of Fashion.” Over 
a 37-page spread, fashion’s top 
influencers were spelled out from 
Phoebe Philo of Céline, to Uniq-
lo and Novak Djokovic. Vogue 
decreed Victorian influence was 
a fall essential — embroidered flo-
rals and old lace — in a gorgeous 
editorial Hustle & Bustle. The 
standout among the 700+ pages 
was the season’s coat feature, 
“Into the Woods.” One of the most 
stunning editorials ever to be 
published, folkish models roamed 
through a fairy-tale forest. The 
patchwork and bright red coats 
popped against the brilliant blue 
and green mossy background. The 
only small disappointment of the 
entire issue was Beyoncé’s cover 
story. B’s shots were as gorgeous 
as ever, but Margo Jefferson’s 
letter dictating the definition of 
Beyoncé was slightly lackluster. 
Redemption was found, however, 
in the form of exclusive insights 
into lake life with Cindy Crawford 
and her equally beautiful chil-
dren. And to finish on the stron-
gest of notes, the cast of “Empire” 
was shot sporting the most spec-
tacular clothing — reds, silvers, 
sequins and sparkles.

New season 
of ‘Empire’ 
strikes back

By HAILEY MIDDLEBROOK

Daily Arts Writer

In case you haven’t heard, the 

Lyons are back on the prowl. 
And they’re hungrier than ever.

In its own 

right, 
FOX’s 

“Empire” 
hasn’t so much 
changed the TV 
world as it has 
epitomized it — 
soapy glamour, 
sex, 
violence, 

family 
drama, 

banging 
style 

and an on-point 
soundtrack — it’s all there, bold 
and unabashed. At its core, the 
storyline follows Shakespeare’s 
“King Lear:” an aging king, 
Lucious Lyon (Terrence Howard, 
“Iron Man”), must decide which of 
his three sons will inherit his hip-
hop recording kingdom, Empire 
Entertainment. But unlike Lear, 
Lucious is lucid and ruthless — and 
he’ll stop at nothing to preserve his 
Lyon pride. That is, as long as the 
rest of the Lyons agree with him.

Lucious and his family not 

only own Empire, they run the 
damn show. Oldest brother 
Andre (Trai Byers, “Selma”) is 
a Wharton-educated business-
man who is intent on raising 
Empire stock and promoting 
himself to CEO; but his savvy 
is tampered by mental health 

issues and dark secrets, like his 
father’s murder of their cousin, 
Bunkie. Light-hearted Jamal 
(Jussie Smollett, “North”), the 
middle Lyon, was the R&B sen-
sation that put Empire on the 
map; after a season of coming 
in terms with his homophobic 
father, he’s now the CEO of the 
company. Jamal’s good nature 
is often tested by his youngest 
brother, Hakeem (newcomer 
Bryshere Y. Gray), an up-and-
coming rapper and ladies’ man 
with an appetite for cougars — 
including Lucious’s ex-fiance, 
Anika “Boo Boo Kitty” Calhoun 
(newcomer Grace Gealey). 

But as in the animal kingdom, 

the real work isn’t done by the 
alpha male, but rather his leading 
lady. And she knows it. Infamous 
Cookie Lyon (Taraji P. Henson, 
“Person of Interest”), hardened by 
a 17-year prison sentence for drug 
dealing, is back to claim her throne 
in the Empire, with or without her

ex-husband. 

For season two, Cookie and 

Lucious’s 
roles 
are 
flipped: 

Lucious is in jail for murder, while 
Cookie is orchestrating a “Free 
Lucious” concert that’s really 
geared toward winning back 
Empire investors. She’s bank-
ing on Mimi Whiteman (Marisa 
Tomei, “Crazy, Stupid, Love”), a 
rich business mogul who’s smit-
ten with Anika, to sign a $250,000 
check to rocket Empire again — 
but this time, with Cookie right-
fully on top. To her credit, Cookie 
insists that she’s “doing it for fami-
ly,” but her equally power-hungry 
sons see ulterior motives.

Without Lucious in the lead, 

the younger Lyons must grow up 
on their own. Andre and control-
ling wife Rhonda (Kaitlin Dou-
bleday, “Catch Me if You Can”) 
have big news ahead; Jamal is 
accepting his responsibilities as 
a boyfriend and gay rights advo-
cate. Even wild child Hakeem 
is finding his way, ready to drop 
his first album. Conversely, the 
head Lyons — Cookie and Lucious 

— are floundering, as Cookie’s 
power missions fail and Lucious 
is stripped of entitlement behind 
cell walls.

But let’s be real. This is 

“Empire” we’re talking about, 
where a character’s pitfall always 
has a springboard at its base, ready 
for a full-throttle rebound. The 
show’s careful balance of its ele-
ments — of failures and successes, 
horrible violence and heartfelt 
reunion, 
disillusionment 
and 

humor — are what make it pal-
atable. Where season two could 
have faltered with the solved 
case of inheritance, it pushes for-
ward with the multidimensional 
growth of the Lyons.

But as Cookie says: we’re not 

out of the jungle yet. 

The Lyons are 
on the prowl.

The Vogue team 
sets an incredibly 
high standard.
