plans to city fr expansion

New complex would
be built on East
William Street
By DAVID BUCCILLI
For the Daily
Less than a year after opening
its first apartment building, the
Zaragon company is looking to
expand its business by building a
new high-rise next to the original
Cottage Inn Pizza on East Wil-
liam Street.
owners of the original Zara-
gon Place - located on East
University Avenue - intend to
construct a similar apartment
complex at the corner of East
William and Thompson Streets,
according to a public notice sent
last week by the Zaragon com-
pany to residents living within
1,000 feet of the new site.
Zaragon Place 2 will offer
students another opportunity
to lease apartments near Cen-
tral Campus following the "very
successful" first year of Zaragon
Place, Zaragon President and
University alum Richard Perlman
said in an interview.
"The location is perfect. It's a
block from the Diag, very close to
Central Campus," Perlman said.

"ZP1 and ZP2 are approximately
the same distance from the Diag.
One is from the South U. side of
town. One is from the State Street
side of town."
Perlman said the location and
quality of the apartments will
be attractive not only to Univer-
sity students but also University
employees and other Ann Arbor
locals.
Perlman said he couldn't com-
ment on the price range for what
ZP2's apartments might be, but
he said ZP2 will act as the "sister
building" to ZPl, adding that the
design of the building will be very
similar to the existing Zaragon
Place.
The current Zaragon Place
is 10 stories high with 66 apart-
ments and can house up to 248
residents. The average price tag
of a Zaragon Place lease is cur-
rently about $1,000 per month
per person.
According to the public notice,
ZP2 will be 14 stories high with
99 apartment units. Perlman said
the building will be able to house
between 200 and 350 residents.
Similar to Zaragon Place, ZP2
will also feature retail space on
the ground floor, on-site parking
and an in-house gym.

If proposals are
approved, project
would begin in 2011
By LINDSAY KRAMER
Daily StaffReporter
For those who travel from near
and far to get a taste of Zingerman's

famous sandwiches, the dining
experience may get even better.
Zingerman's is awaiting approval
for plans to expand the restau-
rant submitted to the Ann Arbor
Planning Commission last week.
The expansion is expected to cost
between $4 million and $7 million
and restaurant officials say it would
enhance their business and custom-
ers' experiences.

Approval by the Planning Com-
mission is only the first of several
steps for the restaurant in getting
the expansion project underway,
said Paul Saginaw, co-founder of
Zingerman's.
If Zingerman's receives approval
from the Planning Commission, it
will then have to secure a loan for
the project, followed by approval
from the Historic District Commis-

sion, according to Saginaw.
In 2008, when Zingerman's pre-
viously applied to begin the expan-
sion process, its efforts were halted
when the commission decided that
the expansion would impede on the
historical preservation of the Ker-
rytown area.

construction during the spring of

'U' profs. predict improvement
for Washtenaw County economy

Economic report
says recovery could
begin in some
industries this year
By LINDSAY KRAMER
Daily StaffReporter
The third quarter of 2008 rocked
the country and Washtenaw Coun-
ty, with huge economic declines
p followed by some of the worst
unemployment rates in history.
However, George Fulton, direc-
tor of the University's Research
Seminar in Quantitative Economics,
and Donald Grimes, senior research
associate at the University's Insti-
tute for Research on Labor, Employ-
ment, and the Economy, predict a
road to recovery for Washtenaw
County that starts for some indus-
tries in 2010 but will not begin to be
felt by others until 2012.
Last week, Fulton and Grimes
released a 40-page report called the
Economic Outlook for Washtenaw
County in 2010 to 2012. The two
University researchers have created
this economic outlook for the coun-
ty each year for the last 25 years. But
amid the state's and country's cur-
rent economic climate, this year's
report was much anticipated.
Grimes said the report evaluates
the changing economy and provides
information on what industries will
best recover from the current reces-

sion. Based on this year's findings,
Grimes said Washtenaw County has
a hopeful economic future.
"It's good news in the sense that
the county's economy is beginning
to grow again in terms of jobs,"
Grimes said. "We think it started
growing in the first quarter of this
year and will continue to grow at a
pretty good pace, not a great pace,
but it'll be pickingup pace in the sec-
ond half of 2011 and then into 2012
it'll be pretty healthy."
Washtenaw County's economic
decline started in the early 2000s,
because at that time the county
started experiencing significant job
losses. The pattern reflected the suf-
ficient job losses from Michigan's
automotive industry.
According to the report, ebbs in
the health of the auto industry play
alargerole inthe county's economic
position. Automotive jobs made up
11.1 percent of the county's employ-
ment in 1990, but by 2012, they are
expected to represent only 1.8 per-
cent of county jobs.
In 1999, the county's unemploy-
ment rate was 1.6 percent and has
consistently risen every year since.
In Grimes and Fulton's economic
evaluation of last year, they under
predicted the employment rate for
2009 and said unemployment was
going to rise from 5.9 percent to 8.2
percent. Instead, it reached 8.8 per-
cent.
Though the current national
unemployment rate stands at 9.7
percent, the report projects that it

In light of six recent suicide
attempts at Cornell University,

some have questioned whether
higher education officials are
doing enough to prevent suicide
on college campuses.
According to national statistics
on the University's Counseling
and Psychological Services web-
site, suicide is the second leading
cause of death among college stu-
dents. About 1,100 students com-
mit suicide nationwide each year

and CAPS officials say the Uni-
versity is determined to help this
number decline.
In order to accomplish this,
there are numerous on-cam-

that are committed to mental
health issues. CAPS, University

Electing to take classes
pass/fail may be a standard
scheduling procedure for
current students, but a 1972
proposal to change LSA
policy to allow University
students to take any course
"pass/no entry" was initially
seen as a radical change.
The system - proposed to
the LSA Curriculum Com-
mittee in 1972 - would give
LSA students three different
options in the grading sys-
tem. Students would have the
choice of using the traditional
letter grade system, the new
pass/fail choice and an option
to combine the two with a
mandatory teacher evalua-1
tion, according to an April 11,
1972 Michigan Daily article.
The proposal followed the

)erior' grading option

Oberlin College, which were
already employing the pass/
fail gradingsystem, according
to the article. The University's
Residential College was also
already using this system in
nearly all of its courses at the
time.
Faculty members told the
Daily at the time that the pro-
posed grading system would
be "totally superior" to the
traditional system that was
currently being used.
Though the proposal was
passed in the Curriculum
Committee meeting and was
gaining support, the system
was then placed under review
by LSA's Executive Commit-
tee, LSA faculty and the Uni-
versity's Board of Regents.
The vote in the Curriculum
Committee reflected the con-
tentious nature of the system,

only passing by a vote of four to
three, according to the article.
Opponents of the proposal
like Daniel Longone, a profes-
sor at the University, didn't
think the new grading system
would be widely accepted.
Longone told the Daily
at the time that "its accep-
tance (is) unlikely," but that
the plan is also "comfort-
able because of the options it
allows."
The proposal faced other
battles within the University
community because other
groups were also pushing
for grading revisions. The
Curriculum Committee
expressed concerns regard-
ing the amount of propos-
als being presented to the
University at the time and
said this could threaten the
chances of passing the new

grading proposal.
Supporters of pass/fail
grading, including University
students, continued to be con-
fident the proposal would pass.
This is "the best plan that's
been proposed," student John
Lande told the Daily at the
time.
Supporters of the propos-
al said they believed that if
the chances of failing a class
were narrowed by providing
the pass/fail option, students
would strive harder to suc-
ceed academically, according
to the article.
The pass/fail system is a
"good proposal that strikes
a middle ground between
keeping things the same and
creating sweeping changes,"
English told the Daily at the
time.

Michigan film tax credit
program gets mixed reviews

Two years after law
passed, 89 movies and
TV shows produced
LANSING, Mich. (AP) - Mich-
igan's bid to become a star in the
movie business is drawing mixed
reviews.
Two years into one of the most
generous tax incentive programs
in the nation, the state has lured
some big-name productions, from
"Gran Torino" with Clint East-
wood to portions of "Up in the
Air" with George Clooney.
Since the measure became law
on April 7, 2008, 89 movie or TV
productions have been completed.
Hotels, caterers and others get-
ting some spin-off business can't
wait for the industry to expand.

But some lawmakers are ques-
tioning whether Michigan is get-
ting its money's worth.
The tax credit program is pro-
jected to cost the state nearly $69
million for projects completed
in 2009, not counting incentives
given for permanent infrastruc-
ture projects, according to the
Michigan Film Office. The poten-
tial annual bill is higher - more
than $100 million - but some
projects weren't finished and
won't get the tax credits.
A few lawmakers would prefer
to use part of the tax incentive
cash to help fill in a state budget
shortfall of at least $1.5 billion
headed into the fiscal year start-
ing Oct. 1. Other detractors say
the jobs created are just tempo-
rary.
Janet Lockwood, director of

the Michigan Film Office, dis-
agrees with the program's critics.
She says Michigan's film indus-
try is already contributing to the
state's economy and will become
an even bigger player.
"You have to remember, we're
still building a whole new indus-
try in the state of Michigan,"
Lockwood said. "It's going to take
some time to evolve. We all know
that. But I believe this program is
working."
. Michigan allows companies
to file for tax credits worth up
to 42 percent of a film's produc-
tion costs. Sixty-two of the 126
companies that applied in 2009
were approved for the credits, the
state's film office said. Industry
expenditures were estimated at
nearly $224 million last year, up
from $125 million in 2008.

BERLIN TOWNSHIP, Mich.
Detroit River refuge
gets 35 more acres
of land to expand
The Detroit River International

wetlands and land used for farming
over the past 30 years.
The property is home to great

ment the property 28 miles
southwest of Detroit will benefit
wildlife and area residents.
Agricultural portions of the land
will be returned to prairie and

WASHINGTON
US hopes to ease
Russia's fears on
missile defense
Secretary of State Hillary Rod-
ham Clinton says the U.S. will con-
tinue to try to seek common ground
with Russia on missile defense
despite the Kremlin's fear that such
systems are aimed at crippling its
nuclear arsenal.
She told a Pentagon briefing she
understands reservations being
voiced by Moscow about a new
nuclear arms reduction treaty to be
signed later this week.
Russia unsuccessfully sought to
include limits on missile defenses

during months of negotiations on
the new arms treaty and yesterday
said it reserves the right to with-
draw from the pact if it deems U.S.
missile defense systems in Europe
as a threat.
QUITO, Ecuador
Writers at Ecuador
state paper claim
censorship
Twenty columnists and con-
tributors to the Ecuadorean state
newspaper El Telegrafo said yes-
terday they will no longer write for
the paper because of alleged cen-
sorship.
In a signed letter sent to media
outlets, the writers said they were
quitting to protest "acts of censor-
ship and the violation of the rights
of free expression and press free-
dom."
In recent weeks, El Telegrafo's
director and sections editor were
removed from their posts and the
deputy director resigned amid a
disagreement with management
over the direction the newspaper
was headed.
El Telegrafo was a private news-
paper until three years ago when it
was taken over by the government
amid debts and legal problems.
On April 1, a note from manage-
ment directed that the newspaper's
editorial section not publish "com-
mentaries, strategic information
and other strictly internal informa-
tion" written by the columnists and

Obama calls nuclear
terrorism top threat

White house aims to
limit international
threat and conflict
WASHINGTON (AP) - Rewrit-
ing America's nuclear strategy, the
WhiteHouseyesterdayannounced
a fundamental shift that calls the
spread of atomic weapons to rogue
states or terrorists a worse threat
than the nuclear Armageddon
feared during the Cold War.
The Obama administration
is suddenly moving on multiple
fronts with a goal of limiting the
threat of a catastrophic interna-
tional conflict, although it's not
yet clear how far and how fast the
rest of the world is ready to fol-
low.
In releasing the results of an
in-depth nuclear strategy review,
President Barack Obama said his
administration would narrow the
circumstances in which the U.S.
might launch a nuclear strike, that
it would forgo the development of

new nuclear warheads and would
seek even deeper reductions in
American and Russian arsenals.
His defense secretary, Robert
Gates, said the focus would now be
on terror groups such as al-Qaida
as well as North Korea's nuclear
buildup and Iran's nuclear ambi-
tions.
"For the first time, prevent-
ing nuclear proliferation and
nuclear terrorism is now at
the top of America's nuclear
agenda," Obama said, distanc-
ing his administration from the
decades-long U.S. focus on arms
competition with Russia and on
the threat posed by nuclear mis-
siles on hair-trigger alert.
"The greatest threat to U.S.
and global security is no lon-
ger a nuclear exchange between
nations, but nuclear terrorism by
violent extremists and nuclear
proliferation to an increasing
number of states," he said, spell-
ing out the core theme of the new
strategy.
Obama's announcement set the

stage for his trip to Prague Thurs-
day to sign a new arms reduction
agreement with Russia. And it pre-
cedes a gathering in Washington
next Monday of government lead-
ers from more than 40 countries
to discuss improving safeguards
against terrorists acquiring nucle-
ar bombs.
In May, the White House will
once again help lead the call for dis-
armament at the United Nations in
New York during an international
conference on strengthening the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Congressional Democrats
hailed yesterday's announce-
ment, but some Republicans
said it could weaken the nation's
defense.
Rep. Buck McKeon of Califor-
nia, the top Republican on the
House Armed Services Commit-
tee, said the policy change could
carry "clear consequences" for
security and he was troubled by
"some of the language and per-
ceived signals imbedded" in the
policy.

ern California, the state's disaster
management chief was thousands
of miles away in Chile, examin-
ing what experts say is the best
case study yet for how a truly cata-
strophic earthquake could impact
the United States.
Chile and the U.S. Pacific coast
have more in common than their
geology; they share advanced con-
struction codes, bustling coastal
cities, modern skyscrapers and vet-
eran emergency services.
These were all put to the test
in Chile, which despite its exten-
sive planning lost 432 lives in the
8.8-magnitude earthquake and
resulting tsunami - lessons that
California, Oregon and Washing-
ton have yet to fully learn despite
deepexperiencewithlesserquakes.
They include: Coastal flood
maps mean nothing without local
enforcement. Hospitals need to
not only stay upright but also stay
open. Stringent building standards
require stringent inspections. And
tourists need to be taught about the
dangers of tsunamis, which caused
the greatest loss of life in Chile, wip-
ing out seaside campgrounds on the
last weekend of summer vacation.
"People living there know that
when the earth shakes, it's like an
alarm going off: Get out. But visi-
tors aren't conditioned like that,"
said Matthew Bettenhausen, the
secretary of California's Emergen-

cy Management Agency.
Most of Chile's modern build-
ings emerged with little more than
broken plaster, but there were some
spectacular failures among recent-
ly built structures. Some experts
blame code violations that lax
inspections failed to catch.
"It's not enough to have a good
law - you have to follow it," says
Rodolfo Saragoni, the University of
Chile's top seismic engineer.
Chileans who lost their homes
are asking how building firms got
away with cuttingcorners.
"I've never made walls this thin
for this kind of building," said civil
engineer Carolina Astorga, show-
ing the AP the damaged founda-
tions of her 19-story apartment
building in Santiago.
She moved in a month before the
quake. Now the building is sunken,
leaning and uninhabitable.
"They save more rebar, more
money and it comes out cheaper
for the contractor. But here are the
consequences."
Code enforcement in California,
asinChile,fallstolocalgovernments.
Some are sticklers, but others are
essentially "paper building depart-
ments, where they're pushing paper
but not actually rigorously enforcing
building codes," said Fred Turner, a
structural engineer with the state's
Seismic Safety Commission.
"I'm afraid there are a few juris-
dictions in California that are prob-
ably not much better," Turner added.
Likewise, the tsunami responsi-
ble for most of Chile's death toll was
perfectly predictable from official
flood maps published on the navy's
Web site. But the coastal cities dev-
astated by the waves did nothingftor
incorporate the charts in public
planning.

Toyota issues
internal repairs-
procedures

Pope Benedict XVI blesses a child during Palm Sunday mass in St. Peter's square at the Vatican on Sunday. The Pope opened
Holy Week on Sunday amid one of the most serious crises facing the church in decades.
Vatican speaks out agalns
anti -Catholic 'hate' campain

Pope targeted for
opposing abortion,
same-sex marriage
VATICAN CITY (AP) - The
Vatican heatedly defended Pope
Benedict XVI yesterday, claim-
ing accusations that he helped
cover up the actions of pedophile
priests are part of an anti-Catho-
lic "hate" campaign targeting the
pope for his opposition to abor-
tion and same-sex marriage.
Vatican Radio broadcast com-
ments by two senior cardinals
explaining "the motive for these
attacks" on the pope and the Vati-
can newspaper chipped in with
spirited comments from another
top cardinal.
"The pope defends life and
the family, based on marriage
between a man and a woman, in a
world in which powerful lobbies
would like to impose a completely
different" agenda, Spanish Car-
dinal Julian Herranz, head of the
disciplinary commission for Holy
See officials, said on the radio.
Herranz didn't identify the
lobbies but "defense of life" is
Vatican shorthand for anti-abor-
tion efforts.
Also arguing that Benedict's
promotion of conservative fam-
ily models had provoked the so-
called attacks was the Vatican's

dean of the College of Cardinal',
Angelo Sodano.
"By now, it's a cultural con-
trast," Sodano told the Vatican
newspaper L'Osservatore Roma-
no. "The pope embodies moral
truths that aren't accepted, and
so, the shortcomings and errors
of priests are used as weapons
against the church."
Also rallying to Benedict's side
was Italian Cardinal Giovanni
Lajolo, who heads the Vatican
City State's governing apparatus.
The pope "has done all that he
could have" against sex abuse by
clergy of minors, Lajolo said on
Vatican radio, decrying what he
described as a campaign of "hatred
against the Catholic church."
Rev. Rebecca Voelkel, a Minne-
apolis, Minnesota-based minister
in the United Church of Christ
who is faith work director of the
National Gay and Lesbian Task
Force, described the cardinals'
comments as "diversionary coun-
terattacks" that are an affront
both to the victims of clergy
abuse and to gays and lesbians.
"It makes me heartsick," she
said.
Sex abuse allegations, as well
as accusations of cover-ups by
diocesan bishops and Vatican offi-
cials, have swept across Europe
in recent weeks. Benedict has
been criticized for not halting the
actions of abusive priests when he

was a Vatican cardinal and earlier
while he was the archbishop of
Munich in his native Germany.
The mainland European scan-
dals - in Germany, Italy, Austria,
Denmark and Switzerland - are
erupting after decades of abuse
cases in the United States, Can-
ada, Australia, Ireland and other
areas.
In Germany, nearly 2,700
people called the church's sex-
ual abuse hot line in the first
three days it was operating, a
Catholic church spokesman said
yesterday.A team of psychologists
and other experts have spoken
with 394 people so far, ranging
from several minutes up to an
hour, Trier Diocese spokesman
Stephan Kronenburg said.
"Most callers reported cases of
sexual abuse," he told The Associ-
ated Press.
Benedict has ignored victims'
demands that he accept respon-
sibility for what they say is his
own personal and institutional
responsibility for failing to swift-
ly kick abusive priests out of the
priesthood, or at least keep them
away from children.
But he has been protected by a
vanguard of senior Vatican prel-
ates who are fending off what
they contend is an orchestrated
attempt to attack the leader of the
world's more than 1 billion Catho-
lics.

Documents: Toyota
lagged in issuing US
warnings
WASHINGTON (AP) - Toyota
issued internal repair procedures to
its own distributors in 31 European
countries about sticking accelera-
tor pedals months before it warned
U.S. regulators about the problem
- and on the same day it told the
U.S. government it would conduct a
recall over loose floor mats, accord-
ing to Toyota documents obtained
yesterday by The Associated Press.
Transportation Secretary Ray
LaHood earlier this week cited
the Sept. 29 European warn-
ings in his decision to assess a
record $16.4 million fine on the
Japanese automaker for failing to
alert the U.S. government to its
safety problems quickly enough.
LaHood on yesterday said Toyota
made a "huge mistake" by not dis-
closing safety problems with gas
pedals on some of its most popu-
lar models sooner.
Detailed chronologies provided
by Toyota to the government and
obtained by the AP show rising
concerns at the end of 2009 about
sticking gas pedals and complaints
from Toyota owners in the U.S.
about the problem. According to
the documents, Toyota's European
division issued technical informa-
tion to the European distributors
"identifying a production improve-
ment and repair procedure to
address complaints by customers
in those countries of sticking accel-
erator pedals, sudden rpm increase
and/or sudden vehicle accelera-
tion."
On the same day, Toyota told the
National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration of its decision to
recall several Toyota and Lexus
vehicle models "to address the risk
of accelerator pedal entrapment
by all-weather floor mats," accord-
ing to a timeline of the company's
handling of the floor mat recall.
The two timelines, entitled "pre-
liminary chronology of principal
events," were provided to the gov-
ernment on March 24.
Toyota has said the problems
involved separate issues and in the
case of the sticking gas pedals, the
problem was related to the buildup
of condensation on sliding surfaces
in the accelerator system that helps

drivers push down or release the
gas pedal.
The documents obtained by
AP were among 70,000 pages of
papers turned over to government
investigators. They detail internal
communications and testing of
the sticking pedals before Toyota
presented its findings to NHTSA
four months later, during a meet-
ing in Washington on Jan. 19. Two
days later, Toyota announced it
would recall 2.3 million vehicles to
address the sticking pedals.
On Oct. 7, according to the time-
line, a staff member of Toyota's
productplanning and management
division at the company's head-
quarters in Japan sent a Toyota
colleague in North America a copy
of engineering change instruc-
tions describing the same design
changes for the accelerator pedal of
a Toyota RAV4 as was implemented.
in Europe.
Two weeks later, the timeline
says a member of the product
planning team in North America
received a call from a colleague
in Japan "instructing him not to
implement the (engineeringchange:
instructions) noted above."
Toyota notified NHTSA in
November 2009 of three cases of
sticking pedals in Corollas sold in
the United States that were report-;
ed to the company in late Octo-
ber. In November and December,
Toyota engineers examined pedals.
from the Corollas and "concluded
that the phenomenon experienced
in the United States was essentially
the same as the phenomenon expe-
rienced in Europe."
In mid-January, Toyota held,
internal meetings "to discussstatus
of production changes and to pre-
pare for meetings with NHTSA" on
Jan. 19, according to the timeline.
LaHood told reporters in Chica-
go on Tuesday that he wouldn't be
surprised if a review of documents
from Toyota Motor Corp. uncov-
ered additional safety lapses by the
Japanese automaker.
"This is the first thing that we'
have found. It may not be the last
thing," LaHood said, addingthat "it
would not surprise me if we discov-
ered other information."
Under federal law, automakers
must notify the National High-
way Traffic Safety Administration
within five days of determiningthat
a safety defect exists and promptly,
conduct a recall.

Efficient emissions
Automakers must adapt to new EPA regulations
Clean air doesn't need to be expensive. And it won't be under
new federal regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. Last
week, the Environmental Protection Agency, in response
to a directive by the Obama administration, unveiled new federal
rules that would limit emissions and set more stringent fuel econ-
omy standards for cars and trucks starting in 2016. The regula-
tions are expected to save the consumer about $4,000 in gasoline
expenditures over the lifetime of a new vehicle. But more impor-
tantly, they are essential to the preservation of the environment.
Automakers should work aggressively to meet the long-overdue
standards by the government's deadline.

Banned discussion

On Thursday, the EPA and the U.S.
Department of Transportation released a
new set of regulations that would be the first
restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions
from automobiles and the largest increase in
fuel economy standards since their inception
in 1970. Under the new emissions standards,
passenger vehicle fleets are expected to aver-
age 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016. Automo-
bile greenhouse gas emissions are expected
to fall 21 percent below current projected
levels by 2030 with the new regulation.
The new rules are crucial for the preser-
vation of the environment. The U.S. is one
of the largest polluters of greenhouse gases
in the world. And vehicles account for one-
fifth of American emissions, according to
an Apr. 1 editorial by The New York Times.
These emissions contribute to global warm-
ing by trapping heat inside the planet's
atmosphere and raising the temperature
of the earth. By restricting the amount of
these gases that are released into the atmo-
sphere through vehicle emissions, the gov-
ernment has demonstrated its commitment
to combat climate change. This will help set
a global standard and curb the damage of
global warming and pollution.
Higher fuel economy standards will help
Americans save money. Like many environ-
mentally friendly initiatives, the initial cost
will be recouped in savings later on. The

initial cost of new vehicles will increase by
an EPA-estimated $985 for 2016 models,
but buyers will save around $4,000 on fuel
expenses in the long term, as reported in an
Apr. 2 Washington Post article. Spending
less on gas will leave consumers with more
disposable income to spend in other parts of
the economy.
This move was a necessary one for the
Obama administration. It set boundaries
for an industry known for prioritizing prof-
its over the environment. Automakers have,
until recently, been loath to respond to the
rising demand for more fuel-efficient cars.
But the vice president ofthe Alliance of Auto-
mobile Manufacturers, Gloria Berquist, has
called the new requirement a "roadmap for
future fuel-economy increases." While it's
encouraging that automakers are on board
with the new regulations, the rules should
be seen as a guide for the future development
of the automotive industry.
The new regulations will lower green-
house gas emissions that are dangerous for
the environment, and come with.the bonus
of saving consumers money. Automakers
must show their dedication to a cleaner
environment and their patrons by work-
ing diligently to meet4he new regulations
by 2016. And the Obama administration
should continue to ensure proper enforce-
ment of the regulations.

've learned much in the two
weeks since my letter to the Uni-
versity's president (Dear Presi-
dent Coleman...,
03/25/2010). First,
I learned that Uni-
versity President
Mary Sue Cole-
man believes she's
my mother. Or at -
least she wants to
be. And who could
blame her? Just
look at that black ALEX
and white thumb-
nail photo. But she RILES
also wants to be
your mother. Cole-
man thinks she knows what's best for
our health, even though most of us
are competent adults capable of mak-
ing decisions and dealing with conse-
quences.
She's also a negligent mother to
the campus community. I attempted
to contact the University president
on numerous occasions, only to be
turned down every time. E-mail after
e-mail, I found it hard to believe that
I couldn't receive a 30-second reply
from Coleman, even if it was only
to shut me up. Every attempt was
followed by a response from some
member of the University's massive
bureaucracy directing me to some
other bureaucratic agency.
Our president's disregard calls into
question her priorities. It amazes me
that President Barack Obama has
directly reached out and written per-
sonal letters to citizens more than our
University president has addressed
student concerns. And although
Obama is certainly no Coleman, I'm
sure the man has a few things on his
plate - a health care bill to pay for,
two inherited wars and the largest
debt in American history, for starters.
This is merely a microcosm of
-the lack of transparency, absence of
student input and complete indif-
ference the University has shown to
the campus community in regard to

the smoking ban. The Smoke-Free
Initiative Steering Committee hasn't
granted the public any information on
its meetings. Not to mention that the
University hasn't ruled out develop-
ing a database to track students who
fail to adhere to the ban, according to
a Nov.12 Smoke-Free Initiative infor-
mation session. The steering commit-
tee ironically asked for student input
at two farcical "listening sessions"
yet refused to reconsider any part of
the initiative, despite being offered
common sense alternatives, like more
pronounced enforcement of the cur-
rent ban, the establishment of smok-
ing zones or a vote by the University
community.
Granted, some of Coleman's rea-
sons for the Smoke-Free Initiative
are likely motivated by good inten-
tions like lowering the University's
health care costs. But these justifica-
tions are severely compromised by
her compensation from a corporation
that will likely benefit from the smok-
ing ban. Coleman sits on the board
of directors for Johnson & John-
son, from which she earned nearly a
quarter of a million dollars in 2009,
and holds 11,159 shares of common
stock, 10,777 shares of common stock
equivalent units and 7,600 exercis-
able stock options in the company.
Johnson & Johnson is the producer
of a host of nicotine replacement
products, including Nicoderm and
Nicorette. Coleman explains, "the
University will offer free behavioral
sessions and selected over-the-coun-
ter smoking cessation products to
faculty and staff, along with co-pay
reductions for prescription tobacco
cessation medicines (and) discounts
on tobacco cessation aids."
In other words, under the proposed
Smoke-Free Initiative, the Univer-
sity would subsidize products made
by Johnson & Johnson. The Univer-
sity would purchase more nicotine
replacement products, likely resulting
in financial gains for Johnson & John-
son and, consequently, Coleman.

Another thing I've realized is that
most people I talk to are against the
smoking ban. This is particularly true
after I explain what the ban specifi-
cally entails. I've managed to convert
at least a dozen individuals who pre-
viously favored the ban with sweet
reason. When I explain to them that
it's an issue of individual choice, per-
sonal responsibility, lack of transpar-
ency and an unenforceable means
for the University administration to
claim campus is "smoke-free" and
continue to wave its twisted banner
of political correctness, they listen.
The smoking ban
shouldn't be only
Coleman's choice.

4

Our time at the University should
be spent embracing the privileges
and responsibilities of adulthood, not
avoiding them. In spite of Coleman's
negligence, she wants me to believe
that she's entitled to hold my hand
and protect me from her perceived
dangers of the real world. Coleman
can't continue to ignore the fact
that 1,373 students, faculty and staff
have signed a petition opposing the
smoking ban since Apr. 1. As a presi-
dent who claimed to be receptive to
"input from the campus community"
and "ensuring that the needs of our
University's varied constituents are
understood," she has failed dismally,
neglecting to take into account stu-
dent input and allow for communica-
tion between the administration and
campus community. Before Coleman
tries to force any "culture of health"
on us, she should address her own
culture of conflicting interests.

Gold's 'Worship' cartoon
makes offensive comparison
TO THE DAILY:
Daniel Gold's cartoon is such a pitiful com-
mentary to see for one of Christianity's holi-
est times (Weekend of worship, 04/02/2010).
Remembering that Jesus Christ died on a cross
and rose to life offering the gift of eternal life
to those who believe in him, comparing Good
Friday and the story of redemption with Hash
Bash and the story of human depravity and self-
worship, is an offensive comparison. Calling it a
weekend of worship and making the connection
between worshipping God on Good Friday and
worshipping something other than God for the
so-called great Hash Bash Saturday, through
a play on words, comes across as a cheap hit
at something and Someone many of us hold as
sacred. Jesus died for the sins of the world -
and what happens during Hash Bash proves that
the world needs to be saved.

U should compromise by
selling smoking permits
TO THE DAILY:
In recent weeks, Daily columnists Rob-
ert Soave and Alex Biles have condemned the
University's campus-wide smoking ban as an
assault on personal liberty (Coleman's smok-
ing gun, 04/06/2010, Dear President Coleman...,
03/25/2010).
Though I agree that the ban is illiberal and
paternalistic, it also seems unfair that non-smok-
ers mustpay higher health care costs to subsidize
smokers' poor decisions. Instead of issuing an
outright ban on smoking, the University should
sell on-campus smoking permits. With a nation-
ally renowned public health school, the Universi-
ty should be able to estimate how much smoking
would increase an individual's health care costs
over the period of a semester, and this would be
the cost of a permit. Purchasers of the permit
would be able to smoke in designated areas on
campus and could present their permit to any
DPS officer. Anyone smoking on campus without
a permit would receive a sizable fine, the fees of
which would go toward administrative costs for
the program.
The selling of permits is preferable to both the
upcoming ban and the status quo. Though the
ban will restrict personal liberty, not having a

ban forces responsible, intelligent people to indi-
rectly bankroll smokers by paying higher health
care costs. Issuing permits would allow individ-
uals to make personal decisions, but would also
put the onus on them to pay forthe consequences.

Ban prote
from secoi
TO THE DAILY:

cts non-smokers
nd hand smoke

As debate on the campus-wide smoking ban
heats up, Daily columnists Alex Biles and Robert
Soave have added to the discussion (Dear Presi-
dent Coleman..., 03/25/2010, Coleman's smoking
gun, 04/06/2010). Soave has questioned Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman's allegiance to Johnson
& Johnson, among other corporations. I would
like to take the time to tell you why I fully sup-
port the smoking ban.
Soave and Biles have ignored the fact that
smoking is terrible for everyone involved. As a
student going into the health care field, I see the
burden smoking puts on society and health care
facilities on a daily basis. The Environmental
Protection Agency published a report in 2008
outlining the burden smoking places on society,
citing 440,000 preventable deaths and $150 bil-
lion in health care costs annually.
Some people, including Biles and the College
Libertarians, have also argued that the ban is
an infringement on personal rights, stating they
have the "right" to smoke. I would argue that
they have no right to make me inhale second
hand smoke, thus putting me at risk for health
related problems later in life. The EPA and Cen-
ters for Disease Control have said that second
hand smoke contains more than 4,000 chemi-
cal compounds, including ammonia and carbon
monoxide, a poison to the human body. Second
hand smoke has also been classified as a carcino-
gen, or cancer causing agent, since 1992.
As a non-smoking student, I continually am
upset by walking into a bar (a public place) or
simply down the sidewalk and being engulfed
by someone's second hand smoke. Second hand
smoke causes coughing, phlegm, chest discom-
fort and reduced lung function in non smokers,
not to mention the need for a shower. It's one
thing if you want to smoke the cancer stick on
your own, it's another if you make me. So the
next time you're walking on campus and you get
a whiff of smoke, think of Coleman and the poli-
cies protecting students livinga healthy lifestyle.

Nursing senior

recently heard someone remark
that the U.S. school system -
specifically elite private schools
and public schools
for gifted stu-
dents - operates
on a model that
demands a high
level of perfor-
mance but not
necessarily a high
level of learning.
I am inclined not
only to think this BRITTANY
is true but also to
assert that this is SMITH
one of the major
problems in Amer-
ican education deserves immediate
attention.
Schoolchildren today are pushed to
be the ultimate Renaissance students
- acquiring book smarts, making con-
tributions to their communities, taking
up athletics if playing an instrument is
not an option and demonstrating lead-
ership outside of the classroom. I ques-
tion these measures of meritocracy. I
am concerned that schools are send-
ing a superficial message to students
"to do more." I am concerned that
"doing more" doesn't actually increase
the depth of education, even if it does
improve applications.
I remember the days of pulling
all-nighters in high school, studying
late nights for my Advanced Place-
ment classes, going to Borders to buy
books to prepare for the AP exams and
searching for ways to raise my GPA
a few decimal points. But now that I
reflect on my high school years - spe-
cifically, my junior and senior years -
I can acknowledge that the desire tobe
the best student academically induced
anxiety and, consequently, extracur-
ricular activities didn't concern me as
much. Institutions of higher learning
and now selective high schools have
created an admissions process that
only adds to this pressure by using
standardized tests as gatekeepers.

But I am critical of schools that use
standardized test scores as indica-
tors of a student's ability to thrive in
his or her school. A standardized test
measures a student's test-taking skills
and not that students' comprehension
of the material. Though widely used,
test scores are a superficial means of
assessing a student.
I seethis probleminnewlyproposed
federal standards as well. As much as
I love President Barack Obama and
his policies, I suspect that the stan-
dards created for his Race to the Top
program, an initiative in which states
compete for financial support from the
federal government, may merit a posi-
tion in "Race to Nowhere" - the name
of a documentary film that spells out
the problems of pressuring youth to be
high-achievers. In "Politics and Pars-
nips: Obama's Common Core," Susan
Ohanian of The New York Times
details the requirements that states
like Michigan have to meet to compete
for funds under Race to the Top.
According to Ohanian, in order for.
states to be eligible for aid, they must
commit to the Common Core Stan-
dards document, which contains the
Exemplar Text list as an appendix.
According to Ohanian, the Exemplar
Text includes books like Jane Austen's
"Pride and Prejudice" as required
reading for the an eleventh grader
and William Wordsworth's "Preface
to Lyrical Ballads" for a ninth grader.
Obama wants students to have a firm
grasp of a variety of classical litera-
ture. Though I understand that many
of the titles on the Exemplar Text list
demand high performance from stu-
dents, I am not sure how much stu-
dents will actually benefit since the
list is so extensive.
Obama's Race to the Top program
encourages the overachiever mental-
ity that has contributed to the stress
of high school students vying for
limited seats in the nation's top-tier
institutions. Obama's policy is con-
nected to the cultural issue of over-

working our children in the name
of academic rigor. Or is the aim of
Obama's policy for American stu-
dents to be exposed to the breadth of
classical literature and not necessar-
ily its depth? That would be another
example of embracing a superficial
standard of education. It pushes stu-
dents to know and do more but not
necessarily to learn more.

Our culture
is too focused
on grades.

4

Colleges and universities have an
image of a high-performing student
that expensive private schools and
competitive public schools strive to
produce. More often than not, this
standard doesn't promise the engage-
ment of the student's learning and
understanding of material. But it is
daunting and creates a high-stress
environment that leads students to
equate how successful they are with
the prestige of the high school, col-
lege or university to which they are
admitted.
But it's not the fault of the stu-
dent, parent or even Obama that
this environment exists. Instead,
the problem is the culture that has
been created with the permission
of parents, schools and the govern-
ment. This culture needs to change.
As remarked by a contributor of
the documentary film, "The Race
to Nowhere," if the United States is
going to "get off this treadmill" of
measuring greatness by test scores,
then "we're going to have to get off of
it together."

couldn't be more blunt.
"I think it sounds like a Broken
Social Scene record," he said sim-
ply.
Forgiveness Rock Record - a title
that's maybe as ironic as it is direct
- found its name fairly early in the
recording process.
"It's something that Kevin
(Drew) was kicking around and
proposed early on. ... Somehow it
seemed appropriate," Peroff said.
Peroff has his own interpreta-
tion of what the new album signi-
fies, tying its blunt title to more
immediate concerns.
"Records, maybe ours in par-
ticular, are kind of like love letters,"
Peroff explained. "In any love letter
you can sort of allude to forgiveness
in a way. I think there's a lot going
on in the world right now, there's
a lot going on in everyone's lives -
this is the forgiveness rock record."
This summer, the band will
play a string of shows in both
the United States and Europe,
playing outdoor festivals like the
Sasquatch! Music Festival and
Barcelona's Primavera Sound
Festival in May.
"All I know is that I'm going
from Spain to America in 48 hours
with two shows to play," Peroff
said. "There's some crazy stuff in
the future, for sure."
Broken Social Scene will be
playing the Michigan Theater

available from $16.50.

Though Shame, Shame

remain dependent on their pitch-
perfect harmonies and clangorous
recordingsound to keep their own

on its own.
The record kicks off with
"Stranger," an immediate display
of co-lead singer Toby Leaman's
sharp-shooting pop instincts.
This is Dr. Dog at its best, with a
spare drumbeat and guitar riff
that leads into a swelling chorus
of harmonies. Leaman may sing,
"I do believe / that there's no
more tricks up my sleeve," but we
already know better than that.
The album's lead single "Shad-
ow People" starts out innocently
with Scott McMicken's unusual
helium-infused scratchy vocals
backed by only an acoustic guitar.
Slowly but surely, the song cre-
scendos as he demands, "Where
did all the shadow people go?"
McMicken sends the song into a
barrage of honky-tonk piano in
a devilishly danceable beat that
wouldn't sound out of place in a
saloon.
Still, you can't delve too far into

Eryka"'h converts back

Television this terrible
might as well be a crime

By LINDSAY HURD
Daily Arts Writer
A gripping crime scene epic
that involves
murder, weap-
ons, manhunts
and broken The F ve
families seems
like a recipe for Chronides
an entertaining Thursdays
show. But some-
how A&E turns atlO p.m.
this foolproof A&E
formula into use-
less and corny programming with
"The Fugitive Chronicles."
A&E's latest spin on the crime
scene show reenacts infamous
manhunts from the past using
actors and interviews with cops.
The show tells the story from the
criminal's point of view using a
voiceover from the actor playing
the criminal. A&E presents this
"inside look" into the mind of the
criminal in order to offer a fresh
perspective on cop shows.
However, with lines like "I'm
the tiger who lingers back and
r forth in the cage" and "I'm just
an original country boy," it seems
like the writer for "The Fugitive
Chronicles" needed to let out
some superfluous creativity into
these "true" stories. Add in the
melodramatic suspense music,

obnoxiously placed commercial
breaks and a jump cut from a cop
getting shot to kids making pizza,
and A&E has got itself a cheesy
crime show that's obviously des-
perate to stand out.
Besides the tacky voices, the so-
called evil fugitive from the pilot
wasn't a notorious serial killer
or a legendary terrorist. Instead,
he was just some mullet-repping
hick named Bucky, wanted for
attempting to kill three cops after
he escaped from jail. Are there
really no other fugitive cases in all
of the U.S. this show could cover?
While the fugitive in this story
did make it to the FBI's Ten Most
Wanted list, it was only because he
hid out in the woods for 156 days
and the cops couldn't find him.
Even after he was captured, the
cops even admitted that good ol'
Buckylooked ill and weak and they
couldn't believe this was the man
who was causing so much terror.
What's worse for the drama is
that he surrendered. Instead of
the big showdown that had been
advertised, Bucky just gave up.
The show is promoted as "grip-
ping" because it tells tales of infa-
mous manhunts. But really, all it
gives you is some deadbeat dude
who camped out in the woods for
half a year. There's nothing grip-
ping about it.

Needless to say, A&E might
want to spend its time chronicling
stories its viewers actually want to
watch. With the endless amounts
of crime scene and cop shows
that television offers, the network
should realize that it doesn't need
the melodramatic effects to get
attention. "Unsolved Mysteries"
and "America's Most Wanted" are
so successful because the crime
stories are entertaining and excit-
ing - not because they use gim-
micky sound effects.
Stilted writing
and boring
criminals mar
A&E's latest.
If you're looking to veg out
by watching a cop show, any old
episode of "CSI" that you've seen
a thousand times would be far
more entertaining than listening
to some batty writer try to sound
like a rough and tough criminal.
About the only entertainment in
"The Fugitive Chronicles" comes
from a few good laughs at its
corny attempt to be relevant.

of its ending. the Ankh)
During three Universal Motown
minutes of walk-
ing in Dallas,
Texan's Dealey Plaza, Badu gradu-
ally strips naked, coming to a halt
before she buckles and collapses,
recalling John F. Kennedy's assas-
sination. After a brief spoken
monologue, the camera focuses on
a new figure: a shining, braided,
Bitches' Brew-styled goddess. As
sunlight floods the lens, the god-
dess rushes forward.
Billed as the conclusion of a
two-part sequence, Return of the
Ankh is the sequel to 2008's New
Amerykah Part One (4th World
War). War, which was hailed as
a muscular collection of pro-
test songs, brought Badu the
most acclaim and attention she'd
received since her Grammy-win-
ning debut, 1997's Baduizm. Cut-
ting closer to that album's cloth
than War, Ankh is an assortment
of loose and organic funk, without
the politics. With a title borrowed
from the drug-film classic "Holy
Mountain," introspective lyrics
and a little bit of nudity, Return of
the Ankh is all about rebirth.
Beginning with the spare and
angular "20 Feet Tall," Badu even
sounds naked. Next to a light echo
and percussive keyboards, you can
actually hear the creaking of her
piano bench. From there, Ankh's
first half plays with a great sense
of sequence. Following "Tall" is

ZARAGON
From Page 1A
on ZP2 can start, the city's zon-
ing ordinance requires Zaragon to
submit a petition for construction.
"The petition has not been sub-
mitted," said Alexis DiLeo, city
planner of Ann Arbor's Planning
and Development Services. "One
of the requirements before sub-
mitting (a petition) is to invite citi-
zens to discuss petitions and see
what kind of feedback they have."
Zaragon will host its Citizen
Participation Public Meeting on
Monday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. in
the Michigan Union to discuss
building Zaragon Place 2.
According to the public notice,
after the public meeting Zaragon
can submit a petition for construc-
tion to be reviewed by the Plan-
ning Commission and the Ann
Arbor City Council - a process
that is expected to last through
mid-August.
But after all the proper approv-
als are given, it could still take two
years to build Zaragon Place 2,
Perlman said.
"The construction will take
between 18 and 24 months," Perl-
man said.
Bill Res, a manager of Cottage
Inn, said he supports the new con-
struction project to take place next
door to the pizzeria.

"In general, there's no concern,"
Res said. "If anything, it'll bring in
more business."
Res added that the new con-
struction will also rid the area of
an eyesore.
"It will get rid of the mess we
have right next to us," Res said.
"(It's) not much to look at right
now."
First-year MBA student Renee
Lau, a current resident of Zara-
gon Place, said she doesn't think
the quality of the loft-style apart-
ments at Zaragon Place is worth
the price.
"I can hear everything going
on in the rooms around me. It's
expensive. I'm kind of surprised,"
Lau said.
Lau said the quality doesn't
really justify the price, adding that
not all the bedrooms in her apart-
ment even have windows. Howev-
er, she said the location of Zaragon
Place is extremely convenient.
Business School junior Ben
Ryan, who also lives in Zaragon,
said he was mainly attracted to the
apartment because of its location.
"(The location is) very conve-
nient for business students," Ryan
said. "It has a lot of Greek life and
a lot of business students."
Ryanadded, "It's definitely
expensive, hut if you value the
benefits of location and the qual-
ity of living enough, it's definitely
worth it."

Residents flee their homes after a 7.7 magnitude earthquake in Banda Aceh on Sumatra island, Indonesia earlier today.
7.7 agntde earthquake
shakes SmtrIdonesia


Quake prompts brief
tsunami warning,
reports of injuries
JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)
- A 7.7 earthquake shook Indo-
nesia's northwest island of
Sumatra early today, prompt-
ing a brief tsunami warning and
sending residents rushing for
higher ground. There were scat-
tered reports of injuries, but only
minor damage was reported in
most areas.
The quake struck at 5:15 a.m.
(2215 GMT) and was centered 125
miles (205 kilometers) northwest
of the coastal town of Sibolga in
Sumatra at a depth of 19 miles (31
kilometers), the U.S. Geological
Survey said. It had earlier said
the quake measured 7.8.
Indonesia's Meteorology and
Geophysics Agency and the
Pacific Tsunami Warning Cen-
ter in Honolulu issued tsunami
wprnings following the quake,

but lifted them two hours later.
A hospital on Simeulue island
off the coast of Sumatra admit-
ted 17 people for treatment of
injuries sustained .in the quake,
including four in critical condi-
tion, said Capt. Ajas Siagian, a
deputy police chief for the area.
Abdul Karim, a government
spokesman in Simeulue, said
dozens of houses collapsed or
were damaged in Teupah Selatan
village. He said no larger build-
ings were reported damaged, but
electricity had been knocked out
on the island.
"We are still collecting reports
of damages and injuries ... but the
situation has returned to normal
and people are going back home,"
he said.
Fauzi, a seismologist at the
meteorology agency, said the
quake would have "at least
caused cracks in many buildings
and houses, especially in areas
closest to the epicenter."
"That'swhy we are still try-
ing to get data of damage in

some remote areas that remain
difficult to reach due to lack of
communication and blackout,"
said Fauzi, who goes by only one
name.
Local network Metro TV
reported that a dormitory for
nurses partially collapsed in
Aceh's Singkil district and one
woman suffered minor inju-
ries in the rush to get out of the
building. It said fires sparked by
the quake had burned at least 14
houses in Medan, the capital city
of North Sumatra province.
At least five strong aftershocks
measuring up to 5.2 were record-
ed, the meteorology agency said.
The quake, which struck as
people in the region were pre-
paring for morning prayers,
caused panic in Medan, about
135 miles (215 kilometers) from
the epicenter, and other cities
in the region. Electricity was
cut in Medan, Banda Aceh - the
provincial capital of Aceh - and
other areas.
People in several cities along

the southeastern coast of Suma-
tra as well as Sinabang on Simeu-
lue island and Gunung Sitoli on
nearby Nias island poured into
the streets and rushed to higher
ground after the quake.
"Rumors about a tsunami pan-
icked villagers living near the
beach," said Eddy Effendi, a resi-
dent on Nias island. "They ran
away on motorbikes and cars or
by climbing the hills. There was
panic and chaos everywhere,
but I don't see serious damage or
injuries in my village."
Residents in Sibolga said the
shaking lasted more than a min-
ute and utility poles in the area
were knocked down.
The quake was felt as far away
as the outskirts of Malaysia's
Kuala Lumpur, about 320 miles
(515 kilometers) away. There
were no reports of damage there.
A 2004 tsunami triggered by
a magnitude-9.2 earthquake in
the same part of Indonesia killed
230,000 people in a dozen coun-
tries on the Indian Ocean basin.

"It was never made to endure the

still have fewer jobs than it had at
the end of 2008.
"It's going to be sort of a slow
turnaround, but hiring will be turn-
ing around in the next few months
both nationally and locally," Grimes
said. "It'll build up speed a little bit,
and then there might be a bit of a
pause at the end of 2010, beginning
of 2011, butby the middle of the year
we think things will be recovering
in terms of hiring."
According to the report, Washt-
enaw County's unemployment rate
has been consistently lower than
both the state and national averages.
In 2009, Michigan had an average
unemployment rate of 13.6 percent,
while the nation had an average rate
of 9.3 percent.
In 2009, Washtenaw County lost
5,858 jobs, and for the first time
since 2002, the county had fewer job
losses compared tothe nation.How-
ever, the Economic Outlook predicts
that only 66 jobs are expected to be

Ultimately, the expansion would
include the construction of a new
building that would encompass
10,000 square feet over two floors,
with the buildings connected by an
atrium. The outside ofthenew build-
ing would be a brick veneer in order
to blend with the other buildings in
the Kerrytown area, Saginaw said.
"We would like to have ground

lic, more storage space and more
working space for our employees, so
we are providing the Zingerman's

more seating," Saginaw said.
Saginaw said the company hopes
the expansion will turn a greater
profit.
"We hope to double our revenue in
10 years," he said.
At a meeting for Ann Arbor resi-

Despite the economic rebound,
not all industries will see a rise in

rants are expected to continue to

"Things that are really much

In the report, Grimes and Ful-

together over the last few years to
develop broad-based and multi-
dimensional services for all stu-
dents.
MHWG was established in
2001 by Royster Harper, the Uni-
versity's vice president for student
affairs, after the tragic death of
a University student. The group
brings together mental health
professionals and organizations
on campus, as well as the greater
community, to provide mental
health services for students. Since
2008, its main focus has been to
develop better communication
between services across campus.
Todd Sevig, CAPS director and
MHWG chair, said the University
started a campus-wide initiative
in2001 to promote suicide preven-
tion but efforts have increased in
the last few years.
"Really in the last three years
we've taken a very aggressive
stance on suicide prevention, to be
more active, to be more out there
and to really get the message out
that we don't want any students to
die by suicide," Sevig said.
Sevig said the key to bettering
mental health services is listening
to students' needs and providing
them with accessible services and
various educational tools.
"We are trying to literally reach

Seventh Avenue and 34th Street.
Another man was hit in the ankle
in an unrelated shooting and a
woman and hit with a BB gun
during the mayhem Sunday and
Monday morning. Police were still
investigating those incidents.
Police said hundreds of young
people spilled into midtown Man-
hattan near Times Square early
Monday in what has become a rau-
cous annual ritual on the weekend
of the New York International Auto
Show. Police Commissioner Ray-
mond Kelly said Tuesday that some
of those involved this year skipped
the auto show altogether and head-
ed straight for Times Square.
According to court documents
every person, be it faculty, staff
and students," Sevig said. "That
is our goal. That's our shared
vision."
One suicide prevention pro-
gram offered by CAPS is called
Question, Persuade, Refer - an
in-person workshop for Universi-
ty students, faculty and staff that
trains people to recognize symp-
toms of mental illness and how
to react if a student or colleague
shows warning signs of suicide.
The program, which has assisted
approximately 3,000 people on
campus thus far, is the most direct
way to decrease the stigma asso-
ciated with mental illness, Sevig
said.
Another resource that is com-
mitted to helping students in
distress includes the MHWG
website, which offers students
a place to find available services
and encourages family, friends,
faculty and staff to take action if
they know someone in need.
On the CAPS website there are
three video resources, created
by the CAPS Student Advisory
Board, that teach students how to
make their first appointments at
CAPS, how to initiate conversa-
tions with professors for help and
how to assist a friend in need.
Sevig said resources like
MHWG and CAPS are excellent
for providing assistance, but peo-
ple on campus need to take more
active measures to prevent future

released Tuesday, people arrested
sprained a police officer's wrist,
hurled bottles at one another and
at least one knife had a knife dur-
ing the brawl.
One man curled his hands into
fists and cursed at officers, anoth-
er refused to move out of the way
as a sergeant tried to investigate
one of the shootings, and other
defendants blocked sidewalks
and streets, according to police
accounts that emerged as at least
21 of some 33 people arrested were
arraigned.
Plea and bail information
wasn't immediately available.
The charges mainly included
disorderly conduct and resisting
tragedies.
"It's great to have all the aware-
ness," Sevig said. "But I think we
are beyond awareness. I think we
need tools; we need to connect
when this is happening right now
to here's what I need to do."
Robert Winfield, director of
UHS and chief health officer for
the University, said though there
are many resources for students
on campus, sometimes the stu-
dents are "just too immobilized by
their depression," and they do not
reach out for help.
"While there are a lot of options,
we, as a society, don't know how
to reach out to people," Winfield
said. "We don't know how to get to
those people because part of their
illness is isolation, so it's a kind of
catch-22. It's very hard for those
people to reach out, so this is a
real dilemma, and we don't really
know what to do."
According to MiTalk - a web-
site for University students seek-
ing mental health resources - 11.3
percent of University students in
Ann Arbor reported in a survey
that they had thought of attempt-
ing suicide at least once during
an academic year. In addition, 1.1
percent reported that they had
actually attempted suicide at least
once.
The Big Ten Student Suicide
study conducted approximately
15 years ago is the only scientific
research that has focused on col-

arrest, though some defendants
faced other charges ranging from
assault to marijuana possession.
None of those arraigned was
charged in the shootings, which
wounded a man and three women.
Besides the 33 arrested, anoth-
er 23 were released after getting
summonses or juvenile reports.
The yearly ruckus has spurred
stabbings and dozens of arrests
before, but Monday's mayhem
brought more arrests and gained
more attention than usual. It
came amid concerns about an
uptick in murders, felony assaults
and rapes in the first quarter of
this year after several years of
historic lows.
lege student suicides. According
to the study, out of 100,000 college
students in the Big Ten, 7.5 stu-
dents commit suicide each year.
Though Sevig was not able to
provide the exact number of sui-
cides on the University's campus,
he said the University is slightly
below the national average for
student deaths by suicide. Howev-
er, based on annual University and
American College Health Asso-
ciation surveys, Sevig said a high
number of students report signs of
distress and thoughts of suicide.
Sevig added that there needs to
be more scientific research that
looks at mental illnesses and the
precursors that provoke suicide
attempts.
Currently, the University, along
with the other schools in the Big
Ten, is participating in a study
that is analyzing suicide among
college students from 2000 to
2010. The goal is to understand
what is happening from a system-
atic point of view in order to know
where to focus prevention efforts.
Sevig said he hopes the Uni-
versity's campaign efforts to "do
something to help yourself and do
something to help a friend" will
ultimately provide the resources
students need in times of crisis.
"We've really been trying to
push this community of caring,
web of support, and do something
even if you don't know exactly
what to do," he said.

At this point in the year,
much of the Michigan
baseball season has seen
the Wolverines simply going
through the motions.
Yes, they
have managed CAITLIN
to compete SMITH
with a moder-
ately difficult On Baseball
schedule. And
Michigan (2-1
Big Ten, 15-10 overall) is cur-
rently tied for first in the Big
Ten after its opening weekend
against Indiana.
But those good numbers have
disguised a mediocre overall per-
formance.
Michigan fans have been
forced to hear the same old
excuse: pitching and batting
weren't working in unison.
The Wolverines have had their
moments - sweeping Indiana-
Purdue Fort Wayne and holding
off a late comeback run from
Eastern Michigan - but the
toughest competition is yet to
come.
Against Indiana this past
weekend, Michigan batters
knocked around the Hoosiers'
pitchers to win the first two
games.
But when looking for the cru-
cial, final game sweep on Sunday,
the Wolverines gave up 26 sloppy
runs - the most allowed by a
Michigan team since a loss to
Minnesota in 2001. And on top
of that, an 11-run Indiana rally
in the fourth inning marked the
most runs tallied in one inning
against the Wolverines since
1984.
After a game like that, the
Wolverines are in need of a mid-
season spark.
And hopefully junior out-
fielder Ryan LaMarre, who was
injured in late February against
Texas Tech, can provide exactly
that.
In the 2009 season, LaMarre
started in 53 games, leading the

team with a.344 batting average,
55 runs scored and 62 RBIs.
He was also second team
All-Big Ten Outfielder, third
team All-American to Baseball
America and the NCBWA. He
has the ability to give new life to
a lethargic offense and provide
the team with needed in-game
leadership.
LaMarre has missed 18 games
this season due to a broken
thumb.
His long-awaited return to
game action came last Friday
against Indiana as a pinch run-
ner, when LaMarre stole a base
and scored Michigan's 10th run
of the game.
Michigan fans are hoping that
he will fully return into the line-
up this weekend against Purdue.
He has the talent to impact
games in many ways, with his
speed, defense and hitting in the
top of the lineup.
While fans shouldn't expect
to simply see the "Ryan LaMarre
Show," they might witness an
overall boost in team perfor-
mance.
Since Michigan has endured
more than a month's worth of
play without LaMarre, it has
become a stronger team. Team-
mates like senior second base-
men Mike Kittle and redshirt
sophomore first baseman Garrett
Stephens have stepped it up to fill
his cleats, soto speak.
With a reliable swing and solid
fielding skills, LaMarre should be
able to fill in the gaps where con-
sistency between pitching and
hitting has been lagging. This
will give the rest of the team the
opportunity to support him on
the field and improve their play
as well.
Only time will tell if LaMarre
can return rejuvenated after his
injury.
His presence is much needed
but the beginning of his return
might not be just another walk in
the park.

of Robinson's development. "I
think he understands our concepts
pretty well. ... We really worked
hard on his fundamentals, and he
still has a ways to go. But he's a tal-
ented, talented guy and he loves to
play. He's one of those guys that's
very explosive. You got to have an
opportunity for him to touch the
ball, and obviously if you're quar-
terback, you're going to touch it
every snap."
Whoever plays quarterback next
season will be charged with tak-
ing better care of the ball. Michi-
gan had 29 fumbles as a team last
year and lost 13 of those to the
other team. In Rodriguez's offense,
which features a quarterback who
is able to run the ball, limiting fum-
bles is key.
Normally at this time in the
spring, Rodriguez has his quar-
terbacks wearing a different color
jersey to avoid contact. But to make
sure that his quarterbacks avoid
costly turnovers when running
with the ball, Rodriguez has the
quarterbacks in full-contact drills.
"It was a major issue for us last
year, all year, and particularly at
that position," Rodriguez said of
the fumbles. "We've got to make
sure that they know how to take
care of the football in traffic and
they can have the proper ball secu-
rity. And the only way to do that is
to get tackled. If the only time you

get tackled is in a game, then you
worry about do they truly grasp it."
Takinga couple of extra hits now
may also help someone like Gard-
ner learn quickly how important it
is to hold onto the ball.
"He carries it out there a little bit
like he's running along in the sand-
lot," Rodriguez said, extending his
right arm out to mimic carrying
the ball away from his body. "Some-
times when you're a young guy and
you're in the open field, you feel the
freedom to carry the ball out there.
Whenyou get to this level, the guys
chasing you are a little bit faster."
Gardner is still behind the other
two sophomore quarterbacks, due
in large part to a lack of experience.
But as of now, Rodriguez assures
that the race is wide open.
Gardner has progressed during
the first eight practices this spring
in Rodriguez's eyes. But Rodri-
guez is careful to point out that it
is unfair to put too high of expec-
tations on Gardner too early in his
career as a Wolverine.
Rodriguez is certainly lookingto
improve upon the 15 interceptions
the quarterbacks threw as a group
last season as well as the fumbling
problem.
"We can't beat ourselves, I
know I said that plenty of times
last year, but I think we'll have a
better football team," Rodriguez
said. "But we're not going to have
a good enough team to beat our-
selves with turnovers and negative
yardage play. So that's been a huge
emphasis for us this spring limiting
turnovers and as many negatively
yardage plays as possible."

Triple-threat Nemitz
proves her versatility


UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
SUSTAINABI.f Y

By CASANDRA PAGNI
Daily Sports Writer
A softball team that fires on all
cylinders - offense, defense and
pitching - will always be tough
to beat.
But senior Nikki Nemitz, a hit-
ting pitcher for the Wolverines, is
showing that she can dominate all
three phases on her own.
Nemitz was named this week's
Big Ten Pitcher of the Week after
throwing a one-hitter on Sunday
against Wisconsin. And while
the senior was dominant on the
mound, her 3-for-5 weekend
performance at the plate earned
some recognition as well.
"(Michigan coach Carol
Hutchins) always says hitting is
contagious," Nemitz said. "If you
have momentum, if you're feeling
good on one side of the ball, then
you're absolutely feeling good on
the other side of the ball.
"I don't think pitchers have
it any different. Anyone can
have that same feeling, because
if you're fielding really well or
pitching really well, you're going
to translate that to the plate."
As a hitting pitcher, Nemitz
has seen action from the bat-
ter's box in 26 games this season,
while starting 13 games from the
mound. Boasting a .294 batting
average and a 1.85 ERA, Nemitz
has helped her team in countless
ways already this year.
"That's why I love softball,"
Nemitz said after the Wolverines'
trip to Louisville in mid-March.
"I love being a hitting pitcher. I
get to help myself and contribute
to the team on both ends of the
game."
The lefty has settled in nicely to
the newly renovated Alumni Field
during Michigan's recent four-
game home stand, going .545 at
the plate while logging two wins
on the mound during that stretch.
In the Wolverines' home open-
er against Bowling Green, Nemitz
was both the starting pitcher and
the offensive spark, as she mus-
cled out a grand slam in the bot-
tom of the fifth inning to propel
Michigan to a 10-2 victory.
"Every hit is awesome," Nemitz
said after the game. "I got my

pitch, and it felt perfect off the
bat. I was seeing it well, andI was
confident. It's always a nice feel-
ing to hit it hard and hit it over
the fence anyway. That time,
there just happened to be three
of my teammates on base. I can't
really hit a grand slam without my
team."
A St. Claire Shores native,
Nemitz was recruited primar-
ily as a pitcher. Hutchins knew
there was pop in her bat as well
and gave Nemitz an opportunity
to hit during her freshman and
sophomore seasons. But the focus
remained on consistently improv-
ing her pitching game.
"I chose to be a pitcher because
I couldn't handle not being in con-
trol of the game," Nemitz said.
"I like that. Pitchers like to be in
control of situations, otherwise
we wouldn't pitch. I mean, we're
the ones that touch the ball the
most on the field. I like the feeling
of being able to help myself. When
I hit the ball, I obviously help my
own cause and that's fun. But I
also realize that I'm one of nine
hitters."
With pitching as her priority,
Nemitz has posted stellar num-
bers on the mound over her three-
plus years as a Wolverine. Last
season, as a junior, Nemitz was
named the Big Ten Pitcher of the
Year and an National Fastpitch
Coaches Association All Ameri-
can pitcher. Last season she went
28-7 with a 1.07 ERA while setting
career highs in wins, strikeouts,
and opponent averages.
But Nemitz also brought her
offensive game to a new level last
season, as she averaged .294 with
eight home runs and 37 RBI from
the batter's box-all career highs.
While her numbers last year
will be tough to beat, as a senior,
Nemitz is stating her case for the
Big Ten and All American awards
once again. As a three-time All
Big Ten first team selection-as a
pitcher in 2007 and 2009 and as
a utility player in 2008- Nemitz
is intent on staying on top of her
game.
If she continues to find success
in all three phases, Nemitz can
certainly end her Michigan career
with a bang.

PERSONALSTATEMENT

GRAPPLING WITH SILENCE
BY SCOTT ELLSWORTH

Like many new teachers, I am
constantly seeking ways to get
my students to engage with the
material and to bringthe problems of
the real world into the often-artifi-
cial confines of the classroom.
Here at the University, where I
teach a course called "Crime, Race,
and the Law," I've had an easy time
of it. My students are bright, alert
and open to new ideas. But during
the winter 2009 semester, they also
learned an unexpected lesson, one
they are not likely to soon forget.
In my classes, my students and I
grapple with the complex ways that
race impacts the nation's criminal
justice system. And two semesters
ago, we enlisted the help of a number
of guest speakers, including a federal
prosecutor, a retired judge, aparole
officer and a trio of public defenders.
But none of our visitors had been as
eagerly awaited as our last scheduled
guest, a young man known as Anto-

nio Phelps.
A minor character in "Getting
Ghost," Luke Bergmann's book about
African-American drug dealers in
Detroit, Antonio grew up along the
grim streets of the city's west side, a
poverty-ravaged moonscape of single
family homes and vacant lots, shut-
tered schools and shattered dreams.
In a city whose public school sys-
tem graduates less than'half of its
students, Antonio had started deal-
ing drugs by his thirteenth birthday,
and by the time he turned twenty-
one, he had been in and out of both
juvenile lock-up and adult prison.
Free once again, Antonio had been
looking forward to his upcomingvisit
to Ann Arbor. But as it turned out, he
wouldn't be coming after all.
Like many newly released ex-con-
victs, Antonio had found his previous
lifestyle to be either too alluring, or,
in a city where unemployment hov-
ers at around 30 percent and jobs for

cides in Detroit, Antonio's murder
will likely never be officially solved
- a chilling reality that the city's
overwhelmingly African-American
population is all too familiar with.
But white Detroiters living in the
suburbs, on the other hand, probably
won't hear of it at all. In the subur-

fallen out of public discourse. Despite
the fact that homicide is still the lead-
ing cause of death for black boys and
men between the ages of 10 and 24
in the United States, we, as a nation,
have turned our heads the other way.
Consumed by other problems, we now
have other things on our mind.
My students certainly do. With the
semester winding down, and signs
of spring finally starting to appear
across campus, they have already
started turning their thoughts to
graduation and summer jobs, law
school and spring football.
But a late young drug dealer
named Antonio Phelps - someone
that my students had read about but
will never meet - will leave them
with one final tutorial, an object les-
son about how the nation sometimes
responds to some of its most intrac-
table problems.
It's called silence. E

ACTIVISM
From Page 5B
new forms speaks well of the tremen-
dous dedicationofstudents torightthe
wrongs of the world they live in.
Today, the spirit of the 60s activ-
ists lives on within dozens of
campus organizations dedi-
cated to peace, racial equality, gender
equality, immigrant rights, gay rights,
civil liberties, social justice, environ-
mental justice and drug legalization.
But one group that specifically chan-
nels the community-organizing core
of activism is the University's School
of Social Work. The fact that activ-
ism is now practiced and preached in
University classrooms is just one more
positive developmentsince the '60s.
"We are a profession with a code of
ethics," said Liz Gonzales, a graduate
student in the School of Social Work
who helped organize the confer-
ence. "Meet people where they're at,
empowerment, choice."
For Gonzales, being a social worker

means listening to people, finding out
what's keeping them down and fixing
it.
"You need to sit with a person and
hear their story, hear what's going on,
hear how systems are holding them
back from moving forward, from being
successful," Gonzales said.
Such an approach would certainly
please Haber, who still believes that
listening to each other is the only way
to end all the violence and exploitation,
from the wars inthe Middle East tothe
wars in our own hearts.
"You won't make peace without a
meeting," said Haber. "If we're going
to have peace in our little part of real-
ity, what are the questions that have
to be resolved? What are the prin-
ciples of resolution that bring justice
and restore what has been out of bal-
ance, and makes you at the end feel
like everyone has come out better?
The whole war system has to be dealt
with."
Haber is still working to facilitate
these meetings. His dream is to hold
a gathering in Meggido, Israel - the
location of the Christian apocalypse as

described in the Book of Revelations
- where he hopes to preempt the war
to end all wars with a peace to prevent
all wars. As for his home town of Ann
Arbor, Haber is working to bring the
city community and the student popu-
lation closertogether, especiallyon the
issue of the Ann Arbor Public Library's
now defunct parking lot, which he
hopes to transform into a common
area.
The face of activism may have
changed. It is of course the very nature
of radicals tobe excited for the future
rather than clingtothe past. But Haber
and his friends are still warriors for
peace, justice and equality. His words
for the conference attendees were
short and simple, yet elegant and apro-
pos. In so many ways, he still epitomiz-
es the burning passion and undying
dreamof the student activist. ,
"I hope you all will be part of the
choice for the new society rather than
the quiescenceof ratifying the old soci-
ety," he said.
With student activism still growing,
he won't have to worry about that any-
time soon.

MESKO
From Page 7B
to instill the importance of edu-
cation for her son and to this day,
Mesko works hard on his school-
work, making time for his studies
despite having to juggle football and
academics.
"During exam weeks, I would
have group meetings or study with
friends until two in the morning ...
and then I (had) to wake up at five in
the morning to go to a 6 a.m. work-
out," he said. "Investment bankers,
they work 100-plus hours a week
but they're sitting at their comput-
er. I'm running and lifting weights
with the same amount of sleep."
If he does end up in the business
world, Mesko said he would most
likely work for a consulting firm or
something in the financial district,
and maybe eventually start his own
business. He also keeps the option
open of potentially working around
his football career.
NOW, MESKO HAS a chance
to be an NFL punter or, if he choos-
es, to enter into the business world.
Either way, he's ready for both.

The first time Carr saw Mesko
punt, he knew there was something
different about the kid.
"What I knew was, this guy had
incredible potential and guys like
him don't come along every day,"
Carr said. "It didn't take long to
see that he was also very dedicated.
When he didn't have a good punt it
bothered him. He had a great pride
in being the best. In my judgment,
he had all the intangibles in addi-
tion to the great physical ability."
Though the road to Mesko's cur-
rent life may have been tough at
times, he and his family can look
back on their struggles in Romania
and smile, knowing things are bet-
ter now.
Michael and Elizabeth made
a decision to come to the United
States for their son, and he's made
the most of his parents' sacrifice.
"Their willingness, just leave
their whole family behind and pack
up for a whole new life, a lot of it was
for Zoltan so he would have more
opportunities in his life," North said.
"It's a great story and you see Zoltan
knows that it's such a chance that
he's in this situation that I think he
really does everything he can in his
life to seize that opportunity." 0

TH EJUNKD RAWER
random student interview

Hey Taryn, this is Trevor
Calero from The Michigan
Daily. How are you doing?
I'm good how are you?
Good. Taryn, so what are you
doing here at the University.
What's your deal?
tam planning on majoring in cellular
and molecular biology.
So, what does that mean?
Um ... I'm hoping to someday become
a science researcher.
What's your dreamjob?
To work for a genetics company that
would allow me to make dinosaurs
real, like in "Jurassic Park."
[Laughs] I don't know if that's pos-
sible, Taryn.
It's not. But it's a dream.
Yeah I guess dreams don't have to
be real. So are you doing anything
this summer in terms of genetic
research or anything?
I am not. I'm justworking the regular
old summer job.
Yeah? Where are you working?
I work at Pacsun. At Somerset Mall.
So you're really hip, right?

Oh, I'm so trendy. It's ridiculous.
How did you get the job?
I walked into the store and I asked if
they were accepting applications and
the manager told me she'd give me an
interview on the spot.
And so you got the job right there
that day?
No. I had to wait, like, a week. But it
was the first job I ever tried to get.
Taryn, how do you do it? You don't
know how many jobs I've applied
for and have not even gotten a call
back. And you get one on the spot.
I know, I know. I couldn't believe it
either. But you gotta justbe confident
when you walk in, and really friendly.
OK.
And polite and dress the part.
What's the part for Pacsun?
For Pacsun? Um ... just, like, cute,
trendy. You know, hair done.
Oh. And confidence.
Smiling. Confident. They like that.
I'll keep that in mind next tme Im
try to get ajob.
[Laughs] Yep.
So have you always wanted to

work at Pacsun?
Well ... retail is sort of just an easy
summer job. Not very demanding, not
really longhours...
And it doesn't take much to learn
how to do it.
No. Not at all. If you can fold a shirt
and press buttons on a computer
you're good to go.
Do you get free clothes and stuff?
Not free, but we geta pretty good dis-
count.
Can you get me a really good dis-
count on Pacsun wear?
[Laughs] I could, but I would get fired
for that.
[Laughs] You don't have to tell.
Don't you get, like, a friends and
family discount?
No.
Not even family?
No.
Just personal?
I mean, if I'm buying it for someone.
Oh. Like a present.
Yeah.
Well my birthday is a long ways
away.

[Laughs] That's too bad. I'm sorry.
Is your closet just decked in, what
is it, what do they sell there, like,
Quicksilver and...
Fox.
And Roxy?
[Laughs] I do have a lot of stuff from
there just because clothes are expen-
sive and when you're paying for them
yourself on a Pacsun wage ... you can't
really afford ..'
I would never work at aretailstore
if I didn't want to wear the clothes.
Yeah.
So, if you could work anywhere in
Somerset, where would itbe? Any-
where: north side, south side?
Oh gosh. If I could work anywhere .".
There is a right answer to this you
know.
I would work at Tiffany's because you
get to look at fancy jewelry all day,
and it's not busy. There's no cleanup
at the end of the night. You just get to
close and go home right away.

evenbother asking for a discount.

TS RARE TO find Zoltan Mesko with-
out a smile on his face these days.
Ask anyone who knows him - his family,
teammates, current and former coaches or any
of his classmates in the Ross School of Busi-
ness. They'll all agree.
But for Mesko - Michigan's all-time leader
in total punts and punt-yardage - life hasn't
always been something to smile about.
Mesko was born in Timisoara, Romania, a
town of about 300,000 on the westernmost tip
of the country, during a time of great turmoil.
The country had been under communist con-
trol for more than 40 years, and anger against
the regime had sparked an outright rebellion.
Mesko even recalls having to dodge bullets
with his parents.
"For the kids, life was very tough," said
Michael, Mesko's father. "The food was very
limited. The gasoline was also limited. To play
a game, a ball game, you have the streets and
one ball for many families."
Despite the hardships, Michael and Eliza-
beth - Mesko's mother - tried their best to
provide for their son, sacrificing much for him.
"For growth for Zoltan, milk (was) very
important," Michael said. "I needed to go very
early in the morning (to wait in) line when the
store was opening because maybe other people
got the milk. If you (were) last in the line or too
late, you (were) going home with no milk."
Mesko recalls his mother waiting in line for
three hours to purchase eggs for a birthday
cake for her son. On the way home, she tripped
on a curb and dropped the eggs she had worked
so hard to obtain. "She cried for another three
hours," Mesko said.
"It was always a fight," Michael said. "To
have some things, you need to sacrifice. We just
(ate) to survive one day to another day."
When mesko was 11, his parents entered
the green card lottery and were some of the
55,000 chosen to receive a green card out of the -
200,000 that applied.
Luckily for the Meskos, they had friends who
had won the lottery the year before to help the
family settle down in Twinsburg, Ohio.
Having learned English in school in Roma-
nia, 11-year-old Mesko found the transition
much easier than his parents.
In Romania, Michael had been a mechanical
engineer and Elizabeth a civil engineer. When
his family first came to the United States,
Mesko's mother cleaned houses and his father
assembled door locks to earn minimum wage.
Since then, things have gotten much better
- Michael is currently a quality control engi-
neer and Elizabeth is a geotechnical engineer
with a client list that has included NASA and
the Cleveland Browns. Though they've been
busy, Mesko's parents haven't missed a single
Michigan football home game in the last four
years.
And their son has not disappointed in his
five years at Michigan, working hard both on
the field and in the classroom. He graduated
from the Ross School of Business lastcyear with
a 3.65 GPA, breaking nearly every Michigan
punting record along the way.
"You talk about the American dream - he is
(it)," former Michigan head coach Lloyd Carr
said of Mesko, whom he recruited out of high
school. "He's not just a football player. He's a

guy that's making the very most of all of his
opportunities here."
But no matter how busy things got, Mesko
always worked to keep a smile on his face and
on the faces of those around him.
"He always had this sense of humor,"
Michael said. "The whole population in Roma-
nia has this spirit, this humor spirit. We are
joking, we are laughing. Because this is how
you need to take life, seriously, but you need to
smile."
IN TWO WEEKS, Mesko will probably
have one more reason to smile. On April 22,
the 2010 NFL Draft will commence and Mesko
is widely believed to be one of the top punters
available.
It's a rare feat for a punter to be selected,
and many project Mesko will be one of the only
punters in this year's draft.
Despite the excitement surrounding the
upcoming weeks, Mesko admits he didn't
always want to be a football player. Growing
up in Romania, he mostly played soccer with
his friends, and Michael remembers a stadium
across the street from their apartment where
Mesko and his friends would sneak in to play.
They would climb the 10-foot high cement
fence to enter, careful not to cut their hands
on the shards of glass at the top. Sometimes
guards with dogs would chase them out, but
they always went back.
The change to football came one fateful day
during gym class in Ohio. Mesko was in the
eighth grade and the class was playing kickball.
When it was his turn, he kicked the ball so hard
it knocked out a light on the gym ceiling.
Mesko's gym teacher, Mr. Springer, who was
also the high school football coach, decided to
give the big leg an ultimatum - pay for the light
or play football next year.
The scrawny eighth grader grew up during
high school - growing three inches and gain-
ing 80 pounds - and by the time Mesko got to
Michigan, many believed he had the potential
to do incredible things both as a Wolverine and
beyond.
"When we practiced the punt, everybody
watched because they knew that he was going
to unleash some unbelievable punts that
(looked like they) were shot from a rocket,"
Carr said. "The first time he did it in a game,
you could hear an 'ohhh' in the stands."
It wasn't just his punts that got the fans'
attention, though. In 2006, Mesko's redshirt
freshman year, the students started a tradition
that lasted his entire career at the University.
Whenever Mesko would punt, the student sec-
tion would form a "Z" with their hands.
For Mesko, it was an honor unseen.
"I kept hearing about it," Mesko said. "And
I was, like, 'What's the big deal?' So I went to
check it out and it was right before a snap. I
looked up and the snap was about to hit me in
my facemask. And I was like, 'Oh crap, get rid of
it, go go go.' I never really got to see it a lot but I
knew it was out there."
IT WASN'T UNTIL his redshirt sopho-
more season that Mesko truly began to hone
his skills when Filip Filipovic, a former NFL
punter with the Dallas Cowboys, offered to
help Mesko with his technique.
At the time, Mesko was strugglingto improve
and looking for guidance.
Over the years, the relationship has grown.

This year, when Mesko's last season at Michi-
gan ended, Filipovic traveled from Chicago
every week leading up to the NFL Scouting
Combine to help Mesko prepare.
The mentorship has proved beneficial as
Todd McShay, director of college football scout-
ing for ESPN Scouts Inc., said Mesko is prob-
ably one of the top punters in this year's draft
class with potential to develop into a starting
punter at the next level. Filipovic agrees.
"Zoltan (is) the kind of guy that can punt in
cold weather, he can punt directionally inside
the 20 (yard line), ore-step punts out of the
back of theend zone, he can do that," Filipovic
said.
"He really has become one of those punt-
ers who has all of the attributes. He has good
hands. He's quick with his get off time. There's
really no reason for a coachto getnervous about
sending him out onto the field at any level."
MESKO IS A self-proclaimed goofball.
His best friend on the football team, fifth-
year senior Tim North, said Mesko is always
trying to get his teammates to laugh, especially
during morning workouts.
He may have met his match though when the
Pittsburgh Steelers and Atlanta Falcons start-
ed asking a tough question at last month's NFL
Scouting Combine.
"They sat me down and said, 'Just tell us a
joke,'" Mesko said. "'Uhhh, I wasn't prepared
for this.' And I told this joke that was so bad. I
stopped them and I was, like, 'I have to apolo-
gize for that bad joke.' And they were just look-
ing at each other and they were, like 'OK, let's
move on.' "
But despite missing his chance to show
potential future employers his humor, Mesko
has had his fair share of shenanigans with
teammates and a famous former Wolverine,
too.
After former Michigan defensive end
LaMarr Woodley's first season with the Pitts-
burgh Steelers, he came back to Ann Arbor
to workout in the Michigan weight room and
train with the strength and conditioning
coaches. One day, Mesko was fooling around in
the training room with a crutch he managed to
get his hands on and he hit Woodley in the shin.
The 6-foot-2 inch 250 pound-plus Woodley
wasn't happy, but Mesko was able to get away.
For the next few months, whenever Woodley
would see Mesko he would vow to get him back.
Then, one day Woodley was driving his new
Mercedes Benz in the athletic campus parking
lot and saw Mesko on his cell phone. Woodley
got out of his car and started chasing Mesko,
who didn't see it coming. But Woodley had for-
got to put his car in park and it almost smashed
into Yost Ice Arena. He had to sprint back to his
car to get it to stop just in time.
"There's one thing about Zoltan, he doesn't
care who you are, he's going to try and make
you laugh," North said. "He's not intimidated
by someone. That's just the way he is."
THOUGH MESKO PLANS to play foot-
ball at the professional level, he has always
entertained the idea of entering the business
world as well. He graduated with "high dis-
tinction" from the Ross School of Business last
year, and this May he will complete his Masters
in Sport Management.
From an early age, Mesko's mother worked

by a faculty group that this person was not subver-
sive," Haber said.
Getting rid of the approval committee would
eventually become one of Haber's priorities. But in
the fall of 1954, Haber was just a University fresh-
man who skipped class to attend his first demon-
stration - more out of curiosity than conviction.
"I probably didn't know it was a demonstration,
because why would I have known that this was
called that?" Haber recalled. "So in a way, it was
different times."
A group of mostly graduate students was protest-
ing the University's decision to fire three faculty
members who had refused to sign loyalty oaths.
Haber became involved with this group, which
included members with socialist and communist
tendencies. Eventually, Haber and his friends found
a faculty advisor and started a political issues club
on campus. Though the club remained discussion-
based for the first few years, the University was
once again, slowly but surely, becoming a place
where students could challenge accepted ideas.
"I witnessed the coming-into-consciousness of
activism; from very quiet to quite active," Haber
said.
What was happening at the University of Michi-
gan was also slowly taking shape on campuses
nationwide. Bob Zellner, the first white southern
field secretary for the Student Nonviolent Coordi-
nating Committee, a student group that fought for
racial equality, remembers the emerging energy of
the time.
"We were just coming out of what they call the
silent '50s, and everybody was getting involved,"
Zellner said. "It was a mass movement. It was very
exciting."
For the next few years, that excitement
only grew. As students across the country
became involved in the struggle for civil
rights, women's rights and world peace, the Univer-
sity of Michigan led the way. On March 24,1965, the
University held the first-ever teach-in, where over
3,000 people participated in lectures, discussions
and debates about the Vietnam War.
Haber remembers that day fondly, aswell as what
followed. "A hundred and some campuses across
the country did it," he said, "and a whole network
of academics, intellectuals and people who were
knowledgeable about Vietnam and about history

became a community, a knowledgeable public."
The creation of a knowledgeable public was
what was necessary, in Haber's view, to effect real
change. Once the public became informed, the gov-
ernment would alter its policies to reflect the view
of the people. Or so the activists thought.
"That didn't happen at all," Haber said. He
recalled a debate with federal authorities on the
Vietnam War, which was organized by Haber and
the Inter-University Committee for Debate on For-
eign Policy. "We wiped the floor with them. But it
had no impact."
This inability of activism to generate actual
change in the realm of public policy frustrated
many in the movement, who increasingly turned
to more dramatic - and in some cases, dangerous
- methods of getting their point across. Radicals
argued with each other over whether to remain
nonviolent or whether to bring home the reality of
war to the American people by committing domes-
tic violence. The assassinations of President John
Kennedy, Martin Luther King and Robert Ken-
nedy - and the air of conspiracy that circled these
murders - only made activists more concerned that
peaceful tactics weren't working.
"When you get lied to on the one hand and when
knowledge doesn't make any difference on the
other hand, and people had walked around in cir-
cles and froze for peace every winter, what is the
point of getting out there and freezing your butt off
with a sign?" Haber said.
These dilemmas were soon compounded by
infighting between various groups within the
movement. The black members of SNCC clashed
with the white members. Female members of SDS
accused the group of being patriarchal. By the
1970s, SDS, SNCC and plenty of other groups had
ceased to exist. The movement lost many of the
threads holding it together.
And that, if one believes the hype, was the end of
student activism.
ut contrary to popular belief, student activ-
ism didn't die - it merely took different
forms that some would argue have been
more effective, though less visible, than the tactics
of the '60s.
"I think there's a little bit of a fetishization or
romanticization of the '60s," said Vasugi Gane-
shananthan, Zell Visiting Professor of Creative

Writing at the University, who has written exten-
sively on '60s activism. "This idea that caring for
the sake of caring, thatsomehow passion is in and
of itself an end - I don't know that I agree with
that."
While no one can deny the passion of the '60s
activists, many felt - and still feel - that their
achievements were fewer than they expected..
Ganeshananthan believes that you can look at
it both ways. For one, some of their more radi-
cal tactics scared away people who were in the
mainstream. These acts also drove compromise
positions further to the left.
"And then there's the other argument that in
order to enable real change you need people to be
on the far, far left, because then the compromise
is to end up somewhere in the middle and then at
least you sort of shift the dial a little bit," Gane-
shananthan said. "I just tend to not find those
arguments that compelling."
That's not to say that 60s activism didn't
accomplish anything. Haber's activities were
partly responsible for the University rolling back
many of its egregiously sexist and racist policies,
such as requiring curfews for female students
and forbidding interracial dating.
"They also responded by making the curricu-
lum more flexible," Haber said. "The University
had accommodated in some way to courses that
touch on human rights."
In Haber's view, these changes have encour-
aged students to pursue careers that are activ-
ism-oriented, such as international law.
Student activism since the '60s has been about
making arguments that are not only compelling,
but also attract people to participate in the move-
ment. Such a shift has led to an increase, not a
decrease, in student activism.
"It may be that there's more student action
now than there was in the '60s, it's just so
diverse and in so many different mediums,"
Zellner said. "Now there's trouble everywhere
and there's action everywhere, so there's prob-
ably as much activity now as there was then, or
even more."
Today, students are evolving activism online,
in conferences and through internships and
careers in humanitarian and social justice fields.
And they are constantly assessing their methods
in light of the past.

This spring marks the fiftieth anniversary
of the founding of both SDS and SNCC. To
celebrate this anniversary and discuss how
activism has changed, many '60s activists, includ-
ing Haber and Zellner, reunited last month for a
conference entitled "Bring It Back, Take It For-
ward." Of course, there was no better place to hold
it than Ann Arbor.
While the conference, organized by the School
of Social Work, purported to remember the past as
well as look to the future, many of the attendees said
that they preferred the future. One person who felt
this way was Bill Ayers, the co-founder of Weather
Underground who was recently thrust back into
the national spotlight in 2008 when it was alleged
that Barack Obama was closely linked to him. Ayers
participated in a panel discussion during the con-
ference and shared his thoughts.
"I don't have any nostalgia for the '60s at all,"
Ayers told the conference attendees. "I don't have a
nostalgic bone in my body."
Ayers worried that student activists today think
that their actions have less merit because they
aren't repeating the same activities of the '60s.
"I think the myth and symbol of the '60s in some
ways sits heavily on young people today who think
that, somehow, the trick is to reproduce the time
when we had the best demonstrations, the best
music and the best sex," Ayers said. "Actually the
sex is still great, the music is good (and) we don't
need to replicate the demonstrations of the past."
In an interview after the panel, Ayers explained
that he doesn't buy the notion that students are
somehow less active or passionate today than they
were back then. "I think that people who see it that
way are looking for a replay of something that was
in the past," he said. "It's ridiculous."
In fact, many of the conference attendees felt
that the heightened student activity of today was
all the more remarkable because it's more difficult
to be an activist now than it was in the '60s. This is
not to say that activism was easy in the '60s. Zell-
ner told attendees that five of his colleagues were
murdered by southern racists during his first three
years working for SNCC. But though the physical

risks of being a radical have greatly decreased, the
economic costs are higher than ever. -
"There was a lot of risk, a lot of real, physical
risk in the '60s, but it is much more difficult now,
economically, to be an activist," said Andrew Lich-
terman, a nuclear disarmament activist, during a
question-and-answer session after the panel. "It's a
lot harder to start your own small institution on a
shoe string."
Since the 1960s, the cost of a college education
has skyrocketed and the pace of college has acceler-
ated. The result is that students don't have nearly as
much free time to dedicate to activity. And Haber
thinks it's noaccident that the tempo of college life
has sped up over the last 50 years.
"They had some system planners (that thought),
'How do we close down activism here at this insti-
tution?'" Haber said. "Well, you speed up the work-
er and you don't give them any toilet breaks," Haber
said. "You run it like a factory."
Haber recalled that there used to be longer
breaks at Thanksgiving, the winter holidays and
during the school year, which lasted into June. This
made it easier to dedicate time to activism and still
catch up on schoolwork before exams. But this free
time has largely disappeared.
"Now, you miss a day, you miss a week, you can't
do it," Haber said. "You're wasted around this
noose of student debt or parental financial engage-
ment or expectation, and you can't just be an
activist. I used to say activism is a five-year under-
graduate degree, whatever your second major
might be. You drop out, you take more time - but
you can't do that now."
With greater and greater fiscal constraints
placed on students - especially those from the
state of Michigan, where the economic downturn
has been especially brutal - it's more difficult for
them to justify neglecting their school work in
order to focus on something else. The University,
parents and financial realities are all demanding
that students go to class, even if the inequality in
the world is calling them to be activists. In light of
such hardships, the fact that activism is thriving in
