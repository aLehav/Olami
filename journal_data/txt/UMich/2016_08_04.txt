City Council primary 
 

reaffirms status quo 

Yousef Rabhi 
wins race for 
State House of 
Representatives

All contested 

incumbents win 

re-election Tuesday

By BRIAN KUANG, KEVIN 

LINDER, ISHI MORI

Daily Summer News Editor, Daily 

Staff Reporters

Of 
the 
five 
City 
Council 

members up for re-election this 
year, only three were challenged 
in the Democratic primary. In the 
Tuesday primary election, all three 
prevailed, and, because Ann Arbor 
traditionally votes overwhelmingly 
Democratic, Councilmembers Sumi 
Kailasapathy (D–Ward 1), Graydon 
Krapohl (D–Ward 4) and Chuck 
Warpehoski (D–Ward 5) will most 
likely be re-elected in November.

In 
an 
interview 
following 

the final tally, Warpehoski said 
Tuesday’s results are an affirmation 
of the present state of affairs in local 
government.

“When three of the six seats are 

uncontested, and those three seats 
are won by the incumbent, I think 
that shows there’s a high level of 
satisfaction with the direction the 

city’s headed in,” Warpehoski said, 
also noting Mayor Christopher 
Taylor was also unchallenged for 
re-election. “I think the voters have 
said that they want a continuation 
of the policies that they’ve been 
seeing.”

In addition to all incumbents 

being 
re-elected, 
Warpehoski 

noted that voting along the lines 
of specific issues also fell along 
the status quo of Ann Arbor. For 
example, Warpehoski pointed out 
that Kailasapathy has been more 
skeptical of new development in 
the city than her colleagues on 
the council, as well as her two 
challengers. 
Though 
she 
was 

ultimately re-elected, her more 
development-friendly 
challengers 

Jason Frenzel and Will Leaf 
collectively secured 55 percent of 
the vote.

“It shows that there’s a sense 

that having a diversified economy 
is something that’s valued in this 
city,” Warpehoski said, referring 
to the election results. “And people 
recognize that means we need to 
add housing capacity and office 
capacity to support the diversified 
economy.”

This was also the pattern in 

the Ward 4 and Ward 5 races, 
Warpehoski 
noted. 
Incumbent 

Krapohl and his challenger Diane 
Giannola were more friendly to 
further expansions in downtown 
than the third candidate, Eric 
Lipson, 
and, 
collectively, 
they 

received 63 percent of the vote.

In Warpehoski’s own re-election 

race, his challenger — Kevin Leeser 
— had been vocally opposed to the 
construction of high-rise student 
housing and was defeated by 1,304 
votes.

Leeser told the Daily after the 

results were released he intends to 
continue to advocate for improved 
pedestrian safety — his signature 
campaign issue — as a private citizen 
and reiterated that he is unhappy 
with the city’s current level of safety.

Of the three incumbents, only 

Kailasapathy — who has frequently 
been a dissenting voice against the 
majority on the council — was not 
endorsed by Mayor Taylor, who 
opted to endorse her opponent, 
Jason Frenzel. The Ward 4 race was 
particularly close, with Kailasapthy 
and Frenzel neck-and-neck for votes 
until the final precinct reported.

Candidate vows to 
fight for Democratic 
majority in legislature

Daily Summer News Editor

Yousef Rabhi has been announced 

as the winner of the Democratic 
primary for the Michigan House of 
Representatives’ 53rd District seat 
with 16 precints reporting, edging 
out his opponent Steven Kwasny.

With 
all 
but 
four 
precints 

reporting, Rabhi recieved 7,237 votes 
to his opponents’ 1,225 with a voter 
turnout of at least 14 percent.

Washtenaw 
County 

Commissioner Yousef Rabhi declared 
his candidacy when incumbent State 
Representative Jeff Irwin (D–Ann 
Arbor) was barred from running for 
re-election due to term limits.

Rabhi had widely been considered 

the favorite to succeed Irwin, 
receiving 
Irwin’s 
endorsement. 

Rabhi also earned endorsements 
from the majority of local elected 
officials 
in 
Washtenaw 
County 

— including Mayor Christopher 
Taylor and the entire Ann Arbor 
City Council — as well as statewide 
advocacy 
groups 
including 
the 

American Federation of Teachers 
Michigan and the local chapter of 
United Automobile Workers, which 
represents Ann Arbor.

Rabhi was challenged in the 

Democratic 
Primary 
by 
Steven 

Kwasny, 
a 
28-year-old 
Eastern 

Michigan University student, whose 
central issue was campaign finance 
reform. Kwasny explicitly refused to 
accept financial contributions to his 
campaign and relied solely on web 
advertising and volunteers.

Low-income groups 
at elevated risk for 
premature death

Better management 
of chronic diseases 

may not explain 
racial discrepancy 

By ALEXA ST.JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

About 80 percent of older 

adults have one chronic disease, 
according 
to 
the 
National 

Council on Aging. Additionally, 
95 percent of health care costs 
for those older adults in the 
United States can be attributed 
to chronic diseases.

In his recent study at the 

University of Michigan, Shervin 
Assari, a psychiatric research 
investigator, found that, among 
individuals 
with 
a 
chronic 

disease, African Americans die 
earlier on average than white 
people. For him, the question 
remained: what role does chronic 
health conditions play in these 
earlier death rates?

While it was clear to Assari 

racial and socioeconomic factors 
influence premature death in the 
United States, he wanted to look 
into whether these factors have 
an effect on mortality altogether, 
or if one factor explains the 
effect of the other.

The study, published in the 

Journal of Racial and Ethnic 
Health Disparities, used data 
from the Americans’ Changing 
Lives Study — a nationally 
representative 
longitudinal 

study following 3,361 white and 
Black adults 25 years of age and 
older in the United States. With 
this dataset, Assari assessed 
multiple 
measures, 
including 

demographics, 
socioeconomic 

status, race, number of chronic 
medical conditions and mortality 
to establish why Black people die 
earlier than white people.

Behaviors that contribute to 

contracting these chronic health 
diseases include a lack of physical 
activity, 
smoking 
cigarettes, 

excessive drinking and poor 

dietary habits, according to the 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention.

Assari discovered that, while 

the number of chronic medical 
conditions mediate the effect of 
race on mortality, the same may 
not be for the effects of social 
class.

“The mechanism by which 

race influences mortality may 
have some differences from the 
mechanism that education does 
the same thing,” Assari said.

Assari found that, if chronic 

medical conditions — such as 
obesity, diabetes, heart disease 
and cancer — are the reason that 
Black people die earlier than 
white people, the best solution 
would be to improve medical 
care so as to reduce Black deaths 
by chronic disease.

“If you can help Blacks avoid 

chronic conditions, you have 
succeeded in undoing the effects 
of race on mortality,” Assari said. 
“The only thing you need to do 
to undo the effects of race on 
mortality is to help them prevent 
chronic 
disease 
or 
improve 

care of chronic disease and 
management of chronic disease 
so that that doesn’t kill them 
more than whites.”

This is not, however, the case 

for social class.

According to Assari, poor 

socioeconomic 
status 
has 

been linked to many chronic 
conditions, along with racial 
status. 
Yet 
chronic 
diseases 

alone do not explain how social 
class determines these earlier 
instances of death. The number 
of chronic medical conditions 
only 
partially 
mediates 
the 

effects of social class, implying 
other factors must be involved.

Assari said beside a number 

of chronic medical conditions, 
education 
or 
socioeconomic 

status, the type of chronic 
medical condition or mental 
health status could play a role in 
the risk of premature death.

“(Prevention or management 

of chronic disease) is not the only

Ross faculty outlines efforts in research, 
teaching, outreach and entrepreneurship

School highlights 
sustainability and 

collaboration

By ALEXA ST.JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

Through 
leadership 
and 

entrepreneurship 
practices, 

concern for global sustainability 
and areas of study spanning from 
business economics to finance to 
management, the University of 
Michigan Ross School of Business 
has consistently ranked among the 
nation’s best — ranking fourth in 
undergraduate schools nationwide 
by the U.S. News and World 
Report. Yet there is an additional 
aspect of the business school that 
has greatly expanded since the 
school’s establishment in 1924: 
research.

Whether one is studying an 

arguably more traditional aspect 
of business, such as accounting 
and marketing, or focusing on 
innovative 
business 
models, 

researchers at Ross are exploring 
a variety of topics to sustain a 
successful 
business 
program 

and improve economic relations 
throughout the world.

Accounting – Role of Business

The Paton Center for Research 

in Accounting was established to 
honor William Paton, a University 
alum 
and 
former 
University 

accounting professor. Some of 
Paton’s accomplishments include 
developing innovative accounting 
techniques and founding of the 
Accounting Review — the oldest 
scholarly journal in accounting — 
in 1926. 

Paton’s 
students 
— 
many 

now in their 80s — created 
the center to recognize Paton 
as a respected member of the 
academic community and world-
known thought leader, Catherine 
Shakespeare, 
faculty 
director 

of the Master of Accounting 
Program, said.

“He created a sense of excellence 

around accounting — made it a 
rigorous 
scientific 
discipline,” 

Shakespeare said. “The center 
was founded in his honor and the 
purpose of the center is excellence 
in all things accounting.”

Shakespeare 
said 
having 
a 

center specifically focusing on 
accounting didactics and research 
has been beneficial to advancing 
Paton’s mission, especially for 
doctoral students.

“We 
are 
the 
number 
one 

accounting Ph.D. program in the 
country with a long history of 
incredibly successful alums, and I 
think that’s in part to do with the 
support of the Paton Accounting 
Center,” Shakespeare said.

In addition to encouraging 

students to enter the accounting 
field, the center helps to change 
common misconceptions about 
what the field actually entails, 
Shakespeare 
said. 
One 
such 

misconception is that accountants 
work in isolation with a calculator, 
but Shakespeare said accounting 
— especially modern accounting 
— is much more interactive and 
collaborative than people think, 
as accountants work with many 
people in companies and firms to 
review their information and make 
decisions. 

“Accounting is about ‘how do 

you take information and make 

decisions?,’ 
whether 
internally 

in the firm or externally as a 
stakeholder,” Shakespeare said. 
“You have to be able to understand 
that 
everything 
is 
based 
in 

numbers and relationships. That’s 
really what accounting is about: is 
being able to understand the story 
the firm is able to tell you about its 
financial performance.”

Shakespeare said while there 

are two main types of accounting 
— financial and management — 
she focuses her research on the 
former, which involves businesses 
and 
publicly-listed 
companies 

that externally report required 
information to their shareholders. 
Shakespeare’s work is often policy-
oriented since she works with 
global standard setters in relating 
the importance of regulation in 
financial institutions. Standard 
setters 
set 
strict 
guidelines 

that establish how companies 
should reveal their information 
to shareholders and investors, 
controlling what consumers and 
shareholders see regarding the

Rushing to the end

I 

was closely following the 
convention this week, as 
a 
good 
politically-minded 

student 
does. 

Blown 
away 

by the high-
minded 
oratory 
and 

passion from the likes of the 
Obamas, Khizr Khan and Joe 
Biden, I began to get nervous for 
Clinton’s big moment. Her address 
to the world as the first female 
nominee was billed as “the biggest 
moment of her career,” which 
is a lot of pressure for anyone, 
let alone a noted introvert. In a 
sea of idealistic (and potentially 
unrealistic), Clinton represented 
incremental 
pragmatism. 
Not 

necessarily 
the 
aspirational, 

inspirational candidate we saw 
eight years ago. It seemed like so 
much was riding on this speech, so 
much which, in the past, Clinton 
was unable to deliver. And all 
I could hear was “Fight Song” 
looping incessantly and cloyingly 
both on television and inside my 
head. Both my nerves and my 
irritation grew. 

As 
she 
entered 
the 
stage, 

beaming ear to ear and in a 
gleaming white — you guessed 
it — pantsuit, Clinton appeared 
confident, cool and ready. Her 
speech 
was 
relatively 
solid, 

not crazily awe-inspiring or 
laced with satire, but what did 
you expect from her? From the 
“texts from Hillary” meme to 
the role she took on as First 
Lady, Clinton has always had 
the no-nonsense reputation of 
getting into the behind-the-
scenes work. She’s known for 
meeting with Republicans while 
in 
office, 
passing 
practical 

bipartisan 
legislation 
in 
the 

Bush-era legislature and trying 
— 
sometimes 
unsuccessfully, 

and sometimes incorrectly — but 

trying nonetheless, to slowly but 
surely change policy.

And then the camera panned 

over to the audience. In the 
corner of my eye, I glimpsed her. 
A girl, not older than thirteen, 
stood on the sidelines, gripping 
a “Stronger Together” sign, a big 
braces-filled smile on her face 
and her wide eyes behind frames, 
hopeful and glassy. That was when 
I felt it, the weight of this historic 
moment. Until then, I had been 
pragmatic about my support for 
Clinton. She was experienced 
and was winning, therefore I 
was going to get behind her. But 
when I saw this girl, coupled with 
Clinton’s line, “when there are 
no glass ceilings, the sky’s the 
limit,” I became filled with a love 
and an obligation to my younger 
self and to girls everywhere. I 
became enthralled by the history 
of the moment, and I became 
enthusiastic 
about 
Hillary 

Clinton. 

This was the moment I realized 

that this night, this convention, 
this election, was for the girls. The 
girls who are told from age 2, when 
their little brothers and sisters are 
born, that they will be just such a 
good mommy one day. The girls 
whose moms never faltered in 
showing what true strength and 
sacrifice looked like. The girls 
whose dads realized why gender 
equality was so important when 
they first heard their daughter’s 
mind at work. 

This is for the girls who practice 

their class presentations over and 
over again because their voices are 
too quiet or too loud or too angry. 
The girls who are told to smile 
more. The girls who are told to let 
boys be boys. The girls who take 
the group project into their own 
hands, but share the A+ grade with 
everyone on their team. The girls 
who know that despite doing this 

work, they’re still paid less in the 
end. The girls who try so hard that 
they sometimes lose their way, but 
they keep going and keep searching 
and keep striving. The girls who 
sometimes have doubts in their 
abilities, especially when they are 
the only girl in the room, but keep 
working and learning and growing 
anyway. The girls who are told to 
ask fewer questions. The girls who 
are told that reading that much 
gives your eyes wrinkles. The girls 
who get angry when someone tells 
them to just take the joke. The girls 
who are scared that hard work 
won’t be enough to get recognized. 

This is for the girls who are told 

that they can’t wear pink or they’re 
not going to be taken seriously. 
The girls who are told that they 
can’t play sports or be an engineer 
because they’re not going to find a 
man who will like them. The girls 
who train harder at practice, put in 
more hours at their part-time job, 
take time to comfort their friends 
and never, ever stop caring about 
what they can do for others. 

This is for the girls who have 

never had a woman to lead them, 
a woman to look up to, a woman to 
let them know that this it is truly 
possible to put yourself out there 
and actually win. This is for the 
girls who have never had a woman 
to lead them, a woman to disagree 
with, but a woman to represent the 
powerful apex of the nation. This is 
for the girls who want to see more 
women who look and feel a little 
bit more like them rise to affect 
change at the highest level, today 
and tomorrow. 

This is for the girls who are now 

women, but deep down are still 
those audacious, caring, brave, 
hardworking, bossy, intelligent, 
thoughtful girls.

I 

can’t handle how quickly this 
summer is coming to an end. 
It seems like I just got out of 

classes, 
that 

only 
a 
few 

days ago I was 
moving out of 
my dorm room 
and into my summer housing. It 
seems like yesterday I was excitedly 
meeting up with my friends who 
were also staying in Ann Arbor 
for the summer, and making over-
the-top plans for how we would 
spend our free time together, like 
kayaking or going on a road trip 
(most of our time together was 
actually spent watching movies and 
TV shows). I feel like I still have a 
lot more relaxing to do, a lot more 
napping that needs to be done, a lot 
more TV that needs watching. I feel 
like I need more time to prepare 
myself for what is coming next, 
because what is really scary to me 
about the fact that the summer 
is almost over is that my college 
experience is also almost over. 

OK, I’m only a rising junior, so 

it’s not like the end of college is 
really imminent, but I feel like I 
haven’t earned the title of “junior” 
yet. I still feel like that freshman 
who nervously sweated whenever 
a professor called on her and who 
spent hours during Welcome Week 
trying to find where all the classes 
on her schedule were so that she 
didn’t show up late to class on 
the first day. And though I’ve 
accepted the fact that I’m now late 
to everything and that the pain of 
embarrassing oneself in front of an 
entire college class is something 
I will just have to live through, I 
don’t feel like an upperclassmen. 
I’m not mature, I don’t have my 
life together (whatever that even 
means), I don’t have the wardrobe 
I deserve — all things I thought 
I would have by the time I was 
considered “almost done” with my 
college career.

In all seriousness, though, I 

honestly feel like my life is moving 
way too fast. Even the people who, 
to me, have their lives together 
confess their fear at thinking about 
what is to come, their disbelief at 
how quickly their time at college 
has gone by. We all knew that 
college would be a defining time in 
our lives, but we didn’t know that 
it would be over so soon. Maybe 
my fear isn’t focused on how not-
ready I am for the future, but how 
I still feel like I need a lot more 
time to goof off and be a kid — or 
at least a stupid college student. 

To be honest, how ill-prepared and 
confused I’m feeling is making me 
incredibly nervous for the future 
and forcing me to realize that what 
I was taught by “13 Going on 30” 
that nobody ever actually feels like 
an adult is completely true.

How are we expected to live our 

lives when it seems like everything 
is moving at 100 miles per hour? I 
have this image of myself going 
down a waterslide, and in this 
image, instead of allowing gravity 
to do what it does best, I’m pushing 
against the plastic walls for dear life. 
Perpetually stuck in the same space 
by choice, water rushes around me 
until I eventually get tired and give 
up, tumbling awkwardly down the 
waterslide (sorry about the terrible 
metaphor). 
This 
is 
sometimes 

what I feel like doing — forcing 
everything and everyone to stop 
changing. Of course, I’m not sure 
how I would accomplish this feat, 
but also something tells me I should 
stop wishing for it. Maybe it’s the 
final seasons of “That ‘70s Show” 
and “Scrubs” that subconsciously 
taught me that sometimes change 
and giving up is the better and less 
disappointing option.

So how do we deal with a world 

that moves so fast during the period 
in our lives where everything is 
changing? How do we find stability? 
To be honest, I have no idea. The 
world is now a place where people 
rarely have the same job their entire 
adulthood and everybody is always 
moving around — I’ve been told by 
my parents that my twenties will 
be the wildest ride of my life. I’m 
not sure where my life is going, 
what job I will end up with, where 
I will end up living — so many 
important aspects of my future 
are completely out of my control. 
Instead, I’m trying to focus on the 
things within my control: who I 
spend time with, what I spend time 
on, what I decide to. I don’t want to 
look back at my twenties and realize 
that I took every opportunity that 
came my way and met a bunch 
of new people, but that I never 
developed any good friendships, 
never stuck with one cause, never 
laid 
any 
foundations. 
Values 

differ from person to person, 
but relationships are what I have 
decided to focus on. Though I 
didn’t decide where the highway 
was being built, at least I can 
decide to stay behind the wheel of 
the car.

by a question or find yourself at 
a loss for an answer more than 
once, and that is nothing to be 
concerned with.

When I started out writing this 

piece, there were at least a dozen 
times I almost deleted everything 
I’d written or tried to downplay 
what I’d learned to make it seem 
as though there wasn’t such 
a big hole in my knowledge. I 
certainly considered writing on 
a different topic to avoid what 
embarrassment I might feel once 
it was published or to dodge any 
judgment I felt might come my 
way.

But as I continued to write this 

piece, I realized it was important 
for me to get it out there, as I 
thought it could speak to not 
just my own worries, but those 
of others. We shouldn’t have 
to live in a world where we are 
embarrassed or afraid to admit 
we 
learned 
something 
new. 

Having knowledge is a wonderful 
thing, but so is learning new 
things. Even if it seems like you 
should have known it before, that 
may simply be the high standards 
you set for yourself. 

Just 
because 
there 
is 

knowledge out there that you 

haven’t learned, you are no 
less sensitive to other peoples 
or 
other 
cultures. 
You 
are 

not ignorant. It doesn’t mean 
you don’t spend enough time 
wanting to understand and be 
compassionate toward others. It 
isn’t about what you know from 
the get-go that defines who you 
are, but it’s what you do with 
what you learn that shapes the 
person you are. 

You aren’t Google or Siri. 

You’re human.

You’ll never know everything
W

hen 
I 
first 
began 

working at the law 
firm I was interning 

for 
this 

summer, 
I’d 

never 
heard 

of 
Mam 
or 

Quiché 
— 

two different 
ethnic groups indigenous to 
Guatemala. In fact, this summer 
was the first time I had heard 
of 
Spanish-speaking 
Ladinos, 

persecuting indigenous peoples 
of Central American countries 
because 
of 
their 
indigenous 

traditions, 
culture 
and 
the 

fact that Spanish was not their 
first language. In fact, quite 
a few of our clients spoke 
little to no Spanish, only their 
indigenous language (Mam or 
Quiché). Before this summer, 
I did not understand that clear 
distinction, and I wasn’t fully 
aware of all the different ethnic 
groups in these regions, nor 
did I understand the different 
languages of the regions.

And 
immediately 
after 

realizing that I had been unaware 
of these important facts up until 
that point, I felt embarrassed, 
ashamed that I didn’t know all 
this before. Through listening 
to the stories of many of our 
clients and potential clients and 
learning about the prevalence 
of this persecution, I thought I 
should have known these facts 
already. 

In this moment, I felt as though 

this signified a great ignorance 
of important history, culture and 
people that I was ashamed to 
admit. My whole life I’d thought 
I was attuned to other peoples, 
other cultures, different places. I 
felt the security of what I thought 
I knew shatter — but fortunately, 
it was only for a brief moment.

After talking with family and 

family friends, sharing what I 
had learned in my first few days 
at work, I realized, to a varying 
degree, that many others were 
not completely aware of what 
I’d just learned either. Other 
people that I admired for their 
knowledge and understanding 
of various important issues also 
knew very little about this. It 
wasn’t just me, and it wasn’t 
abnormal.

While I would have loved to 

be able to come to a conclusion 
without others, since I still 
struggle 
to 
accept 
parts 
of 

myself, and self-consciousness 

still follows me around, seeing 
others react as I had helped.

And 
even 
when 
a 
friend 

or family member did know 
these facts that I was only just 
learning, they never made it a big 
deal that I didn’t. Instead, they 
simply shared in my anger in 
the persecution of these people, 
not even making a point to 
acknowledge that I didn’t know 
all the facts sooner.

Upon reflection, I was quick 

to beat myself up for not having 
all the knowledge on the subject, 
for being “out of touch.” But 
the reality is, how can we 
possess 
extensive 
knowledge 

about everything? That isn’t 
something 
we 
can 
neither 

expect of ourselves nor should 
we expect that of others. In 
fact, professionals specialize for 
different reasons, and they put 
aside any pride they may feel that 
they are an expert, when they are 
not well versed in another area 
of their profession. The same 
thing, I believe, can be applied to 
everyday knowledge.

As someone who works hard 

to understand and appreciate 
different peoples and different 
cultures, it worried me that I 
didn’t have all my facts. And 
while at first I felt that it was 
my fault, it doesn’t do any good 
to fixate on what we didn’t 
know and should have. Instead, 
appreciate 
it 
as 
a 
learning 

experience and realize that it 
is impossible for us to know 
everything.

Whether 
we 
want 
to 

acknowledge it or not, no one 
has all the answers. No one 
is above learning something 
new. And while this may seem 
obvious, it is something I don’t 
believe we focus on enough. We 
are so preoccupied with being 
right, thinking before you speak, 
that questions and unfinished 
thoughts can feel unwelcomed. 
We learn new things every day 
for the rest of our lives, and it is 
important to acknowledge that 
and to see it as a positive thing.

As opposed to raising an 

eyebrow 
when 
someone 

confesses they didn’t have all 
the facts or running for cover 
when you discover you didn’t 
have the answer, encouraging 
learning every day is important. 
And not only is it important, but 
it is unavoidable. I can assure 
you that in your lifetime, you 
will most certainly be tripped up

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK

‘Bourne’ subpar

By MATTHEW BARNAUSKAS

Daily TV/New Media Editor

It’s been four years since “The 

Bourne Legacy” and nine years 
since Matt Damon (“The Martian”) 
stepped 
into 

the role of the 
titular 
amne-

siac CIA assas-
sin. 
Director 

Paul Greengrass 
(“Captain Phil-
lips”) returns to 
helm the series, 
reuniting with 
his 
longtime 

editor Christo-
pher Rouse (who won an Oscar for 
“The Bourne Ultimatum”) to pen the 
screenplay. With all these pieces in 
place, it would seem that the Bourne 
series would be primed to return to 
the genre-defining, award-winning 
form it once held. However, “Jason 
Bourne” takes a few too many steps 
back and creates an entry that feels 
more like a retread than a return to 
relevance.

Greengrass still proves himself a 

competent hand in guiding the series’ 
action, being one of the few directors 
who knows how to effectively use 
a handheld camera, capturing the 
whirlwind pace of Bourne’s combat 
prowess, avoiding the downfalls of 
“shaky cam” and maintaining a con-
sistency and comprehensibility that’s 
often lost in lesser hands. However, 
despite all of Greengrass’s technical 
strengths, I found myself struggling 
to buy into the suspense and stakes 
the film presented on screen.

Unfortunately, this arises from 

the generally derivative nature of 
the script, which often cuts from 
the Bourne cloth but does little to 
reinvigorate the formula. For some, 
this return to the status quo will be 
more than enough, but for a series 
that once found itself at the forefront 
of the form, it’s hard not feel disap-
pointed by how formulaic and half-
baked “Jason Bourne” feels. Perhaps 
the series should have also found 
a way to bring writer Doug Liman 
(who also directed “The Bourne 
Legacy”) back as well.

Picking up years after Jason 

Bourne exposed Operation Black-
briar, the film finds Bourne just get-
ting by, taking part in the occasional 
bare-knuckle brawl to make a little 
cash. But when Nicky Parsons (Julia 
Stiles, “Silver Linings Playbook”) 
reenters his life with information 
regarding Bourne’s father and his 

subsequent recruitment into Tread-
stone, Bourne is thrust back into a 
world of conspiracies and a life on 
the run, pursued by CIA director 
Robert Dewey (Tommy Lee Jones, 
“No Country For Old Men”) and his 
protégé, Heather Lee (Alicia Vikan-
der, “The Danish Girl”).

While the cast is full of top-notch 

talent, its talents are mostly wasted 
on characters that either feel like 
repeats of previous Bourne arche-
types or underdeveloped plot points. 
Jones is the typical, old CIA vil-
lain previously played by the likes 
of Chris Cooper and Brian Cox. 
Meanwhile, we have the typical CIA 
assassin played by Vincent Cassel 
(“Black Swan”) that hunts Bourne 
with deadly efficiency. The pres-
ence of these figures isn’t detrimen-
tal; it’s their lack of differentiation 
that makes them struggle to become 
fully formed characters. They’re 
merely types and are never given 
the chance to define themselves in 
compelling ways. Cassell’s assassin 
has the inklings of a unique animos-
ity towards Bourne, but it’s even-
tually jettisoned for something far 
less intriguing. The only new char-
acter that “Jason Bourne” is able to 
provide some adequate layers to is 
Vikander’s Lee, whose loyalties are 
shifting between idealism and ambi-
tion.

Meanwhile, the film admirably 

tries and mostly fails to place itself 
in today’s world. With references to 
Edward Snowden, a Julian Assange-
esque figure and questions about pri-
vacy in a digital age, “Jason Bourne” 
attempts to be topical, but these 
ideas are never elevated beyond the 
passing mention or quick scene that 
provide little to no commentary on 
the issues the film wishes it could 
address.

These 
underdeveloped 
ideas 

extend to questions about Bourne’s 
psychology. There are some decent 
questions about Bourne’s purpose 
and whether he can be brought back 
into the CIA fold. But like most char-
acters and themes in “Jason Bourne,” 
the exploration of these questions 
yields few compelling answers.

While “Jason Bourne” brings back 

some of the series’ biggest heavy-
hitters it fails to utilize them in ways 
that breathe new life into the series, 
instead falling back on well worn 
tropes that are starting to lose trac-
tion. “Jason Bourne” may feel like 
a potential new beginning for the 
series, but it’s unable to distinguish 
itself from what came before.

A time to remember: 
seeing ‘Hamilton’ in NY

Experiencing the 
phenomenon in the 

room where it happens

By ALEX INTNER

Summer Managing Arts Editor

NEW YORK CITY — “How 

could ‘Hamilton’ possibly live up 
to the hype?”

That’s the question I was asking 

myself as I walked into the Richard 
Rodgers Theatre on Monday night. 
It’s a musical that has blown up like 
no other I’ve seen in the decade 
I’ve been following the genre. Its 
soundtrack is everywhere, resale 
tickets were selling for as much 
as 12 times their normal cost at 
their peak, the show won 11 Tony 
Awards, including Best Musical 
— and it even became the first 
musical ever to perform live from 
its stage at the Grammy Awards.

It was impossible to tune out the 

noise surrounding the show, and 
nearly impossible to tune out the 
actual music itself. I entered the 
theater having only heard a few 
songs from the musical, having 
waited nine months since the 
purchase of my tickets knowing 
very little of what I was about to 
see (besides having constantly 
heard that it’s one of the best 
musicals of our time).

The best thing I can say about 

the experience is that it lives up 
to the hype. As I’ve said before, 
Hamilton rests on a premise that 
shouldn’t remotely work. A hip-
hop musical about founding father 
Alexander Hamilton? It sounds 
ridiculous on paper. However, 
Lin Manuel Miranda injects life 
into these characters by giving 
them songs with energy, drive 
and emotion. The show moves at 
a breakneck pace, telling the story 
of the rise (and fall) of one of the 
nation’s founding fathers.

Even though I knew the story 

of the show (shocking spoiler: 
Aaron 
Burr 
kills 
Alexander 

Hamilton), that didn’t mean the 
show lacked stunning surprises. 
There’s 
nothing 
like 
hearing 

most of this score for the first 
time 
with 
the 
accompanying 

visuals, 
meticulously 
created 

and staged by director Thomas 

Kail and choreographer Andy 
Blankenbuehler. 
Not 
only 
is 

“Satisfied” one of the strongest 
songs in the show, but the rewind 
effect between Angelica’s toast at 
Alexander and her sister Eliza’s 
wedding and when it plays from 
Angelica’s perspective is one of 
the strongest visuals in the show. 
The musical also employs a double 
turntable as a major part of its set, 
using it to great effect as it spins 
the action around the center of the 
stage. As the show moves along and 
duels occur, being able to keep the 
action constantly moving added to 
the frantic energy of the show.

Yet, a Broadway musical is 

nothing without its cast, and for 
the most part the cast of mostly 
understudies, 
alternates 
and 

replacements was strong. Miguel 
Cervantes, who will be playing the 
role of Alexander Hamilton in the 
Chicago cast, was on for the lead 
role, taking a few practice runs on 
the Broadway stage before Chicago 
rehearsals start in earnest. He 
definitely has the singing voice 
and rapping skills to take on the 
role, as he held the show together 
with the skills of a much more 
seasoned actor in the lead role. 
Seth Stewart was on for Marquis 
Lafayette/Thomas Jefferson, and 
while it was weird to see the role 
be played by someone who’s bald, 
he had the wit and energy the 
role requires. Lexi Lawson, the 
permanent replacement for Eliza 
seems to need more time to grow 
into the role, but the seeds of how 
good she’ll eventually be were 
there, especially with the emotion 
she brought to the song “Burn.”

The only cast member who I 

found to be somewhat lacking was 
Austin Smith, one of two actors 
sharing the role of Aaron Burr 

until Brandon Victor Dixon moves 
in later this month. In the first act, 
he seemed to lack passion and fire. 
He showed the emotions in “Wait 
for It,” but it was clear he wasn’t 
actually feeling it. However in 
“The Room Where it Happens,” 
something must’ve woken up in 
him, because he made me feel 
Burr’s jealousy toward Hamilton 
in a way that he hadn’t earlier in 
the evening.

However, there were still a 

couple members of the original 
cast left. Christopher Jackson 
showed me why he was nominated 
for a Tony Award as George 
Washington. He plays with the 
role as only someone who has 
spent a year-and-a-half finding the 
nuances in a character can. In his 
shining moment, “One Last Time,” 
Washington points across the 
audience saying “History has its 
eyes on you.” Because of Jackson’s 
delivery and all of the noise this 
year’s election had brought, that 
moment lands with one of the 
strongest 
gut-punches 
of 
the 

evening.

Still, 
eventually 
the 

performances I saw will fade away. 
I’ll forget Cervante’s heartbreak as 
Alexander’s son gets killed in a duel, 
Smith’s anger in “The Room Where 
it Happens,” Stewart’s sardonic 
looks at the audience as Jefferson, 
Lawson’s inflection as she sang 
“Burn,” and Alysha Deslorieux’s 
powerful belt in “Satisfied.” They’ll 
disappear behind an original cast 
recording I’m likely going to listen 
to hundreds of times in the future. 
But, I’ll never forget how those 
performances made me feel. I’ll 
never forget the laughs and the 
tears and the fun and the beauty 
that occurred in the room where it 
happens. 

HAMILTON

I didn’t see most of these people, but it’s ok. I’m not bitter.

Latest Disgust-‘Nado’

TV REVIEW

Syfy’s latest provides 
an unintentional dose 
of despair and sadness

By MEGAN MITCHELL

Daily Arts Writer

After reaching only the first 

hour in my two hour and four 
minute (yes, I counted the min-
utes) viewing 
of the low bud-
get-turned-
smash 
hit 

“Sharknado” 
series’ fourth 
installment, 
I 
contacted 

my editor in 
a 
desperate 

plea to end the 
torture. Dear 
god, please let it end.

In 2013, the world was intro-

duced to a bizarre, yet strangely 
enthralling concept: a “sharkna-
do.” And surprisingly, the first 
film gained a major following, 
mostly stemming from the kind 
of guilty pleasure viewing that 
goes hand-in-hand with a Syfy 
production. It’s easy to spend a 
lazy Sunday at home with the 
often ridiculous and out-of pro-
portion movies the channel is 
infamous for. This time, however, 
it’s become just too ridiculous to 
be anything short of painful. 

“Sharknado 4: The 4th Awak-

ens” begins with an intro à la 
“Star Wars,” but in a manner that 
would draw cringe from even the 
most mercurial fan of the fran-
chise. With the scrolling yellow 
letters littering the screen, we 
brace ourselves for the pain. The 
fourth movie begins five years 
after the events of the third movie, 
“Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!” that 
premiered in July of 2015. Fol-
lowing the film, fans were called 
upon to decide the fate of April 
(Tara Reid, “American Reunion”) 
via Twitter hashtags for #April-
Lives or #AprilDies, respectively.

First, there’s Shark World, an 

entire Las Vegas hotel dedicated 
to sharks that’s about to get hit 
by the first, of many, sharknados 
during two long hours. At this 
point, Fin Shepard (Ian Ziering, 
“Dancing With the Stars”), sens-
ing the oncoming storm, sets out 
to save his newlywed son (Cody 

Linley, “Hoovey”) from skydiving 
into a sandstorm of sharks, which 
ensues a mid-air car landing and 
a wild ride on the Treasure Island 
pirate ship. I wish I was kidding.

Usually, these movies are ridic-

ulously over-the-top, but there 
are too many aspects that stand 
out against the poorly-generated 
CGI for it to be easily dismissed 
(for example, April’s terminator-
style body, which enables her to 
run a distance of approximately 
30 miles by plugging herself into 
a wall outlet like an iPhone). Or, 
the fact that a sharknado began 
in Las Vegas and miraculously 
migrated to Niagara Falls in 
the span of a day. Or maybe the 
chainsaw store that conveniently 
lined up eight fire extinguish-
ers against a fence when needed. 
Maybe even the unacknowledged 
death of a newlywed wife via fly-
ing sharks? I could go on all day. 
The point is, “Sharknado 4” fails 
to succeed in creating an equal 
balance between a popcorn movie 
event and a bad production, which 
its 
predecessors 
miraculously 

managed to pull off with rela-
tive ease and success. It all boils 
down to one logical conclusion: 
“Sharknado 4” tried to impos-
sibly pack a multitude of things 
in a two hour span, ultimately 
losing its audience as one thing 
progresses into another at a ridic-
ulous pace. With little character 
development to go off of in the 
fourth installment, Syfy instead 
chooses to jam in sharknados and 
action 
sequences 
everywhere. 

As a result, the pain and “dear-
god-please-make-it-stop” mantra 
crescendoes to unbearable lev-
els, even for something so crazy 
as a “Sharknado” franchise film. 
After the first hour passed and 
the dust-sharknado progressed 
into a boulder-sharknado, cow-
sharknado and an oil-sharknado, 
which morphed into a fire-shark-
nado and later progressed into 
a 
lightning-sharknado-turned-

nuclear-sharknado, I lost all hope 
that the film could be brushed off 
as another run of the mill Syfy 
production.

In creating so many “-nados” 

to fill in for character introduc-
tions and growth, the film lost 
an essential concept the first film 
touched on: family. In the previ-
ous three films, Fin Shepard was 
on a mission to save his loved 

ones from the sharknado event. 
There was motivation and plot to 
keep the movie running forward. 
However, this installment feels 
sloppy and lazy, opting instead 
for more action sequences and 
aimless wandering rather than a 
set direction. Whether this was 
intentional is unclear, but the 
change in gears certainly didn’t 
work for the fourth installment. 
Running from Las Vegas to Texas 
to Kansas to Chicago and ending 
up in Niagara Falls via a falling 
house created an unsavory expe-
rience for viewers. They already 
made us believe in a sharknado, 
but a sharknado that can trek 
cross-country? Seems a little 
unrealistic.

After their Kansas house was 

uprooted and they rode the winds 
to Chicago, the end was finally 
coming into sight. Amid dry ref-
erences to popular pop culture 
and a surprising lack of good 
old-fashioned celebrity deaths 
(because that’s why we’re really 
here, right?), the film seemed 
to reach a conclusion, sparked 
from the deaths of multiple major 
characters, who, for your infor-
mation, were eaten by increas-
ingly larger sharks in a grotesque 
Russian nesting doll fashion. 
They were then swallowed by the 
endangered blue whale, who just 
happened to be hanging around 
Niagara Falls at the time, because 
otherwise its presence would 
make absolutely no ecological 
sense. In the meantime, April 
uses her cyborg abilities to fly 
into the falls after her five-year 
old son, who thinks his real mom 
is a shark, and save him from the 
rapids. After only just returning 
to solid ground, the child picks 
up a well-placed tiny chainsaw 
and proceeds to cut open the 
nesting doll of sharks and whales 
to unearth the remainder of his 
family members. Seriously, does 
nobody watch this kid? Any-
way, the movie ends quite sud-
denly with Nova’s (Cassie Scerbo, 
“Make it or Break it”) return on a 
flying Eiffel Tower, which leaves 
the franchise open for another 
installment next July. Although, 
in the meantime, I’ll be praying 
that we won’t have to witness a 
“Sharknado 5,” because I’m hon-
estly out of ideas. What could 
possibly follow a nuclear-shark-
nado?

‘iiiDrops’ fresh

By HARRY KRINSKY

Daily Arts Writer

“You take a little Biggie and a 

little Big L, add an adolescent on 
the corner with packs to sell. You 
take a little Em and 
Andre 3k, and guess 
what you got, the 
2016 2Pac, back and 
improved.”

The verse — or 

rather, 
the 
really 

scorching hot take — 
comes from the 10th 
track of Joey Purp’s most recent 
mixtape, 
iiiDrops 
(pronounced 

“Eye Drops”). Purp is a little over-
zealous in his comparisons, largely 
because he overrates his bars by 
putting himself in such company 
— but at the same time, it’s also 
what rappers do. The line is off-
base mainly because of who Purp 
compares himself to rather than 
making the comparison at all. Purp 
isn’t necessarily a mix of Big L, Big-
gie, Eminem or Andre3000. Rath-
er, he embodies the likes of Jay Z, 
Kendrick Lamar, a dash of Kanye 
West — and sure, a bit of Big L too. 
The mixtape’s first song, “Morn-
ing Sex,” sounds like a mix of Ye’s 
“Devil in a New Dress” and Jay Z’s 
“Encore” if that isn’t proof enough 
for you.

Purp is a member of the Save-

money Crew, a large, loosely linked 
Chicago based collective of rappers 
and hip-hop artists that features 
the likes of Chance the Rapper and 
Vic Mensa. Prior to iiiDrops, Purp 
had been rather quiet, having last 
released a project in 2012. In the 
time between his mixtapes, Purp 
saw his fellow Savemoney brethren 
abruptly ascend to varying levels of 
fame (some arguably reaching the 
top of the rap game, depending on 
how much you enjoyed Coloring 
Book). iiiDrops reflects this brood-
ing period in Purp’s life. It’s effi-
cient, consistent and anything but 
repetitive, an especially impressive 
feat for an 11 track mixtape.

In his time spent away from the 

limelight, Purp manages to craft 
something distinctly new school 
with iiiDrops. And I don’t mean 
that in the sense of being a trippy, 
synthy, 
sampling-Mario-noises-

while-autotune-flexing 
mess. 

Rather, it’s new school in the sense 
that embodies the classic sounds 
of ’90s rap, but ’90s rap that was 
obviously made with the help of a 
MacBook Pro. Purp exists within 

the ’90’s boom bap tradition with-
out restraining himself to it, testing 
musical boundaries with nuanced 
beats and unique flows between 
tracks and choruses. It’s a subtle 
play on convention, which is (ironi-
cally) brave in the current day rap 
climate.

All this comes to a head on “Pho-

tobooth,” the halfway point in the 
album — and, by far, the project’s 
most complex track. The beat shifts 
three different times and cuts out 
in a variety of places. By my 10th 
listen I can’t decide if the scratchy-
screechy sound makes me want to 
plug my ears and hide or vigorously 
headbang to the song. The bars 
match this purposeful confusion — 
it’s pissed off, celebratory, socially 
aware, serious and funny.

Then there is “Girls @,” which 

features a Chance verse that 
reminds everyone that Chance is, 
first and foremost, the face of Save-
money. “Girls @” is fun. It’s the 
kind of song that might play at a 
bar, but the kind with strange, pre-
tentious paintings on the wall and 
an atrium with ferns (but still a bar 
I’d love to go to). At first, the single 
feels out of place. It’s happy, basic, 
and a song simply about Purp and 
Chance repeatedly asking “where 
the girls at.” It lacks some of the 
frustration and anger that the rest 
of the tape teems with. There’s a 
perfectly reasonable argument that 
the single doesn’t belong on the 
tape, but it’s also possible the light-
hearted digression is exactly what 
the project needs. iiiDrops ventures 
to paint a picture of a community 
and of the kind of life within that 
community, and “Girls @” is a 
light-hearted facet of that illustra-
tion.

Ultimately, iiiDrops introspects 

and reflects. Something happened 
between 2012 and 2016 for Purp. 
Maybe it was seeing his Savemoney 
friends like Vic and Chance suc-
ceed in bringing their more socially 
aware music to the masses. Maybe 
it was realizing a need for profun-
dity in his music. Whatever it may 
be, Purp’s transformation conveys 
a type of rapper who’s confident 
in his convictions and unafraid 
to tackle the kind of heavy com-
mentary needed in today’s hip-hop 
scene. iiiDrops might get lost in the 
shuffle of 2016’s rap mega-drops, 
but the tape finds itself in more ear-
nest company than other similar 
projects that have been released 
this year.

attributed 
her 
victory 
to 
her 

constituents’ satisfaction with her 
frequently 
dissenting 
opinions, 

particularly in her push for greater 
transparency regarding a proposed 
Amtrak project in Ann Arbor. “This 
whole issue about the transparency, 
which erupted a couple of months 
ago, really made people worried,” she 
said. “Why should local government 
be secretive on an issue that should 
be publicly discussed and publicly 
debated? I really cared about checks 
and balances; I really cared about 
transparency. I strongly believe in 
these values too. … Just that one issue 
of transparency tipped the scale for 
us.”

The three-way Ward 5 race 

between 
Krapohl, 
Lipson 
and 

Giannola was the closest of Tuesday 
night, with Krapohl pulling ahead of 
Lipson by fewer than 100 votes.

Krapohl expressed relief after 

the final ballot count was clear and 
told the Daily his victory affirms 

the popularity of his pragmatic and 
non-partisan leadership style among 
voters.

“There was a large turnout, more 

than what is normal, so people 
have said the direction of what they 
think is important and that did not 
necessarily fall in line with what my 
challengers were saying,” he said.

Krapohl’s 
opponents 
both 

conceded the voters of Ann Arbor 
had made their choice.

“I think that this was a very 

substantive, 
honest 
and 
fair 

campaign,” Lipson told the Daily 
following the release of the election 
results. “He won fair and square and 
that’s what it’s all about. The people 
have made their decision. He is a 
competent and honest guy. We had 
policy disagreements and the people 
made their choice.”

However, 
Giannola 
also 

re-affirmed her policy differences 
with Krapohl.

“I don’t feel like Graydon did a 

great job last year,” she said. “But 
if they vote him back in you get the 
official that you vote for.”

administration of Michigan and laid 
out an agenda focused on funding 
for public education, environmental 
protection, 
LGBT 
equality 
and 

government transparency. However, 
he also acknowledged the challenges 
in implementing his agenda posed 
by the Republican-dominated state 
government and firmly stated that 
he would fight for a Democratic 
majority.

“We have so much work to do 

in a state that has gone so far in the 
wrong direction over the last six 
years,” Rabhi declared. “A state 
that has eroded its public education 
system, and taken down the quality 
of our Great Lakes, and our air and 
our environment. A state that has 
discriminated against those that 
are gay or transgender or lesbian in 
our own communities. We live in 
a state where some are succeeding 
but not everyone. A state where 
transparency is not a priority and 
where democracy is not something 
that is accesible to everyone. We here 
in this room will change that.”

“This state is not about those 

values. This state is about clean air 
and clean water. This state is about 
treating everyone fairly. This state 
is about making an economy that 
works for everyone and that our 
public education system is funded 
so that we can invest in the future of 
our state, of our nation, of our world. 
... Today isn’t about me, today is 

about Ann Arbor, today is about our 
state and today is the beginning of 
our effort to take back the Michigan 
House of Representatives to turn it 
blue!”

However, 
Rabhi 
also 

acknowledged that the current 
Republican majority in the state 
legislature poses a challenge to his 
policy goals. Therefore, Rabhi said 
he would need to take a bipartisan 
approach 
while 
also 
reforming 

state-level governance to push for a 
Democratic majority.

“In order to do those things we 

first need to change the way our state 
is structured,” he said, listing off 
campaign finance reform to limit the 
power of political action committees, 
improved transparency that would 
subject the Governor of Michigan 
to Freedom of Information Act 
requests and fighting Republican-
biased gerrymandering as additional 
priorities. 

Rabhi also complimented his 

opponent’s campaign, emphasizing 
the need for political debate in civil 
society 
and 
sympathizing 
with 

Kwasny’s focus on campaign finance 
reform. 

“I think that he ran a great 

campaign,” Rabhi said. “I think it’s 
important in a democracy to have 
multiple perspectives addressed, so I 
appreciate the fact he ran.”

Rabhi raised $51,820 through the 

campaign cycle and spent $18,296. 
Kwasny self-funded his campaign 
with $430 and spent $339.

Kellie Halushka remembered 
fondly for wit and individualism

OBITUARY

By 
BRANDON 
SUMMERS-

MILLER

Summer Managing News Editor

Kellie Halushka, vice president 

of membership of the Inter-
Cooperative 
Council 
in 
Ann 

Arbor, is fondly remembered for 
her involvement at the University 
of Michigan, both academically 
and socially, and for her candid 
spirit. Halushka was a rising 
LSA senior studying English 
who had been accepted to the 
sub-concentration 
in 
creative 

writing.

Halushka, who passed away 

suddenly after an accident July 
10, 2016 at 20 years old, was 

originally from Troy, Michigan.

Halushka served as the vice 

president 
of 
membership 
of 

the ICC as a firm believer in 
intentional 
communities 
and 

creating safe spaces for people to 
openly express themselves.

School of Information senior 

Carolyn Gearig, a longtime friend 
and former Daily staff editor, said 
she would always remember how 
Halushka would keep a positive 
attitude even when she struggled 
in her personal life.

“Even when things were really 

bad she just was also funny and 
really witty,” Gearig said.

“A lot of people say she was 

really the only person who they 

felt 
like 
understood 
them,” 

she said. Halushka will also be 
remembered for her uniqueness 
and dedication to being entirely 
herself.

Recent 
LSA 
alum 
Alex 

Heimbaugh, a close friend of 
Halushka’s, said one way she 
would remember her friend is 
by the way she treated all people 
with a sense of dignity and 
kindness.

“I guess I feel really lucky 

because sometimes this happens 
to people and there’s loose ends 
or people don’t know how they 
felt about them, but we all knew 
Kellie loved us a lot,” Heimbaugh 
said. “She was good at that.”

solution,” Assari said. “If you 
undo the effects of education on 
number of chronic conditions or 
the progress of (CMC), education 
would still have some effect on 
mortality. The way education 
and the way race influence 
mortality may have similarities 
and differences.”

Julia Carter, an epidemiology 

student at the University of 
Pittsburg, has been working with 
Assari for her summer internship 
through the Michigan Institute 
for Clinical and Health Research 
in the Immersion in Health 
Disparities Research Program.

Carter said she and Assari see 

racial disparities like these in 
every aspect of health. However, 
aside from the factors that could 
play a role in the risk of mortality 
mentioned in Assari’s study, 
Carter said she thinks culture is 
another element that needs to be 
considered.

“Culture plays a big part in 

health 
disparities, 
especially 

along race lines,” Carter said. 
“For 
minority 
populations, 

culture isn’t often times taken 
into 
account. 
For 
example, 

obesity — if you go and see a 
primary 
care 
physician 
and 

they don’t take into account the 
contextual factors as to why you 
might be obese or why a minority 
individual might be obese, the 
interventions proposed are not 
going to be effective.”

Carter agreed with Assari’s 

findings 
that 
race 
and 

socioeconomic status work both 
together and separately.

“Race 
and 
(socioeconomic 

status) 
are 
so 
interlinked,” 

Carter said. “It’s so hard to 
separate those two because they 
go so hand in hand. At what 
point do you know if this is a 
race thing or a (socioeconomic 
status) thing, given that race 
and (socioeconomic status) are 
linked?”

Additionally, 
Carter 
said 

showing 
different 
stratified 

levels of socioeconomic status 
— rather than limiting research 
to simply poor versus wealthy — 
is crucial in showing a negative 
progression in health and chronic 
conditions.

companies. 

“I think the benefit of academic 

accounting, in at least my part 
of it, is we are very unbiased,” 
Shakespeare said. “We provide 
neutral 
perspectives 
of 
how 

the world works and what the 
information is. I think in that 
regard, being neutral observers 
helps inform standard setters. 
… If we can improve on efficient 
capital allocation, then I think the 
economy is better off.”

Both 
the 
Center 
and 

Shakespeare 
have 
a 
central 

mission to help people understand 
the relevance of accounting within 
a business.

“We want to create people 

who will be thought leaders 
in accounting, whether it be 
Ph.D.s, whether it be practicing 
accountants,” 
Shakespeare 

said. 
“Having 
a 
really 
deep 

understanding of what I would 
call the institution of accounting — 
the world of accounting — is really 
important in trying to identify 
how do you attract the very best 
into accounting.”

Entrepreneurship – Bridging 

Gaps

Peter 
Adriaens, 
University 

professor of entrepreneurship, was 
hired by the University in 1992, but 
he did not begin his career at the 
Ross School of Business. Instead, 
he was a professor of civil and 
environmental engineering in the 
College of Engineering, working to 
develop engineering technologies 
related to sustainability efforts.

Yet, Adriaens said he realized 

that for his “applied research” to 
be considered in the marketplace, 
he had to first consider business 
models. 
Adriaens 
soon 
made 

the 
switch 
from 
engineering 

to business, hoping to teach 
entrepreneurship to engineering 
students, where business models 
are designed based on the types of 
investments they could receive.

Following 
his 
work 
with 

entrepreneurship, Adriaens made 
one final transition to teaching 
finance 
to 
design 
financial 

technologies and create finance 
models — an area in which he 
continues to work today.

Adriaens uses his roots in 

environmental 
engineering 
in 

conjunction with his knowledge 
of finance to work on a number 
of projects, including the Global 
CleanTech Cluster Association. 
Adriaens, 
co-founder 
of 
the 

Switzerland-based 
association, 

said his primary focus with the 

company is to provide global clean 
technology.

With 
more 
than 
10,000 

companies 
in 
27 
countries 

worldwide incorporating the use of 
54 economic development clusters 
— geographic concentrations of 
firms that address the common 
needs of the businesses within 
the cluster — Adriaens said he 
helps develop regional economic 
activities that help countries and 
regions transition from traditional 
fossil fuel economies to green 
economies. Some green economies 
include water sustainability, LED 
lighting and coastal energy, which 
refers to developing companies on 
coastal locations to create energy.

“Including the U.S. and in 

Europe and Canada and all the 
developed economies, we have 
over the last 100 years essentially, 
in an unlimited way, accessed 
all natural resources, all natural 
capital,” 
Adriaens 
said. 
“The 

natural capital — this is water, this 
is soil, this is anything that you use 
that nature provides you, trees, 
water, soil quality, biodiversity. 
We’ve used it to actually create 
wealth from that. But we have not 
really sustained that or reinvested 
in that.”

Because 
of 
this, 
Adriaens 

listed a number of reasons why 
Global CleanTech is crucial to 
all countries involved, including 
environmental policy decisions as 
well as from a moral and financial 
standpoint. Adriaens mentioned 
a recent emphasis on circular 
economy, 
which 
produces 
no 

waste and pollution since the 
products reenter the system. 

“Right now we’re really starting 

to think about circular economies, 
so these are economies that not 
only take out but also put back in,” 
Adriaens said. “And the question is 
how one does that from a financial 
perspective, how one does that 
from a material perspective, how 
one does that from an emissions 
management perspective.”

Adriaens is also the CEO of the 

KeyStone Compact Group, which 
is an asset management firm that 
designs and structures investment 
funds or pension funds to make 
investing in sustainability easier 
globally. Adriaens said he hopes 
to continue this type of work by 
developing financial technology 
to analyze the financial risk 
of an investment opportunity, 
using the design and execution of 
new investment instruments to 
bring a variety of funds into the 
sustainability space.

Real drops Chelsea at Big House

By ORION SANG 

Summer Managing Sports Editor

There were questions about 

whether this year’s International 
Champions Cup match between 
Chelsea 
and 
Real 
Madrid 
at 

Michigan 
Stadium 
would 
live 

up to the expectations placed 
upon it after the 2014 contest 
between Manchester United and 
Real — a game that set the U.S. 
soccer attendance record with a 
reported crowd of 109,318 people 
and featured appearances from 
Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and 
Wayne Rooney.

Saturday’s game, in contrast, 

had less star power on both 
sides. For Real, Ronaldo, Sergio 
Ramos, Karim Benzema, James 
Rodriguez and Luka Modric all sat 
out, leaving Marcelo as the most 
recognizable player in the lineup. 
Meanwhile, Cesc Febregas and 
Diego Costa were out for Chelsea, 
while Thibault Courtois and Eden 
Hazard came in as substitutes long 
after the game had already been 
decided.

There was also the threat of bad 

weather looming over Saturday’s 
contest — Ann Arbor was deluged 
with rain for most of the morning, 
with thunderstorms forecasted for 
the afternoon.

But when 3 p.m. rolled around, 

the rain had stopped and Michigan 
Stadium was filled to the brink 

with fans eagerly supporting their 
teams, regardless of whether the 
superstars were on the pitch or not. 
The 2016 ICC contest drew 105,826 
people, good for second on the all-
time U.S. attendance record list.

And in the end, even while 

missing most of its regular lineup, 
Real Madrid emerged with a 3-2 
victory over Chelsea, thanks to the 
efforts of Marcelo.

The left back opened up the 

scoring in the 19th minute with 
a strike from just outside the 
box, curling the ball past Chelsea 
goalkeeper Asmir Begovic.

Marcelo struck again just seven 

minutes later, when he made 
a run down the left side of the 
pitch, squeezed past two Chelsea 
defenders and put the ball into the 
short side of the goal, a display of 
skill that drew roars of applause 
from the crowd.

The left back was the catalyst 

once again for his team’s third 
goal. Playing give-and-go with his 
teammate, Marcelo made another 
run before leaving the ball for his 
teammate Mariano Diaz — who 
promptly unleashed a strike from 
ten yards outside the box into the 
net.

“Maybe physically, (Marcelo) 

wasn’t as good as the rest, but in 
the field he’s been the best,” said 
Real Madrid manager Zinedine 
Zidane after the game. “It’s been 
a joy to watch him play. Since 

Montreal, it’s been spectacular to 
see him. He’s an important player, 
and as you can see he’s the captain. 
It’s the captain’s job to give an 
example. Overall, I’m happy with 
his match, and ultimately, I think 
that’s the idea: to get our rhythm 
back.”

After its listless first half 

performance, Chelsea outscored 
Real 2-0 in the second half. Star 
forward Hazard entered the game 
in the 67th minute and made his 
presence known, scoring two goals 
in the 80th and 90th minutes, 
respectively.

But for the Blues, it was too 

little, too late, and Real captured 
a victory in its second game at 
Michigan Stadium after a 3-1 loss 
to Manchester United in 2014.

A day after saying he wanted to 

see a better performance from his 
team, it appeared Zidane got his 
wish.

“Ultimately, what we were 

looking for was to start strong,” 
Zidane said after the game. 
“Overall, I’m satisfied with how 
the team played. We’re in the 
preseason, but we’re looking to see 
something more from the team, 
and I’m happy with what I saw.

“The 
team 
is 
doing 
well. 

We’ve seen the team get better. 
Obviously, we’re ten days from the 
Super Cup, but I think what we’ve

Nike rally celebrates

new Michigan apparel

If 
you 
asked 
“Fab 
Five” 

member 
Jimmy 
King 
about 

Sunday night’s Nike Welcome 
Rally in Ann Arbor, he would say 
the city was partying like it was 
1989 — the last time the Michigan 
basketball team won a national 
championship.

As Michigan’s contract with 

Adidas expired and the Nike 
and Jordan Brand era began, 
hundreds of people filled the 
street in front of The M Den on 
State 
Street 

to 
celebrate 

the 
new-look 

Wolverines 
— 

with some eager 
fans showing up 
as early as 8:20 
a.m.

Both current 

and 
former 

Wolverines 
alike 
attended 

and spoke at the 
Welcome Rally, including King, 
former 
Wolverine 
linebacker 

Lamarr Woodley and former 
Heisman 
winner 
Desmond 

Howard, all of whom were 
dubbed as “special guests.” Other 
speakers 
included 
members 

of the Michigan football such 
as head coach Jim Harbaugh, 
De’Veon Smith and Rashan Gary, 
and players from the basketball 
team like Derrick Walton Jr.

“I’m pretty sure Jordan’s gonna 

treat us right,” Walton said. “I like 
Jordan as a brand and it’s good 
for our school and will generate 
some 
more 

excitement. 
It 
shows 
the 

power 
of 
the 

Block M.

“There’s a lot 

of 
excitement 

around here and 
I’m just happy to 
be a part of it.”

Much 
of 

the 
hype 

surrounding 
the 
Michigan 

football approaching the 2016 
season was made very apparent, 
especially when Harbaugh took 
the stage, as definitive talk about 
winning a national championship 
came to light.

“I have lived 52 years, a lot 

of those years in Ann Arbor, 
and I have never seen anything 
like this,” Harbaugh said to the 
crowd. “This is what Ann Arbor 
will look like after we win a 
championship.”

Similar 
sentiments 
were 

shared by King, who also added: 
“We look good. We feel good. We 
play good.”

Michigan 
Athletic 
Director 

Warde 
Manuel 
was 
also 
in 

attendance at the Welcome Rally. 
The event had been a long time 
coming for Manuel, who signed 
the deal with Nike — then the 

largest school 
apparel deal in 
the country — 
just three days 
into his tenure 
at Michigan.

“It’s 
really 

special to see 
all 
the 
fans 

here excited to 
take the next 
step in what 
we’re doing. I 

didn’t know what to expect (from 
the rally), but for Michigan, this 
is the way we do things.”

Aside from the high-caliber 

speakers, other aspects of the 
festivities included performances 
from the Michigan Marching 
Band and cheer team, a video 
introducing the transition to the 
crowd and free food for those 
patiently waiting for the store to 
open.

For the apparel itself, the 

power of the Nike “swoosh” made 
its presence known. The clothing 
line included a number of similar 

styles 
seen 

in the Adidas 
clothing, 
but with the 
different logo. 
The 
notable 

variations were 
seen 
in 
the 

shoes, 
which 

brandished 
the 
famous 

“Jumpman” 

logo, and a long-sleeve shirt 
designed by Harbaugh featuring 
the “Jumpman” logo and Block 
M.

And when the clock struck 

midnight and the doors of The M 
Den opened, it was finally official: 
Nike was back in Ann Arbor.

“This is what Ann 

Arbor will look 

like after we win a 
 

championship.”

“It’s special to 

see the fans here 
excited to take the 

next step.”

Harbaugh, ‘M’ unveil jerseys

By ORION SANG

Summer Managing Sports Editor

DETROIT — At midnight Sunday, 

Michigan’s new apparel contract 
with Nike began, culminating in a 
release event that took place in Ann 
Arbor.

Tuesday, the festivities continued 

— albeit on a smaller scale — when 
Nike and Jordan Brand revealed the 
new Michigan football jerseys with 
a private presentation at the Ford 
Piquette Avenue Plant in Detroit.

It was just another step in the 

beginning of a new era of Michigan 
apparel.

The event began with Michigan 

alum Dana Jacobson, a sports 
anchorwoman at CBS, addressing 
the crowd before handing the mic 
off to several other speakers.

“These 
two 
brands 
coming 

together has created something 
powerful,” said Larry Miller, the 
president of Jordan Brand. “What 
started as a phone call between 
Michael 
Jordan 
and 
Coach 

Harbaugh has come to fruition 
today.”

Michigan 
Athletic 
Director 

Warde Manuel also attended the 
event and praised Nike as the “best 
apparel company (and) a leader in 
the nation.”

“The Jordan Brand continues the 

legacy of Michael Jordan,” Manuel 
said. “But Michael builds his legacy 
off the same qualities that we have 
here at the University of Michigan. 
The 
legacy 
transcends 
sports, 

and we are excited to be the first 
football team in the country to wear 
the Jumpman on the field.”

Following Manuel’s comments, 

Jacobson led the group into a room 
containing several display cases of 
new Michigan Nike outfits — and 
also former Michigan Heisman 
Trophy winner Charles Woodson, 
one of the special guests on hand for 
the jersey unveiling.

“When you think about Michael 

Jordan (and) Jumpman, you think 
about excellence,” Woodson said. 
“You think about the University of 
Michigan as a university and as a 
sports team, and you think about 
excellence. It goes back to a long 
time ago, way before me and you.

“I feel like right now we have our 

swagger back. It’s all about looking 
good and feeling good. That’s what 
that Jumpman on our jersey means 
to us.”

Later, head coach Jim Harbaugh 

— who attended the event dressed 
in apparel that he had helped 
design himself — explained the 
backstory of how Michigan and 
Nike’s partnership came to be 
as Michigan’s new jerseys were 
revealed to those in attendance.

Harbaugh detailed how his son 

Jay, the tight ends and assistant 
special teams coach, approached 
him and suggested that Michigan 
“should be Jordan.”

Then, Harbaugh got a call from 

Michael Jordan himself — someone 
who Harbaugh described as “one of 
the most evolved human beings in 
the world.”

During 
their 
conversation, 

Jordan 
said 
that 
he 
wanted 

Michigan to be the first and only 
football program in the world to 
carry the Jumpman logo — and 

Harbaugh was all-in.

“I said, ‘You had me at hello,’ ” 

Harbaugh said of the conversation 
between him and Jordan. “We’ve 
been working for this for a very 
long time. The other thing that 
(Jordan) said that I thought was 
profound was that, ‘You know what 
Nike means to Oregon (and) you 
know what Oregon means to Nike. 
Michigan can mean that to Jordan.’ 
And that I thought was powerful, 
that I thought was very profound.

“(The conversation) was about 

the team. (Jordan) respects the 
University of Michigan. He respects 
his own school, North Carolina. 
He’s very fond and talks about that 
as well. But I could feel that he 
respected Michigan. He respected 
the fact that we are pouring our 
heart 
and 
souls 
into 
making 

Michigan football great. That was 
a compliment on the highest level.”

The jerseys themselves don’t look 

much different from those worn 
last year in Harbaugh’s first season 
as coach. The main difference is 
the presence of the Jumpman logo 
above the number and a matte 
finish on the helmets.

But much of the design is the 

same, and that’s apparently the way 
Harbaugh wanted things — though 
he left open the possibility of future 
changes.

“We’re not going to change the 

uniform design at this time, but 
I stand open to (Nike and Jordan 
Brand’s) ideas,” Harbaugh said. 
“Some people just think of things 
better than other people do. They 
obviously do a tremendous job at 
the highest level.”

A fitting marriage

The fans started showing up at 

8:20 — in the morning.

They trickled in as the day went 

on, setting up lawn chairs and 
gobbling burritos from the Chipotle 
next door.

And as the sun set in Ann Arbor, 

the line only grew bigger as fans 
eagerly awaited The M Den’s 
release of brand new Michigan Nike 
products. At midnight, the school 
officially began its new contract 
with the apparel giant and severed 
ties with Adidas.

When the intersection at Liberty 

was blocked off, State street was 
flooded by hundreds of people — 
some there to buy the newest gear, 
the rest there simply to take it all in. 
But at what point could things have 
been considered to be over the top?

It could’ve been when a stage 

more apt to be seen at a music 
concert was set up across the store.

It could’ve been when members 

of the marching band, dance, 
basketball and football teams all 
arrived to entertain the crowd.

And it most certainly could’ve 

been when Michigan head coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh 
arrived 
and 

transformed the once docile crowd 
into a writhing mass of outstretched 
hands, pleading for the head man to 
pay attention to them with cries of, 
“Jim! Jim!”

Though Harbaugh would later 

climb upon the stage and tell the 
crowd that the rally was unlike 
anything he’d ever seen in his life, 
he seemed at home Sunday night. 
If anything, he delighted in the 
attention, at one point walking 
straight through the crowd and 
slapping five with as many hands as 
he physically could.

And 
that’s 
the 
thing: 
For 

Michigan, the switch to Nike and 
Jordan Brand and all its surrounding 
hoopla is only representative of the 
change that Harbaugh has brought 
to the football team in the short time 
he has been here.

For a team that was once missing 

— for lack of a better term — swag, 
Harbaugh and his Wolverines have 
certainly gotten their swagger back 
now.

It was just two years ago when 

Michigan’s former head coach 
Brady Hoke publicly apologized 
after a humiliating 35-11 beatdown 
at the hands of rival Michigan State 
for “poor sportsmanship” — former 
linebacker Joe Bolden had run 

out onto Spartan Stadium before 
the game and driven a tent stake 
through the middle of the field in 
a brazen act meant to inspire his 
team.

Now, 
could 
you 
imagine 

Harbaugh apologizing for anything 
at all?

In just a year and a half, he has 

drawn criticism from what feels like 
most of the college football world — 
for both his antics on the field and 
off of it.

He has led a march through the 

South in both offseasons, holding 
satellite camps in the backyards of 
his SEC counterparts and, when 
challenged by those same SEC 
coaches (and even the NCAA), he 
has taken shots at his criticizers on 
Twitter — something Nick Saban 
and ‘The Georgia Coach’ can tell 
you about.

His football team has only 

followed suit. Last season, Michigan 
bounced back from a total of five 
victories in Hoke’s final year to win 
10 games, and the Wolverines ended 
the season with a 41-7 romp over a 
highly-rated SEC team. This year, 
with most contributors returning, 
they appeared poised to compete 
for a spot in the College Football 
Playoff.

And what better way for Michigan 

to show off its new demeanor than 
with Nike, the flashiest and most 
popular apparel brand?

If Adidas and its sometimes 

tacky, alternative jersey designs 
represented the Michigan of old, 
Nike and Jordan Brand represent 
Harbaugh’s Michigan.

In your face, with a bright 

variation 
of 
maize, 
dubbed 

‘amarillo.’ Proud and unafraid to 
show it, with a large block M and 
the famous Jumpman logo printed 
everywhere and on everything.

Everyone knows the swoosh 

when they see it — just like how 
they’ll 
know 
Harbaugh 
and 

Michigan, 
whether 
through 

watching the coach mean mug his 
way through a music video or by 
watching the Wolverines fight their 
way through the Big Ten.

Has it been mentioned yet that 

Michigan will be the first team to 
ever wear the Jordan Brand logo 
onto the gridiron? And that Michael 
Jordan himself will be there at 
Michigan Stadium as an honorary 
captain in the matchup against 
Hawaii on Sept. 3?

And if that seems over the top at 

all, at this point — after this night — 
it shouldn’t.
