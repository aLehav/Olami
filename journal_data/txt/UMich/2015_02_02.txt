Close isn’t enough

Snow Day is the 

second on campus in 

nearly 40 years

The University has canceled 

classes and events on Monday due 
to inclement weather. This is the 
second time since 1978 that the 
University has canceled classes for 
weather conditions.

The Division of Safety and Secu-

rity issued a notice of “emergency 
reduction in operations” late Sun-
day evening. The alert said classes 
and events would be canceled 
through 6 p.m. The University’s 
hospitals will remain open. Class-
es have also been canceled at the 
University’s Dearborn and Flint 
campuses, though those campuses 
cancel classes at their own discre-
tion.

According 
to 
the 
National 

Weather Service, southeast Michi-
gan is predicted to experience 
subzero wind chill and wind gusts 
up to 30 miles per hour on Sun-
day night, and eight to 12 inches of 
snow by Monday morning. Tem-
peratures are expected to reach a 
high of 15 degrees and a low of zero 
degrees.

The last time the University 

canceled classes due to inclement 
weather was Jan. 27, 2014, the first 
time in 36 years.

Following the closure, the Uni-

versity established an updated poli-
cy to address concerns raised by the 
faculty, staff, students and parents.

At a meeting of the Senate Adviso-

ry Committee on University Affairs 
last January, University Provost 
Martha Pollack said the University 
did not have a substantial plan in 
place to guide the closure of classes.

“By the time it became clear that 

we were facing an extraordinary 
weather event, we realized that we 
didn’t have appropriate mechanisms 

Prosecutor says 
police employed 
self- defense in 

residential shooting

By ANASTASSIOS

Protesters marched through 

downtown Ann Arbor on Satur-
day in response to the decision 

by the Washtenaw County Pros-
ecutor’s Office not to press crim-
inal charges against Ann Arbor 
Police Department Officer David 
Ried following the fatal shooting 
of 40-year-old Ann Arbor resi-
dent Aura Rosser.

The protest was led by an 

organization known as Ann 
Arbor to Ferguson. Participants 
arrived at City Hall around 4:30 
p.m. the day after the decision 
was announced.

Friday evening, the prosecu-

tor’s office announced that Ried 

employed “lawful self-defense” 
when he shot Rosser. The report 
said Rosser charged toward Ried 
and the officer accompanying 
him with a knife, and refused to 
put it down when ordered to do 
so by the police officers.

Protesters marched holding 

pictures of Rosser while others 
held signs reading “Black Lives 
Matter” and “End Police Vio-
lence.” The protesters chanted 
“No Peace No Justice” as well 
“Hey hey ho ho, racist cops have 
got to go” and “Show me what 

democracy looks like? This is 
what democracy looks like.”

The protest moved from City 

Hall to East Washington Street, 
blocking traffic on Liberty Street 
and State Street, and ultimately 
ended on Main Street. The pro-
testers held a moment of silence 
on the corner of Huron and Main 
streets before returning to City 
Hall where the protest conclud-
ed shortly after 6 p.m.

Science met art on Friday 

night at the second annual Sci-
ence as Art Contest Exhibition 

and Awards.

The exhibition and award 

ceremony, co-sponsored by the 
Science Learning Center and 
Arts at Michigan, provides an 
outlet for undergraduates to dis-
play and receive recognition for 
their accomplishments, show-
casing not only their artistic 
ability, but also their conceptual 
and creative understanding of 
science.

Organizers sectioned off the 

Hatcher Graduate Library to 

make room for all 23 submis-
sions as well as the four winners 
from the previous year’s con-
test, with entries ranging from 
poetry to sculptures and digital 
renderings. The submissions 
encompassed various scientific 
topics including entropy, neu-
rons and malarial infection.

“Our goal is to actively engage 

undergraduates in the arts and 
sciences and to provide an out-

Processes may lead 
to further action 
beyond suspension 
for resort damage

By MICHAEL SUGERMAN 
and GENEVIEVE HUMMER

Daily News Editor 

and Daily Staff Reporter

Six University Greek life 

chapters who reportedly caused 
damage at two Michigan ski 
resorts 
have 
already 
been 

suspended by their national 
chapters. Now, they will face 
a number of processes that 
could yield further punishment 
beyond the suspension of their 
chapter events, philanthropy, 
recruitment and social activi-
ties.

One of the main issues at 

play is vandalism and property 
damage. The Sigma Alpha Mu 

fraternity has been the focus 
of attention after causing dam-
ages at Treetops Resort, which 
according to manager Barry 
Owens, could cost between 
$85,000 and $100,000 to repair. 
Owens said the resort plans to 
press charges in the incident.

Officials with the Boyne 

Highlands Resort have esti-
mated damages there will total 
about $25,000.

The damages could qualify as 

“willful and malicious destruc-
tion of property” under Michi-
gan state penal code.

In a scenario where enough 

students were on the trip to 
reduce individual damages to 
between $200 and $1,000, each 
student would face misdemean-
or charges. These could result 
in up to one year in prison, “a 
fine of not more than $2,000 or 
three times the amount of the 
destruction or injury, whichever 
is greater,” or both.

Multitude of cultures 

continue to mold 

city’s neighborhoods

By NEALA BERKOWSKI

Daily Staff Reporter

As The Michigan Daily contin-

ues to watch and report on Detroit 
shaping its future, we want to 
reflect back on how the city got 
here. Our hope for this week’s 
Detroit History Series is that read-
ers learn something new about the 
city and, in turn, better understand 
what’s to come.

Detroit is known for its rich 

past. Much of this richness can be 
attributed to its history of immi-
gration and migration — move-
ments that continue to shape the 
city today.

The French founded Detroit 

in 1701. Before their arrival, the 
region experienced a constant 
turnover of people, Joel Stone, 
senior curator of the Detroit His-
torical Society, said. Groups of 
Native Americans would occupy 
the area, then would move west 
or north as other tribes and clans 
came from the east.

“While there were many more 

Native Americans living around 
here, tens of thousands of them, 
as opposed to a few thousand 
French, it really remained a 
French town even as other groups 
started coming in,” Stone said. 
“That being said, it was pretty 
early on that we started to get 
a pretty multicultural group of 
folks of here, meaning mostly 
Western Europe.”

Early Detroit also attracted 

other populations. JoEllen Vin-
yard, a history professor at East-
ern Michigan University who 
specializes in U.S. social and 
immigration history, said major 
groups such as the Germans, Irish 
and British immigrated to Detroit 
in the early 1800s due to factors 
including cheap land, affordable 
homes and better opportunities.

Vinyard said there is a general 

immigration theory that the “pull 
is stronger than the push,” mean-
ing people often chose to immi-
grate to Detroit when its economy 

was strong, rather than because 
they were forced out by circum-
stances in their home country.

“You could come in pretty 

much at your skill level and move 
up because they needed work-
ers,” Vinyard said. “It was a medi-
um city and it was a family city 
where they could afford a home. 
For Catholics, like the Irish, 
for example, it was much more 
friendly than Boston or Philadel-
phia or New York because it was 
already a Catholic town with a 
French base.”

Vinyard added that not every-

one moving to Detroit was 
“straight off the boat.” Between 
1800 and 1830, many migrated 
to Detroit from New York and 
communities throughout New 
England. Some learned about 
opportunities in Detroit as they 
moved around, while others came 
to follow family that had already 
settled in the city.

Most often, people traveled to 

Detroit in small groups or on their 
own, Vinyard said. In some fami-
lies, one brother would go first 
and then send money back for the 
others to come. Less frequently, 
people traveled in larger groups 
with people from their town, or 
in a group sponsored by a church.

Vinyard said many immigrants 

tried to straddle becoming Amer-
icanized and retaining their orig-
inal culture.

“The 
immigrant 
genera-

tion didn’t want their children 
to become too Americanized 
because they were afraid they 
would lose them. They would 
move away from the culture and 
they wouldn’t be a part of the 
family,” Vinyard said. “But you 
could see in all of these groups 
they would say, ‘But we are the 
ones that are marching in the 
Fourth of July parade. We’re 
the ones who are celebrating 
the American holidays in visible 
ways. We’re teaching our chil-
dren about George Washington.’”

Stone said the next wave of 

immigrants consisted predomi-
nantly of Polish, Italians, Greeks 
and Belgians by the 1870s. Prior 
to the turn of the century, Detroit 
started seeing people from the 
Middle East, Eastern Europe and 

Asia.

“Before the Civil War, they 

were coming for the land, and 
after the Civil War, Detroit’s 
industrial economy really took 
off,” Stone said. “So that’s when 
they started coming for the jobs. 
Or maybe they thought they were 
coming for land but when they got 
here they realized that the factory 
jobs were so good.”

Vinyard said by the early 

1900s, the Polish became one of 
the major groups that settled in 
Detroit. The Polish, along with 
people from Central and Eastern 
Europe, were often recruited to 
work in various industries and 
factories in Detroit. Many Pol-
ish moved to Poletown, and later 
to Hamtramck in 1910 after the 
Dodge Brothers opened a new 
automotive plant.

African 
American 
migra-

tion has also played a large role 
in Detroit’s diverse population. 
LaNesha 
DeBardelaben, 
the 

vice president of assessment and 
community engagement at the 
Charles H. Wright Museum of 
African American History in 
Detroit, explained that African 
Americans began migrating to 
Detroit in a sizable number as 
early as 1850, when the Fugitive 
Slave Law was enacted, forcing 
people of color to leave the Deep 
South and seek freedom in north-
ern states.

DeBardelaben 
said 
African 

Americans migrated to Detroit 
again in large numbers during 
World War I and World War II. 
Called the Great Migration, this 
movement was largely fueled by 
the availability of jobs, with men 
typically working in factories 
while women found domestic 
work.

“Detroit has had a long history 

of African Americans migrat-
ing into the city,” DeBardelaben 
said. “African Americans began 
to migrate in the teens during 
World War I when factory jobs 
opened up for African Ameri-
cans as a part of the war effort. So 
there was a Great Migration into 
Detroit in the teen years, num-
bers skyrocketed, and then again 
during World War II. Until that 
time many African Americans 

still remained in the South.”

DeBardelaben said many Afri-

can Americans also migrated to 
Detroit because of social reasons 
like racism and discrimination in 
the South.

“Their livelihood and quality 

of life was threatened with rac-
ism and discriminatory practic-
es,” she said. “Blacks could not go 
to the schools they wanted. They 
could not even go to the public 
library in the South. So it was 
more than just an economic fac-
tor. There were social conditions 
that propelled them to leave the 
South and to settle in what they 
thought would be advantageous 
opportunities in the North.”

African Americans faced simi-

lar problems in Detroit. Blacks 
were prevented from purchasing 
homes in certain neighborhoods. 
Highly skilled African Americans 
were not given as many oppor-
tunities for work and were often 
left with less desirable work. 
Debardelaben said African Amer-
icans had to learn to rely on their 
own communities.

“African 
Americans 
who 

migrated here were able to find 
pretty much what they needed 
in those Black neighborhoods in 
terms of pharmacy and business 
and lawyer,” she said. “The Black 
community was self-serving.”

DeBardelaben added that Afri-

can Americans have had a major 
impact on social change — an 

influence that continues today. 
In the 1850s, Detroit’s African 
American community drew the 
attention of national figures such 
as Frederick Douglass and John 
Brown. In the 1900s, they created 
their own agencies and centers.

“It was Detroit’s Black women 

who organized orphanages and 
homes for the elderly and com-
munity centers for young people 
because they were not allowed 
to go to the white YMCAs,” 
DeBardelaben said. “They creat-
ed their own agencies and centers 
and petitioned for equal opportu-
nity. Detroit is a strong city and 
it’s strong because the African 
Americans could not accept sec-
ond class citizenship.”

Currently, Mexicans and Arabs 

are two of the city’s most notable 
immigrant groups, though both 
communities have been immi-
grating to Detroit for hundreds 
of years

Arab immigration to Michi-

gan, which first began in 1898, has 
steadily increased in recent years, 
according to Sally Howell, assis-
tant professor of history and Arab 
American Studies at the Univer-
sity’s Dearborn campus.

In 1921, the area’s first struc-

ture built specifically as a mosque 
opened in Highland Park, a 
block away from the entrance to 
Ford’s Model-T factory. It joined 
Detroit’s existing Greek Orthodox 
and Maronite Catholic churches, 

which 
were all built by Syrian-Lebanese 
migrants.

Howell said while many of the 

earlier immigrants came seeking 
economic opportunity, the Arab-
Israeli Wars, civil wars in Lebanon 
and Yemen and more recent con-
flicts in Iraq brought many immi-
grants to Detroit seeking refuge.

In the 1950s, jobs in the auto 

industry caused the Chaldean 
and Palestinian populations to 
grow in the city, Howell said. A 
decade later, in the 1960s, the 
Arab-Israeli War and a war in 
Lebanon brought many refugees 
to Detroit. Howell said people 
emigrated from Arab countries 
like Lebanon, Iraq, Palestine, Jor-
dan and Syria.

Between 2000 and 2010, Arab 

immigration increased by 35 per-
cent, which means the population 
overall is still majority immi-
grant, Howell said. Yet, she said it 
is important to remember that the 
Arab community is an integral 
and integrated part of southeast 
Michigan, with the first immi-
grants having helped build the 
auto industry and the city itself, 
while second- and third- gen-
eration Arab Americans are dis-
persed throughout the economy.

west Detroit, a neighborhood 
board, said Mexicans and Latin

Veterans group raises funds for local programs

Veterans Benefit 

By TANAZ AHMED

Daily Staff Reporter

Dressed in their finest, residents 

from across Washtenaw County gath-
ered in the Michigan Union Ballroom 
for the sixth annual Student Veterans 
Benefit Dinner on Friday.

The gala and silent auction was 

hosted by the University’s chapter of 
the Student Veterans of America to 
raise funds for the Washtenaw County 
Veterans Treatment Court, a pro-
gram that employs a treatment-based 
approach — rather than the traditional 
sentencing — for veterans impacted by 
substance abuse or mental health.

The annual benefit dinner is held to 

raise awareness about issues veterans 
face.

“Correctly identifying those who 

need help first is often the most life-
sustaining step,” said LSA senior and 
SVA President William Kerkstra in 
his opening remarks. “There are few 
causes more worthy than helping vet-
erans meet their psychological and 
substance abuse needs.”

Student Veterans of Michigan was 

founded in 2007 by Derek Blumke, 
then a 26-year-old Air Force veteran, 
during his first year at the Univer-
sity.

Blumke created the organization 

because he said he initially felt dis-
connected from his civilian peers 
and realized that other student vet-
erans may have felt the same way. He 
later went on to found the national 
organization, Student Veterans of 
America, in 2008.

“When we first got here it was 

challenging, being isolated and not 
feeling like you have a sense of con-
nectedness with others,” Blumke 
said at the dinner. “Albeit we don’t 
have that experience today because I 
know that the University is trying to 
change and better itself.”

Other attendees at the gala agreed 

that prior to 2007, the University did 
not have adequate resources to sup-
port student veterans.

Ryan Bouchard, a Business grad-

uate student and a veteran who 
also attended the University for his 
undergraduate degree, said Uni-
versity officials initially noted that 
available services were not exten-
sive because of the University’s 
small population of student veter-
ans.

“Why do you think?” he said. “The 

University’s services were not up to 
par with some of their peers.”

Along with SVA, the University 

now has a Veterans and Military 
Services Program that helps veter-
ans and other military personnel 
smoothly transition into the Univer-
sity community.

Judge Christopher Easthope and 

University Regent Kathy White (D) 
also spoke at the event.

Easthope, the judge for the 15th 

District Court in Ann Arbor, under 
which the Washtenaw County Vet-
erans Treatment Court falls, spoke 
on the experiences of veterans in the 

justice system.

“Veterans courts address the real 

and ongoing cost of war,” Easthope 
said. “I firmly believe that we owe 
the men and women of our country 
the moral obligation to return them 
as close to whole as possible.”

White, a lieutenant colonel in 

the U.S. Army Reserve, discussed 
diversity in the military as well as in 
higher education. White said univer-
sities must strive for the same kind of 
diversity that the military possesses.

“They pick people based on merit 

and the needs of the military at the 
time,” White said. “This process 
tends to actually produce a very 
diverse group of people who end up 
working together.”

She also mentioned the impor-

tance of trust in maintaining diver-
sity, which she said the military 
instills in soldiers.

“Reconciliation 
and 
common 

understanding cannot be attained in 
an environment of distrust,” White 
said. “So, in some ways without trust 
there’s a perception of injustice no 
matter what the facts are.”

If individual damages were to 

total between $1,000 and $20,000 
each, the individuals would face 
felony charges — which could 
result in up to five years in prison, 
“a fine of not more than $10,000 
or three times the amount of the 
destruction or injury, whichever is 
greater,” or both.

However, no individuals have 

yet been identified, at least pub-
licly, as culpable for the damages.

Beyond state law, E. Royster 

Harper, vice president for stu-
dent life, said in an interview last 
week with The Michigan Daily 
the students will also face Univer-
sity-centric procedures to address 
their actions.

The 
Statement 
of 
Student 

Rights and Responsibilities is a 
set of rules to which all students 
who attend the University are 
bound. In its introduction, the 
document states that the Univer-
sity’s standards of conduct extend 
beyond the University and Ann 
Arbor “only if the behavior poses 
an obvious and serious threat or 
harm to any member(s) of the Uni-
versity community.”

Harper 
said 
individuals 

involved in damages to resorts 
exacted not only physical dam-
age, but also reputational damage 
to the school — as there has been 
national attention surrounding 
the issue.

“How do we as an institution do 

what’s right?” she asked. “Lots of 
people were harmed by the irre-
sponsible behavior. So then the 
question becomes, ‘How do you 
repair that harm?’ And that’s what 
we’re trying to think about.”

Student violations to the State-

ment of Student Rights include 
“stealing, vandalizing, damaging, 
destroying or defacing Univer-
sity property or the property of 
others” — which the resorts have 
accused all six Greek organiza-
tions of doing.

The process under the State-

ment of Student Rights would 
likely deal with individual stu-
dents, and subsequently these stu-
dents would have three options for 
resolution of the issue. However, 

because individuals have not yet 
been identified, the proceedings 
are as of now undetermined.

If the students came to a “gen-

eral agreement” with the involved 
resorts about how to resolve the 
conflict, they could discuss poten-
tial sanctions before entering 
into a formal agreement whereby 
they accept “responsibility for the 
alleged violations of the State-
ment.”

Informal 
conflict 
resolution 

processes “such as mediation, 
facilitated dialogue and restor-
ative justice circles” are available. 
However, these are highly unlike-
ly to be employed given the large 
monetary damages inflicted in 
this situation.

The students could have a 

University-affiliated 
hearing 

arbitrated by either a Resolution 
Officer or a Student Resolution 
Panel. These hearings could take 
place in a group or on an individ-
ual basis. They would ultimately 
“result in findings of fact” and 
subsequent recommendations for 
punishment, which would then 
be reported to Dean of Students 
Laura Blake Jones. Jones has the 
final say on either accepting or 
modifying the recommendations.

Potential 
punishments, 

referred to in the Statement of 
Student Rights as “sanctions/
interventions,” include a “formal 
reprimand,” which is essentially 
a warning; “restitution” which 
is “reasonable compensation for 
loss” through community service, 
money or material replacement; 
suspension from coursework and 
University activities; and most 
severely, expulsion from the Uni-
versity.

SOAR, 
a 
University 
body 

housed in the Center for Campus 
Involvement, is meant to create a 
formal relationship between the 
University and its student organi-
zations. Its accountability proce-
dure outlines how the University 
responds to student organizations 
that violate the Standards of 
Conduct for Recognized Student 
Organizations.

University students, faculty and 

staff can bring complaints against 
student organizations through the 
SOAR accountability process.

Any enrolled student, faculty 

Americans are immigrating to 
Detroit to seek refuge from dan-
ger in their homeland.

Thibodeau said some Latinos 

have difficulty finding jobs if 
their education from home isn’t 
recognized in the United States 
or if they are undocumented. In 
these cases, the Latino commu-
nity has been able to support itself 
by establishing its own work.

“We have someone who came 

from Honduras recently and 
she was a teacher in Honduras, 
but obviously that’s not going 
to translate here in America,” 
Thibodeau said. “The Latino 
community does an awesome job 
with really creating their own 
economy, creating their own 
businesses. Usually it’s labor 
work: building up houses, fixing 
up houses, landscaping, they do a 
lot of work in the suburbs and sur-
rounding areas.”

Southwest Detroit is also a 

cultural hub, which helps immi-
grants adjust to life in Detroit, 
Thibodeau said.

“It’s very possible to grocery 

shop, go to school, go to church, live 
in the community and be in this 
insulated cultural community,” he 
said.

Detroit’s 300-year legacy of 

immigration and migration to 
Detroit has contributed to the city’s 
culture and growth, but DeBarde-
laben, who moved to Detroit three 
years ago, said the city continues 
to provide opportunities for both 

newcomers and former residents 
deciding to return home.

“Those Detroiters who leave 

for college, they come back,” she 
said. “A lot of young profession-
als have options of going any and 
everywhere. They can go to L.A., 
New York, Philadelphia, but they 
want to come back to Detroit to 
work because it’s a place where 
they have a passion for and it’s in a 
period of transition and they want 
to be a part of that. People see the 
opportunity to shape a better 
future for Detroit.”

mittee chair for CSG and SAPAC 
volunteer, said the retreat was 
designed to create an environ-
ment conducive to serious dia-
logue around sexual assault on 
campus.

“I think we are fed up with the 

national narrative that is being 
portrayed in the media — and not 
just that, but in our campus,” she 
said.

Diaz alluded to students call-

ing for former Athletic Direc-
tor Dave Brandon’s termination 
from the University, where more 
than 1,000 students gathered in 
protest. Brandon came under fire 
after a series of events, most nota-
bly the Athletic Department’s 
controversial handling of sopho-
more quarter-back Shane Mor-
ris’s concussion in a September 
game against Minnesota.

“Where is that when it comes 

to real, serious issues, such as 
rape?”

From the start of the retreat, 

Anna 
Forringer-Beal, 
co-coor-

dinator of SAPAC’s Networking, 
Publicity, and Activism program, 
emphasized using the word “sur-
vivor” as opposed to “victim” in 
conversations about sexual assault.

“We use the term ‘survivor’ 

instead of ‘victim’ because it’s 
a more empowering term and 
because sexual assault at its core is 
such a disempowering thing, one 
of the ways to regain control is to 
refer to yourself as a survivor and 
show that you have ownership over 
this event,” she said.

On Friday, SAPAC Director 

Holly Rider-Milkovich and Dean of 
Students Laura Blake Jones deliv-
ered a presentation on the Univer-
sity’s Student Sexual Misconduct 
Policy.

“Basically, our policy falls into 

four categories: respect, report, 
respond 
and 
review,” 
Rider-

Milkovich said.

Both went on to discuss the 

definitions of important terms per-
taining to sexual conduct, namely 
consent. She said consent must be 
given on a continuous basis, not 
just once. She also emphasized that 
consent can’t be given by “a person 
who is incapacitated.”

“Students need to be mutually 

agreeing to each step of behavior as 
it’s happening,” Rider-Milkovich 
said.

The speakers also highlighted 

the fact that one in six men and 
one in four college-aged women 
will experience some form of sex-
ual assault. However, Jones said 
because sexual assault is the most 
underreported crime in the United 
States — with about 60 percent of 
cases going unreported — the sta-
tistics can vary depending on the 
source.

LSA junior Jacob Abudaram, 

an LSA representative in the CSG 
Assembly who attended the confer-
ence, said the topics were impor-
tant to discuss given the prevalence 
of sexual assault.

“People think, ‘Well, I don’t need 

to go to these workshops because I 
would never sexually assault some-
one’ and that’s not the right role to 
play,” he said.

The topics discussed at the 

retreat focused heavily on preven-
tion from all parties involved.

For example, LSA junior Don 

Lyons, co-coordinator of SAPAC’s 
Men’s Activism program, led a pre-
sentation Saturday on bystander 
intervention that considered the 
concepts of coercion and sexual 
harassment.

After showing the group an 

advertisement for an episode of 
FX’s “It’s Always Sunny in Phila-
delphia,” in which one character 
discusses isolating a girl on a boat 
so that she will have sex with him, 
Lyons explained coercion as “tak-
ing away someone’s ability to say 
no.”

To curb sexual assault, Lyons 

also said people must take sexual 
harassment more seriously.

“It’s a really horrible thing 

that leads to other really horrible 
things,” Lyons said. “A lot of the 
times this is how someone will 
start exerting their power over 
someone.”

On campus, the topic of sexual 

misconduct has attracted signifi-
cant attention in recent months. In 
October, student protestors called 
on University officials to address 
several demands to address per-
ceived issues in the University’s 
procedures 
to 
combat 
sexual 

assault on campus.

Earlier this month, Univer-

sity President Mark Schlissel, who 
attended a portion of the Culture 
Shift retreat, announced the Uni-
versity’s plans to survey students 
on campus climate surround sexu-
al misconduct and public safety.

of scientific ideas,” SLC Director 
Claire Sandler said in an e-mail 
interview.

The panel of judges was com-

posed of five individuals with 
expertise in a wide variety of 
fields, including science, art, edu-
cation and literature. The submis-
sions were ranked according to 
their scientific basis, originality, 
skill and technique and quality of 
the written explanation.

This year, the grand prize was 

awarded to Art and Design senior 

Sidney Krandall for her piece 
“Progressive Resistance Exercise 
Design Concept,” a pen and ink 
illustration.

Several new categories were 

incorporated for the first time, 
including the People’s Choice 
award, which allowed attendees to 
vote for their favorite pieces.

LSA 
junior 
Ashley 
Miller 

won this year’s People’s Choice 
award for her piece, “Unobjec-
tive Research,” which depicted 
a woman’s face surrounded by a 
mass of long, flowing hair from 
which 
different 
three-dimen-

sional shapes protruded. The hair 
curled into the form of a hand, 

choking the woman. The submis-
sion was done in acrylic paint and 
clay.

“My piece is about doing 

research and how sometimes 
some of the things that you want 
to do in research are not always 
things that you want to do,” Mill-
er said. “It’s really hard to work 
with animals, but you just have 
to look at what comes out of it 
and the good that you’re working 
towards.”

LSA junior Lawrence Chen also 

participated in the exhibition with 
a large piece examining the seem-
ingly chaotic, yet strictly struc-
tured nature of DNA.

“Science and art are both a very 

large part of my life and I see them 
intersect all the time,” Chen said. 
“This competition is exactly what 
I’m looking for. Both bring great 
joy to my life.”

Miller emphasized the impor-

tance of the event in that it pro-
vided a more visual medium of 
science.

“This event is really important 

because it shows people what sci-
ence is doing through more of a 
visual and easier way to get it out to 
people who aren’t particularly sci-
entifically-knowledgeable,” Miller 
said. “It makes it more interesting 
to the everyday person.”

to close the University even if we 
wanted to,” she said. “Closing a 
university is more like closing a 
city than closing a building. You 
can’t just close; there is a hospital, 
there is a police force, there are 
students on campus who need to 
be fed.”

After last January’s cold day, 

the University created a com-
mittee to update its severe-
weather policy. The updated 
policy, released in October, pro-
vides more detailed protocols for 
reducing service in the situation 
of severe weather. To do so, the 
executive director of the Uni-
versity’s Division of Safety and 
Security and the executive vice 
presidents assess the weather 
conditions and provide recom-
mendations to the University 

president, who makes the final 
decision.

Eddie Washington, executive 

director the University’s Divi-
sion of Public Safety and Security, 
wrote in a release that dangerous 
road conditions factored into his 
recommendation to cancel classes.

“Snowfall totals of 12 to 18 inch-

es with high winds are making the 
roads dangerous, especially for the 
many faculty, staff and students 
who live outside the city of Ann 

Arbor,” he wrote.

Despite the closure, Atmo-

spheric 
Sciences 
Prof. 
Perry 

Samson said he will still hold his 
class Extreme Weather, or AOSS 
102. Students were “advised to 
stay home, but can use the class 
Echo360 technology to view the 
live broadcast.”

drivers, who honked as they 
passed the demonstrators. How-
ever, most waited for the protest-
ers to continue down the street. 
Police arrived when the protest 
reached the intersection of Huron 
and Main streets. Officers did not 
interfere with the protest and 
allowed the group to continue 
marching.

Saturday’s rally was not the 

first in recent months. In Decem-
ber, 
demonstrators 
convened 

on the Diag and outside Winter 
Commencement for “die-ins” to 
protest police brutality.

Shae Ward, Rosser’s younger 

sister, participated in the march 
and thanked the protesters. In 
an interview Saturday with The 
Michigan Daily, Ward said she 
appreciated the turnout. Ward, 
who lives in Detroit, noted that 
this is her first time in Ann Arbor 
since Rosser’s death.

“I’m disappointed, but I hate 

to say that it is to be expected, 

unfortunately, with our history 
in this country,” she said. “I am 
hoping for a change. I am hoping 
that the American people — right 
now, 2015 — will wake up and 
see what’s going on. And It’s not 
about class and color. It really is 
about money.”

Ward described Rosser as a 

kind, compassionate, soft and 
highly educated woman who 
loved Ann Arbor. She added that 
while Ann Arbor is supposedly a 
liberal city, racism is prevalent in 
the AAPD and that citizen groups 
have spoken about this.

“My hope is that I can get 

strong enough to speak for her,” 
Ward said. “Because I know her 
person. She would have never 
attacked Officer Ried. She would 
have never made him feel that 
he would have to take her life to 
defuse the situation. That is just 
outlandish. It totally is outland-
ish.”

Rackham 
student 
Austin 

McCoy, a member of Ann Arbor to 
Ferguson, said he hopes that the 
protest raised awareness about 
the issue.

“We believe that since the 

prosecutor made the announce-
ment so late last night that they 
were trying to evade accountabil-
ity,” he said. “So this is partly to 
show that we have some strength 
and to try hold people responsible 
but then we hope that this action 
is one of many. We hope to actu-
ally put out some demands and go 
from there.”

“I think what people can do 

is join organizations like ours, 
educate themselves about the 
criminal justice here, especially 
it’s inequities when it comes to 
people of color in this country and 
make sure they are involved.”

Darius Simpson, a student at 

Eastern Michigan University who 
participated in the march, said he 
hopes the protest inspired further 
action rather than just personal 
feelings of accomplishment.

“This is a first step rather than 

the end all,” Simpson said, “I am 
hoping folks leave with inspira-
tion and curiosity, because the 
reality is that people don’t know 
what to do. They’re not doing 
stuff because they have no idea 

where to go and who to talk to.”

In a statement released Fri-

day evening on Facebook, Ann 
Arbor Mayor Christopher Taylor 
(D) noted the ongoing necessity 
of combating racial injustice, but 
also said he believes the officer’s 
actions were justified in this situ-
ation.

“The events of that night of 

course were a tragedy, but not 
a tragedy of racism, which is 
loathsome 
and 
unacceptable 

and contrary to everything Ann 
Arbor and the Ann Arbor Police 
Department stands for,” he said. 
“The events of November nine 
were a tragedy of mental illness 
untreated and drug use unabated. 
They were a tragedy of a society 
that does not devote the resourc-
es necessary to give help to those 
who require it.”

Protesters also demonstrated 

against police brutality at the 
Ann Arbor City Council meeting 
in December. During that meet-
ing, the Council voted to equip 
AAPD officers with body cam-
eras, which are expected to be in 
operation by the summer.

member or staff member at the 
University can file an official 
complaint form at the Center for 
Campus Involvement within six 
months of the incident. These 
complaints must include back-
ground facts showing which 
Standards of Conduct have been 
breached and a request for relief.

Complaints can be referred 

to the student governing body 
that has jurisdiction over that 
organization if the body has a 
written procedure for investiga-
tions, though some cases may be 
referred to the Office of Student 
Conflict Resolution, which can 
conduct their process currently 
with the SOAR process. The direc-
tor of the CCI can also refer the 
complaint to a specific academic 
unit for an informal resolution.

In this case, the “student gov-

erning body” that the complaint 
would be referred to is the Greek 
Activities Review Panel, the judi-
cial branch for the University’s 
Greek Councils — the Panhellenic 
Association, the Interfraternity 
Council, the National Pan-Hellen-
ic Council and the Multicultural 
Greek Council.

GARP, which includes up to 

eight justices and one chief jus-
tice from each Greek council, is 
in charge of investigating and 
resolving misconduct allegations 
against any chapter or individual 
members affiliated with the Greek 
Councils.

Complaints submitted to GARP 

can be filed by any individual or 
organization and must provide 
written details of the violation.

Within seven days of receiving 

the complaint, the chief justices 
must review the complaint and 
determine one of the following 

outcomes: to dismiss the case, call 
for a mediation or call for a hear-
ing.

Mediation requires the com-

plainant and the defendant to 
reach a mutual agreement, facili-
tated by the chief justices. If the 
mediation succeeds, the agree-
ment will be put in writing and 
enforced by GARP.

If not, the complaint proceeds 

to a GARP hearing. In the event 
of a hearing, the complainant car-
ries the burden of the proof and 
the involved parties are expected 
to present relevant evidence and 
testimony.

After all testimony and evi-

dence is presented, the justices 
deliberate until a decision is 

reached, requiring two-thirds of 
the justices to agree.

The final agreement is put into 

writing, provided to all involved 
parties and filed as a public record.

Similar to the Student State-

ment of Rights and Responsibili-
ties, GARP’s imposed sanctions 
vary depending upon the case, but 
can include: a letter of reprimand, 
restitution 
charges, 
monetary 

fines, community service require-
ments, educational programming, 
or more severely, probation, sus-
pension or expulsion from mem-
ber’s respective Greek Council.

The final decision can be 

appealed by submitting a written 
notice of appeal within seven days 
of receiving the GARP decision to 

the Greek Appellate Board, which 
comprises two chapter presidents 
from each of the Greek councils, 
randomly selected by the chief 
justices, and a ninth member who 
is selected from the list of GARP 
members uninvolved in the origi-
nal case.

A two-thirds vote is necessary 

to overturn GARP’s decision.

Jones, the dean of students, is 

charged with imposing sanctions 
based on the student governing 
body’s decision, which in this case 
is GARP. Though the dean of stu-
dents will focus the recommenda-
tion in most cases, she can deviate 
from the recommended sanctions.


W

alking along State Street the other 
day, I noticed a bright big banner 
proudly displayed above the steps 

to the Michigan Union, 
advertising — for lack of a 
better term — the Counsel-
ing and Psychological Ser-
vices center. Glancing up 
at the sign, I remembered 
the first time I had gone to 
CAPS earlier this year.

I had decided I probably 

needed to see someone long 
before I actually called to 
make an appointment. A 
bunch of ridiculous, though 
probably common, fears prevented that initial 
phone call. What if my friends see me walk in 
there? What if this appointment shows up on 
my academic records? (It doesn’t, by the way.)

But mostly, I was preoccupied with what I 

thought registering for a CAPS appointment 
meant — that I couldn’t take care of my prob-
lems on my own; that I had a problem to take 
care of in the first place; that something about 
me was abnormal, problematic and in need 
 

of fixing.

Ironically, these were not concerns of mine 

when I went to the doctor to get antibiotics 
for a sinus infection or to the dermatologist 
for a skin check.

So instead of making an appointment when 

I knew that I probably should have, I waited 
until seeking help was pretty much necessary 
to deal with the stress that had accumulated 
as a result of harder sophomore classes and 

involvement in several organizations. And 
while I had done my best to keep all of this 
to myself, I finally told my mom what had 
been going on. She suggested that I “go talk 
to someone about it.” Eventually, I did.

It didn’t take long for the psychiatrist to 

figure out what was going on. She identi-
fied my sometimes-inability to get work 
done, sit through lectures and stay on task as 
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder — 
 

something I had been told before but didn’t 
want to hear.

I didn’t like the idea of a mental health 

“disorder,” and I didn’t really see the con-
nection between stereotypical images of dis-
ruptive, struggling 10-year-olds and my high 
GPA. One of the most helpful things CAPS did 
was help me challenge the negative picture I 
had developed about mental health issues and 
their treatment. A major focus of subsequent 
sessions at CAPS centered on the positive 
aspects of ADHD.

Recently, I came across a cover letter I had 

written earlier that fall. I recognized many 
of the self-identified “strengths” — quick 
thinking, problem solving skills, creativ-
ity — that I mentioned in the letter as some 
of the positive aspects that the CAPS worker 
had mentioned. Growing up in a culture that 
labels mental health disorders as a mark of 
abnormality, I had never thought to consider 
that there might be accompanying attributes 
 

as well.

Eventually, that first CAPS appointment led 

to an effective treatment plan and a reduction 
of many of the issues that had brought me

Not a weakness

W

e have to stop acting 
surprised when we hear 
reports of Greek life 

“misconduct.” 
When 
we 
hear 

about demolished 
hotel 
rooms, 

pledges 
forced 

to swim in pools 
of shit, women 
degraded, 
sexu-

ally 
assaulted, 

raped and so on, 
we tend to react 
in what we think 
is 
the 
humane 

and 
moralistic 

way. We say: “My god, how could 
this happen? How terrible! How 
disgusting! Whoever did this harm 
ought to be punished! How could 
this have happened?”

But do we consider the assump-

tions and prejudices already at play 
in our supposedly moralistic reac-
tion? Do we consider how our good 
liberal reaction to routine Greek life 
horrors actually supports the very 
organizations and acts that we think 
we’re opposing and denouncing?

Whenever we speak about Greek 

life “misconduct,” we have to put 
the “misconduct” in quotes. In the 
face of the regularity of the “mis-
conduct” (hazing, violence, sexual 
assault, etc.), one can no longer seri-
ously claim that these events are 
out of the ordinary for Greek life. 
When we react to these horrors as 
if they were scandals, as the Greek 
life organizations, universities and 
the media say they are, we’re imply-
ing that they are out of the ordinary; 
that these events deviate from the 
normal functioning of the Greek 
life system; and that Greek life as a 
whole (that is, Greek life as an insti-
tution and system) is innocent.

These horrors seem to occur so 

regularly that, ironically, the true 
scandal for Greek life would be if 
one weekend there were no binge 
drinking, violence, hazing or rape. 
The lack of “misconduct” would 
constitute a true Greek life scandal.

We all know — that is, anyone 

even remotely familiar with today’s 
Greek life knows — that the horrors 
we read about in the newspapers 
constitute only a small fraction of 
the total “misconduct.” Aren’t we 
all aware that the prohibitions 
against certain “misconduct” in 
Greek life are a joke? Don’t we 
know that within the prohibitions 
against, say, hazing, is the expec-
tation that the prohibition will 
 

be violated?

It insults the intelligence of the 

public when Greek life and univer-
sity spokespeople react with their 
phony shock and surprise at the 
most recent hazing “scandal” or 
whatever. They know fully well that 
hazing goes on. But it’s this false 
surprise on the part of the organi-
zational leaders in response to the 
incriminating reports that allows 
the hazing to continue.

A major step forward for the 

reformation of Greek life would be 
if, in response to the next report 
of University-affiliated Greek life 
misconduct, University President 
Mark Schlissel stood on his podi-
um, shrugged his shoulders and 
just said, “Yep, this is how Greek 
life works.”

This, I claim, would be the truly 

compassionate 
and 
progressive 

response: not pretending that the 
plight of these victims (e.g., the vic-

tims of hazing, sexual assault, etc.) 
is out of the ordinary; not pretend-
ing that it’s shocking or surprising 
that this happened to them; and not 
pretending that we don’t know that 
this supposed “misconduct” really 
happens all the time and that these 
horrors occur because of the normal 
functioning of the Greek life system.

For example, we all assumed 

that when the University Greek 
life chapters left for their “ski trip” 
they brought gallons of alcohol and 
ounces of drugs with them (refer-
ring more so to hard drugs, not 
marijuana, which I believe, if used 
without alcohol, might have actu-
ally prevented the extensive prop-
erty damage). Though it’s not every 
year that Greek life at the Univer-
sity causes more than $80,000 
worth of damage to a hotel, most 
of the underlying causes of that 
destruction, like binge drinking to 
the point of belligerence, do happen 
every year — indeed, every week.

What’s most disturbing about 

resort-gate is not the damage 
to property alone: it’s what the 
destruction of property signifies.

Compare this instance with the 

extensive destruction of property 
that took place during the protests 
in Ferguson, Missouri, following 
the grand jury’s failure to indict 
Officer Wilson for the killing of 
unarmed Black teen Mike Brown. 
How did we react to the destruction 
of property in Ferguson?

For many of us it almost consti-

tuted reason to denounce the pro-
test as a whole. Some Conservatives 
even used the looting and rioting to 
argue racist or racialist claims, like, 
“This just goes to show that these 
people (Black) can’t be trusted; 
they deserve their lowly lot in life; 
we need more and stricter policing, 
not less,” etc.

And what about the “ski trip”? 

Why not conclude that these people 
cannot be trusted? Why not more 
policing for them? Shouldn’t we 
be more afraid of rich, white frat 
brothers than of poor, Black urban-
ites? Rich, white Greeks feel they 
are invincible and cause $80,000+ 
worth of property damage without 
even trying.

The protesters in Ferguson who 

destroyed property did so deliber-
ately. What’s more, these riots, even if 
one disagrees with them as a political 
tactic, were at least partly redeem-
able because they were founded on 
legitimate 
discontent 
(economic, 

political, social and otherwise).

The carelessness, ease and non-

chalance with which the Greeks on 
“ski trip” destroyed $80,000+ worth 
of property scares me far more than 
the deliberate destruction of prop-
erty in Ferguson. There is no purpose 
— political or otherwise — and hence 
no excuse for the Greeks’ destruc-
tion of property. The sheer nihilism 
and cynicism of it, and the nihilism 
and cynicism throughout Greek life 
that it exemplifies, is what scares me 
— scares me far more than, say, the 
 

Ferguson riots did.

This seems to fit the larger cul-

tural paradigm of white America’s 
greater fear of the hooded Black 
man robbing a gas station clerk at 
gunpoint than of Big Banks ripping 
off hundreds of thousands of peo-
ple with subprime loans. The clerk 
loses, at most, a few hundred dol-
lars. The victims of aggressive sub-
prime lending lost millions. Who 
are the real degenerates? Who are 

the real criminals?

But — and this may seem coun-

terintuitive given my writing about 
it — I claim that we need not worry 
too much about Greek life. The 
institution cannot survive for long 
in its current form (friends of mine 
in fraternities tell me pledging will 
basically be over within 10 years). 
Greek life depends on high levels 
of organizational secrecy in order 
to function, much like big corpora-
tions do. As we move further into 
the age of social media and smart-
phones, Greek life’s organizational 
secrecy will become increasingly 
difficult to maintain.

Its first enemy is itself. I’m not 

afraid of generalizing the Greeks as 
a bunch of drunk idiots. As drunk 
idiots who (when drunk) don’t 
understand the necessity of secrecy 
for their institution’s survival, they 
expose and incriminate themselves 
and bring themselves closer to their 
own destruction.

There’s a video — we’ve all seen it 

— shot on a cellphone camera by an 
anonymous Pike brother, showing a 
drunk woman giving the brother a 
blowjob as he asks her, “What’s the 
best fraternity at MSU?” She says, 
“Pike.” What did we learn from this 
video? Ironically, that, by any and 
all standards, Pike is definitely not 
the best fraternity at MSU. Not just 
because the girl, being drunk, could 
not legally give consent, but that 
this brother violated the highest 
imperative for a “good” fraternity 
in our era: secrecy.

A “good” fraternity, by which 

I mean a fraternity with a good 
chance of survival, is one that 
does all the normal frat stuff (dis-
respects women, sexually assaults 
them, etc.), but does so in secrecy. 
The Greeks, it seems, are having 
difficulty accepting the fact that 
our world no longer accepts such 
violence, misogyny and sexism. The 
Pike video, I claim, exemplifies the 
reason why the ideology of Greek 
life will be Greek life’s own ulti-
mate destruction. Greek life can-
not reconcile its need for secrecy 
with its own stupidity (brought on 
largely by routine alcoholic stupor). 
So, while we should continue to 
resist Greek life and advocate for its 
reform, we should not be too con-
cerned, because, in the long term, 
Greek life will likely destroy itself.

Now — and, again, this will seem 

somewhat surprising to my reader 
— I am not totally opposed to Greek 
life. To clarify, I’m not condemning 
or accusing every chapter or every 
Greek of rape, hazing, etc.; I’m 
condemning the institution that 
systematically produces these hor-
rors. I have many friends in Greek 
life and they tell me — and I’ve also 
seen it for myself — that the institu-
tion is not all bad.

When we talk about Greek life, 

we have to make certain abstrac-
tions and generalizations, and, in 
doing so, I fear that we may too read-
ily dismiss the genuinely good ele-
ments of this institution — such as 
friendship — and the genuinely good 
experiences of many of the Greeks. 
Nonetheless, I maintain that the 
institution as a whole is sick. I advo-
cate for reform and resistance to 
Greek life while also knowing that 
the system is already on a trajectory 
toward its own destruction.

FROM THE DAILY

M

arijuana has become a modern crusade for some, with 
medical marijuana rights and a growing number of 
advocates for the free use of the substance across the 

nation gaining traction. To certain lawmakers and drug enforcement 
advocacy groups, it’s the proverbial thorn in their side that doesn’t 
seem to be going away anytime soon. Further adding to the debate, 
the American Academy of Pediatrics recently revised its policy 
on marijuana, with its main concerns targeted toward marijuana 
usage among adolescents. The AAP advocates that pediatricians 
should be extremely conservative with prescribing marijuana to 
teen patients, except in the case of debilitating conditions; they are 
also calling for the removal of marijuana from the federal Schedule 
I drug classification. However, they advise against legalization. 
The AAP’s stance is cautiously optimistic, with the potential to 
help many people throughout the nation. Similarly, the effects of 
removing marijuana from Schedule I could potentially lead to the 
legalization of marijuana in the United States by increasing research 
and reducing stigma.

Because marijuana is classified as Schedule I 

— meaning there’s no accepted medical use and 
it has high potential for abuse — there has been 
very little research done on its effects. This fact 
is specifically cited in the AAP’s report as the 
leading contributor to the medical community’s 
ambiguity on the substance’s benefits. The 
reason why there hasn’t been sufficient 
research on marijuana doesn’t have to do with 
the medical community, but rather the federal 
government’s refusal to remove marijuana from 
the Schedule I substance list, created as part 
of the 1970 Controlled Substances Act. Under 
this legislation, which was the forerunner of 
Nixon’s “War on Drugs,” Schedule I substances 
are “the most dangerous drugs of all the drug 
schedules with potentially severe psychological 
or physical dependence.” Schedule I includes 
dangerously addictive drugs such as LSD, 
heroin and ecstasy.

While to some it may seem laughable that 

marijuana is regarded in the same light as 
hard drugs by the federal government, it’s a 
serious concern for patients across the country 
who are waiting with bated breath for any 
new research on marijuana that could be 
potentially beneficial for a litany of different 
medical concerns. On a smaller scale, more 
research could also be constructive for our 
own university and its hospital system. With 
a plethora of research tools on or affiliated to 
campus, ground-breaking marijuana studies 
could be conducted if the drug were removed 
from the list of most dangerous controlled 
substances in the United States.

There are other gains from removing 

marijuana from the Schedule I list, such as 
removing 
unnecessary 
stigma 
associated 

with the substance. The description of 
Schedule I substances is clearly not indicative 
of marijuana’s true nature. If marijuana 
were to remain on the Schedule I list, then 

any and all offenses related to the substance 
could carry undue ridicule from potential 
employers or anyone who would have access 
to an individual’s records. For those with petty 
misdemeanors on their record, this kind of 
attention and unwarranted scrutiny can be 
hugely detrimental to the job search, forever 
damaging their career prospects. Moreover, 
the horrible racial disparity in our nation’s 
prison system could be alleviated, at least in 
part, as well as the overall overpopulation of 
jails across the United States with the removal 
of marijuana from the Schedule I substance list. 
Since offenses related to those drugs typically 
carry the worst sentences, some of which are 
required to follow harsh federally mandated 
guidelines and cost taxpayers billions of dollars 
every year.

The AAP’s new position on marijuana is 

certainly a step in the right direction, but more 
action must be taken by the government to help 
increase the amount of information about this 
highly contested drug and to allow its seemingly 
numerous benefits to be enjoyed by the adults 
of this country. The AAP recognizes, along 
with many others, that marijuana can have 
detrimental effects on the developing mind; if 
marijuana were to be decriminalized or even 
legalized, only adults who are 21 and older should 
be allowed to possess and use the substance.

The onus is now on the federal government 

to remove marijuana from the Schedule I 
controlled substance list to allow for more 
research that will help remove incorrect 
notions associated with the drug and allow 
for patients to reap the medicinal benefits of 
a substance that has already been legalized 
for medical uses in 23 states and the District 
of Columbia. With these reforms, the United 
States will certainly be better off and reach a 
new high in the ongoing dismantling of the war 
on drugs.

there in the first place. To say I’m 
glad I went is an understatement 
… but at first I didn’t want to, and 
absent encouragement from my 
family, I probably wouldn’t have.

According to the National Insti-

tute of Mental Health, 19.6 percent 
of adults ages 18 to 25 had a mental 
illness in the United States in 2012. 
If your eyes are blue or green, it’s 
more likely that any given student 
your age has a mental illness than 
shares your eye color. But despite 
its prevalence, mental health issues 
aren’t among the things that most 
people — including myself — are 
comfortable talking about. There is 

still so much judgment, stereotyping 
and negativity surrounding mental 
health illnesses and their treatment.

Which is exactly why I decided to 

write this column. I know that some 
people reading this column might 
view me differently once they’re 
done. But, despite that, many, many 
students could benefit from mental 
health care even though it’s rarely 
talked about in social situations. I 
know that I don’t talk about it with 
most of my friends. I also know that 
many of them have, at one time or 
another, really needed someone to 
talk to about the plethora of pres-
sures that come with being a stu-

dent at such a difficult, oftentimes 
 

competitive school.

And because so many of us don’t 

talk about mental health, it’s easy 
to presume that it isn’t an issue 
that affects a significant number 
of students. So if you think you 
might benefit from an appointment 
at CAPS, please make one. It’s not 
a sign of weakness, lack of capabil-
ity or abnormality — it’s a resource. 
And though they may not want to 
discuss it, many of your peers are 
using it, too.

“Is that Llewyn Davis?”
‘Parenthood’ ends
in perfect form

Series finale of 
tearjerking show 
ties it all together

By CHLOE GILKE

Managing Arts Editor

There’s a certain art to crafting 

the perfect series finale. The ideal 
finale has to wrap everything up 
in a satisfying 
way, but still 
leave a few ends 
untied. It has 
to 
boil 
down 

seasons’ worth 
of 
storylines 

and 
episodes 

into one final 
message, one ending that gives 
meaning to the hours that viewers 
devoted to watching this show, 
instead of, you know, working or 
spending time with their families.

“Parenthood” 
successfully 

accomplishes the basics, but also 
does something rare with its series 
finale. More than just validating 
hours spent in front of the TV, it 
reinforces the relationships that 
viewers maintained with these 
characters and this family who 
felt as breathing and real as the 
ones sitting on the couch next to 
them. “Parenthood” is a notorious 
“mom show,” a supreme cry-fest 
because of its relatability. As the 
Bravermans embrace on a baseball 
field in the sunshine, the lines 
between real family, real grief and 
real love disappear into the script 
and the images.

It’s not a TV show anymore. 

This is family.

“Parenthood” 
begins 
this 

perfect hour of television by 
setting 
up 
Sarah’s 
(Lauren 

Graham, 
“Gilmore 
Girls”) 

wedding, bringing the family 
together for this joyful celebration. 
Sarah hastens her plans so her 
ailing father Zeek (Craig T. Nelson, 
“Coach”) could be there to see his 
“favorite” child wed to a kind and 
stable man worthy of her open 
heart and unconditional love. Of all 
the Braverman siblings, Sarah was 
the one to lean on her parents the 
most; she lived in the Braverman 
compound until her parents sold 
the house, and they supported her 
financially until she found a good 
career as a photographer. Before 
her father passes, she wants to 
show him that all his support 
allowed her to find happiness and 
love, one final thank you to all he’s 
given her.

Sarah’s situation finds a parallel 

in her daughter, Amber (Mae 
Whitman, “The Perks of Being a 
Wallflower”). Amber appeared 
to be making all her mother’s 
worst mistakes, getting involved 
with a man who drank too much 
and couldn’t be bothered to hang 
around to raise their child. But she’s 
already on the path to a happier 
future, after her uncle Crosby 
(Dax Shepard, “Hit and Run”) 
offers her a job at his revamped 
Luncheonette recording studio. 
Rather than running away and 
trying to do everything on her own 
like Sarah did, she accepts help 
from her family from the start. At 
the wedding reception, Zeek tells 
Amber that he’d like her to live 
with them for their “third act” 
of life. With Zeek’s finale rapidly 
approaching, this is a double act of 
kindness: Amber has a supportive 

place to raise the baby, and Zeek’s 
wife Camille (Bonnie Bedelia, “Die 
Hard”) will have company once he 
passes.

Their wedding is predictably 

upbeat and beautiful, but even 
more remarkable is how the show 
uses the wedding scenes to weave 
effortlessly 
between 
ending 

narratives for different characters. 
While swaying around the room to 
reception music, Joel (Sam Jaeger, 
“Inherent Vice”) and Julia (Erika 
Christensen, “Swimfan”) decide 
to adopt another child. Though 
they’ve only just reconciled, they 
promise that this is it, that they’re 
a couple and a family and will 
never break again. As he holds 
her while dancing and whispers 
that the child “is already ours,” we 
truly know their union is stronger 
than ever.

Even Max (Max Burkholder, 

“The Purge”) finds his happy 
ending 
at 
the 
wedding. 
All 

season, he’d been chasing after a 
girl who didn’t understand that 
his Asperger’s made navigating 
his crush difficult, and didn’t 
like him back. Max is the acting 
photographer of the wedding, 
but instead of hiding behind his 
camera all night, he goes off to 
dance with a young, friendly 
wedding attendee. The parallel 
between 
Max 
and 
Hank 
is 

striking: Hank (Ray Romano, 
“Men of a Certain Age”), Max’s 
mentor and a fellow Aspie, found 
an understanding and wonderful 
woman to share his life with, 
and when Max looks at his dance 
partner and lets her touch his 
shoulders, it’s evident that Max’s 
future is similarly bright. He’s not 
defined by his disease — he can take 
impressive photos, connect with 
other people and even graduate 
high school. It’s a long way from 
his portrayal in earlier seasons, a 
hopeless burden to his family and 
the “difficult child” that his sister 
describes in her heartwarming 
conversation with him. Leaving 
Max Braverman on this note, that 
he’s got a promising future beyond 
a textbook definition of “high-
functioning,” almost makes up for 
the fact that we won’t get to spend 
more seasons watching him grow. 
Almost.

But 
beyond 
the 
wedding, 

the element linking the entire 
episode together and bringing 
it to transcendent heights was 
its tribute to Zeek. Despite his 
brashness 
and 
averseness 
to 

change, he’s always been the glue 
of the family and the leader of 
Team Braverman. We know going 
into this episode that his heart 
condition is dire, but that doesn’t 
make it any less painful to hear 
Camille calling out his name at 
home and see the look on her face 
when there’s no response. The 
most heartbreaking scene in the 
episode (and possibly the entire 
series) is Zeek sitting like a peaceful 
king in his leather armchair, eyes 
closed but still watching over 
his territory, the home he loved 
so much. After Camille walks 
over to him, the scene quickly 
cuts to a baseball field, where the 
Bravermans spread his ashes and 
play a celebratory game of ball.

The final montage is the 

ultimate eulogy to Zeek: we see 
what accomplishments the rest 
of the Bravermans are up to in 
the years following his death. 
Considering that the rest of the 

episode set the characters down 
these paths, these flash-forwards 
could seem fairly redundant. Joel 
and Julia have four kids, two boys 
and two girls just like Zeek and 
Camille did, and open presents 
on Christmas day with their big 
family. Crosby and Amber record 
in the studio, while Adam (Peter 
Krause, “Six Feet Under”) hands 
a diploma to a cap-and-gown-
clad Max. Camille finally visits 
Chez Marie, the place Zeek told 
her about in the weeks before his 
death, the place they were going 
to visit together. Instinctively, we 
knew where all the characters 
were going, but actually seeing it 
(set to the most gorgeous cover 
of Bob Dylan’s “Forever Young”) 
gave the episode a special sense of 
finality.

If the best finales leave you with 

one final message, “Parenthood” 
offers its parting words in the last 
shot. The Bravermans, arm-in-
arm and supporting one another, 
walk off the baseball field and onto 
the green grass together. In the 
end, “Parenthood” was all about 
the power of loved ones to hold, to 
heal, to love unconditionally.

It’s not a TV show. This is family.

‘A Most Violent Year’ 
explores corruption

By JAMIE BIRCOLL

Senior Arts Editor

There’s a particular dearth 

of violence in “A Most Violent 
Year,” which is perhaps contra-
dictory to its 
title. But vio-
lence is not the 
subject of the 
film; 
rather, 

it’s the back-
drop for a story 
of 
corrup-

tion. 
There’s 

an 
inherent 

anger 
and 

frustration 
in 

the characters of this story, 
and “A Most Violent Year” is 
director J.C. Chandor’s (“All is 
Lost”) exploration of how that 
anger and frustration manifests 
itself. 
Honest 
businessmen, 

housewives, gangsters, hopeful 
employees, ultimately everyone 
turns to some form of corrup-
tion, and sometimes that cor-
ruption turns into violence.

Oscar 
Isaac 
(“The 
Two 

Faces of January”) plays Abel 
Morales, the wealthy immi-
grant owner of a heating com-
pany, which he bought from his 
wife Anna’s (Jessica Chastain, 
“Interstellar”) gangster father. 
Abel prides himself on play-
ing fairly, staying honest, never 
resorting to the shady dealings 
that the corrupt heating busi-
ness tends to use. He’s good at 
what he does, better than most 
in the business, and he looks 
to expand. But assailants con-
stantly rob his oil trucks while 
on the job, and the DA (David 
Oyelowo, “Selma”) is seeking 
to file charges against Abel, 
believing that he’s cheating the 
system. Abel wants to handle 
all of these matters honorably, 
working with the DA and the 
police, paying his debts on time, 
but the compounding weight of 
all of these issues threatens to 
undo his credo.

Really, what we have in “A 

Most Violent Year” is a perverse 
reworking of the fable of the 
American Dream. It seems hon-

esty can only get one so far. The 
New York City presented here is 
a crumbling, ruinous center of 
urban and moral decay, and if 
those ruins can be navigated by 
stepping over or on that which 
hinders you, you can achieve 
success. But Chandor makes 
clear that with one’s success 
comes another’s failure. The 
American Dream is attainable, 
sure, but only to some — the rest 
will be crushed beneath it.

“A Most Violent Year” is not 

dissimilar to “The Godfather” 
in that each portrays the undo-
ing of a good man; Oscar Isaac 
even resembles a young Al Paci-
no. Isaac’s Abel is an admirable 
character, 
vying 
desperately 

to retain those ideals that have 
carried him up the social lad-
der. It’s impossible not to hear 
the defeat in his voice when he 
says, “So this is what it’s come 
to? Walking outside like a cou-
ple of gangsters?”

But the film’s most compel-

ling character is Anna. Chastain 
proves a force to be reckoned 
with as a sort of Lady Macbeth 
— seductive, persuasive, indom-
itable, almost femme fatale. 
Her charm is only superseded 
by her bite, undoubtedly grown 
out of her gangster upbringing. 
Chastain dominates the screen, 

taking control of each conversa-
tion, her eyes piercing into the 
souls of the other characters. 
She is utterly electrifying, and 
her absence from the Acad-
emy Awards’ Best Support-
ing Actress Category is truly 
regrettable.

Despite these performances, 

the film often drags through 
heavy-handed dialogue that, 
while important and plot driv-
ing, slows much of the film’s 
uneasy energy. Chandor also 
has no problem hitting the audi-
ence over the head with meta-
phors, going so far as to include 
a scene where Abel must rely on 
his wife to kill a deer that’s been 
hit by his car. But these early 
setbacks are overcome in the 
film’s second half when Abel is 
pushed further into the muck.

Chandor has an uncanny 

ability to pick apart the human 
psyche under pressure. How do 
we respond to adversity: do we 
yield to it? Fight it? Be destroyed 
by it? And if adversity is defeat-
ed, how much of ourselves have 
we lost? The streets of New York 
City are not paved with gold, but 
its rivers run black, thick like the 
oil of Abel’s tankers. And it’s in 
flowing down those rivers that 
Abel, for better or worse, finds 
his heart of darkness.

Amos Lee stuns at 
day two of Folk Fest

By ADAM THEISEN

Senior Arts Editor

The Ark prides itself on stretch-

ing the definition of “folk music.” 
While the Ann Arbor institution is 
primarily known as a “folk” venue, 
in reality, it loves to accommodate 
all kinds of genre-breaking artists. 
In The Ark’s eyes, it seems, folk 
isn’t always just a guy standing 
alone on stage with a guitar, but 
rather a guiding set of principles 
for making art.

That philosophy couldn’t have 

been more apparent on Saturday 
night at Day 2 of the 38th Annual 
Ann Arbor Folk Festival. The 
seven-artist, five-hour show was 
like a sampler pack of everything 
The Ark has to offer year-round. 
While the show’s headliner was, in 
fact, a man by himself singing with 
an acoustic guitar, the journey to 
Amos Lee covered confessional 
singer-songwriters, 
old-school 

blues and even a true depression-
era big-band throwback.

The night began with Ann 

Arbor native Laith Al-Saadi, who 
played with what he called the 
cheapest and most-traveled gui-
tar of the night. Bearing at least a 
slight resemblance to Jerry Garcia 
with his long beard and glasses, Al-
Saadi got a great response from the 
crowd, especially when he added 
riffs from Led Zeppelin songs to 
his virtuosic guitar solos. He capti-
vated the audience, and he clearly 
had a very special relationship 
with his instrument.

Following Al-Saadi was the 

young Seattle-born Noah Gunder-
sen, who played acoustic guitar 
and sang while his sister played 
violin and provided back-up vocals. 
His songs were more elegiac, more 
delicate, with slow-building, pow-
erful vocals. After the Gundersens 
left the stage, they were replaced 
by 
the 
eight-piece 
Dustbowl 

Revival, a group that was a com-
plete throwback to depression-era 
hoedowns. Opening with a spir-
ited rendition of “John the Revela-
tor,” the horns livened the crowd 
and the five-part harmonies were 
quite impressive. The band even 
included 
a 
vaudeville-inspired 

number in its set, and it was a bit of 
a shame that everyone in the rever-
ent audience was sitting down and 
not dancing.

Between the sets, while the 

stage crew was switching out 
instruments, New England folk 
singer Cheryl Wheeler kept the 
crowd entertained. Self-depre-
cating, upbeat and off-the-cuff, 
she seemed to talk about what-
ever popped into her head, includ-
ing stories from seventh grade 
or tales about her dogs. She sang 
short songs that were goofy, like 
her song about potatoes set to the 
“Mexican Hat Dance” melody, and 
heartfelt, like her ode to her wife.

Wheeler was especially proud 

to introduce the legendary Buffy 
Saint-Marie, a singer-songwriter 
of Canadian Cree decent who has 
been around since the ’60s. The 
oft-covered 
Saint-Marie 
yelled 

her way through rock ‘n’ roll pro-
test songs with environmentalist 
lyrics, alternating those numbers 
with 
softer, 
prettier 
acoustic 

tracks, including the classics “Uni-
versal Soldier” and the Academy 
Award Best Original Song winner 
“Up Where We Belong.” Saint-
Marie was clearly a crowd favorite.

After an intermission, Holly 

Williams, granddaughter of coun-
try legend Hank Williams, took 
the stage. Dressed like a cowgirl 
with hat, boots, jeans and long 
blonde hair and singing with a 
southern twang, Williams played 
a very personal, confessional style 
of folk music. She sang about her 
grandparents in Louisiana and a 
cemetery where five generations 

of her family lay.

Then it was time for the night’s 

two headliners. Ani DiFranco 
announced, while she usually tries 
to mix up her setlists, tonight she 
would only play new songs. With 
two backing musicians (percus-
sion and bass), DiFranco played 
tracks from her most recent album 
as well as songs she had just writ-
ten. The music was mostly open 
arrangements played at slow, 
relaxing tempos, and though most 
of it was unfamiliar to the audi-
ence, DiFranco did relent and close 
her set by playing 1998’s “Swan-
dive.”

Finally, after over four hours of 

music, Amos Lee arrived. Standing 
tall with glasses and a beard, Lee 
took control of the crowd, singing 
like a folk Otis Redding with tons 
of charisma in his rough soulful 
voice. He was one of the poppiest 
musicians of the lineup, and even 
though he was performing solo 
with just his guitar, his songs felt 
fully developed. He garnered tons 
of “Whoo!”s from his fans when 
he moved all across his vocal reg-
ister. Lee told plenty of stories, 
introducing his classic “Sweet 
Pea” by telling the festival attend-
ees about a time when he made an 
elderly woman in a hospice with a 
reputation for being difficult dance 
when he played this “little ditty” 
for her. He expressed admiration 
for the city of Ann Arbor, for the 
fans who sat through a marathon 
night of music and for the other 
performers. He backed up that 
last comment when he brought out 
every other artist who had per-
formed throughout the night, all 
of them harmonizing together on 
“Angel from Montgomery.” After 
50 years of music and 38 years of a 
folk festival that still sells out both 
nights, the sense of the community 
between musicians and audience 
at The Ark feels stronger than ever.

EVENT REVIEW

Sexy ballet delights

By COSMO PAPPAS

Daily Arts Writer

Before you see their per-

formances, there are many 
things about Compagnie Marie 
Chouinard that cry out for a 
furrow-browed contemplation 
punctuated only by cultivated 
“ahs” and “hms.” An avant-
garde dance company from 
Montreal, the group bears many 
of the markers of high preten-
tiousness in the American cul-
tural imagination – abstract 
dance, 20th-century classical 
music, nudity. And did I mention 
they’re French (-speaking)?

The Statue of Liberty must 

have been the last moment of 
genuine 
cultural 
camarade-

rie between the U.S. and the 
Francophone world, since in 
response to the stereotypes 
of French-language media we 
as Americans carry with us 
– disaffected, independently 
wealthy 
faux-radical 
youth 

smoking hand-rolled cigarettes 
in a seedy bar – we typically 
give little more than an irritat-
ed sigh.

When 
Compagnie 
Marie 

Chouinard came to Ann Arbor 
on Jan. 23, they performed 
two different works. The first, 
entitled Gymnopédies, was built 
around Erik Satie’s canoni-
cal series of compositions for 
the piano of the same name. 
Beginning with the company’s 
11 dancers silently walking 

through a yonic curtain rigging 
in pairs, suggesting creation 
or birth or a reverse birth, I 
expected an uninhibited, self-
indulgent 
performance. 
But 

Compagnie Marie Chouinard is 
a lot smarter than its audience.

The next scene, a formation 

of about five to seven dancers 
donned in clown noses comes 
out bunny-hopping across the 
stage. A few audience members, 
including myself and the per-
son I went with, laughed a bit. 
“Is it supposed to be funny?,” we 
sheepishly wonder, as we try to 
suppress our laughter because 
it seems like we’re supposed to 
strain for its commentary on 
the human condition with an 
expressively unexpressive face. 
It becomes obvious that there’s 
something more at play when a 
second group, similarly garbed 
in red noses, enters stage right 
hopping in the same way toward 
the first group. And then some-
thing extraordinary happened: 
everybody laughed!

Stunt after stunt, the com-

pany brilliantly played on its 
audience’s 
expectations 
by 

foregrounding the silly and the 
goofy amid the gorgeous cho-
reography. Compagnie Marie 
Chouinard does not eschew 
expertise 
and 
technique 
in 

refusing 
ballet-as-serious-art 

and its attendant stuffiness. But 
perhaps even more importantly, 
this dance company is interested 
in sex. And yet, the depiction of 

sex is no less awkward or goofy 
than the rest of the show. This 
aspect is part of the company’s 
great success.

Compagnie 
Marie 
Choui-

nard’s thoughtful and inclusive 
sex-positivity 
consists 
iofits 

interest in the unsure, early 
erotic encounters that often 
fall outside heteronormative 
conceptions of sex. There is no 
shame or guilt or pretentious-
ness; and rather only a sense of 
goofy, playful, tender and mer-
rily raunchy unknowingness in 
their representations of sex: gay 
and lesbian and hetero.

The second half of the show, 

titled Henri Michaux: Mouve-
ments, is an engaging explo-
ration of the representational 
capacity of ballet as each danc-
er, dressed in a black body suit, 
mimics the monochromatic ink 
drawings of the Belgian poet 
and painter of the title. Once 
again, Compagnie Marie Choui-
nard averts the risk of coming 
off as uncavalierly pretentious 
with the choice of music – abra-
sive, fast-paced metal. This 
choice cements the company’s 
commitment to poking fun at 
its audience by saying, We’re 
not stuffy, so why do you watch 
it that way? Their delight is in 
subverting the typical condi-
tions of the reception of ballet 
and high culture by producing 
an intelligent and simultane-
ously very funny show.

Ann Arbor Folk 
Festival returns

Brandi Carlile 
headlines 38th 
annual show 

By AMELIA ZAK

Daily Music Editor

The first night of the 38th annu-

al Ann Arbor Folk Festival was in 
full swing this past Friday, Jan. 30. 
With a stacked lineup and the silly 
wit of the night’s MC, Steve Poltz, 
a singer-songwriter, the festival 
explored the expansive genre of 
folk music. The night began with 
the smooth, simpler sounds of ris-
ing folk bands. Billy Strings and 
Jon Dulin, a Michigan duo, had 
the audience begin its night with 
some bluegrass samples. “Walk On 
Boy” was the highlight of the duo’s 
set, giving everyone old-school 
bluegrass with a jolt of energy 
from modern day music. Mandolin 
Orange, a North Carolina-based 
group, followed these boys with a 
softer variety of folk. Performing 
simple songs made large by one 
acoustic guitar, one electric guitar 
and a mandolin, Emily Frantz and 
Andrew Marlin were another duo 
who, although currently of only 
mild acclaim, will undoubtedly 
expand their sound and popularity 
before the year’s end.

With a strong bass and bluesy 

electric guitar, the Bahamas were 
the self-declared “odd ducks” 
of the night. Throughout their 
30-minute set, the group held the 
intriguingly juxtaposed moments 
of heavy instrumental and vocal 
intensity followed by short bouts 
of calm silence. Afie Jurvanen, the 
band’s lead singer, led the show 
with his dark humor and booming 
voice through their well known 
hits like “Never Let You Go” and 

the highly acclaimed “Lost In The 
Light.” The Bahamas reiterated 
the intention behind The Ark’s 
chosen lineup: finding folk art-
ists who reform the genre’s clas-
sic sounds with individuality and 
personal taste. Here, the personal 
taste was laced with a bluesy elec-
tric guitar and ethereal vocals.

Yonder Mountain String Band 

jumpstarted its set by declaring, 
“we’re not going to say much 
after this – we’re just going to 
play.” The 30-minute set held 
no breaks, nor any perception of 
fingers. Each member’s hands, 
fingers and movements were so 
quick and so dedicated to the 
high intensity bluegrass jam 
session they began that both 
audience and artists had lost 
themselves in the art they creat-
ed. The band’s fiddler and banjo 
player added some of the set’s 
most notable solos. Following 
this fierce five-person jam ses-
sion were the fierce folk sisters 
of the Swedish band Baskery. 
Aware of the power of Hill Audi-
torium, these three sisters began 
their set with a short, eery and 
ethereal a capella number before 
drastically 
transitioning 
into 

some crowd-clapping, physical 
folk rock numbers. Songs like 
“Catslap” and “The Shadow” 
were slathered in electric banjo 
slides and harsher acoustic rock 
sounds, all with an underlying 
lyrical emphasis on feminism. 
With heads cocked and hair 
pushed to the side, these three 
sisters confidently introduced 
their sound to the older folks of 
Hill Auditorium.

The top acts of the night, criti-

cally acclaimed Alabama native 
Jason Isbell and folk-rock power-
house Brandi Carlile, refused to 
disappoint. Isbell glided on stage 

smoothly with wife and violinist 
Amanda Shires to deliver a sad and 
at times darkly humorous perfor-
mance. Songs like “Live Oak” and 
“Cover Me Up” left some audi-
ence members a bit teary-eyed as 
Isbell and his wife told the stories 
beneath their detailed storytell-
ing lyrics. The couple finished the 
set with a quietly beautiful War-
ren Zevon cover before exiting the 
stage, holding the same intense eye 
contact they held for most of the 
loving performance.

Brandi Carlile finished the 

night 
with 
alternative 
folk 

finesse filled with her powerful 
attitude and vocals. With a tat-
tered leather jacket and wide-
rimmed hat, Carlile and her band 
coolly floated on stage and ripped 
into her set. Her signature voice 
painted each song, making the 
instruments always fall second 
to the first-place performance 
she and her twinning band-
mates provided for an adoring 
crowd. Time, age and experience 
have deepened her apprecia-
tion for her career and allowed 
for more confidence in her per-
formances. She experimented 
with the crowd and venue, at one 
point using the amazing acous-
tics of Hill Auditorium to sing 
unamplified to her adoring audi-
ence. Whether amplified or not, 
Brandi’s throaty, crescendoing 
voice expanded throughout the 
auditorium in song and word as 
she told stories of inspiration and 
growth. She finished the night 
with a cover of Fleetwood Mac’s 
“The Chain.” As she twirled and 
danced across the stage, Carl-
isle made herself worthy of any 
possible Stevie Nicks compari-
son as “we must never break the 
chainnn ….” echoed throughout 
the adoring Hill Auditorium.

Michigan State outlasts 

Michigan with 10-0 

overtime spurt at Breslin

By LEV FACHER

Managing Editor

EAST LANSING — Last year, it was 

Derrick Walton Jr., then a freshman, who 
rose to the occasion for the Michigan men’s 
basketball team at Breslin Center, leading 
the Wolverines to an 80-75 victory on 
January 25, 2014. This year, with Walton 
on crutches and confined to the bench, it 
was another freshman guard who took the 
reigns in an attempt to will Michigan to 
victory: Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman.

But 
Abdur-Rahkman’s 
career 
day 

wasn’t enough to get the job done for the 
injury-plagued Wolverines, who dropped 
a 76-66 decision in overtime, falling to 6-4 
in the Big Ten and 13-9 overall.

Making just his third career start, 

Abdur-Rahkman scored 18 points on 8-for-
13 shooting from the field, easily eclipsing 
his previous career high of nine.

“I think you’re seeing that great growth 

from Muhammad right now,” Beilein said.

Beilein added that he “saw a little bit 

in video when we recruited him,” though 
Abdur-Rahkman was added to Michigan’s 
recruiting class too late for the coaching 
staff to witness his in-game abilities in 
person.

“I think we’re starting to see it,” Beilein 

said. “You saw it in the month of January, 
now let’s hope it continues in the month of 
February.”

Junior guard Spike Albrecht also scored 

18 points, while sophomore forward 
Zak Irvin added 11 on 5-for-14 shooting, 
converting only one of his six attempts 
from 3-point range.

But while Michigan State (5-3, 14-7) 

scored 10 points in the overtime period, 
the Wolverines couldn’t score at all. The 
final score of 76-66 belied the game’s 
back-and-forth nature, a trend that 
disappeared quickly once the first 40 
minutes were up.

The 
Wolverines 
stayed 
in 
the 

game throughout despite being easily 
outmuscled on the glass — the Spartans 

pulled down 43 
team rebounds 
to Michigan’s 29, 
including a 13-7 
disparity on the 
offensive end.

Michigan 
State 

shot 
just 
6-for-11 

from the free-throw 
line in the half, but 
their presence on the 
offensive glass allowed 
them to enter the locker 
room with a halftime lead. 
The 
Spartans 
recorded 

26 team rebounds in the 
frame, 10 of which came on 
the offensive end.

Michigan jumped out to 

an early 8-3 lead on the back 
of four points from Abdur-
Rahkman, who converted on all 
three of his first-half field-goal 
attempts. But Michigan State 
quickly muscled their way back into 
the game, thanks in large part to 14 
first-half points from junior guard 
Denzel 
Valentine. 
A 
thunderous 

finish by Branden Dawson on an alley-
oop lob from Valentine punctuated the 
comeback and gave the Spartans a 20-19 
lead.

“I was really impressed today with 

Valentine,” said Michigan coach John 
Beilein. “No matter what we threw at him 
… he sees the floor well, he rebounds well, 
he shot the ball well.”

Valentine finished with 25 points, seven 

rebounds and seven assists, including 
another lob to Dawson to tie the game at 
61 in the final minutes of the second half.

“I thought (Valentine) really stood out, 

in that he was able to just pick us apart 
with different things we did, one-on-one, 
zones, everything,” Beilein said. “So when 
you have a tall guy that can really see like 
that and can shoot, it really makes your 
team go.

“I didn’t like his game, but I’ve got to 

respect his game a ton today.”

Despite Valentine’s continued efforts, 

Michigan found momentum early in 
the second half, beginning with a well 
executed, 
back-and-forth 
fast 
break 

between Abdur-Rahkman and freshman 

guard Aubrey Dawkins.

After a Dawkins layup in Michigan’s 

ensuing offensive sequence, Irvin stole 
the ball along the right flank and found 
himself with enough open space to attempt 
a thunderous one-handed jam and give 
Michigan a 34-33 lead.

The momentum shifted back and forth 

throughout the half, with the Spartans 
eventually gaining a four-point lead in the 
game’s final minute before a heroic tip-in 
from Max Bielfeldt tied the game at 66.

Though the Wolverines forced an extra 

five minutes, they simply couldn’t muster 
any additional productivity beyond the 
two regulation periods.

“We probably panicked when we got 

down by six,” Beilein said. “We took an 
ill-advised 3. Your jump shot shouldn’t get 
blocked. You should shot fake and go to the 
basket. Those types of things changed the 

E

AST LANSING — 
Michigan State forward 
Denzel Valentine waved 

his arms to 
pump up the 
Breslin Center 
crowd, then 
he fired some 
words toward 
the Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 
team’s bench. 
Aubrey 
Dawkins rolled 
his eyes.

The freshman guard had 

been in the in-state rivalry game 
for less than a half, and he was 
already fed up.

On the road, in likely the 

loudest atmosphere of the season 
so far, Michigan didn’t flinch for 
40 minutes.

Then, with 3:59 left in overtime, 

junior guard Spike Albrecht found 
himself all alone at the top of the 
key, but his potential go-ahead 
3-pointer rimmed out. Michigan 
drew up the play perfectly, as it 
had several times before, and got 
everything but the finish.

Albrecht muttered something 

and backpedaled down the court, 
and the Wolverines never scored 
again, losing in overtime, 76-66.

Sunday morning, they trudged 

through the snowy weather, sent 
an undermanned team against 
Michigan State and withstood 
everything the crowd had to offer.

And they did everything but 

finish.

* * *

L

ate in the first half, just 
after Valentine shouted 
at the Michigan bench, 

the Spartans started to pull away 
for the first — and, really, only — 
time. Valentine knocked down 
a 3-pointer in the final minute, 
and there was the slightest sign 
of a smirk on Michigan coach 
John Beilein’s face as he hit it. 
Perhaps it was out of frustration 
or dejection, but perhaps it was 
because he had the Spartans right 
where he wanted them.

Seconds later, Valentine hit 

another, giving Michigan State 
its largest lead of regulation. But 
even then, the Michigan coach 
had confidence in his team. Even 
then, as the crowd noise notched 
up and Michigan State could 
have taken advantage, he knew 
there was a lot of basketball left. 
Even then, he knew the Spartans 
couldn’t keep up their 3-point 
shooting.

The last points of the first half 

were Albrecht hitting a pair of 
free throws as the crowd chanted 
“Just-in Bie-ber!” at him. The 
Wolverines pulled within five 
after a lackluster first half, and 
they weren’t going away.

At halftime, it seemed 

Michigan had played as well as it 
could have played. It mustered up 
some offense, and though it was 
beaten on the glass, it played well 
defensively.

But in the second half, 

somehow the Wolverines 
played even better. They started 
building a lead, to the disbelief 
of the crowd. Albrecht drove

Jay Harbaugh’s eight-part recruiting pitch

L

ast week, Jay Harbaugh, 
the Michigan football 
team’s tight ends coach, 

made 
national 
news when 
a top recruit 
posted a 
handwritten 
letter from 
Harbaugh. 
The letter 
outlined 
eight reasons 
— bolded 
below — that 
four-star tight end Chris Clark 
should commit to Michigan 
on National Signing Day on 
Wednesday.

Here at the Daily, we’re all 

about factual accuracy. With 
National Signing Day right 
around the corner, we wanted 
to make sure recruits really 
know what Michigan is all 
about. Below, the Daily breaks 
down some of Harbaugh’s 
listed reasons to come to 
Michigan.

1) We have used, know how 

to use and will use tight ends 
… a lot!

For starters, it’s good Jay 

knows how to use tight ends 
— after all, that’s the position 
he coaches. Frankly, it would 
behoove the Wolverines if 
they knew how to use all the 
positions on the football team. 
Last year, it seemed as if they 
struggled to properly utilize a 
number of players, including 
an athletic quarterback and 
an NFL-caliber wide receiver. 
Ideally, Michigan would know 
how to use all its best players, 
a lot.

2) You can wear No. 8 here! 

And 104,909-74,340 = 30,569 
more people will see it every 
week if you come to the Big 
House.

First, a note to Russell 

Bellomy, who wore No. 8 for 
the Wolverines in 2014: You 
were thrust into some of 
the most difficult situations 
imaginable. Replacing Denard 
Robinson partway through a 
night game against Nebraska 
at Memorial Stadium in 
2012? Tearing your ACL the 
following year? Making only 
one appearance as a junior 
for two quick series against 
Penn State? You never had a 
consistent chance to succeed 
here, and the letter from Jay 
unceremoniously indicated you 
were transferring. You deserve 
a stroke of good luck, wherever 
you go.

As for the attendance: 

Don’t sell yourself short, Jay. 
Michigan averaged 104,909 
people in 2014 because 
there was no marquee home 
game and because there was 
dwindling fan support for 
the last administration. The 
Big House will be full next 
year — there are home games 
against Michigan State, Notre 
Dame and Ohio State, and 
there is genuine excitement 
surrounding the future of the 
program. Plus, student tickets 
cost a more reasonable amount 
next year.

3) We are close to 

Chicago/Indianapolis/
Cleveland/Detroit/Madison/

Milwaukee/Green Bay/
Buffalo

Seriously, Cleveland?
Ann Arbor is decidedly not 

close to Piscataway or College 
Park, which is unfortunate, 
because those are locations of 
conference opponents.

4) We will have a QB… a 

good one!

See item No. 1. Michigan had 

a good quarterback in Devin 
Gardner, but there are only 
so many hits and protection 
breakdowns and coaching 
changes you can take before all 
that talent becomes what we 
saw last year out of him.

Will it be Shane Morris, 

Wilton Speight, Zach Gentry 
or Alex Malzone? My guess is 
Morris. And my other guess is 
he’ll be much improved from 
what we saw last year.

5) This is the best public 

school in America.

Cal would like a word. So 

would UCLA (the other school 
Clark is rumored to be strongly 
considering) and Virginia.

Look, Michigan is a great 

school, and there are tools here 
to succeed academically as well 
as athletically. One hundred 
percent of Brady Hoke’s seniors 
graduated, and that’s a standard 
that should continue.

As hockey coach Red 

Berenson recently told the 
Daily, “If you’re not interested 
in school, don’t come to 
Michigan.”

If you are prepared to play 

school, you’re in the right place.

6) We have the most wins 

… ever.

It helps that Michigan has 

been playing football since 
1879. It also helps that the 
Wolverines went 165-29-1 under 
Fielding Yost in the early 1900s. 
His teams were so good that 
he won the inaugural Rose 
Bowl, 49-0. That game was so 
lopsided that Stanford asked 
the Wolverines to call it quits 
with eight minutes left.

Wins don’t come that easily 

anymore, not for anybody.

But 915 victories is a lot. It’s 

why Michigan fans can sing 
“The Victors” — about their 
team — before the game has 
even been played. Notre Dame 
leads in winning percentage, 
though, so there’s catching up 
to do there.

7) We have the biggest 

Adidas contract in the nation.

And you’ll get all that gear 

washed for free in the best 
laundry facilities in the world: 
A brand-new, $6-million 
laundry center near the field-
hockey facilities!

8) This is a very special 

time at a very special place. 
That’s how legacies are 
cemented. We are both going 
to be a part of that! I promise 
you we will win and grow 
together.

No argument there.

momentum.”

FOOTBALL 
SPARTANS: 

During the second media timeout 
of 
the 
game, 
the 
Spartans 

trotted out football coach Mark 
Dantonio, as well as several star 
football players, to showcase 
their Cotton Bowl trophy. Eager 
to exploit the rivalry, MSU’s 
students 
immediately 
began 

chanting 
“five 
and 
seven,” 

reminding Michigan fans of 
their school’s 5-7 football record 
in 2014.

INJURY UPDATE: Walton 

was sidelined for the second 
consecutive game with a left 
foot injury. His status has 
seemingly 
worsened 
since 

Beilein first referred to the 
injury as a sprained right toe — 
he wore a boot and used a set of 
crutches as he watched warm-
ups from the sidelines at Breslin 
Center.

Following the game, Beilein 

said that Walton’s return “won’t 
be in the foreseeable future.”

and kicked to freshman guard 
Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman 
for a 3-pointer. He pointed three 
fingers toward the stands, and the 
Michigan State fans went silent.

This time the crowd implored 

the Spartans to buckle down. 
They were going toe-to-toe with 
players like Abdur-Rahkman 
and Sean Lonergan and Andrew 
Dakich. Abdur-Rahkman drove 
past Dawson to the hoop. Dakich 
pump-faked past Valentine. 
Lonergan came in for energy on 
defense.

Michigan was clearly 

outmatched physically against a 
team known for playing tough. But 
the Wolverines out-toughed them, 
beating them at their own game 
for the better part of 40 minutes.

As the second half wore on, 

Michigan State could have pulled 
away at any minute.

With 5:06 left, Dawkins 

grabbed an offensive rebound, 
scored the basket and drew a foul. 
That got another roar from Irvin. 
The Spartans, meanwhile, huddled 
up and regrouped in front of 
14,000 people who thought it’d be 
the other way around.

Valentine threw his second 

alley-oop to Dawson with three 
minutes to play, and seconds 
later Beilein winced and called a 
timeout. Maybe Michigan State 
thought this was finally the 
moment it would pull away.

Dawson grabbed the rebound 

on the next possession and 
handed it to Trice to walk it up 

the court.

“Let’s go, baby,” Dawson said, 

perhaps smelling blood. Why 
shouldn’t he? The Wolverines had 
already hung around longer than 
they were supposed to. Eventually, 
they had to fade, right?

Trice hit a jumper in the lane, 

then grabbed a steal and drew a 
foul. The students chanted “Stand 
up!” to the rest of the building, 
and the rest of the building 
obliged. Now everyone was into it.

When play resumed, Michigan 

State’s Bryn Forbes drained a 
dagger 3 to make it a five-point 
game with 1:20 to play.

Ballgame, right?
That’s what the Spartans 

thought too.

Instead, Albrecht fought back 

with a 3-pointer of his own with 
40.9 seconds to go. Valentine 
missed the front end of a 1-and-1, 
and Bielfeldt got to the rim on 
the next possession for a tip-in 
with 19.8 seconds left. In just over 
a minute, the Wolverines had 
erased the deficit.

Trice had one more chance 

to rip Michigan’s heart out, but 
his last-gasp 3-pointer rimmed 
out. The game was headed to 
overtime.

Beilein smiled.

* * *

B

ack to Albrecht. The 
junior — thrust into not 
just a bigger leadership 

role with co-captain LeVert out, 
but also a star role as the team’s 
second-leading active scorer — 
had led his team into battle and 
done everything he needed to. He 

had banged bodies with bigger 
players, hit tough jumpers into 
the defense and distributed the 
ball around to the offense.

“I saw the old Spike Albrecht 

out there today,” Beilein said.

Now he was all alone on the 

perimeter, getting the ball at the 
end of a beautifully developed play.

His miss was his first clear 

mistake, and the Spartans went 
on an 8-0 run to close overtime 
as the smile drifted away from 
Beilein’s face. Albrecht winced 
when asked about it later.

“That was a crucial play,” 

Albrecht said. “I don’t know what 
it was, but (in) overtime, we didn’t 
seem to have the same juice we 
had the whole second half.”

With 15 seconds left — 44 

minutes and 45 seconds after his 
team took the floor and made 
it a dogfight, against all odds — 
Beilein finally called off the dogs. 
Michigan State dribbled out the 
clock, and the Breslin Center let 
out a collective sigh of relief.

The deck was stacked against 

the Wolverines on Sunday, and 
yet they still managed to do 
everything short of winning. The 
deck has been stacked against 
them for weeks as the injuries 
have piled up, yet they have still 
managed to do everything they 
can — everything but finish.

After Sunday, it’s clear they’ll 

continue to do everything they 
can.

Next time, they’ll just have to 

finish.

Second half dooms ‘M’

By JACOB GASE

Daily Sports Writer

All of the Michigan women’s 

basketball 
team’s 
Big 
Ten 

road contests this season have 
followed the same script: a first-
half scoring drought followed by 
a furious second-half comeback. 
In 
four 

tries, 
the 

pattern has 
produced 
only one win for the Wolverines 
— a seven-point victory over 
Northwestern on Jan. 17.

In Sunday’s matchup with 

No. 15 Nebraska, the exact 
opposite 
scenario 
occurred. 

Despite starting the game on a 
20-9 run and never trailing in 
the first half, the Wolverines 
were 
overwhelmed 
by 
the 

Cornhuskers’ offense in the 
second half, dropping the game, 
75-60.

“I don’t really know (what 

happened),” 
said 
Michigan 

coach Kim Barnes Arico. “(The 
Cornhuskers) made shots, they 
got some rebounds. We had a 
tough time scoring down the 
stretch. They just played better 
down the stretch, they found 
the open person.”

The Wolverines (5-5 Big Ten, 

13-8 overall) let their early lead 
slip away with 16:04 remaining 
in the game, when Nebraska 
forward Hallie Sample forced 
a layup past senior forward 
Cyesha 
Goree 
to 
give 
the 

Cornhuskers their first lead of 
the contest, 37-35.

Still, 
Michigan 
seemed 

poised to recover and pull off 
the upset. After both teams 
traded several baskets to tie 
the score at 45, senior guard 
Shannon Smith and sophomore 
guard Siera Thompson buried 
consecutive 3-pointers to give 
the Wolverines a six-point lead 
with 10:13 to play.

But after the ensuing timeout, 

Nebraska took over the game.

The Cornhuskers (7-3, 17-4) 

scored the game’s next 11 
points as part of a 26-5 run that 
dashed Michigan’s hopes. The 
run included three consecutive 
3-pointers from guard Tear’a 
Laudermill to extend the lead 
from seven points to 16.

With 11 offensive rebounds 

and 15 second-
chance points, 
Nebraska 
simply refused 
to 
let 
the 

Wolverines 
put 
them 

away.

“(The 

Cornhuskers) 
got 
a 
lot 

of 
extra 

opportunities 
because 
of 
their 
offensive 

rebounds,” 
Barnes 
Arico 

said. “Sample did a nice job 
on the weak side of offensive 
rebounding for them, and she 
was 7-for-7 from the floor. Our 
game plan was to help off of her, 
and she really made big plays for 
them.”

The Cornhuskers’ dominant 

second half wasted a strong 
effort from a Michigan offense 
that has struggled to get going 
on the road.

Trying to inject some offense 

into her team, Barnes Arico 
inserted junior guard Madison 

Ristovski into 
the 
starting 

lineup in place 
of 
defensive-

minded 
sophomore 
guard Danielle 
Williams. 
Ristovski 
scored 
just 

five points in 
the game, but 
they all came 

in the first seven minutes and 
facilitated the fast start Barnes 
Arico was looking for.

More 
importantly, 

the 
Wolverines 
received 

contributions from two players 
who 
haven’t 
been 
major 

offensive factors lately: Smith 
and 
senior 
forward 
Nicole 

Elmblad.

In 
addition 
to 
her 
tie-

breaking triple, Smith finished 
the game with 22 points (18 
in the second half) despite 
battling foul trouble all day — 
she ultimately fouled out with 
seven seconds to play.

Elmblad, who was averaging 

6.8 points and had reached 
double digits just four times this 
season, finished the game with 
10 points, including three early 
baskets that keyed Michigan’s 
quick start.

But then the offense went 

cold in the second half, allowing 
the Cornhuskers to forge a 
comeback and run away with 
the game.

“We got a little bit stagnant 

late,” Barnes Arico said. “I didn’t 
think we moved the ball as well 
as we did at the beginning of the 
game, and we didn’t have the 
open looks.”

The 
loss 
dropped 
the 

Wolverines’ road record to 1-6, 
including an 0-4 mark against 
ranked opponents.

Slow start dooms 
‘M’ in close match

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

Six singles matches. Three 

doubles matches. One deciding 
set.

Redshirt 
freshman 
Davis 

Crocker lost his first set, 6-0, and 
he attributed the slow start to 
being caught up in the moment, 
given that 
he 
was 

forced 
to 
watch 

as the Michigan men’s tennis 
team fell behind early against 
Vanderbilt on Sunday.

Though Crocker recovered 

to 
win 
the 

second 
set 

7-6 
against 

Vanderbilt’s 
Suresh 
Eswaran, 
it 

proved not to 
be enough.

While his 

teammates attempted to urge 
Crocker on toward victory, he 
squandered the final, meet-
deciding set, 4-6, resulting in 
a 4-3 loss to Commodores. The 
defeat was the Wolverines’ third 
straight on the road this season.

The 
redshirt 
freshman 

explained 
that 
the 
entire 

match was a battle, and that 
ultimately, if he had played more 
aggressively, it may have yielded 
a different result. Despite the 
loss, Crocker was optimistic 
about Michigan’s fate moving 
forward.

“This one stings a little more 

because we fought so hard,” 
Crocker said. “I definitely think 
we can build on this match. We 
have a really tough schedule, so 
the fact that we were that close 
to beating such a good team on 
the road bodes well for our next 
couple of matches.”

Crocker’s match was one of the 

many comeback circumstances 

that the Wolverines (1-3) found 
themselves in during their 4-3 
loss to Vanderbilt.

Though Michigan started the 

meet with a pair of commanding 
doubles victories, it fell in a hole 
as the Commodores (5-2) won 
three straight singles matches.

Freshmen Alex Knight and 

Runhao Hua found themselves 
down early in their single 
matches against Kris Yee and 
Daniel Valent, and the young 
competitors could not salvage 
victories.

And after a positive start, 

winning his first set 6-4, senior 
Alex Petrone faltered in his final 

two sets, losing 
to Vanderbilt’s 
Gonzales 
Austin.

These three 

results 
left 

Michigan 
down 3-1 with 
three matches 

remaining.

Senior 
Michael 
Zhu 
and 

freshman Carter Lin fought 
valiantly 
and 
proceeded 
to 

establish a 3-3 tie.

This left the meet-deciding 

match to Crocker, and both 
teams swarmed to the final court 
in support of their respective 
athletes.

“Everybody was going nuts on 

both sides,” Crocker said. “The 
yelling was echoing throughout 
the building.”

Though 
the 
freshman 

garnered 
incredible 
support 

from his teammates, he could 
not prevail against Eswaran.

Despite 
the 
heartbreaking 

loss, Michigan coach Adam 
Steinberg focused on the positive 
aspects of the meet.

“I 
thought 
they 
fought 

amazingly well,” he said. “I 
thought we competed great. I 
was really proud of them. We’re 
getting better.”

Close not enough 
for ‘M’ in defeat

By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Writer

Track and field might as well 

be called horseshoes and hand 
grenades due to how often the 
word “almost” could be used. 
Almost counts for something 
with 
horseshoes 
and 
hand 

grenades. In track and field, 
almost means its definition — not 
quite.

Saturday, the No. 15 Michigan 

women’s track and field team lost 
its first dual meet of the season 
to No. 23 Michigan State, 81-80, 
a meet decided by one place. An 
almost-win.

“There were a lot of things 

where we lost by one place, and 
I’m not sure how we’re going to 
talk about that,” said Michigan 
coach James Henry. “There were 
some close ones that we won and 
some close ones that we lost.”

The 
meet 
took 
place 
in 

Allendale, Michigan at Grand 
Valley State University, providing 
a neutral site for a new Michigan 
and Michigan State track and 
field tradition — a dual meet 
between 
two 
historically 

successful in-state rivals. The 
crowd was divided 50/50 with 
both Michigan and Michigan 
State fans providing support, 
but neither created a home-field 
advantage. The tradition started 
in 2013 (Michigan won, 89-73), 
and regularly brings intense 
competition 
and 
excitement 

despite 
being 
toward 
the 

beginning of the season.

“There’s more emotions in 

this 
competition 
than 
there 

is when we’re at a conference 
championship meet,” Henry said. 
“One-on-one is going straight 
up against your rivals, so that’s 
always fun.”

Fifteen 
Wolverines 
set 

personal bests in the meet, 
including freshman high jumper 
Claire Kieffer-Wright (first place 
with a height of 1.73 meters) 
and junior Danielle Pfeifer, who 
finished first in the 600-meter 
race with a time of 1:30.66.

Michigan won six races and 

earned 25 top-three finishes 
on the day. Junior Cindy Ofili 
won three titles — the 60-meter 
dash, 60-meter hurdles and 200-
meter race. Henry was pleased 
with the whole team, but didn’t 
want to leave anyone out when 
he was thinking of specific 
accomplishments.

“If you bring up two or three 

names, you miss two or three. It 
was a good team effort,” Henry 
said. “We tried to compete as a 
team and win as a team.”

Henry also said that the 

team is coming together even 
more, as now, every athlete’s 
performance counts because 
meets are scored for the rest 
of the season. Despite the 
loss, Henry believes that the 
experience was beneficial for 
the Wolverines. An almost-win 
comes with its share of lessons.

“We have compared ourselves 

with two things: with what 
Michigan State is like and we 
compared 
ourselves 
against 

ourselves so we can improve,” 
Henry said.

With 
collegiate 
personal 

bests being achieved early in the 
season, Michigan looks well on its 
way to continued and consistent 
improvement. Even with a loss 
to a lower-ranked opponent, the 
Wolverines have both veterans 
and freshmen racing well, leaving 
no reason to worry.

Henry wasn’t disappointed, 

but rather has confidence that his 
team will succeed. He believes 
that his team has the capability to 
win races with slim margins for 
error as the season goes on.

“We just have to be mentally 

tough, that’s what it comes 
down to,” Henry said. “We have 
to win the close ones. There 
were a number of close ones by 
hundredths and thousandths of 
a second.”

Almost counts for something 

instantly 
in 
horseshoes 
and 

hand grenades. In track and 
field, almost might take a while 
to count for something. But it 
immediately brings motivation 
for the next race.

WOMEN’S TRACK AND FIELD
‘M’ wins top-10 showdown

Wolverines knock 
off No. 7 Nebraska 

at Crisler

By CINDY YU

Daily Sports Writer

A matchup against the top-

ranked vault squad in the nation 
was enough motivation for the 
Michigan women’s gymnastics 
team to prove it can compete 
with the best.

In a showdown between the 

top two teams in the Big Ten, 
the fourth-ranked Wolverines 
(3-0 Big Ten, 5-0 overall) 
recorded a season-best total of 
197.300 to beat No. 7 Nebraska’s 
195.875 points at Crisler Center 
on Saturday.

For the fourth consecutive 

week, sophomore Nicole Artz, 
senior Sachi Sugiyama and 
freshman Brianna Brown filled 
the top three spots in the all-
around standings. Artz led the 
team with a career-high 39.600, 
while Sugiyama and Brown 
improved 
their 
career-best 

totals with scores of 39.500 and 
39.450, respectively.

As 
improved 
landings 

continued 
to 
escalate 
the 

Wolverines’ 
vault 
scores, 

Sugiyama and Artz delivered 
two of the best vaults of their 
careers.

Sugiyama tied her career-

best 9.950 to win the event. 
After 
nearly 
sticking 
her 

Yurchenko 1.5 landing, the 
audience repeatedly chanted 
“10,” to signify their approval of 
the routine.

“We’ve been really focusing 

on sticks, especially this week, 
because Nebraska (2-1 Big Ten, 
5-1 overall) is known for their 
really good vaults,” Sugiyama 
said. “I had no doubt in my mind 
going down (the runway) that it 
was going to be a good vault.

“I think that it was just having 

that mindset that really helped 
out, and obviously it paid off.”

Artz scored a career-high 

9.900 on vault, good enough to 
tie for second with Nebraska 
senior Jessie DeZiel.

“It literally took my breath 

away,” Artz said. “I told Dave, 
‘Dave, I don’t think I can finish 
the meet.’ I was just so excited, 
because I worked really hard on 
that event.”

Following the first rotation, 

Michigan led Nebraska, 49.300-
48.900.

On the uneven bars, Brown 

and Artz took first and second 
place with season-best scores 
of 9.900 and 9.875, respectively. 
Senior Brooke Parker made her 
first appearance in competition 
on the bars, scoring 9.800 in an 
exhibition routine.

At 
the 
halfway 
point, 

the 
Wolverines 
led 
the 

Cornhuskers, 
98.500-98.225. 

As usual, Nebraska showcased 
an impressive vault rotation, 
scoring 49.325 in the event 
and sticking five of six vault 
landings.

Ranked second in the nation 

on balance beam, Michigan 
recorded a season-best 49.275 
in the event. Junior Briley 
Casanova scored her season-

best 9.875 in the leadoff position 
with a routine highlighted by a 
back handspring to layout step-
out and straddle jump to back 
salto stuck cold. Sophomore 
Talia Chiarelli tied Casanova 
for first with her confident 
routine performed in sync with 
Iggy Azalea’s “Fancy.”

In a three-way tie for third 

with Artz and Nebraska junior 
Hollie Blanske, Sugiyama tied 
her career-best 9.850.

“I just got to really learn 

to calm myself down before 
beam,” Sugiyama said. “I’m 
really enjoying being back in the 
all-around.”

In her second exhibition 

of the night, Parker scored a 
career-best 9.750 on beam, 
unofficially 
competing 
in 

the all-around and totaling a 
respectable 39.225.

“Brooke has been such a 

worker bee in the gym and 
we’ve been working a great 
deal on her confidence,” said 
Michigan coach Bev Plocki. 
“She’s a very talented athlete, 

but we need her to transfer what 
I see in the gym to what we see 
in competition … We need her to 
be ready, because she provides 
us with a depth that’s at a very 
high level, and that’s what we 
need right now.”

On 
floor 
exercise, 
the 

Wolverines maintained their 
momentum, topping the season 
average of Alabama, the best 
team in the nation, 49.525-
49.367. The five counted scores 
toward the team total placed in 
the top five on the event, with 
each scoring a season best. 
Junior Lindsay Williams led 
off with a 9.850 performance 
followed by Brown, Parker and 
Sugiyama scoring 9.900, 9.875 
and 9.925, respectively.

In the second round of “10” 

chants, Artz actually received 
a 
10.000 
from 
one 
judge. 

Averaged with her other floor 
score, she totaled 9.975 on the 
event.

“To see a 10 flash (on 

the 
scoreboard) 
is 
just 

overwhelming,” Artz said.

Michigan drops rivalry matchup 
to Spartans at Joe Louis Arena

By ERIN LENNON

Daily Sports Editor

DETROIT 
— 
It 
started 

with Andrew Copp flipping a 
Michigan State defender into the 
Spartans’ bench.

It ended with the junior 

forward 
and several 
other 
Michigan 
players 
throwing 
fists 
at 

Spartans, having suffered their 
first defeat since Dec. 13.

The 
much-anticipated 

matchup between the Spartans 
and No. 13 Michigan at Joe Louis 
Arena — a tradition dating back to 
1991 — was typical of the rivalry, 
with the game decided in the 
third period.

And in typical rivalry fashion, 

Michigan State (4-2-2 Big Ten, 
10-11-2 overall) managed to all 
but shut down the nation’s No. 1 
offense, forcing the Wolverines 
(7-2-0, 15-8-0) into a battle of 
goaltenders in front of more than 
20,000 fans.

“It’s 
pretty 
obvious 
what 

happens,” said Michigan coach 
Red Berenson. “Everyone builds 
this game up as an offense 
against a defense, and you know 
what happens. Defense wins.

“It’s pretty clear to us that the 

puck isn’t going to go in every 
night, and we’ve got to play 
tougher if we’re going to win 
close games.”

Though sophomore goaltender 

Zach Nagelvoort stopped 25 
shots in his second straight start, 
it was Michigan State goaltender 
Jake Hildebrand who stood on 
his head, handing Michigan a 2-1 
loss.

Hildebrand even stonewalled 

Zach Hyman, denying the senior 
forward on several backhanded 
wraparound moves, snapping his 
seven-game goal-scoring streak.

Following a scoreless second 

period, Michigan State found 

twine first in the third period.

From there, the Spartans 

exposed 
the 
Wolverines’ 

transition 
defense, 
adding 

several more scoring chances. 
Meanwhile, with less than four 
minutes remaining in regulation, 
the 
penalty 
kill 
stymied 
a 

Michigan power play that has 
led the nation since Nov. 29 by 
converting 42.9 percent of its 
chances.

Plagued 
by 
neutral-zone 

turnovers through the majority 
of 
the 
second 
period, 
the 

Wolverines couldn’t manage to 
find rhythm despite an equally 
shaky Spartans’ forecheck.

Then, with 5:34 left in the 

period, Copp poked a puck 
through the legs of Hildebrand 
for what looked to be the 
go-ahead goal, but after a review 
the goal was discounted and the 
game remained tied.

After 
four 
consecutive 

penalties and two poor power-
play efforts from both sides, 
the Wolverines headed into the 
second intermission without a 
lead for the first time since Jan. 9.

Michigan 
surrendered 
its 

first goal in five periods when 
Michigan State forward Villiam 
Haag took a breakaway pass 
from Joe Cox and flipped it over 
Nagelvoort’s right shoulder just 
minutes into regulation. From 
there, the Wolverines spent most 
of the frame in their own zone, 
allowing nine shots.

“He’s a good goalie,” said 

sophomore forward JT Compher. 
“You’ve got to get guys in front 
of him, get dirty chances, get 
rebounds, and tonight we were 
shooting from the outside and 
once again trying to be too 
pretty.”

Michigan earned the equalizer 

on a late period power-play 
goal, when Larkin — who hadn’t 
played at Joe Louis Arena since 
his youth hockey days — snagged 
a puck from the air with his left 
hand, dropped it and fired top-
shelf. In doing so, the Wolverines 
extended their team goal-scoring 
streak to 15 straight periods — a 
five-game stretch dating back to 
an overtime win over Minnesota 
on Jan. 9.

The 15th overall pick in the 2014 

NHL Draft, Larkin’s appearance 
was his first at Joe Louis Arena 
as a Detroit Red Wings prospect. 
That added pressure, Berenson 
said, may have hurt the center 
man who struggled along with 
his teammates after the first 
frame.

“I thought at times he was 

really good, and at times he tried 
to be too good, trying to do too 
much,” Berenson said. “He was 
probably overly excited to play 
this game.”

Still, 
Larkin 
and 
Hyman 

continued 
to 
distinguish 

themselves as Michigan’s top 
scorers. They have now tallied 
points in eight straight games.

Several 
skirmishes 
ensued 

after the final buzzer sounded, 
but they were of little importance. 
Michigan State had avenged its 
2-1 loss to Michigan in the Great 
Lakes Invitational.

“We played more like they’re 

playing 
now 
at 
the 
GLI,” 

Berenson said. “We played with 
desperation, tonight they had the 
desperation.”

‘Pretty’ not enough 
for Michigan in loss

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Writer

Sometimes, 
being 
pretty 

simply doesn’t cut it.

For the past month, the 

Michigan hockey team had 
played pretty hockey better than 
any team in the country.

Whether it was one-time 

goals by any of four superb lines, 
wrap-around shots by Hobey 
Baker award candidate Zach 
Hyman or flawless shots from 
beyond the face-off circle, the 
Wolverines had been playing 
highlight-reel hockey, and it 
worked 
incredibly 
well. 
In 

its 
seven-game 
win 
streak, 

Michigan scored 5.43 goals per 
game and looked nearly perfect 
doing so.

But that all came to an 

abrupt end Friday night when 
Michigan State goaltender Jake 
Hildebrand stopped 29 of 30 
shots and guided the Spartans to 
a 2-1 win.

“Michigan State is always 

going to play hard against 
us,” said sophomore forward 
JT Compher. “We’re going to 
get everyone else’s best game. 
Tonight we got a little too pretty. 
We’ve got to get back to playing 
hard, playing gritty, getting 
to the dirty areas and playing 
Michigan hockey and not relying 
on our offense as we have the 
last couple of weeks.”

Noticeably absent from the 

game were pretty goals, and the 
Wolverines struggled to produce 
much else in the game.

Certainly there were pretty 

moments. Be it one of Michigan’s 
plethora of forward threading 
through 
defensemen, 
timely 

passes in front of the net or even 
clutch shots that temporarily 
snuck through the defense to 
Hildebrand, 
the 
Wolverines 

had plenty of pieces in place to 
succeed.

Putting it together against 

one of the nation’s hottest 
goalies, however, was an entirely 
different story.

“We 
had 
our 
chances, 

absolutely,” said Michigan coach 
Red Berenson. “The face-off 
play, where Alex Kile hit the 
crossbar, and that was a near 
goal. We had isolated chances 
that maybe they were going in 
last week, but they weren’t going 
in tonight.”

Berenson had preached for 

weeks that, one day, the puck 
luck was going to run out. 
Finally, it did. The game was far 
from the high-scoring games the 
team was used to, full of fights, 
scrums, turnovers and missed 
opportunities.

The defense was tough, but 

it couldn’t compensate for what 
Michigan State had prepared on 
the defensive front.

Hyman 
and 
freshman 

forward Dylan Larkin, who 
each continued their eight-game 
point streaks, connected on a 
pretty power play goal near the 
end of the firs period, but even 
the pair, who had risen to among 
the nation’s best in recent weeks, 
were contained by their own 
confidence.

“I thought at times (Larkin) 

was really good,” Berenson said. 
“And at times he tried to be too 
good, trying to do too much. A 
lot of guys did.”

The Wolverines will have 

another shot against Michigan 
State next Saturday in Chicago. 
But if one lesson is learned from 
Friday’s defeat — Michigan’s 
first since Dec. 13 — it’s that a 
good hockey team needs more 
than just a pretty offense.

“You’ve got to get guys in 

front of the goalie,” Compher 
said. “Get dirty chances, get 
rebounds, and tonight we were 
shooting from the outside and 
once again trying to be too 
pretty. That’s not going to cut 
it.”

ICE HOCKEY

Abounader shines in defeat 
for Michigan vs. Penn State

By OLIVER HENRY 

For the Daily

As Matt McCutcheon’s left 

shoulder neared the surface of 
the mat, sophomore Domenic 
Abounader further intensified 
his efforts and resolve. With the 
possibility of a pin seemingly 
imminent, the crowd at Cliff 
Keen Arena rose to its feet and 
cheered in excitement. In the 
closing moments of the second 
period, Abounader dug deep 
and pushed McCutcheon just 
a few more inches and the 
referee’s hand hit the mat. 
Abounader rose to his feet in 
exaltation as the crowd erupted 
with cheers after his match in 
the 184-pound weight class.

Such was the scene Friday 

night as the No. 14 Michigan 
wrestling team (3-3 Big Ten, 
5-4 overall) lost to No. 5 
Penn State, 19-15. Despite a 
disappointing team loss, tenth-
ranked 
Abounader 
provided 

the highlight of the night with 
a pin on the Nittany Lions’ 
McCutcheon, ranked No. 17 in 
his weight class.

“It 
was 
a 
huge 
impact, 

a huge boost and a huge 
lift. (Abounader) is a fierce 
competitor,” 
said 
Michigan 

associate 
head 
coach 
Sean 

Bormet. “He doesn’t want to 
lose individually and he does 
not want the team to lose. He’s 
one of those guys that rises up.”

And 
that 
is 
just 
what 

Abounader did. With his team 
down 16-6 and in desperate 
need of a boost, Abounader 
stepped up to the mat.

During 
the 
first 
period, 

Abounader managed to earn 

two points on a takedown to 
earn an early advantage. The 
wrestlers were even for the rest 
of the period as time expired. 
McCutcheon elected to begin 
the second period in the down 
position, which in hindsight 
was a fatal decision.

“I actually 

wasn’t 
even 

thinking about 
it,” Abounader 
said 
in 

reference 
to 

the pin. “I just 
knew that we 
were 
really 

struggling, 
and I wanted 
to get some of 
the energy going back into the 
crowd. I thought the best way 
to do that was just to wrestle 
as best I could, and I’m pretty 
good on top so I just tried to 
utilize that and get the pin for 
the team.”

As the second period began, 

Abounader was able to maintain 
his hold on McCutcheon and 
prevent him from escaping 
early. Abounader then wrestled 
him down to the mat, making a 
series of adjustments to attempt 
the pin.

“It was just straightening 

that arm out,” Abounader said. 
“If his arm starts bending, 
he’s able to (escape). He wasn’t 
very flexible. He’s very strong, 
but he wasn’t the most flexible 
(wrestler), so it was a little 
bit easier to keep that arm 
from being limber, and once I 
straightened it and scooped the 
head, it was over.”

And with just eight seconds 

left 
in 
the 
second period, 

Abounader pinned McCutcheon 
to bring the crowd to its feet.

But Abounader’s path to 

success has not been an easy 
one. Despite early setbacks, 
Abounader 
has 
posted 
five 

victories out of six opportunities 
against 
nationally 
ranked 

opponents in 
the Big Ten.

“He started 

the 
season 

a little slow 
because 
he 

had a minor 
knee surgery, 
so he was a 
little behind,” 
Bormet 
said. 

“It took him 

a while to get his conditioning 
back to where it needed to be, 
and get his confidence back 
to where it needed to be in his 
leg and his knee. Since he’s 
gotten to that point, he’s just 
been working himself over 
and over on positions, working 
his conditioning, he’s lifting 
weights with more intensity 
and he’s doing everything with 
more intensity.”

Abounader is not relishing 

this victory, though, as he 
continues to work toward the 
postseason.

“I want to keep the train 

rolling, and I know my coaches 
will continue to prepare me,” 
Abounader said. “This (victory) 
doesn’t mean a whole lot. What 
matters (most) is in March in 
the Big Ten Tournament and 
the NCAA Tournament. I need 
to peak at the end of the season 
and just keep getting better 
and better and not halt my 
progress.”

Urgency missing for ‘M’

By BRANDON CARNEY

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan men’s wrestling 

team just couldn’t find the right 
moves in time.

Redshirt sophomore Conor 

Youtsey, 
freshman 
Alec 
Pantaleo 
and 
fifth-year 
senior 
Max 

Huntley all lost matches by one 
point in the Wolverines’ 19-15 
defeat to Penn State (5-2 Big 
Ten, 9-2 overall). A win in any 
one of those matches would have 
created a six-point swing that 
could have put Michigan (3-3, 
5-4) on top.

Youtsey and Huntley came 

into Friday’s match in winning 
form, as both went undefeated 
last weekend against Wisconsin 
and Indiana. But when it came 
down to a crucial point in the 
match, Youtsey and Huntley 
couldn’t execute the moves to 
find the winning points against 
their Nittany Lion opposition.

But if there was a loss 

that stung the most for the 
Wolverines, it was Pantaleo’s 
defeat. The freshman led for 
a majority of his match and 
only had to stall through the 
final period. But in the final 10 
seconds, Pantaleo was taken 
down, giving Penn State’s Zach 
Beitz the two points he needed 
for an upset victory.

While 
Michigan 
expected 

several 
of 
Friday’s 
matches 

to be close and prepared for 
that during the week, the lack 
of execution was the match’s 
most hurtful takeaway for the 
Wolverines.

“We had some really tough 

moments, and they got tougher 
than we did,” said Michigan 
associate 
head 
coach 
Sean 

Bormet. “That’s disappointing, 
and that can’t happen if you’re 
going to win close bouts. We lost 
some positions we knew we were 
going to be in. We didn’t drive 
the nail through the board and 
finish.”

Bormet also credited the 

Nittany Lions for coming out 
more 
aggressively 
than 
the 

Wolverines did. The four-time 
defending national champions 
won their first four duals to take 
a 12-0 lead, sucking the energy 
out of the sold-out crowd at Cliff 
Keen Arena.

“The guy that stays more 

aggressive is usually going to 
win matches,” Bormet said. “We 
want offense, because offense 
wins matches in our sport. We’re 
constantly hammering our guys 
about scoring, building leads 
and attacking through the whole 
match.”

Michigan has been trying to 

implement aggressive strategies 
like Penn State’s all season, and 
sophomore Brian Murphy was 
one of the few Wolverines who 

came out assertive within his 
bout. But even then, Murphy 
thought there was more he could 
have done.

“I knew we needed to get a 

win to get us going,” Murphy 
said. “We didn’t end up pulling 
it out. For me, winning in the 
tough positions (was huge), but I 
could have extended the score of 
that match a lot (more).”

In addition to Murphy, three 

other Wolverine sophomores 
pulled out big wins that nearly 
got Michigan the points needed 
to win. Domenic Abounader 
was able to pin his opponent 
and get the Wolverines a huge 
six-point victory that cut the 
Nittany Lion lead to four. Adam 
Coon continued his domination 
over Big Ten heavyweights, 
winning his match 5-2. Redshirt 
sophomore Taylor Massa scored 
against his opponent early and 
gathered nearly two minutes of 
riding time in his 6-3 win.

Despite results that leave 

room for optimism, the coaching 
staff will reevaluate the team 
before a weekend of must-win 
duels against Nebraska and 
Purdue.

“When we got to critical 

scoring spots, we needed more 
urgency,” Bormet said. “We 
needed 
urgency 
to 
control 

the ties, we needed urgency 
to control the attacks. That’s 
what was missing, and that’s 
something we’ll be working on.”
