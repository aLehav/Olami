Researchers overcome
technical hurdle
in construction of
longer-lasting diodes
By IAN DILLINGHAM

Students often stare at their
phones in class. They may not
realize they're actually looking
at thousands or millions of tiny
red, green and blue dots called
pixels, but they most likely real-
ize - as their batteries are slowly
depleted -- that these displays
are major power drains for mod-
ern smartphones.
That is where researchers in"
the University's Department of
Electrical Engineering and Com-
puter Science come in.
New findings published this
week in Nature Communications
may allow smartphones to run
longer on less power thanks to
advancements in light-emitting
diodes - LEDs - the building
blocks of color displays on smart-
phones and the source of count-

less other formsof artificial light.
The research was conducted
in the lab of Stephen Forrest,
the Paul G. Goebel Professor of
Engineering and former vice
president of research for the Uni-
versity.
Traditional LEDs are con-
structed with a mixture of
indium, gallium, nitride and
other inorganic compounds. In
contrast, organic light-emitting
diodes - OLEDs - are carbon-
based.
In 1998, Forrest and his team
demonstrated the first phos-
phorescent OLEDs, a subset of
the OLED family that has been
shown to be about four times
more efficient. However, these
PHOLEDs suffered from a cru-
cial flaw: They degraded under
blue light. While they performed
well with red and green wave-
lengths, it turned out blue light
was of too high an energy, break-
ing covalent bonds between mol-
ecules in the diode and rendering
it useless.
Mobile phone manufacturers
are currently able to incorpo-
rate the efficient PHOLEDs to

Courses examine
sports from varying
perspectives
By JENNIFER CALFAS
ManagingNews Editor
As the University's histori-
cally successful football pro-
gram receives criticism from
media and fans alike, the "Sport
and the University" theme

semester couldn't have come at
a better time.
Following theme semesters
titled "India and the World"
and "Understanding Race and
Ethnicity," the Fall 2014 semes-
ter strives to continue a 20-year
tradition of focused studies
within the school.
After a committee was
formed several years ago to dis-
cuss the curricula offered relat-
ed to sport and physical activity,
the ideas for the Fall 2014 theme

semester came into fruition.
English Prof. Anne Curzan, one
of the theme semester's leaders
and faculty liaison to the Athlet-
ic Department, said the theme
offers a unique perspective to
tie together athletics and aca-
demics - two defining aspects
of the University's culture.
"We decided it would be
really fun to sponsor a theme
semester on sport and the Uni-
versity to highlight all these
intersections - and to see what

departments would come up
with related to the theme," Cur-
zan wrote in a statement. "And
it has been exciting to see the
range of events and topics that
have come together around this
theme."
In conjunction with the
theme semester, a series of lec-
tures, panels and film screen-
ings will take place throughout
the fall. Some students are tak-
ing courses offered within the

HOSPITAL
Health System
to expand with
new facilities

After regents'
approval last week,
UMHS will increase
operating space
By AMABEL KAROUB
DailyStaffReporter
The University of Michi-
gan Health System is making
moves to meet increasing patient
demand.
The University's Board of
Regents approved a plan last
Thursday to build four new
operating rooms in the UMHS
Department of Surgery. The
renovation will cover more than
24,00 square feet and cost about
$23 million. The expansion is due
to be completed in Spring 2016.
The new operating rooms will
encompass an area previously
taken up by neurology clinics,
which will be relocated to Uni-
versity Hospital South, adjacent
to the main hospital. In addition
to the new operating areas, the

expansion will make room for
new storage units, offices and a
staff lounge.
"This investment in adult
operating room capacity will
improve patient access and our
overall abilityto accommodate
the growing number of patients
who seek our care," said Antho-
ny Denton, acting chief execu-
tive officer of the University of
Michigan Hospitals and Health
Centers, in a press release, last
week. "The result will be abetter
experience for patients and our
care team."
Surgery Prof. Michael Mul-
holland, chairman of the
Department of Surgery, said the
renovation reflects the yearly
increase in patients at UMHS of
approximately 4 percent per year
over the last 20 years. Not includ-
ing the expansion, UMHS has 66
operating rooms.
As the number of patients
increases, so does the number
of surgery cases. In the past fis-
cal year, the number of surgi-
cal cases at UMHS rose by 3.8

"The Map Thief'
By TOM MCBRIEN
Daily StaffReporter
Stories of daring map thefts
may call to mind fantastical
Hollywood films featuring
Nicolas Cage, but a lecture

delivered Wednesday evening
by author Michael Blanding
detailed the real-life thefts
of infamous rare map thief E.
Forbes Smiley III.
Blanding recounted his
experience researching the
events that led to Smiley's
eventual arrest in 2005,
including an interview with
Smiley himself for Blanding's
book, "The Map Thief." Smi-
ley, a respected and charismat-
ic art dealer, was often given
nearly unrestricted access to

libraries' and museums' col-
lections of rare maps - access
that allowed him to steal a
total of 97 maps, together
worth about $3 million.
Blanding, an investigative
journalist, explained his own
fascination with maps.
"I think maps reach people
on a number of different lev-
els. They can be looked at as
beautiful art objects, but at
the same time they have real
historical value," he said. "You

Pest for a pet

The story goes,"If you give a mouse
a cookie, he's going to ask for aglass of
milk." In the case of LSAsenior Clara
Jones, if you give a student a mouse,
she's going to treat it like her own it.
For a while, Jones and her room-
mates had been talking about getting
a pet.
"We had been throwing around
some bigger animals that you obvi-
ously can't have in an apartment, like
a fox," she said. "But that was a joke."
Then, the unexpected happened.
One of Jones' roommates, a graduate
student studying environmental engi-

neering, recovered an orphaned wild
mouse over the weekend while on a
local trip, and was given the option to
keep it.
"She texted a picture of a tiny little
baby mouse, and said, 'Do you guys
want a mouse?' I responded in all
caps, 'YES,"' Jones said.
Jones raised mice as pets when she
was younger, but this situation was
different. The mouse wasn't store-
bought; he was recovered in a very
weak and fragile state.
The next step was to do some
research, Jones said, after which the

roommates were able to estimate that
the mouse was seven to 10 days old.
As a result, Jones and compa-
ny have had to make some special
accommodations.
"Baby mice need mom's milk,
which we obviously don't have, so we
have kitten formula that we dilute,"
Jones said. "We have to - feed him
every two hours. So we've been divid-
ingup the nights between us."
"Theyalso don't know how to poop
on their own," she added. "We have to
rub its butt until it poops, which is a
less pleasant part of having him. But

you gotta do that."
As far as housing for the little guy,
the newly named Pickles is currently
situated in a blue, 10-inch by 10-inch
plastic box.
"He just curls up within crumpled
tissues," Jones said. "He sleeps. His
eyes aren't even open yet."
The box lies on top of what was for-
merly a fish tank heater - Jones said
this kind of heat is necessary to main-
tain a suitable body temperature.

TECHNOLOGY
From Page 1A
emit red and green light on
phone displays but have used
the less-efficient fluorescent
OLED for blue to extend the
display life.
In the most recent study,
however, Forrest's lab dem-
onstrated a longer-lasting
version of the blue PHOLED,
with a tenfold increase in
lifespan compared to previ-
ous models. Yifan Zhang, a
former student in the lab,
and Jae Sang Lee, a current
Ph.D. candidate, authored the
recent publication.
Lee said he was inspired
by his desire to create some-
thing very useful and effi-
cient and -to fill a gap in
PHOLED production that the
industry has been unable to
address.
In standard OLEDs, elec-
trons are essentially passed

along the diode in a single
line. The PHOLED takes
advantage of what Forrest
called a "quantum trick,"
which allows four times more
electrons to be transferred
between molecules.
"What makes them so effi-
cient is that what sits in the
middle of each molecule is a
heavy metal atom - iridium
or platinum," Forrest said.
"That's what made the OLED
display industry possible in
many respects, because they
needed high efficiency."
However, because these
transfers excite the molecule
into a state of high energy,
they can result in collisions
that can cause a single mol-
ecule to become twice as
excited. This unstable state,
which is determined by the
energy of the electrons, has
traditionally led to a break-
down of the diode in the case
of blue light.
Forrest's group over-

came these constraints
by increasing the area
that the electrons had to
spread out over the emis-
sive layer of the diode,
thereby lowering the
probability of such colli-'
sions.
Implementation of the
blue PHOLED into con-
sumer electronics such
as smartphones, tablets
and televisions, could
take three to five years,
according to researchers.
Once implemented, the
new diodes could reduce
energy consumption, in
these devices.
Forrest said the new
PHOLEDs could easily be
incorporated into current
manufacturingtechniques, as
their structure is very similar
to that of their predecessors.
"The equipment, the pro-
cess, the time is basically
identical in what is used
today in mass-producing

THEME
From Page 1A
theme semester, including sever-
al taught by lecturer John Bacon,
a prominent sports journalist
and New York Times bestselling
author.
"There are few places that
are suited to study ways to think
about sports," Bacon said. "That's
what's great about the University:
it's a wonderful place for ideas."
Physics Prof. Dave Gerdes, co-
organizer of the theme semester

along with Curzan, said cours-
es spanning several different
departments show the breadth of
perspectives from which sports
can be analyzed - ranging from
themes within psychology, wom-
en's studies, economics and medi-
cine. A marathon runner himself,
Gerdes emphasized the relevance
of mixing academics with athlet-
ics.
"Sports and academics are two
things Michigan does very, very
well," Gerdes said. "It can give
both students and faculty a better
appreciation for what's going on

over in the athletic campus and
realize that it's not in some ways
as much of a world apart as it may
appear."
Several events sponsored by
the theme semester have already
occurred, including a kickoff
panel featuring- prominent var-
sity coaches and LSA faculty
members, and a lecture by Bacon
during Parents Weekend.
At the kickoff, Michigan bas-
ketball coach John Beilein, one
of the panelists, gave advice to
students and student athletes
alike on how to achieve success

and face defeat. He called fail-
ure a "fertilizer for growth" and
recalled his acronym, "WIN" -
what's important now. As a well-
regarded coach whose team has
had successful March Madness
performances over the last two
years, Beilein also offered advice
on how to strive to grow in spite
of success.
Beilein serves as an example of
how the Athletic Department will
contribute to the semester.Curzan
said the department will sponsor
several events, including a lec-
ture by University alum Andrea.

Joyce, a
prominent
sports
broadcast-
er, which
will take

place Oct.
30.
Overall, Curzan anticipates
the theme semester will create a
dialogue about the intersection of
sports and academics at the Uni-
versity.
"At Michigan, you find pas-
sion for academics and passion
for athletics and we don't think

that we need to see athletics and
academics as inherently or neces-
sarily at odds with each other,"
Curzan said. "And many of us
combine sport and academics in
our personal lives in complemen-
tary, productive, fun and often
inspiring ways."

Green to be featured vs. Gophers

By GREG GARNO
Managing Sports Editor
Lost in the quarterback
competition on the Michigan
football team is the end of a
competition at another position:
runningback.
While fifth-year senior
Devin Gardner and sophomore
Shane Morris compete for
the starting gig under center,
Derrick Green is seeing the
bulk of the carries in the
backfield over De'Veon Smith.
Green, who received 14
carries compared to Smith's
four against Utah, has earned
the bulk of snaps all season
despite Michigan coach Brady
Hoke saying both sophomore
backs would split carries.
Green has received the
majority of touches - 64 to
Smith's 28 - throughout the
year. Now, Hoke has owned up
to Green's featured role in the
backfield.
"Well, I think Derrick, when
youlook at carries over the course
of the year, Derrick's averaging
6.1 yards per carry, which tells
you a little something," Hoke
said at his Wednesday press
conference. "But DeVeon's
averaging 6.9. I think we have
two very capable backs.
"Now, has Derrick been the
guywho's been featured? He's got
more snaps, so I'd say so."
Green's role is important since
Michigan has run the ball 152
times, 40 more than it has passed.
The Wolverines run enough that
nearly every passing play the
Wolverines call is out of play
action or on a type of zone read.
Green, though, has dealt
with a line that has struggled
to open holes. Against Utah, he
had to avoid running through
the tackles, and against Miami
(Ohio), he bounced outside often
instead of using his 5-foot-11,
220-pound frame to run up

Coaches prep for BiG's second year

By ERIN LENNON
Daily Sports Writer
DETROIT - When askedhow
far away his hockey program
is from becoming a revenue-
producer, Penn State coach Guy
Gadowski was abrupt.
"We are," he said.
After only one season in the
Big Ten, Penn State sold out its
allotment of
student season NOTEBOOK
tickets for its
second season in Pegula Arena
in just three minutes - with
more than 95 percent of last
year's season ticket holders
renewing subscriptions -
proving that, if nothing else,
interest is on the rise.
"The Big Ten conference
attracts great hockey players on
its own, so that's a big factor,"
Gadowski said. "We have a lot
going on at Penn State that we're
really proud of. The facility
is one, the atmosphere of the
student section is another, and
the University itself. I feel all
of those factors are helping us
improve and improve."
Outside of the inevitable
media and recruiting boosts,
the inaugural season of Big Ten
hockey proved the gap between
a fledgling program in Penn
State and the storied ones in
Michigan and Minnesota wasn't
so large after all. Teams that
want to compete for a national
championship need to play
high-caliber teams during the
conference schedule to improve,
"like osmosis," said Badgers
coach Mike Eaves. This league
is on its way - if it's not already
there - to being that kind of
test, they said.
Of course, with hindsight
at 20/20, the helms of each
program spoke of positive
takeaways from the first year in
the Big Ten, despite some of the
glaring disappointments.
"If you're as good as your
last game, well, we weren't very
good last year," said Michigan
coach Red Berenson.
Whereas it was considered
second-class in the Big Ten

FILEPHOTO/Daily
Michigan coach Red Berenson's teams have failed to reach the NCAA Tournament in consecutive seasons, but they looked poised to make a return this spring.

prior to last season, Ohio State
- which notched wins over
every conference opponent
except Michigan - could play
spoiler in March despite the
losses of forwards Ryan Dzingel
and Max McCormick. For
now, the Buckeyes remember
blowing a 4-2 lead to Wisconsin
in the Big Ten Championship,
narrowly missing an automatic
berth to the NCAA Tournament
by falling in overtime.
"Obviously, we're bitter,"
said Ohio State defenseman
Sam Jardine. "We're motivated.
Focus this summer has been
clear throughout. We're ready
to go now. And ever since that
game happened, we've wanted
to make amends."
Finally, there were those
who spoke of pure excitement
among their teams, namely the
freshmen. Michigan's eight
newcomers are poised to make
an immediate impact, while
Wisconsin will need all 11 of its
freshmen to fill key voids left
after last season. There will be

growing pains, but late-season
conference drama has primed
eagerness.
"They're like puppies in a
box," Eaves said. "They're going
to try get out of the box and you
gotta try and put them in day
after day until they figure it out."
GLORIOUS
GOALTENDING:
Perhaps more than any other
conference in the nation, the Big
Ten boasts talent in net from top
to bottom.
Last season, Minnesota
goaltender Adam Wilcox was
crowned the Big Ten Player of
the Year over stellar forwards
from his own team and over
other standout netminders
like Wisconsin's Joel Rumpel
and Michigan State's Jake
Hildebrand. Meanwhile, four
Big Ten goalies finished in the
top eight in the nation in save
percentage.
"Goaltending is just off the
charts," Eaves said. "They're
big, they're athletic, they work

at their position."
All of this is to say: expect
low-scoring, tight games come
January.
There were four goaltenders
from four different teams -
Wilcox, Rumpel, Hildebrand
and Ohio State's Christian
Frey - selected to the Big Ten
preseason watchilist. That's a list
that doesn't include Michigan
sophomore Zach Nagelvoort,
who, despite a stellar freshman
campaign, is still competing
with junior Steve Racine for the
starting job.
Toughasthesegoaltendersmay
be, Berenson was quick to remind
his fellow coaches that goalies
used to playwithoutmasks.
"You want to be tough?"
Eaves said, relaying Berenson's
mantra. "Take off your mask
and then I'll know how tough
you really are."
PRESEASON POLLS:
Coaches met early
Wednesday morning to vote on
the Big Ten Preseason Coaches

Poll, peggingreigning champion
Minnesota as the team to
beat, followed by Michigan
and Wisconsin. Rounding out
the conference, Ohio State,
Michigan State and Penn State
polled in the same order they
finished last season, at four, five
and six, respectively.
Both Copp and sophomore
forward JT Compher were
unanimous selections as Big Ten
players to watch. Compher, the
2013-14FreshmanoftheYear,will
likelyflank Copp -who willcenter
Wolverines' top line - creating
a one-two punch that could earn
the duo matching honors at the
end of the season. Copp earned
All-Big Ten Honorable Mention
after finishing second on the
team in scoring with 29 points in
his sophomore campaign behind
Compher.
Minnesota contributed
five Big Ten players to watch,
including three unanimous
selections in Wilcox, sophomore
forward Sam Warning and
senior forward Kyle Rau.

moments. These drinking habits lie
in stark contrast to what I remember
from freshman year: waiting in the
omnipresent keg line for a small,
filthy cup of flat beer and chugging it
as fast as physically possible. Pulling
from a triple-distilled bottle of pure
class was a rare delicacy back then.
Oh how the times have changed.
Nov. 1, 2011, the Michigan Liquor
Control Commission rolled its
their "keg tag registration" law.
The law requires retailers to keep
records of keg purchasers, and
purchasers to affix tags to their
kegs until returned. Rep. Mark
Meadows (D-East Lansing), stated
at the time that the law "creates a
paper trail for police to hold the
buyer accountable ... identifying the
individual who's really responsible
for the problem." The intent of the
law was to curb "out-of-control
college parties and blind pigs." A
secondary objective was to staunch
the supply of alcohol to minors, and
reduce binge drinking.
The law, however, has not had
that effect. According to an owner
at Champions, it has reduced keg
purchases at some campus liquor
stores by up to 95 percent, though
it has done little to slow underage
drinkers. In the absence of kegs,
party hosts have resorted to buying
cases of beer and hard liquor. While
the Department of Public Safety
stopped keepingstatistics on Liquor
Law Violations at the end of 2012,

reading list,

to kick off the,
__ __ __ _ fall season

By LAUREN BAGI
Weekend Roundup Contributor
Fall is officially here in
Michigan, so instead of moping
around over the end of summer
weather, get outside and take
in all that Ann Arbor has to
offer this fall. No matter what
you are interested in - from
squirrel-feeding to opera -
there are plenty of activities
to ring in this season of apples,
donuts, cider, football and
great weather.
Comedy
This weekend, The Second
City comedy troupe will be
in town. This improv-based
sketch comedy group serves
as a training ground for great
comedians. Just ask Tina Fey,
ChrisFarleyorStephenColbert!
This is a great opportunity for
procrastination while having
a laugh with friends. Tickets
are $20 for students, which is
a great deal to watch future

celebrities poke some fun at you
and your friends. The Second
City will perform at The Ark at
8 p.m. on Sept. 26 and 27.
WeatherFest
For all you out-of-state
students worrying about the
weather Michigan delivers,
especially the snow and polar
vortexes, visit the WeatherFest
this Sunday, Sept. 28, on the
Diag from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Meet weather and climate
enthusiasts from organizations
such as the National Weather
Service, National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration
and more to discuss climate
change. The event will feature
fun weather activities and
opportunities to network
with the nation's leading
meteorologists, climatologists
and physical scientists. For all
you interested in pursuing a
career in the natural sciences,
this is a must, and for those
of you who just want to learn

more about the climate, this is
a great way to get out and enjoy
the weather while we still can.
Cider Mill
One of the greatest qualities
of Ann Arbor in the fall is the
abundance of cider and donuts
available to be consumed at all
times. Check out the Dexter
Cider Mill or the famous
Wiard's Orchards in Ypsilanti.
If you are carless, there is an
Ann Arbor bus route that goes
to the Dexter Cider Mill - all
you n'eed is your Mcard to
enjoy the delicious aromas of
fall. Once you have arrived
at the cider mill, stay awhile
and enjoy the off-campus
atmosphere for a bit of stress
relief before returning to
campus and the mountains of
work you have to do.
As always, there is plenty to
do in and around Ann Arbor,
so spread your wings and try
some new activities this fall!

If you somehow find enough
free time during the day or are
looking for a book to curl up with
before bed, here are some novels
you should read this fall. .
The Cuckoo's Calling
byJ.K. Rowling
J.K. Rowling, writing
under the pseudonym "Robert
Galbraith," moved from the
wizarding world of Harry Potter
to the world of struggling private
investigator Cormoran Strike.
After the death of supermodel
Lula Landry is ruled a suicide,
her suspicious brother hires
Strike to determine what may
have really led to her death. If
you want to read more about
Strike, Galbraith released "The
Silkworm," the second Strike
mystery, earlier this summer.
Orange is the New Black: My
Year in aWomen's Prison
by Piper Kerman
Whether you spent a solid
three days watching the second
season of "Orange is the New
Black" on Netflix this summer
or haven't seen an episode,
Piper Kerman's memoir is a fast
and interesting read. While the
television show is loosely based
on her experiences, Kerman's
book does an amazing job

of telling her real story and
reflecting on her sense of shared
humanity with the women with
whom she was locked up for a
year.
The Goldfinch
by Donna Tartt
After surviving a terrorist
bombing that killed his mother,
Theo Decker's fate is changed as
he is bounced around to different
friends and family members
throughout his childhood. As he
grows into a teenager and later
intoadulthood,the one thingthat
remains a constant guiding force
in Theo's life is his possession
of a small, 19th-century
painting masterpiece called
The Goldfinch. Tartt brings
great emotional depth to the
development of her characters
as the reader follows their lives
over the years.
Paper Towns
by John Green
If you felt strangely out of the
loop for not having read "The
Fault in Our Stars" this summer,
thisisyourchancetostayontopof
pop culture fandom and prepare
yourself for next summer's
release of the second John Green
movie adaption. His novel Paper
Towns follows Quentin Jacobsen
(known as Q) as he follows a
series of hidden clues left for him
byhis runaway friend.

Obama calls for support
at U.N. to help fight ISIS

In opening address,
Secretary-General
highlights global
refugee crisis
UNITED NATIONS (AP)
- Confronted by the growing
threat of Middle East militants,
President Barack Obama
implored world leaders at the
United Nations Wednesday
to rally behind his expanding
military campaign to stamp out
the violent Islamic State group
and its "network of death."
"There can be no reasoning,
no negotiation, with this brand
of evil," Obama told the General
Assembly. In a striking shift
for a president who has been
reluctant to take military action
in the past, Obama declared
that force is the only language
the militants understand.
He warned those who have
*joined their cause to "leave the
battlefield while they can."
The widening war against
the Islamic State was just
one in a cascade of crises that
confronted the presidents,
prime ministers and monarchs
" at the annual meeting of the
U.N. General Assembly. Also
vying for attention was Russia's
continued provocations in
Ukraine, a deadly Ebola
outbreak in West Africa, and
the plight of civilians caught in
conflicts around the world.
"Not since the end of the
Second World War have
there been so many refugees,
displaced people and asylum
seekers," U.N. Secretary-
General Ban Ki-moon said as he
opened Wednesday's session.
In a rare move, Obama
also chaired a meeting of
the U.N. Security Council
where members unanimously
adopted a resolution requiring
all countries to prevent the
recruitment and transport
of would-be foreign fighters
preparing to join terrorist
organizations such as the
Islamic State group.
The American-led military
campaign in the Middle East
was at the center of much of
the day's discussions. After
weeks of airstrikes in Iraq, U.S.

planes began hitting targets in
Syria this week, joined by an
unexpected coalition of five
Arab nations: Bahrain, Saudi
Arabia, Jordan, Qatar and the
United Arab Emirates.
There were more U.S. and
coalition airstrikes Wednesday
on both sides of the Syrian-Iraqi
border. U.S. and allied planes
and drones hit a dozen targets in
Syria that included small-scale
oil refineries that have been
providing millions of dollars
to the Islamic State, the U.S.
Central Command said. Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates took part in addition
to U.S. aircraft.
France has also taken part in
strikes in Iraq, and British Prime
Minister David Cameron's office
announced that Parliament
was being recalled to London
to debate whether to join the
campaign, too.
The Islamic State has made
lightning gains in Iraq this
year and now moves freely
across the increasingly blurred
border with Syria. The group
has claimed responsibility for
the beheading of two American
journalists and a British aid
worker, sparking outrage in the
West and contributing to an
increase in public support for
military action.
Shortly after Obama's
remarks, France confirmed that
Algerian extremists allied with
the Islamic State group had
beheaded one of its citizens after
the French ignored demands to
stop airstrikes in Iraq. French
President Francois Hollande,
who was in New York for the
U.N. meetings, said the killing
underscored why "the fight the
international community needs
to wage versus terrorism knows
no borders."
U.S. officials say they are
concerned that foreigners with
Western passports could return
to their home countries to
carry out attacks. And even as
Obama welcomed support for
the resolution to deter foreign
fighters, he said more must be
done.
"The words spoken here
today must be matched and
translated into action," he said.
The threat from the Islamic
State group has already drawn

Obama back into conflicts in
the Middle East that he has long
sought to avoid, particularly
in Syria, which is mired in a
bloody three-year civil war.
Just months ago, the president
appeared tobe on track to fulfill
his pledge to end the U.S.-led
wars he inherited in Iraq and
Afghanistan.
Obama sought to distinguish
this current military campaign
from those lengthy wars,
declaring that he has no
intention of sending U.S. troops
to occupy foreign lands. He
also pressed Middle Eastern
nations to look beyond military
action and take steps to reject
the ideology that has spawned
groups like the Islamic State
and to cut off funding that has
allowed that terror group and
others to thrive.
"No external power can
bring about a transformation
of hearts and minds," Obama
said in his nearly 40-minute
address.
Apart from the Middle East,
the president was particularly
blunt in his condemnation of
Russia's actions in Ukraine. He
accused Moscow of sending
arms to pro-Russian separatists,
refusing to allow access to the
site of a downed civilian airliner
and then moving its own troops
across the border with Ukraine.
Still, Obama held open the
prospect of a resolution to the
conflict. While he has previously
expressed skepticism about a
cease-fire signed this month,
he said Wednesday that the
agreement "offers an opening"
for peace.
If Russia follows through,
Obama said, the U.S. will lift
economic sanctions that have
damaged Russia's economy but
so far failed to shift President
Vladimir Putin's approach.
The chaotic global landscape
Obama described Wednesday
stood in contrast to his remarks
at the U.N. one year ago, when
he touted diplomatic openings
on multiple fronts. At the time,
the U.S. was embarking on a
fresh attempt to forge an elusive
peace between Israelis and
Palestinians and there were
signs of a thaw in the decades-
old tensions between the U.S.
and Iran.

U The Michigan Daily I michigandaily.com I Thursday, September 25, 2014

The world of contemporary art
has historically been dominated by a
small sliver of individuals: art cura-
tors, writers, and aficionados. The
conversation about this fast grow-
ing field is expanding, catalyzed by
events that allow contemporary art
to be more accessible to the general
population. In Michigan, the Grand
Rapids ArtPrize, a radical, in-your-
face international art competition
with the goal of promoting discourse
over contemporary art, has pushed
boundaries to bring the medium into
its rightful place in the sun.
ArtPrize was founded in 2009
by Grand Rapids native Rick DeVos
III, son of 2006 gubernatorial can-
didate Dick DeVos II, and. a small
group that wanted to find a way to
bring contemporary art to a histori-
cally conservative city. The concept
was masterfully simple: encour-
age contemporary artists to make
agreements with downtown venues,
which could range from an actual
museum to a small family-owned
shop, and create a work of art to
compete for a grand prize. The only
qualifications are that the artists
must be over 18 years old and that
the venues are within the dictated
ArtPrize district. Otherwise, anyone
can participate.
Exhibitions Director Kevin Buist
has been with the organization since

the beginning. Since ArtPrize is
independently organized between
the artists and the venues, who con-
nect on ArtPrize's website, Buist's
role is to provide support for the col-
laborative process as well as orga-
nize speakers and the judges for the
event. Since Buist has been with the
organization since 2009, he's seen
how ArtPrize has grown in the last
five years.
"It was really disruptive. People
loved it, people hated it, people
didn't know what to think about it,"
Buist said about the 2009 event. "It
was very radical because the criteria
was very open, anybody could be an
artist and any place in downtown
Grand Rapids could be a venue."
Buist noted that there remains
a very stark distinction between
contemporary art and other artistic
media, which is what ArtPrize aims
to change.
"(ArtPrize) operated as a foil to
how things typically work in the
contemporary art world," Buist said.
"Even very cultured people don't
really know what's going on in that
weird little world, which I think is a
problem. We really wanted to cross
those wires, to open up that conver-
sation again and get this exchange
happening across those various divi-
sionsthat have formed naturally over
the years, and the public vote opened

that and opened alot of debate."
The artists who participate inArt-
Prize have come from nearly every
state and more than 30 countries in
the past. In 2013, there were 1,524
art entries, which ultimately boiled
down to participation at 169 venues.
400,000 visitors came to ArtPrize
last year from across the state and
the world.
Originally, ArtPrize awards were
solely based on public vote. In 2010,
Juried Awards were implemented
alongside the Public Vote Awards,
adding an interesting distinction
between what the public voted for
and what art experts liked. New
for 2014 is a restructured prize sys-
tem with five awards for both the
Public and Juried Prizes: Two-
dimensional, Three-dimensional,
Time-based, and Installation prizes,
each for $20,000, and two $200,000
grand prizes. Placing the public vote
against the jury vote has become a
central component of the event, add-
ing an intentional tension between
the two.
Todd Herring is Director of Mar-
keting and Communications at Art-
Prize, and oversees the planning and
execution of the event's awards and
manages critical discourse events,
print materials and the general art
design for promotional materials.
He joined the ArtPrize team in 2011

after attending the event in 2009 and
volunteering in 2010.
"What's changed with ArtPrize is
the nature in how people engage the
event and explore it," Herring said.
"The idea of this conversation about
art and why it matters is something
that is always relevant and always
surprisingly accessible. It's changed,
for a lot of people, how they view
contemporary art."
Through the event's focus on
community-based interaction, Todd
noted the ease with which commu-
nity members can become involved,
whether through voting, providing
a venue for an exhibition, or simply
attending and enjoying the art.
"Play that out over six years and
what you have is 400,000 visitors
who are ready for that experience
and are looking forward to the abil-
ity to participate in the conversa-
tion," Herring said. "They're more
willing to yield to the artists and
what they're trying to accomplish
through their work. What ends up
happening is a strange, beautiful
meeting that was called to order by
a basic inspiration to be creative and
collaborate."
Historically, Grand Rapids and
west Michigan have been a bastion
of political and social conservatism
which, on its face, might be expected
to clash with ArtPrize's support for

radical, disruptive art. Both Herring
and Buist noted that while the politi-
cal orientation of everyone involved
in ArtPrize is incredibly varied,
everyone is willing to invest in
things that will change and impact
the Grand Rapids community. This
diversity allows for administrative
decision-making to go through many
opinions and find the best solution
to please everyone. In terms of the
art that is featured and the reac-
tions visitors have to it, that at least
is beyond the control of the ArtPrize
staff and completely relies on the
individual artists, which is part of
the exciting beauty of the event.
"(ArtPrize) can be quite explo-
sive at times, and it's a really excit-
ing thing to watch," Herring said.
"It's the artist's job to tell us what's
wrong with the world and what's
changed in the world, and they do
that very much here. There have
been very controversial projects
that support and bring to life every
possible political view that you can
imagine."
"What you end up getting is hav-
ing the understanding that artists
have a lot to say and they do so in
a way that's different than what the
news media does, and is different
than what you see in anywhere else
in the world."

Where's the beef? NETFux
Television bi
without the guilt

Shows with cheap
cliffhangers are best
for marathoning
By CHLOE GILKE
Daily TV/New Media Editor
My name is Chloe, and I'm a
binge watcher.
I say this with no shame or
regret. Where others might brag
about their two-minute mile or
impressive collection of Beanie
Babies, I speak -with the same
pride about mytelevision viewing
habits. I watched the entirety of
"Lost" (yes, 121 episodes) in the
course of a single lazy June. I
caught up with "Breaking Bad"
in the two weeks before the
fourth season's premiere. One
of my friends (no doubt worried
about my mental health) tries to
justify my habit, saying: "You're
a film major. For you, it's like
studying." But there's no need for
explanation. It's not all work, and
I can only write about a fraction
otthe endless stream of television
I watch. Sometimes, it's just
fun to watch an entire season of
"Justified" in one sitting.
The luxury of being able to
binge on TV is a relatively recent
development. Even ten years ago,
catchingup on TV meant parking
yourself in front of the TV for 6
p.m. reruns or spending $70 on
DVD boxsets. The term du jour
was "marathon," and I actually
prefer this one, since it makes TV
viewing seem like an impressive
hobby. Sure, it's a hobby that
involves staring at a little screen
andlittle tono physical movement,
but just like a running marathon,
a television marathon is a test of
endurance and willpower. The
first few miles are pretty easy, but
as I approach the finish line, it's
increasingly difficult to maintain
the momentum I took for granted
at the beginning. (This is as good
a time as any to mention that I
am not an actual runner.) The
semiotics of the word "binge"
point toward negativity and guilt.
Like eating three chocolate cakes,

binging a season of television
is by definition excessive, not
impressive. Binge is the word of
group meetings, circles of chairs
and downcast eyes. Despite all
the progress that TV has made
into being considered a legitimate
medium, and the university
courses and nonfiction books
dedicated to exploring its merits,
consuming television in large
quantitiesis still stigmatized.
But there's no shame in
enjoying television however you
please - Netflix built its entire
business model on subscribers'
love of viewing episodes one after
another. With its first hit original
drama, "House of Cards," Netflix
took an enormous gamble in
putting all thirteen of its episodes
online at .once. Theoretically,
viewers could spend a single day
marathoning the episodes, and
then forget all about them: For
"House of Cards," this wasn't the
case. The hype was practically
inescapable, and a series that
might have been mediocre fare on
an established network like HBO
catapulted Netflix (and "House of
Cards") to prestige cable status.
The spoiler grace period was
extended beyond that of a network
series. (I didn't watch "House of
Cards" until a few months ago,
but miraculously, nobody spoiled
me about That One Thing That
Happened). Netflix smartly called
the episodes "chapters" - just like
a book, it's up to the viewers when
and how to watch episodes. With
other Netflixreleaseslike "Orange -
is the New Black" and "Arrested
Development," the same viewing.
flexibility is offered. If you're a.
trained marathon viewer like me,
you can let episodes play one after
another. If not, they'll always be
waiting.
Binge culture has also helped
some network series garner a
larger live audience. "Breaking
Bad" had a niche audience in
its earlier seasons, but Netflix
marathon viewing helped its
ratings climb to unprecedented
highs for its final episodes. Even
eleven months after its series
finale, "Breaking Bad" is still the

second most watched series for
U.S. subscribers. For series that
have a slow build, the marathon
strategy can be crucial for
building a fanbase. "Scandal"
initially struggled to find an
audience on ABC, but a Netflix
release made it easy for viewers to
catch up for season two's fantastic
Defiance arc. While it was on the
bubble of cancellation after itsfirst
season, "Scandal" is now headed
into its fourth year with some of
the highest ratings on television. I
countmyselfasoneofthe"Scandal"
converts. I underestimated .the
show after its lackluster pilot,
but all it took to correct that
misjudgment was a few days of
marathoning. The phenomenon
isn't just limited to good shows.
It can't be a coincidence that
series like "The Walking Dead"-
see massive ratings growth
with each season, while similar
shows that are less easy to find
on streaming platforms (like BBC
America's "In the Flesh") have
smaller audiences. Simply, binging
translates to continued viewing.
Many critics claim that
marathon viewing is an insult to
the television medium. Instead
of fully immersing yourself in the
narrative, some say that it's better
to parse out episodes one by one,
letting their subtleties sink in
whileyoucarryaboutyournormal
life. The traditional method is
okay,too.Sometimes marathoning
isn't feasible, and with shows
like "Mad Men," the slow pacing
pairs nicely with slow viewing.
But with series like "The Walking
Dead," where cliffhangers are
cheap and zombie thrills are
best enjoyed while finishing calc
problem sets, it's pretty ridiculous
to adhere to such a code for
viewing. Not all television is art
worth deliberating, and there is
no ideal way to watch television.
Watching at whatever pace feels
right, letting the episodes take as
much (or as little) breathing room
as they require, is the way to go.
After all, marathoning TV isn't an
assignment (well, maybe it is for
me). There's no shame in running
a fast race.

toms that

'90s. My hometown is an hour
away from A2 and I figured
I'd make it back there in
time before Michigan turned
uncomfortably cold. What I
forgot was that this state is
almost always uncomfort-

disregard for the contents

writhe into a pair of cut offs

ARTPRIZE
From Page 1B
Rick * Beerhorst is a Grand
Rapids-based artist who has
participated in ArtPrize since
its first year. Beerhorst was born
and raised in Grand Rapids and
attended Calvin College until his
itch to create art inspired him
to drop out and move to New
York City. After living there for
a few years, Rick moved back
to west Michigan to finish his
undergraduate degree and attend
graduate school. In the process,
he met his wife of 26 years and
had six children. In 2005, he and
his family sold two-thirds of their
belongings and their house and
moved to New York. Ultimately
though, Grand Rapids was home,
and they made the move back a
year later.
Beerhorst is known for his
folk art-influenced painting
style, typically portraits of young
wome n, which is a style he's
worked with for about 30 years.
In 2010, his installation "Plan B"
won the Best Use of Urban Space
award at ArtPrize, and outside of
Grand Rapids he's had paintings
featured in exhibitions all over the
continental United States.
"A lot of times, the art world
is frustratingly a very small
conversation," Beerhorst said.
"With ArtPrize, suddenly all
these people from all over the
place are coming downtown to
look at art. It's making a much
larger conversation that what
would normally happen in this
little ecosystem of art museums
and galleries and alternative

spaces.",
Beerhorst's 2014 ArtPrize
installation is, at the core, a
painting that measures 12 feet
long and eight feet tall, that is a
double portrait of two women in
front of a view of the city of Grand
Rapids. Along with it is a Plexiglas
display case filled with items that
helped create the painting, like
photographic references, painting
tools and drawings.
Part of the installation will be
a documentary film of how the
work was made, edited down
to a five minute loop. Visitors
will be able to interact with the
installation by filling out one of
many postcards provided, where
individuals are encouraged to
write their address and a hope
they have for their respective
hometowns. After three weeks,
Beerhorst and his crew will mail
the cards back to the writers
around the world. Beerhorst has
been working on this project
since the middle of January, with
his team of a dozen others. The
project required $20,000 worth
of funding, made possible by
donations fromlocal companies.
Beerhorst is confident that
ArtPrize has initiated a change
in the contemporary art world for
the better, and is eager to see the
effects events like these will have
in years to come.
"One of the reasons Egypt
developed such a rich and
incredible cultural legacy was
because the Nile River flooded
every year. When it flooded, it
pushed all this really fertile soil
onto the banks, andthe Egyptians
were abletogrowincredible food,
and with the food came society
and culture," Beerhorst said. "If

you think of that metaphorically,
a city like Grand Rapids, which in
some ways is just one more small
Midwestern town, is affected
by this cultural overflow that
happens here year after year.
Eventually, the cultural soil
gets deeper and deeper, so more
things can take root here."
In terms of whether or not the
popularity of ArtPrize will over
commercialize the event, Herring
denies the possibility, noting the
unique independent structure.
"Everything has the potential
to become too commercialized.
The one thing that ArtPrize is
really rooted in is the fact that
we're independently organized
as an event, the organizers
don't play any role in deciding
what art gets into the event
or where it goes, it's up to the
artists and the venues to form
their own decisions," Herring
said. "Because of this model, the
platforminwhichwe deployeach
year, we as an organization can't
control what kind of art shows
up, where it shows up, and how it
plays out. We don't even have the
opportunity to insist upon that
(commerciality), and that's the
beauty of the event."
It's this unique combination
of independent organization
and public involvement that
the ArtPrize team hopes will
inspire the creation of similar
contemporary art exhibitions
around the United States and
aroundtheworld.
. "I can see ArtPrize becoming
a hub for events like this around
the world," Herring said. "We've

COURTESY OF FOREVER FESTIVAL
Adventure Club was among the many acts performing at Freedom Hill Amphitheater in Sterling Heights last weekend.
Bass-blasting sets
at Foreve r- Festival

Flux Pavillion and
more bring EDM to
Sterling Heights
ByARIANAASSAF
Daily StaffReporter
Last weekend's Forever
Festival at the Freedom
Hill Amphitheatre in
Sterling Heights was one big
adventure. As a junior from
California, it's kind of a shame
that I haven't really explored
other parts of Michigan yet.
But this isn't the first time
the tantalizing idea of a music
festival has led me to do crazy
things, and driving an hour
east of my University bubble
seelIed to be - and was -
simple and more than'worth
it. Besides, I was looking for
an excuse to take a break from
yet another (disappointing)
football Saturday.
The aura and setup of the
festival was interesting, to
say the least. There were
Lululemons sprinkled among
more traditional rave tutus,
an exasperated but meager
crowd of patrons planning a
coup to get themselves closer
to the stage, and even weird
bell pepper and mozzarella-
stuffed burgers. A bored
usher tried flirting with me
just moments before someone
else asked me point-blank
if I had any crack. Clearly a
wholesome combination.
As it turns out, aside from
the asshole security guards
and the overwhelming
consensus that the pit needed
to be opened up to allow more
people in, the festival was
curated quite well. Unlike
larger ones where you have
to trek what seems like miles
between stages only to be
rewarded with too-short
sets and too-long wait times,
Forever Festival had picked
a select few strong groups to
play for substantial periods of
* time.
By the time we arrived,
Caked Up was already living
it up on stage. Like many of
the artists I would see that
day, I was not familiar with
this duo. A little post-festival
research showed they rose in
popularity relatively quickly,
especially after their remix
of "Wrecking Ball" went
viral last October. Even in
the awkward amphitheater
setting, the duo's hold on
the audience was impossible
to ignore. Around 5:00, the
venue was still more than
half empty, and with strict-
bordering-on-combative
security guards severely
limiting the capacity of the
pit, feelings of irritation could
have easily undermined the
intended party atmosphere.
Any brave soul who attempted
to jump the flimsy dividing
fence between the first row
of seats and the pit would be
swiftly - oftentimes harshly
- escorted out. But even when
things took a turn toward
aggression (a tussle ended
in a 90-pound girl being

momentarily knocked to the
ground), the fans already in
attendance still really looked
like this was the performance
they'd been looking forward
to.
Caked Up has clearly
mastered the art of variety,
even within a sometimes
narrow genre. At times, its
music is slowed down and
sexy, at others its rapid-fire
urgency demands a whole new
kind of attention. Oscar Wylde
and Vegas Banger danced
behind their turntables with
just as much animation as
the fans, enjoying themselves
as though they were in
the audience watching
their favorite DJ perform.
Remixing old favorites like
"Party Up (Up In Here),"
"Move Bitch" and even
"Heads Will Roll" really got
people to get down with their
bad selves. It was a smart
move for Wylde and Banger
in their effort to continue
drawing in new fans using
familiar tunes with a twist.
Eventually, this good-
time group gave way to
something slightly more
ominous. Destroid, made up
of Excision, Downlink and
KJ Sawka, is a live bass music
band that adds notes of metal
to its mostly EDM sounds.
Having never heard of - let
alone seen- the group before,
my first thought when they
came on stage was, "Holy
shit, they have robots!"
It's true; Destroid leaves no
detail left out when it comes
to portraying its story of
aliens taking over the world
with bass music. This is the
tale that helped define the
band's mission statement,
and it's ever-present in the
performance. Destroid's style
is a bit hard to digest, but
not necessarily in a bad way.
The songs remain energetic
while spiraling into slow,
deep rumbles that make
the experience quite unlike
anything else. I'm not all
about the monster voices and
creepy chimes warning of the
impending annihilation, but
at least it was theatrical.
Adventure Club followed,
blasting an explosive remix
of "We Dem Boyz." By now
the amphitheater was full
and, despite the somewhat
defective setup, the crowd's
energy was great and the
performers continued to
impress. Fortunately, we
snuck our way to the front of
the crowd waiting for more
room to open up in the pit
just in time to be let in, and
thus got to enjoy Adventure
Club from within the most
electrifying area of the whole
amphitheater. I generally
believe that the more crowded
a show is, the better (to an
extent). Here, there was so
much room that a boy with
a semi-obvious Napoleon
complex back-flipped every
single time the bass dropped,
yet I didn't feel like I was
swimming in empty space.
Nothing could bring down
the good vibes as Adventure

Club spun its remix of Foxes's
"Youth." I recognized "Gold"
featuring Yuna and "Crash"
from their 2013 EP, and
everyone had a blast listening
to themintersperse snippets
of Martin Garrix's anthemic
"Tremors" with the group's
own music. The camaraderie
was palpable: Adventure
Club shared with us its new,
ultra-dynamic and perfectly
spastic song "Fame," and we
all shared with each other the
sweat that comes with raging
for hours in pseudo-Indian
summer humidity. One group
even gleefully reunited
with its hip-shaking, tutu-
wearing, fairy-polar-bear
friend midway through the
set, and somehow I felt so glad
for all of them. Christian and
Leighton carefully sounded
out their last notes with a
mash up of "Summertime
Sadness" and "Crave You,"
and headliner Flux Pavilion
came on to contribute to the
end of their set and see them
off.
Flux Pavilion's cheeky
Brit personality and humor
shines through the music
as he plays. He started right
off with beats that made
the whole place vibrate and
blasted the audience with
mist/fog so thick you couldn't
see your own hands in the
air like it was his favorite
thing to do. Turns out, it was
one of our favorite things
for him to do, too. Dizzying
strobe lights somehow shined
their way through the mist.
Though we'd been going all
day (for some festival-goers,
this was their second day), no
one thought to stop dancing.
He was too good! At times
his music got so frantic you
almost didn't know which of
the twelve competing beats
to pick up on and dance to -
it was a brilliant exercise in
following along. My guess is
he was just having a little fun
fucking with us, especially
when he mentioned he didn't
realize the thunderstorm
that had been roaming across
Michigan all day "was really
you guys." We all cheered
at his compliment and
applauded the joke. According
to Flux, "You come for the
music, you stay for the puns."
At Forever Fest, in the
delightful fashion of music
festivals, I dipped my toes
into the musical streams of
different artists I probably
wouldn't have had much
regard for otherwise. Yes,
I absolutely lost my shit
when Flux put on Skrillex's
"Recess," and it was cool to
hear two different artists mess
with "Heads Will Roll" during
their sets. But watching
some guy in an astronaut-
esque suit attempting to
twerk while crowd-surfing
to Caked Up's trap-y stylings
and temporarily entering an
alien-infested universe are
just two examples of the great
experiences that made me
want to stay in those worlds.
With any luck, I'll go back one
day.

SINGLE REVIEW

"I love myself!"
Yes, you should, Kendrick.
We do too.
Ken-
drick
Lamar's
first single Kendrick Lamar
off his Aftermat/lnterscope
forthcom-
ing album hit the airwaves
earlier this week, titled "i."
It's the first new music we've
heard from the celebrated
artist since his 2012 break-
through record, goodKid,
m.A.Ad City.
The track pulls a sample
from the IsleyBrother's 1973
soul hit, "That Lady," giving
the song a funky undertone as
Lamar's raspy voice raps over
it. The new single was first
alluded to in mid-September
when Lamar released the
track's cover art, detailing two
men dressed like a Blood and

Night Live" has produced

edy world. Twins

expected
from "SNL," though, to be
fair. What's rarely expected,
however, are two recently
retired alums teaming up
for a compelling, heart
wringing drama. Kristen
Wiig ("Bridesmaids") and
Bill Hader ("Superbad") seem
to pepper real laughs within
a main dish of familial con-
flict.
The opening frame shows
an eye-level two-shot of Wiig
sitting next to a book-wield-
ing Hader. Asking his sister
if she has read "Marley &

a Crip with their hands in the
shape of hearts rather than
their respective gang symbols.
The artwork implies the song's
message of peace and unity,
and with lyrics as inspiring as
ever, Lamar speaks honestly
about the impoverished world
of his childhood. By offering
up his personal experiences
in his lyrics, Kendrick Lamar
performs a sort of activism
that can offer hopefulness to
others in the face of similar
adversity. The song's constant
remains in the uplifting cho-
rus, a repeating and sometimes
interrupted "I love myself."
Building in intensity but main-
tainingaconsistentlyfunky
jazz bass, the songis a four-
minute reminder that Kendrick
can be missed but never forgot-
ten.
Still remaining somewhat
individualized inan industry

Pussy R iot's palatable punk mission

Can these Russian
activists make
the genre popular
again?
By GIANCARLO BUONOMO
SeniorArts Editor
I'm the youngest of three chil-
dren, and therefore had the luxury
of hanging out with my siblings'
friends and learning all sorts of
deliciously mature words and hab-
its. Once, when I was 11 or 12, my
sister had some of her high school
friends over, who usually toler-
ated me and my questions about
bongs and thongs and other big-kid
stuff. There was one guy who fas-
cinated me, named Jason. He wore
black Doc Martens, a belt made of
rounds of ammunition, a white cut-
off T-shirt, and was crowned by a
mohawk with spikes like the blades
of a ceiling fan. Being young and
curious and without much deco-
rum, I poked him on the shoulder
and asked, "Are you punk?"
He turned towards me slowly,

and spoke in a tone both pained
and condescending.
"No, I'm a human being."
Thus began my history of not
understanding punk. I'm not
unusual in this - arguments over
the origins and aesthetics of the
genre occur among both academ-
ics and members of the movement.
This is made even more confus-
ing by the diverse, often contrast-
ing sub-genres of punk: hardcore,
street, pop, gutter and many more.
Each one hasits own sound, its own
style, itsown convictions.
So I was nervous, to say the least,
when I walked into the palatial
lobby of the Michigan Theater last
Thursday, where the most recog-
nizable and lauded punk practitio-
ners were making an appearance:
Pussy Riot. Two of the founding
members - Nadya Tolokonnikova
and Masha Alyokhina - would
be giving a Penny Stamps Distin-
guished Speakers lecture about,
their music and activism.
I walked out two hours later,
saying, "That wasn't that bad," as
if leaving a doctor's office after
receiving a round of vaccinations.
My relief didn't come from some

conservative dread at having to
listen to two of the most famous
feminists in the world denounce
patriarchy and homophobia. In
fact, their views, and their impris-
onment because of those views, is
what drew me to them in the first
place.
Rather, it wasaversion of impos-
ter syndrome. Who was I to take up
a seat in the audience and cheer for
these women? And furthermore,
who were any of us to go see them?
I half expected Pussy Riot to come
onstage wearing their signature
balaclavas, and then chastise us all
for taking time to see them when
we could be out protesting or vol-
unteering or fighting the power.
Instead, Pussy Riot's lecture
was... alecture. They came onstage
with warm,almost shysmiles
spoke with both wit and pas
about feminism, Russian politic
conceptual art, Heidegger, Ameri-
can prisons. They thanked all 1,700
of us for listening to them. They
laughed, often. While listening to
these two strong, beautiful women
discuss Plato's concept of techno
and Joseph Kosuth's "Art after Phi-
losophy," I almost forgot the video

screenedbefore they came on stage
- horrifying footage of them being
pepper-sprayed, whipped and oth-
erwise brutalized by the Russian
police and paramilitary Cossacks,
just for holdinga public protest.
The engaging, even fun, lecture
was a far cry from the last punk
event Iwent to. That wassahardcore
show at a friend's house, where the
audience could have fit on a school
bus and the lead singer kicked me
in the solar plexus. In fact, Pussy
Riot's global recognition - a Len-
nonOno Grant for Peace, thousands
of followers on Twitter, speaking
engagements at major American
Universities - seems decidedlyun-
punk.
Well, what is punk? As I men-
tioned before, it's a slippery term,
but there are a few defining charac-
teristics. Jesse Prinz, a professor at
CUNY, attemptsto categorize these
fundamentals in his essay "The
Aesthetics of Punk Rock." Accord-
ing to Prinz, the defining pillars
of punk are irreverence, nihilism
and amateurism. By informing the
sound, lyrics, fashion and media of
punk, these traits form the charac-
teristic anti-authoritarian zeitgeist

of the larger genre.
Butthe problemwithpunkisthat
each band's definition of "author-
ity" is different. For example, The
Dead=Kennedys wrote songs that
pilloried the Reagan Administra-
tion and the cultural conservatism
of the '80s. It's hard to ar'gue with
their choice of opponents. But for
every band like the Dead Kennedys,
there's a band whose beef is with
political correctness, like Dwarves
and their album"Thank Heaven for
Little Girls." Because punk is about
subversion, even the most open-
minded observer will inevitably
take issue with what some band
subverts.
It goes without saying that
becoming a "fan" of any band or
genre is risky. Which is why Pussy
Riotis,in manyways,theidealpunk
band. On the one hand, they're as
punk as you can get. Their slogan-
eering, technically inept music is
so DIY that they don't even record
it - they just play it in impromptu
public performances. They protest
authority and tradition. They went
to fucking jail because of their
music,. They're proof that punk is
likequicksabnd: the harder you fight

it, the stronger it gets.
At the same time, they don't just
fight "The Man." They tackle the
evils of society: sexism, homopho-
bia, censorship, abuse of prisoners.
And they're really earnest in what
they do. After their lecture, Nadya
and Masha went to the Washtenaw
County Youth Deterntion Center to
visit inmates, and a few days later,
were at a massive rally in New
York City to protest climate change.
They are thoughtfully, rather than
mindlessly,transgressive.
During the Q&A section of the
lecture, a balding, middle-aged man
went up to the microphone, only to
launch into an impassioned lecture
of his own. He addressed thesappall-
ing number of youths in Michigan
serving life sentences in prison, and
then urged the audience to vote for
some candidate who had pledged to
address this problem. Many in the
audience booed him, and one girl
next to me whispered "oh my god,
just shut up." Maybe he was just a
disrespectful showboat. Maybe he
was inspired by Pussy Riot. Either
way, the guy pissed off a large audi-
ence by proclaiming his beliefs.
Sounds pretty punk to me.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

The opening scene of the
music video for Jennifer
Lopez's new single "Booty
(feat. Iggy
Azalea)"
warns the
audience
to prepare JLO&IggJAka
them- Capitol
selves
for "Full Immersion," and,
frankly, the warning is neces-
sary. What follows the cin-
ematic countdown sequence
is a veritable onslaught of
ass, a deluge of derriere only
occasionally interrupted by
shots of the women they're
attached to. And I use that
problematic phrasing because
this video does everything
in its power to subsume J.Lo
and Iggy Azalea's artistic
personae under their status
as sex symbols.

I thought the "booty
wave" characterizing recent
pop releases had reached
its logical conclusion with
Nicki Minaj's "Anaconda"
video, and in a certain sense,
it did. Sure, Nicki heavily
emphasized her rump, but
she did it in a way that was
clever, colorful and, above all,

asserted the uniqueness of
her personality and aesthetic.
J.Lo's "Booty" is simply flat
and lifeless in comparison -
stunned into senselessness
by the barrage of butt, you
stumble away without having
seen anything new or even
particularly exciting.
