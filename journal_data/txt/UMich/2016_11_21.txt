Over the past few weeks, 

protests calling for action against 
discrimination on campus and 
nationwide 
have 
swept 
the 

University, drawing thousands. 
More than 100 times that number 
— about 110,000 spectators — 
watched the football team beat 
Indiana this weekend at The Big 
House, a place that can seem a 
world away from student activity 
on campus with its cameras and 
fanfare. This football season, 
however, student-athletes have 
bridged the gap on a number 
of issues, using their platform 
to call attention to social issues 
like racism and police brutality 

through demonstrations of their 
own.

University football players and 

cheerleaders have followed in the 
footsteps of San Francisco 49ers 
quarterback Colin Kaepernick, 
who began kneeling during the 
national anthem in late August 
in protest of racism against 
Black 
Americans. 
Michigan 

student-athletes 
have 
raised 

fists or taken a knee during the 
national anthem in nearly every 
game this year, beginning with 
the Sept. 24 Big Ten conference 
home opener against Penn State. 
National outlets from ESPN to 
ABC covered the players’ initial 
actions and Michigan coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh’s 
subsequent 

remarks. Though it’s been two 

Tom Lewand, a University 

alum and CEO of Shinola, a 
Detroit-based company, lectured 
Friday to an audience of about 
300 students and faculty at the 
University of Michigan about his 
experiences working in Detroit.

The event, held in Rackham 

Auditorium, was hosted by Phi 
Chi Theta, a business fraternity 
at the University.

Lewand 
said 
Detroit 
has 

played 
an 
integral 
role 
in 

his life and in the crafting of 
Shinola. He also spoke about his 
experiences nurturing a startup 
into a successful brand and the 
knowledge he gained from 20 
years in the executive office of the 
Detroit Lions, saying even after 
he was fired by the Lions after 
several disappointing seasons, he 
still wanted to stay in Detroit.

“We sensed, for the first time in 

my lifetime, a tremendous energy, 
a tremendous opportunity and 
just a tremendous activity in our 
community,” Lewand said.

Lewand was hired by Shinola 

in June 2016. He emphasized that 
skills he learned while in sports 
management have been largely 
transferrable to Shinola.

“We had to have a great 

product first, and then we had 
to give people a great experience 
and that’s the same thing at 
Shinola,” Lewand said, joking 
that a great product wasn’t 
always commonplace while he 
was with the Lions.

He also described what it was 

like to walk through the floor of 
the factory for the first time and 
listen to employees’ stories prior 
to being at Shinola.

“It’s the idea of doing well 

by doing good,” Lewand said, 
speaking to how the stories have 
inspired him.

Shinola 
has 
based 
their 

reputation on the long-standing 
narrative of manufacturing in 
Detroit, though they’ve faced 

criticism 
becasue 
parts 
for 

their products are largely not 
actually made there. This June, 
the Federal Trade Commission 
told Shinola to stop their slogan 
campaign that used phrases such 
as “Where American is Made,” 
noting that nearly 100 percent of 
the company’s watch materials 
are made overseas.

In response, Shinola added 

the phrase “Swiss and Imported 
Parts” underneath the slogan 

“Built in Detroit” on their 
watches.

In 
his 
remarks, 
Lewand 

emphasized 
his 
belief 
that 

Shinola’s 
underlying 
goal 
is 

to play a role in the economic 
development 
of 
Detroit 

by creating jobs and other 
opportunities in the community. 
Business 
sophomore 
Megan 

Graham, who attended the event, 
echoed his sentiment, saying she 

After a sloppy, snowy start that 

saw both Michigan and Indiana 
punt on their first three drives 
and the Hoosiers take a 7-3 lead 
into halftime, the 3rd-ranked 
Michigan 
football 
team 
was 

on upset alert for the second 
consecutive week.

It was a shaky debut for 

redshirt junior quarterback John 
O’Korn — who made his first 
start for the Wolverines in place 
of the injured Wilton Speight — 
but luckily for Michigan, it had 
another star to throw its weight 
behind.

Senior running back De’Veon 

Smith broke the game open with 
a career-high 158 yards and two 
huge touchdown runs from 34 
and 39 yards out in the third 
quarter, and the Wolverines (7-1 
Big Ten, 10-1 overall) pulled away 
with a 20-10 victory as snow 
covered the field at Michigan 
Stadium.

“It’s a great feeling when 

you win a football game,” said 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh. 
“Two opposing wills against each 
other — you have to beat that

LSA freshman Emily Levy speaks at the Students for a Democratic Society “No To Trump” rally on the Diag Friday.

About 150 students and Ann 

Arbor 
residents 
gathered 
on 

the Diag Friday night to protest 
President-elect Donald Trump’s 
agenda, calling for institutional 
reform nationwide.

The 
demonstration 
was 

sponsored 
by 
the 
University 

of 
Michigan’s 
Students 
for 
a 

Democratic Society chapter. LSA 
freshman 
Liam 
Knight, 
who 

brought the chapter back to the 
University after the original chapter 
died out, said while the Facebook 
event specifically targeted Trump, 
the main goal of the protest was 

to fight larger institutions of 
discrimination and corruption in 
America.

“What we want to emphasize is 

that the problem is much larger than 
just one person,” he said. “There are 
systems and structures of power 
that allowed someone like Donald 
Trump to get elected and that is 
what we have to oppose. We want 

to make it very clear that the only 
way you can do that is by getting 
organized and protesting.”

In a list of demands on the event 

page, speakers from SDS criticized 
war, 
racism, 
gender 
identity 

discrimination and corruption from 
both sides of the political spectrum.

Sunday’s “With All That I 

Am” open mic night for poets, 
storytellers and musicians aimed 
to provide University of Michigan 
students a space to perform and 
raise awareness about diversity 
and inclusion on campus.

Music, 
Theatre 
& 
Dance 

freshman 
Mason 
Reeves 

performed four original poems. 
He said the recent political 
climate in the wake of President-
elect 
Donald 
Trump’s 
win 

encouraged him to produce more 
of his own works.

“I’ve been inspired a lot to 

create, and I think the only way 
for me to get better at creating to 
the point where I can get people 
to listen is to at least try it out and 
keep performing,” he said.

Music, 
Theatre 
& 
Dance 

freshman Liam Allen said he 
thought this was an important 
venue for students to come 
together.

“I think a lot of the time 

people need an outlet, a space to 
feel that they are able to express 
themselves and have it be OK,” he 
said.

Football fans saw the 

fickle nature of Michigan 
weather this weekend when 
it swung from a sunny, warm 
70 degrees Friday to a chilling 
low of 30 degrees Saturday, 
along with a dusting of snow 
on The Big House, during 
Michigan’s final home football 
game.

Despite the cold, Michigan 

fans celebrated their 20-10 
win against Indiana by taking 
to the field and making snow 
angels.

Snow fell heavily during 

the game as well, forcing the 
players to play on a slippery 
field. With one game left, 
Michigan is 10-1-0 this season.

The victorious, snowy end 

was the last home game of 
the season — a potential relief 
after Michigan’s loss to Iowa 
14-13 last Saturday. Michigan 
is currently ranked at No. 3 in 

the AP poll.

The game also led to a 

different kind of ranking. 

According to Michigan 
Football’s Twitter account, 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 

has reached 20 wins faster 
than all but one another coach 
in Michigan history.

Allen performed an original 

song 
with 
his 
own 
guitar 

accompaniment.

“When you can look into the 

eyes of the person performing, 
it’s a different way you can 
connect to it — it’s much more 
intimate,” he said.

The 
event 
was 
hosted 

by 
MOSAIC: 
Intercultural 

Performance 
Ensemble, 
a 

student organization dedicated 
to creating live art to increase 
diversity and representation on 
campus.

Music, Theatre & Dance senior 

Aline Mayagoitia, the creative 
director of MOSAIC, said the 
event 
was 
an 
opportunity 

for students to express their 
thoughts on important issues 
in a way that is not normally 
facilitated at the University.

“We 
are 
a 
presenting 

organization, 
so 
we 
usually 

couple with student theater or 
other organizations to make 
pieces that have either a cast or 
creative team or a voice that is 

usually not represented in other 
organizations on campus,” she 
said.

Mayagoitia said this was the 

first non-theater performance 
MOSAIC 
has 
hosted, 
with 

students 
presenting 
original 

works from poems to songs, as 
well as reenacting excerpts from 
plays and other performances 
they have been a part of.

“Identity is so much more 

complicated 
than 
what 
our 

binary systems want us to believe 
it is, and I think a really good way 
to express complicated things 
is through art and through 
poetry, music and storytelling,” 
Mayagoitia said. “Today is about 
us, as artists, as poets, as people, 
expressing our own words.”

During the event, Mayagoitia 

spoke 
about 
recent 
campus 

events, 
including 
student 

protests in the Ann Arbor 
community, saying this open mic 
night aimed to create a safe space 
for underrepresented students to 
speak up.

“We 
think 
we’re 

understanding and we think 
we’re so open and yet, there are 
still crimes that are happening 
at our doorstep, and still a lot 

of hate that we need to combat 
with expressing ourselves and 
plainly saying who we are,” she 
said. “That’s where the title came 
from.”

Elyakeem Avraham, a junior 

in LSA and Music, Theatre & 
Dance and the associate director 
MOSAIC, said he hoped the 
event would widen the lens and 
perception of audience members 
so they could leave with an open 
mind about different identities.

“I really want them to be able 

to know that there are ways 
to articulate, understand and 
educate yourselves about other 
identities that people hold,” he 
said.

The 
open 
mic 
included 

excerpts 
from 
“For 
Colored 

Girls,” 
a 
show 
directed 
by 

Avraham and set to be performed 
on Central Campus this February.

“It’s the coming-of-age story 

about 
everybody’s 
personal 

identities and everything they 
hold within,” Avraham said. “A 
lot of times the media perpetrates 
or stereotypes people for a lot 
of things that can cascade over 
their whole ethnicity or race, 
religion or sexual orientation. 
With All That I Am is basically 

that 
personalization 
and 

humanization 
of 
people 

individually, and that’s what 
our community is hungry for 
and needs.”

Reeves and Allen said these 

kind of events are particularly 
important for students today 
and they hope to continue 
working with MOSAIC to 
perform self-produced work 
and audition for larger campus 
productions.

“I think that a lot of times 

when people are having casual 
conversation they can put up 
a blockage and there can be a 
kind of force field around them 
so you can’t intuitively see 
through them,” Avraham said. 
“But the interesting thing that 
a performance does is that it 
gives people that time capsule, 
that blank space to be a canvas 
and to create and allow people 
to really see their true colors. 
I think live performance has 
a way to interpret what we 
feel in actual life that we can’t 
say in everyday conversation 
because it isn’t in our casual 
dialogue to do so.”

included 
rhythmic 
call-and-

repeats such as “All these racist 
politicians we don’t need em” and 
“When Muslims are under attack, 
what do we do?” with the crowd 
responding “Stand up, fight back.”

In attendance was the first SDS 

president, University alum Alan 
Haber, who graduated in 1965. 
In speaking to the crowd, Haber, 
a self-proclaimed “senior for a 
Democratic society,” emphasized 
that both the Democrat and 
Republican parties in this country 
support the act of war and students 
must stand together to fight both 
issues and individuals.

“Don’t be heartbroken that 

we don’t have Mrs. Clinton as 
our president,” Haber said. “This 
woman, very good on some things, 
is basically an advocate for the war 
system. Politics in this country has 
not gotten itself out of this imperial 
mode … Trump isn’t changing that 
and Hillary wouldn’t have changed 
that. That’s for us to do.”

During the event, recent campus 

crime alerts were cited as direct 
acts of racism by speakers and 
attendees. Last Friday, a woman 
was told she would be lit on fire if 
she did not remove her hijab while 
walking downtown. The next day, 
two men pushed a woman down 
a hill and yelled at her for being in 
America.

LSA freshman Sonny Newman 

said the attacks on campus are part 
of a larger attitude of discrimination 
toward all minorities on campus, 

including non-cisgender people.

“How can we say that Ann 

Arbor is safe when my friend 
was called a faggot the other day 
while walking to class?” Newman 
said. “How can we say that Ann 
Arbor is safe when earlier this 
year, when pronouns were added 
to class rosters at U of M, there 
was a backlash? People like Grant 
Strobl changed their pronouns on 
Wolverine Access to things like 
‘His Majesty’ and encouraged 
others to do the same using the 
hashtag #UMPronounChallenge. 
Well I am inviting all of you to take 
the real UM Pronoun Challenge. 
This 
entails 
asking 
people’s 

pronouns and respecting them.”

The issue of racial and social 

impct on the election was brought 
up by Ann Arbor resident Joel 
Reinstein, who said because the 
law does not allow former felons 
and undocumented citizens to vote, 
Trump was given an advantage.

“People are living in this country 

and working in this country 
who have no representation in 
the government they live under 
because they are undocumented. 
Fuck that,” Reinstein said.

Speaking to how the University 

is responding to multiple recent 
anti-Trump protests on campus 
and the student outcry about 
discrimination, Knight said in 
an interview he thought the 
University as well as University 
President Mark Schlissel are going 
about the issue in the wrong way 
with their poster campaign. The 
posters feature slogans such as 
“Listen More, Judge Less” and 
“Appreciate Our Differences.”

“The point is not that people 

are disagreeing disrespectfully,” 
Knight said. “It’s not an issue of 
values bring different. It’s an issue 
of people are trying to spread hate 
and we have to take the stance 
that this is not acceptable full 
stop. We will not tolerate white 
supremacists on this campus ever 
and I don’t think the University has 
taken the extra step that they really 
need to do.”

Ann 
Arbor 
resident 
Katie 

Whitney, a protester who was in 
the crowd with her five-year-old 
daughter, was holding a sign made 
of duct tape that said “Hate Ain’t 
Great.” Whitney said she brought 
her daughter to the protest because 
she wanted her daughter to see her 
parents standing up to “powers of 
white supremacy and saying no we 
don’t accept this.”

“I’m here because something’s 

got to give,” Whitney said. “I used 
to not be particularly an activist. 
I cared about issues but since this 
election, I have been truly afraid 
for my friends and my family. My 
husband is Jewish and said we 
need to start making plans for 
how to leave this country and that 
scares me.”

LSA freshman Emily Levy, 

who had never attended a protest 
before this year, said she wanted 
people in Ann Arbor to continue 
demonstrating and showing both 
the University and the country that 
collective voices cannot be ignored.

“After this rally is over, after 

the Diag turns back to normal, life 
goes on, you all go home, I want one 
thing from you. I don’t want this to 
be the last time I see any of you in a 
crowd like this. I want all of you to 
keep fighting,” Levy said.

other team and also the elements. 
Our team did both of those things 
today.”

In 
the 
first 
half, 
the 

Wolverines’ offense stalled early 
and often, as the Hoosiers (3-5, 
5-6) had little trouble getting to 
O’Korn in the pocket. O’Korn had 
a difficult time shedding tacklers, 
and he took three tackles for loss, 
including two sacks, in the half.

Michigan went 0-for-7 on 

third down in the first frame, 
only managing a 28-yard field 
goal from Kenny Allen to get on 
the board before the Hoosiers 
answered 
with 
a 
2-yard 

touchdown 
run 
by 
Camion 

Patrick before the break.

O’Korn struggled to throw 

the ball on a cold, windy day, 
completing just 7 of 16 passes for 
59 yards. He finally turned the 
tide of the game with his feet, 
though, pulling off a 30-yard 
scramble on 3rd-and-8 that set up 
Smith’s go-ahead touchdown in 

the third quarter.

“I’m not real pleased with the 

way I threw the ball, but that’s 
part of battling the elements,” 
O’Korn said. “Gotta complete 
passes 
when 
opportunities 

present themselves. … Luckily, 
our run game and our O-line 
had my back today, and it doesn’t 
matter how we get the win as long 
as we get the win.”

Indiana had more success in the 

passing game than the Wolverines, 
as quarterback Richard Lagow 
tallied 191 total yards. His 37-yard 
pass to Nick Westbrook in the 
third quarter that ended up being 
the longest completion of the 
game for either team.

The Wolverines’ defense held 

the Hoosiers in check, though, 
tallying 11 tackles for loss — led 
by senior defensive end Taco 
Charlton’s 2.5 — and eight pass 
breakups. As a result, Indiana’s 
offense managed just a field goal.

Michigan’s special teams made 

its mark as well. Fifth-year senior 
kicker/punter Kenny Allen gave 
the Wolverines a boost in the 
field-position battle with three 
punts of more than 50 yards. 

The coverage unit also came up 
big, as fifth-year senior tight end 
Michael Jocz and freshman safety 
Khaleke Hudson both blocked 
punts in Hoosier territory.

Now, the focus will shift to 

next week’s matchup with No. 
2 Ohio State in Columbus, with 
a Big Ten Championship Game 
berth 
and 
potential 
College 

Football Playoff appearance on 
the line for Michigan.

Even with that daunting task on 

the horizon, Harbaugh is pleased 
with where his team stands, even 
despite Saturday’s early struggles 
and the Wolverines’ quarterback 
uncertainty.

“Every week is a test, every 

game that you line up is a test,” 
Harbaugh said. “There’s gonna 
be a lot of tests in life. It comes 
in many forms and fashions. 
Our team playing a really good 
Indiana football team — that was 
a huge test for us today. Coming 
off a loss — that was a huge test 
for us.

“Playing in big playoff-type 

games and responding, coming 
together as a team gives us a great 
feeling. I feel good about it.”

WHAT THE SOUND

months since athletes first began 
demonstrating in this way, at 
every game, the fists still go up, 
sometimes even without attention 
from the cameras.

Priscilla Huddleston, an LSA 

junior 
and 
cheerleader, 
said 

she feels she cannot ignore the 
platform she has on the field 
during 
the 
national 
anthem. 

Leading three other teammates, 
Huddleston was the first student 
to take a knee and raise her fist.

“It’s 
historically 
been 
the 

athlete’s position to empower 
their community,” she said. “It’s 
sparking conversations in classes. 
I only have a platform for four 
hours … I only matter in uniform, 
and I have to use that time and 
make it count. I have a block ‘M’ 
on and I’m not just supposed to 
wave a pompom and cheer you on. 
You can’t expect me to be silent. I 
didn’t understand how much of a 
platform I had until now.”

Demonstrations 
at 
the 

University mirror similar actions 
by athletes at both the collegiate 
and professional level across the 
country. Huddleston recalled a 
discussion 
with 
All-American 

senior cornerback Jourdan Lewis 
— who, along with senior tight end 
Khalid Hill, outside linebackers 
senior Mike McCray and freshman 
Devin Bush and freshman inside 
linebacker Elysee Mbem-Bosse 
participated in the demonstration 
— before the Penn State game. 
She said she and Lewis noticed 
a feeling of hypocrisy during the 
national anthem, especially in 
the wake of a series of fatal police 
shootings of Black Americans.

“Don’t sing this song, and a 

Black man just died. I haven’t sang 
(the anthem) since Ferguson,” 
she said, referring to the non-
indictment of the police officer 
who fatally shot Michael Brown. 
“(Lewis) wasn’t sure if he wanted 
to do it at first, but then he and 
other players looked at the actual 
words of the national anthem, 
and did it because they didn’t feel 
comfortable with it. I did it because 
I didn’t feel comfortable with 
the actions of law enforcement. 
Jourdan and I both said, ‘You 
know what, this is disrespectful 
against our people.’ ”

The 
University 
Athletic 

Department 
did 
not 
make 

players 
participating 
in 
the 

protest 
immediately 
available 

for comment, but in a press 
conference after the Penn State 
game, Lewis noted his long-
standing frustration with racism 
in America not only in the recent 

climate following the election, but 
more generally throughout time.

“It’s not just this week, it’s the 

whole mess,” he said. “Regardless 
of anything, I’m going to stand 
up for injustice. That wasn’t 
disrespecting anything. I love this 
University. I love this country, but 
things can get better.”

Harbaugh, 
who 
originally 

opposed Kaepernick’s “method 
of action,” reversed his position 
at the same press conference. 
He later clarified, saying that he 
supports Kaepernick’s motivation, 
but not his approach.

“Because I am the football 

coach doesn’t mean I can dictate to 
people what they believe,” he said. 
“I support our guys. I think this is 
something — it’s not going away, 
it’s going to keep happening.”

Michigan cheerleading coach 

Pam St. John supported the 
protests from the start, facilitating 
team conversations about the 
actions 
and 
blocking 
some 

cameras to protect her athletes 
from backlash. The cheer team’s 
number of minority cheerleaders 
has grown in the last few years, 
and both St. John and students 
said this has contributed to a more 
inclusive environment.

“I went to school here and 

came during the end of the 
Vietnam War during a time of 
civil unrest,” St. John said. “This 
is part of the culture that I believe 
is the University of Michigan. 
My first instinct is to protect my 
student athletes … my opinion is 
that that’s their right to do that 
as part of freedom of expression 
and freedom of speech. It’s my 
responsibility as an American to 
protect that.”

“I’ve 
never 
felt 
tokenized 

because of my coach, and she 
protects me,” Huddleston said. 
“My teammates stopped and 
listened (about the protest).”

In contrast to the football and 

cheerleading coaches, marching 
band directors released a policy 
on 
“student 
self-expression,” 

banning band members from 
engaging 
in 
demonstrations 

during 
performances. 
In 
an 

email statement, directors wrote 
the policy, dated Sept. 30, was 
a preemptive measure against 
student disruption.

“Their work as a band is nuanced 

and coordinated — any personal 
expression would disrupt the 
band’s overall performance,” the 
statement reads. “Band members 
would be held accountable for 
displays of expression during a 
performance.”

Neither 
marching 
band 

members 
nor 
directors 
were 

available for direct comment.

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel’s 
49-unit 
Diversity, 

Equity and Inclusion strategic 
plan, 
released 
in 
October, 

includes a sub-plan created by the 
University Athletic Department 
focusing on minority recruitment, 
diversity and cultural sensitivity 
training 
for 
coaching 
and 

management staff and improving 
the literacy of student-athletes on 
the DEI objectives.

St. John said student action 

this year demonstrated both the 
urgency and necessity of diversity 
education in athletics.

“Staff and coaches were out in 

front of this with the DEI plan,” 
she said. “Any time awareness is 
brought, it fortifies the action.”

Kaepernick’s original protest 

drew 
objections 
from 
many 

pundits 
and 
commentators 

accusing him of a lack of patriotism 
and of disrespecting the national 
anthem. While most criticism of 
University participants has been 
relegated to social media, teams 
have still reckoned with internal 
disagreements. In an interview, 
defensive end Ron Johnson, an 
LSA freshman, voiced personal 
disagreement with the fist raising, 
but emphasized the team’s overall 
support.

“Players did it of their own will,” 

he said. “I want to show respect for 
people who fight for our country 
… I’ve been singing the national 
anthem all my life, and I just think 
there’s other ways of going about 
it. We haven’t talked about it as a 
full team, but every game they still 
keep doing it.”

Huddleston pushed back against 

the idea that the demonstrations 
disrespect those who serve the 
country, recounting her experience 
kneeling 
before 
the 
Oct. 
22 

homecoming game against Illinois.

“I started freaking out because 

the Navy was right in front of me, 
and I have family members in the 
military and I know how hard 
they work,” she said. “I jumped out 
of line and went up to someone in 
uniform and cleared it with her, 
and made sure she knew it was 
not me trying to disrespect her 
and her sacrifice for her country. I 
heard her talking to her coworkers 
about it after and they were saying 
‘No, that’s extremely brave of her.’ 
It shouldn’t be that brave to protest 
something you believe in. People 
in the Navy almost die, and for 
one of them to say that, we need to 
reevaluate how we feel about our 
First Amendment rights.” 

Student-athletes 
have 
also 

been invoked in other protests 
on 
campus 
this 
year, 
with 

student organizers calling out 
the assumption that Black male 
students are athletes, with a group 
at a September protest saying, “You 
cheer us on the football field... we 
are more than your money.”

supports such efforts to employ 
Detroit natives.

“I intern for a company in 

Ann Arbor that actually employs 
women from Detroit and so I 
really resonated with the whole 
story about the startup in a city 
that is having a lot of problems,” 
she said. “I just really resonated 
with the background of Shinola 
and how that really contributes to 
the same work I’m doing now.” 

Since its inception in 2011, the 

compant made a name for itself 
as a luxury lifestyle brand, with 
products such as watches and 

leather goods, as well as other 
items such as bicycles and record 
players.

“We look at opportunity in 

the marketplace, we look at 
opportunity in our expertise, 
with the men and women who 
design our products who have 
the ideas — we are a tremendous 
entrepreneurial 
company,” 

Lewand said of the range of 
products. “We saw an opportunity 
in the audio space, just like we saw 
in the watch space.”

Lewand’s also noted Shinola’s 

success with this model.

“We’re a $100 million company 

this year but really in our third 
year of sales,” Lewand said.

Business 
senior 
Moynawk 

Gangopadhyay said he attended 

because he was interested in 
learning about that structure.

“I liked how (Lewand) talked 

about what particular branding 
strategies they have and whether 
or not they could have the scale to 
expand internationally,” he said.

Beyond product mix and sales, 

Lewand also said diversity, in 
gender, race and background, 
has played an important role 
throughout his career, from his 
time at the Lions to his time 
at Shinola. He advised crowd 
members to lead a balanced life. 

“I believe in physical, mental 

and spiritual health,” Lewand 
said. “There are three legs to the 
stool and if you don’t have all three, 
you’re not going to be successful as 
a human being.”

A

s an organic chemistry 
lab 
exam 
is 
fast 

approaching, the topic 

of studying comes up among a 
group of me and my classmates. 
How best should we prepare 
for the exam? We know we 
shouldn’t simply memorize the 
material but the temptation to 
just make up some flash cards 
and cram information into 
our brains for a short period 
of time is too great. However, 
what started as a seemingly 
normal collegiate conversation 
took a turn for the worse as the 
topic entered a dark place. No, 
not cheating, but purposefully 
“helping” other classmates by 
giving them the wrong answers 
to questions. Yes, in discussing 
how best to study, the idea 
came into fruition to actually 
lie to fellow students in order 
to boost one’s own chances of 
doing well.

As a student who aspires 

to go into the medical field, 
my mentality toward classes 
such as orgo or biochemistry 
— those that often foster such 
a competitive mindset — is do 
or die. Either I get a good grade 
and my success is secured, or 
I do not do well and I need to 
resort to my list of backup plans. 
The competitive nature of the 
courses we take has fostered 
this mindset in me as well as in 
many friends following similar 

intended career pathways.

Courses in which the top 25 

percent of students can get an 
A — even if their actual class 
grade would be the equivalent 
to a C — and the lowest 25 
percent 
are 
unfortunate 

enough to receive a D, pit 
students against one another. 
These courses promote a kind 
of competition detrimental to 
not only a student’s success 
and 
academic 
environment, 

but also the larger professional 
working world. Students who 
learn in an environment in 
which an individual’s success is 
held to a higher standard than 
accruing greater knowledge 
and sharing ideas that could 
benefit everyone undoubtedly 
carry those sentiments to their 
professional careers and future 
work environments. I don’t 
know about others, but I was 
hoping constant competition 
among my peers would end 
with 
my 
academic 
career. 

Perhaps this is just the result 
of naive daydreaming about 
becoming a doctor.

The reality is the pressures 

that exist in the academic 
community 
for 
pre-med 

hopefuls are echoed in the 
careers themselves. Physicians 
are among the highest-rated 
professions for suicide. What’s 
more, female physicians are 
two and a half to four times 
more likely to commit suicide 
than the general population. 
And more broadly, those in 
the medical field are also 

more likely to develop drug 
addictions 
and 
become 

depressed. While not all of 
these issues of mental health 
can be attributed solely to 
choosing to become a doctor, 
there is a clear link with 
immense amounts of stress 
and maintaining a professional 
career in the health industry.

Rather than suggest my peers 

find a new career pathway if 
they can’t handle the pressures 
of the medical field, feeding 
into 
the 
competition 
that 

already infests their intended 
field, I propose a culture shift. 
Why continue an ineffective 
system that results in increased 
suicide and drug addiction 
rates among our life-saving 
professionals? Why continue 
an ineffective system that pits 
students against one another 
and fosters a hostile learning 
environment? Let’s not! While 
the kinds of classes we have 
to take may never change, we 
as students have the right to 
choose the way we see our 
education. Rather than seeing 
our time here at the University 
of Michigan as a way to crush 
our competitors in order to 
become the best and brightest, 
we should view this as an 
opportunity to learn as much as 
we can from the people around 
us and do the same for others.

CAITLIN HEENAN | OP-ED

Caitlin Heenan is a senior opinion 

editor at the Daily. 

L

ike millions of people 
these past two weeks, 
I have been trying to 

understand the outcome of 
the 
presidential 

election. 
I 
have 

gathered 
so 
far 

that 
Donald 

Trump’s rise is far 
from 
monocausal. 

Rather, the election 
results 
originated 

from 
several 

sources 
including, 

but 
certainly 
not 

limited 
to, 
white 

supremacy, sexism, 
education disparity, the rural-
urban divide and a lack of 
engagement with the working 
class on the part of Democrats.

Conversations deducing how 

Trump rose to the top of U.S. 
politics have become rather 
complex. 
National 
dialogue 

and protests have constituted 
some of the reaction to the 
election. Dialogue and protests 
are a necessary next step to 
figuring out where the body 
politic goes from here. Much 
of the dialogue has focused on 
how Trump was elected and 
how liberals can move forward, 
and some of it has been taking 
place on the University of 
Michigan’s campus, along with 
several protests. Though I am 
a proponent of dialogue and 
protests, these reactions must 
focus on fixing the system 
that got us here instead of 
promoting denial of the current 
state of our national politics.

So far, the protests against 

Trump have expressed rage 
against his presidential win — 
they demonstrate the views of 
a subset of the United States 
that will never agree with his 
values. The protests display a 
United States that believes in 
denouncing 
the 
intolerance 

and demonization that Donald 
Trump used to rise to power. 
Though I think protests are 
beneficial strategies for any 
movement, it’s worth noting 
that protests will only go so 
far. For the most part, it seems 
as though protests only unite 
those who share similar beliefs. 
That is why the dialogue that 
is occurring is a necessary 
addition 
to 
the 
anti-Trump 

protests. Primarily, this dialogue 
needs to include engagement 
within the Democratic Party, 
to restructure and re-engage 
the people who decided they 
disagree with its values. That 
sort of discussion identifies 
how the left can ensure that 
people like Trump never rise to 
power again.

I believe there is a group of 

people that thinks the goals 

of anti-Trump protests are 
whining cry-babies trying to 
change the outcome of the 
election, aimed at showing 

enough 
opposition 

to Trump to make 
the Electoral College 
vote against him. I 
don’t even come close 
to agreeing with that 
framing. It may be 
easy to find a subset 
of 
protesters 
who 

are trying to change 
the election results, 
but I have yet to see 
a 
majority 
stance 

from an anti-Trump movement 
or politician attempting to 
portray the goals of protests as 
changing the outcome of the 
election. I believe the general 
and explicit purpose of these 
protests is to unite against 
the 
hateful 
values 
Trump 

propagates. However, even if 
the main goal of anti-Trump 
protests and dialogue isn’t 
to push against the election 
results, that intention persists 
in many ways in the reaction to 
Trump’s win.

Even if the major goal of 

anti-Trump protests is not 
to change the election, it has 
existed in some rhetoric on the 
left. For example, one petition 
was widely spread throughout 
liberal social circles, calling 
for the Electoral College to 
change its votes and elect 
Hillary Clinton. This argument 
is based on the idea that since 
Hillary won the popular vote, 
the Electoral College should 
unilaterally 
elect 
her 
and 

deny Donald Trump his seat 
in the Oval Office. Even if 
electors could change their 
votes, which they probably 
won’t, the argument misses 
a very important point: Even 
if 
the 
popular 
vote 
went 

to Clinton, it only did by a 
relatively small margin. We 
shouldn’t be celebrating that; 
we should be afraid of it. We 
should be questioning why so 
many people didn’t denounce 
Trump’s 
sexism, 
racism, 

homophobia and xenophobia by 
voting against him. This is the 
primary problem with denialism.

Denialism fails to figure 

out how we got here. It fails to 
question how we deconstruct 
white supremacy. It fails to 
question how liberals engage 
with the working class. It 
fails to question the role that 
Hillary Clinton’s gender played 
in her loss. It fails to figure out 
why 41.8 percent of eligible 
voters decided not to vote. 
These people decided they 
didn’t share Donald Trump’s 
values, yet also decided they 
didn’t care enough about these 
values to stop him.

A major slogan employed by 

protesters has been “not my 
president.” The point of such 
a slogan seems obvious: Many 
people in this country using 
it don’t agree with the beliefs 
of their new president-elect. 
The major problem with such 
rhetoric is that it erases a very 
obvious and important fact — 
Trump is your president. The 
left needs to remind itself of that 
every day for the next four years. 
We need to remind ourselves of 
it every time we lose sight of the 
liberal ideals of tolerance, equity 
and safety for all. We need to 
remind ourselves of that fact, as 
liberals try to restructure the 
Democratic Party to fight against 
racism, sexism, neoliberalism 
and liberal elitism.

Once again, I am not critiquing 

anti-Trump protests or dialogue. 
Instead, I am pushing for a more 
deliberate, 
thoughtful 
agenda 

that 
focuses 
on 
re-engaging 

voters. Protests and dialogue 
need to focus on understanding 
how the United States and 
Trump got here. They also need 
to engage with those who were 
not sufficiently motivated to vote 
against his presidency.

So stop chanting that he is 

not 
your 
president. 
Scream 

about how you will never accept 
Trump’s hatred. Scream love for 
the communities currently living 
in fear. Scream that you resent 
it, but that he is your president. 
Every time you say the words 
“President Donald Trump,” be 
reminded of this failure. Let it 
be a call to action about how you 
will help the communities that 
are going to be battered under a 
Trump presidency. Be reminded 
of what you are going to do to 
stop alt-right, white nationalist 
politics from continuing to rise 
in the United States.

Protests are good, but denial isn’t

Relaxing to fuel your future

ASHLEY ZHANG | OP-ED

M

y 
older 
sister, 
a 

University of Michigan 
alum of the class of 

2011, always told me that Michigan 
was a very “work hard, 
play hard” school, but 
it’s a phrase that cannot 
be 
fully 
understood 

until 
you 
stay 
on 

campus for a weekend 
and see for yourself 
the 
stark 
disparity 

between a Saturday 
and 
Sunday 
night. 

The former is filled 
with debauchery and 
cheer, the darkened 
streets swarming with people 
fighting the bitter cold on their 
way to the next party. One day 
later, the streets are silent and 
still, and it’s near impossible to 
find an open seat in the library.

The overnight transformation 

is jarring, but it’s a reputation 
that Michigan students have 
always been proud of. However, 
the merits of the “work hard, play 
hard” lifestyle are questionable.

I hadn’t even realized how 

much I’d bought into it until I 
was heading back to my sleepy, 
suburban hometown of Troy, 
Mich., for Fall Break after a 
mere month and a half of college. 
It was like slipping into summer. 
After all, last time I’d been 
home, it had been summer, free 
of worries, midterms and stress. 
Being back in that environment 
made it far too easy to fall back 
into the ways of lazy, hazy days: 
wake up at noon, scroll through 
Netflix, pick a movie because 
“TV shows are too much of 
a time commitment,” snack 
intermittently, 
stop 
halfway 

through out of boredom, pick 
another one, rinse and repeat.

The next day, I became a 

mall person, the same kind 
Cristina Yang marveled at like 
aliens in season seven of “Grey’s 
Anatomy.” Yes, I just moseyed 
and ate mall foods and bought 
mall things without having to 
worry about catching the last 
office hours before I had no 
more chances. And it was divine.

Until Fall Break came to 

an end, and my to-do list was 
longer than it had been before. 
As I buckled down in the library 
to catch up, I felt terribly guilty 
about wasting away the days of 
break while my friends stayed 
on campus and both studied 
and partied late into the night.

You 
see, 
home is where 

productivity goes to die. On a 
college campus full of students, 
there 
is 
a 
general 
vibe 
of 

studiousness and academia. There 

are countless libraries, 
academic 
buildings 

and 
study 
spaces 

guaranteed to have 
students hard at work. 
In that environment, 
surrounded 
by 
so 

many people studying, 
it’s hard not to join the 
bandwagon. In a study 
by the City University 
of 
New 
York, 

commuter 
students 

were interviewed, and it was found 
that many valued campus libraries 
as quiet, distraction-free places 
to study in comparison to the 
distractions in transit or at home.

Though its source may be a 

mix of peer pressure and fear of 
societal judgment, productivity 
on college campuses cannot be 
called a bad thing. However, 
I’ve seen that same mix of peer 
pressure and fear of societal 
judgment 
encourage 
toxic 

behaviors in the same stroke.

Snapchats of coffee at all hours 

of the day, complaints of staying 
in the library until 2, 3, 4 a.m. that 
hinge on bragging and offers of 
stimulants like Adderall are all 
common on a college campus, 
where everyone is trying to 
get ahead, sleep is “overrated” 
and success, sleep and sobriety 
are presumed to be mutually 
exclusive. Somehow, lack of sleep 
has become a badge of honor 
these days, and it’s turning high 
schoolers and college students 
into exhausted zombies who 
think a mere three or four hours 
of sleep is the norm.

A common exchange heard on 

campus goes as follows:

Person A: “I’m so tired. I stayed 

up ’til 3 a.m. writing a paper.”

Person B: “I’m worse than you. 

I didn’t sleep ’til 4 a.m. studying 
for an exam.” 

Person C: “You guys slept? 

Lucky. I pulled an all-nighter to 
finish this project.”

Somehow, 
it’s 
become 
a 

competition to see who can 
survive with the least sleep, and 
I’ve even been guilty myself of 
bragging about supplementing 
lack of sleep with unhealthy 
amounts of caffeine. However, the 
side effects of sleeplessness are 
more serious than the bleariness 
and exhaustion of the next day. 
Scientists at Oxford, Cambridge, 

Harvard, Manchester and Surrey 
universities have found that lack 
of sleep can increase the risk of 
severe health problems, including 
cancer, heart disease, type 2 
diabetes and obesity.

Moreover, sleep deprivation 

may aggravate depression or 
even cause an anxiety disorder, 
illnesses 
for 
which 
college 

students — swimming in stress 
and away from home — are 
already at risk. While night owls 
may believe that they are getting 
ahead by gulping coffee late 
into the night, they are actually 
slowly jeopardizing their health 
and, by extension, their future. 
Meanwhile, students who do get 
in their full eight hours of sleep 
are made to believe that they 
are weak or falling behind their 
peers. This sleep deprivation 
competition benefits no one.

Perhaps sleepless weeks would 

not be so harmful if students 
took their days off to relax and 
recharge, 
but 
unfortunately, 

most college students’ idea of 
“relaxation” 
is 
partying 
and 

drowning 
their 
stresses. 
It’s 

certainly not healthy for students 
to suffer through sleepless weeks 
with the promise of an alcohol-
fueled weekend pushing them to 
study into the early hours of the 
morning. By Sunday night, all 
the forgotten homework creeps 
up again, and students cram into 
libraries until dawn to make up 
for the wild weekend. And the 
toxic cycle of sleep deprivation 
and intoxication repeats.

So how, then, does one find the 

perfect balance between work 
and play? Take breaks when 
they’re needed and don’t feel 
guilty about it. Whether you’re 
returning home for Thanksgiving 
break or staying on campus, eat 
up, rest easy and forget about 
the stresses of school for a while. 
While schoolwork is important 
and the air of academia on campus 
is a wonderful environment to 
study in, it’s also important to 
take a break from time to time. 
Whether that break is becoming 
a “mall person,” sleeping in until 
noon or just going home, just 
remember that taking a breather 
isn’t equivalent to weakness or 
falling behind. Rather, it’s fuel for 
the future.

Good thing she loves herself!

 “The Edge of Seventeen” 

is not a movie we deserve, but 
a movie we need. The film 
is the directorial debut for 
screenwriter 
Kelly 
Fremon 

Craig (“Post Grad”). The idea of 
a movie about a 
girl that’s written 
and directed by a 
woman (a former 
girl) 
is 
already 

(unfortunately) 
refreshing, 
but 

Craig also fills her 
film with enough 
humor and heart to 
feel new even in a 
jam-packed genre. 

For a long time, 

the halls of high school have 
preferred the small screen, with 
shows like “The O.C.” and “Gossip 
Girl” taking the place of “Clueless” 
and “10 Things I Hate About You.” 
“The Edge of Seventeen” feels like 
the rare instance when you run 
into someone you used to know 
and it isn’t awful — it’s actually 
weirdly wonderful.

Nadine, played brilliantly by 

Hailee Steinfeld (“Pitch Perfect 
2”), is nervous and awkward. Her 
sanity hinges on her relationship 
with her only friend Krista (Haley 
Lu Richardon, “The Bronze”), so 
naturally all hell breaks loose 
inside Nadine’s almost-seventeen-
year-old brain when Krista starts 
dating her older brother Darien 
(Blake Jenner, “Everybody Wants 

Some!!”).

Steinfeld is back, giving the 

kind of performance we haven’t 
seen from her since her breakout 
role in the Coen brothers’ “True 
Grit” remake. The Nadine she 
creates is at any moment both 
heartbreakingly 
relatable 
and 

wholly 
unlikable.What 
“The 

Edge of Seventeen” captures 

so 
masterfully 

is 
the 
intensity 

of 
emotions 
at 

that age and the 
loneliness 
that 

comes from feeling 
them. 
Nadine 

feels, like many 
teenagers 
do, 

completely alone 
in her suffering. 
Craig treats the 
absurdity of these 

feelings with exquisite empathy 
and gentleness.

Sure, 
it’s 
familiar. 
Major 

plot points of teen movies are 
hit — fight with a friend, close 
relationship 
with 
a 
teacher, 

awkward sexual encounter with 
the wrong boy before ending up 
with the right one. The movie 
walks the line of cliché, but its 
familiarity works in its favor, 
conveying a sense of universality 
and breathing originality into 
stock scenes. The song Nick 
(Alexander Calvert, “Arrow”), 
Nadine’s bad boy crush, plays 
in the car for Nadine — Angus 
& Julia Stone’s “Big Jet Plane” 
— is exactly the sort of song a 
boy would have played for me in 
high school. It knows its world 

and stays true to it. The attention 
to detail from the soundtrack 
to Nadine’s costuming creates 
a world that is both intricately 
singular 
and 
emotionally 

universal.

That treatment gets extended 

to all of the characters. There 
are no villains in “The Edge of 
Seventeen.” Even Krista, whose 
transgression could have easily 
been spun as betrayal, is a good 
person who cares deeply about 
Nadine. No one is a stereotype 
and no one — not even Nick, who 
has very limited screen time — is 
one-dimensional. It’s refreshingly 
realistic and the strongest force 
keeping “Seventeen” away from 
the forgettable teen movie abyss.

The biggest issue with “The 

Edge of Seventeen” has nothing 
to do with the movie itself, but 
rather with the fact that the 
Motion 
Picture 
Association 

of America gave the film an R 
rating. That’s absurd. So, okay, 
it fails the one “fuck” test, 
there’s underage drinking and 
some bra-on almost-sex. In the 
age of the internet, where any 
thirteen-year-old can, with very 
few clicks, find as many nipples 
and swear words as they want, 
it seems naïve to think that no 
one under the age of seventeen 
is fit to see a movie like “The 
Edge of Seventeen.” It’s also 
disappointing 
because 
this 

is exactly the sort of movie I 
needed at fifteen or sixteen and 
also exactly the sort of movie I 
would never, at that age, want to 
see with my parents.

‘Seventeen’ captures teen 
loneliness with nuance

MADELEINE GAUDIN

Daily Arts Writer

Director Kelly Fremon Craig debuts with new young adult classic

I

n the past two weeks since 
Donald Trump was elected the 
next president of the United 

States, my weekly TV schedule has 
seemed less important than ever. 
Sure, TV is good for escapism, but 
in the face of such horrific things 
happening in the real world, 
whether I’ll catch up on “How to Get 
Away with Murder” or make time to 
binge “Transparent” 
suddenly 
seems 

trivial.

Of 
course, 
I 

quickly remembered 
that 
in 
times 
of 

political turmoil, art 
is more important 
than ever. A wealth 
of 
smart 
pieces 

have been written 
about this already. 
Genevieve 
Koski 

recently quoted Roger Ebert’s 
famous speech in which he claims, 
“the movies are like a machine that 
generates empathy,” arguing that 
by setting out to engage with every 
piece of pop culture we encounter, 
we become more understanding 
people. The Michigan Daily’s own 
Dayton Hare suggested that artists 
are obligated to “bring people 
together into the oneness of human 
existence.”

As I caught up on my shows 

recently, I realized that part of the 
reason I assumed Hillary Clinton 
would become president is that I 
watch an overwhelming amount 
of progressive, liberal-minded TV. 
Most of my favorite new fall shows 
have female leads — “Fleabag” and 
“The Good Place,” for example. 
Most of my favorite returning 
shows have predominantly female 
casts with a wealth of roles for 
women of color, like “Jane the 
Virgin” and “Orange is the New 
Black.” Hollywood most definitely 
still has a long way to go in terms 
of bringing marginalized groups to 
the screen — just look at last year’s 
Oscars controversy — but we’re in a 
period of unprecedented onscreen 
diversity. Being so used to that 
diversity, so used to the feminist 
beliefs I see regularly espoused 
on my favorite shows, has only 
emphasized how much of a bubble 
I live in.

Living in a bubble can have 

negative 
consequences 
if 
you 

assume the rest of the world is the 
same as yours, but I don’t mean to 

say that these progressive shows 
got Trump elected. With the 
impending Trump presidency, it’s 
crucial that we continue to work 
to populate the TV landscape with 
people of all races, sexualities, 
gender identities and ages. Still, 
though — in this time of darkness, 
I remember how far TV and movies 
have come, and it gives me hope.

Take the recent 

trend 
of 
casual 

abortions on TV. In 
the past few weeks, 
three shows have 
featured 
women 

who 
make 
the 

decision to terminate 
their 
pregnancies 

without fanfare or 
excessive agonizing. 
Too often, abortion 
is portrayed as an 

absolute last resort, a tragic decision 
that women should only make in the 
case of rape or some particularly 
vulgar circumstance. Lindsay from 
“You’re the Worst” may be a terrible 
partner and a terrible person, but 
ultimately her choice to get an 
abortion is the sanest choice she’s 
made this season. Lindsay knows 
it would be irresponsible to raise a 
child with a man who frequently 
revolts her, and it would be cruel 
to use a child to force herself into 
staying in a marriage she doesn’t 
really want.

Meanwhile, what’s revolutionary 

about seeing Lindsay or Paula 
from “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” or 
Xiomara from “Jane the Virgin” 
get an abortion is that these women 
aren’t rape survivors, or teens who 
accidentally get pregnant and have 
to “pay the consequences.” These 
are 
middle-aged 
women 
who 

emphatically don’t want to have 
more children, so they choose not 
to. It’s that simple.

I 
also 
recently 
watched 

“Moonlight,” a film that’s so 
personal, layered and subversive 
that I don’t even know how to 
begin to explain its radicalness. 
“Moonlight” isn’t exactly a feel-
good movie, but I left the theater in 
awe, convinced that writer-director 
Barry Jenkins was capable of really 
changing the way people think 
about race and sexuality.

Of all the art I’ve taken in since 

Nov. 8, though, nothing provoked so 
visceral and immediate a reaction 
in me as the season finale of “Better 

Things.” 
“Better 
Things” 
has 

brought tears to my eyes in more 
than half its episodes, but I was still 
shocked at my own reaction when I 
watched the last scene. As Sam and 
her daughters sing along to “Only 
Women Bleed” by Alice Cooper, 
the camera cuts to a wide shot of 
their minivan barreling down the 
highway, a single line of text below 
closing out the season: “dedicated to 
my daughters.”

There was something about that 

line that made me tear up every 
time I even remembered it for the 
rest of the day — something about 
the simplicity of it, the way it felt so 
quiet and elegant yet so enormously 
important. At the end of the day, 
we want our daughters to feel like 
they’re understood and respected 
and loved — not just because they’re 
our daughters, but because they’re 
people.

As 
an 
upper-middle 
class, 

straight, 
white 
male, 
I 
am 

the apotheosis of privilege. If 
“Moonlight” profoundly affected 
me, I can’t imagine how it must 
feel to be a gay Black boy watching 
his own identity — an identity 
rarely 
acknowledged, 
onscreen 

or otherwise — come to life. And 
as emotional as it made me, the 
dedication in “Better Things” must 
mean more to the women who 
see it, women who are regularly 
denigrated 
with 
cumulative 

microaggressions and explicitly 
hateful acts of violence.

Of course, we can’t let inclusive 

TV trick us into thinking the whole 
world is this open-minded. More 
importantly, we can’t let ourselves 
subside into complacency just 
because watching a show with 
an all-Black cast gives us the 
superficial appearance of social 
activists. I’m not advocating for 
ignoring reality and being blindly 
optimistic about the state of our 
country just because “Atlanta” and 
“Insecure” have been renewed for 
second seasons. I just think that in a 
time when it can be so hard to even 
log onto Twitter without seeing 
some heinous news pointing toward 
massive societal regression, the 
increasingly progressive state of TV 
is a small, hopeful sign. Sometimes, 
all you need to regain your faith in 
humanity is a little sign: a shot of a 
Black boy drenched in moonlight, or 
a four-word dedication. Sometimes, 
little signs are all we have.

Searching for hope on a TV screen

‘Better Things’ and ‘Moonlight’ offer glimmer of positivity in the void

A

“The Edge of 
Seventeen”

Rave & Quality 16

STX Entertainment

At the beginning of her memoir, 

Laura Jane Grace writes, “It was 
put to me bluntly that ‘little boys 
don’t play with Barbie dolls like 
little girls do,’ and that was that.” 
This moment was 
one of many that 
marked 
Grace’s 

earliest 
memories 

of battling gender 
dysphoria 
as 
a 

child, a battle that 
would 
continue 

throughout most of 
her life until 2012, 
when Grace came 
out as transgender. Her coming 
out reconciled her inner desire for 
femininity, internalized for years 
through sex, drugs and her own 
music — and was all detailed in her 
writings as any work of great rock 
‘n’ roll literature should.

Grace started her journey of 

dealing with gender dysphoria 
at a young age, and tackled it by 
starting one of the most widely 
celebrated punk bands in recent 
memory, Against Me! In her latest 
work, Grace has taken her first 
dive into the world of literature 
with a memoir that explicitly 
captures her war with gender 
dysphoria, placed beside journal 
excerpts specifying the struggles 
and rewards of life as a touring 
musician. Her journey is called 
“Tranny: Confessions of Punk 
Rock’s Most Infamous Anarchist 
Sellout.”

“Privately 
I’ve 
always 
had 

aspirations to be a writer. It’s 
something I’ve always wanted to 
do,” Grace said in an interview 
with The Michigan Daily. “I’ve 

always been a songwriter and a 
lyricist, but I’ve always been a fan 
of literature and an avid reader.”

In reflecting on deciding to 

write the memoir, Grace said, “It 
seemed like reconciling with the 
past, which is kind of the first step 
to take in going forward.”

In her book, Grace recognizes 

the importance of 
self-forgiveness 
and cleaning the 
skeletons out of 
her 
closet. 
This 

is another reason 
the 
book 
is 
so 

incredibly human 
— it’s a beautiful 
tribute to her past 
difficulties.

“It got to the point about four 

years ago where I kind of just 
realized that the physical and the 
metaphysical weight of everything 
was too much,” she said. “You 
know, like, the sheer amount of 
boxes of journals that were in my 
closet, I felt like we ought to do 
something with them, and that 
there had to be a book in it.”

So Grace, along with her friend, 

editor and co-writer Dan Ozzi, 
condensed a million and a half 
words of her journal entries into 
an eighty-thousand word story, 
detailing her rise from starting 
a small band in Gainesville, Fla. 
to becoming an icon not only in 
punk rock, but also in the LGBTQ 
community. For years, Grace has 
been fighting for her community 
through her punk ethos, and it 
only becomes more inspiring as it 
resounds throughout “Tranny.”

“Punk 
rock 
does 
mean 

something to me you know, and 
like I’m thankful for the influence 
it’s had on my life and I still think 
with a punk mentality,” she said.

In the memoir, we see Grace 

embody punk rock, using it as her 
armor, shield and weapon in her 
outward battle with society and 
inward battle with dysphoria. It’s 
an ideology she’s employed since 
she was thirteen, and one that has 
taken even greater precedence 
in the increasingly hostile social 
environment of modern America.

With 
recent 
political 
and 

social upheavals, Grace’s story of 
transition is more relevant than 
ever. Grace realizes this, and 
realizes 2017 will be daunting, 
delivering 
words 
of 
fierce 

encouragement — “the punk in me 
is saying, ‘fight back.’ ”

It’s a universal notion: hold on 

tight to whatever is important 
to you and use it to stand tall and 
fight back. It’s a crucial mentality 
to have in a world where not all 
identities are respected equally.

“The system is full of shit, and 

that’s why resistance movements 
need to be there, and that’s why 
protest music needs to be there 
and that’s why politically minded 
music needs to be there,” she said.

Grace is just as ready to destroy 

barriers with her art today as she 
was as a an anarchist teenager, and 
it’s a notion perfectly encapsulated 
by her journey in “Tranny.” The 
memoir is a testament to creating 
a better tomorrow by fighting both 
inner demons and those around 
you.

This coming Monday at 7 p.m., 

Grace will be in Ann Arbor at 
Circus Bar in support of the new 
book, and a ticket to the event 
includes a copy of the powerful 
memoir. Attendees will see Grace 
recount not only the rise of the 
iconic Against Me!, but also a story 
of self-discovery and finding inner 
clarity.

FILM REVIEW

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

KENDALL JENNER

In the words of Paris Hilton, “that’s hot.”

Somewhere, on the night 

of 
Kendall 
Jenner’s 
21st 

birthday, Paris Hilton laughed. 
Not because she was denied 
access to a club — although 
her track record is not clean of 
such incidents. No, that brisk 
November 
evening, 
Hilton 

laughed for all that she once 
loved.

The outfit Jenner donned 

for her special day was a direct 
reference 
to 
everything 
the 

fashion world has worked to 
forget: the first ten years of the 
21st century. She found a photo 
of Hilton in a racy crystal slip, 
and redid it in the form of a nine 
thousand dollar imitation.

2006 was back, if only for a 

night.

This is not me urging you 

resurrect your shutter shades and 
Livestrong wristbands. Please do 
not. Rather, I’m here to address 
what 
most 
industry 
experts 

have long since stuffed in a junk 
drawer alongside their Neopets. 
No, not their Hannah Montana 
Fan Club memorabilia (which 
I definitely do not have). I’m 
talking about early 2000s fashion 
in the United States of America.

The fashion of this 
first 

decade was, above all, fun. Color 
coordination was a must. If you 
didn’t have pink clip-in hair 
extensions, you could probably 
say goodbye to your Pictochat 
group. Using a scarf as a belt? 
Congratulations on your street 
cred. Not even the popularity of 
TV programs like “The Fashion 
Police” (may Queen Rivers rest 
in peace) could stop Ashley 
Tisdale from wearing a pleated 
skirt over her gauchos. I can’t 
really pretend to know what 
sparked this ten-year wave of 
rampant eccentricism, but I sure 
am glad I was here to see it wash 
over an entire country.

Though some of the most 

poignant 
examples 
of 
this 

movement 
involve 
women’s 

fashion, men, too, made their 
fair share of bold clothing 
choices. Baggy jeans for the hip-
hop set, fedoras for the scholarly 

types. Before he became the 
poster child of the modern-day 
streetwear movement, Kanye 
West was a 2000s fashion icon, 
advocating for neon sweaters 
and unnecessary scarves simply 
by wearing them in public.

Perhaps such quirkiness was 

merely an outgrowth of the 
slightly-more-punk yet slightly-
less-everything-else fashion of 
the nineties. It’s probable. But 
perhaps it stood for something 
more, a form of release for a 
nation in grieving. The early 
aughts of America were the 
perfect breeding ground for a 
strange form of nuanced sadness, 
one that still perpetrates our 
lives today. It cannot be a 
coincidence that some of the 
most 
iconic 
movies, 
books 

and clothing trends American 
popular culture has ever set 
forth came to light in a time 
of tragedy. I’m not saying that 
nationalism was on the forefront 
of every woman’s mind when 
she put on a tie-dye poncho, but 
there may have been something 
subconscious involved, a desire 
bubbling beneath that crocheted 
surface.

As is historically the case, 

this Western-derived movement 
rippled across the world in no 
time. In 2002, Versace debuted 
a couture collection full of 
gem-covered gowns in hues of 
lime green, hot pink and, on 
several occasions, rainbow. At 
the same time, commonplace 
stores 
like 
Target 
boasted 

brightly 
patterned 
dresses 

that 
were 
supposed 
to 
be 

worn over leggings. By 2005, 
nearly everyone in the clothing 
industry had both feet in the 
fun-loving 
bandwagon, 
from 

high-end designers to bargain 
brands. Even Abercrombie, the 
most subdued (and overpriced) 
of every mall’s mega-retailers, 
offered up their fair share of 
bubble skirts and lace-trimmed 
camis (both of which were, 
indeed, overpriced).

We 
can’t 
talk 
2000s-era 

fashion without making mention 
of celebrity clothing lines. Jay 
Z and Damon Dash’s Rocawear, 
Avril Lavigne’s Abbey Dawn, 
Miley Cyrus’s collaboration with 

Max Azria for Walmart. For 
many of the decade’s rich and 
famous, the notion of creating 
a personal brand appeared to 
mean more than the clothes 
themselves. In other words, 
we may never have seen Miley 
wearing 
the 
cheetah 
print 

pants from her own collection, 
but it didn’t matter. The charm 
brought about by a big name, 
coupled with an adherence to 
the style of the decade, was 
enough 
to 
make 
celebrity-

curated clothes a “thing” for a 
brief moment in time.

But why should we care about 

any of this in 2016? We have 
iPhones and a celebrity as our 
president-elect. Why does it 
matter what we were doing ten 
years ago?

It’s common knowledge that 

the trends of the past shape what 
we wear in the present, so it only 
makes sense that elements of ’00s 
fashion have made a resurgence. 
I was going to say that they “have 
come back to haunt us,” but I 
am wearing a tattoo choker as I 
write this, so I’m not one to talk. 
All kidding aside, look around. 
Tracksuits are back for both 
men and women. “Bellybutton 
shirts” have been reincarnated 
in through the modern crop top. 
Rapper Tyler, The Creator is at 
the helm of a successful, color-
happy clothing label, Golf Wang. 
I don’t speak French, but I can 
confidently say that 2016 has 
given me a sense of fashion déjà 
vu that I have yet to experience 
at any other time.

No, Kendall Jenner’s 21st 

birthday 
number 
was 
not 

groundbreaking. 
It 
was 
a 

friendly reminder of fashion’s 
blinged-out, bubbly past, one 
that we so often forget in lieu of 
the stone-cold seriousness that 
plagues the industry today.

I hope Paris Hilton is still 

laughing. 
Her 
Cavalli-meets-

Juicy Couture sense of style once 
meant the world to an entire 
industry. Who knows? Perhaps 
this form of fashion will come 
back in full force, hair crimped, 
denim miniskirt riding up just a 
bit too high.

Thank you, 2006. I’m sure we 

haven’t seen the last of you.

An ode to the fashion of the aughts 

Remembering a time where Paris Hilton and Pictochat reigned

Thrillers have one job, and it’s 

in the name: they need to thrill 
their 
audience. 
Everything, 

be it the performances, the 

direction or the editing, is 
in the service of aiding and 
abetting the adrenaline junkies 
in the theater in getting their 
high. When it works, as it did 
with last year’s spectacularly 
unnerving “The Gift,” the result 
is a movie that stays with the 

viewer long after the credits 
have rolled. When it doesn’t, as 
is the unfortunate case of “Shut 
In,” the outcome is nothing 
more than an hour and a half of 
wasted time.

The premise, to be fair, is 

an innately creepy one. Mary 

JEREMIAH VANDERHELM

Cheap jump scares ruin the potential 
of vaguely scary thriller ‘Shut In’

Disappointing ghost story starring Naomi Watts is no ‘The Ring’

(Naomi Watts, “King Kong”) 
is a child psychologist who 
has to split her time between 
her practice and caring for her 
catatonic son, Stephen (Charlie 
Heaton, “Stranger 
Things”). After a 
young boy (Jacob 
Tremblay, “Room”) 
goes missing and 
is presumed dead, 
she begins to think 
that his spirit is 
haunting her. As 
a massive winter 
storm bears down 
on them, Mary and the spirit 
— or whatever is causing the 
disturbances — are trapped 
indoors.

That synopsis has a few things 

going for it: a claustrophobic 
setting, a fear of the unknown 
and a bit of a man (or woman, 
as the case may be) vs. nature 
theme. Somewhat stunningly, 
director 
Farren 
Blackburn 

(“Marvel’s 
Daredevil”) 

manages to take that promise 
and do absolutely nothing with 
it, instead choosing to focus 
on the same hackneyed jump 
scares that plague every two-bit 
horror or thriller flick.

Mary 
hears 
something 

outside. A raccoon jumps out 
at her. She hears something 
upstairs. The kindly gentleman 
who has taken a liking to her 

jumps out at her, as one does. 
Something supernatural jumps 
out at her. It’s a dream. It’s the 
same fake-out nonsense that 
has become the bane of these 

types of movies, 
put in by writers 
who have realized 
that they don’t 
have 
anything 

interesting 
in 

their 
film 
to 

keep 
audiences 

invested.

“Shut In” fits 

that 
profile 
to 

a T. The constant fake-out 
jump scares are tedious, but 
at least predicting how the 
overwrought 
build-up 
will 

amount to nothing can become 
a game in and of itself. Beyond 
that, the movie offers nothing. 
The performances, beyond a 
sadly 
underused 
Tremblay, 

range between disinterested 
and hammy to the point of 
hilarity. 
After 
the 
initial 

eeriness of the premise wears 
itself out, there’s no tension 
at all, just scene after scene of 
jump scares and Mary worrying 
about jump scares.

With all that in mind, the 

first two acts of “Shut In” are 
bad, but they’re forgettably bad. 
They’re inoffensively bad, more 
flat-out boring than anything 
else. Then the third act begins, 

and it begins with a twist 
so ill-advised and laughably 
ridiculous that it genuinely 
boggles the mind. There’s no 
build-up to it, no foreshadowing. 
It’s just a sudden left turn for the 
story to take for no other reason 
than, “Hey, other thrillers have 
twists. We should have a twist, 
too.”

What follows is a solid five 

minutes of exposition, so the 
audience 
understands 
that 

the subject of this twist is 
singlehandedly 
responsible 

for everything bad that has 
happened in the movie. What it 
amounts to is an extended game 
of hide-and-seek, with Mary 
hiding in a closet for what feels 
like a small eternity. Once again, 
there’s no tension, because 
not only does the audience 
not care about the characters, 
they’re still recovering from the 
hilarious shock to the system 
that was that twist.

“Shut In” could have been a 

tense, claustrophobic thriller 
with a talented cast. Instead, it 
never fails to treat itself with the 
utmost seriousness, even in its 
silliest moments, and it settles 
for something lesser. It’s boring 
and lazy in its storytelling, and 
outside of some genuinely well-
shot moments, there’s little 
above average or even plainly 
average to the rest of it.

Actually, the ‘Shrek’ soundtrack is his lasting legacy.

A cult-favorite poet from 

Quebec 
who 
wrote 
the 

most 
ubiquitous 
song 
of 

his 
generation, 
who 
didn’t 

command the largest audiences 
of his career until he was in his 
70s, who had limited vocal range 
but an endless vocabulary — 
Leonard Cohen looms as such a 
large figure in music because he 
never followed expectations or 
conventional wisdom, building 
the kind of career and biography 
that will never be replicated. 
His acclaimed catalog of music 
and writing, coupled with that 
transfixing voice, strong sense of 
style and Zen disposition, make 
you want to hang onto his every 
word, to try and use all he says a 
guide for living. He’s a musician 
second and a philosopher — 
lover of wisdom — first.

Songs of Leonard Cohen, 

the singer-songwriter’s nearly 
50-year-old debut record, still 
holds up as perhaps his most 
essential work. It’s not the 
album with “Hallelujah,” but it 
contains many of Cohen’s most 
beloved and oft-covered songs. 
It’s an ideal entry point into 
a lengthy, impressive career 
that never followed any kind 
of straightforward path. It was 
released in the ’60s, when folk 
music dominated the charts, but 
even now that its style feels of a 
different era, the idiosyncratic 
work of Songs remains an 
important, easy-to-obsess-over 
work of art.

Cohen announced himself 

in the most unbelievable way 
with “Suzanne,” the immortal 
opening track of Songs. The song 
is an out-of-body experience, as 
Cohen narrates an encounter 
by a river with a dream-like 
vision of a woman, with whom 
he draws explicit parallels to 

Jesus Christ. It’s barely a pop 
song, but rather a search for 
enlightenment — one man trying 
to understand life with just an 
acoustic guitar and a desire for 
connection.

Cohen positions himself as 

an old-school troubadour on 
Songs, a timeless artist looking 
for meaning through his muses 
and stories. Many of these tracks 
are about people he has crossed 
paths with, especially women 
who have inspired him, and 
they’re all poetic ballads and 
epics in the folk and storytelling 
tradition. “Suzanne” may as 
well be Athena. “Marianne” 
is Eurydice. These songs are 
worldly, detailed and multi-
faceted 
— 
understandable, 

considering Cohen was already 
an accomplished writer before 
his music career and didn’t 
release this album until he was 
33.

Unlike 
many 
other 
folk 

singers of his era, Leonard 
Cohen was never known for 
acidic wit or complexly funny 
turns of phrase, and he stays 
remarkably 
clear-headed 

throughout Songs. While Dylan 
would tell a departing lover, 
“You just kind of wasted my 
precious time,” Cohen offers 
only, “Hey, that’s no way to say 
goodbye.” While Van Morrison 
would collapse into a puddle of 
ecstasy upon meeting a woman 
who seems like Jesus, Cohen 
stays calm, letting the listener 
absorb all he has to say without 
embellishment.

But despite Cohen’s quite-

earned reputation for deep-
thought 
seriousness, 
his 

warmth and sense of humor are 
consistently underrated. “Sisters 
of Mercy,” which closes side one, 
is one of the album’s true joys. 
Written about two hitchhikers 
Cohen 
met 
in 
Edmonton 

and scored with celebratory 
percussion, “Sisters” is a simple 

ode to human interaction and 
spontaneous gifts, as Cohen 
thanks the two women for 
inspiring this song. It’s music 
that shows how one can be 
occupied with the meaning 
of life while still appreciating 
the everyday wonders. A lot of 
people characterize Leonard 
Cohen 
as 
“depressing,” 
but 

that deep voice belies a warm 
romantic, one who’s always 
hopeful for a better world even 
in his lowest moments.

Undeniably, Cohen’s legacy 

will be “Hallelujah” in the way 
Frost’s is “The Road Not Taken” 
and Da Vinci’s is the Mona 
Lisa. It’s a brilliant piece of art 
that has earned an unlikely 
place in the mainstream public 
consciousness. For as long as 
people sing, that song — in forms 
both transcendent and awful — 
will always be.

But it’s more than worth it to 

explore Leonard Cohen beyond 
just “Hallelujah.” As Songs of 
Leonard Cohen and his entire 
body of work demonstrates, he 
was an immensely intelligent 
artist 
with 
empathy 
for 

everyone. To listen to Leonard 
Cohen sing in that uniquely 
transfixing voice was to learn 
and to live, to dream of and to 
believe in a vision of the world 
only someone as strange and 
thoughtful and beautiful as him 
could truly understand.

Goodbyes 
and 
hellos, 

adventures and failures, the 
holy and the broken — he 
sang about them all. Leonard 
Cohen helped put us in better 
touch with the world, and he 
connected his listeners to the 
wonders of living. Cohen could 
take emotions that you couldn’t 
quite describe yourself and 
spin them into grand tales that 
explored the mysteries of love 
and life while never losing touch 
with the basic humanity these 
feelings came from.

Cohen by his debut album

Brady Hoke always wanted

John O’Korn ran up behind 

De’Veon Smith and lifted him 
up.

The senior running back 

had just powered in his second 
touchdown of the game to put 
No. 3 Michigan up 20-10 over 
the Hoosiers. It was a moment 
of relief for the Wolverines, 
who had trailed for most of the 
contest.

O’Korn struggled throughout 

his first start at Michigan, but 
one thing always seemed to work: 
handing off the ball to Smith. 
So now, after Smith seemed to 
will the Wolverines to a major 
lead that they would ultimately 
maintain, the redshirt junior 
quarterback raised up the player 

who put the team on his back.

The running back accrued 

158 yards for two touchdowns, 
saving his longest run for 
his 39-yard score in the final 
seconds of the third quarter. He 
averaged 6.9 yards per carry, 
and instead of running backs 
coach Tyrone Wheatley steadily 
rotating Michigan’s four leading 
running backs like usual, Smith 
was given the ball over and over 
again for good reason.

“Yeah, I mean, (Smith was) 

grinding out first downs,” said 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh. 
“De’Veon, he played with great 
motivation and some great play 
by the offensive line. It felt like 
old-fashioned, slobber-knocker 
football … 

“De’Veon breaking tackles 

— even the hard runs, the yards 

after contact, pushing for the 
first down was critical.”

Though Smith’s heroics were 

more visible in the second half, 
he was a major contributor in 
the first as well. He broke loose 
for a 25-yard run on 4th-and-2 
in the second quarter to set up 
for the Wolverines’ first score 
of the game, a 28-yard field goal 
made by fifth-year senior kicker 
Kenny Allen.

“You know, it was a very 

important game for us seniors, 
and I believe our team wanted 
to go out with a bang, and that’s 
what we did,” Smith said. “We 
weren’t getting it done in the first 
quarter. We were getting three-
and-outs on offense and defense 
was still sticking in there for us, 
but we wanted to go out with a 
bang and that’s what we did.”

Smith credited the offensive 

line for his success, and that 
humility is what redshirt junior 
linebacker Mike McCray thinks 
makes him so good. 

“He works hard, probably 

more than anybody on the 
team,” McCray said, “and he 
has the heart to get the extra 
yards that he wants to get and 
what we need.”

On Senior Day, Smith showed 

some of that heart when he 
refused to go down, bowling 
over an Indiana defender on that 
25-yard run on fourth down. 
Moments like this are what 
make fifth-year senior defensive 
tackle Ryan Glasgow call him an 
“absolute animal.”

I

ndiana called a timeout, and 
then De’Veon Smith picked up 
the first down, and then the 

chant started 
in earnest.

In the 

previous few 
minutes, there 
had been 
murmurs of 
it, as if those 
remaining 
from an 
announced 
crowd of 
110,288 had 
been waiting to start it. Then, 
with just under four minutes to 
play, with the No. 3 Michigan 
football team in possession and 
the game finally in hand, it came 
out in full force:

BEAT O-HI-O.
As the Wolverines ran out the 

clock on a 20-10 victory against 
Indiana on Saturday at Michigan 
Stadium, the chant rumbled 
throughout the building. It 
continued after the clock ran out 
and the Michigan Marching Band 
played “The Victors.” It echoed 
through the concourse as the fans 
filed out of the bowl. It may well 
echo around the state all week.

The chant was “BEAT 

O-HI-O.” It was not “BEAT THE 
BUCK-EYES,” the more common 
call before Jan. 12, 2011. That 
day, Michigan introduced its new 
head football coach, a man named 
Brady Hoke.

Hoke put the Michigan-Ohio 

State rivalry on a pedestal. He 
refused to wear red. He wanted to 
win this game more than any of 
the others. He called the Buckeyes 
“Ohio” as a slight, which is how 
the chant started.

As Jim Harbaugh leads the 

Wolverines near the pinnacle of 
the college football world, those in 
the fan base try to erase memories 
from the painful years that came 
before. That will be hard to do this 
week. Though most of Hoke’s staff 

is gone, most of Michigan’s players 
are his recruits — and “The Game” 
is the biggest game in college 
football this week, just like Hoke 
always wanted.

Much has changed around 

Ann Arbor since Hoke resigned 
and Harbaugh arrived. 
Harbaugh religiously avoids 
placing more significance on 
one game than another. If his 
team does so, he reasons, then 
it didn’t give its best effort in all 
of the games — an unpardonable 
sin in Harbaugh’s book. The 
next game, he repeats, is the 
most important one.

Brady Hoke made no such 

stipulation.

“(Ohio State) is the most 

important game on that 
schedule, and not that the 
others aren’t important, but it 

is the most. Important. Game. 
On. That. Schedule,” Hoke 
said at his introductory press 
conference, pounding the 
podium for emphasis. “… It’s 
very important to me, and very 
… it’s almost personal.”

Hoke’s four years as head coach 

will always be a sore spot because 
of his record, especially compared 
to his successor. But Hoke was, by 
all accounts, a good man whose 
players loved him. He just didn’t 
win nearly enough football games.

He did, however, get his team 

ready for Ohio State. In four 
editions of the most important 
game on Hoke’s schedule, 
Michigan played some of its best 
football in all of them, winning 
one and making the other three far 
closer than they should have been.

Hoke also put his fingerprints 

all over this year’s team, and for 
that Harbaugh owes him a great 
deal. He recruited Michigan’s 
entire starting defense, from fifth-
year seniors Chris Wormley and 
Ryan Glasgow on the line to senior 
cornerbacks Jourdan Lewis and 
Channing Stribling at the back end 
to, yes, even redshirt sophomore 
Jabrill Peppers.

He brought in starting 

quarterback Wilton Speight, even 
after other schools shied away 
from Speight following an injury 
in high school. He signed all 
three of Michigan’s top receivers 
and laid the foundation for an 
offensive line that now starts 
three fifth-year seniors.

And as much as the program 

is different now than it was 
two years ago, parts of Hoke’s 
culture remain. Fifth-year 

senior Ryan Glasgow, whom 
Hoke brought in as a walk-on 
before he blossomed into one 
of the defense’s most important 
players, said after Saturday’s 
game there was “no doubt” that 
this weekend’s showdown is the 
biggest of his career.

“Ohio State, Michigan, greatest 

rivalry in sports — how can it not 
be in the back of your mind from 
right after the day you play it until 
the next year?” Glasgow said. “I 
don’t really hesitate to say that it’s 
probably the biggest game that you 
play in every year — all dependent 
on what rankings are and what 
position you’re in, but it’s always in 
the back of your mind.”

In the final minutes Saturday, 

Glasgow couldn’t help but hear the 
“BEAT O-HI-O” chants coming 
from the stands. How could he 

not? The passion and sentiment 
Hoke instilled didn’t leave when 
he did.

“Great guy, great mentor,” 

Glasgow said. “I still check in 
with him every now and then. 
Personally, I owe a lot to that guy. 
Believed in me from the beginning. 
As an unrecruited walk-on, 
sometimes that doesn’t happen.”

Harbaugh, meanwhile, 

preaches the importance of 
treating every game like a 
championship game, and it 
doesn’t hurt that this really is 
one. If Michigan wins Saturday, it 
will win the Big Ten East division 
and advance to the Big Ten 
Championship on Dec. 3.

That only adds to the usual 

storylines. Each team has plenty 
of players from the other state, 
including both starting running 
backs (Michigan’s De’Veon Smith 
is from Warren, Ohio, while Ohio 
State’s Mike Weber hails from 
Detroit). Each team is ranked in 
the top three heading into the 
matchup for the second time ever.

“I don’t need to say too much 

about the game — it’s just the 
game,” Peppers said. “Now that 
it’s finally here, we can zero in on 
it and put all our focus towards 
it, ’cause this one’s for all the 
marbles. Everything we want is 
right in front of us. We just gotta 
go out there and execute.”

No longer do Michigan and 

Ohio State have to downplay this 
weekend’s showdown to avoid 
getting ahead of themselves. 
Regardless of which coach is 
at the helm, the game Saturday 
is the biggest of the season. 
Hoke and most of the rest of the 
country treat it that way because 
it’s “The Game.” Jim Harbaugh 
and his team do because it’s the 
next game. This week, it just so 
happens to be both.

Former Michigan coach Brady Hoke never got his team to the level he wanted, but his fingerprints are all over this year’s team as it heads into “The Game.”

Glasgow said. “I think me and 
Chris had him on a running back 
draw, and we were sure to take 
him down, and he kept his legs 

moving, and we got back to the 
line of scrimmage and we were 
like, ‘This kid is a horse.’ This kid 
just doesn’t stop, he’s relentless, 
so that’s always awesome to have 
in a running back.” 

After snow angels were made 

and all of the fun in Michigan’s

been had, redshirt sophomore 
linebacker Jabrill Peppers pulled 
Smith’s chair out for him in post-
game media availability.

Peppers took it a step further 

and uncapped Smith’s Gatorade 
for him, too.

It’s safe to say that Smith had 

earned it.

chances to put away an inferior 
team on their home field. They 
know they could have lost their 
fourth straight Senior Day game. 
They’ve done it all before.

They played better, but did not 

manage to survive, in last year’s 
heartbreaker against Michigan 
State. They did the same in their 
home finale in 2013 against a 
much better Ohio State team. In 
between, they suffered losses of 
every form.

The Minnesota game in 

2014 brought the Shane Morris 
concussion incident, to say 
nothing of the fact that the 
Golden Gophers came into 
the Big House, dominated the 
Wolverines and stole the Little 
Brown Jug off their sideline. 
Utah stomped Michigan until 
a downpour halted play, then 
stayed in the stadium and 
finished it off with only Utes 
fans in the building. Maryland 
spoiled the Wolverines’ Senior 
Day, all but extinguishing their 
bowl hopes with a trip to Ohio 
State coming the following week.

This year’s seniors remember 

all of that. Perhaps that was 
part of the emotion of this 
year’s Senior Day. Defensive 
tackle Ryan Glasgow finished 
the live portion of warmups to 
see his parents standing on the 
sideline, holding a frame with 
his jersey in it. Thomas, Hill 
and cornerback Jourdan Lewis 
shared a moment before they 
ran out of the tunnel for the 
final time.

“Before the game, we were 

all like, ‘I can’t believe we’re 
touching the banner one last 
time,’ ” Thomas said. “We all 
came in together, we all grinded 
together and now we’re all 
leaving together, except for a few 
guys who transferred.

“When they started playing 

that video, when they started 
playing that sad music, Khalid 
comes to me, he’s like, ‘I might 
start crying.’ I’m like, ‘If you 
cry, I’m gonna cry.’ And (Lewis) 
is like, ‘No, what’s wrong with 
y’all? Y’all got a game! Let’s go 
win!’ And then (Lewis) is like, 
‘You know, I might cry too, y’all.’ 
I was like, ‘We’re gonna be all 
right. Let’s just go win, and let’s 
make the best of this last year we 
got together.’ ”

Almost four hours later, with 

their final home win safely in 
tow, they celebrated. Morris, 
Jake Butt, Henry Poggi, Patrick 
Kugler and Ben Gedeon — all 
seniors who have gone through 
various forms of adversity in 
their own individual careers — 
took a picture together. Offensive 
lineman Kyle Kalis, in his own 
inimitable style, waved his arms 
frantically to pump up the crowd. 
Glasgow, for the first time in his 
career, ran to the student section 
and jumped on the wall — before 
he realized he was jumping in the 
wrong section.

It was one of Michigan’s 

least impressive victories of the 
season, yet it may have been the 
one most worth celebrating. 
The Wolverines are 10-1 and are 
heading down to Columbus next 
week for a showdown against 
Ohio State because they did what 
it took to win Saturday.

They managed just 59 

passing yards, their lowest total 
of the season. They had the 
same number of first downs as 
Indiana, 15. They outgained the 
Hoosiers by just 29. Only a pair 
of De’Veon Smith touchdown 
runs late in the third quarter 
secured the win.

But they did secure the 

win. These seniors don’t 
take that for granted — and 
neither does their head coach. 
In 1986, quarterbacking a 
then-undefeated Michigan 

team, Jim Harbaugh lost the 
last game he ever played at 
Michigan Stadium, 20-17 
against Minnesota.

“It’s not a good feeling,” 

Harbaugh said Saturday of 
losing his home finale. “At all. 
I’m glad our guys played eight 
home games and won ’em all.

“The constant, being a 

Michigan football player 
through the ages, is that you 
play in the Michigan Stadium. 
You play in that venue, that 
Big House. Always has been 
that way, is and always will be. 
That’s the one constant — all the 
time, the facilities, the changes, 
society and everything else — is 
that you play in that stadium.”

It hasn’t always gone 

smoothly here, and it didn’t 
Saturday, perhaps a fitting end 
to the seniors’ careers. Michigan 
trailed at halftime for the 
first time all season, and with 
starting quarterback Wilton 
Speight injured on the sideline, 
uneasiness spread among the 
announced crowd of 110,288. 
About a third of the student 
section emptied out at halftime.

Those who remained at the 

end had the opportunity to 
savor the feeling. By then, the 
snow had blown around the 
stadium and coated the turf. 
The cheerleaders made snow 
angels in the end zones, and the 
students threw snowballs on the 
field. “Let It Snow” played over 
the speakers.

With an eighth straight 

home win this year, the 
Wolverines added another 
lasting memory to erase all 
of the sour ones. Afterward, 
Harbaugh, who has won 78 
games as a college head coach 
and reached the Super Bowl, 
called it “one of the best wins 
I’ve ever been involved with.”

Because, as the Wolverines 

found out Saturday, that’s how it 
feels to survive.

O’Korn’s run salvages shaky day

Football games rarely actually 

depend on one play, but Saturday 
night, one run certainly seemed 
to swing the outcome.

With the Michigan football 

team trailing Indiana, 10-6, late 
in the third quarter, redshirt 
junior quarterback John O’Korn 
was struggling. All game long, 
O’Korn had been under pressure, 
and most of the time, it didn’t 
end well. He was sacked twice, 
hurried twice and tackled for loss 
on another play.

His feet have been considered 

an asset off the Wolverines’ 
bench, 
so 
when 
starting 

quarterback 
Wilton 
Speight 

went down with an injury last 
week, it was widely expected he 
would showcase them early and 
often. It just hadn’t been working 
out that way. As the game wore 
on, O’Korn said, passing game 
coordinator Jedd Fisch told him 
over the phone, “You need to 
make a play.” He did.

Moving to his left, O’Korn 

took off scrambling, turned the 
corner and started up field. It 
didn’t appear to be a designed 
run like other times Saturday, 
but he found a hole regardless. 
Fifth-year senior receiver Jehu 
Chesson sealed a great block 
outside, and O’Korn shot through 
the lane. As he crossed midfield, 
it looked like he had all kinds of 
space to keep going.

“I thought I was going to 

score,” he said. “Got tackled 
from behind.”

Though he was stopped at the 

34-yard line, it was enough to 
kick-start the Michigan offense. 
Senior running back De’Veon 
Smith trucked a Hoosier defender 
and scored on the next play. 
Smith then added a 39-yard score 
on the next drive, and that was 
all the offense the Wolverines 
would need.

Prior to O’Korn’s run, the 

Wolverines 
were 
sputtering. 

They had just 166 total yards of 
offense, and even with another 
strong 
showing 
from 
their 

defense, six points wouldn’t 
have been enough. They were 
the beneficiaries of great field 

position for most of the game, 
but with O’Korn starting his first 
game in two years, the offense 
lacked direction, creativity and, 
until his long run, production.

“When John took off for that 

run, that’s what really sparked 
us,” Smith said. “That really is 
what got the offensive line going. 
It’s not like I had the whole game 
in control. The defense was 
definitely in control — they were 
making stops and putting us back 
on the field. We were just making 
plays as an offense.”

O’Korn said he knew Sunday 

afternoon that he would start 
for Speight, and even though 
no team likes to lose its starting 
quarterback with two weeks left 
in the regular season, there was 
reason for confidence around 
Schembechler 
Hall. 
O’Korn 

had started for a season and a 
half at Houston, and all spring 
and summer he was said to be 
in a heated competition for the 
starting quarterback job.

But that optimism seemed 

misplaced early. Partly due to 
heavy pressure from the Hoosiers 
and partly due to an apparent 
tendency to leave the pocket, 

O’Korn mustered just 59 total 
passing yards. He was 7-for-18 
on the day, with no touchdowns 
or interceptions, but thanks to a 
bruising game from Smith, that 
was enough.

Michigan 
coach 
Jim 

Harbaugh 
said 
O’Korn 
“did 

a lot of good things” against 
Indiana, but he also said that 
Speight could potentially return 
for next week’s tilt against Ohio 
State. If the Wolverines win that 
one, they will earn a spot in the 
Big Ten Championship Game 
and have an inside track to the 
College Football Playoff.

To beat the second-ranked 

Buckeyes, though, Michigan will 
need some kind of improvement 
under center. Ohio State is an 
entirely different beast than 
Indiana, and the Buckeyes are 
talented enough to bring even 
more pressure than O’Korn saw 
Saturday. So even as Harbaugh 
and 
his 
players 
expressed 

their pleasure with O’Korn’s 
performance, a nugget of truth 
came from the man himself.

“Luckily,” he said, “our run 

game and our O-line had my 
back today.”

‘M’ captures 2K Classic title

NEW YORK CITY — For the 

past two seasons, the Michigan 
men’s basketball team has been 
thoroughly 
manhandled 
by Southern 
Methodist.

Last 
season 
in 
Dallas, 

the Mustangs (3-1) held the 
Wolverines scoreless for the last 
10 minutes of play to win, 82-58. 
The year before that, SMU won 
handily by 24 points.

But Friday night at Madison 

Square 
Garden, 
it 
was 
a 

completely different storyline.

Michigan (4-0) flipped the 

script from the past two seasons 
and came out strong, running 
up a 15-point lead with 3:43 left 
in the first half. The Wolverines 
never gave up that lead en route 
to a 76-54 win and a 2K Classic 
championship.

“The last loss to SMU, we got 

punked throughout the whole 
game,” said senior guard Zak 
Irvin. “We didn’t want that to 
happen this game, and we came 
out with a chip on our shoulder.”

Almost a carbon copy of 

Thursday night’s game against 
Marquette, Michigan came out 
swinging in all facets of the 
game in the first half.

Senior guard Derrick Walton 

Jr. came out on fire, starting 
the game with three made 
3-pointers in a row. Walton 
finished with 23 points to lead 
all scorers after not scoring at 
all against the Golden Eagles the 
night before.

“It was good to see (Walton) 

come 
out 
and 
play,” 
said 

Michigan coach John Beilein 
“He can be an elite shooter, and 
we’ve seen that. We try to create 
opportunities for him as well as 
(let him) lead the floor.”

Overall, 
Michigan 
shot 
a 

whopping 
57.1 
percent 
(16-

for-28) in the first half. The 
Wolverines continued the hot 

shooting into the second half 
and finished the game 27-for-51.

In 
the 
paint, 
sophomore 

forward Moritz Wagner and 
senior forward Mark Donnal 
produced a combined 12 points 
and 7 rebounds in the first 
half. Even more 
impressive, 
the 

duo held SMU 
forward 
and 

Duke 
transfer 

Semi Ojeleye to 
just 13 points, a 
far cry from the 
22.7 that he had 
averaged in the 
first three games 
of the season.

“(Michigan) 

did 
a 
really 

good job of taking us out of our 
rhythm,” said SMU coach Tim 
Jankovich. “I give them some 
credit, they took us out of some 
things, and we didn’t really 
handle it like we needed to.”

Added 
Irvin: 
“We 
know 

(Ojeleye) is a great player. We 
knew he was going to come 
out aggressive, so it was a good 
matchup with (Wilson), credit 
to DJ.”

Redshirt 
sophomore 
DJ 

Wilson, in his second start 

of the season, 
wasn’t able to 
replicate 
his 

10-plus rebound 
stat 
from 
the 

first three games 
of the season, 
but he had a 
respectable 
six points and 
four boards in 
39 
minutes 
of 

action.

On the other 

end of the court, the Wolverines’ 
aggressive defense held a team 
that had averaged just under 40 
points a half to 26 in the first 
half as Michigan went into the 
break up 19.

“We took pride in guarding 

our man,” Irvin said. “It was 
huge for us, and especially in the 
first half, we held SMU to two 
offensive rebounds.”

In the second half, SMU’s 

offense did a much better job in 
its half-court offense setting, 
but Michigan’s offense was up to 
the task. The two teams traded 
buckets for the first five minutes, 
but the Wolverines’ attack was 
too much for the Mustangs, and 
Michigan’s defense stayed steady 
and ran away with the game.

Many pundits labeled the 

Wolverines’ trip to New York as 
their first real test of the season. 
Leaving Madison Square Garden 
with two dominant wins, it’s 
safe to say Michigan passed 
with flying colors.

“We’re playing with a lot 

of confidence,” Donnal said. 
“Every single year, we’ve had 
these preseason tournaments, I 
think this is the first year we’ve 
actually won one. It says a lot 
about this group to start off 4-0.”

to SMU, we 

got punked the 
whole game.”

MEN’S BASKETBALL
This Friday night
N

EW YORK CITY — The 
buzzer sounded, the 
celebration was modest 

and the 
theatrics 
were few.

Sure, the 

Wolverines 
got to stand 
behind a 
banner that 
dubbed 
them the 
champions 
of the 
2K Classic at the center of 
Madison Square Garden. And 
yes, senior guard Derrick 
Walton Jr. got to hold his 
team’s new trophy as pictures 
were taken to commemorate 
the moment.

There was no confetti. There 

weren’t fans storming the court. 
This wasn’t one shining moment 
— and we still don’t know if 
Michigan will even come close to 
having one.

In fact, there are a lot of things 

we still don’t know about the 
Wolverines.

Are they going to live and 

die by the 3? Is this new 
defense under assistant coach 
Billy Donlon sustainable? 
When are the freshmen 
going to make the impact 
Michigan coach John Beilein is 
expecting? Can they really stay 
healthy for a whole season?

Still, for 40 minutes Friday 

night, in the mecca of basketball, 
Michigan threw those doubts 
out the window. For 40 minutes, 
it imposed its will against 
Southern Methodist to the tune 
of a 22-point victory. And that’s a 
damn good start.

The Wolverines entered 

Friday night having played their 
best half of the season against 
Marquette, eventually beating the 
Golden Eagles by 18.

But the Mustangs were a whole 

different monster. It seemed no 
half of basketball could have been 
good enough for Michigan to 

forget recent history.

In 2014, SMU went onto the 

Wolverines’ home floor, poured on 
17 unanswered points in the last 
10 minutes and walked away from 
Crisler Center with a 62-51 victory.

And last season, the 

Mustangs didn’t just beat 
Michigan. They flat-out 
embarrassed the Wolverines.

Michigan traveled to Dallas, 

only to get outrebounded by 
25, lose by 24 and let SMU turn 
the game into a one-sided dunk 
contest.

But this Friday night, for the 

first time in a long time, it felt 
like the Wolverines had their 
swagger back.

This Friday night, redshirt 

sophomore forward DJ Wilson 
wasn’t just dunking. He was 
rocking the rim and then 
strutting the baseline as if to tell 
the fans he’d be doing it all night.

This Friday night, the college 

3-point line wasn’t quite difficult 
enough, as the Wolverines pulled 
up from NBA range time and 
time again.

And when they made it, they 

let SMU know.

With under a minute left to 

play in the first half, junior guard 
Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman 
connected from deep. Then he let 
his hand stay in the air for just a 
few seconds extra.

This Friday night, Michigan 

boarded a plane with a trophy 
in tow.

There’s no telling if this is 

the preview of things to come. 
Entering the season, there was 
a sentiment that the Wolverines 
had the pieces for success in 
place. But those also came with 
the same doubts that will still 
exist tomorrow.

Yet this Friday night, Michigan 

put its pieces together. It did so 
against a team that has owned the 
matchup the past two years. And 
it happened in the World’s Most 
Famous Arena.

Doubts or not, that’s a hell of 

a start.

‘M’ tops USNTDP, 6-3

In its first action of the season, 

the Michigan hockey team played 
Windsor in a preseason game 
before beginning its regular slate. 
After a preseason filled with 
injury and uncertainty, freshman 
forward Nick Pastujov played for 
the first time against the Lancers, 
and with two minutes remaining 
in the first period, he scored 
the Wolverines’ first goal of the 
season on the power play.

Since that exhibition game, 

Pastujov had been held scoreless. 
Friday night, though, he found 
the net, and in an exhibition once 
again. With the game tied at two 
in the third period, freshman 
forward Steven Merl crossed 
the puck to the middle toward 
Pastujov, who knocked it past 
U.S. National Team Development 
Program goaltender and Michigan 
recruit Dylan St. Cyr for a 3-2 lead, 
one the 18th-ranked Wolverines 
would never relinquish, as they 
defeated the USNTDP at Yost Ice 
Arena, 6-3.

“I thought that this was far and 

away Nick Pastujov’s best of the 
game of the year,” said Michigan 
coach Red Berenson. “And it came 
at a good time.”

Two other Wolverine recruits 

played in the game for the 
USNTDP: center Josh Norris 
— a good friend of Michigan 
forward Will Lockwood — and 
defenseman Quinn Hughes.

“It was cool,” said freshman 

forward James Sanchez. “It was 
good to see what they got, and 
what they’re going to bring next 
year.”

For the first 10-plus minutes, 

the game moved rather slowly, 
with the teams nearly even 
in shots. Then with about six 
minutes remaining in the period, 
Lockwood earned a trip to the 
penalty box for hooking.

The Wolverines looked to kill 

the penalty as they cleared the 
puck to the opposite zone with 11 
seconds remaining on the power 
play.

Hughes skated toward the 

net and grabbed the puck before 
seeing a hole in the Michigan 

defense and passing the puck to 
a wide-open Jacob Tortora, who 
slapped it past senior goaltender 
Zach Nagelvoort. The USNTDP 
held onto that lead heading into 
the first intermission.

In 
the 
second, 
though, 

the Wolverines answered, as 
Lockwood struck to tie it at one.

“I thought we played well,” 

Pastujov said. “We were there 
last year, so we know no matter 
what the score is, we know they’re 
going to put up a fight ’til the end, 
and that’s what they did. I thought 
it was a good, high-paced, really 
smooth game.”

The 
USNTDP 
remained 

focused 
against 
its 
older 

opponents and continued to play 
aggressively throughout the game. 
With about a minute remaining 
in the second period, it pressed 
forward on offense. Norris skated 
to the Wolverines’ offensive zone 
and passed the puck across the 
ice to forward Brady Tkachuk. 
Tkachuk then hesitated, before 
feeding it to Tortora in the middle, 
who then backhanded it into the 
net to take the lead once again.

Michigan quickly responded 

and tied the game up about 
20 seconds later. Senior right 
wing Alex Kile zoomed to the 
USNTDP’s zone and fired a 
long pass to Luke Martin, who 
slapped the puck toward the goal. 
Fortunately for the Wolverines, 
freshman forward Adam Winborg 
managed to get his stick on it, 
tapping it in to tie the game at two.

It took until the third period for 

Michigan’s offense to really click. 
Two minutes after Pastujov’s 
early goal, Sanchez stole the puck 
in the corner of the USNTDP’s 
zone and deked out St. Cyr to 
make it a 4-3 game with his first 
goal of the third. His second came 
with five seconds remaining in the 
period. Kile added a goal off a pass 
from Winborg at the 15:59 mark.

“The game is on the line on the 

third,” Berenson said. “Tonight I 
didn’t think we got off to a good 
start. A week ago on Saturday 
we had a great first period, so-so 
second and not a good third. 
Tonight I thought our best period 
was the third. You want to be able 
to close out a game.”

ICE HOCKEY
Wolverines go on 52-0 run, beat Howard

Though 
the 
game 
was 

supposed to be a walk in the 
park, the Michigan women’s 
basketball team transformed 
it into a leisurely stroll on the 
beach — and made it into its top-
three scoring game of all time.

The 
Wolverines 
pounded 

Howard, 109-41, in the teams’ 
first-ever meeting Friday at 
Crisler Center. It was just the 
15th time in program history 
that Michigan has reached the 
triple-digit milestone — with the 
most recent being last weekend’s 
matchup with Niagara. This is 
the first time in school history 
that the team has gone three 
games in a row beating the 
century mark.

And a large chunk of that, 

expectedly, came from Katelynn 
Flaherty.

Before the first half was up, 

the junior guard tied her career 
high in assists at six. Flaherty 
went on to set her new record 
with a total of seven.

“For (Flaherty) to do that, it’s 

just like a typical day for her,” 
sophomore center Hallie Thome 
said. “She’s one of the most 
outstanding shooters we have 
and in the NCAA.”

Added 
Michigan 
coach 

Kim Barnes Arico: “She’s an 
incredible scorer. But when she 
finishes the night with (those 
statistics), she’s doing other 
things to help our team be 
successful. I think us having 32 
assists on the night shows our 
ability to be unselfish and our 
ability to make that extra pass 
and score the basketball.”

Barnes Arico chose to keep 

her starting lineup from the past 
two games: Thome, Flaherty, 
junior forward Jillian Dunston 
senior guards Siera Thompson 
and Danielle Williams.

The Bison started off with 

a quick 6-0 lead within the 
first minute — surprising the 
Wolverines, who have never 
trailed that much this season. 
But Flaherty, in the second 
minute of play, bumped the 
Wolverines up by three, quickly 
followed by another 3-pointer 
from Williams.

Thome pointed out that going 

forward it will be tougher to 
erase that deficit if the team 
trails that early, and by that 
margin, when facing future 
competition. 
To 
its 
credit, 

Michigan never let Howard take 
the lead again — or score another 
point in the first quarter. The 
Wolverines went on a 36-0 run 
for a final tally of 36-6.

The second quarter passed in 

much the same manner. By the 
end of the half, Flaherty led with 
17 points, and Gondzrezick and 
Thome followed her with 15 and 
12 points, respectively.

Michigan extended its run 

to 52-0 in the second quarter, 
but the streak broke with a pair 
of mid-range shots from the 
Bison around the four-minute 
mark. Barnes Arico said she 
didn’t even notice the streak, 
though, and only recognized the 
efficient play.

“I think it’s just exciting to 

see that we have a lot of people 
contributing to our (100-point 
streaks), and that’s exciting,” 

Thome said. “Any night can be 
anyone’s game.”

The 
Wolverines’ 
defense 

contributed to the standout 
performance with 16 steals for 
the night.

Thome set the mark with 

three turnovers. Dunston also 
was a force on the field and set 
the bar for rebounds, with a 
total of 13.

Barnes Arico also pointed 

out the all-around flexibility 
that sophomore guards Boogie 
Brozoski and Nicole Munger 
give the team. Combined, the 
two dished out 11 assists.

Freshmen were a large part 

of the depth on the team that 
Barnes Arico noted. Notably, it 
was freshman Kayla Robbins 
who made the breakaway layup 
to push the Wolverines over the 
99-point mark. It was guard 
KeAsja Peace who put Friday’s 
performance in a tie for the 
third-highest scoring game in 
program history. And it was 
guard Akenrieh Johnson who 
pushed the game over that mark.

Gondrezick 
finished 
the 

game with 22 points and went 
5-for-7 on 3-pointers, making 
her 
teammates 
notice 
the 

similarities between her and 
Flaherty.

“(Gondrezick) is hitting it 

lights out too,” Thome said. 
“Her and (Flaherty) on the court 
is something you just can’t mess 
with.”

Despite all the milestones in 

the game, Barnes Arico is still 
striving to tweak her team to get 
ready for heavier competition.

“Coaches 
are 
always 

pessimistic by nature,” Barnes 
Arico said. “I tell them to just 
take us on a run to the national 
championship 
and 
keep 
on 

taking those shots. I think our 
kids spend a lot of time in the 
gym and make an effort to be 
great shooters.

“It’s been really positive, but 

it’s important for us as coaches 
to keep everyone grounded. It 
was fun, let’s enjoy the moment, 
but tomorrow we get back to 
work.”

Five Things We Learned: Indiana

After 
redshirt 
sophomore 

quarterback 
Wilton 
Speight 

went down with a shoulder 
injury last week, the Michigan 
football team was already in for 
a challenge in its matchup with 
Indiana on Saturday.

A mid-game snow flurry, 

though, magnified the problem 
immensely. 
The 
Wolverines 

trailed at halftime, 7-3, before 
senior running back De’Veon 
Smith 
exploded 
for 
two 

touchdowns and helped them 
escape with a 20-10 victory.

Here’s what we learned from 

Michigan’s 10th victory of the 
season. (Or at least what we 
think we learned. The snow 
made it nearly impossible to see 
the field.)

1. It was unfair to expect no 

drop-off at the quarterback 
position.

After the news of Speight’s 

injury went public, his coaches 
and 
teammates 
expressed 

full confidence in his backup, 
redshirt junior John O’Korn. 
They pointed to his work ethic 
and steady focus, claiming they 
weren’t expecting much of a 
drop-off.

In hindsight, that probably 

wasn’t a fair assumption. O’Korn 
is a talented quarterback, but 
he hadn’t started in two years 
and didn’t have the 10 games 
of 
experience 
Speight 
had 

accumulated this season, and 
that showed on Saturday. O’Korn 
struggled throwing the ball — 
though the weather factor can’t 
be ignored — completing just 
seven of 16 passes for 59 yards.

He 
did 
spark 
the 
team 

with his feet, as a 30-yard 
run on 3rd-and-8 helped set 
up the Wolverines’ go-ahead 
touchdown. It was one of just 

three 
successful 
third-down 

conversions Michigan had all 
day.

2. De’Veon Smith deserves 

the trust his coaches have in 
him.

Some Wolverine fans seemed 

a bit perplexed after Smith 
received the bulk of the carries 
in last week’s loss to Iowa 
despite averaging just 2.3 yards 
a carry. Still, running backs 
coach Tyrone Wheatley made 
it clear this week that Smith is 
his most trusted back, citing his 
experience and development.

Smith didn’t wait long to 

validate 
his 
coach’s 
trust 

again, posting a career day 
Saturday with 158 yards and two 
touchdowns. His valiant effort 
in the third quarter proved to 
be the difference in the victory, 
swinging a 10-6 deficit into a 
20-10 lead that Michigan clung 
to for the rest of the game.

3. 
The 
Wolverines’ 

secondary isn’t invincible.

It’s still unwise to throw the 

ball near senior cornerbacks 
Jourdan Lewis and Channing 
Stribling — the two combined 
for four more pass breakups 
on Saturday and remain one of 
the top defensive back duos in 
the country. The Wolverines’ 

secondary allowed a few big 
plays through the air, though, 
allowing Indiana to temporarily 
seize control of the game.

In the second quarter, Hoosier 

receiver Luke Timian picked up a 
31-yard reception after Michigan 
senior safety Delano Hill fell 
down in coverage, setting up 
Indiana’s only touchdown of 
the game. Later, receiver Nick 
Westbrook made a great catch 
on a 37-yard gain despite tight 
coverage from Stribling, but 
Indiana had to settle for a field 
goal after the Wolverines picked 
up a stop on third down.

Michigan was fortunate that 

the Hoosiers failed to capitalize 
on their opportunities, but the 

Wolverines’ trend of allowing 
a few big plays per game could 
be problematic with No. 2 Ohio 
State looming next week.

4. Special teams can still 

make a difference.

Other 
than 
fifth-year 

senior kicker Kenny Allen’s 
rediscovered success, it had 
been a quiet few weeks for 
Michigan’s special teams unit. 
The Wolverines’ kick coverage 
squad got back to its old habit 
of blocking punts on Saturday, 
though, and that helped swing 
the momentum in Michigan’s 
favor.

First, it was fifth-year senior 

tight end Michael Jocz getting 
a hand on a punt in the second 
quarter, giving the Wolverines 
the ball in Indiana territory. 
They ended up kicking a field 
goal for the first points of the 
game. Later, it was freshman 
safety Khaleke Hudson who 
blocked another punt in the 
fourth quarter.

Michigan 
ultimately 

squandered the second scoring 
opportunity, but it benefited 
from great field position all 
afternoon. 
The 
Wolverines’ 

average starting position was at 
their own 39-yard line, while the 
Hoosiers’ was at their own 21 — 
thanks in large part to Allen, who 
had three 50-plus yard punts and 
four inside the 20-yard line.

5. 
BOLD 
PREDICTION: 

Michigan beats Ohio State.

Michigan may have looked 

sluggish the last two weeks, but 
“The Game” has a way of waking 
teams up quickly. Even in 2013 
and 2014, when the struggling 
Wolverines 
were 
essentially 

playing for nothing, they put 
a scare into the Buckeyes and 
threatened their national title 
hopes.

This year’s edition of the 

rivalry game has higher stakes 
than any year since 2006. 
The winner should be in the 
driver’s 
seat 
for 
a 
College 

Football Playoff berth, while 
the loser will likely be on the 
outside looking in. A surprise 
return from Speight would go 
a long way toward helping the 
Wolverines’ chances, but his 
status remains hush-hush.

Regardless, 
Michigan’s 

defense will be ready to go, and 
its offense could benefit from 
a contest with more stable 
weather conditions. It’s never 
easy to win in Columbus, but 
the Wolverines have more than 
a fighting chance.

Fifth-year senior kicker Kenny Allen has rebounded nicely since an apparent midseason slump. Allen had three punts of more than 50 yards on Saturday.

Finn, ‘M’ finish second in bittersweet end

Erin Finn thought she finally had 

it.

After passing Notre Dame’s Anna 

Rohrer in the final straightway, just 
200 meters separated Finn from 
Michigan’s first individual cross 
country 
national 
championship 

since Katie McGregor in 1998.

Despite the incredible nature 

of Finn’s career — which includes 
three Big Ten Athlete of the Year 
awards — it has been marked by 
misfortune, falling just short at 
the most inopportune times: she 
lost her shoe in the 2015 National 
Championship and injured her foot 
before the 1000-meter Olympic 
qualifiers 
last 
year. 
Saturday’s 

race, which took place on her 22nd 

birthday, provided an opportunity 
for the senior to finally capture the 
crown her career deserved.

“I thought that once I passed 

Anna Rohrer and made up that 
ground, I thought that the title 
might be mine,” Finn said, “I had 
no idea that Karissa Schweizer was 
coming behind me.”

Mere seconds away from the 

finish line, Finn turned her head 
to see Schweizer pass her. It was 
a bittersweet moment, as the 
Wolverines ran to a suprising 
second-place finish — good for 
Michigan’s best-ever result — just 
one point behind Oregon. But Finn 
fell just shy of the championship 
that has eluded her for so long.

“She did everything she could — 

similar to the team,” said Wolverine 
coach Mike McGuire. “She fought 

hard to get in the lead with about 
300 meters to go, but Schweitzer 
had a great kick at the end and was 
the better athlete today. She was the 
deserving champion today, and we 
tip our hat to her.”

Finn looked poised to capture a 

triumphant moment, running the 
6,000 meters in 19:44 — just 2.6 
seconds slower than Schweizer’s.

“Unfortunately, 
it 
wasn’t 

enough,” Finn said. “I thought it 
was, but I can rest in the fact that 
I could not have tried any harder 
or given it any more. But it was 
definitely a little heartbreaking, a 
little bittersweet to come so close.” 

Even 
though 
Finn 
never 

captured that elusive individual 
national championship, McGuire 
is unequivocally sure that she’s the 
best runner in program history.

“Erin’s the best distance runner 

we’ve ever had.” he said. “I’ll put up 
her body of work, and I don’t even 
think Katie would dispute it.”

Michigan’s finish was aided by 

juniors Avery Evenson and Gina 
Sereno, who finished in 18th and 
30th, respectively, and earned All-
America honors. Freshman Maddy 
Trevison, 46th, and redshirt junior 
Jaimie Phelan, 65th, also scored.

Trevison gave Michigan an 

impressive boost, finishing seventh 
out of all freshmen runners in her 
first collegiate championship race.

“All five of our scorers — and 

even Jamie Morrissey at number six 
— had great races,” McGuire said. 
“Maddy stepped up and probably 
ran 30 seconds faster than she did 
a month ago; Jaimie Phelan really 
came on with a really strong last 
kilometer 
where 
she 
probably 

passed upwards of 20 people. So 
in our scoring positions, we really 
couldn’t have asked for much more 
than what we got.”

Despite the surprising nature of 

the second-place result — the team 
entered the race ranked fifth and 
simply desired to reach the podium 
Saturday — the “what-ifs” crept 
into the minds of Michigan runners 
following the championship, as one 
position separated the Wolverines 
from a share of the national title.

“We were all kind of sitting here 

on the bus like, ‘Where could I have 
taken one more place?’ or ‘Where 
could we have gotten that last 
point?’ ” Evenson said. “We’re never 
going to blame one person, but it’s a 
what-if sort of situation.”

“What if” is a question that has 

followed Finn in the most painful of 
ways. She will go down as one of the 
greatest athletes in school history, 
as she contributed to an all-time 
showing for her team, and, yet, she 
fought back tears when reflecting 
on her career.

“I’m going to go back to 

bittersweet,” Finn said. “It’s been 
an incredible ride, and I’m so 
grateful to be a Wolverine and have 
finished that with my teammates. 
That fact that I could trust that 
every single one of them went out 
on the course giving everything 
they had — and knowing that I was 
doing the same — there’s nothing 
more special than that.”
