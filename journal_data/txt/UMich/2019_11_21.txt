About 
50 
students 
protested 
Wednesday 
afternoon in the “Human 
Chain for Survivors” event 
on the Diag in front of 
Hatcher Library. The protest 
contested the University of 
Michigan’s interim Title IX 
policy requiring a peer-to-
peer cross-examination in 
all Title IX cases, including 
cases of sexual misconduct 
and 
assault. 
The 
policy 
has been highly contested 
since it was implemented in 
December 2018. Roe v. Rape 
as well as the University 

chapter of the American 
Civil 
Liberties 
Union, 
hosted Wednesday’s event. 
Last 
year, 
the 
Sixth 
Circuit Court of Appeals 
ruled in the case of Doe v. 
Baum the University must 
allow cross-examination in 
sexual assault cases. The 
University 
petitioned 
for 
the Sixth Circuit Court to 
rehear the trial in October 
2018, but was denied. The 
University’s interim policy 
implemented 
the 
cross-
examinations 
and 
added 
a tenet that requires the 
question to be peer-to-peer.
LSA 
sophomore 
Emma 
Sandberg is one of many 

students who has argued 
peer-to-peer 
questioning 
forces 
the 
perpetrator 
to question their victim, 
inciting trauma and anxiety 
in survivors. 
“When someone has been 
sexually assaulted, they feel 
a sense of powerlessness 
and that’s one of the big 
reasons why people report: 
to take back their power 
and 
stand 
up 
to 
their 
perpetrator,” 
Sandberg 
said. “When a university 
allows 
a 
perpetrator 
to 
cross-examine their victim, 
the university is in effect 
allowing that perpetrator 
to have power over the 

victim again and I consider 
that to be cruel.”
Sandberg 
founded 
the 
non-profit Roe vs. Rape over 
the summer and is currently 
executive director of the 
organization. 
“The 
group 
helps 
survivors through activism 
and attempts to prevent 
sexual 
assault 
through 
education,” Sandberg said. 
Protestors linked together 
with a rope and the number 
of participants grew from 
ten to 50. Some protesters 
held signs in addition to the 
chants.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Chris 
Calabrese, 
vice 
president for policy at the 
Center for Democracy and 
Technology, was hosted by 
the 
Science, 
Technology 
and Public Policy program, 
Center for Ethics, Society 
and Computing and InSPIRE 
at the Ford School of Public 
Policy on Tuesday. About 
50 students and community 
members attended the lecture 
entitled, “Show Your Face? 

The Pros and Cons of Facial 
Recognition Technologies for 
Our Civil Liberties,” where 
Calabrese 
explained 
the 
social and ethical context of 
facial recognition technology.
“As we incorporate more 
and more technology into our 
lives, we need to think about 
the impact of that technology 
and what we want to do with 
it,” Calabrese said. “Face 
recognition is a really good 
example. It is powerful, it is 
useful and it is often dangerous. 
Like many technologies, it is a 

technology that can do so many 
things. It can find a wanted 
fugitive 
from 
surveillance 
footage. 
It 
can 
identify 
everybody at a protest rally.”
Calabrese explained the basic 
framework of the technology.
“It is a sort of measurement 
of people’s faces,” Calabrese 
said. “It is turning them into 
a discrete number that can 
be stored in databases and 
used to compare against other 
photos to see if I get that same 
measurement and see if I’ve 
identified that person.”

In the last five years, the 
National Institute of Standards 
and Technology has confirmed 
massive gains in the accuracy of 
facial recognition technology. 
This has been due to a variety 
of 
factors, 
including 
more 
powerful computers, greater 
data storage and more advanced 
artificial intelligence. Calabrese 
also 
commented 
on 
the 
privacy repercussions of facial 
recognition advancements.

About 50 students attended a 
TEDxUofM Salon event entitled 
“Eating Your Way to a More 
Sustainable Future” Wednesday 
evening in North Quad. The 
event featured a panel of five 
sustainable 
food 
industry 
experts from the University of 
Michigan and the Ann Arbor 
community. 
The 
event 
started 
by 
watching a TED Talk by Bruce 
Friedrich, 
co-founder 
and 
executive director of The Good 
Food Institute. In the video, 
Friedrich discussed how to 
create alternatives to the meat 
industry that cost the same or 
cheaper and taste the same or 
better than conventional meat.
Kathy Sample, owner and 
founder of Argus Farm Stop, a 
farmers market in Ann Arbor, 
emphasized 
her 
relationship 
with 
food 
and 
dedication 
to 
sustainability 
in 
her 
introduction. 
“I feel like the community 
around food is what makes 
families strong and what makes 
groups of people care about 
each other and spend time 
together doing something that’s 
meaningful,” Sample said.

coordinator 
at Sweetland Writing Center, 
has 
a 
daily 
eight-mile 
commute round trip between 
Ypsilanti and the University of 
Michigan campus. As a biker, 
Valdez said Fuller Avenue is 
a problem area for commuter 
safety. 
“It’s one of those places 
where I always have a problem 
every single day with almost 
being 
dead 
or 
watching 
someone almost being dead,” 
Valdez said. “I’m looking for 
some sort of solution to prevent 
these daily near-misses that 
happen.” 
On Wednesday night, Valdez 
attended Ann Arbor’s Moving

Towards 
Vision 
Zero open house at Larcom 
City Hall. Joining a national 
movement to reduce fatalities 
resulting from mobility and 
transportation in cities, Ann 
Arbor is headed to become 
a Vision Zero City. The city 
hosted the open house, which 
attracted about 50 community 
members like Valdez, to obtain 
feedback on bike lanes and 
transportation problem areas.

Vulnerabilities 
in 
virtual 
assistants such as Amazon 
Alexa or Google Assistant may 
allow laser beams to imitate 
audio commands and hack 
into these devices, researchers 
at the University of Michigan 
and the University of Electro-
Communications in Tokyo have 
found. 
Using a laser beam with just 
five milliwatts of power for 
the virtual assistants and 60 
milliwatts 
for 
smartphones 
and tablets, the researchers 
discovered 
the 
lasers 
can 
activate and hack different 
virtual assistants just by aiming 
light at different intensities into 
the microphones, calling the 
tactic “light commands.” The 
changing intensities of light act 
as sound waves that cause the 
microphone to react as if it is 
hearing sound. 
Engineering 
graduate 
student 
Benjamin 
Cyr, 
a 
member of the light commands 
research 
team, 
said 
light 
commands can be dangerous 
as they can grant individuals 
access to important information 
from far distances.
“With these devices, you 

have them in a secure location 
within 
a 
home 
where 
a 
passerby can’t talk and have 
it activate,” Cyr said. “But 
light, if it’s focused, will travel 
through windows and from 
long distances.”
Cyr said some of the tests 
the team completed were able 
to activate the devices with 
a laser beam from a distance 
of more than 100 meters. The 
team tested 17 different virtual 
assistant devices using a tripod, 
telescope and telephoto lens. 
Videos 
on 
the 
research 
project’s website show the team 
successfully injecting different 
commands 
from 
varying 
distances 
into 
the 
Google 
Home device to open a garage 
door and to say what time it is, 
once from the top of the North 
Campus bell tower to an office 
in the Bob and Betty Beyster 
building. 
The researchers successfully 
hacked into virtual assistant 
devices using equipment, some 
bought from Amazon, for a 
total under $500. Though they 
had previously not heard of 
light commands being used to 
hack into virtual assistants, 
Cyr said the technique would 
be very easy for an individual 
to use.

LSA Student Government releases 
statement on misconduct policy

The updated University protocol comes as result of the Sixth Circuit Court ruling on Doe v. Baum 

The Executive Board of 
the University of Michigan 
LSA Student Government 
released 
a 
statement 
Wednesday 
criticizing 
the University’s interim 
sexual misconduct policy. 
The 
policy, 
titled 
the Interim Policy and 
Procedures 
on 
Student 
Sexual and Gender-Based 
Misconduct 
and 
Other 
Forms of Interpersonal 
Violence, 
was 
updated 
to 
include 
additional 
options in the resolution 
process and a hearing 
where students have the 
opportunity 
to 
cross-
examine other students 

and witnesses. All cases 
open at the time of the 
new policy, which was 
released on Jan. 9, adhere 
to its guidelines.
Changes to the policy 
came as a result of a Sixth 
Circuit Court ruling in Doe 
v. Baum. In the lawsuit, 
the 
court 
affirmed 
a 
student accused of sexual 
misconduct has a right to 
confront their accuser at a 
hearing.
In the statement, the 
board called the policy 
“problematic.” 
The 
board wrote that while it 
supports students’ rights 
to due process, it feels 
there are better avenues 
than the current options 

for achieving a resolution. 
The board also wrote 
the 
alternatives 
to 
in-person 
examination, 
such as using video chat 
from separate locations or 
utilizing the text option 
of BlueJeans, an online 
video chat service, fall 
short. 
“While 
we 
recognize 
that these options are an 
attempt by the University 
to mitigate the harm that 
this process may cause the 
complainant, we do not 
find these to be acceptable 
substitutes 
as 
the 
process of direct cross-
examination 
between 
the parties involved in 
the 
investigation 
can 
be 
hurtful 
in 
any 
format,” 
the 
board 
wrote. 
“While 
we 
recognize that every 
student 
deserves 
a 
fair and equal process 
when allegations are 
made, we know that 
there are better ways 
to achieve justice.” 
Additionally, 
the 
board 
wrote 
the 
current 
policy 
discourages students 
from reporting sexual 
misconduct 
and 
ultimately 
creates 
a 
hostile 
campus 
environment. 
The 
board noted differing 
processes 
at 
peer 
institutions, 
such 
as 
the 
University 
of 
California, 
Los 
Angeles, 
which 
do 
not 
require 
cross-
examination. 
The board requested 
the University revise 
its cross-examination 
process so it is carried 
out by a professional 
representative 

trained in handling these 
scenarios. 
The 
statement 
comes 
after 
a 
call 
from 
the 
American Civil Liberties 
Union on Sept. 5 to change 
the policy and student 
activism on campus. A 
petition to change the 
policy created on Jan. 8 
by the student group ‘Jane 
Roe’ garnered over 65,000 
signatures.
University 
spokesman 
Rick 
Fitzgerald 
wrote 
in an email to The Daily 
that, the University is 
accepting 
feedback 
on 
the interim policy until 
Friday, 
in 
addition 
to 
awaiting guidance from 
the U.S. Department of 
Education on guidelines 
that will apply to all 
universities.
Fitzgerald 
noted 
the 
policy 
allows 
students 
the option to have the 
hearing 
conducted 
in 
separate 
rooms 
using 
technology 
or 
through 
written responses with no 
audio or video. However, 
he said the University 
has 
previously 
shown 
reluctance 
to 
allowing 
attorneys to participate 
in this process alongside 
students.
 
“Unlike 
students, 
attorneys have an ethical 
duty to represent their 
clients 
zealously,” 
Fitzgerald wrote. “That 
includes 
an 
ethical 
duty to vigorously cross 
examine witnesses. Thus, 
as the courts have held, 
an attorney may have an 
ethical duty to ‘confuse’ 
or even ‘destroy’ a student 
who is alleging sexual 
assault.”

Arab Student Association, Period 
host panel on reproductive health

Panelists focus on own experiences, discuss stigmatized issues as part of Focus Week

BRAYDEN HIRSCH 
For The Daily 

Through an effort to end 
the stigma around periods, 
the Arab Student Association 
and Period collaborated to 
hold a panel where four people 
from 
various 
backgrounds 
were given the opportunity 
to talk about their encounters 
with reproductive health on 
Wednesday. About 30 students 
attended the event. ASA is 
currently holding a week-long 
program called Focus Week, 
where the goal is to talk about 
the stigmatized issues facing 
their communities. 
Public Policy senior, Arwa 
Gayar, co-president of ASA, 
played a large role in putting 
the panel together. 
“We 
thought 
that 
this 
was particularly important 
because 
menstrual 
health 
and 
reproductive 
health 
are seen as taboo in our 
culture, but it really affects a 
woman of color, particularly 
Arab 
refugees, 
and 
they 
are 
disproportionately 
marginalized, not just from 
their identity, but also their 
status 
as 
immigrants 
and 
refugees,” Gayar said. “So 

understanding their access 
to 
reproductive, 
menstrual 
health and is very important 
to look at it through the lens 
of those identities.”
The 
panel 
consisted 
of 
four 
women 
of 
varying 
backgrounds. Public Health 
graduate 
student 
Ashley 
Rapp discussed her point-
of-view on menstrual and 
reproductive health of her 
family from Iraq and being the 
founder of Period.
“Primarily, at least for a 
lot of the people that came to 
America, one of our biggest 
issues is that even though 
people are coming through, 
they’re able to access things 
like food stamps, and different 
things like that,” Rapp said. 
“There’s a lot of difficulty 
that even some of my relatives 
are 
having 
with 
having 
access to, you know, things 
that are more than that. So 
that’s going to be things like 
menstrual products, but also 
different things to help their 
reproductive care.”
Another 
organization 
that played a large role in 
the planning of this panel 
was Period. Period is an 
organization centered around 

service 
and 
education 
for 
women. Public Health junior 
Swathi 
Komarivelli 
also 
helped plan this event. The 
panel 
was 
a 
continuation 
of 
Period’s 
product 
drive 
where they collected over 
15,000 products for people in 
Southeast Michigan. 
“We just want to have this 
panel because we want to have 
an educational background 
behind the drive,” Komarivelli 
said. “Most people realize that 
they face disparate conditions, 
but, going into specifics was 
the idea behind this.”
Each member on the panel 
was given the opportunity 
to 
talk 
about 
challenges 
they have faced in terms of 
menstrual and reproductive 
health. Public Health senior 
Umaima Abbasi is a green 
card holder and was able to 
tell her story as well. 
“I do have some experiences 
like when you’re going around 
the healthcare system, so I 
actually was uninsured up 
until two weeks ago… But 
it’s kind of hard to navigate 
around a system that wasn’t 
initially created for you to 
be here,” Abbasi said. “So 
three weeks ago, I got a really 

terrible 
bacterial 
infection 
and I didn’t know how to go 
about it, like I didn’t know 
where I can find care, and also 
culturally competent care.” 
LSA senior Tala Al-Saghir, 
president of Students Organize 
for Syria, was another member 
of the panel. Al-Saghir is 
currently applying to medical 
school and was able to provide 
more of a medically-based 
perspective on the importance 
of menstrual and reproductive 
care.
“For a lot of refugees, 
the primary needs, like the 
emergency needs are shelter, 
water, food and education 
for their children,” Al-Saghir 
said. 
“So 
you 
see 
that 
reproductive health and a lot 
of health issues overall just 
kind of get pushed to the side.” 
LSA senior Ayah Kutmah 
talked about the importance 
of normalizing some of these 
tough, yet important topics. 
“Breaking 
that 
cultural 
stigma is very hard, but it 
can 
definitely 
start 
with 
having those uncomfortable 
conversations, 
especially 
within communities that you 
identify with,” Kutmah said.

Overseeing 
the 
Vision 
Zero 
project, 
City 
Transportation 
Manager 
Eli 
Cooper 
coordinated 
the event, which was one 
of three total open houses 
planned. Larcom’s lobby 
presented two interactive 
displays. One wall hosted 
posters of five Ann Arbor 
locations; 
underneath 
each, 
community 
members 
ranked 
how 
they prioritized the four 
transportation options of 
biking, 
walking, 
transit 
and vehicle. 
“These 
specific 
(locations) are similar to 
other roads in the city — or 
streets — that have similar 
characteristics,” 
Cooper 
said. 
“The 
opportunity 
is to gain a general sense 
of what the public feels 
about the priorities for 
the various modes by the 
different 
characteristics 
for the corridors.”
Across 
from 
the 
ranking posters, AECOM 
Transportation 
Planner 
Sarah Lagpacan facilitated 
an activity to find out 
what community members 

consider the city’s safest 
biking 
areas. 
A 
wall-
length poster displayed a 
map of Ann Arbor streets, 
highlighting 
biker-
friendly areas in green. 
Markers were provided for 
community 
members 
to 
draw in where they felt this 
network needs to expand. 
“We’re not going into 
this with any expectations 
of what we’ll hear but 
really wanting to see what 
people say,” Lagpacan said. 
Through the project, the 
city is looking to provide 
a guiding document for 
Ann 
Arbor’s 
current 
transportation 
policies 
by the summer of 2020. 
If successful, Ann Arbor 
will be the first Vision 
Zero City in Michigan, 
joiningAustin, New York 
City, 
Philadelphia 
and 
others. To qualify, each 
city must have a clear 
goal to eliminate traffic 
fatalities 
and 
severe 
injuries, an official public 
commitment by the mayor 
to Vision Zero and key city 
departments 
engaged 
in 
the effort. 
“Transportation 
as 
a 
system responds to the 
demands of the users and 
by 
engaging 
with 
our 
citizens that are the folks 

traveling around the city,” 
Cooper said. 
Using both transit and 
biking, Valdez has plans to 
follow upcoming changes 
in the Vision Zero project.
“A lot of times you find 
out as the thing is being 
built or not really informed 
along 
the 
way,” 
Valdez 
said. “I’m just trying to get 
more informed during the 
planning stages and find 
out what exactly is going 
on.”
Keeping 
community 
members engaged in the 
project is exactly what 
Cooper aims to do.
“It’s not that we have a 
group of planners off in an 
office figuring out what’s 
best,” Cooper said. “We’re 
actually listening to what 
the publics’ interest and 
values 
are, 
where 
they 
would like to see progress. 
The open house allows 
people to come in and learn 
about the project, where 
we are in the process, but 
we 
are 
also 
collecting 
information 
from 
them 
that we will use to shape 
the 
direction 
of 
where 
we’re going.”

Daniel 
Genkin, 
electrical 
engineering 
and 
computer 
science 
assistant professor, also 
worked on the project and 
pointed out most people 
think 
of 
sound 
rather 
than light in regards to 
a 
microphone, 
Genkin 
said the vulnerabilities in 
virtual assistants that let 
light commands control 
them 
could 
potentially 
create a serious safety 
issue.
“The 
system 
that 
responds 
to 
sound 
actually 
delivers 
the 
system that responds to 
sound and light,” Genkin 
said. 
“Every 
time 
you 
have this gap, you have a 
security problem … When 
you think about those 
gaps, and where we need 
to map them out, then we 
need to think, what are 
the implications and how 
do we close them?”
Using light commands, 
an 
individual 
could 
easily 
have 
access 
to 
unlock doors, go online 
shopping 
using 
the 
target’s 
information 
or 
unlock and start a vehicle 
connected to the target’s 
device, Cyr said.
LSA 
sophomore 
Kat 
Black uses an Amazon 
Alexa at home. She said 
the results of the study 

show light commands can 
be a serious threat. 
“There 
have 
been 
several times where our 
Alexa at home kind of 
malfunctioned and that 
was unprompted,” Black 
said. “I think if someone 
is deliberately trying to 
alter its functioning, it’s 
very possible.”
Cyr 
said 
the 
team 
reached out to Amazon 
and 
Google 
to 
inform 
them 
of 
the 
security 
issues 
light 
commands 
may cause. They also plan 
to reach out to Facebook 
and 
other 
microphone 
manufacturers 
to 
help 
them find ways to fix this 
vulnerability. 
“Our goal is to make 
sure that people know 
what can be done to the 
sensors 
currently 
and 
then to find solutions so 
that people can trust the 
sensors,” Cyr said.
As for now, Cyr said 
those who have a virtual 
assistant in their home 
should keep them away 
from windows and areas 
where 
they 
could 
be 
easily accessible from the 
outside.
The research team also 
included EECS professor 
Kevin Fu and postdoctoral 
student Sara Rampazzi 
from the University as 
well as Takeshi Sugawara 
from the University of 
Electro-Communications 
in Tokyo. 

HACKING

“The reality is, when 
you are out in public, you 
do not necessarily expect 
to 
be 
identified 
and 
tracked across a series 
of 
cameras,” 
Calabrese 
said. “And you do not 
expect that record to be 
kept indefinitely. It is a 
different type of use of 
the technology. And it 
changes our assumptions 
about what privacy looks 

like 
for 
the 
average 
citizen.”
Despite the cautionary 
commentary provided by 
Calabrese earlier in the 
lecture, he also pointed 
out the benefits of the 
technology. 
“You 
can 
imagine 
that maybe there is a 
photo that might be held 
somewhere in your social 
network 
that 
can 
be 
cross-referenced to find a 
missing child,” Calabrese 
said.
Calabrese 
explained 
facial 
recognition 

technology 
also 
has 
everyday 
implications. 
For 
example, 
social 
media platforms use it 
to suggest friends and 
make connections based 
on images uploaded by 
users. 
When 
talking 
about how the ordinary 
citizen 
is 
impacted 
by 
the 
technology, 
Calabrese emphasized the 
importance of regulation 
and consent.
“The first thing we need 
to talk about is consent… 
it can be so easy to create 
a face template from a 

photo,” 
Calabrese 
said. 
“After consent is obtained, 
transparency 
will 
then 
allow 
people 
to 
know 
what facial recognition 
will be used for.”
For 
the 
second 
half 
of 
the 
talk, 
Shobita 
Parthasarathy, professor 
of 
Public 
Policy 
and 
Women’s 
Studies 
and 
director of the Science, 
Technology 
and 
Public 
Policy 
program, 
joined 
Calabrese to talk about 
accuracy and bias of the 
technology. 
He 
explained 
the 

accuracy 
of 
facial 
recognition 
technology 
can vary depending on 
the conditions upon the 
capturing of the image, 
especially if the subject 
is within complete field 
of view or if lighting 
conditions are optimal. 
Parthasarathy 
also 
noted facial recognition is 
less accurate for people of 
color.
“I think it is important 
to 
point 
out 
that 
the 
technology 
is 
most 
accurate among white men 
and then it degrades in 

accuracy,” Parthasarathy 
said. 
In an interview with 
The Daily, LSA sophomore 
Sujin Kim explained the 
relevance of the lecture 
to University of Michigan 
students.
“I 
think 
addressing 
the 
relevant 
bias 
in 
the technology is very 
important,” Kim said. “It 
addressed 
the 
inherent 
bias of the technology 
that someone might not 
necessarily know about if 
it wasn’t brought to their 
attention.”

Posters reflected similar 
messages, and one poster 
had a quote from a fireside 
chat given by University 
President Mark Schlissel 
earlier in the year: “We 
thought… it might be less 
traumatizing to have a peer 
ask questions of another 
peer.” 
Similar messages were 
written in chalk around the 
Diag.
 The activists chanted 
various 
slogans, 
such 

as: “Join the chain, this 
policy’s 
insane,” 
“We 
reject the administration’s 
disrespect,” “Say it loud, 
say it clear: no perpetrator 
is our peer,” and “Hey hey, 
ho ho, direct questioning 
has got to go.”
LSA junior Elyas Perry 
said he joined the chain in 
part because of his friend 
who has suffered similar 
trauma.
“I’ve 
experienced 
firsthand how neglectful 
some of these policies that 
the 
University 
has 
can 
be,” Perry said. “With the 
addition of this policy here, 

where 
perpetrators 
can 
actually 
cross-examine 
victims face-to-face. I have 
a little bit more perspective 
on how damaging that can 
be.” 
One of the protesters’ 
primary demands was to 
require attorneys to conduct 
the 
cross-examination, 
not the respondents and 
claimants 
themselves. 
Previous responses to the 
issue from administration is 
that it raises issues of equity 
and 
accessibility 
with 
students unable to afford 
attorneys. In an interview 
with 
The 
Daily 
earlier 

this 
month, 
E. 
Royster 
Harper, vice president for 
student life, said bringing 
in attorneys would create 
mini-court 
scenes 
on 
campus and the “last thing” 
administration wants to do 
is perpetuate the broken 
system of handling sexual 
misconduct cases. 
To resolve this problem, 
the 
protestors 
believe 
the 
University 
has 
a 
responsibility 
to 
cover 
hourly attorney costs for 
the duration of the cross-
examination, rather than 
turning 
to 
peer-to-peer 
questioning. 

“Unfortunately, when you 
have 
cross-examination 
in 
university 
sexual 
misconduct cases, it will be 
like a courtlike procedure. 
There’s nothing we can do 
about that,” Sandberg said. 
“All they can do is try to 
make the procedure as good 
as it can be and the current 
policy that they have is 
unimaginable. 
Anything 
would be better than the 
current policy.”
Medical student Solomon 
Rajput, who is currently 
challenging 
U.S. 
Rep. 
Debbie 
Dingell, 
D-Ann 
Arbor, 
for 
her 
seat 
in 

Congress, 
attended 
the 
event and said the turnout 
shows the importance of 
challenging 
the 
sexual 
assault policy.
“There 
are 
so 
many 
people 
who’ve 
decided 
they’re going to take the 
time out of their busy 
schedule in order to take a 
stance on this issue,” Rajput 
said. “You can’t just do 
what’s convenient or what 
is going to be polite in order 
to see the change that you 
want to happen.”

The event was moderated 
by Business junior Riya 
Gupta 
and 
LSA 
junior 
Shivani 
Bhargava, 
who 
asked the panelists two 
questions, and then opened 
the 
floor 
for 
audience 
questions. The questions 
were centered on problems 
challenging 
sustainability 
and how much individuals’ 
decisions, such as to be 
vegan or vegetarian, have 
an impact on the food 
industry.
Lilly Shapiro, Sustainable 
Food 
Systems 
Initiative 
project 
manager, 
echoed 
other 
panelists 
about 
the current level of food 
production and the excess 
that goes to waste.
“We grow more than 
enough food to feed the 
world and we do not need 
more industrial farming to 
feed the world,” Shapiro 
said. “The issues are equity 
and distribution. The issue 
is not production.”
On the topic of individual 
impact, the panelists agreed 
individual actions can make 
a difference. Shapiro also 
explained individuals are 
only one part of the puzzle, 

and there needs to be a 
focus on sustainability from 
leaders in the industry as 
well.
Jeremy 
Moghtader, 
program 
manager 
for 
the Campus Farm at the 
University, spoke of human 
behavior tendencies to do 
what 
is 
convenient 
and 
encouraged 
industry 
to 
use this psychology for the 
better.
“You design a system 
that makes it so that people 
follow the path of least 
resistance to the better 
outcome,” Moghtader said. 
“It’s both about personal 
choice and the environment 
in which we make those 
personal choices.”
The event concluded with 
an exercise to physically 
represent individual’s daily 
greenhouse 
gas 
carbon 
footprint. The organizers 
gave each audience member 
a balloon and asked them to 
blow air into it to correspond 
to how damaging foods they 
eat are to the environment. 
The 
organizers 
posted 
common food items on the 
board, and the equivalent 
puffs of air for each one. 
LSA 
junior 
Elana 
Weberman 
said 
she 
liked 
how 
the 
activity 
represented 
personal 

consumption habits.
“It’s really important to 
participate in events that 
U of M puts on that focus 
on sustainability because 
there’s so much that we can 
do and continue to learn 
about,” Weberman said. “In 
order to make a difference 
in the field of sustainability, 
it’s important for every 
individual to do their part. 
Also it’s really important to 
have this cultural change, 
these behavioral changes 
where people come together 
to make a difference.”
Gupta said she learned 
so much in organizing the 
event and was very happy 
with 
the 
turnout. 
She 
emphasized 
the 
balloon 
activity seemed to have an 
impact on attendees. 
“We really wanted to find 
something that’s relevant to 
the U-M community right 
now that students really 
care about and the Ann 
Arbor 
community 
could 
really care about,” Gupta 
said. “Sustainable business 
is something our whole 
team was excited about. 
We just dove headfirst into 
it. We think it’s a really 
relevant topic that needs to 
have more awareness built 
around it.”

Pay attention to the movements in Latin America
T

he past few months have 
been tumultuous for 
many around the world. 
From Kurdistan to Hong Kong, 
to the U.K. and Yemen, there are 
many different crises that are 
dominating the news cycle at 
the moment. But one thing that 
I’ve found to be inadequately 
covered by mainstream media, 
like CNN, and unknown to 
many is the ongoing protests 
occurring 
all 
across 
Latin 
America. 
Haiti, 
Chile 
and 
Ecuador all find themselves 
in political turmoil, wracked 
by protests and movements 
in an attempt to change the 
status quo. It seems like the 
region has exploded into a fiery 
chasm of demonstrations and 
fulminations.
Headlines 
have 
recently 
covered the cancellation of a 
climate summit in Santiago, 
but the protests in Chile are 
the result of tensions that have 
been ongoing for some time 
now. The reported cause of the 
original protests was a rise in 
metro fare, an increase of 30 
Chilean pesos (equivalent to 
about 4 U.S. cents) in the cost of 
using public transport. It may 
seem insignificant to us, but for 
many, the increase represents 
the 
growing 
economic 
inequality in Chile. One percent 
of the country’s population 
makes 33 percent of the total 
income, making it one of the 
most unequal economies in the 
developed world. Many of the 
protesters are calling for the 
drafting of a new constitution, 
criticizing the current one for 
prioritizing 
private 
entities 
over the working people of 
the 
country. 
The 
current 
constitution was drafted by 
the government of Augusto 
Pinochet, a fascist dictator 
who 
won 
the 
government 
in a coup in 1973 (which the 
United 
States 
orchestrated, 
by the way). These protests 
have 
overwhelming 
student 
involvement, 
with 
younger 
generations being integral to 

the success of the movement. 
The 
initial 
demonstrations 
were organized by students, 
after all. One can take a glance 
at the situation and notice 
how it reflects the growing 
concerns of wealth inequality 
for the youth here in the U.S. 
In Haiti, protests erupted 
last 
month 
over 
growing 
concerns about fuel shortages, 
out-of-control 
inflation 
and 
general 
exasperation 
with wealth inequality. The 
spark to ignite the powder 
keg, however, can be traced 
back 
to 
the 
PetroCaribe 
oil program, which was an 
economic 
pact 
negotiated 
with Venezuela to increase 
investment in public services 
for the country. Billions of 
dollars 
of 
investments 
in 
public works projects have 
been unaccounted for, which 
raises many questions about 
where the money was really 
spent. Protesters are hounding 
Jovenel Moïse, Haiti’s current 
president, pressuring him to 
step down amid allegations 
of 
corruption 
and 
failed 
leadership. Over half of Haiti’s 
population lives below the 
poverty line, landing it as the 
poorest country in the Western 
Hemisphere. 
These 
various 
conditions, 
corruption 
and 
few economic opportunities 
led to cripplingly low faith 
in government. In fact, only 
21 percent of the electorate 
turned 
out 
for 
the 
2016 
presidential 
election. 
The 
sentiments found here are 
similar to the ones in Chile, 
caused by economic inequality 
and a government ill-equipped 
to handle the consequences of 
a poorer populace.
Ecuador is another nation 
that’s 
been 
afflicted 
with 
protests and demonstrations 
this past month. Though the 
protests have ended, we can 
still look to it as an example 
of 
the 
recurring 
problem 
many Latin American nations 
have been encountering. The 

protests initially started as a 
response to the government’s 
termination 
of 
gasoline 
subsidies, nearly doubling the 
price of diesel in the country. 
In addition to that, many 
criticize 
President 
Lenin 
Moreno’s 
privatization 
of 
public services, especially with 
the $4.2 billion dollar austerity 
package he secured with the 
International Monetary Fund 
in March. The package was 
designed to increase economic 
sustainability 
and 
assist 
the lower class, making the 
inaction all the more poignant. 
The stakes quickly evolved 
to 
eventually 
encompass 
many other grievances the 
population wanted addressed. 
Abortion rights and indigenous 
rights became focal points 
of the protest as well. The 
protests eventually came to a 
close when Moreno decided to 
meet with indigenous leaders 
and negotiate an agreement, 
canceling 
the 
austerity 
package and reviewing the 
public debt of the nation.
You may be asking yourself 
why this concerns you. It seems 
like a world away from the 
struggles here in the U.S. But 
the protests are emblematic 
of a common phenomenon 
taking hold among the masses 
on a global scale. In the 
face of growing inequality 
and 
negligent 
governments 
unwilling to address it, people 
are uniting and having their 
voices heard — whether or not 
the ruling class wants to hear 
it. When confronted with a 
changing political landscape, 
one 
must 
ask 
themselves 
where their allegiances lie. 
Young people, students and 
the disenfranchised alike are 
banding together to make a 
stand. The protests in Latin 
America are more than just 
momentary unrest, they are 
signs of changing tides.

W

e 
are 
all, 
paradoxically, agents 
of 
social 
change 
operating 
within 
forces 
of 
social 
control. 
The 
limitless 
spontaneity of our 
minds is imprisoned 
by 
a 
variety 
of 
internalized social 
structures, 
ones 
we often mistake 
as the ultimatums 
of life. As a result, 
some 
actions 
or 
behaviors 
are 
arbitrarily 
deemed more acceptable than 
others. 
We 
often 
address 
the fact that “actions have 
consequences,” 
but 
rarely 
ever acknowledge that actions 
themselves 
are 
rooted 
in 
some limited understanding 
of the world. Much of our 
understanding of the world 
and a majority of our own 
biases and perspectives come 
from rigid and internalized 
social structures. To develop 
true objectivity, we must not 
only be aware of the world 
and its processes but also our 
own preconceived notions and 
ideologies. 
Our 
entire 
lives 
are 
a 
quest for knowledge. In fact, 
we often measure personal 
growth in the context of 
how much we have learned. 
Applying 
what 
we 
learn, 
however, 
is 
the 
truest 
measure of personal growth, 
and this is often not possible 
because of the limitations 
society places on us. We 
are taught at a young age to 
treat others the way we wish 
to be treated, but how has 
this played out considering 
we’ve internalized systems 

of 
patriarchy, 
oppression 
and racism? Recently, two 
Indian-American New Jersey 
teens were arrested 
for 
repeatedly 
hurling racial slurs 
at a group of young 
African-American 
middle school girls. 
Surely, these boys 
are 
intelligent 
enough 
to 
know 
that 
this 
action 
is wrong and has 
consequences, 
yet 
they 
acted 
in this way because of an 
internalized 
anti-Black 
sentiment that overpowered 
judgment. 

Teaching 
people 
that 
their actions will lead to 
consequences is not enough 
— 
we 
must 
also 
learn 
to 
unlearn. 
Unlearning 
consists of recognizing that 
we have all been imbued 
with 
the 
constructs 
of 
heteronormativity, patriarchy 
and 
racial 
superiority 
and 
then 
challenging 
the 
dominant values presented to 
us. No privilege absolves an 
individual from unlearning, 
and 
the 
responsibility 
certainly does not fall upon 
those who have experienced 
oppression to teach someone 
else to unlearn. Unlearning 

is not about forgetting, it is 
about taking the knowledge 
we have at hand and learning 
to interpret it differently and 
opting for alternative mental 
paradigms. 
Acknowledging 
a 
history 
of 
racism 
and 
dismantling 
internalized 
prejudices is unlearning, while 
ignoring a history of racism or 
acting crudely in spite of it is 
simply ignorance.
Unlearning may be difficult, 
as 
we 
have 
a 
biological 
predisposition to act in ways 
that confirm our initial biases. 
Recognizing these tendencies, 
normalizing 
conversations 
around race and inequality 
and 
incorporating 
in-depth 
discussions and studies of the 
work of individuals who have 
repeatedly challenged these 
norms in history can all help 
overcome these biases.
Moreover, 
the 
value 
of 
unlearning 
is 
unlimited. 
Individuals 
will 
be 
more 
adaptive 
to 
situations, 
be 
less inhibited in diversifying 
their own experiences and 
will become more empathetic 
overall 
once 
they 
unlearn 
harmful 
constructs. 
This 
process 
recognizes 
that 
nothing is black and white, 
and that we should practice 
multidimensional recognition.
Unlearning is not a process 
that can be taught or learned — 
it comes from self-awareness. 
As a result, unlearning can 
be 
encouraged 
through 
diverse 
teaching 
materials 
and policies but must be 
reinforced and maintained 
individually. 
It 
must 
be 
encouraged, not forced.

ith 
the 
Iranian 
regime’s 
announcement 
on 
Nov. 5 that they would resume 
their

of 
weapons-grade

the Middle East is 
about 
to 
become 
even more chaotic

dangerous 
for enemies of the 
Islamic

That includes the

an 
especially bad sign 
for Israel. Already facing great 
opposition on nearly all of its 
borders from Iranian proxies 
and groups receiving Tehran’s 
funding, it would be a crisis if the 
thousands of missiles possessed 
by these groups, or Iran itself, 
were suddenly enhanced with 
nuclear payloads. An article in 
The Atlantic by Michael Oren, 
former Israeli Ambassador to 
the U.S., lays out the potential 
outcomes for the Jewish state 
should this reality come to 
fruition. 
It is clear that one of Iran’s 
main objectives in amassing 
their arsenal of weapons is to 
take down the country which 
the late Ayatollah Khomeini 
once called “the Little Satan.” 
The regime has said so itself. 
With Iran’s leaders formally 
signaling their resumption of 
nuclear development, it appears 
that the threat of annihilation 
from Iran that Israelis have 
feared could be more of a 
possibility.
In this context, comments 
made by prominent Democratic 
candidates for president at the 
national conference for the 
left-leaning J Street group in 
Washington, D.C. last month 
appear dangerously misguided. 
In 
their 
speeches, 
Sen. 
Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., along 
with South Bend Mayor Pete 
Buttigieg and Julián Castro, 
former Secretary of Housing 
and Urban Development, all 
addressed — to some degree — 
the possibility of their future 

administrations one day using 
the U.S.’s annual $3.8 billion 
military aid package as a way 
to curb Israeli policies with 
which they disagree. 
These remarks follow 
a similar statement 
by 
Sen. 
Elizabeth 
Warren, D-Mass., and 
reflect a general lack 
of awareness of the 
situation Israel faces 
and the implications 
that such an action 
would have. 
The military aid 
that 
the 
U.S. 
has 
pledged to Israel over the 
years has been a sign of the 
enduring partnership between 
these countries: the American 
belief that a strong Israel only 
serves to make us stronger. 

In his speech to the J Street 
conference as vice ptesident in 
2013, prominent 2020 candidate 
Joe Biden said that “If there 
were not an Israel, we would 
have to invent one to make sure 
our interests (in the Middle 
East) were preserved.” This is 
the sentiment that Democrats 
need to make clear to American 
Jews and the entire American 
public 
leading 
up 
to 
the 
presidential election just a year 
from now. The partnership of 
these two countries is strategic 
to the interests of both and 
cannot be put at risk over 
policy disagreements between 
a particular administration.
Cutting 
military 
aid 
to 
Israel now, in a time when 
Israel is facing perhaps its 

greatest 
external 
threats 
in decades, would signal a 
lack of commitment to the 
important bond between these 
two 
countries 
in 
defense, 
economics, 
innovation 
and science. As part of the 
requisites 
for 
receiving 
billions of dollars in military 
assistance, 
Israel 
and 
its 
armed forces are required to 
spend the entirety of the aid 
package on U.S. weaponry and 
equipment. In this way, funds 
that were set aside for foreign 
aid have been returning to the 
U.S. economy and boosting its 
military technology industry. 
This 
policy, 
often 
accused 
of being a unilateral gifting 
of taxpayer dollars to Israel, 
also 
has 
tangible 
benefits 
to America and its defense 
contractors such as Lockheed 
Martin and Raytheon. It is an 
arrangement that is beneficial 
to the two nations and should 
be continued under the future 
U.S. administration.
Politicians can reasonably 
disagree about the course of 
action Israel should take in its 
domestic and foreign policy. 
However, it should remain a 
consensus that U.S. military 
assistance to Israel — which 
boosts the American economy 
and strengthens one of its most 
important and loyal allies — 
remains intact for years to 
come. 
Israel 
faces 
growing 
uncertainty and danger in its 
future as regional adversaries 
continuously prepare to bring 
about its destruction. U.S. allies 
need to be able to count on 
America for consistent support, 
not only through rhetoric, but 
through our actions. Using 
the threat of ending military 
aid as a club to force the 
implementation of a desired 
policy is harmful to American 
interests, to Israel and to our 
important relationship. It is a 
mistake that any future leader 
should be sure to avoid.

Aid to Israel cannot be conditional

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far 
away, the very conception of morality 
was a defined line. There was good 
and evil. The long lost Jedis and the 
Galactic Empire. Luke Skywalker and 
Emperor Palpatine. Mixed into this was 
a rich mythology, deepening with each 
installment. The saga filled itself with 
imaginative creatures and species — 
with more and more heroes. But “The 
Mandalorian” is not about heroes.
A space-western, “The Mandalorian” 
follows a masked bounty hunter who 
wanders the far reaches of the galaxy. 
The unnamed protagonist belongs to the 
Mandalorians — a mercenary warrior 
people who describe themselves as a 
“tribe.” The Mandalorian (Pedro Pascal, 
“Game of Thrones”) takes an under-
the-table bounty, which leads him to a 
suspicious solicitor with ties to the now-
defunct authoritarian military regime, 
the Galactic Empire. He’s looking for 
a 
dangerous 
creature, fifty 
years old and 
unnamed. 
All 
the 
Mandalorian 
is 
given 
is 
a 
tracking 
device. 
The 
bounty 
is 
to 
be 
brought 
back 
alive. 
The 
tracker 
takes 
the 
Mandalorian to Arvala-7, where he’s 
rescued from Blurggs by a vapor farmer 
named 
Kuiil 
(Nick 
Nolte, 
“Angel 
Has Fallen”). But this bounty proves 
dangerous indeed. More than that, 
though, it’s not what he thought it was at 
all.
The Mandalorian clearly exists on 
the vast moral spectrum of the ever-
expanding Star Wars universe. He is 
willing to kill a number of people in a bar 
in the very opening scene and is disposed 
to eradicating an entire town of people, if 
it happens to be the case that they’re also 
shooting at him. The Mandalorian has 
an uncompromising sense of objective. 
But his complicated bounty makes him 
question his complicated principles. He 
has little personality and can’t take off 

his helmet, due in part to his religion as 
a Mandalorian. Still, he’s given voice and 
agency through actions, be them subtle or 
violent.
There were moments where I was 
certain “The Mandalorian” would suffer 
from its reliance on its own mythology, 
yet it manages to maintain the delicate 
balance of engaging its audiences in a 
world both foreign and familiar. The 
show — taking place five years after 
the events of “Return of the Jedi” and 
before “The Force Awakens” — nods to a 
universally beloved trilogy to orient itself 
while also successfully embracing the 
hidden details of that trilogy in order to 
explore bolder, more ambiguous themes.
However, it is the western plot that 
propels “The Mandalorian” forward. The 
show is very minimalist, relying more on 
atmosphere and arid landscapes — both 
frigid and blazing — as backdrops. The 
technology is there, but it takes a backseat, 
allowing character, environment and 
creature to forge the ambience. Aided 
by twangy, distant guitars and beating 
drums, the lonelier scenes are gripping 
and intense.
The 
most 
compelling 
element of “The 
Mandalorian” 
is the bounty 
itself. Perhaps 
it’s 
already 
been 
spoiled, 
but 
I 
refuse 
to wreck the 
twists 
and 
turns. I will say 
that the bounty 
is both puzzling and wonderful, almost 
demanding to see its arc carried through. 
The fact is that “The Mandalorian” is 
bold and confident. For having slim, 
fast-paced episodes (that are almost 
too short), the show is very willing to 
take its time, to ponder its setting and 
consequences. In the first two episodes, 
viewers are given hints of a grim past, 
of questions of ancestry, integrity and 
principle. In the absence of Jedis and 
Darth Vaders, all that remains are people, 
all with questionable morals, struggling 
to make it through the economic ruin of 
a collapsed government in a galaxy far, 
far away. “The Mandalorian” is less about 
science fiction. It’s about who we think 
we are and what we might do if that’s 
called into question.

‘The Mandalorian’ is 
engaging minimalism

“Our priority is to do things that matter, first and 
foremost,” said MUSKET producer and LSA senior 
Alexandra Niforous about the first show of the MUSKET 
season. “BARE: A Pop Opera” is directed by SMTD senior 
James Harbaugh Jr. with music and book by Damon 
Intrabartolo (“Dreamgirls”) and lyrics and book by Jon 
Hartmere (“The Upside”). 
“There are so many stories that haven’t been told that 
need to be,” Niforous said. “We have such a great platform 
to share these stories with the Ann Arbor community. 
Why would we not?” 
The 
story 
of 
“BARE” 
is 
one that begs 
to 
be 
heard. 
The pop opera 
follows a group 
of 
students 
at 
a 
Catholic 
boarding school 
as they grapple 
with 
issues 
of 
sexuality, 
identity 
and 
the future. Like 
its 
characters, 
“BARE” 
is 
a 
musical 
that 
strays 
from 
the 
status 
quo. Unlike similar musicals that stick to a strictly-pop 
score, “BARE”’s music is heavily influenced by rock. 
Additionally, it focuses on themes that are not often found 
in contemporary musical theatre. 
“Musical theatre in general does not have a strong 
history with LGBTQ protogatonists — let alone more than 
one,” Niforous said. 
“BARE”’s protagonists are Peter, portrayed by SMTD 
sophomore Andrew Cekala, 
and Jason, portrayed by 
SMTD sophomore Nicholas 
Kraft, two students at the 
Catholic school that have 
fallen in love with each 
other. 
Unlike 
popular 
musicals that MUSKET has 
produced in the past, such 
as “Legally Blonde” and 
“Cabaret,” “BARE” never 
made it to Broadway. 
But 
as 
Niforous 
explained “(We’re) eager to 
bring it back now. This show is more relevant than ever.” 
With themes as political as the ones present in “BARE,” 
acting in this musical has proved to be challenging. 
“Playing a character that lacks empathy is hard. As an 
actor, you have to try to empathize with the character, so 
you can still see him as a human. My character doesn’t 
wake up in the morning and say ‘Oh, I am going to be 
mean today,’ and I need to recognize that,” said freshman 
Business student Jason Donaven, who portrays the 

homophobic priest in “BARE.” 
“I never thought I would have such an emotional 
attachment to the show,” Donaven said.
It seems that he is not the only cast member to feel this 
way. 
“There have been numerous rehearsals where everyone 
in the room is crying because of how beautiful this show 
is. Even the toughest guy in the room is in tears,” said 
SMTD junior Sara Juliano, who portrays Nadia, Jason’s 
twin sister. The production team has worked to help aid 
in the emotional turmoil this show brings out in its actors. 
“Before every run all the cast and production team 
will stand in a circle and hold hands and do a breath in 
and out. And afterward we’ll do it the same way. We are 
acknowledging the people’s stories on behalf of what we’re 
telling and it’s 
for the people’s 
voices who don’t 
have an outlet 
about the specific 
story 
we’re 
telling,” Juliano 
explained. 
However, not 
all the content 
of 
“BARE” 
is 
heartbreaking. 
In fact, Juliano’s 
favorite song to 
perform in the 
show is “Plain 
Jane Fat Ass.” “It 
is fun, and I get 
to be silly! My 
character beats herself up during the song,” Juliano said. 
“She ridicules her appearance before anyone else can, 
which is something a lot of us do,” 
“Whenever you do a show, you’re excited to make 
a product and to tell the story. Getting to have this 
experience and make this story is a dream come true. I am 
just happy to be here,” Juliano said.
As far as preparing to watch the show, Juliano 
recommends 
recognizing 
that the content of the 
show is heavy. “You will be 
affected,” she said.
At a talk back after the 
Nov. 
23 
show, 
audience 
members will get a chance 
to discuss the heavy themes. 
Present at this talk will be 
director James Harbaugh 
Jr., 
music 
director 
and 
SMTD sophomore Andrew 
Gerace, SMTD Prof. Jason 
DeBord (music director for 
“Bare: The Musical”) and Reverend Matthew Lukens 
(Rev. Canterbury House). 
“I think it’s a show that begs to be talked about,” 
Niforous said. “I don’t think the curtain closes and we’re 
just done. It provokes a dialogue, and I’m excited to have 
the opportunity to open that dialogue up.” 
The stories that “BARE” brings to the table are equally 
as powerful as they are delicate. They deserve to be 
listened to. So, come listen.

In “The Scarlet Letter,” Hester Pryne and Arthur 
Dimmesdale stray from their puritanical ways to 
commit adultery by night. In “The Strange Case of 
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,” Dr. Jekyll is unassuming 
and meek during the day, but when the sun goes 
down he becomes the ominous and unhinged Mr. 
Hyde. Though both fictional, these classics reflect 
the very real human capacity for secrecy and duality. 
This quintessential literary theme of duplexity can be 
applied in the real world to the relationship between 
the U.S. government and the people, a relationship 
built on the belief that rulers will act justly. Perhaps 
we are too generous with our trust, forgetting that 
it is human nature to turn to immorality when we 
think that no one else is watching. Under the cover 
of darkness and away from society, what was once 
so clearly right or wrong suddenly becomes blurred. 
In “The Report,” director 
Scott Z. Burns explores 
this theme of light and 
dark, 
illuminating 
that 
we often lose ourselves in 
the darkness, forgetting 
that eventually the light 
will come out, and when it 
doesn’t, secrets will seep 
through the cracks and the 
truth will be exposed. 
When 
U.S. 
Senate 
employee 
Daniel 
Jones 
(Adam Driver “Paterson”) is assigned by his 
boss, Senator Dianne Feinstein (Annette Bening 
“American Beauty”), to look into a post-9/11 CIA 
interrogation program, he never could have imagined 
what he discovers. Despite Feinstein’s warnings not 
to get too emotionally invested in the investigation 
process, Jones cannot help but become enthralled 
in the disturbing and unethical methods pursued 
on suspected Al-Qaeda associates. Through Jones’s 
work, an internal war of sorts is born, when tensions 
erupt and heads butt between the Senate and the CIA. 
The more that Jones uncovers, the more entwined 
in the messy web of inter-government bureaucracy 
he becomes, as he learns that almost nothing can be 
trusted at face value and that red tape is thick.
Much of “The Report” revolves around the 

never-ending barriers to entry that exist within the 
government itself. With so many layers of authority, 
truth and morality both become problematically 
subjective. Both the Senate and the CIA have different 
sides of the story regarding what really happened 
during the interrogation program. Was the treatment 
of potential Al-Qaeda captives deemable as torture? 
Was the treatment of these captives humane? In the 
fearful, frenzied wake of 9/11, the central dispute of 
the film revolves around the perceived subjectivity 
of these questions and the breakdown of ethical 
boundaries. 
Most outstanding about the film is Adam Driver’s 
acting chops. Notorious for his quirkier roles in 
HBO’s “Girls,” Jim Jarmusch’s quiet arty flick 
“Patterson” and Spike Lee’s “BlacKkKlansman,” I 
was not expecting to see Driver portraying such a 
serious character. Nonetheless, Driver excellently 
embodies Jones bringing the same intensity that we 
can recognize in his previous roles. A serious film that 
relies minimally on music, costumes or extravagant 
cinematography, 
Driver’s 
character’s 
emotional 
reactions drive the tone 
of the film and, in a sense, 
serve as its moral compass. 
Although Jones is not the 
only one bothered by the 
cruel methods of torture 
inflicted on the suspect 
terrorist affiliates, he is 
the only one who feels 
compelled to act on it. 
While the lack of effects 
and excitement create a few lags here and there, they 
are a testament to the fact that the film’s purpose is 
not so much to entertain as it is to educate and sober 
audiences.
And the overarching theme of light and dark? 
Jones’s research facility and the torture sites 
are located below ground, shrouded in mystery 
and concealed from the light of day. Though the 
research room is used for investigation and the 
caves are intended for torture, both facilities are 
secretive, buried beneath the ground and concealed 
from the light of day and the public eye. Through 
Jones’s classified mission and the CIA’s wrongful 
torture tactics, Burns illustrates the chilling reality 
that secrecy thrives and right and wrong become 
undistinguishable when no one can see.

‘Report’: A solid unveiling
of the nightmarish truth

SAMANTHA NELSON
Daily Arts Writer

Radiohead’s fourth album, Kid A, can be called 
many things, but pleasant is not one of them. As 
the most experimental of the band’s work at the 
time of its release, the record marks the point 
when Radiohead ascended from a post-grunge 
zeitgeist to a transcendent, persisting voice for 
multiple generations of listeners. 
Of course, this reality couldn’t have been 
apparent upon Kid A’s arrival in 2000. That’s 
because it’s neither the catchiest or the most 
obviously melodious of its company, particularly 
predecessor OK Computer. It is a withholding 
tsunami of electronic spasms interwoven with 
piercing midrange guitar licks; a journey by 
canoe of crystalline caves and pulsating stars and 
depraved lonely voices set to impatient, choppy 
drums. In the case of tracks like “The National 
Anthem” and “Motion Picture Soundtrack,” all 
these sonic textures overlay grand orchestral 
compositions that explode cathartically outward. 
I’ve been unable to stay away from Kid A 
this week. Indeed, there is something about 
the clotting of snow and slush on the roads, 
that pricking feeling of cold air whooshing into 
one’s lungs that demands the detached wisdom 
of the album. Even from its first few notes, in 
that bizarrely shape-shifting synth riff which 
opens “Everything In Its Right Place,” the album 
establishes its emotional center, or rather its 
lack thereof. Chords oscillate between hope 
and dismay with discomorting frequency. This 
refusal to settle on any dimension of sensory 
clarity is everywhere in Kid A — that odd verse of 
“In Limbo” that seems to skip a beat by the time 
it repeats itself, the swingy outro of “Optimistic,” 

those creepy strings that haunt the periphery of 
“How to Disappear Completely.”
Kid A is so multi-faceted that its modest chaos 
can be off-putting. But it also has an addictive 
quality; once you’re amid the madness, you’re 
unlikely to leave it without sufficient exploration. 
And the best part about Kid A is how completely it 
rewards exploration of itself. Most obviously, the 
final track, “Untitled,” provides an incomplete 
but enriching resolution to the album’s anxieties 
over loneliness and broken communication. The 
strange combination of electronic strings and 
synths release in a single, awesome chord that 
envisions disintegration and peace as one and 
the same. 
But the album’s draw emerges from beyond 
simply a single listen. Underneath its facade of 
isolation and doubt, Kid A tucks in moments of 
warmth, the briefest of escapes into infectious 
faith. See the second half of “Motion Picture 
Soundtrack,” when the song becomes overcome 
with the plucking of multiple harps, back and 
forth across the final chorus or that strange 
baby’s cry in the closing seconds of the title track. 
Kid A is an album that heightens the feeling of 
walking through Ann Arbor’s snowy streets. 
But it alleviates its own demons with morsels 
of happiness that sustain their way through the 
entire record. 
I likely won’t stop listening to Kid A in the 
following months. The ability for an album to 
be reassuring without being trite is exceedingly 
rare for someone as cynical as I am. It is an album 
that keeps on giving, even and especially when 
its cutting bleakness is most easily accessible. 
While Kid A is not blindingly radiant enough to 
be called a beacon, it is certainly akin to a burst of 
warmth, a sip of coffee, a random reflecting light 
on the bluish-white of a snowbank.

HEY.

YOU'RE 
DOING GREAT 
AND WE 
know you 
can do it. 

Don't give up!

Over the course of the past 24 hours, I’ve 
become transfixed by a T-shirt. It’s a simple, 
oversized, 
one-size-fits-all 
cut 
with 
an 
unraveling American flag embroidered on the 
chest, contrast stitching and a skeleton design 
printed on the back. The front and back sides are 
different colors (one iteration pairs faded black 
with eggplant), both of which highlight the 
quality of the fabric and the dye itself. Kapital, 
the Okayama-based brand that makes it, offers 
the shirt through its Kountryline, which 
focuses on handmade goods and builds on a few 
key ideas, such as tie-dye, smiley face patches, 
bandana 
prints 
and 
the 
aforementioned 
skeleton motif. The company’s whimsical 
nature, backed by the arguably unmatched 
quality of its product and the recognizability of 
its perennial styles, has contributed to its cult-
like status in the menswear sphere. The shirt 
itself communicates something that I can’t 
quite put my finger on. Maybe it reckons with 
the hollowed out husk of Americana, a design 
aesthetic and an iconography steeped in mid-
century propagandic nostalgia and a certain 
ambitious naivete. Or maybe it just looks good. 
Regardless of why it speaks to me, it fits neatly 
in the space that Kapital has burrowed out for 
itself — a space that plenty of labels go out of 
their way to imitate. 
Kapital’s “secret sauce,” so to speak, is not 
that they were the first label to screen print 
a smiley face or a pile of bones on a T-shirt, 
nor is it the consistent output of quality 
craftsmanship (though it surely doesn’t hurt 
the cause). There’s a whole smattering of 
things that they do right, but chief among 
them is a strong brand identity. The company 
has spent decades articulating its philosophy 
and will continue to reap the benefits of that 
labor. To develop a self-referential oeuvre over 
a lifespan that people come back to without 
flashy marketing tactics, without trying each 
season is no small feat. It takes a community 
of creatives that know who they are and what 
they do, and it contributes to what people refer 
to as “authenticity.”
Authenticity is a fraught concept. Sounding 
it out it in my head as I type is like hearing a 
plastic spoon scrape the bottom of a styrofoam 
cup for the last pinch of soft-serve. It reminds 
me of Amazon ambassadors and corporate 
Twitter accounts trying to recreate viral 
memes. The behind-the-scenes: we’re all just 
people who could maybe be friends, and the 
big-brother-loves-you-basket 
of 
marketing 
strategies is inescapable from any viewpoint. 
To reject it and chase whatever lies at the 
opposite end of that spectrum is a tricky game 
too, though, because that grass can only get 
so green. It’s one of the reasons that brands 
with cult followings like Kapital can feel more 
like beacons than companies that operate in 

the same systems as everyone else. It’s almost 
like there’s a special crop of organizations 
that manage to fly above the closed loop of 
identity-based trade. Maybe it’s because some 
of them built themselves up before the internet 
boom (Kapital was established in 1985), or 
because some companies are so entrenched 
in 
their 
perspective 
that 
newer 
modes 
of communication don’t erode their self-
presentation. The question remains, however, 
especially in fashion: Given that there’s no 
such thing as an original idea, only new ways 
of reinterpreting existing ones, what is it that 
gives a brand authenticity or a sense of truth?
It’s a stereotypical question and a highly 
subjective one, but it lingers. It’s unanswerable, 
at least not empirically. It’s one of those things 
that just is and there’s no accounting for it 
in any tangible way. It’s one of those things 
that disappears if you pursue it, and the 
mere awareness of it creates a delicate and 
problematic game of intentions. The same can 
be said for good style, good taste and artistic 
talent. It pays to be gifted and naive. To put 
effort into one’s craft is honorable, but to put 
effort into being good, to being genuine or 
“real,” is to submit to the Euthanasia Coaster 
of public opinion, invalidating oneself in the 
process. Je ne sais quois is a condition doomed 
to permanent change. 
Kapital and brands held in a similar regard 
aren’t blithely unaware of what it means to 
produce for a prospective consumer, of course. 
There are certain stipulations that come with 
seeking to survive, but adherence to trends and 
shifting with stylistic demands of the market 
doesn’t seem to be a part of their lexicon. 
Rather, ensuring that seasonal offerings both 
meet a wide range of needs and fit in the 
evolution of their own tried and true patterns 
is paramount. 
The fashion industry can be exhausting 
to deal with. After spending my formative 
years wading through trend reports and 
wondering how designers seem to show the 
same styles and color palettes without hosting 
secret council meetings, or how cultural 
significance can be achieved without really 
bringing anything new to the table, finding 
companies with a strong sense of self is a rare 
and rewarding experience. They remind me of 
what I stand for. They also act as something to 
look to, even if those qualities can’t be attained 
in myself. As individuals, we hoard things 
we’re attracted to and cultivate an identity 
around them. There’s a constant question of 
how much of oneself is innate and how much is 
determined by experience, simply adapting to 
different environments and relationships like 
designers do to consumer demand. It’s hardly a 
question worth spending time on, as there are 
few things more transparent than striving to 
be unique. We can’t forge ourselves out of thin 
air or self-actualize in a vacuum, but we can 
take our personal experiences, our own little 
product formula and push forward.

idea of authenticity, part 1 

STYLE COLUMN

SAM KREMKE
Daily Style Columnist

Reading Susan Choi’s “Trust Exercise” is an 
exercise in itself, one that requires enormous 
amounts of patience and endurance. As an impatient 
and easily agitated person, I was almost defeated. 
The novel is a finalist for the National Book Award 
and has received critical acclaim from sources 
including The New York Times, TIME Magazine 
and The Atlantic. Naturally, my expectations 
for this novel were high, and I felt comfortable 
trusting Choi to deliver a 
transformative 
reading 
experience. Little did I 
know that “Trust Exercise” 
would utterly betray me, 
leading me to question not 
only the establishment, but 
my own sense of self as a 
reader. 
The 
first 
part 
of 
Choi’s novel explores the 
relationship 
between 
Sarah 
and 
David, 
two 
students at a performing 
arts 
high 
school, 
and 
their 
relationships 
with 
their 
fellow 
classmates 
and popular teacher, Mr. 
Kingsley. Within a few 
chapters, it becomes clear 
that the characters in this 
novel are static and boring. 
It is, frankly, difficult to 
conjure up interest in any 
of them. Sarah and David’s 
relationship is unrealistic and confusing because of 
its total lack of chemistry (even if Mr. Kingsley takes 
a creepy interest in it). Later in the first section, 
matters become complicated when a group of 
visiting drama students from England cause tension 
and rifts between the American students. Most of 
the first section of “Trust Exercise” is presented as a 
bildungsroman young adult novel. The monotonous 
narration combined with a dull plot make the 
reading process both tedious and difficult to endure. 
Midway 
through 
the novel, Choi slaps 
readers with a surprise 
shift in the narrative, 
presumably 
intended 
to offer an exciting 
re-orientation 
of 
the plot. This tactic 
may work for some 
authors, 
but 
the 
decision to uproot the 
narrative 
structure 
unintentionally comes across as a cheap attempt to 
re-invigorate the plot. In fact, it ultimately has the 
opposite effect, forcing readers to go through the 
painful process of becoming acquainted with a new 
cast of characters who are identically insufferable as 
those of the previous section. 
A criticism of “Trust Exercise” would be 
incomplete without addressing its sex scenes, one 
of the most condemning aspects of the entire novel. 
Within the first ten pages, the two main characters, 
both barely adolescents, are fondling each other in 
the middle of theater class when their teacher dims 
the lights for a demonstration. This is indicative of 
how the rest of the novel will play out, written in the 
style of a cheap romance novel one might find in a 
supermarket. Although upon further consideration, 

they are perhaps even worse. Take this passage, for 
example:
“When he jammed his tongue into her ear she 
gasped ... and twisted her head to take his tongue in her 
mouth ... She tasted the bitterness of her own earwax 
… He flailed; his dead white hairy limbs appeared 
impaled on the stem of his unaccountably wrinkly 
erection which he took in his fist and seemed to squirt 
redly at her, for he’d yanked back the covering skin.”
Somehow, the other sex scenes are arguably 
worse, one of them including a comparison of a penis 
to “a single clammy mushroom … unwholesomely 
pale and wet.” Amazingly, there is another, different 
sexual encounter that involves 
ear penetration for a second 
time. 
Not only do these parts of 
the novel make me reluctant 
to 
engage 
in 
intercourse 
ever again, they make me 
embarrassed to even inhabit 
a body. Such passages are 
objectively 
poorly 
written, 
and they are explicit in an 
exploitative way, especially in 
regards to how the scenes all 
contain elements of nonconsent 
and power imbalances in favor 
of the male characters. In 
simpler terms, these sex scenes 
are akin to rape fantasies, and 
are made even more disturbing 
when one remembers that 
the most intense ones largely 
involve intercourse between 
adolescents, further adding to 
their exploitative undertones. 
Several 
reviewers 
have 
characterized “Trust Exercise” to be a nod to the 
#MeToo movement, specifically in regards to 
the many scenarios of young women being taken 
advantage of by older and more powerful men. But 
the simplistic depictions of male aggressors as clear-
cut antagonists, characterizations devoid of any 
nuance, detracts from whatever commentary she 
hopes to make. It is obvious who is the “bad guy;” 
there is no subtlety or critical thinking involved 
in examining these power imbalances and their 
implications. 
“Trust 
Exercise” 
nearly broke me. Other 
readers have gushed 
about an inability to put 
the book down because 
they were so invested in 
the pace of the story, or 
were so riveted by the 
complex characters and 
engaging plot that they 
were undeterred by the 
novel’s graphic depictions of sexual encounters and 
harassment. My experience with this novel, on the 
other hand, forced me to question if I was lacking 
the level of intelligence required to fully appreciate 
the apparently sacrosanct text. 
But then I looked down at my open book and 
glimpsed the underlined phrase, “a single clammy 
mushroom” and thought, well, perhaps this novel 
is an exercise in trusting oneself. Of being able 
to hold an opinion and know when something is 
objectively bad — even when higher powers claim 
the opposite. Perhaps this is the transformative 
reading experience I had initially hoped for, though 
in an unintended sense of the term. Either way, two 
things are clear: Do not trust the establishment, and 
do not trust Susan Choi.

Harry Styles is back with his new, honeyed 
single “Watermelon Sugar,” and now he has 
high-waisted pants up to his nipples. No one 
is mad about it. Nay, the pants to the nipples 
heighten excitement for the album in the 
same way the steamy nature of his “Lights 
Up” video sent fans into hysteria. The cotton 
candy vibes of “Watermelon Sugar” induce 
a similar frenzy, but one where fans are 
running to find a lollipop to suck on. 
“Watermelon Sugar” debuted Nov. 16 on 
“Saturday Night Live,” a surprise release in 
anticipation of Styles’s sophomore album 
Fine Line, coming Dec. 13. The repetition of 
lyrics “watermelon sugar” and the catchy 
strumming pattern of the electric guitar 
emulate the optimism that Styles has brought 
to the table in his album promo (how could 
one not be optimistic about Harry Styles 
smiling in a pink ballerina outfit, which he 
used to preface his “SNL” appearance?). 
“Watermelon Sugar” emanates what is 
voluptuous — this sexy tale of summer love 

shines bright. 
Billie Eilish also released a new single this 
week, her first since her March 2019 debut 
album When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We 
Go? “everything i wanted” details a dream 
Eilish had where she commits suicide, and 
amid the fame no one cares that she is gone. 
The cover art features an abstract painting 
of the Golden Gate Bridge, one of the most 
popular spots for suicide. Most importantly, 
the single showcases the enduring safe haven 
of a relationship she has with her older 
brother, co-writer and producer, Finneas. 
Eilish’s new single feels like an extension 
of her debut album, as she sticks with eerie 
vocals and an otherworldly investigation of 
dreams. She continues to use a metaphysical 
dimension to comment on her waking life. 
Her sweet spot — mental health, sleep, 
relationships and that which haunts us — 
continues to paint a vivid landscape, braiding 
the same threads as she did on her debut 
album. Even though she sticks with the same 
themes, Eilish creates a misty soundscape, as 
if we’re standing on the Golden Gate Bridge 
with her and holding her back, loving on her 
until she wakes up from the nightmare.

Lockwood making impact while hurt

Four rows from the ice at Munn 
Ice Arena, Will Lockwood laid 
back in his chair, forced to watch 
the game, once again, through the 
glass and from the stands. 
To his immediate left and 
right sat other teammates, extra 
players who weren’t dressing. 
But being grouped with fellow 
teammates who couldn’t make an 
impact wasn’t where Lockwood 
wanted to be.
Where he really wanted to be 
was a section over — where the 
visitor’s bench was filled with 
the remaining Michigan hockey 
players as they prepared for the 
Michigan State matchup.
He watched his teammates 
warmed up without him for the 
third straight game. He watched 
alternate captain Luke Martin 
skate over to the referees and 
shake hands — a role normally 
reserved for Lockwood. 
And as he watched the puck 
drop and the battle between the 
two teams begin, that’s when it 
hit him. 
He’d 
lived 
this 
before, 
watching his teammates take the 
ice while he looked on from the 
sidelines. Lockwood missed the 
second half of his sophomore year 
due to a shoulder injury that kept 
him from his team’s run to the 
Frozen Four.
Back then, he felt resentment, 
unsatisfied by the defined success 
he was not a part of. But now, as 
senior captain, the emotions of 
being sidelined hit harder.
“I hate it,” Lockwood said. 
“I absolutely hate it, I go to the 
games and it’s really hard to 
watch especially when the team’s 
not doing well. I feel like I could 
be out there making an impact for 
my teammates.”
Unlike two years ago, Michigan 
needs his impact. Through six 
Big Ten games, the Wolverines 
have managed to earn only one 
conference point and sit 14 points 
behind first-place Penn State.
The 
struggles 
have 
been 
capped by a lack of offense, 

which, as a natural goal scorer, is 
where Lockwood’s impact would 
lie. Last year, Lockwood lead the 
team in scoring with 16 goals. 
This year, he’s tied for the lead 
with three despite missing the 
last three games. 
“It’s 
hard 
on 
Will,” 
said 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson. 
“He’s really disappointed that he’s 
not in the battle with his friends 
and his teammates. I know it’d be 
nice to have our leading returning 
goal scorer in. But you can’t use 
that as an excuse. We have to find 
ways to win hockey games, but I 
know it’s tough on Will.”
Last 
Saturday’s 
loss 
was 
particularly hard for Lockwood 
to watch. Sitting in the stands, he 
couldn’t do anything but watch as 
his team surrendered a goal in the 
opening two minutes of the first 
period. He slid a little deeper into 
his chair. 
And being in Munn Ice Arena 
presented a unique challenge for 
him. Before the game, a throng of 
familiar faces came to greet him 
before settling down and sitting 
in adjacent seats. In addition, 
friends and family not only of his 
own but his teammates’ as well 
began to surround his seat. The 
noise and distractions naturally 
followed. But Lockwood wanted 
his full attention to be on the 
Wolverines on the ice. 
So, 
when 
he 
disappeared 
from sight after a period, it was 
apparent where he was going. He 
found a different point of view to 
watch from.
“Well, I was sitting in the 
stands,” Lockwood said. “And 
I couldn’t really focus on the 

game. I actually went over to the 
zamboni doors and watched for a 
little bit. Then I watched the third 
(period) from the bench to have 
the best view of the game and as 
little distraction as possible.”
His dedication to the team 
didn’t end with him playing 
pseudo-equipment 
manager 
behind the bench for a period. 
During 
the 
intermission, 
he 
followed the team into the locker 
room and addressed them.
“I just told the team we have to 
be a hard team to play against,” 
Lockwood said. “It’s a rivalry 
game. I thought a lot of guys 
worked really hard. I don’t think 
that’s exactly our issue. I think 
when you’re playing in a game like 
that, you’ve kind of got to have a 
chip on your shoulder. And play 
towards that rivalry. But have a 
bit of a chip on our shoulder and 
a bit of an ego during the game.” 
This weekend, he’ll return to 
the lineup and skate alongside 
his linemates, freshman forward 
Johnny Beecher and sophomore 
forward Jimmy Lambert. Having 
Lockwood back is no instant fix 
for Michigan’s offensive woes, 
but his presence can only help. 
The Wolverines need Lockwood. 
Shifting from the stands 
to the zamboni doors to the 
tunnel leading to the bench, 
Lockwood, 
inch 
by 
inch, 
worked his way back to his 
team.
As his health followed the 
same 
gradual 
progression, 
the team couldn’t be more 
ready for him to be back. And 
Lockwood’s ready to prove 
that he returned for a reason.

Michigan ready for Notre Dame test

After reaching the second round 
of the NCAA Tournament each of 
the past two seasons, the Michigan 
women’s basketball team has 
high expectations for the 2019-20 
season, highlighted by a program 
goal of making it to the Sweet 
Sixteen.
The 
Wolverines 
will 
have 
the chance to notch their first 
high-profile victory on Saturday 
against Notre Dame after opening 
the season with four games 
against 
mid-major 
opponents. 
The Fighting Irish aren’t the 
powerhouse that made seven of the 
last nine Final Fours — they have 
opened the season 3-2, with home 
losses to No. 15 Michigan State and 
No. 23 Tennessee — but Michigan 
isn’t taking last year’s NCAA 
Tournament runner-up lightly.
“That’s a game for us that we 
circle on our schedule regardless 
of how great their start was this 
year,” said Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico. “I know right now, 
their record is not what they want 
it to be, but their schedule has 
been incredibly difficult and they 
graduated everyone that really 
contributed on that Final Four 
team last year.”
Despite losing all five starters 
from a season ago — and its top five 
scorers — Notre Dame’s roster is 
far from barren. Its starting lineup 
consists of three top-25 recruits 
from the past two seasons in 
forward Sam Brunelle and guards 

Katlyn Gilbert and Anaya Peoples, 
and two graduate transfers — 
Marta Sniezek from Stanford 
and Destinee Walker from North 
Carolina. These five could cause 
trouble for the Wolverines because 
of the mismatches they create 
— four are guards, and the only 
forward, Brunelle, has attempted 
40 3-pointers this season.
“It’s gonna be a tough matchup 
because their ‘4’ and ‘5’ are really 
guards, and they’re gonna face-
up, they’re gonna try to take you 
off the bounce,” Barnes Arico said. 
“We gotta constantly be moving 
… because we’re gonna have our 
posts match up with guards, and 
that’s gonna be difficult at times.”
While these mismatches could 
create trouble on the defensive 
end, Notre Dame’s lack of size 
plays right into Michigan’s biggest 
strength 
offensively: 
interior 
scoring.
“As tough as it’s gonna be for 
us to defend them because they 
don’t really have any true posts, 
it’s gonna be a challenge for 
them to defend us,” Barnes Arico 
said. “I think Naz (Hillmon) is 
playing exceptionally well inside. 
I think Izabel Varejão gives them 
something that they don’t have, a 
6-foot-5 post. How are they gonna 
defend that? How are they gonna 
defend Naz’s strength inside? So I 
think they’re gonna have matchup 
problems with us as well.”
The 
Wolverines 
will 
also 
need to clean up their offensive 
play in order to limit fast-break 
opportunities for the Fighting 

Irish. Michigan got away with 
turning the ball over 61 times over 
four games and giving up double-
digit points off turnovers in each of 
its last two games. 
Barnes 
Arico 
identified 
transition defense as an area 
needing 
improvement. 
The 
Fighting Irish have scored double-
digit points off turnovers in 
each of their five games despite 
shooting under 50 percent in all of 
them. Allowing them to get out in 
transition often could spell trouble 
for the Wolverines.
Michigan can alleviate some 
of 
Notre 
Dame’s 
transition 
offense with strong play on the 
offensive glass. The Wolverines are 
averaging more than 10 offensive 
rebounds per game, and their 
clear size advantage should give 
them many second-chance scoring 
opportunities.
Michigan has a relatively young 
team, but the majority of its players 
were there last season, when the 
Wolverines played three games 
against two top-10 teams — two 
against Maryland and one against 
Louisville.
In particular, their two young 
stars 
clearly 
showed 
growth 
between their first and second 
matchups against the Terrapins. 
Hillmon’s scoring total greatly 
improved, and sophomore guard 
Amy Dilk tallied 11 assists and 
shot more efficiently as Michigan 
lost by one, giving the Wolverines 
optimism that their best players 
will step up in their biggest game 
so far this season.

May Day!

EAST LANSING — On Jam 
the Jenison (Fieldhouse) night, 
Sparty, the ear-wrenching Spartan 
marching band and screaming 
Spartan fans united to make 
Wednesday’s game as hard as they 
could for the Michigan volleyball 
team. But amid the noise and five 
sets later, the Wolverines prevailed 
in 
a 
contested 
rivalry battle in 
East Lansing. 
“Their 
crowd 
is 
huge 
and 
their 
band 
is 
excruciatingly 
loud, 
but 
it’s 
amazing 
— 
it’s 
so 
much 
fun 
for 
them,” 
said 
freshman outside 
hitter 
May 
Pertofsky. 
The No. 23 Wolverines (19-8 
overall, 12-5 Big Ten) fended off 
the Spartans (14-13 overall, 5-12 
Big Ten) in five sets. Michigan 
won its fourth game against all 
its rivals this season, and added a 
fifth consecutive win against the 
Spartans. 
The match started off slow 
as Michigan found themselves 
down 
2-1 
after 
three 
sets. 
Sloppy defensive play and a 
lack of communication hurt the 
Wolverines in the second and 
third sets. An increased pressure 
in serves for Michigan State 
added to Michigan’s struggles. 
In a rivalry game, the pressure 
only builds on the opposing team, 
especially if they are away, like the 
Wolverines were. 
“Going down 2-1, it becomes 
go-time,” 
said 
senior 
setter 
MacKenzi Welsh. “If you don’t 
play your best in that moment, 
you’re going to lose the match. 
… Taking that negative pressure 
and just using that to play to the 
best of your ability, and know 
that the game is on the line in that 
moment.”
After hitting .276 in the first 
three sets, the Wolverines came 
back to hit .351 in the final two 
sets. Michigan calmed down and 
played a sound game that drove 

them to a narrow victory.
“We looked nervous. We looked 
emotional,” said Michigan coach 
Mark Rosen. “We were just a 
little frantic … and we just needed 
to relax and settle into our own 
game. I can’t blame them. It’s a big 
environment. It’s a rivalry game.”
The win itself was impressive 
and certainly one to remember, 
but two key players had great 
milestones. First, Welsh hit the 
5,000-assist 
mark.
“It feels pretty 
cool, and I know 
it’s 
a 
really 
cool 
lifetime 
achievement,” 
Welsh 
said. 
“I 
know 
I 
wouldn’t be able 
to without all 
my hitters and 
everyone on my 
team and I’m really thankful that I 
have the support system that I do.”
Pertofsky notched a career-
high 18 kills in a single match, 

but when asked about the record, 
she had no knowledge of it, and 
selflessly deferred credit to her 
teammates.
“Throughout the game, we just 
kind of all looked at each other 
and held each other accountable,” 
Pertofsky said. “We were like 
‘Hey guys, we need to calm each 
other down and we need to play 
for each other and play as a team 
and love each other.’ It’s a family. 
We can’t be against each other 
now, so we always started playing 
together and it came together very 
beautifully.”
Michigan 
played 
far 
from 
perfect, but came together and 
won a difficult game in a tough 
environment.
“Really proud of how they 
fought when they weren’t playing 
their best,” Rosen said. “Tiger 
Woods used to always use the 
thing that you have to be able to 
win with your B and C game … you 
can’t always have your A-game. 
We’d like it but doesn’t always 
happen.”

EAST 
LANSING 
— 
Sophomore 
outside 
hitter 
Paige Jones and senior setter 
MacKenzi Welsh both stood 
frozen as the ball dropped 
between them. A last-second 
reaction 
by 
Welsh 
wasn’t 
enough to save the ball and 
prevent the Spartans from 
tying up the set. The entire 
band 
played 
the 
Michigan 
State fight song, drowning out 
any other sound that wanted to 
be heard inside the fieldhouse.
The event known in East 
Lansing 
as 
“Jam 
Jenison” 
fostered communication issues 
for No. 23 Michigan (19-8 
overall, 12-5 Big Ten), which it 
ultimately overcame to defeat 
the rival Spartans (14-13, 5-12) 
in five sets Wednesday night.
The Wolverines came out 
after just one day of practice 
this week into a rival’s home 
court, with the seats filled and 

decibels raised.
“Everyone felt kind of shaky,” 
said freshman outside hitter 
May Pertofsky. “Obviously 
their crowd is huge and their 
band is excruciatingly loud. ... 
I think it just kind of threw us 
for a loop for a second because 
we’ve only been in the gym 
once before this game”
And 
this 
was 
visible. 
Michigan was making errors 
on both sides 
of 
the 
ball, 
hesitating 
on 
who 
would 
take 
the 
second hits and 
even 
sending 
sets 
above 
teammates’ 
heads. 
It 
stemmed from 
one main issue 

— communication.
“It 
is 
a 
little 
hard 
to 
communicate,” said Michigan 
coach 
Mark 
Rosen. 
“So 

there’s 
going 
to 
be 
some 
communication issues because 
you can’t hear. … We can’t 
really be visual with our 
communication because you’re 
watching the ball, so you can’t 
really take your eye off the ball 
and look at them, so it got a 
little bit crazy that way.”
And to Rosen, it was obvious 
where at least some of the 
issues started. The whole pep 
band was there 
and 
the 
noise 
reverberated 
throughout 
the 
arena.
“The 
band 
makes 
a 
big 
difference,” 
Rosen said.
After 
falling 
into a 2-1 set 
deficit following 
repeated errors, 
the 
Wolverines 
regained 
control of the match.
“I feel like going down, 2-1, it 
becomes go-time,” Welsh said. 
“And if you don’t play your best 
in that moment you’re going to 
lose the match.”
Despite 
the 
desperation, 
Michigan was visibly more 
calm and in control of their 
play in the fourth and fifth 
sets. 
“We would come into the 
time out and they’d look at us 
and (the coaches) wouldn’t 
be upset or anything like 
that,” Pertofsky said. “They 
would just be like, ‘Guys, 
you need to calm down and 
you need to unify.’ After that 
we came out with a lot more 
fire and just talked more and 
communicated.”
The Wolverines were able to 
close out the last two sets, 25-15 
and 17-15, respectively, despite 
the crowd growing louder than 
before. With the tight, 3-2, 
victory over Michigan State, 
Michigan finishes its regular 
season with a 4-0 record over 
rivals Michigan State and Ohio 
State.
“With our backs against the 
wall, in a place like this, I was 
really proud of how our team 
responded,” Rosen said.

How Juwan Howard’s push for faster pace of play has affected Jon Teske

Jon Teske is a busy man these 
days. 
As the starting center for the 
Michigan men’s basketball team, 
Teske has done it all so far this 
season. Through three games, the 
7-foot-1, 265-pounder has played 
93 minutes and averaged 16.7 
points, nine rebounds, 2.7 blocks 
and shot 55.9 percent from the 
field. 
Teske has developed from only 
playing 61 minutes as a sophomore 
into one of the Wolverines’ most 
reliable players and one of the 
best bigs in the conference. 
Even during his time as an 
assistant coach for the Miami 
Heat, 
now-Michigan 
coach 
Juwan Howard admired Teske’s 
game from afar. Now, under 
Howard’s tutelage, the hope is 
Teske takes another leap as a 
senior. 
“With Jon, his game has 
improved year by year,” Howard 

said after the Wolverines’ 70-50 
win over Elon on Friday night. 
“He played a lot away from the 
basket so when I got the job here, 
I was like, ‘I want to utilize his 
post presence.’ He embraced it. 
We worked on it this summer. 
We’re gonna use him in that post, 
as well as from the outside.” 
So far, it’s gone according to 
plan. It’s still early and Michigan 
has yet to enter the meat of its 
schedule, but Teske has asserted 
himself both offensively and 
defensively. No one has been able 
to challenge Teske in the paint 
and while his perimeter shooting 
isn’t on par with last year’s 
percentages, opposing teams are 
still forced to respect his range. 
In addition to focusing more 
on Teske’s post game, Howard’s 
emphasis on up-tempo, transition 
offense has also benefited Teske’s 
statline. He was already a capable 
rim-runner for his size, but the 
Wolverines’ quick pace highlights 
that aspect of Teske’s game and 
has made for an entertaining 
brand of basketball. 

“Everyone can run the floor,” 
said sophomore guard David 
DeJulius. “Even (Teske), he’s 
7-foot-1, is running and beating 
guys up the floor. It feels real 
good, once I get the rebound, I 
push it out to (Zavier Simpson). 
Zavier takes two dribbles and 
then throws the lob to Jon. Just 
the atmosphere, it’s very fun 
basketball. Not just for us, but 
also for the spectators.” 
With 
that 
said, 
Howard’s 
offensive philosophy does have a 
downside: It wears on his team. 
Teske specifically has looked 
visibly winded after spurts of 
transition offense. 
With little frontcourt depth 
though, Michigan can’t really 
afford to have him not on the 
floor. Sophomore forwards Colin 
Castleton and Brandon Johns Jr. 
provide some length off the bench 
but are too inconsistent to rely on 
for long periods of time. Redshirt 
junior center Austin Davis has 
some experience, having played 
in some important games under 
John Beilein, but doesn’t appear 

to be a go-to option for Howard. 
Against Creighton, the best 
team the Wolverines have faced 
and another fast-paced offense, 
Howard had to replace Teske 
seven minutes into the game due 
to fatigue. 
“Big fella was working hard,” 
Howard said after the Bluejays 
game on Nov. 12. “Big Jon at times 
got a little tired. You’re playing 
against a team who plays with 
pace. They loved to get up and 
down in transition. They also 
shoot threes in transition and 
want to put our ‘5s’ in a lot of ball-
screens, to make them guard. It’s 
a lot of movement.”
Going forward, Michigan will 
have to grapple with the fact 
that a play style that accentuates 
some of Teske’s best qualities 
may also pose problems for him 
later in games. As of now, the lack 
of reliable length behind Teske 
— and his stellar performances 
— means the more he plays, the 
better.
In up-tempo games though, 
that’ll surely be a balancing act. 

Why has the Wolverines’ offense 
clicked? It’s all in the little things

Over the last month, as 
Michigan’s offense has rounded 
into shape — finally starting 
to look like the high-powered 
machine that was promised 
during the offseason and what 
it so plainly wasn’t during the 
season’s first five weeks — the 
explanations from the program 
have been simple.
Better execution. A lack of 
turnovers. The natural learning 
curve that comes with a new 
offense over the course of the 
season.
It’s not rocket science, or 
even a wholesale change on 
coordinator Josh Gattis’ part, 
to hear the Wolverines tell it. 
Merely, it’s just the little things.
“Just playing good. Playing 
better,” said running backs coach 
Jay Harbaugh. “I think steadily 
over the course of the year, 
we’ve gotten better and better 
and cleaned things up that were 
— things that weren’t going our 
way early, whether it be taking 
care of the ball or just being 
assignment-sound. 
“Gradually as we’ve gone on, 
individuals have gotten better. 
The units, the running backs, the 
line, receivers, the quarterbacks. 
Everyone’s kinda elevating their 
play, and you’re just seeing that 

happen here at the end of the 
season, what it looks like when a 
bunch of different individuals do 
it together.”
During the early part of the 
year, when the offense couldn’t 
get started against the likes of 
Army, Wisconsin and Iowa, 
Michigan couldn’t seem to stop 
fumbling. After an Oct. 12 win at 
Illinois in which the Wolverines 
nearly let the Illini claw back 
after jumping out to a seemingly 
decisive lead, Michigan led the 
nation with 17 fumbles. Senior 
quarterback 
Shea 
Patterson, 
dealing with an oblique injury, 
seemed reluctant to run the ball. 
The offense itself didn’t run 
smoothly.
Since the following week, 
when 
the 
Wolverines 
came 
tantalizingly close to a comeback 
at Penn State, all of that has 
shifted. In the last 14 quarters, 
they’ve 
scored 
141 
points, 
including blowing the doors off 
rivals Notre Dame and Michigan 
State. Patterson has made use 
of his legs like he did in 2018, 
keeping zone-read looks when 
defensive ends have overplayed 
the run and forcing them to 
acknowledge the threat. And 
Michigan has lost just one 
fumble, which came toward the 
end of a blowout win.
It’s undeniable that certain 
tweaks have been made in the 

offense — that much is plain 
for any onlooker to see. But the 
little things, those that don’t 
come through Gattis’ headset 
on Saturday, are what seem to 
matter most.
“A lot of people say the Penn 
State game (was when things 
changed), second half, and I 
think it definitely started there 
for sure,” said senior tight end 
Sean 
McKeon 
on 
Monday. 
“Kinda just eliminating all the 
turnovers was a big thing. Really 
being able to finish drives with a 
kick, like coach Harbaugh says, 
either a punt, field goal or extra 
point.”
Senior left tackle Jon Runyan 
Jr. was asked Monday if the 
preseason characterization of 
the offense — that it would walk 
into the opener against Middle 
Tennessee State ready to light 
the world on fire — was unfair in 
retrospect. He didn’t give a yes or 
no, but noted that an adjustment 
period was needed. He didn’t 
need to add that those outside 
the building weren’t particularly 
willing to acknowledge that at 
the time.
Now, though, it’s obvious not 
only that an adjustment period 
was needed, but that it has 
passed. The Wolverines moved 
the ball on Michigan State with 
ease last Saturday, scoring 44 
points and finishing with 470 
yards. They ended every drive 
but two with a kick, and things 
have looked that way for nearly a 
full month of games.
It’s not what people envisioned 
in August. But it bodes well 
nonetheless.
“It’s a little bit expected to 
get better as the course of the 
year goes,” Jay Harbaugh said. 
“Obviously you’d like to do that 
from the get-go and play your 
best, but unfortunately that’s not 
how it goes all the time. 
“You’re always gonna start 
somewhere and graduate, gotta 
build from there.”

Danna making the most of his chance

Michael Danna had never 
experienced anything close to 
this, running out on the field for 
one of the best-known rivalry 
games in college football, helping 
his team blow that rival to bits 
and hoisting the Paul Bunyan 
Trophy up in the Michigan 
Stadium end zone.
These were the moments 
Danna — who spent the first four 
years of his career at Central 
Michigan before joining the 
Michigan football team as a 
grad transfer — came here for. 
The moments Danna will never 
forget.
And as they’ve come, Danna 
has taken the time to absorb 
them. Even the biggest NFL-
bound stars usually get three 
years at a school. Danna got one. 
He’s known since he got to Ann 
Arbor that he has to embrace 
every last second before they slip 
through his fingers.
“I feel like I just got here and 
it’s coming to the end,” Danna 
said Tuesday. “But it’s been the 
blink of an eye and it’s already 
the end of November and I’m just 
trying to make the most of every 
opportunity I get being here.”
Danna still talks to his friends 
with the Chippewas and has 
been following their quest for a 
MAC West title. But he has no 
regrets of leaving the place that 
was home for four years — after 
all, with the Wolverines, he’s 
gotten to play on the biggest 
stage.
Beyond that, he’s upped his 
game and proved he belongs in 
the Big Ten. When asked in what 
area he’d improved the most, 
Danna listed off the two aspects 
of being a good defensive end: 
pass rush and run stopping. At 
Central Michigan, he played 
almost exclusively as an edge 
rusher. With the Wolverines, 
he’s done that in addition to 
2-technique, 3-technique and 
5-technique as part of a four-
defensive end package defensive 

coordinator Don Brown designed 
because of the wealth of pass-
rushing talent.
Though Danna comes off 
the bench, he’s become even 
more useful simply because 
he’s developed that versatility. 
Coaches know he can play 
anywhere. So they find a spot for 
him.
“Everyone thought he was a 
pass-rusher only, so (impressed 
with) 
how 
he’s 
handled the run 
game and the role 
that he’s played,” 
said defensive line 
coach Shaun Nua 
on 
Wednesday. 
“It’s hard to not 
start and just go in 
there cold.”
He later added: 
“Anytime 
you 
have a great player 
like Mike Danna, you can’t leave 
him on the sidelines.”
Danna’s bright-eyed attitude 
has been key in his ability to 
step in seamlessly. This is his 
only shot, so he can’t miss out 
on anything. Because of it, he’s 
worked that much harder. When 
he first arrived in the offseason, 
Danna got to work in the weight 
room, and others noticed. They 
knew someone with that kind of 
effort would fit right in as one of 
them.
“It’s not easy because you’re 
coming in, first you’re leaving a 

family you have in terms of the 
last team he was with,” Nua said. 
“And then a different culture 
there, adjust to a new culture, 
whatever it is, it’s not easy to 
go in and just be accepted, be 
welcomed with open arms but 
that kid’s attitude is — that young 
man’s attitude is special.”
Since he got to Michigan, 
Danna hasn’t worried about 
tomorrow. He hasn’t worried 
about 
next 
week. He hasn’t 
worried about 
anything 
but 
the 
seconds 
unfolding 
in 
front of him. 
It’s a mentality 
that’s 
allowed 
him to carve 
out a role even 
among a glut of 
pass-rushers — 
the 30 total tackles, three tackles 
for loss, three sacks, a forced 
fumble and two quarterback 
hurries speak to that.
And as the moments come 
and go, one thing is for certain: 
Danna will cherish every one.
“Gratitude is a very special 
thing, and that’s exactly what 
Mike Danna has,” Nua said. “He 
appreciates every single second 
that he gets, every little moment 
that we go through, good or bad. 
And he learns fast from it.
“I just wish I had him for four 
more years.”
