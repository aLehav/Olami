"Our spirit was being broken," Four years after running on

a pledge to reinvent Michigan's
economy, Snyder was able to
secure a second term largely
on his fulfillment of that prom-
ise. His supporters point to his
hands-on approach to Detroit's
recovery as a signature accom-
plishment of his first term. The
state legislature, the city and its
creditors and pensioners struck
a Grand Bargain that allowed
the city to move ahead with its
bankruptcy proceedings, which
will wrap up this month.
On higher education, Snyder
cut state funding in 2011 with
the promise to raise it again in
subsequent years. He has incre-
mentally increased the funding
but has yet to return it to the 2011
levels. Consequently, Schauer
attempted to brand himself as
the "education governor" in his
campaign, calling for its funding
to be restored to pre-2011 levels
upon election to office.
In terms of the statewide

Daily StaffReporter
U.S. House Rep. Gary Peters
(D-Detroit) will be the next
U.S Senator from Michigan.
Peters, who hasserved inthe
U.S House of Representatives
for five years, faced off against
Terri -Lynn Land, former
Michigan Secretary of State.
The race was called by CNN
and the Detroit Free Press at 9
p.m, and as of press time early
Wednesday morning with 95
percent of precincts reporting,
Peters led Land 55 percent to
41 percent.
Minutes after Peters' pro-
jected win was announced,
Land called Peters to concede.
She did not release a statement,
talk to the press or speak to
the Republican watch party in

Detroit following her conces-
sion.
Peters will succeed fellow
Democrat Carl Levin, who has
served in the U.S. Senate for
more than 35 years. The seat
was originally expected to be
hotly contested and potentially
a key race to determine which
party would be the overall
majority in the Senate.
However, Peters, who main-
tained a slight lead in the polls
over Land throughout much
of the general election season,
pulled away from his opponent
significantly by the last quar-
ter of the race to a double-digit
lead.
"Michigan was obviously a
squandered opportunity for
the Republicans," Political
Science Prof. Michael Trau-
gott said Tuesday night. "Her
campaign got off to a bad start
because of the initial interac-
tion with the media, so her
campaign team decided to
hide her from reporters and
restricted her access to voters
at public events, so she never

Third consecutive
Dingell to serve in
Congress
By GENEVIVE HUMMER
and SHOHAM GEVA
Daily StaffReporters
The Dingell dynasty will con-
tinue. In the 12th U.S. House
District, the Detroit Free Press
has called the race for Debbie
Dingell, wife of current U.S.
House Rep. John Dingell (D).
She is the third Dingell to hold
a Michigan Congressional seat,
following current. Rep. John
Dingell and his father, John
Dingell, Sr.
In a victory speech at the state
Democrat watch party Tuesday
night in Detroit, Dingell thanked
her staff, family and campaign,
and said there were two people
she wanted to thank specifically
by name: her husband, outgoing
H-S

Rep. Dingell, and outgoing U.S
Senator Carl Levin.
"These Democrats, two giants
of men...have served this state
a very very long time," she said.
"And what we have to remember
is that they've been the voice of
Michigan's values, of respecting
working men and women and
standing firm for what's right."
Dingell faced off against
Republican candidate Terry
Bowman, a Ford employee and
key player in the 2012 right-
to-work battle in the state. She
made higher education, namely
reducing student debt, a key
focus, hosting higher educa-
tion roundtables at universities
across the state to discuss issues
facing students and universities.
Dingell, who serves as a trust-
ee at Wayne State University
recently voted against a tuition
increase at that institution.
"I've been on the Wayne State
board for eight years," Dingell
said in a June interview with
5-m

The Michigan Daily. "Every sin-
gle year, it seems like it's becom-
ing more challenging and more
difficult and harder to afford
a higher education. And every
single day, I am meeting young
people who are graduating with
staggering debt."
A founder of the National
Women's Health Resource
Center, Dingell also champi-
oned affordable health care and
investing in health research that
includes women, and advocated
for policies that extend rights to
same-sex couples.
"If two people love each other,
why should we keep them from
being with each other?" Ding-
ell said in an October interview
with The Michigan Daily.
In her victory speech Tues-
day night, Dingell touched on all
those areas, also emphasizing
job creation in the state.
"We're going to keep fighting
ahead for the values we all care
about- to protect manufactur-
ing, that if you are sick you don't
worry about whether you need
to go to a doctor," she said. "And
that our children, 25 percent of
our population and 100 percent
of our future, they deserve qual-
ity, affordable education. That's
what I'm fighting for. That's
what I stand here for tonight."
In a October interview with
the Daily, she said the 2008
financial crash heavily impacted
the job market, which, unlike
the auto industry, has not recov-
ered. Dingell has highlighted the
importance of job creation espe-
cially for young college gradu-
ates and those forced into early
retirement.
In an October interview with
The Michigan Daily, Bowman
emphasized his distance from
Washington as one benefit of
him taking the congressional
seat.
"It's no fault of the individual,
but I think that if you're in Con-
gress for a long time you com-
pletely lose the ability to connect
with what goes on each and
every day," he said.

Republicans has attempted to protect the
state's ban on same-sex mar-
maintain hold in riage and its ban on affirmative
executive office action.

Linden, her challenger, was
not available to media during
the campaign.
Michigan House
of Representatives
State representative Jeff
Irwin (D-Ann Arbor) has won
reelection for a third term,
defeating Republican challeng-
er John Spisak.
Irwin has pushed for greater
state involvement in all levels
of education and has argued
that improving the state's edu-
cational institutions can be a
means of economic growth. In
April 2013, Irwin proposed a
bill to extend in-state tuition
equality to undocumented
students, a move hailed by on-
campus student groups.
"I think it's good state pol-
icy to try to keep those people
here in Michigan, giving them
opportunity to contribute to
our economy and communi-
ties," Irwin said in a 2013 inter-
view with the Daily.
He has also been an advo-
cate for improved environ-
mental protections, and
supports increased investment
in infrastructure to aid eco-
nomic recovery.
Spisak, an Ann Arbor resi-
dent, is a stay-at-home father
who previously owned small
businesses. He prioritized
investing in roads, bridges and
other infrastructure. He also
campaigned to better educa-
tion.
Daily News Editor Rachel
Premack and Daily StaffReport-
ers Ben Atlas, Shoham Geva and
Genevieve Hummer contributed
to this report.

"I will continue to serve as
a voice for the constitution,
because there are cops and
firefighters who worked hard
in a tough city whose pensions
were at risk," Schuette said in a
speech at the Renaissance Cen-
ter Tuesday night.
"I am an optimist at the core,
and this election is all about
tomorrows," Schuette said. "I
am confident Michigan's best
tomorrows are just ahead. "
Schuette, who outspent Tot-
ten by a near six-to-one margin
during the campaign, has said
he would like to be a "voice for
victims" of all crimes in his
second term.
Formerly a federal pros-
ecutor, Totten emphasized his
desire to protect Michigan citi-
zens from economic crime. He
also aimed to better support
women's and students' rights,
two areas in which he said
Schuette failed.
In his first term, Schuette

Michigan State Senate
State Sen. Rebekah Warren
(D-Ann Arbor) won her second
term over Republican challeng-
er Terry Linden.
Warren has served Ann
Arbor as a state senator since
2011. Previously, Warren
served in the Michigan House
of Representatives from 2007
to 2010.
In her tenure, Warren has
focused on women's rights and
environmental protection. In
September, she co-introduced
legislation to require all health
insurance companies to pro-
vide the option to purchase
abortion service coverage. She
has also sponsored legislation
to help sexual assault survi-
vors, gender pay equity and
works to extend workplace
family medical leave.
Warren is invested in
improving the environment. In

Inclusive language, only part of the solution

When I abandoned beauty for strength

started weightlifting for all the
wrong reasons.
I heard it will give me
the toned look
of Gisele.
I heard it will
give me the ass
of J. Lo.
I heard it
will give me
the arms of
Jennifer Aniston.
I heard it AWA
will give me the TOSIC
slender legs of
Heidi Klum.
I heard it will give me the flat abs
of Rihanna.
I heard it will give me a body
other than my own.
A year ago, I listened to the
magazines, movies, celebrities,
friends and family that told me
exercise could move my body far
away from its current form. I pored
over the advice and tips that detailed
how to lift small weights to achieve
the beauty ideal of the perfect
female celebrity. They all directed
me toward the same end goal - thin
and toned. Alone with these voices,
I had become fogged by the pursuit
of changing my body beyond its
normal form.
Creating my exercise plan started
with opening the expanding pull-
outs from the middle of women's
magazines. Each pull-out displayed
a sequence of exercises done by
wispy white women. They had no
sweat, no creases, no fat and were
holding only two-pound weights.
A TV remote could have replaced
the weights they happily clutched.
Nowhere had I seen images
of women lifting weights that

demanded real strength.
ThoughI consumed these images
wholeheartedly, they sent me dan-
gerous messages. They informed me
that lifting weights should be done,
ironically, to not gain visible mus-
cles. They told me that I should not
be "bulky" or "big" or "muscular."
They led me to believe that I should
want the opposite. I should not want
to inhabit three-dimensional space.
I should want to be thin and lean
enough, soI appeared defenseless.
Besides the visible messages that
the fitness media was imparting, I
found underlying lessons between
the aspiration of thigh gaps. They
told me that by consuming less.
space, Iwould receive more love and
worth. The areas my body left blank
could be filled with more points on
an attractiveness scale designed by
men. As I peered into the images
of perfectly toned women in
fitness magazines, I saw their eyes
hinting to me that a woman's body
should never reveal real power nor
intimidate men. It was hard to look
away. Their stare was gripping, and
soon I came to see what they saw.
Each day, I followed the sequenc-
es that were supposed to burn more
calories than cardio. I religiously
did very little weight at high rep-
etition in order to build leanness
instead of big muscles. The fear of
becoming unattractive sustained
my resistance of looking strong.
Soon weightlifting became some-
thing Idid for others - to allowoth-
ers to find me attractive and worthy.
After months of revisiting the
same routines and the same corners
of the gym, I still was very removed
from the body I was promised. And
I was exhausted. I was exhaustedby

the need to constantly adhere to one
ideal and to exercise feebly. I decid-
ed to listen to my exhaustion and to
abandon what I was supposed to do.
As I wished to switch to new rou-
tines, I found very little knowledge
on how a woman can become strong
instead of beautiful.
My journey to find new ways
of lifting weights led me to see
the obvious.
It's no wonder that so many
women of all ages wish to adhere to
a singular beauty ideal. And it's no
wonder most women believe they
will become massive bodybuilders if
theybeginto liftweights.And itno
wonder that the image of a woman
bodybuilder is unattractive,because
of its "threatening" demeanor to
men. And it's no wonder that there
is little knowledge circulating
women's minds on how to safely
and properly lift weights. And it's
no wonder that the free weight
section of every gym lacks women
while men are overpopulating
it. And it's no wonder I was
afraid to ignore norms by
becomingstrong.
And it's no wonder when a
woman's worth is labeled, by her
need for the strength of men.
After learning the hidden
obviousness, I let my strength truly
reveal itself. I let my body move
toward the gravitational pull it
desired. I longed to be strong for
myself and honored my body as it
morphed into unforeseen molds.
Through my journey, Ihave come to
appreciate my ability to grow to its
own tune.

of all, I want to recognize my place of privilege
in this area. I am a white presenting, middle
class, cisgender male who largely does not face
the mounting burden of micro-aggressions.
As always, it is important to keep that in mind
as I only face micro-aggressions for my queer
identity, which does play a role in how I view
this topic. However, I'd like to move forward
as a student of social science, which will
inform my thoughts.
The more social justice circles that I've nav-
igated through, the more I have come across
a fixation on making sure language is inclu-
sive. People actively make an effort to correct
each other in order to make sure their diction
is properly inclusive. And while this prac-
tice is valuable, and certainly necessary, I am
beginning to worry. Yes, language has a pow-
erful effect in perpetuating unfair and unjust
systems, dynamics and institutions. Yes, lan-
guage can be powerfully racist, sexist, bigoted
and unintentionally hateful. Yes, language is
a subtle and subversive form of problematic
conditioning. Andyes, understanding and cor-
recting problematic language is one step in
creating an equitably functional society. How-
ever, this newlygrowingmodern view of strict
inclusive language is proving more and more
dangerous. Simply put, this massive amount
of energy focused on only inclusive language
in social justice spaces convinces people social
justice issues can be fixed simply by applying
strict scrutiny to our words. Monitoring lan-
guage to be more inclusive, while comforting,
actually does very little to help fix the larger
oppressive macro-systems and institutions
that plague America and fuel injustice. Rath-
er, inclusive language can be used to create a
space where interpersonal dialogue may lead
to generating potential solutions to larger

social problems. Inclusive language is simply
one method to facilitate the creation of spaces
where diversity is at the center of the dialogue.
However, in and of itself, inclusive language
does very little to solve the larger problems
that fuel injustice in society on a mass scale.
Before I go on, I would like to be clear that
making people comfortable in social settings
is very important. However, let's not conflate
this with fixing systemic injustice. This
modern fixation on strict scrutiny of language,
while well-intentioned, takes the focus away
from realities of fixing our larger society and
the complex tasks associated with it. Fixing
social justice issues will require complex
advocacy, coalition-building, research and
a real understanding of social dynamics,
psychology and politics. It is unfortunate
that policing language is where social justice
starts and ends from many people, because
it does nothing to help the real, pressing
needs. The modern practice of language
policing to be "inclusive" fails to recognize
the social politics of interpersonal education,
motivating political support and coalition-
building. Simply put, it turns many people
away from social justice issues in a way that
does nothing to build support or solve them.
Again, let me be clear in saying that
people should be held accountable to their
words. Language has a real effect on social
interactions, and everyone should strive to
understand how their language can make
people feel, butwe should be waryon its actual
efficacy in solving the problems that have
huge effects on people's lives such as cyclical
poverty and the achievement gap.
Ultimately, policinglanguage is asubtle form
of slacktivism and does very little in creating
actual change in the way marginalized groups
are institutionally oppressed.

On July 11, the World Health
Organization announced its
recommendation for all men who
have sex with men (MSM) to begin
taking antiretroviral drugs as a
precaution to combat the spread of
HIV/AIDS worldwide. This came
as a shock to many Americans who
in recent years haven't read or
heard many news stories about the
HIV/AIDS epidemic.
Since the initial HIV/AIDS
epidemic started in the 1980s, rates
of HIV transmission in the United
States have generally remained
stable. According to the Centers for
Disease Control, it's estimated that
1.1 million Americans are living
with HIV, and that one out of six
don't know that they have HIV.
The group in the United States
that remains most affected by HIV/
AIDS is MSM. HIV infection in
the United States has declined in
every group except gay/bisexual
men. Rates of HIV infection have
actually been increasing among
this group. From 2008 to 2010,
the rate of new HIV infections for
MSM climbed 12 percent. In 2010,
MSM made up approximately 4
percent of the U.S. population, but
accounted for 63 percent of all new
HIV infections.
In 2010, women accounted for 20
percent of all new HIV infections,
and 84 percent of these were
attributed to heterosexual contact.
In that same year, "white MSM
continued to account for the largest
number of new HIV infections,"
according to the CDC.
There are twostigmas atplayhere:
the assumption in the heterosexual
population that HIV/AIDS is a gay

disease, and the assumption in the
white MSM population that HIV/
AIDS is a disease associated with
minority MSM. The mainstream
media today portrays HIV/AIDS
in the gay community or in IV
drug users. People assume that as
long as they aren't having sex with
people from these communities
that their risk for HIV isn't very
high. These stigmas, along with the
lack of a legitimate sex education,
then lead to unsafe sex and not
being regularly tested for sexually
transmitted infections. In order to
stop this unsafe trend, the myths
surrounding HIV/AIDS must
be dispelled.
One-fourth of new HIV
infections occur in youth ages 13
to 24; most of those infected are
unknowing, not getting tested/
treated and potentially infecting
more people. HIV after contraction
may or may not produce symptoms.
Within two to four weeks after the
initial exposure, people may feel
flu-like symptoms, but eventually
these symptoms subside.
Many people will live years
before being diagnosed with HIV
or AIDS. In a campus survey our
Program on Intergroup Relations
class group conducted, only 20
percent of respondents have been
tested for STIs in the last three
months, and of that 20 percent only
11 percent were also tested for HIV.
Common responses for not being
tested were that no symptoms are
present, or that respondents did
not think that they were at risk.
Another common response was the
stigma that goes along with being
tested for HIV. Respondents didn't

want their doctors to think they
were gay or having risky sex. This
is especially true for bisexual men
who, because of society, choose not
to get tested and not to tell partners
about their encounters with men.
The misconceptions aroundcampus
about HIV/AIDS are apparent.
HIV/AIDS affects people indis-
criminately, and although the only
sure way to avoid contracting HIV
is through abstinence, there are
many ways to greatly reduce your
risk. These include using latex or
polyurethane condoms/barriers,
using water-based lubricant, ask-
ing your partner about their sexual
history, avoiding alcohol or drugs as
they alter the decision-making and
choosing lower-risk sexual activi-
ties. Frequent STI screenings (that
include HIV) are also essential.
Although HIV/AIDS is most promi-
nent today in the MSM and African
American community, all sexually
active people are at risk. Especially
when involved with casual sex part-
ners who may not have been tested
themselves, or may have lied about
their sexual histories. Sleeping with
someone is like sleeping with every-
one that they've ever slept with too.
Transmission of HIV is fully
preventable; most of the new cases
contracted are due to a lack of
knowledge and lack of precaution.
There are many great resources in
Ann Arbor for both STI testing and
safe sex. For more information about
STI testing and HIV/AIDS statistics,
please visit the CDC website or the
UHS website.

After eight years_

Experts predict
worsening gridlock
in Washington
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily News Editor
After eight years in the
minority, the Republican Party
has regained control of the U.S.
Senate.
Seven Republican candi-
dates have captured Democrat-
ic seats in Arkansas, Colorado,
Iowa, Montana, North Carolina,
South Dakota and West Vir-
ginia. The Republican majority
could widen, pending a Decem-
ber runoff in the Louisiana sen-
ate race.

For the first time since 1994,
Republicans will control both
houses of Congress with a Dem-
ocratic president in the White
House.
Both of Michigan's Senate
seats remain in Democratic
hands. In a race that was once
seen as a potential pick-up for
the Republicans, U.S. Rep. Gary
Peters (D-14th District)secured
a widening lead over Republican
challenger Terri Lynn Land,
former Michigan Secretary of
State.
With the turnover of the
Senate, Michigan's U.S. Senator
Debbie Stabenow (D) will lose
her chairmanship of the U.S.
Senate Committee on Agricul-
ture, Nutrition and Forestry.

Taylor considers himself to
have a balanced and practi-

and seeking to amend current
zoning to better represent the

student, his perspective on
town-gown relations centers on
communication. Taylor said he
expects to meet with Univer-
sity President Mark Schlissel
next week to discuss issues sur-
rounding the University's rela-
tionship with the city.
Furthermore, Taylor rec-
ognized infrastructure to be
one of the key issues following
last winter's harsh conditions.
He said this is in many ways

already being addressed by the
county as a whole, which voted
last month for a one-year mill-
age that would be levied on
Washtenaw County residents
for the explicit purpose of fix-
ing roads. While Taylor said his
experience has prepared him to
become mayor, there will still
be new challenges.
"I'm well-versed in present
issues having been a coun-
cilmember, but there are natu-
rally a lot of things a mayor does
that I have never done that will

Taylor said a private swear-
ing in will occur next Monday
and the public event will come
at his first council meeting as
mayor Nov. 17th.
New councilmembers Grand,
Kraphol, and Westphal all ran
unopposed in the general elec-
tion, but Grand said they used
this time between the primary
and the time when they will
take their seat on council to get
an early start learning the ropes
of city council.
"There are three of us who
are all running unopposed, so
we have started orientation
early. There is going to be a
learning curve," Grand said.
"We've had a couple meet-
ings with the city attorney, but
things like legal details can't be
learned in just a brief orienta-
tion."
Westphal said in the next
few weeks, communication will
be key as he begins his time on
city council.
"There are some clear signs
that Ann Arbor is going through
some evolution," Westphal said.
"I encourage collaboration and
coming together to see what
Ann Arbor will look like in the
future, so to the extent that we
can keep everythingthatis spe-
cial about Ann Arbor and yet
welcome more people here and
more opportunity, the better."

poorly attended
across campus
By ALLANA AKHTAR
Daily Staff Reporter
Results are in across the
country for the midterm elec-
tion - historically known for
lower voter turnouts than presi-
dential years. However, Univer-
sity students braved the rain to
casttheir ballots atpollingloca-
tions throughout campus.
According to a poll by the
Harvard Institute of Politics;
only 26 percent of young voters
said theywould "definitely vote"
prior to the election, similar to
the 27-percent proportion in the
2010 midterm elections.
Of college students, 31 per-
cent said they would definitely
vote.
Larry Kestenbaum, Washt-
enaw County Clerk and Reg-
ister of Deeds, said relatively
low voter turnout among young
people could be attributed to
campaigns and advertising that
wasn't targeted toward them.
A change in the Michigan
voter laws 10 years ago mandat-
ed that first-time voters must
either vote in person or pick up

an absentee ballot in person.
Kestenbaum said this law was a
hindrancetostudentswholived
away from their home districts,
and politicians believed that it
was futile to attempt to market
toyoungvoters.
At Pierpont Commons, Ann
Arbor resident Lisa Jibson, a
poll volunteer, said many stu-
dents tried tovote Tuesdaywho
could not. They were registered
in a district outside of Ann
Arbor or had moved from their
original registration address
withinthe city.
"We've had to redirect quite
a few," Jibson said. "We hate to
have anyone feel like they didn't
get the chance to vote."
LSA freshman Cole Zingas
voted for the first time Tuesday
morning. Zingas said he wanted
to vote regardless of party lines,
and voted for mostly Democrats
save Republican Gov. Rick Sny-
der.
"I just didn't believe Mark
Schauer had any kind of real
plan for the state," he said. "I
liked what Rick Snyder did the
lastfewyears in Michigan."

unemployment rate rate is its
lowest since 2008, though it is
still above the national rate of
5.9 percent.
Last year, Snyder pushed
through Medicaid expansion
under the Affordable Care
Act against the wishes of the
Republican-led legislature.
More than 400,000 people
have enrolled in the Healthy
Michigan Plan since its April
launch. Despite Republi-
can opposition, Snyder also
secured an agreement with
Canadian officials to go for-
ward with the New Interna-
tional Trade Crossing, a new
bridge connecting Detroit and
Windsor.

The Medicaid and bridge
decisions were indicative of
Snyder's willingness to break
with his party, and followed
the principles laid out in his
first campaign. A former chief
executive of computer com-
pany Gateway and a venture
capitalist, Snyder entered
the 2010 gubernatorial race
as a relative unknown and a
political novice. His pledge to
put politics aside and instead
use his business acumen to
improve the state appealed
to voters, as he sailed to an
18-point victory over Demo-
crat Virg Bernero.
"It's time to drop the labels
of party, of ideology, of geog-
raphy," Snyder said in his 2010
victory speech. "To make this
work there is only one label
that matters. That label is

really got her message across."
In remarks to the media
Tuesday night, Peters charac-
terized his win as the result of
months of traveling the state
and building out grassroots
efforts.

"I take the job of being a
representative very seriously,
which means being in the com-
munity, being accessible, lis-
tening to folks, and I think that
paid off today," he said. "I think
they were looking for someone
who is out there working to
earn the right to represent the
people of Michigan in Wash-
ington D.C."

Peters found success running
on a platform focused on his
record on the economy, climate
change and women's issues.
Early in the general election
campaign season, he hosted a
"Great Lakes Job Tour," high-
lighting the role that the state's
businesses played in support-
ing the Great Lakes and vice
versa. Throughout his tenure in

Congress, he was also involved
in legislation to support small
businesses, namely his co-spon-
sorship of the Small Business
Jobs Act, which gave states
funding to create lending pro-
grams for small businesses and
manufacturers, and he called
repeatedly duringthe campaign
for an increase to the minimum
wage. His campaign also'sought

to create a distinction between
him and Land on pay equity
and pro-choice policies, both of
which Peters has supported.
"What folks want, I found
was all common, regardless of
where you are in Michigan," he
told the crowd during his vic-
tory speech Tuesday evening.
"People want to have a fair
wage for a fair day's work. They

want to have quality health care
for their families, they want
to be able to send their kids to
good schools and live in safe
neighborhoods. And when it is
all said and done, people want
be able to retire with dignity.
And as Democrats, that is what
we have stood for since day one
and we will continue to stand
for days in the future."

Republicans lead
in early results,
but Democrats
remain hopeful
By CLAIRE BRYAN and
ALLANA AKHTAR
Daily StaffReporters
As of 2 a.m. Wednesday, the
race for two contested spots
on the University's Board of
Regents was too close to call.
Republicans Rob Steele and
Ronald Weiser lead with596,732
and 594,196 votes, respective-
ly, compared to Democrats
Mike Behm's 440,903 votes
and incumbent Kathy White's
477,101votes.
Early Wednesday morning,
the Michigan Secretary of State
had yet to release final tallies
from several counties, including
the heavily Democratic Genesee
and Wayne Counties that con-
tain Flint and Detroit.
In 2012, the final election
results were not determined
until the following day. In that
year, the two Republican can-
didates led for most of the early
morning hours, but fell to Dem-
ocrats once votes from Wayne
County were tallied.
The board's two open seats
are currently held by Regent
Julia Darlow (D), who is not
seeking reelection, and White.
White, who currently serves
as chair of the Board of Rgents,
is a professor of law at Wayne
State University Law School in
Detroit, an instructor of law at
the United States MilitaryAcad-
emy at West Point in New York
and a Lieutenant Colonel in the
United States Army Reserve.
Weiser founded McKinley
Associates, a commercial real
estate company, and served on
multiple boards for nonprof-
it organizations including the
United Negro College Fund of
Washtenaw County, the Henry
Ford Museum in Dearborn and
the Detroit Institute of Arts.
He also served as the Amer-
ican ambassador to the Slo-
vak Republic under the Bush
Administration.
Steele, a University Inteflex
program alum, is a cardiologist
at St. Joseph Mercy Health Sys-
tem in Ypsilanti and served as
a clinical assistant professor at
the University for more than 20
years.
Behm works as a litigator in
Flint and served as president of
the Michigan Association for
Justice in 2011, a trade asso-
ciation. He worked on former
Secretary of State Hillary Clin-
ton's presidential campaign and
served as a delegate to the Dem-
ocratic National Convention in
2008.
The eight-member board is

elected for eight-year terms on
the statewide ballot. The board
is currently composed of six
Democrats and two Republi-
cans.
In 2012, Democrats Mark
Bernstein and Shauna Ryder
Diggs won the two open seats
on the board, carried to victory
in part by the presidential race
at the top of the ticket. Similar-
ly, Republicans Andrea Fischer
Newman and Andrew Richner
won the election in 2010, a year
that saw low Democratic turn-
out and the election of Republi-
can Gov. Rick Snyder.
In this election cycle, all four
major-party candidates empha-
sized affordability in their plat-

forms, but differed on their
plans for its execution.
Steele had said he planned to
finance studentloansbytapping
into the University's endow-
ment, while White said she
intended to strengthen financial
aid. Behm and Weiser see the
University's satellite campuses
in Dearborn and Flint as addi-
tional, more affordable options
for students and said they plan
to strengthen these campuses.
Earlier this month, the candi-
dates met for a candidate forum
at the Gerald R. Ford School of
Public Policy to discuss avariety
of University issues, including
campusclimate,theinstitution's
response to sexual assault and
working with the city of Detroit.
Mostofthe candidatesshared
similar views on these issues,
such as going to greater lengths
to aid survivors of sexual assault
and working to increase diver-
sity among students within
the boundaries of Proposal 2,
the 2006 ballot initiative that
banned consideration of race in
college admissions. Behm also
expressed support for the Uni-
versity's financial divestment
from fossil fuel companies.
In the last year, the regents
have been involved in several
significant decisions, including
the appointment of University
President Mark Schlissel.
Political Science Prof. Vin-
cent Hutchings said regent
candidates typically don't gain
as much publicity compared to
other races.
"These lower-level offices put
a bigger burden on the voter,"
Hutchings said. "It is harder
for people to gain information
about these people because
information in the media is less
plentiful."
Cynthia Wilbanks, the Uni-
versity's vice president for
government relations, ran
unsuccessfully for regent in
1986.
"Itwas agreatexperiencebut
I think what you learn quickly is
that the visibility of the regent
races is really pretty low in the
electorate," she said.
For that reason, Wilbanks
said the results in regents races
are sometimes driven by the top
of the ticket, particularly when
voters cast straight-ticket bal-
lots.
"Straight party ticket voting
may happen a little more fre-
quently when you are down at
the bottom of the ballot," Wil-
banks said. "That historical pat-
tern has held true."
In atelephone interview with
The Michigan Daily, Regent
Emeritus Frederick C. Matthaei
said he does not think parti-
sanship plays a large role in the
functioning of the board.
Matthaei was appointed
to the Board in 1967 after the

resignation of his father, the
namesake of the Universi-
ty's botanical gardens. He ran
for reelection a year later as a
Republican nominee, but lost
when Democratic presidential
candidate Hubert Humphrey
carried the state.
"I think their political party
is important only because they
have to run through it," he said.
"You don't want eight regents to
be all on the same party. I think
it's good to have avariety of edu-
cated people, number one, and
number two, it's a question of
how good their personal expe-
riences could be for serving as a
regent, not what political party
they're in."

Democrats," Political Science
Prof. Mike Traugott said in an
interview with The Michigan
Daily.
In the legislature's lame
duck session in December
2012, Snyder signed right-to-
work legislation into law, out-
lawing union requirements
for members to pay dues as
a condition of employment.
The following December,
Snyder signed a measure ban-
ning abortion coverage from
private health plans, instead
requiring women who wanted
such a plan to purchase sup-
plemental insurance. He has
also declined to take a per-
sonal stance on gay marriage,
choosing instead to defer to
the pending decision in feder-

al appeals court on the state's
ban on same-sex marriage.
The Schauer campaign
attempted to differentiate
from Snyder on those issues,
and argued that the Gover-
nor's decisions to lower the
business tax and raise taxes on
retirees hurt the middle class.
Schauer also sharply criticized
Snyder for cutting both K-12
and higher education funding
in his first budget - though
both funds have increased in
each of the budgets since.
In a concession speech
Tuesday night, Schauer reiter-
ated his commitment to those
issues.
"We fought hard," he told
the crowd. "We left it all on the
field. We made this race about
our kids, about seniors, about
our middle class, about work-

ing people."
He said he was disappoint-
ed, but not discouraged, by the
results.
"This was not just about
2014," he said. "This was a
movement about the future of
our state. If I learned one thing
during this campaign, it's that
the people of Michigan never
give up. When we get knocked
down, we get right back up.
For me, this campaign is over.
But for all of us as Democrats,
as Michiganders who love our
great state, this work must and
will continue."
College Republicans Presi-
dent Gabe Leaf, an LSA senior,
said he has been happy with
Snyder's work in higher educa-
tion, despite public criticism.
"He's really putting a focus
on education," Leaf said. "He's

a Michigan man himself so he
comes from us, he knows what
we've been through, the kind
of struggles are for higher edu-
cation to operate and he's also
a businessman, so he knows
how to run these things more
effectively."
In closing his victory speech
Tuesday night, Snyder made a
commitment to carry over the
energy of reinvention into his
second term.
"The passion, the fire, the
excitement, the conviction to
do the reinvention that you've
seen this Tuesday, I'm goingto
have it on Wednesday, Thurs-
day, Friday and for the next
four years," Snyder said.

'Half' the intrigue

Julie Iovine discusses
changing landscape

CBS sitcom
disappoints in final
season premiere
ByKARENHUA
DailyArts Writer
This past Thursday, the
iconic sitcom "Two and a Half
Men" premiered its twelfth and
final season.
The show
historically
has been one Two and a
of the most
beloved and Half Men
highly-rated on Seasonl2
television, but Premiere
in recent years
hasseenseveral Thursdays
ups and downs. at9 p.m.
At this point, CBS
it seems like
CBS continues
to renew the show simply for
the sake of tradition. While it
is true "Men" has become a
sort of American legend, the
show's audience is waning and
demonstrates little potential for
growth.
Now with the absence of
Charlie (Charlie Sheen, "Anger
Management"), many viewers
have turned away, even with the
younger, cleaner Walden (Ashton
Kutcher, "No Strings Attached")
as asubstitute. With Alan's (John
Cryer, "Pretty in Pink") brother
gone, and his son Jake (Angus
T. Jones, "The Rookie") "in the
army," the show can only come
up with so many fresh premises
for two grown male best friends
thathavenotbeenused in sitcoms
before.
Thetitlenolongermakessense,
as Jake is now not only a legal
adult, but he is also absent in the
premiere. Even though this will
be its final season, "Men" must
only come up with a multitude of
excuses for the disappearance of
characters as the show runs on
diminishing possibilities.
Whether or not the producers
like it, theycannot stop the
audience -rora automatically
comparing Kutcher to Sheen.
Perhaps firing the volatile Sheen
helpedtheir industry's image, but
many argue thatthe series should
have wrapped up with Sheen's

"Guess we'll just ride this one out..."
dismissal. The original character
dynamic is simply unparalleled.
Regardless of Kutcher's talent,
Sheen still stands as the face of
the show, as he has a #winning
stage presence thatsimplycannot
be matched.
The premiere starts with
the two men and missing half-
man, donned in their Halloween
best. Walden unexpectedly
suffers a heart attack, and after
his "terrifying" near-death
experience, he completely over-
dramatizes his dismay to where
his "desperation" seems more like
sarcasm.
The premiere continues this
pattern ofamalgamatinghilarious
moments with artificial ones
to the point where the writing
simply feels uncomfortable.
There -are far too many instances
when Walden's lines are so over-
dramatically presented that it is
ambiguous whether he truly is
tryingtosarcastic orgenuine.
Especially when Walden pokes
fun at Alan, the jokes seemed
rehearsed and timed, without
the spontaneity that is supposed
to qualify his character as witty.
The humor becomes too cheesy,
especially when it is ambiguous -
atleastinitially-whetherWalden
legitimately has a heart attack or
whether he fakes it for attention.
During Walden's contemplation
of his "purpose of existence," he
decides he wants to introduce a
child in his life, which ironically
contradicts his free-spirited
persona. He's not supposed to be
the one philosophizing to Alan,
but rather vige, versa - another
strange discontinuity in the
premiere.
Walden is rejected from the
adoption agencies, however,
because his status as a single father
is unfavorable in comparison to

stable married couples. Walden,
disappointed, understands how
marriageissimplynotanoptionfor
him, as he notes, "you have to find
the right person - or Mila Kunis."
This is no accident as Kutcher
and Kunis are very publicly
engaged with a newborn. While
the connection is appropriate,
it does not help the audience's
difficulty in separating Walden
as an on-screen character from
Kutcher's persona as an actor.
As a resolution, Walden
ultimately proposes to Alan to
increase their odds of adopting a
child. Although the ridiculousness
of the situation is meant to elicit
laughs, it rather produces nervous
chuckles of confusion. Is this
the show's way of making weak
social commentary on same-sex
marriage and adoption?
Meanwhile, the only primary
characters are Alan, Walden
and the occasional insertion of
Berta who is really only there for
comedic timing or as a straight
man, something the show
certainly does not need if there's
better chemistrybetweenWalden
and Alan. Berta's character
truly bears an irrelevance and
indifference. In addition, there
are no other subplots to avert
audience attention during the
half an hour, so as interest
atrophies slowly for all secondary
characters, it will soon diminish
for the two primary men, aswell.
When Sheen was still present,
the series was known for its low-
brow, dry farce. It perfected the
use of comedic relief, as it was
well-known for intercutting
moments of sentimental sincerity
to vulgar jokes about boobs
or farts. Unfortunately, a few
seasons after his departure,
"Men" hasn't started off its final
seasonwith greatpromises.

WSJ architecture
columnist talks
journalism industry
ByKATHLEENDAVIS
DailyArts Writer
For the last decade or so,
print journalism has seen
a sharp decline thanks to
technological advancements
that make information so
readily accessible. Paired
with a rough ride through
the latest recession, arts
journalism has found itself
taking the blunt of section
cuts and layoffs, frequently
falling second to sections
deemed more important
and profitable like news
and sports. However, some
arts-exclusive journalists
have managed to navigate
the changing landscape of
journalism successfully.
Julie Iovine, architecture
columnist for the Wall Street
Journal and the former
Executive Editor for The
Architect's Newspaper, is
a striking example of this
versatility, and came to the
University's TaubmanCollege
of Architecture and Urban
Planning last Wednesday to
discuss the changing worlds
of both architecture and arts
journalism.
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily, Iovine spoke
about her views on students
breaking into journalism and
the future of architecture.
Iovine is a native of
Washington DC and studied
Ancient Greek at Yale before
deciding to become a writer.
She developed a love for
architecture after living
in Athens for a year and
later moved to New York
City to write for various
publications, including the
New York Times, where she
was on staff for 13 years
writing about architecture
and design. In 2008, she
became Executive Editor of
The Architect's Newspaper,

a publication which delivers
news and inside reports
to the niche architecture
community.
"What drew me to
architecture reporting is
that it's so embedded into
the real world and you can't
escape it - that's why I live
in New York," Iovine said. "I
don't want to live in a suburb
where I don't see horrible
things, I want to see them,
and architecture is like that.
It has to face the real stuff,
and any architecture that
doesn't is really missing the
point."
Unpaid interns, rented
desks, large paycuts and
intensive layoffs were the
sacrifices the newspaper
had to make in order to stay
afloat during the recession,
and in 2012, Iovine finally
left the publication as she
was financially unable to stay
longer.
"In a fantastic way,
architecture is really used
to this 'boom-bust' thing,"
Iovine said. "(The recession)
was a fascinating time to
learn how to stay resilient
and dynamically inventive as
architect's are. They figure
out what they need to do to
get through, and that's what
we did. As we look back, it
was actually quite a neat
time."
Before leaving The
Architect's Newspaper,
Iovine helped oversee a large
digital expansion, including
launching a sleek website
as well as Facebook and
Twitter platforms. Iovine
nods at critics who question
how such a physical art form
can translate over a digital
platform, yet she believes
the advancements have been
positive for architecture.
"It's a good thing and a bad
thing. It draws even further
architecture's tendency to
be a beauty contest, because
you can just splash these
spectacular photographs
onto the internet and that's
what some people think
it's all about," Iovine said.
"However, it also fits itself
very smoothly into the world
of internet visualization.
As architecture has
evolved to accommodate
and embrace aneco-friendly
landscape, Iovine highlighted
the factors that she takes
into consideration during a
critique of a newbuilding, the
foundation for what she does
at the Wall Street Journal.
In her lecture, she brought
up examples of exceptional
works of architecture, which
she believes has changed the
future of the art.
"I need to be able to figure
out what's going on, and
without the architect telling
me. It's important to me that
the building tells me what's
important, and that the space
is comprehensible to me just
as a user, not as someone who
has just had the architect
describe it all," Iovine said.
"Knowing the constraints
that were on the project is

also important, whether it
was budget, or political or
zoning issues. People see
these things and may judge
it as horrible, but they don't
know why it's horrible. It may
be that the community had a

stake in it."
Iovine gave advice to
Taubman students looking
to break into the competitive
world of architecture, from
the point of view of someone
whose critiques can truly
change public opinion
regarding an artist and their
buildings.
"You have to be absolutely
devoted," Iovine said. "You
must be ready to join the cult
before you take that leap,
and if you do it can be very
rewarding."
In terms of the ever-
changing world of niche
arts journalism, Iovine
urged national publications
to retain their arts writers
and to keep informing and
shaping public opinion.
"(Arts journalism) will
thrive, but I worry that it
will only thrive among an
inside track and close in on
itself," Iovine said. "The gap
will grow between how the
wider public understands
art and art journalists, and
newspapers are dropping
their architecture columnists
left and right - There's only
six architecture columnists
left in national newspapers.
This shouldn't be that
way. More newspapers and
magazines should think
it's important that there
be someone on hand and
describe the world and how
it's being shaped."
Taubman graduate student
Brooke Dexter and Taubman
senior Alyssa Kargl run
Dimensions, the student
architecture publication at
U-M. Dimensions releases one
issue yearly and features the
work of dedicated Taubman
students, as well as the
work of outside professional
sources like Iovine.
"One of the things that's
really important to us is
showcasing student work,
but also including voices
from outside sources that
influence the way students
think," Dexter said. "For
example, hearing (Iovine)
say that architects need to
simplify their words when
talking to non-architects
is very interesting for us,
and helps the student work
stay relevant in the outside
world."
"Since (Taubman students)
come from the same
architecture education,
sometimes while working we
become somewhat similar
minded," Kargl said. "We
sometimes get caught in a
certain way of thinking or a
certain way of learning, so
lectures like these are always
refreshing, and offer a new
perspective.
"It's easy to get too focused
on some small detail of your
project that you are so stuck
on," Dexter said. "When you
come to lectures like these,
you realize that architecture
is so much bigger than what
you're working on now, and
that's very refreshing."
"A degree of architecture
at Taubman is more like a

degree in design," Kargl said.
"You learn speaking skills,
graphic design and just a lot
of things are embedded into
the degree. You can end up
doing a lot more with the
skills we gain here."

Michigan's best-kept secret

Chatman stepping
into starter's role

By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Editor
Early in the second quarter
against Indiana, quarterback
Devin Gardner found himself
under duress inthe pocket.While
going through his progressions
behind center, the fifth-year
senior locked in on receiver
Amara Darboh running a route
near the right sideline.
Just as Gardner let go of the
ball, the Hoosiers' linebacker
in coverage jumped the route
and appeared to have the ball in
his hands with an easy path to
the end zone. Instead, Darboh
knocked the ball loose and
prevented the pick six.
"I was kind of thinking ...
hit the arm cause I hear the
(defensive backs) coach say that
all the time. So I just kind of tried
to swipe and hit the arm and I'm
thankful he didn't get the pick,"
Darboh said after the game.
Darboh has been arguably the
best-kept secret of Michigan's
offense this season. The receiver
put that talent on display against
Indiana, leading the offense with
nine receptions for 107 yards and
a 12-yard touchdown. It was the
first time the redshirt sophomore
passed the century mark in his
career.
All season, Darboh has been
Gardner's favorite target behind
junior Devin Funchess. But
with Funchess usually receiving
double, sometimes triple,.
coverage, Gardner has slowly
grown a rapport with Darboh,
who has 26 catches for 362 yards
and two touchdowns on the
season. Two-hundred-fourteen
yards of that production have
come in the last three games.
"I think, for me, it's the more
I play the more I get used to the
game," Darboh said Saturday.
"And feel it out and feel what the
defensive backs are doing and feel
out where to be, and I think the
more I play, the more experience

By JAKE LOURIM
Daily Sports Editor
Yes, Michigan freshman
Kameron Chatman plays a very
similar style to former Wolverine
Glenn Robinson III. Yes, he plays
the same position as Robinson
did. And yes, Robinson left that
spot open when he declared for
the NBA Draft last spring.
But no, Chatman is not looking
to replace Robinson.
"I wouldn't really compare
myself to him," he said Thursday
at the team's media day. "He was
a great player, but I don't really
go out there and try to compare
myself to him."
Whether he likes it or not,
Chatman will be counted on at
least sometimes this season to fill
the void Robinson left.
Chatman feels good about.

to play meaningful minutes
in his first season. Michigan
coach John Beilein's success at
turning freshman role players
into sophomore stars has been
well-documented, but Chatman
thinks he's ready to step in right
away.
Beilein is still undecided on
a possible starting lineup, but
Chatman has the potential to fill
that void. Chatman is 6-foot-7,
210 pounds, Robinson 6-foot-6,
220. Chatman was the No. 38
overall recruit in the 2014 class
and was listed as a small forward,
but projects to be a stretch-four,
much like Robinson.
"He's going to play both
forward positions as well, and if
we ever got stuck, he could play
in the backcourt," Beilein said
Oct. 2 before the team opened
practice. "All of the freshmen are
OK. What happens when we put
two or three weeks together?"
The Wolverines have now

put four weeks together, and
Thursday at open practice,
Chatman looked the part of a
starter. He showed his length
and athleticism on both sides,
much like Robinson did. He was
knockedaroundabitduringmock
contact drills, but he is already
listed at 10 pounds heavier than
he is in his recruiting profile.
And despite the possible
difference in physicality, he is
an inch taller with a wingspan
similar to Robinson's.
"We saw early that he could be
a rotation guy," Beilein said. "We
have a rating system that we use
that I won't share with you, but
there's a number we give a guy
who we feel is in the rotation of
top eight as a freshman, and he
graded outat that."
The coach said being in the
top five and being ready to start
is very different, another step
up from his current spot in the
top-eight rotation. But with
sophomore Derrick Walton
Jr., ' junior Caris LeVert and
sophomore Zak Irvin appearing
as clear starters, Chatman looks
to be one of the viable candidates
for the fourth spot, beside a host
of big men at the'5.'
That doesn't mean he can't
slide to the '2' or '3' to fill in.
"We have guards, we have
forwards and we have a guy that
plays in the middle," Beilein said
Oct. 2. "Sometimes, we'll have
four of them out there at one time
that are guards. Because of Kam's
ball handling ability, I think he
canplay alotof positions"
For now, Chatman's skill puts
him in a good spot for playing
time starting with Monday's
exhibition against Wayne
State. He'll likely be playing in
Robinson's old spot, and he'll be
compared to him, whether he
likes it or not.

it was a seamless fit.

THE VISUAL STATEMENT:HALLOWEEN IN NEW YORK
BY VIRGINIA LOZANO

Ihad the pleasure of attending one of American photographer Mary Ellen
Mark's photography workshops last week in New York City. Like much of Mary
Ellen's work, we focused on street photography of children and dogs. It was an envi-
ronment where we had to find moments in Halloween events that were more than
just the costumes or adorable subjects. Moments that told stories of where we were,
and how the neighborhoods within Queens and Brooklyn are composed of both rich
and poor areas living rightnext to each other. To put itasimply, it was what Mary
Ellen, who has won three Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Awards, described asjust
"American."

* *the facts that stood
clear in my mind con-
sistently. There are
seven major passages in
the Bible condemning
homosexuality in some
form - none of them
are Jesus speaking, and
more importantly, none
of them speak to how
we understand homo-
sexuality or bisexuality

in 2014. Modern psychology hasn't
recognized homosexuality as men-
tal illness for decades and Method-
ism respects the science of its time.
Methodism stays consistent to its
interpretations. If we take Leviti-
cus 18:22, "thou shalt not lie with
mankind, as with womankind: it is
abomination," that would mean we
would need to take every passage,
every sin and punishment, literally. -
But where my identity evolved
was where I learned that being
Methodist did not mean stand-
ing with a list of beliefs every one
of my fellow Methodists believed.
Issues of homosexuality would not
be on that list, because Methodism,
unlike so many religions, does not
have a list. We have articles of faith
in our discipline that we respect but
we are not a confessional church.
Instead, we have a quadrilateral
scripture that embodies: scripture,
tradition, reason and experience.
Methodists, by definition, means
the person sitting next to you in
the pew takes scripture, tradition,
reason and experience in any form
they believe. We are not taught or
directed, we are enlightened and
given the opportunity to interpret.
And today, not enough have inter-
preted and understood that those
seven passages should not keep
gays, lesbians, bisexuals, transgen-
der or any other humans out of the
church. We must continue to inter-
pret so others can continue to stand
as Methodists.

e W met in the student jour-
nalism office at our subur-
ban high school. She was
on the yearbook staff, a grade older;
I was an editor for the newspaper. It
was like forbidden love. More onthat
later.
A year earlier, another newspa-
per writer and I had lost a lengthy
battle with our high school's admin-
istration over the fate of the news-
paper class. Over time, we fought
their decision to cut the class by
reincarnating the newspaper as an
after school club. At that time, I had
no idea how important this organi-
zation, the office from which it was
run and everything that came out of
it would be in my life.
We officially met on Valentine's
Day: Feb. 14, 2011. It was sophomore
year: the year I had a crush on Dar-
ren Criss, worked backstage at my
high school's production of Seussical
the Musical and took AF U.S. His-
tory. Though I recognized her face
from all of the afternoons I had spent
in that office, writing and editing
stories, we had never had a real con-
versation beforecthat day. In the years
after, I'd forget the date of everything
else that happened, but I would never
forgot that date.
Our first conversation was about
"Glee," which we both watched reli-
giously. Maybe this is an unusual
(and typically high school) way for
two people to become best friends
- but all it took was that conversa-
tion for us to connect. Suddenly, we

were texting constantly and eating
lunch together everyday in the jour-
nalism office. In no time at all, I felt
more comfortable around her than
anyone else; we shared our deepest
secrets and fears and dreams with
each other and never, ever ran out of
things to talk about. In this friend-
ship, I found a deeper level of emo-
tional intimacy than anything I had
ever shared with another person. She
was the best friend that I'd ever had.
With all the similarities that
allowed us to become such close
friends, we were also incredibly dif-
ferent. She was outgoing, where I
was reserved; she loved taking pho-
tographs, I loved to write. She was
confident and sure of herself while I
worried too much about what others
thought of me. Ultimately, the news-
paper gave me this relationship. We
bonded over the ridiculous amounts
of time we devoted to our publica-
tions. The school yearbook contin-
ued to win awards, while the school
newspaper struggled to stay alive.
Regardless, we both did a lot of our
growingup in a computer lab.
We kissed for the first time while
we were watching a documentary on
September 11. By this point, Iwas fill-
ing out college applications and had
been promoted to editor in chief of
the now-monthly newspaper. She
was a freshman in college and had
moved several hours from home. It
seemed like everything had changed
since I was a sophomore, but our
friendship endured it all.

I'll never forget that moment. To
this day, I don't know who started it.
What I do know is that I enjoyed it,
it was completely unexpected and it
hit me straight in the head with no
warning.
The following week was perhaps
the scariest time of my life. I had no
idea what was happening: my world
was turned upside down. One week I
considered myself to be straight and
her to be my best friend; the next,
everything was different. The idea
of my friendship changingscared me
shitless. She was the only one I want-
ed to talk to, yet she was the root of
my insecurities.
So began the coming out pro-
cess: something I still can't stand. I
have never been ashamed or embar-
rassed of my sexuality - whatever
it is - but I hate the act of telling. I
feel like it is oftentimes similar to the
fact that Ihave always worn glasses:
something that is importantto me, in
some ways, but mostly just a part of
who Iam. I hate coming out because
it makes me feel so vulnerable: what
is to most people an afterthought is,
to me, deeply personal. At the time, I
had no idea how to define my sexuali-
ty, unwilling to classify it as anything
other than "not straight." I hated
it, because I felt like I had to define
it, though I wasn't sure what that
definition was. I hated it, because of
my friends never had to come out as
straight. Coming out to each person
presented a unique, complicated bat-
tle with myself.

After a lot of discussion and deep
thinking, we decided to make our
relationship official, but I had no
one to share the happy news with.
Instead, we started together on a
path to self-discovery. I realized
more and more, as every minute went
by, how strongly I had felt towards
her. Though I previously had crushes
on boys, it was nothing compared to
the way I felt when she walked into a
room. Everything I had ever done, I
wanted to do with her.
Our relationship didn't survive
my senior year of high school, but
sometimes I wonder if she would
still be in my life had we been in a
boy-girl relationship. The pressures
that came from falling in love while
keeping it a secret and coming to
terms with my own sexuality were
immense. This put pressures on our
relationship that no one should have
to face. And being several hours
apartonly made it that much worse.
Looking back, all the signs were
there. We were close in a way I had
never been with any of my friends.
But I had always identified as
straight. Coming to terms with this
change in my identity was a process
I still struggle with day in and day
out. I have learned that sexuality is
a spectrum and is not as black and
white as I previouslythought.
Luckily, I had several people
who stood by me throughout the
ordeal, and for that I cannot thank
them enough. I am blessed with
open-minded friends and family who

Do U.S. colleges have something to learn from German tuition policy?
by Rachel Premack

en German universities began
charging tuition in 2006, the back-
lash was swift. At the University of
Freiburg, where University of Michigan His-
ry Department Chair Kathleen Canning
was administering a study abroad program in
the 2000s, students occupied classrooms and
hung enormous banners that read, "Education
is a human right."
The fees that caused the outrage? An aver-
age of $630 per semester. At this University,
in-state LSA students pay $6,579 and out-
of-staters pay $20,789.
"It didn't matter how much it was,"
Canning said. "It didn't matter that it was
affordable for most middle-class fami-
lies. It was the principal of introducing
.mtion."
Lucky for the students, the final Ger-
man federal state abolished tuition in
October. Now anyone - German citizen
or not - can receive a free college educa-
tion at one of Germany's globally lauded
universities.
Past German college students are now
among world-renowned philosophers,
researchers, entrepreneurs, writers and
leaders. The nation is the world's third-
largest importer and exporter. More
Nobel laureates are from Germany than
any other nationality - save for the U.S.
IMU.K.
So why don't these students have to
pay tie thousands of dollars per year that
Americans do?
Tuition in the United States has not
always been so high. At the University, adjust-
ing for inflation, in-state students paid $1,472
in the 1969-1970 academic year. It rose, by
decade, to $1,970 in 1980, $3,065 in 1990 and
$5,704 by 2000.
Just as well, until the mid-20th century,
higher education was something attainable
only by the most elite social classes in Ger-
many.
"The whole notion of buildings, education,
was a fundamental attribute of the bourgeoi-
sie and the nobility," Canning said. "It was not
something that anyone in the middle class or
lower middle class could aspire to."
University education remains somewhat
exclusive in Germany, though its hierarchical
system is becoming easier to enter. In elemen-
tary school, children take an exam that divides
them into one of three schools: gymnasium;
realschule or hauptschule. Only gymnasium is
a university-preparatory school.
Gymnasium has become more accessible
VdMMthe past few decades. According to Ger-
man dataportal Statista, 15 percentofstudents
in 1952 were in gymnasium. By 2005, it was 33
percent.
The increasingly open doors of the gym-
nasium have caused a strain on universities
the past decade and a half, Canning said. Pro-
essorships are few. In the Frieburg history
department, for instance, Canning said there

were nine history professors. The University
of Michigan has 90.
"There's a second tier of what they call
mid-career instructors who, however, have no
job security and they're not even permanent
lecturers like-you would have here," Canning
added. "They're often filling in or actually
teaching for free while hoping to geta profes-
sorship somewhere else."
Johannes von Moltke, associate profes-
sor and chair of German, said, "There's over-

per semester was unlikely to break the bank;
however, the implementation of tuition on
principle could later prove difficult.
"There's always the possibility that it could
be increased," Capotescu said. "We saw that
in the U.S. that once higher tuition was intro-
duced it kept increasing."
In 2012, the average debt of a University
graduate was nearly $28,000, with 44 per-
cent of the student body graduating with debt.
Moreover, while the German government

client and because of the way American capi-
talism works, customer service is part of the
experience... Of course it kind of commodifies
education. It becomes a good to be exchanged
between a seller and buyer. Whereas in Ger-
many, the ideal is still it's a public good so
you're not paying or buying for it, you're taking
advantage of your right to education. But then
it isn't kind of fenced in with all of these con-
sumer bells and whistles."
That lack-of-consumer model is also
reflected in the type of education students can
expect. Canning described three types of
classes: lectures and small, introductory and
advanced seminars.
A first-year student in an introductory
seminar on the French Revolution, Canning
described, would be expected to already
know the chronology of the Revolution, or
receive suggestions for background reading.
The course would focus on reading primary
sources - in French - and discussingthem.
Students in lecture courses rarely have
performance-based measurements, like
quizzes or tests, at the end. Instead, stu-
dents ask to take an oral exam with a profes-
sor if they feel they know the material well
enough.
"If you bomb, it's your own fault and no
one cares," Canning said. "There's nobody
there to hold your hand. It's up to you. You're
a scholar, you're at the university because
you wantto actually learn. Ourlittle 'holding
out the carrot' just doesn't happen."
LSA junior Alexandra Trecha, who is
y studying in Freiburg this year, noticed the
difference in expectations.
"There definitely isn't as much 'checking in'
and students are expected to be much more
responsible and invested in their work here
compared to the U.S.," Trecha said.
At the University, students expect, well,
everything from their college experience. The
University provides transportation, housing,
food, libraries, mental health support, aca-
demic and career advising and - perhaps most
importantly -- a social scene.
In the U.S., the college years are supposed
to be "the best time" of your life. Germans see
college as a continuation of one's education,
as momentous as moving from tenth to 11th
grade. More fanfare surrounds. moving away
from home.
"It's not the place you go and get away from
your parents for four years and drink and fig-
ure out who you are," Canning said.
Capotescu noted that much soul-searching
and deciding what one's talents are occurs in
high school. Indeed, hopeful doctors in Ger-
many attend medical or law school directly
after high school rather than dabbling in biol-
ogy courses for two years before deciding to
major in philosophy.
"College is a lot more functional," Capo-
tescu said. "You go through university to get
to a job."

boxers? briefs? boxer briefs?

THE THOUGHT BUBBLE

'm not sure what kind of
underwear I'm supposed to
buy anymore.
When I was a toddler, briefs
were the thing. Then boxer briefs
when Igrew up alittle. Boxers were
cool because you were supposed to
sag your pants and show them off.
I guess it was considered "cool" at
the time. I mean I still think box-
ers are cool - cool enough, or I
wouldn't wear them. I don't sag
my pants like a little hoodlum any-
more, though.
My boxers have neat patterns on
them, usually. Most of them have
a checkered pattern of some kind.
But the nice ones have vertical
stripes. I can't explain it, but there's
something classy about vertical
stripes. Once my brother asked for
silk underwear for Christmas, and
they had vertical stripes, too. You
can't get silk underwear in check-
ered pattern, that's for damn sure.

Except now, suddenly, all of my
friends are wearing boxer briefs.
The happy medium between
tighty-whities and boxers. Should I
also be wearing them? Not that I'm
feeling undergarment-related peer
pressure, but I'm just wondering
if there's a benefit to boxer briefs.
Why the switch, guys? They look
too tight, too revealing, too uncom-
fortable. At the same time, they
seem like a more mature type of
underwear. It seems like the kind of
underwear that a twenty- or thirty-
something would wear. In fact, I'm
pretty sure that's the kind of under-
wear that my dad wears, and he's
fifty-something. The other day I
was consideringmakingthe change
to demonstrate an increased level
of maturity. A fake it till you make it
kind of thing. But at the same time,
I'm content with boxers. They're
comfortable, breezy. I like that. So
maybe I'll stick with them for now.

crowding in German universities. Because it's
really accessible, a lot of people study."
Rackham student Cristian Capotescu
received his history degree from the Univer-
sity of Freiburg in 2010. Lectures are not so
different in German schools than in the U.S.,
Capotescu described, with packed lecture
halls of hundreds of students.
Where differences existed were in semi-
nars and tutorials, the latter being something
like a class section with a greater emphasis on
learning how to better write, read, etc. Capo-
tescu said graduate students often teach semi-
nars, whereas here professors almost always
lead them. Stranger yet, undergraduates are
wont to teach these tutorials.
"The quality of those sections are a lot
lower," Capotescu said. "I certainly think
graduate students are more qualified to teach
those sections, but is it worth $40,000 a year?"
The ban on tuition in Germany was lifted in
2006. Following that, various German states
began issuing small semester fees to better its
quality of education. Canning said the hugely
unpopular tuition actually did not help condi-
tions at university.
"Either they just conceded that it wasn't
enough money to really do anything and it was
too controversial to even bother with it," Can-
ning said.
Capotescu agreed that 500 euros ($624.95)

continues investmoney in education, a mere 16
percent of the University's budget come from
state appropriations.
"The money we need grows and the money
we get shrinks," von Moltke said.
As recently as 1990, state funding and
tuition contributed equallyto the budget.
Capotescu noted issueswith a huge student
body, not unlike Germany.
"We assume that with American educa-
tion, you pay so much so it's better. When you
look closer at elite public higher education at
schools like Michigan, it's not a perfect world
or utopia," Capotescu said. "You still have 150
students in a lecture."
The increased tuition did encourage a state
of mind that does not exist in Germany. Amer-
ican college students view themselves as con-
sumers at the University; we spend a certain
amount of money and expect a certain qual-
ity of service. German collegiates, though, are
"student-citizens," von Moltke explained.
For instance, career advising is more or less
non-existent in Germany. Students can use
government offices for these things. In fact,
most services like housing and public trans-
portation for students are provided by the city
or state.
"Itsjob is to serve the public, not to treat its
students as clients," von Moltke said. "For bet-
ter and for worse, in the U.S., you are apaying

arly on a Saturday, students and faculty
boarded a bus outside the University's
School of Public Health. The destination
- Detroit.
However, this group wasn't going to visit the
tourist hotspots. While Eastern Market and the
Renaissance Center were on the itinerary, these
participants had signed up to see some of the
most polluted and industrialized areas of the
city, hear about the historic factors thatbrought
the city to its current state and to learn about
the public health concerns for residents in these
areas.
"Detroit's a challenging place - it's an inter-
esting place," said Sociology Prof. Reynolds Far-
ley, one of the trip leaders for the 2014 Tour of
Toxic Sites, sponsoredby the University's Center
for Occupational Health and Safety Engineering.
For better or worse, the city has for decades
been used as a case study for some of society's
most serious economic and social concerns.
From the collapse of the auto industry to the his-
tory of racial tensions, academicsuse Detroit as a
model for other similar U.S. cities.
The annual tour seeks to provide future pub-
lic health and social justice workers with a first-
hand look at contemporary issues, reflecting
the University's growing involvement - both
academically and socially - in the city in recent
years.
As thebus and its 30to 40passengers left Ann
Arbor, Farley began discussing the impact of the
city's history on the current environmental con-
cerns.
The rise ofanindustrial giant

Founded as a trading post in the early 16th
century, Detroit saw significant population and
industrial growth starting in 1855 with the com-
pletion of two major projects - a railroad con-
necting the city to New York and Chicago and
the completion of the locks at Sault Ste. Marie,
putting Detroit in the position to utilize Michi-
gan's industrial resources - white pine, iron ore
and copper - to become an industrial power-
house.
The Civil War spurred demand for such
industrial products, and the city grew from a
population of 21,000 in 1850 to almost 300,000
by 1900..
The industrial boom marked the start of
major pollution problems in the city and region.
Long before the era of government regula-
tion and oversight, manufacturers often simply
dumped industrial waste into the Detroit River
or let it soak into the ground around the plants
that produced them. Some of those toxic effects
can stillbe felttoday.
But any industrial 'boom' of the 19th century
pales in comparison with the growth of industry
in the early 20th century as Detroit gave birth to
the U.S. auto industry. The 'Big 3' automakers -
Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler - all set up
shop in the city.
In 1917, Ford Motor Co. began construction
on its River Rouge Complex, the single larg-
est industrial complex in the world at the time.
At its height, it employed more than 100,000
workers and still operates in a limited capac-
ity today, though it was sold by the Ford family
and has been downsized due to environmental
restrictions. The company now operates several
modern plants in the surrounding area and in

Dearborn.Accordingto the Sierra Club, anation-
al environmental preservation group founded
in 1892, these plants produced over 600,000
pounds of toxic pollutants in 2010, contributing
the "largest burden of environmental pollution"
in Detroit.
General Motors opened a Cadillac assembly
plant near Mexicantown in 1921 and later relo-
cated to their Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly
facility north of the city in 1985. The company
purchased the iconic waterfront Renaissance
Center in 1996 toserve asits worldheadquarters.
According to the Sierra Club, the Hamtramck
facility produced over 180,000 pounds of toxic
releases and over 240,000pounds of other waste
in 2010.
Farley noted that recognizing the city's his-
tory is vital to understanding its continuing
struggles.
"People don't spend a whole lot of time think-
ing about cities and how the history of cities,
when homes were built and factories were built,
how that influences the present," Farley said.
"But, they're open to thinking about it;they seem
to be interested."
The grassroots movement
After a brief tour of downtown and lunch at
Eastern Market, students and faculty boarded
the Toxic Tour bus for the main event - alook
at some of the most polluted and industrialized
areas of the city.
Charles Stokes works for Detroiters Work-
ing for Environmental Justice, an organization
partnered with the University's School of Public
Health, andjoined the bus tours to provide stu-_

dents with context from a local resident's per-
spective.
Stokes highlighted the pollution in Detroit as
an environmental justice issue. In his position,
he works as an organizer spreading the word
to afflicted neighborhoods about the dangers of
various toxic sites and unite people to pressure
the city to make changes.
Among the many locations on the tour's itin-
erary were the Rouge Steel Plant, the Marathon
Oil refinery, and the waste treatment plant.
Stokes explained how these locations contribute
to carbon dioxide levels and other forms of air
pollution, as well as producing harmful indus-
trial byproducts, such as petroleum coke, during
the process of refining raw tar sands - mostly
imported from Alberta, Canada - into oil.
The tour also visited the Detroit municipal
waste incinerator, a contentious topic in the
city for years and known forits infamous smell.
Stokes organized area residents to continu-
ally file odor complaints against the incinerator
based on reports that the smell has caused peo-
ple to feel nauseous and, in some cases, become
more seriously ill.
Opened in 1986, the waste incinerator is the
largest of its kind in the U.S., accommodating
over 3,000tons of garbage on a daily basis. Along
with the long-standing debate over the plant's
odor, the facility also emits airborne substances,
such as nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, and car-
bon monoxide, which have created public health
concernsin the community.
After the actions taken by residents and envi-
ronmental groups, Michigan's Department of
Environmental Quality brought suit against the
private company that now owns the incinerator.
In the past two weeks, the city passed a consent
agreement mandating the operators update the
incinerator's air ducts to reduce the odor within
two years or face a fine.
While the proceedings demonstrated the
ability of community groups to help rectify envi-
ronmental injustice in the city, the incinerator
is only one of many such facilities that are wor-
risome to residents. Stokes said there is still
plenty of work to be done, but that he is proud so

equality and participation of all peoples."
Environmental injustice
Historically, industry and residential areas
of Detroit were built in close proximity to one
another, as this made the most sense for work-
ers who needed to commute. Despite a modern
understanding of the environmental concerns
today, Farley said it can be difficult both politi-
cally and financially to relocate people away
from pollution sites.
Instead, residents and grassroots organizers
are working to have industry more strictly regu-
lated. So far, the results are mixed, as facilities
such as the Marathon Refinery have pledged to
reduce emissions, while at the same time con-
tinuing to increase their facility's output.
According to a report from the Detroit Alli-
ance for Asthma Awareness, rates of asthma in
the city are three times the national average.
Some have argued that Michigan's Department
of Environmental Quality and the U.S. Environ-
mental Protection Agency could be doing more
to regulate industries.
Furthermore, the Sierra Club contends that
the environmental impacts are not evenly dis-
tributed among the state's population. Citing
research from Natural Resources Prof. Paul
Mohai, the report indicates that over 80 percent
of African-American students attend school in
the top decile of polluted areas in the state, as
opposed to 44 percent of white students.
At the start of the auto boom in the 1920s,
Detroit's population was over 95 percent white.
The middle class thrived under the plethora of
skilled manufacturing jobs. By the end of the
20th century, however, the demographics had
undergone a massive shift. In 2010, Blacks made
upover 82 percent of residents.
While middle-class workers had the ability to
move to the suburbs or leave the city entirely,less
advantaged groups were left to deal with the fall-
out ofyears of environmental degradation.

In addition to industry,
Delray lies in the midst of
