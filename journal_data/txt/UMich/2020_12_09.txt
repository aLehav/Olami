The University of Michigan is 

prepared to begin administering 
Pfizer vaccines as early as 
Dec. 15 pending government 
authorization, school officials 
confirmed 
in 
the 
weekly 

COVID-19 
briefing 
Friday 

afternoon.

Anyone 
enrolled 
in 
the 

Pharmacy, 
Kinesiology, 

Nursing, 
Social 
Work 
and 

Medical schools who is exposed 
to patients will be included 
in the first phase of COVID-

19 
vaccine 
prioritization, 

according to Medical School 
professor Sandro Cinti. 

COVID-19 vaccines will be 

distributed in three phases, 
according to Cinti, who is also 
co-lead of Michigan Medicine’s 
COVID-19 
Vaccine 
and 

Therapeutics Task Force. 

Phase 1 will be administered 

in three parts. Phase 1A, set 
to begin Dec. 15 if the Pfizer 
vaccine 
receives 
emergency 

approval next week, includes 
health care personnel and long-
term care facility residents and 
staff. Pfizer has said the vaccine 
will be ready within hours after 
government authorization.

“We will start on the 15th 

— probably — of December in 
our phase one,” Cinti said. “We 
will ramp up as we get more 
vaccine. And we’re looking to 
start vaccinating people on the 
Hill in the hospital. And then we 
will also have off-site clinics in 
ambulatory care. Very quickly, 
we will move into Phase 1B, 
which includes the University.”

Phase 
1B 
will 
vaccinate 

essential workers in sectors 
like education, food, utilities 
and transportation, including 
members 
of 
the 
University 

community. Cinti said Robert 
Ernest, director of University 
Health 
Service, 
and 
other 

University 
personnel 
are 

working on how to distribute 
the vaccine to the campus and 
Ann Arbor communities. 

“1B 
is 
essential 
workers 

and this is why we added 
the 
University,” 
Cinti 
said. 

“(Getting) educators back to 
work, which includes K-12, the 
college campuses, is going to be 
important.”

Phase 1C includes senior 

citizens and others with high-
risk conditions. The components 
of Phase 1 are planned to begin 
about five weeks apart from 
each other and overlap. 

In May, LSA senior Bhoomika 

Gupta received a call that her 
internship was canceled due to 
COVID-19, similar to students 
across the country. Through 
networking, Gupta was able to 
successfully secure a virtual 
internship 
with 
a 
global 

nonprofit. 

Despite working this past 

summer, Gupta has not secured 
full-time employment. Gupta, 
who hopes to pursue a career 
in 
human 
resources, 
said 

the competitiveness of full-
time recruiting has only been 
worsened 
by 
the 
economic 

uncertainty of the pandemic. 

“People aren’t recruiting as 

easily,” Gupta said. “Companies 
that are recruiting are really 
large companies that are, of 
course, aggressively competitive 
this semester, because everyone 
knows that very few companies 
are hiring.”

According to Gupta, who 

hopes to work in business 
human resources, the pandemic 
has forced seniors interested 
in 
similar 
fields 
to 
adjust 

their expectations and their 
recruiting timeline. 

“The Michigan norm is you 

recruit first semester, you’re 
done, second semester you get to 
relax and then you’re working. 
But this year, it’s going to be more 
of second-semester recruiting 
or at least until December, 
which is an interesting mental 
game,” Gupta said. “I think for 

many students, because you feel 
behind your peers, you feel like 
you’re not doing enough.” 

The 
University 
recently 

announced 
its 
plan 
for 

the 
winter 
term, 
which 

acknowledged 
unprecedented 

stressors students are facing 
and emphasized the importance 
of 
mental 
health. 
Though 

the 
search 
for 
professional 

opportunities 
against 
the 

backdrop of the pandemic has 
not been easy for many, the 
plan did not include anything 
specifically 
pertaining 
to 

enhanced 
career-related 

services. 

Kelly 
Day, 
an 
internship 

program manager at the LSA 
Opportunity 
Hub, 
said 
the 

office has various resources for 
students seeking internships. 
She 
pointed 
to 
the 
LSA 

Opportunity Network where 
internships are posted daily. 

“(We’re) trying to provide all 

the support that we can, and 
letting students know that it’s 
okay wherever you’re at in the 
situation, and it’s pretty normal 
to have some of these questions 
and concerns,” Day said. 

Limited job options have 

caused Gupta to contemplate 
alternative 
post-graduate 

opportunities such as graduate 
school. 

“I know something will work 

out,” Gupta said. “I’ve started 
thinking about grad school as 
well, because I’d rather be safe. 
Grad school was not something 
that was even in my plans for at 
least another five or six years.”

ELIZABETH WILLIAMS 

For The Daily 

Three Washtenaw County 

business owners have teamed 
up to found the Association of 
Businesses of Color. The ABC 
provides aid to businesses 
owned by people of color 
that are struggling with the 
economic downturn brought 
on by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The ABC was created by 

Brian Jones-Chance, Patton 

Doyle 
and 
Ylondia 
Portis, 

business owners and members 
of the Downtown Development 
Board in Ypsilanti, to address 
the 
economic 
disparities 

between businesses owned by 
white people and those owned 
by people of color in the area.

“A lot of businesses have 

closed 
permanently, 
and 

staffing is another issue,” 
Jones-Chance, 
co-founder 

of 734 Brewing, said. “Many 
of our remaining businesses 
have found it difficult to keep 

teams employed, the revenue 
issue stemming from reduced 
hours or reduced capacity or 
both.” 

As 
businesses 
adapt 
to 

another 
round 
of 
forced 

closures, 
members 
of 
the 

ABC have focused on how 
business owners of color in 
particular are handling the 
new restrictions. 

When 
county 
leaders 

declared 
racism 
a 
public 

health crisis this summer, 
they noted that Washtenaw 

was 80th out of 83 counties 
in 
Michigan 
for 
income 

inequality 
according 
to 
a 

2020 ranking. Black residents 
have been disproportionately 
impacted by COVID-19.

A 
new 
grant 
will 
be 

introduced on Dec. 15 to 
support 
businesses 
that 

closed in response to the most 
recent state order. The ABC 
is working to ensure equal 
access to this grant. 

2020 
marks 
the 
50th 

anniversary of the University 
of 
Michigan 
Department 
of 

Afroamerican 
and 
African 

Studies within LSA. DAAS is 
committed to African studies and 
conducting research to support 
the broader African and African 
American communities.

Throughout the 1960s, Black 

student 
organizations 
joined 

together as the Black Action 
Movement, 
demanding 
racial 

justice at the University. In 1968, 
BAM 
organized 
on-campus 

protests to urge the University to 
increase Black enrollment to 10%. 
Among BAM’s achievements was 
the creation of an Afroamerican 
and African Studies Program, 
which later became DAAS.

As 
a 
product 
of 
social 

activism 
at 
the 
University, 

DAAS was founded upon the 
principles of diversity, equity and 
inclusion, according to Matthew 
Countryman, DAAS department 
chair and associate professor. 
Since then, these foundational 
principles have been integrated 
into 
DAAS’s 
undergraduate 

major and minor in addition to its 
graduate certificate program. 

Countryman 
said 
the 

department seeks to create a safe 
space for students and values 

inclusivity greatly.

“We can be a home for students, 

whatever their major or however 
many courses they take with us. 
We can be a place that affirms 
their presence and values their 
presence on campus in ways that, 
unfortunately, they don’t always 
experience in their other classes,” 
Countryman said. “That’s crucial 
to our mission and something 
that all of our staff and faculty are 
aware of on a daily basis.”

LSA senior Thomas Vance, 

an AAS major, said this 50th 
anniversary is a testament to 
what Black activism can achieve.

“The 50th anniversary, to 

me, is just a celebration and a 
highlight of what happens when 
Black students fight for change,” 
Vance explained. “It’s something 
I’m 
always 
thankful 
for. 
I 

don’t think that my Michigan 
experience would be as positive 
without DAAS.”

LSA senior Tiffany Harris, 

also an AAS major, found that 
DAAS faculty foster a welcoming 
environment where students of 
color feel comfortable discussing 
race in the classroom. 

“In a lot of political science 

classes, I’ll be the only Black 
girl, and it’s uncomfortable to 
have to fight for the whole Black 
community consistently in class,” 
Harris noted.

With a more stringent, 

fully-online winter semester 
on 
the 
horizon, 
students 

will continue dealing with 
mental 
health 
struggles 

due to isolation. Because 
of this, the University of 
Michigan’s Counseling and 
Psychological Services plans 
to increase resources.

CAPS Director Todd Sevig 

said the office is adding 
“new services in addition to 
individual counseling that 
students can utilize.”

“We 
have 
received 

increased 
allocations 
for 

additional staff for Winter 
and beyond,” Sevig wrote. 
“So, yes we are making some 
changes for the rest of this 
semester and for Winter to 
better meet current needs.”

Sevig 
said 
they 
have 

filled 
half 
of 
the 
new 

counseling positions and are 
collaborating with University 
students, 
administration 

and other Big 10 counseling 
centers to use the remaining 
funds most effectively. 

“We have actually filled 

4 of the new 8 positions and 
they started this fall,” Sevig 
wrote. “The 4 new ones we 
have filled have helped us 
provide more services in our 
embedded model. We are 
actively considering the best 
way to allocate service with 

the remaining 4 positions — 
both short term for winter 
and longer term for beyond 
this year.”

The 
embedded 
model 

aims to install at least one 
full-time, specialized social 
worker or psychologist in 
each University school. 

While 
wait 
times 
for 

initial consultations with a 
counselor are currently only 
2-3 days, these wait times 
have 
varied 
significantly 

this fall. Throughout the 
semester, students reported 
increased 
feelings 
of 

isolation and mental health 
struggles, raising concerns 
that resources at CAPS could 
be stretched thin. Students 
faced 
long 
wait 
times 

even before the COVID-19 
pandemic. 

In 
an 
email 
to 
The 

Michigan Daily, Sevig said 
most wait times during the 
semester were usually “1.5-
2.5 weeks” but that CAPS 
has 
seen 
“unpredicted 

surges 
in 
demand” 
since 

mid-October. Sevig said the 
increase in demand is caused 
by the challenges students 
are experiencing with the 
COVID-19 pandemic. 

“We’re 
devoting 
every 

available resource to meet 
the need because we don’t 
want the wait to be that 
long,” Sevig wrote.

To facilitate mental health 

and well-being for the winter 
term, the university also 
announced two mid-week, 
one-day “well-being breaks” 

without 
any 
scheduled 

academic activities on Feb. 
24 and March 23.

LSA sophomore Ashley Ke 

said she used CAPS this fall, 
but felt there was a stigma 
around seeking professional 
help for mental health. Ke 
said 
CAPS 
provided 
her 

short-term relief from the 
everyday 
stresses 
of 
the 

pandemic. 

“I feel like in general, 

people seeking professional 
help are very stigmatized, 
and I think it’s been slowly 
getting better in terms of 
being talked about more,” 
Ke said. “I think in terms 
of just getting my feelings 
out 
about 
being 
stressed 

about 
classes 
because 
of 

COVID, 
or 
relationships 

and friendships, a lot of 
which has been exacerbated 
because of COVID, CAPS has 
been helpful.”

Ke 
said 
mostly 
online 

classes and social distancing 
precautions 
have 
affected 

her mental health.

“I’m 
very 
safe 
about 

following 
guidelines 
and 

so I don’t really leave my 
room, which definitely has 
consequences,” 
Ke 
said. 

“It’s hard to do work in the 
same place that you sleep 
and eat, and also I think it’s 
really forced a lot of us to 
confront holding ourselves 
accountable.”

CAPS 
uses 
an 
online 

scheduling 
system 
where 

students can sign up for 
appointments. 
Throughout 

this semester, students have 
experienced 
varying 
wait 

times for appointments with 
counselors. 

Ke, who scheduled her 

initial consultation online at 
the beginning of the semester 
in mid-September, said her 
experience went smoothly. 
The 
system 
allowed 
her 

to 
schedule 
bi-weekly 

appointments and the short 
wait times surprised her.

“I was pretty surprised 

because they got back to 
me pretty quickly,” Ke said. 
“They had more availability 
than I thought they would, at 
least from what I’ve heard in 
the past from talking to other 
students.”

Some students attempting 

to 
schedule 
consultations, 

especially 
later 
in 
the 

semester, have had a different 
experience 
— 
finding 
no 

immediate availability and 
wait times longer than a 
month. 

LSA freshman Ava Ben-

David sought out CAPS this 
fall due to the constantly 
changing 
nature 
of 
the 

semester, which included a 
stay-in-place order and the 
closure of residence halls for 
the winter term.

“I sought some counseling, 

just someone to talk to, 
because this semester has 
been so crazy and there’s 
been a lot of changes,” Ben-
David said.

The Michigan Daily’s seniors, class of 2020, bid farewell outside 420 Maynard.


Phase 2 is set to begin in 

the late winter or early spring 
and will extend to the broader 
University community. A start 
date for Phase 3 has not been 
announced.

General 
students 
will 

likely be in the second phase 
of the vaccine’s distribution, 
unless they are high risk, 
which could move them to 
the first phase, Cinti said. 
He expects the University to 
vaccinate about 80,000 U-M 
community members in the 
coming months. Two doses 

are required for one person to 
be vaccinated in the process, 
which Cinti described as quick 
but safe. 

“Will we get (completely 

vaccinated) before the fall 
semester?” Cinti said. “I can’t 
tell you that. I don’t know, but 
maybe we’ll have the teachers 
protected. We can’t rip off our 
masks right away — we have to 
wait — but teachers might feel 
better about teaching.”

University President Mark 

Schlissel said there is no plan 
to require U-M community 
members to be vaccinated, 
though it might be considered 
in the future.

“It’s gonna be a situation 

where the vaccine is limited in 

dose, and if I’ve got people that 
want to take it that are in risk 
groups — that are frontline 
health care providers, that 
are our faculty dealing with 
students, people that have 
actual risk — I’m gonna give 
it to them rather than forcing 
people who are unwilling,” 
Schlissel said.

When Michigan Medicine 

delivers 
a 
vaccine, 
that 

information 
will 
be 

incorporated in the state’s 
vaccine registry within 24 
hours, 
according 
to 
Dana 

Habers, 
chief 
radiology 

department 
administrator. 

Habers 
said 
multiple 

reminders will go out to 
patients 
to 
ensure 
people 

come back for the second dose 
weeks laters.

Arnold 
Monto, 
professor 

of epidemiology at the School 
of 
Public 
Health, 
is 
the 

chair of the Food and Drug 
Administration’s 
committee 

evaluating COVID-19 vaccines. 
His committee, which works to 
approve the efficacy and safety 
of potential candidate vaccines, 
will meet on Dec. 10 and 17 to 
discuss the Pfizer and Moderna 
vaccines, respectively. In a 
recent 
interview 
with 
The 

Michigan Daily, Monto said 
the risk of taking a COVID-19 
vaccine once one is approved 
will be no greater than other 
regular vaccines.

“This 
vaccine 
will 
have 

been approved by the standard 
mechanism,” 
Monto 
said. 

“By 
the 
time 
the 
vaccine 

becomes 
available 
to 
the 

general population it will have 
standard, 
non-emergency 

approval.”

Michigan 
Medicine 
has 

partnered 
with 
companies 

leading the pack in the race 
for 
a 
COVID-19 
vaccine 

trials, including Janssen and 
AstraZeneca. A week after 
the AstraZeneca partnership 
was introduced, the trial was 
momentarily paused after an 
adverse reaction was observed 
in a participant. It was later 
resumed.

Fifty-eight percent of adults 

aged 50 to 80 say they are 

somewhat or very likely to get 
vaccinated to prevent COVID-
19, according to a University 
Institute for Healthcare Policy 
and Innovation poll taken in 
September. Schlissel said he 
will want to “roll up” his sleeve 
as soon as he is eligible to 
receive the vaccine.

“Without 
a 
doubt, 

vaccination is the number one 
most 
effective 
intervention 

medicine has ever developed,” 
Schlissel said. “The amount of 
human suffering that’s been 
mitigated through vaccinations 
is unimaginable.”

“I really value DAAS because 

not many majors allow me to 
sit in a room with people that 
look like me and discuss Black 
resistance, Black freedom and 
Black anything while being 
comfortable in our Blackness.”

Outside the classroom, DAAS 

works to establish a close-knit 
and welcoming community for 
students of color and the student 
body. By coordinating events 
with student organizations, the 
DAAS faculty hopes to teach 
students to understand their 
cultural and racial differences. 
Though many of their 50th 
anniversary 
events 
were 

canceled due to the COVID-19 
pandemic, the department has 
adapted this semester to host 
virtual events to celebrate the 
milestone.

DAAS 
associate 
professor 

Omolade 
Adunbi 
said 
the 

department’s greatest strength 
is 
its 
synergy 
between 

academics 
and 
community, 

including communities beyond 
the University. Adunbi pointed 
to the Semester in Detroit 
program 
as 
one 
example, 

which 
allows 
students 
to 

engage in substantive urban 
planning that benefits Detroit 
communities. 
Similarly, 
the 

Pedagogy of Action program 
has empowered students to 
learn about the impact of HIV 
and AIDS on African American 

communities 
and 
teach 

prevention in the metro Detroit 
area and Ypsilanti, Mich. 

According 
to 
Adunbi, 

DAAS’s 
most 
expansive 

outreach 
program 
is 
its 

African Presidential Scholars 
Program. In collaboration with 
the African Studies Center, 
DAAS invites scholars from 
across Africa to the University. 
Collectively, DAAS’s outreach 
programs 
exemplify 
the 

department’s growing reach 
to 
both 
local 
and 
global 

communities.

Countryman 
said 
DAAS 

provides the most integral 
component of social activism: 
education. By learning about 
historical 
and 
present-day 

instances 
of 
inequality, 

students 
can 
begin 
to 

confront 
these 
injustices. 

Whether they advocate for 
change 
on 
social 
media, 

donate to charitable causes 
or work with policymakers to 
propose beneficial legislation, 
Countryman said students in 
DAAS gain the knowledge and 
fervor necessary to enact real-
world change.

“I think education provides a 

crucial opportunity for people 
to be honest about both the 
promise of society and promise 
of the institution, but also to 
confront and look directly at 
where we’ve come up short 
in terms of those promises — 
ways in which the nation and 
institutions have been built 
off structures of inequality,” 

Countryman said. “By itself, 
education can’t change those 
structures; but without that 
commitment to understanding 
and investigating, we’re not 
going to make progress toward 
the goals of a just society.”

As important as it is to 

reflect upon the past, Adunbi 
said this milestone serves as 
an opportunity to also consider 
DAAS’s future.

“We’re not just remembering 

the founders, but we are also 
thinking 
about 
the 
future 

of Black studies in general,” 
Adunbi said. “It’s like looking 
back, taking a pause to evaluate 
where we have come from and 
what we are currently doing, 
and then looking into the 
future of Black studies.”

Vance said he hopes the 

department 
continues 
to 

promote the study of Black 
communities 
and 
facilitate 

their success.

“I hope DAAS continues to 

thrive, continues to innovate 
and continues to hire professors 
and postdoctoral fellows who 
are really committed to the 
study of the diaspora and 
members of the diaspora,” 
Vance said. “As for the Black 
community, I really just want 
to see everybody win. I just 
want to see everybody succeed 
where they are, continue to 
dream big, continue to aspire 
for greatness and get there.”

But 
seniors 
applying 
to 

graduate or professional school 
have 
also 
faced 
pandemic-

related challenges. LSA senior 
Yebin Lee spent her summer 
applying to dental school and 
had to scramble to find a new 
testing center for her canceled 
Dental Admission Test. 

Additionally, Lee’s summer 

job as a dental assistant was 
canceled, which has impacted a 
crucial component of her dental 
school applications. 

“I was supposed to work out 

in a dental office in Manhattan, 
and obviously everywhere in 
Manhattan got closed down 
because New York was having 
such a bad COVID crisis. So, I 
couldn’t work out there, and it 
was actually kind of a disaster 

for me,” Lee said. “I really 
needed 
experience, 
because 

they do require about a hundred 
hours of work experience.” 

Lee originally planned to 

graduate next semester, but 
she’s now going to graduate in 
December in order to work as a 
dental assistant. 

“If I graduate this semester, 

then I could work for about six 
months and then go to grad 
school, because I know grad 
schools are expensive,” Lee said. 
“I figured I should definitely 
do that before I can’t afford it 
anymore.”

Some students who graduated 

right at the onset of the pandemic 
are also still searching. After 
graduation in May, University 
alum Mary Rose Clark decided 
to take the summer off from 
applying to jobs due to COVID-
19 hiring freezes. 

Since 
late 
August, 
she’s 

been actively looking for full-
time 
opportunities 
in 
the 

philanthropy or development 
space, but she has not yet 
secured full-time employment. 
Clark said many of her peers 
who graduated in May have also 
been unable to secure full-time 
employment. 

“I’ve applied to numerous 

things. I’ve begun networking, 
especially in the past month, 
with lots of people around 
west Michigan and still have 
not 
heard 
anything 
back,” 

Clark said. “I’ve gotten mostly 
rejections, which I’ve heard that 
that’s very common, though, 
most people that I’ve talked to 
haven’t really heard back from 
anyone.” 

LSA 
senior 
Mackensie 

Freeman spent her summer 
working for a public relations 
agency 
based 
in 
Atlanta. 

Like Gupta, she secured this 

internship through networking 
after many of her other second-
round interviews and offers 
were canceled.

Freeman has continued to 

work for this agency throughout 
the school year but said she 
feels she missed out on the full 
internship experience. 

“I definitely missed out on 

that whole aspect of corporate 
culture and getting to know 
your work, your coworkers,” 
Freeman said. 

With 
the 
timeline 
for 

returning 
to 
offices 
still 

uncertain, 
Day 
said 
she 

recognizes that the difficulty 
in 
securing 
an 
internship 

and working virtually will be 
prevalent this summer. 

“Based on what happened 

last summer, there’s still a 
lot of questions around. ‘Is 
this internship going to move 
forward in a virtual format?’” 

Day said. “Also, (students are 
still) thinking about, ‘If I am 
going to do a virtual internship, 
how can I make the most of it?’”

Employers have also had to 

adjust their hiring practices 
this year, especially with virtual 
career fairs. This was not ideal 
for some students as one-on-
one meetings with recruiters 
filled up fast, adding to the 
competitiveness of recruiting. 
The COVID-19 crisis has been 
unique in the sense that some 
industries and companies have 
been devastated, while others 
have thrived, leaving students 
unsure about the shifting job 
opportunities. While research 
opportunities 
for 
students 

have struggled, graduates have 
still been able to find remote 
opportunities.

However, Day said she has 

heard from employers that they 
are better prepared this year for 

virtual internships, as they have 
had more time to plan. 

“Of 
course, 
last 
summer 

everything kind of happened 
in March, so it was a little bit 
of a time crunch to figure out 
what to do if you had planned 
on having in-person interns,” 
Day said. “(This summer), they 
are usually planning for at least 
a virtual option if in-person 
isn’t 
possible, 
depending 

on the vaccine timeline and 
everything.”

Freeman says the process has 

been stressful and has forced 
her to come up with a range of 
back-up options. 

“I’m just nervously checking 

LinkedIn,” Freeman said. “My 
mom also is having me applying 
to a grad program just in case 
everything fails.”

“There’s no element of that 

grant program that targets 
business 
centers 
of 
color,” 

Doyle said. “This particular 
program is going to be first-
come, first-served, and so you 
can imagine that those people 
who are not as connected are 
much less likely to get access.” 

The 
ABC 
has 
gained 

momentum, 
with 
over 
30 

Washtenaw County businesses 
joining 
the 
organization. 

Jones-Chance said the ABC is 
looking to continue its work 
after the COVID-19 pandemic 
ends.

“My goal is to just include 

an educated and influential 
and plugged-in membership,” 
Jones-Chance 
said. 
“We 

hope that (ABC members) all 
have thriving and successful 
businesses, we want them to 
have access to funding, but to 
also become some of the folks 
who make these decisions.”

It 
is 
easier 
for 
some 

businesses 
to 
adjust 
to 
a 

COVID-19-safe 
environment 

than others. Jones-Chance said 
734 Brewing has established 
a beer delivery system that 
keeps customer relationships 
and a sense of community 
intact through the pandemic.

“We have happily complied 

with all the state orders to keep 
the community safe and our 
staff safe, so we’ve had to make 
some changes,” Jones-Chance 
said. “In such a social business, 
people 
who 
come 
in 
are 

generally looking to socialize 
and it’s been challenging to 
maintain those relationships 
with our customers.” 

In 
May, 
the 
Michigan 

Economic 
Development 

Corporation released a grant-
fund program called Match-
on-Main that supports small 
businesses 
in 
areas 
like 

Ypsilanti and Ann Arbor with 
main 
streets 
experiencing 

less foot traffic than usual. 
This program went through 
the Downtown Development 
Board to provide grants to 
local businesses. 

“I 
found 
that 
it 
was 

inconsistent with the group of 
people … and their businesses 
that are in the district here,” 
Doyle 
said. 
“And 
it 
was 

concerning to me, and of 
course this is in the middle of a 
broader national conversation 
and 
protests 
about 
racial 

justice.” 

Jones-Chance said the ABC 

helps connect businesses of 
color to sources of funding that 
may help them survive repeat 
closures.

“The grant fund allocation 

didn’t appear to be intentional, 
and so we set out to help plug 
more businesses of color into 
the pre-existing sources of 
funding,” Jones-Chance said. 
“And over time we’ve begun 
to see some other areas where 
we can be of use. So more 
education, helping members 
gain more influence in the 
community and over some of 
these funding decisions.”

Jones-Chance cites lack of 

access to capital as the main 
struggle for people of color 
who own businesses.

“The main difficulties of 

being a business owner come 
from 
the 
same 
systematic 

social issues as difficulties 
of being just a person of color 
or being a racial minority,” 
Jones-Chance 
said. 
“In 

business, that kind of takes 
the shape of rugged, economic 
individualism 
for 
people 

of 
color 
but 
government-

sponsored support for white 
counterparts.” 

Jones-Chance 
said 
the 

G.I. 
Bill, 
which 
provides 

financial 
assistance 
to 

veterans, is an example of 
how the U.S. government 
denied thousands of Black 
World War II veterans access 
to 
higher 
education 
and 

resources.

“A lot of folks are able to 

build wealth over time to 
start 
businesses, 
whereas 

we’re intentionally excluded 
from 
that,” 
Jones-Chance 

said. “That access to capital 
and that systemic advantage 
we just don’t have, and so 
even 
when 
things 
aren’t 

intentional now, they’re sort 

of built on that foundation 
and it can make capitalizing 
your 
business 
extremely 

difficult.”

Music, Theatre & Dance 

freshman Maya Boyd, who 
frequently uses Instagram 
to encourage her followers 
to support businesses owned 
by 
people 
of 
color, 
said 

the dual impact of racial 
discrimination and COVID-
19 has put these companies in 
a difficult position.

“In Michigan, for instance, 

Black people were 40 percent 
of 
the 
reported 
(COVID-

19) 
deaths, 
while 
only 

making up 14 percent of the 
state’s 
population,” 
Boyd 

said. “Adding all the other 
obstacles 
of 
owning 
and 

maintaining businesses that 
people of color will inherently 
face in comparison to non-
minority 
owned 
businesses 

I feel says it all. And when 
there are issues that non-
minority 
owned 
businesses 

are able to face, it will always 
disproportionately 
affect 

POC-owned business due to 

the structural systems that are 
ingrained in this country.”

Doyle 
said 
that 
while 

Ann Arbor is often viewed 
as 
a 
progressive 
city, 

discrimination is still very 
much present and impacts 
business owners of color.

“I think it’s easy to look 

at Ann Arbor and say, ‘Oh 
well, you know, we’ve solved 
all these problems that exist 
out there in the real world,’” 
Doyle said. “And the truth is, 
of course, it couldn’t be further 
from the truth.”

Boyd 
said 
she 
believes 

organizations like the ABC 
can help Washtenaw County 
better support businesses run 
by people of color.

“There is so much room for 

growth,” Boyd said. “These 
kinds of organizations are so 
important because I feel like 
they have a lot of potential and 
there is a lot to benefit from 
locally having more diverse 
businesses.”

“It was getting stressful 

so I just wanted to talk to 
someone at CAPS, and I 
thought it would be a super 
seamless process.”

For Ben-David, the process 

was not simple and long wait 
times dissuaded her from 
going to CAPS.

“When I went on the 

website and I saw that I had 
to basically wait a month for 
the next available time slot, 
I was like, ‘this is not worth 

it,’ and I just never actually 
received the type of care that 
I was expecting from the 
University,” Ben-David said.

During 
the 
pandemic, 

administrative 
support 
of 

mental health services is 
even more pressing. 

Ben-David said changes 

to 
the 
“normal” 
college 

experience have presented 
challenges to freshmen and 
hindered people’s abilities to 
form friendships.

“This is not how we should 

be 
entering 
college, 
but 

obviously there’s nothing we 
can do about it so we just have 

to try our best,” Ben-David 
said. 
“Generally 
feeling 

isolated has definitely taken 
a toll on everyone’s mental 
health — I don’t think I’m 
the only one for sure.”

Ke said the University 

increasing 
support 
for 

CAPS would go a long way 
in expanding their ability 
to provide the services that 
students expect. 

“I 
definitely 
think, 
in 

general, the administration 
should be investing more 
in 
CAPS,” 
Ke 
said. 
“I 

don’t think a lot of it is 
necessarily 
their 
fault 
— 

they’re 
just 
understaffed 

and underfunded and there 
needs to be more resources 
invested in them because it’s 
just so important.”

Sevig wrote that the new 

positions CAPS filled in the 
fall increased their presence 
in 18 out of 19 schools and 
colleges at the University, 
adding four new sites. 

The 2020-2021 University 

budget 
for 
counseling 

services is nearly 3 million 
dollars, about 0.03% of the 
total 
Ann 
Arbor 
campus 

budget for the current fiscal 
year. The counseling services 

funding comes out of the 
general fund for University 
expenditures and represents 
about 0.1% of the general 
fund. 

This 
year’s 
CAPS 

expenditures are identical 
to 
the 
budget 
for 
2019-

2020 which was an almost 
$800,000 decrease from the 
previous fiscal year. 

Ben-David 
said 
she 

felt 
disappointed 
by 
the 

University 
as 
well 
as 

confused by how resources 
are allocated with regards to 
mental health services. 

“When 
I 
saw 
that 
I 

couldn’t even see someone 
just to talk to for 15 minutes, 
I was so frustrated because I 
thought that it should not be 
this complicated,” Ben-David 
said. 
“The 
school 
boasts 

about how many resources 
they have and how students 
are really cared about, but 
when I saw the ridiculous 
amount of time I had to wait 
— it was clearly not working 
out.”

When my mother emphatically 

woke me up at 1 a.m. and claimed 
that I might die from a pulmonary 
embolism, I didn’t know how to 
react. Moreover, I didn’t know 
what I could do. I was laying on 
my bed with my right leg elevat-
ed over almost every pillow we 
owned to combat the swelling that 
came with a torn ACL. At first, I 
rolled my eyes at what seemed to 
be the classic WebMD diagnosis. 
However, there was a confidence 
and fear in her voice that indicated 
to me that she didn’t have a doubt 
in her mind. As this sunk in, the 
thought of not waking up made it 
near impossible to go to sleep. At 
age 20, death wasn’t something I 
had thought about a lot.

-----

I tore my ACL on Aug. 1, 2019. 

The reason why I remember this 
date is because it was conveniently 
three weeks before I had signed up 
to take the MCAT. It took seeing 
three different specialists over the 
span of a week before I could get 
an MRI which confirmed the tear. 
With a certain diagnosis comes a 
strange sense of relief. While I had 
received the news that I had a seri-
ous knee injury, I suddenly could 
see a way forward. I scheduled an 
appointment with my surgeon for 
a consultation and then with that 
I’d begin my road to recovery. Over 
this period of time I continued to 
study for MCAT. For a whole sum-
mer I labored over a standardized 
test that is as long as a flight to 
Europe while a lot of my friends 
actually took flights to Europe 
to study abroad. I didn’t want my 
efforts to go to waste and was stub-
bornly hell-bent to take this exam. 
Strangely enough something that 
had given me a great deal of stress 
earlier that summer now acted as 
a way to displace the stress that 
came with my health. 

For a while, I truly believed that 

I’d be able to get away with this. 
I felt like Michael Jordan play-
ing through the flu in the 1997 
NBA finals. I found time to study 
interspersed between the multiple 
doctors appointments that I went 
to. With a pair of crutches, MCAT 
study materials, ibuprofen and a 
ridiculous amount of pillows, I felt 
invincible. Until a week later. My 
injured leg had gone completely 
numb halfway through a practice 
exam I was taking. I felt pins and 
needles start from my calf and 
make its way up my leg. At first I 
thought that my foot had fallen 
asleep or I was just nervous about 
the practice test. However, by the 
time I had finished I was sweat-
ing and breathing as if I had run a 
marathon. 

-----

A 
pulmonary 
embolism 
is 

when a blood clot that forms on 
the inside of your vein dislodges 
and ultimately makes its way to 
the arteries of the lungs through 
the pulmonary circulation. If the 
embolus is big enough then cardiac 
arrest is almost immediate. Even if 
you get lucky and don’t die imme-
diately, you will die eventually if 
the blood clot remains undetected.

-----

It was based on the symptoms 

from my practice exam that my 
mom announced my impending 
doom. Usually in the case of life 
or death emergencies, one would 

call 911. However, we somehow 
decided that a panicked email to 
my doctor and a call to UHS for 
reassurance would suffice. The 
combination of being left on hold 
for 30 minutes, the UHS nurse’s 
reassurance that I didn’t have a 
blood clot and general fatigue was 
enough for me to go back to sleep 
-- I was willing to accept any good 
news at that point. 

This interaction all seemed like 

a dream but I was reminded of its 
reality when I woke up to a phone 
call from my doctor who ordered 
me to come to the hospital imme-
diately to get an ultrasound of my 
leg. In no time, I found myself on 
a hospital bed with a nurse taking 
an ultrasound image of my injured 
leg. There was an incredibly tense 
moment of silence with the nurse 
staring at the imaging screen, my 
mother staring at me and me star-
ing at the nurse trying to read the 
reflection of the ultrasound moni-
tor off his glasses. Ultimately, he 
swung the monitor around and 
showed me the image of the blood 
clot that totally occluded my right 
gastrocnemius vein — a Deep 
Vein Thrombosis. This complica-
tion meant that I had to be put on 
blood thinners for three months in 
order for the clot to dissolve before 
I could get surgery on my knee to 
repair my torn ACL.

-----

There have been very few 

moments in my life where I felt 
like I had no control over what was 
happening to me: this was one of 
them. I remember trying to des-
perately negotiate with my doctor 
if there was any possibility I could 
do a shorter course of blood thin-
ners. It wasn’t possible and at this 
I felt hopeless. Usually in response 
to adversity, I’d try to make a plan 
and could usually see the light at 
the end of the tunnel. However, 
as a college student, I could bare-
ly make a plan for the next two 
weeks. How was I supposed to just 
wait for three months? Also given 
the seemingly unpredictability of 
my recent health, how did I know 
something else wouldn’t hap-
pen that would further delay my 
surgery? This is the anxiety and 
paranoia that lived in my mind 
rent free. I started my summer by 
preparing for an exam that would 
help me become a doctor and save 
lives, but I ended the summer as a 
patient on crutches.

I also started to resent the 

whole pre-medical process. For an 
entire summer, I crammed a whole 
college education’s worth of mate-
rial, I stressed out over not doing 
well on practice tests and then 
became a compulsive MCAT red-
dit checker, which didn’t do any 
favors to my anxiety. This vicious 
cycle consumed my mind over the 
summer. As days went by and my 
practice test scores didn’t improve, 
I found myself fighting an uphill 
battle with doubt. I started to 
doubt my ability as a student and 
also if I had what it took to pur-
sue the rather daunting task of 
becoming a doctor. I was not just 
in pain physically but I was also 
mentally exhausted. The fact that 
I wouldn’t even get the chance to 
at least try to take the exam that I 
had put so much time and energy 
into broke my spirit. Though a lot 
of friends and family tried to reach 
out to me and offered their conso-
lation, I truly felt alone. 

-----

With a deep vein thrombosis 

diagnosis, I was referred to a hema-
tologist who is essentially a blood 
specialist that would be managing 
my treatment. This was the fourth 
doctor I had seen in the span of 2-3 
weeks. It was quite rare for people 
to get blood clots at my age. I was 
also told that a torn ACL puts me at 
risk of getting osteoporosis earlier. 
These continual reminders made 
me feel like I wasn’t a 20 year old. I 
had never been to the department 
of hematology, but as we arrived at 
the waiting room and noticed that 
it was in the cancer center, a famil-
iar yet sorrowful feeling took over 
me as my mother turned a bit pale. 

My mother moved to the United 

States in 1995, and when she tried 
to start a family with my father in 
1998, she received two pieces of 
information from her doctor. The 
first was that she was pregnant 
with me, and the second was that 
she had been diagnosed with a rare 
form of blood cancer called chron-
ic myelogenous leukemia. She had 
the option of getting an abortion 
and starting her treatment as soon 
as possible, however she chose to 
go ahead with the pregnancy and 
wait to get treated. Cancer treat-
ments in the 90s weren’t the most 
refined at the time, so as soon 
as she had given birth to me she 
underwent a pretty rigorous che-
motherapy treatment. Luckily, my 
younger aunt turned out to be a 
perfect donor for a bone marrow 
transplant, and she’s been cancer 
free for 20 years. Though I don’t 
have any conscious memories of 
my mother going through chemo-
therapy, I have always had this 
indirect relationship with can-
cer as I would always accompany 
my mother to her post-treatment 
checkups when I was younger. 

-----

As soon as I got to the office, I 

was reminded of where we were. 
I was seated in a waiting room of 
cancer patients. Many of them 
used walkers to combat the fatigue 
that comes with the treatment of 
cancer. Many bald heads had swol-
len faces, which are common side 
effects of chemotherapy. My moth-
er had told me that as a little kid, I 
was a source of joy whenever she’d 
bring me to the waiting room of 
her appointments. In what seemed 
like a parallel of years prior, I 
watched a little kid walk around 
the room and introduce himself to 
everyone. It was both heartbreak-
ing and admirable to watch my 
mother put on a brave face. I don’t 
think she could have ever imag-
ined that after risking her own life 
to give me mine, we would be back 
in the same waiting room, but this 
time I was the patient. There was 
a moment where I met the gaze of 
a row of cancer patients, and fear 
surged into me. I stared at them 
and couldn’t help but frown. They 
stared at me and my hair and then 
also frowned. In that moment, we 
had come to an unspoken common 
understanding 
that 
something 

was wrong and that I didn’t belong 
there. 

Shortly afterwards, a frail elder 

woman wearing a red head scarf 
made her way from across the 
room and started talking to me. 
After patiently probing and trying 
to get me to open up, the woman 
asked me what was wrong and 
that’s when I told her this whole 
story. I told her about my ambition 
and dream to become a doctor. I 
told her about the cancer research 
that I’m involved in and that I was 

studying 
biomedical 
engineer-

ing. But I also told her that I was 
scared, that I had started my sum-
mer with all of these plans for my 
future, but now I was living at the 
mercy of fate and navigating its 
unpredictability without a com-
pass. 

By the time I had finished my 

story, an attendant had called the 
lady into the office but before she 
went in, she pointed at me from 
across the room and proudly 
claimed “You’re going to be the 
one who cures cancer.” I scoffed 
and without a beat asked “How do 
you know?” She replied, “I don’t, 
but it’s kids like you who give 
people like us hope” and walked 
into the doctor’s office. I held my 
tears in until she was out of my 
line of sight. This simple and hon-
est interaction seemed to ease the 
majority of my doubts and reaf-
firmed my passion for medicine. 
It was a moment of clarity that I 
hadn’t had all summer. 

Ironically, while preparing for 

the MCAT, I had lost sight of what 
drew me to the field in the first 
place. I had gotten too caught up 
with the anxiety and the competi-
tion of the process. My over-ambi-
tion had narrowed my perspective 
of the profession and prevented me 
from thinking about the long term. 
Becoming a doctor seemed to be 
reduced to the pre-med checklist 
that was given to me as a fresh-
man. I was focused on getting 
good grades, a good MCAT score 
and doing everything I possibly 
could to pass off as the “holistic” 
applicant. In the hopes of helping 
others, I found myself becoming 
incredibly self centered. 

However, I was missing the 

main point of it all. The can-
cer patient that approached me 
reminded me that the root of med-
icine is our service to others. It’s 
about how we treat each other. It is 
the ability to empathize with com-
plete strangers who are in their 
most vulnerable state and to reas-
sure that they would be alright. 
The patient/doctor relationship is 
based on a unique trust and faith 
that everything is being done to 
look after the patient. Having the 
perfect medical school application 
does not correlate to my ability of 
being a relatable and comforting 
human being. 

-----

It was that simple sentence that 

brought me out of my loneliness. 
As I inevitably canceled my MCAT 
date and started my next college 
semester, I began to value my rela-
tionships with people more than 
I had done before. I had friends 
who checked in on me when I was 
stressed out during the semester 
and especially around my surgery 
date. I had friends who insisted on 
hanging out with me even though 
it was inconvenient because I was 
commuting from home. I had 
friends that would carry my bag 
and walk with me to classes while 
I was on crutches. Some shared 
stories of their own injuries. I 
had professors that supported me 
and worked with me one on one 
to ensure I was staying on track. 
My family supported me uncondi-
tionally throughout the process as 
well. By the time I took the MCAT 
exam this summer, I realized I 
was not just a sum of my own hard 
work but also that of everyone 
around me. Thankfully, I was able 
to walk into the exam room on my 
own two feet.

In the hospital, a moment of clarity

A dash of spontaneity from my paati

Photo by Marcelo Leal via Unsplash

I inherited my big nose from my 

grandfather and my asthma from 
my dad. My love of dance from my 
mom and sweet tooth from my 
dad. My paati (grandma) loves 
cooking. She cooks with a sixth 
sense — heart. She makes me my 
favorite kathrikai (eggplant) each 
visit and if I were a stranger, she 
would make me kathrikai that 
tasted just the same. She is legally 
blind; she relies not on measure-
ment in her cooking but smell, 
touch, love, spice. But I don’t like 
to cook. It takes me too long and 
I need measurements. I’m not 
generous. My toast tastes differ-
ent for each relationship I have. 
Burnt, too light, rarely just right. 
I rely on pre-planned precision, 
measurement and recipes guid-
ing me through every step, but 
my paati cooks with an array of 
ingredients and spontaneity that 
speak from her heart.

ing, writing, art, learning. Your

You walk to your favorite 

rooms of the house, cleaning as 
you go. Fighting us every time we 
tell you that you should rest. 

• 
Ask if we all want chai.

Your granddaughter brings her 

oat milk for you to make your spe-
cial chai. She watches, asking you 
to teach her everything you know 
so she can be independent in col-
lege. But she knows her chai will 
never be the same. 

• 
Ask if we all want food.

• 
Take a nap.

You listen to your favorite 

prayer as you drift off, your eyes 
tired but your heart filled with 
satisfaction as you remember 
how much your babies loved your 
kathrikai.

• 
Phone call.

Your best friend from India. 

Your favorite cousin. Your daugh-
ter. You can’t wait to see them 
when you go back in the summer.

I inherited my paati’s reci-

pes; her memories occupy my 
imagination. They may not shine 
through me with physical attribu-
tions, like the bump on the bridge 
of my nose that tells of my grand-
pa’s love for travel. They may not 
be as evident as my dad’s asthma 
that plagues me in the winter. 
But I know they exist within me, 
reminding me every day that I 
must continue to protest so that I 
may create something bigger than 
myself. I’ve been blessed with a 
life that allows me to rebel explic-
itly — one that not only allows but 
challenges me to fight the sys-
tem, yet resists my strikes when 
I forget that it was my paati’s 
sacrifices and lifetime of implicit 
rebellion, biting her tongue, feed-
ing her family — that paved the 
way. So I start to make the kathri-
kai, FaceTime ringing and a mil-
lion questions on my mind that I 
know my paati will answer.

Why Writing?

Think of all the things you’ve 

ever written. Essay. Journal 
entry. TikTok comment. What 
did you write it for? To inform 
whoever reads it? To release 
your emotions? To complete 
the essay that you’ve put off all 
of Thanksgiving Break? 

There has to be some mean-

ing or reason behind every-
thing that is written because if 
there isn’t, what’s the purpose 
of it?

By now, The Michigan Daily 

has published thousands of 
articles ranging from sports 
updates to the opening of new 
dispensaries on campus, but 
what holds the most meaning, 
at least to me, is the writing 
that comes from Michigan in 
Color, “an inclusive space by 
and for people of color.” 

My experience with MiC so 

far has made me realize I enjoy 
writing for it because the writ-
ing here, to put it shortly, is 
unique. Unique in that every 
piece comes from the writers’ 
experiences and opinions as 
people of color. Unique in that 
everyone has a different reason 
for why they write.

In MiC ME Maya Mokh’s 

“Why I Joined MiC” she talks 
about how MiC gives a plat-
form for helping other POC 
have a voice and a way to share 

their stories, and she writes to 
find her voice as an Arab, Mus-
lim woman.

Or in senior Lora Faraj’s 

“Why I Joined MiC”, she says 
she writes because of instances 
in her life where subtle acts of 
Islamophobia were ignored, 
and so she hopes to explore a 
mind that has been told to stay 
quiet in those instances — her 
mind.

And in a conversation I 

had with ME Devak Nanua, I 
learned that he writes because 
he does not believe in the nar-
row perception many people 
have as to how an Asian Amer-
ican is supposed to act, so he 
writes to reinvent what being 
Indian American means to 
him. 

As these inspiring seniors 

sadly make their way to the 
end of their time in MiC, there 
is a new wave of writers who 
wish to share their experienc-
es as well.

Freshman Sarah Akaaboune 

told me that she writes because 
it gives her a sense of belong-
ing and validity, and that it 
makes her feel like she takes 
up a space that promotes good 
doings and that respects one 
another.

Freshman Grace Garmo, on 

the other hand, writes for the 
desire to learn more about her-
self through her writing and to 
connect them to her experienc-
es throughout college. Specifi-

cally, she chooses to write for 
MiC because of how much her 
cultural identity has shaped 
her as she struggled with bal-
ancing her ethnic values while 
also 
being 
surrounded 
by 

American standards. Through 
writing, she is able to stay true 

to herself and reflect on how 
she’s changing while still being 
able to hold onto these values. 

This goes to show how time-

less writing is. Issues that 
impact POC are ongoing, and 
with that, writing about the 
experiences, 
journeys 
and 

struggles are ongoing as well.

Reading what the writers of 

MiC produce is one of the best 
ways to learn about the expe-
riences and opinions of POC, 
which is important as it helps 
non-POC recognize the privi-
lege they have, which is why I 

believe the writing from Mich-
igan in Color holds so much 
meaning. 

And despite the unique rea-

sons for why MiC writers craft 
articles, in the end, every writ-
er has a common goal: to be 
heard.

MiC Columnist

I’m weary with every red-

hatted someone who walks 
past me at the grocery store. 
I’m afraid that if I take a closer 
look, I’ll be face to face with 
four words in white print, con-
firming the unease I sensed 
at first glance. I’m scared of 
every blue flag that is printed 
with those same four words, 
rippling violently through the 
wind while riding on the back 
of a red pick up truck. Make 
America Great Again. These 
four words adopted by Donald 
Trump and the injustices they 
represent have made me fear-
ful of the very colors that are 
supposed to symbolize pride 

and hope — the same colors 
that represent our nation and 
our flag. I would like to say 
that this fear is a new feeling 
that developed with the use 
of those four words. But that 
would be a lie. The way my 
stomach drops every time I see 
red and blue lights flashing in 
my rearview mirror is not a 
new feeling. I’ve been scared of 
those lights my whole life. I’ve 
always worried that they would 
be the last lights I would ever 
see. This fear has been height-
ened these past four years, but 
it is not new. This fear is rooted 
in the oppression Black people 
have suffered from since the 
foundation of this country. As 
a Black woman, I am hope-
ful that this fear will subside 
with the results of the recent 

election, but this country con-
tinuously perpetuates its sys-
temically oppressive roots so 
us marginalized people know 
better than to think anything 
will change. 

Since 
the 
anxiety-filled 

trainwreck 
that 
was 
elec-

tion week, I keep hearing how 
America needs to heal. People 
keep saying that our country is 
more divided than ever before, 
and we have a lot of work to 
do to get our country back 
to what it was four years ago 
before Trump took office. But 
why would we do that? What 
would we be going back to? 
Other than living a pandemic-
free life, there is not a moment 
in the history of this country 
that we need to revert back 
to. How can we heal a country 
that was founded on the exclu-
sion of so many people? Saying 
that we need to heal is like say-
ing we need to make America 
great again. America was never 
great, and America was never a 
safe and whole place. Anyone 

who is not a white, straight, cis 
gendered, able bodied, middle 
or upper class man has always 
suffered. 
Racism, 
sexism, 

islamophobia, transphobia and 
homophobia are just a few ide-
ologies this country embraced 
since its beginning. These ide-
ologies will continue to exist if 
we keep pretending like every-
thing was okay before 2016. 
When the fifty states are all 
mapped out and colored red 
or blue, it is easy to see how 
divided the country is. But 
the inequities marginalized 
groups of people have faced in 
America are not always nicely 
laid out on paper and easily 
defined, and just because the 
oppression is invisible to some, 
doesn’t mean it is nonexistent. 

I can agree that these last 

four years have been brutal. 
The Trump Administration has 
brought out the ugly in Ameri-
ca. But the key is “brought out”. 
Trump was only as successful 
as the people who voted for 
and supported him allowed 

for him to be. His hateful prin-
ciples are not unique; they did 
not just appear out of thin air. 
If people did not agree with 
his values, he would not have 
been able to secure the presi-
dency in the first place. Yes the 
families that were lost and sep-
arated under the U.S Immigra-
tion and Customs Enforcement 
need to be found and brought 
back together, but how will we 
get rid of the hateful ideologies 
that put them in this situa-
tion in the first place? Revert-
ing back to how things were 
before these past few years, or 
“healing” will only leave these 
hateful beliefs hidden with no 
way of knowing who possesses 
them, or when or if they will 
come out again. This leaves 
anyone the power to reinstate 
the harm we are trying to get 
rid of.

While I am scared every time 

I see Trump’s infamous “Make 
America Great Again” phrase 
on a lawn sign, I am also filled 
with rage. I am angry that 

Black people have been suffer-
ing for so long. I am exhausted 
after reading countless tweets 
defending his actions. I am 
frustrated to find out how 
so many people who I once 
trusted and called my friends 
are eager to vote against basic 
human rights, my rights. I feel 
hopeless because as I sit here 
and write this piece, and think 
about the injustices this coun-
try was built on, I’m having a 
hard time imagining what a 
semi-just society would look 
like. A country where every-
one is loved and accepted? 
That seems impossible. I do 
know that until politicians are 
able to face the truth and own 
up to the corrupt mess that is 
America, we will never grow 
to be the country marginal-
ized individuals deserve to live 
in. America needs to wake up 
to its multitude of faults and 
work to become the great place 
it has claimed to be. I am sick 
of being afraid and I am sick of 
being angry.

Opinion

K

ing George III probably 
assumed 
that 
George 

Washington 
would 
go 

the way of Oliver Cromwell. To be 
fair to America’s colonial monarch, 
it was a reasonable assumption. 
Across history, such astronomic 
victories in the field were rarely 
followed by voluntary concessions. 
Many Europeans — and even 
Americans — suspected that in 
the event of a Franco-American 
victory, Washington would retain 
his power, perhaps even becoming 
America’s king. Across the waves, 
King George III wondered the same. 
He evidently asked Benjamin West, 
a famous American painter who 
was in London at the time, what he 
thought Washington would do if the 
rebels were victorious. West said that 
he believed the Virginian planter 
would return to his estate at Mount 
Vernon — to civilian life. King George 
was stunned. “If (Washington) does 
that,” he said, “He will be the greatest 
man in the world.” 

West’s prediction was correct. 

America’s 
independence 
was 

formally confirmed through the 
Treaty of Paris in September 1783, 
and in November 1783, the last 
Redcoats in the nascent republic 
sailed out of New York Harbor. A 
month later, Washington resigned 
as 
commander-in-chief 
of 
the 

Continental Army. “Having now 
finished the work assigned me, 
I retire from the great theatre 
of Action,” Washington said in 
Annapolis, Md. “And bidding an 
Affectionate farewell (... I) take my 
leave of all the employments of public 
life.”

Of course, Washington later did 

return to public life, becoming the 
first president under the United 
States Constitution and serving 
two terms (after which, to a similar 
surprise of many, Washington again 
voluntarily gave up his power). But 
that Washington returned to public 
office after having supposedly given 
up “all the employments of public 
life” in 1783 does not dilute the 
importance or power of that moment. 
After leading the Continental forces 
through eight years of war against 

the Crown, he could have become 
an American warlord. Instead he 
became an American citizen. 

As of writing this article, Donald 

Trump is desperate. He has still 
refused to concede to Joe Biden, the 
rightful winner of the presidential 
election, which we know produced 
a fair and correct outcome. Rather 
than admit defeat with the grace 
and dignity befitting of his office 
— something all of his one-term 
predecessors have done — he has 
peddled baseless conspiracy theories 
about how the election was “rigged” 
or “stolen.” None of it is true, of 
course, which is why Trump’s half-
baked lawsuits are getting slammed 
in the courts. 

After 
four 
years 
of 
our 

commander-in-chief’s 
constant 

ridiculousness, perhaps we should be 
accustomed to this sort of behavior. 
But it is nonetheless disheartening 
to see an American president 
behave like a 4-year-old who lost a 
board game and to see millions of 
Americans support this obscene 
disrespect of our republican process. 

But 
it 
goes 
beyond 
mere 

disrespect for American democracy, 
too. Trump’s refusal to publicly 
recognize defeat, while not in itself 
a barrier to the transition of power 
— Biden will be sworn in on Jan. 20, 
2021 whether or not Trump makes a 
public concession — can cause very 
real and lasting damage to the nation. 

For one, it undermines faith in 

American democracy, both at home 
and abroad. Americans need to 
know that our electoral process is 
trustworthy and fair, and republican 
government only works because 
the losers recognize defeat. When a 
sitting American president calls that 
process a scam without evidence 
— and his base, along with scores of 
Republican Party lawmakers, abet 
these nonsense claims — it puts the 
legitimacy of our form of government 
in jeopardy. What’s more, it damages 
America’s image on the international 
stage. Americans have long regarded 
the U.S. as the paragon of democracy, 
an ideal that we have long prided 
ourselves on and often used to 
inform our foreign outlook. If we 

can’t manage a smooth transition of 
power at home, how can we expect 
the world to still see us as a model of 
democracy? 

There are also some serious 

practical consequences of Trump’s 
behavior. In rejecting Biden’s status as 
president-elect, Trump has evidently 
refused to share information about 
COVID-19 that would aid Biden’s 
transition team. Per CNN, the 
Trump 
administration 
directed 

personnel at the Department of 
Health and Human Services to not 
speak with Biden’s advisers. “Unless 
it (necessary information) is made 
available (to us) soon,” Biden said, his 
administration could “be behind by 
weeks or months” in addressing the 
pandemic.

Fortunately, 
federal 
agencies 

will cooperate with Biden’s team 
(with or without Trump’s approval) 
now that the General Services 
Administration — the agency which 
formally 
oversees 
presidential 

transition of power — has confirmed 
that Biden won the election. GSA 
Administrator 
Emily 
Murphy 

certified Biden as president-elect in 
late November, which was inevitable 
given the insubstantial nature of the 
president’s litigation.

While our sore loser-in-chief holes 

up at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. and 
pursues laughable lawsuits, rational 
Americans understand that the game 
is up. Biden is president-elect and 
Biden will become president on Jan. 
20, 2021. At that time, Trump will 
no longer be commander-in-chief; 
he will return to being just a citizen. 
Trump’s appreciation of history is 
probably as flimsy as his current 
legal proceedings, but he would be 
wise to follow the example of our 
first commander-in-chief. Perhaps in 
a few years, if he and enough of the 
American people so wish, we’ll see his 
return to the presidential arena. But 
right now, it’s time for the president 
to do what is right for America: step 
down, move aside and go home to 
Trump Tower or Mar-a-Lago or 
wherever he calls Mount Vernon.

SIERRA ÉLISE HANSEN | COLUMN
The Queen’s Gambit shows knowledge 

can’t defeat addiction

T

he period piece and limited 
Netflix series “The Queen’s 
Gambit” 
amplifies 
the 

internal contradictions of addiction 
through nostalgic portrayals of a 
time when the battle for dominance 
between the then-Soviet Union and 
the United States was predominantly 
cultural. Rife with contradictions 
in how its nostalgic renderings and 
pleasingly muted color palettes fail 
to reflect the turbulence of the late 
‘60s, the series certainly paints afresh 
a feel-good, “pull yourself up by your 
bootstraps” narrative. 

Despite this declaration making 

immediate indications of a scathing 
review, I haven’t been able to 
stop watching the show, and this 
column isn’t a review of the series 
as a whole. My tendency to notice 
one storyline embedded in the 
series over all the others is born of 
my foregrounded knowledge of 
addiction’s consequences. But the 
series offers a powerful rendition of 
how self-knowledge, or knowledge of 
the potential for hereditary diseases, 
doesn’t defeat addiction.

From the vantage point of our 

cultural moment, it is critical to 
engage the addiction narrative in 
“The Queen’s Gambit.” We could 
begin with the way the orphanage 
doses the orphans with tranquilizers 
to keep them manageable, and how 
we recently learned of McKinsey’s 
evil corporate scam, where the 
corporation knowingly preyed on 
victims of the opioid crisis by offering 
“overdose rebates” to pharmacies. 
We could begin by naming another 
example from that same legacy 
left by another quintessential icon, 
the “American scam artist,” where 
self-proclaimed 
“rehab 
centers” 

systematically scammed vulnerable, 
low-income 
families 
for 
their 

insurance money.

Even so, let us start with the 

practical and the cosmetic. About 
halfway through the series, Elizabeth 
Harmon’s addiction has clearly 
escalated — the expected trajectory 
of any active addiction from modern 
medicine’s understanding of it. It is 
additionally important that I clarify 
what I mean by this: Through the 
first half of the 20th century and 
beyond, addicts were regarded 
by Americans with characteristic 
ambivalence, perhaps epitomized 
by the United States Narco Farm 
in Lexington, Ky., which opened 
in 1935 and housed both convicted 
drug addicts and voluntary patients 
in an ultimately doomed experiment 
for treating addiction. Still, addicts 
desperate for relief even wrote letters 
to the farm’s directors begging to 
be admitted. This is despite how 
addiction was then ubiquitously 
regarded as a moral failure that could 
be cured by farm work alone. 

Today, 
addiction 
specialists 

use the term “medical model” to 
summarize their understanding as 
opposed to attributing addiction 
to moral shortcomings. But cue 

Harmon downing entire bottles of 
red wine at an astonishing pace with 
a pensive, sultry gaze. Her ensuing 
spiral into substance abuse has a 
cinematic, nearly iconic look to it. 
We might want to step away from 
imagery depicting someone’s bottom 
as a well-choreographed music video 
with only one scene of projectile 
vomiting, where she somehow never 
manages to lose the house.

She 
simultaneously 
takes 

incredibly strong tranquilizers, 
but even at the end of the series, 
anyone who has been in or has 
known someone in the throes 
of addiction cannot watch the 
final 
scene 
unfold 
without 

wondering 
how 
Taylor-Joy’s 

complexion 
has 
remained 
so 

lovely throughout. Dare I say, her 
complexion improves significantly 
and 
becomes 
miraculously 

more radiant, with not a trace of 
dehydration aside from the one 
time she downs glasses of water 
during her “hangover match” with 
the Russian. 

Even when Harry Beltik, her 

pursuer 
and 
competitor, 
notes 

changes in Harmon’s skin with no 
shortage of disgust and incredulity 
(and whoever did Taylor-Joy’s make-
up there indeed made her look quite 
a bit more pallid), I’m not sure I ever 
noticed a difference as far as her face 
appearing more bloated. If you were 
to abuse alcohol on the level Harmon 
does in “The Queen’s Gambit,” your 
face would bloat from a combination 
of water retention and weight gain. 
Alcohol has many calories and causes 
a unique kind of bloating — especially 
and very noticeably in the face. 

I have regarded my otherwise 

malnourished face in a mirror, bloated 
to the point where my own gaze didn’t 
register the years-long accumulated 
changes. Remarkably, I didn’t drink 
until my first year of college, when 
I ran cross-country for a small 
Christian school. The act of taking 
that first drink, it turns out, would 
make an incision in my life resulting in 
my nearly losing everything. You may 
believe this to be an exaggeration but, 
very unfortunately, it isn’t. 

Addiction is structural violence 

within 
the 
self 
that 
tentacles 

into obsession, like a magnetic 
field that cannot be reversed 
or deprogrammed — think the 
shimmer 
of 
Jeff 
VanderMeer’s 

“Annihilation” from which you do 
not return the same. You may not 
know this, but here is a haunting 
and predictable piece of knowledge: 
Alcohol 
effectively 
affects 
the 

hominid brain in a literalized reversal 
of its evolution. First, it powers 
down the frontal cortex, then the 
prefrontal cortex and so on. Before it 
can affect the brain stem, it silences 
the hippocampus and therefore the 
acquisition of memories. Then it 
often triggers a stupor and a restless 
sleep before it can impact involuntary 
functions such as breathing. 

Alcohol incapacitated my desire 

for everything else as if a magnet 
had steadily gained strength and 
before I knew it, the temptation had 
become physiologically built into 
my everyday. My relationship with 
alcohol was initially complicated 
because, like many people on the 
autism spectrum, I felt socializing 
was impenetrably stressful, like a 
labyrinth — every interaction was 
a calculus I was notoriously bad at. 
The first time I was legally able to 
consume a glass of wine at a formal 
event, I remember how my anxiety 
shrank to a manageable level — it felt 
like a revelation or a mere fragment 
of the carefree social life I saw others 
enjoying. I wondered why no one had 
ever told me it could feel this good, or 
this easy.

Moreover, this was before I was 

introduced to cognitive-behavioral 
techniques for disarming some of 
my more annoying tics, which did 
not make me particularly charming 
and included: repetitively sounding 
out consonants (“-th” and“-sh”), 
“stimming” 
and 
tunnel 
vision 

for particular subjects that no 
one else cared about (admittedly, 
this hasn’t gone away). Small talk 
wasn’t something I was necessarily 
“disinterested” in — it confused me. I 
tried to understand why people did it, 
and then I tried to replicate it. 

In exuding oddball glamour while 

exhibiting some of the characteristic 
obsession that I can personally 
identify with, Harmon’s character 
makes rigorous, disciplined obsession 
alongside 
fiercely 
unapologetic 

female intelligence seem a glamorous 
performance art. Even when she 
wakes up severely hungover in Paris, 
she whips her head forward and 
instantly collects herself, looking like 
a veritable siren doll with sinuously 
reflective 
red 
curls 
magically 

restored to bouncing perfection — 
just minutes after emerging from a 
bathtub with pitch-black mascara 
bleeding down her cheeks. Every 
man that has been in her life saves her 
more than once; the show is a fairy 
tale without Brothers Grimm body 
horror or any horror to speak of aside 
from its tragic opening scene.

But let’s rewind a bit more, to 

the moment when Harmon first 
visualizes an upside-down game 
of chess on the orphanage ceiling. 
There is a particularly dangerous 
form of causality being drawn here 
between 
Harmon’s 
blossoming 

intellect — her precocity — and not 
just her tendency toward addictive 
behaviors, but her addiction to 
pills as well. It’s important to note 
the difference: It’s perfectly fine to 
acknowledge that sometimes yes, 
there is a link between an individual 
who harbors some kind of genetic 
predisposition toward addiction and 
their potential for greatness.

O

n Wednesday, Nov. 25, the 
Supreme Court overturned 
New York state’s restriction 

on attendance at religious services 
amid the COVID-19 pandemic, 
claiming that New York infringed on 
freedom of religion. As a result of this 
decision, New Yorkers may now freely 
worship in large numbers, despite an 
increase in COVID-19 cases across 
the United States. This ruling may 
result in more COVID-19 cases and 
more deaths than ever before. Cold 
weather, the gatherings associated 
with the holiday season and the spike 
in attendance at religious services for 
Christmas and Hanukkah combined 
will not help. Furthermore, this 
ruling is indicative of future 
rulings of the Supreme Court. The 
majority of this Supreme Court is 
conservative and will likely rule 
accordingly in favor of exceptions 
for religious practice, as they did 
on Nov. 25. Though not surprising 
given 
the 
justices’ 
political 

views, overturning New York’s 
restriction on attending religious 
services raises New Yorkers’ risk 
of contracting the coronavirus. 
Their decision also showcases that 
this Supreme Court values religious 
freedom over the right to live. At the 
end of the day, no religious sentiments 
should be valued above the health 
of many. Life must trump religion, 
always.

Though 
religion 
should 
not 

come before human life in any 

circumstance, it can also be argued 
that New York’s restriction does not 
infringe upon the freedom of religion 
guaranteed in the Constitution. 
According to the American Civil 
Liberties Union, the First Amendment 
gives Americans the right to practice 
whatever religion they choose, or no 
religion at all. However, restricting 
in-person attendance at religious 
services does not enforce a religion, 
or lack thereof, on New Yorkers. 
Those affected by the restriction are 
still free to subscribe to any faith of 
their choosing: They simply must 
observe that faith safely, given the 
unique circumstances determined 
by the pandemic. Many historians 
also argue that First Amendment 
rights were given not to restrict 
state governments, but the federal 
government, making New York’s 
restriction constitutional through 
some lenses.

In normal times, I would agree 

with the justices in their stance that 
the government should not be able 
to determine how people choose to 
practice their respective religions. 
But we are not in normal times. The 
COVID-19 pandemic has prompted 
government intervention in many 
areas in which the government is not 
usually involved. Cities and states 
have instituted stay-at-home orders 
and mask mandates to minimize risk 
of contracting COVID-19, and these 
orders were deemed constitutional. 
Why, all of a sudden, do individual 

liberties come before national health 
when religion is involved? 

Regardless of the constitutionality 

of the restriction, we can all agree 
that it would likely mitigate the 
impacts of the pandemic in the 
holiday season. Any effective method 
of deterring people from gathering 
in large numbers will contribute 
to the national effort to slow the 
spread of COVID-19. Earlier in the 
year, religious gatherings facilitated 
community spread of COVID-19. 
Combine that inevitable spread with 
the flu season, the cold weather 
and the upcoming major religious 
holidays in the U.S., disaster is bound 
to strike. Though the Supreme Court 
has won the favor of many religious 
individuals in the U.S. with the 
ruling, its decision will likely lead to 
thousands of COVID-19 diagnoses.

Despite the Supreme Court’s 

ruling putting millions at higher risk 
of contracting COVID-19, there is 
some good news: New Yorkers, and 
all Americans, still have the agency 
to make the right decisions for 
themselves and their communities. 
Many places of worship and religious 
organizations stream services so 
attendees can practice religion from 
the safety of their own homes

I

n just under two months, 
former 
Vice 
President 

Joe Biden will assume 

the Oval Office after defeating 
incumbent President Donald 
Trump during the election 
in November. President-elect 
Biden and Vice President-elect 
Kamala Harris will seek to 
quickly make changes from 
the executive branch that will 
alter the nature of American 
leadership at home and abroad 
and create significant daylight 
between their policies and 
those put forth by Trump since 
January 2017.

One topic that has once 

again 
risen 
to 
prominence 

over the last few weeks has 
been the U.S.’s confrontational 
relationship with Iran. Amid 
uncertainty 
and 
concern 

regarding the future Biden 
administration’s 
next 
steps 

in 
managing 
the 
conflict, 

there have been indications of 
potential last-minute actions 
by the Trump administration 
that could impact the path 
forward for the president-elect. 
Reports have indicated that 
Trump consulted his military 
advisers about the possibility 
of attacking Iran’s nuclear 
processing facilities. This was 
in the wake of findings by the 
International Atomic Energy 
Agency that Iran had been 
enriching uranium on a much 
greater scale and to a greater 
degree of purity than was 
allowed for in the 2015 Iran 
Nuclear Deal.

Former 
President 
Barack 

Obama and his administration 
considered the deal, also known 
as the Joint Comprehensive 
Plan of Action, to be one of 
his 
greatest 
foreign 
policy 

achievements. Of course, that 
was 
under 
the 
assumption 

that the terms of the deal — 
which included the lifting of 
all U.S. sanctions against Iran 
in exchange for a temporary 
halt to its work on nuclear 
weapon development — were 
strong enough to bring Tehran 
closer to moderation and better 
relations with the West.

As it turned out, and as 

critics of the JCPOA had known 
for years, the so-called “deal” 
was incredibly flawed and one-
sided, and the assumptions 
by Obama and his advisers 
that led to its creation were 
fundamentally shaky, to say 
the least. The evidence found 
by the IAEA at Natanz proves 
once again that Iran has never 
had true desires to moderate 
and 
curb 
its 
aggressive 

uranium enrichment activities. 
Considering 
Iran’s 
malign 

influence 
throughout 
the 

region 
and 
the 
threat 
it 

represents to America and its 
allies, too much is at stake for 
the U.S. to simply sit back and 
hope that the terms of the 
JCPOA are honored, or that any 
true Iranian moderation would 
occur. 

To make matters worse, the 

lifting of Western sanctions 
on Iran freed up billions of 
dollars that would not be used 
for 
domestic 
improvements, 

but rather would be funneled 
into Tehran’s network of proxy 
forces that are sowing terror 
and destabilization all over the 
region. Trump made the wise 
choice to abandon the deal 
in May of 2018. While Biden 
criticized the decision and 
warned that “talk of a ‘better 
deal’ (was) an illusion,” it can 
only be said with certainty that 
the old deal wasn’t cutting it 
for the U.S. and its allies. 

While it would absolutely 

be unwise to risk a potential 
full-on armed conflict with 
Iran, the concern from Trump 
and his administration that 
the 
president-elect 
would 

repeat critical U.S. missteps 
in the Middle East is certainly 
justified. 
Biden 
has 
often 

defended 
Obama’s 
foreign 

policy record, including the 
Iran Deal and has stated 
his desires to reenter the 
agreement. 
He 
has 
also 

criticized Trump’s policies, 
which 
have 
not 
had 
any 

tangible downsides — such as 
moving the U.S. embassy in 
Israel to Jerusalem — though 

he wisely indicated he would 
not reverse the move. Biden 
himself was a signatory to 
the 1995 Jerusalem Embassy 
Act that required the U.S. 
move its embassy from Tel 
Aviv to Jerusalem. In the last 
four years, the U.S. saw its 
regional allies strengthened, 
reconciled 
and 
cooperating 

with one another in Israel 
and Gulf states such as the 
United Arab Emirates and 
Bahrain. At the same time, its 
regional adversaries like ISIS 
incurred losses in their quests 
for domination. To halt this 
course of progress would be 
very unfortunate.

In what was essentially a 

victory speech on the Friday 
after 
election 
night, 
Biden 

called for national unity and an 
end to hyperpartisanship. He 
also added that “the purpose 
of our politics … (is) to solve 
problems.” One way that the 
president-elect can stay true 
to his word is by simply not 
reversing policies or changing 
an effective strategy because 
it was implemented by the 
previous 
administration. 

Trump reversed course on 
much 
of 
the 
Obama-era 

foreign policy after significant 
evidence of its failure to bring 
positive 
developments 
and 

advance American interests; to 
have abandoned policies purely 
out of political spite would 
have been a shame. 

At the end of his term, it 

can certainly be said that for 
all his flaws in rhetoric and 
other areas of policy, Trump 
has largely been spot-on when 
it comes to the Middle East. If 
Biden truly wants to govern 
as “an American president” 
and bring an end to the rank 
partisanship that has grown 
within U.S. politics, he should 
chart a path forward that is 
based on an earnest look at 
the last few administrations’ 
successes and failures, not on 
the approval of his former boss.

The United States and polarization

LYDIA STORELLA | COLUMN

What if Al Gore had won?

ALEX NOBEL | COLUMN

On Iran and the Mideast, Biden should 

follow in Trump’s footsteps

A

s millions of Americans 
try and grapple with the 
fact that President Donald 

Trump will be a one-term president, 
it is important to note that this is not 
America’s first “disputed” election. 
In the 2000 presidential election, 
Democratic nominee former Vice 
President Al Gore and Republican 
nominee former Texas Gov. George 
W. Bush went head to head in one 
of the closest and most contested 
elections in recent American history. 
That election was much closer than 
the 2020 election and came down 
to 537 votes in Florida, where Bush’s 
younger brother, Jeb Bush, happened 
to be the governor. Due to the 
small margin, there was no winner 
declared on election night, and the 
country was forced to wait 36 days for 
the recount to be conducted. 

The 
election 
was 
eventually 

decided by the Supreme Court, which 
declared by an initial 7-2 ruling and 
then a 5-4 decision that the recount 
was unjust; in practice making 
George W. Bush the nation’s next 

commander in chief. But somewhere 
in an alternate universe, the recount 
was justified and Al Gore became the 
43rd President of the United States. 
What effect would Gore — a man 
who centered his campaign around 
environmental protection — have had 
on the planet as president?

To begin to answer this question, 

Bush’s environmental record must be 
put under a microscope. During his 
campaign, Bush promised to regulate 
carbon emissions from coal power 
plants, but like many of his campaign 
promises, he did not follow through 
with it. Just a few days into his first 
term, his administration announced 
that the United States would not enact 
the Kyoto Protocol. Signed two years 
earlier in 1998, the Kyoto Protocol 
was an international treaty, similar to 
the Paris Climate Agreement, which 
aimed to encourage countries to cut 
down on greenhouse gas emissions. 
Under Bush, the U.S. ultimately did 
not join the treaty.

A spokesman for the Sierra Club, 

Josh Dorner, explained the legacy of 

the Bush administration, saying, “The 
Bush administration has introduced 
this pervasive rot into the federal 
government which has undermined 
the rule of law, undermined science, 
undermined basic competence and 
rendered 
government 
agencies 

unable to do their most basic function 
even if they wanted to.” If that sounds 
familiar it’s because it is. 

Perhaps the most damaging 

environmental 
consequence 
of 

the Bush administration was its 
attack on science. Similar to the 
current administration, it ran a 
disinformation 
campaign 
and 

silenced scientists who spoke 
out about climate change. In 
2004, James Hansen, a NASA 
scientist, 
publicly 
accused 

the 
Bush 
administration 
of 

censoring information about the 
rate the planet was warming. 
Following the accusation, the 
White House continued to ignore 
science and tried to go around 
the 
Environmental 
Protection 

Agency to get a regulation on car 

emissions overturned by doctoring 
a scientific study. It also began 
to 
deregulate 
many 
existing 

environmental protections and put 
an emphasis on dismantling the 
Endangered Species Act — which 
included special protections for 
many animals, including polar 
bears.

So what would a President Gore 

have done differently? For starters, 
Gore would have joined the Kyoto 
Protocol, as he explained when he 
said Bush needed to “listen to those 
among his advisers who know that 
we need to have binding reductions 
in CO2.” While this would not solve 

everything, it was the absolute bare 

minimum. Additionally, Gore would 
not have rolled back environmental 
regulations in the same haphazard 
way 
as 
Bush 
did. 
Gore 
put 

environmental conservation front 
and center during his campaign and 
would have increased protections 
for water, air and wildlife. Gore 
even went so far as to say that 
environmental protection should 

become “the central organizing 
principle 
for 
civilization.” 
His 

attention toward the environment led 
almost every major environmentalist 
group to throw their support behind 
him. The Sierra Club, the U.S.’s most 
prominent 
environmental 
group, 

endorsed Gore, citing his record 
of improving air health standards, 
reducing car emissions, conserving 
America’s landscapes and decreasing 
the amount of time it took to clean up 
Superfund waste sites. 

Following 
his 
defeat, 
Gore 

focused on something bigger than 
himself. Since 2000, Gore made it 
his goal to increase awareness about 
climate change and do everything 
he can to remedy it. He has given 
thousands of presentations around 
the world about the dangers of 
inaction. In 2006, Gore released a 
documentary about climate change 
titled “An Inconvenient Truth,” 
which led to him later receiving 
a Nobel Peace Prize. That same 
year Gore started an organization 
called 
Climate 
Reality, 
which 

aimed to pressure politicians to 
support policies that protect the 
environment.

While a Gore administration 

would not have solved even close 
to every climate or environmental 
related issue, it would certainly 
have been a big improvement over 
the administration we got. A major 
difference is that climate change 
would not have been as bipartisan 
as it is now. If Gore had acted 
on climate early, it would have 
focused the debate on how best to 
solve climate change, not whether 
or not it exists. This would have 
allowed politicians to actually act 
in a timely manner and face climate 
change head-on and protecting our 
environment. A Gore presidency 
would have had a tremendous 
butterfly effect on the state of our 
present-day nation and would have 
drastically changed the situation 
we are in.

I 

am worried about the state of 
our country. Cases of COVID-
19 continue to rise daily. Our 

president and much of the Republican 
Party continue their baseless claims 
of voter fraud. These are major issues, 
but the United States is also in trouble 
if it is unable to solve the problem of 
partisanship.

In the last 40 years, Americans 

have 
become 
more 
politically 

polarized. Along with polarization 
is the rise of negative partisanship, 
the growing importance of negative 
emotions towards the other party in 
politics. Parties are increasingly held 
together by their hatred of the other 
party. 

Both parties are guilty of this: 

in 2019, 55% of Republicans called 
Democrats “immoral” while 75% 
of Democrats called Republicans 
“closed-minded.” Each of these 
percentages have increased since 
2016. The messaging of the election 
shows negative partisanship as well. 
The “Settle for Biden” movement 
demonstrates how many on the 
left put aside reservations about 
President-elect Joe Biden to vote 
President Donald Trump out of 
office. While there was no formal 
equivalent on the right, many people 
who disliked Trump voted for him, 
often citing the Democrats as their 
reason for doing so. 

This rhetoric about the other party 

is dangerous for our country. If the 
two major political parties view each 
other with suspicion and hostility, it is 
impossible to have a dialogue about 
real issues that the United States face 
and for members of our government, 
especially elected officials, to find 
policy solutions to those problems. 
Both the left and the right contribute 

to negative partisanship by acting 

in ways that lead each side to be 
dismissive of the other. Each side 
wants to be respected and have their 
views heard; negative partisanship 
prevents this from happening.

The left often resorts to calling 

Trump and his supporters racist, 

xenophobic, and uneducated to argue 
their side. This name-calling does 
nothing but serve to cause further 
separation 
between 
Democrats 

and 
Republicans. 
Why 
would 

conservatives have any reason to 
listen to what Democrats have to say 
after understanding how Democrats 
view them? People don’t like to 
be called bad names, and “racist,” 
“xenophobic” and “uneducated” are 
all clearly negative.

The left’s tendency to call Trump 

supporters “uneducated” is one of 
the most concerning ways that it 
refers to Republicans. Liberals tend 
to dismiss those without a college 
degree solely because they do not 
have that degree. This is a brand 
of liberal elitism that often goes 
unnoticed because American social 
circles tend to contain people with 
similar education levels to our own. 
But Democrats need to understand 
they are not better than Republicans 
when they have a college degree. Only 
about 35% of Americans have a four-
year degree. Democrats will not win 
voters by being patronizing; using 
talking points such as suggesting 
that most academics are Democrats, 
the most uneducated states vote red 
and saying that Republicans vote for 
policies that harm them does not do 
anything but make Republicans more 
suspicious of Democrats.

On the other hand, the right 

engages in actions that make the 
left distrustful and angry towards 
Republicans. When Senate Majority 
Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., 
nominated Justice Amy Coney 
Barrett to the Supreme Court, 
Democrats angrily pointed out the 
hypocrisy of the nomination when 
McConnell refused to allow a vote 
on Judge Merrick Garland in 2016. 
Republican citizens rejoiced while 
Democrats 
anguished. 
Senate 

Republicans went back against what 
they said in 2016 about Garland and 
the Supreme Court to support the 
nomination. 

This type of behavior from the 

left and the right is not mutually 
exclusive. They feed into each other 
and allow each side to become more 
angry, leading to deeper divisions 
between each side. The elitism of 
the left breeds anger from the right 
that leads to blatant hypocrisy. As 
long as each side sees the other as 
the enemy, we will be unable to have 
a meaningful dialogue about our 
country. The COVID-19 pandemic 
has shown how these divisions 
prevent us from not just disagreeing 
on legislation, such as a second 
stimulus package during a financial 
crisis, but having different opinions 
on facts themselves. 

The polarization of our country 

creates anger and prevents our 
government from being able to 
work together to solve problems all 
Americans face. We must work to get 
over our biases against the other side 
and realize we are all Americans, and 
while we have dramatically different 
opinions about policy, we share 
values of democracy, life and liberty. 

Whenever we catch ourselves 

making 
generalizations 
about 

any group of people, we need to 
hold ourselves accountable and 
remember 
that 
these 
thoughts 

stereotype groups of people and only 
cause further division between us. 
This is important to practice with 
marginalized communities, and it 
is important to practice with people 
with differing political views than 
our own. 

All Americans must work to 

overcome our preconceived notions 
about those we disagree with in 
order to prevent polarization from 
overtaking the country. If we follow 
the path we are on, the trends of 
disagreement over legislation as well 
as rights will continue and lead to a 
divided country whose government 
cannot work for the people and 
whose people are unable to see what 
unites us.

A

s many begin to head 
home for the holidays, it 
has become clear that this 

year will look different. If you are 
planning to safely reconnect with 
family this holiday season, there 
is bound to be tension regarding 
any discussion from a year that is 
seemingly a simulation gone rogue. 
Despite the largely-acknowledged 
principle of avoiding controversial 
talk at the Thanksgiving table, 
complicated 
conversations 
are 

essential this year more than ever 
before — especially when held with 
those you don’t agree with. 

My family and I are about as close 

as a family can be (maybe even a 
little closer than that). My parents 
are my friends, my siblings are my 
confidants and our family group 
chat — appropriately named “My 
Insane Family” — is inundated daily 
with memes, pictures of my nieces 
and occasionally something political 
or controversial. While we all share 
very similar moral values, it comes 
as a surprise to many who know 
how tight-knit my family is that our 
politics are not all aligned. While I 
won’t divulge personal information 
about any of my family members, 
I will instead use my personal 
experience as an encouragement to 
anyone heading home to a politically-
heterogeneous household. 

Before 
doing 
so, 
it 
would 

be ignorant of me to not give 

recognition 
to 
the 
divisive, 

polarizing atmosphere in which 
we live. Whether it be demanded 
recounts, a lack of concession 
from President Donald Trump or 
the vastly different opinions my 
Facebook feed has seen as a response 
to these actions, it is imperative to 
address the privilege that comes 
with accepting a difference of 
opinion. 

There are differences of opinion 

and then, in a very separate bucket, 
there are values which cannot 
be decided on personal opinion 
and instead are matters of right 
or wrong. For example, while tax 
policy is a matter of debate, the 
right for LGBTQ+ people to get 
married is a matter of values — 
equality, equity, discrimination and 
opportunity 
are 
non-negotiable. 

With 
that 
established, 
rethink 

your Thanksgiving table political 
conversation.

Admittedly, the Thanksgiving 

table is not the best place or time 
for these conversations. However, 
“nowhere” and “never” are also 
not 
sufficient 
replacements. 

Complicated conversations help us 
grow; they allow us to develop our 
own perspectives and attempt to 
see a complex issue from different 
angles. I recommend establishing 
a time and place that feels 
comfortable and open. Sometimes 
the best conversations require 

ground rules to ensure everyone 
feels like they have a safe space to 
communicate. 

At the end of the day, without 

a difference of opinion, the world 
would be mundane and resemble a 
page from a young adult dystopian 
novel. As human beings, we pride 
ourselves on our ability to produce 
and share unique thoughts. If 
we cannot find the power to 
acknowledge the other side of an 
argument, all hope in ending or 
mending the divisiveness plaguing 
every sector of life would truly be 
gone. 

There is a way to have these 

conversations and there are endless 
reasons to have them. So instead 
of banning off-color conversation, 
encourage open dialogues this 
holiday season. Find a safe space 
and be open-minded. 

It can be extremely difficult 

to look past my own ideology 
sometimes. My brother and I 
have been at a verbal duel to the 
death over issues we will never 
agree on. However, I know we 
are both better for having those 
challenging 
conversations; 
we 

exposed ourselves to another 
line of thinking and in doing so, 
garnered a better understanding of 
our own perspectives.

Normalize uncomfortable conversations this 

holiday season

t is past time for the United 
States 
to 
implement 
a 

national carbon tax. Over 40 

governments around the world have 
put in place economic mechanisms 
for 
pricing 
carbon, 
whether 

through a direct carbon tax or an 
emissions trading system. The U.S. 
is the second-largest contributor to 
carbon emissions, yet it is behind in 
the fight against climate change. A 
few individual states have enacted 
carbon taxes. But if the U.S. wants 
to remain a world leader, it needs to 
start taxing carbon at the national 
level.

The purpose of a carbon tax is 

to counteract a negative externality 
that is not already considered by the 
producer as a cost when considering 
the costs and benefits of an activity. 
While people do not intentionally 
release carbon into the atmosphere, 
it has negative side effects that 
impact all of society, such as species 
extinction, 
falling 
crop 
yields, 

intensified 
weather 
patterns, 

damage to coral reefs, rising sea 
levels and more.

Therefore, the government must 

step in and increase the price of the 
activity to make the cost accurately 
reflect the negative societal impacts. 
One of the largest sources of carbon 
emissions is fossil fuel combustion 
from burning coal, oil and natural 
gas. Humans are releasing carbon 
into the atmosphere faster than the 
natural rate. While 40 percent of 
the carbon dioxide we emit will be 

removed from the atmosphere in 
20 years, 20 percent will remain in 
the atmosphere after 1,000 years. 
Already, the parts per million 
concentration of carbon dioxide in 
the atmosphere has increased from 
about 280 ppm in 1750 to over 400 
ppm in 2019.

However, because the impacts of 

carbon emissions are not immediate, 
humans have yet to see how the 
carbon already emitted will alter the 
climate hundreds of years into the 
future. According to a 2019 report 
from the International Monetary 
Fund, an increased price on carbon 
may be the most efficient way to 
reduce global warming and air 
pollution. 

The 2015 Paris climate accord 

aims for a two-degree Celsius 
warming. However, current trends 
point to a four-degree Celsius rise 
in temperature from pre-industrial 
levels. In order to reach the two-
degree Celsius warming level, thus 
keeping the climate livable for 
humans, there must be a $75 per 
ton price by 2030. Currently, the 
global average price is $2 per ton 
of carbon emissions, and the U.S. 
has now withdrawn from the Paris 
Agreement. As a global leader, the 
U.S. must set an example for nations 
across the world and take the 
fight against climate change more 
seriously with the implementation 
of a carbon tax. 

Opponents of a carbon tax argue 

that U.S. exports would decrease 

since a carbon tax would increase 
the price of U.S. goods. However, 
consumerism would likely just be 
reallocated to carbon-free or low-
carbon goods and services that are 
cheaper than the carbon-taxed 
items. Further, some of the revenues 
from the carbon tax that do not 
get redistributed can be invested 
in renewable energy sources and 
innovation. 

Another 
possible 
risk 
of 

a carbon tax is that it could 
disproportionately 
impact 
low-

income 
individuals 
since 
the 

price of carbon-intense goods and 
services would increase equally 
across income groups. However, 
a redistribution program would 
solve this inequity by redistributing 
tax revenue to American citizens. 
Therefore, those with a smaller 
carbon footprint who pay less 
of the tax would make money 
from the revenue and be further 
incentivized to focus consumerism 
on low-carbon goods and services.

If the U.S. wants to pride itself 

on being a world leader, larger, 
concrete steps towards fighting 
climate change are necessary. 
Taxing carbon is a feasible and 
effective method for reducing 
emissions. Congress must pass 
a 
carbon 
tax 
with 
urgency, 

decreasing the harmful carbon 
emission activities in the U.S.

A

lexander 
Lukashenko, 

“Europe’s last dictator,” 
has brutally suppressed 

mass protests sparked by civil 
unrest over Belarus’s presidential 
election in August. Lukashenko, 
who has ruled Belarus with an 
iron fist since 1994, has managed 
to maintain his grip on power 
by rigging elections for more 
than two decades. No Belarusian 
presidential election since 1994 
has been declared free or fair by 
international election observers. 
With state-sponsored media, the 
Belarusian KGB and Vladimir 
Putin at his side, the Belarusian 
authoritarian has managed to 
effectively fight back against 
internal and external opposition 
to his regime for years until now.

Svetlana 
Tikhanovskaya, 
a 

former English teacher now-
turned 
Lukashenko’s 
largest 

political 
rival, 
addressed 
a 

crowd of her supporters, saying 
that she wants her “husband and 
children back” and would much 
rather “fry (her) cutlets” instead 
of leading a major opposition 
movement. 
Tikhanovskaya’s 

husband, Sergei, was the original 
contender to oppose Lukashenko 
in the August election. A popular 
YouTube blogger and activist, 
he was barred from registering 
and as a candidate and was 
thrown in prison. After her 
husband’s arrest, Tikhanovskaya 
joined forces with Veronika 
Tsepkalo, the wife of another 
barred presidential candidate, 
Valery 
Tsepkalo 
and 
Maria 

Kolesnikova, former campaign 
manager to barred candidate 
Viktar 
Babaryka. 
Together, 

this powerful female trio has 
managed to ignite one of the most 
expansive protest movements 
against 
Lukashenko’s 
brutal 

regime.

Lukashenko’s 
misogyny 

was on full display during his 
campaign, saying that a female 

president like Tikhanovskaya 
“would collapse, poor thing.” 
Beyond his routine targeting 
of 
female 
pro-democracy 

activists, the Belarusian KGB 
went into overdrive to persecute 
anyone perceived as a political 
opponent leading up to the 
election, including journalists, 
monitors and foreign citizens. 
Lukashenko’s 
focus 
on 

eliminating his opposition has 
gone far beyond his attention to 
COVID-19, which he’s dismissed 
as “psychosis.” In accordance 
with 
his 
typical 
machismo, 

Lukashenko 
suggested 
that 

drinking vodka, riding tractors 
through fields and going to 
the sauna would be enough to 
counteract the deadly virus that 
has claimed over a million lives 
worldwide.

Despite 
losing 
the 
rigged 

election, and being forced to flee 
the country, Tikhanovskaya’s 
group of three has managed to 
continue to fuel the mass protests 
for 
democracy 
and 
human 

rights. Following the elections, 
multiple state TV personalities, 
bastions for the preservation 
of Lukashenko’s rule, resigned 
and joined the anti-government 
protests. Students, doctors, the 
elderly and prominent athletes 
and actors have joined since the 
popular movement’s start more 
than 100 days ago.

Diana Pchelinkova, a young 

female 
activist 
from 
Minsk 

described 
the 
brutality 
she 

endured during pro-democracy 
protests to the BBC. As she fled 
from the police, she and other 
protesters ran into an apartment 
building, seeking shelter in an 
apartment: “I was the last one. 
I fell at the entrance. They hit 
my back with batons. We tried 
to shut the door but they pushed 
through.” 

According to her account, 

officers 
stormed 
in 
the 

apartment 
Pchelinkova 
had 

taken shelter in and began 
beating 
the 
male 
protesters 

while the women screamed and 
begged for the police to spare 
them from detention. 

Another 
female 
activist, 

Alesya, who frequently attends 
anti-government 
rallies, 

recounted her experience at 
a protest in early November. 
As 
crowds 
increased, 
stun 

grenades were unleashed on the 
peaceful protesters and police 
hit people with batons. “They 
attacked us again and again. 
It was awful. They ferociously 
beat people, twisted their arms 
and 
took 
us 
away,” 
Alesya 

said. Female leadership and 
widespread female participation 
in the protests aimed at ousting 
Lukashenko 
are 
not 
only 

eroding the old-guard Soviet-
style 
institutions 
that 
have 

kept Lukashenko in power for 
decades but also the image of 
the traditionally ultra-macho 
authoritarian leader.

Tikhanovskaya’s 
rise 
along 

with Tsepkalo and Kolesnikova’s 
feminist leadership has effectively 
destroyed one of Europe’s last 
strongmen, 
as 
Lukashenko 

continues to frantically suppress 
his opposition and likely fears 
retribution 
from 
Vladimir 

Putin in a similar style to 
Russia’s illegal annexation of 
Crimea in 2014. Three women 
have brought one strong man 
down to his knees, and if they 
succeed, 
Tikhanovskaya, 
the 

Belarussian “Joan of Arc,” will 
radically change the landscape 
of the Soviet-style nation, despite 
having to tackle undoubtedly 
difficult challenges for a former 
teacher and housewife, including 
rampant 
corruption, 
extreme 

poverty and COVID-19.

A remote freshman’s semester in review

I 

may be a little late on the 
Thanksgiving 
vibes 
but, 

as a whole, the holiday 

season offers time to “give 
thanks” (something we should 
do at least once every day). As 
the semester winds to a close 
and Michiganders prepare for 
another winter featuring hell’s 
elemental wrath, I would be 
remiss if I did not stop to think 
about these last three months. 

Back in the summer, my 

excitement was overwhelming. 
My senior year of high school had 
ended abruptly and I was ready 
for a fresh start. I agonized over 
my classes in July and signed 
up for move-in in August, both 
with an enthusiasm unknown 
to mankind. I figured it was 
only a matter of time before my 
“college experience” began.

As it turns out, expectations 

rarely meet reality. I elected 
to study remotely as all my 

classes were online. I refused 

to cancel my housing contract 
with the hope of returning 
once the number of COVID-
19 cases lowered, a moment 
that never came. My parents 
are 
immunocompromised, 
so 

my options are limited in my 
hometown as well. It’s been 
nearly impossible to salvage the 
positives.

However, I’m not looking for 

pity. Coupled with the University 
of Michigan’s recent housing 
decision, it’s been a tumultuous 
experience for many first-year 

students, even those that are 

on-campus. 
Without 
further 

ado, here are the highs and lows 
from 164 miles away.

The good: The option for 

students to attend hybrid classes 
was inspiring. Although 77% of all 
credit hours were taken remotely, 
some students were allowed to 
enjoy face-to-face socialization, a 
scarcity nowadays but refreshing 

when available. Here’s to hoping 
— out of all our pandemic-related 
collegiate issues — for more 
opportunities 
for 
in-person 

education and interaction in 2021.

Our clubs and organizations 

have been extremely diligent. 
The rush processes for most 
Fraternity & Sorority life and 
professional 
fraternities 
have 

so far been virtual and well-
executed. I am a member of the 
Sports 
Business 
Association 

and we have a speaker series 
every week over Zoom, as well 
as 
professional 
development 

workshops. 
From 
what 
I’ve 

heard from other students, their 
extracurricular activities have 
been conducted in a similar 
fashion. Keep up the awesome 
work, guys.

The bad: The awkwardness in 

Zoom’s “breakout room” feature 
is almost palpable. Unless you 
have a Chatty Kathy in your 
group, chances are the first 
minutes will be spent blankly 
staring at each other in silence. 
Then, when you finally are able 
to converse, the professor is 
already calling you back and you 
have to strategically say goodbye. 
Alternatively, there’s a chance 
your group hits it off! Sadly, 
you’re probably not talking about 
what you were assigned, so that’s 
no good either.

Why the heck were community 

bathrooms 
an 
option 
this 

semester? No less one that came 
to fruition! No one is going to 
reasonably wear a mask while 
showering or brushing their 
teeth and, if Michigan Housing 
thought otherwise, they were 
so 
devastatingly 
wrong. 
I’m 

not suggesting that we go full-
out barbaric and conduct our 
business among nature, but can’t 
we push a little more for a safer 
substitute during this time?

Football season, on the whole, 

has been operating below its 
usual standards. The Holy Grail 
of fall Saturdays currently does 
not exist. Where else would 
you rather be on an Ann Arbor 
weekend than among 110,000 
screaming fans? I get it, this 
pandemic has stripped us of far 
too much, but it still hurts to 
watch the empty, cardboard-
filled 
stands 
at 
Michigan 

Stadium. Plus, if that wasn’t bad 
enough, our annoying neighbors 
to the south were victorious and 
Jim Harbaugh appears lost yet 
again. His team is a measly 2-4, 
underperforming by the most 
mediocre of expectations. He 
might want to start looking for a 
realtor soon. 

A week ago I returned to Ann 

Arbor to move the few belongings 
I had in Mary Markley Residence 
Hall back to my house. It was 
strange coming back. I’ve been 
to campus plenty of times for a 
variety of reasons. Yet somehow, 
on what should have been a typical 
fall afternoon, the place I’d come 
to love had never felt more foreign. 

Then again, this semester — as 

we’ve all learned — has become 
entirely 
atypical. 
On-campus 

freshmen may have had some fun, 
but they’d be cheating themselves 
by believing they received the 
full experience. The University 
is too diverse and enriching in 
its possibilities for this year’s 
freshmen to be satisfied in the 
short and limited time they’ve 
spent here.

For first-years who have spent 

the year at home, it’s okay to admit 
our “experience” was unflattering. 
Make no mistake, it’s felt like high 
school 2.0. We’ll enter next fall 
feeling like freshmen, feeling a 
year behind our classmates and 
a lifetime behind our older peers.

statement

P

eople love listening to other peo-
ple talk about sex.

The fear is actually talking 

about it themselves. Aside from the awkward 
sit-down discussions some parents force 
upon their adolescent children and the inad-
equate sex education classes most students 
are subjected to, talking about sex is gener-
ally considered taboo — most especially for 
women.

Most men are granted a free pass in this 

department. As I’m sure you’ve heard as 
many times as I have, boys will be boys. Our 
society frames men as more dominant, ag-
gressive, sexual and outright horny in their 
nature, so who can blame them when they 
want to talk about how good a partner is in 
bed, or how badly they’d love to sleep with 
someone? And when the current United 
States president has said, on record, to, “grab 
‘em (women) by the pussy,” it makes sense 
that no one bats an eye when the sex talk is 
male-dominated — no matter the content or 
harm it implies. 

This isn’t the case for women, or for 

anyone who isn’t a cisgender, heterosexual 
male for that matter. The narrative around 
sex has historically been that it’s a private 
act people engage in for the purpose of 
two goals: 1) To reproduce and 2) To please 
men. And if women are going to talk about 
it, it better be about at least one of those two 
things. The distinction here comes from 
where and when it is discussed: If it’s about 
having a child, it’s permissible to discuss 
in public; If it’s about pleasing a man, well 
… that’s a conversation for behind closed 
doors. Anything not adhering to these in-
visible yet unspoken rules is deemed by po-
lite society as dirty and impure. 

It should be at least somewhat obvious 

that everything I just mentioned is objec-
tively backward in tradition and oppres-
sive. All people, regardless of their identi-
ties, should be able to talk about all of the 
intricacies of sex. Whether it be shifting 
the dialogue around pleasure, or making 
people feel less alone in discussing what 
often are universal experiences, we must 
break the barriers around these conver-
sations. But what’s the best way to do so? 

The answer may lie in the media. 
Media inevitably shapes public opin-

ion, as it proves to have a strong influ-
ence on who and what is normalized. For 
years now, different types of media have 
worked to make discussing women and 
sexuality more acceptable. Breakthroughs 
began with the emergence of sex-positive 
feminists in the 1960s and ‘70s, with a fo-
cus on deconstructing the stigma around 
sexuality to improve intimate relationships 
overall. From then, the media improved 
with developments like the pioneering ca-
reer of sex therapist Dr. Ruth Westheimer, 
the 1960s shift in Cosmopolitan’s focus to 
sex initiated by Helen Gurley Brown or 
the 1998 premiere of “Sex and the City.” 
With these markers, sex-based conversa-
tion among women has made significant 
strides. These changes have helped women 
across the country feel a sense of reassur-
ance and empowerment in their sexuality, 
undoubtedly marking some degree of prog-
ress. Though these programs started off as 
progressive for their time period, modern 
culture has inevitably changed — and with 
it comes a change in demand for pushing 
boundaries. 

Introducing: “Call Her Daddy,” a new and 

popular female-led, sex-focused podcast, 
which has turned what’s considered permis-
sible for sex and media right on its head.

The show doesn’t talk about sex in a way 

that lacks depth; instead, “Call Her Daddy” 
immediately dives into all of the dirty de-
tails of explicit sex techniques and common 
mishaps. In an attempt to be relatable and 

authentic, the podcast spits in the face of ex-
pected pleasantries: It’s unfiltered, explicit 
and extremely raunchy. They swear — they 
refer to sex as fucking; genitalia as dicks, 
pussies, tits and ass and common sexual acts 
like oral as blowjobs and eating out. And lis-
teners seemed to like it — in 2018, the show 
hit two million downloads just two months 
after its creation.

When I first heard about Call Her Daddy, 

I was overwhelmed with excitement. As a 
sex-positive feminist, I’ve recognized the 
importance of and called for this type of nu-
anced sex media since I began studying gen-
der and sexuality. A podcast with this much 
success felt groundbreaking and promising. I 
was sure that this was a step of progress that 
society so desperately needed. Yet after ac-
tively listening for a handful of months, my 
honeymoon phase began to deteriorate and a 
wave of clarity forced me to take a step back.

The closer I paid attention to Call Her 

Daddy’s content, the more I realized that it 
was full of issues. The show preached em-

powerment, agency and autonomy, yet had 
misogynistic undertones with arguably prob-
lematic messages. Not to mention, at the time 
the show was hosted by two conventionally 
attractive, heterosexual, young white women 
— a standard that is by no means the norm 
and comes with a set of undeniable privileg-
es. With this in mind, I began to question: 

Who does this podcast really serve, and 

how is it shifting the public discourse around 
sex?
A Crash Course on Call Her Daddy

In the fall of 2018, roommates Alexan-

dra (Alex) Cooper, 24, and Sofia Franklyn, 
26, were living and working in New York 
City. At the time, both women were unen-
thusiastic about their day jobs, so when 
they gained positive attention for “talking 
candidly about sex” from strangers in an 
Austin bar, they seized what they saw as 
an exciting opportunity. They took their 
casual, off-the-record conversations to the 
internet, creating the infamous “Call Her 
Daddy” podcast.

And with this setup, the “Call Her Dad-

dy” brand was born: a name that purposely 
attempts to take back the power from men 
by attributing a patriarchal position of 
power to women. The duo began releasing 
half-hour episodes with eye-catching titles 
such as “SEXT ME SO I KNOW IT’S REAL” 
and “Fine Dining: An Eating Out Special.” 

Each episode was structured as a conversa-
tion between Alex and Sofia, touching on 
elements like stories from their pasts, out-
of-the-box sexual theories like the concept 
of “post nut clarity” and advice on how to 
have better sex. They were young, carefree, 
funny and unapologetically detailed as they 
discussed the intricacies of their sex lives. 

Following its release, “Call Her Daddy” 

gained thousands of listeners and climbed the 
charts of Apple podcasts. It was evident that 
their first listeners experienced “Call Her 
Daddy” as a breath of fresh air, transform-
ing the show into an overnight sensation. For 
many, the podcast represented a sort of fly-
on-the-wall look into how young women re-
ally talk about sex with their friends. People 
started to take notice of this success and af-
ter only a month of content, Barstool Sports, 
a well-known, polarizing digital media com-
pany, acquired the rights to the show.

It’s important to note that Barstool 

Sports, led by University of Michigan alum 
Dave Portnoy, is an extremely controversial 

company. What began as a sports newspa-
per grew into an empire, with content rang-
ing from food to pop culture. Barstool has 
a target audience of men aged 18 to 34, so 
much of its material is catered to male col-
lege students. This premise is not problem-
atic in its nature but is misogynistic in its 
execution. They have affiliate accounts like 
Barstool Smokeshows — an Instagram dedi-
cated to showing off “hot” young women in 
an extremely objectifying manner. They told 
a female staffer that she will not “be able to 
put her face in front of a camera in five years, 
because people will throw up,” and publicly 
said ESPN sportscaster Sam Ponder’s main 
job requirement is “to make men hard,” 
among other disturbing instances. With this 
in mind, I found it peculiar that a corpora-
tion so evidently tainted by toxic masculinity 
would be interested in purchasing a podcast 
that claims to empower women.

Nevertheless, the Barstool acquisition 

pushed “Call Her Daddy’s ratings over the 
edge, catalyzing the creation of a loyal fan-
base known as the “Daddy Gang.” And even 
after drama between the two hosts and Bar-
stool itself — Cooper is now the sole host due 
to a widely publicized dispute with Franklyn 
— the show still has millions of listeners, its 
Instagram has 1.8 million followers and the 
brand has numerous items of merchandise. 
It’s safe to say that “Call Her Daddy” is no 

longer just a podcast but also a community. 
Testimonies from the “Daddy Gang”

To further understand the intricacies and 

implications of the mass consumption of 
“Call Her Daddy,” I interviewed fans of the 
show to see why they like it so much. Their 
answers were wide-ranging and passionate, 
illustrating a deep care for the subject mat-
ter. 

I first spoke to LSA sophomore Jordyn 

Staff over Zoom, who reflected on her ex-
periences with the podcast. Enthusiastic 
and well-spoken, she told me that she was 
introduced to “Call Her Daddy” her fresh-
man year by her male friends and has been 
hooked ever since. 

“After I started, I began listening almost 

every day, and I fell in love with it,” Staff said. 
“I’ve listened to every single episode.” 

What excited her about the podcast, Staff 

said, was how real and unfettered it was.

“What initially hooked me was the show’s 

rawness,” Staff said. “You’re listening to the 
craziest of conversations that sound like the 
ones you have with your friends, and it’s just 
validating … All girls have these conversa-
tions but nobody ever talks about it because 
women are not supposed to be sexually out 
there.”

This sentiment mirrored my frustration 

with the lack of authentic sex-based discus-
sion among women in the public sphere. 

“There’s a standard that men know what 

women want more than women know what 
women want,” Staff said.“‘Call Her Daddy’ is 
working toward balancing the playing field 
… It’s a form of empowerment, and it’s a 
form of education that has been stripped by 
people trying to censor fluidity and freedom 
of expression. And they introduced the new 
medium of empowerment, focused on wom-
en pleasing themselves, or doing things for 
themselves that is so ignored by any other 
media platform.”

LSA junior Daniel Glickman offered a 

similar analysis, especially focusing on the 
podcast’s current-day relevance. 

“For what it is, the podcast gets into a 

space that not many others do. ‘Call Her 
Daddy’ illustrates a new age,” he explained. 
“For example, Samantha from ‘Sex and The 
City’ is so open about sexuality, but Alex re-
cently graduated from BU and is telling sto-
ries from college or reading her Instagram 
DMs. That sort of thing is just more modern. 
It’s a new exploration of sex relatable to a 
younger crowd.”

Glickman is a recent initiate into the Dad-

dy Gang, having started the podcast over the 
summer. For him, the show’s biggest selling 
point is its fearlessness in describing sex and 
sexuality. 

“For me, I’m kind of shy when it comes 

to talking about that stuff, and it shows that 
people can be candid and talk about their ex-
periences, so I like that it exists,” Glickman 
said.

Glickman and I spent a good amount of 

our interview discussing how the normaliza-
tion of sex-based conversation can be reas-
suring for many people. “Call Her Daddy” 
makes an overt effort to do this while still 
engaging viewers, accepting questions from 
their audience in a way that preserves the 
asker’s anonymity. In doing so, the podcast 
not only creates but reinforces a sense of 
community. 

“When they read direct messages from 

people, it allows audience members to step 
back and realize ‘OK, that experience was 
something similar to what I’ve had, but I 
didn’t acknowledge it, or I didn’t see that 
there could be a similarity between me and 
someone else,’” Glickman said.

C

an anyone else, like, not stop jerk-
ing off?”

Our respective Zoom boxes lit 

up in a staggered glow as my group of friends 
and I erupted into laughter. It was April, 
and we were enduring what would be the 
second month of a long, monotonous, 2020 
thing called quarantine. That one endearing 
question had elicited possibly the first pang 
of hysterical joy I had experienced in weeks.

My friend’s inquiry was met with the muf-

fled commentary of an agreeing crowd:

“Yeah, oh my god, I thought it was just 

me.”

“I can’t stop!”
“Yeah, what the hell, I’m doing it so much 

more often than usual.”

It turns out she wasn’t alone. 
In the months following that Zoom call, I 

continued to notice, on various forms of both 
traditional and social media, an enduring 
theme of solo sex as the favored quarantine 
activity; the premier pandemic antidote. 

Despite the arguably designated stages 

of quarantine trends, from whipped-coffee 
recipes and “Tiger King” marathons to the 
slew of controversial transitions to in-person 
schooling and University-outbreak-hysteria, 
one quarantine trend has carried consistent 
cultural relevance amid masks and mara-
thons, vacation-shaming and TikTok-mak-
ing: the “m” word.

Yes, masturbation.
I was unsurprised to find that most people 

I talked to about masturbation as the quaran-
tine pastime met me with blushed faces. The 
act carries a significant, religiously-bound 
history of stigmatization. 

In a 2020 study by Planned Parenthood, 

researchers discussed how masturbation 
as a means of self-pleasure actually carries 
historical controversy: It was once associ-
ated with “pathological origins and negative 
physical and mental health consequences,” 
including a so-called “post-masturbation 
disease” popularized by 18th-century medi-
cal practitioners. In his 1711 editions of the 
Treatise of Venereal Diseases, medical en-
trepreneur John Marten identified some 
of the symptoms of the “uncleanly” condi-
tion, which included “meager jaws and pale 
looks” and “legs without calves.”

The taboo nature of the act also carries 

a significant religious basis, specifically 
with ties to early Christian teachings. Even 
though the Bible makes no explicit refer-
ences to masturbation, the act was heav-
ily condemned by fathers of the early 
church, who considered it sinful due 
to its non-procreative nature. 

But, by the grace of some brave 

friends and an anonymous Google 
form, I was able to break through 
this sturdy, historically-con-
structed stigma against solo 
sex and hear about their expe-
riences with mid-pandemic 
masturbation. 

My friends’ Google Form 

responses seemed to echo 
what I had initially heard in 
that mid-April-Zoom-call:

Friend 1: I was so bored 

in March that I masturbated 
mindlessly all hours of the 
day. I didn’t need a reason. It 
was literally mind-numbing.

Friend 2: (During quar-

antine, I masturbated) so so 
much!!! Like I was just bored and 
horny ALL THE TIME.

Friend 3: I definitely did it way 

more out of boredom, like, I had nothing else 
to do.

Through the Statement’s annual sex sur-

vey, I was able to quantify the wave of mid-
pandemic masturbation sentiment I was 
gathering from friends. It seems as though 
we really are all making use of our hands 
while spending more time at home. 

The survey, which was sent to over 48,000 

undergraduate and graduate students at the 
University of Michigan and received over 
3,700 responses, included various questions 
on the frequency and motivations behind 
masturbation. 

Under the question, “On average, how 

often have you masturbated this semester,” 
students did, in fact, demonstrate increased 
rates of masturbation during these pandem-
ic-stricken months, when compared to sur-
vey data from the Fall 2018 Semester, which 
had around 1,700 responses. 

The number of women who masturbated 

five to six times per week nearly doubled, 
from 2.7% in 2018 to 4.4% in 2020; for wom-
en who masturbated once or twice per week 
the rates increased from 22.3% in 2018 to 
29.7% in 2020. The masturbation rates for 
men also increased in a similar manner as 
those for women.

When it came down to the reasons why 

people masturbate, 56.5% indicated “for 
pleasure,” 49.3% said for stress-relief and 
there was significant mention of boredom 
as a reason in the free-response section. 
Similarly, in the free-response section for the 
question, “How has the COVID-19 pandemic 
affected your sexual activity?” multiple peo-
ple mentioned increased masturbation as an 
effect. 

It doesn’t take an expert to deduce how 

this wave of self-pleasure during the pan-
demic came to be. The equation looks like 
this: More time at home + stressful circum-
stances + possibly less time spent with sexual 
partners = we make do with what we can do 
for ourselves, with something that’s proven 
to have multiple mental and physical health 
benefits.

Megan Fleming, a clinical 

psychologist at Cor-
nell University 
specializ-
ing in 

sex and relationships, offers a more sophis-
ticated explanation when she said, during 
times like these, “all of our nervous systems 
are on high alert for danger.”

“The good news is that masturbation 

can act as a reset button,” she said. “It tells 
your brain that things are OK, that you can 
breathe and relax.”

Masturbation holds the same position in 

public discourse that it has occupied for a 
while; it’s something we do behind closed 
doors, nothing more than a stress-reliever 
and, thus, a favorable way to pass time in 
quarantine. 

However, at the end of March, a public 

health guide issued by the New York City 
Health Department seemed to motivate 
a considerable shift in the ways we think 
about, discuss and culturally approach mas-
turbation. The department’s guide read: 
“Have sex only with people close to you. You 
are your safest sex partner. Masturbation 
will not spread COVID-19.”

No longer an idea met with blushed faces, 

the “m-word” was now formally delineated 
and even encouraged via a government-is-
sued advisory document. 

And suddenly, something once so severely 

stigmatized was catapulted into the public 
narrative. Major news sources like The New 
York Times, the Los Angeles Times and the 
Chicago Tribunewere not only reporting on 
the benefits of mid-pandemic solo sex but 
were also highlighting the booming sale of 
sex toys and increased pornography viewer-
ship that they attributed to increased rates of 
self-pleasure.

In the weeks following the New York City 

Health Department’s “Safer Sex and COV-
ID-19” guide, the Chicago Tribune published 
a piece in direct response titled, “‘Masturba-
tion will not spread COVID-19’: Solo sex is 
best option for pleasure during quarantine, 
especially if you live alone.” 

In the piece, they declared that quaran-

tine “doesn’t mean sexual pleasure is over — 
it just looks different, like engaging in more 
masturbation.”

The article went on to quote a Los 

Angeles Times report stat-

ing that there has 

been a 30% to 

100% in-

crease 

i
n 

sex toy sales since the onset of the pandemic. 
The consumers had spoken: We’re mastur-
bating more!

The New York Times joined this conversa-

tion in the following weeks with their piece 
“Sellers of Sex Toys Capitalized on All That 
Alone Time,” which highlighted the massive 
spike in sales sex toy companies were see-
ing. Among the more notable trends include 
the 200% increase in sales both We-Vibe and 
Womanizer were seen since April 2019.

All the while, Pornhub, the world’s lead-

ing free pornography site, cashed in on this 
quarantine masturbation craze with its 
launch of #StayHomeHub in March. Italian 
citizens were their initial audience as Italy 
was the first European nation to be affected 
by the virus.

A media study distributed by the U.S. 

National Library of Medicine noted Porn-
hub’s tactful offer, stating that the plat-
form, “... made headlines worldwide … 
because it gave quarantined Italians free 
premium access to the platform for one 
month. The offer was so positively re-
ceived that Pornhub immediately expand-
ed it to Spain and France and eventually 
the whole world.”

At the end of March, Pornhub nar-

rowed in on the same “You are your safest 
sex partner” narrative the New York City 
Health Department first introduced to us. 

The platform tweeted: “Stay home and 

help flatten the curve! Since COVID-19 
continues to impact us all, Pornhub has 
decided to extend Free Pornhub Premium 
worldwide until April 23rd. So enjoy, stay 
home, and stay safe … #StayHomehub.”

Over the course of a few weeks, sex toy 

sales, porn viewership and Pornhub ratings 
in particular shifted from symptoms of “sin-
ful practice” that we previously refused to 
acknowledge on mainstream platforms to 
favorable, commercialized prevention meth-
ods against COVID-19. Now, we’re not just 
masturbating behind closed doors, we’re 
masturbating and flattening the curve behind 
closed doors.

So, what kind of effect might this shift have 

on the public discourse surrounding mastur-
bation? In a post-COVID world, will news 
outlets continue to report on and distribute 
information surrounding the ways we’re 
pleasuring ourselves? Will the destigmatiza-
tion of masturbation prove to be an enduring 
cultural byproduct of the pandemic? 

Laurie Mintz, a psychologist and Univer-

sity of Florida professor, expressed in the 

same Los Angeles Times report that, yes, 

change is coming:

“People are scared,” Mintz said. 

“People are lonely, and I think there’s 
been enough talk [about the topic 
that] it’s destigmatizing sex toys 
and masturbation — finally — and 
that could be one of the very few 
positive outcomes of all this.”

In a phone interview with 

The Daily, Hollis Griffin, an as-
sociate professor in the LSA 
department of communication 
and media, felt more unsure 
about any prospective change. 

“I think it’s hard to say what 

kind of effect (increased news 
media coverage of masturbation) 
will have,” he said.

I

t’s that time of year again, Michigan 
Daily readers. The leaves are chang-
ing, holiday music is playing, snow is 

falling and you guessed it — The Statement 
Magazine is analyzing campus sex culture. 
Welcome to our annual sex edition, where 
we dive deep into the topic’s nuances and in-
tricacies through narratives and investigative 
pieces. But first, in order to get quantitative 
data about what sex looks like for students 
at the University of Michigan, we created a 
survey with a wide-range of questions fo-
cused on sexual education, perceptions and 
activity. Our survey was sent to all University 
of Michigan students, undergraduate and 
graduate students alike, totaling 47,902 re-
cipients. 

Of those recipients, 3,761 people re-

sponded, consisting of a makeup of 17.1% 
freshman, 15% sophomores, 17% juniors, 
18.3% seniors and a significant 32.6% gradu-
ate students. In regards to gender identity, 
57.3% of respondents identified as female, 
40.9% as male and 1.8% as non-binary. The 
respondents described sexual orientation 
was also 72.1% heterosexual, 13.9% bisex-
ual, 5.8% lesbian/gay and 8.2% as other. 
It should be noted the statistics resulting 
from this survey may be skewed, as many 
individuals may not have wished to disclose 
information detailed in the questionnaire, 
may have refrained from answering certain 
questions and/or may have answered ques-
tions dishonestly.

While most students, across gender iden-

tities, seem to have conversations about con-
traception and who is responsible for it, more 
women are expected to take or use contra-
ception compared to men. Men were more 
likely to answer that it is unclear who takes 
contraception or that their partner does. We 
recognize the limitations of this question, as 
not all people are in relationships that re-
quire contraceptive care.

Many responses concerning one’s pre-

ferred post-coital activity mentioned cud-
dling, “chilling” and napping. This was sur-
prising given how college-hook up culture is 
often associated with a “hit-it-and-quit-it” 
mentality, which can normalize a sense of 
detachment from your sexual partner after 
sex, making it like a business transaction. 
Cuddling after sex, however, is a bonding ac-
tivity that strengthens relationships. It is im-
portant to note that the majority of respon-
dents indicated that they are in an exclusive 
relationship, so perhaps this is a correlation.

Two main themes that arose in response 

to the free-response question “What do you 
wish you had learned about sex when you 
were younger?” was 1) more information 
on same-sex sex and 2) more information 
on consent. Other responses detailed how 
the internet served as an educational tool to 
learn about other forms of sex besides het-
erosexual sex; additionally, responses that 
were common were learning what a healthy 
relationship is, how to communicate your 
sexual needs and the general normalization 
of sex.

In response to the question of generally, 

what reasons do survey-takers mastrubate, 

respondents were able to write in their own 
free response answers, aside from the check-
box options of “for pleasure,” “stress-relief,” 
“to find out what you like” and to “boost 
self-esteem.” The most common write-in 
answers for why one would masturbate in-
cluded out of boredom, to help them fall 
asleep, to procrastinate or to achieve clarity 
of mind and focus. We found the frequency 
of these responses to be notable, indicating 
commonalities behind certain motivations to 
masturbate that we may have not considered 
obvious before, like clarity and sleep aid. 

An overwhelming amount of people who 

answered the free-response question “If you 
answered that your sexual experiences in 
college have been mostly negative, why?” in-
dicated that they have experienced sexual as-
sault and/or sexual harassment during their 
time in college. Another glaring theme in 
these responses include a lack of communi-
cation. Those parties involved had interests 
that didn’t align with each other romanti-
cally, or did not know how to say what felt 
good during sex, which was especially distin-
guished by gender — many responses noted 
that men aren’t aware on how to provide fe-
male pleasure.

This figure did not surprise us, as fresh-

men have had less time than upperclassmen 
to have multiple sexual experiences. Espe-
cially in the time of COVID-19, when en-
forced social distancing and quarantine have 
made sexual encounters limited, it would 
make sense for numbers of sexual partners 
to remain low.

T

he survey posed two questions to 
gauge how students’ perceptions 
of their peers’ sexual behavior dif-

fered from reality. Indeed, our findings show 
that while the majority of students think 
that students on campus are having sex once 
or twice a week or less, the reality involves 
less frequent sex. Of the respondents, 39.8% 
indicated not having sex at all this semes-
ter, while 25.1% indicated once or twice per 
month or less and 23.6% said once or twice 
per week. 

Overall, for the 2020 fall semester, 60.2% 

of respondents indicated that they’ve had sex 
this semester. This is down by 5% from The 
Statement’s 2018 Sex Survey. While there is 
no exact way to know why this is, we pre-

sume that the COVID-19 pandemic has made 
it more difficult — and thus less likely — for 
students to engage in sex frequently. This is 
supported by the free response answers to 
the question, “How has the COVID-19 pan-
demic affected your sexual activity?” where-
in there were many responses indicating less 
sex due to stress from the pandemic, safety 
protocols or less opportunities to meet sex-
ual partners.

In conclusion, this year’s sex survey was 

especially interesting given the unique con-
text of our times. We’re curious to see how 
trends will change when the data is com-
pared to next year’s survey, given the hopes 
that the circumstances regarding pandemic 
will have improved. Until then, folks.

The most popular response we received 

for why our respondents have sex is for 
pleasure, with 59.7% of people selecting this 
option. Other popular responses included 
40.1% of respondents saying they have sex 
out of love, and 24% answering that they 
have sex to feel wanted. What we found no-
table here was the 8.8% of people who an-
swered that they have sex because they feel 
it is expected in a relationship. It should also 
be taken into consideration that this question 
was offered in a “check all that apply format,” 
meaning that it is likely certain options have 
significant overlap with one another.

What most struck us about this data was 

the disparity between women and men, as 
well as women and non-binary people, in 
how often they masturbate. Women seem to 
masturbate less than both men and non-bina-
ry, with the majority of women masturbating 
once or twice per week or less. The major-
ity of men and non-binary people masturbate 
once or twice per week or more.

Here we see that while women are more 

likely to answer “agree” to enjoying having

category. We’re not sure if or what exactly 
this indicates, considering the subjective 
scale (i.e. what is the quantifiable difference 
between “agree” and “strongly agree”), but 
some reasons for the discrepancy could in-
clude the pleasure gap present in some het-
erosexual relationships or the societal double 
standards associated with gender and sex.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
14 — Wednesday, December 9, 2020 
statement

T

his September, Netflix announced 
that it would start streaming the film 
“Cuties,” a French film directed by 

Senagalese-French director Maïmouna Dou-
couré, and the Internet went wild. “Cuties” is 
a coming of age film following an eleven-year-
old girl who uses dance to explore her identity, 
against the ideals of her conservative family. 
The film has been critiqued for hypersexual-
izing young girls, as multiple characters under 
the age of twelve are depicted making sexually 
suggestive gestures throughout the movie. A 
rush of Netflix subscriptions cancellations fol-
lowed, and the backlash was so strong that a 
Texas grand jury indicted the film for “promot-
ing certain lewd material of children.” 

Some, however, defended the film, saying 

that many people were missing the point. The 
film was not a promotion but instead a com-
mentary on the hypersexualization of young 
girls in today’s society. It was lewd, by nature, 
forcing us to have a conversation about the hy-
persexualization of young girls, especially dur-
ing the age of social media, which was another 
common theme throughout the film.

This was the first time in my life that I have 

heard such an in-depth and purposeful conver-
sation (albeit a short-lived one) about 
the hypersexualization of young girls, 
especially girls and women of color. As I 
reflected further, I started to realize how 
much this culture of hypersexualization 
has affected my own perception of my 
body as I grew into it as a young girl and 
a woman of color today. 

This hypersexualization of women 

of color is deeply rooted in our coun-
try’s history, dating all the way back to 
the trans-Atlantic slave trade and colo-
nization. Professors LaKisha Simmons 
and Andrea Bolivar from the Women’s 
and Gender Studies at the University of 
Michigan introduced me to the historical 
contexts of the fetishization of women of 
color. 

“There was a concerted effort to de-

fine whiteness as proper humanity, and 
part of that definition involved what 
makes one a man and what makes one 
a woman,” Simmons explained in an in-
terview with The Daily over Zoom. “And 
so you see, these conversations kind of 
intertwined with what we might say are 
excuses, or colonization, and stealing 
both land and human bodies.” 

There is concrete evidence for this in 

the writing accounts of early European 
colonizers and slave traders. In a 1997 
paper, Jennifer L. Morgan, professor of 
social and cultural analysis at New York 
University, wrote, “Writers who articu-
lated religious and moral justifications 
for the slave trade simultaneously grap-
pled with the character of the female Af-
rican body — a body both desirable and 
repulsive, available and untouchable, 
productive and reproductive, beautiful 
and Black.” 

Postcards with pictures of naked In-

digenous and African women on them 
were even sent back to Europe to entice 
men to come to settle in the New World. These 
writings and postcards had a cynical underlying 
intention. 

“They’re trying to justify access to bodies, 

whether for labor or force for sex and justi-
fied various forms of violence,” Simmons ex-
plained. “So on the one hand you have to say 
that these are not regular women like the ones 
back home, right? And then on the other hand, 
you’re also saying that they’re somehow extra 
desirable.” 

As a Latina myself, I was interested in what 

led to the hypersexualization of Latinas spe-
cifically. In an email interview with The Daily, 
Bolivar gave me valuable insight on the history 
of hypersexualization of Latinas in the U.S. 

“Scholars have argued that Latina women 

are constructed as hypersexual and overly ro-
mantic in order to distance them from, and thus 
bolster, the white heteronormative family and 
nation,” Bolivar said. “Racialized/sexualized 
stereotypes also justify violence, including sex-
ual violence, against Latinas, and other women 
of color.” 

East Asian women also experience hypersex-

ualization. Like other WOC, they are exoticized 
and fetishized for their looks. They are stereo-
typed as being submissive, a justification for ac-
cess to their bodies. 

This issue is further complicated when we 

look at the intersectionality between being a 
woman of color and in the LGBTQ+ commu-
nity. Bolivar, whose research allows her the op-
portunity to work with transgender Latinas in 
Chicago, explained the challenges faced in this 
overlap of identities. 

“They challenge cisgender notions about 

gender, the body, and the relationship between 
gender and the body, and they challenge the 
gender binary — all of which are foundational to 
personhood and membership in larger society,” 
Bolivar explained. “As a result, their bodies are 
objectified, fetishized, and hypersexualized.” 

At the inception of the country we know of 

today as the United States, those in power — 
white, land-owning men — were creating sys-
tems and a culture that inherently served to dis-
empower WOC. In fact, colonizers associated 
African and Indigenous women with wildlife to 
justify the inhumane treatment of these groups. 

“Hypersexuality is associated with animail-

ity, so claiming that they were hypersexual 
bolstered the association with animals, which 
of course justified genocide and enslavement,” 
Bolivar wrote. “We, as a nation, have inherited 
that reality, but have yet to reckon with it. BI-

POC and BIWOC have inherited this trauma in 
our bodies.” 

These systems continue to exist today and 

have a lasting impact on the women of color 
living in the United States. For example, the 
U.S. gender wage gaps disproportionately af-
fect women of color. For every $1 a white man 
makes, Latina/Hispanic women make $0.54, 
American Indian and Alaskan native women 
make $0.57, Southeast Asian women make 
$0.61, Black women make $0.62 and Hawaiin/ 
Pacific Islander women make $0.68. This ineq-
uity makes sense, considering the systems that 
exist were built to the benefit of whiteness and 
maleness, viewing those of color as “others” or 
exotic beings existing in a completely different 
category.

Women of color today are also more prone 

to experience acts of domestic and sexual vio-
lence. Black women experience intimate part-
ner violence at a rate that is 35 percent higher 
than their white women counterparts. Trans-
gender women of color are also a group very 
vulnerable to this abuse. A 2012 study showed 
that 61.5% of victims from hate violence homi-
cide were women, many of whom were trans-
gender women. 

“It is incredibly important to recognize 

violence against trans women of color,” Boli-

var said. “That is the first step in combating it. 
However, at the same time, trans women of col-
or have become associated with death, which is 
dehumanizing and dangerous.” 

As far as standards of beauty are concerned, 

women of color still exist in a dichotomous 
space where we are both disgusting and desired 
at the same time. This weird place of fetishiza-
tion is fixated on all forms: from our hair tex-
ture to our curves to our accents. We are con-
stantly “othered” and outcast in the workplace 
or in school, but we are simultaneously consid-
ered the most beautiful women in the world.

Growing up, I subconsciously felt this tug of 

war inside of me. I am Dominican and Danish, 
existing in two different worlds with two very 
different standards of beauty. I was raised in 
New York City, in spaces that were predomi-
nately white, where I was seen as different 
from many of my peers. When my Caribbean 
curves began to form, changing the shape un-
derneath my dance leotards, and as my breasts 
and hips grew, stretching the fabric of my favor-
ite clothes, a sense of shame began to creep in. 
When I walked down the street, the male gaze 
became more aggressive — more like a hungry 
stare. I began to dissociate from my body. 

I did benefit from many privileges in my 

Dominican culture because I have glimpses of 
European features: light brown skin, hazel eyes, 
“good” curls, a curvy physique, a European last 
name. My POC peers would reach for my curls 
and gently tug to test if my hair was real. They 
would ask me to look into the sunlight so they 
could observe the golden specks in my hazel 
eyes and see if they were just contacts. I would 
be told that my brown skin made me look taína, 
the Indigenous people of my country, which is 
the utmost compliment in Dominican culture. I 
was made to feel beautiful as if I was a uniquely 
and meticulously handcrafted piece of art. 

At the same time, I was told that many of the 

things that made me beautiful in my Domini-
can culture were ugly in the white spaces I ex-
isted in. White peers of mine would ask if they 
could feel my boobs or if I could flash them, 
as if they had never seen a woman with curves 
before. They would assume that I slept around 
often and asked about my sexual experience, 
but would also say that I would get more atten-
tion from guys if my skin was a lighter shade. 
It is in these spaces that my white peers felt 
entitled to my body: to critique my shape, to 
ask me personal questions about my sex life 
and to touch me. It’s as if I have been walking 
down a tightrope my entire life, teetering be-
tween being beautiful by some and undesirable 

by others. 

Of course, standards of beauty shift with 

time — they are never stagnant. What was con-
sidered beautiful for women in the 1960s is not 
the same as what was considered beautiful for 
women in the 90s. When I scroll through my In-
stagram feed, I notice that the standard of beau-
ty emerging seems to be something I was once 
made to feel ashamed about: having curves. 
Namely, having a big butt and big boobs.

Enter the Kardashians/Jenners. I really do 

believe that Kim Kardashian and her family 
have made big butts and breasts more accept-
able and desirable in mainstream society. This is 
illuminating in itself: A family of white women 
using their privilege to iconize what has been 
used to stigmatize women of color for centuries. 

“It’s really about monetizing Blackness or 

whatever, but they can do it in a way that actual 
Black women cannot … It’s actually like leaning 
into your privilege as a white person to be able 
to use Black culture and style and look, and then 
make money off of it,” Simmons explained. 

But this is nothing new. The entertainment 

and music industry has a long history of hijack-
ing ethnic minority cultures for profit.

Reflecting on the scope of and my own per-

sonal experiences with this issue made 
me feel stuck. How could I possibly fight 
a problem that is both so deeply rooted in 
our society and in my internal dialogue? 

Then, while I was trying to pick out 

what to listen to for a run one day, I coin-
cidentally stumbled upon Brene Brown’s 
podcast “Unlocking us” with Sonya Re-
nee Taylor on her book “The Body Is 
Not an Apology.” The description of the 
podcast mentioned words of radical self-
love, which I reflexively rolled my eyes 
at. I have stuffed my mind before with 
one too many self-love podcasts and 
books, telling me how I can grow more 
comfortable in my own skin. Would this 
one be able to offer me anything differ-
ent? But I was going on a long-distance 
run and needed something inspiring to 
listen to, so I gave it a try. I expected 
the podcast to be cliché, filled with talk 
about ways to love yourself and to be-
come comfortable in your own skin by 
accepting yourself for who you are. 

Boy, was I wrong. 
Instead, Taylor presented self-love as 

a means of social activism. She went on 
to discuss how systems in our society tell 
so many people to dislike their bodies — 
from people with disabilities to people of 
color to plus-size people. By constantly 
putting ourselves down and apologizing 
for our appearances, we are contributing 
and upholding the same systems which 
disempower us. I had goosebumps for 
the entire hour or so of my run.

But expecting every WOC to reject all 

systems which oppress them is a tall order 
to ask. We all have different experiences, 
traumas and identities we hold that must be 
dealt with and understood. It’s a personal 
journey. So I turned to academics for per-
haps a more clear answer: I asked Bolivar 
what I and fellow women of color could do 

to walk the fine line of sexual empowerment with-
out feeling like we are being exoticized. 

“Something that felt empowering yesterday 

may feel icky today,” Bolivar said. “So I guess my 
one piece of advice would be to check in with your-
self often. And don’t hold yourself to others’ ex-
pectations about how you “should” feel, and what 
“should” be empowering or disempowering,” she 
responded. 

That’s just it. The journey into growing into 

your sexually empowered self is a personal one. It’s 
not linear, it’s dependent on circumstances, a trial 
and error. But it requires being gentle and compas-
sionate with yourself, even when all external pres-
sures and your subconscious want to do otherwise. 

I can only hope that the conversations sur-

rounding the hypersexualization of WOC don’t 
just stop with the conversations we had in Sep-
tember on the film “Cuties.” Uncomfortable 
conversations and confrontations with reality 
need to be conducted. The most empowering 
thing we can do is have those conversations in a 
way that doesn’t victimize women, instead, ac-
knowledging their positions and honoring their 
stories.

P

lease, no, not on social media. I *heart 
emoji* you so much and really no. Sa-
vor it for the personal and unique, 

not the masses,” read the comment my aunt had 
left on a photo I posted on Instagram last week. 
The photo was of me, with my back to the cam-
era, wearing a bra and a thong. Before I posted 
the photo, I had texted it to my group chat with 
friends from high school.

“Do y’all think this is too scandalous to post 

on my Instagram?” I asked them. They all re-
plied with a resounding “No,” which was fol-
lowed by compliments on the photograph and 
questions about where I had gotten the lingerie. 

Excited, I uploaded the picture. My phone 

began notifying me of countless likes and com-
ments surrounding the picture. I got the typi-
cal rush of dopamine that comes with posting 
anything on social media and receiving positive 
feedback. The photo had been up for a cou-
ple of days and I was happy with it. I thought 
it looked nice with the rest of my feed and it 
seemed like most other people did too. 

After day three of the photo being posted, 

my aunt left her comment. In consequence, 
almost as quickly as the photo was uploaded, 
I archived it. Immediately after, I deleted the 
entire Instagram app from my phone. I didn’t 
want a reminder of her comment or of the pho-
to. I sat on the floor of my room, my cheeks hot 
with embarrassment.

“I probably looked like such a slut to other 

people who weren’t bold enough to comment 
as my aunt did!” I thought to myself. I thought 
about the fact that the first man I had ever had 
sex with, who I hadn’t talked to in five years 
and who never usually likes my Instagram 
posts, had liked the image. “God…” I thought. 
“He only ever wanted me for my body anyway.” 

My head filled with thoughts of self-hatred 

and anxiety. I questioned my intentions behind 
posting the photograph. Did I post it so the men 
on my page would see it and find me attractive? 
Did I post it because I felt good? Did I post it 
because I wanted to contribute to an Instagram 
environment where scandalous photos like the 
one I posted are normalized? Did I post it be-
cause I wanted to celebrate the female figure?

All these questions didn’t seem to have an 

answer. Maybe these rationalizations were all 
true, maybe none of them were. I felt put into 
a bind: I didn’t know if my post was self-em-
powering or if my post contributed to patriar-
chal exploitation and sexualization. Why did 
my photograph have to contribute to that? I 
certainly didn’t intend for it to — but it seemed 
that my aunt’s notions of its appropriateness 
lent itself to unsolicited sexualization of my 
body. Or … was it solicited because I had posted 
it on my Instagram? Why did a photo of me in 
lingerie have to be sexual anyway?

My relationship with my own sexuality has 

never been something I’m ashamed of. Before 
entering a monogamous relationship, I regular-
ly participated in hook-up culture. I enjoy sex 
— like, a lot. I’ve always been excited to explore 
different areas of my sexuality, and quite frank-
ly, my relationship to sex is something I take a 
lot of pride in. I felt comfortable with sex and 
wearing lingerie, and I felt comfortable enough 
to post that photo on my Instagram. 

So why was I so incredibly embarrassed 

when my aunt commented on my post? Perhaps 
because in the generation she grew up in, any-

thing related to sex was seen as a more private 
activity than it is now. To my aunt, the photo of 
me in lingerie was inherently sexual. I did see 
it as a rather sexy post, but that didn’t make it 
bad. Why did my aunt think that exposing my-
self sexually on social media was something I 
shouldn’t do?

At first, I saw my aunt’s comment as a reflec-

tion of myself: Because I posted a sexy photo 
on my Instagram, I was asking to be sexualized, 
which meant I was a slut. Yet, I started to think 
about why posting a sexual photo on Instagram 
made me think of myself as a slut? When I saw 
other people post “scandalous” photos on their 
Instagram, I’ve never thought that of them. I 
think it’s because oftentimes, women are made 
to feel ashamed for expressing themselves in a 
sexual light. I had control over my Instagram 
and what photos I posted. This made posting 
the photo an act of sexual empowerment. How-
ever, I don’t have control over how other peo-
ple will react. Nor do I think I need to.

I realize now that my aunt’s comment was 

a reflection of her and her own relationship to 
sex. From her comment, I could see that my 
aunt thought photos that were more sexual 
should be personal and unique, whereas my ap-
proach to sexual photos and sex overall is that 
if it makes you feel good, do it! While I see her 
perception of sex as valid, it isn’t the same as 
mine. 

Everyone else who liked the photo or saw it 

on their Instagram feed has their own unique 
relationship to sex. Perhaps they wouldn’t feel 
comfortable posting a photo in lingerie on their 
Instagram feed. That’s perfectly fine with me 
and I understand their viewpoint, but it doesn’t 
mean I should feel bad or guilty for posting it 
on my own. 

Especially from the heteronormative male 

perspective, women can be sexy privately, but 
not publicly. They can be sexy for their partner, 
but the minute they recognize their own sexual 
identity and develop a desire to showcase that 
to the world, they are subject to ridicule and 
slut-shaming. Why is a woman taking owner-
ship of her own sexuality deemed something to 
be ashamed of? 

I’ll never truly understand why my aunt 

commented on my post. She said “I *heart emo-
ji* you so much,” which makes me think she did 
it out of love. Maybe she sees the way women 
are viewed and sexualized in society, and she 
doesn’t want that for me. I don’t want that for 
me either. Which is why rather than deleting 
my post entirely, I decided to delete her com-
ment. If my aunt or anyone has a problem with 
my Instagram photo, that’s something they can 
investigate on their own time. Because it truly 
has nothing to do with me. 

When women are modest, they are seen as 

boring. When women are sexual, they are seen 
as easy. If we, as women, are going to be contin-
uously placed into boxes, I suggest that rather 
than trying to adhere to societal standards of 
what we should and shouldn’t be, we do what 
feels good to us. Whether that’s posting a scan-
dalous photo on your Instagram or having a 
feed that’s only kittens and food porn. No mat-
ter what women do, someone will always have 
something to say about it, so as long as we’re 
not harming anyone else in the process, let’s 
embrace what we’ve got and forget about the 
rest.

The B-Side: Harry Potter and the Canceled Author

It’s time that we talk about ‘The Fault in Our Stars’

I grew up in a house in the middle of 

the woods, surrounded by deer and trees 
and friendly small-town neighbors, but 
I spent a lot of my childhood immersed 
in books instead. Something about the 
allure of a different world enthralled me; 
magical, fantastical or realistic, I wanted 
the adventure that novels promised to take 
me on. 

Joanne (Jo) Rowling dreamed of 

escaping her troubled marriage. A school 
teacher who thought herself a failure, 
Rowling left with her child and scouted 
for somewhere safe, somewhere she could 
truly get more out of the life she desired for 
herself. At the same time, she put pencil to 
paper and began to sketch out the story of a 
young wizard boy, which had miraculously 
come to her, fully-formed, while on 
a train. Fully shaped by her mother’s 
death and own mental health struggles, 
Rowling finished her manuscript and 
two years later saw “Harry Potter and the 
Philosopher’s Stone” become a smash hit. 

Long before I was able to read on my own, 

my father would sit in a white rocking chair 
and, with my chubby little body on his lap, 
read to me. I can’t remember every book we 
read, though we definitely worked through 
Dr. Seuss and wore down my copy of “Felix 
Travels Back In Time,” and I vividly recall 
us reading through the entire Harry Potter 
series one chapter at a time.

The world of Harry Potter seemed vast 

and alluring, that of a young mistreated 
boy becoming the chosen one in a world 
full of magic and magical creatures. The 
adventures were grandiose and epic, a 
battle of good versus evil wickedly waged 
with wands and incantations. I loved it. I 
wanted to taste a chocolate frog, a barf-
flavored Bertie Bott’s bean and feel the 
warmth of a freshly brewed Butterbeer. I 
wanted to live among the characters, who 
even at the height of their angst embarked 
on daring adventures while attending the 
coolest boarding school imaginable. The 
series of seven bestselling books and eight 
blockbuster films became a pop culture 
staple throughout the world.

As I got older, I found myself returning 

to Harry Potter during times of comfort 
and hardship. The first film premiere I 
ever attended was “Harry Potter and the 
Deathly Hallows - Part 1.” My friend and 
I were two of the only non-costumed 
people in line. I saw the play “Puffs, or 
Seven Increasingly Eventful Years at a 
Certain School of Magic and Magic” off-
Broadway twice and am dying to see both 
parts of “Harry Potter and the Cursed 
Child” on the Great White Way. During a 
difficult year, I completed a whole re-read 
of the entire saga and watched all the films 
again. What started as a silly children’s 
series became a cultural touchstone for 
many people’s adolescence. I know that my 
friend is clearly a Slytherin in all the best 
ways possible, or how to pick on someone 
because they’re a Hufflepuff to a tee. 
Playground talk about our dream houses 
— I’m a Ravenclaw obviously — became 

a real discussion of how our personality 
traits fit into these fictional constraints. 
Our generation didn’t just grow up with 
Harry Potter, Harry Potter grew up with 
us. 

My Dad used to hold me as I nodded off, 

lids heavy with the magic sleep of a child’s 
day gone by. As I got older and bigger, I 
would lay down in my racecar bed and 
listen to him preach the exploits of Harry, 
Ron and Hermione. The chair older than 
I was would always squeak. After each 
chapter was done, he would close the 
book — he magically always knew where 
we were in it — and come over and kiss me 
goodnight. 

Things started to get weird after 

the series was done. Rowling, rather 
than letting everything sit pretty and 
untouched, started to mess with the status 
quo in a hasty attempt to answer questions. 
Sure, there was a Jewish wizard, his 
name was Anthony Goldstein and he 
was a Ravenclaw, next. Oh no, wizards 
absolutely do not take off their entire robe 
to use the bathroom, they simply shit into 
their pants and wave it away with magic, 
duh. There were LGBTQ+ students at 
Hogwarts, you just never saw them. 
WAIT, now Dumbledore is gay. How’s that 
for representation? It would be comical if it 
wasn’t so pathetic. 

But the slope of Rowling’s quick retcons 

soon became slippery. Suddenly all the 
malicious subtext hiding within the books 
became prominent once people bothered 
to go below the surface. Why did these 
wizards exist only in England? Why was 
the history of magic so white-centric? 
How come Cho Chang and Dean Thomas 
were the only two prominent people of 
color in an entire school of students? The 
faults crumbled into fissures and soon 
working through the world of Hogwarts 
became a game of dodging potholes. 

Then … the infamous Pottermore 

post about magic in early, pre-colonized 
North America. The history was not only 
horribly inaccurate but insensitive and 
white-washed, 
constantly 
comparing 

these Native American wizards to their 
European counterparts in disgusting 
ways. The feedback was loud and angry. 
This wasn’t some little joke Rowling 
could get away with on Twitter, it was a 
targeted attack against an entire people, 
a slight against all Indigenous American 
tribes that only furthered their erasure in 
history. 

Jo Rowling began to play the offensive. 

Her Twitter was used for responding to 
any and all criticisms of her which she 
completely ignored while working on 
the new, glitzy “Fantastic Beasts” series. 
When people questioned why the goblins 
were so reminiscent of Jewish stereotypes 
or why lycanthropy, otherwise known as 
the process of turning into a werewolf, is 
a metaphor for HIV/AIDS, they were met 
with a wall of silence. Even when Rowling 
did something progressive, such as cast 
Black actress Noma Dumezweni (“The 
Undoing”) as Hermione in the original 
London production of “Cursed Child,” 
she backed it up with questionable quotes 
about Hermione’s unruly curly hair and 

brown eyes. Rowling constantly showed 
that she was not only out of touch but 
unable to recognize her problems and 
change. Some people, even those whose 
lives had been changed by Rowling’s 
work, made the decision to cut her out of 
their lives and stop supporting her and her 
work.

Things were quiet for a little while. 

“The Crimes of Grindelwald” was a critical 
flop and Rowling was getting along fine 
writing her Cormoran Strike detective 
novels. Frankly, no one cared about either 
of those projects. But on June 6, 2020, 
the sixth day of Pride month, Rowling 
responded to an op-ed’s use of the phrase 
“people who menstruate” by joking about 
the word woman being erased, effectively 
negating the trans safe space the original 
wording created. She received backlash 
but kept at it, demanding that sex and 
gender be connected and continuing to 
demean the transgender community. 

She was speaking and acting like a 

trans-exclusionary radical feminist, or 
TERF, something a later blog post of 
hers originally titled “TERF Wars” only 
continued to prove. Rowling wrote that 
being transgender was a mental disorder, 
that it encouraged children to change their 
gender before they could change their 
minds and other demoralizing reasons to 
be worried about new trans activism. The 
mask was off, the convertible top down 
— Rowling finally stepped into the light 
as the bigoted woman she was. No more 
pretenses or quick retcons to calm fans, 
Rowling nearly shouted, “I’m transphobic 
and I’m proud of it!” 

Responses flooded the internet, with 

Harry and Hermione themselves, actors 
Daniel Radcliffe (“Swiss Army Man”) 
and Emma Watson (“Little Women”), 
decrying the statements and standing 
alongside the trans community. Rowling 
continued her shitstorm, continually 
denouncing 
hormone 
therapy 
and 

possibly even suggesting that people who 
take medication for mental health issues 
are simply “lazy.” The launch of her next 
book, “Trouble Blood,” only worsened the 
issue by having the villain be a — and I 

absolutely wish I was joking — cisgendered 
man who dresses as a woman in order to 
kill other women. Rowling hates transfolk 
for simply trying to live their lives and feel 
comfortable in their own skin. She had 
picked a hill to die on, but it was turning 
out more like Custer’s Last Stand than the 
Alamo. 

One day, for whatever reason, as my Dad 

and I were at the tail end of “Return of the 
King” (we had moved onto Middle Earth at 
that point) I looked him in the eyes and said, 
“I don’t want you to read to me anymore. 
I can do it.” Looking back now, it was 
heartbreaking. From that day on I’ve read 
books alone, because I felt it was time to 
move on. So the rocking chair sat quiet and 
untouched, until one day I decided it was 
time to move on, get rid of it and put a desk 
in its place instead. 

As I sit here and type this, my 

Ravenclaw bracelet constantly catches my 
eye. I struggle to reconcile this modern 
Rowling with the woman who wrote such 
a beloved, important series of books. I 
can’t whisk away my enjoyment of them 
in the past: There are still a good 15 years 
of Harry Potter affection that remain in 
my memory. But as a non-binary human 
being, I cannot simply sit here and take 
Rowling’s comments as comments. They 
are hateful and demeaning stances that 
hurt deeply to hear. 

This isn’t an issue for everyone. For 

some people, doing something famed 
literary 
critic 
Roland 
Barthes 
calls 

“Death of the Author” (summarized and 
contextualized brilliantly here by critic 
Lindsay Ellis), can work. The concept is 
that one should divorce the personal views 
and actions of an author from their work, 
stating that their view is simply one of 
many interpretations possible. This may 
work for some people, likely the same 
ones who pay full price to see the new 
Mel Gibson movie and are ecstatic to see 
Felicity Huffman acting again, but it’s 
incredibly difficult for others.

Rowling’s hate and prejudices are baked 

into the text of Harry Potter; there is simply 
no way around that. I am not trying to 
discount any single person’s interpretation 

because if you got something out of this 
series, nothing Rowling or anyone else 
says can ever take that away from you. But 
I find it difficult to think about supporting 
this series the way I once did. I hide away 
my Harry Potter socks and feel a pang of 
guilt each time I think about the Friday 
Forty and how I would probably spend a 
ridiculous amount of money to see “Cursed 
Child.” With a new Harry Potter video 
game set to come out next year, Avalanche 
Studios’s “Hogwarts Legacy,” and the 
third Fantastic Beasts film in production, 
people are going to need to take a stance on 
Rowling sooner rather than later. Either 
they boycott her or support her. 

Now as an adult, I wonder why I ever 

asked my father to stop reading to me. I 
always feel guilty about it, like I broke his 
heart. I can say I never went back to finish 
“Return of the King” either, it just never 
felt right. Time has allowed me to keep the 
memories close to me, but has also allowed 
enough distance for me to see that I made 
the right decision. My dad and I formed a 
different relationship, not one out of him 
reading to me but us reading as equals. He 
started choosing books specifically for me. 
I still do the same for him. We manage to 
find time to talk about whatever he chose to 
borrow from the library this week. As heart-
wrenching as it is, sometimes moving on is 
the right thing in the end.

Personally, I say it’s time to move on from 

Rowling and her TERFy shenanigans. 
Just like with storytime and my racecar 
bed, it’s time to take Rowling and put her 
to the curb. No more chances, no more last 
second sways of the heart due to nostalgia, 
no more “but one more butterbeer,” which 
frankly was never that good to begin with. 
Let’s hang up our brooms, put our wands in 
storage and stand firm together and affirm 
that Rowling doesn’t get another pass. We 
will always have our fond memories. The 
siren calls toward a comfortable but now 
tainted land, and that’s enough for me.

No, John Green has not been 

officially “canceled.” In fact, his work 
remains quite popular: His latest book, 
“Turtles All the Way Down” (2017), 
debuted at #1 on The New York Times 
bestseller list, and in 2018 Green 
confirmed its film adaptation. Last 
August he announced that he will be 
publishing his first work of non-fiction 
in May 2021. So, no, Green isn’t canceled 
in the sense that we have all agreed to 
stop reading his work and unsubscribe 
from his YouTube channel, but he is 
canceled for me. And he has been for 
quite some time. 

To be truthful, I was always a great 

admirer of Green’s work, particularly 
in middle school. His Young Adult 
fiction is known for its young female 
readership, something that held true 
in my school district and friend group. 
I can’t remember which novel I picked 
up first, but “The Fault in Our Stars” 
was undoubtedly my favorite — a love 
story between two young and beautiful 
cancer patients? It was as if its sole 
purpose was to attract romance-giddy 
teens. 

Regardless, by the time I reached 

high school, I separated myself from 
his work and most of YA fiction. 
This isolation wasn’t provoked by a 
controversy surrounding Green, nor 
had I simply grown out of the genre; I 
still loved the glorious romances that 
were stuffed into my bookshelves. I 
was just afraid to admit it. 

It was around the same time others 

did fervently stop reading Green’s 

books because they were “for girls” or 
“not actually that good” or “overrated.” 
Maybe other YA fiction readers have 
encountered the same sentiment — that 
because we enjoy books with cheesy 
friendships or coming-of-age themes, 
we must be superficial. So I can’t blame 
my first dissociation with Green on 
him, but I can hold him responsible for 
the second. 

Unfortunately for me and John 

Green, I was diagnosed with a rare 
form of cancer when I was 17. It was 
an odd experience: The diagnosis and 
the scans and the surgery didn’t feel 
like they were happening to me, but 
to someone else. Maybe another me 
in a different universe, or someone 
else entirely. Either way, like many 
survivors of cancer, I had adapted 
a new perspective. A new way of 
seeing things, both things trivial and 
significant, including the way society 
treats disease and diseased people. 
Especially John Green. 

When I reread “The Fault in Our 

Stars,” it wasn’t so I could relate to 
Hazel or Augustus or the other cancer 
patients depicted. I subconsciously 
started reading it on one of the dark 
days anyone fighting illness, whether 
it be mental or physical, knows well. 
I picked it up out of muscle memory: 
I had read it on multiple occasions 
when I was in need of comfort or a 
distraction. It was simply one of those 
times. I depended on the trustworthy 
characters and their cliché remarks 
to provide some degree of relief. 
Something to softly pull me out of my 
reality and into another. 

And the truth is, I both enjoyed and 

detested the book. Lines like “Grief 
does not change you Hazel. It reveals 

you,” and “But I believe in true love, you 
know? I don’t believe that everybody 
gets to keep their eyes or not get sick or 
whatever, but everybody should have 
true love, and it should last at least as 
long as your life does” stuck out to me. 
As tacky as they may appear, they were 
successful in distracting me from my 
metastatic cancer. 

But what also stuck out to me were 

the fallacies. Green invents the therapy 
that keeps Hazel alive. It’s not real. In 
the acknowledgements section of the 
book, Green writes: “The disease and 
its treatment are treated fictitiously 
in this novel. For example, there is no 
such thing as Phalanxifor. I made it up, 
because I would like for it to exist.”

And that’s not fair. Not for cancer 

patients like me whose cancers don’t 
have definitive treatments; not for 
those who live in constant uncertainty 

and fear; not for those who are told that 
we will just have to monitor our bodies 
for the rest of our lives, as long as we 
may live. And I know this is a work of 
fiction; I know that Green is entitled to 
create any fantasy he would like. But 
does fantasy belong in a book about 
cancer? 

Perhaps it is shocking because 

of Green’s other statements: “This 
is 
hopefully 
not 
going 
to 
be 
a 

gauzy, sentimental love story that 
romanticizes 
illness 
and 
further 

spreads the lie that the only reason sick 
people exist is so that healthy people 
can learn lessons.”

But if the only reason his main 

character is alive is because of a made-
up treatment, isn’t he glamorizing 
the scarce miracles and hope some 
cancer patients may have? By keeping 
Hazel falsely alive to share with us her 
newfound wisdom upon Augustus’s 
death, does it not turn into her and 
her experiences becoming a lesson for 
healthy people? 

And Green does not stop there. The 

other principal character and cancer 
patient, Augustus Waters, is said to 
have just been re-diagnosed with 
cancer right before embarking on a 
grand adventure to Amsterdam with 
Hazel. In what world is that possible? 
Having Augustus endure the long trip 
and the exhaustive tours around the 
city while simultaneously maintaining 
his emotional and mental capacity is 
another delusion I cannot forgive. 

It is also difficult to ignore the other 

unreasonable decision to have the two 
cancer patients share their first kiss 
inside the Anne Frank house. Not to 

mention the heedless combination of 
cancer and the Holocaust, something 
like a kiss should — and would — 
never happen inside so sacred a place. 
Did Green think it would not matter 
because it is cancer patients performing 
the act? That they were not normal, 
healthy people, so in turn their actions 
should be excused in exchange for pity?

My particular position might make 

me overly sensitive to Green’s mistakes 
— but that’s another comment I’m sick 
of hearing. My sensitivity stems from 
my truth, as does my criticism. The 
errors of authors like Green do not 
deserve to be disregarded because of 
their merit or their well-intentioned 
ventures 
into 
sensitive 
subjects. 

Instead, that’s exactly why they should 
be held accountable. By putting their 
work and themselves into the world, 
they are inviting both criticism and 
praise. 

“The Fault in Our Stars” is expertly 

problematic because its flaws can be 
easily overlooked. However, other 
errors of Green are not so deftly 
unnoticed: His repetitive usage of the 
same rudimentary character tropes 
and his lack of diversity in terms of 
race, gender and sexuality (noting 
a few exceptions: Tiny from “Will 
Grayson, Will Grayson,” Hasan from 
“An Abundance of Katherines,” and 
Radar from “Paper Towns”) make 
me wonder why Green has been, and 
continues to be, such an influential 
figure in YA fiction, and why he hasn’t 
been canceled before.

The B-Side: How has ‘South Park’ not been canceled?

Should “South Park” be canceled?
With 
debates 
spawned 
by 

controversial episodes raging across 
Twitter 
and 
echoing 
on 
Reddit 

subthreads, “South Park” remains 
as scandalous as it was back in 1997. 
Mocking 
Clinton’s 
sex 
scandals, 

Scientology and the Virgin Mary with 
equal vigor, the show has done double 
duty as a cultural touchstone and as 
an argument for why you shouldn’t 
let your kids watch Comedy Central. 
Yet over the past two years, many 
have called for the animated show 
to be canceled — claiming that South 
Park has raised a generation of trolls 
inspired by the racist, hate-fueled 
vitriol spewed by main character, Eric 
Cartman. With these considerations 
in mind, is there still a place for South 
Park in 2020? I rewatched some 
episodes to find out. 

By chance, the first episode I came 

across was the “South Park Christmas 
Special” from 2006. Written during 
the height of the war on terror, the 
episode follows Cartman, Stan, Kyle 
and Santa Claus as they attempt to 
bring Christmas to the downtrodden 
children of Iraq. Over the course 
of the episode, Santa’s sleigh gets 
shot down by an RPG over Baghdad, 
Saddam Hussein electrocutes Santa’s 
testicles and Jesus Christ is murdered 

by terrorists. Oh, and back in South 
Park, Colorado, Timmy, the show’s 
resident 
child 
with 
a 
disability, 

stammers through a garbled version 
of a “Partridge in a Pear Tree.” It’s 
ludicrous, 
hilarious 
and 
utterly, 

blatantly offensive. 

But would the episode have aired 

today? In the age of “cancel culture,” 
where Lana Del Ray was “canceled” 
for wearing a mesh face mask, it 
seems unlikely that a show satirizing 
terrorism, making fun of children 
with disabilities and even going 
after Jesus Christ himself would be 
allowed to continue. Shows have been 
canceled for far less or at minimum 
altered to satisfy politically correct 
ideals. Even classic cartoons aren’t 
safe — Elmer Fudd, the rabbit-hunting 
denizen of “Looney Toons,” has had 
his iconic hunting rifle replaced 

by a scythe. “The Simpsons” have 
removed the character of Apu, who 
was 
said 
to 
perpetuate 
harmful 

Indian stereotypes. Yet, somewhat 
inexplicably, 
“South 
Park” 
has 

survived the media purges unscathed. 
The show is in its 24th season and 
shows no signs of stopping anytime 
soon. So how has “South Park” been 
able to avoid cancellation? 

The answer lies in their even-

handed satirization — of everything. 
The show’s creators, Trey Parker 
and Matt Stone, don’t single out one 
specific race, culture or religion. They 
rarely even taunt the same celebrities, 
preferring 
instead 
to 
lampoon 

hundreds of America’s most famous 
figures over the past two decades. 
“South Park” can’t be accused of 
discrimination; they ridicule everyone 
with equal glee. Not unlike the fool 
in the king’s court, the only person 
allowed to tell the truth without 
fearing retribution, “South Park” has 
played the role of America’s jester to 
a tee, revealing society’s hypocrisies 
and laughing giddily along the way. 

Notorious for their tongue-in-cheek 

humor, Parker and Stone are unafraid 
to self-satirize, too. This attitude was 
best exemplified by a video released 
on “South Park”’s official Twitter in 
2018. With white words on a black 
background, a booming voice reads 
off the following text: “America has 
reached a crossroads. What will 
we 
do 
next? 
#CancelSouthPark.” 

Shortly 
thereafter, 
the 
hashtag 

#CancelSouthPark 
was 
trending. 

Many assumed the show’s creators 
finally gained a conscience — or that in 
Trump’s America, the comedy’s once-
outrageous world of “South Park” now 

seemed tame. All speculation was 
moot; the hashtag was no more than 
a marketing gimmick. Never afraid 
to break the fourth wall, Parker and 
Stone were once again poking fun 
at themselves and an increasingly 
prevalent cancel-culture. 

If 
“South 
Park” 
was 
like 

“Family Guy,” it would be viewed 
anachronistically, like “Fuller House” 
or some other show that has been 
dragged, kicking and screaming, out of 
the 1990s. Yet more than any animated 
television show, “South Park” has 

remained remarkably relevant, due 
to their rapid production process. 
Each 30-minute episode is produced 
in six days (most animated television 
series have production periods of 3-6 
months) allowing for timely humor 
and a degree of relevancy most other 
series can’t aspire to. More akin to 
“Saturday Night Live” than “The 
Simpsons,” South Park’s spur-of-the-
moment humor has allowed them to 
stay one step ahead of cancellation. 

I ended my viewing spree by 

watching “The Pandemic Special,” the 
first episode of the show’s 24th season. 
Covering the impact of the coronavirus 
on the inhabitants of “South Park,” 
the town’s children are forced to 
quarantine at school under the guard 
of the district police force, implied 
to be unemployed due to their poor 
handling of the Black Lives Matter 
protests. The episode controversially 
features 
Token, 
the 
show’s 
only 

African American character, being 
shot by the town’s chief of police for 
coughing in the classroom. Was this a 
heartless attempt at a cheap laugh, or 
does it satirically raise awareness of 
police brutality? I’ll leave that for you 
to decide. Regardless, South Park’s 
unique timeliness, absurdity and pure, 
comic stupidity ensure it will remain 
a controversial cultural force for years 
to come.

You can’t cancel Fiona Apple, not even in 1997

“This world is bullshit.” 
After a tumultuous past year (to put 

it lightly), you’re probably nodding your 
head in agreement. But 23 years ago, this 
statement provoked a slightly more severe 
reaction. 

Fiona Apple, the then 19-year-old 

alternative pop singer, shocked the world 
with her utterly honest and expletive-
laced acceptance speech at the 1997 VMA 
Awards. After winning Best New Artist for 
the single “Sleep to Dream” off her debut 
album Tidal, Apple delivered a brief but 
soon-to-be infamous message to her fans, 
explaining, “I didn’t prepare a speech and 
I’m sorry, but I’m glad I didn’t because I’m 
not gonna do this like everybody else does 
it.” 

Toddling her chrome astronaut award 

from hand to hand, Apple added, “See, Maya 
Angelou said that we, as human beings, at 
our best, can only create opportunities. And 
I’m gonna use this opportunity the way 
that I want to use it.” Her words, already 
deviating from the formulaic thank-you-
filled speeches of her peers, were met with 
some intermittent applause, but mostly 
bewildered silence. Apple continued, “So, 
what I want to say is — um, everybody 
out there that’s watching, everybody 
that’s watching, this world? This world is 
bullshit. And you shouldn’t model your life 
about what you think that we think is cool 
and what we’re wearing and what we’re 

saying and everything. Go with yourself.” 
A sprinkling of audience members clapped 
at this affirmation, enthusiastic if not a bit 
puzzled. After a few hurried thank-yous 
to her family and producer, Apple cinched 
the speech with one final thought: “It’s just 
stupid that I’m in this world, but you’re all 
very cool to me so thank you very much.” 

Almost instantaneously, the media 

launched into a frenzy. In just under a 
minute and 20 seconds, it seemed that 
Apple had managed to collect enough 
criticism to last for years. The press 
labeled the young artist as everything from 
woefully ungrateful to wildly precocious, 
a reputation that stuck with Apple for 
much of her musical career (and arguably 
still does today). She was essentially, as 
we’ve coined the term, “canceled” for 
being unabashedly honest. Apple’s brazen 
take on an already taboo issue was merely 
fuel to the fire for her developing “bad 
girl” rep. With the release of the sexually 
suggestive “Criminal” music video, Apple 
had already made clear her unwillingness 
to fit into the good-girl charade that’s often 
dumped on female pop stars. With bright 
blue eyes, a brooding alto voice and an 
unfiltered matter-of-factness, Apple was 
by all accounts developing into pop diva 
material. But this prima donna persona 
did little to cushion her from the brutally 
harsh discourse of gossip columnists and 
distinguished music critics alike. 

One such critic of The New Yorker 

characterized her as an “underfed Calvin 
Klein model”; another NY Rock journalist 
remarked that her speech was “one of 

the most ridiculous soliloquies ever to 
be witnessed at an MTV Awards event.” 
Comedian Janeane Garafalo even went as 
far as to mock Apple’s eating disorder in a 
blistering parody, stating, “You shouldn’t 
model your life about what you think that 
we think is cool . . . Even though I have an 
eating disorder and I have somehow sold 
out to the patriarchy in this culture that 
says that lean is better.” It’s a disappointing, 
if not unsurprising, reaction to a young 
artist’s openness. Given the media’s 
constant fixation with women’s bodies, 
it’s also unsurprising that Apple’s physical 
appearance became a focal point in almost 
every fuming article and subsequent album 
review. There was no escape from the 
piercing opprobrium of an industry eager to 
mark Apple as a moody teen, permanently 
on the verge of a breakdown. Luckily 
for us, this didn’t stop her from making 
breathtaking music. 

I started listening to Apple this past year 

with the release of her long-anticipated 
album Fetch the Bolt Cutters (I know, I 
know, I’m extremely late to the party). 
Needless to say, I tore through her entire 
discography in a day, mesmerized by 
Apple’s sharp lyricism and unconventional 
pop sound that makes you question 
everything you think you know about the 
genre. My visceral reaction on first listen 
was how gloriously refreshing Apple’s 
voice was. She didn’t shy away from hard 
questions and blunt truths of life, and I felt 
at home in this mania of biting, vulnerable 
sincerity. 

For the same reason, I believe Apple’s 

1997 VMAs speech is a resounding victory. 
Beneath its overtone of teenage angst and 
clumsy delivery, Apple presents a gem of 
a message. As a young female artist in the 
era before social media, receiving a massive 
platform to talk candidly about toxicity in 
the music industry was incredibly rare. 
Apple merely vocalized the frustration 
thousands of other women in the public eye 
had been feeling for years before her. Not 
only that, but she addressessed the feeling 
of inadequacy and “uncoolness” that comes 
from being an adolescent on the peripheries 
of a celebrity-obsessed culture. In all 
honesty, maybe we have that speech to 
thank for Apple’s incredible artistry today. 
Standing there on national television, in 
front of hundreds of people, Apple seemed 

to reach a moment of clarity. She got a taste 
of pop stardom and subsequently decided it 
went against everything she stood for. 

Despite their best efforts, critics failed 

to cancel Apple. With each fiery criticism, 
her commentary on the artificiality of the 
American music industry is only proven 
further. Since 1997, Apple has released four 
more albums, each more introspective and 
mature than the last. In a sense, she’s finally 
been justified. Despite all the dizzying 
circumstances, Apple has found freedom in 
being unfailingly outspoken. Only this time 
it’s not in an acceptance speech, but in the 
intimate lines of her musical masterpieces.

Why you’re still listening to Azealia Banks in 2020

Though maybe not an A-list celebrity 

anymore 
(she’s 
too 
merciless 
for 

invitations to ornate parties or wine 
nights in gilded mansions), Harlem-
based rapper Azealia Banks has stuck 
around. She’s still in your friend’s 
Spotify feed, albeit normally on private 
mode so it’s hard to know unless you 
bring it up. She has maintained just 
under two million monthly listeners 
on Spotify (with no mixtape release 
in 3 years), has been nominated for 
dozens of awards and this year even had 
an unreleased demo, “Competition,” 
become particularly popular on TikTok 
with over 53,000 videos recorded to the 
track.

What makes this interesting isn’t 

that Banks has lost her talent. Her most 
recent single, “Black Madonna,” peels 
back her typical cover of electronic 
clamor to reveal her effortless flow 
and vicious lyrical jabs as much as 
ever. Rather, Banks has been canceled 
endlessly (and rightfully so) on Twitter 
and 
its 
compatriot 
social 
media 

sites. To list all of her transgressions 
would itself take up an entire article; 
a comprehensive list on Wikipedia 
will show the long-winded extent of 
Bank’s controversy. The sins range 

from impressively articulate, narrative-
length jabs at Kanye West and Iggy 
Azalea to homophobic and transphobic 
posts that have resulted in temporary 
bans from Twitter.

Skipping discourse about ignoring 

Banks’ canceled status or “separating 
the art from the artist” — because these 
mental gymnastics are the ultimate 
reasons people are still willing to listen 
in the face of controversy, and have been 
written about time and time again — 
what drags people back to Broke With 
Expensive 
Taste? 
Unlike 
listeners’ 

failed campaigns to cancel Kanye 
West or Chris Brown that seemed to 
have inflicted no effective damage, 
with Banks, listeners have the unique 
foresight to slip into private mode (as 
two of my friends have confessed that 
they do) but still are consuming the 
music. People are wary enough to avoid 
association but are still seeking tracks 
like “Anna Wintour.”

A combination of factors likely 

account 
for 
these 
contradictory 

habits. For one, the nature of Banks’ 
music — rabid hip house covered in 
brash lyricism — is an amalgamation 
perhaps best-suited to engage with her 
degree of aggression and controversy. 
The style isn’t constructed for the 
type of close listening that so many 
personality-centered pop stars and 
thoughtful alternative artists elicit. 

Listening doesn’t feel like engaging 
with a conversation; it’s something 
amusing to consume, like what you’d 
put on to dance around to after getting 

good news. Half of Banks’ lyrics are so 
muddled, anyways, almost obscured 
completely by the heavy blanket of the 

beats she creates and sticky in the way 
they gum together as she raps straight 
through the song, so the sense that 
clicking play on something you’ll need to 
think about feels absent when listening. 
The overwhelming consensus among 
supporters online runs along the lines 
of this, too: She’s immoral, she’s crazy, 
but she makes good, irreplaceable beats.

This isn’t to say that the writing on 

Broke With Expensive Taste or mixtape 
Slay-Z is underdeveloped. In fact, 
Banks’ ability to lay out brisk, fiery bars 
with full-throated aggression makes 
the listening, in the half of the lyrics 
that are comprehensible, even more 
difficult to turn down. The lyrics don’t 
feel profound; they feel sassy and fun 
to shout along with. From “212” (“And 
when I hit that dip get your camera / 
You could see I’ve been that bitch since 
the Pamper,”) to demo “Competition” 
(“She’s like, ‘Hey where’ve you been 
honey?’ / What it look like, bitch? Getting 
this money!”), Banks pendulum-swings 
from creative self-flattery to genius 
retorts. You can find another poet, but 
the dancefloor hip hop that moves these 
tracks, and the spiked lyrics in them, 
couldn’t have been made by anyone else. 
They’re addictive, full of lines you wish 
you would’ve thought of yourself, and 
that just makes them more fun to get 
lost in.

From the get-go, too, Banks has 

told the world she’s controversial and 
doesn’t care, which likely suggests 
some self-selection by fans to explain 
her continued following. Her bellicose 
genre-melding and lyrics (even when 
unintelligible) ask listeners not to take 
her too seriously. But her listeners 
probably already didn’t care. Maybe 
they lauded Banks for edginess. Her 
first single and most streamed song, 
“212,” uses the c-word a grand total of 9 
times. She’s been tweeting belligerently 
nearly her entire career. Her songs (see 
“Heavy Metal and Reflective”) have 
always been exaggeratedly explicit.

Which is all to say that Azealia Banks 

is still creating unique, quarrelsome, 
sharp music that blends rap with the 
beats you lose your mind to in clubs, 
and that people are still consuming it. 
At this point, it feels like this might turn 
out to be a small-scale Trisha Paytas 
phenomenon — “uncancelable,” so to 
say, for many listeners, with revelations 
changing things only for those who have 
gone into hiding on private mode. The 
collective decision to “cancel” Banks, 
and stop streaming until she owns up to 
her actions, might be easier to achieve if 
anyone in the industry was mixing like 
she is. Nobody is, and until then, the 
streaming will continue.

18 — Wednesday, December 9, 2020

This article is a part of the Daily 

Arts “Canceled” b-side. For a full 
look at our b-side pieces exploring 
this theme, visit our site.

Season four of Netflix’s “The 

Crown” opens with a lunchtime 
conversation 
at 
Buckingham 

Palace. Queen Elizabeth II (Olivia 
Colman, “The Favourite”) sits at 
the end of a long table stacked with 
food and flower arrangements as 
she inquires about her eldest child: 
“No Charles?” she asks. The Queen 
is surrounded by other members 
of her family — husband Philip 
(Tobias 
Menzies, 
“Outlander”), 

sister Margaret (Helena Bonham 
Carter, 
“The 
King’s 
Speech”), 

daughter Anne (Erin Doherty, 
“Call the Midwife”) and in-law 
Lord Mountbatten (Charles Dance, 
“Game of Thrones”) — but Charles 
(Josh 
O’Connor, 
“God’s 
Own 

Country”) is notably absent. 

The group proceeds to gossip 

over the Prince’s personal life, 
reviewing a list of women whom 
he may hold in contention for 
marriage. It’s 1977, and the pressure 
for the heir apparent to find a bride 
is reaching a tipping point. 

There 
was 
one 
woman 

photographed by the newspapers in 
a bathing costume, says the Queen, 
and another that Anne describes 
as a “heck of a horsewoman.” Then 
there is Camilla Parker-Bowles 
(Emerald Fennell, “Killing Eve”), 
who is already married but still 
mysteriously close to the Prince.

“Oh, he’s not still seeing her, 

surely,” the Queen says. “After all 
the lengths we went to,” referring 
to her concerted efforts to keep 
the Prince and her monarchy away 
from unwanted scandal. 

“No, none of these,” says Lord 

Mountbatten, who was famously 
close with his nephew. The latest 
acquaintance is Sarah Spencer 
(Isobel Eadie), elder sister of a 
woman 
named 
Diana 
(Emma 

Corrin, 
“Misbehaviour”). 
The 

camera cuts to a car driving down 
a wooded countryside far outside of 
London — Charles is at the wheel, 
on his way to the Spencer estate. 
He’s on his way to meet Diana 
Spencer. 

Much of the following nine 

episodes centers on the infamous 
story of this relationship — of the 
teenager 
who 
married 
Prince 

Charles in a crinkled masterpiece 
of a taffeta ballgown when she was 
only 19 and he was 31. Show creator 
Peter Morgan tells a complex 
narrative of two faulted individuals 
bound to a marriage that was 
broken from the start. The season 
follows Diana’s personal battle 
with bulimia and depression that 
is exacerbated by a lack of support 
from her new in-laws. On top of 
this, she faces explosions of jealousy 
from 
Charles 
whenever 
her 

presence takes too much attention 
away from him and battles with her 
own dejection as it becomes clear 
that the Prince’s relationship with 
Camilla never truly ended. 

“Camilla is who I want!” Charles 

screams at Diana toward the end 
of the final episode. “That is where 
my loyalties lie,” he says. She looks 
at him blankly, heartbroken and 
unsurprised at the same time. 

These conversations are of course 

dramaticized inferences of what 
really happened behind the scenes 
of this crumbling relationship, but 
Morgan contextualizes this fiction 
in the backdrop of history from 
the penultimate decade of the 20th 
century. Diana and Charles fight 
as Britain reckons with a growing 

resentment toward the monarchy 
while unemployment skyrockets 
under the leadership of Margaret 
Thatcher. This is the formula that 
has worked so well for Morgan’s 
first three seasons of what is 
one of Netflix’s most successful 
shows to date. Characters based 
on the Royals we know as public 
figures combat intimate personal 
turmoil as they navigate the public 
struggles written about in our 
history textbooks. Up until now, 
no one seemed to be bothered 
about where the facts ended and 
the fiction began. But as the show’s 
setting quickly approaches present 
day, the tension between these two 
is hard to ignore. 

Morgan’s 
depiction 
of 
the 

now-deceased Princess and the 
still-alive future King of England 
ignited a new wave of hatred for 
the faults of Prince Charles and his 
family. Critics have been quick to 
point to Morgan’s shortcomings in 
the show’s depiction of reality — 
that “The Crown” only shows one 
unfortunate side of Charles, that it 
fails to emphasize Diana’s role in 
the marriage’s failure and that it 
might destroy the efforts of Charles 
and his now-wife Camilla in the 
last quarter century to separate 
themselves from the hostility of the 
1980s. 

Perhaps this is true; the TikTok 

teens and Twitter trolls don’t seem 
too enthusiastic about forgiveness. 
One especially funny video started 
with a woman looking in the 
mirror as she melodramatically 
told Charles, “You better count 
your days!” The TikTok accrued 
2.2 
million 
views 
and 
was 

shared over 40 thousand times. 

Music Talks: Metalcore 

“Music Talks” is a series in which 

Daily Music Writers give their takes 
on the biggest releases in new music. 
However, this time, we picked a 
release that’s not exactly new, and 
not exactly big, but allows some 
of our writers to introduce other 
writers to a genre they normally 
wouldn’t listen to. From picking best 
and worst tracks to asking what 
makes a genre tick, the Music beat 
is here to give praise and to give shit 
to music worth talking about.

I discovered the Australian 

metalcore quintet Thornhill on 
a YouTube comments section 
I will never find again. Their 
full-length 
debut, 
‘The 
Dark 

Pool,’ immediately struck me as 
an album worth sharing, both 
entrenched in genre but also 
universally fascinating for any 
appreciator of music. Thornhill’s 
label, UNFD, is a hotbed for fresh 
and zany ideas in metal. It provides 
an interesting lens to discuss the 
band in the larger context of what 
metal is and where it’s going — 
here’s what we had to say about 
The Dark Pool. 

—Anish Tamhaney, Daily Film 

Beat Editor

This interview has been lightly 

edited for clarity and concision. 

Tamhaney: So I’d love to 

start off by just hearing — what 
are 
your 
one-to-two-word 

thoughts 
about 
‘The 
Dark 

Pool’?

Drew Gadbois, Daily Arts 

Writer: Heavy melody. 

Jason Zhang, Daily Arts 

Writer: Surprisingly lyrical.

Kai Bartol, Daily Arts Writer: 

Exhilarating. 

Nora 
Lewis, 
Daily 
Arts 

Writer: This is kind of broad, but 
I think unexpected.

Sam Cantie, Daily Music Beat 

Editor: Stressed out, in a sci-fi 
world.

Julianna Morano, Managing 

Arts Editor: I wrote down — like 
a continual beating. 

Q: I would call this album 

comfortably experimental, and I 
think that aligns with what a lot 
of you were talking about with it 
being a little bit heavy and wild, 
but also lyrical and melodic. Does 
anyone want to expand on that or 
talk about that dichotomy?

Gadbois: I think I’m gonna 

be the odd one out here, but I 
didn’t think it actually was that 
experimental. I think I had a slight 
knowledge of metalcore to begin 
with, so like, having that prior 
knowledge, I think it allowed me to 
have a little better context behind 
it. There was a way they used 
melody that felt very unique. They 
built melody around a heavy pulse 
and it adds a lot of momentum, 
but it didn’t necessarily push you 
away.

Zhang: 
Yeah, 
I 
was 
just 

surprised by how much of it was 
more of creating a soundscape, 
and them really playing around 
in what I would say is a mellower 

field. And then they would use 
juxtaposition, and they would go 
into a more intense driving melody 
and beat and then return back to 
more of a mellow zone. That made 
it continually interesting to listen 
to. 

Lewis: Yeah, I agree. I feel 

like that prevented it from losing 
intensity at harsher moments. It 
prevented it from being sort of 
watered down. 

Morano: I think something 

that I’m not accustomed to is that 
there’s not a lot of build-up up to 
intensity. It was kind of, on or off, 
sort of. And anytime there was a 
moment of silence, I was bracing 
myself because I knew it was 
going to end quickly, and I didn’t 
realize that I liked that until I was 
listening to this. 

Tamhaney: Yeah, that makes 

sense. Because I think especially 
a lot of the breakdowns on this 
album kind of come out of thin air, 
like you said. But I definitely agree 
with what a lot of you are saying: 
The pacing of this album, it feels 
really organic. And I think that 
really does just go back to melody, 
because it just feels like the 
melody writes itself, and it writes 
this whole album. And they don’t 
really stick to any structure or any 
kind of formula, it happens in this 
natural way.

Cantie: I think I appreciated 

that 
it 
wasn’t 
extremely 

experimental, like I could tell 
that you were trying to give us 
something that incorporated more 
melody to ground those who have 
never listened to metal before. 

I think something I was left 
thinking about is the relationship 
of metalcore to anger, because 
I feel like I have a complicated 
relationship with anger, and I 
don’t get angry, ever. It got me 
thinking about the ways in which 
women get angry. So I might be 
opening us up to something like, 
too big to talk about, but I’m sort 
of wondering whether metalcore 
is extremely, like, male-dominated 
in “listening-ship”? Is that a word? 
Probably not. But I think I’m just 
most astonished by the anger 
component of metalcore. 

Gadbois: That’s a really good 

point, and I think this goes beyond 
just deathcore, but what I’ve kind 
of noticed, with more aggressive 
genres in general, like industrial 
and stuff like that, a lot of the 
more upcoming female artists are 
representing a female anger and 

recapturing anger as something 
that can be female-driven. I think 
it’s a really interesting topic, 
and I think it is becoming more 
diversified. 

Tamhaney: 
Yeah, 
a 
great 

example that I’ve been into lately 
is Spirit Box, they’re another 
metalcore 
band 
fronted 
by 

Courtney LaPlante. And she’s 
incredible. I think she’s an 
example of exactly what you’re 
saying, of transforming what 
anger can look like or what it can 
sound like, even. 

Q: Let’s get into some specifics 

on this album. Are there any 
standout tracks or moments that 
you want to talk about that really 
stuck with you?

Bartol: There was one part of 

“In My Skin” that I had to write 
down because I loved it a lot. The 
main vocals that you’re hearing 

were very melodic, and very 
normal, but then they dubbed 
the words with the vocalists 
screaming the same words, and I 
loved the feeling of tension created 
between the melodic vocals and 
the screaming going on in the 
back.

Morano: Wait Kai, I think 

same. I rewound that part: I think 
that one seemed to exhibit more of 
a build up. And then an outro with 
just a repeating lyric, and that was 
something else that listening to 
this and really liking that song 
made me realize that I do, like — 
because it was such an unfamiliar 
musical experience, it made me 
think in more meta terms about 
my own listening habits and what 
I like. But yes, Kai!

Reconsidering monolithic 
masculinity: On Brando

This article is a part of the Daily 

Arts “Canceled” b-side. For a full 
look at our b-side pieces exploring 
this theme, visit our site.

The 
clickbait-y 
corners 

of the internet are rife with 
dubious articles about closeted 
stars 
of 
Hollywood’s 
past, 

salacious stories about long-
dead 
icons 
of 
film: 
Greta 

Garbo, Montgomery Clift, Joan 
Crawford, 
Marlon 
Brando. 

These stories share an unsettling 
subtext: the intimation that non-
heterosexuality reflects poorly 
on these men and women or 
that their illustrious careers and 
contributions to the history of 
film are somehow diminished 
by their sexualities. One such 
article, 
posted 
on 
Medium 

and written under the ironic 
pretense of celebrating Pride 
Month, is particularly deplorable 
for its homophobia and tabloid-
style headlines (one of which 
calls Montgomery Clift “a fussy 
and hard to please bisexual”). 
While 21st century celebrity 
coming-out announcements may 
be met with more praise than 
condemnation, we need not look 
far into the past to find ridicule 
of Golden Age icons that borders 
on “cancellation.”

I adore Tennessee Williams, 

and Elia Kazan’s film adaptation 
of “A Streetcar Named Desire” 
will always be one of my favorite 
films. 
Accordingly, 
Marlon 

Brando, 
who 
so 
brilliantly 

inhabits 
the 
role 
of 
the 

emotionally volcanic, brutish 
and sweaty Stanley Kowalski, 
is one of my favorite actors. 
Which is why I remember a 

number of articles published 
in February 2018. It all began 
with an unfiltered interview 
with legendary music producer 
Quincy Jones in Vulture, in 
which he remarked of Brando 
that, 
“He’d 
fuck 
anything. 

Anything! He’d fuck a mailbox. 
James Baldwin. Richard Pryor. 
Marvin Gaye.” This “allegation” 
which supposedly “sent the 
internet into a frenzy,” according 
to 
TMZ, 
was 
corroborated 

by comedian Pryor’s widow 
Jennifer Lee Pryor. “It was the 
’70s! Drugs were still good, 
especially 
Quaaludes,” 
Pryor 

said. “If you did enough cocaine, 
you’d fuck a radiator and send it 
flowers in the morning.”

This story was widely reported 

by the likes of the Guardian, USA 
Today and the entertainment 
glossies. Pryor’s daughter Rain 
and Brando’s son Miko both 
denied Jones’s claims, adding 
fuel to the fire and longevity to 
the story. There is no dearth of 
Brando smut on the internet, 
which all begs the question, who 
cares? In an unsigned opinion 
article from South African news 
broadcaster eNCA responding 
to the February 2018 Brando 
brouhaha, the author accurately 
noted that “in the feeding 
frenzy 
which 
has 
followed 

Jones’s interview, we have also 
learned (once again) how deep 
the roots of heteronormativity 
and 
homophobia 
still 
run.” 

With 
particular 
disdain 
for 

Jennifer Lee Pryor’s statements 
about Quaaludes and cocaine, 
the author wrote that “We are 
asked to understand any sex 
between Pryor and Brando as the 
consequence of drugs, not as an 
aspect of the men’s exploration 
of being human. In fact, both 

men are compared to objects, 
thus domesticating the threat 
their human sexual interaction 
poses to heteronormativity.”

Jennifer 
Lee 
Pryor’s 

dehumanizing 
aside, 
the 

media obsession with Jones’s 
claims reflects a belief that 
homosexuality 
is 
aberrant. 

That there is something “dirty” 
about 
the 
secret 
that 
has 

been exposed. This is no new 
phenomenon. In the 1950s, the 
tabloid 
Confidential 
“called 

out celebrities who were in the 
closet, in rehab or having marital 
problems,” purportedly to “show 
the real image of America,” 
said journalist Henry Scott, 
an image hidden by the films 
these very celebrities created. 
But glorifying Confidential as 
breaking barriers and fighting 
Hollywood idealism hides the 
ugly truth: It was a mechanism 
for “cancel culture,” that innate 
human drive to excommunicate 
that which we perceive to be 
harmful to our society. In 1955, 
agent Henry Willson “learned 
that Confidential was planning 
to out Rock Hudson, who still 
was one of his clients,” said 
Tab Hunter, a former client of 
Willson, “so he cut a deal with 
them to keep Rock out of their 
pages, feeding them dirt on me 
instead.” The gossip magazine 
suggested 
that 
Hunter 
had 

attended a “gay orgy,” leaving 
Hunter fearing for his career. 
It took a cover story in another 
entertainment 
publication, 
in 

which he was celebrated alongside 
Natalie Wood, to blunt the impact 
of the Confidential story.

Wednesday, December 9, 2020 — 19

This season, the Michigan 

hockey team’s penalty kill has 
been crucial in shutting down 
high ranked opponents. But on 
Thursday, it was a major factor 
in the Wolverines’ downfall. 

Before its second matchup 

against Penn State, Michigan 
had killed 19 of its 22 penalties. 

“We 
have 
faith 
in 
our 

players,” sophomore forward 
Nick Granowicz said on Nov. 20. 
“We practice our penalty kill a 
lot… it’s worked out for us.”

Facing the Nittany Lions, 

though, all of that skill and 
endurance 
seemed 
to 

fade away. The 
Wolverines 
allowed 
Penn 

State to convert 
on four of its 
six power play 
opportunities. 

Michigan 

coach 
Mel 

Pearson felt the 
out of character 
performance was a product 
of both exhaustion and the 
fact that the Wolverines were 
missing two of their best players 
on the penalty kill: junior 
forwards Garrett Van Wyhe and 
Nolan Moyle. 

With the former injured 

and the latter out with a game 
misconduct penalty, Michigan 
had to rely on their less adept 
members of the roster even as 
it continued to give up penalty 
after penalty. 

“We were playing with fire,” 

Pearson said. “And we got 
burned bad.” 

Even 
within 
that 
game, 

there were moments when the 
prowess of Michigan’s penalty 
kill unit came through. 

Two minutes into the first 

period when the Wolverines 
were already down by two, 

junior forward Nolan Moyle 
earned a five-minute major 
penalty for contact to the head. 
With Michigan already in a 
hole, a five-minute power play 
for the Nittany Lions became an 
opportunity for the Wolverines 
to dig themselves deeper. 

The penalty kill unit held 

Penn 
State 
to 
five 
shots, 

allowing Michigan to escape 
unscathed. 

“That was a critical point in 

the game,” Pearson said. “And 
even though we ended up losing 
the game, at that point, it gave 
us a chance to stay in the game.”

The issue isn’t that the 

Wolverines 
can’t 
kill 
their 

penalties, 
but 
that 
they’re 

racking 
up 

too 
many 
to 

begin 
with. 

Michigan 
has 

had a reputation 
throughout the 
years 
as 
one 

of 
the 
most 

disciplined 
teams 
in 
the 

league. 
But 

in 
their 
first 

eight 
games, 

the Wolverines have averaged 
almost 10 minutes with a player 
in the penalty box and one more 
penalty per game than last 
season.

It’s 
an 
issue 
Pearson 

identified right from the start. 
In Michigan’s first game of the 
season, the Wolverines gave 
up seven penalties but only 
allowed Arizona State to get to 
the net on one.

This 
team 
isn’t 
overly 

physical, 
but 
they 
have 
a 

tendency 
to 
make 
small 

mistakes that end up sending 
someone to the box. A perfect 
example came within the first 
game against the Sun Devils. 
Freshman 
forward 
Brendan 

Brisson touched the puck as he 
was released from the penalty, 
drawing an interference call 
that sent him straight back into 

the box. Pearson said he’d never 
seen the penalty in his entire 
coaching career. 

Those 
types 
of 
small, 

technical errors — what Pearson 
calls “tick-tacky penalties” — 
are expected with a young team 
like the Wolverines. But it’s not 
only the freshmen that have 
continued to make the mistakes. 

Other 
than 
Brisson, 
the 

biggest source of penalties have 
been Moyle, junior forward 
Jimmy Lambert and junior 
defenseman Nick Blankenburg. 

Minnesota 
— 
who 
the 

Wolverines will face on Tuesday 
— is dangerous on the power 
play, converting on almost a 
third of its opportunities thus 
far. And with Pearson unsure 
whether Van Wyhe will be 
ready to play, it will be even 
more important for Michigan to 
limit its penalties. 

“We 
can’t 
be 
taking 

penalties,” Pearson said. “If 
we do, we’re just asking for 
trouble.”

Through the Michigan hockey 

team’s first six games, its lines 
remained 
nearly 
unchanged. 

The only alterations were injury 
replacements and rotations in and 
out of the lineup among its lesser 
skaters.

But after being swept by Notre 

Dame a week ago in a series in 
which the Wolverines scored just 
three goals in two games — none 
of which came on the power play 
in three opportunities — and failed 
to generate any momentum in the 
offensive zone, Michigan coach 
Mel Pearson made some significant 
adjustments entering his team’s 
series against Penn State.

Senior forward Jack Becker — 

who played on the Wolverines’ 
second power play unit — came out 
of the lineup, allowing for tweaks 
to both units. While these tweaks 
were small, they paid dividends. 
Michigan generated two goals 

on five power plays against the 
Nittany Lions.

“We just decided because we 

changed the lines up a little bit to 
change units,” Pearson said. “They 
weren’t drastic. … But I thought 
they played well. I thought our 
power play was really good.”

With Becker as a healthy scratch, 

junior forward Jimmy Lambert 
shifted to his spot both at even 
strength and on the power play, 
allowing senior forward Michael 
Pastujov to replace Lambert on the 
top unit.

Pastujov made an immediate 

impact on the man advantage for 
the Wolverines. In the second 
period of their 3-1 win against Penn 
State on Wednesday, he scored an 
impressive goal directly in front of 
the net, faking out the goaltender 
and putting the puck in an open 
net. The goal ended up being the 
deciding tally for Michigan.

“He knows what to do around 

the net,” Pearson said. “He’s got 
some offensive instincts that he 
knows where to go.”

The 
addition 
of 
Pastujov 

added 
another 
dimension 
to 

the Wolverines’ top power play 
unit that at times has seemed 
predictable. Freshman forward 
Brendan Brisson was the focal 
point, with the goal of every power 
play to get him the puck for one-
timers. While Brisson is dangerous 
from the right circle, he only has 
one goal on the man advantage this 
season, a result of opposing teams 
anticipating his shots.

But with Pastujov on that 

unit, Michigan often worked the 
puck into the slot and Pastujov 
generated 
multiple 
dangerous 

chances in addition to his goal. 
Against the Fighting Irish, Pearson 
thought the Wolverines played 
on the perimeter too much on the 
power play, oftentimes trying to 
force feed the puck to Brisson. 
With the shake-up to the top unit, 
Pearson effectively found a way to 
solve this.

And while it didn’t come against 

the Nittany Lions, if Pastujov 
continues to thrive near the net, 
Michigan should be able to get 
more open looks for Brisson.

For the time being, though, that 

will have to wait. Five Wolverines 
are leaving for World Juniors in 
advance of their two games against 
Minnesota, including Brisson and 
three other players on the top unit 
— sophomore forward Johnny 
Beecher, sophomore defenseman 
Cam York and freshman forward 
Thomas 
Bordeleau. 
With 

makeshift lines for the series, 
Michigan may struggle on the 
power play.

“You’re going to see two different 

(units) this weekend, so get used to 
it,” Pearson said. “I’m gonna throw 
it in the blender and mash it up too. 
So you’re gonna kind of see a little 
bit of everything.”

While playing without nearly 

its entire top unit will be less than 
ideal, the Wolverines may have 
found a power play weapon in 
Pastujov that could be key to their 
success on the man advantage for 
the rest of the season.

Power move

Special teams key in Wolverines’ top-five matchup with Minnesota

Turnovers a lingering issue in win

Danielle Rauch let out a sigh 

of relief. 

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team led all but the 
first seven seconds of the game 
in its 82-59 over Wright State. 
To the naked eye it looked like 
the Wolverines — especially 
their offense — was firing on 
all cylinders. The team as a 
whole shot 49 percent from the 
field, including going 7-for-15 
from 3-point range. 

Firing on all cylinders, right? 
Still, Rauch was relieved, 

knowing the ceiling of this 
team. She knew, despite the 
win, the Wolverines didn’t play 
nearly as well as their potential 
suggests. Thanks to sluggish 
starts to the first and second 
halves, the Raiders remained 
in striking distance — cutting 
the deficit to 12 at the end of 
the third quarter — for far too 
long. 

“We just kind of let them 

speed us up a little bit,” Rauch 
said. “We wanted to just kind 
of settle, settle back down, 
get back to running our stuff, 
go back to what was working, 
and just play our game. We 
definitely want to be able to 
put two halves of really great 
basketball 
together 
in 
the 

upcoming conference (games).”

Once 
again, 
despite 

its 
efficient 
offensive 

performance, 
turnovers 

plagued 
Michigan. 
The 

Wolverines 
committed 
18 

turnovers against Wright State, 
adding to their average of 16.75 
turnovers per game. 

But they limited the damage 

done by some poor decision 
making — as they did in two of 
their three other games against 
Oakland and Central Michigan. 
Wright State had just 10 points 
off these turnovers. This was 
partly due to playing better at 
the end of the halves than the 
beginning. It also has to do with 
the lack of competition, outside 
of Notre Dame, they have faced 
thus far. Despite the turnover 
issues, they started the season 

4-0.

Eleven of the 18 turnovers 

forced by the Raiders came off 
steals. Whether it was picking 
the pocket of junior point 
guard Amy Dilk or intercepting 
an errant pass or half-court 
heave, Wright State was quick 
to attack the ball. There were 
ample opportunities to turn 
these steals into fast break 
points, but the Raiders failed to 
do so. This will not be the case 
when Big Ten play starts. 

The 
offensive 
turnovers 

coupled with trouble on the 
defensive 
end, 
specifically 

trouble defending the glass, 
led to some slight miscues. 
Junior forward Naz Hillmon 
typically 
dominates 
both 

ends of the glass, however, 
she was outsized by Wright 
State’s 6-foot-4 center Tyler 
Frierson. Hillmon was boxed 
out 
consistently, 
something 

that doesn’t usually happen, 
and the Raiders dominated the 
offensive boards with 26. 

“(Better 
rebounding) 
as 

well as limiting turnovers, I 
think that’s the biggest thing,” 
Rauch said. “Just kind of really 
honing in on making every 
possession count and taking 
care of basketball.”

This offensive rebounding 

discrepancy can be explained by 
Michigan’s switch to a 2-3 zone 
defense. With non-conference 
competition 
winding 
down, 

the Wolverines wanted to gain 
more experience playing in this 
scheme knowing they would 
give up offensive rebounds. 

“They’re 
a 
team 
that 

dribble penetrates very well,” 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico said. “They got in the 
paint a lot in the first half. 
We wanted to make sure we 
protected the paint and try to 
take away their paint touches. 
We knew we were probably 
going to play them in zone, and 
it was good for us to work on 
that defense as well.”

Some of the sloppy play can 

also be attributed to the team’s 
effort to give their bench 
players meaningful minutes. 
With 
a 
highly 
competitive 

conference 
like 
the 
Big 

Ten, 
giving 
young 
players 

experience early in the season 
could be invaluable. 

“I think we are very deep 

with a lot of experience,” 
Rauch said. “You saw today 
that people gave really great 
minutes. 
Everyone 
works 

extremely hard. We all trust 
each other. We’re only as 
strong as our weakest link. We 
want to make sure that we’re 
a balanced attack from one 
through 13.”

Despite winning by 23 points 

in the end and improving to 4-0 
in the process, with one non-
conference game remaining, 
there are still plenty of kinks 
to work out. This was a win, 
but it also wasn’t against a Big 
Ten quality opponent. The 
Wolverines will need to shore 
up the turnover issue if they 
expect to achieve their goal of 
a Big Ten championship. It’s 
yet to be seen if there will need 
to be more sighs of relief in the 
future.

Michigan beats Wright State, 82-59

Coming off a historic win 

against Notre Dame on Thursday, 
the Michigan women’s basketball 
was confident going into its game 
Sunday against Wright State.

Yet 
the 
Wolverines 
(4-0) 

showed they still have work to do 
in a 82-59 victory over the Raiders 
(0-2).

Wright 
State’s 
inability 
to 

make shots and Michigan’s own 
efficient 
shooting 
saved 
the 

Wolverines from sloppy play — 
turnovers, questionable passing 
and allowing second-chance shots 
on defense.

Junior guard Amy Dilk had a 

momentous first quarter, earning 
the 300th assist of her career. Still, 
as it did against the Fighting Irish, 
Michigan struggled at first with 
turnovers, giving up the ball seven 
times in the first quarter. All told, 
Dilk and junior forward Leigha 
Brown finished with five and four 
turnovers, respectively.

“We let them speed us up a 

little bit,” Rauch said. “We wanted 
to settle back down, get back to 
running our stuff, go back to what 
was working, and just play our 
game.”

Michigan continued to hit their 

shots, though, through the first 
quarter, ending with Dilk finding 
junior guard Danielle Rauch for a 

3-pointer to close it out. 

Down low, the Raiders’ defense 

frustrated junior forward Naz 
Hillmon early on. Starting the 
second quarter with only three 
points, she made up for that slow 
start by going eight-for-eight from 
the line and ending the half with 
14 points and six rebounds.

Hillmon’s 
early 
troubles 

weren’t the only thing indicative 
of Michigan’s struggles under the 
rim. Outrebounded on its own 
glass, Wright State’s 26 offensive 
rebounds led to 26 second-chance 
points. The difference came from 
a Wolverine team experimenting 
with a zone defense for the first 
time this season. 

“We wanted to make sure we 

protected the paint and tried to 
take away their paint touches,” 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico said. “It was better, except 
for the fact that it gave them 
the opportunity to rebound the 
basketball well.”

Standout performances from 

Brown, Dilk and Hillmon in the 
second quarter gave Michigan the 
edge, ending the half with a 48-27 
lead. 

Brown was the difference in 

this matchup, coming into the 
second half buzzing. Whether 
it was a layup or jump shot, her 
versatility in shot making and play 
creation 
furthered 
Michigan’s 

lead. She led the team with 24 

points. 

Brown’s ability to score is 

crucial, but not the only way she 
affects the game. 

“I thought she helped us on the 

rebounding end tonight,” Barnes 
Arico said. “She helped us with 
her toughness and she was able 
to get out and transition a bunch 
with the ball in her hands and 
finish some great plays. She had a 
great night.”

The third quarter came with 

a switch in momentum, with 
the 
Raiders 
outscoring 
the 

Wolverines 19-10 in an attempt at 
a comeback. Wright State had 20 
offensive rebounds going into the 
fourth quarter, while Michigan 
had just eight. 

The 12-point margin heading 

into the final quarter wasn’t as 
large as it should have been on 
paper, but in the final quarter 
the Wolverines at last put their 
struggles behind them. 

“Once we settled in and moved 

the basketball and executed some 
stuff, we had some tremendous 
possessions in the fourth quarter, 
where we really looked good,” 
Barnes Arico said. “I thought that 
was important there. They were 
super physical and tried to take us 
out of what we wanted to do.”

In spite of the flaws Michigan 

came out strong in the fourth and 
found a way to extend its lead, 
putting the game out of reach.

The Michigan women’s basketball team overcame sloppy play to blow out Wright State on Sunday.

JULIA SCHACHINGER/Daily

Turnovers plagued Michigan all afternoon, though it managed to win.


20 — Wednesday, December 9, 2020
Sports
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Oftentimes in practice, the 

Michigan men’s basketball team 
plays exhibitions between its first 
and second units. Normally, the 
result is exactly what you’d expect 
it to be.

“We may beat them a few times 

but most of the time (the starters 
are) beating up on us,” senior 
forward Chaundee Brown said.

In 
Sunday’s 
80-58 
victory 

over Central Florida, though, the 
second unit proved to be the most 
productive players on the floor 
for the Wolverines. Trailing by 
12 points midway through the 
first half, Michigan coach Juwan 
Howard 
subbed 
in 
freshman 

forward Terrance Williams to join 
junior forward Brandon Johns 
Jr. and freshman center Hunter 
Dickinson in the frontcourt. The 
Wolverines needed a spark, and 
they delivered. 

“Soon as I came in on the floor, 

(Johns) talked to me, he was like, 
‘Be a dog, bring energy, do what 
you do,’ ” Williams said, after 
finishing with 10 points and six 
rebounds. “And that instilled a lot 

of confidence with me because he 
believed in me.”

Immediately 
after 
entering 

the 
game, 
Williams 
brought 

energy and then some. On his first 
possession, he converted a three-
point play and followed it up with a 
mid-range jumper on the next trip 
down. For Williams, coming off the 
bench and making a difference is a 
role he’s familiar with, and one that 
he is more than happy to play for 
his squad.

“(Coming off the bench), it’s not 

a jarring difference,” Williams said. 
“I’ve been in this position before.”

Dickinson proved to be a 

difference-maker as well. Though 
he didn’t enter the game until 
around the 13-minute mark and 
struggled early on, Dickinson 
looked far more confident on the 
offensive end once Williams joined 
him on the floor. Dickinson threw 
down a massive jam off an offensive 
rebound 
following 
a 
missed 

3-pointer to cut the Knights’ lead to 
three and later converted another 
second chance bucket to put the 
Wolverines up 33-30 following a 
jumper from Williams. 

“On the offensive glass with his 

length, it’s always good to have 
him,” Howard said. “If you miss a 

spot, he’s there to clean it up. Or if 
he gets in the low block, he’s there 
to finish it.”

While Dickinson has come 

off the bench as a reserve for the 
season’s first four games, he has 
arguably been one of the team’s 
most consistent performers on 
a nightly basis, scoring 14 points 
and hauling down seven rebounds 
tonight 
to 
mark 
his 
fourth 

consecutive double-digit scoring 
performance. As is the case with 
Williams, Dickinson has embraced 
his role on the bench. 

“He’s a total team guy,” Howard 

said. “He trusts the process and 
that’s a coach’s dream, to have a 
guy that’s all in and trusts what we 
can bring to the table to help him be 
successful.”

Four games into the season, 

Howard has twice called on the two 
freshmen to deliver a spark for his 
team, and the pair has responded 
on both occasions. Last Sunday, 
Michigan was also struggling, and 
the duo helped spark a second half 
rally, with Dickinson scoring 19 
points and Williams contributing 
seven. On Sunday afternoon, the 
final 10 minutes of the first half, 
Williams and Dickinson combined 
to score 16 out of the team’s 22 
points.

“The chemistry’s really good 

between us,” Dickinson said. “But 
I think the chemistry among us all 
is really good. I think this team is 
really close and everybody’s really 
close-knit and I think we all work 
really well together.”

In the second half, Michigan 

rode the hot shooting touch of 
fellow reserve Brown — who 
finished with 19 points and four 
3-pointers — to cruise to a relatively 
easy win. Johns also added a 
strong effort on loose balls and the 
offensive glass. 

The game looked like it had all 

the makings of an upset special 
early on, but the team’s reserves 
were the ones to turn it around in 
the Wolverines’ favor.

“They changed the game for us,” 

Howard said.

Chaundee Brown had a long 

list of suitors this offseason. 

The 
2016-2017 
Florida 

Gatorade Player of the Year and 
former Wake Forest guard was 
coming off a season in which 
he averaged 12.1 points and 
6.5 rebounds for the Demon 
Deacons. The appeal was evident 
— the program that landed 
Brown was getting a battle-
tested veteran, a capable shooter 
and a frisky defender who had 
held his own against stiff ACC 
competition. 

Brown announced in mid-

May that he would transfer to 
Michigan, turning down the 
likes of Gonzaga, Illinois, Iowa 
State and LSU. While Brown 
wouldn’t have started for the 
Bulldogs and Illini — ranked No. 
1 and No. 6 respectively in the AP 
Top 25 Poll — he very well could 
have for the latter two teams, 
or a number of mid-majors for 
that matter. Instead, though, he 
chose the Wolverines knowing 
that his minutes may be limited. 

“We 
just 
have 
so 
much 

talent,” Brown said. “... I know 
that myself, (senior guard Eli 
Brooks), (sophomore wing Franz 
Wagner) and (graduate guard 
Mike Smith) we all have to 
sacrifice each other’s minutes, 
shots, things like that. But that’s 
why I came here. I knew I was 
probably gonna come off the 
bench here. I have no problem 
with that. I just wanted to win. 
That’s all, I wanted to win.”

Brown 
didn’t 
do 
much 

winning during his career in 
Winston-Salem going 35-58 in a 
three-year span. In finding a new 
team, winning was a priority. 
So far, so good for Brown and 
Michigan. The Wolverines are 
4-0, and excluding an overtime 
scare 
against 
Oakland, 
the 

results were never in doubt. 

In addition to crisp ball 

movement and a well-rounded 
offensive 
attack, 
Michigan’s 

bench play has been the driving 
force behind its early success. 
In no game was this on display 
more than in Sunday’s 22-point 
demolition of UCF — the highest 
ranked opponent the Wolverines 
have faced this season according 
to KenPom. Michigan’s bench 
accounted for 49 of the team’s 
80 points and Brown led the way 
with an efficient 18 points on 
7-for-12 shooting. 

“I have a second unit that is 

selfless,” Michigan coach Juwan 
Howard said. “They have bought 
into their roles. Truly the star 
was Chaundee … he’s accepted 
the role of being the sixth man 
for us and he’s perfecting it. It 
says a lot about his character.” 

Against 
the 
Knights, 
the 

Wolverines found themselves 
in a double-digit hole midway 
through the first half. With 
Wagner in foul trouble and 
the starting unit struggling 
to 
score, 
Michigan 
turned 

to 
Brown, 
freshman 
center 

Hunter Dickinson and freshman 
forward Terrance Williams to 
dig it out of it. 

“The bench guys, we’re all 

D1, division 1,” Brown said. 
“(Coach Howard) knows that 
we have game. Coach Howard, 
all the coaches recruited us for a 
reason. He saw it in AAU and in 
college basketball.

“Just coming off the bench, 

that’s a different role. We’re 
sacrificing a lot of things that 
on other teams, we would’ve 
been star players or starting but 
we’re taking a second role on a 
winning team. We’re just always 
ready.”

Through the first four games, 

Brown’s ability to hit 3-pointers 
has been on display. At 44% 
— and with an average of 6.25 
attempts per game — Brown 
leads the team in that category. 
Whether his stellar conversion 
rate is more of a product or 
a cause of the Wolverines’ 

dynamic offense is unclear, but 
his confidence from deep is at an 
all-time high. 

“I believe in my shots,” Brown 

said. “I work on my shot hours a 
day, hours and hours in the gym. 
Before the game, before practice, 
after practice, I just work on my 
3-point shots a lot and I just felt 
like I’ve been getting good looks. 
Can’t turn down a good look. 
Coach Howard always tells us, if 
you pass up an open shot it’s like 
a turnover for us. So all the open 
shots I get, I try to take them.”

Howard added: “I watched a 

lot of film on him. I knew that 
he was a knockdown shooter. I 
kept telling my staff about it, and 
we were having conversations 
as we were quarantined in our 
homes. … We talked about — one 
of the things that he provides 
is something that we can truly 
enjoy as a staff and also as a team 
is his outside shooting. So it was 
no surprise to me at all. It was a 
big reason why we were high on 
him.”

Though it’s early, Brown has 

excelled as Michigan’s sixth 
man and justified the decision 
he made over the summer in the 
process.

Behind Brown’s shooting, bench scoring, Wolverines avoid upset bid from Central Florida

Hailey Brown’s experience helping Michigan

Senior forward Hailey Brown 

has been a mainstay for the 
Wolverines ever since she arrived 
in Ann Arbor three years ago. 
With classmates Deja Church 
and Priscilla Smeenge having 
transferred to DePaul and Liberty, 
respectively, Brown is the only one 
left. 

An energetic presence on the 

court known for shot-making 
abilities, Brown’s ability behind 
the arc has impacted Michigan’s 
ability to develop big leads. Last 
season, she led the Wolverines with 
56 3-pointers, going 36.6% from 
beyond the arc.

This season, she has shown the 

ability to be a major contributor, 
scoring 18 points against women’s 
basketball 
powerhouse 
Notre 

Dame, three of which were from 
behind the arc.

The shots came at dire moments 

when 
the 
Wolverines 
were 

searching for the edge. In the first 
half against the Fighting Irish, 
Brown scored 10 points. Coming 
into the second half, she scored a 
clutch three out 
of 
transition, 

giving Michigan 
a 39-34 lead. Her 
final three grew 
the 
Wolverines 

lead to four in 
the third quarter, 
giving her team 
the 
confidence 

to finish Notre 
Dame 
in 
the 

fourth.

“She 
has 
just 
such 
great 

experience and such great feel for 
the game,” Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico said. “That’s what 
makes us a different team this year 
than the team that we were last 
year.”

Brown’s experience comes into 

play this season. She’s just four 
games shy of 100 as a Wolverine, 

and she knows how to play off her 
teammates well and get open for 
shots. 

It’s been a common theme for 

the opposition to have two or three 

players 
shadow 

junior forward Naz 
Hillmon, 
leaving 

Brown wide open. 
And as she’s shown 
this season, Brown 
has the ability to 
make them pay.

“She’s 
a 
kid 

that 
grew 
up 

playing with Team 
Canada,” 
Barnes 

Arico said. “She 

understands the game. Her IQ is 
exceptional. She just knows where 
to be, and she’s a shot maker.” 

Brown’s 
ability 
offensively 

will be a major threat for the 
Wolverines all season, but her 
defensive game speaks for itself. 
The Wolverines blocked eight 
shots against Notre Dame, half of 
them coming from Brown. Last 

season, she averaged 3.3 rebounds 
per game and looks to improve that 
number this year, averaging 4.5 in 
the Wolverines’ first four games. 
Whether it’s her experience as a 
senior or the pieces aligning for 
one last ride at Michigan, Brown 
looks to be extremely valuable for 
the Wolverines offensively and 
defensively. 

The 
Wolverines 
have 
an 

abundance of experience heading 
into Big Ten play. Barnes Arico will 
look towards junior guard Amy Dilk 
to find Brown off the transition and 
knock shots. In the dire moments 
of the game, the Wolverines know 
they can trust Brown.

“We have experience that helps,” 

Barnes Arico said. “We have depth 
that helps and our freshmen are 
going to be outstanding. They’re 
working hard every day. We have 
those key components, we have 
an All-American candidate Naz 
Hillmon, we have a fifth-year 
player and a senior that are pretty 
special.”

Wednesday game off, 
‘M’ schedules Toledo

The 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball 
team’s 
scheduled 

game against NC State for Dec. 
9 has been postponed due to 
COVID-19 concerns within the 
NC State program. The news 
was first reported by Brendan 
Quinn of The Athletic.

“Far 
too 
often 
have 
I 

had to say we are all living 
in 
unprecedented 
times,” 

Michigan coach Juwan Howard 
said in a press release. “Our 
main concern is the health 
and safety of (NC State) coach 
(Kevin) Keatts, his players as 
well as all of 
those 
within 

the N.C. State 
program. It is 
unfortunate 
we 
have 
to 

postpone 
this 

ACC/Big 
Ten 

Challenge 
matchup. 
It 

would 
have 

been 
fun. 

However, 
we must do what is right, and 
this is the right thing to do for 
everyone.”

Quinn additionally reported 

that Michigan will instead 
play Toledo on Dec. 9 at Crisler 
Center, replacing the matchup 
with NC State. Toledo is 3-2 on 
the season so far and expected 
to be one of the top teams in the 

MAC. 

By scheduling a game with 

Toledo, the Wolverines will 
reach 
the 
NCAA-prescribed 

limit of 25 games with five 
non-conference games and a 
20-game conference slate. That 
means the door to playing NC 
State would presumably be 
closed.

The Wolfpack had their game 

against Connecticut, scheduled 
for Saturday, cancelled due to a 
positive test within the NC State 
travelling party at the Mohegan 
Sun Resort. The positive test 
was 
initially 
detected 
on 

Friday after previous rounds 
of negative testing. Michigan 

was 
initially 

scheduled 
to 

play in the multi-
team 
event 
in 

Uncasville, 
Conn. but bowed 
out.

The 

Wolverines were 
slated to battle 
the 
Wolfpack 

as a part of the 
annual 
ACC-

Big Ten Challenge. It’s the 
second contest in the Challenge 
to be cancelled, joining the 
Louisville-Wisconsin 
game 

which was called off due to 
COVID concerns in Louisville’s 
program. 

Michigan said in the release 

that as of now, it has no COVID-
19 issues.

Michigan’s reaction to Ohio State 

game cancelation

Jim Harbaugh protested and 

marched, released statements and 
said publicly at every turn that 
he wanted this football season to 
happen.

And when he told the Michigan 

football team that the biggest 
game of their season was canceled 
— marking the first time in over a 
century that the Wolverines won’t 
play Ohio State — they were just as 
devastated as he was.

“Very disappointed,” Harbaugh 

said. “We were all very much — we 
wanted to play. And we were all 
very much, ‘The odds are against 
us but let’s go do this.’ 

“And as I said before, to a man. 

To a man, our players wanted to 
have that opportunity.”

Kirk Herbstreit’s comments 

on 
ESPN 
last 
week, 
that 

Michigan might “wave the white 
flag” on playing the Buckeyes, 
using COVID-19 as an excuse, 
reverberated around the program. 
Senior defensive back Hunter 
Reynolds angrily tweeted on 
Tuesday, “there wasn’t a person 
in that locker room tryna duck 
anyone,” and athletic director 
Warde Manuel released a scathing 
video 
last 
week 
criticizing 

Herbstreit.

On Tuesday afternoon though, 

all Manuel had was resignation. 
Canceling was the right thing to 
do. That didn’t make it any easier.

“The 
Michigan-Ohio 
State 

game is the greatest rivalry in this 
sport,” Manuel said. “So this is a 
really hard day, hard time, for me, 
for Jim and for our team, our staff, 
our University and for our fans. 
For both teams, I am certain. But 
we had a trend with a number of 
positive tests that continued to go 
up even over the weekend, and so 
over the last seven days, they have 
not slowed. 

“We were not cleared to 

participate in practice by our 
medical staff, and we were looking 
at, in terms of, by the end of week, 

much wouldn’t have changed and 
we still don’t have a total grasp 
of this virus on our team. And so 
we are here today, we made the 
decision this afternoon, that we 
were not going 
to be able to 
participate. 
We 
weren’t 

even cleared to 
practice today.”

No specific 

numbers 
were given in 
terms of the 
Wolverines’ 
COVID-19 
cases. 
Dr. 

Sami Rifat, the 
team’s medical 
director, 
only 

said 
the 
Big 

Ten’s 
red/red 

thresholds — a 
5% 
positivity 

rate 
on 
the 

roster 
and 
a 

7.5% positivity 
rate 
in 
the 

surrounding 
team 
population 
— 

had not been reached. Reports 
earlier in the afternoon said that 
between 
contact 
tracing 
and 

positive cases, the Wolverines 
would have been missing upwards 
of 40 players had the game been 
played.

“Our 
student-athletes 
have 

really worked hard and are 
diligent,” Manuel said. “This is 
probably as much a reflection 
of where we are in our state and 
in our area. … I don’t want any 
of this to be reflective of our 
student-athletes and their efforts 
to really keep themselves and their 
teammates safe.”

A report in the Detroit Free 

Press last week said the outbreak 
came from Thanksgiving-related 
gatherings after the Penn State 
game on Nov. 28. Whether positive 
cases will be stemmed in time 
for Dec. 19, when Michigan is 
scheduled to play a crossover game 

against a to be determined Big Ten 
West opponent, is unclear.

“First priority, as Warde has 

said, (is) stemming the COVID 
positives has been the objective 

here the last week,” Harbaugh 
said. “Still trying to get that under 
control. Hopefully that will be 
looking better in the next few 
days. Ultimately, we were told the 
number of people that were out 
due to COVID was too high. 

“So, there’s the real possibility 

that we could play again before 
this season is over. Our players, as I 
said before, they want to play. They 
wanted to play this week. They 
want to play next week. They’re 
going to continue to condition and 
prepare for that possibility.”

With the state of the schedule 

in flux — Ohio State needs to play 
six games to be eligible for the 
Big Ten championship game next 
week unless the rules are changed 
to accommodate — Manuel said 
Michigan would be open to 
playing the Buckeyes the week of 
Dec. 19 as well if Ohio State doesn’t 
have a sixth game.

ETHAN SEARS
Daily Sports Writer

In 
a 
press 
conference 

dedicated 
primarily 
to 
the 

cancelation of the Ohio State 
game, 
Jim 
Harbaugh 
and 

athletic director Warde Manuel 
declined to speak on rumors of a 
potential contract extension for 
Harbaugh.

Harbaugh’s 
original 
deal 

expires 
in 
2021, 
and 
with 

a dismal 2-4 season so far, 
Michigan is at a crossroads on 
deciding whether to extend 
him or move on. On Monday, 
author John U. Bacon reported 
that Manuel and Harbaugh had 
discussed a new incentive-laden 
contract worth less money than 
his current deal, with a smaller 
buyout. 
Tuesday, 
though, 

Manuel seemingly refuted that.

“This is a time where we’re 

gonna focus on this pandemic,” 
Manuel said. “Jim and I will 
meet, as we have said, at the 
end of the year to discuss the 
program and where we’re gonna 

go and all those different things. 
How rumors get started about 
things before Jim and I sit down 
and have a conversation, I’m not 
gonna get into. That’s not for me 

to track down. 
But 
that’s 

where 
that 

is 
and 
that’s 

where we’ll be 
at the end of 
the season.”

Harbaugh 

added: “Warde 
and I have, for 
months, 
long 

agreed 
that 

we’ll talk about 
the 
extension 

at the end of 
the season.”

When asked 

to clarify what 
was meant by 
the end of the 
season, Manuel 
said, “We have 
one last game 
… that we are 
scheduled 
to 
play,” 

referring 
to 

the 
Championship 
Weekend 

crossover matchup on Dec. 19. 

While it is not a guarantee 

the Wolverines will be able to 
play that weekend given their 
current 
COVID-19 
outbreak, 

Michigan indicated that it is still 
preparing as if it will play that 
game. He also clarified that he 
has always held contract talks at 
the end of the season and that is 
not a new development in 2020.

There would be complications 

from waiting until then to 
further discuss an extension. 
National Signing Day is Dec. 16, 
and if there is uncertainty over 
who will coach the Wolverines 
next year, it could lead to losses 
on the recruiting trail.

When asked if he was afraid 

other teams would use the 
uncertainty around Michigan’s 
coaching situation against it 
in recruiting, Manuel stated 

simply that, “negative recruiting 
occurs all the time.”

Nick Baumgardner of The 

Athletic reported Tuesday that 
Harbaugh and Manuel have 
discussed an extension in the 
last week and that the program 
prefers to have a resolution by 
Signing Day, a date that is in 
conflict with what Manuel said 
in the press conference. Bacon 
and Baumgardner also both 
indicated that Harbaugh has 
received interest from at least 
five NFL teams, though it is 
unclear whether there have been 
any formal job offers. According 
to Baumgardner, the decision is 
now up to Harbaugh to accept 
the new terms or walk away.

Tuesday’s press conference 

didn’t clear anything up on 
the contract front — in fact, it 
made things seem even more 
uncertain. Whatever happens, 
though, it’s likely that a decision 
will come in the next few weeks, 
whether that’s before Signing 
Day 
or 
after 
Championship 

Weekend. We just likely won’t 
know what’s coming until it 
happens.

“I don’t wanna make anybody 

feel or think that Jim and I 
have been just sitting around, 
not talking to each other about 
this,” Manuel said. “We have 
had a lot to talk about ... and 
Jim has been a leader and 
phenomenal with his efforts 
on his team. ... He’s committed 
to this team, he’s committed to 
this department, he’s committed 
to this university. 

“So from my standpoint, he 

has been doing everything at a 
high level, including his efforts 
with the team, so from that 
perspective I just don’t want 
people to get the sense that 
we’re just sitting around and 
nobody’s talking to each other 
and we’re waiting and waiting. 
That is the furthest thing from 
the truth. We’ve had a lot to do 
and a lot of other things to talk 
about.”

Harbaugh, Manuel mum on contract 

extension talks

What would have been: Even before cancellation, 

COVID-19 took the life out of “The Game”

O

n Monday morning 
of the week Michi-
gan was scheduled 
to play Ohio State, 

there wasn’t an unruly mess 
of TV cameras swarming Jim 
Harbaugh’s press conference. 
Even in this 
Zoom year, 
there weren’t 
four screens 
of reporters 
pining for 
that perfect 
soundbyte.

On Twitter, 

there weren’t 
fans perform-
ing the req-
uisite mental 
gymnastics to convince them-
selves that this is the year the 
Wolverines finally win. There 
weren’t players saying they came 
to Michigan to beat Ohio State 
or seniors praying their last shot 
comes to fruition.

The reason, of course, was a 

COVID-19 outbreak in the Michi-
gan program put in-person prac-
tices on pause since last Monday, 
ultimately forcing The Game to 
be canceled on Tuesday.

“It is disheartening that we’re 

not gonna be able to play Mary-
land,” athletic director Warde 
Manuel said last week in a video 
released to media. “And our hope 
is that we can play Ohio State 
and finish the season in the final 
week.”

On Tuesday, his hopes were 

officially squashed.

Consider that for a second and 

let it sink in. For the first time in 
103 years, Michigan will not play 
Ohio State. The last time it hap-
pened, there was the small mat-
ter of a World War. A year later, 

despite the Spanish flu pandemic 
limiting the Wolverines to five 
games, the two teams faced off at 
Ohio Field, with Michigan win-
ning, 14-0.

Let’s not have any misconcep-

tions: That result would have 
been incredibly unlikely to hap-
pen this year, even if The Game 
were played. As of Sunday night, 
the Buckeyes were favored by 
29.5 — a fair line considering one 
team is bound for the College 
Football Playoff and the other 
is 2-4.

But despite this horrendous 

year for Harbaugh and Michigan, 
there’s something inconceivable 
about The Game being canceled.

From a purely fact-based 

analysis of the rivalry’s last 15 
years, a cancelation would seem 
to be no great loss. Since 2004, 
the Wolverines have won just 
once. Under Harbaugh, Michigan 
is 0-5. For nearly two decades, 
it hasn’t mattered whether the 
Wolverines are a national title 
contender or bottom-feeding fod-
der. They do nothing but alter-
nate losses in Columbus with 
losses in Ann Arbor.

And yet, there’s something 

impossibly hopeful about The 
Game. Think about the age-old 
debate amongst fans: Would 
Michigan rather finish 11-1 with 
a loss to Ohio State or 1-11 with 

a win over Ohio State? As fool-
ish as the question is (and yes, 
11-1 is the answer), it highlights 

the meaning of this game. A few 
lucky bounces and questionable 
calls can reverse a season’s last-
ing feeling.

Consider, for example, the 

Buckeyes’ 2018 upset of Michi-
gan. Ranked 10th in the country, 
they weren’t going to the Col-
lege Football Playoff. By their 
sky-high standards, the season 
should have already been a dis-
appointment. But they spoiled 
the Wolverines’ Revenge Tour 
party. That, not its eventual Rose 
Bowl win, is Ohio State’s lasting 
impression of its 2018 season.

And if you think the same 

can’t happen for Michigan, think 
back a year further. With three 

losses before The Game and John 
O’Korn under center, the Wol-
verines were 12-point underdogs 
and had precious little to play 
for. Yet, they scored the game’s 
first 14 points, and led mid-
way through the third quarter. 
Had Josh Metellus held onto a 
dropped second-quarter inter-
ception, Michigan likely would 
have won.

Do I think that would have 

happened this year if The Game 
were played? No. If I had to pick 
one side of Vegas’ 29.5-point 
spread, it would’ve been the 
Buckeyes’. But for this one week, 
hope would have at least ema-
nated.

“We still have the big team, 

OSU, at the end of the year,” 
senior offensive lineman Andrew 
Stueber said, when asked what 
Michigan had left to play for 
after a 27-17 loss to Penn State 
dropped the Wolverines to 2-4. 
“We just need to click on all cyl-
inders and we’re in contention 
for that game.”

Call that a fairy tale impres-

sion of Michigan’s chances. I 
won’t blame you, because I agree. 
But the pure presence of that 
word — chance — mattered. It 
mattered to these players and it 
mattered to Harbaugh.

And if nothing else positive 

could have come out of this 
wretched year, they deserved 
those five days of annual opti-
mism. It might have been all they 
had.

The Michigan Wolverines lines up on defense against the Ohio State Buckeyes in last year’s edition of “The Game” which the Wolverines lost, 27-56.

‘THE GAME’ CANCELED

 ALEC COHEN/Daily

With COVID-19 cases on the rise within the program, the Michigan-Ohio State matchup became the 121st FBS game 
to be canceled this season.


It’s not how you start, it’s how you finish.

That refrain certainly rang true for the 

Michigan men’s basketball team (4-0) during 

Sunday’s 80-58 rout of Central Florida (1-1). 

After surviving three tune-up games against 

low mid-major opponents, the Wolverines 

came out flat against the Knights, who had 

beaten Auburn in their only game of the season. 

Not only was Michigan’s defense incapable of 

preventing UCF’s guards from getting to the 

rim, but it struggled to crack the Knights’ 2-3 

zone as well. Midway through the first half, UCF 

had built a double-digit lead off mainly layups. 

The Wolverines’ inability to hit perimeter shots 

worsened their early frustrations. 

“I can tell you it was frustrating just to see the 

amount of shots they were making coming off 

ball screens,” Michigan coach Juwan Howard 

said. “(We) had to make some adjustments with 

our ball-screen coverage. ... There were some 

opportunities where they had some direct blow-

by drives, when they were touching the paint too 

many times.”

The introduction of freshman duo Hunter 

Dickinson and Terrance Williams — at center 

and forward, respectively — changed the tide, 

sparking a 25-9 run from the 9:29 mark on. 

Thanks to their combined 16-point, six-rebound 

contribution in the first half, a rejuvenated 

Michigan took a 38-34 lead into the break. 

“We have confidence in the second unit, of 

course,” Dickinson said. “We’re five guys who 

are very confident in ourselves. We know that 

when we go out there we can make an impact 

on the floor. We know we need the leadership 

from the first unit to help us out, but we’re also 

capable of making our own sparks coming in off 

the bench.”

The Wolverines’ newfound energy persisted 

into the second half as two driving buckets from 

sophomore wing Franz Wagner and a corner 

three from senior guard Eli Brooks increased 

their advantage to 10. 

Defensively, Michigan also cleaned up its act 

in the second half. The Wolverines stayed in 

front of the Knights and forced them into taking 

jumpers rather than layups, which they had 

failed to do in the early going. 

Despite senior forward Isaiah Livers, who 

entered the game as Michigan’s leading scorer, 

being held scoreless through the first 33 minutes, 

Michigan’s lead continued to balloon. Senior 

guard Chaundee Brown has compiled some 

up-and-down shooting performances to start 

the season — going 5-for-7 against Bowling 

Green and then 1-for-10 from deep against 

Oakland — but he caught fire in the second half. 

In a four-minute span, Brown knocked down 

three of his four 3-pointers on the day to put the 

game firmly out of reach. 

“I realize that, playing this game for years, 

you’re not gonna have a good shooting night 

every night,” Brown said. “It’s the life of a 

shooter. But coach Howard told me just to keep 

shooting, keep shooting, keep shooting. Just 

having that confidence from a coach like that 

makes me stay aggressive and confident. I know 

I have a nice shot, they know I have a nice shot, 

I’ve been working all summer and all fall on it.”

In the end, it wasn’t close. Behind 47 

points from its bench — led by Brown’s 18 and 

Dickinson’s 14 — the Wolverines overcame a 

sluggish start in dominant fashion. With one 

game remaining before Big Ten play starts, 

Michigan’s schedule will only increase in 

difficulty, and it will have to rely on the very 

same depth that spurred Sunday’s comeback. 

“We have a very deep team,” Howard said. 

“Our thing is all hands on deck. And game by 

game, it’s always being evaluated on what’s 

giving us the best chance. But we’re gonna need 

everyone this season, it’s that simple.”
