FINANCING YOUR EDUCATION
Congress adds
to Pell Grants

QB Threet to transfer

More than 3,000
University students
benefit from federal
scholarship program
ByBENJAMIN S. CHASE
Daily StaffReporter
Much of the attention surround-
ing the federal economic stimulus
package has focused on the benefit
it will provide for large, struggling
institutions, like national banks
and domestic automakers.
However, the effects of the stim-
p ulus package could soon be felt by
thousands of students here at the
University.
When Congress passed Presi-
dent Barack Obama's $787 billion
American Recovery and Reinvest-
ment Act on Friday, the Federal
Pell Grant Program -federally
funded scholarships for students
with demonstrated financial need
- received a significant boost in
funding.
For the 2007-2008 academic
year, 3,349 University students
received Pell Grants, totaling over
$9 million in aid with each student
receiving an average of $2,776,
according to Margaret Rodriguez,
senior associate director of the

Office of Financial Aid.
The bill proposes changes to
the program that could increase
both the number of students who
receive grants and the amount of
money students receive.
The federal government grants
between 5 and 6 million scholar-
ships through the Pell Grant pro-
gram each year. That number, and
the number of applicants for the
grants, has increased every year
since 2005, according to the U.S.
Department of Education.
Federal funding for the Pell
Grant program has fluctuated over
the past several years, from $12.35
billion in 2005 to $17.34 billion in
2006, according to the U.S. Depart-
ment of Education. In 2008, fund-
ing for grants was $16.26 billion.
The increases in funding per
grant are modest under the bill.
But, the bill includes provisions
for more substantial increases the
future.
Calling for an additional $13.869
billion to be allocated for Pell
Grants in the 2009 and 2010 fiscal
years, the stimulus package will
permit an increase of $281 in indi-
vidual grant money for 2009-2010
and $400 for 2010-2011.
Additionally, the bill will
increase the maximum amount for
individual grants to $5,012. The

Redshirt freshman quarterback
Steven Threet will transfer from
Michigan, according to a state-
ment released early this morning.

"I have decided to transfer
from the University of Michigan,"
Threet wrote in the statement. "I
have requested and received my
release.I do not yet know where I
will continue my collegiate career,
and have no further comment until
that decision is made."
Calls to StevenThreet's cell phone
last night from The Michigan Daily
were not returned. When contacted
last night by the Daily, Threet's
father, Jewel Threet, said his son
would release astatementtoday and
declined further comment.

AnAthletic Departmentspokes-
person also declined to comment
about the statement.
TheWolverines'starterin8-of-12
games last year, Threet transferred
from Georgia Tech prior to the 2007
season. He finished last season 102-
of-200 for 1,105 yards, nine touch-
downs and seven interceptions.
Michigan signed two quarter-
backs, Tate Forcier and Denard
Robinson, on National Signing
Day on Feb. 5. Forcier, a four-star
recruit according to rivals.com,
enrolled early in January and will

practice with the team this spring.
Redshirt sophomores Nick
Sheridan and David Cone are the
only returning quarterbacks on
Michigan's roster. Sheridan start-
ed four games last season. Fresh-
man Justin Feagin, who began last
season at quarterback and moved
to slot receiver, will also return.
Phil Jacobs, Threet's coach at
Adrian High School, said yester-
day he didn't know about Threet's
plan to transfer.

Education 222 looks
at role of videogames
in education
By JOHN A. WEISS, JR.
Daily StaffReporter
Staring at a flat-screen televi-
sion, Nintendo 64 controller in
hand, ignoring piles of schoolwork
and replacing it with nine straight
hours of Super Smash Bros., may
not actually be a complete waste of
time.
Thanks to Education 222: Vid-
eogames & Learning, a new class
offered by the School of Education
this winter semester, video game
enthusiasts will now be able to do
homework and play their favorite

game at the same time.
Barry Fishman, associate pro-
fessor of Educational Studies and
Information Sciences, said he start-
ed the class as a way to change how
people view videogames, to help
them understand that they can be
used for more than just late-night
fun.
"The objectives (of the class)
are to give people a different way
to think about videogames, about
learning and about schools," Fish-
man said.
Fishman said videogames are
built off of a rewards system, the
ability to "die" and start a level
again without penalization. This
keeps a player committed to play-
ing, to get to the next level and
eventually beat a game.

Officers rope off part of the fourth floor of Van Duren house in Bursley Hall late Friday night after flooding caused damage tothe hallway and nearby rooms.
Flood causes damage to Bursley

Nearly three dozen
students displaced
from rooms after
sprinkler goes off
By LINDSAY KRAMER
Daily StaffReporter
The third and fourth floors of
the Van Duren House in Bursley
Hall are littered with industrial
fans and lined with caution tape,
the lone remains of a flood that
left roughly three dozen students

without a place to stay late Friday
night.
University Housing spokesman
Peter Logan said the fans are being
used to help soak up the water left
by a damaged sprinkler in one of
the roomson the fourth floor.
Nearly all students displaced
by the flood could return to their
room early Saturday morning,
Logan said, with just the residents
of the two rooms directly connect-
ed to the sprinkler that started the
flood left in temporary housing.
Logan said their rooms should be
ready this week. .
Significant portions of the hall-

ways affected by the water are still
taped off, leavinglimited access to
the 18 damaged rooms.
Around 9:30 p.m. Friday night,
a sprinkler in a room on the fourth
floor of the Van Duren House went
off, flooding the east wings of the
third and fourth floors. The sprin-
klers triggered the fire alarms
throughout the building, and stu-
dents were forced to evacuate.
"It was like brown water every-
where," LSA freshman Anne Ber-
renberger said. "It flooded the
hallway and came into (our) room
through the door."
Berrenberger lives in the room

directly connected to the room
where the flood started, and said
she won't be allowed back into
Bursley until Tuesday.
Berrenberger's roommate, LSA
freshman Jenny Nowierski, said
they have both been staying in a
friend's room since Friday.
All of the residents whoseroons
were not affected by the water
returned to their rooms within a
half hour. Those in the affected
hallways returned to their rooms
around 12:30 a.m. to collect some
of their belongings, but were
advised not to sleep there.

Vlcek passed away
after car accident on
way to work Tuesday
By EMILY ORLEY and
STEPHANIE STEINBERG
Daily Staff Reporters
Yesterday afternoon, mem-
bers of the University community
gathered to honor the life of Faith
Vlcek, a program administrator
in the Ford School of Public Pol-
icy who was killed in a car acci-
dent on her way to work early last
Tuesday.
A memorial service was held at

the Manchester United Methodist
Church, as friends and colleagues
paid their respects to Vlcek, who
worked at the Ford's School Inter-
national Policy Center.
Colleagues remember Vlcek for
her kind spirit, helping hand and
the great impact she had on the
lives of those whso krnew her during
the 10 years she spenut working at
the University.
"She was the hseart and soul of
every place I worked," said Jan
Svejnar, director of the Interna-
tional Policy Center.
Vleek first came to the Universi-
ty to work at the William Davidson
Institute as an executive assistant.
In 2004, she moved to the Faculty

Support group at the Ross School
of Business. She later joined the
Ford School in 2007.
While Vlcek's main responsi-
bilities were to make travel and
event arrangements, Svejnar said
she always went well beyond what
was asked.
"Professorn woculd visit fromru all

British colleges see application jump

SING ALONG STARS

Faced with dim prospects in
an ever increasingly weak job
market, many British students
have made the decision to
attend college, the Chronicle
of Higher Education reported.
Applications to Universities
in Great Britain are up 8 per-
cent, with a huge influx of that
coming between December
and January.
Applications coming from
students older than 24 greatly
contributed to the spike in
applications, with a 12.6 per-
cent increase despite the fact
that financial aid for adults
has been decreased in recent
years.
NORTHERN ILLINOIS U.
UNVEILS MEMORIAL TO
FIVE STUDENTS KILLED
LAST YEAR
A year after five students

were shot and killed in Cole
Hall at Northern Illinois Uni-
versity, the school announced
plans to create a memorial gar-
den to honor the students, the
Chronicle of Higher Education
reported.
The garden, which will be
constructed east of the build-
ing, will feature five illumi-
nated red-granite panels, each
bearing the name of one of the
victims.
The final design for the gar-
den was chosen from an ini-
tial batch of 200 suggestions
reviewed by a university com-
mittee.
FORMER STUDENTS SUE
EAST STROUDSBURG U. OF
PENNSYLVANIA
One current student and
five former students sued
East Stroudsburg University

of Pennsylvania on Friday,
alleging the university did not
properly investigate a former
vice president who allegedly
made blatant sexual advancesy
toward male students, the
Chronicle of Higher Education
reported.
The suit seeks more than
$50,000 for damages, claiming
Isaac W. Sanders used schol-
arships to get close to young
African-American students
before he then made advances
on them.
"These were boys who were
preyed upon because of the
fact they were from single-
parent households, they were
looking for mentorship. That's
one of the things that hurts the
most," Albert R. Murray Jr., a
lawyer for the plaintiffs told
the Associated Press.

MIDLAND, Mich.
Dow Chemical
plans to sell solar
shingles by 2011
Dow Chemical Co. says it aims to
start selling power-generating roof
shingles by 2011.
The Midland-based chemical
giant has been at work for the past
year on a $50 million project called
Dow Solar Solutions.
The company's scientists and
engineers are working to develop a
product to sell thermoplastic solar
roof shingles throughout North
America.
Dow Chemical is collaborating
with three home builders - Len-
nar Corp. of Miami, Pulte Homes
Inc. of Bloomfield Hills and Prost
Builders Inc. of Jefferson City, Mo.
- and with Tucson, Ariz.-based
Global Solar Energy Inc., a maker
of flexible materials.
The researchers have conduct-
ed numerous tests in preparing
the shingles for market, said Rob-
ert J. Cleereman, senior director
of solar development for Dow
Chemical.
"We've thrown everything you
can imagine at them from (simu-
lated) hail to fire to see how they
react," he told The Saginaw News.
"One day, a person would no more
think about buying a house without
solar shingles than they would buy
a house without plumbing. That is
our hope, at least."

Peanut growers feel
effects of outbreak
With hundreds of thousands
of Americans out of work and the
economy in a nosedive, the U.S.
peanut industry expected sales to
soar this year.
Americans tend to turn to peanut
products to stretch their food dol-
lars in tough times, avoiding more
expensive protein sources such as
steak and ground beef.
Enter an ongoing salmonella out-
break that has'sickened some 600
people in 43 states and been linked
to nine deaths, and those rosy pre-
dictions after a record growing sea-
son have been dashed.
"They've tainted our entire
industry," said Shelly Nutt, execu-
tive director of the peanut produc-
ers board in Texas, the nation's
second largest growing state
behind Georgia. "Public perception
is killing us."
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich.
Northwest plane
diverted, smoke

A commuter plane operated by
Northwest Airlines was diverted to
Gerald R. Ford International Air-
port after the pilot reported smoke
in the cockpit.
Flight 2125, a Northwest Air-
link flight operated by Northwest
subsidiary Pinnacle Aviation, had
taken off from Minneapolis and
was headed for Cleveland when

it landed in Grand Rapids about 6
p.m. Sunday.
The 39 passengers were immedi-
ately transferred to another flight
to continue on to Cleveland.
Airport spokesman Phil Johnson
tells The Grand Rapids Press that
the airport experiences "a number
of diversions throughout the year."
The plane was being inspected to
determine the source of the smoke.
A message was left with Northwest
media representatives.
LANSING, Mich.
Analysis: Granholm
has tough path to
fix prison system
Gov. Jennifer Granholm's
ambitious plan to save money
by releasing more prisoners is
doable, but a lot has to go right
for it to work.
Since the number of inmates
exceeded 51,000 almost two years
ago, her administration has low-
ered the population to just over
48,000 through paroles and com-
mutations, a timely drop in felony
convictions and prison intakes, and
an expanded program that aims
to keep parolees from committing
new crimes.
The trend certainly could contin-
ue, but the Michigan Department
of Corrections has a tough path
ahead to reach its goal of reduc-
ing the head count an additional
7 percent by year's end. The last
time Michigan was under 45,000
inmates: 1999.

University holds its first
Bean Chili Cook-off

Competitors ranged
from rookies to
veteran chili cooks
By SAGAR DESHPANDE
For the Daily
Last Friday, the East Quad caf-
eteria took on a distinctly south-
western flair, becoming the site
for the Residential Dining Ser-
vices Bean Chili Cook-off.
The competitors included
eight dining services employees,
including two students. Several
contestants brought decades of
chili cooking experience to the
competition, and others were
cooking chili for the first time in
their lives.
The contestants were ranked
on their chili dishes by both a
panel ofthree judges and by popu-
lar vote. The dishes were required
to be made from blends of beans
grown in Michigan.
West Quad Kitchen Cleaner
Meena Bajrachanya, a 10-year
chili veteran, took home the
judges' gold with her Himalayan
Spicy Chili, an exotic vegetarian
blend of kidney beans, onions,
green and red peppers and many
spices.
Bajrachanya said she brought

the recipe with her from her
homeland of Nepal.
Joyua Williams, a cook from
Bursley Hall, took home the
"crowd favorite" prize with her
New Orleans Chumbo.
Another 10-year veteran of the
trade, Williams said her recipe
was a personal creation loaded
with hamburger, Italian sausage,
andouille sausage and shrimp.
LSA freshman Annemarie
Friedo said Williams's dish was
one of her favorites.
"A lot of the other chili was
really good," Friedo said, "but
most were too different from tra-
ditional chili to be called chili."
LSA freshman Maddie Con-
way, Friedo's friend and self-
proclaimed chili connoisseur,
completely disagreed.
"The Himalayan didn't look
like a traditional chili, but tasted
like one," she said. Conway also
said that she and her father have
participated in many soup and
chili competitions, adding valid-
ity to her sentiments.
Like many other competitions,
this one wasn't without its share
of underhanded tactics.
"Mysupervisorlied to me,"said
Engineering sophomore and East
Quad server Mischa Veenhuysen.
"I thought I was signing up to be
a judge, and then all of a sudden I

was asked to come up with some
chili."
Veenhuysen said he got the
recipe for his "South of the Diag"
chili from a friend, which he said
he "added a couple of things to."
"It kind of turned out as a bean
dip," he said, "but it still came out
well."
Most in attendance agreed that
the chili cook-off was a welcome
break from the monotony of regu-
lar cafeteria food.
"I think this really helps, it gets
us outofthe mundane," said Engi-
neering sophomore Jack Linkous.
Many students expressed a
desire for other similar events.
"It would be really cool if they
could havea pie-making competi-
tion," Friedo said.
LSA sophomore Rose Partirich
agreed, saying she would "like to
see a cookie or cupcake competi-
tion."
Residential Dining Services is
having a salad competition over
spring break, on Feb. 26th, in
Bursley Hall.
Steve Meyers, executive chef
for Dining Services, said the chili
cook-off could possibly become
an annual event, a popular idea
among students.
"It would be really sweet if
they could do this again," Conway
said.

Illinois Senator Burris rebuffs
calls for him to give up his seat

Affidavit contradicts
earlier statements
made by senator
CHICAGO (AP) - Just as Illi-
nois was moving past the agony
and embarrassment offormer Gov.
Rod Blagojevich's ousting, the fel-
low Democrat whom Blagojevich
appointed to the U.S. Senate was
hearing calls for his own resigna-
tion yesterday amid allegations he
lied to legislators.
Freshman Sen. Roland Burris
released an affidavit on Saturday
that contradicts his statements
last month to a House commit-
tee investigating Blagojevich's
impeachment.
"I can't believe anything that
comes out of Mr. Burris at this
point," Rep. Jim Durkin, the
impeachment committee's rank-
ing Republican, said at a news
conference Sunday. "I think it
would be in the best interest of
the state if he resigned because
I don't think the state can stand
this anymore."
But an adamant and sometimes
emotional Burris told reporters
later Sunday that he hadn't done
anything wrong and never misled
anyone.
"I've always conducted myself
with honor and integrity," he said.
"At no time did I ever make any
inconsistent statement."
Gov. Pat Quinn, who advanced
to the governor's mansion after
Blagojevich was ousted over cor-

ruption allegations last month,
also called on Burris to explain
the contradiction.
"My opinion is that he owes
the people of Illinois a complete
explanation," Quinn said, accord-
ing to spokesman Bob Reed.
Durkin and House Republican
Leader Tom Cross also want an
investigation of Burris for pos-
sible perjury.
It's not clear what action state
legislators could now take against
Burris, said Dawn Clark Netsch,
a Northwestern University law
professor and former Illinois
Comptroller.
"I'm not aware that anything
quite like this has happened in
any state before," she said.
Based on federal law, the state
Senate could argue that Burris
was a temporary appointment,
then pass a bill calling for a spe-
cial election to name a permanent
senator, Netsch said.
But Quinn's hands may be tied.
"I don't see anything that the
current governor could do, except
to ask for legislation to ask for a
special election," Netsch said.
Saturday's disclosure by Bur-
ris reflects a major omission from
his testimony in January when
an Illinois House impeachment
committee specifically asked if
he had ever spoken to Robert
Blagojevich or other aides to the
now-deposed governor about the
seat vacated by President Barack
Obama.
"Clearly, it would have been
better if Senator Burris had pro-

vided this information when he
first testified," said Jim Manley, a
spokesman for U.S. Senate Major-
ity Leader Harry Reid, who was
among the Democrats who only
consented to seat Burris on the
belief that there was no chance of
"pay for play" politics surround-
ing Burris' appointment.,
He said Reid "is reviewing the
affidavit and will await any action
by Illinois legislative leaders after
they review the matter."
Manley and Christina Anga-
rola, a spokeswoman for Illinois
Sen. Dick Durbin, both said Sun-
day that Burris informed the
senators of the affidavit on Friday,
but Angarola said Burris didn't
provide a copy.
But Burris explained Sun-
day that he voluntarily gave the
committee a Feb. 4 affidavit dis-
closing the contact with Robert
Blagojevich because question-
ing during his January testi-
mony abruptly changed course
and he never got a chance to
answer a direct question about
Blagojevich's brother.
Transcripts of Burris' tes-
timony, however, show he had
opportunities to provide a full
response to Illinois legislators.
In one instance, when asked
directly about speaking to Robert
Blagojevich and other associates
of the former governor, Burris
consulted withhis attorney before
responding.

President forgoes
'car czar,' will
instead form senior
group of advisors
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi-
dent Barack Obama plans to appoint
senior administration officials -
rather than a single "car czar," as
had been discussed - to oversee a
restructuring of the auto industry.
Treasury Secretary Timothy Gei-
thner and National Economic Coun-
cil Director Lawrence Summers will
oversee the across-the-government
panel, a senior administration offi-
cial said yesterday on the condition
of anonymity because no announce-
ment had been made.
"The president understands the,
importance of this issue and also
understands that the auto industry
affects and is affected by a broad
range of economic policies," the
official said.
As the teams move forward,
Obama "wants to make sure that
we're getting the expertise and
input of agencies across the govern-
ment," the official said.
Obama and his aides face diffi-
cult choices on the fate of the U.S.
auto industry, weighing the cost of
pouring billions more into strug-
gling companies against possible
bankruptcies that could undermine
plans to jump-start the economy.
General Motors Corp. and
Chrysler LLC are racing against a
Tuesday deadline to submit plans
to the government. The plans are
to be followed by weeks of intense
negotiations ahead of a March 31

deadline for the final versions of
the reports.
GM and Chrysler are living off a
combined $13.4 billion in govern-
ment loans. If they don't receive
concessions by March 31, they face
the prospect of having the loans
pulled, followed by bankruptcy
proceedings.
Any bankruptcy would be par-
ticularly painful, with some econo-
mists predicting the country could
lose 2 million to 3 million jobs this
year and the unemployment rate,
now 7.6 percent, could swell past 9
percent by the spring of 2010.
In television interviews Sunday,
White House senior adviser David
Axelrod didn't respond directly
when asked if the U.S. economy
could withstand a GM bankruptcy.
Nor did he directly address a ques-
tion about whether the-Obama
administration would let GM go
into bankruptcy.
"I'm not going to prejudge any-
thing. I think that there is going to
have to be a restructuring of those
companies. I'm not going to get
into the mode of how that happens.
We'll wait and see what they have
to say on Tuesday," he told "Fox
News Sunday."
Executives at the two automak-
ers have said bankruptcy is not an
option because consumers would
not buy cars from a company that
might go out ot business.
"How that .restructuring comes
is something that has to be deter-
mined," Axelrod said. "But it's
going to be something that's going
to require sacrifice not just from the
auto workers but also from credi-
tors, from shareholders and the
executives who run the company."

The name game
MSA, LSA-SG should focus on issues instead of labels
Student governments at the University have been getting a lot
of attention so far this year, and not because of any impressive
accomplishments. Instead it has been the unnecessary reso-
lutions, disturbing inaction and party politics that have captured the
student body's interest. The collapse of student government's domi-
nant party, the Michigan Action Party, and a controversial attempt
by the LSA Student Government to drop party labels from the bal-
lot, are certainly reflections of this negative attention. But while
these changes may represent the slightest of improvements to stu-
dent government's approach, dropping party labels isn't the change
it needs. Instead, MSA and LSA-SG need to change their definition
of parties into an entity that actually works for students.

It started as a crazy love poem in food
dedicated to an amazing candidate:'
- Zilly Rosen, a pastry artist in Buffalo, on her mural of President Barack Obama and former President
Abe Lincoln composed completely of cupcakes, as reported yesterday by The New York Times.

Schooling Granholm

The Michigan Action Party has swept
the past two elections with campaign
promises that are left unfulfilled and get
MSA and LSA-SG nowhere. The party has
been an election-winning machine because
of its ability to rally around one cause: get-
ting re-elected. Sadly, it has failed to act in
the best interest of students, instead func-
tioning only as a tool to get a select group
of students into LSA-SG and MSA.
Early last week, MAP split into two dif-
ferent groups - the Michigan vision Party
and the reMICHIGAN Campaign, which
doesn't want to be thought of as a party. On
top of that, LSA-SG decided to go party-
free this election - at least in principle,
since the LSA-SG bylaws require that can-
didates be allowed to identify with a party
on the ballot. Getting rid of parties is cur-
rently all the rage.
But just because these organizations
don't want to be classified as parties
doesn't mean anything has really changed.
Whether they call themselves parties, cam-
paigns,-groups-or-anything else, student
governments need to form entities that
have greater concerns than getting elect-
ed. The name doesn't matter - what mat-
ters is that representatives come together,
to work toward a common goal of meeting
student's specific needs. Student govern-
ment leaders, whether they form new par-

ties or shed the label of party altogether,
must keep in mind that their groups should
be based around the idea of policymakers
working together to help their constitu-
ents. A "party" should have a policy agenda
that aims to better the University.
Ideally, parties are a proven way for a
group of candidates with a similar mes-
sage to work together and articulate their
goals. And if there were more than one
legitimate, constructive party in the run-
ning, actual competition might drive voter
turnout - or at least turnout that's better
than 9 percent (the abysmal percentage).
Higher voter turnout could even result in a
measure of accountability for these parties.
Restoring student government's account-
ability should be a central concern of any
new group in MSA or LSA-SG, and party
labels should exist to accomplish this goal.
An effective student government would
achieve real policy changes, create effec-
tive political parties and build a system of
accountability. If this happens, students
could see their elected officials actually,
get things done. MAP certainly wasn't the
first group in student government to mis-
interpret the word "party" as a club to get
people elected - and it probably won't be
the last - but with its dissolution comes an
opportunity for MSA and LSA-SG leaders
to have parties the right way.

cation budget proposal, Gov.
Jennifer Gra-
nholm proposed a

cut to state univer-
sities.
paragraph, play-
ing the world's
smallest violin,
she beseeched PATRICK
colleges to freeze
their tuition rates O'MAHEN
in light of "dif-
ficult economic
times" for students and families.
Apparently Granholm's bargain for
universities is "Don't raise tuition and,
in exchange, we'll cut your aid." I sup-
pose she also expects universities to
maintain their quality of instruction
and research, too.
Governor, I want a unicorn, but that
doesn't mean Ican get one.
Aside from state officials' impos-
sible dreams, historical analysis shows
something more pernicious at work.
Instead of making reasonable appro-
priations to support higher education,
Michigan has quietly shifted the cost
of higher education from the state to
students.
Using data from the University's
Office of Budget, I calculated the per-
centages of the University system's
general fund revenues provided by
state funding and tuition since the turn
of the century. In 2001-02, tuition dol-
lars made up 54 percent of general fund
revenues. This school year, they make
up 64 percent. In contrast, the state's
contribution to the University has
slipped from 34 percent to 24 percent.
These trends do not reflect runaway
spending increases at the University;
they reflect reductions in Lansing's

contribution.
Adjustingfundingtotals forinflation
with data from the Bureau of Labor
Statistics makes the picture bleaker.
To put it in starker terms, the governor
has proposed $362.1 million in funding
to the University system in 2009-10. If
state funding kept up with inflation,
the system would get $511.3 million.
Undergraduates and their families will
have to pay higher tuition to bridge that
$149.2 million gap.
No matter how the numbers get
sliced, they demonstrate the whole-
sale gutting of higher education fund-
ing during the last decade. The state of
Michigan has abdicated its responsi-
bility to make a good college education
accessible to all residents who have the
talent for it.
In calling for a tuition freeze, Gra-
nholm cynically hopes to shift respon-
sibility and outrage for the state's own
shortcomings to state universities to
raise tuition.
But the numbers don't lie. Politicians
do - and we're paying for it.
So Michigan Student Assembly
President Sabrina Shingwani, what are
you goingto do about this?
What about you, LSA Student Gov-
ernment President Leslie Zaikis?
And all the rest of you, elected offi-
cials in student government?
I'm calling you all out. Despite pop-
ular opinion, I know you're intelligent
and hard-working and you care about
us. Here's an issue to mobilize your
constituents. Here's your chance to
make a real difference in student gov-
ernment.
And you, Nathanial Eli Coats Styer
over at the University's chapter of the
College Democrats - I'm calling you
and your organization out. You regis-
tered 4,700 voters last fall. I challenge
you to get 4,700 signatures on a peti-
tion to Lansing.

And what about all of us at the
Graduate Employees Organization?
Last year, we stood up for ourselves
and won a great contract. Now we have
a chance to stand up for our students.
So Solidarity Committee Chair Shana
Greenstein, let's get to work.
We need to pass resolutions, cir-
culate petitions and call lawmakers
to apply pressure. We need to orga-
nize our constituents and members
and encourage them to make a differ-
ence. But most of all, we need to work
together and coordinate our activities.
Together, we speak much louder than
we do as individuals.

Students leaders
need to defend
higher education.

4

Finally, we need to contact our sister
organizations at every other state uni-
versity - from Michigan State Univer-
sity to Grand Valley State University.
When 100 students from Ann Arbor
show up at the capital, no one cares.
But if 10,000 students from all over
Michigan march on Lansing, lawmak-
ers might wake up.
So man the phone banks. Fire up
the word processors. Knock on some
doors. Light the torches. Sharpen the
pitchforks. Let's tell state lawmakers
exactly what to do with Granholm's
higher education budget proposal -
loudly and often.
And for once, let's organize as a com-
munity and stick up for ourselves.

As the Michigan Student Assembly examines its future on campus,
the Daily would like students to voice their opinions
on what should be a part of its agenda.

BRIA GRAY AND ALEX LEVY IEWPOINT
What Israel's election means

What's your vision?
It's a simple question, really. Think back,
whether it be a few months or a few years, to
the moment you first became a student at the
University of Michigan. What were your expec-
tations, not only of college in general but of the
University of Michigan? What did you hope
this school would offer you, and what did you
hope you could offer this school?
We are a campus of activists when we choose
to be. From Dance Marathon to Detroit Part-
nership to Circle K and beyond, students are
involved in many service organizations com-
mitted to making our university community
and society a better place. Yet year after year,
the Michigan Student Assembly, the very orga-
nization that is supposed to serve our needs and
interests, falls short. But rather than acquiesce
to this embedded notion of failure, we firmly
believe that MSA has the ability to represent
our school's best.
If you are reading this, you likely have
noticed the recent number of students on this
page railing against what they see as an inef-
fective governing body. Chances are that many
of you gave up on student government long ago,
convinced of its uselessness. Instead, you chose
to devote your time to an organization with
more tangible, effective results.
Today, we ask you to re-enter the fold. We
ask you not to consider what student govern-
ment has been, but what it could be. Today, we
ask you to help us create a new vision for MSA,
with a new set of transparent, tangible goals to
help make up for all the discontentment. Today,
we ask you to help create a Michigan vision.
The Michigan Vision Party does not exist to
serve as a sounding board for a small group of
students, but rather, as a medium for the entire
student body. We have already set up an e-mail
address, whatsyourvision@umich.edu. Send us a
note. Tell us what you think. Give us your vision.
A lot of you are probably asking yourselves,
"How is this party going to be any different?"
Promises have been made and broken in the
past, and concerns that this cycle won't end
are legitimate. But our vision is different for
one main reason: It belongs to all of us. We will

not be fighting our own battles, but rather the
battles of the student body.
This is not to say MSA has not made signifi-
cant strides over the years. What we aim to do,
however, is to close the gap that exists between
the assembly and the student body. Our vision
is for an assembly that goes out of its way to
inform and engage the student body rather
than sitting back and waiting for the student
body to come to it.
We will talk to the students about real, sub-
stantive ideas. There will be no flyers with
clever monikers and empty promises. We will
give students actual information about the
issues they care about and what we will do to
solve them.
What is being done to increase campus light-
ing? How can we improve busing? How can
we combat rising tuition? Is it possible to shift
spring break to be more aligned with other
colleges? As a means to facilitate this ongo-
ing conversation, we will have a forum on our
website, michiganvisionparty.com. We hope all
of you will become a part of this free and hon-
est exchange of ideas, discussing how we can
improve our campus.
We will be held accountable. Every member
of our party will have one specific, substantive
idea that will become that person's platform. If
an issue is not being dealt with properly, you will
know where to turn. We will act as your place to
turn in times of trouble, not an exclusive body
disconnected from your true concerns.
We will be your voice. If others do not heed
our concerns, we will band together to make a
difference.
Our mass meeting is today at 8:00 p.m. in
Room 3411 of Mason Hall. We hope you will
come and join us, to get involved and to learn
about how, together, we can create a better,
more interactive and more transparent student
government. Our party is about vision. Your
vision. Our vision. The Michigan vision.
So take a look into the future of student gov-
ernment. Let us know what you see.
This viewpoint was written by
the Michigan Vision Party.

Feb. 10 was a big day in Israeli politics. For the past few
months, the recent elections have been a source of tension,
with the center party, Kadima, and the center-right party,
Likud, competing for majority seats in the parliament and
for prime minister. Although Tzipi Livni, who has been
the head of Kadima since Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's
resignation in September, had the chance to form a coali-
tion a few months ago, the parties on the left held too few
chairs in the Knesset to form a majority. That difficulty
predicted the future challenges of either center-leaning
party to form a coalition.
The exact seating of the parties in coalition hasn't been
announced, however, the recent elections showed a sig-
nificant shift in the views of Israeli citizens toward the
right. Both Livni and Binyamin Netanyahu, the head of
Likud, are claiming victory in this election. Although
Kadima gained more seats in the election, Likud still has
the upper hand. With Yisrael Beiteinu, the party of the far
right, gaining four seats and Likud gaining 15, the right is
in the best position toform a coalition and gain a majority
of seats in the government. In Israel, the right side of the
political spectrum is less willing to compromise on land.
The left, on the other hand, is willing to consider more
peaceful options. Although the new prime minister has
yet to be announced, predictions point to Netanyahu.
So where does that leave us now? It is not surprising
that Israeli citizens would vote right as a result of the
recent war with Gaza. American politics, however, fol-
lowed a different trend with the left becoming stronger
as people grew increasingly more tired of war. The differ-
ent attitudes of the U.S. and Israeli governments toward
war will pose a problem for U.S. President Barack Obama.
Although Obama called the Israel-Palestine peace pro-
cess one of his top priorities, it will be more difficult for
America to work with a right wing Israeli government
that is less inclined to negotiate or even address the con-
flict with Palestinians, as past governments have been
under Kadima.

As part of the left-wing Zionist movement, The Union
of Progressive Zionists works toward a peaceful two-
state solution in the Middle East. But how should we react
when we're not in support of the future government of the
country we love so much? Currently, we are a small group
here on campus, with the goal of promoting education and
dialogue on the current situation as well as promoting our
ideals: peace, equality and social justice for all citizens.
You might have noticed on Facebook that people have
been "donating their statuses," using applications like
"QuassamCount" or "SupportGaza." Even though this
"activism" seems unimportant, it portrays a deeper issue
within our generation. People often focus merely on statis-
tics and one-sided views from the media and ignore the big-
ger picture. We need to address our problems' roots, and we
can't do that by pointing fingers and refusingto take respon-
sibility. It is imperative that we not blindly support one side.
As members of a left-wing movement, we are not in support
of a right-wing government in Israel. This doesn't mean that
we aren't Zionists. It is important that we not automatically
agree with all of Israel's policies just because we are Zion-
ist. As Zionists, we have a vision of equality for all citizens,
and a separate state for Palestinians. Our criticism of Israel's
government, therefore, does not come from an anti-Israel
approach, but from the fear that without a peaceful, two-
state solution, Israel's existence could be at risk.
Withthe results of the electionslastweek,we urge every- '
one totake the extra step and educate themselves on differ-
ent perspectives of the situation. Form your own opinion
- do not simply take the views of the extreme right, or the
radical left. While the path to peace may not be looking too
bright, we still hold hope for the future. Although they may
currently be a minority, there are still many Israeli citizens
who believe in dialogue and education toward peace. Let's
help their voices be heard.
Bria Gray and Alex Levy are the President of UPZ
and a member of the executive board, respectively.

the actors (the writers deserve the most
blame), the college students depicted in
this film are perhaps the most pathetic,
unlikable and downright stupid victims
ever to grace a "Friday the 13th" film.
And that's saying a lot.
But the film's biggest fault is its famil-
iarity. At times "Friday the 13th" feels
amusingly postmodern in its attempts to
poke fun at the conventions of the sub-
genre, but most of the time it seems con-
tent to merely tread the same ground as
its predecessors. No one is going to see
a film like this looking for high art, but
even those just seeking a good slasher
film might find this movie redundant and
annoyingly derivative.
Still, "Friday the 13th" is what it is.
Complaining about a film like this for
being derivative is about as pointless as
throwing the same criticism at a James
Bond film. Ultimately, viewers come to
these movies because of their familiarity.
If that's the case, this "Friday" is a minor
winner, as it delivers everything the ear-
lier movies did - mainly boobs and blood
- in spades.
So, while not impressive - even as
a slasher film - this remake is a decent
time-waster, even:if it can't compare to
its brethren from the '80s.

Self-portraiture is usually seen as one
of two things: either a somewhat
narcissistic piece of art made by a
well-known, self-congratulating artist, or
a somewhat narcissistic
MySpace photo taken by a
not-so-well-known, self-
congratulating person.
The idea of self-portrai-
ture has changed over
the years, especially with
the advent of the digital
camera. It has become too WiNY'
easy to make an image POW
of yourself - just point and
click, and there you go; a second later you
have a hazy-eyed picture of yourself that you
can immediately review.
The idea of the narcissistic self-portrait
is different, though, when you consider the
other end of this concept: When you're stuck
in a quiet room with a mirror, your lovely
face and some ink pens. And you sit there
staring at yourself for hours. In that time,
you'll probably be able to produce a few
sketches of differing, flattering-to-unflatter-
ing quality.
I don't think we spend enough time with
our faces. It's the fleetingness of it, really:
We glance at ourselves in mirrors or reflec-
tive coffee shop windows for a few seconds
a few times a day. And similarly, we catch
fleeting glances of ourselves in the digital
photographs that are posted, quantity over
quality, on social networking sites. These
self-portraits are just glimpses, and in the
same way, we flip through these photos after
glancing at each for a second of two at a
time. We don't really look at ourselves.
And glimpsing is different than looking.
Glimpsing means spending as little time as
possible with our faces and their unsightly
bits: zits, moles and floppy chins. Looking,
on the other hand, means staring at these
faults of ours without flinching. We're our
own worst critics, and it really is hard to
look at the things we dislike about ourselves.
It might actually be a good thing that we
aren't able to see ourselves without the aid
of something - a mirror, a camera, the bowl
of a spoon.
With this in mind, self-portraiture can
be self-congratulating, but more often than
not, it's self-critical. It forces artists to stare
at signs of old age and imperfection and
re producethosethings ona canvas, in a
photograph or in a sketch book. Whether or
not these imperfections are re-created in the
image is an entirely different story; the per-
sonma ycdos6f se coverhhem up or display'
them at his orcher own discretion. But the
point is that analog self-portraiture involves
a persistent stare at oneself, one's faults and
one's changing self-understanding.
Chuck Close is a world-renowned Ameri-
can artist primarily known for his photo-
realistic portraits and self-portraits. Much
of his art is painted on larger-than-life
canvases that can be as big as 10 feet by 12
feet. Close's concept of himself as an artist
changed, however, when in 1988 he suddenly
became paralyzed from the neck down.
Although he was able to regain some control
of his body, he had to have paint brushes
attached to his arms in order to paint. He
still continued to work, however, and it is
fascinating to see how his self-portrayal has
changed over the years.

Close's self-portrait titled Big Self-
Portrait, painted from 1967 to 1968 depicts
the skinny, artsy upstart shirtless from
the shoulders up. He has a smoldering
cigarette in his mouth, his eyes are eerily
half-opened and hazy. His head is tipped
upward, cockily daringsomeone to chal-
lenge him. The image appears self-appreci-
ating. It's a glamour portrait that suggests
youth, drugs and sex.
Close produced another self-portrait
called, yes, Self-Portrait in 1977. In this
painting, Close has a full beard, and his hair-
line has receded to the top of his head. The
painting still depicts him from the shoulders
up, although this time he looks directly at
the viewer in his collared, button-up shirt.
His eyes are open, expressive and lucid. His
image suggests his stark reality: he is the
aging painter.
Finally, we'll jump to 2000, 12 years after
he became paralyzed form the neck down.
The portrait is also titled Self-Portrait,
though the painting contains only his head
from the neck up. This reminds us of the fact
that this is the only part of Close's body over
which he has immediate agency. He is com-
pletely bald. His eyes look off the corner of
the picture, evasive, suggestingsomething
that has been closed-off or disconnected.
Perhaps it's meant to remind the viewer that
his paintings are now made with the help of
an assistant, because Close does not paint
these intimate portraits by himself anymore.
Close's self-portrayal changed a great
degree over a period of forty years. And the
way we see ourselves changes over time
as well, for better or for worse; it's paral-
lel to how our looks, our memories and our
relationships change. Who we are is grittier
than what the haphazard glance will reveal,
and a self-portrait contains more than
attractive aesthetics; it contains personal
meaning, the passage of time and details
we might not want people to know or care
about. It's honest, and honesty is not always
pretty.
Staring at yourself
in the mirror isn't
just narcissistic.
The fact that a self-portrait, by its own
nature, encourages self reflection is unique.
' Byspehding time withour own image;
somethingwe rarely spend more than an
hour a day looking at unadorned, we are
forced to look at ourselves in a way that can't
be replicated with the instantglimpses of
digital cameras and the age of profile pic-
tures. We've begun to take the self-portrait
for granted as something that is effortless to
create, and equally effortless to delete if it
depicts us in an unfavorable light.
A self-portrait is easy to conceive. Mini-
mally, it takes a pen, a napkin, a mirror and
an opened eye. What may be more difficult is
looking at yourself in a way that's more than
just a casual glance.
Pow wants to paint your self-portrait.
Explain to her why that doesn't make
any sense at poww@umich.edu.


An odd couple in advertising

By TOMMY COLEMAN
For the Daily
The buddy comedy is a subgenre that
always holds great
potential. From Joe and
Jerry in "Some Like
it Hot" to Harry and Trust Me
Lloyd in "Dumb and
Dumber," it's still sat- Mondays at
isfying to see two best 10 p.m.
friends screw around TNT
and stick together
through thick and thin.
"TrustMe"isaworkplacedramedythat
follows the exploits of an odd couple in the
advertising world. Mason (Eric McCor-
mack, "Will and Grace") is the respon-
sible half - a high-strung, hard-working
art director. Connor (Tom Cavanagh,
"Ed") is the goofball - a fast-talking but
laid-back copywriter. The duo works
as a creative team at a fictional Chicago
agency called Rothman, Greene & Mohr,
which also houses some other memora-
ble personalities. There's Monica Potter
(Sarah Krajicek-Hunter, "Boston Legal"),
a talented but neurotic and thin-skinned
newcomer to the office, and the hilarious
team of Tom (Mike Damus, "Numb3rs")
and Hechtor (Geoffrey Arend, "Greek"),
a mischief-making pair who, when their
powers combine, become the agency's
two-headed village idiot.
Indeed, Rothman, Greene & Mohr

proves to be the ideal setting for "Trust
Me." The preposterously pressure-filled
atmosphere of the world of advertising
quickens the pace of the show. In addi-
tion, advertising executives work in pairs
(one art director with one copywriter),
which is perfect for a buddy series. Pre-
dictably, some of the most powerful
scenes in "Trust Me" are those featur-
ing Mason and Connor hard at work in
fierce brainstorming sessions, where
each spews out ideas, both compelling
and awful, for their latest advertising
campaign.
This competitive environment fre-
quently puts Mason and Connor's rela-
tionship to the test. In the pilot, Mason
and Connor's stressed-out boss kicks the
bucket, and the agency's creative direc-
A well-played
buddy comedy.
tor Tony Mink (Griffin Dunne, "Law &
Order: Criminal Intent") needs to find
a replacement. He chooses Mason to fill
the position. Connor is upset that his
partner chose not to tell him about the
promotion, and their friendship must
survive the added tension. It's clear this
symbiotic relationship will be consis-

tently tested through the rest of the sea-
son with similar plot lines.
Unlike "Mad Men," AMC's popular
drama-heavy series about a New York
City advertising agency in the 1960s,
"Trust Me" finds humor in the stress-
ful world of advertising. During one of
Mason and Connor's brainstorming ses-
sions for a client, Arc-Mobile, a fictional
telephone company, Connor humorously
suggests that a gladiator named "Spar-
text-icus" be the mascot for the brand,
"slaying a lion with one hand and texting

with the other."
Whether they're
getting along or not,
it's McCormack
and Cavanagh that
hold the whole show
together. When they
aren't working on an
ad campaign, they
quibble and squabble
like an old married
couple over anything
and everything. But
it's obvious that, at the
end of the day, they'll
still be pals.
Watching these two
talented actors bicker,
fight andmakeupforan
hour each week prom-
ises, if nothing else, to
be entertaining.

Venezuela votes to end term imits I PELL GRANTS

54 percent of voters
support proposal
CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -
President Hugo Chavez won a ref-
erendum to eliminate term limits
yesterday, paving the way for him
to run again in 2012 - and beyond
- and push through his vision of a
socialist Venezuela.
Fireworks exploded in the sky
and caravans of supporters cel-
ebrated in the streets, waving red
flags and honking horns.

With 94 percent of the vote
counted, 54 percent had voted in
favor of the constitutional amend-
ment, National Electoral Council
chief Tibisay Lucena aninounced.
Forty-six percenthad voted against
the measure to eliminate term lim-
its on all public officials, too few
to make up the distance with the
remaining votes.
"Today we opened wide the
gates of the future. Venezuela will
not return to its past of indignity,"
Chavez proclaimed after singing
the national anthem from the bal-

cony of his Miraflores palace.
Voters on both sides said their
decision was crucial to the future
of Venezuela, a deeply polarized
country where Chavez has spent a
tumultuous decade in power chan-
neling tremendous oil wealth into
combating gaping social inequality.
The recorded blare of bugles
jarred Venezuelans awake before
dawn, and long lines formed even
before the polls opened at 6 a.m.
Information Minister Jesse Cha-
con projected turnout as high as 70
percent.

People voting "yes" said Chavez
has given poor Venezuelans cheap
food, free education and quality
health care, and empowered them
with a discourse of class strug-
gle after decades of U.S.-backed
governments that favored the
rich. No successor has emerged,
and voters said they worry their
gains will vanish if Chavez leaves
office.
"If Chavez loses, his social
achievements will all disappear,"
said Richard Mijares, a 40-year-
old secretary.

These funding increases come at
a time of need for students and fam-

VIDEOGAMES
From Page 1A
"It's clear that (videogames) are
motivating,"Fishmansaid. "There's
something about a well-designed
game that is compelling."
The goal, Fishman said, is to
explore why educators haven't
shaped high school algebra, or Sta-
tistics 350, in the videogame mold.
"Playisthe oldest formoflearning,"
Fishman said. "But when we designed
schools, we went away from that."
Fishman stressed that the course
is notjust fun and games. It focuses
on the relationship between videog-
ame technology and social science
in the field of education - some-
thing that, Fishman said, is not a
new concept.
Fishman pointed out that the mili-
tary has been at the forefront of using
videogames as tools for learning.
Simulators and virtual experi-
ences can present elements and
situations that live training, or book
theory, cannot re-create, Fish-
man said. The armed forces also
used videogames to help with their
recruitment needs.
Fishman said he often invites
colleagues and professionals in the
field to be guest speakers to stimu-
late class discussions. His list of
future speakers includes game
designers, educational researchers
and game developers.
As part of the course curriculum,
students are required to do their
own at-home research by playing
video games, Kinesiology junior
Josh Leskar said in an e-mail. But
Leskar stressed that this type of
homework is not just all play.
"Sure, we get to play video games
for homework throughout the semes-
ter," Leskar said. "But we also haveto
do a lotofcthinking about what we are
playing, and why we are playing it."
There are currently 70 students
in Fishman's course, and because
of such popularity, he expects the
class will be a regular offering for
the winter term.
While parents might gripe about
videogames' negative role in child-
hood development and question the
necessity ofa college course dedicated

himself and his family," Jacobs said
yesterday before the quarterback
announced his intention to leave
the Wolverines. "He's going to do
what's best and do the right thing.
I'm supportive of the kid."
Threet enrolled at Georgia Tech
in January 2007 but transferred
after spring practice. He cited the
departure of Yellow Jacket offen-
sive coordinator Patrick Nix, who
primarily recruited Threet, as the
main reason for the transfer.
Although Michigan had five-star
quarterback Ryan Mallett, Threet
told Jacobs he wasn't intimidated.
Threet thought he outplayed Mal-
lett at Michigan's quarterbackcamp
after his junior year of high school,
Jacobs told The Michigan Daily
in September 2008. When Threet
decided to transfer to Michigan,
Jacobs said the quarterback called
him with a simple message.
"'Coach, I'm going to go back
to Michigan, and I'm going to beat
Mallett out for that starting job,' "
Jacobs said Threet told him.
Threet sat out the 2007 season
because of NCAA transfer rules,

and Mallett transferred to Arkan-
sas after that season.
Threet competed with Sheridan,
a former walk-o during spring

to the study, Fishman argues that our
culture has entered a different era.
"Videogames are a huge part of
popular culture," Fishman said.
As for the concerns of elder gen-
erations, he says that it is normal.
"This world doesn't look like the
world they remember."
Even games that have sparked
outrage and public debate have
some intrinsic value worthy of
study, Fishman said.
"Grand Theft Auto is full of fas-
cinating ethical problems," he said.
"You could shoot the guy, or you
could choose not to."
Fishman hopes that other uni-
versities take advantage of popular
technology to enhance the classroom
learning experience, and not to sepa-
rate the classroominto technological
and non-technological divisions.
"I want schools to take advantag
that lots of kids have iPods, lots of kids
have cell phones. Video games are a
part of that," he said, noting how his
class doesn'tuaeleglrs," blujtcgk
messaging to participatein lectures.
Fishman's class is part of a larger
movement in the University to push
the importance of popular technol-
ogy in modern learning. A videog-
ame archive on North Campus that
plans to make every videogame
ever created available to students is
another example.
The goal of the course is not nec-
essarily to train future teachers,
Fishman said, but to make educa-
tion better.
Leskar says he definitely has
learned a lot in the class, adding
that every lecture is a pleasure to
attend and he is glad he enrolled.
"I was blown away. Before this
class, I figured that video games
could improve hand-eye coordina-
tion, and 'educational' video games
like MathBlasters could help you
with fast math," Leskar said. "How-
ever, there are so many things you
can learn from a multitude of vid-
eogame types - from Call of Duty
to Madden NFL '09, each game can
teach you topics from math to time
management to forward thinking
and planning, among a multitude of
other ideas."
"Plus," Leskar said, "video games
are fun. What did I have to lose?"
and fall practices for the starting
job. Sheridan started in the season
opener, but Threet got the start-
ing nod in the next game against
Miami (Ohio).
"It's frustrating not to hit the
passes to help the team. win more
than anything," Threet said after
the Miami game, in which he went
6-of-13 for 63 yards, including one
50-yard screen pass. "Some passes,
some plays, I'd like to have back. But
that's the situation, so you justkeep
on working, and try and come back
next week and make the plays."
Threet's breakout start came
against Notre Dame on Sept. 13.
In South Bend, he went 16-of-23
for 175 yards, one touchdown and
no interceptions. He started seven
more games but missed two of
Michigan's final three games with
a shoulder injury. He didn't play at
Minnesota and didn't make the trip
to Ohio State. Threet said early last
season that being Michigan's quar-
terback wouldn't affect his laid-
back personality.
"I feel that I can be focused,
but be myself at the same time,"
Threet said. "Me as a person, I can't
be uptight. I don't like that feel-
ing, so that's not how I'm going to
approach a game."

Harris explodes for 26 points,

Daily Sports Writer
EVANSTON - Michigan sophomore Manny Harris couldn't
remember the last time he was in "the zone."
But during the Michigan men's basketball team's 70-67 over-
time victory yesterday at Northwestern, he found it.
"Today, I was able to get in the zone," said Harris, who scored
25 points in the second half and overtime. "And that was a good
thing."
Yesterday's game at Welsh-Ryan Arena was the first of four
road trips the Wolverines (6-7 Big Ten, 16-10 overall) will make in
their final six games. Entering the game, Michigan had just one
road win, a 72-66 victory over Indiana on Jan. 7.
Michigan needed to top the Wildcats.
And ultimately, the outcome was all in Harris's hands.
"I said, 'Fresh, we're going down with you,' " fifth-year senior
C.J. Lee said of Harris, whose nickname is "Manny Fresh."
"'You're our guy, and you know it. Just do what you do."'
Harris scored just one point in the first half, sitting the final

11 minutes of the frame after picking up his second foul. Harris
said that early in the season, the two early fouls would have been
frustrating. But yesterday, he stayed positive.
He came out looking possessed in the second half, scoring the
Wolverines' first nine points of the stanza and 12 of their final 17.
"Your confidence is so high, and your swagger's up so high,"
Harris said of being in the zone. "You feel like you're going to
make every shot."
A loss would have flipped the two squads in the Big Ten stand-
ings, dropping the Wolverines to ninth and putting Northwest-
ern (4-8,13-10) in eighth.
The win moves Michigan just one game behind the logjam for
fifth between Minnesota, Penn State and Wisconsin. The Wol-
verines play the Golden Gophers twice and the Badgers once in
their final five games.
But Harris's effort almost went for naught.
The Wolverines blew a five-point lead in the final one minute
and 44 seconds of regulation, highlighted by an off-balanced
3-pointer by Northwestern's Kevin Coble.

EVANSTON - The sound of The
Victors echoed out of the visitors
locker room in Welsh-Ryan Arena.
After five straight road losses, the
Wolverines finally had something
to cheer about yesterday after they
knocked off Northwestern 70-67.
All season, Michigan coach John
Beilein has stressed the necessity of
staying poised on the road.
But in the final minutes of the

second half, the Wolverines' poise
seemed to dissolve as the lanky
Wildcat defenders applied theirtrap
zone defense.
In the last minute and 23 seconds,
Michigan's guards turned the ball
over three times to let a three-point
lead wash away.
The most costly of the turnovers
came as fifth-year senior C.J. Lee
attempted to split two defenders
and had the ball slapped out of his
hands. The steal set up Northwest-
ern forward Kevin Coble's acrobatic

3-pointer that forced overtime.
As the Wolverines tried to score
a game-winning basket, Lee com-
mitted another turnover, giving the
Wildcats a chance to win in regula-
tion.
Heading into the deciding peri-
od, Beilein gathered his players and
reminded them to stay collected.
"You really got to make eye con-
tact with your players at that time
and say, 'We're in this together.
You're going to make this thing hap-
pen, but you're going to have to will

it to happen. They're not going to go
away. They want this as bad as you
do. You just got to work your hard-
est,' " Beilein said.
In the final minutes of overtime,
it looked like Michigan might blow
its lead again.
Freshman guard Stu Douglass
turned the ball over with a four-
point lead and then junior forward
DeShawn Sims fouled out, hitting
Coble while he attempted a 3-point
shot.
Coble hit all three freebies and'

Michigan's lead dwindled to one.
But the Wolverines showed their
poise in one crucial area that ended
up being the difference maker -
free throws.
Lee and forward sophomore for-
ward Manny Harris both stepped
to the charity stripe in the closing
moments and knocked down key
free throws.
"I'm kind of calm on the free-
throw end," Harris said. "I thinkI'm
going to make a lot of shots, but my
wrist was kind of bothering me the

last couple games, and I was missing
a couple free throws that I should
make. Iwas just telling myself,'Your
wrist don't hurt. It don't hurt.You're
going to make every free throw.' "
Harris hit 9-of-10free throws and
Michigan scored 21 points from the
line in a game that was tightly offici-
ated with many touch fouls.
Although the Wolverines' poise
wasn't as solid as Beilein would have
liked, he knows how difficult it can
be to win on the road in the Big Ten.

Blue goes winless at
ITA Indoor Nationals

By MARK BURNS
Daily Sports Writer
Three matches against top-20
opponents.
Three losses.
One miserable weekend - or
was it?
The No. 18 Michigan men's
tennis team competed in the ITA
National Team Indoor Champion-
ship this weekend in Chicago with
high hopes of performing well
against the country's top competi-
tion.
After three days of intense,
hard-fought matches, Michigan
coach Bruce Berque and the Wol-
verines (5-4) had zero wins to
show for their effort.
"This weekend was an opportu-
nity to compete in some matches
that were not originally on our
schedule," Berque said. "I knew
there was the possibility of coming
away with no wins, but I thought
we could at least win one match."
After falling to No. 2 Texas on
Friday (4-0) and No. 7 Florida on
Saturday -(4-1), the Wolverines
looked to gain some positive expe-
riences from the weekend.
Michigan began play yesterday
against No. 16 Florida State, hop-
ing to win its first doubles point on
the weekend. But the Wolverines'
drought continued with a loss.
"Our doubles did not provide us
with the start we wanted all week-
end," Berque said.
Michigan regrouped after the
doubles disappointment, need-
ing to win four of the six singles

matches to come away with the
win.
With the singles score knot-
ted at two matches apiece, junior
George Navas won his match in
three sets (3-6, 6-1, 6-1). The win
set the stage for sophomore Jason
Jung to clinch the match with a
win.
But Jung fell to 30th-ranked
Jean-Yves Aubone, giving the
Seminoles the 4-3 match victory.
The Wolverines' third loss in
three days was not necessarily a
setback, according to Berque. But
Michigan's inability to come away
with the doubles point in all three
matches proved to be the biggest
disappointment on the weekend.
The bounces weren't going the
right way for the Wolverines yes-
terday, and Berque felt the players
allowed their emotions to affect
their performance, something
Michigan can't afford to let hap-
pen if it plans to grab a second
straight Sweet 16 berth in the
NCAA Tournament.
"It wasn't a lack of focus," Ber-
que said, "But it was a feeling sor-
ry-for-yourselves mentality that
hurt us."
Berque hopes his team can be
more resilient and competitive
next weekend as Michigan hosts
Harvard at the Varsity Tennis
Center.
"The level of our abilities hasn't
changed," Berque said. "We need
to remember we played against
some great competition. Ifwe start
to practice better and continue to
stay confident, we'll be fine."

Wolverines need to look to the
future to salvage this season

ROB MIGRIN/Da iy
The Michigan baseball team's games in Florida should be on your vacation itinerary
The ultimate
Michigaan sports
S ing Bea

Spring Break is coming in a
few short days, and if you're
anything like my house-
mates and me, you still have no
plans.
Luckily, the Michigan Athletic
Department
has your back.
It turns out that
a week of driv-
ing around the
country follow-
ing Michigan
sports teams
could turn into NATE
a pretty good SANDALS
trip.
DAY 1: While you're stuck in
town Thursday night waiting for
your one friend who has a Friday
class, check out the Big Ten Wom-
en's Swimming and Diving Cham-
pionships at Canham Natatorium
(next to the IM Building).
Canham is heated to feel like a
tropical island, so it's practically
the same thing as the Caribbean.
Also, watching the 10-meter plat-
form diving isn't all that different
from cliff jumping in Jamaica.
DAY 2: Friday afternoon, head
south to Columbus to take in a
Michigan hockey game against
Ohio State. Walking up and down
High Street always feels like
Spring Break - if you normally
end up fearing for your life in a
cold-weather climate for vacation.
DAY 3: Now, we head into the
best stretch of your Michigan
sports road trip. From Columbus,
start driving south. You need to
make it to Tallahassee, Fla., by 10
a.m. on Saturday. Google Maps
says it should only take about 13
hours, so leave straight from the
hockey game and don't stop driv-
ing, not even for bathroom breaks.
If you follow these instructions,
you should reach the Florida State
campus in time for the Michigan
softball team's game against East
Carolina.
DAY 4: It's a shorter trip today,
driving south to St. Petersburg to
watch the Michigan baseball team
play St. John's at 1 p.m. Nothing
says Spring Break like baseball.
What's the difference between
Spring Break and spring training?

Just one word.
The game should be over by the
late afternoon, so take the rest of
the day to check out some of the
great sights in the St. Petersburg/
Tampa area. I won't pretend to
know what any of those are, but
I'm sure you can find them.
DAY 5: Congratulations, Michi-
gan Athletic Department, you've
ruined this trip by not having any
teams scheduled to play on Mon-
day, Feb. 23. Well, you're already
in Florida, so there's just one thing
to do: Disney World.
The "most magical place on
Earth" is less than two hours
away. There will probably be tons
of Wolverine fans and alums at
Disney World. Of course, most of
them will be there with their small
children.
DAY 6: Now, you have to make
a choice. You could head back to
Tallahassee for another Michigan
softball game, or you could get
a head start on the trip south for
the women's tennis match against
Miami on Thursday.
If you really like softball, go for
it. But two days on South Beach,
plus a tennis match - you can't go
wrong.
The rest of the trip will probably
be a haze once you get to Miami.
Crazy stuff happens there. Be safe,
and don't forget to make it to the
tennis match. Remember that you
have to be back in class on Monday
and it takes about 21 hours to get
back to Ann Arbor from Miami.
And if you're still looking for
some Michigan sports teams to
watch on your way home, you
might want to swing by Blooming-
ton for the women's track and field
Big Ten Indoor Championships.
By the time you get back to Ann
Arbor, you will have driven for
about two days total.
And you'll probably have seen
more non-revenue Michigan
sports in one week than most stu-
dents will in four years.
It should be fun.

this trip, Sandals would like to
hear about it. He can be reached

an excess of
experience with four seniors in
the starting lineup, and there's
never a shortage of leadership on
the floor.
But with a once-comanding
lead beginning to dwindle last
night against Minnesota, Borseth
decided to go with fresh legs. Not
because his senior leaders were
tired, but because they had lost
their rhythm.
And after losses in nine of
their last 10 games, the Wolver-
ines have ridden the rhythm from
a 7-4 non-conference start into
the Big Ten basement.
So in desperate need of a play-
maker last night, Borseth didn't
turn to one of his veteran start-
ers. He turned to a freshman who
had played just nine minutes in
the team's first five games.
With the way forward Carmen
Reynolds has been playing lately,
leading Michigan (3-11,10-15) in
scoring with 34 points in the last
two games, she deserves a spot in
the starting lineup. With Reyn-
olds on the court, the Wolverines
don't have to wait for rhythm to
find them. She creates rhythm for
them.
"She's good in traffic,"
Borseth said last week. "She can
shoot well. She passes well. She
sees the floor. She's got really
good hands ... She's just able to
make some real quick decisions
that most players aren't able to
make."
Borseth has made it clear sev-
eral times in his two seasons at
Michigan that without rhythm
and quick playmaking, this team
won't succeed.
"Shooting is all about rhythm,"
Borseth said after losing to Mich-
igan State in the WNIT quarter-
finals last season. "If you can't
get rhythm shots, they're hard to
make."

would disappear soon enough.

'M' drops another heartbreaker at home

Apparently, in Minnesota, the
bank is open on Sundays.
Golden Gopher junior guard
Brittney McCoy banked a 3-point-
er off the backboard with just
1.9 seconds left in the Michigan
women's basketball team's game
last night at Crisler Arena.
The
basket MINNESOTA 60
clinched MICHIGAN 59
a 60-59
win for the Gophers (10-4 Big
Ten, 18-7 overall), and caused the
Wolverines' record in their last 12
games to fall to 2-10.
Only momentsearlier, it seemed
as though Michigan (3-11, 10-15)
had secured the victory when
Minnesota senior guard Emily
Fox, the team's leading scorer,
fouled out, after jostling senior
Jessica Minnfield.
"Minnfield was the last person
we wanted to foul, because she's
shooting a ridiculous percentage
at the free throw line," Minnesota
coach Pam Borton said.
With 15 seconds left and a
chance to extend the Wolverines'
one-point lead, Minnfield calmly
walked to the line and knocked

defense that led the charge.
"It's almost like a man
(defense)," Michigan coach Kevin
Borseth said. "Like a chasing man
(defense)."
In the zone, Minnesota's top
two defenders wreaked havoc
on the Wolverine guards, forc-
ing them to make bad passes and
quick, ill-advised decisions.
The Gophers were coming off a
bye week which they used to work
on their stifling zone defense, hop-
ing to create more offense from
their defense. It worked. They
forced 22 Michigan turnovers that
resulted in 27 of their 60 points.
The game had all the makings
of a blowout when the Wolver-
ines took a 13-point lead, but the
Gophers went on a 17-2 run in the
final six minutes of the first half.
And in a game that was depen-
dent on runs, that one was crucial,
giving Minnesota a two-point
lead heading into halftime. Even
though the Michigan outscored
the Gophers 35-34 in the second
half, Minnesota's feeble 2-point
cushion at halftime gave them the
necessary padding needed.
As the team sinks lower in the
Big Ten standings, Borseth can
take comfort in the fact that his
underclassmen are stepping up.
Against Minnesota, freshman
Carmen Reynolds led the under-
classmen with 14 points.
"They've lost a lot of close
games and I don't think their
record indicates what type of
basketball team they are," Bor-
ton said. "They are very balanced.
They got shooters. They got great
post players. They got kids that
can get in the lane.
"I think it's just a matter of
time (before they) put things
together."
NOTE: Michigan donned pink-
and-white uniforms as a part of
the WBCA's Pink Zone initiative
to raise money and awareness for
breast cancer. The team auctioned
off these uniforms, and did other

'M' topples Penn
State, sends its three
seniors out with big-
time Big Ten win
By MIKE FLOREK
DailySports Writer
In the dimlylitCliff KeenArena,
fifth-year senior Tyrel Todd came
out of the tunnel at a speed any
sprinter would be proud of and met
his weak-in-the-knees freshman
opponent in the center of the mat.
This one meant a little more.
Todd scored a pin in a 31-6 win
for No. 17 Michigan (4-1-1 Big Ten,
9-7-1 overall) over No. 24 Penn
State (1-5-2,8-11-2) onSenior Night.
Three seniors were in the starting
lineups for the Wolverines.
"I've thought about our senior
night since my freshman year,"
Todd said. "People ask you how
you want to go out, and I couldn't
have pictured it much different."
Todd's fall came one minute and
38 seconds into his match. That is
his third pin in as many matches
and his team-leading ninth this
season.
"I'm telling myself, 'I'm pinning
myself through the Big Ten, pin-
ning my way through nationals,'"
Todd said. "I'm getting pretty good
with this head scoop, and guys

Luke, the top 174-pounder in the
nation, established a three-point
lead before allowing 16th-ranked
Quentin Wright to take him down
and get back into the match. But
Luke scored an escape and kept
his undefeated streak intact at 22
matches.
"I've won a lot of close matches
in my college career," Luke said.
"I think that's what separates the
average wrestler from the good
wrestler. You just have to figure
out how to win matches."
Watts, ranked 17th at 125
pounds, fell behind early but even-
tually came back.
After throwing his opponent
to the ground with a thump loud
enough for it to echo throughout
the arena and bring the crowd to
its feet, he scored two points for a
near-fall to take a two-point lead.
But Penn State's No.13 Brad Pat-
aky let that lead last only eleven
seconds as he took the bout 11-9.
"(Watts) had struggled with him
in those first periods," McFarland
said. "But Mike got himself back in
that match, he just got caught in a
cement mixer there at the end and
lost a tough one."
Michigan's win seemed sec-
ondary in a night that seemed to
revolve around just three people.
"Those three seniors that wres-
tled today, we're proud to have
them in our program." McFarland
said.

Akron Open
By ROGER SAUERHAFT
Daily Sports Writer
Afterbeingnamed anAll-Amer-
ican as a junior in 2008, sprinter
Andre Barnes was relegated to
the sidelines with an ankle injury
for the first six weeks of his final
indoor season.
But his recent return to the
Michigan men's track and field
team and his continuing return to
All-American form gave the 13th-
ranked Wolverines a much-need-
ed boost at the non-scoring Akron
Open on Saturday.
Michigan coach Fred LaPlante
described his team's performance
as a "mixed bag," and somewhat
emblematic of this year's indoor
season, but Barnes helped the
team leave Ohio on a high note.
After a day in which he ran a
49.67-second 400-meter dash,
subpar by his standards, the West
Bloomfield native picked up the
pace and helped Michigan blow
away the field in the 4x400-meter
relay. The relay team's 3:13.05 time
in the finals was nearly three sec-
onds ahead of second-place East-
ern Michigan.
LaPlante was very encour-
aged by his team's relay win, but
he was disappointed that Ohio
State withdrew from the event
at the last minute. According to
LaPlante, the Buckeyes have one
of the best 4x400 relay teams in
the nation, and the competition
would have helped with the Big
Ten Championship meet looming

in two weeks.
"We were hoping they'd run in
it because we knew we'd run faster
if they were in it," LaPlante said.
"You usually run your best 4x400s
when two or three teams are fight-
ing the whole way. That's where
you set the really great marks.
"There's nothing wrong with
winning by alot, but usually your
best times are going to come in
those kind of situations."
LaPlante said Barnes's contin-
ued progress will also be impor-
tant for the Big Ten meet, given
how evenly matched the teams
have been this season.
"He's talented enough and
doing enough training that in
two weeks, he will be close to his
best," LaPlante said. "Once you've
achieved at a high level, if you've
done enough work and you're
mentally ready, it's amazing how
you can rise to the occasion."
Redshirt junior thrower Sean
Pruitt recorded the other win of
the day by winning the shot put
with the fifth-longest throw in
school history. The throw was his
second NCAA provisional mark
of the season. Pruitt also earned
a provisional on Jan. 17 in "The
Dual" against Ohio State in the
weight throw by breaking Michi-
gan's school record.
Distance runners Sean McNa-
mara and Craig Forys also had
big weekends at the Husky Invi-
tational in Seattle by running d
career-best times that netted each
runner an NCAA provisional time
in the 3,000-meter and 5,000-me-
ter events.
Next Saturday's Silverston
Invitational at the Indoor Track
Building will be the last home
meet of the indoor season and a
final tune-up for the conference
championship meet.

'M' secures first-
round bye in CCHA
Tournament with
series sweep
By NICOLE AUERBACH
Daily Sports Editor
It takes alot to get Michigan hock-
ey coach Red Berenson to smile.
Friday's 8-3 win over Nebraska-
Omaha? Nope.
"I'm a hard coach to play for and
I'm a hard coach to please," Beren-
son said after the game.
What about Saturday's thrill-
ing come-from-behind 4-2 victory,
which guaranteed a top-four finish
in the CCHA and a bye in the con-
ference tournament? No smile, but
he was more upbeat when describ-
ing his team's effort.
Berenson was pleased his players
clawed back into the contest after
facing a 2-0 deficit and a steady
stream of penalties. He offered
many criticisms, but one positive
comment may have been the most
important for Michigan to hear.
"This is team time of the year,"
Berenson said. "It doesn't matter
that your leading scorers are the
goal-getters. ... The team is cotaing
together."
It's a far cry from the early
games of the season, when just a
few forwards scored most of the
Wolverines' goals. But what is hap-
pening now - nine different play-
EISENSTEIN
From page 1B
they come down the stretch. At
this point last season, Michigan's
eventual Frozen Four-bound
team had six double-digit scorers,
including two who combined for
49 goals.
This year, the Wolverines have
just four, with one over 20. And
the difference between the two

ers lit the lamp this weekend - is
exactly what the Michigan coach-
ing staff predicted at the beginning
of the season: scoring by committee.
Everybody is stepping up, and not
just on offense.
Saturday's comeback displayed
this whole-hearted effort. Michigan
was on the penalty kill for most of
the first period, scrambling to block
shots and clear pucks. Senior goalie
Billy Sauer started
for the first time
since Jan. 17 and
faced an onslaught "This 1
of tough shots.
It all started tim
with a major penal-
ty called on senior e y
forward Titm Mill-
er for kneeing just Berens
six minutes into
the contest. Two
minutes into the
major, a Wolverine boarding pen-
alty gave Nebraska-Omaha a 5-on-3
advantage.
The Mavericks found the back of
the net twice within30 seconds dur-
ing the stretch. The first goal came
off a rebound and beat Sauer glove-
side, and the second was a laser that
tipped off the netminder's glove.
Michigan killed another 5-on-3
later in the period and the team took
a total of eight penalties in the first
21 minutes of the game. The high
number of penalties burdened the
Wolverines' typically solid penalty-
kill unit and disrupted the team's
substitution pattern.
"It's physically and emotionally
seasons in offensive output thus
far is just nine goals through 32
games.
What do all those numbers
mean? Michigan is getting con-
sistent scoring from each of its
lines. When Caporusso doesn't
find the back of the net, Glenden-
ing can step up and score one -
or two.
"This is team time of the year,
and it doesn't matter that your
leading scorers are the goal get-

draining," sophomore forward Matt
Rust said. "Anytime you can't get
your whole team rolling out there,
it's tough. It makes the game so
choppy."
The comeback began late in the
second period as the team stopped
takingpenalties and the offense final-
ly found rhythm on even strength.
"When we're playing five-on-
five, I think we're a tremendous
team," junior act-
ing captain Chris
Summers said. "We
.s team stopped playing
to the refs, and we
e of started playing our
,, game, and I think
ear, that was thebiggest
. difference."
on said. Two goals with
less than five min-
utes remaining in
the second frame
knotted the game at two, and Mich-
igan appeared destined for its first
overtime of the season after back-
and-forth play for most of the third.
But freshman walk-on forward
Luke Glendeningdidn't let that hap-
pen. With 4:28 left in regulation, he
streaked up the right side of the ice,
received a pass from sophomore for-
ward Logie Caporusso and flicked
in the game-winner. Glendening
eventually added an empty-netter
in the game's final minute.
"Even though we were two goals
down, I think our team was confi-
denttthattheycould get one back and
then another one, and that's kind of
what happened," Berenson said. "I
ters," Berenson said. "It doesn't
matter who scores, you just need
goals."
This mentality has translated
into a 10-2 second-half run and
catapulted the Wolverines from a
middle-of-the-pack CCHA team
to tied for second in the PairWise
ratings.
The ratings are used in deter-
mining NCAA Tournament seed-
itng.
More importantly, Michigan

thought our team stayed in the game
and played hard despite the officiat-
ing and despite the adversity."
The Wolverines haven't had many
of these types of games. Michigan is
just 7-8 on the season when giving
up the first goal. Of those victories,
many of them included first-period
comebacks, not ones in the game's
final minutes.
Rust said this kind of win couldn't
have come at a better time, with a big
series against Ohio State next week-
end and the postseason looming.
"It's good to give our team the
confidence that we can come back,
we can come from behind, we can
persevere," he said.
Michigan clinched a top-four fin-
ishin the CCHA withthe sweep and
Alaska's loss Friday. The Wolverines
will receive a first-round bye and
home-ice advantage for the CCHA
Tournament quarterfinal round in
early March.
But that doesn't mean they'll
relax. They want to push for a sec-
ond- or third-place finish, or at least
try to maintain the momentum
they've built up from winning 12 of
their last 14 contests.
"This time of year everybody's
good, everybody's playing hard,"
Berenson said. "We can't just sit
back and say, 'We've got more wins
than that team, so we'll beat them.'
You have to go out there and earn it.
You have to outwork them, outhit
them, outcheck them.
"This is what it's going to be like
every weekend. Hopefully we can
take our game to another level."
overtook Notre Dame in the Pair-
Wise this weekend. That means
the Wolverines would get the
edge over the Fighting Irish as
the No. 1 seed in the Grand Rapids
Regional, by far the closest loca-
tion to Ann Arbor.
And it's all because of one of
Michigan's strongest assets: its
depth.
