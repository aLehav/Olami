Regent says 'U'

By PETER SHA HIN
Daily News Editor
It was all on the table on
Thursday night - well, on the
screen, at least.
Regent Mark Bernstein, one of
the newest members of the Uni-
versity's Board of Regents, held
a Twitter Town Hall to answer
students' questions. Topics
ranged from renovations of the
recreational sports facilities and
the Michigan Union to college
affordability - all answered in
140 characters or less.
The event was co-hosted by
the Central Student Govern-
ment, whose president, Manish
Parikh, was standing by to help
run the event. Students from
various campus groups were also
on hand to promote the event
through their own tweets.
The originalintent ofthe event
was to help acquaint students
with the function and responsi-
bilities of a regent, Parikh said.
He estimated that about 120 stu-
dents tweeted at Bernstein over

The University's Board of

Led by a University Police
officer, Public Policy senior
Kevin Mersol-Barg crossed
State Street, hands cuffed
behind his back. Before enter-
ing the squad car, he uttered a
few words as chants advocating
in-state tuition equality were
echoed across the street.
"We won't rest until tuition
equality is passed," he said.
Mersol-Barg - who is a col-

- was one of eight protesters
arrested after blocking traffic
for around 30 minutes outside
the Michigan Union at State

House proposal
would cut $47M
from 'U' campuses in
wake of right to work
By DANIELLE
RAYKHINSHTEYN
Daily Staff Reporter
As a result of a bill introduced
in the Michigan House of Rep-
resentatives by Rep. Al Pscholka
(R-Stevensville) in late March, the
University could experience bud-
get cuts of $47 million between
the three campuses for the 2013-
2014 academic year, raising ques-
tions about the future of University
funding.
The bill allows for a $31 mil-
lion increase in the state budget's
allocation for higher education.
However, any institutions that
negotiated union contracts after
the right-to-work law went into
effect are penalized unless the new

contracts amount to at least 10 per-
cent in savings.
Because the University rati-
fied contracts with the Lecturers'
Employee Organization; the Grad-
uate Employees' Organization;
The American Federation of State,
County and Municipal employees;
the Michigan Nurses Association;
and the House Officers Associa-
tion, it could be faced with possible
cuts.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said it's still too soon to
know if the University will actually
face cuts or what its actions would
be if the cuts do go through.
"That's only a proposal in the
House," Fitzgerald said. "It's not
been approved by the House yet,
and there's a completely different
bill that doesn't have those kinds
of penalties that's working its way
through the Senate."
Fitzgerald added that the Uni-
versity's budget isn't finalized
until June, and won't be sent to the
University Board of Regents for

Phi Beta Kappa is the oldest and most widely recognized scholarly honorary society in America. Founded in 1776 at the College of William and
Mary, it celebrates excellence in the liberal arts and sciences. The UM chapter, Alpha of Michigan, was founded in 1907 and inducted its hundred and
fifth class into membership on April 14, 2013. An invitation to join Phi Beta Kappa requires a history of impeccable academic performance that
reflects not only grades but breadth and depth of intellectual engagement. Membership as a junior requires an almost perfect record. The Executive
Committee of the Alpha of Michigan Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa recognizes and congratulates the new members of this venerable society.

GRANDVILLE, Mich.
Kayakers find body
of missing woman
Authorities say kayakers found
the body of a missing western
Michigan woman in the water of
the flooded Grand River.
The body was found Tuesday
night near the Grandville and
Wyoming border, southwest of
Grand Rapids.
MLive.com says authorities
confirmed Wednesday that the
remains are those of 51-year-old
Mary Tornga.
Police say Tornga's husband
reported her missing Sunday.
They say he told them he and his
wife had an argument while driv-
ing about 1 a.m. Sunday. He says
she got out, planning to walk
home.
BOSTON
Boston official:
Video footage
shows bomb
suspect
In what could be a major break
in the Boston Marathon case,
investigators are on the hunt for
a man seen in a department-store
surveillance video dropping off a
bag at the site of the bombings, a
Boston politician said Wednes-
day.
Separately, a law enforcement
official confirmed that authori-
ties have found an image of a
potential suspect but don't know
his name.
The development - less than
48 hours after the attack that left
three people dead and more than
170 wounded - marked a pos-
sible turning point in a case that
has investigators analyzing pho-
tos and videos frame by frame for
clues to who carried out the twin
bombings and why.
SANTA CRUZ, Calif.
Official: School
couldn't expel
teens charged
with sexual crime
A school superintendent said
Wednesday that officials could
not expel three teenage boys
charged with sexually battering
ka classmate last fall, even after
she hanged herself and her fam-
ily complained that a humiliating
photo of the assault was being cir-
culated.
Saratoga schools superinten-
dent Bob Mistele made the dis-
closure about the three teens
suspected of assaulting 15-year-
old Audrie Pott at a party that he
said was not on campus or related
to school.
He said two of the three boys
were kicked off the football team.
"While education is a fun-
damental right, participation
in sports is a privilege," he
explained.
LONDON

Britain's Iron
Lady laid to rest
with full pomp
Margaret Thatcher was laid
to rest Wednesday with prayers
and ceremony, plus cheers and
occasional jeers, as Britain
paused to remember a leader
who transformed the country
- for the better according to
many, but in some eyes for the
worse.
Soaring hymns, Biblical verse
and fond remembrances echoed
under the dome of St. Paul's
Cathedral, as 2,300 relatives,
friends, colleagues and digni-
taries attended a ceremonial
funeral for Britain's only female
prime minister.
Queen Elizabeth II, current
and former prime ministers and
representatives from 170 coun-
tries were among the mourners
packing the cathedral, where
Bishop of London Richard Char-
tres spoke of the strong feelings
Thatcher still evokes 23 years
after leaving office.

EDUCATION
From Page 1A
approval until after the state
budget is agreed upon.
Education Prof. Steve Des-
Jardins said it's unlikely that
the University will raise tuition.
"There's political pressure
to not raise tuition to try to
make up the difference," Des-
Jardins said. "There are really
two strategies: They could try
to raise revenues in another
way or bring in revenues from
another source - development
or by raising tuition - or they
could tryto reduce their outlays
in some way, or both."
DesJardins added that anoth-
er feasible source of revenue for
the University could be dipping
into its endowment, which is the
largest of any public university
at $7.7 billion as of June 30, 2012.
However, when faced with
similar budget cuts during the
2011-2012 academic year the
University decided not to use its
endowment money and instead
raised in-state tuition by 6.7
percent and out-of-state tuition
by 4.9 percent.
Political Science Prof Mike
Traugott said if there are bud-
get cuts, they might not be as
extreme as $47 million due to
compromises between state
Republicans and Democrats.
"There's some possibility
there could be no reduction in
the budget, or that in negotia-
tions between the House and
the Senate the cuts would be
reduced substantially," Trau-
gott said. "If it turns out the
Republicans, especially in the
House, have to make a deal with
some Democrats, the Demo-
crats will ask for some things
in exchange, which could be a
reduction in the amount of the
penalty orthe elimination of it."
Traugott added that if there
are cuts made, he hopes that
"individual units would be
given some discretion" by the

Universityto best decide how to
cut things from their programs.
DesJardins said it is unlike-
ly that the University will
cut straight across the board
because they haven't done so in
the past.
He said this House bill is just
a political move to punish the
institutions that acted before
right to work went into effect.
"Somebody over in Lansing
is ticked off about the fact that
it looks like the institutions
were operating in bad faith by
the fact that they negotiated
these contracts," DesJardins
said. "It might not ever go any-
where. Yet, whoever introduced
this will be able to say to their
constituents, 'Look, I tried to do
something but it didn't work."'
Traugott agreed that the bill
is "a kind of political statement."
He said the contracts were most
likely negotiated for economic
reasons, not out of spite.
"Some large administra-
tion units tried to mitigate the
effects of that law by signing
relatively long-term contracts,"
Traugott said. "If the contract
decisions were economically
viable, they don't merit this
kind of response."
In 2006, the University
implemented a new irrigation
system in order to lower costs,
and in an interview with CBS
Local Detroit in 2011 about the
budget cuts for the 2011-2012
academic year, Vice Provost
Martha Pollack said the Uni-
versity would like to continue
cutting costs in this environ-
mentally friendly way.
Whatever the cuts may be,
the University says it will strive
to keep its academic reputation.
"Cost containment has
focused on improving the effi-
ciency of delivery of admin-
istrative and operational
support, while protecting the
core academic activities of
the university," the University
said in an article on the Record
Online.

form called playVS, and this is the
first touch-point ever," Josh Wein-
stein, a member of the playVS
team, said. "Right now, we're con-
ducting a pilot between Michigan
and MSU, and we basically wantto
bring like-minded people together
while also fostering the rivalry
because people love competition."
Weinstein said the basic concept
of playVS involves creating a gam-
ing community - in this case the
University - to compete against a
rival community for a prize. PlayVS
plans to award 10,000 Klondike
bars to the winningschool.
"This is something that's fun
and engaging, because it allows
people to suit up themselves and
get in the game," Weinstein said.

the course of the evening - more
than he was anticipating. On aver-
age, Bernstein had to answer two
to three tweets per minute tokeep
pace with the incoming ones.
Many of the early tweets
focused on the renovation of the
recreational centers on campus
and the Michigan Union. The
regents first discussed the issue
at their November meeting, when
they considered what kind of fee
would be acceptable to finish the
renovation while keeping costs
down. The "Building a Better
Michigan" campaign initially
called for a fee between $100 and
$200 per student per semester to
complete the renovations, but the
regents later balked at the figure.
Business junior Michael
Proppe, president-elect of CSG,
asked Bernstein whether he con-
sidered a $65 per semester fee
acceptable for the project.
"I think $65 per semester is a
good deal. What do you think?"
Bernstein tweeted.
LSA junior Sasha Shaffer, vice
president of Maize Rage, tweeted
back, "compared to other big ten
schools that is way low They have
far superior facilities and will
continue (to) if it is $65."
In an interview after the
event, Bernstein said the regents
are continuing negotiations and
he expected action as soon as

the sport and cheer for the bas-
ketball team or the football team.
PlayVS allows students to actually
play on behalf of their school, and
everybody gets to contribute with
a tangible prize at the end."
Currently, the University has
156 registered players as com-

"There's no doubt that private
sources of funding have sup-
ported this University through
difficult times and enabled us to
think about these projects," Ber-
nstein said. "The unions and the
rec centers should be included in
any fundraising activities that the
University engages in, but we also
know that the type of support that
we need to do these projects takes
a very longtime to obtain."
He added that the University
does have space on its balance
sheet to take on more debt to
finance renovations.
In a tweet addressing college
affordability, Bernstein also stat-
ed publicly for the first time that
the University hopes to raise a
full $1 billion for financial aid in
the capital campaign beginning
this fall.
"Financial aid will be the major
priority in the upcoming cam-
paign," Bernstein said. "My guess
is that is probably the largest
amount ever raised for financial
aid in the history ofcertainly pub-
lic education."
He added that increased state
support and cost containment
would continue to be the Univer-
sity's main tactics to hold down
tuition increases.
"We have to bend the cost curve
for students and their families,"
Bernstein said. "We have done a
good job, but we can do better ...

Crockett said he believes the
most popular part so far has been
the allegiance to continue the in-
state rivalry.
"One surefire way to get people
excited and rallied on this campus
is to say, 'We need to beat Michigan

very sensitive to this issue."
LSA sophomore Marissa Solo-
mon tweeted at Bernstein, asking
about his take on the drive for the
University to divest its endow-
ment from fossil fuels. The Divest
and Invest movement has been
campaigning for the University
to shed the nearly $900 million
worth of stocks and funds invest-
ed in traditional energy stocks.
The total value of the endowment
is nearly $8 billion.
"Interested in learning more
about this," Bernstein tweeted.
"Not sure if this approach is in
the best interest of UM for several
reasons."
Bernstein declined to address
a question about the Coalition for
Tuition Equality and Wednes-
day's protest directly in an inter-
view, but in his tweet he praised
students for being socially active.
"@UMich has long tradition
of student activism. Part of our
history/culture. Proud of this
engagement," Bernstein wrote.
Parikh said he anticipates that
his presidential successor will
try to foster new opportunities
for both regents and university
administrators to engage with
students about topics affecting
the University.
"(Bernstein) really is a stu-
dent's regent," Parikh said. "I
think it sends a strong message
to students that the regents are
there for them, are listening io
them, and are actually trying to
engage them."

Obama lambasts
Senate gun vote
as 'shameful day'

Despite recent
setback, president
vows to continue
gun control efforts
WASHINGTON (AP) - A
visibly infuriated President
Barack Obama surrounded
himself with tear-stained
parents of Connecticut school
shooting victims Wednes-
day after the Senate voted
down a measure designed to
keep guns out of the hands
of criminals and declared it
a "pretty shameful day for
Washington."
The Senate, which is con-
trolled by the president's own
party, handed him a stinging
first defeat for his second term
by voting down a bipartisan
compromise to expand back-
ground checks for gun buy-
ers. The disappointment was
all over the faces of Obama
and Vice President Joe Biden,
their mouths turned into deep
frowns as they appeared in the
Rose Garden shortly after the
vote.
"The fact is most of these
senators could not of offer any
good reason why we wouldn't
want to make it harder for
criminals and those with sever-
al mental illness to buy a gun,"
Obama said. "There were no
coherent arguments as to why
we wouldn't do this."
Obama vowed that the vote
would not end his fight for
stricter gun laws and was "just
round one." But it's unclear
where the White House and its
allies on guns can go from here,
after the Senate sunk their best
hope.
With five Democrats vot-
ing along with 41 Republicans
against the measure, Obama
didn't spare his own party
the blame. He said opponents
made a political calculation
that the gun lobby and a vocal
minority of gun owners would
come after them in the next
election.
"Obviously a lot of Republi-
cans had that fear, but Demo-

crats had that fear, too," Obama
said. "And so they caved to the
pressure and started looking
for an excuse, any excuse, to
vote no."
The pointed accusations
were a marked departure from
Obama's "no drama" style. He's
shown a lot of passion on the
gun issue, even publicly shed-
ding tears, but his emotion was
previously appeared more root-
ed in sadness than anger.
He made persistent calls
over the past few months for
senators simply to allow a
vote to honor the 26 victims
from Sandy Hook Elementary
School and those killed in other
mass shootings. After that
vote, he appeared before cam-
eras flanked relatives of five
children killed at Sandy Hook
along with former Rep. Gabby
Giffords, shot in the head two
years ago while meeting with
her Arizona constituents.
Mark Barden, whose lost
his 7-year-old son, Daniel,
introduced the president and
said the families would return
home "disappointed but not
defeated," with determination
that change will come.
"Our hearts are broken.
Our spirit is not," Barden said,
as Obama put his hand on
his shoulder. Throughout the
appearance, some of the par-
ents cried and were embraced
by Biden, Obama's point man
on the issue.

Time to build a better Michigan
Regents should support recreational facilities renovation
At the May 16 meeting of the University's Board of Regents, the
Building a Better Michigan campaign will push the University
to embark upon a multi-year renovation of University unions
and recreational facilities. Though the project's expected cost isn't
cheap - an estimated $135 million on improvements - it's a necessary
undertaking. Recent reports from the architecture firm Integrated
Design Solutions confirm the poor conditions of the unions and gyms
and the inadequate resources they offer the student body. From crum-
bling tiles in the showers of the Central Campus Recreation Building to
the insufficient meeting spaces in the Michigan Union, the BBM has a
proposal to address serious flaws of common facilities on campus. The
regents should support the proposal and student facilities upgrades,
reaffirming the board's commitment to quality buildings supporting a
quality campus.

"Got any spare change today?"
This is a familiar question to stu-
dents who live in houses or apart-
ments in greater Ann Arbor, away
from the cozy confines of the Uni-
versity's campus. It tends to come
from the lips of older men or women
wearing shabby-looking clothes,
often sounding like an admission of
defeat or a pushy sales pitch instead
of a question. Its responses are
many, including the snap-decision
yes, the harried no, and silence, as
the questioned person walks past
the questioner looking anywhere
but into their eyes.
Though it might as well mean
no, what silence means in this
context isn't entirely clear. Does
it signal that a passerby considers
himself to be above speaking to
someone so obviously at the bot-
tom of the socioeconomic heap or
that the passerby fears speaking to
such a person? That the passerby
doesn't have any change, or at least
any that she's willing to give to a
homeless person? Or does it sim-
ply indicate a lack of words - the
passerby's uncertainty about how
to answer the question given all
that it implies? For better or worse,
each person who stays silent prob-
ably has at least one of these things
in mind. Regardless, no is the right
answer to this question.
All charity isn't automatically

re no change

good or even effective. Look at it
this way: Giving a dollar to some-
one who is panhandling is kind
of like voting for a candidate dur-
ing an election. It makes the giver
feel good about him or herself and
indicates his or her sympathy for
that person or candidate, but the
chances of that contribution being
the difference between life and
death - in a political or actual
sense - is infinitesimally small. In
Ann Arbor, this wellspring of flam-
ing liberalism, a student could also
be excused for thinking that some-
one else will make a contribution,
making any change given person-
ally seem futile.
There's an important difference
between a vote and a dollar bill
given out on the street - account-
ability. A vote for a political candi-
date creates an obligation for him or
her to pay attention to your desires
as a constituent or risk defeat in the
next election. No such mechanism
exists for ensuring that a person
spends donated money in a respon-
sible manner.
Intuitively, or perhaps stereotyp-
ically, there's a more-than-decent
chance that giving a dollar to a pan-
handler isn't going toward acquir-
ing a place of residence, paying for
cancer treatments for his or her
sick child or putting a down pay-
ment on a car. This intuition plays

out depressingly well in practice:
According to the Department of
Housing and Urban Development,
60 percent of homeless people have
problems with drugs or alcohol. To
me, that's more than enough reason
not to give money to anyone on the
street who asks for it.
Now before you label me a heart-
less bastard for assuming that
every panhandler and homeless
person is a druggie or an alcoholic,
I encourage you to reread that sta-
tistic and consider its implications.
I'm entirely in favor of extending a
helping hand to the extremely poor
and homeless people, regardless
of why they're in such a situation.
However, it's apparent that hand-
outs of change on the street are
more likely to harm than help.
Between that and having no way
to see how spare change is spent,
giving money to panhandlers isn't
something to be recommended.
There are better ways to help out
and make an impact, includingpeti-
tioning government officials to pri-
oritize programs designed to help
extremely poor people get back on
their feet, volunteering at a com-
munity kitchen or giving money to
a charitable organization. Any of
these things can create real change
- spare change cannot.

According to BBM's report, the campus's
recreational sports facilities and unions are
some of the most heavily trafficked buildings
at the University. A survey of 10,000 students
estimated 96 percent of students use the unions
on campus, while 76 percent use recreational
facilities like the CCRB. With high use comes
high wear and tear, and BBM looks to improve
the existing damage and poor designs. The
plan calls for major renovations to the CCRB,
including a 26,000 square-foot addition,
increased workout equipment and air condi-
tioning for the summer months. Under the
proposal, student organization spaces would
expand, with more common space added near
the Union's designated area for student group
offices. As organizations across campus con-
tinue to increase collaborative efforts, the
improvements to the Union's meeting spaces
would allow for more frequent interaction.
Furthermore, the renovations to recreational
facilities can attract prospective students to
campus while enhancing the experience of
current students. No one likes a crowded gym.
The proposal seeks funding through a
combination of student fees and University
support. In BBM's plan, a fee of $65 per term
would be added to tuition for the next 30 years.
Compared to other Big 10 schools, this fee is
relatively low: Fees for union and recreation
center improvements at Ohio State University

and the University of Minnesota were more
than twice that. Given the frequent use of the
buildings, along with their deficient states -
the IDS reported that all three unions were in
"poor conditions" in 2008 - the comparatively
moderate tuition increase is worth the price.
However, there are several concerns about
the project that must be addressed. If the Uni-
versity decides to spend millions of dollars
on the renovations, then long-term durability
should be a top priority for all facilities. Addi-
tionally, many ofthe buildings being renovated
- notablythe Union and the Intramural Sports
Building - are historical landmarks. Those
buildings' architecture must be preserved to
the greatest extent possible during the reno-
vation. Moreover, the project comes at a time
when it seems construction is occurring on
nearly every block at the University. In order
to ensure that all buildings are usable in the
fall and winter terms, the project must stick to
its commitment to having construction occur
only during summer months.
If the regents approve the project, BBM
must also keep the University community up
to date on its progress. Given the importance of
the University unions and recreational sports
facilities to students, faculty and the greater
Ann Arbor community, this renovation would
be a worthy investment in the future of the
University and student experience.

JOSHUA SCHOSTAK I
Win or lose, always a Wolverine

MAX HELLER |
Reconciling Turkey and Israel

Twenty-one years ago, as a Uni-
versity alum, my dad was in Min-
neapolis, Minn. at the NCAA Final
Four. Twenty-one years later, both
my dad and I were in Atlanta, Ga.,
watching our Wolverines in the
Final Four.
I grew up in Huntington Woods,
Mich. and was raised by my Wol-
verine father and Spartan mother,
so you could say my loyalties
should have been divided; however,
they weren't. I'm a third-genera-
tion Wolverine - my grandfather
attended the University as well.
I grew up on Michigan football.
I bled, and still bleed, maize and
blue. Yet, the absence of a domi-
nant Michigan basketball program
reared its headlights right in my
face. But I had faith.
Former head football coach Lloyd
Carr was my leader. I idolized Heis-
man trophy winner Charles Wood-
son. I watched former wide receiver
Steve Breaston flash down the field
for touchdowns and former running
back Mike Hart relentlessly run
over little brother's football team. I
attended Rose Bowls but never saw
a victory. Only when I was five-years
old Brian Griese led Wolverines won
the national championship in 1997.
All this time, Michigan basketball
was in the rear-view mirror - a
place it'll never be again.
When you're a Wolverine, nothing
is worse than hearing those Spartans
from that school in East Lansing
gloat about their successful basket-
ball program and coach Tom Izzo.
While I went to the Crisler Center
over the years, my childhood was
the Big House. I always dreamed of
attending the University to spend
the best four years of my life as a stu-
dent. In 2010, that dream came true

and with it came somethingI hadn't
witnessed during mytwenty-one
years of life: a Michigan basketball
title run.
I saw the Daniel Hortons, Bernard
Robinson Jrs., Brent Petways and
Tommy Amakers of the past, but as
I stepped foot on this campus, it was
the Zach Novaks and Stu Douglasses
that started what Team 96 finished
for me in Atlanta. Choosing not to
study abroad, one thing driving me
this semester was the potential of
this young, explosive, exciting and
talented Michigan basketball team.
I attended more than 10 games at
Crisler Center this year, watched the
team in one of the coolest college
basketball atmospheres - Assembly
Hall in Bloomington, Ind. - trav-
eled to the Palace of Auburn Hills to
watch the beat down on South Dako-
ta State University and the take-
down of the Shaka Smart-coached
Virginia Commonwealth University
Rams. So it was only perfect that I
stood front row in the student sec-
tion at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta.
While my Spartan mother took
care of me at home in 1992, the
Fab Five was in its Final Four.
Twenty-one years later, I stood in
the Georgia Dome, just a wave of
a hand away from my dad, who sat
with my younger brother. We were
on a business trip to accomplish
something Michigan couldn't before.
Regardless of the outcome, I was
truly livingthe dream - a student
witnessing the resurrection of maize
and blue basketball.
While we didn't win the cham-
pionship, I kept thinking to myself
how surreal it was to watch this spe-
cial season first-hand. My dad texted
me after beating Syracuse University
and said, "Cannot tell you how proud

I am of you and that you're there and
living the U of M college dream."
While our business trip to Atlanta
was somewhat unsuccessful, the
dream is alive and thriving.
As I stood in the Georgia Dome
as the clock hit zero, I was upset and
nearly in tears. I chose to walk back
to my hotel alone and refleet.
I began to think about what
Team 96, head coach John Beilein
and his coaching staff have done
for this University. I thought about
Senior guard Matt Vogrich nailing
a pull-up three in the garbage min-
utes against the University of Flor-
ida, laughed about the hilarious
open dunks Mitch McGary missed
throughout the season, and then
thought about seeing him grow
and help this team get to Atlanta.
Those are just of the few that made
me smile and made me proud to
call myself a Michigan Wolverine.
Every quiet moment I think
about now-former point guard Trey
Burke'sblock on Peyton Siva and
how it could have changed the game.
But then I think about the journey
that got us there and what's tocome
for this program.
Michigan basketball is back,
and I guarantee you it's not going
anywhere.
This past fall semester in English
225, I saw Burke walk into the class.
While he might not remember, I
looked at him and told him, "I'm
happy you stayed because we're
about to ball out this season." That's
exactly what we did.
Twenty-one years ago we were
there, but we left. Twenty-one years
later, we were there, but this time
we're here to stay.

Israel and Turkey have made significant
strides in pursuing reconciliation over the
past month. Last week, the two countries
finally agreed to pursue a normalization of
their diplomatic relations, ending a three-
year freeze that had been in place since the
Gaza flotilla raid in 2010.
The normalization comes after the first
meeting between Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Turkish Prime
Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. During the
meeting, Netanyahu expressed regret and
apologized for operational mistakes during
the flotilla raid that resulted in nine deaths,
including eight Turkish nationals and one
American. Netanyahu's humble words gave
Erdogan reason to communicate with him
further and opened the door for last week's
normalization announcement. Erdogan
demanded Netanyahu's apology as a precon-
dition to any further diplomatic negotiations
between the two nations, and Netanyahu
agreed to meet him in the middle for what
was a seemingly reasonable demand, though
he previously asserted he wouldn't apologize.
Netanyahu's about-face in this instance was
extremely beneficial.
Previously, Erdogan had announced that
Israel's apology for the flotilla raid was enough
on its own to normalize diplomatic rela-
tions. However, he has since added additional
demands as preconditions to further normal-
ization. One issue is restitution payments to the
families of the flotilla incident's victims. Israel
has offered to compensate each family with
payments of $100,000 each - $30,000 more
than Turkey pays its military families who lose
loved ones. Turkey, however, is demanding $1
million per family in restitution payments.
The countries must now negotiate to reach
a resolution on this issue, and it'd be ben-
eficial for Turkey to reevaluate their initial
demand. In the spirit of cooperation and rec-
onciliation that Netanyahu displayed with his
apology, Erdogan should willingly negotiate
a fair amount for the restitution payments,
rather than demanding $1 million per family
U / '

as a deal-breaker for further normalization.
Also at issue is Israel's legal naval block-
ade of Gaza. Israel's navy currently block-
ades Gaza's main port as a security measure.
The Israeli navy inspects incoming ships
to ensure that no weapons or missiles are
brought into Gaza. Hamas often attempts to
smuggle rocket-building materials into Gaza,
and the blockade serves to stifle that effort.
They allow ships bringing food and other
supplies to continue en route to Gaza. Erdo-
gan has announced that he expects Israel to
lift this naval blockade before further nor-
malization between Israel and Turkey.
But not only is the naval blockade com-
pletely unrelated to Turkish sovereignty, it's
a matter of Israeli national security and exists
only to limit violence stemming from Hamas
in Gaza. No country should ever have to com-
promise on a matter of internal national secu-
rity in order to engage in diplomatic relations
with another nation. It's akin to demanding
that one's neighbors remove their picket fence
before agreeing to be friendly with them.
Erdogan should be focused on issues that
involve Israel and Turkey, rather than using
the pursuit of normalization as a bargaining
chip for unrelated issues. Such deviations
from regular negotiations make it difficult for
Israel and Turkey to work together.
Normalization between Israel and Turkey
can have numerous benefits. Together, they
can help resolve Syria's civil war and end
the bloodshed there. Additionally, Turkey
is a natural recipient of Israel's natural gas
exports, given its geographic proximity. Tur-
key needs the energy such imports provide,
and Israel is in need of a trading partner for
its gas. These benefits will stand out among
others should Israel and Turkey find a way
to repair their relationship. The logical next
step in the process is for Turkey to follow the
example Israel has already set during this
reconciliation process by making concessions
and negotiating in good faith.

Regents'report on
tuition equality should
be made public
TO THE DAILY:
In April 2012, University Pro-
vost Phil Hanlon commissioned a
task force of students and senior
administrators to examine the
issue of tuition equality for undoc-
umented students. This measure,
of course, was a reaction to the
overwhelming mobilization of
students, faculty and community
members - both documented and
undocumented - against the uni-
versity's discriminatory tuition
policies. The task force kicked
off what amounted to an official
review of the University's treat-
ment of undocumented Michigan
students with the intent of exam-

ining different policy options and
issuing a recommendation to the
University's Board of Regents.
In March, after almost a year
of research and preparation, the
Task Force on Undocumented Stu-
dents finally published its find-
ings. However, that report wasn't
made public. Rather, the provost's
office sent the report to the execu-
tive officers - including Univer-
sity President Mary Sue Coleman
- who will make the final recom-
mendations to the regents without
student input.
Regardless of one's views on
tuition equality, the administra-
tive process undertaken by the
executive officers is alarming.
Coleman has precluded students'
voices from determining the rec-
ommended course of action under
a disturbing lack of transpar-
ency. It's perhaps reasonable to
assume this is the University's

way of shirking its responsibility
to Michigan students; as the Daily
has reported, Coleman prefers not
to address directly immigration-
related issues at the University
Meanwhile, the state's estimat-
ed 29,000 undocumented students
bear the costs of bureaucratic cow-
ardice. Like past actions organized
by the Coalition for Tuition Equal-
ity, the demonstration on April 18
at the regents' meeting serves to
remind University leaders of the
groundswell of support for immi-
grants' rights in Ann Arbor and
across the state and nation. As
elected officials learned after the
2012 elections, the time for tuition
equality is now.

JERUSALEM (AP) - Mili-
tants in Egypt's Sinai Penin-
sula fired at least two rockets at
Israel's southern resort town of
Eilat early Wednesday, officials
said, highlighting what Israel
says is a dire security situation
across its border.
Nobody was hurt in the
attack, police said, although
one rocket exploded near the
courtyard of a house. A shad-
owy hard-line Muslim group,
likely based in the Gaza Strip,
claimed responsibility for the
attack.
Police spokesman Micky
Rosenfeld said the remains of
two Grad-style rockets were
found, and bomb experts were
looking for more.
Israeli Prime Minister Ben-
jamin Netanyahu, who was
traveling to London Wednes-
day for the funeral of Britain's
late Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, said he spoke with his
defense minister and discussed
how to respond.
The British Foreign Office
official in charge of Middle
East policy, Alistair Burt, con-
demned the attack.
"I am deeply concerned by
reports of rocket fire into Eilat
in Israel this morning," Burt
said. "People have a right to live
free from terror. Those respon-
sible should be brought to jus-
tice."

Paul Kevin Curtis, 45, was
arrested Wednesday at his home
in Corinth, near the Tennessee
state line about 50 miles north of
Presley's birthplace in Tupelo.
Authorities were waiting for
definitive tests on intercepted
letters that were addressed to
President Barack Obama and
Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss. Pre-
liminary field tests can often
show false positives for ricin.
Ricin is derived from the castor
plant that makes castor oil. There
is no antidote and it's deadliest
when inhaled.
An FBI intelligence bulletin
obtained by The Associated Press
said the two letters were post-
marked Memphis, Tenn.
Both letters said: "To see a
wrong and not expose it, is to

become a silent partner to its
continuance." Both were signed,
"I am KC and I approve this mes-
sage.".
The letters had Washington on
edge in the days after the Boston
Marathon bombing. As authori-
ties scurried to investigate three
questionable packages discov-
ered in Senate office buildings
Wednesday, reports of suspicious
items also came in from at least
three senators' offices in their
home states. The items were
found to be harmless.
In Corinth, a city of about
14,000,policecordonedoffpartof
a subdivision where Curtis lived.
At least five police cars were on
the scene, but there didn't appear
to be any hazardous-material
crews and no neighbors were
evacuated. The one-story, single-
family home is similar to the oth-
ers in the neighborhood, with red
brick with white trim.
Ricky Curtis, who said he was
Kevin Curtis' cousin, said the
family was shocked by the news
of the arrest. He described his
cousin as a "super entertainer"
who impersonated Elvis and
numerous other singers.
"We're all in shock. I don't
think anybody had a clue that
this kind of stuff was weighing
on his mind," Ricky Curtis said in
a telephone interview.
Ricky Curtis said his cousin

had written about problems he
had with a cleaning business
and that he felt the government
had not treated him well, but he
said nobody in the family would
have expected this. He said the
writings were titled, "Missing
Pieces."
A MySpace page for a clean-
ing company called The Cleaning
Crew confirms thatthey "do win-
dows" and has profile photo of
"Kevin Curtis, Master of Impres-
sions." A YouTube channel under
the name of Kevin Curtis has
dozens of videos of him perform-
ing as different famous musi-
cians, including Elvis Presley,
Buddy Holly and Kid Rock.
"As far as him being anti-
government, I'm not going to say
that, but he had some issues with
some stuff that happened with
his cleaning business," the cousin
said.
Multiple online posts on vari-
ous websites under the name
Kevin Curtis refer to the conspir-
acy he claimed to uncover when
working at a local hospital from
1998 to2000.
The author wrote the con-
spiracy that began when he
"discovered a refrigerator full
of dismembered body parts &
organs wrapped in plastic in the
morgue of the largest non-metro-
politan healthcare organization
in the United States of America."

investigating the attack.
"It is one of Egypt's basic
principles not to endanger the
safety and security of any coun-
try, either those sharing borders
with it or others," said Omar
Amer, spokesman for Egyptian
President Mohammed Morsi.
"Egypt is a state that calls for
peace and preserves it."
Israeli officials have grown
increasingly jittery about the
situation in Egypt since the
ouster of President Hosni
Mubarak in 2011. Islamic mili-
tant groups, some believed to be
affiliated with the al-Qaida ter-
ror network, have taken advan-
tage of a power vacuum in the
lawless Sinai and have carried
out a string of rocket attacks
and other operations along the
border.
The deadliest was in August
2011, when militants from Sinai
rushed into Israel, ambush-
ing Israeli buses and cars with
gunfire and a bomb, killing
eight Israelis. During the melee,
Israeli forces killed six Egyp-
tian policemen. Israel later
apologized for their deaths.
Israel believes militants
from the Gaza Strip, which also
borders Sinai, are also operat-
ing in the area. Israel's military
chief, Lt. Gen. Benny Gantz, has
said security in southern Israel
from threats in Sinai is a high
priority. The regime change in
Egypt, now governed by the
Muslim Brotherhood, has not
damaged cooperation between
the countries' security forces,
he added.
"Coordination even improved
in certain aspects," he said
Tuesday. Senior Defense Minis-
try official Amos Gilad repeated
that on Wednesday, after the
rocket attack.
Israel has increased surveil-
lance along the Egyptian bor-
der over the past two years, and

is building a barrier along the
230-kilometer (150-mile) fron-
tier to keep out militants and
African migrants.
Reflecting the concerns,
the military moved a battery
of its new "Iron Dome" rocket
defense system into Eilat earlier
this month.
Although air-raid sirens went
off during Wednesday's attack,
the military said the system,
which is meant to fire when
rockets are headed toward pop-
ulated areas, was not activated.
It cited "operational circum-
stances" but did not elaborate.
Danny Lahav of Eilat's Cham-
ber of Commerce told Israel's
Channel 2 TV that he heard the
sound of a "faint explosion" in
the morning, followed by two
louder explosions. Residents in
the popular tourist destination
remained calm, he said, adding
that he hopes the attack won't
dissuade visitors.
Israeli media said there were
reports rockets had also hit the
tourist city of Aqaba in neigh-
boring Jordan, next to Eilat,
but Jordanian Interior Minister
Hussein Majali told The Associ-
ated Press that "no rockets" fell
in Jordan.
A senior Egyptian military
intelligence official in Sinai said
the army was investigating the
incident. He said investigators
were looking into the possibility
of strikes launched from south-
ern Sinai, around the popular
tourist area of Taba along the
Red Sea and nearby mountain-
ous areas.
The group that claimed
responsibility for firing the
rockets said it was a response
to the death of a Palestinian
prisoner from cancer in an
Israeli jail last month. It also
claimed responsibility for
rocket fire out of Gaza a few
weeks ago.

Pakistan sees first
transgender candidate

Historic election
marks progress
for transgender
community
KARACHI, Pakistan (AP)
- When Bindiya Rana, a trans-
gender candidate in Pakistan's
elections, went door to door in
the Karachi slum she hopes to
represent, few people seemed
to care about which gender she
identifies with. They were more
interested in what she was
going to do to combat the street
crime and electricity outages in
their neighborhood if elected.
For the first time in Paki-
stan's history, transgender
people are running as candi-
dates. The development marks
a sign of progress for transgen-
der people in this conservative
country, where they have long
been met by abuse.
Transgender refers to peo-
ple who present themselves to
the world in a way that does
not correspond with their sex
at birth. In Pakistan, that usu-
ally means people born as men
who now dress like women and
wear makeup. They identify as
a "third gender" rather than as
male or female but usually ask
to be referred to by the femi-
nine pronoun since there is no
third-gender pronoun.
Rana has always been active
in her community, and works at
an organization that helps pro-
mote the rights of transgender
people as well as street children

and other social issues. But
after a Supreme Court ruling
in 2011 allowed members of the
transgender community to get
national identity cards recog-
nizing them as a separate iden-
tity - neither male or female
- and allowing them to vote,
she decided to run for office as
well.
She's vying for a provincial
assembly seat in the May 11
national elections.
"People ask if we will win or
lose in the elections. But I won
when my nomination papers
were submitted," she said.
The Supreme Court's deci-
sion didn't explicitly say that
transgender people could run
for office, but by getting the
identity cards and the right
to vote the road was opened
for them. Before the court's
decision, transgender people
could get identity cards only
if they identified themselves
as men.
Almas Boby, president of the
Pakistan Shemale Foundation,
which advocates for members
of the transgender community,
said she knows of at least five
transgender candidates tak-
ing part in the elections. Two,
including Rana, are running in
the southern port city of Kara-
chi, and one each from the cities
of Jehlum, Gujrat, and Sargod-
ha in Punjab province.
"The Supreme Court of Paki-
stan gave us our rights. Now
transgendered people are also
contesting elections, and our
thousands of people will vote
for them," Boby said.

"If our people manage to
reach assemblies, we will get a
better treatment in society," she
said.
Male and female roles are
clearly defined in Pakistan, and
transgender people often face
harassment and abuse - even
from their own families. Some
are pushed out of the home
when they are young and end
up prostituting themselves to
earn a living.
One role where they are tol-
erated is as dancers at weddings
and other celebrations at which
men and women are strictly
segregated. In between the
dancing and showers of rupee
notes, they must fend off grop-
ing from drunken guests.
They can also be seen beg-
ging for money in the streets,
wearing female dress and
makeup. Many earn money by
blessing newborn babies, which
reflects a widespread belief in
Pakistan and other South Asian
nations that God answers the
prayers of someone born under-
privileged.
Rana herself faced harass-
ment from her own family,
when she started to realize at
the age of 12 that she was differ-
ent than the other kids around
her. When she was 14, she ran
away from home and found
work dancing at weddings and
celebrations.
Running for office - and the
possibility of actually serving
in office - is a way to highlight
the role of transgender people
in Pakistan, said many of the
candidates.

STUCK
From Page 1A
dents were "risking arrest" to
demand in-state rates for Michi-
gan's undocumented residents.
At about $12,000 per year, in-
state tuition is nearly $28,000 less
than out-of-state rates.
One of the protestors, Mari-
sol Ramos, a Public Policy and
Education graduate student, said
although previous protests were
successful in making the issue
salient, they were not able to
achieve tangible action withinthe
past year.
"It's our first opportunity for
the more confrontational tactic,"
Ramo said. "We're hoping this
action creates a sense of urgen-
cy in the same way this issue is
urgent to undocumented immi-
grants living in the state and
across the country."
Ramos was later arrested.
Members of the University's
Coalition for Tuition Equality
participated in the event to sup-
port One Michigan, although the
two groups are not affiliated. The
event occurred as administra-
tors continue to discuss possible
changes to University residency
policy.
University Police spokeswom-
an Diane Brown said the UMPD
dispatch center received several
calls at about 6:28 p.m. - includ-
ing one from a University bus
driver - after the students went
into the street.
"Several chose to comply, and
these eight got arrested," Brown
said. "They were very cooperative
- they were arrested, brought
to our office, processed and
released."
Brown said charges against the
students won't be clear until pros-
ecutors review the case, but could
include disorderly conduct, dis-
obeying a police officer or imped-
ing traffic. When asked whether
prosecutors could choose to dis-
miss the case, she said it's "pos-
sible, but hard to say," noting that
the students were clearly disobey-
ing the law.
"They're making a statement,
they get the consequences,"
Brown said.
Brown could not speak to
whether the students could face
consequences from the office of
Student Conflict Resolution, the
Office of the Dean of Students or
any other non-law-enforcement
disciplinary agency, but said
UMPD does not serve as a com-
plainant to those units.
Brown said today's protest
will not likely affect security at
the April 18 University Board of
Regents meeting, as a security
plan has already been put in place,
despite reports that groups will
demonstrate at that meeting.
The most recent large-scale
arrest of student protesters
occurred in 2007, when 12 stu-
dents were arrested for refusing
to leave the office of University
President Mary Sue Coleman.
The students wanted Coleman
to implement stricter labor
standards for companies that
produce Univesity-licensed
apparel. Similar to today, stu-
dents were released that night
after being processed at DPS
headquarters.
Prior to the event, Mersol-Barg
said CTE is "humbled" to "stand
in solidarity" with One Michigan,

as echoed in a statement from
CTE in support of the nonviolent
civil disobedience.
Before taking to the streets,
three local youth said they were
unable to attend the University
due to the tuition policy shared
their stories to inspire the crowd
before the march.
Javier Contreras, a senior
at Skyline High School in Ann
Arbor, was admitted to the Uni-
versity but remains unsure if he
can attend due to the high cost as
an undocumented student. Con-
treras was born in Mexico, but
has lived in the city since he was
four years old.
"It astonishes me that this so-
called prestigious institute refus-
es to give some of the great minds
of the future a chance to succeed,"
Contreras said. "The time is now
for the University of Michigan to
pass tuition equality."
As an undocumented resi-
dent of Michigan, Contreras was
unable to go to Europe with his
high school or to get a driver's
license. Upon acceptance to the
University, Contreras said his
excitement immediately dwin-
dled upon realizing he wouldn't
be able to afford tuition.
University spokeswoman Kelly
Cunningham said the protesters'

approach will not likely impede
administrator's discussions with
CTE.
"The University absolutely
respects the rights to protest and
express their views," Cunning-
ham said.
After the speakers shared their
stories, the protesters marched
to President Coleman's house on
South University Avenue, shout-
ing, "Education not segregation."
When protesters moved to the
intersection of State Street and
South University Avenue, imme-
diately clogging traffic, horns
blared and drivers yelled out car
windows. Some drivers supported
the protest, but yelled for them to
clearthe road.
As she put her car in park, a
driver stalled by the protest said
she wasn't in a rush.
"I'm a little bit frustrated;
I totally support what they're
doing," she said. "I just don't real-
ly know what to do right now. I
almost got out of my car and stood
with them."
The driver added thatit seemed
the protest signs which alluded to
the feeling of undocumented stu-
dents feeling "stuck," mirrored
the unpassable position of the
drivers.
For about 10 minutes, the first
officers on the scene directed
traffic around the protestors. As
more University Police and Ann
Arbor Police approached the
group, protesters moved to the
sidewalk to avoid being arrested
while some - included the eight
arrested - sat in the street, wait-
ing to be handcuffed.
Before getting arrested, LSA
junior Ramiro Alvarez said he
believes the University should
address the tuition issue with
urgency.
"I just think it's absurd," Alva-
rez said. "I'll risk whatever privi-
lege I have for their sake because
I have family who can't come here
because of this."
Social Work alum Marcha
Valabez held her spot on the cor-
ner of the white, decorated cloth
protesters sat on as officers went
around to each person asking if
they were sure they wanted to
go through with an arrest. As
each protester nodded, the officer
provided a pat on the shoulders
before clicking on handcuffs.
"I was nervous at first, I was
hesitant at first. But at the end of
the day, I'm not afraid, because
there are kids and families living
in fear everyday of getting taken
away," Valabez said.
Thirty seconds later, Valabez
was handcuffed and led to a near-
by squad car.
At UMPD headquarters, the
arrested individuals were greet-
ed by a crowd of proud support-
ers and representatives from the
National Lawyers Guild, who
observed the event to ensure that
the students' legal rights were
being respected.
LSA senior Luz Meza said she
took the arrest for the thousands
of undocumented students who
are not able to attend the Univer-
sity and other institutions that
do not offer in-state tuition to
them.
"I would do it again if I had to,"
Meza said. "Knowing that I'm
here at the University and thatI'm
able to lobby the University while
other students who don't have the
opportunity to come here, I feel
extremely privileged."

Meza was concerned about the
idea of having a criminal record,
but said it was outweighed by the
benefits.
"I think we all worried about
that, but what is my career when
other people can't have one?"
Meza said.
LSA freshman Ryne Menhen-
nick was the lone first-year stu-
dent arrested in the group.
"I think that civil disobedience
is a respectable thing," Menhen-
nick said, adding that his parents
would probably be proud of his
actions.
Mersol-Barg, co-founder of the
Coalition for Tuition Equality and
a past Central Student Govern-
ment presidential candidate, said
he was proud to be arrested for an
issue he has fought for a signifi-
cant amount of his time here at
the University.
"I would do it again, because
until the University ends its dis-
criminatory policies towards
undocumented students, I can't
stand for them. I'm going to sit
down and protest for however
long it takes," Mersol-Barg said.
Mersol-Barg said the fact that
campus leaders like himself were
willing to be arrested in protest
of the University administration
should show the urgency of the

issue.
"Mary Sue Coleman is going to
have a lot hardertime sayingnonto
someone that I think people look
to - I have a lot of credibility in
the campus community," he said.
The Coalition for Tuition
Equality has been active since it
began in fall 2011, but hasn't taken
as radical of a step as One Michi-
gan did with Wednesday's disrup-
tive protest. Mersol-Barg said he
was impressed but not surprised
by One Michigan's initiative.
"They are across the nation
protesting these really obscene
policies," Mersol-Barg said. "I'm
just humbled by the fact that
they've organized here on cam-
pus and that I had an opportunity
to sit with them."
Alvarez, the next leader of the
Coalition for Queer People of
Color at the University, became a
U.S. citizen in 2009 and enrolled
in the University in 2010. For him,
the protest was personal.
"I was really lucky, in that year,
to get my papers together," Rome-
ro said. "But if that wasn't the
case, I wouldn't be here."
Alvarez hopes the protest sent
a message to the Board of Regents
and the people of the state of
Michigan about the urgency of
enacting tuition equality.
"If people are this pissed off
and this willing to wage the privi-
leges theyhave...it's finals time -
I'm busy, I have things to do, but
this is worth that time. I hope it
makes a statement," he said.
"I understand that the Univer-
sity is taking a big risk by allowing
undocumented students to come,
but this is an issue of human-
ity, and it's absolutely racist, dis-
criminatory, elitist and classist, to
not allow someone that's been in
Michigan almost their entire life
access to one of the most amazing
institutions in the world."
LSA junior Yonah Lieberman
- who is a former Daily colum-
nist - said today's protest should
show Coleman and the regents
that action needs to be taken.
"It shows how dramatic the
issue is, how urgent the issue is,"
Lieberman said, noting that if
the regents pass tuition equality
tomorrow, Contreras - the Sky-
line High School senior- would
be able to attend the University.
"Every single day that we don't
have tuition equality is a day that
students like Javier are forced to
pay out-of-state tuition and are
effectively barred from the Uni-
versity of Michigan," Lieberman
added.
Though his arrest could be
noticed in future job interviews,
Lieberman said he's not con-
cerned about what problems the
arrest might cause.
"The struggles that I might
face for having this on my
record are nothing compared
to the struggles of the 29,000
undocumented students who
are desperate to come to this
University or their families,
who are everyday worried about
getting raided by (Immigrations
and Customs Enforcement),"
Lieberman said.
When asked what he would say
to Coleman, Lieberman said she
needs to publicly support tuition
equality.
"She knows that's the right thing
to do," Lieberman said. "She knows
that if she supported it, the regents
would support it. So I would tell
her that the time has come for you

to come out and tell us and tell the
world and tell these 29,000 undoc-
umented students that tuition
equality is the right thing to do, the
just thing to do and the thing that
the University should do to be the
Leaders and the Best."

test organized by One Michigan
- a Detroit-based organization
led by undocumented youth .
Public Policy senior Kevin Mer-
sol-Barg - co-founder of CTE,
one of the arrested students
in the protests, a drafter of the
report to the Regents and cur-
rent Daily columnist - said the
event served as a precursor for
the protest to come.
"This will be a catalyst for
people's interest, people's
willingness to put them-
selves out there in solidarity
with undocumented students
tomorrow," Mersol-Barg said.
"Seeing the inspiring actions
today, I think they'll come
even more so than they other-

wise would."
Jose Franco, the event orga-
nizer for One Michigan, said
he applauds CTE's efforts to
persuade the regents chang-
ing University policy. While
their protests have not result-
ed in a response, Franco said
he hopes this one will help
CTE's cause.
"We've been hearing that
there's possibly a vote tomorrow
on that policy change, so we're
trying to use this to pressure
the University to change their
stance," Franco said.
During his Twitter Town
Hall Wednesday night, Regent
Mark Bernstein (D-Ann Arbor)
praised this protesters.
"UMich has long tradition
of student activism. Part of our
history/culture. Proud of this
engagement," Bernstein tweet-
ed.

Thursday, April 18, 2013 - 7A
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily after the Town
Hall, Bernstein, who has pre-
viously expressed support for
tuition equality, declined to
comment on the possibility of
the issue surfacing at the meet-
ing.
"This is a matter of great
urgency," Bernstein said. "This
affects students and their fami-
lies in a profound way, and every
day that we don't address this is
another day we miss the oppor-
tunity to attract the best stu-
dents in the state."
Before LSA sophomore
Ramiro Alvarez was arrested in
yesterday's protests, he said he
would be attending the meeting,
if possible.
"Hopefully I'll be at the meet-
ing if I don't spend too much
time in jail."

Hardaway declares for NBA Draft

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Editor
On Wednesday, junior guard
Tim Hardaway Jr. announced
that he plans to join sophomore
point guard Trey Burke in enter-
ing the 2013 NBA Draft by forgo-
ing his final year of eligibility.
In a decision he reached Tues-
day - one he said "felt good
to just*get off my shoulders"
- Hardaway emphasized that
either decision had its obvious
advantages.
"It was tough to make that
decision because you have a
chance to come back for your
senior year and have a chance
to do something special," Hard-
away said. "It was a win-win situ-
ation in my eyes, I just tried to go
with what my gut was feeling and
where my heart was at."
Ultimately, he couldn't pass
up on the dream he's had since
he was a child when he used to
watch his father, Tim Hardaway
Sr., a former NBA All-Star.
"He knows what's in front of
him better than anybody, prob-
ably, what's in front of him, and
he's ready for it," said Michigan
coach John Beilein.
Draftexpress.com, one of the
most credible pre-draft player
ranker, tabbed Hardaway as its
No. 58 prospect, which would
place him near the tail-end of the
60-pick NBA Draft.
With Burke out next year,
Hardaway would've had a chance
to reassume the role of Michi-
gan's top scoring threat, which he
had as a freshman. But increas-
ing his draft stock could've been
difficult. NBA teams, especially
those picking outside the top
of the first round, are known
for drafting based on potential.
Hardaway has played three years
averaging more than 30 minutes
per game meaning NBA teams
have an idea of his ceiling.
Assistant coach LaVall Jordan,
who said he expects to receive
calls from NBA scouts and team

said. "I think we can be very flex-
ible in a lot of different ways.
"You can put him anywhere
out on the court, probably one
through four.... We like that flex-
ibility being able to do that."
But while the Wolverines can
turn to talent both from their
bench and recruiting class, aglar-
ing leadership void has emerged
for what will be an even young-
er team than this year's, which
was already one of the nation's
youngest. Michigan loses its five
seniors to graduation, including
captain Josh Bartelstein, in addi-
tion to its two other captains,
Burke and Hardaway.
Hardaway seemed to be
caught off guard when asked who
would fill the leadership role, as
he paused, shook his head and
then laughed, as if to say, 'That's
a good question.'
"I don't know, I guess Jordan
Morgan," Hardaway said. "He's
very, very smart and very capable
of being that guy, him and Jon
Horford."
But assistant coach Bacari
Alexander took a firmer, more
confident approach to his vision
for the team's leadership.
"In the departure of other
players, whether it'd be the con-
cerns that people had two years
ago of, 'How do you replace a
Zack Novak and Stu Douglass,'
then you fast forward, 'How do
you replace a Tim Hardaway and
Trey Burke,' but you know, guys
like Jordan Morgan and guys
like Jon Horford are chomping
at the bit to get that opportuni-
ty," Alexander said. "When you
have guys like Jon Horford and
Jordan Morgan that have been
through the battles and the wars,
they tend to rise naturally to that
role."
Hardaway, like Burke, prom-
ised Beilein that along with stay-
ing in school for the remainder of
this semester, he'd return at some
point to graduate. Beilein said
that both players are "in great
academic standing."

PAUL SHERMAN/Daily
Juniorguard Tim Hardaway Jr. is forgoing his final year of eligibility in Ann Arbor toenter the 2013 NBA Draft. He is projected as an early second-round pick.

officials inquiring about Hard-
away, said he'd fully endorse his
player.
"You come to college to be able
to be able to live your dream one
day," Jordan said. "I believe in
Tim Hardaway. There's a reason
we've won 76 games since he's
been here.
"Tim's got one of the best work
ethics I've ever seen. He pre-
pares as well as anyone I've ever
coached."
Hardaway said he sought the
advice of his father - an NBA
scout for the Miami Heat - as
well as Burke and former team-
mate Darius Morris, who left
after his sophomore season when
Hardaway was a freshman.
But the Miami native didn't
pay much attention to the draft
projections, most of which tab
him asa late second rounder.
"All the projections, they do

mean something, but ... I'm ready,
I'm ready to go and I feel ready,"
Hardaway said. "I'm positive
about myself and very, very con-
fident about myself.
"I believe I'm going in the first
round. I believe in myself, I'm
going in the first round in my
mind and ... it was my decision,
it wasn't nobody else's decision.
I feel like I made the right one."
Hardaway's three seasons in
Ann Arbor were each hindered
by shooting inconsistencies,
including a 30.1-percent clip from
the field in his final four games
of this year's NCAA Tourna-
ment. But the junior made stark
improvements in other areas of
his game over this year. While
his scoring dropped slightly this
season, his assist, rebound and
shooting numbers improved
upon his sophomore campaign.
And while it doesn't show up in

the stat book, Hardaway trans-
formed from a defensive liability
into a solid perimeter defender,
often taking the responsibility
for guarding the opposition's top
offensive guard or wing.
"There are several times we
won games because we said,
'Okay Tim, you've got that
guy now,' " Beilein said. "I feel
he's ready if he feels he's ready
because you can't - the one mis-
take we never want to make is a
kid coming back here wishing
he was playing somewhere else.
With everything that Michigan
gives to young men, the NBA is
very attractive to him."
Hardaway is the fourth play-
er in Beilein's tenure to depart
Michigan early in favor of the
NBA - following Burke ear-
lier this week, Darius Morris in
2011 and Manny Harris in 2010
- though that list could grow

pending decisions by freshmen
forwards Mitch McGary and
Glenn Robinsonn III, whose
futures are still uncertain.
. Beilein said that because of the
current college basketball land-
scape, he's no longer surprised by
early departures.
"We want what's best for
the young men through and
through," Beilein said. "What we
have to do is always be prepared
for this, and I think we are."
Hardaway's starting position
will likely be filled by incoming
freshman Zak Irvin, a 6-foot-6
guard. Irvin was recently named
Indiana's Mr. Basketball and
given a fifth star by Rivals.com,
who labeled him as the nation's
No. 24 recruit.
Irivin's stature closely resem-
bles Hardaway's, though he may
be a more capable ball handler.
"We like our options," Beilein
