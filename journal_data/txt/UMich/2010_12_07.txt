Rex Holland, a professor in the
Medical School and the School of
Dentistry, spoke about the low rate
of minority faculty members on
campus, in a meeting before the
Senate Advisory Committee on Uni-
versity Affairs yesterday.
Holland discussed a study by
SACUA's Multicultural Committee,
which examined the percentages
of minority faculty members using
data compiled from 1994 to 2008.
Holland said the study found that
though the percentage of Asian fac-
ulty members has increased since
the data was collected, the percent-
ages of black and Hispanic faculty
remained unchanged.
There was not enough data on
American Indians and Native Alas-
kans for inclusion in the study, he
said.
The study's charts show that
black faculty members made up
only 4 percent of the professorial

population in 1994, followed by a
small peak in 2002 but a subsequent
decline. The number of Hispanic
faculty was similarly low, with only
2 percent of the faculty identifying
as Hispanic in 1994.
According to Holland, percent-
ages for minority representation
in individual departments varied
widely. Some departments had high
percentages while other depart-
ments had almosteno minority far-
ultymembers.
The study also found that while
recruitment of minority faculty may
have increased, the rate of minor-
ity faculty retention has also gone
down, Holland said.
Though the study was released
in 2008, Holland said he was dis-
appointed that it had not attracted
greater notice from the administra-
tion and other faculty groups.
Biology Prof. John Lehman,
another SACUA member, said he
was confused about the numbers in
the study because there was no indi-
cated value against which they were
measured. He said without a value
to compare the numbers against, it
was hard to discern the true dispari-
ties.
SACUA Chair Ed Rothman said
he was concerned that the num-
bers reflect differences over time

By KYLE SWANSON
Daily News Editor
University President Mary
Sue Coleman publicly addressed
the job security of head football
coach Rich Rodriguez today, say-
ing that any decision regarding
the coach's future is up to Athletic
Director David Brandon.

"I hired a
terrific ath-
letic director,'
Coleman said
at her month-
ly fireside
chat. "And I
said, 'Dave, KYLE SWANSON
this is your
decision.' And
he said, 'Yes,
and I'm going to make a decision.
And I said, 'Great."'
The question came amid recent
media and fan speculation about
Rodriguez's job status after his

first winning season as Michi-
gan's football coach and his third
straight loss to Ohio State.
Some have speculated that
Stanford's football coach and for-
mer Michigan quarterback Jim
Harbaugh would be hired for
the job should it become avail-
able. However, Stanford's Ath-
letic Director Bob Bowlsby said
Sunday that the school offered
Harbaugh a sweetened contract,
which he says the coach has indi-
cated he plans to accept.
Coleman's response to the first
question fueled several students

to ask follow up questions.
Asked whether she was happy
with the overall performance of
the Michigan football team, Cole-
man said all programs have high
points and low points.
"All programs go through tran-
sitions," Coleman said. "You can't
tell me that there's any program
in the country that hasn't had its
ups and downs."
However, Coleman added that
often the bad times seem to last
longer than they actually are.

Fewer students choosing to
enroll in humanities majors

GUNDAY MONDAY

English Department
offers peer mentors
in attempt to boost
participation
By ALYSSA ADLER
For the Daily
With the effects of an eco-
nomic recession and pushy
parents nudging students to con-
sider majors perceived as offer-
ing skills directly applicable to
the job market officials say fewer
students are enrolling in majors
like history or English. But in

an effort to maintain enrollment
and reverse the trend, professors
and administrators are trying to
remind students of the value of a
liberal arts degree.
The history department has
seen a recent drop in student
concentrators, according to
Kathy Evaldson, undergradu-
ate program and student ser-
vices coordinator, for the history
department. Though the depart-
ment doesn't directly assist in
career counseling - it sends stu-
dents to the Career Center - she
said officials still actively encour-
age students to think more open-
ly about future goals.
"I've been in touch with a lot

of alumni," Evaldson said. "I ask
them what they're doing, and
pass that information on to cur-
rent students, just to let (the stu-
dents) know that the sky's the
limit."
Evaldson said the history pro-
gram teaches concentrators how
to think critically, analyze texts,
research and write - skills that
are important in many fields. She
added that history concentra-
tors go on to a variety of careers,
including law, medicine, museum
preservation and everything in
between.

Local business owners say influx of chains a cause for concern

Some say city still
friendly to locally
owned businesses
By ANNA ROZENBERG
Daily StaffReporter
Though the face of Ann Arbor
is changing with independently
owned stores like Shaman Drum
closing up shop and chains like
Five Guys Burgers and Fries
moving in to replace them, local
business owners and leaders in
the State Street and Main Street

areas say they believe the city
will continue to be a thriving hub
full of locally-owned restaurants
and shops.
Maura Thomson, executive
director of the Main Street Area
Association, said Main Street
caters to those looking for high-
end fashion, home decor and
food. She added that the area's
success can be attributed to its
solid businesses and low turn-
over rate.
"We have quite a bit of longev-
ity," she said.
Thomson said that despite the
turbulent economy in the recent

past, the Ann Arbor community
has been consistently supportive
of local businesses.
"The past couple years have
been really tough, but we are
really lucky," Thomson said,
mentioning that this past year
saw an increase in sales for busi-
nesses in the the Main Street
Area Association.
While Main Street establish-
ments continue to attract con-
sumers inrorested in supporting
local businesses, turnover on
State Street may lead to a greater
presence of national and global
chains on campus.

Ed Davidson, owner of Biv-
ouac - an outdoors supplies
store that has been located on
State Street for 37 years - said he.
remembers the campus McDon-
ald's that opened on Maynard
Street in 1976 and hopes that the
fast food restaurant wouldn't
survive today if it re-opened on
campus. Davidson also said he's
concerned about the 7-Eleven
location that will open its doors
at the end of the year on South
State Street in the space formerly
occupied by Ritz Camera.
"In the last few years, it's been
more national chains or regional

chains versus locally owned,"
said Davidson. "I wish it weren't
so."
Davidson said this trend may
be due in part to the inability of
local businesses to compete with
national chains, which generally
have more money at their dispos-
al. Throughout his time on State
Street, Davidson said he has had
to change his products to meet
the evolving demands of his cus-
tomers to remain competitive.
Despite the fact that national
chains like 7-Eleven and CVS/
Pharmacy will be moving to
State Street soon, Davidson said

he's confident Ann Arbor will
remain a vibrant city that is wel-
coming to independently owned
businesses.
"It has a great future because
there's so many people ...
between students and professors
and tourists," said Davidson.
Tom Heywood, executive
director of the State Street Asso-
ciation, agreed saying he still has
faith that Ann Arbor will stay
healthy, regardless of the appar-
ent influx of national chains to
State Street.

A matrimonial myth?

There's a myth on campus that no
hopeless romantic can resist.
According to campus lore, any couple
that kisses under the Engineering Arch
at the stroke of midnight is destined to
marry.
And while the myth is impossible to
prove or disprove, some couples who
have gone on to marry after kissing
under the arch say the legend is more
than just a fairy tale.
For one such couple, Matthew Straw
and Julie Foster-Straw, a 2009 gradu-
ate of the University, the efficacy of the
legend of the Engineering Arch isn't in
doubt.
"It's true!" Julie wrote of the myth in
an e-mail interview last week.
The two met last year while working
at Vinology on Main Street.
Julie said her now-husband knew the
implications of kissing at the spot so he
took her there on the couple's first date
after they ate dinner at Seva on East Lib-

erty Street and saw a show at the Ann
Arbor Comedy Showcase.
"We walked under the arch and he
asked if he could do an 'experiment'
with me," Julie recalled. "We kissed and
it worked! We were married July 15th,
2010."
The couple tried to return to the arch
on the day of their wedding to take pic-
tures while recreating their first kiss
and to commemorate the myth that may
have been responsible for their mar-
riage, but Julie said the weather didn't
cooperate.
"We tried to take pictures there on
our wedding day, but there was a rain
storm right after the ceremony," Julie
wrote.
Matthew and Julie currently live in
Atlanta, where Julie is a graduate stu-
dent at Emory University's School of
Public Health and Matthew is a manager
at a local restaurant and a photographer.

national chains than it does inde-

said.
Heywood added that landlords
always need tenants and national
chains are always looking for good
opportunities, while independent
businesses are also looking for
affordable spaces.
Heywood said he thinks Ann
Arbor businesses are able to sur-
vive in the financial downturn due

to the 60,000 University-affiliated
people who frequent local busi-

Speaking about the challenges
she's faced during her terimo as
president, Coleman, whose con-
tract was recently extended by
the University's Board of Regents,
said the most formidable obstacle
she's dealt with was managing
the University's budget in the
face of an ailing economy.
"This has been a really chal-
lenging time for the state of
Michigan, because we really have
been in a recession for the past 10
years," Coleman said.
But Coleman said this financial
challenge has actually allowed
the University to grow stronger,
because of the management tech-
niques it has in place. She added
that the University is currently
on "as firm of a financial footing
as (it) has ever been."
Coleman also said that in her
upcoming term, she would like to
increase the amount of interna-
tional alumni donations.
"This is going to be an area
that we hope will be fruitful in
the future," Coleman said.

care business, and I've seen his
billboards out on I-94. He's entre-
preneurial," she said.
Susan Parrish, the interim
director of undergraduate stud-
ies for the Department of English
Language and Literature as well
as an associate English profes-
sor, echoed Evaldson's sentiment,
saying English concentrators
learn skills that are applicable to
many careers. According to Par-
rish, many students who major in
English have an interest in fields
such as teaching, publishing and
journalism, especially since the
University doesn't have a specific
school or concentration for
journalism.
"When people think 'English'
they think about things like book
clubs, which are associated with
the after hours of work," Parrish
said. "But in truth, you can build a
career out of almost anything the
English department offers."
However, Parrish said the per-
ception that English is a more rec-
reational major has led to a drop
in enrollment. She added that the
department is looking for ways to
maintain and attract more concen-
trators.
"We are actually currently
undergoing some curricular
changes to address that because
we don't want to lose any concen-
trators," Parrish said. "We're doing
a lot of soul-searching about why
numbers in our concentration are
going down."

The department has already
implemented a few changes to
address the issue. This year for the
first time, two peer advisors are
available to help students. Accord-
ing to Parrish, the English depart-
ment hopes that the student peer
advisors will make students feel
more comfortable coming into the
main office and asking questions
about the department or major.
"We're trying to make students
feel completely welcome," she said.
LSA senior Laura Winnick is
one of the department's two peer
advisors. She said she hopes to
take her English degree to "spac-
es where creativity is important
and prized," including classrooms
and non-profit organizations. She
explained that despite misconcep-
tions, English is extremely practi-
cal beyond the realms of teaching
and writing.
"Even if a job position does not
directly involve inscription, the
crafting of language is crucial to
the act of arguing, the art of being
persuasive, and the ability to pres-
ent oneself," she wrote in an e-mail
interview. "This is what the Eng-
lish major provides its students
with - the ability to write and the
challenge to write well."
In addition to learning valuable
skills, majors in the humanities
also give students the opportunity
to learn about a subject they're
passionate about, according to Tim
Dodd, the director of the Newnan
LSA Academic Advising Center.
"I want people to divorce the
notion of major from the idea of
vocation," Dodd said. "Your major
should be the content area that

going to get even more vibrant in
the next five or six years," said Hey-
wood. "I'm optimistic, you can call
me crazy."
David Jones, owner of White
Market, said that in his 27 years
as owner of the store, he has seen
many businesses come and go in
the State Street and greater down-
town areas. The turnover, he said,
is just part of business.
"Things change all the time,"
Jones said, adding that he has
seen five or six different busi-
nesses occupy the space next to
White Market during his tenure
as manager.
spurs your brain to be smart, so
you might as well choose the con-
tent area that you like, since all the
majors make your brain smart"
Dodd added that regardless of
their major, students gain useful
tools for a variety of jobs.
"All majors bequeath the same
things," Dodd said, "Content may
be different, but the skills that
you use to acquire that content are
pretty similar across all majors."
LSA senior Marissa Kresch said
she hopes to use her major in phi-
losophy and her minor in Program
in the Environment to become
involved in urban farming and the
ethics of food quality, but she said
she thinks philosophy is more than
just a path that leads to a specific
job.
"If you come to college and view
college as a professional train-
ing ground with no intention of
becoming a professor or a philoso-
pher, then I would say that philoso-
phy is not practical,"she said. "But
if you view college as preparation
for the world or the impact you
intend to make, then I say philoso-
phy is a very practical major."
Though Dodd noted the impor-
tance of finding a major that best
suits one's interests and talents, he
says students shouldn't be "mind-
less" about picking their major.
"Just waving a Michigan diplo-
madoesn'tgetyou ajob, but careful
research does," he said. "Going to
the Career Center early and often
does. It's important to love your
concentration, but also be very
clear-headed and very informed
about the particulars of future
opportunities."

and we've been very prideful in
our defense this year," Doug-
lass said. "We just didn't come
out and communicate as well we
should've.
"(With) their motion, I don't
think we expected to have to
communicate so much on screens

things," he said. "I think we just
underestimated how much work
we had to do on the defensive

Michigan coach Rich Rodri-
guez must have known the second
he lifted his arms into the air dur-
ing the Michigan football team's
end-of-the-year football banquet
that he
would be NOTEBOOK
questioned
about his impassioned speech.
And at Monday's football press
conference, he was. Repeatedly.
"Every coach has his own per-
sonality," Rodriguez said. "I've
always been emotional at our
senior banquets. You feel so close
to a team and particularly the
senior class and I'm proud of the
way they've hung in there."
Rodriguez has been tak-
ing some extra criticism since
Thursday for the events of the
banquet. At one point during the
evening,.the coach said, "I hope
you realize that I truly want to
be a Michigan man." Later, he
had all the players join hands
and became visibly emotional
while a recording of Josh Gro-
ban's You Raise Me Up played
over the loudspeakers.
"Everybody's going to have
their opinions on things and
that's fine," Rodriguez said. "I
appreciate everyone's interest in
what happened and what went
on, and try to sensationalize it. I
would rather talk about the bowl
game."
The antics at the banquet
prompted widespread response
from Michigan fans, with many
decrying what they perceived as
Rodriguez essentially begging for
his job.
. Some have argued that Rodri-
guez's hold on his position grows
weaker every day that goes by
without a vote of confidence from
his athletic director, Dave Bran-
don. Brandon has steadfastly
insisted he will evaluate the coach
after the bowl game.
So does that make the Gator
Bowl a must-win?
"I think every head coach at
this level goes into every game
thinking,'Boy, this is the game,'"
Rodriguez said Monday. "I think
people will try to put more impor-
tance on one than the other and
I understand that ... but I think
coaches put an enormous amount
of pressure on themselves to win
every game."
BOWL PRACTICES: Through-
out the season, a lack of experi-
ence on defense has led to many
execution issues on a unit loaded
with first year seniors, especially
in the secondary.
That's one of the reasons a bowl
game was so celebrated. Sure,
Michigan will be playing against
Mississippi State in the Wolver-
ines' first bowl game since the
2007 season, but Michigan is also
drooling over the 15 or so extra
practices they'll have to prepare
for the Gator Bowl.
"The first practice will be Fri-
day afternoon and we'll practice
Saturday morning, then Sunday
we'll be off," Rodriguez said.

Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez received national attention last Thursday during
an emotional speech at the team's end-of-the-year banquet.

"Anywhere from 11 to 12 practices
here and four.to five at the bowl
site."
The extra practices will be
essential in helping the defense,
which finished the season on a
sour note, giving up 37 points to
Ohio State on Nov.27.
Junior nose tackle Mike Mar-
tin said any time players spend
with coaches is time well spent.
"You improve any time you can
get your work in," Martin said.
"Whenever we get into a practice,
we're always sure we're ready to
work and get better."
The practices will focus on
Mississippi State but also on get-
ting players healed up and ready to
play on Jan. 1. Junior wide receiv-
er Darryl Stonum said he thought
most of the players with nagging
injuries will be as healthy for the
Gator Bowl as they've been since
week one against Connecticut.
Specifically, he said Michigan
fans would likely see the most
healthy version of sophomore
quarterback Denard Robinson
since the first week of the season.
"He (Rodriguez) told us there
wasn't going to be too much beat-
ing our bodies up," Stonum said.
"It's more individual drills, going
over fundamentals. There won't
be too much banging and scrim-
maging and stuff like that. No
need to beat ourselves up, might
as well save it to beat up on Mis-
sissippi State."
PLAYERS STAND BY RODRI-
GUEZ: While the players were
at the press conference to talk
about Mississippi State, the cloud
of uncertainty hanging over the
Michigan football program and
its coach was sure to surface.
But the players made one thing
clear: they are standing by their

coach.
"I don't think there's a guy on
our team that's not supportive of
coach Rodriguez right now," Ryan
Van Bergen said. "If anything it
just brings us together. We have
our wagons circled around coach
Rodriguez. Our team counts on
him. We rely on him. We all have
faith in him. The criticism stuff
doesn't pull us apart like it might
seem."
Added Darryl Stonum: "I'd
be pretty devastated if anything
happened (to Rodriguez). I'm
pretty sure he'll stay here. ...
Coach seems pretty confident."
Van Bergen took issue with
the timing of the decision, which
Brandon has stressed would come
after the bowl game.
"I would appreciate it to be
declared I think," Van Bergen
said of Rodriguez's job status.
"But I have 100 percent faith in
Dave Brandon too. ... I think it
would be more beneficial to just
come out and make a statement
just so some of the players have
an idea. But obviously there's rea-
sons I don't know about that it
can't be done at this point."
INJURY REPORT: After being
banged up for much of the season,
Robinson should be fine for the
bowl game. "He should be able
to do everything when we start
practice on Friday." ... Redshirt
junior wideout Junior Heming-
way should be okay. Rodriguez
expects Martin, senior linebacker
Jonas Mouton, sophomore wide
receiver Je'Ron Stokes, Stonum
and redshirt freshman running
back Fitzgerald Toussaint all to
practice by next week.

It's time to take
Ohio State seriously

Before facing off against
Ohio State for a pair of
games last weekend, Mich-
igan coach
Red Berenson
insisted that STEPHEN J.
he didn't NESBITT
consider the
Buckeyes and On Ice Hockey
Wolverines to
be rivals on the ice.
"I can't sell them a rivalry that
really doesn't exist," Berenson said
after practice last Wednesday, sug-
gesting that to his team, Ohio State
is just a regular opponent.
When comparing the teams' his-
tories, Berenson's point is clear: it's
no contest.
Michigan has captured nine
NCAA championships in its 23
Frozen Four appearances, while
Ohio State has never played for a
national title.
The Wolverines lead the all-time
matchup 66-31-11 - a total that
includes an eight-year, 34-game
undefeated stretch for Michigan
that began in 1990. In that span,
Ohio State wasn't even competi-
tive - just two of its 27 regulation
losses were by one goal.
Truth be told, Michigan's storied
program is a benchmark in college
hockey, while Ohio State hasn't con-
tended with the nation's best teams
in its 49 years of existence. But
when the two teams took the ice
on Friday and Saturday, the history

books remained on the shelf.
This time around, Ohio State
had a new look. First-year Ohio
State coach Mark Osiecki, formerly
an assistant coach at Wisconsin,
has his team playing fundamen-
tal hockey. Although they aren't
necessarily near contending for a
national title, they are competitive
enough to be a roadblock.
Fans in Columbus have taken
notice of the changes, and though
the Buckeyes may not fill their
rink - the 20,000-seat Value City
Arena - the wheels haven't fallen.
off of their bandwagon just yet.
Rather, it's gainingspeed.
Even though Michigan hadn't
swept consecutive games in
Columbus since the 1999-2000
season, the 11th-ranked Wolverines
expected take the two-game series
last weekend with ease.
Berenson refused to call the
matchup a rivalry, but after the
Buckeyes nearly sent Michigan
home empty-handed, Michigan
(5-3-1-0 CCHA, 9-5-4 overall)
should be singing a different tune.
Through 59 minutes on Friday,
the Wolverines had the advantage
both in intensity and on the score-
board, butgave up a goal with just
under 11 seconds to tie the game,
2-2. The Buckeyes capped off their
comeback with the game-winning
tally early in the overtime period.
As the scarlet and gray jerseys
celebrated by the end boards,

several dismayed and defeated
Wolverines skated off the ice and
headed to the dressing room - the
absences were noticed during the
postgame handshakes at center ice.
In the press conference follow-
ing the game, Berenson defended
his players, as did senior forward
Louie Caporusso.
"It was such a quick endingthat
everyone was celebrating and some
of the guys just forgot and came
off the ice," Caporusso said. "We
don't usually do things like that.
It wasn't by any means disrespect,
they just forgot."
Whether it was a case of for-
getfulness or not, avoiding the
standard handshakes can stir up
plenty of strife on the opposing
team --just ask the Detroit Red
Wings about their thoughts on
Sidney Crosby skipping out on the
handshakes after the 2009 Stanley
Cup finals.
Sometimes, it doesn't take much
to ignite a rivalry.
Regardless, Ohio State (3-6-1-1,
6-8-1) is no longer getting beat into
the ground on a yearly basis by
Michigan, and has proven itself an
admirable adversary for the Wol-
verines. The teams meet in Ann
Arbor for another pair of games in
early February. And a little advice
for Michigan: tread lightly around
these Buckeyes.
Oh, and don't forget the hand-
shake.

Funding a home
County must work to decrease homelessness
Jf you've been encountering more panhandlers around cam-
pus lately, you're not alone. The number of homeless indi-
viduals in Washtenaw County, specifically in the city of Ann
Arbor, increased in 2009. But area homeless shelters haven't been
able to keep up with the influx of people in need of help. As the
weather in Michigan gets colder - even dangerously cold - it's
especially important that homeless people have a shelter avail-
able. Washtenaw County and its residents have a social responsi-
bility to help the homeless. The county should allocate resources
toward expanding homeless shelters and programs for helping

0

these individuals to find jobs.
According to the Washtenaw County
Office of Community Development, the
number of homeless individuals registered
in the county has grown from 3,940 in 2006
to 4,618 in 2009, as reported in an Oct. 25
Daily article. This increase has resulted in
overcrowding at shelters around Washtenaw
County. Ellen Schulmeister, executive direc-
tor of the Shelter Association of Washtenaw
County, attributes this increase to the "gen-
erosity of students." Brian Nord, a found-
ing member of the tent city for homeless
individuals known as Camp Take Notice,
believes that homeless people are drawn to
Ann Arbor because of the safety of the city.
The residents of Washtenaw County
should devote time to understanding and
battling homelessness. While giving money
to the panhandlers is kind, it may have an
effect of keeping homeless individuals from
becoming financially self-sufficient. Stu-
dents and other residents should make an
effort to realize the causes behind the pov-
erty of the homeless.
It's a public duty ofthe county to help those
who are financially less fortunate. Home-
less shelters are able to provide food, water
and a bed to people who would otherwise go
without. Currently, the Delonis Center - the
main homeless shelter in downtown Ann

Arbor - is able to help 1,200 to 1,500 people
annually in a variety of ways by maxing out
its resources. But the shelters still aren't able
to help everyone in need. Washtenaw County
needs to allocate more funds toward improv-
ing shelters and building more so they can
help more people.
Shelters can't single-handedly solve the
problem of homelessness. Though home-
less shelters are important in the short term,
homeless individuals still need help in the
long term. Individuals often move from
shelter to shelter and are never lifted out of
poverty. It's crucial that there are resources
in place to help homeless people to find jobs
and eventually a permanent place to live.
The Delonis Center currently has a long-
term residential system in place, but it needs
the resources from the county to expand so
it can serve more people. Washtenaw Coun-
ty needs to increase social services aimed at
decreasing poverty and homelessness, which
are necessary to reduce the number of peo-
ple who rely on the shelters.
The increase in the number of home-
less individuals in Ann Arbor has stretched
resources too thin to help all those in need.
The county needs to allocate resources to
provide immediate help to the homeless,
while also helping to lift them out of poverty.

As the fall sports season for the
Big Ten draws to a close, it
brings the end of an era. Next
year schedules,
teams and com-
petition level will
change for all Big
Ten sports when 4
the University of
Nebraska joins
the conference.
We shouldn't get
comfortable with -
just the addition of COURTNEY
Nebraska - there's
potential for even FLETCHER
more teams to
join the Big Ten in
the coming years.
While most fans won't be personally
affected by the addition of Nebraska
- after all, it's just an extra team on
the schedule - it affects the Big Ten
greatly.
The level of competition from
Nebraska will be undeniably high.
The Cornhuskers live and breathe
athletics and have outstanding sup-
port from fans. They have 21 teams
- including bowling and rifle - that
are all talented. At the end of each
year, the National Association of Col-
legiate Directors of Athletics gives
out an award called the Directors
Cup. This award runs on a system
that awards each team a certain num-
ber of points. Whichever school has
the most points at the end of the year
is crowned the strongest Athletic
Department. Last year, five Big Ten
schools were in the top 25 - the Uni-
versity of Michigan included - and
so was Nebraska. The Big Ten isn't
just adding easy wins to its sched-
ules, it's adding a high-level competi-
tor that not only has the potential to
hold its own, but could possibly be a
powerhouse Big Ten team.
Highly competitive teams are fol-

lowed closely by fan support. The Big
Ten is known for having outstanding
and downright rabid fans. Rivalry
games like Ohio State vs. Michigan,
Michigan vs. Michigan State and
Purdue vs. Indiana all bring out the
best - or worst - in fans and games.
If you've ever played Nebraska or
been to a Husker event, you know
these fans are no exception. The
state of Nebraska has no profession-
al teams or notable tourist attrac-
tions, but they have the University
of Nebraska. They think they're the
best, expect the best and play the
best, which means they'll fit right in
with the mentalities of schools like
Michigan State University and Ohio
State University. I think teams will
enjoy competing against the Huskers.
It's an experience that can't be for-
gotten. For example, when the volley-
ball team beat the Huskers in three
short games on their home court in
fall 2006, I've never heard 5,000 peo-
ple so quiet.
Scheduling is going to be the big-
gest change for athletic teams. For 20
years, teams have enjoyed the same
rotation in schedules. For exam-
ple, volleyball has enjoyed an even
"round-robin" schedule where every-
one plays each other twice each sea-
son - once at home and once away.
With new teams comes larger rota-
tions and fewer meetings of teams.
There has been fear that rivalries
would be lost. Can you imagine a
football season without a Michigan
matchup against Michigan State or
Ohio State? While fans enjoy watch-
ing our football team beat up on the
University of Connecticut and Illi-
nois, those aren't the games that they
enjoy the most. Keeping the confer-
ence strong is important, but I think
keeping traditional rivalries alive is
as, if not more, important.
So far, rivalries have stayed in tact,

0
but with the possibility of adding
more teams I think we'll see fewer of
these matchups. There's a possibil-
ity that fewer meetings will lead to
rivalry games becoming an even big-
ger deal, leaving teams with two-year
bragging rights. But I can only see fans
liking this if their team wins. Nobody
wants Michigan State boasting for
two straight years without a chance
at redemption. But because the con-
ference is driven by money and the
media, it seems these games would
stay on the schedules simply because
of the revenue that they bring in.
Nebraska could
be a powerhouse 0
Big Ten team.
While the Big Ten will benefit
from the addition of Nebraska, the
biggest beneficiary is Nebraska itself. *
The Big Ten is a stronger and more
prestigious conference than the Big
12 - Nebraska's current conference
- which should improve the school's
recruiting. The Big Ten is stronger
than the Big 12 in academics as well.
At first I resisted the idea of add-
ing new teams to the Big Ten, but I'm
starting to come around. People said
the same thing when Pennsylvania
State University was added 20 years
ago and it has turned out to be one
of the strongest teams in the confer-
ence. While nextyear might be a little
shaky as the Big Ten adjusts, I think
it's going to turn out to be an over-
whelming positive in the end.

Make time for contemplation

Who's to say what it means
to bea true'Michigan Man?'
TO THE DAILY:
I'm so glad all the Michigan Men happen to
write for the Daily. It's such a fresh breath of
air for you guys to let us, the students, know
who really is and isn't fit for the overused and
now meaningless title of "Michigan Man."
Hell, I had no clue all you young journalists had
the merit and experience to judge who should
be fit for the throne as head coach of our foot-
ball team.
Imran Syed's recent column (The next Michi-
gan Man, 12/06/2010) is so full of shit that you
can tell from his picture that he's enjoying his
own stink. I didn't know that "Until three years
ago, all was well with the state's great Univer-
sity and its football team." I forgot about Lloyd
Carr giving up on recruiting, giving up on bowl
games (losing five out of his last seven) and giv-
ing up on "The Game" with Ohio State (losing a
pitiful seven out of his last ten).
So, Syed, was Bo a "Michigan Man" because
he grew up in Ohio, played for Miami of Ohio
and coached for Ohio State or is it because he
won games? Because if it's the latter, then that
would mean all it takes to be a "Michigan Man"
is winning games. But that would contradict
your point that there is more than just winning
required to be deemed a "Michigan Mar."
Please tell me how many other coaches these
days are "leaders" that push for better academ-
ics and an all-around better campus - because
I can't find any. Do you know why I can't find
any? It's because all the fans (and the media,
which includes you) have been getting so
worked up about any flaw in Michigan athlet-
ics that we simply won't allow for anything but
the best coaches and players.
You see, back in the day the students didn't
all wear the same silly colors to games (What
is this, Michigan State?) and there weren't 500

SEND LETTERS TO: TOTHEDAILY@UMICH.EDU
Michigan apparel stores on campus. People
had a little more patience when it came to los-
ing. Coaches weren't fired every three years
because the virtue of patience was a little more
prominent. Yes, Roderiguez has a bad record,
but as supposedly smart as this school is, get-
ting rid of him doesn't seem to be wise. With
wisdom comes patience. If you did the math (3
wins, 5 wins, and this year 7), you would know
that things are headed up. But no: You want
results and you want them now. Give me, give
me, give me. You sound like a "Michigan Man."
I mustn't forget Managing Sports Editor Ryan
Kartje, either. Kartje wrote a scathing column
speaking against the head coach when Michi-
gan was chosen for abowl game (GatorBowlputs
Michigan's coachingfarce in spotlight, 12/06/2010)
- which is a privilege, not a right, by the way.
Athletic Director Dave Brandon is keeping Rich-
Rod until after the game because he, unlike you,
has patience and doesn't jump to conclusions like
the media and the ungrateful student population.
Iknow if Bo had sung the same Josh Groban song
while still alive, you would have certainly praised
him faster than I could say "ironically-nonathlet-
ic sports columnist."
Do you really want current Stanford foot-
ball head coach Jim Harbaugh to be the next
Michigan head coach? The guy who grew up a
brat in the Michigan football system? The guy
who didn't grab the coaching job the first time
around because he was too busy bad-mouthing
his former alma mater for their supposed lack
of academics? The guy who grew up with a sil-
ver, maize and blue spoon in his mouth? Have
you read the news recently? Harbaugh has a
nice big contract at Stanford. And he'll prob-
ably stay there - but my guess is that's only
because he doesn't want to have to deal with
the bratty, self-entitled students at Michigan.
Keep up the great junior high journalism,
guys.
Sam Zettell
School of Music, Theatre & Dance senior

n writing my last column (Pur-
suing the Semester's Theme,
11/22/2010), I sought to bet-
ter understand
the nature of the
LSA theme semes-
ter, "What makes
life worth liv-
ing?" I wanted to
articulate why I "
felt slapped in the
face every time I
saw it advertised
around campus. I LIBBY
wanted to know
the intentions of ASHTON
the professors who
organized it. I also
wanted to grasp the implications of
probing such self-conscious thought
among students at the University.
That aspiration to have a sense of
what it would mean for us - students
who live a specific lifestyle and face a
specific set of challenges - to answer
the question posed by the theme
semester required further conver-
sation, consideration and a longer
word-count. I decided that I should
learn about how anyone considers the
meaning of life and then assess how
well-situated we are to make the con-
sideration ourselves.
I spoke with the two professors
who organized the theme semester,
Psychology Professor Christopher
Peterson and Ford School of Pub-
lic Policy Professor John Chamber-
lin. I suspected both perspectives
would offer personal and profes-
sional insight on considerations of
the meaning of life. I also hoped
they would maintain an awareness
of undergraduate students' unique
position. From our conversations and
from my own introspection, I think
I'm on to something.
Answering the question "What

makes life worth living?" requires
two steps: first, living an active life
that has meaning and second, living
a contemplative life that allows for
the appreciation of meaning. At first
glance, it seems that action requires
harder work and leaves more room
for mishap than contemplation. After
all, things that stand in our way of
action are often out of our control,
whereas what stands in our way of
thought is under no one else's control
but our own.
When I asked Chamberlin what
made his life worth living, he said
his theme semester t-shirt reads,
"Justice Makes Life Worth Living."
His answer is consistent with duties
of government, which his field (pub-
lic policy) is responsible for study-
ing. When I asked Peterson the same
question, he responded in an e-mail,
"work, love, play and service." A basic
understanding of the duties of gov-
ernment might demand that a just
society allows all people to lead an
active, meaningful life of work, love,
play and service.
So if society does its job in guaran-
teeing the freedom to actively pursue
happiness, does it have a further obli-
gation to guarantee the space to con-
templatively pursue happiness?
Internalizing the richness of life
requires time - time to wander
(both in place and in thoughts), time
to form beliefs as well as challenge
them, and time to create something.
But, as Chamberlin and many others
of his generation have noted, we - as
University students - don't have that
kind of time. We've found ourselves
in a system that places extreme pres-
sure on the task of leading an active,
meaningful life but inhibits our abil-
ity to engage the equally important
task of contemplation.
Chamberlin acknowledged the

conundrum. He noted that the stu-
dents he admits to the Ford School of
Public Policy are expected to havetop
grades, display serious leadership in
several extracurricular activities and
remain interesting, energized and
engaging people. We have a campus
full of students who race from one
source of meaning to the next, rarely
stopping to breathe let alone read a
piece of fiction for pleasure. These
students' ability to lead a maximally
fulfilling life is stifled by their leading
lives that are too full.
Internalizing
the richness of life
requires time.
The pathways to meaning and hap-
piness vary with each person. For
some, love is the answer. For others,
it's freedom. Peterson said cheering
on the Wolverines could be a primary
source of purpose for someone.
But the "What makes life worth
living?" t-shirt that can be worn by
everyone reads "balance." We seem
to live in a culture that's collectively
off-balance. I would call for a serious
reprioritization. In order for society's
future leaders to do their jobs well,
they must be nourished emotionally,
psychologically and spiritually. As we
transition into finals and then into
our all-too-short winter break, I hope
we're forced to consider the balance
in our own lives and restore what's
not there.

From Page 1
sort of regain the former glories,
it feels like it's going to go on for-
ever and we're never going to get
there," Coleman said. "But we'll
get there again."
Coleman went on to talk about
several football programs across
the country that she said have
seen struggle recently - includ-
ing Florida, which went 13-1 in
2009 but then went 7-5 this sea-
son, and Alabama, which. was
expected to compete for a nation-
al championship this year, but
will instead be playing Michigan
State in the Capital One Bowl.
"This is the waxing and wan-
ing as you readjust to new things,"
Coleman said.
In slight contrast, Coleman

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

answered another student's ques-
tion about the criteria for success
she has for athletics at the Univer-
sity by sayingthere are real expec-
tations that do include winning.
"We have expectations for all
of our teams that they're going to
compete regularly to be at the top,"
she said. "We knowthatthey're not
going to be champions every year,
you can't be, but we want to be."
Coleman continued, "And
that's what we aspire to. You've
got to keep believing. Don't ever
stop believing."
But Coleman said winning
doesn't define a program's value -
athletic or academic at the Universi-
ty - describing University students
and Michigan fans as being "big"
when they face disappointment.
"We're not defined by whether
we win or lose," she said. "We're
defined by being a great school

that is competitive in everything
it does, whether it's the athletic
arena or the academic arena."
Coleman also explicitly reaf-
firmed her support for the Ath-
letic Department overall, saying
the University remains dedicated
to its athletic programs.
"We are committed," she said.
"We're committed to having great
programs with great integrity in
every sport."
One sign of that commitment
that Coleman pointed to was the
recently completed addition of
skyboxes and premium seating at
the Big House.
"This is very important to
Michigan and this will always
be important," she said. "We've
made a huge investment in the
facilities and it's something that
brings everybody together. I
think it's absolutely wonderful."

Hollywood's wintry mix

Franco gets Ginsberg
in heavy-handed 'Howl'

ondemned to consistently
late nights in the weeks
leading up to December
exams, I was awarded a small but
valuable gift
for my efforts
last Wednes-
day. At 6:15 in
the morning,
finally set to
sleep, I looked

snow.
Light, float-

S descend below the lights on Pack-
ard Street, I suddenly remem-
bered why I chose to endure
the constant street noise of a
front-facing room in my house.
I had once again discovered the
upside of an Ann Arbor winter. If
it's going to be cold, it better be
snowing.
Despite my fatigue and inevi-
table sleep deprivation, the snow
got me jumping up and down,
celebrating the moment like a kid
on Christmas morning. With the
visual cue of a snowfall, my inter-
nal calendar turned to the holiday
season.
My love of snow and the
holiday season is largely based
on movie depictions - that kid
rejoicing last Wednesday wasn't
actually me, it was Fuller (Kieran
Culkin) in "Home Alone 2." Film
has historically exploited the sea-
son to the fullest extent, and yet
has perpetuated holiday family
values in direct, easily under-
stood fashion.
Christmas sells big, and film
studios are acutely aware of it.
Kids come home from break,
adults get work off. The peak
of Oscar season is one of the
best times for the blockbuster,
as shown by the mid-December
releases of all three "Lord of the
Rings" films and the box-office
Toruk Makto "Avatar." With
such a huge audience at its dis-
posal, the film industry wastes no
opportunity to cash in on Christ-
mas.
November and December are
perennially characterized by
films like "Christmas with the

Poet biopic doesn't
leave much to the
imagination

Daily Arts Writer

and penny loafers pack the room.

it lingers under
a heavy spotlight At the
on stage. One Michigan
young man steps Oscilloscope
into the light,
adjusts his heavy framed glasses
and begins to read: "I saw the best
minds of my generation destroyed
by madness, starving hysterical
naked..."
With these words, Allen Gins-
berg's immortal poem "Howl"
gave a voice to the Beat Genera-
tion. The film "Howl" tries to cap-
ture the essence of the poem and
examine Ginsberg's (James Fran-
co, "127 Hours") own experiences
- his writing process, the mean-
ing and imagery of the poem, as
well as the obscenity trials that
followed its publication.
Franco may as well be in hip-
ster heaven with his Ginsberg
part. Playing the poet adds just
the right amount of coolness to
any actor's resume. But at first
it seems that his beard isn't wild
enough, he's too handsome, too
suave. Franco just doesn't seem
to be enough of an outsider. He's
more of a Neal Cassady or a Jack
Kerouac type.
However, as soon as he starts
reading the poem, any doubts
about Franco's ability to pull off
the role vanish. "Howl" (the poem)

Look at that fucking hipster.
was written to be read aloud and
Franco is aware of this. He aptly
captures the jazz-inspired rhythm
and manages to insert humor at
exactly the right parts - poems
about "alcohol and cock and end-
less balls" can't possibly be read
with a straight face the whole way
through.
But of course, the problem with
such a convincing performance
is that it becomes a Franco-as-
Ginsberg-fest and "Howl" doesn't
just belong to him. It's not just
his story, but also the story of
the minds of a generation. There
isn't just one way to interpret the
poem.
Part of the film's struggle is in
interpreting the poem. As Gins-
berg reads the poem, the black and
white film dissolves into a strung-
out animation. The process of
reading a poem is based on inter-
preting for oneself what things
like "storefront boroughs of tea-
head joyride neon blinking traf-
fic light" actually mean. Instead
of allowing the audience to figure
that out, there's a cartoon about

it. But this is very limiting - the
animation just might not work for
some viewers. While it's perfectly
OK that the animators thought
a particular line would be best
shown as a forest of giant dicks,
that's not necessarilythe only way
to read it. But it still comes across
like that is the message, despite
the movie's best efforts to deal
with and incorporate a variety of
themes ranging from Eastern phi-
losophy to drug-induced hazes.
At any rate, poetry interpreta-
tion is sticky business and perhaps
a difficult pursuit on film. But
what "Howl" provides a context
for the poem through the obsceni-
ty trial without turning the movie
into a biopic or a documentary.
Jon Hamm ("Mad Men") plays the
lawyer defending the poem and,
near the end of the movie, delivers
a strong monologue about free-
dom of speech. From a historical
approach, this is perhaps the most
significant part of the legacy of
"Howl" as a poem - as a reminder
of the American tradition of free-
dom and a celebration of diversity.
