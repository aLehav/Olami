In 
April 
2017, 
then-
Engineering senior Michael 
Heinrich was just shy of 
graduating 
when 
a 
rotted 
tree fell on him while riding 
his 
motorcycle 
to 
class. 
The accident left Heinrich 
quadriplegic 
after 
he 
was 
paralyzed at his C-6 vertebrae 
in the neck region of the spine.
Heinrich, 
who 
was 
studying to be a geotechnical 
engineer, said he was riding 
his motorcycle on a pathway 
below 
Northwood 
housing 
on North Campus when he 
heard a loud crack behind 
him. By the time he realized 
what was happening, he said 
he was pinned to the ground, 
paralyzed.
From the moment he hit the 
ground, he said he knew he 
was going to be paralyzed for 
the rest of his life.
“After my accident, I was 
conscious,” Heinrich said. “I 
might have blacked out for 10 
seconds or so, but I knew what 
was going on, and I was laying 
there. I was like, ‘I need to get 
up.’ And I realized I couldn’t 
get up. At that moment, I knew 
I was paralyzed.”
After spending the summer 
in intensive care and then 
rehab at Michigan Medicine 
in 2017 — accumulating more 
than $2 million in medical bills 
— he and his family turned to 
the University to ask for help 
paying the bills. 
Heinrich’s 
family 
then 
pursued legal action, seeking 
some compensation for the 
care that Heinrich received 

and would need in the future. 
The lawsuit — a copy of 
which was obtained by The 
Daily — was filed in October 
2018 under claims of gross 
negligence. The Daily also 
obtained the transcript of a 
hearing on June 26, 2019 at the 
Washtenaw 
County 
Circuit 
Court. 
Currently, 
lawyer 
Dean 
Googasian of The Googasian 
Firm, PC, a firm handling 
catastrophic injury cases, is 
representing 
Heinrich. 
His 
case is still in litigation.
University 
spokeswoman 
Kim Broekhuizen said in an 
email to The Daily that the 
University regrets the incident 
but 
cannot 
comment 
on 
ongoing litigation.
“The University is sorry 
this 
accident 
occurred,” 
Broekhuizen wrote. “However, 
the tree had been appropriately 
inspected prior to the accident 
and appeared to be healthy. 
As a result, the circuit court 
dismissed the case and the 
plaintiff has appealed.”
Heinrich said the case was 
filed under claims of gross 
negligence and alleges the 
University knew the tree was 
rotted and yet did not follow 
proper procedure to ensure 
the safety of those passing by 
the tree. 
According to the transcript 
The Daily obtained, University 
lawyer Keefe Brooks said gross 
negligence is “conduct that 
essentially exhibits an I-don’t-
care-type attitude.” In this 
case, the University arborist, 
Marvin Pettway, had inspected 
the tree for rotting and had 
allegedly noticed the fungus 

but determined it was not 
convincing of full-rot. 
According 
to 
Googasian, 
Pettway 
said 
during 
his 
deposition, that if it fell, it 
could 
“crack 
the 
concrete 
built for trucks to drive on.” 
But Brooks said that Pettway 
didn’t determine it a risk with 
the information he collected. 
Under 
this 
provision, 
the 
University asserted they do not 
owe Heinrich compensation.
Heinrich 
pointed 
to 
an 
aspect of the lawsuit that 
mentions patches of fungi that 
were apparent on the base of 
the tree, showing it was rotting. 
“The reason why there was 
even a possible case is that at 
the time, we looked from the 
Google Street maps view and 
you could see fungus at the base 
of the tree,” Heinrich said.
As time passed, Heinrich 
said he and his family felt the 
University became increasingly 
callous about the situation.
While 
he 
was 
in 
the 
intensive care unit only a 
few days after the accident, 
Heinrich was intubated and 
had a tracheotomy to help him 
breathe. His neck was snapped 
and his spine was broken, along 
with many other bones. While 
in this state, he said a University 
liaison from the Engineering 
department visited him in the 
hospital 
demanding 
graded 
assignments for a course for 
which he served as an assistant 
instructor. Heinrich said he 
was in disbelief he was being 
asked this in the hospital. 
“The liaison was obviously 
fully aware of my situation,” 
Heinrich said. “She was like, 
‘We need these papers that 

he graded.’ And here I am in 
the hospital trying to explain 
where these papers are and I 
was like, ‘What? You need these 
papers, and yet I’m literally here 
possibly dying.’ The University 
didn’t care if I was alive. They 
didn’t care about anything.”
Heinrich also said he was 
extremely upset when this 
liaison told him, during this 
exchange, that the University 
didn’t have the funds to help 
mitigate any costs for him.
“I might have broken my 
neck, I might have snapped 
everything in my body, and if 
there were five stages of grief 
for your body, I was essentially 
grieving,” Heinrich said. “I was 
going out of those pretty quickly 
and still, I wasn’t broken until 
the University told me, ‘We’re 
not going to help you out.’”
Heinrich also described his 
struggle with everyday care. 
Before the accident, he said 
his parents lived in Ludington, 
Mich., but they have since 
moved to Ann Arbor to care for 
him full-time. 
Heinrich said care is a large 
financial burden, and he is 
now receiving federal food 
stamps. He also said he receives 
coverage through Medicaid and 
Medicare and uses disability 
rights and social security to pay 
for health care.
He said he now requires 
special 
medical 
appliances 
to urinate, which would cost 
$36,000 per year without his 
insurance. Heinrich said he has 
been forced to pay this because

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Students 
Demand 
Action, 
a division of Everytown for 
Gun Safety, and the American 
Civil Liberties Union hosted a 
discussion on the impact of gun 
violence on communities of color. 
About 30 students and professors 
attended the event on Friday 
evening at Annenberg Auditorium. 
Nursing junior Grace Bontrager, 
co-leader of the Students Demand 
Action 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan, said she formed the 
group after the Parkland school 
shooting in 2018. 
Bontrager said their group was 
the first SDA to start on a university 
campus. 
“I wanted a concrete way to get 
involved in gun violence prevention 
in my community,” Bontrager said. 
“It’s a lofty goal but essentially 
(SDA) wants to end gun violence in 
America by working with everyone 
in the country and the 300+ SDA 
groups across the nation. Our three 

main pillars of what we do here 
are education by talking about the 
issue, policy, legislative work and 
community work.” 
The conversation began with the 
three panel members introducing 
themselves and sharing the impact 
gun violence has had on their lives.
University 
alum 
Benjamin 
Hester, 
a 
representative 
of 
Solomon Rajput’s campaign for 
Congress, spoke about the recent 
loss of his teenage cousin. Hester 
said his cousin wasn’t a part of any 
gangs and did not possess firearms 
but was leaving school when an 
altercation occurred. 
“It’s something that I’ve been 
thinking 
about 
and 
working 
through, and it just never really 
makes sense to me to be angry at 
some 20-year-old running around 
trying to play gangster because he 
didn’t feel like there was anything 
else or that there was another life 
that he would have wanted to live,” 
Hester said.

Following announcements of 
multiple University of Michigan-
affiliated faculty and staff facing 
misconduct 
claims 
since 
the 
Winter 2020 semester began, 
a number of students told The 
Daily they have lost trust in the 
University’s ability to protect 
them.
Several 
University 
faculty 

members faced sexual misconduct 
accusations made public within 
the past month. Martin Philbert, 
provost 
and 
executive 
vice 
president for academic affairs, 
was placed on leave effective 
Jan. 20 for sexual misconduct 
and 
harassment 
allegations. 
Engineering 
professor 
Jason 
Mars stepped down from his 
position as CEO of Clinc, an AI 
company he founded, after The 
Verge published allegations of 
sexual misconduct and abusive 
behavior against him on Feb. 13. 

On Wednesday, multiple sexual 
assault allegations brought against 
the late Robert E. Anderson, 
former 
director 
and 
sports 
physician of University Health 
Services, were made public. 
University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
sent 
an 
email 
to 
University students and faculty 
on Jan. 22 informing them of 
Philbert’s 
leave 
from 
office. 
Philbert was appointed as provost 
and vice president for academic 
affairs in 2017 and previously 
served in various roles in the 

School of Public Health since 1995. 
The Detroit Free Press reported 
the 
University 
has 
known 
about other sexual misconduct 
allegations against Philbert since 
2003. 
In response to a request for 
comment, the University’s Office 
of Public Affairs directed The 
Daily to Schlissel’s statement on 
the several recent allegations 
during the Feb. 20 Board of 
Regents meeting.

“As 
a 
physician, 
scientist, 
father and university president, I 
condemn all sexual misconduct, 
especially instances that occur 
under the purview of our public 
mission,” Schlissel said. “This type 
of conduct is reprehensible — and 
whether it takes place now or took 
place in the past, it is unacceptable.”
The Daily interviewed multiple 
students across campus for the 
perspectives of the student body 
about 
these 
allegations. 
LSA 
sophomore Emma Sandberg, a 
founder of the student group Roe 
v. Rape, said she was angry and 
confused, 
but 
not 
necessarily 
surprised, 
when 
she 
received 
Schlissel’s email about Philbert. 
“The fact that the University 
was aware of at least three 
complaints against him and still 
promoted him to the Provost 
highlights how the administration 
does not in any sense take sexual 
misconduct seriously, and that 
there is a structural problem at U 
of M,” Sandberg said. “This is a 
man who sounds to be outwardly 
inappropriate in a sexual manner 
to those working with him, and 
so I’m not exactly sure why some 
administrators, like the president, 
are claiming that they had no idea 
of any sexual misconduct.”
Ariel Friedlander, LSA and 
Art & Design senior, said it is 
concerning that someone who 
holds a powerful position at the 
University, such as Philbert, was 
accused of sexual misconduct. 
According to Friedlander, this gives 
power to perpetrators and makes 
them believe they should aspire to 
powerful roles in society. 
“People 
see 
this 
predator 
revealed at the University, it’s 
terrible and people want to speak 
out and that’s great,” Friedlander 
said. “People should be speaking 
out and they should be questioning 
who’s in power and who’s in charge 
of 
overseeing 
sexual 
violence 
prevention, who’s in charge of 
taking care of survivors, women 
and minorities on this campus. But 
this is just the tip of the iceberg, 
and below the sea, there’s a history 
of violent oppression and sexual 
misconduct. This is so much bigger 
than this one man, and the fact 
that he has so much power at this 
institution means he’s upheld by 
this history.”
Anderson 
worked 
at 
the 
University for 35 years and served 
as a top physician for football teams 
coached by Bo Schembechler and 
Lloyd Carr. University alum Robert 
Julian Stone filed a complaint 
against the University in 2018, 
nearly 50 years after the alleged 
incident. The oldest complaint 
dates back to 1995, when a female 
student filed a lawsuit against 
Anderson for an incident during a 
mandatory medical examination 
for employment. Anderson retired 
from the University in 2003 and 

passed away in 2008. 
Medical student Mark-Anthony 
Lingaya said he was disappointed 
to read that Anderson allegedly 
abused patients when serving as 
UHS Director. 
“As a medical student, you go 
through classes where you learn the 
art of doctoring, how to gain your 
patient’s trust, how to keep your 
patient’s trust and the privilege 
you have with regards to patients,” 
Lingaya said. “It’s really shocking 
that someone was taking advantage 
of that and traumatizing patients 
and completely breaching that 
relationship and its foundation.”
Medical student Andrew Shute 
said he was concerned with the 
University’s handling of allegations 
against 
Anderson, 
particularly 
Anderson’s transfer from the head 
of UHS to team physician around 
the time of the alleged incidents in 
the 1970s. 
“It sounded like they were 
trying to sweep it under the rug by 
moving him from one place to the 
other,” Shute said. “If they’ve taken 
advantage of patients in general 
or committed sexual assault, they 
shouldn’t be allowed to continue 
being in a position where they take 
advantage of patients.”
Lingaya said the alleged abuses 
should not be taken lightly just 
because it took decades for victims 
to come forward. 
“My perspective is that these 
patients 
were 
terrified 
and 
confused,” Lingaya said. “Their 
trust was betrayed and they felt 
like they weren’t going to be 
believed … As a future physician 
and as Michigan students who 
are going to go on to positions of 
power and influence, we need to 
influence the spaces we’re in and 
make it so survivors of assault can 
comfortably and bravely come 
out and tell their stories without 
feeling like they’re not going to be 
believed.”
According to The Detroit News, 
66 students and faculty from the 
College of Engineering and School 
of Information signed a letter 
to Schlissel on Feb. 6 outlining 
allegations about an unnamed 
faculty member and calling on 
Schlissel to make changes to 
improve the campus climate. Mars 
has said he is not this unnamed 
individual. 
Last week, Computer Science 
and Engineering faculty released a 
statement calling for Mars to take 
a leave of absence. Though the 
Information School has announced 
it 
would 
be 
suspending 
its 
recruiting relationship with Mars, 
the University has not placed Mars 
on administrative leave. 
Brian Noble, chair of Computer 
Science and Engineering, sent an 
email to undergraduate students 
in the College of Engineering 
Saturday afternoon addressing the 
climate within the department. 
“I am writing today for three 
reasons,” Noble wrote. “First, 
to say that I am heartbroken 

for our community. There are 
profound problems with CSE’s 
climate. I know that there is a lot 
of frustration, pain and anger, 
and I share it. Second, I am 
sharing immediate steps that I 
have taken to address the recent 
climate concerns. Finally, I want 
to update you on some in-progress 
activity directed specifically at the 
Undergraduate programs in CSE.”
Engineering sophomore Tara 
Sabbineni said she was confused 
about the context of the email 
because Mars was not directly 
mentioned. 
“We got an email that said 
something really vague about ‘We 
know there’s a lot of issues in CSE, 
here are some of the things we’re 
trying to do to solve it,’ but I wasn’t 
aware of what they were talking 
about until my friend showed me 
The Verge article,” Sabbineni said. 
“They haven’t fired him or done 
anything about it yet. I understand 
why they sent such a vaguely 
worded email, but it was definitely 
a little weird.”
Mars was a speaker at the 
TedxUofM event on Feb. 14, which 
occurred after he resigned as CEO 
from his company Clinc. Though 
Mars was slated to speak at the 
event for months in advance, LSA 
freshman Ceciel Zhong said it was 
concerning that he was allowed to 
speak after the allegations were 
made public. 
“I heard that he spoke at the 
recent TED Talk, which is very 
unacceptable,” Zhong said. “There’s 
more than plenty of evidence that 
he had done such things, but it’s 
very disappointing that he’s still not 
on leave.”
Students who spoke with The 
Daily noted a specific cultural 
climate 
surrounding 
sexual 
misconduct 
nationally 
and 
on 
campus. 
Friedlander 
said 
conversations she has heard around 
the Philbert and Mars accusations 
have often missed what she sees as 
structural issues on campuses. 
“A lot of people see situations 
like these occur and they appear 
to be some type of isolated incident 
of some serious predator who has 
gotten away with so much, but it’s 
just one in a million people who 
commit acts of sexual violence 
and sexual misconduct against 
women,” Friedlander said. “These 
incidents were not a surprise to 
me. I don’t think the culture on 
campus is made to uplift women or 
survivors of sexual violence, or that 
(the University) breeds this type of 
culture.”
Music, 
Theatre 
& 
Dance 
sophomore 
Helen 
LaGrand 
reflected on instances of sexual 
misconduct within her school that 
The Daily reported on last year. She 
specifically noted Stephen Shipps, 
a former professor at the School of 
Music, Theater & Dance, who was 
accused of sexual misconduct and 
ultimately resigned. To LaGrand, 
these 
allegations 
were 
not 
surprising, as she said the culture 

of attending a large academic 
institution can make situations 
regarding 
sexual 
misconduct 
inevitable. 
“It’s what I would expect from 
an institution as huge as and as 
established this,” LaGrand said. 
“I know there are other schools 
around the country — particularly 
music schools because I can speak 
more to that — that have the same 
situations going on and a lot of 
those cases haven’t come to light. 
My opinion of the University hasn’t 
really changed. I think this is just 
inevitable that this would happen 
and I think it still has happened in 
a lot of other schools.”
LSA sophomore Ethan Hauser 
referenced the #MeToo movement 
when 
discussing 
the 
sexual 
misconduct 
allegations 
against 
faculty. Hauser said he thinks the 
University is only bringing up these 
allegations now because society has 
made these issues more acceptable 
to bring to light. 
“It doesn’t look good if you’re 
covering stuff up,” Hauser said. 
“Given how our society has 
changed the last few years with the 
#MeToo movement, it makes more 
sense that they’re coming out now 
compared to the past.”
Students told The Daily they 
believe the University does not 
have a strong history of being 
transparent with students and 
faculty about sexual misconduct 
allegations. Though students see 
the emails about Philbert and Mars 
as progress, many agreed more 
work needs to be done. 
Schlissel addressed concerns 
about transparency around the 
Philbert investigation at the Feb. 20 
Board of Regents meeting.
“Because 
this 
investigation 
is so critical, and because we 
must ensure that the outside, 
independent firm is able to conduct 
their investigation in a thorough, 
reliable and fair way, I will not be 
able to share any details while the 
investigation is underway, even 
though I know that there is wide 
interest in this case,” Schlissel said.
Even 
though 
students 
are 
asking for more clarity about 
the situations regarding sexual 
misconduct allegations, LaGrand 
said she believes the legal aspect of 
the allegations makes it hard for the 
University to be totally transparent 
about the situation. However, she 
said students and faculty who were 
directly involved with the accused 
should have a warning before the 
situation goes public. 
“It’s a very sensitive matter 
because the law is involved and 
there are victims involved who 
might not want to be spoken about. 
Transparency is tough,” LaGrand 
said. “Maybe it should be brought 
to students’ attention before they 
actually go on leave. Maybe if the 
professor is being looked into, more 
faculty should know about it or 
more students who are in contact 
with them should know about it 
before the decision is made to put 
them on leave. They shouldn’t wait 
to hear about it until then.”
Though 
Sandberg 
said 
she 
thinks Schlissel’s email to the 
student body is an improvement, 
she said the University could still 
provide more clarity. 
“I wasn’t very surprised by it 
based off of what I know about 
the University’s history with the 
issue,” Sandberg said. “I was more 
surprised by the fact that they 
emailed all of the students because 
that is pretty rare. Normally 
they sweep this under the rug.

When I called my mom last 
week, she said: “You should not 
come back at this moment. Stay 
safe and stay warm.” I knew 
how much they miss me as I 
haven’t been home for a year. 
A home I can’t come back and 
a family can’t reunion. That’s 
how 
coronavirus 
separated 
thousands of families in China. 
68,500 is the number who 
got infected by coronavirus, 
and 1,665 is the number of 
deaths caused by coronavirus, 
with the oldest aged 89 and the 
youngest aged 1 months. What 
people read from the news 
are just emotionless numbers, 
but beneath those numbers 
are those patients’ stories and 
sufferings. If people don’t know 
their helplessness, sadness and 
fear, they are just numbers.
Numbers can be emotionless, 
objective and calm. But humans 
can’t be.
The 7-month-old baby girl is 
just ready to see the beautiful 
view 
in 
the 
world 
while 
coronavirus attacked her. All her 
family members got infected. 
She, on her own, stays in the 
ICU. Every breath she takes is 
a fight to her fate. The beautiful 
and sweet angel is taking the 
biggest challenge in her life.
Will she grow up safe and 
sound?
I hope.
A 90-year-old woman kneels 
to beg the doctors to save her 
65-year-old son who is dying 
because of coronavirus. 
“Please stay alive, my boy.” 
Her sight can’t leave her son 
until they shut the door of the 
ward. 
The long goodbye. 
Will the son see his mother 
again?
I hope.
An eight-year-old boy was left 
home alone because his parents 
are doctors who were sent to 
help in Wuhan. While others are 
busy blaming his irresponsible 
parents, what they don’t know is 
how desperate and difficult the 
situation is, causing his parents 
to make this choice. But there 
are thousands of children at 
their son’s age, screaming and 
begging, waiting for doctors to 
save their lives. At that moment, 
their identities were not just 
parents, but also doctors. Do 
they worry about their own son? 

Of course, they do. Do they ever 
have a choice? No, they don’t.
“I never consider myself 
as noble. It just I have never 
become a deserter in my life and 
neither did this time,” his father 
said.
Will his parents come back 
soon?
I hope.
While on the other side of 
the world, another fear attacked 
the Chinese, or more broadly, 
Asians.
As long as people who have 
yellow skin, black eyes and black 
hair, and as long as they wear face 
masks to protect themselves, 
they are considered to be people 
who carry coronavirus and they 
get attacked because of how 
they look.
“We don’t accept Chinese 
customers for Coronavirus.” An 
announcement of a nail salon in 
the United States.
“Chinese kids should stay 
home and isolated.” An Australia 
back-to-school plea. 
“Coronavirus is made in 
China.” A headline of a German 
newspaper. 
A German-Asian man got 
attacked 
by 
strangers 
just 
because he was Asian, but he 
hasn’t been back to China for 
almost thirty years.
A 
13-year-old 
Chinese 
football player was cursed by 
his contestants, “I wish you got 
sick,” in a spring football match 
in Milan. He cried and left but 
was ignored by the judge.
What is wrong with this 
world?
Everyone 
can 
get 
sick, 
and people should never feel 
ashamed because they are sick.
On one side of the world, 
people were attacked by this 
virus; on other sides of the 
world, people were attacked 
by people. When it comes to 
disaster, the real fear is not the 
disaster itself but always to be 
humane. 
Virus kills life but racism kills 
mind.
The next time when I call my 
mom; I hope her answer is “It’s 
time for you to come home.” 
The 7-month-old baby could 
open her eyes to see the world. 
The 65-year-old man could 
embrace his mother. The eight-
year-old boy could stay with his 
parents. And, every Asian living 
abroad could have a normal and 
peaceful life.
And I hope all this will 
happen in the near future.

After watching the Netflix 
miniseries, When They See Us, 
I was brought to tears by the 
manipulation of innocence and 
infuriated with the acceptance 
of injustice. The episodes invited 
me to understand the story of the 
Exonerated Five beyond a news 
headline and reshaped my view 
of the carceral state. 
When I heard that one of the 
members of the Exonerated Five, 
Yusef Salaam, was coming to the 
University of Michigan to give a 
lecture, I cleared my schedule 
and anticipated the moment I 
would finally meet the person 
whose story I was so familiar 
with. I was eager to absorb all 
the knowledge Salaam acquired 
through 
his 
extraordinary 
experiences, and I awaited a 
stimulating 
discussion 
about 

incarceration 
and 
wrongful 
convictions. 
My 
expectations 
were limited to what I saw in 
the Netflix series and I did not 
anticipate that I would resonate 
with Salaam’s lecture to the 
extent that I did.
Salaam 
began 
his 
lecture 
narrating his perspective of 
the story depicted in When 
They See Us, and sharing other 
aspects of his experience that 
weren’t 
televised. 
He 
then 
went on to discuss his life 
through another lens. Salaam 
is a practicing Muslim and he 
made sure to establish that 
aspect of his identity during the 
lecture. 
Salaam 
emphasized 
his use of religion as a means to 
remain hopeful throughout his 
incarceration and as a reason 
to be grateful for his wrongful 
conviction. He told the audience 
how his name predicted his 
future, sharing the story in the 
Quran about Prophet Yusef, a 

man who was imprisoned for a 
rape he didn’t commit, and was 
later exonerated.
I felt chills throughout my 
body the moment Salaam recited 
the shahada (Muslim profession 
of faith), “la ilaha illa llah.” 
 
Salaam was not ashamed of his 
faith and he did not try to silence 
his spirituality. As a Muslim 
woman of color, I rarely hear my 
identity spoken about in that way. 
Hearing Salaam celebrate my 
religion to a crowd that wasn’t 
predominantly Muslim was so 
encouraging. 
The 
confidence 
he exuded for his Islamic faith 
was especially inspiring to me 
as I have always tried to limit 
outward expression of my faith. 
Though this event made me 
proud of my religion, it also 
led me to realize a key element 
missing from my life. 
This one and a half-hour 
lecture was one of the most 
positive 
representations 
that 
I have had for my religious 
identity in my life. It was also 
one of the only times I have 
seen another Muslim profess 

their faith to a crowd this large, 
aside from a Mosque or Islamic 
event. Salaam’s confidence has 
encouraged me to express my 
love for my religion freely, but 
more importantly, to address the 
lack of accurate representation 
that Muslims face. Growing up, 
I witnessed the media alienate 
Muslim Americans and portray 
them as separate from American 
society. 
After 
listening 
to 
Salaam speak about Islam, I felt 
American. Despite every lie told 
about my religion, the lecture 
made me feel as if I belonged. 
This was an unusual feeling; 
yet, it allowed me to understand 
how important representation 
is for Muslim Americans. In 
order for Muslims to feel that 
they belong in America, they 
must see a diversified, human 
representation of themselves in 
media, politics, and everyday life.
I came to Yusef Salaam’s 
lecture to learn more about one 
of the men featured in When 
They See Us. I was not prepared 
to learn so much about my own 
identity.

When I See You

XINYUAN LUO
MiC Contributor

NOOR MOUGHNI
MiC Columnist

I waded in the ocean as a prayer to wash my soul clean.
I honored the idea that salt might stick to my wounds, might mend the flesh, let me be holy. 
Time sometimes feels as though it slows in South America, like it is consumed by the ebb and flow of my life. 
Like I control it, like maybe I could consume it - let it drip into me. 
I saw the sun rise and set over the Atlantic Ocean. 
This university.
The Brooklyn Bridge. 
I saw it from behind hospital walls. 
Maybe that was home. I spent four seasons here with the sun. 
I felt life itself discard me, venture beyond me dragging me through, and, also, I felt it coming to a complete halt. 
I swam in the Atlantic under the moon. 
I looked in the mirror and I didn’t recognize myself. I looked in the mirror and I fell in love with myself. 
I learned to seek a home in what I value. I learned gratitude. 
That feeling of empty helplessness that sometimes weighs heavy on my stomach, and the euphoria of losing 
myself to the sun and to my soul share the same weight. They create me.
Every second on this earth: lungs inhaling, palms stretched toward the sun, it all matters immensely.
I create my own hope. 
I create my own strength. 
I am the master of my reality.

“What’s the point of being on 
this earth if you’re going to try to 
be someone you’re not?” - Zaya 
Wade
I felt a true form of Black 
joy this past week when I 
watched Zaya Wade speak her 
truth. She’s the daughter of the 
legendary 
actress, 
Gabrielle 
Union, and former NBA player, 
Dwayne Wade. On February 
11th, during an interview on the 
Ellen Degeneres Show, Dwayne 
shared with the world that his 
daughter’s name is now Zaya and 
her pronouns are she/her.
Later that same day, Zaya’s 
mom posted a video of her where 
she shared some powerful words 
with her dad. I admire Zaya’s 
power of knowing who she is 
and being able to express that to 
the world in the face of racism, 
homophobia, 
and 
now 
the 
transphobia that this 12-year-old 
has faced by thousands of people 
online. This is a courageous act 
of bravery. Of love.
What really stood out to 
me about this situation is how 
supportive and understanding 
her parents and siblings are. 
Coming out — or deciding 
not to — is a difficult thing 
for the vast majority of queer 
and trans people, because the 
announcement is not always 
met with acceptance. LGBTQ+ 
youth, 
especially 
young 
transgender folks of color, are 
disproportionately 
abused, 
kicked out and left houseless 
because their families disown 
them. So when Dwayne Wade 
said, “Me and my wife… we are 
proud parents of a child in the 
LGBTQ+ community. And we’re 
proud allies as well. And we take 
our roles and our responsibilities 
as 
parents 
very 
seriously,” 
during his Ellen interview, it felt 
radical to me. When queer and 
trans people are able to stand 
up and defend themselves, it’s 
powerful but it also sets a great 
example for people outside of the 
community to proudly provide 
support as well.
In addition to that, Zaya’s 
brother, 
Zaire, 
posted 
a 
heartwarming Instagram post 
dedicated to his little sister. He 
states, “I’ve told you that I would 
lay my life down to make sure 
you are ten toes down and happy 
on this earth. I don’t care what 

they think Z, you are my best 
friend and I love you kid, and if 
it means anything, just know 
there’s no love lost on this side.” 
Bring out the tissues right now; 
I’m completely in my feelings!
In 
all 
seriousness, 
public 
examples 
of 
unfiltered 
acceptance and love for Black 
folks are what we need to see 
on a regular basis and practice 
in all of our lives. I want to 
clarify that I do not identify as 
transgender or non-binary and 
do not claim these identities 
in any form. However, I do 
know that Black trans women 
are disproportionately victims 
of 
intra-communal 
violence 
and hate. I do hear how some 
Black people, from elders to 
kids, degrade LGBTQ+ folks 
— especially trans folks. The 
transphobic 
aggressions 
that 
Black trans women face, both 
systemically 
and 
personally, 
are not few or far-between. 
This is definitely not a problem 
that is unique to just the Black 
community 
but 
happens 
to 
people within all racial groups. 
This opens up the larger issue 
of highlighting the intersections 
of problems within communities. 
We 
desperately 
need 
the 
privileged 
(yes, 
cisgender 
heterosexual men and women 
of color, you do have privilege) 
to lift up those who are more 
marginalized and silenced. We 
need to pay attention to all issues 
pertaining to gaining power 
by centering those within the 
community who have the least 
power.
That is why seeing an example 
of Black heterosexual, cisgender 
folks fully accepting and loving 
their Black trans family member 
is so beautiful to me. They are 
setting an example for families 
to listen to one another. To take 
the time to educate themselves. 
To have an open mind. They are 
proudly sharing their journey of 
growing as a family and loving 
each 
other 
unconditionally 
through this process. As a 
community as a whole, I believe 
Black folks need to look at the 
ways in which we can do better 
at supporting the marginalized 
people 
within 
our 
already 
marginalized community. We 
have to love one another in 
celebration of our differences. 
Black life can’t matter until ALL 
Black lives matter, including 
Black trans girls. You are not free 
until we’re ALL free.

Unconditional Black Love

Here I am, cooking in my 
apartment’s 
kitchen. 
My 
heart beats joyfully with 
the rhythm of stirring. My 
boyfriend slurps the rib soup 
to check if it’s ready. Wait, 
why did you start eating?
It’s New Year’s Eve.
Here we are, sitting at a 
round table. The steam of 
sticky rice ribs billows from 
the dish. I hear someone’s 
stomach rumbling. Oops, it’s 
mine.
We have no idea what is 
behind the facade of peace. 
Jan. 23, Wuhan closed 
the whole city due to a 
coronavirus 
outbreak. 
I 
was shocked. Never had I 
imagined that China would 
face such a serious condition 
after SARS. Why? Because 
we were told we were safe. 
A few weeks ago, 8 people 
were 
arrested 
in 
Wuhan 
because they were spreading 
“rumors” about the disease. 
What’s next? 14 doctors were 
infected by their patients 
because they knew nothing 
about the virus. 
Here 
we 
are, 
enjoying 
the 
big 
dinner 
while 
checking the news updates. 
A title catches my eye: “An 
employee in China Customs 
retained the donated masks 
for Wuhan.” A few moments 
later, the news disappears.

Quiet.
The same thing happens 
everyday. 
Again. 
AND 
AGAIN. 
The 
death 
toll 
increases everyday, and it 
hurts. What hurts even more 
is 
our 
government 
keeps 
hiding the real number from 
us. What if people find out 
the truth of the death from 
someone they love? In the 
so-called suspected cases, 
how 
many 
of 
them 
are 
already in the past tense?
A citizen in Wuhan visited 
every major hospital in the 
city and posted what he 
saw online. He wanted us to 
know the truth. So I saw.
Body Bags
Crying Faces
Masks
And More Body Bags
That great citizen was 
arrested two weeks later, and 
the police said he was under 

quarantine. So we shut up.

Quiet.
Billions of supplies were 
sent to Wuhan, from all 
over the world. The poorest 
people donated their life 
savings, because they believe 
it can help their siblings a 
little bit. What they don’t 
know is the supplies never 
get to people in need. Wuhan 
Red Cross kept the supplies 
intact in their warehouse. 
Simultaneously, 
countless 
online shops shipped from 
Wuhan 
popped 
up 
from 
nowhere, selling face masks, 
liquid disinfectant and so 
forth.
Here is the best joke of 
the century: I bought the 
supplies I donated.
I saw the health workers 
in the front lines making 
face masks and coveralls 
using plastic bags with their 
ever-whiter hands, bleached 
by 
all 
the 
disinfectant. 
They pleaded for supplies 
with no reply. Another day, 
a 
government 
car 
drove 
right into the Red Cross 
warehouse, took out boxes 
of high-quality face masks; 
a day later, no trace of this 
event could be found. 

Quiet.
Please, 
say 
something, 
before I lose the courage 
to 
believe. 
My 
heart 
is 
bleeding. 
If 
the 
cost 
of 
being quiet is the life of our 
brothers and sisters, why 
shouldn’t we stop it? Is this 
really happening, in the 21st 
century, in China?
I love my country, as much 
as I hate what I see these 
days. The last thing I want 
is to see my beloved country 
building up on lies. We could 
have known the seriousness 
of 
the 
virus 
earlier; 
we 
could have saved more of our 
people; we could have stood 
united.
The 
virus 
outbreak, 
surprisingly, 
unveiled 
the 
true color of this great nation 
— a rickety interior under 
the impressive facade. How 
much time will it take for 
them to realize the so-called 
“stability maintenance” is 
only a placebo, not the real 
medicine? Until then, how 
much more do we still have 
to lose?
I don’t want to be Quiet.

Unsigned editorials reflect the official position of The Daily’s Editorial Board. 
All other signed articles and illustrations represent solely the views of their authors.

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

As both an editorial board and 
as Americans, we understand 
the importance of repudiating 
Trump’s dangerous and divisive 
rhetoric and promoting our true 
American 
strengths, 
tolerance 
and diversity. The endorsement 
process was not easy, as many 
strong candidates would make 
excellent presidents and would 
bring different approaches to the 
position. However, through a 
process of extensive deliberation 
and consideration, the Editorial 
Board has come to a consensus.
The Michigan Daily Editorial 
Board is proud to endorse Sen. 
Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., for the 
strength of his policies on universal 
health care, climate change and 
education, specifically free college 
and the national forgiveness of 
student debt.
As an editorial board composed 
of 
entirely 
college 
students, 
we understand our ability and 
responsibility 
to 
provide 
the 
college 
perspective 
on 
issues 
of consequence to our country, 
making 
our 
endorsement 
of 
Sanders for the 2020 Democratic 
nomination relevant and crucial. 
Additionally, 
this 
perspective 
enhances the impact of Sanders’s 
policies 
on 
education, 
which 
are best known for proposing a 
guaranteed federal provision of 
tuition, as well as debt-free public 
colleges, 
universities, 
HBCUs 
(Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities), 
minority-serving 
institutions and trade schools. As 
students, we find ourselves face-
to-face with the extremely high 
costs of attending university, and 
we applaud Sanders’s commitment 
to making higher education in all 
its forms more accessible for all 
Americans, while also assisting 
those who are out of school and 
suffering from thousands of dollars 
in student debt. The main argument 
against these policies is the financial 
burden placed on taxpayers to 
enact the plans, and while Sanders 
has been transparent about the raise 
in taxes associated with his policies, 
the slight increase 
will 
make 
American 
education 
more 

accessible 
and 
practical, 
supporting and enhancing future 
generations of professionals.
We would be remiss to 
endorse Sanders without 
voicing support for his 
signature 
policy 
issue: 
universal 
single-payer 
health care. Ever since he 
first began campaigning 
for the presidency in 2016, 
Sanders has focused on the 
injustices of the U.S.’s highly 
inequitable health care system. As 
a solution, Sanders has proposed 
a single-payer national insurance 
program which includes zero 
networks, premiums, deductibles 
or copays. This health care plan, 
which would eliminate predatory, 
profit-driven 
health 
insurance 
companies, is at the core of 
Sanders’s philosophy of working for 
the common people and fighting to 
protect them from wealthy interest 
groups. 
However, 
health 
care 
isn’t 
important to just Sanders: The 
public consistently rates health care 
costs as one of their biggest concerns 
and his proposal has resonated 
with many Americans, something 
that has contributed to Sanders’s 
success in the 2020 primaries. In 
2016, the U.S. spent $9,892 per 
capita on health care, by far the 
largest amount of any country in the 
world and double the Organization 
for Economic Cooperation and 
Development average. Meanwhile, 
a survey conducted in January of 
this year revealed that two-thirds 
of Americans believe lowering 
health care costs should be a top 
priority for the government; the 
only more pressing concern being 
protecting 
the 
country 
from 
terrorism. Furthermore, lowering 
healthcare costs is of particular 
concern to Democrats, with 80 
percent believing it should be one of 
the government’s top priorities. 
Additionally, Sanders’s push for 
universal health care is symbolic 
of his ideological consistency and 
his impact on the politics of the 
Democratic Party, both of which 
are significant. First, Sanders has 
consistently advocated for universal 
health care; he introduced a bill 
supporting it as far back as 2011. 
Demonstrated by his continual 
support of Medicare for All, a key 
part of Sanders’s political brand 
is the strength and consistency 
of his convictions. Throughout 
his 
political 
career, 
Sanders 
has continually advocated for 
progressive 
policies 
that 
help 
the working class and has never 
compromised 
these 
positions 
for the sake of electability or 
popularity, something which is 
key to his authenticity. On top of 
that, Sanders’s push for universal 
health care has transformed the 
Democratic 
Party 
and 
stands 
as a tribute to his political clout. 
Beginning with his 2016 campaign, 
Sanders has moved the Democratic 
Party to the left on health care, 
dramatically 
reshaping the 

conversation. 
Sanders’s 
2016 
primary opponent, Hillary Clinton, 
ran on the platform of maintaining 
the Affordable Care Act (ACA)
with slight enhancement; back 
then, Sanders’s plan for universal 
health care was seen as wildly 
radical. Today, even Sanders’s most 
moderate primary opponents, such 
as former Vice Presidnet Joe Biden 
and Mayor of South Bend, Ind., Pete 
Buttigieg, have proposed health 
care plans that would vastly expand 
upon the ACA as much or more 
than Clinton’s plan in 2016. This 
is a tribute to Sanders’s influence 
over health care policy, and more 
broadly, the political trajectory of 
the Democratic Party.
Sanders’s plan for universal 
health care is an example of the 
ambitious, progressive policies the 
U.S. should look to implement going 
forward as the nation grapples with 
inflated health care costs and rising 
inequality. While other candidates 
have also put forward good policies, 
none are as thorough or forward-
thinking as Sanders’s, and his 
ideological consistency provides 
reassurance that his support for the 
program is sincere. 
Finally, something that truly 
sets Sanders apart from the rest of 
the Democratic field is his devotion 
to tackling climate change on a 
large scale. More so than other 
candidates, Sanders appears to 
understand both the catastrophic 
implications of climate change and 
the resources that fighting it will 
require. Sanders’s climate plan, the 
Green New Deal, is by far the most 
ambitious of any of the Democratic 
candidates — it calls for investing 
$16.3 trillion into sustainability, and 
was rated the best in the field by both 
Greenpeace and Data for Progress, 
two prominent progressive activist 
groups. Sanders’s plan calls for the 
creation of 20 million jobs to help 
solve the climate crisis and offers 
substantive, practical answers to 
our crisis while using climate justice 
as a key point. As college students, 
Sanders’s 
devotion 
to 
fighting 
climate 
change 
is 
particularly 
important to us. Young people are 
the ones who will be most impacted 
by climate change, and as a result, it 
is imperative we begin taking drastic 
steps to protect our futures. While 
we acknowledge that Sanders’s 
Green New Deal is not going to be 
implemented in its current form, 
we believe his ambitions meet the 
severity of the climate crisis and 
have the potential to reshape our 
political climate.
The 
2020 
presidential 
election is bound to be the most 
consequential in recent memory. 
Whoever is sworn in on Jan. 20, 
2021, will need to take deliberate 
and decisive action to address the 
challenges that face this nation, 
both foreign and domestic. The 
Michigan Daily Editorial Board 
finds hope in the candidacy of 
Sanders; his commitments to 
universal health care, accessible 
higher education for all and 
climate justice set him apart from 
the rest of the Democratic field. 
While we urge the University 
of Michigan community to vote 
for Sanders in the Michigan 
Democratic primary, we recognize 
that democracy is strongest when 
everyone’s voices are heard. We 
encourage all readers to vote on 
March 10.

Stamps should stop babysitting college students
T

he instant I became 
eligible my first year, 
right after the Winter 
2019 semester, I transferred 
from the Stamps School of 
Art & Design to the College 
of Literature, Science and the 
Arts. If someone asks why I 
decided to quit art, I would say 
it was because of the way the 
Art & Design School treats its 
students. Some students refer 
to the Art & Design School as a 
high school, mainly due to the 
excessive 
requirements 
and 
the absence of student input, 
neither of which belong in 
college education.
Compared to other colleges 
at the University of Michigan, 
the 
Art 
& 
Design 
School 
sets an exorbitant amount of 
requirements. At orientation, 
new first-year students are given 
lists of courses with designated 
sections 
highlighted. 
They 
are taken to a computing site 
the same day and required to 
register for class sections exactly 
as shown on the highlighted 
lists. Those are “foundation 
courses” required of every first-
year student and comprise 10 
and 13 credit hours for the first 
two semesters, respectively. The 
foundation courses are different 
from regular requirements as 
in other colleges; withdrawing 
from courses like the assigned 
foundations 
on 
a 
set 
time 
frame could result in academic 
probation, which might prevent 
students from transferring to 
other colleges in the university.
The biggest problem here 
is that students have no say in 
selecting times and instructors 
in their first semester. The 
schedules, which the school 
claim 
to 
be 
random, 
are 
distributed 
unfairly. 
Some 
end up with 8:30 a.m. classes 
Monday 
through 
Thursday, 
while others have no morning 
class at all, but rather night 
classes that end around 8 p.m. 
However, class scheduling is 
just a nuisance compared to 
more serious issues. When it 
comes to instructors, grades 
become an issue. For any one 
course, 
grade 
distribution 
can differ starkly by section 
and instructor. Unlike most 
LSA lectures, where multiple 

graduate student instructors 
gather with professors and set 
standardized grading scales, 
most Art & Design School 
courses are run completely 
by section instructors with 
unchecked 
discretion 
in 
grading. Every instructor has a 
different level of expectations 
and a different grading policy, 
like attendance policies that 
drop 1/3 of a letter grade 
for every absence, with no 
exception for excused absences 
or doctor’s notes. This was the 
case in my Fall 2018 section of 
Studio: 2D. Students rarely get 
to change their schedules once 
the lists are assigned, which 
leads to the next problem.

I remember my first year of 
college as an endless stream of 
“no.”Every time I visited my 
advisor or one of the deans, I was 
never allowed to swap sections, 
drop foundation courses or even 
take more electives. Though all 
of these requests are usually not 
a problem in other University 
colleges, the Art & Design 
School is unnecessarily strict 
and rigid. While personally 
fighting the school to make these 
decisions possible, I found the 
school’s structure represented 
by 
the 
assistant 
dean 
for 
undergraduate programs to be 
somewhat 
authoritative. 
On 
Nov. 7, 2018, as I presented my 
concern of students not being 
able to choose their sections, 
resulting in unfair grading, she 
responded verbatim, “That’s the 
way it works.” She then insisted 
that one who disagrees with 
the school’s policy would better 
“withdraw out of U of M.” This 
is related to why many of the 
Art & Design students feel they 
are treated as subjects who do 
as told with little to no input. 

What differentiates a college 
from a high school is student 
agency. College students are 
adults with the full capacity 
to design their own paths 
academically and personally. 
Setting 
almost 
everything 
in a student’s schedule is far 
from what a university would 
normally do to students. This 
is especially upsetting given 
the Art & Design School is an 
art school, aiming to educate 
not only scholars but artists. It 
is rather ridiculous to expect 
anyone 
to 
be 
creative 
or 
artistic under such a rigid and 
authoritative system. The most 
common answer given in return 
to the above complaints is that 
foundations are just for the 
first year, and students can be 
patient until they get to upper-
division.
Unfortunately, 
however, 
not all students are “patient” 
enough to endure all of the 
above. In fact, the Art & Design 
School 
loses 
a 
significant 
number of students, and artists, 
just a year after welcoming 
them. According to the Office 
of the Registrar, 21 out of 154 
Class of 2022 students left the 
Art & Design School after the 
first year, and the number is 
27 out of 158 for the Class of 
2021. This data gauges post-
first-year drop-outs only in 
order to exclude other drop-out 
factors such as the sophomore 
review. It is striking that 14 
and 17 percent, approximately a 
sixth of students each year, left 
the Art & Design School after 
finishing their first year. They 
generally choose to transfer to 
other colleges in the university 
or other institutions, or simply 
“withdraw out of U of M,” 
adhering to the assistant dean’s 
suggestion. Due to University 
policy, right after the first year 
is the earliest time students 
looking to leave the Art & 
Design School but remain at 
U-M can transfer cross-campus. 
Therefore, not all students are 
willing to wait. In order to stop 
losing passionate young artists, 
it’s time to stop babysitting 
college students.

The case for prison reform

T

he United States is a 
world leader — in its 
incarceration 
rates. 
The U.S. represents 4 percent 
of the world population but 
holds 22 percent of the world’s 
prisoners, 
a 
clear 
indicator 
of how problematic the U.S.’s 
mass incarceration crisis is. 
This statistic raises all kinds 
of questions. Are Americans 
inherently 
more 
aggressive 
than other nationalities? If not, 
why has the U.S. had one of the 
world’s highest incarceration 
rates for decades?
In general, the American 
system is set up to create 
career criminals. The economic 
disparity in the U.S. is far greater 
than in most Western countries. 
David Cole, a law professor at 
Georgetown University, explains 
in his book “No Equal Justice” 
how the U.S. in effect operates 
two distinct criminal justice 
systems: one for wealthy people 
and another for poor people and 
people of color. The wealthy can 
access a vigorous system filled 
with constitutional protections 
for defendants; however, this 
system is largely reserved for the 
wealthy alone. The experiences 
of poor and minority defendants 
within 
the 
criminal 
justice 
system often differ substantially 
from the idealized model due 
to a number of factors, each 
of which contributes to the 
overrepresentation 
of 
such 
groups in the system. 
Additionally, when and if 
someone is released from prison, 
it is extremely hard for them to 
get a job. This can result in the 
individual 
committing 
more 
crimes and getting a harsher 
sentence 
the 
second 
time 
around. This eventually leads 
to a lot less social and economic 
mobility, so the poor continue 
to stay poor. Broadly speaking, 
the rich are not affected by 
the prison system to the same 
extent that minorities and the 
poor are, and they even have the 
opportunity to invest in prisons 
and make a profit. 

This 
reality 
goes 
hand-
in-hand 
with 
the 
protest 
school of thought that argues 
human rights law is hijacked 
by the elite and there will 
always be further injustice. 
Unfortunately, it is the rich 
and powerful who dictate the 
direction of laws, including 
those for prison reform. This is 
a problem because if something 
doesn’t affect a specific group 
much, it does not give it much 
thought. 

While the prison system 
is unjust, it also entraps a 
disproportionately high rate of 
Black men. African Americans 
make up 33 percent of the 
correctional 
population, 
yet 
12 
percent 
of 
the 
general 
population. There is clearly a 
system of legal discrimination 
and segregation in this country 
that 
has 
occurred 
due 
to 
the war on drugs and mass 
incarceration. White people are 
not better behaviorally than 
Black people. For example, 
African Americans and white 
people use drugs at similar 
rates. In the 2015 National 
Survey on Drug Use and Health, 
about 17 million whites and 
four million African Americans 
reported having used an illicit 
drug within the last month. 
However, 
the 
imprisonment 
rate of African Americans for 
drug charges is almost six times 
that of whites. One of every 
three African American men 
could expect to go to prison in 
his lifetime, compared to one 
of every seventeen white men. 

According to The Sentencing 
Project, 
white 
Americans 
overestimate the proportion of 
crime committed by African 
Americans, while failing to 
realize “that their communities 
are disproportionately victims 
of crime and discount the 
prevalence 
of 
bias 
in 
the 
criminal justice system.”
This relates back to the protest 
school of thought because it 
argues that once someone has 
a certain human right, they 
enjoy it for themselves, but 
no longer care whether or not 
others have that same right. 
White 
individuals 
should 
fight 
for 
African 
American 
human rights until the Black 
community can enjoy the same 
rights as the white community. 
There are, as The Sentencing 
Project notes, “disproportionate 
levels of police contact with 
African Americans” compared 
to other races. Police resources 
are purposely put toward low-
income areas with high minority 
numbers where they assume 
crime will be committed. This 
increases 
police 
brutality 
among the African American 
population and creates a culture 
that leads African Americans to 
be seen as criminals. 
For this country to truly 
make meaningful reforms to 
this atrocious system, there has 
to be an acknowledgment of the 
racial and ethnic disparities 
that are occurring in the prison 
system and the public must 
focus its attention on how to 
reduce 
these 
disparities. 
It 
is the U.S.’s responsibility to 
develop training to alleviate the 
influence of implicit racial bias 
at every level of the criminal 
justice system: among police 
officers, 
public 
defenders, 
prosecutors, 
judges, 
jury 
members and parole boards.

for President Barack Obama

You’re probably aware of the 
trope where male writers try 
to write female characters but 
seem to think that body weight 
and breast size are adequate 
substitutes for personality traits. 
If you’re not familiar with this, 
take a few minutes to browse 
@menwritewomen, 
a 
Twitter 
account that could be sustained 
for weeks solely on excerpts 
from David Bergen’s upcoming 
book, “Here the Dark.” Through 
a novella and a collection of short 
stories, “Here the Dark” explores 
the stories, according to the 
inside cover, of “men and boys 
bewildered by their circumstances 
and swayed by desire, surprised by 
love and by their capacity for both 
tenderness and violence.” While 
this description is shallow, I could 
not find enough potential value 
or meaning in “Here the Dark” to 
allow me to write a worthwhile 
alternative.
Most of the stories in “Here the 
Dark” follow some variation of 
this predictable formula: Man is 
troubled. Man meets woman. Man 
is no longer troubled. Rinse and 
repeat. The man usually fixates 
on some perceived deficiency 
in the woman and then makes a 
point to show that he doesn’t care 
about it or loves her in spite of it. 
For instance, in “Never Too Late,” 
the main character, Bev, falls in 
love with a woman named Janice, 
who uses a wheelchair. On their 
first date, Janice notes, “you’re 
not particular, I like that,” later 
clarifying, “you’re not put off by 
a gimp,” to which Bev responds, 
“never 
crossed 
my 
mind,” 
essentially pulling an “I don’t see 
color,” but with disability. 
In “How Can n Men Share a 
Bottle of Vodka” (this title only 
makes marginally more sense 
after reading the story), an 
alcoholic teacher meets Jennifer, 

a coworker of his. They become 
friends after he tells the story of 
his wife cheating and leaving him. 
This is followed by quite possibly 
the worst sentence in the entire 
book: 
“Why I related this all to 
Jennifer 
Donne 
was 
not 
a 
surprise. I needed a gentle breast 
to fall upon and Jennifer was both 
gentle and ample, for she was 
a large woman, fat some might 
say, though I would not describe 
her so, perhaps because I found 
her attractive, and later, after we 
became lovers, I discovered that 
desire will always surprise us.” 
The 
narrator 
brings 
up 
Jennifer’s weight several more 
times, assuring himself that he 

finds her attractive in spite of it. 
I tried and failed to read these 
stories as precautionary tales. By 
the end of the story, the narrator 
shakes his drinking habit, and 
it’s implied that meeting Jennifer 
motivated him to do so. How 
exactly this happens is unclear.
The not-so-subtle subtext with 
stories like these is that the main 
character is settling by getting 
with a woman he perceives as 
having some sort of deficiency 
(overweight, disabled, etc.), but 
in accepting this, he is at peace 
with himself. Women in these 
stories are little more than plot 
devices to prompt some vague 
sense of growth in the male main 
character. 
They’re 
portrayed 

as having some quasi-mystical 
wisdom that is never explicitly 
expressed, but instead seems to 
be imparted to the main character 
via osmosis over the course of 
the story. Needless to say, most 
of “Here the Dark” would fail the 
Bechdel Test spectacularly.
The book ends with a novella 
told from the point of view of a 
girl growing up in a conservative 
Mennonite 
community. 
She’s 
expected to dress modestly, to not 
question the Bible, her parents, 
etc., but eventually she gains some 
freedom. This story is a boring and 
empty rendition of much better 
feminist narratives. Not knowing 
much about the world, the girl 
feels, at least in the beginning of 
the story, that she has no identity. 
It’s quite fitting that the one story 
told from a woman’s point of 
view is about a character whose 
primary personality trait is that 
she doesn’t have one.
I should be fair and point out 
one of the book’s few strengths. 
Bergen writes very clearly; I 
imagine he would do well writing 
assembly instructions for IKEA 
furniture. His clear prose does, 
however, end up being a double-
edged sword since it removes 
any doubt about the book’s 
shallowness. “Here the Dark” 
claims to “deftly render complex 
moral ambiguities,” but more 
accurately it makes the moves 
of narrative resolution without 
actually 
saying 
anything 
or 
revealing any unexpected nuance.
If you can forget the fact 
that many people had to read 
and approve the book before it 
could’ve been published, “Here 
the Dark” is actually really 
funny. Large portions of it feel as 
though a fourteen-year-old tried 
explaining sex to an alien and 
then asked said alien to write a 
bunch of sex scenes. If there’s 
anything to gain from “Here the 
Dark,” it’s that no one should be 
discouraged if they can’t get their 
book published, because quality 
evidently isn’t a must to sell copies.

In ‘Here the Dark,’ male 
writer syndrome strikes

BOOK REVIEW
BOOK REVIEW

When someone talks about “the 
arts,” the first thing that comes 
to mind is usually some form of 
self-expression, like painting or 
photography. Very rarely do we 
talk about art in the same breath 
as running, but why not? We’re 
exploring 
this 
question 
with 
“Daily Arts Runs a Marathon” 
and opening with an exploration 
of what “running” is. Fortunately, 
The 
Ann 
Arbor 
Marathon 
happens at the end of March and 
offers a relay that four writers 
will be running, in the hopes of 
figuring out their (maybe artistic) 
relationship with running. In the 
meantime, we’re training, we’re 
writing and we’re eating our 
bananas. 

 What exactly is running 
anyway? We all have our own 
preconceived notions — some 
people dread it, others embrace 
it and some only tolerate it. As 
one of the more accessible sports 
out there, it seems absurd that 
more people aren’t always just 
on a run. More often than not, 
though, discussing my running 
habits with others often results in 
dejected “I could never do that” 
statements or a vehement “God, I 
hate running.” And maybe these 
people have a point — running 
can be pretty awful, especially if 
someone does it solely as a means 
to work out. 
But, subconsciously, I think 
we all love running. Maybe not 
the actual physical act of it, but 
the general theme is popular 
throughout 
art. 
Take 
“Lady 
Bird,” for example. The 2017 film 
follows Christine, or Lady Bird 

(Saoirse 
Ronan, 
“Brooklyn”), 
as 
she 
desperately 
tries 
to 
understand her role in her family 
and in the world as a whole. 
Though she never actually takes 
up track, Christine is running 
throughout the film — from her 
family, from her real friends and, 
eventually, from Sacramento. It’s 
an age-old story that proves just 
how much people, particularly 
teenagers, actually do like to run. 
And while running away is 
an enticing thought, running to 
something, or someone, is just 
as popular of a theme. Romantic 
comedies and the Valentine’s Day 
movie industry wouldn’t be the 
same without it. The endings of 
these films always feature some 
sort of sprint through a train 
station to a character’s true love 
and, honestly, some would have 
way happier endings if they just 
went on a run. Not only would 
that sprint through the airport be 
just that much easier, but running 
is a really nice time to reflect and, 
most likely, that sprint wouldn’t 
happen in the first place because 
the protagonists would have 
had time to grapple with their 
emotions. But where’s the drama 
in that? 
Running 
has 
relationships 
with art beyond film, though. 
What a person chooses to listen 
to while on a run can tell you a 
lot about them. Curating a good 
playlist is an art in and of itself, 
but add in the extra layer of 
needing to maintain motivation 
throughout a run and you have a 
dynamic connection that is just as 
flexible as your relationship with 
running. So, what makes a good 
running playlist? Spotify offers 
flexible playlists that match the 
song speed to the pace of your 
run, an interesting feature and 
a good place to start if a blank 

playlist is intimidating. I enjoy 
starting with a little Beyoncé, 
something I can sing along to 
that’s just distracting enough 
that I’m able to enjoy the burning 
in my lungs but ignore the ache in 
my knees. 
Greek sculpture is another 
format in which we see an 
obsession with running. Though 
the closest these sculptures ever 
get to actually depicting someone 
running is a man throwing a 
disc (“Discobulus”), it’s more a 
fixation on the human form that 
connects these two mediums. 
Greek sculpture is notorious 
for its detailed depictions of the 
human body — from the soft 
curves of Nike’s thighs to David’s 
hardened jawline, the ancient 
Greeks did not shy away from 
trying to understand the human 
form. Similarly, running forces us 
to become more familiar with our 
bodies than we already are; we 
come to understand how a fast 
mile might affect our knees and 
what a strong stride looks like 
once we’re in a groove. Running 
isn’t about your pace, much like 
Greek sculpture isn’t about the 
marble. It’s about how we take 
these starting materials and turn 
them into something beautiful.
So, is it even possible to really, 
truly, unironically like to run? 
Obviously yes, otherwise there 
wouldn’t be such a huge market 
for the sport. But when you get 
down to it, running is a tool we 
can use to connect with ourselves 
and the world around us. And 
if that’s too much of a clichéd 
explanation of what running can 
mean for people, then consider 
this: Running is an art. Whether 
we’re looking at the sport itself 
or its presence in film and music, 
it’s impossible to avoid it. And, 
honestly, why would you want to?

ANN ARBOR MARATHON PREVIEW SERIES

Sometimes, when you pair 
up a producer and a rapper who 
each have their own signature 
sound, you can immediately 
imagine what their collaboration 
might sound like. If I said Metro 
Boomin and Lil Wayne were 
dropping 
a 
single, 
anybody 
familiar with both artists could 
already hear the hazy, southern 
rap banger forming in their 
head.
But an EP with two of the 
most versatile artists in the 
rap game — Denzel Curry and 
Kenny Beats? That’s a different 
beast. 
That’s 
unpredictable. 
That could mean anything. On 
UNLOCKED, it meant an off-
the-wall, Madvillain-meets-Wu-
Tang-type, 
vintage-veneered 
rap album that paves the path 
for hip hop of the new decade.
For 
Kenny 
Beats, 
the 
producer whose motto is “Don’t 
overthink shit,” UNLOCKED 
feels meticulously pored over, 
highly 
polished, 
pruned, 
tweaked and trimmed. If you 
take 
Kenny’s 
philosophy 
to 
mean trusting in simplicity, then 
UNLOCKED would be Kenny 
throwing that philosophy in the 

trash. There’s a clear complexity 
to the numerous interweaved 
sounds 
and 
samples, 
so 
smoothly integrated that I kept 
catching more I didn’t hear 
on the fourth, fifth and sixth 
listen. But if you look at Kenny’s 
motto differently, I can see it: 
Other producers might feel 
nervous about overproducing 
the project. Kenny Beats does 
not overthink it. He puts his 

footprint in between every line 
from Denzel Curry. Despite that 
density, every beat on the eight-
track EP is clean.

masterpiece Madvillainy is an 
easy one to make when you hear 
all the vintage samples layered 
throughout the EP, but the 
inspiration is truly evident in 

Denzel Curry’s contributions. 
Curry 
plays 
with 
listener 
expectations 
in 
his 
rhyme 
schemes all over the EP. It’s a 
move straight out of MF DOOM’s 
playbook. 
On 
“So.Incredible.
pkg,” Curry raps, “Like, who 
brings the composition to the 
competition? / There’s gonna 
be some consequences when 
I — (Look out).” The way he 
drops the line before finishing 
the 
rhyme 
recalls 
DOOM’s 
ingenious line on “Great Day” 
from 
Madvillainy: 
“Spit 
so 
many verses sometimes my jaw 
twitches / One thing this party 
could use is more … ahem / 
Booze.”
In that sense, Curry’s bars 
take 
inspiration 
from 
his 
forefathers, including the clever 
intricacy of MF DOOM and the 
razor-sharp edge of Wu-Tang. 
Even the scream-along chorus 
on “DIET_” feels characteristic 
of DMX. Still, the brand of 
aggression he brings to each bar 
makes his raps his own. “You act 
so hard, you should thank the 
Academy” is so straightforward 
and gutting that if I didn’t know 
better, I would guess it came 
from a Method Man track.

Curry and Beats unlock 
full potential on new EP

HELP WANTED

In an epic creative journey 
that began right here at Ann 
Arbor’s folk music venue The 
Ark four years ago, singer-
songwriter 
duo 
Jim 
and 
Sam decided to push their 
musical limits and attempt the 
unthinkable: perform one show 
every day for the entirety of 
2017.
The duo, who got married just 
three months before tackling 
their 
one-show-per-day 
challenge, felt frustrated while 
struggling to gain an audience 
in today’s hyper-digital music 
industry. They were “trying to 
crack...the code of the internet” 
in which musicians resort to 
“modern ways to connect with 
people,” as Jim said in a phone 
interview with The Michigan 
Daily. Feeling disillusioned by 
an increasingly commercialistic 
music industry and eager to 
break out of their creative rut, 
the musical pair had to channel 
the very authentic nature that 
typifies their folksy, acoustic 
sound and rely on the goodness 
of people in order to actualize 
their daring idea.
Jim and Sam’s story is one 
of serendipity — starting their 
365-day tour at The Ark was 
completely 
coincidental 
but 
ultimately 
offered 
them 
a 

benevolent beginning to their 
risky journey.
“(The Ark) being a volunteer-
run venue, there’s a heart there 
that was just really special,” 
Jim said. “Everybody is warm 
and supportive.” 
As they took off on a year of 
constant performances, they 
soon realized that the warmth 

and genuine kindness they 
first experienced at The Ark 
extended beyond the limits of 
Ann Arbor. When describing 
the ways in which they cut 
corners and explored creative 
avenues in order to actually 
perform one show every day, 

Sam remembered that much 
of their success came about 
because of “ ... (the goodness 
of) all the different people who 
(came out of the woodwork) and 
said ‘yes’ to us.”
The duo found immense 
support 
from 
numerous 
individuals 
across 
North 
America who stepped up to 
book venues, find audiences 
and do just about anything 
they could to elevate the pair 
and create a reality from their 
ambitious idea. 
While on their year-long tour, 
Jim and Sam were challenged 
to connect to each audience in 
vulnerable ways and lean into 
the musical spontaneity that 
Jim recalled as “ ... trying to get 
to know a room full of people, 
asking them how they’re doing, 
and then finding a song of ours 
that fits the situation.”
Unlike 
the 
meticulously 
choreographed 
and 
hyper-
glamorized 
musical 
performances characteristic of 
today’s popular artists, Jim and 
Sam relied on their authentic 
energy and sincere passion for 
connecting with others in their 
musical pursuits. They offered 
a year’s worth of audiences the 
same kind of organically heart-
felt entertainment that thrives 
in venues like The Ark.

A serendipitious reunion

ASCAP

GRACE TUCKER
Daily Arts Writer

On Aug. 12, 2017, a neo-
Nazi drove a car into a crowd 
of counterprotestors at the 
Unite the Right rally. One 
woman was killed. On Aug. 15, 
2017, President Trump held 
a press conference following 
the attack and made the now 
infamous statement: “You also 
had people that were very fine 
people, on both sides.”
“Hunters” remembers this. 
And it wants you to know just 
who exactly is on each side. In 
a political climate marked by 
“us versus them” rhetoric, this 
series demands you to choose 
who is with you and who is 
against you. As the United 
States 
faces 
the 
growing 
presence of racism and anti-
Semitism, “Hunters” reminds 
us that “never again” may not 
be as true as we’d hope.
Set 
in 
1977 
New 
York, 
“Hunters” centers on Jewish 
teenager Jonah Heidelbaum 
(Logan Lerman, “The Perks of 
Being a Wallflower”) following 
the murder of his grandmother 
Ruth (Jeannie Berlin, “The 

Heartbreak Kid”) who moved 
to the U.S. after surviving 
imprisonment at Auschwitz. 
When Jonah discovers Ruth’s 
murder may be connected to 
a network of Nazis operating 
within the United States, he is 
recruited by Ruth’s friend from 

the camps and now-millionaire 
Meyer Offerman (Al Pacino, 
“Serpico”) to join a group of 
revenge-seeking vigilantes. 
This 
group, 
the 
titular 
Hunters, is comprised of skilled 
individuals 
devoted 
to 
the 
identification and destruction 
of former German officers. 

As the Hunters unravel the 
network of Nazis, FBI Agent 
Millie Morris (Jerrika Hinton, 
“Here and Now”) investigates 
the murders they commit and 
realizes their victims may be 
part of a wider conspiracy 
that 
implicates 
the 
United 
States 
government 
and 
its 
most 
secretive 
institutions. 
Soon, Jonah’s descent into this 
hidden world of amorality and 
crime continues as he struggles 
to identify what good he can do 
amid darkness and evil. 
Though 
“Hunters” 
is 
a 
work 
of 
historical 
fiction, 
much of the series is inspired 
by true events, including the 
existence 
of 
Nazi 
hunters 
and 
the 
U.S. 
government’s 
recruitment of Nazi scientists 
in 
Operation 
Paperclip, 
which placed German war 
criminals 
in 
positions 
at 
NASA, 
the 
Department 
of 
Defense, 
multiple 
branches 
of the military and other 
organizations. 
Though 
the 
U.S. of “Hunters” differs from 
ours, the similarities make the 
violent, deeply disturbing show 
even more shocking. 

‘Hunters’ knows that it’s 
high time we chose a side

WEST LAFAYETTE — The 

Michigan men’s basketball team has a 

roster that knows how to win.

That is, anywhere but West 

Lafayette.

Even under the guidance of senior 

captains Zavier Simpson and Jon 

Teske — who have claimed a pair of 

Big Ten Tournament titles and made a 

trip to the Final Four — the Wolverines 

entered this season without a road win 

against Purdue since 2014.

But on Saturday, Michigan changed 

that. Spurred by junior forward Isaiah 

Livers’ return from an ankle injury, the 

Wolverines topped the Boilermakers 

(14-14, 7-10), 71-63, securing their fifth-

straight win.

For Michigan (18-9 overall, 9-7 Big 

Ten), it’s more evidence of a team 

peaking at the right time. The trend 

has become synonymous with the 

program. Over the last four years, the 

Wolverines’ combined February record 

is 22-6. Saturday’s win came inside a 

packed house at Mackey Arena, where 

the Boilermakers had previously run 

Virginia, Michigan State and Iowa off 

the court.

Michigan’s current five-game 

winning streak is its longest since 

opening the season with seven 

consecutive victories — a stretch 

highlighted by a Battle 4 Atlantis 

championship victory over now-No. 2 

Gonzaga.

“In the Bahamas, we looked like an 

offensive team,” associate head coach 

Phil Martelli said. “Now, I think we 

look like a winning team.”

If anything, Saturday serves as a 

measuring stick. Against a team trying 

to keep its NCAA Tournament hopes 

off life support, Michigan dominated 

much of the first half. Less than two 

months after surrendering 36 points 

to Purdue center Trevion Williams, 

the Wolverines forced him into an 

inefficient 8-of-21 shooting 

performance.

On the other end, it didn’t take long 

for Michigan to overcome its 3-of-14 

start from beyond the arc. A trio of 

three consecutive 3-pointers — one 

from Teske and two from freshman 

wing Franz Wagner — helped inflate 

the Wolverines’ lead from six to 13 in a 

three-minute span. 

Purdue coach Matt Painter called a 

timeout to curb the 3-point barrage, but 

once the Boilermakers began running 

shooters off the arc, Michigan made 

a dent in the paint. Wagner beat his 

defender backdoor for an easy dunk 

and, less than a minute later, Teske put 

an exclamation point on the first half 

with a two-handed flush of his own, 

giving the Wolverines a 15-point lead at 

the break.

The second half followed a similar 

script, with Michigan shutting the door 

on any comeback bid before it could 

become a legitimate threat. Wagner 

led the way with a 5-for-6 second-half 

shooting performance en route to 

a career-high 22 points 

— halting a cold 

spell that saw him shoot just 35 percent 

over the last six games.

“My shot was falling, finally,” Wagner 

said. “I’m working hard in practice. I’m 

taking shots I’m comfortable taking 

(and) taking them with confidence. 

That’s what the coaching staff wants 

from us. I think it’s important to keep 

doing that even when the percentages 

aren’t where you want them to be.”

Added Martelli: “Other than 

strength, I don’t know what isn’t a 

perfect basketball player about him. 

… If he was a kid that played (high 

school basketball) in Michigan last 

year, he would’ve been a McDonald’s 

All-American. … He’s one of the best 

freshmen in America.”

Only one month ago, Michigan 

was 0-5 in true road environments, 

wondering if a trip to Lincoln might 

doom its season in January. It has since 

won all four of its games away from 

Ann Arbor, finding 

different ways 

to get it 

done almost every time.

On Wednesday, the Wolverines 

handed Rutgers its first home loss of 

the season. First-year coach Juwan 

Howard attributed it to his team’s 

“grit,” adding that it “comes from 

within your heart and within your 

mindset.”

Four days later, his group 

convincingly beat a Purdue team that 

was previously 10-3 on its own floor.

And now, with the calendar less than 

a week away from flipping to March, 

Michigan is in full stride. 

“The first statement to them in 

July was that under this system, they 

were going to learn to share the game,” 

Martelli said. “And that’s what we 

do — we share the game. … This team 

now has complete trust in the way 

they’re being taught, the way they’re 

being asked to play and they trust each 

other.”

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

O

n Feb. 3rd, Franz Wagner 
came out for his media 
availability and settled 
near the back 
right corner 
of the Crisler 
Center media 
room. Michi-
gan was com-
ing off a win 
at Madison 
Square Gar-
den. Wagner 
had just been 
named Big Ten 
Freshman of 
the Week. 
You never know how those 
scrums will go; which ones will 
descend to meaningless platitudes 
and which ones will lend some 
insight into a person.
That day you could tell Wagner 
was just starting to figure it all out. 
How to play college basketball. 
How to be a college student. How 
to interact with the media. He 
opened up about some of the subtle 
differences between the Euro 
game and Big Ten basketball, how 
he’s evolved as a player and some 
of the challenges he’d faced. 
“I think I’m starting — not 
starting,” Wagner said then, inter-
rupting his sentence. “You can see 
I’m more comfortable as the sea-
son continues to go on.”
A year ago, Wagner was a 
17-year-old playing professional 
basketball in a country over 4,000 
miles away. Then, right before 
making a life-altering decision, the 
coach he’d communicated with 
for years picked up and left town. 
Within two months, the new 
coach secured his commitment 
anyway, undoubtedly with some 
help from big brother. Then, right 
before a freshman season that 
could’ve vaulted him to the NBA, 
Wagner, bearing a reputation as a 
deadeye shooter, broke his shoot-
ing wrist.
His return came against Iowa 
State in the Bahamas. Then came 
North Carolina. Then Gonzaga. 
Then at Louisville. Then two Big 
Ten games. Then Oregon. He shot 

just 41 percent from the field — for 
a team that, fairly or otherwise, 
needed him to be more than he 
was. 
Since, Wagner has become an 
irreplaceable piece for this team, 
while the absent — though obvi-
ous — upside bubbles just below 
the surface. Michigan has played 
well, then not-so-well and now is 
rounding into form once again. All 
the while, the best version of this 
Michigan team — one with the tal-
ent to be the best in the conference 
— always required the best version 
of Wagner. His impending ascen-
sion always offered the Wolverines 
a level they could not otherwise 
unlock.
Well, we might be getting set to 
find out what that looks like.

Saturday against Purdue, Wag-
ner scored a career-high 22 points 
in a 71-63 win over the Boilermak-
ers. He’s shot 52 percent from the 
field and 39 percent from 3-point 
range on 10.5 field goal attempts 
per game over the last four games, 
averaging 13.8 points. 
His length and defensive acuity 
have already proven irreplaceable 
for a team with scant wing depth. 
If his shooting is here to stay, we’re 
talking about one of the two most 
valuable guys on the team. A true 
two-way, all-Big Ten-level wing.
“Heard it earlier, for a fresh-
man, he’s basically considered a 
five-star,” Michigan coach Juwan 
Howard said after Saturday’s 
win over Purdue. “But he’s from 
Europe. From a guy who com-

petes, played in big games, played 
professionally over in Europe. 
Not afraid of the moment, but also 
skilled.”
One of the adjustments Wag-
ner said he needed to make in the 
transition from Germany to the 
Big Ten was mental. He’d come in 
often deferential to his teammates, 
used to the team-style European 
game. He took fewer than 10 shots 
in eight of his first 10 games. Slow-
ly, he started to look for his; that 
process becoming less mental and 
more instinctual.
“Being aggressive doesn’t mean 
you take the next shot, but maybe 
looking to score, looking for your 
teammates on the next play, try-
ing to do something with the ball,” 
he said. “That’s something that, 

in Europe, you play more with a 
team.”
In a week it will be March. 
In two weeks, Michigan’s regu-
lar season will be over. In three 
weeks, it will know its NCAA 
Tournament destination. Wagner 
is the biggest variable dictating 
two divergent paths for this team: 
one that plateaus and ultimately 
lacks the offensive potency to be a 
real contender or one that threat-
ens for the conference tournament 
title, nabs a high seed and becomes 
a red-hot, trendy Final Four pick.
If the latter comes to fruition, 
Wagner will become a national 
name. The charismatic, ener-
getic German freshman — who, it 
should be noted, will start appeal-
ing to NBA teams sooner than 

later. The first recruit who put 
faith in the Juwan Howard era. 
The stories practically write them-
selves. And, oh yeah, did you know 
he has a brother?
As the conversation then wound 
down, I asked Franz, given the fact 
Moe loved the pomp and circum-
stance of March more than anyone 
I’d covered, whether he had that 
trait, too.
“Obviously there’s something 
different to March Madness and 
college basketball in March,” he 
said. “… As the season starts to 
come to an end, that’s when most 
players have their fun.”

MARCOVITCH

EMMA MATI/Daily
Freshman wing Franz Wagner has averaged 13.8 points over his last four games, helping lead Michigan to a five-game win streak after its NCAA Tournament hopes were briefly in jeopardy last month.

Teske helps lift Wolverines in win

Center Jon Teske’s teammates 
nicknamed him Big Sleep. It’s 
a reflection of the seven-foot 
senior’s quiet demeanor off the 
court. But recently, he’s been 
relatively quiet on the court as 
well. 
Going into the Michigan men’s 
basketball team’s game at Purdue 
on Saturday, Teske averaged just 
over five points a game over the 
previous five games, shooting just 
28 percent from the field. It’s a 
significant drop-off for someone 
who averaged 14 points a game 
over the first nine games of the 
season.
“I just have to stay confident in 
my shot,” Teske said last Tuesday 
when asked about his struggles 
on offense. “When I get the ball 
down low, just go up strong. A 
lot of teams, they game-plan 
around me. So my job is just to 
either get a shot up or kick it 
back out for an open look. But my 
teammates trust me to make the 
right decision. I just have to stay 
confident in my shot. … I’m just 
playing through it.”
But against the Boilermakers, 
bolstered by the confidence of 
having scored 18 points in the 

two teams’ January meeting, 
Teske finally seemed to find his 
spark again. He put up 11 points 
— the most he’s scored in almost 
a month. He avoided foul trouble 
(which has been an issue in games 
at times this season) and notched 
five rebounds and four assists on 
the day.
And on defense, Teske was part 
of an effort that held sophomore 
forward Trevion Williams to 
39.7 percent from the field, a far 
cry from the 36 points he scored 
previously.
“This came from the defensive 
side of the ball,” associate head 
coach Phil Martelli said after 
Saturday’s game. “The tribute 
goes to (Michigan coach Juwan 
Howard), 
and 
to 
(assistant 
coach Saddi Washington), as the 
defensive coordinator, insisting 
on shrinking the floor. Insisting. … 
“I said, when we were in 
a slump, that if we can start 
guarding the ball, it’ll go alright. 
That wasn’t a thing of beauty 
offensively, 
obviously, 
in 
the 
second half. We’re maybe not built 
that way. But the defensive side of 
the ball? 
“We could’ve stayed out there 
another 20 minutes. They just 
were not going to score enough. 
And that’s what’s happening to 
these teams. They’re just not 
scoring enough.”
Teske has been a key to 
Michigan’s defensive efforts all 
season. He’s made the most of his 
size, and has played a big role as 
a shot-blocker inside. When the 
Wolverines’ defense is performing 
well, Teske is usually at the heart 
of that.
His performance is often at 
the center of the offense, too, 
whether it be in setting screens 
for Michigan’s guards or posting 
up. Teske’s early-season scoring 
run coincided with the stretch 
over which Michigan went on an 
8-1 tear and skyrocketed to No. 
4 in the Associated Press poll. 
His quieter streak on offense fell 
mainly over the period that saw 
Michigan bleeding conference 
games left and right.
Lately, the Wolverines have 
gotten hot again – something 
Teske largely has not been a part 
of, as his slump on offense has 
continued. 

But that may be changing. 
Saturday’s performance was 
much closer to the Teske of the 
early season. With upcoming 
games against Wisconsin, Ohio 
State and Maryland — all of whom 
have strong interiors anchored by 
even stronger big men — Michigan 
needs that Teske back, on both 
sides of the ball. 
“We have to protect the paint,” 
Howard said Saturday. “We can’t 
allow a drive to a dump-off and 
that ends up being a score in the 
paint. It’s something we have 
stressed, that we have to do a 
better job of protecting the paint. 
… So it’s important for me to get 
our guys more organized.”
Under Howard’s direction, rim 
protection has been a major focus 
for this team throughout the 
course of the season, and Teske 
has been a major part of that. 
Early on, Howard often left Teske 
alone in the post and relied almost 
entirely on him to shut down 
scoring inside. Lately, Teske’s been 
getting some help in the post from 
guards, and it’s proven successful. 
Michigan’s post defense has been 
much improved lately, no longer 
a doormat for the various Big Ten 
big men it faces.
But interior offense has been a 
major factor in Michigan’s success 
for a lot of the year as well. Much 
of that, too, is due to Teske. It’s 
part of what has made the highs 
so high and the lows so low. 
March, and the organized chaos 
that it brings to college basketball, 
is just six days away. If the 
Wolverines want to really make a 
run at it, they’re going to need to 
be able to win in multiple ways. 
Perimeter scoring seems just fine. 
Points in the paint, though, are 
still something of a question. And 
as much as senior center Austin 
Davis and sophomore forward 
Colin 
Castleton 
have 
been 
helping, Teske, the senior captain, 
still plays the most minutes of any 
of Michigan’s big men. When he’s 
at his best, he is the team’s anchor. 
The Wolverines are about 
to have to navigate their way 
through the craziness of March. 
It’s clear that the path of least 
resistance is the one in which 
Teske adds another dimension. 
They just have to hope he 
shows up.

Against Purdue, ‘M’ shows its depth

WEST LAFAYETTE — Over 
the course of their latest five-
game 
winning 
streak, 
the 
Wolverines 
have 
showcased 
their depth. 
The usual suspects of Zavier 
Simpson, Isaiah Livers and 
Eli Brooks have all had their 
moments — Simpson’s four 
3-pointers against Michigan 
State, Livers’ 17-point outing 
against 
Northwestern 
and 
Brooks’ 
three 
double-digit 
scoring efforts. 
When they haven’t though, 
Michigan’s been able to fall 
back on the rest of its roster. 
Whether it was sophomores 
David 
DeJulius 
and 
Colin 
Castleton chipping in for a 
absent Livers last Wednesday 
against 
Rutgers, 
sophomore 
forward 
Brandon 
Johns 
Jr.’s scoring 14 points in the 
team’s win against Indiana 
or senior center Austin Davis 
registering valuable minutes in 
relief of starter Jon Teske, the 
Wolverines’ most recent wins 
have been a collective effort.
Saturday 
afternoon 
was 
no different. Off the back of 
team-high 
22 
points 
from 
freshman 
forward 
Franz 
Wagner, Michigan pushed its 
current win streak to five — and 
seven of the last eight — with 
a comfortable, 71-63 win over 
Purdue. 
“The shot was falling finally,” 
Wagner said. “I’m working hard 
in practice. I’m taking shots 
I’m comfortable taking and I’m 
taking them with confidence. 
That’s what the staff wants me 
to do. I think it’s important to 
keep doing that no matter of the 
percentage.”
Livers added: “I’m super 
proud of him. To come in as 
a freshman and play 30-plus 
(minutes) 
— 
not 
a 
lot 
of 
experienced guys played that 
much last year. You don’t even 
think he’s an underclassman 
when he plays out there because 
he plays with so much emotion.” 
Wagner’s 
9-for-13, 
five-rebound, 
two-steal 
performance 
came 
with 
Simpson going scoreless from 

the field, Brooks registering just 
four points in 21 minutes and 
relatively quiet afternoons from 
Johns Jr. and Davis. Instead, 
it was Wagner and Livers who 
shouldered the scoring burden, 
with the junior returning to 
action with 19 points. 
On any given night is a phrase 
thrown around too frequently, 
but it’s certainly applied to 
the Wolverines recently — any 
player, on any given night can 
be the difference offensively.
“We have five guys averaging 
double 
figures,” 
Michigan 
associate 
head 
coach 
Phil 
Martelli said. “It’s tremendous 
balance.”
According to Martelli, that 
balanced offensive production 
took root over the summer as 
Michigan coach Juwan Howard 
implemented 
his 
scheme. 
After a difficult January, the 
Wolverines are finally clicking 
with the same effectiveness 
they showed to start the season.
“The 
first 
statement 
to 
them in July was that under 
this system they were going 
to learn to share the game,” 
Martelli said. “That’s what we 
do. We share the game. When 
we got in trouble, going back to 
the slump, the ball was being 

dribbled too much and there 
wasn’t enough trust. This team 
now has complete trust.
“These guys in practice are 
held accountable. I think that 
carries over. We can walk out of 
here tonight and say ‘Hey, that 
wasn’t Austin.’ Think about 
that, we have expectations 
for Austin Davis that yeah, he 
met it physically but not with 
buckets and things like that.”
Winning by committee is 
perfectly 
fine 
in 
Howard’s 
estimation. While he would 
prefer to see his players produce 
as consistently as possible, if 
Simpson leads the way one 
night and Wagner does another, 
Howard is indifferent. The win 
column is the only statistic that 
matters. 
“Yes, our guys have the 
mindset that numbers don’t 
matter,” Howard said. “The 
only 
number 
that 
matters 
is winning. If we score one 
point more than our opponent, 
personal stats and all that stuff 
— that’s for social media likes 
and stuff like that.”
On Saturday, just like the 
past two weeks, Michigan’s 
depth was put on full display 
and it once again yielded that 
sought-after win.

February 24, 2020 — 3B

EAST LANSING — Three 
minutes and 32 seconds remained 
when junior forward Hailey 
Brown had just committed an 
offensive foul — her fifth, ending 
her night. 
A minute passed, and senior 
guard 
Akienreh 
Johnson 
committed her fifth. She shook 
her head as she walked off, 
knowing she’d have to watch 
her teammates try to hold onto 
a five-point lead that had once 
been as high as 18. The Breslin 
Center pulsed. 
On 
the 
ensuing 
inbound, 
Michigan 
State 
guard 
Tory 
Ozment lost the ball. On the 
other end, her fellow guard 
Taryn 
McCutcheon 
fouled 
Michigan guard Amy Dilk. 
Dilk made both free throws. 
In the few minutes of basketball 
that remained, she made six 
more, helping the Wolverines 
escape East Lansing with a 65-57 
victory over the Spartans.
“(My) mentality going in there 
is once I made both two, I got the 
feel for it, I got the confidence, 
and I wanted them to foul me,” 
Dilk said. “I wanted to step up 
and I wanted to make those 
shots.”
Early on, both teams came out 
sluggish offensively, combining 
for five missed field goals and 
three turnovers in a scoreless 
first three minutes. Naturally, 
it was sophomore guard Naz 
Hillmon who ended the drought 
for Michigan, drawing a foul in 
the post and sinking one of two 
free throws. 
From there, the floodgates 
opened for Hillmon. Michigan 
State’s defense had no answer 
for her, as she continued to 
dominate in the paint en route 
to a 17-point first half on 7-for-9 
shooting. 
“There’s not really kids in 
the country that can play with 
that kind of motor and that kind 

of enthusiasm and that kind 
of toughness,” Michigan State 
coach Suzy Merchant said. “I 
just have always been respectful 
of what she has been able to do. 
For us to give her 17 points in the 
first half, that was just absolutely 
ridiculous. Unacceptable on our 
part, on all of our part. We just 
did a bad job.”
Strong 
play 
from 
the 
Wolverines’ bigs allowed them 
to extend the lead in the second 
quarter. After Brown committed 
her second foul and checked out 
with seven minutes remaining, 
freshman center Izabel Varejão 
picked up two offensive rebounds 
and five points, helping to extend 
Michigan’s lead to 15 at halftime.
But in the third quarter, the 
Wolverines’ offense stagnated. 
While bad passes, travels and 
offensive fouls led to only one 
Michigan field goal the entire 
third quarter, Michigan State 
found its own rhythm on the 
other end, largely due to the 
Wolverines’ 
10 
third-quarter 
fouls. 
Though the Spartans shot 
just 5-for-9 from the free throw 
line in the third quarter, Brown, 
Varejão and Johnson all had to sit 
with foul trouble for an extended 
period. This opened up the floor 
for Michigan State’s scorers and 
extended Michigan’s offensive 
woes into the fourth, where the 
Wolverines missed every field 
goal attempt in the first three 
minutes. The Spartans took full 
advantage, gaining the lead on a 
layup from guard Nia Clouden.
But 
after 
that 
make, 
Michigan 
finally 
woke 
up. 
About a minute later, Hillmon 
converted a three-point play 
— the Wolverines’ first real 
offense in the second half. From 
there, they locked down on the 
defensive end, allowing just two 
field goals the rest of the game 
and providing the much-needed 
spark to sustain their lead. 
“That 
run 
there 
was 
something 
that 
we 
weren’t 

looking forward to,” Hillmon 
said. “But I think it was our 
defense that really fueled us and 
we wanted to say just, ‘Stop after 
stop. Let’s get a stop and then we 
can figure out our offense.’ ”
For a team still fighting for 
an 
NCAA 
Tournament 
bid, 
any win — especially on the 
road in the Big Ten — is worth 
celebrating. But that narrative 
took a backseat on Sunday, 
where Michigan completed its 
first season sweep of Michigan 
State since 2015. 
“Obviously, being from the 
East coast and the Big Eas,t I 
always followed Michigan State 
because they had such rich 
tradition and had been such 
a great program,” Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico said. “I 
knew that that was going to be 
a measuring stick when I first 
got to Michigan and that’s kind 
of been my goal, our team’s goal, 
since I’ve been here.
“... This is tremendous for our 
university, and it’s tremendous 
for our players.”

EAST LANSING — Amy 
Dilk, while sinking another 
free throw, looked over to the 
bench and smirked. It was her 
game, her court, her win.
The sophomore guard scored 
nine of the last 10 points for the 
Michigan women’s basketball 
team, all from the charity 
stripe, on her way to lead the 
Wolverines to a 65-57 victory 
over Michigan State.
“I’ve been struggling from 
the line this year in the Big 
Ten conference,” Dilk said. 
“They probably wanted to foul 
me, and at that point, I wanted 
them to foul me. So seeing the 
ball go in twice about two or 
three times in a row as a player 
just feels good, knowing that 
you’ve kind of gotten over that 
slump.”
The beginning of the game 
told a much different story, 
though.
Just 
two 
minutes 
in, 

Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico stood, speechless — her 
mouth agape, arms to the side. 
She had just spoken with Dilk 
to try and jumpstart her after 
a dismal first three minutes 
that saw two turnovers and no 
points.
And there, directly in front 
of Barnes Arico, Dilk turned 
the ball over in the backcourt, 
giving the Spartans two easy 
points.
Barnes 
Arico, 
normally 
animated 
on 
the 
sideline, 
barely moved as she watched 
the guard move up the court 
a second time. The rest of the 
quarter crept by, with neither 
team 
finding 
its 
footing 
offensively, and every time a 
Michigan player went to the 
foul line, Barnes Arico waved 
Dilk 
and 
freshman 
guard 
Maddie Nolan over.
“I think it’s just a little bit 
of jitters, and once we got that 
first bucket in, it was fine,” 
Dilk said. “(Barnes Arico) was 
just talking to me about what 

she sees out there to relate 
to my team, whether that’s 
(sophomore 
forward 
Naz 
Hillmon) slipping. The biggest 
thing was the two-man game. 
They couldn’t guard it in the 
first half, and that’s what we 
kept going back to.”
In the second quarter, Dilk 
finally dissected the defense, 
and 
along 
with 
Hillmon, 
spurred 
on 
the 
Wolverine 
offense to an explosive second 
quarter. Finishing the first 
half, Dilk was halfway to a 
triple-double — tallying five 
points, five rebounds and five 
assists.
But when the second half 
started, the offensive troubles 
returned and none of the 
Michigan players managed to 
find success, with Dilk turning 
the ball over four times and 
getting into foul trouble. Even 
when she got to the line, she 
would always go 1-for-2, a 
perpetual 50-percent shooter.
So as the time wound down, 
the Spartans focused their 
efforts on fouling Dilk.
“That’s a lot of growth, in 
a period of three quarters to 
the fourth quarter,” Hillmon 
said. “I think she knew what 
she needed to do. She really 
locked in on that. Her being 
our primary ballhandler, she 
knew that she had to get us into 
something. … She knew it was 
crunch time, and she flipped 
the switch.”
Outside of Dilk’s fourth-
quarter 
numbers, 
Michigan 
shot an abysmal 55 percent 
from the free throw line. Dilk — 
all the momentum on Michigan 
State’s side, the crowd smelling 
a 
collapse, 
the 
Wolverines 
fearing one — shot 9-for-10.
Despite 
earlier 
struggles, 
despite 
a 
stop-and-go 
game with 54 fouls, despite 
teammates fouling out, it was 
Amy Dilk’s game.
In the last five minutes, Dilk 
had ice in her veins.

Sweeping State

Michigan beats Michigan State, 65-57, in East Lansing to secure season sweep of Spartans

‘M’ suffers first losses of season 

Michigan 
softball’s 
perfect 
record is gone.
Offensive 
inconsistency 
plagued 
the 
Wolverines 
all 
weekend 
at 
the 
Gamecock 
Invitational resulting in Michigan 
dropping three of four games. In 
the first game of the series, against 
Liberty, the Wolverines’ snuck by 
with a 1-0 win.
Sophomore right-hander Alex 
Storako and junior left-hander 
Meghan 
Beaubien 
tag-teamed 
it for the win. Storako had 13 
strikeouts against the Flames — 
her third game of the season with 
double-digit strikeouts. Beaubien 
came in to close in the top of the 
sixth inning, and finished the 
game with the final four outs.
On Saturday, Michigan’s perfect 
record came to a screeching halt 
against Iowa State, losing 5-1. 
On both sides of the plate, the 
Wolverines couldn’t execute. With 
just seven team hits equating to 
only one run, Michigan left eight 
runners on base. 
“We’re trying to find something 
to spark our offense,” Michigan 
coach Carol Hutchins said.
Pitching-wise, the Wolverines 
also struggled, having to throw 
all three of their pitchers against 
the Cyclones. In her first relief 
opportunity, 
freshman 
right-

hander Chandler Dennis finished 
out the game with one strikeout. 
Beaubien was credited with the 
loss.
The Wolverines were again 
unable to capitalize on their 
offense against South Carolina. 
Michigan lost, 3-0 — the first time 
they haven’t scored in a game all 
season. Multiple lineup shifts 
occurred throughout the game. 
Senior infielder Madison Uden and 
freshman utility player Lauren 
Esman were given pinch-hitting 
opportunities, but ultimately, the 
Wolverines 
couldn’t 
overcome 
their offensive struggles. There 
were just two hits, but with five 
runners left on base, Michigan 
relinquished many opportunities 
to score.
“When the offense isn’t clicking, 
it’s pretty difficult to know who to 
put where,” Hutchins said. “And 
eventually, and we saw this last 
year, we will settle in and I look 
forward to that.”
Rounding out the weekend, 
on Sunday, the Wolverines faced 
Liberty again. After their 1-0 win, 
Michigan came out hot against 
the Flames. Scoring twice in 
the first inning, the Wolverines 
started almost the same way as 
Friday’s game against Liberty. The 
Wolverines looked like they came 
ready to play. 
In 
the 
second 
inning, 
sophomore 
catcher 
Hannah 

Carson homered to right-center. 
With a 5-1 score, it seemed like 
Michigan would end the weekend 
with a win. But, that reality 
slipped away.
In a relief effort, Storako 
entered the game in the middle 
of the bottom of the sixth. Facing 
her first batter, Liberty infielder 
Autumn Bishop hit a home run, 
and with two runners on base, the 
Wolverines’ four-run lead was cut 
to 5-4. 
The wheels finally came off in 
the last inning when a single to 
right tied the game for the Flames. 
The final nail in the coffin came in 
the bottom of the seventh, when 
Bishop hit a walk-off homer to end 
the game, 6-5.
Going 
into 
the 
weekend 
Michigan was 9-0, and No. 8 in 
the country. Coming out of the 
weekend the Wolverines are 10-3, 
with their future ranking up in 
the air after losses to unranked 
Liberty and Iowa State, and 
then-No. 22 South Carolina. Still, 
Michigan is unconcerned.
“We have a lot of trust in each 
other,” Jimenez said. “We have 
full faith that we can bounce back 
from this and it’s only a matter of 
one-pitch softball. So just taking 
the game one pitch at a time and 
we come back as a team together 
and we focus on what we have 
to get done and I feel that we’re 
gonna get that done.”

Wolverines drop series to UConn, 2-1

It was a weekend of a few highs 
and many lows for the Michigan 
baseball team.
There was disappointment on 
Friday in Port St. Lucie, Fla., as 
the Wolverines’ (4-3) early 6-0 
lead over UConn (3-3) crumbled 
away over the last four innings 
into an 8-7 loss. 
There 
was 
jubilation 
on 
Saturday, when freshman third 
baseman Ted Burton hit his first 
career home run to drive in three. 
The shot brought Michigan’s 
lead to 13-2 and helped facilitate 
an explosive 14-2 win.
On 
Sunday, 
frustration 
returned, as the Wolverines 
fell behind early and never 
recovered, falling, 9-2, to the 
Huskies. 
Michigan’s 
mindset 
going 
into its weekend series was 
already affected by its 7-1 loss 
to UConn last week during the 
MLB4 Collegiate Tournament 
in Scottsdale, Ariz. After this 
weekend, it’s clear the Huskies 
have been effective in tempering 
the Wolverines’ momentum after 
three high-caliber wins against 
Vanderbilt, Cal Poly and Arizona 
State.
Michigan came fast out of the 
gate in Friday’s game with five 
runs in the first inning, sending 
UConn’s starter Will Lucas out 
of the game early. Strangely 
enough, the five runs came off 
only one hit due to a string of 
walks, a sac fly and a UConn 
error.
After junior Jordan Nwogu’s 
first home run of the season 
brought Michigan’s lead to 6-2 
in the second inning, it seemed 
like the Wolverines would find 
redemption after last Sunday’s 
loss. But the Huskies’ four runs 
in the top of the sixth –– two 
off 
junior 
right-hander 
Jeff 
Criswell and two off freshman 
right-hander Cameron Weston 
–– began to turn the tide. 
“Normally when you knock 
a starter out after two-thirds 
of an inning and put a five-spot 
up in the first inning, that’s a 
pretty good recipe for winning 
the game,” Michigan coach Erik 
Bakich said. “The big four-spot 

in the sixth inning was when 
they got all the momentum back 
… so, they kind of blew it in the 
first inning, and we blew it in the 
sixth.”
Friday’s result was still of 
relatively 
little 
concern 
for 
Bakich.
“I think that was a game that 
would’ve 
continued 
to 
have 
multiple lead changes the way it 
was going,” he added. “They just 
happened to be the ones with the 
one-run lead after the ninth.”
Saturday was a different story. 
A similar 6-2 lead by the end of 
the second inning held this time 
around and was compounded by 
seven-run fourth inning, which 
included 
Burton’s 
inaugural 
home run, bringing the score to 
13-2. 
Redshirt 
freshman 
Steven 
Hajjar started and secured the 
win in his five innings of pitching. 
Freshman 
left-hander 
Jacob 
Denner, 
meanwhile, 
attained 
his first career save after four 
scoreless innings, maintaining 
the Wolverines’ 14-2 lead. 
“I’m glad we showed what 
we could do on Day 2,” Denner 
said. “I was glad because it’s 
definitely different transitioning 
from high school. … I’ve been 
hanging around (redshirt senior) 
Ben Keizer, Jeff Criswell and 
(redshirt 
sophomore) 
Isaiah 
Page a lot, and they’ve done a 
great job in getting me ready for 
these moments.”
Sunday’s rubber match looked 
more like Michigan’s 7-1 loss 
back in Scottsdale, though. After 
a slow start of three scoreless 
innings for both teams, UConn 
rallied at two outs in the fifth 

inning to extend its 2-0 lead into 
an insurmountable 8-0 edge. 
Save for one run in the 
bottom 
of 
the 
sixth, 
the 
Wolverines stalled until the 
ninth inning which started off 
with a promising four at-bats. 
Sophomore infielder Cam Hart 
managed to reach home off a 
single from Nwogu. With the 
bases loaded and still no outs, 
there was a glimmer of hope 
that the Huskies’ lead could 
shrink. But three strikeouts in 
a row quickly extinguished that 
chance to end the game and 
the Wolverines’ roller coaster 
weekend. 
“The way we competed in 
those first four at-bats in the 
ninth –– if we had done it every 
at-bat of the weekend, we’d have 
had a different result,” Bakich 
said.
Despite 
their 
offensive 
dominance on Saturday, the 
team’s woes ultimately seemed 
to lie with an inability to respond 
with runs. In both the first and 
third games, one or two breakout 
innings from UConn thwarted 
Michigan’s offensive momentum. 
“I’m disappointed that our 
at-bats weren’t as competitive as 
they could’ve been in the first and 
third game,” Bakich said. “We 
need to do a better job hitting 
good pitches with less than two 
strikes and battling with two 
strikes to string quality at-bats 
together. … The lack of success 
this weekend is us pointing the 
thumb at some of our lack of 
execution, and that’s really it.
“We’ve got a clear plan for the 
week ahead of what we need to 
get better at.”

NOTRE DAME SNAPS MICHIGAN’S WIN STREAK, 
SWEEPING WOLVERINES AT YOST IN CRUSHING 
BLOW TO AT-LARGE NCAA TOURNAMENT HOPES

ALEC COHEN / Daily

OUT OF LUCK

Michigan falls, 3-0, on Senior Day

Two-and-a-half 
periods 
of 
grinding hockey were over, and 
yet the game remained scoreless. 
But 
then 
Notre 
Dame 
defenseman 
Spencer 
Stastney 
skated across the slot and fired 
a shot from the left side at 
sophomore 
goaltender 
Strauss 
Mann. 
The puck ricocheted off a post 
and play continued. Sophomore 
forward Nolan Moyle immediately 
got a breakaway the other way, but 
couldn’t convert. Play stopped 
to review the events that had 
unfolded. The key question — 
what post did Stastney’s shot hit?
Video replay soon made it clear 
that the puck had hit the post all 
the way at the back of the net. And 
just like that, the Michigan hockey 
team (15-14-3 overall, 10-10-2-1 
Big Ten) trailed by one against 
Notre Dame (14-12-6, 9-8-5-3) on 
Saturday’s Senior Day at Yost Ice 
Arena.
To 
Michigan 
coach 
Mel 
Pearson and the rest of the guys 
on the bench, it was clear the shot 
went in when they saw it live. For 
sophomore forward Garrett Van 
Wyhe, who was on the ice at the 
time, it was less certain.
“To be honest, I didn’t think 
(the puck went in),” Van Wyhe 
said of his initial thoughts. “But I 
was right there and I had to turn 
around a little bit, so I wasn’t sure. 
I just played to the whistle.”
That goal seemed to take some 
energy out of the Wolverines. A 
couple minutes later, forward 
Cam Morrison attacked Mann 
from the left side and snuck the 
puck by him to put the game away 
for good.
Michigan tried to fight back by 
pulling Mann in the final minutes, 
but the efforts fell short. The 
Fighting Irish notched an empty-
net goal, and thus the Wolverines 
fell, 3-0. The loss marked the 
second in a row and a change in 
momentum after what has been a 

surging second-half performance.
“When you don’t score, you’re 
not gonna win, and we just 
couldn’t make enough plays. Give 
them credit,” Pearson said. “They 
came and played like a desperate 
team, like their season was on the 
line, and that’s how they played.”
Within the first 30 seconds 
of the game, Michigan’s penalty 
kill unit went into action, as 
senior defenseman Luke Martin 
got called for slashing. The 
Wolverines did a good job clearing 
the puck and successfully killed 
the penalty. The unit had a strong 
night, killing all four penalties.
The Fighting Irish had their 
best chance of the period within 
the first few minutes. Forward 
Jake Pivonka corralled a stray 
puck in the neutral zone and 
immediately 
went 
one-on-one 
against Mann. The ensuing shot 
sailed wide left, though.
That was one of the few scoring 
chances for either side in the 
opening frame. Halfway through 
the period, Michigan still had yet 
to register a shot on goal, while 
Notre Dame had done so just 
twice. The Wolverines’ first shot 
on net came from sophomore 
defenseman Nick Blankenburg 
from the high slot, but goaltender 
Cale Morris handled it with ease.
The two sides went back 
and forth with penalties in the 
latter part of the opening frame. 
Defenseman 
Matt 
Hellickson 
cross-checked 
senior 
forward 
Will Lockwood with nine minutes 
to go. Right after the Fighting Irish 
killed their penalty, sophomore 
forward Jimmy Lambert headed 
to the box for tripping. That 
penalty, too, was scoreless.
And then in the final minutes 
of the first frame, Michigan went 
on the power play again. But it was 
the same story.
Right 
after 
the 
first 
intermission, 
senior 
forward 
Jacob Hayhurst nearly got the 
Wolverines on the board first. 
He attacked the crease from the 
left side and started to pull the 

puck across his body. But Morris 
somehow used his blocker to strip 
the puck from Hayhurst’s stick 
and keep the game scoreless.
Midway through the second 
period, Lambert skated off the ice 
and never returned. It was unclear 
what happened, but his future this 
season looks bleak.
“He’s probably out for the 
year,” Pearson said. “We’ll look 
at — I think he got X-rays. I think 
it’s broken, so I don’t expect 
him back the rest of the year. I 
was just talking a couple weeks 
ago about how we’re healthy 
and feeling good, then he goes 
down. (Freshman forward Eric) 
Ciccolini had shoulder surgery 
and it’s hard. It’s tough. But we 
have to carry on. Nobody’s gonna 
feel sorry for us.”
And then with around eight 
minutes to go, Lockwood fell to 
the ground after blocking a shot 
with his left leg. He was slow to 
get up and over to the bench. He 
returned soon after, but couldn’t 
play as much in crunch time.
“It’s tough, my knee I think 
is just bruised,” Lockwood said. 
“I kept going out there, trying to 
put weight on it, but I couldn’t go 
out there and it’s tough watching 
from the bench, I’ve been in that 
position before, and it’s hard, 
especially when your team’s losing 
like that, so it’s not too easy.”
A scrum broke out near the 
Wolverines’ net in the second 
frame. Van Wyhe and forward 
Mike O’Leary both got tossed in 
the box for coincidental roughing 
penalties. That confrontation was 
emblematic of the game — it was 
a battle, with both sides searching 
desperately for a leg up.
Eventually, 
though, 
Notre 
Dame 
found 
it 
— 
stealing 
Michigan’s spotlight on Senior 
Day.
“We’ll learn from it,” Pearson 
said. “We’ll go forward. Now we 
just have to take it game-to-game. 
Literally. Because we’re getting to 
that point now where that’s how 
it’s gonna be.”

The assumption of a defensive game

None of the Michigan hockey 
players said it. Mel Pearson 
didn’t either.
But they didn’t have to.
Even if no one said it aloud, it 
was easy to see why, in a hard-
nosed, gritty defensive battle, 
that the one to come out would 
be the one to strike first. 
For all of Saturday’s game, 
Michigan and Notre Dame had 
struggled to score.
Both teams went two full 
periods unable to produce a 
single goal. The scarcity of 
goals wasn’t the fault of poor 
offense, but rather exceptional 
defense. Both sides have stout 
goaltending. They play the 
passing lanes. They pack the 
crease. And they recognized 
that the highly-coveted first 
goal would be the deciding 
factor.
“You just don’t want to play 
from 
behind,” 
sophomore 
forward Garrett Van Wyhe said. 
“Get that first one and then we 
can kind of dictate how the rest 
of the game goes. 
“If we get that first one, that 
means that we’re hard on the 
forecheck and we are playing 
our systems. If you get that 
first one, then they’re kind of 
scrambling and maybe we can 
get the second one quick. But 
the first goal is huge.”
And the Wolverines failed to 
obtain it — leading to a 3-0 loss.
Going 
into 
Saturday, 
Michigan knew what mindset 
it needed to have. Just the day 
before, the Irish had given them 
another two scoreless periods 
to start the game. Just the day 
before, the Irish had broken 
the ice late to snowball goals in 
rapid succession, dominating 
the low-scoring affair.
The point was hammered 
home; the first team to score 
was the one to win.
“When you give up a goal 

— whichever team is gonna 
score, they’re gonna get the 
momentum,” Michigan coach 
Mel Pearson said. “That just 
shifted like that. We just didn’t 
have enough pushback in the 
third period. We were tired. We 
were exhausted both mentally 
and physically, at that point.”
That’s the nature of a scrappy 
game. Goals give energy; they 
spark 
positivity. 
They 
give 
affirmation that all the banging 
and physical play was worth it. 
And when the stalemate lasts 
all game, the suspense of the 
first goal builds. If it hasn’t 
come after two hard period’s 
worth of work, what says it 
comes at all?
But 
it 
did 
come 
— 
for 
Notre 
Dame. 
The 
Irish 
struck in the 
middle of the 
third 
period 
after 
Spencer 
Stastney 
held 
the puck and 
waited for his 
shot, 
curling 
through 
the 
slot. He slung it on net and it 
rang on the back pipe, quickly 
bouncing in and out. If you 
blinked, you would have missed 
it.
In fact, Van Wyhe didn’t 
even think it went in. But when 
the play was under review, it 
became clear to everyone upon 
the first replay. It was a goal. 
And the dejection came shortly 
after.
“You just see it. You sag, and 
then you start thinking about 
last night’s game,” Pearson 
said. “We were exhausted. We 
pushed hard. You need that 
fire, that spark, and when you 
go pretty much six periods 
without scoring — last night 
was an extra attacker goal. 
It starts to wear on you both 
mentally and physically. More 
mentally.”

The mental wear led to the 
collapse. After the first goal 
was 
scored, 
Notre 
Dame’s 
second followed less than two 
minutes after.
Michigan began to panic, 
forcing offense and jeopardizing 
defense in a desperate attempt 
to tie the game.
“(The Irish) just play a certain 
way,” Pearson said. “They wait 
for their opportunities and 
they take advantage of their 
opportunities.”
And at the start of the game, 
the Wolverines did, too. But 
after the late goal was scored, 
their patience was running thin. 
They jumped on high pucks; 
they tried to pushed behind 
the 
net. 
They 
were playing out 
of their normal 
defensive system 
and 
chasing 
offense 
where 
there was none.
“They’re 
trying to do too 
much instead of 
just, 
‘Hold 
on, 
keep back, wait 
until we get some 
better opportunities,” Pearson 
said. “We just tried to push 
forward too hard”
It was the mental strain of 
being unable to produce.
“I think we just get in our 
head a little bit,” Van Wyhe 
said.
Added Lockwood: “When we 
swept them, I think we scored 
both goals first. If we would 
have gotten that first one, it 
could have been a different 
story both nights.”
At that point, it was wishful 
thinking. If they had gotten 
that first goal, things could 
have been different. If they 
had gotten that first goal, they 
could have controlled the game. 
If they had gotten that first goal, 
they could have won.
And those were words they 
didn’t have to say aloud.

Get that first 
one and then 
we can kind of 
dictate.
