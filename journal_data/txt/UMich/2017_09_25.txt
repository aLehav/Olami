Approximately 
400 
Ann 

Arbor community members 
embarked 
in 
unseasonably 

warm 
temperatures 
to 

raise awareness for suicide 
education 
and 
prevention 

by participating in the Out 
of the Darkness community 
walkSaturday morning in West 
Park.

Out 
of 
the 
Darkness 

community walks took place 
nationwide this weekend with 
the aim of raising awareness 
about suicide prevention as 
well as funds for the American 
Foundation 
for 
Suicide 

Prevention 
to 
implement 

education 
and 
awareness 

strategies.

The Ann Arbor walk was 

one of more than ten Out of the 
Darkness walks that took place 
in the state of Michigan over 
the weekend. According to 
Patricia Wheeler, chair of the 
walk and board member for 
the AFSP southeast Michigan 
chapter, this year’s Ann Arbor 
walk reported record breaking 
funds 
— 
surpassing 
their 

original goal of $30,000 dollars 
by raising over $50,000.

“For this walk, today we 

have 
raised 
more 
money 

than any walk in Ann Arbor,” 
Wheeler said. 

The money raised came 

from donations from local 
organizations 
as 
well 
as 

funds raised by participating 

teams and individuals. All the 
funds raised are used to raise 
awareness about suicide and to 
develop methods of education 
directed 
toward 
suicide 

prevention.

“Fifty 
percent 
of 
the 

funds raised today stay in 
the southeast Michigan area 
to help with local education 
and 
prevention 
measures,” 

Wheeler 
said. 
“The 
other 

half goes to the national 

organization, 
which 
is 

collectively the largest funder 
of suicide research.”

Most participants were Ann 

Arbor community members 
including Ann Arbor residents, 
high school and University 
students, all of which were 
present to support the AFSP’s 
efforts to raise awareness.

LSA senior Taylor Rovin 

joined the walk to show her 
support for suicide prevention 

and participated on behalf 
of her feminist sorority, Zeta 
Omega Eta, which included the 
walk as part of their rush week 
events.

“All of the rush events for 

my sorority are optional but 
I thought this one was really 
cool and an important event to 
be a part of,” Rovin said.

On mornings with home football 

games, collegiate men and women 
across campus rifle through piles 
of maize and blue clothing in an 
attempt to put together the perfect 
game day outfit.

A game day outfit could be 

the most important form of garb 
University of Michigan students 
wear throughout their time at the 
University. Captured by Snapchat, 
Instagram, Facebook and the 
like, what one wears on Saturday 
football lives on eternally in the 
realm of social media. Now, this 
demand for Michigan spirit wear 
could soon be leading to changes 
with local retailers. 

The Michigan Daily conducted 

a campus survey on student spirit 
wear choices to 500 randomly 
selected students, of which 56 
students responded.

Based on the survey results, 

56.14 
percent 
of 
respondents 

suggested their primary source 
of tailgating clothing was campus 
retailers, such as the M Den or Moe 
Sport Shops.

clothing store on State Street,

The Leadership Engagement 

Scholarship, approved in January 
by Central Student Government 
and designed to provide assistance 
to students who wish to become 
more involved on campus but may 
not have the financial means to 
do so, continues in its fundraising 
process despite no longer being a 
CSG initiative. The fundraising is 
led by LSA senior Micah Griggs, 
former CSG vice president, and 
Business junior Arathi Sabada, 
former 
CSG 
chief 
operating 

officer.

At the beginning of their terms as 

CSG President and Vice President 
in 2016, David Schafer and Griggs, 
respectively, 
administered 
a 

demographic report to members 
of CSG, and found the results to 
be economically homogenous— 75 
percent of the student governing 
body comes from homes earning 
over $100,000 a year. This report 
was one of several that made the 
CSG administration aware of 
how the University, specifically 
regarding students in leadership 
positions, lacks financial diversity.

Recreational 
marijuana 

is now closer than ever to 
becoming 
permitted 
by 
law 

in Michigan. A ballot petition 
being circulated by the Coalition 
to 
Regulate 
Marijuana 
Like 

Alcohol is “well past” 250,000 
signatures, 
according 
to 
the 

group’s spokesman Josh Hovey. 
The state of Michigan requires 
252,523 valid signatures for the 
initiative to make it onto the ballot 
in November 2018.

Hovey says the group’s goal is to 

collect 350,000 signatures, to give 
themselves a cushion for invalid 
signatures — signatures that 
cannot be traced to a registered 
voter or signatures from a voter 
who has already signed — and 

they aim to have everything 
submitted to the state by Nov. 22.

If they are able to reach their 

goal, and the state validates at least 
252,523 signatures, the initiative 
will then go to the legislature 
for a vote. If the bill fails in the 
legislature, it will then go on the 
ballot in Nov. 2018 for residents of 
Michigan to vote.

Though he isn’t sure how it 

will fare in the legislature, state 
Rep. Yousef Rabhi, D-Ann Arbor, 
is optimistic about the proposal’s 
chances if it goes to the ballot in 
2018.

“I support the bill,” Rabhi said. 

“In terms of whether or not it is 
viable, I think that you are seeing 
unprecedented support, frankly, 
for this bill statewide. I think that 
the petition drive is going really 
well. I think that people are ready

LSA sophomore Kori Thomas 

was confronted with two unpleasant 
surprises one Friday morning in 
October of her freshman year.

The first was a collection of 

racially charged flyers she found 

posted outside her dorm, with 
subjects like “Black and White IQ 
Distributions” and “Lifetime Risk of 
HIV Diagnosis by Race/Ethnicity.”

The second was the flood of 

aggressive and threatening replies 
she received after tweeting pictures 
of the posters.

“You cant escape the meme 

magic. It wont stop until every 

white man and woman is woken up. 
#MAGA #AltRight,” another tweet 
read.

Thomas was not expecting the 

high volume of replies, she said. 
There were 192 in total — some 
supporting her, but most reinforcing 
the message on the posters. In 
retrospect, she said, she might not 
have tweeted those pictures if she 

had known the reactions she would 
receive.

“I thought it might be a couple 

people, but it was so much, so I just 
kind of blocked it out,” Thomas said. 
“After that happened I just didn’t 
know how to deal with it. So if there 
was a better way not involving that 
(tweeting the pictures), I would

Local organization discusses how to 
fight gentrification at Diag session

Event first of two information sessions which will take place in Ann Arbor and Ypsi

JENNIFER MEER
Daily Staff Reporter

Revolutionary Youth Alliance, 

A2/Ypsi, 
a 
locally-based 

organization aiming to fight 
against 
imperialism, 
racism, 

misogyny and other forms of 
oppression, held an informational 
meeting about the effects of 
gentrification and counter efforts 
Sunday afternoon in the Diag.

LSA sophomore Jeff Smith, one 

of the leaders of the presentation, 
explained gentrification refers to 
the process by which less wealthy 
people are displaced from their 
neighborhoods 
by 
wealthier 

people.

“People 
start 
moving 
in, 

individuals start moving in, 
unsupported by any government 
… After that, wealthy individuals, 
real 
estate 
developers 
take 

notice of the waves of people 
coming in and they begin to buy 
up property and open more and 
more 
expensive 
businesses,” 

Smith said. “Young people are 
flocking in. New restaurants are 
opening, along with coffee shops, 
bike stores, and places where 
juice costs seven dollars per 
bottle.”

He said the influx of such 

businesses may seem like a 
“cultural 
revival,” 
but 
the 

reality is that businesses and 
landowners are simply making 
more profit — something that 
can be observed in Detroit and 
Ypsilanti, specifically.

Smith also said as wealthy 

newcomers 
acquire 
more 

property and high-paying jobs, 
life becomes more expensive for 
the original residents; Monetary 
values go up, residents are evicted 
and policing tactics change, 

based on the composition of the 
neighborhoods.

“After a time, the level of wealth 

in 
gentrified 
neighborhoods 

begins to rise exponentially,” 
he said. “The richer replace the 
rich, high-rise condos begin to 
erase even middle-class housing, 
anyone who is not rich or at least 
middle class is displaced and 
gentrification 
begins 
spilling 

over into other, less gentrified 
neighborhoods.”

Smith said every time a new 

high-rise development goes up 
in Ann Arbor, the rent goes up 
approximately 
two 
percent, 

even though the quality of the 
residence has not changed. 

Students 
have 
expressed 

concern 
over 
the 
new 

developments, such as the one 
going up on South Univeristy, as 
it results in increasing rent costs 
and a lack of affordable housing 
options. 

Smith 
explained 

gentrification is the result of city 
councils providing tax breaks 
and cheap land to businesses 
that move into impoverished 
cities, as well as landlords 
who raise rents and evict 
longtime residents to attract 
new residents who are able to 
pay more, among several other 
factors.

Casey Adams, who works with 

RYA and led the presentation 
with Smith, explained there are 
very few manufacturing jobs 
available in Ypsilanti, and so 
people who do not have a college 
education are pushed into jobs 
in food service or retail.

Adams noted there is a push 

for people to go to college, but 
that college tuition, such as at 
the University of Michigan, is 
increasing 
dramatically; 
she 

also noted the median income of 
University students’ families is 
well above the average median 
income.

Every Monday, the 
Michigan Daily will be 
publishing a photo found 
from the Daily’s archives 
of an important part of 
University of Michigan 
history.

for this.”

The initiative allows people aged 

21 and over to purchase and possess 
up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana or 15 
grams of marijuana concentrate 
and grow up to 12 marijuana plants 
in their homes for personal use. 
If passed, municipalities would 
be permitted to ban marijuana 
retailers and businesses within 
their 
jurisdictions, 
and 
public 

consumption and driving under the 
influence of marijuana would be 
forbidden.

If the initiative makes it onto the 

ballot in 2018, Hovey feels confident 
it will pass. National support for 
recreational marijuana is at 61 
percent, according to a CBS poll 
from April of this year, and Hovey 
says the numbers in Michigan 
are about the same. A Michigan 
Daily poll of 71 randomly selected 
students found that 72 percent of 
respondents would support such an 
initiative, with 13 percent opposed 
and 15 percent unsure. 96 percent 
of respondents said they supported 
medicinal 
marijuana, 
with 
4 

percent unsure.

Hovey said the group’s primary 

motivations for pushing to legalize 
recreational marijuana are the 
ineffectiveness 
of 
the 
current 

marijuana laws and the resources 
wasted on enforcement of these 
laws.

“We firmly believe that, just 

like with alcohol, the prohibition 
of marijuana has been a massive 
failure,” he said. “One, it hasn’t 
stopped people from using. Two, 
it unnecessarily is a waste of law 

enforcement resources and it puts 
tens of thousands of people into 
the criminal justice system every 
year for using what is essentially a 
plant that has been found to be less 
harmful than tobacco, less harmful 
than alcohol.”

Fifty-nine percent of respondents 

to the Daily’s survey said they had 
used marijuana for recreational 
purposes at least once in the past. 
The same percentage –– though not 
necessarily the same respondents –– 
said the legalization of recreational 
marijuana would not increase their 
likelihood of using. Thirty-one 
percent said it would, and 10 percent 
said they were unsure.

LSA senior Enrique Zalamea, 

president 
of 
the 
University’s 

chapter of College Republicans, 
said he supported the legalization 
of recreational marijuana both for 
ideological and practical reasons.

“My 
main 
reason, 
coming 

from a conservative background, 
in supporting recreational use 
is mainly because I don’t believe 
that the government should tell 
individuals what they can and can’t 
do in certain regards, especially if 
this is a plant that has been used for 
medical purposes,” Zalamea said. 
“There’s not very much scientific 
background that it does cause heart 
attacks or cause all of the different 
medical complications that people 
make it out to.”

Additionally, he said, the state 

could save a substantial amount 
of money if it did not have to 
enforce the current prohibition on 
recreational marijuana.

“There’s such a huge cost that’s 

incurred when you try and police 
marijuana and enforce the illegal 
aspect of marijuana. We could 

use the kind of money that states 
spend on enforcing small amounts 
of marijuana to keep real criminals 
in prison, for infrastructure, for 
education.”

And 
funding 
infrastructure 

and education is precisely what 
the proposal would do. In addition 
to the state’s 6 percent sales tax, 
there would be a 10 percent excise 
tax levied on the sale of marijuana. 
Thirty percent of the revenue from 
that tax would go to counties and 
municipalities 
with 
marijuana 

retailers, 35 percent would go to 
the state’s school aid fund for K-12 
education, and 35 percent would go 
to the state’s transportation fund, 
which funds repairs of roads and 
bridges.

Though passage of the law 

would be a radical change for most 
of the state, marijuana possession 
has been decriminalized in Ann 
Arbor since 1972. Public Policy 
senior Rowan Conybeare, chair of 
the University’s chapter of College 
Democrats, said she thinks the 
disparity 
between 
Ann 
Arbor 

and the rest of the state, and the 
discriminatory enforcement of the 
law, is unfair. 

“It’s 
a 
low-level 
drug. 
It’s 

decriminalized in Ann Arbor –– 
you get a $25 fine and that’s it,” 
Conybeare said. “And it’s crazy 
that in other places people are 
getting arrested and incarcerated. 
I think it’s also important to look 
at the racial disparities. We’re 
destabilizing these people’s lives for 
a low-level crime when other people 
are just getting off with it.”

Rabhi 
agreed, 
adding 
the 

illegality 
of 
marijuana 
pushes 

people to use it in less-than-safe 
conditions.

“People use marijuana now. The 

prohibition on pot is not working 
in the way that people are thinking 
it’s working,” Rabhi said. “What 
it’s doing is pushing people into the 
shadows who are going to be using 
marijuana anyway, which can lead 
to unsafe conditions for marijuana 
usage. By bringing it out of the 
shadows, we can make sure that 
people are using safe quantities, 
that what they are using is as pure as 
possible and as low of a health risk 
as possible.”

Though the ballot initiative 

appears to be on the brink of 
success, at least in terms of clearing 
the bar of required signatures, it 
isn’t without opposition. Keep Pot 
Out of Neighborhoods and Schools 
is a coalition that emerged to oppose 
the initiative. Gary Gordon, an 
attorney for the group, did not 
respond to requests for comment. 
At a May meeting of the Board of 
State Canvassers reported by the 
Detroit News, however —where 
the wording of the initiative was 
approved by the board — Gordon 
spoke in opposition to the bill’s 
provision allowing homegrown 
marijuana.

“They don’t have to be licensed 

and they are not taxed,” he said. 
“There’s not regulation at all on 
that.”

According to a press release 

from 
the 
group, 
they 
are 

“committed to making certain 
every 
citizen, 
especially 
our 

kids, are protected from the 
unregulated 
proliferation 
of 

pot being made available across 
Michigan.”

have considered it, but I just 
thought that was the best way at 
the time.”

According to Austin McCoy, 

Michigan Mellon Humanities 
Postdoctoral 
fellow, 
tweeting 

pictures of racially charged flyers 
found on campus is just what 
you shouldn’t do –– a lesson he, 
too, learned the hard way after 
posting pictures of racist flyers he 
found.

“We posted them on social 

media, mostly as a way to raise 
awareness of what’s going on. 
Like, ‘This happened, here’s 
proof.’ But then, three hours, I 
just started getting all kinds of 
nasty tweets that were either 
reinforcing the messages on 
the flyer, or just attacking me 
personally,” McCoy said. “But 
then I was like, ‘Okay, I see what 
they’re doing. They’re basically 
using us trying to raise awareness 
around this to basically hijack it. 
They’re trying to demonstrate 
what they’re doing through what 
we post.’ And that’s when I was 
like, ‘Okay, we just can’t reproduce 
any of their fliers online.’ “

And the public incidents of 

racism on campus have only 
grown 
more 
frequent 
since 

students returned to campus. 
Days before school commenced, 
racially charged writing was 
found on the Rock. On Sept. 17, 
racial slurs were found written 
on the dorm name tags of 
several Black students in West 
Quad. Hours earlier, graffiti was 
found on a mural downtown. 
During a protest of the incidents 
Wednesday 
night, 
a 
man 

observing got out of his car and, 
after shouting profanities and 
racial slurs at students, got into a 
physical altercation with at least 
one student.

The 24-year-old man, who 

was not affiliated with the 
University according to Diane 
Brown, Division of Public Safety 
and Security spokesperson, was 
arrested for disorderly conduct 
and 
later 
released 
pending 

warrant authorization.

“When the investigation is 

completed, it will be submitted 
to 
the 
Washtenaw 
County 

Prosecutor’s Office for review 
and 
authorization 
of 
any 

charges,” Brown wrote in an 
email interview. “That should 
take a few days to a few weeks.”

But more often than not in 

these incidents, the perpetrators’ 
identities 
go 
completely 

unknown. 
Though 
DPSS 

opened an investigation into 

the vandalism at West Quad, 
nothing so far has come of it –– 
perpetrators have not been found 
for any of the racially charged 
graffiti, posters or emails this 
year or last.

Investigations were opened 

into some other incidents as 
well. 
When 
an 
anonymous 

source sent out a series of 
emails to Computer Science and 
Engineering 
undergraduate 

students, threatening to kill 
Black 
and 
Jewish 
students, 

and “spoofing” the emails to 
make them appear to be sent 
by a University professor, DPSS 
opened an investigation to find 
the source, partnering with the 
FBI.

“Spoofing 
incidents, 

particularly with email, can 
be very complex and difficult 
to investigate,” Brown wrote. 
“Often 
these 
investigations 

require 
the 
involvement 
of 

federal partners to work with 
foreign governments to follow 
the international trail.”

Sol Bermann, the University’s 

interim 
chief 
information 

security officer, agreed on the 
difficulty of catching the people 
responsible for emails like the 
ones that were sent.

“It is very difficult to catch the 

perpetrators of these sorts of acts 
because of the wide availability 
of anonymous IT services, like 
email,” Bermann wrote in an 
email interview.

Bermann explained how the 

University goes about finding 
and fixing holes in its online 
network.

“The 
university 
routinely 

monitors 
and 
responds 
to 

reports of new vulnerabilities 
along with information from 
intelligence sources and the 
U-M IT community,” Bermann 
wrote. 
“We 
determine 
the 

risk of any vulnerability that 
could contribute to a serious 
IT security incident, looking at 
factors such as whether exploit 
code 
is 
available, 
whether 

exploits are occurring, if U-M 
systems are at risk, and more. 
Alerts, advisories and notices 
are then sent to the IT Security 
Community and other IT groups. 
Ultimately, 
online 
security 

begins with every student, staff 
and faculty member.”

The DPSS-FBI investigation, 

however, remains open. For 
Thomas 
and 
many 
other 

students, that fact doesn’t inspire 
confidence in the ability of the 
University to protect them from 
such attacks.

has been serving the University 
since 1982. In 1992, it became 
the University’s official retailer, 
taking over a space in Yost Ice 
Arena. 

M Den owner Scott Hirth said 

they are currently working to 
further expand their retail space.

“We’ve been doing this a long 

time and we’ve been trying to 
address all parts of the Michigan 
market,” Hirth said. “We just 
were able to take over the space 
above the Victors Collection, so 
there’s about 4,500 square feet 
that is under construction right 
now that is going to become a new 
expanded women’s department.”

Hirth says this new space should 

be completed by homecoming 
weekend on Oct. 27 and will be 

revolutionary to the collegiate 
apparel market for women.

“It’s going to be the biggest 

women’s department in all of 
college campuses,” Hirth said. 
“It’s 
the 
women’s 
segment 

of the market that, frankly, 
manufacturers 
haven’t 
done 

a good enough job on. That’s 
changing, and it’s not as good as 
it needs to be yet but it’s certainly 
moving in the right direction.”

The M Den has also recently 

begun to bring in bigger brands, 
including the University’s switch 
to Nike and Pink by Victoria’s 
Secret, the newest addition.

“The key driver to us doing 

that expansion is the arrival of 
Pink,” Hirth said. “For college-
aged women, that brand is highly 
sought after. And if you’ve seen 
the product, it’s great product.”

“It’s gonna be like nobody has 

seen before,” Hirth added.

The M Den is not the only 

retailer conscious of the failure to 
provide equal quantities of sports 
apparel to women. A League of 
Our Own, a company founded by 
LSA sophomore Gabrielle Gedeon 
and 
Engineering 
sophomore 

Lauren 
Reynolds, 
produces 

University-inspired athletic hats 
that are designed specifically for 
women.

“I created a brand of hats 

because I realized that there is 
such a demand for ball caps for 
women and there aren’t really 
well-fitting 
hats 
out 
there,” 

Gedeon said. “It’s a relaxed fit, it’s 
not as structured as a man’s hat.”

Gedeon and Reynolds were 

roommates last year at South 
Quad, where the idea initially took 
off.

“I never used to wear hats 

until I saw this lady come in with 
her big box of hats,” Gedeon said 

describing her first encounter with 
Reynolds. “She got me a Michigan 
hat and I’m obsessed with it, and I 
wanted to create my own. I knew 
what people were looking for.”

A League of Our Own is not 

just a hat company. According to 
their website’s mission statement: 
“Baseball caps are usually made 
for the male audience, A League 
of Our Own has tailored hats 
just for women. Our feminine 
design starts with college women 
who are in a position to evoke 
change. We strive to influence 
and empower our community to 
create the lives that they want to 
lead.”

Reynolds added their focus is 

to empower women and disrupt 
the male-dominated realm of 
sports.

that would require a $5 student 
membership fee each semester 
in order to provide funds for 
the 
scholarship 
Leadership 

Engagement 
Scholarship, 
Joe 

Shea, former CSG communications 
director, expressed his support for 
the resolution.

“The idea behind this resolution 

is one of solidarity,” Shea said 
in January. “As students, we 
understand how expensive it is 
just to go here … I try to remember 
that for some people at this 
university, it is simply not possible, 
and that is where something 
like the Leadership Engagement 
Scholarship comes into play.”

This $5 fee faced some backlash, 

however, 
as 
several 
students 

and administrators felt it was 
contradictory to the scholarship’s 
purpose. When the resolution 
was originally introduced, Andy 
Snow, former Rackham student 
representative, 
articulated 
his 

displeasure with the idea of a 
student fee.

“At the end of the day, I don’t 

care that it’s generally going to 
help students who need money — 
I see the student fee as basically 
a regressive tax for students the 
most, in general, and I do find it 
massively, massively insulting that 
we just act like financial aid covers 
it,” Snow said in January. “People 
take out loans and pay, not only 
that fee, but finally pay back quite a 
bit when they finally get the money 
to do it, so without reducing where 
people pay, I will not be able to 
support this.”

Those 
organizing 
the 

scholarship hope to have its funds 
available by the fall of 2018. These 
funds, however, will no longer 
come from the student fee. Griggs 
stated while this method has been 
discontinued, 
fundraising 
and 

advocacy events will continue to 
be utilized to raise both the monies 
and advocacy.

“In 
the 
past 
we’ve 
done 

fundraising on campus,” she said. 
“We participated in Giving Blue 
Day and that was really successful, 
and we’ve also done fundraising 
and 
received 
donations 
from 

alumni, students, people who 

were heavily involved in student 
organizations on campus while 
they were students here. We use 
a plethora of channels to increase 
funding for the scholarship.”

As an endowed scholarship, 

one with large contributions and a 
permanent establishment, Griggs 
foresees a long future of success 
in 
helping 
students 
achieve 

their goals through leadership 
and campus involvement. She 
also thinks having students at 
the forefront of the scholarship, 
specifically 
by 
spreading 
the 

word and helping to organize 
fundraising, 
the 
scholarship 

will be one that will continue to 
provide assistance for those who 
need it most.

At the end of the 2016-2017 

school year, and at the end of 
Schafer and Griggs’ terms as CSG 
President and Vice President, 
Schafer, in an interview with the 
Daily, spoke of his pride in the 
initiative and his optimism that 
its success will continue to affect 
students in a positive way.

I

t can be easy to feel 
insulated from national 
events on campus — the 

demands of coursework, social 
involvement and employment 
create 
a 
barrier 
between 

our world, campus and the 
larger country. The nature of 
academia, though, means that 
we must be more alert than 
average; 
our 
responsibility 

to be politically engaged is 
enhanced, not diminished, by 
our status as students. 

But sometimes, important 

pieces 
of 
legislation 
often 

remain ignored by students. 
One 
such 
example 
is 
the 

Sportsmen’s 
Heritage 
and 

Recreational 
Enhancement 

Act, which House Republicans 
have recently sent to the floor 
for a vote after a brief, tasteful 
pause on debate following the 
shooting of Steve Scalise, R-La., 
House 
of 
Representatives 

Majority Whip.

Among other things, the 

bill would dramatically loosen 
regulations pertaining to gun 
silencers, making them much 
easier to obtain. Ostensibly to 
protect the hearing of hunters 
and other responsible gun 
owners, this bill — in serving 
no benefit beyond alternatives 
like 
inexpensive 
hearing 

protection — exists to soothe 
fears in the short term at the 
cost 
of 
significant 
human 

damage in the long term.

Silencers, also referred to as 

“suppressors,” were invented 
in the early 20th century and 
quickly put to use by the United 
States’s military. Most states 
allow for the purchase and use 
of silencers, though federal 
law seems to recognize their 
criminal danger: Violent crimes 
committed 
with 
a 
silencer 

carry a minimum sentence of 
thirty years in prison.

Silencers, 
as 
of 
today, 

face somewhat burdensome 
regulation — they require a 

$200 transfer tax and have a 
license waiting time of up to 
nine months. In addition to 
this, they can cost more than 
$1,000. All of these factors 
work to make silencers fairly 
rare; there are fewer than one 
million being used by civilians 
in the United States, compared 
to nearly 300 million guns. 
SHARE would reverse this.

At 
risk 
of 
being 

controversial, I don’t believe 
you need a silencer to hunt 
deer, as is legal in 40 states. 
At even greater risk, I don’t 
believe you need a silencer 
for self-defense (neither you 
nor the person causing you to 
fear for your life will be in a 
position to mind the noise).

SHARE is opposed by many 

police organizations and gun 
control groups, and for good 
reason. Silencers decrease a 
weapon’s recoil, allowing for 
greater accuracy. They also, 
of course, disguise the gun’s 
noise, potentially making it 
harder for targets to identify 
a shooter. It’s important to 
remember we aren’t discussing 
a toy to be used in gun clubs 
or a novel alternative to ear 
protection — these are devices 
designed explicitly to increase 
one’s ability to kill. 

A 
cynical 
faction 
of 

Democrats 
has 
suggested 

the gun debate is one the left 
should retreat from — that 
gun control must be sacrificed 
to other political priorities. 
This speculation, I think, fails 
to consider the real point of 
being — and voting — “pro-
gun.” This segment of the 
electorate 
doesn’t 
comprise 

constitutional 
purists 

who want to protect their 
interpretation of the framers’ 
intent, it comprises people who 
are afraid — afraid of inadequacy, 
of the “other,” of being vulnerable 
to 
the 
Democrats 
and 

government overreach.

I characterize them this 

way because there were about 
750,000 guns sold the month 
following the Sept. 11 attacks, 
but more than one million 
the month following Barack 
Obama’s first election and 
roughly two million following 
his 
re-election. 
Sales 
rose 

again toward the end of Hillary 
Clinton’s 
2016 
presidential 

campaign, when she seemed 
guaranteed to win.

It 
would 
be 
ridiculous 

for the left to sacrifice this 
issue because of an opposing 
argument 
based 
in 
fear, 

especially a fear of them, 
their 
political 
opposition. 

Backtracking on gun control 
thus fails to win votes and leaves 
the country without a coalition 
saying, “Perhaps we should 
reign in the civilian ability to 
cause massive loss of life, both 
to themselves and to others.”

I 
would 
be 
remiss 
not 

to mention the Democrats 
actually supporting this bill. 
I don’t understand what, even 
with possible threats in 2018 
and 2020, a Democrat has to 
fear simply holding the line on 
gun restrictions. Conservative 
voters won’t remember or care 
that you voted for SHARE, 
and 
your 
left-wing 
base 

will see it as a betrayal. The 
reward — whether measured 
in votes gained or campaign 
dollars from the National Rifle 
Association — is minuscule 
compared to the risk.

As Donald Trump decries 

“bad dudes on both sides,” and 
as Republicans warn of the 
“militant left,” I would appeal 
to 
House 
members’ 
self-

interest: if not for the safety 
of your country and its people, 
for your own.

Straight men need safe spaces, too

BEN BUGAJSKI | OP-ED

S

pider-Man: 
Homecoming” was not 
a particularly important 

nor 
life-altering 
must-see 

movie of the summer. But when 
I left the theater, something was 
off. I couldn’t figure out why 
I was so bothered by the edgy, 
cynical character that Zendaya 
plays; I agreed with everything 
she was saying! When she 
looked up at the Washington 
Monument and refused to go 
inside because it was built by 
slaves, I was slow-clapping 
along with her. The movie 
mentions, but fails to unpack 
or 
address, 
other 
societal 

problems through a liberal 
lens, from the correcting of 
“Indian” to “Native American” 
to a visible demonstration of 
the tension between white- and 
blue-collar workers. I’m pretty 
sure this is the first Marvel film 
to open with a line shutting 
down racism.

But at another point in the 

film, 
Zendaya’s 
character 

mentions that she’s going to 
protest without detailing what 
exactly she’s protesting. In 
this, her “cool” revolutionary 
attitude 
transformed 
into 

something 
reminiscent 
of 

the notorious Kendall Jenner 
Pepsi commercial — idealizing 
a purposeless gathering of 
people who “protest” because 
it’s 
fun 
and 
hip, 
not 
as 

substantial, tactical resistance 
to state violence.

It 
appears, 
then, 
that 

Zendaya’s 
character 
was 

written as an archetype — to 
make the film seem “woke.”

We see this capitalization 

on 
radical 
anti-capitalist 

movements outside the movie 
theater, too. Walk into any 
shopping mall in the United 
States and I bet you can find 
five different blouses with the 
word FEMINIST emblazoned 
on them. Maybe in sequins. 
I 
wonder: 
Do 
the 
people 

purchasing these cute tees 
that broadcast their liberal 
beliefs realize that partaking 
in this transaction supports 
the 
capitalist 
pressures 
of 

fast 
fashion, 
an 
industry 

that often employs women in 
underprivileged countries to 

work in dangerous conditions? 
Do they realize supporting 
stores like H&M supports the 
hyper-competitive 
capitalist 

system that breeds inequality, 
not 
only 
socioeconomically 

but amongst sexes, sexualities, 
races, religions and ethnicities?

It raises these questions: Are 

we bad people for buying these 
shirts? Are we bad people for 
paying $8 at Goodrich Quality 
Theaters to watch Tom Holland 
take his shirt off and Zendaya 
recite carefully crafted lines 
about 
political 
awareness? 

How many elephants are your 
elephant pants saving after 
the cotton has been grown 
and fertilized and processed 
and dyed and packaged and 
shipped to your house?

This is where the jury’s 

still out. Because even though 
there’s something inherently 
antithetical to corporations 
and businesses making money 
off 
our 
anti-consumerist, 

anti-capitalist, 
pro-equity 

mentality, perhaps there is 
something to be said about how 
proud people are to be radical, 
liberal and feminist in 2017. 
Maybe it’s a good thing that 
we are wearing our identities 
on our sleeves – literally – if 
that means conversations are 
starting and people are joining 
the movement. Maybe some 
people will walk away from this 
Spider-Man 
movie 
inspired 

by Zendaya’s character and 
participate in the next protest 
or vigil on campus. If you go 
to a protest just to post about 
it on social media, despite its 
paid ads and sponsorships, 
you still went, right? You were 

counted just like everyone who 
didn’t post about it. You might 
have been less engaged, doing 
it for liberal brownie points, 
but you did go.

It’s impossible to tell what 

the net impact of this marketing 
technique is going to be. If 
some 
commercial 
producer 

thought that showing Kendall 
Jenner in a protest would get 
more people to buy Pepsi, 
doesn’t that say something 
wonderful about our political 
landscape, even if the video 
was crude and disingenuous? 
It does signal that the exercise 
of our First Amendment rights 
of assembly and free speech 
are important to young people. 
We are getting political, and 
we are demanding to be heard.

If these capitalist trends 

are mere reflections of our 
cultural values in the 21st 
century, then it’s incredibly 
exciting that feminist T-shirts 
and elephant pants are flying 
off shelves. Even if the wrong 
entities 
are 
receiving 
the 

monetary benefits, at least 
our children are growing up 
in a world where it’s cool to 
care about real issues in real 
time. Perhaps the next step is 
recognizing that our values are 
being exploited and realizing 
that we don’t need the Toms, 
the FEMINIST tees or the 
elephant pants to make our 
point.

Don’t get me wrong — I’m 

not preaching to be holier-
than-thou. I shop at these 
malls. I pay for these movies. 
I try my best, but I know that 
in my everyday actions and 
purchases I, too, am surely 
supporting 
and 
upholding 

power structures that I would 
find morally unacceptable if I 
looked a little closer. We live, 
work and play in a capitalist 
society, and it’s only fair that 
we treat ourselves with some 
patience 
and 
forgiveness 

when we get sucked into its 
ploys, 
while 
still 
holding 

industries 
accountable 
for 

their paradoxical products and 
marketing strategies.

S

afe spaces have inspired 
passionate 
debate 

in 
higher 
education: 

They’re 
either 
necessary 

to help students deal with 
microaggressions and trigger 
warnings, or they criticize a 
university for coddling and 
sheltering 
students. 
While 

I 
thankfully 
have 
never 

experienced the need to enter 
a safe space, I believe in the 
premise of safe spaces to help 
students process the painful 
parts of becoming adults and 
facing real challenges in the 
world. That’s why, as a male 
feminist, I believe that straight 
men need safe spaces, too. 

Safe spaces for men have 

been described and defended 
by 
one 
such 
safe 
space 

moderator at the University of 
British Columbia, Ryan Avola. 
He argues that to combat toxic 
masculinity, men need a space 
to talk out their conceptions 
of gender. Otherwise, they 
force women and people of 
color to have the conversation 
for them. I agree with this; 
however, I also think the 
discourse surrounding gender 
has been radicalized by both 
feminists and conservatives, 
creating a vicious feedback 
loop of more and more extreme 
positions. If the end goal is 
to educate straight men on 
the complexities of privilege, 
insulating 
them 
among 

themselves is the first step to 
stopping this cycle.

Toxic 
masculinity 
is 
a 

form 
of 
masculinity 
that 

enforces 
and 
perpetuates 

sexual conquest and violence. 
Critics have argued toxic 
masculinity leads to domestic 
violence and gun violence, 
and it imprisons men just as 
much at it harms women.

Most 
importantly, 
toxic 

masculinity reinforces itself 
throughout a man’s life. From 
an effeminate boy being called 
a “faggot” to a sensitive teen 
being told to “grow a pair” 
to a cooperative man being 
urged 
to 
“take 
control,” 

toxic 
masculinity 
breeds 

competition and domination 
among men. This creates a 
system 
where 
competition, 

loudly voicing your opinion 
and 
stoicism 
are 
valued 

and “feminine” values like 
cooperation, listening to others 
and expressing your emotions 
are, literally, defeated.

These “manly” values were 

certainly useful at a time. 
Back when we were hunter-
gatherers, it was important to 
have someone who shot first 
and listened after because we 
faced so many bodily threats. 
However, humanity has evolved 
beyond our primitive roots, and 
now traits like working in a team 
and 
communicating 
verbally 

are valued highly by none other 
than 
Forbes. 
Guess 
which 

gender these are traditionally 

associated with? Not maleness.

All 
this 
is 
to 
say that 

masculinity must evolve to 
adapt to a new world where 
communication 
conquers 

competition, where listening 
trounces 
overpowering 

opinions and where expressing 
empathy edges out emotional 
indifference. To overcome this, 
straight men need spaces to talk 

about gender without women.

As a Women’s Studies major, 

I am comfortable talking about 
gender and the pitfalls of 
masculinity. However, I have 
yet to encounter a Women’s 
Studies class (and especially a 
discussion section of a class) in 
which men aren’t unilaterally 
designated the problem of life. 
I have often felt uncomfortable 
expressing a more moderate 
opinion 
in 
polarized, 

radicalized spaces, which is 
detrimental 
to 
educational 

conversations in academia and 
gender politics in general. This 
implicit policing of discourse 
perpetuates 
the 
idea 
that 

men themselves are the issue 
when, in reality, the problem 
is toxic masculinity.

Female feminists: Imagine 

you’re told that something you 
can’t control — your gender — 
is everything wrong with the 
world. The point of criticizing 
men’s actions is to criticize the 
toxic masculinity that inspired 
them. However, this nuance 
is 
often 
lost 
in 
one-sided 

conversations that devolve into 
a laundry list of (legitimate) 
harms that toxic masculinity 
has 
inflicted 
upon 
women 

and people of color. There is a 
critical difference in criticizing 
the dominant expression of 
maleness and criticizing the 
unknowing expresser of this 
harmful masculinity.

If you were a man, would 

you really listen to the rest of 
the argument? Of course you’d 
get defensive, because why the 
hell wouldn’t you? After a few 
class periods, you’d start to 
hate all the “feminazis” and 
zone out for all the discussions 
of the perpetuation of gender 
inequality. 
There’s 
probably 

a 50-50 chance you’d start 
beginning 
sentences 
with, 

“Well, actually…”

This is exactly why straight 

men need safe spaces to discuss 
gender. 
I 
understand 
and 

identify with feminism, but 
most men don’t understand 
the difference between healthy 
and toxic masculinity. They 
don’t understand that their 
behavior 
is 
perpetuating 

gender 
inequality 
because 

their 
personal 
experiences 

don’t align with accounts of the 
harm they cause. By acting as 
straight men are supposed to 
act, they’ve reaped the rewards 
of oppressing others.

White men, in particular, 

are primed to not understand 
that their race and gender 
advantage them, and having 
women and people of color 
seemingly 
jump 
down 

their 
throats 
about 
their 

very existence makes them 
defensive. It’s not necessarily 
being privileged that stifles 
them 
from 
accepting 
the 

gender and racial hierarchy, 
it’s 
the 
feeling 
of 
being 

attacked that stifles them from 
listening. The very tactics 
feminists have adopted to 
become heard in a patriarchal 
society have alienated men 
and 
stopped 
them 
from 

listening. If in a patriarchal 
society men overpower and 
silence women, then let’s use 
men to spread the message.

Straight men need a space 

where they can accidentally 
misgender someone or make 
an inadvertent misogynistic 
comment or admit that they 
don’t 
understand 
structural 

racism and won’t immediately 
be pounced on. It’s all part 
of 
growing 
pains. 
If 
we 

understood these forces from 
the get-go, then they wouldn’t 
need explanation. This is not to 
say these comments are okay. 
However, undoing a lifetime of 
socialization is a long, tedious 
process and telling someone 
to check their privilege only 
exacerbates the hostility.

And, of course, the people 

who 
benefit 
most 
from 

homophobic, 
misogynistic, 

racist systems are the last to 
realize they’re stacked in their 
favor. The problem is that this 
won’t be fixed until these exact 
people realize they are the 
beneficiaries of the system, 
and while the originally-female 
gender theorists have done 
their piece, at this point what 
men really need are male role 
models of healthy masculinity.

Straight 
men 
need 
safe 

spaces to discuss structural 
inequalities without women 
or people of color because, 
like everyone, they feel most 
comfortable 
listening 
to 

people who share their social 
identities 
and 
experiences, 

which 
is 
what 
a 
safe 

space provides. These are 
uncomfortable conversations, 
and instilling values of equity 
takes time that women and 
people of color understandably 
don’t have the patience for. 
However, until that point is 
reached, then maybe straight 
men need other straight men 
to teach them the error of 
their ways.

Ben Bugajski is an LSA senior.

Masculinity must 
evolve to adapt to 

a new world.
What men really 
need are male role 
models of healthy 

masculinity.

To combat toxic 
masculinity, men 
need a space to 
talk out their 
conceptions of 

gender.

Arts
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Based off the novels by Diana 

Gabaldon, “Outlander” follows 
the story of Claire (Caitriona 
Balfe, “Now You See Me”), 
a young army nurse whose 
single touch to a henge circle 
transports her to the Scottish 
Highlands 
in 
1743. 
Torn 

between two worlds, Claire 
must 
make 
the 
impossible 

decision to remain in the 
past or return to the present, 
where a previous life awaits 
her 
return. 
This 
dualism, 

emphasized often throughout 
the 
series, 
was 
especially 

poignant in the premiere of 
the third season of the steamy 
series, as both Jamie (Sam 

Heughan, 
“Doctors”) 
and 

Claire struggle to adjust to a 
life without one another.

This is mainly accomplished 

through 
quiet 
scenes 
that 

are able to speak volumes, 
sometimes 
without uttering 
a 
single 
word. 

Moments 
as 

simple as a man 
playing bagpipes 
on the corner of 
the 
university 

reminds viewers 
of the double life 
that Claire has 
not only lived, 
but continues to 
live. A Scottish 
song 
playing 

quietly 
and 
unexpectedly 

on the streets is the perfect 

metaphor for the new lifestyle 
which Claire is struggling 
to adapt. Though she has 
returned to her own time and 
is living happily in Boston with 
her husband Frank (Tobias 

Menzies, “Game 
of 
Thrones”), 

a 
part 
of 
her 

still 
remains 

in the Scottish 
Highlands 
with 

Jamie. 
Cooking 

over 
the 
fire 

rather than on 
the 
stove, 
she 

responds almost 
automatically 
that her husband 
much prefers it — 
the line that once 

separated Jamie from Frank is 
beginning to visibly blur.

TV REVIEW

The new series explores the intracacies of Jamie and Claire’s 
relationship as they enter the next chapter of their lives in the show

‘Outlander’ premiere has 
historical roots, romance

STARZ

“Outlander” has returned

“Friend 
Request” 
is 
a 

train 
wreck 
of 
a 
motion 

picture, every bit as stupid 
and borderline offensive as a 
movie with the tagline “Evil 
is trending” is expected to be. 
The trio sitting behind me in 
the theater apparently caught 
on early, and after ten minutes, 
they left, whispering, “If we 
leave now we can make the 
next showing of ‘It.’” If I’d had 
any idea what was about to 
ensue, I would have followed 
them.

The film tells the story of 

Laura (Alycia Debnam-Carey, 
“Fear the Walking Dead”), 
a 
pretty, 
popular, 
perfect 

college student who adds a shy 
girl from one of her classes, 
Marina (Liesl Ahlers, “Inside 
Job”), as a friend online. 
However, after Marina begins 
to exhibit strange behavior, 
Laura unfriends her, leading 
Marina to take her own life. 
Soon people start dying, and 
it becomes apparent that some 
remnant of Marina is still 
terrorizing Laura. But that 
isn’t the worst part. As people 
start dying, Laura starts losing 
friends online. Can she and her 
friends stop this malevolent 
force before more people die? 
And can they do it before, 
unthinkably, her friend count 
hits zero?

On the most basic level 

possible, “Friend Request” is 
a 
monumentally 
ill-advised 

movie. People die frequently 
and horribly, yet the main 
characters 
are 
continually 

interested 
in 
how 
this 
is 

affecting their social media 

image 
instead. 
The 
film 

features 
several 
cutaways 

showing the friend count of 
the main character dropping 
closer and closer to zero, and 
it treats this with the gravest 
importance.

In a smarter movie, this 

might have been played as 
an intentional joke, a satire 
of 
our 
increasingly 
social 

media 
obsessed 
society. 

Unfortunately, 
despite 

attempts 
at 
ham-fisted 

messaging 
about 
internet 

addiction – there are moments 
the screenwriter may as well 
grab you by the throat and 
scream in your face, “SEE! 
THE INTERNET IS EVIL!” 
for all the subtlety on display 
– nothing ever comes of it, 
and it just seems in bad taste. 
Of course, in a story that 
demonizes those with mental 
illness and valorizes the people 
who on more than one occasion 
call the target of their ridicule 
a “bitch,” that’s about par for 
the course.

That leads into the biggest 

problems of “Friend Request,” 
the characters, who are easily 
organizable into two camps. 
There is Laura, who is perfect 
and popular and never does 
anything wrong and is the most 
boring member of the ensemble 
as 
a 
result. 
Then 
there’s 

everyone 
else, 
who 
spend 

their time riddling off relevant 
exposition 
and 
heroically 

insulting a suicide victim. In 
fact, the most sympathetic 
character of the whole ordeal 
is Melanie herself, who is given 
a tragic backstory that means 
her actions, if not condonable, 
are at least understandable.

The horror is riddled with 

the same kind of brainless 
jump 
scares 
that 
always 

populate this sort of flick. 
Every other scene, a character 
wanders off on their own, and 
something jumps out at them 
and 
screams, 
and 
because 

humanity 
has 
a 
fight-or-

flight reflex, we scream, too. 
It’s lazy and predictable, but 
again, it’s par for the course. 
And of course, the whole 
thing wraps up with one last 
scare that makes no sense, but 
as a horror movie in 2017, is 
required to give it the illusion 
of weight. Likeable characters, 
a well thought out plot, and 
competent scares might have 
done the same thing, but that 
would apparently be asking 
just too darn much.

It’s hard to articulate how 

much I hated “Friend Request.” 
I hated the way it vilifies 
those with mental illness and 
implicitly advocates avoiding 
them at all cost. I hated that it 
treats the people who ridicule 
them as some sort of heroes. I 
hated the characters. I hated 
the story. Most of all, I hated 
that just two weeks after “It” 
showed us what an incredible 
cinematic 
experience 
the 

horror genre is capable of 
delivering, “Friend Request” 
is here to remind us of the 
predictable, 
boring, 
insipid 

drivel it usually is.

‘Friend Request’ is every 
bit as insipid as expected

The film is more horrifying in its execution than anything else

FILM REVIEW

What makes a series like 

“Outlander” so different from 
shows of a similar nature is 
their ability to portray the 
historical reality of gruesome 
battle scenes. It’s easy to 
create a wonderfully brutal 
battle scene from scratch, 
but to portray a moment in 
history alongside the familiar 
characters 
is 
something 

special indeed. The Battle 
of 
Culloden, 
from 
which 

the aftermath is depicted in 
the first half of the season 
premiere, is one of the most 
significant clashes in British 
history in a struggle against 
the Jacobite rising. Gruesome 
and bloody, “Outlander” holds 
nothing back in depicting the 
battle and the fall of many 
of last season’s heroes. Most 
of 
which 
is 
told 
through 

flashbacks as Jamie relives 
the most gruesome moments 
of battle in his isolation. From 
walking through the woods 
to lying atop a pile of fallen 
Jacobites, Jamie is obviously 
living in his own personal hell, 
mourning the loss of Claire all 
the while.

Though each season brings 

a new chapter into the lives 
of Jamie and Claire, one thing 

that fans can always count on 
are the misty eyes that are 
likely to occur when watching 
“Outlander.” Whether it be 
through 
Jamie’s 
anguish 

conveyed in a single look or 
the young Jacobites who are 
physically led to their own 

execution, this season is no 
exception to the pulling of the 
heartstrings. As much as Jamie 
suffers, as does Claire, which 
is, of course, reflected in a 
more modern sense. Deciding 
to complete her education 
in medical school, she faces 
blatant discrimination which 
serves to remind us of a time 

not so long ago. But it’s not only 
her 
professional 
reputation 

that suffers under the weight 
of another life. At home, Frank 
smoothly accepts Jamie’s child 
as his own, though he struggles 
to share Claire with Jamie. 
But with good reason. Even in 
the throes of passion, Claire 
cannot look Frank in the eyes, 
preferring to simply make 
love to her husband. Except 
her husband lies separated in 
the past by 200 years and far 
across the Atlantic.

Not 
only 
does 
the 

“Outlander” 
premiere 

encompass the best of the 
series, but also the best of the 
reality of Claire and Jamie’s 
situations. While it’s obvious 
that 
Claire’s 
marriage 
to 

Frank is all but destroyed by 
her devotion to her rough and 
rugged husband, it’s a sharp 
blow to see the mournful 
reality of a marriage destined 
to fail play out on screen. 
However, as Jamie struggles 
more than we’ve ever seen 
him, 
we 
cannot 
help 
but 

anticipate a welcome reunion 
between the lovers. After all, 
history does have a tendency 
to repeat itself.

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW
Value the Voice: toward 
inclusivity on our campus

A new series based around the art of storytelling is coming 
to UMMA starting this Tuesday. The theme? ‘Transitions’

“Imagine a ‘TED talk’ that 

doesn’t sound scripted and 
isn’t lecture-style, but is more 
so just me telling you a story 
about how I didn’t have a spoon 
to stir my Kool-Aid, and I woke 
everybody 
up 
on 
Saturday 

morning in the residence halls 
trying to find a spoon to stir 
my Kool-Aid and the valuable 
lessons that I learned from 
that.”

As 
described 
by 

Comprehensive 
Studies 

Program 
(CSP) 
Academic 

Advisor 
Keith 
Jason, 
who 

spearheaded the event, “Value 
the Voice” is just that: A 
storyteller’s lounge.

“It’s 
the 
person’s 
story, 

so we’re asking them to tell 
real 
stories,” 

Jason 
said. 

“Not 
myths 

or legends or 
anything 
like 

that. But, [to] 
communicate 
their 
own 

experiences 
in 
their 
own 

authentic voice 
and share their 
experiences 
so that other 
people 
can 

learn 
from 

those.”

Making 

its debut this 
Tuesday 
at 

the 
UMMA, 

the event will 
have 
four 

installments 
(in September, 
November, 
January 
and 

March). 
The 

theme of this 
first 
one 
is 

“Transitions.” 
A new city, a new school 
year, a new challenge — the 
evening will focus on all of the 
transition-related experiences 
and sentiments that matter to 
its storytellers.

The event will include about 

seven stories, five of which 
will be told by students. The 
other two will be by Dr. Harold 
Waters, director of CSP, and 

Elizabeth James, the Program 
Associate in Afro-American 
and African Studies. Coined as 
“voices of wisdom,” they’ll be 
there to share moments of their 
lives that may speak to the 
social and political landscapes 
both 
within 

and 
beyond 

the 
University 

community.

“It’s sad, but it’s 

reality that these 
kinds 
of 
tough 

times 
are 
not 

new,” Jason said. 
“I 
don’t 
think 

our culture that’s 
40 
and 
under 

does the best job 
of reaching out 
to 
those 
folks 

who’ve 
lived 

through it in their 
time and how they 
overcame those challenges.”

Elizabeth 

James, 
a 
Daily 

Arts 
alum 
and 

incredible 
force 

of 
compassion, 

shared with the 
Daily what she 
hopes 
to 
come 

from 
being 
a 

“voice of wisdom” 
for the night.

“I 
can 

remember certain 
great 
moments 

in 
my 
classes, 

but most of all, 
I 
remember 

the things that 
happened outside 
of class,” James 
said. “[It] means 
all the world to 
me if I can help 
anybody or help 
their way be a 
little easier. I feel 
like what I went 
through is worth 
it, because it’s not 
something 
that 

I’ve left and just 

held in my heart.”

A 
third-generation 

storyteller, James grew up 
understanding the power of 
sharing. 
Her 
grandmother 

was a traditional healer down 
in New Orleans, Louisiana, 
using stories to calm the 
patients that came to see her. 
Her mother, also an alum, told 
stories through her night-time 

radio show in Detroit.

“Somewhere between the 

two, I think I fall. And I’m 
really happy, because I feel like 
I’m a bridge between all three 
of the generations. That’s very 
meaningful for me because 

I feel like I’m 
carrying 
their 

approval 
and 

carrying it on,” 
she said.

Passing 

down 
tradition, 

surveying 
the 
present, 

informing 
the 

future — “Value 
the 
Voice” 
is 

a 
safe 
space 

for 
people 

to 
examine 

themselves 
and 
experience 

belonging in a 

University setting that can 
sometimes be isolating.

“It’s so important, because 

I feel as though the sense of 
community is being shattered,” 
James said. “We need to return 
to that idea of what community 
means and feels like… Just 
knowing that you have every 
right to be here, and that your 
voice matters; that’s what I 
think my key intent is with this 
program. That’s why we called 
it ‘Value the Voice.’”

“You know, we’ve got two 

different things going on — the 
climate of the country and the 
climate of the earth — all of 
these things are coming at us, 
and it’s very easy to lose track 
of who we are and that we’re 
better together and stronger 
together… If we want to be, 
I think, our highest level of 
humankind, I really think that 
means you have to be able to 
share,” James said. “Share your 
toys, share your stories, share. 
You get more back when you 
share than you ever imagined 
you could.”

The world is a better place 

because people like Elizabeth 
James and Keith Jason do what 
they do. “Value the Voice” will 
challenge you and love you like 
only the best nights can. Go 
in with an open heart, and let 
yourself explore the inclusivity 
and healing that comes from 
simply sharing. It’ll be worth 
it.

‘Stronger’ explores the story of Jeff Bauman
‘Stronger’ appropriately 
complicates Boston Strong

David Gordan Green’s recent film starring Jake Gyllenhaal 
tells the story of a Boston marathon runner who lost his legs

“Stronger” is the real-life 

story of Jeff Bauman, a native 
Bostonian who lost his legs 
in the 2013 Boston Marathon 
bombing and became a symbol 
of hope for the city in the 
trying time following. In this 
captivating and intensely sad 
film, director David Gordon 
Green (“Our Brand Is Crisis”) 
seamlessly explores Bauman’s 
deep internal struggle and 
his 
relationships 
with 
his 

family 
and 
his 
girlfriend, 

while also emphasizing the 
collective grief felt by the 
city of Boston. With deeply 
moving 
performances 
by 

Jake Gyllenhaal (“Okja”) and 
Tatiana 
Maslany 
(“Orphan 

Black”), 
“Stronger” 
moves 

slowly and powerfully. The 
film portrays love, adversity 
and the human condition in 
a wholly genuine and heart-
wrenching 
story 
centered 

around two people’s devotion 
to each other.

Bauman’s 
story 
is 

masterfully 
expressed 
by 

Gyllenhaal, an actor who has 
proven time and again his 
incredible range and depth 
of 
emotion. 
While 
critical 

discourse questions the ability 
and 
morality 
of 
an 
able-

bodied actor playing a disabled 
character, 
Gyllenhaal’s 

eloquent performance rewards 
the casting of a deeply interior 
actor rather than focusing 
on the ability of the actor’s 

body. As Bauman, Gyllenhaal 
communicates 
the 
physical 

trials of even the most mundane 
things 
after 
his 
double 

amputation, 
such 
as 
going 

to the bathroom and getting 
out of bed. His physicality 
as an actor is unbelievable; 
Gyllenhaal moves his body in a 
way that works to eliminate the 
distinction between his actual 
body and the one he portrays on 
screen. While this discrepancy 
is understandably problematic, 
it is emotional and convincing 
nonetheless. Gyllenhaal also 
portrays Bauman’s emotional 

turmoil, 
his 
surface-level 

reliance on humor in response 
to his condition in contention 
with a deeper interrogation of 
himself as a man.

The film not only centers 

around 
Bauman’s 
personal 

struggle following the Boston 
Marathon bombing, but also 
on 
his 
relationship 
with 

his 
girlfriend 
Erin 
Hurley 

(Maslany). 
Their 
on-again 

off-again 
relationship 
is 

complicated 
when 
Bauman 

shows up to support Hurley 
in 
the 
marathon, 
which 

inevitably ends traumatically 

for both of them. However, the 
trauma only further solidifies 
their 
personal 
connection 

as the two navigate love, 
understanding and selfishness. 
This relationship is the driving 
force 
of 
the 
film, 
deeply 

honest in its portrayal of 
human connection. Maslany 
is 
spectacular, 
expressing 

devotion 
and 
confusion 
in 

subtle and intertwined ways, 
exemplified in her consistent 
clashing 
with 
Bauman’s 

mother (Miranda Richardson, 
“Testament of Youth”). With 
her 
dynamic 
performance 

Maslany solidifies her place as 
a high caliber actor in tandem 
with Gyllenhaal.

The film’s ultimate strength 

lies in its avoidance of clichés in 
telling the Marathon bombing 
narrative. In other words, the 
film doesn’t over-dramatize 
the event and its aftermath. 
The bombing itself happens 
almost 
quietly, 
without 

jarring 
camera 
movements 

or suspenseful music; Green 
forgoes drama and instead 
relies 
on 
the 
audience’s 

common understanding of the 
gravity of the event. Moreover, 
the film does not shy away 
from 
painful 
but 
genuine 

moments 
in 
the 
narrative. 

One of the most memorable 
scenes in the film is the one 
in which the nurses change 
Bauman’s 
wound 
dressing, 

and he feels for the first time 
the excruciating pain of his 
amputated legs. This scene is 
long and straightforward and 
raw, and acutely honest. Due in

transition-related 
experiences and

matter to its 
storytellers

large part to the writing based 
on Jeff Bauman’s own memoir, 
“Stronger” 
is 
distinguished 

by its ability to convey drama 
without dramatic tropes.

Finally, 
“Stronger” 
also 

challenges 
the 
survivor 

narrative, 
complicating 
the 

term “hero” and humanizing 
the process of dealing with 
trauma. 
One 
of 
the 
main 

threads of the film is the 
Bauman 
family’s 
effort 
to 

substantialize 
the 
city 
of 

Boston’s idolization of Bauman 
as a hero, transforming him 
into a symbol for Boston Strong. 
However, the film challenges 
this process and focuses on 
Bauman’s 
relationship 
with 

the word “hero,” his PTSD and 
his love for the city. Ultimately, 
“Stronger” 
explores 
the 

tensions 
involved 
in 
the 

commodification 
of 
trauma 

and the exploitative nature of 

turning Bauman into a symbol 
of hope, while simultaneously 
emphasizing 
the 
incredible 

importance of community in 
Boston and the collective bond 
shared by its people. Though 
layered in its portrayal of 
Boston Strong, the film is a 
testament to the collective 
strength of the city and the 
inspirational 
importance 
of 

Jeff Bauman.

On Saturday afternoon in 
West Lafayette, John O’Korn 
found more than a victory, as 
his winding path of a college 
career finally received some 
closure. » Page 4B

WEST 

LAFAYETTE 
— 
The 
biggest 

crowd 
at 
Purdue 

in nearly a decade 
watched in silence 
as Michigan redshirt 
junior 
quarterback 

Wilton Speight laid 
motionless 
on 
the 

ground.

Speight 
had 
been 

slammed for an 11-yard 
sack, and a second hit 
from behind crunched 
Speight’s neck as he fell 
to the ground.

Speight 
left 
injured 

midway through the first 
quarter, but led by fifth-
year 
senior 
quarterback 

John O’Korn, the eighth-
ranked Wolverines (1-0 Big 
Ten, 4-0 overall) rallied 

for a 28-10 win.

With 
Speight 
out, 

O’Korn 

completely 

took 
over. 
He 

completed 69 percent of his 
passes for 270 yards and one 
touchdown.

“I thought John really 

played great,” said Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh. “He 
was seeing things really 
good right from the time 
he came into the ball game. 
(He) ran the offense well, 
made the big plays.”

On the first scoring drive, 

O’Korn went 5-for-5 in the 
air for 61 yards and ended 
the drive with a 10-yard 
touchdown pass to redshirt 
sophomore tight end Zach 
Gentry.

And each drive, O’Korn 

continued to improve in the 
pocket.

On 
the 
Wolverines’ 

second 
scoring 
drive, 

O’Korn went 5-for-9 with 73 
passing yards. Sophomore 
running 
back 
Chris 

Evans capped the drive 
with a 10-yard rushing 
touchdown, going straight 
up the gut for the score.

On 
Michigan’s 
third 

scoring 
drive, 
O’Korn 

connected on all three of his 
passes for three first downs 
and 65 yards. Another fifth-
year senior, running back 
Ty Isaac, dove one yard for 
a touchdown.

To put the game out of 

reach, Evans rushed for his 
second touchdown in the 
fourth 
quarter, 
breaking 

past the line of scrimmage 
for a 49-yard score. Evans 
ended with 97 yards on 15 
carries.

For the first time this 

season, 
the 
Wolverines’ 

offense 
excelled, 
and 
it 

started with O’Korn.

Though 
Michigan 
had 

struggled all season in the 
red zone, it was perfect 
against the Boilermakers 
(0-1, 2-2). The Wolverines 
converted 
all 
three 
of 

their 
red-zone 
trips 
for 

touchdowns. 
They 
were 

1-for-10 in that category 
prior to the game.

“It 
was 
nice 
to 
see 

something that was stressed 
so much all week carry into 
the game,” O’Korn said. 

“We were 3-for-3 in the red 
zone, and the work we put in 
as a team paid off.”

Depending on Speight’s 

diagnosis, O’Korn may be 
called upon again.

He proved capable of 

commanding 
the 
pocket, 

and displayed an ability 
to 
slip 
past 
tackles 
to 

gain yards in seemingly 
disastrous situations.

And O’Korn saw plenty 

of them. He faced pressure 
from Purdue’s defensive line 
all day, as the Wolverines’ 
offensive line showed their 
inexperience.

The Boilermakers sacked 

Michigan’s 
quarterbacks 

four times. This defensive 
pressure 
helped 
Purdue 

through the first half. At 
the end of two quarters, the 
home team led, 10-7.

The Boilermakers’ two-

quarterback 
system 
had 

troubled the Wolverines’ 
defense 
early 
on, 
but 

Michigan cleaned up the 
mistakes and held Purdue to 
just 10 yards in the second 
half.

Purdue 
quarterbacks 

Elijah 
Sindelar 
(7-for-16, 

103 
passing 
yards, 
one 

touchdown) 
and 
David 

Blough (5-for-13, 32 passing 

yards) continuously used 
trick plays and throwback 
passes 
to 
confuse 
the 

Wolverines. 
Eventually 

Michigan’s defense caught 
on.

“They caught us off guard 

(early),” 
said 
sophomore 

linebacker 
Devin 
Bush. 

“They kept doing it, but we 
just hunkered down and 
played our man.

“… We knew towards the 

end of the game they were 
going to pull out more trick 
plays.”

Redshirt junior defensive 

end Chase Winovich led 
the defense with six tackles 
and three sacks. Bush also 
continued 
his 
successful 

year with six tackles and a 
sack of his own.

Despite 
those 
early 

scares, 
the 
Wolverines 

prevailed.

The extent of Speight’s 

injury is still unknown, 
and when the starter went 
down, O’Korn ran onto the 
field to help him up.

“Just 
lead 
the 
team,” 

Speight told his teammate. 
“Do what you do.”

So 
O’Korn 
went 
out 

and put on a show, giving 
Michigan it’s first Big Ten 
win of the season.

Five Things We Learned: ‘M’ proves it can close out games

There’s no debate. Over the 

past few seasons, Michigan 
has struggled to finish off 
opponents. Devastating losses 
to Michigan State, Iowa, Ohio 
State and Florida State have all 
come because the Wolverines 
weren’t able to hold onto a late 
lead.

Purdue may not be on the 

level of any of those teams. But 
Jim Harbaugh still believes he 
may have learned a valuable 
lesson about this team: it can 
close out games.

“They can win in the late 

rounds,” Harbaugh said after 
Saturday’s 28-10 win over the 

Boilermakers. “That’s a great 
thing to learn about your ball 
club. You never know quite 
what the character is of the 
team, and things get tough. A 
lot of people start (looking) for 
alternatives. Our guys dug deep 
and finished them off.”

Here are five (other) things 

we learned from the win: 

1. Offensive line struggles

Michigan’s 
issues 
in 

pass protection were made 
painstakingly clear Saturday. 
Purdue entered the game with 
one sack on the season and left 
it having sacked Wilton Speight 
and John O’Korn four times.

There may not have been 

a more sobering image than 
Speight lying motionless on 
the turf after one particularly 
nasty hit in the first quarter. 
Quite simply, Michigan needs 
to do a better job of protecting 
its quarterbacks.

The Wolverines didn’t find 

success running the ball until 
late in the game either, and 
even then, they finished with 
just 139 yards on 44 carries. All 
in all, it was a fairly pedestrian 
day for the offensive line.

2. Michigan’s corners have 
been better than expected

Cornerbacks 
coach 
Mike 

Zordich’s candid — and blunt 
— remarks earlier this summer 
about his position group seem to 
have worked. The Boilermakers 
scuffled to 159 passing yards on 
30 attempts — completing just 
43 percent of their passes — and 
a large chunk of those yards 
came on gimmick plays such 
as a wide receiver pass, tunnel 
screens and throwbacks.

Purdue was unable to find 

any success when it tested 
Michigan 
downfield, 
as 

sophomore cornerbacks David 
Long and Lavert Hill had 
fantastic 
days 
in 
coverage. 

Long, in particular, stood out; 
he 
had 
several 
impressive 

plays where he was in perfect 
position.

This was a position group 

that many pointed to as a 
possible weakness before the 
season 
started. 
Saturday’s 

performance was yet another 
sign that the corners are in 
lockstep with the rest of the 
defense, which now ranks No. 1 
in the nation with an average of 
203.3 yards allowed per game.

3. Replacing Tarik Black 

may require more than one 

player

Led 
by 
John 
O’Korn, 

Michigan aired the ball out 
against 
Purdue’s 
secondary, 

throwing for 284 yards — on 9.2 
yards per attempt — with one 
touchdown, a 12-yard catch-
and-run to redshirt sophomore 
tight end Zach Gentry in the 

first quarter. Gentry had three 
catches for 48 yards on the day; 
his battery mate, sophomore 
tight end Sean McKeon, led the 
team with five catches for 82 
yards.

Neither 
possesses 
the 

same type of ability as Black, 
Michigan’s 
second-leading 

receiver on the season who may 
miss the rest of the year with 
a broken foot. Yet both — in 
addition to junior receiver Grant 
Perry and redshirt freshman 
receiver Nate Schoenle, who 
tallied a combined 5 catches for 
68 yards — made up just fine for 
Black’s absence Saturday.

Michigan may not have a 

single player on the roster 
who can currently replicate 
Black’s skillset. Until it finds an 
individual who can, it’ll take a 
group effort to do so.

4. Chris Evans isn’t going 

away

It would’ve been easy to 

count 
out 
the 
sophomore 

running back after the first 
three games of the year. After 
all, he had lost his starting job 

after only one game, and his 
replacement, fifth-year senior 
Ty Isaac, had rushed for an 
impressive 336 yards entering 
Saturday.

But Isaac, who left last 

week’s game injured, looked 
ineffective 
against 
Purdue, 

taking 10 carries for just 20 
yards 
while 
struggling 
in 

pass protection. Junior Karan 
Higdon didn’t do much better, 
rushing for 31 yards on 10 
carries and fumbling on a 
screen pass.

So Evans took advantage. 

He received the most carries 
and was the most productive 
back, running 14 times for 97 
yards with two touchdowns. 
His late 49-yard touchdown 
scamper was an exclamation 
point on what was an excellent 
day, his best of the season, and 
showed that Evans definitely 
has more to say when it comes 
to the ongoing competition for 
carries.

5. BOLD PREDICTION: 

John O’Korn has reopened 

the quarterback competition

Harbaugh 
said 
after 
the 

game 
that 
he 
thinks 
the 

injury 
Speight 
suffered 
is 

a “soft tissue” problem and 
not anything structural; his 
status going forward, though, 
remains unclear. But even if 
Speight returns quickly, O’Korn 
may have done well enough 
Saturday to earn more snaps. 
When Harbaugh was asked 
whether O’Korn’s performance 
warranted another look at the 
quarterback competition, he 
appeared to laugh it off. Yet his 
answer — though a deflection — 
was still telling.

“He played great,” Harbaugh 

said. “He really did. John 
played a heck of a ball game, 
and we’re happy for him. Like 
I said before, thought he came 
into the game seeing things 
really well right off the bat.”

In the season opener against 

Florida, Harbaugh elected to 
insert O’Korn into the game 
to give Speight a chance to 
calm 
down 
after 
throwing 

two 
consecutive 
pick-sixes. 

After Saturday, it may not take 
that much going forward for 
Harbaugh to play O’Korn.

Sophomore running back Chris Evans led Michigan’s backfield with 14 carries, 97 yards and two touchdowns.

Take a knee

M

y job is to write about 
Michigan sports, but my 
identity is as an African-

American woman.

After a week in which my own 

University saw racist messages 
written on residence hall doors and 
yelled at a 
rally outside 
the Union, 
the President 
of the United 
States spent 
the weekend 
criticizing 
NFL players 
for exercising 
their First 
Amendment 
right to kneel 
during the National Anthem. He 
called out NBA players in a separate 
yet similar fashion, but I’m going to 
focus on the NFL for now because, 
at this pace, these bi-weekly 
columns could become an ongoing 
series on the social issues raised by 
sports. 

Today, the country’s focus 

turned to race and the hidden 
politics of identity.

It’s a concept that has been 

ignored at every turn. While sports 
are held up as a gold standard — a 
setting where people from every 
spectrum of society can come 
together for a few hours and share 
in the experience of a melting pot 
of emotions — there is a darker 
undercurrent inherent to their 
reverence in this country.

Between the white lines, players 

are seen as a collective, showered 
by a single spotlight. As long as the 
players are wearing uniforms that 
match those of the fans cheering 
for them from the stands or their 
couches, they are all part of the 
same team.

All of their successes are 

celebrated, and all of their failures 
are mourned. Together.

That tradition of unity is 

strongest before the whistle is even 
blown. When the National Anthem 
is played or performed, a chorus of 
people stand as one to honor the 

country they love and the citizens 
who risk their lives to protect it.

That’s why when Colin 

Kaepernick decided to take a knee 
last year — to take a stand against 
social injustice — the chorus of 
voices began to split. Some praised 
his name while others defaced 
it. Some understood his message 
while others distorted it. Some 
followed his lead while others 
rebuked it. 

Kaepernick, now unemployed 

by the NFL, put his job on the line 
because he put his identity first. 
In the realm of sports, that’s a 
controversial stance. It shouldn’t be.

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 

has become a vocal advocate of 
his former quarterback, and he 
maintained that role Saturday at 
Purdue. Asked if he agreed with the 
President’s stance, Harbaugh made 
his position explicitly clear.

“No, I don’t agree with the 

President,” Harbaugh said. 

“That’s ridiculous. Check the 
Constitution.”

The First Amendment explicitly 

gives all U.S. citizens the right to 
freedom of speech and the right to 
peaceful assembly. The backlash 
facing Kaepernick shows that both 
of those rights have come under 
heavy fire.

In choosing to focus public 

discourse on a problem that has 
plagued the country since long 
before the current president took 
office, Kaepernick has pushed 
himself and his fellow NFL players 
into uncharted waters.

They have had a tough decision 

to make every Sunday since he 
first touched his knee to the turf. 
Kaepernick made his a year ago, 
and he no longer has a job because 
of it. Now, his colleagues have to 
decide whether or not they should 
stand with him by kneeling as well.

According to the President, NFL 

players who want the “privilege” of 

making millions of dollars should 
stand for the National Anthem. 
Otherwise, the owners should 
employ his signature line to take 
away said privilege.

The NFL is a majority African-

American league. For the President 
to call NFL players who are 
protesting injustices toward their 
social group “sons of b------,” while 
deeming the participants of the alt-
right rally in Charlottesville “very 
fine people,” speaks volumes about 
race and society in this day and age.

Athletes are seen as entertainers, 

and fans give them a stage to put on 
a show. In exchange for the ability 
to play a sport for a living, athletes 
are seen as beholden to the desires 
of the consumers who spend their 
hard-earned money to support 
them. They are told to be grateful 
for what they have, and are seen 
as spoiled when they voice their 
discontent.

The owners — whose 

multibillion-dollar empires are 
also sustained by these consumers 
— are in the same boat, but they 
notably don’t face the same wave 
of criticism. It’s just as notable that 
not one owner is Black.

The argument that athletes 

should stick to sports is not only 
detrimental for its demeaning 
nature. Its underlying notion 
devalues athletes as individuals, 
deeming them undeserving of the 
ability to speak their minds about 
issues pertinent to their lives. Their 
identity off the field is determined 
to be irrelevant.

So on Sunday, in response to the 

President’s comments, many NFL 
players brought their identity with 
them on the field.

Dozens of athletes from teams 

across the country knelt in silent 
protest, while three entire teams 
decided to stay in their locker 
rooms during the anthem. Many 
owners defended their players in 

official press releases, and some 
even took the field to participate in 
protests alongside their teams.

While that could be a sign of 

progress, photos spread on social 
media told an alternate tale. Of the 
players choosing to take a knee, not 
many were White. And Kaepernick 
is still nowhere to be seen on a 
football sideline.

In the press box at Purdue’s Ross-

Ade Stadium, my fellow football 
beat writers and I happened to still 
be sitting as the National Anthem 
was set to begin. Another media 
member looked at us and asked if 
we were pulling a Kaepernick. 

We weren’t, and as we hurried 

to stand up, I hesitated for a split 
second. I could have kept sitting, or 
even kneeled myself. All I would be 
risking is disconcerting looks from 
media members who I likely won’t 
ever see again after graduation.

My job at a student-run college 

newspaper is safe, but I stood up 
anyway. Every time I have since 
Kaepernick lost his job, I’d be lying 
if I said I didn’t feel conflicted about 
it.

The National Anthem is a 

fundamental tradition of our 
country, and I would prefer if 
everyone stood and saluted the 
American flag. But taking a knee 
now means that inequality in our 
society is a serious issue that needs 
to be addressed, and that is a cause 
I wholeheartedly support.

The First Amendment is a 

fundamental element of our 
country as well, and Kaepernick 
should not have been punished for 
exercising his.

Kaepernick started a 

conversation about the intrinsic 
link between race and sports. After 
the President’s pointed remarks, 
that conversation has reached a 
tipping point, and two clear sides 
have emerged.

Take a stand with the President 

or take a knee with Kaepernick.

The good, bad and ugly: Purdue

If you were looking for drama 

on Saturday, West Lafayette was 
the place for you.

Trailing by three until the end 

of the third quarter, the Michigan 
football team was staring down 
the barrel at an upset in Ross-Ade 
Stadium. But behind a redemption 
story from John O’Korn that is oft 
reserved for movies, the eighth-
ranked Wolverines managed to 
pull away and not look back.

Michigan 
escaped 
Purdue 

with a conference-opening win, 
and is now entering its bye week 
undefeated with Michigan State 
as the next team on the docket.

The Daily breaks down the 

good, the bad and the ugly from 
Saturday’s game.

The good

There was a lot to like about 

the 
Wolverines’ 
road 
trip. 

O’Korn finally had his day, the 
defense had yet another standout 
performance 
and 
Michigan’s 

tight ends — redshirt sophomore 
Zach Gentry and sophomore 
Sean 
McKeon 
— 
solidified 

themselves as reliable options in 
the Wolverine passing attack.

Michigan’s 
fifth-year 
senior 

quarterback seized his moment 
after being thrust into a tense game 
following Wilton Speight’s exit. 
He was perfect on his first drive, 
completing all five of his passes for 
61 yards before finding Gentry for 
a touchdown, and ended the game 
with 270 yards and a touchdown 
on 18-of-26 passing. He did have 
an interception, but it was more so 
the product of an unlucky bounce 
on a catchable ball than a poor 
decision.

More than anything, O’Korn 

helped the Wolverines exorcise 
their demons in the red zone — 
converting on every trip — and 
he connected on a number of 
difficult throws throughout the 
matchup with the Boilermakers. 
Speight, on the other hand, 
entered the matchup 1-of-17 in the 
red zone.

Gentry and McKeon proved to 

be O’Korn’s fail-safes, as the duo 
finished as Michigan’s top two 

receivers. McKeon finished with 
five catches for 82 yards, while 
Gentry recorded three catches for 
48 yards and the Wolverines’ lone 
receiving touchdown.

There were concerns about 

who would replace freshman 
wide 
receiver 
Tarik 
Black’s 

production, but McKeon and 
Gentry left the Michigan faithful 
with a sense of relief for now.

And of course, Michigan’s 

stout defensive unit had another 
hallmark day. Purdue — an 
offense brimming with trickery 
— managed to score 10 points in 
the first half while racking up 179 
yards, but the Wolverines held 
the Boilermakers scoreless with 
just 10 yards in the second half.

The performance catapulted 

Michigan to the top of the team 
defense rankings, as the unit is 
surrendering an average of 203.3 
yards per game.

Not 
to 
be 
overlooked, 

sophomore 
running 
back 

Chris Evans finally had the 
performance that many were 
waiting for. He finished the game 
with two touchdowns and 97 
yards, highlighted by a 49-yard 
touchdown run in the fourth 
quarter that effectively ended the 
contest for good.

The bad

Michigan 
is 
beginning 
to 

show an affinity for turning the 
ball over, as the Wolverines have 
forfeited possession seven times 
through four games.

With just under 10 minutes 

remaining in the third quarter, 
O’Korn completed a pass to 
sophomore running back Karan 
Higdon for an 11-yard gain.

The 
positive 
yardage 
was 

canceled 
out, 
however, 
by 

Higdon’s 
ensuing 
fumble. 

Linebacker Danny Ezechukwu 
recovered the ball at Purdue’s 
37-yard 
line. 
Though 
the 

Boilermakers 
didn’t 
manage 

to capitalize on the mistake — 
Purdue went three-and-out — it 
was still a dangerous moment 
given that the Wolverines trailed, 
10-7, at the time.

The fumble opened up the door 

for Evans’ breakout performance, 
however, as Higdon did not 

receive a carry for the rest of the 
game.

The second turnover came 

earlier in the game, with just over 
eight minutes remaining in the 
second quarter. O’Korn’s pass to 
junior wide receiver Grant Perry 
was picked off by Navon Mosley 
and returned seven yards to 
Michigan’s 27-yard line.

The Wolverines’ defense bailed 

them out, though, forcing Purdue 
to settle for a field goal. Again, 
the interception was not really 
O’Korn’s fault, as it bounced off 
Perry’s hands.

Still, while no team has been 

able to truly make Michigan pay 
for turning the ball over, that can 
only last so long.

The ugly

It didn’t take long for Michigan 

to hit a low point against Purdue. 
Midway through the first quarter, 
redshirt 
junior 
quarterback 

Wilton Speight was sacked by 
linebacker Markus Bailey for an 
11-yard loss before absorbing a 
second hit that crunched his neck 
and ended his day.

It was a scary moment in 

West Lafayette, as Speight laid 
motionless on the ground before 
gingerly walking off the field with 
the help of trainers.

He needed to leave the field to 

receive X-rays and never returned 
to the game.

While there is no official 

diagnosis, Jim Harbaugh said 
after the game that he believes it 
to be a “soft-tissue” injury.

There is still no timetable for 

Speight’s return, but O’Korn’s 
performance begged the question 
of whether or not a fresh 
quarterback competition would 
be opened.

Harbaugh did not answer the 

question directly, but he did give 
O’Korn the credit he was due.

“I thought John really played 

great,” Harbaugh said. “He was 
seeing things really good from the 
time he came into the ballgame. 
He ran the offense well, made 
the big plays. The throw he hit 
Gentry on the seam route down 
the middle was a big-time throw. 
And he had others. Really proud 
of him. Proud of the whole team.”

Cerda keys Michigan to needed victory

Entering Sunday afternoon’s 

contest against Northwestern 
(0-4-0 Big Ten, 2-7-0 overall), 
the No. 22 Michigan men’s 
soccer team had been held 
scoreless with no shots on 
goal in its past two games. As 
a result, the Wolverines went 
0-2-1, halting the momentum 
they had gained early in the 
season.

Just 
under 
six 
minutes 

into the first half against the 
Wildcats, 
Michigan 
(2-1-1, 

5-2-2) had already registered 
one shot on goal, but was still 
unable to convert set pieces 
and scoring chances against 
a 
struggling 
Northwestern 

defense 
— 
it 
had 
been 

outscored, 10-1, in the first half 
and outshot, 98-74, this season.

In the 16th minute, yet 

another 
Wolverine 
chance 

went 
by 
the 
wayside, 
as 

sophomore 
midfielder 
Jack 

Hallahan’s through ball sailed 
past the outstretched foot of 
freshman 
midfielder 
Marc 

Ybarra and trickled out of 
bounds.

After groans from the crowd 

subsided, midfielder Ivo Cerda 
stared 
at 
his 
teammates, 

clapped his hands fervently 
and shouted, “Keep it going!”

The junior captain lived 

by his mantra, setting the 
example for his teammates to 
follow. Fifteen minutes later, 
Cerda’s header into the top-left 
corner of the goal off another 
Hallahan cross from the right 
flank put the Wolverines on 
the board and, ultimately, back 
in the win column with a 3-1 
victory.

Though the goal — Cerda’s 

second this season — helped 
the 
Santiago, 
Chile 
native 

further his poise the rest of the 
game, it was more about using 
the goal as inspiration for his 
teammates.

“Every player would like to 

score early,” Cerda said. “It’s 

easy then to play, but I always 
try to rub that confidence 
off and motivation onto my 
teammates, 
especially 
after 

scoring a goal.”

In 
his 
newly-established 

role as one of the team’s three 
captains, Cerda 
blends 
self-

confidence 
and work ethic 
to be a model 
for the players 
around him.

“(They 

should) try to 
stay 
focused, 

try 
to 
keep 

a 
high 
line,” 

Cerda 
said. 

“They all knew 
what this game meant to us. 
It was a turning point for 
our season, we hoped to get a 
win today so we can get back 
on a winning streak. There’s 
so much to say: they’re all 
focused, but I just try to keep 

them motivated.”

After a red card to junior 

forward 
Francis 
Atuahene 

left Michigan fielding just 10 
players for the end of the first 
and the entire second half, it 
was the workhorse Cerda who 

stepped up once 
again with a man 
down.

“He’s 
done 

really well,” said 
Michigan coach 
Chaka 
Daley. 

“He’s 
been 

asked to play in 
many 
different 

positions 
as 
a 

result of having 
a little bit of an 
injury to start 

the year and having to wean 
him into our team. He and 
(Ybarra) are probably the two 
fittest guys on the team. All of 
the hard work they do — and all 
the hard work the team does — 
is the difference.”

Added Cerda: “I felt that, 

at 
moments, 
you 
would 

imagine they had 10 men. We 
were looking good, keeping 
possession. … That’s because 
we trusted what we do, we don’t 
get scared by any pressure like 
this. We’re prepared to be a 
man down and we were lucky 
enough to get a 2-0 lead.”

After defenseman Jackson 

Ragen scored in the 55th 
minute to put the Wolverines 
up 2-0, it was Cerda who was 
first to sprint to the freshman 
with a big hug.

It was Cerda who, as the 

final whistle blew, breathed a 
sigh of relief, displayed a wide 
grin and threw his hands up 
in the air as if he was Rocky 
winning a 10-round fight.

And 
it 
was 
Cerda 
who 

motioned his teammates to run 
over to the Michigan Ultras, 
waved at fans to stay and not 
head for the exits, and started 
to sing “Hail to the Victors.”

‘M’ tops Northwestern

Last year’s match between 

Michigan and Northwestern 
epitomized 
the 
Wolverines’ 

2016 season.

The Michigan men’s soccer 

team outshot the Wildcats 23-13 
but fell in a double-overtime 
heartbreaker – a capsule of 
what was frequently described 
by coach Chaka Daley as “balls 
not bouncing the right way.”

But on Sunday at U-M Soccer 

Stadium, things broke more 
in No. 22 Michigan’s favor – 
as they have for much of this 
season. The Wolverines (2-1-
1 Big Ten, 5-2-2 overall) beat 
Northwestern (0-4-0, 2-7-0) 3-1 
to exceed their win total from 
last year.

“It means a lot, it’s definitely 

a special season for us,” said 
junior midfielder Ivo Cerda. 
“We don’t like to talk a lot about 
last year, but it’s definitely 
important to get back in the 
winning race. We come from 
two really tough losses, but I 
think this team has a lot in store 
and it’s important for us to get a 
win today.”

After an uneventful start 

to the match, the Wolverines 
broke through in the 31st 
minute. 
Sophomore 
forward 

Jack Hallahan sent a soaring 
free kick into the box that met 
the head of Cerda, deflecting 
into the top left corner past the 
goalkeeper’s reach.

But almost as quickly as the 

score came, Michigan would 
lose a man for the rest of the 
afternoon.

Just seven seconds after his 

substitution, 
junior 
forward 

Francis Atuahene received a 
red card after he got too much 
of a Northwestern player on a 
challenge.

It was a tough break for the 

Wolverines’ 2016 leading scorer, 
who has battled injuries and 
found the back of the net only 

once in the young season.

Michigan would add to its 

lead off another set piece to 
open the second half – this time 
off a corner kick from junior 
defender 
Marcello 
Borges 

that met the head of freshman 
midfielder Jackson Regan for 
his first career goal.

As displayed by both of those 

conversions, Daley sees these 
set pieces as an asset.

“It’s something you obviously 

want to get sharper with,” 
Daley said. “When you look at 
the run of the game, most games 
concede within the 18-yard box 
or set plays. Certainly, to put 
yourself in a position where 
we’re competitive I think is 
important.”

A 10-man formation wouldn’t 

hurt the Wolverines until the 
65th minute, when a free-
running Sean Lynch connected 
from the right flank to cut the 
lead in half.

Northwestern 
continued 

to pressure in an attempt to 
equalize, sending four shots 
on goal in the final 15 minutes. 
Sophomore goalkeeper Andrew 
Verdi, however, was aggressive 
in knocking away attempts near 
his net. 

The 
Wildcats 
nearly 

equalized off a free kick via a 
yellow card in the 90th minute 
– Michigan’s fifth of the day 
– but the Wolverines would 
instead seal the victory thanks 
to Jack Hallahan’s open-net 
conversion.

“If we can control our own 

destiny and stay within the 
top half of our league – this 
win was huge for that,” Daley 
said. “To be down a player and 
have to grind it out for 60-70 
minutes is phenomenal. I’m so 
proud of our guys and what they 
accomplished.”

Northwestern 
outshot 

Michigan, but balls bounced the 
Wolverines’ way.

What a difference a year 

makes.

O’Korn jumps on chance to rewrite story

W

EST LAFAYETTE — 
This isn’t the pretti-
est offense.

There are dropped passes. 

There are blown-up running 
plays. There are botched pass 
protections 
that end 
with 
Michigan’s 
starting 
quarterback 
lying 
motionless 
on the 
turf, badly 
injured, 
before 
he walks 
slowly and gingerly off the field 
towards an unknown fate and 
further medical testing.

Consistency — that’s also 

been missing.

Through the first three 

weeks, issues arose in the red 
zone, where the Wolverines 
scored only one touchdown in 
10 trips. Michigan was 3-of-3 
inside Purdue’s 20-yard line on 
Saturday.

Against Florida, the 

Wolverines ran the ball 49 
times for 215 yards. Michigan 
could muster just 139 yards 
on 44 carries against the 
Boilermakers.

And the big plays — even 

those don’t always come easy.

Perhaps the best example 

came with 6:32 left in the third 
quarter. It was 3rd-and-6, and 
Michigan trailed by three. The 
call was a pass. Purdue entered 
the backfield quickly, and the 
play appeared to be dead in the 
water.

John O’Korn had a different 

idea. He spun out of a near-
certain sack, rolled to his right, 
waited patiently and delivered a 
pass to Grant Perry for a crucial 
12-yard gain.

Led by their fifth-year 

senior backup quarterback, the 
Wolverines would march down 
the field that drive and take a 

lead they never surrendered.

“He played great,” said 

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh. 
“He really did. John played a 
heck of a ball game, and we’re 
happy for him. Like I said 
before, thought he came into the 
game seeing things really well 
right off the bat.”

Added sophomore tight end 

Sean McKeon: “(O’Korn) was 
definitely confident. He just 
wanted to do a good job — do 
his job. Make it seem like he 
had confidence in us, and we 
wanted to help him out in any 
way we could. Really got the 
offense going and he did a great 
job today.

“Definitely very proud of him, 

happy for him. He got his shot; 
he made the most of it.”

After a bruising and uneven 

28-10 win, we still don’t know 
much about the identity of 
Michigan’s offense. We do 
know, however, what John 
O’Korn has become — a 
dependable backup whose 
performance in relief of Speight 
may have just reopened the 
quarterback competition.

O’Korn has taken criticism 

in the past for his struggles 
to master the unknown — an 
inability to deal with pressure 
both on and off the field. In 
the summer, he spoke frankly 
about losing his confidence after 
being replaced as the starter 
at Houston. He felt like the 
scapegoat for things that were 
outside of his control; coming 
under that much scrutiny as an 
18-year-old, he admitted, shook 
him. It took a transfer across the 
country, two years and a new 
coach in Pep Hamilton to get 
back what he had lost.

That showed in his play, 

especially in a start last year 
against Indiana — the one 
other time O’Korn has played 
extensively in place of an 
injured Speight. Against the 
Hoosiers, amidst a blizzard, 
O’Korn looked constantly 

harassed — even when he 
wasn’t. He never seemed 
comfortable in the pocket, and 
completed just 7-of-16 passes for 
59 yards.

That game stuck out to him, 

even nearly a year later, for 
what it represented: a missed 
opportunity.

“More than anything, I 

would’ve liked to get a few 
throws back from that game,” 
O’Korn said in August. “… I 
think maybe I pressed a little 
too much, tried to make the big 
play a little too much instead of 
just letting things come to me.”

That was why Saturday’s 

game, during which he 
completed 18-of-26 passes for 
270 yards and one touchdown, 
meant so much to him. He didn’t 
press. He didn’t always try to 

make the big play. He let the 
game come to him. Doing so 
gave him a chance to rewrite the 
book on John O’Korn. It gave 
him a chance to revisit his past 
history — both at Michigan and 
at Houston.

“We all believed in John,” 

said redshirt sophomore tight 
end Zach Gentry, “and I think 
that we were able to buck up 
and rally the troops and get it 
done.”

After his 12-yard touchdown 

pass in the first quarter, O’Korn 
turned and let loose at the 
opposing sideline. He wasn’t 
just yelling in excitement. Later, 
he admitted he was yelling at 
Purdue co-offensive coordinator 
Tony Levine, his former coach 
at Houston.

“I’m human,” O’Korn said. 

“Anytime you get to go out and 
beat your former coach — it was 
his decision to bench me in the 
first place — it’s gonna be an 
emotional night.”

Once the game ended, 

O’Korn lingered on the field 
for the customary post-game 
TV interviews. He answered 
questions with a grin on his 
face, hands on his hips, looking 
happy. When it was over, he 
jogged off to join his teammates.

It’s a path he’s taken plenty of 

times before, at both Houston 
and Michigan. But this time, he 
ran off alone. He was under the 
spotlight, and deservedly so. 
The remaining Michigan fans 
watched as he approached their 
corner of the bleachers. They 
cheered loudly, chanting his 
name in unison.

It may have seemed unlikely 

before the season that John 
O’Korn would have found a 
career’s worth of closure on a 
sweltering Saturday afternoon 
in West Lafayette. And yet, 
that’s exactly what happened.

“It’s been a journey — there’s 

no secret it’s been tough,” 
O’Korn said. “I talked about 
it in camp. The culmination 
of all those things, it was an 
emotional night for me. The 
biggest thing, I’m just happy 
that I can contribute to a great 
win on the road. Beat the 
elements, beat the team in their 
own house and have a happy 
flight home.”

Fifth-year senior quarterback John O’Korn had a moment of redemption in West Lafayette on Saturday, leading the Wolverines to a victory over Purdue.

Gentry shines against Boilermakers

WEST 
LAFAYETTE 
— 

Zach Gentry trotted off the 
field 
at 
Ross-Ade 
Stadium, 

alone, christened by cheers of 
adoration.

He 
reached 
the 
corner 

of the end zone — the same 
corner in which he scored 
what was arguably Michigan’s 
most important touchdown of 
the game. Fans pleaded with 
him, desperate for a piece of 
game-worn Michigan football 
memorabilia.

The 
redshirt 
sophomore 

obliged, removing one of his 
gloves and tossing into the first 
row. It landed in a teenage girl’s 
possession, and she instantly 
fitted it to her left hand — a 
perfect accessory to the maize 
Michigan shirt that she was 
already 
wearing. 
Then 
she 

pulled out her iPhone, held 
the glove next to her face, and 
flashed a smile for the camera.

One day ago, his glove and 

her photo wouldn’t have meant 
much. Frankly, the recipient of 
Gentry’s glove might have had 
no idea who he was at all, if not 
for the name on the back of his 
jersey.

On 
Saturday, 
that 
all 

changed.

Gentry put forth a breakout 

performance in a game that the 
Wolverines may have needed it 
more than ever. He wasn’t the 
only tight end to star in West 
Lafayette, as sophomore Sean 
McKeon led all receivers with 
five catches for 82 yards. Gentry 
himself tallied three catches for 
48 yards with Michigan’s lone 
receiving touchdown.

But when redshirt junior 

quarterback 
Wilton 
Speight 

went down midway through the 
first quarter with an injury that 
ended his day, fifth-year senior 
John O’Korn needed someone 
to lean on.

Lucky for him, Gentry didn’t 

wait to oblige.

With just under 12 minutes 

left in the second quarter, the 
Wolverines found themselves 
in the red zone on O’Korn’s 
opening 
drive. 
After 
two 

straight carries by fifth-year 
senior Ty Isaac, Michigan was 
facing a 3rd-and-4 on Purdue’s 
12-yard line.

For a different team, at a 

different time, a field goal in 
the second quarter may have 
been easier to stomach. With a 
backup quarterback, coming off 
a game in which four red zone 
trips ended with no touchdowns 
to show for it, it meant a whole 
lot more.

O’Korn 
took 
the 
snap. 

Gentry shed a lineman before 
streaking, wide open, across the 
10-yard line on a crossing route. 
O’Korn made the simple play, 
dumping it to his tight end.

The rest was up to Gentry. He 

had one man to beat to the pylon, 
and he did, diving into the end 
zone for the first touchdown of 
his collegiate career.

“We saw the specific defense 

they were in, and Coach (Pep 
Hamilton) and Coach (Tim 
Drevno) made a good play call,” 
Gentry said. “Luckily it popped 
open, and I’m excited about it. 
Felt good to get the first one out 
of the way.”

There 
was 
no 
grand 

celebration — just a quick point 

to the cameras before flipping 
the ball to the ref. It looked like 
it was all business, a surprising 
fact for a man who converted to 
the position just roughly two 
years ago, around the time that 
Michigan was preparing to face 
Florida in the Citrus Bowl.

Gentry may have once been a 

coveted quarterback prospect, 
but on Saturday, he finally had 
a performance that looked like 
the culmination of years of 
work — complete with the big 
plays that helped Michigan 
avoid what once looked like a 
disastrous fate.

“It’s something that takes 

time,” he said. “I’ve been able 
to go out and execute and (the 
coaches have) been helping me 
out a lot with that.”

His second highlight came in 

the fourth quarter. Freshman 
wide 
receiver 
Donovan 

Peoples-Jones was flagged for 
an illegal block. What would 
have been 2nd-and-11 on the 
Purdue 16-yard line turned into 
1st-and-25 on the Boilermakers’ 
31.

The Wolverines may have led 

by four, but that wasn’t quite 
comfortable enough.

Gentry made his mark again, 

single-handedly 
cancelling 

out the penalty by contorting 
his body on the next play to 
register a 25-yard reception 
down the seam and record 
what may have been the most 
impressive quarterback-receiver 
connection of Michigan’s young 
season.

O’Korn put the ball in a 

place that only Gentry could 
catch it. And Gentry rewarded 
his quarterback for it. Even he 
couldn’t quite put the play into 
words.

“I don’t know,” Gentry said. 

“I just looked straight up and 
(O’Korn) threw a good back 
shoulder ball, and I was able to 
adjust to it successfully. And it 
was actually a good ball cause 
there was a guy inside me.”

Three catches may seem 

pedestrian, but not for Gentry.

It has been a long path to 

Saturday night, but he finally 
had his moment.

As for the glove, well, some 

teenager is going to have quite 
the story to tell tomorrow 
morning. And she definitely 
won’t have to explain who Zach 
Gentry is anymore.

Redshirt sophomore tight end Zach Gentry scored Michigan’s lone passing touchdown against the Boilermakers.

The troubling state
of the offensive line
W

EST LAFAYETTE — 
Two quarterbacks took 
the field for Michigan 

on Saturday. One got knocked out 
of the game 
in the first 
quarter, 
while the 
other led the 
Wolverines 
to a 28-10 
victory.

At first 

glance it 
might seem 
like their 
days were 
polar opposites, but both redshirt 
junior quarterback Wilton Speight 
and fifth-year senior John O’Korn 
shared a common thread against 
Purdue. They were let down by 
their offensive line.

Speight dropped back to pass, 

and all he could see was black.

The Boilermaker defensive line 

collapsed on him in seconds, and 
Speight was on the ground. But 
that wasn’t the worst hit he took on 
the day.

Moments later, another defender 

rammed into him from behind, and 
it took Speight a long time to get up.

The trainers helped him to his 

feet and Speight walked off under 
his own power, but clearly hurt, he 
never returned to the field.

The game was still tied at zero, 

and there were still 50 minutes left 
to be played.

Near the halfway point of the 

third quarter — with Michigan 
down 10-7 — a sequel was almost 
greenlit.

But just as films would bomb at 

the box office if they stuck to the 
same script, the Wolverines would 
have suffered a similar fate if they 
didn’t add a new twist to either the 
characters or the storyline.

O’Korn dropped back to pass, 

and all he could see was black.

Purdue broke through the 

offensive line and swarmed 
O’Korn. He maneuvered in and out 
of harm’s way, managing to stay 
on his feet long enough to convert 
a 3rd-and-6 pass. They went on to 
score a touchdown on that drive to 

retake the lead, and they never fell 
behind again.

In this case, the storyline didn’t 

change. Despite coming away with 
a win, that could be a disconcerting 
trend for Michigan.

For a unit whose central purpose 

is to protect the quarterback, the 
Wolverines’ offensive line put forth 
an underwhelming performance.

Purdue came into Saturday’s 

game with only one sack. The 
Boilermakers left it with four 
more, totaling 28 yards in losses. 
They also tallied four other 
tackles-for-loss, forced a fumble 
and intercepted a pass on the day, 
and that’s only in the metrics that 
statisticians keep track of.

Based on the eye test, both 

Speight and O’Korn were hassled, 
hurried and harassed by Purdue, 
and the Wolverines’ offensive line 
couldn’t stand its ground.

This isn’t a new issue for 

Michigan. After losing three of its 
five starters from a season ago, it 
was expected that they would need 
time to develop a rhythm as a unit.

But as the Big Ten opener 

showed, conference play won’t 
afford them many opportunities 
to work out the kinks. The 
Boilermakers presented a serious 
threat because they outmuscled the 
Wolverines at the line of scrimmage 
from the outset.

The offensive line’s one bright 

moment Saturday came on the 
same drive in which O’Korn 
escaped to find Grant Perry. Set 
up just shy of the end zone at the 
10-yard line, Michigan had Purdue 
on its heels. Running back Chris 
Evans lined up behind O’Korn, and 
it looked like a run play was coming.

It didn’t matter if the 

Boilermaker defense picked up on 
it. The line moved them out of the 
way entirely, and Evans trotted into 
the end zone untouched for his first 
touchdown of the year.

That’s an encouraging sign that 

the Wolverines will need to build 
on as they progress through the Big 
Ten season.

If they don’t, Michigan’s 

quarterbacks could spend a lot of 
time lying on their backs.
