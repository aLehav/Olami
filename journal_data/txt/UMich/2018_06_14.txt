DOJ supports free speech 
lawsuit against University

Trump 

administration 
attacks U-M 
speech code

By GRACE KAY

Summer Managing News Editor

The Department of Justice joined 

Speech First Monday in challenging 
the University of Michigan’s free 
speech code. In a 25-page statement of 
interest, the DOJ concludes the lawsuit 
is likely to succeed on the merits of the 
Bias Response Policy violating the First 
and 14th Amendments.

The DOJ’s statement of interest 

follows a May 8 lawsuit filed by 
Speech First, a national organization 
of students, citizens and alumni 
advocating free speech on college 
campuses. Speech First claims a bias 
response team that can mete out 
discipline and a vague speech code 
create a hazardous environment for 
free speech.

In an interview with Speech First 

President Nicole Neily in May, she said 
the organization is filing the injunction 
against the University based on three 
main factors.

“We have multiple members of the 

organization at the University,” Neily 
said. “The University of Michigan 
also has a combination of a very bad 
speech code that is very vague, a very 
active Bias Response Team that is very 
proud of its achievements because 
it keeps a log and we have numbers 
there, though not all were listed in 
the complaint. These were the three 
things we needed.”

In the statement of interest, the DOJ 

questioned not only the University’s 
speech code but the very U-M 
atmosphere.

“The University of Michigan 

(“University”) 
proclaims 
on 
its 

website that ‘[f]reedom of speech is a 
bedrock principle of [its] community 
and essential to [its] core educational 
mission as a university,’” the statement 
reads. “Unfortunately, the University 
is failing to live up to that laudable 
principle. Instead of protecting free 
speech, the University imposes a 
system of arbitrary censorship of, 

and punishment for, constitutionally 
protected speech.” 

Similarly, in the official statement 

from Speech First, Neilly argued the 
speech code has stifled the free speech 
of several members of her organization 
who attend the University. 

“Speech First has brought this 

suit to ensure that its members and 
other students at the University will 
not face investigations or discipline 
for engaging in the open and vigorous 
exchange of ideas that is at the core 
of the First Amendment merely 
because a University official or another 
student finds their views ‘demeaning,’ 
‘bothersome,’ 
‘exclusionary,’ 
or 

‘hurtful,’” Neilly writes. 

Students claim in the suit as result 

of U-M speech code they have been 
forced to refrain from speaking on 
topics like gun control, immigration, 
identity politics and abortion out of fear 
of being reported to the Bias Response 
Team. Of the students referenced in 
the lawsuit, none were named for fear 
of retaliation. 

CSG weighs in 
on PROSPER 

Big 10 schools oppose 
reformation of Higher 

Education Act

By ALICE TRACEY

Summer Daily News Editor

In collaboration with other student 

presidents of Big Ten universities, Daniel 
Greene, the University of Michigan’s 
Central Student Government president, 
released a letter Tuesday night opposing 
the Promoting Real Opportunity, Success 
and 
Prosperity 
through 
Education 

Reform Act.

Proposed 
by 
U.S. 
House 
of 

Representatives Republicans in 2017, the 
PROSPER Act aims to reform the Higher 
Education Act by simplifying federal aid 
for higher education.

According to the website of the 

Committee 
on 
Education 
and 
the 

Workforce, 
the 
legislation 
would 

streamline student aid by combining 
all current federal loan options into the 
ONE Loan program and offering a single 
repayment option. While the PROSPER 
Act would expand the Pell Grant program, 
it would cut Supplemental Educational 
Opportunity Grants, which assist the 
country’s lowest-income students. The 
PROSPER Act would also limit TRIO 
programs — sources of aid for students 
from disadvantaged backgrounds — and 
Public Service Loan Forgiveness.

Tuesday’s letter, addressed to Paul 

Ryan, speaker of the House, House 
Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, House 
Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and House 
Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, expresses 
Big Ten student presidents’ dissatisfaction 
with the extent to which the PROSPER 
Act would slash federal programs. 
Similar letters of opposition have been 
released since U.S. House Republicans 
proposed the PROSPER Act. In an 
email interview with The Daily, 
Greene wrote he signed the Big Ten 
letter because the PROSPER Act 
threatens college affordability.

Lawsuit challenges 
sexual assault policy

Student sues U-M 
for being biased 
against males 
accused of assault

By ALICE TRACEY

Summer Daily News Editor

A lawsuit filed in U.S. District 
Court by Deborah Gordon Law on 
June 4 on behalf of a male University 
of Michigan student, claims the 
University’s 
sexual 
misconduct 
policy does not provide due process 
to males accused of sexual assault 
and thereby discriminates against 
them on the basis of gender. The 
allegation follows a complaint 
brought forth by a female student 
who approached U-M’s Office of 
Institutional Equity on March 12 
saying she and the male student had 
engaged in non-consensual sexual 
activity several months earlier. 
In April, the University sent 
out a no-contact order against the 
male student. The female student 
then claimed the male student 

violated the directive by staying 
in the same dining hall as her, and 
the University reprimanded him 
via email. According to the lawsuit, 
however, the male’s Mcard records 
prove he was not in the dining hall 
at that time.
Due to the female student’s 
accusations 
of 
assault, 
the 
University put the male student’s 
official 
transcript 
on 
hold, 
preventing 
him 
from 
starting 
graduate 
school 
until 
further 
notice. This disciplinary action 
was not warranted, the lawsuit 
says, because the University failed 
to fairly investigate the situation. 
According to the lawsuit, the 
students did have sex in his dorm 
room in November 2017 but the 
interaction was consensual and no 
alcohol or drugs were involved. The 
male student also claims the two 
stayed in touch after having sex, 
even eating together in the dining 
hall. He says the female student 
suggested having sex again, but he 
declined.

“Magic Skoolie” 
bus becomes 
unconventional art

By ZAYNA SYED

Daily Staff Reporter

After spending three weeks 
at a farm immersion program in 
Ireland, Tori Essex, a 2018 alum of 
the University of Michigan School of 
Art & Design, said she felt the most 
“clear-headed” since she was 8 years 
old. She relished the introspective 
time 
and 
human 
connections 
volunteering on the farm allowed 
her and wished she could do 
something similar after graduating. 
Her wish came true.
However, 
while 
farming 
is 
contingent 
upon 
nurturing 
a 
certain slice of land, Tori will not be 
anchored to any one farm. Instead, 
she plans to tour independent, 
organic 
farms 
throughout 
the 
country via “The Magic Skoolie,” 
a school bus she converted into a 
living space as part of her senior 
capstone project.
“I was farming for three weeks 
and I was super isolated and had 
a lot of time to think,” Essex said. 
“I was loving just being outside 
and volunteering and getting to 
know people I never would’ve met 
otherwise. I was thinking about 
how I wish that I could do that after 
I graduated, and just kind of float 
around like that a little bit. But the 

biggest risk in travelling all the time 
and volunteering and being posted 
is the living situation or the hosting 
situation, the accommodations that 
you might or might not get. So just 
for my own sense of security and 
comfort, I was like, ‘It would be 
great if I could create something 
that I could be comfortable in that I 
would be able to take with me from 
spot to spot.’”
At first, Essex thought she might 
live in a tiny house, hauling it from 
farm to farm using a truck. But 
after calculating the expenses, she 
realized it was costly and might be 
difficult to maneuver. Driving a bus 
would be much more economical 
and easy to handle, if she could 
convert one into a home.
While the idea of converting a 
school bus into a living space may 
seem niche, Essex researched the 
idea via internet and Instagram 
and discovered others had done it 
before. According to Essex’s adviser 
for the project, Rebekah Modrak, 
an associate professor at the Art & 
Design School, it even has precedent 
in movements from the ’70s.
“It has a history with the 1970s 
earth culture movement,” Modrak 
said. “I think a lot of (Tori’s) practices 
have this history in the ‘back to the 
land’ movement of the ’70s, and even 
the idea of transforming vehicles 
comes from that period.”

UHS exams help victims 

U-M provides on 
campus support 
for sexual assault 
survivors

By ALICE TRACEY

Summer Daily News Editor

University Health Servic-
es, the University of Michi-
gan’s student health center, 
is offering sexual assault 
exams administered on-site 
by trained sexual assault 
nurse examiners rather than 
making students travel to the 
emergency room after an inci-
dent. The service is designed 
to improve students’ access 
to examinations and provide 
care in a more comfortable 
and convenient environment.
According to Susan Ernst, 
the chief of the UHS Women’s 
Health Clinic, going to the 
emergency room after sexual 
assault can cause anxiety for 
a variety of reasons.
“We felt it was important to 
try to offer the SANE exams 
on the college campus really 
for the convenience of the 
students and to reduce the 
stress after sexual assault,” 
Ernst said. “Students might 
worry about trying to go over 
to the emergency department 
that they might get their 
insurance billed or that their 
parents might find out.”
UHS services are mostly 
free for students. Ernst added 
traveling to the emergency 
room can feel more intimi-
dating than going to UHS — a 
smaller, quieter setting with 
which students may already 
be familiar.
According to the website 
of the University’s Sexu-
al Assault Prevention and 
Awareness Center, the health 
service 
receives 
approxi-
mately 70,000 visits every 
year.
The SANE program was 
established in 2015 after the 
Association of American Uni-
versities published a survey 
exposing the prevalence of 
sexual assault on 27 cam-
puses, including the Univer-
sity of Michigan. The report 
found 30 percent of under-
graduate women had experi-

enced non-consensual sexual 
contact during their time at 
the University, compared to 
23 percent across all partici-
pating schools.
The University indepen-
dently conducted a follow-
up survey, which found 22 
percent 
of 
undergraduate 
women had experienced non-
consensual contact in the last 
year.
Ernst said the data were 
almost more worrying than 
the results of the AAU survey, 
because they revealed a high 
percentage of sexual assault 
over a shorter period of time.
The sexual assault sta-
tistics 
motivated 
student 
activists to reach out to 
University 
administration, 
which in response worked 
with UHS to set up a SANE 
program. Ernst said UHS had 
been considering the idea for 
a while, but the students who 
approached the administra-
tion with their concerns gal-
vanized the movement.
Public Policy senior Daniel 
Greene, Central Student Gov-
ernment president, and CSG 
Vice President Isabel Baer, 
an LSA junior, wrote in a 
joint email interview student 
involvement plays a critical 
role in confronting sexual 
assault.
“Addressing sexual assault 
requires 
a 
campus-wide 
effort,” 
Greene 
and 
Baer 
wrote. “The fact that 1 in 5 
females and 1 in 16 males are 
sexually 
assaulted 
during 
their undergraduate experi-
ence is unacceptable. Stu-
dent advocates on this issue, 
including 
ourselves, 
are 
continuing to examine the 
campus culture surrounding 
sexual misconduct.”
Because there were already 
sexual assault nurse examin-
ers working in the emergency 
center at the U-M hospital, 
the University did not need 
to hire new staff in order to 
make sexual assault exams 
available on campus. The 
trained nurses have specif-
ic on-call hours for sexual 
assault exams, so UHS asked 
the nurses to be available at 
both locations.

‘U’ Funds Environmental Projects

By KATHERINA SOURINE

Daily Staff Reporter 

Three research projects target-
ing socio-environmental sustain-
ability have received, in total, more 
than $200,000 from the Univer-
sity’s Graham Sustainability Insti-
tute. The projects tackle a range of 
sustainability-related issues, from 
green energy in Detroit to energy 
and food systems in Puerto Rico.
Paul Draus, a professor of soci-
ology at U-M Dearborn, serves as 
a researcher on the Green Energy 
Village in Detroit Eastern Market 
project, which received a $10,000 
Catalyst Grant. The first phase of 
the project, he explained, includes 
installing two upcycled wind tur-
bines in the Eastern Market, with 
plans to eventually develop a fea-
sibility plan for a microgrid: the 
Green Energy Village.
“Our hopes are that this public 
demonstration and the feasibility 
research that we conduct using the 
resources from the Catalyst Grant 
will enable us to leverage resources 
for a transformational upcycling/
green energy enterprise based in 
Detroit,” Draus explained. “Which 
saves resources at both ends — uti-
lizing discarded materials and local 
labor to create high-value machines 
that harvest energy from the wind 
and enhance the city’s overall resil-
ience.”
Juliette Roddy, professor of pub-
lic policy at U-M Dearborn, high-
lighted the multifaceted nature of 
the project, outlining the factors 
of economic effectiveness, envi-
ronmental efficiency and aesthetic 
implementation to the market. She 

emphasized the work of Carl 
Neibock, the designer and producer 
for the Green Energy Village, who 
developed the project through his 
vision of the potential of recycled 
windmills.
“Eastern Market is a valuable 
social space in Detroit and I believe 
that the combination of function 
and art/aesthetic will appeal to 
those who frequent the market,” 
Roddy said. “The windmills will 
easily charge a cell phone, a speak-
er for music, a laptop or — and I 
haven’t seen this yet, but Carl has 
great faith — an electric vehicle. 
The beauty and the practicality will 
inspire the Eastern Market visitors. 
I look forward to contributing to 
that.”
The second project, Reimagin-
ing Puerto Rico’s Energy and Food 
Systems 
through 
Community 
Engagement and Industrial Symbi-
osis, received the $200,000 Trans-
formation Grant. The project aims 
to work with community organi-
zations to solidify a system which 
manages agricultural production, 
food waste, gasification and energy 
production.
The project uses efforts from the 
University and Puerto Rican col-
lege students, as well as local non-
profits, to establish food and energy 
sectors in the mountain
side town of Adjuntas, which 
continued to experience difficulties 
with electricity and food and water 
access more than five months after 
Hurricane Maria.
In addition to volunteer work, 
the project will implement four 
hybrid solar/biomass gasification 
micro-grid systems. These systems 

will be subsequently monitored for 
their effectiveness and sustainability 
within their communities.
The third research project, Col-
laborative Assessment of Stormwa-
ter Runoff on Tribal Lands, was also 
awarded a $10,000 Catalyst Grant. 
The initiative was formed by a col-
laboration between the Great Lakes 
Integrated Sciences and Assessments 
Center and the Inter-Tribal Council 
of Michigan, in response to exten-
sive flooding which led to significant 
damage to the Lake Superior Tribe of 
Chippewa Indians in 2016. The flood-
ing highlighted the vulnerability of 
the community’s infrastructure and 
the need for preventative strategies 
for these extreme weather events.
The initiative outlines a process of 
researching the frequency and effects 
of rainfall per year in these communi-
ties, as well as assisting tribes in imple-
mentation of infrastructure that could 
decrease the effects of stormwater 
run-off. U-M Researcher Frank Mar-
sik offered semi-permeable pavement 
for parking lots and construction of 
street-side rain gardens as examples of 
potential solutions. “Given that many 
of the Indigenous Tribes are resource 
limited, both in terms of staffing and 
funding,” Marsik said, “our project will 
assist these Tribes to not only quantify 
the potential stormwater run-off given 
the specifics of the community’s land 
use practices, but our project will also 
help the Tribes to understand what 
practices (and their associated costs) 
could be implemented to reduce 
potential magnitude of stormwa-
ter run-off.”

W

hen we think about the 
liberal bastions of the 
world, there are several 
countries that tend to come to mind, 
including countries like Norway, 
Sweden and Denmark. It is very 
rare that someone names Ireland, a 
country almost synonymous with 
Catholic values, as a part of a list of 
socially liberal countries. However, 
Ireland has been making leaps 
forward in matters of inclusivity and 
human rights in the past few years. In 
a world where right-wing populism 
seems to be coming from every corner, 
maybe we should look to Ireland as a 
model for our path forward.
On May 25 the Republic of Ireland 
held a referendum on whether to 
repeal the Eighth Amendment to their 
constitution detailing the country’s 
strict restrictions on abortion. The 
Eighth Amendment was added to 
the Irish Constitution in 1983 after a 
referendum vote. This amendment 
was painted as equal protection of 
the right to life for mother and baby 
and prohibited abortion in most 
cases. Some of the few exceptions 
that allowed for abortion under this 
law included danger to the physical 
or mental health of the mother, rape 
and fatal health issues for the fetus. It 
isn’t surprising that a country with an 
over 78 percent Catholic population 
had such strict laws about abortion. It 
is, however, surprising that this same 
country voted with a 66 percent majority 
to repeal the Eighth Amendment and 
subsequent ban on abortion.
This massive step forward in 
women’s rights issues for Ireland is 
less surprising when looking back 

at the last couple of years in Ireland. 
In 2015, Ireland became the first 
country in the world to vote for the 
legalization of same-sex marriage by 
referendum, by 62 percent. Less than 
a month later, Ireland elected Leo 
Varadkar, an openly gay man, as the 
prime minister. Varadkar was also 
Ireland’s youngest prime minister 
in history and half Indian. All this 
progress, followed by last week’s 
decision to lift the ban on abortion, 
makes it clear: Ireland is not being left 
in the past any longer.
Much of this positive change 
comes during a time of overwhelming 
negativity 
in 
the 
world. 
Great 
Britain voted to exit the European 
Union in 2016 by a majority of 52 
percent following a long campaign 
of isolationism and xenophobia. 
Less than a year later, France faced 
an intense election season between 
Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel 
Macron. Though Macron won in 
a landslide with 66 percent of the 
vote, Le Pen still managed to run 
in the primary with an extremist 
conservative 
agenda. 
This 
all 
happening in conjunction with the 
United States’ experiment with right-
wing populists and nationalism with 
the election of Trump.
The world often seems to be 
slipping back in time when it comes to 
seemingly outdated laws and policies. 
At the beginning of May, Iowa 
approved the strictest abortion law in 
the country, making abortion nearly 
impossible once a fetal heartbeat has 
been detected. Meanwhile, on May 29 
the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the 
dispute over a 2015 law from Arkansas 

that made pill-induced abortions 
illegal. These policies come from a 
government led by politicians like 
Vice President Pence, who is known 
for his anti-abortion stance. In 2016 
Pence signed a bill as the governor 
of Indiana that would severely limit 
women’s access to abortion, even 
in cases where the child would be 
born with disabilities. This decision 
was overturned in April by a federal 
appeals court, but still shows us 
exactly what our country’s second-in-
command believes.
Ireland seems to be on an upswing 
right now and is making big strides 
in a short amount of time that will 
hopefully continue. However, it is 
important to remember how quickly 
that can change. Many of us thought 
that the United States might have 
been in a similar place when Barack 
Obama was elected as our first Black 
president or when gay marriage was 
legalized nationally. Unfortunately, 
directly following those few years 
of progress came the election of 
President Trump and a rise in open 
racism and misogyny.
Ireland is not perfect and still has 
a long way to go in issues of equality, 
particularly when it comes to issues 
of race and disability. However, in 
a world that can often feel like it’s 
falling apart, it’s reassuring to know 
that progress is still being made in a 
different corner of the world.

A state divided
L

iving in Orange County, 
California, 
one 
is 
constantly 
reminded 
of the paradoxical political 
climate. Here – the county 
Ronald Reagan described as 
the place “where all the good 
Republicans go to die,” the home 
to none other than Richard 
Nixon and the electoral district 
in which Hillary Clinton broke 
a seven decade-long conservative 
streak – conservative ideology 
stands tall. Here in California, the 
state legislature and executive 
branch are controlled exclusively 
by Democrats while the number 
of state-registered Independents 
recently overtook the number of 
state-registered Republicans.
The same partisan dichotomy 
is no less apparent on the issue 
of immigration. Late last year, 
California Gov. Jerry Brown 
signed into law Senate Bill 54, 
transforming 
California 
into 
the country’s most extensive 
“sanctuary 
state.” 
Orange 
County, host to nearly a tenth of 
California’s illegal immigrants, 
reacted by signing onto the 
lawsuit against the state of 
California proposed by President 
Donald Trump’s administration. 
By linking arms with the federal 
government, Orange County has 
fanned the flames of what has 
proved to be an acrimonious 
debate on immigration. 
While California has cleverly 
skirted some technicalities with 
S.B. 54, conservatives are right 
that the law affronts federal 
legitimacy. 
Sacramento’s 
conciliatory approach to illegal 
immigration, however, is in 
the spotlight for all the wrong 
reasons. 
Legal 
defiance 
of 
the 
Trump 
administration’s 
immigration approach should 
be highlighted, instead, for 
what 
it 
reveals: 
troubling 
inadequacy on the part of the 
federal government in search of 
effective immigration policy. 
Generally, 
immigration 
is 
a matter that should be left 
to the federal government. 
Not 
only 
is 
Congress 
constitutionally 
entrusted 
with 
the 
naturalization 
of 
immigrants, but immigration is 
a pivotal component of foreign 
affairs, a domain also entrusted 
to Congress. The reasoning 
is sound: A task as complex 
and nationally extensive as 
immigration would overburden 
the states. 

That said, states do hold 
some discretion over areas of 
immigration law where the 
federal government has yet 
to 
produce 
comprehensive 
policy. 
It’s 
why 
Arizona’s 
2010 
immigration 
law 
had 
provisions that dealt with the 
registration 
of 
noncitizens 
– a matter that had already 
been 
addressed 
by 
federal 
regulations – struck down; yet 
the law saw its components 
that 
addressed 
cooperation 
between 
state 
and 
federal 
officials – a matter outside of 
contemporary federal policy – 
upheld. The reasoning behind 
this is also sound: Federal laws 
hold preeminence over state 
ones, but power must also be 
balanced between state and 
national government, as per 
the U.S. Constitution. 
California’s S.B. 54 does just 
that with respect to illegal 
immigration, 
addressing 
realities on the ground that 
have 
been 
overlooked 
in 
Washington, D.C. As of 2012, 
California housed a quarter of 
the country’s undocumented 
immigrants, 
forcing 
the 
state to address them less 
as 
a 
logistical 
anomaly 
to 
be corrected and more as a 
near-permanent 
contingent 
deserving 
of 
comprehensive 
policy. The sheer number of 
undocumented 
immigrants 
in California, occupants who 
neither receive the intangible 
benefits of legal status nor 
pay respect to the legal path 
to citizenship (though many 
do, contrary to popular belief, 
pay taxes), is an unfortunate 
reality for which the blame 
partly rests on Congress.
Congress, in failing to pass the 
Comprehensive 
Immigration 
Reform Act of 2007, missed 
an opportunity to curtail the 
problem of illegal immigration 
on two fronts. The act would’ve 
cleared a path to citizenship 
for millions of undocumented 
immigrants already living in 
the U.S., eliminating the choice 
between mass deportation and 
continued subversion of the law, 
while also stymieing the flow of 
future illegal immigration via 
tightened border security.

JULIA MONTAG| COLUMN

I

t’s Monday night and your 
paper’s 
due 
sometime 
tomorrow. 
You 
spent 
your 
weekend 
unwinding 
– 
socializing, 
catching 
up 
on 
“Game of Thrones,” following 
your 
favorite 
NBA 
team 
– 
because let’s face it, you deserve 
some down time! So you sit down 
Monday, ready to begin this 
paper, and instead, you launch 
Instagram, just to get a brief 
idea of what you’ll be missing in 
your social circle tonight. Two 
hours later with zero progress 
made, you regret wasting your 
time.
This 
June, 
Apple, 
Inc. 
released new, groundbreaking 
software that aims to prevent 
this 
uniquely 
millennial 
circumstance from occurring. 
Apple’s 
annual 
Worldwide 
Developers Conference took 
place June 4, highlighting 
its platforms’ most recent 
iOS 12 software updates and 
forward-thinking initiatives. 
Users 
are 
getting 
excited 
about new ideas that will 
make iPhone harder to put 
down: 
group 
FaceTime, 
customizable 
animated 
emojis, an update to Siri’s 
intelligence and a 40-percent 
increase in overall speed. 
However, among the most 
radical 
of 
Apple’s 
2018 
announcements 
are 
those 
focusing 
on 
curbing 
our 
technolog y addiction.
Apple 
CEO 
Tim 
Cook 
admitted 
to 
CNNMoney’s 
Laurie 
Segall 
just 
how 
accidental 
the 
apparent 
iPhone addiction is.
“You know, we want people 
to be incredibly satisfied and 
empowered by the devices 
that we ship, but we never 
wanted people to spend a lot 
of time or all of their time on 
them,” Cook explained. “And 
we’re rolling out great tools 
to both make people aware 
of how much time they’re 
spending (on phones) and the 
apps that they’re spending it 
in, but also how many times 
they pick up their phone, 
how many notifications they 
get, who is sending them 
the 
notifications. 
(We’re) 
empowering people with the 
facts to decide themselves 
how they want to cut back or 
if they want to cut back.”
Companies like Apple and 

Google 
may 
be 
ironically 
seeking technolog y-limiting 
technolog y 
because 
of 
the 
recommendations 
of 
investors or because of the 
scientific 
findings 
that 
inform us just how greatly 
our health can suffer from 
staring at phones. Physically, 
screen time is detrimental to 
our eyes and neck, causing 
users to experience symptoms 
such as dry eyes, headaches, 
blurred vision and long-term 
shoulder and back pain. Sleep 
is often disrupted, especially 
when we fail to resist putting 
our phones away when getting 
ready for bed. The blue light 
emitted 
by 
iPhones 
can 
interrupt our bodies’ sleep 
cycles by interrupting the 
natural production of sleep-
inducing melatonin. Socially, 
immersion in social media 
can warp our sense of how 
person-to-person 
interactions 
are supposed to take place. 
Emotionally, increased phone 
exposure can make us more 
stressed, worried and prone to 
depressive symptoms.
The new iOS 12 features 
were designed to counter these 
health 
detriments, 
yet 
are 
falsely idyllic. They will pose 
questions about how much time 
spent on our phones is too much 
time, 
or 
whether awareness 
will be enough to curb our 
enthusiasm 
toward 
tech. 
So 
how will we as college students 
react to the accessibility of 
addiction curbing tools – to 
the accessibility of phone-use 
knowledge?
What 
are 
these 
“digital 
health” 
tools 
that 
will 
balance out the entertaining 
advancements of iOS 12 – 
the advancements that will 
further hook in users? One 
key 
digital 
health 
feature 
is the ability to pre-set “Do 
Not 
Disturb” 
time, 
which 
will allow us to sleep or work 
peacefully without receiving 
texts and email notifications. 
We will also have access to 
a weekly summary of our 
“Screen 
Time,” 
showing 
us exactly how much time 
we 
spend 
on 
our 
phone 
throughout the week, how 
many 
hours 
(and 
which 
specific 
hours) 
we 
spend 
mindlessly scrolling through 
each app. Finally, if these 

“Screen 
Time” 
summaries 
rattle your tech-conscience 
and make you want to use 
apps less, “App Limits” will 
allow you to set an exact time 
limit per day and only permit 
you to use the app until you’ve 
reached it. Additionally, you 
can’t work around the limit 
by using your iPad instead for 
the limits and summaries can 
be synced across devices.
What troubles me about 
these new iPhone features is 
the users’ capability to turn 
on or shut off the technolog y 
limits. 
Cook 
thinks 
“ultimately, each person has 
to make the decision, when 
they get their numbers, as 
to what they would like to 
do. 
I 
encourage 
everyone 
to look and everyone to make 
an informed decision, and ask 
themselves, if they’re picking 
up their phone 10 to 20 times 
an hour, maybe they could do 
it less … But I think the power 
is now shifted to the user. And 
that has been what Apple has 
always been about, is giving 
the power from the institution 
to the user.” So now the user 
has the power to limit how 
much 
time 
they 
spend 
on 
Instagram or Facebook; the 
issue, however, is that the App 
Limit is not only voluntary, but 
the user also has the power to 
extend it.
Will college students pass 
or fail? These new software 
features seem to say to us as 
tech-users that our iPhone 
addiction isn’t our fault, but 
is instead due to the simple 
architecture of the updates 
from the previous operating 
systems. 
Will 
we 
harness 
the new-and-improved “Siri 
Shortcuts” that monitor our 
habits and suggest we mobile-
order a coffee based on the 
predicted traffic? Or, will we 
utilize the “Do Not Disturb” 
features, the “Screen Time” 
summaries, the “App Limits” 
that comprise the up and 
coming 
Digital 
Health 
Initiative? We will find out 
later 
this 
summer 
when 
the iOS 12 update becomes 
available to the public.

OPINION

Thursday, June 14, 2018
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Alas, Washington floundered, 
and California was left to remedy 
its now-prolonged dilemma by 
facing reality. Undocumented 
immigrants 
began 
to 
be 
integrated into normal policy 
concerns, reflecting a national 
reluctance 
to 
truly 
take 
action. 
S.B. 
54’s 
protection 
of nonviolent undocumented 
immigrants from federal agents, 
on the grounds that local law 
enforcement is more effective 
when less of the populace is 
afraid to cooperate, is justified 
when Washington’s inaction is 
taken into account.
Calling 
back 
on 
recent 
legislative failures may help 
explain the current legal 
dilemma, but the only concern 
for many is that sanctuary 
protection 
invalidates 
the 
rule of law. No matter the 
convenience afforded to law 
enforcement due to sanctuary 
policies, nor the injustice 
imposed on undocumented 
immigrants by the severe 
backlog 
of 
American 
immigration procedures, the 
argument goes, welcoming 
undocumented 
immigrants 
as they are sends the message 
that 
U.S. 
immigration 
laws 
are 
pliable. 
While 
Trump’s 
misleading 
and 
race-baiting statements on 
immigration, 
along 
with 
a 
shift 
toward 
nativist 
policies and preferences for 
immigrants 
with 
specific 
traits and backgrounds, are 
inexcusable, 
these 
critics 
are right that circumventing 
Congress is not sustainable 
nor desirable. 
However, 
upon 
closer 
inspection, calls for a return 
to the rule of law also reveal 
that the true problem lies in 
failure to act at a national 
level. California’s S.B. 54 
stridently disregards federal 
law only in the sense that it 

actively prevents state and 
local law enforcement from 
sharing 
information 
with 
federal immigration officers, a 
provision directly at odds with 
federal immigration law, as 
outlined in 8 U.S. Code section 
1373. Other components of the 
law, namely the requirement 
that 
state 
and 
local 
officials 
release 
nonviolent 
undocumented 
immigrants 
in the face of orders from 
federal immigration officials, 
frustrate federal objectives 
yet exercise the perfectly legal 
practice of noncooperation. 
California’s pushback on 
federal policy, much like the 
aforementioned Arizona law, 
is only possible because much 
of the immigration issue has 
not 
been 
comprehensively 
addressed 
by 
Congress. 
Recent failures by Congress 
to come to consensus were 
met 
by 
President 
Barack 
Obama’s executive “stopgap” 
measure, Deferred Action for 
Childhood 
Arrivals, 
which 
has since been followed only 
by extensive indecision and 
refusal to move forward on 
the part of Trump. 
This stagnation decisively 
illustrates the need for new 
national legislation and policy 
that faces up to the struggles 
burdening the states. It also 
shows how bickering over 
the supremacy of federal 
law or the ability of states to 
avoid compliance amounts 
to wasted time and energy. 
 
Rather, 
comprehensive 
immigration 
reform 
by 
Congress is the only real 
solution when it comes to 
resolving the concerns of 
states like California and 
places like Orange County.

‘Lush’ resonates 
with youth, pride

MUSIC REVIEW

It’s not like this needs to be 
restated, but being a teenager 
is cool. Adolescence is full of 
unnecessarily 
intense 
and 
embarrassing 
experiences 
that 
shape the rest of your life. It’s 
often forgotten though, in the race 
to grow up, the odd beauty and 
shame of that period of your life. 
Things are put aside, left for years 
down the road, to be expressed in 
the words of someone a little older 
and wiser — but not for Lindsey 
Jordan of Snail Mail. Her debut 
album Lush is a remarkably candid, 
emotionally developed record that 
speaks to and from a teenage heart.
What separates Jordan from your 
average adolescent with a guitar 
and a taste for rock 
music is her ability to 
create songs that are 
aware of their emotion 
and power, but never 
get too self-absorbed. 
“Pristine” is one of the 
finest examples of this: 
Jordan repeatedly dismisses her 
feelings with “anyways, anyways,” 
but she’s still going to say and ask 
for what she wants. In the chorus 
she whines “and I know myself 
and I’ll never love anyone else,” 
but in the outro she finds peace, 
saying “I’ll still love you the same.” 
The 
acknowledged 
melodrama 
of “Pristine” is a perfect teenage 
moment, that experience of being 
15 when everything is new and 
awful and exciting, when there’s 
always something to feel.
Jordan still remains first and 
foremost a guitarist, and Lush is 
rife with moments of plush guitar 
playing that don’t make a big deal of 
themselves. “Heat Wave” springs 
to life with a convulsive riff that 

cuts right through the track and 
gets everything going. The picking 
pattern on “Let’s Find An Out” is 
as contemplative and pained as the 
sentiment behind the song. The 
slogging chords of “Deep Blue” pair 
well with Jordan’s wails of “it took 
so long to know someone like you.”
The core of Lush lies in the 
three-track run of “Let’s Find An 
Out,” “Golden Dream” and “Full 
Control,” where Jordan is at her 
most energetic and dynamic. “Let’s 
Find An Out” is one of the most 
poignant tracks on the album, 
which is surprising considering 
its brevity and lack of chorus. 
In it, Jordan mourns a stagnant 
relationship, struggling to find a 
resolution. On “Golden Dream,” 
a little more up-tempo, Jordan 
remembers who she is, finds an 
answer within herself 
and delivers one of 
the 
most 
cutting 
lines on the album: 
“God 
around 
your 
neck, he never did too 
much for you.” “Full 
Control” finishes this 
self-affirming trio, where Jordan 
asserts she’s her own person: “Even 
when it’s love, / Even when it’s not.”
Lush gets a little weighed down 
at the end, with “Deep Blue” and 
“Anytime” being both some of 
the longest and slowest tracks on 
the record, but it’s not enough to 
leave a real mark on the album’s 
quality. On “Deep Blue,” Jordan 
repeats a phrase from “Pristine” 
almost 
word-for-word: 
“We 
can be anyone.” The repetition 
is infrequent enough to be a 
mistake, but the phrase seems like 
a summary of Lush as a whole — 
standing on the edge of adulthood, 
full of energy and emotion and 
the realization that life has hardly 
started.
“Dietland”

Episodes 1-3

Mondays at 9 p.m.

AMC

MATADOR

The 
world 
envisioned 
by 
Marti Noxon’s new AMC series 
“Dietland” feels both frighteningly 
real and achingly distant. It’s 
a world filled with the usual 
indignities women are subject 
to — street harassment, body 
image issues, ageism. But it’s also 
a world that considers a radical 
new possibility: What if women 
stopped putting up with this shit? 
What would happen if they fought 
back?
We’re introduced to this world 
by Plum Kettle (Joy Nash, “Twin 
Peaks: The Return”), a plus-sized 
writer living in New York City 
where she ghostwrites an advice 
column for Kitty Montgomery 
(Julianna Margulies, “The Good 
Wife”) — the “skinny wax Dracula” 
who edits Austen Media’s teen 
style magazine Daisy Chain.
Kitty is polished, ruthless, 
unapologetic. Plum is not. A 
lifetime of being overweight has 
left her insecure 
and 
self-loathing. 
In a montage in the 
first episode, she 
recalls the myriad 
of 
unsuccessful 
fad 
diets 
and 
superfoods 
she’s 
subjected 
herself 
to.
Her hope now is an expensive 
lap band surgery, after which she 
dreams of a skinny, glamorous life 
as “Alicia,” her biological name and 
post-weight loss alter ego. Until 
then, an on-screen illustration 
shows she’s confined to life in a 

Penrose triangle of sorts: home, 
café, “Waist Watchers” meetings, 
and repeat.
Then one day, Plum receives 
a suspicious invitation to the 
basement of the Austen Media 
building. She’s been sent for by 
Julia (Tamara Tunie, “Law and 
Order: SVU”), the manager of the 
beauty closet, who asks Plum to join 
her underground crusade against 
the 
“dissatisfaction-industrial 
complex” which magazines like 
Daisy Chain perpetuate.
“They get us to pay them to tell 
us how broken we are, and then we 
pay for the products to fix it,” Julia 
says. “But we’re never fixed.”
In the backdrop of this mini-
resistance lies a guerrilla group 
called Jennifer: A radical women’s 
guerilla group that kills rapists and 
abusers before dropping them onto 
city sidewalks from airplanes. So 
clearly, there’s a lot going on.
That’s not necessarily a bad 
thing — the frenzy of “Dietland” 
is part of its charm. But it can be 
overwhelming, even off-putting, 
when a show tries 
to do so much 
and say so much 
while 
already 
throwing the rules 
of 
conventional 
storytelling 
out 
the window.
Fun, 
disorientingly 
illustrated 
sequences and surreal flashbacks 
are sprinkled throughout. The plot 
too is somewhat of a Trojan horse, 
the story of a gruesome vigilante 
group wrapped to look like some 
mild lesson on body acceptance 
and self-love.

It’s exactly the sort of strange, 
genre-bending, category-defying 
work you might expect from 
showrunner Marti Noxon, whose 
“UnREAL” 
and 
“Girlfriend’s 
Guide to Divorce” manage to 
transform from mindless fluff to 
dark humor to female rage without 
missing a beat.

Beneath all the noise, the show 
is lovingly and tenderly acted 
by Joy Nash, whose Plum might 
feel flat or dull were it not for the 
actress’s earnestness and nuance. 
As Kitty, Julianna Margulies is a 
comedic treat (and wears a wig far 
campier than her Alicia Florrick 
wig).
It’s glaringly obvious from their 
performances that — though the 
dream sequences and cartoons 
are fun — the show could stand 
to let its stars shine a bit more. 
For a show about empowerment 
and self-acceptance, “Dietland” 
doesn’t seem very confident in 
itself.

TV REVIEW

Thursday, June 14, 2018
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com ARTS

The two entered the venue 
dressed in the most opposite 
terms possible — Daveed Diggs 
sporting a Golden State Warriors 
bomber jacket, highly-distressed 
red jeans and a grill, Rafael 
Casal clean cut in an all-black 
button down and black slacks. 
They were a pair of walking 
statements, proud proclamations 
of individuality with blurred 
separating lines. They each stuck 
out in their own ways, so similar 
in that regard, that they could 
only come from somewhere the 
same. This shared, quilt-like 
quality, I came to realize over the 
next few hours, was the reality of 
everyone form the Bay Area – a 
tumultuous community of every 
race, religion, and creed, bounded 
by an acceptance of what is not 
their own.
Diggs and Casal were attending 
the 
Cinetopia 
Film 
Festival 
premiere of their first feature 
film “Blindspotting,” the story 
of two lifelong friends — Collin 
(Diggs), a convicted felon looking 
to pull his life back together, 
and Miles (Casal), a new father 
lost in an unfamiliar hometown. 
They both struggle to find their 
new places in a rapidly changing 
Bay Area. “The town,” as many 
Oakland natives would call it, is 
caught in the middle of a series of 
changes spurred on by the rapid 
gentrification of the region as 
well as national tensions related 
to race, class and gun ownership.
Diggs and Casal premiered 
their film on opening night at 
Sundance back in January, and 
“Blindspotting” is set for a nation-
wide release July 10.
In the few minutes I had to talk 
with Diggs and Casal, this sense 
idea of the “Oakland Artist” came 
up more than once. In response to 

a question about getting it right, 
Diggs said “that community is 
so isolated and self-sustaining — 
that the necessity to get it right 
— I don’t even know if people 
put [pressure] on us, we put it on 
ourselves, that’s a responsibility 
that we feel we owe the place we 
grew up. And everyone sort of 
gets it wrong, and sort of has a 
wrong perception of the Bay Area, 
so if you’re from there and you get 
the opportunity to project the Bay 
Area out onto the world, we want 
our friends to go ‘That’s right! 
That’s the bay area we know!’”
The duo had met at Berkeley 
High as teenagers and have been 
working 
collaboratively 
ever 
since. Both of their previous 
work has come largely in verse, 
Diggs as a rapper, most known for 
his membership on the original 
“Hamilton” Broadway cast, and 
Casal as a slam poetry performer 
featured on HBOs “Def Poetry 
Jam.” This attraction to form 
translates itself onto the screen 
in scenes that play out more like 
a musical than a drama. When 
asked about “the town’s” response 
to “Blindspotting,” he added 
“The thing about being an artist 
from the Bay is no one’s really 
checking for us, so we’ve been 
proud of each other anyways. 
And it’s really a pretty supportive 
artistic community. You’re always 
really excited when someone 
has something that breaks out 
and does well.” Casal chimed in 
“[Oakland] is one of the lenses 
with which we look at the world. 
I think our point of view of the 
world is so drastically affected by 
that upbringing that I think it will 
be omnipresent in everything we 
do, whether we try to or not.”
The film touches on many 
current social issues relevant to 
Oakland and to the Bay Area and 
is at its best when it allows these 
topics to exist bubbling under the 

surface rather than boiling to a 
head. “Blindspotting” is really 
a fun movie, until it reaches the 
point where it isn’t supposed to be 
fun anymore, Diggs and Casal’s 
ability to balance these opposing 
forces of levity and turmoil, an 
almost perfect microcosm to the 
current state of their home town 
— one stuck in an identity crisis, 
its transfixingly unique former 
self set up against a more sobering 
contemporary reality. Aside from 
some hiccups in the third act, the 
film delivers on its promise of a 
thought-provoking 
inspection 
on the modern intersection of 
race and class, managing to test 
its audience’s own preconceived 
notions through to the end.
The biggest accomplishment 
of the film is its wonderful 
array of characters, the list of 
notables stretching far past the 
central two. Each new, eccentric 
Oaklander 
added 
on 
screen 
contributes 
to 
the 
pulsating 
diorama of the two writers’ roots. 
These peripheral, sometimes one-
off, characters fill a wide range 
of race, class, and profession, 
melding together into a stunning 
mosaic of what was once “the 
town” and what could still be. 
The only characters who aren’t 
given this colorful treatment are 
the harbingers of kale smoothies 
and vegan burgers, the plaid fleet 
of gentrifying yuppies, the tech-
centric, oh-so-vilified hipsters, 
whose addition to the region don’t 
just raise property value but raise 
tensions as well. Miles, the Bay 
Area fundamentalist of the film, 
doesn’t hide his disdain for the 
geeky newcomers, he literally 
attacks the issue of gentrification 
opening up dialogue on a set of 
deeper issues as the film works its 
way to its close.

SUMMIT ENTERTAINMENT

CLARA SCOTT
Daily Arts Writer

I can remember those days 
clearly: Sitting with my dad as 
a child, the rain falling slowly 
outside and the sardonic yet 
calming voice of Anthony Bourdain 
on the television. By the time I 
was old enough to actually choose 
my own entertainment, I always 
loved Bourdain’s shows, from “No 
Reservations” to “Parts Unknown” 
and all the appearances and books 
in between. I stole my parents’ iPod 
and watched reruns on the tiny 
screen, wishing I could taste and 
feel the things this crazy, wonderful 
man did in all the crazy, wonderful 
places he went. Watching Bourdain 
was one of the ways my dad and I 
connected, through a shared love 
of people who didn’t give even one 
crap, leading to a joint adoration 
of a man who truly took his own 
advice. I felt as if I was friends with 
this man on the screen and the 
page, and continued to be a massive 
fan of the former chef as I grew up.
If I was sad or lost or needed 
some inspiration to whisk me away 
from suburbia, I turned on one of 
Bourdain’s shows and fell straight 
into the daring cuisine of Malaysia, 
light-saturated skylines of Tokyo 
or the cobblestone-lined streets of 
Cuba, far away from my problems 
and lack of adventure. Talking to 
people my own age, I found that 
this experience was not only mine, 
but a common thread between 
many teenage girls, their fathers 
and their search for whimsy in the 
unknown. Anthony Bourdain was 
not only charming and intelligent, 
but a people person too. He held 
no prejudices, ate what people 
gave him in an effort to connect 
and made connections with locals 
in the places he traveled, over 
a career that spanned decades. 
Those who followed his career 
would know that this sense of 

familiarity did not just end with 
the lucky few he actually met, but 
anyone who stumbled upon his 
work — Bourdain’s charisma was 
not intimidating, but welcoming, 
as if anyone who could stand 
their ground in conversation and 
consumption was a guest in his life.
When I learned of his death 
earlier this week, I was absolutely 
and 
completely 
crushed. 
The 
details of Bourdain’s passing are 
devastating on their own, proof of 
a massive problem in our society 
which will take more than a phone 
number to fix. It is impossible 
to imagine what his family is 
experiencing right now, and for 
that, I will give the issue its space. 
Instead, I feel that it is more useful 
right now to celebrate what the 
iconic man achieved, created and 
meant to all of us than settle into 
grief. Bourdain was a professional 
live-r, if there ever was a thing. 
He had a job that any of us would 
kill for, a career explained by the 
man himself in a New Yorker 
interview as “I travel around the 
world, eat a lot of shit and basically 
do whatever the fuck I want.” But 
not all would have the guts and 
bravado to actually find success in 
that pursuit, to create something 
new and beautiful out of every 
dirty alley and shambly food truck.
Bourdain taught people of all 
ages to truly appreciate all the 
hidden magic around them, and 
for that he carried a bit of magic 
around himself. No matter the 
darkness he dealt with internally 
or 
encountered 
on 
his 
path, 
Bourdain’s 
piercing 
wit 
and 
exuberance for what the world had 
to offer was contagious. For that, 
we will miss him. For him, crack 
open a beer tonight and savor it. If 
there’s one thing we can learn from 
Anthony Bourdain’s life, it’s that 
you never know where your next 
adventure could be until you seek it 
out yourself.

New cancer study 

U-M researcher’s 
discovery leads to 
potential improvement 
of cancer therapy

By ROB DALKA

Daily Staff Reporter 

Researchers at the Univer-
sity of Michigan Rogel Cancer 
Center have determined cancer 
cells seize control of the meta-
bolic pathways within specific 
immune cells to suppress the 
immune system and accelerate 
tumor growth.
Immune suppressor cells that 
exist in cancerous tumors block 
the body’s natural defense sys-
tem, and a high volume of these 
immune suppressor cells can ren-
der the immune system ineffec-
tive at fighting tumor growth.
Previously, researchers had lit-
tle understanding of what caused 
the development of immune sup-
pressor cells but did recognize 
the necessity of a healthy immune 
system in the battle against can-
cer. Immunotherapy, which har-
nesses a patient’s own immune 
system to fight cancer, has been 
very successful for survivors of 
certain cancers.
“Immunotherapy 
includes 
treatments that work in differ-
ent ways,” the American Can-
cer Society states on its website. 
“Some boost the body’s immune 
system in a very general way. 
Others help train the immune 
system to attack cancer cells spe-
cifically.”
The 
limited 
understand-
ing of the immune-suppressing 
cells makes it difficult to treat 
certain types of cancers using 
immunotherapy. Cancers, such 
as triple-negative breast cancer 
– the cancer cell line used in this 
research because of its prominent 
immune suppressor cells – are 
especially difficult to treat. Tri-
ple-negative breast cancer lacks 
three common receptors that 
stimulate tumor growth, making 
it harder to treat.
“Since the tumor cells lack the 
necessary receptors, common 
treatments like hormone therapy 
and drugs that target estrogen, 
progesterone, and HER-2 are 
ineffective,” the National Breast 
Cancer Foundation states on 

its website. Chemotherapy is 
often a triple-negative breast 
cancer patient’s only option.
Weiping Zou, a renowned 
professor of surgery and pri-
mary researcher in the study, 
explained the issue with cur-
rent 
immunotherapy 
treat-
ment.
“Immunotherapy works very 
well for some patients, but not 
everyone is responsive to the 
treatment,” Zou said. “Through 
this study we hope to improve the 
current treatment to make it bet-
ter for more people.”
During 
the 
project, 
the 
researchers studied the tumors’ 
growth in mice, approved by 
the committee on Use and Care 
of Animals at the University of 
Michigan. They were able to mea-
sure the growth of the tumors 
and find the factors that caused 
the processes within them. The 
researchers also studied culti-
vated cells separately. Extensive 
measurements were taken during 
the experiment on tumor growth 
and cell production which were 
then analyzed using various data 
analytical techniques.
Dr. Inka Kryczek, Research 
Assistant Professor of Surgery, 
summarized the various parts of 
the process they studied.
“We looked at the metabolic 
pathways, the immunosuppres-
sive cells themselves, and the 
biology of the tumor. It proved to 
be a very comprehensive study.” 
said Kryczek.
The new research sheds some 
light on what could be causing 
the development of the immune 
suppressor cells. A link found 
between the metabolic produc-
tion of glycolysis and the number 
of the immune suppressor cells 
present in the tumor showed a 
direct correlation between an 
increase in glycolysis and an 
increase in immune suppressor 
cells.
Zou believes the discovery 
can lead to new treatments for 
patients that exhibit high num-
bers of the immune suppressor 
cells.
“We hope we can manipulate 
the metabolic pathways to devel-
op an immunotherapy approach 
to help these patients,” Zou said.
Zou 
also 
anticipates 
the 
research 
will 
inspire 
other 
researchers to develop better 
techniques for treatment.

EPYC for now, EPYC forever 
 
 

When My last piece 
about 
the 
National 
Federation of Filipino 
American 
Associa-
tions was written on a 
plane. So naturally,this 
NaFFAA piece is being 
written during another 
flight. I am currently 
on my way to spend a 
summer in Washing-
ton, D.C., and I can’t 
help but be thankful 
for all that the Empow-
ering 
Filipino 
Youth 
through Collaboration 
Ambassadors Program 
has done for me.
My start with EPYC 
almost never happened 
actually. It started last 
summer with an email 
forwarded by a good 
friend who was intern-
ing in DC at the time.
“If you haven’t seen 
this and are interest-
ed!” was the one line 
in her forward. And 
from the prospects of 
connecting with other 
Filipinx 
Americans, 
learning 
more 
about 
civic engagement, and a 
chance to better myself 
as 
a 
self-proclaimed 
Filipino 
American 
advocate, I was defi-
nitely interested.
I knew I had to apply, 
but the flaw that was 
holding me back then 
was a subtle lack of 
confidence. I had never 
done anythi ng on a 
national scale before. 
I know I harp on this 
a lot, but it’s still true, 
but growing up in small 
towns 
where 
corn-
fields are endless real-
ly shaped me. Although 
it grew a strong yearn-
ing for exploration of 
myself and my culture, 
I really thought work 
on large scales, like a 
national one, were for 
people from big cit-
ies. Before the EPYC 
ambassadors program, 
I thought that I was not 

qualified as someone 
who didn’t have a large 
Filipinx 
American 
community to rely on. 
But of course, I knew 
that wasn’t a valid rea-
son to not apply. I knew 
that if I didn’t give it an 
honest try that I would 
regret it. I spent many 
days 
rewriting 
my 
resume, my personal 
statement, and asking 
advice 
from 
trusted 
confidants; I ended up 
sending my application 
while I was at a wed-
ding in California using 
free, 
limited 
hotel 
Wi-Fi and minutes to 
spare on the deadline 
(very off-brand for me 
but such is life). When I 
got the acceptance let-
ter from Jason Tengco, 
the Executive Direc-
tor of NaFFAA, I was 
totally thrilled, to say 
the least.
The 
EPYC 
ambas-
sadors program didn’t 
start and end with a 
convening in the Bay 
Area. Like I said before 
in my last article, the 
EPYC 
ambassadors 
program as a whole 
gave me the tools and 
resources to be a more 
confident leader. But 
within that were lay-
ers upon layers of self-
discovery.
I always wondered 
what life was like for 
young Filipinx Ameri-
cans outside the Mid-
west. Because of EPYC, 
I have been given the 
privilege to listen to 
the lived experiences of 
the rest of the ambassa-
dors, who are now my 
friends. I am now able 
connect with my Pinoy 
peers all across the 
United States instead 
of speculate what dias-
pora looks like outside 
my own lived experi-
ence. I looked forward 
to every monthly webi-
nar because it means 
learning 
something 
new about important 

topics such as racial 
justice, 
media, 
and 
Filipino American his-
tory. Through EPYC, 
I was able to redis-
cover the strengths of 
my leadership that I 
already had all along.
And one of the most 
important things I’ve 
learned along the way 
is that there is power 
in 
mobilizing 
the 
youth--not only for the 
future but most cer-
tainly for the issues 
that we as marginal-
ized communities face 
daily.
My passion for civic 
engagement and advo-
cacy has even more so 
intensified thanks to 
NaFFAA 
and 
EPYC. 
Now that I am going 
to intern in DC, I 
would like to believe 
that EPYC has helped 
light my pathway to 
public 
service. 
In 
the more immediate 
sense, EPYC allowed 
me to expand upon 
my skills of student 
organizing 
through 
a 
capstone 
project 
where I collaborated 
with many other lead-
ers in many different 
Filipinx American and 
AAPI communities to 
increase civic engage-
ment in the Midwest.
Now that my first 
year with EPYC is com-
ing to a close, my hope 
is to continue with 
NaFFAA and the youth 
branch for years to 
come because I believe 
so much in this mis-
sion. From my perspec-
tive, EPYC is a pipeline 
to get aspiring, young 
Filipinx 
American 
leaders out into the 
world--for the culture 
and social good.
I 
cannot 
wait 
to 
see the next cohort 
of 
ambassadors 
and 
the amazing things to 
come. My advice? Be 
brave. Be unapologetic. 
Be EPYC.

I’ve only ever seen my 
mother cry three times. One 
of those times was when the 
audiologist announced I had 
a hearing loss and would 
have to wear hearing aids. 
As strange as it sounds, I am 
thankful for being born hard 
of hearing. I believe that it 
has had a unique impact on 
the way I’ve grown up and 
has allowed me to be more 
empathetic to people with 
other disabilities and even 
other social identities in 
which I have privilege.
However, I didn’t always 
see my hearing loss in such 
a positive light. When I 
first started my education, 
I went to a private school 
where nobody realized I 
had hearing loss. Because 
of this, the teachers always 
reacted negatively to me 
because I never listened to 
their instructions. Since it 
seemed I wasn’t being obe-
dient, the teachers and my 
parents incorrectly believed 
that I had a learning disabil-
ity. This was the beginning 
of my feeling like an outcast 
throughout my first years 
of school, especially since I 
had neon pink hearing aids. 
After I switched to public 
school, I spent a lot of time 
in speech therapy because I 
wasn’t speaking as properly 
as the other students my age, 
making me feel like an alien 
in my surroundings. 

I was also detached from 
my culture. At the time, out-
dated psychological studies 
led educators to believe that 
children growing up learn-
ing two languages at the 
same time had less fluency 
in both languages. How-
ever, modern-day psycho-
logical studies have proven 
the opposite: Learning two 
languages at once is ben-
eficial to children’s learning 
experiences. However, the 
educators and profession-
als at my schools constantly 
warned my parents not to 
speak in our native language 
with me at home. As a result, 
I speak extremely broken 
Telugu (my native language) 
and struggle to understand it 
as well as I might have been 
able to. 
While 
I 
eventually 
became able to overcome 
this and come to acceptance 
with my hearing loss, it 
wasn’t always easy to do this. 
A lot of the incidents I expe-
rienced at a younger age also 
made me feel even more self-
aware about any differences 
I had from other kids.
Entering high school, I 
learned how to channel the 
pain and frustration I con-
tinued to feel about my hear-
ing aids into more creative 
endeavors such as writing 
and art. While art helped me 
discover a whole history and 
culture behind my disability, 
writing helped me express 
feelings from my childhood 
that I had suppressed for 

such a long time.
I had always felt I wasn’t 
good enough, and my hear-
ing aids had become a tangi-
ble reminder of my isolation. 
Working on approaching 
this became one of my goals, 
and I slowly began to realize 
how much having a hearing 
loss had helped me grow. I 
often felt isolated because I 
didn’t know any other kids 
with hearing aids, but I’ve 
learned, slowly, to accept 
this aspect of my identity.
And yes, I don’t view this 
as a flaw or a disability any-
more. After learning about 
the beauty of deaf culture 
and learning how people 
who are hard of hearing and 
deaf have been able to form 
a community and express 
all their pain and frustra-
tion, it’s become clearer to 
me that this is an identity of 
mine, not something to be 
fixed or to be ashamed or 
scared of.
To anyone reading this 
who may be isolated because 
of a hearing loss, I can tell 
you that I have found sol-
ace in learning about deaf 
culture, making art and 
expressing 
my 
feelings 
through writing. It’s crucial 
to deal with any feelings of 
isolation you may be hav-
ing about your identity, no 
matter what it is and it’s also 
important to learn about the 
history behind since his-
tory will always continue to 
empower and validate your 
identity.

SPORTS

When you think of an All-
American 
track 
and 
field 
athlete, what comes to mind?
Is it someone who has spent 
their entire life committed to 
perfecting their craft? Early 
mornings and late nights spent 
on the track, crafting the 
perfect training routine? What 
if it was someone who hadn’t 
competed on a track throughout 
their entire high school career?
Well, that is the legend of 
Claire Borchers.
The senior opted to play 
soccer in high school rather 
than compete in track and field, 
only running in the fall for her 
cross country squad. While her 
peers were becoming nationally 
recognized 
track 
stars, 
Borchers was trading in spikes 
for cleats and running around 
chasing a soccer ball.
But at the NCAA Outdoor 
Championships, none of that 
mattered. As she rounded the 
last lap of the 3000-meter 
steeplechase, Borchers reached 
deep and tapped every last drop 
of fuel she had left in the tank.
For most of the race, Borchers 
was solidly positioned at the 
back of the pack, not wanting to 
exert any unnecessary energy 
too early in the contest. She 
played to her strengths and 
waited for her moment to strike. 
As she entered the final lap, the 
senior was sitting in seventh 
place, narrowly in contention 

for All-American honors as the 
top-eight finishers earn the 
title.
Knowing the glory that comes 
with a late-race surge, Borchers 
saw her collegiate career flash 
before her eyes before turning 
on the burners. She advanced 
an additional two spots before 
entering into the final stretch 
of the tight race, good for fifth 
in the field.
Then in a desperate battle 
for recognition, glory, fame 
or whatever coveted feeling 
that 
comes 
with 
athletic 
achievement, Borchers surged 
to 
a 
fourth-place 
finish, 
narrowly 
beating 
out 
Val 
Constien of Colorado at the 
finish line.
“I was really zoned in, just 
kinda one straight at a time” 
Borchers told MGoBlue.com. 
“But still I was just realizing 
that I still had something in the 
tank, and that’s one of the best 
feelings that you can have in a 
race. I was definitely stressed, 
physically a bit, but when you 
have that gear it’s fun to just 
channel it.”
After it was all said and done, 
Borchers had run the fastest 
final lap of any athlete in the 
race, topping the field with a 
time of 72.09 seconds and truly 
embodying the ferocious spirit 
that Michigan distance runners 
have come to represent.
It’s no doubt that Borchers 
drew inspiration from 2017’s 
NCAA Outdoor Champion in 
the 1,500-meter — and the 

Wolverines’ 
first 
— 
Jaimie 
Phelan. Through her relentless 
running style and late-race 
power, Phelan reigned supreme 
over her peers and created a 
culture of success at Michigan. 
Phelan has also inspired the 
likes of this year’s NCAA 
Champion 
for 
Michigan 
— 
senior Ben Flanagan.
“I just thought about Jamie 
Phelan for the first part of my 
race,” Borchers said. “I mean, 
I watched that race when she 
sat in the back and had that 
amazing kick, and not that I 
was expecting to have that kind 
of amazing kick, but I knew a lot 
is possible if you can just keep 
your head on your shoulders.”
Also 
competing 
for 
the 
Wolverines in Eugene, Ore. 
were seniors Aaron Howell 
and Haley Meier and fifth-year 
senior Sarah Zieve.
Despite 
displaying 
an 
admirableperformance in the 
heptathlon, 
Howell 
finished 
18th and just 100 points shy of 
All-American honors. While 
her place may not have been 
where she wanted it, Howell 
did add an Honorable Mention 
award and personal bests in the 
javelin throw and 800-meter 
run to her resumé.
As Michigan heads back to 
Ann Arbor to begin preparation 
for next season, it can hold its 
head high. The Wolverines who 
competed left everything on the 
track and can be proud when 
reflecting back on the 2018 
outdoor season.

Borchers earns All-American honors

The 
Michigan 
men’s 
lacrosse team has pegged 
Justin Turri to be its new 
assistant 
coach 
for 
the 
up-and-coming program.
For a team in the process 
of 
laying 
the 
foundation 
to become a powerhouse 
club, 
it 
all 
begins 
with 
personnel. Just a year ago, 
the Wolverines added head 
coach Kevin Conry to their 
roster, stealing him from 
Maryland where he served 
as the Terrapins’ defensive 
coordinator. 
Maryland, 
a 
consistent 
national 
title 
contender, has the pedigree 
of a program that means 
business.
At this point in the process, 
gaining the mindset of a 
title-contending 
program 
is the name of the game 
for Michigan. Once a solid 
coaching and recruiting core 
is established, top talent will 
follow. And with the hiring 
of Turri, the Wolverines 
are a step closer to reaching 
their goals.
“We 
are 
thrilled 
to 
welcome 
Justin 
to 
Michigan,” said Conry of 
Turri’s appointment. “Justin 
has an outstanding track 
record of success and is a 
true up and coming star in 
the coaching world.”
Last season, Turri worked 
as the offensive coordinator 
for Harvard, coaching elite 
collegiate 
talent 
such 
as 
All-American 
and 
All-Ivy 
League star Morgan Cheek. 
With such proximity to high-
productivity players, Turri’s 
experience will greatly aid a 
young Michigan team.
Under 
Turri, 
the 
Crimson’s offense boasted 
the 
28th-ranked 
scoring 
offense 
in 
the 
nation, 
scoring 
10.85 
goals 
per 
game. Harvard’s rank marks 
a 10 spot increase over the 
Wolverines’ offensive unit 
who comes in at 38 with 
10.14 goals per game.
In addition, Turri looks 
to help a Michigan lacrosse 
team that went 8-6, 1-4 in 
Big Ten play and narrowly 
missed 
making 
the 
Big 
Ten 
Tournament. 
The 

Wolverines scored 142 goals 
on 485 shots on goal, good 
for a .293 shot percentage — 
second to last in the Big Ten. 
For a team that drastically 
needs 
to 
improve 
its 
offensive efficiency, Turri 
could prove to be a valued 
offseason acquisition.
Prior 
to 
joining 
the 
Crimson, Turri has worked 
to 
perfect 
the 
craft 
of 
coaching at Army West Point 
and Providence. With the 
Black Knights, Turri helped 
sharpen the team’s faceoff, 
offense and extra-man units 
and worked in a similar 
capacity with the Friars.
Turri’s collegiate lacrosse 
experience truly began as a 
player and four-year starter 
for Duke. Quickly emerging 
as a key member of the team, 
Turri led the Blue Devils to 
a national championship in 
2010 and two ACC titles in 
2009 and 2012.
Furthermore, Turri was 
named a two-time USILA 
All-American and finished a 
dream lacrosse career with 
70 goals and 52 assists. Turri 
has a wealth of knowledge 
when it comes to offensive 
productivity as he can draw 
sage guidance from his days 
as a top-level player or coach.
After 
leaving 
Duke, 
Turri ascended to the pros 
where 
he 
continues 
to 
play at a high level with 
the Boston Cannons. After 
getting 
drafted 
by 
the 
Charlotte Hounds in 2012 
and bouncing around a few 
teams 
in 
Major 
League 
Lacrosse, the midfielder has 
seemingly found a home in 
Boston since he was named 
the team’s MVP for the 2017 
season, notching nine goals 
in eleven games.
While 
balancing 
a 
professional schedule and a 
prominent coaching position 
may seem like a daunting 
task, Turri has proved he 
is up to the challenge after 
carrying 
a 
similar 
load 
the past few seasons with 
Harvard and Army.
For a team with a young 
core and and an exciting new 
coach, Turri could prove 
to be the missing piece to 
finally get Michigan over the 
hump.

ALEC COHEN / DAILY
Junior second baseman Faith Canfield contributed to a team that showed complacency late into the season and the postseason

By no means was the 2017-18 season 
disappointing for the Michigan softball 
team — after all, it amassed a 44-13 
overall record and won the Big Ten 
outright. But for the expectations, for 
the effort, for the bitter ending, was it 
worth it?
The team collected 18 and 15-game 
win streaks only to go on to lose six of 
its last 11 games. After going on a tear 
through the Big Ten regular season, 
fixing their non-conference record 
after a rocky star and playing at what 
looked to be their full potential, the late 
season collapse reeked of one thing — 
complacency.
***
The 
negative 
change 
for 
the 
Wolverines most notably occurred 
starting on Apr. 28, when they faced 
off against Indiana. After a dominant 
run that only saw one loss in 15 Big 
Ten games, Michigan looked prime to 
run away with the title, maybe even by 
winning out the rest of the games.
That all changed when the Hoosiers 
came up to bat at the bottom of the ninth 
inning.
In fact, on three separate occasions 
throughout the game, the Wolverines let 
up for a moment that would give Indiana 
a chance. And for every opportunity 
Michigan gave, Indiana took.
After building a 4-0 lead entering the 
bottom of the fourth, the Wolverines 
saw the short-lived gap close to one in 
the blink of eye. By the time the team 
took note of the ensuing threat, it was 
too late. Indiana had tied the game at 

the last possible second — in the seventh 
inning with two outs.
Though adjustments were made — 
pulling senior right-hander Tera Blanco 
for freshman left-hander Meghan 
Beaubien, the team’s ace — the damage 
had been done. The game was headed 
to extra innings where Michigan would 
eventually fall in the ninth to a walk-
off homer. Had Michigan not looked 
so dominant on defense all season and 
all game before the collapse, perhaps it 
could have been waved off as just one 
team getting the better of another in a 
heated match.
But it’s safe to say, after the rest of 
the season played out, this game was 
no outlier. There was no one-time error 
or undeniable excuse that would allow 
the team to play it off as a fluke, a short-
straw drawn. It was a breakdown.
“I felt that we might’ve just played 
on our heels a little bit,” said Michigan 
coach Carol Hutchins. “We had several 
opportunities to keep scoring, and we 
left eleven runners on base. And it just 
allowed them to stay confident that 
they were within striking distance. 
Whether it’s at-bats or whether it was on 
the mound and we weren’t really –– we 
had to go for the kill when we had the 
opportunity to do it.”
The lack of a final blow for the kill 
was no act of mercy. They had the 
athleticism. They had the talent. It was 
the mentality that led to the decline 
in level of the Wolverines’ play, the 
feeling of safety that followed a Goliath 
facing David. This was the team that 
had commanded a 5-1 win against the 
Hoosiers just a day before. This was the 
team that had won five games before the 

win against Indiana by a minimum of 
six runs. This was a then-39-7 team that 
held a 4-0 lead against a sub-.500 team.
It wasn’t just getting outplayed. It 
was complacency that left the team at 
the mercy of its opposition.
Until that point, Michigan had held 
its opponents to four or fewer runs a 
game — even in its losses. But just like 
that, the Wolverines let up five runs in 
the back half of a game they had under 
control. It was a loss many deemed 
would be a wake-up call. And it was, 
but only for a single game. The mental 
rut continued as Michigan would lose 
8-2 against Western Michigan in their 
worse loss of the year.
***
Just when doubt crept in, the 
Wolverines found it in them to dispel it 
just as quickly. After a statement 8-0 five-
inning win in East Lansing, Michigan 
looked like it had overcome its demons 
— even more so when late-game heroics 
from freshman designated-hitter Lou 
Allan helped turn the tide in a tense 3-2 
win against Ohio State.
And at the very apex of the season, 
the Wolverines beat the Buckeyes — a 
commanding five-inning 8-0 win on 
Senior Day — to clinch the Big Ten 
outright, returning to form after a one-
year absence from the title.
“Last year, it was tough,” said junior 
second baseman Faith Canfield. “So 
I think setting out this year, we really 
wanted it, and it was rough. Don’t get 
me wrong, it was really hard, but it feels 
good. It feels really good.”
And as high as a feel-good high can 
go, there are also disappointing lows. 
Ironically, the Wolverines felt those 

lows when they allowed season-highs 
in runs and errors in their final game 
against Ohio State. While meaningless 
in every aspect but pride, it’s astonishing 
not why the loss occurred, but how.
A five-inning run-rule home loss was 
the first time in over a decade that that 
occurred. The sold-out crowd, which 
was deafening the day before, was 
dead silent as early as the first inning. 
Nothing went right, even if the team 
didn’t need it to at the moment.
After all, win or loss, they already 
clinched the first seed in the Big Ten 
Tournament, secured a winning series 
record against their rival and proved 
themselves capable of dealing with the 
Big Ten’s biggest threats.
But the fact remains that the team 
faced a bad loss for the last regular 
season game and just before the 
postseason. From here, it comes down 
to which route the team takes: does the 
humiliating loss light the fire for a fierce 
response or do they fall into the trap of 
continuing on the negative momentum? 
And most importantly, are they satisfied 
with winning the Big Ten, or do they 
have the motivation and aspirations to 
take them all the way?
As Hutchins noted, confidence is 
the most important thing in the closing 
hours of the season.
However, mentality is just as 
important in order to find postseason 
success. Michigan proved it just didn’t 
have either.
“We think (winning the Big Ten 
is) a great accomplishment, but it’s not 
the most important accomplishment,” 
Hutchins said after the Buckeyes’ loss. 
“I spoke a little before the game on if 
we’re gonna settle. Are we just going to 
be the Big Ten Champion, and I’d like to 
see us hungry again to get to the World 
Series... We didn’t look like we had any 
hunger tonight.”
Hunger is what fuels middle of the 
pack teams to the top. It’s what pushes 
the best of the best to be even better. And 
it was the one thing Michigan seemed to 
lack.
***
Despite having a lot on their plate, 
the Wolverines looked like they’ve had 
their fill.
A bounce back year. A young team 
exceeding expectations. A Big Ten title. 
It felt like Michigan had accomplished 
what it had set out to do. What more 
could it ask for?
Because a successful postseason 
looked completely out of the picture.
The Wolverines completely botched 
their opening game in the Big Ten 
Tournament with a 7-0 loss to the 
Spartans. It looked like the lack of 
hunger from the final regular season 
game carried over to the tournament, as 
the team wasn’t playing up to their Big 
Ten record — the best in the conference. 
And it didn’t stop there.

Complacency only carries so far after 
the accomplishment. But well within 
the deep postseason, Michigan still 
looked unmotivated, unable to conjure 
any spark on offense and barely able to 
get by on defense.
After another crushing loss in 
the first round against Notre Dame, 
Michigan looked completely finished. 
There were no highs to get complacent 
on. It was just falling action and a 
conclusion. For all the exposition — the 
preseason expectations for a talented, 
young team, the rising action, the 
growth and development throughout 
season’s success and the climax. The 
thrills of a title and the aftermath.
It’s all celebratory until it isn’t. The 
Wolverines were thrown one final 
lifeline — their last chance in the double 
elimination NCAA Regional — where 
they fell victim to the complacency 
that plagued them in the latter half of 
the season. After five scoreless innings 
against the Fighting Irish, the Michigan 
defense, for the most part, looked back 
in action. Three hits through those five 
innings were all Notre Dame could 
muster up, all resulting in stranded 
runners.
Then, in a moment of hope in an 
extendedly bleak period, Michigan 
broke open the scoring with a sacrifice 
flyout that pushed Canfield home. And 
just like the scoring drought, the tension 
in the dugout broke as well. Seeing the 
runner score offered some resemblance 
of relief for the team that was backed 
into a corner.
The Fighting Irish took advantage 
of the lapse in tension. In the bottom 
half of the sixth, Michigan collapsed 
to let Notre Dame score two to flip the 
lead. It was as if all defensive focus that 
was so heavily emphasized early in 
the game had dissipated after the first 
run was scored. The pressure was on 
the Wolverines, and just as they had 
all game before the sixth inning, they 
couldn’t find an answer.
***
There was never any doubt that this 
young team would have weaknesses 
in experience. But the problem was 
never about physicality or talent. It was 
all mental, and it was something the 
underclassmen experienced too late.
The veterans in the team failed to 
notice — despite all the culture change, 
all the fun and simplifications they 
added to make the game easier — that 
the problem was getting too high after 
wins and failing to recover from the 
lows after losses. It’s simple. The team 
lacked the hunger to take them all the 
way. Sure, they exceeded preseason 
expectations and won the Big Ten title. 
But to end as badly as they did, was it 
worth it?

Was it worth it?

With 100 meters to go in the 
men’s 10,000-meter national 
championship 
race, 
Ben 
Flanagan was in second place 
and on the move.
Trailing pre-meet favorite 
Vincent Kiprop of Alabama, 
the fifth-year senior on the 
Michigan men’s track and 
field team found an extra 
gear. He began to accelerate, 
narrowing the gap with each 
stride.
With just 10 meters to go, 
Flanagan 
overtook 
Kiprop, 
and he held on to win the race 
by 0.46 seconds, completing 
the race in 28:34.54.
After beginning the race as 
the No. 23 seed in a 24-man 
field, he was the national 
champion.
And 
the 
first 
thing 
he 
wanted to do was see his mom.
“As soon as I crossed the 
finish line, the first thing that 
crossed my mind was I was 
like, ‘Oh my gosh, I want to 
share this moment with my 
mom so bad,’ ” Flanagan said 
in a conference call Thursday.
“She gets so nervous for 
these races and having her here 
to watch that performance and 
obviously my dad and my uncle 
as well, meant so much to me. 
But that was the first thing I 
thought about as soon as the 
race was over. I was like, ‘I 
gotta go see my mom, because 
I know how much she’s gonna 
enjoy this moment and I really 
want to share it with her.’ ”
A gritty race from Flanagan 
was a fitting end to a collegiate 
career riddled with adversity. 
He shattered his previous 
personal-best 
time 
by 
39 
seconds.
“Obviously this was a huge 
breakthrough race for me, 
and I’m so ecstatic about it,” 
Flanagan said. “But going into 
the race, I knew that I really 
did believe I had a shot at it… 
It was just an amazing day.”
Flanagan’s 
run 
to 
the 
national title was long — 
longer than he ever would 
have imagined. After a strong 
2016 season that culminated 
in 14th place at the NCAA 
Outdoor 
Championships 
in 
the 10,000-meter, he found 
himself battling through a foot 
injury the following fall. Then 
he was diagnosed with a sacral 
stress fracture in his back, and 
his hopes of improving on his 

2016 placing were dashed.
But 
he 
kept 
working, 
fighting 
to 
stay 
positive 
throughout his rehab and find 
his way back onto the track. It 
paid off, and he now embodies 
Bo 
Schembechler’s 
iconic 
quote, “Those who stay will be 
champions.”
“In those moments when 
things are at their toughest, 
at the peak of the injury when 
you don’t really know what 
the future holds, and things 
are a little bit uncertain, 
you’ve just gotta take those 
small victories and those just 
kind of start to snowball on 
each other,” Flanagan said. 
“Luckily, things really started 
to come around this season.”
Things 
started 
coming 
around when Flanagan began 
his postseason campaign with 
a Big Ten title in the 10,000-
meter — his second title in 
three years in the event after 
earning his first in 2016. He 
shaved more than a minute 
off that Big Ten-winning time 
at the NCAA East Region 
preliminaries — going from 
30:23.86 to 29:17.24 — to place 
third and set up his chance at 
a national title.
“I 
think 
the 
biggest 
takeaway 
I 
had 
from 
my 
injuries is that you just can’t 
take any moment for granted,” 
Flanagan said. “That was kind 
of my mentality this entire 
season after the setbacks and 
the 
adversity 
and 
coming 
back, and then having another 
setback.
“At Big Tens it felt great, 
regionals it felt even better, 
and I just went into every 
single race like, ‘You know 
what, we’ve got another day, 
the body’s cooperating again, 
just enjoy the moment and 
have fun with it.’ And coming 
into nationals, still feeling 
healthy and ready to roll, I 
just really wanted to take 
advantage of the opportunity 
and have as much fun and 
enjoy the moment.”
***
Several 
of 
Flanagan’s 
teammates joined him at the 
NCAA outdoor championships 
— 
fifth-year 
senior 
Grant 
Cartwright, 
junior 
Andrew 
Liskowitz, 
junior 
Taylor 
McLaughlin, 
and 
redshirt 
sophomore Brandon Piwinski.
Cartwright and Liskowitz 
both 
competed 
in 
the 
shotput, 
placing 
11th 
and 
14th, respectively. Cartwright 

tossed a career-best 19.61m 
in the semifinals but missed 
qualifying for the final by just 
two placings.
“He’s always been a leader. 
He’s always come through in 
the clutch situations like 90% 
of the time and he sure did it 
in this championship phase 
of the season,” said Michigan 
coach 
Jerry 
Clayton. 
“To 
perform 
well 
at 
the 
Big 
Tens, then come back to the 
preliminary rounds with a 
personal best, and then come 
here to the NCAA meet with 
another personal best. … That 
mark would have probably 
made 
the 
final 
any 
year 
previous to this.”
Piwinski battled wind and 
rain in his high jump final and 
finished in a three-way tie for 
18th, earning him honorable 
mention All-American honors.
“Brandon coming in just 
getting to the meet was quite an 
accomplishment with what he 
did at the preliminary round,” 
Clayton said. “Then coming in 
here competing under pretty 
adverse conditions with the 
rain, I thought he did a good 
job. … I feel that he competed 
well under those conditions 
and that’s all you could ask 
and that’s the best he could 
do.”
McLaughlin placed second 
in the semifinal of the 400-
meter hurdles to qualify for 
the final, then took more than 
half a second off his qualifying 
time to place fifth with a time 
of 49:59 — his career-best time 
in an NCAA championship.
Flanagan’s 
win 
and 
McLaughlin’s placing earned 
the Wolverines a total of 14 
points toward the team title 
— placing them 20th out of 69 
teams.
***
More than 12 hours after 
winning his title, Flanagan 
could 
not 
contain 
his 
excitement over the result.
“It was awesome to finish 
my collegiate career in the 
best way I could ever imagine, 
I’m so excited about that,” 
Flanagan 
said. 
“(NCAA 
competition) has been such 
a high priority for me the 
past five years, my dedication 
to Michigan’s program and 
doing everything I could to 
represent the Michigan block 
‘M’ to the best of my abilities.”
And there’s no better way to 
represent the block ‘M’ than 
by winning a national title.
