Donald Trump Jr. 
tweets out proof 
of meeting with 
Russian official 
during campaign

The 
Michigan 
Daily 

administered a survey to 1,000 
randomly selected respondents 
at the University of Michigan 
campus. 
There 
were 
135 

respondents. 

The following article includes 

data collected in this survey, 
particularly 
with 
to 
student 

reactions to the Trump presidency 
and possible connections to the 
Russian government. 

“You need to think about it from 

the standpoint of Republicans 
in Congress right now, this is 
a president whose supporters 
still really admire him,” Charles 
Shipan, University of Michigan 
Professor of Social Science, said. 
“If they take on the president of 
their own party, they, at this point, 
need to worry about what they’ll 
impede for their political careers.”

On July 7, President Donald 

Trump 
met 
with 
Russian 

President 
Vladimir 
Putin 
to 

discuss U.S. elections and Syria — 
a relationship met with criticism 
for those who worry about the 

foreign government influencing 
United States policies. 

This week, his son has tweeted 

out proof of meeting with Russia 
in order to find incriminating 
evidence on former Democratic 
candidate Hillary Clinton. 

In the Michigan Daily survey, 

approximately 79.21 percent of 
students responded that they 
disapprove of Trump’s actions 
thus far by selecting either a 1 
(being not at all) or 2 on a scale 
of 1 to 5 when asked whether 
they 
approve 
of 
Trump’s 

performance 
as 
president; 

uncertain 
was 
an 
option. 

Additionally, approximately 48.51 
percent indicated they believe 
impeachment of Trump would be 
appropriate on the same scale. 

According to Gallup, Trump’s 

approval rating from January 20 
to July 11 is 40 percent.

The U.S. - Russia situation 
In June 2016, a hacker — later 

reported to be associated with 
the state of Russia — leaked 
the 
Democratic 
National 

Committee’s research file on 
Trump. Since July 2016, the 
FBI has been investigating ties 
between Russia and the Trump 
campaign; Congress has also 
been investigating the situation. 
Allegedly, the state of Russia 
interfered in the 2016 election in 
order to benefit Trump; whether 
Trump himself was involved in 
this disturbance is unknown.

However, even prior to the 

election and the inauguration, 
Trump and his campaign were 

subjected to scrutiny due to the 
alleged ties. 

According to the Washington 

Post, Michael Flynn, director of 
the Defense Intelligence Agency 
under former President Barack 
Obama, 
served 
as 
Trump’s 

National Security Advisor for 
merely 24 days, before he was 
forced to resign under contentious 
circumstances. In December 2015, 
Flynn joined a panel discussion 
on Russia Today — a Russian 
news channel — and reportedly 
increased communications with 
Sergey 
Kislyak, 
the 
Russian 

ambassador to the United States. 
He is also known to support the 
Turkish government and Turkish 
business interests, which are tied 
to Russia. 

The FBI began investigating 

Flynn in April 2016. Attorney 
General Jeff Sessions, formerly an 
Alabama senator, is also known to 
have been in contact with Kislyak 
on multiple occasions, though he 
denies any conspiracy.

In July 2016, private Democratic 

National 
Committee 
emails 

were exposed by Wikileaks. In 
October, the directors of national 
intelligence and the Department 
of Homeland Security warned 
the country of potential Russian 
interference in the election, saying 
Russia was involved in the release 
of the emails. 

After 
the 
election, 
in 

December, 
Flynn 
and 
Jared 

Kushner, 
Trump’s 
son-in-

law and senior advisor, met

Business owners, 
students cope with 
difficulties, hoping 
for long-run returns

By CHETALI JAIN

Summer Daily News Editor

Downtown Ann Arbor has 

been a medley of bright orange 
construction barrels and torn up 
asphalt this summer as a result 
of the drastic road work being 
done in many busy downtown 
areas.

Not long after students had 

packed up their things and 
exited Ann Arbor after taking 
their finals, streets were blocked 
off and detour signs were posted 
around Catherine Street, South 
State 
Street, 
South 
Division 

Street and Fourth Avenue to 
name a few. The construction 
has impacted both students and 
local businesses.

junior 
Jessica 

Vu 
is 
currently 
living 
in 

University Towers, located at 
South 
University 
and 
South 

Forest avenues and said the 
construction has added some 
difficulties to her day-to-day 
life. Vu has a car on campus and 
revealed the roads were never of 
particular concern to her before 
the work started.

“The 
construction 
has 

complicated my commute to 
work and classes,” Vu said. “The 
loud construction has become 
my new alarm clock. I often 
wake up to it at around 7 a.m.”

Much of the work consists of 

road resurfacing and sidewalk

University researchers link mental 
illness to discrimination in Black men

Police brutality, 
mass incarceration 
among sources of 

discrimination

By ALEXA ST. JOHN
 Managing News Editor

Racial discrimination during 

one’s youth can predict long-
term 
negative 
mental 
health 

consequences 
in 
Black 
men, 

one 
University 
of 
Michigan 

researcher found. However, these 
consequences later in life differ 
between males and females.

Shervin 
Assari, 
a 
research 

investigator with the School of 
Public Health, studied data from 
679 Black youth from 1994 to 
2012, all of whom lived in Flint, 
referred to as an “economically 
disadvantaged 
urban 
area.” 

Assari found that perceived racial 
discrimination throughout that 
time later influenced psychological 
symptoms such as anxiety and 
depression, but mostly for men.

“Racial 
discrimination 
may 

contribute 
to 
mental 
health 

problems through several 
potential 
mechanisms 

including: 
1) 
heightened 

negative 
psychological 

stress response, 2) increased 
physiological stress response, 
3) hypervigilance, and 4) 
increased participation in 
unhealthy behaviors,” Assari 
wrote in his new paper.

This 
information 
has 

been 
confirmed 
through 

the National Institutes of 
Health; according to another 
study, “In the United States 
(U.S.), as in other racialized 
countries 
in 
the 
world, 

racially 
stigmatized 
and 

disenfranchised populations 
have 
worse 
health 
than 

their 
more 
advantaged 

counterparts.”

According to Assari, based on 

higher rates of discrimination 
against Black males — including 
police 
brutality 
and 
mass 

incarceration 
— 
he 
expected 

worse effects on mental health 
later in life for males than in 
females. The paper also outlined 
a number of negative stereotypes 
associated with Black men, such 
as being considered endangered, 

aggressive, 
angry 
and 
self-

destructive.

Assari 
also 
attributed 
his 

expectations to differing coping 
mechanisms 
between 
genders; 

Assari noted in his paper females 
tend to use an avoidant coping 
mechanism while males are more 
confrontational. In a previous 
study, Assari noted differences in 
vulnerability and susceptibility to 
stressors between the genders as 
well.

“Those who get exposed to more 

discrimination over time become 
more depressed and more anxious 
one decade later when they are 
young … but particularly if they are 
male,” Assari said.

Females 
have 
more 
social 

support, express emotions and 
hold conversations about their 
problems, 
Assari 
said, 
while 

masculinity tends to be a barrier 
for males wanting to reach out and 
seek help.

“Women tend to have access to 

social support and use it better,” 
Assari said. “Discrimination is 
worse in the presence of high 
masculinity.”

Additionally, 
males 
and 

females are sensitive to different 
types of discrimination; males 
are more sensitive to fear-based 
discrimination, while females are 
more sensitive to being ignored or 
disregarded in a discriminating 
manner.

Nonetheless, Black men make up 

the group least likely to seek mental 
health care, Assari said, stemming 
from a consistent social lack of 
knowledge about this community 

and a stigma surrounding the 
current health care system.

Daniel 
Lee, 
a 
postdoctoral 

student working at the Prevention 
Research Center in the Public 
Health School specifically working 
on the Flint Adolescent Study data 
used in Assari’s research, wrote in 
an email interview that because 
of this data, mental health and 
services to treat mental illness 
need to become priorities in 
communities.

“This may involve dismantling 

negative attitudes and stigma 
around mental illness and mental 
health care,” Lee wrote. “Anti-
stigma programs such as the 
National Alliance for the Mentally 
Ill may play a vital role in this 
process. A study actually found 
that people of color (especially 
males) are apprehensive about 
seeking mental health care due to 
stigma, but that they still want to 
seek out help in some form.” 

Lee 
also 
stressed 
concern 

for institutional barriers such 
as affordability and insurance 
coverage, as well as the need for 
mental health care to be culturally 
tailored.

“Ethnic 
and 
racial 
groups 

possess unique cultural practices, 
traditions, 
and 
beliefs,” 
Lee 

wrote. “It is, therefore, crucial 
that mental health professionals 
integrate key cultural elements 
into their clinical assessment, case 
conceptualization, and treatment 
plan.”

Democratic candidates for Michigan governor and U.S. 
representative speak at a campaign stop in Bloomfield

Abdul El-Sayed, 
Haley Stevens 
discuss auto 

industry, public 

health issues

By NISA KHAN

Summer Editor in Chief

A crowd of 50 gathered in the 

Bloomfield 
Township 
Public 

Library to hear from guberna-
torial candidate Abdul El-Sayed 
and Haley Stevens, the Demo-
cratic candidate for Congress in 
the 11th Congressional District.

Hosted by the Birmingham-

Bloomfield 
Democratic 
Club 

on Monday night, the speakers 
spent the meeting introducing 
themselves and their campaign 

before taking questions from 
the audience.

Stevens is an Oakland County 

local who served in the previous 
Obama administration. She was 
the chief of staff on the Auto 
Task Force for the U.S. Trea-
sury Department — this team 
was delegated the task to work 
on the auto industry in Detroit. 
She also created the first online 
training program for digital 
manufacturing.

“This is a moment for all of 

us,” she said, stating elected 
officials were not steering the 
country in the direction every-
one 
was 
comfortable 
with. 

“Because there is something 
happening in Washington that 
is disconnected from the rest of 
us.”

Stevens was asked on her 

positions 
on 
certain 
issues 

and her plans to work with the 
opposition party. Along with 
supporting Medicaid and rec-
ognizing the gerrymandering-

faults in Michigan, she said it 
was imperative that Michigan 
had younger representatives in 
Congress that could work with 
Republicans.

She further explained the 

average age of a Michigan rep-
resentative was in their 60s and 
they needed fresh, new voices.

After Stevens, El-Sayed, who 

began canvassing in Ann Arbor 
on Sunday, began explaining 
his background the audience — 
beginning with his parents back 
in Egypt coming to the United 
States and feeling like they 
belonged in this country.

He then explained the crux 

of his interest, which is the 
politics of health. He explained 
most sickness and life expectan-
cy comes from the politics side 
rather than the biological side; 
it is politics that affect the dif-
ferences of health care coverage 
and sickness between Detroit 
and Bloomfield Hills.

He emphasized Detroit had

plenty of hospitals; public health 
was preventing care, and hospi-
tals were too meddled in bureau-
cracy.

Despite his young age, El-Sayed 

said he would be a fit for gover-
nor with his expertise in public 
health, following Michigan’s han-
dling of the Flint water crisis.

El-Sayed then answered ques-

tions as well.

An 
audience 
member 
com-

mended El-Sayed for being a Mus-
lim man running during “Trump’s 
era.” While El-Sayed thanked her, 
he reminded the audience Trump 
won by a small margin and “this 
country is still our country.”

Over half of the audience were 

newcomers 
to 
the 
Democrat-

ic Club, ignited by the current 
Trump presidency.

Audience members, such as 

Bloomfield Hills residents Debo-
rah Bernstein-Seagal and Brian 
Kott, were more familiar with 
Haley Stevens and came to hear 
her talk.

“My son went to high school 

(Seaholm) with her,” Bernstein-
Seagal said.

“We were recently reintro-

duced to her as a potential candi-
date, and we think it is important 
to elect Democrats in the current 
environment,” Kott said.

El-Sayed was a new face to 

many as well, who heard him for 
the first time that night.

Kott 
said 
while 
he 
was 

impressed by El-Sayed, his unfa-
miliarity 
to 
some 
Michigan 

residents may leave him at an dis-
advantage with the other, well-
known Democrat gubernatorial 
candidate Gretchen Whitmer. 

“I would was also introduced 

to Dr. El-Sayed,” he said. “A very 
impressive man … And I think his 
problem is name recognition and 
the fact that Gretchen Whitmer 
is known fixture and a minor-
ity leader of the House and all of 
those other things. He’s certainly 
qualified and deserves to have a 
voice in our current society.”

with 
Kislyak 
to 
establish 

communications between the 
Trump 
administration 
and 

Russia, reportedly to discuss 
issues related to Syria. The FBI 
believed the meeting included 
talk of easing sanction against 
Russia in exchange for financial 
assistance. 
Meanwhile, 
at 

the same time, the Obama 
administration 
increased 

sanctions against Russia in 
response 
to 
the 
supposed 

election interference. 

U.S. 
intelligence 
agencies 

released a report to explain 
why they believe Russia was 
involved in the hacking effort. 
FBI Director James Comey 
assured Trump that he was not 
personally under investigation. 
In fact, on different occasions 
in February, March and April, 
Comey 
assured 
Trump 
he 

was 
not 
personally 
being 

investigated.

After the inauguration, the 

FBI interviewed Flynn about 
his December meeting with 
Kislyak, and his statements 
differed 
from 
other 
public 

statements, sparking concern 

Russia 
could 
compromise 

Flynn by threatening to leak 
information. 

In March, for the first time, 

Comey announced to the House 
Intelligence 
Committee 
that 

there 
was 
an 
investigation 

occurring 
on 
the 
Russian 

hacking and links to the Trump 
campaign. 

In 
May, 
Comey 
testified 

at 
a 
congressional 
hearing 

and was fired by Trump; he 
never 
publicly 
stated 
that 

Trump himself wasn’t under 
investigation, 
which 
the 

president had asked him to do. 
Former FBI Director Robert 
Mueler then was appointed 
special counsel to oversee the 
FBI’s investigation. 

According to Bill Moyers, in 

June, Comey testified before the 
Senate Intelligence Committee 
and said he believed he was fired 
because of the investigation.

“It’s my judgment that I was 

fired because of the Russia 
investigation,” Comey said. “I 
was fired in some way to change, 
or the endeavor was to change, 
the way the Russia investigation 
was being conducted.”

OPINION

L

ate one night when I was five 
years old, unable to sleep, I 
wandered out of my bedroom 

to find my mom watching TV in our 
living room. Despite her futile protests 
for me to go back to bed, I sat with 
her on the couch to see what she was 
watching. The grainy images from our 
TV were then quickly etched into my 
memory as I watched military planes 
taking off and missiles being 
launched. Turning to my mom, 
I asked what was happening, 
and as best as she could with a 
sad expression on her face, she 
said that “we” were going to 
war.

My mom and I were watching 

what I later found out to be the 
first images of the U.S. invasion 
of Afghanistan in late 2001. I 
was five years old that night 
watching our nation deploy 
thousands of soldiers to that 
faraway country.

And I am now 21 — and yet 

again, I am watching as our 
country proceeds to deploy 
thousands of more soldiers, 
some 
younger 
than 
myself, 

to Afghanistan in order to 
continue a war that has been 
raging for nearly 16 years.

And that is why I question if 

“we” are still going to war? 

Because 
in 
that 
16-year 

expanse, 
many 
Americans, 

myself included, never felt like 
the country was truly in a state 
of war. There was no period of 
rationing for fuel, no utilization 
of factories to build new tanks 
and military equipment. During 
this time, there was no draft to 
fill the ranks of our military, no 
push in our education and state 
departments to teach Arabic 
or 
Afghani 
Pashtun 
within 

our schools. And there were 
no new taxes meant explicitly 
to finance both the war and 
to comfort the pain caused to 
veterans and their families.

Essentially, unless you or 

your 
family 
member 
were 

enlisted within the military — 
life in America was completely 
normal. 
Because 
to 
us 
as 

Americans, war as seen through 
our TVs and smartphones is 
perfectly normal.

Since the Cold War, we have 

had our military engaged in a 
near constant state of warfare 
that seems to be increasing in 
magnitude across the globe. 
From Vietnam to Grenada, to 
Somalia and now Syria — our 
military being in combat is 
just a part of present reality. 
It is just the accepted standard 
that in some distant part of the 
world, U.S. soldiers are fighting 
and dying. The drone strikes 
that kill innocent civilians are 
normal. The deaths of special 
forces 
soldiers 
are 
normal. 

And now, the increase in troop 
deployments in Afghanistan, 
Syria and Iraq have become 
normal.

As 
detailed 
in 
Rachel 

Maddow’s 
excellent 
book 

“Drift,” a dramatic detachment 
occurred between the American 
public and the U.S. military in 
which the “country” stopped 
going to war, but the military 
still did.

This 
began 
during 
and 

especially 
after 
the 
war 
in 

Vietnam. Lack of public support 
for the war culminated in a 
detachment of the military from 
the general public. Congressional 
approvals for military operations 
became 
difficult 
to 
attain 

due to the lack of support for 
sending 
more 
Americans 
to 

Vietnam. Therefore, subverting 
the standard protocol for war 
became 
more 
common 
for 

the executive branch and the 
Pentagon. For example, the War 
Powers Act has allegedly been 
violated multiple times with no 

resulting legal action against 
the executive office. War has 
essentially 
become 
easier 
to 

conduct.

And throughout the entire 

process, the American public 
has 
been 
almost 
unaffected 

by the wars raged in different 
parts of the world. No rationing 
ever occurred, no new taxes 
were levied, no transformation 
occurred in our public education 
to train a new generation to 
deal with terrorism and foreign 
policy — instead, from our living 
rooms, we sat back and watched 
the planes and rockets fly.

Desensitized to the violence, 

our country has further divided 
into the normalization of the 
constant 
state 
of 
warfare, 

reaching a point in which it is 
almost satirical, with Fox News 
airing clips of bombs being 
dropped to the tune of patriotic 
country music. Why do we even 
ask how Roman citizens could 
watch gladiators slaughter each 
other in the arena?

Our lack of empathy and 

understanding 
toward 
both 

veterans and victims of war 
is displayed with our current 
foreign policy. Military options 
are 
always 
on 
the 
table, 

often 
preferred 
over 
other 

alternatives due to our true 
lack of understanding of actual 
consequences.

The true consequences of 

this normalization of warfare 
are barbaric and depressing. 
And the anguish is experienced 
not only by the thousands of 
veterans and families who lost 
a loved one in combat — but the 
innocent civilians caught in the 
hell that becomes their homes. 
As we watch the escalating 
conflicts going on a world away 
— thousands upon thousands of

A

t the start of this summer 
living at home, one of my 
goals was to ride my bike 

eight miles to and from work, 
through 
the 
neighborhoods 

between my suburb and the 
downtown 
Columbus 
area. 

At first, I was afraid on the 
commute to my restaurant job 
— I’m a woman with a fairly 
small frame, alone, wearing 
a backpack, riding a visibly 
fancy road bike. I’m not quite 
comfortable enough with my 
bike to make repairs if something 
happened, and I was scared to 
be stranded, alone, female and 
carrying precious cargo as I was 
in an unfamiliar area of town. I 
wanted to stop relying on my car 
— and gasoline — to get to work, 
but I was having trouble bucking 
up the courage.

As the summer went on, 

though, I grew tired of paying 
for parking meters at work, and I 
needed the exercise biking gave 
me. In the beginning of June, I 
did a practice ride to and from 
the restaurant one afternoon 
after I got off work and have 
been commuting via bike three 
times per week ever since.

Lucky for me, I get the opening 

shift a lot. At a breakfast and 
lunch place, this means I have 
to be there by six, which means 
I have to leave my house at 5:30 
a.m. Just before dawn, hardly 
anyone is out. Bexley and the 
surrounding areas are serene 
and sparsely populated, and I 
get to see the sun go up and the 
streetlights turn off.

I go from my house down side 

streets between average-sized 
houses that grow into mansions 
as I move further westward. 
Between the trees that line the 
streets, birds fly freely and low 
to the ground across my path, 
not expecting humans to be out 
and moving so quickly at such 
an early hour. Their warning 
cries to one another reach my 
ears from both sides as I barrel 
toward 
the 
bike 
trail 
that 

borders Wolfe Park, the site of 
ancient Adena tribe settlements 
I wrote about before.

When the gridded streets of 

Bexley open to the curved trail 
between the grassy park and 
Alum Creek, I can see where the 
fog has settled just above the 
ground, and above the treeline, 
dawn explodes across the sky. 
I wonder if Native American 
inhabitants were ever up at this 
hour, either to begin the day’s 
work or because a small child 
woke them for breakfast. But 
I only ever catch a glimpse of 
all this, because I have to pay 
attention to where I’m steering.

I never have any worries riding 

my bike through Bexley. I know 
those streets are meticulously 
guarded by the Bexley Police 
Department, and recreational 
road bikers and even commuters 
aren’t a rarity in that area — 
mostly because lots of people 
who live in Bexley can afford 
to buy and maintain the light, 
high-speed bikes that are most 
desirable for such activities.

The bike path follows Alum 

Creek, then crosses over a 
newly rebuilt bridge out of 
the Bexley area and into the 
Franklin Park neighborhood. 
On the other side of the creek, 
there’s a bench along the path. 
I suspected people may sleep 
there sometimes, but I had 
ridden my bike to work so many 
times without seeing anyone 
there that I’d forgotten my 
suspicions.

One morning, however, I 

rode across the bridge and was 
distracted, trying to commit 
to memory the image of a 
particularly beautiful sunrise 
over Wolfe Park. I rode under 
the bridge’s final arch and BAM 
— there was a person right 
in front of me. He was a man, 
asleep, with a couple plastic 
shopping 
bags 
holding 
his 

possessions resting below the 
wooden boards of the bench.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

N

early 
all 
last 
year, 

every time I would go 
on Facebook and scroll 

through my newsfeed, I would see 
dozens of articles I wanted to read. 
But as someone who is generally 
too busy for their own good, I often 
had to save articles for later. So, 99 
percent of the time, I saved the link 
to the article in a note-taking app 
on my computer. Finally, this year, 
I sat down, and I started to clicking 
through my list of nearly 150 articles 
that I had been meaning to read. 
And as overwhelming as it seemed 
in the moment, I quickly realized 
something as I browsed through the 
articles. 

After reading the first twenty or so 

articles, I began to recognize the title 
or the cover art as that of an article 
I’d already read. And even when the 
title and cover art didn’t remind me 
I’d read the article, the contents of it 
would sound vaguely familiar, and 
I would eventually remember I’d 
already read that one. I put two and 
two together and realized that as the 
year had gone by, many of the same 
articles that I saw and had saved to 
read popped up again, months later, 
when I’d forgotten about them, and, 
again intrigued (after all, it would be 
the same article), I would save it to 
read.

Last semester at the Daily, the 

staff talked extensively about how to 
increase our publication’s presence 
online, and one particular topic 
of discussion has still stuck with 
me: Facebook and how its newest 
algorithm made it so users will only 
see posts that — based on likes and 
interactions with accounts, articles 
and pages — Facebook believed they 
would be interested in.

While it can be nice not to have to 

sift through every single post from 
each one of my Facebook friends 
— especially when it had been so 
long that I only recognized some 
my Facebook friends by name — 
seeing first-hand how Facebook 
not only filtered profile pictures, 
statuses and cover photos, but 
also 
articles, 
was 
especially 

alarming to me. Equally alarming 
is that the majority of Americans 
are getting their news from social 
media, therefore the algorithms 
that determine what we see are 
increasingly important.

While my Twitter presence is 

dismal at best, I have seen how 
Twitter can have the same effect. 
In March 2016, Twitter launched 
a new algorithm. Like Facebook, 
instead of showing posts from all 
the people you follow, you would 

now only see certain tweets based 
on what the algorithm thought were 
your preferences. And even though 
there 
was 
significant 
backlash 

against the switch to an algorithmic 
timeline, prompting Twitter to 
provide users the option to opt out of 
the new algorithm in favor of the old 
timeline where you saw every post 
in chronological order, only about 
two percent of users opted out and 
took the time to actively change the 
settings back to the old version.

As technology has become more 

innovative and complex, so have 
programs that analyze what we 
“like” on Facebook, what we read, 
what we listen to, the places we shop 
online and the searches we put into 
Google. Though tailoring content 
can be useful at times, it can also be 
problematic.

Because of these algorithms, we 

are seeing more of the same type of 
articles and same type of posts, and 
we aren’t so much exposing ourselves 
to new ideas or opinions. As I wrote 
about in my most recent column, 
opinions won’t always change, but 
if we never hear the other side, we 
will never have the opportunity to 
challenge our opinions. We won’t 
have that chance to think and expand 
our worldview. With algorithms that 
show us what it thinks we want to 
see, it’s helping to vastly shrink our 
world, not encouraging exploration 
and openness, which I argue is 
crucial in any society.

Politics aside, though, the issue of 

tailored content based on algorithms 
and computer programs is also 
problematic because they can help, 
even subtly, reinforce stereotypes.

Recently, MLB.TV had a half-off 

discount for Fathers Day, but, at least 
when it comes down to the playoffs 
and postseason, women account for 
nearly one-third of those who watch 
sports such as baseball, basketball 
and football, to name only a few, so 
why not a Mothers Day discount?

Furthermore, 
even 
though 

networks 
almost 
always 
have 

monetary gain as a main concern, 
by assuming X or Y parties won’t be 
as interested, they could be missing 
out on a large market (I know the 
Father’s Day discount enticed me to 
purchase the rest of the MLB season 
even though I never would have for 
the regular price).

And though less pressing an issue, 

with tailored content, companies 
and analysts assume people won’t 
find something interesting they 
previously may not have thought 
much about. Yeah, I like what I like, 
but that doesn’t mean I won’t be open 

to new content. That doesn’t mean it 
will be a surefire indicator of what I 
will like in the future.

Netflix, for example, has a new 

feature where it tells users, based on 
previously watched movies and TV 
shows, the percent “match” a movie 
or show is for you. I recently saw 
Lee Daniels’ “The Butler,” which 
Netflix told me was a 70 percent 
match, but it was one of my favorite 
movies I’ve seen this year. In fact, 
two of my favorite movies could not 
be more opposite each other. But 
had I listened to an algorithm or a 
matching program, I may never have 
seen them.

In fact, everyone from movie 

producers 
to 
car 
companies, 

journalists to sports teams, lose 
out when they are always trying 
to predict which audiences will be 
most likely to be interested in their 
content. I’m not saying trying to place 
Heineken ads on Disney Channel is a 
good idea or putting an article about 
the stock market on an eleven-year-
old’s Facebook page makes sense, 
but it wouldn’t hurt for everyone to 
expand and experiment and think 
outside the box that says X or Y won’t 
find the article, product or movie 
interesting. 

In the last year, The New York 

Times 
morning 
briefings 
have 

started to include a section on 
partisan articles, to try to bridge a 
gap between people on different 
sides of the aisles. Companies and 
newspapers need to do what the 
Times is doing. They need to rethink 
how and where they disseminate 
information, what articles they 
should provide that might help them 
see and understand other side of the 
aisle, how to promote a movie that 
Netflix’s matching system would 
otherwise say they wouldn’t like or 
how to play with a potential market 
for a product that analysts said people 
who watch that TV channel wouldn’t 
be interested in.

As for people like me who aren’t 

making the advertising decisions or 
who can’t control the algorithms, 
we should take the initiative to read 
articles that aren’t just the first ones 
to pop up on Facebook or Twitter, 
seek out information on topics we 
wouldn’t think we’d be interested 
in, watch movies regardless of the 
fact that they were or were not 
recommended to us, branch out and 
try new products. It can be fun, and 
not to mention important, to try new 
things.

Expand your horizons

H

ow do we know the existence 
of something? For most, we 
use one or more of our five 

senses. For example, we know a car 
exists because we can see or hear it. 
We know an apple exists because we 
can see the apple and taste it. This is 
one of the basic ideas of metaphysics, 
yet we run into a problem when we 
ponder the existence of something 
without the use of our sense, such 
as atoms. How do we know that 
atoms exist? According to my senses, 
I cannot see, hear, taste nor feel 
atoms, yet I “know”they exist. At its 
cornerstone, when we postulate the 
existence of atoms, we can suddenly 
explain a lot about the world. We can 
describe how we as humans are built, 
why certain reactions occur and how 
certain materials are better for our 
technology than others. The basis, as 
you might notice, is that society uses 
atomic theory to explain how our 
world exists. However, as explained 
by Socratic metaphysics, we search 
not simply for an explanation, but for 
the best explanation. 

Metaphysics, 
as 
much 
as 
it 

distinguishes itself from science, is an 
area of philosophy I keep returning 
to in my scientific debates. As a 
person who does extensive research 
in the neurolinguistics laboratory at 
the University of Michigan, studies 
neuroscience and is usually surrounded 
by “science activities” throughout my 
day, I have become a full supporter of 
the scientific process. Yet, on a daily 
basis, I am inundated with news of 
scientific doubt, be it climate change, 
evolution or vaccines. Why does this 
doubt occur? Will it help to increase 
science education? If we should, how 
do we do so? Is scientific doubt really 
the problem? Perhaps our problem as a 
nation is rooted elsewhere.

As stated in Socratic metaphysics, 

we cannot use our senses to 
determine the existence of climate 
change, evolution or vaccines. We can 
do research and posit an explanation 
for the increase of carbon in the 
atmosphere, the breaking of ice caps 
or how homo sapiens came to be. 
Through peer review and replicated 
studies, we, as a society, come to the 
best explanation of these issues. Even 
though we may agree on this process, 
doubt is inherently human, especially 
of something that is not confirmed by 
our senses. Many science skeptics, 
as well as contributors and analysts 
on the news, say this scientific doubt 
has simply gone awry in our country; 
however, I propose it is more than 
that: at its core, science skepticism 
isn’t based in doubt, it is often based 
on how we identify ourselves.

Our identities, especially today, 

are often correlated with a political 
party, a religion and many other 
“cultural identities.” We as humans 
construct our societies and belief 
systems based on emotions, so it 
should be no surprise that emotional 
attachment to scientific research can 
influence the way one approaches 
climate 
change, 
evolution 
or 

vaccines. Research done at Yale Law 
School on cultural cognition shows 
that a layperson’s belief in science 
does not reflect the knowledge that 
the person possesses — on evolution, 
for instance. Evidently, knowledge 
of science in this country does not 
always correlate to scientific trust. 
That means a significant portion 
of those who believe in climate 
change don’t understand the basics 
of the science. The problem isn’t 
the inherent doubt, it’s our society’s 
inability to remove identity from 
science.

Climate change, evolution and 

vaccines have large swaths of 
doubters because of the conflict 
the theories pose to an individual’s 
emotions and belief systems. In order 
to fix this, scientists and educators 
need to become more creative in their 
educational endeavors. We, as a diverse 
society with many perspectives, must 
extricate the science from identity. 
Those who support climate change 
theory do so because, in many cases, it 
supports his or her identity. The same 
can be said for those who doubt it. 
Association with a particular political 
party, a religion and other emotionally-
charged 
identifiers 
creates 
the 

misunderstanding surrounding the 
science, not the science itself. Removing 
science from these markers is a possible 
way we can gain a consensus on 
scientific evidence supporting climate 
change. This has begun in many 
schools that teach genetics, where 
evolution is approached but freed 
from a belief system. This is the next 
crucial step needed in climate change 
education to nonscientists.

Though 
science 
education, 

as well as exposure to scientific 
literature, can be improved in our 
schools as well, this, in my view, 
is not the root of science mistrust. 
We must find a way to remove the 
stigmatism surrounding science by 
introspectively recognizing the role 
our identities play in influencing 
policy. Only then, we can come to a 
consensus on the best explanations 
for our global problems.

SONY PICTURES 

Tom Holland stars as Spider-Man

“Spider-Man: 
Homecoming” 

marks 
the 
second 
reboot 
of 

everyone’s favorite webslinger, this 
one within the Marvel Cinematic 
Universe in the aftermath of the 
dumpster-fire-inside-a-trainwreck 
that was 2014’s “The Amazing 
Spider-Man 2.” The efforts of 
Hollywood to get another strong 
Spider-franchise off the ground 
speaks not only to the obvious 
money-making 
capabilities 
of 

the character, but to his ability to 
resonate with audiences after 50 
years since his first appearance. 
There’s a simple reason for that: 
Peter Parker is not a billionaire, 
a prince or an alien. He’s an 
ordinary guy whose greatest trials 
are often finding the balance 
between heroism and day-to-day 
struggles like jobs, friendships and 
romance. He’s one of us. And for 
the first time since Sam Raimi’s 
“Spiderman 2” way back in 2004, it 
seems we finally have a movie that 
understands that.

So much of what “Homecoming” 

does well comes down to two 
things: the script and Tom Holland 
(“The Lost City of Z”). Featuring 
no fewer than six credited writers, 
the former blends classic high 
school comedy and all the high-
flying superheroics you’d probably 
expect. The resultant tone would 
have been pleasant enough to 
sustain the movie, but the script’s 
greatest strength comes from its 
function as a stealth origin story 
for its title character.

To clarify, by the time the story 

begins, Peter has already been 
doing whatever a spider can for 
about eight months. Despite this, 
“Homecoming” 
feels 
like 
the 

beginning of Spider-Man proper, as 
Peter begins to reflect on his future 
and what a life as an Avenger would 
mean. We don’t see the radioactive 
spider or Uncle Ben. Instead, we 
watch Peter come to grips with his 

dual identity and learn to listen to 
his most heroic instincts, a theme 
that audiences young and old will 
be able to relate to.

Holland, on the other hand, 

turns in a terrific performance as 
what may be the best Spider-Man 
yet. Spidey’s relatability is his 
lifeblood, but nearly as important 
is his youthful exuberance and 
humor. 
Holland 
nails 
both. 

Whatever the moment calls for, 
whether it’s a well-timed quip or 
tearful confession to Aunt May 
(Marisa Tomei, “The Big Short”), 
there’s never a moment that doesn’t 
feel real. As silly as it sounds, 
if a high schooler were given 
superpowers, this is probably what 
it would look like.

The rest of the cast is accordingly 

sound. Tomei doesn’t get as much 
screen time as her counterparts, but 
she still gets the funniest moment of 
the entire film. Robert Downey Jr. 

(“The Judge”) falls easily into the 
mentor role, and the relationship 
that develops between Tony Stark 
and Peter is yet another high point. 
Still, the highlight of the supporting 
players is without a doubt Michael 
Keaton 
(“Birdman”) 
as 
Adrian 

Toomes, who ranks as one of the 
most gripping villains the MCU 
has offered up. Unlike other MCU 
villains, time is actually spent 
developing Toomes’s motivation. 
He feels like a fleshed-out character, 
one whose fury is understandable 
but who is nevertheless terrifying, 
especially in the scenes he shares 
with Spider-Man.

If “Homecoming” does have one 

glaring weakness, it’s that the action 
is pretty weak. The argument could 
be made that this is due to Peter 
still learning his powers, but even 
putting that aside the direction from 
Jon Watts (“Cop Car”) lacks the life 
on display in other scenes. There’s 
nothing too inventive or exciting 
about any of it, and it lacks any sort 
of visual flair. Ironically, the action 
scenes wind up being the most 
boring bits of the movie.

But the weak action aside, 

“Homecoming” 
brings 
Spider-

Man back into the Marvel fold in 
perhaps the best way fans could 
have hoped for. It goes small where 
other interpretations have gone 
big, setting him up as a street-level 
hero whose problems and failures 
feel more realistic because they’re 
our problems. When he triumphs, 
it gives us hope that we can do the 
same. That’s what makes Spider-
Man one of the greatest superheroes 
of all time, and understanding that 
is 
“Homecoming”’s 
greatest 

success.

HAIM pays off

It’s been awhile since we’ve 

last heard from HAIM, the 
LA-based 
indie-pop 
band 

comprised 
of 
three 
San 

Fernando sisters. Their debut 
garnered critical success and, 
with a co-sign by the industry 
queen herself (Taylor Swift™), 
HAIM accumulated tremendous 
momentum. But after a short 
tour for their full-length debut, 
the band grew quiet. Over the 
course of 2016, HAIM featured 
on a Calvin Harris track and 
occasionally hosted their own 
Beats 1 show, but no new music. 
For a new band to gain so much 
buzz and go silent for the next 
three years, it was easy to forget 
about them. With Something to 
Tell You, HAIM reminds fans 
that they have a lot to say — and 
you should be listening.

Distilled, 
Something 
to 

Tell You hits on every point 
discussed from the beginning to 
the end of a rocky relationship. 
On 
the 
upbeat 

“Ready For You,” 
the sisters recall 
a 
casual 
lover, 

wishing they could 
go back and try to 
make things more 
serious. “Little of 
Your Love” pleads 
a partner to meet 
the girls halfway and offer 
them a glimpse of reciprocated 
feelings. With “Walking Away,” 
the pop-iest standout, HAIM 
mourns the end of a relationship 
while facing the harsh reality 
of needing to remove yourself 
from a situation that just isn’t 

working.

With Something to Tell You, 

HAIM finds the happy medium 
between progressing sonically 
as 
a 
band 
while 
remaining 

warmly familiar. Partly due to 
co-writing by Ariel Rechtshaid, 
who specializes in songs that 
straddle the border of pop and 
soul (Adele’s “When We Were 
Young” and Carly Rae Jepsen’s 
“All That”), HAIM delivers an 
album that strongly resembles 
the indie-pop roots of their debut, 
but takes notable steps towards 
experimentation. “Found It In 
Silence” features profound synth 
strings with a simple bass drum 
accompaniment — a familiar 
sound in HAIM’s discography. 
ws.

At 11 tracks, the album is the 

perfect length to keep listeners 
engaged 
without 
exhausting 

attention spans. It’s amazing 
to hear how much lead singer 
Danielle Haim’s voice has grown 
since their debut. However, unlike 
their last album, which featured 
greater vocal variety from Este 
and Alana (see “The Wire”), 

Something to Tell 
You feels more like 
Danielle and the 
Haim Sisters than 
HAIM, 
causing 

some of the tracks 
to lose depth due 
to a lack of familiar 
collaboration.

In 
retrospect, 

it’s understandable that HAIM 
took three years to gather their 
thoughts. Something to Tell You 
is extremely rich both sonically 
and lyrically and, just as Danielle 
sings on “Found It In Silence,” 
sometimes a long silence is a 
good thing.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com ARTS

An Interview with Festival 
Organizer Nick Mavodones 

Having been raised in Portland, 

Maine and having lived the bulk of 
his adult life in Burlington, Vermont, 
Nick Mavodones III is finally right 
where he belongs — or at least where 
I think he belongs — in Detroit, 
Michigan, as the general manager of 
up-and-coming venue El Club.

Located 
in 
Mexicantown, 

El Club opened in the Spring of 
2016, Mavodones being hired in 
November later that year by club-
owner 
Graeme 
Flegenheimer. 

“(Graeme) used to come to the venue 
I managed in Vermont when he was 
in middle school,” said Mavodones, 
“he ended up becoming friends with 
everyone at the venue and over the 
years we’ve just stayed in touch. He 
just called me Labor Day weekend 
and was like, ‘Hey do you think you’d 
want to move to Detroit?’ And I was 
like, ‘I don’t think so, man.’”

So what changed? Mavodones 

came out to Detroit for a couple of 
days to help with shows and check 
out the scene. After he returned to 
Vermont, Flegenheimer kept on him. 
“I talked to all my friends and I was 
like, ‘ah shit maybe I should try to do 
this.’” So two months later, the day 
after Halloween and shortly after 
his 15th job anniversary at Higher 
Ground — a music venue in South 
Burlington where he will be dearly 
missed — he hopped in his car and 
moved to Detroit.

Despite the quick turnaround, he 

was pleasantly surprised in Detroit 
when he found that he would be 
working with a couple of people 
he had previously worked with in 
Vermont. It also just so happened 
that his best friend from college had 
roomed in Portugal with one of the 
club’s other managers for a time. “I 
had a few familiar names to come 
into it. But everything’s been sweet; 
it’s been fun!”

Since his arrival in Detroit, 

Mavodones 
has 
been 
working 

on envisioning an installment of 
Waking Windows — the festival-
slash-booking-company that he runs 
with four other friends — in El Club’s 
space. Recently, the venue has hosted 
a couple small festival-like events 
which, Mavodones says, “gave us a 

little better idea about how we could 
better utilize the space.” Now, only 
eight months into Mavodones’s time 
at El Club, Waking Windows Detroit 
has become an immediate reality, 
with headliners of Mount Eerie, 
Whitney, Dâm-Funk, Moodymann 
and Car Seat Headrest as well as 20 
other acts.

Waking Windows as it is today 

originally 
began 
with 
a 
blog 

Mavodones started over 10 years ago. 
During his time at Higher Ground, 
he started putting on shows — 
“house shows, gallery shows, proper 
shows” — and his blog eventually 
metamorphosed into a booking 
promotion company. That company 
evolved into another entity and two 
years ago he and the friends who 
operate the company changed the 
name to Waking Windows. “We’ve 
done seven of them in Vermont, 
two in Portland, Maine, with the 
third one coming up in September,” 
Mavodones said. The most recent 
iteration of the festival in Vermont 
was held early May, where they 
had “185 acts over three days and 
something like 12 stages.”

But the festival didn’t start that 

big. Eight years ago, a friend of 
Mavodones’s who was involved in 
the local jazz scene put on the first 
and only “Other Music Festival,” 
a 
more 
experimental, 
weirder 

alternative to Jazzfest, which was 
happening at the same time. This 
original curator formed a band 
and moved out of town, leaving the 
festival to Mavodones and another 
friend. The two both worked at 
Monkey House at the time, a small, 
endearing bar and music venue in 
Winooski, Vermont, a city that had 
recently undergone some serious 
redevelopment. As a result, the city’s 
storefronts were mostly empty.

The next year, in putting on the 

festival, Mavodones and company 
used this emptiness to both their 
advantage as well as that of the city. 
“We talked to the realtors and we 
talked to the cities, and they were 
letting us use all these storefronts for 
free, to showcase music to get people 
to come to the town and potentially 
move in there,” he explained. This is 
where most of the idea for the name 
“Waking Windows” came from; it 
was the idea that they were literally 
waking up these empty storefronts 

for weekends at a time and hopefully 
longer. “We were taking overall 
of these empty spaces and then 
turning them into either galleries 
or performing spaces or reading 
rooms,” Mavodones said.

The other inspiration for the 

name, Mavodones noted, came 
from “a list of bands that were 
coming through the Monkey 
House, 
and 
there 
was 
one 

that had ‘walking’ in the title, 
like ‘walking something’ and 
someone thought it said ‘waking.’ 
So 
we 
were 
like, 
‘Waking 

Windows.’” The important bit, 
though, is that Waking Windows 
has always been a serious practice 
in community development, and 
will ideally continue in that same 
vein in Detroit.

I am especially hoping that 

Waking Windows will help have 
a lasting, positive impact on 
Detroit and, more specifically, 
Mexicantown 
because 
when 

the 
venue 
originally 
opened 

Flegenheimer got no insignificant 
amount 
of 
kickback 
from 

the community for being an 
agent of gentrification in their 
neighborhood. 
Their 
worries 

were legitimate, but Mavodones 
held that Flegenheimer and the 
venue as a whole has been doing 
more, especially recently, to be 
involved in the community in a 
positive way.

“Graeme maybe didn’t reach 

out to everyone he should have,” 
when 
originally 
opening 
the 

venue, Mavodones said, “but I 
think It’s always tough for folks 
coming in, that aren’t from an 
area, to gain the trust or gain 
the connections that make it 
worthwhile 
for 
everybody. 

I think there are still lots of 
conversations to be had.” Even 
now with the club’s recently 
successfully funded Kickstarter 
project — the Vernor Cafe, which 
will add another dimension of 
community to El Club with retail 
space, practice rooms and an 
additional, smaller music venue 
— there are plans to have the 
construction work done by local 
crews.

‘Hug of Thunder’ 
an album of hits

MUSIC INTERVIEW

Broken Social Scene are a rarity 

in contemporary music: They’re 
a 
supergroup 
that’s 
actually 

incredibly good. Sure, we’ve seen 
decent supergroups emerge in 
recent years, but none have been 
as influential as this Canadian 
collective. All members, including 
the brilliantly talented Kevin Drew 
and Leslie Feist, unite and combine 
creative endeavors in the most 
complementary way. BSS has had 
up to 19 people in its ensemble, and 
all contribute just 
enough 
without 

stepping 
on 
one 

another’s creativity 
and 
individuality. 

After a seven year 
hiatus, they return in 
top form.

Hug of Thunder 

comes as a surprise 
for fans who thought they would 
never hear another BSS album. 
Thankfully, those fears were put 
to rest earlier in May, though 
after a series of performances 
last year, the announcement 
wasn’t 
overwhelmingly 

surprising. Following their 2010 
release Forgiveness Rock Record, 
Hug of Thunder is a warm and 
uplifting 
addition 
to 
darker 

times. And even though their 
political leader is less orange 
and more progressive than ours, 
even Canada could use some BSS-
induced optimism that we all 
love them for.

“Sol 
Luna,” 
the 
album’s 

instrumental 
intro, 
reminds 

me a lot of “Capture the Flag,” 
the intro to their ambitious 
magnum opus You Forgot It in 
People. But whereas “Capture the 

Flag” fades gracefully into “KC 
Accidental,” immediately after 
“Sol Luna” we’re hit with a quick 
burst of energy with “Halfway 
Home.” And this sets up Hug of 
Thunder quite well, considering 
the album maintains a surging 
pace for most of its 52 minutes. 
“Halfway Home” in particular, 
however, stands out as being 
especially triumphant, a lot like 
a musical embodiment of a post-
tennis match victory celebration: 
not in-your-face but still full of 
emotion.

Yet, Hug of Thunder avoids 

the melodrama and eccentricity 

that 
basically 

launched the more 
commercially 
successful 
Montreal-based 
Arcade 
Fire. 

Unlike the (dare 
I say overrated) 
aforementioned 
Quebecois 
band, 

these Ontarians rely on their 
own songwriting abilities to fill 
a track rather than grandiose, 
pretentious 
arrangements. 

Take “Protest Song,” a neatly 
structured pop song with plenty 
of 
musical 
complexities. 
It 

features a wall of sound with 
layers of guitars and effects, 
but never feels bombastic. Not 
actually a real protest song, its 
lyrics are cryptic yet powerful. 
She sings “You’re just the latest 
in a long list of lost loves, love,” 
harrowingly cutting lyrics that 
would curse any ex into months 
of gloom. “Protest Song” delivers 
what we’ve come to expect from 
BSS and is some of their finest 
work.

Michigan Trump Republicans event draws protest

By CHETALI JAIN

Summer Daily News Editor

As 
nationwide 
censure 
of 

President Donald Trump and his 
controversial political acts rises, 
the Michigan Trump Republicans 

hoped to deflect attention from 
the criticisms and focus instead on 
rallying support for his reelection 
by holding meetings in multiple 
Michigan towns.

The Novi event, which was 

third in the group’s tour, was 
held Monday night at an IHOP 

restaurant to give Donald Trump 
supporters a chance to show 
their continued approval of the 
president and learn of ways to get 
involved with Trump Republicans.

The meeting also drew in 

members of the Metro Detroit 
Political Action Network, who 

gathered outside the IHOP to 
oppose the event taking place 
inside and garnered the support of 
drivers who honked to show their 
solidarity with the anti-Trump 
protesters.

Inside the restaurant, Meshawn 

Maddock, co-creator of Michigan 
Trump Republicans, emphasized 
the group’s goals to elect Trump 
Republicans to offices, including 
her 
husband 
Matt 
Maddock 

who is running for local state 
representative. 
She 
said 
an 

additional goal was to stand in 
opposition to Indivisible, a group 
with over 800 localized branches 
in Michigan dedicated to resisting 

Donald Trump’s agenda.

“So really, the Michigan Trump 

Republicans was formed to be 
the anti-venom for Indivisible,” 
Meshawn Maddock said. “I want 
(my husband) to have a Republican 
governor… all the way down to city 
council … that’s the way to drain 
the swamp.”

Kevin Tatulyan, Coalitions Vice 

Chair of Michigan Republican 
party, lamented the backlash the 
president faced after the campaign 
was over and encouraged attendees 
not to trust liberals or Hollywood 
but rather their own hearts.

“Look at the media: Trump says 

‘make America great again,’ they 
say, ‘Trump’s a racist,’ ” Tatulyan 
said, as the crowd clapped in 
agreement. “... is this not 100 
percent true? This is ridiculous.”

Trump has also discussed his 

low tolerance of the media and 
news outlets such as CNN. The 
Michigan 
Trump 
Republicans 

share his distaste: volunteers wore 
“Fake News Network (FNN)” 
T-shirts, Maddock mentioned that 
they don’t like press to be present 
at events and a cameraman had 
been asked to leave once before.

The president has also been 

under 
scrutiny 
regarding 
his 

alleged 
ties 
to 
the 
Russian 

government and allegations the 
Russian state interfered with the 
2016 presidential election.

Marian 
Sheridan, 
leader 
of 

the Lakes Area Tea Party, said 
the claims were far-fetched and 
unsubstantiated.

“Show 
us 
the 
evidence,” 

Sheridan said.

According to The New York 

Times, Donald Trump Jr. had 
received an email saying that 
damaging information regarding 
Hillary Clinton was potentially a 
part of the Russian government’s 

effort to get Donald Trump elected 
as president, prior to Donald 
Trump’s son setting up a meeting 
with a Kremlin-associated Russian 
lawyer.

Joseph Fournier, a co-founder 

of MDPAN, felt that those involved 
in the event displayed support 
for a regime that did not support 
many underrepresented groups of 
U.S. citizens.

“It’s just really shocking that 

there 
are 
any 
businesses 
in 

this area in particular that feel 
comfortable endorsing an agenda 
which 
is 
openly 
fascist 
and 

bigoted,” Fournier said. “There 
is a cost if you publicly endorse 
hatred.”

When asked why he felt it 

important to lend a counter-
voice to the Michigan Trump 
Republicans event, Fournier said 
he is gay and the cause is personal 
for him.

“I am a human being,” Fournier 

said. “Can you imagine if a family 
brought their 13-year old gay son 
and he’s not out of the closet, and 
he’s sitting there in a den of people 
that are saying the kind of things 
those people are saying?”

 
 
 COURTESTY OF CHETALI JAIN

Michigan Trump Republicans hosted a meeting at IHop in Novi.


I crossed the ocean twice just to become it. 

Vietnam was supposed to be this surreal, visceral, place of peace. Two months since, my soul is still roaring 

into its body.

I think I like to get as dark as I can so that I can see my mother’s manual labor on my back. Chi tells me that 

Me is out of the hospital and that she is asking about when I am coming back. Christine says I should write for 
pages in Viet. 

I am at dinner with another transracial adoptee. I wonder if she has ever felt the same pain. Waiter refills my 

$6 drink. My mother lives off of $1.50 a day. I choke the guilt down my throat.

I am reading poetry by Ocean Vuong. Maybe this will bring me peace. 

Me, I hope you named me Ocean because you knew I would be restless. My mother tells me I was an absolute 

terror.

Reflections from an Ocean away

By ADAM BRODNAX

Michigan in Color Senior Editor

Reflective fragments, excerpts, bits from my journals, both paper and 

electronic since meeting my birth family.

Waking up in a hostel in Hà Nôi with sweat on your face, or maybe 

it was tears, is never the best way to start the voyage to Ha Long Bay. 
Good thing I’m on the top bunk and no one can see me. I am wilting on 
the inside. 

— the morning after 

Circumstances gave us 20 minutes to fit an entirety of a life. You cried 

for 19 of them. You couldn’t look at me for eight of them. You yelled at 
me for not knowing Viet for three of them. You’re still crying. You turn 
away from me. You tell me you could only care for me for 10 days. I ask 
you about my name. Ocean. You say it was because I was so big. It took 
me 20 years to come back. Security puts his hand on my shoulder. That 
was unfair.

On the way to meet my sister in Long An. She’s a Buddhist nun. She 

comes out from the monastery living quarters to meet me. I see so much 
of myself in her. She puts her hand in mine. Her smile is contagious, 
her laugh is synonymous with joy. She bugs me about not knowing my 
mother’s tongue. She calls me “Em” so I call her “Chi”. She tells me Me 
gave her up when she was seven.1 So I wasn’t the only one. She is grate-
ful that I am not mad at our mother. She assumed I never came back 
because I was mad. 

The language barrier created beauty in smiles, embraces, shared 

stares, synchronized breaths, communal meals. Language isn’t just spo-
ken.

You named me Ocean because I was so big. Who would have fucking 

thought. 

Once someone in Vietnam learned my birth name, they would only 

call me that. Đai Duong.2 It gave me life. 

My sister messages me over Facebook that my oldest brother dreamed 

of finding me one day. He adds me on Facebook. 

In Saigon’s airport — I spent 34 days in the country of my birth. I 
spent 14 hours in the village of my birth. I spent 20 minutes with the 
mother of my birth.

In O’hare’s airport — I schedule a flight to go back to Texas, because I 
 

 miss the mother who raised me. 

At Chipotle, I placed my fork down, full from eating three-quarters of 

a bowl. Naturally got up to throw it away before the weight of knowing 
my Me lives off of a $1.50 a day choked the guilt down my throat. I sat 
back down and finished the rest of the bowl. 

I still feel empty. I thought my harrowed heart would be filled with 

peace after we met. Not sure if consciously choosing to leave the second 
time broke her more. Detachment is a form of trauma.

Vietnam was supposed to be this surreal, visceral, place of peace. 

unfair.

To the mother who birthed me,
I am sorry I am your wound. 
You are the reason I have my almond shaped eyes, 
burning heart, and brave spine
I am the reason you are blistered and broken
For 10 days, you rose with the sun anyway

To the mother who raised me,
I am sorry that I did not come to America a blank canvas
I am sorry you did not get to have the first brush stroke
I am scribbled on, crumpled up and slightly torn
but
you painted around it. You picked up right where Me left off
You became the setting sun

1 “Chi” means “elder sister”, “Em” means “younger sibling”, “Me” means “mother”
2 Translates to Ocean. It is an ancestral way to say Ocean, not used as common as 
the term, “biên” when referring to the ocean.

Thirteen Wolverines 
attend NHL camps

From June 25 to July 12, 13 

members of the Michigan hockey 
team attended 11 different NHL 
Development Camps.

The 
camps 
are 
typically 

week-long 
events 
intended 

to simulate an actual NHL 
training camp for prospects, 
allowing them to gain valuable 
experience 
for 
a 
potential 

professional 
career 
in 
the 

future.

Defenseman 
Luke 

Martin and goaltender Jack 
LaFontaine both participated 
in the Carolina Hurricanes’ 
development 
camp. 
Martin, 

drafted 52nd overall by the 
Hurricanes in this year’s NHL 
Draft, led the Wolverines last 
season with 76 blocked shots 
and 
a 
plus-2 
rating 
while 

appearing in all 35 games as a 
freshman. 

LaFontaine, also a freshman 

last season and drafted by 
the Hurricanes 75th overall 
in 2016, was part of a three-
man rotation at goaltender 
for 
Michigan, 
tallying 
a 

1-7-1 record and a .911 save 
percentage.

The Philadelphia Flyers also 

had two Wolverines at their 
development camp — forwards 
Cooper Marody and Brendan 
Warren. Marody, a sixth-round 
pick of the Flyers in 2015, 
played in just 18 games as a 
sophomore after missing the 
first half of the season with a 
suspension, but still finished 
fifth on the team with 15 
points. 

Warren, whose draft rights 

were traded to Philadelphia 
from 
the 
Arizona 
Coyotes 

during the NHL Draft on June 
24, was one of three players to 
appear in all 35 of Michigan’s 
games in 2017, totalling three 
goals and seven assists.

Sophomore 
forward 
Nick 

Pastujov 
and 
his 
younger 

brother, Michael, were both 
invited 
to 
development 

camps, as well — Nick with 
the New York Islanders and 
Michael with the Detroit Red 
Wings. Michael, a product of 

the 
United 
States 
National 

Development Team Program, 
will suit up for the Wolverines 
as a freshman forward next 
season.

Incoming center Josh Norris, 

a teammate of Pastujov’s on the 
National 
Development 
Team, 

attended camp with the San Jose 
Sharks, who selected him 17th 
overall in the NHL Draft. Norris 
was second on the USNDTP 
in scoring last season with 26 
points in 25 contests.

Forward Will Lockwood, who 

was named Michigan’s Most 
Valuable Player as a freshman 
in 2017, attended the Vancouver 
Canucks’ 
development 
camp 

after a season in which he tallied 
eight goals and 12 assists. The 
Canucks 
selected 
Lockwood 

64th overall in the 2015 NHL 
Draft.

Rising junior Joseph Cecconi 

took part in camp with the Dallas 
Stars. Cecconi, the recipient of 
the Vic Heyliger award as the 
Wolverines’ most outstanding 
defender, scored eight points 
this season on one goal and seven 
assists.

Michigan’s leader in points 

this 
season, 
forward 
Jake 

Slaker, 
attended 
the 
first-

ever 
development 
camp 
of 

the Vegas Golden Knights, an 
expansion team set to begin 
play this season. In his first 
year in Ann Arbor, Slaker 
scored seven points and added 
14 assists.

Goaltender Hayden Lavigne 

competed with fellow freshman 
LaFontaine for playing time 
in the crease this past season, 
going 6-6-1 with an average of 
2.92 goals allowed per game. 
Lavigne attended camp with 
the 
Ottawa 
Senators 
this 

summer.

Defenseman Nicholas Boka 

attended the Minnesota Wild’s 
development camp last week. As 
a sophomore in 2016-2017, Boka 
competed in 34 games, recording 
four points.

The New York Rangers invited 

defenseman 
Griffin 
Luce 
to 

their camp. During his freshman 
season, Luce scored one goal and 
two assists in 27 games for the 
Wolverines.

Pearson welcomes three additions 
to first recruiting class at Michigan

The Michigan hockey team 

has rounded out new head coach 
Mel Pearson’s first incoming 
class with two transfers and 
one additional commitment, the 
program announced Tuesday.

Forwards 
Alex 
Roos 
and 

Luke Morgan will transfer into 
the 
program 
from 
Colorado 

College and Lake Superior State, 
respectively. 
Forward 
Jack 

Becker signed his letter of intent 
after three years with the Sioux 
Falls Stampede of the United 
States Hockey League.

The trio will add attacking 

prowess to a program that 
frequently lacked it in the 
final few seasons under former 
head coach Red Berenson. The 
Wolverines’ Corsi percentage in 
2017 — a metric used to measure 
shot 
attempt 
differential 
at 

even strength — was the third 
worst in college hockey at 42.8 
percent. 
Pearson’s 
Michigan 

Tech team finished fourth, at 
56.5 percent. 

With five incoming forwards 

ready 
to 
replace 
the 
three 

graduating senior forwards — 
including Alex Kile, the team-
leader in shots — Michigan has 
beefed up its depth up front.

Becker has the track record at 

a high level to suggest he may be 
able to help out. The 20-year-old 
notched 28 points — including 16 
goals — last season in 49 games 
in the USHL.

Under 
Pearson, 
Michigan 

Tech showed fervent interest 
in Becker leading up to his 
commitment to the Huskies in 
January. Becker’s father, Russ, 
played for Michigan Tech in 
the 1980s, when Pearson was 
an assistant coach there. With 
Pearson moving to Michigan, 
Becker followed suit, inking his 
letter of intent to Pearson and 
the Wolverines.

Roos played three seasons 

at Colorado College, totaling 
15 goals and 13 assists in 105 
games, though he saw his playing 
time decrease as his career 
progressed. Roos did not play for 
the Tigers last season, instead 

stepping away from the program 
to focus on his economics degree. 
Roos, 22, will have one year of 
eligibility left.

Morgan, 19, helped lead Lake 

Superior State with 22 points 
in his freshman season. He also 
spent a season with the Cedar 
Rapids 
RoughRiders 
of 
the 

USHL, where he notched 25 
points in 60 games. While Roos 
(a graduate transfer) and Becker 
(a commitment) will be eligible 
to play right away, Morgan will 
be forced to sit a year, heeding 
the NCAA’s established transfer 
rules.

While it would be ambitious 

to expect Roos or Becker to 
be slotted into the top six 
forward slots right away — those 
will likely belong to a mix of 
established players such as senior 
Tony 
Calderone, 
sophomore 

Will Lockwood, junior Cooper 
Marody and talented freshmen 
like Josh Norris and Michael 
Pastujov — the newcomers will 
bring valuable attacking depth as 
Pearson attempts to rejuvenate a 
struggling program.

Transfers Roos and Morgan and incoming freshman 
Becker are expected to provide talent, depth on front line

Michigan’s 2018 class taking shape

In February, Jim Harbaugh 

and the Michigan football team 
inked one of the highest-ranked 
recruiting 
classes 
in 
team 

history.

The coaching staff reeled in 

numerous top targets such as 
five-star 
prospects 
Donovan 

Peoples-Jones 
and 
Aubrey 

Solomon down the stretch to 
cement a class that 247Sports 
ranked as No. 5 in the nation.

While 
Harbaugh 
and 

company may not sign a class 
as 
large 
as 
2017’s 
30-man 

group, the Wolverines certainly 
haven’t struggled in recruiting 
this 
year’s 
class, 
which 

currently ranks No. 19 in the 
nation with an average prospect 
rating of 0.9051, according to 
247Sports.

According 
to 
Wolverine 

247 recruiting analyst Steve 
Lorenz, 
Michigan 
hasn’t 

missed often when it comes 
to its top targets in this cycle. 
That has been aided in part by 
geographical location — four-
star 
offensive 
tackles 
Ryan 

Hayes and Jalen Mayfield and 
four-star defensive end Aidan 
Hutchinson are all in-state 
prospects — but the Wolverines 
have had an impressive national 
reach, as well.

Of the 10 prospects who have 

given verbal commitments to 
Michigan thus far, just four 
— four-star offensive guard 
Emil Ekiyor of Indiana and the 
aforementioned trio — are from 
the Midwest. The Wolverines 
have three commitments from 
Georgia, two from Texas and 
one from Florida — three of the 
most talent-rich states in the 
nation.

Meanwhile, 
seven 
of 
the 

ten commitments are ranked 
as 
four-stars, 
according 
to 

247Sports, and all 10, says 
Lorenz, were at or near the top 
of the coaching staff’s board.

“I think the biggest thing 

for me is that they’ve gotten a 
lot of high-ceiling type talent,” 
Lorenz 
said. 
“Obviously 

(Orlando, Fla. quarterback Joe) 

Milton kind of the headliner 
as far as that goes, maybe the 
most high-ceiling player in the 
class. Not a refined product 
yet, has a ways to go, but that’s 
a perfect complement to what 
they’ve done at quarterback, 
and they’ve done that at a few 
different positions.

“With the offensive line, 

(Jalen) Mayfield another guy in 
that vein, a guy whose football 
is definitely ahead of him, and 
then at cornerback as well with 
(Myles) Sims and Gemon Green 
as guys who are just perfect 
fits for the system, but they 
haven’t tapped a lot of their 
potential yet. I think they’ve 
done what they’ve wanted to 
do so far with the depth they 
got in ‘16 and ‘17, I think those 
are the types of guys they want 
in ‘18.”

After 
Harbaugh 
signed 

just 14 recruits in his debut 
recruiting class (one that was 
hurt by Brady Hoke’s firing 
and the relatively prolonged 
hiring process that followed), 
he and his staff signed 56 
players in the following two 
classes combined. Those two 
classes 
have 
replenished 

Michigan’s depth chart while 
also limiting the number of 
available 
scholarships 
for 

2018.

While 
the 
quantity 
of 

recruits that the Wolverines 
can sign this time around may 
be limited, that might still 
yield 
some 
positive 
results 

for Michigan on the trail — 
especially 
considering 
the 

recruiting 
pitch 
that 
the 

coaches have tailored for some 
prospects, such as Cameron 
McGrone, a four-star linebacker 
from Indiana.

“The 
new 
foundation 
is 

in with these new classes, 
so with some of these guys 
it’s, 
‘We’ll 
get 
you 
there 

eventually,’ 
” 
Lorenz 
said. 

“Look at cornerback — those 
guys could compete early, but 
they may have to wait. But 
they’re only taking a few, so 
they can tell them, ‘Hey, you’re 
our guy.’ Or at linebacker, with 
Cameron McGrone, who’s now 

the top target. They can sell 
him like, ‘Hey, you’re our guy 
at linebacker period. We’re 
probably done if we get you.’

“... It is a different approach 

because the last two classes 
have not just been large, but 
they’ve been large and full of 
really talented players, so they 
kinda have to go about it a little 
differently.”

Of course, there are some 

position groups that weren’t as 
well-stocked in previous classes 
that Michigan will have to 
address this time around. After 
failing to sign any tight ends in 
2017, the Wolverines saw Devin 
Asiasi — the team’s highest-
ranked signee at the position 
in 2016 — elect to transfer 
to UCLA. With a relatively 
youthful and unproven group 
after 
Asiasi’s 
transfer 
and 

Jake Butt’s graduation, Lorenz 
thinks Michigan will need to 
sign at least one of their top 
targets at the position in 2018, 
if not multiple.

Jeremy Ruckert, a four-star 

from New York, was one of the 
staff’s top targets but it appears 
that his college decision — 
scheduled for July 17 — will 
be Ohio State. The Wolverines, 
though, 
are 
strongly 
in 

contention for another one of 
their top prospects and may 
have an opportunity to make 
a move with another in the 
coming weeks.

“I 
think 
(Ridge 
Point, 

Texas 
tight 
end) 
Mustapha 

Muhammad remains the best 
bet there,” Lorenz said. “I 
know 
(247Sports 
recruiting 

insider Steve) Wiltfong thinks 
that Michigan will really make 
a move with (Carterville, Ill. 
tight end) Luke Ford next 
weekend, so we’ll have to see 
there.”

Like last year, Michigan may 

have to wait a while before it 
fills its class. The Wolverines 
experienced 
a 
flurry 
of 

commitments last December, 
earning verbal commitments 
from 
Peoples-Jones, 
Cesar 

Ruiz, 
Tarik 
Black, 
Drew 

Singleton, Jordan Anthony and

Flaherty, Thome earn 
invitations to U23 camp

After the Michigan women’s 

basketball 
team 
experienced 

its most successful season in 
program history, two of its 
stalwarts 
earned 
invitations 

to the 2017 USA Basketball 
Women’s U23 National Team 
Training Camp.

Senior 
guard 
Katelynn 

Flaherty and junior center Hallie 
Thome will each compete in the 
camp to be apart of the 12-person 
roster that will ultimately play in 
the first-ever U23 Four Nations 
Tournament in Tokyo, Japan this 
summer. Among the 40 players 
named to the preliminary roster, 
Thome and Flaherty are two 
of four Big Ten players. Kelsey 

Mitchell of Ohio State and 
Teniya Page of Penn State will 
also compete for roster spots.

Flaherty and Thome were 

each vital contributors to the 
Wolverines team that won the 
WNIT Tournament for the first 
time in program history.

Flaherty, invited to a USA 

Basketball trial for the third 
time in her career, led Michigan 
in scoring this past season. In 
the WNIT title game, she made 
multiple career-defining plays, 
nailing two game-tying threes 
in the double-overtime victory, 
and scoring 20 of her 27 points 
after halftime. For the season, 
Flaherty led the team in scoring 
at 20.2 points per game and was a 
unanimous selection by the

Deron Irving-Bey over the 

span of a couple weeks. 

Similarly, most of Michigan’s 

top targets this year appear 
to be waiting to make their 
decisions after taking official 
visits in the fall.

“Once the season hits, guys 

want to take their officials,” 
Lorenz said. “The elite guys, 
everyone 
is 
jockeying 
for 

position with those guys, so 
you’re going to see things kind 
of slow down. Some guys want 
to see how teams perform in 
season.”

There 
are 
a 
couple 

prospects, 
however, 
whose 

timelines may be shorter than 
those of their peers. According 
to Lorenz, McGrone and four-
star 
linebacker/defensive 

back Shayne Simon, of New 
Jersey, may decide before the 
summer ends. Michigan is 
battling Notre Dame for both 

prospects, and in the case 
that either (or both) decide 
to pick the Fighting Irish, the 
Wolverines appear determined 
to continue recruiting until 
the bell.

“I know they’re basically 

biding their time with Notre 
Dame,” Lorenz said. “At least 
from their standpoint, I don’t 
think they expect Notre Dame 
to have a great season. I think 
they may be able to try to pick 
off a couple of (Notre Dame’s) 
guys.”

While 
Michigan’s 
2018 

class 
may 
not 
have 
the 

high-end 
star 
power 
that 

came with previous classes, 
the fact remains that the 
coaching staff has hit on 
most of their top targets thus 
far — even if the recruiting 
rankings may not ref lect that. 
Furthermore, 
they’re 
still 

heavily in the race for many 
of their remaining targets, 
such 
as 
defensive 
tackles 

Tyler Friday, Rick Sandidge 
and Michael Thompson, wide 
receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown, 

Muhammad, McGrone, Simon 
and 
defensive 
back 
Josh 

Jobe, among others. That has 
the 
Wolverines 
potentially 

primed for a big finish this 
winter after getting off to a 
quick start that Lorenz grades 
highly.

“I’d probably say a B+, A- 

type 
grade,” 
Lorenz 
said. 

“I 
know 
(DeSoto, 
Texas 

cornerback) Gemon Green is 
only a three-star, but he was 
literally at or near the very 
top of their cornerback board. 
Might not have the rating 
or ranking, but Michigan’s 
ecstatic about having a guy 
like that on board. Same 
with 
(Georgia 
cornerback) 

Myles Sims, who’s a guy that 
Michigan 
targeted 
early, 

immediately, and got.

“Joe Milton was the first 

quarterback that Pep Hamilton 
offered. … That’s always a huge 
win. Then to get (Ryan) Hayes, 
(Jalen) Mayfield, Emil (Ekiyor), 
all very significant pickups. 
They’ve kind of done what they 
set out to do so far.”

coaches as a first-team all 

Big Ten player. Flaherty, a 
career 38 percent three-point 
shooter, could bring long-range 
shooting and leadership to the 
national roster.

Not to be outdone by her 

counterpart, Thome pitched 
in 25 points in the WNIT final. 
Thome averaged 7.1 rebounds 
per game and shot 61.3 percent 
from the field on the season, 
ranking in the top 10 in Big Ten 
in both categories. Thome was 
a model of consistency in her 
sophomore 
season, 
starting 

all 37 games and scoring in 
double figures in 35 of them. 
She became just the third 
sophomore in school history 
to reach 1,000 points. This 
is her first USA basketball 
invitation.

Thome and Flaherty are both 

coming off seasons in which 
they were named to the first 
team All-Big Ten and the WNIT 
All-Tournament team.

The inaugural tournament 

will 
include 
Australia, 

Canada 
and 
Japan, 
in 

addition 
to 
the 
United 

States. The round-robin style 
tournament will take place 
from August 12-15, and will 
feature exclusively college-
aged athletes.

Both Thome and Flaherty 

figure to be crucial components 
of a team next season hungry to 
avenge what they perceived to 
be an NCAA Tournament snub. 
The appearance would have 
been the first in the program’s 
history.

But under the guidance of 

reigning Big Ten Coach of 
the Year Kim Barnes Arico, 
the program appears to be 
unequivocally 
headed 
in 
a 

positive 
direction. 
Flaherty 

and Thome’s invitations are 
yet another example of the 
talent that is starting to stream 
into and develop inside the 
program.
