ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Reflecting 
on 
wartime 

experiences 
as 
well 
as 

assimilation 
and 
treatment 

after service were six veterans 
who participated in a panel 
on the Vietnam War Tuesday. 
The event was one of many 
offered throughout Veterans 
Week, which the University 
of Michigan’s Veteran and 
Military Services offers this 
Monday through Friday to 
celebrate 
and 
educate 
the 

public about the sacrifices of 
veterans.

The 
six 
men 
served 
in 

various 
positions 
on 
the 

ground and in the Air Force 
during the Vietnam War. One 
panelist, Ted Spenser, said he 
continued his military work in 
a lifelong career.

While each of the veterans’ 

jobs varied greatly, when asked 
by an audience member about 
soldier camaraderie, they were 
all in support of one another.

Panelist Dale Throneberry, 

however, said a distance was 
maintained 
between 
fellow 

servicemen.

In an email obtained by The 

Michigan Daily, University of 
Michigan Regent Ron Weiser 
(R) expressed his desire to 
deny the request of prominent 
white 
supremacist 
Richard 

Spencer to speak on campus.

“Spencer is a disgusting and 

dangerous man. This has been 
expressed by many members 
of the University community,” 
Weiser wrote. “I hope we are 
successful in keeping him off 
Campus.”

Weiser’s statement is, so 

far, the clearest opposition 
to Spencer’s request by any 
member of the University’s 
administration. 
In 
recent 

interview 
with 
The 

DailyUniversity 
President 

Mark 
Schlissel 
said 
the 

only 
thing 
the 
University 

was 
considering 
regarding 

Spencer’s 
request 
was 
the 

University’s ability to ensure 
community safety and a lack of 
disruption.

“What 
the 
University 

will do is it will speak to the

Tuesday’s Ann Arbor City 

Council elections concluded with 
Jane Lumm, Jack Eaton and 
Chip Smith emerging as winners, 
affirming the status quo in the 
legislature. This Tuesday was 
the final odd-year election in Ann 
Arbor, as residents voted in 2016 
to move councilmember term 
length from two to four years.

Ward 2 — WINNER JANE 

LUMM

Incumbent Jane Lumm won 

handily in the Ward 2 elections 
earning 2548 votes, or 64.2 
percent of the 3968 votes cast. 

Her opponent Jared Hoffert 
earned 1420 votes, or 35.8 percent 
of the total votes cast. This will 
be Lumm’s fourth term on City 
Council.

Ward 2 encompasses the east 

and far northeast of Ann Arbor, 
containing large parts of Nichols 
Arb and institutions like the 
Washtenaw Community College.

Lumm could not be reached 

for comment at the time of 
publication.

Hoffert said though he lost, he 

was proud he managed to capture 
more than a third of the vote with a 
quarter of the fundraising Lumm 
had. He also pointed out he won 
in student-heavy Precincts 1 and 
2, even though he was virtually 
unknown prior to running.

“I won Precincts 1 and 2, which 

is very student-based, so I think

Students gather during the CSG meeting on the Diag to promote divestment Tuesday.

Claude 
Steele, 
a 

psychologist known for his 
work on stereotype and social 
identity threat, gave a keynote 
address Tuesday afternoon for 
the Office of Diversity, Equity 
and 
Inclusion’s 
diversity 

summit. 
The 
weeklong 

summit, 
marking 
a 
year 

since the five-year Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion plan was 
launched, first kicked off on 
Monday with a debrief of the 
results of its sample climate 
survey. Steele spoke to over 
100 faculty and staff, though 
not 
many 
students 
were 

present. 

Steele, professor emeritus 

of psychology at Stanford 
University, 
has 
previously 

held 
positions 
at 
the 

University of Michigan and 
University 
of 
California, 

Berkeley. His address focused 
on the topic of how to achieve 
a 
successful 
and 
diverse 

community

Before the event, assistant 

Vice Provost Katrina Wade-
Golden 
told 
The 
Daily 

believed 
Steele’s 
address 

would contribute to the values 
of the summit.

“(His address) points up to 

what our ultimate goal is for 
the summit,” Wade-Golden 
said. “That all can contribute, 
thrive 
and 
grow. 
That’s 

the foundation not only for 
the summit but for the DEI 

initiative as a whole.” 

Robert Sellers, vice provost 

for 
equity 
and 
inclusion 

and chief diversity officer, 
introduced 
Steele 
and 

addressed the importance of 
moving forward in today’s 
society.

“We are no longer standing 

still,” he said. “We are moving 
forward. 
We 
are 
moving 

forward even in the face of 
really really troubling and 
disturbing 
times. 
We 
are 

moving forward in a period of 
time which there is probably 
greater 
divisiveness 
than 

many of us have seen, and this 
divisiveness clearly is much 
broader than our community 
and 
often 
originates 
off 

campus, but like anything, has 

an impact on our campus.”

Steele echoed Sellers on 

the changing sociopolitical 
milieu in America. 

“In a way of background, 

we are in the middle of a 
real demographic shift in 
the population of the United 
States,” Steele said. “And as 
a society it brings challenges,

CSG debates #UMDivest on Diag

Hundreds circle CSG Diag Day meeting
to lobby in favor of and against divestment

Body investigates alleged anti-divestment 
statements by executive CSG member

In support of Palestinians 

and the #UMDivest movement, 
Students Allied for Freedom and 
Equality and more than 250 allies 
formed a human circle around the 
Diag proceeding Central Student 
Government’s first assembly in 
an open space in near-freezing 

weather. The crowd also included 
a large cluster of anti-divestment 
University of Michigan students 
who countered with their own 
lobbying and speeches against 
the resolution. 

SAFE introduced the resolution 

to divest University funds from 
corporations allegedly complicit 
in human rights violations against 
Palestinians. The resolution calls 
upon the University’s Board of 

University 
of 
Michigan’s 

Central Student Government 
voted 
early 
Wednesday 

morning 
to 
convene 
an 

investigative committee — a 
select committee on oversight 
— to review the “improper use 
of CSG materials” by a member 

of the executive team. 

Debate 
extended 
past 

midnight 
on 
two 
separate 

investigations. The final vote 
count stood at 33 for, one 
against and three abstentions. 

According 
to

compiled 
by 
the 
ethics 

committee as stated during 
CSG assembly, a member of the 
executive team allegedly sent

Every Wednesday, The 
Michigan Daily will be asking 
a University affiliate what 
the University’s Bicentennial 
means to them. 

“The Bicentennial is really cool 
because we’re able to not only 
think about our past, but look 
forward to the future. There are 
a lot of initiatives, like Campus 
of the Future and M-BARC, 
which is making a time capsule 
of our entire history essentially, 
so there’s a lot of reflection but 
a lot of planning for the future, 
too, which I think is cool. I think 
reflection is a huge part of — as 
an institution — what we have 
to do in order to learn from our 
past and make a better future 
for our students.”

WOLVE RINE OF THE WE E K

Several members of Central 

Student Government gathered 
in the Chemistry Building 
to spread autism awareness 
Tuesday 
afternoon. 
CSG 

engaged passing students with 
their brightly colored table and 
wheel, which students could 
spin to learn facts about autism 
and engage in conversation.

Public Policy senior Nadine 

Jawad, 
Central 
Student 

Government vice president, 
and 
LSA 
senior 
Shavon 

Edwards, 
senior 
policy 

adviser to Jawad, said they 
have 
dedicated 
themselves 

to promoting neurodiversity 

acceptance 
throughout 
the 

academic 
year, 
putting 
on 

events each month to reach 
out to and educate students 
around campus.

 Few metrics exist around 

austism 
at 
the 
University, 

Jawad 
and 
Edwards 
said, 

because many students are 
either undiagnosed or do not 
disclose to the university. 

Jawad said the issue of 

neurodiversity 
stands 
out 

to her because it touches so 
many students in some way, 
including all members of CSG 
present at Tuesday’s event 
surrounding this issue.

“What’s interesting about 

the 
team 
that’s 
putting 

this together is that we all 
have a different reason and 

experience behind why we 
think that this is important,” 
she said. “From an allyhood 
perspective we need to make 
campus more inclusive and 
accessible to everyone who 
studies here.”

CSG would like to make 

all students at the University 
of 
Michigan 
more 
aware 

of autism in the hopes that 
students will become informed 
enough to become allies to 
autistic peers. LSA freshman 
Usha Yeruva, intern to the 
senior policy adviser, said 
CSG aims to impress upon 
the student body the idea that 
everyone experiences autism 
differently.

“If you’ve met one person 

with autism, you’ve met one 

person 
with 
autism 
and 

that’s something we are 
really 
trying 
to 
push,” 

Yeruva said.

Last 
year’s 
campus 

Diversity, 
Equity 
and 

Inclusion 
climate 
survey 

revealed disabled students 
are 145 percent more likely to 
experience 
discrimination 

than 
students 
without 

disabilities.

Education 
graduate 

student 
Jeff 
Edelstein, 

co-founder of the nonprofit 
College Autism Network, 
was also present at the event. 
Edelstein’s 
organization 

acts as an informational 
hub, connecting students 
with autism to resources 
they need.

“Around 
disability, 

outward or inward, if we 
are trying to create a more 
inclusive campus, students 
with disabilities need to be 
acknowledged to a greater 
degree and there needs to 
be stronger allyhood among 
students,” Edelstein said.

Central Student Government aims 
to spread acceptance for autism

KATE JENKINS

For the Daily


Regents to appoint a committee to 
investigate “the ethical and moral 
implications” of investing in such 
companies. SAFE’s activism on 
divestment — a movement in 
its 13th iteration on campus — 
ramped up in the last month, 
with groups like Latinx umbrella 
organization La Casa supporting 
SAFE in full force last week. The 
resolution failed last year with a 
vote of 34 to 13.

University 
of 
Michigan-

Dearborn’s student government 
passed its version of the resolution 
in March.

CSG convened the assembly 

on the Diag with the intention 
of gathering perspectives and 
spurring 
discussion 
on 
the 

body’s ongoing campus climate 
initiatives. The meeting changed 
course when LSA senior Hafsa 
Tout, CSG representative and 
co-author 
of 
the 
resolution, 

submitted the resolution with 
SAFE this past Sunday. SAFE 
said during the meeting Tuesday 
they were unaware assembly 
would not meet the week of 
Thanksgiving, and had to rush 
the resolution as a result.

Gathering 
on 
the 
Diag 

approximately 30 minutes before 
the meeting, SAFE members and 
allies encircled CSG’s tent on the 
Diag with Palestinian flags and 
signs with messages like, “Divest 
is anti-racist” and “CSG listen to 
marginalized voices.” 

— undisclosed by the CSG 
body — announcing CSG does 
not support the #UMDivest 
movement 
and 
resolution. 

The member allegedly then 
held 
a 
conversation 
with 

another student regarding the 
movement in which he asserted 
CSG’s opposition to divestment.

This email and conversation 

would 
fall 
under 
the 

classification and improper use 
of CSG clerical services and the 
power in the Compiled Code, as 
well as the inappropriate use 
of CSG resources and power, 
as CSG had not voted upon the 
issue of divestment at the time 
of the alleged email statement 
nor conversation. 

The situation is reminiscent 

of a past controversy with 
then-LSA 
sophomore 

Jesse Arm, a former CSG 
representative. 

CSG members could not 

confirm at the time of this 
publication 
whether 
the 

resolution was based off of a 
public Facebook status posted 
by LSA senior Gabe Colman 
that originally claimed LSA 
senior Joe Goldberg — who 
is also on the Hillel board 
and has historically spoken 
against divestment — was 
convincing a representative 
to vote against divestment. 

The post has since been 

edited to remove Goldberg’s 
name, however, Facebook edit 
history and screenshots of the 
original post obtained by The 

Daily show Colman’s original 
text. A CSG member stated 
the identity of the member 
in question is not being 
disclosed “to preserve the 
integrity of the investigation 
and presume innocence of the 
individual(s) in question.” 

CSG Business Rep. Lauren 

Ward, 
a 
Business 
junior, 

commented on the post stating: 
“CSG 
prides 
ourselves 
on 

bringing in the best Michigan 
has to offer. Rest assured, we 
are 
investigating 
into 
this 

situation as this type of rhetoric 
is absolutely deplorable and not 
representative of CSG’s beliefs 
or values.”

The 
Daily 
could 
not 

confirm Ward’s investigation 
is the same as the ethics 
committee’s investigation. 

“These two individuals are 

entitled to their opinions, 
but what is shocking are 
the words he used,” the 
post read. “He said there 
are ‘not enough white men’ 
and ‘Jewish people’ (on the 
assembly), 
which 
alludes 

to the idea that there are 
too many black and brown 
people. 
He 
said 
because 

there are more people of 
color on the assembly, the 
Divestment resolution would 
pass. He then told the woman 
something about checking 
her Facebook friends to make 
sure she was truly on his 
side-- in my opinion, a very 
threatening thing to say.”

who wants to come and 
speak, and try to find a way 
that they can speak in a time 
and a place and a manner 
where we can assure the 
safety of the community. 
And, if we can get to that 

point, then anybody would 
be able to come and speak,” 
Schlissel said. “If we can’t 
get to that point, where 
we can assure the non-
disruptive nature and the 
safety of our community, 
then the person won’t get to 
speak. So that’s the balance. 
And we’re not there yet. We 

don’t know what’s going on 
yet, other than the fact that 
we’re content neutral when 
it comes to speakers.”

Spencer has also spoken 

and requested to speak 
at several other college 
campuses. 
After 
the 

University of Florida was 
threatened with a lawsuit 
after 
initially 
denying 

Spencer’s request following 
the white supremacist rally 
that left one woman dead, 
the 
university 
allowed 

him 
to 
come, 
spending 

$600,000 on security for 
the event. Michigan State 
University, after denying 
a request from Spencer at 
about the same time, was 
hit with a lawsuit from 
Spencer and was recently 
ordered by a judge to enter 
mediation with him.

In the email he sent, 

Weiser wrote, “The courts 
are 
not 
our 
friends,” 

appearing to reference the 
recent court order.

In an email to The Daily, 

Regent 
Andrea 
Fischer 

Newman (R), who is also 
the senior vice president 
for government affairs for 
Delta Air Lines, agreed 
with Weiser, saying she 
“would be happy to defend 
a lawsuit.”

“I hope Richard Spencer 

is not allowed to speak on 
Campus,” she wrote. “I have 
expressed my sentiments 
to the President. I do not 
think it’s a good idea for 
Richard Spencer to speak 
on campus.”

friends, they’d hear the story one 
time and that was it. They didn’t 
want to hear it again.”

Lawrence 
Dolph, 
another 

panelist, said he felt World War 
II veterans bonded through a 
common victory and national 
support, while their service and 
return from Vietnam felt more 
isolating and defeating.

“We never experienced what 

the World War II guys described 
in various terms — I think a term 
they would never use today is 
‘bromance,’ but they seem to be 
very close to one another,” Dolph 
said. “We had to sort of manage 
it just because of the sheer 
carnage.”

The panelists also noted that 

while World War II veterans 
were 
welcomed 
home 
to 

celebrations and praise, Vietnam 
veterans returned to a charged 
political 
environment, 
often 

attracting criticism for events 

outside of their control.

“I think that’s one of the 

things that’s most damaging for 
some of these people’s psyches,” 
Throneberry said. “That you 
did everything you were told 
to do, you did it the best you 
could, saved as many people as 
you could possibly save, and you 
were still just a piece of garbage 
to some people when you got 
home.”

Though receiving backlash 

for their service was upsetting, 
Dolph said many veterans also 
felt conflicted and confused 
regarding the politics of the war.

“Many of us were indifferent 

about the war,” Dolph said. 
“Many of us frankly opposed it.”

Panelist Skip Davis said since 

people were discouraged from 
speaking out about their war 
experiences, 
many 
veterans 

repressed their feelings and 
memories.

“When I got back home, 

I didn’t come home to any 
parades, no pat on the back. … 
Several days later I applied to 
go work for the Detroit Edison, 
and I learned from that day 
to 
compartmentalize,” 
Davis 

said. “I had my work, I had my 
family, I had my working out and 
conditioning, and never once did 
I unlock everything that was in 
my braincase.”

Though most veterans came 

back and were able to start 
new jobs, get married and 
lead relatively normal lives, 

the panelists said they were 
encouraged to repress their 
highly 
impactful 
wartime 

memories from Vietnam.

“The old vets of World War I 

and World War II believed that 
if you didn’t talk about it, you’d 
forget it,” Dolph said. “They’d 
actually tell you that: ‘If you don’t 
talk about it, we’ll forget it.’ Well, 
sometimes you can’t forget it. So, 
I think it’s good to talk about it.”

After 30 years of near silence, 

the panelists said veterans have 
begun to share their stories and 
publicly support each other. 
While limiting conversation of 
Vietnam War experiences may 
have created the illusion that 
most people have forgotten, 
many veterans are now healing 
through more open discourse.

“I still kept everything locked 

down in my head up until a 
few years ago one day when 
everything crept up,” Davis said. 
“It was time for me to go seek 
help. I actually got help at the 
(Veterans Affairs) Hospital, and 
pretty much am aligned with a 
support group of Vietnam vets.”

Throneberry 
said 
modern 

technology 
has 
made 

reconnecting 
with 
fellow 

veterans increasingly possible.

“The 
camaraderie 

part 
actually 
came 
later,” 

Throneberry said. “As much as I 
hate social media, this is where 
it came from, because you were 
finally able to connect with 
these people 40, 50 years later.”

and it raises the question of 
why it’s so important to achieve 
a racially diverse community.”

Steele also noted the issues 

of prejudice and stereotypes 
were not just restricted to race, 
but to gender as well, noting 
the example of Sandra Day 
O’Connor, the first woman on 
the U.S. Supreme Court bench.

Steele 
welcomed 

uncomfortable feelings as signs 
of breaking the boundaries of 
a 
homogeneous 
educational 

community.

“We have to recognize that 

the sense of discomfort isn’t 
something that’s temporary,” 
he said. “It’s a feature of trying 
to bring together a diverse 
community. … When you have 
a very diverse population with 
people coming from a lot of 
different histories, you realize 
that the way we used to educate 
students might not transfer to 
this new population.”

Steele’s most salient piece 

of 
advice 
centered 
around 

building relationships between 
social groups.

“At the heart of it all is trust,” 

he said. “It’s very hard to trust 
across lines. If I’m overstating, I 
might say that I think it’s much 
more important for institutions 
to focus on building that trust 
than to focus entirely on bias. 
There needs to be an ongoing 
effort to build trust within our 
community.”

community

that says something,” Hoffert said. 
“I would love to have the students’ 
voice count.”

Hoffert recalled being humbled 

by running for office and learning 
about the everyday issues that 
affect Ward 2 residents. He said he 
realized that to be able to be a good 
councilmember, he had to be able 
to represent the concerns of every 
resident in the ward.

“For the first time I’ve ever run 

for office, nobody knew who I was; 
I think if you look at it that way it’s 
rather respectable,” Hoffert said. 
“We’ll see what happens in three 
years, if I feel like coming back to 
the table.”

LSA

Jacob 
Caruso 

volunteered 
on 
the 
Hoffert 

campaign, knocking on doors and 
calling voters leading up to election 
night and then running back and 
forth between polling places to 
hear results. He got involved after 
his roommate, who also worked 
on the campaign, persuaded him 
to, but what really drew Caruso to 
the campaign was Hoffert’s desire 
to officially classify Ann Arbor as a 
sanctuary city.

“There’s some ups and downs,” 

Caruso. “It was a good experience 
overall.” 

Ward 4 — WINNER JACK 

EATON

Incumbent Jack Eaton, D-Ward 

4, was victorious in Ward 4 earning 
2371 votes, 70.2 percent of the 3376 
total ballots cast. Independent 
candidate Diane Giannola earned 
26.73 percent of the ward with 873 
votes. This will be Eaton’s third 
consecutive term in City Council.

Eaton told The Daily he is ready 

to get back to the City Council 
chambers. He plans to focus on 
pedestrian 
safety, 
affordability 

and the Gelman plume in the next 
three years, as well as openness and 
transparency initiatives.

While he’s excited at the outcome 

of the election, he isn’t shocked.

“I’m pretty pleased,” Eaton 

said. “I’m not surprised that I won 
because my opponent didn’t run 
a very vigorous campaign but I’m 
pretty pleased with the margin 
of victory. I’m looking forward 
to getting back to work. … It’s a 
privilege to represent the 4th Ward 
and I’m really quite grateful for the 
support they’ve given me.”

Giannola could not be reached 

for comment.

Ward 5 — WINNER CHIP 

SMITH

Incumbent 
Chip 
Smith 

emerged as the winner in Ward 
5’s contentious City Council race, 
defeating Jerusalem Garden owner 
Ali Ramlawi by a small margin. 

Smith won with 3008 votes to 
Ramlawi’s 2826. This will be Smith’s 
second term on City Council. 

When the results were first 

reported, Smith spoke in front of 
a crowd of people at a watch party 
he co-hosted downtown with the 
Hoffert campaign. He thanked his 
family and constituents for their 
support, expressing how proud 
he was of his campaign team. 
In an interview with The Daily 
afterward, he said he was exhausted 
but excited to keep working.

“Nobody’s going to outwork my 

team,” Smith said. “We’ve worked 
really hard right down to the end. … 
We knocked 6,000 doors, we made 
4,000 phone calls, we talked to a 
lot of people and I think that my 
policies reflect that and I’m glad I 
had the confidence of the voters of 
the 5th Ward to keep doing that, but 
that doesn’t mean I’m going to stop 
doing that.”

On the other side of town at his 

own watch party, Ramlawi said he 
was disappointed with the results 
but proud of the close election. He 
was still counting it as a victory and 
said he doesn’t feel ready to give up 
just yet.

“When you get that close it’s 

heartbreaking; you feel like, ‘Wow,’ 
” Ramlawi said. “And then after 
a while, you look at (all these 
people) that voted for me. I’m an 
independent who put a campaign 

together in under three months and 
nearly knocked off an incumbent 
supported by everyone in the 
Democratic party, including the 
mayor knocking on doors for him — 
you’ve got to look at it as a victory. 
You’ve got to keep your head high 
and no regrets. We don’t regret 
a thing; I’m glad we did this. We 
might be back next year.”

Ward 5 contains Ann Arbor’s Old 

West Side, as well as parts of Liberty 
Street. The Gelman dioxane plume 
affects groundwater in the area, but 
development is the biggest issue for 
the residents of the ward.

Smith said he’s going to focus 

on development and affordability 
in the next three years; both issues 
were key parts of his platform. 
When asked about his ideal vision 
for Ann Arbor in the next three 
years, Smith said he hopes the city 
will become a leader in bicycle and 
pedestrian safety, a role-model 
worldwide for what we’re doing 
to curb climate change and a place 
people of all income levels can 
afford to live.

“It’s a lot of work to do. I’m up 

for the work, I’m excited to do the 
work, I’m honored that I’m being 
sent back to do it,” Smith said.

The New Council
Though three incumbents won, 

there will be a new face at the City 
Council meeting this Thursday 
as Anne Banister (D) became the 

new representative of Ward 1 
after defeating incumbent Jason 
Frenzel in the Democratic primary 
in August. Banister is opposed to 
the Library Lot deal and is worried 
about the proposed high-rise.

This means the supermajority 

of eight councilmembers needed 
to pass controversial items like the 
Library Lot deal has disappeared 
from City Council, putting Mayor 
Chris Taylor (D) and his allies in 
a tight spot if they want to push 
through with big plans like the new 
Amtrak station and new housing 
developments.

Taylor said he hopes to work 

effectively with the new council 
to solve pressing issues facing Ann 
Arbor such as affordable housing 
and rising costs for services.

“I think that the issues that 

face us continue to face us,” Taylor 
said. “Those pressures are going to 
continue and so I expect that we’ll 
continue to have a conversation 
about how we make sure that 
Ann Arbor is sustainable and 
affordable.”

Councilmember Julie Grand, 

D-Ward 3, is also excited to 
be working with her familiar 
colleagues again. She worked on 
Smith’s campaign and is especially 
happy he’ll be back on City Council 
with her.

“I’m thrilled about it,” Grand 

said. “I took most of the day off 

today to make phone calls for Chip 
and I hung door hangers in the 
rain on Sunday. It’s really just that 
part of what I love about serving on 
council is that I have these really 
thoughtful, excellent, committed 
colleagues.”

In addition to the three contested 

City Council races, ballots also 
included a millage to increase 
funding for mental health and 
public safety in Washtenaw County. 
The millage passed overwhelmingly, 
much to the surprise of Conan 
Smith, the Washtenaw County 
commissioner for District 9 and a 
lecturer at the Ford School of Public 
Policy.

At Smith and Hoffert’s watch 

party, Smith thanked voters for 
passing this millage, which will 
provide Washtenaw County with 
$15 million to improve public safety 
and mental health. After steady cuts 
from the mental health budget from 
the state of Michigan, Washtenaw 
County wanted to take matters 
into their own hands. According to 
Smith, the majority of the population 
in the Washtenaw County jail face 
mental health challenges and he 
expects this increase in funding 
to greatly improve the services 
available to them.

I 
 

used to have a lot of 
pride for attending the 
University of Michigan, 

a 
university 
I 
considered 

ethical, 
forward-thinking 

and diligent about acting on 
the opinions of its students. 
Lately, however, I have been 
quite 
disappointed 
in 
my 

school. I recently 
learned 

the 
University 
invests 
in 

Roark Capital Group, a large 
private equity firm involved 
in a horrific and widespread 
animal welfare scandal that is 
anything but something to be 
proud of. 

Roark-owned Focus Brands, 

parent 
company 
of 
Moe’s 

Southwest Grill, Schlotzsky’s 
and McAlister’s Deli, recently 
publicly committed to ban 
some of the worst forms 
on animal abuse from its 
supply 
chains. 
But 
Roark 

is also the major investor 
in 
prominent 
restaurant 

companies such as Arby’s, 
Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s, which 
have all failed to address the 
cruelty inflicted on chickens 
slaughtered for meat in their 
supply chains.

Thousands 
of 
people 

nationwide have called upon 
Roark to ensure the rest of the 
chicken-serving 
companies 

it invests in publicly adopt 
similar welfare policies and 
ban 
unthinkable 
cruelties. 

Consumers’ calls, however, 
have been met with complete 
silence. 
If 
Focus 
Brands 

can 
make 
this 
important 

commitment, so can the other 
chicken-serving 
companies 

Roark invests in.

Without 
meaningful 

animal welfare policies, these 
companies 
allow 
suppliers 

to breed chickens to grow so 
quickly that their legs become 
crippled 
under 
their 
own 

bodies. Chickens spend their 
entire lives crammed together 
in dark, crowded sheds, where 
they breathe air filled with 
the stench of ammonia and 
sit in litter soaked with their 
own waste. A lifetime in these 
conditions 
causes 
disease, 

organ 
failure, 
respiratory 

problems and painful sores 
on the chickens’ bodies and 

feet. When it comes time 
for 
slaughter, 
suppliers 

are allowed to shackle live 
animals 
upside 
down, 
slit 

their throats and scald them 
in hot water, often while they 
are still fully conscious.

As a lifelong animal lover and 

advocate, I know no chickens 
should ever be subjected to 
these abuses. I also know 
that chickens are sensitive 
and intelligent animals with 
unique personalities and the 
ability to communicate and 
even 
develop 
friendships 

with each other. Studies have 
shown chickens can complete 
complex mental tasks, learn 
from watching each other and 
pass down information from 
one generation to another. It 

makes me sick to think that 
countless wonderful creatures 
needlessly endure immense 
suffering every day.

Roark has both the power 

and 
ethical 
responsibility 

to encourage the companies 
it invests in to join the likes 
of Burger King, Starbucks, 
Panera Bread, Subway and 
dozens of others by banning 
some of the worst forms of 
animal abuse from their supply 
chains. It’s baffling that Roark 
continues to fail to do what 
is in its power to ensure the 
companies it profits from do 
not take part in heartbreaking 
animal abuse.

I believe the majority of 

University students and alumni 
would not want our institution 
affiliated 
with 
the 
animal 

cruelty that Roark condones. 
I can’t understand why the 
University would support such 
horrors by investing in Roark. 
The University has an ethical 
responsibility to its students 
and to animals to stop profiting 
from animal cruelty.

That’s why I am calling 

upon my fellow students to 
urge the University to take 
a 
stand 
against 
sickening 

animal abuse by divesting 
from Roark. We would never 
idly stand by if our beloved 
pets were facing such terrible 
abuse, so why not take a stand 
for chickens, whose cognitive 
abilities rival those of cats 
and 
dogs? 
Together, 
let’s 

encourage the University to be 
the school we know it can be 
— one we can say we’re proud 
to attend.

T

hroughout 
the 
past 

couple 
weeks, 
all 
I 

have heard about is 

summer internships. Whether 
it’s going to the internship 
fair, applying to internships 
or accepting a position, it’s a 
frequent conversation in my 
circle of friends, housemates 
and classmates.

I 
have 
never 
actually 

applied for a “big time” college 
internship. It’s not that I don’t 
want a cool internship far away 
from home, where I gain job 
experience and connections 
from a fancy company. The 
truth is, whenever I find 
myself on websites to apply for 
positions, I stop myself.

I have begun to recognize 

my inability to apply or start 
an application has become a 
self-fulfilling prophecy. I am 
afraid. I fear if I put myself 
out 
there 
after 
spending 

time and energy with these 
applications, I still won’t get a 
job. So not applying in the first 
place just makes it so much 
easier — I don’t have to deal 
with rejection if I don’t try.

There is great power in fear, 

especially in how it can change 
the way we think. Fear can 
be a driving force that allows 
us to work extremely hard to 
accomplish a difficult task, 
or it can stop us from even 
trying 
because 
they 
think 

they will fail either way. With 
this knowledge, we need to 
consciously work to make our 
inevitable fears a driving force 
in productivity, rather than 
hinder us.

I had never thought about 

this concept until the first 
time I was rejected from the 
University of Michigan. It 
was the summer going into 
my freshman year of college, 
and I had already planned on 
attending my second choice 
school. I was sad but knew I 
could always apply to transfer 
if things didn’t go in my favor.

When 
things 
were 
not 

panning 
out 
at 
my 
first 

university, I applied to transfer. 
I was again sent a rejection 
letter, with the option to be 
considered for the following 
semester. With fear fueling my 
decision, I applied once more 
and tried my best to enjoy 
another semester at my first 
university. On the third try, 
when I was finally accepted, I 
was relieved I had continued 
to persevere because it worked 
out for me in the end.

Now, I see this as an example 

of how the fear of being in a 
situation that was not great 
for me pushed me to work 
harder and persevere through 
rejection. So when I came to 
the University, I was ready to 
apply for a competitive major 
I thought was perfect for my 
goals. I was open to applying 
because I knew I was going to 
continue to work as hard as I 
did before. But when I received 
the news of another rejection, 
I was heartbroken.

When 
applying 
for 

internships, 
schools 
and 

academic programs, the way 
we prepare ourselves for 
acceptance 
and 
rejection 

is 
crucial. 
This 
mental 

preparation or change in 
thought allows us to not be 
fazed because we realize 
rejection is a normal part of 
putting ourselves out there. 

In the case of my major, I 

had not prepared myself for 

the rejection, even though 
I knew the program was 
competitive. 
But 
it 
also 

taught me that if I want 
something or work extremely 
hard, I can still be rejected. 
I am not going to get every 
job I apply for, just like not 
everyone I confess my love 
for is going to love me back.

The way we prepare and 

reflect on these experiences 
helps us grow and build on 
skills for our big goals and 
dreams. They can help us in 
our personal and professional 
life because rejection, fear and 
failure will continue to play a 
role in all areas of our lives. 
The continued experiences we 
have with rejection allow us to 
push forward.

And this means we need to 

do it on our terms and on our 
own time. So this summer, I’m 
not going to have that big-time 
college internship. But when I 
am ready to try again, I know 
I’ll actively work on the way I 
think about my fear of failure. 
I will have to prepare myself 
knowing that it is okay to apply 
to internships and really want 
something because ultimately 
the worst thing they can say 
is no. The truth is most of the 
time, I can always apply next 
year. 

So don’t hold back! Audition 

for the role you always wanted, 
apply 
for 
big-time 
college 

internships and tell the person 
you like that you are interested 
in them. Because you are only 
the one who holds the power 
in the way you think, and you 
can prepare and reflect on 
things to see these experiences 
as steps of growth. As Hilary 
Duff says in my favorite teen 
romantic comedy, A Cinderella 
Story, “Never let the fear of 
striking out keep you from 
playing the game.”

One-click internships

BILLY STAMPFL | COLUMN

T

here’s 
officially 
a 

Common 
App 
for 

internships. Though it 

hasn’t yet gained widespread 
popularity, students across the 
country, tasked until now with 
tediously applying to internships 
one by one, will soon rejoice.

But should they? I’m not so sure.
On 
one 
hand, 
applying 

for 
internships 
is 
time-

consuming 
and 
difficult. 
It 

requires researching different 
internships, writing cover letters 
and refining résumés. A lot of 
companies ask for a statement of 
purpose. Some want a personal 
statement. You need letters of 
recommendation, 
an 
official 

transcript or even proof of 
enrollment at your college. And 
this is once you’ve decided where 
you want to apply — finding out 
what you want to do and where 
you want to work might be the 
toughest and most important 
step of all.

So why not celebrate another 

“There’s an app for that” 
moment that we have grown 
so accustomed to in the digital 
age? Why not take advantage 
of new websites that save time 
and effort?

I was motivated to write this 

column because of a story on 
NPR that details two Georgia 
Tech 
students 
and 
their 

prized innovation, InternBlitz. 
InternBlitz is an online platform 
that allows prospective interns to 
type their standard information 
only 
once, 
then 
apply 
for 

internships. At first only available 
to Georgia Tech students, the 
website is now open to all. The 
site is making it far less tedious to 
apply for internships.

I tried my hand with the 

site and, though its database 
of companies and internships 
is still small, I can see its 
usefulness 
and 
simplicity. 

You simply add a résumé with 
your basic information (name, 
phone number, email, etc.) and 
start picking internships for 
your cart. Once you’re done 
shopping, you review your cart, 
click “Apply” and you’re pretty 
much finished.

Granted, it’s a great idea. 

I’ll never argue that we should 
reject technological innovation 
that 
makes 
things 
simpler 

and probably more efficient. 
But I wonder if a website like 
InternBlitz will be costly in the 
long run.

To prove my point, it might be 

useful to compare InternBlitz to 
Amazon. On Amazon, you shop 
for clothes, books and accessories. 
For the most part, the things 
people buy on Amazon are not 
essential (though this is probably 
going to change).

On 
InternBlitz, 
you 
shop 

for internships. It’s safe to 
assume that, in a perfect world, 
consumers (or applicants) should 
spend more time picking the 
perfect internship than they 
do choosing the perfect adult 
party game. (The “What Do 
You Meme” adult party game 
was listed as the No. 1 bestseller 
in Amazon’s Toys and Games 
category for November.)

I support Amazon and the 

ways in which it has made 
consumerism more efficient. But 
sometimes time and effort are 
indispensable. They’re necessary. 
Yet we have started dedicating 
all of our energy to minimizing 
the amount of time and effort 
required to do things that have 
always taken time and effort.

There should not be a Common 

App for internships because 
students need to go through the 
painstaking task of applying. It’s 
a process that allows students to 
explore different career paths and 
make connections with people in 
different fields. It’s beneficial for 
companies to know who is willing 
to work hard writing cover 
letters and personal statements 
— students who really want the 
job do these things, while those 
who aren’t as passionate choose 
not to go through the hassle. 
All the extra effort that comes 
with applying to internships is 
a powerful signal to employers 
that the applicant is dedicated to 
getting an opportunity.

I’m currently applying for 

internships in Washington, D.C., 
for next semester. I want to work 
and do research at a think tank, 
where there are always far more 
applicants than open positions. 
Most of the think tanks also 
require bundles of materials, and 
it takes a lot of time to find the 
right organizations and sort out 
cover letters and résumés.

But there are two benefits to 

this struggle. For one, I’ve learned 
a lot about the different think 
tanks in Washington and what 
each of them does. This will make 
my final decision more informed 
and more likely to benefit me in 
the long term.

Second, I like to think that 

not everyone is willing to go 
through the struggle. I would like 
to imagine some of my potential 
competitors are not willing to put 
in the time that applying requires. 
But if a platform like InternBlitz 
is available to everyone, that 
assurance disappears, and it 
doesn’t matter if a student has 
the work ethic needed to write 
countless 
cover 
letters 
and 

personal statements.

For these reasons, I don’t 

support InternBlitz. Researching 
and applying to internships is 
meant to be time-consuming. The 
process weeds out the weak and 
distinguishes those who truly 
want to take advantage of an 
internship experience.

Again, I’m not advocating 

neo-Luddism. I like technology, 
and though I think we could 
use it more effectively, digital 
innovation is undoubtedly aiding 
economic growth and making 
hard tasks easier. But why can’t 
some hard things just remain 
hard? When conceiving new 
websites and startups, we need to 
consider the costs of the ease for 
which we’re striving.

InternBlitz and other websites 

are already in use and will most 
likely become more and more 
popular. Students will be happy 
to avoid the painstaking process 
of applying for internships. But 
we should consider what we’re 
losing in the long run. Time 
spent 
researching 
internships 

and writing cover letters is well 
spent. It would be a shame if 
thousands of students chose the 
wrong internship because they 
didn’t have to really look into any, 
or if students who were willing to 
do the work didn’t get at least a 
little recognition from employers. 
In 
this 
case, 
technological 

innovation doesn’t seem to be 
helping us.

DISCOVERY

Pablo Escobar stars
‘Escobar’ is a break from 
Discovery’s typical drivel

Discovery adds to the multitude of drug lord-related series

Over the last few years, there 

has been a strange phenomenon 
brewing among the world’s TV 
viewers: An obsession with 
the infamous Colombian drug 
lord Pablo Escobar, a man who 
was simultaneously a brutal 
killer and one of the most 
wanted men in the world, but 
also one who was beloved by 
many. Series such as Netflix’s 
hit “Narcos” have been the 
main sources of this new rise 
in 
interest, 
and 
Discovery 

Channel continues the trend 
with the documentary series 
“Finding Escobar’s Millions.”

The show centers around 

two ex-CIA agents: Doug Laux 
and Ben Smith, the former 
having 
previously 
gained 

recognition after writing a 
memoir about his time in, and 
the discomfort he experienced 
while in the agency. Right 
off the bat, it is apparent that 
these two are legitimate and 
qualified selections, and the 
show will not be too similar 
to some of the drivel that 
channels such as Discovery 
and The History Channel have 
recently produced. The pair are 
investigating the existence/
location of millions of dollars 
in cash hidden by Escobar 
throughout his lifetime spread 
all around Colombia. They 
enlist the aide of figures who 
were in Escobar’s inner circle, 
scientists who provide high-
tech equipment and journalists 
from Colombia’s most prolific 
newspapers.

As one could expect, such an 

investigation requires the two 
leads forced to interact with 
some unsavory and dangerous 
figures in some of the poorest 
neighborhoods of cities such 

as Bogotá and Medellín. The 
show does address this and 
lets the viewer understand 
the stakes at each stage of 
the mission. Unlike in many 
“reality 
shows” 
produced 

by Discovery, the dangers in 
this series are real and not 
exaggerated 
for 
dramatic 

effect. Ironically, despite this, 
the show doesn’t do a great 
job transmitting that fear into 
the audience. While a Sicario-
esque atmosphere would have 
felt out-of-place, the cheesy 
and generic music and sound 
effects used during some of 
the 
most 
tense 
sequences 

simply 
felt 
cheapening. 
In 

general, many of the shots 
feel extremely repetitive and 
similar to shots viewers would 
have seen a hundred times.

The show does however 

provide suitable context and 
background 
information 

regarding Escobar and his life, 
and goes into further detail, 
especially in certain sequences 
in 
important 
Colombian 

newspapers. It does feel that 
the leads are doing a legitimate 
investigation. Another benefit 
of having such qualified leads 
is that they provide valuable 
insight into their thinking 
during 
certain 
situations. 

Some of the best parts of the 
show are when one of the two 
provides a brief, but realistic, 
assessment of the situation he 
is in, taking into account the 

body language of the person he 
is speaking to, the movement of 
the people and things around 
him and how the environment 
and mood changes around 
him, 
highlighting 
the 

perceptiveness and training 
the individuals draw upon 
constantly 
during 
such 
a 

mission. For example, during a 
conversation with an Escobar 
associate 
in 
a 
precarious 

neighborhood, Laux walks the 
viewer through how he was 
gauging the mood and tone 
of the associate, and how he 
applied certain techniques to 
extract as much information as 
possible, while trying to endear 
himself to an influential, yet 
dangerous, man.

What 
remains 
relatively 

unexplained, 
however, 
is 

the 
pair’s 
motivation 
for 

undertaking such a mission 
in the first place. It is briefly 
touched upon, but all we learn 
is that money is not their 
motive, since they have to give 
away 95 percent of any money 
they find to the Colombian 
government anyway. It would 
be nice to know why two 
former CIA agents have such 
a desire to go on a dangerous 
mission, and why they care in 
the first place? Perhaps their 
motive is simply the thrill of 
the mission.

“Finding Escobar’s Millions” 

is a gripping account of a very 
real story about a man that has 
captured the imagination of 
TV viewers around the world. 
Unfortunately, the production 
and cinematography of the 
show detract from, rather than 
enhance, the engaging topic 
and 
storyline. 
Nonetheless, 

it is a series that should keep 
viewers 
coming 
back 
for 

more to explore how Laux 
and 
Smith’s 
investigation 

continues and concludes.

Jewish identity is explored 
in Basement’s ‘Bad Jews’

Stereotypes and more are placed in conversation in Harmon’s play

Three cousins sit in a small 

studio apartment on Riverside 
and 84th street in New York 
City. They are arguing about 
a necklace — which holds far 
more value than what appears 
on its surface.

This week, Basement Arts 

presents “Bad Jews,” a play 
written by Joshua Harmon. 
It is a story that projects the 
significance of familial ties, 
tradition and how a family’s 
history influences the present.

“It is the night of the cousins’ 

grandfather’s funeral, who was 
the patriarch of the family 
and a Holocaust survivor,” 
said School of Music, Theatre 
& Dance Senior and director 
Noa Gelb. “They are currently 
discussing who gets the relic of 
the family, which is this Haim 
necklace, the Jewish word for 
‘life.’”

The play revolves around four 

characters who each provide 
different perspectives on topics 
of identity and understanding 
the impact of their Jewish 
roots. Daphna, played by LSA 
sophomore Sydney Prince — 
from her thick, curly hair, to 
her headstrong and assertive 
demeanor 
— 
embodies 
the 

stereotypical Jewish woman. 
Daphna’s cousins, Liam, played 
by 
SMTD 
junior 
Matthew 

Kemp, 
and 
Jonah, 
played 

by 
LSA 
sophomore 
Devin 

Raymond, are very different in 
personality. Those differences 
bring about their own series of 
problems within the ongoing 
debate.

“Liam 
and 
Daphna 
are 

very similar, but on opposite 
sides,” Gelb said. “They have 
a lot of conflict, but they are 
essentially the same person, 
just with opposite opinions.”

The 
playwright, 
Joshua 

Harmon, 
illuminated 
these 

similar-but-opposite dynamics 
in his script.

“Harmon does this great 

thing — every time they speak 
without the other in the room, 
they have all these repeated 
lines that they don’t even know 
the other person is saying,” 
Gelb said.

Melody, played by Nursing 

freshman Ashley Musleh, is 
immensely different than the 
other three characters. She is 

the “non-Jew,” who acts as the 
well-behaved juxtaposition to 
the rest. She is Liam’s girlfriend 
and finds that she clearly does 
not fit in with the company 
surrounding her.

“She 
[Melody] 
is 
thrust 

into this situation of this 
very 
strong, 
independent, 

opinionated Jewish girl, her 
also strong, opinionated cousin 
and their youngest cousin, who 
is trying to mediate between 
them without causing conflict,” 
Gelb said. “It’s a great show 
about relationships, family and 
outsiders.”

As the play moves through 

the incessant debate of who 
will receive the relic of the 
family, there is an added twist.

“This 
necklace 
was 

used as a ring, almost as a 
proposal mechanism for the 
grandmother for the “next” 
person, and the next spouse. 
Now Liam wants to propose 
to his girlfriend, using this 
necklace, thereby taking it 
out of the faith and out of the 
family,” Gelb said.

The initial conflict becomes 

far more complex as new 
problems arise in considering 
how a symbol of the Jewish 
family 
can 
be 
transferred 

outside of its traditional realm. 
Gelb described how unique 
the Jewish faith is in that it 
represents a set of religious 
practices as well as a cultural 
community.

“They all have very different 

views of what being Jewish 
means,” Gelb said. “What does 
it mean to be Jewish and not 
want to carry on the faith in 
the way that your community 
expects you to? What does 
it mean when your faith is 
your community and when 

your community betrays your 
faith?”

In 
considering 
more 

questions that the play grapples 
with, Gelb discussed recent 
discoveries while studying the 
script with the cast.

“One thing that the show 

has created controversy for is 
the stereotypical nature of the 
characters,” Gelb said. “The 
very pure Gentile, very strong, 
opinionated woman and this 
fragile masculinity — they are 
all very heightened. One thing 
that we have explored is how 
we can take these stereotypes 
and add a little sympathy to 
them.”

To combat the limitations 

posed 
by 
stereotypical 

depictions, the cast aimed to 
find depth in each character 
and 
challenged 
existing 

standards. Among the many 
topics 
this 
play 
explores, 

Gelb 
defined 
the 
specific 

stereotypes 
that 
surround 

the Jewish people: the idea 
of being “chosen people,” the 
Holocaust as an incredibly 
formative event of the past 
and the extreme importance of 
maintaining Jewish identity in 
our modern world.

“It so important that people 

identify as Jewish,” Gelb said. 
“Not only did they come from 
a Jewish background, but that 
they are Jewish.”

When 
asked 
about 
a 

rewarding part of the project 
as the director of the show, 
Gelb recalled a certain moment 
when she watched everything 
begin to piece together.

“Normally I shout out things 

they need to fix, as I direct 
the scene. There was one 
point when we were doing it 
yesterday and we were sort of 
drilling it over and over until 
we got what we wanted,” Gelb 
said. “I forgot to stop them 
because I was so immersed in 
watching it. We had reached 
the end of the show and they 
were sitting there for like 
three minutes because I had 
forgotten to call blackout.”

Gelb’s explained that when 

she first saw “Bad Jews” in 
D.C. she thought the show was 
funny and informative: “It was 
true to my identity as a Jew. 
It was a beautiful, theatrical, 
educational experience.” She 
hopes to provide a similar 
experience for audiences this 
weekend.

MATADOR

Look at those two
Vile and Barnett are the 
perfect pair at Royal Oak

The duo performed in Michigan right on the heels of their release

Just 
four 
days 
before 

her 
birthday, 
Australian 

Scorpio and, perhaps more 
importantly, 
musician 

Courtney Barnett made a stop 
in Royal Oak for a show with 

American rock’n’roller Kurt 
Vile, on tour in support of their 
collaborative album, Lotta Sea 
Lice. Released in early October, 
the album came as a relative 
surprise, an eventual product 

of Barnett and Vile’s recent 
friendship which bloomed after 
they met on the festival circuit 
last 
summer. 
Consisting 
of 

almost the entirety of Lotta Sea 
Lice, as well as hits from each 
of the duo’s solo discography, 
their 
performance 
on 
Oct. 

30 
was 
conversational 
and 

relaxed, much like the album 
itself. As the two wound the 
audience through their folk-
rock 
musings, 
it 
became 

evident that the collaboration 
between them was just as much 
authentic friendship as it was 
an exercise in musicianship.

Barnett and Vile, supported 

by the Sea Lice — Janet Weiss, 
Stella Mozgawa, Rob Laakso 
and Katie Harkin — opened 
with the first several songs 
off the album, in order. The 
two 
are 
charismatic 
but 

unassuming, both with their 
unkempt 
brown 
hair 
and 

quiet 
manner. 
Few 
words 

were spoken between songs, 
but watching the two interact 
onstage spoke volumes. When 
they played their fifth song, 
leading 
single 
“Continental 

Breakfast,” Barnett and Vile 
shared a not-so-furtive smile 
as they harmonized on its final 

lyric, as if perhaps they had 
stumbled over the moment 
numerous times in rehearsing 
it. There was a spontaneity to 
the act, and the sense that it 
was involuntary for each of 

them evidenced joy at its most 
carefree and honest.

Similar 
moments 

characterized 
the 
rest 
of 

the show, as the audience 

was treated to more than a 
performance, but a window 
into the friendship between 
two of the greatest lyricists 
of the day. “This song is about 
wakin’ up, and smelling your 
bandmate in the bunk next to 
you,” Vile playfully jabbed at 
Barnett before one song. Later, 
he thanked her for “taking 
him on tour,” an act of subtle 
deference that hinted at the 
deep sense of mutual respect 
between the two.

Aside 
from 
their 
banter, 

Barnett and Vile’s interactions 
within the music itself was 
fascinating. Vile on lead guitar 
for Barnett’s “Depreston” and 
“Avant 
Gardener” 
gave 
the 

songs a new, more spacious 
dimension 
while 
Barnett’s 

support on Vile’s “Life Like 
This” and “Pretty Pimpin’” 
contributed 
a 
subtle 
edge. 

The synergy between the two 
performers — as well as the 
Sea Lice — ultimately made for 
an engrossing, and thoroughly 
wholesome, evening of music. 
It’s unclear whether this is a 
one-off collaboration or just the 
first installment. Regardless, 
this is one intercontinental 
friendship you shouldn’t miss.

‘U.N.C.L.E.’ is stylish fun

‘The Man from U.N.C.L.E.’ an imperfect, but unappreciated thriller

In 2015, director Guy Ritchie 

(“King Arthur: Legend of the 
Sword”) released “The Man From 
U.N.C.L.E.,” a Cold War spy caper 
featuring Henry Cavill (“Batman 
vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice”), 
Alicia Vikander (“Submergence”) 
and Armie Hammer (“Call Me 
By Your Name”) as a motley crew 
of international spies hunting 
for a missing warhead. The film 
seemed to be one nobody had 
asked for, adapted from a low-
brow 1964 television series of 
the same name. What’s more, 
it opened just weeks after spy-
movie 
blockbuster 
“Mission 

Impossible: Rogue Nation.” As a 
result, ticket sales were less than 
spectacular. With tepid critical 
reviews, the film came and went 
as little more than a blip on the 
2015 summer movie radar. Today 
the film remains one of the most 
underrated spy films to come 
out of the last decade, featuring 
dazzling stylization, irresistible 
cast chemistry and an electrifying 
soundtrack.

The spy flick was once a pillar 

of popular cinema: Filled with 
suave machismo, high fashion and 
exorbitant amounts of innuendo, 
the style of the classic spy movie 
is a cultural icon. Today, they 
don’t make spy movies like they 
used to; box offices are dominated 
by dark, gritty films like “The 
Bourne” series, and even the 

once-campy “James Bond” films 
now boast sleek, blue-tinted color 
palettes.

“The Man From U.N.C.L.E.” 

is an homage to a bygone era of 
film. It doesn’t concern itself with 
deep, troubled backstories or a 
dark, moody aesthetic. The film 
meticulously recreates the style of 
the classic spy film, from its split-
screen action sequences to its 
dramatic camera zooms. The film 
revels in this campy, carefree style 
with just enough modern flair 
to not feel dated. Critics panned 
the film for prioritizing style over 
substance, which it did. However, 
positing that criticism of this 
kind of film is like comparing 
Dr. Pepper to fine wine. The film 
wasn’t made to be deep — it was 
made to be stylish and fun, a goal 
it achieves in spades.

The 
cast’s 
chemistry, 
too, 

stands out as a highlight of the 
film that was largely overlooked 
by critics. Each of the main 
characters is likeable on their 
own, from Cavill’s suave Napoleon 
Solo to Hammer’s stalwart Illya 
Kuryakin to Vikander’s charming 
Gaby. Together, however, these 
three feed off of one another 
and create a cast dynamic that’s 
downright 
irresistible. 
The 

characters all serve as excellent 
foils for one another, such as in 
a scene where Illya sits in a hotel 
room and quietly plays chess with 
himself, trying (and failing) to 
ignore Gaby drunkenly dancing to 
Solomon Burke’s “Cry to Me.” The 
interactions between the film’s 
main characters are repeatedly 

grin-inducing, and they’re part of 
what makes the film as much fun 
as it is.

Speaking of “Cry to Me,” did I 

mention that this soundtrack is 
incredible? Because it is. Not only 
does the film sample numerous 
’60s Italian pop classics (including 
one particularly memorable scene 
featuring 
Peppino 
Gagliardi’s 

“Che 
Vuole 
Questa 
Musica 

Stasera”), but it also contains 
numerous 
standout 
original 

compositions. A large virtue of 
these original compositions — 
composed by Daniel Pemberton 
— is how well they fit the action 
taking place on the screen. For 
example, during a car chase the 
engines may rev in unison with 
ripping electric guitar riffs, or 
the cars may bounce along a dirt 
trail to the beat of the soundtrack 
piece. This synchronization is 
subtle, but it lends the film a 
unique cadence that’s all its own.

It may not be a dramatic 

masterwork, but from my first 
viewing of “The Man From 
U.N.C.L.E.” back in 2015, I 
knew the film was significant 
as a tribute to the golden age of 
on-screen espionage, and all the 
bravado, style and campiness 
that came with it. It’s absolutely 
an imperfect film, and not one I’d 
ever try to pretend is flawless, but 
those flaws rarely seem to impact 
the 
experience 
of 
watching 

the film. Instead, “The Man 
From U.N.C.L.E.” is the type of 
cinematic experience that thrills 
and entertains for every second of 
its 116 minutes.

CBS

“Life in Pieces” airs Thursdays on CBS
‘Life in Pieces’ is busy but 
bland as it enters season 3

CBS’s attempt to compete with ‘Modern Family’ falls flat

My face blank and my spirit 

blasé, I sat in front of the screen 
on a gloomy Thursday night in 
hopes of laughing at the outlandish 
endeavors of the Short family. And 
yet, there was nothing — nothing 
in the entirety of that half-hour 
episode that evoked a genuine 
laugh or even the slightest chuckle.

While 
the 
season 
three 

premiere of CBS’s “Life in Pieces” 
wasn’t particularly awful, it felt 
generically stale in plot and tired 
in attempting (for a third year) to 
level with its prime-time sitcom 
“competition,” 
ABC’s 
“Modern 

Family.” It’s disheartening that a 
series with an innovative, vignette-
style structure and proficient 
cast appears to be traveling on 
a downwards slope, but after 
two seasons of the same old, 
scheduled humor, it’s clear why. 
A show highlighting four distinct, 
rarely 
interlinking 
plotlines 

simply translates to a whole lot of 
confusion, not the intended, nicely-
segmented chronicles of a chaotic 
family. Even more perplexing, 
sometimes there’s a tying-together 
point, and sometimes there’s just 
not.

To start off season three, 

we pick up with newlyweds 
Matt 
(Thomas 
Sadoski, 
“The 

Newsroom”) 
and 
Colleen 

(Angelique 
Cabral, 
“Enlisted”), 

whose nightmarish honeymoon is 
looking materialistically brighter 
after Colleen is granted two million 
dollars in settlement for her fall off 
of their motel balcony. But after the 

couple receives the bad news that 
the motel has filed for bankruptcy 
and the settlement is off, they are 
forced to abruptly end the whole 
family’s 
Vegas 
getaway. 
This 

short story features the all-too-
predictable arc of the newly rich 
losing all of their money, and while 
it was admittedly entertaining to 
watch the misfit family pop bottles 
on a party bus, it felt like this story 
ends before it gains any ground.

The second vignette focuses 

on Greg (Colin Hanks, “Dexter”) 
and 
Jen’s 
(Zoe 
Lister-Jones, 

“Whitney”) feeble and ineffective 
attempt to crack their daughter’s 
pacifier addiction. Again, while 
this short story brought up some 
very contemporary and amusing 
issues, such as Jen’s request that the 
fictional “pacifier fairy” be a man 
who battles against sexism, all-in-
all, it left me feeling disinterested 
and 
unaffected. 
Even 
with 

Hanks and Lister-Jones’s natural 
chemistry and quarreling, their 
comedic timing and brilliant facial 
dialogue are frequently underused 
in a mediocre plot.

Then there’s the two final 

stories (which blended together 
into one in my mind), in which 
the young and emotionally lost 
Sophia (Giselle Einsenberg) runs 
away to visit the rubble of the 
family’s 
recently 
burnt-down 

house, while elsewhere, Tyler 
(Niall Cunningham) announces 
that he and Clementine (Hunter 
King, “Hollywood Heights”) are 
“romantically unsyncing” (AKA 
divorcing). Both of these vignettes 
open up scenarios for heartfelt 
child and parent conversation, but 
these moments come off as forced 
and easily-fixable. In a sitcom with 
the premise of illustrating tried 
and true familial adversity, would 
it really be that hard to showcase 
some authenticity?

The only real redeeming quality 

to “Life in Pieces” is its star-
studded roster of talent, which 
shows up to play no matter what 
uninspiring tropes and worn-out 
plot lines they are constrained to. 
The cast carries the series on its 
shoulders; it’s just regrettable that 
we only see so little of them in such 
fast-paced episodes. If you blink, 
you might miss Hanks masterfully 
throw some side-eye after a 
witty remark or James Brolin 
(“Westworld”), as family patriarch 
John, curmudgeonly react to his 
family’s bizarre antics. And if you 
miss that, you’ve essentially missed 
all the entertainment.

After enduring two seasons of 

similar dissatisfaction and yearning 
for originality, I unfortunately 
came to expect this lackluster of 
a “Life in Pieces” premiere. After 
all, the title slide reads: “One big 
family. Four short stories. Every 
week.” And if that doesn’t sound 
like the basis of every sitcom ever, 
then you’re likely still stuck on 
creator Justin Adler’s bandwagon 
— believing in the unforeseen 
potential of this imitated, insipid 
comedy.

UMS brings Chanticleer 

This 
Friday, 
the 
Grammy 

award-winning group Chanticleer 
will perform “Heart of a Soldier” 
at Hill Auditorium. Chanticleer 
blends 12 male voices to create an 
“orchestra of voices.” The group 
performs interpretations of vocal 
literature 
and 
contemporary 

compositions.

The show tells stories about 

soldiering by traveling through 
history through music, looking at 
music by William Byrd about the 
Babylonian Captivity and the fall 
of Jerusalem, and by Janequin 
about the Battle of Marignano. It 
also looks at popular pieces from 
the world wars and ending with 
a reminder of peace with music 
composed by artists such as John 
Musto.

“This 
concert 
is 
slightly 

different from what might be 
called 
a 
‘typical 
Chanticleer 

show,’” 
wrote 
Chanticleer 

Music Director, William Scott, 
in an interview with The Daily. 
“Those shows started with very 
early music, perhaps Gregorian 
chant, and ended with some 
combination of Gershwin and 
African-American spirituals. This 
program, on the other hand, ends 
with a message about peace that 
is not only timely but, we hope 
elegant and moving.”

Chanticleer does not stop at 

just the music. Instead, the group 
also displays the emotional and 
theatrical realms of soldiering. 
From loss to betrayal to rage to 
hope, there is an intense range for 
the soldiers they portray.

“It is a program of lights and 

shadows, happiness as well as 
sadness, fast music and slow, in a 
variety of languages and styles, 
with giddy sound effects alongside 
poignant reminders of how much 
better peace is, after all,” Scott 

wrote.

In 
doing 
so, 
Chanticleer 

encompasses 
the 
entire 

experience of being a soldier 
with grace, touching its audience 
members in the process. They are 
coming to the University as a part 
of Veterans Week.

“We have had many veterans 

come up to us with tears in their 
eyes, thanking us for the way 
the program seems to point out 
the ennobling contribution of 
soldiers to our country’s (and any 

country’s) past,” Scott wrote.

Scott noted how gratifying it 

is to have touched people in such 
a way. He also wrote that many 
people especially enjoy singing 
along in pleasure to the pop songs 
“My Buddy,” “Boogie-Woogie-
Bugle-Boy” and “Where Have All 
the Flowers Gone.”

“As always, music touches 

people in a visceral and sometimes 
vulnerable spot,” Scott wrote. 
“I hope we sing the program 
convincingly, in tune, with good 
diction and style and that the 
audience will feel that they have 
enjoyed going on this musical 
journey with us.”

The U-M Glee Club will also 

make a cameo appearance in the 
performance. Scott noted that 
one of his favorite moments will 
definitely be when the Glee Club’s 
singers join in singing Jennifer 
Higdon’s touching “Our Beautiful 
Country.”

Chanticleer began discussing 

the concept because the duality 
between history and emotions 
seemed 
interesting. 
They 

received exciting responses from 
composers 
Mason 
Bates 
and 

Musto and moved on to create the 
compelling program that is now 
“Heart of a Soldier.”

“What we hadn’t known at 

the time we started planning this 
program was the incredible need 
to remind ourselves of the siren 
call of peace that so needs to be 
heard right now.”

Bracket breakdown: Analyzing potential NCAA Tournament opponents

Ranked 
No. 
11 
at 
the 

beginning of the season, the 
Michigan field hockey team has 
proven that ranking was far too 
low. The Wolverines rattled off 
16 wins in a row with 13 shutouts 
to finish off their season. Then, 
Michigan 
dispatched 
Ohio 

State, No. 9 Northwestern and 
No. 5 Penn State to win the 
Big Ten Tournament, securing 
an automatic bid to the NCAA 
Tournament. 

There is no longer any dispute 

about Michigan’s status as a top 
team. The Wolverines earned 
the third overall seed and will 
host Syracuse on Saturday. The 
Daily broke down Michigan’s 
side of the bracket.

No. 3 Michigan
Michigan finished its season 

with an undefeated 8-0 record 
in conference play and swept 
the Big Ten regular season 
and 
tournament 
titles. 
The 

Wolverines have a good balance 
of 
offensive 
and 
defensive 

standouts who work together 
cohesively. They rank second 
in the nation in goals-against 
average, eighth in goals per 
game 
and 
fifth 
in 
scoring 

margin.

Senior 
goalkeeper 
Sam 

Swenson was named the Big Ten 
Defensive Player of the Year, and 
senior forward Katie Trombetta 
the Big Ten Player of the Year. 
Both were unanimous All-Big 
Ten 
First 
Team 
selections. 

Sophomore 
forward 
Meg 

Dowthwaite, who ranks 15th in 
the nation in goals scored, was 
also named to the first team. 
Fifth-year 
senior 
midfielder 

Esther de Leijer, who scored 
the winning goal in the Big 
Ten Tournament championship 
game despite a broken hand, 
made the second team.

Though the Big Ten is not as 

strong as the ACC, Michigan has 
proved it is up to the challenge. 
The Wolverines’ offense has 

been inconsistent at times — 
they were outshot by Penn State 
in the Big Ten Tournament 
final and didn’t score the game-
winning goal until the final 
minutes — which could cause 
them trouble against a top-
ranked defense like Syracuse. 
But if Michigan finds its groove, 
it will be a hard team to beat.

No. 11 Syracuse
Syracuse didn’t make it out 

of the quarterfinals of the 
ACC Tournament, losing 3-2 to 
Louisville. However, the Orange 
managed an at-large bid due to 
the strength of their conference. 
Despite finishing 2-4 in ACC 
play, they were 12-6 overall, 
including seven victories over 
ranked teams.

Syracuse has one of the 

stingiest defenses in the nation, 
ranking third in shutouts per 
game and goals-against average. 
It’ll be a battle of strengths as 
it faces a Michigan team that 
ranks first and second in those 
categories, respectively.

Still, the Orange allowed 

fewer 
shots 
on 
goal 
than 

any team in the tournament 
besides Connecticut, which is 
no small feat considering their 
powerhouse conference. Two 
defenders made the All-ACC 
teams: senior Lies Lagerweij 
was named to the first team, 
and junior Roos Weers made the 
second team.

Offensively, senior midfielder 

and forward Laura Hurff, an 
All-ACC Second Team selection, 
is a standout, but the team ranks 
only 15th out of 18 teams in the 
tournament in goals scored per 
game.

Facing 
one 
of 
the 
only 

other teams that can match 
its defensive prowess will be a 
challenge for Syracuse, and that 
should give the Wolverines the 
upper hand in what will likely 
be a low-scoring matchup.

No. 10 Louisville
If 
Michigan 
makes 
the 

quarterfinals 
on 
Sunday, 
it 

will play the winner of the 

match between Louisville and 
Northwestern.

The 
Cardinals 
advanced 

to 
the 
finals 
of 
the 
ACC 

Tournament, upsetting No. 2 
Duke, 3-2, in the semifinals 
despite being outshot, 31-8. In 
the finals, they lost to North 
Carolina, 1-0, but received an 
at-large bid with a 14-7 record. 
The Cardinals, who are hosting 
the semifinal and final rounds 
of the tournament, fared better 
than Syracuse in conference 
play with a 4-2 record.

Junior goalkeeper Ayeisha 

McFerran, who had a career-
high 18 saves against Duke, and 
senior midfielder Nicole Woods 
were both named to the All-ACC 
First Team. Despite its impact 
players, however, the team has 
a middling offense and defense. 
The Cardinals rank 26th in the 
nation in goals-against average 

and 35th in scoring average. 
They managed only one shutout 
during 
the 
regular 
season 

— against unranked Central 
Michigan — and their scoring 
margin was lower than all but 
one team in the tournament.

But 
Louisville 
has 
come 

through in big games, defeating 
Syracuse and Duke in the ACC 
Tournament. It also played in 
the toughest conference in field 
hockey, meaning that despite 
lackluster stats, the Cardinals 
could 
fare 
well 
against 

teams 
from 
less-competitive 

conferences. Still, most teams 
that are able to make it far in the 
NCAA Tournament stand out on 
either offense or defense, if not 
both. Because the Cardinals do 
neither, they’ll need some more 
big-game magic to keep their 
season going.

No. 9 Northwestern

Northwestern 
made 
it 
to 

the semifinals of the Big Ten 
Tournament, beating No. 20 
Rutgers in the quarterfinals 
before 
falling 
to 
Michigan, 

3-0. The Wildcats received an 
at-large bid with an overall 
record of 14-6 (6-2 Big Ten). 
Northwestern easily dispatched 
lower-ranked 
opponents 
but 

struggled 
against 
tougher 

competition, losing to every top-
10 team it faced except then-No. 
10 Maryland.

The strength of the Wildcats 

lies with three game-changing 
players. Senior defender Sophia 
Miller was one of only three 
unanimous selections to the 
All-Big Ten First Team. Junior 
midfielder Puck Pentenga also 
made the first team and was 
fifth in the nation in assists per 
game. Junior forward Pascale 
Massey, Northwestern’s most 

prolific goal-scorer, was named 
to the second team.

Pentenga and Massey lead 

a high-powered offense that 
ranks 12th nationally in goals 
per game, a feat that is even 
more 
impressive 
considering 

many of the teams ahead of them 
came 
from 
less-competitive 

conferences. 
However, 
the 

defense has at times left a 
little to be desired — only two 
tournament teams allowed more 
goals per game — which could 
explain the Wildcats’ struggles 
against 
top 
competition. 

In 
Louisville, 
however, 

Northwestern 
faces 
a 
team 

that has struggled offensively 
and one it has already defeated 
in the regular season, 2-0. 
With a strong foundation in 
Miller, Pentenga and Massey, 
Northwestern has the pieces to 
repeat that result.

‘M’ defensemen striving for consistency

Wherever Mel Pearson goes, 

offense follows. 

When Pearson became the 

head coach at Michigan Tech in 
2011, the Huskies were coming 
off a 4-30-4 campaign in which 
they averaged just 1.97 goals and 
24.9 shots per game. But after 
only one season, the Huskies 
were outshooting opponents and 
scoring nearly one more goal 
per contest than they had the 
previous year.

As the head coach of the 

Michigan hockey team, Pearson 
has worked similar wonders. The 
Wolverines have gone from 51st 
in the country in shot attempts in 
2016-17 to fourth this season and 
are tied for 10th in scoring.

Pearson’s 
teams 
have 

always been quick to grasp his 
up-tempo brand of hockey. While 
watching 
sophomore 
forward 

Will Lockwood blast down the 
ice or the first line of seniors 
Dexter Dancs, Tony Calderone 
and junior Cooper Marody work 
in perfect harmony, it’s easy to 
forget all about last season.

For 
Michigan’s 
defense, 

however, the learning process 
hasn’t been quite as smooth.

“We’ve got to buy in and make 

a total commitment to team 
defense,” Pearson said after the 
Wolverines’ 5-4 loss to Penn State 
on Oct. 27. “We’ll score goals; 
we’ve got enough guys that can 
score goals. But we’ve got to play 
a lot better defensively.”

Michigan allowed three goals 

in the third period and overtime 
of that contest, as well as 54 
shots on goal. The following day, 
Pearson and the coaching staff 
arranged 
a 
longer-than-usual 

video session, which involved 
watching the game’s last five 
minutes and identifying defensive 
mistakes. This paid off, as the 
Wolverines rebounded with a 
5-2 win over the Nittany Lions to 
split the series.

“The 
last 
three 
goals 
in 

last night’s game, we had the 
puck possession and we just 
gave it away. Just poor puck 
management,” 
Pearson 
said 

after that game. “We (watched 

video) not to be overly critical 
or to pick on anyone but just as a 
learning process going forward, 
so when we get in a tough game 
somewhere down the line, we can 
play with that composure.”

But 
giveaways 
in 
the 

defensive zone have still plagued 
Michigan. Against Ferris State 
last Thursday, the Wolverines 
allowed just two goals, and both 
came as a result of avoidable 
turnovers — junior defenseman 
Nicholas Boka slipped and lost 
control of the puck, and Ferris 
State 
forward 
Lucas 
Finner 

stole the puck from sophomore 
forward Jake Slaker to score the 
Bulldogs’ second goal.

Pearson 
understands 
that 

eliminating 
what 
he 
terms 

“unforced errors” won’t happen 
overnight, and that one strong 
performance 
doesn’t 
mean 

that process is complete. On 
Thursday, he chalked many of 
the Wolverines’ defensive lapses 
up to the competitiveness of the 
blueliners in always wanting to 
make an outstanding play, even if 
one isn’t available.

“Just 
watched 
an 
NHL 

game this weekend and those 
defensemen, 
(if) 
they 
don’t 

have a play, they just gotta get 
it out and live for another day,” 
Pearson said. “I think that’s one 
of the big things. We have to just 

understand the situation.”

The 
Wolverines 
do 
have 

defensemen with the ability to 
contribute on offense — freshman 
Quinn Hughes, junior Joseph 
Cecconi and senior Sam Piazza 
have all tallied at least four points.

But 
priority 
number 
one 

still lies in the defensive zone, 
as Pearson has used statistics 
as motivation for the unit to 
perform.

“You call them together as 

a group to take pride in our 
statistics 
nationally,” 
Pearson 

said. “It’s a good reflection on your 
defensemen, your goals-against. 
... We want to encourage them to 
do some things offensively but we 
want to be rock-solid defensively.”

Sophomore defenseman Luke 

Martin — one half of Michigan’s 
top 
defensive 
pairing, 
along 

with Hughes — also stressed 
developing a rapport with other 
defensemen as a unit is key for 
improvement.

“It’s a lot in practice and a lot 

in preparation, but the big key for 
me is communication,” Martin 
said. “Always talking with your 
partner, always dissecting shifts 
or plays and whatever it is and 
just getting on the same page and 
getting used to the way people 
play. Quinn and I — we’ve been 
talking so much and I think it 
shows that our chemistry and our 

togetherness. It’s gotten so much 
better and I think we still have so 
much left to build on.”

The aspect of chemistry has 

been hugely important to Pearson 
as well. While the Wolverines 
may lack experience or veteran 
presence in many areas, defense is 
not one of them, and Pearson has 
taken advantage of this, going as 
far as seating underclassmen next 
to upperclassmen in the locker 
room to aid their development.

“A lot of these guys won the Big 

Ten championship a couple years 
ago,” Pearson said. “So they’ve 
been through it, they understand 
what you need to do to have 
success and win championships. 
They have it, they experienced, it, 
they earned it. They understand 
what it takes. Even during the 
game, most players, they’re sitting 
right next to each other, they 
can add some advice to them or 
even in the locker room between 
periods and all these practices.”

Michigan’s 
transformation 

into one of the most dynamic 
offenses in the country took 
place quite rapidly. Building 
consistency behind this attack, 
however, has taken a bit longer. 
But 
through 
communication, 

video sessions and a strong focus 
on the defensive zone, Pearson 
and the Wolverines believe that 
stability will emerge in time.

MEN’S BASKETBALL
Wolverines emphasize 
improvement on glass

Going into the 2017-18 season, 

the Michigan men’s basketball 
team has some well-documented 
concerns. 

Questions 
of 
Duncan 

Robinson’s 
defense, 
Charles 

Matthews’ shooting ability and 
the 
Wolverines’ 
point 
guard 

competition were the focal points 
of preseason media availabilities. 

But one area of concern that 

has gotten little attention is the 
lack of proven rebounding ability 
Michigan returns this year.

According to UM Hoops, the 

Wolverines return just 40 percent 
of its defensive rebounding from 
a season ago, hurt by the losses of 
D.J. Wilson, Derrick Walton Jr. 
and Zak Irvin – last season’s top 
three rebounders.

That showed in last Friday’s 

exhibition 
when 
Michigan 

allowed Grand Valley State to grab 
15 offensive rebounds and score 17 
second-chance points. 

It’s only November – sure. 

But that statistic isn’t exactly 
encouraging, especially given the 
relative size of the opposition. Of 
the Lakers who played significant 
minutes, only one was taller than 
6-foot-6 – center Drake Baar.

Compare that to what the 

Wolverines will see on a nightly 
basis in the Big Ten. Michigan 
State, for example, features three 
players over 6-foot-8 in its starting 
lineup.

Against larger teams, a lack of 

defensive rebounders could come 
back to bite more noticeably than 
it did in Friday’s 82-50 rout, and 
Michigan realizes this.

“We 
gotta 
do 
better 
on 

defensive rebounds,” said fifth-
year senior point guard Jaaron 
Simmons. “We had a lot of long 
rebounds, so us as guards, we 
gotta help on that.”

Added 
John 
Beilein: 

“(Defensive 
rebounding) 
is 

obviously a concern for us. A lot 
of them were hustle plays, too. 
(Grand Valley State) did a great job 
with that, and fought really hard.”

To limit those second-chance 

opportunities, 
Beilein 
said 

rebounding is a focus of practice 
this week. One of his favorite drills 
– called “takeaways” – emphasizes 
physicality and assertiveness in 
crashing the boards.

“It’s great touching point for 

us to say, ‘This is what we have, 
and now we’ve got to continue to 
emphasize it,’ ” Beilein said. “You 
can emphasize it in practice all day 
long, and you start play in games – 
you’ve got to see in games.”

One player who has already 

displayed a knack for rebounding 
is 
junior 
forward 
Charles 

Matthews. Though he collected 
a mundane four rebounds Friday, 
his hustle and knowledge of the 
glass was evident.

With just over six minutes 

remaining in the first half, 
Matthews jutted into the paint, 
got inside position and grabbed 
the rebound off a missed free 
throw attempt from freshman 
point guard Eli Brooks. Matthews 
then 
looked 
up 
and 
found 

Robinson on the perimeter for an 
open three.

Matthews says he has always 

been that type of player – 
searching for loose balls and 
looking to capitalize off missed 
shots.

“When I was younger, nobody 

passed me the ball, and I wanted 
to score,” Matthews said. “So I just 
said, ‘I’m going to get the rebound 
and go back up with it.’ That’s just 
a natural knack I have – just going 
up and trying to get the ball. And 
coaches are stressing on me to 
do it even more and continue to 
rebound.”

Still, Matthews won’t always be 

there to take advantage of every 
missed shot. He knows the perils 
of giving up too many offensive 
boards – like Michigan did in its 
only exhibition.

“A lot of them was long, 

granted,” Matthews said. “Still, 
we can’t let a team – I don’t 
care who they are – get 15 
offensive rebounds. That could 
be potentially dangerous. We’ll 
correct.”

Third period inconsistencies
holding ‘M’ back from sweeps

Following a dramatic, come-

from-behind win against Vermont 
on Oct. 21, Michigan hockey coach 
Mel Pearson said his skaters had 
started to establish themselves as 
a “third-period team.”

The next Friday at No. 19 Penn 

State, the Wolverines (5-3-0) 
had two one-goal leads in the 
final period, only to allow two 
Nittany Lion equalizers to force 
overtime and eventually secure 
a 5-4 Penn State victory. But the 
subsequent night was a different 
story, as Michigan scored two 
goals within 74 seconds early in 
the third, winning the game 5-2 
and splitting the series.

Last Thursday, the Wolverines 

reverted 
to 
their 
new, 
self-

proclaimed 
identity 
against 

Ferris State. What initially looked 
like a nail-biter over the first 40 
minutes — with the Bulldogs one 
breakaway from tying or leading 
the game — quickly turned into 
target practice for Michigan come 
the third period.

After sloppy play on both sides 

of the puck — including being 
outshot 11 to nine in the second 
period — and a 1-1 stalemate after 
two 
periods, 
the 
Wolverines 

finally broke loose early and often 
in the final stanza. Michigan 
controlled possession time within 
the offensive zone, put 26 shots on 
net and scored four unanswered 
goals, sealing a 7-2 routing.

However, 
the 
next 
night 

again 
showcased 
late-game 

inconsistency. With a chance for 
its second straight home sweep, 
the 
Wolverines 
outshot 
the 

Bulldogs 12 to five and scored 
on a power play in the same 
frame. Nevertheless, Ferris State 
responded with the tying goal 
and eventually left Ann Arbor 
with a 3-2 overtime triumph and 
shocking series split.

Through 
eight 
games, 
13 

of Michigan’s 28 goals have 
come in the third period. But 
the 
squandered 
late 
scoring 

opportunities have slowly started 
to equal those capped off by goal 
flurries.

Despite the similar feel of yet 

another third period dominated 
by the Wolverines, the results 
were starkly different in the 
stunning loss to the Bulldogs. 
Pearson faults an inability to 
capitalize on quality chances in 
the third period as a major reason 
for a disappointing end to the 
series.

“When you look at the shots 

and shots attempted, I think we 
did a pretty good job taking the 
play to them,” Pearson said after 
Friday’s loss. “I think the shots 
were 22 to 12 and the ‘grade-A’s’ 
would be maybe six or seven to 
one, so I liked our third period.

“We were a little soft in our 

zone on their second goal, the 
tying goal, defensively. We have 
to engage a little bit harder, a little 
bit more aggressive, but we didn’t. 
And then they got a quick pass and 
a goal. But I liked our third period 
— I can’t tell you we had a poor 
third period — but we just have to 
finish. We had great chances and 
it’s going to bother me watching 
the game back and watching the 
missed opportunities.”

Though the team failed to 

execute Friday, Pearson holds 
confidence his team will continue 
to play with high energy down 
the stretch. He cites the presence 
of experienced upperclassmen as 
a catalyst for a recent, locked-in 
focus in the final period.

“I think our leadership is really 

good,” Pearson said last Thursday. 
“They’re doing a good job of 
keeping the team in the moment. 
We can as coaches ask them to do 
that, but we’ve got some real good 
leaders and (that) extends to our 
coaches in the locker room. Just 
calm everything down, there’s 
a certain way we need to play to 
have success in the third period 
and we document that. Short 
shifts, manage the puck, play with 
discipline, a lot of things and if we 
can do that, we’re going to have 
success in the third period.

“We’ve got enough guys who 

can score. If you play on the right 
side of the puck, check the other 
team, you’re going to get your 
opportunities, especially when 
they have to start pressing. For the 
most part we did a good job, but 
we still have to get better. I know 
we’re only seven games in and I 
expect this to be in midseason 
form, but lots of really good things 
going on.”

Junior 
defenseman 
Luke 

Martin 
agrees 
with 
Pearson 

about the importance of veteran 
leadership, but doesn’t see his 
approach and composure change 
from period to period.

“I’m a solid steady presence 

back there,” Martin said. “I think 
I just continue to bring that in the 
third and hopefully be a little bit 
of calming influence on some of 
the younger guys. We just keep 
going forward and playing every 
shift like it’s going to make or 
break the game. And I think that’s 
just an important mentality in the 
third.”

Closing out games in dominant 

fashion starts and ends with 
prevailing on defense, an area 
that still needs to be improved, 
Pearson and players concur — 
especially with No. 4 Minnesota 
(7-3-0) 
and 
its 
high-octane 

offense traveling to Ann Arbor 
this weekend.

The Wolverines allowed just 

five goals in the third period 
this season, but all came at 
precious times and some off 
avoidable 
defensive 
miscues. 

They ultimately cost Michigan 
two straight sweeps against Penn 
State and Ferris State.

Even with the hot Golden 

Gophers in town, the Wolverines 
expect to post impressive third 
period showings, stemming from 
a re-energized spark Pearson 
believes his team possesses late 
in contests. But it’s a matter of 
exploiting scoring chances that 
will be the difference between a 
sweep for either team and a split 
against one of the Big Ten’s — and 
NCAA’s — best.

FOOTBALL
Glasgow key for ‘M’
special teams unit

Like many Wolverines before 

him, redshirt sophomore Jordan 
Glasgow is making the move from 
special teams standout to defensive 
contributor. In the words of Chase 
Winovich, “Jordan’s a beast.” 

Glasgow, who plays defensive 

back when he’s not defending kick 
returns, walked out as the special 
teams captain last weekend against 
Minnesota, a testament to his 
performance the week prior versus 
Rutgers.

He made one solo tackle while 

playing safety against the Scarlet 
Knights and followed that up with 
a career-high three tackles that day 
against the Golden Gophers. His 
success has helped boost a special 
teams unit that is one of the best in 
the nation.

Michigan (4-2 Big Ten, 7-2 overall) 

hasn’t allowed a single kick return to 
go for a touchdown this season and 
allows an average of just 14.59 yards 
per return — the No. 3 best kick 
return defense in the country.

“We have good game setups, 

we have good plans every game 
and we have people that want to go 
down there and make a play, and 
I think that’s the most important 
thing,” Glasgow said. “If people 
run down there, think it’s going 
to be a touchback and slow down, 
it just gives the return team an 
opportunity.”

That’s not an issue for Michigan, 

though, 
because 
according 
to 

Glasgow, 
everyone 
sprinting 

downfield on kickoffs wants to make 
the big hit.

Many of those players aspire to 

play more consistently on offense 
and defense, so when they line up 
on special teams, that’s their time to 
stand out.

Redshirt junior linebacker Noah 

Furbush and Winovich, a redshirt 
junior defensive end, both spent 
most of their earlier years on special 

teams, but now play on defense full-
time.

Winovich starts at his position, 

and Furbush rotates along with 
the other linebackers, but when 
they were sophomores, they were 
basically kickoff specialists.

“I knew every single thing those 

kick returners did,” Winovich said. 
“The way they set up. The way they 
turned. I learned a lot about scouting 
people from that year. It was kind of 
just doing everything perfect, doing 
your assignment and trying to make 
big plays.

“Going down there and putting 

somebody on their butt, being 
consistent, playing hard — showing 
that you’re an animal.”

Added 
Furbush: 
“Everybody 

has got a role on the team, and 
everybody’s got to do that role to the 
best of their abilities.”

Glasgow is doing just that. 

After leading the Wolverines with 
12 special teams tackles in 2016, 
he focused this offseason on the 
improvements that would make him 
a better candidate at defensive back.

For a safety, Glasgow admits that 

he’s a bit slow. He made a conscious 
effort to become faster before this 
season started, focusing on all the 
workouts that the strength and 
conditioning coaches plan for the 
team.

“As long as you go through those, 

you give your entire effort and you 
give everything you have, you’re 
going to get better no matter what,” 
Glasgow said. “I just put all the effort 
I could into the plan that the coaches 
put together for me, and that helped 
develop me as a safety and defensive 
player.”

Now, Glasgow is in the room with 

the safeties. He’s starting to put stats 
in the pass break up column, and he’s 
continuing to add to his tackles total.

“Jordan does it every game,” 

Winovich said. “He’s been doing it. 
It’s one of those things, you do it for 
a while, and finally other people start 
to catch on. That’s Jordan.”

Robbins setting high expectations for himself

Brad Robbins’ dad got a call two 

weeks before signing day. 

On the other end? None other 

than Jim Harbaugh.

“My dad goes, ‘Oh hey, Jim!’ 

His voice cracked,” Robbins said 
Tuesday night. “It was priceless. Me 
and my brother were sitting in the 
other room just making fun of him.”

Now Michigan’s starting punter 

as a freshman, Robbins still recalled 
the conversation fondly almost one 
year later. How could he not? After 
all, he admitted he was “pretty 
shocked” the Wolverines even came 
calling.

But Harbaugh did. Then Chris 

Partridge and Jay Harbaugh visited 
his school. And on Feb. 1, Robbins 
faxed his national letter of intent 
to Ann Arbor — a tidy ending to a 
whirlwind recruitment.

“It all happened so fast,” he said. 

“It was unbelievable. I’m just happy 
I’m here.”

Originally, Robbins had picked 

Nevada after attending the team’s 
kicking camp before his senior 

season. But the Wolfpack finished 
5-7 last year. The day after their 
season ended, head coach Brian 
Polian was let go along with the rest 
of his staff.

Robbins promptly decommitted 

— and began the recruitment 
process all over again.

Coaches weren’t able to reach out 

in the immediate aftermath because 
it was a dead period. So he took the 
initiative, attending more camps to 
gain exposure and hopefully a late 
offer.

It was a stressful time. His future 

was uncertain. But Robbins said he 
tried to stay level-headed.

“My parents gave me good 

advice,” 
Robbins 
said. 
“They 

reassured 
me 
that 
something 

would happen. I could walk-on 
somewhere, something was going to 
happen.”

Around January, a couple Big 

Ten schools reached out. Robbins 
spent nearly an entire month 
on the road, visiting unfamiliar 
campuses. Meanwhile, a couple 
kicking coaches he knew talked to 
Michigan’s staff and recommended 
his name. Then came the call from 

Harbaugh, and everything fell into 
place.

It didn’t take long for Robbins to 

make an impact for his new team, 
either. By the Purdue game, he had 
earned the starting job. For a team 
with an offense that has sputtered at 
times, Robbins takes part in crucial 
battles for field position. On the 
season, he’s punted 37 times with an 
average of 40.8 yards.

Robbins 
feels 
like 
he 
has 

played “decent.” But he has higher 
expectations for himself.

“I want to average like 60 yards, if 

I can,” Robbins said. “Over the past 
few games, I feel alright. But I don’t 
feel satisfied. I want to become more 
consistent. I want to help the defense 
out as much as I can. I want to put 
them in a really good position.”

Robbins’ numbers may not leap 

off the stat sheet. But what he has 
done is somewhat remarkable 
considering the transition he faced 
going to college. For one, Westerville 
South 
High 
School, 
situated 

northeast of Columbus, never had a 
special teams coordinator.

“I showed my coach in high 

school, I was like, ‘Look, I can do 

a pooch punt, I can go directional 
(punting),’ ” Robbins recalled, 
laughing. “ ‘No, just kick the crap out 
the ball.’ That was my high school 
advice.

“It changed when I got here. 

Expectations were way up here — 
especially with Kenny Allen leaving 
and him being as good as he was.”

Expectations from his fellow 

special teams members are higher, 
too. Robbins has developed a 
friendly 
rivalry 
with 
redshirt 

freshman kicker Quinn Nordin.

“We constantly chip at each 

other,” Robbins said. “We go back 
and forth. … I told him I’m going 
to kick field goals. He told me he’s 
going to take my job. It’s all good 
fun. He has a boot. He has a big leg, 
too.”

Nordin and his fellow kickers 

can dream of knocking in game-
winning field goals. Robbins? He has 
other aspirations: placing a “perfect 
pooch punt” at the one-yard line, 
laying out a returner on the sideline 
and running for a touchdown after a 
bad snap.

Of course, that last scenario might 

give Michigan fans some pause.

Now I am become

What’s in a name?
Nothing if you can’t remember it.
Ah-hem.

A first date should be:

-Punctual
-Unusual
-Fun (not merely enjoyable)
-Long
-A fantastic production of “Henry IV, Part 1” followed by a few glasses 

of wine and extensive discussions of our favorite musicians that dissolves 
into a sloppy kiss sing-along

The lady doth not protest

Second date ideas:
-A walk in the park
-Grabbing coffee
-Comparing favorite Radiolab episodes on the cold walk to a warm

each other’s bodies

Now is the winter of utter contentment.

A third date

I could find eternity here,

My worries and fears miles away —
there is an incomprehensible beauty to the fire that burns from within your crevices,

I have wondered about you

Am I the new person drawn toward you?

But before I step further, should I take warning?

For I know —

you may not be what I expect.

But what is it I expect?

Do I expect you to fit some ideal?

Do I think it so easy for us to weave? Together?

Do I think your friendship will be endless satisfaction?

A marathon of blissful confirmation bias?

 
Will I see no further than my impression of you?

Can you ever be, in my mind or heart or body, even

thicker than two dimensions?

And will it shock me when you try

to break into the third?

 
And I wonder

if when I step forward to embrace you,

my arms are wrapped around mystery —*

do I believe in this mirage?

Believe you are a knowable thing?

That you will be the caregiver, the challenger

I envision for myself?

 

And I have wondered if it may all be maya, illusion.

This poem is a reformulation of Walt Whitman’s “Are you the new 

person drawn toward me?”

*This line and the line above borrows phrasing from Rebecca Solnit’s 

A Field Guide to Getting Lost.

The Urge

 
to tattle on her.

Be too grown up to bother.

Choke on laughter —

let it bust out my eyes.

 
Glimpse my hair in every mirror.

Curtain every reflective crack.

Call Mom.

Hit ignore.

Surprise them all —

because I’m consistent for once.

 
Sketch the Eiffel Tower —

the Liberty Bell —

research the Duke of Wellington

and build him a monument too.

Fall back asleep.

 
Monogram my purse.

Erase every material trace.

Pluck a wild mushroom and taste it.

Spit it out!

Swallow!

Let the poison slink through me —

nibble every day till I’m immune.

Barter for a bike.

Fix it up and ride it

to farmers markets and rallies.

Sip on the blue curacao sky.

Autumn’s Dying Women

Short Fiction

b y Z o y a G u r m, LSA Junior

T

he only member of my fam-
ily who ever believed in souls 
was my aunt. “Bless your 
soul,” she wrote every year in 

her sloppy and smudged cursive, directly 
under the pre-printed birthday message. 
She died late-summer, a lonely and child-
less death, colored like deep pink wild-
flowers and her un-beating heart. I don’t 
know how she died, I never asked. I just 
knew I had to start believing in souls.

***
This past autumn was desolate. My 

mother was depressed after her sister’s 
untimely death. I hadn’t reconnected 
with any friends I had fallen out of con-
tact with in the summertime; their lives 
progressed without wondering about me. 
I spent most of my day sleeping and rare-
ly attended class. I lived in my own two-
room apartment and, with the supplies 
my aunt had willed to me, used one room 
as a studio. I slept in the kitchen, read 
in the empty bathtub and left the heater 
buzzing as days grew colder and colder.

I can’t pretend like I’ve ever known 

how to paint. I seldom used the studio 
for anything but sitting and staring, at 
blank canvas or out the small window. 
When I felt most alone I’d bring a boy 
to my apartment and we’d use the stu-
dio couch because my bed in the kitchen 
smelled like oil and cheese. Any time I’d 
try to paint I’d abandon the canvas for 
other pursuits. I’d stare at the unfinished 
work until it drove me mad and I hated 
each stitch of it, and then I’d dispose of it, 
burn it or throw it into the dumpster and 
watch it sink between bags of trash, soak-
ing up the most disdainful smells.

I called home less and less because I 

couldn’t handle the long silences from my 
mother. She must’ve thought I was get-
ting busier, if she thought of me at all. I 
wasn’t sad. I was feeling something new.

Now, the days are shorter like my 

prayers are being answered — I sleep 
more and time has the illusion of pass-
ing quickly. I’ve stopped bringing people 
home, I’ve stopped staring at unpainted 
canvases. I feel such hostility from the 
studio door that I won’t even enter.

My mother has filled the spaces my 

aunt and I held in her calculated life. I 
imagine the conversations she must have 
about me at her office parties or with our 
distant relatives. I imagine her thin smile 
and uniform responses, her insistence 
that everything is and has always been 

OK.

I failed half of my exams and have been 

wondering how ashamed she would be 
if I dropped out altogether; I could find 
someone to marry and live off love, or I 
could stay in this adamant apartment for 
the rest of time.

There are worse things I could do to 

her. I could die.

***
My aunt’s funeral was daunting. It was 

held in a wide wooden room, only four 
of 50 seats filled: one for me, one for my 
mother, one for her work colleague — 
an uncomfortable woman who sweated 
right through her tight black dress, who 
despite her grieving gestures and pious 
tongue was the first to rush out the door 
— and one for a man whom I had never 
seen before — who shed a single tear and 
spoke to the casket with a heavy foreign 
tongue, a one-sided conversation that 
whispered through the wooden room 
like poetry. My mother had thrown the 
funeral and invited plenty — none had 
shown except the woman. The man had 
not been invited. My mother said a few 
words. I said a few to the room and cried 
only because the empty chairs sang my 
speech back to me. The man shook my 
hand at the service, after the woman had 
left and while my mother spoke to those 
who worked at the home. We said noth-
ing, but we meant a lot. I don’t think he 
was fluent in English, but he understood 
enough.

***
A week ago, I received a complaint 

that the stenches of my apartment have 
begun to seep through the walls and into 
my neighbor’s rooms. The smell must’ve 
come from my kitchen, where unwashed 
dishes rattled against one another in the 
sink. Old milk and crumbs from weeks of 
breakfasts, lunches and dinners formed 
a thin film at the bottom. When I heard 
that the landlord was coming to inspect 
the source of the apparently repugnant 
smell, I scrubbed the kitchen counters 
and threw out any expired food, spraying 
old perfumes my mother had given me 
three Christmases ago to stifle the scent. 
I’m not sure whether it worked.

My landlord is a thin, lanky man who 

wears navy leather shoes. His apart-
ments are not high-end by any means, but 
he makes a steady living ripping off stu-
dents desperate for a place to stay. He’s 
not a bad man. Sometimes I see him as he 

steps outside to smoke, and we have brief 
conversations. He barely remembers my 
name but often hands out advice, wheez-
ing between drags.

“You paint?” he asks me, his long neck 

craned through the doorframe of my stu-
dio. I haven’t been in there for weeks. 
The smells of oil paint and sloppy sex 
have been brewing for months and now 
all hit at once.

“When I have the time.”
“Yeah, I’m sure this is the culprit.” 

He inhales deeply to prove a point. The 
wooden floorboards creak underneath 
his pacing.

The smell makes me nauseated and 

nostalgic and I want him to leave. He 
begins poking through the unpacked 
boxes I have stacked against the wall. 
Some are full of dirty palettes and brush-
es. Others hold unfinished canvases or 
sketches I find too raw and alive to attri-
bute to my aunt. I can’t bring myself to 
look at them. He leafs through them with 
his skinny fingers, decorated with silver 
rings of varying thickness.

“You did these?”
I nod.
He pulls one from the stack to exam-

ine. I’m uncomfortable that he’s looking 
through my aunt’s work — his prying eyes 
are capturing the single lifeline I still 
have to her. I start to say something, but 
the painting he chooses is one I’ve never 
seen before; it’s a deep and vibrant pink, 
abstract and unfinished. The colors are 
concentrated to the sides of the paint-
ing, but they lean toward the center, as 
if the intention was to move in. The first 
moment I see its riveting texture, under 
the impure light of the small studio 
window, with the uncovered stitches of 
off-white canvas shining through, sten-
ciled with light pencil marks so crisp 
and intentional that I can picture the 
crease between my aunt’s thick, arched 
eyebrows as she made them, my eyes fill 
with tears. I have never seen my aunt as 
an artist — I’d never seen her studio or 
her work — but this painting evokes such 
a recognition of her, the little bits that 
I saw. I feel as though I’m looking at a 
portrait of the artist herself. In a quiet, 
persistent voice, I ask my landlord if he is 
ready to leave.

On his way out, he suggests wash-

ing the supplies or opening some more 
windows, but can’t reprimand me — I’m 
allowed to have my makeshift studio, and 

the smell, albeit greasy, isn’t particularly 
discerning.

***
My aunt was my mother’s only sibling. 

She rarely visited us though she lived 
nearby. My mother always told me she 
was a busy woman, between her jobs and 
hobbies and brief but invested relation-
ships.

Though I seldom saw or heard from 

her directly, she was constantly a pres-
ence in our home. On any given day, my 
mother would spend hours on our land-
line, deep in discussion with my aunt as 
if some new event of great importance 
had occurred every 24 hours. I’d return 
home from school and shut the door qui-
etly to not disturb their long, endless 
talks. My mother would press our chunky 
home phone to her ear as she cooked or 
cleaned or sat on the bottom step of our 
carpeted staircase. In our echoing house 
I would hear her laugh and curse; her 
tense shoulders would relax each time 
our home phone began to ring. I imag-
ined my aunt on the other side of the 
line. I used the short, dashing details of 
her life my mother would recount to me; 
I understood that my aunt was an eccen-
tric woman, picking up painting and 
sketching after a messy divorce with a 
man she had married far too quickly. She 
was attractive in her youth and carried 
her beauty as she aged. My mother had 
been jealous of her as a child.

I could picture my aunt’s manicured 

fingers clutching her steering wheel, a 
cigarette in one hand and her cellphone 
sandwiched between her shoulder and 
chin. Maybe she called from her apart-
ment in the center of town, lounging 
on her plush sofa, flipping through a 
magazine. Or perhaps she called from 
different places every time, like the bath-
rooms of brief lovers or hotel lobbies as 
she traveled to art shows in small cities, 
attracting crowds of connoisseurs and 
eagle-eyed critics alike. But these were 
all fantasies. I didn’t know if she was a 
smoker or if her work was ever displayed 
in any shows, I just liked the thought of 
it.

***
I enter the studio. It’s evening. The 

end of sunset pours through the win-
dow. When I went to class this morning, 
for one of the first times this week, I let 
my apartment air out, following my land-
lord’s advice. It still smells foul, so foul.

Last night I laid my aunt’s unfinished 

pink painting on my studio couch before I 
went to bed. It’s still here. The colors are 
warmer under the evening sunlight, the 
white space is whiter than I remember it 
being yesterday. It’s a compelling paint-
ing. It has the color and texture of my 
mother’s voice as she spoke to my aunt on 
the phone. It has a wholesomeness that 
has been on my mind the whole day — it 
has a life so colorful that it can talk for 
hours and hours. It has stirred up a faint 
regret. I never heard those stories, even 
when I had the chance.

I pace the room. Autumn has ended. 

Winter is sharp outside my window. 
I miss my aunt and I miss my mother. 
They left my life together, I can feel them 
somewhere in this color.

My aunt’s oil paints 

are stacked in white 
cardboard 
boxes, 

torn and stamped and 
labeled by the U.S. 
Postal Service. The 
orange ones are on 
top. I reach for them. 
I don’t know how to 
compare brushes, so 
I just take a medium-
sized one. There is 
masking tape around 
the handle. The bris-
tles are glued together 
with purplish paint.

My floor is surpris-

ingly cold when I press 
my thighs against it. I 
lay the canvas flat in 
front of me. I scruti-
nize the pencil marks, 
where they have been 
erased, where they are 
the darkest. I squeeze 
a pea-sized drop of 
paint onto a heavily 
used palette.

The painting before 

me is unfinished, but 
I know what it is. It 
has the character my 
mother forbade from our home — a pro-
vocative swing of the hips, a womanly 
tenderness. I begin to paint, adding more 
and more to my palette as I go, oranges 
then pinks then reds and blacks. I start 
cautious, within a dead woman’s lines. I 
want to do her justice. I am painting her 
soul.

***
I wasn’t sure what to say to my moth-

er when I saw her the morning after the 
funeral. Her eyes were bloodshot and her 
cold, veiny hands clenched around our 
home phone. There was no one to call. 
She looked up at me. Her eyes dripped 
streams, reddish against her discolored 
skin.

Growing up, my mother never let me 

see her cry. Too many emotions were 
distracting, she taught me. I have vivid 
memories of her turning away, sheltering 
her aging face. She’d lock her bedroom 

door with a sharp, metallic click, and I’d 
stand in front of it, in anguish. She was on 
one side and I was on another. That’s how 
it would always be. It was like that when 
she separated from my father. It was like 
that when my father’s truck flipped over, 
his abusive neck cracked against the 
asphalt. It was like that at the end of any 
sad movie.

I dropped my eyes to the floor and 

retreated from the room, not one word 
of comfort or empathy from my chapped 
lips.

We didn’t speak that day or that week. 

She fixed me meals but rarely ate any-
thing herself. Our home was dead silent, 
she would sob at the calls of telemarket-
ers.

***

It was early autumn when my mother 

began to ship boxes to me. The will had 
been read a month before, but my mother 
was reluctant. My aunt’s paintings were 
masks for promiscuity, for unconven-
tionality. I was promised my aunt had 
not always been that way — it was a turn 
in her life, one that I had not seen either 
side of. Could my mother damn me to 
that? After a cold month of debating, the 
boxes came in, one by one. My mother 
grew thinner.

The boxes lined the walls of my apart-

ment, the empty room that would become 
my studio. Supplies littered the kitchen 
counter, unfinished artwork remained 
packed away. Caterpillars ate through 
stitches of blank canvas like leaves. I 
didn’t mind.

The end of September, I would call my 

mother daily, just to be silent with her. I 
could picture her curling up in her bed-

room, her weak fingers holding a phone 
with no one to call or love. I would some-
times talk to her, about my life as it was, 
but would receive no response.

It was October when I realized how 

alone I was. My routines withered. My 
studio became a haven for sorrow and 
detachment, for boys from classes I didn’t 
attend and ugly portraits of women I used 
to admire. I was promiscuous, unconven-
tional.

In November, my mother’s phone calls 

became unbearable. I shouted at her to 
respond to me but only received silence.

Winter began to roll in. I decided I 

couldn’t enter my studio anymore. Spite 
piled against the door. Caterpillars died in 
their brown cocoons. My mother discon-
nected our home phone.

I’ve spent most of the evenings this week 

in the studio.

I don’t always paint. Sometimes I look 

deep into the colors my aunt painted and 
think of her soft skin. Her heart-shaped 
face grew a pink-brown when she spoke. 
She wore lipstick the color of her natural 
lips. I look into the colors I’ve painted too — 
they’re darker, like the cold foreign eyes of 
the man at the funeral, like the heavy gray 
skin my mother wore those last days of sum-
mer.

When I do paint, time passes with ease. 

It never stutters. It is articulate. I feel more 
alive behind those studio doors than I have 
with any of those boys on my couch. My soul 
loosens in my body. The cold of the floor still 
stings my legs when I first sit, but by the 
time I’m done, there is warmth in the walls, 
warmth through the light fixtures, warmth 
in my fingertips. My arms and legs carry 
their own colors. I take long showers and 

watch the paints fuse together as they wash 
down the drain.

Souls have wants, souls have needs. I 

think about my aunt as an entity, some-
where wide and unreachable. I figure that’s 
how she’d want to be remembered. Deep 
pink, orange, tender. My aunt’s soul was 
never clear to me when she was alive but 
she’s here, in the studio lights and the dried 
paint that cakes the hair on my arms. I try to 
picture how my soul looks, how it accumu-
lates in colors and textures.

My mother wouldn’t believe in things 

like these. In grief, she is certain not to 
pour herself into spirituality. She’s afraid 
of her own emotions, her vulnerability. 
I’m sure she knows the empty relation-
ships my aunt left won’t be filled with 
new people, sharing wine at dinner par-

ties or on dirty couches. 
She needs something 
else that will fill the 
gap my aunt has left in 
her — a storyteller, a 
friend, the subject of 
jealousy and discipline.

My mind is consumed 

with the painting and 
contemplations. I think 
about the oil paint as it 
glistens under different 
lights in my apartment. 
I 
don’t 
know 
much 

about the anatomy of 
souls, but in those col-
ors, as they stack on 
one another, inside her 
pencil lines or deliber-
ately outside, I know 
mine and my aunt’s are 
similar.

***
I’ve been in the car 

for five hours. I bor-
rowed a GPS from my 
landlord 
because 
my 

car doesn’t have one 
built in. He charged me 
a couple of dollars for 
it, but I didn’t mind. My 
car is mostly empty. My 

backpack is in my trunk. I didn’t pack any 
clothes. The finished painting is in the pas-
senger seat.

When I finished it, when it sat flat on 

the floor of a concrete studio, when the 
boxes of bug carcasses rattled with in the 
light breeze, my apartment had never felt 
so silent and empty. I sat with the soul of a 
woman echoing off my floor. Her flesh and 
blood were buried that summer but what 
was left was there, flat and rectangular. I 
knew I had to share my resurrection with 
the one woman who needed to feel my aunt 
again.

I drive down the street I was raised on. 

I turn into the driveway of my childhood 
home, I come to a gentle stop. I watch my 
mother stir behind the curtains of the liv-
ing room. She’s not expecting me. I turn off 
the car. With the finished painting in one 
arm and an autumn of words on my lips, I 
approach the front door.

High Risk

creative non-fiction

E

dward meets me at the bus stop 
on campus with our standard 
greeting: smiling and clapping 
his hands slowly, letting out 

a whooping, “O-K, O-K.” He looks like he 
always has, wide-eyed and enthusiastic but 
stifling a perceptible weariness, in a hoodie, 
skinny jeans and white Vans.

One of my best friends from back home, 

Edward is a student at Cornell University. He 
is, in many ways, exactly like me. We listen to 
the same music, we are both obsessed with 
basketball — playing and following — and 
our sense of humor is eerily similar. In fact, 
I’ve slowly realized that my still-tight-knit 
group of friends from back home is made up 
of, more or less, different racial variations 
on the same person. Or maybe — and this is 
most definitely true — everyone feels that 
way about their first group of friends. Either 
way, when you have spent a month and a 
half overcome with work and pressure and 
a poisonous sense of dejected alienation, you 
must leave, in some ways, to reconnect with 
a different, Ivy League version of yourself.

It’s comforting to see him, even if it has 

only been less than two months since we 
last hung out. It’s Fall Break, and rather 
than spend more of my parents’ hard-
earned income on an insufficient trip back 
home to the Bay Area, I’ve decided to spend 
my own on a sabbatical to Ithaca, N.Y., the 
world’s most popular tourist destination. 
I initially figured it would be a standard 
visit, but Edward has notified me that, for 
some reason, we would be visiting a nearby 
casino in the process. After dropping off my 
baggage at his nearby apartment, we stop to 
grab lunch at a small sandwich place.

“So what’s the deal with this casino stuff?” 

I ask after we catch up on the necessary 
subjects.

“Yeah, that’s going to be sketch,” Edward 

laughs with a mouth full of Rueben. “It’s 
my boy’s 21st birthday, but we’re going to 
go to this random casino in the afternoon 
tomorrow.”

“Who goes to a casino for their 21st 

birthday? Isn’t that more of an 18th birthday 
thing?”

“I think he’s having something later that 

night with his main crew, but we’re just 
doing this with our friends.”

The main crew. I always found it odd that 

we demarcate our friends like this, as discrete 
groups occupying different hierarchies. 
It makes sense, I guess; commingling 
between social groups is an unfortunately 
uncomfortable experience. After a bit of 
silence, I ask Edward the question that, 
eventually, every guy asks their friend after 
a prolonged era of separation.

“How’s it going with the ladies?” I smile 

knowingly at him.

“Good one.” He lets out a big laugh, and 

then looks down at his sandwich. This is a 
running joke among our group of friends. 
We ask one another this same question, and 
we always laugh, providing some snarky 
answer. We all know it’s mostly a joke, but 
also, we all know that, buried somewhere, 
there is an aching, pulsing sadness at the 
heart of both the question and answer. 
As emotionally immature, college-aged 
men, we simply prefer to not address this 
explicitly.

For guys our age, the barometer of success 

in your reported life is often “how many girls 
you’ve hooked up with.” I deeply despise this, 
mostly in that “this is incredibly degrading 
to women” way — someone give me a medal 
for doing literally the least I possibly can for 
feminism — but also in that “why is this a 
thing?” sense.

***
On our way to this fabled casino, we stop 

to pick up three of Edward’s friends from 
their various fraternity houses. One by one, 
they pile into the back of the Honda CR-V 
Edward has borrowed: a long, lanky kid 
from New Jersey named Nishanth, who has 
an unfortunate tendency to talk about his 
finance major and “recruiting for consulting 
jobs”; a short guy in a “groutfit” named 
Chris; and the birthday man himself, a tall 
kid named John with a deep, lumbering 
voice. Off we go, this group of college kids 
in a CR-V, an hour and a half through rural, 
farm-country upstate New York toward 
Syracuse.

The casino itself is a curious entity. We 

pull into the parking lot of an incongruously 
modern building titled Turning Stone 
Resort Casino situated in the middle of a 
somewhat rural, antiquated community in 
central New York. It’s painted in a blinding 
white, and much of the exterior is made 
up of glass windows. The main building 
housing the casino reminds me of some kind 
of extravagant Dubai hotel, an insidious 
growth planted in the middle of a depressive 
economy and agricultural blight.

Inside, we are treated to the sights and 

sounds of your average gambling floor — or 
so I’m told. This might be as good a time 
as any to admit I’ve never actually been to 
a casino. I grew up in a Muslim household, 
went to Muslim Sunday school for 10 years 
and even went on the Muslim pilgrimage to 
Mecca during my junior year of high school. 
I like to say I’m more culturally religious 
than actually so — read: “not very” — but 
nonetheless, there were many opportunities 
I was denied as a child: dating, alcohol, pork 

products (bacon! I know!) and gambling. My 
family has been to Las Vegas, sure, but we 
visited that unknowable city armed with the 
same mentality with which Indian families 
visit Lake Tahoe — not to ski, of course, but 
to “see the lake!” I was never allowed to 
witness the casinos that lurked underneath 
the hotel rooms we stayed in; my sister and 
I were always ushered past them quickly, 
for absurd fear of our being whisked away 
by the seductive whispers of the devil. And 
so, the prestige and glamor of the Turning 
Stone Resort Casino in Verona, N.Y., is 
my first taste of the distinctly American 
phenomenon of gambling.

What lingers, however, both then and now, 

is the people. As one would expect in upstate 
New York, they are overwhelmingly white, 
and so there arrives the immediate, familiar 
and admittedly irrational discomfort that 
accompanies any racial minority. There are 
old ladies in the standard costume of light-
khaki capris; thick, ungainly tennis shoes; 
and oversized blue T-shirts; they slump 
over the chairs at the slot machines, their 
glasses lit up by the spinning numbers and 
cash signs, with plastic cups in hand. There 
are older men in “Members Only” jackets 
hunched over at the blackjack tables, and the 
dealers — of which there are noticeably more 
minorities — do their monotonous job with 
ruthless, robotic efficiency.

I begin to realize, though, that I, along 

with my compatriots, am probably financially 
better off than most of the patrons. I am a 
part of this cadre of liberal, ivory tower 
elitists, encroaching upon a world that is 
not mine, so who am I to preemptively judge 
its citizens? What gives me the right to look 
down upon them, to try to decipher, as I 
often cruelly do, who were the bigots I had 
been taught to expect and who were simply 
people whom the world had abandoned? I 
resolve to spend my four hours here with as 
open a mind as possible; understanding is 
nothing more than a bridge to be crossed, by 
two willing parties.

Chris decides he wants to stay at the 

blackjack tables and put those probability 
charts to good use, but the four of us, 
intimidated by the process, leave in search 
of the poker tables. Our search is initially 
fruitless, but in our travels around the 
floor, I am caught off-guard by the casually 
surreal rows and rows of slot machines, 
each one occupied by slight variations on the 
same old, white archetype I have now seen 
innumerable times.

“Dude, this is fucking creepy, man,” I 

whisper to Edward.

“What is?”
“Like, look at these people on the slot 

machines. Doesn’t this kind of freak you 
out?”

“Oh, yeah, that shit’s weird. Like they’re 

just in the zone.”

We turn to stare impolitely, just watching.
“Do you think they’re, like, gambling their 

life savings?” I ask.

“No way, man,” Edward replies. “How do 

you know they’re all, like, poor?”

“That’s true. Why do you think they do 

this then?”

Edward is silent for a bit, searching. “I 

don’t know, man. Probably just, like, they 
know all the people here and it becomes a 
thing.”

This kind of vague explanation is 

characteristic of friends that can’t even 
enumerate the sources of their own 
unhappiness. We don’t know why, exactly, 
people gamble, but we can make a guess. 
And what surprises me is that his estimation 
isn’t some kind of treatise on the adrenaline 
rush that one endures, or the tricky allure of 
taking money from other people — rather, 
it’s simply a nebulous portrait of some web of 
interconnectedness, an improperly defined 
community in which people find themselves 
in one another.

***
Of the few card games I know how to play, 

poker is by far the one I’m most enthusiastic 
about. A few summers ago, I experienced a 
harmless online poker phase, a year before 
my somewhat more socially damaging card 
trick phase. But the environment I am about 
to enter is completely new terrain: I have 
never had so much personal investment 
(money) in the games I’ve played. The 
thought of losing my $80 is, to me, wholly 
terrifying, and I realize this will be obvious 
to anyone playing against me. So instead, I 
compromise. I cash in $40 — a slightly less 
demoralizing amount — for chips, and ask 
the floor manager for an open spot.

The poker room is smaller than I expected. 

It’s decorated like an old-fashioned salon of 
sorts, with wood paneling lining the walls 
and tables and chairs. The carpet is par-for-
the-course hotel flooring, complete with 
the nonsensical loops and deep crimson 
shade. In one corner is a small bar, and in 
another is the cashier’s booth, where three 
tellers stand behind vertical bars like a 
prison, exchanging stacks of chips and cash 
underneath. The room isn’t full, but a few 
tables near the end are, populated by mostly 
silent men with headphones on.

As it is, there are four spots open, but 

they’re two to a table. We decide to split up 
— me and Edward, John and Nishanth — 
because each of us is too frightened to play 
a game alone. Edward and I take our measly

stacks of chips and sit down at the oval-
shaped table to which we are ushered. I peek 
in at a different game at the table behind me. 
There are eight people playing, a middle-
aged man leans over his backward chair as 
a woman — presumably a resort employee 
— massages his back. A young woman 
wearing a “MAKE AMERICA GREAT 
AGAIN” hat sits across the table. Holding 
a glass of wine in one hand, she’s prone to 
loudly commenting on peoples’ moves as the 
rest of the players stay silent; I notice she’s 
currently the table leader, with an enormous 
pile of chips at her disposal, and I begin to 
suspect this brashness might be a strategy of 
some kind.

Turning back to my table, I try to formulate 

my own game plan, but I’m reminded by the 
sobering reality of my small, $40 stack of 
red chips that a strategy is futile. I will be 
relentlessly bullied by the others, no matter 
what I try. As the dealer sets up the table, I 
survey the rest of the players. There’s an old 
man to my right and an old man to my left, 
both with headphones on. I would think this 
to be some form of cheating, but I notice it’s 
a common trend; many people around the 
room do the same, unnervingly silent and 
their hands covering their mouths as they 
watch the dealers. Edward sits across from 
me, and next to him is a young, well-built 
man in a military haircut. He has diamond 
stud earrings, and he wears the hood of his 
gray Nike sweatshirt over half of his head. 
Sitting beside him is another young guy in 
a gray hoodie, his hair in dreadlocks. He’s 
scrolling through his phone with one hand 
and flipping his formidable stack of chips 
in the other. Rounding out the table are 
older men, each one wearing earbuds and 
slyly sizing up the other players out of the 
corners of their eyes. It’s a dispiriting, but 
not unsurprising, fact that I have the least 
amount of chips at the table. I sigh as the 
dealer begins to deal.

For the first few rounds, I fold, pre-flop. 

It’s a horrible way to play, I know, but I am 
deathly afraid of putting my money on the 
line against complete strangers. I can hear 

my parents’ disappointed sobs as they cry 
somewhere in the metaphysical ether over 
the fact that their son has been lost to Satan. 
“But I haven’t even bet anything yet!” I cry 
back to them, but they don’t respond; the 
damage is done, and they begin to divert all 
the necessary funds toward my sister.

When I do finally receive a good hand, 

I cautiously throw out a bet: $15. It’s a bit 
high, but I have pocket jacks, and I’m feeling 
decent about this one. My heart is racing, 
nonetheless, as I see my own money in the 
pot, up for grabs and susceptible to the worst 
of fates. Unfortunately, the other players 
are not complete idiots, so they all fold, 
leaving the scraps of big and small blinds 
for me to embarrassingly slide into my pile. 
Still, I begin to understand the appeal — I’m 
indescribably happy, even at the smallest of 
returns, that I’ve actually won something. I 
am filled with cheap adrenaline, ready for the 
next hand immediately.

“No way I was going to play that, my 

man,” the guy with the crew cut says to me. 
I’m surprised, since no one has said much of 
anything up to this point.

I smile, unsure of how to respond. Edward 

looks at me, laughing silently. He’s the better 
poker player between the two of us, but so far, 
he’s employed the same strategy as I have.

“Man, Chris, you really don’t screw 

around, do you?” says the other man in the 
gray hoodie. He’s addressing the dealer, 
and it seems the sphere of conversation has 
opened.

Chris, whose nametag is quite small, is 

a balding man who looks to be in his late 
30s. He’s seen it all before, I can guess, and 
players chirping at him are nothing new. 
Ever unflappable, he smiles and mutters, “If 
you don’t mess with me, I don’t mess with 
you.”

The man laughs and tosses him a chip, 

for which Chris thanks him and promptly 
slides into his secured tip repository 
underneath the table. Theirs is now a joking 
and playful relationship, and the game 
continues.

“Man, I’m not even supposed to be here,” 

Crew Cut sighs a couple of hands later. 
He sounds somewhat remorseful, but he 
remains at the table. The other players, with 
their earbuds still firmly jammed into their 
ears, look at him but don’t say anything. 
“My boy OD’d on some shit yesterday and 
his funeral’s tonight.”

Edward and I shoot each other confused 

looks as conspicuously as possible, but no 
one else at the table seems to register the 
shock value of what he’s just said.

The man with the dreadlocks responds: 

“Oh, yeah? What’s up?”

“Yeah, heroin or some shit. And he was, 

like, my cousin, too.”

“I feel, man.”
At this point, I completely forget about 

the game. This is fascinating, riveting, and 
I am enthralled, in the way that a museum 
patron gawks at a particularly interesting 
painting. I had never heard something so 
shocking be delivered so casually. Needless 
to say, I fold for a few hands.

“You smoke weed, Chris?” Dreadlocks 

has returned to his affable banter with the 
dealer. Chris smiles but doesn’t respond.

“How about we smoke a blunt after this? 

You gotta smoke weed, Chris. When I got 
shot in the arm, who was there for me? 
When my mom kicked me out of the house, 
who was there for me? Mary Jane’s been 
the only girl I’ve ever loved, man.”

Crew 
Cut 
laughs, 
nods 
and 

enthusiastically gives him a knowing 
handshake. A cynical thought creeps into 
my head: This all sounds so outlandish, 
so implausible, so what if it’s some sort 
of genius strategy? I haven’t even paid 
attention to the last few hands. Perhaps I’m 
being played.

But I can’t deny the genuine rapport 

that’s been building between the two of 
them, even between Dreadlocks and the 
dealer. I smile at Edward, one of my oldest 
friends, and shake my head at the absurdity 
of it all.

A few rounds later, I’m dealt pocket kings. 

Thrilled and overconfident, I place larger 
and larger bets, until the only two players 
left before the river — the final community 
card — are me and the man sitting to my 
right. I don’t have much betting power 
left, so I go all in with reckless abandon. 
Based on the cards on the table, this guy 
probably doesn’t have much better than 
pocket kings.

He has pocket aces. I lose $40, and I 

leave the table. In one fell swoop, I am now 
dejected and in possession of a slightly 
smaller net worth. The world, once again, 
is cruel.

I learn that Nishanth has accrued an 

absurd amount of chips. I walk over to 
their table and happen to come upon a hand 
in which he goes all in. It’s him against a 
man sitting at the end of the table. He’s 
talking a bit of trash, but nothing big. The 
dealer asks them to show their hands, and 
Nishanth wins — and wins big. I notice a 
flash of sadness in the other man’s eyes 
before he continues laughing and jawing 
at him. Nishanth, now sufficiently well-
stocked, decides to cash his chips — $340 

worth — and leave.

As we make our way out of the poker 

room, I look back at my old table. 
Dreadlocks gets up to go to the bar, but 
not before asking Crew Cut, “What’s your 
drink?”

“Bud Light,” he responds.
***
As I lie to sleep that night, on a futon that 

is indescribably uncomfortable, I should 
be angry about my loss, but all I can think 
of is the two men from our table. I’m still 
amazed by the confessions they spouted, 
but I’m even more impressed by the quick 
friendship that was so easily formed. The 
two of them have, very likely, endured 
tragedies of which I would never know, 
but simply the enunciation of these was 
enough to initiate a relationship formed 
across the table of a casino.

It is not, I surmise, the thrill of gambling 

that drives people to casinos, but rather, as 
Edward hypothesized, it may be nothing 
more than a chance at belonging. The same 
hope that drives me to wander into coffee 
shops unprovoked, the desperate pull of the 
unknown, buried relationships that we may 
never excavate — this may be the identical 
motivation that leads them to spend their 
Saturday afternoons risking their money 
in statistically futile fashion. We are 
nothing more than creatures that yearn for 
a sense of community. Yet there is no true 
happiness without the chance of sadness, 
no true satisfaction without the possibility 
of emptiness; these states of being are 
defined by what they are inherently not. 
Human relationships are not rich if they 
are not colored by the shadow of loneliness.

I realize, then, that I have been massively 

hypocritical. For the duration of my 
afternoon, I simply projected my own 
presuppositions onto the people I saw, as 
if they were characters I could manipulate 
and bend to my own condescending will. 
I took no time to speak to them, to reach 
out into the void of human existence and 
offer my own hand. This is my burden: this 
inability to connect. The blank stares into 
slot machine screens, the silent murmurs in 
the Bingo Room, the easy back-and-forth in 
between folds and calls and raises — what’s 
the difference? What are they searching for 
that I am not?

There is so much uncertainty involved 

in reaching out. I am but one of millions 
of people out there like me: perpetually 
alone and constantly complaining about it. 
But while the reasons for complacency are 
innumerable — fear of rejection, low self-
esteem, etc. — aren’t they all subservient to 
this one ideal of connection? An ideal that, in 
practice, is infinitely harder for people who 
are symptomatically predisposed to avoid 
it. We crave it, though. We yearn for what 
we can’t do, what it seems everyone else 
can. The casino, then, is not some abstract 
environment through which I aim to focus 
my true critical interests — it’s a place where 
the dreams of one man brush up against the 
hopes of another. It’s a place of futures bet 
and chances lost. It’s a place of, for better or 
worse, communal risk.

A mural adds a pop of color to an otherwise dark alley. 

This weekend I walked around Ann Arbor with an umbrella in one hand 

and a tripod in the other, desperately trying to shield my camera from the 

torrent of rain. I had always wanted to capture long exposure shots and 

thought this was the perfect time to try it out. As I walked through familiar 
streets, I realized that, though I’d been skimming the scenery every day, I 
never actually looked closely at it. This little excursion showed me there is 

always a new perspective to even a seemingly mundane little city.
