when she attended the Michigan

College 
Summer 

Research Fellowship as a fellow in 
2017, inspiring her to transfer to the

LSA freshman Lucas Cole is 

more invested in school than 
the average freshman — not just 
when it comes to his classes in 
the University of Michigan’s 
Residential College, but all of Ann 
Arbor’s public schools. Shortly 
after graduating from Skyline 
High School last spring, Cole 
launched a campaign for the Ann 
Arbor School Board of Trustees.

He said his experience as a 

former student informed his 
perspective as a candidate.

“I think that if you talk to 

students in the district, from 
what I’ve experienced, students 
really know that they don’t have a 
voice, that people don’t really care 
what they think and they’re upset 
by it,” Cole said.

Bernie Sanders rallies for Whitmer

ANNIE KLUS AND MAX KUANG/Daily

Michigan Gubernatorial candidate Gretchen Whitmer, Senator Bernie Sanders, D-Vermont, and Whitmer running mate Garlin Gilchrist speak at a rally for Gretchen Whitmer in Rackham 
Auditorium Friday evening. 

CITY

With less than three weeks until midterm elections, over 1,000 students attend rally for Democrats

With less than three weeks until 

midterm elections, Democratic 
gubernatorial candidate Gretchen 
Whitmer is teaming up with 
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders to 
garner support. 

University 
of 
Michigan’s 

chapter of College Democrats 
hosted a rally Friday evening in 
support of Whitmer in Rackham 
Auditorium. Over 1,100 students, 
faculty members and Michigan 
residents 
filled 
the 
main 

auditorium and an overflow room 
on the fourth floor.

In addition to Sanders and 

Whitmer, the event featured U.S. 
Rep. Debbie Dingell, U.S. Sen. 
Gary Peters and Garlin Gilchrist, 
Whitmer’s 
running 
mate 
for 

lieutenant governor, and various 
candidates for state and local 
office.

Public Policy senior Kellie 

Lounds, chair for the College 
Democrats, spoke on Whitmer’s 

strengths in regard to mobilizing 
young people, noting the impact 
an endorsement from Sanders has 
made on her platform.

“College students here love her 

because they know she’s going to 
fight for them, but there are also 
more moderate people that love 
her because they know she’s going 
to lead a strong government that’s 

transparent, effective and useful,” 
Lounds said.

In light of historically low 

turnout rates among University 
students 
in 
recent 
elections, 

Lounds said building momentum 
is more important now. According 
to the Ford School of Public Policy, 
about 14 percent of University

The 
Michigan 
Daily 

Administration 
Beat 
will 
be 

conducting 
interviews 
with 

the incumbent and challenging 
candidates 
for 
University 
of 

Michigan Board of Regents prior to 
the November midterm election. Our 
first interview is with Democratic 
challenger 
candidate 
Jordan 

Acker. Acker is a University alum 
and worked for the Barack Obama 
administration 
in 
Washington, 

D.C. He currently works at a law 

firm with his father and resides in 
Oakland County with his wife and 
two daughters.

The Michigan Daily: What made 

you decide to run for regent this year?

Jordan Acker: There’s two real 

days in my life that made me want 
to do this. The first one was where 
I graduated from undergrad … My 
parents signed me up for a bunch 
of (College Savings Programs) that 
allowed me to graduate free … 

The University of Michigan 

Weiser Center for Emerging 
Democracies 
hosted 
Anna 

Grzymala-Busse, 
a 
political 

science professor at Stanford 
University, 
Friday 
afternoon 

for a lecture about the modern 
challenges to democracy. More 
than 50 students and faculty 
attended 
the 
event, 
titled 

“Populism and the Erosion of 
Democracy,” and were able to 
engage in an active discussion 
concerning the implications of a 
recent surge in populist support.

Busse, 
who 
is 
currently 

researching 
the 
surge 
in 

support for populism in former 
Communist countries, aimed to 
define the populist ideology and 
explain why it is on the rise in 
Eastern Europe. She also detailed 
how populism has contributed to 
the deterioration of democratic 
institutions worldwide.

“All 
populist 
parties 
and 

movements basically make two 
claims,” she said. “The first claim 
is that the elites are a corrupt and 
self-serving cartel. So business 
elites, political elites, whether 
politicians or businessmen or 
journalists, they’re all in it for 
themselves.”

According 
to 
Busse, 
this 

political stance has resulted in 
increasing distrust of liberal 
democratic institutions and a 

push to minimize their power.

“The first target are the 

courts,” Busse stated. “What 
they do, basically, is to politicize 
the courts and reduce judicial 
autonomy, as that could be 
a major constraint on these 
parties.”

Busse 
also 
cited 
recent 

populist policies of court packing, 
judicial age limits, changes to 
legal framework and, in some 
cases, 
large-scale 
revisions 

of national constitutions. In 
Hungary, she stated, one party 
member was put in charge of all 
national judicial appointments, 
all but eliminating the presence 
of checks on party power.

In her explanation of this 

threat 
to 
democracy, 
Busse 

mainly cited the examples from 
Poland and Hungary, nations 
where the populist PiS and Fidesz 
parties gained supermajorities in 
their national congresses, giving 
them 
unchecked 
legislative 

power.

“In both of these cases, 

they are going to be governing 
unconstrained by any coalition 
partner, or frankly any forms of 
checks and balances,” she said.

As Busse’s research proved, 

recent surges in populist support 
have been largely linked to 
economic downturn and the 
failure of mainstream parties to 
respond appropriately to public 
concerns.

“These mainstream parties 

have 
increasingly 
failed 
to 

absorb and to respond to popular 
fears,” Busse explained. “Fears 
about 
the 
economy, 
about 

immigration, about what’s going 
on in the world and how rapidly 
it’s changing. Instead, what 
they followed was basically a 
mainstream policy consensus.”

LSA sophomore Yuting Chen 

is studying political science and 
expressed curiosity at the end 
of the lecture with the points 
brought up both by Busse and 
members of the audience.

students participated in the 
2014 midterms. Initiatives like 
the Big 10 Voting Challenge and 
Turn Up Turnout have aimed to 
mitigate voter turnout gaps in 

hopes that more students will 
vote in the upcoming election.

“I was a little worried after 

the Kavanaugh hearings that 
enthusiasm was going to die 
out,” Lounds said. “So I’m 
hoping this (event) will hype 
people up, get everybody ready 
and make these last 18 days 

of (Get Out the Vote) and the 
last 18 days before the election 
count.”

The Whitmer rally began 

with brief remarks from state 
Rep. Yousef Rabhi and state 
Sen. Rebekah Warren, as well 
as candidates for the Board of 
Regents Jordan Acker and Paul 

Brown. Acker stressed the 
importance 
of 
electing 

progressive 
Democrats 

like Brown and himself to 
the board.

“We have never had a 

regent at this University 
that has had student debt 
before; we have never had 
a regent that graduated 
from college this century 
on 
the 
board,” 
Acker 

said. “We can do so much 
better.”

Dana Nessel and Jocelyn 

Benson, 
Democratic 

nominees 
for 
attorney 

general and secretary of 
state respectively, each 
received standing ovations 
during 
their 
speeches 

Friday night.

“The Republicans are 

scared of me … they’re 
labeling me ‘Dangerous 
Dana,’” Nessel said. “I am 
going to be dangerous to 
the Trump administration. 
I will be dangerous to 
anybody who infringes 
upon the rights and the 
civil liberties of the people 
who live here in the state 

of Michigan.”

The 
event 
attracted 

Michigan 
Democrats 
from 

across the state, but they were 
also met with protest from the 
University’s chapter of College 
Republicans who stood close to 
the line of hopeful attendees, 
along 
with 
members 
from 

Americans for Prosperity, a 
conservative 
organization 

known for its ads attacking 
Whitmer.

LSA junior Austin McIntosh, 

communications chair for the 
College Republicans, said the 
group was protesting in support 
for free speech, regardless of 
ideology or political party.

“In my opinion, what we’re 

trying to do is let people know 
that there are other opinions 
out there, whether it be from 
the right or the left,” McIntosh 
said. “All we’re trying to do on 
campus is promote freedom of 
speech.”

Dingell was next to take 

the stage, where she spoke on 
immigration reform and equal 
rights for women.

“We cannot let (Republicans) 

win, and democracy is under 
attack,” Dingell said. “We need 
everybody across the state to roll 
up their sleeves, to volunteer … 
let’s take America back to where 
it’s supposed to be.”

GL A SS PUMPKIN FEST

Arnold Schwarzenegger, the 

former actor and California 
governor, spoke Friday at a rally 
held in East Lansing to voice 
his support for Proposal 2 and 
thegroup Voters Not Politicians. 
The 
advocacy 
coalition 

endorses the creation of a 
nonpartisan commission that 
would redraw district lines.

Proposal 2 will appear on 

the Nov. 6 Michigan midterm 
ballot. If the proposal passes, 
the Secretary of State will 

oversee the selection of 13 
commission members — four 
Republicans, four Democrats, 
and five independents or third-
party affiliated.

Schwarzenegger 
said 
the 

issue of gerrymandering needs 
to be fixed, commending the 
work of Katie Fahey, founder of 
Voters Not Politicians.

“It’s easy to complain, but 

then to go up and say, ‘I’m going 
to do something about it’ — that’s 
what she did,” Schwarzenegger 

said. “I’m so proud that all of 
you are here today.”

California is the only state 

to have a similar system to 
the one Proposal 2 would 
create if passed. As governor, 
Schwarzenegger 
backed 
the 

California 
Citizens 

Redistricting 
Commission, 

which was passed in November 
2008.

Schwarzenegger 
has 
also 

supported efforts in updating 
the redistricting process in 

Missouri, Colorado and Utah.

Actress Jennifer Lawrence 

has also been an outspoken 
advocate 
for 
Proposal 
2. 

Represent 
Michigan, 
the 

state’s chapter of the national 
group RepresentUs, released 
a 
video 
with 
Lawrence 

endorsing the proposal this 
week.

While addressing the crowd 

at the rally, Schwarzenegger 
encouraged 
the 
state 
to 

“terminate gerrymandering.”

I am a dancer.
I worry what you hear when I 

say that is I like dancing. Which to 
be fair, I do. I love going to Brown 
parties and busting out all the 
latest Bollywood moves, or trying 
to see if my muscles remember 
the motions from long ago ballet 
classes, or trying and failing to 
imitate those cool K-Pop routines.

But that’s not what I said.
I said, I am a dancer.
Specifically, I am an Indian 

classical dancer trained in the 
North Indian style known as 
Kathak. It’s a beautiful form that 
originally was a temple dance 
before getting bastardized as 
a whore’s dance by the British, 
before getting bastardized again 
by 
Bollywood 
before 
being 

reclaimed once more in recent 
years.

It’s a part of my culture, but it 

feels like, just with every beautiful 
aspect of my heritage that I so 
cherish, it gets warped.

Like the other day, when my 

Dada (paternal grandfather) and I 
spoke. For those of you who don’t 
know, one of the most important 
religious texts for the average 

Hindu is the Bhagavad Gita, and 
not once does it say anything to 
the effect of “man shall not lie 
with man” or some other bullshit 
nonsense like that. So why was 
there such a toxic backlash toward 
the LGBT community? The repeal 
is too recent to have changed 
the 
national 
culture 
toward 

queerness.

That shouldn’t be my culture, 

because that’s not what my 
religion preaches, but somehow 
that’s a part of my culture now.

My religion teaches us the 

power of women: these angry, 
glorious 
women 
who 
killed 

demons, brought their husbands 
back from the grips of the lord of 
the dead, stayed strong in the face 
of terror, and represent knowledge 
and wealth. Somehow, it’s been 
twisted into this belief that girls 
are burdens. The same people 
who say a daughter-in-law is a 
form of Lakshmi, the goddess of 
wealth, taking human form also 
bemoans the fact that they have a 
daughter in the first place. (These 
are the same people who ignore 
daughters-in-law used to come 
with dowries because daughters 
were sold into marriage).

It’s hypocritical and I hate it.
The deities who are depicted 

in caves and ancient art as dark 

skinned. The deities became blue 
skinned when Victorian artists 
decided it was more aesthetically 
pleasing. Yet also, Bollywood 
only rewards light skin and every 
aspect of media shows fair and 
lovely is better than any kind of 
melanin.

It makes it so hard to love 

myself, including my heritage.

There’s this distance between 

my culture and my religion and 
I can’t understand how these 
discrepancies formed. It can’t only 
be the last stubborn remnants of 
colonization, can it?

I feel like I constantly have to 

twist myself to defend a religion 
I don’t practice very faithfully in 
order to feel somewhat proud of 
the culture I am so grateful to have 
inherited. I have to weave through 
the bits and pieces I believe are 
wrong to settle into what feels 
right.

When it comes to my identity, 

I’m always dancing around the 
labels and categories that come 
with my heritage to put together 
something that bridges the gap 
between what I’m taught and what 
I see. I don’t stop performing when 
I’m off the stage, because I can’t.

I am a dancer.
And sometimes, it feels like 

that’s all I’ll ever be.

Twisting meaning: my religion

AKANKSHA SAHAY

MiC Blogger

COURTESY OF THE AUTHOR

The thing about being the only 

woman of color in the room is 
that sometimes I forget that this 
is not how it has to be.

If I am just hanging out 

with my friends, sitting with 
the fellow interns or meeting 
with my superiors at work, it 
is easy to forget about race and 
diversity demographics. In the 
same way that you might forget 
about a distinctive feature on a 
friend (like brightly dyed hair) 
or in the way that I don’t notice 
my mother’s Chinese accent, 
familiarity with the individual 
has a way of making us forget 
our differences and see through 
to the person.

That’s not to say I forget who 

I am. I value my heritage greatly. 
My sisters and I will often 
remark that we are thankful 
that we are not fully white (as 
mixed-race people are often just 
identified with their non-white 
part). But as a biracial person, I 
can also often pass as white or at 
least be seen as a stereotypically 
non-threatening 
minority, 

and this may contribute to my 
ability to not constantly think 
about my race and feel relatively 
comfortable in spaces without 
much diversity.

But the thing about being the 

only women of color in most 
rooms is that it can become so 
normal — until you realize it is 
not.

My office (which is otherwise 

wonderfully 
welcoming 
and 

amazing) has only a handful of 
people of color working here — 
two of which are interns. When 
I am sitting with my bosses (two 
white men) or with the other 
interns, I sometimes forget that 
I am the only woman of color 
voice in that room. I don’t feel 
uncomfortable or like an outsider 
— I am just a team member.

But there are other times 

when I sit in our large conference 

room in a meeting with half the 
staff, and staring at me from the 
other side of the table are dozens 
of blue eyes with blonde hair 
and the room starts to feel warm 
and almost suffocating in its 
whiteness. Instead of focusing 
on the presentation at hand, I 
can’t help but count the people 
of color in the office and in the 
room, wondering if they are 
thinking the same thing I am.

These 
feelings 
manifest 

themselves in different ways, 
too. 
One 
night 
I 
had 
the 

opportunity to hear from a panel 
of former Barack Obama White 
House staff members who were 
all women of color, and it was 
uplifting to see people from 
such diverse backgrounds have 
a major influence on policy. 
The audience was also filled 
with more women of color, and 
I felt overwhelmingly at peace 
yet also excited to see so many 
young professional women of 
color succeeding in Washington, 
D.C., where too often we are 
surrounded by white men.

Another night, in a very 

different context, I was drunk 
at a bar and met an Asian man 
who had recently moved to the 
U.S. He talked about how he was 
having a difficult time finding 
community here. Overflowed 
with emotion, I hugged him and 

sobbed uncontrollably for the 
next hour. It struck me then that 
I also had not found an Asian 
community here, and I could 
only imagine how much more 
difficult it was for him as an 
immigrant who was new to the 
city and country. The encounter 
reminded me how much I value 
my family and community at 
home and how much I missed 
that bond.

So, when I say I forget about 

being a woman of color when 
surrounded by white people, 
it’s not that I forget that I am, 
in fact, a woman of color. It’s 
that I almost suppress those 
emotions and forget how much I 
value those connections in order 
to find new ways to bond with 
white people to succeed in the in 
the world they rule.

I’ve learned about sports that 

I don’t care about so that I can 
chat with my boss about the 
latest college football updates 
after the weekend. I hold my 
tongue when my superiors talk 
about China and policy and 
marketing projects there because 
it is not my place to criticize their 
strategy as the intern (even if I 
lived there and have family there 
and understand the culture way 
better than they ever could). I 
pretend it is normal to be the 
only person of color in the room.

It can seem like everyone 

with any power is a white man 
in places like D.C. or in the 
corporate 
world 
sometimes. 

That every room you enter you 
will be the only person of color. 
But at other times there will be 
glimmers of hope when you hear 
from successful people of color 
who build each other and their 
communities up with them. Or 
when you attend an event aimed 
at your community and you 
finally feel at home.

It is sometimes easier to forget 

when you are the only woman of

Being the only WOC in the room

LYDIA MURRAY

MiC Columnist

When I first read “The Hate 

U Give,” I remember feeling 
emotional. 
More 
than 
just 

understanding the very core of 
what was being discussed and the 
politics around Black activism, 
I was the main character, Starr 
Carter: attending a private white 
school and doing her very best 
to never give anyone a reason to 
call her “ghetto,” playing by the 
rules, but going home and finally 
taking off that facade she put on 
when she went to school. Though 
I didn’t grow up in a neighborhood 
like Garden Heights, there are 
undeniable parallels between Starr 
and me that I have never seen 
represented in a book, movie or TV 
show before. For the first time, it 
felt like a part of my life that I was 
so timid to speak about was being 
shown to the world because it was 
more than just my experience. It 
was the experience of thousands of 
other Black girls who were put into 
private schools by their parents 
who wanted the world for their 
babies, sacrificing anything to send 
them to a good school.

Add in that her childhood best 

friend, Khalil, reminds me of my 
childhood “brother” who still 
mocks me for hanging around 
“white kids who don’t know what 
real music is” and laughs at my lack 
of knowledge of remixes he plays 
when he has the aux cord in the car. 
The trio of my sister our best friend 
— who always seemed to get us in 
trouble – and me: We were Khalil, 
Natasha and Starr.

I just wish that losing someone 

close to us at the hand of a gun 
wasn’t 
something 
that 
Starr 

and I didn’t have to share, but 
nonetheless, we do.

Sprinkling in the ignorance of 

her “friends” who could care less 
about the blatant mistreatment 
of the Black community around 
them because “it doesn’t matter” 
is also something that I had 
the misfortune of dealing with 
through my years in high school. 
Starr’s character was the closest 
I had ever come to seeing my life 

become a part of a conversation 
bigger than myself and I felt so 
incredibly proud to be able to have 
read something so moving and 
inspiring.

But, imagine my surprise when 

I found out Amandla Stenberg was 
going to play Starr in the movie. 
You’re probably confused as to 
why, so here’s a visual presentation:

This is the original cover of 

Starr, dark-skinned and rocking 
her type-4 fro.

Here’s what Amandla taking the 

role of Starr looks like: 

See the difference?
The thing that stuck out to me 

most was her skin color. Starr in the 
book is darker, as she is described 
as being “a medium brown” shade. 
Apparently, it was a decision by 
Fox Studios to make Starr into 
someone the shade of Stenberg, 
who is much lighter skinned than 
Starr’s original character. Besides 
Stenberg being the “go-to” Black 
girl for the rise of many diverse 
films, her politics are startling to 
me.

A point of contention right now 

is role representation and what it 
means for individual actors and 
actresses to demonstrate their 
solidarity against colorism and 
focusing on representation in 
Hollywood. Stenberg, known for 
her many roles in blockbuster hits, 
could have easily turned down this 
role like her counterpart Zendaya, 
who has been rejecting roles that 
darker-skinned 
women 
could 

only dream of because she knows 
Hollywood will never budge on 
casting talented Black women 
otherwise. But, she took the easy 
route and played the role in a movie 
that was destined to propel her 
career. Can I blame her for wanting 
to succeed in a white world? No. 
But I can blame her for taking 
this role from someone with less 
exposure than her to accurately 
portray the girl I saw when I first 
opened the book.

And don’t me get started on 

Starr’s original white boyfriend 
being played by Kian Lawley, who, 
after filming the movie, was found 
yelling the n-word in a hidden 
YouTube video and promptly 
kicked off the project. I don’t have 
the energy to give to racist white 

boys.

Despite the controversy, the 

content of the movie is what 
actually matters.

*Spoilers ahead*
Everyone knows that movie 

adaptations can be, well, terrible. 
However, the cast fit the characters 
perfectly from the books and 
even gave the spotlight to some 
undiscovered Black actresses and 
actors, which is something that 
movies like this should aim to do 
when discussing topics that affect 
an entire community of people.

I cried. I didn’t expect to; in fact, 

I felt like I was going to dislike the 
way the plot and characters didn’t 
seem natural. Instead, I found 
myself immersed in a world that 
had mirrored my own for so many 
years of my life that I almost felt 
violated. To me, the movie focused 
on the important parts of the Black 
experience as it did in the novel.

The collision of worlds that were 

compartmentalized within Starr’s 
mind falling apart in front of her 
eyes as she held on so desperately 
was heart-wrenching. Just like 
in our eyes, when something that 
we worked indescribably hard 
to uphold unravels, picking up 
the broken pieces to repair them 
is our first instinct. However, in 
realizing something of value to our 
character has fallen apart, there 
is an acknowledgment that part 
of ourselves never being the same 
again.

Starr realizes to move forward 

with the events in her life, tshe 
has to push aside her feelings 
of guilt that have followed her 
since childhood. Shedding the 
unsureness and utter fear she 
encounters as she speaks about the 
gang violence, police brutality and 
hatred she and those she has loved 
faced their entire lives.

As Tupac once said, “The 

Hate U Give Little Infants Fucks 
Everyone.” It was more than 
violence that killed Khalil, it 
was the very pain that had been 
passed down from generations of 
degradation and hatred. 

Relating to “The Hate U Give”

LORNA BROWN
Senior MiC Editor

In Arabic class this week, 

our 
infamous 
textbook 

AlKitaab transitioned from one 
controversial and politicized topic 
to the next, the new lesson being 
about violent Arab revolutions 
and governments as opposed to 
the previous lesson on marriage 
traditions. 
One 
advantage 
of 

this stark shift in topics is that a 
lot of the content material was 
reminiscent of the 2011 Egyptian 
revolution, and discussions of the 
chants used by protesters made 
me think of the music that arose 
as part of the movement. Despite 
not living in Egypt when the 
revolution broke out, this music 
connected me to my country, 
taking a distant cause and making 
it accessible to everyone.

“Yalmidan” 
(Oh 
Square) 
- 

Cairokee ft. Aida El-Ayoubi

“Oh Square, where were you 

long ago?”

This ode to Tahrir Square, 

where the protesters gathered in 
Cairo, captures the spirit of the 
revolution more than just about 
any other song in my opinion. The 
singers attribute their success to 
the Square, personifying it with all 
of the vigor and emotion behind the 
revolution. They tell it, “You have 
turned on the lights and collected 
around you a broken people. We 
are born anew,” crediting the 
Square with unifying the Egyptian 
masses and their struggles. What 
really stands out to me about 
this song is the fact that it isn’t 
looking at the revolution through 
rose-colored glasses. “Yalmidan” 
invokes the reality of life in pre-
revolution Egypt, helping listeners 
understand 
the 
long-lasting 

desperation and essential nature 
of finally speaking out against the 
regime and the hope they gained 
as a result. They describe how 
“The sound of freedom gathers 
us, our lives now have meaning. 
There’s no going back, our voice 
is now heard, and to dream is no 
longer forbidden.” Additionally, 
the anxiety of where the revolution 
would take them and whether the 
momentum would pay off is not 
forgotten as Aida El-Ayoubi sings, 
“Sometimes I’m scared we will 

become a memory, we move away 
(from you) and the idea dies,” but 
she later reaffirms her faith in the 
movement, reassuring listeners 
that “Our idea is our strength.”

“We will protect our country, as 

will the children of our children, 
and we’ll restore the rights of the 
youth who died for it”

“Sout el Horeya” (The Sound of 

Freedom) - Cairokee 

“I came down and said I’m not 

coming back

And I wrote with my blood in 

every street

We made ourselves heard by 

those who weren’t listening

And all the barriers were 

broken”

To me, this song always evokes 

an image of the whole country 
holding their heads up in the face of 
injustice and poverty, and working 
toward a common goal. This image 
is translated beautifully into the 
music video of different protesters 
singing the lyrics in the sea of 
demonstrators. 
One 
particular 

lyric calling out the regime’s 
selfishness by telling those in 
charge to stop using the word “I” 
embodies the community and 
connectivity of the protesters who 
were truly fighting for something 
bigger than themselves.

“In every street in my country
The sound of freedom is calling” 
“Hor” (Free) - Black Theama
This song, while not explicitly 

referencing the revolution, is 
essentially a list compiled by my 
absolute favorite Egyptian band, 
Black Theama, of simple things 
they consider part of becoming 
free. While these things included 
being free to style their own 
clothes or choose what time they 
sleep, they also touched on more 
complex freedoms that we may 
take for granted, like being free to 
dream, pick their religion or love 
their country. They also mention 
freedom to live their childhood 
and hate their government, both 
rights that were robbed from 
them as conditions didn’t permit 
some kids to just be kids without 
the weight of the world on their 
shoulders, and criticizing this 
corruption was punishable by 
imprisonment. They explain the 
need to fight for these freedoms 
and not stand idly by while the 
government profits off of their 
impoverishment, saying clearly 

“I like to live a peaceful life, but if 
you force me to be violent, I will 
be violent because I’m free.” It is 
also important that they describe 
their desire to be peaceful but 
being forced to action as I think 
media tends to portray violence 
as the first resort for Arabs as 
opposed to a final one. Perhaps 
the main point Black Theama is 
trying to make is that freedom 
means not only being afforded the 
opportunity to make decisions, but 
also being given a platform to say 
what’s on their mind. This desire 
for independence and to be heard 
is best articulated when they say, 
“I won’t be part of a machine, I 
won’t be a human extra. On my 
own I want to be important, and 
important means I’m free.”

“Ezzay” (How?) - Mohamed 

Mounir 

This song, also by a personal 

favorite, 
Mohamed 
Mounir, 

quickly became an anthem for 
the revolution. In it, Mounir asks 
Egypt, “How come I raise your 
head up high, but you push my head 
down, how come?” He goes on to 
describe how he is Egypt’s oldest 
street and biggest hope, pleading 
with 
the 
country, 
imploring 

why he was left vulnerable and 
abandoned when all he has ever 
done was hope for the country’s 
prosperity. This song explains 
the injustice brought about by a 
corrupt regime to the people who 
have lived their whole lives loving 
and working for the same country 
that is bringing them down.

“Irhal” (Leave) - Ramy Essam
One of the most powerful 

and unifying aspects of the 
revolution 
were 
the 
chants 

used by the protesters to call for 
Hosni Mubarak to step down. 
These chants were colloquial 
and accessible to the masses, 
making it all the more powerful 
as thousands of protesters united 
in shouts of defiance and anger 
against the regime. Aiding in this 
accessibility was Ramy Essam’s 
song “Irhal,” collecting many of 
the chants into one combined song 
that he often performed in Tahrir 
Square during the revolution. 
The chants used in this song are 
translated and listed below.

S

ome things are out of our control, 
like gas prices and traffic. You 
can’t control what others do or 
say, just like you can’t pick 
who’s in your family. Unfortunately, 
most of us assume we cannot control 
climate change.
Eyebrows have furrowed and 
anxiety levels have risen since the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change released a report earlier this 
month, outlining the treacherous path 
Earth is taking toward increased 
temperatures. Scientists now believe 
the point of no return is when 
our climate changes by 1.5 
degrees Celsius, not 2.0 degrees 
Celsius as previously thought. 
If we don’t “act dramatically” 
to reduce the carbon dioxide 
levels in our atmosphere, global 
temperatures 
may 
become 
irreversible in as soon as 12 
years. Time is running short; 
realistically, how can one of us 
in a sea of 7.6 billion earthlings 
keep the planet from getting 
warmer? We do it one person at 
a time.
Experts offer their opinions 
on whether we should consume 
less or consume smarter. At 
the Society of Environmental 
Journalists conference in Flint, 
Mich., this month, recognized 
experts gathered to discuss how 
to mitigate climate change and 
literally “Cutting the Crap”. Is 
reducing waste or recycling the 
key to cleaning up the world?
We need to truly “figure out 
how to recycle” and keep those 
plastic molecules in play, said 
Tony Kingsbury, founder and 
president of TKingsbury LLC, 
an international sustainability 
and plastics consulting firm 
said at the panel. “The problem 
is that waste is managed at a 
local level, on a city-by-city 
basis,” 
Kingsbury 
explained, 
denouncing 
the 
lack 
of 
standardized recycling policies 
from Ann Arbor to Detroit. 
Further, the material recovery 
facilities we have today were 
predominantly built to handle 
paper and not the plastics we 
consume at astronomical levels. 
“We set up the collection for 
paper… and don’t have the 
infrastructure 
for 
plastics,” 
Kingsbury said. In other words, 
to slow global warming, we 
need to rethink consumption by 
introducing fewer plastics into 
the world, and studying how to 
reuse the “crap” we already have.
On the other hand, Annie 
Leonard, the executive director 
of Greenpeace USA, argued we 
need to target the factories and 
eliminate environmental evils at 
the source. Plastic is practically 
a euphemism for fossil fuel, she 

said, and if we focus all of our 
energy on recycling, dangerous 
toxins will still contaminate 
our environment. The process 
of consumption starts with the 
earth and move from factories to 
homes to landfills, at which point 
it’s too late. As a country, she 
argued, we need to design waste 
out of the system and change 
the demand for products such as 
petroleum, coal and natural gas. 
Recycling can’t keep up with our 
plastic intake where the EPA says 
34.5 million tons were generated 
in 
2015 
alone. 
Instead 
of 
sweeping the problem under the 
rug (to China), Leonard suggests 
we remodel our economic base 
without utilizing fossil fuels; 
fighting fossil fuel extraction 
would stop the expansion of 
single use plastics.
“Only 10 percent of plastics 
get recycled,” Leonard pointed 
out, shining a light on the 
real 
outcomes 
of 
recycling 
campaigns.
I offer my opinion, as well. It 
starts with the people. No matter 
how we do clean up the planet, 
via recycling or redesigning, the 
facts need to be dispersed and 
understood. It is inspiring to 
hear a room of environmental 
professionals discuss the future 
of the world, but now what? What 
about the rest of the country 
— college students, kids in 
elementary school, the ones who 
don’t read the newspaper every 
day? We were kids when schools 
began cutting worksheets in half 
in order to save paper. We are the 
ones who refill water bottles and 
opt to ride bikes instead of cars. 
This is where behavior change 
starts: consumers must become 
aware and use that knowledge to 
act accordingly.
In the 1960s and ’70s, concern 
about the environment spiked 
for the first time, as did the 
desire 
to 
utilize 
reusables 
and 
recyclables. 
However, 
environmental activism was not 
born overnight. One by one, U.S. 
citizens began to recognize what 
we had done to our environment, 
and consequently changed their 
ways. “People start pollution, 
people can stop it” was a popular 
motto of the era, Kingsbury 
said. He says the ’70s gave rise 
to terms like “litterbug,” which 
deflected the responsibility of 
waste from manufacturers to 
consumers.To incite behavior 
change, the people who knew 
the facts took the podium. In 
1976 the EPA published a report 
that outlined the problems of 
pollution. The small set of pages 
was sent around the nation; it 
provided the public with the 

truth and motivation to act. 
The pamphlet explained in the 
’60s, the U.S. was running out of 
water because as the population 
grew, the amount of rain stayed 
the same; the population grew 
from 150 million in 1950 to 
190 million in 1964, and has 
nearly doubled since 1950 as 
we approach 2020. Water use 
per person was also growing, 
the booklet explained. From 
1900 to 1964, individual water 
use had quadrupled, bringing 
total water use as a country to 
about 300 billion gallons per 
day. Showers, lawn sprinklers, 
washing machines and industry 
were a few of the main culprits. 
Water, the essential component 
for everything living on Earth, 
was facing the possibility of a 
shortage.
What was the practical, long-
term answer? According to the 
booklet, the key was reusing 
water and taking political action 
with federal, state and local 
governments. It urged the public 
to ask the right questions and 
seek accurate answers.
This is precisely what our 
campus, town, state and country 
need today: the facts. Did you 
know that our country uses 
more than 322 billion gallons of 
water per day, and Washtenaw 
Country 
uses 
30.3 
million 
gallons per day? Let’s try to use 
less. The U.S. transportation 
sector is responsible for roughly 
30 percent of our country’s 
emissions of greenhouse gases, 
which contribute to climate 
change. 
The 
auto 
industry 
is 
therefore 
headed 
toward 
autonomous, electric cars to 
make the environment “cleaner.” 
What you should know, however, 
is that driverless cars do save 
fuel and reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions, but electric cars 
might not be as clean as we 
think. We can listen to Leonard 
or Kingsbury, or even combine 
both 
of 
their 
arguments; 
however, the truth is some 18 
billion pounds of plastic wind up 
in the ocean each year. We need 
to figure out how to stop that — 
perhaps by consuming less, or 
perhaps by cleaning up what’s 
already out there. We seemingly 
cannot control climate change, 
but the resources and knowledge 
are here, folks. We need to first 
know the facts, since countering 
climate change starts with the 
people.

Retailer woes
S

ears, the retailer found in 
shopping malls across the U.S. 
and “The Original Everything 
Store,” filed for bankruptcy early in 
the morning Oct. 15. The 125-year-old 
American staple reached a deal with 
lenders that involved closing 142 stores 
by the end of the year. What lies ahead 
for the company is uncertain, but its 
seven-year streak of net losses signal 
that the company may face complete 
liquidation in the foreseeable future.
Liquidation will have overarching 
 
implications for the nearly 70,000 
individuals currently employed by 
Sears. These lives will take a drastic 
turn for the worse when the company 
finally closes all of its doors and these 
individuals find themselves out of 
work. The liquidation will also affect 
over 100,000 pensioners who earned 
that regular income when they once 
worked at the company.
Sears is yet another instance of the 
serious implications that technological 
disruption has had on the retail 
industry. The expansion of online 
shopping, due to the rise of Amazon, 
has had drastic consequences for the 
U.S. economy. 
In the years from 2012 to 2017, 
250,000 department store employees 
found themselves unemployed from 
aggressive 
industry-wide 
layoffs. 
While this statistic is concerning, it’s 
nothing compared to the 6.2 million 
individuals who could find themselves 
without a job in the future thanks to 
intense competition with Amazon.

While technological disruption 
and Amazon is certainly causing 
headaches in the retail industry, many 
retailers struggle with something else: 
Retailers are battling to overcome 
the hefty debt burdens brought on by 
private equity investors.
To illustrate this problem, let’s 
look at Toys R Us, the toy retailer that 
was forced to liquidate in June this 
year. Toys R Us was bought out in 
2005 by the private equity firms Bain 
Capital and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts 
along with the real-estate firm 
Vornado Realty Trust. To purchase 
the company, the private equity 
investors loaded the company with 
debt to minimize risk and boost their 
eventual return.
Bryce Covert detailed the impact 
of this buyout in a piece published 
by The Atlantic. He wrote that 2007 
interest expense (cash that needs to be 
paid every year to creditors) consumed 
97 percent of the company’s operating 
profit. As the company faced fierce 
competition, Toys R Us should have 
used this operating profit to fund 
projects that could have improved 
the company’s performance, like 
upgrading stores or enhancing its 
online presence. Instead, the firm 
was forced to use its capital to pay off 
creditors.
When the Great Recession hit 
and revenue fell, Toys R Us struggled 
to afford its regular interest expenses 
and debt repayments. The debt burden 
hurt the firm’s chances of weathering 

the recession and overcoming the 
challenges posed by the rise of online 
shopping and Amazon.
As it turns out, private equity-
backed retailers that have filed for 
bankruptcy are more common than 
you may expect. In this past year, 
Payless ShoeSource Inc., the shoe 
retailer 
with 
22,000 
employees 
worldwide, and Gymboree, a clothing 
outlet with 11,000 employees, filed for 
bankruptcy. Both companies, along 
with a slew of others, struggle with 
the massive debt burden forced upon 
them by private equity investors. 
FTI Consulting found two-thirds of 
the retailers that filed for Chapter 11 
bankruptcy in 2016 and 2017 were 
backed by private equity.
As retailers struggle to fight back 
against Amazon, their debt burdens 
will put them at a serious disadvantage. 
The combination of these components 
will have major implications for the 
millions of individuals affected and 
the U.S. economy as a whole.
As Amazon grows, retailers will 
increasingly end up like Sears or Toys 
R Us. Amazon needs to recognize 
and manage its immense impact on 
the economy. While the company 
has made progress in providing more 
value to the workforce, like its recent 
decision to raise its minimum wage 
to $15 an hour, the company could be 
doing more.

What to do about the things we cannot control

The power of women’s rage
Y

ou probably did not learn it in 
history class growing up. You 
probably did not learn it in any 
books. You probably have never even 
thought about. You still may not even 
know it. But, you should.
What you probably don’t know 
is that women’s rage has been at the 
root of almost every social change 
movement 
since 
this 
country’s 
founding. We are taught mostly of 
the patriotic and heroic anger of men 
in our history class. We learn of the 
virtuous, masculine anger fueling 
the rebellions and revolts that won us 
our independence. We revere those 
men that dumped tea into the Boston 
Harbor in an ultimate act of resistance 
to tyrannical taxation. We honor the 
men who bravely endured the walk 
across the Edmund Pettus bridge in 
Selma, Alabama. We empathize with 
the men who refused, even at the risk 
of arrest, to be drafted to serve in the 
Vietnam War.
Yet, we never learn of the 
indispensable women at the heart of 
many of these movements. We are 
not taught the names of the women in 
the Student Nonviolent Coordinating 
Committee who demanded equal 
opportunity and treatment in a 
movement based on equal rights. 
We are not taught the names of the 
women in the Young Lords Party 
who performed the labor of teaching 
the male leaders of their party the 
harmful impact of their machismo-
based actions. Even though Black 
Lives Matter is only four years old, we 
are not taught the names of the three 
women whose activism and refusal 
to be silenced founded this powerful 
and well-known movement. While we 
might learn of the women’s suffrage 
movement of the early 20th century 

in passing, it is seldom pointed out 
how it only guaranteed white women 
the right to vote or how many of the 
women recognized as leaders of those 
movements held shameful white 
supremacist attitudes.
Even worse than those who 
are assigned the task of teaching 
us everything we do not know 
gatekeeping crucial historical facts, 
children, by preschool age, are taught 
that boys can freely express their 
anger while girls must suppress theirs. 
In academic and professional settings, 
women and girls are disdained, or 
even punished, for expressing anger 
or discontent with any sort of gender-
based oppression.
This type of penalty is experienced 
by women of all kinds, from celebrities 
to regular citizens. Tennis star Serena 
Williams is routinely punished for 
her expression of rage, which was 
evident at the U.S. Open earlier this 
year when a male referee took away a 
whole game after Williams demanded 
an apology for his botched call earlier 
in the match, ordinary women also 
experience decreased status and 
perceived incompetence versus male 
employees who are more likely to 
be hired and given more power and 
autonomy in their jobs when they 
express anger.
It is also important to note that 
women of color, and Black women in 
particular, face additional abuse at the 
hands of white men when they express 
their ire. The stereotype of the angry 
Black woman, and the subsequent 
treatment of their anger as irrational, 
reinforces racist practices that often 
lead to harsher consequences than 
white women face.
Still, despite all of the attempted 
stymying of women and their anger, 

women have been raging since the 
dawn of time. If you are inclined to 
the Christian story of human origin, 
you might want to consider how 
Eve’s rebellious consumption from 
the tree of knowledge was fueled by 
her displeasure for the ignorance 
enforced upon her by God. If you are 
not, all you have to do is read a book or 
study some history, albeit not the same 
selective history you were probably 
taught in school, to understand how 
instrumental women and their rage 
were and are to progress.
Not sure where to start? There 
are two books that offer the best 
history and analysis of women’s rage: 
“Good and Mad: The Revolutionary 
Power of Women’s Anger” by Rebecca 
Traister and “Rage Becomes Her: The 
Power of Women’s Anger by Soraya 
Chemaly. Once you have learned the 
value of women’s rage from those two 
brilliant books, ladies: let your rage out; 
men: listen to and support our rage. 
While doctors and medical websites 
are clear that bottling up anger can 
have health implications, such as 
stress and anxiety, it is also the male 
response to women’s anger, calling 
outspoken women “crazy bitches” 
or undermining them with claims of 
overreaction, that induces even more 
stress and frustration, ultimately 
leading women to hold it in even more 
for fear of repudiation and further the 
damage on their health.

Eat your vegetables
M

y family isn’t big on 
birthday presents. Most 
years I get a nice sweater, 
wool socks to replace those I have 
worn through and a homemade cake. 
So I was surprised on my 18th birthday 
when my mom, straining from the 
weight, handed me a massive box 
wrapped in red paper. I tore it open to 
find a bright white KitchenAid mixer, 
with three paddle attachments and 
a big silver bowl. I suspect most 18 
year olds would only be so excited to 
receive a kitchen appliance to celebrate 
their first year of legal adulthood. I, 
however, was ecstatic. 
Since middle school, I have loved 
to bake. I love the creativity of it. I 
love concocting new recipes in my 
head, the feeling of flour on my fingers 
and that sore ache in my arms after 
kneading dough or whipping egg 
whites. I love making a cheeky little 
piece of goodness. I love getting to lick 
the spoon.
Most special to me, though, was 
how my baking made others feel. 
It became tradition that I made a 
birthday cake for each of my friends, 
and I enjoyed making them feel worth 
all the time it took to decorate. I loved 
baking fudgy brownies to make 
studying for AP exams a little more 
bearable for my friends. I reveled in the 
look on people’s faces when I walked 
into the room with my signature red-
topped tupperware, and how they all 
gathered around to wait for me to lift 
the lid and reveal whatever heaven I 
had whipped up for that day.
Baking was also a ploy to make 
myself likable. I figured out early on 
in my baking career that bringing 
cupcakes to class was a great way 
to get on everyone’s good side, and I 
became very comfortable living there. 
It made interacting with others feel 
safer, as though I already knew their 
evaluation of me would come out as 
a net positive. I never wanted any 

trouble, I didn’t want to step on any 
toes and I never wanted to be worse 
than neutral in someone’s eyes. People 
tend not to take issue with you when 
they associate you with dessert, and 
my irksome craving to be liked kept 
my kitchen busy.
“I make smiles with a big silver 
bowl” is the first line of a poem I started 
when I was 17 but never finished. It still 
conjures for me the feeling of cradling a 
mixing bowl in the crook of my arm as 
I slide a silicon spatula around its edges 
with a practiced twirl. It is a nostalgic 
feeling — I don’t have the same time, 
space or energy to cook in college as I 
did in high school. I also don’t have as 
much time for the sentiment. Though 
appeasing others remains my instinct, 
I work hard to convince myself that it 
is neither necessary or healthy. There 
are arguments to make, policies to 
propose and national political battles 
to be fought, and none of them will 
be solved with fudge (actually, I 
would argue that my chili-chocolate 
fudge could probably go a long way to 
mitigate national conflicts, but you get 
my point).
I have always fled from conflict. 
I joke with friends that choosing 
a major like public policy, where 
every essay and assignment means 
choosing a side on a divisive topic, 
was a somewhat masochistic choice. 
Disagreements make me squirm. 
Serious confrontation is like torture.
However, in my adventures down 
the rabbit hole of modern politics, I’ve 
found that there are certain conflicts 
that don’t make me want to run and 
hide. I will happily do battle for a 
woman’s right to choose. Immigration 
reform and immigrants’ rights? I’ll 
confront you ten ways to Sunday. 
Policies that disenfranchise minority 
voters? Debate me, I dare you.
Passion shuts up my inner 
peacemaker. I have come to see the 
part of myself that replaces conflict 

with cookies as this older woman 
who just wants everyone to sit down 
for some tea and chat about “This Is 
Us.” Turns out, though, that she lived 
through the ‘60s and burned her fair 
share of bras and marched in her fair 
share of protests. She fights her own 
battles, she just also loves pie.
Conflict is certainly not something 
I seek out, but I have come to realize 
how important it is to be willing to 
disagree with someone, both for myself 
and for the nation in this particularly 
divisive time when national values 
formerly deemed intrinsic have been 
called into question. Respectful debate 
and argument are valuable and help 
us grow and learn. Positive conflict 
can be like eating your vegetables. It’s 
not everyone’s favorite thing, but it 
makes you stronger and better, and it’s 
unhealthy to avoid it completely.
I love to bake. I love the warm 
comfort of making something that 
will make someone else content for a 
moment. But a growing young woman 
needs more than just pleasantries and 
chocolate. She needs to be challenged 
and pushed. She needs to learn to 
construct a valid argument, to engage 
with the world around her and be 
willing to fight for something she 
believes in, even if it means finally 
suggesting to her roomates that they 
clean their dirty dishes in the sink.
I’ll always make smiles with my 
big silver bowl. But from now on when 
I find the precious time to slip on my 
apron and roll up my sleeves, I will 
try to do it for myself and not to avoid 
an interaction that could encourage 
me to grow. A balanced meal can be 
difficult to come across in college, but 
we should all try to remember to eat 
our vegetables before we get around 
to dessert.

MUSIC ALBUM REVIEW

Lorely Rodriguez makes music 
that weaponizes awkwardness. 
Her debut album under the alias 
Empress Of, 2015’s Me, has a kind 
of chaotic momentum to it, at once 
a little messy and compellingly 
energetic. It sounds both like the 
majority of pop music and also 

like nothing in particular. At her 
best moments, she produces a 
convincing synthesis, capitulating 
neither to the undertow of dance 
music or the voice-centeredness 
of pop (see: “How Do You Do It” 
and “Kitty Kat”).
Her lyrics are ambiguous and 
occasionally bizarre, close rhymes 
piling up on top of each other and 
sentences left unfinished. Her 
vocal delivery is delicate, and her 
instrumentals 
bristle, 
crackle 
and cut. Her first few projects are 
comparable in style to FKA Twigs, 
Björk and Grimes, although her 
music is strongly individual and 
she’s resisted comparisons to 
Grimes, specifically stating, “You 
can’t hear the lyrics in a lot of her 
songs, but for me, when I mixed 
this record I needed to hear every 
word. The lyrics are my story and 
I needed my story to be heard.”

Her new album, Us, released 
three years after Me, clarifies and 
updates her sound. In the time 
between, she has collaborated 
with Dev Hynes (aka Blood 
Orange), Jerome Potter (half of 
DJDS) and Khalid, and her style 
shows a new maturity as well 
as some stylistic traits of her 
collaborators. The big-room EDM 
is largely replaced with R&B-
inflected grooves, while keeping 
the electropop scaffolding. “Trust 
Me Baby” is a good example: It has 
the mobile bassline and synths of 
her earlier music while adding 
808 drums and neater phrases. 
Even when she does write a four-
on-the-floor groove (“Just The 
Same” and “Love For Me”), the 
beat has a newfound shuffle, with 
none of the motoric quality of her 
older work like “Water Water.”
Her sound design and mixing 
similarly borrow from R&B in a 
way that they haven’t before, and 
the album benefits tremendously 
for it. Her synths lose their 
overwhelming quality, and her 
talents as a songwriter and 
vocalist 
are 
front-and-center. 
A lot of what makes Me feel 
messy is how much high-end 
frequencies crowd out the vocals. 
While Us generally solves this, 
her abilities as a producer still 
shine through — the airy energy 
of “I Don’t Even Smoke Weed” or 
the breathtaking space of “Again” 
are recognizable to her style, as 
are the meandering melodies 
and sharp percussion that cover 
the album. She alchemizes the 

sometimes 
unclear 
energies 
of Me into self-assured sultry 
slow dances (“Trust Me Baby”) 
and energetic electropop tracks 
(“I’ve Got Love”), transmuting 
the washed-out pastels into a 
Californian 
neon-and-sunset 
glow.
It’s interesting that the two 
tracks 
in 
which 
Rodriguez 
explores her insecurities in the 
same way that she did in Me are 

also the two tracks that resemble 
the first album sonically. “All 
For Nothing” and “When I’m 
With Him” both have the sort of 
stuttering melodies and repetitive 
drums of her first album. These 
are songs where there are lyrics 
about feeling unsure (“I can’t help 
but repress / all the signs / that tell 
me I’m not fine,” “I feel like I’m 
on the outside looking in / when 
I’m with him” ). So much of her 
first album was about struggling 
to get somewhere, artistically 
and 
otherwise 
— 
“I’ve 
been 
living below the 
standard / with 
a 
hunger 
that 
fuels the fire” 
from “Standard” 
is 
emblematic. 
Us seems to show 
a 
newfound 
confidence 
that 
suits 
her 
well, but songs 
like 
“All 
For 
Nothing” 
make 
a 
connection 
between 
her 
older 
material 
and 
this 
newfound 
ambition.
She ties the 
album 
together 
with the closing 
track “Again.” It 
seems to respond 
to her anxieties: 
“I know it’s not 
always 
perfect 
/ if I had the 
chance I’d do it 
all again.” A song 
is 
the 
perfect 
vehicle 
for 
a 
statement 
that 
can otherwise be 
a platitude, and 
in the context 
of the album, it 
builds a bridge 
between 
the 
anxious 
energy 
of Me and her 
newfound 
confidence. 
The embrace of 
imperfection 
is 
not a new theme, 
but when done 
by an artist like 
Rodriguez 
who 
has 
shown 
so 
much of herself, 
the listener feels 
the full weight 
of 
lines 
that 
would be cliché 
elsewhere.

WORLD MUSIC COLUMN

Every once in a while, among 
the hordes of wannabe Mac 
Demarcos and uninspired Tame 
Impala clones, a gem pops up 
on Bandcamp. One recent such 
gem called Crumbling comes 
from South Korea. An album 
by the group Mid-Air Thief, it 
seems to have received literally 
no promotion until it suddenly 
gained traction on internet fora 
such 
as 
RateYourMusic. 
No 
interviews with the group exist, 
and the Bandcamp page features 
little else other than a thank you 
message in Korean. However, the 
album itself is a breath of fresh 
air and one of the strongest, most 
unique releases of 2018.
Despite its lo-fi aesthetic, the 
album is actually impeccably 
produced. For the most part, it is 
rather straightforward indie folk 
or pop, but its best moments come 
from the points it transitions into 

more psychedelic territory. The 
opening track “Why” is the best 
example of this. It begins with a 
minute of your standard acoustic 
strumming and breathy vocals 
before 
entering 
a 
powerful 
chorus backed up by a variety of 
synthesizers. The track quickly 
deconstructs, 
spending 
the 
following three minutes with 
synth glitches crossing back and 
forth between both channels, 
eventually accompanied by the 
lead singer’s wordless vocals and 
an irregular drum pattern.
The second track, “These 
Chains,” is the album’s strongest. 
It 
constantly 
experiments 
with its own core melody, 
eschewing traditional structure 
and also using different ranges 
to 
heighten 
the 
effects 
of 
the 
psychedelic 
flourishes. 
Moreover, unlike most lackluster 
examples of psychedelic rock, 
the psychedelic moments are 
not there for the sake of existing, 
but rather to complement and 
enhance 
the 
main 
melody 

extremely well.
Influences from all over pop 
up in this album; from Animal 
Collective to Cocteau Twins 
to Real Estate and Grizzly 
Bear. Crumbling manages to 
synthesize 
these 
influences 
into a whole that is even more 
layered and intricate. Even after 
multiple listens, there are little 
details 
to 
notice, 
especially 
during the breakdowns such 
as the second half of the track 
“Curve and Light.” Its brightest 
moments remind me closely of 
Real Estate’s Days, which also 
contains several moments where 
the band “locks in” and creates a 
rare moment of bliss.
Crumbling is the quintessential 
fall album in all aspects, with 
even the album art contributing 
to the necessity to listen to it on 
a cloudy day at the beach or a 
misty morning. It is creatively 
produced and an increasingly 
rare example of psychedelia with 
actual pop sensibilities done 
right.

FILM REVIEW

It’s 
spooky 
season 
and, 
normally, I like to steer clear 
of any Halloween movie that 
isn’t from Disney Channel. 
“Apostle,” however, wrecked 
that so thoroughly detailed 
strategy of mine, with its 
creepy and increasingly gory 

depiction of life in a religious 
cult on a remote island which 
some 
random 
white 
man 
named 
Thomas 
Richardson 
(Dan 
Stevens, 
“Downton 
Abbey”) infiltrates in order to 
save his sister. 
The movie begins with a 
gorgeous, wide view of the 
Welsh countryside and a very 
Harry 
Potter-esque 
train 
peacefully ambling towards 
the camera. Inside, however, 
Thomas 
is 
anything 
but 
peaceful as he gets closer and 
closer to the home of the cult. 
Upon arrival to the island, 
there are various wide-set 
shots of lush nature, lulling the 
audience into a false sense of 
security only to jar them back 
to reality with a shaky close-up 
of Thomas’s bloodshot eyes. 
On the surface, “Apostle” 
reads like any movie focused 
on a religious cult would. It’s 
set in a society built on the lies 
of Prophet Malcolm (Michael 
Sheen, “Passengers”), a power-
hungry, albeit faithful, leader 
and his equally greedy partner 
Quinn (Mark Lewis Jones, 
“Star Wars: The Last Jedi”). 
The two apparently spread 
the message that “she” sends 
and, rather than worshipping 
God or Malcolm, the people 
apparently worship an island 
goddess. 
This 
goddess, 
however, is not just some 
made-up higher being. About 
30 minutes into the movie, 

the audience learns that she 
is an actual, physical woman 
that 
Malcolm 
and 
Quinn 
had 
trapped 
years 
earlier 
when they discovered that 
feeding her blood resulted in 
successful crops. The issue 
they face now, though, is that 
she is apparently poisoning the 
land, making it impossible for 
the community to survive and 
the real reason Thomas has 
come to the island. 
As one would also expect, 
sexual 
tension 
is 
rampant 
throughout the movie. Thomas 
and 
Prophet 
Malcolm’s 
daughter, 
unsurprisingly, 
have a few moments but the 
real emotional turmoil comes 
from the teenage relationship 
of Ffion (Kristine Froseth, 
“Sierra Burgess is a Loser”) and 
Jeremy (Bill Milner, “X-Men: 
First Class”) that flowered in 
spite of, or maybe because of, 
the natural religious distaste 
of anything sexual occurring 
out of wedlock. This subplot 
was arguably the best part of 
the movie, and the saddest, as 
our star-crossed lovers had to 
deal with the consequences 
of an unplanned pregnancy. 
Inevitably, 
the 
two 
were 
murdered by none other than 
Quinn, Ffion’s insane father. 
The sad part is you really 
knew that Jeremy and Ffion 
loved each other. Even worse, 
Jeremy and Thomas developed 
a brotherly relationship. So 
not only did we have to watch 
two young lovers die, but we 
also had to watch Thomas lose 
one of his only friends on that 
island. There was really no one 
else on the island like them 
and, when they died, I lost 
any hope I had for any kind of 
happy ending. 
“Apostle” is predictable in its 
exploration of a cult and, when 
Netflix tries to combat this 
with the island goddess twist, 
the movie becomes just another 
scary Halloween movie instead 
of a psychological religious 

thriller. The one thing that kept 
nagging at me throughout the 
whole movie, though, is how 
similar “Apostle” was to the 
recent kid’s movie “Smallfoot.” 
Both were forays into societies 
built on propaganda and their 
subsequent demise, yet one had 
catchy songs and didn’t give 

me nightmares. “Apostle” also 
had a very similar premise to 
Disney’s “Moana” in that both 
islands are being poisoned by 
an angered goddess who just 
wants her life back. “Apostle,” 
then, is simply a creepier, more 
British, and less entertaining 
version of two very good kid’s 
movies.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com


After 
nearly 
a 
decade 
of 
E-commerce 
business, 
Jean 
Jean Vintage needed a physical 
space. The vintage and antique 
jewelry store had previously 
lived exclusively on Etsy, but 
owner Emily Duffelmeyer was 
constantly fielding requests for 
in-person appointments. In a 
phone interview with The Daily, 
Duffelmeyer opened up about her 
business.
“I was getting more and more 
requests 
for 
appointments, 
especially from people who were 
wanting to invest in higher priced 
items, and they really wanted to 
see them first and try them on 
first,” Duffelmeyer said. “And 
I really had no way of hosting 
appointments 
because 
I 
was 
working out of my house.”
But Duffelmeyer’s motivations 
for 
breaking 
ground 
extend 
further 
than 
run-of-the-mill 
growing pains. She also cited 
a strong desire to be a visible 
part of Lansing’s small business 
community, 
and 
to 
have 
a 
space “where (she) could sort 

of continue to build the brand 
identity of Jean Jean visually, 
so the store could start to be 
associated with the brand; what 
are the colors, what does it smell 
like, what’s the music like, what’s 
the vibe of the store?”
As someone who has made the 
pilgrimage to Jean Jean’s physical 
location — and very nearly got 
stuck in Lansing in the process — 
I can speak from experience about 
the store’s affect. The place looks 
as crushed velvet feels. It is dark, 
moody and has a quiet opulence. 
The walls are painted a forest 
green and exquisite glass jewelry 
cases line the edges. It is clear to 
all who step foot in the premises 
that the store was designed by a 
masterful eye.
When 
asked 
about 
her 
inspiration for the space’s design, 
Duffelmeyer confessed an interest 
in creating a place reminiscent of 
the natural history museums of 
her childhood. “I remember going 
to old natural history museums on 
college campus when I was a kid — 
my parents worked at Iowa State 
University, and my grandparents 
were at (the University of Kansas). 
Those dimly-lit natural history 
museums from the ’60s, where the 

colors were sort of dark and the 
lights were low, and you had this 
sense that you were going back in 
time a little bit. So, I wanted the 
space to be a luxurious museum 
feel.”
In 
our 
conversation, 
Duffelmeyer also expressed a 
wish to diverge from the normal 
when it came to Jean Jean Vintage. 
“(Jewelry stores tend to be) really 
bright and sparkling and there’s 
track lighting everywhere and 
everything is shiny and sparkling, 
and I wanted to basically do the 
opposite of that.”
The store houses Jean Jean 
Vintage’s 
extensive 
vintage 
and antique jewelry collection, 
although most of the items can 
still be found on the Etsy shop that 
started it all. In both locations, 
one can find incredible one-of-
a-kind items such as an antique 
Russian Imperial gemstone insect 
brooch or a vintage ’30s Art Deco 
onyx and diamond cocktail ring, 
although Duffelmeyer tends to 
stock pieces that are between 70 
to 120 years old.
“I would say that what I’m 
known for is Victorian and Art 
Deco costume and fine jewelry,” 
Duffelmeyer said. “And in the 

last couple of years I’ve started 
shifting my focus to bridal jewelry 
from the same period.”
However, this was not always 
the case; when she was first 
starting, 
Duffelmeyer 
sold 
primarily 
costume 
jewelry, 
and initially built a name for 
herself through her collection of 
Czechoslovakian glass jewelry. 
She explains, “in the late 1800s 
and into the early 1900s the United 
States imported a lot of glass 
jewelry 
from 
Czechoslovakia, 
(then the) epicenter of fine hand-
faceted crystal and glass. Czech 
glass jewelry is something that 
collectors love because it is 
very intricate, and the glass is 
beautifully cut and it’s usually 
brightly colored and set in brass 
— but there’s oftentimes beautiful 
enamel accent. It has a lot of 
defining characteristics and it’s 
not made anymore.”
However, unlike other vintage 
and antique jewelry stores, Jean 
Jean Vintage paradoxically does 
not exclusively sell vintage and 
antique jewelry. In addition to 
acquiring and selling archival 
pieces, 
Duffelmeyer 
produces 
her own signature collection, 
the Jean Jean Vintage cachet 
collection. The cachet collection 

is at once new and antique: The 
pendants, rings and cufflinks are 
cast from letter seals from the 
1800s.
“If you were living in (the) 
mid-19th century and writing 
letters you probably had some 
wax seals at your desk,” she said. 
“You may have used a family 
crest, like in ring, to seal all of 
your correspondence, or you 
may have had sort of a set that 
you could rotate through to pick 
the right seal for the right letter. 
And the idea of sealing, besides 
being utilitarian way of closing 
a document, (was that) the seal 
on the outside was the first thing 
the recipient would see. And so, 
whatever you chose to stamp in 
that seal was kind of like a preview 
to the content of the letter or the 
message.” An old-fashioned email 
subject line.
The collection is captivating, in 
large part because the sentiments 
expressed on the pieces still 
resonate in a modern context.
“I love that it’s made from 
200-year-old artifacts that — even 
though they’re old sentiments — 
they’re Victorian sentiments — 
(are) still really relevant today,” 
Duffelmeyer said.
The pieces bear an image and 

an inscription, either in French, 
Italian or Latin. One popular 
piece features a sailboat on a 
turbulent sea, with the phrase 
“e cosi la mia vita,” or “such is 
life,” on one side, and a butterfly 
approaching a flower with the 
word “attendo,” or “I am waiting,” 
on the other. “As if the flower is 
talking to the butterfly (saying), 
‘I’ve been waiting for you to come 
land on me,’” she said. “It would 
be the kind of seal you would use 
to seal a love letter.”
As 
for 
the 
name, 
Jean 
Jean 
Vintage 
comes 
from 
Duffelmeyer’s middle name. “My 
dad called me Jean Jean when I 
was a little girl. He died before 
I started the business so when I 
was thinking of names, that just 
kept coming to mind. My mother’s 
middle name is Jean, too, so it’s 
kind of like the doubling of the 
name with my mom as well as the 
happy memory of that nickname 
from my dad.”
When listening to Duffelmeyer 
describe the origin of the name, 
I was struck by the poetry in 
it; a name handed down from 
older generations has come to 
represent a business that hands 
down heirlooms to individuals 
who wish to connect with history.

Michigan holds on for big win against in-state rival

EAST LANSING — No. 24 
Michigan State had many of the 
requisite elements to upset the 
No.6 Michigan football team 
in crushing, season-tarnishing 
fashion. Turnovers, poor weather 
and missed opportunities 
threatened to prevent the 
Wolverines from delivering their 
dagger — just as they had in 
previous years.W
For a moment Saturday, it 
looked like Michigan State could 
retain the Paul Bunyan Trophy. 
But two second-half touchdowns 
were enough to lift Michigan over 
the Spartans, 21-7, in East Lansing 
on Saturday, in the 950th win in 
program history.
Senior running back Karan 
Higdon, on a rain-drenched 
field, slipped and relinquished 

Michigan’s second fumble of the 
third quarter with the score tied 
at seven. Despite the Wolverines’ 
seeming control of the game, 
momentum flipped the Spartans’ 
way.
Feeling the weight of the 
moment, junior quarterback Shea 
Patterson snuck into the defensive 
huddle before the ensuing drive.
“(He said), ‘Y’all keep doing 
your thing. Let’s get the ball back, 
we’re gonna score,’ ” said junior 
linebacker Devin Bush.
The defense did just that — 
the fourth of six occasions the 
Spartans went three-and-out — 
before Patterson took things into 
his own hands.
Towards the end of the third 
quarter, Patterson completed to 
sophomore receiver Donovan 
Peoples-Jones in-stride, who 
went the distance for a 79-yard, 
go-ahead touchdown.
“The throw to Donovan was 

right on the money,” said coach 
Jim Harbaugh. “Donovan did a 
great job at the line of scrimmage 
against press coverage and 
created the space. And (he) 
created more space after the 
release, made a fabulous over the 
shoulder catch.”
After another Michigan State 
three-and-out, the Wolverines 
were faced with a fourth-and-two 
in Spartan territory. When the 
defense collapsed on sophomore 
fullback Ben Mason, Patterson 
tucked it away and picked up 
the conversion with an 11-yard 
scamper.
It proved to be critical. 
Michigan made it 21-7 soon after 
with a Mason five-yard scoring 
run.
Dagger delivered indeed.
“We’ve been a really good 
third-quarter team and fourth-
quarter team,” Harbaugh said. 
“Guys are playing hard and smart 

the entire ball game. I think we’re 
a well-conditioned team, we’re a 
smart team. I think all that factors 
into it.”
The contest didn’t go without 
its usual rivalry drama, however.
Up 7-0 early in the third 
quarter, junior running back 
Chris Evans fumbled on 
Michigan’s seven-yard line.
The turnover prompted 
Michigan State’s infamous 
trickery. Off a double reverse, 
receiver Darrell Stewart 
completed to quarterback Brian 
Lewerke to tie the game.
But the Spartans’ poor passing 
attack rendered their offense 
disjointed and unable to further 
take advantage. Michigan State 
gained just 94 yards the whole 
game and was 0-for-12 on 3rd 
down. Lewerke, pulled in the 
fourth quarter, finished an 
abysmal 5-for-25 passing.
“Those are the kinds of 

statistics you dream (of),” 
Harbaugh said. “That was a 
dream game.”
Ten minutes of gameplay in, 
inclement weather delayed the 
contest an hour-and-15 minutes.
Michigan continued its first 
scoring drive when play resumed. 
On third down near mid-field, 
Patterson attempted to thread the 
needle to senior receiver Grant 
Perry, but the pass was deflected. 
With Spartans swarming for the 
interception, it was sophomore 
wide receiver Nico Collins who 
corralled the ball for a first 
down. Five runs and a 25-yard 
completion to junior tight end 
Nick Eubanks later, Patterson 
found Collins — cleanly — for a 
six-yard touchdown pass.
But, spectacularly, that was 
the Wolverines’ only score of the 
first half.
Michigan dominated the field 
position battle while stifling 

the Spartans’ offense, starting 
four-straight drives in opposing 
territory during the second 
quarter. But it translated into zero 
points.
Unable to move the ball, the 
Wolverines elected to punt 
from inside Michigan State’s 
40-yard line on three consecutive 
possessions. And when Quinn 
Nordin finally got to test the 
rain-drenched field, the redshirt 
sophomore placekicker shanked a 
36-yard attempt.
Despite a total yardage 
advantage of 170 to 49, Michigan 
took just a 7-0 advantage into 
halftime. But even with the 
momentum teetering back-and-
forth during the second half, the 
Wolverines found their way to a 
needed victory.
“It’s a message to other teams 
that we ain’t coming to play,” 
Bush said. “We’re coming to 
handle business.”

FINAL FROM EAST LANSING

Saturday shows why Michigan, Michigan State rivalry is great

During 
his 
weekly 
teleconference 
Sunday night, 
more than 24 
hours 
after 
it 
happened, 
Michigan 
State 
coach 
Mark 
Dantonio 
was 
asked 
about Saturday’s pregame fracas 
between his team and Michigan.
“I’m 
not 
gonna 
bother 
commenting on it,” Dantonio 
said. “The whole thing to me 
was sort of juvenile to me.”
You can call it juvenile. You 
can call it bush league. You can 
call it B.S. Those are the words 
Dantonio and Jim Harbaugh 
used when talking about the 
incident.
I don’t care how anyone 
describes it. What happened 
yesterday was amazing.
This is the best rivalry that 
both teams have going for them 
right now. With the exception of 
2016, every game in the series’ 
current chapter — Harbaugh vs. 
Dantonio — has been incredible 
and incredibly weird, at the 
same time.
It makes for high-quality 
television. 
It 
makes 
for 
outstanding football games, no 
matter how sloppy they may 
get.
But the previous three games 
were missing something.
They were missing exactly 
what Dantonio thought was 
“sort of juvenile.”
Let’s go back and examine 
what happened. Around two 
hours before the noon kickoff, 
a group of Michigan players 
were on the field stretching. 
Michigan spokesperson Dave 
Ablauf said that the Wolverines 
thought the Spartans would 
arrive for the team’s traditional 
pre-game walk at 9:50; hence 
why Michigan was on the field 
at 10, for the warm-ups before 
the warm-ups.
We don’t know whether there 

was a miscommunication, but 
Michigan State did not arrive 
at 9:50. The Spartans arrived 
at 10 and began walking down 
the field with their arms locked 
and 
helmets 
strapped on at 
10:02.
Michigan’s 
players 
didn’t 
want to move. 
Michigan State 
kept 
walking. 
Which 
meant 
everyone 
else 
got 
to 
watch 
both teams play 
a weird version 
of Red Rover. Fifth-year senior 
defensive 
tackle 
Lawrence 
Marshall 
got 
into 
it 
with 
several Spartans. Sophomore 
cornerback Lavert Hill’s pair 
of very nice black headphones 
were not-so-nicely ripped off. 

Junior linebacker Devin Bush 
Jr. was held back as he yelled at 
Michigan State. Then, minutes 
later, he dug his cleats into 
the ground and mangled the 
Spartan logo at 
midfield.
Damn. 
I 
haven’t 
even 
gotten 
to 
the 
game itself yet 
— which was an 
absolute doozy.
There was a 
long 
weather 
delay. 
There 
were improbable 
completions 
off deflected balls. The bad 
weather came back. Michigan 
State paid homage to Nick Foles 
and the Philly Special. There 
was a one-handed snag by a 
punter, who proceeded to rip 
one for 60 yards. One offense 

heated up down the stretch. 
The other stayed cold all game.
When 
the 
game 
ended, 
Michigan 
rushed 
the 
field 
— as if it had won a national 
championship, 
said 
Michigan 
State 
play-by-
play announcer 
George 
Blaha 
during the live 
radio broadcast 
— and Bush did 
several backflips 
to 
celebrate 
his team’s 21-7 
victory. 
Later, 
Harbaugh sat at a podium 
and made his “bush league” 
comment. In the room next door, 
someone relayed Harbaugh’s 
comments to Dantonio, who 
said, “That’s B.S. You heard me. 
That’s B.S.”

“You guys get your cameras 
out,” he continued. “It’s all on 
Fox. I’m not gonna go to that. 
Go ahead, next question.”
A 
few 
seconds 
later: 
“Bush 
league? 
Mmmhmm.”
Like I said, 
incredible.
We are back 
to 
where 
this 
rivalry was 11 
years ago, when 
former Michigan 
running 
back 
Mike Hart called 
Michigan State 
“little 
brother” 
after 
winning 
his 
fourth 
consecutive game against the 
Spartans.
Dantonio, then in his first 
year coaching the Spartans, hit 
back.
“I find a lot of the things 

they do amusing. They need to 
check themselves sometimes. 
Let’s 
just 
remember, 
pride 
comes before the fall,” he said. 
“They want to mock us, I’m 
telling them, it’s not over. They 
want to print that crap all over 
their locker room, it’s not over 
and it’ll never be over. It’s just 
starting.”
Then he coached Michigan 
State to six wins in the ensuing 
seven years leading up to 
Harbaugh’s arrival. In 2014, 
former Michigan linebacker Joe 
Bolden drove a stake through 
midfield. But that gesture felt 
hollow. The Spartans trounced 
the Wolverines that day, 35-11, 
and former Michigan coach 
Brady Hoke later apologized for 
what Bolden did. 
The series has been much 
closer since then. Both teams 
are now 2-2 in the past four 
years. No one is apologizing for 
anything. 
Let’s hear from fifth-year 
senior defensive end Chase 
Winovich: “We knew that they 
couldn’t hang with us. We did 
what he had to do. Sometimes 
your little brother starts acting 
up, and you just gotta put them 
in place.”
After the game, he tweeted, 
“I’d like to take this moment to 
apologize...FOR ABSOLUTELY 
NOTHING! Go Blue!”
These two teams hate each 
other, they have always hated 
each other and now they’re 
not going to bother trying to 
conceal it.
That’s great. That’s how it 
should be. One team is going to 
spend the next year thinking 
about 
what 
went 
wrong 
Saturday. The other team is 
going to remember what went 
right for a very long time. Next 
year, they’ll do it all over again.
Can’t wait.

The Wolverines notched a 21-7 win over Michigan State in East Lansing on Saturday, their first win on the road over a ranked opponent since the 2006 season.

FOOTBALL
 Pre-game antics fire up ‘M’ defense

EAST LANSING — There was a 
bit of a show before the Michigan 
football team’s 21-7 win over No. 24 
Michigan State.
The details of it, however, are 
unclear.
The Spartans did their usual 
pregame tradition, the “Spartan 
Walk,” in which each member of 
the team links arms and walks the 
length of the field.
Senior safety Tyree Kinnel said 
Michigan State was late, and that 
the Wolverines had been given the 
go-ahead to warmup on the field.
So when the Spartans began 
their walk, they ran into fifth-year 
senior defensive tackle Lawrence 
Marshall, junior corner Lavert Hill 
and junior linebacker Devin Bush. 
Neither side backed down.
Michigan says Marshall was 
clotheslined and Hill had his 
headphones ripped off. Coach 
Jim Harbaugh says Michigan 
State coach Mark Dantonio was 
walking behind the team, smiling. 
Dantonio says that’s not true.
It all culminated in Bush, 
standing on the midfield logo at 
Spartan Stadium and stomping 
repeatedly on the log, leaving a 
large, noticable mark in the middle 
of it..
“I just heard about it, I didn’t 
see it,” Harbaugh said. “… Total 
bush league. Apparently, Coach 
Dantonio was five yards behind 

and all smiling, so, yeah, I think it’s 
bush league. That’s my impression 
of it. But our guys, they didn’t 
blink. They didn’t come here to 
back down or get intimidated by 
anybody.”
Added Bush: “It was pure 
emotion. I did what I did, and, you 
know, I can’t take it back, so it is 
what it is.”
However you want to describe 
the pregame antics, and however 
you want to describe how it 
affected the game, the results speak 
for themselves. The Wolverines 
involved in the skirmish were all 
defenders, and the defense showed 
out.
Michigan held the Spartans 
to 94 total yards. Michigan State 
quarterback Brian Lewerke went 
5-for-25, throwing for just 66 
yards. The Spartans went 0-for-12 
on third-down conversions. They 
averaged just 1.8 yards per play, 
and they possessed the ball for 
18:57, compared to the Wolverines, 
who held it for 41:03.
The list goes on and on.
“Our defense was lights-out 
today,” Harbaugh added. “Holding 
an opponent to 91 yards of total 
offense, and they were 0-for-12 on 
third-down conversions. I mean, 
that’s the kind of statistics you 
dream, as a dream game.”
The 
defense 
was 
needed, 
too. For much of the afternoon, 
Michigan 
could 
get 
nothing 
going on offense. It squandered 
opportunities, and in the second 

half, it turned the ball over.
In fact, the only time Michigan 
State scored was after junior 
running back Chris Evans coughed 
up the ball and the Spartans 
recovered on the 7-yard line.
The Wolverines did make things 
interesting for themselves at the 
end of the game, on what turned 
out to be Michigan State’s final 
drive. The possession began with 
2:38 left, and on the first four plays 
of the drive, Michigan committed 
a penalty, giving the Spartans 
some life and, eventually, the ball 
on the Wolverines’ 24-yard line.
The next play, Bush screamed 
through the offensive line and 
sacked Michigan State backup 
quarterback Rocky Lombardi. The 
play after that, junior defensive 
tackle Michael Dwumfour did the 
same. Just like that, any hopes the 
Spartans had of getting back into 
things were snuffed out, once and 
for all.
When 
the 
game 
ended, 
Michigan 
grabbed 
the 
Paul 
Bunyan Trophy and paraded 
around the field. Bush did a few 
backflips.
It culminated in the Wolverines 
jumping up and down, holding 
the trophy above their heads on 
the midfield logo, the same spot 
Bush made his statement just a few 
hours earlier.
“I mean, we won,” Bush said. 
“So, I mean, we’re gonna celebrate 
our win. We’re taking Paul home, 
and we let everybody know that.”

Peoples-Jones’ touchdown 
changes Michigan’s trajectory

EAST LANSING — Nico Collins 
and Donovan Peoples-Jones talked 
earlier in the week about their 
touchdown celebrations if they 
scored at Michigan State.
It’s practically a weekly ritual for 
the sophomore wide receivers. The 
duo, thrusted into the spotlight as 
the team’s premier pass catchers, 
knows 
opportunities 
to 
find 
paydirt are more frequent than last 
season. But in a rivalry game, the 
conversation was quick — mimic the 
stance on the Paul Bunyan Trophy, 
the one that belongs to them.
And on the season’s most perfect 
throw at the most critical juncture 
of the No. 6 Michigan football 
team’s 21-7 victory, Peoples-Jones 
did exactly that.
The Wolverines and 24th-ranked 
Spartans were tied, 7-7, with 2:35 left 
in the third quarter. Positioned at 
the Michigan 21-yard line, Peoples-
Jones pushed off Michigan State’s 
Tre Person in man coverage, and 
had a step on him streaking down 
the right sideline.
“We had Donovan in one-on-one 
coverage, good luck with that,” said 
junior quarterback Shea Patterson, 
who finished with 212 yards and 
two touchdowns. “Just threw it up 
to him and he made a hell of a play 
after the catch.”
With all the time in the world, 
and with Sean McKeon and Zach 
Gentry blanketed on mirrored out 
routes, Patterson stepped up and hit 
Peoples-Jones in stride. Patterson 
lunged, and Peoples-Jones kicked 
out of his grip to stroll into a 79-yard 
touchdown and the Bunyan stance.
“From the start, the line did 
a great job of giving Shea time 
to deliver, which I think was 
the most perfect pass that he’s 
delivered,” Peoples-Jones said of his 
touchdown.
Added coach Jim Harbaugh: 
“That was the huge one, the one to 
Donovan. That throw was really 
right on the money. Donovan did a 
great job at the line of scrimmage 
against the press coverage and 
created some space, then created 
more space after the release. Made 

a fabulous over the shoulder catch.
“… That was a great time for that 
play to happen in the ball game.”
The Wolverines, muffled from 
over-conservative play-calling and 
insufficient execution, were initially 
writing a story for another arm-
wrestle with the Spartans. But the 
connection between Patterson and 
Peoples-Jones — the first true deep 
shot of the game — represented 
more than commanding a lead. 
After a laborious game that, up 
to that point, featured 16 punts, 
three fumbles and momentum in 
Michigan State’s favor, the pass 
signified all the differences a year 
can make.
Patterson read his progressions 
comfortably behind a confident 
offensive line — one that senior 
running back Karan Higdon called 
the “best in the country” for the 
second 
straight 
week. 
Behind 
that line, Patterson was a capable 
thrower who can place a football 
with pinpoint accuracy.
The 
touchdown 
deflated 
Michigan State, which struggled 
wire-to-wire to generate any offense 
of its own. It’s No. 1 rush defense 
in the country surrendered almost 
triple its per game average, with 144 
of the yards belonging to Higdon.
“We were motivated from the 

start,” Higdon said. “They were 
talking trash all week, we stayed 
quiet, stayed in our space and we 
knew what it was gonna be when 
we got here and we just elevated our 
enthusiasm.”
It was a dogfight clouded with 
the revelry that this historic rivalry 
possesses, but with a difference-
making touchdown that redefined 
the image of 2018 Michigan football. 
Following resounding wins over 
Michigan State and Wisconsin in 
back-to-back weeks, the noise of 
a team that doesn’t show up in big 
games was muted.
It’s a credit to an unwavering 
defense that has shined each year of 
the Harbaugh era. And now, it’s also 
a credit to the Patterson-led offense 
that can air out the ball when it 
needs it most and succeed.
“That was one of the most gritty 
games I’ve been a part of,” Patterson 
said. “The defense put us in good 
situations, they were playing lights 
out. That gave us confidence to stay 
within ourselves, so that when we 
get that moment to break through 
we’re not gonna give it back.”
And 
with 
PeopleS-Jones’ 
touchdown, 
the 
Wolverines 
never relented. The Paul Bunyan 
Trophy turned from celebration to 
hardware returning to Ann Arbor.

It’s time to believe

EAST 
LANSING 
— 
It 
was 
a 
scene 
not 
even 
Michigan 
State coach 
Mark 
Dantonio 
himself 
could 
have 
scripted. 
Rain 
pouring down for the second 
storm of the day, for the second 
consecutive year, Spartan fans 
gradually rising from the prior 
malaise 
with 
each 
passing 
moment.
All it took was a Chris Evans 
fumble on Michigan’s own 
10-yard line to turn that energy 
up to a fever pitch. Then, in a 
trademark Dantonio Moment, 
the Spartans tied the game 
on a wide receiver pass to 
quarterback Brian Lewerke — 
the Philly Special, as seen most 
famously in last year’s Super 
Bowl.
You’d seen this script before, 
and you knew how it ended. 
This is where Michigan lays 
down. 
The 
mentally-tough 
Spartans do what they do the 
way they want to do it, the 
way they’ve done it eight of 
the past 11 seasons against the 
Wolverines.
After seven breezy weeks, 
you wanted a test of this team’s 
mental fortitude? There it was. 
And with it rested the hopes 
and 
dreams 
of 
Michigan’s 
season, teetering precariously 
in the balance.
Then, 
junior 
quarterback 
Shea Patterson found Donovan 
Peoples-Jones for a 79-yard 
touchdown — a throw Peoples-
Jones called “the most perfect 
pass” — and the rain subsided. 

And so did the monkey draped 
on 
Michigan’s 
back, 
as 
it 
paraded to a 21-7 win.
“This was big time. Every 
week it seems that people will 
… find a reason to critique us, 
about why we don’t deserve 
to be a top-ranked team,” said 
junior running back Karan 
Higdon. “Last week it was we 
don’t show up in big games. This 
week it’s Michigan State has 
the number one run defense.
“Blah, blah blah.”
Certainly, 
though 
Higdon 
may dismiss them, many of 
those 
questions 
have 
been 
warranted. Prior to this win, the 
best road win of the Harbaugh 
era was either 
the 32-23 win 
in East Lansing 
two years ago, 
against a team 
that 
would 
finish 
3-9, 
or 
a 
come-from-
behind win over 
Minnesota 
in 
2015. Neither of 
those approach 
this triumph.
Along the step-ladder that 
has been the last seven weeks, 
there has been appropriate 
skepticism.
It had to come against a 
ranked opponent. It had to 
come on the road. It had to 
come against a rival. 
Check. Check. Check.
And 
you 
know 
what, 
Michigan fans? It’s time to 
believe.
You can believe this team 
is different, that those scars 
unearthed in the week one loss 
to Notre Dame are healing.
After 
beating 
a 
ranked 
opponent for the first time 
since 2006, the first time in 
18 attempts to do so, you can 

believe that this program is 
turning 
a 
corner. 
Perhaps 
permanently.
And you can believe that 
Saturday marked a new chapter 
for Michigan in this rivalry. Or 
so Wolverines players would 
like you to believe.
Two 
hours 
before 
the 
game, both teams got started 
as you might expect. With 
Michigan on the field for pre-
game 
warmups, 
Michigan 
State started their “Spartan 
Walk,” in which the players 
link and walk across the field. 
When the Wolverine players 
wouldn’t 
move, 
fifth-year 
senior Lawrence Marshall was 
clotheslined 
by a Michigan 
State player.
Minutes 
later, 
junior 
linebacker 
Devin 
Bush 
walked toward 
the 
logo 
on 
the middle of 
the 
field 
and 
adamantly 
scuffed 
it 
up 
with his cleats.
After the game, fifth-year 
senior Chase Winovich, still 
unquestionably pumping with 
adrenaline, channeled his inner 
Mike Hart in 2007.
“We came in here. I openly, in 
the public, called it a ‘Revenge 
Tour.’ Called them out, said 
they’re next. We came in here, 
slashed their field before the 
game, and we still came out 
here and just got after them 
every single play.
“We knew that they couldn’t 
hang with us. We did what we 
had to do. Sometimes your 
little brother starts acting up, 
and you just gotta put them in 
place.”

Put aside for a moment 
whether this will be used as 
motivation for the foreseeable 
future (it will) or whether 
Winovich — off to the NFL next 
season — will have to deal with 
the repurcussions (he won’t). 
That was the exhalation of a 
decade’s worth of frustration, a 
privilege he and his teammates 
have now earned.
After the game, Harbaugh 
mentioned a quote he’d come 
across for this week, from 
Alonzo Mourning.
“Adversity introduces a man 
to himself.”
Saturday 
afternoon, 
Michigan faced adversity like it 
hadn’t since South Bend. There 
was every form of precipitation, 
fumbles galore, a road crowd, 
one 
giant 
mental 
hurdle 
weighing down the program.
And on the other end the 
Wolverines found out who they 
are: a team with legitimate 
post-season aspirations, and 
with the mental fortitude to get 
there.
None of this is to say this 
team is assured a Big Ten title 
or a College Football Playoff 
appearance. Penn State and 
Ohio State will surely have 
something to say about that. 
But it’s now safe to say this 
team is different.
As the yards continued to 
churn and the clock wilted 
away, as fans in green and 
white streamed for the exit and 
the chants of “Let’s go blue” 
steadily gained volume, that 
became abundantly clear.
And then the clouds cleared 
and sunshine peaked through.

Fifth-year senior defensive end Chase Winovich recorded four tackles against Michigan State in Michigan’s 21-7 win over the Spartans on Saturday.

“We knew 
that they 
couldn’t hang 
with us.”

Michigan tops OSU 
in overtime thriller

It was a goal 87 minutes in 
the making.
Both teams were exhausted 
heading into a second overtime, 
and a back-to-back Big Ten 
regular season title was on the 
line for Michigan.
The 
Wolverines’ 
break 
came 
with 
just 
over 
two 
minutes 
remaining 
in 
the 
second overtime. Sophomore 
midfielder Kayla Reed found 
herself alone along the baseline 
with the ball on 
her 
stick 
and 
the game in her 
hands. 
Reed 
carried 
the 
ball along the 
right 
baseline 
directly toward 
the 
goal 
and 
snuck it behind 
the keeper.
With 
the 
goal, the No. 7 
Wolverines (11-5 overall, 6-1 
Big Ten) successfully clawed 
their way to a double-overtime 
victory against No. 21 Ohio 
State (11-6, 4-3), and with it, 
another conference title. 
“I guess I was lucky enough 
to find myself along the baseline 
... tried to look for the pass but 
they’d cut them off,” Reed said. 
“I’d seen the goalie so I just 
popped it down and hoped for 
the best.”
The game began slowly, with 
both teams failing to score in the 
first half. Michigan dominated 
possession 
but 
struggled 
offensively. The Wolverines had 
the momentum at the first half’s 
end, but it quickly switched 
in favor of the Buckeyes at the 
start of the second frame. Ohio 
State tallied six shots and five 
penalty corners.

A string of three corners led 
to Buckeye midfielder Esther 
Clotet scoring off a low, hard 
shot to the corner. No more 
than ten minutes later, the 
Wolverines had an answer to 
Ohio State’s goal. Reed sent a 
hard shot toward the goal off 
a restart, and junior forward 
Meg Dowthwaite deflected the 
ball into the net from the right 
post.
It was not smooth sailing 
for 
Michigan 
heading 
into 
overtime with the game tied at 
one. The Wolverines competed 
with a player 
down for five 
minutes of the 
first ten-minute 
overtime period 
— the result of 
a yellow card 
to 
junior 
Fay 
Keijer 
in 
the 
65th minute of 
regular time.
“I mean it’s 
extraordinary 
to go through an overtime 
down a player and survive 
that,” said Michigan coach 
Marcia Pankratz. “Once we 
got our player back, I felt really 
confident 
that 
things 
were 
gonna go our way.”
With 
the 
defeat 
of 
the 
Buckeyes, Michigan finished 
the regular season 7-1 in the Big 
Ten, good enough for a share of 
the conference title with No. 
2 Maryland. The Wolverines 
finished the season 8-0 at home 
and will host the first round of 
the Big Ten Tournament next 
Sunday.
“I love playing home, it’s such 
a good experience,” Reed said. 
“Just a sense of pride, keeping 
a clean slate on your field. It’s 
always a good atmosphere, it’s 
really cool to have your friends 
in the stands, cheering you on.”

Special teams tell the story in series split 

Griffin Luce doesn’t score 
many goals.
The No. 11 Michigan hockey 
team’s junior defenseman had 
just two goals in 62 games 
played entering Friday night’s 
matchup against No. 19 Western 
Michigan (3-2). 
But on the power play in the 
third period, Luce received the 
puck from redshirt sophomore 
forward Luke Morgan in the 
right circle and fired a shot that 
found twine. Goaltender Trevor 
Gorsuch never saw the puck — 
not until it was going over his 
right shoulder into the net.
“(I) liked our power play,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Mel 
Pearson 
after 
Friday’s 
6-5 
victory. “(I) thought our power 
play obviously got us back in the 
game in the second period, got 
us the lead.”
The Broncos played a physical 
game, providing the Wolverines 
(1-2) with multiple power play 
opportunities. 
They 
were 
penalized eight times, including 
three times in the second 
period. Michigan converted on 
two of those chances, allowing 
the Wolverines to come back 
from a 3-1 deficit to tie the game.
In total, Michigan scored on 
three of its seven power plays 
— a conversion 
percentage 
of 
42.8 
percent, 
which 
would 
rank first in the 
nation 
if 
the 
Wolverines’ pace 
continued for the 
full season.
But 
Saturday 
night, Michigan’s 
power 
play 
struggled to find 
that same success as it fell, 5-4, 
to Western Michigan.
The Wolverines lit the lamp on 
only one of their eleven chances, 
and that one goal came from 
a rarely-utilized power play 
unit of senior forward Brendan 
Warren, junior forward Jake 
Slaker, junior defenseman Luke 
Martin, freshman defenseman 
Jack Summers and Morgan. 
Morgan’s shot was blocked by 

goaltender Austin Cain and 
Warren was able to tip in the 
rebound for his first goal of the 
season.
“I think we almost had too 
many power plays tonight,” 
Pearson said. “You get out of 
sorts and you’re continuing to 
play your top guys. Our only 
power play goal came from a 
group that we really haven’t 
worked 
with, 
and they go out 
there and just 
keep it simple 
and 
they 
get 
one.”
Just like the 
power 
play, 
Michigan’s 
penalty 
kill 
had an up-and-
down weekend. 
It was nearly 
perfect Friday, allowing just 
one goal on six chances for the 
Broncos.
On that one goal, Slaker and 
Martin let forward Ethen Frank 
slip behind them to stand just 
outside the right circle in the 
perfect spot to receive a pass 
across the ice from defenseman 
Corey Schueneman. Frank fired 
a wrist-shot that beat junior 
goaltender Hayden Lavigne and 

allowed Western Michigan to 
take the lead.
But the Wolverines’ penalty 
kill settled in after that, and the 
Broncos managed three shots 
on each of their three following 
power plays. Michigan’s penalty 
killers had five shorthanded 
shots on the night — the same 
number of power play shots they 
allowed Western Michigan.
In 
contrast, 
on 
Saturday, 
the Wolverines 
allowed 
the 
Broncos 
two 
goals 
on 
five 
opportunities, 
shooting 
themselves 
in 
the foot. Twice, 
a 
Michigan 
player 
was 
penalized while 
the Wolverines were already 
on the penalty kill, creating 
five-on-three 
chances 
for 
Western 
Michigan 
that 
it 
capitalized on.
“We can’t put ourselves five-
on-three,” Pearson said. “Like I 
told the team, both penalties we 
took to put us on five-on-three 
were slashing. And it’s not like 
we were preventing a goal, it 
was just a lazy penalty.

“Unfortunately, to start the 
third period, we had some 
momentum 
going 
into 
the 
period. We gave up that five-
on-three within two minutes 
of the third period. We just did 
not have a good start, we shot 
ourselves in the foot.”
With the pace and physicality 
of 
college 
hockey, 
special 
teams cannot be overlooked. 
An 
extra-man 
advantage 
opens up scoring 
opportunities 
that can make 
the 
difference 
between 
winning 
and 
losing. 
When 
both the power 
play and penalty 
kill succeed, a 
team has extra 
chances to recover from a 
deficit and pull itself back into 
contention.
But when special teams units 
struggle — like on Saturday, 
when 
Michigan 
scored 
on 
just one of eleven power play 
opportunities and allowed two 
goals while on the penalty kill — 
a win can become out of reach.
The Wolverines learned that 
the hard way this weekend.

Wolverines fall to Western Michigan despite opportunities

Shooting yourself in the foot is 
putting it lightly.
It’s easier to say after No. 11 
Michigan dropped its matchup 
against No. 19 Western Michigan, 
5-4, that it had shot itself in both.
On Saturday, the Wolverines 
simply weren’t careful enough. 
They let the Broncos strike early, 
and they let them strike hard, 
which put a lot of pressure on 
Michigan to respond. And while 
it did to an extent, the response 
just wasn’t enough to compensate 
for the sloppy performances 
given by the team.
“No question. We were loose 
with the puck,” said Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson. “Our puck 
management in the danger zone 
in our end was not good, it led 
directly to three of their goals 
tonight.”
Less than two minutes into 
the game, Western Michigan 
saw its first chance. Freshman 
goaltender 
Strauss 
Mann 
— 
while 
talented 
— 
was 
still 
inexperienced, 
having 
just 
started his first regulation game. 
After forcing a turnover in the 
Wolverines’ defensive zone, the 
Broncos had an odd-man attack 
in play, which they executed to 
perfection.
It was a textbook performance. 
Two players on both sides of the 
goaltender to divide his attention. 
Passes between the two to 
further the confusion. Though 
a Michigan player dropped back 
in time to contest one of the 
Western Michigan players, it 
wasn’t enough to allow Mann to 
commit himself to the other. A 
quick strike ensued and an early 
deficit followed.
But Michigan didn’t relent. 
The aggressive style of play of 
the Wolverines, often countering 
a Broncos’ push with one of 
their own, forced opportunities. 
Michigan just couldn’t capitalize.
In the first period, Michigan 
had 
six 
power 
plays. 
They 
converted zero of them. Western 

Michigan simply saw through 
the schemes, intercepting the 
passes or blocking the shot before 
it could even reach Broncos 
goaltender Austin Cain.
“They blocked a lot of shots 
tonight,” Pearson 
said. 
“They 
played with some 
urgency 
and 
some desperation 
and that threw 
us off a little bit. 
And that’s how it 
goes.”
It 
was 
only 
through a four-
on-four 
did 
Michigan 
find 
the answer to the early goal. 
Sophomore defenseman Quinn 
Hughes scored after a scramble 
in traffic behind the net pushed 
the puck towards him, near the 
blue line. With plenty of room to 
skate, he pushed forward and hit 

a straight-away shot in center-ice 
to tie the game, 1-1.
Discipline looked to be the 
deciding factor to controlling the 
first period. While the Wolverines 
received six penalties, they only 
committed three. 
It just happens 
that 
Western 
Michigan 
converted the one 
it needed. Bronco 
Hugh 
McGing 
had a clean shot 
from the center 
and 
took 
the 
opportunity 
given 
from 
a 
five-on-three 
situation to end the first period 
on a high note.
“We can’t put ourselves five-
on-three,” Pearson said. “Like I 
told the team, both penalties we 
took to put us on five-on-three 
were slashing. And it’s not like we 

were preventing a goal, it was just 
a lazy penalty. I call those lazy 
penalties, we have to get those 
out of our game.”
And the Broncos carried that 
momentum 
into 
the 
second 
period. 
Coming 
out fast, Western 
Michigan 
kept 
the 
offensive 
pressure on. With 
another turnover 
in the defensive 
zone, 
Michigan 
just 
couldn’t 
recover in time. 
The two-on-one 
situation, 
not 
unlike the first-
period turnover, ended in the 
same result — bringing the score 
further in favor of the Broncos, 
3-1.
As the period wound down, 
however, the Wolverines found 
the success they needed from 

the facets of the game they had 
struggled with prior in the match. 
Senior forward Brandon Warren 
converted the first power play 
goal for Michigan and soon after, 
with blazing speed, sophomore 
Josh Norris broke 
down ice and got 
the lead against 
two defenders.
With a flick 
into the five-hole, 
Norris tied the 
game 
at 
three 
apiece. 
It 
was 
the hustle and 
pace control the 
Wolverines 
had 
lacked all game 
that helped turn the tides in their 
favor.
And riding the momentum 
shift was junior center Nick 
Pastujov, who quickly followed 
suit scoring, this time off a 
rebound for Michigan’s first lead.

Scoring three straight, two 
in quick succession, can allow 
a team to dictate control of the 
game. Committing a penalty right 
before the period ends doesn’t.
The Wolverines wanted to 
capitalize on the scoring streak 
late in the second period. But it 
wasn’t possible with a five-on-
three disadvantage to start the 
third period.
“Unfortunately, to start the 
third period, we had some 
momentum, 
going 
into 
the 
period,” Pearson said. “We gave 
up that five-on-three within two 
minutes of the third period. We 
just did not have a good start. We 
shot ourselves in the foot.”
If there was any more proof, it 
came five minutes after Western 
Michigan scored the equalizer 
from the five-on-three at the 
start of the period. In a fast-
paced sequence where multiple 
shots were traded from both 
sides, Michigan attempted to 
clear the puck in its defensive 
zone. Lockwood got the puck and 
attempted to leave the zone, but 
lost control just as Bronco Josh 
Passolt cut from the blue line to 
the goal.
Watching the puck sail to the 
top right corner of the goal post, 
all Mann could do is shake his 
head defeatedly and slam his 
stick against the crossbar of the 
goal.
“Strauss did a good job,” 
Pearson said. “I thought he kept 
us in the game at times, I’m sure 
he’d like that fifth one back a little 
bit. He made some big saves, made 
them look easy, and obviously the 
five-on-threes were tough, he 
didn’t have a chance at those.”
It wasn’t Mann’s play that 
determined 
the 
game 
for 
Michigan. The Wolverines went 
one for 11 on the power play, 
notched three turnovers in the 
defensive zone that resulted 
in goals and had two five-on-
three situations, both in crucial 
moments. It couldn’t be more 
clear that while they lost to 
Western Michigan, they also lost 
to themselves.
