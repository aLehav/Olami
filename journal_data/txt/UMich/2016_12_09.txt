On 
a 
Thursday 
night 
in 

September, 
a 
LSA 
freshman 

named Hannah — who asked 
that only her first name be 
used because she is discussing 
underage drinking — had a few 
mixed drinks with her friends in 
her dorm room before going out. It 
was an 18+ night at BTB Cantina — 
a bar located on South University 
Avenue. At the time, Hannah was 
just old enough to get through the 
door. She was careful not drink at 
the bar — the bouncers had drawn 
X’s on her hands in Sharpie, 
indicating she was a minor and 
would not be served.

Hannah left BTB Cantina at 

about midnight but came back for 
her friend so she could walk her 
home. When she arrived back at 
the bar, her friend was speaking to 
a man in a T-shirt who appeared 
to be in his late 20s. Another man 
wearing a jersey approached her 
as well.

It took several minutes for 

Hannah to realize they were cops.

“(He) was like, ‘Have you been 

drinking?’ ” Hannah said in an 
interview last week. “And I had 
no idea who this guy was — I was 
extremely caught off guard; he 
didn’t have a badge or anything. I 
had no idea he was an undercover 
cop.”

She admitted to the man that 

she had been drinking, but only a 
little.

The 
Sexual 
Assault 

Prevention 
and 
Awareness 

Center’s 
Bystander 

Intervention and Community 
Engagement program, which 
hosts workshops to equip 
bystanders with the necessary 
skills to intervene, held a 
panel discussion about racism 
and safety at the University 
of Michigan Thursday night. 
The event aimed to serve 
as an open space to discuss 
the experience of students 
with marginalized identities 
following the divisive results 
of 
the 
2016 
election 
on 

campus.

The panel, which was open 

to all faculty, students and 
staff, as well as those not 
affiliated with the University, 
was attended by roughly 50 
students.

SAPAC 
volunteers 
and 

LSA 
seniors 
Nick 
Suarez 

and 
Jasmine 
Rubio, 
who 

organized the event, said 
they wanted to address the 
political issues unfolding on 
campus and educate students 
on possible constructive roles 
they can take moving forward.

“I’m hoping we get some 

solid ideas of how to be a 
proactive bystander and how 
to be a good ally,” Rubio said.

 Suarez agreed, adding, 

“I hope more than anything 
that 
this 
an 
educational 

experience.”

 The organizers pointed 

to a divided climate both on 
campus and across the nation 
as a catalyst for the event. 

 “It came because tensions 

have been so much higher, 
not necessarily because of a 
political outcome but because 
of a recent climate,” Suarez 
said. “We’ve been demanding 
a conversation and demanding 
people listen to our voices, 
but we haven’t had a place for 

students to speak unfiltered.”

The 
panel’s 
time 
was 

divided into a discussion about 
the experiences of minority 
students and their feelings 
toward the current campus 
climate, 
a 
conversation 

about the changes minority 
students would like to see and 
a segment allowing audience 
members to pose questions to 
the panel.

Six 
panelists, 
including 

undergraduates, 
graduate 

students and a recent graduate 
from different marginalized 
identities, spoke at the event. 
Panelists were first asked 
whether or not they feel safe 
on campus because of their 
respective identities.

“There’s 
different 
types 

of safety,” said LSA senior 
Alyssa Brandon, who is also 
a Michigan in Color editor 

Students, faculty, staff and the 

general public were invited to the 
University of Michigan College 
of Engineering Design Expo 
to hear students discuss their 
multidisciplinary design projects 
Thursday. 
Through 
these 

projects, students aim to develop 
solutions to real-life problems 
using collaborative, integrative 
approaches.

Organized 
by 
the 

Multidisciplinary 
Design 

Program, the biannual event, 
which 
spreads 
throughout 

several 
buildings 
on 
North 

Campus, includes a series of 
hands-on student presentation.

The MDP, which operates out 

of the College of Engineering, 
offers 
team-based 
projects 

to 
students 
University-wide. 

Several of the projects were 
part of the senior design project 
courses, and a handful were 
nonprofit or industry sponsored.

Payal 
Agarwal, 
MDP 

administrative 
assistant 
and 

expo organizer, said the event 
offers students an opportunity 
to present in front of an audience

University President Mark Schlissel oversees the Board of Regents meeting in the Michigan Union Thursday. 

In their last meeting of the 

calendar year, the University 
of Michigan Board of Regents 
discussed 
issues 
including 

construction, honorary degrees 

and campus climate in front 
of more than 50 attendees in 
the Michigan Union Thursday 
afternoon.

 
Renovations 
and 

construction projects

The 
Board 
of 
Regents 

unanimously approved multiple 
infrastructure projects at the 
meeting, 
including 
an 
$150 

million overhaul of the Ruthven 
Museums Building. As part of 
the renovations, the University’s 
central 
administration 

officials will move from their 
current offices in the Fleming 
Administration Building to the 
Ruthven Building. The Fleming 
Building — first opened in the 
1960s to popular student rumors 

about its “riot-proof” design — 
will eventually be demolished.

 Kevin Hegarty, chief financial 

officer 
and 
executive 
vice 

president 
of 
the 
University, 

announced the changes.

 “The project presents an 

exciting opportunity to preserve 
and reuse a landmark campus

The University of Michigan 

Board of Regents unanimously 
approved 
a 
new 
School 
of 

Environment and Sustainability, 
which will take the place of 
the current School of Natural 
Resources 
and 
Environment, 

at 
their 
December 
meeting 

Thursday afternoon. The new 
school is set to open on July 1, 
2017, and will be the first new 
school at the University in two 
decades. 

 In September, a research 

committee 
to 
examine 
the 

strengths and weaknesses of 
sustainability 
programs 
at 

the 
University 
recommended 

creating a new school to address 
pressing global challenges to 
the environment in their report. 
The committee consisted of 14 
different University faculty from 
10 different units and looked 
at the possibilities for growth 
within 
the 
SNRE, 
Graham 

Sustainability Institute and the 
Program in the Environment.

 Feedback was also gathered 

through meetings, town halls,

“Right then and there, he was 

like, ‘All right, blow,’ pulled out his 
badge, pulled out his Breathalyzer,” 
she said. “They just handled it so 
poorly. First of all, they didn’t ask 
me to blow, they told me to, which 
I found out is illegal — apparently I 
can refuse to blow.”

Hannah is right. Anyone can 

refuse a Breathalyzer, though 
refusal results in a fine.

The officer then took a picture 

of both girls on his cell phone, and 
once both were given a ticket for 
Minor in Possession, they were 
told to walk home, according to 
Hannah.

Over the past semester, multiple 

students have reported similar 
experiences to Hannah’s, with a 
range of concerns. 

According to Derrick Jackson, 

Washtenaw 
County 
director 

of 
community 
engagement, 

undercover cops have been a part 
of the county’s efforts to reduce 
underage drinking as part of the 
Washtenaw 
County 
Sheriff’s 

Department Office of Highway 
Safety Patrol.

A list of dates of targeted 

enforcement provided by Jackson 
include game days and holidays 
such as Halloween. All three of 
the students interviewed for this 
article said they received an MIP 
during one of the dates on Jackson’s 
list.

Jackson did not respond to 

further requests for comment 
about officer behavior at the time of 
publication.

Despite the stated intention 

of the OHSP to ensure minors 
are not illegally drinking alcohol, 
many students interviewed by 
The Michigan Daily said they feel 
the actions of these officers have 
been inappropriate and have led 
them to be wary and untrusting of 
law enforcement surrounding the 
University of Michigan campus.

“They were very disrespectful — 

it was clear that safety was not their 
first priority,” Hannah said. “They 
just wanted to hand out tickets.”

Because 
of 
this 
incident, 

Hannah said that was her first and 
last time at BTB Cantina.

The next day, Hannah contacted 

Student Legal Services, where she 
was told her she could either fight 
the charges against her or enter 
into the First Offender Program, a 
process specific to the 15th District 
Court in Ann Arbor that allows for 

prevention of a criminal record in 
the cases of first-offense MIPs if 
she complied with the rest of the 
program.

LSA freshman Quinn, who also 

asked to be identified by first name 
only, had similar experiences to 
Hannah. She has received two 
MIPs this school year.

The first football game day of the 

season, following a long morning 
of tailgating at fraternities, Quinn 
stumbled in the stadium and was 
approached by officers of DPSS. 
She was asked to blow into a 
Breathalyzer and was sent in an 
ambulance to the hospital, where 
she slept for a few hours.

Quinn also sought help from 

Student Legal Services, paid the 
$405 fine and attended BASICS 
— the mandatory Brief Alcohol 
Screening and Intervention for 
College Students alcohol awareness 
program that is part of the First 
Offender Program. She also had 
to meet with the Office of Student 
Conflict Resolution, as is mandated 
for alcohol-related incidents on 
campus, and was placed on six 
months of non-reporting probation, 
which does not require in-person 
follow-ups with probation officers.

Until one night, at the end of 

October when she left Study Hall 
Lounge — a bar on South University 
Avenue — and three people pulled 
her and her friends aside.

“They were like, ‘Yeah, we were 

going to give an MIP to the next 
people that walked by here, so I 
guess you’re the unlucky ones,’ 
” Quinn said. “(But they said) 
‘If you blow below a 0.1 (on the 
Breathalyzer), we’re just going to 
let you go.’ ”

One of Quinn’s friends had a 

blood alcohol content of 0.09, and 
was allowed to leave. Quinn and her 
friend had blood alcohol contents 
of 0.12 and 0.14, respectively, and 
both were given MIPs.

“I shouldn’t have blown, but 

they know how to coerce you 
into it,” Quinn said, expressing 
concern about how the undercover 
officers “aggressively” handled the 
situation. “They took our phones 
out of our hands and took our fake 
IDs out of the back.”

Quinn said she found DPSS 

acted much more professionally in 
her first incident.

building,” he said. “The condition 
of the Fleming building is one of 
the worst on this campus … the 
building continues to deteriorate 
and now requires an annual 
inspection to ensure its safety.”

 Faculty and staff currently 

working in the Ruthven Building 
will move to the planned Biological 
Sciences Building, which is slated 
to be completed in the summer 
of 2018. The Ruthven project will 
also add 100,000 square feet for 
learning classrooms.

 
During 
discussion 
about 

the renovation, Regent Mark 
Bernstein (D) voiced concerns 
about preserving the legacy of 
the Fleming Building’s namesake, 
former 
University 
president 

Robben Fleming.

 University President Mark 

Schlissel affirmed that Fleming’s 
contributions 
would 
not 
be 

forgotten.

 
“We 
are 
committed 
to 

continuing to honor President 
Fleming, one of my personal 
heroes at Michigan,” he said. “We 
will figure this out in the months 
and years to come.”

 The regents also approved 

a schematic design for the new 
Trotter 
Multicultural 
Center 

location 
on 
Central 
Campus. 

After 
multiple 
forums, 
town 

halls and surveys of students, 
faculty and staff, the $10 million 
construction project is scheduled 
to be completed in the fall of 2018. 
Many residents of nearby Helen 
Newberry and Betsy Barbour 
Residence Halls have expressed 
hesitation about the new center’s 
location on the buildings’ lawns.

 During the meeting, Jane 

Wright, president of the Hanbury 
design firm, presented the design 
and she said took “everyone’s 
needs” into account.

 “The plans were greatly 

informed by student voice,” she 
said. “Collectively those voices 
brought together what mattered 
most.”

 
The 
design 
features 

multipurpose rooms and rooms 
configured for active learning that 
will fit around 100 students.

 Regent Larry Deitch (D) hailed 

the project’s progress, but also 
suggested 
changing 
Trotter’s 

unique status as the only building 
on campus named after a person 
of color.

 “I would suggest in the next 

year or two, try to figure out how 
to remedy that,” he said. “Even if 
that means the quaint notion of 
naming something after somebody 
who was high-achieving, and who 
didn’t just write a big check.” 

 Renovations to the the Law 

Quad exterior, scheduled for next 
summer, were also approved. 
The project includes $6.2 million 
in improvements to sidewalks, 
lighting 
and 
underground 

utilities.

 
Additionally, 
the 
regents 

approved additional funds for 
a 
large-scale 
renovation 
of 

the North Campus Recreation 
Building. The original proposal 
passed by the regents last March 
had a budget of $13 million, but the 

newest iteration boosts funding to 
$17.4 million. The new building’s 
features include improved athletic 
facilities 
and 
gender-inclusive 

and 
accessible 
locker 
rooms 

complying with the Americans 
with Disabilities Act.

 Justice Sonia Sotomayor
 University President Mark 

Schlissel announced U.S. Supreme 
Court Justice Sotomayor will 
receive 
an 
honorary 
degree 

from 
the 
University 
during 

her appearance at a campus 
bicentennial 
colloquium 
next 

January. 
Sotomayor 
will 

participate 
in 
a 
moderated 

discussion with Justice Susanne 
Baer of the Federal Constitutional 
Court of Germany on the “Future 
University Community.”

 Justice Baer received a law 

degree 
from 
the 
University 

in 1993. Four other honorary 
degrees are being given at Winter 
Commencement on Dec. 18.

 CSG and undocumented 

students

 During his monthly speech 

to the board, David Schafer, 
president 
of 
Central 
Student 

Government and an LSA senior, 
addressed 
the 
recent 
ethnic 

intimidation incidents on campus.

 “There is no denying that the 

last month has been a difficult one 
for our students,” Schafer said. 
“Some have expressed to me that 
they are afraid to walk home at 
night.”

 He encouraged administration 

and faculty to not ignore these 
feelings of students and stand in 
solidarity, also encouraging the 
community at large to practice 
diversity, equity and inclusion.

 “This is not a partisan issue, 

this is a University of Michigan 
issue.” Schafer said. “Because 
when anyone is targeted or made 
to feel unsafe of unwelcome on 
our campus, that must matter to 
all of us.”

 
Schafer thanked President 

Schlissel for releasing a statement 
in support of the continuation of 
the Deferred Action for Childhood 
Arrivals 
Act, 
which 
allows 

undocumented immigrants who 
arrived as children to qualify for 
deferred deportations and work 
permits 

 
Schlissel also joined more than 

500 other colleges and universities 
in co-signing a letter last month 
urging the federal government to 
continue DACA protections. Schafer 
also noted that CSG had recently 
passed a resolution supporting the 
executive order.

 “At our most recent CSG meeting 

on Tuesday we passed a resolution 
that will join you in supporting the 
continuation of DACA and reaffirms 
support 
for 
undocumented 

students,” 
Schaefer 
said. 
“We 

look forward to working with you 
and the rest of our University in 
ensuring the protection of these 
most invaluable and cherished 
students.”

 After Schafer’s remarks, Schlissel 

echoed his sentiments about the 
importance 
of 
undocumented 

students at the University.

 “Their presence enriches this 

University community,” Schlissel 
said.

and receive constructive input 
from attendees that will help 
them moving forward.

“These students work really 

hard the entire year on their 
projects and frankly if I work 
hard on something, I want to 
show it off,” she said. “This is 
a platform for them to do that. 
They definitely get the feedback 
from visitors. They can learn 
how to talk to people.”

Engineering senior Kaitlyn 

Holmstrom was a member of a 
20-person team that aimed to 
collect more accurate data on 
the planetary boundary layer, 
also called the atmospheric 
boundary 
layer. 
The 
team 

developed small drones that, 
like maple seeds, spin as they fall 
to the ground. The drones have 
four wings and a circuit board 
in the center with sensors that 
record atmospheric data, such 
as wind speed and pressure.

Holmstrom said one of the 

goals of the expo is for the group 
to get feedback from the public.

“We work on this, and it’s just 

us 20 people who know about it,” 
she said. “Then you get hundreds 
of people coming through. You 
get to gauge, is this an important 
project or not? What does the 
public think?”

She said as a result of 

working with other engineering 
disciplines, she gained a different 
perspective on the project. 

“I’m a mechanical engineer,” 

Holmstrom 
said. 
“In 
class 

projects, I work with other 
mechanical engineers. On this, 
there’s 
computer 
engineers, 

computer software, people from 
aerospace, so a bunch of different 
disciplines. It’s cool to see how 
their parts affect our parts and 
learn more about what they do. 
I think that strengthens my 
career as an engineer because 
when I get out into industry, I’ll 
know more about what that team 
does.”

Engineering 
senior 
Adam 

Vignaroli worked with a team to 
help design a plant that produces 
the herbicide dicamba, because 
certain weeds are resistant 
to 
traditional 
glyphosate 

herbicides. He said he felt that 
it was important to present his 
team’s work because dicamba 
will soon be widely used.

“We’re expanding the ideas 

to the people,” Vignaroli said. 
“We’re 
spreading 
knowledge 

so that people know. This 
herbicide was approved by the 
(Environmental 
Protection 

Agency) about a month ago. 
So this a pretty new thing for 
agriculture use. It’s going to be 
expanding pretty dramatically 
over the next couple of years.”

Another

was tasked with improving the 
process by which runways at the 
Detroit Metropolitan Airport 
are inspected.

surveys and other tools from 
students, faculty and staff about 
sustainability at the University. 
Earlier in October, a new school 
faculty team was appointed 
to help transition the School 
of 
Natural 
Resources 
and 

Environment to the new school.

 University Provost Martha 

Pollack, who originally requested 
the research report concerning 
the University’s sustainability 
programs, said in an October 
interview 
that 
the 
impetus 

behind the idea was to spur 
innovation in the area.

 “The idea of the new school 

is to think of new ways to bring 
these people together, new ways 
to involve students, really whole 
new ways to do education and 
research in this topic,” she said.

 The school was approved at 

Pollack’s final Board of Regents 
meeting 
as 
provost 
at 
the 

University. Last month, Cornell 
University appointed Pollack as 
president following the death 
of Cornell president Elizabeth 
Garrett. Pollack will begin at 
Cornell on April 17, 2017, but will 
step down from her University 
position several months before 
that. 

 According to the action 

request, the new school will 
still include faculty from the 
SNRE and will aim to build on 
the school’s strengths. It will be 
designed to encourage cross-
University faculty collaboration 

in a faculty and staff structure the 
request described as “porous.”

 
University 
President 

Mark Schlissel first officially 
introduced

and 
emphasized 

broader

between 
relevant

programs 
and

interview last week Schlissel 
confirmed that work on the 
new school would still continue

“There’s 
physical 

safety. There’s mental and 
emotional safety. Even before 
this 
election, 
people 
of 

color had to strategize their 
existence. What I mean by 
strategize 
their 
existence 

is when you’re going into 
classrooms and meetings, but 
it’s more like a battleground … 
The current political climate 
has normalized a lot of those 
behaviors that target people of 
color.”

Jonté 
Jones, 
a 
recent 

graduate of the Department 
of Biopsychology, detailed the 
frustration he felt in the face of 
racism in Ann Arbor, recalling 
a night walking downtown 
while he was still a student 
at the University. On his way 
home, several men in a pickup 
truck drove by Jones and yelled 
racial slurs at him, he said.

“This is supposed to be a 

safe place for people; this is 
not a place where this kind of 
thing happens,” Jones said. 
“After the election, it became 
very normalized. It does feel 
like a very unsafe area.”

LSA senior Misba Saleem 

drew the connections between 
safety, religion and a recent 
hate 
crime 
perpetrated 

against a Muslim woman after 
the election, referring to an 
incident last month where a 
man threatened to set a female 
student on fire if she did not 
take off her hijab. Saleem 
highlighted the intersection 
of gender and religion, as well 
as the emotional and spiritual 
ramifications of a woman being 
forced to remove her hijab.

“It’s a part of you,” Saleem 

said. “It’d be like someone 
forcing you to take off your 

clothes. 
It’s 
very 
much 
a 

gender-based violence. For a 
woman to be forced to take 
off her hijab is to be forced to 
expose yourself. There’s an 
intersection there that isn’t 
often identified.”

The panelists also discussed 

the ways in which the 2016 
election has changed the way 
they view racism in America. 
Overall, the panel agreed that 

racism has not become more 
prevalent, but rather racist 
behavior 
is 
getting 
more 

attention 
and 
recognition 

because of social media.

They also considered how 

they 
are 
treated 
in 
their 

everyday lives and what they 
would like to change about 
their interactions.

 “I think the most offensive 

thing is being tokenized by 
my white friends who want to 
be an ally,” Brandon said. “I 
would challenge you to think. 
Are you having your friends 
who are people of color around 
to show that you are woke? 
Are you using your friends 
who are people of color to give 
you diversity answers? These 
behaviors are offensive and 
they may come from a good 
place but they’re also harmful. 
For this audience, I would 
challenge you to think about 
that.” 

LSA 
senior 
Sabrina 

Bilimoria, 
who 
is 
also 
a 

Michigan in Color editor at 
The Michigan Daily, addressed 
these issues at the institutional 
level, 
examining 
how 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan 

administration has chosen to 
consider diversity on a wider 
scale. She pointed in particular 
to the Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion plan, a long-term 
strategic plan launched by 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel earlier this year that 
aims 
to 
increase 
diversity 

and improve campus climate 
through a series of initiatives. 
It 
is 
benchmarked 
to 
be 

completed in 2021.

“The DEI initiatives are 

bullshit,” 
Bilimoria 
said. 

“You’re asking all the students 
of color to educate on something 
that’s happening in five years. 
So we should do all the work 
for you? Very little is done on 
an institutional level. There’s 
such a lack of understanding 
from Schlissel and many, many 
administrators as to a common 
way to talk to students without 
without tokenizing them and 
asking minority students to do 
all the work.”

 Bilimoria’s comments were 

met with applause from the 
audience.

Rackham student Veronica 

Varela emphasized to the 
crowd that she would prefer 
friends and allies to get out 
from behind computer screens 
and 
take 
tangible 
action 

to 
support 
marginalized 

identities.

 “Stop asking how I feel,” 

Varela said. “Just reach out. I 
know people who will share 
all kinds of things all over 
Facebook, but when it comes 
to in-person, I never see them. 
Stop being just a Facebook 
warrior. 
Be 
an 
in-person 

warrior.”

I

’m not sure if any word has 
been used as frequently as 
“populism” in regard to politics 

this year. Politicians, experts, media 
outlets and everyone in between hasve 
been using “populism” to describe 
the recent and frequently 
unnerving 
political 

volatility 
around 
the 

world. I know the Oxford 
Dictionary has already 
chosen “post-truth” as 
its word of the year, but 
I think “populism” is a 
worthy runner-up.

The 
United 
States 

just recently had a taste 
of its own populism. 
You have most likely 
seen the word thrown around in the 
news as many have been quick to label 
Presidential-elect 
Donald 
Trump’s 

triumph as a continuation of the populist 
wave that has stormed through other 
Western democracies, but what does 
it actually mean?

“Populism” comes from the Latin 

word for “people” and at its core 
is a political ideology promoting a 
government for and by ordinary 
people as opposed to elitists. Populism 
began in the late 1800s as a revolt by 
farmers in Middle America. It was an 
effort to call out the blatant neglect by 
both the Democratic and Republican 
Parties of the time and rally against 
the establishment government. Since 
then, populism has seen its rise and 
fall throughout political history in 
both the United States and the world 
as a whole. As The Economist notes, 
populism takes on different forms but 
is always “united in pitting the people 
against the powerful.” 

Populist movements are often 

driven by charismatic leaders with a 

knack for appealing to working class 
people who, like the farmers of the 
1800s, see neglect in the status quo. 
You probably learned and quickly 
forgot about William Jennings Bryan 
and the Populist movement in your 

U.S. history class. Yet, 
just as history is bound to 
repeat itself, if you take a 
look at political systems 
around the world, you’ll 
see a modern brand of 
populism on the rise.

These 
recent 

movements 
address 

economic reforms but, 
unlike their 19th-century 
counterparts, encompass 
reactions 
to 
cultural 

changes. Populism is both a left- and 
right-wing phenomenon with some 
sects promoting xenophobic and 
nationalistic policies and others taking 
on a more progressive approach. The 
New York Times created a telling 
infographic that highlights the many 
platform overlaps in the growing 
populist movements, all of which 
begin 
with 
“anti-:” 
anti-austerity, 

anti-globalization, anti-eurozone, anti-
immigration and so on. However, this 
isn’t to say that all populist groups are 
inherently xenophobic or ethnocentric, 
but they all are working to upend the 
political status quo, thus the “anti.” 
 

Just this week, Italy’s prime minister, 

Matteo Renzi, announced his plans 
to resign. After 60 percent of Italians 
voted to reject constitutional reforms, 
Renzi admitted defeat and resigned. 
This marks another European shift to 
populism and an opportunity for Renzi’s 
opponents, led by the populist Five Star 
Movement, to take advantage of the 
vacancy. The resignation by no means 
ensures the establishment of a populist 

government in Italy, but it is a victory 
for the movement nonetheless. As Five 
Star member Manlio Di Stefano told the 
Washington Post, “This is something 
that is going on all over Europe, if you 
look at the momentum … Every term is 
the same, every government is the same, 
so people are reacting.”

Donald Trump’s shocking victory 

was a result of similar populist 
sentiments felt by Americans. You 
have probably heard all the rationales 
and explanations for his victory, many 
of which emphasize his play on the 
populist ideals of many Americans. 
With the rapid globalization of this 
century resulting in diverse populations 
— new industries and a more connected 
and open international community 
— populism represents a movement 
to close some of those doors and push 
countries to look inward.

Yet, Donald Trump’s victory 

shouldn’t have been as surprising as 
it was. While Americans had never 
experienced a Trump-esque victory, 
other countries have seen many like it. 
All over the world and eerily popular 
in the West, anti-establishment 
movements and political outsiders 
have been brought to the forefront. 
The Brexit vote of last summer, the 
rise of Germany’s Alternative Party, 
Podemos in Spain and National Front 
in France were all sure warning signs 
that the status quo is changing. In fact, 
after Trump’s victory, many populist 
leaders praised the president-elect.

Populism is also not attributed 

to one group of people. Instead, it 
appeals to varying demographics. 
Trump’s support was drawn from 
all 
different 
American 
realms, 

and he was strategic in playing on 
populist sentiments, especially the 
dissatisfaction of Americans with their 

government. But similar sentiments 
had already been on the rise in Europe. 
It’s not so often that political systems 
around the world have commonalities. 
Demographics and sheer experience 
create strikingly different political 
environments between countries. Yet, 
it seems like many countries are making 
a shift toward populism. Citizens are 
pushing for politics to focus internally 
as their countries have been looking 
outward for the past decade.

So, what does this all mean? 

For liberal-minded folk, populism, 
especially in a xenophobic form, doesn’t 
sit well. In the United States, liberals and 
moderates have been trying to analyze 
Trump supporters and understand the 
“why” behind their votes. However, the 
international rise of a modern populism 
is a visible sign of dissatisfaction and 
uncertainty. People are tired of our 
current political norms and are pushing 
for an altered status quo.

Populism may just be a fad — an 

aberration to the norm of politics. As 
shocking as it is, it also follows a trend 
in human history. No country, no 
matter how much liberals hope and 
pray, stays on the progressive track 
for too long. The United States has 
been good at taking two steps forward 
and one step back, moving forward 
nonetheless, but not continuously. 
Change is scary; it is threatening. 
The changes of the 21st century in 
both economic and cultural contexts 
have been felt around the world, and 
populism is a human reaction to it. 
So even if populist movements never 
make it to their nation’s highest office, 
they have been seen and they have 
been heard.

A modern rise in populism

I

n one of my classes this 
semester, we were told 
to 
repurpose 
a 
paper 

we had written in a previous 
course. The one I selected was 
a short research paper about 
the unique divisiveness of 
climate change in the United 
States. As someone with no 
background in science, I felt 
that I couldn’t reconstruct an 
entirely new paper about that 
topic and looked elsewhere for 
something still pertinent to 
the framing of climate change.

It 
doesn’t 
take 
much 

research to know that there 
is an array of different outlets 
that Americans turn to for 
their news, and many of those 
outlets maintain a distinct 
narrative. I couldn’t help but 
wonder: Has the media always 
looked this way? Given the 
fiasco of this election cycle 
and the role news broadcasters 
play 
in 
prioritizing 
which 

issues the public is concerned 
with, I found myself delving 
into the history of the U.S. 
media, and one particular 
aspect of this evolution caught 
my eye: the rapid polarization 
of our country’s media.

In 
1949, 
the 
Federal 

Communications Commission 
identified what it perceived 
as a major flaw in the media 
landscape of the time: Three 
networks — ABC, NBC and 
CBS — held near full control 
over nationwide broadcasting. 
In order to prevent bias, which 
many viewed as an eventual 
inevitability, 
the 
Fairness 

Doctrine was enacted. It stated 
that for any contemporary 
issues of public importance, 
these networks (and any other 
licensed broadcasters) must 
present a balanced perspective 
to their viewers, addressing 
both 
sides 
of 
contentious 

topics. 

For the better part of four 

decades, this policy was crucial 
in 
preventing 
unfettered, 

uncontested 
criticism 
or 

support of people and ideas 
in the news and kept the most 
powerful sources of news in 
the United States from falling 
into the problematic biased 
coverage tendency. Its repeal 
in 1987 was driven by the rising 
notion that such a mandate was 
a violation of free speech and a 
government infringement on 
the expression of ideas.

The heart of the debate 

surrounding 
the 
Fairness 

Doctrine, both up to and 
since its repeal, has been 
whether 
the 
regulation 
of 

licensed broadcasters would 
“enhance” or “reduce” the 
public discourse — a struggle 

between enforced objectivity 
being in the public interest or 
a violation of First Amendment 
rights. 
The 
question 
then 

remains: Has the degree to 
which 
broadcasters 
inform 

the 
U.S. 
public 
increased 

or 
decreased 
since 
the 

elimination of this doctrine?

The most recent efforts to 

revive the Fairness Doctrine 
have — as shown by the 
individuals who’ve resurfaced 
it 
— 
undoubtedly 
been 
a 

response to the emergence of 
conservative talk radio in the 
past two decades. Despite the 
conspicuousness of this fact, 
one shouldn’t discard these 
efforts as partisan squabbling. 
The Fairness Doctrine was, in 
its conception and subsequent 
defenses, 
a 
bipartisan 

effort 
to 
prevent 
licensed 

broadcasters from propagating 
and capitalizing on the very 
narratives 
that 
have 
now 

reached extensive audiences. 
Regardless of where one stands 
on 
the 
Fairness 
Doctrine, 

it is undeniable that now-
prominent broadcasters have 
upheld a distinct perspective 
of the country we live in.

Through both observation 

and research, I’ve become 
convinced that the direction 
in which a substantial segment 
of the modern U.S. media 
has evolved is detrimental 
to our civil discourse and, 
consequently, to the public 
interest. 
A 
once-marginal 

narrative wherein our country 
is 
constantly 
jeopardized 

or under attack by a violent 
religion, criminal migrants, 
the parasitic poor, delusional 
environmentalists 
and 
a 

duplicitous left-wing media 
has 
become 
normalized 

and helped to galvanize an 
electorate that was justifiably 
disillusioned (albeit due to 
different actualities).

The 
response 
by 
the 

powerful 
broadcasting 

conglomerates has not been 
to defend their legitimacy and 
denounce views unsupported 
by fact. They have instead 
exhibited 
such 
stances 
as 

a legitimate counterpart to 
the modern conservative and 
liberal platforms. At the same 
time, these multimedia powers 
have paired an inability to 
provide much-needed clarity 
with a dilution of content.

Given the option between a 

steady flow of curated opinions 
or pure entertainment, it’s 
no surprise that many people 
have chosen the latter. Those 
who do choose to pursue 
informative content are now 
faced with outlets that only 

seek to further entrench them 
in whatever partisan leaning 
they’re already predisposed to. 
The alignment of once-reliable 
media sources with political 
factions and more lucrative 
entertainment 
platforms 

has devastated investigative 
journalism and helped to halt 
constructive discourse. 

The result has been nuanced 

issues 
becoming 
distinctly 

two-sided struggles. On one 
end, the urgency of climate 
change is simply a part of 
the 
“alarmist” 
narrative. 

Legislation 
to 
keep 
high-

capacity guns out of the hands 
of 
unvetted 
or 
potentially 

dangerous individuals is a 
liberal infringement upon all 
of our rights. Police brutality 
and the larger inequities it 
points to can be unilaterally 
disproved by the folly of Colin 
Kaepernick. At the same time, 
those aligned with an opposing 
narrative might be convinced 
that anyone involved in the 
natural gas industry is evil, 
anyone who owns a gun is crazy 
and cops are predominantly 
malicious. Both perspectives 
are destructive to the dialogue 
in this country, yet each has 
been augmented by media and 
political frameworks that too 
often benefit from keeping 
the truth (which usually falls 
somewhere in the middle) 
opaque.

By fortifying two distinct, 

simplified sides of complex 
issues, we have become almost 
willfully ignorant. In a country 
that 
has 
progressed 
for 

centuries through discourse 
and compromise, the solutions 
to our problems will continue 
to elude us until a willingness 
for ideological coexistence and 
cooperation returns. 

Reinvigorating 
a 
truly 

informative 
media 
is, 
in 

my eyes, the best place to 
start. Whether such change 
should be rooted in a revival 
of 
investigative 
journalism, 

media-ownership 
caps, 

more 
conspicuous 
public 

broadcasting, 
network 

neutrality 
or 
“fairness” 

legislation of some kind is a 
discussion for experts to have. 
But to a novice like myself, one 
thing couldn’t be clearer: Until 
those charged with informing 
us return to valuing objectivity 
over the narrative they want to 
convey, we will never mend the 
ever-widening divide that has 
gradually suppressed our great 
country.

A broken media

I

’ve been a columnist for three 
semesters, expounding upon 
nearly 
every 
substantive 

opinion I’ve had over that time and 
putting it to words. It has made 
me challenge every thought and 
better articulate why I believe in the 
causes that I support, and 
sometimes, want to fight 
for. I’m sure many others 
have felt the same way 
— having to voice their 
opinions in the face of 
opposition and having 
to keep pushing until 
the change what they’re 
looking for is enacted. 
But at the same time, 
writing and talking and 
thinking about things 
over and over can be exhausting. 
I’ve been asked to talk more 
extensively about my opinions 
with little impetus to do so.

Nevertheless, 
both 
words 

and actions supporting various 
convictions have proven to be 
monumental in history. Take the 
protesters against the Dakota 
Access 
Pipeline, for example. 

Many people — including those 
potentially affected and others 
coming from outside the tribe 
— rallied to make a difference in 
order to reroute the pipeline. They 
recently achieved their goal, but 
I’m sure that the protestors felt 
dejected, hopeless and just plain 
tired. It takes a tireless effort to 
do great things in this world, and 
determination 
similar 
to 
this 

must be adopted by those who are 
passionate about a cause.

Situations can be as dire as the 

DAPL situation or as simple as 
standing up for a friend. I’m still 
inspired by the nonviolent protests 
of Martin Luther King Jr. in the 
civil rights movement. King could 
have given up or felt like he was 
fighting a losing battle when he was 
in jail, in the hospital or marching in 

the streets. But he and many other 
leaders and freedom fighters around 
him never lost hope and kept going, 
always persisting in order to make a 
change that would impact the world 
in an astounding way.

Whatever the situation is, we 

cannot 
be 
silent 

in fighting for our 
beliefs. 
We 
must 

make a choice to keep 
fighting amid fatigue. 
Too 
many 
others 

across the world have 
lost their lives or been 
hurt while protesting 
for their inalienable 
rights. We’re lucky 
to live in a country 
where 
change 
is 

possible even if ordinary citizens 
are leading the charge.

In one of my classes, we watched 

videos of the protests of the Arab 
Spring in Egypt, seeing thousands 
of people congregate in Tahrir 
Square. The unity of the people 
there was a spectacle of beauty. The 
president they opposed resigned as 
a result of the protests, but many of 
those protesters either ended up 
missing or were martyrs for their 
cause. These people didn’t have 
time to be tired because their lives 
were on the line. Their time was 
only the present.

Situations can be less dire in the 

United States. But crises such as 
the Flint water crisis are scenarios 
in which people must keep fighting 
to receive what we would think is 
a basic need: water. Sadly, many 
areas in my hometown still don’t 
have clean water. Babies continue 
to scream, and mothers have to 
remind the world that help is 
still needed. Many news stations 
have come and gone, tired of 
reporting on the same coverage. 
I’ve written many papers on this 
topic, donated time, read countless 
articles, given money to this cause 

and become increasingly fatigued 
from the constant coverage. I only 
felt that way because my home 
wasn’t directly affected; I can’t 
imagine how hard I would fight 
if it was. While people lose sleep 
over making their voices heard and 
going through their now-altered 
routines, the lead-ridden pipes stop 
running a block from my house.

Whatever the topic may be, we 

must attempt to adopt complete 
empathy for those who are directly 
affected by any injustice. If we want 
something to change, we must act as 
if something wrong is happening 
to us or to someone we love. It is 
worth it to fight through feeling 
exhuasted 
and 
conversations 

about important issues that sound 
like broken records. Love alone is 
worth the fight.

It’s completely OK to be tired 

of talking about President-elect 
Donald Trump and related issues, 
for example, but that shouldn’t 
lead to an end to discussion. 
Perhaps the fact that conversations 
about 
certain 
topics 
become 

exhaustive is good because it 
allows for breaks, giving people 
the opportunity to pause and 
think. This way, ideas can be more 
nuanced and developed, setting 
the groundwork for substantive 
conversation later on. Breaks from 
debate and thinking are needed as 
well, because we wouldn’t be able 
to function properly if we spent all 
our time focusing on a single issue. 
Nonetheless, we must come back 
quickly in dire situations because 
there are people out there such as 
the DAPL protesters who have to 
spend all their time fighting — it’s 
their well-being on the line.

So whatever it is that you are 

passionate about, fight for it with 
as much energy as you can give out.

Friday, December 9, 2016 — 5

At the end of my penultimate 

semester at the University of 
Michigan, and in the final days 
of my editing career at The Daily, 
I’ve found myself turning to songs 
that I used to hate — the kind of 
tearjerking, stereotypical goodbye 
songs that always seem tailormade 
for these moments in life so that 
anybody who even mildly connects 
with the sentiment can feel 
understood. I’m not proud.

The 
tune 
I’m 
particularly 

focused on is one of the most 
cliché songs I can think of, an out-
of-character two-minute ballad 
from 
America’s 
most 
famous 

punk band that has probably 
soundtracked a million graduation 
slideshows. “Good Riddance (Time 
of Your Life),” if you don’t have an 
immediate visceral reaction to 
its iconic opening guitar notes, is 
actually a pretty great composition.

“Good 
Riddance” 
is 
an 

extraordinary simple yet brilliantly 
efficient megahit, a no-frills punk 
song that just happens to be played 
on acoustic instead of electric 
guitar, with a quickly recorded 
string section thrown in for radio. 
Billie Joe Armstrong’s lyrics are 
intended to be sarcastic, as the 
narrator basically tells his ex to hit 
the road, because it’s over and you 
have to move on — his “I hope you 
had the time of your life” chorus is 
supposed to be a biting riff on the 
famous song from “Dirty Dancing.”

“Good Riddance” soon became 

the song that defined Green Day. It 
played over a scene in “Seinfeld” ’s 
final season, which probably more 
than anything is what catapulted 
it into the public consciousness. 
After it was seen by millions on 
TV, the song became a hit at proms 
and graduations, understandably 

losing its edge as kids and adults 
alike took Billie Joe’s words at face 
value and interpreted the song as a 
nostalgic, sort of “Auld Lang Syne”-
esque jam (in the public’s defense, 
Billie Joe doesn’t actually sound 
especially sarcastic as he sings — 
“For what it’s worth, it was worth 
all the while” is a decently sweet 
thing to sing).

This exposure turned “Good 

Riddance” into the worst thing 
a song could be in the eyes of the 
public: sentimental. Quote-unquote 
“real” Green Day fans didn’t like 
the people who only knew the 
band’s biggest, least representative 
song, and even among the general 
public, the song hit that saturation 
point where any use of it anywhere 
felt totally unoriginal, greeted by 
eye-rolls and sighs. It turned into 
“Over the Rainbow” or “What 
a Wonderful World” or, more 
recently, “Hallelujah.”

But, in a moment of maybe 

weakness or nostalgia or just a 
desire to connect with music on 
an emotional level, I looked up 
“Good Riddance,” listened and 
really 
enjoyed 
it. 
Admittedly, 

I’m a bigger fan of the alternate, 
demo version that ended up as the 
B-side to “Brain Stew,” with its 
faster, strummed guitar, stringless 
arrangement and lack of that self-
conscious false start intro.

But either version showcases 

Armstrong’s 
strength 
as 
a 

songwriter, emphasizing his ability 
to make a point in the most efficient 
and catchiest way possible. If it 
were played at the volume of, say, 
“Basket Case,” “Good Riddance” 
would likely be an uncontroversial 
top tier Green Day hit among its 
fanbase, with its harder sound 
keeping it out of TV and high 
schools’ reach.

I think it helps the song’s 

reputation, too, that Green Day 
is no longer “the band that sings 

‘Time of Your Life.’ ” They’ve 
been lucky and talented enough to 
have an incredible second wind as 
artists, and now they’ve gained a 
wider audience and deeper catalog 
of good songs than they ever did 
in the ’90s. “Good Riddance” is no 
longer the song that misrepresents 
Green 
Day, 
but 
rather 
one 

composition in a deep arsenal of 
punk and arena rock. They can pull 
it out for the encore sing-along if 
they want, but at this point, with 
all the band’s other hits, they’re not 
even obligated to play it.

I get that “Good Riddance” is an 

easy song to get sick of, and if you 
heard it constantly from the late 
’90s into the 2000s I completely 
understand why you’d never want 
to hear it again. It’s repetitive, 
simple and seems to have a 
cloyingly lame message (“the past 
was good!”). I’m totally fine with 
the moratorium we seemed to be 
placed on the song in pop culture, 
but if it makes some kind of “Don’t 
Stop Believin’ ”-type resurgence 
after being used ironically in a 
prestige TV show (or even just 
something zeitgeisty and young), 
I think that would be a well-
deserved fate.

Maybe I get too caught up in 

the idea of canons, of songs being 
good or bad not based on the 
actual recordings, but on whether 
they’re over- or underrated by 
the general public. Not all music 
has to be cool or accepted as great 
or 
undiscovered 
by 
licensing 

agencies. Sometimes, the most 
obvious, true statement of feeling 
is the best option. If some people 
listen to “Good Riddance” and 
think, “Yeah, I did have the time of 
my life,” that’s still pretty cool.

Dancing.” To re-enact that iconic

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

There’s 
something 
about 

traveling while listening to music 
that always affects me. It’s hard 
to say what it is, whether it’s the 
scenery around me, the people I’m 
with or the activity I’m doing, but I 
am always in a certain state when 
I’m listening to music and moving. 
And it changes all the time.

As someone who takes 10-hour 

car rides home from college, doesn’t 
leave 
her 
apartment 
without 

headphones, drives multiple hours 
to swim meets, etc., I seem to find 
this emotional state happening 
often. As most people do, I put on 
my favorite playlists and albums to 
pass the time.

But what I’ve noticed about 

“music in motion” is that there 
seems to be some sort of exterior 
impact. 
Example: 
the 
movies 

where there is a girl riding the bus 
while she stares out the window 
and some sappy The Fray song 
comes on. Even though in real life, 
nothing would be heard, there’s 
music playing in the moment, 
and thus the entire scene makes 
the viewer feel a little teary-eyed. 
Setting and melody combines into 
a state of thinking, of listening and 
of feeling, and I often get into that 
state of mind when I travel.

I’m the type of person to listen 

to music when walking around 
campus and when working at my 
job. Yes, there is a sense of seclusion 
when I do this, but it also affects 
the way I see the community 
around me. I observe the actions of 
people hustling through the Diag; 

I pay closer attention to the trees 
and how they change. I notice the 
architecture, and I’m more aware 
of the thoughts that are being 
applied when I view this kind of 
environment. Music gives me a lens 
that I couldn’t assume if I wasn’t 
listening to it.

There’s walking, though, and 

then there’s driving. I distinctly 
remember my first road trip with 
my current college roommate. We 
were going to Cedar Point for fall 
break, and we decided to play some 
of our favorite songs. Whether that 
be alternative, rap or even country, 
my friendship with Perie was built 
upon music.

In the car, she would play a song, 

explain how it reminded her of a 
past boyfriend and then we would 
stare off into the Ohio sunset. Then 
it would be my turn, and I’d put on 
a song, explaining how it reminded 
me of a friend that passed away, 
all while we were going 75 mph. 
There was a feeling of content and 
closeness that I had with Perie on 
that five-hour adventure. However, 
the confines of the car made no 
impact on our vocal and auditory 
freedom.

And it’s not just our sad-girl 

songs that make us feel emotional 
— it’s belting “Shot at the Night” 
by the Killers and feeling like rock 
stars, or harmonizing to “Roses” 
by the Chainsmokers and feeling 
like we’re at tailgates again. It’s the 
moments when we introduce songs 
to one another as if they have been 
a longtime friend of ours; we have 
such a connection to the song, and 
with that, we have a connection to 
each other.

To this day, I listen to the songs 

that Perie introduced to me on that 
road trip. No matter where I am 
or what I’m doing, I always know 
that those specific songs were 
first listened to in my Jeep with 
someone who is now my best friend 
at college — that construct itself 
holds such a strong sentiment.

Nowadays, this emotional state 

varies. With two more roommates 
from the East Coast, we all drive 
home together, make a collaborative 
playlist and listen to everybody’s 
unique music tastes. It ranges from 
Perie’s Kanye to Lauren’s Frank 
Ocean to Emily’s Stevie Wonder 
and to my Fleetwood Mac. One 
minute, Bon Iver puts us to sleep, 
and the next minute Lauren and I 
are freestyle rapping.

Then I’ll look ahead at each 

white dash of the highway as it 
disappears under the car. We 
remind ourselves that we have been 
driving this entire time during our 
makeshift concert. It’s these kinds 
of communal experiences that 
enrich the bonds I have with my 
roommates, and it goes beyond the 
moments in the Jeep. We go to a 
cappella concerts together, share 
our party playlists before going out 
or even look up holiday trap music 
to get hype for winter break.

Traveling with music creates a 

state of ecstasy for me, one where 
I can be overjoyed or nostalgic or 
pumped up. It’s a secure feeling 
even though I am not grounded. 
Memories can be made when I’m 
in that car with my roommates or 
when I’m flying by myself or simply 
when walking to class. The way 
one’s surroundings can change, but 
the tune in her ears does not, is a 
moment I find to be truly ineffable.

The ecstasy of traveling with music

STYLE NOTEBOOK

I’m great at sharing food. 

Want a piece of gum, a bite of 
pizza, a sip of my drink? I’m your 
girl. Sharing trends, however? 
Eh, not so much. Who wants to 
look the same as everyone else? 
What’s the fun in that? Nothing 
drops an anvil on your mood 
like discovering the world has 
latched onto what used to be 
your personal favorite.

But the gut-punch of seeing 

three other students wearing 
your favorite shirt is doubly as 
awful as, say, spotting what you 
thought was a cool indie find 
on Billboard’s Top 100. Fashion 
is an expression of self, be it 
conscious or not. The clothes 
you choose communicate facets 
of your personality to everyone 
who throws you a wayward 
glance. When you purchase a 
piece of clothing, you are adding 
to your external narrative. When 
the masses adopt the same trend, 
it fundamentally changes the 
message.

So just don’t wear it — it’s an 

easy solution, no? Except you fell 
in love with that piece. You saw 
it worn by that it-girl whose life 
you secretly covet and wondered, 
while scrolling through pages 
upon pages of online shopping, 
whether you could pull it off. 
Finally, after a week of leaving 
it sitting hopefully in your cart, 
anxiously checking it regularly 

to ensure that your size hasn’t 
sold out, you pulled the trigger 
and 
lessened 
your 
already 

dwindling bank account a little 
more.

You sunk your heart and 

about 30 coffees’ worth into that 
purchase. Leaving it in a heap 
in the back of your closet never 
to be worn again isn’t a feasible 
option. But then again, can you 
put a price on sartorial pride?

I struggle internally whenever 

I wear Adidas Superstars.

Buying them was another 

story. As I rode the escalator 
up to the third floor of the 
Adidas flagship store, as Mary 
J. Blige’s “Family Affair” loudly 
echoed throughout the premise, 
I was buzzed on egoism. I was 
surrounded by the hip, the 
sporty, the cool, and I felt like 
the shit. Did I flip my hair and 
pop my hip? Possibly; that’s what 
M.J. Blige and copious shoes do 
to a girl.

I beelined to the men’s section 

— Ooo, I’m buying from the 
menswear section, how cool — 
where the triple-striped sneaker 
was proudly displayed. They 
called to me like harmonious 
cherubs, as if they were haloed 
in soft, golden light. I slid my foot 
into the rubber-soled slipper, 
and I was sold.

I wore them with pride, often.
But then, so did everyone else. 

To my horror, I found myself in 
elevators where every girl was 
wearing a pair. I stared down at 
their white sneakers, imploring 

them with all my might to 
dematerialize. I do not own the 
style; I was not the first to adopt 
the style; I know I don’t have 
the right to plunge a flag into 
the shoe, and claim it as mine, 
and mine alone. But if I could, I 
would.

My predicament worsened. 

My 
beloved 
sneakers 
faced 

character 
assassination 
via 

meme. Basic Bitch Starter Packs 
everywhere featured the shoe. 
Call an item basic, and I’ll 
embody the “X” armed emoji 
girl and scramble away from it 
with the same franticness and 
urgency as if it were a venomous 
spider. And yet, I could not bring 
myself to chuck my pair.

I continued to wear the 

shoe, but became increasingly 
paranoid. Was everyone noticing 
my choice of footwear? Did they 
care? Did they think less of my 
outfit, or me, because of it?

I can’t stop wearing them; 

they’re perfect. My closet is 
cluttered with stunning shoes, 
but time and time again I go 
with my Superstars. My heels 
hinder my ability to make it 
across campus in the University 
of 
Michigan 
time 
window. 

And my flats give me blisters. I 
need a sneaker. The neutrality 
of Superstars enables them to 
dissolve into any outfit, and their 
orthopedic support keeps my 
feet from crying mutiny. So label 
me as basic, if you must, but I 
won’t be retiring them anytime 
soon.

The year is 2074, but rather 

than 
robots 
or 
artificial 

intelligence ruling over society, 
“Incorporated” 
entertains 
the 

possibility of big 
business takeovers 
in the aftermath 
of a climate crisis 
that divided the 
world 
into 
two 

parts — the haves 
and 
the 
have-

nots. 
While 
the 

haves 
contribute 

to the new order 
society in return 
for luxurious living 
inside the “Green 
Zone,” the have-nots live in the 
squalor of a decimated outer city, 
colloquially known as the “Red 
Zone.”

However, the chaos that ensues 

in a world overtaken by Big 
Brother is the least concerning 
aspect in Syfy’s newest original 
series, which paints a picture of a 
future too probable for comfort. 

A common characteristic of 

the science fiction genre is the 
mirroring of fragments of reality 
onto a grander scale. After all, for 
what other purpose does the genre 
serve but to highlight our deepest 
fears regarding the unknown? 
Where series such as “The 100” 
and “Firefly” focus entirely on 
the distant future with little ties 
to reality, “Incorporated” shares 
similarities with “Revolution,” 
which 
imagined 
a 
possible 

scenario in the not-too-distant 
future.

What 
makes 
these 
series 

realistic is often the science behind 
the fiction. The settings are close 
enough to put viewers on edge, but 

far enough away to allow for the 
necessary advances to make said 
future possible. Self-driving cars 
and “Iron Man”-esque technology 
are only a few of the amenities that 
this future has to offer.

So while 2074 might be a little 

early 
for 
these 

natural disasters to 
actually occur, the 
technology seems 
to fit; it’s neither 
overwhelmingly 
advanced 
nor 
primitive 

compared to the 
devices 
available 

on today’s market. 
The 
believable 

plot coupled with 
the 
convincing 

setting 
is 
ultimately 
what 

makes “Incorporated” not only 
watchable, 
but 
relevant 
and 

relatable.

“Incorporated” opens on Ben 

(Sean 
Teale, 
“Survivor”), 
an 

executive for the company Spiga, 
which controls the order between 
the white collar “Green Zone” and 
the squalor of the “Red Zone,” 
which is on the brink of an uprising. 
Although life in the “Green Zone” 
appears comfortable and carefree, 
the big brother capabilities of the 
business world put a psychological 
strain on a society where even 
dreams are no longer safe from the 
public eye.

It’s from this prison that Ben 

has emerged as a true protagonist 
— an undercover agent for an 
undisclosed cause. He’s hacked 
his way into the company elite 
to gain access to top secret 
files 
and 
exclusive 
company 

information. The purpose is yet to 
be discovered, but Ben’s ambition 
to single handedly take down 
the new government standard is 

ambitious in itself.

This is a role that Teale portrays 

well, with quiet ties between 
the revolutionaries of the “Red 
Zone” and notable treason against 
the corporate hires he fights 
off in his mission to the top. To 
further his cause, his wife Laura 
(Allison Miller, “There’s Always 
Woodstock”) is conveniently the 
daughter of Spiga CEO Elizabeth 
(Julia 
Ormond, 
“Witches 
of 

East End”), the former of whom 
suffers from PTSD regarding 
an abduction incident into the 
“Red Zone,” which we will later 
learn more about as the season 
progresses.

However, Ben’s relationship 

with Laura, though ruled almost 
entirely by work and less so by 
feelings, only serves to highlight 
Teale’s flaw in his seamless switch 
between home life and spy work 
inside Spiga. The strain of his 
twisted lies only really shines 
through in the most thrilling 
moments of the episode, and his 
switch between the two should 
even out in later episodes if 
“Incorporated” intends to keep 
the audience hooked on Ben’s 
deception.

The 
stunning 
similarities 

between today’s advancements in 
science and technology and the 
technology in the show are the 
basis on which “Incorporated” 
thrives. The show melds present 
and future with stunning quality 
and on point accuracy. However, 
if it wishes to keep up its satire 
— a wall being built around the 
city, for example, has clear ties 
to the impending Donald Trump 
presidency — it needs to work 
on smoothing out its characters 
before 
humanity 
can 
begin 

worrying 
about 
the 
not-too-

distant future.

W

hen he died at age 
50 in 1911, the Aus-
trian composer and 

conductor Gustav Mahler left 
us all of his 
sympho-
nies, except 
one. After 
nine titanic 
works in 
the genre, 
unrivaled 
by any of 
his contem-
poraries, 
Mahler 
left a tenth 
unfinished, carrying to the 
grave all the unfulfilled poten-
tial of a master’s last work.

He wasn’t alone in this. 

Many composers throughout 
history — Beethoven, Schubert, 
Bruckner and Dvorák come to 
mind — have suffered from the 
so-called “curse of the ninth,” 
in which Mahler himself was 
a believer. He feared that if he 
were to try composing a tenth 
symphony he would somehow 
stumble into death, like those 
before him. He even went so 
far as to call a piece of music 
which was by all rights a sym-
phony — “Das Lied von der 
Erde” — something that avoid-
ed numbering it as such.

But by 1910, he did start 

working on another symphony, 
and in the end, he was right. It 
killed him.

The period in which he was 

composing the 10th can only 
be described as Mahler’s dark 
night of the soul. It’s not that 
his life up to that point hadn’t 
been difficult. It had. He was, 
after all, a Jewish man from a 
humble family trying to build 
his career in the same Vienna 
where a young man named 
Adolf Hitler was coming of 
age.

Before that, Mahler’s early 

years had been filled with 
personal tragedy, first when a 
younger brother, Ernst, died of 
illness, and again when anoth-
er younger brother, Otto, shot 
himself. Both of these events 
made lasting impressions on 
him.

But it wasn’t until his last 

years that Mahler faced his 
greatest emotional trials. 
In 1907, his daughter Maria 
Ann succumbed to sickness, 
dying at only four years of age. 
Immediately on the heels of 
this loss, the grieving compos-
er was diagnosed with a defec-
tive heart (a literal broken 
heart, as it were). A few years 
later, he discovered his wife 
Alma was having an affair, and 
sought the help of the psycho-
analyst Sigmund Freud to cope 
with his depression.

It was against this emotion-

ally tumultuous background 
that Mahler began composing 
his last, incomplete symphony. 
Of the five planned move-
ments, only the first is fin-
ished, the latter four existing 
only as piano sketches. If you 
don’t already know it, I urge 
you to listen to at least the first 
movement. Really, go listen. It 
will tear your heart out in the 
most beautiful way possible, 

strange as that sounds.

The music is Mahler’s 

most harmonically anxious, 
the elastic tonality stretched 
almost to the sort of break-
ing point that few, like his 
friend Schoenberg, dared to 
traverse. Aching, yearning 
melodies soar and strain over 
the orchestra, violent 10-note 
chords stand like Kubrickian 
monoliths and in the middle of 
it all, there on the manuscript, 
Mahler’s marginalia betrays 
his mental anguish. In looping 
cursive hand, at the moment 
of supreme torment, the words 
“für dich leben! für dich ster-
ben!” — “To live for you! To die 
for you!”

I assume that the message 

is addressed to Alma, but in 
a way it is also addressed to 
us. It’s somewhat paradoxical 
that, as the vessel for his most 
personal emotional expression, 
Mahler chooses to write for 
such a large and public group 
of people as an orchestra. But 
that was what he knew, hav-
ing written orchestral music 
for decades, and being one of 
the greatest conductors of his 
day. And the verbal message 
was written down right there, 
where no one would hear it 
but anyone who engaged with 
the music — with Mahler’s 
emotional expression, so to 
speak — would be able to find 
it. It’s there on the manuscript, 
as part of the composer’s 
thoughts. It’s in the score.

Many people casually 

believe that the score — that is, 
the paper and the notes them-
selves — and the music are 
synonymous, but I don’t think 
this is correct. Others would 
say that music is organized 
sound, frequency and duration 
mapped on to space and time. 
Perhaps in the past, this defi-
nition would have sufficed. But 
writing today, in a time after 
composers like John Cage, who 
eschewed control and organi-
zation, I can’t even feel secure 
in a seemingly innocuous 
descriptions such as that.

At the last, then, some 

would fall back to the sound 
itself (organized or otherwise), 
the longitudinal and trans-
verse waves, the timbre and 
amplitude. They would point 
at it and say, “see, there is the 
answer — that, surely, is the 
music.” Maybe so. But to me 
music is something more, an 
intangible existing half on the 
exterior and half within, resid-
ing somewhere just over the 
horizon of understanding, in 
the place triangulated between 
the Heart, the Mind and the 
Will. If it were simply vibra-
tions in the air, why bother?

The point is, for some rea-

son or another, we believe that 
music expresses something. 
We don’t know why, whether 
it’s some physiological or 
psychological reaction, some 
inherited cultural framework 
or learned social behavior, 
but when most of us listen 
to music, we feel. And so in 
Mahler, the music isn’t what 
we have on the page. Even if 
we had the symphony in its 
entirety, I would still believe 
that when Mahler died, the 
music died with him, because 
the music — the true music — 
was something unutterable 
carried inside his grief. It was 
an emotional state which, 
through his craft, he tried to 
replicate on the page and in 
our ears, to create a roadmap 
to his torment.

The idea of music (and art 

generally) as a personal means 
of expression has increased 
and diminished throughout 
history. In a Classical music 
context, after the longstanding 
traditions of religious expres-
sion began to decline, the 
concept of the composer-as-
protagonist in a work of music 
began to take shape around 
Beethoven, whose music was 
associated with Sturm und 
Drang — storm and stress.

Perhaps one day this men-

tality will again abate, but 
200 years after the death of 
Beethoven, it still remains. 
And I’m not surprised in the 
least. After all, it’s a very com-
pelling model, in all areas of 
art. Just a few days ago, I fin-
ished reading Book 1 of Karl 
Ove Knausgaard’s six-part 
autobiographical novel “My 
Struggle.” It’s a book con-
structed out of ordinary life, 
out of — if not commonplace 
— at least nonextraordinary 
events, with the drama coming 
solely from the pain of the cre-
ator. And it was beautiful.

So I imagine the idea of per-

sonal expression will endure, 
in music and other arts. Even 
composers like Cage, who 
encouraged us to abandon 
this sort of solipsism, still 
expressed at least something. 
Even writing out of silence and 
chance, he had a message. In 
his words, “I have nothing to 
say / and I am saying it / and 
that is poetry / as I need it.”

At close of day, each of us 

feels that there is an impor-
tance, an urgency, to our own 
experience. The travails and 
hardships, the happinesses and 
exultations, all are deemed 
momentous. For artists like 
Mahler, it is the same, and 
when they sit down to cre-
ate they will pour it all out 
onto the page. Flowing down, 
mingled together, the salted 
griefs and blinding ecstasies 
will ignite the artistic flame, 
and at the moment of creation 
will be born an art that is fun-
damentally, irrepressibly and 
unequivocally human.

Many believe the 
score and music 
are synonymous, 

but I don’t.

He’s a man! He’s a musical! 

He’s an episode of Drunk History! 
Alexander Hamilton (1757 – 1804) 
died over 200 years 
ago, but his legacy 
lives 
on. 
Today, 

“Hamilton” 
is 
a 

sensation 
that’s 

sweeping 
the 

nation, just like the 
revolution its titular 
character 
helped 

lead 
240 
years 

prior. It seems like 
everyone has caught 
the “Hamilton” bug, 
including Comedy 
Central’s 
“Drunk 

History.”

The episode begins with Lin-

Manuel Miranda (“Hamilton”) 
walking the streets of the Upper 
West Side with host Derek Waters 
before quickly transitioning to the 
apartment where he (Miranda) 
currently lives. It’s a fitting opening, 
given that the story of Hamilton is 
centered around where he came 
from and where he ended up. In 
the first few minutes, as viewers 
settle in for a 22-minute romp 
through history with Broadway’s 
best, Miranda prepares for an 
afternoon of drinking his way 
through Hamilton’s life.

Waters sets the episode up 

perfectly when he asks Miranda, 
“Do you want to get drunk?”

It’s a treat to watch Miranda 

— a Pulitzer Prize winner and 
MacArthur Genius — share the 
intimate details of Hamilton’s 
life while inebriated. The musical 
“Hamilton” is incredible and 
moving on its own, but there are 
parts of history that simply can’t 

translate to the stage. “Drunk 
History” provides audiences with 
what they can’t get from other 
sources.

An excellent example of these 

minute details comes early in the 

episode, 
when 

Miranda describes 
Hamilton’s 
journey from the 
West 
Indies 
to 

Colonial America. 
A 
horrible 

hurricane “f**ked 
up the Caribbean” 
and 
sent 
the 

young, 
orphaned 

Hamilton packing 
his bags for more 
prosperous shores. 
On his way – and 
this is where it gets 

interesting – the ship caught fire. 
As in, he rode a flaming vessel to 
the land of opportunity. This is 
“the kind of shit you can’t do in 
the play,” Miranda says, further 
coloring the rich history of 
Hamilton’s life.

Both the hurricane and the 

flaming ship emphasize the poetic 
irony of Hamilton’s death. At a 
young age, he survived disease, 
natural disaster and freak flames. 
Once older, he lived through a war. 
It was a single bullet, borne out of 
rash decisions and high-school 
level feuding, that killed him.

The musical does a great job 

of emphasizing the tragedy of 
Hamilton’s death. Interestingly, 
so does “Drunk History,” yet 
in a completely different way. 
Miranda’s drunk musings about 
the lives of both Hamilton and 
his killer, Vice President Aaron 
Burr, somehow resound with deep, 
heartbreaking emotions.

The sporadic and blatantly 

honest storytelling in “Drunk 
History” points out a central truth 
about Hamilton: From the start of 
his life to the end, he was a wildly 
gifted, incredibly troubled genius 
who cared so much about his 
legacy and his name that he let it 
end relationships and eventually, 
his life.

Miranda 
shares 
another 

important fact that isn’t mentioned 
in the musical. Prior to his fateful 
duel with Burr, Hamilton wrote 
and sent a series of letters claiming 
that he had no intention of shooting 
Burr, and that if Burr shot him, 
then it was Burr who was the bad 
guy. His final act forever sealed the 
fate of Burr – writing his place in 
history as a villain and Hamilton’s 
as a martyr.

Over bites of Dominos pasta, 

Miranda observes that, “whether 
Hamilton lived or died, he won the 
duel.”

The 
Hamilton 
special 
of 

“Drunk History” is a pleasure to 
watch and a gift for viewers, fans 
of Miranda especially. Watching 
him narrate the story is the closest 
most audience members will ever 
get to hanging out with (not to 
mention getting drunk with) a 
truly remarkable artist. Like the 
musical, it’s a fresh take on a story 
that is centuries old.

Other highlights of the episode 

include a stellar cast re-enacting 
the 
history, 
a 
rendition 
of 

Semisonic’s “Closing Time” from 
Miranda and a surprise FaceTime 
break with both Questlove and 
Christopher Jackson (“Hamilton” 
’s original George Washington). 

The 22-minute episode doesn’t 

feel nearly long enough. For the 
sake of concise storytelling and 
Miranda’s liver, however, it’s just 
right.

Season Review:
Offensive Line

With the Michigan football 

team’s 2016 regular season in the 
books, the Daily looks back at the 
performance of each unit this year 
and looks ahead to the future in 
2017. In this edition: offensive line.

It was the same story in 2016 as 

in 2015 for the Michigan football 
team’s offensive line, and that was 
good news for the Wolverines.

For the offensive line, the days 

of being the most maligned unit 
on the team in the woeful 2013 and 
2014 seasons are still in memory. 
Three of the five starters on the 
line were regulars on those teams. 
But the back half of their careers 
brought major improvements in 
the line play, and those continued 
this season.

For most of the fall, the ground 

game looked like the Michigan 
rushing attacks of old, led by Chris 
Perry and then Mike Hart in the 
early 2000s, though without as 
much of a workhorse at running 
back. Though the defense was still 
the dominant unit, the Wolverines 
controlled games up front and 
used that edge to salt away the 
clock in their victories.

Statistically, Michigan went 

from 102nd in rushing in 2013 to 
62nd in 2014 to 83rd in 2015 to 
finally 15th this year. The pass 
blocking 
improved, 
too. 
The 

Wolverines gave up more than 
two sacks per game in 2013 and 
2014 before ranking in the top 30 
in that category in each of the past 
two seasons.

Michigan’s offense owes much 

of its success to those trends. The 
ability to run the ball has opened 
up the playbook, and the better 
pass blocking has made life easier 
on quarterbacks Jake Rudock and 
Wilton Speight.

And the improvement has been 

in the making for a long time. 
The three mainstays on the line 
— fifth-year seniors Ben Braden, 
Kyle Kalis and Erik Magnuson — 
took their lumps as young players 
and have spoken all season about 
how much better it made them. 
They were more experienced than 
just about every opposing front 
they faced this season after being 
on the other end of that clash 
earlier in their careers.

Long-term stability is a factor 

as well. Michigan replaced the 
only starter it lost, center Graham 
Glasgow, by sliding junior Mason 
Cole from left tackle to center. 
He along with Braden, Kalis, 
Magnuson and true freshman 
remained the go-to group for 
the last five games of the regular 
season, and Michigan didn’t go 
away from them often, adding to 
their consistency.

Only at the end of the year, 

when the Wolverines played their 
toughest games of the season, did 
the offensive line let up in the run 
game. In late road games at Iowa 
and Ohio State, Michigan rushed 
for fewer than 100 yards for the 
first two times all season. Six 
times, however, they eclipsed the 
200-yard mark.

HIGH POINT: One easy choice 

is the Oct. 8 drubbing of Rutgers, 
in which Michigan ran for 478 
yards and nine touchdowns, 
but the more impressive overall 
performance came two weeks 

earlier against Penn State.

That day, Michigan rushed for 

326 yards and six touchdowns — 
both second-most of the season — 
and did not allow a sack. Starting 
Newsome, Braden, Cole, Kalis 
and Magnuson for the third 
straight week, the offensive line 
jelled and dominated Penn State. 
After that game, Speight said 
that at one point, the Wolverines 
ran the same rushing play over 
and over without being stopped. 
Sure enough, one of Michigan’s 
drives ended with seven straight 
run plays for 43 yards and a 
touchdown.

The 
feat 
is 
even 
more 

impressive in hindsight: Penn 
State has not lost since that day 
and beat Wisconsin in the Big 
Ten Championship on Saturday 
night. The Nittany Lions ended 
up finishing a modest 48th and 
giving up just 153.5 rushing yards 
per game.

LOW POINT: Despite the 

late struggles against Iowa and 
Ohio State, the offensive line’s 
worst moment wasn’t a poor 
performance — it was one of the 
few sour memories Michigan will 
carry from this season. On Oct. 
1 against Wisconsin, Newsome 
went down in the second quarter 
with a serious knee injury, one 
that seemed to dampen the morale 
of the entire team.

Newsome had several surgeries 

on his knee in the weeks following 
his injury, and he ended up 
spending more than a month in 
the hospital. On Dec. 1, he tweeted 
a video of him taking his first steps 
since the injury. A devastating 
blow to one of the more well-liked 
players on the team was tough for 
Michigan to handle.

“What I do know is, as far as 

character, human being character, 
football 
character, 
nobody’s 

ever come through here, this 
football team or this university, 
that I know of, with more of it 
than Grant Newsome,” coach 
Jim Harbaugh said two days 
after the injury. “Leon and Kim 
Newsome, they should write a 
book on raising kids. Grant is the 
finest, and just praying for him 
right now. It’s not a good feeling 
today at all. But just being with 
him at the hospital, everybody 
he’s come in contact with, nurses 
and doctors, it’s ‘please’ and 
‘thank you.’ It’s amazing. He is an 
amazing, amazing young man.”

THE FUTURE: As in many 

areas, 
Michigan’s 
decorated 

senior class will leave some holes 
on the offensive line. Braden, Kalis 
and Magnuson have exhausted 
their eligibility, and Cole said he is 
undecided between returning for 
a senior season and entering the 
NFL Draft.

If he returns and Bredeson 

stays at left guard, that leaves 
openings at left tackle, right 
guard and right tackle. Redshirt 
sophomore 
Juwann 
Bushell-

Beatty — who started at left tackle 
Oct. 8 at Rutgers — is one option 
to take over that spot if Cole and 
Bredeson stay at their positions. 
On the right side, the competition 
will be wide-open, but one name 
to watch is promising freshman 
guard Michael Onwenu. Whoever 
takes over the workload, though, 
will have a lot of experience to 
replace.

‘M’ to host Badgers in weekend series

Monday 
afternoon, 
the 

Michigan hockey team held a 
meeting to discuss its performance 
in its most recent series against 
No. 3 Penn State, where the 
Wolverines were swept by a 
combined score of 11-2. Heading 
into the upcoming weekend with 
another high-scoring team on the 
schedule in Wisconsin, Michigan 
coach Red Berenson urged his 
team to move forward.

“At some point we’ve gotta put 

it behind us,” Berenson said. “After 
Monday, it was more about this 
week than last week. You can’t 
drag yourself through the mud for 
a whole week.”

Added sophomore defenseman 

Nicholas Boka: “We need to be 
better. That (performance) is not 
acceptable here at Michigan. We 
know it and our coaches know 
it. (The coaches) just said what 
we put in this week in practice is 
gonna show during the games this 
weekend, so they said, ‘let’s just 
start preparing now.’ ”

Like the Nittany Lions, the 

Badgers rank in the top 20 
nationally in scoring, averaging 
3.36 goals per game, nearly 
a whole goal more than the 
Wolverines. Forward Luke Kunin 
anchors Wisconsin’s offensive 
attack, leading the Badgers with 
17 points. Two years ago, Boka 
and Kunin played with each other 
as members of the USNTDP. As 
the team’s captain, Kunin scored 
27 times, which was fourth best 
on the team.

In their second season apart, the 

two former teammates-turned-
rivals have maintained their close 
relationship. And Boka says he 
uses his knowledge of Kunin’s 
playing style to his advantage.

“He’s my best friend,” Boka 

said. “It’s been different, playing 
against each other. You’re friends 
off the ice, but when it comes time 
to play against each other, you 

don’t think twice on the ice.

I know his tendencies and what 

he likes to do and whether that’s 
on the power play or just simple 
things. But I think when it comes 
down to it, we gotta be worried 
about the whole team, not just one 
player.”

Boka and Kunin aren’t the 

only players from the Wolverines 
and the Badgers who have played 
together on the USNTDP. Last 
season, five Michigan players 
along with Wisconsin defenseman 
James Greenway and center Trent 
Frederic all were teammates on 
the USNTDP as well.

For Boka though, the game 

also represents a chance to face-
off against his former coach on 
the USNTDP, Don Granato, who 
serves as assistant coach under 
his brother Tony in Madison. Like 
with Kunin, Boka still remains in 
touch with Don despite their intra-
conference rivalry.

“He’s a great guy to have if I 

have any questions or ways I can 
improve my game,” Boka said. 
“He’s definitely been a big help to 
my career.”

In 
their 
first 
season 
at 

Wisconsin, the Granato brothers 
have turned a team that won just 
eight games all last year into a 
group that could make a run for 
the conference title. In their non-
conference schedule, the Badgers 
faced four ranked teams and beat 
two, nearly equalling last season’s 
total of three.

The upcoming matchup will 

have a different vibe for the 
Wolverines, too. In their four 
games against Wisconsin last year, 
Michigan scored 20 goals and 
swept the Badgers in both series. 
In fact, Wisconsin hasn’t defeated 
the Wolverines in Ann Arbor since 
November 26, 2005.

This year’s matchup could be 

a bit different, though. Michigan 
isn’t the high-scoring team it 
used to be, and Wisconsin ranks 
fourth in percentage of shots 
taken vs. opponent, with a 57.9 

rate. The Wolverines’ blue-line 
wants to avoid a repeat of last 
weekend, when Michigan allowed 
a combined 106 shots in the two 
games.

“We definitely have to help out 

our goalies,” Boka said. “Friday 
night against Penn State, I think 
we gave up over 40 shots, and 
that’s just not the way to win 
games, and that can’t happen 
moving forward. I think as a 
whole D corps, we gotta step it up 
and start playing for those guys 
and give them the best chance to 
win games for us.

“We definitely want to focus on 

limiting Grade A opportunities, 
the chances they get close to our 
net. You can’t give up 55 shots and 
expect our goalie to make a save on 
every single one.”

Berenson 
recognizes 
the 

Badgers’ marked improvement 
from last season, as well as the 
challenges his Wolverines face, but 
he is eager for the series.

“They’ve got a new coaching 

staff, and they’re as good as it 
gets,” Berenson said. “They’ve 
inherited a pretty darn talented 
team, and some really good young 
players. Their power play is a good 
example. They have one of the best 
power plays in the country, and 
right now, they’re getting it done. 
I’m sure they want to improve, but 
they’re off to a pretty good start. 
They’ve played good teams, and 
they’ve done well.

“We’ve got a lot of respect for 

what they’ve done and where 
they’ve coached. I think it’ll be 
a good matchup this weekend, 
they’ll be excited and we’ll be 
excited.” 

Wolverines to wrap road swing

After spending 14 of its last 

20 days on the road, the end of 
an exhausting seven-game road 
swing is almost in sight for the 
Michigan women’s basketball 
team. The only thing standing 
in the way of the Wolverines and 
Crisler Center are games at San 
Diego State on Friday and No. 9 
UCLA on Sunday. 

The 
Wolverines 
(7-2) 
are 

coming off a 61-58 loss in a 
defensive battle with Xavier, 
and Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico is pointing to the team’s 
hectic schedule as contributing 
to its fall. 

“That was a tough one,” 

Barnes Arico said in an interview 
with WTKA. “A couple days 
later, and we’re still feeling that 
… Our confidence got shook a 
little because we were asking 
people who don’t normally shoot 
the ball for us to score.

“They were an undefeated 

team who hasn’t played away 
from their home court yet. 
So 
they 
were 
well 
rested. 

(Thompson) said to me after the 
game, ‘My legs haven’t felt like 
that in four years.’ So, I think 
the travel is kind of getting to 
us a little bit. But we keep really 
preaching to our team that this 
is going to prepare us for the Big 
Ten Tournament and the NCAA 
Tournament.”

Michigan’s trip to California 

will be its first since the 2013 
NCAA Tournament. The team 
will be jostling for a victory 
against 
the 

Aztecs 
(2-5) 

and 
attempting 

to 
secure 
its 

second 
top-25 

win against the 
Bruins (6-1). 

Notably, it will 

be the first time 
senior 
guard 

Siera Thompson 
will play in her 
home state. 

“This is something we really 

wanted to do, ever since Siera 
committed to us,” Barnes Arico 
said. “To get her back home 

in front of her friends and her 
family. She’s really excited, as 
well as Danielle Williams. Her 
sister plays at UCLA.

“UCLA is a top program in 

the country, year in and year 

out, with some 
really 
good 

players. 
We’ve 

played them the 
last couple years 
and had some 
great 
games. 

It’s going to be 
challenging, but 
our kids are very 
excited for the 
opportunity 
to 

get out there.” 

The last time Michigan and 

San Diego State met was in 
2014 in Puerto Rico, with the 
Wolverines winning the bout, 

70-50. 
The 
game 
featured 

career-high scoring from both 
junior guard Katelynn Flaherty 
and Thompson, who had 23 and 
25 points, respectively. 

The Aztecs just fell to UC 

Davis, 75-55, with only one 
player, guard McKynzie Fort, 
scoring in double digits. San 
Diego State is allowing and 
average of 70.6 points per game 
while scoring just 60.4 points per 
game on average. 

Contrastingly, the Bruins have 

won five straight games and are 
celebrating a 72-49 victory over 
Hawaii. The Wolverines will 
have to matchup against forward 
Monique Billings and guards 
Jordin Canada and Kennedy 
Burke, who are all averaging 
in the double digits points per 
game. 

Even outside of Michigan’s 

double-digit scorers — freshman 
guard 
Kysre 
Gondrezick, 

sophomore center Hallie Thome, 
Thompson and Flaherty — the 
Wolverines’ depth has been 
evident. 

That will be key as the 

Wolverines must grapple with 
staying healthy in these final two 
games of the stretch.

“It’s been a tough balance,” 

Barnes Arico said. “Some players 
really need those rests, and they 
really need practice, to get their 
confidence back… But I think 
what has really helped our 
program, and this is something 
we continue to stress, is we can 
go deep into our bench and give 
people a break. 

“I think that’s what separates 

good teams from great teams.”

Wolverines head west to visit high-scoring UCLA

The 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball team’s defense had 
to dig deep to come away with 
a win against Texas on Tuesday 
because the offense scored just 
53 points.

While 
the 
Wolverines 

struggled 
to 
find 
anything 

consistent 
on 
offense, 
the 

Longhorns were just as poor 
attacking, and Michigan was 
able to fall back on its defense to 
find a way in the end.

The Wolverines (7-2) won’t 

want to stick to that same 
strategy when they travel to 
Pauley Pavilion on Saturday 
to take on No. 2 UCLA (9-0). 
The Bruins have the nation’s 
second-highest scoring offense, 
averaging 97 points per game. 

They run one of the most high-
tempo offenses as well, ranking 
in the top 10 in possessions per 
40 minutes.

Michigan has already played 

teams that like to score in 
transition such as Virginia Tech 
and the Longhorns, and the 
Wolverines handled both teams 
well. Michigan ranks 10th in the 
country in scoring defense.

“I 
thought 
we 
handled 

the tempo pretty well,” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein on 
the Virginia Tech game. “The 
tempo was at a pace that got us 
a few times, but not as many 
times as they’ve been getting 
other people. (UCLA) is a team 
that will really run. Some of the 
teams they’ve played have gotten 
in that running game with them. 
We’re still only going to run 
when we can, but at the same 

time we have to make sure we 
take good shots and we make 
them take hard shots.”

But 
no 
opponent 
the 

Wolverines have faced to date 
had as many offensive weapons 
as the Bruins. All five of UCLA’s 
starters are putting up double-
digit scoring averages, and each 
can score in a variety of different 
ways.

UCLA’s offense stems from 

the point and its star freshman 
guard Lonzo Ball. The 6-foot-6 
guard poses the threat of posting 
a triple-double every game he 
takes the floor. Against then-No. 
1 Kentucky, Ball put up a stat line 
of 14 points, six rebounds and 
seven assists.

But Ball is still prone to 

making freshman mistakes. He 
committed five turnovers while 
shooting 1-for-5 in the first half of 
the Kentucky game. Even while 
making those errors, he was 

showing off the most impressive 
facet of his game. The freshman 
currently leads the nation in 
assists per game (9.3) to go with 
his 15 point scoring average.

Complimenting Ball at the 

post is freshman TJ Leaf, who is 
also almost averaging a double-
double with 17 points and nine 
rebounds per game. At 6-foot-
11, Leaf isn’t just a threat in the 
paint, he’s an outside shooting 
threat as well. The freshman, 
who Beilein once recruited, is 
currently shooting 67 percent 
from the field and 50 percent 
from three. His versatility will 
be a handful for any Michigan 
defender tasked with guarding 
him, likely redshirt sophomore 
forward DJ Wilson.

“(Leaf) really is not just a 

6-(foot)-10 
forward,” 
Beilein 

said. “He shoots, he passes. 
Look at his stats right now. For 
a freshman with a 225-pound 

body, the way he’s rebounding 
right now is really impressive in 
the game.”

Besides Ball and Leaf, UCLA 

has three other players shooting 
over 40 percent from behind the 
arc in guards Bryce Alford, Isaac 
Hamilton and Aaron Holiday.

The Bruins can score from just 

about anywhere on the offensive 
end, and Beilein realizes no 
other team will be a better test to 
see if Michigan’s top-10 scoring 
defense can hold up.

“(This game is) the ultimate 

gauge of who we are against a 
high-level team,” Beilein said. 
“We got some incredible talent. 
I think what’s really compelling 
right now is what Ball and Leaf 
have done to that team. That was 
a team that was sub-.500 last 
year and only lost one player. But 
those two are just exceptional. “

UCLA’s fast pace will also 

challenge 
the 
Wolverines’ 

offense. Michigan hasn’t been 
efficient scoring points on fast 
breaks or in transition, choosing 
too often to hold the ball up and 
go into half-court sets.

While running a half-court 

offense could slow the Bruins’ 
attack down, the Wolverines will 
still need to find a fair share of 
points on breaks to have a shot at 
the upset.

“We’re playing too much half-

court basketball,” Beilein said. 
“We have to get up the court. 
Whether it’s who’s pushing it, 
right now (senior guard Derrick 
Walton) has been the only push 
guy, and he’s even got to do more 
there. “

Saturday will be Michigan’s 

last opportunity to measure up 
against 
marquee 
competition 

before 
Big 
Ten 
play 
opens, 

especially defensively. And it will 
be the best opportunity yet for the 
Wolverines to make a statement.
