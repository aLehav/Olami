Ann 
Arbor 
rents 
are 
skyrocketing, according to recent 
reports. The city’s rent is the 
second fastest growing among 
college towns. 
Separate reports from rental 
and real estate websites Zumper 
and RENTCafé confirmed Ann 
Arbor’s increasing rental rates. 
Zumper examined the year-over-
year rental growth rates of 50 
college towns around the country, 
comparing the average rate for 

one bedroom in 2019 to the rate 
in 2018. With a year-over-year 
rent increase of 15.9 percent, Ann 
Arbor came in second following 
Gainesville, Fla., the home of the 
University of Florida and a 16.7 
percent growth rate.
Ann 
Arbor’s 
average 
one 
bedroom rate has increased from 
$850 in 2018 to $985 in 2019. 
East Lansing also made it into 
the top ten of the rankings — its 
rent increased by 14.3 percent. 
However, rent was lower in East 
Lansing than in Ann Arbor, 
increasing from $700 in 2018 to 

$800 in 2019. 
Social Work student Laura 
Rall is president of Affordable 
Michigan, a student organization 
focusing on improving the quality 
of life for lower-socioeconomic 
status students at the University. 
Rall attended the University as an 
undergraduate student and has 
noticed rent and housing costs 
increasing during her time in Ann 
Arbor each year. 
“After 
living 
here 
for 
six 
years, I’ve definitely noticed rent 
continuing to increase,” Rall said. 
“Every year, landlords will send 

you a notice about renewing your 
lease, and they often say, ‘If you 
renew your lease, rent will go up 
this much.’ I’ve never had a friend 
whose rent stayed the same after 
renewing their lease.”
LSA junior Hailey Pantaleo 
has noticed the differences in 
rent between Ann Arbor and 
other college towns in Michigan. 
Pantaleo’s 
sister 
attended 
Saginaw Valley State University 
in University Center, and her rent 
was around half of what Pantaleo 
pays in Ann Arbor.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

The University of Michigan 
Senate Advisory Committee 
on University Affairs met on 
Monday for their first meeting 
of the academic year. Members 
primarily discussed various 
Senate Assembly committees, 
such as the Academic Affairs 
Advisory 
Committee, 
the 
Government 
Relations 
Advisory Committee and the 
Student Relations Advisory 

Committee.
SACUA Chair Joy Beatty, 
U-M 
Dearborn 
professor 
of organizational behavior, 
began 
the 
meeting 
with 
several 
announcements 
updating the group on the 
University’s 
application 
to 
host the 2020 presidential 
debates on campus. She said 
the University should hear 
within the next six weeks if it 
receives the bid. 
“It 
could 
be 
a 
really 
tremendous opportunity for 

classroom activities related 
to the election,” Beatty said. 
“But we don’t know if it’s 
happening yet.”
Beatty then asked SACUA 
members to provide feedback 
to the provost’s office on 
the 
emergency 
alert 
opt-
out 
project, 
which 
would 
automatically 
register 
all 
University students, faculty 
and staff to receive emergency 
alerts. 
Currently, the University 
has an opt-in system, meaning 

individuals must voluntarily 
sign up to receive alerts. 
During 
the 
March 
active 
shooter scare, many University 
community members did not 
receive alerts because they 
had not opted-in to the system, 
Beatty pointed out. 
ll SACUA members agreed 
the 
project 
would 
be 
a 
positive step. Deirdre Spencer, 
a 
University 
librarian, 
highlighted 
the 
opt-out 
system still gives users choice.

State Sen. Jeff Irwin, D-Ann 
Arbor, recently introduced a 
bill to ban privately owned 
prisons in the state. 
The bill comes after the 
news that the North Lake 
Correctional Facility, a prison 
owned by the correctional 
institutions 
company 
GEO 
Group, is reopening. It has 
been contracted by the Federal 
Bureau of Prisons to house non-
U.S. citizens for immigration 
offenses, 
according 
to 
the 
Detroit News.
However, even if the bill 
passes, it will not impact 
the use of the North Lake 
Correctional Facility in this 
case because it was contracted 
by the federal government, 
Irwin said.
“There’s nothing a state can 
do that can impair the federal 
government and their ability 
to spend their money how they 
want,” Irwin said. “So that’s 
just the practical reality of the 
law — that the state can’t pass 
anything that would prevent 
the federal government from 
engaging their contract.”
In Irwin’s opinion, Michigan 
has not had a good track record 
with private prisons.

Lawmakers propose revoking medical 
licenses of convicted sexual predators

A proposal to issue up to $27 
million in bonds to expand and 
improve the Ann Ashley Parking 
Structure was rejected by the 
Ann Arbor City Council 9-2 on 
Tuesday.
The main expansion to add 
three parking decks would cost 
$21.7 million. The proposal also 
includes a $4 million plan to build 
a new Downtown Development 
Authority office and community 
meeting 
space, 
which 
was 
recommended by the Design 
Review Board and unanimously 
accepted by the DDA board.
City Administrator Howard 
Lazarus said the $4 million 
project was proposed because 
the current DDA office’s lease at 
150 S. Fifth Ave. expires soon — 
in two years, according to MLive. 
Lazarus added the proposal is 
more cost efficient.
“The proposal was analyzed 
and proved to be more cost 
efficient over the long term over 
renting and also provided much 
needed 
community 
meeting 
space,” Lazarus said.
DDA 
Executive 
Director 
Susan Pollay said the meeting 
space would “encourage more 
public participation in local 
matters.”

The 
Michigan 
House 
of Represenatives passed 
a series of bills with the 
hope of correcting issues 
uncovered by the Larry 
Nassar sexual abuse case on 
Wednesday
If signed into law, House 
Bills 4372 and 4373 would 
revoke doctor licenses of 
doctors convicted of sexual 
assault. 
These 
bills 
are 
sponsored by state Reps. 
Annette Glenn, R-Midland, 
and Daire Rendon, R-Lake 
City. 
The set of bills come as the 
Department of Education 
fined 
Michigan 
State 
University 
$4.5 
million 
Thursday for inadequately 
responding to the Nassar 
case.
In 
an 
interview 
with 
The Daily, Rendon said the 
bills’ passage was a long 
time coming. The damage 
the perpetrator leaves is 
profound, she said, and it is 
important that the survivor 
does not feel alone.
“The 
severity 
of 
the 

punishment 
— 
it 
seems 
severe and it is, but it pales in 
comparison to the long-term 
punishment and the long-
term memory that these 
victims have to take with 
them and to deal with for the 
rest of their lives,” Rendon 
said. 
“Their 
trust 
was 
violated, and it takes a long 
time to rebuild that trust.”
Engineering 
sophomore 
Leah Webber is a Sexual 
Assault 
Prevention 
and 
Awareness Center volunteer 
involved with the Consent, 
Outreach 
& 
Relationship 
Education program. She said 
the bill is a step in the right 
direction.
“I 
think 
anyone 
who 
was 
convicted 
of 
sexual 
assault should not be able 
to be practicing medicine,” 
Webber 
said. 
“I 
think 
medicine is a very physical 
science ... (those convicted 
of assault) should not have 
access to people’s bodies 
because 
they 
don’t 
have 
control 
over 
themselves 
around 
other 
peoples 
bodies.”

Ann Arbor City Council 
voted 10-1 Tuesday to approve 
a two-year contract with 
SDS Global Enterprises Inc. 
to provide diversity, equity 
and 
inclusion 
consulting. 
Councilmember Jeff Hayner, 
D-Ward 1, was opposed. 
SDS 
Global 
Enterprises 
Inc. was deemed to be the 
most qualified in assisting 
the 
development 
of 
the 
city’s diversity, equity and 
inclusion plan and complies 
with the requirements of the 
city’s non-discrimination and 
living wage ordinances.
SDS 
Global 
Enterprises 
Inc. is run by Dr. Shirley 
Davis, a leadership counselor 
and 
experienced 
diversity 
and 
inclusion 
officer. 
According to SDS’ website, it 

is a “woman and minority-
owned 
C-Corporation 
that 
provides 
strategic 
development solutions that 
enable organizational leaders 
to build high performing and 
inclusive cultures that thrive 
in a competitive and changing 
environment.” 
Sharie Sell is the city of 
Ann Arbor’s diversity, equity 
and inclusion officer. She 
said the eventual diversity, 
equity and inclusion plan 
will provide guidance and 
ensure the city facilities are 
inclusive. 
“The consultant will assist 
the City by advising on the best 
way to set up a sustainable, 
comprehensive 
Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion Plan 
that 
is 
organizationally 
transformative,” 
Sell 
wrote to The Daily in an 
email interview. “One that 

addresses 
racial, 
gender, 
identity, age, and economic 
inequities and disparities in 
the delivery of services.”
For the first year of services, 
the 
consulting 
agency 
is 
expected to review the city’s 
employee 
demographic 
data. They will also conduct 
cultural 
assessments, 
focus 
groups, 
one-on-one 
stakeholder interviews and a 
staff survey. The survey will 
attempt to identify trends 
and deficiencies in hiring 
practices. 
The 
second 
year 
plan 
includes 
helping 
the 
city 
develop a long term plan 
for 
diversity, 
equity 
and 
inclusion, 
while 
holding 
strategic planning sessions 
with key stakeholders.
One of the agency’s tasks 
will 
be 
developing 
and 
executing 
a 
training 
and 
education strategy to 
increase 
awareness, 
knowledge and skills for 
700-plus city staffers, 
councilmembers 
and 
members of city boards 
and commissions as it 
pertains to diversity, 
equity and inclusion.
The $161,000 budget 
has 
created 
a 
stir 
among 
community 
members 
who 
think 
the 
expenditure 
is 
too 
much. 
Hayner 
explained he opposed 
the proposal because of 
the cost.
“I do not think the 
benefits to be derived 
from the service are 
worth the rate charged. 
We have many needs 
as a city and $450/
hour consulting fees for 
undefined HR problems 
is not one of them,” 
Hayner wrote to The 
Daily. 
Hayner said he has 
received requests from 
people seeking legal aid 
around housing issues, 

specifically 
from 
students 
and seniors.
“That’s a real need in or 
community and it involves 
equity and diversity,” Hayner 
wrote. “There have not been 

to my knowledge any requests 
from staff for this (DEI) 
training, this is simply a way 
to fulfill our promises to the 
One Community Initiative.” 
LSA 
junior 
Bridget 
Corwin is spearheading DEI 
efforts for the University 
of 
Michigan 
organization 
WeListen. Corwin said that 
she would be willing to 
pay for funding that helps 
progress DEI objectives in 
her organizations and her 
government. 
“It’s 
everyone’s 
responsibility to create a 
culture that values diversity 
and 
inclusion,” 
Corwin 
said.“The reality is that our 
culture 
does 
not 
always 
value these things, leading to 
systemic issues like racism, 
classism, ableism, etc. which 
unjustly 
disenfranchises 
so many people. I would be 
willing to pay a tax that could 
help move a city, state, or 
country in a positive cultural 
direction 
through 
DEI 
initiatives.”

The reality is 
that our culture 
does not always 
value these 
things, leading to 
systemic issues 
like racism. 

DESIGN BY ROSEANNE CHAO


He cited the same prison, 
the North Lake Correctional 
Facility in Baldwin, as an 
example of a private prison 
that 
has 
treated 
inmates 
inhumanely.
“They 
promised 
cost-
saving but instead had cost 
overruns,” Irwin said. “They 
cut corners in ways that 
resulted 
in 
people 
being 
abused, and the state being 
sued, and the state having 
to pay out all sorts of money, 
and many of our people being 
treated inhumanely. It was a 
total disaster.”
Despite the bill not directly 
impacting the facility, Irwin 
said it sends a message to 
private 
prison 
companies 
and the federal government 
that Michigan does not want 
privately owned prisons in the 
state.
History professor Heather 
Ann Thompson, a Pulitzer 
Prize 
winning 
author, 
said private prisons are a 
mechanism 
for 
companies 
and people to profit off of 
mass incarceration and the 
suffering of others. 
“Private 
individuals 
and 
stockholders and companies 
are profiting off of the fact that 
other people in society have 
been victimized by a crime, 
or victimized by the fact that 
their sentences are far too 
long 
and 
disproportionate 
to 
whatever 
they’ve 
been 
accused of doing,” Thompson 
said.
LSA senior Kate Westa, 
co-president of WeListen and 
former vice president of Young 
Americans for Freedom, said 
while she agrees there are 
many problems in the prison 
system, the solution is not to 
eliminate for-profit prisons. 
The market competition could 
actually help reduce repeated 
offenses, Westa said. 
“I think that it falls on 
common narrative that just 
because something is free 
market or for profit that it’s 
inherently bad,” Westa said. 

“I see the free market and an 
increase in competition often 
helping in a lot of ways that 
it otherwise isn’t when the 
government runs the entire 
show.”
Irwin said he’s noticed 
support from his colleagues 
in the state Senate and House 
of Representatives for private 
prisons, since they can create 
job opportunities in more 
rural areas of Michigan. 
“I think that the bill faces 
an uphill battle because many 
of the same legislators who 
are in the Senate now served 

with me in the House when we 
passed legislation to support 
private prisons,” Irwin said. 
Martha Abrams, an LSA 
senior 
studying 
history 
with an emphasis on crime 
and policing, acknowledged 
private prisons do need people 
to work in them, but she said 
because these facilities are not 
owned by the state, the level 
of training that employees 
are required to go through 
is minimal. That can lead to 
abuses of power against the 
prisoners, Abrams said.
“There’s 
an 
argument 
within Michigan right now, 
that 
there’s 
an 
economic 
benefit within the community 
because 
prisons 
create 
jobs for residents,” Abrams 
said. “The problem is that 
there’s a severe decrease in 
training for the people that 

go into these correctional 
facilities in sort of any field, 
so they’re not trained how 
to deal with people who are 
in a psychologically harmful 
environment.”
Thompson also said private 
prisons can lead to an increase 
in mass incarceration because 
a higher prison population 
will generate more profits. 
She said in order to keep the 
facilities full, prisoners will 
sometimes be moved away 
from their friends and family, 
which can have repercussions 
when it comes time for them 
to re-enter society. 
“The state will promise 
a private company that ‘X’ 
number of their beds will 
be full, so that incentivizes 
criminalization; 
it 

incentivizes keeping people in 
prison longer, even though all 
evidence suggests that that’s 
bad for the broader society,” 
Thompson said. 
Thompson said Irwin’s bill 
is important for Michigan 
because it will ensure that 
correctional 
facilities 
and 
criminal justice are kept in 
the hands of the government 
and out of the private sector.
“I think we have to have 
some 
serious 
legislative 
action 
on 
preventing 
any 
company 
who 
is 
in 
the 
business of locking people 
up from impacting laws that 
determine how long they’re 
locked up,” Thompson said. 
“And also, we should — as 
principle — outlaw anyone 
from being able to profit off of 
the misery of somebody else.”
Abrams agreed the bill is a 
step in the right direction, but 
thinks more reform is needed.
“For people who don’t know 
a lot about prison history and 
mass incarceration in general, 
it’s important to note that 
banning private prisons is 
certainly a step, but it can’t 
be the final one,” Abrams 
said. “It’s often referred to 
one of these red herrings 
legislatively, that, once it gets 
passed, it’s certainly great, 
but people will stop fighting 
as hard.”

PRISON
From Page 1

“Her rent there was probably 
$300 to $400, whereas I found a 
really, actually, pretty cheap place 
about three miles off campus — 
so I do have to commute a bit — 
and that’s still $800-something 
dollars. Most places downtown 
for just a room, it’s like $1,300. 
My sister’s older and she’s well-
established and even her mortgage 
on her house is less than my rent in 
Ann Arbor.”
Rall said high rent can push 
students into uncomfortable and 
unsafe living situations in an 
effort to save money. 
“I know of situations where 
two or three people will split one 
bedroom,” Rall said.”Which is 
definitely not legal — there’s a 
certain amount of square footage 
the city says each person must 
have. Even one of my friends was 
literally living in a closest — he 
was able to fit just his mattress in 
there — to save money on rent, and 
he was still paying around $600 
for a tiny closet.”
The increased rates are partly 
driven by increasing enrollment 
at 
the 
University. 
Students 
must choose between living in 
University 
dormitory 
housing 
or off-campus housing, which 
is often less expensive. Rall said 
luxury 
student 
housing 
also 
contributes to high rent, as other 
property management companies 
see 
students 
have 
a 
higher 
willingness to pay. 
“Luxury high-rise apartments 
might charge, let’s say $1,400 for 
one bedroom,” Rall said. “Then 
landlords see this and charge 
$1,000, because they know there 
will be students who maybe aren’t 
willing to pay $1,400 but will see 
$1,000 as a better deal.”
Pantaleo 
agreed, 
saying 
housing options are limited near 
campus since landlords are free 
to charge higher rent to wealthier 
students. 
“A large chunk of the student 
body comes from a lot of wealth,” 
she said. “So it’s not really an issue, 
their parents generally pay their 
rent or something … the places 
know that students need a place 
to live so they can charge as much 

as they want. And honestly their 
rates are pretty similar to how 
much they charge for dormitory 
housing. So it’s kind of like you’re 
trapped, you don’t have any other 
options.”
Jennifer Hall, director of the 
Ann Arbor Housing Commission, 
said the University should partner 
with the city to alleviate housing 
affordability issues for students. 
“The U-M owns a lot of land 
that could be developed as housing 
or mixed-use,” Hall wrote in an 
email interview. “The housing 
could be owned and managed 
by the U-M or the private sector. 
The housing could be dedicated to 
students and/or faculty and staff.”
Rall echoed Hall’s sentiments 
and 
said 
additional 
student 
housing from the University 
would help address increasing 
demand for affordable housing 
near campus. 
“I live in the Northwood 
apartments right now and I pay 
$650,” Rall said. “There’s one 
other person and we share a 
two bedroom unit. I think that’s 
pretty reasonable for Ann Arbor, 
and having more housing like 
this would be beneficial. There 
are so many more applicants to 
University housing than units 
available.”
Pantaleo 
suggested 
the 
University add or expand bus 
routes to make living off campus 
more accessible. Pantaleo, who 
lives about three miles off campus 
near the stadium, has to leave 
home 45 minutes before her 8:30 
a.m. class to be on time. 
“I drive to campus and then 
park, and then I take the bus 
to my class,” Pantaleo said. “If 
the University expanded its bus 
routes or maybe got more bus 
routes that went further and more 
often — because I have to take the 
city buses and the city buses are 
more unreliable, more so than 
Michigan buses - that would help 
in getting students to maybe live 
further off campus and be able to 
afford housing.” 
Hall said the Ann Arbor 
City Council and the Housing 
Commission have been assigned 
to analyze under-utilized city-
owned properties to see if they 
are ideal for affordable housing. 
Affordable housing is in demand 

in Ann Arbor. In November 2018 
more than 4,000 residents applied 
for 600 spots on an affordable 
housing waiting list. 
“That analysis is currently 
underway 
and 
we 
will 
be 
presenting our analysis to City 
Council in November,” Hall said. 
“The city, like the U-M, County 
and other public entities, own 
land that is underutilized and 
could be developed as housing, 
whether that is affordable or 
market rate housing. Any market 
rate housing that is developed 
that has pent-up demand, will 
have a positive impact on the 
housing market if the goal is to 
reduce increased housing costs.”
Hall 
said 
the 
increasing 
rental rates affect residents in 
more facets than housing. Local 
businesses have been negatively 
affected as well, which will 
in turn impact the Ann Arbor 
community. 
“The service industry is one of 
the back-bones of the economy 
and something that many people 
take for granted,” she said. 
“Local service industries such 
as restaurants, hotels, grocery 
stores, landscaping and the like 
are reporting that they are having 
a hard time filling positions 
because the people who work in 
those industries cannot afford 
to work in Ann Arbor due to the 
cost of the commute or literally 
the difficulty and time it takes 
to commute if they do not own a 
reliable vehicle.”
To Pantaleo, it is unreasonable 
that both landlords and the 
University expect students to 
pay high rent while in school. 
She believes the University has a 
responsibility to help make off-
campus housing more affordable 
and 
accessible 
for 
students, 
and hopes they will partner 
with the city and local property 
management companies to make 
housing more accessible. 
“I’m under a lot of scholarships 
for my tuition, but I don’t have 
anything for housing and that’s 
my biggest expense here,” she 
said. “The University should step 
in and talk to these rental places 
because it’s pretty outrageous for 
any place to expect students to pay 
$1,100 a month when in school.”

Additionally, House Bill 
4378, 
sponsored 
by 
Rep. 
Kristy 
Pagan, 
D-Canton., 
would 
ban 
disclosure 
of 
the names of people filing 
civil actions alleging sexual 
misconduct 
under 
public 
records laws.
Webber said she thought 
the bill would help protect 
the anonymity and wellbeing 
of survivors of sexual assault. 
“For a lot of victims, for 
a lot of survivors, it’s really 
hard to come forward and 
have a case,” Webber said. 
“It’s a really personal choice 
whether survivors choose to 
come forward and disclose 
to anyone or let alone law 
enforcement. 
It’s 
really 
important that we take down 
any barriers so that it’s easiest 
for the people who choose to 
disclose and file lawsuits so 
that they have the easiest and 
the least traumatic course of 
action to do so.”
These bills are a part of a 
larger package of bills formed 
in the last term to address 
sexual assault following the 
Nassar case. Many of the 
bills were approved by the 
legislature but did not clear 
the Senate before the end of 
session. 
“What was revealed by just 
simply following a case — and 

it’s not just the Nassar case, 
there’s other things that have 
come to light as well,” Rendon 
said. 
“Particularly, 
when 
you’re dealing with athletes 
and college campuses, it’s 
hard for some of these things 
to get overlooked as long as 
they did, and that’s why this 
legislation is designed to 
make sure this type of thing 
does not happen again.”
To become law, the bills 
still have to be approved by 
the Michigan Senate and 
signed by Whitmer.
State Rep. Yousef Rabhi, 
D-Ann Arbor, voted in favor 
of all three bills. He said 
he 
thought 
4378, 
which 
prohibits the publication of 
survivors’ names on public 
records, 
specifically 
was 
an important part of the 
package.
“A 
lot 
of 
times, 
unfortunately, 
these 
predators 
are 
the 
folks 
that are committing sexual 
misconduct or sexual assault 
are able to find records of 
who is filing these cases and 
can often either retaliate or 
continue to find information 
about them that can help 
them 
to 
be 
predatory,” 
Rabhi 
said. 
“And 
that’s 
unacceptable.”
The bills all had bipartisan 
support.
“I do think that we as a 
state should have had this 
on the books already,” Rabhi 
said. “But now we’re making 
that change, which I think is 

necessary, and will help to 
address future problems that 
arise.”
In an initial review of the 
bills, Rabhi said he noticed 
an 
existing 
statute 
that 
essentially already made it 
illegal for a doctor accused 
of sexual assault to hold a 
medical license. However, 
the 
statute 
assumed 
the 
assault to take place between 
a male doctor and a female 
patient, 
and 
included 
a 
marital loophole. He made 
amendments 
to 
the 
bill 
that 
made 
the 
language 
more gender neutral and 
eliminated 
the 
marital 
loophole. 
Rabhi also mentioned he 
had a bill in the package 
that 
would 
prevent 
K-12 
schools from reprimanding 
students who come forward 
to report instances of sexual 
misconduct or assault. 
In response to these bills, 
state Sen. Jeff Irwin wrote 
in an email to The Daily that 
work still needs to be done to 
improve laws against sexual 
assault. 
“We 
still 
need 
improvements to shore up 
the weaknesses in our laws 
against 
sexual 
assault,” 
Irwin wrote. “These bills are 
another step in that direction 
but they should be broadened 
to include other individuals 
in positions of trust and 
authority.”

“I think it’s nice to 
have an option,” Spencer 
said. “You’re taking your 
life in your hands. If you 
opt-out, it’s a risk.” 
 
The rest of the 
meeting was dedicated 
to discussing members’ 
experiences on several 
Senate 
Assembly 

committees. 
While 
some reported positive 
engagement 
with 
productive, 
organized 
committees, 
others 
expressed concern their 
committee 
experience 
was a waste of time. 
While acknowledging 
the 
time 
commitment 
required, 
Beatty 
emphasized 
the 
importance 
of 
SACUA 
members 
attending 
committee meetings. 

“I get it, it takes a lot of 
time … especially if you’re 
going to one that felt 
like ‘This is not the best 
use of my time,’” Beatty 
said. 
“I 
think 
there’s 
still 
something 
about 
making sure SACUA is at 
these meetings and has a 
presence, if we can.”
Nursing professor Ivo 
Dinov questioned if the 
Senate Assembly had too 
many committees.
“Quite 
frankly, 
I’m 

not 
convinced 
that 
SACUA 
needs 
twenty 
independently-run 
committees,” Dinov said. 
“Are these all faculty-
related business? Why 
can’t we handle it with 
less? It sounds like we’re 
all over the place, with 
overlaps and synergies. 
If there’s time later in 
the year, let’s reconsider 
that.”
Neil Marsh, a former 
SACUA 
chair 
and 

chemistry 
professor, 
noted 
there 
had 
to 
be a minimum of 11 
committees, 
as 
each 
University vice president 
was 
responsible 
for 
chairing 
one. 
Beatty 
proposed SACUA further 
examine 
the 
necessity 
of the nine additional 
committees at a later 
meeting. 
Members also reviewed 
each committee’s goals 
for the year. In this 

discussion, 
Classical 
Studies professor Sara 
Ahbel-Rappe emphasized 
she would like to see 
focus on the issue of free 
speech protections for 
faculty 
communicating 
about politics. 
“I 
do 
think 
these 
issues are problematic 
and dangerous,” Ahbel-
Rappe 
said. 
“As 
we 
move into a situation 
where they seem to be 
less democracy and less 

freedom, 
I 
think 
it’s 
important to clarify the 
legal protections that are 
in place for our faculty.”
SACUA 
then 
moved 
into 
closed 
executive 
session to discuss an 
update on a 5.09 matter, 
which is the University’s 
procedure for dismissal, 
demotion or termination 
of tenured faculty. 

We should — as 
principle — outlaw 
anyone from being 
able to profit off 
the misery of 
someone else.

customer 
service 
and 
administrative 
office 
at 
Maynard 
Street 
Parking 
Structure has a space shortage, 
only one toilet and doesn’t have 
a back exit, Pollay said. The 
proposal would have provided a 
new office for them as well.
Ann 
Arbor 
Mayor 
Christopher 
Taylor 
and 
Coucilmember 
Julie 
Grand, 
D-Ward 3, were the only two 
in favor of the proposal, while 
other council members voiced 
concerns about an increase in 
downtown parking and the cost 
of the proposal. Councilmember 
Ali 
Ramlawi, 
D-Ward 
5, 
expressed concerns over the 
price 
tag 
of 
the 
proposal. 
Ramlawi said the plan could 
prevent other developments.
“I’m just stunned by the 
cost estimates to build out on 
land that we already bought,” 
Ramlawi said. “It seems (like 
there’s) lot of uncertainty … 
(this proposal) could prevent us 
from doing a lot of things in the 
future if we wished to looking at 
our debt and rating.”
Councilmember Jane Lumm, 
I-Ward 
2, 
voiced 
similar 
concerns as Ramlawi. Lumm 
said the plan is two to three 
times typical construction cost, 
preferring a plan without the $4 
million expansion.
Lumm added DDA didn’t 

communicate well with the 
council about the addition of 
the $4 million project to the 
proposal. She described it as 
spontaneously appearing on the 
council’s agenda with “no heads 
up.”
“All of this happens with no 
discussion of council,” Lumm 
said. “I’m sorry, but this is 
a terrible process and just 
not how this partnership is 
supposed to work.”
Pollay said there are only 
about 
350 
surface 
parking 
spaces near the Ann Ashley 
structure. She said she feared 
these spots may be eliminated 
in the future when they’re 
redeveloped 
into 
projects 
with new residences. Pollay 
said the proposal would be an 
“investment in the future.”
“If 
you 
look 
around 
downtown, much is built out,” 
Pollay said. “The exception is 
the west side of downtown … our 
hope is to see the redevelopment 
of that portion of downtown. 
We hope by adding this public 
parking to this garage, we can 
see these parcels be put to much 
higher uses … it’s a chance to see 
those not used by cars.”
 In an email to The Daily, 
Grand 
wrote 
the 
proposal 
could have aided in meeting 
affordable housing goals. She 
added she voted for the proposal 
because 
it 
was 
thoroughly 
vetted by the DDA board and 
included needed community 
meeting space.
“This project would eliminate 
a 
commonly 
cited 
barrier, 

parking, to the re-development 
of surface parking lots within 
the downtown,” Grand wrote. 
“As we begin serious discussions 
regarding the potential of city-
owned properties, particularly 
as it relates to our affordable 
housing goals, having a plan in 
place to replace some of that 
parking makes sense.”
Hayner said the proposal 
wouldn’t help residents stay in 
the city and there are too many 
needs that should be addressed.
“Building housing for cars, 
not people? If we could bond 
$30 million on the DDA’s back 
to provide workforce housing 
in the downtown, I’d do that 
in a second before I build 
housing for cars,” Hayner said. 
“I wouldn’t support it in a 
modified format, either. I think 
it’s too much.”
Councilmember Jack Eaton, 
D-Ward 4, said he would like a 
new proposal “without luxury 
office space.” 
In 
response 
to 
these 
concerns, Lazarus wrote the 
debt service for the expansion 
and improvements would be 
paid from parking revenues. 
He added parking is needed for 
new development in the city.
“Additional 
parking 
is 
need(ed) 
to 
help 
support 
growth of the northeastern part 
of downtown (and) to make up 
for the future loss of surface 
parking as those properties are 
developed,” Lazarus wrote in 
an email to The Daily.

T

he 
University 
of 
Michigan is being sued 
right 
now. 
Thanks, 
Obama. 
Well, the actual story is a bit 
more complicated, but the gist 
of it is that a student is currently 
suing the University, and the 
court was seeking a deposition 
of University President Mark 
Schlissel up until late August. 
How did this happen? Well, 
it goes back a few years and it 
goes beyond Schlissel and the 
University. 
This entire saga is related 
to former President Barack 
Obama and a ‘Dear Colleague’ 
letter 
that 
his 
Department 
of Education issued back in 
2011. That letter changed the 
adjudication system for sexual 
assault on campus in three 
important 
ways. 
First, 
the 
standard of proof was dropped 
from “clear and convincing” to 
a “preponderance of evidence.” 
Secondly, the letter enabled 
double, triple and quadruple 
jeopardy 
by 
allowing 
the 
accusations to be tried again 
and again. Finally, the letter 
disallowed cross examination 
by the accuser. All three of these 
changes made the defendant’s 
life much more difficult and 
effectively 
turned 
Title 
IX 
hearings into kangaroo courts 
where guilt was determined by 
accusation or less. 
In 
addition 
to 
being 
personally odious, these policies 
may have run afoul of the law, 
and that brings us back to the 
University and Schlissel. The 
Detroit Free Press discussed 
the problems within the U-M 
system. A student was about 
to graduate and had been 
accepted to the U-M Graduate 
School for Engineering when 
he was accused of sexual 
assault. The University froze 
his transcripts prior to an 
investigation, 
which 
made 
moving on from the allegations 
nearly impossible. This action 
is antithetical to the principles 
of justice and due process and 
demonstrates the problem with 
the current system of Title 
IX policies relating to sexual 
assault. These were changed 

after 
the 
aforementioned 
‘Dear 
Colleague’ 
letter 
— 
namely, that they result in the 
violation of people’s rights and 
the destruction of their lives. 
This student was accused and 
afforded no chance to clear his 
name. The punishment was 
given to him before his trial, 
which represents a perversion 
of any justice system. After 
this, the student turned around 
and sued the school, which is 
when Judge Arthur Tarnow 
sought the deposition of the 
president. Schlissel and the 
school had previously been 
unsuccessful in avoiding this 
appearance in court, and on 
June 12, he won an appeal to 
delay his appearance. 

However, on Aug. 24, a 6th 
Circuit Court of Appeals panel 
blocked 
Schlissel’s 
required 
appearance. 
It 
is 
easy 
to 
understand why the judge would 
want to ask the president about 
policies governing the University, 
especially when those policies 
ignore due process, complicating 
these latest developments. It 
does lead one to think that, as 
The Michigan Daily Editorial 
Board argued in a previous piece, 
considering Schlissel oversees 
the policy, he has a duty to be 
able to explain it. If Schlissel 
both stood by the policy and felt 
that the students at his campus 
follow it, he should have taken 
the opportunity to make those 
statements under penalty of 
perjury. His unwillingness to do 
so suggests that he understands 
the current Title IX system is 
incongruous with a society that 
values rights for the accused as 

well as a fair trial.
Universities are supposed 
to expose students to new 
ways of thinking as well as 
foster respect for the tried 
and true methods of the past. 
When schools don’t do this 
and fail to foster freedom of 
speech (like at Middlebury 
College), or due process (like 
the Title IX provisions relating 
to sexual assault that existed 
between the Obama letter’s 
issuance and its withdrawal) or 
any other virtue, they do their 
name, their administrators and 
their students a tremendous 
disservice. 
Universities 
are 
supposed to prepare the leaders 
of tomorrow, and if Schlissel 
feels that they don’t deserve 
due process, he should have 
appeared before the court to say 
so. Seeing that he chose not to, 
he should reconsider whether 
the policy should exist. 
The road to hell is paved 
with 
good 
intentions 
and 
unfortunately, 
this 
is 
no 
exception. 
When 
Obama’s 
Department 
of 
Education 
issued the letter, they intended 
to address problems related 
to sexual assault on campus 
— and in no way do I mean 
to minimize the good faith 
behind that. When former 
Vice President Joe Biden went 
on his “It’s On Us” tour to 
promote the need for men on 
campus to take responsibility 
for their actions, I was in the 
audience and agreed that a 
culture change was needed. I 
disagree with him regarding 
what 
that 
change 
should 
be. There can be harsher 
punishments 
for 
sexual 
assault that do not trample 
on the rights of the accused, 
which is something that the 
Obama letter and subsequent 
guidance did. This type of 
policy 
should 
be 
pursued 
and the University president 
being unwilling (and possibly 
unable) to defend his existing 
one in court should serve as a 
warning to other Universities 
and their leaders.

ANIK JOSHI | COLUMN

Why the University is being sued — and who’s to blame

F

ormer Vice President Joe 
Biden is unfit to be the 
Democratic nominee, let 
alone president. He is a geriatric 
relic of a bygone era, a candidate 
that represents stagnancy in 
an age of political revolutions 
and upsets. Out of the many 
candidates on the Democratic 
stage, he is the second oldest 
only behind Sen. Bernie Sanders, 
Vt., and only by a single year. The 
ripe age of 76. Not even former 
President Barack Obama seemed 
to be keen on Biden running, 
reportedly telling his VP, “You 
don’t have to do this, Joe, you 
really 
don’t.” 
His 
opinions 
are antiquated, conflating the 
poor with Black people and the 
privileged with white people. 
He represents an old guard of 
Democrats, even older than 
the 
neoliberal 
Clinton-era 
troupe. My blathering about 
this particular baby boomer 
isn’t going to change minds, but 
maybe a look through his history 
will.
Biden started his career in 
the ‘70s dealing with the long-
contentious 
issue 
of 
forced 
integration in student busing, in 
which he backed the wrong side 
and adamantly stood against 
the Department of Education’s 
efforts to integrate segregated 
school districts. Fellow 2020 
candidate Sen. Kamala Harris, 
D-Calif. (who has had plenty of 
problematic positions dealing 
with racial inequality in the past 
herself), criticized Biden about 
this in the first presidential 
debate on June 27. Of course, 
he tried to defend himself 
with convoluted excuses, but 
the issue still stands. When 
it came to the fight for civil 
rights, Biden couldn’t sacrifice 
his constituents in Delaware 
to fight for what was right. 
In a 1975 interview with the 
People Paper, he said “I don’t 
feel responsible for the sins of 
my father and grandfather. I 
feel responsible for what the 
situation is today, for the sins of 
my own generation. And I’ll be 
damned if I feel responsible to 
pay for what happened 300 years 

ago,” seemingly ignorant of the 
concept of generational wealth. 
People seem to forget Biden 
was an architect of the war 
on drugs. His voting record 
concerning minimum sentencing 
and bills relating to drug related 
crimes has been horrendous. 

He was a member of the Senate 
Judiciary Committee from 1987 
to 1995, helping write many laws 
that led to a more punitive justice 
system. Said laws have laid waste 
to many already marginalized 
communities, putting people in 
prison unjustly and ruining lives 
as a consequence. In response to 
former President George H.W. 
Bush’s plan for decreasing drug 
use in 1989, Biden said that it 
“doesn’t include enough police 
officers to catch the violent 
thugs, not enough prosecutors to 
convict them, not enough judges 
to sentence them and not enough 
prison cells to put them away 
for a long time” — a statement 
that has aged like milk. The laws 
Biden helped write include the 
Violent Crime Control and Law 
Enforcement Act, which included 
(by his own admission) over 70 
new enhanced penalties and 
125,000 new prison cells.
Justice 
Brett 
Kavanaugh’s 
appointment to the Supreme 
Court re-opened old wounds 
for many, reminding Americans 
of 
Justice 
Clarence 
Thomas’ 
predicament 
with 
Anita 
Hill. 
Similar 
to 
Kavanaugh’s 
accusations of sexual assault, 
Thomas was accused of sexually 
harassing Hill, who worked under 
Thomas in the Department of 
Education. And in the hearing 
for Hill, many remember Biden 

being inconsiderate and unfair 
to the law professor. Biden even 
said in an interview a year later 
that he “erred in not attacking 
the attackers.” In recent years, 
however, Biden has claimed to 
apologize for her treatment. 
He claims to have had little 
power over the proceedings. But 
considering how his apologies 
have been conspicuously well- 
timed 
with 
his 
presidential 
campaign, I suspect hollow 
amends. With sexual harassment 
finally 
getting 
its 
due 
consideration in our culture, the 
light cast upon Biden from this 
folly is not a good one.
Joe Biden’s career is long, and 
with that comes the baggage 
of missed opportunities and 
grave mistakes. I don’t even 
have to mention his vote on 
the Iraq War to come up with a 
comprehensive list of things he 
was wrong about. Sure, people 
can change. I think that Biden is 
allowed to make amends with his 
past mistakes. But that doesn’t 
mean I think he can become 
worthy of the Oval Office. He 
is an antiquated man who has 
antiquated opinions, and that is 
not what America needs. 
In the 21st century, problems 
have arisen that need a new, 
fresh and unorthodox approach. 
I can’t think of a more traditional 
candidate than Joe Biden. The 
issue with tradition is that the 
establishment 
politics

Why we still need to fight for women’s liberation

SAM FOGEL | COLUMN

P

eople often argue that 
Western societies have 
made great leaps in the 
struggle for equality between 
men and women. Women now 
outwardly have the same legal 
rights as men, and because of 
Title VII, discrimination in the 
workplace based on gender is 
illegal. Nonetheless, the battle 
for achieving gender equality 
continues, 
leaving 
some 
to 
wonder why it is necessary. The 
standard that women strive to be 
equal to their traditionally male 
counterparts has always existed. 
It is an encapsulating and toxic 
ideal of the gender binary. It is 
important to consider reforming 
language as we know it in order to 
change societal thinking toward 
controversial topics. 
While it appears superficially 
that women have the same legal 
rights as men, there are still 
inherent biases present in both 
professional and private spheres. 
From medical environments to 
political stages, the systemic 
understanding of femininity and 
a gender binary creates heaps 
of issues. In Western culture, 
the concept of a gender binary 
exists almost everywhere and 
is especially apparent in the 
language we use, though one may 
easily pass over this construction 
if not actively searching for it. 
Detrimental 
binaries 
have 
been used for centuries, placing 
women as the inferior, subpart, 
second-in-line to the androgyny 
of society. In the Greek myth of 
Pandora, for instance, as well as 
many other classic works that 
frame 
modern 
psychologies, 
the text embodies phallocentric 
and 
androcentric 
anxieties 
of 
femininity, 
where 
women 
inherently lack something when 
compared to men. In “Pandora’s 
Tongues,” a feminist analysis 
essay of the Greek myth, Karin 
Littau boldly states that “it has 
always been the aim of Western 
philosophy 
to 
obliterate 
this 
foreignness or otherness in the 
quest for the return of the same.” 
In the long and slow march 
toward 
equality 
for 
women, 
the overbearing dominance of 

men throughout society’s most 
popular tales and history books 
has shrouded the importance of 
female and feminine characters. 
This has contributed to the idea 
that women are inferior, lacking, 
subordinate 
and 
unoriginal. 
The interpretations of classic 
literature 
over 
centuries 
has 
undoubtedly shaped the way 
Western civilization structures 
itself, and this is why analysis of 
our language now is so important 
when striving to fight the systemic 
oppression 
of 
women 
and 
confounding of gender binaries. 

In 
the 
past, 
the 
feminist 
movement 
has 
called 
for 
embracing 
“womanness” 
and 
attempting to reclaim femininity. 
Visibility 
has 
increased 
as 
women’s marches have occurred. 
T-shirts have been made with 
fronts 
espousing 
the 
words 
“Woman” or “I am woman” or 
“Human Woman.” However, with 
this trend of visibility, owning and 
wearing one own’s womanhood 
may only further solidify the 
construct of a gender binary. This 
isn’t to say that visibility of feminist 
movements is a bad or good thing. 
Perhaps this agenda to collectively 
claim womanhood can work to 
unify the movement by stirring 
up solidarity among its members. 
However, 
by 
emphasizing 
a 
homogenous 
“womanness” 
within the movement, we also 
diminish potential commonalities 
with those who do not necessarily 
identify with visibly extreme 
femininity. 
Equality for all human beings 
is incredibly important, but we 

need to consider just what 
equality 
means. 
Equality 
oftentimes neglects to address 
issues of diversity as well as 
failing to address differential 
impacts on individuals and 
populations. Using language 
such as “equality” means that 
women and femininity should 
strive to reach the standard of 
the male counterpart, which 
innately embodies a binary 
that men are inherently above 
women and women must work 
to lessen the space between 
the two. Using language such 
as “liberation” works to break 
down this system, as well as 
all 
other 
binate 
structures. 
The word liberation explicitly 
implies 
the 
dismemberment 
of complex systems to remove 
oppression 
of 
marginalized 
groups and individuals. 
Gender and women’s liberation 
are inherently different from 
gender and women’s equality. 
Women’s liberation encompasses 
the indiscriminate abolition of 
the classes of women and men and 
of the gender binary in general. 
The fight for gender and women’s 
equality today is thereby based on 
preserving the system of gender 
as we know it modernly — a 
system which serves to reinforce 
the social position of men as the 
standard to which we should 
aspire. Gender and women’s 
equality assumes gender as 
innate 
and 
the 
differences 
between genders as natural, 
whereas gender and women’s 
liberation negates wanting to 
be “just as good” as men. Using 
the term liberation instead of 
equality calls for freedom from 
the traditional gender binary, 
freedom from the suffocation 
of 
traditionally 
oppressive 
womanhood 
and 
freedom 
from the violence of manhood. 
Women’s liberation calls for 
nothing less than freedom from 
the burdensome gender binary, 
systemic discrimination and laws 
of difference that work to dictate 
our lives from birth to death.

Despite its herculean ambition, “It Chapter 
2” retains none of the contagious charm of the 
original. And make no mistake about it; this movie 
is ambitious. “Chapter 2” fires on every cylinder at 
its disposal, with twice the budget of “It”and an 
A-list adult cast as the aged-up Losers’ Club. Still, 
the original film’s quirky, light-hearted appeal 

is replaced by a tedious slog that manages to 
retroactively worsen the first movie. 
“Chapter 2” follows the seven members of 
the Losers’ Club 27 years after their traumatic 
experience with the hilarious demon clown 
Pennywise. When Mike (Isaiah Mustafa, “Horrible 
Bosses”) learns that murders are happening in 
Derry that mirror the pattern of those from his 
childhood, he gets the gang back together to end 
the clown for good. 
Unfortunately, the performances of the adult 

Losers’ Club are hit or miss. Jessica Chastain 
(“Molly’s Game”) and Bill Hader (“Inside Out”) 
excel as Beverly and Richie, bringing to life a 
layer of character development that felt genuinely 
special in relation to their younger counterparts, 
Sophia Lillis (“Sharp Objects”) and Finn Wolfhard 
(“Dog Days”). One notably disappointing cast 
member was James McAvoy (“Split”) as Bill, the 
leader of the Losers. Capable of an actor as he is, 
everything McAvoy does in “Chapter 2” feels like 
part of a different movie. It’s not just that he’s 
overacting — it feels like he’s overthinking, too. 
He exclaims painfully when other characters 
are speaking quietly, he yells in full sentences at 
his most intense. And neither the unintentional 
comedy of his performance nor the nuance of 
Chastain’s can distract from the general clunkiness 
of the script. 
In “Chapter 2,” there really is no such thing 
as subtlety. Every jump scare is more fantastical 
than the last, and after the 10th effects-driven set 
piece, the horror of it all becomes a drag too. The 
film trades the impact of its scares for a hollow 
goofiness. Where the first installment peppered 
in comedy to make the horror more digestible, 
“Chapter 2” finds its jokes in the absurdity of 
that horror. Muschietti’s use of CGI is partially to 
blame. The visual effects team was in the position 
of a kid in a candy store, encouraged to stretch 
their monsters to creative breaking points. And as 
much I can appreciate the film’s foray into realm 
of Tim Burton, there’s a point where zany just 
isn’t scary. Sure, there were shudders, jolts and 
occasional yelps in the audience, but there was 
mocking laughter equally present during the film’s 
gravest moments. 

Part of the charm of “It” was how breathless and 
contained it felt. The story happens almost entirely 
in the summer of 1989, nailing the identical vein of 
nostalgia on which the series “Strangers Things” 
thrives. Yet, for all the care the first chapter takes 
in immersing its audience in a single summer, 
“Chapter 2” is a temporal collage. Flashbacks 
are half-baked character notes, often occurring 

within the timeline of the first film. Moreover, 
where the perspective of “It” felt limited to only 
the characters we care about, “Chapter 2” detours 
wherever it pleases. Both of these choices make for 
a far more sprawling, far more exhausting journey. 
The contrast between the two halves of the 
story is a fascinating case in how the financial 
backing of a franchise affects its identity. “It” 
emits a vulnerability that goes beyond the 
adorable chemistry of its child actors. The first 
chapter feels genuine, investing its emotional core 
above everything else. It’s one of the reasons the 
movie reached so many audiences. The creative 
minds behind “Chapter 2” were aware of its likely 
success, discarding the finale they had intended — 
the one they seemed to promise us as an audience 
— for a numbingly zealous procedure, a mere 
performance of emotion.

A very honest, very true review of ‘It Chapter 2’

FILM REVIEW

How many releases these days 
have accompanying mobile games? 
In the early and mid 2010s, these 
types 
of 
things 
ran 
rampant, 
especially in the film industry — to 
build hype for a film, studios would 
commission a mobile game to be 
made to better explain said film. 
Blockbusters like “The Dark Knight 
Rises” and “Terminator: Genesys” 
both released mobile games in 
conjunction with each film’s release. 
Since then, however, mobile gaming 
has fizzled out and this trend has all 
but come to an end. Until it was time 
for Earthgang to release their latest 
album Mirrorland.
When 
Earthgang 
released 
Mirrorland, they also released a 
mobile game. How many other 
musicians have done this? The game, 
in which the goal is to defeat bad guys 
in levels themed after their latest 
albums from Rags to Mirrorland, 

won’t blow anyone’s hair back, but 
is enjoyable for a couple of minutes. 
The fact that the group decided to 
do this proves that members Olu and 
Wowgr8 aren’t interested in doing 
what every other rapper is doing. 
They aren’t just breaking the mold 

— they’re making a new one, and 
Mirrorland goes on to bolster this 
claim.
After 
countless 
delays 
and 
setbacks, Mirrorland is finally out 
this month, and it was well worth the 
wait. Its songs capture the energy 
and spirit from the group’s previous 
releases, but with a new level of 

polish and poise. Olu and especially 
Wowgr8 
display 
astronomical 
growth, 
in 
both 
their 
vocal 
performances and lyrical ability. On 
the album highlight, “Top Down,” the 
two are at their breeziest, absolutely 
floating over a bombastic, bass-
heavy beat produced by Childish 
Major. What is most noteworthy 
about this song and Mirrorland as a 
whole is the dichotomy between Olu 
and Wowgr8. Where Olu bounces, 
Wowgr8 slides. The two rap about 
similar things like running from the 
police and old flames, but hearing 
how differently each man attacks 
the same beat is nothing short of 
amazing. It’s like they’re two sides 
of the same coin.
Mirrorland’s first handful of songs 
are lighthearted and fun, but the 
album’s midsection begins to turn 
inward, beginning with “This Side,” 
a track that attempts to make sense 
of the group’s celebrity status and 
the woes that come with it. The men 

continue to build on these themes 
on “Swivel” through “Blue Moon,” 
climaxing at the fantastic “Tequila.” 
The song concerns the stresses of life 
and dealing with them with vices like 
tequila. It features a Latin-inspired 
beat and a guest verse from T-Pain 
in which he discusses his alcohol 
dependence and its downfalls.

After “Blue Moon,” the album 
begins to lull. The sounds get tired, 
and the songs begin to feel overly 
long, proven by the abundance of 
features that attempt to spice things 
up. “Stuck” is a stunning track, but at 
this point in the tracklist, its length 
and tempo make the album drag. 
However, closing song “Wings,” an 
uplifting cut about working hard and 
being proud of yourself, picks things 
back up and ends Mirrorland on a 
high note.
If anything, Mirrorland proves that 
Earthgang doesn’t care about their 
image. They want to do what they 
want to do, and it pays off. Wowgr8 
and Olu have crafted an album that 
showcases their outer and inner 
selves, often doing so in the same 
song. While the setbacks and delays 
were a nuisance, the album was well 
worth the wait because Earthgang 
continues eschew the mold and stay 
to true to exactly who they are.

Earthgang take hard look at
themselves on ‘Mirrorland’

MUSIC REVIEW

On a February day 32 years ago, a 
beam of glitter from space crashed into 
a home in El Salvador and Julio Torres 
was brought into existence. You might 
recognize the otherworldly comedian 
from his work as a writer on “Saturday 
Night Live,” his crafty witchiness 
starring in and co-creating HBO’s “Los 
Espookys” or his most recent HBO 
comedy special, “My Favorite Shapes by 
Julio Torres.” Torres’s comedy is unlike 
anything you have ever seen before 
in this time, dimension or universe. 
He spends his stand-up, for instance, 
mostly sitting down behind a playful 
conveyor belt in a silver jumpsuit and 
clear slippers a la one particularly 
forgetful Disney princess, highlighting 
as his special’s name promises — his 
favorite shapes. Torres disassembles 
the staleness of the classic stand-up 
routine and reconstructs it with grace 
and care. “My Favorite Shapes” is the 
kind of comedy I want injected into 
my veins or stirred into my coffee. It’s 
the kind of comedy you don’t know 
you need until you’ve had it. Have you 
ever experienced that magical moment 
where you go from having not seen your 
favorite movie to having seen it? It’s 
like you can’t imagine your life before 
and now your life is better after? That 
is what watching “My Favorite Shapes” 
for the first time feels like. 
Like most good things in this world, 
“My Favorite Shapes” was born at 
the Edinburgh Fringe Festival (see 
“Fleabag”). I think that one of the most 
admirable aspects about Julio Torres is 
his dedication to his art. He has a need 
to show us his shapes because it has to 

be done and he absolutely must do it. 
It reminds me of the famous Hillel the 
Elder quote (or what Ivanka Trump 
attributes to Emma Watson) — “If I am 
not for myself, then who will be for me? 
But when I am for myself, then what 
am “I”? And if not now, when?” But for 
Julio Torres: “If I don’t tell you about 
my favorite shapes, who will? And if 
not now, when?” He even explains this 
further through a phone call with his 
mother as special begins: “I need to 
show them. If I don’t, I don’t know that 

anybody else would.” Torres has to do 
this special and we need to hear him. 
“As I was preparing this show,” Torres 
says, “and deciding which shapes were 
going to go in which order, and I was 
weighing out the pros and cons of all of 
them. I thought ‘Oh, I’m sorry, is this one 
of the many good jobs that I’m stealing 
from hard-working Americans?’ Look, 
I’m just doing it because no one else was 
doing it, and it needed to be done.”
Within “My Favorite Shapes” Torres 
shows three shorts narrated by the 
likes of Lin Manuel Miranda, Ryan 
Gosling and Emma Stone. The shorts 
are dramatic and absurd, reminiscent 
of Torres’s writing for such “SNL” 
sketches as “Papyrus” and “Wells 
for Boys.” Miranda voices a cactus 
inhabiting the home of his deceased 
predecessor, Gosling tells the emotional 
story of one existential racing plastic 
penguin 
and 
Stone 
questions 
her 
purpose as a massive stiletto whose role 
is to display smaller shoes. Everything 
about Torres’s aesthetic is the opposite 
of what stand-up comedy has made 
itself into. In an interview with The 
Atlantic, Torres says of performing 
 
“It’s all drag, anyway.” “Comedians like 
the idea of presenting that they were 
just wandering down the street having 
their musings and then they wandered 
onto the stage,” Torres explains. He 
challenges the concept that comedians 
are average joes with witty stories — he 
is first and foremost a performer.
In an act of radical self-awareness 
Torres 
acknowledges 
the 
wacky 
uniqueness of his craft with careful 
consideration. “I have often been called 

too niche,” he declares at one point in 
his special as the camera zooms in on 
his fingers delicately placing a crystal 
into a miniature chair, “To which 
I’ll say, I have no idea what you could 
possibly be talking about.” Julio Torres 
is an avant-garde modernist of comedy, 
deconstructing 
and 
reconstructing 
humor like Marcel Duchamp did with 
the ready-made or Gertrude Stein with 
the novel. If the future of comedy looks 
like Julio Torres, I think we’re in good 
shape.

“I have felt so many times that the choice of this era is to be 
destroyed or to morally compromise ourselves in order to be 
functional — to be wrecked, or to be functional for reasons that 
contribute to the wreck,” Jia Tolentino writes in “The Story of a 
Generations in Seven Scams,” an essay from her debut book “Trick 
Mirror.” This is the kind of observation that sets “Trick Mirror” 
apart from other recent cultural commentaries. In a sentence, 
Tolentino names one of the defining dilemmas of modern life, and 
in doing so she offers her readers a double-edged sword: She sees 
us, but that means we are seen. 
Do you remember that awful weekend in the beginning of 
August, when Beto O’Rourke acknowledged that the shootings in El 
Paso and Ohio might have something to do with President Trump’s 
violent and racist rhetoric? “What the fuck? Hold on a second,” he 
said, when a journalist asked him what President Trump could do 
to make the situation better. Finally, he had lost it with the bullshit, 
and it was a painfully gratifying to see someone express the raw 
anger I felt. That’s what “Trick Mirror” feels like: Relief, because 
finally someone has taken up the Herculean task of articulating all 
the complication of being alive right now. 
In “Trick Mirror,” subtitled “Reflections on Self-Delusion,” 
Tolentino explores a number of topics: Feminism, politics, 
capitalism, religion, technology, marriage. The book is at turns biting 
and heartbreaking, and Tolentino never lets herself — or her reader 
— off the hook. In what appears to be her strongest essay, “The Story 
of a Generation in Seven Scams,” Tolentino meticulously describes 
how scamming has become an integral part of American life. 
Deception is woven into the fabric of American mythology. It’s the 
basis for nearly everything: Joanne the Scammer and President 
Trump, Elizabeth Holmes and LuLaRoe. Scamming, Tolentino 
argues, scales itself out from the personal to the structural and 
back again. We’re taught that scamming is how to get by. It’s how 
we play the system, but it’s also how we play ourselves. 
Tolentino zeroes in on a hard truth of capitalism in “Seven 
Scams”: In an economy like ours, trying to buy responsibly is nearly 

impossible. You buy something from Amazon — because it’s cheap, 
and you’re poor or you’re busy or you have a disability — and you’re 
directly contributing to a whole host of bad things that will soon 
befall another human being, another person who is also poor or 
busy or disabled. This is America, where we’re all screwing each 
other over in a million different ways. 
“Trick Mirror” doesn’t offer any answers to the question of 
how we might begin to break this cycle. Still, there’s something 
immensely satisfying in hearing the problem described so well. 
Tolentino is a superb writer; she manages to accurately characterize 
most complex social problems of our time with an ease that is 
unmatched. Best of all, she always implicates herself. The book 
is as much a reflection on culture as it is on her own relationship 
to it, and it’s a pleasure to read about how Tolentino herself has 
struggled to understand the world and her place in it. 
Her essay “We Come From Old Virginia,” about sexual 

assault on the University of Virginia’s campus, is an especially 
personal piece, since Tolentino attended the school as an 
undergraduate. She approaches the topic of the now-retracted 
Rolling Stone article, “A Rape on Campus,” with both empathy and 
anger. In the article, written by Sabrina Erdely, a woman (referred 
to as Jackie) describes a horrifying story of sexual assault. Much 
of the article was fabricated, however, and Erdely was sued for 
defamation.
“There’s a part of me that feels as if Jackie and Erdely 
inadvertently sentenced me to a life of writing about sexual violence 
— as if I learned to report on a subject so personal that it imprinted 
on me, as if I will always feel some irrational compulsion to try 
to undo or redeem two strangers’ mistakes,” Tolentino writes. 
Simultaneously, she understands something about the two women’s 
mistakes. Jackie reminds her of her time in the Peace Corps, about 
which she writes, “I felt, monstrously, that there was no boundary 
between my situation in the larger situation, between my injustices 
and the injustices everyone faced.” 
This dilemma is at the core of “Trick Mirror”: What is personal? 
What is political or structural or cultural, and to what extent can we 
hold ourselves and others responsible for the wrongdoing caused 
by our involvement in these larger systems? “Trick Mirror” avoids 
attempting to answer these questions and instead tries simply to 
articulate them. It’s clear upon reading “Trick Mirror” that part of 
the problem is that the questions themselves are so obscured. 
In this sense, “Trick Mirror” is more a work of philosophy and 
less a book of solutions. It left me with the feeling that simply 
understanding the many dilemmas of modern life would itself 
be revolutionary. After all the scamming, all the delusion and 
uncertainty, what we’re left with is the task of naming the vague, 
ever-present feeling of chaotic wrongdoing. Luckily, “Trick Mirror” 
isn’t a trick mirror at all. It shows us just as we are.

Anthony Jeselnik is a comedian who likes dark 
comedy. “Good Talk with Anthony Jeselnik,” a 
new Comedy Central series starring Jeselnik, 
appears to be his first mainstream foray into 
television, aside from a Netflix stand-up special 
called “Thoughts and Prayers,” which happens to 
be what one might call very dark. As is the case 
with comedy, it seems as though there’s something 
out there for everyone, and in order for something 
to be enjoyable, it really has to appeal to one’s sense 
of humor.

“Good Talk” is very much like a visual podcast. 
It isn’t necessarily an interview, per se, but it 
does have an interview-like quality mixed in 
with comedic games. Anthony Jeselnik sits in an 
unusually ornate room, adorned with low lighting, 
red drapes and bookshelves stocked with leather-
bound copies. Across the wooden table sits another 
comedian. In the series premiere, it’s Nick Kroll, 
known most notably for voicing Nick Birch, among 
other characters, on Netflix’s “Big Mouth.” The 
format is very straightforward. Jeselnik asks Kroll 
questions on topics ranging from Kroll’s career to 
the theme of his bar mitzvah. Kroll proceeds to 
answer the questions, and Jeselnik makes snide 
jokes — all in good humor — throughout Kroll’s 
interview. Peppered throughout are small stand-

ups clips, mainly used as jokes for what I believe is 
their ineffectiveness.
To be clear, I am not one for dark humor. I go 
to great lengths to seek out more wholesome 
humor that isn’t really at the expense of others. 
So Anthony Jeselnik and I probably would not be 
acquaintances. But he isn’t so bad here. “Thoughts 
and Prayers” is a genuinely terrifying special that 
neither begins nor ends well. Most of that is absent 
in “Good Talk,” even if he does poke a good amount 
of fun at Kroll. The dynamic can be very awkward 
at times because Kroll does his best to give very 
genuine answers to the questions Jeselnik asks, 
so — at least to me — Jeselnik’s jokes tend to feel 
misplaced.
The show also features quick interview games, 
like “Agree or Disagree” or everyone’s favorite, 
“Does This Describe an Actual Turtle or Ya Boy, 
Turtle, From ‘Entourage?’” The questions are more 
fun than anything, of course. Much like the rest of 
the show, if you respond well to Jeselnik’s style, 

you’ll probably get a kick out of it. Jeselnik delivers 
most of his jokes with the same even-paced, 
slightly-mocking voice. Often, the punchline is 
his knack for making genuine questions sound 
completely disingenuous.
“Good Talk” is ultimately bound to be compared 
to other successful comedian-centric interview 
shows, such as “Comedians in Cars Getting 
Coffee” or the very idiosyncratic “Between Two 
Ferns”; however, I think all these shows appeal 
to different tastes. Perhaps “Good Talk” offers 
something different from what these other shows 
can offer. Jeselnik’s style of humor is certainly 
different. If you’re looking for interviews that 
are more playful and less serious, you might get 
a kick out of “Good Talk.” Ultimately, I can’t say 
whether or not this show is good or bad, because 
I’m not a fan of Jeselnik’s humor. But if you’re a fan 
of Jeselnik, or enjoy the comedians who come on 
the show, you may find something worthwhile in 
“Good Talk.”

‘Good Talk’ is adequate, if that’s your sort of thing

Cross. Shot. Rebound. Goal.
After 327 minutes, Michigan 
finally ended its scoring drought 
when 
sophomore 
Raleigh 
Loughman ripped a shot into 
the upper corner 80 minutes 
into Sunday’s game. The play 
started 
when 
sophomore 
Meredith Haakenson received 
the ball from the corner, took 
a touch, turned and sent the 
ball towards the goal. The 
goalie dove and blocked the 
ball with an outstretched arm, 
but it rebounded right into 
Loughman’s path. A second later, 
the ball found the back of the net.
The crowd and the Wolverine 
sideline erupted.
Loughman’s goal propelled 
the Michigan women’s soccer 
team (3-2-0) to a 2-0 victory over 
Bowling Green (2-1-1) on Sunday. 
Just 
two 
minutes 
after 
Loughman’s goal, sophomore 
Skylar Anderson netted her first 
career goal on a header off a free 
kick from Loughman. Anderson 
disappeared into a sea of white 
as her teammates celebrated 
with her.
“I can’t even put words to it,” 
Anderson said. “It was amazing. 
The whole team was there and 
it was just great. There’s no 
words.”
Entering 
the 
game, 
the 
Wolverines 
were 
fueled 
by 
something stronger than their 
need to snap a two-game losing 
streak — it was Senior Day, and 
emotions were running high.
Despite the added motivation 
of Senior Day, the Michigan 
offense struggled to capitalize 
on opportunities early on. Every 
time a player touched the ball, 
she dribbled the ball down 
the field, crossed it in, and a 
teammate aimed to get a head or 
a foot on the ball. Rinse. Repeat. 
Chance after chance came and 
went, but through 45 minutes, 

the ball never found the net.
Opening the second half, 
Michigan searched for a spark. 
Thirty seconds after the whistle, 
freshman Lily Farkas took on a 
defender one-on-one, dribbled 
and rifled a shot off that sailed 
just over the crossbar. Minutes 
later, sophomore Emma Cooper 
dinged a shot off the crossbar 
too. The Wolverines were a 
different team.
“(I told them to) just keep 
moving the ball,” said Michigan 
coach Jennifer Klein. “Look to 
continue to build and get in and 
around the goal, and when we 
get in, just shoot.”
With the offense missing 
opportunities to find the back of 
the net, the Wolverine defense 
felt the pressure to shut down 
Bowling Green. It outmuscled, 

outworked and outperformed. 
Play after play, the defense 
swallowed every ball that came 
its way. When Michigan’s offense 
seemed to stall out, the defense 
stepped up to create chances and 
restart the attack. 
The 
core 
of 
Michigan’s 
defense are two veterans, senior 
Sura Yekka and junior Alia 
Martin. Every player that took 
either of them came up empty-
handed, and through 90 minutes, 
Bowling Green didn’t register a 
single shot on goal.
“One 
of 
the 
biggest 
improvements from last year 
to this year is our defensive 
organization 
and 
presence,” 
Klein said. “... We have to make 
sure that we’re really good at 
not giving the opponent a lot of 
chances in front of our net.”

MOLLY SHEA
Daily Sports Writer

Shortly 
after 
her 
team 
snapped a 327-minute scoreless 
streak en route to a 2-0 victory, 
Michigan coach Jennifer Klein 
stood on the pitch explaining 
what it took for the team to 
finally find the back of the net. 
It wasn’t that the link-up 
play was sloppy or that the 
team 
couldn’t 
march 
their 
way towards their opponent’s 
18-yard box. The offense’s lack 
of production boiled down to 
the failure to adhere to one 
simple phrase.
“If you wanna score goals,” 
Klein said “you gotta shoot the 
ball.”
The 
logic 
behind 
that 
statement 
is 
pretty 

straightforward; if you don’t 
shoot, you don’t score. Finally, 
Michigan 
adhered 
to 
that 
philosophy, a change that led to 
an unmistakable 
shift 
in 
the 
team’s 
win 
against Bowling 
Green. 
After 
taking 
only seven shots 
in a 1-0 loss 
against 
Notre 
Dame on Friday, 
the Wolverines 
more 
than 
doubled 
their 
shot total, pounding the net 
for an impressive 16 shots on 
Sunday. The end product took 
some time to show itself, but 
the team’s persistence paid off 
as they scored two goals in two 

minutes late in the second half.
The drought-breaking goal 
perfectly 
embodied 
Klein’s 
words as sophomore midfielder 
Raleigh 
Loughman 
immediately 
struck the ball 
when it bounced 
toward 
her 
right 
foot 
on 
a rebound. No 
hesitation. One 
touch, one shot, 
one goal.
Up 
until 
Loughman 
buried her shot in the 80th 
minute, the game had been full 
of frustration. Numerous shots 
fell right into Falcon’s freshman 
goalkeeper Becky Moss’s hands 
or careened off the post. It was 
clear, as Klein said, that the 
team had just been missing 
opportunities. 
Although 
the 
Wolverines 
dominated 
possession for the entirety of 
the match and had taken 13 
shots before hitting home, it felt 
like the streak may have been 
doomed to continue to at least 
337 minutes. 
That’s why the joy was 
palpable when Loughman’s shot 
flew into the net. It emanated 
from the huddle of players 
celebrating Loughman’s third 
goal of the season.
“There was definitely a sense 
of release,” Loughman said.
Now that Michigan finally 
hoisted the weight off their 
shoulders, all eyes are looking 
forward. Although Sunday was 
the team’s Senior Night, this is 
still very much the beginning of 
the season. The Wolverines still 
have all of Big Ten play ahead 
of them and would love the 327 
minutes 
before 
Loughman’s 
goal 
to 
become 
a 
distant 
memory.
“Hopefully that’s what they 
needed to keep moving forward 
in the season,” Klein said.

Close calls create frustration as 
Michigan falls to Washington, 1-0

Ultimately, 
it’s 
all 
about 
finishing.
The Michigan men’s soccer 
team learned that lesson Sunday 
evening in its 1-0 loss to No. 13 
Washington. 
Despite 
plenty 
of close calls and solid scoring 
opportunities, the Wolverines 
were unable to break through 
when it mattered.
Michigan 
started 
off 
confidently 
and 
maintained 
control of play for most of the 
first 
half. 
The 
Wolverines’ 
defense consistently frustrated 
Washington’s 
attack 
and 
recovered the ball when they 
needed to.
“I don’t think we make many 
mistakes 
defensively,” 
said 
Michigan coach Chaka Daley. 
“We really only made one this 
evening, and that’s when they 
scored.”
This defensive strength was 
mirrored by the Huskies’ on the 
other half of the field, though, 
and Michigan often had trouble 
converting 
possessions 
into 
scoring 
opportunities. 
When 
those rare chances did come, the 
Wolverines failed to connect. 
Early in the second half, 
Michigan’s 
attack 
proved 
to be much more assertive. 
For a moment, it seemed the 
Wolverines would break the 
gridlock 
when 
freshman 
forward Christian Pulselli stole 
the ball and fed it to sophomore 
forward Derick Broche in the 
middle of the box. As the crowd 
roared in anticipation, the ball 
rolled 
just 
beyond 
Broche’s 
control into the keeper’s hands. 
Yet another scoring opportunity 
fizzled away. 
“I thought we were quite 
dangerous and had them on the 
back foot a lot in the second 
half,” Daley said. “We were 
finally able to move into the final 
third in possession — but after 
that it’s a matter of making the 
right choice and picking out the 
right guys. We have some new 
personalities so figuring that 

out is where we struggled a little 
bit.”
In the 50th minute, the 
Huskies were the ones who 
were able to open up the scoring. 
After a combination play and 
missed slide tackle, Washington 
defender Kasey French took 
control of a cross and smashed 
the ball past Michigan senior 
keeper Andrew Verdi’s hands 
into the top left corner.
This momentary lapse from 
an 
otherwise-poised 
defense 
would come to define the rest of 
the game.
A 
remarkable 
series 
of 
chances as the half progressed 
showed the Wolverines had 
figured out how to set up 
chances for themselves against 
the Husky defense. But an air 
of frustration fell over the team 
as successive chances in the box 
ended without success.
“At halftime we discussed 
how we can keep them pinned in 
and also not allow them to play 
as much as they did in the first 
half where they kind of rolled 
out and played,” Daley said. “It 
was a positive tactic for us but 
there were a lot of near misses — 
they made a great save or a shot 
hit the post or the crossbar.”
Indeed, shot after shot from 
Michigan missed by inches or 
was barely deflected. Notably, 
junior forward Umar Farouk 
Osman fired the ball toward 

the goal from the middle of the 
box in the 64th minute, but it 
flew past the keeper’s hands and 
bounced off the crossbar back 
into the box where Osman was 
unable to recreate the shot. 
Hallahan 
came 
similarly 
close in the 56th minute. He 
regained 
control 
after 
the 
Huskies initially cleared away 
Michigan’s corner kick and fired 
a shot past Washington’s diving 
keeper, but the ball bounced off 
the post.
Washington’s 
defense 
remained poised and stopped 
the persistent Wolverine attack 
in its tracks. Michigan’s defense, 
meanwhile, returned to form for 
the remainder of the game and 
denied Washington any chance 
to extend their lead. 
“We owned every big moment 
tonight and that’s what we 
were trying to educate our guys 
about,” Daley said. “We own 
tonight’s result and we owned 
those moments — the question is 
how we can take more advantage 
of them and put good teams like 
Washington away.
“It’s a big step forward in 
belief for the coaching staff — we 
can really compete if we can win 
the big moments.”
That was of little consolation 
to the Wolverines and their fans. 
Despite a wealth of close calls 
and near misses, salvation by an 
equalizer was out of reach.

How ‘M’ approached overtime

If there’s one team you really 
don’t want to face in overtime, 
it’s probably Army.
Like any team that runs the 
triple option, the Black Knights 
thrive on a short field, chipping 
away at the green turf until 
there’s no more empty space.
The Michigan football team 
saw firsthand what Army could 
do with such an advantage in 
the first half Saturday after two 
fumbles on two separate drives 
led to two touchdowns. But the 
Black Knights started their 
first three drives after halftime 
from their own 35, 25 and 23 
yard lines and came up empty 
each time.
Overtime, though? That’s a 
whole different animal. Each 
team gets one drive from 
the 25-yard line. Defensive 
coordinator Don Brown knew 
that meant an Army advantage.
“You don’t want to get into 
those scenarios, you really 
don’t,” Brown said Monday. 
“Because the short field is their 
friend.”
To 
combat 
the 
high 
probability of a Black Knights 
score, 
offensive 
coordinator 
Josh Gattis had a plan: an 
aggressive 
approach 
that 
attacked each possession with 
urgency.
It was the same mentality 
he’d used when calling plays in 
the fourth quarter, including 
once when he passed up a 
potential field goal only to get 
stuffed on fourth-and-2. Then, 
Gattis had wanted to run out 
the clock and end the game on 
Michigan’s 
terms, 
knowing 
that the more time Army had, 
the more likely they’d get close 
enough for a field goal. Those 
calls hadn’t worked then — 
and in fact, probably got the 
Wolverines to overtime in the 
first place. Neither team scored 
in the fourth quarter and a 
made kick could’ve won the 
game in regulation.
But Gattis was right about 
one thing on the second fourth 
down. The attempt ate up 

enough clock that Army could 
only get to Michigan’s 33-yard 
line 
before 
time 
expired, 
forcing 
the 
Black 
Knights 
into a 50-yard attempt that 
was decidedly out of range for 
kicker Cole Talley.
So the Wolverines went to 
overtime and again took the 
aggressive approach with them.
“Win the game,” said junior 
center Cesar Ruiz. “That really 
was just it. Knuckle up and win 
the game. This is it right here.”
Michigan’s defense got to 
work, methodically forcing a 
third-and-4, but senior viper 
Khaleke 
Hudson 
lined 
up 
offsides. The five-yard penalty 
resulted in a first down for 
Army. Two more 
runs 
and 
the 
Black 
Knights 
were in the end 
zone.
“ 
‘Would 
you please look 
down the line of 
scrimmage?’ 
” 
Brown recalled 
thinking. 
“ 
‘You’re offsides, 
dude.’ I mean, 
can you believe that? But we 
lined up offsides on a big play 
and it hurt us.”
Knowing 
they 
needed 
a 
touchdown, the Wolverines got 
to work. On third-and-6, senior 
quarterback 
Shea 
Patterson 
found sophomore wide receiver 
Ronnie Bell for a first down, 
then a pass interference on 
the next play moved the ball 
to the 3-yard line. From there, 
freshman running back Zach 
Charbonnet punched it in.
Michigan could’ve chosen to 
take matters into its own hands 
right there, but going for two 
was never really a consideration. 
The same analytics that both 
coach Jim Harbaugh and Gattis 
pointed to as influencing the 
fourth-down decisions earlier 
said that a kick was the better 
option — not to mention that 
the Wolverines had tried a 
two-point conversion against 
Middle Tennessee that failed. 
So Jake Moody trotted out 
and sent the game to a second 

overtime.
“Kick it and obviously flip it 
back around and be on offense,” 
Gattis said. “And we felt really 
good about where our defense 
was playing and how well our 
defense was playing. … Getting 
into the second overtime, the 
juices kinda get going a little 
bit more and we wanted to ride 
that wave from where our team 
was.”
But in the second overtime, 
that wave crashed back to 
shore. Patterson had three 
straight incompletions — an 
overthrow to a wide-open Nico 
Collins in the endzone, a pass 
that redshirt sophomore wide 
receiver Tarik Black dropped 
and 
another 
attempt to Black 
that 
wasn’t 
really close. So 
the Wolverines 
settled 
for 
a 
field goal.
It was up to 
the defense, and 
as 
Michigan’s 
season hung in 
the balance, it 
came 
up 
big, 
holding Army to just a two-yard 
run on first down, making a 
tackle-for-loss on second down 
and then, finally, strip-sacking 
the quarterback on third down 
and recovering the fumble.
“When they jumped off the 

bench at the end, you kinda felt 
like our energy is right,” Brown 
said. “We’re going to have a 
chance to get out of here. And 
you saw it. You saw the three 
plays.”
On 
the 
play, 
sophomore 
defensive 
end 
Aidan 
Hutchinson only remembers 
hitting the quarterback. He 
doesn’t remember exactly how 
sophomore defensive end Kwity 
Paye fell on the ball, but he knew 
the game was over and began 
to run and jump and celebrate 
as the team streamed onto the 
field. Beating a team like the 
Black Knights in overtime isn’t 
for the faint of heart.
It’s no wonder Harbaugh 
gave 
Hutchinson 
a 
hug 
afterwards.

Panic Meter: How worried should you be about the Wolverines?

If there’s ever been a better 
timed week three bye, you’d be 
hard-pressed to find it.
By the skin of its teeth, the 
Michigan football team emerged 
victorious on Saturday against 
Army. That has done little to 
deter criticism in its aftermath. 
The Wolverines enter their first 
of two bye weeks, with more 
questions than answers. 
How much of that cynicism 
is warranted? Let the official 
Michigan Daily Panic Meter 
assess those worries.
Offensive line: 6.3/10
Facing a team without a 
defensive player over 300 pounds, 
and only a handful over 250, 
Michigan’s offensive line allowed 
pressure in pass protection and 
got pushed around at times in 
run blocking. The Wolverines 
ran the ball 45 times (more on 
that later) at just 2.4 yards per 
carry including sacks, 3.3 yards 
per carry excluding them. It was 
an alarming figure against a team 
Michigan’s offensive line, frankly, 
should have mauled at will.
Ryan Hayes, in particular, 
struggled in pass protection after 
a laudatory week for the redshirt 
freshman. 
After 
the 
game, 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
said 2018 first team All-Big Ten 
left tackle Jon Runyan Jr. appears 
set to return against Wisconsin. 
That would be a boon.
“Jon was just really on the 
verge of being ready to play,” 
Harbaugh said. “He could have 
played … He looked good in 
practice, but we just felt like we 
would give him another week to 
make sure this isn’t something 
that’s a season ongoing problem.”
Is he going to play in two 
weeks?

“Can I say that now? Most 
likely,” he added.
Where 
does 
that 
leave 
everything, two weeks into a year 
that portended the offensive line 
as an offensive pillar?
Wisconsin will be the ultimate 
test here. If Runyan returns to 
stabilize the left side and the 
interior cuts down on some 
miscues, this ship could find 
its level pretty quickly. But the 
offensive line being a strength 
seemed a foregone conclusion 
two weeks ago. If it ends up a 
liability — or even merely average 
— that severely hampers the 
ceiling of a unit that needs to be 
one of the nation’s best if it wants 
to win the Big Ten.
Defense: 3.8/10
The 
sheer 
volume 
might 
have been overwhelming, but 
Michigan held Army’s triple-
option attack to 3.8 yards per 
carry on the day. And most 
importantly, it came up with 
plays when it needed to. Lavert 
Hill snagged an interception near 
the goal line at the end of the first 
half, and Kwity Paye and Aidan 
Hutchinson teamed up for the 
play of the afternoon — forcing a 
fumble in overtime to narrowly 
escape.
“That was a gem of a defensive 
performance, no doubt about it,” 
Harbaugh said after the game. 
“You can talk about the last play, 
that last defensive series, just the 
entire football game. We made 
mistakes offensively; penalties, 
turnovers 
and 
turnovers 
on 
downs that the defense was not 
in the best position.”
While much of the concerns 
feel warped into the offensive 
struggles, there are still reasons 
to be (slightly) concerned about 
this defense.
An upper-echelon Big Ten 
defensive line should be able 

to win at the line of scrimmage 
against Army 10 out of 10 times. At 
times, the Wolverines struggled 
to do so. Some of that is anchored 
in the lack of depth along 
the interior. With Wisconsin 
looming, finding a run defense 
capable of holding up against 
maybe the nation’s most bruising 
rushing attack is priority No. 1, 
2 and 3. It is tantamount to any 
hope Michigan has of emerging 
from Madison victorious. We’ll 
soon learn if the Wolverines have 
the personnel to do so.
Quarterbacks: 3.0/10
Read 
Ethan 
Sears’ 
SportsMonday column.
Play-calling: 7.8/10
Run/pass 
play-calling 
distribution is often overblown. 
Game context dictates those 
decisions more than anything 

else, and so, deducing concerns 
about play-calling down to the 
45/31 split we saw on Saturday 
misses the point.
But 
when 
a 
reporter 
approached Ben Bredeson and 
asked 
where 
the 
“speed 
in 
space” was, it was an entirely 
valid question (though not really 
Bredeson’s domain). It wasn’t 
that Michigan ran the ball 45 
times yesterday, it was that 
each one seemed to be an inside 
zone without any legitimate 
quarterback read. It wasn’t that 
the Wolverines didn’t run as 
many RPOs, it was that their best 
offensive weapon, Nico Collins, 
had three targets in a close game 
in overtime.
Far be it from us to understand 
all the nuance involved in play-
calling, there are clear tenets of 

what the Wolverines are trying 
to do missing from the field. They 
are not getting the ball to their 
best players. They are not finding 
creative ways to utilize talent. 
And they are not getting premier 
speed in space.
Until (if?) that changes, this 
offense will be handicapped by 
itself.
EVERYTHING?!?!?!: 5/10
To be fair, had Army’s field 
goal at the end of regulation 
drifted inches further and left, 
the entire tone of this story would 
be cranked up several notches. 
A loss to Army ostensibly ruins 
Michigan’s most lofty goal, the 
College Football Playoff. A near-
loss to Army obviously doesn’t. 
But the concerns that put 
Michigan in such a tenuous 
position 
don’t 
seem 
easily 

amenable. And that’s where the 
panic should concentrate. The 
presumptive returns of Runyan 
and Donovan Peoples-Jones will 
help, no doubt. That will not fix 
the depth issues on the defense. 
It will not make the scheme more 
assured nor the play-calling less 
aggravating. It might help Shea 
Patterson take care of the ball 
and play more efficiently, but it 
will not be a magic bullet.
We are two weeks into the 
season, and the Wolverines have 
performed significantly worse 
than expectations. Given the 
nature of their opponents, they 
can afford to use those two games 
as wake-up calls to help right the 
ship without a season-altering 
loss. But if it sustains beyond this 
bye week, that record won’t stay 
unscathed much longer.

Defensive linemen Aidan Hutchinson (second to right) was one of two players who helped force a fumble to clinch Michigan’s win on Saturday afternoon.

Gattis seeking to eliminate errors

It’s unlikely Josh Gattis ever 
tried to envision what his first 
in-season 
press 
conference 
as 
Michigan’s 
offensive 
coordinator would look like 
because, frankly, he has better 
things to do. But if he did, 
he 
probably 
didn’t 
picture 
reporters trying their best to 
play Operation, guessing at 
potential issues to try and find 
an answer for why his offense 
hasn’t worked.
But the Wolverines enter 
their bye week with no topic of 
greater importance. They will 
likely spend the 11 days before 
a trip to Wisconsin doing 
the same thing — watching, 
diagnosing, 
fixing. 
If 
they 
don’t, their season will hang in 
the balance sooner rather than 
later.
Through two games, senior 
quarterback Shea Patterson is 
averaging 7.1 yards per passing 
attempt, down from 8.0 last 
year. Michigan’s run game is 
averaging 3.8 yards per attempt, 
down from 4.8 last year. Those 
two games came against Middle 
Tennessee State and Army, and 
to put it kindly, neither defense 

is 
representative 
of 
what 
Michigan will see in Madison, 
or throughout the Big Ten 
season.
To 
hear 
Gattis, 
and 
Michigan’s players, tell it, the 
problem lies in self-inflicted 
errors. The system is working, 
but the execution is not yet 
there.
“When you look at it over 
the past two games, we got 
seven turnovers, we got seven 
fumbles, we have 10 penalties 
and then we also have seven 
drops,” Gattis said. “And so, you 
go back and you look at all those 
plays in critical situations, 
they’re killing us now. 
“There’s 
been 
a 
lot 
of 
positives over the past few 
games. We’ve ran 160 plays, 
we’ve had 17 explosives and 
we’ve had a number of different 
other explosive opportunities 
that we’ve just missed, whether 
it’s overthrown balls, dropped 
balls, guys wide open to create 
some big opportunities. We’ve 
missed about six of those. We 
just gotta get our timing down 
in every phase and every asset 
of our operation in offense.”
There’s truth in this — 
the 
conversation 
would 
be 
different if Michigan hadn’t 

lost five fumbles in two games. 
There’s no inherent correlation 
between a spread offense and a 
lack of ball security. Ditto for 
penalties and drops. It’s not the 
whole picture though.
When an offense predicated 
on forcing players into conflict 
— be it on zone reads or run-
pass 
options 
— 
becomes 
predictable, the ball getting 
handed off 37 times and the 
quarterback rarely keeping the 
ball on options, it won’t work.
“Everything that we do has 
some level of read, whether it’s 
an RPO read or quarterback 
read run,” Gattis said, and if 
that’s true, the Wolverines don’t 
seem to be taking advantage.
Maybe that has to do with 
Patterson’s 
oblique 
injury, 
which Gattis said has been 
an issue in both games. But 
the offensive coordinator also 
seemed to believe it had little 
effect on his quarterback’s 
play. 
The 
reads 
are 
more 
complex than they seem, he 
said, particularly against a 
team that might be playing 
defenders wide up the field, 
cutting off a potential run by 
the quarterback.
“He 
made 
some 
good 
decisions in there,” Gattis said. 
“There were some decisions, 
obviously, that you wish you 
could have back, but you gotta 
continue 
to 
correct 
those 
decisions and get better from 
them.”
Gattis’ message — fix the 
obvious errors and everything 
else will fall into place — 
holds 
true. 
Center 
Cesar 
Ruiz searched around for the 
right 
phrasing 
to 
describe 
the struggles and never quite 
found it. “I wouldn’t call them 
growing pains,” he said, “but 
there’s some things we got to 
— some things, we understand 
the offense. We understand 
everything. … Every game’s not 
going to be perfect.”
Right now, mistakes or not, 
the Wolverines must find a way 
to run the offense as Gattis 
described it in the spring. 
Option-heavy, 
fast, 
keeping 
defenses off-balance and above 
all, modern.
“Obviously is there areas 
and room for growth? Yes,” 
Gattis said. “Like I said, the 
mistakes and everything. But 
I think ultimately, it’s my job 
to put them in a position to be 
successful.”
