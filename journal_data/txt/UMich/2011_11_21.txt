LGBT activists
share experiences
during anniversary
events on campus
By DANA DEL VECCHIO

For theDaily
and Daily Staff Reporter
After working for the Univer-
sity as an athletic trainer for the
football team from 1968 to 1979,
Lindsy McLean joined the San
Francisco 49ers as a trainer. But
for the 24 years that McLean
worked with the team, he stalled
coming out to his professional
community to keep his personal
life and career separate.
During a roundtable discus-
sion on Friday as part of the
Spectrum Center's 40th anni-
versary events,. McLean talked
about his experience coming out
and the discrimination he faced
from people in the industry.
After being verbally harassed at
work, McLean found solace at a
church that welcomed the gay
community.
"I'd leave Candlestick Park

and go to church," McLean said.
"I think the fact that I had an
outlet there, it really helped me."
To overcome his difficulties
and serve as a role model for
other gay people, McLean looked
to others for support including
author Betty Berzon and her
book "Setting Them Straight."
"I thought, what do I have to
lose?" he said. "Maybe I could
help a few others inatheir strug-
gles against hate and lack of
acceptance by coming out."
McLean was recognized by
the sports community in an
ESPN Magazine article in 2004
that illustrated his efforts to
achieve increased tolerance for
LGBT people in the realm of
sports.
During another discussion
on Friday celebrating the Spec-
trum Center's mission to pro-
mote awareness of LGBT issues
and tolerance on campus, phi-
lanthropist and technology
entrepreneur David Bohnett dis-
cussed his foundation, the David
Bohnett Foundation - a non-
profit, grant-making organiza-
tion that aims to improve society
through social activism.

back jersey covered in
grass stains and dirt,
Jordan Kovacs stood in a trailer
home outside Spartan Stadium.
He was beaten and bruised, try-
ing to put the Michigan football
team's fourth straight loss to
the rival Spartans into words.
Thirty or so reporters
crammed into the trailer, as
cameras and bright lights
shined in Kovacs's face. Every
question stung, each harder to
answer than the last.

But
Kovacs
stood at that
podium and i
spoke the,
truth.
"They
were defi- KEVIN
nitely more RAFTERY
physical," RATERY_
the redshirt
junior safety
said. "They pounded us. They
beat us up."
That's like Batman compli-

menting the Joker - it's not
easy. But Kovacs knew his team
was beaten, plain and simple,
and he wasn't going to sugar-
coat the loss.
The questions kept coming.
Kovacs answered each one as
honestly as he could, keeping
his head up throughout.
"I think it would be easy to
say that this is the same Michi-
gan team from the last two
years," he said. "ButI have no
doubt in my mind that we're
not."

Kovacs spoke with confi-
dence, but Michigan fans still
doubted.
Doubt no more. On Saturday,
Kovacs and the 20th-ranked
Wolverines proved this year is
different.
And they proved it by doing
to No. 17 Nebraska exactly what
the Spartans did to them.
"We knew that (Nebraska
was) gonna be a physical team
and that the tougher team, the
more physical team, was gonna

Residential College to move

0 Quad groups
prepare for move
By TAYLOR WIZNER
Daily StaffReporter
After spending the last 44
years in East Quad Residence
Hall, the Residential College
will have a new home next year.
The Residential College,
currently located in East Quad

Residence Hall, will temporar-
ily move to West Quad Resi-
dence Hall next fall while East
Quad undergoes a year of major
renovations, according to Uni-
versity Housing spokesman
Peter Logan. The Health Sci-
ences Scholars Program, also
currently housed in East Quad,
will be re-located to Couzens
Residence Hall.
While West Quad offers the
same residential accommoda-
tions as East Quad, it does not
have the classrooms and offices
needed by the RC, according to
RC Director Angela Dillard. To

remedy the lack of classrooms,
the RC is looking into reserv-
ing classrooms in the Dennison
Building. This will cover most
of the community's needs, but
it will also use some spaces on
North Campus and in Alice
Lloyd Residence Hall, the Bur-
ton Tower and the University
of Michigan Museum of Art.
The dispersal of classes
across campus will be a big
change to the RC's structure.
Dillard wrote in an e-mail
interview that the RC does not
anticipate the relocation hav-

With his parents standing
proudly behind him on stage,
Chris Armstrong, the first openly
gay Michigan Student Assembly
president, announced the Chris

Armstrong Scholarship Fund on
Friday at the Spectrum Center's
40th anniversary Pink Carpet
Gala Event.
The scholarship - which has
an initial endowment of $100,000
- is intended for incoming fresh-
men, Armstrong told The Michi-
gan Daily. In his speech to the
crowd of students, alumni, mem-
bers of the LGBT community and
allies at Rackham Auditorium,
Armstrong said the scholarship
- which is funded by his par-

ent - is meant to give students
who have been bullied because
of their sexual orientation the
opportunity to attend the Uni-

portive community.
"My parents and I decided to
start a scholarship for students
who've been bullied, to come to
the University of Michigan ... and
show students how it gets better,"
Armstrong said.

Chevron takes blame for
Brazilian coast oil spil

Officials estimate
more than 110,000
gallons of oil spilled
SAO PAULO (AP) - An ongo-
ing oil spill off the Brazilian
coast occurred because Chev-
ron underestimated the pres-
sure in an underwater reservoir,
the head of the company's Brazil
operations said yesterday.
George Buck, chief operating
officer for the Brazilian division
of the San Ramon, California-
based company, told foreignjour-
nalists that Chevron "takes full
responsibility for this incident,"
and that "any oil on the surface
of the ocean is unacceptable to
Chevron."
But Buck rejected accusa-

tions the company did not notify
authorities quickly enough after
the leak was detected and that it
did not properly manage cleanup
operations.
Chevron was drilling an
appraisal well about 230 miles
(370 kilometers) off the north-
eastern coast of Rio de Janeiro
when the leak began Nov.7.
The drilling fluid that is
pumped down the center of
the drill as it works, lubricat-
ing and stabilizing the pressure
of the bore hole, was not heavy
enough to counter the pressure
coming from the oil reservoir,
Buck said.
That caused crude to rush
upward and eventually escape
through a breach inthe bore hole
and leak into the surrounding
seabed.

The oil then made its way to
the ocean floor and has since
leaked through at least seven nar-
row fissures, all within 160 feet
(50 meters) of the well head on
the ocean floor, Buck said.
Brazil's National Petroleum
Agency has said it's possible more
than 110,000 gallons of oil have
spilled into the Atlantic Ocean.
Buck would not provide an esti-
mate on the total size of the leak,
but said the agency figure was "in
the ballpark."
He added that the slick cur-
rently contains about 756 gallons
(2,860 liters) of oil, a figure not
confirmed by Brazilian regula-
tors, though they have said it has
been significantly reduced since
Chevron successfully carried out
the first stage of capping the well
Thursday.

McDonald's drops Minn. egg
supplier over cruelty charges

FDA cites 'serious
violations' at five
Sparboe Farms
facilities
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -
McDonald's Corp. said Friday it
has dropped a Minnesota-based
egg supplier after an animal
rights group released an under-
cover video of operations at the
egg producer's farms in three
states.
The video by Mercy for Ani-
mals shows what the group calls
animal cruelty at five Sparboe
Farms facilities in Iowa, Min-
nesota and Colorado. Its images
include a worker swinging a bird
around by its feet, hens packed
into cramped cages, male chicks
being tossed into plastic bags to
suffocate and workers cutting
off the tips of chick's beaks.

"The behavior on tape is dis-
turbing and completely unac-
ceptable. McDonald's wants to
assure our customers that we
demand humane treatment of
animals by our suppliers," Bob
Langert, McDonald's vice presi-
dent for sustainability, said in a
statement.
The move also followed a
warning letter to Sparboe Farms
dated Wednesday from the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration
that said inspectors found "seri-
ous violations" at five Sparboe
facilities of federal regulations
meant to prevent salmonella.
The warning said eggs from
those facilities "have been pre-
pared, packed, or held under
insanitary conditions whereby
they may have become contami-
nated with filth, or whereby
they may have been rendered
injurious to health."
Sparboe Companies LLC
issued a statement calling the

video "shocking" and saying an
internal investigation identified
four employees "who were com-
plicit in this disturbing activity"
and were fired this month.
"I was deeply saddened to see
the story because this isn't who
Sparboe Farms is," owner and
president Beth Sparboe Schnell
said in a statement posted on a
company website. "Acts depict-
ed in the footage are totally
unacceptable and completely
at odds with our values as egg
farmers. In fact, they are in
direct violation of our animal
care code of conduct, which all
of our employees read, sign and
follow each day."
Sparboe, which is headquar-
tered in Litchfield, also said on
the website that it has made
management changes, taken
corrective actions sought by the
FDA, and begun retraining all
barn workers in proper animal
care procedures.

University chancellor
Katehi blamed for
authorizing
police intervention
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Pro-
testers sitting on the ground sup-
porting the Occupy Wall Street
movement on the campus of the
University of California, Davis
took a face full of pepper spray
at close range from an officer in
riot gear in an incident that was
captured on cellphone video and
spread virally across the Internet
Saturday.
UC Davis Chancellor Linda
Katehi described the video imag-
es as "chilling" and said she was
forming a task force to investigate
even as a faculty group called for
her resignation because of the Fri-
day police action.
However, a law enforcement
official who watched the clip
called the use of force "fairly stan-
dard police procedure."
In the video, an officer dispas-
sionately pepper-sprays a line
of several sitting protesters who
flinch and cover their faces but
remain passive with their arms
interlocked as onlookers shriek

and scream out for the officer to
stop.
"The use of the pepper spray as
shown on the video is chilling to
us all and raises many questions
about how best to handle situa-
tions like this," Chancellor Linda
Katehi said in a message posted on
the school's website Saturday.
The protest was held in support
of the overall Occupy Wall Street
movement and in solidarity with
protesters at the University of Cal-
ifornia, Berkeley who were jabbed
by police with batons on Nov. 9.
The UC Davis video images,
which were circulated on You-
Tube and widely elsewhere
online, prompted immediate out-
rage among faculty and students,
with the Davis Faculty Associa-
tion saying in a letter Saturday
that Katehi should resign.
"The Chancellor's role is to
enable open and free inquiry, not
to suppress it," the faculty associa-
tion said in its letter.
It called Katehi's authorization
of police force a "gross failure of
leadership."
At a news conference later on
Saturday, Katehi said what the
video shows is "sad and really
very inappropriate." The events
surrounding the protest have
been hard on her personally, but

she had no plans to resign, she
said.
"I do not think that I have vio-
lated the policies of the institu-
tion. I have worked personally
very hard to make this campus a
safe campus for all," she said.
Katehi remained in a media
room for more than two hours
after the news conference, even-
tually walking to an SUV past a
silent group of students nearly
three blocks long, many of them
holding up signs calling for her to
step down, the Sacramento Bee
said.
The statewide Council of UC
Faculty Associations issued a
statement Saturday saying "We
are outraged that the administra-
tions of UC campuses are using
police brutality to suppress dis-
sent, free speech and peaceful
assembly."
Charles J. Kelly, a former Balti-
more Police Department lieuten-
ant who wrote the department's
use of force guidelines, said pep-
per spray is a "compliance tool"
that can be used on subjects who
do not resist, and is preferable to
simply lifting protesters.
"When you start picking up
human bodies, you risk hurting
them," Kelly said. "Bodies don't
have handles on them."

Mayor Bing to cut
1,000 jobs amid
budget crisis
Detroit plans to cut 1,000 jobs
by early next year to help deal
with the city's budget crisis and
avoid the possibility of a state-
appointed emergency finan-
cial manager, Mayor Dave Bing
announced Friday.
The mayor's office said that
departments will identify their
number of layoffs starting the
week of Dec. 5 and layoff notices
will be issued starting the week
of Jan. 21. The administration
said the cuts, which represent 9
percent of the city's workforce of
about 11,000 employees, will save
about $14 million this fiscal year.
"Solving our cash crisis
requires a combination of conces-
sions and tough cuts," Bing said.
"Layoffs will be strategic. We will
limit the impact on residents, pro-
tecting core services like police
and fire protection as much as we
can."

New leaders yet to
establish a formal
court system
ZINTAN, Libya (AP) - Libya's
new leaders said yesterday they
will try Moammar Gadhafi's son
at home and not hand him over
to the International Criminal
Court where he's charged with
crimes against humanity. The
government also announced the
capture of the toppled regime's
intelligence minister, who is also
wanted by the court.
In one of several emerging
complications, however, the for-
mer rebel faction that captured
Seif al-Islam Gadhafi a day ear-
lier is refusing to deliver him to
national authorities in Tripoli,
raising concern over whether he
will get a proper trial and dem-
onstrating the interim leaders'
weak hold over their fractured
nation.
In the capital, Information
Minister Mahmoud Shammam
said ex-Intelligence Minister
Abdullah al-Senoussi was cap-
tured alive yesterday by revolu-
tionary fighters from a southern
region called Fazan, not far from
where Gadhafi's son was seized
on Saturday while trying to flee
to neighboring Niger.
Fighters tracking al-Senoussi
for two days caught up with him
at his sister's house in Deerat al-
Shati, about 40 miles (70 kilo-
meters) south of the desert city
of Sebha, said fighter Abdullah
al-Sughayer. There were few
other immediate details on his
capture, and it was not clear
whether his captors would also
resist turning him over to Trip-
oli.
Though they are wanted
by the International Criminal

Court in The Hague, Nether-
lands, Libya will likely seek to
try both men at home.
Speaking earlier in the day,
before al-Senoussi's capture, the
information minister said Seif al-
Islam, the ousted Libyan leader's
one-time heir apparent, must be
tried in Libya even though the
country's new leaders have yet to
establish a court system.
"It is only fair for the Libyan
people that he is tried here....
Seif al-Islam committed crimes
against the Libyan people,"
Shammam told The Associated
Press.
"The ICC is just a secondary
court, and the people of Libya
will not allow Seif al-Islam to be
tried outside," Shammam said.
The ICC indicted the two men
along with Gadhafi in June for
unleashing a campaign of mur-
der and torture to suppress the
uprising against the Gadhafi
regime that broke out in mid-
February.
Al-Senoussi, Gadhafi's broth-
er-in-law, was also one of six
Libyans convicted in absentia
and sentenced to life in prison
in France for the 1989 bomb-
ing of a French passenger over
Niger that killed all 170 people
on board.
ICC spokesman Fadi El Abdal-
lah said yesterday that Libya
would have to convincingly lay
out its arguments in what is
called a "challenge of admissi-
bility" if it wanted to try the two
men at home instead of sending
them to The Hague court.
"The issue is that there is
already a case before the (ICC)
court," he said. "Now Libya has
a legal obligation under interna-
tional law to present a challenge
to say: 'We have this suspect and
he will be dealt with under our
national laws."'

Civilian protesters
call for a reformed
government
CAIRO (AP) - Egyptian
soldiers and police set fire to
protest tents in Cairo's Tahrir
Square and fired tear gas and
rubber bullets in a major assault
yesterday to drive out thousands
demanding that the military rul-
ers quickly transfer power to a
civilian government. At least 11
protesters were killed and hun-
dreds were injured.
It was the second day of clash-
es marking a sharp escalation
of tensions on Egypt's streets
a week before the first elec-
tions since the ouster of long-
time authoritarian leader Hosni

Mubarak in February. The mili-
tary took over the country, prom-
isinga swift transitionto civilian
rule. Butthe pro-democracypro-
testers who led the uprising have
grown increasingly angry with
the ruling generals, and suspect
they are trying to cling to power
even after an elected parliament
is seated and a new president is
voted in.
Street battles continued
throughout the day and long
into the night, spreading to side
streets and sending a wave of
injuries to makeshift clinics on
the streets.
The military-backed Cabinet
said in a statement that elections
set to begin on Nov. 28 would
take place on time and thanked
the police for their "restraint,"
language that is likely to enrage

the protesters even more.
"We're not going anywhere,"
protester Mohammed Rad-
wan said after security forces
tried unsuccessfully to push
the crowds out of Tahrir, the
epicenter of the uprising. "The
mood is good now and people
are chanting again," he added
after many of the demonstra-
tors returned.
The two days of clashes were
some of the worst since the
uprising ended on Feb. 11.
They were also one of only
a few violent confrontations to
involve the police since theupris-
ing. The black-clad police were
a hated symbol of Mubarak's
regime and after the uprising,
they have largely stayed in the
background while the military
took charge of security.


Muslims demand
more respect from
New York Police

Muslims gather
to protest
discrimination
NEW YORK (AP) - Hun-
dreds of Muslims prayed in
a lower Manhattan park and
marched to New York Police
headquarters Friday to protest
a decade of police infiltrating
mosques and spying on Muslim
neighborhoods.
Bundled in winter clothes,
men and women knelt as the
call to prayer echoed off the
cold stone of government build-
ings.
"Being Muslim does not
negate our nationality," Imam
Talib Abdur-Rashid told the
crowd of about 500 gathered
in Foley Square, not far from
City Hall and local courthous-
es. "We are unapologetically
Muslim and uncompromisingly
American."
The demonstration was
smaller and more subdued than
the Occupy Wall Street protests
that led to clashes with police
and made headlines worldwide.
Police wore windbreakers, not
riot gear, and protesters called
for improved relations with
police.
"We want for you to respect
us," Abdur-Rashid said, "and
we will respect you."
It was the first organized
opposition to the NYPD's
intelligence tactics since an
Associated Press investiga-
tion revealed widespread spy-
ing programs that documented
every aspect of Muslim life in
New York. Police infiltrated
mosques and student groups.
Plainclothes officers catalogued
Middle Eastern restaurants and
their clientele. Analysts built
databases on Arab cab drivers
and monitored Muslims who
changed their names.
"Had this been happening to
any other religious group, all of
America would be outraged,"

said Daoud Ibraheem, 73, a
retired graphic artist from
Brooklyn.
Following the prayer ser-
vice, the Muslims - joined by
about 50 Occupy Wall Street
demonstrators - crowded the
sidewalk for the short walk to
the large police headquarters
building known as One Police
Plaza. They stayed only brief-
ly, chanting for Police Com-
missioner Ray Kelly's ouster,
before returning to Foley
Square.
Protesters carried signs that
said "NYPD Watches Us. Who
Watches NYPD?" A dozen or
so uniformed police officers
monitored the demonstration
and followed the march, but
there were no clashes between
protesters and police
At an unrelated news con-
ference Friday, Kelly told
reporters that he "categori-
cally" denied the idea that the
NYPD was spying.
Kelly and his intelligence
chief, David Cohen, have
transformed the NYPD into
one of the nation's most
aggressive domestic intel-
ligence agencies. It operates
far outside the city borders
and its manpower and budget
give it capabilities that even
the federal government does
not have. NYPD analysts were
among the first to study the
thorny question of how people
are radicalized.
Kelly said his officers only
follow leads and do not simply
trawl neighborhoods.
"We do what we believe
necessary to protect this city,
pursuant to the law," Kelly
said. "We have a battery
of very experienced, well-
trained lawyers that advise us
on all of our tactics and opera-
tions."
Outside the department,
however, there is little over-
sight of the Intelligence Divi-
sion and it's roughly $60
million budget.

Voter turnout a problem for University elections
Last week, the student body voted for new representatives
in the Michigan Student Assembly, LSA Student Govern-
ment and several other student governments on campus.
The fall elections took place on Nov. 16 and 17 and suffered from
low voter turnout - an unfortunate trend in the past few years.
The issue indicates that student government elections are not being
taken seriously on either side of the ballot box. Students and candi-
dates need to recognize the significance of elections on campus and
increase their participation.

FROM THE PUBLIC EDITORf
Blogs are different

id you know that The
Michigan Daily has
blogs? Lots of them? All
accessible through the Daily's
homepage?
My guess: Despite the fact that
blogs have permeated the national
journalistic ambiance to the point
of perhaps becoming the most
popular mode of getting informa-
tion, most readers are probably
not familiar with the Daily's blogs.
But they are an integral part of the
purpose and product of this news-
paper. And I am pleased that an
incident a couple of weeks ago con-
cerning a post made on the Fashion
blog, The Fashion Voyeur, allows
me this chance to discuss this over-
looked section of the Daily.
The incident involved a post
made on The Fashion Voyeur that
was taken by some readers to be
unacceptably mean, unprofes-
sional and uncalled-for. I largely
disagree with that assessment,
but we'll get to the specifics of that
post and its aftermath ina minute.
The Daily's blogs began about
six or seven years ago. Initially,
the news, opinion, arts and sports
sections each had a blog, but many
others have been added since. As I
recall, in the early days, our blogs
were not very exciting. Experi-'
mental and somewhat scattered,
they lacked character while Daily
staffers worked out the kinks of
the blog format.
Eventually, at least some of the
blogs took off. The sports blog
(The Game) is probably the most
popular, and the news blog (The
Wire) is perhaps the most essen-
tial. But for me it was always the
arts blog (The Filter) that was the
most interesting. Even aside from
my own background as an arts
writer for this newspaper, I felt
that The Filter, while inconsistent
and sometimes badly off-tone, had
the character and creativity that is
a hallmark of the blog format.
Launched this fall, The Fashion
Voyeur embodies a niche previ-
ously covered by The Filter, and
borrows more than a little of its
cheeky-declarative voice. I had
not read this blog until the appar-

ently flagrant post in question was
brought to my attention. Reading
some of its posts since then, I find
The Fashion Voyeur to be appro-
priately judgmental and preten-
tious. Its tone may most readily be
defined as "douchy," but I expect
that from a decent fashion com-
mentary blog.
And that brings us to the entry
on that blog titled "Spotted:
Poshh-turing," which was posted
on Oct. 23. It features a man and
woman, both dressed a little too
overwhelmingly for me to compre-
hend. The Fashion Voyeur broke
it down for philistines like me,
including this descriptive excerpt:
"It's possible to look like you're try-
ing too hard while trying to look like
you're not trying too hard. See, it's
like this person read a few articles
on how to wear a tie casually and
then replicated GQ's conception of
what a cool guy looks like."
Catty? Yes, but also funny.
Mean? Maybe, but not unaccept-
ably so. I just don't see a problem
with it. Let me explain.
I've written a handful of col-
umns this term stressing the
importance of this newspaper and
the seriousness with which Daily
staffers must approach their task.
But all of that commentary was
intended for sections of the news-
paper whose job it is to produce
excellent, serious news and com-
mentary. However, journalism is a
field that encompasses much more
than just solid news coverage, con-
sidered commentary and in-depth
magazine and feature stories.
There are other niches in this pro-
fession where the purpose varies,
and thus the execution should too.
One such niche is arts commen-
tary. This paper has long recog-
nized that good writing on things
like film, theater, food and fashion
involves tone and style that has no
place in, say, a news story. (Indeed,
the Daily's very bylaws allow the
arts section special latitude in cre-
atively captioning photos.) None
of this is to say that arts writers
can use the license of creativ-
ity to produce shoddy work:,Get-
ting sarcasm, humor and satire

right is a huge challenge and most
attempts fail. But understanding a
difference in purpose and point is
important.
It's a similar situation with
blogs: They are different, and
readers have to understand that.
While there was negative backlash
to the apparently offensive post on
The Fashion Voyeur, I find most
of it missed the point. It makes
no sense to criticize the Daily's
journalistic integrity just because
a post on the paper's fashion blog
may have been a tad impudent.
Many things are perfectly called-
for in a fashion commentary blog
that would be inappropriate in,
say, an editorial.
To those who panned the blog
entry in question because it was
blithely critical, possibly involved
misleadingthe subjects or was just
poorly thought-out: Those are fair,
and perhaps even valid, criticisms.
I wouldn't necessarily trust every-
thing written in the comments
under the blog post, but the Daily
should look into the allegation
that the photo was obtained under
false pretenses because that's
clearly unacceptable.
But beyond that, for those who
used that moment to criticize this
paper for "poor journalism," I
have no sympathy. I vehemently
disagree with the expectation
expressed by some readers that a
fashion blog should stick to posi-
tive commentary. No section of
the Daily should be afraid to be
critical. And when this paper pro-
duces critical commentary that
is flawed, we should all welcome
negative feedback.
Above all, it's important to
remember that journalism is a wide
and diverse field - and it has more
than enough room for sassy fashion
commentary and curt blog posts.

Only 10 percent - or 1,658 students - in
LSA voted in LSA student government elec-
tions. This was a 2-percent decrease from the
election last fall. According to the U.S. Cen-
sus, only36percent of 18 to 24 year olds voted
in the 2000 U.S. presidential election. This
number is in stark contrast to the 72-percent
voter turnout among adults ages 65 to 74.
Obviously, elections for MSA and LSA Stu-
dent Government exist on a much smaller
scale than presidential elections. However,
the statistics show that voter apathy is not
strictly an issue with student government
elections, but rather a larger issue.
There was also little visible campaigning
from candidates. Student government candi-
dates should make a stronger effort to reach
out to students. Through more campaigning,
voter turnout could increase significantly.
The ballot should not be the first place vot-
ers see candidates' names. If students know
-ho they are voting for and what the candi-
d&es' impact will be on campus, they will
have greater incentive to participate. Debates
or open panels, which did not take place this
election, would be a good way for students
to get to know candidates. They would allow
students to analyze and compare candidates'
platforms and put faces to the names on the
ballot.
Many students have a notion that student

government elections do not seriously affect
them, and therefore, are unimportant. But
$7.19 of each student's tuition goes to MSA,
which is small on an individual level but adds
up to over $190,000 - based on statistics
from 2010 - for the group to spend or allocate
to other student organizations. The election
also decides the students who become the
representatives on the Department of Pub-
lic Safety Oversight Committee, which acts
as a check on the campus police and hears
grievances filed against officers. Thus, while
elections may seem trivial, in actuality they
determine important aspects of student life.
Elections are the most direct and simple
exercise of democracy that students engage in
at the University. Beyond students voting, there
needs to be a sufficient number of candidates.
This fall, there was only one candidate on the
ballot for Rackham's 10 vacant seats in MSA.
If voters are going to take elections seriously,
there must be candidates for them to vote for.
Winter elections will be held next semes-
ter, and students should break the trend of low
voter turnout and a lack of involvement. The
next election is especially important because
it will decide the next MSA president, who
becomes the voice of the student body. Stu-
dents should take advantage of participating
in elections to ensure that their goals and con-
cerns are represented on campus.

A 'GoodGuide' for consumers

Throughout the week of Oct. 24, members
of the ONE Campaign at the University partic-
ipated in a voluntary challenge to live on $1.50
per day - the projected amount those living
in extreme poverty in Africa and throughout
much of the developing world rely on to sur-
vive. This experiment was part of a Campus
Challenge to raise awareness of the escalating
famine in the Horn of Africa and the incred-
ible potential of Feed the Future - a lifesav-
ing program under the United States Agency
for International Development that works to
reduce poverty and hunger by training farm-
ers and equipping them with the necessary
skills and supplies to help better feed their
families and entire communities.
The challenge coincided with the present
budget debates in Congress, where less than 1
percent of the budget goes toward proven pro-
grams like Feed the Future, which are at risk
of being cut. We became even more passion-
ate about the devastating effects these cuts
would have after realizing the difficulty of
surviving on $1.50 a day. We would like to note
that before participating in this challenge, we
were aware that it would only serve as a model
and was not a realistic interpretation of what
living in extreme-poverty is like.
The start of the experiment proved to be
the hardest for most. Participants frequently
complained of eating rice and cooking beans
for hours. I personally became sick half way
through the experiment and was forced to
stop. However, in my first two days, I noticed
that I was perpetually tired, experienced
mood swings, found it difficult to pay atten-
tion in my classes and had no energy to take
part in my daily activities. Some ONE mem-
bers had similar responses.
"When you go shopping with only $10.50
for the whole week, you realize quickly that
you have to sacrifice good, quality ingredi-

ents for the cheapest option you can find.
When the last two days came around and
food was running really short, I started get-
ting a panic feeling that I may not be able to
feed myself," said Mary Kate Cartmill, an
LSA senior and student leader of the Uni-
versity's ONE Campus chapter. "By the third
day, I was having trouble staying awake in
class and a three-hour shift at work drained
my energy. I didn't realize how huge of an
impact diet has on concentration and produc-
tivity, which are both essential as a student."
At the end of the experiment, we reflected
on our experiences and had similar respons-
es to the effects of the challenge. We agreed
that it made us more aware of the famine
and food crisis currently taking place and
allowed us to better understand the difficulty
faced by the inconceivable number of people
living on this amount or less every day.
"I can't say that at the end of this chal-
lenge I know what it's like for the 1.4 billion
individuals around the world living on $1.50
a day because I always had the comfort of
knowing that at the end of the week I was
able to revert back to 'life as usual."' Cartmill
said, "but I think the first time seriously ask-
ing yourself 'What am I eating tomorrow?'
really makes the plight of those individuals
sink in a little deeper and brings the entire
issue a little closer to home."
Since this project, ONE members have
made phone calls, written letters and col-
lected petition signatures to help stop cuts for
programs that are saving and improving lives
throughout the developing world - all for less
than 1 percent of the entire U.S. budget. Our
experiences from the $1.50/day challenge are
driving us to engage University students and
inform them of this escalating crisis.

While making any sort of transaction in the Ameri-
can marketplace, everyone must inevitably make deci-
sions between competing companies and products.
There are so many elements to consider. I consider
energy efficiency, whether or not the manufacturing
company supports the American economy and labor
force, whether environmentally sustainable practices
are employed, the content of ingredients - organic and
non-toxic - and more. These make up a portion of the
criteria I use to evaluate competitor products and com-
panies while making a purchase - ensuring that my
purchases reflect my ethical concerns, preferences and
values, including my health and environmental impact.
These are also the elements that make up my personal
filter on GoodGuide.com.
GoodGuide is a relatively new online database - it
was launched in 2008 - that aids consumers in mak-
ing more informed decisions in the marketplace and
provides an easy, comprehensive and novel approach
to product review. University of California-Berkeley
Enviornmental and Labor Policy Prof. Dara O'Rourke,
the co-founder and chief sustainability officer of the
company, has said that his mission is to make it easier
to find products that are safe, healthy, green and social-
ly responsible. GoodGuide is funded by social venture
investors and traditional venture capitalists, and part-
nered with an extensive network of non-government
organizations, academics and large companies.
How does GoodGuide work? Researching prod-
ucts and their origin can be an incredibly lengthy and
time-consuming process. GoodGuide employs a crew,
composed of chemists, nutritionists, environmental
life cycle assessment experts and toxicologists, that
has analyzed more than 120,000 products (household,
personal, food, etc.) and the companies behind the
product. They also use information based on more than
1,000 different sources: the companies themselves,
governmental databases about the policies and practic-
es of big publicly-traded firms, private research firms,
NGOs, policy practices, political partisan endorse-
ment, media sources and academics.
Once analyzed, the product analysis is broken down
into three main sub-scores:
1. Human health impact - how the product affects
the physical body.

2. Environmental impact - how the product is pro-
duced and manufactured as well as the supply chain,
potential consequences, raw material origin, distribu-
tion, sale and disposal of a product.
3. Social responsibility - the impact on society the
product or company has.
The product is then assigned a rating ranging from
zero to 10 - the highest score indicates superb perfor-
mance, and the lowest indicates subpar performance. *
GoodGuide doesn't stop there. You can install a tool-
bar onto your browser free of charge and utilize your
personal filter and GoodGuide ratings on e-commerce
sites in the online marketplace. Thus, when you are
browsing, the bottom portion of your screen will show
how the product matches your personalized filter,
the GoodGuide rating and suggestions for alternative 0
products that can better meet your standards, along
with pricing and consumer ratings. Additionally, the
new, cost-free smartphone app (iPhone and Android)
scans the barcode of a product and sends all the online
information straight to your phone. Your preferences
and filter can be used virtually wherever you go.
GoodGuide empowers consumers by showing exactly
what their capital is supporting, which leads to smarter,
healthier and more environmentally friendly purchases.
Why does this matter? As more and more consumers
start to employ GoodGuide into their daily lifestyles, we
will see a gradual change in the marketplace. Consum-
ers' preferences will become more defined, and large
retail and manufacturing companies will feel the pres-
sure and incentive to supply and meet the standards of
this new market demand by making more environmen-
tally sustainable products and producing them using
ethical sourcing of raw materials and labors, according
to O'Rourke. O'Rourke sees GoodGuide as a more trans-
parent and sustainable marketplace that cuts through S
marketing and advertising - revealing the truth
through the multilayer process and numerous players
that go into the raw material, production, labor, politics,
supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, marketing
and sale of a product. O'Rourke hopes to see GoodGuide
send a signal to companies that business as usual means
business as sustainable.

than $4,0 million to various
organizations' and is"centered
on LGBT leadership programs,
diversity initiatives and devel-
opment of CyberCenters, which
allow members of the LGBT
community to network and com-

Bohnett said the foundation
focuses on the challenges of
health and happiness, earning a
living, military and public service,
personal safety, legalizing gay
marriage and other equal oppor-
tunities for members of the LGBT
community. To make significant
changes, Bohnett said there must
be large-scale modifications in
culture and public opinion, which
can stem from legislation in fed-
eral policy such as the repeal of
'don't ask, don't tell.'
"We have been and we are
becoming a broader, progressive
movement," Bohnett said. "In
my experience ... we take a great
deal of effort to integrate with
the labor movement, the broader
progressive movement."
Bohnett added that he is sup-
portive of the Obama admin-
istration's willingness to enact
non-discrimination policies that
will impact a variety of LGBT
citizens.
"I was just at a meeting in
Washington this week, and
there's averydeliberate, thought-
ful and specific approach to
include sexual orientation with
the federal adherent require-
ment," he said. "That means that
any contract for doing work for
the federal government will have
to have a non-discrimination
policy in place for sexual orienta-

said the recent renovations and
upgrades were "absolutely nec-
essary."
He added that more needs
to be done to better the Uni-
versity's recreational facilities,
including improving natural
lighting, increasing capacity,
replacing outdated equipment
and creating more open spaces.
Michigan Student Assembly
President DeAndree Watson
said encouraging the University
to improve recreational facilities
is a high priority on the assem-
bly's agenda.
"Our facilities are no where
close to the universities we com-
pete with, including Ohio State,"
Watson said.
A group of student leaders
called the Core 20 - led by LSA
sophomore Vivian Wu, chair of
the Student Advisory Board, and
LSA senior Jessica Kraft, presi-
dent of the Club Sports Coun-
cil - is working with a group of
consultants to get information
from students about their needs
tion."
At a luncheon on Friday, Will
Sherry, associate director of the
Spectrum Center, gave a short
speech lauding the importance
of discussions about LGBSissues
amonggenmaratiwcataofanhi: "
"This really is the heart of the
weekend - it's about being able to
collaborate with each other, learn
from each other and develop rela-
tionships between students and
alumni that can be lasting," Sher-
ry said during the event.
In an interview after his
speech, Sherry said getting
involved with the Spectrum Cen-
ter as a graduate student allowed
him to not only help others, but
also grow personally.
"It really allowed me as a grad-
uate student to grow and learn,"
he said. "I had the opportunity to
be a coming-out group facilitator
when I was a graduate student
and help other students in the
process of coming out."
Sherry said he also personally
sought help from the Spectrum
Center, and the experience reaf-
firmed his dedication to his work
since he went through the trans-
gender transition process while
he was a staff member at the
Spectrum Center.
"I know, as a person who sits
in a place of a lot of support in
the community, that it's still a
really hard process, so I can only
imagine for people who need to
find that support and don't have
it readily available, hence the
importance of our office on cam-
pus," Sherry said.
University Dean of Students
Laura Blake Jones, who attended
the luncheon, said in an inter-
view after the event that she is
impressed by the Spectrum Cen-
ter's work and is looking forward
to its future endeavors.

on campus, including what
they'd like to see in recreational
facilities.
The group's initiative also
includes garnering students'
views on improving University
unions. The students plan to
release a survey next month to
develop a funding formula to
address these needs.
"The three recreation build-
ings embody the student experi-
ence here at Michigan - what it
means to be a student in and out
of the classroom," Wu said. "We
are not at a capacity to serve the
students as it is right now."
LSA freshman Ryan Gaiss
said he thinks improvements
to recreational facilities will
encourage more people to go to
the buildings, including to cheer
their friends on during intramu-
ral sports games.
"Having fans on the sidelines
is a huge confidence booster,"
Gaiss said. "It gives someone
who's competitive like me the
urge to do as best as I can."
"We're leading the country in
terms of being the first place that
has a Spectrum Center," Jones
said. "We continued to sort of
be innovative and lead our peers
around the country in terms of
piogram areas thut haveopened'a
up, and I'm just really excited to
see what the next 40 years are
going to be like."
In an interview during the
luncheon on Friday, Univer-
sity alum Thomas McCulloch,
a retired attorney living in Lan-
sing, Mich., said he is surprised
and impressed by the continual
development of new programs
at the University since he gradu-
ated in 1975.
"It's very interesting because
the Spectrum Center didn't exist
when I was an undergraduate,
and this is just another example
where I'm constantly aware and
sort of marvel at how times have
changed," McCulloch said.
McCulloch added that there
was no open community of LGBT
people when he attended the
University.
"The gay men, we knew who
each other were, but the folks
who were out were rare excep-
tions," McCulloch said. "It was
an interesting sort of undercur-
rent going on and we were there,
and we knew who we were."
LSA senior Alyssa Francini
said having an organization like
the Spectrum Center is crucial to
building tolerance and commu-
nity in a collegiate setting.
"I wasn't here 40 years ago
when things like this had to
be created for people to come
together," Francini said. "Now,
we're lucky enough to be stu-
dents at this University where if
there's a will there's a way, and if
there's a want, it will be given to
us."

O1cials: 32 homes gutted
in out-of-season Reno blaze

10,000 residents
evacuate from 2,000-
acre fire on Friday
RENO, Nev. (AP) - Austin
and Sarah Hardage were getting
their first look at the charred
rubble that used to be their home
Saturday afternoon when a U.S.
Postal Service truck pulled up.
"At least we still have a mail-
box," Austin Hardage, 23, joked
as he ran down the driveway to
grab the mail.
He then explained how they
awoke to a smoky, orange glow
through the windows about 2
a.m. Friday before joining nearly
10,000 other southwest Reno
residents in an evacuation.
Their home is among the
32 that were destroyed by the
unusual, out-of-season blaze
that spread by gale force winds
and ripped through the Sierra
foothills.
Gov. Brian Sandoval was
among a number of leaders who
opined on Saturday that it was a
miracle that scores more homes
weren't lost.
"This was not only a wild
land, urban-interface type fire,
it was also a metro fire where
we had homes that were actively
burning in densely populated
areas," Reno Fire Chief Mike
Hernandez said.
Many families "had to leave
in the middle of the night with

very, very limited possessions
and they are coming back to dev-
astation, to nothing," he said.
"So our hearts and prayers go
out to those families."
With flames speeding down
the hillside behind the Hard-
ages' house, they decided to grab
some clothes and the pets and
flee at about 2 a.m.
"Three computers, two dogs
and two rabbits. That's pretty
much all we have now," Austin
Hardage said Saturday, his voice
giving way to some tears.
"I'm sorry," he told a reporter.
"It hadn't really hit me until I
start talking about it."
The house itself in an upscale
gated community near Lak-
eridge Golf Course burned to its
foundation.
"It's all just glass and twisted
metal," he said. -
But in a twist that played
out time and time again across
the 2,000-acre fire, neighbor-
ing houses on either side were
untouched by the flames.
"It's just amazing - Murphy's
Law," Austin Hardage said. "It
didn't even touch either house
on either side. It doesn't make
any sense."
A few miles away, Tim Swee-
ney ended up on the good side of
a similar situation.
"The house directly south of
me burned completely down,"
he said. But Sweeney's house -
with stucco walls and a concrete
tile roof - suffered relatively

minor damage when blowing
embers got underneath the tiles
and started burning in the attic.
"Just about everything
around the perimeter of my
house is gone," Sweeney said.
"Luckily, there was no real
damage to the house except
where they had to cut holes in
the ceiling," he said.
Sweeney, an architect who
has lived there 25 years, said
the flames had gotten within
100 feet of his home atop Windy
Hill when he "finally had to get
out of there." Reno firefighters
showed up about the same time,
he said.
"Those guys just busted
their butts fighting that fire.
They first thought they were
not going to be able to save it,"
Sweeney said.
Sandoval said after a heli-
copter tour of the area Saturday
that while the loss of homes was
tragic, the 400 firefighters on
the lines are heroes for saving
more than 4,000 houses that
could have burned in the blaze
investigators suspect was start-
ed by arcing power lines.
"When you see something like
that, you can't help but be struck
by the awesome and random
power of nature," Sandoval said
about the blackened path of the
fire that snaked along the edge of
the foothills.
"It is nothing short of a
miracle the amount of homes
that have been saved," he said.

ing a negative effect on its admis-
sions for next year.
"Nothing in our basic educa-
tional mission or approach will
change," Dillard wrote. "In fact,
we can see ways that the move
will heighten the appeal of the
RC as an intentional community
since leaving the East Quad has
forced us to think more actively
and creatively about what our
community is and how best to
keep it strong and engaged."
The $116 million East Quad
renovation is expected to be
finished in summer 2013. The
improvements will be "top-to-
bottom," Dillard wrote.
"It's ... one that preserves the
traditional feel of the old East
Quad while making much need-
ed improvements in terms of
both structure and design," she
wrote.
East Quad renovations will
include new fire detection and
suppression systems, plumbing,
heating and ventilation systems,
upgraded restrooms and student
rooms, an improved dining hall,
better Internet access and acces-
sibility modifications, according
to Logan.
The goals for the East Quad
renovation are consistent with
the Residential-Life Initiatives
launched by University Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman in 2004,
Logan wrote in an e-mail inter-
view.
"With the renovation, Univer-
sity Housing will be able to pro-
vide an environment that truly
serves the living-learning con-
nection so visible and dynamic
for the past many years," Logan
wrote.
The renovations will add new
sustainability features in East
Quad, according to Logan. Some
water conservation improve-
ments include dual-flush toilets,
as well as flow-reduction sink
faucets and showerheads. Stu-
dent rooms will be equipped
with dual temperature systems
with individual thermostat con-
trol, and zone heating and cool-
ing will manage energy use in
different parts of the building.
Dillard wrote that though
leaving East Quad may be dif-

win this game," Kovacs said.
Michigan won 45-17. You do
the math.
The Wolverines dominated
the Cornhuskers in every facet
of the game. When they sensed
Nebraska was down, they
pushed them farther down until
there was nowhere left to go.
Michigan out-rushed the
Cornuskers - a team known for
its prowess in the running game
- by 100 yards. Redshirt sopho-
more running back Fitzgerald
Toussaint out-gained Nebraska
on his own with 138 yards on 29
carries.
The defense held star
Nebraska running back Rex
Burkheard, who averages more
than 107 yards per game, to just
36 yards. Quarterback Taylor
Martinez was running for his
life more often than he was
gaining positive yards. No doubt
he'll have nightmares of facing
Michigan's senior defensive
linemen Mike Martin and Ryan
Van Bergen.
And special teams? Well, all
they did was force two huge
turnovers that changed the fate
of the game.
The Wolverines have taken
their lumps this year. A loss
at Iowa two weeks ago was an
opportunity they'd love to have
back, and they'd surely love

another crack at the Spartans.
But when this teams falls
down, it sure doesn't take long
to get right back up.
After the Michigan State loss,
Michigan came back home and
pounded Purdue. After the Iowa
loss, the Wolverines beat up
on out of Illinois, a team once
thought to be one of the Big
Ten's best.
And yet, even after a com-
manding win in Champaign
last Saturday, the doubts still
lingered. Michigan had yet to
beat a top-25 team. Nebraska
needed a win to stay in the hunt
for the Big Ten title. This was
the perfect opportunity for the
Wolverines to blow it.
They didn't.
And now, Michigan is one
win away from a 10-2 season. Be
honest, before the season, you
said you'd be happy with 8-4.
Not only is 10-2 a possibility,
it's expected.
"I think that is the best win
we've had since I'vebeen on
the team, just because it's so
late in the year," Kovacs said. "I
don't think that we've ever had
a game this late in November
that really meant as much as
this one."
This one meant a lot - now,
the next one will mean even
more.
Ohio awaits.

East Quad Residence Hall, which currently houses the Residential College, will close for renovations at the end of the
winter 2012 semester. The RC will wove to West Quad Residence Hall during the renovation period.

ficult for students who like the
familiarity and closeness of the
building, the move will help
facilitate student bonding.
"Taking the RC out of that
comfort zone and making it
more dispersed in terms of space
means that we all have to be
much more thoughtful, reflective
and intentional," Dillard wrote.
"Working hard at something like
community building can make it
all the more meaningful."
LSA freshman Christiana
Allen-Pipkin, who is in the Resi-
dential College, said she is look-
ing forward to living in West
Quad, but will miss the advan-
tages of East Quad.
"While I'm excited about the
changes - because East Quad
really needs to be renovated -
it's also going to be different not
having class here," Allen said. "I
am so used to just coming down-
stairs to go to Spanish."
Allen said she is also excited
about the installation of new,
higher showerheads - an issue

Dillard noted was a huge con-
cern for students as they indi-
cated in last year's housing
survey. Allen added that she is
looking forward to the changes
in the dining hall layout, which
will make eating with students
from the RC easier.
"The dining hall setup right
now is kind of a problem," Allen
said. "It's nice to have a whole
area for lunch tables (for the
RC), but they are so far from the
cafeteria that you have to bring
extra food because you can't go
back."
While the RC moves to West
Quad, the Health Sciences Schol-
ars Program living and learn-
ing community will relocate to
Couzens.
Couzens was the home of the
University's School of Nursing
from 1925 until 1954, accord-
ing to Tomas Baiza, associate
director of the HSSP. The Cen-
tral Residence for Nurses origi-
nally housed approximately
260 nursing students before it

was re-named after its benefac-
tor, former U.S. Senator James
Couzens.
"University Housing and LSA
both felt that HSSP's relocation
to Couzens would be a unique,
opportunity to tap into the build-
ing's health-care past and serve
as a hub for students generally
interested in health and well-
ness," Baiza wrote in an e-mail
interview.
Couzens reopened this year
following a comprehensive
renovation upgrading its infra-
structure and additions out-
lined in the Residential Life
Initiatives program. Since
Couzens offers state-of-the-art
learning and meeting spaces,
HSSP will be able to hold more
of its events and classes there,
Baiza wrote.
"Living in a new building
where there is a lot of positive
energy will inspire our students
to do new and innovative things
that enhance everyone's experi-
ence," Baiza wrote.

1,001 webcomics

Pointed 'Hedgehog'

it's 12:01 a.m. on a Monday
morning, and once again I
find myself hunched over
my laptop furiously refresh-
ing my web
browser.
My favorite
webcomic,
"Minor Acts
of Heroism,"
is due to
update at any
minute, and LAUREN
last week's CASERTA
cliffhanger
has left me in
six straight days of excruciating
suspense.
As I wait anxiously for the
next single-page installment to
appear, I silently hope the rig-
ors of my author's day job won't
interfere with what looks to be
a strong, original storyline that
could easily unfold within a year
or two. Though some webcom-
ics shun continuity in favor of
weekly spontaneity, many artist
take a more linear approach to
their work, choosing to write
and illustrate their own multi-
volume fictional tales, which are
drawn and released page-by-
page on a daily or weekly basis.
These definitely aren't your
dad's Marvel Comics mass-
productions: Webcomics rarely
generate much revenue, and
their creators are usually free-
lance designers and market-
ing artists who have lovingly
poured time and effort into
these beloved pet projects as
personal creative outlets. The
results are often stunning and
always entertaining - if you
haven't laughed and cried after
reading Der-Shing Helmer's
"The Meek," then you're either
a rock or Keanu Reeves.
As an avid reader and listener
I rejoice in the idea that the art
of the illustrated story could
translate well into digital form.

French flick
explores spiky
relationships
By MATT EASTON
Daily Arts Writer
Paloma is a troubled 11-year-old
girl. Intelligent, bored and ulti-
mately lonely, she decides to kill
herself on her
12th birthday. *
First though,
she feels she The
must film the
world around Hedgehog
her to prove its At the
banality to oth- Michigan
ers. So Paloma
(Garance Le NeoClassics
Guillermic,
"London mon amour") hides in
corners and points her lens at her
unimportant and uninteresting
family. Below her lives the jani-
tor, Renee (Josiane Balasko, "Cli-
ente"), who is satisfied to settle
within the mold of the cranky,
overlooked worker so she may
live a private existence. These two
lives combine to create a film that
is simple but deeply satisfying.
"Hedgehog" focuses on the
small, slow movements of every-
day life. Paloma must remove her
glasses to put her eye against her
camera, acknowledging the irony
that she must remove what allows
her to see, to see. The glasses
become tangled in her blonde
mess of hair and she struggles in
real time pulling them out. In one
scene, she and Renee thought-
fully let dark chocolate sit on
their tongues, melting slowly. The
audience is left watching these
moments organically unfold, and
while it's occasionally boring, it's
also oddly relatable.
Paloma's camera creates a
strange world for her to inhabit.

"And then - BAM! You kick it up another notch."

She fears being caught in "a fish
bowl," so she pushes a wedge
between herself and others
with the lens. It's funny though
because in this separation she
becomes likea goldfish in a pitch-
er of water, watching the world
through a layer of glass. In one
scene she films her sister while
looking through a glass of water -
it's an example of how the camera
becomes a method of self-destruc-
tion in the hands of Paloma. The
true moments of intimacy are the
moments when she decides to set
down the camera and touch the
world around her.
Outside of Paloma, there exists
the true strength of the film, the
relationship between Renee and
the Japanese occupant in her
apartment complex, Kakuro Ozu
(Togo Igawa, "A Matter of Size").
Ozu is the sort of man who under-
stands the importance of looking
people in the eyes when you thank
them, and his kindness is the force
that allows the moving combina-
tions in "Hedgehog" to form.
Quiet, refined and educated,
Ozu gives this French film a
distinctly Japanese spirit. He
believes objects can be more than
one thing. Renee may be a lot like
a hedgehog, prickly on the outside
but soft underneath - but this
doesn't mean she must sacrifice
her elegance seeking a life of pri-

vate enlightenment. One can be
both an introvert and an extro-
vert. It is this message that the
audience desperately hopes Palo-
ma will receive before she ends
her life. People can choose when
to hide in a ball of spines and
when to explore - they aren't des-
tined to be trapped in a fishbowl.
In a way, "Hedgehog" is a sort
of twist on "Catcher in the Rye."
At times Paloma can be unbear-
ably dramatic. She is young
and obviously overreacts to the
pointlessness of life around her.
Thankfully, her story is gracefully
complemented by the fulfilling
romance of Renee and Ozu. He is
reaching out for Rende asking for
love, but she is hesitant to grasp
it. They are like teenagers caught
in their first romance, uncomfort-
able holding hands and unsure of
how to proceed.
"Hedgehog" is like Ozu in his
relationship with Renee. It wants
us to take hold of the world, to
not be afraid to leave ourselves.
It's a film for anyone who has
ever been too shy to ask for a first
date; for anyone who has sat at a
party trapped in his or her own
thoughts, surrounded by the
noise of pointless conversations,
desperately wanting (even if they
don't know it) to make some sort
of connection with others - to
touch something.

They were authentic but not abra-

The Wu-Tang Clan changed

is still unparalleled - stretching
from Raekwon's mafioso style to
ODB's absurdity, and everything
in between. In the time it took for
36 Chambers to play, my 11-year
old infatuation with rap returned
and brought with it an embarrass-

little more interested in the word-

time around, but I will always be

plummets into shadowy depths
with vampiric speeds.
The apparently "animalistic"

the best films in the "Twilight"

chances to showcase their newly

disappointing movie.
Maybe Condon realized this

counterpart, it wasn't enough
to save "Breaking Dawn" from
breaking down.

TV NOTEBOOK
. Tv6ie -Qrop of strong female ch

ByKAYLA UPADHYAYA
DailyArts Writer
A witch, a vampire, a queen,
a federal agent and a scheming
socialite - at first glance, these
characters don't seem to have
much in common. But together
they make up an A-team of tele-
vision's best new female charac-
ters. All six are dynamic, strong
female characters for varying
reasons. Forevery Liz Lemon and
Leslie Knope, there are at least a
dozen one-dimensional and sex-
ist representations of women on
television (look no further than
most of FOX's new program-
ming), which makes these six
outstanding female characters all
the more valuable.
Let's start with Carrie Mathi-
son (Claire Danes) of Showtime's
new fast-paced political drama
"Homeland." Early in the show,
we find out Carrie suffers from
a personality disorder. Though
we have yet to see the form her
condition takes when she's not
on medication, Carrie is a fireball
who always seems on the brink of
exploding. Though high up in the
CIA ranks, she's marginalized
by her coworkers for her radical
theories. Sometimes the sexism
is subtle and sometimes it's a
bit more obvious, like when one
male coworker jokes that Carrie

might owe him sex after he helps
with one of her cases. But Carrie
remains strong and determined
in her work and life, even taking
on a gang of neo-Nazis in a bar.
Granted, she was drunk, but it
was still awesome.
Teen witch Faye Chamberlain
(Phoebe Tonkin) of "The Secret
Circle" is unstable and unpredict-
able like Carrie. She is brutally
honest and more perceptive than
the other characters, able to see
what is happening before anyone
else. Faye could have easily been
written as the beautiful, bitchy
popular girl, but instead she is
lonely. She's a bad girl with self-
esteem problems who tends to
say rude things to her friends but
always has their best interests in
mind. She is also the most realistic
of the witches on the show in that
she just wants to have fun with
her powers. Hey, if I found out I
was a witch, I'd be casting spells
left and right, too.
This television season has also
been great for new female vil-
lains, like Rebekah (Claire Holt) of
"The Vampire Diaries." Rebekah
is super-villain Klaus's (Joseph
Morgan) sister, which makes her
one of the Original Vampires. She
is vicious and powerful, having
little regard for human life. But in
usual "Vampire Diaries" fashion,
Rebekah isn't wholly evil: Family


is the most important motivator the hi
for her, and she loves passion- is all-
ately. And though Rebekah thinks What

the opening," Eisendrath said. "I
wanted to go with what sounded
the best and the most theatrical
- I didn't even realize that we
had gone to the same school."
In fact, Esendrath had just
missed the creative duo at the
University. In the summer of
2003, Eisendrath had just grad-
uated, and Pasek and Paul came
to Ann Arbor for the first time
as incoming freshmen, becom-
ing friends after meeting at ori-
entation.
But regardless of timing, the
three 'U' alums had little diffi-
Federall culty working with one another
NCUA Insed Y on the show's newest version.
NU "Because we've all received

training from (the University),
we're all very much on the same
page and have similar points of
view and similar vocabularies to
work with," Eisendrath said.
After Pasek and Paul were
hired in March 2010, they had
three months to compose a score
and write new lyrics before pre-
senting their progress in June.
"Our situation was really
advantageous and daunting at
the same time," Pasek said. "The
show had already been done
successfully in Kansas City, so
the structure and script were
already there andehe moments
'were akeadly ripe for sngs."
Pasek and Paul began their
work by "song spotting," look-
ing for places in the script where
they thought there should be a
song but previously wasn't.
According to Pasek, an addi-
tional song created by the duo
entitled "Ralphie to the Rescue,"
stemmed from a 45-second clip
from the movie. In the film, Ral-
phie daydreams about saving his
family with his Red Ryder BB
gun when robbers break into his
home.
"In the musical, this became a
big number where Ralphie gets
to live out his fantasy and be a
cowboy," Pasek said. "There's
a saloon shootout scene in the
song, he rescues his teacher and
family, and there's a bank rob-
bery scene all in one song."
The team struggled to uphold
the story's integrity, fall within
a reasonable run time and all
the while avoid the cheesy glitz
sometimes found in musical
productions.
Because of their friendship,
the music and lyrics team were
able play off each other while
staying true to the story.
"If I don't like what he writes
or he doesn't like what I write,
we don't have to tiptoe around
each other," Pasek said. "At the
end of the day we're friends and
collaborators, so even if he hates
my ideas he doesn't hate me."
The duo has come a long
way since their orientation at
the University. As sophomores
in 2005, they wrote the musi-
cal "Edges." The production,
which was performed the Ker-
rytown Concert House, marked
the beginning of their careers as
composers and lyricists.
When Pasek and Paul's pro-
duction of "A Christmas Story"
premiered last year in Seattle,
Paul remembered the over-
whelming pre-show feeling,
tinged with excitement.
"I remember being in the the-
ater before the show opened,"
Paul said. "I was sitting in
the balcony looking down at a
2,300-seat house and realizing
our show would be onstage."
Though "A Christmas Story"
has been immensely well
received wherever it's gone,
Eisendrath, Paul and Pasek
are especially excited to bring
the show home to Michigan,
the state where their musical
careers began.

The Michigan football team celebrates moments after beating Nebraska at home. It was serenaded with cheers of "Beat Ohio," as the Wolverines enter The Game with a better record than Ohio State for the first time since 2004.
Michigan shucks Huskers in Big House rout

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
The only thing weaker than
the Nebraska offense on Satur-
day was Michigan Stadium.
A power outage left the Big
House blacked out for most of
the afternoon. Once the game got
underway, the No. 20 Michigan
football team's defense knocked
the lights out of the 17th-ranked
Cornhuskers in the Wolverines'
45-17 victory.
"This is a big win - huge - I
can't stress that enough," said
redshirt junior safety Jordan
Kovacs. "I think that this is the
best win that we've had since I've
been on the team, just because
it's so late in the year.
"I don't think that we've ever
had a game this late in November
that really meant as much as this
one."
Nebraska running back Rex
Burkhead entered the contest
ranked third in the Big Ten, aver-

aging 107 rushing yards through
the first 10 games of the season.
In the first half against Michi-
gan, he was held to four yards.
Four yards.
Burkhead finished with 36
yards, well short of his previous
season low of 55.
"I thought we were awful on
offense," said Nebraska coach
Bo Pelini. "We didn't execute.
We took ourselves out of drives.
It was not a good day for us on
offense."
It was another notch in Michi-
gan coach Brady Hoke's belt,
and another step closer to the
full resurgence of a Michigan
defense. Yet the defense's per-
formances are getting more con-
vincing.
After holding a weak Illinois
offense to 14 points last Saturday,
the Wolverines stifled Nebraska
(4-3, 8-3) - a team ranked sec-
ond in the Big Ten, scoring an
average of 32.9 points per game.
"Coming into the game, we

knew it was gonna be a big game,
both (teams) coming in 8-2," said
senior defensive tackle Mike
Martin. "We want to make a
statement every time we take the
field."
The game began with some
flash and some flair. The flash
was four F-16 jets performing
a flyover over the stadium. The
flair was the 65,000-person card
stunt combining to form a mas-
sive American flag during the
flyover.
After kickoff, it went more
flash and bang.
That flash was junior quar-
terback Denard Robinson, who
found his stride against the
Cornhuskers, rushing for 83
yards.
Robinson also burned Nebras-
ka through the air, going 11-of-18
in the passing game for 180 yards
and two touchdowns.
Redshirt sophomore running
back Fitzgerald Toussaint was
deadly on the ground, running

for 138 yards and a pair of scores
on 29 carries.
That bang was Michigan's
defense and special teams unit.
The Wolverines forced and
recovered two fumbles on sec-
ond-half kickoffs and blocked a
"munt. yfji ian a so p'l ea 'ft
a fake field goal that went for a
red-zone first down.
On defense, the Wolverines
forced and recovered another
fumble.
It was a long day for Nebraska
quarterback Taylor Martinez,
who was hounded by Michigan's
veteran defensive line to the tune
of three sacks.
Martinez forced passes
and came up empty. His final

Buckeyes bury 'M' in first
sweep at Yost since 1986

Michigan coach Brady Hoke has the Wolverines ranked No.15 in the latest BCS standings after a 9-2 start.
Signature win puts Blue
back in spotligh

When the Nebraska
football team last
visited Michigan Sta-
dium, the year was 1962 and the
Cornhuskers were Big 8 bottom
feeders. They
had had just
three winning
seasons in
the previous
two decades,
posting an
overall record {
of 72-125.
Under STEPHEN J.
then-first- NESBITT
year head
coach Bob
Devaney, Nebraska planned to
resurrect its embarrassment of a
football program. In the season
opener against South Dakota, the
Huskers rolled, 53-0.
Even so, the Sept. 29 matchup
with Michigan wasn't expected
to be pretty. Nebraska fans liked
the week-one shutout, but top-
pling a football giant wasn't in
the itinerary - even when facing
a relatively weak Michigan team,
the resurgence could wait.
It didn't. Devaney and the
Cornhuskerstrumped the Wol-
verines, 25-13, at the Big House,
en route to an 8-3 season. That
game, a signature Devaney vic-
tory, set the program on the fast
track to national prominence. His
11-year resume featured a 47-8
record at the helm in Lincoln.
The Cornhuskers' return to
Michigan Stadium last Saturday
was a welcomed trip down mem-
ory lane for Nebraska, in its first
season in the Big Ten.

But the tides were turned for
this go-round at the Big House:
Michigan played the part of
the rebuilding program with a
first-year coach, while Nebraska
has grown into a national pow-
erhouse. On paper, it was a titan
clash between the two win-
ningest programs in college foot-
ball history. In reality, the scales
were tipped in the visitors' favor.
It didn't take long for Michi-
gan coach Brady Hoke to prove
Michigan's turnaround. A 45-17
victory against No. 17 Nebraska
doesn't need much of an explana-
tion - the Wolverines proved
dominant.
After 50 minutes of play, a
"Beat Ohio" chant circled the sta-
dium. The fans had seen enough.
They lauded Hoke by looking
ahead to the season finale against
Ohio State, a matchup he has
anticipated since his arrival in
January.
But don't jump ahead too
quickly. Try to put this victory
in perspective before looking to
next week. It was arguably the
program's biggestcwinsince the
Lloyd Carr era - fitting, since
Carr was honored before the
game.
The resounding victory was a
statement and a signature Hoke
win.
Hoke preaches three simple
things to his team: Win the turn-
over battle, plug the gaps to stop
their running game and establish
your ground game early and
often. Check, check and check.
Special teams players
swarmed to the ball, forcing two

turnovers on kickoffs and block-
ing a punt. Michigan leads the
nation in fumble recoveries with
19 recoveries in 11 games - under
former coach Rich Rodriguez,
the Wolverines had 23 recoveries
in three full seasons. Michigan
held Nebraska running back Rex
Burkhead, the Big Ten's third-
leading rusher, to a season-low
36 yards.
The Wolverines' ground game
dominated from start to finish.
The backfield duo ofjunior quar-
terback Denard Robinson and
redshirt sophomore running back
Fitzgerald Toussaint combined
for 221 yards. Unlike last season,
it hasn't been all Robinson.
Hoke's fingerprints are all over
this team. And it looks like the
prints are going to stay there for a
long time to come.
Rolling into the lastweek of
the season with a 9-2 record,
Hoke has his team in a perfect
position: a victory over the Buck-
eyes could possibly earn Michi-
gan an at-large invitation to a
BCS bowl - think about it.
After years of mediocrity and
embarrassment, Brady Hoke has
the Wolverines back on top. Ann
Arbor is, no doubt, relevant again.
No one wants to visit Michigan
Stadium, where Hoke and Co. are
7-0, outscoring teams 267-65.
Just like Bob Devaney in 1962,
Hoke proved his worth with
Michigan and Nebraska at the Big
House.

Michigan coach Red Berenson
almost always opens his post-
game press conference with some
opening
remarks, OHIO STATE 2
but then MICHIGAN 1
again, the
Michi- OHIO STATE 6
gan hock- MICHIGAN 5
ey team
almost never gets swept at Yost
Ice Arena.
So after a weekend in which
No. 7 Michigan couldn't make
a closing statement, Berenson
didn't make an opening state-
ment.
No. 14 Ohio State buried the
Wolverines for its first sweep at
Yost Ice Arena since 1986. The
sweep relegated Michigan to sev-
enth place in the CCHA and put
the Buckeyes in sole possession
of first.
"They're a good team, give
them credit," Berenson said. "Of
course, our players are embar-
rassed. These are tough losses."
Fifth-year senior goalie
Shawn Hunwick endured his
roughest series of the year. On
Friday, Ohio State won, 2-1, on a
shot from behind the cage that
banked off of Hunwick's blocker
and into the net.
The Buckeyes bombarded
Hunwick with shots on Satur-
day. They dissected the Wolver-
ines' defense and fired 37 shots
on the cage, many of them from
point-blank range or with little
defensive resistance.
"We've got a lot of work to
do," said Michigan coach Red
Berenson after Saturday's game.
"I can't say we got exposed, but
we definitely broke down in
places tonight, and we gave up
goals too easily."
The last time Michigan
scored five goals and lost was
in the Western Regional of the
NCAA Tournament in 2007
against North Dakota..
"You have no chance of win-
ning when you give up six,"
Berenson said. "I can tell you
(in practice) Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday next week will be
defensive-zone coverage."
Perhaps Friday's win-
ning goal - which Berenson
described as "fluky" - still lin-
gered in Hunwick's mind the
following night. Early on, he
failed to cleanly cover up a puck,
though he had ample time, and
it almost led to a goal.

After Ohio State's first goal
on Saturday, Hunwick slung the
puck down the ice in frustra-
tion.
Hunwick broke his stick
against the post after the fifth
goal, which put the Buckeyes up
by two goals entering the third
period.
He could only look down at
his skates and let his arms sag
limply by his sides after the
sixth and final goal.
"When you leave a guy wide
open in front of the net, your
goalie can't make that save very
often," Berenson said. "The
winning goal (on Friday) was a
bad goal, butI didn't see any bad
goals out there (on Saturday). I
thought the puck was going in
because of good plays on their
part, turnovers on our part and
deflections."
When Hunwick shattered his
stick, he spoke for the whole
team.
"Shawn's an emotional kid,"
said senior forward Luke Glen-
dening. "That's the way he plays,
he plays with an edge. And that
gets usrfired up. Obviously he's
frustrated, we're all frustrated
- that's fine."
Every time the Wolverines
grabbed the momentum on
Saturday, the Buckeyes stole it
back. Freshman forward Mike
Chiasson scored the first goal of
the game, but Ohio State (7-2-1
CCHA, 10-3-1 overall) coun-
tered just three minutes later.
After sophomore forward
Luke Moffatt tied it in the sec-
ond stanza, junior forward
Chris Brown picked up a five-

minute major penalty for board-
ing. Michigan killed off the first
four minutes of the penalty, and
the Yost crowd appeared ready
to erupt. Then a turnover led to
a goal, followed by another sec-
onds later.
The Wolverines showed life
late, down two goals, when
sophomore forward Derek DeB-
lois converted on a shorthanded
opportunity. Michigan gave it
right back minutes later.
"I really can't explain it,"
said a frustrated senior forward
David Wohlberg. "It's just - it
seems like things are going that
way right now, and we need to
turn it around. We need to get
the bounces going our way."
The top two forward lines
didn't score a single goal over
the weekend. Freshman for-
ward Alex Guptill led the third
and fourth lines with two goals
on Saturday.
On Friday, only sophomore
defenseman Mac Bennett
scored. Michigan led early in
that one too, but couldn't capi-
talize on a five-minute power
play of its own.
Michigan is winless in its last
four games, its longest winless
streak in two years.
By the middle of the third
period inthe finale as Ohio State
led by two goals, the band's
newest instruments - a pair of
bagpipes - sounded funeral.
"We're really frustrated,"
Glendening said. "We got one
point out of the last 12. No one
likes to lose, and it's not expect-
ed of Michigan. We're expected
to win."

MEN'S to fpu
Wolverines to face elite competition at Maui Invitational

By NEAL ROTHSCHILD
Daily SportsEditor
Monday morning usually isn't
the highlight of anyone's week.
But the No. 17 Michigan bas-
ketball team gets to spend it in
Hawaii,taking on No.10 Memphis
in the first round of the Maui Invi-
tational.
The last time the Wolverines
played the Tigers, the setting was
similar. In 1996, the teams played
in the Rainbow Classic in Hono-
lulu, Hawaii. But this time, they'll
be 150 miles to the northwest, and
Michigan won't be on probation.

The game will be the first of
the eight-team Maui Invitational,
which features
some of the big- Memphis vs.

ketball. If Michigan wins Monday,

it will play the winner of Duke and
Tennessee on Tuesday at 7 p.m.
EST. The championship game will
be on Wednesday at 10 p.m.
"I think this is one of the best
basketball tournaments there
is anywhere, at any level," said
senior guard Zack Novak. "It's
fun to be here. You look at the
programs that will be here - 21
national championships between
all of us - so that's special. It's a
good opportunity and I'm just
looking forward to getting in and
playing in it."
Led by Glen Rice, the Wolver-
ines won the tournament in 1988

and they last played in it in 1998.
"It's an early measuring stick
in the season that you're going to
really see where you are against
teams that are going to be in the
NCAA Tournament," said Michi-
gan coach John Beilein on Sunday.
"So we'll find out very soon where
we are in regards to that and what
we have to work on going for-
ward."
Michigan (3-0) has techni-
cally already played its first Maui
Invitational game. It beat Towson
64-47 last Monday as part of the
"Maui on the Mainland" portion
of the tournament. These games

consisted of the big-name teams
hosting smaller schools on the
continental United States. The
games in Hawaii are known as the
Championship Round.
The win over Towson marked
the middle of the Wolverines'
pre-Hawaii schedule. Michigan
routed Ferris State 59-33 in its
first game of the season and nar-
rowly escaped an upset threat
from Western Illinois, 59-55, on
Thursday.
"You've been with (the team)
for five weeks," Beilein said. "But
you're discovering how they're
going to react on a national stage."
Memphis (1-0) will present
the Wolverines with their big-
gest challenge of the season. The
Tigers are a fast, athletic offen-
sive juggernaut that scored 97
points in its season-opening win
over Belmont. Memphis shot 59
percent in the game, which ranks
first in Division-I.
The Tigers' roster features
three sophomores who were
highly touted recruits a year ago.
Guard Will Barton led the team
in scoring last year and poured
in 23 points in his first game. The
others - Joe Jackson and Tarik
Black - were the second and
third-leading scorers from last
season.
"I see a really long, athletic
team that is going to try to speed
us up," Beilein said. "They're
going to try to have us play at a
pace that we're out of control. We
don't mind being sped up as long
as we're in control of the tempo.
What we can't do is, they speed
us up and then we get wild."
In its first three games, Michi-

gan has shown flashes of bril-
liance, but inconsistency has
plagued the team. Hot-and-cold
shooting, poor post play and a
sometimes stagnant offense have
kept the games closer than they
should have been. The week will
also provide a test for freshman
point guard Trey Burke, who will
be facing the first high-class com-
petition of his career. He has been
effective so far, showing the abili-
ty to create in transition and shoot
the 3-pointer reliably. But facing
the longer, faster teams will pres-
ent a look he hasn't seen yet.
"This will be such a great expe-
rience for Trey to just continue
to mature as one of the young-
est point guards in the country,"
Beilein said of his starting point
guard who has scored 10 points
per game and is shooting 43 per-
cent on 3-pointers.
As a team on the rise that is
looking to enter the elite of college
basketball, Michigan will use this
week to see how it stacks up to the
best national competition. Still,
the tournament means very little
in terms of the Wolverines' bigger
goals for the season.
"I don't think we will take
the results of these tournaments
too much either way because it's
November," Beilein said. "It's
so different than football where
games like this early in the season
will determine where you are in
the BCS.
"For us, it's good and it can
be very positive but if we played
incredibly the whole weekend,
it wouldn't mean anything as far
as our chances in February and
March if we don't improve."

By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily SportsEditor
For some fleeting moments,
Denard Robinson looked like
the same inconsistent quarter-
back who has been at the helm
of the Michigan football team's
offense all season. For all the
other moments,
he just looked NOTEBOOK
fleeting.
In Michigan's 45-17 win over
Nebraska, Robinson passed and
ran for a combined 263 yards and
four touchdowns and threw just
one interception.
The typical "Denard, No!"
moments were there. His screen
pass in coverage that was batted
into the air and intercepted led to
a Cornhusker field goal that knot-
ted the game at 10 points. But for
every one of one of those, there
were two plays similar to his
14-yard touchdown run: finding
the hole, cutting back and outrun-
ning defenders into the endzone.
Robinson's 83 rushing yards
were his highest total since he
eclipsed the century mark-against
Northwestern. The biggest differ-
ence, though, came in the passing
game. He completed 61 percent of
his passes, his highest completion
percentage in three weeks.
One of Robinson's touchdown
passes was a bullet into redshirt
sophomore Jeremy Gallon's hands
with a defender on Gallon's back.
The deep balls that were over-
thrown against Iowa and Illinois
connected on Saturday. Robinson
had four completions of over 20
yards, including the touchdown
pass that put the game away.

Already up 31-17, Michigan had
a third-and-six on Nebraska's
38-yard line early in the fourth
quarter. Robinson lofted a throw
to senior wide receiver Marta-
vious Odoms, who had beaten his
cornerback and snuck behind the
safety. The throw led Odoms into
the back of the endzone, away
from defenders, but it gave him
enough room to get his feet in
bounds for the touchdown.
"That was as good a throw as
I've seen him make, especially
on a long ball," said Michigan
coach Brady Hoke. "It was a great
catch by Martavious, but that was
where he had to put the ball."
RACE OF THE CENTURY:
Odoms probably wouldn't call
it a comeback, but the receiver's
resurgence in recent weeks cer-
tainly looks like it.
As a freshman, Odoms led
the team in receiving. Battling
injuries, his numbers steadily
declined in his sophomore and
junior years. After breaking his
left arm in fall camp this season
and practicing with a cast, Odoms
didn't make a catch in Michigan's
first eight games.
But in the past two weeks,
Odoms has increased his role,
catching four passes for two
touchdowns, including Saturday's
catch. Finally healthy, Odoms is
back to full speed.
"Me and Martavious had a race
(two years ago)," Robinson said.
"So, I've seen that he can run. And
he ran right past the defenders
and I put it in the air."
As for who won the race?
"You go ahead and tell them,"
Robinson told Odojms at the post-

Junior quarterback Denard Robinson tied Tom Brady for seventh on Michigan's all-time career passing touchdownsNlist.

game press conference.
"I ain't going to tell them,"
Odoms responded. "You tell 'em."
"He beat me," Robinson said.
"He got the win there."
CLOCK CRAZIES: Early in the
game with Michigan inside the
Cornhuskers' 10-yard line, Rob-
inson was called for a delay-of-
game penalty. It wasn't that he
lost track of the 25-second clock,
it was that he didn't have one.
Shortly before the game,
Michigan Stadium's power went
out. Auxiliary generators pow-
ered the north scoreboard, but

there wasn't enough electricity
to power the south, which was
the end of the field the Michigan
offense was facing.
The back referee started a
countdown with 10 seconds
remaining when the play went
off, but Robinson was confused
on which official was actually sig-
naling. By the time he figured it
out, he didn't need to. The student
section began screaming a count-
down.
"Yeah you could hear it, 'Five,
four, three,' " fifth-year senior
offensive lineman Mark Huyge

said. "I'm like, 'Snap the ball. Snap
the ball."'
Though there was one moment
where the crowd crescendoed
at "two," Michigan didn't have
another delay of game.
"I appreciate the fans helping
us out because we really needed
it," Robinson said. "Shout out
to the fans and I hope they'll be
ready next week."
NOTES: Former Michigan
coach Lloyd Carr was honored
before the game for his induc-
tion into the College Football
Hall of Fame.


SPECIAL TEAMS
From Page 1B
extra-point snap against Iowa;
his emphasis on technique led
to picture-perfect tackles on the
returns.
"It's probably as well as we've
played with all three phases,"
Hoke said after the game. Spe-
cial teams included.
Pelini was beside himself.
"Not locking the ball, not put-
ting the ball away when you're
carrying the football, dropping
the punt," Pelini said. "The
punter dropped the punt. You
can't do those things. I don't
know why they happened. I
don't know why we dropped the
ball.
"I don't know."
Leading up to the game, Hoke
praised Nebraska's return game
- Ameer Abdullah was the
nation's fifth-best kick returner
(31 yards per return) and 34th-
ranked punt returner (nine
yards per return). Hoke warned

against neglecting the "hidden
yardage" won and lost on special
teams.
It was still a 17-10 game when
Michigan kicked off to start the
second half. It was just like any
other kickoff.
Freshman kicker Matt Wile
drove the ball to the goal line
and backup wide receiver Ter-
rence Robinson manned his
lane.
Nebraska returner Kenny Bell
found some open space and cut
back toward Robinson, who had
squared his shoulders waiting
for Lane to come to him.
Robinson exploded toward
Bell, who never saw the 5-foot-9,
179-pound Robinson until he got
blindsided by him.
"And he fumbled the ball!"
the press box announcer shout-
ed, sounding surprised. "Michi-
gan's got it at the 33."
"I'll take it any day of the
week," said fifth-year senior
right tackle Mark Huyge. "Great
field position for an offense."
Eight plays later, junior quar-

terback Denard Robinson ran
into the endzone. 24-10.
It was still a two-touchdown
game when Nebraska lined
up to punt on its next posses-
sion. The ball was at midfield.
There was plenty of time left
for a comeback, and a good punt
from Nebraska's Brett Maher
could bury the Wolverines deep.
Maher dropped the snap.
Josh Furman, a safety who
only sees the field on special
teams, burst through the line
and blocked Maher's late punt
attempt.
"It's huge," Pelini said.
"You're just talking about giv-
ing away possessions and giving
them short fields and field posi-
tion changes. It hurt us."
On the ensuing drive, Michi-
gan stalled inside the five-yard
line. Hoke sent his field-goal
team onto the field. With a
make, Nebraska would only have
to overcome three additional
points.
But Hoke called a fake. Dileo
caught the snap, hopped up and

had plenty of room to pick up the
first down.
"It was the one that Penn
State used against us in '95,"
Hoke said of the fake. "Drew
Dileo, having him as a holder,
he's such a smart football player
and did a tremendous job with
it. If (you've) got it, you might as
well use it."
Pelini agonized.
"We had it covered," he said.
"We actually practiced that
fake. ... Somebody didn't do their
job."
The next play, redshirt sopho-
more running back Fitz Tous-
sasint scored a touchdown.
31-10.
It was again a 14-point game,
31-17, early in the fourth quarter
when Nebraska stopped Michi-
gan again on third down.
But after Will Hagerup
punted it, a flag came flying in.
Nebraska special teamer Wil
Richards was one of eight rush-
ers Pelini sent to try and create
some magic of his own. Rich-
ards couldn't block the kick, and

he landed underneath Hagerup
as his foot came down, causing
the punter to fall. The game's
momentum hung in the balance
- a "running into the kicker"
call only gave Michigan five
yards, but a "roughing the kick-
er" call would give them a first
down.
It was the latter.
"After that happened it pretty
much just shut everything off
with us," Pelini said. do
Eight plays later Michigan
scored again. 38-17.
Of course, Nebraska fumbled
the ensuing kickoff.
"Another special teams blun-
der, as the Huskers are cough-
ing it up and giving Michigan
the game," the TV announcer
roared.
Hoke said he didn't emphasize
anything new in practice. There
was no new strategy. He simply
challenged his special teams to
out-compete the guys the lined
up against - as he always does.
"They were what they're sup-
posed to be: special," Hoke said.

lowing in a seven-game losing
streak - the Wolverines' longest
ever against Ohio State. Adding
insult, the Buckeyes have won
the past four Games by a score of
114-27.
Saying there's been an empha-
sis placed on beating Ohio State
would be an understatement.
Hoke refuses to wear red - a
tradition that's lasted his whole
coaching career, which included
stops at Ball State and San Diego
State, and both of those teams
wear red. He won't call his the
Buckeyes by their full name,
"Ohio State." Instead he says,
"Ohio."
The players have picked up
Hoke's term. So did the fans
who chanted after the Nebraska
game.
"That's what he calls them, so
that's what we call them," Kovacs
said.
When the players walk into
Schembechler Hall - which has
voluntarily become their home
away from home - countdown
clocks are posted as a reminder.
They've been up ever since Hoke
took over.
"Every day," said redshirt
sophomore running back

Fitzgerald Toussaint.
"We walk in that building and
it's right there," added Huyge.
"Right in your face," Tous-
saint interrupted. "Can't miss it.
In red."
The reeling Buckeyes lost
against Penn State on Saturday,
dropping their record to 6-5.
Michigan is 9-2, with a potential
at-large BCS bowl bid on the line.
The previous 11 games this sea-
son say change is afoot.
The last time Michigan had a
better record entering The Game
was 2004. The last time the Wol-
verines had a winning streak lon-
ger than two games entering The
Game was 2006.
"Well it does give us a lot
of confidence," Huyge said of
the team's two-game winning
streak. "In the past - I don't
want to bring up past seasons -
but we haven't been playing well
in November."
That's one difference. Another
is the emphasis the coaches have
placed on improving each week,
Huyge said. After every game,
win or lose, the coaches have
focused on getting better. And
Saturday's 28-point win over a
ranked Nebraska team could be
considered the Wolverines' best
game in years.
"We knew if we got better in
November, we'd be playing better

THE QUICK BREAKDOWN
I A IZ E G / L G E The Michigan Daily football writers break down the weekend's stats that don't show up in the box score. The Denard-o-Meter measures the success of quarterback Denard
Robinson, the Beef-o-Meter judges how emotional (positive or negative) Brady Hoke was following the game, and the Hype-o-Meter measures the fans' performance.

DENARD-O-METER

BEEF-O-METER
4/ For two straight weeks, Michigan has dominated on
defense and ran down its opponents throats. The
4 defensive line got in both Martinez's and Burkhead's
Brady Hokes grill all game. Brady Hoke is one happy man.

Denards

It was solid performance: four total touchdowns, one
interception, 180 yards passing, 83 rushing. But he
didn't 'wow' too often. He seemed like he wasjust
one move away from breaking the long touchdown.

LOOKING GOOD

FEELING BLUE

SENIOR WIDE RECEIVER
MARTAVIOUS ODOMS: Welcome
back, Mr. Odoms. After breaking
his arm in fall camp Odoms didn't
do anything in the first half
of the season from a receiving
standpoint. He practiced with a
cast on his arm, forcing him to
clamp down on the ball. But now
he's finally healthy and is breaking
out of his slump. He had one catch
against Iowa, but that was just
the beginning for the diminutive
receiver. He's scored the blow-out
inducing touchdown in each of the
past two weeks. He still has just
five catches, but two of them are
for touchdowns. That's efficeincy.
The good stretch for Odoms
continued after the game as well.
At the postgame press conference,
he revealed that he beat Denard
Robinson in race two years ago.

JUNIOR RUNNING BACK VINCENT
SMITH: For a week, Smith was
Michigan's starting running
back. A 118-yard game aginst
Eastern Michigan gave him that
right. In the seven games that
have followed, Smith has just 140
yards. He'll play as a third-down
running back as was originally
intended, but with redshirt
sophomore Fitzgerald Toussaint
now fully entrenched as the lead
back, Smith's carries will continue
to be few and far between. He
didn't have a single carry against
the Cornhuskers. He had just one
against Illinois for zero yards.
Though he's also known for his
receiving ability, he hasn't had a
catch since the Iowa game. Who
would've thought a 5-foot-6, 172-
pound running back would be used
primarily as a blocking back?
