Frontrunner
extends lead as
campaign moves to
South Carolina
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily Staff Reporter
Former Massachusetts Gov.
MitRomneyscored a decisive vic-
tory in the New Hampshire presi-
dential primary last night, offering
a strong follow-up to his narrow
win in the Iowa caucuses and
becoming the first non-incumbent
Republican presidential candidate
to capture wins in both the Iowa
caucuses and the New Hampshire
primaries in the same election.
Political experts and members
of the campus community said last
night's results may have solidified
Romney's standing as the front-
runner for the Republican nomina-
tion, noting that a win in the South
Carolina on Jan. 21 primary could
make Romney nearly unstoppable
as the race continues.
With 95 percent of precincts
reporting as of 1:30 a.m., Romney
had earned 39 percent of the vote,

Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) finished
second with 23 percent, and for-
mer Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman
claimed third with 17 percent, the
Associated Press reported.
Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick
Santorum, runner-up in Iowa, and
former House Speaker Newt Gin-
grich tied for fourth with ten per-
cent of the vote.
LSA junior
Brian Rozi-
ara, external
vice chair of
the Univer-
sity's chapter
of College
Republicans,
said Rom-
ney's ability to withstand criticism
this week from Republican candi-
dates hoping to defeat him and to
meet expectations by winning by
a double-digit margin further bol-
stered his status as the Republican
frontrunner.
"I think it shows that people
across the country in both Iowa
and New Hampshire, which are
two completely different states ...
agree that Romney's vision of the
economy is the best chance for
beating Obama," Koziara said.

Researchers not
concerned about
funding issues
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily Staff Reporter
Though funding cuts by the
National Institutes of Health
may reduce medical research
efforts at colleges nationwide,
University officials said they

do not anticipate a decrease in
University research initiatives.
As part of its 2012 fiscal year
budget, NIH will lower the por-
tion of its outside researchers'
salaries - researchers who are
not employed by NIH - from
$199,700 to $179,700. While the
reduction will lower the sala-
ries of some University inves-
tigators, research officials say
they are not concerned about
its impact on the breadth or
quality of research at the Uni-

versity.
In the last fiscal year,
research expenditures at the
University increased 8.5 per-
cent - or $1.24 billion - with
a 9.8-percent growth in federal
funding largely contributing
to the increase, including an
increase in grant money by 12.6
percent from the NIH.
In an interview in Septem-
ber, Stephen Forrest, the Uni-
versity's vice president for
research, said he anticipated

a decrease in federal research
funding.
"I think I'm fairly safe in say-
ing that the growth in research
funding from the federal gov-
ernment is going to be slowed
this year quite considerably,"
Forrest said.
Antonia Villarruel, associate
dean for research and global
affairs for the University's
School of Nursing, said NIH
funding is central to the Uni-

For theDaily
Rackham student Moham-

After months of searching,
the Michigan Muslim Alumni

Students looking for their
daily caffeine fix can finally
enjoy a cup of coffee at the
newly renovated Starbucks on
South University Avenue.

After closing on Dec. 19 for
renovations, the store finished a
majority of its construction dur-
ing winter break and reopened
yesterday at 6 a.m. to serve cus-
tomers. A Starbucks spokesman
wrote in a statement that the
store improvements are a rou-
tine procedure for all Starbucks
locations.
"Remodeling is standard
course of business for Starbucks
stores and is typically done on a
regular basis in order to provide

the best experience to custom-
ers," the statement said. "We're
excited to share this store with
our customers and look forward
to welcoming them in to see it."
The store received a variety
of improvements including new
furniture and large chalkboards
for community use. The renova-
tion also incorporated a num-
ber of environmentally friendly
features like tables made from
reclaimed urban wood.

Here's to public speaking

For many students, public
speaking often invokes excru-
ciating memories of stuttering
through a class presentation.
However for the University's
chapter of Toastmasters - an
organization that helps students
improve public speaking skills
and prepares them to interact
with future employers and col-
leagues - public speaking is
exciting, competitive and an
important skill for entering the
professional world.
Rackham student Suyang
Dong, president of Toastmas-
ters, said the club caters to a
variety of interests and has a
membership comprised of both
University students and Ann

Arbor residents.
"It might surprise you that
even though this is a student
club ... it includes some staff and
faculty members, or even people
who just live locally or work
locally," Dong said. "Some stu-
dents just want to improve their
public speaking skills ... some
students ... come here wanting
to have better professionalism
in the future, to have an impact
on their community."
Students perform evaluations
on one another, and the club's
general evaluator provides feed-
back based on the Toastmaster's
official rubric, Dong said. Toast-
masters also provide an oppor-
tunity for students to compete

against one another to test their
newly developed public-speak-
ing abilities.
"We have two competitions
each year," Dong said. "We have
a competition called 'Humor-
ous Speech,' and you basically
just try to make people laugh..."
Dong said. "And for winter
semester, there's a speech called
'Inspirational,' when you try
to inspire your audience to do
something."
If students win the competi-
tion at the club level, they can
go on to compete at higher lev-
els against other Toastmasters
chapters.

General Motors and Ford
7 report strong January sales

Consumers buy
more small and
midsize vehicles
DETROIT (AP) - American
consumers are buying cars at a
brisk pace in January, continuing
sales growth that began late last
year, according to two industry
executives.
Mark Reuss, General Motors
Co.'s North American president,
said yesterday that rising sales
seen by GM and the U.S. industry
are continuingthrough the first10
days of the month.
"I think we're off to a good
start. I think the industry is off
to a good start," Reuss said at the
North American International
Auto Show in Detroit.
Erich Merkle, Ford Motor Co.'s
top U.S. sales analyst, also said
sales are going well so far this

month. Neither executive would
give specific numbers.
November and December were
among the strongest months last
year for U.S. car and truck sales.
Buyers were drawn by cheap
loans and an improving economy.
Pent-up demand also was robust
last year because many people
had to replace aging vehicles. The
average age of a car on U.S. roads
is approaching 11 years.
GM's U.S. sales rose 13 percent
last year, even faster than the
industry as a whole, which saw
sales climb 10 percent to 12.8 mil-
lion vehicles. Sales could rise by
another million this year, analysts
say.
So far, January sales are run-
ning at an annual pace of about
13.5 million cars and trucks, says
Jesse Toprak, vice president of
industry trends for the TrueCar.

Toprak said.
"They do feel better about buy-

the last three years," Toprak said.
He said people are buy-

well as midsize crossover SUVs,

Detroit can avoid state-appointed
emergency manager says Dillon

Deal between city,
union officials must
be reached by Feb.
LANSING, Mich. (AP) - The
city of Detroit has time to avoid
having a state-appointed emer-
gency manager put in place, but
city and union officials had better
move quickly to avoid significant
state intervention, state officials
said yesterday.
A deal between city and union
leaders to fix Detroit's finances, if
reached by early February, could
pre-empt the work of a state-
appointed review team that has
started digging into the city's
finances, Treasurer Andy Dillon
said.
"I'm cautiously optimistic,"
Dillon said after the 10-member
review team's first meeting. "I
think there's a very good chance
A

that they are able to cut a deal on
their own and that this review
team's work could be suspended."
The review team appointed
by Gov. Rick Snyder is trying to
determine if a financial emer-
gency exists in Michigan's largest
city. Members include Dillon, for-
mer Wayne State University Presi-
dent Irvin Reid, former Michigan
Supreme Court Justice Conrad
Mallett Jr. and former Detroit
police chief Isaiah McKinnon.
The team is expected to report
back to Snyder by late February.
The team's appointment came
after a recent preliminary review
found there was "probable finan-
cial stress" in Detroit's city govern-
ment.
The team met for the first time
yesterday and spoke afterward
with media. Eight of the nine
members said they believed the
city could still avoid having an
emergency manager appointed

The only one who did not was
Michigan Treasury Department
official Frederick Headen, who said
hedidn'twantto prejudgethesitua-
tion before getting all the evidence.
Jack Martin, an accountant
named to the review team, partici-
pated in the meeting by telephone
and wasn't present at the news
conference.
The recent preliminary review
from the state showed the city
faces a nearly $200 million general *
fund deficit for 2011 and has taken
on mounting debt to keep the city
afloat.
Auditors had said Detroit could
run out of money as early as April,
but Detroit Mayor Dave Bing said
recently that it won't because of
cost-cutting and other measures

Longer-term avoidance of a
cash crisis likely depends on con-
cessions not yet reached, Dillon
said.

Hyundai Motor Co. announced

CAMP PENDLETON, California
Marine recounts
indiscriminate
killing of Iraqis
A former squad mate of a
Marine implicated in the deaths
of 19 Iraqis testified yesterday
that after a roadside bombing, the
group raced to nearby homes, fir-
ing rounds and tossing grenades
for 45 minutes, even though he
said the Marines did not take
gunfire, come across a single
insurgent or find a weapon.
Still, former Cpl. Steven Tatum
told a military jury at the Camp
Pendleton that he felt the squad
did nothing wrong that day in the
town of Haditha in 2005, when
Marines killed 24 Iraqis, includ-
ing unarmed women and chil-
dren.
Tatum gave his account during
the trial of Staff Sgt. Frank Wut-
erich, who led the squad and faces
nine counts of manslaughter.
HAVANA
Dissident arrests
* doubled in 2011
A leading Cuban human rights
campaigner said yesterday that
brief detentions of dissidents
nearly doubled in 2011 compared
to the year before.
The report released by Eliz-
ardo Sanchez, who monitors
arrests as head of the Cuban
Commission for Human Rights
and Reconciliation, said there
were 4,123 arrests of dissidents,
nearly all of them lasting "for
several hours or days," up from
2,074 in 2010.
Cuba's government, which
calls dissidents "mercenaries"
in the service of Washington,
disputes Sanchez's statistics. A
state-run website reported last
year that several names on his
list were Bolivian and Peruvian
athletes and an 18th-century

painter. He acknowledged the
mistakes but said his people had
been tricked by security agents
pretending to be dissidents.

7.3-magnitude
earthquake causes
panic,littledamage
A powerful earthquake hit
waters off western Indonesia
early today, prompting officials
to briefly issue a tsunami warn-
ing. Panicked residents poured
into the streets, but there were
no immediate reports of injuries
or serious damage.
The U.S. Geological Survey
said the 7.3-magnitude quake
struck 260 miles (420 kilome-
ters) off the coast of Aceh prov-
ince just after midnight. It was
centered 18 miles (30 kilometers)
beneath the ocean floor.
People in the provincial capi-
tal, Banda Aceh - still deeply
traumatized by the 2004 mon-
ster quake and tsunami - were
rattled from their sleep. They
fled their homes and waited out-
side as sirens blared from local
mosques, some hopping in cars

Syrian President Bashar Assad delivers a speech at Damascus University in Damascus, Syria yesterday.
Syria's Assad defiant as

government faces

United Nations
estimates death toll
rising
BEIRUT (AP) - By turns defi-
ant and threatening, President
Bashar Assad vowed yesterday
to use an "iron hand" to crush
what he called the terrorists
and saboteurs behind Syria's
10-month-old uprising in which
thousands of people have been
killed.
In his first speech since June,
Assad showed a steely confi-
dence in the face of the uprising,
one of the bloodiest of the Arab
Spring. But opponents called it
a rambling address by a leader
who is dangerously out of touch.
Assad repeated his past
claims that a foreign conspiracy
and terrorists are driving the
revolt, not peaceful protesters
seeking to reform the country.

"We will not be lenient with
those who work with outsiders
against the country," Assad said
in a nearly two-hour speech at
Damascus University in a con-
ference hall packed with cheer-
ing supporters. He also issued a
veiled threat against those who
have yet to choose sides.
"Those who stand in the
middle are traitors," Assad said,
flanked by Syrian flags. "There
is no alternative."
The conflict in Syria is enter-
ing a new and heightened
phase, with army defectors and
some members of the opposi-
tion increasingly turning their
weapons on government targets.
The regime, in turn, has intensi-
fied an already deadly military
assault, and a U.N. official said
yesterday that about 400 people
have been killed in the last three
weeks alone, on top of an ear-

uprising
Since Dec. 23, three mysteri-
ous blasts have struck the capi-
tal, killing scores of people in
the kind of violence more com-
monly seen in neighboring Iraq.
It's unclear who is behind the
bombings, which the regime
said were suicide attacks.
The regime has blamed "ter-
rorists" for the explosions, say-
ing they proved that Syria was
fighting armed gangs. But the
opposition accuses forces loyal
to the regime of carrying out the
attacks as a way to tarnish the
uprising.
Assad also denounced the
Arab League, which sent a team
of observers into Syria in late
December to assess whether
the regime is abiding by an
Arab-brokered peace plan that
the regime agreed to on Dec.
19. On Monday, a group of Arab
League observers was report-
edly attacked in northern Syria,
suffering minor injuries.

British government to bypass legal
hurdles to Scottish independence

Cameron says he
opposes breakup of
United Kingdom
LONDON (AP) - Breaking
up is supposed to be hard to do
- but Britain's government con-
firmed yesterday it would hap-
pily offer Scotland the powers it
needs to sever centuries-old ties
to England.
Prime Minister David Cam-
eron's government said it would
sweep away legal hurdles to
allow the Scots a vote on wheth-
er their country should become
independent for the first time
since the 18th Century Act of
Union, which united Scotland
with England to create Great
Britain.
But in return, Cameron -
who opposes any breakup of the
United Kingdom, which also
includes Wales and Northern
Ireland - is urging Scotland to
make its intentions clear "soon-
er rather than later." He claims
investors are becoming increas-
ingly wary of Scottish leader
Alex Salmond's plans to delay a
vote for several years, damaging

Britain's economy.
Salmond, head of Scotland's
semiautonomous government,
has long championed inde-
pendence to allow the country
greater control over lucrative oil
and natural gas reserves in the
North Sea.
His separatist Scottish
National Party insists that win-
ning autonomy over tax and
spending policies - powers the
Scottish government doesn't
presently have - would help
replicate the economic success
of neighbors like Norway, which
has used its energy riches to
fund state pensions.
"This is a huge decision for
Scotland. This is potentially the
biggest decision we have made as
a nation for 300 years," Salmond
said yesterday, on a tour of an oil
facility in Dyce, eastern Scotland.
He insisted that Cameron
should not take any role in set-
ting out the timetable for the
crucial referendum.
"We are not going to be stam-
peded and dragooned by a Tory
prime minister in London," Sal-
mond said.
Since Scotland voted in favor
of a domestic legislative body

in 1997, its parliament has had
autonomy over education, health
and justice and can make minor
alterations to income tax. For
now, London retains primacy on
all matters relating to Britain as a
whole - including defense, ener-
gy and foreign relations.
The other nations of the U.K.
also have administrations with
some limited powers. Wales
voted for a national assembly
in 1997, while the Northern Ire-
land Assembly was created to
provide cross-community gov-
ernment in the province under
the U.S.-brokered Good Friday
peace accord of 1998.
Salmond accuses Cameron
of pushing for an early vote in
Scotland in the hope of kill-
ing off any split in the United
Kingdom. Both Cameron and
Britain's opposition leader, the
Labour Party's Ed Miliband,
plan to campaign against Scot-
tish independence.
The timing of the vote could
be crucial. Recent opinion polls
indicate rising support for inde-
pendence, after surveys showed
backing for the separation hov-
ering at about 30 percent for sev-
eral decades.

Fishermen saved after Korean
boat sinks, three still missing

Two nearby vessels
help rescue 37 as
ship caught fire
WELLINGTON, New Zea-
land (AP) - Three Korean
fishermen are missing while
another 37 were rescued today
after their vessel caught fire in
the Southern Ocean near Ant-
arctica.
The Rescue Coordination
Centre of New Zealand said the
167-foot (51 meter) Jung Woo
2 sent out a distress call early
today and two nearby fishing
vessels rushed to help out.

Center spokeswoman Sharon
Cuzens said three of the res-
cued crew were suffering from
serious burns and needed to be
moved by crane onto the rescue
boats. She said a U.S. research
vessel with onboard medical
facilities is steaming toward
the fishing boats to treat the
injured crew. It's expected to
arrive this evening.
Australian records show the
Jung Woo 2 is owned by the
Sunwoo Corporation and is
licensed to fish for Chilean sea
bass, crab and other bottom
fish. The ship was built in 1985
in Japan and is registered in
Busan, South Korea.

The ship got into trouble in
the Ross Sea about 370 miles
(595 kilometers) north of the
U.S. McMurdo Station Antarc-
tic base.
The sister ship Jung Woo
3 and another Korean vessel,
the Hong Jin 707, were able to
help out. When the U.S. vessel
Nathaniel B. Palmer arrives,
Cuzens said, it is expected to
initially treat the injured sea-
men and then put them ashore
at the McMurdo Base for more
extensive help.
The Jung Woo 2 is the second
fishing vessel within weeks to
get into trouble during the Ant-
arctic summer fishing season.

Insect Infestation
'U' needs to uphold high sanitation standards
proper sanitation and good health are vital to our campus
community. Students expect the food being served in the
residence halls to be properly prepared in a clean and germ-
free environment, and they shouldn't have to worry about bugs or
other contaminants in the food preparation area. The recent cock-
roach infestation at Ciao Down Pizzeria, a small caf6 in South Quad
Residence Hall, is an alarming issue. The University must uphold
the best possible standards in all of its facilities and needs to convey
all relevant information to the community.

The size ofgovernment's role 0

As the caucuses and prima-
ries in various states get
underway for this year's
election season, the American
people are once
again remind-
ed - as they
are every elec-
tion year - of M
the differences
between Repub- >
licans and Dem-
ocrats. Perhaps DAR-WEI
the most funda-
mental differ- CHEN
ence between
the two parties
lies in what they believe the role of
government should be. The conven-
tional Beltway wisdom states that
the GOP generally wants to reduce
the presence of government while
the Democrats typically prefer the
government to have a larger role.
In America, debates about gov-
ernment often revolve around the
idea that smaller "government" is
inherently good because it increas-
es the freedom of citizens, imme-
diately putting Democrats on the
defensive with the burden of justi-
fying any expansion of government
- ostensibly because "big gov-
ernment," by definition, deprives
citizens of necessary freedoms.
The framework of these debates is
unsurprising because America was
founded on, among other beliefs,
skepticism of government control.
Therefore, trying to expand gov-
ernment is usually a losing battle.
But the aforementioned debate
presents American citizens with
a false choice - less government
and more freedom, or more gov-
ernment and less freedom. Rarely
do Democrats make the case that a
larger government can actually lib-
erate citizens. For example, more
stringent environmental regulation
from the Environmental Protection
Agency can lead to cleaner air and
water for everyone. If the kids want
to go outside and play in the nearby
river, parents can worry less about
whether the air and water is being

contaminated by the disposal of fac-
tory waste upstream and more about
spending quality time with fam-
ily. Likewise, raising food inspec-
tion standards allows people to buy
whatever they want at the super-
market without having to worry
about health hazards every time
they purchase meat. I would argue
that expansion of government in
these two areas helps freedom flour-
ish because Americans are freed
from unnecessary burdens.
Of course, arguments can be
made about how these regulations
affect a corporation that might own
the upstream factory. The common
conservative perception of regula-
tions is that they are, unequivocally,
shackles on economic production.
Republicans trumpet this line
almost as reliably as Lucy pulls the
football away from Charlie Brown.
However, data from the recent past
says otherwise. According to a Har-
vard economics study as reported
in The Guardian in Nov. 2011, the
Clean Air Act of 1970 was directly
responsible for a 1.5% increase in
the U.S.'s 2010 gross domestic prod-
uct. The article goes on to say that
the GDP increase is likely because
healthier children grow to be more
productive as adult workers -
makes too much sense, right?
But even if the GOP has its own
data to implicate environmental
regulations as economic hindranc-
es, what's undeniable is that large
corporations have been earning
record profits in recent history -
even in President Barack Obama's
"socialist" America - according
to the operating earnings of S&P
500 companies (Interesting Note:
Record profits are not translating
much to increased hiring ... remind
me how supply-side economics
works again?). Furthermore, help-
ing out cash-laden corporations at
the expense of struggling common
folk doesn't convey a very populist
message, a message that Republi-
cans have been claiming to repre-
sent forever.
Can regulations be good for the

general public, as well as the econ-
omy and corporations? This ques-
tion is definitely a tough realization
for conservatives to swallow, and
the facts apply to other situations
too. Armed with the knowledge
that healthier people are more pro-
ductive, universal healthcare - a
monstrous enlargement of govern-
ment - seems like a good idea, eco-
nomically and otherwise. Perhaps
people can live more freely when
they don't have to worry about an
injury or disease bankrupting their
family with medical bills. On Wall
Street, government regulations and
oversight - like the new Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau -
enable average people to live with a
certain peace of mind because they
are protected from abusive and
fraudulent bank practices.
Some federal
restrictions are
good for citizens.
No one in either party wants a
tyrannical government that runs
roughshod over its citizens. But
how much better off are everyday
people if banks and corporations
are the ones doing the trampling?
One of government's basic jobs is to
protect citizens from threats of all
varieties. Preventing the govern-
ment from doing this job exposes
citizens to free market cruelties
that are not in the interest of the
general public. For example, preda-
tory lending by banks or insurance
companies that drop customers
once they need expensive treat-
ment. An effective government is
clearly vital to freedom. If "effec-
tive" necessitates "larger," so be it.

Ciao Down Pizzeria closed on Dec. 15
because of a cockroach infestation. The
caf6 is now open again to students. Univer-
sity Housing spokesman Peter Logan told the
Daily that the cafe would close permanently
if the cockroaches continued to be a problem.
This cockroach mishap never should have
happened. Between serving snacks and
meals, University dining facilities have an
obligation to students to remain clean and
sanitary. Typically, the University maintains
high standards in all of its food dining halls.
But, the recent cockroach infestation does
not abide by this standard and is unaccept-
able for a public eatery.
It is a serious matter that exterminators
were needed to kill the bugs in the food prep-
aration areas. Cockroaches are very difficult
to kill. While the extermination was safe, it's
a challenge to get rid of cockroaches without
using severe methods. The problem at Ciao
Down must be addressed as soon as possible.
Though the cafe has officially re-opened,
University Housing must be completely
certain this won't be a recurring problem.
Students who live in the residence halls
shouldn't be subject to potentially harmful

situations.
It's not only unacceptable that cockroach-
es were discovered in a popular campus
eatery. Students have every right to know
exactly what's happening when it comes to
their health and University housing. Not all
employees of Ciao Down were informed of
reasons for the closure. There is a serious
breach of trust when students don't know
about potentially hazardous situations in
University residence halls.
Last month, The Michigan Daily reported
the University's Freedom of Information
Office was charging high - and in some
cases, potentially illegal - fees for FOIA
requests. In combination with the Ciao Down
closure and failure to quickly notify students
of a sexual assault in East Quad Residence
Hall in November, it's not difficult to see a
potentially dangerous pattern. The Univer-
sity has an obligation to keep students well
informed, not pick and choose which infor-
mation should be made public.
The University must continue to uphold
its usually high standards of sanitation, and
make students aware of any problems it
encounters and of any intended remedies.

Te Big Tree's bigthree

hether cynics choose
to believe it or not, the
North American Inter-

Last week I had the privilege of attending
my first class taught by a local celebrity, English
Prof. Ralph Williams. As expected, the lecture
- an introduction to the works of Auschwitz
survivor Primo Levi - was riveting from start
to finish.
Williams introduced the lecture by skirt-
ing a direct reference to what students gener-
ally call the Holocaust and deeming it instead
"a series of happenings." He explained he was
taking extra care with his wordage, since the
term "Holocaust" carried a potentially offen-
sive implication. Before World War II, the
word was used in a strictly religious context to
denote a burnt offering to God, ostensibly given
up to atone for one's sins. Williams used this
example to emphasize the importance of the
words we use and the implications they carry,
whether intended or not.
Until then, I'd never realized that I'd been
abusing a term that certain audiences would
find deeply offensive, and I don't intend to use
it again.
Compare this to another experience from
my college years. During my sophomore year,
I was asked to lead a discussion section for
an American Culture class focused on the
struggles of Native Americans. Before I began,
I turned to my GSI and posed a question that
would help me segue into the discussion, "Isn't
it true that much of Native American culture
used to relyon 'word of mouth' ororal tradition
to pass stories and traditions from generation
to generation?"
I thought the question perfectly harmless,
so I was surprised when my GSI refused to
answer it. She told me, in so many words, that I
was being presumptuous and borderline offen-
sive, adding that in her class the students were
expected to be politically correct. Basically, my
entire opener was dead on arrival, and I spent
the rest of the section trying to salvage my
grade by walking on eggshells for the remain-
der of the presentation, proctoring what was
probably the driest, blandest discussion of my
college tenure.
The reason I bring this up is that it highlights
an issue that permeates every level of academic
thought. While the basic goal of political cor-
rectness is legitimate, the ways in which many
professors, GSIs and students try to maintain a
politically correct learning environment often
seem misguided.

My main problem with politically correct
education is its tendency to repress the same
qualities of open-mindedness and free speech
that liberalism is supposed to foster. Imagine
for a moment that a racist/sexist/otherwise
bigoted student expresses his views in class -
perhaps they use a derogatory slur, or verbalize
a belief about a certain group that's blatantly
ignorant and offensive. In a typical academic
setting, I have no doubt that such a student
would be either shouted down or ordered to
leave the class, and most of his peers would rel-
ish watching him cringe.
While professors in these situations are
probably trying to avoid the shouting match
and potential lawsuit that could result from
their students' offensive opinions, they're also
completely throwing out the same cultural
theories espoused by their own humanities
department. Psychology 101 tells us that many
of the beliefs and opinions held by an individ-
ual are the result of his or her upbringing and
education, rather than some inborn tendency
to be tolerant or bigoted. So why do universi-
ties try so hard to sanitize the environment of
their classrooms?
If personality is formed through experi-
ence, then we can't hold a bigoted student
entirely responsible for believing what they
believe. Their ethical tapestry was knit
together with the same threads as that of the
student activist - with threads of parental
guidance, education, peer influence and the
like. It follows that both the racist and the
activist deserve to have their views heard and
(if need be) corrected, especially in an envi-
ronment tailored by an institution they've
paid to teach them how to think.
Simply put, you don't clean a stained floor by
throwing a rug on top of the stain. You clean
it directly and gently, taking care not to dam-
age the surface while you scrub away the dirt.
In the same manner, Williams showed me the
hazards of a word I'd always thought to be
acceptable by explaining its historical context
and the intentions of the man who first used it
before ISeven had the chance to utter it myself.
I hope that in the future, professors and lectur-
ers follow Williams' example by doing their
jobs and teaching all their students, not just the
ones whose opinions they find most agreeable.

the top automo-
tive events of the
year. The Detroit

has waned and
waxed over the
past five years
while the future
of the Detroit
Three automak-

ANDREW
WEINER

ers - General Motors, Ford Motor
Co. and Chrysler Group - remained
unclear. Increasingly large auto
shows in Los Angeles and New York
seemed poised to leave NAIAS a
relic of Detroit's glory days.
After bailouts, plenty of layoffs,
corporate reorganizations and a
steady stream of good product, Ford,
GM and Chrysler are no longer the
butt of the automotive industry's
jokes. If it was whispered in 2011,
this year the Detroit show is a shout
- Detroit is back. Nearly every
automaker with U.S. operations set
up multi-million dollar displays in
Cobo Center this year. Nearly 30
production and concept cars were
shown off, ranging from realistic
models to pure fantasies. Here are
my top three debuts:
" 2013 Ford Fusion, Fusion Hybrid
and Fusion Energi: This one really
goes without saying. Though an iPad
application malfunction leaked a
picture of Ford's new volume sedan
several days ago. Now that we can
see the entire Fusion, all I have to
say is, "Wow."
The new Fusion is the largest
fruition of Ford's "One Ford" global
design strategy, joining the smaller
and equally attractive Fiesta and
Focus. The 2010 Fusion won sev-
eral major awards - including
Motor Trend's Car of the Year - and
enjoyed sustained high sales. I was
never a fan of the three-bar grills of
Ford's Red, White and Bold design
theme. The new design draws from
several Ford EVOS concepts, paired

with the elegant Kinetic theme Ford
has employed in its European opera-
tions for years.
The resulting sedan is stunning.
Design-wise, only the Korean Kia
Optima and Hyundai Sonata siblings
come close. It's almost an insult to
Ford's new Dearborn design studios
to mention Fusion in the same sen-
tence as the Honda Accord, Toyota
Camry or Chevrolet Malibu. The
Chrysler 200 abomination should
probably be in another paragraph.
The conventional model is offered
only in V-4 flavors, two of which uti-
lize Ford's lauded EcoBoost engine.
Statistics regarding the hybrid mod-
el's efficiency aren't final, but Ford
claims it beats out Toyota and Hyun-
dai hybrid sedans in efficiency.
Most interesting is the Energi
electric model - though I'm not sure
why incorrect spelling is in style. It
claims 100 miles per gallon equiva-
lent, and its design doesn't differ-
entiate it from the conventionally
powered Fusions. Part of the prob-
lem with electric models, like the
Chevrolet Volt and Nissan Leaf, has
been their polarizing styling. It'll be
interesting to see if Fusion Energi
sales prove my theory that Ameri-
cans do want to buy electric, they
just don't want everyone to know
they're driving an eco-mobile.
" 2013 Dodge Dart: Chrysler has
had as many marriages and messy
divorces as Newt Gingrich. The
most recent partnership with Ital-
ian conglomerate Fiat has produced
its first lovechild, the Dart - based
on, but heavily differentiated from,
the Alfa Romeo Giulietta. Aggres-
sive Dodge features work well on
this sedan, though family resem-
blance to the Charger and Challeng-
er is minimal aside from the long,
horizontal backlight.
The Dart comes late in the game
to fill Chrysler's C-segment hole.
Since the much-loved Neon was
replaced by the much-hated Cali-
ber in 2005, the Auburn Hills-based
automaker hasn't had a competitive
small car. Though Japanese com-
petitors have lost steam, the Hyun-
dai Elantra, Chevrolet Cruze and

Ford Focus have raised the small-car
bar. Ultimately, the Dart will serve
as a test to the sustainability of the
Chrysler-Fiat relationship. To put it
bluntly: The Dart has to be good -
really good.
The Auto Show
has regained its
former glory.
" Cadillac ATS: Right now, Cadil-
lac is a one trick pony - that pony
being the CTS sedan. The new ATS,
along withthe larger XTS, are poised
to continue Cadillac's renaissance
and establish it as a direct competi-
tor to Audi, BMW and Mercedes.
The German automakers all have
small, medium and large sedans, and
the ATS is Cadillac's first real vehi-
cle that can compete. Specifications
are suspiciously close to the BMW
3-series, but it's no accident. The ATS
is the first American car in decades
to directly take on the 3-series, Audi
A4 and Mercedes C-class. The next
CTS will grow to take on the BMW
5-series and Audi A6.
The ATS's design is almost iden-
tical to the CTS. From a distance,
most won't be able to tell the differ-
ence. That's not a bad thing - it's a
handsome sedan. Cadillac, however,
could have taken a bigger risk and
evolved its Art and Science theme
further. Inside, however, Cadillac's
new CUE user interface should be
simpler to use than BMW's i-drive.
In the class the ATS will compete
in, performance isvital. Two smaller
engines will be offered, but the 320
horsepower V-6 is the engine that
the Germans should fear. No doubt
we'll see an ATS-V to take on the
BMW M3 with a year.

Lowenstein said both he and

to bringing another dance club
to the downtown area. LIVE will
feature music performed by vari-

live music throughout the week,
he said.
"We're really excited about the
idea of taking over Live (at PJ's)
because this building is unlike any
other in Ann Arbor," Lowenstein
said. "There's no other dance club
that's this close to Main Street."
The Last Word, located down-
stairs from the club, is named
after a prohibition era cocktail
that originated in Detroit. Low-
enstein said they felt the name is
fitting, as the bar is going to sell
a mix of prohibitions drinks -
beverages modeled after those

School of Nursing, said NIH
funding is central to the Universi-
ty's scientific efforts, adding that
the Nursing School had just risen
to the sixth-largest beneficiary
of NIH funds in the country, up
from eighth last year.
"NIH funding is critically
important to the University and to
the School of Nursing," Villarruel
said. "It provides opportunities, it
provides resources to advance the
sciences and to make an impact
on people's lives. It's the basis for
funding discoveries and for mak-
ing that impact."
According to Steven Kunkel,
senior associate dean for research
at the University's Medical
School, the lack of concern byoffi-
cials stems from the University's
ability to absorb the additional
costs.
Still, Kunkel said the amount
of money the University now
must pay in compensation due
to the NIH reduction might
only amount to "a few hundred

Arbor community, especially
in a way that incorporates his
faith.
"One of the things that make
up communities is religious out-
lets," he said. "All of the other
faith communities in large part
have had organizations and
people who are committed to
addressing those things and the
Muslims just now are being able
to slowly address some of those
same concerns within their own
community."
Safi added that his job as
chaplain is not to head or direct
Muslim organizations on cam-
pus, but rather to advocate for
the Muslim community and
provide support for Muslim stu-
dents.
MMAA, in collaboration with
the Muslim Student Associa-
tion, began the hiring process

in September, but had been con-
templating appointing someone
for the position for a number of
years. Members of both MMAA
and MSA said they wanted to
find a chaplain who had previ-
ously experienced what it is like
to live as a Muslim student on a
college campus.

found in high-end bars around
the country.
With The Last Word, Low-
enstein said the group wants to
expand onthe successfulbartend-
ingthey've had at AlleyBar, one of
their other local businesses.
"We're going to take (what
we've done at Alley Bar) even fur-
ther," Lowenstein said. "We set
out with the goal of being Michi-
gan's best cocktail bar ... and
there's a lot of details that go into
that."
The owners said they plan to
make their own bitters, foams,
juices and aging cocktails, as well
as experiment with molecular
mixology in creating drinks.
Lowensteinsaid renovationson
the spaces are not quite finished,
and that he and his partners are
giving both business spaces a gen-
eral facelift, including new paint
and decor before the businesses
open in February.
"LIVE will feel like the same
thousand dollars," noting that
in the past only about 10 percent
of Medical School researchers
were receiving the full amount of
money allotted by NIH.
"It's not the end of the day, it's
just a little bit of an irritant more
than anything," Kunkel said.
"This is just a blip on the radar.
This is not going to be anything
that's going to make us re-think
how we do grants or anything."
To bridge the gap in the sala-
ries of researchers impacted
by the $20,000 NIH reduction,
Kunkel said chairs or deans will
need to use funding within their
department budgets to com-
pensate investigators. He added
he believes the Medical School
will find the funds to maintain
researchers' salaries, which the
University negotiates yearly.
"There'll be some repercus-
sions, no doubt about that," Kun-
kel said. "As long as they don't
reduce it more and more every
year ... this one-time reduction
probably will be able to be assimi-
lated into the budget."
Kunkel said the Medical
School is not in "crisis mode" yet,
strove to find a chaplain who
students feel comfortable turn-
ing to for guidance about their
spiritual needs and who can to
serve the interests of the Mus-
lim student body.
Adelhadi added that student
feedback was an important com-
ponent of the hiring process.
Students in MSA were given
the opportunity ask Safi ques-
tions about his plans as chaplain
while he was still going through
the interview process, and Adel-
hadi said students have been
communicating with Safi since1
he took the position last week.
"We can already see the dif-
ference it is making on stu-
dents lives," she said. "People
are already reaching out to him
and trying to make connections
with him. They are seeing the
value that this person can bring
to campus."1
Annie Sajid, vice president of
external relations for MSA, said
she has observed Safi at vari-;

ous MSA events and noticed his
commitment to interacting with1
students and facilitating dia-i
logue.
Sajid added that because Safi
is the first person to take on the
position, there is some uncer-
tainty about how exactly he can
best serve Muslim students on
campus. However, she said Safi'si

place, just fresher when you walk
in," Lowenstein said. "The Last
Word will definitely feel different
than Gracie's"
Apart from the change in decor,
Lowenstein and his partners are
also changing how customers can
access each business. Customers
visiting Live at PJ's and Goodnite
Gracie could previously move
freely between the two business-
es, but the new establishments
will have separate entrances
with no customer access between
them.
Lowenstein said he and his
partners want to ensure each
business has its own identity.
"We'll have some crossover in
terms of demographic and people
that are going back and forth and
drinking," Lowenstein said. "But
in terms of the identities, they're
not just going to be one ... and in
the end they might be separate
people that come here and come
there, kind of like (BTB) Cantina
and (Good Time) Charley's."
but added he is concerned that
this year's reductions might be
the start of a long-term effort by
the federal government to shirk
responsibility for funding scien-
tific research.
"This first round - it's raised
some eyebrows, but it's nothing
that's going to be something that
we can't handle," Kunkel said.
"I think just what people start
thinking about is that if they low-
ered it this year ... will they be
coming next year to do it again
and the next year to do it again."
Often, a University researcher
will apply for three or more grants
- which can be worth upward of
a few million dollars each over
several years - and write off20 to
30 percent of his or her salary on
each grant, Kunkel said.
The University's Medical
School is the country's fifth-
largest beneficiary of NIH funds,
according to Kunkel. The Uni-
versity's latest available research
report for the 2010 fiscal year
reported that the University
received more than $507 million
- or 44.5 percentoftotal research
expenditures - from NIH.
approaches his new role is eas-
ing the transition.
"I appreciate that he is so
open minded and willing to
learn and be engaged with com-
munity members," Sajid said.
In addition to offeringspiritu-
al guidance to Muslim students,
Safi will also communicate with
the University about the needs
of the Muslim population.
"We have always had to rely
on individual students' relation-
ships with the administration
and often times those bonds can
break when people graduate,"
Abheladi said. "With the chap-
lain here we have someone who
can come to know the University
very well and become that face
for the Muslim community."
Safi said the implementation
of the chaplain position is a nat-
ural and necessary development
for the Muslim community on
campus, adding he is eager to
continue to work with students
and other individuals - both

within the Muslim faith and
beyond - who are committed to
improving society.
"We want to work with peo-
ple," he said. "We don't want to
tell people what to do or impose
anything on people. We want to
work with them to address con-
cerns they already have. That
is the goal of what a chaplain is
supposed to do."

Incoming officials
discuss upcoming
plans
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
Under a new name and a new
semester, the Student Assem-
bly of the Central Student Gov-
ernment - formerly known as
Michigan Student Assembly -
made appointments for positions
at their first meeting of 2012 last
night.
Business senior Matthew Eral
and LSA junior Aditya Sathi
were both re-elected as chair
and vice-chair of the Assem-
bly for semester-long terms.
The Assembly also elected the
chairs and vice-chairs of CSG's
standing committees - Finance,
Rules, Resolutions, and Com-
munications - which are also
semester-long positions. All
eight of the chair and vice-chair
positions were uncontested.
Eral said he and Sathi are
looking forward to bridging the
gap between students and CSG
and better cater to the needs of
the campus community, adding
that the organization's recent
ROMNEY
From Page 1A
For Koziara, asewell as for many
political experts, the margin of
victory reaffirmed the appeal of
Romney's economic credentials
in an election cycle that will like-
ly center on improving the econ-
omy. Though his rivals took aim
at the former Massachusetts gov-
ernor this week for his corporate
history, Koziara said he remained
the most viable economic candi-
date.
"At the end of the day, Mitt
Romney understands job cre-
ation much better than President
Obama," he said.
The race for the Republican
nomination now turns to South
Carolina, a battleground for the
candidates because of its robust
socially conservative Republican
base, Political Science Prof. Ken
Kollman said.
STARBUCKS
From Page 1A
LSA senior Sarah Beery and
Business senior Kristen Stack
said they typically meet for cof-
fee at the South University Star-
bucks once a week. Both said
they like the visual appeal of the
updated store.
"It looks more uniform,"
Beery said. "Before there was
a mismatch of a bunch of dif-
ferent chairs and tables, but

name change serves as a founda-
tion for reinvention and invigo-
ration of the group.
"(CSG), in the students' eyes,
maybe hasn't been the most
effective in years past," Eral said.
"Starting with a new name and a
lot of new great initiatives right
off the bat will help give us a lit-
tle bit of new momentum that I
think student government hasn't
had in a couple years."
Eral said his and Sathi's pri-
mary objective is to increase
transparency and make the ini-
tiatives of the Assembly more
visible to the campus commu-
nity.
In addition to working toward
increasing awareness, Sathi said
his and Eral's elections provided
them with the opportunity to
work with the Representative
Outreach Task Force - a group
created last year to ensure
representative accountabil-
ity and improve communication
throughout CSG.
Though the Assembly
achieved quorum at every meet-
ing last semester, many repre-
sentatives did not attend the
meetings. Sathi said the Repre-
sentative Outreach Task Force is
dedicated to "making the legisla-
tive branch live up to its expecta-
While Kollman called the New
Hampshire primary "an impor-
tant opportunity" for Romney to
showcase his strength, he said
the South Carolina contest could
test his broader appeal to the
Republican electorate.
"You sort of want to know how
someone like Romney will do
there, because on (social issues)
he might not be as appealing in
a place like South Carolina as he
would be in New Hampshire,"
Kollman said in an interview
before yesterday's primaries.
Though the race for the
Republican presidential nomina-
tion is gaining momentum, some
University students said they are
not paying much attention to the
contest.
LSA sophomore Vishruta
Kulkarni said she had not fol-
lowed the primary closely
because she found it difficult to
compare the candidates at this
point in the election.
now everything looks clean.
It's a lot more modern, which
is nice."
"I love (the renovations). It
looks beautiful," Stack added.
Stack said the updates are
practical, particularly in provid-
ing additional seating for stu-
dents to study.
"I think there's more seat-
ing, which is one of the things
we were most concerned about,
especially around finals time
there's never seating around
here," she said.

tions."
Sathi added that his re-elec-
tion serves as reassurance for his
work in CSG thus far, and that is
excited for the new semester.
"Itshowsuthat I've done my job
" he said. "I think I'm doing the
right things, and I need to con-
tinue in that direction."
Eral expressed similar antici-
pation for the semester.
"I'm definitely honored that I
got re-elected by the Assembly,"
he said. "I'm excited to serve
again for another semester."
At the meeting, CSG President
DeAndree Watson discussed
the recent name change, noting
that the organization is still in a
transition period. He encouraged
representatives to use the name
CSG more frequently around
campus.
Watson said he is optimis-
tic about students' adoption of
the name change, adding that at
yesterday's Winterfest, students
already expressed awareness
of the name change and CSG's
newly formed objectives.
"I think the fact that (stu-
dents) are aware of what we do is
a positive sign," Watson said.
-Danielle Stoppelmann and Emily
A. Kasti contributed to this report.
"It's a huge spectrum, and all
the candidates are on different
parts of it," Kulkarni "It's just
really hard to compare because a
lot of things they think are simi-
lar and then there are things that
are completely opposing."
Kulkarni said she would follow
the election more closely once the
Republicans nominate their can-
didate and the general election
begins this fall.
LSA sophomore Meagan
Strickland, echoed Kulkarni's
sentiments, adding she will begin
following once the amount of
information stopped becoming
"completely overwhelming."
"We're just in a really crucial
point of almost like rebuilding
and getting things done," she
said. "It's kind of like the climb-
ing out the hole, so it's really
important to have somebody in
office who's goingto dowhatthey
say they're going to do and make
strides."
University alum Sarah Chang,
who graduated in 2007, said she
is a regular customer at the Star-
bucks location on South Univer-
sity, and said she particularly
took note of the aesthetic chang-
es to the store and the additional
seating.
"I love the colors and the fact
that there's a lot more space,"
Chang said. "It seems like
they've maximized the space
very effectively and the ambi-
ance is really comfortable and
warm."

'Tinker Tailor'
unsettles with Cold
War vibes
By EMILY BOUDREAU
Daily Arts Writer
"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,"
despite being a movie about
spies, doesn't
rely on loud **g ;
explosions or
buckets of fake Tinker Tailor
blood. InsteadS
the film is built Soldier Spy
on intense bits At Quality16,
of dialogue Rave and the
and stealthy Michigan
exchanges
between actors Focus Features
and the camera
to create an atmosphere of sus-
pense and fear.
Set during the Cold War peri-
od, the movie revolves around
George Smiley (Gary Oldman,
"Red Riding Hood"), dragged
out of retirement to hunt down
a mole hiding in the top tiers
of British intelligence. Smiley
weaves himself into the web of
secrets and lies, entering a world
in which everyone wears two
faces.
The story is complicated and

full of twists. The general flow
of the narrative also relies on
camera shots of small details like
the arrangements of chess pieces
or picking out a face in a photo-
graph. It's a story that requires a
lot of patience and attention.
Nevertheless, the movie is
beautifully crafted and evokes its
chosen era seamlessly. The Cold
War was a period of fear and
uncertainty, of internal struggle
and mistrust of basic instincts.
Instead of relying on tropes like
old news footage to emphasize
the atmosphere or provide a
sense of historical background,
director Tomas Alfredson ("Let
the Right One In") merges the
plot with its Soviet-era context.
The costumes, the setting and
even the characters emit a tense,
frozen sensibility.
Oldman in particular man-
ages to encapsulate this complex
conflict within his character.
His eyes, magnified by his large
glasses, convey exactly how
sharply his mind works. How-
ever, the intelligence with which
he approaches his job is under-
mined by his drab appearance
- a reminder that the best spies
are not necessarily the ones with
the flashy gadgets and fancy cars
but rather the ones most easily
forgotten.

In some respects, Smiley's
anonymity and the faceless
enemy whose steps he traces
provoke a striking and more dis-
turbing form of violence than
the traditional shoot-out scenes
in spy movies. When some-
one is killed, there's no fight
or struggle. Importantly, this
means there is no clear distinc-
tion between good and evil, no
identifiable villain. Each side is
just as bad as the other, leaving
behind their own share of car-
nage.
Though violent and in some
respects disturbing, "Tinker
Tailor Soldier Spy" is, at least
cinematographically, a beautiful
movie. A scene with a reflection
in a black-marble desktop stands
out, hinting at duality and the
falseness of perception. And yet
the beautiful, stilled appear-
ances serve as reminders that
the world is unstable, that just
because something is seen does
not make it true.
Above all, the film builds up a
fear of the unknown, or rather,
causes that kind of innate fear to
surface in the film's characters
and in the audience. The story
is told masterfully but is full of
small details. "Tinker Tailor Sol-
dier Spy" is not meant to enter-
tain, but to unsettle.

By EMILY BOUDREAU
Daily Arts Writer
Some people never grow up.
Yet "Young Adult" demonstrates
that being young at heart is
not always a
healthy way
to retain the
charm of one's Young Adult
earlier days.
Mavis (Char- At Quality
lize Theron, 16, Rave and
"The Road") is the State
a recent divor-
cee who lives Paramount
in Minneapolis
(or the "Mini-Apple" as it's affec-
tionately called). She's work-
ing on the last installment of a
"Gossip Girl"-esque series and
decides to return to her home-
town, a place she claims to have
escaped. She tries to rekindle
her relationship with her high
school boyfriend Buddy (Patrick
Wilson, "The League"), who has
since married and recently had
a baby girl. While there, Mavis,
a former mean girl, strikes up
a friendship with Matt (Pat-
ton Oswalt, "A Very Harold and
Kumar 3D Christmas"), a former
nerd. Through this new friend-
ship and by returning to her
hometown, Mavis begins to face
her own issues.
Theron fits perfectly into her
role. Mavis is dazed and lives
in her own world, a teenage
fantasy in which she is still the
prom queen. However, Theron
doesn't just allow the character
to remain a typical mean girl.
Theron's Mavis is conscious of
her world falling apart, and that
her fantasy and denial of the real
world is merely a way for her to
survive.
Yet Mavis's vulnerabil-
ity doesn't take away from her
being, first and foremost, an
unlikeable character. As painful
as it is to watch her crumble, to
watch her enter into one embar-
rassing social situation after
another, it's impossible to for-

Blue faces mirror image at Crisler Behind Enemy Lines

Daily Sports Editor
On Wednesday night at the
Crisler Center, a team will take
the floor that features a com-
plicated offense and possesses
a 1-3-1 zone

The Wolver-
ines will see
somewhat of a mirror image when
they try to win their 11th-straight
game at home over visiting North-
western (1-2 Big Ten, 11-4 overall).
Though different from Michigan
coach John Beilein's system, the
Princeton offense that the Wild-
cats' Bill Carmody runs does have
some similar principles.
The Princeton system empha-
sizes constant motion, lots of
screens and, like Beilein's offense,
plenty of back-door cuts. It's a
disciplined attack, and the Wol-
verines will have even more dif-
ficulty defending Northwestern's
version of it - Beilein called Car-
mody "as innovative as anyone
that runs it," adding more twists
than most other Princeton looks.
t The Wildcats haven't played
since losing to Illinois at home
last Wednesday. They've had a
full week to prepare for Beilein's
intricacies, while Michigan (3-1,
13-3) has had just two days since
playing Wisconsin.
"It's hard to emulate the speed
and just the precision of (the
Princeton offense)," said senior
guard Stu Douglass. "It's hard

Freshman guard Trey Burke will be tasked with slowing down Northwestern freshman Dave Sobolewski tomorrow.

one or two days.... We've done
a pretty good job with the short
time we've had. I'm not too wor-
ried about it.
"We've just got to stick to our
principles, and I think we'll be
alright."
The last time freshman point
guard Trey Burke faced a Princ-
eton attack was a year ago, when
his dominant Northland High
School team was getting blown
out in the state finals by Cincin-
nati LaSalle.
The Wolverines hope the inex-
perienced Burke will fare bet-
ter against Northwestern. The
Columbus native said the team
had two separate film sessions
on Tuesday to help prepare for
the challenges that the Wildcat
offense presents.
Northwestern's defense, too,
should be familiar - the Wild-
cats are the only other conference
team to use the 1-3-1 with any
regularity, though they've been
favoring man-to-man the last
couple years,just like the Wolver-
ines.
And after getting the best of
Badger veteran Jordan Taylor,
Burke will find himself matched

up against a fellow freshman on
Wednesday night. Like Michigan,
Northwestern was concerned
about replacing a star point guard
cominginto the season. But just as
Burke has made fans forget about
Darius Morris, Wildcat freshman
Dave Sobolewski has played well
filling in for Juice Thompson.
Sobolewski has displayed a
steady hand, committing just 14
turnovers and ranking third in
the country with a 4.07 assist-
to-turnover ratio. Beilein said
Sobolewski has done a good job
of just fitting in instead of trying
to do too much, a task made easier
by the presence of forward John
Shurna and wing Drew Crawford.
The pair is the highest-scoring
duo in the Big Ten. Shurna leads
the conference in scoring with
18.7 points per game, while Craw-
ford - son of longtime NBA ref-
eree Danny Crawford - is third,
putting in 17.3 points per game.
One of the two has led North-
western in scoring in 13 of the
team's 15 games.
The senior Shurna has been
a threat for awhile now, though
Michigan limited him to just four
points at Crisler Arena last sea-

son, though he had just come off
a concussion. But Crawford has
taken his game up a notch this
year.
"You kind of play to his ath-
leticism, but he can really shoot
the ball really well too," Doug-
lass said. "We've got to just stay
focused, but with Crawford,
we've got to specifically (focus on
him)."
Northwestern has struggled in
Big Ten play this season, despite
many predicting this edition of
the Wildcats to become the first
in program history to make the
NCAA Tournament. But Michi-
gan has struggled against Car-
mody recently, falling at home
two years ago and getting beaten
handily in Evanston each of the
last two years. For that reason,
Beilein said he isn't worried about
a letdown after the big Wisconsin
victory.
"You would (worry) if it was
a team that did not have Zack
Novak and Stu Douglass in that
locker room," Beilein said. "It's
not like we have been beating
them every year. I think our kids
will come in this one ready to
play. I'm not worried about that."

Arnold finding her
way into M' offense

Merrill back on track after suspension

By MICHAEL LAURILA
Daily Sports Writer
During the Michigan-Ohio
State women's basketball game
last Saturday at the Crisler Cen-
ter, junior forward Rachel Sheffer
picked up two early fouls and was
forced to sit.
Junior Sam Arnold was called
to duty from the bench to take
Sheffer's spot on the floor. At
6-foot-4, Arnold was given the
difficult task of facing off against
two big Buckeyes - 6-foot-5
sophomore center Ashley Adams
and 6-foot-2 sophomore forward
Martina Ellerbe.
i But Arnold never faltered,
finishing with a season-high 13
points and scoring seven straight
for the Wolverines at one point
in the first half. That surge from
Arnold, combined with eight
points from fellow bench player
junior Kate Thompson, allowed
Michigan to remain in control
and take a seven-point lead into
halftime.
"When you are in the game, you
have to be able to do something,"
said Michigan coach Kevin Bors-
eth after the victory. "When Sam
comes in, we rely on her under the
basket. Rachel has been doing it
(all season) and now tonight Sam
did it. That's the difference for
us. Those kids have to be able to
come in and contribute."
Not only was Arnold an offen-
sive force to be reckoned with,
she also was a presence in the
paint defensively. In her 17 min-
utes of playing time, she totaled
two rebounds, a block and a steal,
all without a personal foul.
Since the beginning of Big Ten
play on Dec. 30, Arnold has aver-
aged 7.3 points per game, while
shooting an impressive 48 per-
cent from the field, playing just 12
minutes per game. Her ability to
come in and stay out of foul trou-
ble has been crucial for Michigan
in games that have come down to
the wire.
Though Arnold is usually the
first Michigan forward to come
off the bench, Sheffer's 13 points

and four rebounds per game is
difficult to match. However, at
just 6-foot-2, Sheffer and the
other Wolverine starters have
struggled in the paint against
some of the bigger teams they've
played. One example was Michi-
gan's loss to then-No. 6 Maryland
on Nov. 30, when it was out-
rebounded by 23.
"Coming off the bench, I know
my role is to get in there and give
a spark and make the most out of
every minute I'm in there for,"
Arnold said. "If my shots are fall-
ing, that's awesome, and guards
like Courtney (Boylan) do a great
job of getting me the ball."
As the season progresses,
Arnold can only get more con-
fident if this leap in production
continues. She's looked more
comfortable around the basket
since the beginning of Big Ten
play, and that only continued
against Ohio State.
Because of her size and the
role she plays in the paint, teams
have tended to allow Arnold open
looks from outside the arc. She is
shooting a respectable 40 percent
from deep this season, which,
compared to her career mark
of 32 percent, has been a leap in
itself.
"I think just her energy, and
even her confidence yesterday in
practice was better," Boylan said.
"Sam has done a really good job
for Rachel every time she's come
in, but the other day (in practice)
she was just hitting shot after
shot, so she definitely needed that
(confidence boost)."
Whether or not this rise in
production will continue is diffi-
cult to say. But if Arnold can keep
producing offensively, opposing
teams will have to start to pay the
junior a little more attention in
their scouting reports.
On Thursday, when Michigan
squares off against Penn State,
she will be critical in the paint,
-as the Nittany Lions boast two of
the best post players in the con-
ference in sophomore forward
Talia East and junior center Nicki
Greene.

Jon Merrill cracked a big
smile at Michigan's hockey
practice on Monday afternoon.
There wasn't anything in par-
ticular to get excited about - it
was just ordinary warm-ups.
The sophomore defenseman
went through the normal drills,
passing a puck back and forth
with a teammate before taking a
shot on goal.
The team was focused on the
upcoming Ohio State series, but
you couldn't see any disappoint-
ment on Merrill's face left over
from the shootout loss on Satur-
day against Lake Superior State.
For him, the weekend meant
just one thing: his first time in a
maize sweater since Michigan's
Frozen Four appearance back in
April.
Merrill was suspended from
the team at the beginning of
October for an unspecified vio-
lation of team rules. In Novem-
ber, he was permitted to start
skating with the team at prac-
tices again, but a timetable for
full reinstatement was never
specified.
After months of deliberation
and communication between
Michigan coach Red Beren-
son and Athletic Director Dave
Brandon, Merrill's suspension
was finally lifted on Friday
afternoon.
"It was all timing," Berenson
said of the decision to reinstate
Merrill. "It was our athletic
director getting back from the
Sugar Bowl, Jon getting back
from the USA program, and us
getting all the information we
needed to put together."
Merrill spent the winter
break skating with Team USA
for the World Junior Champion-
ship. From Dec. 26 to Jan. 6, he
was out of communication with
anyone from Michigan.
That is, until approximately
1:30 p.m. on Friday, when Mer-
rill got a phone call.
"When I left for World
Juniors, (the possibility of
returning) was still just indefi-
nite," Merrill said. "I got back
Thursday night, didn't hear
anything. (I) finally found out

was out of my routine, it was
weird. I didn't know what to do
not going to practice everyday.
Now, getting back in the routine,
going on the road this weekend,
it'll be fun."
In the fall, there were rumors
of Merrill bolting for the OHL in
lieu of playing for the Wolver-
ines. But now he claims that it
was never a real possibility.
"I made a commitment to
coach Berenson and the Univer-
sity of Michigan and I thought
(staying) was the right thing to
do," Merrill said. "Not only the
right thing for me as a person,
but for the team, to stick it out
and face the punishment.
"I'm glad I did, and I think
I'm a better guy for it now."
Merrill is hesitant to call him-
self the solution for some of the
Wolverines' problems over the
past few months, but there's
little doubt that one of the coun-
try's top-tier defensemen can
have a huge impact on a team
that's faced its fair share of trib-
ulations this season.
Berenson calls Merrill a
"puck-moving defenseman," and
Merrill echoed those sentiments
by saying he likes controlling
the pace of the game and staying
consistent night after night - all
things Michigan has been strug-
gling with.
During last weekend's games,
Merrill skated with junior
defenseman Lee Moffie. Until
Berenson decides otherwise,
Merrill expects the pairing to
remain the same.
But Merrill doesn't like look-
ing too far down the road, be it
about his line-mates or whether
he'll stay at Michigan for a full
four years. Today, he is nothing
but grateful to Berenson and the
athletic department for allow-
ing his return to the squad.
"When you lose hockey like
that, it really makes you think
about the decisions you make
off the ice that influence your
hockey career," Merrill said.
"You never think things you do
off the ice can take the game you
love away from you so quickly.
"Now I'm in a place where
I'll do anything to keep playing
hockey and I won't make any
mistakes like that."

ADM SCHNITZER/Daily
Sophemore defenseman Jon Merrill played his first game af the seasan Friday.

I was playing on Friday (and) I
was ecstatic. I couldn't believe
it, because I had no idea."
The first person Merrill
called was his father, who was
almost in tears at the news that
his son would be taking the ice
at Yost Ice Arena for the first
time all season.
Merrill may have been out
of action for two months, but
he wasn't forgotten. All Friday
afternoon, teammates tweeted
their excitement about having
Merrill back in a Michigan uni-
form, and gave him countless
well-wishes in the hours leading
up to the game.
Michigan fans hadn't forgot-
ten him either - Merrill started
his first shift on Friday with the
Yost crowd chanting his name.
He didn't waste time making up
for the 24 games he missed, tal-
lying his first points of the year
with two assists.
Merrill admitted to a few
nerves during his first couple

of shifts, but Berenson was
never concerned about Merrill's
adjustment back to game mode.
"He's a special player," Beren-
son said. "I've got a lot of confi-
dence in him. I wasn't surprised
when he came back and fit right
in.
"He's been practicing with us
the last six weeks, so he's in sync
with our team. Now (that) he's
back in the fold, he'll be one of
our top defensemen."
Until the suspension, Merrill
had never gone any extended
period of time without playing
hockey. He had been injured
before, but even then he was
still in the locker room and sur-
rounded by the team on a daily
basis.
Merrill was away from all
of that during the first part of
his suspension - and he didn't
know what to do with himself.
"As a hockey player, you love
your routine, you love consis-
tency," Merrill said. "When I

random student interview

by kaitlin williams
Welcome to the Random Student
Interview, where we laud your
accomplishments to the point of
self-deprecation.
Hey! How's your first day back at
school going?
It's good. I'm done for the day.

Yes

- No

Wow. Isn't it, like, noon? That's
awesome.
Actually, it's one o'clock, but yes.
How long do you think the University's tenure
probationary period should be?
8-10 years Other oh really? Already? Time flies
when you're sleep deprived. I
<4 years woke up this morning and seri-
0+ years --ously considered dropping my
first class, especially after the girl
next to me kept yawning morning
breath all over me.
4-8 years Oho
I had to zone out and go to my
happy place. Is your schedule
pretty set?
It is. I got all my classes, no waitlists.
t g t pud And I'm actually not taking that
many credits this semester.
So you don't actually hate your-
- self for taking early classes?
No. I love waking up early, and then
s n f r . w rks b getting everything over with so I
have the afternoon.
So what are you going to do with
your free afternoon?
I'm going to go home. I have some
" "end" sa q n t stuff to clean up and work that I
have to do for classes on Friday.
Wow. You're makingme look bad.
You're going to go be productive
the rest of the day? I'd just go to
the Union, get a pretzel and nap ...

So did you break any New Year's
resolutions already?
Um ... no. I never, ever do New
Year's resolutions. I don't want to.
I've never done it.
I made a resolution not to make
a resolution and I've messed that
up already.
(Laughs)
What are you looking forward to
most in 2012? A.k.a. "the begin-
ning of the end."
Well, this is just a big year in general
for grades and everything - apply-
ing to grad schools and then medi-
cal school. So I just have to make
sure I'm really focused and study
a lot this semester, but at the same
time really enjoy myself and have
fun because, unfortunately, being a
senior next year, everything's going
to come to a head.
ti
So you're looking forward to
being in school forever? You are
of another breed, my friend.
Yeah.
So, did you watch the Sugar
Bowl?
I did watch it. I watched the first
half and then the overtime part. I'm
not a big football fan.
Did you do anything ceremonious
for your game-watching?
No, not really.

My friend and I cracked some
Mike's Hard Lemonades. We like
to keep it classy and slightly alco-
holic.
I saw on Facebook
someone opened
champagne right
after the game.
Oh, that's funny! Champagne
would also do the trick. So do you
follow politics at all?
A little bit.
So do you care about the Iowa
caucus results?
Not really.
Do you knowwho won?
I don't know anything.
I should care because
it's the first year I'm
going to be able to vote
in a presidential elec-
tion, but ...
Oh, me too! Unless you count
how I convinced my dad to vote
my way in 2008. It was a crown-
ing achievement in my young
life, voting by father proxy.
Oh, that's good.
So where do you think you stand
this year?
I'll for sure have to do research. It's
less than a year now, so I'll definitely
get on that.
Well, between waking up early
in the morning, cleaning all
afternoon, studying at night
and applying to grad schools,
you should be able to kick back
after that and peruse The Michi-

The Henderson House is the only
University-owned co-op in Ann
Arbor. Founded in 1942, Henderson
rests on the corner of Hill Street and Olivia
Avenue. Its occupants? 28 women. That's
right - ladies only.
What comes to mind when you think of
a co-op? Tofu? Mason jars? Red Solo cups
in peculiar locations? During my visit to
the wholesome Henderson House Co-op,
however, there wasn't Mason jar or Solo
cup in sight. Maybe there was some tofu in
the fridge, but I didn't check.
Despite the large number of residents,
the house was almost completely quiet
when I visited last semester, probably due
to the fact that it was right around the end
of finals week.
I chatted with the Henderson House
Resident Director and Ross School of Busi-
ness senior Kathryn Yaros, whose princi-
pal duties include managing the house and
keeping the community happy and civil.
Instead of house ragers and bar-hopping
excursions, Henderson women have an
annual barbeque with University alums.
They eat a Thanksgiving dinner surround-
ed by hand-painted turkeys. They attend
G-Men a cappella shows and gaze together
at holiday lights. The women of Hender-
son are mature and refined - although
if they do come stumbling back tipsy and
high heel-less to the house at 3 a.m., Yaros
expressed one wish.
"Just please, please, please don't forget
your keys."

by Katie Steen
And then there are "crafternoons" - a
house activity as cutesy as the name. Yaros
described these as relaxing afternoons
during which the residents, well, craft.
While twee-haters may scoff at the idea
of crafternoons, the Henderson tradition
of "swells" is something to make even
the harshest skeptic utter an involuntary
"aww."
Swells, Yaros said, are little notes the
girls stick in a designated shoebox. They
are read aloud at the co-op's weekly meet-
ing and allow the women to share with
each other why every girl in the house is
the best person ever.
If your heart doesn't melt at the idea of
getting a sticky note telling you you're the
best dinner cook replacement a girl could
ask for, there's another incentive for par-
ticipating in swell culture - give a swell
and you're entered into a gift card raffle.
While there's a definite community
aspect to life at Henderson, the girls aren't
into the idea of communal filth. Like Inter
Cooperative Council co-ops (Ann Arbor
living communities run by the residents
who live in them), each member must per-
form a total of five hours of chores per
week - including cooking dinner, clean-
ing rooms in the house or even cleaning
the Internet (essentially, going through
software and doing other computer-relat-
ed tasks that probably wouldn't have made
much sense if Yaros had tried explain-
ing them to me). Unlike most ICC co-ops,
though, makeup work - called "odd jobs"

places you're living in."
So is this what makes Henderson specif-
ically Solo cup-free? For the record, I did
see some shot glasses, but they were clean __
and neatly arranged. Maybe it was due to
the house's explicit banning of alcohol in
common areas, or the strict enforcement
of rules and chores. Maybe it's because
it's all-female. Or maybe Henderson just
attracts a certain type of person.
I was interested, then, in comparing
Henderson to the co-op I consider to have
the most squeaky-clean reputation in the
ICC, Gregory House - an entirely sub-
stance-free living environment.
I spoke to current Gregory resident and
Rackham student Rocky Fischer. Like
Davenport, he basically adores his co-op.
Fischer described Gregory as a fully-
functioning and overall neat place to live.
Like at Henderson, there is definitely a
community aspect, but it can vary based
on differences in residents' ages as well as
the academic term. House social events,
while not terribly important, include the
occasional picnic in the Arb.
Fischer said he appreciated the sub-
stance-free policy and partially attrib-
uted that to the house cleanliness. Maybe
Henderson isn't the only co-op that has
responsible people who will do their work.
"In general, things work," Fischer said.
"On a regular basis, yeah, people do their
job."
NOLAN LOH/Daily Because the co-op is owned by the Uni-
versity, living in Henderson has its perks.

"Baddest Bitch," has amassed over 1.4 mil-
lion views.
Oakley began vlogging in an attempt to
keep in touch with friends going to school
elsewhere. But not long after he began
vlogging, one of his videos hit 100 views.
"That was the first time it hit me,
because I was like, 'I don't have 100
friends,' " Oakley said.
His fame only grew from there. Last
February, Oakley posted a video of himself
walking around Ann Arbor, focusing on the
fairy doors interspersed around Kerrytown.
He now receives about 50,000 views for
every video he posts.
Hearing numbers like this may make it
easy to associate vloggers like Oakley -
who vlogs about being friends with Perez
Hilton and meeting Lady Gaga - with
actual celebrities. And to their fans, they
really are celebrities.
"If I saw (John Green) in real life ... it'd
be crazy," Dolsen said. "I almost look up
to him as a role model, he's got his life in
order. But it's not just me, they definitely
are celebrities to a lot of viewers."

Tubers like the Vlogbrothers is that they
are normal people, but they're doing

hundreds of thousands of people think is
worth their time.
Oakley distinguishes himself from other
vloggers in the Nerdfighter community by
maintaining a connection with as many of
his fans as possible, even though he has
never met the majority of his followers.
YouTube's comment feature and other
social media outlets allow for interactions
between Oakley and his fans that aren't
possible in other forms of communication,
he said.
"I spend time commenting on YouTube
comments ... If someone @-posts me on
Twitter, I'll usually send them a direct
message," he said. "I feel like it's impor-
tant. I don't want to be that YouTuber that
is above people."
The connection between fans and celeb-
rities are strengthened through social
.onedia and YouTube, but in reality, there
isn't much evidence of any relationship.
But that doesn't mean popular YouTubers'
comments don't impact their fans.
From fan to fame
LSA senior Chellie Carr is a fan-turned-
vlogger.
Carr started vlogging for a period of
eightcmonths after her sister moved away
for college as a way for them to stay in con-
tact with one another.
The sisters posted videos on YouTube to
one another every day, with Chellie post-
ing on Monday, Wednesday and Friday,
while her sister would post on Tuesday
and Thursday. The next week they would
switch.
"My first videos were really awkward,"
, Carr said. "I was trying to mimic other
people and it didn't work very well. It's
really weird the first time you sit in a room

by yourself and talk to a computer screen."
After their first year apart, the Carr
sisters - also known as shortsisters756
on Youtube - stopped vlogging on a daily
basis, but still posted content.
On Aug. 8, 2008. the sisters filmed a
Nerdfighter convention they attended and
posted a video of the event. Their video
was featured on the Vlogbrothers' chan-
nel, which led to more than 11,000 views.
"It's strange, but also thrilling and
exciting," Carr said.
Now about 5,400 people subscribe to
Carr's channel - nearly enough followers
to stand in for an entire freshman class at
the University - but she said doesn't feel
like a celebrity at all.
Expanding the community
Last year, 21-year-old Dan Brown (user-
name pogobat) tested YouTube's capacity
to connect the virtual masses. With over
120,000 subscribers, he wanted to see how
far he could push the relationship.
"(YouTube) is a two-way thing, as
opposed to what other mediums have been
like before this," Brown said. "The rela-
tionship with the audience is inherently
more personal."
Brown is no newcomer to fame. In 2007,
at age 17, Brown posted an instructional
video that demonstrated how to solve a
Rubik's Cube. 1.5 million views later, he
was approached by YouTube and asked
if he would like to be a participate in the
Partnership Program.
That same year, YouTube flew him from
his home in Nebraska to New York where
they awarded him best instructional video
of the year.
A few years later, as a sophomore and
political science major at the University of
Nebraska, Brown was still posting wildly
successful videos.
"By the end of my freshman year, I real-
ized that it was really starting to go some-
where," Brown said. "I realized that the
time I was spending on school ... could be
(spent) on YouTube."
Knowing college would always be an
option later in life, Brown dropped out.
He posted videos on an almost daily
basis, covering everything from contro-
versial topics like abortion and global
warming, to the less serious issues of spi-
ders and McDonald's.
"I wanted to expose my ideas to a big,
diverse audience and see if they would
pick it apart and point out flaws," Brown
said. "I just wanted to vent."
Brown's videos also featured his per-
sonal life, including details about his
girlfriend Danielle deLeon and the story
of how they met online. That video has
almost 100,000 views.
DeLeon applied to manage a forum
Brown was collaborating on with the Vlog-
brothers. Brown thought she was cute, so
he e-mailed her and contacted her through
Facebook. After Skyping a few times,
Brown went to visit her for New Year's,
and they fell in love.

Brown's fans ate the video up. Though
the situation was incredibly personal,
Brown didn't mind.
"My philosophy with YouTube is that
it's an extension of myself," Brown said.
"What I'm doing on my personal YouTube
is what I personally want to do."
About a year ago, he decided to conduct
an experiment that gave his fans even
more access to his personal life than they
previously had.
At that point, Brown considered himself
to be an o-list celebrity (he used Angelina
Jolie as a reference point for an A-list fig-
ure), and wanted to use his large audience
to test how far the vlogging medium could
be stretched.
Brown came up with an idea for a vlog-
ging project called Dan 3.0, in which his
fans could not only tell him what he should
vlog about, but also control how he lived.
"In theory, Dan 3.0 was the ultimate
interaction with the audience," Brown
said. "When you tell the audience 'You
have control of my life,' they have expecta-
tions, and I bit off more than I could chew."
With nearly total control over Brown's
life, his viewers eventually told him to
move to San Francisco - so he did.
Dolsen, who is an avid Dan Brown fan,
remembered how Brown's move to San
"My fans still
interact with me
through a screen,
and on a certain
level, I'm stilijust a
character to them."
-Dan Brown, YouTube vlogger
Francisco impacted his life.
"It kind of failed because (Brown)
wasn't happy," Dolsen said. "His videos
became more about doing things than
talking about controversial issues like he
used to."
In one of his videos during the project,
called "D3PO So Far," Brown updated his
fans about his life in San Francisco, and
also told them that he broke up with deLe-
on.
"I want to make sure that it doesn't
seem like I'm just sweeping this under the
rug," Brown said in the video.
Even in the intense emotional situation
of a freshly ended relationship, Brown's
fans still knew what was going on and had
a relatively large window into his personal
life.
But despite his openness with his fans,
Brown admitted they didn't know every-
thing about his life, though some may have
felt otherwise.

Brown didn't anticipate the way some of
his fans started to treat him. After break-
ing up with deLeon, he received comments
from viewers who didn't agree with his
decision, siding with his ex.
"Some of the feedback I got about (the
breakup) I took very, very personally,"
Brown said. "Even though it was a per-
sonal relationship, my fans still interact
with me through a screen, and on a certain
level, I'm still just a character to them."
During his experience at Dan 3.0, Brown
didn't always maintain a positive relation-
ship with his fans, but according to him, it
was humbling and insightful.
After the Dan 3.0 stint, Brown's content
and views have been wildly inconsistent,
but he's not concerned. The YouTuber
still posts content while working full-time
in New York City, but his viewership has
dropped to 20,000 views per video.
"Everyone has their ups and downs," he
said. "But if I need to, I can do five videos a
week and still get 20,000 views and make
money."
Real people, real problems
For the last two years in Los Angeles, a
Nerdfighter convention known as VidCon
has brought Nerdfighters and their favor-
ite vloggers together for two days.
VidCon brings everything that happens
on YouTube to life.
Nerdfighters can meet online friends
for the first time in person, get autographs
from vloggers and meet new people who
love watching YouTube videos just as
much as they do.
The convention's atmosphere mostly
consists of fans fawning over online celeb-
rities, as they do at movie premieres.
But according to Oakley, some YouTu-
bers choose be alone in their hotel rooms
when they aren't giving speeches or at
scheduled events.
It's easy to forget these people became
famous by talking to a camera alone in
their room, Oakley said. They aren't neces-
sarily interested in being in a room full of
screaming fans - being a celebrity in reali-
ty is different than being a virtual one, and
some vloggers just can't do that.
And so fans might not be as connected
to their virtual idols as they think, since
comments and tweets can only go so far.
But for Nerdfighters, friendships made
online with other fans can be just as real
as other relationships.
And sometimes, it's not just about the
videos.
At a Nerdfighter event Carr went to, two
of her Nerdfighter acquaintances met and
had more in common than a few videos
they both liked. Last summer the couple
got married and spent their honeymoon at
- where else? - VidCon.
"We're juggling our personal lives and
our public lives at the same time," Brown
said. "Everyone has a public persona now,
and you just have to figure out how much
of that you want to reveal. We're all trying
to figure it out."

What are you reading right now?
I just finished a book by Harold Bloom. He is
marvelously learned, particularly on lyric poetry. The
book that he has done is "The Anatomy of Influence."
What about movies?
One that I found surprisingly close to my interests and
to my interpretation of the work, with which I deal
a good deal, was "The Merchant of Venice." There
was a recent film of it starring Jeremy Irons and
Ralph Fiennes, a surprisingly insightful film into the
complexities of that text.
Where's your ideal travel destination?
I've not been to China. I'd very much like that. I'd been
wanting to do Chinese as a language.

t s rea V
ube turns the personal
into public
By Lucy Perkins

L SA freshman David Dolsen's hobby
wasn't something he talked to friends
about - not at first.
"It's something you do on your own
time," Dolsen said. "It's not something I'm
ashamed of. I just didn't talk about it."
Dolsen is a Nerdfighter, on a quest to fight
world suck.
"Instead of being made of cells and body
stuff, Nerdfighters are made of awesome,"
Dolsen said.
Nerdfighters are part of an online com-
munity centered on a series of YouTube
vlogs - short for video blogs - posted by
brothers John and Hank Green, also known
as the Vlogbrothers.
Though many people see YouTube as a
virtual hub where they can find music vid-
eos and watch that one idiot majorly wipe
out on a skateboard ramp, the Nerdfighters
view YouTube as a community. Channels,
schedules and videos are full of inside jokes.
Comments come from familiar usernames.
The Vlogbrothers didn't initially see
their channel as something to be shared.
They merely vlogged as a way to keep in
touch with each other while they lived at
opposite ends of the country. Each day, one
brother would post a video on YouTube
for the other one, telling the other brother
about funny things that happened to him,
often challenging the other to do things
and report back.
Rather inexplicably, the Vlogbrothers
developed a following. First appearing on
YouTube in 2007, the community surround-
ing the Vlogbrothers now includes more
than 500,000 subscribers and upward of 187
million total upload views.
"YouTube is an incredibly powerful way
to connect people," said Will Luers, a visit-
ing professor in the Creative Media & Digital
Culture program at Washington State Uni-
versity. "People can convey ideas through a
personalized approach."
Since the Vlogbrothers' arrival to You-
Tube, other vloggers have joined the Nerd-
fighter community. Some of their videos are
about random things that happen to them
during the day, while others read "Twilight"
or talk about comments they receive from
their fans.
With a wide range of videos being posted,
Nerdfighters can view new content every
day by visiting the channels of the vloggers
they follow.

"It's television on a smaller scale," Luers
said. "But it can reach a wider audience,
because everyone is searching for content at
any point in time."
The work is virtual, but the
money is real
For the vloggers, becoming a part of this
online community has been something of a
financial success.
The YouTube Partnership Program,
launched in Dec. 2007, works with popular
vloggers to generate revenue in a way that
is beneficial to YouTube and the YouTuber.
According to its website, YouTube now has
more than 20,000 partners in 22 countries
around the world - some making six-figure
salaries just by creating and posting their
videos.
Tyler Oakley (username tyleroakley), a
Michigan State University alum and a vlog-
ger within the Nerdfighter community,
applied to the program in early 2008, and
was accepted as a partner.
After joining the Partnership Program,
Oakley obtained access to tutorials and tips,
courtesy of YouTube, that suggested how to
improve the quality of the videos he posted.
YouTube is keen on the adoption of these
suggestions by big-time YouTubers because
the more popularity and success people like
Oakley receive, the more successful You-
Tube is too.
Essentially, when a vlogger becomes a
partner, ads are featured on their video. The
more views the video gets, the more money
YouTube generates and the vlogger gets a
bigger cut of the revenue.
Oakley never expected to have a career as
a YouTuber, and for the most part, he still
sees it as a hobby. He has a full-time job in
social media. Though he said YouTube is a
great boost to his income, he does acknowl-
edge that it's difficult to just make a living
off the website.
"It's hard because at any time you can go
up and down in popularity so quickly," Oak-
ley said. "You can't control it."
Oakley said about 70 percent of his
120,000 subscribers are preteen girls, a per-
centage that sounds more like Taylor Laut-
ner's female fanbase from the "Twilight"
saga. His top viewed video, "HOW TO: Be A
Bad Bitch," in which he lip synes and dances
wildly in his computer chair to Nicki Minaj's
