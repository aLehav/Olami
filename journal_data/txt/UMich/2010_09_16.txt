Qwizdom to

Profs., students say
new prompt system
is more user-friendly
By VALIANT LOWITZ
Daily StaffReporter'
After a three-year stint as the
University's preferred Audience
Response System, the Qwiz-
dom remote has been replaced
by an updated clicker tool - the
i>clicker.
The new i>clicker system has
been in a pilot phase since 2008
with three faculty members and
four GSIs participating in the
program. Faculty response to the
i>clicker was overwhelmingly
positive, according to Lynne
Crandall, manager of Instruc-
tional Technology Consulting
at the University's Instructional
Support Services.
In an e-mail to interview,
Crandall wrote that of the 36 fac-
ulty members who used either
the i>clicker or the Qwizdom
during Fall 2009, Winter 2010
and Spring 2010, 26 expressed
an interest in moving to the
i>Clicker.
Among the remaining faculty
members, eight did not respond,
one reported no opinion and
another was unsure if any stu-
dent response system ought to be

used in the future.
"The i>clicker system is cer-
tainly more, robust, has a faster
learning curve on both the fac-
ulty and student side and is more
flexible," wrote Brenda Gunder-
son, a professor in the Depart-
ment of Statistics, in an e-mail
interview.
Instead of being forced to fol-
low a linear PowerPoint presen-
tation-style structure, as was the
case with the Quizdom remote,
professors can use the i>clicker
when discussing movie con-
tent, Internet content and other
images, while still using question
prompts - a feature, that accord-
ing to Crandall, "translates into
a richer learning experience for
students."
Physics Prof. Gus Evrard said
the i>clicker is also more user-
friendly than its predecessor.
"The interface for students
and faculty is infinitely better,"
Evrard said.
In the past, students using
Qwizdom were required to type
in their student identification
number and class code at the
beginning of lectures, Evrard
said. The i>clicker remote, how-
ever, requires students to register
only once online which creates
"less of a hassle to get going," he
added.
"For faculty, the i>clicker

Political insider:
* GOP will take state
House, Senate
By STEPHANIE BERLIANT
Daily StaffReporter
* Michigan political pundit Bill
Ballenger gave his predictions
for the state's upcoming mid-

term elections at a campus event
last night.
Speaking to a crowd of about
100 people at the Ford School
of Public Policy, Ballenger dis-
cussed each of the November
elections, including the race for
governor, State Senate, State
House and State Supreme Court.
He said the goal of the talk
wasn't to sway voters towards
either party, but to inform them

about which races he views as
important.
A former state senator, Bal-
lenger predicted a better year
for the Republicans than in
2006 and 2008, adding that he
expects Republicans will con-
tinue to control the state Senate
21-17. He added that he thought
Republicans will likely make
gains in the state House, though
the make up there will still

likely be 50 Republicans to 62
Democrats.
The race for governor is
"(Republican candidate) Rick
Snyder's to lose," Ballenger
said, adding that one out of
five people polled had no name
recognition of the Democratic
candidate, Lansing mayor Virg
Bernero, whose disapproval rat-
ing is higher than his approval.

Brenda Lawrence
talks education
funding on campus
By SARA BOBOLTZ
Daily StaffReporter
As the gubernatorial race heats
up in Michigan, the Democratic
nominee for lieutenant governor
and current mayor of Southfield,
Brenda Lawrence, visited campus
yesterday afternoon to talk about
the issues she and running mate
Virg Bernero face in the upcom-

ingelection.
A crowd of about 20 people -
comprised mostly of members of
the University' chapter of Col-
lege Democrats - gathered in a
conference room at the Michigan
Union for the discussion. Law-
rence began by walking around
the room and introducing herself
before taking a seat and start-
ing her talk on the "Main Street
Michigan" agenda touted by Ber-
nero, who is currently the mayor
of Lansing.
This is the first time two may-
ors have run for Governor and
Lieutenant Governor, but Law-

rence expressed her feeling that
their experience - Bernero has
held his position for five years,
and Lawrence for nine - will act
as an advantage.
"We are working, we are on
Main Street, we know what the
issues are because we live them
every day as mayors. We have to
fix them," she said.
She stressed the importance of
education "as an economic stimu-
lus," and especially the impor-
tance of funding the Michigan
Promise Scholarship. The schol-
arship was cut from the state's

By KYLE SWANSON
Daily News Editor
With a marimba playing, food
flowing and students, faculty and
staff mingling, University leaders
gathered yesterday to celebrate

the completion and opening of
North Quadrangle.
The housewarming, for the
University's newest residence hall
and academic center, included
speeches from key administra-
tors, student activities, tours and
a reception.
Speaking at the event, E. Roys-
ter Harper, the University's vice
president for academic affairs,
called the new facility a "vibrant
center for teaching, learning and
discovering."
Harper also shared her excite-

ment for the new facility, the first
new residence hall at the Univer-
sity in over four decades.
"It's been 43 years since we
last opened a new residence hall
and I imagine there was a great
deal of excitement among the first
residents of Bursley Hall," Harper
said to a light laughter in the audi-
ence.
"One of the things about a

NEWS BRIEFS
VIENNA
* Iran accused of
influencing nuclear
inspectors
A U.S. envoy accused Iran yes-
terday of intimidating U.N. nuclear
inspectors in an effort to influence
their findings - a move he said may
lead to "appropriate action," from
the International Atomic Energy
Agency.
Britain, France and Germany
also criticized Iran for its deci-
sion to ban several inspectors in
a toughly worded statement also
critical of Tehran for ignoring U.N.
Security Council demands to stop
nuclear activities that couldbe used
to make weapons.
"Iran is pursuing ... programs
which have no credible peace-
ful purposes," said the statement
to the IAEA's 35-nation board,
delivered by French chief delegate
" Florence Mangin. "The only con-
clusion we can draw from this is
that Iran remains determined to
pursue a nuclear program which
could provide it with military
capabilities."
In warning of "appropriate
action," Glyn Davies, the chief U.S.
delegate to the nuclear agency, did
not go into details in comments
to the board. But he referred to
the phrase as part of the author-
ity given the board if the agency's
inspectors are hampered in carry-
ing out their duties by the nation
under inspection.

Hundreds of residents in small

Mandatory evacuations involved
portions of the town of Bodfish and
an area known as Myers Canyon,
said Cindy Thill, a U.S. Forest Ser-
vice spokeswoman.
The fire erupted Sunday in the
Lower Kern River Canyon and

a portion of Sequoia National For-
est southwest of Lake Isabella, a
popular fishing, boating and hiking
:area about 110 miles north of down-

U.S.-led troop
movement part of
effort to reduce
violence in city
KANDAHAR, Afghanistan
(AP) - U.S. and Afghan forces
began advancing slowly yester-
day through the insurgent-filled
district in southern Afghani-
stan that gave birth to the Tal-
iban movement, treading ground
where guerrilla fighters have
operated freely for years, the
British general in charge of
NATO troops here said.
Maj. Gen. Nick Carter said the
latest push in Zhari district is
part of a crucial strategy aimed at
reducing violence in the provin-
cial capital Kandahar by stem-
ming the flow of fighters and
weapons there and connecting
civilians estranged from their
government.
But he downplayed the extent
of the latest troop movements
headed by the U.S. Army's 101st
Airborne Division, which mans
outposts with Afghan troops
throughout the district. He said
they were part of military opera-
tions that have been going on in
Zhari for at least four months. U.S.
and Afghan forces yesterday, he
said, had only gone "slightly fur-
ther than we've gone before."

The movements were signifi-
cant, though, because the loca-
tions were areas where coalition
forces had never been - at least
not in force.
One of the targets in Zhari was
the village of Makuan, which
U.S. commanders expect to clear
within days. Carter said troops
had "breached some IED belts"
adjacent to the village, referring to
bombs coalition forces often call
improvised explosive devices.
He said troops encountered
"some resistance," but gave no
details.
Also yesterday, the provincial
governor of Kandahar's spokes-
man, Zelmai Ayubi, said two chil-
dren aged 11 and 14 were killed
in a homemade bomb explosion.
Another child was wounded in
the blast in the Malajat areaon the
southwest edge of Kandahar city.
Meanwhile, NATO said 25
Afghan civilians had been killed
and 60 injured so far in Septem-
ber as the result of the Taliban
insurgency.
"While the Taliban talk of
protecting the people and issue
disingenuous directives claim-
ing to shield Afghans from harm,
instead they have increased
their use of indiscriminate vio-
lence, killing scores of innocent
Afghans," NATO spokesman
Rear Admiral Greg Smith said in
a statement. "Their rhetoric does
not match reality."

Elizabeth Warren
gained a reputation
as a staunch critic
of Wall Street
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi-
dent Barack Obama will appoint
Wall Street critic Elizabeth War-
ren as a special adviser to oversee
the creation of a new consumer
protection bureau, a Democratic
official said Wednesday.
Warren would report to both
the Treasury Department and the
White House in a role that would
not require Senate confirmation.
The 61-year-old Harvard Uni-
versity professor and consumer
advocate had been considered
the leading candidate to head
the bureau itself, but her lack of
support in the financial commu-
nity could have set the stage for
contentious Senate hearings that
might ultimately have derailed
her confirmation.
The official spoke on condition
of anonymity ahead of a formal
announcement.
White House officials would
not confirm the appointment, but
Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs
said an announcement could be
made this week.
While Obama has long been
a friend and supporter of War-
ren, he was keenly aware of the

potential pitfalls of nominating a
polarizing figure in the midst of a
heated election year.
"I am concerned about all
Senate nominations these days,"
Obama said during a news confer-
ence last week. "I've got people
who have been waiting for six
months to get confirmed who
nobody has an official objection to
and who were voted out of com-
mittee unanimously, and I can't
get a vote on them."
The consumer bureau was cre-
ated under the financial regula-
tory bill Obama signed into law
earlier this year. It will have vast
powers to enforce regulations
covering mortgages, credit cards
and other financial products,
and be financed by the Federal
Reserve.
The new bureau would consoli-
date consumer protection duties
now spread across various regula-
tory agencies.
The financial regulation law
gives the Treasury Department
the authority to run the consumer
protection bureau while the nom-
ination of its director is pending.
The law also says the Treasury
secretary must transfer those
functions to the new bureau
within a year, but gives him lati-
tude to seek an additional six
months to complete the creation
of the agency. That means Warren
could, potentially, perform her
new duties into 2012.

"I very much would like to see
her directing that agency. Exactly
in what form is less important.
to me that that she does it," Rep.
BarneyFrank, D-Mass., chairman
of the House Financial Services
Committee, told The Associated
Press on Wednesday. "If someone
told me that a candidate for that
job could be easily confirmed, I
think that would be a disqualifi-
cation."
The head of a liberal group that
has been campaigning for War-
ren to get the top consumer job
applauded the news, but added a
note of caution.
"If this appointment is window
dressing and (Treasury Secre-
tary) Tim Geithner controls the
show, it would be a big disap-
pointment and a victory for Wall
Street," said Stephanie Taylor,
co-founder of the Progressive
Change Campaign Committee.
Warren has served as head
of the Congressional Oversight
Panel, charged with monitoring
Treasury's handling of the $700
billion bank rescue fund known
as the Troubled Asset Relief Pro-
gram. She has at times clashed
with Treasury over her commit-
tee's findings and conclusions
about the use of TARP money.
As of Sept. 10, however, Warren
stepped back from working on the
group's latest report, a signal that
the new Treasury post was a pos-
sibility.

WASHINGTON (AP) - The

In the meantime, the head of

ty Board said the federal agency
responsible for the regulation is
too accepting of assurances from
industry that its equipment and
practices are safe.
Hersman's comments echoed
what safety advocates have long
called for - a pipeline agency that
needs to be less cozy with industry
and staffed with more inspectors
to enforce stricter regulations.
They welcomed the Obama
plan, but said it fell far short of
addressing the problems facing
the nation's millions of miles of
pipeline.
"It's the low-hanging fruit,"
said Rick Kessler with The Pipe-
line Safety Trust, a Bellingham,
Wash., advocacy group. "There's
no increase in mileage of pipelines
that must be inspected, there's
no standards for technology for
inspections or repairing pipe-

lines."
"If this is a starting point, fine.
If this is all the administrationhas
to say, it is wholly inadequate," he
said.
The U.S. Pipeline and Hazard-
ous Material Safety Administra-
tion is directly responsible for
inspecting interstate pipelines,
and has only 100 inspectors to do
it. Oversight of intrastate lines is
left to local regulators, who have
in most cases left the inspections
to utilities.
Hersman said the NTSB, which
is investigating the California
blast and two other pipeline acci-
dents, is concerned that PHMSA
relies too heavily on documents
submitted by the companies it
regulates, rather than its own on
site verification of practices and
procedures.
"We want PHMSA to be on the
ground doing the inspections,"
Hersman said. "We think it's
PHMSA's responsibility to trust
butverify."
Federal investigators said
they were examining whether
Pacific Gas & Electric workers
followed proper emergency pro-
cedures after a gas transmission
line exploded into an inferno that
killed at least four people and
destroyed nearly 40 homes in a
San Francisco suburb.
PG&E has said the pipeline,
built in 1956, had to be shut down
manually because it was not
equipped with automatic shut-off
valves.

CHICAGO (AP) - Several hun-
dred officers rallied outside Chica-
go police headquarters yesterday
and called for the city's top police
official to step down, saying initia-
tives he pushed through after join-
ing the force three years ago have
put their lives in danger and the
community at risk.
The police unions and many
among the force's rank-and-file
have been suspicious of Superin-
tendent Jody Weis since he was
asked by Mayor Richard Daley in
2007 to leave the FBI to lead the
police force in the nation's third
largest city.
In a show of force yesterday,
more than 300 officers marched
in the city's South Side neighbor-
hood, with many carrying signs
with slogans such as "More Police,
No Weis," and, simply, "Resign."
Several on-duty officers drove by
waving and holding up their fists
in support.
Jim Pasco, the executive direc-
tor of the National Fraternal Order
of Police, had called the protest
"extraordinarily unusual," and
many of those who marched yes-
terday said they'd never heard
of such an event. A similar rally
was held in 2004 in New York,
when hundreds of delegates of the
Patrolmen's Benevolent Associa-
tion gave Commissioner Raymond
Kelly a vote of no confidence after
he announced that an officer-
involved shooting appeared unjus-
tified only hours after it happened.
The protest against Weis comes
as the city and its leaders try to
make sense of Daley's announce-
ment last week that he would not
seek re-election in February after
more than 21 years in office. Weis'

three-year contract ends early
next year and without Daley there
to support him, some announced
and presumed candidates have
made the superintendent post a big
part of their campaigns.
"Remember, cops vote," one of
the marchers told Alderman Bob
Fioretti, who is widely expected
to officially announce he's running
for mayor, as he stood nearby.
Fioretti and others obviously
understand that, with Fioretti
telling anyone with a notebook or
microphone that the city has to
find the moneyto replace the 1,000
officers the department is down, as
well as say that whoever the next
mayor is, himself included, will not
extend Weis' contract.
"Morale is so low, it's time to
begin the process to look for a new
superintendent," he said.
Weis declined to comment on

yesterday's protest, but he said
recently he's not stepping down.
"I've still got more work ... and
I'm certainly not going to leave
until I get that work done," he told
reporters Tuesday.
Weis has taken his case to the
city and the department by send-
ing a letter to a local newspa-
per and posting another on the
department's website in which
he suggests, among other things,
that he's not going to be swayed
by marching officers outside his
office.
"Leadership is not about being
popular: it is about making dif-
ficult decisions and doing the
right thing," he wrote in the web
posting. Still, he added, "I have
led this department in a manner
which - on many issues - reflects
what the (FOP) membership has
asked for."

Undisguised bigotry
Cox should dismiss assistant attorney general
ften, it's best to turn the other cheek in the face of hate-
ful ignorance. But when hate speech is extreme and
public, it must be confronted. Andrew Shirvell, a Uni-
versity alum and a current assistant attorney general for the state
of Michigan, has taken aim at the Michigan Student Assembly
President Chris Armstrong almost exclusively because Arm-
strong is MSA's first openly gay president. Shirvell's undisguised
hatred for members of the LGBT community has compromised
his ability to serve as a public official. Michigan Attorney Gener-
al Mike Cox shouldn't be comfortable employing someone who's
bigotry so clearly has the potential to influence the work he does
on behalf of Michigan taxpayers. Cox must take decisive action
to respond to Shirvell's hate speech - and his pro forma slap on
the wrist this week isn't going to cut it.

Mr. Green goes to Washington.

Jnterns in Washington, D.C. tend
to have certain attributes in com-
mon. Unseasoned yet confident,
these individuals
are career-driven,
politically con-
scious and general-
ly affluent enough
to afford to live in
D.C. without get-
ting paid. They're
a pretty w61-edu-
cated crowd, and
they're often well MATTHEW
connected, too.
With all that going GREEN
for them, it's no_
wonder why many
of them think
they've got their lives figured out.
They think that this step leads to that
step which leads to this law school
and that job and this whole, wonder-
ful planned-out life.
Barely a week into my internship
this summer, I started to get nervous
that I hadn't completely sketched out
my life post graduation. Even though
I still have two years left in Ann
Arbor, I would lay awake in bed some
nights considering a host of ques-
tions about the next stages of my life.
Should I really study abroad? Take
another internship or two? Washing-
ton? New York? Law school?
I'll admit I'm rather anxiety-prone
in general. I could've spent the sum-
mer studying Buddhist meditation in
Nepal and I still probably would've
had panic attacks. But from talking
to some of the friends I made while
I was in D.C., it became clear I wasn't
the only one who was getting nervous
about mapping out my future.
I decided I'd start looking for guid-
ance from people who had insight into
more than merely which LSAT class

to take. I asked the advice of every-
one it was socially acceptable to ask.
Fortunately, in addition to the myriad
ambitious twenty-somethings there,
D.C. is also home to scads of profes-
sionals eager to give opinions and tell
their stories.
First, I spoke with congressional
staffers, young lawyers and non-prof-
it types. They were my first glimpse
into what a political career is really
like. Their stories varied, but a com-
mon thread was that none of them
went immediately to law school after
college - and about half never stud-
ied law. This was surely a departure
from what my friends and acquain-
tances were planning on doing.
As the summer progressed, I got to
meet an eclectic bunch of Washing-
ton insiders - a television producer,
a CEO, a journalist and a couple lob-
byists, among others. They had vastly
different success stories, but they all
had similar things to say. For starters,
they each suggested that I ignore the
nonsense spewing from the interns
around me. That might've been the
best advice of all. Yet more than that,
they all reassured me that a career
need not follow a linear path. Each of
these people had seemingly unrelated
professional experiences that didn't fit
neatly together, but all of them were
quite successful. Once I realized this,
an unfamiliar calm came over me.
Then, on one of my last days in
Washington, I went to a Middle East
policy seminar in one of the congres-
sional office buildings. I got there
early, and when I noticed a table
with coffee and pastries, I couldn't
resist. As I spread a modest portion of
cream cheese on a bagel, a man asked
me where I found the schmeer with
chives. I didn't recognize him at first,
but I quickly realized - admittedly

from his nametag - that he was a
congressman. After I pointed to a tub
of Philadelphia, the man made small
talk with me and eventually asked ifS
wanted to pursue a career in politics.
I said yes, but that I didn't know the
path I ought to take to get there. I was
pretty awkward at this point and I'm
not quite sure why he didn't leave me
to play with his Blackberry.
Unconventional
career advice from
D.C. insiders.
ButI was glad to hear the congress-
man's advice. He said I ought to use my
twenties to grow as a person before
really worrying about my career. I
mentioned my study abroad anxiety 0
and he told me to go for it. His advice
was not to be concerned about what
classes or experiences will be profes-
sionally "useful," but which will make
me a balanced human being. In other
words, he told me to do everything
conventional wisdom said not to. And
he did so in a tone perhaps more befit- 0
ting a maharishi than a politician.
In spite of so many invaluable and
quirky experiences this summer, I
don't know if I'll end up in politics.
But I figure the lessons I learned all
boil down to wisdom that could be
relevant to any career path. Experi-
ence as much as possible, don't get
nervous and don't decide upon a
career prematurely.

Shortly after the MSA election in March,
Shirvell launched a campaign against
Armstrong. Shirvell started his blog,
"Chris Armstrong Watch," in late April.
The blog has railed against what Shirvell
calls Armstrong's "radical homosexual
agenda," as he put it in his initial Aug. 29
post. The first blog post also contained a
photo of Armstrong with "Resign" writ-
ten over his face and a rainbow flag with
a swastika in the middle of it next to him.
Subsequent posts have labeled Armstrong
a liar, an elitist, a racist, a pervert and a
"viciously militant homosexual activist."
Over time, the attacks have expanded to
include several MSA members who work
closely with Armstrong. Recently, Shirvell
has taken to showing up at events at which
Armstrong is present.
Though much of Shirvell's tirades are
one step from utter nonsense, his dis-
dain for the LGBT community is obvious.
Shirvell criticizes the LGBT community's
push for social equality in blanket state-
ments that are plainly offensive to every-
one. Though offensive, however, Shirvell's
hateful remarks aren't a threat to campus.
The University community recognizes
Shirvell's attacks as what they really are:
the rants of a bigot.
Attorney General Mike Cox has not
reacted appropriately to this reality. As
reported on Tuesday, the attorney general's

office confirmed to the Daily that the office
was aware of Shirvell's blog. Yesterday, the
Detroit Free Press reported that Cox had
"chastised" Shirvell for the statements
made on the blog. According to a statement
from Cox, Shirvell is entitled to "a right to
free speech outside working hours ... But
Mr. Shirvell's immaturity and lack of judg-
ment outside the office are clear."
Shirvell's increasingly extreme actions
of discrimination aren't the result of a lapse
in judgment. His behavior does not stem
from immaturity. It stems from hatred.
And this type of hatred makes Shirvell
unsuitable to remain a government offi-
cial. It will affect his ability to objectively
interpret laws - which is the job of the
attorney general's office. It's unacceptable
that Cox hasn't dismissed a member of his
staff who is so blatantly bigoted. A finger-
wagging won't change the fact that Cox
has a responsibility to employ a thoughtful
staff that will fairly carry out their jobs on
behalf of the citizens of this state. Shirvell
doesn't fit this mold.
Cox shouldn't tolerate such offensive
behavior from someone who is required
to fairly defend the law. A scolding isn't an
acceptable response to the hatred that con-
tinues to be published on Shirvell's blog.
Cox must take serious action. He should
remove Shirvell from his position in the
attorney general's office.

ROGER SAUERHAFT
The net should remain neutral

I'm one of those people who considers a
school's ranking to be very important - a view
contrary to that of many other students. Maybe
it's because I like to know that my school is
among the top performers in the country or
because I want to reassure myself that I am get-
ting the best education possible. Whatever my
personal underlying reasons, a school's rank-
ing is important. Yet many students neglect to
consider rankings as one of the school's biggest
assets when making college decisions.
First, let's talk about where the Univer-
sity stands. In this year's rankings released
by Kaplan and Newsweek, the University was
featured as number 11 among the top 25 most
desirable large schools (having10,000 students
or more). Among the higher-ranking schools
were New York University and Harvard. The
University of Michigan also came in fifteenth
on a list of 25 top schools for future power bro-
kers, beating out Notre Dame. It's great that
the University is pulling in high rankings, but
how do students connect with these?
As a freshman,)I can still clearly remember
long months of college searches, applications
and decisions. My brother is currently a senior
here, so the University was already on my list
of schools to apply to. But how did I decide to
apply to other schools? Because I intended to
become a business major, my goal was to end
up here at the Ross School of Business. But I
needed a back-up plan just in case that didn't
happen, so I went to a list of rankings. Finding
that Indiana University was right behind the
University of Michigan, I chose to apply there.
Since the two business schools were neck and
neck at the time, I had a tough decision of
where to go. And I based my whole decision on
these rankings.
Thankfully, I ended up here, at a fabulous
school that has consistently been among the
most prestigious universities in the country.
The academics here are excellent, especially
for a public university. Our school's name
has been thrown around with the likes of Ivy
League colleges.
And what can the University of Michigan

name do for us? Land a job, of course. When
I saw the rankings in an article on Sept. 13, I
also spotted an item at AnnArbor.com with
the headline "Job recruiters find University
of Michigan grads more valuable than Ivy-
leaguers." I was shocked. I skimmed the article
to find that our University was ranked num-
ber 6 by the Wall Street Journal on a list of
schools that produce the best graduates over-
all. Schools like Harvard, Stanford and Princ-
eton, for example, were nowhere on the list.
The University seems to produce some heavy-
hitters, at least according to The Wall Street
Journal.
As a preferred-admission student to the
business school, I'm partial to Ross. I love the
building, the people and the academic pro-
gram. As a side note, The Wall Street Jour-
nal's survey also found that, to recruiters, the
University ranks first for business grads, first
for finance, sixth for accounting and seventh
for marketing and advertising. People clearly
know what we're all about. When I'm apply-
ing for internships and jobs, it's reassuring to
know that prospective employees will recog-
nize the prestige thatgoes along with the name
of my school.
So how important should these rankings
be? For me, it's all about landing a fantastic
job. The problem with many recruiters is that
they don't know much about the school itself.
So they look at our rankings. And when poten-
tial employers to go off rankings, which many
probably do, they will see before we even enter
an interview situation that any student from
our University will be well prepared to enter
the workforce and succeed.
Rankings are like a first impression. They're
the first things people will see about a school.
Along with a high ranking comes high prestige,
and I would hope that as students continue to
make decisions about their college choices,
they factor in where the school ranks. Even
though a ranking shouldn't matter enough to
define an individual, it does.

Google has long reveled in its position as the Internet
firm that could do no wrong by consumers. The 12-year-
old company, which has strong ties to Ann Arbor, has long
distanced itself from its competition not only through
famously complex algorithms - which maximize web-
browsing efficiency - but also by repeatedly safeguard-
ing the free flow of information on the Web.
The uncluttered, clean appearance of Google is one
of the many aspects that make it so universally loved.
Google's recent headline-grabbing squabbles with China
over censorship appealed to the masses for altruistic rea-
sons. This was one of the world's most powerful brands
foregoing profits in favor of taking a stand against the
oppressive Chinese government. In April, Google even
published statistics showing the number of requests
made by national governments for removal of data from
the Internet.
Given these actions, it's no surprise to hear that Google
was once among the staunchest of the Obama adminis-
tration's allies for net-neutrality. According to Bloomberg
BusinessWeek, net-neutrality means all information on
the Web is shared free and equally.
"Allowing broadband companies to control what peo-
ple see and do online would fundamentally undermine
the principles that have made the internet such a suc-
cess," Google employee and Web pioneer Vincent Cerf
told Congress, according to The Economist, prior to the
April ruling by a federal court that the Federal Communi-
cations Commission - the FCC - had no right to regulate
Internet service providers.
Everything changed on Aug. 9, when Google complete-
ly reversed course and abandoned net-neutrality, much to
the chagrin of the administration and the FCC - as well
as advocates for the freedom of information. Google CEO
Eric Schmidt teamed with Verizon to suggest a plan for a
tiered pricing system on the Web, essentially partitioning
the Internet into fast and slow lanes depending on what
each user is doing.
Congress has yet to reach a consensus on the issue,
but if this plan comes to fruition, service providers will
be able to decide what content will flow quickly and what
will flow more slowly. Making the concept of net-neutral-
ity a relic of the past.
"Google has taken a big step back in people's eyes," ana-
lyst Craig Moffett of the financial research firm Sanford
C. Bernstein told Bloomberg on Aug. 12. "The company
that's supposed to not be evil is suddenly being character-
ized by the net neutrality crowd as the arch-villain."
Schmidt supports the plan by saying the market has
created the demand for a tiered system and that efficiency
will lead to better results for everyone. Advocates point

to the usual free-market talking points, like the idea that
government involvement with the Web will lessen pri-
vate investment and derail innovation. However, it was
the government's innovation that created the Web itself
through the Department of Defense.
The Economist recently posed the question of wheth-
er or not companies such as Amazon, Facebook and yes,
even Google, could have become what they are today
under such a plan? Would open source systems - essen-
tially allowing anyone to create anything - be able to
thrive under a Web that is no longer open?
The future of the openness of the Internet has never been
so bleak. The book is currently being written and net-neu-
trality advocates appear headed for tough times given the
stunning shift by the company that has been named as the
world's most powerfulbrand four years running.
The potential for abuse of power by the service provid-
ers seems limitless. Advocates of Google and Verizon's
plan may point to the open market as a positive, but an
open market is characterized by competition. The market
being entirely dominated by AT&T, Verizon and Comcast
is hardly a beacon of open competition. Furthermore,
given Comcast's pending acquisition of NBC Universal,
a major provider of content, the stage is set perfectly for
such abuse. These are all firms, and their primary goal is
profit not altruism. Just read the wistful words of former
Fed Chairman and free-market icon Alan Greenspan as
the economy spun out of control in 2008:
"I made a mistake in presuming that the self-interests
of organisations, specifically banks and others, were such
that they were best capable of protecting their own share-
holders and their equity in the firms," said Greenspan as
quoted by The Guardian in Oct. 2008.
Abandoning the concept of net-neutrality is a mistake for
many reasons, not merely basic principles. Google is among
the most powerful, trusted companies in the world. This
180-degree shift is disturbing and likely to actually mean
something, as the laws that govern the Web are essentially
being written as we speak. President Barack Obama made a
career as an academic and he certainly represents the inter-
ests of the University and everyone involved in academia
with his support of net-neutrality.
Google has close ties to Ann Arbor and the University.
Its co-founder attended college here and many Univer-
sity graduates find work at Google, which has an office in
Ann Arbor. The University trains the leaders and the best,
often for jobs at Google, so it's about time we stepped u
and made a difference while the book is still being writ-
ten.

BALLENGER
From Page 1A
As editor and publisher of the
political newsletter Inside Michi-
gan Politics, Ballenger said his is
the only newsletter in the country
to make political predictions - and
that 88 percent of its predictions
for this year's Michigan primaries
were accurate.
In addition to his predictions,
Ballenger also emphasized the
importance of the Supreme Court
judges' race.
Historically, in census years,
Supreme Court justices are cru-
cial in determining the reappor-
tionment of state representatives
across agiven state, Ballenger said.
He added that usually one-third
of voters don't vote for a Supreme
Court candidate in the election
because they don't know the can-
didates.
Additionally, all 15 members of
Congress from Michigan are on
the ballot, though Ballenger said
he believes this will be the last year
Michigan will have that many rep-
resentatives.
The number has dropped from
19 in 1982 and will likely contin-
ue to decrease due to Michigan's
shrinking population, he said. The
eighth-largest state by population
currently, Ballenger said Michigan
is at risk of losing two representa-
tives by 2020.

"All state employees have a right
to free speech outside working
hours," Cox said ina statementyes-
terday, according to the Free Press.
"But Mr. Shirvell's immaturity and
lack of judgment outside the office
are clear."
A spokesman for Cox, John
Sellek confirmed to the Free Press
yesterday that Shirvell is a civil ser-
vice employee in Cox's office, but
wouldn't comment further on the
matter. Cox officials also confirmed
to The Michigan Daily last week
that Shirvell works in Cox's office.

building or the home so different,

here," she added.
University Provost Philip Han-
lon also spoke at the event, saying
North Quad offered the University
community an entirely new type of
facility to grow in.
"Say what you will about the
North Quad, one thing you have to
admit is it's really different," Han-
lon said. "It's unlike anything this
University has ever tried before."
At the center of the innovative
University building, Hanlon said, is
the strong connection between liv-
ing and learning.
"Imagine in this one magnificent
facility, we're housing an upper-
class residence hall, three of our
best academic units, two of our
busiest academic support units,
this swanky dining hall,. as well
as advanced media and technol-
ogy in the classrooms and com-
mon spaces," Hanlon said, looking
out over the crowd gathered at the

event. "Those are the pieces we've
thrown together in North Quad and
the glue is the global engagement
theme."
University President Mary Sue
Coleman was also on hand at the
event, echoing Hanlon's com-
ments and challenging residents to
embrace the unique opportunities
and resources offered by the North
Quad facility.
"This afternoon's housewarming
is really for the residents and faculty
and staff, the students who are living
and learning in the North Quad, but
it's an exciting day for all of us at the

Michigan political pundit and editor of "Inside Michigan Politics" Bill Ballenger speaks at the Ford School of Public Policy yesterday.

Ballenger also discussed the
election for the University's Board
of Regents. Two regents are up for
reelection this election cycle. Bal-
lenger noted that Michigan is the
only state to elect higher education
regents through a state-wide elec-
tion.
In recent years, Democrats have
held a 6-2 majority on the Univer-
sity's Board of Regents. This year,
the board's two Republican mem-
bers are up for reelection.

In an e-mail interview with
The Daily last month, Shirvell
said he decided to start speaking

"Armstrong's agenda is immor-
al, in my opinion," Shirvell wrote
in the e-mail interview.
One post on the blog includes a
photo of Armstrong with a rain-
bow flag, a swasticka and the word
"resign" drawn in. The post also
criticizes Armstrong's push for
gender-neutral housing as a ploy
to force heterosexual students of
different genders to room togeth-

In an interview after the event,

At last week's MSA meeting,
Shirvell accused Armstrong of
lying to students about his inten-

"Even the first gay MSA presi-

Shirvell said at last week's MSA

The society, once known as
Michigauma, has been criticized
by some for allegedly using Native
American rituals and artifacts in
its meetings in the past. In an effort
to distance itself from its contro-

name in 2007 and began publishing

it affects all of our lives."
Ruth Brown, a Public Policy

found the event informative.

Armstrong declined to comment

"I have always been open and

role as MSA president," Armstrong
wrote in an e-mail to the Daily last

University," she said. "The promise
and potential is limitless."
Following Coleman's remarks,
several University officials gath-
ered on stage to tie a string of flags
together, a gesture to the global liv-
ing and learning emphasis that will
be the hallmark of North Quad.
And while most of those in atten-
dance were faculty and staff, sev-
eral students were on hand to take
part in the festivities.
LSA senior Tanya Zora, a part
of the residence hall staff at North
Quad, also spoke at the event. Zora
said that in her experience, having
lived in Alice Lloyd, West Quad,
East Quad, and Baits residence
halls, North Quad offered the best
experience.

"I feel like out of all the residence
halls I've lived in, North Quad has
really encapsulated what I want
out of my experience at Michigan,"
Zora said.
But Zora wasn't the only student
at the event who gave the new facil-
ity high marks.
LSA junior Ramya Purushotha-
man, who lives in North Quad and
attended yesterday's event, said she
enjoys living in the new residence
hall.
"I like it so far," Purushothaman
said. "The rooms are nice, the peo-
ple are nice, the cafeteria is alright."
However, Purushothaman, who
previously lived in West Quad, said
she's still adjusting to her new home.
"In some ways (it's) better, but I

still need to get used to it," she said,
comparing her experience in North
Quad to that in West Quad. "I guess
I expected it tobe a little different,
but overall it's a good experience."
Engineering senior Ashley Pol-
lock, who has lived inStockwell and
Mary Markley residence halls, said
she enjoys the atmosphere of North
Quad.
"I think it feels more like a com-
munity," Pollock said, explaining
the smaller dining hall and Global
Scholars Program provide students
with a more intimate setting.
She added: "There's obviously a
lot of technology around that you
wouldn't really see in Stockwell or
Markley, like Wi-Fi and air condi-
tioning."

Slaying of Afghan nationals by former
Blackwater employees fueled by alcohol

Two former defense
contractors face
murder charges for
killing two people
NORFOLK, Va. (AP) - Two
former defense contractors were
fueled by alcohol and rage the night
they killed two Afghan nationals
and injured another on the streets
of Kabul, prosecutors claimed dur-
ing opening statements of the their
trial yesterday..
Their attorneys countered that
Justin H. Cannon, 28, and Chris-
topher Drotleff, 30, believed they
were under attack on a dark, dan-
gerous highway when they opened
fire the night of May 5,2009.
Cannon, of Corpus Christi,
Texas, and Drotleff, of Virginia

Beach,' face murder, assault and
weapons charges that could send
them to prison for life. Their trial
began Wednesday in U.S. District
Court and is expected to last two to
three weeks.
The men were in Afghanistan
to provide weapons training to the
Afghan National Army as contrac-
tors with Paravant, a subsidiary
of Blackwater Worldwide. North
Carolina-based Blackwater, now
known as Xe Services, has settled
numerous federal lawsuits alleging
that illegal activity by the company
led to the deaths of dozens of Iraqis.
Prosecutors said the pair were
"a disaster waiting to happen" that
day, drinking for several hours
after two of their superiors were
fired before disobeying a direct
order and heading out to drive two
Afghan interpreters and another
man to a taxi stand. They were on

a road known for attacks on Ameri-
cans.
"They were drinking. They were
driving. They were armed and they
were out of control," said Robert
McGovern, a Department of Jus-
tice attorney.
Both sides agree that the men
left their camp to drive two Afghan
interpreters and another man to
a taxi stand late that night, that
the second SUV in their convoy
wrecked, and that the men shot at
a small, gray Toyota that sped from
the crash scene.
Prosecutors said the SUV
wrecked because it was driving too
faston theunlitfour-lane road, that
the driver swerved to miss a vehicle
and turned onto its side. Defense
attorneys said Cannon and Drotleff
believed that a car that had gotten
between them and the lead SUV
bumped it, causing it to wreck on

purpose.
When a similar car approached
the wreck site driving on the
wrongside of the road, Cannon and
Drotleff believed they were under
attack, the men's attorneys said.
"Will the evidence show that
they got out of their car in a drunk
homicidal rage and shot the first
Afghani they saw? No," said Drot-
leff's attorney, Lawrence Wood-
ward.
"There's not going to be any evi-
dence that Mr. Drotleff acted on
anything but fear, legitimate fear,"
he said.
Prosecutors claim instead that
the victims were headed to their
village after a day working in their
flower wholesale business followed
by dinner, and that they were driv-
ing on the shoulder of the road
simply as a shortcut - a common
occurrence along that road.

Obama urges
Hispanics to
vote for Dems'
in midterms


LAWRENCE
From Page 1A
budget for the 2010 fiscal year, but
Democratic Gov. Jennifer Gran-
holm revived it in her budget pro-
posal for 2011, this time as a tax
credit that would be awarded to
graduates of state universities who
choose to work in Michigan for a
year after graduating.
"A mentor of mine said that in
corporate America and in leader-
ship, you follow the money a per-
son spends and you'll find their
priorities. And so education will
be a priority of ours," Lawrence
stated.
Several students in attendance
also brought up the Promise
Scholarship, saying it's an issue
that needs to be addressed by the
new administration.
LSA junior Nina Bhattacharya
said there is a subset of families
that do not make enough money to
pay for college tuition but do make
enough to be disqualified for fed-
eral financial aid.
"The Michigan Promise Schol-
arship was something that was

achievable for us," she said.
On the topic of education, Law-
rence also spoke about measures
to cut high school dropout rates in
order to lower incarceration rates
in Michigan, which she said were
some of the highest in the coun-
try. One way to accomplish that,
she said, is to hold parents more
accountable for their children's
education.
"I think parents should get a
report card as well as children. Do
you attend PTAs? Are you involved
in the school? And I know there
are all kinds of challenges - work-
ing parents, single heads of house-
holds - but there's always a way to
work that out," she said.
Lawrence gave private schools
as an example, explaining that
many successful private schools
require parents to attend a certain
number of activities at the school
per year.
Lawrence called attention to
the differences between herself
and Bernero and their opponent,
Republican nominee Rick Snyder.
She commented on Snyder's
refusal to hold a debate with
Bernero, calling it an "absolute

insult" to voters. She criticized
his commitment to the state and
his business decisions as the for-
mer CEO of Gateway, saying that
Snyder, an "elitist who has lived
a life of extreme wealth," elimi-
nated jobs and outsourced others
overseas.
Lawrence also discussed the
"brain drain" and stressed the
importance of small businesses
and startups as catalysts for an
economic turnaround and called
on college graduates to help.
"We're going to have to start
creating jobs," she said. "Under-
stand that amazing talent and
ability that you may have is an
opportunity for you to make a
job for yourself and those around
you."
Lawrence, who is from Detroit,
spoke briefly about her native
city, saying many of the problems
there were a result of bureaucratic
red tape. A more "connected and
responsive" government could
help eliminate these problems,
paving the way for developers
and potential business owners to
invest in the city.
Detroit would also bene-

fit, she said, by more stringent
code enforcement for aesthetic
improvement.
The city "once had beautiful
communities that are now just
totally blight," she said. "But it
starts one house at a time. I'm pas-
sionate about that."
She also noted a lack of mass
transit systems - like bus or train
systems - in cities throughout
Michigan, and suggested that
developing them would be a great
benefit. Every major successful
city, she said, has mass transit
options for residents, which some-
times helps them find and reach
their jobs.
Brendan Campbell, an LSA
junior and president of College
Democrats, said he enjoyed Law-
rence's talk and is excited for what
she has planned for the state.
"It's really inspiring to see
someone who's willing to invest
in the state of Michigan, someone
who's been running a city suc-
cessfully for the past nine years,
and someone who has the expe-
rience to lead Michigan in the
direction we want to see it go,"
Campbell said.

Obama on
immigration: 'You
have every right to
keep the heat on me'
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi-
dent Barack Obama appealed
to Hispanics yesterday to sup-
port Democrats in the Novem-
ber elections despite his failed
promise to pass an immigration
overhaul.
"Don't forget who is stand-
ing with you," the president said
as he blamed Republicans for
standing in the way of progress.
Less than two month before
midterm elections that could
prove disastrous for Demo-
crats who run Congress, Obama
acknowledged the disappoint-
ment among Latinos over the
immigration issue and pledged
to keep pushing for a compre-
hensive overhaul of the nation's
immigration laws to deal with
border security and provide an
eventual route to legal status
for the estimated 11 million ille-
gal immigrants in the United.
States.
"You have every right to keep
the heat on me and the Demo-
crats, and I hope you do. That's
how our political process works,"
Obama said the Congressio-
nal Hispanic Caucus Institute's
awards dinner. "But don't forget
who is standing with you, and
who is standing against you.
Don't ever believe that this elec-
tion coming up doesn't matter."
Obama also promised to help
win passage of a bill, known as

the DREAM Act, that would
allow young people who attend
college or join the military to
become legal U.S. residents.
Senate Majority Leader Harry
Reid, D-Nev., said this week that
he wants to attach the measure
to an upcoming defense policy
bill that the Senate could begin
considering as soon as next week.
Obama cast Republicans as
the bad guys in the tussle over
immigration, saying some GOP
senators who in the past had
supported a comprehensive
approach now oppose moving
forward just to thwart his agen-
da.
"Now I know that many of you
campaigned hard for me, and
understandably you're frustrat-
ed that we have not been able to
move this over the finish line yet.
I am too," he said. "But let me be
clear: I will not walk away from
this fight. My commitment is to
getting this done as soon as we
can."
Some in the audience shouted
"when?"
Obama urged Hispanics to
remember who extended health
care to millions of children, pro-
vided Pell Grants for Latino stu-
dents and enacted credit card
reform and created a new agency
to protect consumers from pred-
atory lending, including millions
of immigrants who send money
to relatives in their native coun-
tries.
"Don't forget who your friends
are," he said. "No se olviden" -
Spanish for "Don't forget."
Obama was revisiting the
immigration issue again on
Thursday.

Blue continues late-game heroics
in close victory over Oakland

'M' finds groove at home

Freshman Saad
keeps up hot streak
on offense with goal
By STEPHEN NESBITT
Daily Sports Writer
In the closing minutes of a con-
test against Oakland on Wednes-
day night,
in a game OAKLAND 1
domi- MICHIGAN 2
nated by
lackluster offense and sloppy play,
the offense of the Michigan men's
soccer team finally found its legs.
Senior forward Justin Meram
ended the evening in dramatic
fashion, burying a shot past a
sprawling goalkeeper with only
a minute remaining on the clock,
giving the Wolverines a 2-1 vic-
tory.
Deadlocked at zero after 70
minutes, Michigan (3-1-1) looked
to its main weapons on the attack
- Meram and freshman forward
Soony Saad.
Saad continued his hot streak on
offense by netting a header at 74:35
to grab a 1-0 lead, giving the fresh-
man his team-high fourth goal of
the season.
The first-year phenom was
quick to credit teamwork on the
play, as well as the assist from
senior midfielder Alex Wood.
"No one (on defense) knew
where I was," Saad said. "I was
kind of trying to hide behind the
last defender. Woody played a
driven ball back and I wanted to
head it down. We did a lot of drills
in practice about heading it down,
and when I headed it down it kind
of kept the keeper surprised and
went over the keeper."
But the Golden Grizzlies booted
the equalizer just four minutes
later, as a defensive breakdown left
Jeff Timm open in front of the net
to meet a crossing pass - and he.
didn't miss his opportunity.
Thirsty for his elusive first goal
of the season, Meram turned his

By STEVEN KELLNER
For the Daily
Following a daunting road trip
that saw the Michigan field hockey
team post only two goals in four
games, the excitement as the Wol-
verines stepped onto Ocker Field
for the first time this season to take
on the James Madison Dukes was
tangible.
It had been a rough start to the
season for the Wolverines, playing
three of the top six ranked teams in
a span of nine days, all on the road.
With high expectations and
senior leadership, Michigan hoped
to compete for a Big Ten Champi-
onship this season, but the team
encountered an obstacle when it
lost to North Carolina, the nations
No. 1 team and defending National
Champion, 3-0. The trip did not
get much better. A 5-1 loss to No. 6
Wake Forest, followed by a 2-1 loss
to Maine and then a 2-0 defeat by
No. 5 Connecticut left the Wolver-
ines searching for answers.
Michigan returned home to face
a pair of non-conference foes, start-
ing with No.14 James Madison.
As soon as the game started, it
seemed like it couldn't end quickly
enough. The Dukes climbed to a
3-0 lead going into the half.
But it was a different Wolverine
squad coming out in the second
half.
Freshman Rachel Mack had a
potentially season-changing sec-
ond-half performance that turned
the tide for Michigan. Three min-
utes and seven seconds into the
second half, Mack seemed to don
the red cape with a large'"S" on it,
scoring on two penalty corners, the
first two goals of her career. Senior
captain Zara Saydjari evened it up
at 3-3 with 22:32 left to play.
"In the first four games, I hit
the post five times, which was very
frustrating ... It just felt really good
to get it in such a tight game as
well," Mack said.
As the game went into overtime,
it was just a matter of momentum
for the Wolverines to take over
the game. A brilliantly designed
corner by Michigan coach Marcia
Pankratz led to an extra pass and

a wide open shot for senior captain
Meredith Way. With that thud in
the back of the net a pile of Michi-
gan players jumped on Way in cel-
ebration.
"They are a strong, strong team
from a strong region ... we did not
want to shy away from a challenge,"
Pankratz said after the JMU game.
On Sunday, Central Michigan
came to Ann Arbor. The Wolverines
wouldn't overlook their opponent
after a 1-0 loss to the Chippewas
last season. This game ended quite
differently though. With two goals
from Vanessa Sekhon the Wolver-
ines captured a 4-0 shutout.
Though the season may have
started a little slow for Michigan,
the team has tallied eight goals in
their last three halves, compared to
just two in the previous nine.
Up next is Albany, a team that
just slipped into the top 20. Pan-
kratz is already looking ahead to
next weekend's battle.
"They are going to be polished
and quick, we will have our hands
full for sure," Pankratz said.
It's all about building experience
for Pankratz and her staff.
"Its good to get the younger
players in the match today, we have
some players that aren't feeling
well right now...a little under the
weather, hopefully we can get our
lineup solid and ready to roll forBig
Tens."
Encouraging signs from the
young Wolverines helped Michi-
gan get through the weekend. The
bright stars of the future includ-
ed freshman Rachel Mack, who
scored three goals, and goalkeeper
Haley Jones, who posted her first
career shutout in her first start as
a freshman. The seniors have also
produced, with captains Zara Sayd-
jari and Meredith Way scoring two
goals over the weekend.
The Wolverines ride a two-game
winning streak into a two-game
home stretch next weekend against
Albany and Quinnipiac. They hope
this can keep the momentum going
as they approach the heart of their
schedule in the next few weeks.
"More goals are just going to
keep coming," said Mack after Sun-
day's victory.

Freshman Soony Saad knocked in a header to give the Wolverines a1-0 lead in their 2-1 win over Oakland on Wednesday.

performance up a notch as the
time wound down to the last few
minutes.
With just 60 ticks left, Meram
received a cross from senior mid-
fielder and team captain Alex
Wood, and he put a bullet through
for the game-winner.
The Wolverines have come to
expect these second-half hero-
ics from their leaders, with six of
seven goals this season coming in
the final 45 minutes, but they cer-
tainly aren't taking that offensive
boost for granted.
For a defense that fended off
attackers all evening long, having
scorers like Meram and Saad take

the ball late in a match prompted a
giant sigh of relief.
"Every time the ball touches
their feet, I just have this instinct,
this sense they're going to score,"
sophomore defender Kofi Opare
said. "Soony is a clinical goal scor-
er, that's why he's here - to score
us goals. Look at his record, its
not going to lie. It says something
about his character and his abili-
ties.
"For Justin ... (it's) his ability,
his skill, his vision to spot team-
mates in tight situations (that)
makes him a great player."
Michigan appeared noticeably
fatigued after recently returning

from a weekend trip to Seattle,
but still found the energy to score
twice in the final 20 minutes.
Despite several carelesspasses and
missed opportunities on offense
earlier in the game, the Wolverines
outshot Oakland 24-7.
Michigan coach Steve Burns
said it's the team's perseverance
that will be vital as the season pro-
gresses.
"The college soccer season is like
the college football season," Burns
said. "It's a season of momentum.
Anytime you get a win, regardless
of how you win, everyone feeds off
that and looks forward to the next
game even more so."

Michigan's Kim
to play in Masters

Senior cornerback James Rogers (18) has changed positions multiple times in his career at Michigan, making two career starts at both wide receiver and corner
Rogers brings nothing

Cornerback has
veteran presence,
despite just two
starts on defense
By RYAN KARTJE
Daily SportsEditor
When senior cornerback Troy
Woolfolk went down with a season-
ending injury in August, it looked
as though the Wolverines had lost
all of their veteran presence in the
defensive backfield.
But there was one senior cor-
nerback - although he hadn't been
a cornerback for very long - who
kept coming up on the coaches'
radar.
Head coach Rich Rodriguez

knew that veteran leadership on yet most veteran, member of the
defense could make or break the secondary.
Wolverines in a number of games Head-to-head with All-Ameri-
this season. So he called on senior can-caliber wide receiver Michael
James Rogers, whose only starts to Floyd last week against the Irish,
date had come at wide receiver. Rogers kept Floyd in relative check
Many Michi- for much of the

on Monday. "I've been invaluable." Rogers saw

and play with enthusiasm." and then dart outside to finish
That strategy seems to have many of his athletic routes with a
worked for the not-so-experienced, reception. But before the Wolver-

ines' victory, Rogers had Floyd and
his moves figured out.
At least enough to hold him to
five catches for 66 yards.
Rodriguez said Rogers's perfor-
mance on the gridiron has been
"solid" in his two starts at corner,
but his biggest contribution may
be in filling Woolfolk's spot as the
group's de facto veteran teacher.
"When Troy went down, James
took control of that position,"
Rodriguez said. "He's the old man
of the group, surrounded by a
bunch of young guys and his vet-
eran leadership has really been
invaluable for us.".
And Rogers has taken that role,
as teacher, in stride, as several
members of the secondary have
pointed to his help as a huge part of
their success.
After all, with Woolfolk out for
the year and the team expected to
struggle in the defensive back-
field, Rogers' "nothing to lose"
attitude seemed to ring true for
the entire secondary.
"We're young, so the only thing
that came in our mind is that we
have to go out and have fun and
play with it," Rogers said. "There's
always been that weight on our
shoulders from the defensive
backfield anyway. When Troy
went down, I knew me as a senior,
I had to step up in my leadership
and make sure that these young
players are ready to play."
The Wolverines gave up the
second-most yards in a win in
school history against Notre
Dame last Saturday, including
two huge plays on offense that got
behind the secondary.
But despite the secondary's
poor play at times, Rogers knows a
win is a win, especially for a group
that was expected to struggle this
season.
"I think we justgo outthere and
play relentless," Rogers said. "If
something bad happens, you just
have to keep going out to play."

Senior becomes first
Michigan golfer in
71 years to qualify
By KEVIN RAFTERY
Daily Sports Writer
No matter what the Michigan
men's golf team accomplishes
this year, it will be hard to beat
what senior Lion Kim has already
achieved.
On July 17th, Kim did what only
one other Wolverine has done in
the history of Michigan golf. He
qualified for the Masters, the most
prestigious professional golf tour-
nament in the world. The last was
Chuck Kocsis, who did it 71 years
ago.
Kim qualified by defeating
David McDaniel of Tucson, Ari-
zona 6-and-5 in the final round of
match play at the 85th U.S. Ama-
teur Public Links Championship in
Greensboro, NC.
But it was the way he qualified
that makes the featcthat muchmore
remarkable.
Competing against a field of 156
of America's best amateur golfers,
Kim faced a long and difficult jour-
ney to the finals, to say the least.
He would have to finish in the top
64 after two rounds of stroke play,
and then he would have to win five
match play matches in a span of
three days in orderto make it to the
36-hole final.
"In every tournament I play
in, I always feel like I have a good
chance to win," Kim said. "And
part of that is because I know I've
prepared pretty well for every
event. Coming into this tourna-
ment, I had a lotofconfidence and I
just told myself, 'Stick to your game
plan.'"
That confidence would be key
for Kim as he weaved his way
through the brackets.
After shooting 70-73 in the
stroke-play rounds, Kim breezed
through the first four rounds of
match play with little trouble. But
in the semifinals, he found himself
downby two holes to Kevin Phelan,
a sophomore at the University of
North Florida, with just six to play.
"Even thoughI was two down, I
still felt confident about my game,"
Kim said. "I just told myself that I
just need to win one hole, and if I do
that, I know I'll get the momentum
back."
Kim eagled the 15th to close the
gap to one, and he birdied 17 and 18
to seal the match.
"That was actually the tough-
est match out of the six matches I
won," Kim said, "because we had
to win holes with birdies and even
with eagles. Kevin is a greatplayer."
But it was in the 36-hole final
match when Kim's mental abilities
were challenged to the fullest.
After completing the first 12
holes with a two-hole lead, rain
moved into the area and officials
were forced to call for a rain delay.
Seven hours later,Kim and McDan-
iel were still sitting inthe clubhouse
waiting for the delayto end.
"It was a long seven hours, and
it felt even longer because I was so
anxious to get back up knowing
that I'm so close to winning the
tournament," Kim said.

Luckily for Kim, he had his good
luck charm there to help keep him
calm and focused.
"I have to give all the credit to
my mom," he said. "We talked a
lot. She kept me relaxed. We talked
about everything, even from my
childhood days and about what her
childhood days were like."
Finally, at 4:51 p.m. - seven
hours and eight minutes from
when the delay was called - play
resumed. And when Kim stepped
back on the course, he picked up
right where he left off. He won
holes 13 and 14 and immediately
took a four-hole lead. From there,
he would have no troubles - that
is, until Mother Nature stepped in
again, threatening to prolong the
tournament once again.
Heading into number 13 for the
second time around, Kim held a
commanding seven-stroke lead
with seven holes to play. But as
both players headed to the tee box,
darkness engulfed the area. Kim
and McDaniel could barely see five
feet in front of them, let alone fol-
low a golf ball hundreds of yards. A
rules official approached both play-
ers to ask whatcthey wanted to do.
"It was pitch dark," Kim
recalled. "I was really close to
closing the match up. I just told
him, 'Hey, let's keep playing.' I just
thought that momentum was on
my side and I had a pretty big lead,
and I think he pretty much knew
thathisbestchanceofwinningwas
really done at that point."
Minutes later, Kim found him-
self staring down an eight-foot par
putt in the dark to win the tourna-
ment. Somehow, he made the putt
with only the ability to see his ball
and the cup, and he had officially
earned himself a bid to the Mas-
ters.
"That feeling is what all golfers
live for," Kim said. "I've been wait-
ingfor averylongtime to win agolf
tournament, and to finally get my
first big win under my belt was a
huge relief. One of the first things
that popped into my head was, 'It's
official. I'mgoing toget an invite to
the Masters.' And that is truly awe-
some."
In less than seven months, Kim
will be playing alongside seasoned
pros such as Phil Mickelson, Jim
Furyk, and yes - Tiger Woods.
"It'd be a dream come true to
play alongside Tiger Woods at a
major championship," Kim said.
"In my opinion, he is the best ath-
lete in the world. If that happens it
will be a life-changing experience,
golf-wise."
It is an incredible feat for any-
one, even the professionals, to
qualify for the Masters. But for a
college playerAlmost unheard of.
"Just the exposure that this will
give our program is huge," Michi-
gan head coach Andrew Sapp said.
"The Michigan bag is going to be
seen on CBS, worldwide. It is one
of those accomplishments for our
programthat really proves that you
can be a championship golfer at the
University of Michigan, and Lion
has proven that. I think it will help
in recruiting, and I think it will
help our current players as well"
"It'll truly be an honor for me to
represent the block 'M' at Augusta
National," Kim said. "I'm going to
do everything I can to represent
the University of Michigan well."

or a fledgling local theater
company aiming to devel-
op a rock star-esque fol-
lowing, a concert version
of a brilliant 20th-century
anti-war play makes for
he ultimate second production.
The New Theatre Project's New
Ensemble, a group of 20-something art-
ists led by founder and Creative Direc-
tor Keith Paul Medelis, certainly shares
some traits with a rock band already.
Experimentation and collaboration
are key words for the group, as illus-
trated by its edgy and inventive first
production, this past summer's "The
Spring Awakening Project," along with
the scheduled plays for its first season,
themed "Identity." And its members
want to use those traits to win over a
young audience.
But not to be ignored is the members'
contagious shared enthusiasm - verg-
ing on radical artistic devotion - that
powers their innovative project.
TNTP originally planned its sec-
ond production as a one-night, 16-per-
son staged reading of Bertolt Brecht's
groundbreaking 1941 anti-war play
"Mother Courage and Her Children" in
Ypsilanti's Frog Island Park.
But the first-rate cast of leads had to
withdraw three weeks before the Sept.
19 event because of scheduling con-
flicts, causing a last-minute scramble.
With the staged reading no longer a
possibility, the New Ensemble took up
a "wouldn't it be cool if" idea that had
been languishing in the back of its mem-

bers' minds.
"Brecht as a rock concert in a club
atmosphere," Medelis explained.
The one-night "Mother Courage
in Concert" on Sept. 19 will now take
place with a full band and orchestra-
tions in Main Street's Elmo's Hideaway.
New Ensemble members Caleb Kruzel,
an 18-year-old student at Washtenaw
Technical Middle College, and Amanda
Lyn Jungquist, a 21-year-old LSA senior
at the University, wrote original music
to go with the play's existing score.
"Itwillbefun,but we'lljusthaveto hit
this thing hard for a while," Jungquist
said about the shift to a concert format.
Eastern Michigan University associ-
ate professor and local Brecht expert Dr.
Pirooz Aghssa will conduct a pre-show
discussion about the playwright, and
the New Ensemble will read portions of
the play throughout the performance to
frame the songs. The production is list-
ed on the United Nations International
Day of Peace website, and Ann Arbor's
5th annual P.E.A.C.E. DAY on Sept. 19
on the Diag will feature selections from
the production.
The show, perhaps now more than
before, keeps with the mission of TNTP,
part of which is to reinvent old work for
a new audience and part of which is to
present work that was revolutionary
when it premiered.
"I want something you aren't going to
forget about," 22-year-old Medelis told
the Daily in his "office" - Cafe Verde in
the People's Food Co-op. "A lot of the-
ater is lukewarm, but this is not luke-

The "awakening" of the
New Ensemble
"The Spring Awakening Project," the
equally hot inaugural work inspired
by Frank Wedekind's 1891 play "Spring
Awakening," was entirely responsible
for the TNTP's ascent into local theater
stardom - but not before inspiring the
group's creation.
"The Spring Awakening Project" fol-
lowed six characters in a unified plot to
explore the transition between child-
hood and adulthood with topics such as
sex, homosexuality, social pressure and
suicide. The play drew attention and
acclaim this summer.
Medelis was an apprentice at Ann
Arbor's Performance Network theater
and a recent graduate of Albion Col.-
lege when he began to develop the play
last winter. He ventured to start TNTP
because of the success of "The Spring
Awakening Project" and the cast with
which he was working.
But it was where the content origi-
nated as much as the content itself that
boosted interest in TNTP. The innova-
tive six-month development process
created for the play by Medelis and the
cast has become widely admired in the
Ann Arbor theater scene.
In January, Medelis got permission to
produce his own adaptation of "Spring
Awakening" - distinguished from the
2006 Broadway rock musical of the same
name - in the Performance Network's PHOTOS BY MARISSA MCCLAIN

Why even read a single page
when the cover tells the whole story?

SINGLE REVIEW
Sufjan Stevens
"Too Much"
Asthmatic Kitty

/ t Y.,.

There was a time when Sufjan Ste-
vens had alot of potential, but now it
kind of seems like he's been around
too long without doing much of sub-
stance. In that sense, new single
"Too Much" is the epitome of Sufjan.
The track starts out promising,
with little bursts of tuneless glitch
only gradually gaining a beat. And
it stays interesting for awhile, as Suf
proves that he can use electronica
to do what he does best - namely,
whine aboutvaguely intelligible, usu-
ally personal fuck-ups in an about-to-
cry voice, but still somehow capture
listeners with precious multi-part
accompaniments and a clear ear for
melody. Clearly the guy has oodles of
talent in any medium.
But, just like Sufjan's "50 States"
fizzler, the concept dies out quickly
- about four minutes in, when lis-
teners will doubtless realize they've
just spent half the song keyed into the
same tired chorus, "There's too much
riding on that," sung over the same
patterns of computer rambling.
Yes, it does eventually build up into
a celebration of screechy and fluttery
noises coming together in harmony.
And yeah, it's pretty cool how Ste-
vens's clever woodwind glissandos
and string ostinatos and trumpet
scale patterns blend into something
that's anything but classical in that
final minute-and-a-half.
But is that worth the track's six
(going on seven) long minutes, or is
the whole thing about as self-centered
as deciding to bestow a personalized
albumupon every state in the Union?

President Barack Obama is busy being the
leader of the free world while being a dad and
husband, but he can still find time to pen a chil-
dren's book. President Obama will make his
kid-lit debut on Nov. 16 with the sure-to-be-
bestseller "of Thee I Sing."
The book is dedicated to his daughters and
details their journeys and crazy hijinks. Sasha
and Malia Obama jump at the chance to take
Bo for a walk, but really they'll do anything to
avoid eating their green eggs and ham. While
out walking, they hop aboard the Polar Express
and travel into the land of the Wild Things (an
allegory for the White House perhaps?) armed

leading the way.
While Obama's use of synecdoche, verisimil-
itude and malapropisms are to be applauded for
successfully illuminating the inner conflicts of
childhood, his attempt at metonymy and fore-
shadowing were catastrophic at best. It was
painstakingly clear what was to happen when
Sasha gave the mouse a cookie, and worse, it
veered the narrative off course as said mouse
proceeded to ask for a glass of milk.
In short, "Of Thee I Sing" will gain success
as a novelty with readers clamoring to devour
the musings of the man who brought you health
care. However, it is unlikely Obama will be
placing a Pulitzer next to his Nobel prize - but
with Obama, who really knows?

"I'm on cloud nine. Can't you tell?"
The latter, definitely. If "Too
Much" is any indication for The Age
ofAdz - slated for release Oct. 12 -
then it's not exactly a leap forward
for Sufjan. Instead, it's like sidestep-

TNTP

small black-box theater. He then
asked friend, playwright and
fellow Albion graduate Jason
Sebacher to join him in his adven-
ture.
Sebacher, 24, who was working
in Chicago as a high school Eng-
lish teacher, heartily agreed, and
Medelis cast six people ranging in
age from 18 to 22 to play the teen-
age characters. It quickly became
apparent that they would be much
more than actors.
Medelis asked the cast to
answer what he pinpointed as "the
question" of the play: "When was
the momentcwhen you realized that
you were no longer a child?"
The cast members, who now
form the New Ensemble, journaled
together in workshops multiple
times a month for six months to
answer that question and many
other prompts. They wrote up to
15 pages each per workshop, and
Medelis sent the entries to Sebacher
to construct scenes with.
"We shared the most personal
details," said Austin Michael Tracy,
21, a Theater Arts and Arts Man-
agement student at Eastern Michi-
gan University who wrote 28 pages
(front and back) during the journal-
ing process. "Like, everyone in the
cast knows my entire sex life."
Medelis knew he wanted to use
the material in creating the final
product, but the process was uncer-
tain in the beginning.
"(Medelis's) idea was you'd take
the life and words and talents and
true stories of the cast and integrate
them with the stories of the char-
acters - somehow," Sebacher said.
"That he left up to me."
Sebacher, who is now playwright-
in-residence for TNTP, wrote
scenes and sent them to the cast and
Medelis for feedback. Both the cast
and Sebacher wrote plenty of useful
material that didn't make it into the
final product, but about two-thirds
of the script was the cast's own
words.
"If one actor had been different,
the whole play would have been
totally different because we would

have had a different story," Medelis
said. "The play literally cannot exist
without an ensemble of people cre-
ating it; they are not replaceable
people."
It came as a surprise to the cast
that so much of the script came from
their journals.
"All of the sudden we started get-
ting little chunks of scenes, and we
were like, 'That's my writing, that's
my story.' We just started playing
our lives," Tracy said.
Tracy added that no one acted his
or her own story. Rather, the actors
played each other.
"I never once said a line that was
my own," Tracy said. "But I can say
that at one point or another in the
play, everyone in the cast said a line
that was my own."
Meanwhile, every cast member
began totake on other roles beyond
writing and acting.
Kruzel composed an entirely
original score. Matt Anderson, now
the group's managing director, cho-
reographed dance elements. Ben
Stange, a 2010 graduate of the Uni-
versity's School of Music, Theatre
& Dance, designed costumes. And
Jungquist became the company
photographer.
Although Medelis didn't cast
the show intending to capture such
diverse talent, he wasn'tjust looking
for polished actors, either.
"When I cast a show, I look at
who you are as a human being and
as an artist, not necessarily if you're
a really good actor," Medelis said.
"But I found that when you are so
connected with the play, your act-
ing steps up hundreds of notches
because you care so much about it."
The rest of the New Ensemble
agrees.
"We got so much creative input,
and that was what was so inspiring
and what made me really grow as an
actor," Kruzel said.
After Sebacher created the final
storyboard and script, the group had
three-and-a-half weeks to rehearse,
meeting every day for six hours. The
cast members adored the outcome,
perhaps even more because they
put so much oftheir time, talent and
personal stories into the play.
"I was able to really put my all
into it, because this is me, it's my
words," Tracy said. "We all put 150

percent into it and were able to cre-
ate something new and beautiful."
"The Spring Awakening Proj-
ect" was originally only slated to
show at the Performance Network
for four days in June, so Medelis
decided to start his own theater to
continue the show for another three
weeks in a small performance space
in the local Pot & Box flower shop.
The soon-to-be New Ensemble was
surprised but thrilled to extend the
show.
"It was like, 'Wait, of course we
have to continue with this thing
- this is amazing, and we're put-
ting so much time and energy in,'"
Jungquist said.
There was some worry over
whether the New Ensemble would
go over well with the local audience,
especially because the Ann Arbor
area only has a handful of theaters
and thus fewer opportunities for
emerging groups.
"There was a lot of hoopla about
whether or not we could be taken
seriously," Jungquist said. "So
we felt a lot of pressure initially
to make the show really good to
kind of build a reputation for our-
selves."
Enthusiastic responses to "The
Spring Awakening Project"
eased any qualms about TNTP.
"People saw that we are not
just some group of kids who are
getting together to put on some
half-ass mediocre production,"
Tracy explained. "A lot of people
left, not to honk my own horn,
but they left saying ,that it was
the first piece of legitimate the-
ater they had seen in a long time."
News of the show spread by
Facebook and word of mouth,
and audiences grew larger each

week. By the show's last weekend
in the beginning of August, TNTP
had such a demand that it had to
add another performance - which
also sold out.
The popularity of "The Spring
Awakening Project" bodes well
for TNTP, but the art of theater
has always been an experiment for
Medelis and the New Ensemble.
"If it fails, that's something
that's perfectly acceptable,"
Medelis said. "And if it's my life's
work and becomes this big thing,
that's also perfectly acceptable.
"We're all young. We're trying
a lot of things and taking a lot of
risks that I hope are meaningful
and people care about. But ulti-
mately the idea is to create art in
the present."
Risky innovations
It's that spirit of risk-taking that
the New Ensemble and its champi-
ons believe has made and will con-
tinue to make TNTP important.
The process of collaborative play-
writing developed during "The
Spring Awakening Project" was
the group's first original creation.
"No one has experienced this
(method) before, to my knowl-
edge, and we've checked," said
Sebacher, who recently started the
M.F.A. program in Theater Arts
at Carnegie Mellon. "It is unprec-
edented and a wholly novel way to
approach playmaking."
Sebacher explained that improv
and adaptations are both popular,
but TNTP's process takes a differ-
ent angle.
"The actual process of getting to
know people, playing games with
them, journaling with them, inter-

viewing them, taking their stories
and talents and actual words and
mixing them up with a canonical
text has not been done before," he
said.
Theater expert Davi Napoleon,
who graduated from the Univer-
sity and has a M.A. in drama and a
Ph.D. in performance studies from
NYU, followed and documented
the production process for "The
Spring Awakening Project" for
her blog on thefastertimes.com.
She also recognized the process as
unique.
"They're adventurous, they're
committed to what they're
doing, they're excited about what
they're doing and they're taking a
chance," Napoleon said in a phone
interview.
Some work encourages actors to
think about how they personally
relate to the script, she explained,
and the 1975 Broadway musical "A
Chorus Line" features individual
stories based on the lives of the
actors. But those don't start with
a classic text and are not orga-
nized around a unified story. "The
Spring Awakening Project" was
new, and thus inherently risky.
"It's different than taking
Shakespeare and knowing that
you've got something solid," Napo-
leon said. "But when you risk that
kind of failure, you can also really
make a contribution to the future
of theater."
Although Napoleon said it's
much too early to say what TNTP
will add to the future of theater,
she likes where the group is head-
ing.
"Clearly they're taking the kind
of risks that make it possible to
make a contribution," Napoleon
said. "That's the only way that the-
ater can progress from what it has
been to what it will be."
Medelis plans to continue to
run the theater collaboratively.
The company's meetings to plan
and market shows are open to the
whole New Ensemble, and every-
one in the group is encouraged to
contribute ideas. In the future,
Medelis hopes to have the New
Ensemble pick the season's shows
and theme collaboratively.
"The theater is really inherently
hierarchical, and it really kind
of pisses me off," Medelis said,
referencing his time as a theater
apprentice. "I don't find it interest-
ing to walk all over people."
A younger theater movement
The members of the New
Ensemble believe that their exper-
imental perspective on theater is
drawn in part from their age.
"We're all so willing to change
the way that theater is normally
viewed, creating new things that
we've never seen before because
we're all trying to find our own
voices," Stange said. "TNTP pro-
vides this outlet to get our ideas
heard rather than being thrown
into an established theater com-
pany where things happen from
the top down."
TNTP's youthful energy seems
contagious for Ann Arbor's
young people. The theater has
had an unusually young audience
so far, Medelis said.
For "The Spring Awakening
Project" in particular, far more

student tickets were sold than
adult tickets.
"It's really important to me
to do relevant, good work that's
important to young people," he
said. "The (Performance) Networl*
is really struggling right now to
get anyone under the age of 60
through the door, and that's just
depressing.
"But 'Spring Awakening' was
very much made for young people,
about young people."
"We were just short of mak-
ing a goddamn checklist about
why young people don't go to the
theater," Sebacher said. He and
Medelis instead brainstormed ele-
ments of theater that would bring
young people.
Some of the cast, many of whom
have extensive experience in com-
munity and college theater, were
surprised by the large audiences
"The Spring Awakening Project'*
drew.
"Really, this whole thing
stemmed out of a bunch of kids
wanting to do something differ-
ent, and it's kind of amazing how
much it's grown," Stange said.
But Sebacher sees the poten
tial for even more growth in Ann
Arbor, adding that TNTP wants to
convert new theatergoers.
"You've got all of these young
people, and it's kind of a cool,
hip town," Sebacher said of Ann
Arbor. "The goal is to get a name
and have people follow you like
you're a rock band."
The New Ensemble agrees that
TNTP is well on its way to becom-
ing part of the Ann Arbor theater
scene - and creating a new young
audience for the stage.
TNTP has a season of provoca-
tive and experimental plays and
staged readings themed around
"identity" planned through sum-
mer 2011, including an original by
Sebacher next summer. The nex4
major six-month "Project" is "The
Everyman Project" scheduled for
next April.
It will be an experiment, this
time directed by New Ensemble
member and MT&D graduate Ben
Stange and written by Franc4
Vitella, to see whether the collab-
orative writing process developed
under "The Spring Awakening
Project" can work again with a dif-
ferent outmoded play and a slightly
different cast. The New Ensemble
is working with "Everyman," an
anonymous 15th century morality
play about a dying man who has
to decide what virtue to take with
him in the afterlife so that he can
get into heaven.
Five of the six New Ensemble
members from "The Spring Awak-
ening Project" will join "The Every-
man Project," and a few more will
be added. They have yet to decide
"the question" to begin journaling
around.
"It really worked for 'Spring*
Awakening,' and I think it can real-
ly work for lots of things," Medelis
saidof the process. "But we'll find
out."
Experimental though it may be,
TNTP doubtless has an audience
intrigued by its first production.
"Mother Courage in Concert" will
launch a tempting first season.
No doubt, its fans certainly hope
the New Ensemble isn't the latest
one-hit wonder.

There are two things I will
keep with me forever
upon my graduation from
the University of Michigan, along
with my degree
in one hand
and a pile of
debt in another. '
One of them is

was younger, XU
I could never
understand
how obsessed my parents would
get with remodeling their per-
fectly fine kitchen or redecorating
their garden with even more use-
less masses of brick and mulch.
But standing in my one-bedroom
apartment with the smelly sink
and the window that only opens a
crack, I feel so much homeowner's
pride I could burst.
Above the couch, there's my
"America's Next Top Model"
shrine and some weird pages I
ripped from Nylon that say "The
revolution will be televised." On
top of the couch, a miniature
Charlie Brown-esque evergreen
tree that my roommate bought
from Meijer last Christmas. And
then there are the pictures of
Woody Allen scattered around
every corner; the posters of
"Trainspotting," "Lolita," "Away
We Go," "Eternal Sunshine of
the Spotless Mind" and "Gosford
Park" framing my bed; the photo-
graph of a tight-shirted Michael
Vartan winking cheekily at my
roommate and me whenever we
go to brush our teeth.
And thoughI am not usually
one to dispense advice, I believe
that, in the spirit of the nation,
we should encourage the public to
partake in a little Martha Stewart.
And so, some not-very-helpful tips
on apartment/dorm decorating:
Themes are always good -

Chill homespun act
to spread the good
vibes in A2 tonight
By SHARON JACOBS
Assistant Arts Editor
It's a little surprising that the
three members of NYC-based
School of Seven
Bells have
embraced live
audiences. The SeVen Bells
band's intimate, .
homemade style Toght at
suggests a shyer 9 pli. .i
group, but the The Blind Pig
band is sure to $12
greet its crowd at
the Blind Pig tonight with enthusi-
asm.
"When we made (our) first
record ... we knew we were going to
play live, but we didn't realize that
! we were going to love it as much as
we do," guitarist Benjamin Cur-
tis said in an interview with the
Daily. After completing Alpinisms,
its worldly and otherworldly 2008
debut, School of Seven Bells took
off for a year of touring.
* "It was amazing," Curtis said,
"connect(ing) with people and
just discovering this really intense
energy. We weren't really aware of
the power there."
It was while on tour in Europe
that Curtis and identical twin
bandmates Claudia and Alejan-
dra Deheza were inspired to start
writing their second album, Dis-
connect from Desire. More emo-

tional than its predecessor, Desire
retains the band's wispy, ethereal
sound.
"All these ideas started coming
to me really quickly," explained
Curtis, who handles the band's
dreamy and sparse music while the
Dehezas write and harmonize the
lyrics.
"I'm deaf and I blast my head-
phones," he continued. "Ally and
Claudia started writing, just from
the headphone bleed."
Before Desire was completed,
the band had already found its title
in a mystical deck of cards - Brian
Eno and Peter Schmidt's "Oblique
Strategies."
"They made it as a tool for art-
ists ... to help you out of a cre-
ative problem," he said. Alejandra
Deheza drew a card that read "dis-
connect from desire," a message
Curtis said resonated with the
band.
"We knew we were going to
write a record that was sort of a lot
more personal and original."
While School of Seven Bells
certainly concocts its own origi-
nal blend of delicate melodies and
slowly shifting accompaniments,
it's often boxed in with a shoegaze
label and treated with a string of
My Bloody Valentine and Coc-
teau Twins references. Curtis is
resigned to the shoegaze tag but
still finds it limiting in some ways.
"I think everyone has a little
shelf that they need to put things
in, and I'm fine with that," he said.
"What's unfortunate about it is,
it seems like more often than not,
labels scare people away from

nd Pg
music than steer people toward it.
"There's a lot more subtleties to
the genre terms than most people
think about."
Veterans of music biz label-
ing and terminology, Curtis and
the Deheza twins met while their
former bands (Secret Machines
and On!Air!Library!, respectively)
were both supporting Interpol.
Curtis soon left his old band to
focus on School of Seven Bells.
"There's a certain delicacy to
our music that doesn't really exist
in the Secret Machines," Curtis
said, "there's just a bigger dynam-
ic. And I kind of like to explore
that a little bit more."
But one thing that Secret
Machines does have in common
with School of Seven Bells is fam-
ily ties: In the former band, Curtis
played alongside his brother Bran-
don Curtis; in the latter, he shares
the stage with two sisters.
"They have a particular way
of talking to each other that I
don't think anyone else can really
understand, kind of like a lan-
guage, like a tone," Curtis said.
"It's hard to read, but it's cool."
And Curtis remains unfazed by
the duo's closeness.
"If there's anything I feel left
out of, I'm probably glad that I
feel left out of it," he said. "Family
dynamic's pretty intense."
Maybe it's that intense family
aspect that gives School of Seven
Bells shows that special intensity
- based more on crisp harmonies
and communicative lyrics than a
big sound - that will be on dis-
play tonight.

FILM NOTEBOOK
Lamentations of the rich and famous .

The moviegoing public
shouldn't be deluged
with celebs' problems
By ANDREW LAPIN
Senior Arts Editor
"I'm Still Here," that movie about
how much Joaquin Phoenix hates
being Joaquin Phoenix, opens at the
State Theater tomorrow. And it serves
as a preview for a holiday movie season
filled with a surprising level of upper-
crust narcissism for a country that's
supposedly still getting over a reces-
sion. Not since the Great Depression
has there been a greater discrepancy
between the lifestyles of the general
American public and the lifestyles
depicted in the movies being marketed
to them.
Let's start with that aforementioned
self-loathing documentary, or maybe
it's a mockumentary. More likely it's
simply a fuck-you-mentary. I haven't
had the privilege of sitting through
Casey Affleck's wonderful social exper-
iment, but everything I've read and
heard about it tells me there are only a
few things that are confirmed about it:
1. It features scenes in which Phoe-
nix - he of the dual Oscar nominations
- does drugs, engages in explicit acts
with various women and tells everyone
how much he wants to abandon all his
acting prestige and fame.
2. It expects you to care about his
problems.
Now don't get me wrong, there's a
very good chance that Phoenix really
did have an awful breakdown and needs
actual psychiatric care, in which case,
yes, he would be very much deserving
of the public's sympathy. (Why his own
brother-in-law would choose to distrib-
ute a film about his sorrows for profit
instead of seeking professional help
is another issue entirely.) But there's
an equally good chance that at least a
large chunk of"I'm Still Here" is a sham
designed to prey on the audience's per-
ceived sympathies for rich, famous peo-
ple. And that's what troubles me.

Phoenix was never an A-list celeb-
rity, necessarily - at least, not along
the lines of Johnny Depp or George
Clooney. He was someone who could
have legitimately announced his early
retirement from acting without raising
too much of a fuss ... after all, we can't
be expected to keep tabs on every single
name in Hollywood that penetrates the
collective consciousness. That's what
makes the very idea of "I'm Still Here"
appalling in its own way: Right there in
the title is the implication that we - as
a nation - were wringing our hands in
utter worry over the plight of this guy.
"Don'tworry, everyone,"thatmovie's
poster is announcing, with its extreme
close-up of a scraggly, homeless-looking
Phoenix. "I'm still here. But I'm a little
worse for the wear, and because I'm a
celebrity, I want to air my psychologi-
cal problems for all the world. Because
you see, it wasn't enough for me to make
more money and enjoy more success
than all of you people. I also needed to
let you know just how little my life was
satisfying me."
The feel-bad-for-the-celebrity gim-
mick is nothing new in cinema. In
fact, some of the greatest works of the
medium ("Sunset Boulevard," "All
About Eve," etc.) have come out of that
very concept. And earlier this summer
we got "Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work,"
a slightly more genuine documentary
about a celebrity figure, which earned
rave reviews for its depiction of the fick-
le nature of fame. But when the same
subject keeps reappearing, even when
it's supposedly being handled tactfully,
someone in Hollywood should prob-
ably start answering questions about
just how far we want to "escape" in our
movies.
Over. Christmas break we'll be
treated to a double dose of Problems
of the Rich and Famous. There's Sofia
Coppola's "Somewhere," a "Funny
People"-esque drama about a wealthy
actor (Stephen Dorff) lost in his giant
mansion, who must have a Big Think
about his life when his young daughter
(Ele Fanning) re-enters it. And then
there's James L. Brooks's "How Do You
Know," a love triangle where two out

of the three corners are professional
athletes (played by Reese Witherspoon
and Owen Wilson). To be fair, the third
corner of the triangle is a successful
businessman (Paul Rudd) on the verge
of losing his company, so maybe that
will make everything OK. How do you
know?
The presence of "Somewhere" isn't
that surprising considering the source.
After all, Coppola was behind the
decade's defining actor-in-existential-
crisis drama, 2003's "Lost in Transla-
tion." And it makes perfect sense that
a filmmaker growing up within the
Coppola family would want to return
time and time again to these familiar
themes. "Write what you know," my
creative writing teachers have told me
since elementaryschool. If allyou know
is the upper class, odds are good your
works might have a pretty consistent
theme.
"Somewhere" recentlywonthe Gold-
en Lion at the Venice Film Festival - the
top prize. Head juror Quentin Taran-
tino said the vote was unanimous. So
for the moment, at least, the subgenre
of movies about rich-people problems is
here to stay. But the issue at hand is how
much longer audiences will want to see
movies like these.
I admit that all this bitterness is
based on speculation, and that these
movies could easily surprise me by
speaking to audiences of all creeds. But
regardless of the quality of films like
this, what are we left with? Celebri-
ties bein' celebrities, not even trying to
make a connection with us lowly com-
moners. Or worse, these are their Bar-
ton Fink-like attempts to connect with
us in as isolated a manner as possible.
Eventually we'll probably realizethat
Joaquin Phoenix and Sophia Coppola
aren't the best refractors of the popular
experience. I know it's the movie indus-
try's job to present us with a wide vari-
ety of stories and a cross-section of the
human experience. Celebrities, even
those tortured by levels of wealth that
most people in the country would kill
for, are still a part of that. But it doesn't
have to be our job to sympathize with
them.
