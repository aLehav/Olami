ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Following enrollment 

report, groups say 
bump is step in the 

right direction

By ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

Though the University’s fall 

2015 enrollment data reported 
the 
highest 
proportion 
of 

underrepresented minorities in 
a decade, leaders of Black, Latin 
American and Native American 
student groups say the current 
numbers leave more to be desired.

Underrepresented minorities 

make up 12.8 percent of this 
year’s freshman class, up 2.8 
percent from last year’s incoming 
cohort of first-years. The last 
time the percentage of incoming 
underrepresented 
minority 

students was this high was in 
2005, when they collectively 
made up 13.8 percent of first-year 
students.

In 2013, minority students 

— Black students in particular 

— brought the issue of campus 
diversity and inclusion to the 
forefront of University concerns 
by popularizing the Twitter 
hashtag #BBUM, or “Being Black 
at the University of Michigan.”

Social media responses with 

the hashtag, which went viral, 
detailed ways Black students felt 
uncomfortable at the University 
due 
to 
microaggressions 

or 
explicit 
forms 
of 
racial 

harassment.

The 
#BBUM 
campaign 

heightened 
work 
between 

leaders of the Black Student 
Union, other minority groups on 
campus and the administration 
to make campus more welcoming 
to students of different ethnic 
groups — both by way of 
on-campus 
climate 
and 
in 

admissions. The University has 
outlined several new initiatives 
to increase the diversity of the 
student body, within the confines 
of the state of Michigan’s ban 
on affirmative action. Those 
programs so far have included 
increased outreach to specific 
school districts, the creation of 

Business junior 
Taylor Janssen is 
in intensive rehab 
after July accident

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

Business junior Taylor Janssen 

was playing beach volleyball 
with his friends when the 

accident occurred. He had dived 
into shallow water to retrieve the 
ball and hit his head on the rocky, 
shallow ground. Janssen severed 
his C5 vertebrae.

That was in July. Monday 

night, 
approximately 
100 

students gathered on the Diag for 
an evening of prayer dedicated, 
who is currently in intensive 
rehabilitation, but was released 
from the hospital Friday and was 
able to go home for the first time.

Business junior Seth Johnson, 

Janssen’s friend and fellow Phi 
Kappa Psi fraternity member, 
organized the event and retold 
the story of Janssen’s injury.

“Following that, his friends 

realized something was wrong 
so they got him out of the water 
and notified the police,” Johnson 
said. “They took him in an 
ambulance to the University 
of Michigan Hospital Trauma 
Center where he underwent 
multiple surgeries. They weren’t 
sure if he was going to make 

it, but eventually he pulled 
through.”

Monday’s 
event 
concluded 

with a candle-lighting ceremony 
and a moment of silence in 
support of Janssen, who was also 
on hand in the Diag. Afterward, 
he said he appreciated the 
encouragement 
that 
he 
has 

received.

“It’s truly amazing to see 

all the support and everyone 
come out,” Janssen said. “It’s

‘An Evening with 

Drew Barrymore’ to 
cover new memoir 

‘Wildflower’

By CAROLINE FILIPS

Daily Arts Writer

It’s hard to mention Drew 

Barrymore without referencing 
her 
tumultuous 
childhood. 

Though 
the 

perils of fame 
plagued 
her 

formative years 
— 
habitual 

nightclubbing 
as a pre-teen, 
rehab by age 
14, 
living 

on 
her 
own 

and 
dealing 

with 
familial 

instability 
through it all — 
Barrymore prevailed with poise. 
Today, her repertoire continues 
to expand: she identifies as an 
actress, 
director, 
producer, 

philanthropist, author, mother 
and co-founder of the cosmetic 
company Flower Beauty.

Throughout 
her 
four 

decades with a public audience, 

Barrymore 
has 
accumulated 

an arsenal of life lessons. She 
first shared her uncensored, 
cautionary tale in 1990, focusing 
on her deviant youth in “Little 
Girl 
Lost.” 
Barrymore’s 

newest memoir, “Wildflower” 
chronicles her turbulent past 
and deems it essential to her 
present 
— 
admittedly 
her 

happiest, married to actor Will 
Kopelman and mother to two 
toddlers Olive and Frankie. 
In the recent November issue 
of InStyle magazine — the 
third time the publication’s 
editor 
Ariel 
Foxman 
has 

elected Barrymore cover girl — 
Barrymore admits her conscious 
decision 
to 
disregard 
her 

inaugural narrative as she wrote 
“Wildflower.”

“It’s in my room, in the 

‘Barrymore library’ — the stack 
of all the dusty old hardcover 
books my family has written, 
from my Aunt Diana’s ‘Too 
Much, Too Soon’ to everything 
that Ethel, Lionel and John 
(Barrymore) wrote. ‘Little Girl 
Lost’ belongs in that crazy 
category, and I’m glad it’s there, 
but I didn’t want to be influenced 
this time around,” Barrymore 
said in the interview.

 Provost previously 
pledged to pause 
plans based on 
assembly vote

By GENEVIEVE HUMMER

Daily Staff Reporter

An overwhelming majority 

of the University’s Faculty 
Senate voted in favor of a 
proposal to delay the release 
of course evaluation data until 
faculty, students and experts 
can reach a consensus on a new 
instrument of evaluation.

The vote was planned after 

James 
Holloway, 
the 
vice 

provost for global and engaged 
education, 
announced 
the 

University could implement 
plans 
to 
release 
course 

evaluation data as early as this 
semester at a Senate Advisory 
Committee 
on 
University 

Affairs meeting Oct. 12.

According 
to 
the 
plan 

Holloway 
presented, 
the 

University would release all 
numerical data from student 
course evaluations through 
a 
website 
accessible 
only 

to those with a University 
uniqname. Comments written 
on 
the 
evaluations 
would 

not be released, nor would 
the 
data 
collected 
from 

course evaluations of classes 
taught by graduate student 

instructors or instructors with 
fewer than seven terms of 
teaching experience.

At Monday’s Faculty Senate 

meeting, 
faculty 
members 

engaged 
in 
an 
hour-long 

discussion about the potential 
implications of releasing course 
evaluation data to students.

Weineck 
opened 
the 

conversation by sharing faculty 
input she has received over 
the past several weeks both 
in favor of and opposed to the 
release of data.

Those in favor of releasing 

the data said current course 
evaluations, while not perfect, 
would be a better resource for 
students than ratings posted on

University 

faculty kick off 
yearlong series of 

discussions

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

According to a 2015 Pew 

Research Center report, 6.9 
percent of all Americans 18 and 
older identify as multiracial. 
According to the University’s 
Office of the Registrar, last year, 
just over 3 percent of students 
identified as two or more races.

A panel of University faculty 

met Monday night to discuss 
how multiracialism influences 
academic work for the first of 
their yearlong series dedicated 
to discussing the multiracial 
experience.

“We were really hoping to 

create a sense of community,” 
said 
Karen 
Downing, 
the 

University Library’s head of 
social sciences and the education 
liaison librarian. “This is a 
population that is often hidden 
because we don’t walk around 
with signs on us saying we’re 
multiracial. 
It’s 
hard 
to 

connect sometimes with other 
multiracial people.”

Downing said the organizers 

hope to share their stories and 
find some commonalities with 
one another during the course of 
this series.

“There’s 
also 
a 
growing 

multiracial population in our

country and on our campus,” 
Downing 
said. 
“There’s 

a 
growing 
need 
for 
more 

inclusive research and teaching 
pedagogies that acknowledge 
intersections 
of 
social 

identities, and there’s a growing 
pipeline of multiracial students, 
staff and faculty.”

The panel included Martha 

Jones, a professor of history 
and Afroamerican and African 
Studies and co-director of the 
Michigan Law Program in 
Race, Law and History, as well 
as Edward West, professor 
emeritus in the School of Art & 
Design, and Mark Kamimura-
Jimenez, Rackham director of 
Graduate Student Success.

All three faculty panelists 

raised 
points 
about 
the 

experiences 
of 
multiracial 

people, 
the 
diversity 
of 

multiracial students on campus 
and responded to the question, 
“What does it mean to be 
multiracial in a monoracial 
world?” Each also focused on 
an aspect specific to their own 
story, research and work at the 
University.

West, the first to speak, was 

born to an African-American 
father from Cincinnati and a 
German mother from Berlin. 

West, who grew up in New York 
City, has been a practicing artist 
since he was 17 years old and a 
teacher since he was 22, both 
professions are what he refers 
to as “central strands” of who 
he is as a person.

“Being mixed is about living 

within a very particular state of 
consciousness, and so is being 
an artist,” West said. “Being 
mixed is about seeing things, 
accessing experiences in new 
combinations, and so is being 
an artist. Whether we like it or 
not, whether we choose it or not, 
being mixed is also about being a 
teacher, about the conversations 
that always arise as we explain 
to others who we are.”

West said the interlacing 

of place, person and time has 
always been key to his work, 
as well as thinking how these 
contexts change who a person 
is, how people see themselves 
and how others see them.

West 
has 
dedicated 

more than a decade to his 
photography 
project, 
“So 

Called.” Centered primarily on 
mixed race, the project focuses 
on geography, as West explored 
many different locations to 
complete his project, including 
Honolulu and Havana, Cuba.

“So much of mixed-race 

literature and commentary had 
revolved around the pressures 
to choose one race or ethnic 

identity over the multiplicity of 
one’s true lineage,” West said. “I 
wanted (my daughter) to know 
that there were places where 
her cultural conditioning were 
the norm, not the exception. I 
wanted her to understand that 
she didn’t have to subsume one 
part of her heritage in favor 
of another. I wanted her to be 
proud of being this and that.”

According to West, to say 

mixed 
race 
or 
multiethnic 

means attempting to unpack the 
concept of race among broader 
cultural context.

“ ‘So Called’ is a modifier 

that calls out the limits of 
naming,” 
West 
said. 
“For 

this project it also calls out 
the limits of any attempt to 
quantify, qualify and delimit 
who we are as mixed people.”

Jones retold the story of how 

she began researching for a book 
about racial identity in the United 
States, particularly mixed-race 
identity. While doing research, 
Jones said she discovered aspects 
of her own identity that were 
unknown to her.

“If the generations before 

mine had kept their silence, 
preferring 
dissemblance 
to 

socially awkward disclosure, 
I was different,” Jones said. “I 
was prepared to put it out there 
and let others make of it what 
they liked.”

LAUREN BARRETT

Campus funny girl

Business 
senior 
Lauren 

Barrett is involved in an 
improv 
comedy 
group, 

Midnight 
Book 
Club, 
as 

well as Funny or Die at the 
University.

What do you do for each 

organization?

Midnight Book Club is 

a long-form improv team. 
In an MBC show, we get a 
suggestion from the audience, 
then proceed to create a 
30-minute montage of scenes 
based on that suggestion.

Funny or Die University 

of 
Michigan 
is 
a 
brand 

ambassadorship for Funny or 
Die. The goal is to unite and 
incubate comics on campus. 
I am one of the ambassadors 

alongside Ryan McDonough, 
and we put on shows, make 
sketches, have writers’ rooms 
and panels, etc.

Why business and 

comedy?

My dream is to become a 

marketer, improviser, and 
mix the two. The fear is that 
I become Michael Scott of 
sorts. The dream is that I 
don’t. I really like improv and 
sketch, and I really want to 
work with people who care 
about it at its core.

How has your experience 

at the University made that 

possible?

Stephen M. Ross is my 

comedy idol. Actually, it’s 

helped me learn to self-
start. I don’t need to wait for 
permission to make sketches 
or start an improv team; I can 
do it on my own.

What’s your favorite 
thing about being a 
University student?

The homework. I love that 

it’s constant, I can rely on it 
and no matter what I do, it’ll 
never go away. It’s like a really 
great boyfriend. This is cliché 
and college-brochure-esque, 
but I don’t think I’ll ever 
surround myself with such a 
diverse group again, in terms 
of interests and personalities.

NIGHT OF PR AYE R

Yale prof. presents on human 
ability to endure toxic materials

Speaker says 

Martinique locals 
link pesticides with 

homosexuality

By ANNA HARITOS

Daily Staff Reporter

Homosexuality 
and 

environmental toxins may be 
unexpected topical pairings for 
a research study, but Monday, 
Yale University Prof. Vanessa 
Agard-Jones 
explored 
both 

in the context of a curious 
story from the French island 
Martinique.

Faculty 
members 
and 

graduate students listened as 
Agard-Jones 
explained 
her 

research on homosexuality and 
gender transgression, both of 
which she said are frequently 
discussed topics in Martinique. 
In recent years, her research 

has shifted to include a story 
about the island’s relationship 
to 
bodily 
contamination 
by 

chlordecone, a pesticide better 
known as Kepone in the United 
States, that was once used on 
the island’s banana plantations.

Agard-Jones said the Kepone 

contamination began in 1979 
when inclement weather hit 
the island’s banana population, 
and the farmers, struggling 
to rebuild their farms, faced a 
plague of insects. Plantation 
owners insisted that the only 
answer to the issue was a 
chemical solution.

Kepone 
was 
sought 

by 
pesticide 
distributing 

companies on Martinique. It was 
historically imported from the 
United States, but after a plant 
spill in 1958, the distribution 
and production were halted and 
made illegal in the U.S. In 1981 
the companies and plantation 
owners, through political and 
economic pressure, acquired 

permission 
to 
distribute 

Kepone, and ultimately bought 
the patent to produce it. It wasn’t 
until 1990 that the French 
government stepped in to stop 
the production and distribution 
due to the increased levels 
contaminating the island.

“The body has memory,” she 

said, quoting Jamaican poet 
Claudia Rankine. “The physical 
carriage hauls more than its 
weight.”

She said the World Cancer 

Research 
Fund 
ranks 

Martinique 
as 
having 
the 

highest age-standardized rate 
of prostate cancer diagnosis 
per 100,000 people. In addition 
to the rate of cancer diagnoses, 
she said island residents believe 
there may be a connection 
between 
the 
pesticide 
and 

homosexuality 
and 
gender 

transgression.

“This issue with the pesticide 

is an occasion right now for 
people to ask questions about 
where this ‘desire’ comes from,” 
Agard-Jones said.

She said when this chemical 

breaks down in the environment, 
it produces estrogen-mimicking 
chemicals that are then ingested 
by humans and animals.

“These are compounds that 

can 
actually 
raise 
estrogen 

loads in the body,” she said. “So 
then the question that is raised 
then is what happens when 
we become more estrogenic? 
What does that do? Does that 
change our desires? Does that 
change the way that we present 
ourselves in terms of our gender 
presentation? There are no hard 
facts 
about 
what 
becoming 

estrogenic 
does 
besides 

actually emergent studies about 
estrogenic male bodies and 
their relationship to cancer.”

In 
addition 
to 
raising 

these questions, Agard-Jones 
addressed her latest project: 
a book titled “Body Burdens: 
Toxic Endurance and Decolonial 
Desire in the French Atlantic.”

“The 
book 
will 
explore 

the ways in which Caribbean

colleagues after her lecture, 
diving deeper into the socio-
political issues involved with 
the story of Martinique.

“Is it a toxic question?” 

History Prof. John Carson 
asked. “She brings up the 
question of what exactly is 
the problem? Is it a problem 
of gender identification? Is it 
a problem of physical health? 
I thought that was really 
interesting.”

Jones said one of the very 

first articles she wrote was for 
a news outlet, editors gave her 
article the title “Biracial, and 
also black.”

“It was a reflection on shifting 

categories, one that used my 
family history to tell about how 
we got from the one drop pool 
to mixed race,” Jones said. “It 
was powerful to hear people 
respond to the work. Detractors 
told me I couldn’t be both black 
and biracial.”

Jones referenced feminist 

writer and poet Helene Cixous’ 
famous line, “Blackness isn’t 
black. It is the last degree of 
reds.” For Jones, Cixous’ line 
reminded her that writing a 
family history of race is more 
than social science.

“My 
family’s 
story 
has 

banished 
the 
red, 
leaving 

blackness to stand alone, stand 
in for the whole,” Jones said.

She 
posed 
questions 
to 

attendees: “Can a color be 
remembered? Does it carry with 
it memories of red, of black, of 
white … ? What happens to my 
blackness when it becomes also 
red? Is it then blackness at all?”

Going 
through 
school, 

Kamimura-Jimenez said people 
would often ask, “What are you?” 
and after listing off different 
ethnicities, he said they would 
often call him a “mutt.”

“The only mutt I knew was 

my neighbor’s dog,” Kamimura-

Jimenez said jokingly. “You 
have these notions of attaching 
identity 
to 
these 
different 

events in your life … (As a child) 
it becomes really complicated to 
negotiate and understand the 
world we’re in.”

Kamimura-Jimenez 
said 

racial history in the United 
States informs a lot of the 
climate 
around 
mixed-race 

identities. 

When 
beginning 
his 

dissertation, 
Kamimura-

Jimenez said a faculty member 
asked him why he was studying 
race and told him to study 
something more important. 

So Kamimura-Jimenez wrote 

his dissertation on multiple 
race groups and mixed race as 
related to identity development. 
In his dissertation, he asked the 
question, “How do mixed-race 
people understand themselves 
and others?”

Kamimura-Jimenez 
found 

in his research that mixed race 
people understood others much 
more than they understood 
themselves because mixed-race 
people are constantly trying to 
negotiate 
their 
environment 

with situational identity.

“Do we create environments 

in which students are being 
forced to think about who they 
are all the time?” Kamimura-
Jimenez asked. “We need to 
create environments in which 
students can be themselves. 
They need to be free to be who 
they are.”

A multiracial student panel 

will take place in winter 2016.

the website Rate My Professors. 
Others said faculty should be 
transparent and responsive to 
student requests. Others said 
because course evaluation data is 
provided by students, it should be 
made available to students.

Those opposed to releasing 

the data pointed to potential 
bias based on race, gender, 
ethnicity 
and 
sexuality 
in 

course evaluation data, the low 
student participation rate in the 
evaluations and the professional 
implications such a release could 
have for faculty members.

On Oct. 12, Holloway said 

a prototype website featuring 
limited data has been up and 
running for several months. 
His announcement earlier this 
month was met with surprise by 
SACUA members, who voiced 
the need for broader faculty 
consultation before such a plan 
was implemented.

At the time, Comparative 

Literature 
Prof. 
Silke-Maria 

Weineck, the SACUA chair, said 
a majority of faculty members 
dislike 
the 
current 
course 

evaluation tools.

“In my 17 years at the University 

of Michigan, I have not heard from 
a single person that thinks this 
is a good instrument providing 
good data,” she said. “In sum, 
nobody thinks that these are 
good data. And whatever they are, 
they were not designed to assist 
students in choosing classes; it is 

the wrong instrument for that. 
So what we’ve been saying at the 
Senate Assembly, it’s not that we 
don’t think students don’t have a 
legitimate interest in having more 
and better information on how to 
choose classes, but we think at a 
world-class University it behooves 
us to design an instrument that can 
actually deliver the data needed 
for that purpose.”

In an interview with the Daily 

last week, University Provost 
Martha 
Pollack 
said 
if 
the 

University’s 
Senate 
Assembly 

expressed 
similar 
disapproval 

about releasing course evaluation 
data, she was willing to delay the 
release.

“This came up because the 

students have requested it — this 
was all prompted by the students. 
We then got a response from 
SACUA that they were not happy 
about it,” Pollack said. “So I’ve 
asked them to take it to Senate 
Assembly, which is a bigger body, 
and if there’s serious unhappiness 
about it there, then I’m willing to 
hold off. But then I’ve said I want 
faculty governance to meet with 
student governance to get this 
sorted out.”

Pollack acknowledged faculty 

concerns 
about 
the 
current 

evaluations during her interview 
with the Daily. As a result, she 
said she has asked Holloway 
to form a committee including 
students, faculty and assessment 
experts 
to 
determine 
best 

practices for course evaluation. If 
these best practices are not in line 
with the current instrument, the 
committee will be charged with 

recommending an alternative.

On Monday, Mika LaVaque-

Manty, a professor of political 
science, presented an abbreviated 
summary of his research on 
bias based on race, ethnicity 
and gender in course evaluation 
data. According to his findings, 
LaVaque-Manty said, there is no 
indication of such bias. To reach 
this conclusion, he aggregated 
data from the 108,000 courses 
offered 
by 
the 
College 
of 

Engineering and LSA over the 
past 10 years.

LaVaque-Manty argued in favor 

of providing students with current 
course evaluation data until a new 
instrument is developed.

“There is no evidence of bias,” 

LaVaque-Manty said. “This does 
not mean that social identity is not 
in play, but the instrument seems 
to be pretty neutral on that. The 
question of a better instrument is a 
reasonable one, but at the moment 
students are using nothing for 
most of us, or RateMyProfessors.
com for about 10 percent of us. The 
current instrument has shown to 
be much more consistent, a much 
better instrument. I don’t see any 
inconsistency between the idea of 
developing a better instrument and 
at the same time releasing data.”

Angela 
Dillard, 
the 
LSA 

associate dean for undergraduate 
education and a professor of 
Afroamerican 
and 
African 

Studies, said faculty should focus 
on whether or not to release course 
evaluation 
data, 
rather 
than 

developing a new instrument.

“This is not a new conversation; 

we’ve been looking at this for a 

long time,” Dillard said. “I am 
unconvinced that a study group 
could come up with a somehow 
better instrument that would be 
free from the questions we’re 
using now. I don’t think that this 
committee is going to come up 
with something that is somehow 
magically better. For me, it’s a 
question of release it or don’t 
release it. I can’t tell you how 
many studies we’ve done; I think 
that that’s just evasive.”

Several student government 

representatives were also present 
at the meeting. LSA senior 
Cooper Charlton, Central Student 
Government president, said CSG 
is in favor of working with faculty 
to develop a new instrument. 
In the meantime, however, the 
group plans to advocate for 
current course evaluation data 
to be released at the start of the 
winter 2016 semester.

“We 
want 
this 
to 
be 
a 

collaborative 
effort,” 
Charlton 

said. “By no means are we here to 
shove your concerns into a corner 
and not listen to you. That being 
said, it’s a decision, ‘are we going to 
release these now or are we going 
to kick the can down the road?’ 
We see there’s two conversations 
going on: the immediate release of 
course evaluations as they stand, 
and the second conversation is how 
can we come together through 
the committee Dr. Holloway has 
suggested to determine what 
the instrument looks like going 
forward?”

In an interview after the 

meeting, 
LSA 
senior 
Jason 

Colella, president of LSA Student 

Government, said he was willing 
to accept a delayed release of 
course evaluation data if it meant 
protecting 
the 
relationship 

between students and faculty.

“Personally, I would want the 

immediate release as well, but 
I am willing to take a step back 
and wait until we can get further 
agreement,” he said. “In my 
opinion, it’s not worth causing 
such strife amongst faculty in 
order to get the release of data.”

Following 
the 
meeting, 

Charlton stressed that CSG has 
a vested interest in collaborating 
with faculty.

“From the outside, it looks 

like it’s faculty versus students — 
and it’s really not that,” Charlton 
said. “I really do believe it is 
faculty and students wanting to 
work together. I want that to be 
extremely clear, we want to work 
with faculty. That being said, we 
want the course evaluations to be 
released for winter 2016.”

For this to happen, Charlton 

said, CSG has developed two 
potential options.

“We have two congruent plans 

that we can take, one is a little bit 
more aggressive that we want to 
avoid because, like I said, we want 
to commit to a relationship with 
faculty, not just while I’m here, 
but down the road,” he said. “We 
have a softer plan that involves a 
lot of sit-down meetings, but that 
probably won’t work, so we’re 
really left with one aggressive 
plan. We’d like to avoid taking an 
aggressive stance on this, but it’s 
something we might have to do.”

Western Michigan 
student found 
dead in Norway

Western Michigan University 

senior Dallas Rauker was found 
dead Sunday morning on the 
Reinebringen 
mountain 
in 

Norway, the Detroit Free Press 
reported.

Rauker 
was 
attending 

Hogeschool 
Utrecht 
in 
the 

Netherlands in a study abroad 
program 
with 
Western 

Michigan’s Institute for Global 
Education. Rauker was spending 
his fall break last week hiking in 
Norway, when his family became 
concerned after not hearing 
from him during the middle of 
the week.

After his family contacted 

WMU, Utrecht officials were 
contacted and worked with the 
U.S. Embassy to pinpoint the area 
in Norway where Rauker was 
hiking. Officials searched Friday 
through Sunday and were often 
stopped by inclement weather, 
eventually finding Rauker on 
Sunday. Rauker’s family flew to 
Amsterdam Saturday.

Detroit mayor 
announces land 
transfer for farming

Detroit Mayor Mike Dug-

gan announced a deal to trans-
fer 40-acres of Detroit-owned 
land near Eastern Market to 
the RecoveryPark project, the 
Detroit Free Press reported.

RecoveryPark is a project 

aimed to commercially grow 
food inside the city. The prof-
its will support SHAR, a drug 
addiction recovery center.

To begin, RecoveryPark will 

build 
plastic-wrapped 
hoop 

houses to grow vegetables year-
round. In coming years, the 
program hopes to build more 
permanent growing sheds.

The program already grows 

vegetables at a former industrial 
area and sells the salad greens to 
approximately 15 Detroit restau-
rants.

This deal will eventually start 

as a lease between RecoveryPark 
and the city, eventually leading 
to a full purchase of the land.

The land transfer is expected 

to go before City Council next 
week.

new scholarship programs and 
an move to package financial 
aid packages with admissions 
decisions.

This year, the percentage of 

total Black students on campus is 
at 4.82 percent, or an increase of 
59 students since last year.

Kinesiology senior Capri’Nara 

Kendall, speaker of the BSU, 
said increased number of Black 
students 
in 
class 
represents 

a positive trend, though she 
added that the University still 
has a way to go in terms of 
tangibly increasing diversity and 
subsequently improving student 
life for Black students on campus.

“Talk to me when minority 

enrollment is out of the 4 percent 
— when we’re looking at more 
of a 7-percent enrollment for 
African Americans,” she said in 
an interview with The Michigan 
Daily. “When we’re looking at 
more of a 7-percent enrollment 
for Latino students.”

Similarly, 
the 
number 
of 

undergraduate Hispanic students 
at the University also saw a slight 
bump in the last year, from 
1,209 undergraduate students 
in the fall 2014 semester to 
1,300 students as of this current 
semester. 
Hispanic 
students 

currently make up 4.93 percent 
of the undergraduate body and 
5.9 percent of the incoming 
freshman class.

Note that the University’s 

enrollment report employs the 
term “Hispanic,” whereas most 
students tend to use, generally, 
the 
term 
“Latin 
American.” 

Though 
the 
University 
has 

increased diversity among its 
Latin American students, some 
student leaders say more efforts 
are needed on campus.

LSA senior Thalia Maya, the 

president 
of 
the 
historically 

Latina Lambda Theta Alpha 
sorority, noted that some of the 
reason for the increase in Latina 
students on campus is due to the 
increasing accessibility of higher 
education to these communities. 
She said many Latin American 
students, like herself, are born to 
immigrant parents and are the 
first in their families to attend 
college. This, she added, can pose 
a challenge.

“When I first came here, I 

was living in the dorms and 
surrounded by people who did 
not look like me at all,” Maya 
said. “That did make me feel 
uncomfortable, but being able 
to find people who came from 
similar 
backgrounds 
as 
me 

served as that support system.”

For Native American students, 

though increases in diversity 

have occurred, they have been 
slight. In the entire student body, 
there was an increase of only 12 
new Native American students 
from last fall’s enrollment. This 
marked a percentage bump from 
0.21 percent of the student body 
to 0.25 percent.

Public 
Policy 
senior 
Isa 

Gaillard, co-chair of the Native 
American Student Association, 
said 
the 
slight 
increase 
of 

representation 
for 
Native 

American students is a “drop in a 
bucket.”

Gaillard says NASA, originally 

designed 
as 
a 
group 
for 

undergraduate Native American 
students, has been struggling 
with 
retaining 
and 
growing 

its membership. This year, he 
said, only eight or nine students 
come to meetings — and they 
are a mix of both graduate and 
undergraduate students.

“We 
e-mailed 
all 
of 
the 

students that are listed as Native 
and none of them showed up to 
our meeting,” he said.

He attributes the decreased 

NASA membership to the general 
lack of Native American students 
on campus.

Gaillard 
and 
other 
NASA 

members work each year to raise 
awareness for Native American 
culture through hosting the 
Native American Heritage Month 
in November, alongside the Office 

for Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs.

NASA 
also 
organizes 
an 

annual “powwow,” or cultural 
celebration with food, dancers, 
drummers 
and 
fashion. 

According 
to 
Gaillard, 
the 

University’s 
powwow 
is 
the 

second 
largest 
student-run 

powwow in the nation. The 2014 
iteration, the 42nd Dance for 
Mother Earth Powwow, was held 
at Skyline High School.

Despite NASA’s efforts to 

promote awareness of Native 
American culture on campus, 
Gaillard says when he asks, many 
students are unaware of the 
heritage month or the powwow. 
Gaillard says he wants to leave 
the University knowing there 
is a more representative and 
supportive community for Native 
American students on campus, 
which starts with increasing 
their representation within the 
student body.

“We really do want to work 

with the University in whatever 
ways we can to make sure that 
not only is Native American 
student enrollment increasing, 
but also that the community feels 
welcome on campus,” he said.

Though the proportion of 

Asian American students has 
declined slightly in the new 
freshman class — changing from 
15.28 percent in 2014 to 14.09 
percent this year — the University 

does 
not 
consider 
Asian 

American students to comprise 
an “underrepresented” minority 
group. The U.S. Census Bureau 
reports Asian Americans make up 
only 2.9 percent of the Michigan 
population but represent a much 
larger proportion of students.

Still, LSA junior Eman Hijab, 

president of Michigan Pakistanis, 
or MPak, said she and other Asian 
American students are subject 
to stereotyping and judgment 
despite being represented on 
campus. Furthermore, though 
Asian 
American 
students 

make up 11.87 percent of all 
undergraduate students, she said 
intra-Asian American groups, 
like 
South 
Asian, 
Southeast 

Asian, East Asian and Middle 
Eastern students have much 
smaller representations.

For this reason, Hijab said in 

an e-mail to the Daily, she hopes 
to see increases in all minority 
groups in the coming years.

“I can’t help but to think about 

how many potential connections, 
friendships, relationships, were 
forewent due to the decrease in 
theses enrollment numbers this 
year alone and how many will 
be foregone in the future years 
if enrollment doesn’t increase to 
include not just Asian Americans 
but other minorities as well,” she 
wrote.

been pretty unbelievable the 
past 100 days, and just to see it 
all in one event has been pretty 
unbelievable as well. It’s hard to 
express what this all means to 
me. I love everyone that’s here.”

Johnson 
said 
Janssen’s 

recovery has been going well for 
an injury this serious.

“Normally the diagnosis is 

full paralysis below the chest; 
however, 
Taylor 
has 
been 

showing tricep control and has 
been doing really, really well in 
his rehab and showing a lot of 
strength,” Johnson said. “He’s 
an incredibly motivated kid and 
incredibly positive.”

Johnson started a GoFundMe 

campaign that raised more than 
$150,000 in the first month and 
has helped sell T-shirts and 
wristbands with a “Janssen 
Strong” brand. As of Monday 
evening, the campaign has raised 
$157,947.

“Following the accident, all 

of my friends in the fraternity 
started coming up with ideas for 
how we could help him and his 
family get through this,” he said. 
“It’s been amazing.”

The idea for the night of prayer 

originally came from Pastor 
Jim Mong of the Redeemer Ann 
Arbor church. Mong said he was 
inspired by the story and wanted 
to help show support in the 
community.

“I went to visit Taylor two 

weeks after his accident, and they 
talked about how overwhelmed 
they were with how much 
support they’d been getting from 
the community,” Mong said. “As 
I walked away, I hoped that as 
he had that long-term journey 
that he would have that support 
long term, so I met with Seth and 
had the idea of doing it 100 days 
out to show that the support will 
continue.”

Looking 
forward, 
Johnson 

said he hopes Janssen continues 
to recover and is still able to live 
a fulfilling life.

“My hope for him, in the 

future, is that this doesn’t 

impede his ability to do whatever 
he wants,” he said. “He always 
wanted to be a CFO, and I hope 
he can obtain whatever he wants 
in his career regardless of this 
injury.”

At the event, Janssen’s father, 

Mark Janssen, spoke about his 
the family’s experiences during 
the past 100 days of recovery.

“Early on, we saw an amazing 

difference,” he said. “He has a 
ton of strength back — nowhere 
near where he was — but he has a 
ton of strength back.”

He also took time to thank 

all 
the 
people 
who 
have 

been 
supporting 
his 
family 

throughout the entire process, 
particularly 
the 
Greek 
life 

community. 
Janssen 
said 

despite his past experience in 
a fraternity himself, he did not 
truly understand its importance 
until now.

“I never got it, really, but 

I truly get it now,” he said. “I 
wanted to close with a big thank 
you to the Greek system. You’ve 
given such tremendous support, 
and it truly humbles me.”

I

t’s a law of physics that, in liquid, the denser 
object sinks lower. But this particular rule 
doesn’t hold true in the building of cities. 

Density doesn’t sink a com-
munity — sprawl does.

That’s because population 

density makes sense. And it’s 
the kind of sense that can 
be measured in taxpayer 
dollars saved, an economy 
diversified and a city made 
greener. Sustainable cit-
ies are the building blocks 
of a sustainable nation, 
one that can survive in a 
changing world.

There’s a saying that goes 

something like, “God was 
good enough to give man the beauty of the 
world, but cruel enough to give him the drive 
to destroy it.”

Since 1981, the amount of farmable land in the 

United States has dropped from about 20 to 16 
percent of our total land area. While a drop of 4 
percent may seem like a small change, it repre-
sents a loss of over 141,000 square miles of arable 
land. That’s nearly the entire state of Montana.

I don’t write this to preach Armageddon, but 

rather to check a reality that we so easily take for 
granted. And land is a fleeting reality.

Concentrating population centers saves natu-

ral beauty and farmland. But more than that, 
dense cities greatly reduce our dependence on 
the automobile. A dependence that is responsible 
for nearly one-fifth of all carbon emissions in the 
United States.

The stark reality is our current mode of life 

is not sustainable. Our generation will be faced 
with many existential crises. Survival in our 
changing environment will be the most critical.

Now I’m hesitant to speak in generalizations 

about our generation. The media loves to pigeon-
hole Millennials as one of only a handful of 
things. But as the largest generation ever, diver-
sity of thought is inevitable. That said, three of 
the things the media tells us we are, I like.

First, we seek out cities. Second, we are eco-

nomically enterprising. And third, we try to be 
socially conscientious. This is the segment of 
Millennials that every city wants and Ann 
Arbor needs. And, you guessed it, urban den-
sity can help.

Ann Arbor needs a next generation of resi-

dents, one that will respect and uphold our 
remarkable values. As of 2010, people ages 20 to 
24 make up more than 20 percent of Ann Arbor’s 
population. If we bump up one age bracket, to 
people ages 25 to 29, that number halves. It make 
sense. After all, we are a college town and people 
graduate. But how do we retain more of that 20 

percent come commencement day?

When a city builds out, it cuts off its abil-

ity to create vibrant cultural and economic 
centers or provide meaningful transit options. 
Both elements are essential to our generation, 
a whopping 86 percent of whom say that public 
transportation is critical. When we single out 
Millennials making less than $30,000 a year, 
that statistic jumps to 92 percent. This sug-
gests that affordability is also imperative to 
the Millennial equation.

Ann Arbor has one of the hottest real estate 

markets in the country, with an average rental 
room that costs a startling $1,118 per month. 
There is clearly a huge demand for housing that is 
not being met by supply. Denser housing develop-
ment provides more housing options with direct 
access to awesome amenities, like a vibrant 
downtown and public transit.

All that said, creating an affordable city 

does more than allow young residents to pay 
rent. It speaks to an inner drive to live in a 
truly diverse community, not one sanitized by 
forces of gentrification.

But Ann Arbor is still a rich community. With 

the average price of a house hanging out north of 
$300,000, it’s not uncommon for residents to be 
paying $7,000 or more a year in property taxes. It 
may be startling, then, that the city isn’t in great 
fiscal shape — every year, our costs are rising 
faster than our revenue. That’s a scary place to 
be. Luckily, density can help.

The logic is pretty simple. Infrastructure costs 

a lot of money. And suburban living requires a lot 
of infrastructure. Just think about how much all 
those winding roads must cost, not to mention 
the pipes that run beneath. In fact, the marginal 
cost of providing services to a new building is so 
high that a dense, multi-use development costs 
society between 38 and 50 percent less than a 
single-family home.

Your local government isn’t just saving money, 

though. It’s also tapping new revenue streams. 
New neighbors mean everyone’s services keep 
coming, but new taxes don’t need to.

Of course, all of this means change. But change 

is inevitable, and when it comes to sustainability 
and survival, change is necessary.

The desires of youth will likely shape the 

future. But those desires must be refined by the 
moderation and historical perspective of older 
generations. For that reason, density can’t just 
mean skyscrapers and subways; often it will sim-
ply mean townhouses and duplexes. Like every 
generation that has preceded us, we will reshape 
our nation. I hope ours will reshape densely.

T

his past weekend, the Mar-
tha Cook Building, one of the 
University’s three remain-

ing 
all-female 

dorms, 
cele-

brated its 100th 
anniversary. 
Both current and 
former residents 
attended 
the 

event, and Uni-
versity President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

gave a keynote 
speech that laud-
ed the building’s 
“unique learning 
environment, where everyone feels 
equally included.”

The educational experience for 

women at the University has cer-
tainly evolved in the 100 years since 
Martha Cook opened. Though it’s 
not obvious that all-women housing 
fills the same niche in the campus 
community that it once did, female 
dorms continue to provide a sup-
portive community for residents.

When 
the 
University 
began 

admitting female students in 1870, 
the co-education of women and 
men was exceedingly controversial. 
Though ultimately successful and 
enduring, co-education challenged 
not only classroom dynamics, but 
also every aspect of the educational 
structure. Housing female students 
became a special concern.

Prior to construction of the first 

all-women residence halls, female 
students typically lived in boarding 
houses independent from the Uni-
versity, or on occasion, in the homes 
of University faculty members. The 
first all-women residence halls 
— the Martha Cook Building and 
Helen Newberry Residence — rep-

resented the first major efforts by 
the University to house female stu-
dents. A 1924 survey of all female 
alumni evidences that the buildings 
benefited residents by providing a 
sense of solidarity and belonging 
 

on campus.

But since the 1970s, women across 

the United States have been attend-
ing college at higher rates than their 
male counterparts, and men out-
numbered women by only 1 percent 
in the University’s entering under-
graduate class in 2015. Accommo-
dating female students on campus is 
no longer a special concern for those 
charged with planning and pro-
viding student housing — it’s lit-
erally half of the students they’re 
dealing with.

Today, most on-campus hous-

ing is co-ed, and fewer than 400 
women live in one of the three all-
female residence halls. That trend 
doesn’t seem likely to reverse any-
time soon, as co-ed housing has 
become increasingly common on 
campuses nationwide.

Based on recent trends in student 

housing, it may seem that all-female 
residence halls might be little more 
than relics of the past, and lack sig-
nificant roles to play on campus. But, 
even today, many residents find that 
their time in all-female housing adds 
significant value to their University 
experience — at least I did.

I lived in the Martha Cook Build-

ing during my freshman and soph-
omore years. On the surface, I’m 
not the first person anyone would 
expect to live there. Across cam-
pus, the building’s culture seems to 
be typified as old-fashioned, ultra-
conservative and unsocial. But 
far from being backward or overly 
traditional, the building’s culture 

emphasizes personal and academic 
achievement, and fosters a commu-
nity of students dedicated to help-
ing each other succeed.

In my experience, all-female 

housing fosters an educational envi-
ronment unparalleled anywhere on 
campus. I have never lived in a more 
studious, 
focused 
environment. 

Residents were more than willing 
to help each other understand class 
materials, and because many women 
choose to live in the building multi-
ple years, older students were often 
around to help freshmen adjust to 
classes and campus life. The atmo-
sphere was in equal parts supportive 
and serious.

Ostensibly, there’s no reason 

why co-ed on-campus housing 
couldn’t be restructured to provide 
similar academic support. Even so, 
all-women housing is unique in its 
ability to support female students. 
Fostering a community of women 
dedicated to helping each other 
achieve personal and academic 
goals is in itself beneficial. Though 
women and men attend the Uni-
versity in almost equal numbers, 
women still face obstacles on cam-
pus that their male counterparts 
don’t. For the women who choose 
to live there, all-female hous-
ing can provide a support system 
that can help residents overcome 
 

common barriers.

In that respect, the Martha Cook 

Building still serves the same func-
tion that it did 100 years ago. Far 
from being outmoded and outdated, 
all-women housing provides tangible 
benefits for its residents by fostering 
a supportive campus community.

ZACHARY 
ACKERMAN

Where is the line?

Halloween, 
or 
“Hallo-week,” 

as it’s celebrated in Greek life, is a 
seven-day romp in costume, a time 
when otherwise sane students step 
out as TV characters, tabloid anti-
heroes, celebrities of the moment 
and perennial favorites like the 
sexy kitten. As the ever-popular 
cat ears vanish from store shelves 
this week and many of us look for-
ward to our first experience of this 
curious exhibition, it is time to talk 
about which kinds of costumes 
should be showcased in this year’s 
festivities and which should not.

As the “liaison” for my sorority 

to the Panhellenic executive board, 
also known as a junior Panhel-
lenic representative, I have had the 
opportunity, with approximately 
30 other girls, to get an insider’s 
look at these issues. For the past 
two meetings, we have been dis-
cussing 
cultural 
appropriation, 

trying to anticipate and help to pre-
empt the offensive language, cos-
tumes and behaviors that have too 
often stained Greek life — and, let’s 
be honest, American life.

After just one of these sessions, 

I was appalled, not only because I 
had now been aptly made aware of 
how pervasive instances of cultural 
insensitivity are, but also because it 
made me realize just how easy it is 
to perpetuate this behavior.

Cultural appropriation is when a 

privileged group adopts a cultural 
symbol, norm or behavior and takes 
it for itself because it’s considered 
funny, fashionable or cool. Kidada 
Malloy, our discussion facilitator 
and the Expect Respect program 

assistant, said during her presenta-
tion and later reiterated in an inter-
view that cultural appropriation 
is offensive because “it belittles a 
culture or identity, in a way that 
trivializes an entire way of life.” 
An outrageous example of this was 
popularized in 2012 when sorority 
girls from Penn State University 
wore sombreros and held signs say-
ing, “I don’t cut grass, I smoke it,” 
and “will mow lawn for weed and 
beer.” It goes without saying that 
these girls crossed the line, but 
where is it drawn?

Malloy made it clear in her pre-

sentation that there is no line. It’s 
impossible to know if you’re offend-
ing someone without asking, so you 
should simply err on the side of cau-
tion. She said something as small 
as wearing a bindi as an accessory, 
without acknowledging its historic 
and cultural representation, is like-
ly to offend someone. 

During the meeting, we pre-

dominantly 
discussed 
the 
role 

of celebrity influence in cultural 
appropriation. Last year, Pharrell 
Williams was showcased on the 
cover of Elle magazine sporting a 
Native American headdress. Selena 
Gomez performed “Come and Get 
it” at the 2013 MTV awards dressed 
in a sari, saying later that it was 
“fun” to incorporate the culture 
into the performance. Katy Perry 
also performed her song “Uncon-
ditionally” 
wearing 
a 
kimono, 

dressed as a geisha. In two of these 
three cases, the artists apologized 
almost immediately for their disre-
spect toward an entire culture.

Malloy deemed it essential to 

recognize that cultural appro-
priation primarily happens when 
people are unaware of how their 
actions may be perceived as offen-
sive. Malloy urged us to “engage in 
conversations with our peer com-
munity to expand our awareness 
and understanding of different cul-
tures so that our actions match up 
with our values.”

In practice, there’s no difference 

between being outwardly offen-
sive, like those who participated in 
the infamous “Bloods and Crips” 
theme party at Dartmouth College 
versus simply wearing a bindi as a 
body jewel at your next party. In 
both cases, you’re offending some-
one, and although the degree might 
differ, we shouldn’t be inappropri-
ately or inaccurately portraying a 
way of life.

One of the more prevalent occur-

rences of cultural appropriation 
stems from sexualizing minori-
ties, which is something to keep 
in mind when trying to scandalize 
your costume this year. Try opting 
for a sexy animal or a sexy mythi-
cal creature this time around. Trust 
me, you’d be hard pressed to find a 
racy dragon-fairy that feels dis-
criminated against, and you won’t 
be perpetuating disrespectful ste-
reotypes in the process.

With that being said, for this 

Halloween, let’s foster an inclusive 
and welcoming environment by 
opting to wear actual costumes and 
not cultures.

interview with longtime friend 
Foxman 
showcases 
signature 

Barrymore 
— 
unapologetic, 

unedited and exceedingly wise 
— covering everything from 
her family goldfish’s feeding 
schedule to the specifics of her 
latest film, “Miss You Already,” 
which premiered during the 
Toronto 
International 
Film 

Festival 
this 
September. 
As 

Foxman continues to praise 
her 
remarkable, 
persisting 

likability, Barrymore modestly 
withholds any self-praise. She 
simply admits her lifelong goal 
of being everyone’s cheerleader, 
a quality she saw best embodied 
in Norm from “Cheers.” Ever 
the 
optimist, 
Barrymore 

regards her past with reverence, 
maintaining 
the 
invaluable 

learning 
experiences 
derived 

from missteps, a key concept of 
her new autobiography.

In collaboration with Nicola’s 

Books, The Michigan Theater 
is hosting the only Michigan 
stop of her “Wildflower” book 
tour. 
During 
Wednesday’s 

“An 
Evening 
with 
Drew 

Barrymore,” the actress is set 
to speak about her work, read 
excerpts from the memoir and 
answer questions from the 
moderator, 
theater 
director 

of sponsorship Drew Waller. 
Guests can submit questions 
upon entry to the show. Each 
ticket purchase includes a copy 
of the memoir, released Oct. 
27, which Barrymore can sign 
following the presentation.

“I think it’s a really great 

chance to see someone we know 
as an actress,” said Ruth Lednicer, 
the theater’s senior director of 
marketing and programs.

Barrymore’s 
directorial 

debut “Whip It” — the roller 
derby-dramedy starring Ellen 
Page, filmed throughout the 
Metro Detroit area. Though her 
repertoire continues to expand, 

today, Barrymore dabbles in all 
facets of filmmaking from acting 
to producing.

“She’s 
pretty 
multifaceted 

and a very talented woman,” 
Lednicer said. “She’s lived a 
very intense life in 40 years, and 
has some really nice insights to 
what’s important in life.”

Lednicer 
received 
a 
pre-

release copy of the memoir, and 
was apt to share a synopsis.

“Her 
book 
is 
really 
her 

various life stories — growing 
up in the crazy world she grew 
up in and how having her 
daughters helped her solidify 
her life and calm her and center 
her world,” Lednicer said. “Her 
mother was a single mother 
that raised her with the idea 
that she should do whatever she 
wanted to do. Sadly, her mother 
ended up checking her into a 
rehab center at the age of 12, but 
Drew said that’s the best thing 
that could’ve happened to her 
because it taught her respect and 
gratitude and grounded her.”

‘Ghost Dimension’ 
can’t even be OK

By BRIAN BURLAGE

Daily Arts Writer

There’s a pretty substantial 

trap that most modern hor-
ror movies fall into these days, 
and I’d like to 
spend 
some 

time 
explain-

ing it to you 
— not because 
it’s 
confusing 

or elusive, but 
because 
it’s 

worth 
talking 

about. 

“Paranormal 

Activity: 
The 

Ghost 
Dimen-

sion” proves to 
be an excellent 
case study. As 
the alleged final 
installment 
to 

a highly suc-
cessful (and some would argue 
influential) 
franchise, 
“Ghost 

Dimension” had its work cut 
out. With a strong, well-devel-
oped backstory involving a rela-
tively likeable family, with its 
cinematographic style already 
established, with a history of 
box-office brawn and boom — all 
“Ghost Dimension” had to do was 
simply glide by. It just needed to 
be OK. It failed at even that.

This brings us to the trap, 

which dulls the latest “Para-
normal 
Activity” 
film 
like 

an ugly dose of NyQuil. I’m 
going to walk you through it. 
Are you ready? Paying atten-
tion? Keep your eyes poised 
on the screen, on these words 
because it’s about to get very 
GGGGRRRAWAWAWRRRRRR.

Did that scare you? Did you 

jump? Because that’s it, that’s the 
whole trap: the jump scare.

For various reasons — weak 

stories, boring characters, poor 
style choices, inexperience — more 
and more horror movies resort to 
the jump scare for a good pump 
of adrenaline. Instead of relying 
on the natural suspense of a scene 
that’s been building because of its 
well-positioned place in the story, 
some horror movies rely on the 
cheap effect of surprise: not the 
respectable twist-inspired kind of 
alarm, but the annoying dumbed-
down version of shock. “Ghost 
Dimension” does this again and 
again.

What makes this especially 

difficult to come to terms with is 
the fact that the film didn’t have 
to rely on jump scares. The first 
three “Paranormal Activity” mov-
ies were all good and inventive 
to some degree, and though the 
franchise has certainly been slip-
ping since then, it has a reliable 
formula to fall back on: tricks with 
mounted cameras, eerie sequences 
without music, kids terrorized 
by malevolent spirits, creepy and 
mysterious rituals, you know the 
drill. “Ghost Dimension” gives a 
middle finger to all of these.

And then there’s the plot. I’ll 

do it justice with one sentence. A 
cult demon named Toby preys on a 
suburban family, latches onto one 
of the younger girls and uses her to 
breach a ghostly portal and travel 
back in time to terrorize the fam-
ily. Eighty-eight minutes do noth-
ing to make this mundane plotline 
more compelling or intelligible. 

While I try to bring this 

review to a conclusion (hope-
fully with more success than the 
franchise), I’m struck by some-
thing I hadn’t considered until 
now. “Ghost Dimension,” like its 
predecessors, spends a great deal 
of time focusing on static, empty 
places. The mounted cameras 
show empty halls, staircases and 
bedrooms for minutes at a time. 
This is where the true horror and 
fear of the movie resides: in the 
deliberate vacancy — the promise 
of emptiness.

COURTESY OF LITTLE BRUTES

Looks more like Little Milds.
Little Brutes rising 
with unique sound

By CATHERINE BAKER

Daily Arts Writer

It’s just past 11:00 on a Fri-

day night and I’m one of the 
lone survivors in the Fish-
bowl. I’ve reached a point 
where there’s something deep-
ly satisfying about outlasting 
the guy at the computer next 
to me. Or maybe it’s terribly 
sad that this is what brings 
me joy today. The low hum of 
the printers, the clatter of the 
keyboard and the occasional 
cough from across the room 
make for soothing background 
noise. I can’t help but think 
that someone infinitely more 
talented than myself would be 
able to make something beau-
tiful from such simple sounds.

While I may not be able 

to take a series of snaps and 
claps and transform it into a 
chart-topper, my most recent 
obsession, Little Brutes, does 
just that. The LA-based pop 
duo works miracles with what 
sounds like a minimal amount 
of 
instruments. 
Members 

Rachael Cantu and Harlan 
Silverman met while touring 
with B.B. King and began 
collaborating in their dressing 
room 
before 
shows. 
Their 

debut EP Desire combines airy 
melodies with strategic vocals 
to produce a live band sound 

despite the computer screen 
and headphones that separates 
them from the listener.

Exploring themes of lost 

time, 
endless 
future 
and 

persistent 
progress, 
Little 

Brutes 
creates 
a 
feeling 

that 
mixes 
nostalgia 
and 

excitement. Producing songs 
with fixed beats that resemble 
ocean swells and steady rain 
patter, Desire can easily make 
the jump from Fishbowl to 
front porch (though perhaps 
not with this cold weather 
rolling in).

Opening with “Make Our 

Own Way,” Little Brutes tells 
a tale of self-acceptance and 
adventure with lyrics that 
claim, “All we need is a roof 
and a warm place.” Repetitive 
guitar riffs and harmonies that 
make your spine tingle dictate 
the 
track, 
constructing 
a 

sound that pushes you to seize 
the moment and live in the 
present. The background noise 
is filled with eccentric items, 
like salt and pepper shakers 
or the ring of a cowbell, which 
emphasizes 
Little 
Brutes’s 

unique sound and innovative 
structure.

The title track, “Desire,” 

speaks of broken relationships 
and picking up the pieces, 
comforting 
listeners 
with 

lyrics 
like 
“Someone 
said 

to me / You’re where you 
should be.” (Unrelated, but 
applicable: These lyrics are 
particularly consoling during 
the lovely time of midterms.) 
Claps, 
snaps 
and 
hands 

create the bulk of the noise in 
“Desire,” embodying an almost 
polyphonic tone. It’s a song 
reminiscent of dark, highway 
drives and the changing of the 
seasons.

All 
the 
songs 
are 

characterized 
as 
light 

electronica 
and 
are 
lyric-

focused with a driving bass 
throughout, 
but 
“Wait 
for 

Me” takes electronic to the 
next level. Synthetic, slow 
and sensuous, “Wait for Me” 
speaks to the transitive nature 
of time, musing “If this world 
is not as it seems / Wait for 
me.” A mélange of instruments 
works together to fashion a 
single sound perfect for those 
late night contemplations.

Little 
Brutes 
could 

make music with whatever 
instruments, kitchen utensils 
or people they were given, 
which in my book makes them 
true artists. They may not be 
on the Top 100, nor should 
they aspire to be. If they keep 
making music that they love, 
they’ll attract listeners who 
love it too. (Salt and pepper 
shakers and all.)

Keep your eyes on 

these words, because 
it’s about to get very

BOOK REVIEW
‘Purity’ is pretty 
good, not genius

By DREW MARON

Daily Arts Writer

If Jonathan Franzen’s previ-

ous novel, “Freedom,” was a gen-
tly prodding critique of liberal 
activism, 
his 

latest 
book, 

“Purity,” is an 
outright com-
plaint. Despite 
his 
conten-

tious 
public 

image, 
Fran-

zen can still 
spin a hell of a 
tale.

We follow the titular char-

acter, Purity “Pip” Tyler, as 
she seeks the identity of her 
estranged father, which leads her 
to the WikiLeaks-like Sunlight 
Project and its enigmatic found-
er, Andreas Wolf.

It really isn’t until we meet 

Wolf that the novel picks up, 
with Mr. Franzen delivering one 
of his most memorable creations 
to date. Wolf is part-Mephistoph-
eles, part-Julian Assange and 
part-Hamlet. While such a com-
bination might be ridiculous if 
treated seriously, Franzen makes 
the intelligent move and plays 
up the absurdity of such an indi-
vidual, without losing the pathos 
and intricate biographical detail 
for which he is known.

Unfortunately, despite being 

the titular character, Pip is rel-
egated to the background when 
compared to Andreas and her 
investigative journalist father 
Tom. Consequently, the novel 
might disappoint readers who 
hope Franzen spent the past couple 
of years working over his anxieties 
about the opposite sex instead of 
simply enabling them through his 
fiction. For the most part, it could 
be argued that this decision trans-
lates into his admittedly unique lit-
erary style. However, it’s also what 
holds “Purity” back from being an 
exceptional work of literature.

One of the key points where 

“Purity” misses the mark is its 
depiction of Anabel, Pip’s eccentri-
cally feminist mother and Tom’s 
ex-wife. It’s a shame that in a 
novel with such engrossing char-
acters like Pip, Tom, Colleen 
and Andreas, a character as sig-
nificant to the story as Anabel is 
reduced to a “crazy feminist” cli-
ché instead of a multidimension-
al human being. The novel lacks 
the attention to her character 
and history that would allow us 
to understand how she became 
who she is. Anabel knowingly 
lies to her daughter about the 
girl’s father and, in the face of 
financial calamity, denies her 
existence as a billionaire heiress. 
The reasons and rationales that 
would drive a character to do 
these things could be fascinating 

— had they been explored. How-
ever, we never get inside Anabel’s 
head or understand why she has 
put her daughter in such difficult 
situations for largely selfish rea-
sons. We’re left with an utter lack 
of “why” in regards to her char-
acter, and, as a result, the book 
ineluctably suffers.

Yet, “Purity” is still worth 

readers’ time. While the book’s 
length 
might 
test 
readers’ 

patience, Franzen’s non-linear 
plotting brings a certain level of 
suspense rarely seen in literary 
fiction. It’s not quite as genre-
bending of Franzen’s contem-
poraries, but it still provides a 
welcome example of the author’s 
interest in connecting meaning-
fully with the culture at large.

Franzen’s public image often, 

perhaps unfairly, overshadows 
the work he produces. Most who 
haven’t read him might just see 
a pretentious-looking man who 
dissed Oprah and hates Twitter. 
His image, however, doesn’t do 
justice to the time, attention and 
work that goes into every sen-
tence of his novels. In the end, 
Franzen proves with “Purity” 
that his humor, dialogue and 
skillful 
characterization 
still 

provide rewarding experiences 
for anyone seeking time with 
interesting, engaging, opinion-
ated human beings — both real 
and imagined.

TV NOTEBOOK
‘SNL’ is not mine

It’s weird to feel 

nostalgic for 

something before 

your time

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

Over the summer, I went with 

a friend to see Saturday Night 
Live: The Exhibition, which 
boasted “40 Years of Saturday 
Nights.”

We were welcomed by a slide-

show narrated by Alec Bald-
win, who gave a brief history of 
how “SNL” started and took off 
immediately, giving the Ameri-
can public something they want-
ed — something that pushed 
boundaries and injected humor 
into situations that didn’t always 
feel funny in real life. It was 
satirical, never afraid to skewer 
those in the public eye. It was 
pop culture with an unflinch-
ing spotlight on politics. It was 
fresh; it was funny; it was multi-
faceted — and people loved it.

After the slideshow, we were 

invited to walk down a red car-
pet into Studio 8H, where the 
exhibit was organized by the 
days of the week, chronicling 
the process of making an epi-
sode and putting on a live show. 
There were original scripts and 
props and entire sets recreated. 
There were screens where Seth 
Meyers, Jimmy Fallon, Aidy 
Bryant and Cecily Strong each 
explained how “SNL” pieces 
came together. Some things 
we could touch and some we 
couldn’t (though that didn’t stop 
a lot of people), and people didn’t 
even bother putting their phones 
back in their pockets after tak-
ing pictures — every spot was 
another perfect Instagram shot.

We sat at the table where the 

cast does pre-air table reads, 
we stood in the dressing rooms 
next to Gilly, we smelled the 
faint paint fumes in the room 
with some of the original plas-
ter casting molds. We saw every 
cast member’s original headshot 
and, for the finale, we sat in front 
of the complete stage while a 
recording of Tina Fey thanked 
us for coming to visit.

The exhibit, showed the best 

of “SNL,” with all the bonus fea-
tures and extras come to life in 
front of us. It felt like our favorite 
characters were waving goodbye 
as event-goers left the stage.

Or at least, that’s how the 

emotional middle-aged couple 
who followed my friend and me 
out of the gift shop and onto 5th 
Avenue felt.

Personally, I felt a little con-

fused. And then confused about 
my confusion. And then a little 
sad. And then guilty about feel-
ing sad, and then I started to 
slightly resent my parents.

Here’s the thing: obviously, an 

exhibit of “40 years of Saturday 
Nights” would have to be boiled 
down into only the essentials. 
And while I recognized a lot of 
it, there was a lot I didn’t recog-
nize, too. Some I recognized only 
from hearing my parents talk, 
and didn’t personally experience. 
I can only lay claim to a few of 
the most memorable exploits in 
the past few years: Kate McKin-
non’s Justin Bieber, Tina Fey’s 
Sarah Palin and Amy Poehler’s 
Hillary Clinton, Justin Timber-
lake’s Dick in a Box, Shy Ronnie 
and anything Kristen Wiig. But 
the majority of “SNL” ’s “golden 
years” happened before I was 
born, or old enough to appreci-
ate their material. (Incidentally, I 
once made the mistake of refer-
ring to the stint of “SNL” with 
Tina Fey and Amy Poehler as 
the “golden years” to my parents, 
who, remembering the likes of 
Gilda Radner and co., cringed.)

But at the same time, I also felt 

like I could appreciate and con-
nect to the older seasons since I 

saw so much of it on the web. Our 
generation is really the first one 
to have grown up with the abil-
ity to look into the archives of 
history on the Internet and find 
a limitless wealth of text, audio, 
visual and multimedia. I see 
something on the Internet every 
week about “ ’90s kids” (which, 
in case you were wondering, is 
sometimes held to include those 
born anytime between 1990 and 
the early 2000s), and it isn’t 
weird to hear young adults talk-
ing about the ’80s, ’70s or even 
’60s, as if they were there, with 
a kind of familiarity that used to 
belong just to historians. They 
speak as if those years belonged 
to them — because they can 
immerse 
themselves 
in 
the 

media of those times. Because 
of this, the lines between gen-
erational TV trends or pop cul-
ture trends are becoming more 
blurred; the importance or influ-
ence of certain pieces of media 
can’t be documented in as linear 
a fashion as they used to be.

Seeing the “SNL” exhibit 

made me feel nostalgic, which 
was disconcerting. Even though 
I’ve seen most of the important 
or popular sketches on the Inter-
net (including the ones that hap-
pened before I was born), it felt 
weird to be nostalgic for some-
thing that was literally before 
my time.

While it was and still is a 

huge part of my adolescence, 
partly because it reminds me of 
my favorite things about living 
in New York City, “SNL” simul-
taneously does and does not 
belong to me. But maybe in five 
or 10 years, it will.

I want to go to there.

NEW MEDIA NOTEBOOK
Vine a youth issue

By SAM ROSENBERG

For The Daily

Many know Vine as the hugely 

successful app that allows people 
to produce six-second videos on 
their phones. Since its inception in 
2013, Vine has become the go-to 
service for creating and sharing 
inventive, hilarious and bizarre 
clips. The most popular Vines are 

created by people who are consid-
ered “Vine famous,” based on their 
large number of followers and the 
amount of likes and “revines” their 
videos receive. While the “Vine 
famous” community may not be the 
most socially conscious group in 
the country, their influence could 
change our technology-obsessed 
generation for the better.

Recently, Vine partnered with 

Michelle Obama’s new campaign, 
Better Make Room, which pro-
vides creative and educational 
opportunities for high school stu-
dents around the United States. 
According to a press release from 
the White House, Vine’s purpose 
in the campaign is “creating enter-
taining content that will spread the 
campaign’s key messages,” using 
the hashtag #BetterMakeRoom. 
This past week, a group of Viners 
traveled to the White House to 
promote the campaign, and even 
created some Vines with the First 
Lady during their trip, which can 
be seen on Vine’s video playlist 
“Viners go to the White House.” 
Among this group are some of 
Vine’s top-rated users: KingBach 
(14.1M followers), Lele Pons (9.7M 
followers), Jerome Jarre (8.5M fol-
lowers), Us the Duo (4.9M follow-
ers), AmyMarie Gaertner (4.1M 
followers) and Chris Melberger 
(749.4K followers).

As an avid Vine user myself, it’s 

interesting to see these particular 
Viners come together as spokespeo-
ple, considering how different their 
content is. KingBach and Lele Pons 
make everyday scenarios into the-
atrical, over-the-top clips; Jerome 
Jarre plays pranks on unsuspect-
ing strangers; AmyMarie special-
izes in freestyle dance Vines; Us the 
Duo comprises of a young married 
couple singing pop songs; Melberg-
er’s Vines contain self-deprecating 
humor and parodies of other trend-
ing Viners. But although these Vin-
ers may be radically different from 
one another, their collaboration 
to promote Better Make Room 
reinforces their goal of creating a 
positive change in America’s youth 
through social media. As Melberg-
er pointed out when he introduced 
the First Lady at the Better Make 
Room event, creating content on 
Vine and other apps can help build 
creativity, productivity and time 
management skills.

But alas, social media is known 

to be a double-edged sword — and 
Vine is no exception. I believe 
many top viners, including King-
Bach and frequent collaborators 
Destorm Power (5.8M followers) 
and MelvinGregg (3.5M followers) 

tend to perpetuate racial stereo-
types in their Vines, yet they still 
receive millions of followers, likes 
and revines. An example of this 
includes a Vine created late last 
year called “Choir in the hood,” in 
which KingBach and other African-
American Viners scream in operatic 
unison as a Jordans shoe is being 
cut up. Other top Viners, including 
Jerry Purpdrank (8.7M followers) 
and BigNik (2.7M followers), simply 
make videos that are pointless, lazy 
and unfunny — especially if they are 
titled “That moment when you…” or 
“How it feels when … ”

Some of these viners, such as 

Piques (2.8M followers) and Brent 
Rivera (7.9M followers), have even 
been known to plagiarize their 
material. Around two weeks ago, 
Piques posted a vine called “A Mod-
ern Day Romance” that took almost 
the same exact approach as anoth-
er Vine created by DonteMacc 
(513.2K followers) last month. 
Viner Nash Grier (12.2M followers) 
has received lots of controversy for 
making racist, sexist and homo-
phobic jokes in his Vines. Yet, Grier 
profits from a devoted fan base on 
Vine and in person. At a travel-
ing meet-and-greet event called 
Magcon in early 2014, hundreds of 
young girls paid money to see Grier 
and his posse, known as the “Vine 
Boys,” make awkward pun jokes, 
sing, dance and do backflips — so, 
normally what Grier and his posse 
would do in their own Vines.

Perhaps Vine’s growing celeb-

rity culture could be the main 
issue here. How will American 
teens be motivated to create their 
own content if all they see is their 
favorite Viner moving around on 
an oxboard or making a lame joke 
about iPhones? Even if a Viner has 
an insane amount of followers, 
it doesn’t mean he or she should 
be recycling the same material in 
every Vine for the sake of gaining 
followers. Considering that more 
than 200 million people watch 
Vines every month, the content 
produced and whom it affects 
matters. Now that Better Make 
Room has become an official ini-
tiative, top Viners now have the 
responsibility to generate content 
that is more than just entertain-
ment for teenagers. The same can 
be said about anyone who creates 
and shares videos on Vine: It’s 
not about having as many follow-
ers as possible, but about making 
creative, relevant content that 
engages our society through social 
media. And what better way to 
connect to the youth than doing 
just that?

Michigan defense forges 
on with aggressiveness

Wolverines look 
to fight for one 

another after tough 

loss vs. MSU

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

When Dymonte Thomas was 

growing up, his father had some 
words of wisdom for him and his 
family: “You fight one, you fight 
us all.”

Fighting them all would be a 

tall task — Thomas has two older 
brothers, two little sisters and a 
little brother on his dad’s side, and 
an older brother, older sister and 
two little brothers on his mom’s 
side.

Now, as a junior safety for the 

Michigan football team, Thomas 
applies that mindset to the 
Wolverines. Fight the offense, 
and you fight the defense, too. 
Fight the defense, and you fight 
the offense, too. Fight one player, 
and you fight the whole team.

That mindset was on display 

last Saturday when Michigan 
took on Michigan State in a 
crucial rivalry game at Michigan 
Stadium.

On 
2nd-and-9 
from 
the 

Michigan 45-yard line, Michigan 
State quarterback Connor Cook 
ran up the middle, sliding for 
a gain of six. As he lay on the 
ground, Bolden and Spartans 
left tackle Jack Conklin were 
locked in a one-on-one battle, 
and 
Conklin 
pushed 
Bolden 

onto Cook. The officials called 
the penalty, and immediately 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh, 
defensive 
coordinator 
D.J. 

Durkin and defensive line coach 
Greg Mattison started shouting 
and gesturing in protest.

“Hard to fathom,” Harbaugh 

said after the game.

Replay upheld the ruling, and 

when the referee said Bolden 
was disqualified, Bolden turned 
around with a look of disbelief. 

He pointed to himself as if to ask, 
“Me?” He loosened his helmet 
and pleaded his case, but it wasn’t 
enough. Eventually, he did a half-
lap around the field, raising his 
arms to pump up the crowd on his 
way into the tunnel. The Spartans 
needed just two more plays to get 
into the end zone and tie the game 
at seven.

One member of the Michigan 

defense had been scorned. All 
were eager for retribution.

“That’s the kind of mentality 

we build,” Thomas said. “One 
man out, next man up and we 
gotta compete and fill that hole. 
Being a ‘we’ 
team, it allows 
us to be able to 
do that. Next 
guy 
coming 

in is already 
ready, 
and 

the guy who 
just went out 
is most likely 
telling 
him, 

‘Hey, you gotta 
do this, watch 
out for that,’ and then he’ll walk 
off the field.”

On the next series, after the 

Wolverines took the lead with 
a field goal and then gave up a 
quick first down, they smelled 
blood. On 3rd-and-8 from the 
Michigan 
State 
44, 
redshirt 

junior defensive lineman Chris 
Wormley shed his block and 
hammered Cook in the backfield. 
The Spartans had to punt, and 
they gave redshirt freshman 
Jabrill Peppers an opportunity 
for a big play. As he took the ball 
up the sideline and a Michigan 
State coverage man chased him, 
Thomas came in from the side 
and 
blindsided 
the 
Spartan, 

knocking him to the ground. He 
earned more than a few pats on 
the back as he returned to the 
sideline.

Everyone 
remembers 
what 

happened on the final play of the 
game, when the Spartans ran back 
a fumbled punt snap for a game-

winning touchdown. Most people 
even remember Bolden’s targeting 
penalty. What gets lost sometimes 
is what happened right after the 
penalty.

You probably only saw the 

ejection, and not the sack that 
followed it. Or you saw Peppers’ 
return, and not the hit that sprung 
it. But the Wolverines’ message 
had been sent. It was the same 
one Thomas’ father gave him: You 
fight one of them, you fight all of 
them.

“Guys are willing to throw it 

all on the line for each other,” 
Thomas 
said. 
“That 
family 

bond is really 
important. 
That’s 
a 
big 

difference 
— 
we’re 
all 

playing 
for 

each 
other. 

There’s no ‘me’ 
guys out there 
— 
everyone’s 

playing 
for 

each other, and 
we’re more like 

a ‘me’ team than an ‘I’ or a ‘me.’ ”

Wormley’s 
sack, 
Thomas’ 

hit and Peppers’ return helped 
Michigan hold down its lead — 
until the final play. Of course, that 
caveat has taken the luster off of 
statements about Michigan’s play 
against Michigan State.

But 
the 
Wolverines 
insist 

they are unshakeable, much like 
they were after the adversity 
of Bolden’s ejection, and senior 
linebacker James Ross’ the week 
before that.

“We knew that play wasn’t the 

way it was supposed to be ruled, 
but ain’t nothing we can do about 
it,” Thomas said. “We know when 
one (player) goes out, everyone’s 
got to step it up. The next man’s 
got to step it up.”

Michigan returns to the field 

at Minnesota on Saturday night. 
Ross will start, as will Bolden. 
Thomas’ family on defense may 
have faced a setback, but it’s back 
at full strength now.

FOOTBALL

“Guys are 

willing to throw 
it all on the line 
for each other.”

Wolverines’ third line 
excels early in season

By JASON RUBINSTEIN

Daily Sports Editor

Opposing teams might consider 

the 
Michigan 
hockey 
team’s 

first line its best and its second 
line the most 
annoying. But 
they 
should 

start fearing its third line — its 
most steady.

Through four games, that 

line — consisting of freshman 
forwards Brendan Warren and 
Cooper Marody and sophomore 
forward Tony Calderone — has 
combined for seven goals and five 
assists. While that might not be 
the highest total for a Michigan 
line, it’s certainly a surprise that it 
has been this productive thus far, 
considering the line’s youth.

“You never know about young 

players,” said Michigan coach 
Red Berenson. “Tony isn’t a 
young player, even though he is 
a sophomore. But he’s fit in well 
with the other two. Cooper was 
the big question mark heading 
into the year, playing center and 
playing the role that our centers 
need to play.”

It 
definitely 
surprised 

Rensselaer 
Polytechnical 

Institute on Saturday. Warren, 
Calderone and Marody combined 
for seven points against the 
Engineers 
and 
boasted 
a 

combined plus-8 rating.

Against RPI, the trio had goal-

scoring opportunities on most of 
its shifts, and Warren found twine 
twice.

In the first period, Mardoy 

battled for a loose puck behind 
the net and slid the puck to an 
open Warren, who wristed one 
home. Later, it was Calderone 
who weaved by two defenders 
and fired a shot that Warren 
ultimately redirected in.

“Brendan Warren has played 

really well in every game,” 
Berenson said.

And in the third period, 

Calderone lit the lamp himself 
after he found the puck in the 
slot and sniped one past RPI 

netminder Jason Kasdorf.

Prior to the weekend, Marody 

and 
Calderone 
each 
scored 

against Mercyhurst.

Warren attributes their success 

to the immediate chemistry they 
formed the first week of practice. 
Warren said all three of them 
enjoy playing in the dirty areas and 
have a similar mindset on the ice.

“It just clicked from the start,” 

Warren said. “We all want to play 
with speed and down low behind 
the other team’s net, cycle the 
puck well, get it back to the front 
of the net and make plays that 
way.”

Specifically, Warren likes to 

play in the dirty areas and score 
his goals that way, whereas 
Calderone boast one of the 
team’s strongest shots. This is 
all facilitated by Marody, who is 
strong on breakouts and facilitates 
the puck the extremely well.

Warren said he can’t remember 

playing on a line that has clicked 
this fast. And Berenson loves that 
his team has one of the best third 
lines in the country.

GOALTENDING 

QUESTIONS: 
Statistically, 

it 
appears 
junior 
netminder 

Zach Nagelvoort has outplayed 
senior Steve Racine. Nagelvoort 
has allowed four goals in his 
two starts, while Racine has 

surrendered nine in the same 
amount of games.

However, to Berenson, the 

competition is still close. While 
Racine has let in a few soft goals, 
many of his goals are the result 
of porous line changes and poor 
backchecking from the forwards.

So for now, Berenson will 

continue to let the competition 
unfold and won’t name Friday’s 
starter yet.

“I was a one-goalie coach for 

a long time when we had one 
guy who was just the dominant 
goalie,” 
Berenson 
said. 
“We 

haven’t had that since Al Montoya 
(2002 to 2005). You hear (Toronto 
Maple Leafs coach) Mike Babcock 
talk about his dilemma in Toronto, 
and he said ‘Geez, I’ve never had 
to worry about goalies this much 
as I am now.’ Well, I’ve been doing 
that for the past five years.

“It doesn’t matter what a 

perfect world is; we have to live in 
the world we’re living in. I’ve seen 
good things out of both of them. 
I’m pretty open-minded. I’m not 
trying to force the situation into 
something it can’t be.”

INJURIES: Senior forward 

Boo 
Nieves 
didn’t 
play 
in 

Saturday’s game against RPI due 
to an upper-body injury. Berenson 
said he is day to day, and the senior 
hasn’t resumed practicing.

Freshman forward Brendan Warren scored two goals against RPI on Saturday.

NOTEBOOK

Seven stages of grief: The play

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Editor

The thought of the play still 

stings the hearts of Michigan fans. 
In 10 short seconds, a defeat of a top-
10 team and in-state rival turned 
into the Wolverines’ seventh loss 
in eight games against Michigan 
State. The play — in which fifth-
year punter Blake O’Neill fumbled 
a low snap into the arms of Spartan 
safety Jalen Watts-Jackson, who 
ran it 38 yards for a touchdown and 
a 27-23 victory — has been shown 
frequently on seemingly every 
sports channel in the country for 
many of the nine days since it 
occurred.

The stunned crowd of 111,740 

couldn’t believe it, and neither 
could the players. But with games 
once again on the horizon after 
a bye week, both are moving 
forward.

Like any major grievance, 

recovering from the loss to 
the Spartans was a multi-step 
process.

Putting on our therapist hats, 

the Daily takes a look at the team’s 
seven-step process of recovering 
from the loss.

1) Denial

Michigan fans will remember 

this one well. As Michigan State 
piled into the end zone, the fans 
who packed the stands didn’t 
move, unable to comprehend 
what had happened — unable 
to believe it to be true and 
desperately 
hoping 
that 
it 

wasn’t.

The Wolverines left the field, 

but they were just as unclear 
about how the game ended.

“It wasn’t until the next day 

that I believed it was real,” said 
senior 
defensive 
end 
Royce 

Jenkins-Stone 
on 
Monday. 

“Definitely the way we lost was, 
like, unbelievable. Nobody would 

have thought we would have lost 
that way. Just losing to State, 
didn’t want to do that.”

Added senior defensive tackle 

Willie Henry after the loss: “You 
go out there and play your hearts 
out with your teammates, and to 
lose something like that. … It’s 
just hard to gather right now.”

2) Pain and guilt

Once the loss proved to be 

inescapable, the sheer pain of 
such a deflating play set in. The 
loss almost certainly eliminated 
Michigan 
from 
playoff 

contention, and stacks the odds 
against it winning the Big Ten.

In addition, it meant another 

year of thinking about what could 
have been, and hearing about it 
from the Wolverines’ in-state 
rival.

“I’m still not over it. It’s in 

my mind that we lost, but we’ve 
just got to move on,” said junior 
cornerback Jourdan Lewis last 
Tuesday. “We take that loss as a 
lesson, just execute better and 
just work on the things we have 
to work on.”

Though the play was on nearly 

every TV station and dominated 
social 
media 
conversations, 

the players did their best and 
“shied away” from the memory, 
knowing that it wouldn’t go away, 
but hoping it would.

“I mean, I don’t know how 

many times you can see that 
(play happen),” said senior center 
Graham Glasgow. “There were a 
lot of things that had to go their 
way. I would consider it more like 
a miracle than a fluke for them. 
Everything really went more 
their way as opposed to things 
not going our way, but good for 
them.”

3) Anger and bargaining

As time passed, the Wolverines’ 

perspective changed. No longer 
was it about avoiding the play; 
it was about wishing the loss 
couldn’t be pinned on O’Neill, 
placing the focus on all the other 
plays that contributed to the loss.

“That play didn’t lose us the 

game,” Jenkins-Stone said. “We 
had plenty of opportunities to 
win that game before that play. I 
know I left plays on that field — 
we all did.”

O’Neill’s play will forever be 

remembered by football fans as 
the defining moment of the game, 
but the players on the team will 
remember which plays they didn’t 
make, and would do anything to 
try again.

“I know everyone thinks that 

it’s on that last play,” said redshirt 
junior 
wide 
receiver 
Amara 

Darboh. “But there were that we 
could’ve made, and I’m just kind 
of going over it again in my head 
and what I could’ve done better … 
This one just took a little longer.”

4) Reflection

Fortunately 
for 
the 

Wolverines, time was on their 
side in recovery. With a chance 
to go home during fall break, and 
return to practices that Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh said were 
only 50 percent gameplan and 50 
percent individual development, 
Michigan got to reflect not only 
on its goals on the field, but also 
on who it is as a team.

“We had Sunday off, had 

Monday off, so it just gave us 
time to relax and think about the 
game,” said senior defensive back 
Dymonte Thomas. “When we 
came back in, Coach Harbaugh 
said when we go outside, that’s 
our medicine. Whatever’s going 
on, the fresh breeze, the football 
field, the turf and grass and all 
that should just clear your mind 
of anything that’s going on.”

Harbaugh was also quick to 

squash the hypothetical talks 
of last week in his weekly press 
conference Monday.

“(I’m) not into the ‘if-this, 

if-that’ 
type 
of 
scenarios,” 

Harbaugh said. “If worms had 
machine guns, then birds (would) 
be scared of them. We’re looking 
to (define) our season over the 
next number of games that we 
play.”

5) Upward turn

The Wolverines did just that, 

using every hit, play and sprint 
at practice to cope with the 
miracle loss. The players who 
had embraced all of Harbaugh’s 
intense quirks — such as doing 
extra sprints for winning — once 
again looked to their leader for the 
cure. Despite the unique loss, the 
antidote was nothing new.

“We’re doing something very 

special!” 
Harbaugh 
quipped. 

“(It’s a) dirty, four-letter word: 

W-O-R-K.”

6) Reconstruction

By step six of the seven steps, 

the grievers are supposed to have 
some grasp on what happened 
and seek realistic solutions to 
coping in the long term. For the 
Wolverines, this meant planning 
for Minnesota, and understanding 
that there are still at least five 
games left to win.

“It’s on us to start winning 

again and just keep winning every 
game we can,” Henry said. “The 
best way to wash out a bad loss is 
a good win.”

Next up comes Minnesota, 

another trophy game, and — with 
the Golden Gophers struggling 
to a 4-3 start without any quality 
wins — a great opportunity for the 
Wolverines to rebuild after the loss.

“I feel bad for Minnesota,” 

Jenkins-Stone said. “We’re going 
to be coming out with a lot of 

energy now.”

7) Acceptance and hope

It didn’t happen overnight for 

everyone, but Michigan enters 
the week at 5-2, ranked 15th in 
the country, with lofty goals still 
in play and plenty of optimism 
to 
make 
them 
happen. 
The 

Wolverines are two-touchdown 
favorites in their upcoming trip 
to Minnesota, and have a new 
outlook on their previous loss.

“I look back it and just laugh 

about it,” said junior running back 
De’Veon Smith. “Because it was a 
crazy play, a great play by them. I 
laughed in disbelief it happened 
to you because you only see that 
happen to other teams and it just 
so happened to our team.”

Added Harbaugh: “It’s kind of 

like a book: the prologue has been 
written and now if it’s going to be 
a great book, then it’s got to have 
one heck of a conclusion.”

Guard position provides depth for Wolverines

By BRANDON CARNEY

Daily Sports Writer

A combination of new and old 

has spiced up the competition 
among the guards of the Michigan 
women’s basketball team.

The Wolverines return four 

outside 
players 
who 
played 

meaningful minutes last season, 
including two starters — juniors 
Siera Thompson and Danielle 
Williams. Thompson enters the 
year as Michigan’s second-highest 
scorer, scoring 10 points per 
game, but will most likely make 
her presence known leading the 
offense.

After earning 99 assists last 

season, Thompson has a proven 
ability to run the Wolverines’ 
offense, which has made her feel 
confident that she’ll keep her spot 

in the starting five.

Thompson has also excelled at 

helping her teammates find their 
fit in Michigan’s offensive system 
as she looks to become the floor 
general the Wolverines need in 
early games.

“I’ve had to learn and figure 

everyone out,” Thompson said. 
“I’ve needed to figure out who’s 
the best at doing what, especially 
since we lost three starters who 
we knew so well.”

Thompson may be considered 

a lock at the ‘1,’ but who she’ll be 
paired up with in the backcourt 
still remains highly contested.

After an impressive freshman 

season, 
sophomore 
guard 

Katelynn Flaherty may seem 
like the favorite to land next 
to Thompson in the lineup. 
Returning as Michigan’s highest 

scorer and the Big Ten Sixth Player 
of the Year, Flaherty has spent 
a large amount of the offseason 
working on skills she struggled 
with last season.

Michigan coach Kim Barnes 

Arico has seen Flaherty’s ability 
to drive to the basket and 
overall physicality improve. The 
expansion of Flaherty’s game may 
lead to her being able to play more 
positions as well. The possibility of 
playing Flaherty at small forward 
may suit her skills better, opening 
up the shooting guard position for 
others.

Outside of Flaherty, Williams 

and 
senior 
guard 
Madison 

Ristovski both have their eyes on 
a starting spot. Neither Williams 
nor Ristovski have eye-popping 
offensive stats from last season, 
but they make up for it by playing 

tough.

The battle between Williams 

and Ristovski may be the closest 
through the first few weeks of 
practice, but both say it’s made 
them better players and helped the 
unit as a whole.

“It’s super competitive, because 

girls want to get better,” Ristovski 
said. “But at the same time, 
we’re making each other better. 
Everyone’s competing for minutes, 
but it’s also great that we help each 
other, and it’s been important to 
have a group of guards that have 
chemistry.”

Despite the experience the 

returning 
Wolverines 
bring, 

their spots aren’t necessarily 
guaranteed with a talented pair of 
freshmen catching up to them.

Freshman 
guard 
Lauren 

‘Boogie’ 
Brozoski 
has 
made 

a 
serious 
push 
for 
earning 

significant time on the court. The 
Gatorade State Player of the Year 
in New Jersey isn’t expecting to be 
in the mix for a starting position, 
but still has challenged her 
teammates in practice.

“I’ve really been working hard, 

and trying to learn my role,” 
Brozoski said. “I’m not trying to 
say I’m going to fight for a starting 
position, but I know one day I 
will, and it comes with hard work, 
dedication and learning from the 
best around me.”

Barnes 
Arico 
has 
been 

impressed by the effort Brozoski 
and fellow freshman guard Nicole 
Munger have put in, but will 
be tentative in expanding their 
roles as the season begins. The 
pair may need time to adjust to 
the physical grind of a collegiate 

schedule.

“With the freshmen, it’s going 

to be the grind of the season and 
how much they can handle,” 
Barnes Arico said. “How much 
can they handle playing a team 
like Maryland and bouncing back 
and playing in a game two or three 
days later? That’s when you really 
see how ready these freshmen 
are.”

With a variety of options, 

whomever Barnes Arico decides 
to start in the backcourt in the 
Wolverines’ opener on Nov. 8 will 
continue to feel the pressure of 
retaining her spot in a deep and 
talented position.

“Everybody has equal ability 

to score,” Thompson said. “We’ve 
all been working hard to not just 
have one go-to player, but to have 
everyone able to contribute.”
