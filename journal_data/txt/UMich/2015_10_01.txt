CAMPUS CONTEXT

Schlissel has ramped 
up efforts to initiate 
culture change, curb 
drinking on campus

By GENEVIEVE HUMMER

Daily Staff Reporter

University Presi-

dent Mark Schlissel 
and his administra-
tion have spent the 
last 
academic 
year 

working to roll out new 

policy initiatives regarding sev-
eral campus issues — most notably 
athletics, diversity, sexual assault, 
alcohol abuse and Greek life. This 
week, The Michigan Daily reviews 
the events that got the ball roll-
ing. Today, we consider Schlis-
sel’s approach to initiating culture 
changes in Greek life and alcohol 
use on campus.

The overview: Upon arriv-

ing at the University, Schlissel 
said addressing risky drinking 
on campus would be a top prior-
ity for his first year on campus. 

A 2015 study produced by the 
Office of Student Conflict reso-
lution reported that alcohol and 
drug-related violations of the 
Statement of Student Rights and 
Responsibilities increased by 29 
percent over 2014.

The changes: Before this year’s 

Welcome Week, the University 
rolled out a package of initiatives 
designed to curb alcohol abuse 
on campus, including a policy 
to notify the parents of students 
with repeat alcohol offenses and 
a program to ramp up Division 
of Public Safety and Security 
engagement efforts in student-
heavy neighborhoods. Schlissel 
also spoke candidly during an 
all-chapter Greek life meeting, in 
which he called on the organiza-
tion to address its role in perpetu-
ating campus drinking culture.

The context: The first move to 

approach the issue in recent years 
began before Welcome Week in 
2014. In an attempt to decrease 
risky drinking, the University 
opted to shorten Welcome Week. 
The period between dorm move 
in and the first day of classes,

Schlissel, students 
celebrate opening 
of new graduate 
student housing

By LYDIA MURRAY

For the Daily

University officials and stu-

dents highlighted the impor-
tance 
of 
community 
and 

diversity as they celebrated the 
opening of the Munger Gradu-

ate Residences on Wednesday, a 
project largely funded by Univer-
sity alum Charles Munger, a real 
estate mogul.

The residence hall, which 

houses more than 600 graduate 
students from 19 colleges and 
schools in shared, apartment-
style units, aims to bring togeth-
er 
students 
from 
diverse 

backgrounds.

Business 
graduate 
student 

Marco Hidalgo, who is a Munger 
fellow, welcomed attendees by 
describing his experience since 
he moved into the residence hall. 

Fellows 
facilitate 
community 

building and serve as floor lead-
ers.

“I’m outside of my comfort 

zone in every conversation, and 
I’m really enjoying it,” he said.

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel also spoke at the event, 
discussing the importance of 
creating a holistic learning expe-
rience out of the classroom. 

“As I’ve been here now for a 

year, I’ve come to realize that 
every moment here is a pre-
cious opportunity for students to 
learn, and of course that learn-

ing goes on in classrooms, but 
the students are only spending 
a fraction of their time in class-
rooms,” he said.

Kinesiology graduate student 

Catherine Cheung said the resi-
dence hall fosters a unique sense 
of community.

“We have absolutely every-

thing we need,” she said. “So 
much so that the fellows have 
coined the phrase ‘let me Mung-
er that for you,’ meaning let me 
search our Munger community 
for what you’re looking for.”

Federal Perkins 
Loan provided 

$12 million to ‘U’ 
students last year

By SAMANTHA WINTNER

Daily Staff Reporter

Legislation 
enacting 
the 

Federal Perkins Loan Program 
— which provides 500,000 low-
income students with need-
based financial aid to pay for 
college — expired Wednesday.

The Perkins legislation origi-

nally expired in September 
2014, but included a one-year 
extension period so colleges and 
universities could continue to 
award loans after its expiration. 
Wednesday marked the end of 
that extension period.

A bill aiming to reinstate 

the program for one more year 
passed in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives on Monday, but no 

similar bill has made its way 
through the Senate thus far.

Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D–

Mich.) and Gary Peters (D–
Mich.) sponsored a resolution on 
Sept. 24 expressing support for 
the continuation of the Federal 
Perkins Loan program, along 
with several other senators.

In a press release Tuesday, 

Sen. Peters said Perkins loans 
give low-income students the 
chance to earn a degree.

“The Perkins Loan Program 

has helped make higher educa-
tion a possibility for millions of 
students by providing afford-
able, low-interest loans,” he said. 
“I strongly support continuing 
this program to ensure that stu-
dents in Michigan are not priced 
out of the opportunity to get an 
education, and I will be working 
with my colleagues in the Senate 
to ensure that the Perkins Loan 
Program is extended.”

However, until the Senate 

passes a version of the House

Office of National 

Drug Control 
Policy director 
talks recovery

By NABEEL CHOLLAMPAT

Daily Staff Reporter

The drug czar paid a visit to 

campus on Wednesday.

Michael Botticelli, director 

of the White House Office of 
National Drug Control Policy, 
discussed addiction during a 
lecture at Rackham Amphithe-
atre on Wednesday morning.

Botticelli’s position is more 

commonly known as President 
Barack Obama’s “drug czar,” 
and he directs drug control 
policies in the United States. 
His talk, delivered to about 30 
University students and faculty 
members, focused on substance 
abuse recovery and included 

testimonials from doctors and 
recovery patients.

Botticelli, himself a recov-

ered alcoholic, discussed the 
challenges faced by substance 
abusers on their paths to recov-
ery.

“You don’t see hope on the 

other side,” Boticelli said. “We 
have to provide hope and have 
people see what recovery is all 
about.”

 Fraternity pledges 
to appeal decision 
after IFC votes to 

expel chapter 

By ISOBEL FUTTER

Daily Staff Reporter

At the weekly Interfraternity 

Council presidents’ meeting, fra-
ternity chapter executives voted to 
officially remove the Delta Kappa 
Epsilon fraternity from the IFC.

IFC President Alex Krupiak, an 

LSA senior, said the fraternity was 
removed for attempts to merge 
with Sig, a rogue fraternity.

“They were forming a merger 

with an off-campus that was for-
merly known as Sig and they had 
a lot of different allocations and 
problems with them,” Krupiak 
said. “The IFC did not approve of 
that merger.”

DKE President Evan Field, an 

Engineering junior, said in an 
e-mail statement that the frater-
nity is tremendously disappointed 
with the result of Wednesday’s IFC

Nixon Road development plan 
postponed for further debate

Navanethem Pillay 
discusses women’s 

rights, refugees

BY CAMY METWALLY

For the Daily

In a lecture hall thousands of 

miles away from South Africa, 
Judge Navanethem Pillay, for-
mer United Nations High Com-
missioner for Human Rights, 
addressed the University com-
munity in a public lecture titled 
“From South Africa to Rwanda 
and Syria.”

Though far from the sugar 

plantations 
her 
grandfather 

worked on as an indentured 
laborer in South Africa, Pillay 
spent the last few days on cam-
pus, engaging with several stu-
dent groups for the University 
of Michigan Law School’s 2015 
William W. Bishop Jr. Lecture 
in International Law.

On Sept. 29, she spoke to 

undergraduates in the Human 
Rights Initiative as well as a 
number of law students in vari-
ous organizations. Wednesday 
morning she met with the Law 

School’s human trafficking clin-
ic before delivering a speech in 
the afternoon.

“I love the fact that students 

from other disciplines, like engi-
neering and economics, also 
attend this, not just law stu-
dents. That’s very good because 
human rights concerns every-
one,” Pillay said.

As a minority in both race 

and gender, Pillay said she faced 
many obstacles. However, her 
real journey began when her 
father, a bus driver, and her 
seven siblings struggled to sat-
isfy their hunger — both for food 
and education.

With schoolteachers walk-

ing door to door, the poor com-
munity in which Pillay grew up 
raised funds to send “the girl 
with potential” to a university.

“We were all victims of dis-

crimination and deprivation,” 
Pillay said. “So when I became 
a lawyer against all odds, it was 
not a singular achievement.”

When she began practic-

ing as an attorney, gender, race 
and economic class proved to 
be growing challenges for Pil-
lay, especially in the climate 
of apartheid. According to Pil-

lay, after law school, law firms 
refused to hire her because 
white secretaries could not work 
for a black woman. These adver-
sities led to Pillay starting her 
own law firm in 1967, the first 
woman to do so in South Africa’s 
Natal Province.

She has also served as a judge 

on the International Criminal 
Court, judge president of the 
International Criminal Tribunal 
for Rwanda and acting judge of 
the High Court in South Africa, 
appointed by Nelson Mandela.

“It’s an honor to come hear 

her speak,” third-year Law stu-
dent Daniela Tagtachian said. 
“It’s always good to hear the 
story of a woman who led such 
a distinguished life. It’s par-
ticularly inspiring hearing a 
woman speak about such great 
things.”

In addition to protecting 

women’s rights and promoting 
the cause as a respected female 
role model and co-founder of 
Equality Now, an international 
women’s rights organization, 
Pillay also spoke of growing 
unrest in the world.

Wetland protection, 
water runoff, traffic 
present concerns for 

nearby residents

BY ISOBEL FUTTER

Daily Staff Reporter

After the Ann Arbor City 

Council postponed discussion 
last week on a proposed hous-
ing development on Nixon Road, 
the conversation is now set to 
occur in November.The site plan 
for the proposed 282-unit Wood-
bury Club Apartments has been 
discussed at the last two coun-
cil meetings, but at the Sept. 21 
meeting, the conversation was 
postponed to the Nov. 16 meeting. 
The Council is requested more 
research and planning before the 
next hearing on the subject. Con-
cerns with traffic, natural land-
scape, wetlands and stormwater 
runoff were among the reasons 

for postponement. The plan also 
requires a zoning change to move 
forward.

The apartment complex would 

be located on the corner of Nixon 
Road and M-14. They would be 
situated across the street from 
another proposed development 
on the site of the two Nixon Farm 
properties.

Councilmember Sumi Kailasa-

pathy (D–Ward 1) said she would 
have a resolution drafted by the 
next meeting, though it will not 
be discussed at that time.

Several community and Coun-

cil members were concerned that 
adding new housing in the area 
would increase existing traffic 
congestion.

The area’s natural environ-

ment was another concern to the 
development plan — specifically, 
issues of stormwater runoff and 
flooding. According to Kailasa-
pathy, the burden of stormwater 
runoffs on neighboring commu-
nities is increasing.

“We know that significant rain 

events are growing in intensity 
and volume, which causes sig-
nificant expenses to the city and 
property owners,” she said.

If the apartments are approved, 

the water runoff could be pushed 
to nearby apartment complexes. 
This could cause extensive flood-
ing and water drainage issues, 
resulting in additional costs to the 
city and neighboring residents.

William 
Quinn, 
president 

of the board of directors for 
Barclay Park Condominiums, 
located 
near 
the 
proposed 

development,said the board is 
against the project.

“We are very concerned about 

the wetlands which border Bar-
clay Park and which are within 
the park,” Quinn said. 

Collin Ross, president of the 

board of directors for the Arbor 
Hills Condominium Association 
also attended the meeting. Ross 
said the association has filed a 
petition of protest against the 
approval of the site plan.

“I should point out that the 

system in Arbor Hills is a private 
system that is paid for and main-
tained by our association,” Ross 
said. “Therefore, any additional 
stormwater loads on the system 
could cause problems and result 
in significant expenses to our 
association.”

The Woodbury Club Apart-

ments site plan is split into two 
parcels, an eastern and a west-
ern side. Though apartments 
have been allocated for the 
western parcel, plans for the 
eastern parcel are still unclear. 
It is possible that the city may 
buy the approximately 25 acres 
for parkland.

Some members of Council 

expressed their concern about 
this undetermined sector of the 
plan at the most recent Council 
meeting on Sept. 21. Council-
member Jack Eaton (D–Ward 4) 
said he would like to see those 
plans resolved before a vote to 
rezone the property and pave 
way for the development occurs.

DAVID SONG/Daily

Judge Navanethem Pillay, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights from 2008-2014 and co-founder 
of Equality Now, recalls her experiences with apartheid and its influence on her development as both a law student 
and a human at South Hall on Wednesday. 


The project was driven in large 

part by Munger, both in terms of 
providing a vision for the final 
product and funding most of the 
construction costs. The real estate 
tycoon had previously funded a 
similar model of graduate stu-
dent housing at Stanford Univer-
sity, and his record-breaking $110 
million donation to the Univer-
sity in September 2013 was given 
expressly to fund such a project in 
Ann Arbor.

E. Royster Harper, vice presi-

dent for student life, said Munger 
brought a unique perspective to 
the project.

“Charlie’s vision was uncon-

ventional,” she said. “It broke a 
lot of rules about what people 
thought was possible in graduate 
education, and it didn’t consult 
any of the people who thought 
they should be consulted.”

This 
approach 
sometimes 

drew criticism from students, 
particularly those who criticized 
the price tag to live there, which 
is between $850 and $900 per 
month, but was originally slated 
to total about $1,000 monthly.

Schlissel praised the forward-

thinking ambition of Munger and 
credited him for the project’s suc-
cess.

“He approached the University 

with a different way of thinking 
about living and learning space,” 
Schlissel said. “A way that would 
purposefully foster the kind of 
interactions that lead to the con-
nections across disciplines that 
will actually solve big problems.”

Social Work student Arlene 

Chandra said living in Munger 
has been a positive experience so 
far.

“As a social worker I’m going to 

be coming across so many differ-
ent walks of life and I’m going to 
need to be able to connect with all 
my clients and what they’ve expe-
rienced,” she said. “By living with 
so many different people, I am 
able to learn about different top-
ics and how to engage with other 
students.”

bill, colleges can grant Perkins 
loans to students who applied 
before July 1 for the current school 
year, but will not grant new loans 
to new students.

Institutions 
can 
continue 

awarding Perkins loans to stu-
dents who had been offered those 
loans in the 2014-2015 school year. 
These students are eligible for 
ongoing Perkins loans until Sept. 
30, 2020, or until they graduate if 
that date is sooner, so long as they 
remain in the degree programs in 
which they were enrolled when 
offered their most recent loan.

Under the program, these 

500,000 students are awarded a 
total of approximately $1 billion 
a year at about 1,500 colleges and 
universities nationwide. Program 
advocates argue that the funds, 
which are only a small portion of 
the $150 billion the federal gov-
ernment awards in student loans 
and grants each year, have made 
higher education possible for mil-
lions of students in the U.S.

However, Mark Kantrowitz, 

publisher of the college financial 
planning website edvisors.com, 
argued the Perkins program has a 
less significant impact than other 
federal student loan programs, 
namely the Federal Stafford loan 
program, which he said accounts 
for about $100 billion in federal 
financial aid.

Kantrowitz said the average 

Perkins loan is relatively small: 

usually 
between 
$1,000 
and 

$2,000.

According to Margaret Rodri-

guez, senior associate director at 
the University’s Office of Financial 
Aid, the federal government sub-
sidized the cost of Perkins loans 
when the program began. How-
ever, it has not allocated funds to 
the Perkins program since 2004.

“When the program started, 

the federal government provided 
funds to the institutions to make 
loans,” she said. “And then the 
institutions had to match those 
funds with some of their own 
money.”

Rodriguez said the lack of fed-

eral funds has not stopped colleg-
es from awarding Perkins loans. 
The University, she said, has been 
using repayments from previously 
awarded loans to offer new loans 
to current students. She also noted 
eligibility for Perkins grants is 
based upon demonstrated need, 
which is determined by the infor-
mation students provide on the 
FAFSA.

“We have a certain amount 

of money available — and that 
depends on how much is col-
lected in any particular year — 
and we use those funds to help 
needy students, both graduate and 
undergraduate, meet their costs of 
education,” she said. “So we look 
at our applicant pool every year 
and determine how much we can 
offer (to each student).”

Rodriguez said 4,500 under-

graduate and graduate students 
at the University receive Per-
kins loans, and that last year the 

University 
had 
approximately 

$12 million available last year to 
award in Perkins loans alone.

In total, according to the Uni-

versity’s Office of Budget and 
Planning, the University awarded 
more than $200 million in finan-
cial aid to its students in 2014.

“The Perkins loan is part of 

what we call an aid package — put 
together with grants, scholar-
ships, work study in some cases, 
and federal direct loans to offer a 
variety of sources of aid students 
can use to meet their need,” Rodri-
guez said.

Kantrowitz said colleges are 

typically attracted to awarding 
Perkins loans to students because 
they are associated with greater 
flexibility. Perkins loans, he said, 
are a form of campus-based aid, 
and individual schools are able 
to choose which students receive 
them.

“Colleges often use the Perkins 

loan money to fill in gaps in their 
financial aid packages,” he said.

Students who receive these 

loans pay no interest while they 
are in school, and when they grad-
uate, their loans will carry a 5-per-
cent fixed rate. Additionally, if 
borrowers commit to certain pub-
lic service jobs after graduation 
for between one and five years, 
they are eligible to have all or part 
of their Perkins loans forgiven.

Kantrowitz said he, too, is not 

optimistic the Senate will act to 
continue the program. However, 
he argued this is a positive: it 
would be cost-effective to elimi-
nate the program, and expand the 

Federal Stafford Loan program 
instead.

He said Perkins loans were 

created for those with the high-
est need, but in practice they are 
awarded to any student with 
financial assistance, regardless of 
their relative need.

“There is a feeling in Congress 

that the Perkins loan program is 
redundant,” he said. “It overlaps 
with the existing loan programs, 
doesn’t add a lot of value.”

Kantrowitz said if Congress 

decided to extend the program to 
new borrowers for one more year, 
it would incur avoidable costs. To 
account for those costs, he said, 
Congress would eliminate the 
portion of the program called 
“grandfathering” — which is what 
guarantees students who previ-
ously received Perkins loans will 
get more in the future.

“The thinking of opponents of 

the Perkins program is that elimi-
nating the grandfathering makes 
it a lot easier to kill off the pro-
gram entirely,” he said.

Kantrowitz also noted that 

some in the Senate are propo-
nents of simplification and won’t 
see value in extending the pro-
gram.

“Especially considering that 

for a longer term extension, Con-
gress would have to spend money, 
and Congress is in a budget-
cutting mood, not an increas-
ing spending mood,” he said. 
“And where would they get the 
money?”

Colleges will fight for this pro-

gram he said, because they’re 

focusing on promulgating their 
existing policies and not consid-
ering what is best for financial aid 
policy in the future.

“A 
much 
better 
approach 

would be to get rid of the Perkins 
Loan program and instead some-
how expand the Stafford Loan 
program — maybe expanding the 
loan limits or adding some addi-
tional flexibility to the program, 
loan forgiveness, or something,” 
he said.

Though colleges would lose 

some leeway in their financial aid 
budgeting processes, Kantrowitz 
said, the amount would be man-
ageable. The expiration of the 
program, he said, would not be 
terribly significant and colleges 
could devise their own loan pro-
grams to replace the Perkins pro-
gram if they wished.

Though Rodriguez said she is 

unsure if the Senate will approve 
the House bill to reinstate the 
program, she is not hopeful. She 
also said the University remains 
committed 
to 
satisfying 
the 

financial needs of its students, 
despite the expiration of the Per-
kins loan program.

“Of course losing an aid pro-

gram that provides $12 million 
is significant, but the University 
is looking for ways that it can 
continue to meet the full need 
of Michigan residents and offer 
competitive aid packages to non-
residents,” she said. “We’ve been 
studying the issue for a while: 
we knew that there was always 
a possibility that the program 
would go away.”

tation considered the stigma 
around recovering patients. He 
said this shame felt by drug users 
can actually prevent them from 
seeking the care they need.

“One of the things we need to 

continue to work on is the role 
that language plays in perpetu-
ating stigma,” Botticelli said. 
“People are afraid of what their 
neighbors think, what the police 
will think, so we know that stig-
ma has an impact in delaying 

care.”

According to the Office of 

Adolescent Health over one in 
five high school seniors reported 
“binge drinking” daily in the pre-
vious month. By senior year, half 
of adolescents have abused an 
illicit drug one or more times. On 
college campuses, the numbers 
are larger, and the most common 
drugs abused include marijuana, 
Adderall and ecstasy.

Recently, a study by University 

researchers showed an increase 
in the use of all three of these 
drugs by college-aged students.

Botticelli 
emphasized 
the 

importance of young people 
supporting those close to them 
who are in recovery. He said 
young people are less likely to be 
embarrassed when talking about 
addiction, particularly because 
so many substance abusers are in 
their teens or early 20s. 

“What I find tremendously 

invigorating is the role of young 
people in recovery,” he said. “We 
have this explosion of young 
people in recovery who are not 
going to be silenced by shame 
and stigma.”

At the event, Donald Vereen, 

director of the University’s Sub-

stance Abuse Research Cen-
ter, presented on the biological 
aspects of substance abuse. His 
slides graphically depicted the 
harmful effects of regular use 
of drugs like cocaine, marijuana 
and methamphetamine, includ-
ing dangerously high dopamine 
levels and slowed brain activity.

He also noted how difficult it 

is to treat these cases.

“There are these expectations 

that when you have a disease 
and when you enter treatment, 
you will be cured,” Vereen said. 
“There are very few things we 
actually cure in medicine.”

Public Health student Lau-

ren Boone attended the lecture 
because of her interest in drug 
education.

“(It) was informative in help-

ing me to understand what is 
going on federally and biologi-
cally and it helped me to identify 
areas that I can contribute to in 
my research specifically in terms 
of drug education,” she said.

Botticelli 
said 
the 
White 

House’s agenda for substance 
abuse help includes promoting 
collegiate recovery programs 
and engaging in general out-
reach.

meeting.

“It was, and still is, our belief 

that the right to choose our own 
members is a crucial part of self 
governance,” he wrote. “We will 
appeal this decision and believe 
that we have a strong case. The fact 
that the IFC came to this decision 
without a precipitating incident is 
extremely disheartening and calls 
into question the motives and val-
ues of the member chapters.”

LSA senior Nick Swider, Delta 

Sigma Phi president, said IFC 
chapter presidents voted on the 
issue at last week’s meeting, but 
did not achieve a two-thirds major-
ity to expel the fraternity. Swider 
emphasized that he was not speak-
ing on behalf of his fraternity.

“We’ve been alerted multiple 

times through the Office of Greek 
Life that we are not allowed to 
affiliate ourselves with these 
particular 
individuals, 
that 

they’re bad news, just stay away,” 
Swider said.

Swider said a DKE national 

adviser attended the meeting in 
support of the merger. He said 
the executive board in atten-
dance requested a lesser pun-
ishment, suggesting IFC keep a 
closer eye on them rather than 
expelling the chapter.

After failing to abandon the 

merger 
before 
Wednesday’s 

meeting, 
the 
expulsion 
was 

brought to another vote, this time 
receiving the necessary majority.

“We have bylaws for a reason, 

the bylaws that we do not affili-
ate with a rogue organization and 
if we do, we have consequences 
through the Greek Activities 
Review Panel or there’s conse-
quences that the presidents can 
directly take against us which 
is what we saw tonight.” Swider 
said. 

Field spoke at the IFC meeting 

and justified their reasoning for 
recruiting the Sig members.

“(Field) explained that over the 

summer months and beginning of 
the school year, he had [COPY: 
“been”?] 
working 
extensively 

with their national organization, 
their membership and appar-
ently had even taken a vote from 
the membership back in April,” 
Swider said. “The membership 
by a simple majority agreed to 
take the kids in Sig into DKE and 
merge the chapters.”

according to administrators, is 
generally marked by increased 
alcohol consumption.

Last fall, DPSS said a short-

ened Welcome Week reduced on-
campus alcohol-related activity 
during that time. The number of 
ambulance requests to Universi-
ty Housing facilities, calls to the 
DPSS Communications Center 
related to drinking, noise com-
plaints, urinating in public and 
visits to University Emergency 
Departments all dropped consid-
erably from 2013.

However, 
events 
during 

the last year have shed a more 
intense light on the University’s 
party culture.

In January, four University 

fraternities and sororities inflict-
ed hundreds of thousands of dol-
lars worth of property damage 
on two ski resorts in northern 
Michigan.

The Sigma Alpha Mu frater-

nity and Sigma Delta Tau soror-
ity, who stayed at the Treetops 
Resort in Gaylord, Mich. during 
the weekend of Jan. 16, were esti-
mated to have caused $430,000 
in damages, according to the 
resort’s general manager.

That same weekend, fraterni-

ties Pi Kappa Alpha and Chi Psi 
and sororities Delta Gamma and 
Alpha Phi damaged rooms at 
Boyne Highlands, a ski resort in 
Harbor Springs, Mich.

The damage reported at the 

two resorts included felled ceil-
ing tiles, broken walls and dis-
mantled furniture.

Both Schlissel and E. Royster 

Harper, vice president for stu-
dent life, have insisted on the 
necessity of creating a social 
environment less influenced by 
alcohol.

In a January interview with 

the Daily, Harper said the Janu-
ary ski trip incidents illustrated 
part of the problem at hand.

“We can’t keep going this 

way,” she said. “Too much at risk. 
Too many safety issues. We can’t 
keep behaving like we have this 
system, and because there are so 
many good things about the sys-
tem, that makes the things that 
are unhealthy and dangerous 
about the system OK. And that’s 
what we’ve been doing. I think 

that Up North was a wakeup call 
for us as an institution and as a 
community.”

However, 
Schlissel 
has 

acknowledged that expecting 
students not to drink is an unre-
alistic goal, and he would focus 
the bulk of his efforts on efforts 
to reduce the harm.

“I think it’s impractical to have 

as a goal that students won’t drink 
on campus,” he said in a Novem-
ber interview with the Daily. 
“Even though most of students 
are drinking illegally, I don’t think 
that’s an enforceable law, but look-
ing at it from the safety perspec-
tive is what I want to do.”

***

In the past month, the Uni-

versity has launched or floated 
ideas to introduce several initia-
tives designed to curb drinking 
on campus, as well as a party 
culture administrators have said 
Greek life plays a role in.

In August, the University 

unveiled a plan to involve the 
parents of first-year students 
who violate school alcohol poli-
cies on a case-by-case basis.

The University plans to notify 

parents if a first-year student 
under the age of 21 “commits a 
violation accompanied by other 
serious behavior such as need-
ing medical attention, signifi-
cant property damage or driving 
under the influence,” or if one 
of these students “has a second 
alcohol or drug infraction.”

Harper said the policy will 

only be implemented in certain 
instances.

“Part of what we have talked 

about is trying to leave some 
space,” Harper said. “Should, in 
the course of having a conver-
sation with a student, there is a 
sense that actually calling would 
not be in their best interest, then 
we won’t.”

Mary Jo Desprez, the direc-

tor of Wolverine Wellness, said 
the policy is not meant as a 
punishment, but as a preventa-
tive measure. She pointed to the 
close relationship many students 
share with their parents.

“Part of this also is, students 

tell us, when we ask them, ‘Who 
is the biggest influence on your 
decisions and your values?’ they 
always say parents or family,” 
Desprez said. “So part of this is 
us partnering with the people 
they have told us are the biggest 

part of their support network.”

In a September interview with 

the Daily, Harper said the Uni-
versity was considering delaying 
Greek rush.

“Does it make sense to have 

students come, and in a week, by 
the whole pledging process, we 
have thrown them into a whole 
environment that we’re worried 
about?” Harper asked. “Should 
we stay on this path we have, 
where we’ve been so committed 
to self-governance, that we allow 
rush to happen sometimes less 
than a week after students get 
here? So we’re certainly going to 
take a look at that.”

Members of the University’s 

Senate 
Advisory 
Committee 

on University Affairs have also 
floated the idea of increasing the 
number of Friday classes to curb 
Thursday night drinking — a 
move University Provost Mar-
tha Pollack has said she would be 
open to.

The administration has seem-

ingly identified Greek life as help-
ing drive a University culture 
marked by excessive drinking. In 
September, the University called 
a historic, all-chapter meeting of 
Greek life, in which administra-
tors said change must occur, or 
the future of Greek life could be 
in peril.

Schlissel told the crowd that 

the University’s reputation was 
at stake.

“The value of their degrees are 

gonna go down because the repu-
tation of the University of Michi-
gan won’t be the excitement in 
the Big House or our teams doing 
well under our fantastic new 
coach,” he said. “It’s not gonna be 
the kids who receive the Rhodes 
Scholarships and the Fulbright 
Scholarships, and the famous 
professors who do the work that 
you’re going to get reflected on 
for, or the National Medal for the 
Arts that our faculty won this 
past week. It’s going to be the 
‘Shmacked’ videos. So it’s really 
up to you what the value of your 
education is going to be, what the 
reputation of this institution’s 
going to be.”

Moving forward: In response 

to negative attention directed at 
Greek life in the last year, LSA 
junior Sean Pitt, vice president 
of public relations for the Uni-
versity’s Interfraternity Council, 
said the IFC has begun to revise 

its existing risk management 
policies.

“This summer, the Interfra-

ternity Council … has under-
taken a major review of all of 
our risk management policies to 
determine how and where they 
can be strengthened in order 
to better protect and educate 
our members,” Pitt wrote in an 
e-mail. “In addition to this work, 
we have been rapidly developing 
and escalating our existing part-
nerships with SAPAC and UHS 
to bring peer led, Greek Life tai-
lored, sexual assault prevention 
presentations to our chapters in 
order to ensure the retention of 
bystander intervention training 
information that our members 
are given upon entry into the 
Greek Community.”

Pitt said the IFC worked to 

address 
sexual 
assault 
even 

before the University’s survey 
results on the topic were released 
over the summer.

Among these efforts, he said 

Winter 2015 pledges signed a 
sexual misconduct prevention 
pledge “agreeing to voluntarily 
resign their membership if they 
do not uphold the ideals, stan-
dards, and values of the Inter-
fraternity Council and Greek 
Community at the University of 
Michigan and commit an act of 
sexual misconduct.”

Members of Greek life have 

had mixed reactions to the 
administration’s calls for reform. 
Many sorority and fraternity 
members 
expressed 
frustra-

tion with the administration 
for effectively linking the Greek 
community to the problem of 
excessive alcohol consumption.

“That was the one big thing 

that people were against is that 
it was spoken as just the Greek 
community,” 
one 
fraternity 

member told the Daily after the 
September Greek life meeting 
with Schlissel. “If anything, a 
lot of the times when incidents 
happen it’s people from outside 
of the organization that come to 
our parties and cause trouble. So, 
it’s a message that really should 
have been transmitted to the 
entire University.”

Many members who spoke 

with the Daily said Greek life 
actually does a better job than 
other organizations at ensuring 
parties are safe. Unlike students 
hosting house parties or ath-

letic teams hosting team parties, 
members say Greek life parties 
are heavily regulated.

“We have sober monitors, 

attendance lists, strict alcohol 
rules and risk-management poli-
cies,” one member said. “Remov-
ing Greek life wouldn’t remove 
parties, it would remove safe 
parties.”

Dean of Students Laura Blake 

Jones said enacting change in the 
Greek community will require 
more 
comprehensive 
support 

— from national organizations, 
the Office of Greek Life, alumni 
advisors and parents.

“I’ve been talking with a lot 

of parents of Greek life stu-
dents who, similarly, want to be 
involved in helping support, and 
so we’re taking a really compre-
hensive approach to how do we 
create a foundation for these 
organizations 
to 
work 
from 

that’s really going to help them 
to be able to live into their values 
and be all the positive things that 
we know Greek life can be in the 
community,” Blake Jones said.

She added that any work to 

improve Greek culture will have 
to focus on a variety of issues.

“We have five major areas of 

emphasis where we think we 
need to do work. The first one is 
education, the second one is lead-
ership development, the third one 
is risk management, the fourth 
one is environmental manage-
ment and the fifth is accountabil-
ity measures,” Jones said.

She acknowledged that hav-

ing the entire Greek community, 
rather than just executive offi-
cers, care about enacting a cul-
ture shift will be key to making 
real progress.

“There’s such a focus at times 

in some groups on the social 
scene, and then that eclipses the 
service, the academic focus, sis-
terhood, the brotherhood — the 
other common elements of the 
values,” she said. “And so if we 
could have our groups moder-
ate their behavior and really be 
thoughtful about potential harm 
that could happen, and have not 
just the president and the social 
chair and the risk manager 
worry about those things, but 
everybody in the organization 
understand and be committed to 
wanting to ensure the safety of 
everyone, we would come a long, 
long way in achieving our goals.”

“Organic” does not mean “healthy”

Take a walk in the park

I 

once would have laughed at the 
thought of grocery stores being 
trendy. There are fashion trends, 

there 
are 
TV 

show trends and 
there are music 
trends, but lately, 
where you buy 
your food comes 
along with social 
stereotypes.

Health 
food, 

in 
particular, 

is 
especially 

trendy. 
Every 

day there seems 
to be some new, 
non-fat, 
low-carb, 
chia, 
super-

fruit, probiotic blend marketed as 
the cure for everything. It is the 
prevalence of these products that 
can make grocery shopping in Ann 
Arbor legitimately excruciating. 
There have been times when I’m 
surviving on oatmeal and granola 
bars for days just because I don’t 
want to go spend my Whole Pay-
check at Whole Foods.

The summer after my freshman 

year, I worked in a research lab on 
campus. Without the added stress 
of classes and snow, it was much 
easier to settle into a healthy rou-
tine of running, yoga, lifting and 
proper nutrition. I even had time 
to watch the documentaries “Fed 
Up” and “Food Inc.” (both avail-
able on Netflix and both I highly 
recommend), which gave me a new 
perspective on processed foods, 
especially meat. At that point, I 
was subject to the trendiness of 
chia seeds and matcha powder, and 
I was under the impression that in 
order for food to be healthy, I had to 
buy from stores that market them-
selves as such. Since then, I have 
realized this to be false.

For me, it came down to the 

research, and there is absolutely no 
evidence that the organic food one 
can buy at Whole Foods is better 
for you than the organic food pur-
chased at a conventional grocery 
store. There are plenty of resourc-
es in Ann Arbor through which 
one can buy healthy foods without 
spending everything in your wallet.

Farmers markets are one place 

where it is easy to get fresh, local food 
without the price tag of an upscale 
grocery store. In Kerrytown, every 
Saturday and Wednesday between 7 
a.m. and 3 p.m., there are local farm-
ers, gardeners, bakers and others 
selling fruit, vegetables, meat, eggs, 
gelato, baked goods, pesto, pasta and 
anything else in season.

Trader Joe’s is my first choice 

during the months when the entire 
state is buried in snow. For a while, 
people didn’t know about Trader 
Joe’s, and it was only when health 
food shopping became “trendy” 
that it became mainstream. Before 
that, people would just ask, “Why 
do your Oreos look so weird?” and 
when I responded that they were 
from Trader Joe’s they would say, 
“What’s that?” You could even say 
that Trader Joe’s got lucky; they’ve 
always been centered on organic 
and healthy food, but the popular-
ity of eating well has just brought 
it to everyone’s attention and made 
it trendy. Even though it carries 
this reputation now, it is actually 
cheaper than places like Whole 
Foods. The trick with both of these 
stores, though, is not to get caught 
up in the “magic” foods that claim 
to change your life.

Although not as “fashionable” as 

the stores mentioned above, Kroger 
and Meijer can also be resources for 
healthy options. Be aware that sifting 
through organic, non-organic, pro-
cessed, refined, artificial and natural 
products can be a challenge if you 
don’t know what you’re looking for. 
First, know that non-organic products 
won’t poison you. If you are looking 
for organic, both of these stores have 
generically-labeled products. Also to 
this point, generic is okay.

It is important to distinguish 

that “organic” and “healthy” are 
not synonymous. In fact, a 2012 
systematic review revealed no sig-
nificant difference between organic 
and inorganic foods in vitamin con-
tent and nutrient content (with the 
exception of phosphorus and phe-
nols). Pesticide residues, however, 
were significantly more likely to be 
found in non-organic products than 
organic products. However, it is 
also cost-effective to keep in mind 

that not all commercial and organic 
foods are equal. Soft fruits such as 
peaches, nectarines and berries; 
vegetables including peppers and 
carrots; starches such as potatoes; 
and beef are more important to buy 
organic than other products.

Meats are particularly important 

to buy in the free-range, grass-fed 
variety. Unlike most produce, it is 
shown that nutrient content is vast-
ly different between these and com-
mercially produced meat products. 
First, the photos of concentrated 
animal feeding operations are some 
of the most disturbing images I’ve 
seen regarding the food industry. 
Second, and even more concern-
ing, is the fact that the lives of the 
animals in these pens, in addition 
to the use of corn as feed for these 
animals causes the meat to be less 
nutritive, and can result in harmful, 
acid-resistant E. coli outbreaks with 
potentially disastrous consequenc-
es. The runoff from these farms 
also contributes to E. coli outbreaks 
in spinach and even apple juice (all 
the more reason to buy some of your 
foods organic). The most disturbing 
part? While it seems intuitive that 
with technology developments food 
would be getting safer, it is actually 
becoming easier for these harm-
ful pathogens to spread. Accord-
ing to “Food Inc.,” there were once 
“thousands of slaughterhouses in 
the United States. Today we have 
13 slaughterhouses that process the 
majority of beef that is sold in the 
United States. The hamburger of 
today, it has pieces of thousands of 
different cattle ground up in that 
one hamburger patty.” Ew.

What it comes down to is the 

difference between being smart 
and being trendy. Choosing wisely 
where and on what to spend the few 
dollars I have can be overwhelming 
when trying pick healthy options. 

Pick and choose when to go 

organic and when to let it go. It’s 
about balancing your checkbook, 
your health and the ever-so-diffi-
cult transportation to any of these 
food destinations.

CARPE DIEM, MICHIGAN STUDENTS

I

n our years as University students, I’m 
sure all of us have crossed through a 
city park at least a couple of times. We 

pass beneath the trees on 
the streets of Ann Arbor 
every day, whether it’s on 
a morning run, on our way 
to get groceries or during 
the 10-minute walk across 
the Diag to our next class. 
Yet I find that even when 
I’m trying to be interested, 
it’s sometimes easier to 
look at a screen or worry 
about my to-do list than 
it is to watch the leaves 
of the trees as they move 
against the sky. I want to 
be paying attention to the world around me, 
taking the moments of my walking as a time 
to unwind instead of fretting about upcoming 
commitments. And sometimes, taking a walk 
in the park is the best way 
to get that to happen.

The parks of Ann Arbor 

are 
a 
distinguishing 

characteristic, 
creating 

pockets of cool air and 
shade that border the 
built-up downtown. Parks 
closer 
to 
campus 
are 

probably the ones used 
the most by students, but 
my favorite is West Park — 
because I live on the same 
block, I walk through it almost every day. To 
my knowledge, this is one of the larger parks 
in the city, featuring stands of old oak trees, 
scattered wildflowers and two picturesque 
ponds. There are grills and tables for picnics, 
open grassy areas for a quick game of Frisbee 
or soccer and a fenced-in baseball field where 
dogs are allowed to run off-leash. With a 
playground, basketball court and community 
garden as well, the park is a place where 
residents of the city can come to enjoy the 
outdoors in whatever way is most attractive 
to them.

Time spent in the park is relaxing for 

me because it’s a part of my day when I’m 
walking and not working — and while I might 
have my to-do list in the back of my mind, 
I’m not actively trying to accomplish things 
from it in that moment. Sometimes walking 
in the shadows of the oak trees can lead to 
inspiration, but not always. When I don’t find 
insight in my morning strolls through the 
park, I’m still beginning to sort my priorities 

for the day, the next couple of days, and the 
week — and maybe laughing at the antics of 
whatever dog happens to be running around 
the baseball field at the moment.

There are more than 2,000 acres of parks in 

Ann Arbor, Mayor Christopher Taylor told me 
in an interview. The trees lining our streets 
extend the natural setting of the parks further 
into the city, creating a natural ambiance even 
among neighborhood buildings and roads. 
The trees lining the sides of the city’s streets 
are a poetic continuation of the greenness I 
find in morning walks through the park. This 
green overtone serves to make the entire city 
an attractive and pleasant place. If you’ve 
ever stopped to take in the view from a high 
window, you’ll see that trees dominate and 
the city itself recedes, turning into a mass of 
leaves and branches.

That kind of greenness isn’t found in every 

city, but it can be found here in Ann Arbor, 
in part because the city’s administration and 

residents are committed 
to paying for it. Because 
the city’s urban forest is 
so vast, funding for its 
care sometimes comes out 
of other places as well, 
such as the budget for 
stormwater control.

“I’m very devoted to 

the trees of the city,” 
Taylor 
said. 
“Funding 

them 
is 
something 

that I’m committed to 

making happen.” Those trees, along with city 
parks and other natural areas, such as the 
riverbanks of the Huron, make this a city with 
a changing face as the leaves turn brilliant 
colors and then fade with the seasons.

Now is a great time of year to get away 

from our screens and schoolwork and 
take a moment to really notice the nature 
surrounding and infusing our city, and to 
think about the ways we interact with it. Such 
areas are what make this city unique, and also 
what make it beautiful. So the next time you’re 
feeling stressed, can’t get your head around 
what you need to do or just feel listless and 
de-energized, try taking a walk in one of the 
city’s parks. I’d say that West Park is ideal, but 
any one will do. All of them are full of lovely 
trees and promise a welcome break from the 
crowded heart of downtown. Ann Arbor’s 
parks are there to be used and enjoyed.

— LSA senior Jessica* in an interview with The Michigan Daily on what she was told 
about some of the houses she would visit during Panhellenic Association recruitment.

*Name has been changed to protect identity.

“

NOTABLE QUOTABLE

If I actually ate the cheese and 

crackers in the houses, I would 

never get in.”

A

bout two weeks ago, I had 
a fairly scary incident: I 
was in a Home Depot, a 

place I’d avoided 
at all costs for 
my entire life, 
when it suddenly 
dawned on me 
that I no longer 
hated 
wander-

ing through the 
aisles of hard-
ware 
or 
the 

overbearing 
scent of sawdust. 
Instead, I was 
having 
a 
hor-

rifyingly 
good 

time hunting down the things on 
my roommate’s and my list. This 
revelation 
was 
naturally 
quite 

shocking for me and the ensuing 
identity crisis not only brought me 
to some startling realizations about 
my changing interests and status in 
life, but also made me reflect on my 
time in Home Depot and how bad I 
am at being an adult.

Let me explain: I have recently 

moved into an apartment with a 
friend. In theory, this pseudo-home 
ownership is the lowest possible 
level of accountability I could have 
for my shelter as an adult, other 
than crashing on a series of increas-
ingly unwilling friends’ couches 
(as I plan to do after graduation). 
Renting an apartment and being 
liable for the upkeep should be no 
issue, and yet things seem to go 
wrong all the time. Our first two 
mail keys didn’t work, there are no 
stove plates for our burners — we’ve 
learned to live with letting our 
pots of macaroni rest on 20-degree 
angles — and one night, a glass light 

cover fell from the ceiling while we 
were nowhere near it and shattered, 
filling our carpet with fun, little glass 
shards. Hence the shopping trip.

As a child, I had been dragged 

to Lowe’s and Home Depot nearly 
every other day (this is an exaggera-
tion, but probably not by much) and 
I never enjoyed it. There was noth-
ing to do there while my parents 
discussed types of concrete except 
to push all the different doorbell 
samples. And push them I did.

Shopping for my own home was 

a much different experience than 
that of my childhood. Looking at 
different parts and pieces of equip-
ment was exciting now that it was a 
decorating game. At the same time, 
though, I was revolted and con-
fused with my pleasure in this. How 
had I become this person? How was 
I being such a boring adult, enjoy-
ing myself in a hardware store, 
while also being such a bad adult in 
general, using Febreeze instead of 
doing my laundry?

I realize I’m not supposed to be 

good at being an adult or home-
owner yet; that would be insane, 
since I’ve only had a few years of 
living on my own to have gotten 
the hang of this. However, this is 
allegedly easy mode; there is sup-
posedly every possible safety net 
standing between me and home-
lessness/unemployment/plagues/
aimlessness during college, yet I 
am still very often faced with situ-
ations I feel completely unprepared 
for, such as figuring out how to get 
tiny glass shards out of carpeting, 
or shooing ghosts out of our walls.

What I’m realizing, though, is 

that maybe that’s what it means to 
be an “adult.” Being a grown-up isn’t 

about having answers, it’s about the 
flexibility and resourcefulness that 
comes from using a cleaned-out but-
ter tub as a bowl when all the dishes 
are dirty, or the knowhow that comes 
from past experiences with buying 
lights to tell you that you really can’t 
light an entire apartment with jack-
o-lanterns, controlled bonfires and 
holiday string lights alone.

However, using that kind of criti-

cal thinking is challenging stuff, and 
sometimes I don’t have the brain-
power to handle it. Instead, what I’d 
like to propose is that we, as a soci-
ety, restructure the “traditional” 
order of life and add a new step. After 
high school, I would like to see a new 
stage in which bored, elderly people 
are assigned a young adult and are 
asked to mentor them. And by men-
tor I mean parent. (What I’m really 
trying to say is that I’m terrible at 
this and if someone wants to come 
and run my life for me, that would 
be much appreciated and probably 
for the greater good. I haven’t taken 
out the trash in three weeks.)

Seriously and honestly, I think 

the answer to all of this — the con-
flicting feelings about having adult 
responsibilities with only some of 
the adult mindset — is to remem-
ber that no one really knows what 
they’re doing, even if they claim 
they do and they’re a real “adult” in 
your eyes. Plus, there really is no set 
idea of what an adult is or does, even 
if there seems there might be. So, go 
ahead and enjoy your time in Home 
Depot, but also go ahead and push 
all the doorbell samples. You’ve 
earned it, you beautiful disaster.

TO THE DAILY: 

Thank you to Lev Facher and The Michigan 

Daily for the article, “In the Shadows: 
Campus Co-ingestion.” In July, 2014, as most 
people were enjoying the summer, I was 
burying my son, Josh Levine (Kinesiology 
’14). His death was senseless, needless and 
completely preventable.

When Adderall is combined with alcohol, 

it keeps a person from feeling as drunk as 
their blood alcohol content is registering. 
It also prevents one from passing out if too 
much is consumed. In Josh’s case, he kept 
drinking, feeling fine, until he collapsed, 
brain dead.

Since then, I started the Josh E. Levine 

Foundation 
(www.joshelevinefoundation.

org) to prevent more tragedies through 

awareness, education and action. I can talk 
as a grieving mother, but it is essential to 
incorporate students in the solution. Be 
informed, be an upstander, be more cautious 
when you drink. This movement is not about 
abstinence; it is about being safe.

Our tag line is “it’s fun until …” The 

possibilities are endless: passing out, blacking 
out, MIP, DUI, poor grades, destruction of 
property, being a victim or perpetrator of 
sexual assault. You get the idea.

Please join me and the University in our 

efforts to be a part of the culture shift on 
binge drinking and co-ingestion. It’s a small 
effort to prevent more casualties.

It’s fun until …

‘M’ drops rivalry 
game to Spartans

By TYLER COADY

For the Daily

Having sat on the periphery 

of the national rankings all 
season, Michigan State came into 
Wednesday 
night’s 
matchup 
against 
Michigan with a point to prove.

After the Spartans’ victory 

over Michigan (1-2 Big Ten, 11-3 
overall), they left Jenison Field 
House in East Lansing with little 
doubt they should be nationally 
ranked.

Led by outside hitters Alyssa 

Garvelink and Brooke Kranda, 
Michigan State (2-1, 10-4) proved 
adept at controlling play around 
the net and began to flex its 
muscles in the second set. The 
duo combined to record 18 kills in 
the match.

“We knew (Michigan State) is 

a good team, and there were no 
surprises going into this game,” 
said Michigan coach Mark Rosen. 
“We knew what they were going 
to do, but their execution was 
better in the latter stages of each 
set.”

Both teams came out strong 

in the first set, as both eyed 
their second Big Ten win of the 
season. The Wolverines, playing 
in a hostile atmosphere, silenced 
the crowd early behind some 
dominant play by sophomore 
outside hitter Adeja Lambert, 
who recorded 10 kills in the 
match. With a 16-14 lead in the 
set, the Wolverines looked poised 
to hang on and take the set. But 
two Michigan State aces and a 
barrage of difficult serves allowed 

the Spartans to build momentum 
and then eventually take a 1-0 
lead in the match.

As the second set progressed, 

Michigan State continued to 
pull away from Michigan, as the 
Spartans forced the Wolverines 
into 
numerous 
mistakes. 

Michigan, despite some strong 
play toward the end of the set, 
couldn’t muster enough offensive 
chances to threaten the Spartans.

“We did a good job early on, 

and we were consistent in our 
execution,” 
Rosen 
said. 
“As 

the sets went on, our passing 
deteriorated, (Michigan State) 
kept improving, and we realized 
that we need to work better 
together.”

In the third set, Michigan 

came out strong, looking to stay 
alive. Lambert notched another 
kill while senior middle blocker 
Krystalyn 
Goode 
racked 
up 

three of her own, helping the 
Wolverines to a quick 12-7 lead. 
But just as quickly as it took 
back the first set, Michigan State 
regained the form that saw it 
dominate the second set. Over the 
next several minutes, back-and-
forth play dominated the game. 
With the scoreboard reading 
21-21, Michigan State put its 
foot on the throttle, closing out 
Michigan and winning the next 
four points to clinch the victory.

With a rematch scheduled for 

Saturday in Ann Arbor, Rosen 
knows his team needs to improve.

“We need to compete better,” 

Rosen said. ”When we are leading 
late in the game we need to be 
more consistent in all aspects 
of the game, offensively and 
defensively.”

VOLLEYBALL
Murillo returns as leader

Senior captain 

steps in seamlessly 

on ‘M’ defense

By BETELHEM ASHAME

Daily Sports Writer

Good players are adept at 

catching up quickly to make up 
for lost time after injury or other 
circumstances, but great players 
possess the ability to take an 
extended period of time off 
without missing a beat.

Michigan senior captain and 

defender Christina Murillo is 
in a category all her own after 
taking the entire 2014 season 
off to train with the Mexican 
National Team in preparation 
for the 2015 FIFA Women’s 
World Cup. It didn’t take her 
long to return to her position as 
an integral part of the Michigan 
women’s soccer team.

“It was an instant, perfect fit,” 

said Michigan coach Greg Ryan. 
“It’s like when you put on a shoe 
and it’s just right — that was 
Christina Murillo on our back 
line. From day one, she’s done a 
great job of not only fitting in but 
also leading the rest of the team. 
If this was her first year, it would 
have taken longer, but since she 
knew all of the girls and played 
with them, it was seamless and 
effortless.”

Murillo credits the team’s 

response to her return and the 
experience she gained from 
national team training as key 
factors in her reintroduction to 
the rhythm of Michigan.

“It’s been fairly easy because 

of how the team has welcomed 
me back with open arms,” 
Murillo said. “In terms of 

school, it’s actually a lot easier 
to manage now because World 
Cup training is an environment 
where 
everything 
is 
about 

discipline and schedules. So 
I’ve been using the skills I’ve 
developed, where I incorporate 
a set time for everything, which 
allows me to be able to focus 
more at practice and be a better 
player at Michigan.”

As the leader of a defense that 

has produced four shutouts this 
season — including two in which 
it allowed just 11 shots combined 
against Nebraska and Iowa last 
weekend — Murillo was named 
Big Ten Defensive Player of the 
Week.

“Every time I’m playing, I’m 

doing whatever I can to help the 
team win that game,” Murillo 
said. “Our goal on defense is 
always to allow the least amount 
of shots, so I can really attribute 
our success as a defensive line to 
all four of us. It’s not just me, it’s 
the discipline of other starting 
players as well, so I’m just lucky 
to be in that defensive line.

“I don’t know if I necessarily 

deserve (it), because we wouldn’t 
have gotten those shutouts if 
it wasn’t for the other three 
players on our 
back line.”

Despite 

her 
modesty, 

Ryan 
fully 

recognizes the 
central 
role 

Murillo plays 
on the team.

“She 

definitely 
makes it all 
work at the 
back,” Ryan said. “She knows 
how to coordinate everyone, 
so she’s definitely the leader 
and organizer back there. She’s 

essentially the coach on the 
field, giving direction to the 
attack.”

In addition 

to 
her 

defensive 
prowess, 
Murillo is a 
key cog and 
frequent 
contributor on 
the 
offensive 

side 
of 
the 

ball, recording 
two assists in 
the 
opening 

weekend of Big Ten play.

“In the modern game of soccer, 

the way most teams are playing, 
your centerbacks touch the ball 

more than any other players,” 
Ryan said. “So when you have a 
centerback like Christina, who’s 
not only very comfortable with 
the ball in possession but who 
can also make those penetrating 
passes and create assists, you 
want her to have the ball as often 
as possible.”

Whenever a team loses an 

important player, there’s always 
a ripple effect on the mood 
and character of the rest of the 
team. The same is true when 
an important player returns to 
the fold. With the way Murillo 
is 
playing 
right 
now, 
the 

Wolverines couldn’t be happier 
to have her back in maize and 
blue for her senior season.

Shields brings experience 
as new goaltenders coach

Former Wolverine 
played for six NHL 
teams, won 100-
plus games for ‘M’

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

While the rest of the Michigan 

hockey 
team 
was 
running 

through a power-play drill on 
Tuesday, the goaltenders were 
in their own corner of the rink 
working on distribution. 

Goaltending 
coach 
Steve 

Shields 
was 
putting 
them 

through fundamental drills of 
their own, using every minute 
he has while the coaches adhere 
to the two-hour weekly NCAA 
limitation, which lasts until 
Sunday.

Such a practice hasn’t been 

common for goaltenders Steve 
Racine (a senior) and Zach 
Nagelvoort (a junior), given that 
former goaltender coach Josh 
Blackburn could only commit to 
being on the ice with them two 
days a week last season.

Now, 
with 
the 
addition 

of 
Shields, 
the 
Wolverine 

netminders will be coached 
every day of the week, an 
opportunity 
that 
Michigan 

coach Red Berenson believes 
could drastically impact Racine 
and Nagelvoort’s performance.

Shields, 
who 
joined 
the 

coaching staff in May, is a 
former 
Michigan 
goaltender 

who made four straight NCAA 
Tournament appearances from 
1990 to 1994. He was a two-time 
All-American and the first at his 
position to reach 100 wins in 
NCAA history.

After he hung up the maize 

and blue sweater for the last 
time, Shields went on to play for 
six NHL teams.

And now that Shields’ playing 

days are over, his new goaltending 
apprentices are enthusiastic to 
learn from both his collegiate 
and NHL experience.

“(Blackburn 
and 
Shields) 

know what they did, what 
worked and what didn’t work, 
so I can trust what they’re 
saying,” Nagelvoort said. “Now 

having (Shields), he was really 
successful and had a great 
career. I just feel that much 
better having him on the ice. I 
have that much more faith in 
what he’s telling me, and I’m 
that much more comfortable 
with him.”

Added Racine: “Anytime you 

can get a guy like that helping 
you out, you value everything he 
says. Going forward, it’s going 
to be amazing just having him 
there every day. No days off. No 
days where we can kind of hide 
between certain things. He’s 
always going be there to critique 
us and tell us what we’re doing 
right and wrong. That’s just a 
great thing to have.”

Nagelvoort 
and 
Racine’s 

statistics were relatively similar 
last season as they split time in 
the net. Nagelvoort posted a 2.63 
goals-against 
average, 
.906 
save 

percentage 
and 
finished 

with 
an 

11-9 
record, 

while 
Racine 

recorded 
a 

2.94 
goals-

against 
average 
with 

a 
.908 
save 

percentage and an 11-6 record.

But despite their respectable 

statistics, both goaltenders went 
through slumps and struggled 
with inconsistency — an aspect 
that Shields noted. He has set out 
to bring the best attributes out of 
Nagelvoort and Racine on a day-
to-day basis by simplifying the 
goaltending process and forcing 
them to take a mathematical, 
rather than personal, approach 
to their mistakes.

“What I’ve tried to do with 

them is to strip everything down 
and not personalize everything. 
I want them to be able to go back 
and look at video of themselves, 
and take it on as sort of a math 
problem,” Shields said. “They’re 
just solving a problem. There’s 
no emotion in it. There’s no 
second thoughts about ‘how 
I played this, we lost a game 
because I did this.’ If we can take 
the stuff that they’ve done and 
look at it honestly, and say, ‘Well 

I can do this better and I can’t do 
that,’ then they’ll improve.”

Shields has said that his 

biggest responsibility as the 
new goaltending coach is to hold 
his players accountable every 
day they go on the ice or in the 
weight room. But in order to do 
that, he feels he first has to build 
a unique relationship with each 
goalie.

He’s inherited that philosophy 

from his own experience in the 
NHL, where he was first exposed 
to a goalie coach who was critical 
of him every day and was honest 
about his performances — but 
only after the two established a 
relationship.

By creating that rapport, 

Shields is trying to provide the 
Wolverines’ netminders with a 
unique experience he only got at 
the professional level.

In 
the 

simplest sense, 
each goalie has 
a metaphorical 
checklist, and 
Shields 
puts 

it on his own 
shoulders 
to 

make 
sure 

they 
check 

those 
boxes 

as the season 
progresses.

Shields has taken the first 

steps in that direction by having 
conversations with Nagelvoort, 
Racine 
and 
freshman 
Chad 

Catt in the spring. He had ideas 
about where the goaltenders 
could each improve simply from 
watching Michigan the past 
two years, and he constructed a 
program specific to each goalie 
that focuses on improving their 
weaknesses.

And while the Wolverine 

netminders 
hope 
to 
have 

breakout seasons under Shields’ 
instruction, 
he 
recognizes 

the 
progress 
won’t 
happen 

overnight.

Offensive line relishes improvement in 2015

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

In last week’s game against 

Brigham Young, the Michigan 
football 
team’s 
offensive 

line walked up to the line of 
scrimmage and saw something it 
had been waiting to see for a long 
time.

The Wolverines looked across 

and saw the Cougars’ defense 
sweating and panting, with hands 
on hips from sheer exhaustion.

Michigan’s offensive line has 

taken a bulk of the criticism 
for rough seasons in 2013 and 
2014, and in that time, they were 
usually the ones in the position 
the Cougars found themselves in 
on Saturday.

“We haven’t really had much 

of that in the recent past, but it’s 
an awesome feeling knowing 
that when you go up to the line 
of scrimmage, you’re looking 
into a guy’s eyes (and) you know 

you have him beat already,” said 
redshirt junior guard Kyle Kalis 
on Monday. “That’s something 
that we haven’t had. We have 
it now in full effect, and it feels 
good.”

Another 
benefit 
comes 
in 

the form of big plays, of which 
Michigan has had many in 
the run game. Junior running 
back De’Veon Smith’s 60-yard 
touchdown 
run 
Saturday 

provided one such highlight.

Smith did most of the heavy 

lifting on that particular run, but 
Kalis sprung ahead and was the 
first lineman into the end zone to 
celebrate, quickly joined by four 
other players.

“It’s nice,” Kalis said. “It’s the 

reason why we’re all here. It’s 
the reason why I came here, the 
reason why a lot of guys came 
here. When I saw him in the end 
zone and embraced him, that was 
a good moment for both of us. It 
just feels good. It’s the way it’s 

supposed to be.”

The Wolverines have begun 

to taste more of those rewards 
this year as they have shown 
improvement. They went three-
and-out 
on 

their 
first 

possession 
Saturday 
but 

then 
went 

to 
work 
and 

scored on their 
next five (four 
touchdowns 
and 
a 
field 

goal) to take a 
commanding 
31-0 lead.

In those five drives, they 

gained 344 yards on 38 plays, 
spanning 18:23. For the game, 
they possessed the ball for 38:38, 
wearing out BYU’s defense to the 
point of submission.

“If you go get a play and 

you pancake somebody, your 
adrenaline is going through the 

roof, so that carries into the next 
play,” Kalis said. “The next play, 
if you do good, more adrenaline, 
and it keeps carrying on. That’s 
how you develop an identity, just 

having 
good 

plays over and 
over again.”

After 
the 

past two years, 
Michigan’s line 
had to build 
its 
reputation 

little by little. 
After all, the 
Wolverines’ 
domination 
of BYU came 

three weeks after a 24-17 road 
loss to Utah in which they rushed 
for just 76 yards.

Part of that progress can be 

attributed to Tim Drevno, the 
team’s offensive line coach and 
offensive coordinator, whom head 
coach Jim Harbaugh brought 
from Southern California in the 

offseason. Kalis said Monday 
that the current linemen — many 
of whom made up the line last 
year — had made good plays in 
the past, but not all together and 
not often enough. This year, they 
have come together as a unit.

“I think as you go through 

game to game, you get used 
to 
everybody 
and 
how 
you 

communicate 
and 
how 
they 

handle adversity and you get to 
know one another,” Drevno said. 
“That’s part of the process of 
trusting one another. The quicker 
you can trust, the quicker you 
have success, so I think that’s 
been a real big part of where we 
are today.

“It’s gradual. They get used 

to your coaching techniques 
and how you coach and how you 
prepare and what you demand 
from them. It’s just them getting 
to know you, you getting to know 
them — and the quicker you can 
do that, the quicker you have 

success.”

The line has come along 

smoothly for Michigan, without 
many issues along the way. The 
Wolverines have rushed for more 
than 200 yards in every game 
since Utah and allowed just three 
sacks on the season. Eight teams 
have allowed fewer in the same 
number of games.

Drevno was hard on his unit 

after a lackluster performance 
against the Utes, but he and 
Harbaugh 
haven’t 
been 
shy 

about singing the offensive line’s 
praises as it has improved. They 
grade each player after every 
game and note the improvement.

“That’s definitely an awesome 

feeling,” 
Kalis 
said 
of 
the 

encouragement. 
“That’s 
fun. 

That’s why you play. It’s to get the 
respect of your brothers, to get 
the respect of your coaches and 
look good playing out there. Just 
have fun. That’s why you play the 
game of football.”

good. It’s

Jake Butt (#88) and A.J. Williams (#84) play critical roles for Michigan, which has made good use of its tight ends.
Chemistry key for tight ends

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

If you ask tight end A.J. 

Williams, his position group 
is a cast of characters, all with 
different 
personalities 
and 

backgrounds.

He 
mentions 
redshirt 

sophomore Henry Poggi, a recent 
convert to the position, with 
his “crazy flow,” and redshirt 
sophomore Khalid Hill, who 
just 
returned 
from 
anterior 

cruciate ligament surgery and 
until recently had a haircut that 
Williams described as a box.

Add in junior Jake Butt, 

the star with the funny last 
name; redshirt freshman Ian 
Bunting, who tight ends coach 
Jay Harbaugh says “looks like 
a big tree”; and Williams, the 
senior who has been a blocking 
specialist for the last three years, 
and the Wolverines have quite a 
deep and diverse tight end group.

And those are just the players 

who caught a pass in Michigan’s 
win against Brigham Young on 
Saturday.

Playing tight end for Michigan 

feels different this year, Williams 
said Tuesday. He has been in 
offenses where tight ends have 
been 
overlooked, 
particularly 

in his primary role of blocking. 
But when Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh arrived last December, 
Williams and his position mates 
knew they were in for a treat. 

During his tenure at Stanford, 
Harbaugh was known for his 
development 
of 
tight 
ends, 

most notably Zach Ertz and 
Coby Fleener, both significant 
contributors in the NFL.

Michigan’s tight ends want to 

get there some day, Williams said, 
and they rely on one another to 
achieve their goals. Studying the 
playbook is nearly a constant — 
even on group trips to Chipotle. 
If any of the players ever feels as 
though Michigan’s playbook is 
too long or too in-depth to study, 
they are reminded that it will be 
even more so in the NFL.

“We have a group text, which 

is constantly going, and we 
communicate,” Williams said. 
“I know certain people, we like 
to hang out, we’ll watch football 
together all the time, watch tight 
ends in the NFL who we want to 
advance our game to.”

Williams 
thinks 
that 

Harbaugh’s age — he is just 26 
years old — is a benefit to the 
unit, laughing at the notion that 
Harbaugh 
would 
have 
been 

a senior in high school when 
Williams was in seventh grade. 
But still, he has no problems 
listening to a coach who is less 
than five years his senior.

“Coach Jay is wise beyond his 

years,” Williams said.

Harbaugh does not believe his 

age really helps him coach his 
unit.

“I mean, certain references 

and all that I get that maybe are 
over other guys’ heads, but I just 
think that that’s kind of a little bit 
overrated,” Jay Harbaugh said. 
“But that’s just my opinion.”

Where Harbaugh does agree 

with Williams, though, is that 
watching and learning from the 
NFL can be a key to Michigan’s 
success. Harbaugh had spent the 
last three seasons working with 
his uncle, John Harbaugh, as an 
offensive quality control coach 
for the Baltimore Ravens.

Michigan’s style of offense, 

Harbaugh said, is more similar 
to those of NFL offenses than 
other college offenses. He studies 
film of NFL teams he believes use 
tight ends well to improve his own 
unit, including the Kansas City 
Chiefs, the Carolina Panthers and 
the New England Patriots.

As it continues to develop 

over the course of the season, 
Harbaugh’s unit will have its 
opportunities.

“I think we’ve thrown the 

ball eight times per game to my 
group, and I don’t think anyone 
else is that high in the country,” 
Harbaugh said. “I don’t think 
anyone else is even close.”

MICHIGAN 
GOSPEL 
CHORALE


2B — Thursday, October 1, 2015

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Around 7 p.m. in the Trotter 

Multicultural Center, the first 
few members of the Michigan 
Gospel Chorale (MGC) begin 
to arrive. One student heads 
directly to the piano and starts 
to play. More members enter as 
music fills the room, building 
an energy that’s warm and open 
to all who walk in. Excitement 
comes as each 
new 
per-

son 
arrives 

at 
practice, 

bringing 
their 
own 

unique voice 
to the chorus.

“It’s 
very 

informal, you 
come 
and 

you’re 
wel-

comed 
into 

the 
group 

automati-
cally, 
like 

people 
are 

really excited 
to meet new 
people, 
to 

bring 
them 

into the com-
munity, 
and 

I knew that 
it would be a 
big part of my 
time 
here,” 

said 
Phillip 

Hargrove, an Engineering grad-
uate student and MGC assistant 
director.

In an interview with The 

Michigan 
Daily, 
Hargrove, 

along with LSA senior Lawrielle 
West, MGC president, Nursing 
junior Brianna Hawkins, MGC 
secretary and Shakia Jackson, 
Rackham graduate student and 
MGC adviser, emphasized the 
importance for him to find such 
a group when he first came to 
Michigan as a graduate student 
after completing his undergrad 
at Stanford University. 

“This was a big challenge for 

me, coming out to a region of 
the country where I don’t have 
any family,” Hargrove said, “I 
felt like I’d be out on my own so 
it was real important to connect 
to a community of other people 
who love God and are excited 
about God and enjoy the same 
kind of things I do in terms 
of that. That was how I got 
involved, just came in and it’s 
been a great part of my experi-
ence.”

The chorale, which origi-

nated in 1972 as the University 
of Michigan 
Black 
Gos-

pel Choir, is 
a 
nonprofit 

organiza-
tion 
that 

encompasses 
not just the 
choir 
but 

also 
several 

auxiliaries 
including 
a 

mime 
team, 

the 
dance 

oriented 
I.O.P (Imag-
es of Praise), 
the sign lan-
guage group 
H.A.N.D.S 
(Hands 
Anointed ‘N 
Divine Signs) 
and the spo-
ken 
word 

T.R.U.S.T 
(Taking Ref-
uge Utter Spoken Truth). The 
diversity of performance types 
gives students several opportu-
nities to express themselves.

“I feel that they cater to 

everyone,” Hawkins said, ref-
erencing the role of the auxil-
iaries, “Like at our concerts, so 
someone that’s deaf can’t hear 
our songs but they’re able to see 
the sign language. Or someone 
who enjoys hearing singing but 
when they see a dance, they’re 
moved by the dancing. It caters 
to everyone and gives an overall 
experience at our concerts.”

“One of the great things about 

MGC is that we don’t require 
auditions for any of our auxilia-
ries or our choir,” Jackson said. 
“So for people to become mem-
bers they just have to show up 
and sing, mime, sign language 
or whatever they like to do. So 
when I joined MGC, I joined 
the day before a concert that we 
had, our College Night Concert, 
which occurs every January. I 
joined the night before and then 
over the night I learned the 
songs and got up there and sang 
with the choir the next day.”

Jackson, who has been with 

the chorale since her sopho-
more year as an undergradu-
ate and calls herself the group 
mother, echoed Hargrove’s sen-
timent of belonging.

“The choir members were so 

welcoming to me. I felt I had a 
family, some people who did 
care about me, and though I was 
a new member I didn’t feel as 
though I was an outsider or that 
I wasn’t able to contribute to 
the organization or the minis-

try,” she said. “They completely 
welcomed me and made me feel 
as though I had a purpose here 
and I can be here and sing and 
do whatever it is I wanted to do 
and so that’s what really made 
me want to stick with MGC.”

Uniting many participants in 

MGC is their Christian faith, as 
practice begins and the piano 
music dies down, the members 
form a circle for prayer. Hold-
ing hands, they thank God for 
the opportunity to be together 
and use their gifts and share in 
their faith, a core idea behind 
the organization.

“I think the mission is just 

to spread the Gospel of God 
but also just the love of Gospel 
music, so you don’t even have 
to be religious or attached to 
a certain faith to enjoy Gospel 
music,” West said.

The 
interwoven 
nature 

between faith and Gospel music 
shows itself in nearly every 
aspect of the group as they 
warm up to the song, “Draw Me 
Close to You/ Thy Will be Done” 
by Pastor Marvin Winans.

“Thy will be done/ Lord in 

me/ In me/ Because I see you 
work in others and I want you to 
work in me,” the group sings as 
West takes on directing duties 
for the practice.

“Something I really appreci-

ated about MGC was how the 
group is never afraid to tackle 
any song,” Hargrove said in 
regards to his experience sing-
ing for MGC. “I think I’m theo-
retically a better singer now 
than I was last year.”

As West guides the group 

through the popular Gospel 
song, “Even Me,” she stops and 
tells her fellow vocalists to sing 
out, to share their voice with 
God. West, who first came to 
the organization after receiving 
a direct message from MGC’s 
Twitter account inviting her to 
join, relates the words to faith, 
emphasizing the passion behind 
each verse, and the chorale 
responds accordingly.

“Lord, I hear of showers of 

blessings/ Thou art scattering full 
and free/ Showers of thirst souls 
refreshing/ Let some drops now 
fall on me.”

Helping MGC find this connec-

tion to their faith and each other is 
weekly Bible study.

“Once our spirit is out of whack 

everything is out of whack. Our 
songs don’t sound good, we arrive 
to things late, it’s kind of off. With 
the Bible studies it allows us to be 
on one accord about the things 
that we’re talking about,” Jackson 
said. “We’re focusing on a certain 
theme or certain scripture and 
through that we grow closer to one 
another ‘cause we’re all in tune 
with God and that puts us all into it 

as a ministry. 
Without the 
Bible 
stud-

ies, 
without 

the 
actual 

spiritual part 
we are just 
an organiza-
tion.”

The MGC 

isn’t 
just 

complacent 
in 
sharing 

their refined 
performanc-
es and belief 
within 
just 

the group, but 
also take part 
in an annual 
mission tour 
that 
takes 

them across 
the 
country 

where 
they 

perform and 
volunteer.

“Tour 
is 

during Spring Break, so we are 
already taking that commitment to 
not go party and go out. But to have 
this not only spiritual experience 
but this experience with people 
who love each other, we’re actu-
ally friends and this is such a great 
bonding experience. Once you go 
on tour, you’ll have memories for a 
lifetime,” West said.

“It’s amazing to go to like a 

church in Texas, where many of 
us don’t know the people at the 
church but we can all sing the 
same songs and the same worship 
experience,” Hawkins added about 
the tour that has had stops in states 
like Ohio, Kentucky and Florida, 
among others.

In addition to the tour, members 

of MGC finds themselves singing 
at churches and campus functions 
including Maize Night Madness 
and the Fireside Café on North 
Campus. The group also puts on 
performances at New Life Church, 
including their spring concert, 
which last year saw the choir 
unexpectedly perform without 
accompaniment when the musi-
cians didn’t show up.

These local events form a 

presence 
within 
the 

community 
that allows 
MGC 
to 

serve anoth-
er role. 

“I 
think 

it offers an 
outlet, a spir-
itual outlet,” 
Hawkins 
said. 
“I 

feel 
people 

come to our 
concerts 
and 
feel 

like they’re 
able to go 
to 
church 

if 
they 

don’t 
have 

a 
church 

home here. 
People come 
to us and can 
ask us for 

prayer and come to us and be like, 
‘Oh my goodness, it’s like I’m back 
at home.’ ”

As practice ends, the mem-

bers gather around in prayer one 
last time. Before they leave they 
each give another a hug goodbye. 
There’s a bond among the chorale, 
joined together by talent and faith.

“That’s just the beginning of 

something great, feeling like you’re 
welcome into a community, they 
are not only OK with you being 
there but they want you there, they 
need you there,” West said.

With their first event this Sat-

urday at Pastor Winan’s Perfecting 
Church, the group looks forward 
to spreading their message, as 
described by West.

“Gospel is based off faith and 

having a relationship with God, 
but also another part is being this 
inspiration movement — music to 
give you hope and faith to carry on. 
Every song we sing has meaning 
with us because a lot of us, not all of 
us, are Christians and so the songs 
we sing have meaning because it’s 
about God pulling us through or 
God’s going to pull us through or 
God has pulled us through.”

SINGLE REVIEW

 Picture an inexplicably 
smoky, dimly lit basement of 
some good friend’s parents 
house 
in some 
sector of 
Midwestern 
suburbia. 
The room 
is filled 
with angsty 
high school 
seniors, 
making out on ragged couches, 
getting high, listening to 
your friend’s older brother’s 
band perform while someone 
discusses the details of 
their “next big move.” This 
incredibly archetypal setting is 
reminiscent of a John Hughes 
film, or the pages of the next 
box-office hit screenplay by 
Scott Neustadter and Michael 
H. Weber. Yet here it can be 
used to reflect another art form 
entirely. Here, the imagery 
of this quintessentially high 
school moment reflects the sonic 
simplicity emerging from Alex 
G’s new single, “Kicker.”
 The classically minimalist 
musician allows his guitar 
to occupy the sonic space on 
“Kicker.” Despite the song’s 

bummed-out lyrics and 
monotonous tone, the versatile 
character of Alex G’s guitar 
engages the listener from 
start to finish. At “Kicker” ’s 
crescendo, where one sustained 
screech of G’s guitar carries 
the song into its five-second 
denouement, we’re transported 
to that smoky basement. Those 
post-puberty almost adults are 
occupying the space where 
Alex G is playing. They’re 
bobbing their heads along, 
understanding of the great 

simplicity that his music holds. 
“Heaven, maybe freedom, 
what’s the word / Right, I 
forgot, quiet is the closest 
thing we got,” he sings, and the 
crowd’s slow head-bob feels 
almost tangible. The track ends 
too quickly, closing in on just 
under three minutes. Alex G’s 
performance reflects what he 
has perfected: expansive guitars 
and angsty lyrics to satisfy the 
smoky basements in the back of 
all of our minds.

The Michigan Gospel Chorale rehearses at Trotter Multicultural Center, Tuesday.

By HAILEY MIDDLEBROOK

Daily Health Columnist

This summer I interned 

with Running Times magazine, 
which is the smaller, quieter, 
more intense brother of Run-
ner’s World, Men’s Health and 
Women’s Health magazines. 
The internship took place in 
Emmaus, Pa., where the Rodale 
publishing company head-
quarters are located — a tiny, 
organic- 
enthused, active town 

about an hour away from New 
York City and Philadelphia.

Naturally, the place is packed 

with fitness nuts, granola geeks 
and muscle heads. It’s awesome. 
Employees (and interns) are 
encouraged to take bike rides 
or run at lunch, buy meals at 
the organic cafeteria, promo 
running shoes and yoga mats 
and attend free fitness classes at 
Rodale’s state 
-of- 
the- 
art gym. 

The company motto, “Live your 
whole life,” is taken to heart by 
its employees — a wholesome, 
healthy lifestyle is truly what 
they practice and preach.

So when I met my roommate 

for the summer, an intern for 
Runner’s World, I was taken 
by surprise. I walked into 
our shared dorm room in the 
middle of a workout video, 
my 
new 
roommate 
splayed 

on a yoga mat in the center of 
the floor, holding a slightly 
sagging plank pose. Nothing 
out of the ordinary. I skirted 
around her, plopped my bags 
on the nostalgic twin XL bed 
and pulled on my running 
shoes, bracing myself for the 
East coast humidity. I asked my 
roommate, now clearly in the 
cool 
-down phase of her tape, 

what workout she was doing.

She promptly began to tell 

me about the “21 Day Fix.” 
Which, unfortunately, I would 
continue to hear about for the 
next 21 days. To save you the 
lengthy explanation — trust me, 
if there’s one thing people love 
to drone on about, it’s their lat-
est diet — here’s the 21 Day Fix 
in a nutshell: three weeks of 
daily, half- 
hour workout tapes 

and seven color 
-coded food 

containers.

The food containers are key. 

According to Beachbody, the 
mastermind behind the Fix, the 
reason diets go awry is because 
dieters don’t judge portion 
sizes correctly. To eliminate 
this problem, they’ve created 
containers of varying size that 
hold the “precise” amount of 
fruits, 
vegetables, 
protein, 

carbs, fats, seeds and dressing 
that you need in a day. The color 
of the container signifies what 
goes inside — the (relatively) 
hefty 
green 
container 
is 

for vegetables, whereas the 
thimble 
-sized orange container 

is for dressing. Basically, you 
“fill them up as directed in the 
Eating Plan, and you will lose 
the weight!” At least that’s what 
Autumn Calabrese, the manic 
Fix coach, promises.

But wait — there’s more. 

Think you can stuff a piece 
of bread in the yellow carb 
container? 
Think 
again. 

The containers give you the 
“freedom” to fill ‘em up as you 
wish, but if the food doesn’t fit 
... it won’t make you fit. This 
means no bread, no snack bars 
and no beer — or really any 
drink, other than water and 
morning 
breakfast 
shakes. 

Certainly no eating out. And 
once your container quota is met 
for the day, don’t try to sneak 
anything more. (Once, when my 
roommate was groaning about 
hunger, I mistakenly suggested 
eating an apple; she angrily 
replied that she had no more 
red containers left.)

As you can imagine, the 21 

Day Fix makes it difficult to 
make plans. Sunday trips to 
the farmer’s market turned 
into exhausting rants from my 
roommate on how she couldn’t 
buy the fresh pies (because, 
have you heard, I’m on the Fix), 
triggering more than a few 
rolled eyes. I’d come home from 
my usual eight 
-mile run to cook 

dinner, only to have her leering 
over my shoulder, eying my 
chicken and veggie stir fry with 
contempt. Then she’d quit the 
room altogether, claiming that 
she’d eaten all of her containers 
for the day and might as well go 
to bed.

I think I began counting 

down the days until the Fix’s 
finish more voraciously than 
she did. At its sweet, sweet end, 
my roommate did a final weigh- 
in: in 21 days, she’d lost eight 
pounds, but nary an inch from 
her waistline. I congratulated 
her on the loss, but waited 
warily for the weight to creep 
back — as it does, time and time 
again, for whom I call “quick 
fix” dieters.

The “instant gratification” 

phenomenon 
has 
been 

beaten into our heads, but 
it applies to diets too. Our 
culture perpetuates it — how 
many magazine covers have 
screamed, “Get Your Bikini 
Bod Now!” or “Bombshell Butt 
Fast!?” Summer means beach 
season; winter means fitting 
into that party dress.There’s 
no shame in wanting to look 
good, stat. The shame is that 
too many people only aim for 
the “stat” factor — immediate 
results — and set themselves up 
for long- 
term frustration and 

even serious bodily harm.

Here’s the bottom line: the 

pounds you lose on a quick- 
fix 

diet are primarily muscle and 
water weight. Yes, the number 
on the scale is lower, but that 
doesn’t mean you’re more fit — 
and it definitely doesn’t mean 
you’ll stay that weight for long, 
largely because of lost muscle.

“Metabolism” is a buzzword 

that gets thrown around often 
in weight loss discussion (“I 
have a slow metabolism” is 
a 
popular 
explanation 
for 

stubborn excess weight), but it 
comes into play here. The Mayo 
Clinic defines metabolism as 
“the process by which your 
body converts what you eat and 
drink into energy”; that energy 
is then used for basic body 
functioning (breathing, blood 
circulation, cell repairs) and 
physical activity.

When calories are drastically 

restricted, 
metabolism 

shuts 
down 
and 
becomes 

less efficient. Think of a car 
running on empty: you’re slow 
to react, have less power on the 
highway and run the risk of 
damaging your engine. Without 
the necessary proteins and 
nutrients to perform basic body 
functions, your body breaks 
down muscles for fuel. Muscle 
burns more calories than fat, so 
muscle loss is linked to a slower 
metabolism — which makes it 
even harder to keep the weight 
off than before the diet began.

Of course, metabolism isn’t 

the only factor in determining 
weight loss. Across the board, 
experts agree that a combina-
tion of exercise and (proper) 
diet are crucial to maintaining 
a healthy body. Remember that 
energy is also used for physical 
activity — the more you exer-
cise, the more calories you burn 
and the more muscle you build, 
which then promotes a faster 
metabolic rate.

The real secret to a lasting 

beach body? Making healthy 
habits. Find an exercise you like 
— maybe it’s running, maybe it’s 
a workout video — and stick to 
it. Eat balanced meals, making 
sure to fill up on protein and 
vitamin- 
rich vegetables, like a 

spinach omelette with grilled 
chicken. Work to eliminate 
processed 
food 
from 
your 

diet, but do so gradually. Your 
health doesn’t need a 21 
-day 

“fix,” but rather steady, positive 
improvement.

And please, for everyone’s 

sake, eat an apple if you’re 
hungry.

Daily Arts Writer

“(Music) is definitely a lifetime 

commitment, for sure. It’s very 
rewarding and very risky. But I’m 
so glad that I took this career path, 
it’s been so amazing.”

Fans 
around 
the 
world 

would agree that Annakalmia 
Traver made the right career 
choice. This commitment to 
music started at the University 
of Vermont, where the band 
Rubblebucket’s founders, Alex 
Toth and lead singer Traver, met. 
The pair was very involved with 
the arts on campus and, as music 
majors, Toth and Traver spread 
their musical net far and wide.

“We just played tons of music 

together … Burlington, Vt. has 
an awesome music scene and 
we really grew up as musicians 
there,” Traver said during a 
phone 
interview 
with 
The 

Michigan Daily.

After their time in Vermont, 

Toth and Traver took their talents 
to Boston, where they combined 
forces with future bandmates 
Adam Dotson and Ian Hersey. It is 
there that the group was able to put 
down its roots and grow, gathering 
inspiration and getting situated in 
the musical world. 

“Boston is where Rubble-

bucket really became a thing,” 

Traver said.

The group spent much of their 

time in the Northeast touring — 
leaping at every opportunity to 
play anywhere and everywhere, 
to codify their soundscape. This 
extensive touring allowed the band 
to become accustomed to, and 
learn to love, the routine rhythm 
of the road as well as to make 
treasured 
human 
connections 

with fans and fellow musicians.

“Between the core four of us, 

our taste is universal, almost,” 
Traver said. “I started out, when 
I was in middle school, with Boyz 
II Men, Mariah Carey, Toni Brax-
ton — the pop of that era — which 

has really come to stand up strong 
over time.”

These pop influences show 

themselves in the group’s dance-
friendly sound, as well in their 
resonant, stick-in-your-head-for-
days choruses. Taking these pop 
basics and running with them, 
Rubblebucket manages to take the 
best elements of dance music and 
infuse them with a more quirky, 
indie sound — creating a vibe 
entirely their own.

“One of my family members 

gave me a jazz tape, I think it was 
John Coltrane and Charlie Parker. 
And that was really transformative 
for me, and for the other guys 

ARTIST
PROFILE

IN

too. Jazz is an extremely huge 
foundation 
for 
the 
spirit 
of 

improvising,” Traver said.

The implications of this jazz 

fixation on Rubblebucket’s music 
are obvious — the horns, the 
complex layering of different 
instruments, the soulful, honest 
intonation of Traver’s voice. This 
jazz-inspired 
element 
puts 
a 

syncopated swing in everything 
that the group does, something 
that many indie bands lack.

“Through knowing the guys, 

my band mates, I got into more 
rock ‘n’ roll, which I really couldn’t 
have told you anything about when 
I was in high school. It has been a 
cool education.”

Drawing on their mirage 

of 
taste, 
training 
in 
brass 

instruments and other inspiring 
artists, Rubblebucket crafted 
their 
distinct 
genre-bending 

sound. 
This 
rock 
influence 

comes into play in the form 
of the band’s swagger — their 
attitude. Their music is dance-
friendly with a touch of punk, hip 
with an edgy essence.

“We are definitely suited to the 

indie world, particularly the dance 
side of things,” Traver said. “There 

is definitely an element of DIY, that 
sort of punk spirit, in everything 
that we do. ”

Taking a turn off the beaten 

path, Rubblebucket incorporates 
horns into much of their work — 
a choice that many modern pop 
musicians shy away from. But this 
group erases the brass-instrument 
stigma. (Check out “Came Out of 
a Lady.”) The horns add a level of 
depth unattainable through any 
other musical means, helping to 
create the group’s dynamic sound. 
The brass pieces act as another 
voice of sorts, further expanding 
the range of human emotion 
conveyed through song.

“On a human level, there’s the 

voice and then there’s drums, the 
next level up, because you can 
express yourself on a drum with 
just one stroke. Then I really think 

horns are the next in line in terms 
of an instrument that’s really close 
to humanity and the body. People 
respond to it so strongly, it’s very 
evocative of this primal thing.”

This evocative primal nature 

seems to be resonating strongly 
with fans, as the group has graced 
the stage on “Jimmy Kimmel 
Live” and has taken an extensive 
European tour — exposing them 
to an even broader range of 
listeners. Traver, who studied 
abroad in Paris during her college 
years, felt especially connected to 
the audiences there and felt that it 
was “profoundly special to be able 
to bring (her) art back to the city 
of Paris.” 

Rubblebucket is kicking off 

another U.S. tour in October, 
making a stop at Ann Arbor’s own 
Blind Pig on Saturday, Oct. 3. For 
Traver, the appeal of touring has 
always been about connecting 
with others — through making 
music, through sharing music, 
through self-expression.

“It’s amazing to be in a world 

where you get to look at people 
every night and touch them and 
feel this net of humanity. It’s 
really exciting.”

Dark Side of the Rainbow?

in this series, three daily arts writers in 

varying states of mind visit the same place 

and write about their experiences.

this week’s destination:

Well this has been a shit show and a half. The movie wouldn’t load. We fucked up the timing 

of pressing play, and I’ve sat on a plate of ketchup. Only good thing to come of this was 

the homemade chicken tenders I made and the fact I had an excuse to “do some 

weed,” as my dad would call it, at 6 p.m. on a school night. This is actually 

pretty cool. RIP JUDY GARLAND. I think Dorothy is stoned too, 

tbh. I really want to pet Toto. The drunk one does a dead on 

impression of Judy Garland singing. OK, this is creepy. 

The witch came riding on her broom and the 

music got perfectly terrifying. I forgot 

that I liked this movie, but still hella 

pissed at the whole “you had the power 

to go home all this time” shit. OK do you 

think Dorothy would like pumpkin spice lattes? (I 

do). Buzzed just gave me a history lesson on how this 

movie is an allegory for ’merica switching to the gold stan-

dard. But to me it’s more thematic of like a Beyoncé song. THE 

POWER IS ALL YOURS, do what you damn well want to. And don’t 

let any bitch with a point hat tell u shit. TORNADO I FEEL PARALYZED. 

Glinda was kind of a cunt. Like Dorothy probably has shit to do, send her and her 

little dog the hell home. Glinda is not cute, I thought she was the pretty one. Where’s 

the wicked witch of the south? They kinda just left that lead hanging. This album is actually 

fantastic. To be completely honest when I was a kid I totally wanted to be the wicked witch but 

gender roles are a real bitch during youth. Also I’m a piece of shit, because I’m drinking some wine 

now too. #crossfaded #ihatemyself. Drunk compared our extreme peanut butter eating habits to doing 

meth. Uh .... we got to the oddly sexual part of Dorothy lubing up the Tin Man, but then the YouTube record-
ing stopped. So I guess I’m done here. —DAILY ARTS WRITER

All I know is that my one of my fellow Daily Arts writers just sat on 

ketchup and I saw some underwear and then Pink Floyd started playing.

So we were really excited when we got this to match up. Start play-

ing the album at the lion’s third roar!!! It’s hard to type with this wine 
glass but I’m doing my best. This is eerily matching up right now. I’M SO 
CREEPED OUT WATCHING THIS A BUNCH OF BELLS STARTED 
CLANGING WHEN THE WOMAN THAT PLAYED THE WITCH 
SHOWED UP IN HER FRONTIER GARB.

TOTO CAME BACK AND THE MUSIC GOT HAPPIER.
Low key tho I’ve never listened to this album and I’m really digging it. 

I’m blathering to my fellow writers about how this movie is an allegory 
and the slippers are really gold because of money and fucking America.

IT’S THE TWISTER RIGHT NOW BUT THE MUSIC IS CALM AF. 

Triply stuff. Right when Dork-thy laid down the music chilled out so that 
was strange and amazing and I feel that my life has changed for the bet-
ter.

MONEY IS PLAYING right as she walked into Oz!!!!!!
GLINDA IS A GRENADE I remember her being so hot what is this 

witchcraft?? Was that a pun??? I really need to watch this while sober.

We fell out of sync with it for a while and Nirvana started playing and 

THAT WAS AWESOME. The munchkins are talking now. MY FELLOW 
WRITER JUST SAID THAT MUNCHKINS ARE MENINISTS AND I 
COULDN’T AGREE MORE. I feel so relaxed. Everything is good. Pink 
Floyd is good. The Tin Man slowly getting lubed up is good.

—DAILY ARTS WRITER

To be honest, I’m kind of skeptical about this whole thing. Floyd never admit-

ted to synching the album with the movie and, in all likelihood, a 

bunch of stoners made this whole thing up while tripping on 

some illicit substance. But we shall see. The lion is roar-

ing, and I am pressing play, giving Buzzed a high five 

when we realize we lined everything up correctly. 

Baked just sat in a plate of ketchup. So far this shit 

is looking pretty legit … the music is changing … 
characters are reacting. I’m beginning to appre-
ciate my Bored status. This is trippy enough 
without any inebriation. The twister is coming 
but the music is calm — what’s happening? “This 
is changing my life,” says Baked. “Money” came 
on right as she walked into the colorful munch-
kin land; this probably has some kind of signifi-
cance, but my mind is not vast enough to analyze 

it. Between the three of us, we seem to know a lot 

of random facts about this movie, the implications of 

this are TBD. It just occurred to me that all of Dorothy’s 

helpers are men — where my ladies at?! Somehow we got 

onto the topic of meth, do you think Pink Floyd did meth? 

Theres some real victorious music going on while the Tin Man is 

getting greased up; I feel like I’m watching the end of a war movie or something. 
Alas, the janky YouTube clip we have relied on finally quit on it. It was interesting 
while it lasted, Floyd.

Daily Cultural Cures Columnist

Dear Gillian,
As a freshman this fall, I’m in a 

section led by a graduate student 
instructor who is (1) smart, (2) nice 
and (3) fine as hell. And she looks 
right at me a lot of the time. And 
she’s fine as hell.

I know it’s, like, number two 

on the list of ways to eff-up as a 
freshman, but I can’t help crushing 
on this GSI, hard. I don’t want any 
trouble, but I don’t want to miss 
out either. I’ve been doing a good 
job keeping it my dreams, but in our 
last e-mail exchange, the answers to 
my questions were followed by an 
emoji. Not a hearts one, but a smile 
one with those slightly rosy cheeks 
that could be a blush. At this point, 
I got it bad.

– Hot For Teacher

***

 Dear Hot For Teacher,
The student-teacher forbidden 

love has been chronicled by 
authors and artists through the 
ages. It almost always ends badly. 
The consequences have ranged 
from grade deflation, to litigation, 
to castration, to murderization. Or 
worse, the denial of tenure.

A thing with your GSI is not 

as taboo as a cross-generational 
flirtation with a full professor. The 
dynamic, however, is always going 
to be thornier than a tryst between 
peers.

One story you can look to is that 

of Héloïse and Abélard. These two 
ruffled some feathers 12th century 
Paris. Héloïse d’Argenteuil was 
said to be the best-educated 
woman 
in 
France. 
She 
was 

brought up by her uncle Canon 
Flubert and became a renowned 
scholar and writer. The best was 
paired with the best, and it was 
decided she would study with the 
famous French philosopher and 
theologian Peter Abélard. Well, 
as we all know, private tutoring is 
the perfect opportunity for private 
seduction. The two shared a great 
intellectual, erotic and spiritual 
passion for one another, which 
was not the least bit kosher in the 
Middle Ages.

It seems that when Flubert 

found out about the couple, he was 
livid. Pregnant and unwed, the 
two fled to Brittany and married 
(which Heloise was reluctant to 
do, viewing marriage as a burden 
to her freedom). News of the 
morning-after 
marriage 
began 

to tarnish their reputations and 
careers, and Abélard put Héloïse 
into the convent of Argenteuil to 
be a nun. To Flubert, Abélard’s 
secret seduction, marriage and 
warehousing of Héloïse were 
cowardly and he vowed revenge. 

So he broke into Abélard’s room 
with some friends and castrated 
him. Carrying on, the erstwhile 
lovers corresponded through a 
celebrated series of seven letters in 
which they exchanged insults and 
blame, expressed their despair and 
longing, and pledged their cerebral 
and corporeal devotion.

Now, 
Hot, 
you 
might 
be 

thinking castration is not a legit 
threat in the 21st century. But do 
you even know anything about 
Fine-As-Hell’s 
relationship 
(or 

ex-relationship) status? By the 
time you’re a GSI, you’ve probably 
accumulated a complicated love 
footprint, particularly if you’re fine 
as hell and using a blush emoji with 
a freshman in week three. There 
could be some venomous players 
woven into this web that you’re not 
even aware of.

It doesn’t take Héloise and 

Abélard’s fiery affair that runs 
from wild love to forced celibacy 
to bring trouble to a student and 
teacher that find themselves in a 
sketchy tête-à-tête. David Mamet’s 
(yep, Zosia’s father) two-character 
play “Oleanna” suggests only an 
intention of intimacy between 
professor John and undergraduate 
Carol, yet they were up the creek 
pretty quickly.

Carol goes to her professor’s 

office distraught, complaining the 
material was not well presented 
in his course, and asks for passing 
grade. John is distracted, on the 
verge of being granted tenure 
and closing on a new house, but 
eventually sympathizes with her 
criticism of the academic system 
and decides to help her if she meets 
with him privately to discuss the 
material. At an intense moment, 
he puts his hand on her shoulder 
to comfort her, and she shakes it 
off, visibly upset. Carol returns 
having 
filed 
complaints 
with 

the University (and the tenure 
committee) that John is sexist in 
class and sexually harassed her 
when she met with him. Freaked 
out by how this will affect his 
chance at being tenured, John 
grabs Carol when she tries to storm 
out of her second visit. Pretty soon, 
he’s denied tenure and suspended 
and Carol faced with feelings of 
violation. Things only get worse 
from there. 

Now, Hot, you’re probably 

thinking, “Whoa, whoa, it was 
only an emoji.” But you know what 
they say: emojis are gateway icons 
that just lead to harder keystrokes 
and pretty soon you’re sharing 
peeks on YikYak.

We stereotypically think of 

older men in teaching positions 
seducing 
young, 
ambitious 

schoolgirls. But in Zoe Heller’s 
novel “Notes on a Scandal,” — 

which was made into a film with 
Cate Blanchett and Judi Dench — 
is closer to your situation, flipping 
the script to show us another 
casting of roles. Art teacher at a 
London comprehensive school, 
Sheba Hart, lusts after 15-year 
old student Steven Connolly, and 
it’s not long before they’re having 
sex in risky spots but managing to 
keep the affair hidden.

One problem you can see here, 

H, besides the red light of being 
with a minor, is the conflicting 
concerns of two people at different 
stages of life. As the relationship 
progresses, Sheba becomes more 
and more attached to Steven as he 
inversely loses interest. As middle-
aged adult, with a dusty marriage 
and an insecurity of aging, life is 
moving at a slower pace than it is 
for a teenage boy, and Sheba clings 
to the relationship as she tries to 
cling to her own youth. Although 
the gap between you and Fine-
As-Hell is only around six years, 
consider that she’s worrying about 
getting kicked off her parents’ 
health 
insurance 
and 
you’re 

worrying about getting kicked off 
the line at Skeeps.

In the story, Sheba’s nosey 

friend finds out about the affair 
and starts writing an account of 
the tryst. So clearly, nothing can be 
kept secret. Somehow people will 
always find out, especially when 
proof is as easy as a screenshot of a 
Snapchat of the two of you getting 
cozy at office hours.

Sting, who had worked as an 

English teacher before becoming 
the bassist and lead singer of 
The Police, captured many of 
the pitfalls of student/teacher 
temptations in “Don’t Stand So 
Close to Me,” which I recommend 
you listen to. His advice is to put 
some spatial distance between 
yourselves and the rest will take 
care of itself.

So, Hot for Teacher, if you’re 

not scared out of your mind by 
now and are still clicking through 
your GSIs public profile pictures, 
I’d say wait until next semester 
when you’re no longer in enrolled 
in the class, or better yet next 
year when you lose your frosh 
status. For now, just make an 
impression in class by spicing up 
your comments with some sources 
that flaunt outside research and 
genuine curiosity (I don’t know 
what class it is, but hopefully not 
Psych 494 “Adolescent Sexuality” 
or French 350 “Mistakes.”) Stand 
out and look sharp. Fine-As-Hell 
will remember you in 2016.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

 Halsey is one of those girls. 
You know the ones: They can 
rock the mystical shoulder 
tattoos, 
the Smurf-
blue hair, 
the elusive 
ultra-pixie 
cut, the 
oversized 
band 
T-shirts 
— and 
still look 
completely 
irresistible.
 The thing is, though, 
Halsey’s music is too 
intelligent, too edgy to 
be pigeonholed into that 
basic category of “hipster.” 

Perhaps this stereotyping 
is what she and her clan 
are rebelling against in 
the post-apocalyptic “New 
Americana” video. It’s 
intense, and for the most part, 
convincingly so.
 As our leading lady is 
chilling with her heathens in 
an underground layer, doing 
push-ups and smoking and 
kissing people aggressively 
(typical), she’s captured by 
some fascist dude with a 
really big gun. He drags her 
through the rainforest, ties 
her to a tree and douses her 
in gasoline: apt preparations 
for hipster homicide. Alas, 
Halsey won’t settle for that — 
eccentricity will not be stifled 

ASTRALWERKS

— and in comes La Resistance 
to save the fire-lit night.

 All of this is effective in 
eliciting true fear for the 
singer — one simply must 
watch until the end to 
find out what goes down. 
“New Americana” is the 
perfect backing song for 

the cinematography, too, as 
both the video and music 
extract from each other equal 
amounts of raw, penetrating 
power.
 But as the good-looking 
group is sprinting to safety 
at the end, one can’t help 
but think of the typicality 
of it all. The video straight 
up looks like it’s from “The 
Hunger Games” if Urban 
Outfitters had been the 
executive producer. In a 
time where sexy sci-fi tales 
of young-adult upheaval are 
more than overdone, Halsey’s 
originality is best suited to a 
far less clichéd format.
